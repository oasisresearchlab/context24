Separation of artiﬁcial mem - branes into liquid - ordered ( Lo ) and liquid - disordered phases is regarded as a common model for this compartmentalization . However , tight lipid packing in Lo phases seems to conﬂict with efﬁcient partitioning of raft - associated transmembrane ( TM ) pro - teins . To assess membrane order as a component of raft organi - zation , we performed ﬂuorescence spectroscopy and microscopy with the membrane probes Laurdan and C - laurdan . First , we assessed lipid packing in model membranes of various composi - tions and found cholesterol and acyl chain dependence of mem - brane order . Then we probed cell membranes by using two novel systems that exhibit inducible phase separation : giant plasma membrane vesicles [ Baumgart et al . ( 2007 ) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104 : 3165 – 3170 ] and plasma membrane spheres . Notably , only the latter support selective inclusion of raft TM proteins with the ganglioside GM1 into one phase . We measured comparable small differences in order between the separated phases of both biomembranes . Lateral packing in the ordered phase of giant plasma membrane vesicles resembled the Lo domain of model membranes , whereas the GM1 phase in plasma membrane spheres exhibited considerably lower order , consistent with different par - titioning of lipid and TM protein markers . Thus , lipid - mediated coalescence of the GM1 raft domain seems to be distinct from the formation of a Lo phase , suggesting additional interactions be - tween proteins and lipids to be effective . generalized polarization value ! giant unilamellar vesicle ! membrane organization ! lipid sorting ! lipid raft T he lipid raft hypothesis postulates that selective interactions among sphingolipids , cholesterol , and membrane proteins con - tribute to lateral membrane heterogeneity ( 1 ) . A tenet of the model is that small , dynamic cholesterol - sphingolipid - enriched assemblies can be induced to coalesce into larger , more stable structures through clustering of domain components ( 2 ) . Although experi - mental data support cholesterol - dependent nano - scale membrane heterogeneity ( 3 – 8 ) and selective domain formation upon raft cross - linking ( 9 – 12 ) , the mechanisms that govern such associations in cell membranes remain unclear . On the molecular level , a key feature that is thought to contribute to raft assembly is the propensity of cholesterol to pack tightly with saturated acyl chains of lipids causing them to adopt an extended conformation ( 13 , 14 ) . Inmulti - componentmodelmembranes ( n ! 2 ) , this interaction can lead to microscopically separate fluid membrane phases : the liquid - ordered ( Lo ) phase , enriched in saturated ( sphingo - ) lipids and cholesterol in a highly condensed state , andtheliquid - disordered ( Ld ) phase , enrichedinunsaturated glycerophospholipid in a disordered state ( 15 – 17 ) . Several features of the Lo phase in model membranes corre - spond to the predicted properties of lipid rafts in cell membranes ( 15 , 18 ) . Also in terms of protein segregation , GPI - anchored proteins , which are raft - associated in native membranes , partition into the Lo phase ( 19 , 20 ) . However , one difference is striking : raft - associating transmembrane ( TM ) proteins have been shown to be excluded ( 21 – 24 ) , suggesting energetic constraints for TM ! - helices partitioning into the tightly packed Lo phase as expected from the potential disordering effect of the amino acid side chains of the TM domain ( 18 , 24 ) . In live cell membranes , segregation into microscopic Lo - like and Ld - like phases has not been observed . However , two recent studies have demonstrated that , under certain conditions , microscopic phase separation can occur in biomembranes ( 25 – 27 ) . Baumgart and colleagues used formaldehyde membrane blebbing to generate giant plasma membrane vesicles ( GPMVs ) , which separate into a very ordered and a disordered phase upon cooling as judged by the partitioning of typical lipid phase markers ( 25 ) . As in model membranes , the ordered phase excluded all native TM proteins tested ( 26 ) . In an alternative approach , Lingwood and coworkers ( 27 ) used a cell swelling procedure to generate membrane preparations called plasma membrane spheres ( PMS ) . By addition of cholera toxin B ( CtxB ) , phase separation was induced by clustering of the raft ganglioside GM1 at 37 °C . Significantly , in this case , raft TM proteins were selectively enriched in the GM1 phase , whereas the transferrin receptor , used as a marker for a non - raft protein , was excluded . As formation of a Lo - like membrane environment is predicted for lipid raft domains ( 15 , 18 , 22 ) , we were interested in how the membraneorderofplasmamembrane - derivedvesiclescomparesto LoandLdphasesofmodelmembranesandwhetherthedifferencesinseparationbehaviorandproteininclusivitybetweenGPMVsandPMSaresomehowreflectedinthedegreeoflipidpacking . Lipid packing can be determined with fluorescent membrane probes such as 6 - dodecanoyl - 2 - dimethylaminonaphthalene ( Laur - dan ) ( 28 – 30 ) . When integrated into the bilayer , the wavelength of the emission peak of the dye is dependent on the presence of water in the membrane . Because water penetration into the bilayer is directly related to inter - lipid spacing , Laurdan has been used to measure the degree of lipid packing ( 31 ) . From the contribution of its blue emission band ( I Ch1 ) and red emission band ( I Ch2 ) , the generalized polarization ( GP ) value can be calculated as a relative measure for membrane order ( 28 ) : GP " I Ch1 # I Ch2 I Ch1 $ I Ch2 . [ 1 ] GP values are obtained by spectroscopy ( GP s ) or by microscopy ( GP m ) and can theoretically assume values from " 1 ( being most ordered ) and - 1 ( being least ordered ) .

To gain better understanding about the principles of lipid - based phase separation in biomembranes , we used both Laurdan and C - laurdan to analyze lipid packing in model membranes in com - parison with phase - separated GPMVs and PMS . By using fluores - cence spectroscopy and microscopy , we first tested how lipid composition and a TM peptide affected the order of model membranes . We found acyl chain saturation and cholesterol to strongly increase the packing state , whereas a model TM peptide did not have an impact . When we probed the separated phases of GPMVs and PMS , increases in membrane condensation were seen fortheGPMVorderedandthePMSGM1phase . Orderdifferences between coexisting phases were small and comparable in both systems . However , the level of packing in the temperature - dependent GPMV system was similar to model membrane Lo phase but was much greater than that observed for the GM1 phase formed in PMS . These differences in lipid packing were consistent with the partitioning behavior of lipid and TM protein markers between the phases in the plasma membrane preparations . Results Fluorescence Spectroscopy . GP s valuesofLoandLdphasesinpureand binarymodelmembranes . To first estimate the packing effect of single lipid species , we analyzed simple one - and two - component lipid mixtures with known phase behavior ( 15 ) . Having confirmed that Laurdan and C - laurdan partition equally between Lo and Ld membranes ( Fig . S1 and Table S1 ) , we stained large unilamellar vesicles ( LUVs ) and recorded emission spectra ( Fig . S2 ) . We used Lo LUVs composed of egg sphingomyelin ( ESM ) and cholesterol ( Chol ) ( 1 : 1 ) , LUVs with coexisting Lo and Ld phases with palmi - toyl - oleoyl - phosphatidylcholine ( POPC ) / Chol ( 3 : 2 ) , and 2 Ld LUVs composed of pure POPC and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine ( DOPC ) , respectively . BetweentheLo - typeESM / Cholmixtureand the Ld DOPC mixture , we found the biggest GP s differences . The GP s values of the two preparations were 0 . 57 # 0 . 00 and - 0 . 24 # 0 . 00 for Laurdan and 0 . 51 # 0 . 00 and - 0 . 36 # 0 . 01 for C - laurdan ( Fig . 1 A ) , which reflected large differences in lipid packing between pure Lo and Ld membrane phases . Compared with the Ld phase of DOPC , the Ld phase of POPC was more ordered , with - 0 . 05 # 0 . 00 for Laurdan and - 0 . 29 # 0 . 00 for C - laurdan ( Fig . 1 A ) , indicating that replacement of the C18 : 1 chain with the shorter , saturated C16 : 1 chain caused a considerable ordering of the Ld membrane . Moreover , Laurdan reported this change with a more pronounced GP s shift . Addition of 40 mol % Chol to POPC results in the formation of a coexisting Lo phase ( 15 ) . Accordingly , we found a strong increase in the GP s value for this composition to 0 . 42 # 0 . 00 for Laurdan and 0 . 27 # 0 . 00 for C - laurdan ( Fig . 1 A ) that mirrors the average GP level for coexisting Lo - Ld systems being intermediate between pure Lo and Ld phases . GP s values of Lo and Ld phases in ternary model membranes . Next , we analyzed ternary model membranes containing POPC , ESM , and Chol for the major lipid classes found in eukaryotic membranes . The phase behavior of this mixture has been characterized previ - ously ( 15 ) . We prepared Lo LUVs of POPC / ESM / Chol at 25 : 35 : 40 ( Lo ) , two different types of LUVs with coexisting Lo and Ld phase with ratios of 45 : 30 : 25 ( Lo - Ld 1 ) and 60 : 28 : 12 ( Lo - Ld 2 ) , respec - tively , and Ld LUVs with a ratio of 70 : 25 : 05 ( Ld ) . Laurdan and C - laurdan showed decreasing GP s values for the 4 ternary compositions in the order Lo , Lo - Ld 1 , Lo - Ld 2 , and Ld ( Fig . 1 B ) , implying that that high ratios of sphingolipid - cholesterol to glycerophospholipid correlate with high membrane order . GP s valuesofternarymodelmembranescontainingprotein . As biomem - branes contain high amounts of protein , we tested whether a TM peptide influenced the GP s value . We reconstituted the synthetic LW peptide ( acetyl - K 2 W 2 L 8 AL 8 W 2 K 2 - amide ) at 0 . 5 and 2 . 0 mol % into LUVs of POPC / ESM / Chol 45 : 25 : 30 according to Fastenberg etal . ( 24 ) .

We then made use of the potential to measure membrane order with the dyes by two - photon microscopy . Using Lo - Ld phase - separated giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) of stearyl - sphingomyelin ( SSM ) , DOPC , and Chol ( 2 : 2 : 1 ) , we could obtain individual values for the coexisting phases . To visualize phase separation , we used the Ld marker lissamine - rhodamine B - dio - leoylphosphatidylethanolamine ( Rh - DOPE ) . From the blue chan - nel ( Ch1 ) and the red channel ( Ch2 ) of the order - sensing dyes , artificial GP m images ( e . g . , spatially resolved order maps ) were calculated ( see Materials and Methods and SI Text ) . Because of the difference between the microscopy and the spectroscopy setup , the GP m scale was slightly broader compared with the GP s scale .

The GP m values of the Lo and Ld phase were 0 . 91 # 0 . 01 and 0 . 17 # 0 . 08 for Laurdan and 0 . 81 # 0 . 04 and - 0 . 34 # 0 . 01 for C - laurdan , respectively ( Fig . 2 B ) . As in the spectroscopy results , the order differences between Lo and Ld phase were quite large . Marker partitioning in phase - separated plasma membrane - derived vesi - cles . Next , we analyzed phase - separated GPMVs and PMS to comparetheirpropertiestoLoandLdphasesofmodelmembranes . These biomembrane systems show separation of lipids and proteins , albeit at different selectivity . We produced GPMVs and PMS from A431 cells with the methods described by Baumgart et al . ( 25 ) and Lingwood et al . ( 27 ) , respectively . Cells had been transfected with the raft protein LAT TM domain carrying a monomeric red fluorescent protein ( mRFP ; LAT - TMD - mRFP ) and were labeled with different fluorescent CtxBs , Rh - DOPE ( GUVs and GPMVs ) , and DiD ( PMS ) afterward . PMS and GUVs were then imaged at 20 °C ( room temperature ) whereas GPMVs from A431 cells re - quired cooling to 10 °C to phase - separate . We confirmed the findings by Sengupta et al . ( 26 ) that the Ld marker Rh - DOPE and LAT - TMD - mRFP get excluded from the GM1 - enriched phase of the GPMVs marked by the CtxB label ( Fig . 3 A and B ) . The same behavior has also been reported for GUVs ( 22 ) . Strikingly , markers showed a different distribution in the PMS , where LAT - TMD - mRFP was selectively enriched in the GM1 phase but the Ld marker DiD did not show selective partitioning into either phase ( Fig . 3 B ) . This implied that the PMS domain containing the sphingolipid GM1 is selective for a TM raft marker and at the same time permeable to an Ld marker , whereas the GM1 - enriched phase of GPMVs were neither permeable nor selectively enriched in any of the markers . GP m imagingofphase - separatedplasmamembrane - derivedvesicles . We assessed whether the differences in marker partitioning were also reflected in the order of the phases in comparison with model membrane Lo and Ld phases . As before , we prepared GPMVs and PMSs from A431 cells . These had been stained with Laurdan and C - laurdan before vesicle induction and labeled with the phase marker CtxB - Alexa555 ( PMS ) or with Rh - DOPE ( GPMVs ) after - ward . Again , PMS were imaged at 20 °C room temperature and GPMVs were cooled to 10 °C to phase - separate . Accordingly GUVs were also measured at 10 °C . To rule out a bias in the GP m value caused by this temperature shift , we confirmed that the lipid - independent temperature effect on the dye emission lies within the error of the measurement ( Fig . S3 ) . We found a significant difference in the order parameters between the phases , with the ordered and disordered phases of GPMVs having GP m values of 0 . 70 # 0 . 03 and 0 . 51 # 0 . 04 with C - laurdan ( Fig . 4 A and B ) and 0 . 80 # 0 . 01 and 0 . 68 # 0 . 02 with Laurdan , respectively ( Fig . S4 A and B ) . The differences between phases ( i . e . , % GP m ) were thus 0 . 19 # 0 . 05 for C - laurdan and 0 . 13 # 0 . 03 for Laurdan . When the GUVs were cooled down , only the Ld phase exhibited a significant change in the GP m value . It increased by 0 . 04 # 0 . 02 GP m units for C - laurdan and by 0 . 13 # 0 . 09 units for Laurdan . We also found a significant difference in the GP m levels between the two phases in PMS . The GM1 phase and the remaining membrane phase showed GP m s of 0 . 28 # 0 . 04 and 0 . 10 # 0 . 05 with C - laurdan and 0 . 61 # 0 . 4 and 0 . 54 # 0 . 03 with Laurdan , respec - tively ( Fig . 4 C and D and Fig . S4 C and D ) . The differences ( % GP m ) amountedto0 . 17 # 0 . 06forC - laurdanand0 . 07 # 0 . 05forLaurdan . Thus , both GPMVs and PMS had a comparable small GP m difference between the phases ; however , GPMVs showed a high degree of packing similar to the Lo phase whereas PMS were significantly less ordered . To rule out that this order gap between PMS GM1 phase and the Lo phase was not merely a temperature effect , we also measured PMS at 10 °C . Even though we found a slight increase in order for both PMS phases , still , the Lo phase of GUVs was far more ordered ( Fig . S5 B ) . Thus , the striking result is that the raft phase in PMS is less ordered than Lo phase .

Lipid rafts—ordered assemblies of sphin - golipid , cholesterol , and certain membrane proteins—are thought to be key components for the dynamic compartmentalization . Separation of model membranes into Lo and Ld phases is often considered a model for this phenomenon ( 15 , 19 ) ; nevertheless , striking discrepancies remain ( 20 , 22 ) . To gain insight into potential mechanisms of raft assembly , we tested in this study how order - induced lateral segregation in model membranes compares to domain separation in plasma membrane preparations . In addition to protein and lipid markers , we made use of two order - sensing probes—Laurdan and C - laurdan—that we first compared in a systematic way . Correlation of Model Membrane Composition and Order . In our LUV experiments , we found a strong correlation between membrane composition and order as expected ( 36 ) . Increasing amounts of partially saturated lipids and cholesterol led to higher membrane packing ( Fig . 1 A ) . In a ternary mixture that contained represen - tative species of the main lipid classes of eukaryotic membranes— ESM , POPC , and cholesterol—small compositional changes could be well resolved ( Fig . 1 B ) . This trend could also be confirmed for more complex samples such as yeast membranes ( 37 ) . Moreover , GP s values were not discrete for the phase states but changed with lipid composition , decreasing in value from Lo phases to coexisting Lo - Ld phases and Ld phases ( Fig . 1 B and SI Text ) ( 38 ) . Notably , highamountsoftheLWTMpeptideaffectedmembraneorderonlymarginallyinthecompositiontested ( Fig . 1 C ) , which suggests that lipid composition is the key factor to determine membrane order . Both Laurdan and C - laurdan behaved similarly . The main differ - ences were that ( i ) the GP range is shifted to lower values with C - laurdan ( Fig . 1 ) ; ( ii ) Laurdan was more sensitive in the low GP region , whereas C - laurdan discriminated packing states over the whole GP range more evenly ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) ; and ( iii ) equilibration times during staining were much shorter for C - laurdan ( SI Text ) . Analysis of Phase Separation in Plasma Membranes . Our main goal in this study was to shed light on the principles that govern lipid - mediated phase separation in eukaryotic membranes , specifically focusing on the role of membrane order . Two types of plasma membrane - derived vesicles have become available to investigate inducible phase separation : GPMVs and PMS . Compared with simple model systems , these have a complex lipid and protein composition containing thousands of different lipids and mem - brane proteins ( 25 , 27 ) . Moreover , these systems lend themselves to dye - based order measurements by microscopy as a result of their micrometer - sized phases and the lack of artifacts from irregular membrane morphology ( 39 ; SI Text ) . If cells are treated with the protein cross - linker formaldehyde , blebbing of the surface membrane into GPMVs is induced ( 25 ) . Coolingto10 °ChasbeenshowntoreversiblyseparateGPMVsinto a highly ordered phase and a disordered phase . In agreement with other studies ( 25 , 26 ) , we show that the raft marker LAT - TMD - mRFP and the Ld marker Rh - DOPE enrich in the disordered phase whereas CtxB - labeled GM1 is found in the ordered phase ( Fig . 3 ) . When we then used C - laurdan and Laurdan on the vesicles , the striking result was that the measured GP m values were high ( Fig . 4 and Fig . S5 ) . At 10 °C , the ordered phase had a GP m value close to that of the Lo phase in GUVs , demonstrating that the conden - sation state of these two phases is very similar . Also , the disordered phase had a GP m value only 0 . 19 units less for C - laurdan and 0 . 13 units less for Laurdan . Such small GP m differences imply that the two phases separating in GPMVs are energetically close and highly miscible , in agreement with their temperature - dependent separa - tion . Furthermore , the disordered phase exhibited a considerably higher order than pure Ld phases in simple model systems , sug - gesting that it is distinct from a pure Ld membrane .

First , as cholesterol concentration is more than 40 % in plasma membranes ( 40 , 41 ) , not only the ordered but also the disordered phase of GPMVs likely contains considerable amounts of cholesterol , increasing the pack - ing in the membrane . In addition , both phases are above the order of the unseparated GPMVs at 20 °C ( Fig . S5 A ) , indicating that the lower temperature increases the overall order in the membrane . As our spectroscopic data show , high GP values close to the Lo level are suggestive of coexisting Lo and Ld phases ( Fig . 1 A and B ) . As the unseparated GPMVs also displayed a high GP m value at 20 °C ( Fig . S5 A ) , the vesicles probably contain pre - existing nano - scopic domains in a microscopically uniform phase as previously suggested by Baumgart et al . and others ( 25 , 42 ) . Indeed , recent reports propose that GPMVs have a composition close to a critical point at which a decrease in temperature coalesces pre - existing nano - domains into a microscopic phase ( 43 ) . A potential artifact of the GPMV system is that formaldehyde cross - linking likely affects the native membrane composition , pre - sumably by formation of covalently coupled protein complexes . Lipid packing was not affected under the relevant conditions ( Fig . S6 ) . How far the chemical treatment biases the system toward the behavior observed in model membranes in which TM proteins typically become depleted from the Lo phase remains to be elucidated . The other membrane system that we analyzed was generated by subjecting cells to hypotonic swelling ( 27 ) . With this procedure , the plasma membrane forms a sphere ( i . e . , a PMS ) . A phase separation of the membrane is induced by clustering cell surface GM1 with cholera toxin at 37 °C . In contrast to Lo phases in model mem - branes ( 22 ) and to the ordered phase in GPMVs ( 26 ) , proteins selectively partition between the PMS phases . Raft proteins ( GPI - anchored , doubly acylated , or TM ) are included in the GM1 phase whereas a non - raft TM protein , the transferrin receptor , is ex - cluded . Accordingly , the LAT - TMD - mRFP is enriched in the GM1 phase . However , the Ld marker DiD does not show a selective enrichment in either phase ( Fig . 3 ) . Apparently , the lipid can easily penetrate the GM1 phase . This suggests that the partitioning criteria for proteins and lipid markers are quite different from Lo and Ld phases of model membranes . When we analyzed the order of the phases , we still found that the GM1 phase was more ordered than the remainder phase . The difference in packing between the phases measured with both C - laurdan and Laurdan was small , as with GPMVs . Strikingly , the GP m value of the GM1 phase was significantly lower than the Lo phase in GUVs even upon cooling to 10 °C ( Fig . 4 and Figs . S4 and S5 ) , implying that the GM1 phase is not as condensed as the highly packed Lo phase of the model membrane . Considering that phase formation seen in PMS was induced at 37 °C and did not require cooling ( 27 ) , our GP m data in combination with the marker results suggest that lipid - mediated coalescence of the GM1 raft domain is distinct from the formation of a coherent Lo phase . How exactly this protein - selective GM1 domain assembles is not understood . It seems that formation of a Lo - type membrane phase by the interaction of cholesterol with saturated acyl chains is insufficient to explain domain formation on its own . Rather , the characteristics of the GM1 phase are likely to be determined by its complex lipid and protein composition . The TM raft proteins must become inherent constituents of a network of lipid - lipid and lipid - protein interactions that determine the properties of this bilayer environment . Our studies demonstrate that the three membrane systems analyzed here represent a spectrum of different bilayer behaviors . The Lo - Ld model membrane system we used showed a striking difference in the packing density within its two phases . In contrast , the order differences between the two separating phases in GPMVs and PMSs were much smaller . It cannot be ruled out that the partial loss of membrane asymmetry dampens more pronounced differ - ences present in native membranes ( 44 ) . However , we propose that this small energetic gap in order is rather the result of the compo - sitional complexity of the two phases in the plasma membrane preparations , as similar differences have also been reported for other domains in intact biomembranes such as the T cell synapse ( 45 ) and Golgi - derived transport vesicles ( 37 ) . In addition to the interaction of cholesterol with saturated hydrocarbon chains that brings about Lo - Ld - type phase separation in model membranes , additional lateral associations come into play in cell membranes : ( i ) hydrogen bond networks mediated by the backbone chemistry of sphingolipids ( 1 , 46 – 48 ) , ( ii ) specific protein - lipid interactions ( 18 , 49 , 50 ) , ( iii ) homo - andheterotypicproteininteractions ( 51 , 52 ) , and ( iv ) glycan - based interaction with proteins and other glycans ( 53 , 54 ) . In this regard , GM1 phase formation in PMS probably involves contributionsfromtheseinteractionsthatbringinanewquality : the selective integration of raft TM proteins . The capability of phase separation , e . g . , selective de - mixing , seems to reflect an inherent property of cell membranes that probably co - evolved with increas - ing chemical complexity .
