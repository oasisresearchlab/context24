JAffEE U nless your head is buried deep in the sand , you know we are in a credit crunch . But what ex - actly does that mean ? It doesn’t mean that interest rates are out of sight . In fact , mortgage rates are near his - toric lows and interest rates on BBB investment grade bonds are back below 8 % . 1 Do these moderate interest rates mean that the Troubled Asset Recovery Program ( “TARP” ) is working to ease the crunch ? Under TARP , the government pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into banks in the hopes that they would increase lending . What hap - pened to that money ? Did they lend it out ? Did they buy other banks or pay bonuses as Casey Mulligan and others have worried ? A look at the reserves held by de - pository institutions in Table 1 suggests one part of the answer . Pause now to have a look at column 4 of the table . Although Jamie Dimon , the Presi - dent of JP Morgan Chase , Kenneth Lewis of Bank of America , and other bank executives recently testified to Congress about their ample lending efforts , 2 excess reserves have risen to dizzying heights . In August 2008 they were a fairly normal 2 billion dollars . By January 2009 they were 798 billion dollars . Stop . Read that again . 798 Aaron S .

Think about that figure . Remember the massive credit crunch in August 2007 when the subprime crisis first be - came apparent to the world ? At that time , real estate investors said their business had shut down overnight , and you can see the effects in the reserve numbers . Banks were so nervous then that excess reserves tripled from $ 1 . 6 billion in July 2007 to $ 4 . 8 billion in August 2007 . Impressive to be sure . But nothing com - pared to now : even after tumbling in February , excess reserves were a whopping $ 643 billion at month end . Thars the problem folks . Or if not the problem , one heckuva symptom . The Federal Reserve makes these figures available since 1959 on the web . Before 2007 , the highest excess reserves ever got as a percent - age of required reserves was 50 % . Now excess reserves are 1100 % of required reserves . To ap - preciate the enormity of these reserves ( and the fear that must be causing them ) , consider that the 50 % number was from September , 2001 , and you can bet dollars to donuts that was from fear caused by September 11 . If we exclude Sep - tember 2001 , then the highest excess reserves ever got pre - 2007 was 7 % of required reserves . What would happen if banks lent these ex - cess reserves out or cut them by $ 400 billion ? Might that restart the economy ? It certainly might . After all , $ 400 billion is itself a lot of money . But even more impressive , according to a standard model of banking where the reserve ratio is 10 % , cutting excess reserves by $ 400 bil - lion would increase the M1 money supply and bank loans by as much as $ 4 trillion , because of what is known as the money multiplier . That would increase bank loans outstanding by more than 50 % of their current amount . 3 why won ’ t banks lend their $ 643 billion of excess reserves ? W hy are banks content to leave all this money parked at the Fed at trivial inter - est ? One reason may be that the bank regula - tors won’t allow them to loan out the money because their capitalization is too low . Another is that the banks themselves think that their capitalization is too low and they must keep the money rather than lend it and thereby al - low their capitalization ratio to decrease even further . Still another factor is that , somewhat ironically , the Federal Reserve has started to pay interest on excess reserves , a change that increases bank incentive to hold , rather than to lend , these reserves . Let’s look at these alternatives . First , consider the regulatory capital re - quirements . Banks are required to finance certain proportions of their total assets with capital ( as opposed to deposits ) . The reason is that capital is captive whereas deposits can run . Banks considered “well capitalized” by the regulators generally hold capital equal to at least 8 % of their “risk - based” assets according to Douglas Elliott of the Brookings Institution . Cash assets held at the Federal Reserve are con - sidered risk - free and therefore face no capital requirements . As a bank lends out its excess reserves , however , its required capital will rise , possibly forcing the bank to raise new capital . There is a stark difference between the views of the regulators and those of the markets on bank capitalization . As recently as February 23 , 2009 , The Federal Reserve has declared the ma - jor banks all to be “well capitalized , ” the highest standard set . 4 Hence regulators would not ap - pear to be standing in the way of lending . The markets , however , seem to think dif - ferently . Citibank stock closed at $ 1 / share on Friday , March 6 , 2009 , giving it a market -  - The Economists’ Voice March 2009 capitalization of under $ 6 billion . 5 Given that Citi’s total assets as of year - end 2008 were just under $ 2 trillion , 6 the market seems to think its effective capital ratio is under 0 . 5 % . What explains the difference ? One is tempted to say that the stock mar - ket takes into account people’s views of the future and realizes that housing values are likely to fall farther and drive bank losses , which will reduce equity farther . To the extent that accounting is based on historical values or mark to bad models , the regulators might not pick up this low capitalization problem . It is also possible that the market is factoring in fears that the regulators will soon close the bank , whatever is its intrinsic value . On the other hand much of the securitized assets are being marked to market or to models that our colleagues studying the matter , Nancy Wallace and Richard Stanton , say dramatically under - value the assets , implicitly assuming that an unrealistically large number of mortgages will default . So whose view is right ? Only time will tell who is right , but if the regulators are really convinced that capitaliza - tion is adequate , it makes one wonder whether they shouldn’t require that reserves be lent , as Swapan Dasgupta has suggested in The Econo - mists’ Voice . Likewise , it makes us wonder why the Fed is now paying interest on reserves ( al - though the interest rate is now only 0 . 25 % ) ? 7 We doubt that this interest rate is sufficiently high to explain why banks aren’t lending , but at the same time , it hardly seems geared to induce lending . If we are worried about bank capitaliza - tion , despite the Fed’s reassurance , this brings us to proposals by Luigi Zingales and others to recapitalize the banks by forcing a swap of debt for equity , which would increase bank capital - ization much as would the government swap - ping preferred stock for equity in Citigroup , as is currently under discussion . Historically , regulators have used required debt for equity swaps only after they have closed a bank , so to accomplish this with a still - functioning bank would probably require Congressional action . should we try to induce banks to lend more ? I n their more candid moments , bankers are saying that they would be delighted to lend more if only they could find more creditworthy borrowers . Of course , there is likely a distinction in this downturn between the private incentives to lend and the social benefits , which would include getting the economy moving again . After all , the reason many business projects are not creditworthy is because the project’s prospective customers are cutting back since they too can’t get credit . Re - cessions involve a coordination failure which tends to make the social return to loans higher than the private return . Could we stimulate the economy by setting a maximum on excess reserves as suggested by Swapan Dasgupta , or a tax on reserves as suggested by Scott Sumner ? A tax on excess reserves is a policy equivalent to paying a neg - ative interest rate on reserves , and would ac - count for the perceived social value of lending out reserves in excess of private value . Suppose a policy of negative interest rates on reserves were used to drive down excess re - serves by a few hundred billion dollars . ( One might for example imagine a tax imposed on excess reserves that exceed seven times re - quired reserves ) . Assuming that the Fed does not allow total bank reserves to fall , which the Fed can prevent by buying Treasuries with open market operations , banks would need to -  - The Economists’ Voice March 2009 loan more money out or return deposits and force depositors to find other places to lend their money or invest it . Sure , some loans would go bad . But even bad loans are as likely to stimulate the economy as the stimulus pack - age . And wouldn’t the average loan ( made in a credit crunch ) be more likely to be spent in a nonwasteful way than a sudden surge in gov - ernment spending ? And can’t the nation’s idle loan officers be put to work faster than the gov - ernment can surge spending ? If loans are as vital as everyone seems to believe , would it be so wrong to step in the way of the massive accumulation of ex - cess reserves ? Although we are not certain it will work , we doubt it would do much harm . To be sure , people will argue , and the mar - kets agree , that the banks are in shaky fi - nancial condition and this mitigates against them making loans . But the solution to that is more likely some kind of recapitalization than hoarding cash at the Fed .

A multiplier of 10 assumes that total bank reserves at the Fed ( the sum of required and excess ) , currency held in bank vaults and currency held by the pub - lic remain constant . Total reserves are determined by Federal Reserve policy , so a bank or the banking system can eliminate excess reserves only by cre - ating new loans and deposits .
