COMMENTARY Working Memory Facilitates Insight Instead of Hindering It : Comment on DeCaro , Van Stockum , and Wieth ( 2016 ) Adam Chuderski and Jan Jastrze˛bski Jagiellonian University The “nothing - special” account of insight predicts positive correlations of insight problem solving and working memory capacity ( WMC ) , whereas the “special - process” account expects no , or even negative , correlations . In the latter vein , DeCaro , Van Stockum Jr . , and Wieth ( 2016 ) have recently reported weak negative WMC correlations with 2 constraint relaxation matchstick problems and 3 insight problems , and thus they claim that WM hinders insight . Here , we report on 3 studies that investigated WMC and various matchstick and classical problems ( including 1 study that precisely replicated DeCaro et al . ’s procedure ) . All 3 studies yielded moderate positive correlations of WMC with both the constraint relaxation and the classical problems . WMC explained 10 % variance in problem solving , no matter what problems were used or how they were applied . Thus , DeCaro et al . ’s claim that WM hinders insight is unwarranted . The opposite is true : WM facilitates insight . Keywords : insight problem solving , matchstick problems , working memory capacity , fluid reasoning So - called insight problems , just as well - defined problems , solv - able by means of analytical , incremental strategies , have only one correct solution . However , regardless of the efforts made , this solution cannot usually be reached using such strategies , because the insight problem description elicits an ineffective problem rep - resentation ( an impasse occurs ) . To solve such a problem , one has to ( re ) represent it from a different perspective . Once its represen - tation is properly restructured , the solution often rapidly comes to mind . Although there is no actual definition of “good” insight problems ( Batchelder & Alexander , 2012 ) , usually descriptions of such problems are equivocal , suggest initial interpretations un - likely to lead to the correct solution and mislead about the right interpretation . Ignoring these descriptions eases reaching the cor - rect solution , which is quickly found under the right interpretation , relies on common sense , and is obvious both to solvers when found and to nonsolvers when revealed ( sometimes yielding the phenom - enological experience of insight or “Aha ! ” ) . Although in principle every insight problem can be solved without restructuring and without insight ( e . g . , by analysis , analogy , or trial and error ; see Danek , Wiley , & Öllinger , 2016 ; Fleck & Weisberg , 2013 ) , many theorists ( Batchelder & Alexander , 2012 ; Ohlsson , 2011 ; Weis - berg , 2006 ) believe that studying insight problem solving in a laboratory indeed can help us , to some extent , to understand creative and flexible thinking in real art , science , and technology problems . Insight was investigated by Gestalt psychology ( e . g . , Maier , 1930 ; Wallas , 1926 ) , which viewed it as a sudden change in the problem representation . This line of research has been revived in the neo - Gestaltian theories of insight ( e . g . , Metcalfe & Wiebe , 1987 ; Ohlsson , 2011 ) , like the representational change theory ( Knoblich , Ohlsson , Haider , & Rhenius , 1999 ) . It predicts that initial unsuccessful attempts to solve an insight problem are fol - lowed by the relaxation of unnecessary constraints that block access to the correct solution , as well as by a decomposition of the problem chunks into simpler pieces of information . The most effective insights come from holistic relaxations and decomposi - tions ( “a new perspective” ) . The “special - process” account claims that insight is a qualitatively different process in comparison to analytic problem solving ( Ohlsson , 2011 ) . In contrast , the “nothing - special” approach treats insight prob - lem solving as involving the same elementary processes—includ - ing perception , imagination , attention , memory , learning—that underlie analytic thinking , with the only difference being that insight problem solving often consists of an all - or - nothing , instead of a gradual , access to a solution ( Perkins , 1981 ; Weisberg & Alba , 1981 ) . For example , the progress monitoring theory ( MacGregor , Ormerod , & Chronicle , 2001 ) proposes that people start solving an insight problem with a hill - climbing strategy , which is useful in analytic problems , but not—in insight problems . However , at some point people represent in their working memory ( WM ) —the lim - ited capacity mechanism of active maintenance and transformation of information for the sake of a current task ( Cowan , 2001 ) —the whole hill - climbing path available to them ( they “look ahead” ) . When they realize that this path cannot lead to the solution , they Adam Chuderski and Jan Jastrze˛bski , Cognitive Science Department , Institute of Philosophy , Jagiellonian University .

In consequence , the higher the individual WM capacity ( WMC ) to look ahead , the more probable is the restructuring . In contrast , the special - process account predicts no link between WMC and in - sight , as the latter is not meant to rely on regular cognitive processing . The evidence on the relationship between insight problem solv - ing and WMC is mixed . Several studies have reported significant positive correlations between WMC and classical insight problems ( e . g . , Chein , Weisberg , Streeter , & Kwok , 2010 ; Chuderski , 2014a ; Gilhooly & Fioratou , 2009 ) . Other studies ( e . g . , Chein & Weisberg , 2014 ; De Dreu , Nijstad , Baas , Wolsink , & Roskes , 2012 ; Storm & Angello , 2010 ) showed such effects for compound remote associates ( triples of words , for which only one existing semantic associate can be found ; e . g . , captain , hotel , sky ¡ stars ) . However , Wiley and Jarosz ( 2012 ) reviewed some evidence ( e . g . , Ash & Wiley , 2006 ; Beilock & DeCaro , 2007 ) , suggesting that overefficient WM and attention control may result in too strong focus on the initial problem representation , and in consequence may harm insight problem solving . Probably the most surprising study in this vein has recently been published by DeCaro , Van Stockum Jr . , and Wieth ( 2016 ) in this journal . It used the matchstick problems developed by Knoblich et al . ( 1999 ) , which require arithmetic operations ( plus , minus , and equal ) to be applied to Roman numerals composed from match - sticks . A matchstick problem consists of an arithmetic statement that is incorrect . The task is to move one , and only one , matchstick to another position in order to make the statement correct . Incre - mental , combinatorial problems ( standard type [ ST ] ) require mov - ing a matchstick from one numeral to another in such a way that a resulting combination of numbers retains the arithmetic operators ( e . g . , I (cid:2) V (cid:3) IV ¡ I (cid:2) V (cid:3) VI ) , but the value constraint becomes relaxed ( i . e . , an arbitrary change in just one value , what is prohibited by regular arithmetic , occurs ) . So - called chunk de - composition [ CD ] problems require relaxing functional or operator constraints ( also at odds with arithmetic rules ) . Specifically , in DeCaro et al . ( 2016 ) either V had to be transformed into X or vice versa ( e . g . , V—I (cid:3) IX ¡ X—I (cid:3) IX ) . So - called constraint relaxation [ CR ] problems require ignoring the constraint pertain - ing to the entire structure of equation , assuming that only one equal sign is allowed per equation ( as imposed by regular arithmetic ) . Specifically , in DeCaro et al . another equal sign had to be intro - duced ( e . g . , III (cid:2) III (cid:3) III ¡ III (cid:3) III (cid:3) III ) . Crucially , DeCaro et al . ( Experiment 1 ) reported a marginally significant negative effect of WMC on the scores on two CR problems ( odds ratio (cid:3) . 949 ) ; however , no significant effect was found for two CD prob - lems . Moreover , DeCaro et al . ’s Experiment 2 yielded a marginally significant negative regression weight ( (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) . 189 ) between WMC and the score on three classical insight problems ( see subsequent text ) , once the incremental ( noninsight ) problem solv - ing accuracy was entered into the regression model . DeCaro et al . claimed to find conditions “when higher working memory capacity hinders insight” ( see also Van Stockum , Jr . & DeCaro , 2014 ) . In our view , these results are highly problematic , as they conflict with the dominant view on the structure of cognitive abilities , which predicts a substantial “positive manifold” among virtually all types of cognitive activity ( Carroll , 1993 ) . More specifically , a lot of evidence shows that reasoning ( strongly correlated with WMC ) and creativity correlate positively ( see Jauk , Benedek , Dunst , & Neubauer , 2013 ; Preckel , Holling , & Wiese , 2006 ) . So , expecting a positive link between WMC and insight constitutes a strong prior rather than vice versa . One needs really univocal evidence to overcome such a prior , and to claim the opposite . With only marginal effects reported ( p (cid:3) . 049 and p (cid:3) . 045 , for Experiments 1 and 2 , respectively ) , DeCaro et al . ( 2016 ) definitely did not provide such evidence . Moreover , their results might be rooted in the questionable methodology of their study . First , in Experiment 1 , the WMC measurement consisted of a single WM task ( the reading span task ) , and thus might not only have reflected the true WMC , potentially related to insight prob - lem solving , but also some peculiarities of the task itself ( verbal material , dual tasking ) , possibly unrelated to insight problem solv - ing . Although in Experiment 2 DeCaro et al . used two WM tasks ( the reading and the operation span ) , still both of them required solely verbal material . Second , DeCaro did not instruct their participants to think flexibly and creatively , which is a typical situation in studies on divergent thinking tests ; rather , they just required the correct solutions to problems ( a typical instruction in studies on insight problem solving ) . As such a vague instruction insisted on unde - fined correctness , some high - WMC participants might have reached solutions to the CR problems given to them , but they might have rejected them , thinking that such solutions were not expected by the experimenter , or allowed for in the task . Such a situation would be similar to giving a processing speed test to people without instructing them to respond quickly . Third , DeCaro et al . used only two CR items directly one after another , and participants who solved the former item , knew the solution to the latter one ( as indicated by Cronbach’s (cid:6) (cid:3) 1 . 0 ) . So , in fact , the single CR item ( of satisfactory validity , but unknown reliability ) was regressed on the single WMC measure ( of satis - factory reliability , but imperfect validity ) . More variability in responses was observed in Experiment 2 , but still only three problems were used , what might have resulted in the distribution of insight problem solving composite score that deviated from the normal distribution ( unfortunately , descriptive statistics were pro - vided only for single problems , not for the composite ) . Forth , the solution rate for the CR problems was very low ( they were solved by as few as 13 . 1 % of the participants ) . Thus , the weak WMC effect observed might have occurred because of a chance : in the group of 11 solvers the standard error of the mean WMC must have been much larger than for 73 nonsolvers . So , even two or three people who solved the CR problems regardless of low WMC might have caused this effect ( thus , its replication in another study would be unlikely ) . Apart from these methodological problems , DeCaro et al . ’s negative effects of WMC on insight problem solving were simply very weak : Nagelkerke’s R 2 of . 086 , reported in Experiment 1 , is in principle an artificially inflated measure ( see Menard , 2000 ) , and in Experiment 2 the standard R 2 was only . 035 . Solely for this reason , their study should be replicated before the problem solving community adopts the conclusion that WMC hinders insight . Thus , our goal was to examine the correlations between WMC and both the matchstick and classical insight problems either by directly applying the DeCaro et al . procedure ( Experiment 2A ) or using a modified methodology ( Experiments 1 and 2B ) . To foretell the results , in all three experiments we found a moderate positive T h i s do c u m e n t i s c opy r i gh t e d by t h e A m e r i ca n P s y c ho l og i ca l A ss o c i a ti on o r on e o f it s a lli e d pub li s h e r s .

Experiment 1 In this experiment we aimed to analyze the correlation between WMC and the matchstick as well as the verbal insight problems , by applying four methodological modifications to the original DeCaro et al . procedure : ( 1 ) using more problems per person ( and in effect receiving more normally distributed dependent variables ) , ( 2 ) using two conceptually different WM tasks , including one with the figural material , ( 3 ) explicitly emphasizing flexible and non - standard thinking to our participants , and ( 4 ) giving them no feedback on the solution accuracy . We also ( 5 ) measured analyt - ical reasoning . Participants Volunteer participants were recruited via publicly accessible social networking websites ( the maximum age was limited to 40 ) . Participants were informed that they would have to complete several tests , and the precise goal of the study was not revealed to them . Each participant gave informed consent and was paid the equivalent of € 10 in Polish zloty . A total of 70 women and 34 men participated ( 104 people ) . The mean age was 24 . 33 years ( SD (cid:3) 5 . 76 , range (cid:3) 18 – 40 ) . All participants had normal or corrected - to - normal vision . Materials Matchstick problems . The test included 12 matchstick state - ments printed on two sides of a single sheet of paper . The items belonged to the three categories used by DeCaro et al . ’s , but each category had a doubled number of items ( four ) . The ST problems were meant to involve primarily incremental operations . Two ST items required taking a matchstick from one numeral , and moving it to another numeral ( as in Knoblich et al . , 1999 ; and DeCaro et al . , 2016 ) . Two newly designed items required either taking a matchstick from the plus sign ( turning it into the minus sign ) and moving it to a numeral , or taking a matchstick from a numeral and turning the minus sign into the plus sign ( so they relaxed both the value and the operator constraint ) . Out of four CD items , two were of the type used by DeCaro et al . ( and Knoblich et al . ) , and required either moving one slanted matchstick in X in order to turn it into V , or turning V into X . Two new CD items required decomposing the operators : one matchstick had to be moved from the equal sign ( turning it into the minus sign ) to the minus sign ( and turning it into the equal sign ) . Finally , the four CR items were intended to involve the largest amount of restructuring . Two cor - responded to items originally used by DeCaro et al . ( and Knoblich et al . ) : One item required introducing a tautology by turning the plus sign into the second equal sign ( by rotating a matchstick ) , and one required doing the same by using a matchstick from a numeral . Two newly designed items required eliminating the numeral I from the equation to construct a tautology with one equal sign ( e . g . , turning I – I (cid:3) I into – I (cid:3) – I or , alternatively , turning the former into (cid:2) I (cid:3) I ) . The task instruction stressed that a single existing matchstick can be moved ( no matchsticks can be added or elimi - nated ) , but there are no other task constraints and participants should think in a flexible and nonstandard way . Answering con - sisted of writing down a correct Roman algebraic equation . Im - portantly , items from each pair ( i . e . , DeCaro et al . ’s original ST / CD / CD pairs , and the ST / CD / CD pairs introduced by us ) were printed on the opposite sides of the paper sheet , so one could not see directly the analogy between two items belonging to one pair . See Table 1 for a list of matchstick problems . Participants were given 12 min to solve all 12 problems . Classical insight problem test . Two problems ( i . e . , lilies , socks ) were the same as in DeCaro et al . ( we restricted insight problems to verbal ones , and thus did not use the triangle prob - lem ) . Six other problems , previously used in insight problem solving studies ( see Frederick , 2005 ; Weisberg , 1995 ) , were also applied . As some problems have already been popularized in the media , the specific contents of some problems was changed , whereas their internal structure was left intact . Descriptions of the problems ( see Table 2 ) were printed on one paper sheet . Their solutions were to be written down directly below the problems . Again , the task instruction insisted on flexible and nonstandard thinking . The number of correctly solved problems in 4 min represented the score on this test . Working memory tasks . The letter complex span task ( hence - forth , the letter span ) required participants to memorize a sequence of three to seven ( i . e . , set size ) consonants ( Chuderski , 2014b ) .

Each stimulus was followed by a decision task of checking with one of two arrow keys ( ¢ or ¡ ) if a simple algebraic equation ( e . g . , 2 (cid:7) 2 (cid:2) 3 (cid:3) 7 or 3 (cid:7) 2 – 1 (cid:3) 4 ) is correct or not ( respectively ) , presented until a response is given or for a maximum of 9 s . After two 2 - stimuli training trials , three trials for each set size ( in increasing order ) were presented . Response options were as many 3 (cid:7) 3 matrices as was a particular set size . Each matrix contained the same set of all nine possible stimuli . A participant was required to point with the mouse at those stimuli that had been presented in a sequence , in the correct order ( unlike in DeCaro et al . , items recalled in a wrong order were taken as errors ) . There was no time limit for responding . The dependent variable for the letter span task was the proportion of correctly pointed out stimuli to all 75 stimuli presented in the task . Each of the 96 trials of the figural change - detection task ( see Cowan , 2001 ) consisted of a pattern of either five or six stimuli , selected from 18 available figures . Each trial began with the presentation of a fixation point at the center of the screen . Then , the source array was presented for 2 s , followed by a mask of the same size as the array , presented for 0 . 8 s . Finally , in random order , either a target array was presented that was identical to the source , or exactly one item at one position differed from the source . If both arrays differed / were the same , a new / random ex - isting item was highlighted . Pressing one of two response keys was required , depending on whether the highlighted item differed or not . The target array was shown for 2 s . A response time window started at the target array presentation and ended when a partici - pant responded or after 8 s had elapsed . The trials were self - paced . The score on the task was the proportion of correct responses . Fluid reasoning tests . We also applied two tests of fluid reasoning on figural material , commonly acknowledged to be a hallmark example of analytical ( systematic , relational ) thinking ( Holyoak , 2012 ) . The Raven Advanced Progressive Matrices ( Ra - ven , Court , & Raven , 1983 ) consists of items that include a three - by - three matrix of figural patterns that is missing the bottom - right pattern , and eight response options , which are the patterns that can potentially match a missing one . The participant’s task was to discover the rules that govern the distribution of patterns and to apply them to the response options to choose the one and only right pattern . Each analogy of the Figural Analogy Test ( Chuderski & Ne˛cka , 2012 ) has the form of A is to B as C is to X , where A , B , and C are relatively simple patterns of figures , A is related to B according to two , three , four , or five rules ( e . g . , symmetry , rotation , change in size , color , thickness , number of objects , etc . ) , and X is an empty space . The task was to choose one figure , from a choice of four , which relates to Figure C as B relates to A . In each test , we used 18 odd - numbered items out of 36 original items , printed on several sheets of paper . Responses for each test were recorded on an answer form . The total number of correctly answered items , in 20 / 12 min , represented the score on Raven and Analogies . Procedure The session lasted about 2 hr . To maximize the correlation strength between tasks ( i . e . , decrease the procedure - specific vari - ance ) , the tasks were applied in a fixed order as follows : insight problems , matchstick problems , Raven , Analogies , change detec - tion , letter span . The participants were tested in a psychological laboratory in groups of six people on average . Sample Size and Missing Data For a desired sample size calculation , we assumed that the expected size of WMC - insight problem - solving correlation would be similar to a correlation ( r (cid:3) . 44 ) between WMC and verbal and figural classical insight problems reported previously by one of us ( Chuderski , 2014a ) . The G (cid:2) Power 3 . 1 software ( Faul , Erdfelder , Lang , & Buchner , 2007 ) estimated that to observe such a correla - tion with the (cid:6) level equal to . 05 , and the 1 – (cid:4) level ( power ) equal to . 95 , the required sample size must be at least 50 people . However , although in this initial sample the correlation between WMC and classical insight problems was as expected ( r (cid:3) . 42 , p (cid:3) . 005 ) , the analogous effect for the CR problems was not ( r (cid:3) . 12 , p (cid:3) . 439 ; see also our note on missing data below ) , suggesting Table 2 Insight Problems Applied in Experiment 1 Problem name Problem description Correctsolution Implicated incorrect solution Accuracy Lilies A forest fire doubles in area every 24 hr .

As there were no previous reports on the size of this effect ( except for DeCaro et al . ’s results , which we did not trust ) , we simply doubled the initial sample size . The final sample counted 104 people , which allowed us to observe effect sizes of r (cid:3) . 32 with power of 0 . 95 , or effect sizes of r (cid:3) . 25 with power decreased to 0 . 8 ( still , an acceptable value ) . Because of an experimenter’s error , one group of participants ( seven people ) in the first sample ( plus one person from the second sample ) was not given the matchstick problems . Thus , the sample for all analyses regarding matchsticks is 96 people . Also , in both subsamples , due to an equipment malfunction , three people did not complete the change detection task , and another five people failed to complete the letter span task . Thus , for eight people we had only one measure of WMC . No other data were missing . No multivar - iate outliers were identified . Results Accuracy for classical insight problems varied from M (cid:3) . 77 for the seven sisters problem to M (cid:3) . 18 for the socks problem . As all problems except the former one yielded accuracy of M (cid:3) . 30 or lower , for the sake of consistency we excluded this problem as too easy ( however , including it did not change significantly the re - sults ) . Mean accuracy of 36 % for the two original CR problems was higher than the 13 % in DeCaro et al . ( 2016 ) . Two newly designed CR problems were more difficult ( M (cid:3) . 19 ) than those original problems . Table 3 presents descriptive statistics for all measures . Although two measures ( the ST and CR problems ) deviated from the normal distribution , their regression residuals did not deviate from this distribution , so for all measures we calculated the Pearson correlation ( note that two substantially more robust sta - tistics , Spearman’s rho and Kendall’s tau gave basically the same results ) . The pattern of correlations is presented in Table 4 . Be - sides single scores in WM and reasoning tests , we also used the WMC composite ( the mean of z scores in the change detection and the letter span task ) , and the reasoning composite ( the mean of z scores in Raven and Analogies ) . For people with a missing WM task , we used their z score in the other WM task as a proxy of the WMC composite . Also , as suggested by an anonymous reviewer , in Table 4 we present data for the subsample of participants who completed all the tasks . The results were straightforward . All measures significantly and positively correlated , except for the ST problems ( most probably due to their ceiling effect ) . Specifically , the correlation between the four CR problems and WMC was r (cid:3) . 302 ( 95 % CI (cid:3) [ . 108 , . 474 ] ) . For two original CR problems ( 22 people solved one such problem , whereas 24 people solved both problems ) , r was . 318 ( 95 % CI (cid:3) [ . 126 , . 487 ] ) . For two new problems ( 16 people solved one such problem , whereas 9 people solved both problems ) , r was . 232 ( 95 % CI (cid:3) [ . 033 , . 431 ] ) . As an alternative measure of the WMC effect size for the original / new CR problems , we compared also the value of the WMC composite score of the participants who solved at least one such problem , with the WMC composite score value of people who solved no such problem . The WMC compos - ite of solvers of at least one original CR item surpassed the WMC of nonsolvers by (cid:8) M (cid:3) 0 . 50 SD ( p (cid:9) . 001 ) . An analogous WMC effect size for the newly designed CR items was (cid:8) M (cid:3) 0 . 36 SD ( p (cid:3) . 027 ) . The WMC correlation for the seven insight problems was r (cid:3) . 363 ( 95 % CI (cid:3) [ . 175 , . 525 ] ) . Figure 1 presents scatter plots illustrating the relationship between the WMC composite and the CR problems ( Panel A ) , as well as its relationship with the insight problems ( Panel C ) . Correlations with the reasoning factor were even stronger ( all r s (cid:10) . 45 ) . Discussion Experiment 1 brought clear evidence that WM facilitates insight problem solving , instead of hindering it . However , the difference between our main finding and the DeCaro et al . outcome does not seem to depend on our use of more WM tasks , including the figural one , as the positive links with insight problem solving were ob - served even for single WM tasks . This difference might be rooted either in our use of the “think nonstandard” instruction , or in our improvement of distributions of the CR matchstick and the verbal problems variables ( i . e . , in going beyond the logistic regression ) . The change in feedback , which was present in the DeCaro et al . procedure , but was absent in the present study , is unlikely to have mattered . However , one could potentially attribute this different outcome to some artifacts supposedly induced by the procedural differences we applied . Specifically , two reviewers of Experiment 1 sug - gested , among other issues , that our use of multiple insight prob - lems ( linked to potential learning favoring high - WMC people ) , our “think nonstandard” instructions ( constituting a potential cue to be Table 3 Descriptive Statistics for Measures Used in Experiment 1 Variable M SD Range Skew Kurtosis Standard type matchstick problems . 825 . 227 0 – 1 (cid:5) 1 . 33 1 . 45 Chunk decomposition matchstick problems . 516 . 330 0 – 1 (cid:5) . 01 (cid:5) 1 . 08 Constraint relaxation matchstick problems . 271 . 317 0 – 1 1 . 00 (cid:5) . 10 Insight problems . 269 . 276 0 – 1 . 94 . 12 Reading span task . 722 . 181 . 120 – 1 (cid:5) . 91 1 . 24 Figural change detection task . 741 . 093 . 467 – . 935 (cid:5) . 72 . 24 Raven . 655 . 179 . 111 – 1 (cid:5) . 64 . 18 Figural analogies . 625 . 178 . 111 – 1 (cid:5) . 21 (cid:5) . 08 Note .

Experiments 2A and 2B To exclude this latter possibility and to show the robustness of the positive links we observed , we reran DeCaro et al . ’s Experi - ments 1 and 2 ( our Experiment 2A ) , precisely following their original testing procedure , with only two exceptions : ( 1 ) the in - structions and items were carefully translated into Polish , and ( 2 ) the Experiment 2 procedure was applied to the same group who fulfilled the Experiment 1 procedure ( the order of procedures was random ; we assumed that any transfer effects between them would be negligible due to the substantial differences between the match - stick and verbal insight problems ) . We used solely the complex span tasks to measure WM , but to increase the measurement reliability we used three tasks ( including one figural ) . Contrary to the data reported by DeCaro et al . , we expected positive links between WMC and insight problems , which would match the results of our Experiment 1 . Moreover , to test whether the size of the positive effect of WMC on insight problem solving depends on the procedural details , directly after Experiment 2A we administered to the same sample Experiment 2B , in which the same numbers of matchstick ( 4 ST , 2 CD , and 2 CR ) , incremental ( 3 ) , and insight problems ( 3 ) were used as in Experiment 2A . However , the problems ( 1 ) had differ - ent content , ( 2 ) were presented altogether ( instead of problem after problem ) , ( 3 ) included no feedback for participants who , obvi - ously , this time ( 4 ) had been pre - exposed to analogous problems presented in Experiment 2A ( so transfer effects might have arisen ) . We expected that regardless of all those differences to Experiment 2A , the similar positive link between WMC and the CR and classical insight problems would show up also in Experiment 2B . If so , this would rule out the possibility that the outcome of Experiment 1 resulted from the details of the experimental proce - dure . Participants Volunteer participants were recruited via publicly accessible social networking websites . Like in DeCaro et al . ( 2016 ) , all of them were university students . The goal of the study was not revealed to the participants , who were just informed that they would have to complete several tests . Each participant gave in - formed consent and was paid the equivalent of € 7 in Polish zloty . A total of 61 women and 27 men participated ( 88 people ) . The mean age was 21 . 2 years ( SD (cid:3) 1 . 92 , range (cid:3) 18 – 25 ) . All participants had normal or corrected - to - normal vision . Materials for Experiment 2A Matchstick problems . The problems originally applied by DeCaro et al . ( for examples see their Figure 2 ) were divided into two sets administrated separately : one set consisted of four ST problems , the other set included two CR and two CD problems . Specifically , solving all four ST problems required taking just a single matchstick from one numeral , and moving it to another numeral . Solving both CR problems required changing the plus sign into the equal sign . One of the CD problems required chang - ing X into V , and the other required the opposite . Like in DeCaro et al . , the two problem sets were administrated separately , and participants were given 10 min to complete each set . Incremental and insight problems . Three insight ( socks , lil - ies , triangle ) and three incremental problems ( crime , cards , bach - elor ) , originally used by DeCaro et al . ( for problem descriptions , see their Table 1 ) , were presented in random order on the computer screen . Participants wrote down their solutions on a sheet of paper . Five minutes were given for each problem . Participants were asked to report ( by raising a hand ) when they thought they had found the correct answer . In such a case , the assistant checked the answer and , if it was incorrect , gave the feedback and asked the participant to continue working on the problem until the correct answer was found , or the time elapsed .

The test included two CR , two CD , and four ST matchstick problems ( eight in total ) , all intermixed on one sheet of paper ( for the list of problems , see Table 5 ) . The task instruction was the same as in Experiment 2A . Also , solving the problems required exactly the same operations that were required for solving the respective types of matchstick problems in Exper - iment 2A . There were two variants of the test with opposite orderings of items , and each participant was randomly given one of the variants . The administration time was 15 min . Incremental and insight problems . The test included three classical insight problems ( two strings , game of checkers , sheep in pens ; see Weisberg , 1995 ; the observed accuracy was M (cid:3) . 58 , M (cid:3) . 42 , and M (cid:3) . 40 , respectively ) that are commonly used in studies on insight problems solving . Three incremental problems included a difficult item from the above mentioned Figural Anal - ogy Test ( accuracy was M (cid:3) . 53 ) , which required complex geo - metric transformations ( rotation , change in size , color , etc . ) , as well as two newly designed problems ( students , grandma ; accu - racy was M (cid:3) . 25 and M (cid:3) . 65 , respectively ) , which required complex algebraic computations ( of the number of students learn - ing a particular foreign language , as well as of the actual age of grandma ) , given the input data . All six problems were intermixed on one sheet of paper . Each participant was randomly given one out of two test variants that had the opposite orderings of prob - lems . The administration time was 30 min . In no problem within Experiment 2A and 2B did the instruction say that nonstandard , flexible thinking was required ( it just suggested to do one’s best to provide correct solutions to problems within the time limits and the task constraints ) . Working memory tasks . WMC of each participant was screened with three complex span tasks ( Chuderski , 2014b ) . The letter span task was identical to the one in Experiment 1 , except that five 4 - stimuli , five 6 - stimuli , and five 8 - stimuli Figure 1 .

The digit span task was identical to the letter span task , except that the stimuli were digits , and the decision task consisted of pressing the key ¢ if the five - letter string pre - sented after each stimulus started and ended with a consonant ( e . g . , KVTAR ) , or pressing the key ¡ if it started and ended with a vowel ( e . g . , ENYBA ) . The stimuli in the figure span task were figures ( square , triangle , circle , cross , trapezium , rhombus , etc . ) , and the decision task was to decide whether the color of a bar presented after each stimulus was light ( key ¢ ) or dark ( key ¡ ) . The dependent variable for each complex span task was the pro - portion of correctly pointed out stimuli to all 90 stimuli presented in the task . Procedure One session included both Experiment 2A and 2B , and lasted about 135 min . First , three blocks of Experiment 2A ( 4 ST match - stick problems , 2 CD (cid:2) 2 CR problems , and 3 insight (cid:2) 3 incremental problems ) were applied in a random order . Then , two blocks of Experiment 2B ( 8 matchstick problems , and 3 insight (cid:2) 3 incremental problems ) were also applied in a random order . Finally , participants completed the three complex span tasks in the fixed order ( figure span , letter span , digit span ) . Groups of around four people were tested in the psychological laboratory . Sample Size and Missing Data The size of our sample ( 88 people ) was set to correspond to the sample of DeCaro et al . ’s Experiment 1 ( 84 people ) . No data were missing , except for one score on the digit complex span task of one person , which was substituted by the mean of scores on the two remaining complex span tasks for that person . No multivariate outliers were identified . Results Descriptive statistics for all measures in Experiments 2A and 2B are shown in Table 6 . As in both Experiments substantial time was allowed for matchstick problems , the ST problems’ accuracy reached ceiling and yielded highly skewed distribution , so we skipped its analysis . The CD problems also yielded high accuracy , but below ceiling . Accuracy for the CR , incremental , and insight problems was comparable and oscillated around 50 % . The three complex span task scores were normally distributed . Using explor - atory factor analysis , we extracted from them the WMC factor ( Eigenvalue (cid:3) 2 . 10 , 70 . 0 % total variance explained , for their loadings on the WMC factor see Table 7 ) . First , for data from Experiment 2A we ran the same types of analyses as applied by DeCaro et al . Regarding the matchstick problems and probably because of the blocked presentation format , among people who solved correctly the CR problems , 32 people Table 5 Matchstick Problems Applied in Experiment 2B Category Description Correct solution ( s ) Accuracy ST X (cid:3) VII (cid:2) V XI (cid:3) VI (cid:2) V . 94 CR VI (cid:2) VI (cid:3) VI VI (cid:3) VI (cid:3) VI . 45 ST IV (cid:2) II (cid:3) VIII VI (cid:2) II (cid:3) VIII . 97 CD V (cid:3) XI – I X (cid:3) XI – I . 88 ST IX (cid:3) III (cid:2) IV IX (cid:3) III (cid:2) VI . 90 CR II – III (cid:3) II II (cid:3) II (cid:3) II . 49 ST V (cid:3) IV – I V (cid:3) VI – I or IV (cid:3) V – I . 97 CD IV (cid:3) V (cid:2) IV IX (cid:3) V (cid:2) IV . 88 Note .

In conse - quence , and similarly to DeCaro et al . , we had to use the logistic regression to test whether WMC predicts the likelihood of solving at least one versus none of the CR problems . The resulting odds ratio equaled 1 . 984 and significantly ( Wald (cid:3) 6 . 85 , p (cid:3) . 009 ) favored higher WMC . A similar result ( odds ratio (cid:3) 1 . 875 , Wald (cid:3) 4 . 55 , p (cid:3) . 033 ) was observed for the CD problems , which were solved by the majority ( 73 ) of people ( of whom 65 solved both problems ) . As the alternative correlation statistics as well as the measure of effect size , we also computed Kendall’s tau ( (cid:11) ) for WMC and the number of correctly solved CR problems ( (cid:11) (cid:3) . 252 , p (cid:9) . 05 ) as well as the CD problems ( (cid:11) (cid:3) . 164 , p (cid:9) . 05 ) . The WMC factor of people who solved at least one CR problem was significantly larger by (cid:8) M (cid:3) 0 . 60 SD than the WMC factor of people who failed to solve both CR problems ( for the CD prob - lems , (cid:8) M (cid:3) 0 . 63 SD ) . Second , we ran the same analyses using data from Experiment 2B . The CR problems designed by us were slightly easier than the DeCaro problems ( out of 88 participants , 11 people solved one problem , and 36 people solved both problems ) , or the learning / transfer effect occurred . Again , the results of the logistic regres - sion favored higher WMC ( odds ratio (cid:3) 2 . 075 , Wald (cid:3) 8 . 07 , p (cid:3) . 004 ) . Regarding the CD problems , the near ceiling effect was faced , as only 8 people solved no problem , and 6 succeeded on one problem . Not surprisingly , then , the WMC effect was not signif - icant ( odds ratio (cid:3) 1 . 368 , Wald (cid:3) 0 . 76 , p (cid:3) . 384 ) . Kendall’s tau suggested that the observed effects are moderate for the CR problems ( (cid:11) (cid:3) . 251 , p (cid:9) . 05 ) , but negligible for the CD ones ( (cid:11) (cid:3) . 087 , p (cid:10) . 05 ) . The WMC factor of solvers of at least one CR problem significantly exceeded by (cid:8) M (cid:3) 0 . 64 SD the WMC factor of nonsolvers ( for the CD problems , (cid:8) M (cid:3) 0 . 32 SD , ns ) . Next , we repeated the DeCaro analyses pertaining to their in - cremental and insight problems ( Experiment 2A ) . We submitted to ANCOVA the ( dummy coded ) problem type as the within - subjects factor , the WMC factor and the WMC (cid:7) Problem Type product as the covariates , and the problem - solving accuracy as the dependent variable . Neither the problem type ( p (cid:3) . 393 ) , nor WMC ( p (cid:3) . 366 ) or their product ( p (cid:3) . 526 ) yielded a significant effect . The latter variable seemed redundant and simply mirrored information carried by the WMC factor , as removing it from the model resulted in a strong effect of WMC , F ( 1 , 173 ) (cid:3) 22 . 88 , p (cid:9) . 001 , (cid:12) 2 (cid:3) . 117 . These results were matched by the linear regression analysis , with the insight problem accuracy significantly predicted by both the WMC factor ( (cid:4) (cid:3) . 364 , p (cid:9) . 001 ) and by the incremental problem - solving accuracy ( (cid:4) (cid:3) . 637 , p (cid:9) . 001 ) , when each was entered separately in the model ( both predictors correlated at . 318 , p (cid:3) . 003 ) , as well as when they were added in parallel ( (cid:4) (cid:3) . 179 , p (cid:3) . 040 and (cid:4) (cid:3) . 580 , p (cid:9) . 001 , respectively ) . Analogous results were observed when data from Experiment 2B were analyzed . No significant effect was observed when the three variables ( problem type , WMC , and their product ) were submitted to the analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) , but the WMC factor became significant in the two - variable model , F ( 1 , 173 ) (cid:3) 8 . 06 , p (cid:3) . 005 , (cid:12) 2 (cid:3) . 045 . In the linear regression model , the insight problem accuracy was significantly predicted separately by the incremental problem solving accuracy ( (cid:4) (cid:3) . 253 , p (cid:3) . 017 ) , but for WMC there was only a weak trend ( (cid:4) (cid:3) . 165 , p (cid:3) . 123 ) . However , the latter link became significant when Kendall’s statis - tic was used ( (cid:11) (cid:3) . 155 , p (cid:9) . 05 ) , which seemed to be a more suitable effect estimator , given the fact that the insight problem accuracy came from only three items . Finally , we analyzed the mean accuracy in consecutive problem types by combining items from both Experiment 2A and 2B . As doubling the number of items per problem type yielded nice normal distributions for the CR , incremental , and insight problem accuracy , we could calculate the Pearson correlations among all the variables ( see Table 7 ; note that although the ST and CD problem distributions still deviated from normality because of substantial ceiling effects , for the sake of completeness we in - cluded them as well ) . Most importantly , the WMC factor corre - lated with each class of problems positively and significantly , with the CD matchstick problems at r (cid:3) . 245 ( 95 % CI (cid:3) [ . 037 , . 432 ] ) , with the CR matchstick problems at r (cid:3) . 334 ( 95 % CI (cid:3) [ . 134 , . 508 ] ) , and with the insight problems at r (cid:3) . 317 ( 95 % CI (cid:3) [ . 115 , . 494 ] ) . Figure 1 presents the scatter plots of the relationship between the WMC factor and the CR problems ( Panel B ) as well as the WMC factor and the insight problems ( Panel D ) . Notably , these correlations were significant ( at least marginally ) not only for the WMC factor , but also for single complex span tasks . General Discussion Our three studies demonstrated the robust positive effect of WMC on the CD and CR problems as well as on the verbal insight problems . For each type of problem , effect sizes accounted for 10 % of the variance explained by WMC , no matter what problems were used or how they were applied .

Substantial correla - tions with insight problem solving were also present for analytic reasoning . It seems that our initial doubts about the impact of DeCaro et al . study’s methodology ( i . e . , the use of few problems / tasks and vague instructions ) on the negative WMC - insight correlation were un - warranted . Their own methodology , when applied by us in a direct way , also yielded highly reliable positive effects of WMC on the matchstick problems as well as the insight problems . Although our use of the WMC composite / factor extracted from the two and three WM tasks ( including one figural task ) in Experiments 1 and 2 , respectively , boosted its correlation with the insight problem solv - ing a little bit , in comparison to single WM tasks , even the latter effects were pretty robust . It did not matter , either , whether the insight problem instructions promoted creative thinking or not . In general , the present study contributed to the methodology of re - search on insight problem solving . By applying in the three Ex - periments ( 1 , 2A , and 2B ) the three different procedures for the matchstick and classical problems administration , we were able to demonstrate that the procedural details ( e . g . , the number , contents , ordering , instructions , and feedback pertaining to the problems ) did not seem to matter for the relationship between WMC and insight problem solving , as very similar effect sizes ( r s around . 3 ) were observed for both the CR and classical insight problems across the three studies . So , why did DeCaro et al . observe the marginally negative correlation between WMC and insight problem solving ? In light of our data , as well as after looking more deeply into DeCaro et al . ’s data , we think that their virtually null effect of WMC might have resulted from the relatively low problem - solving performance of their participants , which interacted with the use of too few insight items . Regarding the matchstick problems , what does it mean that 13 . 1 % of the 84 people sample scored 100 % accuracy on the two CR problems ( whereas 86 . 9 % participants scored zero ) ? It means that exactly 11 people got it right , and 73 people did not . The former sample is so small that two or three low - WMC people , who incidentally solved the CR problems ( e . g . , because they knew those or similar problems and did not admit that fact , or had in the past trained creative thinking , or just came upon the solution by chance , etc . ) , might have tipped the scale . Closer inspection of DeCaro et al . ’s Figure 3 , with around 20 % problem - solving accu - racy for the participants with one standard deviation below the mean WMC score and 10 % for the people with one standard deviation above it , suggests that about 5 people from the lowest tercile in WMC and 2 to 3 people from the highest tercile solved the CR problems . Any effects found for groups of so small a number must be extremely unreliable . Also , the 54 . 8 % accuracy on the three classical insight problems used by DeCaro et al . means that 184 insight problems were solved in total . A closer inspection of their Figure 4 , showing around 10 % difference in problem - solving accuracy between the participants one standard deviation below versus one standard deviation above the mean WMC factor , suggests that the 37 people from the lowest WMC tercile en masse solved just several insight problems more than the 37 people from the highest tercile . Again , such a small number of additional problems in the former tercile might have been solved incidentally . In contrast , in our Experiment 2A and 2B ( combined ) , in the lowest tercile of the WMC factor there were 12 solvers of the CR problems , whereas 22 such solvers were in the highest tercile . The lowest tercile solved 61 insight problems , whereas the highest tercile solved 107 such problems . In this perspective , our effect sizes are at least five times larger than those found in DeCaro et al . Why should we observe positive links between WMC and insight problem solving ? There can be several levels at which WM may play an important role . First , recent theorizing about creative problem solving has proposed that a substantial role is being played by problem solving stages that involve analytic thinking ( see Fleck & Weisberg , 2013 ; Jones , 2003 ; Weisberg , 2015 ) . Such stages may either constitute prerequisites for insight ( one may need to explore all possible heuristics , even the most complex ones , to realize that a completely different method of coping with a problem is necessary ) , or even directly lead to the creative solution ( that is , with no insight ) . Weisberg ( 2015 ) , on the basis of historical protocols of known discoveries and inventions as well as several laboratory studies , listed a number of analytical cognitive processes that can take part in insight problem solving . We know that WM strongly predicts the effectiveness of those processes , which include selective access to long - term memory ( see Un - sworth & Engle , 2007 ) , binding together remote pieces of infor - mation ( see Oberauer , Süß , Wilhelm , & Sander , 2007 ) , analogical mapping of two knowledge structures ( see Holyoak , 2012 ) , mental visualization ( see Miyake , Friedman , Rettinger , Shah , & Hegarty , 2001 ) , and many more . In a similar vein , one of us ( Chuderski , 2014a ) has recently proposed that specialized processes facilitating insight , even if they were relatively independent from WM , con - stitute only some “add - ons” that supplement the complex machin - ery of the regular , WM - dependent analytical thinking required to cope with insight problems . In consequence , the positive correla - tion between problem - solving accuracy and WMC might have occurred due to the potentially substantial analytical component involved in solving our CR matchstick and classical problems . The second possibility assumes the interindividual differences in the sensation of insight , with some people tending to experience “pure” insights when coping with nontrivial problems , whereas others primarily rely on analytical ( systematical , formal , etc . ) methods and strategies ( the possibility implicated by data of Fleck & Weisberg , 2013 ) . Thus , even if the problem solving accuracy of some participants might not depend on WM , the substantial pro - portion of the sample whose accuracy did depend on WM might have caused the positive correlation to arise . Finally , high WMC may reflect general neurocognitive advan - tage over low WMC ( e . g . , a more reliable maintenance of mental representations , or more effective brain connectivity ; see Colom , Chuderski , & Santarnecchi , 2016 ) , which may help in insight problem solving . Although a relatively simple correlational study , like the present one , is not able to discriminate between the three cases ( or their combination ) , our moderate positive correlations between WMC and performance on the problems , which were commonly interpreted by the proponents of the special - process accounts as often involving insight ( e . g . , for the two strings prob - lem , see Maier , 1930 ; for the triangle problem , see Metcalfe & Wiebe , 1987 ; for the original CR problems see Knoblich et al . , 1999 ) , suggest that the special - process accounts are not tenable ( at least in their radical form ; see Weisberg , 2015 ) . Simply put , if T h i s do c u m e n t i s c opy r i gh t e d by t h e A m e r i ca n P s y c ho l og i ca l A ss o c i a ti on o r on e o f it s a lli e d pub li s h e r s .

Summing up , in the three studies that we administered , there is no evidence for DeCaro et al . ’s claim that WM hinders insight . The opposite was observed : WM substantially facilitates insight . Theories in any discipline , including the psychology of creative problem solving , should be based on solid and reliable data , and this paper provides solid and reliable empirical evidence in favor of one such theory of insight problem solving ( the nothing - special account ) . It also demonstrates that the previously reported evi - dence , supposedly supporting an alternative theory ( the special - process account ) , is highly problematic , as it could not be repli - cated in the course of three our studies . Correcting DeCaro et al . claim seems important because publishing such “fancy” but un - warranted results may lead to the common ( as of February 18 , 2017 , their article already had seven citations , according to Google Scholar ) but false belief that in tasks that supposedly rely less on algorithmic processing , the people with less effective cognition are more creative . No , they are less creative . References Ash , I . K . , & Wiley , J . ( 2006 ) . The nature of restructuring in insight : An individual - differences approach .
