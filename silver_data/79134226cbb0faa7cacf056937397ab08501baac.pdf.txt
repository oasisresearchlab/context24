Recent experimental data on mammary carcinoma cells reveal that stimulation by epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) generates a pool of active coﬁlin that results in a peak of actin ﬁlament barbed ends on the timescale of 1 min . Here , we present results of a mathematical model for the dynamics of coﬁlin and its transition between several pools in response to EGF stimulation . We describe the interactions of phospholipase C , membrane lipids ( PIP 2 ) , and coﬁlin bound to PIP 2 and to F - actin , as well as diffusible coﬁlin in active G - actin - monomer - bound or phosphorylated states . We consider a simpliﬁed representation in which the thin cell edge ( lamellipod ) and the cell interior are represented by two compartments that are linked by diffusion . We demonstrate that a high basal level of active coﬁlin stored by binding to PIP 2 , as well as the highly enriched local milieu of F - actin at the cell edge , is essential to capture the EGF - induced barbed - end ampliﬁcation observed experimentally . INTRODUCTION Eukaryotic cell motility relies on polymerization of F - actin to generate protrusive forces at the leading edge of the cell . This polymerization requires available fast - growing barbed ends for actin monomer addition . Indeed , in response to stimulation by epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , a large peak of barbed ends is observed to form in mammary carcinoma cells ~ 1 min poststimulus . This peak has been found to be coﬁlin - dependent ( 1 ) . Local activation of coﬁlin has been shown to lead to protrusion initiation and to determine the cell direction ( 1 , 2 ) . Further , suppression of coﬁlin ( via knockdown ) in the same tumor cell type leads to cells with decreased protrusion velocity and chemotaxis ( 3 , 4 ) . Nucleation of new barbed ends by Arp2 / 3 is well known , but a similar role for coﬁlin has recently become apparent ( 5 ) . Coﬁlin plays multiple roles , depending on conditions . These include disassembly and / or debranching of the actin dendritic network , as well as de novo F - actin nucleation ( 6 – 9 ) . Here , we are concerned only with the role of coﬁlin in generating the ﬁrst peak of barbed ends created down - stream of EGF stimulation ( 10 ) . Coﬁlin has several states inside the cell . It can bind to F - or G - actin ( preferring ADP - rather than ATP - actin ( 7 , 11 ) ) ; it has freely diffusing dephosphorylated ( active ) and phosphorylated ( inactive ) forms ( 12 , 13 ) . In resting carcinoma cells , van Rheenen et al . ( 14 ) found that there is a pool of coﬁlin bound to the phosphoinositide phospha - tidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) , and hence inactive ( 15 ) , at the cell membrane . Although both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated coﬁlin can bind to PIP 2 ( 16 ) , only dephosphorylated coﬁlin was found to be enriched in the plasma membrane ( 17 ) . Upon EGF stimulation , phospholipase - C ( PLC ) is activated and hydrolyzes PIP 2 ( into inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol ) , so that PIP 2 falls to 40 – 60 % of its basal level ( 1 , 14 ) . Active coﬁlin ( no longer taken up as rapidly by PIP 2 ) becomes available in the cytoplasmic region adjoining the membrane . Our hypothesis is that this effective ﬂux , together with the high local density of cytoskeleton leads to the rapid barbed - end peak . After severing F - actin , coﬁlin carries an actin monomer and has to be recharged . Phosphorylation by LIM kinase ( LIMK ) releases coﬁlin’s bound G - actin , and dephosphorylation by slingshot phosphatase ( SSH ) allows coﬁlin to rebind to PIP 2 , completing its cycle . It has been suggested that a single coﬁlin protein can interact with one or more PIP 2 molecules ( 18 ) . Thus , the twofold PIP 2 drop would be consistent with a similar drop of PIP 2 - coﬁlin or a twofold increase of active coﬁlin . And yet , the peak of barbed ends is 10 - to 15 - fold higher than its basal level . This leads to our main question of what creates the observed barbed - end ampliﬁcation . In addition , we address the following questions : 1 . Can coﬁlin dynamics alone account for the large tran - sient pulse of actin ﬁlament barbed ends observed within 1 min of EGF stimulation of carcinoma cells ? How does this ampliﬁcation occur ? 2 . Based on experimental observations , what are the ﬂows of coﬁlin between the various pools described above ? 3 . How much coﬁlin is in the freely diffusing active form in the resting versus stimulated cell ? 4 . What are the effects of overexpressing or inhibiting the various agents that control the ﬂows of coﬁlin between compartments ?

MATHEMATICAL MODELS Barbed - end ampliﬁcation Our preliminary model addresses the large barbed - end ampliﬁcation . From here on , we deﬁne ampliﬁcation as the ratio of barbed - end peak amplitude to barbed - end steady - state level in the resting state ( B peak / B ss ) . Large ampliﬁcation implies a low basal level of severing and / or a large peak after stimulus . The rapid growth of barbed ends could result from 1 ) , de novo actin nucleation ; 2 ) , Arp2 / 3 mediated branching ; or 3 ) , severing of the ﬁlaments . Of these possible causes , we rejected the ﬁrst , since sponta - neous nucleation of ﬁlaments is slow ( 19 ) and limited by proﬁlin ( 20 ) . As for the second , experiments with PLC inhibitors and coﬁlin siRNA rule out Arp2 / 3 in the ﬁrst peak of barbed ends , and demonstrate its involvement in a later second peak ( 1 ) . This left the third hypothesis , which is explored further below . We considered an elementary model for active coﬁlin ( C ) and barbed ends ( B ) , with basal rates of production ( I B , I C ) ; coﬁlin inactivation , k p ; and barbed - end capping , k cap : dC dt ¼ I stim ð t Þ þ I C (cid:2) k p C (cid:2) F sev ð C Þ ; ( 1 ) dB dt ¼ I B (cid:2) k cap B þ AF sev ð C Þ : ( 2 ) ( A converts units of C ( m M ) to units of B ( number / m m 2 ) . ) We assumed that I stim ð t Þ ¼ 0 before stimulation , so there is very little severing activity . Poststimulus , I stim ð t Þ ¼ I 0 > 0 , and barbed ends are generated by severing F - actin . Nonlinear kinetics of severing We asked what type of severing kinetics , F sev ( C ) , could account for the observed high ampliﬁcation for B ( t ) and explored three possibilities : 1 ) , a linear function , 2 ) , a satu - rating function , and 3 ) , a Hill function far from saturation . Analysis of Eqs . 1 and 2 , shown in the Supporting Material , reveals that the coﬁlin dependence of the ﬁrst barbed - end peak requires severing kinetics to be nonlinear and oper - ating far from saturation , i . e . , the third possibility . We ascribe this nonlinearity to the cooperative nature of coﬁlin binding to F - actin ( 21 , 22 ) . This preliminary exploration informed our choice of the function F sev ( C ) in Eq . 2 . F sev ð C Þ ¼ k sev C rest (cid:1) C C rest (cid:3) n ; ( 3 ) where C rest is the concentration of coﬁlin in the resting state , n the degree of cooperativity ( 21 ) , and k sev a constant . Note that the form of Eq . 3 is equivalent to a Hill function commonly used in cooperative kinetics , but in a regime far from saturation . We asked whether the possible rounds of severing , F - actin polymerization , further severing , etc . , could also account for a similar autocatalytic effect . We rejected this possibility for several reasons . First , total F - actin only doubles on the time - scale of interest ( 23 ) , far short of the observed factor of 10 . Second , unlike Arp2 / 3 , coﬁlin preferentially binds to ADP or ADP - P i - F - actin ( 5 ) . This would lead to some delay in a further round of severing while ﬁlaments lose their phos - phate groups . Third , as older ﬁlaments recede from the cell edge , they are bound by tropomyosin and protected from further severing by coﬁlin ( 23 ) . This limits the ability of self - ampliﬁcation due to autocatalytic growth , leading us to reject such alternatives . Coﬁlin regulation model We now turn to more detailed models for the coﬁlin cycle in mammary carcinoma cells ( 1 , 14 , 17 ) . We consider only the events leading up to the ﬁrst peak of barbed ends post - EGF stimulation , constraining the model to match both basal levels of all intermediates ( before stimulation ) and the tran - sient after the stimulus . Well - measured intermediates such as PLC and PIP 2 are used as inputs , and the size , timing , and shape of the peak of barbed ends are used to appraise the model’s predictive ability . The model also predicts coﬁlin ﬂows between the various pools , both those observed exper - imentally , and those that are below experimental resolution . A ﬁrst attempt to model the coﬁlin cycle within a single spatial compartment failed to account for certain observa - tions ( see the Supporting Material ) . Here , we present the two - compartment model shown schematically in Fig . 1 ( see the Supporting Material for the original and the Appendix for scaled - model equations ) . The compartments correspond to a small region ( ~ 200 nm in width ( 23 ) ) of cell edge adjacent to the membrane , and the cell interior with volumes V E and V I ( see Fig . 1 enlarged in the Support - ing Material ) . A small cylindrical surface of height l forms the interface between these volumes , through which diffu - sion can take place , as explained in the Supporting Material . Activation of PLC ( denoted PLC ( t ) ) downstream of the EGF signal leads to hydrolysis of PIP 2 ( P 2 ( t ) ) . We track ﬁve co - ﬁlin forms : coﬁlin bound to F - actin ( C f ( t ) ) and to PIP 2 on the membrane ( C 2 ( t ) ) , both resident at the cell edge ; and diffus - ible forms of coﬁlin , i . e . , active ( C a ( t ) ) , actin - monomer - bound ( C m ( t ) ) , and inactive / phosphorylated ( C p ( t ) ) coﬁlin , which can exchange between compartments . C iE and C iI denote diffusible coﬁlin concentrations in the edge / interior compartments . Basic assumptions include Conservation . On the timescale of interest ( a few minutes ) , synthesis / degradation of coﬁlin is negligible , and the total amount of coﬁlin is roughly conserved . Thus , Biophysical Journal 100 ( 8 ) 1883 – 1892 1884 Tania et al .

Severing due to F - actin bound coﬁlin . We assume that coﬁlin must be bound to F - actin ( C F ) to sever it . We adopt F sev ¼ F sev ( C f ) from Eq . 3 . PIP 2 hydrolysis . The basal PIP 2 hydrolysis rate was based on PIP 2 FRET ( 14 ) : post - EGF stimulus , PIP 2 drops by 40 – 60 % , then recovers to 80 % of baseline within 360 s ( 14 ) . From this , we estimated the recovery rate at d p 2 ¼ log 2 / 360 ~ 0 . 002 / s . Binding and unbinding to F - actin . We based the unbinding rate , k off ¼ 0 . 005 / s , on in vitro data ( 7 ) . We assume that F - actin binding sites for coﬁlin are not limiting , so that k on F is approximately the constant representing the on - rate of coﬁlin binding to actin . Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation . We ﬁrst consider the case where rates of both phosphorylation ( k mp ) and dephosphorylation ( k pm ) are constant and similar for the two forms of coﬁlin , C a , and C m . Actin monomer binding . Although the transition between C p and C m is a two - step process , we assume that it is only limited by the phosphorylation and dephosphor - ylation rates . As a simpliﬁcation , G - actin binding / unbinding is assumed to be instantaneous and not limited by actin monomer availability . ( This is reason - able in view of the ample level of actin monomers in cells , but see ( 24 ) . ) Rebinding to PIP 2 . We assumed that poststimulus recovery of C 2 follows rebinding of phosphocoﬁlin to PIP 2 , making the conversion C pE / C 2 ( rate k p 2 ) . Flux between compartments . Because compartments are of vastly different sizes , our balance equations contain compartment volume factors to preserve mass con - servation ( Appendix and Supporting Material ) . We assume that the coﬁlin ﬂux between compartments is diffusive , and thus proportional to concentration gradients . To compare model predictions with experimental obser - vations , we also quantify barbed ends , B ( t ) , using Eq . 2 as before , with F sev ¼ F sev ( C F ) , and I B ¼ 0 . Scaling and parameter determination Because most experimental results quantify levels of vari - ables relative to their basal level , we scale the model accord - ingly . PLC , P 2 , and B are divided by their unstimulated steady - state values , and the coﬁlin forms by the total mean coﬁlin concentration in the cell , C tot . Original vari - ables are denoted in capital letters , and the corresponding scaled variables in lower - case letters ( see Appendix ) , so that c jE , c jI are , respectively , the edge and interior scaled concentrations of coﬁlin form j . We also deﬁne the com - partment volume fractions v E ¼ V E / ( V E þ V I ) and v I ¼ V I / ( V E þ V I ) , so that the conservation statement ( Eq . 4 ) becomes v E (cid:4) c 2 þ c Ea þ c f þ c Em þ c Ep (cid:5) þ v I (cid:4) c Ia þ c Im þ c Ip (cid:5) ¼ 1 ; ( 5 ) The total whole - cell fraction of coﬁlin in form j is then given by v E c jE þ v I c jI . We further denote the steady - state fractions as R 2 h V E V E þ V I C 2 C tot ¼ v E c 2 ; R f h V E V E þ V I C F C tot ¼ v E c f ; ( 6 ) R a h v E c Ea þ v I c Ia ; R p h v E c Ep þ v I c Ip ; R m h v E c Em þ v I c Im : Equations 5 and 6 then imply that R 2 þ R a þ R m þ R P þ R f ¼ 1 . Song et al . ( 17 ) found the fraction of phosphorylated coﬁlin before EGF stimulation ( R p ) to be 20 % . Van Rheenen et al . ( 14 ) observed that most of the coﬁlin residing at the edge is bound to either F - actin or to PIP 2 . They further showed that the ratio between the PIP 2 - and the F - actin - bound coﬁlin is 85 % : 15 % , so we similarly take R 2 / R f ¼ 0 . 85 / 0 . 15 . The fraction of PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin , R 2 , has not been determined experimentally . A lower estimate of 10 % EGF .

Cell geometry ( also see Supporting Material for enlarged view ) : interior compartment ( volume V I ) is approximated as a hemisphere of radius R z 5 – 10 m m .

Sche - matics of the coﬁlin regulation pathway of the ordinary - differential - equa - tion model . The PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin , C 2 , and the F - actin - bound form , C f , are restricted to the membrane edge compartment , whereas the other forms can diffuse between the two compartments ( gray dashed arrows ) . Other arrows in the ﬁgure represent reaction terms in the equations ( see Appendix and Supporting Material ) . Biophysical Journal 100 ( 8 ) 1883 – 1892 Coﬁlin Induces Barbed - End Generation 1885 has been measured ( R . Eddy and J . Condeelis , unpublished ) . The fraction of diffusible active coﬁlin , R a , is difﬁcult to measure experimentally . We used data ﬁtting to quantify both R a and R 2 . Finally , R m can be determined from the conservation condition . Parameter values ( Table 1 ) were obtained from the liter - ature by imposing steady - state constraints in Eq . 6 , and / or by ﬁtting the barbed - end proﬁle from Mouneimne et al . ( 3 ) ( see Fig . 3 ) and the time course of phosphocoﬁlin from Song et al . ( 17 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . All experimental data used for parameter ﬁtting are shown in Fig . 2 and details are dis - cussed in the Supporting Material . Parameter sensitivity analysis was done for parameters determined from data ﬁtting . Brieﬂy , we ﬁrst determined the 95 % conﬁdence level from bootstrapping : thus , if we were to choose a set of parameter values within the intervals , very similar results would be obtained . The results are listed in Table 1 . Second , we also performed an error analysis on a broad range of parameter values ( Fig . S5 in the Supporting Material ) and found a relatively narrow region of parameter values that yields a good agreement between model and data ( see Sup - porting Material for details ) . The most sensitive parameter is R 2 , the steady - state level of PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin . RESULTS Basic behavior We simulated the model using default parameter values ( Table 1 ) , with variables initialized at the resting / steady - state values ( Table S3 ) . EGF stimulation ( a pulse in I stim ) is turned on at 25 s , and off 60 s later . Parameters for the PLC equation are ﬁt to data in Mouneimne et al . ( 1 ) , and other parameters are found as described above ( and in the Supporting Material ) . The resulting parameter setting repre - sents a control cell . Dynamics of plc , p 2 , the fraction of total coﬁlin in each form ( v E c jE þ v I c jI ) , and barbed ends are shown in Fig . 2 ; concentrations within each compartment are shown in Fig . S9 . PLC dynamics ( Fig . 2 A , upper left ) closely match data from Mouneimne et al . ( 1 ) . The scaled PIP 2 ( p 2 ) , and PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin ( c 2 ) dynamics agree qual - itatively with observed behavior ( 14 ) . Parameter ﬁtting leads to a barbed - end time course , b ( t ) , that matches the experimentally observed ﬁrst peak ( 1 ) reasonably well . Barbed ends are ampliﬁed by an order of magnitude above the basal ( resting ) value . Only the ﬁrst barbed - end peak is captured , since this model does not consider Arp2 / 3 .

Biophysical Journal 100 ( 8 ) 1883 – 1892 1886 Tania et al . occurs , so that the peak is attained at ~ 90 s . The delay is consistent with a second experimental data set shown in Mouneimne et al . ( 1 ) , where little barbed - end production was observed within 30 s of EGF stimulation . The delay in the barbed - end peak stems from the time for binding of coﬁlin to F - actin ( to form c f ) and severing of ﬁlaments . Although free active coﬁlin rises immediately post - stimulus , F - actin - bound coﬂilin , c f , increases only ~ 10 s later . In turn , G - actin - bound coﬁlin , c m , generated after severing , starts to grow at ~ 20 s . Meanwhile , the level of phosphorylated coﬁlin , c p , increases more dramatically than c f . Note that the temporal proﬁle of c p , for which we have experimental data ( 17 ) , is part of the data - ﬁtting process ( Fig . 2 B , inset ) and increases from 20 % at rest to > 50 % poststimulus . Observe , however , that the rise of c p does not yet match the fast exper - imentalrise , aswesofarassumedthatthephosphorylationrate is constant . We correct this further on . In Fig . 3 , we compare magnitudes of several poststimulus rates , including the F - actin severing rate ( f sev ( c f ) ) ( ﬁrst term of Eq . 12 ) , the hydrolysis rate ( d hyd ( plc – 1 ) c 2 ) , the net actin - binding rate ( k on Fc aE þ k off c f ) , and the net diffusion of active coﬁlin out of the edge compartment ( ( u D / v E ) ( c a I – c aE ) ) . Diffusion dominates after stimulation : the large ﬂux of c 2 released into the edge compartment creates a large concen - tration gradient in active coﬁlin that rapidly diffuses to the cell interior . Phosphorylation and F - actin binding are slower and less pronounced . Thus , the delay in barbed - end generation stems from competition of coﬁlin binding to F - actin with coﬁlin diffusion and phosphorylation . As c f slowly builds up , severing follows . Note that the rate of severing shown in Fig . 3 is lower than other processes . The peak of severing occurs at ~ 90 s , consistent with the peak of barbed ends . Effects of LIMK up - / downregulation We asked how the up - / downregulation of LIMK ( the kinase that phosphorylates coﬁlin ) affects the dynamics . This is of particular interest , since overexpression of LIMK has been reported to both enhance and inhibit cell motility ( 12 , 25 , 26 ) . Moreover , upregulation of LIMK expression is also observed in invasive cancer cells , along with increased coﬁlin activity ( 27 ) . To study the effect of LIMK expression in our model , we examined how changing k mp ( rate of coﬁlin phosphorylation ) by a factor of 2 affects the dynamics . Increasing k mp leads to a higher steady - state c p value and thus less severing and fewer barbed ends . However , it also lowers the steady - state barbed - end level , b ss , in such a way that the ampliﬁcation b peak / b ss actually increases ( Fig . 4 A ) . Doubling k mp leads to a > 20 - fold ampliﬁcation . 0 200 1 1 . 5 2 p l c t ( s ) 0 200 0 0 . 5 1 p 2 t ( s ) A 0 100 200 300 4 8 12 b t ( s ) data from Mouneimne , et al . , 2004 0 100 200 300 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 t ( s ) F r ac t i on c o f ili n c 2 c p c m c a c f B 0 100 200 300 0 0 . 5 1 c p t ( s ) data from Song , et al . , 2006 FIGURE 2 Dynamics of the system in response to EGF stimulation .

Biophysical Journal 100 ( 8 ) 1883 – 1892 Coﬁlin Induces Barbed - End Generation 1887 The timing of the barbed - end peak is unchanged . Since phosphorylation liberates coﬁlin from G / F - actin bound forms , c m and c f , increasing k mp also leads to a larger basal c 2 , i . e . , a greater proportion of coﬁlin stored in a readily recruitable form is available for release and activation upon stimulation . Analyzing the steady - state dependence , we ﬁnd that at very low k mp , steady - state coﬁlin is dominated by c m with very little c 2 ( Fig . 4 B ) . As k mp increases , c 2 and c p increase and c m decreases monotonically . Further , c f and c a ﬁrst increase , then decrease with k mp . This nonmonotonicity leads to a nonmonotonic dependence of steady - state barbed ends ( b ss ) and transient peak ( b peak ) on k mp ( Fig . 4 B , lower ) . Initially , as k mp is increased , more PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin is available to be released so that the barbed - end levels at rest and after stimulation also increase . At the higher range ( k mp > k on F ) , phosphorylation robs activated coﬁlin before it can bind to and sever F - actin . These results imply that regulation of coﬁlin by the basal level of LIMK plays a role not only in limiting the action of severing , but also in both up - and downregulation of barbed - end ampliﬁcation . Dynamics of LIMK Absent in the model so far are the dynamics of LIMK and SSH poststimulation by EGF . Partly due to that simpliﬁca - tion , c p dynamics ( Fig . 2 , inset ) were so far not closely matched to the experimental data , despite the ﬁtting proce - dure . Song et al . ( 17 ) showed that active / phosphorylated LIMK doubles and stays elevated for 360 s poststimulation . The ( unmeasured ) level of SSH can be inferred to rise since the phosphocoﬁlin level also remained elevated at 360 s after stimulation ( 17 ) . We asked how such LIMK / SSH dynamics could affect our conclusions . To avoid signiﬁcantly increasing the model complexity , we simply ﬁt a time - varying function f ( t ) to the LIMK data in Song et al . ( 17 ) ( Fig . 5 , upper ) . We assumed that LIMK ¼ k mp (cid:3) f ( t ) and SSH ¼ k pm (cid:3) f ( t ) , i . e . , that LIMK and SSH activities were proportional to f ( t ) . We compare the output for dynamic LIMK , dynamic LIMK - SSH , and the original model in Fig . 5 . In the ﬁrst case ( k mp (cid:3) f ( t ) , k pm ¼ constant ) , b peak is only half of its value in the basic model . This model variant has rampant coﬁlin phosphorylation due to the poststimulus rise of LIMK activity . Thus , active coﬁlin , c a , can hardly build up ( Fig . 5 , lower right ) , so there is less coﬁlin binding to F - actin , less severing , and thus a lower b peak . With both LIMK and SSH dynamics , ampliﬁcation is ~ 8 . The dynamics of coﬁlin forms ( Fig . S10 ) , particularly those in the interior compartment , are fairly similar across the three model variants , with the level of c a showing the greatest impact of dynamic LIMK . We also explored the possibility that the edge compart - ment is protected from phosphorylation , as suggested by data from Song et al . ( 17 ) , by setting k mp ¼ k pm ¼ 0 in the edge compartment in the same dynamic LIMK / SSH model variant ( Fig . 6 ) . The steady - state value of c 2 is slightly lower whereas c f and b ss are elevated . Barbed - end ampliﬁcation is ~ 10 - fold ( Fig . 6 , upper ) . As expected , the build - up of c pE is retarded when LIMK activity is minimal in the edge compartment . Including SSH dynamics leads to cell - interior coﬁlin dynamics similar to those of the original model ( Fig . 6 , lower ) . A comparison with previous results ( Fig . 5 ) shows that with membrane - edge protection , barbed ends peak more quickly ( at a rate similar to that of the original model ) but then also drop more quickly after peaking . We attribute the decrease in barbed - end ampliﬁcation here not only to the drop in c 2 level ready for release but also to the lack of reactivation occurring within the edge compartment after the ﬁrst round of severing . This is shown in Fig . 6 ( middle ) , where we plotted the level of c f scaled by its basal / steady - state level . Thus , early barbed - end production is sensitively tuned to events within the small edge compartment of the 10 −3 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 S t ea d y S t a t e F r ac t i on c 2 c p c f c a c m B 10 −3 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 0 10 20 B a r b e d E nd s × k mp 10 −3 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 0 50 100 M ax b ( t ) / b ss Max b ( t ) b ss amplification 0 100 200 300 0 5 10 15 20 25 t ( s ) b / b ss decreasing k mp A 0 100 200 300 0 10 20 b t decreasing k mp 1 x k mp 2 x k mp 0 . 5 x k mp FIGURE 4 Effects of changing the coﬁlin phos - phorylation rate , k mp , reﬂecting basal LIMK activity , on barbed - end generation .

DISCUSSION In addition to recycling old actin ﬁlaments , coﬁlin plays an important role in initiating cell movement by severing ﬁlaments and generating new barbed ends . Our two - compartment ordinary - differential - equation model of coﬁ - lin dynamics downstream of EGF stimulation in cancer cells reproduces the early transient actin ﬁlament barbed - end production observed experimentally , and dissects the coﬁlin - induced F - actin severing into underlying steps . The model allows us to estimate rates of transition between various forms of coﬁlin by matching predictions and exper - imental data for both resting levels and stimulated levels of measurable quantities . Further , the model predicts the levels of variables ( such as the fraction of active coﬁlin ) that are currently beyond experimental resolution . The model demonstrates that the response of the system is most strongly affected by 1 ) , the fraction of PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin ( c 2 ) in the resting cell available for release ; and 2 ) , the rate of binding and severing of F - actin relative to competing processes such as coﬁlin phosphorylation or diffusion . Another important take - home lesson is that upregulating the coﬁlin regulator LIMK can actually lead to a more ampliﬁed response to EGF stimulation , i . e . , a greater ampli - ﬁcation in barbed - end production poststimulation , even though the primary role of LIMK is to deactivate coﬁlin . An essential component of our model is a strong nonlin - earity in the severing rate as a function of active coﬁlin . In fact , we believe that the coﬁlin - actin cooperative binding kinetics ( 21 , 22 ) is responsible for generating the transient 10 - to 15 - fold barbed - end ampliﬁcation ( 1 ) . This assump - tion is consistent with previous in vitro and modeling studies on coﬁlin - actin binding ( 21 , 28 , 29 ) , which show that coﬁlin binds cooperatively to F - actin with Hill - like kinetics of degree n ¼ 4 – 10 . We explored a range of values of n and found that a ﬁt to the experimental data within the 95 % conﬁdence interval could be achieved with values of 4 % n % 10 . We chose the value n ¼ 4 as it yielded one of the best ﬁts . Coﬁlin binding changes the ﬂexibility of actin ﬁlaments , allowing more coﬁlin to bind ; the enhanced bending ﬂexibility also promotes severing ( 22 , 30 , 31 ) .

( Lower ) Dynamics of free active ( left ) and phosphorylated ( right ) coﬁlin on the edge compartment . Biophysical Journal 100 ( 8 ) 1883 – 1892 Coﬁlin Induces Barbed - End Generation 1889 conjectured , but not yet conﬁrmed , that mechanical tension at the cell edge may also affect coﬁlin dynamics ( E . De La Cruz , Yale University , personal communication , 2011 ) . In building our model , we used mostly data from mammary carcinoma cells in vivo . Direct in vitro measure - ment is largely lacking , hindering the estimation of dephos - phorylation and phosphorylation rates of coﬁlin . Having a ﬁner temporal measurement of simultaneous levels of vari - ables would be helpful in data ﬁtting and in resolving the exact temporal dynamics . From our parameter sensitivity study , we also found a crit - icalparameter , namelythebasalamountofPIP 2 - boundcoﬁlin ( c 2 z 0 . 6 at rest ) needed to faithfully reproduce the experi - mental data . This means that ~ 60 % of total coﬁlin should be in thePIP 2 - boundform intheresting cell fordynamicsconsis - tent with observations . This is possible given the localization of coﬁlin with PIP 2 observed in carcinoma cells ( 14 ) . Although a large barbed - end ampliﬁcation is possible at a lower level of c 2 , the level of phosphocoﬁlin cannot then increase to the level observed experimentally ( 17 ) . Limitations of this model include the very coarse spatial representation ( two compartments only ) and inclusion of few key intermediates . We did not model here the dynamics of F - actin that takes place once the newly formed barbed ends start to grow and extend . In experiments , F - actin has been found to increase by less than twofold within 60 s after EGF stimulation . A more signiﬁcant increase occurs later , once Arp2 / 3 activity is promoted ( 23 ) ( not currently modeled ) . The second peak of barbed ends stems from Arp2 / 3 - mediated F - actin branching ( 1 ) . Tests of the model with a dynamic F - actin variable showed minimal effect beyond that described here and was deemed insigniﬁcant relative to other processes on the timescale of 1 min . Coﬁlin has other roles that we did not include here . In vitro studies have shown that , depending on conditions , ADF / coﬁlin ( at low concentrations ) severs but ( at higher levels ) depolymerizes F - actin ( 6 – 9 ) . The latter helps to recycle G - actin and promote rapid barbed - end growth ( 10 , 32 , 33 ) . Other effects of coﬁlin include release of the phosphate groups from F - actin , promoting dissociation of Arp2 / 3 complexes from ADP - F - actin and consequent de - branching of ﬁlaments ( 6 , 34 ) . At a very high concentration ( > 10 m M ) , coﬁlin can also nucleate ﬁlaments de novo ( 6 ) . In the interest of keeping the ﬁrst models tractable , such effects were not modeled here . These could form extensions of the basic model as a future step . Our results strongly suggest that the level of barbed - end production is mainly dependent on events occurring within a thin compartment abutting the cell membrane rather than the large interior cytosolic compartment . Comparing the two - versus one - compartment model ( where there is no distinction between cell edge and interior ) , we found that the latter signiﬁcantly underestimates the barbed - end peak , and the time course of its rising phase ( see Supporting Mate - rial ) . Spatial localization is crucial , as coﬁlin binding to F - actinis restricted to theedgecompartment , whereﬁlaments are not protected by tropomyosinand where coﬁlinphosphor - ylation may be low . If this is true , then , as we have shown , upon release from the membrane , active coﬁlin strongly targets F - actin rather than being diverted to competing pro - cesses . We then attain the same rate of barbed - end production even in the concurrent presence of upregulated LIMK activity . As spatial localization appears to play an important role in determining the response of the system , further modeling based on a spatially extended system that can describe coﬁlin gradients forms a promising future direction . Thus far in this model , we have considered only the action of coﬁlin ( and ﬁrst barbed - end peak ) and not the dynamics of Arp2 / 3 associated with a second peak of barbed ends . Whereas coﬁlin binds preferentially to ADP - actin rather than ATP - actin monomers ( 7 , 11 ) , Arp2 / 3 has a higher afﬁnity to ATP - actin ﬁlaments . Thus , coﬁlin severing , which allows for new F - actin growth , also promotes subsequent ﬁlament branching by Arp2 / 3 ( 1 – 3 ) . Hence , coﬁlin and Arp2 / 3 activities work in synergy to create a large increase in actin polymerization ( 35 ) . Testing the boundaries of this synergy forms another interesting future direction .
