Young Drive South , Los Angeles , CA 90095 , USA Keywords : antibody , FcRn , interactions , promiscuity , therapeutic antibodies Abstract Preclinical tests of therapeutic antibodies are frequently carried out in mice to evaluate pharmacokinetics and efﬁcacy . However , the observation that mouse IgG are cleared rapidly from the human circulation suggests that mice may not always be an ideal model . The Fc receptor , FcRn , regulates the serum half - lives of IgG in mice and most likely has a similar function in humans . In the current study we have carried out an extensive analysis of the interaction of the human or mouse forms of FcRn with IgG from various species using surface plasmon resonance . We show that in contrast to mouse FcRn , human FcRn is surprisingly stringent in its binding speciﬁcity for IgG derived from different species . Human FcRn binds to human , rabbit and guinea pig IgG , but not signiﬁcantly to rat , bovine , sheep or mouse IgG ( with the exception of weak binding to mouse IgG2b ) . In contrast , mouse FcRn binds to all IgG analyzed . The lack of binding of human FcRn to mouse IgG1 has been conﬁrmed using transfectants that have been engineered to express human FcRn on the cell surface . Our results provide a molecular explanation for the enigmatic observation that mouse IgG behave anomalously in humans . These studies have implications for the successful application of therapeutic antibodies . Introduction During the past several years there has been an increased interest in the development of therapeutic antibodies , primarily due to the development of genetic engineering approaches to produce IgG with improved properties ( reviewed in 1 ) . Prior to use in humans , preclinical tests are routinely carried out in animal species . For example , analyses of the pharmaco - kinetics of a therapeutic IgG are frequently performed in mice . Knowledge of the pharmacokinetics is essential for effective use of an antibody in a particular therapeutic / diagnostic application . An indication that mice may not be an ideal species in which to model the pharmacokinetics of an IgG for use in humans , however , is the observation that mouse IgG is cleared rapidly from the human circulation relative to its long serum persistence in mice ( 2 , 3 ) . This rapid clearance may contribute to the disappointing performance of mouse antibodies in clinical trials , particularly when extended treat - ment regimens are used ( 4 ) . Understanding the molecular basis for this phenomenon is the focus of the current study . Correspondence to : E . S . Ward Transmitting editor : D . Fearon Received 24 May 2001 , accepted 12 September 2001 It has been suggested previously that the short half - life of mouse IgG in humans is due to differential glycosylation of IgG in mouse versus human cells , resulting in the presence of Gal α 1 – 3Gal residues in antibodies produced in murine cells ( 4 ) . In humans , these residues may be recognized by a high titer of anti - Gal α 1 – 3Gal antibodies resulting in short serum persistence . However , therapeutic humanized anti - bodies produced in murine cells have been reported to have half - lives of 20 days , indicating that the involvement of anti - Gal α 1 – 3Gal antibodies in the rapid removal of murine IgG may be negligible ( 5 ) . Thus , the reason for the anomalous pharmacokinetics of mouse IgG in humans has been a matter of controversy . Until recently , knowledge of the mechanism by which serum IgG levels are maintained in the circulation was limited . Studies in mice indicate that the MHC class I - related receptor , FcRn ( 6 ) , regulates the serum levels of IgG ( 7 – 9 ) , in addition 1552 Antibody – FcRn interactions across species to the known role of this receptor in the transfer of IgG from mother to young ( 10 ) . The receptor carries out these apparently diverse roles by binding to the Fc region of IgG , and transporting the bound IgG within and across cells ( 11 , 12 ) . It is therefore a protective receptor , salvaging IgG molecules from degradation following uptake into FcRn - expressing cells ( 13 ) . As a consequence , IgG molecules that do not bind to FcRn are not transported from mother to young ( 14 ) and have an abnormally short serum persistence ( 15 , 16 ) . Furthermore , there is a direct correlation between binding afﬁnity of IgG / Fc fragments for FcRn and their serum half - lives in mice ( 16 ) . This knowledge has been used to engineer antibodies with predeﬁned serum persistence ( 17 ) . Although much is now known about FcRn function in rodents ( 13 ) , less is known about the role of the human homolog ( 18 ) . Human FcRn is expressed in placenta ( 19 – 21 ) and recent studies indicate that this receptor plays an essential role in IgG transfer across the in vitro perfused placenta ( 22 ) . As in mice ( 23 ) , human FcRn has been reported to be expressed in endothelial cells , suggesting that it is also involved in serum IgG homeostasis ( 24 ) . The site of binding for rodent FcRn on human and mouse IgG molecules closely overlaps , and encompasses Ile253 , His310 and His435 ( 16 , 25 , 26 ) . These residues are located at the C H 2 – C H 3 domain interface ( 27 ) in the Fc region of IgG and are highly conserved across species ( 28 ) . The less - conserved residue at position 436 ( His in most mouse and rat IgG isotypes , Tyr or Phe in human IgG ) also plays a role in binding to rodent FcRn ( 16 , 26 , 29 ) . A recent analysis indicated that individual mutation of Ile253 , Ser254 , His435 and Tyr436 of human IgG1 to alanine essen - tially ablates binding to human FcRn ( 29 ) . An essential role for His435 in FcRn - mediated transfer of human IgG1 across the ex vivo placenta has also been demonstrated ( 22 ) . However , to our knowledge , the interaction of human FcRn with IgG from heterologous species has not been investigated . In addition , analysis of the binding characteristics of mouse / rat FcRn has been limited to rodent FcRn – rodent IgG or rodent FcRn – human IgG interactions ( 15 , 25 , 26 , 30 – 32 ) . In the current study we have attempted to better understand FcRn function in humans by comparing the binding properties of human and mouse FcRn . Extensive BIAcore analyses of the binding of IgG from various species ( human , mouse , rabbit , guinea pig , bovine , sheep and rat ) to recombinant human and mouse FcRn have been carried out to analyze the cross - species speciﬁcity of these two Fc receptors . In addition , a novel cell binding assay in which transfectants engineered to express human FcRn on the cell surface has been used to analyze IgG – FcRn interactions with membrane - bound receptor . The binding data using the two approaches are consistent and indicate that in contrast to mouse FcRn which binds to IgG of every species analyzed , human FcRn is surprisingly stringent in its speciﬁcity . The lack of binding of human FcRn to most mouse isotypes , in particular , provides a molecular explanation as to why mouse IgG have short serum persistence in humans . This provides further support for the hypothesis that FcRn regulates serum IgG half - life in man . The marked differences in binding speciﬁcity between human and mouse FcRn have implications for the successful application of therapeutic antibodies in humans . Fig . 1 . Overlays of sensorgrams of 1 µ M mouse or human FcRn injected over immobilized human IgG1 ( 784 RU ) ( A ) , mouse IgG1 ( 914 RU ) ( B ) , mouse IgG2b ( 650 RU ) ( C ) or rabbit IgG ( 3023 RU ) ( D ) . All sensorgrams are representative of duplicate injections . Methods Sources of IgG Recombinant human IgG1 ( HuLys10 ) secreted by transfected myeloma cells ( a generous gift of Dr Jeff Foote , Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center , Seattle ) was isolated and puriﬁed as described previously ( 33 ) . This is a humanized variant of the murine anti - hen egg lysozyme antibody D1 . 3 ( 33 ) . Human IgG was isolated from a commercial ‘gammaglobulin’ prepara - tion ( Sandoz , East Hanover , NJ ; containing IgG , and a low percentage of IgM , IgA , transferrin and dimeric IgG ) by afﬁnity puriﬁcation over Protein G – Sepharose and HPLC on a TSK - 3000SW column . Rabbit and guinea pig IgG were obtained from normal sera ( purchased from Sigma , St Louis , MO ) by afﬁnity chromatography on Protein A – Sepharose . The subclasses of guinea pig IgG were obtained by further fractionation on DEAE – Sepharose ( 34 ) . Bovine and sheep IgG were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , MA ) . Rat and mouse IgG subclasses were purchased from Zymed ( South San Francisco , CA ) . Mouse IgG2b was also isolated from mouse serum using previously described methods ( 35 ) . The source of mouse IgG1 was either a mAb directed against human CD22 ( RFB4 ) ( 36 ) , against human CD25 ( RFT5 ) or against hen egg lysozyme ( D1 . 3 ) ( 37 ) . Recombinant FcRn Recombinant mouse and human FcRn were expressed in infected High - Five cells and puriﬁed as described previ - ously ( 15 , 22 ) . Surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) experiments CM5 sensor chips were coupled with IgG of different species at densities ranging from ~ 600 to 3000 RU , using a BIAcore 2000 . In addition , for use as a reference cell , one ﬂow cell was treated with coupling buffer only during the coupling reaction . Human or mouse FcRn was injected over the coupled ﬂow cells at concentrations ranging from 0 . 17 to 2 µ M at a ﬂow rate of 10 µ l / min in PBS , pH 6 . 0 plus 0 . 01 % Tween 20 . Each injection was carried out in duplicate and the data were processed by zero adjusting and reference cell subtraction Antibody – FcRn interactions across species 1553 Table 1 .

ND , not determined as (cid:1) 0 . using either BIAevaluation 3 . 0 or custom written software . Dissociation constants were not calculated as for some species , ﬂow cells were coupled simultaneously with all IgG isotypes of that species . This resulted in heterogeneity of the ligand , making calculated dissociation constants meaning - less . In addition , for some species FcRn is known to bind to two possible sites on IgG with different afﬁnities ( 38 , 39 ) and the stoichiometry of the FcRn – IgG interaction for the majority of the IgG used in this study has not been analyzed . Thus , the binding of human FcRn relative to mouse FcRn to IgG of each species is expressed as R eq ( hFcRn ) / R eq ( mFcRn ) where R eq ( hFcRn ) is the signal level ( in RU ) at equilibrium for 1 µ M human FcRn and R eq ( mFcRn ) is the signal level ( in RU ) at equilibrium for 1 µ M mouse FcRn . Generation of transfectants expressing human FcRn The gene encoding full - length human FcRn was isolated from the intestinal epithelial cell line , Caco - 2 ( ATCC HTB 37 ) , using RT - PCR and designed oligonucleotide primers . This gene was tailored with 5 (cid:2) and 3 (cid:2) Eco RI sites and cloned in frame into the Eco RI site of pEGFP - N1 ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) . A mutated variant of the FcRn gene was also cloned into this vector . This mutant was generated by converting Leu320 - Leu321 ( in the cytoplasmic tail ) to Ala320Ala321 using designed oligonucleotides and splicing by overlap extension ( 40 ) . The FcRn – green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) expression plasmids were transfected into Jurkat cells by electroporation and clones selected in RPMI containing 10 % FCS , 10 mM HEPES , 1 mM L - glutamine and 1 mg / ml G418 . Selected clones were screened by ﬂow cytometry and cloned by limiting dilution . Fluorescence microscopy Images of transfectants expressing human FcRn – GFP fusions were acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope with a Hamamatsu Orca 100 camera . Epiﬂuorescence images were acquired with a Zeiss (cid:3) 100 NA 1 . 4 Plan Apo objective and Chroma EGFP ﬁlter set . Total internal reﬂection microscopy ( TIRFM ) images were acquired with an Olympus (cid:3) 100 NA 1 . 65 Plan Apo objective . TIRFM was achieved by excitation with a Spectra Physics laser at 488 nm . The total internal reﬂection set - up was custom made following the through - objective excitation model . In TIRFM the illumination level decreases exponentially depending on the distance from the coverslip . As a result ﬂuorescent labels ( GFP ) are excited only in a relatively thin layer near the coverglass that includes the membrane of a cell juxtaposed on the coverglass . Images for both mutant and wild - type cells were acquired with the same exposure time ( 3 s ) . Individual cells were placed at the center of the ﬁeld of view using transmitted and epiﬂuorescent illumination , and the focal plane scanned away from the coverslip . No subsequent processing such as contrast adjust - ment was carried out . Binding of IgG to transfectants expressing human FcRn Two types of binding assay were used . For use in all assays , cells were grown in medium containing FCS which had been depleted of endogenous IgG by passage over Protein G – Sepharose . In the ﬂow cytometric assays , IgG were biotinyl - ated ( NHS - biotin ; Pierce , Rockville , MD ) and preincubated with Extravidin – phycoerythrin ( PE ) in an ~ 4 : 1 ( IgG : Extravidin ) molar ratio to ‘multimerize’ the IgG molecules . These com - plexes ( containing 2 µ g IgG ) were then added to transfectants ( 2 (cid:3) 10 6 / ml in 100 µ l ) , incubated for 30 min at 4°C in 1 % BSA / PBS , pH 6 . 0 and washed twice with PBS , pH 6 . 0 or 7 . 2 . Cells were analyzed by two - color ﬂow cytometry and data were plotted using WinMDI version 2 . 8 . In additional binding assays , IgG dimers were generated and used . Human and mouse IgG1 ( RFB4 ) were dimerized by cross - linking with succinimidyl 4 - ( maleimidomethyl cyclo - hexane ) and N - succinimidyl S - acethylthio - acetate ( Pierce ) as described ( 41 ) . The IgG dimers ( M r ~ 300 kDa ) were puriﬁed by HPLC using a preparative TSK - 3000SW column ( TosoHaas , Montgomeryville , PA ) , and contained (cid:1) 10 % monomers and polymers as determined by SDS – PAGE ( PhastSystem ; Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) . The IgG dimers were biotinylated or radiolabeled with [ 125 I ] Na using the Iodogen method ( 42 ) to a speciﬁc activity of 1 µ Ci / µ g . Biotinylated dimer was incubated with transfectants as above , except that cells were ﬁrst incubated with 2 – 4 µ g dimer for 30 min at 4°C , washed once in PBS , pH 6 . 0 and then incubated with 0 . 4 µ g Extravidin – PE for a further 30 min at 4°C . Cells were washed twice with PBS , pH 6 . 0 or 7 . 2 and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry as above . For the analysis of binding of radiolabeled dimers , cells ( 1 (cid:3) 10 7 / ml ) were incubated at 4°C for 1 h with varying amounts of radioligands and for each concentration , 100 µ l aliquots ( in triplicate ) were centrifuged in 200 µ l Fisher plastic tubes over an 1 : 1 oil mixture dibutylphthalate / phthalic acid bis ( 2 - ethylhexylester ) ( Sigma ) . The test tubes were frozen at – 80°C , tips containing the sedimented cells cut off and the radioactivity measured in a γ - counter ( Pharmacia ) . The binding of the radioligands was carried out at pH 6 . 0 and 1554 Antibody – FcRn interactions across species Fig . 2 . ( A ) Structure ( α - carbon trace ) of the Fc region of human IgG1 ( 27 ) with the location of the residues shown to be involved in mouse , rat or human FcRn binding indicated ( 22 , 25 , 26 , 29 , 30 ) .

The speciﬁc binding of the ligands was calculated by subtracting the amount bound at pH 7 . 5 from that bound at pH 6 . 0 . The speciﬁcity of the binding was demonstrated by using a 500 - fold excess of unlabeled human IgG dimer . Analysis of biotinylation of IgG Biotinylated , monomeric IgG were coated onto wells of 96 - well plates in varying concentrations and detected with an Extravidin – horseradish peroxidase conjugate ( Sigma ) . Binding of IgG dimers to Fc γ RII Daudi cells ( Fc γ RII (cid:4) ) at 2 (cid:3) 10 6 cells / ml were treated with various concentrations of radiolabeled human and mouse IgG dimers in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % FCS at pH 7 . 4 for 1 h at 4°C . The cell - bound radioactivity was determined using centrifugation through oil as described above . The speciﬁcity of the binding was determined by using a 500 - fold excess of unlabeled human or mouse IgG dimer . Results Initial studies using soluble recombinant human or mouse FcRn using SPR indicated that both species of FcRn bind to human IgG1 ( Fig . 1 ) . Binding to other human IgG isotypes was not analyzed here as recent studies indicate that the human FcRn – IgG interaction is similar for all subclasses ( 43 ) ( our unpublished data ) . Consistent with our earlier data ( 22 ) , the afﬁnity of the human FcRn – human IgG1 interaction is signiﬁcantly lower than that of mouse FcRn – human IgG1 complex formation ( Fig . 1 and Table 1 ) . However , in contrast to mouse FcRn , human FcRn shows negligible binding to mouse IgG1 ( Fig . 1 and Table 1 ) . Analyses of the binding of human FcRn to other mouse IgG isotypes demonstrated essentially no interaction with mouse IgG2a and a weak interaction with mouse IgG2b ( Fig . 1 and Table 1 ) . Analysis of sequence differences between human IgG1 and the murine IgG isotypes in the vicinity of the FcRn interaction site ( 16 , 25 , 26 , 44 , 45 ) ( Fig . 2 ) suggested that variation of position 436 ( histidine in mouse IgG1 , 2a ; tyrosine in human IgG1 , mouse IgG2b ) ( 28 ) might explain the differential binding . This prompted an analysis of the interaction of human and mouse FcRn with IgG from different species for which position 436 is either histidine ( all rat isotypes ) , tyrosine ( sheep , rabbit , bovine ) or valine ( guinea pig ) ( 28 ) . The binding data are summarized in Table 1 by expressing the activity of human FcRn as the equilibrium signal level ( R eq , in RU ) for 1 µ M human FcRn divided by the equilibrium signal level for 1 µ M mouse FcRn . From these data it is clear that the majority of IgG are not bound at signiﬁcant levels by human FcRn . In contrast , mouse FcRn binds well to every IgG tested . For several reasons dissociation constants for each interaction were not calculated in these studies . First , in several cases , mixed isotypes were used as immobilized ligand and this results in ligand heterogeneity . Second , IgG has two possible interaction sites for FcRn ( 38 , 39 ) and the stoichiometry of the FcRn – IgG interaction is not known for most of the IgG isotypes analyzed . However , the semi - quantitative data shown in Table 1 clearly demonstrate that human FcRn is highly stringent in its binding speciﬁcity , whereas mouse FcRn cross - reacts with all IgG tested . A cell binding assay was also developed to allow a possible correlation between IgG interactions with soluble FcRn in SPR Antibody – FcRn interactions across species 1555 Fig . 3 . Expression of mutated or wild - type human FcRn tagged with GFP in transfected Jurkat cells . ( A ) Epiﬂuorescence images . ( B ) TIRFM images to visualize only membrane associated ﬂuorescence . All images are representative of multiple cells analyzed . and membrane - bound FcRn to be investigated . Jurkat cell transfectants which express a mutated , human FcRn – GFP fusion on the cell surface were generated . The mutation of FcRn involves conversion of the dileucine motif ( residues 320 / 321 ) in the cytosolic tail to di - alanine , and this motif is known to regulate receptor internalization ( 46 , 47 ) . Relative to transfectants expressing wild - type FcRn – GFP ( ‘WT’ ) which have undetectable levels of surface FcRn , microscopic ana - lyses using both epiﬂuorescence and TIRFM demonstrate that the mutated FcRn ( ‘MUT’ ) is present on the cell surface of transfectants ( Fig . 3 ) . Both transfectants express similar levels of total FcRn – GFP ( Fig . 4 ) , excluding the possibility that the differential surface expression was due to variations in protein levels . The surface expression of FcRn allows the MUT cells to be used in direct binding assays with labeled IgG . However , when labeled , monomeric IgG were used in various forms , undetectable binding was observed . This is consistent with the relatively low afﬁnity and fast dissociation of human FcRn for / from cognate ligand ( ~ 2 µ M ) ( 22 ) . To compensate for the low afﬁnity of the FcRn – IgG interaction , the avidity of the interaction was increased by incubating biotinylated IgG with Extravidin ( labeled with PE ) to generate multimeric complexes . Figure 4 shows binding analyses using ﬂow cytometry of biotinylated , multimerized human IgG1 and mouse IgG1 to the WT and MUT transfectants . Binding analyses were carried out at pH 6 . 0 with washes at either pH 6 . 0 or 7 . 2 , as FcRn interacts with IgG at slightly acidic but not near neutral pH ( 15 , 30 ) . This pH dependence is necessary for the binding and recycling / transcytotic function of FcRn ( 13 ) . For human IgG1 a minor amount of binding to WT cells can be consistently detected at pH 6 . 0 ( Fig . 4 and data not shown ) . This binding cannot be detected at pH 7 . 2 ( data not shown ) , suggesting speciﬁcity for FcRn . The minor amount of IgG binding at pH 6 . 0 indicates that for the WT FcRn transfectants , there may be a limited amount of surface FcRn expression which is below the level of detection by immunoﬂuorescence ( Fig . 3 ) . The data with transfectants expressing MUT FcRn conﬁrm the high level of surface expression of this FcRn variant ( Figs 3 and 4 ) ; for human IgG1 signiﬁcant amounts of binding are 1556 Antibody – FcRn interactions across species Fig . 4 .

In contrast , and consistent with the SPR data , insigniﬁcant binding is seen for biotinylated mouse IgG1 ( Fig . 4 ) . The activity and biotinylation of the mouse IgG1 were analyzed using SPR ( with mouse FcRn ) and ELISA respectively , and excluded the possibility that either the mouse IgG1 is not active or has not been biotinylated . These studies were extended to the analysis of the binding of human or mouse IgG1 dimers ( 41 ) to the transfectants ( Fig . 5 ) . To assess the dose dependency and speciﬁcity of binding , the dimers were radiolabeled and added in varying amounts to the transfectants . The radiolabeled ( 125 I ) human IgG1 dimer bound to MUT transfectants in a dose - dependent way , whereas essentially background levels of binding of radiolabeled mouse IgG1 dimer were seen ( Fig . 5 ) . Similar results were obtained using ﬂow cytometry and biotinylated human and mouse IgG1 dimers ( using Extravidin – PE for detection ; data not shown ) . The binding of radiolabeled human IgG1 dimer ( at 0 . 5 µ g / 10 7 cells ) could be inhibited by (cid:5) 90 % by the addition of a 500 - fold excess of unlabeled human IgG1 ( data not shown ) . To assess the integrity of the Fc region of the radiolabeled mouse IgG1 dimer , binding to Fc γ RII on the surface of Daudi cells was analyzed . This Fc Fig . 5 .

The mouse IgG1 dimer binds to signiﬁcantly higher levels than the human IgG1 dimer , demonstrating that it has retained functional activity . The binding of both human and mouse IgG1 dimers to Daudi cells are equally well inhibited by a 500 - fold excess of unlabeled human or mouse IgG dimers ( (cid:5) 90 % inhibition ; data not shown ) , indicating speciﬁcity of binding . Discussion In the current study we have carried out an extensive analysis of the binding of IgG from a range of species to soluble recombinant mouse and human FcRn using SPR ( BIAcore ) experiments and a cell binding assay . It is well established that FcRn is a receptor that salvages IgG from degradation and regulates the serum half - life of IgG in mice ( 7 – 9 ) . Recent data indicate that the human homolog of mouse FcRn serves a similar function in humans ( 22 , 24 ) . Our analyses demon - strate that mouse FcRn is promiscuous in binding speciﬁcity and binds to all IgG species analyzed , i . e . human , mouse , rabbit , guinea pig , bovine , sheep and rat IgG . In contrast , human FcRn is surprisingly stringent , and only interacts well with human , rabbit and guinea pig IgG . Of particular interest , Antibody – FcRn interactions across species 1557 Table 2 .

Note that for human FcRn the two amino acid deletion ( residues 85 , 86 ) is ignored in the numbering which corresponds to the homology alignment of rodent and human FcRn . c In all rat isotypes , except in rat IgG2a where residue 311 is Arg ( 28 ) . d In all human isotypes , except in an IgG3 allotype where residue 435 is Arg ( 28 ) . e In all mouse isotypes , except in IgG2b where residue 435 is Tyr ( 28 ) . f In all human isotypes , except in an IgG3 allotype where residue 436 is Phe ( 28 ) . g In all mouse isotypes , except in IgG2b where residue 436 is Tyr ( 28 ) . human FcRn does not bind detectably to mouse IgG1 and IgG2a , and shows a very weak interaction with mouse IgG2b . The high selectivity of the human FcRn – IgG interaction there - fore gives a molecular explanation for the enigmatic observa - tion that mouse IgG are cleared rapidly from the human circulation ( 2 , 3 ) . Despite this observation many years ago , to date a satisfactory explanation had been lacking ( 5 ) . Signiﬁcantly , the current analyses further implicate a role for FcRn in regulating the pharmacokinetics of serum IgG in humans . The high off - rate of the human FcRn – IgG interaction reported previously in SPR studies ( 22 ) together with the undetectable binding of monomeric human IgG1 to transfec - tants expressing surface FcRn ( MUT transfectants ) raises the question as to how FcRn carries out its role in vivo . FcRn functions to maintain circulating levels of monomeric IgG or to transport monomeric IgG molecules across cellular barriers ( reviewed in 13 ) . This suggests that wild - type , membrane - bound FcRn is able to form higher - order aggregates ( e . g . dimers ) ( 50 ) that increase the avidity of the FcRn – IgG inter - action . Consistent with a role for avidity effects , in SPR experiments immobilized human FcRn has a signiﬁcantly higher afﬁnity / avidity for human IgG than the afﬁnity of the FcRn interaction with immobilized IgG ( 22 , 43 ) . Furthermore , studies with rodent and human FcRn indicate that FcRn can bind to two possible sites on IgG , albeit with different intrinsic afﬁnities ( 38 , 39 , 43 ) . A possible reason for the need to multi - merize IgG to detect binding to MUT FcRn transfectants is therefore that mutation of the cytoplasmic dileucine motif to dialanine results in defects in aggregation of the membrane exposed FcRn . Alternatively , the density of FcRn on the cell surface may be lower than that when it is endosomally located . Both these possibilities would be predicted to result in a decreased efﬁciency of FcRn binding to the putative receptor interaction sites on both ‘sides’ of an IgG molecule to form 1 : 2 IgG : FcRn complexes . Despite this , the MUT transfectants provide a valuable cell binding assay and give rise to data that is consistent with our SPR analyses . The homology shared between human and mouse FcRn ( 18 , 51 ) , together with the observation that IgG residues such as His435 play a central role in the IgG : FcRn interaction of both rodent and human FcRn ( 16 , 22 , 25 , 26 , 29 ) , led to the earlier conclusion that these interactions are very similar across species . In the current study we have carried out an analysis of the interactions of human and mouse FcRn with human , mouse , rabbit , guinea pig , bovine , sheep and rat IgG which signiﬁcantly extends our knowledge of human / mouse FcRn interactions to IgG of multiple species . Previously , analyses of FcRn binding to IgG had been restricted to homologous IgG with the exception of mouse FcRn / rat or human IgG and rat FcRn / human or mouse IgG ( 15 , 25 , 26 , 30 – 32 , 53 ) . The current analyses indicate that unexpectedly , human and mouse FcRn behave quite differently with respect to their cross - species binding behavior . The distinct cross - species behavior of human / mouse FcRn raises questions concerning the molecular basis for this phenomenon . Although the key residues that constitute the FcRn interaction site on IgG are conserved across species , there are some variations at ‘secondary’ IgG residues such as His436 ( 28 ) . Rat FcRn residues which have been shown in both functional and structural studies ( Glu117 , Glu118 , Glu132 , Trp133 , Glu135 and Asp137 ) to be involved in the rat FcRn – IgG interaction ( 26 , 32 ) , are well conserved across species with the exception of Asp137 ( 6 , 18 , 51 , 52 ) ( Table 2 ) . The location of these residues on the three - dimensional structure of rat FcRn is shown in Fig . 2 . In human FcRn residue 137 is replaced by Leu and Glu132 is conservatively replaced by Asp ( 18 ) ( Table 2 ) . In the rat FcRn – rat IgG complex ( 26 ) , Asp137 makes a salt bridge with His436 ( Table 2 ) . The replacement of this amino acid with Leu in human FcRn would preclude formation of this salt bridge and would also be energetically unfavorable due to the presumed juxtaposition of a hydrophobic residue next to His436 ( 54 ) . Although this could explain the lack of binding of human FcRn to mouse IgG1 , IgG2a and all rat IgG , it cannot be implicated in the inability of human FcRn to bind to bovine and sheep IgG which , like human IgG , have Tyr at position 436 . We ( 16 , 31 ) and others ( 29 ) have shown that in addition to the key IgG residues involved in binding to FcRn ( residues 253 , 310 , 435 and 436 ) , there are other residues at positions 254 , 255 , 257 , 288 , 296 , 307 , 309 , 315 , 415 and 433 that may play more minor ( indirect ) roles in the IgG – FcRn interaction . Analysis of the variability of these amino acids across species does not give a consistent explanation for the lack of binding 1558 Antibody – FcRn interactions across species of human FcRn to mouse , rat , sheep and bovine IgG . Thus , there is no obvious explanation for our observations con - cerning the high speciﬁcity of human FcRn . However , it is possible that the differences in cross - species behavior of mouse versus human FcRn could be due to the less exposed position of Trp133 , a residue that contacts Ile253 in the rat FcRn – Fc complex ( 26 ) , and / or deletion of residues 85 and 86 ( located in the α 1 domain ) in human FcRn ( 43 ) . In addition to giving an explanation for the observation that mouse IgG are cleared rapidly from the human circulation which may in turn explain their limited efﬁcacy in human therapy ( 4 ) , our ﬁndings have an additional consequence of practical signiﬁcance : they raise questions concerning the validity of using mice as a model to predict the pharmaco - kinetic behavior of a therapeutic antibody in humans . Mutation of His435 to alanine ablates the binding of human IgG1 to both mouse and human FcRn , in addition to decreasing activity of the IgG1 in FcRn - mediated functions such as transcytosis ( 22 , 25 , 29 ) . This suggests that FcRn – IgG inter - actions are , in some respects , very similar across species . However , we show here that there are also signiﬁcant differ - ences in the speciﬁcity of the interactions , with human FcRn demonstrating high selectivity for binding to IgG of a subset of species analyzed . The lack of interaction of human FcRn with most mouse and all rat IgG indicates that mice cannot be reliably used to extrapolate half - life data of rodent antibodies to humans . Although rodent IgG are now less frequently used in therapy , our observations indicate that a genetically manip - ulated antibody may behave differently in mouse and man . To predict the half - life of a therapeutic antibody in humans , preclinical studies in mice should therefore be complemented by binding studies with human FcRn . The high stringency of the human FcRn – IgG interaction described in this study has obvious implications for the effective use of genetically engineered antibodies in diagnosis and therapy .
