Cells moving on a 2dimensional substrate generate motion by polymerizing actin ﬁlament networks inside a ﬂat membrane protrusion . New ﬁlaments are generated by branching oﬀ existing ones , giving rise to branched network structures . We investigate the force - extension relation of branched ﬁlaments , grafted on an elastic structure at one end and pushing with the free ends against the leading edge cell membrane . Single ﬁlaments are modeled as worm - like chains , whose thermal bending ﬂuctuations are restricted by the leading edge cell membrane , resulting in an eﬀective force . Branching can increase the stiﬀness considerably ; however the eﬀect depends on branch point position and ﬁlament orientation , being most pronounced for intermediate tilt angles and intermediate branch point positions . We describe ﬁlament networks without cross - linkers to focus on the eﬀect of branching . We use randomly positioned branch points , as generated in the process of treadmilling , and orientation distributions as measured in lamellipodia . These networks reproduce both the weak and strong force response of lamellipodia as measured in force - velocity experiments . We compare properties of branched and unbranched networks . The ratio of the network average of the force per branched ﬁlament to the average force per unbranched ﬁlament depends on the orientation distribution of the ﬁlaments . The ratio exhibits compression dependence and may go up to about 4 . 5 in networks with a narrow orientation distribution . With orientation distributions measured in lamellipodia , it is about 2 and essentially independent from network compression , graft elasticity and ﬁlament persistence length .

Introduction The crawling of many diﬀerent cell types is essential for life . Undiﬀerentiated cells move towards the site , where they form a tissue or organ in the developing embryo . Skin cells start crawling when they have to close a wound [ 1 ] . During metastasis , cancer cells dissociate from the primary tumor , crawl towards blood vessels and spread all over the body [ 2 , 3 ] . Branched actin ﬁlaments carry forces during cell motion , and consequently understanding their elastic properties is central to understanding the mechanics of cell motility . In vitro , cells are plated on a two dimensional substrate to observe their dynamics . They form a ﬂat membrane protrusion in the direction of motion , the lamellipodium , which is only about 100 - 200 nm thick but several µ m deep and wide [ 4 ] . A dense network of actin ﬁlaments ( F - actin ) inside the lamellipodium pushes the leading edge membrane forward [ 5 ] . Treadmilling of the ﬁlaments drives motion [ 6 ] : Filament barbed ( or plus ) ends polymerize at the leading edge of the lamellipodium and the pointed ( or minus ) ends depolymerize at the rear . Usually cells move in response to an external signal . A variety of signals stimulate the activation of nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) ( like WASp or WAVE ) located in the leading edge membrane of the lamellipodium . They activate the actin related protein complex Arp2 / 3 . It binds to an existing ﬁlament very close to or at its barbed end at the lamellipodium’s leading edge . That initiates the growth of a new ﬁlament branch out of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Many of these branched structures consisting of mother ﬁlament and branch form the F - actin network in the lamellipodium . The branched structure itself is dynamic . The branch point with the Arp2 / 3 complex moves rearward due to treadmilling in the same degree as mother ﬁlament and branch grow . Since Arp2 / 3 binding to the individual ﬁlaments is not synchronous we ﬁnd at any time many diﬀerent positions of branch points in the lamellipodium F - actin network . The elastic properties of the F - actin network crucially depend on the density of links between ﬁlaments [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ] . Molecular links arise in two ways : Cross - links connecting two ﬁlaments at some point along their contour length are formed by cross - linker molecules like ﬁlamin or α - actinin , and branching attaches the minus end of a ﬁlament laterally to a mother ﬁlament . Intuition suggests that branching alone could stiﬀen the network to some degree , since branching is a geometrical constraint on the conﬁguration of two ﬁlaments . That intuition has never been quantiﬁed before , but is supported by our results presented below . On the other hand , the network region close to the leading edge was found to be as soft as weakly cross - linked actin networks [ 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ] , and experiments in actin solutions suggest that branching contributes very little to the elastic modulus of F - actin networks [ 14 ] . Here , we would like to present a ﬁrst step in quantifying the contribution of branching to the elastic and semi - ﬂexible properties of the lamellipodial F - actin network . How much stiﬀer than single ﬁlaments are branched ﬁlaments ? How are their properties reﬂected in network behavior ? We will answer these questions by investigating a single branched ﬁlament and Mechanical properties of branched actin ﬁlaments 3 networks of branched structures in an approximation neglecting interactions between them in order to focus on branching eﬀects . This neglect of interactions implies that we consider only elastic properties on short time scale and not the visco - elastic properties arising from cross - linking . The mother ﬁlament is grafted at one end and has a free tip at the other one in our model system ( see Fig . 1 ) . The graft is provided by a highly cross - linked part of the F - actin network . This idea is based on the increasing degree of cross - linking and ﬁlament bundling towards the rear of the lamellipodium , which has been observed in many diﬀerent experiments and simulations [ 5 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ] ( see [ 24 ] for a detailed discussion ) . The graft moves in the direction of cell motion due to cross - linker binding and bundling , and thus contour length ’ﬂows’ into the graft . In the steadily moving cell , the balance between polymerization and cross - linking creates a stationary distance between graft and leading edge membrane . At any time , the branched structure is in a conﬁguration similar to Fig . 1 , but the branch point moves with treadmilling towards the graft point . Both mother ﬁlament and branch polymerize such that their barbed ends stay at the leading edge membrane . Consequently , we will vary the position of the branch point on the mother ﬁlament from 0 to its full length L when we investigate the elastic properties . We model the ﬁlaments in the weakly bending regime , i . e . bending does not aﬀect the end - to - end distance . We allow for an elastic graft of stiﬀness K s and model the membrane by a constraint , enforcing the ﬁlaments to be entirely on the left side of the membrane . After the introduction of the model , we will discuss results for a single branched ﬁlament . The F - actin network in the lamellipodium comprises ﬁlaments with many diﬀerent tilt angles and branch point positions . Hence , we consider it as an ensemble of branched structures with varying branch point and tilt angle and calculate its properties as the average over this ensemble . The network average of the force will be compared to experimental results from force - velocity measurements and the force of unbranched networks . 2 . Results 2 . 1 . The model : semiﬂexible branched ﬁlaments in the weakly bending limit We model the interior of the lamellipodium as a two - dimensional space , since it is approximately ﬂat as described above . Furthermore , the results are easily generalised to three dimensions . We always assume a suﬃciently large persistence length , such that the weakly bending approximation applies and the ﬂuctuations perpendicular to the mean orientation of the polymer segment are small and can be treated on a Gaussian level . Our elemental structure is a grafted ﬁlament of contour length L . The probability to ﬁnd its tip at position ( x , y ) with orientation θ , given that it is grafted at ( x 0 , y 0 ) with orientation ω is denoted by G L ( x , y , θ | ( x 0 , y 0 , ω ) . For the simple case of perpendicular Mechanical properties of branched actin ﬁlaments 4 Figure 1 . Left : Single branched ﬁlament grafted on a soft graft and conﬁned in the x - direction by a ﬂat membrane . Thermal bending ﬂuctuations are not shown in this drawing . L 1 is the contour length between graft point and branch point , L 3 is the contour length between branch point and ﬁlament tip . The contour length of the mother ﬁlament is L = L 1 + L 3 , L b is the branch contour length . The branch angle is γ = 70 ◦ throughout the study , and ω is the tilt angle . The numbers 1 , 2 and 3 refer to the ﬁlament tip coordinates in Eq . 7 . Right : Network of branched ﬁlaments with various orientations and locations of branch points . The length δ 0 is the distance of the ﬁlament tips from the graft plane without bending and ﬂuctuations . The lengths L and L b obey L = δ 0 cos ( ω ) , L b = L 3 cos ( ω ) cos ( ω − γ ) , and δ denotes the distance between the graft point and the leading edge membrane . grafting , ω = 0 , at ( x 0 , y 0 ) = ( 0 , 0 ) , G L obeys [ 25 ] G L ( x , y , θ | 0 , 0 , 0 ) ∝ exp [ − 3 l p L 3 ( y 2 − Lyθ + L 2 θ 2 3 ) ] δ ( x − L ) . ( 1 ) The general case is obtained by a translation and rotation according to θ → θ − ω y → ( y − y 0 ) cos ω − ( x − x 0 ) sin ω x → ( x − x 0 ) cos ω + ( y − y 0 ) sin ω ( 2 ) and explicitly given by Eq . 16 . In a ﬁrst step we compute the probability , P t ( x | x 0 ) , that the endpoint of the tilted polymer is at a distance of x − x 0 from the graft point : P t ( x | x 0 ) ≡ Z Z dydθ G L ( x , y , θ | x 0 , 0 , ω ) . ( 3 ) We consider an elastic , ﬂuctuating structure into which the ﬁlament is grafted and hence model it by a ﬂuctuating spring in x - direction with spring constant K s = ( k B T ) K , zero equilibrium length and a distribution of the spring extension proportional to exp ( − ( Kx 20 ) / 2 ) . The stiﬀness of the substrate , K , is assumed to be large as compared to the stiﬀness for transverse ﬂuctuations , K ≫ K ⊥ = 2 l p 3 L 3 , of a ﬁlament of contour length L . In this study we take K = 100 2 l p 3 ( L cos ( ω ) ) 3 . The probability P t ( x ) to ﬁnd the ﬁlament tip at x then follows by averaging over all graft point positions x 0 : P t ( x ) = Z dx 0 √ 2 πK P t ( x | x 0 ) exp ( − Kx 20 2 ) . ( 4 ) Mechanical properties of branched actin ﬁlaments 5 The ﬁlament exerts a force on an impenetrable ﬂat membrane at a distance δ from the graft plane ( see Fig . 1 ) . The force originates from the reduction in the number of ﬁlament conﬁgurations due to the constraint x − x 0 ≤ δ imposed by the membrane ; we therefore call it an entropic force . The fraction of conﬁgurations satisfying the constraint is given by Z t ( δ ) = Z dxP t ( x ) Θ ( δ − x ) . ( 5 ) The derivative of Z t with respect to δ is the entropic force [ 26 ] f t ( L , δ , ω ) = k B T ∂ ∂δ ln Z t ( δ ) . ( 6 ) These results for a single grafted polymer are easily generalised to the branched structure shown in Fig . 1 . The probability to ﬁnd the two endpoints at x 2 and x 3 respectively given that the structure is grafted at point x 0 is calculated by the following expression : P b ( x 2 , x 3 | x 0 ) = Z Z Z dx 1 dy 1 dθ 1 G L 1 ( x 1 , y 1 , θ 1 | x 0 , 0 , ω ) × Z Z dy 2 dθ 2 G L b ( x 2 , y 2 , θ 2 | x 1 , y 1 , θ 1 − γ ) × Z Z dy 3 dθ 3 G L 3 ( x 3 , y 3 , θ 3 | x 1 , y 1 , θ 1 ) ( 7 ) The stiﬀness of the graft is again taken into account by averaging over the positions of the graft : P b ( x 2 , x 3 ) ∝ Z dx 0 P b ( x 2 , x 3 | x 0 ) exp ( − Kx 20 2 ) ( 8 ) The explicit expression for P b ( x 2 , x 3 ) is given by Eq . 22 in the Appendix . The fraction of conﬁgurations satisfying the constraint obeys in analogy to Eq . 5 Z b ( δ ) = Z dx 2 Z dx 3 P b ( x 2 , x 3 ) Θ ( δ − x 2 ) Θ ( δ − x 3 ) , ( 9 ) and the entropic force follows from f b ( L , L b , L 3 , δ , ω ) = k B T ∂ ∂δ ln Z b ( L , L b , L 3 , δ , ω ) . ( 10 ) The force f b depends on the parameters L ≡ ( L 1 + L 3 ) , L 3 , ω and δ ( L b is ﬁxed by ω , L and L 3 ) . We will present our results as dimensionless quantities , and scale lengths by δ 0 and force by k B T / δ 0 for that purpose . We comment on which speciﬁc values of parameters are suggested by experimental observations in the Discussion and the Appendix below . Mechanical properties of branched actin ﬁlaments 6 Figure 2 . Left panel : force versus relative distance , δ / δ 0 , between membrane and graft point for the symmetric case ω = 35 ◦ and L 3 = L b = L 2 . Right panel : force versus tilt angle ω for δ = δ 0 . The curves represent the ratio of l p δ 0 = 10 , 5 and 103 from top to bottom in both ﬁgures . 2 . 2 . Properties of single branched ﬁlaments The entropic force exerted by the branched ﬁlament on the membrane is shown in the left panel of Fig . 2 for the symmetric case ω ∼ 35 ◦ and branching at the midpoint of the mother ﬁlament . The force decreases with increasing distance δ between grafting plane and membrane . An inﬁnitely stiﬀ ﬁlament ( l p very large ) would just touch the membrane , if δ equals δ 0 = L cos ω . But the force exerted by a semiﬂexible ﬁlament is nonzero even for δ > δ 0 , because the tilted branched structure exhibits ﬂuctuations with the endpoint reaching beyond δ 0 . In this regime the force is nearly independent of persistence length , whereas for δ < δ 0 we observe a strong increase with l p . The force exerted by the ﬁlament on the membrane is crucially aﬀected by the tilt angle . It is plotted as a function of tilt angle ω for ﬁxed δ = δ 0 in the right panel of Fig . 2 . Remarkably , there is a shoulder in all three curves around ω ∼ 35 ◦ , indicating that the symmetric structure generates comparatively large forces . For ω → 0 , the force would diverge for a stiﬀ graft , since Eq . 1 excludes longitudinal ﬂuctuations of the ﬁlament tip . The high but ﬁnite stiﬀness of the graft limits the force which can be exerted on the membrane . These two opposite eﬀects generate the maximum in the force close to ω = 0 . Figure 3 shows the entropic force of a branched structure for the whole range of branch point positions on the mother ﬁlament . At the time of Arp2 / 3 binding to the mother ﬁlament ( L b = 0 ) , the complete structure has of course the properties of the mother ﬁlament . When the branch point has reached the graft plane , the branched structure corresponds to two ﬁlaments with the corresponding tilt angles . In between , the force has a maximum at L b = 0 . 484 L . The maximum force is about 2 . 25 times the force of two ﬁlaments with length L . For the special case under consideration , δ = δ 0 , the maximum of the force scales like the square root of l p , as shown in the right panel of Fig . 3 . For the compressed case , δ < δ 0 , we observe a crossover to linear scaling . To understand this behaviour of the force , we consider the case of a single ﬁlament : The Mechanical properties of branched actin ﬁlaments 7 Figure 3 . Left : force versus relative length of the daughter branch . Below : the conﬁgurations of the branched ﬁlament corresponding to L b / L = 0 , 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 . The parameter values are : L 3 = L b , ω = 35 ◦ , δ = δ 0 . From high to low force values the symbols represent the ratio of l p δ 0 = 10 , 5 and 103 , respectively . Right : log - log plot of the maximum force as a function of persistence length l p , ﬁtted to a square root dependence f max ∝ p l p . force has a thermal ( entropic ) and a nonthermal ( energetic ) contribution . The thermal force dominates for δ > δ 0 . Evaluating the force given in Eq 21 for δ = δ 0 and large K , we explicitly see f ∝ p l p . As we compress the ﬁlament the energetic force becomes the dominant contribution . It can be computed as the force to bend a grafted cantilever beam resulting in f = ( 3 l p k B T 2 L 3 ) ( δ − L cos ( ω ) ) sin 2 ( ω ) . Hence we observe a crossover from the scaling of the force with p l p to linear scaling as δ is decreased below δ 0 Both , the maximum force , f max , as well as its branch point position , L maxb , depend on the tilt angle ω . The general dependence on ω is shown in the top left panel of Fig . 4 for f max and in the top right panel for L maxb . Since the dependencies are nonmonotonic , we plot in the bottom panel the conﬁgurations which give rise to the maximum force and help to understand the non - monotonic dependence . For very small ω , i . e . almost perpendicular grafting , L maxb is very small and hence also the distance between the branch point and the endpoint of the mother ﬁlament , denoted by L max 3 . As the tilt angle , ω , increases , the branch point moves further away from the leading edge membrane and hence both , L maxb and L max 3 increase . As ω approaches 70 ◦ , the branch is almost perpendicular to the membrane and the maximum force is obtained for branching at the grafting plane , implying L max 3 = L . Plotting L maxb / L as in the top right panel of Fig . 4 , one actually observes a decrease of L maxb / L , because L grows faster than L maxb as ω → 70 ◦ . L max 3 is independent of the persistence length , but does depend on δ . For Mechanical properties of branched actin ﬁlaments 8 Figure 4 . Upper left : Maximum of the force f max obtained by varying L b , versus tilt angle ω ; we have δ = δ 0 for the curves . From high to low force values the curves represent the ratio of l p δ 0 = 10 , 5 and 103 , respectively . Upper right : Relative branch length L max b / L of the maximum force versus tilt angle ω for the same parameters ( independent of the persistence length l p ) . Bottom : Relative partial contour length of the mother ﬁlament in between the endpoint and the branch point with maximal force L max 3 = L max b cos ( ω − γ ) / cos ω ; also shown are three representative conﬁgurations . δ ≥ δ 0 entropic contributions dominate and the force is largest for two independently ﬂuctuating ﬁlaments , such that L max 3 / L quickly approaches 1 as δ extends beyond δ 0 . On the other hand , for δ < δ 0 , elastic contributions are important . In the symmetric case , we ﬁnd 0 . 435 ≤ L max 3 / L ≤ 0 . 484 for 0 . 5 ≤ δ / δ 0 ≤ 1 . 0 . The maximum force is observed for ω ∼ 0 and ω ∼ 70 ◦ , because either the mother ﬁlament or the daughter ﬁlament are perpendicular to the membrane ( upper left panel of ) . When the branch is perpendicular , the force is mainly determined by the ﬂuctuations of the branch point , and when the mother ﬁlament is perpendicular by the ﬂuctuations of the graft point . Moving away from perpendicular incidence the force has to decrease , giving rise to a minimum for intermediate ω .

The squares refer to the random network with a uniform orientation distribution in the range − 70 ◦ ≤ ω ≤ 70 ◦ as measured in ref . [ 27 ] , the circles show results with a narrow uniform distribution of orientations in 30 ◦ ≤ ω ≤ 40 ◦ , the dots refer to the orientation distribution given by Eq . 13 as measured in ref . [ 28 ] . 2 . 3 . Extension to the F - actin network : Properties of an ensemble of branched ﬁlaments We would like to obtain an estimate of how branching aﬀects the network properties . With the theoretical means set up above and in the spirit of the study , we calculate the force as an average across an ensemble of branched structures , in which all interactions between the branched ﬁlaments are neglected . The ensemble is described by branch point ( L 3 ) and orientation ( ω ) distributions . The branch point is equally likely anywhere on the mother ﬁlament , corresponding to 0 ≤ L 3 ≤ δ 0 / cos ω . The length of the branch obeys L b = L 3 cos ω cos ( ω − γ ) . As far as the orientation of the mother ﬁlaments is concerned , several scenarios have been discussed in the literature . In ref . [ 27 ] , electron microscopy was used to determine the orientation of ﬁlaments in lamellipodial actin networks . The distribution was found to be approximately uniform in the range of angles between 0 Mechanical properties of branched actin ﬁlaments 10 and 60 ◦ with a small contribution between between 60 ◦ and 75 ◦ . We describe it here as a uniform distribution between - 70 ◦ and 70 ◦ . The force for ﬁxed δ 0 averaged over branch point positions and tilt angles is given by < f b ( δ ) > = Z ω max ω min dω cos ω δ 0 ∆ ω ( 11 ) × Z δ 0 cos ω 0 dL 3 f b ( δ 0 cos ω , L 3 cos ω cos ( ω − γ ) , L 3 , δ , ω ) . where ∆ ω = ω max − ω min denotes the range of the distribution . The average force is a monotonic function of both , the persistence length and the distance δ between grafting plane and membrane , as shown in Fig . 5 . We can compare our results with measurements of the force - velocity relation of ﬁsh keratocyte lamellipodia . The forces exerted by the leading edge of the freely running cell immediately upon collision with the cantilever were below the force resolution of the cantilevers [ 13 , 11 , 12 ] , but caused an immediate decrease of leading edge velocity by 1 - 3 orders of magnitude . Hence , the leading edge is much softer than the softest cantilever used in the experiments , which had a force constant of 9 . 1 nN / µ m . If the leading edge had the same force constant , a single branched structure would need to have a constant of about 11 . 8 pN / µ m with 220 ﬁlaments / µ m [ 29 ] and a contact length of about 7 µ m [ 12 ] . The value of δ 0 in the freely running cell was estimated to be ∼ 1 . 3 µ m [ 13 ] , and such a value is also supported by the data in ref . [ 30 ] . Hence , if the leading edge had the same force constant as the softest cantilever , the dimensionless force constant of a single branched structure would be 11 . 8 pN µ m − 1 δ 20 ( k B T ) − 1 = 4748 ( k B T = 4 . 2 10 − 3 pN µ m ) . The values in the right panel of Fig . 5 show that the branched ﬁlaments are much softer on average , which is in agreement with the dramatic velocity drop of the lamellipodium leading edge upon collision with the cantilever . We do not know measurements of the pressure exerted by the ﬁlaments on the leading edge membrane in the freely running ﬁsh keratocyte but can estimate it from our results . Assuming δ 0 = 1 . 3 µ m , l p / δ 0 ≈ 10 , δ / δ 0 ≈ 0 . 8 [ 13 ] we obtain fδ 0 / k B T ≈ 20 and a force per branched structure of 0 . 063 pN . The pressure exerted by the ﬁlaments on the leading edge membrane is in the range of 46 Pa ( with 110 branched structures per micrometer and a lamellipodium height of 150 nm as in [ 12 ] ) . The value of δ 0 decreases during the force - velocity measurement due to a dynamic equilibrium between polymerization and cross - linking [ 13 ] . In the stalled state , δ 0 ≈ 0 . 27 µ m applies ( Fig . S3 of [ 13 ] ) . The measured stall pressure exerted on the leading edge by the cantilevers is 300 - 750 Pa [ 13 ] and 110 - 430 Pa [ 12 ] . These pressures correspond to stall forces of 0 . 045 - 0 . 1125 nN [ 13 ] and 0 . 0165 - 0 . 0645 nN [ 12 ] per micrometer leading edge . The values of fδ 0 / k B T resulting from these force densities are in the range 10 - 70 . That entails δ / δ 0 . 1 ( see Fig . 5 ) in agreement with modelling results in ref . [ 13 ] . To assess the eﬀects of branching on network properties , we calculate the ratio R Mechanical properties of branched actin ﬁlaments 11 of the force exerted by a branched network to the force of an unbranched network with the same angular distribution . We use the same number of ﬁlaments in the unbranched network as there are branched structures in the branched network : R ( δ ) = < f b > 1∆ ω R ω max ω min dω f t ( δ 0 / cos ω , δ , ω ) . ( 12 ) The ensemble averages of branched and unbranched networks with the uniform orientation distribution between - 70 ◦ and 70 ◦ behave very similar under compression ( Fig . 6 , squares ) . This ratio has the remarkable property of depending only very weakly on δ . It is almost independent of the persistence length l p and the graft stiﬀness K as well ( data not shown ) . Hence , the behavior of both networks scales very similar in dependence on these parameters . The ratio is about 2 , i . e . , the average force per ﬁlament tip for a given value of δ is the same for branched and unbranched networks . However , there are obvious qualitative diﬀerences between single ﬁlaments and branched structures illustrated by the non - trivial dependency of the properties of branched structures on the branch point position in Figs . 3 and 4 . Indeed , if we use a narrow orientation distribution around ω = 35 ◦ the value of R increases with increasing compression . Therefore , we also investigate non - uniform measured lamellipodial orientation distributions to investigate whether the dependency of R on the distribution aﬀects the behavior of lamellipodial networks . Distributions peaked either at ω = 0 or ω = ± 35 ◦ have been observed in refs . [ 28 , 31 , 32 ] . The distribution in ref . [ 28 ] , their Fig . 4 , is typical for the measured non - uniform distributions and can be approximated by P ( ω ) = 0 . 008012 (cid:20) e − ( ω − 35 ) 2 2 · 20 . 52 + e − ( ω + 35 ) 2 2 · 20 . 52 (cid:21) ( 13 ) + 0 . 0006907 , − 85 ◦ ≤ ω ≤ 85 ◦ . The dots in Fig . 6 show the results for R . They are very similar to the results for the uniform distribution . Obviously , the width of 40 ◦ - 45 ◦ of the peaks in lamellipodial orientation distributions is too large for an essential eﬀect of branching on the parameter dependencies . 3 . Discussion We investigated the properties of branched ﬁlaments grafted into an elastic graft . Their stiﬀness has a maximum in its dependence on the branch point position . Branched structures with the optimal graft point position can be more than four times as stiﬀ as a single ﬁlament with the same tilt angle as the mother ﬁlament ( Fig . 3 ) , while requiring only 1 . 5 times the polymer length of the mother ﬁlament . The mechanical properties of branched F - actin networks depend on their orientation distribution . With measured lamellipodial distributions , networks of branched structures are about twice as stiﬀ as unbranched networks . The total network force of branched networks scales essentially the same as the one of unbranched networks Mechanical properties of branched actin ﬁlaments 12 with the parameters F - actin persistence length , graft stiﬀness and compression ( δ ) . An intuitive explanation would be , that in the end it is the single ﬁlament behaviour determining the stiﬀness for both unbranched and branched ﬁlaments , since the branch leans on the ( single ) mother ﬁlament when experiencing a force . Our theory considers individual branched ﬁlaments and thus establishes the constitutive relations on which complex network studies including cross - linking can be based . We considered F - actin networks as deﬁned by their geometrical property distributions without interactions of ﬁlaments by cross - linking or entanglement . This implies that we cannot account for visco - elastic properties . A variety of evidences suggests the existence of a region close to the leading edge , where cross - linking is not dominating the network properties and to which our theory directly applies . Measurements of the ratio of number of the cross - linkers to the number of actin molecules in ﬁbroblasts show the existence of a gradient for α - actinin and ABP - 280 / ﬁlamin . The number ratios are low in a region juxtaposed to the leading edge with a depth of about 1 . 5 µ m ( see Fig . 5 of ref . [ 15 ] ) . Svitkina and Borisy conclude from these results and structural information from electron micrographs that the impact of ABP - 280 and α - actinin on ﬁlament cross - linking is likely to be expressed more deeply in the cytoplasm [ 15 ] . Their statement is supported by the immediate response of the leading edge of ﬁsh keratocytes to small forces indicating also weak cross - linking in the network region close to the leading edge [ 13 , 11 , 12 ] . This suggests that while understanding of the visco - elastic properties of the network in the lamellipodium bulk requires taking cross - linking into account , our ensemble average is applicable to a network region close to the leading edge . The reproduction of both the weak and strong force responses of the lamellipodium leading edge measured in force - velocity relations by our network calculations strongly supports that conclusion ( Fig . 5 ) . We did not take contributions from entanglement or excluded volume eﬀects into account when calculating the network forces . This implies that R provides only a meaningful approximation , if these eﬀects are similar in branched and unbranched networks . To the best of our knowledge , that has not been investigated quantitatively yet . We can only provide heuristic considerations in favour of our assumption based on comparing a variety of simulations with and without excluded volume eﬀects with force - velocity measurements . Model networks of semi - ﬂexible ﬁlaments not taking into account excluded volume eﬀects reproduce the elastic properties measured in force - velocity experiments quantitatively [ 13 ] . Schreiber et al . simulated the force - velocity relation of motile cells with rigid rods as model ﬁlaments taking excluded volume eﬀects into account [ 33 ] . They found excluded volume eﬀects to be stronger in branched than in unbranched systems . The model network of Schreiber et al . shows a response to external forces in the force - velocity relation at about 8 nN / µ m [ 33 ] . However , the lamellipodium leading edge exhibits elastic responses to forces smaller than 0 . 05 nN / µ m in experiments [ 13 , 11 , 12 ] . Additionally , bending of ﬁlaments has been observed in lamellipodia [ 27 , 34 , 35 ] , i . e . , ﬁlaments do not behave like stiﬀ rods . Hence , the lamellipodium network is likely to be Mechanical properties of branched actin ﬁlaments 13 in a parameter regime where excluded volume eﬀects are less relevant than suggested by a network of stiﬀ rods . Branching has also been observed with microtubule [ 36 ] . The branching angle varies between 0 ◦ and 90 ◦ , and it is not known , how rigid the connection to the mother ﬁlament is . If the branch is rigidly connected , our results should apply also to these branched structures with the adapted persistence length ( a few millimeters [ 37 ] ) and γ - values . In summary , single branched ﬁlaments with intermediate branch point positions and tilt angles exert larger forces and are stiﬀer than two unbranched ﬁlaments . The stiﬀness of a whole network of branched ﬁlaments is largest , if the orientation distribution is sharply peaked around ± γ / 2 = ± 35 ◦ . For lamellipodial orientation distributions , the stiﬀness of branched and unbranched networks scales approximately the same with a variety of parameters ( Fig . 6 ) , suggesting that the eﬀect of branching on network stiﬀness can be accounted for by rescaling the ﬁlament number of an unbranched network . These results are in agreement with the elastic properties of lamellipodia found in force - velocity measurements with ﬁsh keratocytes [ 13 , 11 , 12 ] . 4 . APPENDIX 4 . 1 . Tilted ﬁlament The Green function of a free semiﬂexible polymer in two spatial dimensions ( see Fig . 1 ) and in the weakly bending limit satisﬁes the partial diﬀerential equation ( PDE ) [ ∂ ∂s + θ ∂ ∂y − 1 l p ∂ 2 ∂θ 2 ] G ( s , y , θ | 0 , y 0 , ω ) = 0 . ( 14 ) The arc length of the ﬁlament contour is denoted s here . The boundary condition lim s → 0 G ( s , y s , θ s | 0 , y 0 , ω ) = δ ( θ − ω ) δ ( y s − y 0 ) ( 15 ) realizes the graft . The solution is Eq . 1 , after a switch from the coordinates ( s , y , θ ) to ( x , y , θ ) . We obtain the Green function for a tilted ﬁlament simply by a rotation : G L ( x , y , θ | x 0 , y 0 , ω ) ∝ ( 16 ) exp [ − 3 l p L 3 ( ( y − y 0 ) cos ( ω ) − ( x − x 0 ) sin ( ω ) ) 2 − l p L ( θ − ω ) 2 ] × exp [ + 3 l p L 2 ( ( y − y 0 ) cos ( ω ) − ( x − x 0 ) sin ( ω ) ) ( θ − ω ) ] × δ [ ( x − x 0 ) cos ( ω ) + ( y − y 0 ) sin ( ω ) − L ] . The probability distribution of the position x of the endpoint follows by integration ( see Eq . 4 ) P t ( x | x 0 ) ∝ exp ( − ( x − x 0 − L cos ( ω ) ) 2 σ 2 t 0 ) ( 17 ) Mechanical properties of branched actin ﬁlaments 14 where σ 2 t 0 = 4 L 3 sin ( ω ) 2 3 l p . ( 18 ) Representing the stiﬀness of the graft by a spring and averaging over all grafting points , x 0 , yields : P t ( x ) = 1 N t exp ( − ( x − L cos ( ω ) ) 2 σ 2 t ) . ( 19 ) Here N u accounts for the proper normalization and σ 2 t = σ 2 t 0 + 2 K . ( 20 ) The entropic force on the wall is then explicitly given by : f t ( δ ) = 2 k B T ( √ πσ t ) exp ( − ( δ − L cos ( ω ) ) 2 σ 2 t ) erfc ( L cos ( ω ) − δ σ t ) . ( 21 ) 4 . 2 . Branched ﬁlament Starting from Eq . 7 and averaging over graft point positions x 0 , we obtain P b ( x 2 , x 3 ) = ( ( det ( M ) ) 12 π ) exp ( η i M ij η j ) , ( 22 ) where η = (cid:18) x 2 − L 1 cos ( ω ) − L b cos ( ω − γ ) x 3 − ( L 1 + L 3 ) cos ( ω ) (cid:19) ( 23 ) and M is a 2 × 2 - Matrix with components M 11 = − l p C [ K ( L 1 + L 3 ) 3 sin ( ω ) 2 + 3 2 l p ] ( 24 ) M 12 = M 21 = l p C [ KL 21 ( L 1 + 3 2 L 3 ) sin ( ω ) 2 + 3 2 l p + 3 2 KL 1 L b ( L 1 + 2 L 3 ) sin ( ω ) sin ( ω − γ ) ] M 22 = − l p C [ KL 2 b ( 3 L 1 + L b ) sin ( ω − γ ) 2 + 3 2 l p + 3 KL 21 L b sin ( ω ) sin ( ω − γ ) + KL 3 1 sin ( ω ) 2 ] , and C = K sin ( ω ) 2 [ ( L 1 + 4 3 L 3 ) L 31 L 23 sin ( ω ) 2 − 2 ( L 21 − 2 L 23 ) L 21 L b L 3 sin ( ω ) sin ( ω − γ ) ] + L 2 b K sin ( ω ) 2 sin ( ω − γ ) 2 [ L 41 + 4 3 ( L 31 L b + L b L 33 ) + 4 L 21 L b L 3 + 4 L 1 L 23 ( L b + L 3 ) ] + 6 l p [ ( L 1 + 1 3 L 3 ) L 2 3 sin ( ω ) 2 − 2 L 1 L b L 3 sin ( ω ) sin ( ω − γ ) + ( L 1 + 1 3 L b ) L 2 b sin ( ω − γ ) 2 ] Mechanical properties of branched actin ﬁlaments 15 4 . 3 . Parameter values The independent parameters of the model are the F - actin persistence length l p , the equilibrium distance of the ﬁlament tips from the graft plane δ 0 , the stiﬀness K of the graft , and the branching angle γ which is ﬁxed by the Arp2 / 3 complex at about 70 ◦ [ 38 , 39 , 40 ] . The branch point position is uniformly distributed and the tilt angle ω according to the above distributions . The tilt angle and δ 0 ﬁx the mother ﬁlament contour length as L = δ 0 / cos ( ω ) . We explained in the Discussion , that a region juxtaposed to the leading edge membrane with a width of 1 . 0 - 1 . 5 µ m is similar to an experimental realization of the network conﬁguration in Fig . 1 , since it is weakly cross - linked . Values for δ 0 suggested by these observations are in the range 1 . 0 - 1 . 5 µ m . Branching will have an eﬀect on network properties in a conﬁguration like shown in Fig . 1 , if most ﬁlaments are branched , i . e . , if δ 0 is larger than the average branch distance . The average branch distance in steadily moving cells has been a matter of debate in recent years . Svitkina et al . concluded 20 - 50 nm from early electron micrographs of lamellipodia from Xenopus keratocytes and ﬁbroblasts [ 15 ] , and 50 - 200 nm from another study in ﬁbroblasts [ 41 ] . Later measurements substantially increased that value . The average branch distance has been determined to be about 800 nm for B16 melanoma cells and ﬁsh keratocytes in ref . [ 35 ] . Other studies provide number densities of branch points per lamellipodium area for 3T3 ﬁbroblasts . Calculating the average branch distance from that branch point density implies assumptions on the F - actin concentration . The number of ﬁlaments per micrometer lamellipodium width in a distance of 0 . 1 - 1 µ m from the leading edge is 170 - 190 [ 29 ] . Taking into account that ﬁlament orientation is approximately uniformly distributed between 0 ◦ and 60 ◦ [ 27 ] , this density means 1 . 16 ( 170 - 190 ) µ m ﬁlament contour length per µ m 2 lamellipodium area . The factor 1 . 16 arises from averaging over all tilt angles of the ﬁlaments . Yang and Svitkina measured 277 branch points / µ m 2 [ 40 ] in the same sample , i . e . an average branch point distance in terms of contour length between 700 nm and 800 nm . Small et al . measured less than 225 branch points / µ m 2 [ 30 ] , i . e . an average distance of more than 860 nm . The in vivo persistence length is not known . We can only conclude a reasonable range from in vitro measurements . Results from ﬂuctuation analysis and measurements of network elastic properties yield values of the in vitro persistence length of 15 - 18 µ m [ 37 , 42 , 9 , 43 ] . The ﬁlaments in these experiments were stabilized with phaloidin which most likely increases the value of l p . Filaments labeled with rhodamine but not stabilized with phaloidin exhibited values of l p between 9 µ m and 13 . 5 µ m [ 43 ] . The in vivo persistence length might be even shorter , since coﬁlin can substantially reduce it even down to 2 . 2 µ m [ 44 , 45 ] .
