The role of language in acquiring object kind concepts in infancy Fei Xu Department of Psychology , 125 Nightingale Hall , Northeastern University , Boston , MA 02115 , USA Received 25 April 2001 ; received in revised form 18 January 2002 ; accepted 29 May 2002 Abstract Four experiments investigated whether 9 - month - old infants could use the presence of labels to help them establish a representation of two distinct objects in a complex object individuation task . We found that the presence of two distinct labels facilitated object individuation , but the presence of one label for both objects , two distinct tones , two distinct sounds , or two distinct emotional expres - sions did not . These ﬁndings suggest that language may play an important role in the acquisition of sortal / object kind concepts in infancy : words may serve as “essence placeholders” . Implications for the relationship between language and conceptual development are discussed . q 2002 Elsevier Science B . V . All rights reserved . Keywords : Language ; Object kind concepts ; Infancy 1 . Introduction What is the relationship between language and thought ? This question has intrigued psychologists and philosophers for decades ( Brown , 1976 ; Carey , 1994 ; Gopnik & Meltz - off , 1997 ; Nelson , 1996 ; Quine , 1960 ; Whorf , 1956 ; among others ; see Bloom & Keil , 2001 , for a review ) . Contemporary discussions of the issue often begin with Whorf and Sapir , who advocated a radical version of linguistic determinism : the linguistic distinc - tions made in each language determine the conceptual distinctions made by speakers of that language . This strong Whorﬁan view has long been abandoned on both theoretical and empirical grounds . Many have argued that the position is conceptually incoherent ( Fodor , 1975 ; Pinker , 1994 ) and empirical studies have shown that speakers of languages that mark different linguistic distinctions can nevertheless make the same conceptual distinc - tions . For example , color perception in Dani is fundamentally similar to ours even though Dani language only has two color terms ( Heider , 1972 ; Rosch , 1975 , 1978 ; see Brown , F .
