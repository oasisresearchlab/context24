(cid:129) Arp2 / 3 is critical for platelet lamellipodia formation and spread - ing , but plays a minor role for platelet adhe - sion and hemostasis . Actin reorganization regulates key processes in platelet activation . Here we examined the role of the Arp2 / 3 complex , an essential component in actin ﬁ lament branching , in platelet function . The Arpc2 gene , encoding the p34 subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex , was deleted in the megakaryocyte lineage ( Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre ) . Deletion of the Arp2 / 3 complex resulted in marked microthrombocytopenia in mice , caused by premature platelet release into the bone marrow compartment and impaired platelet survival in circulation . Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre platelets exhibited alterations in their actin cytoskeleton and their peripheral microtubule coil . Thrombocytopenia was alleviated following clodronate liposome - induced macrophage depletion in Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice . Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre platelets failed to spread and showed a mild defect in integrin activation and aggregation ; however , no signi ﬁ cant differences in hemostasis or thrombosis were observed between Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre and control mice . Thus , Arp2 / 3 is critical for platelet homeostasis but plays only a minor role for vascular hemostasis . Introduction The Arp2 / 3 complex is key to branched actin network formation . It consists of 7 subunits , including Arpc2 , a subunit critical to proper expression of the entire complex . 1 In resting cells , the Arp2 / 3 complex is mostly found in the cytoplasm . Upon cellular stimulation , it translocates to the periphery , where it nucleates new actin branches from existing actin filaments . The activation of Arp2 / 3 is dependent on nucleation pro - moting factors ( NPFs ) such as members of the WASp and WAVE / SCAR families . Consistent with its key role in actin branching , cells lacking Arp2 / 3 show defects in lamellipodia formation and haptotaxis . 2 , 3 The Arp2 / 3 complex and NPFs of the WASp and WAVE / SCAR families are also expressed in blood platelets , 4 , 5 anucleated cells critical for the integrity of the vascular system ( hemostasis ) . Platelets derive from megakaryocytes , cells found in the bone marrow and the spleen . During the process of thrombopoiesis , megakaryocytes undergo rapid growth , polyploidization , and formation of the demarcation membrane system before forming proplatelet processes , which fragment into platelets . 6 Cytoskeletal rearrangement is critical during megakaryocyte maturation , as evidenced by the fact that disruption of microtubules or F - actin dynamics results in profound defects in proplatelet formation . 7 Once released into the bloodstream , platelets can circulate in a nonadhesive state for ; 10 and 5 days in humans and mice , respectively , unless they are consumed by the hemostatic process . Platelet homeostasis ( ie , the maintenance of a defined platelet count ) depends on the tight regulation of both platelet production and platelet clearance .

Patients with mutations in WASp suffer from Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome and present with a variety of immunological disorders as well as spontaneous bleeding and bruising consequent to a marked microthrombocytopenia ( ; 80 % of patients with platelet counts , 50 3 10 9 / L compared with healthy controls , 150 - 400 3 10 9 / L ) 9 and a mild defect in platelet function . 10 With regard to the platelet count , a milder phenotype ( ; 50 % to 70 % compared with controls ) was described for mice lacking WASp . 11 , 12 Both increased platelet clearance and aberrant platelet release into the bone marrow were shown to contribute to the thrombocytopenia observed in WASp mutant mice . 12 , 13 Just as in humans , integrin inside - out activation and adhesion of platelets from mice lacking functional WASp are only minimally impaired . 14 Hemostasis is largely intact in WASp mutant mice . Interestingly , studies in human and mouse platelets demon - strated that actin assembly and activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex can occur in the absence of WASp , suggesting that the Cdc42 - WASp - Arp2 / 3 axis is not functional in these cells . 15 , 16 The con - tribution of WAVE / SCAR family proteins to platelet function is also not well characterized . Genetic knockout of WAVE2 , the pre - dominant isoform in platelets and megakaryocytes , leads to early embryonic lethality in mice . 17 Mice deficient in WAVE1 are viable and their platelets show a defect in spreading and integrin activation only when activated via the collagen receptor , GPVI . 18 Mice deficient in Arp2 / 3 also die during embryonic development . 19 Using blocking antibodies in platelet extracts and in permeabilized platelets , Li et al suggested that Arp2 / 3 is critical for actin polymerization and both filopodia and lamellipodia formation in platelets . 4 The true impact of Arp2 / 3 on platelet homeostasis and platelet function , however , could not be established with this limited assay system . In the present study , we generated mice lacking Arp2 / 3 in the megakaryocyte lineage ( Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre ) to investigate its contribu - tion to platelet homeostasis and function . Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice exhibited a marked reduction in the peripheral platelet count , caused by impaired platelet release and increased platelet clearance mediated by macrophages of the reticulo - endothelial system . Surprisingly , hemostatic plug formation was intact in Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice even though knockout platelets exhibited mild defects in integrin - mediated adhesion and significant defects in lamellipodia formation . Materials and methods Mouse strains Mice with conditional Arpc2 alleles ( Arpc2 fl / fl ) on a mixed genetic background 20 were crossed with C57BL / 6 mice expressing platelet factor 4 promoter - driven Cre - recombinase ( PF4 - Cre ) to generate mice lacking expression of p34 in megakaryocytes and platelets ( Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre ) . All mouse experiments were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . Mice were provided with food and water ad libitum . Platelet preparation Blood was drawn with heparin - coated capillaries from the retro - orbital plexus into tubes containing low - molecular - weight hepa - rin . Platelet - rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 100 g for 5 minutes and centrifuged at 700 g for 5 minutes at room tem - perature in the presence of 1 m g / mL prostacyclin . Pelleted plate - lets were resuspended in modified Tyrode ’ s buffer ( 137 mM NaCl , 0 . 3 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM KCl , 12 mM NaHCO 3 , 5 mM N - 2 - hydroxyethylpiperazine - N 9 - 2 - ethanesulfonic acid , and 5 mM glu - cose ; pH 7 . 3 ) containing 1 mM CaCl 2 . Platelet spreading assay Washed platelets were adjusted to 2 3 10 7 / mL in Tyrode ’ s buffer ( 1 0 . 35 % bovine serum albumin [ BSA ] 1 2 mM CaCl 2 ) and seeded on human fibrinogen coated coverslips ( 100 m g / mL ) for 10 minutes before addition of agonists . Cells were fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde after 30 minutes , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and stained with phalloidin - 594 . Resting platelets were fixed in suspension and plated on poly - L - lysine – coated coverslips . Resting platelets were also stained with anti – b - tubulin ( clone E7 , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , University of Iowa ) . Samples were analyzed on a Nikon Ti - U inverted microscope ( Nikon Instruments Inc . , Melville , NY ) equipped with a Retiga EXL monochrome camera ( QImaging , Surrey , Canada ) . Images were acquired using Slidebook 5 . 0 ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations , Denver , CO ) and a 100 3 oil objective . Cell surface area was quantified using Image J image analysis software . Quantification of F - actin and G - actin Washed platelets were resuspended at 2 . 5 3 10 7 / mL in Tyrode ’ s buffer ( 0 . 35 % BSA , 1 mM CaCl 2 ) . Platelets were activated with Par4 - activating peptide ( Par4p ) or convulxin ( Cvx ) for 10 minutes before fixation in 2 % formaldehyde and permeabilization in 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 . F - actin was labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 - conjugated phalloidin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) ; G - actin was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated deoxyribonuclease I ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Samples were analyzed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences , Ann Arbor , MI ) . Platelet depletion and recovery assay Thrombocytopenia was induced in mice by intravenous injection of antibodies against platelet surface receptor , GPIb a ( Emfret Analyt - ics ) ( 0 . 2 m g / g body weight ) 3 ( platelet count at baseline / average platelet count in control mice ) . Peripheral platelet counts were assessed by flow cytometry 1 hour after antibody administration and every 24 hours thereafter for 96 hours . Platelet lifespan assays Endogenous platelets . Platelets were labeled in vivo by a single intravenous injection of 2 . 5 m g Alexa Fluor 647 – conjugated anti - GPIX antibody in 100 m L phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) at t 5 2 1 hour . Whole blood ( 50 m L ) was drawn at t 5 0 and every 24 hours thereafter , diluted , and incubated with a phycoerythrin ( PE ) - conjugated antibody to GPIb a for 10 minutes at room temper - ature . The percentage of Alexa Fluor - 647 – positive platelets within the PE - positive platelet population was determined . Data were normalized to t 5 0 hour . Transfused platelets . Washed platelets were obtained from heparinized blood and labeled for 15 minutes with Alexa Fluor 647 – conjugated or Alexa Fluor 488 – conjugated a - GPIX antibody . Following a brief wash , labeled control and Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre plate - lets were combined and 2 3 10 8 platelets were intravenously injected into recipient wild - type mice . Blood collection and counterstaining were done as described previously . 8 AUGUST 2017 x VOLUME 1 , NUMBER 18 Arp2 / 3 IN PLATELET HOMEOSTASIS AND FUNCTION 1399 Phosphatidyl serine exposure assay Washed platelets were adjusted to 3 3 10 8 / mL in Tyrode ’ s buffer . Calcium stress was initiated by addition of 4 mM CaCl 2 . At t 5 0 and every 15 minutes thereafter , a 2 - m L aliquot of platelets was stained with Alexa Fluor 647 – conjugated Annexin V and Alexa Fluor 488 – conjugated anti - GPIX antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry . Phagocytosis assay Washed platelets were labeled with calcein green AM ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and incubated with cultured RAW 264 . 7 murine macrophage cells . After 30 minutes , the culture wells were washed with PBS and cells were harvested with a cell scraper before resuspension and analysis by flow cytometry . Increased macro - phage fluorescence indicates platelet - macrophage association via direct binding or phagocytosis . Depletion of macrophages with clodronate liposomes Clodronate - liposomes or control PBS - liposomes ( Clodronateliposomes . com , Amsterdam , Netherlands ) were intravenously injected into Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice ( 12 - 16 weeks ) at a dose of 10 mL / kg body weight . Platelet counts were assessed every 24 hours by flow cytometry . Macrophage depletion was confirmed by detection of elevated plasma von Willebrand factor levels , as previously described . 21 Quantification of platelets in bone marrow Bone marrow was flushed from femurs into 1 mL of Dulbecco ’ s modified Eagle medium 1 10 % fetal bovine serum 1 2 mM EDTA and passed through a 70 - m m cell strainer before centrifugation at 700 g in the presence of 1 m g / mL of prostacyclin ( Cayman Chemical , Ann Arbor , MI ) . The cell pellet was resuspended in Tyrode ’ s buffer ( 0 . 35 % BSA , 2 mM EDTA ) and adjusted to 1 3 10 8 cells / mL . A total of 1 3 10 6 cells was labeled with a PE - conjugated anti - GPIb a antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry . Data are expressed as % of total events that are GPIb a - positive and platelet sized . Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of bone marrow Bone marrow was carefully flushed from femurs as a single intact tissue and immediately hybridized with Alexa Fluor 488 – labeled anti - GPIX ( clone Xia . B4 , Emfret ) , Alexa Fluor 647 – labeled anti - CD31 ( clone MEC13 . 3 , BioLegend ) , and Hoechst 33258 ( Roche ) for 30 minutes before washing and overnight fixation in 3 . 7 % buffered formaldehyde . Whole bone marrow tissue was mounted and visualized on a Leica DM4000 Confocal microscope ( Wetzlar , Germany ) . Saphenous vein laser injury Mice ( 12 - 14 weeks of age ) were anesthetized with ketamine / xylazine ( 100 mg / kg and 10 mg / kg , respectively ) and injected with Alexa Fluor 488 – conjugated antibodies to GPIX ( 2 . 5 m g ) to label circulating platelets .

Results Conditional deletion of Arpc2 in the megakaryocyte lineage results in microthrombocytopenia in mice To investigate the contribution of the Arp2 / 3 complex to platelet and megakaryocyte function , we deleted the p34 subunit ( encoded by the Arpc2 gene ) of the complex in the megakaryocyte lineage ( Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre ) ( Figure 1A ) . Western blotting studies confirmed a . 95 % reduction in the expression of p34 in megakaryocytes and platelets , whereas the protein was still present in spleen cells ( supplemental Figure 1 ) and liver ( data not shown ) . Consistent with its key role in Arp2 / 3 complex formation and stability , platelets lacking the p34 subunit were also deficient in Arp2 and Arp3 ( Figure 1B ) . Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice showed normal viability when compared with littermate controls ( not shown ) . As expected , megakaryocyte - specific deletion of Arpc2 did not affect peripheral blood leukocyte or red blood cell counts ( supplemental Table 1 ) . However , Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice exhibited a markedly reduced peripheral platelet count ( PPC ; Figure 1C ) and a significant reduction in platelet size ( Figure 1D - E ) . The ratio of reticulated to nonreticulated platelets did not change ( Figure 1F ) . Loss of Arp2 / 3 affects both platelet production and survival A reduction in the PPC can be the result of impaired platelet sur - vival , defective platelet production , or both . We first investigated megakaryocyte function in Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice . Deletion of Arpc2 in the megakaryocyte lineage led to a significant increase in mega - karyocyte numbers in the spleen and the bone marrow ( Figures 2A - B ) . Ex vivo , Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre megakaryocytes were not signifi - cantly different from control cells with regard to the percentage of cells undergoing proplatelet formation ( Figure 2C ) and megakaryo - cyte ultrastructure ( supplemental Figure 2 ) . Interestingly , however , we observed a significant increase in CD42b - positive platelet - size particles in the bone marrow of Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice ( Figure 2D - E ) , suggestive of premature platelet release into the bone marrow compartment .

Immunofluorescence confocal imaging confirmed the marked increase of extravascular platelets in the bone marrow of Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice ( Figure 2F ; supplemental Video 1 ) . Given the large increase in megakaryocyte numbers , however , it seemed unlikely that the defect in proplatelet release is the only cause for the marked microthrombocytopenia observed in mice lacking the Arp2 / 3 complex . Consistent with this conclusion , platelet lifespan was markedly reduced in Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice ( 24 vs 50 hours in controls ; Figure 3A ) and in wild - type mice transfused with Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre platelets ( Figure 3B ) . To address whether thrombocytopenia is predominantly the result of altered platelet production or increased platelet turnover , we com - pared Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre and control mice for their ability to recover from antibody - induced severe thrombocytopenia ( Figure 3C ) . No significant differences in platelet count recovery were observed between Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre and control mice at 24 and 48 hours after infusion of the platelet - depleting antibody . However , although a continued increase in the PPC was observed in control mice , it plateaued in Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice at t 5 48 hours , a time point where the increase in platelet turnover is most prominent in mice lacking Arp2 / 3 . The size of Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre platelets was signifi - cantly smaller at all time points after antibody - mediated depletion ( Figure 3D ) . Thus , these studies demonstrate that increased platelet turnover is a major contributor to the marked thrombocytopenia observed in Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice . Loss of Arp2 / 3 leads to macrophage - mediated clearance of platelets We next investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying in - creased platelet turnover in Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice . To test whether Arp2 / 3 - deficiency leads to desialylation of platelet surface glycoproteins , we incubated washed platelets from Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre and control mice with fluorescein isothiocyanate – labeled Ricinus communis agglutinin ( RCA ) I , a lectin that binds to desialylated N - acetyl glucosamine residues on membrane glycoproteins . Desialylated N - acetyl glucosamine is a known ligand for the a M b 2 integrin on the surface of macrophages and has been implicated in the enhanced clearance of chilled platelets . 23 , 24 However , we found no evidence of increased RCA binding to platelets from Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice ( Figure 4A ) . Furthermore , no evidence for platelet - bound antibodies , and thus autoimmune thrombocytope - nia , in Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice could be found ( Figure 4B ) . However , Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre platelets were significantly more susceptible to stress - induced phosphatidyl serine exposure during storage in vitro ( Figure 4C ) , suggesting that increased platelet clearance in Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice may be mediated by macrophages of the reticulo - endothelial system ( RES ) . Consistent with this finding , cultured RAW 264 . 7 murine macrophages interacted more readily with Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre platelets in vitro ( Figure 4D ) . To deplete splenic and liver macrophages , we intravenously injected Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice with clodronate liposomes . 25 , 26 Clodronate liposomes , but not PBS - control liposomes , led to a marked increase in circulating von Willebrand factor protein , confirming successful depletion of macrophages of the RES ( data not shown ) . Consistent with our hypothesis , treatment with clodronate liposomes led to a significant increase in the PPC of Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice ( Figure 4E ) . When analyzed in vitro , platelets in clodronate - treated Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice were comparable to those in control liposome - treated Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice with regard to surface expression of important adhesion and agonist receptors ( supplemental Figure 3A ) and their integrin activation response to agonist stimulation ( supplemental Figure 3B ) . Interestingly , platelets in clodronate - treated Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice were significantly smaller than those in Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre 100 La b e l e d p l a t e l e t s ( % o f b a s e li n e ) 75 25 50 0 * * * * * * * * 0 24 48 Time ( hr ) 72 96 B 100 La b e l e d p l a t e l e t s ( % o f b a s e li n e ) 75 25 50 0 * * * * * * * * * * * 0 24 48 Time ( hr ) 72 96 A 30 F o r w a r d s c a tt e r ( x 10 4 ) 20 10 0 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 0 - 1 24 48 Time ( hr ) 72 96 D 15 P l t s / m l b l oo d ( x 10 8 ) 10 5 0 * * * * * * * * 0 - 1 24 48 Time ( hr ) 72 96 C Figure 3 .

Furthermore , the proportion of small platelets after macro - phage depletion was found to dramatically increase in clodronate treated Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice compared with controls ( Figure 4G ) . Thus , these studies provide experimental evidence that the increased platelet turnover in Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice predomi - nantly affects smaller platelets and is mediated by macrophages of the RES . Deletion of Arp2 / 3 results in cytoskeletal changes in platelets and megakaryocytes Arp2 / 3 is best known for its role in lamellipodia formation . Consistently , we observed a marked defect in platelet spreading in Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice ( Figure 5A - C ) . Compared with controls , Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre platelets activated with Par4p , the GPVI agonist Cvx , or adenosine 5 9 - diphosphate , exhibited a marked defect in lamellipodia formation . A similar defect in spreading was also observed in cultured megakaryocytes isolated from Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice ( supplemental Figure 2B ) . F - actin and G - actin were quantified by flow cytometry ( Figure 5D ) in resting platelets and upon stimulation with Par4p and Cvx . Consistent with its role in actin nucleation , the amount of F - actin ( Figure 5DI ) and the ratio of F - actin to G - actin ( Figure 5DIII ) were significantly reduced in acti - vated Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre platelets , even when the reduced size of these cells was taken into account . G - actin levels where decreased only in resting Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre platelets ( Figure 5DII ) . Interestingly , resting Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre platelets also exhibited marked alterations in the peripheral tubulin ring . As shown by transmission electron ( Figure 5E ) and immunofluorescence microscopy ( Figure 5F ) , many Arp2 / 3 - deficient platelets exhibited a smaller size , altered mor - phology , and abnormal tubulin bundles . In addition , ; 0 . 5 % of Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre platelets exhibited a doughnut - like morphology instead of the characteristic discoid shape ( supplemental Figure 4 ) . Loss of Arp2 / 3 has little effect on platelet activation and hemostatic plug formation We next investigated whether loss of Arp2 / 3 affects platelet functions other than spreading . Flow cytometry studies using JON / A - PE , a probe that selectively binds to the activated form of a IIb b 3 integrin , 27 identified only a mild defect in integrin inside - out activation in Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre platelets ( supplemental Figure 5A ) . Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre platelets also showed a mild defect in a - granule secretion ( supplemental Figure 5B ) , but not dense - granule secretion ( supplemental Figure 5C ) . Consistent with the mild integrin activation defect , aggregation of Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre platelets 120 96 72 Time ( hr ) 48 24 0 0 5 10 15 P l t s / m l b l oo d ( x 10 8 ) 20 E * * * * * * * * * * Control - PBS Lip Control - Clod .

No significant differences in the expression of platelet agonist and adhesion receptors was observed , with the exception of GPIX , a consequence of its relatively high expression level and the smaller size of Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre platelets ( supplemental Figure 5D ) . Actin rearrangement downstream of integrin outside - in signaling also plays an important role in the process of platelet - mediated clot retraction , but the contribution of actin branching to this process is unknown . Only a minor , yet significant , delay in clot retraction was observed in Arp2 / 3 - deficient platelets ( Figure 6B ; supplemental Video 2 ) . Together , these in vitro studies suggested a minor role for Arp2 / 3 in platelet aggregate formation and clot stability at sites of vascular injury . To test platelet function in vivo , we subjected Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice to the tail clip bleeding ( Figure 6C - D ) and the FeCl 3 - induced carotid artery thrombosis assays ( Figure 6E ) . No significant differences in bleeding time / blood loss or time to carotid artery occlusion were observed between Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre and control mice . We also quantified platelet adhesion during hemo - static plug formation by intravital microscopy of small injuries to the saphenous vein . No significant differences were noted for the kinetics of platelet accumulation or peak fluorescence between control and Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - cre mice at the site of initial injury or subsequent reinjuries ( Figure 6F ; supplemental Video 3 ) . Given that Arp2 / 3 contributes very little to integrin activation but plays a key role in platelet spreading , we wondered if Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice would be more susceptible to inflammatory bleeding as seen in thrombocytopenic mice challenged by immune complex – mediated inflammation in the skin ( reverse passive Arthus reaction ) . The work done by us and others demonstrated that , in this model , single platelets engage the extracellular matrix via immune - type receptors to prevent hemorrhage . 28 , 29 Interestingly , compared with platelet - depleted mice , Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice were protected from inflammatory bleeding ( Figure 6G ) . These data suggest that platelet spreading does not play a significant role in the maintenance of vascular integrity at sites of mechanical injury or inflammation . Discussion We report here critical new data concerning the contribution of the Arp2 / 3 complex to peripheral platelet counts and platelet function , based on the first genetic approach to knock down Arp2 / 3 in megakaryocytes and platelets .

From work in other cell types , Arp2 / 3 is known to be inactive until stimulated by NPFs , such as WASp and SCAR / WAVE , which themselves are under the control of the Rho GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 , respectively . Once activated , Arp2 / 3 is thought to play a critical role in actin branching and Rac1 - mediated lamellipodia formation , a finding that was confirmed for platelets in studies using inhibitory antibodies . 4 These latter studies also showed a defect in filopodia formation , a process thought to be controlled by Cdc42 signaling , in inhibitor - treated platelets . However , a possible role of the Cdc42 - WASp - Arp2 / 3 axis in platelet filopodia formation is controversial because actin assembly and Arp2 / 3 activation can occur independent of WASp in platelets , 15 , 16 and platelets lacking Cdc42 efficiently form filopodia . 30 Our studies in Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice provide compelling evidence for Arp2 / 3 to operate down - stream of both Cdc42 / WASp and Rac1 / WAVE , as the phenotype of Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice combines some of the phenotypes described for mice lacking WASp , WAVE1 , Cdc42 , or Rac1 ( Figure 7 ) . Similar to Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice , both Wasp 2 / 2 and Cdc42 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice are characterized by marked thrombocyto - penia ( ; 30 % to 50 % reduction in platelet count compared with controls ) , reduced platelet survival , increased numbers of mega - karyocytes in bone marrow and spleen , and dysregulated platelet release into the bone marrow compartment . 12 , 13 , 31 The increase in megakaryocyte numbers in the bone marrow and spleen of Arp2 / 3 - deficient mice is likely caused by the reduced survival of platelets in circulation .

We currently do not have a mechanistic explanation for why defi - ciency in Arp2 / 3 or WASp leads to smaller platelets in circulation . However , we provide here the first evidence that Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre platelets are already smaller immediately after they are released from megakaryocytes into the circulation , whereas they are of normal size when they are released into the bone marrow compartment . One explanation for these observations may be that loss of Arp2 / 3 affects membrane integrity in platelets , causing premature fragmentation of these cells in the microcirculation . The existence of doughnut - shaped platelets in the blood of Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice may support this conclusion . Interestingly , our studies in clodronate - treated animals demonstrate that macrophage clearance mainly affects smaller , morphologically altered platelets . These cells exhibit marked alter - ations in ultrastructure , including a distortion of the peripheral tubulin ring required to maintain platelets in their resting , discoid shape . No evidence for increased desialylation of platelet surface receptors or the presence of platelet - associated autoantibodies could be found . Altered tubulin structure and platelet morphology have recently been shown for mice lacking profilin - 1 , an actin - regulating protein that can interact with the WASp / WASp - interacting protein complex . 34 Future studies will be required to elucidate how loss of Arp2 / 3 is linked to altered tubulin structure and if the change in tubulin observed in platelets from mice lacking Arp2 / 3 or profilin - 1 is causative for impaired megakaryocyte development and / or increased clearance of platelets by macrophages . Consistent with its predicted role downstream of Rac1 , Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre platelets exhibited a marked defect in lamellipodia formation . In megakaryocytes and platelets , WAVE2 is the pre - dominant WAVE / SCAR isoform that could link Rac1 and Arp2 / 3 . 17 Unfortunately , the contribution of WAVE2 to platelet function has not been characterized , as germ line knockout mice are embryonic lethal at E 5 12 . 5 . Studies in megakaryocytes derived from Wave2 2 / 2 embryonic stem cells , however , suggest that the Rac1 / WAVE2 pathway is critical for lamellipodia formation and to a lesser degree megakaryocyte development . 17 Mice deficient in WAVE1 , another WAVE / SCAR family member expressed in platelets , are viable . The PPC in Wave1 2 / 2 mice is normal . Knockout platelets show a defect in spreading and integrin activation only when activated via the collagen receptor , GPVI . 18 Rac1 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice also exhibit a marked defect in platelet spreading , but no defects in platelet production and survival . 31 Importantly , mice deficient in both Cdc42 and Rac1 exhibit defects in both platelet production / survival and spreading ( ie , a phenotype that closely resembles that of Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice ) . In addition to its role in spreading , Rac1 in stimulated platelets is also critical for the activation of phospholi - pase C and the generation of second messengers involved in integrin activation . 35 It is thus not surprising that platelet activation and hemostatic plug formation are markedly impaired in Rac1 fl / fl PF4 - Cre and Rac1 / Cdc42 - DKO mice . Consistent with its specific role in actin branching and platelet spreading , deletion of Arp2 / 3 in platelets does not cause significant defects in mice challenged in experimental models of bleeding , thrombosis , and vascular integrity at sites of inflammation . We acknowledge that the resid - ual expression of Arp2 / 3 in platelets from our novel conditional knockout mice needs to be taken into account when interpreting our in vivo data . Based on western blotting studies , conditional deletion of Arpc2 in megakaryocytes leads to . 95 % reduction in Arp2 / 3 expression in circulating platelets . This marked reduction in Arp2 / 3 expression , however , has only a very mild effect on platelet integrin activation in vitro and hemostatic plug formation in vivo . In contrast , platelet adhesion , hemostasis , and thrombosis were significantly impaired in mice with similar reductions in CalDAG - GEFI 36 or Kindlin - 3 , 37 highly expressed proteins critical to platelet adhesion and thrombus formation . Thus , the Arp2 / 3 complex does not seem to be a major regulator of hemostatic plug formation at sites of vascular damage . We also did not observe bleeding at sites of inflammation in Arp2 / 3 mutant mice . Inflammatory bleeding in mice is observed when platelet counts drop to less than 10 % of normal 38 or when platelet immunoreceptor tyrosine - based activa - tion motif signaling is impaired . 28 Vascular integrity at sites of inflammation depends on the adhesion of single platelets to gaps in the endothelial lining , 29 but the molecular mechanisms underlying this response are not well defined . Given this lack of mechanistic understanding and the residual Arp2 / 3 expression observed in platelets from Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice , we cannot fully exclude the possibility that platelet Arp2 / 3 signaling contributes to vascular integrity in inflammation . In summary , our studies in novel Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre mice demon - strate that the Arp2 / 3 complex is important for platelet and megakaryocyte function . More specifically , we show that Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre megakaryocytes and platelets exhibit an expected spreading defect , whereas other platelet responses critical for hemostatic plug formation were only minimally affected . Arpc2 fl / fl PF4 - Cre platelets show marked structural changes that may contribute to their premature clearance by macrophages . The combined phenotype of microthrombocytopenia but largely intact hemostasis strongly resembles that of mice and humans with defective WASp function . Importantly , while this work was under review , the first patients with mutations in the Arpc1B subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex were reported ; in agreement with our murine studies , the clinical phenotype of these patients includes a marked microthrombocytopenia , impaired platelet spreading , and a largely intact hemostatic response . 39 CDC42 WASP ARP2 / 3 RAC1 WAVE2 hemostasis spreading proplatelet release platelet survival integrin activation granule release clot retraction ARP2 / 3 Figure 7 .
