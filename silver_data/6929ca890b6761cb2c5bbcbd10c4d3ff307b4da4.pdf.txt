E . Rall , June 22 , 1987 ( received for review April 9 , 1987 ) ABSTRACT Cholera toxin ( CT ) represents a class of ligands that binds preferentially to noncoated pits on the cell surface . In the present study , we have investigated the mech - anism of endocytosis of this class of ligand and compared it to the classic coated pit mechanism . When either CT coupled to colloidal gold particles ( CT - gold ) or ' 251 - labeled CT were incubated with 3T3 Li fibroblasts at 40C , both ligands bound in a preferential fashion to small noncoated pits on the cell surface . CT - gold surface - labeled cells were then incubated at 220C . The labeled ligand progressively moved into noncoated vesicles and a tubulovesicular compartment composed of a network of tubules and vesicles closely associated with multi - vesicular bodies but distinct from the Golgi complexes . The ligand next passed into multivesicular bodies . By contrast , Co2 - macroglobulin ( a2m ) - gold initially localized preferentially to coated pits and subsequently to coated vesicles and tubulo - vesicular structures before associating with multivesicular bodies . To directly compare the intracellular pathway followed by CT - gold to that followed by a2m - gold , CT - gold ( 7 nm ) was coincubated with r2m - gold ( 15 nm ) . By 10 min of incubation at 22°C , up to 66 % of tubulovesicular units contained both ligands when analyzed in serial sections . Subsequently , both ligands were colocalized in multivesicular bodies . We conclude that CT - gold endocytosed via noncoated vesicles and a2m - gold endocytosed through coated vesicles subsequently associate with the same tubulovesicular units , multivesicular bodies , and lysosomes . Adsorptive endocytosis is a process by which cells selec - tively concentrate and internalize ligands that bind to plasma membrane receptors . In most instances , this process is accomplished through the clustering of receptor - bound fig - ands in clathrin - coated indentations of the cell surface known as coated pits and through the subsequent formation of coated vesicles ( 1 , 2 ) . Recently , however , it has been proposed that some ligands do not bind or cluster in coated pits and are internalized through noncoated invaginations of the plasma membrane . This suggestion was based on the observation that the preferential association of cholera toxin ( CT ) - gold , tetanus toxin - gold , and anti - HLA antibody with noncoated invaginations of the cell surface is followed by the internalization of these ligands ( 3 , 4 ) . The intracellular pathway followed by ligands internalized through coated pits has been extensively studied ; it is now generally accepted that within seconds to minutes coated vesicles are formed , the coat is lost , and larger smooth - surfaced vacuoles with ligand ( endosomes ) are found . Later , the ligand associates with multivesicular bodies and eventu - ally with more typical lysosomes ( 1 , 2 , 5 ) . By contrast , the pathway followed by ligands thought to be internalized through noncoated pits remains obscure . In the present study , we have addressed three questions . ( i ) Does a quantitative analysis involving the use of the same ligand tagged with a different morphological probe confirm that noncoated invaginations are inyolved in receptor - medi - ated endocytosis of specific ligands ? ( ii ) If so , what is the intracellular pathway followed by these ligands ? ( iii ) Does this pathway differ from the pathway followed by ligands internalized through coated pits ? MATERIAL AND METHODS Cell Culture and Reagents . 3T3 Li fibroblasts were gener - ously provided by Ora M . Rosen ( Albert Einstein College of Medicine , New York , NY ) . The cells were grown to conflu - ence in 35 - mm Petri dishes as described ( 6 ) . CT ( Calbiochem ) was iodinated by the chloramine - T meth - od according to Bennett and Cuatrecasas ( 7 ) . a2 - Macro - globulin ( a2m ) was from Boehringer Mannheim . Colloidal gold particles ( 15 nm ) were prepared according to Frens ( 8 ) while smaller particles ( - 7 nm ) were prepared according to Muhlpfordt ( 9 ) . The method used for coupling colloidal gold to proteins has been described ( 10 ) . Incubation Conditions and Processing for Electron Micros - copy . Cells were first incubated for 1 hr at 37°C in serum - free medium to remove most of the cellular bound a2m derived from fetal calf serum , and then washed extensively at 4°C with Krebs - Ringer bicarbonate ( KRB ) buffer containing 3 % bovine serum albumin ( fraction V ) ( pH 7 . 4 ) . The cell tem - perature was equilibrated at 4°C for 15 min . Cells were further incubated in 1 ml of KRB ( pH 7 . 4 ) containing the labeled ligand [ P100 jig of a2m - gold per ml or : 1 . 30 , ug of CT - gold per ml , or = 10 ng of 125I - labeled CT ( 125I - CT ) per ml ] for 2 hr at 4°C . Cells were then washed three times with KRB buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) at 4°C and further incubated for various periods of time at 22°C in the absence of labeled ligand . To determine nonspecific binding ( cell - associated labeled ligand in the presence of excess unlabeled ligand ) , 100 , g of CT per ml or 5 mg of a2m per ml was used . Nonspecific binding was - 2 % for a2m - gold and - 10 % for 1251I - CT or CT - gold ( 11 ) . At each incubation time studied , cells were washed three times in KRB buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) , before being fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde / 0 . 1 M cacodyl - ate buffer , pH 7 . 4 . The preparations were then washed three times in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) , postfixed in 1 % osmium tetroxide in Veronal acetate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) for 20 min at room temperature , and treated with 0 . 5 % tannic acid ( tannic acid AR , code no . 1764 ; Mallinckrodt ) in 50 mM cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 0 ) for < 1 min .

They were then stained en bloc with 0 . 5 % uranyl acetate in Veronal acetate buffer for 20 min , dehy - drated in graded ethanols , and embedded in Epon . Thin sections were cut either parallel or perpendicular to the plane of the culture . Quantitative Analysis . The determination ofthe percentage of gold particles associated with the various surface and intracellular structures considered was carried out on a total of 100 pictures per time point in each experiment . These pictures , printed so as to reach a final magnification of x60 , 000 , were taken on the basis of the first 100 labeled structures encountered in a minimum ofthree different Epon blocks for each condition . Thus , a minimum of 50 different cells per time point in each experimental condition was studied . For each gold ligand analyzed , three different experiments were carried out . When double - labeling experiments were performed , an additional analysis evaluated the percentage of structures labeled with both ligands in terms of the total number of structures labeled . All determinations for quantitative electron microscope autoradiography were carried out as described ( 12 ) . RESULTS Surface Distribution and Intracellular Pathway Followed by CT - Gold . Following a 2 - hr incubation at 40C in the presence of CT - gold ( 7 or 15 nm ) , a large percentage of the surface - bound colloidal gold particles were associated with appar - ently undifferentiated segments of the surface of 3T3 Li fibroblasts , while 15 - 20 % of the CT - gold complexes were found in small noncoated invaginations ( Fig . 1 ) . This obser - vation was repeated by quantitative electron microscope autoradiography using 125I - CT ( data not shown ) , and for both labeled ligands ( CT - gold or 125I - CT ) we found a preferential association with these noncoated pits ( Fig . 2 ) ( ratio of percent labeled ligand associated with noncoated pits over percent cell surface occupied by noncoated pits : 3 . 4 and 4 . 2 , respec - tively ) but not with coated pits ( ratios : 0 . 4 and 0 . 6 , respec - tively ) . Further incubation of the surface - labeled cells at 220C resulted in a progressive increase in the percentage of colloidal gold particles associated with noncoated invagina - tions , which paralleled the decreased association of the ligand with undifferentiated regions of the plasma membrane ( Fig . 1 ) . The association with noncoated invaginations peaked by 10 - 20 min and then plateaued or slightly decreased ( Fig . 1 ) . This surface redistribution of CT - gold was accompanied by a progressive internalization of the labeled ligand , which first associated with vesicles of a similar diameter as noncoated invaginations ( Fig . 2 ) . At later incubation times , the CT - gold progressively accumulated in noncoated vesicles ( which can be distinguished from noncoated pits by the absence of tannic acid labeling ) and the tubulovesicular network ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Since noncoated vesicles could hardly be distinguished from transverse sections of tubules , these two compartments were pooled for the quantitative analysis . The association of CT - gold with this tubulovesicular network reached a maxi - mum by 20 min of incubation at 22°C and then decreased while the ligand gold complexes progressively accumulate within multivesicular bodies ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . A similar sequence of events occurred over an identical time frame when 3T3 Li fibroblasts were incubated with CT coupled to 7 - nm colloidal gold particles or with 1251I - CT ( data not shown ) . These observations validate the use of CT - gold conjugates . When the incubation was carried out at 37°C , a larger percentage of the CT - gold was internalized than at 22°C . Under these conditions , the same structures as the one previously described were involved in the internalization 80 ' ( n ui60 - w 0 C ) 20 ( n X < 60 w H 0 00 U ) cn80 - w - J 0 x 60 - a . 0 - J 0 ~ ' 40 ' z UJ20 ' - 80 - 60 ' 40 ' 20 0 TIME ( MINUTES ) FIG . 1 .

Surface Binding and Intracellular Pathway Followed by a2m - Gold . The sequence of events followed by CT - gold after its binding to 3T3 Li fibroblasts was compared to that followed by a ligand known to preferentially associate with and to be internalized through coated pits , a2m . This ligand was coupled to 15 - nm colloidal gold particles and incubated with 3T3 Li fibroblasts following the same experimental protocol as that described for CT - gold . By 2 hr of incubation at 4°C , the labeled ligand was associated with the plasma membrane where > 70 % of gold particles were found in coated segments ( Figs . 1 and 3 ) . Coated pits were distin - guished from coated vesicles by the presence or absence of tannic acid ( Figs . 3 and 4 ) . When surface - labeled fibroblasts were incubated at 22°C in the absence of ligand , by 1 min of incubation half of the a2m - gold was internalized and recov - ered in coated vesicles ( Figs . 1 and 3 ) . As a function of incubation time , a2m - gold progressively accumulated in a tubulovesicular network similar to that observed in the course of CT - gold internalization . The next intracellular compartment to be labeled included multivesicular bodies ( Figs . 1 and 3 ) . Double - Labeling Experiments . We wished next to deter - mine whether both CT - gold and a2m - gold were conveyed through the same or distinct tubulovesicular unit ( s ) . To answer this question , CT - gold ( 7 nm ) and a2m - gold ( 15 nm ) were concomitantly added to the incubation medium of 3T3 Li fibroblasts . The percentage of labeled structures contain - ing both CT - gold ( 7 nm ) and a2m - gold ( 15 nm ) increased with incubation time at 22°C so that by 10 min when most CT - gold is associated with the tubulovesicular units and when a2m - C C UNDIFFERENTIATED PLASMA MEMBRANE NON - COATEDP P - TUBULO - VESICULAR / SYSTEM , , - _ - ' MULTIVESICULAR ' ' * _ _ - ' BODIES , _ . * * - - 0 3 5 lb 20 30 7958 Cell Biology : Tran et al .

Serial sections of a tubulovesicular unit ( tv ) from a 3T3 Li fibroblast incubated in the presence of both a2m - gold ( 15 nm ) ( large arrows ) and CT - gold ( 7 nm ) ( small arrows ) . Tu - bules and vesicles , which appear labeled with a single ligand in a plane of section , can contain both ligands as demonstrated by serial sections . Note that the cytoplasmic leaflet of the tubu - lovesicular structures is fre - quently underlined by a fuzzy coat . ( a - f , X43 , 000 ; Insets , x79 , 000 . ) gold is still present in this compartment ( see above ) , 15 % of the labeled structures contained both ligands in a single plane of section . This is a minimal estimate since quantitative analysis carried out on serial sections of 75 different tubulo - vesicular units labeled with either CT - gold ( 7 nm ) or a2m - gold ( 15 nm ) demonstrates that by 10 min of incubation , 50 of these tubulovesicular units ( 66 % ) contain the other labeled ligand in a subsequent section of the same intracellular compartment ( Fig . 4 ) . These data support the notion that ligands internalized through coated or noncoated invagina - tions are channeled through the same tubulovesicular units . Morphological Characteristics of the Tubulovesicular Sys - tem . Within 3T3 Li fibroblasts , the tubulovesicular system is composed of several units , each occupying a defined domain of the peripheral cytoplasm . In a single section , a mean of three tubulovesicular units is detected . Each unit is com - posed of an interconnected network of tubules and vesicles closely associated with multivesicular bodies ( Figs . 2 and 4 ) . Partially or totally coated structures of various sizes were frequently present ( Fig . 4 ) . The tubulovesicular units are moreover clearly distinct from the Golgi complexes , which remain unlabeled by both gold - labeled ligands tested . DISCUSSION Morphologically three distinct or partially overlapping types of endocytosis have been identified . These include ( i ) adsorp - tive endocytosis occurring through coated pits , ( ii ) adsorp - tive endocytosis occurring through noncoated pits , and ( iii ) fluid phase endocytosis . Since the classic studies of Ander - son , Brown , and Goldstein , it has become clear that coated pits are a preferential pathway for receptor - mediated endo - cytosis of many different ligands including low density lipoproteins , viruses , and polypeptide hormones . a2m is highly representative of this system ( 1 , 13 ) . The expected behavior of a2m is further confirmed in 3T3 fibroblasts in the present experiments . By contrast , noncoated surface invaginations have been considered as dynamic structures involved in fluid - phase endocytosis ( 2 ) . Recently , it has been demonstrated that these surface invaginations preferentially bound CT - gold , a ligand that binds to GM1 gangliosides ( 14 ) and tetanus toxin - gold complexes ( 4 ) . In the present study , we confirmed this observation and extended it to 1251 - CT . Only 0 . 5 % of surface bound CT - gold particles are associ - ated with coated pits and this small fraction could be internalized through these structures . It is unlikely , however , that coated pits are responsible for most of the CT internal - ized for the following reasons : ( i ) By the end of the 40C incubation 0 . 5 % ofCT - gold complexes associate with coated pits but this association drops to 0 within 1 - 3 min at 22TC . In spite of that , internalization of CT - gold complexes proceeds for 10 - 30 min . ( ii ) We were unable to detect a significant association of CT - gold with coated vesicles at any time studied in spite of the slow internalization of this ligand . By contrast , following internalization , CT - gold complexes rap - idly associate with noncoated vesicles of a size identical to that of noncoated pits . These observations suggest that the t t : . , A : vl . " T4ww ' lo 00 - 0 - - ff . II li Y t t 9 I . 11 T ' - m - , Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 84 ( 1987 ) 7961 small noncoated invaginations to which CT preferentially binds are part of the endocytotic process that mediates the internalization of CT . Endosomes comprise a heterogenous population of vesi - cles and tubules , which are important sorting centers from which materials may be directed to lysosomes , back to the cell surface , to the extracellular space , or to the cytosol ( 1 , 2 ) . Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that ligands utilizing different receptors enter the same coated pits and consequently the same endosome ( 13 , 15 ) . Assuming that the tubulovesicular units represent the endosomes , the present data extend this concept to ligands associated with noncoated pits , which reach the same endosomes as those through which ligands internalized via coated pits are channeled . Endosomes appear to be a meeting point for any material internalized by adsorptive endocytosis . This material is then by unknown mechanisms sorted and routed in the appropri - ate direction . It has recently been suggested that fluid phase markers transit within endosomes together with receptor - bound ligands ( 16 , 17 ) . Subsequent to the endosomal step , both a2m and CT accumulate in a time - dependent manner in the same multi - vesicular bodies . By contrast , no labeling was found in Golgi - associated vesicles or Golgi cisternae at any time interval ( up to 30 min ) . These findings differ from those of Joseph et al . ( 18 ) and Hanover et al . ( 19 ) inasmuch as they reported that horseradish peroxidase - conjugated CT and a2m associate with the Golgi compartment before being delivered to lysosomes . Although it has been suggested that the morphologic probe per se may alter the intracellular location of certain ligands ( 20 , 21 ) , it is unlikely to affect the results presented here : ( i ) because the movement of a2m is similar to what has been seen with other ligands in most cell types ( 1 , 2 , 5 ) and ( ii ) the behavior of CT - gold is qualitatively similar to what was observed with 125I - CT both at the cell surface and intracellularly . The internalization of both CT - gold and a2m - gold is time and temperature dependent with the rate of internalization of both ligands being greater at 37°C than at 22°C . The relative rates , however , are very different inasmuch as a2m is internalized much more efficiently ( i . e . , - 4 times as fast ) than is CT - gold at both 22°C and 37°C . The present study defines the endocytotic pathway of a ligand that preferentially binds to small noncoated invagina - tions on the cell surface . Furthermore , the data demonstrate the high degree of overlap at the earliest identifiable endo - cytotic step between this pathway and the coated pit path - way . These initial endosomal structures are situated in discrete units distinct from the Golgi complexes ; they do not contain lysosomal enzymes ( data not shown ) but are inti - mately associated with multivesicular bodies . Thus , the endocytotic pathways for two different types of ligands are distinct at the cell surface but become more redundant as ligand is transferred intracellularly .
