It exhibits lipid - binding , membrane deformation , and F - actin binding activity , suggesting broader roles at the membrane – cytoskeleton interface . PSTPIP2 is known to participate in macrophage activation , neutrophil migration , cytokine production , and osteoclast differentiation . In recent years , it has been observed to play important roles in innate immune diseases and autoin ﬂ ammatory diseases ( AIDs ) . Current research indicates that the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP - PEST , Src homology domain - containing inositol 5 ’ - phosphatase 1 ( SHIP1 ) , and C ‐ terminal Src kinase ( CSK ) can bind to PSTPIP2 and inhibit the development of AIDs . However , the mechanisms underlying the function of PSTPIP2 have not been fully elucidated . This article reviews the research progress and mechanisms of PSTPIP2 in AIDs . PSTPIP2 also provides a new therapeutic target for the treatment of AIDs . Keywords : proline - serine - threonine - phosphatase - interacting protein 2 , autoin ﬂ ammatory diseases , macrophages , osteoclast , PEST - PTPs INTRODUCTION The concept of “ autoin ﬂ ammatory diseases ( AIDs ) ” was ﬁ rst proposed in 1999 ( 1 ) . AIDs arise from chronic activation of B and T cells of the innate immune system ( 2 , 3 ) , which begin to attack the body ’ s own tissues , causing loss of function in the composite organs and resulting in diseases . And monocytes , macrophages and neutrophils are the main cell types of the innate immune system ( 4 ) . AIDs are characterized by excessive apoptosis , hyperactive in ﬂ ammatory cytokine production , and an overreaction to chemotactic stimuli ( 5 ) , resulting in chronic , systemic in ﬂ ammation . The ﬁ eld of AIDs has become a cornerstone of modern medicine , yet remains a growing area of research .

For example , Familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) is an autosomal recessiveself - in ﬂ ammatorydisordercausedbyamutationinthegene encoding MEFV ( 4 ) . LPIN2 mutation causes Majeed syndrome , characterizedbychronicrecurrentmultifocalosteomyelitis ( CRMO ) ( 6 , 7 ) . More than 60 genes linked to AIDs have been discovered that affect distinct parts of the innate immune system , and it has been found that there are multiple genetic and environmental in ﬂ uences on the development of AIDs , which modulates the phenotype ( 8 ) , such as behcet disease ( BD ) ( 9 ) and adult - onset still ’ s disease ( AOSD ) ( 10 ) . Proline - serine - threonine - phosphatase - interacting protein 2 ( PSTPIP2 ) belongs to the F - BAR family of proteins and coordinates the function of actin in the cytoskeleton , including membrane degeneration , ﬁ lopodia formation , movement , and surface adhesion , and is mainly expressed in macrophages ( 11 ) . Currently , PSTPIP2 has been shown to play important roles in autoin ﬂ ammatory diseases , including chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis ( CRMO ) ( 12 , 13 ) and sepsis ( 14 , 15 ) . PSTPIP2 absence causes autoin ﬂ ammatory diseases , including extramedullary hematopoiesis , as veri ﬁ ed by expansion of macrophage progenitors . PSTPIP2 knockdown mice also show skin and bone injury and mimic human multiple osteomyelitis ( 16 , 17 ) . Recent studies have shown that PSTPIP2 also plays important roles in liver ﬁ brosis ( 18 ) and cisplatin - induced acute kidney injury ( 19 ) , and is a predictive target for many other diseases , such as tuberculosis ( 20 ) and asthma ( 21 ) . PSTPIP2 also inhibits osteoclast differentiation and reduces osteoclast ability to inhibit megakaryocyte differentiation ( 22 , 23 ) . This article will review the study of PSTPIP2 with respect to its roles in in ﬂ ammatory diseases . STRUCTURE AND BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF PSTPIP2 The F - BAR protein was originally identi ﬁ ed as CDC42 - interacting protein 4 ( CIP4 ) . The N - terminal region of CIP4 is highly conserved in other proteins , including tyrosine kinase FES and FES related ( FER ) , which is termed FES / CIP4 homology ( FCH ) domain , also called an EFC ( an extended FCH domain ) that interact with phospholipids , particularly PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , and induce membrane tubulation ( 24 , 25 ) . F - BAR proteins have been considered as important new coordinating proteins that not only regulate endocytosis and phagocytosis , but also the ﬁ lopodium , lamellipodium , cytokinesis , adhesion , and podosome formation ( 25 ) . Existing data indicate that F - BAR proteins are membrane - related proteins that regulate membrane curvature by binding to cell membrane phospholipids , indicating that they have a wider range of effects at the membrane - cytoskeleton interface ( 24 , 26 , 27 ) , and this function is in line with their participation in exocytosis ( 28 , 29 ) , endocytosis ( 26 , 30 – 32 ) and endosomal recycling ( 33 ) . The F - BAR family proteins can also participate in macrophage activation , neutrophil migration , cytokine production , and osteoclast differentiation ( 17 , 23 , 27 , 34 ) . The F - BAR family proteins have been reported to regulate many cellular functions via F - actin assembly ( 11 ) . It has been shown that the EFC / F - BAR domain dimers are joined end - to - end to form ﬁ laments for membrane - varus and endocytosis ( 35 ) . The F - BAR domain can connect the cytoskeleton and cell membrane by binding to the negatively charged membrane phospholipids in the lipid membrane ( 36 ) . Importantly , this oligomerization enables F - BAR family proteins to interact with different proteins simultaneously to form a larger branched protein complex . The mutations in PSTP1P1 and PSTPIP2 have been found in association with AIDs , respectively in human and mice ( 37 , 38 ) . Previous reports have demonstrated that mutations in PSTPIP1 result in human pyogenic sterile arthritis , pyoderma gangrenosum , pyogenic arthritis , pyoderma gangrenosum , and acne syndrome , a dominant autosomal autoin ﬂ ammatory diseases ( 37 ) . PSTPIP1 - associated myeloid - related proteinemia in ﬂ ammatory syndrome ( PAMI ) has been described as a unique clinical phenotype of PSTPIP1 - associated in ﬂ ammatory disease ( PADS ) ( 39 ) . The cmo ( L98P ) and Lupo ( I282N ) mutations of PSTPIP2 in mice lead to macrophage - mediated autoin ﬂ ammatory diseases , including skin necrosis , in ﬂ ammation of the claw and ear , and in ﬂ ammatory bone resorption ( 17 , 38 , 40 ) . Mutations to PSTPIP2 in mice , induced by N - ethyl - N - nitrosourea , lead to phenotypes parallel to cmo and Lupo ( 41 ) . Mice with cmo and Lupo in the early stages of disease exhibited markers of macrophage activation by increasing levels of in ﬂ ammatory cytokines MIP - 1 and IL - 6 ( 16 , 17 ) . Many F - BAR family proteins include the C - terminal Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain , which interacts with proline - rich motifs present in members of the Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family and dynamin ( 26 , 42 – 44 ) . PSTPIP2 lacks the SH3 domain that is indispensable for interaction with WASP compared with PSTPIP1 . Instead , it interacts with the C - terminal homology domain of the PEST family phosphatases ( 45 ) ( Figure 1 ) . PSTPIP2 is phosphorylated by tyrosine under the treatment of colony - stimulating factor - 1 ( CSF - 1 ) ( 45 ) , and it was also effectively phosphorylated after v - Src transfection ( 46 ) . Thus , PSTPIP2 could promote the reorganization and chemical stability of the actin cytoskeleton ( 47 , 48 ) . THE FUNCTION OF PSTPIP2 IN VARIOUS CELLS Macrophages and osteoclasts play important roles in AIDs , and the main roles of macrophages and osteoclasts are shown in Supplement Table 1 ( 49 – 52 ) . The Function of PSTPIP2 in Macrophages Macrophages motility are signi ﬁ cant in a variety of diseases ( 53 ) . Their central roles in biological processes are their ability to migrate , reproduce , and devour . Migration , invasion , and phagocytosis are actin - related cellular activities . It has been reported that mutation of PSTPIP2 gene in mice can lead to the occurrence of macrophage - mediated AIDs ( 16 ) . CSF - 1 is the major growth factor that regulates the development and Xu et al . PSTPIP2 in Autoin ﬂ ammatory Diseases Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 585412 2 maintenance of macrophages in tissues ( 53 – 55 ) . CSF - 1 stimulates the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and is involved in the chemotactic ( 56 ) . The CSF - 1 receptor tyrosine kinase mediates the effects of CSF - 1 ( 57 ) , which in turn mediates the tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous cellular proteins in response to CSF - 1 ( 58 ) , including that of PSTPIP2 ( 48 ) . Macrophages are specialized in rapidly changing shape , migration , and phagocytosis . PSTPIP2 is the major tyrosine - phosphorylated protein associated with F - actin in the cytosolic fraction of macrophages stimulated by CSF - 1 ( 45 , 48 ) . PSTPIP2 was reported to induce the binding of F - actin and its presence on the actin bundles , indicating that it could interact with newly synthesized actin ﬁ laments and package them into bundles in vitro . The orientations and chemotaxis of CSF - 1 are directly proportional to the expression level of PSTPIP2 . Actin bundling is signi ﬁ cant for the formation of ﬁ lopodia ( 59 , 60 ) . Filopodia is thought to affect the direction by acting as environmental sensors ( 61 , 62 ) . PSTPIP2 stimulates an increase in orienteering and chemotaxis , which may partly explain the increased rate of ﬁ lopodia formation ( 27 ) . PSTPIP2 is an actin bundling protein that controls the structure of the actin cytoskeleton , and hence controls the morphology and movement of macrophages downstream of CSF - 1R ( 27 ) ( Figure 2 ) . The coil region may be signi ﬁ cant for the above function of PSTPIP2 because it contains a postulated actin - binding domain and is hypothesized to regulate the oligomerization of PSTPIP2 . FIGURE 1 | F - BAR proteins regulate membrane curvature by binding to cell membrane phospholipids . PSTPIP2 lacks the SH3 domain that is indispensable for interaction with WASP compared with PSTPIP1 . Instead , it interacts with the C - terminal homology domain of the PEST family phosphatases . Xu et al . PSTPIP2 in Autoin ﬂ ammatory Diseases Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 585412 3 The Function of PSTPIP2 in Osteoclasts Bone remodeling is a key process in the development , maintenance , and repair of vertebrates . It involves the synergistic activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts during bone digestion ( 63 ) . An imbalance of activity between the two cell types can lead to disabling illnesses such as osteopenia or osteoporosis ( 64 ) . Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells produced by hematopoietic mononuclear precursors . Bone resorption in vertebrates depends on the ability of osteoclasts to gather F - actin podosomes that coalesce into podosomal belts , forming sealing tapes . Sealing tapes separate bone - facing ruf ﬂ ed membranes from other membranes and disassemble osteoclasts as they migrate to new areas ( 65 ) . Thus , cycles of cell migration and bone digestion are related to the assembly and disassembly of F - actin - rich structures ( 66 ) . It has been reported that PSTPIP2 is highly expressed in the F - actin - rich sealing area , and it can regulate the podosomes to form the sealed area . PSTPIP2 plays important roles in the homeostasis of osteoblasts and osteoclasts ( 63 ) ( Figure 2 ) . PSTPIP2 presents a typical F - BAR domain , which contains proteins that sense the positive membrane curvature and can generate membrane tubules in vitro ( 67 – 69 ) . This structure can also explain the role of dynamin in podosome dynamics . Dynamin is a Src - dependent GTPase that aggregates on the tubular membrane during clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 70 ) . In FIGURE 2 | The function of PSTPIP2 in various cells . In macrophages , PSTPIP2 participate in F - actin bundling , promote the formation of ﬁ lopodia , and then control the morphology and directional migration of macrophages . In osteoclast , PSTPIP2 is highly expressed in F - actin - rich area , and regulate the formation of podosomal belts to promote the decomposition of osteoclast , which plays an important role in the belt dynamic balance of osteoclasts and osteoblasts . Xu et al . PSTPIP2 in Autoin ﬂ ammatory Diseases Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 585412 4 addition to serving as a membrane scaffold , PSTPIP2 is also used as a docking platform for recruiting podosome components in osteoclasts ( 63 ) . PSTPIP2 binds to talin1 , which binds a v b 3 integrin and F - actin , and is critical for bone degradation ( 71 ) . PSTPIP2 can also be used as a docking platform for tyrosine - protein phosphatases PTPN12 and PTPN22 , contributing to the stabilization of podosomes and sealing areas in osteoclasts . ROLES OF PSTPIP2 IN INFLAMMATORY DISEASES Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis ( CRMO ) is an in ﬂ ammatory disease characterized by recurrent fever and bone pain , resulting from in ﬂ ammation ( 6 ) caused by aseptic osteomyelitis ( 72 – 74 ) . CRMO patients are mostly children , and the clinical manifestations are bone in ﬂ ammation , destruction , and deformity ( 75 ) . Plain ﬁ lms can be normal in the early stages of the disease . However , they usually present as sclerosing osteolytic lesions in the long bone around the growth plate ( 76 , 77 ) . It is widely accepted that in ﬂ ammatory immune cells play important roles in the induction and maintenance of various inherited and induced bone diseases ( 78 ) . CRMO is a complex genetic disease and several genes that cause sterile osteomyelitis have been identi ﬁ ed in human and animal models , including PSTPIP2 . The missense mutations in PSTPIP2 leaded to osteomyelitis and osteopathy with bone deformities in mice ( 17 , 23 , 38 ) ( Figure 3 ) . As mice cmo disease , which is similar to the experimental model of human CRMO , is speci ﬁ cally mediated by the high production of IL - 1 b of neutrophils ( 79 ) , an autoin ﬂ ammatory osteomyelitis mediated by caspase - 8 / NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome driven by the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase SYK ( 80 ) . IL - 1 is a major mediator of innate immunity and is considered a major cytokine in local and systemic in ﬂ ammation ( 81 ) . IL - 1 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AIDs . The inhibition of IL - 1 has become a key therapeutic target . In addition , it has been reported that PSTPIP2 can also negatively regulate the ROS generation pathway of neutrophil NOX2 NADPH oxidase . NADPH oxidase dysregulation promotes bone damage of autoin ﬂ ammatory osteomyelitis ( 82 ) . Synovitis , Acne , Pustulosis , Hyperostosis , and Osteitis SAPHO syndrome is a relatively obscure autoin ﬂ ammatory condition ( 83 ) . Most patients with SAPHO syndrome are children and young adults , particularly females ( 84 ) . FIGURE 3 | Possible roles of PSTPIP2 in AIDs . Mutation of L98P in PSTPIP2 caused CMO that similar to human CRMO , and PSTPIP2 - / - mice exhibit an in ﬂ ammatory response similar to SAPHO syndrome . PSTPIP2 can inhibit the activation of FLSs , the production of proin ﬂ ammatory cytokines and the differentiation of osteoclasts , leading to hinder the occurrence of AIDs . Xu et al . PSTPIP2 in Autoin ﬂ ammatory Diseases Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 585412 5 The patient with SAPHO presents with signi ﬁ cant bone and joint involvement ( 85 , 86 ) . The skin lesion of SAPHO syndrome is a neutrophilic dermatosis ( 87 ) . SAPHO syndrome has been associated with CRMO and multiple aseptic in ﬂ ammatory bone lesions ( 88 ) . Although the pathogenesis remain unclear , SAPHO syndrome tends to be familial and is associated with genetic abnormalities , and there is an increasing understanding that SAPHO is similar to other AIDs ( 38 , 89 ) . The discovery of familial clustering cases supported the genetic basis of SAPHO , but no speci ﬁ c mutations were found in SAPHO patients ( 90 ) . PSTPIP2 participates in macrophage activation , neutrophil migration , cytokine production , and osteoclast differentiation ( 91 ) . It has been hypothesized to play crucial roles in innate immune diseases and autoin ﬂ ammatory bone disorders , including SAPHO . PSTPIP2 knockout mice ( PSTPIP2 - / - ) have been reported to develop paw swelling , synovitis , osteoproliferation , and osteitis , similar to SAPHO syndrome ( 91 ) ( Figure 3 ) . Studies have shown that variants rs10889677 , rs2201841 , and rs7517847 of IL - 23R , and variant rs2243248 of IL - 4 , showed strong associations with SAPHO syndrome . Patients carrying the A - G - C - G - T haplotype of IL - 23 are signi ﬁ cantly more likely to develop SAPHO syndrome ( 92 ) . POTENTIAL INVOLVEMENT OF PSTPIP2 IN INFLAMMATORY DISEASES PSTPIP2 is known to play an important role in the development of AIDs , where its reduced or complete loss of expression is the major cause of the diseases ( 16 , 17 , 38 ) . However , the mechanisms controlling the function of PSTPIP2 have not been fully elucidated . As an adaptor protein , it may function by regulating interactions between proteins , inhibitory enzymes , and other negative regulators ( Figure 4 ) . Partial inhibition of PSTPIP2 is mediated by protein tyrosine phosphatases in the PTP - PEST family . These tyrosine phosphatases interact with the central FIGURE 4 | The related mechanism of PSTPIP2 . PSTPIP2 have a N - terminal F - BAR domain and a C - terminal tail . The PSTPIP2 C - terminal can be combined with PEST - family and the inhibition of PSTPIP2 is mediated by protein tyrosine phosphatases located in the central area of PEST - family . PEST - PTPs can bind to CSK through a proline - rich or tyrosine - rich motif in their central region . PEST - PTPs also involves recruiting CSK to PSTPIP2 , which further enhances the independent binding of CSK to PSTPIP2 . SHIP1 binds to the key tyrosine residues at the C terminal of PSTPIP2 . Lipid phosphatase SHIP1 , a regulatory protein , controls the activity of the PI3K pathway via dephosphorylating its crucial mediator , phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate [ PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 ] . This results in the decreased activity of some of its downstream effectors , such as Akt . PSTPIP2 regulate membrane curvature by binding to cell membrane phospholipids by F - BAR domain . F - BAR could bind to actin polymerization factor of actin ﬁ lament . WASP binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex and triggers the formation of a weave of actin comprising branched actin ﬁ laments . And the SH3 domain of PSTPIP1 could interact with WASP . Xu et al . PSTPIP2 in Autoin ﬂ ammatory Diseases Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 585412 6 part of the protein . The only known PSTPIP2 binding molecule in this class is PEST - PTPs ( 23 , 46 ) , which consists of three members : PEP / LYP , PTP - HSCF ( PTPN18 ) , and PTP - PEST ( PTPN12 ) ( 93 ) . All three family members can bind to CSK through a proline - rich or tyrosine - rich motif in their central region ( 94 – 96 ) . Another possible role of PEST - PTPs is the recruitment of CSK to PSTPIP2 , which further enhances the independent binding of CSK to PSTPIP2 . In addition , more evidence supports the importance of PEST - PTPs in PSTPIP2 functionality . These adaptor proteins are involved in the regulation of in ﬂ ammation , and changes in their function lead to the development of autoin ﬂ ammatory diseases ( 17 , 37 ) . For example , mutation of W232A in PSTPIP2 prevents its binding to PEST - family phosphatase , and impairs the ability of PSTPIP2 to restrain the differentiation of osteoclasts and megakaryocytes ( 23 , 97 ) . However , other areas of PSTPIP2 that are not required for PEST - family phosphatase binding have also been shown to be indispensable for PSTPIP2 function . It has been reported that PSTPIP2 can bind to the inhibitory enzymes CSK and SHIP1 ( 98 ) . SHIP1 binds to the key tyrosine residues at the C terminal of PSTPIP2 , which is important for the independent inhibition of PEST - phosphatase in different cellular systems . This region is important for PSTPIP2 - mediated inhibition of IL - 1 b processing in neutrophils , and SHIP1 inhibition led to an enhancement of this process . Lipid phosphatase SHIP1 , a regulatory protein , controls the activity of the PI3K pathway by dephosphorylating its crucial mediator , phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate [ PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 ] . This results in decreased activity of some of its downstream effectors ( 99 ) . A typical example of this effect is Akt , a serine / threonine kinase , which is involved in cell activation , proliferation , metabolism , and survival , and is absorbed into the plasma membrane by PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 for further activation ( 100 ) . There are also ample data to show that SHIP1 negatively regulates the MAPK pathway through various mechanisms ( 101 ) . The protein tyrosine kinase CSK is another key negative regulator of leukocyte signaling . PSTPIP2 is characterized by an N - terminal F - BAR domain that mediates interactions with membrane phospholipids as well as a C - terminal tail containing various interaction motifs ( 102 ) . The F - BAR domain of PSTPIP2 can interact with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ( 24 ) , and its C - terminal could bind PEST - PTPs through an interactive motif including tryptophan 232 ( 23 , 103 ) . The C - terminus of PSTPIP2 contains several unknown functional tyrosine , which are often phosphorylated in macrophages after exposure to M - CSF ( 45 ) . PSTPIP2 de ﬁ ciency results in an increased response to CSF - 1 stimuli , and causes the overactivation of Erk1 / 2 and STAT1 in macrophages ( 16 ) ; Erk1 / 2 is the main regulator of proliferation of macrophages and their progenitors induced by CSF - 1 ( 104 ) . Therefore , PSTPIP2 suppresses in ﬂ ammation and osteoclast generation as a CSF - 1R signaling negative feedback regulator . Overexpression of PSTPIP2 restrains membrane ruf ﬂ ing and formation of ﬁ lopodia , cell stretching , and motility ( 27 ) . PSTPIP2 might play a vital role in the development of AIDs , and knowledge of these mechanisms will be useful for therapies for AIDs . In summary , PSTPIP2 may be a potential therapeutic target for AIDS . CONCLUSIONS Proline - serine - threonine - phosphatase - interacting protein 2 ( PSTPIP2 ) belongs to the F - BAR family of proteins . There is evidence that PSTPIP2 plays an important role in the development of AIDs . The PSTPIP2 cmo mouse strain is a character model for this type of disease . Due to a mutation that resulted in a de ﬁ ciency of the adaptor protein PSTPIP2 , these animals developed chronic in ﬂ ammatory multifocal osteomyelitis , with symptoms are similar to human CRMO . In macrophages , PSTPIP2 can negatively regulate the activation of macrophages and inhibit the release of in ﬂ ammatory cytokines , thereby inhibiting the development of in ﬂ ammation . In osteoclasts , PSTPIP2 plays an important role in the homeostasis of osteoblasts and osteoclasts and participates in osteoclast - induced osteoclasts . This plays a signi ﬁ cant role in the occurrence and development of AIDs , such as CRMO and SAPHO . In addition to macrophages , neutrophils , monocytes , natural killer ( NK ) cells , T cells and B cells also play important roles in autoin ﬂ ammatory diseases ( 4 , 105 ) , and the study of PSTPIP2 in these cells remains to be explored . The mechanisms controlling the function of PSTPIP2 have not been fully elucidated . Partial inhibition of PSTPIP2 is mediated by protein tyrosine phosphatases in the PEST - family , and more evidence supports the importance of PEST - PTPs to PSTPIP2 functionality . It has been reported that PSTPIP2 can bind to the inhibitory enzymes CSK and SHIP1 . Another possible role of PEST - PTPs is the recruitment of CSK to PSTPIP2 , which further enhances the independent binding of CSK to PSTPIP2 . These adaptor proteins are involved in the regulation of in ﬂ ammation , and changes in their function lead to the development of autoin ﬂ ammatory diseases . PSTPIP2 also plays an important role in liver ﬁ brosis ( 18 ) . Overexpression of PSTPIP2 inhibited the expression of M1 markers by suppressing STAT1 activity and enhanced the expression of M2 markers by promoting STAT6 activity ( Supplement Table 2 ) . AIDs are spontaneous in ﬂ ammatory diseases caused by innate immune system disorders . Accumulating evidence suggests that PSTPIP2 of the F - BAR family plays a vital role in AIDs , they may be involved in controlling in ﬂ ammation and the pathophysiology of some autoin ﬂ ammatory syndromes . Actin is a major component of the cellular dielectric structure , and abnormal regulation of the cytoskeleton determines complex clinical manifestations , in ﬂ ammatory manifestations , and immune de ﬁ ciency . “ Actinopathies ” , a new area of AIDs , is a signi ﬁ cant overlap between autoin ﬂ ammation and immune - dysregulation . Autoin ﬂ ammatory periodic fever , immune de ﬁ ciency , and thrombocytopenia ( PFIT ) syndrome are caused by mutations in the actin - regulating WDR1 gene that encodes WD - repeat 1 ( 106 ) . The protein plays a critical role in the dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton . A new monogenic AIDs characterized by IL - 18 hypersecretion have been associated with cytoskeletal abnormalities ( 107 ) . PSTPIP2 exhibits F - actin bundling activity , indicating that it plays a certain role in the membrane – cytoskeleton interface . There is growing evidence that mutations in different genes associated with autoin ﬂ ammation are associated with other Xu et al . PSTPIP2 in Autoin ﬂ ammatory Diseases Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 585412 7 “ neutrophilic diseases ” ( 108 – 110 ) . Pyoderma gangrene ( PG ) is a rare in ﬂ ammatory neutrophilic skin disease that may occur in the context of PAPA ( pyogenic sterile arthritis with PG and acne ) and SAPHO syndromes as well as PASH ( pyoderma gangrenosum , acne and pyogenic hidradenitis ) syndromes ( 108 ) . Two mutations encoding PSTPIP1 gene ( A230T and E250Q ) were found in PAPA patients ( 111 ) , and the absence of PSTPIP2 triggers SAPHO syndromes ( 91 ) . Neutrophil - mediated dermatosis are now considered to be a spectrum of polygenic autoin ﬂ ammation ( 112 ) . From the above , PSTPIP2 is mainly expressed in macrophages and regulates the functions of macrophages and osteoclasts , affecting the occurrence and development of AIDs . PSTPIP2 may be a potential target for the treatment of AIDs , providing a new theoretical support for the treatment of AIDs . And it is speculated that PSTPIP2 may play an important role in actinopathies . Autoin ﬂ ammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases share many similar etiological and clinical features , including genetic susceptibility and recurrent systemic in ﬂ ammatory ﬂ ares ( 113 ) . It has been reported that PSTPIP2 suppressed in ﬂ ammation in autoimmune diseases ( 114 ) . The previous research of our group indicated that adding PSTPIP2 expression alleviated liver ﬁ brosis and hepatic in ﬂ ammation in mice ( 18 ) . PSTPIP2 may be closely related to autoimmune diseases and in ﬂ ammation - related diseases . More information is clearly needed to fully understand the functions , mechanisms , and regulation of PSTPIP2 under normal and pathological conditions . However , there are few studies on the role of PSTPIP2 in AIDs . Therefore , additional research addressing these issues is warranted to better understand PSTPIP2 and to fully recognize the similarity and speci ﬁ city of members of the PSTPIP family .
