Introduction In modern science , peer review has advanced to become the most important instrument for assessing scientific work . [ 1 ] Supporters of the peer review process deem it indispensable , because only active researchers within the same research field – peers – are in a position to assess the scientific quality of their colleagues’ research . [ 2 ] Critics of peer review see as weaknesses of the process that ( 1 ) different referees’ assessments of one and the same piece of scholarly work rarely agree ( inter - referee agreement problem ) , and ( 2 ) recommendations and decisions in peer review show systematic biased judgments , so that the correlation between decision to publish and impact of the refereed manuscript following publication is low ( problem of predictive validity ) . [ 3 , 4 ] The research on peer review , which in recent years has taken up and examined the criticisms of the peer review process , deals for the most part with journal peer review [ 5 - 8 ] and somewhat less frequently with peer review for research and grant proposals . [ 9 - 11 ] For Godlee and Jefferson , “the biggest surprise is how little we know about its workings . For a system that demands ever increasing rigor and levels of proof from scientists , it remains itself remarkably untouched by the rigors of science . ” [ 12 , p . xiii ] Many peer review studies have methodological weaknesses , and “most of the publications on journal peer review are more opinion than research , often the ruminations of a former editor . Likewise , most of the many letters to editors on the topic , the comments of one kind or another are predominantly opinion . ” [ 13 , p . 215 ] The present study examines whether the criticisms of the peer review process is justified at a journal that publishes original research papers . Fifteen years after the study Guardians of Science [ 14 ] ( one of the most - cited publications on peer review ) , we once again examined the quality of peer review at Angewandte Chemie according to the criteria of reliability ( agreement among referees ) and predictive validity , using an optimized study 3 design and modern methods of statistical data analysis . To investigate reliability we determined the degree of agreement among referees . [ 15 ] Judgments are called reliable if there is agreement among several independent referees’ publication recommendations on one and same piece of scientific work . [ 16 ] To check for evidence of predictive validity of the peer review process , studies on manuscript review use , for lack of other operationalizable indicators , the citation counts of manuscripts accepted for publication and manuscripts rejected by a journal but then published elsewhere . [ 17 ] According to van Raan , citations provide “a good to even very good quantitative impression of at least one important aspect of quality , namely international impact . ” [ 18 , p . 404 ] For Lindsey , citations are “our most reliable convenient measure of quality in science – a measure that will continue to be widely used . ” [ 19 , p . 201 ] Scientific judgments on journal manuscripts are said to show predictive validity , if the citation rates of manuscripts accepted for publication and manuscripts rejected by a journal but then published elsewhere differ statistically significantly . [ 14 ] 2 . Methods Angewandte Chemie is a journal of the German Chemical Society ( Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker ( GDCh ) , Frankfurt am Main ) and is published by Wiley - VCH ( Weinheim ) . A Communication ( Zuschrift ) submitted to the journal normally undergoes internal and external refereeing . First , a journal editor evaluates the importance of the Communication for the development of a research area within chemistry ( internal refereeing ) . If in the opinion of the editor it is very important , the Communication is sent to several ( usually three ) [ 20 ] independent external referees , who are requested to make a recommendation on an evaluation form as to whether the Communication should be published ( one of the questions on the form is , “Do you recommend acceptance of the Communication ? ” ) and to explain their reasons for the recommendation on a sheet provided 4 for comments . Based on the referees’ recommendations , the journal editor decides whether to accept or reject a Communication for publication . [ 21 ] For the investigation of peer review at Angewandte Chemie we used information on a total of 1 , 899 Communications that were refereed in the year 2000 . The information was taken from archived material that was stored electronically by the publisher of the journal . By using the Communications refereed in 2000 , we selected a somewhat older manuscript cohort as the database , since for an examination of predictive validity there should be a time interval of several years between reviewing of a manuscript and measurement of the indicator for scientific quality ( here : citations ) . [ 22 ] In addition to the internal review by the journal editor , a total of 4 , 593 external recommendations on the 1 , 899 Communications were made using evaluation forms or comments sheets . On average , therefore , there were 2 . 4 external recommendations available for each Communication . Based on these recommendations , 46 % ( n = 878 ) of the 1 , 899 Communications were accepted for publication in Angewandte Chemie , and 54 % ( n = 1 , 021 ) were rejected . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Inter - Referee Reliability of the Peer Review Process Agreement among referees’ recommendations Table 1 shows kappa coefficients describing agreement between the responses of two or more referees per Communication to the question , “Do you recommend acceptance of the Communication ? ” ( response categories : “Yes , without alterations , ” “Yes , after minor alterations , ” “Yes , but only after major alterations , ” and “No” ) . Kappa ( κ ) is a statistical measure of level of agreement between two or more raters . [ 23 ] If the raters are in complete agreement then κ = 1 ; if κ is near 0 , the observed level of agreement is not much higher than a chance level : “Multiplied by 100 , κ indicates the percentage by which two raters’ agreement exceeds the agreement that could be expected from chance . ” [ 23 , p . 5 ] As Table 1 shows , for peer 5 review at Angewandte Chemie the kappa coefficients range from 0 . 10 to 0 . 21 , depending on the κ statistic ( weighted or unweighted ) and the number of referees ( between two and five ) that made a recommendation on a Communication . In other words , the referees show agreement in their responses on 10 - 21 % more manuscripts than would have been expected by chance . Although different κ statistics were calculated and the responses of a differing number of referees per Communication were included in the analysis , the resulting values hardly differed . [ 24 ] According to guidelines for the interpretation of κ , [ 23 ] the coefficients in Table 1 indicate a low level of agreement among referees’ recommendations . This result confirms Daniel’s [ 25 ] findings on peer review at Angewandte Chemie in the mid 1980s . The other studies that are available on inter - referee reliability of recommendations at other journals also report low kappa coefficients . [ 8 ] Agreement between referees’ recommendations and editorial decisions In the manuscript peer review process the journal editor makes the decision to accept or reject a Communication for publication based on the referees’ recommendations . [ 26 ] If the recommendations of the referees on one and the same Communication agree , the editor can make the decision based on both referees . But what is the editor’s decision , when the referees’ recommendations on a manuscript differ ( such as , “Yes , after minor alterations” and “No” ) ? To answer this question , for each Communication we produced a configuration of the referees’ responses to the question , “Do you recommend acceptance of the Communication ? ” ( for example , Referee 1 : “Yes , without alterations” and Referee 2 : “Yes , after minor alterations” ) and examined the correlation between this response configuration and the editor’s decision . As the results in Table 2 show , response configurations in which the referees recommend accepting a Communication for publication ( without alterations , with minor or major alterations ) are associated with the editorial decision to accept for publication ; for the rejected Communications it is the other way around . Therefore , with regard to the referees’ 6 response configurations , the test statistic indicates a highly significant difference between the decisions to accept and reject ( see Table 2 ) . There is thus statistical evidence that a Communication is as a rule accepted by the journal editor , when both referees ( Referee 1 and Referee 2 ) have previously recommended accepting it for publication . 3 . 2 . Predictive Validity of the Peer Review Process The Supporting Information for the present Essay provides extensive information on what journals Communications rejected for publication by Angewandte Chemie were later published in and on how greatly the authors altered the Communications for publication in other journals . Here , in the following , we examine the predictive validity of the peer review process at Angewandte Chemie , based on the mean citation counts of manuscripts accepted for publication and manuscripts rejected by the journal but then published elsewhere and on the Journal Impact Factors ( JIFs ) of the journals in which the rejected Communications were later published . JIFs are published by Thomson Reuters ( Philadelphia , PA , USA ) in the Journal Citation Reports ( JCR ) and are a measure of the “average” response of the scientific community to an article in a journal . [ 27 ] Published annually by Thomson Reuters , the JIF is the quotient of citations and number of citable items : the JIF is determined based on the articles published in a journal in a two - year period and their citations indexed in the year thereafter . The number of times that the articles were cited is then divided by the number of citable items ( for Angewandte Chemie , these are essentially the Communications and a small number of reviews ) published in the previous two years . [ 28 ] According to the results of investigation in two literature databases , of the total of 1 , 021 Communications rejected for publication by Angewandte Chemie , 959 were published as contributions ( 93 . 9 % ) in other journals , seven as patents , and two as contributions to anthologies . No publication information was found for 53 ( 5 . 2 % ) of the rejected Communications . The 959 Communications that later appeared in other journals were 7 published in 136 journals . Fifty or more rejected Communications each were published in the journals Chemical Communications ( n = 119 ) , Organic Letters ( n = 91 ) , Journal of the American Chemical Society ( n = 70 ) , Tetrahedron Letters ( n = 60 ) , and Organometallics ( n = 50 ) . No alterations or only minor alterations were made to approximately three - quarters of the rejected Communications for publication elsewhere . The Communications rejected for publication by Angewandte Chemie were published in other journals within a time period of seven years ( that is , between 2000 and 2006 ) . According to the Journal Citation Reports for the year 2006 , the JIFs of these other journals ranged from less than 1 ( for example , CHIMIA and Chinese Chemical Letters ) to 9 . 96 ( Nano Letters ) . As measured by these JIFs , the Angewandte Chemie editorial decisions to accept or reject are highly valid . None of the total of 956 rejected Communications was published in a journal having a higher JIF than Angewandte Chemie ( JIF 2006 = 10 . 23 ) ; 1 all of the rejected Communications were published in a journal having a lower JIF ( with the exception of 16 rejected Communications that were accepted for publication by Angewandte Chemie after re - submission ) . This same result was found by Daniel [ 14 ] for Communications rejected by Angewandte Chemie in the year 1984 . These findings confirm Cronin and McKenzie’s general observation that manuscripts that are rejected by prestigious journals having high JIFs are usually later submitted to ( and published by ) journals having lower JIFs : “It is widely recognised that there is an informal journal pecking order in almost every discipline , and that a manuscript rejected by a high - ranking journal will often be re - submitted 1 Based on JIFs published by Thomson Reuters in the Journal Citation Reports for the years 2000 and 2001 ( that is , for the years in which most of the rejected manuscripts were published elsewhere ) , only one rejected manuscript was published in a journal having a higher JIF , namely , in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America ( PNAS ) ( JIF 2000 = 10 . 79 ; JIF 2001 = 10 . 90 ) . The JIF of Angewandte Chemie was 8 . 55 for 2000 and 8 . 26 for 2001 . In the Journal Citation Reports for 2006 , Angewandte Chemie ( JIF 2006 = 10 . 23 ) had a higher JIF than PNAS ( JIF 2006 = 9 . 64 ) . 8 to one of lesser repute . ” [ 29 , p . 310 ] However , the JIF is only a very rough measure for determining predictive validity , because all of the contributions in a journal are characterized by an average value . [ 30 ] It thus underestimates the citations of the top cited articles while exaggerating the number of citations of articles that are not or infrequently cited . [ 14 ] For this reason , going beyond JIFs , we determined how frequently the manuscripts accepted for publication and the manuscripts rejected but later published elsewhere were cited after being published up to the year 2006 . The citation counts for the individual manuscripts were investigated in Scopus , a research literature database . [ 31 ] Scopus , which is a new multidisciplinary database provided by Elsevier ( Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) , contains over 33 million abstracts and references from 15 , 000 peer - reviewed journals from more than 4 , 000 international publishers and is currently the largest multidisciplinary database of research . [ 32 ] Based on results by Norris and Oppenheim [ 33 ] Scopus can be considered an equally matched alternative to the Science Citation Index ( SCI ) from Thomson Reuters . As the results for publication years 2000 and 2001 in Figure 1 show , the Communications accepted for publication were clearly more frequently cited than the rejected Communications ( an analysis of the citations in SCI and Chemical Abstracts ( Chemical Abstracts Services , Columbus , OH , USA ) yielded similar results ) . [ 34 ] For publication years 2002 to 2006 the comparison could not be conducted , as after 2001 only manuscripts that had been rejected but were later published elsewhere were published , but no manuscripts accepted for publication ( reviewed in the year 2000 ) were published in Angewandte Chemie ( the period of time to publication at Angewandte Chemie is comparatively short ) . The differences in the means between the citation counts are statistically significant ( see Figure 1 ) . This result corresponds with the finding that the rejected manuscripts were later published in journals having a lower JIF ( see above ) . Since – as the citation analysis results make clear – the citation counts of manuscripts accepted and rejected for publication differ statistically 9 significantly , the findings of the citation analysis confirm the predictive validity of the peer review process at Angewandte Chemie . 4 . Discussion Against the background of criticisms of the peer review process , the present study investigated peer review at Angewandte Chemie according to the criteria of inter - referee agreement and predictive validity . With regard to the reliability of the peer review process , the kappa coefficients ( between 0 . 10 and 0 . 21 ) indicated a low level of agreement between the referees’ recommendations concerning acceptance or rejection of a Communication . Similar findings on peer review at Angewandte Chemie were reported by Daniel in an earlier study . [ 25 ] Although a high level of agreement among assessments is generally seen as desirable , when it comes to peer review some researchers , such as Bailar , view agreement as detrimental to the review process : “Too much agreement is in fact a sign that the review process is not working well , that reviewers are not properly selected for diversity , and that some are redundant . ” [ 35 , p . 138 ] Although selecting referees according to the principle of complementarity ( for example , choosing a generalist and a specialist ) will lower inter - referee agreement , the validity of the process can gain , according to Langfeldt : “Low inter - reviewer agreement on a peer panel is no indication of low validity or low legitimacy of the assessments . In fact , it may indicate that the panel is highly competent because it represents a wide sample of the various views on what is good and valuable research . ” [ 36 , p . 821 ] Differing recommendations in manuscript refereeing are not necessarily a sign of disagreement and can be due to the differing paradigmatic positions ( “schools” ) , approaches , and mentalities of the referees . [ 37 ] In addition , referees can tend to be more critical or more lenient in their judgments ; [ 38 ] they direct their attention , writes Eckberg , to “different points , and may draw different conclusions about ‘worth’” . [ 39 , p . 146 ] 10 The examination of the fate of Communications that were rejected for publication by Angewandte Chemie showed that , with a very few exceptions , all of the Communications were subsequently published elsewhere . They were always published in journals having a lower JIF than Angewandte Chemie . The citation analysis showed that the Communications accepted by Angewandte Chemie were on average cited statistically more frequently than manuscripts rejected by the journal and published elsewhere . Both of these findings attest to the predictive validity of the peer review process at Angewandte Chemie . Similar findings have been reported to date not only by Daniel [ 14 ] for Angewandte Chemie but also by Lock , [ 40 ] Wilson , [ 41 ] and Opthof , Furstner , van Geer , and Coronel [ 42 ] for the British Medical Journal , the Journal of Clinical Investigation , and Cardiovascular Research . Although the surrounding conditions of the peer review process at Angewandte Chemie have definitely changed since the mid 1980s ( that is , since the study by Daniel ) [ 14 ] ( for example , dramatic increase in the number of Communications submitted and clear decrease in the acceptance rate ) , the results of the present investigation of inter - referee agreement and predictive validity demonstrate once again the high quality of the peer review process at Angewandte Chemie . 11 [ 1 ] J .

Of a total of 1 , 899 Communications , 1 , 507 could be included in the statistical analysis of agreement between Angewandte Chemie referees : Of a total of 4 , 593 external recommendations , 3 , 023 are available with an evaluation form containing the question , “Do you recommend acceptance of the Communication ? , ” to which the referees responded “Yes , without alterations , ” “Yes , after minor alterations , ” “Yes , but only after major alterations , ” or “No . ” These 3 , 023 recommendations pertain to 1 , 840 Communications . Since testing for inter - referee agreement requires at least two recommendations per Communication , 952 Communications with two recommendations , 535 Communications with three recommendations , 19 Communications with four recommendations , and one Communication with five recommendations could be included in the analysis ( for 333 Communications , only one recommendation is available ) . In addition to the kappa coefficient for Communications with two to five recommendations ( n = 1 , 507 ) , coefficients were calculated for Communications with two ( n = 952 ) and three ( n = 535 ) recommendations . For Communications for which four or five recommendations are available , these coefficients were not calculated , as for 19 Communications ( four recommendations ) and one Communication ( five recommendations ) the number of cases is too small . The table shows weighted ( g ) and unweighted ( u ) κ . In contrast to unweighted κ , weighted κ additionally takes into account that where there is a lack of agreement between the responses of two referees , there can be different degrees of disagreement . In the analysis , a weight of 0 . 6667 was assigned to those Communications where the referees show “two - thirds’ agreement” ( that is , the referees’ chose nearby response categories , such as “Yes , without alterations” and “Yes , after minor alterations” ) . A weight of 0 . 3333 was assigned in the case of one - third agreement ( for example , “Yes , without alterations” and “Yes , after major alterations” ) . In the analysis , a weight of 0 ( that is , no weight ) was used when the referees’ responses were completely contrary and a weight of 1 was used when the referees’ responses agreed completely . * Based on 1 , 000 sample tables . * * p < 0 . 05 . * * * Significance tests can not be calculated . 15 Table 2 .

Of a total of 1 , 899 Communications , 718 could be included in the analysis . To test in the statistical analysis whether the editor’s decision is based on the recommendations of the referees , it is necessary that for all of the recommendations pertaining to a Communication , the referees responded to the question , “Do you recommend acceptance of the Communication ? ” Of the 1 , 069 Communications for which this condition is fulfilled , there are two recommendations for 718 Communications , three recommendations for 241 Communications , and four recommendations for seven Communications , ( only one recommendation each is available for 103 Communications ) . Since a statistical analysis that includes a response configuration with three ( n = 241 ) and four ( n = 7 ) recommendations per Communication is not advisable due to the small number of cases and the large number of possible configurations , the analysis was carried out using 718 Communications , for each of which there were two recommendations . For this subgroup , agreement between the referees’ recommendations , with kappa coefficients of 0 . 27 ( unweighted κ ) and 0 . 43 ( weighted κ ) , is stronger than in the whole group ( see Table 1 ) . With regard to the response configurations , the difference between decisions to accept or reject is statistically significant ; χ 2 test : χ 2 ( 9 , n = 718 ) = 606 . 2 , p < 0 . 0001 . Cells with standardized residuals greater than 2 ( or less than - 2 ) are shown in the table in bold type . Residuals are a measure of how strongly the observed frequencies deviate from the expected frequencies . Figure 1 .

Of a total of 1 , 899 Communications , 1 , 827 could be included in the analysis : 62 of the Communications rejected by Angewandte Chemie were – according to the results of our search – not published elsewhere .
