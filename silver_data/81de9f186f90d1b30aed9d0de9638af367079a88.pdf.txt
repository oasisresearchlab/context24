Duxbury , D . J . Jacobs , M . F . Thorpe Department of Physics and Astronomy and Center for Fundamental Materials Research Michigan State University , East Lansing , Michigan 48824 - 1116 and C . Moukarzel Instituto de F´isica Univesidade Federal Fluminense 24210 - 340 Niter´oi , Rio de Janeiro , Brasil We show that negative of the number of ﬂoppy modes behaves as a free energy for both con - nectivity and rigidity percolation , and we illustrate this result using Bethe lattices . The rigidity transition on Bethe lattices is found to be ﬁrst order at a bond concentration close to that predicted by Maxwell constraint counting . We calculate the probability of a bond being on the inﬁnite cluster and also on the overconstrained part of the inﬁnite cluster , and show how a speciﬁc heat can be deﬁned as the second derivative of the free energy . We demonstrate that the Bethe lattice solution is equivalent to that of the random bond model , where points are joined randomly ( with equal prob - ability at all length scales ) to have a given coordination , and then subsequently bonds are randomly removed . 1 I . INTRODUCTION Connectivity percolation on Bethe lattices or inﬁnite statistically homogeneous Cayley trees was thoroughly analyzed by Fisher and Essam , [ 1 ] and provides a useful model for percolation . Rigidity on Cayley trees was ﬁrst studied by Moukarzel , Duxbury and Leath ; [ 2 ] henceforth referred to as MDL . This model has g degrees of freedom per site , with g = 1 corresponding to connectivity per - colation being a special case , and so may be regarded as an extension of the work of Fisher and Essam . [ 1 ] In this paper , we develop a free energy for the rigidity percola - tion problem , and as an example of its use , show how to locate the bulk rigidity transition on the Bethe lattice . We use the term Bethe lattice , rather than Cayley tree , to emphasize the bulk behavior of lattices containing no loops away from the boundary . [ 1 , 3 ] FIG . 1 . Showing a tree with a single bar b = 1 along the z = 3 bonds from each site . The bonds are present with probability p . Each site , shown as a shaded circle , has g degrees of freedom . Only the ﬁrst few levels from the rigid busbar are shown . We have previously suggested that a free energy can be deﬁned as the negative of the number of ﬂoppy modes . [ 4 ] In this paper we prove this assertion for the case of random bond dilution in a general lattice with g degrees of freedom per site , and with z nearest neighbors , con - nected by b = 1 bars . For g = 1 , this gives connectivity percolation . For g = d , this corresponds to the central force model [ 5 , 6 ] , where g = 2 in two dimensions and g = 6 in three dimensions . For bodies joined by bars , g = d ( d + 1 ) / 2 in a d dimensional space . [ 2 ] We prove that this free energy has the correct convex - ity property and hence a speciﬁc heat can be deﬁned from the second derivative . This deﬁnition of the free energy reduces to the known result for connectivity percolation when g = 1 , where it becomes the negative of the total number of isolated clusters . [ 7 ] This latter result can ei - ther be found directly , [ 7 ] or as the s → 1 limit of the s state Potts model . [ 8 ] For rigidity , this free energy allows us to locate the bulk transition on the Cayley tree , and we refer to this as the Bethe lattice solution . [ 3 ] We conﬁrm that for b = 1 and g ≥ 2 the rigidity transition is always ﬁrst order on the Bethe lattice , whereas of course it is second order for connectivity percolation where g = 1 . On the triangular lattice , rigidity percolation is second order . [ 9 – 11 ] , whereas it is ﬁrst order on the Bethe lattice . The nature of the rigidity transition is a subtle question , depending on the network , and this has not always been taken into account . [ 12 ] For connectivity percolation , the transition is always second order . [ 1 , 13 ] MDL developed a general solution , using a transfer ma - trix technique , for a network of rigid bodies , each with g degrees of freedom generically connected by b bars , as sketched in Fig . 1 . Initially each rigid body has z neigh - bors , and the rigidity of the network is studied as the bonds are randomly removed . For b ≤ g , this type of network is always ﬂoppy , unless the tree is attached to a rigid surface ( busbar ) , in which case rigidity may or may not propagate away from the busbar , depending on the degree of dilution . We amplify the work of MDL by using the free energy and the associated Maxwell construction , [ 14 ] to remove boundary constraints in the analysis of bond diluted Cay - ley trees , and hence obtain the bulk or Bethe lattice so - lution . This constraint equation leads to a higher rigidity threshold than that found in MDL . In analogy with ther - mally driven thermodynamic transitions , we interpret the threshold found in MDL as a spinodal point and use p s when referring to it in this paper . We use p c to refer to the bulk threshold . The layout of this paper is as follows . In the next section ( Sec . II ) we develop results applicable to general bond - diluted lattices , namely : the proof that the nega - tive of the number of ﬂoppy modes acts as a free energy for studying bond - diluted connectivity and rigidity per - colation , and we derive the associated Maxwell construc - tion [ 14 ] or consistency condition . We review the main equations from MDL for the Cayley tree , and evaluate the probability P ∞ of being in the inﬁnite rigid cluster and also the probability P ov of being in the overconstrained part of the inﬁnite cluster ; both deﬁned in the bulk far from the busbar . In Sec . III , we discuss the random bond model , [ 15 ] where z bonds join each site with other sites , regardless of distance , and then these bonds are randomly diluted . This model is solved using the integer algorithm , the peb - ble game , [ 9 , 10 , 16 ] for the connectivity case g = 1 , z = 3 and the rigidity case g = 2 , z = 6 . We demonstrate that in the thermodynamic limit , the random bond model is equivalent to a Bethe lattice . In Sec . IV , we show that for g = 1 , the familiar con - nectivity case is recovered . This analysis is examined for a general z , specializing to z = 3 to illustrate the detailed 2 behavior for connectivity percolation . In Sec . V , we give detailed results for a Bethe lattice with g = 2 and z = 6 as an example of a ﬁrst - order rigidity transition . We apply the consistency condition to locate the ﬁrst order transition in the bulk , and show that the results are equivalent to the random bond model . We also give results for the probability P ∞ of being on the inﬁnite cluster and the probability P ov of being on its overconstrained part . We show that the results for the number of ﬂoppy are equivalent to the g = 2 random bond model . We present a table summarizing important results for a range of values of g and z . In Sec . VI , we show how the limit z → ∞ can be taken . We show when a further limit g → ∞ is also taken , we recover the Maxwell constraint counting result , which we therefore identiﬁed as the mean ﬁeld theory for rigidity . Throughout this paper we focus our attention on bond dilution where the number of bars b = 1 . Results for b ≥ 2 and / or for site dilution can probably be obtained in a similar manner . II . FORMALISM A . General In this subsection we develop a free energy for both connectivity and rigidity problems on general lattices , and show that this leads to a consistency constraint on the number of ﬂoppy modes that is useful in locating ﬁrst order transitions . These results are applied to Cayley trees in the next sections . A constraint counting method ( also called Maxwell counting ) has been very useful as a conceptual tool in understanding rigidity , and in particular the rigidity of glasses . [ 4 , 17 – 19 ] The Maxwell counting approach centers on the number of ﬂoppy modes , where we deﬁne f ( p ) as the average number of ﬂoppy modes per degree of free - dom . We consider generic networks where each site has g degrees of freedom with central forces that connect to z neighbors . Bonds are randomly present with probability p . An exact relation on any bond - diluted lattice is f ( p ) = F gN = 1 − z 2 g [ p − r ( p ) ] , ( 1 ) where F is the total number of ﬂoppy modes . There are N sites in the network , and r ( p ) is the probabil - ity that a bond is redundant , i . e . its removal does not change the number of ﬂoppy modes in the system . Eq . ( 1 ) demonstrates that we can count either ﬂoppy modes or redundant bonds , and although early work has empha - sized counting ﬂoppy modes , [ 4 , 18 ] they are equivalent . In Maxwell counting , r ( p ) is assumed to be zero for p < p m and the rigidity threshold is taken to occur at f ( p m ) = 0 , which leads to the Maxwell estimate of the rigidity threshold , p m = 2 g / z . ( 2 ) Within this approximation it is evident that f ( p ) = 0 for p ≥ p m f ( p ) = 1 − p / p m for p ≤ p m , ( 3 ) so that f ( p ) changes slope at p m . We emphasize that Maxwell counting is not correct , but does provide a useful initial approximation . In reality f 6 = 0 for p ≥ p m and is non - zero right up to p = 1 as there is always a small probability of having a ﬂoppy inclusion if p 6 = 1 . This is a Lifshitz type of argument . [ 20 ] We note that f ( 0 ) = 1 and f ( 1 ) = 0 , and hence from Eq . ( 1 ) we have r ( 0 ) = 0 and r ( 1 ) = 1 − 2 g z . ( 4 ) Equivalently , the following relation must be satisﬁed Z 1 0 f ( 1 ) dp = − 1 . ( 5 ) These consistency conditions remove boundary con - straints from the calculation and hence enable prediction of bulk critical behavior . This is a key new element of the Cayley tree theory , which was lacking in MDL , and which we now refer to as the bulk or Bethe lattice solution . In particular it allows us to locate the bulk critical point p c when the transition is ﬁrst order . In MDL , the point at which the ﬁnite real solution to the mean ﬁeld equa - tions ceased to exist was identiﬁed as the critical point . Here we label that point as p s and reinterpret it as the spinodal point in analog with thermally driven ﬁrst - order transitions . We now show that the number of ﬂoppy modes acts as a free energy in both connectivity and rigidity problems . To demonstrate this , we recall the relation developed by Jacobs and Thorpe [ 10 ] f ( 1 ) ( p ) = − z 2 g (cid:18) 1 − N 0 N B (cid:19) = − z 2 g N I N B ( 6 ) where f is the number of ﬂoppy modes per degree of freedom , N 0 is the number of overconstrained bonds on the lattice , N I is the number of isostatic bonds on the lattice , and N B = pzN 2 = N 0 + N I ( 7 ) is the total number of bonds present on the lattice , and the ﬁrst derivative f ( 1 ) = ∂f / ∂p . The relation ( 6 ) is obtained by removing a single bond , chosen at random , and ascertaining the probability that this bond is in an overconstrained region ( in which case the number of ﬂoppy modes is unchanged ) or else the number of ﬂoppy modes is reduced by 1 . That is ( for one removed bond ) 3 ∆ F = ( 1 − N 0 / N B ) , and if we now remove ∆ N B bonds , we have ∂F ∂N B = − (cid:18) 1 − N 0 N B (cid:19) , ( 8 ) and the result ( 6 ) follows . By comparing Eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 6 ) , we see that the number of overconstrained bonds is given by the rate of change of the number of redundant bonds . ∂r ( p ) ∂p = N 0 N B . ( 9 ) We can use a similar argument to derive the important result f ( 2 ) ( p ) = z 2 g r ( 2 ) ( p ) ≥ 0 ( 10 ) where the second derivative f ( 2 ) = ∂ 2 f / ∂ 2 p . We demon - strate this as follows . If we remove one bond , chosen at random , then the change in the number of overcon - strained bonds is given by ∆ N 0 = − N 0 N B ( 1 + λ ) ( 11 ) where λ ≥ 0 because when an overconstrained bond is removed , the number of overconstrained bonds is reduced by at least one , and sometimes by more . If we remove ∆ N B bonds , we therefore have ∂N 0 ∂N B = N 0 N B ( 1 + λ ) ( 12 ) Using this , we ﬁnd ∂ ∂N B N 0 N B = 1 N B (cid:18) ∂N 0 ∂N B − N 0 N B (cid:19) = λ N B N 0 N B ( 13 ) and hence using ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , f ( 2 ) ( p ) = λz 2 pg N 0 N B ≥ 0 ( 14 ) establishing that − f ( p ) is a convex function of the frac - tion of bonds present p . Note that we must ensemble average the results ( 12 ) and ( 14 ) so that λ is to be inter - preted as an ensemble averaged quantity . Therefore we can use − f ( p ) as a free energy , and if there is any ambiguity the system will always be in the lowest free energy ( maximum ﬂoppy modes ) state . The quantity − f ( p ) is convex as required of a free energy , and we will refer to f ( p ) interchangeably as the fraction of ﬂoppy modes or as the free energy . Note that the proof above is given for arbitrary g and z , but restricted to b = 1 and bond dilution . Because f ( 2 ) ( p ) is the second derivative of a free energy and is positive deﬁnite , we can regard it as a speciﬁc heat and it is calculated explicitly in subsequent sections . [ 21 ] B . Cayley Trees Following MDL , we consider trees which have co - ordination number z with g degrees of freedom per site , which form a Cayley tree network attached to a rigid boundary which we call a busbar . This is shown in Fig . 1 . The busbar is not necessary for connectivity when g = 1 , but is of vital importance for rigidity when g ≥ 2 . We deﬁne T n 0 to be the probability that a bond on a branch n levels away from the busbar is part of the inﬁnite rigid cluster . In general , if the sites of the tree have g degrees of freedom , rigidity is transmitted to the next level of the tree provided at least g of the bonds to the lower level are occupied and provided that the sites at the ends of these bonds are rigid . This gives the recurrence relation T n + 1 0 = z − 1 X k = g (cid:18) z − 1 k (cid:19) ( pT n 0 ) k ( 1 − pT n 0 ) z − 1 − k , ( 15 ) where T n 0 is the probability a bond n levels from the busbar is rigid . If we take the thermodynamic limit ( very large n ) , Eq . ( 15 ) iterates to a steady - state solution , which we call T 0 and is given by T 0 = z − 1 X k = g (cid:18) z − 1 k (cid:19) ( pT 0 ) k ( 1 − pT 0 ) z − 1 − k . ( 16 ) From this equation , we can ﬁnd the probability of having a single degree of freedom with respect to the ( distant ) boundary T 1 = (cid:18) z − 1 g − 1 (cid:19) ( pT 0 ) g − 1 ( 1 − pT 0 ) z − g , g 6 = 1 . ( 17 ) and more generally for l degrees of freedom with respect to the boundary T l = (cid:18) z − 1 g − l (cid:19) ( pT 0 ) g − l ( 1 − pT 0 ) z − g + l − 1 , 1 ≤ l ≤ g . ( 18 ) Summing over all possibilities , we have the useful sum rule g X l = 0 T l = 1 . ( 19 ) Equation ( 16 ) is the self - consistent equation for the rigid - ity order parameter on bond - diluted Cayley trees . MDL also considered a more general class of problem in which another degree of freedom b ≥ 2 [ the number of con - straints ( or bars ) between each pair of sites ] is allowed . They also considered the case of site dilution , which is trivially related to bond dilution on a Cayley tree for b = 1 only . For trees with b = 1 , the probability that a bond is overconstrained is pT 20 , i . e . a bond is overconstrained if 4 it is present and both of the sites at its ends are already rigidly connected to the busbar . Such bonds are the overconstrained bonds of the inﬁnite cluster , as no other bonds are overconstrained far from the busbar , which is the bulk solution that we are seeking . Thus from ( 6 ) we have , f ( 1 ) ( p ) = − z 2 g (cid:18) 1 − pT 20 p (cid:19) = − z 2 g ( 1 − T 20 ) . ( 20 ) Diﬀerentiating a second time gives f ( 2 ) ( p ) = z g T 0 ∂T 0 ∂p . ( 21 ) Since T 0 ≥ 0 , we must have solutions where ∂T 0 ∂p ≥ 0 ( 22 ) to be acceptable . In a similar way the probability that a bond is con - nected to the inﬁnite rigid cluster via the busbar at one end , but has one degree of freedom at the other is 2 pT 0 T 1 . Such bonds are the isostatic bonds associated with the inﬁnite cluster . [ 9 – 11 ] Thus the total probability that a bond , that is present , belongs to the inﬁnite cluster P ∞ is P ∞ = T 02 + 2 T 0 T 1 . ( 23 ) The probability that a bond that is present and belongs to the overconstrained part of the backbone is given by P ov = T 02 . ( 24 ) Since the number of redundant bonds r ( p ) is zero for p ≤ p c and after ﬁnding r ( 1 ) ( p ) = T 20 from ( 20 ) using ( 1 ) , we must have , r ( p ) = Z p p c T 20 dp . ( 25 ) In particular , combining Eq . ( 25 ) , with the consistency condition ( 4 ) , we have r ( 1 ) = Z 1 p c T 20 dp = 1 − 2 g z ( 26 ) This is the key new component of the theory developed here . As in MDL , we solve the tree equations for the order parameter T 0 but now we use Eq . ( 26 ) to identify the rigidity threshold p c . Once we have p c , the number of ﬂoppy modes at any p is given by [ from Eq . ( 1 ) using ( 25 ) ] , f ( p ) = 1 − z 2 g (cid:20) p − Z p p c T 2 0 dp (cid:21) . ( 27 ) The condition , Eq . ( 26 ) may be regarded as a Maxwell condition , in analogy with that commonly used to locate the ﬁrst order transition in thermodynamic systems . [ 14 ] III . RANDOM BOND MODEL The random bond model consists of N sites thrown down randomly , with each site joined at random to z other sites ( without regard to distance ) to form a z - coordinated network . Small rings appear with proba - bility O ( 1 / N ) . It is convenient to show this network in a plane as in Fig . 2 , where z = 3 . The dimension of this model is only deﬁned through the number of degrees of freedom g associated with each site . In the Bethe lattice and in the random bond model , there are no loops in the thermodynamic limit N → ∞ and so in a diagrammatic expansion , all terms agree , and the models are equiva - lent . For ﬁnite Cayley trees , there are loops involving the busbar as can be seen in Fig . 1 . Likewise , there are loops in the random bond model as can be seen in Fig . 2 . So the equivalence is only in the bulk thermodynamic limit . We ﬁnd this is a useful alternative viewpoint on the Bethe lattice limit . We have numerically examined connectivity percola - tion having g = 1 , z = 3 , and the g = 2 , z = 6 rigidity percolation case using the random bond model . These simulation results are compared with the corresponding exact Bethe lattice calculations in the next two sections . The pebble game [ 9 , 10 , 16 ] was used to ﬁnd the number of ﬂoppy modes and the derivatives f ( 1 ) ( p ) and f ( 2 ) ( p ) for the g = 2 , z = 6 case . For connectivity percolation with g = 1 , a similar pebble game algorithm can be con - structed where only one pebble is assigned to a site . [ 22 ] In fact , as long as a site represents a rigid body having g degrees of freedom and not a point , the pebble game can be straight forwardly generalized by assigning g pebbles to each site . [ 23 ] For the connectivity percolation case , however , we ac - tually used the g = 2 pebble game , ( two pebbles per site ) , by invoking an interesting mapping that makes g = 2 rigidity percolation equivalent to connectivity percola - tion . This mapping is valid for any generic network and is not limited to the random bond model . The mapping consists of adding a single ghost site to the N site net - work . The ghost site has g = 2 as do all other sites in the network . An additional N bonds are placed between each of the N sites in the network and the ghost site . With this additional ghost site and its associated bonds , the network consists of edge sharing triangles . That is , any three sites in the network that are connected , are mutually rigid because they form edge sharing triangles with the ghost site common to all triangles . The ghost site and its associated bonds , allow connec - tivity to be a suﬃcient condition for a set of sites to be mutually rigid . Since rigid clusters are those that are connected , a one to one mapping between clusters in a g = 2 network to a g = 1 network is established . How - ever , the number of ﬂoppy modes of the g = 2 network ( with the ghost site ) will be two more than the num - ber of rigid clusters . These ﬂoppy modes can be viewed as two translational motions for the ghost site , and one 5 rotational motion of each rigid cluster about the ghost site . By accounting for these two extra modes , an exact mapping is established . FIG . 2 . A sketch of the random bond model with a single bar b = 1 along the z = 3 bonds from each site . The bonds are present with probability p . Each site , shown as a shaded circle , has g degrees of freedom . Only N = 12 sites are shown in this sketch . In simulations using the pebble game , we use N = 262 , 144 . IV . CONNECTIVITY PERCOLATION The analysis in Sec . II holds for any value of g . For g = 1 we recover and extend the familiar results of con - nectivity percolation [ 1 , 13 ] for random bond dilution on a tree with coordination z . In this section we use a general z as much as possible , but then focus on z = 3 to simplify the algebra when necessary . For g = 1 , Eqn . ( 16 ) reduces to T 0 = (cid:2) 1 − ( 1 − pT 0 ) z − 1 (cid:3) . ( 28 ) Expanding near p c it is easy to show that the order pa - rameter T 0 vanishes as T 0 ∼ 2 ( p − p c ) p c ( 1 − p c ) with p c = 1 z − 1 . ( 29 ) The number of redundant bonds r ( p ) can be found from ( 25 ) by using ( 28 ) to ﬁrst calculate ∂T 0 / ∂p and then doing the integration to give r ( p ) = T 0 (cid:20)(cid:18) z − 2 z (cid:19) ( 1 + p − pT 0 ) − ( 1 − p ) (cid:21) ( 30 ) where T 0 is obtained by solving the polynomial ( 28 ) . No - tice that the fraction of bonds in overconstrained regions on the inﬁnite cluster is given from Eqs . ( 23 ) and ( 24 ) and using T 1 = 1 − T 0 P ov P ∞ = T 20 T 02 + 2 T 0 T 1 = T 0 2 − T 0 . ( 31 ) When p = 1 , we have T 0 = 1 , so that the ratio ( 31 ) becomes unity , meaning that the entire tree is overcon - strained ( no dangling ends ) . Near p = p c , and using ( 29 ) , the fraction of overconstrained bonds in the inﬁnite cluster goes to zero linearly as P ov P ∞ ∼ p − p c p c ( 1 − p c ) , ( 32 ) so that as the connectivity percolation transition is ap - proached , the inﬁnite cluster becomes completely iso - static . For z = 3 we can solve the quadratic equation ( 28 ) to get T 0 = 0 for p ≤ p c T 0 = ( 2 p − 1 ) p 2 for p ≥ p c ( 33 ) where p c = 1 / 2 , and is shown in Fig . 3 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 p 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 T O FIG . 3 . The result for bond diluted connectivity percola - tion on a Bethe lattice for T 0 is shown for co - ordination num - ber z = 3 and with g = 1 degrees of freedom per site . The probability that a bond is present is p , and percolation occurs at p c = 0 . 5 . We can use ( 30 ) to check that we get the same value of p c , by noting that we correctly reproduce r ( 1 ) = 1 / 3 [ see Eq . ( 4 ) ] . Therefore the transition is indeed second order . Having found p c , we ﬁnd f ( p ) and r ( p ) from Eqs . ( 25 ) and ( 27 ) . 6 f ( p ) = 1 − 3 p 2 for p ≤ p c f ( p ) = (cid:18) 1 − p p (cid:19) 3 ( 3 p − 1 ) 2 for p ≥ p c ( 34 ) and r ( p ) = 0 for p ≤ p c r ( p ) = 1 3 (cid:18) 2 p − 1 p (cid:19) 3 for p ≥ p c ( 35 ) and by diﬀerentiating ( 34 ) f ( 1 ) ( p ) = − 3 2 for p ≤ p c f ( 1 ) ( p ) = − 3 2 ( 1 − p ) 2 ( p 2 + 2 p − 1 ) p 4 for p ≥ p c ( 36 ) and diﬀerentiating again f ( 2 ) ( p ) = 0 for p ≤ p c f ( 2 ) ( p ) = 6 ( 2 p − 1 ) ( 1 − p ) p 5 for p ≥ p c .

Results for bond diluted connectivity percolation on a Bethe lattice for the number of ﬂoppy modes f ( p ) and the ﬁrst two derivatives . The number of redundant bonds r ( p ) are also shown . The second derivative f ( 2 ) ( p ) acts as a speciﬁc heat for this problem . Results are for co - ordination number z = 3 and with g = 1 degrees of freedom per site . The probability that a bond is present is p , and percolation occurs at p c = 0 . 5 . The open circles are from computer simulations of the random bond model using the pebble game as described in Sec . III , using N = 262 , 144 sites and averaging over 2 , 000 realizations . The Maxwell estimate [ Eqs . ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ] for the number of ﬂoppy modes is a straight line follows the f ( p ) at small p . These results ( 34 ) - ( 37 ) are shown in Fig . 4 . We note that this second derivative , which is like a speciﬁc heat , is strongly peaked around p = 1 − 1 / √ 6 = 0 . 59 , although it does go zero at p c = 0 . 50 . Note also that f , f ( 1 ) and f ( 2 ) are all continuous at p c , with f ( 3 ) being the ﬁrst derivative to show a discontinuity . [ 4 ] The number of overconstrained bonds in the inﬁnite cluster is P ov and is given from ( 24 ) by P ov = (cid:18) 2 p − 1 p 2 (cid:19) 2 for p ≥ p c ( 38 ) and the fraction of bonds in the inﬁnite cluster P ∞ is given by ( 23 ) P ∞ = 1 − (cid:18) 1 − p p (cid:19) 4 for p ≥ p c ( 39 ) which has been derived by Essam and Fisher , [ 1 ] [ see their Eq . ( 35b ) ] although notice they have an extra factor of p as they normalized to all bonds , not just those present . These results are shown in Fig . 5 . The reader might be concerned that some overconstrained bonds are not asso - ciated with the inﬁnite cluster . This is not so on a Cayley tree in the asymptotic limit where only the inﬁnite cluster reaches back to the busbar . All other clusters are isolated and contain no overconstrained bonds , except ﬁnite rigid clusters attached to the busbar which are considered to be surface eﬀects and hence are ignored in the bulk or Bethe lattice solution . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 p 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 P r obab ili t y 8 P P ov FIG . 5 . Results for bond diluted connectivity percolation on a Bethe lattice for the probability of being on the inﬁnite cluster P ∞ and the probability of being on the overconstrained part of the inﬁnite cluster P ov . Results are for co - ordination number z = 3 and with g = 1 degrees of freedom per site . The probability that a bond is present is p , and percolation occurs at p c = 0 . 5 . 7 In the connectivity case f ( 1 ) ( p ) and the order param - eters T 0 , P ov and P ∞ are continuous at the transition , and so connectivity percolation is of a conventional sec - ond order type , as indeed it is on real lattices like the triangular network . [ 13 ] V . RIGIDITY PERCOLATION In the rigidity case we must numerically solve Eq . ( 16 ) for T 0 and hence ﬁnd the other quantities of interest . We ﬁrst solve the self - consistent Eq . ( 16 ) , by simple itera - tion , to ﬁnd T 0 , which is shown in Fig . 6 for g = 2 and z = 6 . The analogue of the Maxwell construction ( 4 ) is then used to ﬁnd p c . This is shown as the jump in Fig . 6 at p c = 0 . 656 . The other possible solutions are ruled out by application of ( 4 ) and hence we have a ﬁrst order jump from a rigid to a ﬂoppy state . The point at p s = 0 . 603 can be interpreted as a spinodal point . [ 24 ] The dashed line is unstable as can be seen from Eq . ( 22 ) . Having found T 0 and p c , we can ﬁnd f ( p ) , f ( 1 ) ( p ) , f ( 2 ) ( p ) and r ( p ) as shown in Fig . 7 . It can be seen that there are no redundant bonds for p ≤ p c and hence f ( 1 ) and f ( 2 ) are ﬂat in this region , as also happens for connec - tivity percolation as shown in Sec . IV . In Fig . 7 , we also show the results from the random bond model , discussed in Sec . III , and ﬁnd that the results are equivalent as expected . Note that with the random bond model , the ﬁrst order transition occurs naturally and no Maxwell construction is needed , as the pebble game always ﬁnds the bulk equilibrium solution . 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 p 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 T O FIG . 6 . Results for bond diluted rigidity percolation on a Bethe lattice for T 0 are shown for co - ordination number z = 6 with g = 2 degrees of freedom per site . The probability that a bond is present is p and percolation occurs at p c = 0 . 656 shown by the vertical line . The thin line extends out to the spinodal point at p s = 0 . 603 and the dashed line shows the unstable solution . In Fig . 8 , we show results for P ∞ and P ov from Eqs . ( 23 ) and ( 24 ) respectively . It can be seen that most of the inﬁnite cluster is overconstrained , even at the ﬁrst order transition . In the connectivity case as shown in Figs . 3 and 5 , the order parameter [ T 0 , P ∞ or P ov ] is continuous at p c , whereas in the rigidity case as shown in Figs . 6 and 8 the order parameter has a large ﬁrst - order jump at p c . The quantity f ( 1 ) ( p ) , which acts like an energy , also has a large ﬁrst order jump . One could argue that in the rigidity case , a metastable rigid state exists for any p c > p > p s . Note that for connectivity percolation , the boundary conditions are irrelevant , and no diﬀerence is found with or without a rigid busbar . This is not so for rigidity percolation , where there are three real solutions [ 25 ] for all p s < p < 1 , with an unstable solution at ﬁnite T 0 existing in this regime as shown by the dashed line in Fig . 6 . In order for the stable ﬁnite T 0 solution to be found , the boundary rigidity must lie above the unstable ﬁxed point . Any boundary rigidity below this value iterates to the T 0 = 0 solution . This curious eﬀect of the boundary condition in rigidity percolation , even on the bulk Bethe lattice solution , needs further study . 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 p 0 1 2 3 4 5 −1 . 5 −1 . 0 −0 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 f ( p ) r ( p ) f ( 1 ) ( p ) f ( 2 ) ( p ) FIG . 7 .

( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ] for the number of ﬂoppy modes is a straight line follows the f ( p ) at small p . 8 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 p 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 P r obab ili t y 8 P P ov FIG . 8 . Results for bond diluted rigidity percolation on a Bethe lattice for the probability of being on the inﬁnite cluster P ∞ and the probability of being on the overconstrained part of the inﬁnite cluster P ov . Results are for co - ordination number z = 6 with g = 2 degrees of freedom per site . The probability that a bond is present is p , and percolation occurs at p c = 0 . 656 . It is useful to compare the results for p c with that predicted by Maxwell counting . Maxwell counting would predict p m = 2 g / z = 2 / 3 in both cases studied here . In the connectivity case this is markedly diﬀerent than the exact result p c = 1 / 2 because there are many ﬂoppy modes at p c in that case as can be seen from Fig . 4 . In contrast , in the rigidity case , the Maxwell estimate is close to the Bethe lattice result p c = 0 . 655 and there are rather few ﬂoppy modes at p c as shown in Fig . 7 . It is remarkable that Maxwell counting does so well in locating the position of both ﬁrst order and second order [ 6 , 18 ] rigidity transitions . Results of calculations for a range of values of g and z for bond diluted Bethe lattices are summarized in table 1 . In all rigidity cases ( i . e . g > 1 ) there is a large jump in the order parameter T 0 , P ∞ or P ov at the critical point p c , although the jump does decrease with increasing z for a given g . On real lattices , there will also be a Lifshitz tail [ 20 ] in the number of redundant bonds r ( p ) [ see Figs . ( 4 ) and ( 7 ) ] extending into the regime p < p c all the way to p = 0 . Notice that the Bethe lattice result does correctly reproduce the Lifshitz tail in f ( p ) in the region p c ≤ p ≤ 1 . It is seen from Fig . 7 that the random - bond model is numerically equivalent to the Bethe lattice results , as ex - pected from our previous discussion . The pebble game is an exact algorithm for a particular network and gives the exact number of ﬂoppy modes ( and the associated derivatives ) . There is therefore no hysteresis in the re - sults of the pebble game on the random bond model , and in these large samples , the system ﬂips from the rigid state to the ﬂoppy state around p c = 0 . 656 as a single bond is removed in a given sample . This is a very un - usual situation as most numerical techniques , like Mont´e Carlo encounter hysteresis near a ﬁrst order transition . [ 26 ] VI . LARGE Z LIMIT It is instructive to take the limit as the number of neighbors z increases to inﬁnity . In order to make this limit sensible , it is necessary to change from the p variable to r = zp , which is the mean coordination of a site . For connectivity percolation , with g = 1 , Eq . ( 16 ) becomes T 0 = 1 − e − rT 0 ( 40 ) which leads to a r c = zp c = 1 which diﬀers from the Maxwell estimate of r m = zp m = 2 by a factor 2 . Of more intertest to us is the case g = 2 corresponding to rigidity , where Eq . ( 16 ) becomes T 0 = 1 − ( 1 + rT 0 ) e − rT 0 . ( 41 ) Eq . ( 41 ) can be solved for T 0 and the spinodal point found explicitly by diﬀerentiation . In this large z limit , the analog of the Maxwell condition given in Eq . ( 26 ) becomes Z ∞ r c (cid:0) 1 − T 20 (cid:1) dr = 2 g − r c . ( 42 ) Eqs . ( 41 ) and ( 42 ) can be solved simultaneously to locate the ﬁrst order transition at r c , and the result is listed in Table 1 . We also show the results for the number of ﬂoppy modes f at the transition and at the spinodal point , using Eq . ( 27 ) . The values of P ∞ and P ov are obtained using Eqs . ( 23 ) and ( 24 ) respectively . It can be seen from Table 1 that the values of all these quantities evolve smoothly as z → ∞ . For larger values of g , we use Eq . ( 16 ) to generalise Eq . ( 41 ) to arbitary g T 0 = 1 − g − 1 X k = 0 ( rT 0 ) k k ! ! e − rT 0 . ( 43 ) Notice that Eq . ( 43 ) reduces to Eqs . ( 40 ) and ( 42 ) re - spectively for g = 1 and g = 2 . Solving Eqs . ( 43 ) and ( 42 ) simultaineously , we ﬁnd the results for g = 3 and 6 listed in Table 1 . By examining the equations in this section , we can ﬁnd that as g increases , the values of the mean coordination at the spinodal point r s and at the ﬁrst order transition r c so that in the limit g = ∞ , we have 2 r s = r c = r m = 2 g ( 44 ) and we recover the Maxwell result given in Eqs . ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . Here r m is deﬁned by r m = zp m . It is interesting 9 to note that the spinodal point is always distinct from the transition , and diﬀers by a factor 2 in this limit . We obtained the limiting value of r s by carefully tracking Eq . ( 43 ) for large g , and ﬁnd that the limit is approached very slowly . In this limit the metastable region between the spinodal and the ﬁrst order transition exists between r s and r c , and we have the Maxwell result which is also ﬁrst order of course . Note that in this limit g → ∞ , we have T 0 = 0 for r < r c and T 0 = 1 for r > r c , so that the system is either perfectly ﬂoppy for r < r c when there are no re - dundant bonds ( this is true for arbitary z and g ) and now also perfectly rigid for r > r c in this limit with z → ∞ and g → ∞ when there are are no ﬂoppy regions . This limit in which the system behaves homogeneously and the ﬂuctuations are suppressed , may be regarded as the mean ﬁeld limit for rigidity . VII . CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have shown that the free energy is negative of the number of ﬂoppy modes . This general - izes a previous result [ 7 ] which gives the free energy as the total number of clusters in connectivity percolation , where there is a single ﬂoppy mode associated with each isolated cluster . In connectivity percolation , the free en - ergy can also be found as the limit as s → 1 of the s state Potts model . [ 8 ] No equivalent approach has been possible for rigidity . We have used the free energy , and the associated Maxwell type construction , or self consistency condition , to show that the rigidity transition is always ﬁrst order on Bethe lattices . It is necessary to use this construction in order to remove boundary constraints . In previous work , [ 2 , 25 ] a boundary dependent transition was found at the spinodal point p s . As is expected from experience with thermodynamic transitions , metastability and boundary eﬀects can be important [ 24 ] in the regime p s < p < p c , and this needs further investigation . While rigidity concepts have been extensively applied to experiments in chalcogenide glasses [ 18 , 19 ] , ﬁrst or - der jumps in experimental quantities have never been observed ( although see recent Raman results in chalco - genide glasses [ 27 ] ) .
