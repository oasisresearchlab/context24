We demonstrate that a sampling - based mechanism can o ﬀ er an alternative explanation for belief synchronization in social groups and the persistence of collective illusions . Our model assumes that people are more likely to sample popular alternatives than unpopular alternatives . We show that this mechanism is su ﬃ cient to explain belief synchronization : a strong majority of opinions will likely emerge in favor of one alter - native . The reason is that the group is unlikely to move away from a state in which one alternative is very unpopular . If by chance most people come to dislike alternative A , they are all unlikely to sample it again and their opinions of A remain the same . When A is in fact the best alternative , a collective illusion has emerged because people mistakenly believe that a suboptimal alternative is the best . Our model implies that such a collective illusion is persistent . The model thus o ﬀ ers an existence proof that a collective illusion can occur even in settings where people do not infer that popular alternatives are better . The model also casts new light on the e ﬀ ect of online recommendation systems on attitude homogenization and the e ﬀ ect of majority voting on beliefs and attitudes .

Introduction Explaining why collective mistakes emerge and persist is central to understanding social change , immobility , and di ﬀ erences in welfare ( Bowles 2004 , Elster 1978 , North 1990 ) . In developing countries , people keep on using poor domestic hygiene practices even though simple changes would save many lives ( Curtis et al . 2000 ) , and farmers fail to use fertilizer despite their potential for large increases in productivity ( Duﬂo et al . 2011 ) . In Western countries , ﬁrms persist in mak - ing abundant use of temporary workforces despite the ine ﬃ ciency of this arrangement ( Pfe ﬀ er 1998 ) , and medical practices and treatments tend to cluster geo - graphically , sometimes in favor of suboptimal alter - natives ( Coleman et al . 1966 , O’Connor et al . 1999 , Krumholz et al . 2003 ) . How come groups of people could persist in using ine ﬃ cient technologies , prac - tices , or institutions when better courses of actions are available ? Prior literature has shown that such mistakes can occur when there are network externalities ( Arthur 1989 , Elster 1978 , North 1990 , Pierson 2004 ) or when a collective illusion emerges in which individuals mis - takenly infer that the most popular but suboptimal alternative is the best ( Banerjee 1992 , Bikhchandani et al . 1992 , Cialdini and Goldstein 2004 , Festinger 1957 ) . In the ﬁrst case , people are likely to herd , i . e . , select the popular alternative , even if they know it is infe - rior to an unpopular alternative because it is di ﬃ - cult to coordinate a switch to the superior alterna - tive . In the second case , people are assumed to make inferences about quality on the basis of popularity . More precisely , if a suboptimal alternative has , by chance , become the most popular one , people who have limited information about the qualities of the alternatives will mistakenly infer that the suboptimal but popular alternative is superior to other , less pop - ular alternatives . This leads to herd behavior where most people chose the same alternative . Such infer - ence can be rational , as in information cascade models ( Banerjee 1992 , Bikhchandani et al . 1992 ) , but it can also be the product of belief adjustments , whereby peo - ple tend to process information about popular alter - natives in a systematically di ﬀ erent fashion from how they process information about unpopular alternatives ( Bem 1972 , Elster 1983 , Festinger 1957 , Heider 1958 , Samuelson and Zeckhauser 1988 ) . Here , we demonstrate theoretically that an alterna - tive explanation for collective illusions is possible , an explanation that builds on the sampling perspective 528 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 84 . 89 . 157 . 34 ] on 21 M a r c h 2017 , a t 09 : 10 .

We consider settings where people learn about the qualities of the alternatives from experience . In con - trast to prior work , we assume that popularity does not impact inferences about qualities , but only impacts sampling . In particular , we assume that due to con - formity pressures or network externalities , people are more likely to sample alternatives the majority believes to be superior . We demonstrate theoretically that this mechanism , by itself , is su ﬃ cient to explain the emer - gence and persistence of collective illusions . Speciﬁ - cally , we show that if people tend to select popular alternatives , beliefs tend to become synchronized : a strong majority of people will tend to believe that one or the other alternative is the best , even if the qual - ities of the alternatives are the same . When a strong majority emerges in favor of the inferior alternative , a collective illusion has emerged . Our model shows that such a collective illusion is persistent in the sense that it tends to last for a long time . Importantly , our theoretical results hold even if peo - ple do not engage in belief adjustments of the sort described above nor make inferences about quality on the basis of popularity . Our assumptions are thus very di ﬀ erent from the assumptions of information cas - cade models . These models assume that people select the alternative that the majority of others has selected because of the inferences they make on the basis of popularity ( Bikhchandani et al . 1992 ) . Our model thus provides an existence proof that beliefs can become synchronized even in settings where people are reluc - tant to infer that what is popular is best for them , such as when they have di ﬀ erent tastes or skills . The intuition behind our results is that when pop - ularity impacts sampling , a population is unlikely to move away from a state in which one alternative is very unpopular compared to other alternatives . If by chance most people come to dislike alternative A , they are all unlikely to sample it again and their opinions of A remain the same . When A is in fact the best alternative , a collective illusion has emerged because people mis - takenly believe that a suboptimal alternative is the best . Such a collective illusion is persistent because people avoid alternative A and do not correct their mistaken negative assessment of alternative A . Our model builds upon prior work which has demonstrated how sampling can systematically impact belief formation when people learn from experience ( Denrell 2005 , Denrell and Le Mens 2007 , Fiedler 2000 , Fazio et al . 2004 , Le Mens and Denrell 2011 ) . The key mechanism in much of this literature is the asymme - try in experiential learning generated by adaptive sam - pling . To ensure favorable future outcomes , it makes sense to choose alternatives with favorable past out - comes and avoid alternatives with unfavorable past outcomes . Such adaptive sampling implies that neg - ative attitudes are more likely than positive attitudes to remain stable . If I dislike A , I am unlikely to sam - ple A again , and my negative attitude toward A does not change . Prior literature has used this mechanism to o ﬀ er alternative explanations of a range of social psychological phenomena . For example , Denrell ( 2005 ) shows how in - group bias could be explained by adap - tive sampling . The intuition is that attitudes will be more positive toward people you are likely to meet irrespective of your attitude toward them . If I dis - like B , but B is a friend of my friends , I might meet B again . As a result , my negative attitude toward B can change . This would not happen if B were not part of my social network . They key mechanism is that attitudes will become more positive for alternatives the decision maker is “forced” to sample . In this paper we consider a population of individuals who are all more likely to select alternatives that many others like . As in prior sampling models , sampling behavior is determined by outcomes in prior peri - ods . Unlike prior models , however , there is no inbuilt bias toward sampling a particular set of alternatives ( such as people belonging to the in - group ) . Rather , the sampling bias emerges endogenously ( it is deter - mined by what people sample and what outcomes they receive ) . We ask whether and when such an endoge - nously emerging sampling bias can generate a persis - tent collective illusion . Our model thus di ﬀ ers from prior models both conceptually ( no inbuilt sampling bias in favor of a speciﬁc alternative ) and in the focus on a collective ( rather than individuals ) . Analyzing a model with an endogenously emerging sampling bias also requires mathematical techniques di ﬀ erent from what was used in prior literature . In the following , we ﬁrst explain the rationale behind our assumption that people tend to select alternatives that many others like while not using popularity as a signal of quality nor engaging in belief adjustments . In Section 3 , we analyze a simple learning model that gives rise to an information bias that leads to syn - chronized beliefs and to the emergence of collective illusions . In Section 4 , we discuss some extensions to more realistic assumptions regarding choices and belief updating mechanisms . In Section 5 we discuss how our theory relates to prior research on the emer - gence of collective illusions . In Section 6 , we show how our model can be adapted to explain how major - ity voting can lead to attitude homogenization within groups . Finally , in Section 7 , we discuss the di ﬃ cul - ties associated with empirically disentangling the sam - pling e ﬀ ect at the core of our approach and the e ﬀ ect of popularity on quality estimates that is mediated by popularity - based inferences like those at the core of herding models .

Majority Inﬂuence and Information Sampling Much prior research on why people might come to agree with a mistaken majority assumes that people change their beliefs to conform to the majority opin - ion . Theories of social learning in economics and of majority inﬂuence in psychology , for example , assume that people use popularity as an indication of quality : if most others like alternative A better than alterna - tive B , people infer that alternative A is likely supe - rior ( Banerjee 1992 , Bikhchandani et al . 1992 , Darley and Latané 1968 , Deutsch and Gerard 1955 , Prentice and Miller 1993 ) . Such inference about quality on the basis of popularity is often sensible : if most others like and go to restaurant A and few others like and go to restaurant B , this suggests that A o ﬀ ers superior food and service . An abundant literature in economics has shown that , at the population level , such inferences can lead to information cascades in which most agents come to mistakenly believe that a suboptimal alter - native is optimal ( a collective illusion has emerged ) . A key insight of this literature is that such information cascades , associated collective illusions and resulting herd behavior can be the outcome of rational behavior ( Banerjee 1992 , Bikhchandani et al . 1992 ; for a review , see Chamley 2004 ) . Although popularity - based inferences are often sen - sible , here we wish to demonstrate that such inferences are not necessary to explain the synchronization of opin - ions in a population . For this purpose , our model delib - erately excludes such inferences . Speciﬁcally , we do not assume that people change their beliefs when hearing about the behaviors of others : in our model , people’s quality estimates are based only on the information they obtain by sampling the alternatives . We assume , however , that people are subject to majority inﬂuence in the sense that they are more likely to select and thus sample an activity that is popular , i . e . , believed to be of superior quality by most other people . Thus , our model assumes majority inﬂuence , but it does not assume a direct e ﬀ ect of popularity on beliefs ( beliefs depend only on one’s information sample ) . Why assume that the majority only impacts sam - pling behavior and not beliefs ? In cases where popu - larity - based inferences are important , this assumption may not be realistic since popularity then likely im - pacts both behavior and beliefs . For theoretical pur - poses , however , it is useful to examine the case where popularity only inﬂuences behavior . We will show that this assumption , combined with individual learn - ing from experience , is su ﬃ cient to explain emer - gence of belief synchronization . This strategy that con - sists in assuming away intrapsychic belief adjustments is standard in the research tradition in which our paper ﬁts ( Fiedler and Juslin 2006 , Juslin et al . 2007 ) . Like other information sampling models , our theory emphasizes the role of the environment and how it can sometimes produce systematically biased samples of information that a ﬀ ect judgments ( for a review , see Fiedler and Juslin 2006 ; for recent publications that adopt this perspective , see Denrell and Le Mens 2011 ; Eder et al . 2011 ; Feiler et al . 2013 ; Fiedler 2008 , 2011 , 2012 ; Henriksson et al . 2010 ; Le Mens and Denrell 2011 ; Smith and Collins 2009 ) . There are also many realistic situations where one might expect to see the majority impact sampling be - havior although people do not engage in popularity - based inferences . Prior studies have shown that people might publicly adhere to the local norm , by stating an opinion in agreement with the majority or choosing the action chosen by most others , while privately disagree - ing or having di ﬀ erent preferences . In the Asch ( 1956 ) conformity experiments , for example , many partici - pants did not believe that the majority was correct , but nevertheless stated an opinion in agreement with the majority opinion to avoid being seen as a deviant . More generally , studies have shown that people who deviate from the majority opinion are less liked ( Levine 1980 ) and also expect to be disliked ( Gerard and Rotter 1961 ) , so it is hardly surprising that people conform publicly even if they privately are of a di ﬀ erent opinion . People may also go along with the majority because there is “safety in numbers” in the sense that it can be costly to choose an activity few others will choose ( Granovetter 1978 , Schelling 1978 ) . For example , a research student will ﬁnd it easier to get help if she chooses a research method used by many faculty and students in her department . The advantage of having help around may motivate her to choose this method even if she does not believe that it is overall superior . People might also choose the popular alternative because “it is bet - ter for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally” ( Keynes 1936 , p . 158 ) , i . e . , because of the adverse reputation e ﬀ ects of receiving a poor outcome with an unusual alternative ( Scharfstein and Stein 1990 , Zwiebel 1995 ) . Finally , people might select popular alternatives because they are more easily avail - able or visible . For example , people are more likely to be aware of popular songs because they are played more often on radio , etc . Popular alternatives are often also more prominently displayed on websites ( such as Google , Spotify , etc ) . Besides , although popularity - based inferences are often sensible , there are settings in which it is doubt - ful whether the majority knows best or knows what is good for you . People may have unique tastes ( Berger and Heath 2007 ) : if others prefer opera to jazz , this may not be enough to convince you that opera is superior . But you might nevertheless go to the opera because you want to be able to talk about it with your friends . Individuals may also suspect that the experiences of others are not relevant because their D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 84 . 89 . 157 . 34 ] on 21 M a r c h 2017 , a t 09 : 10 .

Denrell and Le Mens : Information Sampling , Belief Synchronization , and Collective Illusions Management Science 63 ( 2 ) , pp . 528 – 547 , © 2017 INFORMS 531 circumstances are di ﬀ erent . For example , because of wide variations in soil conditions , rice growers dur - ing the Indian green revolution were hesitant to adopt techniques simply because they had worked well at neighboring plots ( Munshi 2004 ) . Rather than imi - tating others , they relied on their own experience . Such hesitance to rely on the experience of others is likely common and also sensible especially when the experiences of others contradict your own expe - rience : the fact that the experiences of others dif - fer from yours indicates that your circumstances may di ﬀ er substantially . The possibility of di ﬀ erent circum - stances was also one of the explanations that partic - ipants in the Asch ( 1956 ) experiments came up with to make sense of the behavior of the majority : the fact that the majority disagreed with them indicated that the majority interpreted the question di ﬀ erently or viewed the lines from a di ﬀ erent angle . Individ - uals may also rely more than they should on their own experience simply because it is salient ( Simonsohn et al . 2008 ) . These arguments suggest that there are settings in which popularity - based inferences are unlikely to be important , but people might nevertheless select the popular alternative to avoid being seen as deviant , to coordinate their choices with others , or because popu - lar alternatives are more easily available . In these cases , popularity will inﬂuence sampling but not beliefs once sampling is controlled for . A good illustration is the MusicLab experiment ( Salganik et al . 2006 ) . In this experiment , thousands of participants could listen to songs by streaming them and then decide to down - load ( or not ) the songs to which they had listened . Songs that had been downloaded by many partici - pants ( i . e . , the popular songs ) were more accessible in that they were displayed at the top of the computer screen ( Experiment 2 ) . Recent reanalyses of the exper - imental data suggest that participants made their lis - tening ( i . e . , sampling ) decisions based on popularity . But their evaluations of the songs were not driven by social inﬂuence : there was no e ﬀ ect of popularity once sampling was controlled for ( Hendricks et al . 2012 , Krumme et al . 2012 ) . 3 . Model We consider a population of n people who learn about the qualities of two uncertain alternatives from the private information they obtain by sampling the alter - natives . In each period , one individual is randomly picked in the population . This individual selects one of the two alternatives , observes its payo ﬀ , and updates her estimate of the quality of this alternative accord - ingly . We implement the e ﬀ ect of network externalities by assuming that the individual is more likely to sam - ple the alternative that is believed by most to be the superior one . We focus on the essential features of the learning and choice processes that can give rise to col - lective illusions . Therefore , we keep our model as sim - ple as possible in this section . In Section 4 we discuss the assumptions of the model and what happens if we make di ﬀ erent assumptions . 3 . 1 . Model Speciﬁcation Our model is based on the following assumptions . Payo   s of the Alternatives . The two alternatives po - tentially di ﬀ er in “quality” or “e ﬃ ciency . ” The two alternatives have payo ﬀ s that follow Bernoulli distribu - tions : the possible payo ﬀ s are 0 ( failure ) and 1 ( success ) . Let p 1 be the probability of success of alternative 1 and p 2 the probability of success of alternative 2 . We will say that alternative 1 is superior ( inferior ) when p 1 > p 2 ( p 1 < p 2 ) . An important feature of the model is that the success probabilities , p 1 and p 2 , are unknown to the decision makers . Quality Estimates . Estimates of the qualities of the alternatives are binary : an individual believes an alter - native is either “good” or “bad” ( and so she can believe that both are “good , ” both are “bad , ” or one is “good” while the other is “bad” ) . The estimate of alterna - tive 1 ( alternative 2 ) for individual i at the beginning of period t will be denoted by ˆ Q i 1 , t ( ˆ Q i 2 , t ) . If the estimate of alternative 1 ( alternative 2 ) is “good , ” we will write ˆ Q i 1 , t ⇤ 1 ( ˆ Q i 2 , t ⇤ 1 ) , and if the estimate is “bad , ” we will write ˆ Q i 1 , t ⇤ 0 ( ˆ Q i 2 , t ⇤ 0 ) . Initial estimates are random draws from the payo ﬀ distributions . More precisely , for a given individual , the likelihood that the initial esti - mate of alternative 1 is “good” is p 1 . The likelihood that the initial estimate is “bad” is 1   p 1 . If p 1 ⇤ 0 . 5 , then an individual initially believes that alternative 1 is “good” or “bad” with equal probability . Sampling Rule . In each period , one individual is ran - domly picked in the population ( each individual is equally likely to be picked ) . This individual makes a choice between the two available alternatives . The cru - cial assumption is the following : we assume that the individual is more likely to sample the popular alter - native than the unpopular alternative . Speciﬁcally , let N 1 , t be the number of individuals who have a “good” estimate for alternative 1 at the beginning of period t , and let N 2 , t be the number of individuals who have a “good” estimate for alternative 2 at the beginning of period t . 1 We assume that the likelihood that an indi - vidual chooses the ﬁrst alternative is pC 1 ( n 1 , t , n 2 , t ) ⇤ 1 1 + e   s ( n 1 , t   n 2 , t ) , ( 1 ) where s > 0 is the sensitivity to popularity . We set pC 2 ( n 1 , t , n 2 , t ) ⇤ 1   pC 1 ( n 1 , t , n 2 , t ) . This logistic choice rule is often used to model choice under uncertainty ( Erev and Barron 2005 , Sutton and Barto 1998 ) and provides good ﬁt to experimental data on sequential D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 84 . 89 . 157 . 34 ] on 21 M a r c h 2017 , a t 09 : 10 .

It also ﬁts data on the e ﬀ ect of the number of inﬂuence sources on conformity behavior ( MacCoun 2012 ) . 2 Estimate Updating Rule . We assume that quality esti - mates are based on the most recent observation . If indi - vidual i samples alternative k and gets a success , her estimate becomes “good” ( e . g . , for alternative 1 , ˆ Q i 1 , t ⇤ 1 ) . If she gets a failure , her estimate becomes “bad” ( e . g . , for alternative 1 , ˆ Q i 1 , t ⇤ 0 ) . We make this assumption to keep the model as transparent as possi - ble , but the basic results continue to hold if individu - als use a weighted average estimate updating rule , as shown in Section 4 . 1 . Although this assumption that only the most recent observation matters might seem simplistic , recent experimental evidence on sequential choice between uncertain alternatives with binary out - comes shows that choices are well predicted by a model that focuses on the most recent outcome only , like ours ( Avrahami and Kareev 2010 ) . 3 . 2 . Results In what follows , we ﬁrst present an analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the model because the such an analysis leads to easily interpretable formulas that make it easier to understand the pattern of behavior implied by the model . Then we demonstrate , using numerical computations , that our main results emerge after a reasonable number of periods . 3 . 2 . 1 . Asymptotic Analysis . To demonstrate the syn - chronization of quality estimates , we computed the stationary distribution of the popularities of the two alternatives . Let N 1 and N 2 denote the random vari - ables toward which N 1 , t and N 2 , t converge , and let ¯ f t ( n 1 , n 2 ) denote the joint stationary distribution of the popularities of N 1 and N 2 .

Right panel : The marginal distribution of N 1   N 2 is also bimodal . Proposition 1 ( Joint Stationary Distribution of Populari - ties ) . When sampling follows the logistic choice rule ￿ Equa - tion ￿￿￿￿ , the stationary distribution of the popularities of the two alternatives , N 1 and N 2 , is ¯ f ( n 1 , n 2 ) ⇤ K ( e   sn 1 + e   sn 2 ) ( p 1 ) n 1 ( 1   p 1 ) n   n 1 · ( p 2 ) n 2 ( 1   p 2 ) n   n 2 ✓ nn 1 ◆ ✓ nn 2 ◆ , ( 2 ) where K   1 ⇤ ( 1   p 1 + p 1 e   s ) n + ( 1   p 2 + p 2 e   s ) n . Proof . The proofs are in the appendix . This distribution implies that a strong majority favor - ing one or the other alternatives is likely to emerge ( see Figure 1 , left panel ) . To understand why , note that this is a weighted bivariate binomial distribution , where the weight is K ( e   sn 1 + e   sn 2 ) . The weighting function puts additional weights on the extremes ( where N k ⇤ 0 ) and implies that the joint distribution of popularities will be bi - modal if s is high enough . The ﬁrst mode is close to ( N 1 ⇤ p 1 n , N 2 ⇤ 0 ) : in this case , the propor - tion of people who like alternative 1 is p 1 , whereas the proportion of those who like alternative 2 is small . The other mode is located at ( N 1 ⇤ 0 , N 2 ⇤ p 2 n ) : in this case the proportion of people who like alternative 1 is small , whereas the proportion who like alternative 2 is p 2 . 3 The right panel of Figure 1 shows the distribution of the di ﬀ erence in popularities , N 1   N 2 , which is also bimodal . One mode is above 0 ; this corresponds to cases where alternative 1 is the more popular . The other mode is below 0 ; this corresponds to cases where alternative 1 is the less popular . In the setting of the graph , alternative 1 is inferior to alternative 2 ( p 1 ⇤ 0 . 4 and p 2 ⇤ 0 . 45 ) . Unsurprisingly , the mode above 0 is lower than the mode below 0 ; alternative 1 is less likely than alternative 2 to become the more popular . But the probability that alternative 1 becomes more popular D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 84 . 89 . 157 . 34 ] on 21 M a r c h 2017 , a t 09 : 10 .

Denrell and Le Mens : Information Sampling , Belief Synchronization , and Collective Illusions Management Science 63 ( 2 ) , pp . 528 – 547 , © 2017 INFORMS 533 than alternative 2 is still substantial ( the probability is 0 . 29 ) despite the fact that alternative 1 is the inferior alternative . When alternative 1 is more popular despite being inferior , a collective illusion has emerged : most people mistakenly believe alternative 1 to be superior to alternative 2 . We formalize the deﬁnition of collective illusion as follows : Deﬁnition 1 ( Collective Illusion ) . We will say that the system is in a collective illusion state when either of the following two situations arises : • p 1 < p 2 and N 1 > N 2 , • p 1 > p 2 and N 1 < N 2 . The intuition for Proposition 1 is that when popu - larity impacts sampling the system is unlikely to move away from a state in which one alternative is unpop - ular . This is related to the bimodal character of the asymptotic joint distribution of popularities . To explain this , suppose p 1 < p 2 and N 1 ⇤ np 1 while N 2 is low ( i . e . , N 1 > N 2 ) . Thus , alternative 1 is the most popular , and alternative 2 is believed by many to be “bad . ” The system can only exit from such a collective illusion if N 2 increases or N 1 decreases . These events are unlikely to happen , however . To see why , note ﬁrst that when alternative 2 is unpopular , it is unlikely to be selected . So , N 2 is unlikely to increase . Next , note that whereas alterna - tive 1 is likely to be selected ( because it is popular ) , N 1 is unlikely to decrease to a value much below np 1 . When alternative 1 is selected , the probability that N 1 decreases by one is ( N 1 / n ) ( 1   p 1 ) whereas the prob - ability that N 1 increases by one is ( 1   N 1 / n ) p 1 . An increase is more likely than a decrease whenever N 1 < np 1 , a decrease is more likely if N 1 > np 1 , and a decrease is as likely as an increase when N 1 ⇤ np 1 . In other words , when alternative 1 is selected , N 1 tends to regress to its mean , which equals np 1 . Overall , this implies that the Figure 2 .

This reasoning also shows that a collective illusion is a not temporary chance occurrence that will be quickly corrected . Rather , collective illusions produced by our model tend to be self - sustaining : once a collective illu - sion has emerged , the system is very slow to exit this state . To illustrate the persistence of collective illusions , we computed the expected time the system stays in the collective illusion state once a collective illusion has emerged . In what follows , we assume that alternative 2 is superior to alternative 1 ( p 1 < p 2 ) . 4 The left panel of Figure 2 reports the results of these computations . The graph displays the expected num - ber periods the collective illusion persists , given that we know that there is a collective illusion , as a function of the slope parameter of the logistic sampling rule ( s ) . The graph shows that collective illusions tend to persist longer when sampling strongly depends on popularity ( s is high ) . It is useful to note that even when choices are independent ( s ⇤ 0 ) , it still takes some time for the system to exit the collective illusion ( because only one individual can sample and change beliefs in each period ) . But the crucial feature of this ﬁgure is that col - lective illusions persist much longer when people tend to sample popular alternatives . The right panel of Figure 2 shows how this pattern changes with the di ﬀ erence between the qualities of the two alternatives . Intuition suggests that when the alter - natives have very di ﬀ erent qualities , collective illusions are unlikely to persist . The reason is that , in this case , it is very easy for the agents to learn from their expe - rience that the alternatives are di ﬀ erent . We ﬁnd that this is the case .

When   is small , the two alternatives have very similar qualities , and when   is larger , alternative 2 is much better than alternative 1 .

But when   is large , col - lective illusions do not persist , even if people have a strong tendency to select the popular alternative ( i . e . , s is high ) . We have just seen that the di ﬀ erence between the qualities a ﬀ ects the persistence of collective illusions once they occur . But how frequent are collective illu - sions ?

The stationary joint distribution of the popularities of alternative 1 and alternative 2 is bimodal . Right panel : The marginal distribution of N 1   N 2 is also bimodal as soon as the number of periods is large enough . system is in a collective illusion state , as implied by the asymptotic distribution of popularities . Collective illusions are less likely to occur when the alternatives have very di ﬀ erent qualities and more likely to occur when the qualities are similar . The intuition for this result is again that is easier for agents to learn which alternative is the best when the qualities are very di ﬀ er - ent because each observation is more diagnostic than when the alternatives have similar qualities . Overall , this discussion implies that collective illu - sions are more likely to emerge and persist when the di ﬀ erence between the qualities of the alternatives is small . Our model shares this feature with some of the existing models that predict the emergence and per - sistence of collective illusions . In particular , the graph of Figure 3 is very similar to Figure 1 in Bikhchandani et al . ( 1992 ) , which plots the likelihood of an incor - rect cascade as a function of the accuracy of the signal received by the agents . Our model , however , relies on a di ﬀ erent mechanism and makes predictions that are distinct from the predictions of information cascade models ( see Section 5 . 3 ) . 3 . 2 . 2 . Dynamics of the Model : Numerical Computa - tions . So far , we have discussed properties of the asymptotic distribution of popularities because it has an easily interpretable formulation as a weighted bimodal distribution . Although it does not seem pos - sible to derive a similarly interpretable formula for the distribution of popularities in any given period , it is easy to compute the distribution numerically ( by com - puting successive powers of the transition matrix implied by the above assumptions ) . The left panel of Figure 4 shows the joint distribution of popularities at the beginning of period 100 , assuming that all agents D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 84 . 89 . 157 . 34 ] on 21 M a r c h 2017 , a t 09 : 10 .

Denrell and Le Mens : Information Sampling , Belief Synchronization , and Collective Illusions Management Science 63 ( 2 ) , pp . 528 – 547 , © 2017 INFORMS 535 in the model start with independent beliefs . The joint distribution of popularities is similar to the asymptotic distribution of Figure 1 . It is bimodal . One mode is such that N 1 is close to np 1 and N 2 is low . The other mode is such that N 1 is low and N 2 is close to np 2 . We can illustrate how the e ﬀ ect unfolds over time by plotting the distribution of N 1 , t   N 2 , t for vari - ous values of t . The right panel of Figure 4 shows that the distribution of the di ﬀ erence is initially uni - modal , and it becomes bimodal after a number of peri - ods somewhere between 50 and 100 . This means that after about 10 decisions per agent , if a collective illu - sion emerges , it will have a self - sustaining character . The self - sustaining character of the collective illusion becomes stronger as the distribution becomes more strongly bimodal . The bimodal character of the distri - bution becomes more pronounced as the number of period grows . After about 1 , 000 periods , the distribu - tion has essentially reached its asymptotic state . 3 . 2 . 3 . Positive Dependence Between Quality Esti - mates . The synchronization of estimates across indi - viduals is most clearly illustrated by analyzing the correlation between quality estimates of pairs of indi - viduals . The model implies that quality estimates for a given alternative become positively correlated . This occurs despite the fact that the individuals in the model make independent observations of the payo ﬀ s of the alternatives . 5 Conversely , the quality estimates for competing alternatives become negatively correlated . Proposition 2 ( Correlation Between Quality Estimates of Two Individuals ) . ( i ) The pairwise correlations between sta - tionary quality estimates for a given alternative are positive . For all i , j , and for k 2 { 1 , 2 } , corr ( ˆ Q ik , ˆ Q j k ) > 0 . Figure 5 .

( ii ) The pairwise correlations between stationary quality estimatesforcompetingalternativesarenegative . Forall i , j , corr ( ˆ Q i 1 , ˆ Q j 2 ) < 0 . Although these results about correlation between quality estimates are elegantly formulated , our as - sumption that the payo ﬀ distribution is binary implies that correlations are almost surely very low . As such , the correlations do not provide a good intuitive sense about the size of the e ﬀ ect . The following corollary provides an alternate formulation of the same idea in terms of odds ratios . Corollary 1 ( Dependency Between Quality Estimates ) . The odds that a given individual believes an alternative is “good” as opposed to “bad” is higher when another individ - ual believes so as well . For all i , j , and for k 2 { 1 , 2 } , P ( ˆ Q ik ⇤ 1 | ˆ Q j k ⇤ 1 ) P ( ˆ Q ik ⇤ 0 | ˆ Q j k ⇤ 1 ) > P ( ˆ Q ik ⇤ 1 | ˆ Q j k ⇤ 0 ) P ( ˆ Q ik ⇤ 0 | ˆ Q j k ⇤ 0 ) . Figure 5 displays how these odds ratios evolve over time . The di ﬀ erence in odds ratios predicted by the inequality of Corollary 1 emerges rather quickly , after about 50 periods , and it increases over time . After about 50 periods , the odds that an individual i believes that alternative 1 is “good” rather than “bad” when another individual j also believes alternative 1 is “good” are higher than the odds that i believes that alternative 1 is “good” rather than “bad” when j believes alternative 1 is “bad” ( see the left panel ) . The same holds for alternative 2 ( see the right panel ) . In summary , the quality estimates of the individuals in the group become positively dependent on each other after some time .

Denrell and Le Mens : Information Sampling , Belief Synchronization , and Collective Illusions 536 Management Science 63 ( 2 ) , pp . 528 – 547 , © 2017 INFORMS These results about the emergence of a positive de - pendence between estimates are important because they illustrate a possible limitation of the wisdom of crowds ( Galton 1907 , Surowiecki 2004 ) . The wisdom of crowds refers to the observation that the belief of the majority is often correct . The theoretical explanation of this phenomenon relies on the Condorcet ( 1785 ) jury theorem , which assumes that beliefs are formed inde - pendently ( Grofman et al . 1983 ) . It is well known that if individuals base their beliefs on the beliefs of others , i . e . , if social learning operates , then the majority beliefs may not contain much more information than the belief of a single individual ( e . g . , Lorenz et al . 2011 ) . This is because the beliefs of the members of the group are based on redundant information . Our theory implies that even if beliefs are based on independent pieces of evidence , beliefs will still become dependent if sam - pling behavior is a ﬀ ected by popularity . 3 . 3 . Relation to Prior Sampling Models Our formal model is based on but considerably extends prior sampling models . As in prior sampling models ( e . g . , Denrell 2005 ) , we examine how beliefs evolve when prior beliefs inﬂuence sampling . Unlike prior models , we consider a population of individuals , who make their own sampling decisions although inﬂu - enced by majority beliefs . The most closely related prior model is the model of interdependent sampling by Denrell and Le Mens ( 2007 ) . Like the current model , the model of interdependent sampling examines how the attitudes of several individuals evolve over time when they inﬂuence each others’ sampling processes . Unlike the current model , however , the model of inter - dependent sampling assumes that individuals sam - ple simultaneously ( for example , two individuals go together to the same restaurant ) . This assumption can be realistic for dyads , but is unrealistic for large pop - ulations . Our current model examines a population of individuals who sample alternatives at di ﬀ erent times , but whose sampling behavior is inﬂuenced by the opin - ions of others . The models thus di ﬀ er both concep - tually and formally . Moreover , whereas the focus of Denrell and Le Mens ( 2007 ) was on when joint sam - pling could lead to positive or negatively correlated attitudes , this paper focuses on how a majority inﬂu - ence on sampling behavior can lead to the emergence of a collective illusion . 4 . Discussion of the Assumptions of the Model Our basic results also hold when there are more than two alternatives and under di ﬀ erent assump - tions about the payo ﬀ distributions and updating rule . The payo ﬀ distributions could be Normal instead of Bernoulli , and the quality estimates could be weighted averages of all past observations instead of being based only on the most recent observation . In this section , we provide a complete description of this version of our model because it leads to formulas that allow for an easy interpretation of the e ﬀ ects of the various model parameters . We also discuss other inﬂuences on sam - pling and belief updating . 4 . 1 . A Model with Normally Distributed Payo   s and Fractional Updating 4 . 1 . 1 . Model Speciﬁcation . The structure of the model is the same as before , but the assumptions regarding the payo ﬀ distributions and estimate updating rules di ﬀ er . 6 Payo   s of the Alternatives . The payo ﬀ s of alternative k ( k 2 { 1 , 2 } ) are independent draws from a normal distribution with mean µ k and variance   2 ( both alter - natives have the same variance ) . In what follows , µ k refers to the “quality” of alternative k . Quality Estimates . Individual i ’s quality estimate for alternative 1 ( alternative 2 ) at the beginning of period t is random variable ˆ Q i 1 , t ( ˆ Q i 2 , t ) . The initial estimate of individual i for the quality of alternative k is a ran - dom draw from a normal distribution with mean µ k and variance   2 . Let , for all i , ˆ Z it ⇤ ( ˆ Q i 1 , t , ˆ Q i 2 , t ) and ˆ Z t ⇤ ( ˆ Z 1 t , . . . , ˆ Z nt ) . Similarly , for all i , ˆ z it ⇤ ( ˆ q i 1 , t , ˆ q i 2 , t ) and ˆ z t ⇤ ( ˆ z 1 t , . . . , ˆ z nt ) . Sampling Rule . The probability that an individual selects the ﬁrst alternative is given by a logistic choice rule , as in the model of the previous section . The choice likelihood is based on the average quality estimates of the two alternatives , computed across all the people in the population : pC 1 , t ⇤ pC 1 ( ˆ z t ) ⇤ e s ( 1 / n ) P ni ⇤ 1 ˆ q i 1 , t e s ( 1 / n ) P ni ⇤ 1 ˆ q i 1 , t + e s ( 1 / n ) P ni ⇤ 1 ˆ q i 2 , t , ( 3 ) where s is a parameter that regulates the sensitivity of the choice probability to the average quality estimate . We assume s > 0 . This equation implies that the indi - vidual is likely to select the more popular alternative , in the sense that people in the population estimate it more positively . The probability of selecting the sec - ond alternative is deﬁned similarly and is denoted by pC 2 , t ⇤ pC 2 ( ˆ z t ) ⇤ 1   pC 1 , t . Estimate Updating Rule . The revised estimate is a weighted average of the past estimate and the new observation ( Busemeyer and Myung 1992 , Denrell 2005 ) . When individual i selects alternative 1 , her qual - ity estimate is updated as follows : ˆ Q i 1 , t + 1 ⇤ ˆ Q i 1 , t ( 1   b ) + bO i 1 , t , where O i 1 , t is the observation of the payo ﬀ of alternative 1 in period t ( O i 1 , t ⇠ N ( µ 1 ,   2 ) ) and b is such that 0 < b < 1 . When an alternative is not sampled , its quality estimate does not change . The estimate updat - ing rule is the same for alternative 2 .

In this setting , it is possible to derive easily interpretable closed - form expressions for the correlations between the quality estimates of any two individuals . 7 We denote by ˆ Q i 1 ( ˆ Q i 2 ) individ - ual i ’s stationary quality estimate of the ﬁrst ( second ) alternative . Proposition 3 ( Correlation Between Quality Estimates of Two Individuals ) . ( i ) The pairwise correlations between sta - tionary quality estimates for a given alternative are positive . For all i , j , and for k 2 { 1 , 2 } , corr ( ˆ Q ik , ˆ Q j k ) ⇤ 1 1 + ( 2 + e   s ( µ 1   µ 2 ) + e s ( µ 1   µ 2 ) ) n 2 ( 2   b ) / ( s 2   2 b ) > 0 . ( 4 ) ( ii ) The pairwise correlations between stationary quality estimates for competing alternatives are negative . For all i , j , corr ( ˆ Q i 1 , ˆ Q j 2 ) ⇤   corr ( ˆ Q ik , ˆ Q j k ) < 0 . The sizes of the correlation increases with the weight of new observations b , the standard deviation of the payo ﬀ distribution   , and s , the sensitivity of the choice likelihood to quality estimates . When b is close to 1 , the e ﬀ ect is stronger because quality estimates reﬂect few observations ( past observations are heavily dis - counted ) . With n ⇤ 5 , µ 1 ⇤   0 . 25 , µ 2 ⇤ 0 ,   ⇤ 2 , s ⇤ 5 , the correlation goes from 0 with b ⇤ 0 to 0 . 41 with b ⇤ 1 . It is equal to 0 . 15 when b ⇤ 0 . 4 , which is a typical value for b in several experiments on sequential choice under uncertainty ( see Table 1 in Denrell 2005 ) . If   is high , each observation is a “noisy” signal of the quality of the alternative . The correlation goes from 0 with   ⇤ 0 to 1 when   is very large . The correlation is maximal when the two alterna - tives have the same quality ( µ 1 ⇤ µ 2 ) and it decreases with the di ﬀ erence between the qualities of the alter - natives ( | µ 1   µ 2 | ) . This is not surprising , because when the qualities of the alternatives are very di ﬀ erent , each observation is more diagnostic of the ranking of the alternatives . Finally , the correlation decreases with n , the size of the population . The intuition is that when the population is larger , the inﬂuence of each mem - ber on the sampling behavior of the focal individual is diluted . The reason is that the focal individual’s sam - pling likelihood is assumed to increase with the aver - age estimate of all the members in the population . 4 . 2 . The Sampling Rule and the Role of Popularity Our assumption of a logistic sampling rule ( see Equa - tions ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) ) is consistent with much prior research on sequential choice under uncertainty . It has been used in models with a reinforcement learning struc - ture ( e . g . , Denrell and Le Mens 2011 , Erev and Bar - ron 2005 , Sutton and Barto 1998 ) and it ﬁts well data on repeated choices between uncertain alternatives ( e . g . , Busemeyer and Stout 2002 ) . A version of the logis - tic choice rule was also recently proposed by MacCoun ( 2012 ) as a model for the e ﬀ ect of the number of inﬂuence sources on conformity behavior . MacCoun ( 2012 ) shows that the model ﬁts well data from several sources including data from Asch’s ( 1956 ) experiment on line length judgments and the Milgram et al . ( 1969 ) study on the e ﬀ ect of the number of people looking up at a sixth ﬂoor window in a street of New York city . In the logistic choice model , the parameter s reg - ulates how sensitive people are to the opinions of others . A high value of s implies that people are very likely to choose the more popular alternative . As MacCoun ( 2012 ) suggests , this parameter can be inter - preted as an index of norm clarity . The magnitude of our results—the extent to which quality estimates are inﬂuenced by popularity—depends critically on the value of s . The e ﬀ ect is large when s is high and small when s is low . Thus , according to our model , popular - ity cannot inﬂuence quality estimates much if choices are relatively insensitive to popularity . ( Equation ( 4 ) shows that the correlation between estimates increases with s . ) The same holds for many other models of the e ﬀ ect of popularity and conformity on belief formation , such as social impact theory ( Latané 1981 , Latane and Wolf 1981 ) . Our model assumes that all individuals in the pop - ulation , including the focal actor , matter equally . For - mally , sampling only depends on N 1 and N 2 . Hence , an individual is not assumed to weight his or her own opinion more than that of others . This assumption was made for simplicity and mathematical tractabil - ity ( assuming symmetry seems necessary to derive an analytically tractable formula for the joint distribution of the estimates ) . Nevertheless , computer simulations show that our results still hold when this assumption is relaxed . For example , if the weight of the estimate of the self is equal to 2 , whereas the weight of the esti - mates of others is equal to 0 . 5 , the joint distribution of popularities is still bimodal after 100 periods . 8 Our model assumes that people are more likely to choose popular alternatives , but this assumption is not always correct . If an alternative has become popular , individuals may wish to choose a less popular alterna - tive to restore their freedom of choice ( Brehm 1966 ) or to distinguish themselves from others ( Brewer 1991 ) . In particular , Brewer’s ( 1991 ) theory of optimal distinc - tiveness suggests that individuals shy away from alter - natives that are too popular . What are the implication of such alternative assumptions for our results ? On the one hand , if the preference for distinctiveness is strong , our basic result is unlikely to hold . This suggests an important scope condition for our model ( as well as for other models , including herding models , that assume D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 84 . 89 . 157 . 34 ] on 21 M a r c h 2017 , a t 09 : 10 .

Denrell and Le Mens : Information Sampling , Belief Synchronization , and Collective Illusions 538 Management Science 63 ( 2 ) , pp . 528 – 547 , © 2017 INFORMS that people choose popular alternatives ) . On the other hand , our basic result can still hold if people care about distinctiveness in addition to popularity . To verify this , consider the following version of our model with binary payo ﬀ s . Suppose that the attrac - tiveness of alternative 1 increases linearly with the number of others who have a “good” estimate of that alternative until N 1 ⇤   , and then decreases linearly until 0 when N 1 ⇤ n . The same is assumed for alter - native 2 . 9 Simulations of this model ( with the same parameters as for Figure 1 ) show that when   is low ( e . g . ,   ⇤ 2 and n ⇤ 10 ) , people avoid popular alterna - tives , and the distribution of the di ﬀ erence in popu - larity is unimodal with its mode close to 0 ( after 100 periods ) ; that is , when people have a strong preference for distinctiveness (   ⇤ 2 and n ⇤ 10 ) , our main result does not hold . But if the preference for distinctiveness is weaker (   is equal to 4 or higher and n ⇤ 10 ) , the distribution of the di ﬀ erences in popularity is bimodal : our main result holds in this case . 4 . 3 . Belief Updating and Popularity Our model assumes that popularity only inﬂuences sampling and has no direct e ﬀ ect on belief updating . In reality , popularity can impact both sampling and belief updating . Most importantly , people may infer that the popular alternative is better . We examine this possibil - ity in the next section when we compare our model to models in the information cascade tradition ( see Sec - tion 5 . 3 ) . Several other interactions between popularity and belief updating are possible . First , if people feel pressured to select the popular alternative—and expe - rience this as a threat to their freedom—they might dis - count or ignore the information sampled under such pressure ( Brehm 1966 ) . Second , those who consciously select an unpopular alternative—and thus demon - strate agency—may be motivated to assess it positively ( Aronson 2007 ) . Experiences with the unpopular alter - native may for this reason be interpreted di ﬀ erently than experiences with the popular alternative . Finally , conﬁrmation bias and contrast e ﬀ ects imply that prior expectations impact how new experiences are inter - preted . When going to a popular restaurant , people may have positive expectations and pay attention to experiences conﬁrming their expectations ( Nickerson 1998 ) . On the other hand , a negative experience with an alternative for which the decision maker had positive expectations can be particularly striking , and might carry a high weight in the belief updating process . In settings where any of these e ﬀ ects has a large impact on belief updating , our results may not hold . This suggests that our model is most applicable to settings where the inﬂuence of popularity is somewhat subtle , such as when people are nudged to select more popular alter - natives because these are more available . 5 . Relations to Other Explanations 5 . 1 . Coordination Failures Due to Network Externalities Our theory di ﬀ ers from explanations of collective mis - takes that attribute them to a coordination failure due to network externalities ( Arthur 1989 , Elster 1978 , North 1990 , Pierson 2004 ) . These explanations assume that people know that they are selecting a suboptimal alternative , but do not switch because it is di ﬃ cult ( or impossible ) to coordinate the transition to the superior alternative . Our theory suggests that if network exter - nalities lead people to select and thus sample popular alternatives , most people may not only choose the infe - rior alternative , but , when this happens , most people will also come to believe that the inferior alternative is of superior quality . Thus , in a vote about whether to switch to another alternative , most people will favor sticking to the status quo even if it is actually inferior . By contrast , explanations that rely on a coordination failure predict that people will switch if a vote can be organized and switching costs are low . 5 . 2 . Belief Adjustments Our theory also di ﬀ ers from existing mechanisms that explain why people might agree with the beliefs of the majority even when the majority is wrong . Exist - ing explanations for this synchronization of beliefs across members of a social group generally rely on belief adjustments ( Cialdini and Goldstein 2004 , Kunda 1990 , Wood 2000 ) . One class of explanations proposes that people might adopt the behavior of the major - ity and then adjust their ( private ) beliefs and atti - tudes with their own behavior ( Bem 1972 , Festinger 1957 ) . Another class of explanations proposes that peo - ple might adjust their ( private ) beliefs and attitudes to conform with the behavior of the majority because they identify with the majority ( Cialdini and Goldstein 2004 , Festinger et al . 1950 , Hogg and Turner 1987 , Turner 1991 , Wood 2000 ) . Our explanation does not challenge the experimental evidence underlying those explanations . Rather , it suggests a complementary expla - nation that operates at a di ﬀ erent level of analysis : these explanations invoke properties of the mind’s informa - tion processing mechanisms , whereas our explanation focuses on properties of the sample of information on which these mechanisms operate . To analyze the role of information sampling biases , we have assumed that people are good processors of information , but that they are naïve with respect to the nature of the sample they use to form their beliefs . This strategy is central to the research program on sampling explanations of judgment biases in which our theory ﬁts ( Fiedler 2012 , Fiedler and Juslin 2006 , Juslin et al . 2007 ) . Just like other contributors to this research program , we do not claim that people do not engage in such intrapsychic belief adjustments .

Information Cascades How do our results relate to herding models that rely on information cascades , which also explain collective failures to identify the best alternative ( Banerjee 1992 , Bikhchandani et al . 1992 ) ? At an abstract level , our model may seem quite similar to herding models . Like herding models , our model assumes that choices between alternatives are determined by the opinions of others . The crucial di ﬀ erence , however , is that our model leaves out one of the key components of infor - mation cascade models : the assumption that people rely on popularity to make inferences about the quality of alternatives . To clarify the di ﬀ erence between our sampling model and herding and information cascade mod - els , suppose that a majority of individuals come to believe that A is superior to B . Herding models assume that information about such majority opinions directly impacts quality estimates : people infer that A is likely superior to B . Because information about the major - ity opinion inﬂuence quality estimates ( people infer A is superior ) , it also has an indirect e ﬀ ect on choice behavior ( people choose A because they believe it is superior ) . Our model does not assume that informa - tion about the majority opinion directly inﬂuences quality estimates . In our model , the majority opinion inﬂuences behavior ( people likely sample A ) . Qual - ity estimates are only indirectly inﬂuenced by major - ity opinions through their e ﬀ ect on sampling ( because people sample A their negative opinions about A could change ) . Stated di ﬀ erently , in our model , popularity only has an indirect e ﬀ ect on beliefs , an e ﬀ ect that is mediated by the e ﬀ ect on popularity on sampling . Because our model does not assume that information about the majority opinion directly inﬂuences qual - ity estimates , it may be more suitable for settings in which such an assumption is not warranted . First , indi - viduals may have di ﬀ erent tastes or skills and may not believe that others know best ( e . g . , Banerjee et al . 2013 , Hendricks et al . 2012 , Munshi 2004 ) . In situa - tions where tastes and skills di ﬀ er between people , it makes little sense for an individual to make an infer - ence about how good an alternative is for her on the basis of popularity . For example , a vegetarian should probably not pay much attention to the popularity of restaurants among nonvegetarians . Although it does not make sense , in these situations , for the decision maker to infer how good an alternative will be for her on the basis of popularity , our model can still apply . To see how , note that even when tastes or skills dif - fer , people might still have a tendency to select popu - lar alternatives . Vegetarians might be motivated to go to a restaurant liked by nonvegetarians to spend time with friends . In such settings , the payo ﬀ distributions of the alternatives systematically di ﬀ er across people , but they still have a tendency to select popular alterna - tives . To see how we can analyze such situations , con - sider a variant of our model with binary payo ﬀ s , where the only modiﬁcation is that we now suppose that the success probabilities of the alternatives are speciﬁc to each individual . Let p ik be the success probability of alternative k for individual i . The proofs of our main results ( Propositions 1 and 2 ) can be easily adapted to this case ( at the cost of some complications in the nota - tions ) . In other words , our theory predicts that quality estimates will tend to synchronize even when there is taste and skill heterogeneity . This is in contrast to the predictions of information cascade accounts of confor - mity . Since it does not make sense to use popularity to infer quality in these situations , these theories would not predict that beliefs would become synchronized . Second , our theory also ﬁts settings where informa - tion about more popular alternatives is more immedi - ately available and nudges people into selecting them without people forming conscious impressions about the quality of di ﬀ erent alternatives . This frequently happens on online recommendation systems embed - ded in review websites ( e . g . , TripAdvisor , Yelp , Zagat ) or media streaming platforms ( e . g . , Youtube , Spotify ) where items liked by many are often displayed at the top of search results . Readers who browse the Web by clicking on hyperlinks are thus likely to sample again opinions that are already popular in their ( online ) social circles ( Sunstein 2009 ) . Our model suggests that such subtle inﬂuences on sampling behavior have the potential to create a synchronization of opinions , even if people do not make inferences about the worthiness of opinions on the basis of their popularities . In fact , our model does not require that people be aware of the fact that some alternatives are more popular than others . All that matters is that they have an increased propensity to sample again alternatives liked by others . 6 . Application to Social Choice The crucial assumption of our model is that people are more likely to sample popular alternatives than unpopular alternatives . An important reason for why this often happens is social choice , such as majority vot - ing . When groups select alternatives by using majority voting ( Davis 1973 , Hastie and Kameda 2005 , Stasser et al . 1980 ) , every member will be exposed to the more popular alternative , even those who were in favor of another alternative . Our theory predicts that such a social choice rule will contribute to an homogenization of opinions . To see how , consider members of a university depart - ment who vote about new appointments on a periodic D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 84 . 89 . 157 . 34 ] on 21 M a r c h 2017 , a t 09 : 10 . F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y , a ll r i gh t s r e s e r v e d . Denrell and Le Mens : Information Sampling , Belief Synchronization , and Collective Illusions 540 Management Science 63 ( 2 ) , pp . 528 – 547 , © 2017 INFORMS basis . When a new faculty member joins , all the mem - bers of the department get exposed to the research tradition the new member represents . Based on this experience , members can update their attitudes toward this research tradition . Our theory implies that the outcome of this process of learning and voting is an homogenization of attitudes : most people will come to prefer the same research tradition . Although this prediction would not be surprising in settings where all the group members made the same observations , our theory also predicts that voting will lead to an homogenization of attitudes even if the observations of the group members are independent from each others , i . e . , are independent realizations of the underlying ran - dom variable . This implies , in particular , that attitudes will tend to become more homogenous even if group members have di ﬀ erent tastes . To demonstrate this formally , consider a variant of our model with binary payo ﬀ s . All the assumptions remain unchanged except for the sampling rule : we now assume that , in every period , all the individu - als sample the most popular alternative . If N 1 > N 2 ( N 1 < N 2 ) , everybody selects alternative 1 ( alterna - tive 2 ) . If N 1 ⇤ N 2 , one alternative is selected ran - domly and everybody samples it . The observations of all the individuals are independent realizations of the underlying payo ﬀ variable . With these assumptions , the stationary distribution of the popularities is in fact very similar to that of the model with binary payo ﬀ s ( Proposition 1 ) . 10 Thus , quality estimates will become synchronized : most individuals will agree that one alternative is superior to the other one , but the favored alternative does not have to be the superior one . In summary , majority voting combined with indi - vidual learning can lead to an homogenization of opinions , possibly in favor of a less - than - optimal alter - native . Unlike prior literature , our model does not need to assume that group members identify with the group ( e . g . , Mackie 1986 ) . As such , our theory casts new light on the conditions where group membership con - tributes to attitude and opinion homogeneity . 7 . Discussion and Conclusion Our model o ﬀ ers an existence proof that a sampling - based account could explain phenomena usually attributed to either rational popularity - based infer - ences or to irrational cognitive biases . Our approach does not require that people engage in sophisticated inferences based on the choices of others or that peo - ple engage in motivated cognition . Rather , it empha - sizes basic learning processes in an environment where sampling is driven by the opinions of the majority . Sampling inﬂuenced by the majority o ﬀ ers a simple alternative explanation for how public conformity in behavior can lead to private acceptance and a possible collective illusion . How can the sampling - based account proposed in this paper be empirically distinguished from the inference - based mechanism ? To address this question , it is useful to consider a setting where ﬁne - grained data about quality estimates are available and popularity a ﬀ ects both quality inferences and sampling behavior . Suppose that at the beginning of each period , people report their quality estimates for the two alternatives A and B ( ˆ q At and ˆ q Bt ) , then learn about the popularity of the alternatives ( N At and N Bt ) , then report their qual - ity estimates given what they know about the popu - larities ( let us call these ˆ q At ⇤ and ˆ q Bt ⇤ —these quantities are not part of our formal model ) , then sample one of the alternatives , then report their quality estimates again ( ˆ q At + 1 and ˆ q Bt + 1 ) . Consider alternative A . In this context , the e ﬀ ect of popularity - based inferences is the e ﬀ ect of popularity on ˆ q At ⇤   ˆ q At . The e ﬀ ect of popu - larity through sampling is the e ﬀ ect of popularity on ˆ q At + 1   ˆ q At ⇤ . The total e ﬀ ect of popularity on quality esti - mates is the e ﬀ ect of popularity on ˆ q At + 1   ˆ q At . If there are no popularity - based quality inferences , we have ˆ q At ⇤ ⇤ ˆ q At . In this case , the e ﬀ ect of popularity would be entirely driven by its e ﬀ ect on sampling behavior , as in our formal model . In the remainder of this dis - cussion , we refer to this case as the “direct sampling account . ” This example shows that the “direct sampling account” has empirical implications distinct from inference - based accounts . To cleanly distinguish be - tween these accounts , however , researchers need data about quality estimates after people learn about the popularity and before they make their sampling deci - sions ( i . e . , researchers need ˆ q At ⇤ and ˆ q Bt ⇤ ) . In many nat - urally occurring environments , such detailed data on quality estimates are not available . Researchers may have access to data on quality estimates and sampling behavior in each of several periods , but may not know if quality estimates do reﬂect , or not , the informa - tion agents have about the popularities of the alterna - tives . With such data , researchers cannot distinguish between the direct e ﬀ ect of popularity on sampling behavior and its indirect e ﬀ ect via quality estimates ; that is , suppose a researcher ﬁnds that popularity in period t   1 a ﬀ ects sampling behavior in period t . Such an e ﬀ ect may occur because popularity directly inﬂu - ences sampling ( as in the “direct sampling account” ) or because popularity indirectly inﬂuence sampling via popularity - based quality inferences . Our sampling model can be useful even when it is not possible to empirically disentangle the two ways in which popularity has an e ﬀ ect on sampling behav - ior . The sampling model shows that the e ﬀ ect of pop - ularity on sampling behavior—whether mediated by quality estimates or not—must be taken into account to explain the association between popularity and quality D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 84 . 89 . 157 . 34 ] on 21 M a r c h 2017 , a t 09 : 10 .

Researchers who ignore the e ﬀ ect of popu - larity on sampling will overestimate the e ﬀ ect of pop - ularity on quality estimates through popularity - based inferences . In addition to any direct e ﬀ ect of popu - larity on estimates—due to inferences about quality from popularity—our model shows that in settings where people learn about the qualities of the alterna - tives partly from their own experiences , there is also an indirect e ﬀ ect of popularity on beliefs that operates via sampling behavior . This paper has focused on collective illusions , but a sampling account could be applied to other phe - nomena in information economics where prior the - oretical accounts have emphasized inferences from choices . Consider signaling ( Spence 1973 ) . Models of costly signaling assume that audiences make infer - ences about individual traits on the basis of choices of activities . A sampling account suggests that these choices can also impact preferences over activities : peo - ple choosing education sample information about this activity and learn that they enjoy education . More generally , economic incentives that inﬂuence choice will likely have systematic e ﬀ ects on evaluations and beliefs because—as the empirical literature on sam - pling e ﬀ ects shows—sampling biases have systematic e ﬀ ects on belief formation ( Fiedler 2000 , Fazio et al . 2004 , Fetchenhauer and Dunning 2010 ) .

Appendix A . Proofs for the Model with Binary Payo   s A . 1 . Proof of Proposition 1 Note that N 1 and N 2 are the random variables N 1 , t and N 2 , t converge to . The state space is of size ( 2 · 2 ) n . The Markov process , { N 1 , t , N 2 , t , t ⇤ 1 , 2 , . . . } , is irreducible and aperi - odic . Therefore , the joint distribution of ( N 1 , N 2 ) is uniquely deﬁned ( Lemma 5 . 14 in Ross and Pekoz 2007 ) . To demon - strate that a distribution is the asymptotic distribution , it is therefore enough to show that it satisﬁes a stability equation . To formulate the stability equation , we begin by writing the joint distribution of estimates at the beginning of period t as a function of the joint distribution of estimates at the beginning of period t   1 and the transition probabilities . Let f t denote the joint distribution of ( ˆ Q 11 , t , ˆ Q 12 , t , . . . , ˆ Q n 1 , t , ˆ Q n 2 , t ) . We can write 11 f t ( ˆ q 11 , t , ˆ q 12 , t , . . . , ˆ q j 1 , t , ˆ q j 2 , t , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , t , ˆ q n 2 , t ) ⇤ 4 X k ⇤ 1 B k , t , ( A1 ) with B 1 , t ⇤ t   1 X j ⇤ 1 1 n f t   1 ( ˆ q 11 , t   1 , ˆ q 12 , t   1 , . . . , ˆ q j 1 , t   1 , ˆ q j 2 , t   1 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , t   1 , ˆ q n 2 , t   1 ) · pC 1 p ˆ q j 1 , t   1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) 1   ˆ q j 1 , t   1 , ( A2 ) B 2 , t ⇤ n X j ⇤ 1 1 n f t   1 ( ˆ q 11 , t   1 , ˆ q 12 , t   1 , . . . , ˆ q j 1 , t   1 , ˆ q j 2 , t   1 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , t   1 , ˆ q n 2 , t   1 ) · pC 1 p 1   ˆ q j 1 , t   1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) ˆ q j 1 , t   1 , ( A3 ) B 3 , t ⇤ n X j ⇤ 1 1 n f t   1 ( ˆ q 11 , t   1 , ˆ q 12 , t   1 , . . . , ˆ q j 1 , t   1 , ˆ q j 2 , t   1 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , t   1 , ˆ q n 2 , t   1 ) · ( 1   pC 1 ) p ˆ q j 2 , t   1 2 ( 1   p 2 ) 1   ˆ q j 2 , t   1 , ( A4 ) B 4 , t ⇤ n X j ⇤ 1 1 n f t   1 ( ˆ q 11 , t   1 , ˆ q 12 , t   1 , . . . , ˆ q j 1 , t   1 , ˆ q j 2 , t   1 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , t   1 , ˆ q n 2 , t   1 ) · ( 1   pC 1 ) p 1   ˆ q j 2 , t   1 2 ( 1   p 2 ) ˆ q j 2 , t   1 . ( A5 ) To explain this , consider the summand of B 1 . This is the probability that , in period t   1 , individual j gets selected ( 1 / n ) , that the quality estimates equal ˆ q 11 , t   1 , ˆ q 12 , t   1 , . . . , ˆ q j 1 , t   1 , ˆ q j 2 , t   1 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , t   1 , ˆ q n 2 , t   1 ( which occurs with proba - bility f t   1 ( ˆ q 11 , t   1 , ˆ q 12 , t   1 , . . . , ˆ q j 1 , t   1 , ˆ q j 2 , t   1 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , t   1 , ˆ q n 2 , t   1 ) ) , that individual j samples alternative 1 ( occurs with probability pC 1 ) , and that her estimate does not change . When ˆ q j 1 , t   1 ⇤ 1 , her estimate does not change when j gets a success ( this occurs with probability p 1 ) ; when ˆ q j 1 , t   1 ⇤ 0 , her estimate does not change when j gets a failure ( this occurs with probability 1   p 1 ) . In this scenario , no quality estimate changes . We can express B 1 in terms of the quality estimates at the beginning of period t ( instead of t   1 ) as follows : B 1 , t ⇤ t X j ⇤ 1 1 n f t   1 ( ˆ q 11 , t , ˆ q 12 , t , . . . , ˆ q j 1 , t , ˆ q j 2 , t , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , t , ˆ q n 2 , t ) · pC 1 p ˆ q j 1 , t 1 ( 1   p 1 ) 1   ˆ q j 1 , t . The summand of B 2 is the probability that , in the previous period , individual j gets selected , that the quality estimates equal ˆ q 11 , t   1 , ˆ q 12 , t   1 , . . . , ˆ q j 1 , t   1 , ˆ q j 2 , t   1 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , t   1 , ˆ q n 2 , t   1 , that she samples alternative 1 ( this occurs with probability pC 1 ) , and that her estimate changes . When ˆ q 1 , t   1 ⇤ 1 , agent j believes alternative 1 to be “good , ” and thus a change happens when j gets a failure ( this occurs with probability 1   p 1 ) ; when ˆ q 1 , t   1 ⇤ 0 , agent j believe alternative 1 to be “bad , ” and thus a change happens when j gets a success ( this occurs with prob - ability p 1 ) .

We can hence write B 2 in terms of the quality estimates at the beginning of period t as follows : B 2 , t ⇤ n X j ⇤ 1 1 n f t   1 ( ˆ q 11 , t , ˆ q 12 , t , . . . , 1   ˆ q j 1 , t , ˆ q j 2 , t , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , t , ˆ q n 2 , t ) · pC 1 p ˆ q j 1 , t 1 ( 1   p 1 ) 1   ˆ q j 1 , t .

( A8 ) Now that we have described the dynamics of the sys - tem in a convenient form , we can express the stationary joint distribution of estimates of all the individuals in the model . Then we use this distribution to derive the station - ary distribution of the popularities . Let ( ˆ Q 11 , ˆ Q 12 , . . . , ˆ Q n 1 , ˆ Q n 2 ) be the random variables toward which the quality estimates ( ˆ Q 11 , t , ˆ Q 12 , t , . . . , ˆ Q n 1 , t , ˆ Q n 2 , t ) converge . Lemma 1 . The stationary joint density of the estimates of all the individuals ￿ the ˆ q j 1 ’s and ˆ q j 2 ’s can be equal to one or zero ￿ is equal to f ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) ⇤ K ( e   sn 1 + e   sn 2 ) p n 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) n   n 1 p n 2 2 ( 1   p 2 ) n   n 2 , ( A9 ) where n 1 ⇤ P nj ⇤ 1 ˆ q j 1 and n 2 ⇤ P nj ⇤ 1 ˆ q j 2 and K   1 ⇤ ( 1   p 1 + p 1 e   s ) n + ( 1   p 2 + p 2 e   s ) n . Proof . The Markov chain has a unique stationary distribu - tion . To prove that the distribution deﬁned in Equation ( A9 ) is the stationary distribution , it is thus enough to prove that it satisﬁes the following stability equation that is obtained by letting t converge to inﬁnity in Equation ( A1 ) : 12 f ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , . . . , ˆ q j 1 , ˆ q j 2 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) ⇤ 4 X k ⇤ 1 B k , ( A10 ) with B 1 ⇤ n X j ⇤ 1 1 n f ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , . . . , ˆ q j 1 , ˆ q j 2 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) · pC 1 p ˆ q j 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) 1   ˆ q j 1 , ( A11 ) B 2 ⇤ n X j ⇤ 1 1 n f ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , . . . , 1   ˆ q j 1 , ˆ q j 2 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) · pC 1 p ˆ q j 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) 1   ˆ q j 1 , ( A12 ) B 3 ⇤ n X j ⇤ 1 1 n f ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , . . . , ˆ q j 1 , ˆ q j 2 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) · ( 1   pC 1 ) p ˆ q j 2 2 ( 1   p 2 ) 1   ˆ q j 2 , ( A13 ) B 4 ⇤ n X j ⇤ 1 1 n f ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , . . . , ˆ q j 1 , 1   ˆ q j 2 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) · ( 1   pC 1 ) p ˆ q j 2 2 ( 1   p 2 ) 1   ˆ q j 2 . ( A14 ) Now , we verify that the formula for the joint distribution in Equation ( A9 ) satisﬁes the above stability equation . Using the expression for f ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , . . . , ˆ q j 1 , ˆ q j 2 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) given by Equa - tion ( A9 ) , and noting that pC 1 ( n 1 , n 2 ) ⇤ 1 / ( 1 + e   s ( n 1   n 2 ) ) ⇤ e   sn 2 / ( e   sn 2 + e   sn 1 ) , the term which is summed up in B 1 can be expressed as Ke   sn 2 p n 1 + ˆ q j 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) n   n 1 + 1   ˆ q j 1 p n 2 2 ( 1   p 2 ) n   n 2 . Note that when n 1 ⇤ P i , j ˆ q i 1 + ˆ q j 1 , we can write P i , j ˆ q i 1 + 1   ˆ q j 1 ⇤ n 1 + 1   2ˆ q j 1 . Hence , the term that is summed up in B 2 can be expressed as Ke   sn 2 p n 1 + 1   ˆ q j 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) n   n 1 + ˆ q j 1 p n 2 2 ( 1   p 2 ) n   n 2 . Then we have B 1 + B 2 ⇤ K n X j ⇤ 1 1 n e   sn 2 p n 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) n   n 1 p n 2 2 ( 1   p 2 ) n   n 2 · [ p ˆ q j 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) 1   ˆ q j 1 + p 1   ˆ q j 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) ˆ q j 1 ] . However , the term within the bracket always equals 1 , for if ˆ q j 1 ⇤ 1 , then p ˆ q j 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) 1   ˆ q j 1 + p 1   ˆ q j 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) ˆ q j 1 ⇤ p 1 + 1   p 1 ⇤ 1 . ( A15 ) And if ˆ q j 1 ⇤ 0 , then p ˆ q j 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) 1   ˆ q j 1 + p 1   ˆ q j 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) ˆ q j 1 ⇤ 1   p 1 + p 1 ⇤ 1 . ( A16 ) So , B 1 + B 2 ⇤ K n X j ⇤ 1 1 n e   sn 2 p n 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) n   n 1 p n 2 2 ( 1   p 2 ) n   n 2 . ( A17 ) A similar reasoning gives B 3 + B 4 ⇤ K n X j ⇤ 1 1 n e   sn 1 p n 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) n   n 1 p n 2 2 ( 1   p 2 ) n   n 2 . ( A18 ) Finally , 4 X k ⇤ 1 B k ⇤ K n X j ⇤ 1 1 n ( e   sn 1 + e   sn 2 ) p n 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) n   n 1 p n 2 2 ( 1   p 2 ) n   n 2 ⇤ K ( e   sn 1 + e   sn 2 ) p n 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) n   n 1 p n 2 2 ( 1   p 2 ) n   n 2 , ( A19 ) which is the expression for the joint estimate density in Equa - tion ( A9 ) . Also , it is easy to verify that with the proposed formula for K , the expression in Equation ( A9 ) sums to 1 . This concludes the proof . Given the joint distributions of estimates , it is easy to get the joint distribution of the sums , ¯ f ( n 1 , n 2 ) . First , what is the probability of one way of assigning beliefs so that the sums are n 1 and n 2 ? From Equation ( A9 ) we know that it is given by f ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) ⇤ K ( e   sn 1 + e   sn 2 ) p n 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) n   n 1 p n 2 2 ( 1   p 2 ) n   n 2 . ( A20 ) Second , the number of ways there are to have P nj ⇤ 1 ˆ q j 1 ⇤ n 1 and simultaneously P n j ⇤ 1 ˆ q j 2 ⇤ n 2 is   n n 1     n n 2   . By multiplying , we get ¯ f ( n 1 , n 2 ) .

Proof of Proposition 2 ( i ) Suppose , without loss of generality , that k ⇤ 1 , i ⇤ 1 , and j ⇤ 2 . To show that corr ( ˆ Q 11 , ˆ Q 21 ) > 0 , it is enough to show that the joint distribution of estimates , f , is totally positive of order 2 with respect to its ﬁrst and third arguments ( TP 2 , see Karlin and Rinott 1980 , p . 470 – 471 , Eqs . 1 . 7 – 1 . 9 ) . The density f is TP 2 with respect to its ﬁrst and third arguments if and only if , for all ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 1 ⇤ 1 , ˆ q 12 , ˆ q 21 , ˆ q 2 ⇤ 1 , ˆ q 22 , ˆ q 31 , ˆ q 32 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 such that ˆ q 11 < ˆ q 1 ⇤ 1 and ˆ q 21 < ˆ q 2 ⇤ 1 , we have f ( ˆ q 1 ⇤ 1 , ˆ q 12 , ˆ q 2 ⇤ 1 , ˆ q 22 , ˆ q 31 , ˆ q 32 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) · f ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , ˆ q 21 , ˆ q 22 , ˆ q 31 , ˆ q 32 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) > f ( ˆ q 1 ⇤ 1 , ˆ q 12 , ˆ q 21 , ˆ q 22 , ˆ q 31 , ˆ q 32 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) · f ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , ˆ q 2 ⇤ 1 , ˆ q 22 , ˆ q 31 , ˆ q 32 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) . ( A21 ) Let ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 1 ⇤ 1 , ˆ q 21 , ˆ q 2 ⇤ 1 be such that ˆ q 11 < ˆ q 1 ⇤ 1 and ˆ q 12 < ˆ q 1 ⇤ 2 . Given the restrictions on the quality estimates in this model , we have ˆ q 11 ⇤ 0 , ˆ q 1 ⇤ 1 ⇤ 1 , ˆ q 21 ⇤ 0 , and ˆ q 2 ⇤ 1 ⇤ 1 . To simplify the formulas , let denote P n j ⇤ 3 ˆ q j 1 by n 3 ! n 1 . Applied to the asymp - totic joint density , Equation ( A21 ) becomes K ( e   s ( 1 + 1 + n 3 ! n 1 ) + e   sn 2 ) p 1 + 1 + n 3 ! n 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) n   ( 1 + 1 + n 3 ! n 1 ) · p n 2 2 ( 1   p 2 ) n   n 2 K ( e   s ( 0 + 0 + n 3 ! n 1 ) + e   sn 2 ) p 0 + 0 + n 3 ! n 1 1 · ( 1   p 1 ) n   ( 0 + 0 + n 3 ! n 1 ) p n 2 2 ( 1   p 2 ) n   n 2 > K ( e   s ( 1 + 0 + n 3 ! n 1 ) + e   sn 2 ) p 1 + 0 + n 3 ! n 1 1 ( 1   p 1 ) n   ( 1 + 0 + n 3 ! n 1 ) · p n 2 2 ( 1   p 2 ) n   n 2 K ( e   s ( 0 + 1 + n 3 ! n 1 ) + e   sn 2 ) p 0 + 1 + n 3 ! n 1 1 · ( 1   p 1 ) n   ( 0 + 1 + n 3 ! n 1 ) p n 2 2 ( 1   p 2 ) n   n 2 . Simple algebraic manipulations show that this inequality is equivalent to ( e   s ( 2 + n 3 ! n 1 ) + e   sn 2 ) ( e   sn 3 ! n 1 + e   sn 2 ) > ( e   s ( 1 + n 3 ! n 1 ) + e   sn 2 ) ( e   s ( 1 + n 3 ! n 1 ) + e   sn 2 ) . ( A22 ) Further manipulations show that this inequality holds true i ﬀ e   2 s + 1   2 e   s > 0 . ( A23 ) The left - hand side ( LHS ) of this equation can be rewrit - ten as ( 1   e   s ) 2 . This quantity is positive because s > 0 . This implies that the inequality in Equation ( A22 ) is true . In con - clusion , f is TP 2 with respect to its ﬁrst and third arguments . This implies that corr ( ˆ Q 11 , ˆ Q 21 ) > 0 . ( ii ) This proposition follows by a reasoning similar to that used for the proof of ( i ) . A . 3 . Proof of Corollary 1 Without loss of generality , consider k ⇤ 1 , i ⇤ 1 , and j ⇤ 2 . Because the density , f , has a multiplicative form , Equa - tion ( A21 ) implies P ( ˆ Q 11 ⇤ 1 , ˆ Q 21 ⇤ 1 ) P ( ˆ Q 11 ⇤ 0 , ˆ Q 21 ⇤ 1 ) > P ( ˆ Q 11 ⇤ 1 , ˆ Q 21 ⇤ 0 ) P ( ˆ Q 11 ⇤ 0 , ˆ Q 21 ⇤ 0 ) . ( A24 ) By dividing the numerator and denominator of the LHS by P ( ˆ Q 21 ⇤ 1 ) , we obtain the LHS of the inequality of the statement of the corollary . By dividing the numerator and denominator of the right - hand side ( RHS ) , by P ( ˆ Q 2 1 ⇤ 0 ) , we obtain the RHS of the statement of the corollary . Appendix B . Proofs for the Model with Normally Distributed Payo   s We will use the following notation : ˆ Q 1 ⇤ ( ˆ Q 11 , . . . , ˆ Q n 1 ) , ˆ Q 2 ⇤ ( ˆ Q 12 , . . . , ˆ Q n 2 ) , ˆ Z i ⇤ ( ˆ Q i 1 , ˆ Q i 2 ) and ˆ Z ⇤ ( ˆ Z 1 , . . . , ˆ Z n ) ( ˆ Z is the ran - dom variable ˆ Z t converges to ) . We ﬁrst compute the joint dis - tribution of estimates . It is formalized in the following lemma : Lemma 2 . The joint stationary distribution of the quality esti - mates of all individuals in the population for the two alternatives is h ( ˆ z ) ⇤ K ( e   s ( 1 / n ) P ni ⇤ 1 ˆ q i 1 + e   s 1 n P ni ⇤ 1 ˆ q i 2 ) n Y i ⇤ 1 g 1 ( ˆ q i 1 ) g 2 ( ˆ q i 2 ) , ( B1 ) where K   1 ⇤ e ( s 2   2 b ) / ( 2 n ( 2   b ) ) ( e   s µ 1 + e   s µ 2 ) ( B2 ) is a normalizing constant , and g j ( · ) is the density of the esti - mate that an individual would converge to if she always sampled alternative j . In this model , the “popularity” of an alternative is the sum of the quality estimates of that alternative in the population . Let ¯ Q 1 ⇤ P i ˆ Q i 1 and ¯ Q 2 ⇤ P i ˆ Q i 2 , and let ¯ h ( · , · ) denote the joint distribution of ¯ Q 1 and ¯ Q 2 . The joint distribution of the popu - larities is given by the following lemma : Lemma 3 ( Joint Stationary Distribution of Sums of Estimates ) . The stationary distribution of the sums of quality estimates , ¯ Q 1 and ¯ Q 2 is ¯ h ( ¯ q 1 , ¯ q 2 ) ⇤ K ( e   s ( ¯ q 1 / n ) + e   s ( ¯ q 2 / n ) ) ¯ h 1 ( ¯ q 1 ) ¯ h 2 ( ¯ q 2 ) , ( B3 ) where , for j 2 { 1 , 2 } , ¯ h j ( · ) is the density of a normal distribution with mean n µ j and variance n   2 b / ( 2   b ) , and K is a normalizing constant . The joint distribution is a weighted bivariate Normal dis - tribution where the weight is K ( e   s ( ¯ q 1 / n ) + e   s ( ¯ q 2 / n ) ) . As in the above model , the weighting function puts additional weight on the extremes where the alternatives are unpopular . And thus the joint distribution of popularities is bimodal if s is high enough . This implies that a collective illusion might emerge in which the suboptimal alternative is evaluated more positively than the superior alternative . B . 1 . Proof of Lemma 2 We ﬁrst need to show that the stationary distribution of esti - mates exists . Because the model deﬁnes a Markov process in general state space ( noncountable ) , this is a rather involved proof . Fortunately , we can use some recent developments on the analysis of the stability of Harris chains to get to our objective . B . 1 . 1 . Convergence of the Markov Process . With the above speciﬁcation , the ( random ) vector of estimates , ˆ Z t , deﬁnes a Harris chain that is positive recurrent . This implies that ˆ Z t has a unique stationary distribution h ( e . g . , Meyn and Tweedie 1993 ) . To prove this and the convergence , we use the following theorem ( Glynn 2011 ) . Theorem 1 . Consider a Markov chain R ⇤ ( R t : t   1 ) with state space S . We denote by E r ( · ) conditional expectations given that R 1 ⇤ r , and by P r ( · ) conditional probabilities given that R 1 ⇤ r .

( B4 ) Noting that for all i , E | o i 1 , 1   µ 1 | ⇤ 0 and E | o i 2 , 1   µ 2 | ⇤ 0 , we have E ˆ z 1 g ( ˆ Z 2 ) ⇤ n X i ⇤ 1 1 n X j | ˆ q j 1 , 1   µ 1 | + X j | ˆ q j 2 , 1   µ 2 | + pC 1 ( ˆ z 1 ) (   b ) | ˆ q i 1 , 1   µ 1 | + pC 2 ( ˆ z 1 ) (   b ) | ˆ q i 2 , 1   µ 2 |   , ( B5 ) E ˆ z 1 g ( ˆ Z 2 ) ⇤ n X i ⇤ 1 [ | ˆ q i 1 , 1   µ 1 | + | ˆ q i 2 , 1   µ 2 | ]   b n n X i ⇤ 1 [ pC 1 ( ˆ z 1 ) | ˆ q i 1 , 1   µ 1 | + pC 2 ( ˆ z 1 ) | ˆ q i 2 , 1   µ 2 | ] , ( B6 ) E ˆ z 1 g ( ˆ Z 2 ) ⇤ g ( ˆ z 1 )   b n n X i ⇤ 1 [ pC 1 ( ˆ z 1 ) | ˆ q i 1 , 1   µ 1 | + pC 2 ( ˆ z 1 ) | ˆ q i 2 , 1   µ 2 | ] . ( B7 ) The fact that ˆ z 1 2 A c and the deﬁnition of A imply that , for all i , | ˆ q i 1 , 1   µ 1 | > 1 and | ˆ q i 2 , 1   µ 2 | > 1 . Therefore , n X i ⇤ 1 [ pC 1 ( ˆ z 1 ) | ˆ q i 1 , 1   µ 1 | + pC 2 ( ˆ z 1 ) | ˆ q i 2 , 1   µ 2 | ] > n X i ⇤ 1 [ pC 1 ( ˆ z 1 ) + pC 2 ( ˆ z 1 ) ] ⇤ n . ( B8 ) Finally , E ˆ z 1 g ( ˆ Z 2 ) < g ( ˆ z 1 )   b . Setting ✏ ⇤ b > 0 ensures that condition i is satisﬁed . ( ii ) Let ˆ z 1 2 A .

In 2 n transitions , the process can reach any point in the state space ✓ 2 n from any starting point . This is the result of a combination of two facts : First , there is a pos - itive probability that all individuals will have been selected and will have each chosen once the ﬁrst alternative and the second alternative , and thus there is a positive probability that all estimates will have been updated . Second , because updated estimates are weighted averages of previous esti - mates and normally distributed observations , the support of the joint distribution of updated estimates is the whole state space ✓ 2 n . This implies that if we write P ˆ z 1 ( ˆ Z 2 n + 1 2 B ) ⇤ π B p 2 n ( ˆ z 1 , r ) d r , ( B10 ) then the transition density p 2 n ( · , r ) is positive . It is also con - tinuous , as a weighted sum of normal densities . We can then deﬁne   ( r ) ⇤ inf ˆ z 1 2 A p 2 n ( ˆ z 1 , r ) .

In conclusion , the above theorem implies that there exists a unique stationary joint distribution for the estimates . B . 1 . 2 . The Stationary Distribution of the Quality Estimates . We begin by introducing some notations . Let k 2 { 1 , 2 } . Let f k ( · ) denote the density of the payo ﬀ distribution of alterna - tive k . By construction , it is a normal density with mean µ k and standard deviation   . We denote by p k ( r , x ) the proba - bility density of the event that the estimate of individual i transitions from r in period t to x in period t + 1 given that individual i samples alternative k in period t . Under the above assumptions , p k ( r , x ) equals ( 1 / b ) f j ( ( 1 / b ) ( x   ( 1   b ) r ) ) . Let g k ( · ) be a normal density with mean µ k and variance   2 b / ( 2   b ) . It is easy to verify that g k is stable by application of the transition kernel p k ( · , · ) : π r g k ( r ) p k ( r , x ) dr ⇤ g k ( x ) . ( B11 ) We can now formulate the stability equation for the joint probability of estimates : h ( ˆ z ) ⇤ n X i ⇤ 1 1 n π r i h ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , . . . , r i , ˆ q i 2 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) · pC 1 ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , . . . , r i , ˆ q i 2 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) p 1 ( r i , ˆ q i 1 ) dr i + n X i ⇤ 1 1 n π r i h ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , . . . , ˆ q i 1 , r i , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) · pC 2 ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , . . . , ˆ q i 1 , r i , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) p 2 ( r i , ˆ q i 2 ) dr i . ( B12 ) To explain this , consider the ﬁrst term in the ﬁrst sum : 1 n π r i h ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , . . . , r i , ˆ q i 2 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) · pC 1 ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , . . . , r i , ˆ q i 2 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) p 1 ( r i , ˆ q i 1 ) dr i . This is the probability that individual i gets selected , that all other individuals have estimates ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 , that indi - vidual i has estimates equal to r i and ˆ q i 2 , that she samples D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 84 . 89 . 157 . 34 ] on 21 M a r c h 2017 , a t 09 : 10 .

We integrate over all possible estimates about the ﬁrst alternative . The other terms have a similar explanation . To show that the above joint density ( Equation ( B1 ) ) does satisfy the stability equa - tion ( Equation ( B12 ) ) , note ﬁrst that pC 1 ( z ) can be written as follows : pC 1 ( ˆ z ) ⇤ e   s ( 1 / n ) P nj ⇤ 1 ˆ q j 2 e   s ( 1 / n ) P nj ⇤ 1 ˆ q j 1 + e   s ( 1 / n ) P nj ⇤ 1 ˆ q j 2 . ( B13 ) We insert this expression and the stationary joint density into the ﬁrst term of the ﬁrst sum : 1 n π r i h ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , . . . , r i , ˆ q i 2 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) · pC 1 ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , . . . , r i , ˆ q i 2 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) p 1 ( r i , ˆ q i 1 ) dr i ⇤ K 1 n e   s ( 1 / n ) P j ˆ q j 2 Y j , i g 1 ( ˆ q j 1 ) Y j g 2 ( ˆ q j 2 ) π r i g 1 ( r i ) p 1 ( r i , ˆ q i 1 ) dr i ⇤ K 1 n e   s ( 1 / n ) P j ˆ q j 2 Y j g 1 ( ˆ q j 1 ) Y j g 2 ( ˆ q j 2 ) . ( B14 ) The last equality is a consequence of the fact that Ø r i g 1 ( r i ) p 1 ( r i , ˆ q i 1 ) dr i ⇤ g 1 ( ˆ q i 1 ) . Similarly , the ﬁrst term in the second sum is equal to K 1 n e   s ( 1 / n ) P j ˆ q j 1 Y j g 1 ( ˆ q j 1 ) Y j g 2 ( ˆ q j 2 ) . ( B15 ) Summing across all terms , the right - hand side of Equa - tion ( B12 ) becomes equal to K ( e   s ( 1 / n ) P j ˆ q j 1 + e   s ( 1 / n ) P j ˆ q j 2 ) Y j g 1 ( ˆ q j 1 ) g 2 ( ˆ q j 2 ) , ( B16 ) which is h ( ˆ q 11 , ˆ q 12 , . . . , ˆ q n 1 , ˆ q n 2 ) , the stationary joint density . Noting that the integral of the density should be equal to 1 , we obtain the formula for K . We use it to write an explicit formula for h : h ( ˆ z ) ⇤ ✓ 1 p 2 ⇡ ( b / ( 2   b ) )   2 ◆ 2 n e   s ( 1 / n ) P ni ⇤ 1 ˆ q i 1 + e   s ( 1 / n ) P ni ⇤ 1 ˆ q i 2 e s 2   2 b / ( 2 n ( 2   b ) ) ( e   s µ 1 + e   s µ 2 ) · e   P i ( ( ˆ q i 1   µ 1 ) 2 + ( ˆ q i 2   µ 2 ) 2 ) / ( 2 ( b / ( 2   b ) )   2 ) . ( B17 ) B . 2 . Proof of Lemma 3 : Joint Distribution of the Sum of Estimates To get the joint distribution of the sum , we need to perform a complicated integration of the joint density ( Equation ( B1 ) ) over the region in which the sums equal some constants such as P n i ⇤ 1 ˆ Q i 1 ⇤ ¯ q 1 and P n i ⇤ 1 ˆ Q i 2 ⇤ ¯ q 2 . However , note that if the sums equal ¯ q 1 and ¯ q 2 , the ﬁrst part in the density always equals ( e   s ( ¯ q 1 / n ) + e   s ( ¯ q 2 / n ) ) . Thus , we can ignore the ﬁrst part . The second part is then simple—what remains is a sum of independent normal distributions ! The distribution of the sum of the estimates is thus a normal distribution with mean equal to the sum of the means and variance equal to the sum of the variances . B . 3 . Proof of Proposition 3 ( i ) The formula follows by calculating E ( ˆ Q ik ) , E ( ( ˆ Q ik ) 2 ) , and E ( ˆ Q ik ˆ Q j k ) by doing the appropriate integrations on the basis of Equation ( B1 ) . The calculations are tedious but straightfor - ward ; we therefore provide only the key steps . We have E ( ˆ Q ik ) ⇤ µ k   s   2 b n ( 2   b ) e   s µ k e   s µ 1 + e   s µ 2 , E ( ˆ Q ik ˆ Q j k ) ⇤ ( µ k ) 2   s   2 b n ( 2   b ) e   s µ k e   s µ 1 + e   s µ 2 ✓ 2 µ k   s   2 b n ( 2   b ) ◆ , E ( ( ˆ Q ik ) 2 ) ⇤ ( µ k ) 2 +   2 b 2   b + e   s µ k e   s µ 1 + e   s µ 2 · ✓✓ s   2 b n ( 2   b ) ◆ 2   2 s   2 b n ( 2   b ) µ k ◆ . The proof follows by noting that cov ( ˆ Q ik , ˆ Q j k ) ⇤ E ( ˆ Q ik ˆ Q j k )   E ( ˆ Q ik ) E ( ˆ Q j k ) , var ( ˆ Q ik ) ⇤ E ( ( ˆ Q ik ) 2 )   ( E ( ˆ Q ik ) ) 2 , and corr ( ˆ Q ik , ˆ Q j k ) ⇤ cov ( ˆ Q ik , ˆ Q j k ) / p var ( ˆ Q ik ) var ( ˆ Q j k ) and performing the appropri - ate substitutions and simpliﬁcations . ( ii ) We have E ( ˆ Q i 1 ˆ Q j 2 ) ⇤ µ 1 µ 2   s   2 b n ( 2   b ) µ 2 e   s µ 1 + µ 1 e   s µ 2 e   s µ 1 + e   s µ 2 . The proof follows from computations similar to those in the proof of ( i ) . Endnotes 1 Unless noted otherwise , capital letters refer to random variables . Corresponding lowercase letters denote speciﬁc instances of the ran - dom variables . We use lowercase letters to refer to nonrandom model parameters . 2 See Section 4 . 2 for further discussion of the logistic choice rule . 3 With the parameters used for constructing the graphs of Figure 1 , the ﬁrst mode is located at ( 4 , 1 ) , and the second mode is located at ( 0 , 4 ) . 4 Formally , supposethatweareatthebeginningofperiod t 0 . Suppose that t 0 is large such that we can assume that N 1 , t 0 and N 2 , t 0 follow the asymptotic joint distribution of popularities given by Equation ( 2 ) . Let T denote the ﬁrst time , after t 0 , at which the system enters a state such that N 1 , t > N 2 , t . Using numerical computations on the basis of the transition matrix of the Markov chain deﬁned by our model , we computed the expected “hitting” time of the region of the state space where N 1 > N 2 . This is E [ T   t 0 | N 1 , t 0 < N 2 , t 0 ] . In our numerical computations , we use t 0 ⇤ 10 6 . 5 These results are consistent with prior work on the emergence of correlated estimates and attitudes in a dyad as a result of interde - pendent sampling ( Denrell and Le Mens 2007 ) . In fact , Proposition 2 extends Theorem 1 in Denrell and Le Mens ( 2007 ) and shows that similar results apply to settings where there are more than two individuals and one alternative and where people do not sample simultaneously . 6 For ease of exposition , our model includes just two alternatives . But our results are easily adapted to the case where there are M > 2 alternatives . 7 In this case , the joint distribution of the popularities has a form very similar to the joint distribution of popularities in the model analyzed above . See Lemma 3 in Appendix B for details . 8 This applies for the model with binary payo ﬀ s , with n ⇤ 10 , p 1 ⇤ 0 . 4 , p 2 ⇤ 0 . 45 and s ⇤ 2 . 9 Formally , we assume pC 1 ( n 1 , t , n 2 , t ) ⇤ ↵   ( n 1 , t ) / ( ↵   ( n 1 , t ) + ↵   ( n 2 , t ) ) with ↵   ( m ) ⇤ e s ( mI m    +   ( ( n   m ) / ( N     ) ) I m >   ) andthat I m    isanindicatorvari - able equal to 1 when m    ; otherwise equal to 0 .

The joint stationary distribution of the sum is similar to Equa - tion ( A9 ) , by taking s ⇤ 1 : ¯ f ( n 1 , n 2 ) ⇤ K ( I n 1 ⇤ 0 + I n 2 ⇤ 0 ) ( p 1 ) n 1 ( 1   p 1 ) n   n 1 · ( p 2 ) n 2 ( 1   p 2 ) n   n 2 ✓ nn 1 ◆ ✓ nn 2 ◆ , where I n j ⇤ 0 is an indicator function equal to 1 when n j ⇤ 0 and equal to 0 otherwise . 11 This is assuming that 0 < n 1 , t , n 2 , t < n . What follows can easily be adapted to the cases where n 1 , t or n 2 , t is equal to 0 or n . 12 This is assuming that 0 < n 1 , n 2 < n .
