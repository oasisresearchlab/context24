Raikhel , Center for Plant Cell Biology , Riverside , CA , and approved July 29 , 2016 ( received for review April 15 , 2016 ) Sensing of potential pathogenic bacteria is of critical importance for immunity . In plants , this involves plasma membrane - resident pattern recognition receptors , one of which is the FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 ( FLS2 ) receptor kinase . Ligand - activated FLS2 receptors are internal - ized into endosomes . However , the extent to which these spatio - temporal dynamics are generally present among pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) and their regulation remain elusive . Using live - cell imaging , we show that at least three other receptor kinases associ - ated with plant immunity , PEP RECEPTOR 1 / 2 ( PEPR1 / 2 ) and EF - TU RECEPTOR ( EFR ) , internalize in a ligand - specific manner . In all cases , endocytosis requires the coreceptor BRI1 - ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 ( BAK1 ) , and thus depends on receptor activation status . We also show the internalization of liganded FLS2 , suggesting the transport of signaling competent receptors . Trafficking of activated PRRs re - quires clathrin and converges onto the same endosomal vesicles that are also shared with the hormone receptor BRASSINOSTERIOD INSENSITIVE 1 ( BRI1 ) . Importantly , clathrin - dependent endocytosis participates in plant defense against bacterial infection involving FLS2 - mediated stomatal closure and callose deposition , but is un - coupled from activation of the flagellin - induced oxidative burst and MAP kinase signaling . In conclusion , immunity mediated by pat - tern recognition receptors depends on clathrin , a critical component for the endocytosis of signaling competent receptors into a common endosomal pathway . pattern - triggered immunity | clathrin | FLS2 | PEPR1 | EFR T he plasma membrane forms the primary interface of eukaryotic cells to sense potentially invading pathogens . The recognition of microbe - associated molecular patterns ( MAMPs ) at the plasma membrane is mediated by pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) , critical components of the plant ’ s innate immune system . A wide range of distinct PRRs for conserved microbial patterns have been characterized , including more than 10 PRRs with known ligands in Arabidopsis thaliana ( 1 , 2 ) . A well - studied PRR is FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 ( FLS2 ) , a receptor kinase recognizing a conserved peptide domain of the bacterial flagellin ( flg22 ) and conferring anti - bacterial immunity ( 2 ) . Upon flg22 binding , FLS2 forms a signaling competent complex with the receptor kinase BRI1 - ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 / SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE 3 ( BAK1 / SERK3 ) ( 3 , 4 ) . This activation initiates down - stream immune responses and the internalization of FLS2 from the plasma membrane into endosomes ( 5 ) . BAK1 is a coreceptor shared with many plasma membrane - located receptors . In addition to FLS2 , these include the PRR kinases EF - TU RECEPTOR ( EFR ) recognizing bacterial EF - TU through its elicitor - active epitope elf18 ( 1 ) , receptors for damage - associated endogenous peptides such as PEP RECEPTOR 1 ( PEPR1 ) and PEPR2 that perceive peptides of the AtPep family ( 6 ) , and the brassinosteroid ( BL ) hormone receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 ( BRI1 ) ( 7 ) . Therefore , it is important to establish whether these distinct BAK1 - dependent receptors are internalized from the plasma membrane through similar endocytic routes , and also how endocytosis relates to immunity . In contrast to the constitutive endocytosis of BRI1 ( 7 – 9 ) , FLS2 internalization is triggered upon flg22 perception ( 5 ) . This induces trafficking of FLS2 into the late endosomal pathway and is associ - ated with receptor degradation ( 10 , 11 ) . Induced trafficking into late endosomes was also observed for the receptor - like proteins Cf - 4 and LeEix2 , which recognize fungal Avr4 and xylanase , respectively ( 12 , 13 ) . While this depended on BAK1 / SERK3 for Avr4 - induced Cf - 4 internalization ( 12 ) , BAK1 was not required for xylanase - triggered endocytosis of LeEix2 ( 13 ) . Thus , although internalization of PRRs ( FLS2 , LeEix2 , and Cf - 4 ) is found in plants , whether receptor - mediated endocytosis is a more general feature of activated PRRs and involves shared trafficking routes remains unclear . Here we used live cell confocal imaging aided by quantitative computational image analysis to demonstrate that all tested PRRs undertake receptor - mediated endocytosis following ligand Significance Plants detect conserved molecular patterns of pathogens via cell surface - localized receptors , such as the flagellin receptor kinase FLS2 , that initiate effective plant immunity . Activated FLS2 is endocytosed , but the degree to which other receptor kinases exhibit similar spatiotemporal dynamics remains unclear . We show that internalization into a common endosomal pathway after ligand perception is a general phenomenon of the tested receptor kinases , including the danger peptide receptor PEPR1 . FLS2 endocytosis is mediated by clathrin and is uncoupled from the regulation of acute pathogen - induced responses , but is in - volved in steady defenses and contributes to plant immunity against bacterial infection . We propose that clathrin - dependent internalization of ligand - activated receptor kinases into a common endosomal pathway facilitates the responses required for full plant immunity .

Results and Discussion Ligand - Induced Internalization Is Conserved Across PRR Families . In this study , we addressed whether ligand - induced endocytosis is more widely present among the receptors of the immune system , and focused on PEPR1 / 2 and EFR , PRRs of the receptor kinase family with high ligand binding affinities and specificity for a single ligand . To establish whether PEPR1 and PEPR2 receptor kinases are internalized upon stimulation with pep1 , we investigated stable Arabidopsis lines that express the C - terminally YFP - tagged recep - tors . Ligand - induced internalization of PEPR1 - YFP and PEPR2 - YFP was detected in Arabidopsis leaves ( Fig . 1 A ) , and a time course analysis revealed kinetics of PEPR1 - YFP internalization compa - rable to those of FLS2 - GFP endocytosis ( Fig . 1 B ) ( 5 ) . Importantly , we observed ligand - induced internalization of PEPR1 and FLS2 after heterologous expression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves ( Fig . 1 C ) , a suitable model plant for studying MAMP - triggered immune responses ( 14 ) . In both Arabidopsis and N . benthamiana , PEPR1 - YFP fusion proteins were present at the plasma membrane and relocalized into vesicles upon pep1 elicitation ( Fig . 1 A and C ) . As reported previously ( 15 ) , N . benthamiana - expressed FLS2 - GFP localized to the plasma membrane and was internalized when triggered with flg22 or wild type ( WT ) Pseudomonas syringae pv . tomato DC3000 ( Pto DC3000 ) extracts ( Fig . 1 C and D ) . Flg22 - induced internalization was also observed for homologous expres - sion of Nb FLS2 ( Fig . S1 ) . Taken together , these findings suggest conservation of PRR trafficking between species . The study of N . benthamiana also allows us to visualize EFR - GFP , which cannot be detected in microscopy images of EFR - GFP transgenic Arabidopsis plants despite functional complementation ( 16 ) . We observed plasma membrane localization of EFR - GFP after heterologous expression in N . benthamiana leaves , and EFR - GFP relocalized into vesicles upon elf18 elicitation ( Fig . 1 C ) . In each instance , ligand treatment not matching the cognate PRR , or the use of a Pto DC3000 extract devoid of flagellin , did not result in receptor relocalization from the plasma membrane ( Fig . 1 C and D ) . Thus , ligand - specific internalization is present among several PRRs with similar dynamics to FLS2 . Signaling - Competent PRRs Are Internalized . We next addressed whether ligand - induced endocytosis of PRRs in N . benthamiana also depends on the receptor activation status and function of the coreceptor BAK1 / SERK3 as found for FLS2 in Arabidopsis ( 5 ) . Using virus - induced gene silencing , we knocked down NbSERK3a / b , two closely homologous genes to Arabidopsis BAK1 ( 17 ) , and analyzed the subcellular localization of transiently expressed PEPR1 , FLS2 , and EFR fusion proteins . In contrast to controls , NbSERK3a / b - silenced leaves were inhibited for induced internal - ization of PEPR1 , FLS2 , and EFR ( Fig . S2 A ) . Thus , and despite N . benthamiana lacking PEPR1 or EFR homologs , ligand - induced endocytosis of these transiently expressed receptors was depen - dent on the same coreceptor , indicating strong similarities with the FLS2 and Cf - 4 trafficking pathways . Flg22 induces and stabilizes FLS2 - BAK1 complexes to promote receptor signaling ( 3 , 4 ) . Thus , receptor - mediated endocytosis could result in the concomitant uptake of the ligand with the re - ceptor , raising the possibility that signaling - competent receptors are transported . To investigate this possibility , we treated Arabidopsis cotyledons with TAMRA - flg22 , an N - terminally labeled fluorescent flg22 ( 18 ) . TAMRA - flg22 is comparably biologically active to flg22 A B C D Fig . 1 . Ligand - induced endocytosis is conserved across PRRs .

In epidermal leaf cells of the FLS2 - GFP complemented fls2 null mutant , TAMRA - flg22 was observed in mobile vesicles , and FLS2 - GFP colocalized with these vesicles ( Fig . 2 ) . No vesicles were observed in TAMRA - flg22 – treated fls2 and bak1 - 3 mutant plants ( Fig . 2 and Fig . S2 C ) , in agreement with FLS2 - GFP internalization requiring BAK1 function ( 5 ) . Taken together , these findings dem - onstrate the receptor - dependent uptake of the peptide into FLS2 - GFP – positive endosomes that might explain the irreversible flg22 binding when using intact cells , but not when using plant extracts ( 19 ) . This finding is an example of receptor - mediated cointernalization of ligands in plants , reminiscent of a brassinosteroid fluorescent analog colocalizing with BRI1 ( 9 ) , and demonstrates the inter - nalization of liganded , signaling - competent FLS2 receptors . Liganded FLS2 is destined to the vacuole , as evidenced by TAMRA - flg22 accumulation ( Fig . S2 D ) . The heterodimerization of FLS2 with BAK1 is driven by their extracellular domains and is independent of their kinase activities ( 3 , 20 ) . To test whether FLS2 internalization after flg22 percep - tion requires its kinase activity , we monitored the subcellular be - havior of the kinase - inactive variant FLS2 D997N ( 20 ) . Expression of FLS2 D997N - GFP was detected only at the plasma membrane irrespective of flg22 treatment ( Fig . S2 E ) . Taken together , these results indicate that endocytosis of FLS2 requires reconstitution of an active signaling receptor complex that goes beyond recruitment of SERK3s . Activated PRRs Share a Similar Trafficking Pathway . The observation that activated PRRs are internalized in a ligand - specific manner prompted us to investigate whether the different receptors would be present at distinct endosomal vesicles . To do so , we treated cotyle - dons of PEPR1 - YFP Arabidopsis lines with pep1 in combination with TAMRA or TAMRA - flg22 . PEPR1 - YFP was observed in vesicles , and TAMRA - flg22 , but not TAMRA alone , colocalized to these vesicles ( Fig . 3 A ) . To corroborate and extend these findings , we performed colocalization studies after pairwise heterologous ex - pression of PEPR1 , FLS2 , and EFR in N . benthamiana leaves . Coexpression of differentially labeled FLS2 - GFP and FLS2 - mCherry showed a strong colocalization at endosomes when elicited with flg22 ( Fig . S3 A ) . We then coexpressed PEPR1 - YFP or EFR - GFP with FLS2 - mCherry . Flg22 treatment specifically induced endocytosis of FLS2 - mCherry , but not of PEPR1 - YFP ( Fig . 3 B ) , further illustrating that the endocytosis of these receptors is highly ligand - specific . Pep1 and flg22 coelicitation induced endocytosis of PEPR1 - YFP and FLS2 - mCherry , which exhibited colocalization at endosomes ( Fig . 3 B ) . Likewise , elicitation with elf18 specifically triggered EFR - GFP endocytosis , whereas FLS2 - mCherry maintained its plasma mem - brane localization ( Fig . 3 C ) . Cotreatments with elf18 and flg22 in - duced endocytosis of both EFR - GFP and FLS2 - mCherry , and they colocalized at endosomes ( Fig . 3 C ) . PEPR1 - YFP and EFR - GFP colocalized at FLS2 - mCherry endosomes with a similar Pearson ’ s correlation coefficient value as for the FLS2 - GFP / FLS2 - mCherry pair ( Fig . 3 D ) . These observations suggest that activated PRRs share trafficking into a common endosomal pathway . To support our findings , we tested whether PEPR1 and EFR traffic along the same endocytic pathway as revealed for FLS2 ( 5 , 15 ) , and pairwise coexpressed in N . benthamiana leaves PEPR1 - YFP , FLS2 - GFP , and EFR - GFP with markers of the Golgi appa - ratus ( MEMB12 ) , the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ; Vha - A1 ) , and two partially overlapping populations of endosomes ( ARA7 / RabF2b and ARA6 / RabF1 ) . Upon cognate ligand elicitation , ves - icles positive for each receptor showed colocalization with mCherry - ARA7 / RabF2b – labeled and ARA6 / RabF1 - RFP – labeled endosomes , whereas no colocalization was observed with MEMB12 - mCherry or Vha - A1 - RFP ( Fig . S4 A ) . This was further supported by the Pearson ’ s correlation coefficient values calculated at endosomes ( Fig . S4 B ) . There was no evidence of involvement of the autophagy machinery in FLS2 endocytosis ( Fig . S5 A – C ) . These observations reveal that like FLS2 , activated PEPR1 and EFR are cargoes of the late endocytic trafficking route . Interestingly , the internalization - deficient FLS2 D997N - GFP colocalized with FLS2 - mCherry at endosomes after flg22 treatment ( Fig . S3 B ) . Because FLS2 can form homo - oligomers in the absence and presence of flg22 ( 21 ) , we hypothesize that FLS2 D997N is internalized as oligomer complex together with signaling - competent FLS2 ( 4 ) . Endosomal Trafficking of Activated PRRs Is Shared with BRI1 . Endocy - tosis is also known for the BAK1 - dependent hormone receptor BRI1 ( 8 , 9 ) . To gain insight into BRI1 trafficking in N . benthamiana leaves , we pairwise - coexpressed BRI1 - GFP with MEMB12 - mCherry , Vha - A1 - RFP , mCherry - ARA7 / RabF2b , and ARA6 / RabF1 - RFP BRI1 - positive vesicles colocalized with the endosomal markers ARA7 / RabF2b and ARA6 / RabF1 - RFP ( Fig . S6 A ) , in agreement with BRI1 vacuolar trafficking ( 22 ) . Heterologous coexpression of BRI1 - GFP and FLS2 - mCherry in N . benthamiana revealed colocalization at vesicles after flg22 elicitation ( Fig . S6 B ) . Fig . 2 .

PNAS Early Edition | 3 of 6 P L A N T B I O L O G Y Colocalization of BRI1 - GFP at FLS2 - mCherry endosomes oc - curred with a similar Pearson ’ s correlation coefficient value as for the FLS2 - GFP / FLS2 - mCherry pair . Like heterologously expressed BRI1 - GFP in N . benthamiana , cotyledons of stably expressing BRI1 - GFP Arabidopsis lines showed the presence of BRI1 at the plasma membrane and mobile vesicles . TAMRA - flg22 colocalized to these vesicles ( Fig . S6 C ) . Internalization of Activated PRRs Depends on Clathrin . Both clathrin - dependent and - independent internalization mechanisms have been described in plants ( 23 , 24 ) . Because clathrin has been shown to function in BRI1 endocytosis ( 9 ) , we addressed genetically whether clathrin is required for the internalization of PRRs . To overcome potential genetic redundancy , we knocked down the six CLATHRIN HEAVY CHAIN ( NbCHC ) constructs found in the N . benthamiana genome ( 25 ) by transient expression of a single hairpin construct ( Fig . S7 A ) . Heterologously expressed FLS2 - GFP exhibited normal plasma membrane localization in NbCHC - silenced N . benthamiana leaves . Quantification of FLS2 endosomes after flg22 treatment revealed an approximate 75 % decrease in NbCHC - silenced leaves vs . control ( Fig . 4 A and Fig . S7 B ) . Pep1 - induced endosomal numbers of PEPR1 - YFP were reduced by ap - proximately 50 % in NbCHCs - silenced leaves ( Fig . S7 C ) . In the case of FLS2 , we observed an increase in average size for the remaining endosomes detected in NbCHC - silenced leaves ( Fig . 4 A ) , which can be explained by a concomitant decrease in the numbers of small endosomes and the presence of abnormally enlarged structures . These structures did not colocalize with mCherry - ARA7 / RabF2b , indicating defects in the normal endosomal trafficking of FLS2 - GFP ( Fig . S7 D ) . We also noticed that the mCherry - ARA7 / RabF2b – positive vesicles were increased in size ( Fig . S7 D ) , con - sistent with the involvement of clathrin in vesicle trafficking from the TGN / early endosome ( 26 ) . These data suggest that clathrin plays a role in the endocytosis of FLS2 and PEPR1 receptors . In Arabidopsis , two related genes , CHC1 and CHC2 , encode clathrin heavy chains , of which chc2 mutants were shown to affect endocytic events from the plasma membrane ( 23 ) . To investigate whether FLS2 endocytosis is mediated by CHC2 in Arabidopsis , we treated cotyledons of chc2 - 1 mutants with TAMRA - flg22 . Micro - scopic observation and quantification revealed that TAMRA - flg22 – positive vesicles increased in WT cotyledons to a maximum level at 40 – 60 min after treatment ( Fig . 4 B and Fig . S8 A ) , mirroring the dy - namic behavior of ligand - induced FLS2 endocytosis ( 5 ) . In contrast , the number of TAMRA - flg22 – positive vesicles remained unchanged above background noise in chc2 - 1 cotyledons ( Fig . 4 B ) . Similar results were obtained with the independent chc2 - 3 mutant allele ( Fig . S9 A ) . Clathrin Is Rrequired for Immunity Against Bacterial Infection . Our cell biology studies revealed that endocytosis of plasma membrane - located receptors triggering plant immunity is dependent on clathrin function . This finding provided an opportunity to address whether PRR - mediated immunity is associated with trafficking by clathrin . Thus , we examined the growth of Pto DC3000 and two virulence - compromised strains in chc2 - 1 mutant lines . Following spray in - fection of fully virulent Pto DC3000 , a strain lacking coronatine ( cor - ) known to promote bacterial entry through stomata ( 27 ) , and a strain defective in type III secretion of virulence effectors ( hrcC - ) , growth of all bacterial strains was significantly higher in chc2 - 1 mutants com - pared with Col - 0 WT ( Fig . 4 C ) . Similar results were obtained in chc2 - 3 mutants ( Fig . S9 B ) , and are consistent with increased Pto DC3000 and Pto DC3000 hrcC - infection in knockout mutants of DYNAMIN - RELATED PROTEIN ( DRP ) 2b ( 28 ) , components associated with the clathrin machinery .

( Fig . S10 A and B ) . This finding confirms a specific role of CHC2 as a positive regulator of defense against bacteria independent of the delivery of cor - and type III secreted effectors . Clathrin Is Not Required for PRR - Mediated Acute Immune Responses . PRR - mediated immunity involves the activation of various defense responses , including the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , activation of MAP kinases , stomatal closure , and callose deposition ( 2 ) . We tested whether the inhibition of clathrin - mediated endocytosis interferes with any of these MAMP responses . The flg22 - induced ROS production mediated by the plasma membrane NADPH oxidase RbohD in Arabidopsis was little af - fected in leaves of chc2 - 1 mutants , which exhibited slightly elevated ROS during its down - regulation compared with Col - 0 WT ( Fig . S8 B and C ) ; however , we did not observe vastly prolonged production of ROS , indicating that down - regulation of the flg22 - induced ROS burst is independent of FLS2 endocytosis . Similar results were obtained in NbCHC - silenced N . benthamiana leaves ( Fig . S7 E ) . These findings demonstrate that the ROS burst is most likely con - ferred by plasma membrane - localized FLS2 , in line with the acti - vation of RbohD via an upstream calcium influx , calcium - dependent protein kinases , and BOTRYTIS INDUCED KINASE ( BIK1 ) ( 29 , 30 ) . Although our results are in disagreement with other findings showing opposing outcomes of either strongly reduced or prolonged oxidative bursts upon inhibition of flg22 - induced FLS2 degradation or endocytosis , respectively ( 31 , 32 ) , we cannot exclude the possi - bility of additional effects from the chemical approaches used in these studies or from the activities of clathrin - mediated endocytosis regulating RbohD localization ( 33 ) . Knockout of CHC1 did not alter the flg22 - triggered ROS burst ( Fig . S10 C ) . We next monitored the activation of MAPKs found to be phosphorylated on MAMP treatment in Arabidopsis ( 2 ) . Activa - tion of MAPKs was induced at 15 and 30 min after flg22 elicitation in WT and chc2 - 1 plants ( Fig . S8 D ) . In both Col - 0 WT and chc2 - 1 , MAPK activation returned to basal levels by 60 min after treat - ment . Similarly , flg22 treatment induced activation of MAPK in NbCHC - silenced N . benthamiana leaves ( Fig . S7 F ) . These results suggest that clathrin is not required for the transient activation of MAPKs , and are consistent with previous results obtained from chemical interference and drp2b mutants ( 11 , 28 ) . Although it is possible that both clathrin depletion in N . benthamiana leaves and chc2 knockout in Arabidopsis do not fully inhibit endocytosis , our data suggest that plasma membrane - resident FLS2 is sufficient to induce transient MAPK activation . Clathrin Is Involved in PRR - Mediated Callose Deposition and Stomatal Closure . An important component of MAMP - mediated immunity is the restriction of pathogen entry through closure of stomata ( 27 ) . To invade leaves , Pto DC3000 secretes cor - , which triggers stomatal opening . Therefore , we measured stomatal apertures under control conditions and after treatment with flg22 and abscisic acid ( ABA ) , a hormone that induces stomatal closure in drought stress . We found that stomatal closure induced by flg22 , but not by ABA , was significantly impaired in chc2 - 1 mutants ( Fig . 4 D ) . Flg22 elicited the closure of stomata in chc1 loss - of - function mutants ( Fig . S10 D ) . These results indicate that CHC2 , but not CHC1 , participates in flg22 - triggered stomatal immunity , thereby leading to the increased growth of Pto DC3000 cor - bacteria in chc2 , but not chc1 , mutants . Thus , endocytosis of FLS2 appears to be positively correlated with stomatal immunity , consistent with impaired flg22 - induced stoma - tal closure and FLS2 endosomal sorting in vps37 - 1 mutants ( 10 ) . Given that the flg22 - induced ROS burst , a critical response in stomatal closure ( 30 ) , was not impaired in chc2 mutants , we also quantified the deposition of callose , which has been implicated in stomatal closure ( 34 ) , in response to flg22 . We found that Flg22 - induced callose deposition was significantly impaired in chc2 - 1 and chc2 - 3 mutants compared with Col - 0 WT ( Fig . 4 E and Fig . S9 C ) . No difference in callose deposition was observed between wounded chc2 - 1 and Col - 0 WT ( Fig . S8 E ) , demonstrating that CHC2 is specifically required for flg22 - induced callose deposition . Interestingly , chc2 mutants exhibited enhanced callose deposition on infection with the Erysiphe cichoracearum fungal pathogen ( 35 ) , which could involve aspects of effector - triggered immunity . The finding that flg22 - induced callose deposition is inhibited in chc2 mutants contrasts with the WT - like and increased callose deposi - tion in flg22 - treated vps37 - 1 and drp2b mutants , respectively ( 10 , 28 ) ; however , both vps37 - 1 and drp2b exhibited mildly reduced FLS2 endocytosis . It is also possible that clathrin or DRP2b affects the plasma membrane localization of POWDERY MILDEW RESISTANT4 ( PMR4 ) , the callose synthase responsible for flg22 - induced callose production ( 2 ) . Our data reveal that ligand - induced endocytosis is a conserved mechanism integral to the cellular dynamics of all tested PRR kinases of the plant ’ s immune system .

PNAS Early Edition | 5 of 6 P L A N T B I O L O G Y activated receptors colocalize at endosomes reveals converging endocytic routes that likely join at ARA7 / RabF2b endosomes . This highlights a common pathway for the transport of activated plant receptors , supporting the hypothesis that all receptors are targeted to the same final destination , possibly the vacuole . This extends to the receptor - like protein PRRs Cf - 4 and LeEix2 , which reportedly localize to late endosomes ( 12 , 13 ) , as well as to the BRI1 hor - mone receptor . It provides evidence that this pathway is common across different types of PRR families and receptor kinases , pos - sibly to accumulate cargoes before delivery to the vacuole . Inter - estingly , pathogens secrete effectors that interfere with DRP2 function and cause the relocation of endosomal FLS2 to infection sites ( 36 , 37 ) indicating that this common endosomal pathway is targeted by pathogens to suppress PRR - mediated immunity . Our receptor coexpression and ligand uptake experiments re - vealed that only liganded PRRs were internalized , demonstrating the specificity of receptor - mediated endocytosis . This implies the absence of strong molecular interactions between these distinct re - ceptors , although all engage with BAK1 to reconstitute active sig - naling complexes required for their endocytosis . Using clathrin knockout to genetically inhibit PRR internalization , we determined that acute flg22 - triggered responses are most likely conferred from the plasma membrane . Nevertheless , we found that CHC2 is a positive regulator of flg22 - induced callose deposition and stomatal immunity contributing to the defenses against bacterial infection ( 10 , 28 ) . Thus , our observations provide evidence that CHC2 - mediated endocytosis positively affects MAMP - triggered immunity , and establish that the regulation of endocytic trafficking is critical for the full deployment of plants ’ immune response to pathogen attack .
