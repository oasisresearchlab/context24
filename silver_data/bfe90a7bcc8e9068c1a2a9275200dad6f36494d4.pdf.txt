At present , the relative effect of environmental and genetic fac - tors of COVID - 19 is unknown . This research presents a Monte Carlo ( MC ) estimation of the genetic narrow - sense heritabil - ity of COVID - 19 infection and severity from AncestryDNA survey data . The results suggest a moderate genetic contribu - tion to COVID - 19 infection and a low genetic contribution for COVID - 19 severity . Introduction Many regard the emergence of COVID - 19 , caused by se - vere acute respiratory syndrome 2 ( SARS - Cov - 2 ) , to be the greatest public health crisis of the past century . Effective man - agement of infectious disease outbreaks , such as COVID - 19 , requires data - driven public health management . Often , public health management of infectious diseases is pathogen cen - tered . This approach makes the assumption that the pathogen , itself , dictates the course of the disease . However , research has shown that genetics of the host may also contribute to infectious disease burden ( Klebanov 2018 ) . Respiratory in - fectious diseases , like COVID - 19 , also demonstrate a host genetic component that contributes to inter - individual differ - ences ( Patarˇci´c et al . 2015 ) . This contribution of the host’s genetics , in tandem with environmental factors , determines disease susceptibility and infection . Understanding the rela - tive effect of environmental and genetic factors of respiratory infectious diseases may be helpful to guide public health intervention . Genetic heritability summarizes the variation in observable characteristics – or phenotype – that is attributable to a varia - tion in genetics rather than the environment or random effects . High genetic heritability indicates a strong phenotypic simi - larity between parents and offspring that is due to genetics , while low heritability indicates a low phenotypic similarity . A subset of genetic heritability is narrow - sense heritability ( h 2 ) . h 2 is the average proportion of total phenotypic variance that Copyright © 2022 , Please direct all questions and com - ments to corresponding author , Amelia J Averitt , at amelia . averitt @ regeneron . com is due to additive genetic factors that are passed from parents to offspring . When discussing respiratory infectious diseases , knowledge of h 2 can help inform public health interventions . In situations of uncertainty , as is the case with COVID - 19 , h 2 estimates of disease susceptibility and severity may provide evidence of how the disease will , on average , affect fami - lies . This may enable clinicians to appropriately intervene on or monitor family groups and aid in allocation of medical resources . Typically , heritability estimates , such as h 2 , are made via twin studies . In such studies , phenotypes of monozygotic ( identical ) twins are compared with phenotypes of dizygotic ( fraternal ) twins ( Visscher , Hill , and Wray 2008 ) . Though twin studies are robust to genetic and environmental con - founders , they suffer from many limitations . They are in - efficient , could result in an overestimation of heritability ; and the study population may not be representative of the larger population , which could limit generalizability . Heri - tability estimates have also been made from the electronic health records , but often require lengthy patient recruitment , familial ascertainment , and phenotype identification ( Polu - briaginof et al . 2018 ) . Methods The Method This research presents a Monte Carlo ( MC ) estimation of the narrow - sense heritability of COVID - 19 in - fection and severity from AncestryDNA survey data . This data is from a private collaboration with AncestryDNA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and was collected online from volunteer respondents . The survey was given to Ances - tryDNA customers ( N210k ) and aimed to assess each respon - dent’s COVID - 19 infection status , exposure , risk factors , and symptoms . This data includes , if and which biological family members were infected with and hospitalized from COVID - 19 , which can be used for h 2 estimation . Unlike traditional data for this task , the AncestryDNA survey data is borne from a large and heterogenous population , familial relationships are easily identified , and COVID - 19 phenotypes are defined . Clinical data is preferred when making h 2 estimates , but re - search demonstrates that self - reported data – such as survey data – yields concordance of heritability estimates from a sufficiently large sample ( Macgregor et al . 2006 ) . .

In the circumstance when a parent is infected with or hospi - talized from COVID - 19 , this survey’s responses fail to spec - ify whether one or two parents were affected . This research uses an MC method to stochastically estimate the parent’s phenotypic variance using parameters that are grounded in real - world epidemiologic evidence . MC methods are a class of algorithms that rely on repeated sampling to make esti - mates that cannot be directly made . Over many sampling iterations , estimates derived from an MC procedure will the - oretically converge with the true value . Our MC method is summarized in Algorithm 1 . For this algorithm , if a respon - dent ( proband ) has one or more parents were infected or hospitalized , the count of afflicted parents is initialized to 1 . Stochastic parameters for the simulation include the rate of two - parent households ( η ) ( United States Census Bureau 2019 ) ; rate of household co - infection ( ρ ) ( Li et al . 2020 ) ( Gri - jalva et al . 2020 ) ( Fung et al . 2021 ) ; and the rate of hospital - ization among COVID infected individuals ( ψ ) ( Garg et al . 2020 ) . h 2 is then estimated from the slope of a linear regres - sion that models the simulated , mid - phenotypic value of the parents by the phenotypic value of the proband . Algorithm 1 : Pseudocode for Monte Carlo ( MC ) Estimation . Where , N is the number of iterations ; J is number of observations in data ; and x j is number of parents in household for proband j .

Simulation To evaluate the proposed method , we applied our estimation procedure to data in which the ground - truth h 2 is known . Proband and parent phenotypes were simulated such that the ‘true’ h 2 was hard - coded into the data . If 1 or 2 parents were affected , the data was then masked to only indicate if 1 or more was affected , which aligns with the uncertainty in the AncestryDNA data . The MC algorithm was applied to this masked , simulated data and an h 2 estimate was made . This experimental set - up was repeated 1000 times using varying ‘true’ h 2 values of 0 . 1 , 0 . 3 and 0 . 5 . Results When applied to simulated data , in which ground - truth h 2 is known , the method is able to recover h 2 with high accuracy ( Table 1 ) . Presuming that the parameters are true , this indicates that the proposed method can recover h 2 with minimal bias .

Application to AncestryDNA Survey Data To estimate h 2 from the AncestryDNA data , proband pheno - types for COVID - 19 infection and severity were binarized . Cases of proband COVID - 19 infection ( 2 . 24 % ) were identi - fied as respondents who reported any of the following ( i ) a swab - test for COVID - 19 that was positive ; ( ii ) no swab - test for COVID - 19 , but respondent had flu - like symptoms after February 2020 ; or ( iii ) an antibody test for COVID - 19 that was positive . From the population of infection cases , severe COVID - 19 ( 0 . 25 % ) probands were defined as respondents who reported any of the following ( i ) hospitalization due to COVID - 19 ; ( ii ) hospitalization in the ICU with oxygen ; or ( iii ) hospitalization in the ICU with a ventilator . Cases were assigned a phenotype of 1 . In the absence of case re - quirements for either phenotype , the proband phenotype was 0 . Parents of a proband that did not report that their “Par - ent ( s ) ” were infected or hospitalized due to COVID - 19 were assigned a phenotype of 0 for both outcomes . In the event that a proband reported that “Parent ( s ) ” were infected or hos - pitalized due to COVID - 19 , this data was passed into the MC simulation to stochastically model the parent phenotype ; if 1 or 2 parents were infected ( p i ) and hospitalized ( p h ) . Models for both phenotypes of interest , were adjusted for the age , gender , and ever - smoking status of the proband . Given the high variability in reported household co - infection , ρ , the MC simulation was repeated using three reported statis - tics to inform this parameter ( Li et al . 2020 ) ( Grijalva et al . 2020 ) ( Fung et al . 2021 ) . Results The results of the application to AncestryDNA survey data indicate that h 2 of COVID - 19 infection sus - ceptibility ranges from 0 . 1554 to 0 . 1833 . When ρ = 0 . 163 , h 2 inf = 0 . 1554 [ 0 . 136 , 0 . 175 ] ; when ρ = 0 . 170 h 2 inf = 0 . 1577 [ 0 . 138 , 0 . 178 ] ; and when ρ = 0 . 530 , h 2 inf = 0 . 1833 [ 0 . 157 , 0 . 212 ] . h 2 of COVID - 19 severity ranges from 0 . 0734 to .

When ρ = 0 . 163 , h 2 sev = 0 . 0734 [ 0 . 00370 , 0 . 00610 ] ; when ρ = 0 . 170 h 2 sev = 0 . 0751 [ 0 . 00368 , 0 . 00615 ] ; and when ρ = 0 . 530 , h 2 sev = 0 . 0705 [ 0 . 00303 , 0 . 00611 ] . These results sug - gest a moderate genetic contribution to COVID - 19 infection and a low genetic contribution for COVID - 19 severity ( Fig - ure 1 ) . For context , h 2 of height is 0 . 8 ( Macgregor et al . 2006 ) . Discussion This research provides evidence that variability in infection by SARS - Cov - 2 is , in part , explained by inherited genetic factors . Clinicians and public health professionals should be mindful of inherited disease susceptibility and monitor biological family members of the infected . These estimates may also provide context for genetic contribution to infection severity and hospitalization for disease variants and other pathogens . However , this approach does not account for re - cessive effects or gene - gene interaction and is reliant upon the estimated parameters . furthermore , this research and abstract was completed in March 2020 . COVID research , including our understanding of genetic mechanisms of disease and epidemiologic parameters , have matured since this time .
