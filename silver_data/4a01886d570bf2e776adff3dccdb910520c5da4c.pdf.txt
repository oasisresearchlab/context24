Cell Death and Disease ( 2023 ) 14 : 167 ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41419 - 023 - 05644 - z INTRODUCTION Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is the third most common cancer and second most common cause of cancer - related deaths worldwide [ 1 ] . Although molecular targeted therapy ( e . g . , bevacizumab , cetuximab ) improves the survival of metastatic CRC patients , and PD - 1 or CTLA4 inhibitors bene ﬁ t metastatic CRC patients with d - MMR / MSI - H , metastasis is the leading cause of CRC - related death [ 2 – 7 ] . Unfortunately , the mechanisms of CRC metastasis remain to be elucidated , which impedes the prevention and treatment of CRC . Recently , it was reported that CEMIP ( cell migration - inducing and hyaluronan - binding protein ) was associated with migration , invasion and drug resistance in various tumors [ 8 – 14 ] , particularly in colon cancer , breast cancer , stomach cancer . For instance , Evensen et al . reported that CEMIP interacted with Bip in endoplasmic reticulum , which led to Ca 2 + release and activate PKC α signaling , then accelerated metastasis of breast cancer [ 8 ] . Rodrigues et al . demonstrated that tumor exosomal CEMIP protein promoted cancer cell colonization in brain metastasis through up - regulation of CCL / CXCL cytokines [ 10 ] . In terms of CRC , our previous studies showed that over - expression of CEMIP predicted poor outcomes of CRC patients and was positively correlated with CRC metastasis [ 15 – 17 ] , and CEMIP facilitated the in ﬁ ltration of immunosuppressive neutrophils and drove immune suppression via the TGF β - CXCL3 / 1 - CXCR2 axis in liver metastasis [ 18 ] . Collectively , CEMIP is potential to serve as a therapeutic target for tumor metastasis . However , the underlying molecular network of CEMIP promoting CRC metastasis is still not fully understood . GRAF1 ( also named ARHGAP26 ) was reported to be a tumor suppressor that was functionally or genetically inactivated in several tumors , including gastric cancer , ovarian cancer , and metastatic brain cancer [ 19 – 22 ] . GRAF1 was comprised of a BAR domain , a PH domain , a RhoGAP domain , and a SH3 domain which was originally identi ﬁ ed binding to focal adhesion kinase [ 23 , 24 ] . And GRAF1 was known as a GTPase activating protein that mediated the activity of GTP binding proteins Rho A and CDC42 [ 23 – 25 ] . Nevertheless , the regulatory mechanism of biological function and expression level of GRAF1 in tumorigenesis remained elusive . In this study , we identify CEMIP interacting with GRAF1 , and the combination of high - CEMIP and low - GRAF1 predicts poor survival of patients . Mechanistically , we elucidated that the 295 – 819aa domain of CEMIP interacted with the SH3 domain of GRAF1 , and negatively regulates the stability of GRAF1 .

Subsequently , we proved that CDC42 inhibitor suppressed CEMIP - mediated CRC metastasis in vitro and in vivo . Collectively , our results suggested that CDC42 inhibitor could be a novel therapeutic strategy for CEMIP - mediated CRC metastasis . RESULTSIdenti ﬁ cation of GRAF1 as a binding protein for CEMIP Our previous studies demonstrated that the elevated expression of CEMIP was closely related to poor outcomes and promoted CRC metastasis [ 15 – 18 ] . To elucidate the molecular mechanism network involved in CEMIP - mediated CRC metastasis , we con - ducted co - immunoprecipitation ( Co - IP ) and mass - spectrometric ( MS ) peptide sequencing to identify CEMIP - interacting proteins in cells . In view of the MS score ( top 5 ) and biological function of the potential CEMIP - binding proteins , we were interested in GRAF1 ( Supplementary Fig . S1A , B and Supplementary Table S1 ) . GRAF1 had been proved to be a cancer suppressor which inhibited the progression of gastric , ovarian , lung and colorectal cancer [ 19 – 22 , 26 ] . Our bioinformatics analyses showed that CRC patients with high - GRAF1 had better overall survival ( OS ) than patients with low - GRAF1 but not progression - free survival ( PFS ) ( Supple - mentary Fig . S1C ) , while CRC patients with high - CEMIP had shorter PFS than patients with low - CEMIP but not OS ( Supplementary Fig . S1D ) . It indicated that GRAF1 or CEMIP alone could not predict both of PFS and OS of patients . However , we found that CRC patients with high - CEMIP + low - GRAF1 , high - CEMIP + high - GRAF1 , had worse PFS and OS than patients with low - CEMIP + high - GRAF1 , low - CEMIP + low - GRAF1 respectively ( Fig . 1A , B ) , suggesting that the combination of CEMIP and GRAF1 could effectively predict the survival of patients . Moreover , our results con ﬁ rmed that GRAF1 inhibited the migration and invasion of CRC cells in vitro ( Fig . 1C and Supplementary Fig . S1E ) . Therefore , these data uncovered GRAF1 as a promising candidate of CEMIP - interacting protein . To further validate the interaction between CEMIP and GRAF1 , we performed a series of Co - IP experiments . As showed in Fig . 1D , the endogenous interaction between CEMIP and GRAF1 was observed in CRC cells . Furthermore , exogenous CEMIP was able to bind to exogenous GRAF1 , and vice versa ( Fig . 1E , F ) . Importantly , the Duolink proximity ligation assays further con ﬁ rmed a direct linkage between CEMIP and GRAF1 ( Fig . 1G ) . Collectively , these ﬁ ndings strongly suggested that CEMIP physically interacted with GRAF1 directly . CEMIP interacts with the SH3 domain of GRAF1 through the 295 – 819aa domain To further investigate which domain of CEMIP was required for binding to GRAF1 , we constructed six truncated variants of CEMIP with a C - terminal myc tag ( CEMIP - myc - Δ 1 : 1 – 303aa ; CEMIP - myc - Δ 2 : 295 – 591aa ; CEMIP - myc - Δ 3 : 572 – 819aa ; CEMIP - myc - Δ 4 : 820 – 1204aa ; CEMIP - myc - Δ 5 : 1205 – 1361aa ; CEMIP - myc - Δ 2 + 3 : 295 – 819aa ) , as indicated in Supplementary Fig . S2A . Each of truncated CEMIP variants and GRAF1 plasmids were co - expressed in HEK293T cells respectively . Then the co - immunoprecipitation assay was performed using the whole cell lysates . As illustrated in Supplementary Fig . S2B , C , CEMIP - myc - Δ 2 , CEMIP - myc - Δ 3 and CEMIP - myc - Δ 2 + 3 were observed to bind to GRAF1 . Therefore , these results demonstrated that the 295 – 819aa domain of CEMIP was indispensable for binding to GRAF1 . It was reported that , the SH3 domain of GRAF1 was conserved in different species ( Supplementary Fig . S3A ) and could be interacted with various proteins such as CDC42 and TGF - β R , which was crucial for the downstream signaling [ 23 , 27 ] . To further determine whether the SH3 domain of GRAF1 was required for binding to CEMIP , we generated the GRAF1 deletion mutant without the SH3 domain ( GRAF1 - Δ SH3 ) , as indicated in Supple - mentary Fig . S3B [ 23 ] . The GRAF1 - Δ SH3 variant and CEMIP plasmids were co - expressed in HCT116 cells , then the co - immunoprecipitation assay was performed . The results showed that GRAF1 - Δ SH3 could not bind to CEMIP ( Supplementary Fig . S3C – E ) , which indicated that GRAF1 interacted with CEMIP via the SH3 domain . Together , these results demonstrated that the 295 – 819aa domain of CEMIP interacts with the SH3 domain of GRAF1 . CEMIP negatively regulates the stability of GRAF1 Having proved a physical interaction between the two molecules , we next evaluated the effect of CEMIP on GRAF1 . As shown in Fig . 2A , knock - down of CEMIP dramatically resulted in the accumula - tion of endogenous GRAF1 , while exogenously expressed CEMIP resulted in the decrease of endogenous GRAF1 . Interestingly , no obvious variations were observed between the mRNA levels of GRAF1 when CEMIP was down - regulated or up - regulated ( Sup - plementary Fig . S4 ) . Moreover , no matter whether down - regulating CEMIP level in cells , treatment with MG132 ( protea - some inhibitor ) led to increased GRAF1 protein level ( Fig . 2B ) , which suggested that CEMIP probably regulated the protein stability of GRAF1 through the ubiquitin / proteasome system . In line with the above observation , ubiquitination assays showed that exogenously expressed CEMIP led to the increased ubiqui - tination level of GRAF1 ( Fig . 2C ) , and knock - down of CEMIP remarkably increased the half - life of GRAF1 ( Fig . 2D ) . Furthermore , we detected the protein levels of CEMIP and GRAF1 in CRC tissues by immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . The results indicated that there was a negative correlation between CEMIP and GRAF1 ( Fig . 2E , and Supplementary Tables S2 , S3 ) . Importantly , considering that CEMIP bond to the SH3 domain of GRAF1 , we found that CEMIP promoted the ubiquitination level and reduced the half - life of wild GRAF1 but not the mutated GRAF1 without SH3 domain ( Fig . 2F , G ) , indicating that the interaction of CEMIP with GRAF1 was indispensable for the stability of GRAF1 . Therefore , these ﬁ ndings demonstrated that CEMIP negatively regulated the stability of GRAF1 by enhancing its ubiquitination and degradation . Identi ﬁ cation of MIB1 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for GRAF1 Given that CEMIP promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of GRAF1 , we wondered whether CEMIP was a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase for GRAF1 . However , we found no canonical catalytic structure of E3 ubiquitin ligase in the domain of CEMIP by analyzing the amino acid sequence . Hence , we hypothesized that CEMIP regulated the ubiquitination level of GRAF1 by relying on an E3 ubiquitin ligase . To verify this hypothesis , we retrieved the UbiBrowser database ( http : / / ubibrowser . ncpsb . org / ) and screened the potential E3 ubiquitin ligases of GRAF1 ( Fig . 3A and Supplementary Fig . S5A ) . Then we performed Co - IP assays to test which E3 ligase binding to GRAF1 . However , we found none of top 5 potential E3 ligases binding to GRAF1 . Fortunately , we changed the detection strategy and found MIB1 , the 11th potential E3 ligases , could bind to GRAF1 ( Fig . 3B ) . Hence MIB1 was regarded as the target of our research . Moreover , we showed that MIB1 interacted with GRAF1 both at the exogenous and endogenous level ( Fig . 3B – D and Supplementary Fig . S5B ) . Importantly , as showed in Fig . 3E , F , MIB1 was predicted to binding the RhoGAP domain of GRAF1 in the UbiBrowser database , and the Co - IP assays showed that MIB1 could bind to the mutated GRAF1 without SH3 domain , indicating that MIB1 may interact with the RhoGAP domain of GRAF1 but not SH3 domain . Furthermore , the Duolink proximity ligation assays con ﬁ rmed a direct linkage between GRAF1 and MIB1 ( Fig . 3G ) . Therefore , these results demonstrated that MIB1 was a candidate E3 ubiquitin ligase for GRAF1 . Notably , we found that MIB1 regulated the protein level but not the mRNA level of GRAF1 , while MIB1 had no effect on both protein and mRNA level of CEMIP ( Fig . 3H and Supplementary Fig . G . Xu et al . 2 Cell Death and Disease ( 2023 ) 14 : 167 S5C , D ) . And knock - down of MIB1 signi ﬁ cantly decreased the ubiquitination level of GRAF1 ( Fig . 3I ) . Collectively , these ﬁ ndings strongly suggested that MIB1 was an E3 ubiquitin ligase for GRAF1 . CEMIP acts as a scaffold protein in bridging GRAF1 and MIB1 , which is critical to GRAF1 degradation Based on these ﬁ ndings , we hypothesized that CEMIP acted as an adaptor protein in promoting the interaction of GRAF1 and its E3 Fig . 1 CEMIP has negative correlation with GRAF1 in CRC .

Xu et al . 3 Cell Death and Disease ( 2023 ) 14 : 167 ubiquitin ligase MIB1 . To investigate the relationship between CEMIP and MIB1 , we performed Co - IP assays and observed that CEMIP could interact with MIB1 both at the exogenous and endogenous level ( Fig . 4A , B and Supplementary Fig . S6A , B ) . Moreover , as showed in Fig . 4C and Supplementary Fig . S6C , we indicated that CEMIP interacted with MIB1 though CEMIP - myc - Δ 4 ( the 820 – 1204aa domain ) but not CEMIP - myc - Δ 2 and - Δ 3 ( the 295 – 819aa domain ) which bound to GRAF1 . Furthermore , the Duolink proximity ligation G . Xu et al . 4 Cell Death and Disease ( 2023 ) 14 : 167 assays showed a direct linkage between CEMIP and MIB1 ( Fig . 4D ) . Therefore , it suggested that CEMIP interacted with MIB1 though the 820 – 1204aa domain . Notably , we observed that knock - down of CEMIP weakened the interaction of GRAF1 and MIB1 , while exogenously expressed CEMIP enhanced the interaction of GRAF1 and MIB1 , indicating that CEMIP promoted the interaction of GRAF1 and MIB1 ( Fig . 4E and supplementary Fig . S6D ) . In addition , silence of CEMIP or MIB1 signi ﬁ cantly attenuated the ubiquitination of GRAF1 ( Fig . 4F ) . Together , these results demonstrated that CEMIP acted as a scaffold protein in bridging GRAF1 and MIB1 , which was critical to GRAF1 degradation . CEMIP promotes metastasis of CRC cells by bridging GRAF1 and MIB1 Our previous data demonstrated that CEMIP promoted CRC metastasis . Here , we found that exogenously expressed GRAF1 attenuated CEMIP - mediated migration and invasion of CRC cells , while knock - down of GRAF1 promoted the migration and invasion of CRC cells which was inhibited by silence of CEMIP ( Fig . 5A , Supplementary Fig . S7A ) . Moreover , to determine the relation of CEMIP and GRAF1 in vivo , we structured liver metastases model of BALB / c nude mice by intrasplenic injection . Compared to control group , it developed more liver metastases in CEMIP group , while less liver metastases in GRAF1 group . Importantly , liver metastases in CEMIP + GRAF1 group were signi ﬁ cantly less than in CEMIP group , indicating that GRAF1 attenuated CEMIP - mediated liver metastasis ( Fig . 5B ) . Consis - tently , it showed more weight loss and shorter survival of mice in CEMIP group compared with CEMIP + GRAF1 group , indicating that GRAF1 alleviated CEMIP - mediated weight loss and pro - longed survival of mice ( Fig . 5C , D ) . The IHC assays con ﬁ rmed a negatively correlation between of CEMIP and GRAF1 ( Fig . 5E ) . Furthermore , we observed that exogenously expressed CEMIP promoted the migration and invasion of CRC cells , which was weakened by knock - down of MIB1 ( Fig . 5F ) . While suppression of MIB1 further depressed the migration and invasion of CRC cells which were inhibited by silencing CEMIP ( Supplementary Fig . S7B ) . Summarily , we demonstrated that CEMIP promotes the metastasis of CRC cells by bridging GRAF1 and MIB1 . CEMIP activates CDC42 / MAPK pathway through inhibiting GRAF1 It was reported that GRAF1 regulated the expression of CDC42 , which was able to activate the PAK1 / MAPK pathway and led to the migration and invasion of cancer cells [ 28 , 29 ] . Notably , our mRNA sequencing and KEGG ( Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ) analyses showed a negative correlation between GRAF1 and the MAPK pathway ( Supplementary Fig . S8A and Supplementary Table S4 ) , and GESA ( Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ) analyses showed that CEMIP was positively associated with MAPK pathway ( Supplementary Fig . S8B ) , suggesting that CEMIP promoted the migration and invasion of CRC cells though GRAF1 / CDC42 / PAK1 / MAPK axis . In accordance with that , down - regulation of CEMIP resulted in the suppression of CDC42 / PAK1 / MAPK pathway but the increase of GRAF1 , while up - regulation of CEMIP led to the hyper - activation of CDC42 / PAK1 / MAPK path - way but the decrease of GRAF1 ( Supplementary Fig . S8C ) . Moreover , we observed that CEMIP - mediated activation of CDC42 / PAK1 / MAPK pathway was attenuated by silence of MIB1 , and a similar synergistic effect of knock - down both of CEMIP and MIB1 to inhibit CDC42 / PAK1 / MAPK pathway ( Supple - mentary Fig . S8D , E ) . Furthermore , in liver metastases model of BALB / c nude mice , IHC data showed that exogenously expressed GRAF1 attenuated CEMIP - mediated CDC42 / MAPK pathway ( Sup - plementary Fig . S8F ) . In addition , CDC42 inhibitor ( ZCL278 ) blocked CEMIP - activated CDC42 / PAK1 / MAPK pathway ( Supple - mentary Fig . S9A ) , and knock - down of CEMIP inhibited CDC42 / PAK1 / MAPK pathway , which was further suppressed by CDC42 inhibitor ( Supplementary Fig . S9B ) . Therefore , these ﬁ ndings indicated that CEMIP promotes CDC42 / MAPK pathway through inhibiting GRAF1 . CEMIP promotes metastasis of CRC cells through GRAF1 / CDC42 / MAPK pathway - regulated EMT Considering we had proved that CEMIP activated CDC42 / MAPK pathway , and it was reported that MAPK signaling was a key regulator of epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and tumor metastasis , we deduced that CEMIP promoted CRC metastasis via MAPK signaling - induced EMT [ 30 , 31 ] . We found that CEMIP and MIB1 had a synergistic effect in the up - regulation of EMT in CRC cells ( Fig . 6A , Supplementary Fig . S10A ) . Moreover , we showed that CDC42 inhibitor ( ZCL278 ) could signi ﬁ cantly weaken CEMIP - induced EMT ( Fig . 6B ) , and knock - down of CEMIP inhibited EMT of CRC cells , which was further suppressed by CDC42 inhibitor ( Supplementary Fig . S10B ) . It suggested that CEMIP promoted EMT of CRC cells through GRAF1 / CDC42 / MAPK pathway . Then we validated the correlation of CEMIP - mediated CRC metastasis and CDC42 / MAPK pathway - regulated EMT . Our results indicated that up - regulation of CEMIP increased the migration and invasion of CRC cells , which was attenuated by CDC42 inhibitor ( Fig . 6C ) . Meanwhile , knock - down of CEMIP decreased the migration and invasion of CRC cells , which was further suppressed by CDC42 inhibitor ( Supplementary Fig . S10C ) . Moreover , in liver metastases model of BALB / c nude mice , we observed that , compared to control group , it developed more liver metastases in CEMIP group , while less liver metastases in ZCL278 group . Importantly , liver metastases in CEMIP + ZCL278 group were signi ﬁ cantly less than in CEMIP group ( Fig . 6D and Supplementary Fig . S10D ) , indicating that CDC42 inhibitor suppressed CEMIP - mediated liver metastasis . Consistently , it showed less weight loss and better survival of mice in CEMIP + ZCL278 group compared with that in CEMIP group , indicating that CDC42 inhibitor alleviated CEMIP - mediated weight loss and prolonged survival of mice ( Fig . 6E , F ) . In addition , IHC assays showed that CEMIP decreased GRAF1 expression but up - regulated CDC42 / MAPK pathway , which was suppressed CDC42 inhibitor ( Supplementary Fig . S10E ) . In conclusion , CEMIP promotes metastasis of CRC cells through GRAF1 / CDC42 / MAPK pathway - regulated EMT . Fig . 2 CEMIP negatively regulates the stability of GRAF1 .

G . Xu et al . 5 Cell Death and Disease ( 2023 ) 14 : 167 DISCUSSION Metastasis is one of the main causes of death in patients with advanced colon cancer , and it is an obstacle in the clinical treatment . Our previous research proved that CEMIP function - ally promoted CRC metastasis and was closely related to poor outcomes . And CDC42 / MAPK pathway was proved to play a key role in the regulation of tumor growth , metastasis and drug resistance [ 28 , 32 , 33 ] . In the present study , we demonstrated that CEMIP promoted CRC metastasis through activating CDC42 / MAPK pathway by enhancing the degradation of GRAF1 , G . Xu et al . 6 Cell Death and Disease ( 2023 ) 14 : 167 and CDC42 inhibitor suppressed CEMIP - mediated CRC metastasis . Accumulating evidence showed that CEMIP was potential to serve as a therapeutic target for tumor metastasis . To further explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of CEMIP - mediated CRC metas - tasis , we identi ﬁ ed CEMIP interacting with GRAF1 , and CEMIP was negative correlated with GRAF1 in CRC . GRAF1 was reported to be a tumor suppressor that was genetically or functionally inactivated in several tumors , including gastric cancer , ovarian cancer , and metastatic brain cancer [ 19 – 22 ] . Interestingly , GRAF1 or CEMIP alone could not predict both of PFS and OS of CRC patients . However , we found that the combination of CEMIP and GRAF1 could effectively predict the survival of CRC patients . GRAF1 was comprised of a BAR domain , a PH domain , a RhoGAP domain , and a SH3 domain which was originally identi ﬁ ed binding to focal adhesion kinase [ 23 , 24 ] . Importantly , we elucidated that the domain ( 295 – 819aa sequence ) of CEMIP was indispensable for interacting with the SH3 domain of GRAF1 , which was essential to the ubiquitination and degradation of GRAF1 . As a whole , we demonstrated that CEMIP interacted with GRAF1 to negatively regulate the stability of GRAF1 . Although CEMIP promoted the ubiquitination level and degrada - tion of GRAF1 , CEMIP had no canonical catalytic structure of E3 ubiquitin ligase . Hence , we hypothesized that CEMIP regulated the stability of GRAF1 by relying on an E3 ubiquitin ligase . Then we identi ﬁ ed MIB1 as a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase of GRAF1 . MIB1 was reported as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of Notch ligands [ 34 ] , and played an important role in growth , metastasis , and micro - environment of tumor [ 35 – 37 ] . In the current research , we proved that MIB1 interacted with the RhoGAP domain of GRAF1 , and negatively regulated the ubiquitina - tion of GRAF1 , which supported that GRAF1 was a ubiquitinated substrate of MIB1 in CRC . It was reported that E3 ligases and their scaffold proteins could bind with numerous substrates via their multi - domain structures [ 34 ] . Interestingly , we uncovered that CEMIP interacted with MIB1 though the 820 – 1204aa domain , but not the 295 – 819aa domain which bound to GRAF1 , indicating that CEMIP could bind GRAF1 and MIB1 in the meantime . Moreover , CEMIP promoted the interaction of GRAF1 and MIB1 , which signi ﬁ cantly enhanced the ubiquitination of GRAF1 . Collectively , our results supported that CEMIP acted as a scaffold protein in bridging GRAF1 and MIB1 , which was critical to GRAF1 degradation . Previous studies indicated that GRAF1 , as a GTPase activating protein , inhibited the function of CDC42 through GTP hydrolysis via protein - protein interaction [ 38 , 39 ] . CDC42 was proved to regulate EMT and cancer metastasis [ 28 , 32 , 40 ] , and activate PAK1 ( a serine / threonine protein kinase ) which was involved in various tumor signaling pathways including MAPK [ 41 ] . In our research , we found that CEMIP down - regulated the expression level of GRAF1 , activated CDC42 / MAPK pathway - regulated EMT , thus promoted the metastasis of CRC cells . It suggested that CEMIP activates CDC42 / MAPK pathway - regulated EMT by enhancing the degradation of GRAF1 , which is indispensable to CEMIP - mediated migration and invasion of CRC cells . Importantly , we demonstrated that CDC42 inhibitor dramatically suppressed CEMIP - mediated CRC metastasis in vitro and in vivo . Altogether , our results revealed that CEMIP promoted CRC metastasis through GRAF1 / CDC42 / MAPK pathway - regulated EMT . In conclusion , we identi ﬁ ed CEMIP interacting with GRAF1 , and the combination of high - CEMIP and low - GRAF1 predicted poor survival of patients . Moreover , we uncovered that CEMIP acted as a scaffold protein in bridging MIB1 and GRAF1 , which was critical to GRAF1 degradation and CEMIP - mediated CRC metastasis . Furthermore , we found that CEMIP activated CDC42 / MAPK pathway - regulated EMT by enhancing the degradation of GRAF1 , which was indispensable to CEMIP - mediated migration and invasion of CRC cells . Importantly , we proved that CDC42 inhibitor suppressed CEMIP - mediated CRC metastasis in vitro and in vivo . Therefore , our research suggested that CDC42 inhibitor could be a novel therapeutic strategy for CEMIP - mediated CRC metastasis . METHODS AND MATERIALS Cell culture Human CRC cells ( HCT116 , SW480 ) and HEK293T cells were purchased from Cell Bank , Type Culture Collection , Chinese Academy of Sciences ( CBTCCCAS , Shanghai , China ) , and were cultured in DMEM or RPMI 1640 ( GIBCO , USA ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( BI , Israel ) , 100 U / mL penicillin and 100 μ g / mL streptomycin . All human cell lines have been authenticated using STR pro ﬁ ling within the last 3 years . All experiments were performed with mycoplasma - free cells . Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis For immunoprecipitation , cells were harvested and resuspended in NETN buffer ( 20 mM of Tris HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 100 mM of NaCl , 1 mM of EDTA , and 0 . 5 % NonidetP - 40 ) . Cell lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 13200 rpm at 4 °C . The supernatant was incubated with Pierce Protein G agarose beads ( Santa Cruz , USA ) which had been incubated with the primary antibody or IgG , shaking overnight at 4 °C . Then the precipitates were washed ﬁ ve times with NETN buffer and analyzed by NanoLC - Ultra 1D plus system mass spectrometer ( Eksigent , USA ) , and analyzed by the Chemiluminescent Western Blot Detection Kit ( Cat No . 32209 , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , USA ) . Transwell migration and invasion assays For transwell assays , cells ( 5 * 10 4 per well for migration , 10 * 10 4 per well for invasion ) were seeded in the upper well of the transwell chamber ( Corning , USA ) coated with or without Matrigel ( BD Bioscience , USA ) with serum - free medium and allowed to migrate or invade towards the medium containing 10 % FBS in the lower compartment for 24 h or 48 h .
