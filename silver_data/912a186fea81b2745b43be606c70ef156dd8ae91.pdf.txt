This article is published with open access Abstract Tamoxifen has been used for many years to target estrogen receptor signalling in breast cancer cells . Tamoxifen is also an agonist of the G protein - coupled estrogen receptor ( GPER ) , a GPCR ubiquitously expressed in tissues that mediates the acute response to estrogens . Here we report that tamoxifen promotes mechanical quiescence in hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) , stromal ﬁ broblast - like cells whose activation triggers and perpetuates liver ﬁ brosis in hepatocellular carcinomas . This mechanical deactivation is mediated by the GPER / RhoA / myosin axis and induces YAP deactivation . We report that tamoxifen decreases the levels of hypoxia - inducible factor - 1 alpha ( HIF - 1 α ) and the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins through a mechanical mechanism that involves actomyosin - dependent contractility and mechanosensing of tissue stiffness . Our results implicate GPER - mediated estrogen signalling in the mechanosensory - driven activation of HSCs and put forward estrogenic signalling as an option for mechanical reprogramming of myo ﬁ broblast - like cells in the tumour microenvironment . Tamoxifen , with half a century of safe clinical use , might lead this strategy of drug repositioning . Introduction The G protein - coupled estrogen receptor ( GPER ) is a seven transmembrane G protein - coupled receptor ( GPCR ) that mediates the acute response to extracellular estrogens [ 1 , 2 ] . Agonists for GPER include endogenous estrogens such as 17 β - estradiol , as well as synthetic compounds , such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant . Tamoxifen is a GPER agonist that has been used in clinics for more than 50 years as hormonal therapy for breast cancer based on the classical genomic estrogen receptor ( ER ) signalling pathway , unrelated to GPER . Interestingly , tamoxifen has also been used in women at risk of developing breast cancer and has been observed to reduce mammographic density and ﬁ brosis [ 3 , 4 ] . Due to its established pharmacology and non - toxicity , tamoxifen is well positioned to lead our efforts in exploring novel modes of action for this drug and investigating the possible clinical bene ﬁ ts of GPER - mediated estrogen signalling . Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the most common form of primary liver cancer and , regardless of aetiology , occurs predominantly in patients with cirrhosis , which is characterised by excessive extracellular matrix ( ECM ) deposition that presents the ideal environment for promot - ing tumour formation . In this environment , hepatocyte necrosis , in ﬂ ammation , oxidative stress and hypoxia are responsible for genetic alterations and deregulation of sig - nalling pathways that promote HCC development [ 5 – 7 ] . It is also known that in ﬂ ammation in the stroma in HCC can be modulated by estrogens [ 8 ] .

HSCs , like other myo ﬁ broblast - like cells [ 12 ] , are highly responsive to mechanical cues , requiring a stiff microenvironment to become activated and therefore initiate and perpetuate ﬁ brosis . They achieve this by ( i ) activating their contractile apparatus to apply endogenous forces to the ECM , and ( ii ) mechanosensing the rigidity from their surroundings [ 13 , 14 ] . Both processes , cell contractility and mechanosensing , rely on activation of the small GTPase RhoA [ 15 , 16 ] . RhoA is essential in maintaining the activated phenotype of HSCs , by ensuring cell contractility through regulation of ROCK and other modulators of actomyosin [ 17 ] . Here we report that tamoxifen induces the mechanical deactivation of HSCs via a previously unidenti ﬁ ed mechanism that involves the GPER / RhoA / myosin axis . This inhibits activation of YAP ( Yes - associated protein ) and durotaxis in HSCs . We also show that cell contractility and ECM rigidity regulate the levels of hypoxia - inducible factor 1 alpha ( HIF - 1 α ) and lysyl oxidase ( LOX ) in HSCs , and that tamoxifen suppresses force - mediated regulation of both HIF - 1 α and LOX . HIF - 1 α is fundamental for cell survival in hypoxic conditions [ 18 ] , as the LOX family regulates collagen crosslinking and ECM architecture and is therefore required for hypoxia - induced metastasis . Results Tamoxifen treatment reduces myosin activation in HSCs via GPER / RhoA signalling Actomyosin contractility is a key characteristic of activated HSCs , allowing mechanotransduction and force generation . This behaviour is adaptive in wound healing but promotes ﬁ brosis in HCC [ 11 ] . Regulation of actomyosin contractility is achieved through phosphorylation of the regulatory pro - tein myosin light chain 2 ( MLC - 2 ) . Tamoxifen is a 17 β - estradiol mimetic that activates GPER , and has been well characterised in its ability to selectively modulate estrogen receptors [ 19 ] . We used immuno ﬂ uorescence staining to con ﬁ rm the presence of GPER and the canonical estrogen receptors alpha and beta ( ER - α and ER - β ) in HSCs ( Sup - plementary Fig S1 ) . We also con ﬁ rmed the levels of expression of GPER in HSCs using immunoblotting / immuno ﬂ uorescence and GPER knockdown / over - expression ( Supplementary Fig S2 - S4 ) . To assess acto - myosin contractility , we determined the levels of active phosphorylated MLC - 2 ( pMLC - 2 ) , as well as the total MLC - 2 , in response to 10 - day treatment with tamoxifen . We also included conditions with antagonists against ER and GPER to explore which receptor tamoxifen acted through . We used the selective ER antagonist ( ICI182780 ) [ 20 ] and the speci ﬁ c GPER antagonist G15 [ 21 ] . For this experiment and the subsequent ones , ICI182780 and G15 were used simultaneously with tamoxifen treatment . Across all four conditions ( control , tamoxifen , tamoxifen + ER antagonist , tamoxifen + GPER antagonist ) , the stain - ing intensity for MLC - 2 remained constant , indicating that protein expression was unchanged following treatment ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Levels of pMLC - 2 were signi ﬁ cantly reduced in the tamoxifen and tamoxifen + ER antagonist conditions com - pared to control , indicating that tamoxifen greatly reduces MLC - 2 phosphorylation , but does not act through the nuclear estrogen receptors . Conversely , tamoxifen + GPER antagonist showed pMLC - 2 staining intensity comparable to the control condition , suggesting that tamoxifen achieves inhibition of MLC - 2 activation through GPER ( Fig . 1a , b ) . To further con ﬁ rm the speci ﬁ c role of GPER , we per - formed experiments with siRNA to knockdown GPER expression , in combination with tamoxifen or the estrogen 17 β - estradiol ( E2 ) . Treatment was performed for 72 h since GPER knockdown with siRNA is only stable for this amount of time . We observed that 72 - h treatment of HSCs with either tamoxifen or E2 led to a decrease in pMLC - 2 without affecting MLC - 2 abundance , similar to 10 - day tamoxifen treatment . Knockdown of GPER with siRNA GPER showed abundance of pMLC - 2 comparable to the control condition , even in the presence of tamoxifen or E2 ( Supplementary Fig S5 ) . This demonstrates that estrogenic signalling , instigated by either tamoxifen or E2 , acts through GPER to reduce MLC - 2 phosphorylation . Like - wise , we assessed the effect of tamoxifen on the activation of MLC - 2 after 24 - h treatment and observed that while the total levels of MLC - 2 were kept constant , pMLC - 2 were signi ﬁ cantly decreased in the tamoxifen group and this effect was mediated by GPER ( Supplementary Fig S6 ) . RhoA lies upstream of MLC - 2 and controls MLC - 2 activation [ 22 ] . We quanti ﬁ ed the levels of total RhoA and active RhoA levels in HSCs under tamoxifen treatment . Both control and 10 day tamoxifen treated conditions showed similar levels of total RhoA . Control cells exhibited active RhoA levels of around 50 % of total RhoA , sig - ni ﬁ cantly higher than in the tamoxifen treated cells where active RhoA levels were around 20 % ( Fig . 1c ) . Taken together , these data suggest that tamoxifen reduces myosin activation via the GPER / RhoA / MLC - 2 axis . GPER activation in HSCs impairs force generation and increases cell compliance To further assess the effects of tamoxifen on cell con - tractility , we used elastic pillars as a form of traction force microscopy . This technique assesses the individual force Tamoxifen mechanically deactivates hepatic stellate cells via the G protein - coupled estrogen receptor 2911 applied to ﬁ bronectin - coated polydimethylsiloxane pillars during cell spreading . Using the de ﬂ ection of each pillar in contact with the cell and the known Young ’ s modulus of each pillar in the array , quantitative analysis of force gen - eration was achieved . We report the value of mean max - imum force , calculated from the mean value of the maximum force experienced by each pillar with cellular contact during the time of analysis . Control HSCs generated a mean maximum force of around 3 . 2 nN , and following 10 - day tamoxifen treatment , this mean maximum force was signi ﬁ cantly reduced to around 1 . 2 nN . When a GPER antagonist was present alongside tamoxifen , the mean maximum force returned to a value comparable to control and signi ﬁ cantly higher than tamoxifen alone ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Both 72 - h tamoxifen treatment and E2 treatment also sig - ni ﬁ cantly reduced traction forces in HSCs , but force gen - eration was rescued in the presence of siRNA against GPER . Additionally , G1 , a speci ﬁ cally designed GPER agonist [ 23 ] , reduced traction forces , but did not with GPER knockdown ( Supplementary Fig S7 ) . These results indicate that GPER regulates cell traction forces , with tamoxifen , E2 and G1 all acting as GPER agonists . The ability of cells to generate force is also dependent on their rheological properties such as cell stiffness [ 24 , 25 ] . Drugs that disrupt the cytoskeleton are known to inhibit the activated phenotype of HSCs [ 26 ] and these types of drugs have also been shown to decrease cell stiffness [ 27 ] . We used atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) indentation of HSCs seeded on ﬁ bronectin - coated ﬂ uorodishes to determine cell elasticity . By indenting the cells at points between the nucleus and the cell edge , we ensured that our analysis would accurately assess the contribution of the cytoskeleton to cell elasticity , and would be unaffected by the nucleus or the underlying substrate . We observed that control HSCs had a Young ’ s modulus around 4 . 1 kPa , and this was signi ﬁ cantly reduced to around 1 . 7 kPa with 10 - day tamoxifen treatment .

GPER activation reduces HSC mechanosensing and YAP activation We used magnetic tweezers microrheology to assess the ability of HSCs to respond to external mechanical forces , as would be experienced surrounded by a rigid stroma . Fibronectin - coated magnetic beads were attached to cells , and 12 consecutive pulses of equal force were applied with magnetic tweezers . Cells that displayed mechanosensitivity showed a reduction in bead displacement as the cytoskele - ton reinforced following force application ( Fig . 3a ) . We observed that control HSCs showed mechan - osensitivity , signi ﬁ cantly reducing the displacement of the bead on the 12th pulse to 71 % of the displacement measured on the 1st pulse . With 10 day tamoxifen treat - ment , the 12th pulse had 85 % of the displacement measured on the 1st pulse , a value not signi ﬁ cantly different from its ﬁ rst pulse displacement , indicating a reduction in mechan - otransduction . Using the GPER antagonist G15 , mechan - otransduction was restored to control levels , with the 12th pulse at 68 % compared to the 1st pulse ( Fig . 3b ) . The transcriptional regulator YAP is a key cellular mechanotransducer , converting external mechanical signals into changes in gene expression through its translocation to the nucleus [ 28 ] . YAP has further been shown to be essential in the mechanosensitive phenomenon of durotaxis in HSCs [ 29 ] . We stained control and 10 - day tamoxifen - treated HSCs for YAP and assessed the intensity of staining in both the nucleus and cytoplasm . The ratio between these intensity values represents the level of YAP translocation to the nucleus and therefore activation . Control HSCs showed increased YAP nuclear localisation compared to 10 - day tamoxifen - treated HSCs , suggesting that tamoxifen reduces levels of YAP mediated mechanotransduction ( Fig . 3c , d ) .

Three experimental replicates in all panels Tamoxifen mechanically deactivates hepatic stellate cells via the G protein - coupled estrogen receptor 2913 Seventy - two - hour treatment of HSCs with either tamoxifen or E2 also led to decreased YAP nuclear localisation , with GPER knockdown rescuing localisation to that of control HSCs ( Supplementary Fig S8 ) , indicating the speci ﬁ c role of GPER in estrogen - mediated YAP deactivation . The expression of the downstream YAP target genes CTGF and ANKRD1 were reduced in 10 day tamoxifen treated HSCs , in concurrence with the immuno ﬂ uorescence data ( Fig . 3e ) . We then performed correlation analysis for the expression pro ﬁ les of the genes GPER , YAP and CTGF using the TCGA ( Cancer Genome Atlas ) database , and found that GPER expression in HCC patients negatively correlates with the expression of YAP and CTGF ( Fig . 3f ) . Tamoxifen treatment induces HSC deactivation Force generation and mechanotransduction are the two pillars required for maintenance of the activated phenotype of HSCs , similar to other myo ﬁ broblast - like cells [ 13 , 30 ] . Since we observed tamoxifen to inhibit these mechanical properties , we assessed whether tamoxifen could promote HSC deactivation . We used immuno ﬂ uorescence and qPCR to assess levels of α - SMA and vimentin , both markers of the activated phenotype . We observed a signi ﬁ cant decrease in both α - SMA and vimentin with tamoxifen treatment at both the protein ( Supplementary Fig S9 ) and mRNA ( Supple - mentary Fig S10 ) levels . With GPER knocked down with siRNA for 72 h , we observed no effect of tamoxifen in reducing the levels of both markers of quiescence in HSCs ( α - SMA and vimentin ) , though 72 h treatment by tamoxifen did decrease these levels . Likewise , treating HSCs with 17 β - estradiol also downregulated the expression of α - SMA and vimentin to levels comparable to those observed in the tamoxifen group ( Supplementary Fig S9 ) . These results support the notion that tamoxifen promotes mechanical deactivation in HSCs through GPER / RhoA signalling . l o r t no C T a m Control Tam 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 * * * YAP staining m sa l po t y C / r ae l c u N ) . u . a ( l o r t no c o t ev i t a l e r YAP YAP Nuclei 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 1st pulse 12th pulse n . s . * * * * Control Tam Tam + GPER ant t n e m eca l p s i D ev i t a l e R CTGF ANKRD1 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 Control Tam * * * * * * mRNA expression ) . u . a ( e gn a h c d l oF a b c d 1 st pulse 12 th pulse f o e du t il p m A no i t a lli cs o d ae b 10 s 100 n m e f Control Tam CTGF ANKRD1 - 0 . 2 - 0 . 1 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 GPER YAP CTGF 0 . 03 0 . 03 mRNA expression se n e G Fig . 3 Tamoxifen treatment suppresses mechanosensing and YAP activation in HSCs . a Representative trace that shows the decrease in the amplitude of oscillation of a bead attached to a cell that can sense external mechanical stimuli ( mechanosensing ) . b Histogram shows relative bead displacement for the ﬁ rst and last pulse , n = 25 cells ( control ) , 20 cells ( tam ) and 21 cells ( tam and GPER antagonist ) . c Representative images for immuno ﬂ uorescence staining of HSCs , scale bar 20 µm .

Tamoxifen treatment suppresses ECM protein production A key role of activated HSCs in promoting further ﬁ brosis and disease development is their ability to produce high levels of ECM proteins for secretion into their micro - environment . Collagen - I and ﬁ bronectin are abundant pro - teins within the ECM , playing critical roles in the organisation and structural integrity of the environment , and when overexpressed , can contribute to a pro - tumour microenvironment [ 31 ] . We used immuno ﬂ uorescence to determine both the intracellular expression , and the extra - cellular secretion , of both collagen - I and ﬁ bronectin . We observed that 10 - day tamoxifen treatment signi ﬁ cantly reduced the intracellular and extracellular levels of both collagen - I ( Fig . 4a , b , e ) and ﬁ bronectin ( Fig . 4c , d , f ) . 72 - h tamoxifen treatment also reduced intracellular collagen - I and ﬁ bronectin levels , but could be rescued with GPER knockdown . E2 treatment for 72 - h also showed the same trend ( Supplementary Figure S11 ) . Due to the highly contractile phenotype of activated HSCs , and their role in ECM protein production , we assessed how enhancing contractile ability in ﬂ uenced collagen - I and ﬁ bronectin expression . We transfected con - trol HSCs with constitutively active myosin - 2 ( pMLC - 2 ) to increase cell contractility , and we observed signi ﬁ cant increases in expression of both collagen - I and ﬁ bronectin ( Fig . 4g ) , suggesting a mechanical basis to transcriptional regulation of both ECM proteins by HSCs . We also assessed how changes in matrix rigidity , achieved through fabrication of different rigidity poly - acrylamide ( PAA ) gels for cell culture , could change the production of collagen - I and ﬁ bronectin . A 1 kPa gel , which approximates the rigidity of healthy liver [ 32 ] , was used as a soft substrate and we observed that increasing this rigidity to 25 kPa gave signi ﬁ cant increases in collagen - I and ﬁ bronectin mRNAs . We further observed that 10 - day tamoxifen treated HSCs on 25 kPa gels showed mRNA levels of collagen - I and ﬁ bronectin comparable to the 1 kPa condition , i . e . signi ﬁ cantly lower than the 25 kPa condition ( Fig . 4h ) . This indicates that tamoxifen inhibits the mechanical signalling pathway that connects external rigidity and increased ECM deposition . Collectively these results show that increased contractility and ECM stiffness trigger a transcriptional increase in both collagen - I and ﬁ bronectin in HSCs , and that tamoxifen inhibits this force - mediated activation . Tamoxifen treatment mechanically inhibits the HIF - 1 α / LOX and HIF - 1 α / LOX - L2 axes Liver ﬁ brosis in HCC , along with excess consumption of oxygen by hepatocytes , leads to tissue hypoxia , and the survival of cells becomes dependent on expression of HIF - 1 α [ 33 ] . Hypoxia , through HIF - 1 α , can regulate expression of ECM protein genes , such as ﬁ bronectin [ 34 ] and collagen - I [ 35 ] . HIF - 1 α has many other downstream targets , including members of the lysyl oxidase ( LOX ) family . Lysyl oxidases are copper - dependent enzymes that have fundamental roles in ECM organization in cancer . For instance , LOX is essential in hypoxia driven metastasis [ 36 ] and LOX - L2 is involved in ECM remodelling in ﬁ brosis [ 37 ] . Mechanical induction of HIF - 1 α has also been observed in endothelial cells exposed to low shear stress [ 38 ] , and in the myocardium in response to mechanical stress [ 39 ] . While hypoxia is the most common method of HIF - 1 α activation , upregulation of HIF - 1 α expression has also been seen in the presence of oxygen , with GPCRs on the cell surface responding to microenvironmental cues [ 40 ] . We observed that levels of HIF - 1 α are reduced in HSCs following 10 - day tamoxifen treatment ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Fur - thermore , levels of LOX and LOX - L2 are also reduced with tamoxifen ( Fig . 5c – f ) , suggesting that the ability of HSCs to cross - link collagen ﬁ bres in the ECM may be affected by tamoxifen treatment . Similarly , 72 - h treatment by tamoxifen or E2 reduced levels of HIF - 1 α , LOX and LOX - L2 , but no reduction was seen with GPER knockdown ( Supplementary Figure S12 ) . Notably , we observed that the levels of HIF - 1 α , LOX and LOX - L2 are responsive to mechanical cues indepen - dent of tamoxifen - mediated signalling . The mRNA expression of these proteins is increased following trans - fection of HSCs with active myosin - 2 ( Fig . 5g ) . Similarly , the culturing of HSCs on polyacrylamide gels of differing rigidities also affected mRNA production . Compared to a 1 kPa substrate , HSCs cultured on a 25 kPa substrate showed a signi ﬁ cantly increased expression of HIF - 1 α , LOX and LOX - L2 ( Fig . 5h ) . This suggests that mechanotransduction alone can drive processes that promote survival under hypoxic conditions . When tamoxifen was added to HSCs cultured on the stiff 25 kPa substrate for 10 days , levels of HIF - 1 α , LOX and LOX - L2 were reduced , becoming equivalent to the levels of these species on the soft 1 kPa substrate . To gain mechanistic insight into tamoxifen - induced downregulation of LOX , LOX - L2 and ﬁ bronectin , we used HIF - 1 α siRNA to knock - down HIF - 1 α expression . We observed that the mRNA levels of LOX , LOX - L2 and ﬁ bronectin , when treated with HIF - 1 α siRNA , were equivalent to the mRNA levels seen with tamoxifen treatment ( Fig . 5i and Supplementary Fig S13 ) . When taken together these results suggest that tamoxifen decreases LOX , LOX - L2 and ﬁ bronectin expression via HIF - 1 α , and that the effect of tamoxifen on HIF - 1 α levels is mechanically regulated by reducing myosin - 2 dependent HSCs contractility and tissue stiffness . Tamoxifen mechanically deactivates hepatic stellate cells via the G protein - coupled estrogen receptor 2915 Tamoxifen impairs directed migration via GPER signalling HSCs have been observed to migrate up a stiffness gradient , a process also known as durotaxis and this has been suggested to be a further step in the perpetuation of ﬁ brosis in the liver [ 29 ] . Since this pro - cess was shown to be highly dependent on mechan - otransduction , and our results here have shown tamoxifen to inhibit mechanotransduction through GPER , we investigated the ability of tamoxifen to inhibit HSC durotaxis .

We prepared PAA gels of dual rigidity to assess HSC durotaxis in vitro following a protocol previously described [ 29 ] . On these gels , control HSCs moved an average dis - tance in the X - axis ( up the stiffness gradient ) of around 70 µm over 5 ½ h , with an average speed of 0 . 99 µm / min along their individual paths . Ten - day tamoxifen treated cells and tamoxifen combined with an ER antagonist treated cells both showed no durotaxis , with signi ﬁ cantly reduced cell movement speeds of 0 . 20 µm / min and 0 . 15 µm / min , respectively . When tamoxifen was combined with a GPER antagonist , durotaxis was rescued ( average distance in X - axis = 61 µm over 5 ½ h ) and cell speed became similar to the control condition ( 0 . 98 µm / min ) ( Fig . 6 and videos 1 – 4 ) . Seventy - two - hour treatment of HSCs with tamoxifen or G1 also abrogated durotaxis behaviour , though GPER knock - down was able to rescue the tamoxifen treated cells , with C on t r o l T a m a LOX HIF - 1a LOX LOX - L2 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 1 kPa 25 kPa 25 kPa + Tam * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * mRNA expression Fo l d c h a ng e ( a . u . ) HIF - 1a Merged Merged LOX - L2 Merged C on t r o l T a m c C on t r o l T a m e HIF - 1a 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 ControlTam * * * M F I ( a . u . ) LOX 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 ControlTam * * * M F I ( a . u . ) LOX - L2 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 ControlTam * * * M F I ( a . u . ) b d f g LOX LOX - L2 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 ControlTamHIF - 1a siRNA n . s . n . s . * * * * * * mRNA expression Fo l d c h a ng e ( a . u . ) HIF - 1a LOX LOX - L2 0 1 2 3 4 5 ControlActive myosin * * * * * * * * mRNA expression Fo l d c h a ng e ( a . u . ) h i Actin / nuclei Actin / nuclei Actin / nuclei HIF - 1a LOX LOX - L2 HIF - 1a LOX LOX - L2 LOX LOX - L2 HIF - 1a Fig . 5 Tamoxifen treatment mechanically inhibits the HIF - 1A / LOX and HIF - 1A / LOX - L2 axes . a , c and e Representative images for immuno ﬂ uorescence staining of HSCs . b , d , f Quanti ﬁ cation of immuno ﬂ uorescence staining for ( a , c and e ) .

These combined results show that tamoxifen inhibits the ability of HSCs to migrate to stiffer substrates via GPER signalling . Discussion Estrogens regulate a manifold of physiological and patho - logical processes and although endogenous estrogen is mainly derived from the ovaries in premenopausal women and mostly regarded as a female hormone [ 41 ] , estrogen is also produced in other tissues , such as adipose tissues and arteries in both men and women [ 19 , 42 ] . Until recently , the ﬁ eld of estrogens was dominated by studies that explored their transcriptional effects via nuclear estrogen receptors . However , the last decade has witnessed an explosion of interest in GPER - mediated estrogen signalling . From our results , GPER comes to light as a compre - hensive and effective mechanoregulator that targets the activation of fundamental proteins in cell mechanics , such as RhoA [ 22 , 43 ] and MLC - 2 to control force generation , mechanosensing and durotaxis in hepatic stellate cells . Increased levels of MLC - 2 are required for the ability of stromal cells to remodel the ECM [ 44 ] to perpetuate ﬁ brosis [ 45 ] . Likewise , high levels of active YAP , a mechan - oresponsive transcriptional regulator [ 28 ] , are indispensable for the activation of tumour - associated myo ﬁ broblasts in the stroma [ 46 ] , and we show that YAP is downregulated in tamoxifen treated HSCs . Due to the similarity of activated HSCs to myo ﬁ broblasts , we posit that GPER is therefore likely to in ﬂ uence the mechanical properties of other stro - mal cells ( Fig . 7 ) . The activation of HIF - 1 α is required for cell survival under hypoxic conditions . The dense stroma that surrounds solid tumours limits the accessibility of nutrients and C on t r o l T a m T a m + E R a n t a gon i s t T a m + G PE R a n t a gon i s t - 20 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Rigidity gradient * * * n . s . n . s .

Cortes et al . oxygen to cells , promoting HIF - 1 α stabilisation [ 47 ] . The rapid growth of cancer cells within HCC also leads to high consumption of oxygen , further generating a hypoxic environment [ 48 ] . Our data suggest that HIF - 1 α is the unifying factor through which tamoxifen subsequently reduces the levels of LOX , LOX - L2 and ﬁ bronectin in HSCs . We suggest that HIF - 1 α may act as a converging point to mechanically regulate the adaptive response of HCC to hypoxia and the overall architecture of the tumour microenvironment . We propose that this mechanical reg - ulation of HIF - 1 α by tamoxifen in an oxygen - independent manner may result in an effective reduction of cell ﬁ tness to cope with hypoxic condition in HSCs , and potentially in cancer cells as well , leading to decreasing ﬁ brosis . Development of ﬁ brosis relies on positive feedback pathways , including mechanotransduction and ECM protein deposition [ 49 ] and durotaxis [ 29 ] . The directed migration of cells to stiffer ﬁ brotic areas leads to further activation by mechanotransduction , leading to an increase in ECM pro - tein production , which in turn , promotes a stiffer micro - environment [ 13 ] that might lead to increased chemoresistance in cancer cells [ 50 ] . Durotaxis can also play a role in facilitating cross - talk between cancer cells and activated stromal cells such as activated HSCs [ 51 ] , and therefore the inhibition of directed migration by tamoxifen , combined with its ability to induce HSC quiescence , indi - cates the multiple ways in which tamoxifen could mechanically in ﬂ uence the tumor - stroma cross - talk . Within the liver tissue , HSCs reside within the ECM , a mixture of scaffolding proteins secreted by HSCs , among other stromal cells . Interactions between cells are mostly through paracrine signalling , as well as interactions with the ECM proteins , rather than direct cell - cell interactions [ 9 ] . For our in vitro studies , we used culture - activated HSCs seeded on ﬁ bronectin - coated glass , a widely employed model , which recapitulates the activated phenotype in vivo with good approximation [ 10 ] . However , the behaviour we observe in vitro may well differ from that in vivo , where HSCs are in ﬂ uenced by factors secreted by cancer cells and other stromal cells , as well as the complex architecture of the ECM [ 9 ] , which are not present in our in vitro setup . Further studies with HSCs are therefore necessary for a full comprehension of the role of GPER in vivo . Our work lays the foundations for further studies that could directly in ﬂ uence therapeutic development . Tamox - ifen is a widely used drug in clinics , with well - established pharmacodynamics [ 52 ] and safety [ 53 ] , and due to the pleiotropic effects of estrogens and the commonality of GPCR signaling pathways , it is possible that tamoxifen regulates many genes involved in the function of myo ﬁ broblast - like cells such as activated HSCs or cancer associated ﬁ broblasts . This could lead to development of stromal reprogramming strategies in which GPER agonists could modulate the ﬁ brovascular stroma of HCC to increase vascular density and perfusion by reducing overall solid stress , achieved through inhibiting expression of collagen and ﬁ bronectin . This would increase intratumoral drug perfusion , while concurrently impeding the adaptive ﬁ tness of tumour and stromal cells to survive under hypoxic con - ditions ( via HIF - 1 α ) and thus promote widespread hypoxic necrosis . Materials and methods Cell culture and antibodies Primary , culture - activated human hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) , passage 3 – 6 , ( HHStec 5300 ; ScienCell , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) were cultured in phenol red medium ( DMEM - F12 HAM , cat . D6434 , Sigma – Aldrich ) supplemented with 10 % foetal bovine serum ( cat . 10500 – 064 , Gibco ) , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( P4333 , Sigma – Aldrich , USA ) and 1 % Fungizone R amphotericin ( 15290 – 026 , Gibco ) . These cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination . Tamoxifen ( Z - 4 - hydroxytamoxifen , cat . H7904 Sigma – Aldrich , USA ) and 17 β - Estradiol ( E2 ) ( catalog number E8875 , Sigma – Aldrich , USA ) were prepared in ethanol ( stock solution 100 μ M ) . The speci ﬁ c ER antagonist ( ICI182780 ) [ 20 ] , GPER antagonist ( G15 ) [ 21 ] and speci ﬁ cally designed GPER agonist [ 23 ] were purchased from Tocris ( cat . 1047 , 3678 and 3577 , respectively ) . ICI182780 , G1 and G15 were prepared in DMSO ( stock solution 50 mM ) . To prevent any estrogenic effects from phenol red , during the treatment with tamoxifen , E2 or G1 , HSCs were transferred to clear medium with no phenol red ( DMEM - F12 HAM , cat .

Tamoxifen activates GPER and this downregulates the activity of RhoA , which in consequence decreases the levels of pMLC - 2 ( active form ) . The decrease in MLC - 2 activation leads to suppressing mechanosensing , force generation and HSCs ability to mechanically regulate the synthesis of ECM proteins and HIF - 1alpha Tamoxifen mechanically deactivates hepatic stellate cells via the G protein - coupled estrogen receptor 2919 D8437 , Sigma – Aldrich , USA ) supplemented with 10 % double charcoal stripped foetal calf serum — DCSS ( cat . 02 - 46 - 850 , First Link , Wolverhampton , UK ) , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( P4333 , Sigma Aldrich , USA ) and 1 % Fun - gizone R Amphotericin ( 15290 - 026 , Gibco , USA ) . For subsequent experiments media ( without phenol red ) and DCSS were used . In all experiments tamoxifen was used at 5 µM and E2 at 0 . 1 µM . GPER agonist G1 was used at 1 µM . ER and GPER antagonists ( ICI182780 and G15 ) were added simultaneously with tamoxifen in all experi - ments ; the concentration used for both was 1 µM . This range of concentrations have been used effectively in pre - vious studies [ 54 ] . Tamoxifen treatment was done for 72 h or 10 days . E2 and G1 treatments were conducted for 72 h . Media was replenished every 72 h in all cases . For GPER and HIF - 1 α knockdowns , siRNA for GPER ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , cat . sc - 60743 ) and siRNA for HIF - 1A ( cat . Sc - 35561 , from Santa Cruz Biotechnology USA ) , respec - tively , were used to transfect HSCs before the speci ﬁ c treatment . Human plasma ﬁ bronectin ( FC010 ) was from Millipore USA .

The GPER plasmid used to overexpress GPER was obtained from Sino Biological , UK ( catalog number HG11264 - ACG ) , and a stop codon was inserted between the GPER and GFP sequences by site directed mutagenesis . pEGFP - MRLC1 ( constitutively active MLC - 2 ) was a gift from Tom Egelhoff , Addgene USA plasmid # 35680 . Immuno ﬂ uorescence staining Cell immuno ﬂ uorescence staining was done on coverslips coated with 10 μ g ml − 1 ﬁ bronectin ( Gibco , phe0023 ) . Fol - lowing pertinent treatment cells were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraf - ormaldehyde ( Sigma , P6148 ) in D - PBS ( Sigma , D8537 ) for 10 min , and then blocked and permeabilized with 0 . 2 % BSA – 0 . 1 % Triton ( Sigma , T8787 ) in PBS for 30 min . After blocking , cells were incubated with primary antibodies prepared in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature in a humidi ﬁ ed chamber . Then , cells were washed in D - PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated secondary antibodies and Phalloidin ( Invitrogen , A22283 , 1 / 1 , 000 dilution ) prepared in PBS for 30 min at room temperature . Finally , coverslips were washed in PBS and mounted in mounting reagent with 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( Invitrogen , P36931 ) .
