The risk of human exposure demands an early 28 evaluation of both the basic dynamics of NPs ' interaction with biological systems and their 29 potential consequences . Deciphering these occurrences will provide critical information 30 regarding the health hazards and safety advantages associated with next - generation 31 nanoformulations in clinical practice . We examined the HepG2 cell line in a systematic manner 32 to determine the cellular response to single - walled carbon nanotubes ( SWCNTs ) and zinc oxide 33 ( ZnO ) NPs . With the use of high - throughput transcriptomic methods , we found that both NPs 34 induce comparable dysregulation of the endocytic and proteasomal complex genes in liver 35 hepatocellular carcinoma cells , at levels ( > 80 percent cell viability ) that do not cause over - 36 toxicity at early incubation period ( 6 h ) . SWCNT and ZnO NPs were shown to enter cells 37 through clathrin - mediated pathways , affecting cytoskeleton gene expression , DNA damage 38 and repair , protein ubiquitination , and cell transcriptional machinery . Our findings indicate that 39 early response strategies activate stress - related mechanisms . Finally , this method for studying 40 nanomaterial – cell interactions demonstrates how changes in the transcriptome profile may 41 predict downstream consequences even at doses that do not cause acute toxicity . 42 43 Keywords : Zinc Oxide ; Nanoparticles ; Single - Walled Carbon Nanotubes ; Transcriptomics ; 44 Toxicity ; Reactive oxygen species 45 46 1 . Introduction 47 The recent world urbanisation leads to the excess use of nanotechnology , albeit of their 48 tremendous implication at the industrial level ; still , the mechanism of their action is poorly 49 understood . Nanoparticles ( NPs ) are distinguished by their diverse physical and chemical 50 3 characteristics , which include a wide range of sizes , morphologies , surface area , and surface 51 activity . Two important classes of NPs : Metal oxide ( ZnO ) and carbon - based high aspect ratio 52 materials ( SWCNT ) , are produced with the highest global levels and utilised in a wide variety 53 of applications . The presence of mystical structural properties in multi - walled carbon 54 nanotubes ( MWCNT ) and single - walled carbon nanotubes ( SWCNT ) make them novel and 55 attractive candidates to be used as chemical sensors ( Meyyapan , 2016 ; Ali et al . , 2021 ) , 56 superconductors ( Futaba et al . , 2006 ) , a delivery vehicle for drugs , biomedical ( Rafeeqi and 57 Kaul , 2010 ) and agricultural ( Patel et al . , 2020 ) applications . Similarly , ZnO NPs have been 58 utilised in various consumer products such as sunscreens for their excellent UV absorbing 59 capacity ( Mohammed et al . , 2019 ) , food packaging due to their great antimicrobial activity 60 ( Siddiqi et al . , 2018 ) and as a potent antiviral agent ( Mittal and Ali , 2022 ) . It has also been 61 realised to have growth - promoting and disease - preventing effects on various plants such as 62 tomatoes and eggplants ( Mittal et al . , 2020 ; Elmer et al . , 2016 ) . The ever increasing commercial 63 application and extensive utilisation of engineered NPs prompted the scientific community to 64 identify potential impacts , including their toxicological property on human health and the 65 environment . 66 67 The continuously evolving literature using in vitro and in vivo testing models revealed that NPs 68 are responsible for generating reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , toxic ions shredding , lipid 69 peroxidation , and genotoxicity . For instance , ZnO NPs are observed to be harmful to both in 70 vitro ( MRC - 5 cell line ) and in vivo ( Drosophila ) models , resulting in a significant increase in 71 oxidative stress , decreased cellular viability genotoxicity and impairment of egg - to - adult 72 viability ( Ng et al . , 2017 ) . Also , SWCNT treated MRC - 5 cells has shown a reduction in cell 73 viability , significantly increased apoptosis and necrosis ( Ong et al . , 2017 ) . In this context , the 74 primary question arises whether this toxicological behaviour is based on the type of NPs or 75 4 because of common characteristics shared by diverse NPs . On this confusion , the previously 76 provided information regarding the safety aspects of these complex NPs are not acceptable and 77 utilising the already established protocols may give misleading results . Furthermore , the recent 78 report showed that the conventional assays used for the toxicity testing of drugs and soluble 79 chemicals are not perfect for NPs because they tend to interfere with the components of these 80 assays ( Guadagini et al . , 2015 ) . 81 82 Furthermore , cytotoxicity analysis by conventional techniques does not provide the overall 83 effect induced by NPs at the nano - bio interface . However , the detailed animal - based studies 84 could not be applied to many NPs for their safety assessment . Instead , they are costly , labour 85 intensive , and cannot be used as the primary screening platform . Therefore , new and highly 86 robust testing strategies are urgently required to provide innumerable interactions of NPs with 87 the biological system ( Nel et al . , 2013 ) . Thus a great deal of effort must be put forth to identify 88 the specific biomarker using high - throughput " omics " based technology . It also helps to 89 uncover the potential mechanism induced by the NPs stress in the biological system . In this 90 way , transcriptomic profiling is a powerful tool that can be utilised to evaluate the biological 91 interaction for gene expression perturbations ( Fröhlich et al . , 2017 ) . Furthermore , the 92 previously used " omics " based microarray technique is confined to a limited pre - prescribed set 93 of genes , unlike next - generation sequencing ( NGS ) that can directly sequence millions of 94 transcripts without any pre - conceived idea of the genes and genome . Hence , it provides new 95 avenues towards probing many pathways and molecular responses altogether ( Carrow et al . , 96 2018 ; Sun et al . , 2017 ; Lucafò et al . , 2013 ) . Recently our lab has performed proteomics analysis 97 that demonstrated dysregulation of proteins related to cytoskeleton alteration and thus affects 98 cellular morphology by the effect of ZnO NPs , MWCNT and MSN ( mesoporous silica 99 nanoparticles ) ( Yadav et al . , 2021 ) . Thus this study provides enough support to move further 100 5 with the omics analysis as a basis to uncover the cell - NPs interaction at a molecular level . 101 Additionally our another study was based on the transcriptomic analysis for the effect of MCN 102 ( Mesoporous carbon nanoparticles ) and MSN in liver hepatoma cells that describes the 103 regulation of common molecular pathways during initial interaction with the cellular system . 104 These NPs perturbed pathways including DNA damage , repair , cell cycle regulation , 105 transcription and ubiquitination are common among both MCN and MSN ( Mittal et al . , 2022 ) . 106 107 Previously , safety assessment studies that have been focussed using NGS mostly rely on the 108 high dose exposure conditions that do not depict the realistic scenario . Recent efforts has been 109 put forward to start assessing the toxicological effect of NPs considering the doses at which 110 humans could be exposed in real life conditions ( Kampfer et al . , 2021 ) . Understanding the 111 toxicological effects of each NP type is critical for any prediction of their immediate and long - 112 term risks for humans and ecosystems . Therefore , our study aimed to identify the low - dose and 113 non - cytotoxic effects of ZnO NPs and SWCNT to get deeper insights into their cellular 114 interaction . 115 116 2 . Materials and Methods 117 2 . 1 . Chemicals and materials 118 ZnO NPs dispersion ( Cas . No . 1314 - 13 - 2 ; purity ) and SWCNT powder ( Cat . No . 704121 - 119 250MG ) , penicillin - streptomycin solution ( Cat . No . P4333 ) , MTT dye ( Cat . No . M5655 - 1G ) , 120 Neutral red dye ( Cat . No . N4638 - 1G ) and Trypan Blue dye ( Cat . No . T6146 - 100G ) were 121 purchased from Sigma Aldrich ( St . Louise , MO ) . Fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Cat . No . CCS - 500 - 122 SA - U ) , Dulbecco ' s Modified Eagle ' s Medium ( DMEM ) 1X with 4 . 5 g / L glucose , 4 . 0 mM L - 123 glutamine , and sodium pyruvate ( Cat . No . CC3004 . 05L ) , Dimethylsulphoxide ( DMSO , Cat . 124 No . PG - 1320 - 500mL ) all were purchased from CellClone TM Genetix Biotech Asia Pvt Ltd . 125 6 India . Dulbecco ' s phosphate buffer saline ( DPBS , Cat . No . SH30013 . 02 ) without calcium and 126 magnesium was obtained from Hyclone Laboratories ( Logan , UT ) . 127 128 2 . 2 . Cell culture and exposure of nanoparticles 129 HepG2 cells were procured from National Centre for Cell Sciences ( NCCS ) , Pune , India , and 130 further grown in DMEM 1X medium supplemented with 10 % FBS , 1 % streptomycin and 131 penicillin solution , in 25 cm 2 flask , at 37 ° C in 5 % CO 2 humified atmosphere . The cells were 132 used between 15 - 20 passages for each experiment . HepG2 cells were plated at a density of 133 3x10 5 cells / ml in a 96 well plate and allowed to attach for 24 h before the treatment of NPs . 134 The NPs were suspended in PBS to make the stock solution of 5 mg / ml and diluted to desired 135 concentrations . The stock solution of NPs was sonicated on an ice bath for 10 min before giving 136 treatment to the cells using a Branson ultrasonicator with a 13 mm probe diameter . 137 138 2 . 3 . MTT assay 139 The cell viability was assessed by utilising the MTT assay according to Mosmann ( 1983 ) 140 method with some modifications ( Mosmann , 1983 ) . First , the HepG2 cells were exposed to the 141 NPs at the indicated concentrations for the different incubation periods . The medium was then 142 removed and replaced with 10 µl of MTT [ 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazoyl - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - 143 diphenyltetrazolium bromide ] dye ( 5 mg / ml ) prepared in PBS and incubated for 4 h at 37 ° C . 144 After incubation , the resulting formazan crystals were dissolved by adding 100 µl of 145 dimethylsulphoxide , and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm in a multiplate reader . Three 146 independent experiments were performed . 147 148 7 2 . 4 . Neutral Red Uptake assay 149 The neutral red uptake ( NRU ) assay was performed according to Repetto et al with slight 150 modification ( Repetto et al . , 2008 ) . After the exposure of NPs , the medium was discarded , and 151 100 µl of neutral red dye ( 40 µg / ml ) dissolved in serum - free medium was added to each well 152 in a 96 well plate . After the desired incubation time was over , the excess dye solution was 153 removed , and 150 µl of destaining solution ( 50 % ethanol , 49 % deionised water and 1 % glacial 154 acetic acid ) was added . The plates were gently shaken , and absorbance was measured at 540 155 nm on an Infinite M200 multi - well plate reader ( Tecan , Durham , USA ) . Three independent 156 experiments were performed . 157 158 2 . 5 . Trypan blue dye exclusion method 159 Trypan blue assay relies on the accumulation of dye in dead cells but is excluded from live 160 cells and is the most commonly used procedure for cell viability assessment ( Ishiyama et al . , 161 1996 ; Strober , 2015 ) . For trypan blue assay , 2 x 10 5 cells were seeded in 24 well plate in 2 mL 162 of complete culture medium and allowed to adhere for 24 h . The cells were then treated with 163 ZnO NPs and SWCNT in a dose and time - dependent manner . After the exposure time , the cells 164 were thoroughly washed with PBS , followed by incubation with trypsin and pelleted . These 165 pelleted cells were dispersed in a fresh medium along with an equal volume of trypan blue ( 10 166 µl ) . Finally , the viable cells were counted using a Neubauer haemocytometer , where cell 167 viability was assessed by counting both live and dead cells . The cell viability was calculated 168 based on a triplicate of experiments . 169 170 2 . 6 . Reactive oxygen species measurement with DCFH - DA assay 171 Intracellular ROS level was measured using dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate ( DCFH - DA ) 172 assay ( Wang and Joseph , 1999 ) . Briefly , the HepG2 cells were seeded in 96 well black plates 173 8 and incubated with ZnO NPs and SWCNT ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 25 and 50 µg / ml ) for 1 , 3 , 6 and 174 12 h . After exposure , the cells were washed with PBS and loaded with 10 µM DCFH - DA dye 175 in PBS for 40 min at 37°C . After that , the cells were washed with PBS and fluorescence was 176 recorded . 177 178 2 . 7 . Cell exposure for RNA sequencing experiment 179 HepG2 cells were allowed to grow for 24 h , at a density of 10 6 cells / ml , in a 25 cm 2 cell culture 180 flask . Then , the medium was replaced with the fresh cell culture medium containing ZnO NPs 181 and SWCNT . Cells with only a fresh cell culture medium were used as a control sample . Low 182 cytotoxic concentrations were chosen ( ZnO NPs : 2 µg / ml , SWCNT : 10 µg / ml ) for further 183 transcriptomic analysis at which more than 80 % viability was achieved ( according to cell 184 viability assay ) . 185 186 2 . 8 . RNA purification and library construction : RNA isolation and sequencing 187 Total RNA was extracted from nanoparticles treated and untreated ( control ) HepG2 cells using 188 the RNeasy mini kit ( Qiagen GMBH , Hilden , Germany ) following the manufacturer ' s 189 recommendations . The integrity of total RNA was assessed using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyser 190 ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) ( Figure S1 , S2 and S3 ) . The NEBNext® 191 Ultra TM Directional RNA Library Prep Kit ( New England Biolabs , MA , USA ) was used to 192 prepare the RNA - seq library of an individual sample . The average RIN was > 8 . 0 ( Figure S4 ) , 193 and the 1 μg of pooled total RNA was taken for mRNA isolation , fragmentation and priming . 194 Fragmented and primed mRNA was further subjected to the first - strand synthesis in 195 Actinomycin D ( Gibco , Life Technologies , CA , USA ) , followed by second - strand synthesis . 196 The double - stranded cDNA was purified using HighPrep magnetic beads ( Magbio Genomics 197 Inc , USA ) . Purified cDNA was end - repaired , adenylated and ligated to Illumina multiplex 198 9 barcode adapters . Adapter ligated cDNA was purified using HighPrep beads and was subjected 199 to 12 cycles of Indexing - PCR ( 37 ˚C for 15 mins followed by denaturation at 98˚C for 30 sec , 200 cycling ( 98˚C for 10sec , 65˚C for 75sec ) and 65˚C for 5mins ) to enrich the adapter - ligated 201 fragments . The final PCR product ( sequencing library ) was purified with HighPrep beads , 202 followed by a library - quality control check . The Illumina - compatible sequencing library was 203 quantified by Qubit fluorometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , MA , USA ) , and its fragment size 204 distribution was analysed on Agilent 2200 Tapestation . Samples were then sequenced using 205 the Illumina Genome Analyzer ( HiSeq 2500v4 High Output ) . 206 207 2 . 9 . Data analysis 208 FastQC ( version 0 . 11 . 2 ) was used for quality control to ensure that the quality value was above 209 Q30 . The Human ( Homo sapiens ) genome FASTA file ( ftp : / / ftp . ensembl . org / pub / release - 210 100 / fasta / homo _ sapiens / dna / ) and gene annotation GTF file ( Human ( GRCh38 . p13 ) assembly ; 211 ftp : / / ftp . ensembl . org / pub / release - 100 / gtf / homo _ sapiens / ) were obtained from Ensembl . 212 Although RNA - seq is a popular research tool , there is no gold standard for analysing the data . 213 Therefore , we chose up - to - date open - source tools for mapping , retrieving read counts , and 214 differential analysis among the available tools . We used HISAT2 ( version 2 . 0 . 3 - beta ) ( Kim et 215 al . , 2015 ) to generate indexes and map reads to the human genome . For assembly , we chose 216 SAMtools ( version 1 . 2 ) and the " union " mode of HTSeq ( version 0 . 6 . 1 ) ( Anders et al . , 2015 ) , 217 as the gene - level read counts could provide more flexibility in the differential expression 218 analysis . Both HISAT2 and HTSeq analyses were conducted in the Linux operating system 219 ( version 2 . 6 . 32 ) . Differential expression and statistical analysis were performed using DESeq2 220 ( release 3 . 3 ) in R ( version 3 . 2 . 4 ) . DESeq2 ( Love et al . , 2014 ) was chosen as a popular 221 parametric tool that provides a descriptive and continually updated user manual 222 ( https : / / bioconductor . org / packages / release / bioc / vignettes / DESeq2 / inst / doc / DESeq2 . html ) . 223 10 DESeq2 internally corrects library size , so it is essential to offer un - normalised raw read counts 224 as input . We used variance stabilising transformation to account for differences in sequencing 225 depth . P - values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini - Hochberg procedure 226 ( Benjamini and Hocheberg , 1995 ) . A false discovery rate adjusted p - value ( i . e . , q - value ) < 0 . 05 227 was set to select DE genes . 228 229 2 . 10 . Bioinformatics analysis 230 The list of differential expression of genes was utilised to observe transcriptional snapshots 231 through bioinformatics analysis . First , the GO and pathway were initially identified through 232 the DAVID analyses using the right - tailed Fisher Exact test and displayed z - scores . Then , the 233 overrepresentation test was performed in PANTHER version 11 . 1 ( http : / / www . pantherdb . org / , 234 released on October 24 , 2016 ) using the binomial test and Bonferroni correction for multiple 235 testing . 236 237 In PANTHER , only pathways and GO terms with fold enrichment > 0 . 2 and p - value > 0 . 05 238 were listed . The pathway enrichment analysis of up and downregulated genes was performed 239 using the R package , cluster profile package ( Yu et al . , 2012 ) with a p - value cutoff of ≥ 0 . 05 . 240 All the graphical analyses were performed in the R environment using respective tools . 241 Histograms , density scatter plots , Box plots , Volcano plots and Principal Component Analysis 242 ( PCA ) were generated using the ggPlot2 package . Finally , all the identified genes were mapped 243 with Uniprot human chromosomal proteome information and parsed to create files 244 appropriately formatted for input to Circos ( Krzywinski et al . , 2009 ) . 245 246 11 2 . 11 . Statistical analysis 247 The data were analysed using GraphPad Prism 5 . 01 ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , 248 California , USA , https : / / www . graphpad . com / ) . The significance of the difference between 249 mean values was calculated by one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with Tukey ' s posthoc 250 test . The data were represented as mean ± SD , and the value of p < 0 . 05 was considered 251 statistically significant . 252 253 3 . Results and Discussion 254 3 . 1 . Dose determination and cytotoxicity assessment for nanoparticles treatment 255 The cytotoxicity assays were performed on HepG2 cells to select the suitable dose and acute 256 exposure for transcriptomics analysis . The aim is to find the non - cytotoxic dose that would 257 better mimic the real - life exposure scenario and predict actual nano - bio interactions . Most of 258 the studies previously performed considered a high dose , acute exposure of NPs considering 259 various animal and cellular systems . These extreme exposures overwhelm the cellular system , 260 consequently leads to necrosis and ultimately death . The cell viability assays ( Figure 1 ) were 261 performed in HepG2 cells exposed to ZnO NPs and SWCNT in a broad concentration ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 262 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 µg / ml ) range and time ( 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 h ) . 263 12 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 Figure 1 : The cell viability and oxidative stress analysis in HepG2 cells exposed to ZnO 282 NPs and SWCNT . ( A ) MTT , ( B ) Trypan blue assay and ( C ) DCFH - DA assay and ( D ) Nitic 283 oxide assay was performed to assess the cellular viability after exposure of ZnO NPs and 284 SWCNT for 3 , 6 , 12 and 24 h in a concentration ( 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 µg / ml ) dependent manner . 285 All the assay values were normalised with non - treated control , the viability of which is 286 represented as 100 % . Results are shown as mean values ± SD obtained from three independent 287 13 experiments ( n = 3 ) . Statistical analysis was performed using two - way ANOVA followed by 288 Bonferroni post - test . 289 In the MTT assay , significant effects were observed in ZnO NPs ( Figure 1A ) even at low 290 concentrations than SWCNT ( Figure 1B ) . No significant impact was seen on the cellular 291 viability at 3 h of exposure . However , at 6 h incubation ZnO NPs was able to compromise the 292 cell viability significantly ( p < 0 . 05 ; ̴ 75 % cell viability ) at a concentration of 5 µg / ml while the 293 same dose of SWCNT was non - toxic . At a dose of 10 µg / ml , significant ( p < 0 . 001 ) diminution 294 of the cell viability of about 70 % at 6 h , 60 % at 12 h and < 50 % at 24 h was observed for ZnO 295 NPs . 296 297 On the other hand , SWCNT is not causing harm to the HepG2 cells at the same dose even at 298 the exposure of 12 h . The highest ZnO NPs dose , 50 µg / ml , had the prominent ( p < 0 . 001 ) effect 299 with almost 50 % diminished viability at 12 h , and 80 % loss at 24 h was found , whereas 300 SWCNT at the same dose was observed to be toxic at 24 h only . This observation indicates that 301 ZnO NPs is responsible for causing extensive damage to cells and is more harmful than 302 SWCNT . Therefore , we did not pursue after 50 µg / ml dose . In contrast to MTT , the results of 303 NRU assay ( Figure 1 ) showed significantly ( p < 0 . 01 ) compromised lysosomal integrity at a 304 lower concentration of ZnO NPs ( Figure 1C ) ( 2 µg / ml ) following exposure to 6 h , but cells 305 maintained the viability by more than 80 % as compared to control . With the increasing 306 concentration of ZnO NPs , the viability of the HepG2 cells decreased at 6 h of incubation , 307 whereas the SWCNT ( Figure 1D ) was not affecting the viability at any of the concentrations . 308 At 12 h of exposure , the viability was significantly ( p < 0 . 05 ) reduced to 40 % at 10 µg / ml . More 309 subtle effects were seen at increased doses , i . e . 20 and 50 µg / ml , with significant ( p < 0 . 0001 ) 310 loss of viability to almost 80 % . 311 312 14 The assay results of MTT and NRU are quite contradictory because both rely on different 313 mechanisms , therefore , showing other cytotoxicity measurements , majorly in SWCNT . One of 314 the primary reasons could be the potential interaction of the NPs with the assay components 315 that can confound the results obtained ( Ong et al . , 2014 , Breznan et al . , 2015 ) . To overcome 316 the issue , we also performed a trypan blue assay ( Figure 1E and F ) based on the direct dye 317 exclusion from live cells and could eliminate the interference ( Hoskins et al . , 2012 ) . However , 318 the interaction of NPs with the cells was so strong that even with subsequent washes , they 319 remain adhered with the cells during early incubation ( Tsai et al . , 2011 ) , but as the cells remain 320 in the presence of NPs , they lose their adherence properties and detach from the cell culture 321 plates specifically during 24 h . This behaviour of cells was observed in the case of ZnO NPs 322 more abruptly than SWCNT , as described previously that carbon nanotubes can act as a 323 scaffold ( Rafeeqi and Kaul , 2010 ) . Trypan blue showed concentration and time - dependent 324 manner reduction in cell viability most prevalent at high dose ( 50 µg / ml ) of ZnO NPs ( Figure 325 1E ) when exposed for 6 h but as incubation time increases the significant cellular viability was 326 compromised at 5 µg / ml of dose . In the case of SWCNT ( Figure 1F ) , the amount at which cell 327 viability is almost 70 % compromised was found to be 10 µg / ml after incubation of 24 h . 328 329 We investigated the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) as an NPs 330 mechanism to induce cell death . The oxidative stress levels were minimal at the lower 331 incubation exposure period , i . e . 1 h and 3 h , but a slight increase was observed at 6 h at higher 332 doses of > 20 µg / ml . In contrast , the exposure of NPs for 12 h exerted the effect at the lower 333 dose of 2 µg / ml in the case of ZnO NPs ( Figure 1G ) . The SWCNT increases ROS level at 6 h 334 of exposure , even at the lowest dose ( 1 µg / ml ) ( Figure 1H ) . Considering the results , 10 μg / ml 335 concentration of SWCNT was chosen as a non - cytotoxic dose showing no significant cell death 336 15 but indicating some response against the external exposure . Thus , it corresponds to a sub - 337 chronic rather acute toxic response . 338 339 3 . 2 . Overview of Transcriptional landscape of HepG2 cells responded to ZnO NPs and 340 SWCNT 341 To elucidate the underlying molecular response of the biological system at a lower dose and 342 short term exposure of NPs , we performed a genome - wide relative transcriptomic investigation 343 in HepG2 cells . The present NGS based comprehensive RNA sequencing study generated 344 about ~ 200 million reads at Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform ( Figure 2A ) . 345 346 Figure 2 : Schematic presentation of complete work flow for the analysis of nanoparticle 347 exposure to HepG2 cell line 348 16 The ample number of reads showed the robustness of the experiment and provided a strong 349 background to identify trustable results . The sequenced basic information was quality checked 350 using FastQC and pre - processing by Cutadapt , which includes removing adapter sequences 351 and low - quality bases ( < q30 ) . The high - quality data were then aligned to the reference genome 352 of Homo sapiens GRCh38 and classified into aligned and unaligned reads using fast and 353 sensitive spliced alignment programme HISAT . Approximately 90 % of sequence reads were 354 aligned to GRCh38genome ( Figure S5 ) signifies superiority of reads and excellent mapping 355 efficiency . After the normalisation , a total of 150 million high - quality adapter free reads was 356 obtained that were utilised for further analysis ( Figure 2B ) . In this way , the 50 million reads 357 per sample were retained for downstream analysis . Precisely , the obtained million reads are 358 54 . 323 for control , 46 . 249 for ZnO2 and 47 . 337 in the case of SWCNT10 . The transcript 359 abundance was estimated in the form of FPKM values for measuring gene / transcript 360 expression . The comparisons were made between the control , and NPs treated samples which 361 revealed differential expression ( DE ) of 11 , 027 , expressed genes ; 5 , 474 upregulated ( p ≤0 . 05 ; 362 277 ) , 5 , 553 downregulated ( p ≤0 . 05 ; 215 ) , genes in ZnO NPs and 8 , 099 ; 4 , 287 upregulated ( p 363 ≤0 . 05 ; 331 ) , 3 , 812 downregulated ( p ≤0 . 05 ; 146 ) genes in SWCNT . The transcripts with log2 364 expression value ≥1 . 5 and log2 ≤0 . 66 were considered as upregulated and downregulated , 365 respectively . 366 367 Furthermore , the data was scrutinised , and we considered ≥ 3 folds up and downregulated genes 368 ( Table S1 ) for the further analysis process . This strategy was adopted to provide more stringent 369 results and essential information about highly regulated genes . As we have considered acute 370 exposure conditions of NPs , we hypothesised that the sudden or rapid expression of genes 371 during the early exposure would provide the actual snapshot of NPs effect on the cellular 372 system . With the fold change cut off , a total of 1762 upregulated and ZnO2 NPs deregulated 373 17 1163 downregulated genes and for the treatment of SWCNT10 , 1195 upregulated , and 1124 374 downregulated genes were found ( Table S1 ) . 375 376 The total differential expressed transcriptome classification revealed a high number of 377 contributing mRNAs from chromosomes 2 , 17 and 19 . In contrast , the minor transcripts were 378 expressed by 13 , 18 , 21 , and Y chromosomes ( Figure 3A ) . The normalised data represent the 379 cumulative equal abundance ( Figure 3B ) and detailed the normally distributed data ( Figure 380 3C ) . The coefficient of correlation for FPKM values is more than 0 . 98 ( Figure 3D and E ) . 381 382 18 Figure 3 : 383 384 The quality check showed the best segregation of the nanoparticles treated transcriptome 385 ( Figure 4A ) . We highlighted the specific cell cycle - associated and DNA damage proteins in 386 the rank plot ( Figure 4B and C ) . 387 388 Figure 4 : Principle Component analysis . Complete PCA analysis and rank plot of 389 differentially abundant transcripts . 390 391 3 . 3 . Ontological classification of genes altered from ZnO NPs and SWCNT treatment 392 Using several ontological databases , differentially expressed genes for both NPs were 393 distributed among various gene ontology ( GO ) categories ( Figure 2C ) such as biological 394 process ( BP ) , cellular component ( CC ) , molecular function ( MF ) , and pathways to answer the 395 critical biological questions of what , when , and why these genes are expressed in response to 396 NPs . We selected these ontological terms based on their higher significance of individual 397 19 p≤0 . 05 with multiple hypothesis 2 post - test corrected p values ( p≤0 . 05 ) Bonferroni and 398 ( p≤0 . 05 ) Benjamini corrected followed with the FDR less than 0 . 05 . In this way , the deciphered 399 key functions better interrogate the interaction of NPs with HepG2 liver cells . Even after 400 filtering to multiple tight parameters , high degree of consistency between the ontologies were 401 found related to endocytosis ( GO : 0006897 ; ZnO2 p - value 1 . 55E - 05 , SWCNT10 p - value 402 1 . 11E - 04 ) , ubiquitination ( GO : 0042787 ; ZnO2 p - value 5 . 49E - 04 , SWCNT10 p - value 403 0 . 027198 ) , cell - cell adhesion ( GO : 0098609 ; ZnO2 p - value 8 . 89E - 09 , SWCNT10 p - value 404 0 . 011429 ) , cellular response to DNA damage stimulus ( GO : 0006974 ; ZnO2 p - value , 1 . 83E - 405 04 , SWCNT10 p - value 0 . 014698137 ) , DNA repair ( GO : 0006281 ; ZnO2 p - value 8 . 81E - 04 , 406 SWCNT10 p - value 21 . 33E - 06 ) and cell migration ( GO : 0016477 ; ZnO2 p - value 0 . 06196377 , 407 SWCNT10 p - value 0 . 018241486 ) were significantly over enriched for both the NPs groups . 408 409 Furthermore , we also identified a considerable number of genes scattered in different locations 410 in a cell also obtained through cellular component category genes involved in the cytoplasm 411 ( GO : 0005737 ; ZnO2 p - value 4 . 17E - 22 , SWCNT10 p - value 1 . 43E - 18 ) , nucleus ( GO : 005634 ; 412 ZnO2 p - value 2 . 93E - 14 SWCNT10 p - value 1 . 08E - 12 ) , nucleoplasm ( GO : 0005654 ; ZnO2 p - 413 value 1 . 09E - 14 , SWCNT10 p - value 2 . 86E - 14 ) , cell - cell adherens junction ( GO : 0005913 ; 414 ZnO2 p - value 1 . 18E - 09 , SWCNT10 p - value 0 . 002373005 ) , focal adhesion ( GO : 0005925 ; 415 ZnO2 p - value 3 . 12E - 06 , SWCNT10 p - value 6 . 50E - 04 ) , and nuclear matrix ( GO : 0016363 ; 416 ZnO2 p - value 0 . 001027326 , SWCNT10 p - value 9 . 64E - 04 ) were most significantly counted . In 417 terms of molecular function , the most significant terms were related to protein binding 418 ( GO : 0005515 ) , zinc ion binding ( GO : 0008270 ) , ATP binding ( GO : 0005524 ) ( Table S2 ) . 419 Based on the categorisation of the GO , we distinguish six reflex processes of HepG2 cells , 420 including DNA damage , DNA repair , cell cycle , cytoskeleton , transcriptional changes , 421 ubiquitin - mediated proteasomal degradation of proteins . The elaborated list ( with FPKM 422 20 values and Fold change ) of common and unique genes for ZnO NPs and SWCNT , considered 423 for the subsequent preparation of the Venn diagram , is provided in the supplementary TableS4 . 424 We have observed similar and unique processes against the NPs insult , but we are interested in 425 looking closely at the processes and their associated genes that the two different types of NPs 426 have commonly perturbed . 427 428 3 . 4 . The interplay of NPs internalisation and subsequent changes in the cytoskeletal 429 structure of the cells 430 The process of endocytosis considers the central gateway through the cell . Various materials 431 can also exploit the process of endocytosis to gain entry inside the cells ( Oh and Park et al . , 432 2014 ) . However , the NPs must be internalised by the cells to carry out their functions or , in 433 other words , to regulate cellular processes . Therefore , unravelling the role of the internalisation 434 mechanism opens up new avenues in the design and development of novel nanocarrier systems 435 and their potential effects . In this frame , our RNA sequencing data suggested a significant 436 enrichment of endocytosis ( GO : 0006897 ) ( Table S3 ) process for the log 2 fold change > 3 437 deregulated genes in case of both the ZnO2 ( p - value 1 . 55E - 05 ) NPs and SWCNT10 ( p - value 438 1 . 11E - 04 ) . Strikingly , 25 % of the common upregulated and 21 % downregulated transcripts 439 were observed by the Venn comparisons for the process of endocytosis ( Figure 5A ) , giving 440 clues of the potential intracellular trafficking network of NPs . 441 21 442 443 444 445 446 447 448 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 Figure 5 : Summary of ZnO NPs and SWCNT perturbed gene detected by RNA - sequencing , 462 distributed for Endocytosis and Cell cytoskeleton related biological process . Venn diagram of 463 differentially expressed genes representing overlapped and NPs specific upregulated and 464 downregulated genes with FC ≥3 in the biological process categories ( A ) Endocytosis and ( C ) 465 Cell cytoskeleton . ( B , D ) Showing heatmap of the genes detected in the overlap of the Venn 466 22 diagrams changed by both the NPs . Columns are ordered by FPKM values of control , ZnO 467 NPs , SWCNT and calculated values of log2 fold change . Blue to red denotes low to high 468 expression as shown on the scale . The common upregulated genes representative of the 469 endocytosis process includes CANX , CTTN , EPN2 , LMBR1L , CAP1 , MYO6 , ARFGAP1 , 470 PICALM , BCL2L1 , TMPRSS2 and LDLR . 471 472 Notably , subsequent heatmap analysis ( Figure 5B ) showed a similar level of this transcript 473 abundance based on their FPKM values regulated in response to ZnO2 NPs and SWCNT10 . 474 Before the NPs reach the exterior membranes , they must interact with the microenvironment 475 around the target cells . The dynamic physiochemical interactions play a significant role at the 476 nano - bio interface that governs the actual effect of NPs on a cell ( Nel et al . , 2009 ) . When the 477 NPs first encounter the extracellular components , they contact various biomolecules such as 478 proteins ( or biomolecules secreted by cells in the medium ) and form a protein corona that is 479 majorly responsible for changing the physicochemical composition of NPs . These newly 480 acquired properties have a profound effect on the cell - NPs interactions ( Francia et al . , 2019 ) 481 wherein , they can act as a ligand to be engaged with cell surface receptors to enhance the uptake 482 of NPs ( Lara et al . , 2017 ) . This could be explained , at least partly , by the high upregulation of 483 the LDLR gene ( Low - density lipoprotein receptor ) ( ZnO2 FC : 12 . 46 , SWCNT10 FC : 12 . 49 ) , 484 giving us a clue about recognition of protein corona by cell - surface LDL receptor . In another 485 way , it can be correlated to the secretion of Apolipoprotein by HepG2 cells and its interaction 486 with NPs as one of the constituents of protein corona and further interaction with the LDL 487 receptor mediating the receptor - mediated endocytosis of NPs . 488 489 Cellular internalisation can initiate various processes , including the formation of early 490 endosomes and sort of the outside material , just as in the case of ZnO2 NPs and SWCNT10 491 23 suggested by the significantly enriched CC GO term early endosome ( GO : 0005769 : ZnO2 p - 492 value 3 . 57E - 04 , SWCNT10 p - value 0 . 002291876 ) ( Table S3 ) . As previously defined , much 493 cytoskeletal protein machinery plays a significant role during the process of endocytosis . Most 494 importantly , actin polymerisation provides a sufficient force for membrane invagination and 495 resulting in vesicle budding . It is anticipated that dynamic changes in the actin structures are a 496 crucial step in the process of clathrin - mediated endocytosis that ultimately provides enough 497 force for membrane bending ( Skruzny et al . , 2012 ) . It is also explained by significant GO 498 enrichment of actin cytoskeleton reorganisation ( GO : 0031532 ) in our transcriptomics data with 499 subsequent cellular component category including actin cytoskeleton ( GO : 0015629 : ZnO2 p - 500 value 0 . 001249031 , SWCNT10 p - value 0 . 020259711 ) and focal adhesion ( GO : 0005925 : ZnO2 501 p - value 3 . 12E - 06 , SWCNT10 p - value 6 . 50E - 04 ) for both the NPs ( Table S3 ) . The upregulation 502 of CTTN , cortactin protein ( ZnO2 FC : 6 . 5 , SWCNT10 FC : 7 . 2 ) ( Figure 5C and D ) , responsible 503 for vesicle scission from the plasma membrane ( Cao et al . , 2003 ) . 504 505 Consistent with these observations , we can say that NPs internalisation is correlated with the 506 altered cytoskeletal structure and cells ability to sense the changing biophysical properties of 507 extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . On the other hand , altering ECM due to NPs internalisation alters 508 other critical cellular functions such as proliferation , migration , cell membrane structure , and 509 organisation ( Panzetta et al . , 2107 ) . This is evidenced in our transcriptomics dataset where the 510 major BP category comprised significantly cell - cell adhesion ( GO : 0098609 : ZnO2 p - value 511 8 . 89E - 09 , SWCNT10 p - value 0 . 011428656 ) and cell migration ( GO : 0016477 : ZnO2 p - value 512 0 . 06196377 , SWCNT10 0 . 018241486 ) . 513 514 It was also mentioned that NPs could gain access to the cellular microenvironment through 515 non - specific interactions ( Behzadi et al . , 2017 ) . Cells from mechanically active environments 516 24 can couple mixed signals from forces applied through β - integrins to upregulate the production 517 of cytoprotective cytoskeletal proteins , typified by filamin A ( FLNA ) ( ZnO2 FC : 8 . 2 , 518 SWCNT10 FC : 6 . 2 ) ( Figure 5D ) ( D ' Addario et al . , 2001 ) . 519 520 3 . 5 . Impact of Nanoparticles on the DNA Damage and Repair Related Genes 521 Cells maintain highly complex signalling processes and are programmed to sense the damage . 522 Thus , it regulates multifaceted responses to maintain the cellular physiology against external 523 stimuli . Previously many studies have identified the DNA damaging potential of NPs at higher 524 concentrations . For instance , Sharma et al observed that the ZnO NPs could cause oxidative 525 stress - mediated DNA damage in HepG2 cells ( Sharma et al . , 2012 ) . Similarly , Chk1 - dependent 526 G2 / M , DNA damage checkpoint signalling pathway , activated in response to silica NPs at 100 527 µg / ml , resulted in cell cycle arrest due to oxidative DNA damage ( Duan et al . , 2013 ) . One of 528 the studies conducted in our lab observed potential DNA damage in buffalo sperms when 529 exposed to lower concentrations of TiO 2 NPs ( Pawar and Kaul , 2014 ) . In the present study , we 530 observed DNA damage even at the low , non - cytotoxic doses of NPs ( as described by 531 cytotoxicity analysis , Figure 1A - H ) and interestingly found that both NPs exert similar 532 responses at the transcriptomic level ( Table S3 ) . The comparison can be easily made in Venn ' s 533 diagram analysis prepared by genes of enriched DNA damage category that spans 21 % 534 upregulated genes , and 7 % downregulated genes ( Figure 6A ) altered by both the NPs . 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 25 542 Figure 6 : Summary of ZnO NPs and SWCNT perturbed gene detected by RNA - sequencing , 543 distributed for DNA damage , repair and cell cycle - related biological process .

( B , C , D ) Showing heatmap of the genes detected in 547 26 the overlap of the Venn diagrams changed by both the NPs . Columns are ordered by FPKM 548 values of control , ZnO NPs , SWCNT and calculated values of log2 fold change . Blue to red 549 denotes low to high expression as shown on the scale . ( E ) The PPI network of DNA damage 550 and DNA repair . 551 552 A similar observation was captured previously , where similar expression patterns for different 553 types of NPs ( TiO2 NPs and MWCNT ) during 4 h of incubation were induced in the cell as a 554 general mechanism for toxicity ( Tilton et al . , 2014 ) . 555 556 Venn diagram also represents 48 . 6 % genes for ZnO2 NPs , 23 % genes for SWCNT10 to be 557 upregulated , and 58 . 7 % for ZnO2 NPs and 30 . 2 % downregulated genes SWCNT10 in the DNA 558 damage process ( Figure 6A ) . The presence of multiple GO terms including DNA repair 559 ( GO : 0006281 ; ZnO2 p - value 8 . 81E - 04 , SWCNT10 p - value 1 . 33E - 06 ) , cellular response to 560 DNA damage stimulus ( GO : 0006974 ; ZnO2 p - value 1 . 83E - 04 , SWCNT10 p - value 561 0 . 014698137 ) and mitotic cell cycle checkpoint ( GO : 0007093 ; ZnO2 p - value 0 . 016635545 , 562 SWCNT10 p - value 0 . 001777846 ) were shown to be significantly altered ( Table S3 ) and proves 563 that NPs treatment resulted in the significant disturbance in these processes ( Figure 6B - E ) . 564 Hierarchical clustering of the genes enriched for DNA damage and repair ( Figure 6B and D ) 565 reveals potential deregulated transcripts in response to NPs exposure . These enriched pathways 566 propose that DNA damage be persuaded in HepG2 after exposure to ZnO2 NPs and 567 SWCNT10 . 568 569 Generally , the DNA repair system gets activated once the cells experience damage induced by 570 NPs to minimise the negative impact of the injury on cell proliferation ( Carriere et al . , 2016 ) . 571 The checkpoint network must sense the damage and promptly spread such signals to reach the 572 27 downstream cellular effector proteins . The perfect correlation among those genes was observed 573 in the similarity analysis , where malfunction of Rad17 ( ZnO2 FC : - 11 . 3 , SWCNT10 FC : - 574 10 . 3 ) , a critical signalling node of DNA damage signalling , has been linked to various cancer 575 statuses . The upregulation of RAD related proteins provides a high - fidelity tolerance 576 mechanism against DNA damage stress . The upregulated gene RAD51B ( ZnO2 FC : 5 . 6 , 577 SWCNT10 FC : 6 . 11 ) takes part in homologous recombination repair and influence the cell 578 cycle progression against DNA damage ( Lee et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 6E ) . We also observed that 579 upon stimulation to NPs , specific categories of genes were upregulated that actively takes part 580 in DNA repair pathways such as DDB1 ( ZnO2 FC : 3 . 4 , SWCNT FC : 3 . 8 ) . DDB1 forms a 581 heterodimer with DDB2 , subsequently with CUL4A E3 ligase that actively mediates the 582 ubiquitination of target proteins such as histones and ensures efficient activation of nucleotide 583 excision repair at the DNA lesion site ( Li et al . , 2006 ) . This CUL4A E3 ligase complex interacts 584 with another upregulated gene DTL ( ZnO2 FC : 3 . 2 , SWCNT10 FC : 3 . 4 ) is necessary for early 585 G2 / M checkpoint ( Sansam et al . , 2006 ) and protecting HepG2 cells . 586 587 A regulatory kinase gene CSNK1E significantly overexpressed ( ZnO2 FC : 14 , SWCNT10 FC : 588 14 . 4 ) responsible for phosphorylating p53 under stress conditions , consequently weakening its 589 interaction with its cellular counterpart MDM2 and activates it ( p53 phosphorylation , 590 phosphorylation p53 by CK1 , CK1 p53 threonine kinase ) . But TP53BP1 is downregulated , and 591 MDM2 is upregulated in our case . This is explained as the levels of casein kinase is very high 592 ( 14 FC ) , and its starts are phosphorylating p53 to activate . It also regulates the beta - catenine 593 dependent WNT pathway positively by phosphorylating and stimulating the activity of the 594 dishevelled protein ( Klimowski et al . , 2006 ) . Another gene from serine / threonine kinase family 595 PLK3 is involved in the cell cycle progression , apoptosis ( Wang et al . , 2002 ) , and DNA damage 596 was downregulated ( Xie et al . , 2001 ) . In addition , it phosphorylates and regulates the number 597 28 of other effector molecules such as Bcl - xL ( Wang et al . , 2011 ) , Chk2 ( Bahassi et al . , 2006 ) , 598 p53 ( Bahassi et al . , 2002 ) and ATF2 ( Wang et al . , 2011 ) . In particular , some of the 599 phosphorylation targets of PLK3 , including Bcl - xL and ATF2 , are upregulated by NPs , but 600 others ( Chk2 ) are downregulating . The gene PLK3 also cause degradation of wee1 kinase 601 ( downregulated in the cell cycle ) , a negative regulator of the cell cycle involved in re - entry into 602 cell cycle progression ( Figure 6C ) . 603 604 The NPs treated cells show the downregulation of some cell cycle checkpoint protein such as 605 RAD17 ( rad17 cell cycle checkpoint ) . It may be due to proteolysis by cdh1 / APC , resulting in 606 the termination of checkpoint signalling and recovery from genotoxic stress . In summary , our 607 low dose transcriptomics analysis proves that ZnO2 NPs and SWCNT10 could induce DNA 608 damage , oxidative stress and affect the HepG2 cells . Our study provides a comprehensive 609 analysis of how exposure to ZnO2 NPs and SWCNT10 on HepG2 cells could affect its 610 molecular landscape and whether these changes are beneficial or detrimental for the HepG2 611 cells ( Figure 6E ) . 612 613 3 . 6 . Transcriptional changes in response to NPs 614 It is crucial to know how the NPs regulate various genes ' spatial and temporal expression by 615 altering the transcriptional machinery for mRNA synthesis ( Figure 7A ) . 616 29 617 618 619 620 621 622 623 624 625 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 634 635 636 Figure 7 : ( A ) Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes representing overlapped and NPs 637 specific upregulated and downregulated genes with FC ≥3 in the transcription and 638 ubiquitination related biological process categories .

Columns are 640 ordered by FPKM values of control , ZnO NPs , SWCNT and calculated values of log2 fold 641 30 change . Blue to red denotes low to high expression as shown on the scale . ( C ) The PPI network 642 of transcription related biological process . ( D ) The PPI network of ubiquitination related 643 transcripts . 644 In this context , the poly ( A ) tail is the major determining factor for the turnover rates of mRNAs 645 under different cellular conditions . We found that the gene expression changes resulted from 646 NPs treatment in mRNA turnover through major identified GO terms ( Table S2 ) . This includes 647 nuclear - transcribed mRNA poly ( A ) tail shortening ( GO : 0000289 ; ZnO2 p - value 1 . 41E - 05 ) , 648 regulation of mRNA stability ( GO : 0043488 , ZnO2 p - value 0 . 0010776 ) , regulation of 649 transcription DNA templated ( GO : 0006355 , ZnO2 p - value 0 . 004395587 ) , regulation of DNA - 650 templated transcription in response to stress ( GO : 0043620 ; ZnO2 p - value 0 . 010266263 ) , 651 positive regulation of cytoplasmic mRNA processing body assembly ( GO : 0010606 ; ZnO2 p - 652 value 0 . 010266263 ) , negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter 653 ( GO : 0000122 ; ZnO2 p - value 0 . 024209881 ) , regulation of translational initiation 654 ( GO : 0006446 ; ZnO2 p - value 0 . 030648445 ) , and histone deacetylation ( GO : 0016575 ; ZnO2 p - 655 value 0 . 039595812 ) specifically observed to be upregulated in ZnO2 NPs . Similarly in case of 656 SWCNT the enriched terms related to transcription includes regulation of sequence - specific 657 DNA binding transcription factor activity ( GO : 0051090 ; SWCNT10 p - value 3 . 59E - 04 ) , 658 covalent chromatin modification ( GO : 0016569 ; SWCNT10 p - value 0 . 001780004 ) , 659 transcription , DNA - templated ( GO : 0006351 ; SWCNT10 p - value 0 . 004554925 ) , chromatin 660 remodelling ( GO : 0006338 ; SWCNT10 p - value 0 . 009144073 ) , posttranscriptional regulation 661 of gene expression ( GO : 0010608 ; SWCNT10 p - value 0 . 010799581 ) , regulation of mRNA 662 stability ( GO : 0043488 ; SWCNT10 p - value 0 . 031509087 ) , and histone deacetylation 663 ( GO : 0016575 ; SWCNT10 0 . 044248664 ) . 664 665 31 Ribonuclease specific to Poly ( A ) tail , PARN ( ZnO2 FC : 4 . 1 , SWCNT10 FC : 5 . 2 ) was 666 upregulated that is responsible for efficient degradation of mRNA poly ( A ) tails and found that 667 PARN is also a crucial player , accountable for regulating the dynamics of poly ( A ) during the 668 DNA damage processes ( Cevher et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , our results indicate the silencing or 669 degradation of aberrant mRNAs during the stress condition . In the same context , the 670 upregulation of major subunits of the CCR4 - NOT complex ( major deadenylase ) , i . e . , CNOT1 671 ( ZnO2 FC : 3 . 05 , SWCNT10 FC : 2 . 09 ) and CNOT6 ( ZnO2 FC : 7 . 2 , SWCNT10 FC : 9 . 57 ) was 672 also observed . CNOT1 maintains cell viability by maintaining the levels of translatable mRNA 673 that , in turn , prevents the overproduction of proteins and ultimately prevents the unfolded 674 protein response ( Ito et al . , 2011 ) . CNOT6 ( ZnO2 FC : 7 . 2 , SWCNT10 FC : 9 . 57 ) also contains 675 cell senescence and is vital for efficient cell proliferation ( Mittal et al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore , we 676 observed that NPs could alter the expression of genes related to chromatin remodelling 677 ( GO : 0006338 ) that controls epigenetic mechanisms in the cell ( Sierra et al . , 2016 ) . 678 679 The results of toxicity assays showed that NPs are responsible for DNA damage and proved in 680 transcriptomics results discussed in the previous section . To counteract the defence mechanism , 681 our data show that cells upregulate various chromatin remodellers such as INO80 ( ZnO2 FC : 682 3 . 4 , SWCNT10 FC : 3 . 5 ) to modify the nucleosomes in such a way that different repair proteins 683 can gain access to the damaged sites on the DNA ( Attikum et al . , 2004 6 ; Morrison et al . , 2004 ) . 684 Thus , NPs alter chromatin - based transcriptional machinery to regulate the cellular processes 685 under changing cellular environments . We found AJUBA ( ZP 3 . 6 , SM 3 . 4 ) , which is 686 responsible for HDAC ( ZnO2 FC : 2 . 3 SWCNT10 FC : 1 . 6 ) dependent corepressor activity and 687 negative regulator of the Hippo signalling pathway ( Ayyanathan et al . , 2007 ; Thakur et al . , 688 2010 ) . AJUBA is also identified to regulate cell - cell adhesion formation and affect cell growth 689 and fate ( Marie et al . , 2003 ) . 690 32 691 Another interesting finding is the downregulation of the Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A 692 ( HNF1A ; ZnO2 FC : - 11 . 8 , SWCNT10 FC : - 11 . 5 ) in both the NPs treatment . It is a major 693 hepatic transcription factor responsible for regulating vital processes , majorly involved in 694 glucose , amino acids , lipid , homeostasis , detoxification , bile acids and cholesterol metabolism . 695 Also , the mutation in HNF1A causes maturity - onset diabetes of the young type 3 ( MOYD3 ) , 696 characterised by impaired insulin secretion . The HNF1A knockdown study showed elevated 697 genes related to proliferation and cell cycle control ( Bonzo et al . , 2012 ) . 698 699 In addition , loss of HNF1A activity in liver adenocarcinoma resulted in increased cellular 700 proliferation with an increase in glycolysis , lipogenesis , and other macromolecules that further 701 advantage the growth ( Wang et al . , 2019 ) . However , in our transcriptomics data , we not only 702 found downregulation of HNF1A ( ZnO2 FC : - 11 . 8 , SWCNT10 FC : - 11 . 5 ) but also for other 703 concordant genes , including hepatocyte growth factor activator ( HGFAC , ZnO FC : - 2 . 7 , 704 SWCNT10 FC : - 5 ) and insulin growth factor 2 ( IGF2 , ZnO2 FC : - 12 . 9 , SWCNT10 FC : - 8 . 7 ) , 705 therefore , resulted in the restricted aberrant cellular proliferation upon NPs treatment . Thus , 706 we evident at the molecular level that a low dose of NPs imposes a negative effect on the 707 HepG2 cells , but the regulatory machinery of cells described above functions in a coordinated 708 manner to protect from the toxic insult and enhance the survival rate . 709 710 The highly upregulated gene in the category related to transcription ( GO : 0006351 ) is FHL2 711 ( ZnO2 FC : 15 . 5 , SWCNT10 FC : 13 . 3 ) that exerts its effect on transcription by showing its 712 inhibitory impact on E4F1 , a cell cycle repressor ( Paul et al . , 2006 ) . The major suppressor 713 KAT6B ( ZnO2 FC : 13 . 5 , SWCNT10 FC : 9 . 2 ) gene involved in dynamics of histone H3 714 acetylation is highly expressed in response to NPs that can be a positive regulator of 715 33 transcription ( Champagne et al . , 1999 ) . The upregulation of major gene CACTIN ( ZnO2 FC : 716 12 . 7 , SWCNT10 FC : 12 . 3 ) suggested TLR mediated NF - kB signalling ( Atzie et al . , 2010 ) 717 prevents the inflammatory response during low dose exposure of NPs . The nuclear protein 718 peripherin ( PPHL1 , ZnO2 FC : 12 . 28 , SWCNT10 FC : 11 . 78 ) arrests the cell cycle at S - phase 719 by downregulating the expression of a vital initiation factor of replication cdc7 ( Kurita et al . , 720 2004 ) . 721 722 Serine / threonine kinases are also found to be activated observed in gene ontology category of 723 molecular function ( ZnO2 p - value 0 . 025 , SWCNT10 p - value 1 . 18E - 04 ; TableS3 ) that includes 724 MAPK13 ( ZnO2 FC : 11 . 93 , SWCNT10 FC : 8 . 27 ) phosphorylates variety of proteins and 725 mediates their degradation through proteasomal pathway in stressed conditions ( Pani et al . , 726 2008 ) . Some other important kinases in our data includes ACVR1B ( ZnO2 FC : 6 . 59 , 727 SWCNT10 FC : 6 . 9 ) , CDC42BPA ( ZnO2 FC : 6 . 49 , SWCNT10 FC : 5 . 83 ) CSNK1A1 ( ZnO2 728 FC : 4 . 62 , SWCNT10 FC : 4 . 25 ) CSNK1E ( ZnO2 FC : 14 , SWCNT10 FC : 14 . 48 ) , LIMK2 729 ( ZnO2 FC : 11 . 21 , SWCNT10 FC : 11 . 17 ) , MAP2K3 ( ZnO2 FC : 8 . 99 , SWCNT10 FC : 7 . 68 ) , 730 MAPK13 ( ZnO2 FC : 11 . 93 , SWCNT10 FC : 12 . 7 ) , MAPK3 ( ZnO2 FC : 6 . 64 , SWCNT10 FC : 731 7 . 4 ) , MARK2 ( ZnO2 FC : 9 . 94 , SWCNT10 FC : 9 . 5 ) , MAST2 ( ZnO2 FC : 8 . 75 , SWCNT10 FC : 732 9 . 3 ) NEK2 ( ZnO2 FC : 7 . 5 , SWCNT10 FC : 7 . 4 ) , PAK1 ( ZnO2 FC : 3 . 68 , SWCNT10 FC : 3 . 69 ) , 733 PKN1 ( ZnO2 FC : 7 . 9 , SWCNT10 FC : 3 . 2 ) , RIOK3 ( ZnO2 FC : 11 . 10 , SWCNT10 FC : 12 . 86 ) 734 ( Table S1 ) . Pathway analysis also revealed similar pathways induced by both the NPs that 735 included focal adhesion , MAPK signalling and TNF signalling pathway ( TableS2 ) . Overall , 736 these finding suggest that ZnO2NPs and SWCNT10 significantly affect the transcriptomic 737 profile of HepG2 cells , leading to measurable alternation in behaviour . 738 739 34 3 . 7 . Ubiquitin mediated proteasomal degradation of proteins 740 The NPs shows the concentration - dependent lethality to the cell ; at low concentration , it shows 741 disruption in the cellular machinery by interacting with various biomolecules and proteins 742 inside the cell . The cell always tries to maintain its appropriate environment by targeting 743 misfolded and proteins of DNA repair , apoptosis and many other cellular events . NPs enter 744 inside the cells and interact with various molecules , including proteins , and affect their 745 functioning . Accordingly , the upregulation of different ubiquitin - proteasome genes was 746 observed in response to both the NPs . This activation suggests that NPs are causing harm to 747 the proteins due to which cells come into play to activate its degradative machinery to maintain 748 homeostasis . In other perspectives , this ubiquitination machinery is required for activating and 749 regulating various signalling cascades in a nonproteolytic manner . 750 751 The selective proteolysis of truncated proteins is an essential requirement to maintain the 752 cellular homeostasis mainly regulated by coordinating the ubiquitin - proteasome system ( UPS ) . 753 The ubiquitin is the posttranslational modification that particularly targets the modified 754 proteins to proteasomal complex . Our dataset identified ubiquitination as the highly enriched 755 top ten processes in the represented DEGs ( Table S2 ) . The transcriptomes ' abundances were 756 elevated greater than log 2 3 . 0 fold observed for 24 . 4 % and 52 . 1 % genes in the transcriptomes 757 in presence with SWCNT10 , and ZnO2 NPs , respectively ( Figure 7A ) . The GO functional 758 annotation highlights ubiquitination process for the UPS ( GO : 0070536 ) for SWCNT10 ( P - 759 value 0 . 038 ) , ZnO2 NPs ( P - value 0 . 0024 ) , ( Table S2 ) . 760 761 Also , the proteasome subunits identified were found elevated ( Table S5 ; Figure 7B and C ) . The 762 previous report also identified the increased levels potentially related to proteasome of 6 763 transcripts , PSMB4 , PSMC6 , PSMA6 , PSMC3 , PSMD2 , and PSMA7 , elevated by more than 3 764 35 log2 fold in response to ZnO2 NPs ( Braga et al . , 2014 ) . The enrichment of ubiquitination 765 processes describes the previously reported DNA replication , transcription and cellular iron 766 ion homeostasis were significantly downregulated because NPs increase the protein damage 767 and target them for degradation and suggesting that exposure to NPs treatment could lead to 768 DNA damage and cells are trying to cope up with the damage by activating repair mechanism 769 ( Figure 7 and Table S2 ) . The stability in the cell was maintained through antagonising 770 ubiquitination and deubiquitinating enzymes ( DUBs ) while retaining the structure and function 771 of proteins , protein turnover , DNA damage response and several other signalling pathways . 772 ( He et al . , 2016 , Bhattacharyya et al . , 2014 ) . We found that the NPs show concentration - 773 dependent lethality to the cell ( Figure 1 ) ; in the low concentration , it shows disruption in the 774 cellular machinery by interacting with various biomolecules and proteins inside the cell . 775 However , the HepG2 cell maintains its appropriate environment by targeting misfolded as well 776 as proteins of DNA repair ( GO : 0006281 ; ZnO2 p - value 8 . 81E - 04 , SWCNT10 p - value 1 . 33E - 777 06 ) , apoptosis ( GO : 0042981 ; ZnO2 p - value 0 . 042 , SWCNT10 p - value 0 . 001 ) and many other 778 cellular events as identified in the GO enrichment process . 779 780 Previously , it reported that entry of the NPs ( SWCNT and ZnO ) inside the cells initiates 781 multiple pathways through activating and deactivating various proteins and affects their 782 functioning ( Yadav et al . , 2021 , Mukherjee et al . , 2018 , Wilhelmi et al . , 2013 , Wang et al . , 783 2020 , Ndika et al . , 2018 ) . Accordingly , the upregulation of various ubiquitin - proteasome genes 784 was observed in response to both the NPs ( Figure 7D ) . This activation suggests that NPs are 785 causing harm to the proteins due to which cells come into play to activate its degradative 786 machinery to maintain homeostasis . In other perspectives , this ubiquitination machinery is 787 required for activating and regulating various signalling cascades in a nonproteolytic manner . 788 While many transcriptome profiling studies have revealed differentially regulated genes 789 36 encoding proteolysis - related functions , only minor proportions of these transcripts encoded 790 proteasome subunits . Therefore , this concerted elevation of proteasome subunit transcripts is 791 not a general stress response and may reflect the specific biological effects of these NP types . 792 793 Furthermore , our data suggest that NP induce changes in the ubiquitin - proteasome system . We 794 postulated the schematic presentation of the NPs affecting the cellular process ( Figure 8 ) . 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 Figure 8 : Schematic presentation of the NPs affecting the cellular process 809 It was clear that in association with endocytosis , cytoskeleton remodelling , the protein 810 ubiquitination plays a primary function in cellular homeostasis via apoptosis ( Lee and Peter , 811 2003 ) . Furthermore , the DNA repair mechanism and damage response connection allow the 812 cell to counter interact with the nanoparticles . 813 814 37 4 . Conclusion 815 In summary , we used high - throughput transcriptomics data and a liver cell line as a model 816 system to investigate the molecular mechanism of cytotoxicity of two commonly used NPs , 817 ZnO NPs and SWCNT . Notably , regardless of the form of NPs , low - dose ( without causing 818 major toxic effects ) and acute exposure perturb related mechanistic functions . This pattern of 819 reaction - response revealed that , regardless of NP type , the general stress response system was 820 activated at early time points . The results showed that SWCNT and ZnO NPs reached the cells 821 through clathrin - mediated pathways , consistent with altered cytoskeleton gene expression . The 822 increased ROS levels within the cells may clarify the mediated DNA damage expression , but 823 not enough to cause cell death . The results reveal the cellular response to toxic NPs and the 824 downregulation of cell cycle - related genes . This behaviour is consistent with the findings of a 825 cell viability assay , which showed that cell survival was sustained at > 80 % at low doses and 826 early time points . Finally , we demonstrated that ZnO NPs and SWCNT activate proteasomal 827 genes , causing ubiquitination and degradation of different proteins . 828 829 Acknowledgement 830 The authors would like to thank Director ICAR - NDRI for providing sufficient funds and 831 reagents .
