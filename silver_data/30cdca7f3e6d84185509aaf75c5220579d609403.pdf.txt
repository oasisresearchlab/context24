Introduction The structure of the shape of constant mean curvature compact connected surfaces ( = cmc - surfaces ) with boundary has recently been the focus of investigation for a number of authors . The idea is to describe the shape of a cmc - surface thanks to the knowledge of the geometry of its boundary . Even in the easiest case , in which the boundary consists of a round circle , it is unknown if the spherical caps are the only embedded cmc - surfaces with this boundary ( when the surface is minimal , it is included in the convex hull of its boundary ) . In this paper , we will assume that the cmc - surfaces are not minimal . When the boundary is a convex curve included in a plane P , using the Alexan - drov Reﬂection method [ 1 ] , it proves that if an embedded cmc - surface is over P , it inherits all symmetries of its boundary ( see also [ 3 ] and [ 5 ] ) . Then , in the embedded case , one seeks a geometric hypothesis to assure that the surface is included in one of the halfspaces determined by P . In this sense , the most interesting sufﬁcient condition is given in [ 2 ] : the surface is transverse to P along the boundary . We try to generalize these results when the boundary is not connected . In this paper , we will study embedded cmc - surfaces with two Jordan curves in parallel planes as boundary . So , in Section 2 , we investigate the symmetries of an embedded cmc - surface and the point at which the surface has the same symmetries as its boundary . This section is motivated by the paper of Schoen [ 8 ] . ? This work has been partially supported by a DGICYT Grant No . PB94 - 0796 . 202 R . L´OPEZ Figure 1 . In general , it is interesting to see how the conﬁguration of the boundary is reﬂected in the shape of the surface . From [ 2 ] , the transversality of the surface along the boundary is a natural condition to consider : it means that the surface lies locally around the boundary in one of the halfspaces determined by the planes containing the boundary . Following [ 2 ] , we can pose the following question : given an embedded cmc - surface bounded by two planar Jordan curves in parallel planes and included around its boundary in the slab determined by these planes , does it lie completely in this slab ? Figure 1 shows that the answer is negative : the surface is a piece of a Delaunay surface ( turning the darkened portion of the curve around l ) such that , locally around the boundary , it lies in the slab but the whole surface is not included in the slab . The Delaunay surfaces are known to be obtained by tracing a focus of a conic section which is rolled without slipping along a line l and revolving the resulting curve around that line . In Figure 1 the surface is a nodoid , which is a surface generated by rolling the focus of a hyperbola ( see [ 4 ] for a description of the Delaunay surfaces ) . In Sections 3 and 4 , we study the behaviour of the surface depending on the relation between the boundary and the planes which contain it , in a similar way to [ 5 ] . Throughout this paper , we will consider the following notation . Let P 1 and P 2 be two parallel planes and orthogonal to the x 3 - axis , i . e . , if a = ( 0 ; 0 ; 1 ) , then Pi ? a . Also , we assume that P 1 = fx 3 = c 1 g and P 2 = fx 3 = c 2 g , with c 1 < c 2 . Let (cid:0) 1 and (cid:0) 2 be two Jordan curves such that (cid:0)i (cid:26) Pi , i = 1 ; 2 . We denote by (cid:10)i the domain bounded by (cid:0)i in Pi and ext ( (cid:10)i ) = Pi (cid:0) (cid:10)i the exterior of the domain (cid:10)i in Pi . Also , set Ai the area of (cid:10)i , i = 1 ; 2 . Now , 1 . let P + i = fx 3 > cig and P (cid:0) i = fx 3 < cig be the upper and lower open halfspaces determined by Pi , i = 1 ; 2 ; 2 . let S = P + 1 \ P (cid:0) 2 = fc 1 < x 3 < c 2 g be the slab determined by the planes P 1 and P 2 ; 3 . If J (cid:26) R , let (cid:0) 1 (cid:2) J = fx 2 R 3 ; ( x 1 ; x 2 ; c 1 ) 2 (cid:0) 1 ; x 3 2 Jg . We denote by H the family of embedded cmc - surfaces with boundary (cid:0) 1 [ (cid:0) 2 . SURFACES OF CONSTANT MEAN CURVATURE 203 2 . Symmetries of Embedded CMC - Surfaces In this section we investigate the point at which an embedded cmc - surface with non - connected boundary inherits the symmetries of its boundary . The tool will be the Alexandrov Reﬂection method [ 1 ] . The most interesting case is when the boundary has two components (cid:0) 1 [ (cid:0) 2 that are included in different parallel planes P 1 and P 2 . There are two possible symmetries : by reﬂection across a plane orthogonal to Pi ( vertical symmetry ) and by reﬂection across a plane parallel to Pi ( horizontal symmetry ) . We will distinguish both cases . THEOREM 2 . 1 ( Vertical symmetry ) . Let (cid:6) 2 H and included in the slab S . Let (cid:5) be a plane orthogonal to Pi and such that (cid:0) 1 [ (cid:0) 2 is invariant under reﬂection through (cid:5) . Assume moreover that each piece of (cid:0)i determined by (cid:5) is a graph over (cid:5) . Then (cid:5) is a plane of symmetry of (cid:6) . Moreover , the part of (cid:6) on either side of (cid:5) is a graph over (cid:5) . So , if (cid:0)i are two concentric circles , the surface is a piece of a Delaunay surface . Proof . By hypothesis , we deﬁne a closed embedded surface F in the following way : F = (cid:6) [ (cid:10) 1 [ (cid:10) 2 : Set W the interior domain of R 3 bounded by F and we choose a unit normal vector ﬁeld to F pointing into W . After a change of coordinates , we suppose that the vectorial plane (cid:5) is generated by the vectors ( 1 ; 0 ; 0 ) and a = ( 0 ; 0 ; 1 ) . Consider the vertical planes (cid:5) ( t ) = fx 2 = tg . If A (cid:26) R 3 , we deﬁne At + = A \ fx 2 > tg and A (cid:3) t + the reﬂection of At + across the plane (cid:5) ( t ) . If A ; B (cid:26) R 3 , we say that A (cid:21) B if for any x 2 A , y 2 B , such that xi = yi for i = 1 ; 3 , then x 2 (cid:21) y 2 . In the same way , we deﬁne At (cid:0) and A (cid:3) t (cid:0) . Take a large real number t > 0 to get (cid:6) \ (cid:5) ( t ) = ; ( it is possible because (cid:6) is compact ) . Now we move (cid:5) ( t ) as t ! 0 to touch to (cid:6) in some time (cid:22) t > 0 . At this point , we can move (cid:5) ( (cid:22) t ) to the left such that (cid:6) (cid:3) ( (cid:22)t(cid:0)(cid:14) ) + is included in W for small (cid:14) > 0 . Because W is bounded , we follow reﬂecting (cid:6) along vertical planes to get , for the ﬁrst time , t 0 (cid:21) 0 such that (cid:6) (cid:3) t 0 + (cid:26) W but (cid:6) (cid:3) t + 6(cid:26) W for t < t 0 . If between (cid:6) (cid:3) t + 0 and (cid:6)t 0 (cid:0) there is a contact point , then by the maximum principle [ 8 ] and by analiticity , we have (cid:6) (cid:3) t 0 + = (cid:6)t 0 (cid:0) and (cid:5) ( t 0 ) is a plane of symmetry of (cid:6) . Therefore , t 0 = 0 , (cid:5) is a plane of symmetry and (cid:5) divides (cid:6) into two graphs over (cid:5) . In another case , the ﬁrst touching point is a point of the boundary and , because each piece of (cid:0)i determined by (cid:5) is a graph , it occurs when t 0 = 0 and (cid:5) ( t 0 ) = (cid:5) . Then we have two possibilities : 1 . the plane (cid:5) is a plane of symmetry , or 2 . (cid:6) (cid:3) 0 + (cid:21) (cid:6) 0 (cid:0) . In this case , we begin with planes (cid:5) ( t ) for large t < 0 . Then , a similar line of reasoning , reﬂecting (cid:6) (cid:3) t (cid:0) with respect to (cid:5) ( t ) to get the ﬁrst touching point between (cid:6) (cid:3) t (cid:0) and (cid:6)t + , concludes that there is a plane of symmetry (cid:5) ( t 1 ) of (cid:6) and t 1 < 0 : that is impossible . 2 204 R . L´OPEZ With respect to the study of horizontal symmetries , we have : THEOREM 2 . 2 ( Horizontal symmetry ) . Let (cid:6) 2 H such that (cid:6) \ ( (cid:0) 1 (cid:2) R ) = (cid:0) 1 [ (cid:0) 2 : If P = fx 3 = cg , where 2 c = c 1 + c 2 , is a plane of symmetry of the boundary , then P is a plane of symmetry of (cid:6) . Moreover , the part of (cid:6) over P is a graph on P . Proof . Now we consider the Alexandrov Reﬂection method by planes parallel to Pi and the closed embedded surface F = (cid:6) [ ( (cid:0) 1 (cid:2) [ c 1 ; c 2 ] ) : We orient F by the unit normal vector ﬁeld pointing towards the interior domain W . We deﬁne (cid:5) ( t ) = fx 3 = tg and if A (cid:26) R 3 , let At + = A \ fx 3 > tg , At (cid:0) = A \ fx 3 < tg and A (cid:3) t + the reﬂection of At + with respect to the plane (cid:5) ( t ) . Also , if A ; B (cid:26) R 3 , we say that A (cid:21) B if for x 2 A , y 2 B , xi = yi , i = 1 ; 2 , then x 3 (cid:21) y 3 . We begin with (cid:5) ( t ) for large t > 0 to get (cid:6) \ (cid:5) ( t ) = ; . We move down (cid:5) ( t ) until the ﬁrst touching point with (cid:6) in a height (cid:22) t (cid:21) c 2 . For small (cid:14) > 0 , (cid:6) (cid:3) ( (cid:22)t(cid:0)(cid:14) ) + (cid:26) W . For t < (cid:22) t , we continue reﬂecting (cid:6) across (cid:5) ( t ) to have the ﬁrst height t 0 (cid:21) c such that (cid:6) (cid:3) t + 0 (cid:26) W but (cid:6) (cid:3) t + 6(cid:26) W for t < t 0 . If there is a contact point between (cid:6) (cid:3) t + 0 and (cid:6)t (cid:0) 0 then (cid:5) ( t 0 ) is a plane of symmetry of (cid:6) ( by maximum principle and analiticity ) . Then t 0 = c and (cid:5) ( t 0 ) = (cid:5) . In another case , the ﬁrst point of contact cannot come between an interior point with a boundary point , thanks to the hypothesis (cid:6) \ ( (cid:0) 1 (cid:2) R ) = (cid:0) 1 [ (cid:0) 2 . Then this point is a point of contact between two boundary points and then t 0 = c . Now we have two cases : (cid:5) is a plane of symmetry of (cid:6) and the proof is completed or (cid:6) (cid:3) c + (cid:21) (cid:6)c (cid:0) . In this case , we consider the same reasoning but with plane (cid:5) ( t ) and t < c 1 . Then we conclude that t 1 < c such that (cid:5) ( t 1 ) is a plane of symmetry of (cid:6) , but this is impossible because the boundary is invariant by the plane (cid:5) ( c ) and c > t 1 . 2 3 . CMC - Surfaces Do Not Intersect ext ( (cid:10)i ) Following the ideas of [ 5 ] we study the embedded cmc - surfaces which only inter - sect the planes Pi in the domain (cid:10)i , i = 1 ; 2 and we will obtain a hypothesis to assure that a surface of H is completely included in the slab determined by the planes P 1 and P 2 . We will prove the following : THEOREM 3 . 1 . Let (cid:6) 2 H with constant mean curvature H and such that (cid:6) \ ext ( (cid:10) 1 ) = (cid:6) \ ext ( (cid:10) 2 ) = ; : SURFACES OF CONSTANT MEAN CURVATURE 205 If the distance between the planes P 1 and P 2 is greater than 1 = jHj , then (cid:6) lies completely in S . Proof . Suppose that (cid:6) \ ( R 3 (cid:0) S ) 6 = ; , for instance , (cid:6) \ P + 2 6 = ; . We obtain a large halfsphere F 2 (cid:26) P + 2 with boundary in P 2 such that the surface (cid:6) \ P + 2 lies in the interior of this halfsphere . In the same way , we choose a halfsphere F 1 (cid:26) P (cid:0) 1 with boundary in P (cid:0) 1 which contains (cid:6) \ P (cid:0) 1 in its interior . We call Ei the bounded domain determined by @ Fi in Pi . Deﬁne the following embedded closed surface : F = (cid:6) [ ( F 1 [ F 2 ) [ ( E 1 \ ext ( (cid:10) 1 ) ) [ ( E 2 \ ext ( (cid:10) 2 ) ) : Let W be the bounded domain by F in R 3 . We orient F to get positive mean curvature H on (cid:6) and let N be the Gauss map in (cid:6) . Since (cid:6) \ P + 2 6 = ; , the highest point with respect to the direction a is an interior point of (cid:6) . At this point , N points down ( by the Hopf maximum principle ) and then points outwards of W . Consider C a not bounded cylinder of radius 1 = 2 H with axis parallel to the planes Pi and included in S . We note that it is possible to introduce it in S thanks to the hypothesis of separation between the planes P 1 and P 2 . We orient the cylinder such that the normal vector ﬁeld NC points inside the cylinder and then the mean curvature of the cylinder is H . By comparison with (cid:6) , we take C inside S so far that it does not intersect the surface (cid:6) . We move parallel with Pi towards (cid:6) until the ﬁrst contact point p . This point is not a boundary point and then p is an interior point in (cid:6) and in C . Because NC ( p ) and N ( p ) agree ( NC ( p ) points outwards of W and the interior of the cylinder is contained in R 3 (cid:0) W ) , (cid:6) and C have to agree in a neighbourhood of p and by analiticity , the surfaces coincide , which is a contradiction . 2 Remark . As consequence of the proof , we have also shown that (cid:6) \ (cid:10)i = ; , for i = 1 ; 2 . If the boundary consists of two circles , we obtain from Theorem 2 . 1 : Let (cid:0) 1 and (cid:0) 2 be two concentric circles in parallel planes . Let (cid:6) be a surface of H with mean curvature H > 0 . If (cid:6) \ ext ( (cid:10)i ) = ; and the distance between the two planes is bigger than 1 = H , then the (cid:6) is a surface of revolution . In particular , it is a Delaunay surface . There are embedded cmc - surfaces which do not intersect ext ( (cid:10)i ) , but they are not included in S : see Figure 1 . We study two special families of surfaces not inter - secting ext ( (cid:10)i ) . First , we recall a “ﬂux formula” for cmc - surfaces due to Kusner [ 6 ] ( see also [ 2 ] and [ 7 ] ) : LEMMA 3 . 2 ( Balancing formula ) . Given an embedded cmc - surface (cid:6) with bound - ary , we have 2 H ZD h(cid:17)D ; ai = Z @ (cid:6) h(cid:23) ; ai ; 206 R . L´OPEZ where H > 0 is the mean curvature of (cid:6) , (cid:23) is the interior conormal along @ (cid:6) , D is a 2 - chain with @ D = @ (cid:6) and (cid:17)D is the unit normal vector ﬁeld to D . The orientation of (cid:17)D comes from the orientation of the cycle (cid:6) [ D when (cid:6) is oriented by its mean curvature vector . PROPOSITION 3 . 3 . Let (cid:6) 2 H such that (cid:6) \ ext ( (cid:10)i ) = ; , i = 1 ; 2 . If the surface lies included in P + i around (cid:0)i , i = 1 ; 2 , then A 1 < A 2 . Proof . We choose the Gauss map N to have H > 0 . With the same notation as Theorem 3 . 1 , the normal N points outwards of W . In the balancing formula we choose D = (cid:10) 1 [ (cid:10) 2 . Then (cid:17)(cid:10) 1 = (cid:0)a and (cid:17)(cid:10) 2 = a . Therefore , 2 H ( (cid:0)A 1 + A 2 ) = Z @ (cid:6) h(cid:23) ; ai (cid:21) 0 and A 1 (cid:20) A 2 . Now we see that A 1 = A 2 is impossible . If A 1 = A 2 , then h(cid:23) ; ai (cid:17) 0 along the boundary . Let (cid:6) 0 be the component of (cid:6) \ P + 2 which contains (cid:0) 2 . Since @ (cid:6) 0 (cid:0)(cid:0) 2 6 = ; is a ﬁnite number of Jordan curves , this component , with a subdomain of (cid:10) 2 , determines in R 3 an interior domain . Comparing (cid:6) 0 with spheres of radius 1 = H below P 2 , the maximum principle concludes that (cid:23) points to ext ( (cid:10) 2 ) . We use the Alexandrov Reﬂection method [ 1 ] with orthogonal planes to P 2 as proof of Theorem 2 . 1 ( we note that P 2 is the tangent plane in any point of (cid:0) 2 ) . If the ﬁrst intersection point is interior , then it is a contact point and the plane is a plane of symmetry of the surface (cid:6) 0 . Then @ (cid:6) 0 \ P 2 = (cid:0) 2 and that is impossible . If the point is in the boundary , the tangent planes agree ( since (cid:23) points to ext ( (cid:10) 2 ) ) and then it is a contact point . Then this plane is also a plane of symmetry and the contact point belongs to (cid:0) 2 . Again , @ (cid:6) 0 \ P 2 = (cid:0) 2 , which is a contradiction . 2 When an embedded cmc - surface lies locally included in the slab determined by the two boundary planes , we have PROPOSITION 3 . 4 . Let (cid:6) 2 H , where (cid:0) 1 is a convex curve and (cid:0) 2 is a vertical translation ( upwards ) of (cid:0) 1 . We suppose that (cid:6) lies in the slab S in a neighbourhood of (cid:0) 1 [ (cid:0) 2 . If (cid:6) \ ext ( (cid:10) 1 ) = (cid:6) \ ext ( (cid:10) 2 ) = ; , then ( a ) (cid:6) (cid:26) S , or ( b ) (cid:6) lies in the solid vertical cylinder determined by (cid:0) 1 , and is symmetric with respect to the plane P = fx 3 = ( c 1 + c 2 ) = 2 g and the two pieces of (cid:6) determined by P are graphs on P . Proof . If (cid:6) 6(cid:26) S , from the Remark of Theorem 3 . 1 , we obtain a surface not completely included in S . Then we suppose for instance that (cid:6) \ P + 2 6 = ; . Following the proof of Theorem 3 . 1 , if we orient (cid:6) to get H > 0 , the Gauss map points out of W . With similar reasoning and considering pieces of not bounded cylinders of radius 1 = 2 H with axis parallel to Pi and included in S , we can prove that the subset of (cid:6) in the slab S is contained in the solid right cylinder (cid:10) 1 (cid:2) R . Then (cid:6) \ ( (cid:0) 1 (cid:2) [ c 1 ; c 2 ] ) = (cid:0) 1 [ (cid:0) 2 . SURFACES OF CONSTANT MEAN CURVATURE 207 Figure 2 . Now we prove that (cid:6) \ P + 2 and (cid:6) \ P (cid:0) 1 are contained in (cid:10) 1 (cid:2) R . For that , we prove that these subsets are graphs on domains in (cid:10) 1 and (cid:10) 2 . We take the balancing formula D = (cid:10) 1 [ (cid:10) 2 . Because (cid:17)(cid:10) 2 = a and (cid:17)(cid:10) 1 = (cid:0)a , the projection of N on Pi along @ (cid:6) points to ext ( (cid:10)i ) . Applying the Alexandrov Reﬂection technique with planes parallel to Pi coming from x 3 = 1 , as in Theorem 2 . 2 , if the ﬁrst touching point occurs between a point of (cid:6)(cid:0) @ (cid:6) and (cid:0) 2 , the segment joining both points is out of W . However , it is impossible with the fact that (cid:17)(cid:10) 2 = a and the surface lying below P 2 around (cid:0) 2 . Therefore , the part of (cid:6) above P 2 is a graph over (cid:10) 2 . In a similar way , (cid:6) \ P (cid:0) 1 is also a graph on (cid:10) 1 . The other statements are a consequence of Theorem 2 . 2 . 2 4 . Special Types of CMC - Surfaces We denote by O (cid:26) H the family of surfaces (cid:6) such that (cid:6) \ ext ( (cid:10) 1 ) = (cid:6) \ (cid:10) 2 = ; : Examples of these surfaces are : 1 . Graphs on bounded annulus (cid:10) (cid:26) P 1 ( Figure 2 ) , where p ( (cid:0) 2 ) (cid:26) (cid:10) 1 and p is the orthogonal projection on P 1 . 2 . Pieces of Delaunay surfaces which appear to intersect with orthogonal planes to the rotation axis . If the surface is a nodoid , it gets the following remarks : ( a ) There are surfaces which lie locally in P + i along the boundary . Moreover , p ( (cid:0) 2 ) (cid:26) (cid:10) 1 ( Figure 2 ) . ( b ) There are examples of pieces of nodoids where h(cid:23) ; ai (cid:17) 0 in (cid:0)i and p ( (cid:0) 2 ) = (cid:0) 1 ( Figure 3 ) . Consider a large halfsphere F 1 such that @ F 1 (cid:26) P 1 and F 1 (cid:26) P (cid:0) 1 to have (cid:6) \ P (cid:0) 1 included in the domain determined by F 1 [ P 1 . Let E 1 (cid:26) P 1 be the domain bounded by @ F 1 in P 1 . Consider the closed embedded surface F = (cid:6) [ (cid:10) 2 [ F 1 [ ( E 1 \ ext ( (cid:10) 1 ) ) and W the interior domain determined by F . We orient F to get positive mean curvature H > 0 on (cid:6) . 208 R . L´OPEZ Figure 3 . We assume that (cid:6) \ P + 2 6 = ; . At the highest point with respect to the plane P 2 , the Gauss map N of (cid:6) points down . Therefore , N points towards W along (cid:6) . We prove that (cid:6) \ P (cid:0) 1 is empty . In another case , there would be an interior point p 2 (cid:6) (cid:0) @ (cid:6) minimum for the height function with respect to the plane P 1 . However , the maximum principle gives N ( p ) = a and then N ( p ) points outwards of W , which is a contradiction . In the same way , it is shown that if (cid:6) \ P (cid:0) 1 6 = ; , then (cid:6) \ P + 2 is empty . Then we have PROPOSITION 4 . 1 Let (cid:6) 2 O . Then (cid:6) lies completely included in one of the halfspaces P + 1 or P (cid:0) 2 . Figure 3 shows a surface of O included in P + 1 . Let (cid:6) 2 O and assume the surface lies in P + i locally around the boundary . Then (cid:6) \ P + 2 6 = ; and from Proposition 4 . 1 , (cid:6) (cid:26) P + 1 . Therefore , (cid:6) \ (cid:10) 1 = ; . Consider the 2 - chain D = (cid:10) 1 [ (cid:10) 2 where the unit normal vector ﬁeld points inside . Then in the balancing formula (cid:17)(cid:10) 1 = a . Let (cid:0) 1 and (cid:0) 2 be two Jordan curves such that (cid:0) 1 (cid:26) p ( (cid:10) 2 ) and (cid:0) 2 is a convex curve . We use the Alexandrov’s method in the same way as [ 2 ] with the closed surface F = (cid:6) [ (cid:10) 1 [ (cid:10) 2 . The convexity of (cid:0) 2 and the fact of (cid:0) 1 lies in the cylinder orthogonal to Pi determined by (cid:0) 2 imply that (cid:6) \ P 2 does not have nulhomotopic cycles in ext ( (cid:10) 2 ) nor two or more homotopic cycles in ext ( (cid:10) 2 ) to (cid:0) 2 . Since (cid:6) \ ext ( (cid:10) 2 ) is not empty , then (cid:6) \ ext ( (cid:10) 2 ) is exactly a cycle homotopic to (cid:0) 2 . Because H is positive , the Gauss map N of (cid:6) points inside the domain bounded by F . Then (cid:17)(cid:10) 2 = (cid:0)a and the balancing formula gives 2 H ( A 1 (cid:0) A 2 ) = Z @ (cid:6) h(cid:23) ; ai (cid:21) 0 : SURFACES OF CONSTANT MEAN CURVATURE 209 Therefore , A 1 (cid:21) A 2 . Because (cid:0) 1 (cid:26) p ( (cid:10) 2 ) , we have A 1 < A 2 : this is impossi - ble . Now we consider (cid:0) 1 = p ( (cid:0) 2 ) ( as the example of Figure 3 ) . PROPOSITION 4 . 2 . Let (cid:6) 2 O with (cid:0) 1 and (cid:0) 2 as convex curves and (cid:0) 2 as a vertical translation of (cid:0) 1 . We denote by Y the solid cylinder (cid:10) 1 (cid:2) R . If the surface (cid:6) lies locally in the halfspaces P + i , then locally around (cid:0) 2 , (cid:6) (cid:26) Y and locally around (cid:0) 1 , (cid:6) (cid:26) ext ( Y ) . Proof . From the balancing formula , h(cid:23) ; ai (cid:17) 0 . Then locally around (cid:0) 2 , we have (cid:6) (cid:26) Y or (cid:6) (cid:26) ext ( Y ) . In the last case , we take a plane P 2 ( (cid:15) ) = P 2 + (cid:15)a , (cid:15) > 0 , near P 2 and set the annulus (cid:6) ( (cid:15) ) (cid:26) (cid:6) determined by the plane P 2 and P 2 ( (cid:15) ) around (cid:0) 2 . Let @ (cid:6) ( (cid:15) ) = (cid:0) 2 [ (cid:0) 2 ( (cid:15) ) with (cid:0) 2 ( (cid:15) ) (cid:26) P 2 ( (cid:15) ) and let (cid:10) 2 ( (cid:15) ) be the disc determined by (cid:0) 2 ( (cid:15) ) in P 2 ( (cid:15) ) . We apply the balancing formula to (cid:6) ( (cid:15) ) . Since the Gauss map points out of the domain bounded by (cid:6) ( (cid:15) ) [ (cid:10) 2 [ (cid:10) 2 ( (cid:15) ) , we get (cid:17)(cid:10) 2 ( (cid:15) ) = a and (cid:6) ( (cid:15) ) (cid:26) ext ( Y ) . Then 0 < 2 H ( (cid:0)A 2 + A 2 ( (cid:15) ) ) = Z (cid:0) 2 h(cid:23) ; ai + Z (cid:0) 2 ( (cid:15) ) h(cid:23) ; ai = Z (cid:0) 2 ( (cid:15) ) h(cid:23) ; ai ; where A 2 ( (cid:15) ) is the area of (cid:10) 2 ( (cid:15) ) . However , along (cid:0) 2 ( (cid:15) ) , the interior conormal points down and we get a contradiction . Then (cid:6) (cid:26) Y along (cid:0) 2 . The statement about (cid:0) 1 is proved as the ﬁrst one . 2 We can also apply the Reﬂection method for embedded cmc - surfaces bounded by two planar Jordan curves to a planar annulus domain . More precisely , COROLLARY 4 . 3 . Let (cid:10) be a bounded annulus domain in P 1 . Then any (cid:6) 2 H with (cid:6) (cid:26) (cid:10) (cid:2) R and p ( (cid:0) 1 [ (cid:0) 2 ) = @ (cid:10) is a graph over (cid:10) . Moreover , the surface lies included in P + 1 or P (cid:0) 2 . Proof . We can assume that p ( (cid:10) 2 ) (cid:26) (cid:10) 1 and then (cid:6) 2 O . By Proposition 4 . 1 the surface is included in P + 1 or in P (cid:0) 2 . For instance , if (cid:6) (cid:26) P + 1 , the fact that (cid:6) (cid:26) (cid:10) (cid:2) R assures that we can use the Alexandrov Reﬂection method as in The - orem 2 . 2 to conclude that (cid:6) is a graph over P 1 . If (cid:10) 1 (cid:26) p ( (cid:10) 2 ) , the reasoning is similar and it can be concluded that the surface is a graph and included in P (cid:0) 2 . 2 Remark . Analogous results can be obtained 1 . if (cid:6) 2 O and lies in P (cid:0) i locally around the boundary ; 2 . for the family of surfaces (cid:6) of H such that (cid:6) \ ext ( (cid:10) 2 ) = (cid:6) \ (cid:10) 1 = ; .
