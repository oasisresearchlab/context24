However , little is known about the neural and genetic mechanisms underlying creative thinking . Based on a cross - validation based predictive framework , we searched from the whole - brain connectome ( 34 , 716 functional connectivities ) and whole genome data ( 309 , 996 SNPs ) in two datasets ( all collected by Southwest University , Chongqing ) consisting of altogether 236 subjects , for a better understanding of the brain and genetic underpinning of creativity . Using the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking score , we found that high ﬁ gural creativity is mainly related to high functional connectivity between the executive control , attention , and memory retrieval networks ( strong top - down effects ) ; and to low functional connectivity between the default mode network , the ventral attention network , and the subcortical and primary sensory networks ( weak bottom - up processing ) in the ﬁ rst dataset ( consisting of 138 subjects ) . High creativity also correlates signi ﬁ cantly with mutations of genes coding for both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters . Combining the brain connectome and the genomic data we can predict individuals ' creativity scores with an accuracy of 78 . 4 % , which is signi ﬁ cantly better than prediction using single modality data ( gene or functional connectivity ) , indicating the importance of combining multi - modality data . Our neuroimaging prediction model built upon the ﬁ rst dataset was cross - validated by a completely new dataset of 98 subjects ( r ¼ 0 . 267 , p ¼ 0 . 0078 ) with an accuracy of 64 . 6 % . In addition , the creativity – related functional connectivity network we identi ﬁ ed in the ﬁ rst dataset was still signi ﬁ cantly correlated with the creativity score in the new dataset ( p < 10 (cid:2) 3 ) . In summary , our research demonstrates that strong top - down control versus weak bottom - up processes underlie creativity , which is modulated by competition between the glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter systems . Our work provides the ﬁ rst insights into both the neural and the genetic bases of creativity . Introduction Creativity in humans is a complex cognitive behavior commonly de ﬁ ned as the ability to generate responses that are novel , useful , and appropriate , ( Sternberg and Lubart , 1996 ) . Creative thinking plays an important role in almost all aspects of our life , most prominently in the arts , science , and engineering . Divergent thinking tests are so far the major type of psychometric instrument in creativity testing ( Gardner , 1988 ; Plucker and Runco , 1998 ) , including various verbal and ﬁ gural tasks . Based on the divergent thinking tests , mounting evidence suggests that the default mode network and brain regions associated with cognitive control may be important for creativity . For example , regions of the default mode network , including the precuneus ( Fink et al . , 2014a , 2014b ; Jauk et al . , 2015 ; Jung et al . , 2010 ; Takeuchi et al . , 2010 ) and inferior parietal lobule ( Takeuchi et al . , 2011 ) , and executive control network ( ECN ) ( Ellamil * Corresponding author .

All rights reserved . NeuroImage 174 ( 2018 ) 164 – 176 et al . , 2012 ; Gonen - Yaacovi et al . , 2013 ) have been implicated in neu - roimaging studies of divergent thinking tasks . The activation of the default mode network ( DMN ) in creative processes may re ﬂ ect the spontaneous generation of candidate ideas , and / or the retrieval of long - term memory ( Beaty et al . , 2016 ) , while the control network may serve to constrain cognition to meet speci ﬁ c goals of the tasks . As a highly complex cognitive process , creativity relies on not only the activity of separate brain regions but also the interactions between different brain regions / networks ( Bullmore and Sporns , 2009 ; Fox et al . , 2005 ; van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol , 2010 ) . Functional connectivity ( FC ) ( the correlation between the BOLD signal of different brain regions ) depicts the interaction between different brain regions , which is infor - mative for complex behaviors such as creativity and cognition . For instance , Beaty et al . ( 2014 ) found greater connectivity between the entire DMN and the left inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ) within the ECN in highly creative individuals . In addition , a recent study found that the strength of connectivity between the DMN and the frontoparietal network ( FPN ) was positively related to both visual and verbal creativity using independent component analysis ( Zhu et al . , 2017 ) . Such ﬁ ndings suggest that creative thought may bene ﬁ t from the cooperation of the DMN and ECN . The genetic basis of divergent thinking has been previously explored mainly by using candidate gene approaches . Several brain regions in the dopaminergic ( DA ) system have been found to be involved in creativity cognition ( Flaherty , 2005 ; Heilman et al . , 2003 ; Takeuchi et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , many genes in the dopamine pathway , like D2 Dopamine Receptor ( DRD2 ) ( de Manzano et al . , 2010 ; Reuter et al . , 2006 ) , D4 Dopamine Receptor ( DRD4 ) ( Mayseless et al . , 2013 ) , Tryptophan Hydroxylase ( TPH1 ) ( Reuter et al . , 2006 ) , Dopamine Transporter 1 ( DAT1 ) , and Catechol - O - Methyltransferase ( COMT ) ( Zabelina et al . , 2016 ) , were selected as candidate genes and were found to be associated with divergent thinking . In addition , as several psychiatric illnesses are found to have genetic links to creativity ( Kyaga et al . , 2011 ; Power et al . , 2015 ) , some genes involved in the pathology of psychosis , such as neuregulin 1 ( NRG1 ) , were selected and were also found to be associated with crea - tivity ( Keri , 2009 ) . Although previous studies have explored the relationship between brain networks and creativity , most studies have focused on the regions previously implicated in creativity ( ROI - based ) , or used correlation analysis , i . e . , correlation between neuroimaging metrics and behavioral scores , to search for the neural basis of creativity ( correlation - based ) . One the one hand , the ROI - based analysis may limit the potential search to only a small part of the whole brain , thus preclude the possibility of new ﬁ ndings ( Xia and He , 2017 ) . On the other hand , correlation - based approaches have the disadvantage of over ﬁ tting the data and often fail to generalize to novel data ( Shen et al . , 2017 ) . In addition , although several studies have explored creativity - related candidate genes , a search for the genetic basis of creativity at a genome - wide scale , especially for divergent thinking , has not been described as far as we know . The correlation - based methods have also been widely employed in the ge - netic analysis of divergent thinking which have the disadvantage of low generalization ability . Based on all the above , in the present study we used a large sample of 236 individuals ( which we separated into two non - overlapping datasets ) in this research , which enabled statistical analyses of whole - brain FCs ( 34 , 716 FCs ) and whole - genome genes ( 309 , 996 SNPs ) that were related to creativity without a priori hypotheses , therefore not creating con - straints on the brain regions and genes to be investigated . Furthermore , we used a cross - validation based approach to identify the functional brain networks that are predictive of creativity , to ensure that the results were statistically ﬁ rm and could be generalized to new populations . Our approach , IMuDP ( Integrating Multi - scale Data for Prediction ) , is improved from one that has been used to predict sustained attention in resting - state fMRI ( Rosenberg et al . , 2016 ) , which can now deal with multi - modal data . The prediction - based approach is held to provide fMRI - derived statistics that relate to individual behaviors with more generalizability than traditional correlation - based analysis ( Dubois and Adolphs , 2016 ) . Furthermore , to understand the genetic underpinning of creative thinking , we also searched from the whole genome the SNPs ( single nucleotide polymorphisms ) whose mutations correlate most closely with the creativity score using the same prediction - based strat - egy . Part of the aim here was to investigate how multi - modal data ( in this case fMRI and genetic data ) can be combined , and whether this helps better predictions to be made . This research provides the ﬁ rst whole - brain functional network analysis for creativity with a corre - sponding whole - genome search for related SNPs , and is aimed to shed light on both the neural and genetic underpinnings of creative thinking . Materials and methods Data Ethics statement Both the behavioral and MRI protocols were approved by the local ethics committee of Southwest China University , Chongqing . Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the study , which was approved by the Institutional Human Participants Review Board of Southwest University Imaging Center for Brain Research . The methods were conducted in accordance with approved guidelines . Participants Three hundred and ﬁ fteen subjects were recruited in this study ( Li et al . , 2016 ) . We ﬁ rstly excluded 63 subjects without complete behav - ioral or other demographic data . After further fMRI head movement control , 236 subjects were retained for further analysis . The retained subjects were then divided into two datasets . The ﬁ rst dataset consisted of 138 individuals , 49 males and 89 females ( age 19 . 7 (cid:3) 1 . 2 ( mean (cid:3) sd ) ) , with both genetic and neuroimaging data , which we used to perform our multimodal prediction analysis . The second dataset consisted of 98 in - dividuals , 38 males and 60 females ( age 20 . 2 (cid:3) 1 . 3 ( mean (cid:3) sd ) ) , with only neuroimaging data , which we used as an external validation dataset to validate our prediction model generated from the ﬁ rst dataset . All the resting - state fMRI data were collected in the Southwest Uni - versity Center for Brain Imaging , Chongqing , China , using a 3 . 0 - T Siemens Trio MRI scanner ( Siemens Medical , Erlangen , Germany ) . Each subject was required not to drink alcohol the day before the experiments , which was then con ﬁ rmed right before the scanning by questionnaires . Resting - state fMRI In resting - state fMRI scanning , the subjects were instructed to rest without thinking about a particular topic , and not to fall asleep or close their eyes . The 8 - min scan of 242 contiguous whole - brain resting - state functional images was obtained using gradient - echo planar imaging ( EPI ) sequences with the following parameters : slices ¼ 32 , repetition time ( TR ) / echo time ( TE ) ¼ 2000 / 30 ms , ﬂ ip angle ¼ 90 , ﬁ eld of view ( FOV ) ¼ 220 mm (cid:4) 220 mm , and thickness / slice gap ¼ 3 / 1 mm , voxel size 3 . 4 (cid:4) 3 . 4 (cid:4) 3 mm 3 . Structural MRI A magnetization - prepared rapid gradient echo ( MPRAGE ) sequence was used to acquire high - resolution T1 - weighted anatomical images ( repetition time ¼ 1900 ms , echo time ¼ 2 . 52 ms , inversion time ¼ 900 ms , ﬂ ip angle ¼ 90 (cid:5) , resolution matrix ¼ 256 (cid:4) 256 , sli - ces ¼ 176 , thickness ¼ 1 . 0 mm , voxel size ¼ 1 (cid:4) 1 (cid:4) 1mm 3 ) . Creativity assessment We adopted the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking ( TTCT ) score that measures divergent thinking , which is a central aspect of creativity Z . Liu et al . NeuroImage 174 ( 2018 ) 164 – 176 165 ( Huang et al . , 2013 ; Sternberg and O ' HARA , 1999 ) . The TTCT contains verbal , ﬁ gural and auditory tests ( Huang et al . , 2013 ) . The Figural TTCT is supposed to be less biased than the verbal TTCT test ( Kim , 2006 ) , and thus is the focus of this paper . The ﬁ gural test comprises of 3 tasks : picture construction , picture completion , and lines . To be speci ﬁ c , all the participants answer the same questions with a 10 - min time limit for each task . The ﬁ rst activity requires subjects to draw a picture based on an ellipse shape provided on the page . The second activity requires subjects to use 10 incomplete ﬁ gures to make an object or picture . The third ac - tivity requires subjects to draw as many as possible pictures or objects on three pages of vertical lines . Participants were told to draw as many as possible and as creatively as possible . For each task the scoring comprised three components : ﬂ uency ( the number of meaningful and relevant responses , which is associated with the ability to generate and consider other possibilities ) , ﬂ exibility ( the number of different categories of responses , which re ﬂ ects the ability to shift between conceptual ﬁ elds ) , and originality ( the degree of originality of the responses , which is associated with thinking “ outside the box ” ) ( Chavez - Eakle et al . , 2007 ) . More speci ﬁ cally , the score of ﬂ uency is the number of meaningful responses , the score of ﬂ exibility is the number of different categories of response , and the score of originality is the degree of originality of the response with a four - point rating scale ranging from 0 ( “ not original ” ) to 3 ( “ highly original ” ) . Three trained raters took part in the scoring . The raters displayed high internal consistency in their ratings ( Cronbach alpha ¼ 0 . 90 ) . The cur - rent study used the total creativity scores ( sum of the ﬂ uency , ﬂ exibility and originality scores ) ( de Souza et al . , 2010 ) for each dimension which was highly correlated with the ﬂ uency , ﬂ exibility and originality scores ( details in Fig . S1 ) on the basis of the ﬁ ndings of Heausler and Thompson ( 1988 ) , who suggested that because of the high correlations between the three subscales of the TTCT the subscales do not provide meaningfully different data ( Heausler and Thompson , 1988 ) . General intelligence assessment The participants ' intellectual ability was examined using the Com - bined Raven ' s Test ( CRT ) . As the test is a highly reliable and valid in - telligence test , it is widely used ( Tang et al . , 2012 ) . In our study , all the 138 participants completed the test with the 72 items , including the Raven ' s standard progressive matrix ( C , D , E sets ) and Raven ' s colored progressive matrix ( A , AB , B sets ) , revised by the Psychology Department of East China Normal University in 1989 . The total number of correct answers that an individual presented in 40 min was used as a psycho - metric index of individual intelligence ( Jaeggi et al . , 2008 ) . Genotyping Among all the participants in our study , 138 individuals were geno - typed by using the DNA samples extracted from their whole blood . For each sample , approximately 200 ng of genomic DNA was used to geno - type on the Human Omni - Zhonghua chips ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) . We processed all the samples following the Illumina In ﬁ nium assay manual . Our main processing procedure are as follows : ﬁ rstly , each sample was ampli ﬁ ed , fragment , precipitated , and resuspended in a well - designed hybridization buffer . Hybridization of the denatured samples were done on the Human Omni - Zhonghua chip for at least 16 h at 48 (cid:5) C ; Then , the beadchips were processed for the single - base extension reac - tion , stained , and imaged on the iScan Reader ( Illumina , Inc . ) , The iScan employs a laser to excite the red and green ﬂ uorophores and a laser - scanner to recode the high - resolution images of the light emitted by the excited ﬂ uorophores . Next , the GenomeStudio software genotyping module ( Illumina , Inc . ) was used to analyze the raw intensity data ( ‘ idat ’ ﬁ le ) that was transformed from the high - resolution images . It trans - formed the raw intensity data to the normalized bead intensity data and then converted the normalized intensity data into SNP genotypes . Finally , only SNPs that were genotyped in more than 98 % of samples from the 138 subjects were retained . Method FMRI data preprocessing All fMRI data were preprocessed using SPM8 ( http : / / www . ﬁ l . ion . ucl . ac . uk / spm ) and the Data Processing Assistant for Resting - State fMRI ( DPARSF ) ( Chao - Gan and Yu - Feng , 2010 ) . We ﬁ rst discarded the ﬁ rst 10 EPI scans to suppress the equilibration effects and the remaining scans were slice timing corrected , realigned and normalized to a standard template ( Montreal Neurological Institute ) based on T1 images using linear transformation and resampled to 3 (cid:4) 3 (cid:4) 3 mm 3 . Next , spatial smoothing ( 8 mm Full Width Half Maximum FWHM ) , band - pass tem - poral ﬁ ltering ( 0 . 01 – 0 . 1 Hz ) , nuisance signal removal from the ventricles and deep white matter , global mean signal removal , and 24 head motion correction parameters ( Friston et al . , 1996 ) were involved to remove the sources of spurious correlations . We also implemented additional careful volume censoring ( “ scrubbing ” ) movement correction suggested by Power et al . ( Power et al . , 2014 ) to remove the head - motion artifacts . The mean framewise displacement ( FD ) was computed with FD threshold for displacement being 0 . 2 mm . In addition to the frame corresponding to the displaced time point , 1 preceding and 2 succeeding time points were also deleted to reduce the ‘ spill - over ’ effect of head movements . Subjects with > 10 % displaced frames ﬂ agged were excluded from the analysis as it is likely that such high - level of movement would have had an in ﬂ uence on several volumes . SNP quality control Single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) with call rate < 95 % , minor allele frequency < 5 % , or deviation from the Hardy - Weinberg equilib - rium with p < 10 (cid:2) 6 , were excluded from the analysis . Individual samples showing an over - or under abundance of heterozygosity ( > 5 s d from the mean ) were excluded from the subsequent analysis . In order to prevent collinearity between SNPs , we further excluded SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium ( R 2 > 0 : 9 ) within a window of 50 kb using the – indep command implemented in PLINK . Finally , after quality control , we ob - tained 309 , 996 SNPs in the 138 participates . Whole - brain functional network construction A 264 putative functional area template that Power and colleagues de ﬁ ned was used to identify nodes in the whole - brain network ( Power et al . , 2011 ) . Their 264 - region network de ﬁ nition has been shown to perform better than the 90 - parcel AAL atlas and voxel - based graph in representing some aspects of the functional organization of the brain with fMRI data ( Power et al . , 2011 ) . The 264 regional time series were extracted by averaging voxel time series within each ROI . Then , for each subject , the Pearson cross - correlation between all pairs of regional BOLD signals was calculated to re ﬂ ect the FC between region pairs . A brain network consisting of the 264 brain regions and 34 , 716 FCs that con - nected them was constructed . Creativity - related functional brain network strength We used a procedure similar to that presented by Rosenberg et al . ( Rosenberg et al . , 2016 ) to construct the functional brain network closely related to the TTCT ﬁ gural score and then calculate the network strength . We ﬁ rst calculated the Pearson correlation between each of the 34 , 716 ( in the 264 nodes network ) FCs and the score with the age , sex , and the Raven ' s score being covariates of interest across all subjects . Then , the functional connectivities whose p - value was smaller than a prede ﬁ ned threshold ( p threshold ) were selected , which were further separated into those with FCs positively - related and negatively - related to the ﬁ gural TTCT score . Since these individual FC always share common nodes ( brain regions ) , we call a set of such connectivity links a network . For example , Z . Liu et al . NeuroImage 174 ( 2018 ) 164 – 176 166 the functional connectivities that were signi ﬁ cantly pos - itively / negatively related to the TTCT score comprise the positively - related / negatively - related network , and all FCs that were signi ﬁ cantly related to the ﬁ gural TTCT score comprise the overall network . The sum of all FCs in the corresponding networks was de ﬁ ned as the network strength . Creativity - related polygenic alliance In order to identify SNPs that were signi ﬁ cantly related to the TTCT score , we used a linear regression model with the TTCT score being the phenotype and age , sex and the Raven ' s score as covariates . Similar to the identi ﬁ cation of the creativity - related functional brain network , we chose SNPs whose mutations correlated with the TTCT score signi ﬁ cantly ( p - value smaller than the p threshold ) , and then divided them into the positive and the negative group ( according to their correlation with the TTCT score ) . Then , the sum of the mutation states ( 0 , 1 , 2 ) of all the SNPs in the positively - related polygenic alliance , negative - related polygenic alliance , and the whole polygenic alliance , were de ﬁ ned as the mutation strengths , respectively . Predicting creativity by brain connectome or genome A leave - one - out cross - validation approach was then adopted to pre - dict the TTCT score of novel individuals , as follows , using the network strength of the creativity - related brain networks or the mutation strength of the polygenic alliances and other covariances as predictors ( see Fig . 1 for details ) . For each modality of data , we changed the p threshold ( 0 . 0001 , 0 . 0005 , and 0 . 001 to 0 . 01 with a step of 0 . 0005 ) . For a given p threshold , we per - formed the leave - one - out cross - validation approach n times ( n ¼ number of subjects ) , each time with one subject being the test set , and the rest of the subjects were used to construct the creativity - related brain networks or the polygenic alliances . The creativity - related network strength or the mutation strength were calculated for individuals in the training set and then fed into the linear regression models for prediction . We used four kinds of prediction model with 1 . the positive network / mutation strength , 2 . negative network / mutation strength , 3 . overall network / mutation strength and 4 . the positive network / mutation strength and the negative / mutation strength , being used respectively in each model . The age , sex , and the Raven ' s score were included in all the four models as covariance terms . Then , the remaining test subject , who was not used in the construction of the prediction models , was employed to test all 4 models to achieve the best prediction of the TTCT score . The goodness of prediction was assessed by the correlation between the predicted and real TTCT score . The optimal p threshold and ﬁ nal regression model were the ones with the best prediction . Prediction of TTCT score combining multi - modal data After we determined the optimal model and p threshold for prediction of creativity for the neuroimaging and genetic data , respectively , we then combined these two modalities using the elastic net linear regression model to predict the creativity score of individuals ( Zou and Hastie , 2005 ) . The elastic regression model was used here because the neuro - imaging and genetic data may be highly correlated . This model involved the network strength , the mutation strength , age , sex and the Raven ' s score as predictors . The network strength and the mutation strength were determined by the optimal prediction model identi ﬁ ed in single modality data . The details of the regression model we used are as follows : Y ¼ β 0 þ X i β 1 i S i þ X j β 2 j T j þ X k β 3 k C k þ ε ( 1 ) where Y is the TTCT ﬁ gural score , S i is the ith network strength we used in the best brain connectome prediction model , T j is the jth mutation strength we used in the best genome prediction model , C k is the kth covariance ( age , sex or Raven ' s score ) , ε is the noise term , and β 0 ; β 1 i ; and β 2 j are determined by the elastic - net approach that solves the following problem : min β 1 2 ð N (cid:2) 1 Þ X N (cid:2) 1 n ¼ 1 y ð n Þ (cid:2) β 0 (cid:2) X i β 1 i s ð n Þ i (cid:2) X j β 2 j t ð n Þ j (cid:2) X j β 3 j c ð n Þ j ! 2 þ λ P α ð β Þ ! ( 2 ) where N is the number of samples , y ( n ) , s ( n ) , t ( n ) and c ( n ) represent the TTCT score , the network strength , the mutation strength and the covariance of the nth sample , β ¼ ð β 0 ; β 11 ; ⋯ ; β 21 ; ⋯ ; β 31 ; ⋯ Þ P α ð β Þ ¼ X k ¼ 0 ; 11 ; ⋯ 21 ; ⋯ 31 ; ⋯ (cid:2) ð 1 (cid:2) α Þ 2 β 2 k þ α j β k j (cid:3) ( 3 ) Finally , a leave - one - out procedure was performed again to determine the optimal α and λ ( searching in [ 0 , 1 ] with a step of 0 . 01 ) with maximal correlation between the predicted TTCT score and the real TTCT . The ﬁ nal α that we used was 0 . 80 and the ﬁ nal λ was 0 . 66 . Permutation analysis To determine whether the prediction result is signi ﬁ cantly better than random , a non - parametric permutation analysis was performed . As our prediction pipeline needs hours to run , a very large number of permu - tations time was not realizable . So , we randomly shuf ﬂ ed the TTCT scores across all the 138 individuals 1000 times and ran our prediction pipeline for each permutation run . The null distribution for the correla - tion between the predicted scores and the real scores was obtained . Then , based on the null distribution , the p value of our prediction result was obtained . Identi ﬁ cation of the shared creativity network and polygenic alliance underlying creativity In the leave - one - out prediction of the creativity score , each trial had identi ﬁ ed a different set of FCs or SNPs . To ﬁ nd the FCs or SNPs that were shared among all individuals , we selected those FCs or SNPs that appeared in each leave - one - out trial . As these FCs and SNPs are related to creativity across all individuals , they may be closely related to the creativity score . Further , the Pearson correlations between the TTCT score , the network strength of the shared creativity network , and the mutation strength of the shared polygenic score , were also calculated with the age , sex and the Raven ' s score as the covariance terms . Independent validation : using the shared creativity network We used the second dataset that consisted of 98 individuals with only fMRI data to validate our imaging prediction model . First , using all the 138 samples in group 1 , a linear model for the TTCT score was con - structed , using the network strength of the shared creativity network , sex , age , and Raven ' s score ( This network consists of links that we identi ﬁ ed that were signi ﬁ cantly correlated with the creativity and shared among all individuals by our predictive framework ) . Then , for each of the 98 individuals in group 2 the network strength ( i . e . the sum of the functional connectivities of the links ) of the shared creativity network identi ﬁ ed in group 1 , with their sex , age , and Raven ' s score , were fed into the linear model to predict the TTCT score of each individual in group 2 . The Pearson correlation between the real TTCT scores and the predicted TTCT scores was calculated for individuals in group 2 to indicate the generalizability of our prediction model and its signi ﬁ cance was deter - mined by performing non - parametric permutation analysis .

Step 1 : Data preprocessing : A functional network with 264 nodes is constructed with the resting state fMRI data for each individual . Different colors represent the node in different networks such as the DMN and control network etc . Whole genome SNPs were also identi ﬁ ed for each individual . Step 2 : TTCT creativity score prediction by unimodal data . ( a ) First we set a threshold of p values for the correlation between functional connectivity / mutations of SNPS and TTCT score , and only FCs or SNPs with p < p threshold are selected . ( b ) We then use a linear regression model and leave - one - out paradigm to predict TTCT score of each individual . We change p threshold to select the optimal one ( p _ opt ) that achieves the best prediction . Step 3 : TTCT creativity score prediction by multimodal data . We integrate fMRI and genome data in an elastic network in predicting the TTCT score , using the optimal p threshold identi ﬁ ed in Step 2 . Results : ( a ) shows the correlation between the Shared networks , shared SNPs , and TTCT score obtained in Step 2 and ( b ) shows the correlation between the predicted TTCT score and real score of the individuals . Z . Liu et al . NeuroImage 174 ( 2018 ) 164 – 176 168 Results Prediction of the TTCT ﬁ gural score Using the whole brain functional connectome , the correlation be - tween the TTCT score predicted by the optimal prediction model with the real TTCT score was 0 . 424 ( p ¼ 2 : 19 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 7 , Fig . 2a ) . With whole genome data , the correlation between the predicted and real TTCT score was 0 . 466 ( p ¼ 8 : 70 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 9 , Fig . 2a ) . The mean absolute percentage errors ( MAPE ) of the two prediction models were 23 . 9 % and 22 . 5 % , respectively ( 76 . 1 % and 77 . 5 % in terms of accuracy ) . With combined neuroimaging and genomic data , the correlation between the predicted TTCT score and the real TTCT score increased to 0 . 524 ( p ¼ 4 : 33 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 11 ) , with the MAPE of the model being 21 . 6 % ( 78 . 4 % in terms of accuracy ) , see Fig . 2b . The absolute prediction error of the model that combined neuroimaging and genomic data is signi ﬁ cantly smaller than the one that only used neuroimaging data or genetic data ( paired two sample t - test , p ¼ 0 . 002 and p ¼ 0 . 042 ) . The details of the ﬁ nal prediction models ( the coef ﬁ cients of the covariates in the linear regression model ) and the optimal p thresholds we used can be found in the Supplementary Material . In the functional neuroimaging regression analysis , the co - ef ﬁ cients for the neuroimaging data provided in the Supplementary Material show that the coef ﬁ cient for the average network strength made a contribution to the prediction that was signi ﬁ cant at p ¼ 6 . 19 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 13 , and that the coef ﬁ cients for age , gender , and the Raven ' s score made no signi ﬁ cant contribution to the prediction . Thus , the predictions were being made from the neuroimaging data , and not from the covariates of age , gender , and the Raven ' s score . In addition , for the prediction model using genomic data , the negative and positive mutation strength also made the main contribution to the prediction results with coef ﬁ cients signi ﬁ cant at p ¼ 4 . 80 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 14 and p ¼ 1 . 34 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 7 , respectively . To ensure that our leave - one - out framework can provide results that are signi ﬁ cantly better than random , a non - parametric permutation analysis was performed to test the signi ﬁ cance of the correlation between our predicted TTCT scores and real scores . One thousand times of random permutation were performed and resulted in a correlation signi ﬁ cant at p < 0 . 001 ( see Fig . S2 for more details ) . Creativity network and polygenic alliance shared among subjects The TTCT - related FCs that were shared among all subjects are listed in Table 1 , divided into positively - related ( 22 FCs ) and negatively - related groups ( 60 FCs ) . Most positively - related FCs ( 12 ) were associated with DMN , control networks and attention networks . 4 FCs connect ROIs in different task control networks and attention networks ; 3 FCs connected the frontal - parietal task control network with the visual network . Another 4 FCs contained ROIs in the DMN , with 2 FCs within the DMN and 2 FCs connecting the DMN with the visual and ventral attention network . Fig . 2 .

Liu et al . NeuroImage 174 ( 2018 ) 164 – 176 170 For the negatively - related FCs , 20 of them were associated with the DMN , with 3 FCs within the DMN . Of the other 17 FCs associated with the DMN , 5 FCs connected with the ventral attention network , 1 with the fronto - parietal task control network , 5 with the primary sensory net - works such as visual , sensory and auditory network , and another 5 with the subcortical network . In addition to default mode regions , the FCs between the control / attention networks and visual networks also correlated with creativity . There were 4 FCs connecting the cingulo - opercular task control network with the visual network and 5 FC con - necting the ventral attention network and visual network . The TTCT - related SNPs that were shared among all subjects ( poly - genic alliance ) are listed in Table 2 , with 5 positively related to TTCT and 8 negatively related . Speci ﬁ cally , SNP rs6606905 in the GABRG3 intron region was negatively correlated with the creativity score , and the cor - responding gene encodes a receptor for the major inhibitory neuro - transmitter GABA in the brain . SNP rs4340077 ( positively correlated with the score ) is in the intron region of SHANK2 , which is an adapter protein in the postsynaptic density ( PSD ) . SHANK2 has a function in coupling glutamate receptor scaffolds to the actin cytoskeleton and intracellular signaling pathways by means of their protein - protein interaction domains ( Naisbitt et al . , 1999 ) . Rs9877993 , another SNP that positively related to TTCT , is in the intron region of FGF12 a member of the ﬁ broblast growth factor family , which had also been found to be related to the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate ( Turner et al . , 2012 ) . Correlation within / between the creativity network and polygenic alliance The network strengths of the FCs that were positively and negatively related to TTCT ( denoted by FC _ pos _ TTCT and FC _ neg _ TTCT , respec - tively ) correlated more signi ﬁ cantly with the TTCT score ( r ¼ 0 . 698 , p ¼ 4 : 33 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 21 for positively related FCs and r ¼ (cid:2) 0 . 771 , p ¼ 4 : 33 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 28 for negatively related FCs ) than the FCs between any single pair of brain regions . The mutation strength of the SNPs that are positively and negatively related to ﬁ gural TTCT ( denoted by SNP _ pos _ TTCT and SNP _ neg _ TTCT , respectively ) were also more signi ﬁ cantly correlated with the TTCT score ( r ¼ 0 . 704 , p ¼ 5 : 60 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 22 for positively related SNPs , and r ¼ (cid:2) 0 . 651 , p ¼ 5 : 37 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 18 for negatively related SNPs ) than single SNP , see Table 1 and Fig . 3a . The network strengths of FC _ pos _ TTCT and FC _ neg _ TTCT also corre - lated more signi ﬁ cantly with the mutation strengths of SNP _ pos _ TTCT and SNP _ neg _ TTCT than each of the single FC , with r ¼ 0 . 541 , p ¼ 1 : 30 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 10 between FC _ pos _ TTCT and SNP _ pos _ TTCT , r ¼ (cid:2) 0 . 403 , p ¼ 1 : 48 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 6 between FC _ pos _ TTCT and SNP _ neg _ TTCT , r ¼ (cid:2) 0 . 539 , p ¼ 1 : 68 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 11 between FC _ neg _ TTCT and SNP _ pos _ TTCT , and r ¼ 0 . 632 , p ¼ 8 : 55 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 17 between FC _ neg _ TTCT and SNP _ neg _ TTCT , see Fig . 3a . Independent validation results Firstly , we used all the 138 samples in the ﬁ rst group to construct a linear prediction model using the shared creativity network . The neuro - imaging model from the ﬁ rst group used the overall network strength of the shared creativity network with age , sex and Raven ' s score to ﬁ t the TTCT score , which was the optimal prediction model that we obtained from our leave - one - out procedure . Then , the 98 samples from the second dataset that were not used to build the model were used to independently validate the neuroimaging prediction model . The correlation between the predicted score and the real TTCT score was 0 . 267 ( p ¼ 0 . 0078 , 95 % CI 0 . 072 to 0 . 442 ) , with the MAPE of the model being 35 . 4 % ( 64 . 6 % in terms of accuracy ) ( see Fig . S3 for more details ) . A non - parametric permutation analysis was then used to determine the signi ﬁ cance of our independent prediction results . To achieve this , we randomly permuted the real TTCT score of the 98 samples and calculated the Pearson correlation betweenthe shifted TTCT scores and the prediction scores for 10000 times to form the null distribution . The p - value of our prediction results is 0 . 0032 . In addi - tion , the correlation between the network strengths of the FC _ pos _ TTCT and FC _ neg _ TTCT that we identi ﬁ ed in the ﬁ rst dataset were still signi ﬁ - cantly correlated with the TTCT score in the second dataset with r ¼ 0 . 284 ( p ¼ 8 : 85 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 4 ) and r ¼ (cid:2) 0 . 311 ( p ¼ 2 : 59 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 4 ) .

The shared positively / negatively - related FCs ( with the TTCT score ) are shown by red and blue on the left . Different sub - networks are represented by different colors in the left legend . The mutation of the shared positively - related / negatively - related ( with the TTCT score ) polygenic alliance are shown on the right , each row representing a SNP and each column represents an individual . Different colors denote different numbers of the minor allele . The correlations within / between the network strength of the shared positive / negative network and mutation strength of the shared positive / negative creativity polygenic alliance are shown in ( a ) , as well as their correlation with the TTCT ﬁ gural score . ( b ) The creativity model we presented . The inner rectangle shows that both the increased top - down processing ( in red arrows ) and the decreasing bottom - up processing ( in blue ) relate to high creativity . The corresponding FCs relevant for top - down / bottom - up processing are also shown . The outer rectangle demonstrates the genetic factors contributing to high creativity . The mutation strength of the excitatory neurotransmitter related genes increases with creativity , and the mutation strength of the inhibitory neurotransmitter related genes de - creases with creativity . The competition between the two different kinds of neurotransmitters may in ﬂ uence the brain activity and further contribute to the high creativity . Z . Liu et al . NeuroImage 174 ( 2018 ) 164 – 176 172 Discussion In this work , we use a cross - validation based predictive framework to search for the imaging and genetic correlates of creativity to provide more generalization than traditional correlation analyses . We found that models using the network strength of the creativity network or the mu - tation strength of the creativity polygenic alliance could predict the in - dividual ' s performance with high accuracy , indicating that markers for creativity are present in both the FC between brain regions and in the genetic sequence . Further , the prediction model that combined neuro - imaging and genetic data achieved results signi ﬁ cantly better than pre - diction with single modality data , indicating that complementary information can be provided by different modalities , in this case func - tional neuroimaging and genetic modalities . Combining multi - modal data helped us to obtain a fuller picture of the biological mechanisms underlying creativity . We were able to validate our neuroimaging pre - diction model using a completely novel group containing 98 individuals . We used the FCs obtained from the resting - state in our analysis , which can re ﬂ ect patterns similar to those in cognitive task activation studies ( Biswal et al . , 1995 ; Smith et al . , 2009 ; Tavor et al . , 2016 ) . The FCs in the creativity - related brain networks associated with the DMN and are among various higher level networks , such as the DMN , attention network and control network . These networks have all been implicated in creative thought processes ( Dietrich and Kanso , 2010 ; Fink et al . , 2014a , 2014b ; Jung et al . , 2010 ; Takeuchi et al . , 2010 , 2011 ) . The DMN activity is associated with internally focused mental processes , such as mind wandering , perspective - taking , episodic future thinking and autobio - graphical retrieval ( Andrews - Hanna et al . , 2014 ) . A growing number of studies reported that the DMN was recruited to generate novel ideas in both domain - general and domain - speci ﬁ c creativity tasks ( Liu et al . , 2015b ; Saggar et al . , 2015 ) . For example , individual differences in brain FC or structural characterizations within the DMN were able to predict individual creativity ( Chen et al . , 2015 ; Takeuchi et al . , 2012 ; Wei et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , the DMN activity contributes to the spontaneous generation of candidate ideas , which was considered as an initial and vital phase during creative thinking process . The control network and attention networks , on the other hand , have been shown to be responsible for the evaluation of candidate ideas during creative cognitive processes ( Die - trich , 2004 ; Dietrich and Kanso , 2010 ) . As a further step , our ﬁ ndings highlight the importance of the interactions among high level cognitive control networks for creative thought processes . We found that the FCs between the DMN , control network and dorsal attention network / ventral attention network / memory retrieval network correlate positively with the TTCT score . Our results suggest that creative thinking involves the free generation of possible solutions as well as selection among the produced alternatives ( Campbell , 1960 ) , that arise from the DMN and executive control networks , respectively ( Dietrich A and R Kanso , 2010 ; Beaty RE et al . , 2016 ) . More importantly , these results provide support for the hypothesis that creative thought bene ﬁ ts from dynamic cooper - ation of the default mode and control networks to produce thoughts that are both novel and appropriate . Thus , creative ideas depend on self - generated thought but also need control by a top - down goal - directed process ( Beaty et al . , 2016 ) . Our ﬁ ndings that the FCs between the DMN with the primary sensory networks ( visual , auditory and sensory - motor ) and ventral attention networks are negatively correlated with the individuals ' creativity score , indicate that high creativity individuals have the ability to inhibit con - spicuous task - relevant stimulation and shift toward task - irrelevant stimuli during creative thinking ( Berkowitz and Ansari , 2010 ) . This is in agreement with the ﬁ nding that an individual ' s creativity level is positively related to increased alpha power in the frontal cortex during creative ideation , which re ﬂ ects more internally orientated attention that is characterized by the absence of bottom - up stimulation ( Fink and Benedek , 2014 ) . In addition to describing the creativity - related neural networks in terms of the few networks used by Power et al . , 2011 ) , it is also useful to consider in more detail the brain areas related to the creativity score using a more detailed anatomical atlas such as a Brodmann parcellation ( Jacobs , 2011 ) . The MNI coordinates and Brodmann areas of the ROIs are shown in Table S1 for the functional connectivities with positive corre - lations with ﬁ gural creativity , and in Table S2 for the functional con - nectivities with negative correlations with ﬁ gural creativity . First , we focus on the functional connectivities with positive corre - lations with ﬁ gural creativity shown in Table S1 ( see also Table 1 ) . It is evident from Table S1 that many ( 11 ) of the 44 areas involved in FC related to ﬁ gural creativity involved left area BA 40 ( part of Wernicke ' s area ) , or right BA 45 , 46 and 47 ( contralateral to Broca ' s area ) . Also related to this positive correlation with ﬁ gural connectivity are the left inferior prefrontal convexity / lateral orbitofrontal cortex areas , which may relate to processing in the nearby Broca ' s area . Increased FCs of some posterior cingulate areas ( with e . g . temporal cortex areas ) may re ﬂ ect the involvement of these posterior cingulate areas in spatial processing ( Kravitz et al . , 2011 ) which is likely to be important for ﬁ gural creativity . The ﬁ ndings described here are consistent with and thus supported by a meta - analysis of activations in 24 neuroimaging studies related to crea - tivity ( Boccia et al . , 2015 ) , but the FC analyses described here take the analysis an important step further , by providing evidence on which of the functional connectivities between these areas is related to ﬁ gural creativity . Second , we consider the functional connectivities with negative cor - relations with ﬁ gural creativity shown in Table S2 ( see also Table 1 ) . One brain area with prominent negative correlations was the fusiform gyrus , with its functional connectivities with an inferior frontal gyrus / lateral orbitofrontal cortex region ( Power et al . ROIs 175 , 208 , 211 , and 198 ) , with the anterior cingulate cortex ( Power et al . ROIs 216 ) , and with the putamen especially marked ( Table S2 ) . The fusiform gyrus has perceptual representations , and the inferior frontal gyrus on the left includes part of Broca ' s area and also non - reward / error systems ( Rolls , 2016a , 2016b ) . Another brain area with prominent negative correlations with ﬁ gural creativity was the auditory cortex / supramarginal gyrus ( Power et al . ROIs 138 ) in especially its functional connectivities with secondary vi - sual cortical areas ( Power et al . ROIs 164 , 150 , 173 , 151 , V3 , V4 and V5 ) . The reduced FCs between high order visual and auditory association cortical areas that is associated with high ﬁ gural creativity might suggest that high ﬁ gural creativity is associated with less visual / auditory bottom - up processing . Finally , the right hemisphere has been shown to play a dominant role in creative thinking ( Bhattacharya and Petsche , 2005 ; Bowden and Jung - Beeman , 2003 ; Falcone and Loder , 1984 ; Friedman and Forster , 2005 ) . It is interesting to note that although both within - hemisphere and between - hemisphere FCs correlate signi ﬁ cantly with the ﬁ gural crea - tivity score , the 4 FCs that connect ROIs in the task control network and attention network , and the FC between the cingular - opercular control network and the memory retrieval network , are all right - lateralized . This suggests that increased top - down control in the right hemisphere facili - tates a global thinking / context - dependent thinking style and ﬁ gural processes crucial for ﬁ gural creativity ( Mihov et al . , 2010 ) . The creativity of the brain may be related , at least partly , to genetic and environmental interactions ( Blunt , 2010 ) . Although the genetic causes of creativity may be diverse , many heterogeneous genes have been implicated in creativity such as those affecting DA , 5HT or GABA meta - bolism ( Blunt , 2010 ; Reuter et al . , 2006 ) , mostly belonging to neuro - transmitter systems . It has been shown that reduced task - induced deactivation in the precuneus correlates with higher creativity in diver - gent thinking ( Takeuchi et al . , 2011 ) . Considering also that individuals with a higher GABA / glutamate ratio tend to suppress ongoing neural activities of the precuneus more ef ﬁ ciently ( Hu et al . , 2013 ) , these results indicate that the GABA / glutamate ratio may be closely related to the creativity of a brain . Our genetic results are concordant with these ﬁ ndings by showing that mutations of genes related to both excitatory and inhibitory neu - rotransmitters are associated with creative thinking . We ﬁ nd that Z . Liu et al . NeuroImage 174 ( 2018 ) 164 – 176 173 mutation of a SNP in GABRG3 , the receptor for GABA , is negatively related to the ﬁ gural TTCT score , while several SNPs in genes related to glutamate ( SHANK2 , FGF12 ) correlate positively with the ﬁ gural TTCT score . The mutation of these SNPs relevant for neurotransmitter systems may disturb the balance between the two different kinds of neurotrans - mitter , i . e . glutamate and GABA . Since these mutations are found to be signi ﬁ cantly associated with both the creativity - related network and the ﬁ gural TTCT score , we therefore postulate that this difference in the glutamate and GABA transmitter may have an impact on the FCs asso - ciated with regions ( including the precuneus ) of the DMN , control , and attention networks . Moreover , it is interesting to note that among all the 13 SNPs we found to be related to the ﬁ gural TTCT score , 5 are associated with genes ( ITGA4 , SHANK2 , MIR548 , GABRG3 and FGF12 ) that have been reported to be relevant to autism ( Ander et al . , 2015 ; Buxbaum et al . , 2002 ; Correia et al . , 2009 ; Leblond et al . , 2012 ; Vaccarino et al . , 2009 ; Won et al . , 2012 ) . Autistic traits have been demonstrated to be associated with high numbers of unusual responses on the divergent thinking tasks ( Best et al . , 2015 ) . The creativity - related functional brain networks and the genetic al - liances that we used to predict the creativity score in the ﬁ rst dataset contained many different FCs and SNPs . Although we con ﬁ rmed that the sum of all the FCs ( strength of the networks ) were signi ﬁ cantly correlated with creativity score in all the two dataset and the FCs or SNPs as a whole ( i . e . , their sum ) could predict the creativity score well , it should be noted that not every FC / SNP in the brain networks / genetic alliances was associated with creativity score signi ﬁ cantly ( i . e . , survived from correc - tion for multiple comparisons ) . In our feature selection and prediction procedures , we took into ac - count factors that might have affected our prediction models . For example , for head motion , which could be a potential confounding factor for neuroimaging data ( Liu et al . , 2015a ; Yan et al . , 2013 ; Zuo et al . , 2013 ) , we performed two further motion control procedures in the 138 sample group to con ﬁ rm that it did not confound our prediction models . Firstly , the correlation between the mean framewise displacement ( FD ) with the creativity score and our predicted score were calculated . We found that the mean FD did not correlate with the real TTCT score or the predicted score ( r ¼ 0 . 116 , p ¼ 0 . 157 and r ¼ 0 . 114 and p ¼ 0 . 183 ) . Secondly , we used the brain network with the mean FD regressed out to build a new prediction model using the network strength of the creativity - related functional brain network . The correlation between the predicted score ( r ¼ 0 . 420 ) and the prediction accuracy ( 72 . 7 % ) did not differ signi ﬁ cantly from the results provided in the Results section . The relationship between the individuals ' TTCT ﬁ gural creativity and their age and Raven ' s score were also analyzed . The procedure was to use age , sex and the Raven ' s score as covariates in the regression equation ( C k in eq . ( 1 ) above ) that estimated the creativity score from the FCs . This ensured that the prediction was from the FCs with the effects of age , sex and the Raven ' s score regressed out . We found that the ﬁ gural crea - tivity score was signi ﬁ cantly though weakly ( p ¼ 0 . 037 ) negatively related to age ( from ~ 18 to ~ 22 ) ( see Fig . S4 ) . However , the Raven ' s score and sex were not signi ﬁ cantly related to the ﬁ gural creativity score , indicating that the ﬁ gural creativity prediction is not confounded by individuals ' gender or general intelligence ( see Fig . S5 ) . In the regression analysis , the coef ﬁ cients for the neuroimaging data ( part A ) show that the coef ﬁ cient for the average network strength made a contribution to the prediction that was signi ﬁ cant at p ¼ 6 . 19 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 13 , and that the co - ef ﬁ cients for age , gender , and the Raven ' s score made no signi ﬁ cant contribution to the prediction . In the Supplementary Material , in the prediction model from the genetic data ( part B ) , there is a negative co - ef ﬁ cient for the contribution of age that is signi ﬁ cant ( p ¼ 1 . 92 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 5 ) , and this is of interest . In conclusion , we have for the ﬁ rst time investigated both the neural and genetic correlates of ﬁ gural creativity using whole - brain FCs and the whole - genome . We ﬁ nd that we can predict ﬁ gural connectivity signi ﬁ - cantly better from the FCs and the genome ( 78 . 4 % ) than from the FCs alone ( 76 . 1 % ) or the genetic data alone ( 77 . 5 % ) . The FCs positively related to creativity were associated with the “ control networks ” and “ attention networks ” ( as identi ﬁ ed by Power et al . , 2011 ) typical of top - down processes , while the FCs negatively related to creativity were between the DMN and the primary sensory networks that are associated with bottom - up processes . The implication is that ﬁ gural creativity is associated with strong top - down control versus weak bottom - up process in the resting state . The genes associated with ﬁ gural connectivity are involved in glutamate and GABA functionality , and an implication is that the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synaptic function may be important in ﬁ gural creativity . The results described here provides the ﬁ rst insight into how a combination of neural and gene - related factors are related to creative thinking . The brain areas related to ﬁ gural creativity included increased visual association cortex connectivity with inferior frontal gyrus areas related to Broca ' s area , and with Wernicke ' s area , which may relate to enhanced visual imagery in those with high ﬁ gural creativity .
