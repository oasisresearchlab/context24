We found that knockdown of nucleoside diphosphate kinases ( NDPKs ) NM23 - H1 / H2 , which produce GTP through adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) – driven conversion of guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) , inhibited dynamin - mediated endocytosis . NM23 - H1 / H2 localized at clathrin - coated pits and interacted with the proline - rich domain of dynamin . In vitro , NM23 - H1 / H2 were recruited to dynamin - induced tubules , stimulated GTP - loading on dynamin , and triggered fission in the presence of ATP and GDP . NM23 - H4 , a mitochondria - specific NDPK , colocalized with mitochondrial dynamin - like OPA1 involved in mitochondria inner membrane fusion and increased GTP - loading on OPA1 . Like OPA1 loss of function , silencing of NM23 - H4 but not NM23 - H1 / H2 resulted in mitochondrial fragmentation , reflecting fusion defects . Thus , NDPKs interact with and provide GTP to dynamins , allowing these motor proteins to work with high thermodynamic efficiency . T he 100 - kD dynamin guanosine triphospha - tase ( GTPase ) promotesuptakeofcell - surface receptors both by clathrin - dependent and - independentpathways ( 1 , 2 ) . Dynaminpolym - erizes into helix around the neck of endocytic pits and induces guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) hydrolysis – driven membrane fission ( 3 – 7 ) . Typ - ical of molecular motors , dynamin has a low affinity for GTP and a high basal GTP - hydrolysis rate , which can be further stimulated by dynamin polymerization ( 8 , 9 ) . This maximizes chemical energy gain and kineticsof hydrolysis , respectively , which in vivo depend on high concentration ratios of adenosine triphosphate / adenosine diphosphate ( ATP / ADP ) or GTP / guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) . The cellular concentrations of GTP and GDP are at least a factor of 10 lower than those of ATP and ADP , and GTP / GDP ratios could thus decrease much more rapidly at elevated workload , both of which make GTP not an ideal substrate for high - turnover , energy - dependentenzymes . Paradoxically , dynamin GTPases are among the most powerful molecular motors described ( 7 ) . Studies in Drosophila identified a genetic in - teraction between dynamin and Awd ( 10 – 12 ) . Awd belongs to the family of nucleoside di - phosphate kinases ( NDPKs ) , which catalyze syn - thesis of nucleoside triphosphates , including GTP , from corresponding nucleoside diphos - phates and ATP ( 13 ) . The most abundant human NDPKs are the highly related cytosolic proteins NM23 - H1 and - H2 . NM23 - H4 , another NDPK - family member , localizes exclusively at the mito - chondrial inner membrane ( 14 , 15 ) .

Asterisk indi - cates nonspecific background band . RESEARCH | REPORTS membrane dynamics require dynamin - related GTPases ( 16 ) . We hypothesized that NDPKs could influence the function of dynamin fam - ily members in membrane - remodeling events through spatially controlled GTP production and availability . Knockdown of NM23 - H1 and - H2 ( fig . S1 , A to E ) reduced clathrin - dependent endocytosis of the transferrin ( Tf ) and epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptors ( Fig . 1 , A and B , and fig . S2 , A to E ) and clathrin - independent dynamin - dependent endocytosis of interleukin - 2 recep - tor b subunit ( Fig . 1C ) . The endocytic defect of EGF receptor waspartiallyrescued byexpression of wild - type , small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) – resistant NM23 - H1 , butnotbykinase - deadNM23 - H1 H118N mutant ( Fig . 1D ) . Thus , the function of Awd / NM23 in dynamin - mediated endocytosis is conserved from Drosophila to mammalian cells [ ( 10 ) and this study ] . Like in dynamin - null cells ( 17 ) , NM23 - H1 / H2 depletion increased the density of clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2 , A and B , and fig . S3 , A and B ) . Silencing of NM23 - H1 / H2 led to the accumulation of deeply invag - inated CCPs , in contrast to control cells , where CCPs were rarely detected at the plasma mem - brane ( Fig . 2 , C to F ) . Scoring for Tf - positive CCPs and vesicles in the vicinity of the plasma mem - brane revealed an approximately threefold augmen - tation in the absence of NM23 ( Fig . 2G ) , similar to the phenotype reported in dynamin - null cells ( 17 ) , suggesting a role for NM23 - H1 / H2 in dynamin - mediated membrane fission at CCPs . We examined the intracellular distribution of NM23 - H1 / H2 and confirmed that both iso - forms were predominantly cytosolic , although a low but reproducible association of both iso - forms with membranes was found ( fig . S4 , A and B ) .

RESEARCH | REPORTS ( TIRF ) microscopy analysis of cells labeled with antibody to NM23 - H2 revealed the co - localization of NM23 - H2 with AP - 2 ( a - adaptin ) and dynamin - 2 at CCPs ( fig . S5 , A to D ) , which was confirmed by means of proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) , which showed a close proximity of NM23 - H1 / H2 with a - adaptin and dynamin - 2 at CCPs ( Fig . 2 , H and I , and figs . S6 and S7 ) . Fur - thermore , NM23 - H1 / H2 coimmunoprecipitated with dynamin - 1 ( Fig . 3A ) and with dynamin - 2 ( Fig . 3B ) , and purified full - length recombinant NM23 - H2 and dynamin - 2 interacted directly in vitro ( Fig . 3C ) . We investigated the contribu - tion of the C - terminal proline - rich domain ( PRD ) of dynamin - 2 to this interaction because this domain binds to several dynamin regulators and effectors ( 18 ) . The dynamin - 2 PRD domain fused to glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) pulled - down NM23 - H1 and - H2 , indicating that dynamin - 2 phys - ically interacts with both NM23 - H1 / H2 isoforms through its PRD ( Fig . 3D ) . Thus , NM23 - H1 / H2 in - teract with endocytic dynamins at CCPs . Next , we explored the role of NM23 NDPK activity in dynamin function . Whereas silenc - ing of both NM23 - H1 and - H2 isoforms caused a ~ 80 % decrease of NDPK activity ( fig . S8A ) , overall intracellular GTP levels were not af - fected by NM23 knockdown ( fig . S8B ) [ nor were other nucleoside triphosphate levels affected ( fig . S8C ) ] . Thus , decreased endocytic rate and increased CCP accumulation of NM23 - depleted cells were not a consequence of a reduced bulk intracellular GTP concentration , but rather sup - port a role of NM23 - dynamin complexes in which NM23 generates GTP in the vicinity of dynamins to avoid a local drop in GTP / GDP ratio . Indeed , in the absence of added GTP and in the presence of NM23 substrates GDP ( 1 mM ) and ATP ( 1 mM ) , catalytically active recombinant NM23 - H1 and - H2 proteins triggered GTPase activity of dynamin - 1 and - 2 ( Fig . 3E ) , whereas kinase - dead NM23 - H1 H118N mutant did not ( Fig . 3E ) . In the presence of nucleotide concentra - tions close to cellular levels — 100 m M GTP , 10 m M GDP , and 1 mM ATP — NM23 - H1 and - H2 were still able to enhance dynamin - 1 ’ s GTPase activ - ity by 30 to 35 % , indicating that NM23 could stimulate dynamin activity further in the pres - ence of physiological GTP level ( Fig . 3F ) . This reflects the capacity of H1 / H2 to directly pro - vide GTP to dynamins within NM23 / dynamin complexes . Next , we monitored the capacity of NM23 to promote dynamin - mediated membrane fission in vitro . Classical dynamins can tubulate mem - brane sheets in the absence of GTP and then fragment the tubules depending on GTP hydrol - ysis ( 6 ) . Dynamin - induced tubular networks re - mained stable in the presence of 1 mM ATP and 1 mM GDP and in the absence of NM23 ( Fig . 3G and movie S1 ) , and tubules were not altered by NM23 - H1 or - H2 in the absence of nucleotides ( Fig . 3G and movies S2 and S3 , time 0 ) . In contrast , in the presence of NM23 , addition of 1 mM ATP and 1 mM GDP induced breakage and collapse of the tubule network ( Fig . 3G and movies S2 and S3 ) , with a fission density of 1 event per 8 . 3 - m m tube length ( n = 20 tubes ) . Most of the fission events occurred during the first 60 s after addition of ATP and GDP ( fig . S9A ) . Immunogold electron microscopy ( EM ) on liposomes incubated in the presence of pu - rified NM23 - H2 and dynamin - 1 revealed that NM23 - H2 decorated the length of the mem - brane tubules ( Fig . 3 , H and I ) . In addition , EM of negatively stained preparations of membrane tubules confirmed the association of NM23 - H2 to the surface of dynamin - 1 – coated tubules 1512 27 JUNE 2014 (cid:127) VOL 344 ISSUE 6191 sciencemag . org SCIENCE Fig . 2 .

Given theefficiencyof NM23 - driven GTP supply to dynamins , we explored whether in another compartment , the mitochondria , mitochondrial NM23 - H4 isoform was capable of supporting dynamin - related GTPase OPA1 . In contrast to the typical tubular morphology of mitochondria in HeLa cells transfected with MitoDsRed , cells silenced for NM23 - H4 showed abnormally frag - mented and swollen mitochondria ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . Depletion of NM23 - H4 phenocopied the loss of OPA1 on mitochondrial morphology , whereas knockdown of NM23 - H1 / H2 did not alter mito - chondrial morphology ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . EM con - firmed the severity of mitochondria alterations in NM23 - H4 – depleted cells ( Fig . 4C ) , which is reminiscent of mitochondrial fusion defects as a result of OPA1 loss of function ( 19 ) . Furthermore , immunofluorescence staining and PLA docu - mented the colocalization and close proximity of NM23 - H4 and OPA1 in mitochondria ( Fig . 4D and fig . S10 ) , which is in agreement with their reported interaction ( 20 ) . To directly show the involvementof NM23 - H4 in GTP fueling to OPA1 , we determined the GTP hydrolysis rate of OPA1 reflecting GTP loading . Recombinant NM23 - H4 triggered OPA1 ’ s GTPase activity in the presence of liposomes , mimicking the composition of the mitochondrial inner membrane ( Fig . 4E ) . GTP loading on OPA1 was further increased by ~ 30 % by NM23 - H4 in the presence of native mitochon - drial GTP concentration ( Fig . 4F ) , which is sim - ilar to that observed for NM23 - H1 / H2 on classical dynamins ( Fig . 3F ) . 1514 27 JUNE 2014 (cid:127) VOL 344 ISSUE 6191 sciencemag . org SCIENCE RESEARCH | REPORTS Fig . 4 .

We have shown that members of the NM23 / NDPK family interact directly and specifically with members of the dynamin superfamily and thus are positioned to maintain high local GTP concentrations and promote dynamin - dependent membrane remodeling . The role of NM23 is well supported by their high NDPK turnover number [ k cat 600 s − 1 per active site ( 21 ) ] . Furthermore , the localization of the NM23 - H3 isoform at the mitochondrial outer membrane ( fig . S11 ) , where dynamin Drp1 is recruited to mediate mitochon - drial fission , suggests that NM23 - H3 could assist Drp1 in this process . These findings identify a general mechanism by which different NDPKs maintain high GTP concentration to high - turnover GTPase dynamins for efficient work in different membrane compartments .

Nathan Kutz 2 Pollinators use their sense of smell to locate flowers from long distances , but little is known about how they are able to discriminate their target odor from a mélange of other natural and anthropogenic odors . Here , we measured the plume from Datura wrightii flowers , a nectar resource for Manduca sexta moths , and show that the scent was dynamic and rapidly embedded among background odors . The moth ’ s ability to track the odor was dependent on the background and odor frequency . By influencing the balance of excitation and inhibition in the antennal lobe , background odors altered the neuronal representation of the target odor and the ability of the moth to track the plume . These results show that the mix of odors present in the environment influences the pollinator ’ s olfactory ability . T he olfactory environment is complex and rich , filledwithnatural , biogenicallyemitted volatile compounds ( volatiles ) and closely related volatiles from anthropogenic sources , such as those from combustion engines ( 1 – 4 ) . Insects must successfully discriminate and locatebiologicallyimportantscents , suchasthose emitted byfood , mates , or hosts , fromwithin this complex mixture ( 5 – 8 ) . How does the insect ol - factory system accomplish this task ? Our under - standing of these effects has been hampered by an inability to measure natural scents at time scalesexperienced by insectsin nature and to link this information with an understanding of how the brain discriminatesolfactory stimuli fromthe background odor landscape . InthesouthwestUSA , the Manducasexta ( here - after , Manduca ) moth navigates to , and polli - nates , Datura wrightii flowers that are separated by hundreds of meters ( 9 – 11 ) . D . wrightii ( here - after , Datura ) often grow in dense stands of cre - osote bush ( Larrea tridentata ) , which emit a high - intensityodor ( > 100mg / h ) thatincludessome ofthesamearomaticvolatiles ( e . g . , benzaldehyde ) as the scent of Datura ( 9 , 12 ) . A proton transfer – reaction massspectrometer , whichenablessimultaneousmeasurementofmul - tiple volatiles at subsecond time scales , allowed us to measure the scent plume from Datura flowers and characterize its dynamics ( Fig . 1A ) . Measurementofionsfromoxygenatedaromatics ( ARs , e . g . , benzaldehyde ) andmonoterpenes ( MOs , linalool and geraniol ) showed that the floral plume increased in frequency and decreased in intermittency with increasing distance from the flower ( Fig . 1 , A to C ) . The ratio of volatiles in the plume also changed as the background volatiles from neighboring vegetation , including creosote bush plants , became intermixed with the plume ( Fig . 1 , D and E ) . To determine how the changing frequency of the target odor influenced the moth ’ s abil - ity to locate the flower , we used a wind tunnel and a computer - controlled odor - stimulus system to test the moths ’ response to the Datura mix - ture at different frequencies ( 1 to 20 Hz ) and embedded in different backgrounds [ figs . S1 and S2 ; table S1 ; see supplementary materials ( SM ) for details ] . Compared with the responses to a mineral oil ( no - odor ) control , moths ex - hibited the strongest response to odor pulses of 1 Hz ( Fig . 2A 1 ) ( 2 × 2 c 2 test , P < 0 . 001 ) . How - ever , frequencies higher than 1 to 2 Hz resulted in behavior similar to that displayed in response to the no - odor controls ( Fig . 2 , A 2 and B ) ( 2 × 2 c 2 test , P > 0 . 33 ) . We next tested the moths ’ ability to track the flower - odor plume at a frequency of 1 Hz among a background of different odors , ranging from volatiles that do not occur in the Datura mixture [ nonoverlapping , ethyl sorbate ] to those that do : for instance , ( i ) volatiles that occur in the flower odor and thereby change the constituent ratio ( e . g . , benzaldehyde ) and ( ii ) the complex odor backgroundofcreosotebush ( L . tridentata ) that also shares volatiles with Datura . The volatile backgroundsignificantlymodifiedthemoth ’ sodor - tracking ability ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . For example , when exposed to the Datura plume with a back - ground of ethyl sorbate [ a volatile that is not in the Datura floral odor and chemically dissimilar toconstituentsofthe Datura mixture ( 10 ) ] , moths navigated to and located the odor source ( Fig . 2 , C 1 and D ) ( 2 × 2 c 2 test , P < 0 . 001 ) . By contrast , when challenged with the Datura plume in a background of benzaldehyde ( a volatile in cre - osote bush and Datura scents ) , the moth ’ s ability to correctly navigate to the odor significantly decreased ( Fig . 2C 2 ) ( 2 × 2 c 2 test relative to Datura mixture , P < 0 . 01 ; c 2 test relative to no odor control , P = 0 . 44 ) .
