Restraint on Coarse - grained Variables A conformational change occurs in actin monomers upon polymerization . One of the main changes is a flattening of the subdomain 2 - 1 - 3 - 4 dihedral angle . We chose to mimic the F - actin environment by simulating an actin monomer in an initial F - actin geometry and restraining the coarse - grain ( CG ) variable of the 2 - 1 - 3 - 4 dihedral angle . This was done in CP2K by creating a collective variable containing the center - of - mass of the C α positions of the four subdomains and restraining that variable to be at a value of - 0 . 55° with a harmonic force constant of 228 . 8 kcal / mol . Additional QM / MM Metadynamics Simulation Details Two collective variables were biased in the QM / MM simulations of ATP hydrolysis in actin . The coordination number between P ! and O ! describes the making and breaking of the P ! − O ! bond and allows for recombination with any of the O ! atoms . This is depicted as CV1 in Figure S1 . The mathematical form of the coordination number is : 𝐶𝑁 = 1 − 𝑟 ! − 𝑟 ! ! 𝜎 ! ! 1 − 𝑟 ! − 𝑟 ! ! 𝜎 ! " ! ∈ ! ! ! " # $ % where 𝜎 = 4 . 5 𝐵𝑜 ℎ 𝑟 was chosen to describe the making and breaking of the P - O bonds and NN = 6 and ND = 12 are CP2K default values . The second collective variable biased in the metadynamics simulation is the coordination number between P ! and both O ! and QM water oxygens . This variable is chosen to describe the associative pathway of hydrolysis in which the lytic water adds to the gamma phosphate . This variable is depicted as CV2 in Figure S1 and the mathematical form is the same as above . Figure S1 .

S2 Comparison of Starting Structures of G - and F - actin The starting structures for G - and F - actin were taken from equilibrated classical molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations . G - actin simulations were started from the crystal structure ( pdb code 1NWK ) . The F - actin system was started from the Oda model ( pdb code 2ZWH ) in a 13mer periodic filament . Both systems were neutralized , solvated and equilibrated and simulated for at least 50 ns . In order to insure that the starting structures were indeed different , the residue by residue RMSD relative to each other was computed ( Figure S2a ) . Numerous areas ( residues 50 - 75 and 225 - 250 ) have RMSD values of 8 Å or more suggesting that the two structures are indeed quite different . The RMSD values for the 10 amino acids identified in the QM region are highlighted with red dots in Figure S 2a . These areas do not have extremely large RMSD values but values of 1 - 2 Å still suggest slight differences in the QM region that may lead to differences in ATP hydrolysis . In order to ensure that the F - actin structure is not only different than the equilibrated G - actin structure but also to the G - actin crystal structure , the residue by residue RMSD as compared to the crystal structure was computed ( Figure S2b ) . The trends seen here are similar to the above with regions such as residues 50 - 75 and 225 - 250 showing large RMSD values . Figure S2 .

Discussion of Sources of Error . A barrier height reductio n of 8 kcal / mol is computed for ATP hydrolysis in F - actin as compared to G - actin from metadynamics QM / MM simulations . In comparison , the experimentally measured value is 7 kcal / mol . The 1 kcal / mol discrepancy is reasonable given the assumptions and appro ximations in our model . One obvious source of error is the density functional chosen . The barrier height discrepancy with experiment is also similar to the mean unsigned error of 1 . 8 kcal / mol ( in solvent ) for the barrier height for phosphodiester hydrolysis computed using DFT with the PBE functional . 1 Previous hydrolysis simulations using both PBE and BLYP funct ionals reported similar barrier height magnitudes to those reported in this study . 2 - 6 S3 Correlation Between Biased Collective Variables and Proton Transfer The correlation between the two collective variables biased in the metadynamics simulations and the proton transfer pathway was monitored . The proton transfer variable chosen was that of the protonation state of the lytic water . It was found that a change in both collective variables ( CV1 and CV2 described above ) lead to proton transfer ( Figure S3 ) suggesting a strong coupling between these degrees of freedom . Additionally , the time - scale of the proton transfer process is much more rapid than the change in two collective variables we chose to include in our metad ynamics bias . Figure S3 . The correlation of metadynamics biased collective variables ( CV1 in ( a ) and CV2 in ( b ) ) and protonation of lytic water for F-­‐actin . The metadynamics time of the given ordered pair is color-­‐coded from red ( prior to hydrolysis ) to blue ( post hydrolysis ) . The change in collective variable , in both cases , leads to a rapid deprotonation of the lytic water . Supplemental References ( 1 ) Ribeiro , A . n . J . M . ; Ramos , M . J . ; Fernandes , P . A .
