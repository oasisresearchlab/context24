While ADF / co - ﬁlin and Aip1 have been identiﬁed as central players , how their activities are modulated by the architecture of the networks remains unknown . Using our ability to reconstitute a diverse array of cellular actin organi - zations , we found that ADF / coﬁlin binding and ADF / coﬁlin - mediated disassembly both depend on actin geometrical organization . ADF / coﬁlin decorates strongly and stabilizes actin cables , whereas its weaker interaction to Arp2 / 3 complex networks is correlated with their dismantling and their reorgani - zation into stable architectures . Cooperation of ADF / coﬁlin with Aip1 is necessary to trigger the full disassembly of all actin ﬁlament networks . Additional experiments performed at the single - molecule level indicate that this cooperation is optimal above a threshold of 23 molecules of ADF / coﬁlin bound as clusters along an actin ﬁlament . Our results indicate that although ADF / coﬁlin is able to dismantle selec - tively branched networks through severing and de - branching , stochastic disassembly of actin ﬁlaments by ADF / coﬁlin and Aip1 represents an efﬁcient alter - native pathway for the full disassembly of all actin networks . Our data support a model in which the binding of ADF / coﬁlin is required to trigger a struc - tural change of the actin ﬁlaments , as a prerequisite for their disassembly by Aip1 . INTRODUCTION Cells change shape at a microscopic or mesoscopic scale by exerting internal forces based on dynamical actin networks [ 1 ] . The turnover of actin is characterized by a rapid , organized , and localized polymerization of actin ﬁlaments , followed by their controlled disassembly . However , in an apparent contra - diction , actin is a very stable polymer , with a limited capacity to disassemble by itself [ 1 ] . The assembly of different types of actin networks in vitro indicates that actin structures can remain stable for long periods of time [ 2 , 3 ] . Therefore , an essential requirement for cells to perform a rapid actin turnover is to be able to trigger a fast disassembly of aging actin net - works , which can only be performed with the contribution of accessory proteins [ 1 , 4 ] . A central player in actin disassembly is ADF / coﬁlin , a 13 - to 21 - kDa protein conserved in all eukaryotes [ 5 ] . ADF / coﬁlin binds to the side of actin ﬁlaments and induces important structural changes , which renders them more compliant to bending and twisting [ 6 , 7 ] . A large body of literature describes how important these structural changes are for the activity of ADF / coﬁlin . Cur - rent models propose that actin ﬁlaments fully decorated by ADF / coﬁlin are stable ; however , actin ﬁlaments decorated by sub - stoichiometric densities of ADF / coﬁlin are severed because they accumulate some mechanical stress at the boundaries be - tween bare and ADF / coﬁlin - decorated segments [ 6 – 8 ] . Severing , by itself , is not sufﬁcient to explain how every actin network can be disassembled in cells ( reviewed in [ 4 ] ) . Therefore , other molecular players , including Aip1 , have been suggested to cooperate with ADF / coﬁlin to disassemble actin networks efﬁ - ciently [ 9 – 19 ] . Aip1 has binding sites for both actin and ADF / co - ﬁlin and was recently identiﬁed as a crucial factor to destabilize freely ﬂuctuating coﬁlin - saturated actin ﬁlaments [ 17 , 18 ] . How - ever , ( 1 ) how these proteins interact with organized actin net - works and how they contribute , individually or together , to their disassembly , have yet to be determined , and ( 2 ) how the activ - ities of ADF / coﬁlin and Aip1 are coordinated at the molecular level to disassemble actin ﬁlaments remains unclear . Here we studied the impact of these families of disassembly factors on actin networks of various architectures . We per - formed this characterization by using protein micropatterning technologies , which permit the geometrical - control of deﬁned actin organization , combined with total internal reﬂection ﬂuo - rescence microscopy and triple - color imaging . We found that the efﬁciency of actin disassembly factors is dependent on the organization of the ﬁlaments . Hence , rather than identifying a unique and general mechanism for the disassembly of actin net - works in cells , our work suggests that cells may have alternative pathways for the disassembly of actin networks . In addition , our work at the molecular level indicates a possible unidentiﬁed function for ADF / coﬁlin , as marker to maintain actin ﬁlaments or networks in a pre - disassembly state . RESULTS ADF / Coﬁlin - Induced Actin Disassembly Depends on Actin Architecture We ﬁrst aimed to characterize the effects of critical components of actin disassembly on different actin architectures . Recently , protein micropatterning has been developed to reconstitute Current Biology 25 , 1 – 11 , June 1 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 1 Please cite this article in press as : Gressin et al . , Architecture Dependence of Actin Filament Network Disassembly , Current Biology ( 2015 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . cub . 2015 . 04 . 011 in vitro , within the same ﬁeld of observation , the three main cellular actin organizations ( i . e . , Arp2 / 3 branched networks , par - allel cables , or cables of mixed polarity ) [ 20 ] . In this study , we micropatterned motifs of Las17 at the surface of coverslips ( Fig - ure 1A ) . Las17 is the homolog of WASP in yeast , a nucleation - promoting factor ( NPF ) of the Arp2 / 3 complex able to trigger the formation of actin networks in the presence of a polymerizing mixture containing the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin [ 21 , 22 ] . We chose a type of geometry with two parallel bars ( of 20 - m m length ) of Las17 separated by 30 m m . With this motif , branched networks are assembled on the patterns and parallel cables emerged from the free elongation of the ﬁlaments away from the patterned areas ( Figures 1B and 1C and Movie S1 ) . Cables of mixed polar - ity are formed between the bars , whereas parallel cables are assembled in other areas . We also pasted on top of the coverslips a 6 - mm - thick layer of polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) pinched with a 6 - mm - diameter hole ( Figure 1A ) . PDMS created wells and gave the possibility to bring sequentially additional fac - tors in solution . Actin networks were imaged at the surface of the coverslips with total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) in order to limit the noise generated by the other ﬂuores - cent molecules present in solution [ 23 – 25 ] . When actin assembly from the micropatterned area reached a steady state , we added 2 - m M Alexa - 488 - labeled yeast ADF / co - ﬁlin to the reaction mixture ( Figure 1D ) . Although ADF / coﬁlin in - teracted with all actin networks , it bound more sparsely on the Arp2 / 3 networks than on the different populations of cables ( Fig - ures 1D and S1A ) . Binding of ADF / coﬁlin was correlated with a decrease of the actin ﬂuorescence signal , corresponding to actin disassembly ( Figure S1B ) . The level of disassembly was archi - tecture dependent . Indeed , the actin ﬂuorescence signal after 450 s had decreased more on branched networks than on paral - lel cables or on cables of mixed polarity ( Figures 1D , S1B , and S1C ) . Experiments performed at different concentrations of ADF / coﬁlin revealed that even for equivalent binding densities of ADF / coﬁlin , branched actin networks disassembled better than all the actin cables ( Figure S1C ) . Together , these results indicate a strong dependence of the actin architectures in ADF / coﬁlin - driven actin network disassembly . ADF / coﬁlin bind - ing is able to destabilize branched networks but is not sufﬁcient to disassemble bare parallel or antiparallel bundles . ADF / Coﬁlin and Aip1 Collaborate to Disassemble Actin Networks Rapidly and Completely Genetic and biochemical observations indicate that additional disassembly factors , including Aip1 , cooperate with ADF / coﬁlin in vivo [ 9 – 11 , 13 , 18 , 26 ] . Therefore , we tested the synergy be - tween ADF / coﬁlin and Aip1 on actin network disassembly ( Fig - ure 2A ) . In our experimental system , Aip1 alone was able to bind slowly and homogenously to actin networks ( Figures S2A and S2B ) , but it did not contribute to their disassembly , as re - vealed by constant ﬂuorescence actin intensity ( Figure S2C ) . The presence of ADF / coﬁlin on actin networks accelerated the binding of Aip1 ( Figures 2B and S2B and Movie S2 ) . In these conditions , Aip1 was able to trigger the disassembly of all actin networks , including parallel and antiparallel actin organizations . Actin network disassembly was very rapid , as > 98 % of the actin ﬂuorescence signal had disappeared after 20 s . The ﬂuo - rescence signal of Aip1 was correlated with the amount of ADF / coﬁlin bound to actin networks during disassembly ( Fig - ure 2B ) . This suggests that the simultaneous presence of actin and ADF / coﬁlin is required for a fast and efﬁcient binding of Aip1 to actin networks and their disassembly . We compared the previous experimental situation , where Aip1 disassembles ADF / coﬁlin bound actin networks ( Figures 2 and S2C ) , with an experimental condition in which ADF / coﬁlin and Aip1 are introduced simultaneously ( Figure S3 ) . While the extent of disassembly is equivalent for both conditions , disassembly occurred over several minutes , on average 15 times more slowly . This suggests that the binding of ADF / coﬁlin to actin networks is the limiting factor for fast disassembly in this system . Severing of Actin Filaments Requires the Clustering of a Threshold Number of ADF / Coﬁlin Molecules Our observations performed at the whole - network level indicate that ADF / coﬁlin binding is a pre - requisite for the Aip1 - enhanced disassembly of actin structures . Therefore , a deeper under - standing of how actin networks are disassembled by the coor - dination of ADF / coﬁlin and Aip1 must come from single - ﬁla - ment - scale observations . For that purpose , we updated our TIRFM setup to the observation of single molecules [ 27 ] . Calibration of the ﬂuorescence intensity of individual Alexa mol - ecules was performed prior to every experiment , with the mea - surement of the ﬂuorescence intensity loss of molecules bound to the coverslips during their photobleaching ( Figure S4 ) . As a control of our measurement , we compared the average intensity of individual Alexa - labeled actin monomers with the total inten - sity of actin ﬁlaments with different degrees of labeling ( data not shown ) . We focused our analysis ﬁrst on the effect of ADF / coﬁlin on actin ﬁlaments . ADF / coﬁlin binds cooperatively to the side of actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 3A , white arrows ; [ 6 , 8 , 28 ] ) . At a low con - centration of ADF / coﬁlin ( 180 nM ; Movie S3 ) , the accumulation of ADF / coﬁlin was slow ( about 1 . 4 molecules , min (cid:1) 1 ) , reaching a maximum of 5 ± 1 molecules , and fragmentation of the ﬁla - ments rarely occurred ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . At an intermediate concentration of ADF / coﬁlin ( 360 nM ; Movie S4 ) , it accumulated faster ( 32 ± 18 molecules , min (cid:1) 1 ) , and fragmentation occurred when the intensity of the ADF / coﬁlin spots reached a threshold level ( Figure 3A , blue arrows ; Figure 3B ) . We quantiﬁed the in - tensity of the spots on the last images before fragmentation , and determined that a number of N c = 23 ± 8 ADF / coﬁlins was necessary at the time of severing ( Figure 3C ) . At a high concen - tration of ADF / coﬁlin ( 2 m M ) , growing actin ﬁlaments were fully decorated with ADF / coﬁlin and were resistant to fragmentation as described previously in the literature ( Figure 3A , Movie S5 , and [ 2 , 29 ] ) . Actin Filament Severing by ADF / Coﬁlin Is Polarized When we performed actin ﬁlament severing experiments at an intermediate concentration of ADF / coﬁlin ( 360 nM ) , we noticed that fragmentation events occurred systematically in a polarized manner ( Figure 3A , blue arrows ) . In other words , for every part of the ﬁlaments decorated by a stretch of ADF / coﬁlin , severing systematically occurred at one of the boundaries between deco - rated and bare sections of the ﬁlaments . After severing , one frag - ment remained practically free of ADF / coﬁlin at its severed end ( < 4 % of the ADF / coﬁlin present before severing ) , while the other 2 Current Biology 25 , 1 – 11 , June 1 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved Please cite this article in press as : Gressin et al . , Architecture Dependence of Actin Filament Network Disassembly , Current Biology ( 2015 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . cub . 2015 . 04 . 011 A D B C Figure 1 .

After many severing events , a large number of fragments decorated with a stretch ADF / coﬁlin at one of their ends remained on the coverslips ( Fig - ure 3D ) . Photobleaching ( FRAP ) of the ADF / coﬁlin stretches showed an absence of ﬂuorescence recovery ( Figure 3E ) . This indicates that ADF / coﬁlin molecules are bound to actin ﬁlaments for long periods of time , without any exchange with the ADF / coﬁlin molecules in solution [ 6 , 8 ] . Next , we aimed to determine the nature of the actin ﬁlament ends after fragmentation . We imaged the elongation of the frag - ments , and we observed that actin monomer addition always occurred at the end of the ﬁlaments that was left free of ADF / coﬁlin ( Figures 3F and 3G ) . Altogether , these observations indi - cate that the fragmentation of actin ﬁlaments by ADF / coﬁlin is a polarized event . After severing , the ADF / coﬁlin molecules remain on the pointed end of the new fragments , whereas the barbed ends are bare and free to elongate . The Number of ADF / Coﬁlin Bound to Actin Regulates Aip1 - Induced Disassembly We focused next on the effect of Aip1 at the ﬁlament scale . We polymerized actin ﬁlaments in the presence of different concen - trations of ADF / coﬁlin for 5 min , and then injected 1 - m M Aip1 ( Figure 4A ) . Our results indicate that the number of ADF / coﬁlin molecules that accumulated along the actin ﬁlaments modulated the activity of Aip1 . In the absence or at a low concentration of ADF / coﬁlin , Aip1 did not show any effect , and ADF / coﬁlin stretches remained stable along the actin ﬁlaments over long pe - riods of time ( > 2 min ) ( Figures 4B and 4C and Movie S6 ) . At an intermediate concentration of ADF / coﬁlin , Aip1 did not catalyze the severing reaction ( Figure 4D ) . However , when a severing event occurred , we observed a progressive decrease of the number of ADF / coﬁlins bound at the pointed ends of the actin fragment ( Figures 4B and 4C and Movie S7 ) . Since the ADF / coﬁlin stretches are stable in the absence of Aip1 , this decrease indicates that Aip1 unloads several ADF / coﬁlin molecules from A B Figure 2 .

The length of the ﬁla - ments was comparable for concentrations of ADF / coﬁlin up to 300 nM , whether Aip1 was present in solution or not . However , the length of the ﬁlaments rapidly dropped to sizes below the diffraction limit of our microscope for higher concentrations of ADF / coﬁlin in the presence of Aip1 ( Figure 4D ) . The effect of Aip1 on ADF / coﬁlin - bound actin ﬁlaments was dose dependent . Indeed , a low concentration of Aip1 ( 5 nM ) changed the kinetic of actin ﬁlament disassembly , but not its extent ( Figure S5 ) . Slower disassembly allowed us to track the fate of the disassembling ﬁlaments . We observed a frequent severing of the ﬁlaments until they were too short to be de - tected , but we did not convincingly observe any fast depolymer - ization or bursting of the ﬁlaments ends as previously reported [ 18 , 30 ] . We also performed these experiments with various concentra - tions of Alexa - labeled Aip1 , but we failed to detect any interac - tion of Aip1 with either ADF / coﬁlin or single actin ﬁlaments prior to disassembly ( data not shown ) . This suggests that a very tran - sient interaction of a low number of Aip1 molecules with ADF / co - ﬁlin and / or actin is sufﬁcient to trigger the disassembly of the ﬁlaments . Effect of ADF / Coﬁlin and Aip1 on Actin Filaments Barbed Ends In the past , a number of genetic and biochemical observations suggested that ADF / coﬁlin and Aip1 may have the ability to inhibit the elongation of actin ﬁlament barbed ends [ 11 , 31 , 32 ] . However , whether these two proteins are sufﬁcient for this effect remains controversial [ 17 , 18 , 33 ] . A difﬁculty in detecting such an inhibition arises from the simultaneous efﬁciency of ADF / co - ﬁlin and Aip1 in disassembling ﬁlaments into non - polymerizable low - molecular - weight species [ 34 ] . Therefore , in this study , we could only test barbed - end capping on Alexa - 568 - actin ﬁla - ments pre - assembled in the presence of an intermediate con - centration of ADF / coﬁlin ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . Although simulta - neous addition of Alexa - 647 - actin monomers and 20 - nM capping protein induced a rapid and strong capping of the Alexa - 568 - actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 5A ) , simultaneous addition of Alexa - 647 - actin monomers and 1 - m M Aip1 ( which corresponds roughly to the concentration of Aip1 in cells [ 32 ] ) did not induce barbed - end capping , even at sites where fragmentation events occurred ( Figure 5B ) . In these conditions , the simultaneous pres - ence of ADF / coﬁlin and Aip1 did not modify the elongation rate of actin ﬁlaments ( data not shown ) . In vivo , capping protein sterically limits the barbed - end elon - gation of actin ﬁlaments before they are disassembled . Two pub - lications questioned a potential inhibitory effect of barbed - end capping for the fast disassembly of actin ﬁlaments , leading to contradictory results [ 30 , 33 ] . We tested this hypothesis in our system by adding capping protein to a solution of actin ﬁlaments polymerizinginthepresenceof2 - m MAlexa - 488 - coﬁlin ( Figure6 ) . We veriﬁed that actin ﬁlament elongation was interrupted before addition of Aip1 . Actin ﬁlaments disassembled in the presence of capping protein and in its absence , showing that barbed - end capping is not an obstacle to ﬁlament disassembly . DISCUSSION In this study , we have detailed the interplay between ADF / coﬁlin and Aip1 to disassemble actin , both at the ﬁlament scale and at the level of the different cellular actin organizations . Actin Disassembly and Network Architecture Speciﬁcities Several lines of evidence indicate that in vivo , disassembly fac - tors act on different actin networks with variable efﬁciency and provide disassembly rates over different time scales . One example comes from observations in yeast , which contain three types of actin organizations . At the cell cortex , endocytic actin patches are composed of Arp2 / 3 branched networks . Their average lifetime is about 15 s , with a disassembly phase of about 6 s [ 35 – 37 ] . Inside the cell body , actin cables are composed of short parallel actin ﬁlaments , mostly of identical orientations [ 38 ] . Actin cables are very dynamic and disappear within sec - onds [ 36 , 39 ] . At the division site , a cytokinetic ring is composed of short parallel actin ﬁlaments , with identical orientations or mixed polarities depending on the stage of cell division [ 40 ] . Most recent works indicate turnover values for the ring ranging from 11 s to several minutes [ 36 , 41 , 42 ] . ADF / coﬁlin and Aip1 are mainly detected on actin patches , indicating an apparent af - ﬁnity of these proteins that is higher for branched networks than for linear networks [ 10 , 43 ] . Interestingly , depletion of Aip1 in budding yeast partially relocalizes ADF / coﬁlin from actin patches to cables . In these mutants , decoration of actin cables by ADF / coﬁlin is correlated with their stabilization [ 10 , 13 ] . These cellular observations indicate the existence of important rules linking actin structural organization with its disassembly . Previous works have demonstrated that the effects of actin bind - ing proteins are not necessarily the same when they interact with A B Figure 5 .

Therefore , we hypothesized that network geomet - rical organization could be one of the key parameters to explain how actin disassembly is regulated in cells . Our results now indi - cate that ADF / coﬁlin binding to actin is architecture dependent ( Figures 1 and 7A ) . ADF / coﬁlin can disassemble branched actin networks but is unable to disassemble parallel cables or cables of mixed polarity . A probable explanation arises from the fact that ADF / coﬁlin’s binding accelerates the debranching of the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 45 , 46 ] , which is expected to induce a progres - sive loss of structural integrity of branched networks and their faster dismantling ( Figure 7A ) . However , even for branched actin networks , ADF / coﬁlin is unable to fully convert actin networks into actin monomers . At steady state , a population of fragments loaded with ADF / coﬁlin remains stable over long periods of time ( Figures 1 and 7A ) . Moreover , on parallel cables or cables of mixed polarity , ADF / coﬁlin induces only a marginal disassembly and these structures remain highly decorated by ADF / coﬁlin . In previous studies , this effect has been proposed to have a phys - iological relevance for the stabilization of some cellular actin structures [ 2 ] . Our work now suggests that ADF / coﬁlin loading on to actin ﬁlaments could also be an essential prerequisite for Aip1 - mediated actin disassembly . From these results , we can now propose a simple interpretation of the aip1 D phenotypes observed in cells . Our explanation is that ADF / coﬁlin - loaded actin cables become unable to disassemble in the absence of Aip1 , whereas actin patches may still use debranching as an efﬁ - cient alternative for disassembly . New Insights about the Interaction of ADF / Coﬁlin with Actin Filaments At the ﬁlament scale , we found unexpected properties of ADF / coﬁlin’s interaction with actin . Our single - molecule detection im - aging capacity enabled us to quantify the number of ADF / coﬁlin molecules bound to the side of actin ﬁlaments in real time . We demonstrate that severing induced by ADF / coﬁlin is a much more efﬁcient and regulated mechanism than previously thought . We measured that a minimal cluster of 23 ADF / coﬁlin molecules along an actin ﬁlament is necessary for efﬁcient severing ( Figures 3 and 7B ) . A large body of literature details how the binding of ADF / coﬁlin to actin ﬁlaments modiﬁes their ul - tra - structural and - mechanical properties [ 6 , 7 , 47 , 48 ] . We pro - pose that a threshold number of 23 ADF / coﬁlin molecules in a cluster is required to trigger a conformational change on actin ﬁl - aments and to provide enough mechanical stress for their frag - mentation ( Figure 7B ) . Moreover , the dissymmetry in severing suggests that the me - chanical stress created by the ADF / coﬁlin stretches is polarized . These results are in line with observations performed at the ultra - structural level . High - speed atomic force microscopy has recently revealed that the helical pitch of ADF / coﬁlin - decorated actin ﬁlaments is 25 % shorter compared to bare ﬁlaments [ 49 ] . This conformational change is only propagated to the neigh - boring bare segments on the pointed end side of the clusters , but not on the barbed - end side . Consequently , this study found that ADF / coﬁlin clusters only grow toward the pointed end of actin ﬁlaments . This observation explains why clusters do not accumulate more ADF / coﬁlin molecules at the pointed ends of the fragments after a successful severing event in our experiments . A Step Forward in our Understanding of Actin Filament Disassembly by ADF / Coﬁlin and Aip1 ADF / coﬁlin and Aip1 work in tandem to fully disassemble any type of actin organization . In this study , we used triple - color sin - gle - molecule imaging to dissect the effect of Aip1 on individual actin ﬁlaments decorated by variable numbers of ADF / coﬁlin molecules ( Figure 4 ) . We have integrated our results into a model based on the observation that Aip1 requires the same minimal stretch of 23 ADF / coﬁlins bound to actin ﬁlaments to disas - semble them efﬁciently ( Figure 7B ) . We propose that Aip1 - stim - ulated disassembly requires the conformational change on actin ﬁlaments induced by a minimal local density of ADF / coﬁlin . In this model , actin ﬁlaments or higher - ordered organizations fully decorated by ADF / coﬁlin become ideal substrates for Aip1 . How destabilization of actin ﬁlaments by Aip1 occurs remains to be determined at the structural level , but an interesting hy - pothesis is that actin ﬁlaments could disassemble through Figure 6 .

Models for the Disassembly of Actin by ADF / Coﬁlin and Aip1 ( A ) Disassemblyatthewhole - networkscale : architecturedependence . Inthismodel , bindingofADF / coﬁlintoactincablesdoesnottriggertheirdisassembly , but switches actin ﬁlaments ( blue ﬁlaments ) to a pre - disassembly state ( red ﬁlaments ) ( top ) . However , ADF / coﬁlin has an important effect for the dismantling of branched networks , through its de - branching activity ( bottom ) . For all actin networks , presence of Aip1 turns these stable ADF / coﬁlin - decorated structures into unstable assemblies , prone to stochastic disassembly . ( B ) Severing and disassembly at the single - ﬁlament scale . In this model , binding of ADF / coﬁlin needs to reach a threshold level of 23 molecules to trigger a conformational change of the ﬁlaments ( represented by a change in their color , from blue to red ) . At a low concentration of ADF / coﬁlin ( left ) , the threshold level is not reached . At an intermediate concentration of ADF / coﬁlin ( center ) , actin ﬁlaments decorated by sub - stoichiometric densities of ADF / coﬁlin but with N > 23 ( legend continued on next page ) Current Biology 25 , 1 – 11 , June 1 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 9 Please cite this article in press as : Gressin et al . , Architecture Dependence of Actin Filament Network Disassembly , Current Biology ( 2015 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . cub . 2015 . 04 . 011 cooperative strand separation [ 30 ] . Such mechanism was described to induce in vitro shortening of actin ﬁlaments by bursts at their ends . In our work , we have not been able to detect any bursting event from the ends of the ﬁlaments and capping protein was not an inhibitor of disassembly . Therefore , our re - sults do not support the existence of any end bursting for the fast disassembly of yeast actin ﬁlaments , although we do not rule out the possibility that bursting could come from some iso - form speciﬁcity . Nevertheless , the fact that Aip1 is sufﬁcient in our system to induce a disassembly of actin networks at cellular rates does not support the necessity of any end bursting to describe the synergy between ADF / coﬁlin and Aip1 .
