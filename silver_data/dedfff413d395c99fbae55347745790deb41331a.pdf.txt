Recent studies identiﬁed a correlation between the orienta - tion of CTCF - binding sites ( CBSs ) and chromatin loops . To test the functional signiﬁcance of this obser - vation , we combined CRISPR / Cas9 - based genomic - DNA - fragment editing with chromosome - conforma - tion - capture experiments to show that the location and relative orientations of CBSs determine the spec - iﬁcity of long - range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes , using protocadherin ( Pcdh ) and b - globin as model genes . Inversion of CBS elements within the Pcdh enhancer reconﬁgures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters and alters gene - expression pat - terns . Thus , although enhancers can function in an orientation - independent manner in reporter assays , in the native chromosome context , the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying CBSs can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin do - mains and enhancer / promoter speciﬁcity . These ﬁnd - ings reveal how 3D chromosome architecture can be encoded by linear genome sequences . INTRODUCTION Interphase chromosomes fold into highly compartmentalized , hi - erarchical structures , and the topology of chromosome folding is thought to play an important role in critical nuclear processes , including the regulation of gene expression ( de Laat and Du - boule , 2013 ; Gibcus and Dekker , 2013 ; Levine et al . , 2014 ) . Individual chromosomes occupy a distinct space in the nu - cleus , referred to as a ‘‘chromosome territory’’ ( Cremer and Cremer , 2001 ) , and within this region are relatively stable chro - matin domains containing speciﬁc DNA - looping interactions between proximal promoters and distal regulatory DNA ele - ments , such as transcriptional enhancers and silencers , insula - tors , and locus control regions ( LCR ) ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Gibcus and Dekker , 2013 ; Levine et al . , 2014 ; Lieberman - Aiden et al . , 2009 ) . Genome - wide studies of mammalian genomes have shown that there are far more enhancers than promoters and that spatiotemporal gene expression is regulated through one or more promoters and multiple enhancers ( Bulger and Grou - dine , 2011 ; ENCODE Project Consortium , 2012 ; Zhang et al . , 2004 ) . Insulator elements play pivotal roles in orchestrating proper long - range DNA - looping interactions between remote enhancers and their cognate promoters via mechanisms that are poorly understood ( Dowen et al . , 2014 ; Jia et al . , 2014 ; Nar - endra et al . , 2015 ; Ong and Corces , 2014 ) . The mammalian CCCTC - binding factor ( CTCF ) , a zinc - ﬁnger DNA - binding protein , is the best characterized insulator - binding protein , which also plays a key role in genome looping ( Lobanen - kov et al . , 1990 ; Ong and Corces , 2014 ) . In addition , the insu - lator activity of CTCF - binding sites ( CBSs ) requires the cohesin complex that is recruited by CTCF . Previous studies have im - plicated CTCF and cohesin complexes in genome - wide chro - matin - looping interactions ( Handoko et al . , 2011 ; Zuin et al . , 2014 ) . Over 100 , 000 diverse CBSs have been identiﬁed in mammalian genomes ( Kim et al . , 2007 ; Shen et al . , 2012 ; Xie et al . , 2007 ) , and the genome - wide pattern of CTCF occupancy is cell - type speciﬁc ( Kim et al . , 2007 ; Shen et al . , 2012 ; Wang 900 Cell 162 , 900 – 910 , August 13 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . et al . , 2012 ) ; however , CBSs are enriched at constitutive bound - aries of topologically associated domains ( TADs ) ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Gibcus and Dekker , 2013 ; Zuin et al . , 2014 ) . More recently , it was shown that CBSs at the anchors of chromatin loops are ar - ranged in the forward - reverse orientations , suggesting that the relative positions and orientations of CBSs could be important for chromosome architecture ( Alt et al . , 2013 ; Guo et al . , 2012 ; Monahan et al . , 2012 ; Rao et al . , 2014 ; Vietri Rudan et al . , 2015 ) . However , the underlying molecular mechanisms through which CTCF - mediated DNA - looping interactions lead to CTCF’s many cellular functions remain obscure . The mammalian protocadherin ( Pcdh ) a , b , and g gene clus - ters provide a unique model system to investigate the role of CTCF / cohesin - mediated enhancer - promoter interactions in cell - speciﬁc gene expression ( Guo et al . , 2012 ; Hirayama et al . , 2012 ; Monahan et al . , 2012 ; Wu and Maniatis , 1999 ) . In the a and g ( but not the b ) clusters , the Pcdh ‘‘variable regions’’ contain more than a dozen large and highly similar ‘‘alternately ex - pressed’’ variable exons followed by two or three ‘‘ubiquitously expressed’’ C - type variable exons in the a and g clusters , respectively ( Figure 1A ) . By contrast , the downstream ‘‘constant regions’’ of the a and g clusters are organized into three small exons that encode the intracellular domain of all of the protein isoforms in each cluster ( Figure 1A ) ( Wu and Maniatis , 1999 ) . Pre - vious studies revealed that each ‘‘variable’’ exon ( except a c2 , b 1 , g c4 , and g c5 ) is preceded by a promoter containing a highly conserved sequence element ( CSE ) ( Figure 1A ) ( Tasic et al . , 2002 ; Wu et al . , 2001 ) . Subsequently , CTCF was shown to bind to the CSE and to a second CBS within the downstream exon ( eCBS ) of transcriptionally active a genes , and this binding is required for transcription ( Guo et al . , 2012 ; Hirayama et al . , 2012 ; Monahan et al . , 2012 ; Wu et al . , 2001 ) . A key observation , relevant to the present study , was that the CBSs in the Pcdh HS5 - 1 enhancer downstream of the a cluster and in each of the promoters and downstream exons are conﬁg - ured in opposite orientations ( Guo et al . , 2012 ) . Chromosome conformation capture ( 3C ) studies revealed that CTCF / cohe - sin - mediated DNA looping occurs exclusively between paired CBSs within the enhancers and the active promoters ( Guo et al . , 2012 ) . This organization of CBS sites within the Pcdh clus - ters was recently shown to reﬂect the genome - wide organization of CBS pairs at anchors of DNA contact loops ( Alt et al . , 2013 ; Rao et al . , 2014 ; Vietri Rudan et al . , 2015 ) . This striking organiza - tion of oriented CBS sites in Pcdh clusters and the availability of powerful CRISPR genome editing methods provide the opportu - nity to address the functional signiﬁcance of the genome - wide CBS organization . Here , we provide direct functional evidence that the location and relative orientations of CBSs play a critical role in the estab - lishment of chromosome architecture and proper enhancer - promoter interactions . We developed a CRISPR / Cas9 - based DNA - fragment in situ inversion technology ( Li et al . , 2015 ) —in conjunction with 3C , as well as related 4C ( circularized 3C ) and Hi - C methods ( Dekker et al . , 2002 ) —to study the chromatin or - ganization in the Pcdh clusters . We ﬁnd that directional CTCF binding to the paired CBSs with a speciﬁc combination of for - ward - reverse orientations determines the formation of speciﬁc DNA - looping interactions between enhancers and promoters in mammalian cells . The generality of this observation is demon - strated by showing that the same mechanism operates with CBSs in the b - globin gene cluster and throughout mammalian genomes . This mechanism of CTCF - determined looping direc - tions has important implications regarding chromosomal archi - tecture and the insulator functions of genome - wide CBSs in genome folding and gene regulation . RESULTS Two CTCF / Cohesin - Mediated Chromatin Domains in the Pcdh Locus We used 3C , 4C , and Hi - C to study CTCF / cohesin - mediated DNA looping and chromatin organization in the Pcdh a , b , and g clusters ( Figures 1A – 1G and S1 ) . Speciﬁcally , we performed 4C using the HS5 - 1 enhancer , the a promoters , or the region immediately upstream of the a cluster as anchors and showed that promoters within the a cluster interact with HS5 - 1 in human SK - N - SH cells ( Figure 1B ) and mouse neuro2A ( N2A ) cells ( Fig - ure 1C ) and brain tissues ( Figures 1D , S1A , and S1B ) . By contrast , the downstream promoters of the b cluster display virtually no interactions with HS5 - 1 ( Figures 1B – 1D ) . We also performed 4C using promoters of the g cluster as an - chors and identiﬁed a downstream regulatory region ( Figures S1C – S1E ) . This region contains a cluster of CBSs ( CBS sites a – h ) located within several DNaseI HS sites ( see Figures 1A and S1F ) and is enriched with molecular marks typical of en - hancers ( Figure S1G ) ( ENCODE Project Consortium , 2012 ) . Similar to the a cluster , this downstream regulatory region inter - acts with promoters of the g cluster in human SK - N - SH cells ( Figure 1E ) , as well as in mouse N2A cells ( Figure 1F ) and brain tissues ( Figure 1G ) . Interestingly , promoters of the b cluster also interacted with this remote enhancer when the b promoters were used as 4C anchors ( Figures S1H and S1I ) , which is consis - tent with the previous observation that this region is required for maximum levels of b gene expression and regulates the g cluster ( Yokota et al . , 2011 ) . Finally , we performed Hi - C experiments on SK - N - SH and analyzed the results along with previously pub - lished Hi - C data from H1 - hESC and NPC cells ( Dixon et al . , 2012 , 2015 ) ( Figure S1J ) . We observed two TAD - like chromatin domains covering a and bg clusters , respectively , by calculating adirectionality index withasliding window of300kb ( Figure S1J ) . Taken together , these data show that the HS5 - 1 enhancer forms a CTCF / cohesin - mediated chromatin domain ( CCD ) within the a cluster , and the bg - regulatory region forms a CCD that includes both the b and g clusters ( Figure 1A ) . Non - random CBS Orientations in the Two Pcdh CCDs A CBS motif is located within all of the Pcdh a , b , and g promoters , except a c 2 , b 1 , g c4 , and g c5 ( Figure 1A ) ( Guo et al . , 2012 ; Kim et al . , 2007 ; Monahan et al . , 2012 ; Nakahashi et al . , 2013 ; Rhee and Pugh , 2011 ; Schmidt et al . , 2012 ; Wu et al . , 2001 ) . We deﬁned the CBS from modules 1 to 4 as be - ing in the forward orientation ( Figure 1H ) . Interestingly , all of the a CSEs and eCBSs are in the forward orientation ; by contrast , both HS5 - 1 CBSs ( HS5 - 1a and b ) are in the reverse orientation within the a CCD ( Figure 1A ) . Similarly , all of the bg CSEs are in the for - ward orientation , whereas the ﬁrst ﬁve CBSs ( a – e ) in the bg Cell 162 , 900 – 910 , August 13 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . 901 enhancer complex are in the reverse orientation within the bg CCD ( Figures 1A and S1F ) . The last three CBSs ( f – h ) downstream of the bg - regulatory region are in different orientations , and they do not interact with the bg promoters ( see Figures 1A and S1C – S1F ) . Thus , the Pcdh chromatin - looping interactions occur between CBS pairs in the forward - reverse orientations in the promoters and enhancers , respectively ( Figure 1A ) . Previously reported weak DNA - looping interactions between two CBSs in the same orientation in the a promoter region may be the conse - quence of their interactions with common CBSs within the HS5 - 1 A B C D E F G H Figure 1 .

Overall , these observations strongly suggest that the relative orientations of CBSs determine the topology of CTCF / cohesin - mediated DNA looping ( Alt et al . , 2013 ; Guo et al . , 2012 ; Rao et al . , 2014 ; Vietri Rudan et al . , 2015 ) . In Situ Inversion of the Boundary CBS Element Alters DNA Looping and Gene Expression To directly determine whether CBS orientation is important for enhancer - promoter interactions and DNA looping , we used an efﬁcient in situ CRISPR inversion of DNA fragment editing method we recently developed ( Li et al . , 2015 ) to invert the core HS5 - 1 element in its endogenous chromosomal location . We screened for CRISPR inversion cell clones derived from HEC - 1B cells , which have three alleles at the Pcdh locus ( Li A B C D Figure 2 .

See also Figure S2 . et al . , 2015 ) and express a subset of the a ( Tasic et al . , 2002 ) and g clusters ( Fig - ure S1F , also see Figure 2D , below ) . Out of 32 clones that were genotyped , we identiﬁed a cell clone ( V28 ) in which the orientation of HS5 - 1 was inverted for two alleles and deleted for one allele ( Fig - ure S2A ) . We then performed 4C using HS5 - 1 as an anchor . Strikingly , we observed a signiﬁcant increase in DNA - looping interactions between HS5 - 1 and promoters in the bg clusters ( from 28 % to 79 % ) and a corresponding decrease in DNA - looping interactions with the pro - moters driving the expression of the alter - nate Pcdh a isoforms ( from 72 % to 21 % ) ( Figure 2A ) . We conﬁrmed these changes in DNA looping by quantitative 3C assays ( Figure 2B ) . Chromatin immunoprecipita - tion ( ChIP ) - qPCR studies showed that CTCF binds to the inverted HS5 - 1 element ; however , a signiﬁcant decrease in the binding of the cohesin subunit Rad21 to this sequence was observed ( Figure 2C ) . We conclude that inversion of the oriented CBSs in the HS5 - 1 enhancer profoundly alters enhancer - promoter interactions in the Pcdh clusters . To assess the effects of these alterations , we carried out an RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) analysis on the HEC - 1B cells in which the HS5 - 1 enhancer is inverted . As shown in Figure 2D , the decrease of DNA looping between HS5 - 1 and a promoters resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in a transcription . However , a corresponding enhancement in b transcription was not observed in spite of the observed increase of interactions between the in - verted HS5 - 1 enhancer and the b cluster . Similarly , a reduction of g transcription ( except an increase of g c3 ) was also observed Cell 162 , 900 – 910 , August 13 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . 903 ( Figure 2D ) . Thus , the inappropriate engagement of the HS5 - 1 enhancer with the downstream b and g clusters appears to disrupt rather than enhance transcription . The function of enhancers tested in mammalian cell transfec - tion experiments with reporter genes is independent of the rela - tive orientations of the enhancer and promoter ( Banerji et al . , 1981 ) . However , the data of Figures 1 and 2 clearly show that the activity and speciﬁcity of enhancers in their normal chro - mosomal context are highly orientation speciﬁc , likely as a con - sequence of differences in the altered organization of CCDs caused by the DNA sequence inversion . Directional CTCF Binding to Pcdh CBS Sequences A large number of palindromic CBSs have been identiﬁed in the human genome ( Xie et al . , 2007 ) , and yet , intriguingly , CTCF binds to CBSs in a preferred orientation ( Nakahashi et al . , 2013 ; Renda et al . , 2007 ; Schmidt et al . , 2012 ) . How CTCF binds directionally to large numbers of diverse and seem - ingly palindromic CBSs therefore remains a mystery . Careful examination of the 17 bp core sequences of the HS5 - 1b CBS revealed that they are perfectly palindromic ( Figure 3A ) . Consid - ering that the reverse - complement sequences also conform to the CTCF - binding consensus , one would expect that CTCF rec - ognizes HS5 - 1b in both directions , thus eliminating the apparent asymmetry of CBS pairs in the a promoters and the HS5 - 1 enhancer . To investigate whether CTCF binding to the HS5 - 1b CBS is directional , we generated three DNA probes bearing combined 2 bp mutations designed to distinguish between the two putative CTCF - binding directions ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . We also generated a series of 17 CTCF expression constructs en - coding two sets of truncated CTCFs in which each zinc ﬁnger ( ZF ) domain was sequentially deleted from either the C or N ter - minus ( Figures 3C and S3A ) . Remarkably , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) ex - periments revealed that CTCF recognizes palindromic HS5 - 1b in only one direction relative to its sequences because mutation of ‘‘GG’’ to ‘‘tt’’ ( mut1 and mut3 , Figures 3A and 3B ) abolished CTCF binding ( lanes 2 and 6 , Figure 3D ) whereas mutation of ‘‘CC’’ to ‘‘aa’’ ( mut2 , Figures 3A and 3B ) did not abolish CTCF binding ( lane 4 , Figure 3D ) . To further investigate the directional CTCF recognition , we generated combinations of these muta - tions with 3 bp mutations in the HS5 - 1b module 1 ( mut5 and mut6 with mut4 as the control , Figure 3B ) . We found that the ﬁrst three nucleotides of module 1 are recognized by the C - terminal ZF11 , and this recognition determines the direction of CTCF binding to the CBS with palindromic core sequences ( Figures 3E and 3F ) . In particular , introduction of mutations into the ﬁrst tri - nucleotide from ‘‘AGC’’ to ‘‘cta’’ did not alter the binding to ZF6 - 10 ( compare lanes 6 and 5 in Figure 3E ) but did reduce the binding of ZF6 - 11 to levels similar to those of ZF6 - 10 ( compare lanes 4 and 3 with lanes 5 and 6 in Figure 3E ) . Thus , the C - terminal ZF11 of CTCF determines its directional binding to the HS5 - 1b CBS with palindromic core sequences , suggest - ing that module 1 is the key directional element in CBSs with palindromic core sequences . To further determine the directionality of CTCF binding at the Pcdh CBS repertoire and the recognition proﬁle of the 11 ZF do - mains of CTCF , we mutated distinct sets of 3 bp sequences in A B C D E F Figure 3 .

We found that the C - terminal ZF domains of CTCF recognize module 1 of the CBS and that the N - terminal ZF domains recognize mod - ule 4 ( Figures S3C – S3W ) . For example , CTCF ZF3 and ZF2 recognize the CGC and TGT tri - nucleotides of the a 8 CBS , respectively , because mutations of these tri - nucleotides reduced CTCF binding only when ZF3 and ZF2 were present ( Figures S3B – S3F ) . In addition , module 2 of the b 3 CBS appears to be bound by CTCF ZF6 / 7 ( Figures S3B and S3G – S3I ) . More - over , CTCF ZF2 - 11 and ZF4 - 11 are essential for binding the CSE of g a10 ( Figures S3B , S3J , S3K , and S3N ) and g b7 ( Figures S3B , S3L , and S3N ) , respectively . In particular , ZF11 of CTCF is abso - lutely required for CTCF binding of the CSE of g a10 and g b7 , as deletion of ZF11 abolished CTCF binding to these two CBSs ( Figures S3J and S3L ) . Furthermore , CTCF ZF11 recognizes the ﬁrst tri - nucleotide TGC in module 1 of the bg - b CBS ( Figures S3B , S3M , and S3N ) . Finally , we show that different types of Pcdh CBSs are recognized by distinct combinations of the CTCF ZF domains ( Figures S3O – S3W ) . Taken together , these observations clearly show that CTCF recognizes CBSs in only one direction relative to its target se - quences and that distinct combinations of CTCF ZF domains recognize different types of Pcdh CBSs . Thus , the conﬁguration of directional CTCF binding determines the topology of CTCF / cohesin - mediated DNA looping in the Pcdh clusters . Although the nature of the interactions between CTCF / cohesin complexes on the active Pcdh alternate promoters and the HS5 - 1 enhancer is not known , these observations suggest that functional interac - tions require directional binding of CTCF / cohesin in the forward - reverse orientations to the Pcdh CBS pairs . Directional CTCF Binding in Genome - wide DNA Looping Speciﬁcity Recent whole - genome Hi - C experiments revealed that the vast majority of DNA loops correlate with the presence of CBS pairs arranged in a convergent orientation ( Rao et al . , 2014 ; Vietri Rudan et al . , 2015 ) . However , because chromatin contacts detected by Hi - C are unbiased and do not speciﬁcally relate to CTCF / cohesin binding , these loops may or may not be established by CTCF and the associated cohesin complex . Based on our observations that directional CTCF binding to for - ward - reverse CBS pairs determines topological looping do - mains in the Pcdh clusters , we investigated genome - wide CBS orientation and CTCF / cohesin - mediated DNA - looping topology by analyzing published datasets of chromatin interaction anal - ysis by paired - end tag sequencing ( ChIA - PET ) and ChIP - seq with speciﬁc CTCF / cohesin antibodies ( ENCODE Project Con - sortium , 2012 ; Handoko et al . , 2011 ) . We ﬁrst determined the ori - entations of 88 , 332 CBSs and their CTCF occupancies in K562 cells ( Table S1 ) using position weight matrices ( PWM ) ( Schmidt et al . , 2012 ) . We then screened for ChIA - PET interactions ( from a total of 24 , 887 ) in which both tethered DNA fragments contain CBSs and identiﬁed 19 , 532 such interactions ( Figure 4A and Ta - ble S2 ) . We found that 76 . 4 % of the CTCF - mediated interactions ( 14 , 928 ) are in the forward - reverse orientations ; by contrast , only 2 . 3 % ( 443 ) are in the reverse - forward orientations . In addition , 11 . 0 % of the interactions ( 2 , 155 ) are in the forward - forward ori - entations and 10 . 3 % ( 2 , 006 ) are in the reverse - reverse orienta - tions . Finally , we measured the chromatin - looping strength by counting the number of overlapped looping PETs of the ChIA - PET datasets . Interestingly , the percentages of CBS pairs in the forward - reverse orientations dramatically increased with enhanced chromatin - looping strength ( Figure 4B and Table S3 ) . Similar results were observed in data collected from mouse E14 embryonic stem cells ( Table S2 ) ( Handoko et al . , 2011 ) and human MCF - 7 breast cancer cells ( Tables S1 and S2 ) . These observations clearly show that the majority of genome - wide chromatin - looping interactions correlate with directional CTCF binding to CBS pairs in the forward - reverse orientations . We previously demonstrated that CTCF and the cohesin com - plex colocalize to promoters and enhancers in the Pcdh clusters ( Monahan et al . , 2012 ; Guo et al . , 2012 ) . In order to investigate the relationship between the binding of CTCF and cohesin , CBS orientation , and DNA looping , we identiﬁed chromatin - looping interactions containing CTCF / cohesin co - occupied CBSs in K562 cells . We found 16 , 610 such interactions , in which the majority ( 78 . 7 % ) occur between CBS pairs in the forward - reverse orientations ( Table S4 ) . In addition , we found that the tethered CBSs have a higher occupancy of CTCF and cohesin than the non - tethered CBSs ( Figure S4A ) , suggesting that high levels of CTCF / cohesin co - occupancy at CBSs are required for establishing these long - range chromatin - looping interactions . Thus , in addition to the location and orientation of CBSs , levels of their CTCF / cohesin occupancy are also an important determi - nant for directional chromatin looping . Interestingly , in the K562 cell genome , 46 % of the p300 enhancer marks ( Heintzman et al . , 2007 ) have at least one CBS located within 2 kb ( Figure S4B ) . On the other hand , 54 % of the marks of the silencer factor REST / NRSF ( Johnson et al . , 2007 ) have at least one CBS located within 2 kb ( Figure S4C ) . These ob - servations suggest that CTCF / cohesin - mediated DNA - looping interaction may enhance or inhibit gene expression , depending on the proximity of the CBS to p300 or REST / NRSF . This possibil - ity is consistent with the observation that a REST / NRSF binding site in HS5 - 1 is required for repression of the a cluster in non - neuronal cells ( Kehayova et al . , 2011 ) . We next identiﬁed genome - wide overlapping CTCF / cohesin - mediated chromatin - looping interactions and merged clusters of the overlapping interactions as single CCDs . The two CCDs in the HoxD locus are shown as examples in Figure 4C . The cu - mulative features of CBSs in the looping PETs of all human CCDs demonstrate that most CBSs are located near the boundaries ( Figure 4D and Tables S4 and S5 ) . By analyzing the orientations of the boundary CBS pairs between neighboring CCDs , we found that the vast majority ( 90 . 0 % ) of the boundary CBS pairs between neighboring CCDs in K562 cells are in the reverse - for - ward orientations ( 1 , 626 ) ( Figure 4E and Tables S4 and S6 ) . Similar results were obtained for MCF - 7 cells ( Tables S4 , S5 , and S6 ) . Taken together , these genome - wide data suggest that directional CTCF binding to CBS pairs in the reverse - for - ward orientations at the boundary between neighboring CCDs is important for establishing distinct topological domains . Finally , because CBSs are enriched at the boundaries of TADs ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Shen et al . , 2012 ) , we analyzed the orienta - tions of CBSs of the TAD boundaries identiﬁed in H1 - hESC and IMR90 cells . We found that CBS pairs in the reverse - forward Cell 162 , 900 – 910 , August 13 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . 905 orientation exist in > 60 % neighboring TAD boundaries ( Fig - ure S4D ) , suggesting that the boundary reverse - forward CBS pairs play an important role in the formation of most of TADs . For example , there is a CBS pair in the reverse - forward orienta - tion in a Chr12 genomic region of H1 - hESC cells , located at or very close to each of the six TAD boundaries ( boundaries 1 – 6 ) , except for boundary 5 , which has only one closely located CBS in the forward orientation ( Figure S4E ) . These data , taken together , strongly suggest that directional binding of CTCF to boundary CBS pairs in the reverse - forward orientations causes opposite topological looping and thus appears to function as insulators . The Human b - globin Locus Provides an Additional Example of CBS Orientation - Dependent Topological Chromatin Looping Based on the location and orientation of CBSs , as well as their CTCF / cohesin occupancy , we identiﬁed four CCDs ( domains 1 – 4 ) in the well - characterized b - globin cluster ( Figure 5A ) . The b - globin gene cluster is located between CBS3 ( 5 0 HS5 ) and CBS4 ( 3 0 HS1 ) in domain1 ( Figure 5A ) ( Hou et al . , 2010 ; Splinter et al . , 2006 ) . We generated a series of CBS4 / 5 mutant K562 cell lines using CRISPR / Cas9 with one or two sgRNAs ( Li et al . , A B C D E Figure 4 .

The color charts represent 19 , 532 interactions of CBS pairs in K562 cells .

( D ) Cumulative patterns of CBS orientations of to - pological domains in the human genome . ( E ) Distribution of genome - wide orientation con - ﬁgurations of CBS pairs located in the boundaries between two neighboring domains in the human K562 genome . Note that the vast majority ( 90 . 0 % ) of boundary CBS pairs between two neighboring domains are in the reverse - forward orientation . See also Figure S4 and Tables S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 , S5 , and S6 . 2015 ) ( Figures S2B and S2C ) . In the CRISPR cell lines D3 , D7 , and D19 ( out of 38 clones screened ) in which the inter - nal CBS4 ( 3 0 HS1 ) was deleted ( Fig - ure S2B ) , chromatin - looping interactions between CBS3 ( 5 0 HS5 ) in the forward orientation and the boundary CBS5 in the reverse orientation in domain1 persisted , although its interaction with the CBS4 ( 3 0 HS1 ) region was abolished ( Figures S5A and S5B ) . As ex - pected , the interactions between CBS6 / 7 and CBS8 / 9 in domain2 were unchanged ( Figure S5C ) . Strikingly , however , in the CBS4 ( 3 0 HS1 ) and CBS5 double - knockout CRISPR cell lines C2 , C4 , and C14 ( out of 49 clones screened ) ( Figure S2C ) , novel chromatin - looping interactions between CBS3 ( 5 0 HS5 ) in the for - ward orientation of domain1 and CBS8 / 9 in the reverse orienta - tion of the neighboring domain2 were observed , suggesting that these two domains merge as a single domain in CRISPR cell lines with CBS4 / 5 double knockout ( Figure S5B ) . Similarly , when CBS8 was used as an anchor , this reverse - oriented CBS in domain2 establishes new long - range chromatin - looping inter - actions with CBS1 – 3 in the forward orientation of domain1 in the CBS4 / 5 double - deletion CRISPR cell lines ( Figure S5C ) . We conclude that cross - domain interactions can be established after deletion of CBSs up to the boundary of topological do - mains , but not after deletion of the internal CBS in the b - globin locus . To further test the functional signiﬁcance of this organization of CBSs , we again performed CRISPR / cas9 - mediated DNA - fragment editing in the HEK293T cells and screened 198 CRISPR 906 Cell 162 , 900 – 910 , August 13 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . cell clones for inversions of CBS13 – 15 , which is located at the boundary of domain3 ( Figure 5A ) , and obtained three CRISPR inversion cell clones ( E28 , E79 , and F6 ) ( Figure S2D ) . We then performed 4C using CBS13 – 15 as an anchor . Strikingly and similar to the inversion of the Pcdh domain boundary , we observed a signiﬁcant increase of chromatin - looping interac - tions with the downstream domain containing CBS16 – 18 ( from 43 % to 73 % ) and a corresponding decrease of chromatin - loop - ing interactions with the upstream domain containing CBS10 – 15 ( from 57 % to 27 % ) ( Figure 5B ) . These observations , taken together , clearly show that the orientations of CBSs determine the directionality of topological DNA looping . In summary , we ﬁnd that changing the relative orientations of CBS elements at domain boundaries by CRISPR / Cas9 alters the direction of CTCF / cohesin - mediated topological chromatin looping , which consequently leads to the establishment of new chromatin - looping interactions with CBS targets located in neighboring topological domains . DISCUSSION The diverse neuronal cell - surface PCDH repertoires , encoded by more than 50 clustered mammalian Pcdh genes , provide in - dividual neurons with ‘‘identity tags’’ that engage in highly spe - ciﬁc combinatorial homophilic interactions ( Chen and Maniatis , 2013 ; Hirayama et al . , 2012 ; Schreiner and Weiner , 2010 ; Thu et al . , 2014 ; Wu , 2005 ; Wu and Maniatis , 1999 ) . The functional signiﬁcance of these interactions , based on direct evidence and by analogy to the Dscam system of invertebrates , is that they are required for the normal assembly of neural circuits dur - ing brain development ( Chen et al . , 2012 ; Garrett et al . , 2012 ; Lefebvre et al . , 2012 ; Suo et al . , 2012 ; Thu et al . , 2014 ; Wu and Maniatis , 1999 ) . Therefore , understanding how PCDH di - versity is generated in individual neurons is of fundamental importance . The architecture rule of Pcdh CBSs provides interesting in - sights into their insulator functions . Rather than , or in addition to , blocking the cross - domain activities of enhancers as gener - ally thought , the location and relative orientation of CBSs in enhancers determine the direction of looping and therefore indirectly ‘‘insulate’’ one expression domain from another . This perspective may explain seemingly contradictory data previ - ously obtained from reporter gene assays or transgenic mice experiments that addressed whether insulators function in an orientation - dependent manner . The enhancer activity of HS5 - 1 was demonstrated both with reporter genes in transgenic mice ( Ribich et al . , 2006 ) and by targeted deletion ( Kehayova et al . , 2011 ) . The presence of both oriented CBSs ( Guo et al . , 2012 ) and a functional REST / NRSF binding site ( NRSE ) in the HS5 - 1 enhancer regulates the directional looping and neuronal cell - speciﬁc activity of the enhancer ( Guo et al . , 2012 ; Kehayova et al . , 2011 ) . Analysis of HS5 - 1 reporter constructs revealed that the NRSE functions as a silencer in transfection experi - ments , and deletion of the HS5 - 1 enhancer in mice resulted in an increase in Pcdh a gene expression in the kidney ( Kehayova et al . , 2011 ) . The computational analyses presented here re - vealed that 46 % of the potential enhancers genome wide have a nearby CBS ( Figure S4B ) , and 54 % of genome - wide REST / NRSF sites ( Figure S4C ) have a close CBS , suggesting that CTCF functions as an activator or a silencer of transcription by controlling directional looping in different genomic contexts or speciﬁc cell types . Insulators function to ensure proper interactions between remote enhancers and cognate promoters in vivo by blocking enhancers from targeting non - cognate promoters ( Ong and Corces , 2014 ) . Considering that CTCF and cohesin play a pivotal role in the enhancer - blocking activity of insulators , in conjunction with the striking switching of looping directions with in situ CRISPR inversion , as well as biophysical and com - putational analyses , we propose that directional CTCF / cohesin recognition of CBS pairs in the forward - reverse orientations establishes topological domains in mammalian genomes , re - sulting in a boundary element with CBS pairs in the reverse - for - ward orientations between adjacent domains ( Figure 6 ) . In particular , the directional CTCF binding to forward - reverse CBS sites and the asymmetric recruitment of cohesin through the CTCF C - terminal domain ( Xiao et al . , 2011 ) determine A B Figure 5 .

See also Figures S2 and S5 . Cell 162 , 900 – 910 , August 13 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . 907 the looping direction with adjacent CBS sites ( Figure 6 ) . The reverse - forward boundary element between neighboring topo - logical domains functions as an insulator to ensure the proper targeting of cognate promoters by distal enhancers ( inset , Fig - ure 6 ) . This model provides a molecular explanation for the pivotal role of CTCF in organizing chromatin during higher - order chromosome folding and deﬁnes a unifying mechanism for the multivalent and seemingly conﬂicting functions of CTCF in the regulation of gene expression . Interestingly , computational simulation suggests that chromatin loops can ‘‘facilitate’’ or ‘‘insulate’’ enhancer - promoter interactions , depending on their locations outside or inside of the loops ( Doyle et al . , 2014 ) . We note , however , that additional levels of control over directional DNA looping must exist , as the orientations of CBSs alone could not explain the speciﬁcity of DNA looping at such long distances since the chromatin ﬁber is likely to be sufﬁciently ﬂexible to allow the DNA to be positioned to bring enhancers into proper orientation to interact with promoters . Computational analyses reveal that the vast majority of genome - wide chromatin loops occurs between forward - reverse CBSs and a minority of loops occurs between forward - forward or reverse - reverse clusters of CBSs . Together with CRISPR and conformation capture evidence , the genome - wide architec - tural mechanism of CTCF / cohesin - mediated chromosome topology ( Figure 6 ) has important implications not only for long - distance chromatin - looping contacts ranging from several kb to several Mb but also for the enhancer insulation functions of insulators to ensure proper promoter activation by distal en - hancers . We suggest that genome - wide topological chromatin looping can be predicted based on CTCF / cohesin directional binding and its controlling elements can be engineered by CRISPR genome editing . Thus , our ﬁndings reveal how nonlinear 3D genome topology could be encoded by linear 1D genomic sequences . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES CRISPR / Cas9 System The templates for producing target sgRNAs were constructed in pLKO . 1 or pGL3 - U6 - sgRNA - PGK - Puro plasmids ( Li et al . , 2015 ) . All constructs were conﬁrmed by sequencing . To screen for inversion cell clones , cells cultured to about 80 % conﬂuence were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invi - trogen ) in a 6 - well plate with 6 m g of plasmid DNA , including 2 m g of pcDNA3 . 1 - Cas9 and 4 m g of sgRNA constructs ( 2 m g each ) . One day after transfection , puromycin was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 2 m g / ml . Ten to twelve days later , the cells were serially diluted and plated in 96 - well plates to isolate clonal CRISPR cell lines . The primer sets used are shown in Table S7 . Circularized Chromosome Conformation Capture The circularized chromosome conformation capture ( 4C ) - seq libraries were constructed as described ( Guo et al . , 2012 ; Jia et al . , 2014 ) . A series of Figure 6 . A Model of CTCF / Cohesin - Mediated Topological 3D Genome Folding and Gene Regulation In mammalian genomes , CTCF directionally recognizes CBSs by distinct combinations of its 11 ZF domains and asymmetrically recruits the cohesin complex to CBS sites through its C - terminal domain ( Xiao et al . , 2011 ) . CTCF , together with the cohesin complex , establishes speciﬁc long - range chromatin - looping interactions between CBS pairs in the forward - reverse orientations to form distinct topological domains ( domains 1 and 2 , see the upper right inset ) . The weak interactions between the two CBSs in the same forward orientation in topological domain1 may be the consequence of their looping interactions with a common CBS in the reverse orientation ( Guo et al . , 2012 ) . The two CBSs in the reverse - forward orientations form a boundary insulator element between the two neighboring domains 1 and 2 , blocking remote enhancers located within one domain from aberrantly activating promoters located in the neighboring domain and thus ‘‘indirectly’’ ensuring proper activation of cognate promoters by distal enhancers within the same topological domain ( see inset ) . 908 Cell 162 , 900 – 910 , August 13 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . 4C - seq libraries were generated by inverse PCR using a high - ﬁdelity DNA po - lymerase .
