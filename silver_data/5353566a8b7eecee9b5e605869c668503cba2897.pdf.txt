Stephen Waring 3 , Samah W . Al - Jabi 2 and Waleed M . Sweileh 4 Abstract Background : Cocaine is subject to recreational abuse as a stimulant and psychoactive agent , which poses a major worldwide health problem . The aim of the present study was to perform a bibliometric analysis of publication related to cocaine intoxication an insight of the research trends at a global level to enable recommendations for future research strategies in this field . Methods : Publications about cocaine intoxication were retrieved from the Web of Science ( WoS ) Core Collection database on December 28 , 2016 , and analysed regarding the following bibliometric indicators : research trends , document types , languages , countries / territories with their h - index , collaboration patterns , journals with their impact factors ( IF ) , and institutions . Results : In total , 2 , 902 scientific publications from 1975 to 2015 were retrieved from the WoS database . The annual number of publications related to cocaine toxicity increased slightly after 1990 and reached a peak of 148 in 1992 , with an average of 103 publications per year . The USA outranked other countries / territories with 2 , 089 publications , of which 1 , 927 arose exclusively from the USA and 162 involved international collaborations . The h - index for all publications related to cocaine was 212 , and the h - index for all publications related to cocaine intoxication was 99 . Moreover , the USA had the highest h - index of 95 , followed by Spain with h - index of 24 , and Canada with h - index of 24 . The main research topics were consistently reproductive toxicity , clinical management of acute cocaine exposure , laboratory methods for detection of exposure to cocaine , cocaine metabolism , and cocaine toxicity in animals . Conclusions : This is the first bibliometric approach to examining research related to cocaine toxicity and shows that research activity has become more global and extensive since 1990 . The USA remains the leading country regarding published literature , the highest h - index , and greatest role in international collaborations . Keywords : Cocaine , Intoxication , Bibliometric , Web of Science Background Cocaine is subject to recreational abuse as a stimulant and psychoactive agent , and it is commonly presented in its hydrochloride form as a white , water - soluble powder , and may be used orally , intravenously or by nasal insuffla - tion . Relatively pure formulations that lack a hydrochlor - ide moiety are presented in a crystalline form , so - called ‘ freebase ’ or ‘ crack ’ cocaine , which may be used by nasal insufflation , smoking , ingestion or intravenous injection . Pharmaceutical cocaine preparations are available in countries that permit its use for medicinal purposes , namely as a local anaesthetic agent or to assist in man - aging epistaxis [ 1 , 2 ] . Peak circulating cocaine concentrations occur almost immediately after intravenous injection and within sev - eral minutes of smoking , and may be delayed for up to 1 h after nasal insufflation . Cocaine is rapidly eliminated , with a half - life is around one hour and reported duration of acute effects between 2 and 4 h [ 2 ] .

Zyoud et al . Substance Abuse Treatment , Prevention , and Policy ( 2017 ) 12 : 6 DOI 10 . 1186 / s13011 - 017 - 0090 - 9 cocaine may often be considered in two categories : body “ stuffers ” and body “ packers ” . Body stuffers may ingest moderate quantities of cocaine , often loosely packaged and , for example , ingested impulsively to avoid detec - tion . Body packers typically ingest very large quantities of cocaine contained in multiple well wrapped packages for the purposes of drug smuggling . Body stuffers and body packers are at risk of systemic cocaine toxicity , and there may be severe or fatal poisoning due to gastro - intestinal absorption after disruption of packed cocaine wrapping [ 3 – 6 ] . Pharmacological mechanisms of cocaine include block - ade of sodium and potassium channels within the central nervous system , excess sympathetic autonomic outflow , and direct alpha adrenoceptor - mediated vasoconstriction of peripheral blood vessels [ 7 ] . Cocaine increases the risk of thrombotic and non - thrombotic acute coronary syn - drome , stroke and arterial dissection and regular users have more advanced atherosclerosis than age - matched controls ; cardiotoxicity is enhanced in users that co - ingest ethanol due to formation of cocaethylene [ 8 ] . These ad - verse effects include tachycardia , hypertension , chest pain , myocardial infarction , aortic and coronary artery dissec - tion , QT prolongation due to potassium channel blockade , and arrhythmia including ventricular fibrillation [ 9 , 10 ] . Other effects include sweating , fever , rhabdomyolysis , delirium , seizures , intracranial haemorrhage , and sero - tonin syndrome . Powders and other chemicals are often added to in - crease bulk , including lidocaine , benzocaine , levamisole , baking flour , talc and washing powder , and microbial contaminants may also be present [ 11 ] . The observed ef - fects may be caused by cocaine directly , or arise as an adverse effect of cutting agents or other contaminants . For example , agranulocytosis has been attributed to the presence of levamisole [ 12 ] , and methaemoglobinaemia has been caused by local anaesthetic agents [ 13 ] . Clinical management of cocaine intoxication is sup - portive , including administration of benzodiazepines and high doses may be required to reduce agitation , treat sei - zures , and to allow control of tachycardia and high blood pressure . Fluid and electrolyte imbalance should be corrected and serial electrocardiographs and cardiac monitoring to assess for underlying myocardial ischae - mia or dysrhythmia . Standard treatment for suspected cardiac ischaemia or myocardial infarction should be considered , namely antiplatelet agents , calcium channel blockers , nitrates , anticoagulants , and coronary arteriog - raphy [ 14 , 15 ] . Intralipid may be considered for severe , life - threatening cardiac arrhythmia although too few data exist to fully understand its potential role in man - agement of cocaine toxicity [ 16 ] . There has been contro - versy regarding the use of lidocaine due to its sodium channel blocking effects that might be expected to worsen cocaine cardiotoxicity ; however , lidocaine may displace cocaine from cardiac sodium channels and re - duce arrhythmia risk [ 17 ] . Beta - blockers are generally avoided as first line therapy because these will allow un - opposed alpha adrenoceptor - mediated vasoconstriction , and should normally be used with caution after an alpha adrenoceptor blocker has been introduced [ 18 ] . At a global level , recreational cocaine use is at historically high levels [ 19 – 21 ] . Emerging trends demonstrate that co - caine use is having societal and health consequences . Biblio - metric analysis is an efficient tool for examining trends in different scientific fields [ 22 – 26 ] , and defined as the use of statistics and quantitative analysis for research output in the evaluation of research performance . Bibliometric network analysis allows analysis of research collaborations between countries , authors , and institutions [ 27 – 31 ] . Recently , bibliometric techniques have been used to ex - plore trends in research related to various scientific disci - plines ; such as lab - on - a - chip research [ 32 ] , nanotechnology research [ 33 ] , public health research [ 34 ] , organic farming research [ 35 ] , pluripotent stem cell research [ 36 ] , particu - late matter and atherosclerosis research [ 37 ] , and Helico - bacter pylori research [ 38 ] . Earlier research has shown that the same methods may be applied to clinical toxicology themes such as intravenous lipid emulsion as an antidote [ 39 ] , methanol poisoning [ 40 ] , and calcium channel blockers poisoning [ 41 ] . To our knowledge , there has been no bibliometric study of research related to cocaine intoxi - cation . The present study sought to apply established bibliometric techniques to the field of cocaine toxicity , to allow the overall research trends to be examined from a global perspective , and to help build recommendation for future research opportunities . The study was designed to address the following ques - tions : 1 . What is the intellectual structure of the field of research that deals with cocaine intoxication ? 2 . What are the domains or subject clusters that are identified in this field , according to the terms used in publication ti - tles and abstracts ? 3 . What has been the evolution of this field of research over time ? 4 . What are the main re - search topics related to cocaine toxicity , and connections between them ? 5 . What are the networks of researchers identified in the field , according to a co - authorship ana - lysis ? 6 . What are the institutional networks in this field ? 7 . What are the main prolific journals , institutions , countries in this field ? and , 8 . Which publications have the highest impact on this field ? Methods Data about cocaine intoxication were retrieved from the Web of Science ( WoS ) Core Collection Database on December 28 , 2016 . This database is considered one of the most complete and reliable databases for bibliomet - ric analyses , and covers over 12 , 000 of the highest Zyoud et al . Substance Abuse Treatment , Prevention , and Policy ( 2017 ) 12 : 6 Page 2 of 15 impact , quality scientific international journals [ 42 – 46 ] . To identify research related to cocaine intoxication , we took the following steps in conducting this study : Step 1 : Publications with “ cocaine ” as keywords in the title were downloaded . To achieve better accuracy in the results , the search was restricted to the Title field in the WoS database over all the previous year ’ s up to December 31 , 2015 because if expanded to other search fields such as Abstract or Keywords , many publications obtained were not relevant to cocaine ( i . e false - positive data ) . We applied a title - only search instead of a topic search ( title , abstract , and keyword ) accepting a small loss of sensitivity but significantly increasing specificity [ 35 , 47 ] . Year 2016 was excluded as this year still open for new issues . Furthermore , data proposed to be incomplete due to reasons such as the time - lag between publications and indexing in WoS database . In this step it was promising to get all publications in the field of cocaine intoxication that were published in the period comprised between 1975 and 2015 . Step 2 : We limited our retrieved publications in the field of cocaine intoxication to all those indexed under the research category ‘ Toxicology ” in WoS database . Step 3 : To include all the documents about cocaine intoxication that are published in journals or conference proceedings indexed in other subject categories , we used the following search strategy : term cocaine in the title ; using the truncated terms * toxic * OR poison * OR overdos * as a search phrases to search topic in the WoS database over all the earlier years up to December 31 , 2015 . The search equation used produces publications that are relevant by truncating some terms , such as “ poison * ” , which leads to the recovery of publications on poison , poisoning , or poisonous . Furthermore , in this step , we excluded documents published in the category “ Toxicology ” . Step 4 : In this step , search equations from step 1 , 2 and 3 were combined in one search query and the results were analyzed and presented . Search query used for data extraction from WoS looked like this : ( TI = ( cocaine ) AND TS = ( * toxic * OR poison * OR overdos * ) ) OR ( TI = ( cocaine ) AND SU = ( Toxicology ) ) ; ( See Additional file 1 ) . Step 5 : The retrieved publications were analysed regarding the following bibliometric indicators as done in previous bibliometric studies [ 27 – 31 ] : research trends , document types , languages , countries / territories with their h - index , collaboration patterns , journals with their impact factors ( IF ) , and institutions . Our study relied on the connection between countries , topics , authors , and institutions using visualizations and clustering algorithms to locate the main groups among them by VOSviewer software [ 27 , 48 – 50 ] . The VOSviewer v . 1 . 6 . 5 was used for viewing and constructing the desired bibliometric maps [ 48 ] . VOSviewer was employed to illustrate the co - occurrence network of high - frequency terms related to cocaine toxicity to detect how research topics related to cocaine changed and progressed through time . The timespan of 1975 – 2015 was selected , and it was split into three periods : 1975 – 1995 ; 1996 – 2005 , and 2006 – 2015 . The size of circles in VOSviewer maps represents the number of publications related to certain term , and the distance between two terms gives an implication of the number of co - occurrences of the terms . Furthermore , terms close to each other or having certain color are more probable dealing with the same topic . Statistical analysis All the retrieved results were imported into Excel 2007 for further analysis , and data presented as frequencies and percentages of publications . The ten most product - ive countries and journals in the field of cocaine toxicity were identified . The journal IF was obtained from the Journal Citation Report ( JCR ) Science Edition 2015 . The h - index was calculated as the number of publications ( n ) that have achieved at least n citations . Publications ori - ginating from England , Northern Ireland , Scotland , and Wales were merged as being from the United Kingdom ( UK ) . Pearson correlation test was used to examine the correlations between all cocaine publication productivity and that related to specifically to cocaine toxicity . A sig - nificance level of P < 0 . 05 was considered to be statisti - cally significant . SPSS ® version 16 was used to perform the statistical analysis . Fig . 1 Evolution of scientific research in the field of cocaine toxicity Zyoud et al . Substance Abuse Treatment , Prevention , and Policy ( 2017 ) 12 : 6 Page 3 of 15 Results From 1975 to 2015 , there were 21 , 683 publications on cocaine , including 2 , 902 scientific publications related to cocaine intoxication ( See Additional file 1 ) . Out of the 2 , 902 publications in the field of cocaine toxicity that were analysed in this study , 2 , 823 ( 97 . 3 % ) were pub - lished in English , followed by Spanish ( 36 ; 1 . 2 % ) , French ( 29 ; 1 . 0 % ) and German ( 12 ; 0 . 4 % ) . Original articles ( 2 , 205 ) were the most frequent publication type ( 76 . 0 % ) , followed by meeting abstracts ( 323 ; 11 . 1 % ) , proceedings papers ( 145 , 5 . 0 % ) , reviews ( 142 ; 4 . 9 % ) , and letters ( 108 ; 3 . 7 % ) . Annual publications on cocaine toxicity are sum - marised in Fig . 1 . The annual number of publications re - lated to cocaine toxicity increased slightly after 1990 and reached a peak of 148 publications in 1992 , and then the total output has fluctuated with an average of 103 publi - cations per year . Publication of articles related to cocaine in all fields has increased considerably after 1986 with a peak of 825 in 1996 , and a subsequent average of 746 publications per year .

Figure 7 shows the co - occurrence network of high - frequency terms in the title or / and abstract of retrieved publications related to cocaine toxicity during 1975 – 2015 which reflect most frequently encountered topics in this field . The five most used topics in cocaine toxicity are represented by five coloured clusters : blue , yellow , green , purple and red colors . Cluster number 1 ( yellow color ) included terms related to reproductive toxicity topic such as “ prenatal cocaine exposure ” , “ infant ” , or “ mother ” ; Cluster number 2 ( green color ) included terms related to cocaine exposure and clinical management topic such as “ patient ” , “ case ” , or “ hospital ” ; Cluster number 3 ( purple color ) included terms related to laboratory methods for detection of exposure to cocaine topic such as “ mass spectrometry ” , “ metabolite ” , or “ detec - tion ” ; Cluster number 4 ( blue color ) included terms re - lated to cocaine metabolism topic such as “ enzyme ” , “ inducer ” , or “ metabolism ” ; and Cluster number 5 ( red color ) included terms related to cocaine toxicity in animal models topic such as “ rat ” , “ mice ” . Additional file 2 : Figure S1 – S4 shows the density maps for co - occurrence of terms used in the title and abstract of retrieved publications across different time periods , from low density ( blue ) to high density ( red ) . The three most cited publications in cocaine toxicity are shown for each of the top ten productive countries ( Table 3 ) [ 51 – 80 ] . From 1975 to 2015 , the most fre - quently cited article was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Ramamoorthy et al [ 55 ] in 1993 and had been cited 657 times . Table 4 lists the top three most productive institutions from or collaborating with the top ten most productive coun - tries in the field of cocaine toxicity . Leading was the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) with 115 publications , followed by University of Miami with 65 publications . Figure 8 demonstrates the collaboration network of top - 155 institutes publishing more than five documents during 1975 – 2015 . The size of circles represents the number of publications of the institute and the thickness of lines signifies the size of collaboration . As shown in Fig . 8 , National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) , University of Miami , and Tufts University have the most collaboration with other USA or worldwide institutes . Discussion The number of publications in the field of cocaine in - toxication has grown during the studied 40 years , and correlates with growth in publications in all fields related to cocaine . There was a steady growth rate until 1992 , then total output has been fairly stable with some fluctu - ations between 1992 and 2015 . The increased number of publications may be due to : 1 . the number of frequent Table 4 Top three most productive institutions from or collaborating with the top ten most productive countries in the field of cocaine toxicity SCR Institute n ( % ) USA ( number of documents = 2 , 089 ) 1 st National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) 115 ( 5 . 51 ) 2 nd University of Miami 65 ( 3 . 11 ) 3 rd Yale University 55 ( 2 . 63 ) Italy ( number of documents = 100 ) 1 st UniversitàCattolica del Sacro Cuore 12 ( 12 . 00 ) 2 nd IstitutoSuperiore di Sanità 9 ( 9 . 00 ) 3 rd Sapienza – Università di Roma 8 ( 8 . 00 ) France ( number of documents = 90 ) 1 st HôpitalFernand - Widal 15 ( 16 . 67 ) 2 nd Institut national de la santé et de la recherchemédicale - INSERM 9 ( 10 . 00 ) 3 rd Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons 7 ( 7 . 78 ) Brazil ( number of documents = 55 ) 1 st University of São Paulo 22 ( 40 . 00 ) 2 nd Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais 6 ( 10 . 91 ) 3 rd Universidade Federal de São Paulo 6 ( 10 . 91 ) Japan ( number of documents = 42 ) 1 st Kyoto University 9 ( 21 . 43 ) 2 nd Showa University 6 ( 14 . 29 ) 3 rd National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) 4 ( 9 . 52 ) Spain ( number of documents = 145 ) 1 st University of Santiago de Compostela 15 ( 10 . 35 ) 2 nd Autonomous University of Barcelona 11 ( 7 . 59 ) 3 rd University of Valencia 9 ( 6 . 21 ) Canada ( number of documents = 92 ) 1 st University of Toronto 28 ( 30 . 44 ) 2 nd The Hospital for Sick Children 24 ( 26 . 09 ) 3 rd University of British Columbia 8 ( 8 . 70 ) UK ( number of documents = 80 ) 1 st University of Cambridge 18 ( 22 . 50 ) 2 nd Guy ’ s and St Thomas ’ NHS Foundation Trust 6 ( 7 . 50 ) 3 rd Guy ’ s Hospital 4 ( 5 . 00 ) Germany ( number of documents = 50 ) 1 st Goethe University Frankfurt 4 ( 8 . 00 ) 2 nd Maastricht University 4 ( 8 . 00 ) 3 rd Universität Heidelberg 4 ( 8 . 00 ) Switzerland ( number of documents = 31 ) 1 st University of Zurich 12 ( 38 . 71 ) 2 nd Swiss Federal Institute of Technology 10 ( 32 . 26 ) 3 rd Université de Fribourg 2 ( 6 . 45 ) n Number of documents ( % ) , SCR Standard competition ranking Zyoud et al . Substance Abuse Treatment , Prevention , and Policy ( 2017 ) 12 : 6 Page 11 of 15 cocaine users has been increasing since 1980 [ 81 ] , 2 . greater awareness of concerns about life - threatening conse - quences of cocaine toxicity , particularly related to cardiac , cerebrovascular , and maternal morbidity and mortality [ 2 , 82 , 83 ] , 3 . increasing cocaine use at a global level [ 84 ] , and , 4 . new pharmacological concepts related to cocaine use , namely in its role as a local anaesthetic agent [ 81 , 85 ] . The USA is the most productive country in research related to cocaine intoxication , which is similar to pat - terns identified for other clinical toxicology research , such as intravenous lipid emulsion as an antidote [ 39 ] , paracetamol poisoning [ 86 , 87 ] , acetylcysteine as anti - dote [ 88 ] , methanol poisoning [ 40 ] , and calcium channel blockers poisoning [ 41 ] . Possible reasons include the comparatively large research budgets , and rapid eco - nomic growth [ 89 ] . In addition , it was reported that co - caine was the most commonly abused drug in parts of the USA [ 1 , 19 ] . Another noticeable finding was that all the top cited publications in the field of cocaine intoxi - cation originated from the USA . These results are con - sistent with data obtained by previous bibliometric studies that a few developed countries such as the USA generate the most frequently cited toxicology studies [ 39 , 41 , 87 , 90 ] . This might be influenced by factors such as access to publications by scholars from the USA . There may be greater opportunities for USA researchers to access databases and attend international conferences and academic exchange programs , that contribute to higher citation rates [ 91 ] . A possible explanation is the generalised trend towards increasing publication numbers across a range of scientific fields within the USA . Further - more , there are some indications that the USA researchers tend to cite publications from their own country [ 92 ] . The percentages of all publications appearing in the top journals were comparatively low , indicating a spread of publications allocated to generalised and specialised journals , and reflecting the broad range of research in - terests related to cocaine . This is similar to several other areas of toxicology research with a high level of multi - disciplinary interest , including intravenous lipid emul - sion as an antidote [ 39 ] , methanol poisoning [ 40 ] , and calcium channel blockers poisoning [ 41 ] . The most frequently cited and highly influential publi - cation was related to a novel hypothesis of cocaine pharmacological action , namely “ Antidepressant - and cocaine - sensitive human serotonin transporter : molecular cloning , expression , and chromosomal localization ” . Under - standing the citation patterns is important in evaluating an individual publication , and may also help understand how a certain topics or concepts are disseminated within the scientific community [ 93 ] . Bibliometric analysis has a limitations , including database variations , discipline variation , and bias towards English language [ 26 , 94 ] . As with all previous bibliometric studies [ 94 – 96 ] , our study is limited by use of search term “ co - caine ” to only the title search . Specially , any publications Fig . 8 Institutional collaboration networks in cocaine toxicity during 1975 – 2015 . Of the 1 , 533 institutes , 171 had at least five relevant publications . The largest set of connected institutes consists of 155 institutes in 18 clusters Zyoud et al . Substance Abuse Treatment , Prevention , and Policy ( 2017 ) 12 : 6 Page 12 of 15 that used “ cocaine ” as a key word in the publication may have been missed in our analysis . It is widely known that the total number of publications from major databases such as Google Scholar , Scopus , PubMed , and WoS differs . Fur - thermore , there is an indisputable inclination that English is the language of science , and certain databases may omit publications in different languages . Conclusions Research progress related to cocaine intoxication has been assessed for the first time based on a bibliometric approach . Research related to cocaine intoxication has become more global and extensive after 1990 , and the USA is the leading country with the greatest number of publications and highest h - index . The main topics have consistently been reproductive toxicity , cocaine exposure and clinical management , laboratory methods for detec - tion of exposure to cocaine , cocaine metabolism , and co - caine toxicity in animals . These findings may provide a valuable basis for identifying important topics for future research , and create opportunities for collaboration be - tween research groups with complementary scientific interest in the field of cocaine toxicity .
