Here we show that in budding yeast , actin ﬁlament depolymeriza - tion plays a major role in actomyosin ring constric - tion . Coﬁlin mutation or chemically stabilizing actin ﬁlaments attenuate actomyosin ring constriction . Deletion of myosin II motor domain or the myosin regulatory light chain reduced the contraction rate and also the rate of actin depolymerization in the ring . We constructed a quantitative microscopic model of actomyosin ring constriction via ﬁlament sliding driven by both actin depolymerization and myosin II motor activity . Model simulations based on experimental measurements support the notion that actin depolymerization is the predominant mechanism for ring constriction . The model predicts invariability of total contraction time regardless of the initial ring size , as originally reported for C . elegans embryonic cells . This prediction was validated in yeast cells of different sizes due to different ploidies . INTRODUCTION The actomyosin ring is a transient structure built with a network of actin ﬁlaments and myosin II motor proteins required for the generation of force for cytokinesis in animal cells and yeast . The actomyosin ring is assembled during speciﬁc phases of mitosis and is precisely positioned to bisect the elongating anaphase spindle such that sister chromosomes are segregated to opposing sides of the cleavage plane ( Balasubramanian et al . , 2004 ; Barr and Gruneberg , 2007 ; Field et al . , 1999 ; Pollard , 2010 ) . Cell - cycle kinases activated at mitotic exit signal the initi - ation of actomyosin ring constriction to drive furrow ingression ( Glotzer , 2001 ; McCollum and Gould , 2001 ; Pollard , 2010 ; Wolfe and Gould , 2005 ; Wolfe et al . , 2009 ; Yoshida et al . , 2006 ) . The actomyosin ring disassembles promptly on the completion of furrow closure . Cytokinesis is a key process in development and growth , and impairment of cytokinesis leads to genome instability ( Li , 2007 ; Normand and King , 2010 ; Storchova and Pellman , 2004 ) . Considerable progress has been made in recent years to understand the regulatory processes and cytoskeletal components required for actomyosin ring assembly and function ( Pollard , 2010 ) . However , the basic mechanism of force generation orchestrated by actin ﬁlaments and myosin II has remained elusive . Inferred from actomyosin force production in striated muscle , it was originally proposed that contractile stress in the actomy - osin ring is generated via a ‘‘sliding ﬁlament’’ mechanism , in which bipolar myosin motor ﬁlaments walk along actin ﬁlaments within organized sarcomere - like arrays ( Schroeder , 1975 ) . However , both classical and recent studies have noted impor - tant distinctions between cytokinetic structures and muscle sarcomeres . Electron microscopy studies in cultured mamma - lian cells and ﬁssion yeast showed that actin ﬁlaments are more isotropically oriented with respect to each other than forming strictly antiparallel arrays ( Kamasaki et al . , 2007 ; Mabu - chi et al . , 1988 ; Maupin and Pollard , 1986 ; Sanger and Sanger , 1980 ; Schroeder , 1973 ) . Furthermore , unlike sarcomeric actomyosin structures , which conserve in mass during cycles of contraction and relaxation , it has been widely observed that actomyosin ring reduces in mass , often manifested as the roughly constant ring width and actin and myosin density as the ring shortens in circumference ( Carvalho et al . , 2009 ; Schroeder , 1972 ; Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) . Consistent with the constant width and density , previous studies reported a constant contraction speed during cleavage furrow ingression ( Carvalho et al . , 2009 ; Zumdieck et al . , 2007 ) . Although myosin motor activity is required for cytokinesis in many experimental models , several examples are known where myosin II or myosin II motor activity is not strictly required for cytokinesis ( Fang et al . , 2010 ; Gerisch and Weber , 2000 ; Lord et al . , 2005 ) . Particularly relevant to this study , cytokinesis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae involves a ring structure composed of actin ﬁlaments and myosin II ( Myo1 ) , and indeed , in euploid strains of both the S288c and W303a backgrounds ( two commonly studied genetic backgrounds ) , myosin II is essential for cell division ( Rancati et al . , 2008 ; Tolliday et al . , 2003 ) . Although Myo1 is required for actin assembly in Developmental Cell 22 , 1247 – 1260 , June 12 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 1247 the ring ( Bi et al . , 1998 ) , surprisingly , the motor domain of Myo1 is not required for ring constriction or cytokinesis ( Fang et al . , 2010 ; Lord et al . , 2005 ) . Myosin II - independent cytokinesis has also been well documented in myosin II - deleted Dictyostelium discoideum cells ( De Lozanne and Spudich , 1987 ; Knecht and Loomis , 1987 ; Neujahr et al . , 1997 ; Zang et al . , 1997 ) . In this system actin ﬁlaments and cortexillin , an actin crosslinker , are thought to be important in addition to contributions from microtubules and relaxation of the polar cortex ( Simson et al . , 1998 ; Stock et al . , 1999 ; Weber et al . , 1999 ) . Considering the differences between species in the extent by which myosin II is required for cytokinesis , it is unclear whether a common framework can be found to explain the basic force generation mechanism in the actomyosin ring . A possible conceptual breakthrough is the consideration that , in addition to motor action , ﬁlament dynamics in actin bundles may have the ability to generate contractile stress . A recent theoretical paper by Zumdieck et al . ( 2007 ) proposed a macro - scopic model combining material exchange with force balance . This model was able to recapitulate the observation of roughly constant contraction speed and constant ﬁlament density observed in dividing C . elegans embryos . The authors also proposed microscopic concepts where parallel or antiparallel actin ﬁlament conﬁgurations could generate force through either myosin II motor or actin depolymerization in the presence of end - tracking crosslinkers . However , it remained to be tested if actin ﬁlament dynamics are indeed crucial for cytokinesis and how such mechanism may be integrated with myosin II motor activity . In this study , we build upon the work of Zumdieck et al . ( 2007 ) to propose a quantitative microscopic model accounting for both motor action and ﬁlament dynamics to explain the ob - served properties of the actomyosin ring during budding yeast cytokinesis . We demonstrate , using a combination of model and experimental analyses , that the primary contractile force during budding yeast cytokinesis results from actin depolymer - ization mediated by coﬁlin and myosin II motor activity . Our model also predicts the independence of the contraction time on the initial size of the contractile ring , a phenomenon recently reported in the developing C . elegans embryos ( Carvalho et al . , 2009 ) . RESULTS Protein Dynamics and Material Balance during Actomyosin Ring Constriction We measured the rates describing actin dynamics and ring constriction during cytokinesis ﬁrst in the wild - type ( WT ) S288c budding yeast cells . To visualize actin ﬁlaments in the contractile ring and due to the inability to directly tag ﬁlamentous actin ( Doyle and Botstein , 1996 ) , we utilized a probe ( iqgCH - GFP ) , which contains a fragment of Iqg1 / Cyk1 ( aa 1 – 446 ) , harboring the actin - binding calponin homology ( CH ) domain and tagged at the COOH terminus with green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) . The homologous region of Rng2 in ﬁssion yeast speciﬁcally labels actin ﬁlaments in the actomyosin ring , but not other actin structures ( Takaine et al . , 2009 ) . We conﬁrmed that the iqgCH - GFP also speciﬁcally labels contractile ring actin in an F - actin - dependent manner ( Figure 1A ; see Figure S1C avail - able online ) . To observe Myo1 dynamics , a GFP tag was introduced to the 3 0 end of the MYO1 ORF at the genomic locus ( Fang et al . , 2010 ; Lister et al . , 2006 ) ( Figure 1B ) . Contraction speed observed with these probes was consistent with those previously observed in WT cells ( Fang et al . , 2010 ; Lippincott and Li , 1998a ; Lister et al . , 2006 ; Lord et al . , 2005 ) . Actin and Myo1 ring constricted at a roughly constant speed ( Figure 2A ; Movies S1A and S1B ) . We measured the average ﬂuorescence intensity of iqgCH - GFP or Myo1 - GFP in the ring , which reports the relative density of actin ﬁlaments or myosin II density , respectively , during ring constriction . The average intensity of the actin probe moderately decreased as the ring constricted , whereas Myo1 density remained roughly constant as previously shown by Lippincott and Li ( 1998a ) ( Figures 1 and 2A ) . The apparent decline in actin density was not due to photobleaching because it occurred only during contraction , and our method of intensity measurement accounts for photo - bleaching ( see Experimental Procedures ) . To compute in vivo parameters of actin dynamics from the aforementioned microscopy recording , we started with the material balance equation of Zumdieck et al . ( 2007 ) : dc dt = k p (cid:2) k d c (cid:2) 1 D dD dt c ; ( 1 ) where k p and k d are the rates of actin polymerization and depolymerization , respectively , and D denotes the ring diameter . The last term on the right describes the change in actin density ( c ) due to contraction in the absence of ﬁlament polymer - ization and depolymerization . Neglecting ﬁlament polymeriza - tion ( k p = 0 ) during contraction ( see below for justiﬁcation of this assumption ) , we arrive at the equation 1 c dc dt = (cid:2) k d (cid:2) 1 D dD dt ; ( 2 ) where all terms in the equation have a dimension of inverse time ( s (cid:2) 1 ) . Introducing the normalized rate of contraction a = (cid:2) 1 = D $ ð dD = dt Þ and the normalized rate of density loss b = (cid:2) 1 = c $ ð dc = dt Þ into Equation 2 , we obtained k d = a + b : ( 3 ) We note that the relation in Equation 3 is valid only for normal - ized rates that have the same dimension of s (cid:2) 1 . The simple relationship of Equation 3 was used for obtaining actin - depoly - merization rate from the experimental estimates of a and b ( see Experimental Procedures ) . Equation 3 also implies that depolymerization contributes to both actin density loss and ring contraction in some proportion , as further explored below . Effect of Myosin II Motor Inactivation on Ring Constriction and Actin Depolymerization We next performed measurements to quantify the role of myosin II motor in actomyosin dynamics during cytokinesis . We gener - ated a yeast strain expressing GFP - tagged Myo1 lacking the motor domain ( Myo1 D m - GFP ) at the native MYO1 locus . Consistent with the previous ﬁnding , the motorless construct rescued the cytokinesis defect of D myo1 ( Fang et al . , 2010 ) , whereas the strain remained euploid ( data not shown ) . However , the contraction rate a was signiﬁcantly reduced ( by 40 % ) Developmental Cell Actin Depolymerization Drives Ring Contraction 1248 Developmental Cell 22 , 1247 – 1260 , June 12 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . compared to the WT rate , and the actin density loss rate was also slightly reduced ( Figure 2B ; Movies S2E and S2F ; Table 1 ) . k d estimate based on Equation 3 found myo1 D m to reduce the actin - depolymerization rate by 42 % . Mlc2 is the regulatory light chain for the yeast myosin II expected to be important for Myo1 motor activity ( Luo et al . , 2004 ) . We tested if D mlc2 exhibited a similar effect . Indeed , D mlc2 also signiﬁcantly reduced the contraction rate and the rate of actin depolymeriza - tion ( Figures 1 and 2B ; Movies S2C and S2D ; Table 1 ) . However , unlike the case in ﬁssion yeast ( see YFP - MYO2 experiments in Stark et al . , 2010 ) , an extra copy of MYO1 - GFP in budding yeast merely broadened the ring along the bud - mother axis without any increase in Myo1 concentration or alteration of ring contrac - tion dynamics ( data not shown ) . The aforementioned results nonetheless suggest that yeast myosin II motor activity is important for actomyosin ring constriction and actin depolymer - ization during the constriction process . Evidence that Actin Depolymerization Is Important for Actomyosin Ring Constriction To evaluate the role for actin depolymerization in cytokinesis , we tested the effect of blocking actin depolymerization by the actin - stabilizing drug , jasplakinolide ( Ayscough , 2000 ; Ayscough et al . , 1997 ; Bubb et al . , 1994 , 2000 ; Cramer , 1999 ; Lee et al . , 1998 ) , on actomyosin ring constriction . First , a titration experi - ment was performed to determine a concentration of jasplakino - lide sufﬁcient to cause a considerable reduction in the rate of actin disassembly in yeast cells without inducing gross disorga - nization of actin structures ( Figure S1D ; Movie S3B ) .

The jasplakinolide treatment led to a signiﬁcant decrease ( 26 % ) in the contraction rate compared to DMSO - treated cells ( Figures 3A , 4A , and 4B ; Movie S3 ; Table 1 ) . Interestingly , the drug had a minimal and insigniﬁcant effect on actin density change in the contractile ring compared to the DMSO - treated control ( Figure 4C ) , suggesting that the actin depolymerization blocked by jasplaki - nolide ( by 21 % compared to DMSO control ) was quantitatively correlated with the slowdown of ring constriction . To further investigate the role of actin depolymerization in ring constriction , we tested the effects of a mutation in COF1 , encoding coﬁlin , the main actin - depolymerizing factor in yeast ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Moon et al . , 1993 ) . cof1 - 22 was previously shown to impair the actin - depolymerization activity of Cof1 in vivo and in vitro ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ) . cof1 - 22 cells are able to assemble a morphologically normal actomyosin ring . Consistent with the effect of jasplakinolide , the rate of ring constriction was signiﬁcantly reduced , whereas the rate of actin density change in the ring was not signiﬁcantly altered ( Figures 1 and 2B ; Movie S1 ; Table 1 ) . Based on Equation 3 , cof1 - 22 reduced actin - depoly - merization rate by 25 % compared to the WT rate , consistent with the moderate effect of the mutant protein on actin depoly - merization observed in vitro ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ) . However , this reduction of actin - depolymerization rate was accompanied with a similar level of reduction ( by 22 % ) in ring constriction rate ( Figure 2B ; Table 1 ) , suggesting that the coﬁlin - mediated actin depolymerization largely contributed to actomy - osin ring constriction . We then treated cof1 - 22 mutant cells with 100 m M jasplakinolide ( to combine the effects of both methods for blocking actin depolymerization ) . Under this condition , in 6 of the 35 cells imaged , actomyosin ring contraction was completely blocked , whereas in the remaining 29 the ring contracted with a drastically reduced rate ( by 65 % compared to WT DMSO control ) ( Figures 3C and 4 ; Table 1 ; Movie S5 ) . These results strongly suggest that actin depolymerization plays a critical role in actomyosin ring contraction . wt ( n = 38 ) cof1 - 22 Δ mlc2 myo1 m α ( 10 − 3 x s - 1 ) 0 50 100 150 200 250 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 Time ( s ) Myo1 ( n = 26 ) ( n = 30 ) ( n = 13 ) wt cof1 - 22 Δ mlc2 myo1 m ( n = 38 ) ( n = 26 ) ( n = 30 ) ( n = 13 ) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) - 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) p = 0 . 0001 1 2 3 4 5 Protein density Ring diameter N o r m . v a l ue s N o r m . v a l ue s β ( 10 − 3 x s - 1 ) 0 50 100 150 200 250 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 Protein density Ring diameter Actin Time ( s ) p = 2x10 - 8 p = 7x10 - 9 p = 0 . 04 p = 0 . 19 p = 0 . 02 A B Figure 2 .

See also Figures S1A and S1B . The Synergy between Motor Action and Actin Depolymerization in Ring Constriction The results above revealed two molecular functions contributing to actomyosin ring contraction in budding yeast : one relying on actin depolymerization , the other requiring the myosin II motor . These func - tions are not independent because the latter also affects actin depolymerization during constriction . To examine the synergy betweendepolymerization andmotoraction , wetestedtheeffect of 100 m M jasplakinolide on the constriction of Myo1 D m ring . In 16 out of 32 cells examined , jasplakinolide completely blocked Myo1 D m ring contraction ( Figure 3B ; Movie S4C ) , and in the remaining 16 the contraction rate as well as the actin - depolymer - izationratewereseverelyreduced ( Figures3Band4 ; MoviesS4A andS4B ; Table1 ) . Notethatinallthecellsimaged , intheabsence or presence of the very slow contraction , no buildup of actin density was observed . Treatment of these cells with LatA did not lead to reduced actin density in the ring ( Figure S1E ) , suggesting that the stable actin density was not due to balanced polymerization and depolymerization . This observation supports the assumption that actin polymerization was negligible during the time of ring constriction . Consistent with this assumption for actin , FRAP experiment suggests that Myo1 does not undergo turnover during the constriction phase ( Figure S1F ) . A Quantitative Model of Actomyosin Ring Contraction To build a mechanistic framework explaining the experimental observations described above and to allow quantitative predic - tions of actomyosin ring behavior in the cell , we constructed a bottom - up model for ring contraction starting from a set of microscopic elements and their interactions and computation - ally predicted macroscopic variables such as the rates of contraction and actin density loss in the actomyosin ring . The microscopic elements and our basic assumptions of their inter - actions are as follows : ( 1 ) The contractile ring is made up of actin ﬁlaments , bipolar myosin II motors , actin - depolymerizing protein coﬁlin , and an actin crosslinker with the possibility to maintain association with shortening ﬁlament ends ( Figures 5A and S2A ) . ( 2 ) Based on the classical assumption of myosin II motor function , Myo1 can slide an actin ﬁlament relative to Developmental Cell Actin Depolymerization Drives Ring Contraction 1250 Developmental Cell 22 , 1247 – 1260 , June 12 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . the other in a given ﬁlament pair at a single motor rate of v ( in unit of s (cid:2) 1 ) . ( 3 ) A second type of actin sliding can be induced by actin depolymerization , preferentially at or near the pointed end , combined with an actin crosslinker ( Zumdieck et al . , 2007 ) ( Figure 5A ) . We introduce the rate k ( in unit of s (cid:2) 1 ) for ﬁlament sliding caused by actin depolymeriza - tion , and parameter g , representing the average fraction of time by which a crosslinker is in position to reattach to the new ﬁlament end after a depolymerization event , such as a cut by coﬁlin ( Figure 5A , left column ) . Thus , g is essentially the frequency of productive crosslinking to allow depolymerization to cause ﬁlament sliding ( Figure 5A ) . ( 4 ) The rate of the motor v is expected to be lower than the rate of depolymerization k because otherwise there would be a general buildup of density in the ring during contrac - tion , which was not normally observed ( Figure 1B ) . We further estimate v to be roughly k / 4 ( Supplemental Exper - imental Procedures , where we also discuss the estimates for v and g ) . ( 5 ) For pairs of ﬁlaments we consider all possible conﬁgura - tions in regard to ﬁlament orientations and positions of the motor and crosslinker . The formula for the combined rate of sliding of one ﬁlament ( the lower one in each entry of Figure S2A ) with respect to the other ( upper ) is provided for each case ( Figure S2A ) . Examples are also shown in Figure 5C . Having speciﬁed the structural components , we consider a relatively simple contractile ring represented by a one - dimensional chain of the number ( n ) of actin ﬁlaments arranged in a ring ( Figure 5B ; Movie S6 ) . The initial mean size of each ﬁlament is L 0 with the SD d L ; the mean size of the overlapping region of the adjacent ﬁlaments is S 0 with the SD d S . Addition of each ﬁlament in the computation construction of the ring in general leads to lengthening of the structure . The initial orientations of the ﬁlaments are generated by a random process controlled by a clustering coefﬁcient z describing ﬁlament clustering ( grouping of parallel ﬁlaments , Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) . The extreme values of z are + 1 and (cid:2) 1 and correspond to ordered ring structures , namely , all parallel ﬁlaments and ﬁlaments with alternating orientations , respectively . The values of z far from these extremes correspond to random ﬁlament orientations . A key simpliﬁcation making the computation feasible is that the i th ﬁlament interacts only with two adjacent ( i (cid:2) 1 ) th and ( i + 1 ) th ﬁlaments . After a given time step , we compute ﬁlament positions as a result of sliding based on the formulas described in Figure S2A for any given ﬁlament conﬁguration . Thus , Figure S2A was essentially used as a lookup table for each step of the com - putation ( see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for additional details ) . Consider several examples of the displacement rate com - putation using Figure S2A . The simplest structure is shown as the ﬁrst example in Figure 5C ( top pair ) . The relative ﬁlament positions do not allow any activity of the crosslinkers at the pointed end ( tail of the arrows in the illustration ) , so that only the myosin motor activity can cause the lower ﬁlament to move to the right ( positive direction ) with the speed equal to 2 v . A more complex conﬁguration is shown as the structure corresponding to the middle example in Figure 5C , where a myosin motor and a single crosslinker slide the lower ﬁlament in same direction relative to the top ﬁlament . During the time step D t , the crosslinker is active for g D t with the rate k , whereas the myosin motor contributes to the displacement for ( 1 (cid:2) g ) D t with the speed v that leads to a shift of the lower ﬁlament to the left with the rate g k + ( 1 (cid:2) g ) v . An even more complex case is the bottom example in Figure 5C showing two crosslinkers competing with a myosin motor . The probability of one cross - linker to be inactive is ( 1 (cid:2) g ) ; assuming that they are working independently , we ﬁnd total probability of both crosslinkers to be inactive as ( 1 (cid:2) g ) 2 and thus the motor - driven displacement rate equal to ( 1 (cid:2) g ) 2 v . The contribution of the crosslinkers can be found given that at least one of them is active 1 (cid:2) ( 1 (cid:2) g ) 2 = ( 2 g (cid:2) g 2 ) fraction of time , leading to a rate of ( 2 g (cid:2) g 2 ) k .

At the end of each time step of a simulation , the length of each ﬁlament , the size of the entire ﬁlament structure , and the current value of the actin density in the contracting ring were computed . This procedure was repeated until a certain minimal size of the ring was reached . The resulting data allowed us to compute the normalized rate of contraction a by ﬁtting the data to the linear function L ( 1 (cid:2) a t ) , where L denotes the initial size of the ﬁla - ment structure . Similarly , the normalized actin density loss rate b was found by ﬁtting of the computed actin density changes to the function C ( 1 (cid:2) b t ) , where C is the initial actin density in the ring , which can be estimated as C (cid:3) L 0 / ( L 0 (cid:2) S 0 ) . A real contractile ring can be considered as being composed of many simple contractile rings as modeled above , linked laterally with one another . Thus , the real contraction and density loss rates would be equal to the average rate of contraction for a number of such structures , built and contracting with the same parameters . To search for reasonable parameter values of g and z , we used the experimental data ( Table 1 ) for two characteristic cases , WT and Myo1 motor deletion , to compute all possible values of g and z that produce a a / b ratio in the range of 2 . 0 – 4 . 0 as observed . The overlap of the parameter spaces from these two cases gave possible values of g and z ( Figure 5D ) . g is in the range of 0 . 25 – 0 . 35 that is similar to the estimate given in Supplemental D M S O 100 μ M J a s p l .

Box plots are as described in Figure 2B . constant contraction speed , consistent with the experimental observation ( compare Figure 5E ) . The predicted values of a and b , which were nondimen - sional , when scaled with the contraction rate a observed for WT cells , were remarkably consistent with the experi - mentally measured ones under all condi - tions ( Figures 5F and 5G ; Table 1 ) . The consistency between measured versus predicted a and b values was also observed when g and z pairs near the edges of the allowable parameter space were used ( Figure S2B ) . It is important to note that our model rules allow both local contraction and expansion on the level of individual ﬁlament pairs ( Figure 6 ) . The overall contraction ( a > 0 ) or expansion ( a < 0 ) rate for an arbitrary ring structure can be estimated from averaging all the local contraction / expansion events for individual ﬁlament pairs . To examine the effects of various parameters on overall ring contraction or expansion , we estimated a with a large number of random ring structures . The result of this analysis shows positive contraction rate a for a wide range of the ﬁlament orientation parameter z in the presence of actin depolymerization ( k > 0 ) ( Figures 6A and 6C ) . When the rate of actin depolymerization is zero , the myosin motor activity alone can lead to either contraction or expansion depending on ﬁlament orientation and the frequency of crosslinking for the ﬁlament conﬁgurations shown in Figure S2 ( Figure 6B ) . A Theoretical Prediction of the Mechanism by which Myosin II Drives Ring Constriction The observation that deletion of the Myo1 motor domain or MLC2 reduced the rate of actin depolymerization suggested that myosin II could contribute to ring constriction through two possible mechanisms : ( 1 ) the classical motor - driven ﬁlament sliding , and ( 2 ) actin depolymerization .

We consider the hypothetical case where Myo1 generates contractile force only through ﬁlament sliding without any impact on actin depolymer - ization . In this hypothetical cell the actin depolymerization - driven sliding ( k ) would be equal to that in myo1 D m , but the activity of the motor ( v ) would be preserved as that in the WT cells . Simulation of the model based on this assumption gave the normalized contraction rate in this hypothetical cell a h to be 0 . 0021 s (cid:2) 1 . Considering that the contribution of the motor to actin depoly - merization accounts for a contraction rate of a WT (cid:2) a h , and the total contribution of the motor to the contraction rate is a WT (cid:2) a D m , we estimate that 93 % of the motor activity contrib - utes to actin depolymerization , whereas only 7 % contributes to direct ﬁlament sliding . Contraction Rate Is Independent of the Initial Ring Size Recent observations of actomyosin ring constriction in devel - oping C . elegans early embryos revealed an intriguing invariant property , namely , the contraction time is independent of the cell size ( Carvalho et al . , 2009 ) . In other words , the contraction rate ( inverse of time in unit of s (cid:2) 1 ) as we deﬁned here is invariant with respect to different initial ring size . We note that in Carvalho et al . ‘‘rate’’ was used to denote contraction velocity measured in m m 3 s (cid:2) 1 , which scaled with cell size . The authors proposed a mechanism of ‘‘structural memory , ’’ referring to a certain precisely deﬁned and spaced contractile unit shortening at a constant rate , the number of which scales with cell size . It was speculated that the scaling of contraction velocity with cell size may be an important property of rapidly dividing early embryos where the egg cytoplasm is successively divided during cell cycles of similar time . To test if this phenomenon can be recapitulated by our model , we simulated rings of various initial sizes where larger rings on average contained proportion - ally large numbers of actin ﬁlaments with the same length and overlap distributions . This simulation found that , indeed , the contraction velocity scales with the initial ring size such that the duration of contraction is invariant ( Figure 7A ) . To test the aforementioned prediction , we investigated the relationship between the contraction rate and initial ring size at the bud neck . Because the natural variation of bud neck size is limited in a WT haploid population , we introduced the ﬂuorescent probes into totally congenic diploid ( 2N ) , triploid ( 3N ) , and tetra - ploid ( 4N ) strains ( Pavelka et al . , 2010 ) because cells of higher ploidy are in general larger in size , including the size of the bud neck , than cells of lower ploidy ( Figures 7B – 7F ) . Time - lapse measurements of cells ranging from 1N to 4N found that both the contraction rate a and the density loss rate b are invariant across cells with different bud neck diameters ( Figures 7E and 7F ) . This ﬁnding conﬁrmed our model prediction and suggests that the observed invariant contraction rate ( or time ) regardless of cell size is an intrinsic property of the actomyosin ring even in a unicellular organism . Interestingly , the initial density of the actin ring was also invariant across the range of bud neck sizes ( Figures 7C and 7D ) , which would be predicted by invariant L 0 and S 0 . DISCUSSION The Function of Myosin II during Budding Yeast Cytokinesis The role of the actomyosin ring and the mechanism by which force is generated to drive its constriction in dividing budding yeast cells have been a subject of considerable debate .

Developmental Cell Actin Depolymerization Drives Ring Contraction Developmental Cell 22 , 1247 – 1260 , June 12 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 1255 confusion largely stemmed from inconsistent phenotypes of MYO1 gene knockout reported by different labs ( Bi et al . , 1998 ; Rancati et al . , 2008 ; Tolliday et al . , 2003 ; Watts et al . , 1987 ) and the observation that Myo1 motor domain is not required for ring constriction . In the commonly used yeast strain backgrounds S288candW303a , MYO1 deletionleads toanearly complete cytokinesis failure and cell lethality in the euploid genomic background . In S288c , viable D myo1 spores with massive growth and cytokinesis defects do occur at low frequencies ( Rancati et al . , 2008 ; Tolliday et al . , 2003 ) ; however , upon further passage , innovation of novel cytokinetic mecha - nisms , not associated with formation of an actin ring , can be accomplished through aneuploidy ( Rancati et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , in the experimental model used in our studies ( S288c ) , Myo1 is indeed required for cytokinesis .

The results in this study help to resolve the aforementioned paradox by demonstrating that actin depolymerization , which occurs in the absence of the Myo1 motor activity , albeit at a slower rate , is a main mechanism for actomyosin ring constric - tion . Our experimental data and model analysis further indicate that the myosin II motor plays a role in actin depolymerization , although it is presently unclear whether this role could be direct , given that coﬁlin and myosin II binding to actin ﬁlaments are mutually exclusive ( Galkin et al . , 2011 ) . A previous study in mammalian cultured cells also reported that inhibition of myosin II ATPase activity with blebbistatin prevented actin turnover ( Guha et al . , 2005 ) . A role for myosin II in actin network disas - sembly was demonstrated recently in migrating ﬁsh keratocytes ( Wilson et al . , 2010 ) . Another recent study suggests that tail retraction of migrating ﬁbroblasts is a result of actin depolymer - ization , and myosin II facilitates this process by inﬂuencing ﬁlament alignment ( Mseka and Cramer , 2011 ) . Thus , promoting actin depolymerization may be a key function of the nonmuscle myosin II . Force Generation via Actin Depolymerization Force generation by depolymerizing cytoskeletal polymers is well known for the microtubule system . For example , microtu - bule depolymerization at the kinetochore contributes the force for poleward chromosome movement during anaphase ( Bouck et al . , 2008 ; Grishchuk et al . , 2005 ; Koshland et al . , 1988 ; Oguchi et al . , 2011 ) . During this process the linkage between kineto - chore and the shrinking microtubule ends must be dynamically maintained . Actin polymerization and depolymerization have mostly been considered for the generation of protrusive forces via elongation at the barbed ends of ﬁlaments , whereas pointed end dynamics have mainly been implicated in actin subunit recycling . The possibility of actin depolymerization to produce contractile stress was recently proposed in a theoretical paper ( Zumdieck et al . , 2007 ) and discussed in Sun et al . ( 2010 ) . Our observed effect of inhibition of actin depolymerization on the contraction rate provides the functional support for the idea of contractile force generation through actin depolymerization in the actomyosin ring . Coﬁlin ( Cof1 ) is the only essential actin - depolymerizing / severing protein in budding yeast and has been shown to promote rapid actin turnover in cortical actin patches and actin cables ( De La Cruz , 2009 ; Fan et al . , 2008 ; Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Moon et al . , 1993 ) . Our results show that Cof1 also regulates actin depolymerization in the contractile ring and plays an important role in ring contraction . Although several previous studies have clearly implicated ADF / coﬁlin in actomy - osin ring assembly and / or contraction ( Hotulainen et al . , 2005 ; Kaji et al . , 2003 ; Nakano and Mabuchi , 2006 ; Theriot , 1997 ) , the precise functional consequence of coﬁlin - mediated actin depolymerization in cytokinesis has been unclear . Our analysis suggests that coﬁlin can be a key component of the force - generating machinery during cytokinesis . The action of coﬁlin must be augmented by actin crosslinking in order to generate contractile stress ( Zumdieck et al . , 2007 ) . Our model suggests that such crosslinker does not need to track depolymerizing actin ends , as long as there is some probability ( g ) for reestab - lishing the crosslinking after ﬁlament shortening ( Figure 5A ) . Iqg1 is a potential candidate for the critical actin crosslinker in our model because it is an actin crosslinker essential for cytokinesis ( Epp and Chant , 1997 ; Lippincott and Li , 1998b ) . The constant value of g assumed in the model implies that the crosslinker concentration in the ring should be constant during constriction , which was indeed observed for Iqg1 ( data not shown ) . A Quantitative Microscopic Model for Depolymerization - Driven Actomyosin Ring Contraction The study of actomyosin - based contractile structures in different systems has led to models that consider different types of organization of actin ﬁlaments undergoing myosin motor - driven sliding ( Carlsson , 2006 ; Carvalho et al . , 2009 ; Stachowiak and O’Shaughnessy , 2009 ; Zemel and Mogilner , 2009 ; Zumdieck et al . , 2007 ) . The model proposed by Carlsson ( 2006 ) relies on actin turnover to ensure that the action of the motor leads to contraction and predicts that the contraction rate is limited by the rate of actin treadmilling . Another model by Stachowiak and O’Shaughnessy ( 2009 ) is characterized by a speciﬁc organi - zation of stress ﬁbers in which active myosin is placed with constant spacing , and the polarity of actin ﬁlaments alternates periodically along the ﬁber axis . Both these models assume the myosin motor being the necessary contractile stress generator . The model of Zumdieck et al . ( 2007 ) illuminates the possibility of actin depolymerization coupled with ﬁlament crosslinking to constitute an alternative driving force for ﬁlament sliding . The actin ﬁlaments are assumed to undergo treadmilling , which may be consistent with the observation made in ﬁssion yeast by Pelham and Chang ( 2002 ) . The bottom - up model , based on microscopic elements of dynamic actin ﬁlaments , actin crosslinker , and myosin II motor , allowed us to compute macroscopic parameters describing contraction dynamics to compare with the experimentally measured values . An attractive feature of our model is the lack of requirement for precise ﬁlament conﬁguration . Three - dimensional electron microscopy reconstruction of the ﬁssion yeast contractile ring at the start or during contraction showed a mixed ﬁlament polarity with perhaps a slight bias in one orien - tation ( Kamasaki et al . , 2007 ) . The model predicts that indeed no bias in ﬁlament orientation is required for the ring contraction ( Figure 6 ) , but a small nonzero z is needed to obtain the observed rate of the actin loss in the contracting ring . Our model correctly predicts the independence of contraction rate ( or time ) on the initial size of the actomyosin ring . This phenomenon was recently reported for early C . elegans embryos undergoing rapid mitotic cleavages ( Carvalho et al . , 2009 ) . The observation in yeast suggests that this property is a predictable outcome of an evolutionarily conserved aspect of actomyosin ring mechanics rather than an evolutionary innovation to accomplish precisely timed , consecutive embryonic divisions . In contrast to the model proposed by Carvalho et al . ( 2009 ) , our model does not require spatially separate structural units of a ﬁxed size , but rather , actin ﬁlaments can vary randomly in orientation , length , and the amount of overlap within the deﬁned distributions . Having overlapping ﬁlaments throughout the ring is likely to be important for maintaining its structural integrity during contraction and is also consistent with the electron microscopy Developmental Cell Actin Depolymerization Drives Ring Contraction Developmental Cell 22 , 1247 – 1260 , June 12 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 1257 reconstruction of the ﬁssion yeast ring ( Kamasaki et al . , 2007 ) . Finally , although our model simulation predicts that in budding yeast actin depolymerization is the main mechanism driving actomyosin ring constriction , the model itself does not exclude a direct role for the motor and may thus be generalizable toward systems where ﬁlament sliding is more predominantly driven by myosin II . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Yeast Strains and Plasmids Media and genetic techniques were as previously described ( Sherman et al . , 1974 ) . Yeast strains and plasmid construction are in Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) . Live Imaging and Image Analysis Three - dimensionalconfocalimagingwasaccomplishedusingaCarlZeiss510 Meta laser - scanning microscope equipped with a Confocor 3 detection unit . This detection unit employs single - photon counting avalanche photodi - odes thatarecrucial forhighlysensitiveandquantitativeimagingofcontractile ring dynamics in yeast cells with native expression levels . For this study , two general methods were employed . For time - lapse imaging to observe density changes , it was crucial to avoid photobleaching . Therefore , the pinhole was set completely open with relatively low - laser power , and a Carl Zeiss C - Apochromat 40 3 1 . 2 NA water objective was used . Under this condition , no photobleaching was observed in our time - lapse movies . All image processing was done using ImageJ , a free open source Java program from the NIH combined with several custom plug - ins written in - house . For diameter measurements a thick line was drawn through the bud neck parallel to the ring such that the thickness of the line encompassed the observed thickness of the ring ( Figure S1A ) . A summed and smoothed proﬁle of this region as a function of time represents a kymograph from which the background intensity was subtracted . For each time point proﬁle , the maximum intensity value was measured . Then the diameter deﬁned as the proﬁle width at the half - maximum level was computed by searching inward from each edge of the proﬁle and then interpolating near the half - maximum ( Figure S1B ) . Because our measurements were near the limit of optical resolu - tion , we measured the distance between the positions of the proﬁle peaks representing the initial ring diameter and compared it to the half - maximum width measurement . We found that the difference was roughly 350 nm . The endtimepointofthecontractionprocess foreachindividualcellmeasurement was deﬁned as the time when the measured diameter reaches this critical value ( see Figure S1B ) . The start point of the contraction phase was deter - minedasthestartpoint ofthediametercurve’slinearsegment ( seeFigure2A ) , which often correlates in time to a sudden inward movement of the spindle pole bodies , labeled with Spc42 - mCherry , an event caused by spindle breaking down at mitotic exit . To generate the contraction curves , each diameter measurement was normalized to the initial diameter determined as the average of the ten time points before the start of contraction . The normal - ized contraction rate was computed in Mathematica ( Wolfram Research , Champaign , IL , USA ) as the slope of a linear ﬁtting of the diameter proﬁle during the deﬁned contraction window . All images for presentation were adjusted for contrast to clearly show the maximum and minimum intensities . See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for the methods for actin density measurements . Estimate of a and b To estimate a and b from experimental measurements of ring diameter and intensity changes over contraction time ( e . g . , plots in Figure 2A ) , we used the following approximation : D ð t Þ = D ð 0 Þ exp ð(cid:2) a $ t Þ z D ð 0 Þð 1 (cid:2) a $ t Þ ; where the last expression is obtained as the leading one in expansion when a is small . If a is constant , this approximation leads to the constant speed of contraction ( measured in m m / s ) , as observed ( Figure 2A ) , which is equal to a D ð 0 Þ and scales with the initial ring diameter . Similar reasoning leads to approximated protein density dynamics c ð t Þ = c ð 0 Þ exp ð(cid:2) b $ t Þ z c ð 0 Þð 1 (cid:2) b $ t Þ . Again , it is important to remind that a and b have the dimension of s (cid:2) 1 , not m m / s . Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis of the data was performed in Mathematica and Excel . The p values were determined by the Student’s t test . Model Computation Model simulations were made using custom code written in Mathematica . The initial orientation , size , and position of actin ﬁlaments were gen - erated randomly using built - in Mathematica random number generator . The search for model parameters , such as the clustering coefﬁcient z and the frequency g of productive actin depolymerization , was made by running , for each parameter set in the range (cid:2) 1 < z < 1 with the step 0 . 1 and 0 < g < 1 with the step 0 . 05 , 200 simulations starting with random initial ﬁlament structures , computing the average values of contraction rate a and actin loss rate b . The values of other parameters were selected as follows : initial ﬁlament mean size and SD were L 0 = 1 and d L = 0 . 15 , respectively ; the over - lapping mean size and SD were S 0 = 0 . 75 and d S = 0 . 25 , respectively ; and initial number of ﬁlaments was 20 . The depolymerization rate was chosen to be equal to k = 0 . 01 and the myosin motor speed v = 0 . 0025 for the WT simulation . For the motorless simulation the depolymerization rate was reduced to k = 0 . 0061 , and myosin motor speed v was set to zero . To obtain a ﬁner resolution in the subregion in the parameter space in the range 0 . 2 < z , g < 0 . 4 , similar computations were done 300 times for each parameter set with step size of 0 . 02 in both parameters . In the simulation for the case of cof1 - 22 mutant , the values k = 0 . 0076 and v = 0 . 0025 were used . For the simulations for different initial neck size , 10 , 15 , 20 , and 25 were used as the initial number of ﬁlaments .
