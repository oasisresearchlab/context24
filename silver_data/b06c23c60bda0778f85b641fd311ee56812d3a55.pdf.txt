Product creativity assessment of innovations : considering the creative process - DTU Orbit ( 20 / 02 / 2019 ) Product creativity assessment of innovations : considering the creative process Creativity is a critical component that feeds into all stages of innovation and design processes by promoting inspiration , ideation , and implementation of ideas , revealing the need for thorough research to support design creativity . Assessment of product creativity is a reoccurring topic in creativity research , while the role of consumer’s knowledge of the creative process behind the product is fairly unexplored . In this paper , we present an empirical study investigating whether providing information about a complex development process could amplify consumer’s perception of product creativity . Does storytelling about the process contribute to amplifying creativity ratings ? What form of storytelling is needed to make an impact ? Results from 134 respondents showed a small but not significant amplifying effect from the additional process information ; however , an important learning can be drawn about the form of storytelling needed . An absolute minimal form was chosen here , displaying the need for investigating other , more elaborate forms . Additionally , the analysis showed that creativity was an important driver for the assessment of other product attributes such as purchasability , portraying the importance of design creativity and underlining the importance of further investigating the role of creative process information in amplifying consumer’s perception of creativity in products .
