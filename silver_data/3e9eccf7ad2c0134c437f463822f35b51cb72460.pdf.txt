Cullen 1 , 9 Following endocytosis into the endosomal network , integral membrane proteins undergo sorting for lysosomal degradation or are retrieved and recycled back to the cell surface . Here we describe the discovery of an ancient and conserved multiprotein complex that orchestrates cargo retrieval and recycling and , importantly , is biochemically and functionally distinct from the established retromer pathway . We have called this complex ‘retriever’ ; it is a heterotrimer composed of DSCR3 , C16orf62 and VPS29 , and bears striking similarity to retromer . We establish that retriever associates with the cargo adaptor sorting nexin 17 ( SNX17 ) and couples to CCC ( CCDC93 , CCDC22 , COMMD ) and WASH complexes to prevent lysosomal degradation and promote cell surface recycling of α 5 β 1 integrin . Through quantitative proteomic analysis , we identify over 120 cell surface proteins , including numerous integrins , signalling receptors and solute transporters , that require SNX17 – retriever to maintain their surface levels . Our identiﬁcation of retriever establishes a major endosomal retrieval and recycling pathway . Central to the biogenesis and homeostasis of all eukaryotic organelles is the delivery and removal of integral membrane proteins . A major nexus for transport of integral membrane proteins is the endosomal network 1 . Here the fate of integral membrane proteins and their asso - ciated proteins and lipids ( termed ‘cargoes’ ) is determined . Cargoes are either traﬃcked to the lysosome for degradation or recycled to organelles that include the plasma membrane and the trans - Golgi network 2 . Consistent with the fundamental role of the network in establishing and maintaining organelle function , perturbations in the network are increasingly associated with human disease 3 . Sorting of cargo for lysosomal degradation is mediated by the ESCRT complexes 4 . Conversely , retromer controls the retrieval of cargo from the lysosomal degradative fate and promotes recycling back to the cell surface 5 . Formed by the stable association of VPS26 , VPS35 and VPS29 ( ref . 6 ) , this ancient and evolutionarily conserved complex recognizes sorting signals within the intracellular cytosolic domain of cargo proteins either directly or indirectly via thecargoadaptorsortingnexin - 27 ( SNX27 ) 7 – 19 . Retromercoordinates sequence - dependent cargo capture with the recruitment of the WASH complex , an activator of Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization 20 – 24 . This drives the formation of endosomal actin - enriched subdomains thatcorralcapturedcargoandcouplesthiswithbiogenesisoftransport carriers to allow for cargo recycling 25 . Numerous cargoes , including α 5 β 1 integrin , do not depend on retromer for their retrieval and recycling back to the cell surface 26 . How these cargo are retrieved in a retromer - independent manner remains unclear . Given that mechanistic analysis of endosomal cargo sorting is allowing a greater understanding of the pathoetiology of human disease 27 – 31 , we have sought to identify and characterize evo - lutionarily conserved retromer - independent cargo sorting machinery . Here we report the discovery of retriever , a multiprotein complex that is essential for retromer - independent retrieval and recycling of numerous cargoes that include α 5 β 1 integrin . RESULTS Proteomic identiﬁcation of retromer - independent endosomal sorting machinery Endosomal retrieval and recycling of internalized β 1 integrin is mediated through the cargo adaptor SNX17 ( refs 26 , 32 ) .

SNX17 - mediated sorting of β 1 integrin occurs independently of retromer 26 . We have used GFP - nanotrap immunocapture coupled with SILAC ( stable isotope labelling with amino acids in culture ) - based quanti - tative proteomics to identify endosomal sorting complexes 18 , 27 , 38 . To establish this methodology for SNX17 , we first validated that GFP - tagging of SNX17 did not aﬀect its function . GFP - SNX17 ( a fusion protein with a ten - amino - acid linker between the GFP and the amino terminus of SNX17 ) and SNX17 - GFP ( a fusion protein with a seven amino acid linker between the carboxy terminus of SNX17 and GFP ) bothlocalizedtoendosomesandboundtotheNPxY - motif - containing SNX17 cargo , LRP1 ( refs 35 , 36 ) ( Fig . 1a – c ) . In rescues of a SNX17 loss of function 26 , 32 , GFP - SNX17 fully rescued the α 5 β 1 integrin sorting while SNX17 - GFP failed to rescue it ( Fig . 1d and Supplementary Fig . 1A ) . Since localization and cargo binding of SNX17 - GFP was unperturbed , we hypothesized that the C - terminal GFP tag uncou - ples the SNX17 cargo adaptor from downstream endosomal sorting machineries . We therefore designed a comparative proteomic analysis in human RPE - 1 cells , transduced to express at equivalent levels GFP - SNX17 or SNX17 - GFP ( Fig . 1e , f ) . This unbiased and quanti - tative approach identified a subset of proteins that associated with GFP - SNX17 but failed to bind to SNX17 - GFP ( Fig . 1g and Supple - mentary Table 1 ) . Among these proteins were CCDC22 , CCDC93 , and seven of the ten human COMMDs . These form the CCC com - plex 39 , shown to be required for the endosomal recycling of certain cargoes 39 , 40 . Additional proteins identified included the CCC com - plex associated C16orf62 ( ref . 39 ) , DSCR3 and the retromer subunit VPS29 . Associations ( with the exception of VPS29 ) were validated by western analysis of immunoprecipitates from exogenously expressed ( GFP - SNX17 and SNX17 - GFP ) and endogenous SNX17 ( Fig . 1h , i ) . Importantly , C16orf62 , DSCR3 , CCDC22 and CCDC93 did not associate with retromer or SNX27 , leading us to hypothesize that they form a retromer - independent protein - sorting machine ( s ) ( Fig . 1h ) . Like suppression of SNX17 ( refs 26 , 32 ) , siRNA suppression of CCDC22 , CCDC93 , C16orf62 and DSCR3 led to a pronounced loss of cell surface α 5 β 1 integrin and enrichment in LAMP1 - positive late endosomes / lysosomes due to lysosomal mis - sorting instead of recycling ( Fig . 2a ) . This phenotype was also observed in a VPS29 - knockout ( KO ) HeLa line and was rescued by re - expression of VPS29 ( Fig . 2b ) . Biochemical analysis of α 5 β 1 integrin stability revealed an increased rate of degradation in VPS29 - KO HeLa cells , which was rescued by re - expression of VPS29 ( Supplementary Fig . 1B – D ) . In contrast , VPS35 - KO cells ( targeting retromer ) did not show this phenotype ( Supplementary Fig . 1B – D ) . Suppression of CCDC22 , CCDC93 and C16orf62 also phenocopied a loss of SNX17 as defined through the biochemical analysis of α 5 β 1 integrin sorting ( Fig . 2c – f ) . These proteins are therefore linked with SNX17 - mediated sorting of α 5 β 1 integrin . DSCR3 , C16orf62 and VPS29 form a heterotrimer with similarity to retromer Using HHPred , the C - terminal region of human C16orf62 ( residues 717 – 1030 ) is predicted , with 99 . 8 % probability , to contain a HEAT - repeat protein fold similar to that observed in VPS35 ( ref . 41 ) . Using the published structure of the C terminus of VPS35 ( ref . 41 ) , we were able , with minor deletions and insertions , to model the C terminus of C16orf62 ( Fig . 3a ) . Taken with the functional and physical link with the retromer subunit VPS29 and DSCR3 , which is considered to be a paralogue of VPS26 ( ref . 42 ) , this led us to speculate that C16orf62 , DSCR3 and VPS29 may be part of a retromer - like assembly . Immuno - isolation of GFP - VPS35 or GFP - C16orf62 established that DSCR3 associated with C16orf62 but not with retromer and that VPS29 associated with both retromer and C16orf62 ( Fig . 3b ) . Immunoprecipitation of endogenous C16orf62 confirmed the association with DSCR3 and VPS29 ( Fig . 3c ) . Next we turned to MultiBac technology for the expression and isolation of multiprotein assemblies from insect cells 43 . Through design of a bacmid for the co - expression of Strep - tagged DSCR3 , untagged C16orf62 and VPS29 - tagged with 6 × His ( Supplementary Fig . 2A ) , we observed the expression of all three proteins in a crude insect cell lysate ( Fig . 3d ) . Through lysate application to Talon resin followed by rounds of washes and elution of bound proteins , we observed the co - elution of C16orf62 and Strep - DSCR3 together with VPS29 - 6 × His ( Fig . 3d ) . Application of the concentrated eluate from the Talon resin to a size - exclusion column established that Strep - DSCR3 , C16orf62 and VPS29 - 6 × His co - eluted as a complex with an apparent relative molecular mass of 325 , 000 ( M r 325K ; Fig . 3e and Supplementary Fig . 2B , C ) . The predicted relative molecular mass of the C16orf62 , DSCR3 and VPS29 heterotrimeric complex is 171K , suggesting that the heterotrimer assembly may form a dimeric complexundertheseconditions . Weproposetocallthisheterotrimeric complex ‘retriever’ ( Fig . 3f ) . We also analysed the eﬀects of selected protein suppression on retriever stability ( Fig . 3g , h ) . RNA interference ( RNAi ) - mediated silencing of SNX17 had no eﬀect on retriever , retromer or CCC com - plex levels . Similarly , suppression of the CCC complex did not reduce retriever or retromer , suggesting that retriever assembly is distinct from the CCC complex . Suppression of C16orf62 reduced DSCR3 but had no eﬀect on retromer . VPS35 suppression reduced expression of theretromerpartnerVPS26Aandreduced , by32 % , thelevelsofVPS29 while DSCR3 and C16orf62 expression levels were unaﬀected . While VPS29 suppression reduced both retriever and retromer , consistent with its shared presence in these complexes , the relative levels of reduction were distinct : retromer was consistently more reduced ( only 17 % of VPS35 and 19 % of VPS26 remained ) than retriever ( 51 % of C16orf62and55 % ofDSCR3remained ) ( Fig . 3e , f ) . Togetherthesedata support the DSCR3 , C16orf62 and VPS29 retriever complex . Retriever and retromer utilize distinct targeting mechanisms to reside on the same endosomal subdomain To probe the distinction between retriever and retromer further we examined the localization of retriever . Using an antibody against endogenous C16orf62 , we observed colocalization with the other retriever components on SNX17 - labelled endosomes that were also positive for retromer and the WASH complex ( Supplementary Fig . 3A – C ) . Swelling of individual endosomes through expression of a constitutively active Rab5 ( ref . 44 ) established that endogenous retriever and retromer resided on the same endosomal subdomain and that this ‘retrieval’ subdomain was distinct from the ESCRT ‘degradative’ subdomain ( Fig . 4a ) .

Suppression of the CCC complex , however , perturbed the localization of retriever to endosomes without aﬀecting retromer ( Fig . 4c , d and Supplementary Fig . 4A ) . Endosomal association of the CCC complex requires the WASH complex component FAM21 ( ref . 39 ) . FAM21 is recruited to endosomes through binding to retromer 20 – 22 . In VPS35 - KO cells , retriever retained association with endosomes ( as defined by SNX1 ) , although at slightly reduced levels ( Fig . 4e ) . This is consistent with retromer not being essential for SNX17 and retriever - dependent sort - ing of α 5 β 1 integrin ( Supplementary Fig . 1B – D ) . Interestingly , even though FAM21 became more cytosolic in our VPS35 - KO cells , a significant pool of FAM21 retained association with SNX1 - labelled endosomes ( Fig . 4e ) . FAM21 and the WASH complex are there - fore recruited to endosomes through retromer - dependent 20 , 21 and retromer - independent mechanism ( s ) . In a FAM21 - KO HeLa cell line , retriever was cytosolic while the localization of SNX1 was unaﬀected ( Fig . 4f and Supplementary Fig . 4B ) . Moreover , the loss of retriever localization translated into a functional phenotype , as FAM21 - KO cells displayed α 5 β 1 integrin mis - sorting into lysosomes ( Fig . 4g and Supplementary Fig . 4C ) . Only minor lysosomal mis - sorting was observed in the corresponding VPS35 - KO HeLa cells ( Fig . 4g and Supplementary Fig . 4C ) . This minor phenotype may arise from the partial loss of FAM21 from endosomes and hence a partial loss of retriever endosome association . From these data , we propose a working model ( Fig . 4h ) where the WASH complex is localized to endosomes via a retromer - independent mechanism that may rely on the ability of the WASH complex to bind lipids 21 , 23 . WASH recruits the CCC complex through direct interactions of CCDC93 with FAM21 ( ref . 39 ) . The CCC complex aids the recruitment of retriever to the endosomal membrane where it can engage the SNX17 cargo adaptor . In this way , the endosomal sorting of SNX17 cargoes is achieved independently of retromer via a WASH pathway that relies on retriever and the CCC complex . Evolutionary analysis suggests that retriever and the CCC and WASH complexes have co - evolved Retromer is present in all eukaryotes and DSCR3 duplicated from VPS26 before the VPS26 duplication into VPS26A and VPS26B ( ref . 42 ) . However , some species have not retained DSCR3 ( ref . 42 ) . We used the CLIME computational algorithm 47 to map the evolutionary conservation of retriever . This algorithm identifies species in which the gene of interest is conserved and generates evolutionarily conserved modules of genes that are inferred to have co - evolved with the target gene . When C16orf62 was used , the CCC and the WASH complexes were strongly inferred to have co - evolved with retriever ( Supplementary Fig . 4C ) . This agrees with the WASH complex being essential for the recruitment and function of the CCC complex and retriever ( Fig . 4f , g ) 39 . These complexes also have an ancient origin , being present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor . However , retriever , the CCC and WASH complexes are selectively lost in some species , including all fungi , which have retained retromer 7 . Retriever interacts with the evolutionarily conserved C - terminal tail of SNX17 To address how SNX17 associates with the WASH – CCC – retriever axis , we performed SNX17 immunoprecipitations in CCDC22 - and CCDC93 - KO HeLa cell lines . Under these conditions , the association of endogenous SNX17 with retriever was unaﬀected ( Fig . 5a and SupplementaryFig . 5A ) . Incontrast , CRISPR – Cas9 - mediateddeletion of DSCR3 abrogated the interaction of SNX17 with retriever and the CCC complex , which could be rescued by DSCR3 re - expression ( Fig . 5a ) . Importantly , DSCR3 deficiency did not aﬀect the expression of CCDC22 , CCDC93 or C16orf62 , neither did it aﬀect their subcellular localization or their ability to form the CCC complex ( Fig . 5a and Supplementary Fig . 5B – E ) . DSCR3 null cells did however display defective recycling of α 5 β 1 integrin ( Supplementary Fig . 5F , G ) . SNX17 therefore probably associates with retriever via DSCR3 . To further evaluate the association of SNX17 with retriever , we re - focused on our observation that occlusion of the C - terminal tail of SNX17 has a pronounced eﬀect on α 5 β 1 integrin sorting ( Fig . 1d ) . Indeed , this tail was necessary for SNX17 to associate with retriever ( Fig . 5b , c and Supplementary Fig . 6A ) . Fusion of the last 68 amino acids of SNX17 ( residues 402 – 470 ) onto SNX3 , an unrelated sort - ing nexin that does not associate with retriever ( Fig . 4b ) , resulted in the complete transfer of retriever binding ( Fig . 5d ) . Deletion of the last four evolutionarily conserved residues of human SNX17 ( residues 467 – 470 ) , or a point mutation of the conserved terminal residue , SNX17 ( L470G ) , was suﬃcient to abrogate retriever binding ( Fig . 5e – g ) . These mutants retained endosomal association and the ability to bind to NPxY cargo ( Fig . 5f , g and Supplementary Fig . 6B ) . SNX31 , acloselyrelatedproteintoSNX17 ( ref . 48 ) , alsoassociateswith retriever through a similar C - terminal motif ( Fig . 5e and Supplemen - tary Fig . 6C ) . SNX17 - KO HeLa cell lines displayed a strong α 5 β 1 integrin phe - notype ( Fig . 6a – c and Supplementary Fig . 7A , B ) . In these cells , only re - expression of wild - type SNX17 rescued α 5 β 1 integrin recy - cling , while the SNX17 ( L470G ) mutant completely failed to rescue it ( Fig . 6d – g ) . Retriever and the CCC complex are highly evolutionarily con - served ( Supplementary Fig . 4D ) and SNX17 is conserved in Drosophila melanogaster ( Fig . 5e ) . We therefore generated a fusion protein comprising human SNX3 linked to the last 99 amino acids of Drosophila Snx17 ( CG5734 ) . When expressed in human HEK293 cells , this chimaera displayed the ability to bind to human retriever , an interaction that was lost with the C - terminal Drosophila Snx17 ( L490G ) mutant ( Fig . 6h ) . The mechanism of SNX17 associa - tion with retriever is therefore highly conserved and this interaction is essential for SNX17 – retriever - mediated retrieval and recycling of α 5 β 1 integrin . SNX17 and the retriever pathway are required for the retrieval and recycling of numerous cell surface cargoes Previously , we have used unbiased global proteomics to quantify the dependency of the cell surface proteome on the SNX27 – retromer endosomal retrieval and recycling pathway 18 . We applied this methodology to achieve a system - level view of the SNX17 – retriever pathway . In three independent experiments , using siRNA to knockdown SNX17 in SILAC - labelled HeLa cells , we biotinylated the 1220 © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

Gene ontology analysis indicated that this data set was enriched in integral proteins requiredforcelladhesion , suchasintegrinsandothercellularadhesion molecules , including protocadherin - 7 and plexin A1 . A wide array of distinct nutrient transporters including SLC7A11 ( cysteine / glutamate transporter ) , SLC9A6 ( sodium / hydrogen exchanger ) , SLC6A15 ( a neutral amino acid transporter ) and a plethora of signalling receptors such as TYRO3 , ROR1 and MET were also decreased ( Fig . 7b , c ) . Some of these proteins contain NxxY motifs previously shown in vitro to bind to SNX17 ( ref . 37 ) , consistent with a role for SNX17 in the recycling of these cargoes ( Fig . 7b ) . To validate the role of retriever , we analysed LRP1 , an established SNX17 cargo 33 . The steady - state cell surface level of LRP1 was dependent on a functional retriever complex ( Supplementary Fig . 7D ) . We next compared the cell surface proteome of SNX17 - depleted cells with our published cell surface proteomes in VPS35 - or SNX27 - suppressed cells ( Fig . 7e ) . SNX17 cargo such as β 1 integrin was only reduced at the cell surface following SNX17 suppression , consistent with the SNX17 – retriever pathway not needing retromer for its func - tion . However , a population of SNX17 - dependent integral proteins do have reduced plasma membrane levels under SNX27 or retromer suppression , suggesting that for these cargoes their recycling may be mediated by both retriever and retromer pathways ( Figs 7e and 4a ) . 1222 © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

Consistent with this , suppression of retriever and the CCC complex reduced the number of HPV pseudovirions reaching the nucleus , thus indicating the essential role of retriever in HPV infection and sug - gesting that retriever may also be involved in retrograde endosome - to - TGN transport ( Fig . 7f and Supplementary Fig . 7E ) . Together these data indicate that the discovered SNX17 – retriever pathway is essential for regulating the cell surface expression of many integral proteins and is exploited by at least one viral pathogen .

The complex is composed of a heterotrimer of DSCR3 , C16orf62 and VPS29 , and we have called it ‘retriever’ . In associating with the CCC and the WASH complexes , retriever localizes to endosomes to drive the retrieval and recycling of NPxY / NxxY - motif - containing cargo proteins by coupling to SNX17 ( and SNX31 ) , a cargo adaptor essential for the homeostatic maintenance of numerous cell surface proteins associated with processes that include cell migration , cell adhesion , nutrient supply and cell signalling . This ancient transport route is distinct from the retromer pathway ( Fig . 4h ) . Retriever draws many parallels with retromer . The most obvi - ous being that the two complexes share a similar composition and architecture ; retriever and retromer are heterotrimers that contain a VPS29 subunit , a protein with an arrestin - like fold ( DSCR3 or VPS26A / B respectively ) and a protein containing HEAT repeats ( C16orf62 or VPS35 respectively ) . In addition , each complex asso - ciates with a cargo - specific adaptor ; SNX17 with retriever and SNX27 with retromer , thereby providing sequence - selective cargo entry into these retrieval pathways . A further similarity between retriever and retromer is their dependency on the WASH complex . The retromer subunit VPS35 binds to FAM21 and this interaction is suggested to be suﬃcient and essential to recruit the WASH complex to endosomes 20 , 21 . We have shown , however , that in a VPS35 - KO cell line , a significant proportion of FAM21 remains associated with the endosomal network . This establishes that in human cells the endosomal association of FAM21 – WASH is mediated through retromer - dependent and retromer - independent mechanisms , a conclusion that is in agreement with work in Dictyostelium describing the retromer - independent recruitment of the WASH complex 52 . While the mechanism for retromer - independent association of the WASH complex with endosomes remains to be established it is perhaps worth noting that the WASH complex has an inherent ability to bind to phospholipids 21 , 23 . Our data are consistent with retriever interacting with FAM21 through the CCC complex 39 . The WASH – FAM21 – CCC axis is essential for the localization of retriever to endosomes , which is consistent with these complexes having co - evolved . Importantly , identification of the WASH – FAM21 – CCC – retriever – SNX17 pathway provides a mechanism to account for several studies that have shown a role for the WASH complex in α 5 β 1 integrin recycling even though the sorting of this cargo is known to be retromer - independent 26 , 52 – 54 . The establishment of functionally distinct retriever – WASH and retromer – WASH pathways serves to further highlight the essential role that the WASH complex plays in the organization and function of the endosomal network . Interestingly , retriever , retromer and the WASH and CCC complexes are all spatially overlapping in an endosomal ‘retrieval’ subdomain . Quantifying the global eﬀect of SNX17 suppression on the cell sur - face proteome has implicated the retriever pathway in the regulation of cell adhesion , nutrient supply and cell signalling . In demonstrat - ing that the NPxY / NxxY - motif - containing L2 capsid protein of HPV hijacks the retriever pathway , we have also provided initial evidence of the importance of this pathway in the infectivity of at least one viral pathogen . Finally , on the basis of our data , we propose that C16orf62 should be renamed VPS35 - like ( VPS35L ) and DSCR3 should be renamed to VPS26C ( ref . 42 ) . Therefore , the retriever becomes VPS26C : VPS35L : VPS29 . Thus , while retriever and retromer clearly play distinct roles in endosomal recycling , their shared basic design suggests a conserved underlying principle that governs their function .

SILAC interactome proteomics . SILAC - based interactomes were generated as previously described 26 . Briefly , GFP - , GFP - SNX17 - and SNX17 - GFP - transduced RPE - 1 cells were grown in light ( R0K0 ) , medium ( R6K4 ) or heavy ( R10K8 ) SILAC media respectively for at least six doublings . Cells were lysed in lysis buﬀer ( 40mM Tris - HCl , 0 . 5 % NP40 , 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail , pH 7 . 5 ) . Cell lysates were cleared before GFP was immunoisolated using Chromotek GFP - nanotrap beads at 4 ◦ C for 1h . Beads were thoroughly washed with lysis buﬀer and then beads from the three conditions were pooled . GFP and interacting proteins were eluted from beads in 2 × NuPAGE LDS Sample Buﬀer ( Life Technologies ) . Proteins were then separated by SDS – PAGE and analysed by LC – MS / MS mass spectrometry . MassspectrometrydatahavebeendepositedinProteomeXchangewiththeprimaryaccessioncodePXD007230 . Quantitative cell surface proteomics . HeLa cells were labelled with medium ( R6K4 ) or heavy ( R10K8 ) SILAC media for at least six doublings to allow for full labelling . After full labelling was achieved , medium - or heavy - labelled cells were suppressed using either non - targeting or SNX17 - targeting siRNA respectively and HiPerfect ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Cells were surface biotinylated 72h post siRNA transfection with membrane - impermeable biotin ( Thermo ) at 4 ◦ C to prevent endocytosis . Post - biotinylation , cells were lysed ( 1 % Triton X - 100 , PBS , 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail tablet ( Roche ) pH 7 . 5 ) and lysateswereclearedbycentrifugation .

Proteins were separated by SDS – PAGE and analysed by mass spectroscopy as previously reported 18 . Mass spectrometry data have been deposited in ProteomeXchange with the primary accession code PXD007230 . Overlap PCR . SNX3 - SNX17 and SNX3 - Drosophila - SNX17 chimaeras were generated using overlap PCR . SNX3 and tail regions of SNX17 / Drosophila SNX17 were amplified using PCR and subsequently purified . The PCR primers were designed so that the antisense SNX3 primer and the sense SNX17 tail primer contained a DNA sequence encoding a glycine – serine linker ( 3 × GS , ggtagcggcagcggtagc ) at the 5 (cid:48) . A second round of PCR then occurred using SNX3 sense and SNX17 antisense primers and the purified SNX3 and SNX17 fragments from the previous PCR reactions as DNA templates . The 3 × GS linker linked to the fragments in the first PCR reaction were then annealed to each other during the annealing stage of a second PCR . This enabled the DNA polymerase to extend the DNA sequence from the annealed linker as well as from the 5 (cid:48) and 3 (cid:48) ends of the fragments using the primers added , thus generating a chimaeric PCR product that contained SNX3 linked to SNX17 tail via the 3X GS amino acid linker . Sequences of PCR primers are provided in Supplementary Table 4 . Site - directed mutagenesis . Point mutations of various constructs were generated using site - directed mutagenesis . PCR primers that contain desired mutations were designed using the Aligent Technologies QuikChange Primer Design Programme ( https : / / www . genomics . agilent . com / primerDesignProgram . jsp ) . Sequences of PCR primers are provided in Supplementary Table 4 . After PCR , non - mutated template vector was removed from the PCR mixture through digestion for 1h at 37 ◦ C by the enzyme Dpn1 . Following digestion by Dpn1 , 1 µ l of the mixture was transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli and plated on suitable antibiotic - containing agar plates . Several colonies were picked and cultured overnight and plasmid DNA was purified . Sequencing of purified plasmid DNA established whether the desired mutation had been introduced . Cell culture . Cells were grown in incubators at 37 ◦ C , 5 % CO 2 . All tissue culturing materials were sterile and tissue culture was performed in Class II vertical laminar flow cabinets . All cell lines were obtained from ATCC . Cell lines were not authenticated or tested for mycoplasma contamination . Transfection of constructs . HEK cells for GFP immunoprecipitation were transfected using a PEI transfection agent . HEK cells were split a day before transfection so that they would be 80 – 90 % confluent on the day of transfection . For a 10cm dish , 2 . 5ml Optimen was added to 0 . 5 µ l PEI and this mixture was filtered . DNA ( 7 . 5 µ g ) was added to 2 . 5ml Optimen in a separate tube . Then the two tubes were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 20min . Medium was removed from the cell dishes , cells washed in PBS and the DNA PEI mixture added to the dish . The transfection mixture was removed 6h later and medium was replaced on the cells . Cells were then left for 48h . HeLacellsforimaginganalysisweretransfectedusingFuGene .

The following siRNA oligonucleotides were used ( 5 (cid:48) – 3 (cid:48) ) : SNX17 ( ccagugauguccacggcaa ) , C16orf62 ( acaaugccuugcuguugaa , aua gucauccaguguuca , aucguuccuucuggaauuc ) , DSCR3 ( guaacaaaguucuguauga , caaacu gugucaucacgca ) , VPS29 ( augugaaaguagaacgaau , caagugaaacuacggauau , ugagaggaga cuucgauga , auauuaaaguggacgagau ) , CCDC22 ( ccacugagcugguuguaga , ccaagacuggu gcuccuaa ) , CCDC93 ( ccguauaucaccuacaaga , gauuguguccgaguaugca ) , VPS35 ( guug uuaugugcuuagua , aaauaccacuugacacuua ) , scramble ( Dharmacon ON - TARGETplus non - targeting siRNA no . 2 , catalogue number D - 001810 - 02 ) . For SNX17 rescue experiments , cells were transfected with a siRNA - resistant GFP - SNX17 or SNX17 - GFP construct 24h prior to fixation . FuGene was used for the transfection according to the manufacturer’s protocol . The siRNA - resistant constructswerecreatedbysite - directedmutagenesisandgeneratedsilentmutations in SNX17 from 1359 - CAGT - 1362 to 1359 - ATCC - 1362 . Lentiviral lines . For lentiviral production , required constructs were cloned into the pXLG3vectorandtransfectedintoHEKcellsalongwithPax2andpMDG2plasmids . Virus was harvested 72h post transfection . Virus was then filtered before titrating the virus with RPE - 1 / HeLa cells for 48h . CRISPR – Cas9 gene editing . VPS35 - , FAM21 - , SNX17 - and DSCR3 - knockout cells were generated using CRISPR – Cas9 as previously reported 39 . Integrin recycling assay and degradation kinetics . For the integrin recycling assay , control , SNX17 - or CCDC93 - knockdown cells were labelled as previously described 26 . Briefly , cells were incubated with antibody against integrin β 1 for 1h at 37 ◦ C . Cell surface antibody was then stripped ( PBS , pH 2 . 5 ) . Cells were then incubated at 37 ◦ C for the indicated time points at which cells were fixed and processedforimaging . CellsurfacelabellinginsiRNA - suppressedcellswasachieved as for SILAC - based cell surface proteomics . However , beads were not pooled and instead diﬀerent conditions were analysed separately by western blot analysis . Lysosomal degradation of α 5 β 1 was rescued through the addition of leupeptin to cells that have been transfected with siRNA for 72h , as previously described 26 . To assess α 5 β 1 integrin degradation , cells that had been incubated with siRNA oligonucleotides for 72h were then treated with 10 µ gml − 1 cycloheximide for 0 , 3 , 6 or 9h . Cells were lysed ( PBS , 1 % Triton X - 100 , protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) , pH 7 . 5 ) and protein levels were analysed by western blotting . Immunofluorescence staining . Cells were seeded onto sterile 13mm coverslips .

Coverslips were placed onto the droplets containing primary antibody in an orientation such that the cells were immersed into the liquid . Incubation for 1h at room temperature then occurred . Coverslips were then washed again with PBS three times before placing on a second droplet containing fluorophore - conjugated secondary antibody and DAPI stain diluted in 1 % BSA in PBS . Coverslips were then incubated at room temperature for 1h in the dark , to prevent quenching of the fluorophores . Following incubation , coverslips were washed three times in PBS and washed a final time in water before mounting with Fluoromount ( Sigma ) onto glass slides . Slides were left to dry overnight prior to imaging . Confocal microscopy . A Leica confocal scanning laser ( Leica SP5 ) microscope with a 63 × oil immersive objective was used to obtain confocal images of fixed cells . Cell lysis and GFP traps . Cells transfected with GFP or GFP - tagged protein constructs were lysed 48h post transfection . Dishes containing the cells were placed on ice , the medium was removed and the cells were washed three times with ice - coldPBS ( Sigma ) . Fivehundredmicrolitresor1mlimmunoprecipitationlysisbuﬀer ( 20mM Hepes pH 7 . 2 , 50mM potassium acetate , 1mM EDTA , 200mM D - sorbitol , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 × protease cocktail inhibitor , pH7 . 5 ) was added to 10cm and 15cm dishes , respectively . The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16 , 000 g for 10min at 4 ◦ C . Fifteen microlitres of GFP - trap beads ( Chromotek , catalogue number gta - 20 ) were equilibrated prior to adding cell lysate supernatants . Beads and lysates were incubated on a rocker at 4 ◦ C for 1h . Following incubation , GFP - trap beads were pelleted and the supernatant was removed . Beads were then washed by resuspending in lysis buﬀer , pelleting and removal of lysis buﬀer . This washing process was repeated three times in total . Once the final lysis buﬀer wash had been removed , beads were resuspended in 2 × NuPAGE LDS Sample Buﬀer ( Life Technologies ) , 2 . 5 % β - mercaptoethanolandboiledat95 ◦ Cfor10min . Thesamples were then suitable for SDS – PAGE and immunoblot analysis . Endogenousimmunoprecipitation . HEK293cellswerewashedwithcoldPBSprior to lysis ( 20mM Hepes pH 7 . 2 , 50mM potassium acetate , 1mM EDTA , 200mM D - sorbitol , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 × protease cocktail inhibitor , pH7 . 5 ) . Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10min at 16 , 000 g at 4 ◦ C . Lysates were then incubated with either rabbit IgG control antibody or rabbit C16orf62 / SNX17 overnight at 4 ◦ C on a roller . Two or five micrograms of antibody was used for C16orf62 or SNX17 immunoprecipitations , respectively . Pre - washed protein G beads ( GE Healthcare ) were added to the lysates and these were further incubated for 1h at 4 ◦ C on a roller . After incubation , the protein G beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 ◦ C for 30s at 1 , 500 g . The supernatant was removed and the protein G beads were washed in lysis buﬀer . This process was repeated three times . After washing , the protein G beads were resuspended in 2 × NuPAGE LDS Sample Buﬀer ( Life Technologies ) supplemented with 2 . 5 % β - mercaptoethanol and then the protein G beads were boiled at 95 ◦ C for 10min . Western blotting . NuPAGE 4 – 12 % gradient Bis - Tris pre - cast gels ( Life Technolo - gies ) wereusedtorunproteinsamples . GelswereassembledintotanksandNuPAGE MOPS running buﬀer was added . Protein samples were loaded into wells and 6 µ l of All Blue Precision Plus Protein Prestained Standard ( Bio - Rad ) was loaded as a molecular weight ladder . Gels were run at 100V until the samples had migrated to the bottom of the gel , as indicated by the Bromophenol Blue dye in the sam - ple buﬀer . Immediately after SDS – PAGE , proteins were transferred from gels to PVDF membranes for immunoblotting . PVDF membrane ( Immobilion - FL , pore size 0 . 45 µ m , Millipore , catalogue number IPFL00010 ) was activated in methanol ( Sigma ) for5min . Transferoccurredintransferbuﬀer ( 25mMTris , 192mMglycine , 10 % methanol ) at 100V for 70min . Prior to antibody incubation , membranes were subjected to a blocking stage consisting of a 1h incubation at room tem - perature with 5 % milk in TBS – TWEEN to prevent unspecific antibody binding . Primaryantibodiesweredilutedin2 % milkTBS – TWEEN , addedtothemembranes after the blocking stage and incubated at 4 ◦ C overnight . Primary antibodies were then removed and the membranes were washed with TBS – TWEEN for at least 5min , repeated three times in total . Secondary antibodies were diluted in 2 % milk TBS – TWEEN and incubated with the membranes at room temperature for 1h . Following incubation with secondary antibodies , membranes were washed once with TBS – TWEEN for 5min and then washed twice , for at least 5min each time , with 0 . 1 % SDS in TBS – TWEEN . To detect the secondary antibodies , the LI - COR Odyssey system was used . This allows detection of secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorophores 800 or 680 . Intensities of protein bands were generated using the LI - COR Odyssey software . When analysing endogenous immunoprecipitations , a mouse anti - rabbit conformation - specific antibody was incubated with the membranes in 2 % milk TBS – TWEEN for 1h at room temperature after incubation with the primary antibody and prior to the addition of an anti - mouse secondary antibody . This was donetoreducebackgroundfromtheheavyandlightchainsoftheIgGantibodyusedfortheimmunoprecipitation . All western quantification was done using the Odyssey software . In experiments where multiple gels were run for protein detection , including load controls , the quantification was done on samples processed in parallel from the same independent experiment .
