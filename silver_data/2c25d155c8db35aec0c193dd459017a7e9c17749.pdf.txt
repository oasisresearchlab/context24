RES EAR CH A RT I C LE Open Access Glycocalyx components affect platelet function , whole blood coagulation , and fibrinolysis : an in vitro study suggesting a link to trauma - induced coagulopathy Martin W . Britten 1 * , Laura Lümers 1 , Kenji Tominaga 1 , 2 , Jürgen Peters 1 and Daniel Dirkmann 1 Abstract Background : The mechanisms of trauma induced coagulopathy ( TIC ) are considered multifactorial . Amongst others , however , shedding of the endothelial glycocalyx resulting in increased concentrations of glycocalyx fragments in plasma might also play a role . Thus , we hypothesized that shedded glycocalyx components affect coagulation and may act as humoral mediators of TIC . Methods : To investigate effects of heparan sulfate , chondroitin sulfate , syndecan - 1 , versican , and thrombomodulin we added these fragments to in vitro assays of whole blood from healthy volunteers to yield concentrations observed in trauma patients . Platelet function , whole blood coagulation , and fibrinolysis were measured by standard coagulation tests , impedance aggregometry ( IA ) , and viscoelastic tests ( VET ) . To assess dose - response relationships , we performed IA with increasing concentrations of versican and VET with increasing concentrations of thrombomodulin . Results : Intrinsically activated clotting times ( i . e . , activated partial thromboplastin time and intrinsically activated VET with and without heparinase ) were unaffected by any glycocalyx fragment . Thrombomodulin , however , significantly and dose - dependently diminished fibrinolysis as assessed by VET with exogenously added rt - PA , and increased rt - PA - induced lysis Indices after 30 ( up to 108 % of control , p < 0 , 0001 ) , 45 ( up to 368 % of control , p < 0 , 0001 ) , and 60 min ( up to 950 % of control , p < 0 , 0001 ) in VET . Versican impaired platelet aggregation in response to arachidonic acid ( up to − 37 , 6 % , p < 0 , 0001 ) , ADP ( up to − 14 , 5 % , p < 0 , 0001 ) , and collagen ( up to − 31 , 8 % , p < 0 , 0001 ) in a dose - dependent manner , but did not affect TRAP - 6 induced platelet aggregation . Clotting time in extrinsically activated VET was shortened by heparan sulfate ( − 7 , 2 % , p = 0 , 024 ) , chondroitin sulfate ( − 11 , 6 % , p = 0 , 016 ) , versican ( − 13 % , p = 0 , 012 % ) , and when combined ( − 7 , 2 % , p = 0 , 007 ) . Conclusions : Glycocalyx components exert distinct inhibitory effects on platelet function , coagulation , and fibrinolysis . These data do not support a ‘ heparin - like auto - anticoagulation ’ by shed glycosaminoglycans but suggest a possible role of versican in trauma - induced thrombocytopathy and of thrombomodulin in trauma - associated impairment of endogenous fibrinolysis .

BMC Anesthesiology ( 2021 ) 21 : 83 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1186 / s12871 - 021 - 01300 - 1 Background Trauma and hemorrhagic shock are among the leading causes of death and morbidity worldwide [ 1 ] . In up to one third of trauma patients , hemorrhagic shock is complicated by trauma - induced coagulopathy ( TIC ) , an independent risk factor for mortality [ 2 ] . The etiology of TIC is considered multifactorial [ 3 ] and alterations in platelet function [ 4 ] , coagulation [ 5 ] , and fibrinolysis [ 6 ] have been suggested to play major roles . Fibrinolysis , in particular , may be massively increased , leading to hyper - fibrinolytic bleeding , or is endogenously suppressed , leading to ‘ fibrinolysis shutdown ’ . Both conditions are associated with an increased mortality [ 7 ] . At least in part , some of these alterations can be explained or are aggravated by acidosis , hypothermia , hemodilution , consumption and loss of procoagulant factors and of platelets [ 3 ] . However , the mediators leading to acquired platelet dysfunction , alterations in thrombin generation , and the frequently observed pro - or antifibrinolytic states ( hyperfibrinolysis vs . lysis shutdown ) are largely unknown . The endothelial glycocalyx layer contains various proteoglycans and glycoproteins and some of those , by binding anticoagulant mediators such as antithrombin III , heparin cofactor II , thrombomodulin , or tissue factor pathway inhibitor ( TFPI ) exert anticoagulant properties [ 8 ] . Injury to the glycocalyx , as demonstrated by increased circulating concentrations of its fragments , has been observed in trauma patients and this is associated to mortality [ 9 , 10 ] . Proteoglycans consist of a protein core with covalently linked glycosaminoglycans ( GAG ) . Even though the glycocalyx composition differs according to the type of tissue , the main GAG are heparan sulfates , chondroitin sulfates , and hyaluronan , while syndecan - 1 is among the most common proteoglycans . The latter is also one of the best - established markers of glycocalyx shedding and attains plasma concentrations of up to 477 ng / ml in trauma patients compared to median 31 . 6 ng / ml in healthy controls [ 10 ] . Heparan sulfate is increased up to 185 ng / ml in trauma patients compared to 133 . 9 ng / ml in healthy controls [ 10 ] . As hyaluronan has not been shown to be increased in trauma [ 10 ] , we did not include it in our experiments . Chondroitin sulfate has a physiological concentration of 5 . 17 μ g / ml [ 11 ] , but its concentration almost doubles in trauma patients [ 10 ] . Thrombomodulin is an endothelial protein and thrombin receptor which regulates hemostasis . Thus , its dissociation from the endo - thelium may lead to a systemic effect on coagulation and increase in its systemic concentrations is an independent predictor of trauma associated kidney failure and mortality [ 12 , 13 ] . Soluble thrombomodulin shows concentrations of up to 9 . 4 ng / ml in trauma patients [ 9 , 12 ] . Versican is a large proteoglycan and known as a critical mediator in inflammation , vascular injury , and wound healing [ 14 ] . Although it has not yet been related to trauma , its known “ versatile ” structure and functions made it logical to examine its role . While some glycosaminoglycans are only found in specific tissues , versican is found especially in vessel walls in a broad variety of tissues [ 15 ] . Therefore , even though we were unable to identify specific versican concentrations in trauma patients , it is likely to be shedded under those conditions . Accordingly , we included versican in our experiments assuming a 10 - fold increase in plasma concentrations , in analogy to syndecan - 1 . Therefore , we hypothesized that glycocalyx components such as syndecan - 1 , heparan sulfate , chondroitin sulfate , thrombomodulin , and versican may act as mediators of TIC and hence examined in vitro their individual and combined in vitro effects on platelet function , whole blood coagulation , and fibrinolysis . Methods Following approval of the local ethics committee ( Medical faculty of the University of Duisburg - Essen , Ethics Committee , no . 17 – 7772 - BO ) and written informed consent , blood ( total 39 , 8 ml , drawn via 21 g cannula , and with the first sample tube discarded to avoid contamination with thromboplastin ) from 15 healthy volunteers ( 9 male , 6 female ) , median age 34 years ( range : 27 to 41 ) was withdrawn into hirudin antic - oagulated and citrate anticoagulated test tubes ( Sarstedt , Nürnbrecht , Germany , product code 04 . 1959 . 001 for im - pedance aggregometry , 04 . 1919 for VET ) . All volunteers had an unremarkable bleeding history and denied the intake of any medication during the past weeks . Glycocalyx fragments dissolved in Phosphate Buffered Saline ( PBS ) were added to the fresh citrated blood sam - ples so as to achieve trauma - equivalent concentrations [ 10 ] . Specifically , final concentrations were 180 ng / ml for heparan sulfate ( product no . H4777 , Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , USA ) , 12 μ g / ml for chondroitin sulfate ( product no . C 9819 , Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , USA ) , 200 ng / ml for syndecan - 1 ( catalogue no . 2780 - SD , R & D Systems , Minneapolis , USA ) , and 7 ng / ml for thrombomodulin ( product no . ab98989 , Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) , respect - ively . Since we could not identify from the literature any versican concentration typical for trauma patients , we assumed ( analogous to syndecan - 1 ) a 10 - fold increase of its plasma concentration . Since plasma versican concen - trations in healthy subjects are 95 ng / ml on average , ver - sican ( product code 230 – 00833 , RayBiotech , Norcross , USA ) was added to achieve a final concentration of 950 ng / ml [ 16 ] . An additional sample was prepared using the concomitant application of all substances in their respective final concentrations outlined above . To serve as a control , another sample was prepared with phos - phate buffered saline ( PBS ) only . To avoid effects of different dilutions , the volume added to all tubes was Britten et al . BMC Anesthesiology ( 2021 ) 21 : 83 Page 2 of 10 standardized to 10 % of the total volume in all experi - mental series and assays including the control samples . Since we identified significant effects of versican and thrombomodulin on fibrinolysis resp . platelet aggrega - tion in our first series of experiments , we also assessed possible dose - dependency of these effects . Therefore , we performed a second series of experiments to yield various final concentrations of versican ( vehicle , 475 ng / ml , 950 ng / ml , and 1900 ng / ml ) and of thrombomodulin ( vehicle , 3 , 5 ng / ml , 7 ng / ml , and 14 ng / ml ) . We chose these concentrations below and above those typical for trauma patients to not only assess any dose - dependency , but also to examine effects of minor , even more commonly found concentrations . Again , blood was withdrawn and prepared from 22 healthy volunteers ( 11 male , 11 females , age : median 35 years , range 21 – 59 ) , as described above . Measurements To assess the impact of the interventions on coagulation , standard coagulation tests , viscoelastic tests ( VET ) , and impedance aggregometry ( IA ) were performed on each sample . Prothrombin time ( PT , as International Standardized Ratio , INR ) and activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) were performed according to standard proce - dures in the hospital ’ s central laboratory . VET was performed by rotational thromboelastometry and using in parallel four ROTEM® delta devices ( Werfen GmbH , Munich , Germany ) using five different assays and activators , i . e . , extrinsic activation ( EXTEM® ) with tissue factor ( TF ) , intrinsic activation ( INTEM® ) with ellagic acid , extrinsic activation with TF and abolition of platelet function using cytochalasin D so as to assess fibrin polymerization ( FIBTEM® ) , and intrinsic activation after inactivation of any heparin and hepari - noids by heparinase ( HEPTEM® ) . The latter four assays were performed according to the specifications of the manufacturer , while a second INTEM® assay was modi - fied to examine interactions of the glycocalyx fragments with fibrinolysis . Standardized tests to assess in vitro antifibrinolytic effects have not yet been established . However , previous work used extrinsically activated ro - tational thromboelastometry ( EXTEM ) with added rt - PA to address such questions [ 17 – 22 ] . As we expected heparinoid effects evoked by some of the tested glycoca - lyx components and the EXTEM - reagent contains poly - brene ( hexadimethrine bromide ) , an inhibitor of heparin , we modified this approach with an intrinsically activated test ( INTEM ) and using the same final rt - PA ( Actilyse® , Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma , Ingelheim am Rhein , Germany ) concentration of 100 ng / ml . Even though most measurements were taken almost simultaneously on up to 4 ROTEM analyzers , some samples of our first series of experiments were measured with a time delay of approximately up to 140 min . However , time effects on citrated blood samples for viscoelastic measurements are unlikely : stability of samples has been demonstrated for up to 6 h when using rotational thromboelastometry [ 23 ] . Additionally , to avoid any bias by the timing of experiments , we performed viscoelastic tests of our first series of experiments in a random order . The following ROTEM® variables were assessed : clotting time ( CT ) , clot formation time , maximum clot firmness ( MCF ) , and clot lysis index 45 min ( LI45 ) after initial clotting . All assays were run for at least 60 min after initiation of clotting ( CT ) . Impedance aggregometry ( IA ) was performed with an analogous protocol on hirudin anticoagulated blood samples . Hirudin was chosen as the anticoagulant as recommended by the manufacturer . After preparation of the assays with the glycocalyx fragments or PBS as a control , IA was performed on two impedance aggrego - metry devices ( Multiplate® Analyzer , Roche , Germany ) . Platelets were activated with arachidonic acid ( ASPIt - est® ) , adenosine - diphosphate ( ADPtest® ) , or thrombin receptor activator peptide - 6 ( TRAP - 6 ) ( TRAPtest® ) , according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Results were assessed as area under the curve ( AUC ) . For the second series of experiments , IA after activation with arachidonic acid , ADP , TRAP - 6 , and collagen ( COLt - est® ) was performed with versican in final concentrations of 475 ng / ml , 950 ng / ml , 1900 ng / ml , and vehicle . Again , VET after intrinsic activation and with addition of 100 ng / ml rt - PA to the test cups was performed with thrombomodulin in final concentrations of 3 , 5 ng / ml , 7 ng / ml , 14 ng / ml , and ve - hicle . We specifically examined clot lysis indices , represent - ing the remaining clot strength after 30 , 45 and 60 min ( LI30 , LI45 , LI60 ) to characterize the antifibrinolytic effect . Statistics Data were analyzed using Prism 6 ( Version 6 . 0b for Mac OS X , GraphPad Inc . , San Diego , USA ) . Normal distri - bution of data could not be demonstrated using a Kolmogorov – Smirnov test with the Dallal and Wilkinson approximation to Lilliefor ’ s method . Accordingly , non - parametric Friedman tests with Dunn ’ s adjustment of the α - error for multiple testing were used . Results are shown as median ( 25th / 75th percentile ) and mean percentage deviations compared to the respective controls . Results Standard laboratory tests We could not demonstrate a significant effect of any of the glycocalyx components on aPTT nor on prothrom - bin time ( INR ) ( Table 1 ) . Viscoelastic testing ( VET ) CT after intrinsic activation ( INTEM® ) was unaltered in all assays and addition of heparinase ( HEPTEM® ) did not Britten et al .

Britten et al . BMC Anesthesiology ( 2021 ) 21 : 83 Page 4 of 10 shorten CTs ( Table 1 ) . CT after extrinsic activation ( EXTEM® ) was significantly shorter with heparan sulfate ( − 7 , 2 % , p = 0 . 0244 ) , chondroitin sulfate ( − 11 , 6 % , p = 0 . 0162 ) , versican ( − 13 % , P = 0 , 0122 ) , and with their combined application ( − 7 , 2 % , p = 0 . 0068 ) ( Table 1 ) . Fibrin polymerization was unaltered , since FIBTEM® as - says did not show significant differences in clot firmness , clotting time , or lysis indices ( Table 1 ) . Fibrinolysis , as quantitatively expressed by the LI45 % , was markedly attenuated by thrombomodulin and by the combined application of all glycocalyx components when tested in intrinsically activated rotational thromboelasto - metry ( INTEM® ) with rt - PA addition ( Table 1 ) . A concentration of 7 ng / ml thrombomodulin compared to controls ( LI45 2 % ( 1 / 12 ) ) , increased LI45 by as much as 41 % ( 19 / 51 ) and the combined application of all glycoca - lyx fragments with thrombomodulin increased LI45 to 35 % ( 23 / 64 ) . The other test substances had no signifi - cant effect on LI45 ( Table 1 ) . This antifibrinolytic effect was confirmed to be dose - dependent ( Fig . 1 ) . Thrombomodulin in a concentration of 3 , 5 ng / ml increased LI30 ( 95 % compared to control 84 % , P = 0 , 0307 ) , but not LI45 or LI60 . In concentrations exceeding 7 ng / ml thrombomodulin also increased LI45 ( 73 % , compared to control 62 % , p < 0 , 0001 ) , and LI60 ( 12 % compared to control 2 % , p = 0 , 0004 ) . Impedance aggregometry ( IA ) Significant inhibition of platelet aggregation by versican and the combined application of all glycocalyx fragments was observed in response to platelet activation by ADP and arachidonic acid . Specifically , versican ( 950 ng / ml ) decreased platelet aggregation ( AUC * min ) by 17 , 9 % ( p = 0 . 0233 ) in the ADPtest and by 19 % ( p = 0 , 0458 ) in the ASPItest . The combination of all glycocalyx components decreased aggregation by 18 , 4 % ( p = 0 . 0005 ) in the ADPtest and by 18 % ( p = 0 . 0014 ) in the ASPItest , presumably due to the versican component . Platelet aggregation was unchanged by the other glycocalyx components and platelet function after TRAP - 6 activa - tion was unaltered in all tests ( Table 1 ) . The second series of experiments confirmed a dose - dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation after activation with ADP ( − 12 , 5 % , p = 0 , 0033 ) and collagen ( − 23 , 4 % , p < 0 , 0001 ) by versican concentrations exceeding 950 ng / ml and after activation with arachidonic acid ( − 19 , 7 % , p = 0 , 0218 ) by versican concentrations exceeding 475 ng / ml ( Fig . 2 ) . In line with the first experimental series , platelet function after activation with TRAP - 6 remained unaltered . Discussion The data from this in vitro study suggest a possible role for endothelial glycocalyx components as mediators in TIC since different glycocalyx fragments showed distinct dose - dependent effects on fibrinolysis , platelet function , and tissue factor - induced clotting time . Thrombomodu - lin exerted a potent antifibrinolytic effect , whereas versican significantly impaired platelet aggregation . Furthermore , several glycocalyx molecules ( i . e . , heparan sulfate , chondroitin sulfate , versican ) shortened clotting time in extrinsically activated assays . In contrast , our results do not support relevant heparin - like effects of the examined glycocalyx fragments , at least not in con - centrations commonly found in trauma patients [ 10 ] . The understanding of TIC has advanced from the so - called “ lethal triad of trauma ” , i . e . , hypothermia , acidosis , and coagulopathy , to an acute derangement of hemostatic processes . Amongst others , alterations in thrombin gener - ation , mechanical clot firmness , platelet dysfunction , and fibrinolysis have all been described [ 3 , 24 ] . However , the mechanisms contributing to these alterations have not been elucidated . Disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx both by direct and indirect damage has been reported in trauma pa - tients and traumatic “ endotheliopathy ” predicts mortality [ 12 ] . Furthermore , since the endothelial glycocalyx physio - logically regulates coagulation , glycocalyx fragments are likely to be mediators of a coagulopathy when released Fig . 1 Effects of increasing thrombomodulin - concentrations on fibrinolysis . VET with intrinsic activation and rt - PA - challenge ( 100ng / ml ) revealed increasing Lysis Indices after ( a ) 30 , ( b ) 45 , and ( c ) 60min , representing a dose - dependent antifibrinolytic effect . Means ±SD , P < 0 . 05 marked with asterisk * Britten et al . BMC Anesthesiology ( 2021 ) 21 : 83 Page 5 of 10 into the blood stream . Syndecan - 1 is among the best - established markers of glycocalyx shedding , the plasma concentrations of the latter , as well as of heparan sulfate , chondroitin sulfate and soluble thrombomodulin are considerably elevated in trauma patients [ 9 , 10 ] . Alterations of the fibrinolytic system also have an impact on mortality in trauma patients . Both , a pathologic - ally increased ( hyperfibrinolysis ) as well as a downregulated fibrinolysis ( “ fibrinolytic shutdown ” ) correlate positively with mortality in trauma patients [ 6 , 7 ] . Hyperfibrinolysis in trauma patients mainly results from shock - induced release of t - PA from endothelial cells of hypoperfused tissues , but may be aggravated by decreased concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 ( PAI - 1 ) [ 20 ] . In con - trast , the mechanisms of a downregulated endogenous fibrinolysis , commonly termed ‘ fibrinolytic shutdown ’ , are far less understood . Plasmatic alpha - 2 - macroglobuline , C1 - Inhibitor , and alpha - 2 - antiplasmin as well as platelet - derived PAI - 1 release are considered potential factors [ 25 , 26 ] . Our results suggest an additional role of soluble thrombomodulin ( sTM ) as an inhibitor of fibrinolysis in TIC , since the concentration of exogen - ously added sTM used in our assays was similar to that in trauma patients [ 12 ] . In the latter study , in - creased sTM was associated with an increased 7 - day and 28 - day mortality . As our results even show an effect for low concentrations of sTM , a major part of trauma patients may be affected by sTM - induced inhibition of fibrinolysis . Moreover , as we observed a dose - dependent effect , the sTM - concentration and its proportion to concentrations of other influencing fac - tors balancing the fibrinolytic system may contribute to the determination whether the patient will exhibit a suppressed fibrinolysis ( “ fibrinolytic shutdown ” ) or a hyperfibrinolytic state after trauma . Diminished platelet function is a risk factor for massive transfusion and mortality in severely injured patients [ 4 ] . It affects about 46 % of trauma patients leading to a state of acquired platelet dysfunction , that commonly persists for as long as 96 h [ 27 ] . Furthermore , decreased platelet func - tion , as assessed by thromboelastographic platelet mapping assays , is associated with increased fibrinolysis [ 25 ] . Recently , trauma - induced thrombocytopathy was shown to be induced by yet unknown plasmatic mediators [ 28 ] . In our study , soluble versican significantly inhibited platelet aggregation in response to ADP , arachidonic acid , and collagen in a dose - dependent manner . Thus , versican may be one of the unknown plasmatic media - tors of trauma - induced thrombocytopathy . Versican is a large proteoglycan that has been described to promote platelet adhesion and to induce platelet aggregation when associated with collagen [ 29 , 30 ] . In this respect , our results , rather indicating an anti - platelet effect of versican , seem to be somewhat contradictory . However , we speculate that circulating versican lacks its anchoring collagen structure but still interacts with platelets , thereby hindering platelet aggregation . Recently , the presence of shock rather than the degree of injury has been suggested as the common denominator resulting in the release of mediators for platelet inhibition [ 31 ] . This finding further supports our hypothesis of glycocalyx components being partly responsible for trauma - induced platelet dysfunction since shock , not injury itself , evokes endothelial disruption and hence shedding of glycocalyx components [ 32 ] . As versican dose - dependently inhib - ited platelet aggregation , a role in trauma - induced plate - let dysfunction seems suggestive . Versican did not influence platelet activation via the TRAP - 6 - pathway . However , TRAP - 6 - mediated platelet activation via the thrombin - receptor - pathway is one of the most powerful stimuli to activate platelets and it is not uncommon for drugs with established antiplatelet activity to still allow in vitro activation by TRAP - 6 . Ac - cordingly , attenuated platelet aggregation after stimula - tion with ADP , arachidonic acid , and collagen indicates a relevant inhibition of platelet function . With respect to fibrinolysis , we did not find any effects of versican induced platelet inhibition on fibrinolysis , since thromboelastometry data with exogenous rt - PA were unaffected . This finding is interesting , as decreased resistance against hyperfibrinolysis and up to the extreme of hyperfibrinolysis is a key component of TIC Fig . 2 Effects of increasing versican - concentrations on platelet aggregation , as measured by impedance aggregometry ( IA ) with platelet activation by ( a ) ADP , ( b ) arachidonic acid , ( c ) collagen , and ( d ) TRAP - 6 . Versican dose - dependently inhibits platelet aggregation in response to ADP , arachidonic acid , and collagen , but not TRAP - 6 . Means ± SD , P < 0 . 05 marked with asterisk * Britten et al . BMC Anesthesiology ( 2021 ) 21 : 83 Page 6 of 10 [ 21 , 26 , 33 ] . Platelets confer resistance to fibrinolysis by providing antifibrinolytic molecules such as plasminogen - activator - inhibitor - 1 ( PAI - 1 ) or α 2 - antiplasmin and by promoting clot firmness [ 21 , 22 , 34 ] . As we found evi - dence for versican - induced platelet dysfunction , one could therefore suspect versican to induce decreased fibrinolytic resistance . However , our experiments did not confirm such a finding , possibly due to the small extent of platelet inhibition . Versican , chondroitin sulfate , and heparan sulfate significantly shortened clotting times in extrinsically ( i . e . , tissue factor ) activated viscoelastic assays , likely reflect - ing accelerated thrombin generation . This effect of versican may be explained by inhibitory effects of the versican core protein on TFPI - 1 [ 29 ] . Moreover , we also observed shortening of the extrinsic CT after incubation with heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate . One might thus speculate , whether the core protein of heparan sul - fate shares similar properties regarding the suppression of TFPI - 1 . Nevertheless , our observation of shortened CTs are consistent with prior observations since an in - creased endogenous thrombin potential has been de - scribed in trauma patients , despite decreased plasma concentrations of prothrombin [ 35 ] . The latter authors concluded , that some kind of circulating procoagulant and decreased anticoagulant might be responsible . Our data indicate a potential role for circulating glycocalyx components as drivers for increased thrombin gener - ation , possibly by inhibition of TFPI - 1 . As the concomi - tant application of glycocalyx fragments did not result in a further shortening of clotting time , there appears to be no synergistic effect of these fragments on thrombin generation . The reason for this is unknown , but it may support the speculative inhibition of TFPI - 1 as this effect will reach its limit as soon as inhibition is complete . In case a single glycocalyx fragment in the given concentra - tion already suppresses TFPI - 1 completely , others will be unable to further increase thrombin generation . In this context , it also seems noteworthy that endogenous heparin - like anticoagulant substances , as suggested by others [ 36 ] , likely would have resulted in decreased thrombin generation . Our data question relevant heparin - like anticoagulatory effects of the glyco - calyx fragments examined along several arguments : ( 1 ) CTs of heparin sensitive , intrinsically activated assays ( i . e . , aPTT and INTEM® ) were unaffected by all frag - ments . ( 2 ) Addition of heparinase to another intrinsically activated assay ( HEPTEM® ) would have abolished any prolongation of clotting time induced by such “ hepari - noids ” , but clotting times in paired assays with and with - out heparinase did not differ significantly ( Table 1 ) . Prior in vitro studies have demonstrated prolongation of intrinsically activated CTs after incubation with heparan sulfate , dermatan sulfate , and chondroitin sulfate , and abolition of this effect by heparinase for the latter two fragments [ 36 ] . However , we used clinically relevant concentrations as reported in severely injured patients [ 10 ] , while the latter authors examined concentrations of a 50 - fold greater magnitude . Even the concomitant ap - plication of glycocalyx fragments was unable to evoke a heparin - like anticoagulatory effect , most likely because of the major difference between these concentrations . Thus , even though there may be an in vitro ‘ heparinoid ’ effect of supraphysiologic concentrations of glycocalyx fragments , our results question its clinical relevance without other influencing factors . Our study has obvious limitations . As the expected ef - fects of glycocalyx components were unknown in modal - ity and extent , we were unable to calculate an a priori power analysis before our experiments . Even though the small subject number has been sufficient in previous studies [ 18 , 19 , 37 ] , we cannot fully exclude additional minor effects , that may not have been detected under the circumstances outlined . Most importantly , by addition of glycocalyx molecules to the assays we altered only one condition in our experiments . This neglects other trauma - associated alterations , possibly rendering an already impaired coagulopathic system even more vulnerable to anticoagulatory agents . Acidosis , hemodi - lution , and hypothermia are only some examples of such a noxious environment , in which glycocalyx fragments might have different and possibly even greater effects . However , we deliberately chose to perform our experi - ments in normothermic , only 10 % diluted samples and at a physiologic pH so as to distinguish other influences on coagulation from the effects of glycocalyx fragments . Moreover , it is uncertain , whether an in vitro study fully reflects an in vivo situation . Although we performed the VET and IA in whole blood samples , this means leaving out a potential interplay with other organs or endothelial cells . It must remain speculative , whether the concentra - tions of circulating glycocalyx components and coagula - tion factors used in this study and measured in the blood stream by others [ 9 , 10 , 12 , 38 , 39 ] strictly reflect the respective conditions in localized compartments dur - ing TIC . However , even though local environments may be crucial for coagulation pathophysiology , it is almost impossible to simulate in vitro those environments with all its interactions . In fact , our in vitro findings of glyco - calyx components may even underestimate the effects in a localized compartment . Furthermore , as there is no validated in vitro whole blood test for an antifibrinolytic effect , we used a rt - PA - challenged INTEM - assay as a modification of a previously published method [ 17 – 22 ] . For interpretation of test re - sults , we minimized bias by any assay - inherent variations using randomized measurement procedures , a low coeffi - cient of variation , and a second series of experiments Britten et al . BMC Anesthesiology ( 2021 ) 21 : 83 Page 7 of 10 demonstrating a clear dose - response relationship . Even though the still non - standardized nature of the rt - PA - challenged INTEM - assay may represent a study limitation , we , therefore , consider this unlikely . The pathophysiology of trauma - induced platelet impairment is incompletely understood and , in general , platelet activation must be distinguished from platelet aggregation . Recently , trauma - induced platelet dysfunc - tion has been characterized as a malfunction of adhesion , aggregation , and contraction despite preserved flow - cytometric markers of platelet activation [ 40 ] . Therefore , we did not examine by flow cytometry plate - let surface markers of activation . Impedance aggregome - try in whole blood can be influenced by very low platelet counts in the sample [ 41 ] . Even though we used only 10 % diluted blood of healthy volunteers which usually have platelet counts above 200 / nl [ 42 ] , we cannot fully exclude a thrombopenic sample . However , asymptomatic thrombocytopenia in our healthy probands is very un - likely and we also can rule out severe thrombocytopenia since maximum clot firmness ( MCF ) in extrinsically ac - tivated rotational thromboelastometry ( EXTEM and FIB - TEM ) was not decreased . Second , as interventions were always compared to a control sample from the same vol - unteer , we doubt that even a thrombopenic volunteer would have changed results . Despite these theoretical limitations , our findings provide new data on the action of glycocalyx fragments on several features of hemostasis . Conclusions Clinically relevant concentrations of various endothelial glycocalyx components significantly affect whole blood clotting time , platelet aggregation , and fibrinolysis , suggesting a role for these molecules in the development of TIC . The most noteworthy effect was the dose - dependent inhibition of platelet function by versican and a lysis shutdown evoked by soluble thrombomodulin in concentrations commonly found in trauma patients . Accordingly , our results provide new insights into pos - sible mechanisms of TIC .
