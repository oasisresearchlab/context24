We found that treatment of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells ( HPAECs ) with the bioactive lipid , sphingosine - 1 - phosphate ( S1P ) rapidly stimulates coronin 1B translocation to lamellipodia at the cell leading edge , which is required for S1P - induced chemotaxis . Further , S1P - induced chemotaxis of HPAECs was attenuated by pretreatment with small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) targeting coronin 1B ( , 36 % ) , PLD2 ( , 45 % ) or Rac1 ( , 50 % ) compared to scrambled siRNA controls . Down regulation PLD2 expression by siRNA also attenuated S1P - induced coronin 1B translocation to the leading edge of the cell periphery while PLD1 silencing had no effect . Also , S1P - induced coronin 1B redistribution to cell periphery and chemotaxis was attenuated by inhibition of Rac1 and over - expression of dominant negative PKC d , e and f isoforms in HPAECs . These results demonstrate that S1P activation of PLD2 , PKC and Rac1 is part of the signaling cascade that regulates coronin 1B translocation to the cell periphery and the ensuing cell chemotaxis .

Introduction Sphingosine - 1 - phospahte ( S1P ) is a bioactive sphingophospho - lipid that has been shown to enhance endothelial chemotaxis during wound healing [ 1 ] . Coronin is one of the actin - regulatory proteins present at the leading edge of migrating cells [ 2 ] and has been shown to enhance cofilin - mediated actin de - polymerization [ 3 , 4 ] and inhibit Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin nucleation [ 5 ] . The idea that coronin is a critical protein for efficient cell migration is supported by the literature which reports on the presence of coronin at the leading edge of migrating cells [ 2 , 6 , 7 ] , its co - localization with other actin - regulating proteins at sites of rapid actin turnover [ 8 , 9 ] and the impaired migration of coronin mutant cells [ 10 , 11 ] . However , the detailed mechanisms of coronin - mediated cell motility are still unclear . The leading edge , or lamellipodia , of migrating cells exhibits a unique type of actin dynamics characterized by the fast ‘‘tread - milling’’ of actin filaments [ 12 ] where F - actin filaments are depolymerized at their pointed ends to liberate G - actin monomers that are recycled to extend F - actin filaments at their barbed end . Rapid actin disassembly is an important aspect of lamellipodia actin dynamics as it replenishes the G - actin monomers necessary for extending F - actin filaments . Compromise of actin depolymer - ization has been shown in cell models to reduce migration rates . Cofilin is the major actin - regulating protein involved in actin depolymerization by facilitating the removal of ADP - bound G - monomers from the pointed ends of F - actin filaments [ 13 , 14 ] . However , in the presence of G - actin monomers , cofilin is unable to depolymerize actin without coronin [ 3 ] . Although coronin has been identified as a critical cofactor for cofilin , signaling pathways regulating cofilin dephosphorylation by SSH1 and coronin relocalization to leading edges of cells are currently not well defined . Recently , the role of phospholipase D ( PLD ) in cell migration has been demonstrated [ 15 , 16 , 17 ] . PLD isoforms 1 & 2 hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , which is a second messenger and involved in membrane trafficking [ 18 ] , actin cytoskeleton remodeling [ 19 , 20 ] and cell survival [ 21 ] . Over - expression of catalytically inactive PLD2 in normal endothelial [ 15 ] and cancer cells [ 22 ] inhibited cell migration , suggesting a role for PLD in regulation of cell motility . The signaling pathways downstream of PLD leading to cell migration have not been clearly defined ; however , PA can directly activate PKC f [ 23 ] , and PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63007 PKC isoforms have been shown to be involved in cell migration in various cell types [ 15 , 24 , 25 ] . We and others have demonstrated that S1P activates PLD in endothelial and other cell types [ 26 ] ; however , the potential role of PLD in S1P - induced chemotaxis in endothelial cells is not well defined . In the present paper , we investigated the role of coronin 1B and PLD signaling in S1P - induced endothelial cell chemotaxis . Treatment of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells ( HPAECs ) with S1P rapidly induced coronin 1B localization to lamellipodia and enhanced chemotaxis . Silencing coronin 1B with small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) attenuated S1P - induced HPAEC chemotaxis . Further , PLD2 , PKC d , e and f and Rac1 signal transduction regulated S1P - mediated coronin 1B localization to lamellipodia and chemotaxis . Results Expression and Localization of Coronin 1B in Human Endothelial Cells Coronin 1B mRNA and protein are highly expressed in human pulmonary artery , umbilical vein , aortic and lung microvascular endothelial cells ( Figure 1 A & B ) . Under normal growth conditions , as evidenced by immunocytochemistry , coronin 1B co - localizes with F - actin in a , 2 m M thick region at the leading edge of the cell periphery ( Figure 2 ) . This is presumably the fast ‘‘tread - milling’’ region of F - actin polymerization that has been well - characterized for cell lamellipodia . Furthermore , a significant fraction of coronin is also diffusely distributed within the cell cytoplasm , but this population of coronin does not co - localize with F - actin or cortactin . Upon serum starvation , coronin redistributes from the cell periphery and is distributed only within the cell cytosol ( Figure 3 ) . S1P Stimulates Accumulation of Coronin 1B and Cortactin to Lamellipodia S1P is a potent angiogenic factor present in plasma at nM to m M levels [ 27 , 28 ] and an activator of endothelial signal transduction [ 29 , 30 , 31 ] . Stimulation of HPAECs with S1P ( 1 m M ) resulted in a rapid ( 2 – 30 min ) and transient accumulation of coronin 1B in membrane ruffles ( Figure 4 A ) at the leading edge of the lamellipodia ( Figure 4 B ) . In addition to coronin 1B , S1P also stimulated redistribution of cortactin to lamellipodia ( Figure 4 A and C ) . S1P Stimulated HPAEC Chemotaxis is Coronin 1B - depedent Having established that S1P stimulates redistribution of coronin1B to cell periphery , next we investigated the role of coronin1B in endothelial cell ( EC ) chemotaxis . Treatment of HPAECs with S1P induced cell chemotaxis in a Boyden chamber - based trans - well assay with increased cell transmigration observed at S1P concentrations of 0 . 1 m M and reaching a plateau at 1 m M ( Figure 5 A ) . Down - regulation of coronin 1B expression by coronin 1B small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) ( 50 nM , 72 h ) knocked down . 85 % of coronin 1B expression ( Figure 5 B ) and inhibited S1P - induced endothelial chemotaxis ( , 36 % ) and cell migration ( , 85 % ) in a wound healing assay ( Figure 5 C and D ) . This divergent result between chemotaxis and migration may be explained by inherent differences in the time frame of exposure and presentation of S1P to endothelial cells . In the chemotaxis assay , endothelial cells were allowed to migrate through a membrane filter for 6 h against a S1P gradient while in the migration assay , cells were allowed to migrate for 12 – 16 h in the presence of S1P that was added on to top of the cells . Further , S1P stimulated redistribution of coronin 1B and cortactin to lamelli - podia compared to scrambled siRNA ( Coronin 1B : = Control , 1 6 0 . 2 , S1P = 3 . 7 6 0 . 1 ; Cortactin : Control , 1 6 0 . 4 , S1P , 3 . 2 6 0 . 1 ) ; however , coronin 1B siRNA did not affect S1P - induced cortactin translocation to the lamellipodia ( Control = 1 6 0 . 4 ; S1P = 3 . 2 6 0 . 1 ; siRNA = 1 . 5 6 0 . 2 ; siRNA + S1P = 2 . 0 6 0 . 1 ) ( Figure 5 E ) . These results suggest a role for coronin 1B in S1P mediated chemotaxis of lung endothelial cells . PLD2 , but not PLD1 , Regulates S1P - induced Coronin 1B Translocation to Cell Periphery and Chemotaxis of HPAECs We have earlier demonstrated that S1P activates PLD1 and PLD2 in human bronchial epithelial cells [ 32 , 33 ] and human lung ECs [ 15 ] . To determine the role of PLD1 and PLD2 in S1P - mediated coronin 1B translocation to cell periphery , and chemotaxis , HPAECs were transfected with scrambled , PLD1 or PLD2 siRNA ( 50 nM , 48 h ) prior to S1P ( 1 m M ) treatment .

Downregulation of PLD2 , but not PLD1 , by siRNA attenuated both S1P - induced endothelial chemotaxis ( , 45 % ) ( Figure 6 B ) .

Role of Rac1 in S1P - induced Coronin 1B Distribution to Cell Periphery and Chemotaxis of HPAECs We have previously reported that PLD2 regulates S1P - induced HPAEC migration via Rac1 [ 15 ] .

S1P ( 1 m M ) stimulated the translocation of Rac1 to lamellipodia ( Figure 7 A and B ) , which was blocked by NSC23766 , an inhibitor of Rac1 [ 34 , 35 ] . Further , S1P - induced coronin 1B translocation to cell periphery and chemotaxis was also attenuated by Rac1 inhibitor NCS23766 ( Figure 7 A , B and C ) . In addition to coronin 1B , the Rac1 inhibitor also blocked S1P - mediated translocation of cortactin to cell plasma membrane ( Figure 7 A and B ) . These results suggest a role for Rac1 in S1P - induced redistribution of coronin 1B and cortactin to cell periphery as well as chemotaxis of HPAECs . Figure 4 .

HPAECs grown on glass cover slips were infected with vector control or adenoviral mPLD2 mutant K758R ( 5 MOI , 24 h ) . Over - expression of mPLD2 mutant in HPAECs attenuated S1P - induced translocation of Rac1 to lamellipodia and decreased S1P - induced association of Rac1 with coronin 1B ( Figure 8 A and B ) . These results further establish that S1P - induced coronin 1B translocation to lamellipodia is through PLD2 - Rac1 signaling cascade . Role of PKC Isoforms on S1P Mediated Chemotaxis of HPAECs After establishing a role for PLD2 and Rac1 in S1P - mediated coronin 1B redistribution to cell periphery and chemotaxis of HPAECs , next we determined the role of PKC d , e , and f isoforms in S1P - induced coronin 1B translocation to cell periphery and chemotaxis . Challenge of HPAECs with S1P ( 1 m M ) activated PKC d , e , and f isoforms [ 15 ] . To investigate the role of PKC d , e , and f isoforms on S1P - stimulated coronin 1B translocation and chemotaxis , HPAECs were infected with adenoviral vectors encoding for dominant negative ( dn ) d , e , and f ( 5 MOI ) for 24 h , which resulted in over - expression of each of the isoform protein ( , 3 – 5 fold ) ( Figure 9 A ) . Over - expression of dn PKC d , e , and f isoforms significantly reduced S1P - induced chemotaxis ( Figure 9 B ) and redistribution of coronin 1B and actin to cell periphery ( Figure 9 C , D and E ) compared to vector - infected cells and co - localization of actin and coronin 1B was quantified ( Coronin 1B and Actin Merged : Vector = 1 6 0 . 2 ; Vec - tor + S1P = 4 . 0 6 0 . 1 ; adPKC d ( Dn ) = 1 6 0 . 1 ; adPKC d ( Dn ) + S1P = 1 . 7 6 0 . 1 ; adPKC e ( Dn ) = 1 6 0 . 1 ; adPKC e ( Dn ) + S1P = 1 . 3 6 0 . 2 ; adPKC f ( Dn ) = 1 6 0 . 2 ; adPKC f ( Dn ) + S1P = 1 . 9 6 0 . 2 ) . These results establish that S1P - induced chemotaxis and coronin 1B translocation are dependent on PKC d , e , and f isoforms . Discussion Directional migration or chemotaxis of endothelial cells plays a fundamental role in many physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic development , wound healing , tissue remodel - ing , angiogenesis , and tumor metastasis [ 36 ] . Chemotaxis of ECs is mediated by growth factors , chemokines , extracellular matrix - derived molecules and bioactive lipids such as platelet activating factor , and S1P [ 37 , 38 ] . S1P mediated migration of human ECs requires activation of a v b 3 and PKC - e dependent activation of PLD2 and subsequently a PLD2 R PKC - f R Rac1 signaling cascade [ 15 ] . The data presented here reveal that coronin 1B , an actin binding protein , regulates S1P - induced EC chemotaxis . Furthermore , we show that S1P - induced translocation of coronin 1B to lamellipodia and chemotaxis is regulated by PKC d , e , and f isoforms , PLD2 and Rac1 signaling cascade . In addition , it is well established that S1P mobilizes sequestered calcium by activating G protein - coupled receptors via the PLC R PIP 2 R IP3 pathway , which induces a transient calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum followed by activation of store - operated calcium entry resulting in Ca 2 + - influx from extracellular media [ 39 ] . Thus , S1P - induced intracellular calcium changes result in cytoskeletal remodeling , enhanced chemotaxis , motility , vascular maturation and angiogenesis in ECs [ 1 , 29 , 30 ] . Chemotaxis depends upon a cell’s coordinated management of its actin cytoskeleton and is thought to occur at the leading edge of plasma membrane of the cell and the cell then pulling itself toward this leading edge [ 12 , 40 , 41 ] in response to gradient - dependent extracellular stimuli such as S1P . There is considerable evidence that S1P mediated activation of Rho GTPase family including Rho , Rac and Cdc42 are involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration [ 38 , 42 , 43 ] . Our results show that S1P treatment leads to increased localization of Rac1 and coronin 1B at the leading edge and blocking Rac1 attenuated S1P - induced coronin 1B reorganization at the leading edge and chemotaxis . S1P mediates its action via S1P 1 – 5 G - protein coupled receptors and S1P signaling via S1P 1 stimulates chemotaxis of ECs [ 44 , 45 ] . In contrast to ECs , S1P mediates chemotaxis of fibroblasts through S1P 1 , 3 or S1P 2 . In human lung fibroblasts , S1P - mediated chemotaxis was through S1P 2 [ 46 ] ; however , S1P dependent chemotaxis in human primary dermal fibroblast was dependent on S1P 1 , 3 [ 47 ] . In contrast to stimulation of chemotaxis / migration of ECs [ 15 , 48 , 49 ] , keratinocytes [ 50 ] , glioma cells [ 51 ] and fibroblast [ 46 , 47 ] , S1P inhibited migration of breast cancer cells [ 38 ] and melanoma and fibrosarcoma cells [ 52 ] . This bimodal regulation of chemotaxis / migration by S1P may be due to expression of stimulatory or inhibitory S1P receptors on different cell types , concentrations of S1P used , and coupling to varying down - stream signaling molecules . S1P stimulates PLD isoforms 1 & 2 in human lung ECs [ 15 , 26 ] and both the isoforms catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine and other phospholipids to PA . PA acts intracellularly as a second messenger [ 53 ] and PA generated via PLD signal transduction has been shown to be involved in membrane trafficking [ 54 , 55 ] , actin cytoskeleton remodeling [ 56 ] , NADPH oxidase activation [ 39 , 57 , 58 ] , cytokine secretion [ 33 ] and endothelial barrier function [ 59 , 60 ] . Further , several studies suggest a role for PLD1 and PLD2 in cell motility . Over - expression of catalytically inactive PLD2 inhibited migra - tion of ECs [ 15 ] , fibroblasts [ 61 ] and cancer cells [ 16 , 62 ] suggesting a role for PLD2 / PA signaling in regulation of cell motility . Consistent with these studies , S1P - induced migration of lung ECs was attenuated by over - expression of PLD2 ( K758R ) , but not PLD1 ( K898R ) , mutant in HPAECs [ 63 ] .

At present , the potential explanation for the differential participation of PLD1 and PLD2 is unclear but could be due to differences in the sub - cellular localization of PLD1 and PLD2 in mammalian cells . In mammalian cells , PLD1 is localized in the cytosol , Golgi membranes , nucleus and plasma membrane while PLD2 is primarily localized in the plasma membrane [ 64 , 65 , 66 ] . It is unclear how PA generated by PLD2 activation regulates coronin 1B [ 67 ] . Previously , we have shown that PLD regulates Rac1 via PKC - f and migration of HPAECs to S1P [ 15 ] ; however , mechanism ( s ) of PA - dependent activation of PKC - f is yet to be fully defined . PKC - f can be activated by acidic lipids including PA [ 68 ] but it is unclear if PKC - f has any domain structure for PA binding . Several studies have demonstrated an important role for RhoA family of GTPases , Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 in regulating cell migration in response to agonists [ 67 , 69 , 70 ] . It is well recognized that actin polymerization leading to the formation of stress fibers is RhoA - dependent [ 71 , 72 ] , a process that is partly regulated by the PLD / PA signaling axis [ 56 , 59 ] . Interestingly , PLD2 has guanine nucleotide - exchange factor ( GEF ) activity for Rho and regulates actin stress fibers in a manner independent of its lipase activity [ 73 , 74 ] . Additionally , PA activates phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phos - phate 5 kinase ( PI4P5K ) [ 75 , 76 , 77 ] to generate phosphatidylino - sitol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) , an activator of actin cytoskeleton and of interactions between actin and actin - binding proteins such as vinculin and filamin [ 78 , 79 ] . However , the role of PLD2 - generated PA in activation of Coronin 1B via PI4P5K is not known . Current evidence supports that Coronin 1B disassembles Arp2 / 3 containing actin filament branches by inducing Arp2 / 3 dissociation and alters the branch angle [ 80 ] . Phosphorylation of Coronin 1B at ser - 2 by PKC regulates its interaction with Arp2 / 3 complex and reduces phorbol ester - induced motility of fibroblast [ 81 ] . However , in vascular smooth muscle cells , phosphorylation of coronin 1B at ser - 2 was essential for PDGF - induced migration [ 82 ] . Although PDGF - induced phosphorylation of Coronin 1B reduced its interaction with Arp2 / 3 complex , an important step in inducing cell migration , the differential effect of Coronin 1B phosphorylation on cell motility mediated by phorbol ester in fibroblast and PDGF in vascular smooth muscle cells remains controversial . In lung ECs , S1P stimulated tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of Coronin 1B while phosphorylation at ser - 2 was compar - atively less to tyrosine phosphorylation ( V . Natarajan , unpublished results ) ; however the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of Coronin 1B in chemotaxis remains to be established . In conclusion , the present studies demonstrate that translocation of Coronin 1B to cell periphery participates in S1P - induced chemotaxis of HPAECs . Further , our results suggest that S1P - induced phosphorylation of Coronin 1B and redistribution to cell periphery is regulated by PLD2 , Rac1 and PKC isoforms e and f . Taken together , these observations provide new insights into role of Coronin 1B in S1P - induced regulation of chemotaxis in lung ECs ( Fig . 10 ) .

An elevated field ( 3 V at 40 , 000 Hz for 10 sec ) was applied to wound the cells on the electrode and S1P was immediately added and endothelial wound healing was monitored for 12 h by measuring the transendothelial electrical resistance . Infection of HPAECs with Adenoviral Vectors cDNA for wild type and catalytically inactive mutants of PLD1 , PLD2 , and dominant negative ( dn ) PKC d , e , and f were sub - cloned into the pShuttle - CMV vector [ 15 , 33 ] . The recombinant plasmid was linearized and transfected into HEK293 cells to generate replication - defective adenovirus . Generation of purified virus [ 10 10 plaque - forming units ( p . f . u . ) / ml ] was carried out by the University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core . Purified adenovirus ( 1 – 10 M . O .

Proposed signaling mechanisms involved in S1P - induced lamellipodial localization of Coronin 1B , Cortactin and chemotaxis of human lung endothelial cells . S1P binding to G - protein coupled S1P1 - 5 receptors activates PLD2 via PKC d and e and activation of PLD2 results in hydrolysis of membrane associated phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) to phosphatidic acid ( PA ) and phospho - choline . PA can be converted to DAG by PA - phosphatases or can activate PKC f via of phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate - 5kinase activation . Activation of PKC f results in redistribution of Coronin 1B and Cortactin to cell periphery and localization in lamellipodia of endothelial cells . PA can directly bind to and activate Rac1 and formation of actin stress fibers . Additionally , PLD2 has guanine nucleotide - exchange factor ( GEF ) activity for Rho and can regulate actin stress fibers in a manner independent of its lipase activity .
