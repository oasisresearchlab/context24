In the last ten years , an impressive body of work has been published on this topic , disseminating useful design knowledge regarding users’ preferences for ﬁnger , hand , wrist , arm , head , leg , foot , and whole - body gestures . In this paper , we deliver a systematic literature review of this large body of work by summarizing the characteristics and ﬁndings of N = 216 gesture elicitation studies subsuming 5 , 458 participants , 3 , 625 referents , and 148 , 340 elicited gestures . We highlight the descriptive , com - parative , and generative virtues of our examination to provide practitioners with an effective method to ( i ) understand how new gesture elicitation studies position in the literature ; ( ii ) compare studies from different authors ; and ( iii ) identify oppor - tunities for new research . We make our large corpus of papers accessible online as a Zotero group library at https : / / www . zotero . org / groups / 2132650 / gesture _ elicitation _ studies .

CCS Concepts • Human - centered computing → Gestural input ; User in - terface design ; Participatory design ; Empirical studies in interaction design ; INTRODUCTION Gesture elicitation studies ( GES ) were introduced in 2005 by Wobbrock et al . [ 122 ] in the form of a “guessability method , ” designed to enable the collection of end users’ preferences for symbolic input , such as for the letter - like stroke gestures of the EdgeWrite alphabet [ 124 ] . The ﬁrst application of the guessability method to hand - gesture input was conducted four years later by Wobbrock et al . [ 123 ] in the context of surface computing . Since then , GES have become a popular tool to Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for proﬁt or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the ﬁrst page .

Right : gestures produced as the combination of at least two body parts , e . g . , hand and head gestures or wrist and forearm gestures . inform the gesture user interface ( UI ) design , reﬂective of end users’ behavior and preferences , for a variety of devices [ 7 , 39 , 40 , 90 , 116 ] , applications [ 42 , 78 , 81 , 105 ] , environments [ 32 , 54 , 58 , 66 , 92 ] , and contexts of use [ 25 , 35 , 65 , 104 , 110 ] . To date , we were able to identify N = 216 such studies published in peer - reviewed journals and conferences , reporting users’ preferences for ﬁnger , hand , wrist , arm , head , leg , foot , and whole - body gestures for interactive devices , applications , and systems of all kinds ; see Figure 1 for heatmap representations . Consequently , an impressive amount of knowledge has re - sulted from the application of the GES method regarding : ( i ) the magnitude of users’ agreement over gesture com - mands they would use for interactive applications , ( ii ) con - sensus gesture sets , ( iii ) design guidelines and recommen - dations [ 4 , 59 ] , ( iv ) software tools [ 2 , 3 , 61 , 76 , 102 ] , and ( v ) methodological variations and improvements of the original GES method [ 71 , 109 , 113 – 115 ] . However , while the com - munity has been busy accumulating design knowledge re - garding new types of gestures [ 21 , 28 , 110 ] or high - consensus gesture commands for new prototype devices [ 104 , 116 , 121 ] and new environments [ 17 , 24 , 30 , 32 , 54 , 95 ] , the result was an ever - growing list of GES scattered through the various dissem - ination venues of the HCI scientiﬁc literature . In this context , it is high time to systematize all this knowledge in a rigorous way for the community to be able to identify best practices and Folding , Printing and Exploring Tangible Interactions DIS ’20 , July 6 – 10 , 2020 , Eindhoven , Netherlands 855 use them effectively to advance scientiﬁc discovery in end - user gesture elicitation as well as the capacity to transfer results into actual user interfaces and applications . In this work , we analyze the body of work on gesture elicita - tion in the form of a systematic literature review ( SLR ) . The SLR method [ 12 , 49 , 56 ] is radically different from conducting a survey or from free - form discussion of related literature in that it follows a rigorous , well - deﬁned procedure guaran - teed to produce reliable , reproducible results . Moreover , we adopt the generic principles of “designing interactions , not interfaces” [ 8 ] , which we distill into three virtues of our SLR : V 1 . The descriptive virtue : our SLR provides practitioners with a method to describe the underlying characteristics of any GES , including new studies to be published in the future and , thus , position them precisely in the literature . For instance , a practitioner may be interested in forming a clear understanding of the design and results of some new GES addressing gestures for smart rings [ 39 ] , for which clear dimensions of analysis are needed . The correspond - ing research questions addressed by the descriptive virtue of our SLR with respect to some GES are : What are the main meta - data of such GES ? , What is the scope of the study ? , and How were the results reported and analyzed ? V 2 . The comparative virtue : our SLR enables a method to compare GES from different authors . In our previous example , the practitioner may come across different GES for smart rings . By clearly describing those studies along various dimensions , the practitioner will be able to assess their overlapping degree , similarities , and key differences . The corresponding research questions for this virtue are : In what ways are two or more GES similar ? , How can one identify similar GES studies ? , and Which studies relate to a speciﬁc topic ? V 3 . The generative virtue : our SLR makes it possible to iden - tify areas of investigation in end - user gesture elicitation that were not covered or have been little explored by pre - vious work . For example , after comparing previous work on gesture elicitation for smart rings , the practitioner should be able to identify new investigative opportuni - ties . The corresponding research questions are : Which areas require new or more GES ? and Which areas need veriﬁcation , validation , or consolidation ? The contributions of this paper are as follows : C 1 . We conduct the ﬁrst systematic literature review on ges - ture elicitation , for which we examine , characterize , and compare N = 216 published , peer - reviewed studies . To this end , we introduce a detailed research method to guide our systematic literature review . We report ﬁndings from 5 , 458 participants , who were elicited for 3 , 625 referents , and proposed 148 , 340 gestures in response . C 2 . We focus on the descriptive , comparative , and generative virtues of our examination to provide the community with an effective method to ( i ) understand how current and new GES position in the literature ; ( ii ) compare GES pub - lished by different authors ; and ( iii ) identify opportunities for unexplored areas in gesture elicitation or areas in need of knowledge validation . SURVEYS OF GESTURE ELICITATION STUDIES A few papers discussed the literature on GES , but are all lim - ited in their scope . For example , Vuletic et al . [ 107 ] conducted a SLR on hand gestures for user interfaces and mentioned the GES method , but GES were not the main goal of their investigation . Software tools for gesture elicitation were also surveyed [ 61 ] , but with a focus on features and software qual - ities from the perspective of engineering interactive comput - ing systems . The work closest to ours is Vogiatzidakis and Koutsabasis [ 118 ] , who discussed GES for mid - air interaction , and analyzed a corpus of N = 47 papers . While an impressive effort , their scope was limited to mid - air gestures only ; in contrast , our examination addresses the entire GES literature , representing a scope ﬁve times larger ( N = 216 ) . CONCEPTS AND TERMINOLOGY We present an example of a GES study to illustrate the princi - ples of the method and summarize the main concepts . Illustrative Example of a Gesture Elicitation Study Imagine a designer that wishes to implement a gesture UI for a new smart ring prototype to enable users to control the lights of a smart home environment with commands such as turn lights on and off , dim lights , and make lights brighter . The designer assembles a group of potential users P , perhaps 20 in number , i . e . , | P | = 20 , to participate in a study . Each participant is presented with the effect of each function , e . g . , the intensity of the lights is increased for the “make lights brighter” function , and the participant is asked to propose a gesture command using the smart ring that would generate the effect just witnessed . At the end of the study , the designer has collected a set of 80 gestures = 4 ( functions ) × 20 ( proposals ) . The designer now looks at the set of gestures elicited for each function to understand whether there are any gestures in agreement . If agreement turns out substantial and the sample of participants is representative of the population of end - users targeted by the smart ring application , then the designer can be conﬁdent that the elicited gestures are intuitive , and new users , not part of the original study , will likely guess , easily learn , and perhaps prefer the same types of gestures . Glossary of Concepts and Terminology We provide below an alphabetically ordered list of deﬁnitions for the concepts and terminology employed in GES . Agreement : The situation in which the gestures of two or more participants are evaluated as identical or similar according to a set of rules , criteria , or similarity function and , thus , equivalent from the perspective of the target application . Example : The designer may consider that gesture direction and speed are more important than the amplitude of the ﬁnger movement , since the smart ring embeds an accelerometer , but not a sensor for measuring absolute position in space . Measure of agreement : A numerical measure quantifying the magnitude of agreement among the gestures elicited from par - ticipants . Example : From the 20 participants of the study , three subgroups of sizes 9 , 7 , and 5 emerge for the “dim lights” referent , so that all the participants from each sub - group are in agreement . The agreement score [ 122 ] com - putes ( 9 / 20 ) 2 + ( 7 / 20 ) 2 + ( 5 / 20 ) 2 = . 388 , and the agreement rate [ 114 ] returns ( 9 · 8 + 7 · 6 + 5 · 4 ) / ( 20 · 19 ) = . 353 . Folding , Printing and Exploring Tangible Interactions DIS ’20 , July 6 – 10 , 2020 , Eindhoven , Netherlands 856 Agreement score / rate : Various measures of agreement have been referred to as a “score” [ 122 ] or a “rate” [ 114 ] . Command : A signal that actuates the execution of a function in the user interface . Also referred to as a “gesture command , ” where the signal is represented by gesture input . Example : In response to the “dim lights” referent , a participant may propose a downwards movement of the ﬁnger . Consensus rate : A measure of agreement [ 113 ] that employs dissimilarity functions and tolerances . Consensus gesture set : The set of gestures that reached the largest agreement for the referents examined in the study . Ex - ample : Say that 11 participants believe that a downwards movement of the ﬁnger is best to effect “dim lights” ; 9 par - ticipants consider than an upwards movement should effect “make lights brigher” ; and 15 participants propose clockwise and counter - clockwise circle movements to turn the lights on an off . In that case , the consensus gesture set is composed of the downwards , upwards , clockwise , and counter - clockwise gestures of the ﬁnger wearing the smart ring . Dissimilarity function : A numerical function that computes a real , positive value reﬂecting how dissimilar two gestures are [ 113 ] . Example : If the designer collects gestures numeri - cally , e . g . , as a set of linear acceleration points , the Euclidean distance or the Dynamic Time Warping functions [ 112 ] could be used to automate the evaluation of agreement measures . Elicitation : The process of making participants respond to referents and propose gestures to effect those referents . End user : A potential user of the interactive device , applica - tion , or system for which gestures are designed ; a sample of end users forms the “participants” of the GES . Function : A feature of the user interface that can be con - trolled independently using a command ; the same as “referent . ” Example : make lights brighter . Gesture : A movement of a part of or the whole body per - formed in response to a referent . Referent : A feature of the user interface that can be controlled independently using a command ; the same as “function . ” Ex - ample : make lights brighter . Symbol : Any artifact that evokes a referent in the form of a computer function , e . g . , stroke gestures , surface gestures , mid - air gestures , command keywords , voice commands , icons , button labels , menu items . Synonym : sign . Participant : A subject , representative of the population of end users , that volunteered to participate in the GES . RESEARCH METHOD We outline our method for conducting the SLR , which we organized as a four - phase ﬂow procedure consisting of Identi - ﬁcation , Screening , Eligibility , and Inclusion phases , inspired by the approach of Liberati et al . [ 56 ] . We took speciﬁc care to implement each phase , so that our results could be readily re - produced . Fig . 2 shows an overview of our method represented in the form of a PRISMA 1 diagram [ 56 ] . 1 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta - Analyses . 1 , 819 papers identified through database searching ( ACM MD = 112 , ACM FT = 400 , IEEE = 507 , Springer Link = 400 , Science Direct = 400 ) 430 additional papers identified through other sources ( DBLP = 25 , Google Scholar = 405 ) N = 216 papers included I d e n t i f i c a t i o n S c r ee n i n g E l i g i b ili t y I n c l u s i o n 311 duplicate papers removed ( ACM MD = 2 , ACM FT = 151 , DBLP = 21 , Google Scholar = 137 ) 1 , 938 papers screened after duplicates removed 1 , 640 irrelevant papers removed ( ACM MD = 20 , ACM FT = 181 , IEEE = 499 , Springer Link = 352 , Science Direct = 394 , DBLP = 3 , Google Scholar = 191 ) n = 2 , 249 papers identified in total 298 papers eligible 82 papers excluded ( ACM MD = 2 , ACM FT = 17 , Springer Link = 18 , Google Scholar = 45 ) Quantitative analysis ( Zotero ) Qualitative analysis ( Classification ) Figure 2 . The four - phase ﬂow diagram of our SLR examination . Phase 1 : Identiﬁcation We searched for papers potentially relevant to our topic of investigation using the following query : Q = ( “Gesture” AND “Elicitation” AND “Study” ) which we ran on both single - publisher libraries ( e . g . , IEEE Xplore ) and multi - publisher engines ( e . g . , Google Scholar ) . We selected the following ﬁve major Computer Science dig - ital libraries : ( 1 ) ACM DL 2 ; ( 2 ) IEEE Xplore 3 ; ( 3 ) Elsevier ScienceDirect 4 ; ( 4 ) Elsevier Ei Compendex ( also referred to as Engineering Village 5 ) ; and ( 5 ) SpringerLink . 6 We also used two multi - publisher sources to ensure the completeness and coherence of the GES references , validate independent query results , and cover other publishers as well : ( 6 ) DBLP CompleteSearch 7 and ( 7 ) Google Scholar . 8 These two engines were employed more as a veriﬁcation mechanism than for reference identiﬁcation purposes . To ensure the stability and constancy of our queries , we down - loaded all the resources during one week . First , the list of references was compiled in one day ( August 15 , 2019 ) , which we set as the last day for considering GES in our SLR . Individ - ual papers were then progressively retrieved from the digital libraries over several subsequent days ( until August 21 , 2019 ) to avoid excessive requests that might forbid our authorized 2 https : / / dlnext . acm . org 3 http : / / ieeexplore . ieee . org / 4 http : / / www . sciencedirect . com / 5 https : / / www . elsevier . com / solutions / engineering - village / 6 http : / / www . springerlinks . com 7 http : / / www . dblp . org / search / 8 http : / / scholar . google . com / Folding , Printing and Exploring Tangible Interactions DIS ’20 , July 6 – 10 , 2020 , Eindhoven , Netherlands 857 access to those libraries . The results of each query Q were retained according to the following rules : 1 . The “advanced search” rule . Queries were run using the most advanced search feature of the digital libraries , and results were sorted in decreasing order of their relevance . 2 . The “minimum number of references” rule . If the query returned a small number of references ( less than 400 ) , all those references were automatically retained . 3 . The “no missing references” rule . If the query returned more than 400 references , the ﬁrst 400 were automatically selected for further screening , and a manual check of the next 200 references was performed to make sure no relevant papers were discarded . Table 1 shows the results of executing query Q for each source of references . For example , the ACM DL returned a number of 2 , 859 references in full - text search mode , of which 400 were retained ; from those , 151 duplicates were identiﬁed when com - paring against the results of other queries , and 198 references were excluded based on further screening criteria ( see next ) , leaving 51 papers ; see the second row of Table 1 . Overall , our queries identiﬁed 1 , 938 references across all seven sources . Phase 2 : Screening Each paper was evaluated with respect to its relevance to GES using criteria of form and contents , as follows : Form . We retained only papers written in English that under - went a peer - review process , and for which the full text and the resulting gesture set was available . These included research pa - pers published in peer - reviewed journals , conferences , sympo - siums , workshops , and excluded unreviewed references where the full gesture set was not published or accessible , such as patent descriptions , standards , extended abstracts , slideshows . PhD and Master theses were not considered , although they could in a future version . Contents . We retained only those papers that ( 1 ) explicitly introduced a GES for UI design ; or ( 2 ) discussed GES , emphasizing at least one discriminating feature ( e . g . , , scale [ 80 ] , memorability [ 73 ] , etc . ) ; or ( 3 ) ex - plicitly used a method to examine GES . A number of 1 , 640 irrelevant references were excluded by our screening , leaving 1 , 938 - 1 , 640 = 298 papers . Phase 3 : Eligibility We considered ineligible and further excluded those papers that matched any of the following situations : ( 1 ) independent research question : the paper explicitly mentioned a GES , but did not report its results , or the goal of the GES was not gesture UI design , e . g . , Yin and Davis [ 127 ] conducted a GES to collect data for training a gesture recognizer ; ( 2 ) methodology - oriented : the paper addressed methodological aspects of GES , but did not report an actual study , e . g . , Morris et al . [ 71 ] discussed legacy bias for gesture elicitation ; or ( 3 ) ﬁeld mismatch : the paper reported an actual elicitation study , but for another discipline , e . g . , a GES conducted to elicit user - deﬁned gestures to train a robot . By using these rules , we further removed 82 papers , leaving a ﬁnal corpus of N = 216 studies for our examination . Phase 4 : Inclusion This phase consisted in verifying quantitative and qualitative aspects of our corpus of papers , as follows . y = 3 . 8909x - 4 . 1636 R² = 0 . 9052 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 20092010201120122013201420152016201720182019 N u m b e r o f s t ud i e s Year of publication 13 38 58 39 31 20 4 3 3 1 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of authors Figure 3 . Number of authors per paper ( a ) , over time ( b ) . Quantitative analysis . We employed the following tools to create a collection of papers and generate summary statistics : 1 . Zotero , 9 a multi - platform bibliography management soft - ware tool use for managing our corpus publicly avail - able at https : / / www . zotero . org / groups / 2132650 / gesture _ elicitation _ studies . 2 . PaperMachines , 10 a Zotero extension for visualizations . 3 . PDF2Text , 11 software for automatic extraction of text from PDF ﬁles . The extracted text was submitted to automatic language processing and analysis . Qualitative analysis . The list of N = 216 references was ex - ported from Zotero into a spreadsheet , and qualitative classiﬁ - cations of each GES were manually performed with regards to various dimensions of analysis , e . g . , , number of participants , measures of agreement , etc . ; see next section for details . An inter - judge agreement procedure was employed for this , as follows . Two HCI researchers , with 5 and 20 years of experi - ence , respectively , and who were both authors of this paper , independently classiﬁed each paper based on the set of criteria . In case of disagreement , a third researcher with 9 years of experience , who was not an author of this paper , arbitrated a discussion between the ﬁrst two researchers until consensus was reached . RESULTS : DESCRIPTIVE VIRTUE We present in this section an overview of the characteristics of published GES according to various dimensions of analy - sis , such as the number of participants involved , the types of gestures addressed , any complementary input modalities , and more . We seek to understand the audience of GES by looking where those studies were published and which studies have been most inﬂuential . Authors , Venues , and Hot Topics in Gesture Elicitation Figure 3b shows the number of GES conducted between 2009 , the year when the ﬁrst hand - gesture elicitation paper of Wob - brock et al . [ 123 ] was published , and 2019 . The increasing number of studies ( we found a linear regression with R 2 = . 90 ) suggests that the peak of GES has not been reached yet . Fig - ure 3a highlights the number of authors involved in conducting and reporting GES . While a typical GES paper has three au - thors ( 60 studies , representing 27 . 8 % ) , a number of studies were conducted by single authors [ 46 , 64 , 111 ] , while others by up to eight [ 53 , 78 ] , nine [ 4 , 74 ] , or even ten authors [ 101 ] , when multiple classiﬁcation criteria or domains of expertise were needed [ 20 , 74 ] . 9 http : / / www . zotero . org / 10 http : / / www . papermachines . org / 11 http : / / www . pdf2text . com / Folding , Printing and Exploring Tangible Interactions DIS ’20 , July 6 – 10 , 2020 , Eindhoven , Netherlands 858 Source Query Rules Duplicates Excluded Included References 1 .

Distribution of GES in the literature . In terms of dissemination venues , Table 2 lists conferences and journals where GES have been published , with confer - ences taking a major lead ( 79 % ) . Of these , CHI ( 38 papers ) , ITS ( 10 ) , MobileHCI ( 9 ) , and DIS ( 8 papers ) had the highest number of GES . Journal articles account for 21 % of all pub - lished GES , but no clear preferences can be identiﬁed . The variety of dissemination venues shows a body of gesture de - sign knowledge that is scattered through the literature of HCI and , in some cases , of other disciplines , which is challenging for practitioners to locate speciﬁc information . Table 3 lists the twelve most inﬂuential GES in decreasing order of their Google Scholar number of citations ( from Au - gust 15 , 2019 ) . The hot topics that received most citations are directly proportional to the importance , the diffusion , or the novelty of the device studied : tabletops [ 38 , 72 , 73 , 122 , 123 ] , smartphones and tablets [ 47 , 90 ] , smart TVs and smart homes [ 51 , 111 ] , augmented reality [ 81 ] , and shape - changing interfaces [ 53 ] or a drone [ 17 ] , two emerging ﬁelds . The consideration of other categories of users than able - bodied adults , along with the analysis of its inﬂuence , appeared for blind participants [ 47 ] , who analyzed the trade - off between the users’ preference and the system’s performance . Memorabil - ity [ 73 ] demonstrates the superiority of user - deﬁned gestures over designer - deﬁned or system - deﬁned gestures with with respect to preference and recall rate . The body of GES knowl - edge counts for 5 , 907 citations with 856 citations per year on average . Participants Figure 4 presents a detailed overview of the number of GES in relation to the number of participants involved ( vertical axis ) and over time ( horizontal axis ) 12 . We found that the average number of participants was M = 25 ( SD = 4 ) , and the most frequent choice was 20 participants , a sample size that was adopted by 36 % of the studies . This preference is likely explained by the fact that Wobbrock et al . [ 123 ] employed 20 participants in their original gesture elicitation study . Starting from this value , we highlighted three regions in Figure 4 : ( 1 ) the “green” region , where the number of participants is at least 20 ( 51 % ) ; ( 2 ) the “yellow” region with less than 20 participants , but above 10 ( 38 % ) ; ( 3 ) and the “orange” region , with studies reporting results from a small number of participants , less than 10 ( 11 % ) . Note , however , that a small sample size is justiﬁable in some cases , such as when the study examines end - users from populations that are more challenging to access , such as users with im - pairments , or populations of users under - represented , such as small children . Large sample sizes were employed in studies interested in cultural aspects [ 74 ] , such as 340 participants to test culturally - aware touch gestures [ 65 ] or 227 participants involved in framed guessability for multiple devices [ 14 ] ) . We also analyzed the ratio Male / Female 13 and found an av - erage of 2 . 10 ( SD = 2 . 18 , Mdn = 1 . 13 ) . Most of the studies ( 52 % ) involved more male than female participants ; a parity of gender was found in 15 % of the studies , and 17 % studies had more female than males . A gender bias is clear from these ﬁgures , probably due to availability or volunteering aspects . 12 Years were omitted when GES were absent . Four studies did not report their sample size and , thus , N = 212 for this report . 13 For the 183 GES studies that reported this information .

Number of participants by age groups involved over time . 202 GES ( 93 . 5 % ) reported the age of the participants . Mean age was 27 . 57 years ( SD = 14 . 62 , Mdn = 23 . 4 ) . Seven studies ( 3 % ) addressed children , 4 studies ( 2 % ) teenagers , and the vast majority of GES studies focused on adults ( 93 % ) , of which 4 ( 2 % ) addressed older adults . Often , the background or the level of experience with technology is missing . Body Parts Addressed by Gesture Elicitation We found that some GES focused on speciﬁc body parts ( e . g . , legs [ 99 ] ) or combinations of body parts [ 78 ] , while other studies examined gestures performed by the whole body [ 21 ] . From this perspective , we can identify a range of investigations that start from a speciﬁc body part and progress to the whole body , which we refer to as the “human gesture continuum . ” We consider this continuum as a structured mechanism , whereby gestures performed by the human body can be uniquely ref - erenced . For instance , gestures performed with upper - body limbs can be decomposed into the various body parts that were involved in the production of the gesture , such as the face [ 89 , 93 , 99 ] , head [ 28 , 99 , 120 ] , head and shoulders [ 110 ] , eyes [ 62 ] , nose [ 87 ] , mouth [ 27 ] , shoulders [ 87 ] , torso [ 99 ] , and even belly gestures on the abdomen [ 117 ] . The arms are themselves subject to a gesture continuum : ﬁngers [ 18 ] , wrist [ 91 ] , wrist and hand gestures [ 48 ] , hands [ 5 , 37 , 82 , 116 ] , forearm [ 52 , 91 ] , arms [ 57 ] , and skin - based gestures [ 44 ] . In terms of gestures produced by lower - body parts , we identiﬁed foot gestures [ 1 , 33 , 34 ] , legs [ 98 , 99 ] , and whole - body ges - tures [ 21 , 23 ] . To understand the coverage of body parts in the GES literature , we computed two measures : 1 . The Individual Frequency of Body Parts ( IFBP ) , showing often a part of the body , such as the hand [ 81 ] or head [ 28 ] , was employed in a GES study . 2 . The Combination Frequency of Body Parts ( CFBP ) of body parts , reporting how often speciﬁc body parts were com - bined , such as head and hand gestures [ 20 ] . The ﬁrst measure reports on the importance of individual body parts , while the second on their combinations , including ges - tures performed at the level of the entire human body . Figure 1 illustrates individual frequency values in the form of a heatmap directly on the human body , while the com - bination frequency is shown as colored outline of various body parts , e . g . , feet are shown in yellow while the out - line of the human body is shown in dark orange . We found a number of 380 occurrences of individual body parts , of which 241 were combined . The most frequent gestures were distributed as follows : ﬁnger ( 144 / 380 = 38 % ; 39 / 241 = 16 % ) , hand ( 139 / 380 = 37 % ; 28 / 241 = 12 % ) , arm ( 35 / 380 = 9 % ; 1 / 241 < 1 % ) , body ( 30 / 380 = 8 % ; 30 / 241 = 13 % ) , wrist ( 8 / 380 = 2 % ; 8 / 241 = 3 % ) , voice ( 7 / 380 = 2 % ; 7 / 241 = 3 % ) , head ( 5 / 380 = 1 % ; 5 / 241 = 2 % ) . Face , feet , shoulders , torso , or skin represent each 1 % or less . However , hand and ﬁngers are covered by 77 / 241 = 32 % of combinations , followed by arm + hand + ﬁngers ( 28 / 241 = 12 % ) , and arm + hand ( 6 / 241 = 2 % ) . Referents The average number of referents was M = 20 . 10 ( Mdn = 22 . 03 ) with a wide variance ( SD = 5 . 23 ) indicating that the num - ber of referents varies from a few ( Min = 1 [ 85 ] ) to many ( Max = 70 [ 125 ] ) . Referents have been presented to partic - ipants graphically using images ( most of the time ) , animations , videos , UI prototypes , either mock - ups or functional . This ﬁnding concurs with a study identifying the most frequent and efﬁcient representations of referents [ 67 ] . Referents are often decided according to standard sets of categories [ 116 , 128 ] : basic functions ( e . g . , TV on / off , Next / previous channel , Vol - ume Up / down / mute , Open / Hide menu , and Open / Close item ) , generic functions ( or context - independent : e . g . , Select simple choice , Select multiple choice , Select a date , Specify a num - ber , an angle ) , and speciﬁc functions ( or context - dependent : e . g . , TV Guide , Play / pause ) . Functions are described as be - ing either analogue ( when they induce a physical effect of real world , such as move , select , rotate , shrink , enlarge , pan , zoom / out , previous , next , maximize , and minimize ) or ab - stract ( when no physical effect of real world is induced , such as insert , delete , modify , cut , duplicate , paste , undo , menu access , and open . Folding , Printing and Exploring Tangible Interactions DIS ’20 , July 6 – 10 , 2020 , Eindhoven , Netherlands 860 Gesture Datasets The average number of elicited gestures across all studies was M = 716 ( SD = 1438 , Mdn = 375 ) with a minimum of 4 ges - tures [ 129 ] and a maximum of 12 , 240 [ 96 , 97 ] . After grouping gestures into clusters of identical or similar types , the average number of reported gestures was M = 91 ( SD = 231 , Mdn = 24 ) . Of these , an average of C = 21 were selected to form consensus gestures sets . Often , C is smaller than the number of referents , since one gesture may be assigned to more than one referent 14 . Other Input Modalities Besides gestures , other modalities have been elicited , either independently or in combination with gesture input , such as menu shortcuts [ 13 ] , function keys [ 7 ] , voice commands [ 55 , 70 ] , multi - device commands [ 6 ] , and multimodal input [ 75 ] . In particular , the “Web on the Wall” study of Morris [ 70 ] elicited both gesture and voice commands , and was reproduced with multimodal commands [ 75 ] . Analysis The most frequently reported measures of agreement have been : the agreement score A [ 122 ] ( 34 % ) , the agreement rate AR [ 114 ] ( 51 % ) , the maximum consensus [ 70 ] ( 5 % ) , the con - sensus rate [ 70 ] ( 3 % ) , the frequency of proposed gestures [ 89 ] ( 2 % ) , and others ( less than 5 % ) . Most studies did not specify whether the measures were computed manually or automati - cally from a gesture set ( e . g . , using tools such as AGaTE [ 114 ] or via spreadsheet calculations [ 110 ] ) . Other measures have been reported besides agreement , such as : Goodness - of - Fit , a subjective assessment rating the partici - pants’ conﬁdence about how well the elicited gesture ﬁt the ref - erents [ 51 , 123 ] ; Memorability , a recall rate of a gesture some time after it has been elicited [ 73 ] , Ease - of - Execution , a sub - jective assessment expressing the participant’s perception of the ease of producing physically a gesture elicited [ 123 , 128 ] ; Ease - of - Conception , a rating of how it is easy to come up with this gesture elicited for a referent [ 77 ] ; Enjoyability , same for the subjective perception of playfulness [ 28 ] , and validation through an identiﬁcation study , which reverses an elicitation study by showing a new set of participants elicited gestures and asks them for the referent they think those gestures effect [ 3 ] . RESULTS : COMPARATIVE VIRTUE All the words contained in the metadata of each paper , such as in their title , abstract , internal and external keywords , and all the terms contained in their corresponding PDF papers were extracted 11 ) to feed a database of indexed keywords and tags . A visualization tool 15 exploits this database to produce several graphics and to browse the corpus along several structural di - mensions , such as year , venue ( e . g . , CHI , DIS , ITS ) , keyword ( e . g . , agreement ) , type of gesture ( e . g . , hand , motion gestures ) . To determine important terms in the corpus , we built a Word Cloud based on Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency 14 In the original method [ 122 ] , if the same gesture is being used for multiple referents , then a conﬂict resolution process assigns the gesture with the most agreement to its referent and the next referent receives its second - most agreement gesture . Many studies did not invoke this step , although it was part of the original procedure . 15 See supplemental material for these outputs and for more details . ( TF - IDF ) , the most frequently applied weighting scheme in recommender systems [ 9 ] . Besides common terms found in this cloud ( e . g . , gesture , participant , elicitation ) , other terms suggest that GES are indeed intended to design gestures for in - teraction , then to train a gesture recognizer afterwards ( though not much covered ) , but not to consolidate gestures into a database . The most frequent terms cover either a device type ( e . g . , table , TV ) or a gesture class ( e . g . , mobile , motion , mid - air gestures ) , or some limb ( e . g . , hand , body , ﬁnger ) . However , they do not denote the labelling or the deﬁnition of individual gestures ( e . g . , Swipe is the only one standing out ) neither do they refer to a precise context of use . No common deﬁnition of referents stands out . To better understand how these terms evolve over time , we computed a chronological tag cloud for every year from the ﬁrst GES identiﬁed [ 84 ] until the last one [ 63 ] based on Dun - ning’s method [ 29 ] . In the beginning , GES were mostly fo - cused an applying image processing to handle gestures , but they progressively switched to other capture ( like raw data , video , manual recordings ) . Head and deictic gestures were the ﬁrst considered around 2005 , then surface gestures from 2009 . From that time , full - body gestures appeared as well as the ﬁrst decyphering schemes ( e . g . , [ 69 , 77 , 81 ] ) to systematically classify gestures . Motion gestures appeared in 2010 , as well as the ﬁrst considerations of various categories of user ( e . g . , sighted vs blind users ) , but these categories remained basic . Physical aspects related to multi - touch gestures in a smart en - vironment were signiﬁcantly considered in 2011 with different devices , but not really in a real context . The focus has been primarily put on the evolution of devices ( e . g . , steering wheel in 2013 , deformable displays in 2014 , tangible interaction in 2015 , wristwatch in 2018 ) , then on participant categories ( e . g . , different ages in 2016 , visually impaired people in 2017 ) . The most emerging topics in 2019 concern the disagreement problem , the more profound consideration of different age groups ( not just adults ) , public and social aspects , also raising the need to better analyze data sources and to use them in the rest of the development life cycle . This evolution is also revealed in a topic modelling based on a Sankey diagram [ 88 ] automatically generated from the GES contents : topics are sorted by most common , most coherent , and most variable , and can be presented as a stream , a stacked bar , a line graph , or a categorical histogram . Any stream can then be explored to list GES satisfying the criteria selected and papers can be further explored . In particu - lar , the ﬂow representing the new gesture sets in new contexts of use , necessarily promoted by the most recent devices , is maintained over time . The interest for other topics , like ﬁnger - based gestures , classiﬁcation schemes , and semantic aspects is decreasing to its minimum . TAKEAWAYS : GENERATIVE VIRTUE If the constraints imposed on the initial GES characterization are relaxed , then this characterization can be generalized to raise new ways of conducting and interpreting a GES , some of which have been partially explored , some others are left to be investigated . As takeaways , this section suggests several new lines for conducting a GES .

Suggestions for imaginary setups not covered in the SLR : with haptic modality ( a ) , within a UI prototyping environment ( b : by stroke gesture , c : by mid - air gesture ) , for cross - device interaction ( d : touch gesture on the source platform followed by , e : mid - air gesture on the target platform . Eliciting other symbols than gestures , other modalities Most GES reviewed produce gestures only . Other symbols could be elicited as well , such as a command with parameters , menu items along with their mnemonic , shortcut , or function key , a function performed with one or many modalities ( e . g . , graphical , vocal , tactile , haptic ) . For example , Fig . 5a relies on a physical grid with plots to elicit haptic feedback from a ultra - haptic device . Among the ﬁve primary human senses , vision and audition are covered much more than tactition , gustation , and olfaction , probably because our human brain ﬁlters signals so that the visual , auditory , and tactile channels respectively occupy 80 % , 10 % , and 5 % of the total bandwidth , thus leaving less space for others . Beyond these senses , secondary senses , such as thermoception ( heat ) , nociception ( pain ) , or equilibri - oception ( balance ) could also serve for eliciting new ranges of symbols . In these cases , the symbol should be captured easily in a cost - effective way , such as by a device , a video or any other recording system . Symbols are also ideally captured nu - merically , that is , they can be compared computationally . For a monomodal symbol , the modality conditions the recording system . Gestures and vocal commands are straightforward to capture , but nocipetion requires thermal devices . For a multi - modal symbol , a minimal UI , e . g . , a prototype , should provide the participant with the right context of use to foster elicita - tion . Fig . 5b - c depicts a running GUI prototyping environment where the participant could elicit different symbols for the same GUI command : a stroke gesture ( b ) and / or a mid - air gesture ( c ) . The participant elicits gestures according to the CARE properties [ 22 ] : one gesture ( assignment ) , alternate gestures ( equivalence ) , two combined gestures ( redundancy ) or two gestures making a single function ( complementarity ) . Eliciting more than one symbol Most GES reviewed elicit one gesture per participant for each referent at a time , some repeat this procedure until a certain condition is met , such as the participant is happy with the ﬁnal gesture , the score exceeds some threshold , a combina - tion of measures reaches a certain value . GES should beneﬁt more from methods proposed to increase variations of sym - bols elicited , such as the “Production principle” [ 71 ] where participants should elicit a certain number of symbols before they can move onto the next referent . The trial and error may also inform the elicitation process , namely by computing mea - sures taking into account different votes with different scores ranking the alternatives . In this way , the agreement could be assessed not only on one symbol , but also on all candidates suggested by participants , not just the best one . In the original GES , one symbol is ﬁnally assigned to each function . When there is a small number of functions , the consensus set remains reasonably small , therefore simple and easy to use . When there is a larger number of functions , the consensus set may confuse the end user because of too many symbols to reproduce , thus exceeding people’s cognitive limits . So , instead of mapping a single gesture or a single symbol to a single function , multiple symbols could be com - bined to trigger a function by relying on hierarchical structure and congruence [ 16 ] . For example , Fig . 5d - e depicts a GES for cross - device gesture interaction in which the participant elicits a touch gesture on a 3DTouchPad to copy an object on the source computer ( d ) and a mid - air gesture to paste it on the target computer ( e ) , thus eliciting a touch + air ges - ture [ 19 ] . McNeill identiﬁes two paradigms of interaction [ 69 ] : the “function - object” paradigm in which a function is ﬁrst des - ignated and then an object on which this function will be performed is identiﬁed , and the “object - function” paradigm in which an object is ﬁrst selected and then submitted to a function that is subsequently speciﬁed . Multi - symbol elicita - tion could therefore support both paradigms by eliciting an symbol for the function and another for the object , whatever their ordering is . This approach would be particularly suitable for gestural interaction with a wide range of devices , like in rich smart environments , where too many gestures could be reduced to a smaller subset of gestures designating functions ( on / off , move ) and another gesture for the object ( TV , radio ) . Eliciting for zero to many referents Most GES reviewed target one referent at a time . Zero to many gestures could be elicited as well for more than one referent , especially over time to explore retention , but also to investigate multimodality . The amount of elicited gestures that can be remembered over time by a participant is a function of frequency of usage , along with is relationship with phys - ical and form factors . It is not because a participant elicits a gesture that it will be accurately recognized ( recording the gesture raw data is useful to train a future recognizer and to test its recognition rate [ 113 ] ) , effectively remembered ( the participant may have forgotten the gesture after some period of non - usage ) , and efﬁciently produced ( fatigue , confusion , conﬂict may occur that prevent the participant to reproduce the adequate gesture in context , especially in demanding condi - tions ) . An empirical study could investigate the factors that in - ﬂuence the users’ preferences for gestures ( e . g . , effectiveness , efﬁciency , but also naturalness , social acceptance ) against the system’s performance ( e . g . , how the recognizer will properly Folding , Printing and Exploring Tangible Interactions DIS ’20 , July 6 – 10 , 2020 , Eindhoven , Netherlands 862 Structured Unstructured Informal Formal Sensor raw data ( depth image , infrared , color image , X , Y , Z , t , … ) Gesture live capture Ontology - based gesture description ( e . g . , XML , EBNF gesture grammar ) 3D avatar gesture animation Raise left forearm “Turn left” Figure 6 . ( In ) formal , ( Un ) structured gesture representations . work in context ) . Structured Equation Modelling ( SEM ) [ 106 ] may be an appropriate research method for approaching this question as it performs causal modelling between qualitative and quantitative variables , such as between user’s preference and system’s performance . A referent materializes a function depending on its context [ 15 ] by providing a scene before and after carrying out a function , with its description . A referent presumes not making any reference to how the function could be executed . A referent provides some guidance , but it can bias the participant . Therefore , we suggest a function - less or referent - less method , where participants are proposed to elicit any symbol without referring to any function or refer - ent : “Please give me ten gestures that you would like to use with this new device” . We have to investigate whether any signiﬁcant difference exists between a referent - oriented and a referent - free method [ 60 ] . Multiple representations of referents and symbols Referents used in reviewed GES exploit a wide range of rep - resentations [ 67 ] , ranging from verbalizing the name of its associated function to an almost real application of the func - tion without showing the symbol . The inﬂuence of the referent representation on the elicitation process should be further in - vestigated depending on the context of use , such as whether using alternate representations for the same referent ( e . g . , pre - senting a vocal referent , then a graphical equivalent ) would affect the quality of elicitation . In most cases , a graphical representation is sufﬁcient . Representations that are speciﬁc to a context could be used instead . Gestures elicited in GES reviewed , apart when they also serve afterwards for recogni - tion [ 102 ] , are typically captured in an informal , unstructured way , e . g . , by a video to be further interpreted by an observer . When the elicited gesture is really captured by the sensor , thus producing raw data , this representation could be transformed into an informal , structured representation ( Fig . 6 ) , and then submitted to interpretation to derive a formal and structured representation . Creating a gesture ontology , e . g . , based on an Extended Backus - Naur Form ( EBNF ) grammar leading to a XML - compliant representation [ 79 ] , would enable ex - pressing any gesture in a common format for computational analysis . This representation could automatically generate a formal , structured representation , such as a 3D animation of a gesture . The connections among these representations could be explored via different mechanisms , such as computer vi - sion , gesture recognition , ontology querying , automatic avatar generation , image processing , and deep learning of the videos . Closed vs . Open Elicitation Most GES reviewed foster an open elicitation : participants pro - pose whatever symbol they want in an unconstrained manner . A closed elicitation invites participants to select symbols from a predeﬁned set , e . g . , via a mapping procedure , thus constrain - ing their choice . Open elicitation keeps the process as natural and creative as possible , assuming that the elicitation captures all variables at once . The symbol set is unlimited , sometimes allowing too many symbols to be elicited , from which little or no consensus emerges . Closed elicitation tends to increase the agreement among participants due to their limited choice , but prevents them from being creative . An open elicitation should precede a closed one : after participants elicited their initial ges - tures and after computing the initial agreement , they enter into a closed elicitation to converge towards a better agreement or better other measures , thus limiting the size of the consensus set . This approach is proposed in framed guessability [ 14 ] . Reversing elicitation GES reviewed all share at least a forward elicitation , which was a condition for inclusion . Identiﬁcation studies ( [ 123 ] , p . 1091 ) are the reverse of elicitation studies : the symbols are presented to participants , who are asked what they think those symbols would do or would cause to happen in the in - teractive system . Identiﬁcation studies can serve as validation for elicited gesture sets , but this approach is rarely applied in reviewed GES . Ali et al . [ 3 ] formalize and discuss this process . With both elicitation and identiﬁcation studies , more degrees of freedom : participants either propose the symbols they want with respect to a referent or not ( e . g . , a gesture out - of - the - blue , a gesture associated to a known function ) or vice versa ( e . g . , propose a function and / or a referent for a gesture they already master ) . Legacy bias [ 71 ] prevents participants from propos - ing original , creative gestures in some circumstances , even modiﬁed [ 45 ] , but could foster consistent gestures [ 50 ] . Multiple measures for elicited symbols Although the agreement is the most frequent measure found in GES reviewed , each symbol could be assessed by one or many measures deﬁned by a measurement method . A measure could be qualitative ( e . g . , user satisfaction ) or quantitative ( e . g . , complexity of the symbol ) , objective or subjective . A qualitative objective measure could could describe what the gesture is , e . g . , based on a textual representation ( Fig . 6 ) : “The participant’s hand moves with ﬁve ﬁngers across the ta - ble . ” Any measurement method should be appropriate for the referent provided . While agreement is mostly computed by scores [ 114 , 123 ] and rates [ 115 ] , computing agreement rigorously is not straightforward and alternate measurements exist [ 35 , 59 , 109 , 113 ] . Recently , agreement has been progres - sively superseded by disagreement computation [ 113 , 126 ] . Other measures could conﬁrm or disconﬁrm the preferences elicited , such as methods for consolidating votes from partici - pants on symbols : the Condorcet method [ 83 ] , the de Borda method [ 31 ] , and the Dowdall method [ 36 ] . Each method ranks symbols based on votes ( e . g . , end users’ preferences ) and choose a winning symbol with their own rule : “select the symbol that beats any other symbol in exhaustive pairwise comparison” for Condorcet , “select the symbol that on aver - age stands highest in the preferences” for de Borda . These methods sort symbols in different orders . Folding , Printing and Exploring Tangible Interactions DIS ’20 , July 6 – 10 , 2020 , Eindhoven , Netherlands 863 Other symbol assessment than with agreement While ( dis ) agreement represents a key measure to be assessed among participants in reviewed GES , the overall evaluation of elicitation output could be assessed by other measures , which then strives for a more holistic computational model of accept - ability of elicited symbols , not just based on agreement . For example , a GES could balance end users’ agreement with the biomechanical capabilities of the gesture ( e . g . , hand supination is more powerful than pronation ) . This approach reﬂects the mobility of some limbs and the tendency to rely on the most mobile limbs and gestures . Our SLR identiﬁed several other measures beyond agreement which could feed a more general weighted model . Such a model could express symbols as a vector of pairs ( property , value ) and rely on similarity metrics used in information retrieval and in artiﬁcial intelligence to relate items to each other . Madapena et al . [ 59 ] consider an overall assessment with other variables than merely agreement . The identiﬁcation of these variables , their values , and their weightings remain to be determined in a cost function assess - ing the elicited symbol as a whole . This cost function , based on the Structured Equation Modelling , exhibits the capabil - ity of model - based optimization of gesture experience based on selected variables , such as agreement but not only ( e . g . , agreement AND ( fatigue OR memorability ) ) . Restarting from the context of use and reproducibility Some GES are stripped from the context of use and the con - ditions in which the experiment took place , thus leaving the correct application of its results uncertain for the designer . To restore this importance , any GES should explicitly deﬁne this context ( e . g . , user , device , environment ) so that any repetition for the same context or any variation along any contextual dimension would facilitate the establishing of relationships among GES : by repetition ( same context ) , by generalization ( a dimension is more general than a previous one ) , by restriction ( a dimension is more speciﬁc that a previous one ) , by depen - dency . Typical contextual variations include : conducting GES simultaneously for multiple users ( e . g . , comparing sighted vs . blind users for the same functions [ 47 ] , how culture in - ﬂuence gestures for internationalization [ 30 , 100 ] ) , multiple platforms / devices / sensors ( e . g . , measure the consistency of gestures elicited by one participant for one referent on many devices [ 119 ] , designing consistent gestures across several de - vices [ 26 ] ) , and in multiple environments ( e . g . , eliciting ﬁnger gestures while standing vs . running [ 10 ] ) . Non - traditional de - vices , such as drones [ 94 ] , intelligent textiles and clothes , knit - ted capacitive touch interfaces , shape - changing interfaces [ 68 ] , particularly foldable , bendable , rollable displays , should be also investigated . For any very new device , a referent - free elic - itation could be ﬁrst conducted , especially when no gesture taxonomy already exists for this device , for example a squeez - able interactive cushion . No GES exists for non - classical environments at home ( e . g . , a kitchen , a bathroom , a sleep - ing room ) and their furniture ( e . g . , a table , a chair , a cabinet , a lamp ) , at work ( e . g . , collaborative gestures in a corporate environment with analysis of spatial zones [ 86 ] ) , at leisure ( e . g . , a sport room , a movie theater , outdoor sports ) . Thanks to computer vision , gestures can be elicited on any interaction surface beyond surface computing : ﬂoors ( for foot - based inter - action ) , walls , ceiling , windows [ 101 ] , doors and their handles , etc . An explicit deﬁnition of the GES context of use is the cornerstone for reproducible research [ 41 ] , deﬁned by ACM via three badges : repeatability ( same team , same experimental setup ) , replicability ( different team with the same experimen - tal setup ) , and reproducibility ( different team and a different experimental setup ) . We found only one GES for replicabil - ity [ 103 ] and one for reproducibility [ 75 ] , which seems very little in regard to the empirical validation found for other as - pects . The same question arises for any modiﬁcation of the GES procedure , such as in [ 45 , 71 ] . Software for conducting a GES distributed in time and space also appears ( e . g . , [ 2 , 61 ] for conducting studies , [ 3 ] for analyzing the results via the crowd ) : participants propose symbols in their usual contexts of use , but no study exists that investigates the usage and the impact of such tools on a large scale . Revisiting the elicitation procedure Presentation of referents is independent of the experimenter , who is less likely to ask questions that may affect the par - ticipant . While examining the referent representation , the participant is concentrated on coming up with a proposal , and the experiment produces information that is grounded in the phenomenology of the subject [ 43 ] : “A photograph , a literal rendering of an element of the subject’s world , calls forth associations , deﬁnitions , or ideas that would otherwise go un - noticed . ” Instead of providing the participant with predeﬁned referents , participants could produce them and bring them in the experiment , thus making the experiment more natural to them . Photo - elicitation [ 11 ] encompasses a wide use of graph - ical material , such as pictures , but how and when that material is exploited varies among users and even studies : photovoice , photonarrative , photoessay , photofeedback , and photointer - view . Photoessay [ 108 ] is typically a participatory design method where participants take their own photographs and arrange them with a scenario that make sense for them . This method involves participants more deeply as they are continu - ally deﬁning their context and expressing to the experimenter about how they behave in such a context . These methods empower the end users so that they can tell their stories and interpret their own user experience , culture or any other aspect to the experimenter instead of the other way around . CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper , we conducted a systematic literature review of the whole body of knowledge related to GES , resulting into a corpus of N = 216 gesture elicitation studies conducted with 5 , 458 participants and 3 , 625 referents , eliciting a grand total of 148 , 340 individual gestures , from which 10 , 752 were agreed upon . We highlighted several results regarding the descriptive , comparative , and generative virtues to provide researchers and practitioners with concrete information on how to exploit and to further investigate this huge body of knowledge . We give access to our online collection along with its visualization tool to enable any interested party to perform any other searching , analysis , or other computations on the same corpus . We also refer to our web site for accessing the various source and result documents of this SLR , such as the base of initial documents , the spreadsheet containing the comparison of the 216 GES , and the full range of graphics . We are planning to continuously update this SLR to keep the corpus up - to - date .
