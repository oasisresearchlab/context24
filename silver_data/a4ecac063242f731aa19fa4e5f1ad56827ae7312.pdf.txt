Intrapreneurship and corporate entrepreneurship : an integrated operational and strategic model from dynamic capabilities approach José Carlos Curiel Franco Facultad de Ciencias Económicas y Empresariales Universidad Complutense de Madrid Madrid , Spain josecuri @ ucm . es Miriam Delgado Verde Facultad de Ciencias Económicas y Empresariales Universidad Complutense de Madrid Madrid , Spain miriamdv @ ccee . ucm . es Abstract — Intrapreneurship and Corporate Entrepreneurship are terms used interchangeably to refer to the entrepreneurship within an existing organization , creating confusion in this regard . Based on it , this paper aims to clarify this phenomenon presenting an integrated model which distinguishes between an operational and a strategic approach , both necessary to understand it as a whole . In the operational level , we define intrapreneurship as the process of identification and exploitation of opportunities , whereas we characterize the corporate entrepreneurship , as an entrepreneurial behavior , at the strategic level and related with the firm’s capabilities to innovate , to take risks and to be proactive . In this context , we suggest to study the entrepreneurship within an existing organization from the Dynamic Capabilities approach which affords us a more comprehensive overview of this phenomenon and responds to requests from scholars to integrate the two . In this sense , this theoretical paper offers for researchers , an integrated operational and strategic model , which suggests some propositions relating the capabilities to identify and to exploit opportunities with some dynamics capabilities that extend , modify or create them . For practitioners , we depict some of these capabilities that are needed to ensure the entrepreneurial success . Keywords— Intrapreneurship ; Corporate Entrepreneurship ; Entrepreneurial Orientation ; Resource Based Theory ; Dynamic Capabilities . I . I NTRODUCTION In the current dynamic environment , the entrepreneurship developed within an existing organization is highly worthwhile , because it can be used as a strategy for inducing innovation [ 1 ] , having positive effects on economic growth and employment [ 2 ] . Paradoxically , Ramoglou recently states , that “entrepreneurship research traditionally lacked a foundational theory” [ 3 ] . He also points out that the first attempt to afford a theory of entrepreneurship dates from the seminal paper of Shane & Venkataraman in 2000 [ 4 ] . It should however be remembered that Alvarez & Busenitz disagreed from this approach and proposed to use the existing resource - based theory RBT to study it [ 5 ] . Indeed , Zahra et al . went one step further and suggested to apply the theoretical model of Dynamic Capabilities ( DC ) [ 6 ] . In that regard , it is worth noting that DC have become an important approach in strategic management nowadays [ 7 ] . However , the literature on the entrepreneurship within an existing organization remains underdeveloped from this DC foci . Few attempts have been done since the most influential framework of DC developed by Teece in 2007 where the high order capabilities “sensing , seizing and reconfiguring” [ 8 ] operate to extend , modify or create ordinary ( operational ) ones [ 9 ] . In this vein , Zahra defines the entrepreneurial capabilities as the ability to sense , select , shape and synchronize internal and external conditions for the identification and exploitation of opportunities [ 10 ] [ 11 ] , but any distinction between operational and high order capabilities or DC are done . In fact , the way the dynamic and ordinaries capabilities precisely interact and affect the entrepreneurship within an existing organization , still remains unclear . To fulfil this research gap , we purpose to identify the operational capabilities and the DC involved , and to put forward some propositions . To study the entrepreneurship within an existing organization from the DC approach , means to distinguish between a low - level ( operational ) , and a high - level ( strategic ) . As “intrapreneurship” and “corporate entrepreneurship” are terms used interchangeably creating some confusion in the literature , we suggest to associate the former with the process of identification and exploitation of opportunities , as an operational level , and the latter with the entrepreneurial behavior , as a strategic level . To the best of our knowledge little work has been done distinguishing and relating both , even it might be relevant for large existing organizations in order to identify those required capabilities to successfully start a new venture . Thus , to apply a DC approach and to distinguish between the intrapreneurship and the corporate entrepreneurship as proposed , enable us to related some operational capabilities with the process of identification and exploitation of opportunities , but also some high order or dynamic capabilities with the entrepreneurial behavior of the firm . This in turn allows us to relate the process of identification and exploitation of opportunities with the entrepreneurial behavior of the firm , and through the connection of the operational and the dynamic capabilities , due to the latter extend , modify or create the operational ones . The purpose of this theoretical paper is threefold . First , it proposes to study the entrepreneurship within an existing organization from the DC approach and to frame it from the resource - based theory . Some recent articles suggest a stronger integration of the DC perspective with the entrepreneurship phenomenon , and encourage to increase research and publications in this future direction [ 12 ] . To this end , an integrated model is presented based on two levels . On a low - level of analysis , we recognize the capabilities to identify and to exploit opportunities as operational capabilities which coincide with the term intrapreneurship . In contrast , on a high level of analysis , we distinguish some highest - order capabilities , DC , aligned with the concept of entrepreneurial 2022 I EEE 28 t h I n t e r n a t i o n a l C o n f e r e n c e o n E n g i n ee r i n g , T e c hn o l o g y a nd I nn o v a t i o n ( I C E / I T M C ) & 31 s t I n t e r n a t i o n a l A ss o c i a t i o n F o r M a n a g e m e n t o f T e c hn o l o g y ( I A M O T ) J o i n t C o n f e r e n c e | 978 - 1 - 6654 - 8817 - 4 / 22 / $ 31 . 00 © 2022 I EEE | D O I : 10 . 1109 / I C E / I T M C - I A M O T 55089 . 2022 . 10033148 orientation and which coincide with a strategic approach of entrepreneurship , called corporate entrepreneurship . Secondly , this paper emphasis on the study of these capabilities which are depicted and explained . On one hand , the operational capabilities are aligned with the Kirzner’s entrepreneurial alertness [ 13 ] , and the concept of gestation activities [ 14 ] . On the other hand , and from a strategic approach , the high order capabilities are related with the dimensions of the entrepreneurial orientation : innovativeness , propensity for risk - taking and proactiveness . Finally , we present some propositions between the DC and the operational capabilities , as they extend , modify or create the latter . The work is structured as follows : first of all , we provide a review on the existing literature in order to clarify the terms and to lay the theoretical foundations of the study . Then , we propose an integrated operational and strategic model to analyze the entrepreneurship within an existing organization , which distinguish between ordinaries capabilities ( operational level ) and DC ( strategic level ) . Finally , we formulate some propositions based on the theoretical model and the literature review . II . L ITERATURE REVIEW AND THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK A . Intrapreneurship or corporate entrepreneurship ? Currently , there is no consensus among scholars concerning the terminology used to refer the entrepreneurship within an existing organization , creating some confusion [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] . Since the term intrapreneurship was coined by Gifford and Elizabeth Pinchot in 1978 [ 18 ] , it has been referred to by many as “corporate entrepreneurship” [ 19 ] , “corporate venturing” [ 20 ] , “strategic entrepreneurship” [ 21 ] , “entrepreneurial posture” [ 22 ] , “strategic renewal” [ 23 ] , or “entrepreneurial orientation” [ 24 ] . A non - exhaustive list of the terms used to describe the entrepreneurship within an existing organization is given in the Fig . 1 . TABLE I .

Fig 1 Non - exhaustive list of the terms referred to the entrepreneurship within an existing organization Sharma & Chrisman already criticized this diversity in 1999 , and attempted to distinguish and classify the different terms [ 19 ] . Despite their efforts , we still observe in the literature a rich terminology that sometimes fails to differentiate between the nuances of each term . In fact , we observe that the same term is sometimes used differently by different scholars , and some scholars use different terms to describe the same phenomenon . Also , there is no consensus on the definitions of the entrepreneurship within an existing organization . However , we observe two main approaches to characterize it : an operational level and a strategic level . Whereas the first one , characterizes the phenomenon as a process , the second one defines it as a behavior . In the Fig . 2 we list some definitions that highlight both levels TABLE II .

Fig 2 Examples of defintions distinguishing the operational and the strategic levels In fact , some scholars have previously attempted to differentiate between a strategic level and an operational level [ 15 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , and as shown in the Fig . 3 . Unfortunately , they do not go further in the connections between the two levels as we propose , and they mainly focus on the intrapreneur as an individual at the operational level . TABLE III .

Entrepreneurship , Resource Based Theory and Dynamic Capabilities Regarding the entrepreneurship theory , recently Ramoglou states , that “entrepreneurship research traditionally lacked a foundational theory” , and he points out that the first attempt to afford a theory of entrepreneurship dates from the seminal paper of Shane & Venkataraman published on 2000 [ 3 ] : “The promise of Entrepreneurship as a field of research” , it is the most cited entrepreneurship article in the last decade and their authors seek to better identify a distinctive domain of entrepreneurship , focusing on Kirzner’s view of entrepreneurial opportunities . However , Alvarez & Busenitz totally disagreed with Shane & Venkataraman , and instead , they took the view of the resource - based theory ( RBT ) [ 5 ] . This theory aims to understand why certain organizations enjoy some competitive advantages over others , based on the study of resources and capabilities . In this sense , these authors argue that entrepreneurship and RBT , adopt precisely the same unit of analysis , that is the resource , and they overlapping interests , such as knowledge , firm adaptation to environmental change , modes of organizing and the exploitation of opportunities . Recently , Wibbens insisted on the need to augmented the RBT with the notion of higher - order resources ( or higher order capabilities ) in order to explain how certain organizations are able to systematically develop and maintain favourable resource ( capability ) positions in their product markets , and thereby provides a way to characterize dynamic capabilities ( DC ) within the RBT [ 27 ] . Also named high order capabilities , DC are defined as those that operate to extend , modify or create ordinary capabilities [ 9 ] . The DC approach is characterized as an extension of the RBT [ 28 ] . On the field of the entrepreneurship , the most influential framework of DC was developed in 2007 by Teece [ 8 ] . This author identified three dynamic capabilities to achieve technological innovation : sensing , seizing and reconfiguring . Sensing is related with capacities to learn , as well as to sense , filter , shape and calibrate opportunities . Whereas , the capability to seize opportunities take the form of firm structures , procedures , designs and incentives . Finally , the reconfiguring capability refers to the continuous alignment and realignment of specific tangible and intangible assets [ 29 ] . Previously , Zahra et al . have already suggested to apply the theoretical model of Dynamic Capabilities ( DC ) to the entrepreneurship [ 6 ] , and later , Zahra , taken up Teece ' s model , defines the entrepreneurial capabilities as the abilities to sense , to select , to shape and to synchronize internal and external conditions for the identification and exploitation of opportunities [ 11 ] . In either case , none of these models suggested by Teece or Zahra fit in our proposal : they neither distinguish between the process of identification and exploitation of opportunities ( intrapreneurship ) and the entrepreneurial behavior ( corporate entrepreneurship ) , nor establish any connection between the operational and the strategic level . For this reason , we present a model below which enable us to integrate the DC perspective with the entrepreneurship within an existing organization , as suggested recently by Schilke et al . [ 12 ] . C . Intrapreneurship and the operational approach The initial research on the entrepreneurship within an existing organization focused on the characteristics of the intrapreneur , described as someone innovative within an organization [ 30 ] , hence the term intrapreneurship . In fact , there is still a certain tendency to use this term in this thematic area , related with the individual [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 31 ] . Nevertheless , the publication of the seminal paper of Shane & Venkataraman in 2000 introduced the concept of the individual - opportunity nexus , becoming the “opportunities” the new central core of the entrepreneurship . Since then , some consensus has been reached in the literature to define this phenomenon as the process of identification and exploitation of opportunities [ 33 ] . The identification of opportunities corresponds to the first step of the entrepreneurship process . It comprises , first of all , the action of search [ 34 ] ( Alvarez & Busenitz , 2007 ) , related with the concept of the entrepreneurial alertness [ 35 ] ; secondly , the action of processing information [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] ; and finally the actions of evaluation and decision - making [ 33 ] . Once the opportunity has been selected , its development arises with the exploitation , which corresponds with the last step of the process . As a result , a new product or even a new venture is expected after encompassed multiple actions . In fact , throughout the exploitation of the opportunity , the process becomes more complex , redirecting or recombining resources [ 39 ] . However , some scholars seek to highlight some actions that are considered demonstrative of business creation process , namely gestation activities [ 14 ] [ 40 ] . These activities come from the Panels Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics PSED , which establish around twenty - thirty activities that are assumed to be necessary to starting up a new business [ 14 ] . In light of all this , we define intrapreneurship as the process of identification and exploitation of opportunities within an existing organization , and we frame it in an operational level characterized by many ordinary actions , sequenced in a complex manner . Nevertheless , to focus just on the process is to tell only half the story , and it is also important to tackle a strategic approach in order to get a complete vision of the entrepreneurship phenomenon within an existing organization . D . Corporate entrepreneurship and the strategic approach We have related the term intrapreneurship with the operational level and we recognize the term corporate entrepreneurship ( CE ) for the strategic level . The term CE , widely developed in the 1990s [ 41 ] [ 42 ] , was attributed to Burgelman in 1983 [ 43 ] . In contrast to the concept of intrapreneurship , CE offers a broader vision including many other terms with different nuances : corporate venturing , strategic entrepreneurship , entrepreneurial orientation , amongst others . In this sense , we observe still some attempts in the literature to rearrange , to regroup and to classify them . For instance , Kuratko et al . state that CE encompassed the corporate venturing , which refers to the new venture creation , and the strategic entrepreneurship which deals with the transformation of on - going organizations through strategic renewal [ 44 ] , and some years later they added the concept of entrepreneurial orientation ( EO ) [ 45 ] . The concept of EO is not new ; it was developed by Miller in 1983 , and it was formalized in the entrepreneurship literature by Covin & Slevin in 1989 , but it remains a “vibrant research topic” as Covin & Wales recently affirm [ 46 ] . According to these authors , EO refers to an organizational attribute reflecting how ‘‘being entrepreneurial’’ is manifested in the organization . Thus , a firm’s orientation can range more conservative to more entrepreneurial , with the entrepreneurial end of the spectrum evidenced by innovativeness , risk taking and proactiveness [ 24 ] . It is worth noting , that this range and this end of the spectrum is quite relevant for large existing organizations , while for small startups , the identification and the exploitation of opportunities becomes the strategic raison d ' être , even if to take risks , to innovate and to be proactive , are mostly needed to ensure the entrepreneurial success . Based on the foregoing , we define corporate entrepreneurship as the entrepreneurial behavior inside established organizations [ 45 ] , and we highlight the related concept of EO and the dimensions of innovativeness , risk taking and proactiveness . III . THE INTEGRATED OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC MODEL A . Intrapreneurship , operational level and operational capabilities A major advantage to define intrapreneurship as a process of identification and exploitation of opportunities is that it contributes to frame the entrepreneurship within an existing organization into the Resource Based Theory ( RBT ) . In fact , we adopt precisely the resource as the same unit of analysis as Alvarez & Busenitz suggest [ 5 ] . According to the ISO 9001 : 2000 a process is defined as a series of actions that transform inputs into outputs through the use of resources . In this sense , Ardichvil et al . state that an opportunity is an underemployed or underutilized resource [ 39 ] . Moreover , many scholars describe the identification of entrepreneurial opportunities as an ability [ 39 ] [ 46 ] consequently it enables us to take a step further and to tackle the process of identification and exploitation of opportunities from a DC approach . The entrepreneurial capability to identify opportunities mostly coincides with the concept of alertness , created by Kirzner in 1979 , which describes the ability to notice opportunities that have hitherto been overlooked [ 36 ] . From a broader view , this means scanning and searching for information but also , connecting previously - disparate information and making evaluations and judgement on the existence of business opportunities [ 13 ] . In this sense , we define the capability to identify opportunities as a set of capabilities which regroups the capability to search information , the capability to process the information , and finally the capability to evaluate the opportunity to exploit . More precisely , the concept of search is a crucial factor in the identification of opportunities [ 34 ] , and depends on superior information processes , specific techniques , and scanning behavior [ 47 ] . In this sense , Kuckertz add the importance of communicate with others , as customers , experts , friends , colleagues , in order to gather information [ 48 ] , and Valliere highlights the notion of entrepreneurial attention , based on pay attention and related with the traditional concept of alertness [ 39 ] . Nevertheless , some scholars give up the search , and propose a serendipitous identification approach [ 49 ] , or even a spontaneous recognition [ 47 ] . Serendipity is defined as an unexpected discovery of opportunity brought about by purposeful action [ 50 ] . In this ambiguous context of search and spontaneous recognition , Aldawod suggests that some opportunities are recognized as a result of a mixture of random chance and intentional search [ 51 ] . Once the new information is received it must be processed . In fact , the identification of opportunity also involves perceiving links or connections between seemingly independent events or trends [ 13 ] . The process through these complex and seemingly unrelated events are conceived as constituting identifiable patterns , is defined as a pattern recognition [ 37 ] . From the recognition of a common pattern , vein , Gaglio & Katz propose the schema theory to deal with the information received . Schemas are cognitive structures of organized prior knowledge abstracted from experience and learning process [ 46 ] . They act as data reduction devices which allow to interpret incoming information and make sense of it [ 52 ] . Another perspective we have noticed from the literature review is the creative approach . According to Dimov , the identification of opportunities emerges through the continuous shaping and development of raw ideas , rather than single insights [ 53 ] . Creativity is as “an iterative process of divergent and convergent thinking to generate , evaluate , refine , and eventually come up with a creative idea” [ 54 ] . Divergent thinking reflects the general ability to produce multiple and original ideas , whereas convergent thinking relies on making associations within one domain . Finally , once the information is processed , judgment and an evaluation arise in order to decide to exploit or not the opportunity . According to Tang et al . making judgments allows to sense opportunities and to choose among multiple possibilities [ 13 ] . Evaluation of ideas entails some determinations about feasibility regarding profit potential , window of opportunity , resource attainability , resource availability , time demands , and other factors [ 55 ] . In fact , Tang et al . distinguish between first - person and third - person opportunity [ 13 ] . This latter occurs when a potential opportunity exists for someone but not for everyone , whereas first person opportunity takes place when we believe to possess the resources to exploit it . In short , the decision to exploit or not the opportunity depends on the profitability and the feasibility . In Fig 4 , we list the capabilities to identify opportunities . TABLE IV .

Fig 4 Capabilities to identify opportunities and related actions . Once the opportunity is selected , it must be exploited . The exploitation of opportunities involves also a set of entrepreneurial capabilities , which allows to redirect and to recombine all the necessary resources to develop the identified opportunity . In this sense , an organization with the capability to exploit opportunities requires the capability to plan and articulate processes and actions , the capability to mobilize internal and external resources and finally the capability to obtain internal and external support . These capabilities are based on those proposed by Zahra [ 11 ] and Guo named “shaping” and “synchronizing” [ 56 ] , but also on the different actions called gestation activities and suggested by Davidsson & Honig [ 14 ] . More precisely , the exploitation of opportunities requires some actions in order to plan , to protect intellectual property , and to deal with the administration . From the list of the gestation activities suggested by Davidsson & Honig , we recognize the actions of writing a business plan , obtaining a patent or a license , or formalizing the creation of a new firm , that make up all together the capability to plan and articulate processes and actions [ 14 ] . For instance , business planning specifies how the information will be used to exploit the opportunity . According to Delmar & Shane is a valuable activity , that facilitates faster decision making , provides tools for managing the supply and demand of resources in a manner that avoids time - consuming , bottlenecks and identifies action steps to achieve broader goals in a timely manner [ 57 ] . Another action from the list suggested by Davidsson & Honig is to apply for a patent [ 14 ] . To grant a patent involves to prevent imitation , to reach strong positions in negotiations and to block the competitors patenting efforts or enhancing the firm’s reputation [ 58 ] . In this vein , we highlight other actions related with the intellectual property , as to obtain a trade mark , but also a license in order to complies with the local regulations . Sometimes , the exploitation of opportunities also includes to form a new legal entity . That means to achieve some bureaucracies , as to apply for a tax certificate , or to choose the legal form . Other essential actions of the exploitation of opportunities are the acquisition of raw materials and equipment , the recruitment of staff or the development of prototypes , market studies , or marketing campaigns [ 59 ] . These kinds of actions are regrouped in what we call the capability to mobilize internal and external resources . Compared with others capabilities , it apparently shows a significant commitment with the exploitation of opportunity [ 60 ] due to the resources involved and the investment to be made . In a context of resource scarcity , the capability to mobilize internal and external resources is related with the concept of bricolage , defined as “making do by applying combinations of the resources at hand to new problems and opportunities” [ 61 ] . Finally , we identify another group of actions required in the exploitation step , as to access of funding , to reach agreements with external actors , as clients , suppliers or institutions , but also to get help from other departments and to be welcomed by the top management [ 14 ] . It is what we call the capability to obtain internal and external support . In this sense Stejskal & Hajek , affirm that both internal and external collaboration significantly contribute to the creation of innovation , even though , the internal dimension contributes to a lesser extent than the external , or even their mutual combination [ 62 ] . In fact , the external collaboration is more efficient and fruitful if the external actors possess resources that complement its own and that are relevant to the opportunity [ 63 ] . Nowadays , the collaboration with external actors is deemed especially important in the “open innovation paradigm” [ 64 ] . Open innovation model relies on the notion that a single organization cannot successfully innovate in isolation , and firms should become more permeable and engage in flexible networks with different external actors [ 65 ] . In this vein , receiving funding has become very important nowadays because , in general , the organization not only obtain financial capital support but also complementary assets from their corporate investors [ 66 ] . In Fig 5 , we list the capabilities to exploit opportunities . TABLE V .

Fig 5 Capabilities to exploit opportunities and related actions . B . Corporate entrepreneurship , strategic level and dynamic capabilities Once we have analyzed the intrapreneurship as a process , and having recognized the capabilities to identify and to exploit opportunities as operational , we tackle the strategic level in order to offer a global vision about the entrepreneurship within an existing organization . As we mentioned before , Covin & Wales recently propose “to conceive of Entrepreneurial Orientation as an attribute” [ 46 ] , however Baruah & Ward affirm that “Miller suggested that firm level entrepreneurship can be considered in terms of the firm’s ability to innovate , take risks and be proactively” [ 30 ] . Thus , we propose not considering the dimensions of EO as attributes but as capabilities of the organization that ultimately define the entrepreneurial behaviour . As the firm’s capabilities to innovate , to take risks and to be proactive are developed at the strategic level , we presume they could extend , modify or create operational ones , as Dynamic Capabilities . In this sense , we present a synoptic model in Fig . 6 , which integrate the operational level and a strategic level , and distinguish between intrapreneurship and corporate intrapreneurship , and between ordinaries capabilities and high order or dynamics capabilities . TABLE VI . FIGURE OF INTEGRATED OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC MODEL Fig 6 Synoptic model . The innovativeness dimension is defined by Lumpkin & Dess as the organization ' s propensity to participate in , and support new ideas , novelty , experimentation and creative processes [ 67 ] . Thus , from the DC approach , we define the dynamic entrepreneurial capability to innovative as the organization ' s capability to foster creativity and experimentation . As it refers directly to creativity , the dynamic capability to innovative should contribute to notice new business ideas when looking for information , but also to link seemingly unrelated pieces of information , and thus increase the capabilities to search and to process information . Furthermore , innovativeness facilitates shared vision and minimize possible mistakes made by employees [ 68 ] , and as a consequence , it increases the capability to evaluate and DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES dynamic capability to innovative OPERATIONAL CAPABILITES dynamic capability to take risks dynamic capability to be proactive Strategic Level Corporate entrepreneurship Operational Level Intrapreneurship entrepreneurial capability to identify opportunities capability to search information capability to process information capability to evaluate the opportunity entrepreneurial capability to exploit opportunities capability to plan and articulate processes and actions capability to mobilize internal and external resources capability to obtain internal and external support select the opportunity . Moreover , the experimentation with new processes and production methods that involves to innovative [ 69 ] , influences the capability to plan and articulate processes and actions to support the execution of the opportunity and the capability to mobilize internal and external resources . Therefore , we formulate the following propositions concerning the dynamic capability to innovative and the intrapreneurship process . P1 : The dynamic capability to innovative is positively related with the entrepreneurial capabilities to identify opportunities . P2 : The dynamic capability to innovative is positively related with the entrepreneurial capabilities to exploit opportunities . The risk - taking dimension is related with uncertainty . Thus , we define the dynamic entrepreneurial capability to take risks as the capability to accept uncertainty and commit resources in spite of it . As the cost of inaction can be sometimes very high , the dynamic capability to take risks leads organizations to face the risk of losing an opportunity [ 70 ] , and directly affects the capability to select the opportunities to be exploited . Likewise , risk - taking leads the organization to get into debt [ 71 ] and in consequence , this dynamic capability facilitates access to the necessary resources to new businesses , increasing the capability to mobilize internal and external resources . As a result , we formulate the following propositions concerning the dynamic capability to take risks and the intrapreneurship process . P3 : The dynamic capability to take risks is positively related with the entrepreneurial capabilities to identify opportunities . P4 : The dynamic capability to take risks is positively related with the entrepreneurial capabilities to exploit opportunities . Finally , the proactivity dimension relates to a forward - looking perspective , in which organizations actively seek to anticipate opportunities to develop and introduce new products [ 72 ] . In this sense , Covin & Slevin relate proactivity to aggressiveness , arguing the introduction of new products into the market must be aggressive [ 24 ] . We define the dynamic entrepreneurial capability to be proactive as the capability to anticipate and take the initiative . As proactivity increases the organization ' s responsiveness to market signals and customer needs [ 72 ] , the dynamic capability to be proactive increase the capabilities to search and process information . In this sense , proactivity also helps to create first - mover advantages for an alliance creating products ahead of competitors or through early domination of a market [ 73 ] . Furthermore , as to be proactive implies to anticipating and addressing future problems , and to plan consists on the identification of future problems and opportunities , but also prepares for them at the present time [ 74 ] , the dynamic capability to be proactive increase the capabilities to plan and articulate processes and actions . In view of these statements , we formulate the following propositions concerning the dynamic capability to take risks and the intrapreneurship process . P5 : The dynamic entrepreneurial capability to be proactive is positively related with the entrepreneurial capabilities to identify opportunities . P6 : The dynamic entrepreneurial capability to be proactive is positively related with the entrepreneurial capabilities to exploit opportunities . To sum up , these propositions are presented in a theoretical model in Fig . 7 . TABLE VII . FIGURE OF THEORETICAL MODEL AND PROPOSITIONS Fig 7 Theoretical Model IV . CONCLUSIONS While some recent articles encourage to increase publications related with the Dynamics Capabilities ( DC ) , some scholars of entrepreneurship currently claim for a theoretical framework in the field . In this context we have presented an integrated operational and strategic model to study the entrepreneurship within an existing organization from the DC approach . The model offers quite a few advantages in entrepreneurship research . First of all , it clarifies the terms intrapreneurship and corporate entrepreneurship used to date interchangeably . Secondly , it proposes to study the phenomenon from a DC approach contributing to frame the entrepreneurship on the Resource Based Theory . Thirdly , it offers a global and coherent vision of the entrepreneurship within an existing organization , considering not just the strategic entrepreneurial behavior but also the process of identification and exploitation of opportunities . Fourthly , it integrates the operational level ( intrapreneurship ) and the strategic level ( corporate entrepreneurship ) through the DC approach , distinguishing between the operational capabilities to identify and to exploit opportunities and the entrepreneurial dynamic capabilities to innovate , to take risks and to be proactive . Fifthly , it facilitates formulating some proposition and even some positives relations between the entrepreneurial dynamic capabilities and the operational capabilities . Together with the integrated model , we have depicted some capabilities needed a priori to ensure the entrepreneurial success . Furthermore , we have illustrated , through examples and from the literature , how the dynamic capability to innovative dynamic capability to take risks dynamic capability to be proactive capability to search information capability to process information capability to evaluate the opportunity capability to plan and articulate processes and actions capability to mobilize internal and external resources capability to obtain internal and external support CAPABILITY TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES CAPABILITY TO EXPLOIT OPPORTUNITIES P1 P3 P4 P5 P2 P6 entrepreneurial dynamic capabilities extend , modify or create these operational capabilities related with the identification and exploitation of opportunities . However , even the current paper offers some propositions , future empirical research is needed to validate them . Another limitation of this study is that we have considered only the firm’s dynamic capabilities to innovate , take risks and be proactive , even some scholars mention a few more . Finally , as for many small start - ups the identification and the exploitation of opportunities becomes the strategic raison d ' être in these ventures , the operational level and the strategic level depicted might be blurred .
