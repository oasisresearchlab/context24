Quail ( quail @ berkeley . edu ) Keywords Photomorphogenesis , PIFs , Histone acetylation , Transcriptional regulation Abstract As sessile organisms , plants must adapt to a changing environment , sensing variations in resource availability and modifying their development in response . Light is one of the most important resources for plants , and its perception by sensory photoreceptors ( e . g . phytochromes ) and subsequent transduction into long - term transcriptional reprogramming have been well characterized . Chromatin changes have been shown to be involved in photomorphogenesis . However , the initial short - term transcriptional changes produced by light and what factors enable these rapid changes are not well studied . Here , we identify rapidly light - responsive , PIF ( Phytochrome Interacting Factor ) direct - target genes ( LRP - DTGs ) . We found that a majority of these genes also show rapid changes in Histone 3 Lysine - 9 acetylation ( H3K9ac ) in response to the light signal . Detailed time - course analysis of transcriptional and chromatin changes showed that , for light - repressed genes , H3K9 deacetylation parallels light - triggered transcriptional repression , while for light - induced genes , H3K9 acetylation appeared to somewhat precede light - activated transcription . However , real - time imaging of transcription elongation revealed that , in fact , H3K9 acetylation also parallels transcriptional induction . Collectively , the data raise the possibility that light - induced transcriptional and chromatin - remodeling processes are mechanistically intertwined . Histone modifying proteins involved in long term light responses do not seem to have a role in this fast response , indicating that different factors might act at different stages of the light response . This work not only advances our understanding of plant responses to light , but also unveils a system in which rapid chromatin changes in reaction to an external signal can be studied under natural conditions . Introduction One of the most drastic changes during plant development is deetiolation , the switch from skotomorphogenesis ( development in the dark ) into photomorphogenesis ( development in the light ) . This change not only implies switching from heterotrophy to autotrophy , but also includes several developmental changes such as reduced hypocotyl elongation , opening of the apical hook and greening of cotyledons ( Schafer and Nagy , 2006 ; Franklin and Quail , 2010 ) . Light signals that trigger deetiolation are perceived by photoreceptors . In Arabidopsis , phytochrome A ( phyA ) and phyB are the main sensors that regulate early photomorphogenesis ( Franklin and Quail , 2010 ) . Upon photoactivation , the active phy is translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where it physically interacts with Phytochrome Interacting Factors ( PIFs ) , inducing their rapid transphosphorylation , ubiquitination and proteasome - mediated degradation of the phy - PIF complex ( Bauer et al . , 2004 ; Nagatani , 2004 ; Al - Sady et al . , 2006 ; Jiao et al . , 2007 ; Bae and Choi , 2008 ; Pfeiffer et al . , 2012 ; Ni et al . , 2013 , 2014 , 2017 ) . PIFs are a subfamily of bHLH transcription factors , comprising eight members in Arabidopsis thaliana . PIF1 , PIF3 , PIF4 and PIF5 ( known as the “PIF quartet” ) have a central role in maintaining the transcriptional program that underlies skotomorphogenic development ( Leivar et al . , 2008 ; Shin et al . , 2009 ) . The quadruple mutant for these four PIFs ( pifq ) displays a phenotype in total darkness that strongly resembles that of normal light - grown wild - type seedlings ( Leivar et al . , 2008 ; Shin et al . , 2009 ) . To identify PIF - direct target genes ( PIF - DTGs ) , our group analyzed the genome - wide binding profile of each of the PIF quartet members by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation - sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) , and the corresponding transcriptomic profile of dark - grown wild type , pifq , single pif and triple pif mutants , by RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) ( Hornitschek et al . , 2012 ; Zhang et al . , 2013 ; Pfeiffer et al . , 2014 ) . Integration of both datasets allowed the identification of 338 PIF - DTGs , genes whose promoter region is bound by one or more PIF quartet members at a G - box or PIF Binding Element ( PBE ) , and whose transcript levels are misregulated in pifq mutant plants grown in the dark ( Pfeiffer et al . , 2014 ) . General transcriptional reprogramming that results in photomorphogenesis , occurs upon light exposure of dark - grown plants , as a consequence of PIF degradation ( Leivar et al . , 2009 ) . However , the initial dynamics of light - induced transcriptional changes of PIF - DTGs has not been studied . In eukaryotes , chromatin structure modification is a key factor of transcription regulation ( Venkatesh and Workman , 2015 ) . Among the many histone post - translational modifications , acetylation seems to play a major role in this process ( Jiang et al . , 2020 ) . Histone acetylation , catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases ( HATs ) , has been associated with transcriptional activation , while histone deacetylation by histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) is linked to transcriptional repression ( Pandey et al . , 2002 ) . Whether the role of histone modifications in transcriptional regulation is causal or consequential is not well understood ( Henikoff and Shilatifard , 2011 ; Morgan and Shilatifard , 2020 ) . Previous research has established that histone acetylation plays an essential role during photomorphogenesis ( Barneche et al . , 2014 ) . Transcriptional regulation and development of light - grown plants is greatly altered in Histone 3 Lysine 9 acetylation ( H3K9ac ) deposition ( HAG1 / GCN5 and HAF2 / TAF1 ) and removal mutants ( HDA19 / HD1 ) ( Bertrand et al . , 2005 ; Benhamed et al . , 2006 ; Guo et al . , 2008 ) . Recent evidence suggests that PIF - exerted transcriptional regulation might be executed by altering the histone modification landscape . It has been described that PIF1 and PIF3 directly interact with HDA15 in the dark to repress the expression of germination and chlorophyl biosynthesis genes , respectively ( Liu et al . , 2013 ; Gu et al . , 2017 ) . PIF7 has also been shown to induce H3K9ac deposition on its downstream genes in response to changes in light quality ( Peng et al . , 2018 ; Martínez - García and Moreno - Romero , 2020 ; Willige et al . , 2021 ) . HY5 , a key photomorphogenesis transcription factor also interacts with HDA15 and decreases histone acetylation of genes involved in hypocotyl elongation during photomorphogenesis to repress their expression ( Zhao et al . , 2019 ) . Additionally , phyB has been shown to redundantly control chromatin remodeling to inhibit the transcriptional activation of growth - promoting genes by PIFs ( Kim et al . , 2021 ) . It is still unclear if these factors that control histone acetylation in dark or light - grown plants are also involved in the very initial steps after light exposure that will trigger the photomorphogenesis transcriptional program . Here , to explore the potential role of chromatin remodeling as an intermediary in light - triggered regulation of PIF - DTGs , we focused on H3K9 acetylation as a mark of transcriptionally active genes . We first identified rapid light - responding PIF - DTGs by comparing the transcriptomic profile of dark - grown seedlings with those of dark - grown pifq mutants and dark - grown seedlings after a short red - light treatment . We also profiled genome - wide H3K9ac localization in these plants . We found that the majority of light - responsive PIF - DTGs also showed changes in H3K9ac . We then conducted a detailed time - course analysis of mRNA and H3K9ac levels on selected light - responsive PIF - DTGs . This analysis initially suggested that the relationship between H3K9ac and transcription differs in light - repressed and light - induced PIF - DTGs . Real - time transcription initiation imaging , however , suggests instead that H3K9ac also parallels transcriptional induction in response to light . Results and discussion Identification of rapidly responding , light regulated PIF - direct target genes In our previous work , we defined PIF - DTGs as genes that are miss - regulated in pifq mutant plants grown in the dark and whose promoter is bound by any of the PIF quartet proteins ( Pfeiffer et al . , 2014 ) . In order to identify genes that respond most directly to changes in PIF abundance , we focused on genes whose transcript levels change rapidly in wild - type seedlings after a short exposure to red light , when the PIFs have been almost completely degraded ( Bauer et al . , 2004 ; Shen et al . , 2005 , 2007 ; Lorrain et al . , 2007 ) . For this purpose , we measured genome - wide steady state mRNA levels by RNA - sequencing in “true dark” - grown , wild - type seedlings ( D ) and in “true dark” - grown seedlings treated for one hour with red light ( R1h ) . We also measured mRNA levels in seedlings grown in continuous white light ( WLc ) as a reference expression profile of plants grown during an extended light regimen ( Figure 1A ) . An initial analysis of R1h and WLc transcriptional profiles compared to D showed that the large transcriptional reprogramming occurring in WLc could be triggered by a small number of genes that change rapidly in response to the first exposure to light ( R1h ) . These genes do not necessarily need to be continuously activated or repressed once the transcriptional reprograming has been initiated , our data showed that only somewhat over half of the genes that change initially in response to light exposure remain in that state after an extended light regime ( Supplemental Dataset S2 , Figure S1 ) . Figure 1 . H3K9ac levels change in light - responsive PIF - DTGs ( LRP - DTGs ) both in pifq and in response to red light . A , Experimental setup . Wild type or pifq seedlings were grown in “true dark” conditions and treated for two days before sample collection and processing for mRNA - and H3K9ac ChIP - sequencing . B , Heat - map showing the changes in mRNA and H3K9ac levels comparing dark - grown pifq versus wild type , red - light treated ( R1h ) versus dark - grown wild type ( D ) , and continuous white light - grown ( WLc ) vs dark grown wild - type seedlings . All the PIF - DTGs that showed statistically significant two - fold change in mRNA levels in the same direction in pifq vs wt and R1h vs D are shown . Six light - induced / PIF - repressed and six light - repressed / PIF - induced genes for further analyses are highlighted . C , Read mapping profile of H3K9ac ChIP - seq and RNA - seq in RPT2 , a light - induced LRP - DTG . D , Read mapping profile of H3K9ac ChIP - seq and RNA - seq in PIL1 , a light - repressed LRP - DTG . Note that RNA - seq was performed on 3’ - end purified mRNA . Surprisingly , after R1h , only 19 % PIF - induced PIF - DTGs were repressed , and 15 % of the PIF - repressed PIF - DTGs were induced ( Figure S2 ) . Previously identified PIF - DTGs that do not change rapidly in response to light could have a slower transcriptional response to PIF degradation , be indirectly regulated by them or could have been misidentified as PIF - DTGs due to non - functional PIF binding resulting in a lack of transcriptional regulation ( see below ) . These possibilities are non - mutually exclusive and seem to be occurring . Using the WLc data , we could identify slower - responding PIF - regulated genes : 60 % of PIF - induced PIF - DTGs are both R1h - and WLc - repressed , and 43 % of PIF - repressed PIF - DTGs are R1h - and WLc - induced ( Figure S3 ) . Still , some PIF - DTGs do not show altered transcription either after R1h or WLc . Their altered transcriptional levels in pifq mutants grown in the dark could be caused by indirect effects ( they could be downstream targets of PIF - DTGs ) . Additionally , these genes could represent cases where PIF - binding is non - functional and does not result in transcriptional regulation of the gene downstream of the PIF - binding site , as has been reported for other transcription factors in many ChIP - seq experiments ( Biggin , 2011 ) . These results reflect the limitation of using transcriptomic profiling of constitutive mutants in conjunction with genome wide binding assays to identify transcription factor direct target genes , leading to overestimation of the actual number of direct downstream genes . Complementing these studies with short - term response assays ( in this case R1h ) is essential to narrow down direct targets of transcription factors . In summary , we have identified PIF - regulated genes whose expression changes very rapidly in response to light . These genes are directly regulated by PIFs and are likely candidates to effect the initial changes downstream of light perception that will trigger the photomorphogenesis developmental plan . For convenience , we will use the term “LRP - DTGs” ( for Light Responsive PIF Direct Target Genes ) from here on to refer to the newly redefined genes that are bound by PIFs in the dark , have altered mRNA levels in the pifq mutants in the dark , and respond rapidly to R1h . Gene ontology enrichment analysis of light - repressed / PIF - induced LRP - DTGs revealed that they are enriched in transcription factors and in proteins known to be involved in red light , far - red light and auxin responses . These genes include IAA19 , IAA29 , PIL1 , PIL2 , and HB2 . Light - induced / PIF - repressed LRP - DTGs were also enriched in proteins known to be involved in far - red , red and blue light responses , including genes such as SPA1 , RPT2 , SIGE and LHCB2 . 4 . Chromatin changes shortly after red - light exposure To investigate the possible involvement of rapid chromatin remodeling in the PIF - exerted regulation of LRP - DTGs , we conducted genome - wide profiling of H3K9ac by ChIP - seq in dark - grown wild type and pifq seedlings , and R1h - treated wild type seedlings . We also profiled H3K9ac in wild type seedlings grown in WLc for comparison as we did for transcriptome profiling ( Figure 1A ) . We chose H3K9ac because it is a histone modification that has been shown to be associated with transcriptionally active genes and also involved in long - term transcriptional regulation in continuous white light ( Benhamed et al . , 2006 ; Guo et al . , 2008 ; Gates et al . , 2017 ) . We identified H3K9ac peaks in all samples , and differentially quantified them comparing wt D vs R1h , wt D vs wt WLc , and wt D vs pifq D . We found that the majority of the H3K9ac peaks mapped slightly downstream of the transcriptional start site region irrespective of light treatment , in concordance with previously published results for genome - wide H3K9ac profiles ( Figure S4 ) ( Charron et al . , 2009 ) . In dark - grown pifq , 7089 genes had statistically significantly higher H3K9ac levels than in wild type , while 900 genes had statistically lower H3K9ac levels ( Supplemental Dataset S4 ) . In WLc samples , 6797 genes had higher H3K9ac levels and 2505 genes had lower levels ( Supplemental Dataset S4 ) . These data are consistent with a change in the chromatin profile associated with photomorphogenic - like development in dark - grown pifq plants , where light - responsive genes become activated in the dark in the absence of the PIF quartet . In fact , clustering analysis revealed that the H3K9ac profile of pifq D is more similar to that of WLc - grown wild type than to dark - grown wild type or R1h - treated ( Figure S5 ) . After one hour of red light , 992 genes had statistically significant higher H3K9ac levels than in dark - grown seedlings while 336 genes had lower H3K9ac ( Supplemental Dataset S4 ) . These results indicate that H3K9ac modification occurs only in a small fraction of light - regulated genes initially after light - exposure . H3K9ac levels change in a larger number of genes as light - exposure is sustained over longer periods , in a similar fashion to transcriptional changes . In every condition tested , H3K9ac levels generally correlated with mRNA levels ( R 2 = 0 . 46 for pifq vs D , R 2 = 0 . 45 for R1h vs D and R 2 = 0 . 64 for WLc vs D ) for genes with a SSTF change in mRNA and H3K9ac levels ( Figure S6 ) . To explore whether the PIF quartet are involved in the rapid red - light - induced chromatin changes , we focused our analysis of H3K9ac changes in LRP - DTGs in dark - grown pifq mutants , and in R1h - exposed wild type samples . We found that a high proportion of LRP - DTGs undergo H3K9ac changes that are associated with red - light induced PIF degradation ( Figure 1B , 69 % and 64 % of PIF - induced LRP - DTGs and 68 % and 63 % of PIF - repressed LRP - DTGs in pifq and R1h respectively ) . In addition , the correlation between H3K9ac and mRNA levels was slightly higher when only LRP - DTGs were considered ( R 2 = 0 . 46 for pifq vs D , R 2 = 0 . 65 for R1h vs D and R 2 = 0 . 73 for WLc vs D , Figure S7 ) . In summary , these results show that H3K9ac changes occur in the majority of LRP - DTGs , suggesting that it could be a key regulatory factor in their transcriptional regulation . H3K9 deacetylation parallels light - triggered transcriptional repression and apparently precedes transcriptional induction Given the close parallel between the transcriptional and chromatin responses , we approached the question of whether this represents a causal relationship by performing concurrent time - course analysis of the light - induced responses in these two parameters . For this purpose , we selected six PIF - induced / light - repressed LRP - DTGs ( PIL1 , XTR7 , HB2 , CKX5 , IAA19 and At5g02580 ) and six PIF - repressed / light - induced LRP - DTGs ( RPT2 , SIGE , LNK3 , SPA1 , BOH2 and At1g60590 ) , based on the extent of their changes in mRNA and H3K9ac levels in the genome - wide experiments , and on their potential key roles in red - light responsiveness based on their molecular function ( Figures 1C , 1D and S8 , Table S1 ) . We first confirmed the results of the genome - wide analysis by measuring changes in H3K9ac levels in these 12 genes in response to R1h by ChIP - qPCR ( Figure S9 ) . We then performed a detailed time - course analysis of the rapid changes in mRNA and H3K9ac levels over the one - hour period following initial light exposure . We measured both parameters by RT - qPCR and ChIP - qPCR in the 12 selected LRP - DTGs , at 0 , 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , and 60 minutes after a saturating red - light pulse . In broad terms , H3K9ac and mRNA levels were correlated ( Figure S10 ) . A more detailed analysis showed that the PIF - induced / light - repressed LRP - DTGs display rapid decreases in H3K9ac levels in response to red - light treatment , in parallel with the decrease in mRNA levels , starting just 5 minutes after the red - light pulse ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . A converse pattern can be seen for the PIF - repressed / light - induced LRP - DTGs , where an increase in both mRNA and H3K9ac levels is detected shortly after red - light exposure ( Figure 2C and 2D ) . However , in this case H3K9ac increase seems to occur earlier than mRNA induction , with detectable H3K9ac changes occurring around 10 minutes after the red - light pulse , while the mRNA increase happens 20 minutes after the re - light pulse ( Figure 2C and D ) . These results suggest that H3K9ac deposition is necessary to initiate transcription , while its removal instantly triggers a reduction in steady state mRNA levels . It is also possible that this observed delay in transcription is caused by the fact that we are measuring steady - state levels of processed mRNA by RT - qPCR , and this technique does not capture the exact moment of transcriptional initiation . Real - time transcription imaging reveals an earlier timing of light - induced transcription initiation In order to accurately measure a more continuous transcriptional readout and pinpoint the exact time of transcription initiation in response to light we generated several reporter lines . We first tested if we were able to recapitulate light - induced transcriptional initiation in transgenic lines expressing luciferase under the control of the RPT2 promoter , a light - induced LRP - DTG ( pRPT2 : LUC lines ) . We chose pRPT2 as it showed a strong and robust response to light in all our previous experiments . However , we were not able to detect any significant change in luminescence between pRPT2 : LUC lines grown in the dark and after R1h treatment ( Figure S11A ) . This absence of response was not due to pRPT2 lacking light / PIF responsive elements , as we could detect a large luminescence increase when we transformed this reporter into pifq background ( Figure S11B ) . It is likely that protein reporters that require transcription and translation in order to be measurable are not able to capture these short - term responses . Figure 2 . H3K9ac changes in LRP - DTGs parallel the rapid transcriptional response in light - repressed LRP - DTGs , and apparently precede transcription in light - induced LRP - DTGs . H3K9ac and mRNA changes measured by ChIP - qPCR and RT - qPCR in light - repressed ( A ) and light - induced ( C ) LRP - DTGs after a saturating red light pulse . Averaged mRNA and H3K9ac levels for each group of genes are shown in panels B and D , respectively . Data were re - scaled to the minimum and maximum mRNA / H3K9ac values for each gene . Each colored line represents the averaged mRNA / H3K9ac levels at each time point and the shaded band represents the standard error of the mean ( n = 3 ) . We then generated reporter lines in which we could measure mRNA transcription in real time ( Figure S12 ) . The RPT2 promoter was used to drive transcription of a mRNA tagged in its 5’ with a PP7 sequence recognized by a co - expressed GFP - tagged PP7 phage coat protein , enabling identification of nascent mRNA as fluorescent puncta ( pRPT2 : PP7 - Figure S12 , ( Larson et al . , 2011 ; Alamos et al . , 2021 ) ) . Imaging of dark - grown pRPT2 : PP7 lines exposed to light was able to recapitulate light - induced transcriptional initiation ( Figure 3A ) . We measured real - time mRNA production in four independent pRPT2 : PP7 transgenic lines and we observed that transcription begins approximately 10 minutes after light exposure , slightly earlier than the increase in steady - state RPT2 mRNA levels we detected by RT - qPCR ( Figure 3B ) . The timing of transcription initiation coincides with the increase in H3K9ac levels observed by ChIP - qPCR ( Figure 2C ) . Together , these results suggest that transcription initiation is accompanied by H3K9 acetylation , and , within the time resolution limitations of our experiments , could indicate that they are intertwined processes . H3K9ac writers and erasers involved in long - term light responses do not participate in fast H3K9ac changes in response to light It has been previously reported that the transcriptional program of light - grown plants is disrupted in mutants for H3K9ac deposition ( HAG1 / GCN5 and HAF2 / TAF1 ) and removal ( HDA19 / HD1 ) ( Bertrand et al . , 2005 ; Benhamed et al . , 2006 ; Guo et al . , 2008 ) . To test the possibility that these H3K9ac writer or eraser proteins could be involved in gene regulation shortly after initial light - exposure , we measured mRNA levels of the 12 selected LRP - DTGs in dark - grown and R1h - treated hag1 , haf2 and hda19 mutants . Contrary to what happens to other light - related genes in light - grown seedlings of these mutants , LRP - DTGs expression remained generally unaltered after a short red - light treatment . We only detected R1h - insensitive responses of a few LRP - DTGs ( At1g60590 , LNK3 and BOH2 ) , and only in the hag1 mutants compared to wild type ( Figure S12 ) . These results indicate that these proteins , involved in H3K9ac regulation , and previously identified to have a role in long - term light - induced chromatin states and transcription are not involved in general short - term transcriptional regulation in response to light . Alternatively , another possible explanation is that because of functional redundancy of histone modifiers ( Pandey et al . , 2002 ) , mutation in a single family member is not sufficient to affect the LRP - DTGs rapid transcriptional response to light . It remains to be explored which other possible factors might be responsible for the quick changes in H3K9ac in response to light exposure . Figure 3 .

Data obtained from 2 - 5 technical replicates of four independent pRPT2 : PP7 transgenic lines are represented . Conclusions The aim of the present study was to identify key genes that respond in the first instance to the first light exposure in plants , and understand the factors involved in their regulation . To do this , we focused on the red - light phytochrome signaling pathway . More specifically , centered on PIF direct target genes . We found that only a subset of the previously described PIF - DTGs respond most rapidly to light exposure . We redefined them as LRP - DTGs . These genes probably are the most direct targets of PIF regulation and play a key role in photomorphogenesis initiation . We found that the majority of these genes also show very rapid changes in H3K9ac levels , that accompany their transcriptional response , in the very initial minutes after light exposure . These findings suggest that chromatin remodeling is a crucial part of the very initial light response . This study contributes to our understanding of transcriptional regulation in response to environmental changes , and describes a system in which chromatin dynamics in response to environmental cues can be analyzed . The precise mechanism of how these histone modifications are performed remains to be elucidated . Materials & Methods Plant materials and growth conditions The Columbia - 0 ecotype of Arabidopsis thaliana was used for all experiments . pif1pif3pif4pif5 ( pifq ) line is described in ( Leivar et al . , 2008 ) , hag1 - 5 ( SALK _ 048427 ) in ( Kornet and Scheres , 2009 ) , haf2 - 5 ( SAIL _ 548 _ G03 ) in ( Lee and Seo , 2018 ) and hda19 - 4 ( SALK _ 139443 ) in ( Kim et al . , 2008 ) . To generate pRPT2 : LUC lines , 3342 bp upstream of the RPT2 start codon were amplified by PCR with primers BamHI - pRPT2 - 5 / pRPT2 - 3 - PstI and cloned into the pC1302 - 35S : RLUC vector ( Zhang et al . , 2013 ) . To generate pRPT2 : PP7 lines , 3356 bp upstream of the RPT2 start codon were amplified by PCR with primers 13Rb - RPT2F and 13Rb - RPT2R and cloned into the AL13Rb plasmid ( Addgene # 161006 ) ( Alamos et al . , 2021 ) . Primers are described in Supplementary Dataset S7 . Constructs were transformed into Arabidopsis by the floral dip method ( Clough and Bent , 1998 ) . Plants were germinated in true - dark conditions as described in ( Leivar et al . , 2008 ) . Briefly , seeds were sterilized , plated in MS medium without sucrose under white light and stratified for 4 days at 4ºC in darkness . Afterwards , they were irradiated for 3h with white light to induce germination , followed by a saturating 5 min far - red light pulse . They were grown in the dark at 21ºC for 2 days before being collected ( D samples ) or grown in the dark for 47 hours and treated with 10 μE ⋅ m −2 ⋅ s −1 red light for 1 hour ( R1h samples ) . White - light grown samples ( WLc ) were grown under continuous white - light ( 100 μE ⋅ m −2 ⋅ s −1 PAR ) after stratification for 2 days . For the time - course experiments , a saturating red - light pulse ( 5000 μE in 1 min ) was given after 2 days in the dark and samples were collected at the indicated time - points . RNA sequencing RNA - seq data from dark - grown wild - type and pifq mutants was obtained and analyzed previously by ( Zhang et al . , 2013 ) . Total RNA from 2 - day old “true dark” - grown ( D ) , R1h and WLc treated seedlings was extracted and processed as described in ( Zhang et al . , 2013 ) . RNA was extracted from 100 mg of ground tissue using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit ( Qiagen cat . 74904 ) using RNase - Free DNase ( Qiagen cat . 79254 ) following manufacturer instructions . The sequencing library construction was adapted from 3′ - end RNA - seq protocol ( Yoon and Brem , 2010 ) and performed as described in ( Zhang et al . , 2013 ) . The size of purified library DNA was validated by Bioanalyzer 2000 . Libraries from were assayed by 50 - cycle single - end sequencing on the HiSeq2000 platform . Sequencing reads were aligned to the TAIR9 representative transcriptome using Bowtie ( Langmead et al . , 2009 ) with zero mismatches allowed . Only reads mapping uniquely to the 3′ - end 500 - bp region of the coding strand were counted for gene expression . Differentially expressed genes were identified using the edgeR package ( Robinson et al . , 2010 ) , and SSTF genes were defined as those that differ by ≥2 - fold with an adjusted P value ≤0 . 05 . Sequencing data have been deposited in NCBI ' s Gene Expression Omnibus ( Edgar et al . , 2002 ) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE181167 . Previously published sequencing data can be accessed through GEO Series accession number GSE39217 . Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and sequencing For each replicate , 2 . 5 gr of 2 - day old wild - type and pifq D , R1h and WLc treated seedlings were processed as described in ( Gendrel et al . , 2005 ) using 5 µgr Diagenode Ab C15410004 H3K9ac antibody and a mix of 25 / 25 µl of protein - A / G dynabeads ( Invitrogen ) . 5 - 10 ng of DNA per sample were used for library preparation with Accel - NGS 2S Plus DNA Library Kit ( Swift Biosciences ) and 9 PCR cycles . 300 - 700 bp fragments were purified and sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq 4000 by SR50 Single Read Sequencing . Reads were aligned to Arabidopsis thaliana TAIR10 genome using Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg , 2012 ) . H3K9ac enriched regions were identified using the BayesPeak algorithm with lower - bound summarization method ( Spyrou et al . , 2009 ) . Differential enrichment analysis was performed with DiffBind ( Stark and Brown , 2011 ) , comparing H3K9ac enrichment in these regions among different samples . Only peaks with statistically significant different levels with an FDR ≤0 . 05 were used in the analysis . Sequencing data have been deposited in NCBI ' s Gene Expression Omnibus ( Edgar et al . , 2002 ) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE181432 . Reverse transcription quantitative PCR Total RNA was extracted from 100 mg of dark grown or R1h treated seedlings per biological replicate , and three biological replicates were used per time point using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit ( Qiagen cat . 74904 ) with RNase - Free DNase ( Qiagen cat . 79254 ) following manufacturer instructions . One µgr of RNA was used to make cDNA with the High - Capacity cDNA archive kit ( Thermo cat . 4368814 ) . qPCR reactions were performed with SYBR Green Master Mix ( Thermo cat . 4309155 ) using three technical replicates per reaction in a CFX96 Touch Real - Time PCR Detection System ( Biorad ) .
