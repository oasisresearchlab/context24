Downregulation of Grb2 contributes to the insulin - sensitizing effect of calorie restriction . Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 296 : E1067 – E1075 , 2009 . First published February 24 , 2009 ; doi : 10 . 1152 / ajpendo . 90714 . 2008 . —Calorie re - striction ( CR ) alleviates insulin resistance and has a beneﬁcial effect on numerous metabolic disorders , yet the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated . In the present study , we found that CR of mice ( 60 % of the diet consumption compared with ad libitum mice ) reduces the expression levels of Grb2 in skeletal muscle , an insulin target tissue that accounts for 85 % of insulin - stimulated blood glucose clearance . To determine whether Grb2 downregulation contributes to increased insulin sensitivity in the regulation of glucose metabolism , we generated C 2 C 12 cell lines in which the expression of Grb2 is suppressed by RNA interference . Suppressing Grb2 expression in C 2 C 12 myoblasts enhances insulin - stimulated insulin receptor sub - strate ( IRS ) - 1 , tyrosine phosphorylation , and Akt phosphorylation , which is associated with decreased IRS - 1 serine phosphorylation at residues 307 , 612 , and 636 / 639 . In addition , reducing Grb2 expression levels increased insulin - stimulated glucose uptake in C 2 C 12 myotubes . Reduced IRS - 1 serine phosphorylation is also found in Grb2 (cid:1) / (cid:2) heterozygous knockout mice , which is associated with enhanced insulin signaling and resistance to high - fat diet - induced glucose and insulin intolerance . All together , our results suggested that reducing the expression levels of Grb2 provides a mechanism by which CR increases insulin sensitivity in vivo . mitogen - activated protein kinase ; phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ; insulin sensitivity MODERATE CALORIC RESTRICTION ( CR ) has an insulin - sensitizing effect and attenuates the development of age - associated patho - logical and biological changes in many species , ranging from yeast , rodents , primates , and humans ( 4 , 10 , 19 , 22 , 26 , 31 , 32 , 34 , 35 ) . CR improves insulin sensitivity in the liver of rodents by promoting gluconeogenesis and decreasing fatty acid syn - thesis and glycolysis ( 38 ) . In skeletal muscle , CR enhances insulin signaling ( 28 , 29 ) , stimulates the expression levels of genes involved in gluconeogenesis and fatty acid biosynthesis ( 24 ) , and potentiates insulin - stimulated glucose transport ( 7 ) . Since skeletal muscle accounts for 85 % of insulin - stimulated blood glucose clearance ( 16 ) , improved glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle has been considered to play a key role in enhanced whole body insulin action seen with CR ( 29 ) . Insulin action is initiated by the binding of this hormone to its membrane receptor in insulin target cells , such as liver , fat , and muscle cells , which leads to autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor ( IR ) and subsequent activation of two major pathways , the phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) and the p44 / 42 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathways . Activation of the PI3K pathway , which is critical for regulating glucose homeostasis , is mediated by a series of cellular events including tyrosine phosphorylation of IR substrate ( IRS ) iso - forms and serine phosphorylation of Akt at both Thr 308 in the activation loop and Ser 473 at the COOH terminus . Activation of the p44 / 42 MAPK signaling pathway , which has been impli - cated in insulin - mediated mitogenic events , is mediated by recruiting adaptor proteins , such as Shc and Grb2 , to the tyrosine - phosphorylated IR . Through both the PI3K and the p44 / 42 MAPK pathways , insulin stimulates a variety of cellu - lar responses , including glucose uptake , cellular growth , and differentiation . The underlying mechanisms by which CR increases insulin sensitivity remain to be fully elucidated . Short - time ( 5 – 28 days ) CR has been found to increase insulin sensitivity in rats but had no effect on either the number or the tyrosine kinase activity of the IR , suggesting that the increased insulin sensi - tivity is via a postreceptor mechanism ( 2 , 9 ) . In rhesus mon - keys , the CR - induced increase in insulin sensitivity is unrelated to alterations in glucose transporter 4 , PI3K , and IRS - 1 abun - dance ( 19 ) . On the other hand , CR has been found to increase the ratio of PI3K catalytic - to - regulatory subunits , which may contribute to increased Akt phosphorylation and insulin sensi - tivity ( 30 ) . However , whether altering the ratio of PI3K cata - lytic - to - regulatory subunits is sufﬁcient to mimic the insulin - sensitizing effect of CR remains unknown . In the present study , we show that CR greatly reduced the expression levels of the adaptor protein Grb2 . We also show that reducing Grb2 expression levels is sufﬁcient to enhance insulin - stimulated PI3K signaling , both in cells and in vivo . Our results suggest a potential mechanism by which CR improves insulin sensitivity in vivo . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials .

Cell culture and treatment . For generation of Grb2 - suppressed RNA interference ( RNAi ) stable cell lines , C 2 C 12 myoblasts were transfected with Grb2 RNAi construct or scrambled control and selected with 5 (cid:3) g / ml puromycin as previously described ( 23 ) . The sense and antisense sequences of the RNAi were synthesized and inserted into pSIREN - RetroQ ( BDK knockout RNAi system ; BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) . The sense sequence corresponds to nucleotides 939 – 958 of the mouse Grb2 ( GCATGTTTCCCCG - CAATTAT ) . The sequence ( GCGGTAAGTCGATATGATCA ) was used for the scramble control . C 2 C 12 RNAi and scramble cells were maintained at subconﬂuent conditions in DMEM ( ATCC ) medium containing 100 U / ml penicillin , 100 (cid:3) g / ml streptomycin , and 10 % fetal bovine serum . The differentiation of Grb2 - suppressed and scram - ble C 2 C 12 cells was performed as described previously ( 27 ) . For insulin - stimulated Akt and MAPK phosphorylation , C 2 C 12 myoblasts were serum starved for 5 h , pretreated with or without UO126 for 1 h , and then with or without insulin at different concentrations for 5 min . For IRS - 1 phosphorylation experiments , C 2 C 12 myoblasts were serum starved for 12 h and then treated with or without 50 nM insulin for 5 min . C 2 C 12 cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 0 . 02 M Tris , pH 7 . 6 , 1 % NP40 , 0 . 15 M NaCl , 0 . 15 M NaF , 2 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 5 mM EDTA , and complete cocktail protease inhibitors . Cell lysates were prepared for Western blot or immunoprecipitation experiments . Animal studies . The CR and ad libitum ( AL ) - fed control mice were purchased from the NIA CR Colony ( for more information , please see http : / / www . nia . nih . gov / ResearchInformation / ScientiﬁcResources / AgedRodentColoniesHandbook / CaloricRestrictedColony . htm ) . The CR mice were individually housed , and CR was started at 16 wk of age . The AL control mice were fed with NIH - 31 standard diet , whereas the CR mice were fed with 60 % of the diet consumed by the AL mice for 4 mo . The Grb2 (cid:1) / (cid:2) heterozygous knockout mice were a generous gift by Dr . Tony Pawson and have been described previously ( 11 ) . The Grb2 (cid:2) / (cid:2) homozygous knockout mice die before birth because of nonsufﬁcient differentiation of endodermal cells and formation of the epiblast , but the Grb2 (cid:1) / (cid:2) heterozygous mice are viable and show no obvious defects in normal physiology ( 11 ) . The mice were back - crossed with C57BL / 6 mice for six generations and genotyped by PCR using primers that identiﬁed both the neomycin cassette and genomic DNA ( forward 1 : 5 (cid:4) - aga , ccc , gca , ggt , aaa , gag - 3 (cid:4) ; forward 2 : gga , cat , agc , gtt , ggc , tac - 3 (cid:4) ; reverse : 5 (cid:4) - cct , ggg , aag , cat , gag , ttg - 3 (cid:4) ) . All mice were maintained on a normal light / dark cycle at the Univer - sity of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio . Animal protocols were approved by the University Animal Care and Use Committee . Glucose tolerance tests . Male Grb2 (cid:1) / (cid:2) heterozygous knockout mice and wild - type littermates ( 8 – 10 mice / group ; 4 wk old ) were fed a HFD ( 45 % kcal from fat ; D12451 ; Research Diets ) for 16 wk . The mice were fasted for 16 h and were then intraperitoneally injected with glucose ( 2 g / kg animal body wt ) . Tail venous blood glucose levels were withdrawn at 0 , 15 , 30 , 60 , and 120 min and were measured using a blood glucose monitor ( Rightest GM300 ; Bionime , Dali City , Taiwan ) . Insulin tolerance tests . Male Grb2 (cid:1) / (cid:2) heterozygous knockout mice and wild - type littermates ( 8 – 10 mice / group ; 4 wk old ) housed in a 12 - h light / dark cycle ( lights on from 0900 to 2100 ) were fed with the above mentioned HFD for 16 wk . Grb2 (cid:1) / (cid:2) mice and wild - type littermates were intraperitoneally injected with human insulin ( 0 . 75 U / kg animal body wt ) at 1230 and tail venous blood glucose levels were determined as described above . Insulin signaling in vivo . Male Grb2 (cid:1) / (cid:2) heterozygous knockout mice and wild - type littermates ( 8 – 10 mice / group ; 4 wk old ) were fed with the above mentioned HFD for 16 wk . Mouse body weights were measured once a week . Mice were fasted overnight and intraperito - neally injected with insulin ( 10 U / kg body wt ) or equal volume of saline ( 0 . 1 ml / 10 g body wt ) . After 10 min , mice were euthanized via cervical dislocation , and mouse tissues were immediately excised , frozen in liquid nitrogen , and kept at (cid:2) 80°C until homogenization . To determine the potential effect of CR on insulin signaling , the 8 - mo - old AL and CR mice were fasted overnight and injected intraperitoneally with insulin ( 5 U / kg body wt ) for 5 min . The mice were euthanized , and tissues were excised immediately . Tissue samples were homog - enized in ice - cold lysis buffer containing 50 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 6 ) , 150 mM sodium chloride , 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate , 20 mM (cid:5) - glycerophosphate , 10 mM sodium ﬂuoride , 2 mM sodium or - thovanadate , 2 mM EDTA , 1 . 0 % Igepal , 10 % glycerol , 2 mM PMSF , 1 mM magnesium chloride , 1 mM calcium chloride , 10 (cid:3) g / ml leupeptin , and 10 (cid:3) g / ml aprotinin . Tissue homogenates were allowed to sit on ice for 20 min and clariﬁed by centrifugation at 14 , 000 revolution / min for 10 min . The protein concentration in the superna - tant was then determined using the Bradford assay . All the samples were aliquoted and stored at (cid:2) 80°C to prevent freeze - thaw cycles . Immunoprecipitation and Western blot . Immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments were performed as described in our previ - ous studies ( 36 , 37 ) . 2 - Deoxyglucose uptake . Glucose uptake was performed as de - scribed previously ( 27 ) with some modiﬁcation . In brief , the Grb2 - suppressed and scramble control C 2 C 12 myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes . After serum starvation for 6 h , the cells were treated with or without 50 , 100 , or 200 nM insulin at 37°C for 30 min . Then cells were incubated in 0 . 5 ml transport solution containing 2 - deoxyl - D - 2 - [ 3 H ] - glucose ( 0 . 5 (cid:3) Ci / ml ; American Radiolabeled Chemicals , St . Louis , MO ) and 10 (cid:3) M 2 - deoxyglucose ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) at 37°C for 10 min . Cells were subsequently washed with cold PBS and lysed in 0 . 5 ml of 0 . 1 M NaOH . The nonspeciﬁc uptake was measured in the presence of 10 (cid:3) M cytochalasin B ( Sigma ) . Statistical analysis . All data are presented as the means (cid:6) SE and were analyzed by either the Student’s t - test or the ANOVA with post hoc Bonferoni test . P (cid:7) 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant . RESULTS CR markedly decreases Grb2 expression and enhances in - sulin signaling in mouse skeletal muscle . To determine the potential mechanism by which CR increases insulin sensitivity , we examined the effect of CR on the expression levels of components in the PI3K and p44 / 42 MAPK signaling path - ways of mice . Several insulin target tissues , including rectus femoris muscle , liver , and fat , were isolated from AL - fed and CR C57BL / 6 mice , and the expression of insulin signaling molecules in these tissues was determined by Western blot using speciﬁc antibodies . We found that CR had no effect on the expression levels of the IR , IRS - 1 , Akt , phosphoinositide - dependent protein kinase - 1 , and p44 / 42 MAPK ( data not shown ) . On the other hand , CR signiﬁcantly suppressed the expression of Grb2 in skeletal muscle ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) and white adipose tissue ( Fig . 1 , A and C ) , a key signaling molecule functioning in the p44 / 42 MAPK signaling pathway . There was no signiﬁcant difference in Grb2 levels in the liver between AL and CR mice ( data not shown ) . Consistent with previous ﬁndings that CR increases insulin signaling in the skeletal muscle ( 28 , 29 ) , we found that insulin - stimulated Akt phosphorylation was signiﬁcantly increased in skeletal muscle of the CR mice ( Fig . 1 , D and E ) . The insulin - stimulated p44 / 42 MAPK phosphorylation was also reduced in skeletal muscle of CR mice , but this difference did not reach signiﬁcance ( P (cid:8) 0 . 09 ) ( Fig . 1 , D and F ) . Reducing Grb2 expression levels inhibits IRS - 1 serine phos - phorylation and increases PI3K signaling . To determine whether Grb2 deﬁciency is sufﬁcient to affect insulin signaling , we E1068 GRB2 AND CALORIE RESTRICTION AJP - Endocrinol Metab • VOL 296 • MAY 2009 • www . ajpendo . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 6 on A ugu s t 28 , 2017 h tt p : / / a j pendo . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m generated stable C 2 C 12 cell lines in which the expression levels of Grb2 are greatly suppressed by RNAi ( Fig . 2 A , bottom blot ) . Scramble and Grb2 - suppressed C 2 C 12 myoblasts were pre - treated with or without the p44 / 42 MAPK inhibitor UO126 and then treated with or without insulin . Cells were lysed , and insulin - stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and p44 / 42 MAPK were determined by Western blot using phosphospeciﬁc anti - bodies . Suppression of Grb2 led to increased Akt phosphor - ylation ( Fig . 2 A , top blot , and Fig . 2 B ) , which is associated with increased IRS - 1 tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig . 2 , E and F ) . No signiﬁcant difference was observed in insulin - stimulated p44 / 42 MAPK phosphorylation between the scramble and the Grb2 - suppressed cells ( Fig . 2 A , middle and lower middle blots , and Fig . 2 C ) . Treating cells with the p44 / 42 MAPK inhibitor UO126 almost completely blocked insulin - stimulated phosphorylation of p44 / 42 MAPK ( Fig . 2 A , middle blot ) but had no signiﬁcant effect on insulin - stimulated Akt phosphorylation ( Fig . 2 A , top blot , and 2 B ) . Consistent with increased PI3K / Akt signaling , the insulin - stimulated glucose uptake was signiﬁcantly increased in the Grb2 - suppressed C 2 C 12 myotubes compared with scramble control cells ( Fig . 2 D ) . To elucidate the mechanism by which reducing Grb2 expression enhances PI3K signaling , we examined insulin - stimulated IRS - 1 serine phosphorylation in scramble and Grb2 - suppressed cells . We found that insulin treatment led to Fig . 1 . Effect of calorie restriction ( CR ) on Grb2 expression and insulin signaling in mouse tissues .

Insulin - stimulated serine phosphorylation at these sites was signiﬁcantly reduced in the Grb2 - suppressed cells com - pared with that in the scramble cells ( Fig . 2 , G – J ) . Taken together with the ﬁndings that IRS - 1 tyrosine phosphorylation and Akt phosphorylation at Thr 308 are enhanced in the Grb2 - suppressed cells ( Fig . 2 ) , these results suggest that reducing the negative feedback role of IRS - 1 serine phosphorylation may be the mechanism by which reducing Grb2 enhances insulin sensitivity . Reducing Grb2 ameliorates HFD - induced insulin resistance in vivo . To investigate whether reducing Grb2 expression levels affects insulin sensitivity in vivo , we fed the Grb2 (cid:1) / (cid:2) heterozygous knockout mice , which showed reduced Grb2 expression in skeletal muscle and liver ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) , with a HFD for 16 wk . The Grb2 (cid:1) / (cid:2) mice showed a reduced body weight increase compared with wild - type littermates under HFD feeding conditions ( Fig . 3 C ) . By performing the glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test , we found that the Grb2 (cid:1) / (cid:2) mice were more insulin sensitive compared with wild - type littermates under HFD - fed conditions ( Fig . 3 , D and E ) . Reducing Grb2 expression inhibits IRS - 1 serine phosphor - ylation and enhances insulin signaling in vivo . To determine whether reducing Grb2 expression levels affects insulin sig - naling in vivo , we examined the effect of HFD feeding on insulin - stimulated phosphorylation of Akt , IRS - 1 , and p44 / 42 MAPK in skeletal muscle of Grb2 (cid:1) / (cid:2) mice and their wild - type littermates . In agreement with the ﬁndings obtained from Grb2 - suppressed C 2 C 12 cells , insulin - stimulated IRS - tyrosine phosphorylation and Akt phosphorylation at Thr 308 were sig - niﬁcantly increased in the Grb2 (cid:1) / (cid:2) knockout mice compared with their wild - type littermates ( Fig . 4 , A – C ) . Reducing the expression levels of Grb2 decreased insulin - stimulated p44 / 42 MAPK phosphorylation , but the difference was not statistically signiﬁcant ( P (cid:8) 0 . 08 ) ( Fig . 4 , A and D ) . In addition , insulin - stimulated IRS - 1 Ser 612 phosphorylation was notably reduced in the Grb2 (cid:1) / (cid:2) knockout mice ( Fig . 4 , E and F ) .

However , although enhanced PI3K / Akt signaling has been implicated in improved insulin sensitivity on glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle of CR animals ( 15 , 29 , 30 ) , the underlying biochemical mechanisms remain largely unknown . We have found that CR greatly suppresses the expression levels of Grb2 in skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue ( Fig . 1 ) , a signaling molecule involved in the insulin - mediated p44 / 42 MAPK signaling pathway . On the basis of the ﬁndings that CR stimulates PI3K signaling in skeletal muscle ( 29 , 30 ) , we were interested in determining whether downregulation of Grb2 in mice provides a mechanism by which CR sensitizes Fig . 3 .

We found that insulin - stimulated IRS - 1 tyrosine phosphorylation and Akt phosphorylation were increased in Grb2 - suppressed C 2 C 12 cells ( Fig . 2 ) and in Grb2 (cid:1) / (cid:2) mice ( Fig . 4 ) . In addition , we found that reducing Grb2 expression levels enhanced insulin - stimulated Akt phosphorylation and insulin sensitivity in mice ( Figs . 3 and 4 ) . These results provide strong evidence that reducing Grb2 expression levels is beneﬁcial for insulin - stim - ulated PI3K signaling and action in vivo . Our results show that reducing Grb2 expression levels de - creased IRS - 1 serine phosphorylation in C 2 C 12 cells ( Fig . 2 , G – J ) and in skeletal muscle of mice ( Fig . 4 , E and F ) . These results suggest a potential mechanism by which reducing Grb2 levels leads to increased PI3K signaling . There are some data suggesting that p44 / 42 MAPK negatively regulates PI3K sig - naling by serine phosphorylation of IRS - 1 ( 6 , 12 , 20 , 21 ) . Several p44 / 42 MAPK - mediated phosphorylation sites includ - ing Ser 312 ( 12 ) , Ser 612 , and Ser 636 ( 6 ) have been identiﬁed in IRS - 1 . Thus reducing serine phosphorylation of IRS - 1 at these sites could be a mechanism by which CR sensitizes insulin signaling and action . Consistent with this view , the insulin - stimulated p44 / 42 MAPK phosphorylation in skeletal muscle was notably reduced in CR compared with the AL control mice though the reduction was not statistically signiﬁcant ( Fig . 1 , D and F ) . It is possible that the CR - associated reduction in p44 / 42 MAPK phosphorylation may reach statistical signiﬁ - cance with increased sample size , but another likely explana - tion for these ﬁndings is that additional mechanisms , in addi - tion to or other than reducing p44 / 42 MAPK activity , may be involved in the insulin - sensitizing effect of CR in mice . Sev - eral serine kinases such as the JNK ( 1 , 25 ) , IKK ( 17 ) , and PKC - (cid:9) ( 18 , 39 ) have been found to negatively regulate insulin - stimulated PI3K signaling by serine phosphorylation of IRS - 1 / 2 . Future studies will be needed to determine whether the expression and / or kinase activity of these kinases are down - regulated in Grb2 - deﬁcient cells or mice . In summary , our results show that CR reduces the expres - sion levels of Grb2 in skeletal muscle , which potentiates insulin - stimulated Akt phosphorylation . We have also found that downregulation of Grb2 increases insulin - induced glucose uptake in C 2 C 12 muscle cells and insulin sensitivity in mice . Our results show that CR or Grb2 downregulation reduces IRS - 1 serine phosphorylation and increases IRS - 1 tyrosine phosphorylation , suggesting a potential mechanism underlying increased insulin sensitivity in the CR or Grb2 (cid:1) / (cid:2) mice . Since activation of PI3K signaling is essential for regulation of glucose metabolism , these ﬁndings suggest a potential mech - anism by which CR increases insulin sensitivity to regulate glucose homeostasis in skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue in mice .
