However , the underlying mechanisms that couple mechanosensing by B cells to 18 antigen extraction and processing remain poorly understood . 19 We show that B cells activated by antigens associated with stiffer substrates exhibit enhanced 20 spreading responses and higher tubulin acetylation at the center of the immune synapse , where 21 less motile lysosomes preferentially localize . This process is coupled to the translocation of the 22 microtubule acetylase , ATAT1 to the cytoplasm of B cells , which occurs as a mechano - 23 response during BCR stimulation . Accordingly , B cells silenced for ATAT1 are unable to 24 stabilize lysosomes at the synaptic interface and display a lower capacity to extract and present 25 immobilized antigens to T cells . 26 Overall , these findings highlight how BCR - dependent mechano - responses trigger microtubule 27 network modifications to precisely orchestrate lysosome positioning to promote antigen 28 extraction and presentation in B cells . 29 Introduction 30 Mechanosensing is a fundamental cellular process that enables cells to perceive and respond to 31 physical environmental cues ( Shaheen et al . , 2019 ) . This ability allows cells to adapt to tissue 32 geometry and stiffness ( also referred to as rigidity , measured in kPa ) , which in turn can 33 influence genetic reprogramming , cell adhesion , migration , and organelle function ( Chen et 34 al . , 2017 ) . How mechanical cues associated with antigen recognition by B cells dictate their 35 activation remains unresolved . 36 B lymphocytes interact with antigens that display diverse mechanical properties , ranging from 37 less stiff immune complexes to highly rigid viral capsids ( ~ 100 MPa ) ( Shaheen et al . , 2019 ) . 38 Additionally , antigens can be recognized in a soluble form , considered to be in an environment 39 with extremely low stiffness ( 0 . 01 kPa ) , or tethered to membranes of antigen - presenting cells 40 ( APC ) , which display stiffness values of approximately 0 . 1 - 0 . 5 kPa . B cells can also capture 41 antigens associated with the extracellular matrix with rigidities of ~ 20 kPa ( Ciechomska et al . , 42 2014 ) . Moreover , the physical cues arising from membranes can change upon inflammatory 43 conditions modifying the stiffness of the plasma membrane from the presenting cell ( Bufi et 44 al . , 2015 ; Kim et al . , 2019 ) . Consequently , external physical cues emerge as an additional layer 45 of information that B lymphocytes can sense and thereby impact their responses . Both B and 46 T cells display membrane - bound immunoglobulin receptors , the BCR and T cell receptor 47 ( TCR ) , which possess the ability to sense the mechanical properties of their ligands ( Zhu , Chen 48 and Ju , 2019 ; Zhu et al . , 2019 ) . Additionally , B cells activated on stiff surfaces exhibit 49 augmented BCR clustering and downstream signaling ( Wan et al . , 2013 ) , leading to enhanced 50 spreading responses and actin cytoskeletal rearrangements . Whether this has an impact on the 51 capacity of B cells to extract and present antigens acquired at the immune synapse ( IS ) is 52 unknown . 53 The mode of antigen extraction used by B cells depends on the physical properties of the 54 substrate in which antigens are presented : antigens on flexible , softer surfaces are internalized 55 into clathrin - coated pits by Myosin IIA - mediated pulling forces that trigger invagination of 56 antigen - containing membranes ( Hoogeboom and Tolar , 2016 ) . During this process , the 57 complexes formed by the B cell receptor and the antigen ( BCR - Ag complexes ) are internalized 58 at regions enriched in actin foci ( Roper et al . , 2019 ) . On the other hand , antigens presented on 59 more rigid surfaces require the local fusion of lysosomes at the synaptic membrane that release 60 proteases and acidify the synaptic cleft , facilitating antigen extraction ( Yuseff et al . , 2011 ) . 61 This proteolytic mode of antigen extraction relies on the precise positioning , tethering and 62 secretion of lysosomes at the IS . Various factors regulate this process , including local actin 63 cytoskeleton remodeling by proteasome activity ( Ibañez - Vega , Del Valle Batalla , et al . , 2019 ) , 64 proper assembly of the exocyst complex ( Sáez et al . , 2019 ) , and the v - Snare VAMP7 to the 65 plasma membrane ( Obino et al . , 2017 ) . 66 Both cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells enhance perforin - mediated killing at the immune 67 synapse when interacting with antigens associated to stiff substrates ( Basu et al . , 2016 ) , 68 suggesting that lytic granule secretion is coupled to mechanosensing ( Friedman et al . , 2021 ) . 69 However , the underlying mechanisms behind this process remain largely unknown . In other 70 cell types , the rigidity of the environment regulates membrane trafficking through integrin and 71 RhoA - dependent remodeling the actin cytoskeleton to promote docking of secretory vesicles 72 ( Lachowski et al . , 2022 ; Phuyal et al . , 2022 ) . Notably , the role of mechanosensing in directing 73 lysosome positioning has not been previously characterized and B cells emerge as a valuable 74 model to study this process . 75 Vesicles move along microtubules ( MT ) by their association to motor proteins , which can be 76 regulated by post - translational modifications ( PTM ) of the microtubule network ( Pu et al . , 77 2016 ) . In neurons , acetylation of microtubules fine - tunes the trafficking of lysosomes by 78 modifying their affinity with kinesins ( Morelli et al . , 2018 ) . In T cells , upregulation of tubulin 79 acetylation by inhibition of the deacetylase HDAC6 leads to impaired transport of lytic 80 granules to the synaptic membrane interacting with the target cell , highlighting how 81 microtubule PTM , in particular acetylation , impact vesicle transport ( Núñez - Andrade et al . , 82 2016 ) . 83 Thus , mechano - responses can regulate MT posttranslational modifications of the microtubule 84 network , resulting in differential trafficking of vesicles to sites where membrane exchange or 85 exocytosis is required . Interestingly , acetylation of tubulin can also be coupled to mechano - 86 responses and is significantly enhanced at the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts when 87 traction forces occur , promoting the release of GEF - H1 and acto - myosin contractibility 88 ( Seetharaman et al . , 2022 ) . In this work , we show that activation of B cells on stiffer substrates 89 enhances the concentration of lysosomes at the center of the IS and ultimately improves their 90 capacity to extract and present antigens . This process relies on increasing levels of tubulin 91 acetylation in response to stiffness and the translocation of the acetylase ATAT1 from the 92 nucleus to the cytoplasm . Elucidating how physical properties of antigen presenting surfaces 93 are coupled to B cell effector responses that drive antigen extraction , processing and 94 presentation , may provide valuable therapeutic tools for vaccine design , drug delivery or 95 treatment of autoimmune diseases . 96 Materials and methods 97 Cell lines , culture , and treatments 98 In this study we used the mouse A20 lymphoma cell line , an FcγR - defective B cell line with 99 the phenotype of quiescent mature B - cells , and the LMR7 . 5 Lack T - cell hybridoma , which 100 recognizes I - Ad - LACK156 – 173 complexes . Both cell lines were cultured as previously 101 described ( Sáez et al . , 2019 ) in CLICK medium ( RPMI 1640 , 10 % fetal bovine serum , 102 100U / mL penicillin - streptomycin , 0 . 1 % β - mercaptoethanol , and 2 % sodium pyruvate ) . 103 For the induction of tubulin acetylation , cells were treated with 1 uM of the microtubule - 104 stabilizing agent SAHA ( TOCRIS bioscience Cat . No . 149647 - 78 - 9 ) for 30 minutes before 105 activation or experimental procedures . For time - lapse acquisitions , lysosomes were labeled 106 with Lysotracker DN - 99 Red ( Thermo Scientific , L7528 ) . 107 Preparation of tunable - stiffness poly - acrylamide ( PAA ) gels 108 For preparing the tunable - stiffness PAA gels , two sets of coverslips are used : a silanized - 109 bottom coverslip where the PAA gel is immobilized and an smaller impermeabilized coverslip 110 on top to create a “sandwich” to allow for the polymerization of the PAA gel ( Charrier et al . , 111 2020 ) . Bottom coverslips are activated with a 2 % 3 - Aminopropyltrimethoxysilane ( 3 - APTMS ) 112 ( Sigma Aldrich 13822 - 56 - 5 ) in 96 % ethanol solution for 5 minutes and washed with 70 % 113 ethanol . The top coverslips are siliconized or waterproofed with Rain - X . The coverslips are 114 then washed with ultrapure water , dried well , and moved to the next stage . 115 The following reagents were used to prepare the PAA gels : 2 % bis solution ( Bio - Rad 116 # 1610142 ) , 40 % acrylamide ( Bio - Rad # 1610140 ) , 10 % APS in 10 mM HEPES solution , and 117 TEMED ( Table 1 ) . 118 119 kPa 40 % Acrylamide ( μL ) 2 % Bis - Acrylamide ( μL ) 10 % APS ( μL ) TEMED ( μL ) 1X PBS ( μL ) Total ( uL ) 0 . 3 75 30 10 1 895 1011 13 233 , 75 125 6 , 25 1 , 8 883 1249 Table 1 : preparation of poly - acrylamide gels of 0 . 3 ( soft ) and 13 ( stiff ) kPa . 120 To prepare the gel , 9 uL of the gel solution was pipetted onto the center of the bottom coverslip . 121 Then , it was well covered with the smaller cover and pressed gently until the mix spread 122 outwards . After 30 minutes of polymerization , they were covered with aluminum foil . Next , 123 1X PBS was added to carefully remove the top cover . The gel can be stored in fresh 1X PBS 124 at 4ºC overnight and used within 48 hours . 125 For conjugation with ligands a solution of 0 . 5 mg / mL SULFO - SANPAH ( Pierce , Thermo - 126 Scientific # A35395 ) in HEPES buffer 10 mM was prepared . PBS was removed from the gels 127 and immediately coated with SULFO - SANPAH at room temperature ( RT ) . Gels were exposed 128 to 365 nm UV light ( Maestrogen UV illuminator MLB - 16 ) for 10 minutes and washed with 129 1X PBS thrice . Finally , a BCR + ligand ( F ( ab′ ) 2 goat anti - mouse IgG ) ( Jackson 130 ImmunoResearch , 115 - 006 - 146 ) was added to coat the gels at a concentration of 0 . 13 mg / mL 131 and incubated overnight . This was followed by 3 washes with 1X PBS and immediately used 132 for experiments or stored at 4ºC protected from light for no more than 48 hr . 133 134 Activation and immunofluorescence of B cells on PAA gels 135 80 μL of B cells ( 1 . 0 x 10 6 cells / mL in CLICK medium with 5 % FBS ) were seeded onto an 136 antigen ( BCR ligand + ) - coated gel for different time points in a cell incubator at 37 °C / 5 % 137 CO 2 . After each time point , the media was carefully aspirated off each PAA gel , and 100 μL 138 of cold 1X PBS was added to stop the activation . PBS was removed , and each PAA gel was 139 fixed with 50 μL of 3 % PFA for 10 min at RT . PAA gels were washed three times with 1X 140 PBS . The 1X PBS was removed , and 50 μL of blocking buffer ( 2 % BSA and 0 . 3 M glycine in 141 1X PBS ) was added to each coverslip . 142 Primary antibodies were diluted in permeabilization buffer ( 0 . 2 % BSA and 0 . 05 % saponin in 143 1X PBS ) and incubated by adding 40 uL over the gels in a humid chamber at 4 °C overnight . 144 The plate was sealed to avoid evaporation of the antigen solution . Gels were washed three times 145 with permeabilization buffer . Secondary antibodies or dyes were diluted in permeabilization 146 buffer , using 40 μL per PAA gel , and incubated for 1h at RT in dark and humid chambers . The 147 PAA gels were washed twice with permeabilization buffer and once with 1X PBS . The PBS 148 solution was removed from the coverslips . 8 μL of mounting reagent was added to a microscope 149 slide . The PAA gels were mounted onto the slide with the cell side facing down . The slides 150 were allowed to dry for 30 min at 37 °C or RT overnight protected from light . 151 152 Immunoblot 153 Cells were lysed with 40 uL of RIPA buffer , then supernatants of samples were collected and 154 loaded onto gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane ( Trans - Blot Semi - Dry 155 Transfer Cell ; Bio - Rad ) . Membranes were blocked in 2 % BSA / TBS + 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 and 156 incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies , followed by 60 - min incubation with 157 secondary antibodies . Western blots were developed with Westar Supernova substrate 158 ( Cyanagen , Cat . No . XLS3 , 0100 ) , and chemiluminescence was detected using the iBright 159 imager ( Thermo Fischer ) . 160 161 Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) 162 The elastic modulus of the PAA gels ( Young ' s modulus , E ) was assessed using a JPK 163 NanoWizard with a CellHesion module mounted on a Carl Zeiss confocal microscope , Zeiss 164 LSM510 ( AFM ; JPK instruments ) , and silicon nitride cantilevers ( spring constant : 1 Nm −1 , 165 spherical 10 μm diameter tip ; Novascan Technologies ) . The cantilever spring constant and 166 deflection sensitivity were calibrated in fluid using the thermal noise method ( Hutter and 167 Bechhoefer , 1993 ) . 168 Force measurements were then conducted at different locations ( 0 . 5 mm apart in x and y 169 coordinates ) within the region of interest . In each location , nine indentations distributed in a 170 3×3 point grid ( 30 μm × 30 μm ) were performed . The elastic modulus for each force curve was 171 calculated using JPK data processing software ( JPK DP version 4 . 2 ) , assuming a Hertz impact 172 model . 173 Antibodies & dyes 174 For primary antibodies , we used Rat anti - mouse LAMP1 ( BD Bioscience , # 553792 ) , Rabbit 175 anti - mouse Acetyl - Tubulin ( Lys40 , D20G3 ) ( Cell Signaling , # 5335 ) , Rabbit anti - mouse 176 αTubulin ( Abcam , # ab6160 ) , Goat anti - mouse IgM Fab2 ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) , Rabbit 177 anti mouse GEF - H1 ( Abcam # ab155785 ) , Rabbit anti - mouse ATAT1 ( Thermo Scientific , 178 # PA5 - 114922 ) , Rabbit anti - mouse YAP ( D8H1X ) XP ( Cell Signaling # 14074 ) . For secondary 179 antibodies : Donkey anti - rabbit IgG - Alexa 488 / 546 / 647 ( Jackson Immunoresearch , 711 - 546 - 180 152 ) , Donkey anti - rat IgG - Alexa 488 / 546 / 647 ( Jackson Immunoresearch , 712 - 166 - 153 ) , 181 Phalloidin Rhodamine ( Thermo Scientific , R415 ) , Lysotracker - red DND 99 ( Thermo 182 Scientific , L7528 ) and Hoescht ( Abcam , # ab228551 ) . 183 Cell transfection and electroporation 184 The Nucleofector R T16 ( Lonza , Gaithersburg , MD ) was used to electroporate 4 x 10 6 A20 B 185 cells with 3 μg of plasmid DNA using the LC - 013 program . After transfection , cells were 186 cultured for 18 ±2 hrs at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 before functional analysis . For ATAT1 silencing , 187 cells were electroporated with 100 nM of siRNA ( sc - 108799 - SH , Santa - cruz technology ) or 188 100 nM of siRNA control ( sc - 37007 , Santa - cruz technology ) . 189 190 Antigen presentation assay 191 Antigen presentation assays were performed as previously described on ( Yuseff et al . , 2011 ) 192 with modifications . Briefly , B cells were incubated with either Lack - BCR - Ligand or BCR 193 Ligand coated PAA gels and PAA gels with different concentrations of Lack peptide ( Lack 194 156 - 173 ) for 1h . Then cells were washed with PBS and incubated with Lack - specific LMR 24 195 7 . 5 T Cells in a 1 : 1 ratio for 4h in a cell incubator at 37ºC and 5 % CO 2 . Supernatants were 196 collected , and interleukin - 2 cytokine production was measured using BD optiEA Mouse IL - 2 197 ELISA set following the manufacturer’s instructions ( BD Biosciences , Cat no . 555148 ) . 198 199 Cell imaging and image analysis 200 For widefield imaging , all Z - stack images were obtained with 0 . 3 μm between slices . Images 201 were acquired in a widefield - epifluorescence microscope ( Nikon Ti Eclipse ) with an 202 X60 / 1 . 25NA objective . For confocal acquisition , images were obtained in a Zeiss LSM880 203 Confocal with Airyscan detection microscope using a 63X / 1 . 4NA oil immersion lens , with a 204 Z - stack configuration of 0 . 2 μm . All acquisition for experiment replicates were performed with 205 same mW / cm 2 intensity for all illumination or equivalent exposition . The images were 206 processed using Zeiss Black Zen software for Airyscan processing and analyzed with Fiji 207 ( ImageJ ) ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . 208 For image analysis , when quantifying cell spreading a threshold mask ( Otsu ) was used in 209 parallel with manual segmentation in instances when automatic algorithms were not able to 210 resolve general actin structures . For actin foci quantification , we performed analysis of 211 particles that were found inside previously detected spreading cells . In this case , we took into 212 account workflows that have been tested for determining such structures ( Roper et al . , 2019 ) . 213 Other spot segmentation and cluster determination algorithms such as lysosome number at the 214 IS , their size and pFAK counts were carried out with conservative algorithms of background 215 subtraction and the same strategies of segmentation for each experimental set . Lysosome 216 dynamics was studied with Fiji’s TrackMate plugin using the LAP tracker in settings 217 recommended for its unsupervised setting , always testing for quality score of tracks . Overlap 218 coefficients for colocalization and fluorescence ratios were determined by quantification of the 219 mean fluorescence intensity of segmented structures and for single planes of acquisition at the 220 IS plane ( closest z plane to the PAA gel surface ) . Specifically , for colocalization analysis only 221 single planes and individual regions of interest of the single cells were used and quantified with 222 JaCoP plugin for Fiji software following its instructions . Determination of the localization 223 index for differential accumulation of lysosomes in central or peripheral zones of the cell , was 224 adapted from previous publications ( Ibañez - Vega , Fuentes , et al . , 2019 ) . Nuclear and 225 cytoplasmic accumulation was calculated following “Cyt / Nuc” plugin for Fiji ( Grune et al . , 226 2018 ) . 227 Statistical analysis 228 229 All data presented was tested for normality and homoscedasticity ; accordingly , appropriate 230 statistical tests were applied considering those factors . Data in plots and graphs are expressed 231 as fold change of mean or mean ± SEM . If corresponding , experiments were analyzed by 232 Student’s t - test or Mann – Whitney test following Gaussian and non - Gaussian distribution , 233 respectively after performing d’Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test . In cases where 234 two conditions are shown , two - way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparison test was 235 performed if data followed normal distribution . When datasets followed non - gaussian 236 distributions , Kruskal - Wallis tests were applied with Dunn’s a - posteriori multi comparison 237 examination . Experiments were carried out with a sum of n ≥ 30 cells pooled from N = 3 238 biological replicates . Error bars shown are mean ± SEM . Statistical analysis was performed 239 with Prism ( GraphPad Software ) and RStudio . For significance , p - values were calculated using 240 different tests mentioned above and are illustrated in each figure . 241 Results and discussion 242 243 The rigidity of the antigen - associated surface regulates actin remodeling and 244 spreading responses in B cells 245 246 Upon interaction with surface - tethered antigens , B cells trigger a spreading response to 247 maximize antigen encounter and uptake ( Yuseff et al . , 2013 ) . In this study , we aimed to 248 characterize cytoskeletal and vesicular responses coupled to mechanical cues sensed through 249 the B cell receptor ( BCR ) . 250 To examine this , B cells were activated for different time points on surfaces containing BCR 251 ligands associated to polyacrylamide ( PAA ) gels of 0 . 3 and 13 kPa , hereafter referred to as 252 " soft " and " stiff " gels , respectively ( Fig . EV1 A ) . The stiffness of the gels was measured by 253 atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and values obtained for soft and stiff gels ( Fig . EV1 B ) were 254 consistent with previous reports . These mimicked physiological and pathological mechanical 255 cues ( Wan et al . , 2013 ) . BCR + ligands ( F ( ab′ ) 2 anti - IgG ) coupled to both soft and stiff gels 256 exhibited similar binding densities ( Fig . EV1 C ) and formed a continuous and homogeneous 257 layer under all conditions . 258 B cells seeded onto gels of different stiffness , without BCR + ligands exhibited no alterations in 259 cell spreading after 5 and 30 minutes ( Fig . EV1 D - E ) . Conversely , B cells seeded over stiff 260 substrates containing BCR + ligands , exhibited higher spreading responses after 15 and 30 261 minutes , in comparison with those seeded over softer substrates ( Fig . 1A ) . Mean areas of B 262 cells activated under stiff conditions were in the range of 300 - 400  m 2 compared to an average 263 of 100  m 2 for B cells activated under soft conditions ( Fig 1B ) . These observations suggest 264 that B cells possess a BCR - dependent mechanosensing pathway that controls cell spreading in 265 response to substrate rigidity coupled to BCR + ligands . 266 Additionally , when examining actin cytoskeleton organization in these cells , we observed an 267 increase in the number of actin foci and lamellipodia area ( Figs . 1C , D insets A and B 268 respectively ) in B cells activated on stiffer substrates compared to soft substrates . Actin foci 269 structures are considered a hallmark of B cell mechano - responses by engaging on inward forces 270 that facilitate antigen concentration and internalization ( Roper et al . , 2019 ) . These results 271 support the idea that mechanical cues shape the activation of B cells , impacting the structure 272 of the actin cytoskeleton , prompting us to explore how B cells couple the detection of physical 273 cues during B cell activation to regulate antigen extraction and presentation . 274 B cells elict mechanotransduction pathways during activation as a response to 275 variable substrate stiffness . 276 Until now , our results reveal that during activation , B cells remodel their actin cytoskeleton in 277 response to external physical cues . The focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) is involved in 278 mechanosensitive responses , promoting the assembly of focal adhesions to support membrane 279 protrusion during cell spreading and migration ( Li et al . , 2023 ) . In B cells the phosphorylated 280 active form of FAK ( pFAK ) is increased upon BCR stimulation in an integrin - independent 281 manner known as “inside - out activation” through phosphorylation by PKCb ( Shaheen et al . , 282 2017 ) . Thus , we next sought to determine whether in our model B cells could promote FAK 283 activation in response to substrate stiffness . Our results show that B cells activated on stiff 284 surfaces display increased levels of pFAK , observed as individual spots , in comparison to soft 285 conditions ( Fig . 1E - F ) . pFAK spot number was upregulated at earlier time points of activation 286 ( 5 to 15 minutes ) and decreased after 30 minutes . We confirmed this by immunoblot analysis , 287 which showed higher levels of pFAK in cell lysates from B cells activated on stiffer substrates 288 at similar time points ( Fig . EV1 F - G ) . 289 We also verified that B cells induce stronger BCR signaling responses when activated on stiffer 290 versus soft substrates ( Fig . EV2 A ) . After 15 minutes of activation , B cells activated on stiffer 291 substrates displayed higher levels of phospho - AKT and phospho - ERK in comparison to softer 292 conditions ( Fig . EV2 B ) . Taken together , these findings show that BCR - mediated 293 mechanosensing in response to substrate stiffness activates FAK and BCR downstream 294 signaling molecules that regulate spreading and signaling pathways associated with enhanced 295 states of B cell activation . 296 Tubulin acetylation is enhanced in a mechanosensory - dependent manner during 297 B cell activation . 298 During engagement with antigens , B cells remodel their actin cytoskeleton according to 299 external mechanical cues ; however , the impact of such cues on lysosome trafficking have not 300 been addressed . 301 Intracellular trafficking relies on the organization of the MT network , where posttranslational 302 modifications of tubulin can tune MT dynamics and impact vesicle transport ( Janke and 303 Magiera , 2020 ) . Acetylation of alpha tubulin at lysine 40 stabilizes the tubulin lattice , and 304 ensures the accumulation of KIF proteins that promote synaptic vesicle transport in neurons 305 ( Bhuwania , Castro - Castro and Linder , 2014 ) . Whether physical cues regulate lysosome 306 transport at the IS by modifying microtubule PTMs remained to be determined . Thus , we 307 evaluated if acetylation of the MT network is regulated by physical cues sensed by B cells 308 through their BCR . To this end , B cells were seeded over soft or stiff BCR + - coupled PAA gels 309 for 5 , 15 and 30 minutes and stained for alpha tubulin ( a - Tub ) and acetylated tubulin ( Ac - Tub ) . 310 Noticeably , B cells activated on stiff surfaces displayed higher levels of Ac - Tub compared to 311 cells activated on soft substrates ( Fig . 2A ) , which was measured as the total amount of Ac - 312 tubulin and as a ratio to total tubulin levels ( Fig . 2 B - C ) . This result was confirmed by western 313 blot analysis of cell lysates from B cells activated on stiff and soft substrates , showing that 314 levels of Ac - Tub were upregulated in a time and stiffness - dependent manner ( Fig EV2 C - D ) . 315 Mechano - responses to substrate rigidity by other cell types during adhesion and migration 316 involve microtubule acetylation , which promotes the release of GEF - H1 from microtubules 317 into the cytoplasm to increase Rho activity and cell contractility ( Seetharaman et al . , 2022 ) . 318 We therefore evaluated levels and localization the Rho - GTPase GEF - H1 , which is released 319 from acetylated microtubules upon BCR activation and interacts with the exocyst complex to 320 promote lysosome tethering at the immune synapse ( Sáez et al . , 2019 ) . By using the 321 experimental setup described above , we observed that B cells interacting with stiffer substrates , 322 displayed higher levels of GEF - H1 at the IS plane compared to cells activated on soft substrates 323 ( Fig EV2 E - F ) . This result is consistent with B cells progressively enhancing the acetylation of 324 tubulin at the IS interface upon stimulation with stiffer substrates . Collectively , these findings 325 strongly support the notion that B cells respond to physical cues by enhancing tubulin 326 acetylation , which is coupled to the accumulation of GEF - H1 at the synaptic membrane , 327 previously shown to promote lysosome tethering at this interface . Therefore , we next evaluated 328 whether this mechanosensory response directly impacts lysosome trafficking at the immune 329 synapse of B cells . 330 Substrate stiffness regulates lysosome positioning and dynamics at the IS 331 To assess whether physical cues sensed by B cells have an impact on lysosome positioning , we 332 seeded B cells on soft or stiff substrates containing BCR + ligands , at increasing time points . 333 Cells were then stained for the lysosomal marker LAMP1 together with an actin cytoskeleton 334 marker and imaged using confocal microscopy ( Fig . 3 A ) . The distribution of LAMP1 + vesicles 335 within the intracellular space , defined by cortical actin cytoskeleton was analyzed as follows : 336 the total cell area was divided into 3 equally concentric sections ( Fig . EV2 G ) and raw intensity 337 fluorescence values obtained were normalized with respect to the spreading area of each cell . 338 As shown in Fig . 3B , cells stimulated on stiffer surfaces exhibited increased accumulation of 339 lysosomes at the IS , after 15 minutes of activation compared to softer substrates . The amount 340 of lysosomes at the center of the IS was comparable in both conditions after 30 minutes of 341 activation . However , the number of lysosomes at the cell periphery was lower in B cells 342 interacting with stiffer substrates , suggesting that the lysosomes are retained more efficiently 343 at the center of the synaptic plane in B cells activated by antigens associated to surfaces with 344 higher stiffness ( Fig . 3B ) . 345 Additionally , we quantified the number of LAMP1 + particles at the z - plane juxtaposed to the 346 antigen - coated surface ( Fig . EV3 A . ) in B cells interacting with soft or stiff substrates . As 347 expected , we found more lysosomes at the IS plane of B cells activated onto stiffer substrates . 348 Interestingly , B cells on stiffer gels and increasing activation times displayed smaller 349 lysosomes compared to cells activated on softer substrates ( Fig . EV3 B ) . This could result from 350 changes in lysosome fusion or fission dynamics mediated by mechanical cues that remain to 351 be explored . We next evaluated how substrate stiffness sensed by B cells regulates lysosome 352 dynamics . To this end , B cells labelled with lysotracker were seeded on soft or stiff substrates 353 coupled to BCR + ligands and live imaging was performed for 5 - 20 minutes , an adequate time 354 frame to evaluate lysosome dynamics during the IS formation ( Sáez et al . , 2019 ) . Consistent 355 with results obtained in fixed cells , lysosomes preferentially accumulated to the cell center 356 upon activation under stiff conditions , whereas in softer substrates , lysosomes were evenly 357 dispersed ( Fig . EV3 C ) . When comparing the mean speed and displacement of lysosomes at 358 the IS , we found that in B cells seeded onto stiffer substrates , both values were lower compared 359 to softer ones ( Fig . EV3 D ) , confirming that lysosome motility and positioning are tuned by 360 extracellular physical cues during B cell activation . 361 To investigate the functional impact of MT acetylation on lysosome dynamics , we first 362 evaluated the co - localization of Ac - tubulin and LAMP1 in B cells activated on soft and stiff 363 substrates . Our results show that in B cells seeded on stiff substrates , lysosomes progressively 364 increased their co - localization with Ac - tubulin ( Fig . 3 C - D ) , whereas this parameter remained 365 constant in B cells activated on soft substrates . These results suggest that there is a functional 366 link between microtubule acetylation during B cell mechano - responses and the positioning of 367 lysosomes at the IS during B cell activation . 368 To precisely determine the effect of tubulin acetylation on lysosome dynamics in B cells , we 369 evaluated the effect of SAHA , which enhances tubulin acetylation by inhibiting the deacetylase 370 enzyme HDAC6 ( Sáez et al . , 2019 ) . Treatment with 1 μM SAHA for 30 min effectively led to 371 enhanced MT acetylation in B cells ( Fig . EV3 E - F ) . Next , lysotracker - labeled cells were 372 activated on stiff and soft surfaces for 15 min and imaged during 5 min at 3 seconds per frame . 373 Lysosome trajectories from each cell under different conditions were acquired and analyzed . 374 Our results show that lysosomes from SAHA - treated B cells activated on soft substrates , 375 exhibited lower mean speed and were more confined compared to lysosomes from non - treated 376 cells , displaying parameters similar to lysosomes from B cells activated on stiff substrates ( Fig . 377 3 E - F ) . Interestingly , treatment with SAHA had no significant effect on lysosome dynamics in 378 B cells activated on stiff substrates , indicating that the level of tubulin acetylation or the 379 threshold of tubulin acetylation to control lysosome mobility and positioning achieved by B 380 cells activated on stiff substrates cannot be further increased by inhibiting HDAC6 . Overall , 381 this result suggests that tubulin acetylation directly impacts lysosome dynamics in B cells as a 382 response to extracellular stiffness . 383 ATAT1 translocates to the Cytoplasm of B cells activated on stiff surfaces . 384 The impact of tubulin acetylation on lysosome dynamics prompted us to investigate the 385 regulatory mechanisms controlling this process . Tubulin acetylation is catalyzed by the 386 acetylase enzyme ATAT1 , which shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm ( Deb Roy et al . , 387 2022 ) . Given that tubulin acetylation is enhanced in response to substrate stiffness during B 388 cell activation , we explored whether this was coupled to changes in the localization of ATAT1 . 389 To address this , we seeded B cells in soft and stiff substrates and evaluated the localization of 390 ATAT1 by confocal microscopy after different time points of activation . With increasing times 391 of activation and stiffness , ATAT1 shifts from the nucleus to the cytoplasm , which was not 392 observed in B cells activated on soft substrates ( Fig . 4 A , B ) , supporting our hypothesis that 393 BCR - mediated mechanosensing enhances tubulin acetylation by promoting the cytoplasmic 394 localization of ATAT1 . To confirm that B cells elicit mechanosensory responses , we show that 395 YES - associated - protein ( YAP ) , a canonical marker of mechanosensing , is translocated to the 396 nucleus in B cells activated on substrates with higher stiffness ( Fig . 4 C , D ) similarly to other 397 cell types ( Panciera et al . , 2017 ) . 398 ATAT1 regulates lysosome dynamics . 399 To formally show that ATAT1 - dependent microtubule acetylation regulates lysosome 400 dynamics in B cells , we silenced ATAT1 expression using siRNA and evaluated its effect over 401 tubulin acetylation and lysosome distribution . B cells activated on soft substrates display low 402 levels of tubulin acetylation , therefore , to confirm the effect of ATAT1 silencing , we quantified 403 microtubule acetylation in B cells activated on stiff substrates . To this end , B cells were seeded 404 over stiff plastic plates coupled to BCR + or BCR - ligands for 30 minutes . As expected , levels 405 of acetylated tubulin were dramatically reduced upon silencing of ATAT1 compared to control 406 conditions ( Fig . EV4 A - B ) , confirming the role of ATAT1 in this process . Interestingly , cells 407 activated over stiff substrates exhibited greater tubulin acetylation when in contact with BCR + 408 ligands than in control ( BCR - ) conditions ( Fig . EV4 A - B ) . These findings provide additional 409 evidence for the mechanosensing role of the BCR and its link to tubulin acetylation upon its 410 stimulation . 411 We next analyzed the effect of silencing ATAT1 in lysosome positioning in B cells forming an 412 immune synapse . To this end , B cells were labeled for LAMP1 in ATAT1 - silenced and control 413 cells ( Fig . 4E , Fig . EV4 C - D ) and their distribution at the IS upon stimulation in stiff or soft 414 substrates was analyzed . As anticipated , ATAT1 - silenced B cells activated onto stiff substrates , 415 were unable to accumulate lysosomes at the center of the IS after 30 minutes ( Fig . 4F ) . 416 Silencing ATAT1 also decreased pFAK levels ( Fig . EV4 E - F ) at later time points of activation 417 in B cells seeded onto stiff substrates , suggesting an interplay between the formation of nascent 418 focal adhesions and tubulin acetylation , which could involve the release of actin - factors such 419 as GEF - H1 from the lumen of microtubules when they are acetylated . 420 Overall , these results reveal that impairing tubulin acetylation by silencing ATAT1 results in 421 defective lysosome positioning at the IS . Hence , ATAT1 - mediated tubulin acetylation emerges 422 as a mechanism for controlling the correct positioning and dynamics of lysosomes at the IS in 423 response to external physical cues . 424 The efficiency of antigen presentation by B cells depends on substrate stiffness and 425 ATAT1 . 426 A fundamental step in B cell activation is the capacity of these cells to present external antigens 427 as peptides loaded on MHC class II molecules to T cells . This enables B - T cooperation and 428 provides survival signals for B cells to sustain their maturation and differentiation into plasma 429 cells ( Akkaya , Kwak and Pierce , 2020 ) . To directly evaluate whether physical cues regulate 430 the capacity of B cell to extract and present antigens , B cells were seeded over substrates of 431 different stiffness containing BCR + ligands together with the LACK antigen from Leishmania 432 major . The ability of the cells to present MHC - II – LACK processed peptide complexes derived 433 from the substrates to a specific T cell hybridoma that recognizes processed antigen was 434 measured by monitoring IL - 2 secretion by activated T lymphocytes . Importantly , we included 435 a positive control for extreme stiffness ( glass ) coupled to BCR + or BCR - ligands . 436 As shown in Fig . 5 A , B cells seeded on immobilized antigens associated to stiffer substrates , 437 triggered higher IL - 2 production from T cells in comparison with B cells activated on soft 438 substrates . This suggests a positive correlation between substrate stiffness , the presence of an 439 activating BCR ligand , and the capacity of B cells to extract , process , and present antigens to 440 T cells . Increasing levels of stiffness had no effect on the presentation of the LACK 156 - 173 441 peptide , showing that varying substrate rigidity does not significantly influence T cell 442 responses or B - T cell interactions ( Fig . 5 B ) . 443 Having shown that physical cues from the environment regulate the capacity of B cells to 444 extract and present immobilized antigens , we next evaluated whether this relied on ATAT1 - 445 dependent microtubule acetylation . For this purpose , B cells were silenced for ATAT1 and 446 their capacity to extract and present antigens was assessed using the aforementioned 447 experimental setup . As shown in Fig . 4 C , the capacity to present Lack antigen associated to 448 stiff substrates was lower in ATAT1 - silenced B cells compared to controls cells . However , no 449 significant differences between control and ATAT1 - silenced cells were observed when 450 activated on soft substrates . This result is consistent with our observations showing that B cells 451 activated on soft substrates display low levels of translocation of ATAT1 to the cytoplasm and 452 therefore silencing of this enzyme should not have a major effect on antigen presentation . 453 Additionally , the capacity of ATAT1 - silenced B cells to present processed LACK 156 - 173 454 peptide was slightly decreased compared to control cells ( Fig . 5 D ) , suggesting that B - T cell 455 interactions could be affected . Collectively , these results suggest that silencing ATAT1 renders 456 B cells insensitive to substrate rigidity during activation , compromising their capacity to 457 enhance antigen extraction and presentation . 458 In summary ( Fig . 5 E ) , our results highlight how B cells couple mechanosensing pathways to 459 control lysosome dynamics and tune their capacity to extract and present immobilized antigens . 460 We show that B cells respond to substrate stiffness translocating ATAT1 from the nucleus to 461 the cytoplasm , thereby increasing tubulin acetylation , which in turn promotes stable lysosome 462 recruitment at the IS . Notably , upon interaction of B cells with stiffer substrates , their 463 lysosomes exhibit a more concentrated pool at the center of the immunological synapse , 464 displaying slower speed and less displacement compared to lysosomes from B cells activated 465 on softer substrates . These changes in lysosome dynamics correlate with the levels of tubulin 466 acetylation , upregulated by B cells in response to substrate stiffness , where lysosomes 467 preferentially associate to acetylated tubulin tracks in stiffer conditions . Overall , these findings 468 underscore the existence of a cellular pathway that connects antigen - extraction mechanisms 469 with mechanical cues originating from APCs , which are regulated by BCR - mediated 470 mechanosensing . 471 References 472 Akkaya , M . , Kwak , K . and Pierce , S .

This enables the central accumulation of lysosomes that preferentially bind to 642 acetylated microtubules at the immune synapse of B cells . These lysosomes exhibit slower 643 speed and displacement than lysosomes from B cells activated on soft substrates . 644 Consequently , B cells interacting with antigens coupled to stiff substrates increase their 645 capacity to capture and present antigens to T cells which is impaired upon ATAT1 646 downregulation .
