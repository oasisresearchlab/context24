Highlights  In one day , 4 % ( 6 in 150 ) of hospital visitors had asymptomatic COVID - 19  Potential of visitors’ viral shedding in healthcare facilities is underestimated J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 2  SARS - CoV - 2 introduction into facilities is not fully blocked by universal masking Abstract - Word count : 48 In one day , 6 in 150 ( 4 % ) asymptomatic visitors were diagnosed with COVID - 19 at a hospital with universal masking policy . Two inpatients ( contacts ) subsequentely developed symptoms . More rigorous protective measures during visitation periods may need to be included in infection control practices in order to reduce nosocomial transmissions .

J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 Full text – word count : 799 Introduction The burden of asymptomatic Coronavirus Disease - 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) on clinical practice and epidemiological control remains a challenge , especially due to high potential of transmission ( 1 , 2 ) . While several nosocomial outbreaks have been reported ( 2 , 3 ) , most studies focused on the role of asymptomatic hospitalized patients ( 4 , 5 ) . However , hospital visitors’ impact on viral shedding in healthcare facilities remains underestimated . Methods On August 29th , 2020 , visitors of hospitalized patients at São Paulo Hospital in São Paulo , Brazil , were enrolled for COVID - 19 screening with reverse transcription – polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) on nasopharyngeal specimens . All subjects were assessed for COVID - 19 symptoms ( including fever [ ≥37 . 8 °C ] , cough , anosmia , dysgeusia , dyspnea , myalgia , headache , and nasal discharge ) , and were asymptomatic at enrollment . This hospital receives around 150 visitors daily , and COVID - 19 restrictions had been implemented : only one visitor per patient was allowed . According to universal masking policies , all visitors and patients had to wear face masks ( cloth or surgical ) , as did the healthcare staff ( surgical ) . Since no visitor was symptomatic of COVID - 19 and had no J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 known exposure to confirmed cases , visitations were allowed normally and outcomes were then monitored via telephone until test results . If positive , they were assessed for symptoms and alert signs , and oriented accordingly . Relevant clinical information was collected at the time of enrollment . This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee from the Federal University of São Paulo and all individuals signed written informed consent forms . Samples’ RNA were purified with Quick - RNA Viral Kit ( Zymo Research , Irvine , CA , USA ) , and viral detection was performed with AgPath - ID One - Step RT - PCR reagents ( ThermoFisher Scientific , Austin , TX , USA ) , according to manufacturers’ instructions . A 20 µL total reaction volume containing 5 . 0 µL purified RNA , 400 nM primers , and 200 nM probes following the CDC USA protocol targeting the N1 and N2 sequences of the SARS - CoV - 2 nucleoprotein gene ( 8 ) , with a sensitivity of 75 - 80 % ( 9 ) . Cycle thresholds < 40 were considered positive . Data were summarized as percentages and medians ( ranges ) ; 95 % confidence intervals were calculated via the binomial method using Free Statistics Software ( version 4 . 0 ) . Results One hundred and fifty asymptomatic visitors were screened for COVID - 19 . Median age was 39 years ( range , 15 - 75 ) and 109 of them ( 72 , 6 % ) were women . Five individuals ( 3 , 33 % ) had previously been diagnosed with COVID - 19 . Six asymptomatic visitors ( 4 % , 95 % CI , 1 , 48 % - 8 , 50 % ) had a positive RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 ( table 1 ) . Four of them ( 66 , 7 % ) were asymptomatic until assessment fourteen days after testing . One patient ( 16 , 6 % ) developed mild symptoms in the J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 following day , and the other ( 16 , 6 % ) had been diagnosed with COVID - 19 by RT - PCR twenty days prior , but remained positive despite no residual symptoms . Two visited patients ( 33 , 3 % ) developed symptoms in the following day , and had COVID - 19 confirmed by RT - PCR , but were discharged without complications . The other four patients / contacts ( 66 , 6 % ) were not infected on this occasion . Discussion While most studies have focused on the role of both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID - 19 for nosocomial infections ( 4 , 5 ) , our study shows a possible contribution of visitors on viral shedding in healthcare facilities . Contacts of visitors 3 and 5 ( table 1 ) were also diagnosed with COVID - 19 so this was considered a possible source of exposure , despite use of face covering . The repetitive contact during visitations on multiple occasions possibly accounted for higher risk in these cases ( figure 1 ) . Moreover , visitor 3 was the patient’s spouse and had been diagnosed twenty days prior , without residual symptoms at the time of enrollment in this study . There was close contact between them before and during hospitalization . One possibility is that transmission happened beforehand , since longer incubation periods and transmission from asymptomatic individuals have been reported ( 1 ) . Although it is not possible to completely exclude transmissions related to other patients or hospital staff ( 1 - 4 ) , no other contacts developed symptoms before or afterwards . Healthcare - related outbreaks of COVID - 19 have been reported ( 2 , 3 ) mostly when institutions had not implemented adequate infection control measures ( 5 ) . A recent large US study showed a low incidence of hospital - acquired COVID - 19 ( 5 ) . However , J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 nosocomial infections still occur , and may be closely related to asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals’ potential of transmission ( 4 ) . While implementation of universal masking does reduce transmissions ( 4 - 6 ) , they might also induce a false perception of protection that could lead to neglect of other important protective measures ( 6 ) . The risk of SARS - CoV - 2 introduction into facilities by visitors increases as community transmission is widespread ( 7 ) , therefore occurrence of outbreaks could be mitigated with restriction of time and physical contact during visitation periods , and reassurance of adequate and frequent hand hygiene , as well as personal protective equipment , when necessary . Besides , active screening for visitors might need to be considered as part of infection control protocols ( 7 ) . In summary , surveillance of asymptomatic visitors with a rigorous implementation of protective measures during visitation periods may need to be included in infection control practices in order to reduce transmissions in healthcare settings .
