Actomyosin - driven left - right asymmetry : from molecular torques to chiral self organization Sundar Ram Naganathan 1 , 6 , Teije C Middelkoop 2 , 6 , Sebastian Fu¨rthauer 3 , 4 , 6 and Stephan W Grill 2 , 5 Chirality or mirror asymmetry is a common theme in biology found in organismal body plans , tissue patterns and even in individual cells . In many cases the emergence of chirality is driven by actin cytoskeletal dynamics . Although it is well established that the actin cytoskeleton generates rotational forces at the molecular level , we are only beginning to understand how this can result in chiral behavior of the entire actin network in vivo . In this review , we will give an overview of actin driven chiralities across different length scales known until today .

All rights reserved . Introduction An object is said to be chiral , mirror asymmetric or handed , if its mirror image is non - superimposable on itself . Most animal body plans are chiral with left - right ( LR ) asymmetric internal organ arrangements that are consistent between individuals [ 1 ] . Moreover , chirality of biological systems can emerge across multiple length scales . Directional looping of the heart [ 2 ] and intestine [ 3 ] are common examples of tissue chirality . At the cellular level , LR asymmetric polarization behavior has been observed in various cultured cells [ 4 , 5 ] . Finally , all biological macromolecules and many interactions be - tween them , for example receptor – ligand binding , dis - play chiral features [ 6 ] . Chirality of an organism must derive from the chirality of constituents . Hence Brown and Wolpert hypothesized that embryonic LR symmetry breaking is facilitated by aligning putative chiral molecules ( termed F - molecules ) with respect to the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes [ 7 ] . In such a way , micro - scale chirality is transformed to chirality at cell - and tissue ( macro ) scales . For example , during gastrulation in many vertebrate species , a cilia - driven leftward extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow in the ventral node ultimately triggers LR asymmetric gene expression in the entire body [ 8 – 10 ] . In this case the F - molecule takes the form of a cilium , which beats in a chiral fashion [ 11 ] . However , for many other instances of LR symmetry breaking it is not as clear how chirality at the molecular scale determines chirality at the cell and tissue scale . Although the generic F - molecule has not been identiﬁed yet , common to many chiral symmetry breaking events is a requirement of the cytoskeleton [ 12 ] . This raises the question whether cytoskeletal dynamics could fulﬁll the role of Brown and Wolpert’s F - molecule . In this review , we will focus on chiral morphogenesis of cells , tissues and organisms that are driven by the acto - myosin cytoskeleton . At the molecular level , processes in the actin cytoskeleton can generate rotational forces [ 13 – 17 ] . Several recent biophysical studies have linked these molecular torques to chiral organization of the entire actin network [ 18 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 19 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . We now argue that proper alignment of molecular torques generated by the actin cytoskeleton can facilitate chiral symmetry breaking of cells , tissues and organisms . Actomyosin drives cellular and multicellular chiral processes Early organismal LR symmetry breaking In several model organisms , LR symmetries are broken already during early embryogenesis when embryos con - sist of just a few cells . Here , we discuss examples where the actin cytoskeleton drives these early symmetry break - ing events . In the small nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , it was recently discovered that the actomyosin cortex plays a crucial role in LR symmetry breaking [ 19 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . During the 4 – 6 cell stage transition , two blastomeres , whose spindles are set along the LR axis ( see Figure 1a ) , rotate in a Available online at www . sciencedirect . com ScienceDirect Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2016 , 38 : 24 – 30 www . sciencedirect . com Actomyosin - driven left - right asymmetry Naganathan et al . 25 Figure 1 P2 ABar ABal ABpr ABpl C . elegans , 4 - 6 cell stage transition L . stagnalis , 4 - 8 cell stage transition Wild type Wild type , clockwise displacement of micromeres Latrunculin treatment - Actin polymerization inhibition , reduced chiral rearrangement A R L P ( Dorsal view ) ( Animal view ) Early organismal LR asymmetry rga - 3 ( RNAi ) - Increased actomyosin chiral flow , increased spindle rotation ect - 2 ( RNAi ) - Decreased actomyosin chiral flow , decreased spindle rotation Fibroblast cells plated on circular fibronectin ( FN ) islands Cellular chirality rga - 3 ( RNAi ) - Increased actomyosin dynamics , increased counter - rotation ect - 2 ( RNAi ) - Decreased actomyosin dynamics , decreased counter - rotation A P C . elegans zygote Low actinin amounts , CCW swirl High actinin amounts , CW swirl ( View of cortex from outside the embryo ) myo1D - / - Myosin mutation , reversed chirality Wild type , chiral arrangement D . melanogaster Vascular mesenchymal cells Wild type R L ( Dorsal view ) Tissue chirality FN FN - Fibronectin PEG PEG - Polyethylene glycol PEG Blebbistatin treatment - Myosin inhibition , random arrangement ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) Current Opinion in Cell Biology Illustration of left - right ( LR ) asymmetries across different length scales . ( a ) Early organismal LR asymmetry : C . elegans — Two cells at the 4 - cell stage , while dividing into ABar - ABal and ABpr - ABpl , exhibit a clockwise spindle rotation ( when viewed dorsally ) . This is driven by counter - rotating cortical flows ( beige arrows ) , the magnitude of which is controlled by the Rho signaling pathway , with ect - 2 / rga - 3 ( RNAi ) leading to Rho inactivation / activation respectively .

This gives rise to a chiral 6 - cell conﬁguration that marks the initiation of LR asymmetry in the embryo . The actomy - osin cortex in these rotating blastomeres exhibits chiral counter - rotating cortical ﬂows along the division axes ( beige arrows in Figure 1a ) . Importantly , changing the counter - rotation ﬂow speed changes the degree of blas - tomere rotation ( dashed lines in Figure 1a ) [ 19 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] , indi - cating that chiral ﬂows execute LR symmetry breaking in this system . A particularly interesting chiral pattern of early develop - ment is found in spiralians , a clade that includes snails and annelid worms [ 22 , 23 ] . At the 4 – 8 cell stage transition in snails , all blastomeres rotate their axis of division such that their daughter cells are displaced in either a clock - wise ( CW ) or counter - clockwise ( CCW ) fashion ( Figure 1a ) . Eventually , this determines handedness of the body plan [ 24 , 25 ] . Mild chemical inhibition of actin assembly abolished these chiral rearrangements , demon - strating that actomyosin plays an important role ( Figure 1a ) [ 24 ] . However , it is unknown whether chiral actomyosin ﬂows , similar to the ones in C . elegans embryos , facilitate symmetry breaking in spiralians . Finally , in the vertebrate Xenopus laevis , the actin cyto - skeleton is involved in chiral symmetry breaking during the ﬁrst cell division [ 26 - 28 ] . It was observed that the frog cortex displays a subtle counter - rotating motion that when enhanced by drug treatment , affects LR asymmetry of the adult body plan [ 29 ] . Altogether , actin - driven chiral cell movements during early embryogenesis guide organ - ismal LR patterning in various animals . Tissue chirality Individual tissues also exhibit chiral asymmetries that are dependent on the actomyosin cytoskeleton . Noe¨l et al . revealed that chiral looping of the zebraﬁsh heart was maintained ex vivo in cultured heart explants and attenu - ation of actomyosin activity abolished this chiral behavior [ 30 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Moreover , several tissues in Drosophila ( gut , sper - miduct , testes , male terminalia ) exhibit LR asymmetries and chiral morphogenesis , which upon mutation of myosin 1D ( myo1D ) exhibit reversed lateralizations [ 31 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 32 – 35 ] ( Figure 1b ) . Whether actin or actomyosin dynamics play a direct role in these processes remains to be established . Therefore , the myo1D mutant is vital for a further under - standing of the mechanisms by which tissue asymmetries emerge . Interestingly , it was suggested that tissue - scale chirality can emerge from chiral shape and chiral polarity of individual cells [ 36 – 38 , 39 (cid:2) ] . Chiral behaviors are also observed in tissue culture cells at conﬂuent stages [ 4 , 40 (cid:2) , 41 ] . Wan et al . showed that nu - merous cell types , when cultured on circular micropat - terns , aligned in either a CW or CCW fashion . Notably , when exposed to actin - interfering drugs ( latrunculin A , cytochalsin D , jasplakinolide but not blebbistatin ) , cell lines that displayed CCW alignment tended to reverse their chirality [ 42 ] . Another study [ 4 ] showed that vascular smooth muscle cells grown to conﬂuency on micropat - terned stripes aligned in a consistent chiral manner that could be abolished by drug treatments targeting non - muscle myosin II or Rho signaling ( Figure 1b ) . Taken together , these ﬁndings suggest that tissue - scale chirality likely emerges from actomyosin activity in individual cells interacting with physical boundaries imposed by either the surrounding tissues in vivo or the micropat - terned surface in vitro . Cell chirality Individual cells are known to exhibit chiral asymmetries , which also depend on intracellular actomyosin activity [ 5 , 18 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 43 , 44 ] . A recent study spear - headed by the Ber - shadsky group showed that ﬁbroblasts on micropatterned round surfaces display striking chiral rearrangements [ 18 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . When the ﬁbroblasts settled on the micropattern , cells displayed a dynamic chiral self - assembly of the actin cytoskeleton with a CCW swirl . The handedness of the pattern is determined by the actin ﬁlament crosslinking protein , a - actinin ( Figure 1c ) . The authors suggest that this chiral behavior is driven by rotational movements generated through formin - mediated actin polymerization at peripheral focal adhesions . Finally , individual cell chirality was also observed in the C . elegans zygote [ 19 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 45 (cid:2) ] . During anteroposterior polar - ization , counter - rotating actomyosin ﬂows were observed . Similar to the counter - rotating ﬂows at the 4 – 6 cell stage , increasing actomyosin activity could enhance chiral ﬂows ( grey arrows in Figure 1c ) . Taken together , these ﬁndings clearly suggest that intracellular actomyosin dynamics are driving chiral asymmetries at organismal , tissue and cel - lular scales . Chiral self - organization of the actin cytoskeleton We next discuss the mechanisms by which chirality emerges in the actomyosin cytoskeleton . For this , con - sider the simplest way of generating a chiral object from an achiral one : apply a torque to twist it . In a develop - mental context the torque for this must be self - generated . This raises two questions : are there microscopic processes 26 Cell architecture ( Figure 1 Legend Continued ) ( clockwise , CW or counter - clockwise , CCW ) in fibroblasts plated on circular micropatterns . Actin fibers are shown in orange and focal adhesions in yellow . C . elegans zygote — The actomyosin cortex exhibits clockwise rotations ( beige arrows ) . A gradient in myosin activity leads to counter - rotating cortical flows ( black arrows ) breaking chiral symmetries . Size / width of the arrows represent magnitude of torques / flow velocities . Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2016 , 38 : 24 – 30 www . sciencedirect . com in the actin cytoskeleton that generate torques ? If so , how could these drive cell chirality ? Molecular - scale torque generation in the actin cytoskeleton Actin ﬁlaments are polar right - handed helices with a barbed ( + ) and a pointed ( (cid:3) ) end and a helical pitch of around 72 nm [ 46 ] . Their inherent chirality can facilitate the transduction of molecular - scale torque generation during their polymerization , when they interact with motor molecules and while they depolymerize . In vitro experiments showed that , when immobilized on a glass surface , formins rotate actin ﬁlaments upon polymeriza - tion with a full turn per helical pitch [ 13 ] ( Figure 2a , left ) . Molecular torques also arise as a result of chiral interac - tions between myosin motor proteins and actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 2a , right ) [ 14 – 17 , 47 – 50 ] . Moreover , myosin gen - erates tension in the network , which can lead to torque generation through non - trivial tension - torque coupling [ 51 , 52 ] . Finally , the actin depolymerizing protein , coﬁlin , when bound to actin ﬁlaments locally modiﬁes the pitch of the actin helix [ 53 , 54 ] , possibly generating torques in the process . From molecular - scale torque generation to large - scale twist To unravel how molecular processes can drive chiral self - assembly of the actin cytoskeleton , Tee et al . ( see section ‘Cell chirality’ and Figure 1c , left ) focused on the molec - ular scale and characterized both the overall structure and the molecular constituents of the actin cytoskeleton dur - ing its assembly [ 18 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 55 ] . Their analysis showed that contractile forces within transverse ﬁbers together with formin - mediated actin polymerization of radial ﬁbers are key to the dynamic behavior . Since formins generate torques upon actin polymerization [ 13 ] , they proposed that actin polymerization at the focal adhesions will rotate radial actin ﬁbers . Simulation using a computational model that implemented the actin network topology together with these forces could faithfully describe the observed chiral self - organization . In this model molecular torques are generated by formins at focal adhesions . Because in these circular ﬁbroblasts focal adhesions are enriched at the cell periphery , molecular torques are thus distributed asymmetrically along the mediolateral axis of the cell ( Figure 1c , left ) . Hence , asymmetric molecular torque generation can result in chiral symmetry breaking . In many cases where molecular details are not available , a complementary approach is needed to describe large - scale dynamics . Ignoring molecular details , the cortex can be thought of as a thin layer of an active polar gel underneath the cell membrane that has liquid - like prop - erties 56 – 59 . The gel is characterized by a number of large - scale material parameters , which encompass all the details of the underlying molecular processes . Such an approach has been successful for describing large scale rearrangements in the cortical layer [ 60 ] or investigating the force balance in the layer [ 61 ] . However , in these earlier works there was no chiral component to this thin layer of active liquid material . To investigate how molec - ular torque generation in this active and liquid - like layer results in chiral ﬂows , Fu¨rthauer et al . considered the effects of molecular - scale torque generation in an active gel [ 62 , 63 (cid:2) ] . Even without detailed knowledge of the microscopic mechanisms , this allows to ask the following question : what are the large - scale effects that emerge from the presence of micro - scale torque generators in the material ? It turns out that the constraints imposed by physical conservation laws lead to relatively simple ge - neric equations of motion in which all uncertainties about microscopic interactions are summarized by just a handful of physical parameters that can be measured . For in - stance , thinking of the C . elegans cell cortex as a thin ﬁlm of an active chiral gel [ 19 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] summarizes the whole complexity of the actin cortex by just its effective viscos - ity , its tendency to spontaneously contract under the inﬂuence of motor proteins , and its chirality , that is its Actomyosin - driven left - right asymmetry Naganathan et al . 27 Figure 2 ( a ) ( b ) – + Formin Myosin F - actin Current Opinion in Cell Biology Torque generation by the actin cytoskeleton . ( a ) Actin polymerization at the barbed end by formin dimers results in rotation of the elongating filament along its axis . While pulling on actin , myosins ( green ) generate torque dipoles , for example when a myosin filament pulls on two oppositely oriented actin filaments . ( b ) A torque dipole ( actin filament ) in contact with two unequal surfaces can rotate . In the case of the actomyosin cortex , the two unequal surfaces can be thought of as the cytoplasm and the membrane . www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2016 , 38 : 24 – 30 ability to generate torques . Despite its simplicity , this theory quantitatively describes cortical ﬂows using pa - rameters inferred from experiment [ 19 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . The phenomenological theory [ 62 , 63 (cid:2) ] allows to identify generic conditions under which microscopic torque gen - erators can produce large - scale twist deformations . The problem boils down to one of symmetry : how to arrange cytoskeletal torque generators such that large - scale chiral ﬂows arise ? With regards to the actomyosin cortex , actin ﬁlaments are known to be randomly oriented in the cortical layer [ 64 ] . However , the inside and outside of the cell are different ( cytosol vs . membrane ) and the distribution of cortical proteins along the thickness direc - tion is anisotropic . Therefore , the physical boundary conditions between the cortical layer and the inside and the outside of the cell are different . Because of this intrinsic asymmetry along the membrane - cortex - cytosol axis , molecular torque generation can impart angular momentum onto the cortex ( Figure 2b ) [ 63 (cid:2) ] , in a way reminiscent of a skater who pushes against the ice below to make herself spin . This is the ﬁrst condition for torque generators to cause large scale rotatory motion : a local broken symmetry must exist such that microscopic torque generators can be aligned . However , if active torques from aligned torque generators are imparted all over the cortical layer homogeneously , no twist deformation could result since all torques cancel globally . This is reminiscent of contractile ﬂow in the cortex , which arises only when some part of the cortex contracts more than the rest , but not when the whole cortex contracts equally [ 61 ] . Hence another broken symmetry must exist that speciﬁes the direction around which to twist . In C . elegans zygotes , twist deformation is generated by coupling torque generation to the AP axis . Here , a gradient of myosin motor proteins along the AP axis — presumably triggered by the sperm - derived centrosome — leads to a gradient in active torques , which ultimately leads to the observed twist rotation ( see Figure 1 ) . To summarize this section , for molecular - scale torque generators to produce cellular - scale twist deformations two conditions must be met : torque generators must have access to a local asymmetry , for instance the presence of a surface , to allow for local injection of angular momentum into the system , and secondly torque generators must have access to another asymmetry that speciﬁes the global axis of twist . Importantly , this organizing principle needs to hold regardless of the mechanism that generates the torques microscopically . Hence , we expect the same principle to also apply for larger - scale phenomena such as twisting cells organizing into chiral tissues . Conclusion When Brown and Wolpert formulated their F - molecule hypothesis they assumed that LR asymmetry emerges due to the alignment of certain chiral molecules along the major body axes [ 7 , 11 ] . We would here like to put forward a slightly modiﬁed version and state that an ‘F - activity’ that is active torques generated by the cytoskeleton , drives those instances of chiral symmetry breaking where actomyosin plays a key role . Given that chiral morpho - genesis in many different contexts depends on a func - tional actin cytoskeleton , the alignment of an F - activity may be a unifying principle guiding diverse LR pattern - ing events . Clearly , the next step is to bridge the gap between molecular torques and large - scale chiral rearran - gements , and this requires the development of physical theories that take into account force and torque balances . Finally , the actomyosin cortex is a prominent example of a new class of active chiral materials . Thus , better under - standing its physics will be an inspiration not only to biologists but also hopefully to material scientists and engineers . Intriguingly , even though chirality is an inherent property of cytoskeletal networks , chiral rearrangements appear to mostly occur at speciﬁc time points during embryonic development . This means that chiral properties are likely regulated by developmentally signiﬁcant pathways ( such as Wnt signaling as shown in [ 19 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] ) , which are yet to be characterized with respect to chiral morphogenesis . With respect to chiral deformations in tissues [ 36 – 38 , 39 (cid:2) ] , an open question is whether the epithelium behaves as a single mechanical entity where active torque generation throughout the actomyosin cortex of the entire epitheli - um is the cause of all global chiral deformations . The combination of modern day developmental biology and quantitative physical modeling promises exciting new advancements in our understanding of organismal LR asymmetry and chiral patterning of cells and tissues . Not only will this multidisciplinary approach identify novel components and regulatory principles , it will also yield quantitative mechanistic insights into a phenome - non that has puzzled developmental biologists for dec - ades .
