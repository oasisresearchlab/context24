Competing interests : none declared . ABSTRACT The nervous system detects and inter - prets a variety of chemical , mechanical , and thermal stimuli . In the face of tis - sue injury , local inflammatory products perpetuate ongoing activity and sensiti - sation of the peripheral nerve termini . This ongoing activity evokes a state of robust spinal facilitation mediated by a number of local circuits , the net effect yielding an enhanced message of nocic - eption to higher centres . This messaging typically wanes with the resolution of inflammation or wound healing . How - ever , there are situations in which pe - ripheral and central components of the pain transmission pathway extend and enhance the pain state , leading to a per - sistent hypersensitivity , e . g . , an acute to chronic pain transition . Current work points to the contribution of innate and adaptive immunity in creating these en - during conditions . We briefly describe the underlying biological components of both physiological pain processing and pathological pain processing , as well as the acute to chronic pain transition and the role of innate and adaptive immunity in this transition . Introduction Detection of noxious stimuli is essential for survival . Acute , high intensity stim - uli are alerting , and warn the organism of impending tissue damage . This acute pain sensation often subsides with the resolution of inflammation . However , there are instances in which pain may extended beyond the period of initial inflammation and tissue repair ( 1 - 5 ) . In - deed , individuals with chronic inflam - matory conditions can experience in - tense pain that persists even with remis - sion of the inflammatory signs ( 6 ) . In these cases , the pain state is pathologic , maladaptive , and debilitating . This un - coupling of pain from other signs of in - jury and inflammation represents a tran - sition from an “acute to a chronic pain state” . In this review , we will briefly outline mechanisms of acute and per - sistent or chronic pain . In addition , we will consider current thinking regarding the transition from an acute to a chronic pain state , which is thought to involve innate and adaptive immune signalling . A schematic summary of the mecha - nisms to be discussed are presented in Figure 1 . The abbreviations used in the text are presented in the figure legend . Physiological pain processing initiated by acute stimulation Under normal conditions , activity in all classes of sensory afferents is largely absent . However , application of a nox - ious ( potentially tissue injuring ) stimu - lus ( e . g . thermal , mechanical , chemical ) will activate ion channels on the periph - eral terminal causing depolarisation of the small , first order primary afferent neurons expressing these channels . The action potentials , with a frequency proportional to stimulus intensity , are propagated along the axons of nocicep - tive Aδ and C fibres , through the dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) to the axon ter - minals in the spinal cord dorsal horn . In response to an intense stimulus , the medium diameter , rapidly conducting Aδ fibres relay well - localised “first” or fast pain , while the small diameter , un - myelinated , slow conducting C fi - bres convey poorly localised “second” or slow pain . High threshold afferents project into the superficial dorsal horn ( referred to as Rexed Laminae I and II ) , while large , low threshold , mechanical - ly sensitive afferents ( Aβ ) project into the dorsal horn to terminate in deeper lamina ( Lamina III - V ) ( 7 ) . The second order dorsal horn neurons involved in pain circuitry exist in two broadly characterised populations . Lamina I ( marginal ) neurons lie in the superficial spinal cord , primarily receive high threshold input , and are “nociceptive specific” . Other popula - tions of second order neurons lie more deeply ( Lamina V ) and send their den - drites dorsally to receive input from low threshold ( A fibres ) and then high An overview of pathways encoding nociception S .

Tissue injury , inflammation , or infection lead to local release of pro - inflammatory mediators ( inflammatory soup ) from resident cells ( mast cells , Schwann cells ) , in migrating cells ( macrophages , neutrophils ) , damaged cells , and blood vessels . These products act on receptors expressed on the afferent C fibre terminal to mediate an ongoing terminal depolarisation and increased intracellular Ca + + , which , in turn , activates terminal kinases . Phosphorylation of terminal receptors and channels enhances their responsiveness and results in “terminal sensitisation” . B . Nociceptive afferents synapse onto superficial ( Lamina 1 ) and deep ( Lamina V ) neurons , and , though activation of afferent terminal CaVs , release glu - tamate and peptides ( substance P ) which act on eponymous post - synaptic receptors . In the face of ongoing C fibre input , the second order neuron displays marked increases in excitability resulting from increased intracellular Ca + + that activates a myriad of protein kinases which i ) phosphorylate receptors and channels , and ii ) activate a variety of excitatory enzyme systems and iii ) enhancing gene transcription . Other facilitatory components of dorsal horn func - tion activated by ongoing C fibre input are : i ) activation of glia ( microglia and astrocytes ) which release a constellation of pro - inflammatory molecules , ii ) reduced effects of local GABA and glycinergic inhibition and iii ) bulbospinal facilitatory input . C . These events initiate and maintain a hyperexcitable state , sending the processed nociceptive signals to higher brain centres though the contralateral spinothalamic tract to the thalamus , and collateral projections into brainstem nuclei . Supraspinal projections largely follow two major trajectories : those projecting into the lateral ( somatosensory ) thalamus and thence to the somatosensory cortex and those projecting to more medial regions that then project to areas such as the inferior insula and the anterior cingulate .

Woller et al . threshold ( A∂ / C fibre ) input , either mono - or poly - synaptically on their dis - tal ( superficial ) dendrites . This popula - tion , referred to as convergent or wide dynamic range ( WDR ) neurons , shows a graded response over a wide range of A and C fibre mediated inputs . Second order neurons , activated by the acute release of glutamate , acting though glu - tamate ionophores , such as the AMPA receptor , project to supraspinal sites through crossed ventrolateral tracts . Within the brain , there is not one region responsible for processing all sensory inputs . Rather , projections from the ven - trolateral quadrants of the spinal cord ascend following two principal trajec - tories : i ) to the somatosensory thalamus and thence to the somatosensory cortex , and ii ) to the medial and ventromedial thalamus , to the limbic forebrain ( e . g . , anterior cingulate and the inferior in - sula ) ( 8 ) . The first trajectory appears to encode both location and intensity of the stimulus , while the second provides information to systems associated with emotionality and affect . Hence , acute pain processing is mediated by signals from the periphery through the dorsal horn , relayed through the thalamus to specific central regions for processing , giving rise to the somatosensory and cognitive aspects of pain . For a detailed review , see ( 9 , 10 ) . Typically , these sig - nals cease when the peripheral inciting stimulus subsides . Persistent pain processing secondary to local injury and inflammation While acute pain is adaptive , local in - flammation and injury frequently result in a pain state initiated by otherwise in - nocuous or moderately aversive stimuli ( allodynia and hyperalgesia , respec - tively ) . This change in the input - output function reflects two related events : pe - ripheral and central sensitisation . Peripheral sensitisation In the periphery , tissue injury results in a peripheral sensitisation that induces a hyperexcitability of afferent noci - ceptive neurons ( 11 - 14 ) . In the face of tissue injury , there is cell damage , plasma extravasation , activation of lo - cal primary afferent terminals , and the movement of inflammatory cells into the injury site all leading to the release of a myriad of active products includ - ing amines , lipids , cytokines , and pep - tide transmitters ( 15 - 33 ) . Importantly , the sensory afferent terminal expresses receptors for virtually all of these prod - ucts . Activation of the terminal recep - tors leads to depolarisation and in - creased intracellular calcium . The net effect is terminal depolarisation and the activation of a variety of protein ( e . g . , protein kinase C ) and mitogen activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) . These kinases phosphorylate trans - ducer proteins ( e . g . , TRPV1 ) and ion channels , such as the voltage sensitive sodium channels , leading to their en - hanced activation ( 34 - 36 ) . Not all peripheral afferents share the same threshold for transmitting signals . Many C - fibres have little or no sponta - neous activity and are activated only by intense physical stimuli and are referred to as “silent nociceptors” . In the pres - ence of injury products , these terminals are sensitised such that they become spontaneously active and their activity can be elicited by moderate physical stimuli , analogous to an allodynic state . This functional motif is common to vir - tually all innervated tissues , ( consider diagnoses that end in “ - itis” ) . Central sensitisation In the dorsal horn , WDR ( Lamina V ) neurons display a stimulus dependent response to the discrete activation of afferent C - fibres . Repetitive stimula - tion of C , but not A , fibres at a moder - ately fast rate results in a progressively facilitated discharge . The exaggerated discharge of WDR neurons evoked by repetitive small afferent stimulation was dubbed “wind up” by Mendell and Wall ( 37 , 38 ) . Intracellular recording in the WDR neuron has indicated that the facilitated state is represented by a progressive and long sustained partial depolarisation of the cell , rendering the membrane increasingly susceptible to subsequent afferent input . This cen - tral facilitation represents a complex cascade , including : i ) phosphorylation of NMDA ( N - methyl - D - aspartate ) re - ceptor and removal of the magnesium block , which otherwise prevents the functioning of the NMDA ionophore ( 39 - 44 ) ; ii ) activation of metabotrophic receptors for glutamate and substance P ( sP , the NK1 receptor ) , leading to in - creased intracellular calcium ( 45 - 55 ) ; iii ) activation of voltage gated calcium channels ( Cav 2 . 2 , 3 . 1 , 3 . 2 , 3 . 3 chan - nels ) ( 56 , 57 ) ; iv ) activation of a variety of kinases leading to the phosphoryla - tion of membrane channels and recep - tors enhancing their excitability ( 33 , 58 - 63 ) ; v ) activation of non - neuronal cells ( astrocytes , microglia , T cells ) ( 64 - 69 ) leading to the release of a vari - ety of pro - excitatory lipids ( prostaglan - dins ) ( 70 , 71 ) , cytokines ( Interleukin ( IL ) , IL - 8 , IL - 1β , IL - 6 , tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) ) ( 23 , 72 – 75 ) , chemokines ( 76 - 80 ) , matrix metalloproteinases ( 81 - 86 ) , and endogenous damage / danger associated membrane signals ( DAMPS ) ( 87 - 90 ) ; vi ) afferent acti - vation of spinobulbospinal excitatory feedback onto dorsal horn nociceptive neurons ( 8 , 91 - 94 ) ; and vii ) reduced ac - tivation and efficacy of intrinsic GABA and glycinergic inhibitory regulation of large ( Aβ ) excitatory input and second order WDR neuron excitability ( e . g . , by disinhibition ) leading to an enhanced response to large afferent input ( 95 ) . Together , these cascades contribute to the ongoing hyperalgesic and allodynic states initiated by tissue injury and in - flammation . Blockade or inhibition of components of the cascade can reduce the hyperpathic phenotype in models of peripheral inflammation and tissue injury . Usually , these states initiated by inflammation and tissue injury abate with resolution of the inflammatory state and wound healing . Acute to chronic pain transition As discussed previously , the pain state associated with and originating from prolonged inflammation may persist even when the inflammatory state re - solves . This has been demonstrated in a variety of clinical conditions associated with tissue trauma ( post - surgical ) and chronic inflammation ( rheumatic dis - ease such as rheumatoid arthritis ) . This phenomenon has been experimentally demonstrated in antibody generated murine models of joint inflammation , such as the K / BxN ( 96 - 98 ) and colla - gen antibody induced arthritis ( CAIA ) S - 43 Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 2017 Pathways encoding nociception / S . A . Woller et al . models ( 99 , 100 ) . In these models , mice develop long lasting , but reversible clinical signs which peak by several days following initiation . At the onset of paw swelling , mice show a decrease in paw withdrawal threshold , indicating development of tactile allodynia . Unex - pectedly , this tactile allodynia persists long after resolution of visible swelling and inflammation . Several observations suggest that the pain - like behaviour oc - curring during active inflammation ( in - flammatory phase tactile allodynia ) is phenotypically distinct from pain - like behaviours persisting after the reso - lution of inflammation ( post - inflam - matory phase tactile allodynia ) . First , tactile allodynia in the inflammatory phase is transiently reversed by anti - in - flammatory agents ( e . g . , non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ) and centrally active anti - hyperalgesic agents ( e . g . , gabapentin ) used for the treatment of neuropathic pain , while the post - inflammatory phase tactile allodynia is only affected by the centrally active anti - hyperalgesics ( 96 ) . Second , mice in the post - inflammatory phase show increased activating transcription factor 3 ( ATF3 ) positive neurons in the DRG , a marker associated with nerve injury and neuropathic pain ( 96 ) . Finally , in chronic inflammatory models , there is a sprouting of peptidergic and non - peptidergic primary afferents as well as post - ganglionic sympathetic ( tyrosine hydroxylase positive ) fibres into the inflamed joint and the appearance of growth associated protein ( GAP 43 ) , a marker of axonal neurite formation and regeneration ( 101 – 104 ) . Together , these observations indicate that there is a transition from an acute inflamma - tion to a post - inflammatory neuropathic pain phenotype in these models of ar - thritis , leading to a persistent pain con - dition . Additional studies have impli - cated both the innate and adaptive im - mune systems as playing distinct roles in governing this transition to chronic pain state . Innate immunity There is a growing appreciation that components of the evolving pain may reflect a role for innate and adaptive im - munity ( 64 , 87 , 105 - 108 ) . The role of microglia ( brain resident macrophages ) and astrocytes in pain pathophysiology is well appreciated . Recent work has shown that several Toll - like receptors ( TLRs ) , such as TLR4 , are robustly expressed on glia and primary affer - ent neurons ( 109 - 111 ) . These receptors are activated by a variety of exogenous pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) and endogenous ligands com - monly referred to as damage associated molecular patterns ( DAMPS ) ( 112 , 113 ) . For example , TLR4 may be acti - vated by agents such as high mobility group box 1 ( HMGB1 ) , Tenacin C and various lipids to activate downstream signalling , leading to the production of a variety of proalgesic cytokines ( 64 , 87 , 88 ) . A specific role of TLR4 in me - diating the acute to chronic pain transi - tion in the K / BxN model of arthritis has been described ( 114 ) . In those studies , TLR4 mutant mice ( C3H / HeJ ) devel - oped an inflammation commensurate to the wild type control . In contrast , the TLR4 mutants showed a resolution in their pain state with the resolution of inflammation . This work has been con - firmed using a TLR4 knockout mouse . Additional work has shown that spinal TLR4 signalling can mediate the acute to chronic pain transition . The intrath - ecal administration of a TLR4 antago - nist ( LPS - RS ) during the inflamma - tory phase has no effect on inflamma - tion , but prevents the development of the persistent pain state in a wild type mouse ( 114 ) . It is important to note , however , that this same treatment in the post - inflammatory phase did not affect thresholds , indicating that spinal TLR4 signalling here is specifically mediat - ing the transition from acute to chronic pain . Adaptive immunity Current work is beginning to show that elements associated with adaptive or ac - quired immunity also play a role in per - sistent pain states . Anomalous chronic pain states have been linked to T - cell activation and the release of cytokines from spinal microglia that enhance neuronal activity ( 115 ) . Interestingly , recent evidence indicates that microglia are not required for pain hypersensitiv - ity in female mice . Rather , female mice develop hypersensitivity through the activation of T - lymphocytes ( 116 ) . This sexual dimorphism is only beginning to be investigated , but is a very important subject of current work ( 117 - 119 ) . It appears likely that a variety of chronic pain states as diverse as fibromyalgia ( 120 ) , paraneoplastic syndrome ( 121 ) , and complex regional pain syndrome ( 122 ) may involve autoantibody medi - ated mechanisms . The role of autoanti - bodies in the induction of chronic pain states are of significance and may con - tribute to a pain state by several mecha - nisms . First , it has been shown that IgG immune complexex may initiate a pain state in the rat through an interaction with Fcγ receptors , which have been identified to have stimulatory effects on DRG neurons ( 123 , 124 ) . Alternatively , autoantibodies may be formed against self - epitopes leading to antibody bind - ing to nerves and DRG , complement fixation , and pain . In fact , autoantibod - ies against paranodal proteins leading to complement binding have been asso - ciated with painful inflammatory demy - elinating polyneuropathies ( 125 ) . Addi - tionally , nerve injury may lead to the generation of autoantibodies to nerve injury products such as myelin basic protein leading to hyperpathia in fe - males ( 126 ) . Further , plasma taken from human rheumatoid arthritis patients containing autoantibodies against anti - citrullinated protein antibodies ( ACPA ) can induce pain states independent of inflammation in mice ( 99 , 127 ) . In that study , it was observed that , rather than a direct effect on sensory neurons , ACPA binds CD68 + osteoclasts in the bone marrow and induces CXC - chemokine ligand ( CXCL ) 1 and 2 expression and release from the joints , which then ac - tivates pro - nociceptive receptors on local primary afferents . Importantly , these autoantibodies often appear long before signs of inflammation in rheu - matoid arthritis , and this ACPA – osteo - clast interaction may contribute to the early arthralgia reported by patients . In other conditions , the targeting of au - toantibodies directed at voltage - gated potassium channel complexes leads to neuronal hyperexcitability ( 128 ) . Over - all , there is an emerging and very ex - citing literature on the role of autoan - S - 44 Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 2017 Pathways encoding nociception / S . A . Woller et al . tibodies in generating pain states with chronic inflammatory conditions and after nerve injury indicating , again , a possible mechanistic convergence for the chronic inflammatory with the neu - ropathic pain phenotype . Conclusions Traffic in small afferents leads to a stimulus dependent central processing that is highly aversive . In the face of tissue injury and inflammation , there is the generation of a robust effect on the peripheral terminal that leads to a sensitisation of the peripheral terminal and the generation of ongoing afferent traffic . At the level of the dorsal horn , this input activates second order dorsal horn neurons that encodes the intensity and modality of the stimulus and relays input to higher order centres that give rise to the perceptual experience of pain and drive systems that are associated with complex responses . In the face of injury and inflammation , the persistent afferent input leads to a robust increase in the input / output function and results in modest stimuli being encoded more intensely . Under many circumstances , this input and the attendant pain states will resolve as the injury and inflam - mation are resolved . Under other cir - cumstances , the chronic inflammatory state leads to major changes in the pain phenotype to resemble that produced by nerve injury . While the mechanisms underlying this transition are not clear , current work points to the importance of resident inflammatory cells in the spinal cord and the pivotal role played by systems commonly associated with innate and adaptive immunity . This im - mune signalling appears to play a com - mon role in the evolution of a variety of persistent pain phenotypes . Further understanding of neuroimmune interac - tions will allow for the better treatment or prevention of persistent pain states . References 1 .
