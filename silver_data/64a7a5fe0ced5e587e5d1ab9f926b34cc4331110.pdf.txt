We investigated household secondary attack rate ( SAR ) , transmission dynamics , and contributing factors in households with children . Materials and Methods : In this prospective case - ascertained study in Los Angeles County , California , all households members were enrolled if ≥ 1 member tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . Nasopharyngeal PCRs , serology , and symptom data were obtained over multiple visits . Results : A total of 489 individuals in 105 households were enrolled from June to December 2020 . The majority ( 77 . 3 % ) reported a household annual income of < $ 50 , 000 , and most ( 92 . 9 % ) were of Hispanic / Latinx ethnicity . Children < 18 years old accounted for 46 . 9 % index cases , of whom 45 . 3 % were asymptomatic . Household index cases were predominantly children during low community transmission and adults during the high community transmission period ( χ 2 = 7 . 647 , p = 0 . 0036 . The mean household SAR was 77 . 0 % ( 95 % CI : 69 . 4 – 84 . 6 % ) . Child and adult index cases both efﬁciently transmitted SARS - CoV - 2 within households [ 81 . 9 % , ( 95 % CI : 72 . 1 – 91 . 9 % ) vs . 72 . 4 % ( 95 % CI : 59 . 8 – 85 . 1 % ) , p = 0 . 23 ] . Household income and pets were signiﬁcantly associated with higher SAR in the multivariable analysis of household factors ( p = 0 . 0013 and 0 . 004 , respectively ) . Conclusions : The SAR in households with children in an urban setting with a large ethnic minority population is much higher than previously described . Children play important roles as index cases . SAR was disproportionately impacted by household income . Vaccination and public health efforts need special focus on children and vulnerable communities to help mitigate SARS - CoV - 2 spread .

SARS - CoV - 2 Transmission , Households With Children INTRODUCTION Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) has continued to spread rapidly worldwide , leading to over 4 . 2 million deaths globally ( 1 ) . Although travel and work exposure dominated initial SARS - CoV - 2 spread , household exposure quickly became the principal source of transmission ( 2 , 3 ) . Households are high - risk settings for the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 via respiratory droplets , aerosols , and fomites due to sustained close contact in enclosed indoor settings ( 4 , 5 ) . Published studies show a household attack rate of 47 % and a secondary attack rate ( SAR ) ranging from 6 to 53 percent among household contacts ( 5 – 14 ) , with a mean SAR of 16 . 6 % on a meta - analysis of 44 studies by Madewell et al . ( 5 ) . Previous studies suggest that children under 18 years old are unlikely to be index cases and result in a lower attack rate , that secondary attack rates are higher in adults than children , and that asymptomatic index cases have a limited role in household transmission ( 5 , 15 – 18 ) . The number of Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) cases in children , however , has been on the rise since summer 2020 , paralleling trends among adults ( 19 ) . Many household studies are limited by evaluation of only a few members of the household , focusing primarily on adults in the household , using a cross - sectional or retrospective approach , studying a short period of time , or lacking serologic data . Here we describe a prospective , case - ascertained study of household SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in Los Angeles , California . This is the largest household study in North America to our knowledge , the ﬁrst to report ﬁndings over multiple phases of the pandemic , and one of few studies to focus primarily on households with children in an urban setting . Los Angeles County has been a hot spot of disease burden during this pandemic , with the highest COVID - 19 positivity rate and the most daily new cases per 100 , 000 residents nationwide for most of the winter . Understanding transmission and characteristics of urban households , especially among ethnic minority populations disproportionately aﬀected by COVID - 19 , will help in the development of COVID - 19 prevention and mitigation measures . MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Design and Participants Households in Los Angeles County , California were prospectively enrolled into the Household Exposure and Respiratory Virus Transmission and Immunity Study ( HEARTS ) if at least one household member tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 within 2 weeks prior to enrollment and at least two members living in the household agreed to participate . We recruited households of patients who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles ( CHLA ) using a convenience Abbreviations : CHLA , Children’s Hospital Los Angeles ; CI , Conﬁdence Interval ; CT , Cyclethreshold ; COVID - 19 , Coronavirusdisease2019 ; ELISA , Enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ; FDA , Food and Drug Administration ; IQR , Interquartile range ; NP , Nasopharyngeal ; RBD , Receptor binding domain ; RNP , RnaseP ; RT - PCR , Reverse Transcriptase - Polymerase Chain Reaction ; SAR , Secondary attack rate ; SARS - CoV - 2 , Severeacuterespiratorysyndromecoronavirus - 2 ; SD , Standard deviations . recruitment strategy . These individuals had presented for testing due to COVID - 19 symptoms , known exposure , or in preparation for a routine procedure or hospital admission . Recruitment ﬂiers were also posted at CHLA and at community testing sites near the hospital . We deﬁned a household as all people who occupy a housing unit ; the household may include related family members and unrelated individuals ( 20 ) . At enrollment , a designated household representative responded to a questionnaire detailing household information including the number of household members , type of housing , number of bedrooms and bathrooms , pets , smokers , and household income in the last year . In addition , each consented household member answered an individual questionnaire that included demographic information , co - morbidities , and exposure history . Co - morbidities included pre - existing lung , heart , renal , liver , or neurologic disease , diabetes , cancer or other immunosuppression . Participants logged illness symptoms in a daily symptom diary for 28 days . Parents recorded symptoms for their children . COVID - 19 associated symptoms were deﬁned as at least one of the following : fever , chills , headache , runny nose , congestion , cough , sore throat , shortness of breath , wheeze , altered smell or taste , muscle aches , or gastrointestinal symptoms . Data was recorded in the Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap Consortium , Vanderbilt , Tennessee , USA ) . Participants presented to our drive - thru respiratory testing center for nasopharyngeal ( NP ) swabs performed by trained study staﬀ every 3 – 7 days for up to 4 weeks or until two consecutive negative SARS - CoV - 2 real - time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) results were TABLE 1 | Characteristics of households enrolled in a prospective study of SARS - CoV - 2 household transmission—Los Angeles , California , USA , June – December 2020 .

SARS - CoV - 2 Transmission , Households With Children produced . Blood was collected at the enrollment visit and a convalescent visit after 4 weeks from resolution of the last symptomatic household member . The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles . SARS - CoV - 2 Reverse Transcriptase - Polymerase Chain Reaction We tested for SARS - Cov - 2 using the CDC protocol that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for emergency use authorization ( EUA ) ( 21 ) . RT - PCR was performed using primers and probes that targeted the N1 , N2 , and RnaseP ( RNP , internal control ) genes ( Integrated DNA Technologies , Coralville , IW ) . A positive result was deﬁned as cycle threshold ( CT ) value < 40 for both N1 and N2 . A valid result for SARS - CoV - 2 detection was determined by RNP using a cut - oﬀ of CT value < 32 . An inconclusive result was deﬁned as either N1 or N2 gene detected only with RNP detection . Serology Serum SARS - CoV - 2 receptor binding domain ( RBD ) and spike IgG antibody was measured using an ELISA , as previously described ( 22 ) . A positive cut - oﬀ OD 490 value of 0 . 2 was used for RBD based on the published protocol and the mean of the negative control values plus 3 standard deviations ( SD ) from 20 blood samples collected between 2017 and 2019 . IgG against the spike protein was used to conﬁrm RBD IgG positivity . Deﬁnitions The attack rate of individuals per household was deﬁned as the number of COVID - 19 positive cases during the testing time period divided by the total number of household members . SAR in each household was deﬁned as the number of new cases divided by the total number of at - risk members after subtracting out the index case . We used the earliest date between symptom onset and ﬁrst positive RT - PCR result for each individual to determine the order of infection within a household . The index case was deﬁned as the individual with the earliest onset date for symptoms or positive test in the household . If two members had the same earliest date for symptoms or positive test , they were considered co - index cases . If infection order could not be determined ( e . g . , asymptomatic case determined by acute / convalescent serology ) for any household member , that household was excluded from the SAR analyses .

SARS - CoV - 2 Transmission , Households With Children Statistics Comparisons of categorical variables were calculated using Pearson chi - square . Independent sample T - tests were used for comparison of continuous variables . Multiple linear regression analysis using the forward selection method was used to determine predictors of household attack rate and SAR . Variables were checked for multicollinearity ; if found , only one variable was included in the multivariable model . All remaining factors with p ≤ 0 . 10 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariable analysis . Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Version 27 . 0 ( IBM Corp . , Armonk , NY ) . All tests were 2 - tailed with p < 0 . 05 considered signiﬁcant . RESULTS We enrolled 105 households with 489 individuals from June 17 to December 31 , 2020 , prior to COVID - 19 vaccination roll - out to the general population . Three households were excluded from the analysis because only one member presented for PCR testing . One household was excluded because all members except for the index case had documented COVID - 19 infection > 3 months earlier . The 101 remaining households were included . Of those , 99 enrolled all individuals currently living in the household , two households each missed one individual , and one had two household members excluded due to prior diagnosed COVID - 19 infection > 3 months earlier . Therefore , we included 101 households with 477 individuals in the analysis . Characteristics of the households are shown in Table 1 . Households ranged from 2 to 11 members living together . All except ﬁve households had at least one child under 18 years of age . Almost half ( 46 . 5 % ) of the households had more than two persons per bedroom , meeting the deﬁnition for overcrowding based on the U . S . Department of Housing and Urban Development ( 20 ) . The majority ( 77 . 3 % ) reported an annual household income of < $ 50 , 000 in the last year . SARS - CoV - 2 PCR testing of NP swabs in all 477 ( 100 % ) individuals and serology in 407 ( 85 . 3 % ) individuals were completed at the ﬁrst visit . Individuals followed up for a median of three visits ( IQR , 2 – 4 ) over 15 days ( IQR , 7 – 27 ) . Convalescent serology was obtained in 257 ( 53 . 9 % ) individuals . Overall , 393 ( 82 . 4 % ) tested positive for COVID - 19 by PCR and / or serology at least one time point , six ( 1 . 3 % ) tested inconclusive by PCR with negative serology , and 78 ( 16 . 4 % ) tested negative for both at all time points . The COVID - 19 positive individuals included 216 adults ( 55 . 0 % ) and 177 ( 45 . 0 % ) children . A little over half ( 233 [ 59 . 3 % ] ) of the subjects who tested positive reported COVID - 19 associated symptoms ; 160 ( 72 . 7 % ) tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 after presenting with symptoms , 21 ( 9 . 2 % ) tested positive on the same day of illness onset , and 48 ( 21 . 0 % ) tested positive before developing symptoms . The majority of patients managed their symptoms at home , but two participants required hospitalization for COVID - 19 , and three participants were hospitalized for unrelated reasons . Fewer children were FIGURE 1 | Laboratory - conﬁrmed index cases by age group in participating households compared to Los Angeles County ( LAC ) daily case numbers , June - December 2020 ( 23 ) . Household index cases were predominantly children during low community transmission ( before November 1 , 2020 ) and adults during the high community transmission period ( after November 1 , 2020 ) , χ 2 = 7 . 647 , p = 0 . 006 . symptomatic compared with adults [ 91 ( 51 . 4 % ) vs . 142 ( 65 . 7 % ) , p = 0 . 004 ] . Individual characteristics of all household participants , 113 index cases , and 214 secondary cases are shown in Table 2 . Hispanic / Latinx ethnicity was associated with a higher individual SAR compared to non - Hispanic / Latinx ethnicity ( 80 . 0 vs . 47 . 4 % , p = 0 . 002 ) . This analysis excluded 18 households with 26 asymptomatic cases detected by positive SARS - CoV - 2 serology only for whom infection order could not be determined . Overall , children under 18 years of age accounted for 53 ( 46 . 9 % ) index cases , of whom 24 ( 45 . 3 % ) were asymptomatic . Children index cases were associated with periods of lower community case rates while adult index cases were associated with periods of high community transmission and rapid incidence rise of COVID - 19 cases ( p = 0 . 006 , Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ) . Substantial secondary transmission occurred whether the index patient was an adult or a child [ 81 . 9 % , ( 95 % CI : 72 . 1 – 91 . 9 % ) vs . 72 . 4 % ( 95 % CI : 59 . 8 – 85 . 1 % ) , p = 0 . 23 ] . Symptomatic and asymptomatic index cases both transmitted SARS - CoV - 2 eﬃciently within the household [ SAR : 76 . 7 % ( 95 % CI : 68 . 2 – 85 . 2 % ) vs . 78 . 2 % ( 95 % CI : 59 . 3 – 97 . 2 % ) , p = 0 . 87 ] . Individuals reported last face - to - face contact with conﬁrmed COVID - 19 positive household members a median of 0 days ( IQR , 0 – 0 ) prior to the day of study enrollment , i . e . on the same day , suggesting very close contact in the household . Of the 101 households , 94 ( 93 . 1 % ) had at least one secondary laboratory - conﬁrmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection among household members . All members tested positive in 61 ( 60 . 4 % ) households . The mean household SAR was 77 . 0 % ( 95 % CI : 69 . 4 – 84 . 6 % ) when looking at PCR and serology data together , after excluding those households with any individuals with unknown infection order . If the SAR per household was calculated solely by PCR data , it would be underestimated at 63 . 2 % ( 95 % CI : 55 . 3 – 71 . 2 ) .

In the multivariable model including household income , multiple index cases , ethnicity , and pets [ F ( 2 , 78 ) = 6 . 455 , p = 0 . 003 , R = 0 . 381 ] , only household income and pets signiﬁcantly predicted a higher household SAR . a Ethnicity of the index cases represented the predominant ethnicity in the household . and varying incubation periods ( 24 ) , we performed additional analyses after reclassifying cases within 1 – 5 days of the index case as a sensitivity analysis ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . The SAR remained high above 63 % , even with reclassiﬁcation . In a univariate analysis including all households , income , ethnicity , having multiple index cases , and pets were possible predictors ( p ≤ 0 . 10 ) of a higher household SAR . In the multivariable analysis , only household income and pets remained signiﬁcant factors associated with higher household SAR ( Table 3 ) . The mean attack rate in all households was 83 . 9 ( 95 % CI : 79 . 4 – 88 . 3 % ) . The number of bedrooms , bathrooms , household income , multiple index cases , and Hispanic / Latinx ethnicity were each associated with a higher attack rate in univariate analyses ( Table 4 ) . However , in the multivariable analysis after removing variables with multicollinearity , only the number of bedrooms was found to be a signiﬁcant predictor of higher attack rates in the household . DISCUSSION This study focused on a high predominance of low - income Hispanic / Latinx households with children in an urban setting , a vulnerable group disproportionately aﬀected by the pandemic in the United States . We report the highest recorded mean attack rate of 83 . 9 % within our households and SAR of 77 . 0 % compared with previous household studies ( 5 – 14 ) . Only a few studies have found household SAR over 50 % ( 25 , 26 ) . All members tested positive in 60 . 4 % of our households , showing intense clustering of SARS - CoV - 2 infections within households during periods of low and high community transmission . The number of bedrooms was a signiﬁcant factor in predicting the overall household attack rate in the multivariable analysis . Fewer bedrooms likely decreased the ability to properly quarantine within the living space . Indeed , most participants reported daily face - to - face contact with a known COVID - 19 positive household member , supporting decreased ability to isolate from other household members . Medical sheltering facilities or temporary housing using hotels and motels may be useful for COVID - 19 positive patients for the purpose of isolation to decrease household clusters of infection ( 27 , 28 ) . Lower household income was signiﬁcant in the multivariable analysis to predict a higher household SAR .

In the multivariate model including the number of household members , bedrooms , income , multiple index cases , and ethnicity [ F ( 1 , 98 ) = 5 . 003 , p = 0 . 028 , R = 0 . 220 ] , only the number of bedrooms signiﬁcantly predicted the higher household attack rate ( p = 0 . 022 ) . childcare which we did not capture in our study . Although presence of pets were also associated with higher household SAR and it seems theoretically possible that pets could brieﬂy carry the virus and spread it throughout the household , most studies to - date do not show evidence of pet - to - human transmission ( 29 , 30 ) . Hispanic / Latinx ethnicity was associated with higher individual SAR . This may be due to the large Hispanic / Latinx cohort in our study . Ethnic minority populations are currently at the highest risk of infection , hospitalization , and death from COVID - 19 ( 31 , 32 ) . Multiple data sources have shown a disproportionately high case rate amongst the Hispanic / Latinx population , with a death rate 2 . 3 times higher than the non - Hispanic / Latinx White population ( 31 , 33 ) . The higher attack rates in these communities reinforces the need for vaccination eﬀorts speciﬁcally focused on the lower income and disproportionately aﬀected ethnic minority populations to overcome this large disparity ( 34 , 35 ) . By following our patients over the pandemic , we found that both adults and children are responsible for bringing SARS - CoV - 2 to the household as the index case . A recent population - based cohort study in Canada also found that younger children were more likely to transmit SARS - CoV - 2 infection compared with older children ( 36 ) . During the period with lower case numbers in the community ( 23 ) , we observed that the index cases were most frequently children , despite public school closures . We did not ask households about adherence to community restrictions or childcare practices during school closure , but it is possible that public health measures were not followed as strictly when children were not in school in our study population ( 37 ) . A study in Spain found that children were less likely to be index cases , but higher SAR occurred when children were out of school ( 25 ) . Further studies are needed to determine if children will be important drivers of transmission similar to inﬂuenza ( 38 ) during periods without community restrictions . So far , school reopenings have not been associated with a signiﬁcant increase in COVID - 19 community transmission ( 39 , 40 ) ; risk must be weighed against the signiﬁcant beneﬁt of in - person schooling ( 41 ) . During the largest peak of COVID - 19 cases when community restrictions intensiﬁed in Los Angeles , adults 18 – 54 years of age comprised the highest proportion of index cases . Los Angeles County restriction orders at this time included no in - person dining , decreased capacity for essential and non - essential establishments , and no private or public gathering . Adults in that age group were the most mobile individuals within the household and at the highest risk to acquire SARS - CoV - 2 from work or social contacts outside of the family . Substantial secondary transmission occurred from both child and adult index cases in our households . Other studies have shown a signiﬁcantly lower SAR when the index case is a child ( 16 , 42 ) ; fewer studies have found a higher SAR from Frontiers in Pediatrics | www . frontiersin . org 6 January 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 752993 Tanaka et al . SARS - CoV - 2 Transmission , Households With Children child index cases compared with adults ( 42 ) . Almost a third of our index cases were asymptomatic overall . Of the child index cases , almost half were asymptomatic . Unlike previous studies ( 5 , 11 , 42 , 43 ) , we found that asymptomatic index cases were important transmitters of SARS - CoV - 2 similarly to symptomatic index cases . Individuals who are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms generally remain active and are thus in greater contact with others , increasing the possibility of transmission to the household and community ( 44 , 45 ) . Strengths of the study include capturing and testing entire households including all children , prospectively and repeatedly performing PCR testing on NP swabs over multiple visits to identify cases , and incorporating serologic data into the analysis to catch asymptomatic individuals who may have missed the PCR positivity window . However , the ﬁndings are subject to limitations . The convenience sampling strategy , especially during the pandemic , may cause selection bias . We were unable to determine the infection order in 26 ( 5 . 5 % ) participants who were serologically positive but asymptomatic , which may underestimate the number of asymptomatic index cases . Misclassiﬁcation of index cases is a challenge for SARS - CoV - 2 transmission studies , due to the possibility of diﬀerent incubation time periods and asymptomatic presentation ( 24 ) . We did not perform contact tracing outside of the household to capture the source of infection outside of the household . Only half of the participants returned for convalescent serology ; therefore , we may have missed individuals who developed COVID - 19 immediately before enrollment or during the follow - up period and missed by the NP swab . We could not deﬁnitively diﬀerentiate second cases from subsequent cases in the households ; all were included in the SAR deﬁnition . Almost all patients who were enrolled only had mild illness , and this may underestimate the SAR in households where the index patient was more severely symptomatic . A possibility exists that some of the subsequent household cases were actually acquired outside the household rather than from household transmission , the SAR did not increase during the period of increased community transmission . Viral sequencing was not performed . Cultural practices may play a role in the transmission dynamics for which we did not assess . Households with children in low income , urban communities have an extremely high household SAR . Strategies to decrease household transmission , particularly in ethnic minority communities and low socioeconomic settings , remains crucial to controlling the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic . It is imperative to increase access to resources to make infection prevention , COVID - 19 testing , and following quarantine guidelines possible and less challenging for these populations . Children , both symptomatic and asymptomatic , are important contributors to household spread . Children could be drivers of continued low level community SARS - CoV - 2 circulation in vulnerable populations without vaccination . Future vaccination eﬀorts must include special focus on children and ethnic minority populations , including the households with low income who are disproportionately aﬀected .
