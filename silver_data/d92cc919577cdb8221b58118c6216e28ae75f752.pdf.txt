Itk [ 13 ] . Current Biology 1620 Adhesive defects in Itk - deficient T cells were detect - able only in the presence of antigen , indicating that “inside - out” signaling pathways required for high - avid - ity binding of the (cid:5) 2 integrin LFA - 1 are Itk dependent . Indeed , we find that Rlk (cid:2) / (cid:2) (cid:3) Itk (cid:2) / (cid:2) T cells exhibit defective TCR - activated adhesion to immobilized ICAM - 1 ( L . D . F . and P . L . S . , unpublished data ) . Similarly , overexpression of dominant Itk mutants inhibits TCR - activated adhesion to fibronectin mediated by (cid:5) 1 integ - rins [ 13 ] . Since high - avidity integrin binding requires interaction with cortical actin , it seems likely that the defects in adhesion via (cid:5) 1 and (cid:5) 2 integrins stem from the failure to appropriately remodel F - actin . Itk Is Required for Localized Cdc42 Activation and Downstream Activation of WASP To investigate the molecular basis for the actin defects , we asked whether Itk functions in the cascade leading to WASP activation . This cascade involves localized ac - tivation of Cdc42 , which binds to and induces large conformational changes in WASP , which then activates the formation of branched actin structures by Arp2 / 3 complex [ 14 , 15 ] . WehaveshownthatWASPrecruitment and activation are separable , with recruitment occurring via interactions with SLP76 and Nck , and activation oc - curring via binding to Cdc42 - GTP accumulated at the same site [ 1 , 16 ] . As shown in Figure 3 , WASP and Arp2 / 3 complex were recruited efficiently to the immune synapse in conjugates formed with both wt and Itk - deficient T cells ( either Rlk (cid:2) / (cid:2) (cid:3) Itk (cid:2) / (cid:2) or Itk (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) . The recruitment of Arp2 / 3 complex to the immune synapse is not necessarily a reliable indicator of WASP activation . Though several studies indicate that Arp2 / 3 complex binds only to active WASP [ 14 , 17 ] , there is also evidence for constitutive association [ 18 ] . More - over , Arp2 / 3 complex could be recruited by other pro - teins . To directly address the activation state of WASP , we generated an antibody against an epitope that is masked by intramolecular interactions in the autoinhib - ited conformation and thus specifically recognizes ac - tive WASP ( D . W . L . , C . M . Labno , D . Y . , J . K . B . , and M . K . R . , unpublished data ) . Using this antibody , we observed antigen - dependent WASP activation at the immune syn - apses in wt T cells , but only background levels of activa - tion in Rlk (cid:2) / (cid:2) (cid:3) Itk (cid:2) / (cid:2) T cells ( Figures 3E and 3F ) . WASP activation in Itk (cid:2) / (cid:2) T cells was also significantly lower than in wt controls . Since no defect was evident ( B ) Primary T cell blasts were allowed to conjugate to CMAC ( blue ) - dyed B cells (cid:6) Ag for 10 min , were fixed , and were stained with rhodamine phalloidin to detect F - actin ( red ) . Note the lack of F - actin enrichment at the immune synapse in conjugates formed with the mutant T cells .

Itk - Dependent Activation of Cdc42 and WASP 1621 ( Figure 4C ) . For both wt and Rlk (cid:2) / (cid:2) (cid:3) Itk (cid:2) / (cid:2) T cells , every conjugateshowing Cdc42 - GTPaccumulation also showed accumulation of active WASP ( n (cid:8) 50 conju - gates for each genotype ) . This was not the case when the conformation - unspecific WASP antibody was used to compare overall WASP recruitment with Cdc42 acti - vation ; 24 % of Rlk (cid:2) / (cid:2) (cid:3) Itk (cid:2) / (cid:2) T cells showed recruit - ment of WASP in the absence of Cdc42 - GTP ( n (cid:9) 50 conjugates ) . Thus , in the absence of Itk , WASP can be recruited to the immune synapse without undergoing the conformational changes associated with Cdc42 - induced activation . Itk Is Required for Vav Recruitment to the Immune Synapse The results above suggest that Itk functions upstream oftherelevantguanineexchangefactor ( GEF ) forCdc42 . Although the role of Vav - 1 as a direct GEF for Cdc42 is controversial [ 19 , 20 ] , we recently found that Vav - 1 - deficient Jurkat T cells are defective in Cdc42 activation attheimmunesynapse [ 16 ] . Wethereforeaskedwhether Itk is required for Vav recruitment . Although the back - ground labeling of Vav was high in the absence of anti - gen , antigen - dependent recruitment of Vav was readily measurable in both wt and Rlk (cid:2) / (cid:2) T cells ( Figures 4D and 4E ) . In contrast , antigen - dependent Vav recruitment was completely abolished in T cells lacking Itk . Similar defects wereobtained whenJurkat T cellswere cotrans - fected with an epitope - tagged Vav - 1 construct and siRNA oligonucleotides to inhibit Itk expression . As in Itk (cid:2) / (cid:2) T cells , actin responses were defective and the efficiency of conjugate formation was diminished ( D . Dombroski , C . M . Labno . , J . K . B . , andP . L . S . , unpublished data ) . We conclude that Itk is required for Vav recruit - ment to the immune synapse . Since Itk - dependent phosphorylation of LAT can generate docking sites for Vav [ 21 ] , LAT is a likely intermediary in this process . Itk - dependent phosphorylation of SLP - 76 may also be required , since Vav recruitment requires tyrosine phos - Figure 2 .

Wehave recently described a minimal model for WASP activation [ 12 , 13 , 23 ] . Thus , Vav activity may be regulated in a phosphorylation - independent manner , perhaps as part at the immune synapse involving signaling through TCR , Lck , ZAP - 70 , SLP - 76 , Nck , Vav , and Cdc42 [ 16 ] .
