Shanley Published online : 6 November 2010 (cid:2) Springer Science + Business Media , LLC 2010 Abstract Parents who contacted 1 of 15 children’s mental health agencies in Ontario , Canada reported on where and why they were seeking mental health services for their 4 - to 17 - year - old children . Parents contacted an average of four agencies ( ± 1 . 7 ; range = 1 – 14 ) in the previous year . Approximately one - half of parents were looking for either multiple types of treatment , or help for different problems , across agencies . The complex pattern of help - seeking evidenced in our study likely increases the burden on the mental health care system and on families , and may reduce the likelihood that families will connect with the most appropriate treatment .

Understanding help - seek - ing , or the steps through which families move on their way to receiving treatment , may help to close the gap between those children needing and receiving mental health services ( Durbin et al . 2004 ; Zwaanswijk et al . 2003 ) . Help - seeking can be divided into four major steps : recognizing the problem , deciding to seek help , selecting a source for help , and then accessing care ( Srebnik et al . 1996 ) . Studies using a pathways to care approach ( Gold - berg and Huxley 1980 ) view problem recognition and / or referral from primary care physicians as fundamental in accessing specialized mental health care ( e . g . , Sayal 2006 ; Zwaanswijk et al . 2005 ) . Parents’ problem recognition ( Pavuluri et al . 1996 ) and perceived burden ( Angold et al . 1998 ) have been found to increase the likelihood of a child receiving services , as has receiving a referral from either a primary - care physician or a teacher ( Ford et al . 2005 ; Sayal 2004 ) . However , many children / families receive special - ized mental health services without being referred , sug - gesting that the help - seeking process varies across families and does not follow a linear pathway ( Farmer et al . 2003 ; Ford et al . 2005 ; Godfrey 1995 ; Pavuluri et al . 1996 ; Shanley et al . 2008 ; Zwaanswijk et al . 2005 ) . In some jurisdictions , a formal referral is needed to access spe - cialized mental health services ( Remschmidt et al . 2004 ) . In others such as in Ontario , Canada , although a formal referral is not needed to access most publicly - funded mental health services ( referral from a primary care phy - sician is required for physician specialists including pedi - atricians and psychiatrists ) , a recommendation from a physician or teacher may inﬂuence parents’ help - seeking . Most studies on help - seeking or pathways have focused on the outcomes of receiving a referral or services ( Farmer et al . 2003 ; Ford et al . 2003 ; Hazen et al . 2004 ; Stiffman et al . 2000a ) . This approach cannot inform us about fam - ilies’ efforts to obtain services , which has relevance in understanding the help - seeking process . Only two studies appear to have asked about the mul - tiple sources of help parents could explore in looking for mental health services for their children ( McMiller and Weisz 1996 ; Shanley et al . 2008 ) . McMiller and Weisz ( 1996 ) examined if there were racial differences in those parents who ﬁrst contacted a professional versus a family member or other non - professional in a sample of families who were recruited at intake from one of seven commu - nity clinics . Although all sources of help - seeking were explored , the data analyses did not provide insight into the variety of sources of help sought . Shanley et al . ( 2008 ) examined the number of contacts parents made in seeking help , along with services offered and received , during the previous year in a sample of families recruited at the ﬁrst telephone contact with a centralized intake for three chil - dren’s mental health agencies in one community ; recruit - ment from a single community , however , raises questions about the generalizability of the ﬁndings . After selecting places to seek help , parents may then struggle with accessing services . Within publicly - funded children’s mental health care , waiting lists are common and parents may ﬁnd that services wanted are not available ( Reid and Brown 2008 ; Shanley et al . 2008 ) . In light of such challenges , how much effort do parents expend when they are seeking help ? Do parents accept the services offered to them ? Shanley et al . ( 2008 ) found that parents reported receiving treatment from an average of two agencies and most were in contact with two or more agencies over a 1 - year period . Despite seeking help from multiple locations when trying to obtain services for their children , parents often reported that the treatments offered were not what they wanted due to either their disagreement with the treatment or access barriers ( e . g . , scheduling ) . The Current Study We sought to understand the later steps in the help - seeking processes by focusing on families who were seeking spe - cialized mental health care . To address the limitations of the two previous studies noted above ( McMiller and Weisz 1996 ; Shanley et al . 2008 ) , we recruited parents from mul - tiple agencies and assessed all contacts reported , including those that did not result in any services being offered or received ( i . e . , ‘‘help - seeking’’ ) , with agencies and / or pro - fessionals from all ﬁve service sectors that serve children with mental health problems ( i . e . , mental health , medical , education , child welfare , juvenile justice ) . We use the term ‘‘agency’’ to refer to an organization ( e . g . , children’s mental health center ) , while ‘‘professional’’ refers to an independent practitioner ( e . g . , psychiatrist , psychologist ) . First , we examined where parents sought help for their children . We expected that an examination of help - seeking would result in a greater number of contacts compared to studies that examined only services received ( e . g . , Verhulst and Van der Ende 1997 ; Zwaanswijk et al . 2007 ) . In addition to the number of contacts , we analyzed parents’ help - seeking efforts over time rather than focusing on a single end - point of being referred and / or receiving services ( e . g . , Stiffman et al . 2006 ) . Second , we examined correlates of different patterns of help - seeking within the publicly - funded children’s mental health system . We explored child , family , and community factors that differentiated families who ( a ) were extremely active in their help - seeking efforts , and ( b ) had extended Adm Policy Ment Health ( 2011 ) 38 : 384 – 397 385 123 involvement with mental health services for their children , compared to other families . We focused on these two types of patterns as they reﬂect high levels of effort and involvement by families . Based on the literature on mental health service use , we included the predictors of child sex ( Bussing et al . 2003 ; Sourander et al . 2008 ; Zimmerman 2005 ) , psychological adjustment ( McMiller and Weisz 1996 ) , parents’ perceived impact of child illness ( Angold et al . 1998 ) , single parent status ( Briggs - Gowan et al . 2000 ) , parents’ emotional adjustment ( Verhulst and Van der Ende 1997 ) , and their history of mental health service use ( Wu et al . 1999 , 2001 ) . We also considered the availability of mental health services within the community , which has been recognized as relevant to service planning and delivery ( Bai et al . 2009 ; Blais et al . 2003 ) , but has not been included in previous studies of help - seeking . Third , we examined what happened at each agency that parents contacted . We assessed the problems for which parents were seeking help , and the services they wanted , were offered , and accepted . We focused in depth on treat - ment services offered and accepted , rather than all services ( e . g . , assessment , respite ) , since treatment is a typical result of the process of involvement ( i . e . , intake , assessment , treatment ) at any agency for most families . We expected that barriers ( e . g . , transportation , scheduling ) ( e . g . , Benway et al . 2003 ) would be a common reason for declining services offered . Parents’ expectations of treatment credibility ( i . e . , likelihood that a treatment will result in decreases in their child’s problems ) have been shown to predict treatment attendance and dropout ( Nock and Kazdin 2001 ) . In a pre - vious study from our group ( Shanley et al . 2008 ) , disagree - ment with the approach to treatment was a common reason for declining services offered . We also expected disagree - ment with the approach to treatment would contribute to parents’ initial decision to accept treatment ( s ) offered . Finally , we examined the presenting problems and treatments parents wanted , in order to gain an understand - ing of the process underlying help - seeking patterns . We did this speciﬁcally amongst those who contacted more than one agency for help as these families reﬂect a sub - group who were expending considerable effort in help - seeking . Methods Recruitment Participants were recruited from 15 children’s mental health agencies located throughout the province of Ontario , Canada and accredited by Children’s Mental Health Ontario or a similar accreditation body ( e . g . , Canadian Council on Healthcare Services Accreditation ) . Inclusion criteria were : ( a ) Parent or legal guardian of child contacted the agency , and ( b ) Target child ( i . e . , child with psychosocial problems parent was calling about ) age 4 – 17 years . Exclusion criteria were : ( a ) No phone in the home , ( b ) Parent in a shelter or hospitalized , ( c ) Child with developmental delays or physical disability , ( d ) Parent non - English speaking , ( e ) Third party referral ( e . g . , teacher , family physician ) , or ( f ) Adolescent self - referral . After the standard agency intake interview , staff asked parents if they would release contact information to the researchers and , depending on agency procedures , also completed a measure of child and family adjustment [ Brief Child and Family Phone Interview ( BCFPI ) ( Boyle et al . 2009 ; Cunningham et al . 2009 ) see below ] . A letter of information and a consent form were mailed to interested parents . One week later parents were telephoned to schedule the study interview . We attempted to contact parents multi - ple times before contact efforts ceased ( Traugott 1987 ) ; contacts were attempted 4 times within a 2 - week period at various times ( i . e . , morning , afternoon , evening , weekends ) , and at least 10 attempts over a minimum of 4 and maximum of 6 weeks before being deemed as unable to contact ( n = 92 ) . A total of 506 of 598 parents were contacted . Parents were dropped from recruitment if a parent ( a ) rescheduled or ( b ) was not present for a schedule interview 5 times ( n = 67 , 13 % ) ; 131 ( 26 % ) declined participation . Eight interviews were incomplete and 300 complete inter - views were analyzed . It required an average of 5 ( ± 3 . 2 ) calls to recruit participating parents and the average time between parents contacting the agency and the study interview was 43 days ( ± 29 ; Mdn = 34 ) . Procedures Parents completed a computer - assisted telephone interview that was audiotaped and included demographics , and stan - dardized measures of child and parental adjustment . Parents were asked detailed questions about all contacts made with agencies / professionals during the previous year to obtain help for their child . For participating , parents were mailed a gift certiﬁcate from their choice of three stores or restau - rants . The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at The University of Western Ontario . Staff Training Staff ( individuals with an undergraduate degree or graduate students in clinical psychology ) completed a standardized training protocol for the BCFPI , 2 days of training for conducting interviews , and used a detailed coding manual during the study . To prevent rater drift , inter - rater reli - ability for coded items ( excluding standardized question - naires ) was assessed and reviewed every other month by having all interviewers code a recorded interview . The 386 Adm Policy Ment Health ( 2011 ) 38 : 384 – 397 123 average percent exact agreement was always greater than 86 % . Measures Demographics and Parents’ Treatment History Parents provided demographic data on their child , them - selves and their family and were asked if they had ever been treated for behavioral , emotional or drug or alcohol problems or had treatment for marital problems . Children’s Psychological Adjustment The BCFPI ( Boyle et al . 2009 ; Cunningham et al . 2009 ) was used to measure children’s adjustment . This measure is used in all publicly - funded children’s mental health agen - cies in Ontario . Three scores were derived : externalizing , internalizing and child functional impairment . T - scores were computed using age - and sex - based population norms . Parents’ Psychological Adjustment Parents’ emotional adjustment was assessed using a 6 - item version of the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale ( Radloff 1977 ) , which is part of the BCFPI ( Boyle et al . 2009 ; Cunningham et al . 2009 ) and the role - emotional subscale from the SF - 12 ( Ware et al . 1996 ) . These scales were signiﬁcantly correlated ( r = - . 56 ) . A composite score for parent’s adjustment was the average of z - scores computed for each scale ; higher scores reﬂect poorer emotional adjustment . Impact of Child’s Illness Impact on the family was measured using a subscale from the BCFPI ( Boyle et al . 2009 ; Cunningham et al . 2009 ) that assesses the extent to which the child’s problems affects the family’s external social supports and is a source of conﬂict . T - scores were computed using age - and sex - based population norms . Help - Seeking During Previous Year Parents were asked about all help - seeking contacts in two steps . First , the health care utilization schedule from the Ontario Child Health Study - Revised ( Boyle et al . 1987 ) was administered . Parents reported all medical ( e . g . , family physician ) , mental health ( e . g . , psychiatrist , mental health agency ) , education ( i . e . , teacher , principal , school coun - sellor or other help from the child’s school ) , child welfare , and juvenile justice ( i . e . , police , courts , probation or after - care ofﬁce ) contacts . These categories were supple - mented by a list of location - speciﬁc agencies , which resulted in improved recognition of agencies contacted ( Reid et al . 2008 ) . Second , for each agency contacted , parents were asked : ( a ) how they decided to contact the agency or if someone had contacted them , ( b ) the main problem ( s ) for which they sought help , and ( c ) services wanted , offered , waiting for , received , and rejected . If parents rejected a treatment service , they were asked for the reasons . Parents reported the dates of their ﬁrst and most recent contacts with the agency . Questions and coding of responses were based on existing measures of mental health service use ( Ascher et al . 1996 ; Stiffman et al . 2000b ) and a previous study ( Shanley et al . 2008 ) . Help - seeking efforts across sectors and over time were based on any contact with a sector ( i . e . , mental health , education , medical , child welfare , juvenile justice ) in the previous year . Contacts initiated by parents were separated from contacts initiated by someone from education , child welfare , or juvenile justice . Help - seeking duration within mental health was the number of months between ﬁrst contacting an agency and the date of the study interview . For parents who reported their ﬁrst contact with an agency as over 1 year before the study interview , duration of help - seeking was coded as 13 months ; this was done given that the accuracy of par - ents’ recall of dates more than 1 year prior to the interview was expected to be less reliable than more recent dates . To examine help - seeking over time , for each agency parents contacted we coded the month of ﬁrst contact with the agency ( ‘‘new’’ contact ) separately from all subsequent months in which the family had ongoing involvement ( which could include waiting for , and / or receiving an assessment and / or treatment ) with the agency ( ‘‘ongoing’’ contact ) . Community Characteristics All agencies providing children’s mental health services within each of the communities from which participants were recruited were identiﬁed prior to the study using multiple searches ( e . g . , Internet , telephone ) . Agencies were contacted to conﬁrm that they provided services for chil - dren and to determine their sources of funding . These data were conﬁrmed by an independent survey conducted after the study was completed ( Personal communication , The Provincial Centre of Excellence for Child and Youth Mental Health at CHEO , March , 2006 ) . The number of agencies within 50 km of participating children’s mental health centers was computed based on postal codes ; for two communities in remote locations , a 185 km radius was used as it approximates 2 h travel time , which we felt was an upper limit of one - way travel time for services . Adm Policy Ment Health ( 2011 ) 38 : 384 – 397 387 123 Data Analysis Missing values analysis in SPSS 16 . 0 revealed that data were missing at random . For children missing some BCFPI data ( n = 21 ) , scores were imputed using expectation – maximization procedures . Data were also imputed for participants missing family income , parent education and employment . To assess sample representativeness , chi - square or t - tests were used to compare demographic and child adjustment data for parents and families with data from all children seen at children’s mental health centres across Ontario , and with demographic data from the Ontario 2006 Census ( Statistics Canada 2008 ) . In addition , for children’s adjustment , z - scores for each child’s three BCPFI scores ( i . e . , externalizing , internalizing , impairment ) were com - puted using the means and standard deviations of data from all children seen at the agency from which the family was recruited during the year of study recruitment . The average z - scores for the sample were compared to the normal dis - tribution to determine statistical signiﬁcance ; a z - score C ? 1 . 96 or B - 1 . 96 would indicate that the sample differed signiﬁcantly from the population at P \ . 05 . Help - Seeking Efforts Descriptive statistics were used to examine involvement across all sectors over the previous year . Within the public mental health sector , we examined ( 1 ) the number of new agencies contacted and ( 2 ) agencies with which families had ongoing involvement on a month - by - month basis in the prior year using repeated measures analysis of variance . For ease of understanding this complex process , families were then categorized by combining the number of agen - cies with which they were involved and new agencies contacts during the 3 months prior to the study interview . Given that families varied widely in stage and duration of their help - seeking efforts , use of the date of the interview provided a common reference point across families . For most families , the interview date , compared to the date they ﬁrst initiated help - seeking , was closest to when they contacted the agency from which they were recruited . This allowed for presentation of the data in a manner that would be analogous to having intake staff at an agency inquire about parent’s other help - seeking contacts and thus guide implications for policy and practice . Predictors of Help - Seeking Within the Public Mental Health Sector Two logistic regressions were used to examine predictors of families who ( a ) were very active in help - seeking , and ( b ) had an extended duration of involvement with the mental health system . Predictor variables , selected a priori , included : ( a ) child characteristics ( age , sex , internalizing and externalizing problems , and functional impairment ) ; ( b ) parent characteristics ( marital status , emotional func - tioning , and treatment history ) ; ( c ) impact of child illness on family ; and ( d ) community characteristics ( having more than 10 agencies providing services for children in the area ) . Help - seeking duration was also included as a pre - dictor of active help - seeking . Services Parents were Offered and Accepted Across Sectors The total numbers of services wanted , offered and accepted were computed across all families ( in order to capture the magnitude of families’ efforts ) , along with reasons for rejecting treatment services . Reasons for Multiple Agency Contacts In order to understand why parents contacted more than one agency , we examined the presenting problem ( s ) and treatment ( s ) sought for this subgroup of families across agencies . Although descriptive , these analyses capture some of the reasons for the intensity of parents’ help - seeking . Results Sample Characteristics and Representativeness The majority of parents interviewed were female ( 92 % ) ; 82 % were the child’s birth mother . Single adult households comprised 41 % of families . Families were similar in terms of marital status and parents’ education compared to fam - ilies of children referred to all children’s mental health agencies in Ontario . Compared to the Ontario population , a greater proportion of parents were single parents and born in Canada , family income was less , and parents were less educated ; employment rates were similar ( see Table 1 ) . Children were 10 . 2 years old on average ( 35 % , 4 – 8 years ; 35 % , 9 – 12 years ; 30 % , 13 – 17 years ) . Compared to children referred to all agencies in Ontario , there was a higher percentage of boys in our sample ( 66 % ) and our sample was younger ( see Table 1 ) . In terms of child adjustment , 22 % scored in the clinical range ( T C 70 ; 98th percentile ) for both internalizing and externalizing prob - lems ; 29 % for externalizing only ; and 12 % for internaliz - ing only . Overall , 51 % were in the clinical range for functional impairment . Children’s adjustment did not differ from the agency from which they were recruited ( exter - nalizing z - score M = - . 10 ; internalizing z - score M = . 00 ; 388 Adm Policy Ment Health ( 2011 ) 38 : 384 – 397 123 functional impairment z - score M = - . 07 ) . Further , chil - dren’s adjustment did not differ when compared to 4 – 17 year old children referred to all agencies in Ontario ( see Table 1 ) . Help - Seeking Efforts Involvement by Sector Families were grouped by combinations of sectors con - tacted during the previous year ( see Table 2 ) . Most com - monly , families were in contact with the medical , mental health and education sectors . Only 3 % of families were in contact with only the mental health sector ; 65 % were in contact with three or four sectors , and 11 % were in contact with all ﬁve sectors . We examined who initiated contact in the child welfare , education , and justice sectors . With child welfare , 14 % of parents initiated contact and 22 % were contacted by someone from child welfare . Similarly , 37 % of parents initiated contact with the education sector and 51 % of families were contacted by someone from education . For contacts with juvenile justice , 11 % of parents initiated contact while 12 % were contacted by someone from Table 1 Sample characteristics compared with the Ontario population and Children’s Mental Health Ontario ( CMHO ) sample – Data not available or not applicable a CMHO , data from all agencies afﬁliated with Children’s Mental Health Ontario ( Brian O’Hara , CMHO , personal communication , Oct , 2009 ) b Of the Ontario population aged 15 years and older , unless otherwise speciﬁed c All values are chi - squares comparing sample to CMHO data except for child age and adjustment which are t - test values d All values are chi - squares comparing sample to the data from population of Ontario e Percentages exclude missing data f Of the population who are families ( i . e . , households with at least one child and adult ) g Unemployment is expressed as percent of population including those not in the labour force h T - scores based on population norms * * P \ . 01 ; * * * P \ . 001 Demographic characteristics Studysample CMHO a Ontario b % % Sample vs .

Help - Seeking Over Time Parents’ help - seeking efforts ( i . e . , number of new agencies contacted per month ) within the publicly - funded mental health sector varied signiﬁcantly in the year prior to the study interview ( Pillai - based F ( 12 , 288 ) = 58 . 1 , P \ . 001 ) , as did the number of agencies with which parents had ongoing involvement ( Pillai - based F ( 12 , 288 ) = 46 . 7 , P \ . 001 ) . Seventeen percent of families reported initially seeking help over 1 year before the interview ; below we explore predictors of this long dura - tion of help - seeking . Half of the families ﬁrst contacted an agency within the 2 . 3 months before the study interview ; below we examine help - seeking during the 3 months before the interview . To better understand different patterns of help - seeking , contacts with a new agency and ongoing involvement agencies were combined in each of the 3 months prior to the study interview ( see Fig . 1 ) . A small percent of families were very active in their help - seeking ; in 1 or more of the 3 months prior to the interview , 11 % of families had ongoing involvement with one or more agencies , and had contacted one or more new agencies during the same month . Below we explore predictors and reasons for this pattern of intense help - seeking . Predictors of Help - Seeking Within the Public Mental Health Sector Intense Help - Seeking Compared with the remainder of the sample , the 11 % of families who evidenced a high - intensity pattern of help - seeking in any 1 or more of the 3 months prior to the interview had children with greater impairment ( OR = 1 . 65 ; CI = 1 . 09 – 2 . 51 ) and parents had been seeking help for a longer time ( OR = 1 . 13 ; CI = 1 . 04 – 1 . 23 ; see Table 3 ) . Long Duration of Help - Seeking The 17 % of families who began help - seeking more than 1 year before the study interview did not differ signiﬁ - cantly from the remainder of the parents on any of the child , family or community factors examined ( see Table 3 ) . Services Parents were Offered and Accepted Across Sectors In the year before the study interview , parents con - tacted an average of four agencies or professionals ( ± 1 . 7 ; Mdn = 4 ; range = 1 – 14 ) . In total , these 300 parents contacted 1 , 319 agencies or professionals , across all Table 2 Families’ contact with multiple sectors during the previous year grouped by total number of sectors contacted 4 , Sectors families in contact with Number of sectors Sector n % Mental Health Education Medical Child welfare Justice One or two sectors 4 4 46 15 . 3 4 4 13 4 . 3 4 8 2 . 7 4 4 3 1 . 0 4 4 2 . 7 Three sectors 4 4 4 85 28 . 3 4 4 4 18 6 . 0 4 4 4 13 4 . 3 4 4 4 4 1 . 3 4 4 4 3 1 . 0 4 4 4 1 . 3 Four sectors 4 4 4 4 31 10 . 3 4 4 4 4 23 7 . 7 4 4 4 4 13 4 . 3 4 4 4 4 1 . 3 All ﬁve sectors 4 4 4 4 4 33 11 . 0 n 300 262 194 109 88 % 100 87 . 3 64 . 7 36 . 3 29 . 3 390 Adm Policy Ment Health ( 2011 ) 38 : 384 – 397 123 sectors . Figure 2 is a ﬂow chart showing a breakdown in the types of services offered and accepted across all families . Families were offered a total of 2 , 279 services ; 44 % of services offered were treatments , 35 % were assess - ments , and 21 % were other services ( e . g . , referral ) . Vir - tually all assessments ( 99 % ) and most other services ( 90 % ) offered were wanted by parents . Most treatments offered were wanted ( 89 % ) . Of the 11 % of treatments not wanted , parents accepted 2 % of treatments offered although they did not initially want them , while 9 % of all treatments offered were refused , most commonly because of access barriers ( e . g . , wait too long ) or disagreement with treatment offered . Almost all families ( 94 % ) were offered one or more treatment services . A substantive proportion of families ( 24 % ) declined one or more treatments offered . A vari - ety of types of treatments were declined ( e . g . , 30 % of treatments declined were individual child counsel - ling ; 14 % family therapy ; 12 % parenting group ; 11 % medication ) . Reasons for Multiple Agency Contacts In the year before the study interview , 44 % of parents ( n = 133 ) contacted more than one agency . We examined the problems these parents wanted addressed and the type of treatments wanted . Twenty percent of parents ( 26 / 133 ) were seeking help for different problems at each agency they contacted . For example , the mother of a 15 - year - old girl contacted one agency with concerns about depression and another agency with concerns about an eating disorder . However , most commonly ( 68 % ; 91 / 133 ) , parents were seeking help for the same problem at each location they contacted . Yet amongst these parents , 28 % ( 25 / 91 ) were seeking different treatments for the same problem at each of the agencies they contacted . For example , the mother of an 8 - year - old boy contacted two agencies seeking help for anger problems . At the ﬁrst agency , she was looking for group treatment while at the second agency she wanted individual counselling for her child and counselling for herself . The remaining 12 % ( 16 / 133 ) of parents were either looking for help for the same problem at some but not all agencies contacted , or different types of treatment at some but not all agencies . Overall , 50 % of parents were looking for either different types of treatment , or help for different problems , across agencies . Discussion We found more complex patterns of help - seeking among parents of children with mental health problems than described in previous studies . Virtually all families were involved with multiple sectors and we found that parents contacted an average of four agencies and / or professionals across sectors in the previous year . Many families were simultaneously involved with multiple agencies with about half of parents having looked for either multiple different types of treatment , or help for different problems , across agencies . Some families had ongoing involvement with mental health services beginning over a year prior to the study interview . A qualitative study of parents’ experiences in accessing mental health care for children in rural Ontario concluded : ‘‘The notion of ‘pathway’ to care is misleading as it implies a linear process … It is more like a labyrinth or a tangled web than a ‘pathway’’’ ( Boydell et al . 2006 , p . 15 ) . The results from the current study suggest the same is true across Ontario and are similar to the results from a previous study of a single community ( Shanley et al . 2008 ) . Fami - lies’ behavior is likely due to both system ( e . g . , lack of co - ordination across agencies , waiting lists ) ( Boydell et al . 2009 ) and family factors ( e . g . , barriers in scheduling appointments ) . We found that how families seek help is 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 3 2 1 Months before interview % o f P a r e n t s p e r M on t h 2 + new and 0 ongoing 1 new and 0 ongoing 0 new and 2 + ongoing 0 new and 1 ongoing 2 + new and 1 + ongoing 1 new and 1 + ongoing Fig . 1 Patterns of new contacts and ongoing involvement with agencies within the public mental health sector . Percents were calculated by month prior to the interview ( N = 300 ) . Bars are stacked to reﬂect increasing levels of involvement . New = contact with a new agency occurred during the month ; Ongoing = some involvement with an agency during the month , which could include waiting for or receiving an assessment or treatment . In the month prior to the interview , 54 % of families had ongoing involvement with one agency and 13 % with two agencies but did not contact a new agency . Thirteen percent of families had a contact with one and 4 % with two new agencies but no ongoing involvement with other agencies . A small percentage of parents had both ongoing contact with one or more agencies and contacted one ( 4 % ) or two ( 1 % ) new agencies Adm Policy Ment Health ( 2011 ) 38 : 384 – 397 391 123 substantially more complex than what has been found in studies examining only contacts resulting in service use ( e . g . , Farmer et al . 2003 ; Pavuluri et al . 1996 ) . This complexity is not consistent with a more linear model of help - seeking ( e . g . , Goldberg and Huxley 1980 ) .

Predictors of Help - Seeking Within the Public Mental Health Sector Intense Help - Seeking A small percentage of families had intense patterns of help - seeking ; they were simultaneously involved with multiple agencies and were seeking additional help . These families had children with greater impairment and parents had been seeking help for longer periods of time . Chil - dren’s impaired functioning may increase parents’ efforts at help - seeking , or parents themselves may be receiving pressure from others , such as teachers , to ﬁnd help for children who are struggling . The positive relationship between duration and intensity of help - seeking may reﬂect a system characterized by long waiting lists ( Reid and Brown 2008 ) . The longer families wait , the more frus - trated parents may become , which may lead them to contact other agencies . Long Duration of Help - Seeking Almost one in ﬁve ( 17 % ) families had been involved in the mental health system for more than 1 year . This is similar to a community sample in the United States in which 14 % of youth ( 9 , 11 , or 13 years old ) used services for 12 months or more ( regardless of sector ) over a 3 - year period ( percent among children with some service use ) ( Farmer et al . 2003 ) . These children may be best concep - tualized as needing ongoing care or from a chronic illness model of pathology , rather than an acute illness model . Understanding the prevalence and correlates of patterns of service use ( e . g . , acute , episodic , continuous ) over longer periods of time ( e . g . , across childhood ) should aid policy and practice . However , none of the predictors we examined differentiated families with this ongoing pattern of involvement from the rest of the sample . In two other studies using community - and clinic - based samples , pre - dictors of persistence of service use were identiﬁed , but results differed between studies ( Farmer et al . 1999 ; Ortega et al . 2007 ) . The lack of signiﬁcant predictors in the present study may be due to differences in system factors that were not measured , the samples , the outcome ( help - seeking vs . service use ) , deﬁnitions of ongoing use ( which combines both waiting and receiving services ) , or may simply indi - cate that seeking mental health service is a varied and complex process . Services Offered and Accepted Across all agencies and sectors , 24 % of families declined at least one treatment that was offered . Access issues and disagreement with the approach to treatment were the most common reasons . Access barriers are known predictors of non - attendance at initial appointments ( Sayal 2006 ) and treatment dropout ( Kazdin and Wassell 2000 ) . Treatment expectations and attributions of child behavior also relate to treatment engagement and dropout ( Kerkorian et al . 2006 ) . The 3 % of treatment services declined due to a disagreement with the approach to treatment is lower than a previous study in one community ( 27 % of all treatments offered ) ( Shanley et al . 2008 ) . Disagreement with the approach to treatment has not been widely studied but should be further examined . Reasons for Multiple Agency Contacts Across all sectors , families were , on average , in contact with four service providers over 1 year , and 44 % of fam - ilies contacted two or more agencies within the public mental health sector . Data on the number of help - seeking contacts has not previously been reported in children’s mental health . Among parents who contacted multiple agencies , 50 % sought help in different places for different problems or were seeking different treatments for the same problem . Differential help - seeking as a function of problem type or desired treatment has , to our knowledge , not been previously examined . Other factors that could affect par - ents’ decisions to seek help in multiple places need to be considered in future studies including treatment outcomes and excessive wait times for services . This pattern may also reﬂect the publicly - funded system in Ontario in which families can use a wide range of services at no direct ﬁnancial cost for the services . Limitations Help - seeking and service contacts were based solely on parent report . Although parents’ reports of mental health service utilization are valid and reliable ( Bean et al . 2000 ; Glisson and Green 2006 ) , we did not assess the relationship between parent reports and agency records . This would be impossible for contacts when no services were received , as identifying information is not collected for these families . The use of parent report and our participant selection cri - teria also excluded youth who self - referred for help . Although youth who self - refer would be a small minority amongst all families of children and youth who seek help , this subgroup is worth examining as they may face more barriers to seeking and accessing care given the likely lack of parental support . Adm Policy Ment Health ( 2011 ) 38 : 384 – 397 393 123 Our study selection criteria excluded children in the care of child welfare and those with development disabilities . Both groups are known to have a high prevalence of mental health problems ( Burns et al . 2004 ; Ford et al . 2007 ; Witt et al . 2003 ) . There is some evidence that both groups are more likely to use mental health services compared to children without these problems ( Burns et al . 2004 ; Douma et al . 2006 ; Glisson and Green 2006 ; Horwitz et al . 2003 ; Witt et al . 2003 ) . These groups were excluded as their options for care and the role of parents in seeking care are different that children without these issues . The exclusion of parents who did not speak English sufﬁciently well to be interviewed and those who did not have a telephone or were in a shelter are further limitations . Families with these characteristics are less likely in general to seek mental health care for their children ( Cunningham et al . 2000 ) and if they did , would likely have more difﬁculties in obtaining appropriate services than other families . The challenges these high - risk children and their families / caregivers face in seeking mental health services needs further study . Many of the parents contacted did not participate in the study . We found few signiﬁcant differences between the parent and child demographic and clinical characteristics of the study parents compared to the entire population of families seen in children’s mental health centers in Ontario . As other studies on mental health services utilization using both community - and mental health clinic - samples have reported participation rates of 40 % ( Sayal 2004 ) , 50 % ( Hazen et al . 2004 ) and 60 % ( Zwaanswijk et al . 2007 ) , it may be that recruitment with this population is simply very challenging . However , we do not know about potentially important differences in the help - seeking experiences of those families we could not contact or who chose not to participate . If these families who did not participate had fewer economic , social , or interpersonal resources and / or more mental health difﬁculties , it would not be surprising if these factors also impacted their help - seeking efforts . Implications Access to Care and System Reform Parents’ diffuse help - seeking efforts resulted in 300 fami - lies being offered over 2000 services . Publicly - funded agencies often reduce services for ﬁscal reasons , resulting in decreased availability of services and / or increased waiting times ( Reid and Brown 2008 ) . Families may respond by seeking services across multiple agencies , and a lack of co - ordination across agencies likely contributes to families’ involvement with multiple agencies ( Boydell et al . 2009 ) . The increased burden on families involved with multiple agencies and the greater number of choices , reduces the likelihood that parents will connect and engage with the most appropriate treatment . Involvement with multiple agencies would also reduce families’ available time and energy , which could cause them to avoid treat - ments that require greater effort , but are potentially more effective . Multiple involvements also reduce the likelihood of achieving a critical dose of treatment from any single agency ( Angold et al . 2000 ) . This help - seeking pattern adds costs across the system , and likely results in an inequitable distribution of services ; if the most persistent parents use services at multiple agencies , resources may not be available for other families . Finally , as has been shown within hospitals ( e . g . , Greenberg et al . 2007 ) , mul - tiple ‘‘handoffs’’ ( e . g . , referrals ) may increase the risk of adverse clinical events . Obtaining the most appropriate service as soon as possible with minimal number of ‘‘handoffs , ’’ both within and between agencies , should increase families’ engagement while minimizing the risk of mistakes , decreasing families’ frustration , and potentially lowering costs to both families and to the system . Problems with accessing care were apparent , suggesting that wide - scale restructuring of the children’s mental health care ‘‘system’’ in Ontario is needed . Within health care , hospital amalgamation was a trend decades ago ( Sochalski et al . 1997 ) . Similarly in larger communities , consolidation of smaller agencies may improve access through central - ization . In the absence of large - scale system reform , fam - ilies need assistance in their help - seeking , starting at their point of contact with the ‘‘system . ’’ Family physicians , who are often the ﬁrst professional families turn to ( Hadley et al . 2002 ) , may play an important role in this regard . In larger communities , a single point of access for intake may help parents ﬁnd the correct agency and facilitate appro - priate referrals to specialty ‘‘clinics . ’’ In smaller commu - nities with a single agency , families may need assistance in accessing specialized services not available locally . New Models of Care Most families ( 76 % ) contacting agencies for help were in contact with three or more sectors during the previous year . Population - based studies in the U . S . have shown that 45 % of youth who received services did so from multiple sectors within a 3 - year period ( Farmer et al . 2003 ) . The agency of ﬁrst clinical involvement is probably the most appropriate to assist in managing cross - sectoral co - ordination . To facilitate this process , a family’s involvement with other agencies and other sectors needs to be routinely assessed ( Reid et al . 2008 ) . Staff could encourage families to select one agency with which to engage , although this might require shorter wait lists to be effective . Families already involved with multiple sectors may require service co - ordinators ; the family advocate model seems relevant ( Hoagwood 2006 ) . A criterion of contact with four or ﬁve 394 Adm Policy Ment Health ( 2011 ) 38 : 384 – 397 123 sectors ( 15 % of families in the present study ) would be a reasonable starting point . Although wraparound models reﬂect a ‘‘systems - of - care’’ approach ( Stroul and Friedman 1994 ) that these children need , these models provide intense supports only to selected families with complex needs [ e . g . 1 % of children within child welfare or juvenile justice ( Yeh et al . 2002 ) ] . New models of service co - ordination are needed given the large proportion of families seeking mental health services that are involved with multiple sectors .
