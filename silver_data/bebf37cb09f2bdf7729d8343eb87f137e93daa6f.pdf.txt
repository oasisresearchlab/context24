To provide a systematic analysis of genes that regulate epithelial cell migration , we performed a high throughput wound healing screen with MCF - 10A breast epithelial cells , using siRNAs targeting 1 , 081 human genes encoding phosphatases , kinases and proteins predicted to influence cell migration and adhesion . The primary screen identified three categories of hits : those that accelerate , those that inhibit and those that impair migration with associated effects on cell proliferation or metabolism . Extensive validation of all the hits yielded 66 high confidence genes that , when downregulated , either accelerated or impaired migration ; 42 of these high confidence genes have not been previously associated with motility or adhesion . Time - lapse video microscopy revealed a broad spectrum of phenotypic changes involving alterations in the extent and nature of disruption of cell – cell adhesion , directionality of motility , cell polarity and shape , and protrusion dynamics . Informatics analysis highlighted three major signalling nodes , β - catenin , β 1 - integrin and actin , and a large proportion of the genes that accelerated migration impaired cell – cell adhesion . Cell migration is central to development and tissue remodelling and has a major role in cancer and metastasis . Many genes regulate mam - malian cell migration ; some are clearly involved in the mechanics of the process , whereas others mediate receptor - driven regulatory pathways . These genes have been identified by targeted investigations or through unbiased genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster 1 , 2 . The development of small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) technology has made it feasible to perform genetic screens in mammalian cells . We used a high throughput siRNA screening approach to identify genes involved in epithelial cell migration , focusing on the generation of a highly validated dataset . This contrasts with the general strategy of selective analysis of a few strong hits with minimal validation of the majority of primary hits 3 – 6 . We used an immortalized , non - tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line , MCF - 10A , because of its strong migratory response to EGF , its relative homogeneity , compared with tumour cell lines , and its ability to form an epithelial sheet when confluent . The screen was based on the classical scratch - wound assay 7 . This assay is well recognized for assessing epithelial cell motility . It allows visualiza - tion of morphological features and has the potential to identify siRNAs that promote escape from the epithelial sheet , a property associated with tumour - cell dissemination . Three siRNA libraries were screened ; the human phosphatase and kinase libraries were chosen because these enzyme families regulate many cellular pathways . The third , a custom library designed in collaboration with the Geiger Laboratory ( Weizmann Institute , Israel ) targeted expanded family members of genes with known or predicted roles in migration or adhesion ( migration and adhesion related , MAR ) . We identified 34 genes that have a negative regulatory role in migra - tion , 32 that have a positive role and 29 that affected cell metabolism . Forty - two of the high confidence hits have not previously been impli - cated in cell migration . Informatics analysis implicated many of the hits in cell – cell and cell – matrix adhesion through involvement in β - catenin and β1 - integrin pathways , regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and EGFR signalling . This screen provides a resource of high confidence data , annotated at the level of migration effects , cell morphology fea - tures , patterns of motility over time and pathway interactions . A fully interactive database is hosted by the Cell Migration Consortium ( www . cellmigration . org / pubs / wound _ rnai . htm ) . RESULTS Screen overview To screen for motility in high throughput , we developed a robotic - driven pin to deliver a precise scratch in confluent cell monolayers . The assay conditions were established using siRNAs targeting RHOA and RAC1 ( refs 8 , 9 ) and wound healing was evaluated after 12 h when the mock - transfected cells , migrating collectively as an epithelial cell sheet , close the wound by 50 – 60 % ( Fig . 1 ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) . The extent of motility , termed the ‘area score’ , was numerically quanti - fied and a visual evaluation was also performed to provide a secondary 1 Department of Cell Biology , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts , 02115 . 2 Dharmacon , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Colorado , 80026 , USA . 3 Current address : The Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute , Smorgon Family Building , St Andrews Place , East Melbourne 3002 , Victoria , Australia 4 Correspondence should be addressed to J .

( a ) Representative wound healing images indicate the continuum of phenotypes , together with the normalized wound area and Alamar Blue scores . siRNAs were binned on the basis of the area score , visual score and Alamar Blue score . Accelerated bin ( green ) had an area score of < 0 . 75 and visually was considered closed or closing . Impaired bin ( red ) had an area score of > 2 . 0 and no effect on metabolism ( Alamar Blue score > 0 . 8 ) . Low Alamar bin had poor Alamar Blue reduction ( < 0 . 8 ) and generally disrupted monolayer integrity . siRNAs that induced numerical scores bordering the cut - offs were visually inspected and binned appropriately . On occasion , the numerical score could inaccurately reflect wound closure due to small tears in the monolayer , variations in cell morphology or cell dissociation . From the SMARTpool screen , 11 . 8 % of the Accelerated bin and 34 % of the Impaired bin scores were visually overridden . The phalloidin channel montage is shown in grey scale .

All rights reserved . A RT I C L E S assessment of motility . To assess cytotoxicity or reduction in cell number , we measured cellular reducing activity using Alamar Blue immediately before wounding . The phosphatase library targeted 192 genes , the kinase library targeted 576 protein and phosphotidylinositol kinases and the MAR library targeted 313 genes ( Supplementary Information , Table S1a – c ) . The screen schema is outlined in Supplementary Information , Fig . S1c . Using both SMARTpool siRNA reagents ( herein termed SMARTpool ) and two individual siRNAs for the primary screen , the siRNAs were classified into hit categories on the basis of migration - specific phenotypes . Detailed validation included screening four individual sequences , quantification of gene knockdown and addressing potential off - target effects . All hits were also re - screened in an additional cell line . Subsequent analysis included examination of cell mor - phology and time - lapse video microscopy . Bioinformatics analysis was per - formed to evaluate the coupling of the genes into pathways or networks . Primary siRNA screen The continuum of wound healing phenotypes and the numerical cut - off value for classification of each hit bin is shown in Fig . 1a . Representative images of the wound region and cell morphology for each SMARTpool - transfected cell population are shown online ( www . cellmigration . org / pubs / wound _ rnai . htm ) . One hundred and one SMARTpools induced an Accelerated migration phenotype ( 9 . 3 % of total ) , 202 Impaired ( 18 . 7 % ) and 154 Low Alamar ( 14 . 2 % ; Fig . 1b ) . Contribution of each library to the hit bins varied but only the kinase and MAR libraries showed signifi - cant enrichment of migration hits ( P = 0 . 02 and P = 0 . 005 , respectively ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S2a , b ) . In addition to the SMARTpools , we initially screened two of the four individual siRNAs from each pool . This provided a preliminary assessment of the validity of the SMARTpool screen and focused subsequent validation strategies . Scoring for phenotypic agreement with the SMARTpool , siRNAs targeting 394 genes ( 36 . 4 % ) showed consensus with the SMARTpools for both siRNAs : 415 ( 38 . 4 % ) had one concordant siRNA and 272 ( 25 . 2 % ) no concordance ( Fig . 1b ; Supplementary Information , Table S2a – c ) . Evaluation of SMARTpool siRNA efficacy by knockdown Limited data exists for analysis of gene knockdown under siRNA screen - ing conditions . Using branched DNA ( bDNA ) technology , we evaluated knockdown before wounding for most of the kinase and phosphatase genes . We found that 42 % of the SMARTpools ( 321 ) downregulated their target genes by more than 70 % ( see www . cellmigration . org / pubs / wound _ rnai . htm for details ) . The average knockdown was 67 . 8 ± 22 . 3 % ( mean ± s . d . , n = 762 ) and did not differ between any hit bin , indicat - ing that the siRNA targeting was effective regardless of the phenotype ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S2c , d ) . The knockdown data was valuable for an overall perspective of the siRNA reagent efficiency under screening conditions ; however , the level required to detect a phenotype depends on the target gene , the complexity of the phenotype and sensitiv - ity of the assay 10 . As this screen followed a complex phenotype without optimization for individual genes , we have used this data as supportive information relating to the ability of the siRNA to target the gene , and not the primary criteria to define confidence in a particular siRNA . Validation of siRNAs from the Accelerated and Impaired bins Focusing in greatest detail on the Accelerated migration bin , we screened all four individual siRNAs from each SMARTpool three times and scored for phenotypic concordance . High confidence ( HC ) siRNAs were defined as those that scored a consensus 3 / 4 or 4 / 4 with the SMARTpool and Moderate confidence ( MC ) siRNAs scored 2 / 4 . Twenty - nine ( 28 . 7 % ) siRNAs scored with HC , 32 ( 31 . 6 % ) scored with MC , 31 scored 1 / 4 and nine scored 0 / 4 ( Fig . 1b ; Table 1 ; Supplementary Information , Table S2a ) . For the 20 HC siRNAs that scored 3 / 4 , the outlier sequence had no effect . Each of the phenotypic concordance subgroups from the initial screen of two siRNAs gave rise to HC and MC genes ( Fig . 1b ) , with most of the HC hits derived from the 2 / 2 bin . However , excluding the 0 / 2 siRNAs would have ignored validated hits , thus screening four individual sequences is optimal for identifying HC hits . A similar approach was taken for the Impaired migration bin . However , because of limited siRNA availability , we performed a single screen of all four siRNAs from the SMARTpools that scored 1 / 2 or 2 / 2 in the initial screen . Thirty - two siRNAs validated with HC ( 15 . 8 % of the Impaired bin ) , 48 ( 23 . 8 % ) with MC , 45 scored 1 / 4 and 20 scored 0 / 4 ( Fig . 1b ; Table 1 ; Supplementary Information , Table S2b ) . The siRNAs that scored 2 / 2 from the Low Alamar bin were designated as MC ( Fig . 1b ) . The indi - vidual siRNAs that validated and associated sequence information are indicated online ( www . cellmigration . org / pubs / wound _ rnai . htm ) . The Impaired migration phenotype was most prevalent in the SMARTpool screen , probably because of the complexity of the migration process and the possibility that non - specific toxicity can negatively affect migration . However , validation of the Accelerated bin produced a sig - nificantly higher proportion of HC genes , compared with the Impaired bin ( 28 . 7 % versus . 15 . 8 % , P = 0 . 008 ) . Addressing potential off - target effects Off - target effects are inherent to siRNA technology and result from several mechanisms 11 . To further address the validity of the siRNA hits , we assayed ON - TARGET plus ( OTP ) SMARTpools , targeting all HC Accelerated bin genes and a small subset of MC genes . OTPs have been shown to reduce off - target effects 12 , 13 . Target mRNA knockdown aver - aged 70 . 6 ± 19 % ( mean ±s . d . , n = 16 ) , which is similar to the standard SMARTpools . Twenty - three OTP siRNAs induced accelerated migration , albeit with generally weaker phenotypes ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S3 ) , providing further validation of these HC hits . In addition , this analy - sis upgraded five genes that had previously scored with MC ( CDC2L5 , DDEF1 , MYLK , NEDD9 , STK40 ) . We did not downgrade those genes that failed to show a phenotype because the OTPs had not been optimized for the original screening conditions and further studies are required to confirm negative results . Knockdown validation of a subset of the Accelerated genes To address whether mRNA knockdown correlates with phenotype , mRNA levels for all four individual siRNAs were assessed in parallel with wound - ing . We observed variability in the extent of mRNA downregulation by each siRNA targeting a single gene ( Fig . 2a ) . siRNAs targeting CTNND1 ( 4 / 4 ) , induced consistent morphology and highly efficient knockdown at the mRNA and protein levels ( Fig . 2 ) . All sequences for ACVR1 and CDH3 induced at least 60 % knockdown , with CDH3 siRNAs targeting the protein efficiently ( Fig . 2a , b ) . All ADCK4 siRNAs accelerated migration and altered morphology , but three targeted less than 60 % . Although this questions the validity of the phenotype , additional reagents targeting ADCK4 ( OTP and two shRNA vectors ( see Supplementary Information , Discussion ) ) also accelerated migration , suggesting that the effects are on - target ( Fig . 2c ) . nature cell biology volume 10 | number 9 | SePTember 2008 1029 © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

All rights reserved . A RT I C L E S For the 3 / 4 HC genes , the non - concordant siRNA targeted the mRNA but did not alter migration ( CTNNB1 , PFN2 , RHOA ; Fig . 2 ) . RHOA siRNA1 targeted the mRNA efficiently but was less effective at protein knockdown and induced weaker morphological changes . Ineffective protein knockdown may also explain the lack of phenotypic concord - ance for other siRNAs . Failure of the non - concordant siRNAs to enhance migration may be due to a suppressive off - target effect that neutral - izes increased migration . This seems plausible given that CTNNB1 and RHOA have well documented roles in migration 14 , 15 and we have signifi - cant experimental validation . The average knockdown for the HC and MC genes did not differ ( 66 . 5 ± 21 . 7 % versus 64 . 3 ± 20 % , mean ± s . d . , n = 13 and 9 , respectively ) .

All rights reserved . A RT I C L E S However , the MC and 1 / 4 genes failed to show a correlation between knockdown and phenotype , diminishing our confidence that these effects are on target and suggesting that two concordant siRNAs are insufficient for validation ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S4a , b ) . Classification of screen results Integrating the SMARTpool screen with the individual siRNA and OTP validation data , each gene was assigned to a final hit bin : HC ( 3 / 4 or 4 / 4 concordance ) , MC ( 2 / 4 or 2 / 2 concordance ; Fig . 1b ) or Discordant ( 0 / 4 , 1 / 4 , 0 / 2 , 1 / 2 ; Supplementary Information , Tables S2a – c ) . The Discordant siRNAs did not validate with confidence on the basis of differences between the SMARTpool and individual siRNAs , or replicate reproducibility . The siRNAs that induced a No Change phenotype and validated with MC were termed No Phenotype ( NP ) . We identified 66 HC genes that Accelerate and Impair migration and studied these in greater detail ( Table 1 ) . Distinguishing morphological features induced by the HC Accelerated and Impaired genes We observed a diverse range of morphologies at the wound edge , particu - larly in the Accelerated bin , with almost two thirds showing significantly altered cell – cell adhesion , ranging from disruption of cell – cell contact at the wound edge and monolayer , to dissociation only at the wound edge ( Fig . 3a ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S5a ) . siRNAs that impaired migration induced limited morphological variability , although several induced some loss of cell – cell contact at the wound edge ( Fig . 3b ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S5b ) . Only 3 . 8 % of the Impaired and 1 % of the No Change bin showed weak morphological changes . To investigate the alterations responsible for accelerated or impaired migration , we used time - lapse imaging during wound healing . The videos from this analysis , as well as a progression of cropped static images , and annotation of parameters such as cell morphology , lamel - lae and lamellipodia protrusion dynamics , speed , direction and the extent of cell – cell adhesion can be found online ( www . cellmigration . org / pubs / wound _ rnai . htm ) . The Accelerated genes were divided into seven groups ( A – G , with four exceptions that had unique and unclas - sifiable properties ) and the Impaired genes into five groups ( A – E , with two exceptions ; Table 1 ; Supplementary Information , Tables S3 , S4 ) . A representative from each Accelerated group ( indicated by # ) was char - acterized by tracking the migration pattern of eight independent cells ( Fig . 4 ) . A selected cell was then graphed to show directionality and persistence ( x - and y - axis motility ; Fig . 3c ) .

The leading edge of a migrating cell can be distinguished as lamellae and lamellipodia using probes specific for cytoskeletal proteins , or electron microscopy 16 . However , as we were unable to differentiate these compartments in our time - lapse images , we refer to the dynamic structures at the leading fronts collectively as protrusions . After wounding , control cells extended small to medium protrusions into the open space . The monolayer was reoriented towards the leading edge and forward movement began approximately 6 h later . The cells polarized , with nuclei localized to the trailing edge and protrusions at the leading front , and maintained contact throughout the migration period . Cells transfected with Accelerated Groups A , B and C showed significant alterations in cell – cell adhesion and were distinguished by the extent and nature of adhesion impairment , directionality of movement , alterations in cell polarity and leading edge morphol - ogy and dynamics . Within 1 h of wounding , Group A genes ( CDH3 , CTNND1 # ) induced cell dissociation and rapid , persistent directional migration , with clear front – rear polarity . Group B siRNA transfected cells ( DOCK6 # , PRKACA ) showed transient cell – cell adhesions in the monolayer , front – rear polarity and persistent , directional migration , losing adhesion as they filled the wound . Cells transduced with siRNAs targeting Group C , comprising 13 genes ( ADCK4 , CDC14C , CSNK1E , CSNK1G2 # , DDEF1 , GJA1 # , NEK8 , PPP1R1B , PRKCH , STK40 , STXYL1 , TPD52L3 ) showed minimal cell – cell adhesion , rapid and very erratic migration and poor front – rear polarity . At wounding , cells were organ - ized as an adherent monolayer that dissociated during closure . Single cells migrated rapidly , changed direction frequently , showed defects in retraction and the formation of large tails , and displayed multiple protrusions per cell . A diverse range of leading edge protrusion features were observed , from quite small ( for example , PPP1R1B , STK40 ) to narrow and extended ( for example , NEK8 , PRKCH ) and extremely large and broad ( for example , CSNK1E , GJA1 ) .

A RT I C L E S speeds similar to those seen during wound healing ( data not shown ) . Therefore , the erratic , non - polarized behaviour of dissociated single cells is specific for the knockdown and not a consequence of separation from the monolayer . Groups D – G siRNA - transduced cells migrated collectively and were distinguished by effects on cell – cell adhesion , morphology of the monolayer and leading - edge cells . Group D ( CDC2L5 , DUSP18 , FMN1 # , MYLK , PTPRO , SRPK2 ) transduced cells showed large , broad protrusions , especially in leader cells directing migration , and tran - sient cell – cell adhesion . Group E ( ADAM17 , ADCK1 # ) cells induced medium - sized protrusions , whereas Group F ( LTK , NEDD9 # , VEGFC ) cells were distinguished by a compact monolayer . Group G ( TAF1 , NF1 ) cells differed from controls only in speed . RHOA # , RIOK2 , ACVR1 and CTNNB1 siRNA - transduced cells showed unique migration patterns . Knockdown of RHOA induced elongated , mesenchyme - like cells that maintained minimal adhesion and showed some degree of vertical migration . RIOK2 knockdown cells polarized with small protrusions , maintained adhesion in the monol - ayer and moved less erratically than Group C cells . ACVR1 knockdown cells maintained adhesion and showed a mixture of non - polarized and polarized cells . Knockdown of CTNNB1 enlarged cell size , slightly dis - rupted adhesion and provoked some cell death towards the end of the wounding period . Impaired Group A siRNAs ( CSNK2A2 , PTPN6 ) induced highly motile cells with erratic movement and minimal cell – cell adhesion but failed to move forwards . Group B ( CAMK2B , DMPK , VEGFB ) siRNAs induced vertical cell movement associated with asymmetric cell – cell adhesion . Group C ( ENPP5 , LOC390975 , RSU1 ) transduced cells were large , with dynamic cell – cell adhesions , whereas Group D ( ACP5 , ARHGAP26 , IKBKE , PRKCE ) cells stretched as they moved slowly into the wound . Group E siRNA - transfected cells were morphologically indistinguishable from control cells . FES siRNA was unique , causing death of a significant number of cells by the end of the imaging . Loss of ACTB almost com - pletely impaired protrusion formation and cells moved forward very slowly with a smooth and united front . In general , we observed limited protrusion formation in cells trans - duced with siRNAs that impaired migration , suggesting that these genes affect cytoskeletal rearrangements involved in lamellae / lamel - lipodial dynamics . In contrast , a broad range of protrusive phenotypes was observed in the Accelerated migration bin . Knockdown of several genes ( PPP1R1B , STXYL1 , STK40 ) induced amoeboid - style migra - tion , with cells gliding over the surface , showing limited adhesive connections and small , transient protrusions . This phenotype may reflect a loss of cell – cell adhesion and reduction of cell – substratum adhesion . Collective migration following a leader cell was observed in both the Accelerated ( LTK , NEDD9 , FMN1 , MYLK , PTPRO , SRPK2 ) and Impaired ( ARHGAP26 , C9ORF98 , CDC2L1 , IKBKE , PRKCE , SGK3 , TLN1 , FLJ25006 ) migration bins ; cells oriented after wounding , then progressed into the cleared space behind a defined leader cell that dragged the monolayer in a triangular fashion . Towards closure , the leader cells regressed , or the trailing cells moved forward to form a more uniform edge . Effect of siRNAs on cell proliferation To evaluate whether the rate of wound healing was related to effects on cell proliferation , we monitored mitotic events using time - lapse images . There was no correlation between accelerated migration and increased cell proliferation and interestingly , several siRNAs suppressed prolifera - tion ( Supplementary Information , Table S3 ) . Many Impaired bin siRNAs decreased the number of mitoses ( Supplementary Information , Table S4 ) but there was no correlation between proliferation and migration dis - tance , suggesting that although reduced proliferation may contribute to the phenotype , other factors are also involved . Expression of cell adhesion proteins in the HC Accelerated bin . To investigate the biochemical basis for the variation in cell – cell adhe - sion , we analysed E - cadherin , P - cadherin and N - cadherin expression ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S6a ) .

A RT I C L E S CDH3 and PRKACA reduced cell – cell contact and total E - cadherin and P - cadherin expression . Interestingly , E - cadherin expression increased in some cell populations with weak cell – cell adhesions ( ADCK4 , CDC14C , CTNNB1 , CSNK1E , DOCK6 , GJA1 , PRKCH , STYXL1 ) and some that maintained contact ( ADAM17 , DUSP18 , LTK , FMN1 ) . Upregulation of N - cadherin , characteristic of an epithelial to mesenchymal transi - tion 17 , correlated with disruption of cell – cell adhesion ( ADCK4 , NEK8 , RIOK2 , RHOA , CDC14C ) , but not all , siRNAs ( ADCK1 , NEDD9 ) . Downregulation of N - cadherin expression was also observed for several genes that caused cell dissociation ( CTNND1 , GJA1 , STK40 ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S6a ) . Secondary SMART pool screen The Low Alamar phenotype could reflect a loss of monolayer integrity caused by loss of cell – cell or cell – substratum adhesion , suppression of cell proliferation , cell death or metabolic impairment . To address whether apoptosis is involved , we screened MCF - 10A cells overex - pressing the anti - apoptotic protein Bcl - 2 . The Low Alamar phenotype was rescued for only nine SMARTpools ( MSX1 , NCAM1 , RABGEF1 , SORBS1 , TGFB3 , NRCAM , PVR , PLAUR , MAPKAPK2 ; Supplementary Information , Table S2c ) . Of these , the first five impaired migration and the remainder had no effect . Therefore , apoptotic cell death is not the major cause for classification in this bin . ERBB2 has strong pro - survival activity and allows EGF - independent proliferation of MCF - 10A cells 18 , 19 . Overexpression of ERBB2 in MCF - 10A cells rescued the Low Alamar phenotype induced by the majority of the SMARTpools , including the nine genes rescued by Bcl - 2 ( 139 / 154 ; Supplementary Information , Table S2c ) . Seventeen SMARTpools accel - erated and 82 impaired migration , suggesting that ERBB2 overxpres - sion either unmasks migratory phenotypes obscured by toxic effects , or sensitizes MCF - 10A cells to loss - of - function effects that can enhance migration ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S7a ) . The Accelerated and Impaired bin siRNAs were also screened in MCF - 10A - ERBB2 cells ( Supplementary Information , Table S2a , b ) . From the Accelerated bin , 83 maintained the phenotype and 18 had no effect . From the Impaired bin , 32 impaired migration , 15 accelerated and nine were Low Alamar ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S7b ) . In summary , screens in ERBB2 - and Bcl - 2 - expressing cells revealed an additional 114 candidate hits that require further validation . DISCUSSION We undertook a systematic and stringent screening approach that identified 6 . 1 % of siRNAs as HC regulators of migration and 2 . 7 % that suppressed migration and lowered the cellular reducing potential . This proportion is higher than the hit - rate for a whole genome screen 20 , pos - sibly owing to the focused nature of our siRNA collection , and scoring multiple phenotypes . Forty - two HC genes have not been previously associated with specific ‘cell migration’ and ‘cell adhesion’ gene ontol - ogy ( GO ) terms ( Table 1 ) . Time - lapse microscopy highlighted the many phenotypes associated with the HC Accelerated and Impaired bins . Many knockdown cells showed transient and highly dynamic cell – cell adhesions , often involv - ing short - lived regions of contact , suggesting that these siRNAs may pre - vent maturation of stable cell – cell adhesions , potentially by alterations in adherens junction complexes or the linkage of junctional complexes to the cytoskeleton . Alternatively , alterations in cell – matrix adhesions that affect adherens junction dynamics may also weaken cell – cell adhe - sion 21 . Multiple siRNAs induced defects in cell polarity , causing either complete disruption ( protrusions in all directions ) or a bipolar pheno - type ( protrusions at opposing ends ) . Many siRNAs regulate the dynamics and morphology of protrusions . Although impaired motility was often associated with very small protrusions , this was not universally observed ( PTPN6 , RSU1 ) . Conversely , we only observed enlarged protrusions for the Accelerated Group D , which includes MYLK , a protein that regulates myosin contraction and has been implicated in regulation of protrusion dynamics . Knockdown of both myosin II isoforms in fibroblasts causes a significant expansion of protrusions , suggesting that the genes in this group may affect actin – myosin contraction 22 .

Impaired group D siRNAs showed compact monolayers at the initia - tion of wounding that stretched after minimal movement , possibly due to a lack of coupling between the forces at the front and rear of the cell . The formation of leader cells 23 – 26 , shown to involve RHOA regula - tion of the actin cytoskeleton 23 , suggests that the temporal and spatial regulation of RHOA – cytoskeletal signalling is unbalanced by those siRNAs . Knockdown of ACP5 , ARHGAP26 , CDC2L1 , DMPK , NEDD9 and VEGFC induced nuclear rotation , similar to that seen in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts exposed to mechanical shear stress 27 and Rat2 fibroblasts deficient in myosin IIB 22 . This may be mediated by nuclear lamin A / C through an inability to polarize the microtubule network 28 , suggesting a role for these genes in MTOC polarization . Most of the siRNAs affecting cell – cell adhesion , polarity , nuclear spinning and protrusion dynamics have no prior association with these processes . To identify pathways that link the HC genes and decipher the role of the 42 previously unknown migration genes , we used Ingenuity software . The top ranking network linked 28 of the 66 genes and centred around β - catenin , β1 - integrin and actin , all of which are known to regulate cell migration . Expansion of these nodes identified extensive networks ( Fig . 7a – c ) that are discussed in further detail ( Supplementary Information , Discussion ) . Many of the genes that interact with β - catenin accelerated migration and caused dissociation from the epithelial sheet , supporting a role for these genes in regulating cell – cell adhesion . The β1 - integrin network was enriched in genes that impaired migration , including a large number of focal adhesion a CDH2 ACTIN CTNNB1 ARHGEF18 VIL2 GJA1 CAMK2B ARPC2 ITK RDX SHC1 MARK4 ZBP1 FLNA WASL CFL1 PFN1 PARVA ITPKA TNS1 VIM NCAM1 ARPC1B RAC1 PFN2 TAF1 AKT1 c CTNNB1 CDH3 C T NN D 1 PKD2 CDH2 AKT1 RHOA CSNK1E EGFR RAC1 KDR FER SDCBP CSNK2A2 CSNK1D GJA1 PRKCE PRKCA PIK3CA PAK1 BRAF1 PLCG1 PLXNA1 VIL2 CBL PTK2B CIT FLNA ARHGEF18 ARHGEF11 PTPN6 VEGFC ZAP70 ACTG1 SYK BCR MAP3K11 PRKCZ PKD1 CTNNA1 ACTB N E K 8 PTPRO ITGB1 NEDD9 PARVA TLN1 VIM PIK3CA PRKACA PRKCA PTK2B ACTB ENAH PFN2 ARHGAP26 DDEF1 HRAS RHOA PARVG RAC1 CRK ARPC2 TNS1 AKT1 PTPN6 PTPRO PPFIA1 PTPRS BCAR3 SHC1 SDCBP PXN BCAR1 GRB7 LIMS1 CFL1 FLNA PLCG1 PKD1 CBL SYK PAK1 CORO1B VIL2 b MAPK1 Figure 7 Network relationships for the major signalling nodes β - catenin , β 1 - integrin and actin .

All rights reserved . A RT I C L E S proteins . Enrichment of actin - interactive proteins was expected , given their crucial role in regulation of the cytoskeleton . However , only MYLK and MYL5 scored a phenotype . The Low Alamar network revealed a strong bias towards the canonical EGFR / receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathway ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S7c ) . Cancer progression is associated with abrogation of normal controls that limit cell migration and invasion , eventually leading to metasta - sis . These changes typically involve enhanced migration , alteration in adhesion proteins and transient loss of cell – cell contact . We observed such phenotypes in the screen , raising the possibility that many genes may be associated with altered properties of cancer cells ( Supplementary Information , Discussion ) . For example , CSNK1E accelerates migration , induces cell dissociation and is expressed at low levels in poorly dif - ferentiated , higher - grade tumours 29 . RSU1 impaired migration and is selectively upregulated in basal high - grade breast tumours ( www . oncomine . org ) . This screen identified a large number of genes that positively or negatively regulate cell migration . Although elucidation of the regula - tory mechanisms requires additional studies , many of the siRNAs that enhanced cell migration disrupted cell – cell junctions . Focusing on these genes may provide new insights into processes that regulate cell – cell adhesion . Many HC genes have not been previously associated with cell migration and are suitable for analysis . Additional genes that regulate cell migration may be identified through further validation of the MC siRNAs ( 33 Accelerated , 50 Impaired and 29 Low Alamar ) . METHODS Screen design . A description of the screen design according to MIARE guidelines ( v . 0 . 6 . 5 ) can be found online ( www . cellmigration . org / pubs / wound _ rnai . htm ) . Cell culture , transfection and screening conditions . MCF - 10A parental cells and lines overexpressing ERBB2 and Bcl - 2 were cultured 30 ( http : / / brugge . med . har - vard . edu / protocols ) at a consistent density for a maximum of eight passages . Cells were plated at 8 . 1 × 10 3 per well in black - walled 96 - well plates ( Costar ) in antibiot - ic - free growth medium ( Invitrogen ) 16 h before transfection . Transfections were performed robotically using a CyBio CyBi - well robot with siRNAs ( final concen - tration 50 or 100 nM ) and DharmaFECT 3 transfection reagent ( 0 . 18 ml per well ; Thermofisher Scientific ) diluted in Optimem ( MediaTech ) . Transfections were performed in duplicate and quadruplicate if knockdown was evaluated . The effect of transfection on cell metabolism was measured by reduction of Alamar Blue dye ( Biosource ) , a membrane - permeable , non - toxic dye that fluo - resces when reduced , reflects cell viability , proliferation and metabolism 31 . The reagent was added 56 h after transfection , to a final concentration of 5 % , incu - bated for 1 h at 37 °C and quantified on a plate reader at 530 / 590 nm . Cells were wounded 58 h after transfection by generating a longitudinal scratch ( coefficient of variation 3 . 1 % ) using a robotically driven ( Seiko ) stainless - steel pin machined to deliver a scratch of 1 . 5 × 4 mm . After wounding , cells were washed once with growth medium and incubated for a further 12 h at 37 °C . Analysis of wound healing . Cells were fixed ( 2 % paraformaldehyde , 200 mM KCL , 20 mM Pipes pH 6 . 8 , 14 % sucrose , 4 mM MgCl 2 and 2 mM EGTA ) for 10 min then stained with rhodamine - conjugated phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) and DAPI in the presence of 0 . 2 % triton - X - 100 in Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) for 20 min . The wound was imaged as individual panels and these combined into a montage for visualization of the entire wound , using an Applied Precision CellWorx micro - scope with a fixed ×10 objective and 1 × 1 binning . Motility was quantified using a custom - designed MetaExpress ( Molecular Devices ) journal that used threshold analysis to determine the area remaining after closure . Individual panels were used for higher resolution image analysis by cropping a representative 5 - cm - square section from the wound edge followed by 50 % compression . Average area scores were calculated ( see below ) and a blinded visual analysis was performed by two independent investigators . Time - lapse video microscopy . Transfections were scaled to a 24 - well dish format at a final concentration of 50 nM . Cells were wounded 52 h after transfection and imaged using a ×20 ELWD objective on a Nikon TE2000E automated inverted microscope at 37 °C in the presence of C0 2 with the media blanketed by mineral oil ( Sigma ) to prevent evaporation . Imaging began 45 min after wounding and two fields were taken ( either side of the wound ) per well at 6 min intervals for 20 h . Migration patterns were followed for eight different cells for representative genes using the manual tool ‘track points’ in MetaMorph . The migration distance was calculated as the sum of the distance moved in each field . Persistence was calculated as a ratio of the net x - axis distance to the total distance moved . siRNA libraries . All siRNA reagents were obtained from Dharmacon ( www . thermo . com / Dharmacon ) based on gene annotation from 2004 . The complete list of genes , Entrez gene ID and catalogue number can be found in Supplementary Information , Tables S1a – c and online ( www . cellmigration . org / pubs / wound _ rnai . htm ) . A subset of genes was selected for off - target analysis using ON - TARGET plus SMARTpools . Focused studies on specific - hit genes were performed by select - ing and re - arraying the siRNA into 96 - well plates using a Tecan EVO75 Liquid Handler . Immunoblotting . Transfections were scaled to 6 - well dishes at a final con - centration of 50 nM . Cells were lysed by scraping into RIPA buffer 8 , proteins ( 20 mg of total lysate ) separated using the Novex precast gel system ( Invitrogen ) , transferred to PVDF membrane ( Immobilon ) , hybridized in 2 . 5 % milk in tris - buffered saline with Tween20 and detected with Pico chemiluminescence reagent ( Pierce ) . Primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1 : 1000 and secondary HRP - conjugated mouse or rabbit antibodies ( Jackson Laboratories ) at 1 : 5000 . E - cadherin ( 610182 ) , P - cadherin ( 610228 ) , N - cadherin ( 610921 ) and p120 - catenin ( 610134 ) were purchased from BD Bioscience Pharmingen . β - tubulin ( Ab6046 , Abcam ) , RHOA ( 26C4 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . shRNA infections . pLKO . 1puro - based lentiviral shRNA vectors 32 ( generously provided by The RNAi Consortium , Broad Institute , MA ) were used to downregu - late selected hit genes . MCF - 10A cells were infected and selected as described 33 . Data analysis and normalization . Data analysis was automated using a custom perl script , which parsed the MetaExpress ( wound healing area score ) and plate reader ( Alamar Blue data ) raw data files to generate an Excel spreadsheet with raw values , cal - culated values and hyperlinks to montaged wound images ( see below ) . PipelinePilot software ( Sci - tegic ) was used to manipulate Excel files and create subdatabases . The script calculated an area score for each siRNA reagent as follows : to cor - rect for plate - to - plate variability , the area value from each well was normalized to the trimmed mean ( 20 % ) of all area values from the plate , excluding positive controls . Fold change relative to the mock - transfected control was calculated by dividing the plate - normalized values by the median of all the normalized mock - transfected controls from all plates on the same screening day . Mean fold changes from replicates were calculated . During assay optimization , we found that Alamar Blue values showed posi - tional ‘edge’ effects , independent of the siRNA reagent . A correction factor was calculated for each plate by dividing the trimmed mean ( 20 % ) of the internal wells by the trimmed mean ( 20 % ) of the edge wells . Values from wells positioned at plate edges were multiplied by this correction factor , and plate normalization and fold changes were calculated as for the area score . For each gene , the perl script generated hyperlinks to image montages cre - ated using perlMagick ( ImageMagick , http : / / www . imagemagick . org / script / perl - magick . php ) . The montages contained all wound images for that gene , including replicates and different siRNA reagents , as well as the appropriate plate - specific mock - transfected controls . Statistical analysis of enrichment was performed using the binomial distribu - tion and simple interactive statistical analysis ( SISA , home . clara . net / sisa ) . Quantification of knockdown . The level of target gene knockdown was quanti - fied from duplicate plates using branched DNA ( bDNA , a nucleic acid hybridiza - tion method to directly quantify the amount of mRNA ) and the QuantiGene High Volume kit for the direct quantification of cellular mRNA ( Panomics ) using target specific probes . Values were normalized to an internal PP1B control , averaged and expressed relative to mock - transfection control levels . nature cell biology volume 10 | number 9 | SePTember 2008 1037 © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Protein interaction networks for the HC gene set were gener - ated using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis ( Ingenuity Systems , www . ingenuity . com ) . The focus genes were overlaid onto a global molecular network developed from direct interactions and sub - networks were algorithmically generated based on their connectivity . To further investigate the sub - networks , each node ( β - catenin , β1 - integrin , actin ) was entered into the program and all direct up and down - stream interactors were identified using the Grow Tool . Additional databases ( Bind , BioGRid , HPRD ) were also used . Analysis of hits using gene ontology terms . We searched three databases , the Biobase BioKnowledge Library ( BKL , http : / / www . biobase - international . com / pages / ) , David Bioinformatics Database ( http : / / david . abcc . ncifcrf . gov / summary . jsp ) , and GeneSifter ( http : / / www . genesifter . net / web / ) for functional annotation of hits using gene ontology , a controlled vocabulary of gene descriptors . Annotations were derived from these databases in June 2007 and restricted to those supported by experimental evidence .

A ) Wound healing assay reproducibility . To quantitate migration , the cells were fixed and labelled with rhodamine - conjugated phalloidin and imaged by automated fluorescent microscopy . Motility , termed the ‘area score’ was quantitated by measurement of the cleared area ( shown in red ) in a uniformly marked region ( demarcated by the green box ) using MetaExpress threshold analysis . After normalisation , the mock transfection control was set at 1 . Knockdown of RHOA accelerates motility with an area score of 0 . 41 . Knockdown of RAC1 impedes migration , resulting in an open wound area and score of 3 . 5 . The Z’ factor , a statistical measurement of the robustness and reproducibility of the motility scores were 0 . 29 and 0 . 41 respectively . SMARTpool reproducibility was 88 % between duplicate plates from the same day and 83 . 7 % of SMARTpools showed the same phenotype across all experiments . B ) Knockdown of PP1B was > 80 % relative to the mock - transfected control for each of four different SMARTpools ( SP1 - 4 ) , analysed on three independent days in triplicate . Shown as the average + / - SD . C ) Hits were classified based on the SMARTpool screens , which were subsequently validated by screening with individual siRNA sequences . Each siRNA was assayed in duplicate with multiple biological replicates . Concentrating on the Accelerated and Impaired hit bins , higher resolution analysis of the cellular morphology and time - lapse imaging were performed .

B ) Breakdown of the proportion of SMARTpools in the phosphatase , kinase and MAR libraries ( expected ) compared to the actual proportion observed . ‘All hit bins’ represent the merge of the Accelerated , Impaired and Low Alamar bins and is compared with the breakdown for each individual bin . These data show the phosphatases were under - represented as a group ( p = 9 . 28x10 - 6 ) when comparing all hits and that the Low Alamar bin contributed significantly to the under - representation . Similarly the kinases were over - represented in the Impaired bin . C ) Of the 762 genes analysed for knockdown ( kinases and phosphatases ) , 42 % of siRNAs targeted greater than 70 % . 28 % of the library ( 217 genes ) was not analysed due to technical reasons . The extent of knockdown for each gene is indicated online , www . cellmigration . org . A high proportion ( 43 . 7 % ) of the phosphatase genes were not detectable in the bDNA assay . One possible explanation for the proportionately higher number of No Change phenotypes in the phosphatase library may be that a number of genes are very poorly , or not expressed in the MCF - 10A cell line .

Supplementary Discussion Results Validation of selected genes using an shRNA approach Eleven genes that accelerated migration were randomly chosen for further validation by stable knockdown using lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs . We evaluated four or five shRNAs for each gene under standard assay conditions and detected accelerated migration for one or more shRNAs targeting ADCK4 ( HC ) , CTNNB1 ( HC ) , CTNND1 ( HC ) , ENPP1 ( Discordant ) , GJA1 ( HC ) , MAPK14 ( Discordant ) , NCK1 ( MC ) , NEK8 ( HC ) , PPM1D ( Discordant ) , PTPRO ( HC ) and RHOA ( HC ) . The remaining sequences showed No Change . From these analyses we gained more confidence that some of the Discordant genes could be reassigned with further analysis . While we have not validated mRNA or protein knockdown for all of these hairpins , identifying similar phenotypes using alternative reagents provides further validation for the screen and the specific genes analysed . Stable knockdown vectors encoding shRNAs will be very useful for mechanistic studies requiring longer - term assays . Discussion Using Gene Ontology ( GO ) annotation , 212 of the 1081 genes screened ( 19 . 6 % ) have been previously linked to cell migration or adhesion in any cell type or assay using traditional hypothesis - driven , non - high - throughput methods . We identified 46 of these genes as High or Moderate confidence regulators of migration ( Table1 ; Supplementary Table 2A , B , C ) . Only the Accelerated and Impaired HC bins were enriched in known migration or adhesion genes ; 2 . 2 - fold in the Accelerated set ( p = 0 . 029 ) and 2 . 8 - fold in the Impaired set ( p = 0 . 012 ) . Forty - two HC genes ( 22 Accelerated and 20 Impaired ) have no prior association with cell migration or adhesion using these GO terms as specific criteria ( Table 1 ) . Twelve of these have no experimentally supported GO annotation ( ADCK1 , ADCK4 , CDC14C , CDC2L5 , CSNK2A2 , C9orf98 , DOCK6 , ENPP5 , FLJ25006 , LOC390975 , NEK8 , RIOK2 ) , while the remaining 30 have been characterised to various extents , with 17 involved in major cellular processes , including ‘cell death’ , ‘cell proliferation’ , ‘cell cycle’ and ‘cell differentiation’ . Many of these are likely to be involved in central pathways that can impinge on multiple processes including cell migration . To further investigate the three major signalling nodes , β - catenin , β 1 - integrin and actin , each node was entered separately into the Ingenuity Network Explorer and all direct , up - and down - stream interactors were identified . These gene lists were then cross - referenced against the HC gene list ; then , to gain more pathway information we included the MC Accelerated and Impaired genes and those that reverted the Low Alamar or Impaired phenotypes in the ERBB2 background . We interrogated several protein interaction databases ( Bind , BioGrid , HPRD , Ingenuity and the Adhesome 1 ) and identified extended network linkages ( Figure 7A , B and C ) that are discussed in detail below . The β - catenin network . β - catenin ( CTNNB1 ) regulates cell adhesion through its interaction with classic cadherins and other junctional proteins , but also mediates pleiotrophic changes in cell behaviour through its activity as a nuclear transcriptional regulator 2 . siRNAs targeting most of the HC hit genes that directly interact with β - catenin ( CDH3 , CSNK1E , GJA1 , CTNNB1 , CTNND1 ) accelerated migration and caused dissociation of cells from the epithelial sheet , supporting a role for these genes in regulating cell - cell adhesion in MCF - 10A cells ( Figure 7A ) . Interestingly , HC Impaired genes PTPN6 and CSNK2A2 also interact directly with β - catenin and showed altered cell - cell adhesion and erratic migratory behaviour © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . despite impairing migration . Of the Accelerated Group D siRNAs that showed weak cell - cell adhesion by time - lapse imaging , only PTPRO has been linked to β - catenin signalling . This phenotype is consistent with the ability of PTPRO to reverse EGF - and v - src induced tyrosine phosphorylation of β - catenin and suppress migration of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells 3 . By static imaging , α - catenin ( CTNNA1 ; MC Accelerated ) showed some loss of cell - cell adhesion primarily at the wound edge . Cadherin family receptors are the major cellular mediators of cell - cell adhesion . Of the classic cadherins , MCF - 10A cells express E - cadherin and P - cadherin and variable levels of N - cadherin , depending on cell density . P - cadherin is typically associated with basal cells of epidermal derived tissues 4 and MCF - 10A cells display an expression signature typical of basal cells 5 . It is noteworthy that the only cadherin family gene implicated in migration in this screen was CDH3 ( P - cadherin ) ; down - regulation of E - cadherin scored as No Phenotype and N - cadherin as Discordant ( from original Impaired bin ) . Knockdown of E - cadherin mRNA was not analysed , but the SMARTpool and two individual sequences did not target effectively ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S6B ) . Down - regulation of P - cadherin protein and mRNA was very efficient ( Figure 2 ) and was associated with a striking disruption of cell adhesion and acceleration of migration ; interestingly , the P - cadherin SMARTpool siRNA reagent decreased expression of E - cadherin ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S6A , C ) . These results provide explanations for the dramatic disruption of cell - cell adhesion by P - cadherin knockdown and the lack of effect of E - cadherin siRNAs . CSNK1E has been shown to regulate β - catenin ( Figure 7A ) 6 and to inhibit cell - cell adhesion through phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of E - cadherin 7 . Knockdown of CSNK1E and CSNK1G2 resulted in a HC Accelerated migration phenotype coupled with minimal cell - cell adhesion and rapid and erratic migration . SMARTpool siRNA reagents targeting six of the seven other casein kinase family members Impaired migration , with CSNK2A2 validating with HC and interacting directly with β - catenin . Both CSNK1D and CSNK1G1 scored Impaired when screened in ERBB2 cells and on this basis , CSNK1D is also implicated in β - catenin signalling ( Figure 7A ) . Dichotomous roles for casein kinase 1 isoforms have been previously described , e . g . in the canonical Wnt pathway , where CSNK1A is a negative regulator , whereas CSNK1G3 , CSNK1D and CSNK1E positively regulate this pathway 8 . Connexin 43 ( GJA1 ) , a down - stream effector of β - catenin 9 is an intercellular junction protein and tumour suppressor gene , that is often down - regulated in breast cancer . Over - expression dramatically reduces the invasiveness of some tumour cell lines 10 and down - regulation at wound sites has been shown to enhance migration , supporting the relevance of our findings 11 . Video microscopy revealed that reduced expression significantly impairs cell - cell contact and causes erratic migration . Large , broad protrusions and long retraction tails suggest abrogation of myosin signalling . Further studies are required to identify the mechanism of adhesion disruption . PTPN6 is also involved in β 1 - integrin signalling , and while predominant in hematopoietic cells , it appears to play multiple roles in various human epithelial cancers 12 . Consistent with its importance in cell - cell and cell - substratum adhesion , loss of this gene resulted in loss of cell - cell contact within the monolayer and an almost complete inability to migrate . It is possible that lack of substratum adhesion impedes the ability of the cells at the leading edge of the wound to make adhesive contacts sufficient for motility . PKD2 , a downstream target of β - catenin has been shown to regulate branching morphogenesis of the developing kidney 13 and associates with NEK8 , a HC Accelerated gene , that has been shown to regulate cell - cell adhesion in association with PKD2 14 . Consistent with this data , knockdown of NEK8 causes a significant reduction in cell - cell contact . © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . The strong correlation between MCF - 10A cell motility and weak cell - cell adhesion is not surprising 15 , 16 , however , this is the first systematic study that demonstrates a strong correlation between weakened adhesion and enhanced motility . The time - lapse video microscopy data suggests the enhanced migration is at least in part a consequence of release of constraints imposed by cell - cell junctional interactions in the epithelial sheet ; however , the alterations in adherens junctions could affect motility more directly by altering the localisation , interactions and dosage of signalling and cytoskeletal proteins that affect cell motility . Alternatively , the loss of adhesion could be a secondary consequence of cytoskeletal alterations more directly responsible for enhanced motility . Interestingly , the majority of the genes that accelerated migration and caused some degree of cell dissociation have not been implicated in cell - cell adhesion and weren’t linked in the network with known junctional proteins ( ADCK4 , CDC14C , CSNK1G2 , DDEF1 , DOCK6 , PFN2 , PPP1R1B , PRKCH , STK40 , STXYL1 , TPD52L3 ) . Of these genes only DDEF1 has been implicated in the regulation of cell migration 17 . The β 1 - integrin network . To fully interrogate the β 1 - integrin network , we created a Focal Adhesion gene set by combining the Adhesome protein database 1 , Focal Adhesion GO and literature annotation ( Figure 7B ; Table S5 ) and found that the HC Impaired genes contributed significantly to this network ( p = 0 . 001 ) . This network has been drawn to highlight the major interacting groups , including GTPases and GTPase regulators , adaptors , actin regulators and a number of kinases and phosphatases . From the Focal Adhesion gene set , seven of nine genes from the Impaired bin and four of five genes from the Accelerated bin have been implicated in migration . ARHGAP26 ( GRAF ) , PTPN6 and PTPRO have not been strictly linked to migration . ARHGAP26 is a GTPase activating protein for RHOA that associates with Focal Adhesion Kinase ( FAK ) 18 and when over - expressed decreased Rho - activation and suppressed stressed fibers 19 , suggesting that it could be involved in dynamic aspects of focal adhesion formation critical for cell migration . PTPRO has previously been linked to axon outgrowth and negatively regulates ephrin receptors , which regulate migration in multiple cell types . Down - regulation of one Ephrin family member , EPHB2 20 , also impaired migration with HC . Multiple focal adhesion - associated proteins scored with MC as well : the Accelerated bin includes ENAH ( MENA ) , NCK1 , PARVA ( Parvin ) , PRKCA ( PKC α ) , SLK and N - WASP ( WASL ) ; the Impaired bin includes PARVG ( Parvin ) , RAC1 and TNS1 ( tensin ) . Many other focal adhesion proteins that inhibited migration induced a Low Alamar phenotype ( BCAR3 , GRB7 , NCK2 , PXN ( paxillin ) , SVIL and TLN2 ; Supplementary Information , Table S5 ) . All except TLN2 were rescued and impaired migration when re - screened in the ERBB2 background , thus implicating them in migration as well . The majority of these genes are linked in the β 1 - integrin pathway ( Figure 7B ) . The finding that many integrin - linked and focal adhesion proteins affect cell migration is not surprising given the important role of matrix adhesion in this process and the identification of these genes in this screen provide further validation of the screen . MCF - 10A cells express multiple integrins and secrete several matrix proteins ( e . g . collagens and laminins ) that serve as ligands for β 1 integrins . A large number of the integrin family members were screened , yet knockdown of only β 1 caused a dramatic phenotype . siRNAs targeting integrins α 6 and β 4 , receptors for laminin , showed no effect . This may reflect the dominance of β 1 in adhesive interactions critical to migration in a wound healing format or the possible failure of other integrin siRNAs to knockdown effectively . The Actin network . © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . Enrichment of actin interactive proteins in the HC data set was expected given their critical role in regulation of the cytoskeleton and cell motility . We observed a similar number of HC Impaired and Accelerated genes that interact directly with Actin ( Figure 7C ) . It is interesting that PFN2 siRNAs accelerated migration since the related isoform PFN1 impaired migration and both play a critical role in actin polymerisation through catalysis of ATP exchange on actin monomers , promoting their addition to filament barbed ends . Nine of the 12 genes identified in the network after screening in the ERBB2 background impaired migration ( ARPC1B , ARHGEF18 , CDH2 , FLNA , NCAM1 , PFN1 , RDX , SHC1 , ZBP1 ) . Fourteen myosin or myosin - regulatory proteins were screened , and perhaps surprisingly , only two scored a phenotype ; the myosin regulatory kinase , MYLK scored HC Accelerated and MYL5 scored MC Low Alamar which was rescued by ERBB2 expression . Of the actin nucleator ARP family members , ARPC2 and ARPC5 both scored MC Impaired and had no phenotype in ERBB2 cells , ARPC1B scored MC Low Alamar which was rescued by ERBB2 and the remainder ARPC1A , ARPC3 , ARPC4 and ACTR3 all scored Discordant phenotypes from the original No Change bin . RHO family Knockdown of RHOA accelerated migration ; however , we did not observe any significant enrichment in either the HC or MC hit lists for any of the 10 other RHO GTPases family members that were assayed . The majority of exchange factors showed Discordant phenotypes that originated from the No Change bin . Knockdown of RAC1 , required for lamellipodial dynamics in many cell types 21 scored MC Impaired , while CDC42 , a protein that regulates motility polarity and directionality 21 , scored a Discordant No Change , suggesting it is either not important for polarity or directionality in MCF - 10A cells or these siRNAs target the gene inefficiently . Low Alamar and EGFR signalling Pathway analysis of the Low Alamar MC and ERBB2 bin genes revealed a strong bias around the canonical EGFR / receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathway ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S7C ) . While EGF activates pathways that suppress apoptosis , the failure of BCL2 to rescue most of the Low Alamar siRNAs suggests that the Low Alamar score does not primarily reflect apoptotic cell death . Because MCF - 10A cells require EGF for proliferation , the reduced Alamar Blue score could in part be due to suppression of proliferation . However , other studies in our lab have shown that withdrawal of EGF dramatically decreases Alamar Blue reduction independent of proliferative and anti - apoptotic effects ( Z . Schafer and J . S . B . data not shown ) . This raises the possibility that EGF regulates metabolic activity in MCF - 10A cells . Indeed , knockdown of EGFR in MCF - 10A cells resulted in a MC Low Alamar phenotype that was rescued by ERBB2 . Several Low Alamar bin genes , including IRS2 , RAS , PI3K , AKT1 , and FRAP1 ( mTOR ) have all been implicated in regulating intracellular nutrient uptake and / or energy balance 22 - 24 . It is likely that the ability of ERBB2 over - expression to rescue the Low Alamar phenotype in the vast majority of cells is due to rescue of both proliferative and metabolic impairments . Given the importance of the EGFR pathway in this phenotype and the fact that our screen identified major components of this pathway , it is intriguing to speculate that further study of some of the poorly characterised Low Alamar genes may identify new genes that regulate cellular energy homeostasis . While some of the siRNAs targeting cell adhesion proteins like BCAR3 , ELMO3 and TPM1 may cause a Low Alamar score by inducing cell detachment , there was no enrichment for adhesion GO categories in the Low Alamar MC gene set , so it is either unlikely that loss of adhesion represents the major cause of the Low Alamar phenotype or that we have identified new adhesion - related genes that require further investigation . © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Cancer associated implications from the screen Cancer progression is associated with abrogation of normal controls that limit cell migration and invasion , eventually leading to metastasis , the major cause of morbidity associated with tumourigenesis . Cells must adopt new characteristics to carry out cellular processes associated with invasion and metastasis and invasiveness is typically associated with enhanced migration , alterations in adhesion proteins , and loss of cell - cell contact . Many of the siRNAs analysed in this screen induced such properties in MCF - 10A cells raising the possibility that the reductions in the levels of these genes may be associated with migratory phenotypes of cancer cells . In addition , siRNAs that suppressed migration could target proteins that drive migration of tumour cells . The most obvious candidate genes that could contribute to invasion / metastasis would be those genes whose reduction by siRNA cause cell - cell dissociation , a property associated with tumour cell dissemination . The majority of the HC and MC Accelerated bin siRNAs induced cell dissociation and altered the expression or localisation of E - cadherin . Suppression or relocalisation of E - cadherin is associated with tumour initiation and progression in several epithelial cancers 25 . For example , reduced expression and aberrant localisation of the HC Accelerated gene CTNND1 are among the most common events associated with many epithelial tumours 26 , 27 . CSNK1E , a Accelerated bin gene that caused reduced cell - cell adhesion when down - regulated , is expressed at low levels in poorly differentiated , higher grade tumours and there is a positive association between loss of heterozygosity and somatic mutations in CSNK1E in breast tumours 28 . NF - 1 , another Accelerated bin gene , is a well characterised tumour suppressor , acting at the level of RAS suppression 29 . PTPRO has been implicated in tumour suppression in human lung , liver and colon cancer based on methylation studies and loss of expression observed in the majority of primary liver and lung tumours 30 . In vitro over - expression studies suggest a role for PTPRO in regulating anchorage independent proliferation and survival ; however , our studies suggest that loss of this phosphatase might enhance migratory activity of tumour cells . NEK8 induced cell dissociation and increased motility and while largely unstudied , a recent report suggests it is associated with breast tumourigenesis , with increased expression in tumour tissue compared with normal breast 31 . A number of other genes identified in this screen have been implicated in cancer due to their gain of expression in tumours . From the HC Impaired bin , the best characterised gene associated with cancer is Akt which is frequently activated in tumour cells due to hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway resulting from mutations in PIK3CA , its 85 kDA regulatory subunit or loss of the PIP3 negative regulator PTEN ; however , it is also amplified or mutated in some tumours 32 . A distinct regulatory subunit of PI3K , PIK3R5 , scored as a HC Impaired bin hit ; however this particular subunit has not been implicated in cancer . IKBKE , which regulates NFKB , is amplified in breast tumours 33 and other hit genes including DUSP6 34 , RSU1 ( www . oncomine . org ) , EPHB2 35 , NRP1 36 and ARHGAP26 37 are frequently up - regulated in tumours . RSU1 is particularly interesting with respect to basal , high grade breast tumours where it is selectively and significantly up - regulated in this subtype of breast tumours ( www . oncomine . org ) . Closer inspection of the role of these genes in tumour cell migration and cancer is warranted based on our studies . References 1 .
