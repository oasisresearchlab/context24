In the United States , children represent 22 % of the population but only 1 . 7 % of confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 cases 1 . One possibility is that symptom - based viral testing is less likely to identify infected children , since they often experience milder disease than adults 1 , 4 – 7 . To better assess the frequency of pediatric SARS - CoV - 2 infection , we serologically screened 1 , 775 residual samples from Seattle Children’s Hospital collected from 1 , 076 children seeking medical care during March and April of 2020 . Only one child was seropositive in March , but nine were seropositive in April for a period seroprevalence of > 1 % . Most seropositive children ( 8 / 10 ) were not suspected of having had COVID - 19 . The sera of most seropositive children had neutralizing activity , including one that neutralized at a dilution > 1 : 18 , 000 . Therefore , among children seeking medical care , the frequency of SARS - CoV - 2 infection increased markedly during the early Seattle outbreak despite few positive viral tests . One of the first cases of community transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in the United States was identified in the greater Seattle area in late February , 2020 8 , 9 . By late March , thousands of cases had been identified in Washington state by viral RT - PCR testing , mostly among adults ( https : / / www . doh . wa . gov / Emergencies / Coronavirus ) . Schools closed statewide on March 17 , and a statewide stay - at - home order was issued the next week . March and April of 2020 are therefore critical months for understanding the early dynamics of the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic in the Seattle area . Because SARS - CoV - 2 - infected children often experience little or no disease 1 , 4 – 6 , we sought to identify infections using an approach independent of symptom - based viral testing . .

When interpreting these assays in a temporal context , note that individuals do not become seropositive until » 1 to 2 weeks post symptom onset 10 – 14 . We serologically screened 1 , 775 residual serum samples from Seattle Children’s Hospital that were collected between March 3 and April 24 , 2020 following approval from the Human Subjects Institutional Review Board . These samples were collected from 1 , 076 unique children who visited the hospital and received blood draws for any reason , including respiratory illnesses , surgery , or ongoing medical care . Demographics and reason for medical admission are presented below with results of our serological testing . The generalizability of this study population to all children in Seattle is unknown , particularly because hospital visitors were primarily those with urgent medical needs during the statewide stay - at - home order . We used a multi - assay serological testing approach based on an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) protocol that recently received emergency use authorization from New York State and the FDA 15 , 16 , although we added an additional validation assay to increase stringency . Furthermore , as described below , we confirmed that most seropositive samples had activity in pseudovirus neutralization assays . We first screened all sera at a 1 : 50 dilution for IgG binding to the SARS - CoV - 2 spike receptor binding domain ( RBD ) and compared results to a negative control consisting of a pool of sera collected in 2017 and 2018 ( Figure 1a ) . We identified 102 of 1 , 775 samples with readings that exceeded the average of the negative controls by > 5 standard deviations . These preliminary hits were further assessed with IgG ELISAs using serial dilutions of sera against two antigens : RBD and pre - fusion stabilized spike ectodomain trimer ( Figure 1b ) . As negative controls , we included twelve serum samples and two serum pools collected before 2020 ; we also tested some pediatric samples that were negative in the initial RBD screen . We summarized the ELISAs by calculating the area under the curve ( AUC ) , and called samples as seropositive if the AUC exceeded the average of the negative controls by > 5 standard deviations for both RBD and spike ( Figure 1c ) . The AUCs for RBD and spike ELISAs were highly correlated ( Figure 1d ) , but some sera exhibited slightly higher reactivity to one antigen than the other , meaning that screening on both antigens introduces additional stringency . .

( a ) We screened 1 , 775 child samples by ELISA to RBD at a single dilution in four batches , with CR3022 antibody 17 , 18 as a positive control and pre - 2020 sera as a negative control . Samples with OD450 readings that exceeded pre - 2020 sera by > 5 standard deviations ( dotted blue line ) were considered potential hits . ( b ) All potential hits from the initial screen as well as some screen - negative samples and additional controls were tested at serial dilutions for binding to RBD ( top ) or full spike ( bottom ) . Samples from adults or children with RT - PCR - confirmed infections are labeled by weeks post symptom onset ; all remaining samples from children with no positive RT - PCR test are in the rightmost facet .

Neither adult nor child samples < 1 week post symptom onset were seropositive by our criteria , consistent with prior reports on kinetics of the antibody response to SARS - CoV - 2 10 – 14 . However , all samples ³ 1 week post symptom onset were seropositive , and in most cases the signal greatly exceeded pre - 2020 negative controls . Samples from children who never tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 are shown at far right in Figure 1b , c . The samples in this set that we classified as seropositive had readings comparable to confirmed infections ³ 1 week post symptom onset . However , some samples from children who had not tested positive for virus had readings that exceeded pre - 2020 negative controls but were weaker than confirmed - infection samples ³ 1 week post symptom onset . Our stringent criteria classify these samples as seronegative , although it is possible that some represent recent infections in children who had not yet developed robust antibody responses . Indeed , one symptomatic child who tested positive by RT - PCR had multiple samples taken < 1 week post symptom onset that were seronegative ( Figure 1b , “child < 1 wk” ) . However , in light of concerns about the poor specificity of some serological assays 19 – 21 , we chose to conservatively call only strongly seropositive samples at the potential cost of missing some recent infections . Overall , our assays identified 12 seropositive samples from 10 different children in the study population . These include 9 seropositive samples from 8 children who had never tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 ( far right facet of Figure 1b , c ) , as well as the samples from the children labeled as 2 and 3 weeks post symptom onset in Figure 1b , c . The seropositive samples from the children 1 and 4 weeks post symptom onset are from RT - PCR - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infections that were referred to Seattle Children’s Hospital , and are not part of the residual serum pool that makes up our study population ( see Methods for details ) .

The first seropositive sample was collected in late March , and there were no additional seropositive samples until the second week of April . From that time on , a low but steady fraction of samples were seropositive for a period seroprevalence slightly greater than 1 % in April ( Figure 2a , b ) . Notably , our period seroprevalence measurements for children seeking medical care are similar to all - age cumulative incidence estimates for the Seattle region based on viral testing and mortality data 22 , 23 given the » 1 to 2 week lag between symptom onset and seroconversion 10 – 14 . We also examined how many seropositive children had received RT - PCR viral tests for COVID - 19 . This is an important question , since children are under - represented in viral - testing case counts 1 – 3 and household - contact studies differ regarding whether secondary attack rates are lower in children than adults 24 , 25 . Over a third of children in our study had received at least one viral test ( Table 1 ; note that administration of a viral test does not imply a child was suspected of having COVID - 19 , since tests were routinely administered before hospital admission or procedures such as surgery ) . Of the 10 seropositive children , only 2 had tested positive for virus ( Table 1 , Supplementary Table 1 ) . Three other seropositive children had tested negative for virus in routine screening prior to surgery . The remaining seropositive children never received a viral test . Additionally , 1 child with a positive viral test was seronegative ; this is the child whose serum was collected < 1 week post symptom onset ( Figure 2b , c ) , prior to when seroconversion is expected to occur . A detailed chart review revealed that only the two seropositive children with a RT - PCR confirmed viral infection had documented COVID - 19 symptoms ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . One additional seropositive child , who presented at the hospital for an allergic reaction , had previous household exposure to the virus but had not been tested because she did not develop symptoms . The seven other seropositive children were at the hospital for reasons unrelated to respiratory illness and had no documented exposures ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Other demographic and clinical data had no noteworthy associations with seropositivity . Seropositive children were about equally likely to be male or female ( Table 1 ) , agreeing with Table 1 : Cohort demographics . If a child had multiple samples , age and admit were determined based on the child’s first visit . For viral testing status , a child was classified as positive if they had a positive viral test at any visit . All Children ( n = 1076 ) Seropositive Children ( n = 10 ) 0 to 4 192 4 5 to 9 214 1 10 to 14 301 2 ≥15 369 3 F 535 4 M 541 6 Positive 3 2 Negative 389 3 Not tested 684 5 Outpatient 653 4 Inpatient 306 4 Emergency 101 2 Day surgery 16 0 Age ( years ) Sex RT - PCR viral testing status Admit type .

The seropositive children spanned all ages from 0 - 4 years to ³ 15 years and were admitted to the hospital for a variety of reasons ( Table 1 , Supplementary Table 1 ) . Finally , we measured the neutralizing activity of sera from seropositive children using lentiviral particles pseudotyped with spike 27 . Eight of 10 seropositive children neutralized virus at a > 1 : 25 dilution ( Figure 3 , Supplementary Figure 1 ) , with neutralization correlating with RBD and spike binding as measured in the ELISAs ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . This frequency of neutralizing activity is consistent with reports that 80 - 90 % of recovered adults have neutralizing activity 10 , 28 , 29 , as well as our measurements for 7 adults at 3 to 8 weeks post symptom onset ( Figure 3 ) . Note that the two children without neutralizing activity had not experienced symptoms , so it is possible that the sera was collected before neutralizing activity is expected to appear 10 . Two children had very high neutralizing activity , including one with a potency that exceeded the limit of our assay ( > 1 : 18 , 000 dilution ) . In comparison , the aggregated results of four studies of adults reported only 2 out of 263 individuals who had neutralizing activity > 1 : 10 , 000 at 2 to 5 weeks post symptom onset using lentiviral pseudotype assays similar to our own 10 , 28 – 30 . Our sample size is too small to draw conclusions about neutralizing immunity in children versus adults , but this is an interesting area for further study given that children develop stronger or quicker neutralizing responses to some other viruses 31 – 35 . In this study , we used serological assays to retrospectively identify SARS - CoV - 2 infections in children early in the Seattle outbreak . Although our study used sera collected from children seeking medical care and therefore does not represent an unbiased population survey , it nonetheless represents the first large - scale SARS - CoV - 2 serological survey of children . In particular , seropositivity increased markedly from March to April of 2020 , and most seropositive children had never tested positive for virus . However , the overall frequency of seropositivity was low ( » 1 % ) even in April , suggesting that while infections of children are often missed by viral testing perhaps due to the lack of symptoms , only a small fraction of children in Seattle had been infected by SARS - CoV - 2 as of April 2020 .

Dashed blue lines are the limits of the dilution series ; points at those limits represent lower or upper bounds on the IC50 .

Adequate volume of sera remaining after other lab tests were conducted was the main sample - selection criterion , which inherently reduces the relative number of samples from infants who have smaller blood - draw volumes . Adult samples ( Figure 1b , c ) were residual plasma collected from RT - PCR confirmed infections from the Seattle area at the University of Washington , or from COVID - 19 - positive individuals enrolled in a prospective cohort study . The sample collection and this study were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Seattle Children’s Hospital and the University of Washington . Additional RT - PCR - confirmed COVID - 19 pediatric cases were actively recruited to enroll in another approved study at Seattle Children’s Hospital during this study period . These actively enrolled children were omitted from this seroprevalence study , which consisted of the residual serum sample pool at Seattle Children’s Hospital and its clinics . However , pediatric samples from 1 and 4 week ( s ) post symptom onset facets in Figure 1b , c and Figure 3 are from these actively enrolled children and were included in these plots to illustrate the sensitivity of our serological assays—however , these two children are not included in estimates of seroprevalence Figure 2 or Table 1 . Additionally , in Figure 1b , c , samples in the < 1 week facet ( two samples from same individual ) , the 2 week facet ( two samples from another individual ) , and the 3 week facet ( single sample another individual ) were RT - PCR - confirmed cases that were not recruited to Seattle Children’s Hospital and so are included in the seroprevalence estimates . Serological assays We initially screened all sera at a 1 : 50 serum dilution for IgG binding to RBD . All sera were heat - inactivated at 56 ° C for 1 hour . Ninety - six well Immunlon 2HB plates ( Thermo Fisher ; 3455 ) were coated with 2 µg / mL of His - tagged RBD in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) overnight at 4 ° C . The RBD antigen was produced in mammalian cells and purified as previously described 15 , 16 , 36 . The next day , plates were washed 3 times with PBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ( PBS - T ) using an automated plate washer ( Tecan HydroFlex ) and blocked for 1 - 2 hours at room temperature with PBS - T containing 3 % non - fat dry milk . Sera were diluted 1 : 50 in PBS - T containing 1 % non - fat dry milk . Block was thrown off , and 100 µL of diluted sera was transferred to the ELISA plate in a setup as previously described 16 . Each plate also contained two positive control wells ( CR3022 17 , 18 , an anti - SARS - CoV - 1 monoclonal antibody that reacts to the SARS - CoV - 2 RBD , at 0 . 5 µg / mL ) and two negative control wells ( pooled human sera taken from 2017 - 2018 ( Gemini Biosciences , 100 - 110 , lot H86W03J ) . CR3022 was expressed in Expi293F cells and purified by protein A and size exclusion chromatography using established methods . After a two - hour incubation at room temperature , plates were washed with PBS - T thrice . Goat anti - human IgG - Fc horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated antibody ( Bethyl Labs , A80 - 104P ) was diluted 1 : 3 , 000 in PBS - T containing 1 % milk and 50 µL was added to each well . After 1 hour at room temperature , plates were washed thrice with PBS - T , and 100 µL of TMB / E HRP substrate ( Millipore Sigma ; ES001 ) was added to each well . After 5 minutes , 100 µL 1N HCl was added , and OD450 was read immediately on a Tecan infinite M1000Pro plate reader . Samples were considered potential positive hits in the screen if their reading exceeded the average of all of the 2017 - 2018 negative control readings by > 5 standard deviations , computing this threshold separately for each screening batch ( Figure 1a ) . Follow - up ELISAs were performed on all potential positive hits from the screening assay , plus a subset of samples that were negative in the initial screen ( all samples that proved seropositive by our .

These follow - up ELISAs were performed as for the screening step described above , with the following differences : All sera were run at five 3 - fold dilutions , starting at 1 : 25 . Each plate contained a negative control dilution series ( pooled human sera taken from 2017 - 2018 ) , and a CR3022 positive control dilution series starting at a concentration of 1 ug / mL . Trimeric , prefusion - stabilized spike was produced as previously described 36 with the following minor changes : the protein was produced using expiHEK293F cells transfected transiently with PEI , and the cultures were grown at 33 ° C for 3 days prior to downstream talon batch purification . The additional control samples tested during follow up ELISAs were pooled human sera from 2008 - 2015 ( Gemini Biosciences , 100 - 110 , lot H87W00K ) , and 12 de - identified banked serum samples collected between 1986 and 1992 ( Bloodworks Northwest ) . AUC analysis For the follow - up ELISAs performed at serial dilutions , the AUC represents the area under the titration curve after putting the serial dilutions on a log - scale ( as plotted in Figure 1b ) . Readings for the 2017 - 2018 pooled sera that was run on each plate were first averaged and treated as a single sample . This , along with the 12 banked pre - 2020 sera samples and the additional 2008 - 2015 pooled sera were treated as 14 negative controls and used to determine a cutoff in each assay ( average of all negative controls plus five standard deviations ) . Neutralization assays SARS - CoV - 2 spike - pseudotyped lentivirus neutralization assays were performed as previously described 27 , with the following slight modifications . Infections were carried out in poly - L - lysine ( P4707 , Millipore Sigma , Burlington , MA , USA ) coated black - walled , clear - bottom plates ( 655090 , Greiner Bio - One , Kremsmünster , Austria ) and luciferase activity was measured in these plates without transferring to opaque bottom plates . Sera were diluted 3 - fold seven times starting at a 1 : 25 dilution and luciferase activity was measured at 52 hours post - infection . Target cells were HEK - 293T cells transduced to express hACE2 27 ( BEI Resources , NR - 52511 ) . Samples were run in duplicate and each plate included two no - serum controls . Fraction infectivity was calculated by normalizing the luciferase reading for each sample by the average of the two no - serum control wells in the same row . Neutralization curves were plotted using the neutcurve Python package ( https : / / jbloomlab . github . io / neutcurve / , 0 . 3 . 1 ) . This package fits a three - parameter Hill curve , with the top baseline fixed to one and the bottom baseline fixed to zero . The neutralization curves are shown in Supplementary Figure 1 . Period seroprevalence analysis Period seroprevalence was calculated over two - week periods at the individual level . We calculated the percentage of all tested patients that had a seropositive sample during each time period . Individuals were counted a single time even if multiple samples from a single time period were tested . If an individual contributed samples to multiple time periods , they were counted for each time period .
