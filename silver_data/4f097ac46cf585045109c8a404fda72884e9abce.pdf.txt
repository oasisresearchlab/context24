Gene Expression Correlations in Human Cancer Cell Lines Define Molecular Interaction Networks for Epithelial Phenotype Kurt W . Kohn * , Barry M . Zeeberg , William C . Reinhold , Yves Pommier Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology , Center for Cancer Research , National Cancer Institute , Bethesda , Maryland , United States of America Abstract Using gene expression data to enhance our knowledge of control networks relevant to cancer biology and therapy is a challenging but urgent task . Based on the premise that genes that are expressed together in a variety of cell types are likely to functions together , we derived mutually correlated genes that function together in various processes in epithelial - like tumor cells . Expression - correlated genes were derived from data for the NCI - 60 human tumor cell lines , as well as data from the Broad Institute’s CCLE cell lines . NCI - 60 cell lines that selectively expressed a mutually correlated subset of tight junction genes served as a signature for epithelial - like cancer cells . Those signature cell lines served as a seed to derive other correlated genes , many of which had various other epithelial - related functions . Literature survey yielded molecular interaction and function information about those genes , from which molecular interaction maps were assembled . Many of the genes had epithelial functions unrelated to tight junctions , demonstrating that new function categories were elicited . The most highly correlated genes were implicated in the following epithelial functions : interactions at tight junctions ( CLDN7 , CLDN4 , CLDN3 , MARVELD3 , MARVELD2 , TJP3 , CGN , CRB3 , LLGL2 , EPCAM , LNX1 ) ; interactions at adherens junctions ( CDH1 , ADAP1 , CAMSAP3 ) ; interactions at desmosomes ( PPL , PKP3 , JUP ) ; transcription regulation of cell - cell junction complexes ( GRHL1 and 2 ) ; epithelial RNA splicing regulators ( ESRP1 and 2 ) ; epithelial vesicle traffic ( RAB25 , EPN3 , GRHL2 , EHF , ADAP1 , MYO5B ) ; epithelial Ca ( + 2 ) signaling ( ATP2C2 , S100A14 , BSPRY ) ; terminal differentiation of epithelial cells ( OVOL1 and 2 , ST14 , PRSS8 , SPINT1 and 2 ) ; maintenance of apico - basal polarity ( RAB25 , LLGL2 , EPN3 ) . The findings provide a foundation for future studies to elucidate the functions of regulatory networks specific to epithelial - like cancer cells and to probe for anti - cancer drug targets .

The vast amount of data on gene expression in cancer cells should assist in reaching that goal , but effectively utilizing that information remains challenging . Most malignant solid tumors derive from epithelial tissues and retain epithelial characteristics to a variable degree that correlates inversely with malignant virulence . We aimed to utilize gene expression data for cell lines derived from various human tumors to elucidate molecular interaction networks controlling functions key to epithelial cell types , leading eventually to deeper understanding of the factors that govern transitions to mesenchymal character , a change that is thought to be central to acquisition of the ability of cancer cells to invade tissue and form distant metastases . The current work focuses on genes that are expressed selectively in epithelial cells , while a subsequent communication will focus on transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal cell states . Epithelia are arguably the best defined as well as the embryonically earliest multicellular phenotype . A prominent characteristic essential to epithelia is tight junctions , which help to hold adjacent cells together and regulate transport of molecules through the paracellular space between adjacent cells [ 1 ] . Expression of a subset of genes that are associated with tight junctions may therefore serve as an indicator of epithelial character . This would be in accord with the general principle that genes that are expressed together in a variety of circumstances or cell types are likely to function together . The relative expression levels of over 23 , 000 genes in the National Cancer Institute’s 60 human tumor cell lines ( NCI - 60 ) have been assembled into a freely and readily accessible database [ 2 ] . In a previous study , we showed that a set of mutually PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99269 expression - correlated genes over the NCI - 60 cell lines could be assembled into networks that control cell migration [ 3 ] . We now show that a subset of the NCI - 60 cell lines that are selective in expression of certain tight junction - associated genes serve as a signature for epithelial character of tumor cells , and that genes positively correlated with that signature can be assembled into networks involved in the control of epithelial functions . We show that the expression patterns in the NCI - 60 human cancer cell lines correlates well with expression in the CCLE / Broad cell lines . Although gene expression at the mRNA level is not the sole determinant of corresponding protein expression ( for which we do not yet have adequate data ) , the function correlations are striking . The current work combines gene expression correlations with molecular interaction information directly from current scientific literature to assemble molecular interaction networks specific to epithelial - like cells . In addition to the bioinformatics analysis , an integral part of this study includes a comprehensive review of molecular interactions of genes ( and gene products ) having epithelial - related functions in human cancer cell lines . Methods Gene expression profiles and correlations for NCI - 60 human tumor cell lines were obtained using the ‘‘Gene transcript level z score’’ web - based tool provided by CellMiner ( http : / / discover . nci . nih . gov / cellminer / ) . This tool provides relative quantitation for the cell lines from five microarray platforms [ 2 ] . CellMiner provided z - score correlations ( r ) of the expression of a given gene with respect to selectivity for the NCI - 60 epithelial consensus ( NEC ) cell lines ( see below and Table 1 ) . Of the 22 , 379 genes for which there were validated data for the NEC genes in the CellMiner database , the fraction of genes having z - score ( r ) values greater than 0 . 90 , 0 . 80 , 0 . 70 , 0 . 60 , 0 . 50 , 0 . 40 were respectively 0 . 0005 , 0 . 0023 , 0 . 0056 , 0 . 013 , 0 . 027 , 0 . 059 . Gene expression data ( CCLE _ Expression _ Entrez _ 2012 - 09 - 29 . gct ) for human tumor cell lines of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia ( CCLE ) of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard were downloaded from ( http : / / www . broadinstitute . org / ccle / data / browseData ? conversationPropagation = begin ) . The down - loaded file was pre - processed using a combination of UNIX commands and R programs , e . g . , to remove entries for which the gene name was missing . The expression values for each gene were converted to a z - score across all samples in the dataset ( i . e . , mean zero and unit standard deviation ) , using the R program scale . The resulting matrix of gene expression profiles was saved as an R object . An in - house R package was used to compile and normalize the data from individual samples into a coherent dataset for each cancer type . The expression values for each gene were converted to a z - score across all samples in the dataset ( i . e . , mean zero and unit standard deviation ) , using the R program scale ( ) . The resulting matrix of gene expression profiles was saved to hard drive as an R object . Clustered image maps for gene expression and correlations were generated using an in - house R package . Information on molecular interactions and functions was assembled from recent literature in PubMed . The number of cited references was limited by citing recent publications that contain citations to earlier literature . The molecular interaction maps ( MIMs ) were prepared using the notation described by Kohn et al [ 4 ] and at http : / / discover . nci . nih . gov / mim / . The MIM symbols used in the current work are defined in Figure 1 . The MIMs in the current work were constructed using the PathVisio - MIM software [ 5 ] . Table 1 .

The structural core of tight junctions is generally composed of one or more proteins from each of the following genes or gene families : TJP1 - 3 , claudins ( CLDN1 - 27 ) , OCLN / occludin , MARVELD3 , and MARVELD2 / tricellulin [ 8 ] . We asked whether a subset of those tight - junction - family genes would exhibit an expression pattern of mutually correlated genes within the NCI - 60 panel of human tumor cell lines . That pattern of selective expression could be a signature for epithelial character of human tumor cell lines in culture . Using the CellMiner NCI - 60 analysis tools [ 2 ] , we found that 7 members of the tight - junction - family genes formed a consensus pattern of mutually expression - correlated genes in 11 of the 60 NCI - 60 cell lines . Figure 2 shows how closely those gene expression profiles resemble each other . Structurally associated with tight junctions are adherens junctions whose central component is the epithelial marker , CDH1 / E - cadherin . Because of that functional relationship and the close similarity of its NCI - 60 expression profile with that of the tight - junction genes displayed in Figure 2 , we included CDH1 in an epithelial consensus signature ( Figure 3 , Table 1 ) . The high mutual expression correlation of the genes listed in Table 1 is seen in Figure 4 . Selective expression of those mutually correlated genes therefore was selected as a possible signature for epithelial character of human tumor cell lines in culture . We refer to those genes and the NCI - 60 cell lines selectively expressing them as the ‘‘NCI - 60 epithelial consensus ( NEC ) ’’ signature . Although selec - tive expression of NEC genes may be indicative of epithelial character , it may or may not indicate the presence of normal tight and adherens junction structures . Figure 3 shows that the NCI - 60 gene expression profile for CDH1 / E - cadherin ( and thus of the NEC genes in general ) is nearly a mirror image of that of the mesenchymal marker gene , VIM / vimentin , suggesting that mesenchymal genes have selec - tively low expression in the NEC cell lines . The genes whose expression was highly selective in the NEC cell lines may be epithelial - like , and the genes whose expression was selectively low in the NEC cell lines may be mesenchymal or , more generally , non - epithelial . The expression correlations of the NEC genes and cell lines in the context of all NCI - 60 cell lines and all tight junction and cadherin gene family members is shown as a clustered image map ( CIM ) in Figure 4 . We see that the NEC genes cluster is a subset of the tight junction and adherens junction gene families . In addition to the NEC genes listed in Table 1 , Figure 4 suggests that CDH3 ( P - cadherin ; correlation of gene expression with that of the NEC genes , r = 0 . 55 ) could be included in the cluster . CDH3 will be seen to co - cluster with the bone fide NEC genes in other data sets ; therefore we consider CDH3 to be an ex - officio member of the NEC group . Many of the gene family members included in the CIM do not have epithelial - related functions or are expressed at plasma membrane regions other than tight junctions . CDH2 / N - cadherin , for example , forms adherens junctions in mesenchymal cells , which do not have cell - cell junctions of the type that is unique to epithelial cells [ 9 ] . Claudins ( CLDNs ) differ in their abilities to seal cell - cell junctions , and some of them form anion - or cation - specific channels in the narrow space between adjacent epithelial cells [ 10 ] . Expression of Tight - junction and Cadherin Family Genes in the CCLE Human Tumor Cell Lines Derived from Epithelial Tissues Since the NCI - 60 contain a limited number of cell lines per tissue type , we asked whether the NEC subset of tight - junction and cadherin family would also be evident in the data for the much larger number of human tumor cell lines of the Broad Institute’s Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia ( CCLE ) [ 11 ] . Using the same set of genes that were used in the CIM of gene expression in the NCI - 60 cell lines ( Figure 4 ) , we prepared CIMs of mRNA expression in CCLE breast and colon cell lines ( Figures 5 and 6 , respectively ) . These CIMs show that the NEC genes listed in Table 1 ( except for OCLN , for which we found no data in CCLE ) cluster together both in the CCLE breast and colon lines ( Figures 5 and 6 , red box ) , as they did in the CIM for the NCI - 60 ( Figure 4 ) . In addition to the 7 NEC genes , those clusters included CDH3 / P - cadherin in the breast lines and TJP2 / ZO - 2 in the colon lines . Figure 5 suggests that 16 / 58 ( 28 % ) of the CCLE breast cancer cell lines are non - epithelial . For the CCLE colon cancer cell lines ( Figures 6 and 7 ) , the corresponding fraction is 7 / 61 ( 11 % ) . The expression correlations between gene pairs are shown in CIMs for CCLE breast and colon lines in Figures 8 and 9 , respectively . For both the breast and the colon lines , the 7 NEC genes appear in a tight mutually correlated cluster ( Figures 8 and 9 , red box ) . These findings support the idea that the NEC genes serve as a signature for epithelial character in human tumor cell lines derived from epithelial tissues , and show minor variations of the composition of the NEC gene cluster in cancer cell lines from various tissues . In addition , both the breast and colon CIMs show a tight inversely correlated cluster ( Figures 8 and 9 , blue box ) , consisting of CDH2 , CDH4 , CDH6 , CDH11 , CDH13 , and CLDN11 , except that the breast cluster also contains MARVELD1 . These genes thus tend to be down - regulated in the CCLE breast and colon cancer cell lines , and may function primarily in non - epithelial or mesenchy - mal cell types ( which is well known for CDH2 / N - cadherin ) . Thus the co - expressed NEC subset of tight - junction and cadherin family genes ( Table 1 ) is also evident in the CCLE human tumor cell lines derived from epithelial tissues . Most of the colon cell lines uniquely also express CDH17 ; selective expression of CDH17 is seen in 35 of the 54 ( 65 % ) epithelial - like CCLE colon lines ( Figure 6 ) . Among those 35 cell lines , 21 ( 60 % ) also express CLDN2 ; and among those 21 lines , 6 ( 29 % ) additionally express CLDN15 ( Figure 6 ) . Selective expres - sion of CDH17 stands out as being specific to a large fraction of colon cell lines ; this was also apparent in the NCI - 60 gene expression profile where CDH17 was selectively expressed in 4 of the 7 colon cell lines ( Figure 7 ) . Thus colon cancer cells , and perhaps also colon cancers , may be stratified on the basis of expression of these genes . Expression of CDH17 in colon cancer cell lines , as well as colon cancer tissues , was previously reported by [ 12 ] . High expression of CDH17 was associated with reduced survival of colorectal cancer patients . CDH17 was found associated with beta1 integrin and other factors suggesting effects on cell adhesion and extracellular matrix interactions . In the CCLE ovarian cancer cell lines , approximately half of the lines showed high expression of CLDN16 , although the distinction between epithelial - like and mesenchymal - like cell lines was not clear .

We ask however whether other genes selectively expressed in the NEC cell lines have additional epithelial - related functions , which would further test the inference that NEC gene expression provides a signature for epithelial character of tumor cells . Having defined an NEC cell line signature based on selective expression of a subset of tight junction and cadherin family genes , we used the pattern comparison tool of CellMiner to identify other genes selectively expressed ( or selectively not expressed ) by those NEC cell lines . We found 76 genes whose z - score correlations with respect to selective expression in the NEC cell lines was r . 0 . 75 . For each of those 76 genes , we assembled information about molecular interactions and functions from recent scientific literature . We found relevant information for 44 of the genes ( ‘‘NEC - correlated epithelial genes’’ ; Table 2 ) ; the remaining 32 had no published information linking them to epithelial - specific functions ( Table 3 ) , but these genes likely have functions in epithelial tumor cell lines that remain to be discovered . Genes that exhibited the strongest negative correlations with respect to selective expression in the NEC cell lines ( ‘‘NEC - anti - correlated genes’’ ) are listed in Table 4 . Those genes may have non - epithelial or mesenchymal functions . Figure 3 .

As expected , they show a sharp dichotomy between epithelial - like and non - epithelial cell lines with the NEC cell lines in a tight cluster ( upper red box ) . Interestingly , 8 of the 9 melanoma cell lines cluster together ( bottom red box ) , suggesting that gene expression patterns in these cell types differs from other non - epithelial cell types . Particularly notable in these melanoma cell lines is that they tend to express ZEB2 selectively , but not ZEB1 ( arrows at bottom of the CIM ) . We then asked whether this gene expression dichotomy , which was based on NCI - 60 data , would hold up in CCLE cell lines . We found that this is clearly true for CCLE cell lines derived from breast , colon , and ovary ( Figures 11 – 13 ) . Moreover , these mRNA expression CIMs allow us to estimate the fraction of the cell lines from each tissue type that have a non - epithelial or mesenchymal gene expression pattern ( Table 5 ) . The values for the breast and colon lines were very close to those that were based on expression of tight - junction and adherens junction genes ( Figures 5 and 6 , Table 5 ) . The CCLE ovarian cancer cell lines had a relatively Figure 4 . Clustered image map of NCI - 60 mRNA expression levels for tight junction family and cadherin family genes .

The next question is whether those gene sets participate in a coherent functional network . In the current work we address that question for the epithelial - related genes in Table 2 , as well as interacting genes whose NEC correlation is significant , although not high enough to meet the criteria for inclusion in Table 2 . In the following description of the molecular interactions of NEC - correlated genes , the first occurrence of a gene name in each section is shown in bold , along with the correlation value ( r ) for selective expression in the NEC lines , as given by CellMiner . Molecular Interactions and Signaling at Cell - cell Junctions of Epithelial - like Cancer Cells Many of the most highly NEC - correlated genes were found to interact in a molecular interaction network related to cell - cell junctions : tight junctions , adherens junctions , and desmosomes ; these genes are colored red in the molecular interaction map ( MIM ) in Figure 14 ) . The relevant network interactions and functions of the NEC - correlated genes implicated in these functions are described below . At its first occurrence in each section , the name of each of those genes is in bold type along with its NEC expression correlation ( r ) . Interactions at Tight Junctions The central components of tight junctions include members of the claudin family of genes , which encode tetra - spanning transmembrane proteins that associate laterally to form circum - ferential anastomosing bands near the apical region of epithelial cells . Their extracellular domains , which associate intercellularly in the space between adjacent cells , regulate ionic paracellular permeability between apical and basolateral regions of the extracellular space , and allow ion permeation with selectivity that differs among different claudins [ 13 ] [ 14 ] } [ 6 ] . The claudins whose expressions correlated most closely with the NEC cell line pattern were CLDN3 , 4 and 7 ( r = 0 . 76 , 0 . 80 and 0 . 93 , respectively ) ( Figure 4 ) . Note that the expression pattern for CLDN7 ( r = 0 . 93 ) is a nearly perfect match to the NEC pattern . Closely associated with the claudins in tight junctions is OCLN / occludin ( r = 0 . 58 ) , although its precise role in tight junctions is not clear . When epithelial cells migrate during wound healing , OCLN in complex with INADL ( r = 0 . 69 ) moves from cell - cell junctions to the leading edge of the migrating cells [ 15 ] . Also included in the tight junction structure are MARVELD3 ( r = 0 . 95 ) , a tetraspanning transmembrane protein [ 8 ] and MARVELD2 / tricellulin ( r = 0 . 77 ) , which is localized at 3 - cell junctions in the epithelial monolayer [ 10 , 14 ] . Note that MARVELD3 , like CLDN7 , exhibited a nearly perfect match to the NEC pattern ( Figure 2 ) . Tight junction structures include members of the TJP / zona occludens family , of which only TJP3 / ZO - 3 ( r = 0 . 87 ) correlated strongly with the NEC gene expression pattern ( Figure 4 ) . TJP proteins link tight junctions with the cortical actin cytoskeleton and are required for its structural integrity [ 16 – 18 ] . Possibly also involved is CGN / cingulin ( r = 0 . 80 ) , which can bind both TJP1 – 3 and actomyosin [ 19 , 20 ] ( Figure 14 ) . The TJP involvement may differ among cell types . We find TJP3 most prominently correlated with the expression of other NEC genes . In the CCLE colon cancer cell lines , however , TJP2 correlated in the same cluster with the NEC genes ( Figure 6 ) , and TJP1 appeared in the NEC - correlated gene cluster in the CCLE ovarian cancer cell lines . Thus , while TJP3 was selectively expressed in epithelial - like cancer cell lines , TJP1 and 2 , which are known also to participate in tight junction structures , may have more general functions in most of those cell lines . Directly associated with tight junctions are CRB3 / Crum3 ( r = 0 . 81 ) and INADL / Patj ( r = 0 . 69 ) ( Figure 14 ) , which bind to each other and are part of a complex that maintains apical / basolateral polarity of epithelial cells [ 21 , 22 ] . This complex is down - regulated upon epithelial - mesenchymal transition [ 23 ] . CRB3 also binds LLGL2 ( r = 0 . 80 ) , which participates in the complex that maintains apical / basolateral polarity . LLGL2 was able to reverse an epithelial - mesenchymal transition [ 24 ] . Tight junctions are also affected by the trans - membrane glycoproteins EPCAM / TACSTD1 / TROP1 ( r = 0 . 84 ) and TACSTD2 / TROP2 ( r = 0 . 64 ) , both of which bind CLDN7 ( Figure 14 ) . In the absence of EPCAM , CLDN7 protein ( but not Figure 7 .

Unlike EPCAM , which is expressed in various epithelia , TACSTD2 is expressed in stratified epithelia , but not in colonic or other simple epithelia [ 26 ] . EPCAM binds CLDN7 tightly and inhibits its degradation , but does not localize at tight junctions . Instead it localizes at lateral cell - cell junctions , where it sequesters CLDN7 in regions distinct from tight junctions [ 27 ] . Although localized similarly to adherens junctions , EPCAM does not bind CDH1 / E - cadherin . These Figure 8 .

This unusual circumstance of an NEC - correlated gene associated with perturbation of epithelial cell - cell junction structures suggests a possible abnormality of epithelial cancer cell lines in culture , which however remains to be tested in normal epithelial cells . One possibility is that EPCAM is associated with epithelial cell proliferation during wound healing , and that epithelial cancer cell lines in culture proliferate as in wound healing , thus explaining the highly NEC - correlated EPCAM expression . Consistent with this possibility , EPCAM induces transcription of cyclin D1 ; in the absence of EPCAM , cyclin D1 , phosphorylated - Rb and cell cycle progression are suppressed [ 28 ] . Figure 9 .

The manner in which the actions of LNX1 are functionally integrated however remain to be elucidated . Interactions at Adherens Junctions Closely associated with tight junctions are adherens junctions , of which CDH1 / E - cadherin ( r = 0 . 77 ) is the major structural component . Additional components of adherens junctions are CAMSAP3 ( r = 0 . 76 ) and PLEKHA7 ( r = 0 . 52 ) , which bind to each other in a complex that could bring together several components : CAMSAP3 binds the minus ends of microtubules , and PLEKHA7 binds CTNND1 / p120 - catenin ( r = 0 . 48 ) , which in turn binds CDH1 / E - cadherin [ 20 , 32 , 33 ] ( Figure 14 ) . The complex formed by these bindings links adherens junctions to microtubules . PLEKHA7 also binds CGNL1 / paracingulin , which binds CGN ( possibly indirectly ) [ 20 ] , thereby potentially linking between adherens junctions and tight junctions . Such linkage however would not be effective in the NEC cell lines , because these plastic - grown cells did not express CGNL1 . Adherens junctions are disassembled when CDH1 / E - cadherin is taken into endosomes , an action that is promoted by ARF6 and inhibited by ADAP1 / CENTA1 ( r = 0 . 82 ) . Thus ADAP1 , whose expression is highly NEC - correlated , maintains adherens junctions and pre - serves epithelial character [ 34 , 35 ] ( Figure 14 ) . Interactions at Desmosomes Desmosomes confer strong cell - cell adhesion in association with adherens junctions in epithelial cells and provide linkage to the cytoskeleton , particularly keratin intermediate filaments . The interactions of the desmosomal proteins are shown in Figure 14 . Desmocollins , such as DSC2 ( r = 0 . 60 ) , and desmogleins , such as DSG3 ( r = 0 . 38 ) , are desmosomal cadherins that form calcium - dependent cell - cell junctions similar to those of the adherens junctions of CDH1 / E - cadherin . Plakophilins , such as PKP3 / plakophilin ( r = 0 . 71 ) , and JUP / plakoglobin ( r = 0 . 70 ) , constitute Table 3 .

PKP3 is transcriptionally repressed by ZEB1 , an NEC - negatively correlated gene ( r = – 0 . 58 ) , thereby loosening epithelial cell - cell adhesion and promoting cell invasion and metastasis [ 36 ] . In stratified epithelia , desmoplakin links desmosomes to intermediate filaments . Another desmosome component , PPL / periplakin ( r = 0 . 76 ) , binds EVPL / envoplakin ( r = 0 . 49 ) and the two bind intermediate filaments [ 37 ] . PPL associates with ANXA9 / annexinA9 ( r = 0 . 81 ) ; the two proteins , whose expression is highly correlated with the NEC genes , co - localize at cell - cell junctions of epithelial cells [ 38 ] . ANXA9 has been reported to be up - regulated in prostate and colon cancers [ 39 ] , but details of its function have not been elucidated . The PPL - EVPL dimer associates with desmosomes via the N - terminal region of PPL [ 40 ] . Thus the mRNA expressions of 5 of the 7 above - mentioned epithelial desmosomal proteins correlated strongly ( r . 0 . 60 ) with the NEC gene expression pattern ( Figure 14 ) , while the remaining 2 correlated at lower but yet significant levels . Figure 14 shows how desmosomal proteins contribute to epithelial - specific interac - tions , several of which are mediated by JUP / plakaglobin . JUP / plakoglobin ( r = 0 . 70 ) is a structural component of both desmosomes and adherens junctions , where it binds the cytoplas - mic tail of CDH1 / E - cadherin [ 36 , 41 ] ( Figure 14 ) . Plakoglobin helps maintain epithelial character and low proliferation rate . It binds to and inhibits the pro - mesenchymal actions of nucleophos - min ( Figure 14 ) , and may thereby convert mesenchymal cells to an epithelial - like state with low proliferation rate and reduced invasiveness [ 42 ] . In conjunction with TCF / LEF , plakoglobin functions as a transcription factor , which can act as a switch to induce expression of DSC2 and repress DSC3 [ 43 ] . Although DSC2 / desmocollin ( r = 0 . 60 ) was highly correlated with the NEC gene expression pattern , DSC3 lacked significant correlation . Thus Plakoglobin may signal LEF1 to transcriptionally activate the desmosomal cadherin DSC2 ( Figure 14 ) , which functions in epithelial cells as opposed to mesenchymal cells . Plakoglobin also binds and stabilizes NME1 / NM23 - H1 via CTNNA1 / alpha - catenin , which would tend to inhibit metastasis [ 44 , 45 ] ( Figure 14 ) . Plakoglobin binds DSG3 / desmoglein ( r = 0 . 38 ) , which Table 4 . All genes negatively correlated ( r , – 0 . 6 ) with respect to selective expression in NEC cell lines .

Thus JUP / plakaglobin is central to several epithelial - specific functions shown in the molecular interaction map in Figure 14 . DSP / desmoplakin ( r = 0 . 62 ) binds the epithelia - specific keratin intermediate filaments KRT8 ( r = 0 . 63 ) , KRT19 ( r = 0 . 63 ) and KRT18 ( r = 0 . 59 ) . In intestinal epithelium , these keratins function to maintain proper architecture of microvilli even without linkage to desmosomes [ 47 ] . However in stratified epithelia , keratins appear to be required to maintain desmosomes . During epithelial - mesenchymal transition , disassembly of desmosomes preceded loss of E - cadherin [ 48 ] . KRT8 / 18 reduced the sensitivity of human carcinoma cell lines to cisplatin , and depletion of KRT8 / 18 increased cisplatin - induced apoptosis [ 49 ] . The expression of KRT8 was closely correlated with that of BTG4 ( r = 0 . 54 relative to NEC ; r = 0 . 92 relative to KRT8 ) , which has anti - proliferative properties [ 50 ] . Indirect Interactions with Epithelial Cell Surface Complexes Several NEC - correlated genes interact indirectly with tight or adherens junctions , regulate their functions , and link them to other cell structures ( Figure 14 ) . The largest number of interactions impacting cell surface complexes emerge from transcription factors GRHL1 and GRHL2 ( r = 0 . 83 and 0 . 89 ) , suggesting key rolls in the functions in the of epithelial cell - cell junctions ( Figure 14 ) . In particular , GRHL1 and / or 2 up - regulate the transcription of CLDN4 and CDH1 , as well as RAB25 ( r = 0 . 94 ) , whose expression is almost perfectly correlated with the NEC genes . RAB25 also enhances the expression of CLDN4 , induces its localization in tight junctions , and activates the transcription of TACSTD2 ( r = 0 . 62 ) , a binder of CLDN7 at tight junctions [ 51 ] ( Figure 14 ) . TACSTD2 is expressed in stratified epithelia , but not in colonic or other simple epithelia [ 26 ] ) . GRHL2 promotes transcription of ERBB3 ( r = 0 . 54 ) , which forms an oncogenic heterodimer with ERBB2 ( r = 0 . 37 ) in breast cancer cells [ 52 ] . In the NCI - 60 , ERBB3 was selectively expressed in the 2 epithelial - like breast cancer cell lines ( MCF7 and T47D ) and in most of the colon lines , but also in most of the melanoma lines . Although GRHL2 is a transcription factor that targets several epithelial - related genes ( Figure 14 ) , its alternatively spliced isoform has a dominant - negative effect [ 52 ] . GRHL2 also stimulates the expression of PCNA and is generally expressed in carcinomas , but not in normal tissues [ 53 , 54 ] . This highly NEC - correlated gene , which is also highly correlated with the expression of epithelial - related genes in the CCLE breast , colon , and ovarian cancer cell lines ( Figures 10 – 13 ) , thus may be involved in conferring proliferation capability to epithelial cancer cells , such as would occur in normal epithelial cells during wound healing [ 55 ] . The expression of CDH1 / E - cadherin is further enhanced by the highly NEC - correlated LLGL2 ( r = 0 . 80 ) , which associates with tight junctions via the highly NEC - correlated CRB3 ( r = 0 . 81 ) ( Figure 14 ) . LLGL2 thereby tends to suppress tumor growth and metastasis . In addition , there appears to be an inverse relationship between LLGL2 and SNAI1 / snail in regard to transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal cell states [ 24 , 56 ] . Interactions in Intestinal Epithelial Cells Several NEC genes were selectively and sometimes exclusively expressed in the NCI - 60 colon cancer cell lines and have intestine - specific functions . Some of their interactions are included in the molecular interaction map in Figure 14 . At the brush border of intestinal epithelial cells , actin fibers are bundled through the action of VIL1 / villin - 1 ( r = 0 . 68 ) and PLS1 / plastin - 1 / fimbrin ( r = 0 . 64 ) ( Figure 14 ) . VIL1 links the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane by binding phosphatidyli - nositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate and PLCG1 / phospholipase C gamma1 [ 57 ] ( Figure 14 ) . PLS1 was expressed selectively , and VIL1 exclusively , in the NCI - 60 colon cancer cell lines , consistent with their role in crosslinking actin fibers at the core of microvilli in intestinal epithelium . The normal progression of intestinal epithelial cells from crypt to villus involves the highly NEC - correlated gene ELMO3 ( r = 0 . 88 ) , which is activated by the transcription factors CDX2 and SP1 [ 58 ] . CDX2 is an intestine - specific transcription factor whose expression has been reported to be reduced in most human colon cancer cases . In the NCI - 60 , it was expressed in only 2 cell lines : colon HCC2998 and HCT15 . CBLC / CBL3 ( r = 0 . 86 ) and EPHA1 ( ephrin receptor A1 ) ( r = 0 . 82 ) are both expressed highly selectively in the NEC cell lines , including all of the NCI - 60 colon cancer cell lines , except SW620 , and both are expressed selectively in the epithelial - like CCLE colon and breast cancer cell lines ( not shown ) . CBLC is expressed specifically in epithelia , most prominently in intestinal epithelia , where it is expressed mainly in post - proliferative cells in villi [ 59 ] . Mutation or knockdown of CBLC can promote motility and proliferation of breast and non - small - cell lung cancer cell lines . Moreover , CBLC overexpression can inhibit migration and Table 5 .

EFNA1 ( ephrin - A1 ) ( r = 0 . 53 ) , is a membrane receptor tyrosine kinase that avidly binds its major ligand located on an adjacent cell and is expressed mainly in epithelial tissues . Of the 10 EPHA receptors , only EPHA1 was expressed highly selectively in the NEC cell lines . When activated by interaction with EFNA1 , EPHA1 binds and inhibits integrin - linked kinase ILK , enhances adhesion to extracellular matrix , and inhibits cell migration and invasion [ 61 ] . Ephrin receptors may stabilize cell - cell or cell - matrix junctions by interacting with CDH1 ( E - cadherin ) , claudins , or integrins [ 62 ] . EPHA1 is often overexpressed in colorectal carcinoma . However in advanced disease its expression tends to be low ( due to DNA methylation ) and associated with lower survival [ 63 ] . FGF19 ( r = 0 . 61 ) was expressed exclusively in 5 colon cell lines of the NCI - 60 ; its receptor FGFR4 ( r = 0 . 44 ) was expressed in most of those colon cancer cell lines but also in the breast cancer Figure 14 . Molecular interaction map ( MIM ) of interactions at cell - cell junction complexes . Genes selectively expressed in the NCI - 60 epithelial consensus ( NEC ) cell lines are shown in red . Symbol definitions are shown in Fig . 1 . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0099269 . g014 Molecular Interactions in Epithelial Cancer Cell Lines PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 20 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99269 MCF7 and several other cell lines . In colon HCT116 and COLO205 ( which were among the NCI - 60 cell lines that expressed FGF19 and FGFR4 ) , FGF19 promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of CTNNB1 / beta - catenin and inhibited its binding to CDH1 / E - cadherin [ 64 ] . Consequently CTNNB1 became activated and therefore stimulated TCF / LEF transcrip - tion factors , leading to enhanced transcription of cyclin D1 and other TCF / LEF - target genes . This pathway from FGF19 to TCF / LEF seems to prime cultured epithelial - like cells for replication . FGF19 uniquely binds and activates FGFR4 [ 65 ] . FGF19 - activated FGFR4 releases CTNNB1 / betaCatenin from CDH1 / E - cadherin , allowing CTNNB1 to enter the nucleus and activate cyclin D transcription via TCF / LEF [ 65 ] ( Figure 14 ) . The above interactions may be relevant to adenopolyposis coli induced by APC mutations , a common pre - cancerous process that activates the same CTNNB1 - TCF / LEF pathway . MACC1 ( metastasis associated colon cancer 1 ) ( r = 0 . 80 ) was selectively expressed in the NCI - 60 colon cancer cell lines , as well as most of the other NEC cell lines . It binds and activates the MET promoter and enhances cell proliferation , motility and scattering in a MET and HGF - dependent manner that induces nuclear translocation of MACC1 . MACC1 and MET mRNA expression are directly correlated with metastasis in colon cancer , and MACC1 is a useful clinical marker for the ability of tumor cells derived from epithelial tissues , such as colon and stomach , to metastasize [ 66 – 68 ] . Down - regulation of MACC1 suppressed colorectal cell proliferation , migration and invasion [ 69 ] . The MACC1 core promoter has functional sites for AP - 1 , Sp1 , and C / EBP [ 70 ] , and is a target of miR143 , whose expression tends to be diminished in colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines . MACC1 may act as master regulator of the HGF - MET signaling pathway [ 67 ] , and is strongly expressed in gastric and intestinal epithelia [ 71 ] . The selective expression of CDH17 , as well as CLDN2 and CLDN15 , in colon cancer cell lines has already been noted above in relation to Figure 6 ( red arrows ) . Regulation of Alternative RNA Splicing Alterative RNA splicing at consensus nucleotide sequences is an efficient way a master controller protein can simultaneously regulate the function of multiple pathways . Although we do not have adequate data on the expression levels of alternative transcripts , we did find splice - regulators among the highly NEC - correlated ( or negatively - correlated ) genes . A central control of mesenchymal to epithelial transition by way of altered RNA splicing involves ESRP1 and 2 ( epithelial splicing regulatory proteins 1 and 2 ) ( r = 0 . 97 , 0 . 85 ) [ 72 ] . Forced expression of ESRP1 inhibits epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition , and ectopic expression of either ESRP1 or ESRP2 switched RNA splicing of several genes from a mesenchymal to an epithelial pattern . In particular , ESRP1 or 2 switch CTNND1 / p120catenin expression to a form that binds CDH1 / E - cadherin at adherens junctions [ 72 ] ( Figure 14 ) . Fibroblast growth factor FGF2 ( r = – 0 . 44 ) and its receptor FGFR1 ( r = – 0 . 38 ) are implicated in repression of epithelial genes via ZEB1 / 2 [ 73 ] . FGFR1 has alternative splice variants that are specific for epithelial and mesenchymal cells , respectively . ESPR1 and 2 mediate a switch to the epithelial variant [ 73 ] . mRNA splicing is also modulated by the RNA - binding protein QKI / Quaking , which exhibited a negative expression correlation with that of the NEC cell lines ( r = – 0 . 71 ) [ 74 , 75 ] . Regulation of Vesicle Transport and Cell Polarity Vesicles such as endosomes move cell components along microtubules from one site to another , thereby regulating both cell structure and signaling functions at various locations in the cell , and inducing epithelial cell polarity . Internalization and recycling of cell surface components in endosomes regulates signaling and ion channels at the cell surface of polarized cells [ 76 , 77 ] . Some of the genes implicated in these functions were expressed in the NCI - 60 epithelial consensus ( NEC ) cell lines with high degree of selectivity . Endocytosis is mediated in part by epsins [ 78 ] . Of the 3 epsins , EPN3 / epsin - 3 ( r = 0 . 83 ) was expressed selectively in the NEC cell lines . EPN3 is involved in the transport of endosomal cargo proteins to and from the apical surface of epithelial cells . These cargo proteins include sodium ion channels , NOTCH ligands , and epithelial growth factor ( EGF ) receptors , which are removed from the cell surface in endosomes and then may be recycled to the cell surface , thereby regulating the functions of these molecules [ 78 ] . The EPN3 N - terminal domain binds PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P2 , which is enriched at endocytic sites of the plasma membrane ; this interaction induces a conformational change in EPN3 that promotes membrane curvature , which promotes the formation of clathrin - coated pits and endocytosis . C - terminal to that domain , EPN3 has a ubiquitin binding - domain that recruits mono - or oligo - ubiquitinated cargo proteins to the nascent endosome . C - terminal to that domain are clathrin - binding sites that recruit the clathrin coat for the endosome . Thus EPN3 is a key component in the production of clathrin - coated endosomes [ 78 ] . Epsins are required for intercellular communication mediated by NOTCH ligands and receptors [ 79 ] . Of the 4 NOTCH family members , NOTCH3 ( r = 0 . 46 ) exhibited significant expression selectivity in the NEC cell lines . Despite its highly selective expression in the epithelial - like cell lines , however , EPN3 may promote cell migration and invasion [ 78 ] ; epithelial cells may acquire migratory capability when they become carcinomatous without loosing their epithelial character . Another factor involved in vesicle transport along microtubules is the small GTPase RAB25 ( r = 0 . 94 ) , whose expression in the NCI - 60 cell lines was almost perfectly selective for the epithelial - like NEC cell lines , and whose expression is prominent in epithelial tissues [ 80 ] . The transport vesicles may contain proteins , such as ITGB1 and GLUT1 as cargo for delivery to certain locations in the cell [ 81 ] . RAB25 maintains epithelial cell polarity by transporting cargo - containing vesicles to the apical or lateral surfaces of cells in an epithelium or to the focal adhesion processes of epithelial cells that have undergone a transition to mesenchymal form [ 80 ] . The expression of RAB25 is suppressed by the mesenchymal marker VIM / vimentin ( r = – 0 . 86 ) , but is activated by GRHL2 ( grainyhead - like 2 ) ( r = 0 . 89 ) [ 82 ] ( Figure 14 ) . Vesicle transport is promoted by ARF6 , which is inactivated by the GTPase activating protein ( GAP ) ADAP1 / CENTA1 / cen - taurin - alpha1 ( r = 0 . 82 ) . In its active GTP form , ARF6 promotes clathrin - dependent endocytosis of CDH1 / E - cadherin with conse - quent disassembly of adherens junctions and conferring migration and invasion capabilities [ 34 , 35 ] . ADAP1 inhibits these actions , thereby tending to maintain epithelial cell - cell junctions , consistent with the highly selective expression in NEC cell lines ( Figure 14 ) . ADAP1 also regulates cargo transport between plasma membrane and vesicles , and regulates cortical actin cytoskeleton for several processes , including focal adhesions [ 83 ] . Motor function for vesicle transport is provided by MYO5B ( r = 0 . 79 ) and MYO5C ( r = 0 . 73 ) . MYO5B is ubiquitously expressed , whereas MYO5C is expressed mainly in glandular and epithelial cells [ 84 ] . However both proteins were selectively expressed in the NEC cell lines , suggesting specific function in epithelial - like cells . The vesicle transport function of MYO5B may Molecular Interactions in Epithelial Cancer Cell Lines PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 21 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99269 be coordinated by complex formation with RAB25 and / or RAB11A ( r = 0 . 49 ) [ 85 ] ( Figure 14 ) . PLEKHG6 / MyoGEF ( r = 0 . 85 ) is recruited by ezrin to the apical pole of epithelial cells , where it induces the formation of microvilli and membrane ruffles . It forms a complex with ezrin and RhoG or with ezrin and ELMO ( an effector of RhoG ) , wherein PLEKHG6 can activate RhoG in response to EGF in EGFR - expressing cells [ 86 ] . PLEKHG6 and ezrin are both required for macropinocytosis [ 87 ] . PLEKHG6 protein can also bind GIPC1 and is implicated in cancer cell polarization and invasion [ 88 ] . PLEKHG6 is a target of miR - let7i [ 89 ] . Thus PLEKHG6 , RhoG , ezrin , ELMO , GIPC1 , and miR - let7i may be part of a network or networks that regulate cell surface morphology and function in epithelial tumor cells . SCNN1A / ENaC ( r = 0 . 83 ) is a subunit of an epithelial sodium channel that facilitates electrogenic uptake of sodium from the luminal surface of epithelia . It is activated by cleavage of its extracellular domain by ST14 / matriptase ( r = 0 . 89 ) [ 90 ] ( Figure 15 ) . These sodium channels are removed from the plasma membrane in endosomes formed with the participation of clathrin and EPN3 ( r = 0 . 83 ) and may be recycled . Thus at least 3 genes involved in the regulation of these channels were expressed highly selectively in the NEC cell lines . In summary , several of the epithelial - specific genes , identified by their selective expression in the NEC cell lines , are implicated in endocytosis , vesicle transport and cell polarity , including EPN3 / epsin - 3 ( r = 0 . 83 ) , RAB25 ( r = 0 . 94 ) , GRHL2 ( r = 0 . 89 ) , ADAP1 / CENTA1 ( r = 0 . 82 ) , MYO5B ( r = 0 . 79 ) , MYO5C ( r = 0 . 73 ) , AP1M2 ( r = 0 . 75 ) , and PLEKHG6 / MyoGEF ( r = 0 . 85 ) . Genes Involved in Ca ( 2 + ) Signaling Ca ( 2 + ) signaling is involved in coordinating the transport of cargo - containing vesicles from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi to plasma membrane [ 91 ] ; this process may be involved in transport of cargo to specific regions of plasma membrane to maintain epithelial cell polarity . Three Ca ( 2 + ) - related genes exhibited highly selective expression in the NEC cell lines : ATP2C2 / SPCA2 ( r = 0 . 90 ) , S100A14 ( r = 0 . 89 ) , and BSPRY ( B - box and SPRY domain containing ) ( r = 0 . 87 ) . The extraordinary expression selectivity of these genes in the NEC cell lines suggest that their Ca ( 2 + ) - regulated gene products have specific roles in epithelial tumor cell lines , which however are still not well understood . ATP2C2 / SPCA2 is a Ca ( 2 + ) - ATPase that activates calcium channel ORAI1 and mediates uptake of Ca ( 2 + ) and Mn ( 2 + ) by Golgi membranes ; deficiency leads to increased cytosolic Ca ( 2 + ) and Golgi disruption [ 92 ] . ATP2C2 has a Golgi - like distribution in the cell and is abundant in colon , lung , and lactating breast . It localizes at the plasma membrane of intestinal epithelial cells ; in epidermal cells however it has a perinuclear localization consistent with localization at sites of calcium storage [ 93 – 95 ] . ATP2C2 is transcriptionally activated by BHLHA15 / MIST1 ( r = 0 . 51 ) in serous exocrine epithelial cells , including acini of pancreas , salivary , and lactating mammary glands [ 94 ] . S100A14 , an EF - hand Ca ( 2 + ) - binding protein , is the only S100A - family member whose expression was highly selective for the NEC cell lines . It is expressed in several normal epithelial tissues , and low expression is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal tumors and adenocarcinomas of the small intestine [ 96 , 97 ] . It is markedly overexpressed in some tumors of ovary , breast and uterus , but down - regulated in several other tumor tissues . It promotes or inhibits tumor cell invasiveness , depending on p53 status . Promotion of cell invasiveness by S100A14 is mediated by induction of metalloproteinase MMP2 , which is transcriptionally repressed by p53 , which however is in turn transcriptionally repressed by S100A14 [ 98 ] . Although the details of these interactions remain to be worked out , our finding suggest that they are specific for epithelial cancer cells . BSPRY co - localizes and negatively regulates TRPV5 , which is a channel for active calcium uptake by epithelia . BSPRY inhibited the TRPV5 - mediated influx of Ca ( 2 + ) in kidney cells . Thus BSPRY may be a negative regulator of Ca ( 2 + ) transport [ 99 ] . Its role in epithelial tumor cells , suggested by its high selectivity of expression in the NEC cell lines , however remains to be further elucidated . Regulators of Terminal Differentiation of Epithelial Cells The maintenance and cell renewal in epithelial tissues requires delicate controls on cell proliferation and terminal differentiation [ 100 ] . These processes , particularly in skin and kidney , are controlled in part by IRF6 ( r = 0 . 93 ) , OVOL1 ( r = 0 . 83 ) and OVOL2 ( r = 0 . 75 ) ( Figure 16 ) . Terminal differentiation of epithelial cells is also delicately regulated by extracellular serine proteases ST14 / matriptase ( r = 0 . 89 ) and PRSS8 / prostasin / CAP1 ( r = 0 . 83 ) , and their inhibitors SPINT1 / Hai1 ( r = 0 . 88 ) and SPINT2 / Hai2 ( r = 0 . 66 ) . All 7 of these terminal differenti - ation regulators were expressed highly selectively in the NCI - 60 epithelial consensus ( NEC ) cell lines . This is consistent with a continued function of terminal differentiation controls in epithelial cancer cell lines . The known interactions regulating epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation by these components is depicted as molecular interaction maps in Figures 15 and 16 , which show how these genes modulate the balance between proliferation and differentiation of epithelial stem cells . ST14 / matriptase and PRSS8 / prostasin are required for termi - nal differentiation of epithelia [ 101 ] . Together with their inhibitor , SPINT1 / Hai1 , they maintain the structural and functional integrity of epithelia [ 102 , 103 ] . All 3 proteins are usually co - localized in epithelial cells [ 103 , 104 ] . IRF6 ( r = 0 . 93 ) drives the differentiation of epithelial cells , although the mechanism has not been fully defined ; down - regulation of IRF6 inhibits keratinocyte differentiation and promotes RAS - induced tumorigenesis [ 105 , 106 ] . IRF6 transcrip - tionally targets OVOL1 , which is an inhibitor of MYC [ 107 ] . OVOL1 and OVOL2 down - regulate proliferation of both stem cells and proliferating cells through transcriptional inhibition of MYC and MYB ( r = 0 . 35 ) [ 108 , 109 ] ( Figures 14 and 16 ) . OVOL1 is also transcriptionally activated by the CTNNB1 - LEF1 and TGFBR - SMAD pathways , which may thereby control excessive cell proliferation ( Figure 16 ) . As well as inhibiting the transcription of the MYB gene , OVOL1 competes with MYB for binding to promoters of MYB - target genes , including the OVOL1 gene itself . OVOL1 protein thus may bind its own promoter and inhibit its own transcription . OVOL2 is expressed in basal layer of epidermis and is thought to be associated with epidermal stem cells . It directly represses MYC and NOTCH1 , the latter being required for terminal differentiation of squamous epithelia . ( NOTCH1 was expressed in all NCI - 60 cell lines , and therefore did not correlate with NEC cell lines . ) In a negative feedback loop , IRF6 transcription is enhanced by TP63 ( in conjunction with NOTCH1 ) and induces the proteasomal degradation of delta - N - TP63 [ 110 ] . In summary , OVOL1 and 2 are expressed in a variety of epithelial tissues where they seem to restrain cell proliferation and terminal differentiation , while retaining the long - term proliferative potential of stem cells . They seem to modulate the balance between proliferation and differentiation of epithelial stem cells [ 108 , 109 ] . Although the intricacies of the matriptase - prostasin - Hai1 protease system have not been fully elucidated , the essentials of the core of the system have been proposed [ 101 , 102 ] Molecular Interactions in Epithelial Cancer Cell Lines PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 22 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99269 Figure 15 .

ST14 / Matriptase ( r = 0 . 89 ) is thought to be auto - activated by cleavage in trans after oligomerization [ 102 , 103 ] . Nascent ST14 / matriptase appears to be stabilized by tight binding of SPINT1 / Hai1 ( r = 0 . 88 ) , which inhibits ST14 / matriptase enzyme activity . SPINT1 / Hai1 is an unusually effective , albeit reversible , and rapidly acting inhibitor [ 102 , 111 ] . SPINT1 / Hai1 is often present in large ( e . g . , , 10 - fold ) excess over ST14 / matriptase , which is consistent with rapid inhibition of matriptase . This arrangement may cause matriptase activity to be short - lived after transient activation [ 102 , 103 ] , which could serve to clear the cell’s interaction and signaling environment to allow new environmental factors to be sensed . ST14 / matriptase also activates PRSS8 / prostasin ( r = 0 . 83 ) , a glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored serine protease on the plasma membrane . Activation of prostasin and Figure 16 . Regulation of the balance between proliferative and terminally differentiating epithelial cells , based on descriptions by [ 105 , 107 – 109 ] } [ 106 ] . The interaction system involving ST14 / matriptase , PRSS8 / prostasin , and SPINT1 / Hai1 ( detailed in Figure 15 ) is shown here in abbreviated form . The genes that were expressed selectively in the NEC cell lines are denoted in red . The diagram shows terminal differentiation of epithelial cells requiring IRF6 , NOTCH1 , ST14 / matriptase , and PRSS8 / prostasin . The actions of the latter two are inhibited by SPINT1 / hai1 .

Also shown is the regulation of OVOL1 by the TGF beta and beta - catenin pathways . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0099269 . g016 Molecular Interactions in Epithelial Cancer Cell Lines PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 24 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99269 matriptase occurs by cleavage of these proteins , which are both rapidly inhibited by binding SPINT1 / Hai1 [ 102 , 111 ] ( Figures 15 and 16 ) . Matriptase and prostasin are commonly co - expressed in breast cancer cell lines [ 112 ] ; in the NCI - 60 , they were co - expressed along with SPINT1 / Hai1 in the 2 breast cancer cell lines of the epithelial consensus . Matriptase - deficient and prosta - sin - deficient mice have nearly identical epidermal defects [ 102 ] . Matriptase cleaves and activates prostasin during the brief time before being inhibited by Hai1 [ 113 ] ; indeed SPINT1 / Hai1 rapidly inhibits both matriptase and prostasin [ 102 ] . Thus transiently activated matriptase and prostasin , both rapidly inactivated by SPINT1 / Hai1 , may work together to cleave and activate or inactivate epithelia regulatory proteins so as to keep up with potentially changing cell environment . When matriptase activity is uncontrolled , it may destroy or over - activate normal signaling elements in the pericellular environment , leading to uncontrolled growth in carcinomas . PRSS8 / prostasin ( r = 0 . 83 ) is abundantly expressed in normal breast and prostate tissues , but down - regulated in cancers . Matriptase can cleave the extracellular domain of EGFR , and prostasin can enhance this action [ 101 ] . EGFR , like matriptase , localizes to the basolateral surfaces of epithelial cells . Thus EGFR - induced signaling may be one of the pericellular regulatory processes that is periodically cleared by the matriptase - prostasin - Hai1 system in epithelial cells . If periodic activation of prostasin fails , epithelial cells may become permissive for EGFR - induced transition to a migratory of mesenchymal form . SCNN1A / ENaC ( r = 0 . 83 ) is another protein that is cleavage - activated by ST14 / matriptase and has already been discussed above . EHF / ESE3 ( r = 0 . 80 ) regulates the self - renewal of stem - like epithelial cell and favors transition to a differentiation pathway , at least in prostate cells [ 114 ] . EHF / ESE3 inhibits the transcription of mesenchymal effector genes , such as ZEB2 and TWIST1 and consequently inhibits epithelial - to - mesenchmal transition . Sup - pression of EHF / ESE3 favors transition to malignancy . EHF / ESE3 is suppressed by mesenchymal gene VIM / vimentin [ 82 ] . ELL3 ( r = 0 . 75 ) promotes proliferation and cancer stem cell - like properties of breast cancer cells and may confer resistance to 5 - fluorouracil ; these actions are largely due to activation of MEK / ERK signaling [ 115 ] . ELL3 is a transcription elongation factor that suppresses the transient pausing of RNA polymerase II . Additionally , ELL3 stimulates epithelial - mesenchymal transition , suppresses TP53 , and promotes pluripotent differentiation of embryonic stem cells while inhibiting apoptosis [ 116 ] . ELL3 activates the transcription of ZEB1 , which is surprising , because ELL3 and ZEB1 exhibit inverse expression in the NCI - 60 ( as well as in the CCLE breast cancer cell lines ) . ELL3 was selectively and nearly exclusively expressed in the 2 breast and 7 colon cancer cell lines of the NCI - 60 ( NEC ) epithelial profile . In the CCLE data , ELL3 expression was highly correlated with the NEC epithelial profile , particularly in the CCLE breast cancer cell lines ; ELL3 was highly negatively correlated with ZEB1 / 2 ( data not shown ) . Innate Immune Pathways in Epithelial Cells IL17RE ( r = 0 . 81 ) , in complex with IL17RA , binds IL17C and engages in an autocrine mechanism to induce innate immune pathways in epithelial cells [ 117 ] . Genes Negatively Correlated with the NEC Pattern In addition to positively NEC - correlated genes ( Tables 2 and 3 ) , we found many negatively correlated genes , including genes such as VIM / vimentin , associated with mesenchymal cell character ( Table 4 , Figure 3 ) . A clustered image map ( CIM ) of NCI - 60 gene expression , comparing the genes most highly positive with those most negative relative to the NEC pattern showed a sharp distinction between epithelial and non - epithelial genes ( Figure 10 ) . As expected , there is a distinct cluster of NEC cell lines at the top of the CIM . The other cell lines showed consistently low expression of the positively correlated ‘‘epithelial’’ genes . This demonstrates the sharp distinction between epithelial and non - epithelial gene expression in the NCI - 60 cell lines and was confirmed in the CCLE breast , colon , and ovarian cancer cell lines ( Figures 11 – 13 ) . Overview and Conclusions The large amount of accumulated information on cancer - related molecular interactions and gene expression patterns challenges us to use that information to comprehend cell functions . The current work used gene expression data to elucidate cancer cell regulatory functions , based on the premise that genes expressed together in a variety of cancer cell types are likely to function together . We showed how genes mutually co - expressed in human tumor cell lines comprised molecular interaction networks regulating coherent functions in epithelial - like cells . The focus was on genes that confer epithelial - related functions and serves as a foundation for subsequent investigation of the mechanisms that control transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal pheno - type . A unique aspect of the current work is the assembly of detailed and comprehensive molecular interaction maps ( MIMs ) of networks regulating structure and function of epithelial cancer cells ( Figures 14 – 16 ) . That level of detail and coverage will help in the design and interpretation of experiments in which particular genes or interactions are stimulated or inhibited , including the potential effects and side - effects of pharmacological intervention . We first identified a set of mutually co - expressed tight - junction and cadherin family genes in a subset of NCI - 60 human tumor cell lines derived from epithelial tissues ( ‘‘NCI - 60 epithelial consensus , NEC’’ genes and cell lines ) ( Table 1 , Figure 4 ) . Based on selective expression by these NEC cell lines , we derived 76 genes , among which 44 had published information relating to epithelial functions ( Table 2 ) . For many of the 32 remaining genes , there was little or no published information ( Table 3 ) , but their co - expressions suggest that many of them may have epithelial - related functions that remain to be discovered . The epithelial signature for tumor cell lines suggested by the NEC genes was supported by data from the CCLE human breast and colon cell lines ( Figures 5 and 6 ) . Moreover , the dichotomy between epithelial and non - epithelial / mesenchymal gene expression is clear in clustered image maps ( CIMs ) of NCI - 60 as well as CCLE breast , colon , and ovarian cancer cell lines ( Figures 10 – 13 ) . The same was true for CCLE pancreas and stomach cancer cell lines ( not shown ) . A CIM of the large number of CCLE lung cancer cell lines showed distinct epithelial and non - epithelial / mesenchymal gene expression pat - terns , although some cell lines showed mixed patterns arising perhaps from mixtures of cell types in those lines ( not shown ) . We systematically assembled the recently published molecular interaction data for the highly NEC - correlated genes in Table 2 , as well as for some of the lesser correlated genes , and organized them , in molecular interaction maps ( Figures 14 – 16 ) . It is remarkable how many NEC - correlated genes were found to participate in a network of interactions at cell - cell junctions ( Figure 14 ; NEC - correlated genes are shown in red ) . The NEC - correlated genes in the MIM include 7 tight junction genes , 3 adherens junction genes , 6 desmosomal genes , and 17 genes whose products interact directly with the tight junction , adherens junction , and / or desmosome structures . Among these , the most Molecular Interactions in Epithelial Cancer Cell Lines PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 25 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99269 highly connected in the network is the GRHL1 / 2 ( r = 0 . 83 , 0 . 89 ) pair of transcription factors , which target at least 5 NEC genes or their directly interacting species . Also highly connected is JUP / plakoglobin , which interacts with components of adherens junctions and desmosomes , as well as transcription factors TCF / LEF . Its positive effect on TCF / LEF and competition with CTNNB1 / beta - catenin for binding to CDH1 / E - cadherin ( which would tend to release beta - catenin and allow it to enter the nucleus ) suggests that plakoglobin favors cell proliferation . These interactions may feed into the pathway where mutations of the APC gene , common in pre - cancerous colonic polyps , abrogate the degradation of CTNNB1 . NEC - correlated genes may link between cell - cell junctions and cytoskeleton : CGN / cingulin ( r = 0 . 80 ) can bind both tight junctions and F - actin ; CAMSAP3 ( r = 0 . 76 ) links adherens junctions to microtubules ; DSP / desmoplakin ( r = 0 . 62 ) links desmosomes to the intermediate filament keratins KRT8 , 18 , and 19 ( r = 0 . 63 , 0 . 63 , 0 . 59 ) ( Figure 14 ) . An unexpected finding was the disparity between expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2 , which seems not to have been reported previously . In the NCI - 60 melanoma cell lines , ZEB2 had relatively high expression , whereas expression of ZEB1 was relatively low ( Figure 10 ) . In the CCLE breast , colon , and ovarian cancer cell lines , on the other hand , the converse was observed ( Figures 11 – 13 ) . Many NEC - correlated genes have functions involved in maintaining apical - basal polarity , a key feature of epithelial cells [ 24 ] ( Figure 14 ) . Prominent among those genes are LLGL2 ( r = 0 . 80 ) , CRB3 ( r = 0 . 81 ) , INADL ( r = 0 . 69 ) , VIL1 / villin ( r = 0 . 68 ) , and PLS1 / fimbrin ( r = 0 . 64 ) . A particularly important process required to maintain apical - basal polarity is the control of vesicular transport of specific molecules to apical versus basal locations in the cell . Involved in this function were the highly NEC - correlated genes EPN3 / epsin - 3 ( r = 0 . 83 ) , RAB25 ( r = 0 . 94 ) , GRHL2 ( r = 0 . 89 ) , ADAP1 ( r = 0 . 82 ) , and AP1M2 ( r = 0 . 75 ) . These genes are implicated in the incorporation of cell surface components into vesicles . In addition , the motor proteins MYO5B ( r = 0 . 79 ) and MYO5C ( r = 0 . 73 ) move cargo - containing vesicles along cytoskeletal tracks Kashyap et al . , 2013 ) . Epithelial cell - cell junction components , such as CDH1 / E - cadherin ( r = 0 . 77 ) , can be removed by clathrin - dependent endocytosis , leading to degradation and consequent disassembly of adherens junctions . This process is inhibited ADAP1 ( Figure 14 ) , which thereby helps maintain epithelial cell - cell junctions . Also related to this process is the highly NEC - correlated CNN1A / ENaC ( r = 0 . 83 ) , which is involved in regulation of ion channels in the plasma membrane [ 90 ] ( Figure 15 ) . An efficient mechanism of switching between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes may be by way of alternative RNA splicing induced by the highly NEC - correlated genes ESRP1 and ESRP2 ( r = 0 . 97 and 0 . 85 , respectively ) . ESRP1 had the strongest and essentially perfect correlation with selective expression in NEC cell lines ; this is striking because it was not one of the input genes from which the consensus cell lines were derived , nor is it related to any of those genes by sequence , function , or chromosome location . ESRP1 and 2 are not tight junction or adherens junction genes and do not interact with those structures . Instead they control mRNA splicing and are master regulators of an epithelial splicing network [ 72 ] . Cancers derived from epithelia are often defective in the normal transition of cells having sustained proliferative potential to cells undergoing terminal differentiation . Since defective regulation of terminal differentiation allows uncontrolled proliferation of the tumor cells , it is important to understand how terminal differentiation is normally regulated and how the regulation is defective in tumors . Indeed some investigated therapies attempt to induce terminal differentiation of epithelial , as well as other tumor types . We found that a major part of the network regulating epithelial terminal differentiation involves highly NEC - selective genes ( Table 2 ) , which helped us assemble a network model of the differentiation control system . The molecular interaction maps in Figures 15 and 16 , which are based largely on highly NEC - selective genes ( depicted in red ) , propose the following model for a two - part system that intricately regulates the terminal differenti - ation of epithelia . The interactions of each gene / protein shown in Figures 15 and 16 were summarized in greater detail in the Results section , together with supporting references . Epithelial terminal differentiation requires a cleaved form of PRSS8 / prostasin ( r = 0 . 83 ) , the production of which depends in turn on a cleaved form of ST14 / matriptase ( r = 0 . 89 ) ( Figure 15 ) . The protease responsible for these cleavage reactions , as well as of those mentioned below and indicated in Figure 15 , is in fact a dimeric form of ST14 / matriptase . The active cleaved forms would accumulate and reach a balance with degradation processes , producing a long - term integration of the initiating signals over time . The stimulatory effects of PRSS8 / prostasin and ST14 / matriptase are negatively regulated by SPINT1 / Hai1 ( r = 0 . 88 ) . All 3 of these genes were expressed highly selectively in the NEC cell lines ( z - score correlations 0 . 83 , 0 . 89 , 0 . 88 , respectively ; Table 2 ) . The production of the active cleavage products take place in the extracellular region near the cell surface . By diffusion , the differentiation stimulus would therefore be shared among neighboring cells . Thus the differentiation stimulus would spread among the cells of the epithelium , providing an coherent differentiation rate among the cells . If the negative regulation component of the system is defective or does not spread adequately , some regions of the tissue could proliferate without adequate control , as occurs in tumors . In a second level of regulation , epithelial terminal differentiation is dependent on IRF6 ( r = 0 . 93 ) and negatively regulated by OVOL1 and OVOL2 ( Figure 16 ) . IRF6 , OVOL1 , and OVOL2 are highly NEC - correlated and seem to be the core of this part of the regulation system , which appears to be further regulated by an intricate arrangement of positive and negative feedback loops ( Figures 15 and 16 ) . It seems that NOTCH1 is stimulated by IRF6 and negatively regulated by OVOL2 , which is itself negatively regulated by OVOL1 . OVOL1 is transcriptionally activated by IRF6 , which is itself transcriptionally activated by NOTCH1 . Thus IRF6 stimulates epithelial terminal differentiation , but this effect may be dampened in a time - limited fashion by the transcriptional stimulation of OVOL1 . Inputs to the system via regulation of OVOL1 can occur via the TGF beta and beta - catenin pathways . Both pathways transcrip - tionally activate OVOL1 , thereby restricting epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation . The TGF beta pathway couples that action with inhibition of cell proliferation via regulation of cyclin D . The transcriptional inhibition of OVOL1 via beta - catenin is dampened by binding to CDH1 / E - cadherin . Inputs to the system via regulation of OVOL1 can occur via the TGF beta and beta - catenin pathways . Both pathways transcrip - tionally activate OVOL1 , thereby restricting epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation . The TGF beta pathway couples that action with inhibition of cell proliferation via regulation of cyclin D . The transcriptional inhibition of OVOL1 via beta - catenin is dampened by binding to CDH1 / E - cadherin . This model suggests how epithelial terminal differentiation may be highly integrated , both in time and over the cell population , and how some inputs regulate the system . These conjectures invite Molecular Interactions in Epithelial Cancer Cell Lines PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 26 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99269 computer simulations and cell culture experiments and may provide deeper understanding of the regulation defects in cancer . The unusually high NEC correlations of IRF6 ( r = 0 . 93 ) , OVOL1 ( r = 0 . 83 ) , OVOL2 ( r = 0 . 75 ) , ST14 / matriptase ( r = 0 . 89 ) , PRSS8 / prostasin ( r = 0 . 83 ) , and SPINT1 / Hai1 ( r = 0 . 88 ) are striking and indicate that these proliferation / differentiation control genes work together specifically in epithelial tumor cell lines . Finally , it may be noted that expression of many of these NEC - correlated genes is associated with relatively low carcinoma aggressiveness . On the other hand , many of the NEC negatively correlated genes appear to be involved in functions associated with non - epithelial or mesenchymal cell types . These genes and their functions in transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes are of great interest to cancer biology . In summary , gene expression correlations at the mRNA level were remarkably successful as a means to delineate network functions in epithelial - like human tumor cell lines . The expression of a subset of tight - junction genes provided a key whereby expression correlation identified genes functioning in a broad range of epithelia - related molecular interactions . The gene expression correlations , initially derived in the NCI - 60 human tumor cell lines , were consistent with gene expression patterns in the much larger set of CCLE human tumor cell lines of epithelial origin , which provided additional information . The mutually correlated expression of a set of tight junction genes provided a signature for epithelial - like cancer cell lines , distinct from mesenchymal - like tumor cells . The retrieved tight - junction expression - correlated genes had a major role in molecular interaction maps depicting many functions at epithelial cell - cell junctions and depicting regulation of the balance between proliferative and terminally differentiating epithelial cells . Our studies implicated tight - junction expression - correlated genes in a variety of structural and functional characteristics of epithelial cells : ( 1 ) maintenance of junction complexes and desmosomes ; ( 2 ) maintenance of apical - basal polarity by vesicle transport of appropriate components to apical or basal regions of the cell ; ( 3 ) linkage of cell - cell junction components to actin , microtubule , and intermediate filament cytoskeletons ; ( 4 ) control of endosomal recycling or degradation of cell - cell junction components ; ( 5 ) formation of microvilli in intestinal epithelial cells ; ( 6 ) regulation of RNA splicing in a manner promoting epithelial gene variants ; ( 7 ) regulation of terminal differentiation of epithelial cells ; ( 8 ) suppression of tumor growth and metastasis ; and ( 9 ) inhibition of the epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition as well as promotion of the reverse transition .
