IMV can undergo microtubule - based motility , but their directionality and the motor involved in their transport remain unknown . Here , we demonstrate that IMV , like intracellular enveloped virions ( IEV ) , the second form of vaccinia , undergo anterograde transport and recruit kinesin - 1 . In vitro reconstitution of virion transport reveals that IMV and IEV move toward microtubule plus - ends with respective velocities of 0 . 66 and 0 . 56 µm / s . Quantitative imaging establishes IMV and IEV recruit an average of 65 and 115 kinesin - 1 motor complexes respectively . In the absence of kinesin - 1 there is a near - complete loss of in vitro motility and defects in the cellular spread of both virions . Our observations demonstrate kinesin - 1 transports two morphologically distinct forms of vaccinia . Reconstitution of vaccinia - based microtubule motility in vitro provides a new model to investigate how motor number and regulation impacts transport of a bona fide kinesin - 1 cargo . Introduction Kinesin - 1 , the founding member of the kinesin superfamily , anchors and transports a diverse range of cellular cargoes , including vesicles , organelles , protein complexes , and RNPs towards the plus end of microtubules ( Hirokawa et al . , 2009 ; Verhey and Hammond , 2009 ) . Kinesin - 1 is a heterotetramer consisting of two heavy chains that each contain an N - terminal motor domain that is necessary for movement , and two light chains which play important roles in motor regulation and cargo binding ( Bloom et al . , 1988 ; Hackney and Stock , 2000 ; Kaan et al . , 2011 ; Vale et al . , 1985 ) . In humans the kinesin heavy chain ( KHC ) is represented by three different genes that encode closely related isoforms , KIF5A , KIF5B and KIF5C . KIF5B appears to be ubiquitously expressed , while KIF5A and KIF5C are neuronal specific ( Kanai et al . , 2000 ) . Each KIF5 heavy chain homodimer associates near their C - terminus with the heptad repeats of two copies of one of four light chain isoforms ( KLC1 - 4 ) ( Miki et al . , 2001 ) . While KLC2 is ubiquitously expressed and KLC1 is found in most cell types , the other isoforms are tissue specific ( Junco et al . , 2001 ; Rahman et al . , 1998 ) . Despite the importance of kinesin - 1 in transport of many cellular cargoes , we lack a thorough understanding of kinesin - 1 motor - cargo relationships , including motor activation as well as their number and organization on cargoes . This is in part due to the lack of well - defined exemplary kinesin - 1 cargoes , and the challenge of detecting kinesin - 1 on moving cargo using fluorescence - based imaging methods . Kinesin - 1 is also used by a number of different viruses to enhance their replication cycles especially during their egress from infected cells ( Diefenbach et al . , 2002 ; Dodding and Way , 2011 ; DuRaine et al . , 2018 ; Jouvenet et al . , 2004 ; Pegg et al . , 2021 ; Rietdorf et al . , 2001 ; Xu et al . , 15 April 2022 3 Strunze et al . , 2011 ) . Understanding how viruses recruit kinesin - 1 via a limited set of proteins offers a great opportunity to understand the molecular basis of motor recruitment and regulation , as well as their organization on a defined cargo . We previously demonstrated that during vaccinia virus infection , intracellular enveloped virions ( IEV ) recruit kinesin - 1 to mediate their microtubule - dependent transport from their perinuclear site of assembly to the plasma membrane ( Rietdorf et al . , 2001 ) . Disruption of the ability of IEV to recruit kinesin - 1 leads to a dramatic reduction in viral transport to the plasma membrane and cell - to - cell spread of the virus ( Rietdorf et al . , 2001 ; Ward and Moss , 2001 ) . Kinesin - 1 is recruited to IEV by the interaction of A36 , an integral IEV membrane protein with the tetratricopeptide repeats ( TPR ) of the kinesin light chain ( Ward and Moss , 2004 ) . A36 interacts with the TPR via a bipartite tryptophan acidic motif that is also found in many other cellular proteins that bind kinesin - 1 ( Dodding et al . , 2011 ; Pernigo et al . , 2013 ) . More recently , the viral E2 / F12 complex that associates with IEV moving on microtubules ( Dodding et al . , 2009 ) , was shown to enhance kinesin - 1 binding to A36 , suggesting the virus also regulates motor recruitment ( Carpentier et al . , 2015 ; Gao et al . , 2017 ) . However , in infected cells , IEV only comprise a small proportion of total cytoplasmic virions compared to its precursor the intracellular mature virion ( IMV ) , the first infectious form of vaccinia virus assembled during infection ( Carpentier et al . , 2017 ; Leite and Way , 2015 ; Payne and Kristenson , 1979 ) . IEV are formed when IMV acquire an additional membrane cisterna from the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) or early endosomes ( Leite and Way , 2015 ; Schmelz et al . , 1994 ; Tooze et al . , 1993 ) . This envelopment results in the outer surface of IEV having a very different composition of viral proteins from the IMV including the presence of A36 ( Smith et al . , 2002 ) . Previous analysis demonstrates that IMV can move at velocities up to 3 µm / s and are susceptible to nocodazole treatment , strongly implicating microtubules in their transport ( Sanderson et al . , 2000 ; Ward , 2005 ) . It is thought this motility is important to transport IMV from their site of assembly close to the nucleus towards the TGN to facilitate membrane envelopment and IEV formation ( Sanderson et al . , 2000 ; Ward , 2005 ) . In addition , microtubule transport of IMV to the cell periphery may play a role in the cell - to - cell spread of vaccinia as IMV are also capable of directly budding at the plasma membrane ( Meiser et al . , 2003 ; Tsutsui , 1983 ) . Curiously , movement of IMV on microtubules has not been imaged directly and the identity of the motor ( s ) responsible for their translocation to the TGN or plasma membrane remains to be established . Given this , we set out to identify the motor responsible for IMV transport using complementary in vitro and cell - based assays . Our analysis reveals that IMV recruit kinesin - 1 albeit at significantly lower levels than IEV . Moreover , kinesin - 1 is the major motor driving IMV motility in vitro and its loss leads to a significant defect in virion spread during infection . Xu et al . , 15 April 2022 4 Results and Discussion IMV undergo plus end directed microtubule motility To analyse IMV motility , we infected HeLa cells with a recombinant vaccinia strain ∆B5 lacking the viral protein B5 which is essential for IEV formation ( Engelstad and Smith , 1993 ; Wolffe et al . , 1993 ) that also encodes RFP - tagged core protein A3 for visualisation ( Arakawa et al . , 2007 ) . Live - imaging of ∆B5 RFP - A3 infected cells labelled with SiR - Tubulin reveals that IMV undergo a variety of movements , including linear transport along microtubules ( MTs ) and diffusion within the MT network as well as static association with MTs ( Fig . 1A and B and Videos 1 and 2 ) . Moreover , disrupting the MT network with nocodazole results in loss of IMV motility in agreement with previous observations ( Ward , 2005 ) ( Fig . S1 , A - C and Video 3 ) . To analyse IMV movements in detail , we performed automated single particle tracking of fluorescently labelled virions using TrackMate ( Fig . 1C ) ( Tinevez et al . , 2017 ) . Periods of active virion transport were discriminated from phases of diffusive and / or confined motion within each trajectory using TraJ ( Fig . 1C ) ( Wagner et al . , 2017 ) . Using this approach , quantitative analysis of IMV sub - trajectories undergoing active transport reveals that they move at an average velocity of 0 . 61 ± 0 . 35 µm / s over an average run length of 1 . 72 ± 1 . 73 µm ( Fig . 1D ) . These values are lower than IEV which move both faster and further , 0 . 88 ± 0 . 04 µm / s and 6 . 44 ± 0 . 37 µm average velocity and run length respectively ( Dodding et al . , 2011 ) . The directionality of IMV movements is hard to assess in cells , as the dense microtubule network , especially near the nucleus makes it difficult to determine whether virions are moving on single or bundled microtubules . The typical radial microtubule organisation is also disrupted during vaccinia infection , which also compounds the challenge in determining microtubule polarity and direction of transport ( Ploubidou et al . , 2000 ) . Reconstitution of microtubule - based motility in vitro has provided major insights into the properties and regulation of kinesin - 1 ( Block et al . , 1990 ; Chiba et al . , 2021 ; Friedman and Vale , 1999 ; Hooikaas et al . , 2019 ; Jiang et al . , 2019 ; Seitz and Surrey , 2006 ; Svoboda et al . , 1993 ) . Moreover , microtubule - dependent transport of Herpes Simplex Virus in cell extracts has been reconstituted in vitro ( Lee et al . , 2006 ; Wolfstein et al . , 2006 ) . Given this and to overcome the issues of microtubule organization in vaccinia infected cells , we established an in vitro assay to analyse IMV motility on purified single microtubules using extracts from ∆B5 RFP - A3 infected HeLa cells ( Fig . 2A and B ) . In parallel , we also analysed the movement of IEV , which are distinguishable from IMV by the presence of A36 , using extracts from cells infected with the Western Reserve ( WR ) strain of vaccinia expressing A36 - YdF - YFP RFP - A3 ( Fig . 2B ) . The A36 - YdF recombinant virus was used as it is deficient in actin - based motility but not microtubule - based transport ( Rietdorf et al . , 2001 ; Ward and Moss , 2001 ) . We observed that both IMV and IEV could move along Xu et al . , 15 April 2022 5 GMPCPP - stabilised microtubules in an ATP - dependent fashion as the presence of the non - hydrolysable ATP analogue , AMPPNP , inhibited virion motility ( Fig . 2C and D and Videos 4 and 5 ) . Consistent with our cell - based observations , IMV moved at an average velocity of 0 . 66 ± 0 . 14 µm / s ( Fig . 2D ) . In contrast , IEV moved slightly slower in the in vitro motility assay ( 0 . 56 ± 0 . 08 µm / s ) . Both viruses had similar run lengths averaging ~ 8 - 9 µm , often reaching the microtubule end where they sometimes remain stationary rather than detaching ( Fig . 2C and D ) . Interestingly , IMV and IEV always translocate towards one microtubule end and were never observed moving bidirectionally or travelling in opposite directions on the same microtubule , suggesting that they move exclusively to either the plus - or minus - end . The in vitro unidirectional motility of IEV is likely towards the plus - end given they recruit kinesin - 1 in infected cells ( Carpentier et al . , 2015 ; Dodding et al . , 2011 ; Rietdorf et al . , 2001 ; Ward and Moss , 2004 ) . In vitro assays using polarity - marked microtubules with bright plus - ends confirmed this is indeed the case ( Fig . 2E and Video 6 ) . Interestingly , IMV also move towards the microtubule plus - end in 96 % of runs , suggesting their transport is driven by a kinesin ( Fig . 2E and Video 7 ) . It is likely that the 4 % of IMV moving to the minus - end are false - positives due to mislabelling of microtubule plus - ends resulting from microtubule shearing and reannealing events during their preparation ( Fallesen et al . , 2017 ) . Kinesin - 1 is recruited to IMV and IEV Our observations with polarity marked microtubules prompted us to analyse whether kinesin - 1 associates with IMV in infected cells . Immunofluorescence analysis of WR infected HeLa cells reveals that IMV and IEV ( identified by the absence or presence of A36 respectively ) recruit endogenous KIF5B , KLC1 and KLC2 ( Fig . 3A and S1D ) . Furthermore , endogenous kinesin - 1 heavy and light chains as well as GFP - tagged KLC1 and KLC2 associate with IMV in ∆B5 - infected cells ( Fig . 3B and S1D - F ) . Strikingly , the fluorescence intensity of endogenous kinesin - 1 appeared brighter on IEV compared to IMV ( Fig . 3A and S1D ) . Quantification of heavy and light chain fluorescence intensities on virions in WR infected cells demonstrates IEV recruit ~ 2 - fold more kinesin - 1 than IMV , despite the latter comprising the majority of virions assembled during infection ( Fig . 3C ) . This difference in levels suggests that IEV have more binding sites and / or greater affinity for kinesin - 1 than IMV . Interestingly , IMV produced in ∆B5 - infected cells recruited greater levels of KLC2 compared to IMV in WR - infected cells ( Fig . 3C ) . However , no such difference was observed with KLC1 . This may suggest that competition exists between IEV and IMV for binding KLC2 / KIF5B tetramers during WR - infection . Curiously , pulldown assays demonstrate that the IEV proteins A36 and E2 / F12 have preferential binding for KLC1 and KLC2 isoforms ( Gao et al . , 2017 ) . Xu et al . , 15 April 2022 6 A36 recruits kinesin - 1 to IEV by interacting with the KLC tetratricopeptide repeats ( TPR ) ( Dodding et al . , 2011 ; Gao et al . , 2017 ; Rietdorf et al . , 2001 ; Ward and Moss , 2004 ) . We found that IMV also recruit the KLC TPR domain , suggesting they recruit kinesin - 1 via a similar mechanism to IEV ( Fig . S2A and B ) . However , examination of the sequence of IMV surface proteins fails to identify obvious W - acidic or Y - acidic motifs that mediate interactions with TPR repeats ( Dodding et al . , 2011 ; Pernigo et al . , 2018 ; Pernigo et al . , 2013 ; Yip et al . , 2016 ) . A lack of these motifs and a different interaction with the TPR domain such as that seen for JIP3 ( Cockburn et al . , 2018 ) may explain why during WR - infection , 97 - 99 % of all virions with kinesin - 1 were IEV ( Fig . 3D ) . This result is consistent to our in vitro observations using extracts from A36 - YdF - YFP RFP - A3 infected cells , where IEV accounted for ~ 98 % of all virus runs ( Fig . S2C ) . Moreover , the low incidence of kinesin - 1 association with IMV likely explains why this connection was missed in previous studies . The IMV membrane protein , A27 , has been implicated in virion transport as its loss ( using a virus with inducible A27 expression ) resulted in an absence of IMV dispersion away from their perinuclear site of assembly ( Sanderson et al . , 2000 ) . However , there is conflicting evidence , as IMV are still motile in cells infected when the A27 gene is deleted ( Ward , 2005 ) . To investigate if A27 is required for IMV transport we performed in vitro motility assays using the ∆A27 virus , which like the ∆B5 strain , only produces IMV ( Ward , 2005 ) . We found that loss of A27 has no impact on virion motility , indicating that A27 is not essential for IMV transport in vitro ( Fig . S2 D and E ) . Kinesin - 1 drives microtubule dependent movement of IMV and IEV To explore the involvement of kinesin - 1 in IMV motility , we infected a kinesin - 1 knockout ( KO ) HeLa cell line generated by CRISPR / Cas9 targeting of the KIF5B gene ( Jia et al . , 2017 ) as well as a KIF5B rescued line stably expressing TagGFP2 - KIF5B ( Fig . S3A ) . To assess the role of kinesin - 1 in IMV transport we quantified the total number and proportion of IMV that reached within 5 µm of the cell periphery in cells with or without KIF5B ( Fig . 4A ) . This direct comparison is possible as there is no significant difference in cell size in the presence or absence of KIF5B ( Fig . S3B ) . Our analysis reveals that IMV spread was impaired in the absence of KIF5B as significantly fewer IMV reached the cell periphery ( Fig . 4 , B and C ) , despite the ability of IMV to slowly disperse by random diffusion ( Sodeik , 2000 ) . Importantly , this defect was rescued by the stable expression of TagGFP2 - KIF5B in the KIF5B KO cell line ( Fig . 4 , B and C ) . In parallel , we also analysed the impact of the loss of kinesin - 1 on IEV transport to the cell periphery using the A36 - YdF RFP - A3 virus , which is deficient in actin - based transport ( Fig . 4D ) . We found that in the absence of kinesin - 1 there was a dramatic Xu et al . , 15 April 2022 7 reduction in the percentage of cells with peripheral IEV accumulations , that could be rescued by expression of TagGFP2 - KIF5B ( Fig . 4 , E and F ) . Furthermore , TagGFP2 - KIF5B co - localised with IEV at the cell periphery in the KIF5B rescued cell line ( Fig . 4E ) . To extend these observations , we also assessed IMV and IEV motility in vitro using extracts from infected parental , KIF5B KO or KIF5B rescue HeLa cells . Strikingly , there was a 91 % reduction in microtubule - based transport of IMV in extracts lacking KIF5B compared to the parental HeLa control ( Fig . 4G ) . In the absence of kinesin - 1 , the few motile IMV had a 2 . 6 - fold reduction in velocity , 0 . 28 ± 0 . 05 µm / s compared to 0 . 73 ± 0 . 01 µm / s for the control ( Fig . 4G ) . The partial recovery of this phenotype in the KIF5B rescue cells may be due to the reduced concentration of kinesin - 1 in the extract because of the low expression of TagGFP2 - KIF5B in the rescued cells ( Fig . S3A ) . Similarly , IEV displayed negligible rates of motility and reduced velocities / run lengths in the absence of KIF5B that were also partially rescued by the presence of TagGFP2 - KIF5B in extracts from A36 - YdF - YFP RFP - A3 infected cells ( Fig . 4G ) . Taken together , our observations demonstrate that kinesin - 1 mediates the spread of both IMV and IEV from their perinuclear site of assembly to the cell periphery . Kinesin - 1 is clearly the major motor driving IMV and IEV motility . However , in the absence of kinesin - 1 , limited numbers of IMV and IEV are still weakly processive in vitro , suggesting that they may utilise additional kinesin member ( s ) for microtubule - based motility ( Fig . 4G ) . The recruitment of multiple motor classes may help virions navigate the heterogenous microtubule network of the cell as different kinesins have preferences for specific microtubule subsets marked by their post - translational modifications and / or microtubule - associated proteins ( MAPs ) . This has been well documented in neuronal cells ( Hammond et al . , 2010 ; Lipka et al . , 2016 ) but has also been observed in non - neuronal cell types ( Cai et al . , 2009 ; Guardia et al . , 2016 ) . In line with this , kinesin - 1 ( KIF5B ) and kinesin - 3 ( KIF13B ) motors drive efficient transport of Rab6 - positive vesicles along different microtubule populations to reach the cell periphery where they undergo exocytosis ( Serra - Marques et al . , 2020 ) . In future studies , it will be interesting to resolve whether other kinesin members are also recruited by vaccinia virus and if they cooperate with kinesin - 1 to promote virion transport . IEV and IMV recruit large but differing numbers of kinesin - 1 motors Our immunofluorescence analysis indicates that IMV and IEV recruit different numbers of kinesin - 1 motors ( Fig . 3C ) . Given that the absolute number of kinesin - 1 motors on a bona fide cellular cargo remains to be established , we set out to determine the absolute number of kinesin - 1 complexes recruited to IMV and IEV . To achieve this , we used a similar approach as Akamatsu et al . ( 2020 ) using a calibration curve derived from imaging nanocages with a Xu et al . , 15 April 2022 8 known number of attached GFP molecules that are tethered to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 5A ) . To extend the previous calibration curve , we generated an additional nanocage with 180 TagGFP2 molecules , then measured its background - subtracted fluorescence intensity together with the previously described 24 - , 60 - and 120 - mer nanocages using spinning disk confocal microscopy ( Fig . 5B ) . The average fluorescence intensity values were proportional to the predicted numbers of TagGFP2 per nanocage , including the new 180 species ( Fig . 5C ) . To compare the fluorescence intensities of TagGFP2 - tagged nanocages with kinesin - 1 associated with IMV or IEV , we generated an endogenously expressed TagGFP2 - KIF5B HeLa knock - in cell line by CRISPR / Cas9 genome editing and single cell cloning ( Fig . S3C ) . As with our previous TagGFP2 - KIF5B rescue cell line , immunoblot analysis showed that TagGFP2 - KIF5B expression is reduced in the knock - in cell line compared to the untagged motor in the parental cells ( Fig . S3C ) . Nevertheless , all kinesin - 1 motors in the knock - in cell line are fluorescently tagged and amenable for analysis . As the molecule counting method requires imaging z - stacks , the fast microtubule - based movements of IMV and IEV presents a challenge for capturing the intensity of TagGFP2 - KIF5B on moving virions due to the temporal constraints . Live cell imaging , however , reveals that the ratiometric intensity of viral RFP - A3 and TagGFP2 - KIF5B signals in a single z - plane does not significantly change between phases of IMV motility and pausing ( Fig . S3D and Video 8 ) . We therefore quantified the number of kinesin - 1 molecules on stationary IMV and IEV particles in cells infected with ∆B5 RFP - A3 or WR B5 - RFP respectively . In agreement with our previous immunofluorescence analysis , we found IEV recruit more kinesin - 1 than IMV ( Fig . 5 , D and E ) . Comparison of the fluorescence intensity of TagGFP2 - KIF5B on each virion with our nanocage calibration curve reveals that IMV and IEV recruit an average of 130 ± 8 and 230 ± 18 ( mean ± SEM ) KIF5B molecules , which is equivalent to 65 ± 4 and 115 ± 9 kinesin - 1 motor complexes respectively ( Fig . 5E ) . This significant difference in motor number may explain why IEV are more efficient ( longer run lengths ) than IMV in their transport to the plasma membrane . Indeed , in previous experimental and theoretical studies , increasing the number of kinesin motors attached to a cargo leads to further travel distances along the microtubule ( Beeg et al . , 2008 ; Derr et al . , 2012 ; Furuta et al . , 2013 ; Korn et al . , 2009 ; Muller et al . , 2010 ; Vershinin et al . , 2007 ) . We have also observed that impairing the ability of IEV to recruit kinesin - 1 by mutating one of the A36 tryptophan acidic motifs also leads to a significant reduction in run length without affecting viral speed ( Dodding et al . , 2011 ) . Our motor number values are significantly larger than previous studies that typically observe 1 - 11 kinesin motors on a cargo using immunogold labelling in EM sections or are based on inferences from cargo velocities or force measurements ( Ashkin et al . , 1990 ; Gross et al . , 2007 ; Hill et al . , 2004 ; Kural et al . , 2005 ) . Due to the relatively large ≈360 x 270 x 250 nm size of IMV ( Cyrklaff et al . , 2005 ) , it is perhaps not surprising that so Xu et al . , 15 April 2022 9 many kinesin - 1 motors are associated with each virion . Indeed , our values are more in line with the predicted number of kinesin - 1 motor complexes required to transport a vesicle of similar size to a virion over long distances ( > 10µm ) ( Jiang et al . , 2019 ) . It has been suggested that kinesin motors are likely to be clustered on cellular cargoes to ensure more efficient processive transport ( Erickson et al . , 2011 ) . Given this , we wondered how the motors were spatially organised on the virion surface given the relatively large numbers of kinesin - 1 on both IMV and IEV . Super - resolution imaging of fixed ∆B5 - and WR - infected cells using structured illumination microscopy reveals that kinesin - 1 is distributed over the whole IMV or IEV surface ( Fig . 5F , S3E ) . Such an organisation may help the virions navigate the dense cellular microtubule network by allowing them to quickly switch microtubule tracks and / or bypass roadblocks for efficient transport in the crowded cytosol ( Lakadamyali , 2014 ; Tjioe et al . , 2019 ) . Furthermore , given this organisation , it is likely that only a subset of bound motors is active at any given time due to the geometric constraints of motor positioning on the virion relative to a microtubule . Indeed , it is predicted that for a 100 nm vesicle with 35 bound kinesin - 1 motors , three motors are sufficient to engage the microtubule and drive vesicle transport over long 10 µm distances ( Jiang et al . , 2019 ) . However , determining the number of active motors on a cargo in live - cells still remains a considerable challenge ( Cai et al . , 2007 ) , as while cargo binding relieves auto - inhibition it may not always result in full motor activation ( Blasius et al . , 2007 ; Fu and Holzbaur , 2013 ; Kawano et al . , 2012 ; Twelvetrees et al . , 2019 ) without additional regulation through post - translational modifications and / or microtubule - associated proteins ( Chiba et al . , 2021 ; Hooikaas et al . , 2019 ; Manser et al . , 2012 ) . Given our observations , we suggest that vaccinia infected cells offer a powerful model system with which to develop and test sensors for the activation state of kinesin - 1 on moving cellular cargoes . In conclusion , our study shows that kinesin - 1 drives the transport and spread of both intracellular forms of vaccinia virus . In addition , we show for the first time that microtubule - based motility of both IMV and IEV can be reconstituted in infected cell extracts in vitro . This will no doubt provide a useful model system to obtain further insights into motor - cargo relationships and motor regulation . The task ahead is to uncover the mechanistic basis for kinesin - 1 recruitment to IMV and determine how kinesin - 1 recruitment and activation is regulated by IMV and IEV .

The authors have no competing financial interests Xu et al . , 15 April 2022 11 Materials and Methods Cells and generation of stable cell lines HeLa cells lines were maintained in minimal essential medium ( MEM ) or Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % FBS , 100 U / ml penicillin , and 100 µg / ml streptomycin at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Stable HeLa cell lines expressing GFP - KLC1 and GFP - KLC2 were generated using the lentivirus infection ( Trono group second generation packaging system , Addgene ) and selected using puromycin resistance ( 1 µg / ml ) as previously described ( Abella et al . , 2016 ) . The HeLa KIF5B KO cell line was kindly provided by Juan Bonifacino ( NIH , USA ) ( Jia et al . , 2017 ) . Lentiviral expression vectors were used to stably express tagGFP2 - KIF5B in HeLa KIF5B KO cells to generate the HeLa KIF5B rescue cell line . The vectors pLVX GFP - KLC1 and pLVX GFP - KLC2 were generated by sub - cloning the murine KLC1A and KLC2 coding sequences ( Dodding et al . , 2011 ) into the EcoRI / BamHI and NotI / EcoRI sites respectively of a pLVX N - term - GFP parent vector ( Abella et al . , 2016 ) . To generate the pLVX tagGFP2 - KIF5B vector , the murine KIF5B coding sequence was amplified from a plasmid provided by Marvin Bentley ( Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , New York , USA ) ( Yang et al . , 2019 ) , tagGFP2 was amplified from a plasmid provided by David Drubin ( UC Berkeley , USA ) ( Akamatsu et al . , 2020 ) and both inserted between the XhoI and EcoRI sites of the parental pLVX N - term GFP vector using Gibson Assembly ( New England Biolabs ) , following the manufacturer’s instructions . These lentivirus vectors were used to establish stable HeLa cell lines as previously described ( Weisswange et al . , 2009 ) . SnapGene software ( Insightful Science ; available at snapgene . com ) was used to plan and visualise cloning strategies , and to analyse sequencing results . Expression constructs The expression vector pEL KLC2 - TPR has been described previously ( Rietdorf et al . , 2001 ) , KLC sequences comprising residues 1 - 155 of murine KLC2 and residues 1 - 162 or 163 - 538 of murine KLC1A were amplified by PCR and cloned into the NotI / EcoRI site of the pEL N - term GFP parental vector using Gibson Assembly ( New England Biolabs ) following the manufacturer’s instructions ( Rietdorf et al . , 2001 ) . The KLC1A and KLC2 coding sequences used for PCR amplification have been previously described ( Dodding et al . , 2011 ) . The fidelity of all expression constructs was confirmed by sequencing . CRISPR / Cas9 mediated gene editing The HeLa CRISPR - Cas9 knock - in cell line expressing TagGFP2 - KIF5B at the endogenous KIF5B locus was generated using the pORANGE vector containing SpCas9 , purchased from Addgene ( Plasmid # 131471 ) ( Willems et al . , 2020 ) . The guide RNA ( gRNA ) for KIF5B was Xu et al . , 15 April 2022 12 designed using a CRISPR design webpage tool ( https : / / www . benchling . com / ) . The targeting sequence used was as follows ( coding strand sequence indicated ) : 5’ - CCCGGCTGCGAGAAAGATGG - 3’ . CRISPR / Cas9 mediated knock - in of TagGFP2 into the endogenous KIF5B locus was performed according to the protocol described in Willems et al . ( 2020 ) . In brief , HeLa cells were transfected using JetPrime ( Polyplus ) with the pORANGE vector bearing the appropriate gRNA targeting sequence and TagGFP2 insert . The gRNA targets the ATG start codon of KIF5B exon 1 where Cas9 induces a double strand break . The TagGFP2 coding sequence is integrated into the incision site through repair by non - homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) . After initial transfection , cells were allowed to recover for ~ 3 weeks before single - cell colonies were isolated by FACS . Individual clones were screened for biallelic integration of TagGFP2 into the KIF5B loci by junction PCR and immunoblot analyses . Sequencing confirmed successful in - frame integration of the TagGFP2 sequence . Recombinant viruses and infection All recombinant viruses are generated in the Western Reserve ( WR ) strain of Vaccinia virus . The recombinant vaccinia virus strains RFP - A3 and ∆A27 YFP - A4 ( kindly provided by Brian Ward , University of Rochester Medical Center , New York , USA ) have previously been described ( Ward , 2005 ; Weisswange et al . , 2009 ) . The LA - RFP - A3 - RA targeting vector was used to insert RFP - A3 as previously described ( Weisswange et al . , 2009 ) into the genome of the existing viral strains ∆B5 ( Engelstad and Smith , 1993 ) , A36 - YdF ( Rietdorf et al . , 2001 ) , and A36 - YdF - YFP ( Arakawa et al . , 2007 ) . The recombinant strain expressing B5 - RFP was generated by rescuing the ∆B5 virus with a B5 - RFP targeting vector and selecting for an increase in plaque size to that of WR and expression of RFP . For live and fixed cell imaging , HeLa cells on fibronectin - coated coverslips or glass bottomed dishes were infected with the relevant recombinant vaccinia virus in serum - free DMEM at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 1 . After one hour at 37°C , the serum - free DMEM was removed and replaced with complete DMEM . Cells were incubated at 37°C and at 7 . 5 hours post - infection cells were imaged live or were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence analysis . For nocodazole experiments , DMSO control or 33 µM nocodazole was added to culture medium for 1 h prior to fixation or live - cell imaging . Immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis HeLa cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min , blocked in cytoskeletal buffer ( 10 mM MES , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EGTA , 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 5 mM glucose pH 6 . 1 ) containing 2 % ( v / v ) fetal calf serum and 1 % ( w / v ) BSA for 30 min , and then permeabilised with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 5 min . To differentiate between IMV and IEV , cells were stained Xu et al . , 15 April 2022 13 with a monoclonal antibody against A36 ( 1 : 50 ) kindly provided by Geoffrey Smith ( University of Cambridge , UK ) ( van Eijl et al . , 2000 ) followed by a Cy5 goat anti - mouse secondary antibody ( 115 - 175 - 146 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch , 1 : 1 , 000 ) . To visualise IMV in ∆B5 - infected cells , a monoclonal antibody against A27 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) was used followed by a Cy5 goat anti - mouse secondary antibody ( Rodriguez et al . , 1985 ) . To visualise kinesin - 1 , the following primary antibodies were used at the specified dilutions : KIF5B ( ab167429 ; Abcam , 1 : 400 ) , KLC1 ( sc - 25735 ; Santa Cruz , 1 : 400 ) , KLC2 ( HPA040416 ; Atlas Antibodies , 1 : 400 ) , followed by an Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( A11034 ; Invitrogen , 1 : 1 , 000 ) . Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Mowiol ( Sigma ) and image acquired on a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope equipped with a 63x / 1 . 4 NA Plan - Achromat objective and a Photometrics Cool Snap HQ cooled charge - coupled device camera . The microscope was controlled with MetaMorph 7 . 8 . 13 . 0 software . Images were analysed using Fiji and processed with Adobe software package . For structured illumination microscopy , samples were prepared as above and imaged on an Olympus iX83 Microscope with Olympus 150x / 1 . 45 NA X - Line Apochromatic Objective Lens , dual Photometrics BSI - Express sCMOS cameras and CoolLED pE - 300 Light Source ( Visitech ) and was controlled using Micro - Manager 2 . 0 . 0 . Image stacks of 10 - 15 z - slices with 0 . 1 µm steps were acquired and deconvolved using the express deconvolution setting on Huygens Software ( Scientific Volume Imaging ) . For immunoblot analyses , the following antibodies were used at indicated dilutions : β - tubulin ( T7816 ; Sigma , 1 : 10 , 000 ) , GFP clone 3E1 ( Francis Crick Institute , Cell Services STP , 1 : 5 , 000 ) , KIF5B ( ab167429 ; Abcam ; 1 : 1 , 000 ) , KLC1 ( sc - 25735 ; Santa Cruz ; 1 : 1 , 000 ) , KLC2 ( HPA040416 ; Atlas Antibodies ; 1 : 1 , 000 ) , and A27 ( C3 monoclonal , 1 : 1 , 000 ) ( Rodriguez et al . , 1985 ) . Live - cell imaging and Automated Particle Tracking in cells Live - cell imaging experiments were performed at 7 . 5 hours post - infection in complete DMEM ( 10 % FBS , 1 % P / S ) in a temperature - controlled chamber at 37°C . Cells were imaged on a Zeiss Axio Observer microscope equipped with a Plan Achromat 63x / 1 . 40 NA Ph3 M27 oil lens or a Plan Achromat 100x / 1 . 46 NA oil lens , an Evolve 512 camera , and a Yokagawa CSUX spinning disk . The microscope was controlled by the SlideBook software ( 3i Intelligent Imaging Innovations ) . Time lapse images used for automated particle tracking were acquired at a sampling rate of 10 Hz using an exposure of 33 ms for the RFP ( virus ) channel . Xu et al . , 15 April 2022 14 To quantify the number of kinesin - 1 associated with virions , image stacks of 10 z - slices , 0 . 1 µm apart were acquired at 0 . 2 Hz using an exposure of 100 ms or 30 ms for the respective GFP ( kinesin ) and RFP ( virus ) channels . All other movies were typically imaged at 1 Hz using an exposure of 100 ms for each channel . To visualise microtubules in live infected cells , 125 nM SiR - Tubulin ( Cytoskeleton # CY - SC002 ) was added to the culture medium 2 h prior to imaging and were visualised using the FarRed channel . To track viruses in infected cells , we used the Fiji plugin , TrackMate ( Tinevez et al . , 2017 ) . The Laplacian of Gaussian ( LoG ) detector identified virion spots with an estimated diameter of 1 µm and threshold of 30 using a median filter and sub - pixel localisation . We generated whole virus trajectories using the simple linear assignment problem ( LAP ) tracker with a linking distance of 0 . 8 µm and gap closing distance of five frames . These were filtered using a track displacement threshold > 1 μm . The track data was exported and processed using TraJ ( Wagner et al . , 2017 ) to analyse the trajectories , categorising virus tracks into segments ( sub - trajectories ) representing either active transport , normal diffusion , sub - diffusion , or confined motion . The data for active transport was exported to Excel to derive the virion velocities and run lengths . In vitro virus motility assays HeLa cells were grown in 10 cm culture plates until ~ 80 % confluent then infected with relevant virus for 18 h at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 0 . 1 . Infected cells were detached by versene treatment and centrifuged ( 1700 rpm , 5 min , 4°C ) . The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 - pellet volume of assay buffer ( 40 mM HEPES , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM KCl , 1 % Glucose , 1 mM GTP , 10 mM BME ) supplemented with protease inhibitors ( cOmplete TM Mini EDTA - free , Sigma ) and 1 mM phenyl - methyl - sulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) . Cells were lysed through two iterative freeze / thaw cycles and the cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation ( 1700 rpm , 5 min , 4°C ) . The cell extract was kept on ice for not more than 2 h before the start of imaging . An ATP regeneration system ( 2 mM ATP , 25 mM phosphocreatine and 0 . 013 mg / ml creatine phosphokinase at > 150 Units / ml ) and an oxygen scavenging system ( 12 . 5 mg / ml glucose oxidase and 3 mg / ml catalase ) was added to the extract prior to adding into the flow chamber . Tubulin was purified from pig brains as previously described ( Castoldi and Popov , 2003 ) . GMPCPP - stabilised microtubules were polymerised from unlabelled tubulin ( 1 . 42 µM ) , biotin - labelled tubulin ( 0 . 5 µM ) and AlexaFluor 647 - labelled tubulin ( 0 . 27 µM ) in 1X BRB80 ( 80 mM K - PIPES pH 6 . 8 , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA pH 6 . 8 ) containing GMPCPP ( 0 . 5 µM ) for 3 h at 37 o C . Polymerised microtubules were pelleted by centrifugation at 11 , 500 rpm ( 12 , 420 rcf ) for 5 min , gently resuspended in BRB80 and left in dark at room temperature overnight for use Xu et al . , 15 April 2022 15 the following day . Polarity - marked microtubules stabilised with taxol were generated as previously described ( Fallesen et al . , 2017 ) . Glass coverslips were functionalized with a layer of biotin and biotin - PEG ( Rapp Polymere ) , while glass slides were passivated with PLL - PEG ( SuSoS ) as previously described ( Bieling et al . , 2010 ) . Flow chambers forming a ~ 10 µL volume chamber ( chamber size ~ 0 . 5 x 18 x 0 . 1 mm ) , consisted of a biotin - PEG functionalised coverslip attached to a PLL - PEG passivated glass slide via double - sided tape ( Tesa , Hamburg ) . The glass surfaces were passivated with 5 % Pluronic F - 127 ( Sigma ) followed by κ - casein ( 0 . 05 mg / ml ) for 10 min each , then incubated with NeutrAvidin ( Invitrogen ) for 3 min . Polymerised microtubule mix was then added for 10 min before unattached microtubules were removed through several washes using assay buffer . Finally , infected cell extract in assay buffer was added and chambers were sealed with Vaseline ( Unilever ) prior to imaging on a spinning - disc microscope at 37 o C . Images were acquired at 1 frame per second , and each sample was imaged for no longer than 30 min . Image analysis and quantitation Fluorescence intensity of kinesin - 1 antibody labelling was analysed in fixed - cell images using Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . Raw integrated kinesin - 1 antibody signal was measured following the approach of ( Verdaasdonk et al . , 2014 ) by drawing an eight - pixel circle over kinesin - 1 spots colocalising with a virion . The background signal was obtained by drawing a larger ten - pixel concentric circle and measuring the raw integrated density . The area - corrected background intensity was subtracted from the initial eight - pixel region of interest to acquire the fluorescence intensity per kinesin - 1 spot . The constructs that assembled into 24 - , 60 - and 120 - mer nanocages used for the fluorescence calibration standard curve were generated as described previously ( Akamatsu et al . , 2020 ) . To generate a construct that would self - assemble into 180mers , plasmids obtained from the Drubin lab were modified ( Akamatsu et al . , 2020 ) . The NheI / XbaI fragment was replaced by a synthetic construct ( Invitrogen ; Geneart ) where the KPDG aldolase was tagged at the N terminus with two TagGFP2 . GS repeat linkers were included between TagGFP2 sequences . The nanocage constructs were transiently expressed for ~ 26 h in HeLa cells after transfecting cells with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) prior to adding 500 nM AP21967 ( Takara ) to the medium 30 min before imaging to induce self - assembly of nanocages . Average intensity projections of image z - stacks were used to measure the fluorescence intensity per nanocage spot . The background - subtracted intensity of each nanocage was measured as described above and plotted as a function of predicted TagGFP2 copy number per nanocage to obtain the calibration standard curve . A line of linear fit through the origin was applied by linear least - squares fitting . Identical analysis was performed on kinesin - 1 spots that colocalised with Xu et al . , 15 April 2022 16 virions in infected cells to calculate the number of kinesin - 1 associated with IMV or IEV . Quantification was only performed on single stationary spots . To quantify the number of motile IMV in nocodazole experiments , TrackMate was used to identify virus trajectories . A displacement threshold was applied to all tracks to quantify the number of viruses that moved > 3 µm within the 1 min imaging window . In vitro virus motility was analysed by kymograph analysis using the ImageJ Kymograph plugin made by Jens Rietdorf and Arne Seitz ( EPFL Lausanne ) . The Fiji line tool was used to measure constant velocity segments within kymographs and the data was exported to Excel to derive the virus velocities and run lengths . Virus motility rates were calculated as the total number of motile virions detected , normalised to the imaging duration ( in minutes ) and microtubule length ( in mm ) within each field of view . The overall virus motility rate per independent experiment is reported . References Abella , J . V . , C . Galloni , J . Pernier , D . J . Barry , S . Kjaer , M . F . Carlier , and M . Way . 2016 .
