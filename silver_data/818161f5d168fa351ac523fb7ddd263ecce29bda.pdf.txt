JC Virus Enters Human Glial Cells by Clathrin - Dependent Receptor - Mediated Endocytosis M . T . PHO , A . ASHOK , AND WALTER J . ATWOOD * Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology , Brown University , Providence , Rhode Island 02912 Received 4 August 1999 / Accepted 10 December 1999 The human polyomavirus JC virus ( JCV ) is the etiologic agent of a fatal central nervous system ( CNS ) demyelinating disease known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) . PML occurs predomi - nantly in immunosuppressed patients and has increased dramatically as a result of the AIDS pandemic . The major target cell of JCV infection and lytic replication in the CNS is the oligodendrocyte . The mechanisms by which JCV initiates and establishes infection of these glial cells are not understood . The initial interaction between JCV and glial cells involves virus binding to N - linked glycoproteins containing terminal a ( 2 - 6 ) - linked sialic acids . The subsequent steps of entry and targeting of the viral genome to the nucleus have not been described . In this report , we compare the kinetics and mechanisms of infectious entry of JCV into human glial cells with that of the related polyomavirus , simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) . We demonstrate that JCV , unlike SV40 , enters glial cells by receptor - mediated clathrin - dependent endocytosis . JC virus ( JCV ) is a small , nonenveloped , double - stranded DNA containing virus belonging to the family Papovaviridae and the subfamily Polyomavirinae ( 23 , 26 ) . In vivo , JCV infec - tion is restricted to oligodendrocytes , astrocytes , and B lym - phocytes ( 17 , 20 ) . This highly restricted cell type speciﬁcity is also seen in vitro , as JCV infects primary cultures of human glial cells , human glial cell lines , and to a limited extent , pri - mary human B cells and some B - cell lines ( 4 , 17 , 20 , 28 ) . The life cycle of JCV begins with virus attachment to a cell surface glycoprotein receptor containing a - ( 2 - 6 ) - linked sialic acid ( 15 ) . Following attachment , the JCV virion must penetrate the plasma membrane and target its genome to the nucleus . Very little is known about the mechanisms of polyomavirus entry and nuclear targeting . Early work with the mouse polyomavi - rus and simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) demonstrated that these virions were internalized into monopinocytotic vesicles which then accumulated at the nuclear membrane ( 12 , 16 ) . In some stud - ies , viral particles were also seen in the nucleus , suggesting that the nucleus was the site of uncoating ( 7 , 19 , 21 ) . More recent studies have shown that SV40 enters cells by receptor - medi - ated endocytosis into uncoated membrane - bound invagina - tions known as caveolae ( 1 , 2 , 24 ) . An interaction between SV40 and major histocompatibility complex - encoded class I proteins induces the clustering of virus - receptor complexes into caveolin - rich membrane domains ( 5 , 8 , 24 ) . Intracellular signals induced by SV40 binding to cells result in increased caveola - dependent endocytosis of the virus and delivery of the virions to the endoplasmic reticulum ( 9 , 24 ) . It is unclear how the viral genome is then targeted from the endoplasmic retic - ulum to the nucleus . In this report , we studied the kinetics of JCV and SV40 infectious entry into human glial cells . Our results demonstrate that JCV rapidly enters glial cells and is completely internal - ized into a neutralizing antibody - resistant compartment within 30 min . SV40 entered glial cells with slightly delayed kinetics . We next asked whether JCV , like SV40 , utilized caveolae to enter glial cells . Agents that disrupted caveola - dependent en - docytosis signiﬁcantly inhibited infection of glial cells by SV40 but had no effect on infectious entry of JCV . In contrast , agents that inhibited clathrin - dependent receptor - mediated endocy - tosis inhibited infection of glial cells by JCV but had no effect on SV40 infection . These results demonstrate that JCV and SV40 do not share similar mechanisms of internalization . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells , virus , and antibody . The human glial cell line SVG was established by transformation of human fetal glial cells by an origin - defective SV40 mutant and has been previously described ( 18 ) . SVG cells were maintained in a humidiﬁed 37°C CO 2 incubator in Eagle’s minimum essential medium ( Mediatech , Inc . , Herndon , Va . ) supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( Mediatech , Inc . ) . The hybridoma PAB597 , which produces an antibody to SV40 V antigen , was obtained from E . Harlow and maintained in RPMI 1640 Hybri - max medium ( Sigma , St . Louis , Mo . ) supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( Mediatech , Inc . ) . The PAB597 monoclonal antibody has previously been shown to cross - react with JCV VP1 ( 6 ) . Rabbit anti - SV40 anti - serum and preimmune control antiserum were obtained from Lee Biomolecular Research , Inc . ( San Diego , Calif . ) . Rabbit anti - JCV antiserum was prepared by injecting a New Zealand White rabbit with puriﬁed JCV in complete Freund’s adjuvant ( 10 ) . The rabbit was boosted twice with JCV in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant . The antiserum was titered by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay and a Western blot assay . Preimmune serum from this rabbit was used as a negative control . The hybrid Mad - 1 / SVE D virus was constructed by insertion of the regulatory region of SV40 into the regulatory region of the Mad - 1 strain of JCV ( Mad - 1 / SVE ) ( 25 ) . Propagation of Mad - 1 / SVE in human glial cells led to dele - tions and alterations exclusively in the regulatory region . The rearranged regu - latory region contains the origin of replication , the TATA box and 78 bp of the ﬁrst 98 - bp repeat from JCV and one complete 72 - bp repeat from SV40 . Most of one of the 72 - bp repeats and the 21 - bp repeats from SV40 were deleted . The virus is termed Mad - 1 / SVE D to indicate this fact . A comparison of the restriction patterns of Mad - 1 / SVE D DNA with the prototype Mad - 1 DNA were identical except for the regulatory region changes just discussed ( 25 ) . No additional alterations were apparent following subsequent passage of Mad - 1 / SVE D in hu - man fetal glial cells ( 25 ) . We sequenced the VP1 gene of the chimeric virus , and it is identical to the published sequence of VP1 from the prototype Mad - 1 strain ( 15 ) . Virus puriﬁcation and labeling . The preparation and labeling of JCV virions has been described ( 14 ) . In brief , 10 8 SVG cells were infected with 3 , 200 hem - agglutination units ( HAU ) of virus fo r 1 h at37°C . At 3 weeks postinfection when the cells showed extensive cytopathic effect , they were removed from the dishes by scraping and pelleted by centrifugation at 960 3 g for 30 min . The resulting cell pellet was suspended in 30 ml of the supernatant and subjected to three freeze - thaw cycles . Deoxycholic acid was then added to a concentration of 0 . 25 % , and the suspension was incubated at 37°C for 1 h . Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 1 , 960 3 g , and the supernatants were layered on a cushion of cesium chloride ( CsCl ) ( 1 . 34 g / ml ) . Virus was banded by centrifuga - tion for 24 h at 35 , 000 rpm in a SW55Ti rotor . This virus band was removed and dialyzed extensively against phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) ( 137 mM NaCl , * Corresponding author .

Puriﬁed virus was stored in 100 - m l aliquots at 2 80°C . Virus titers were determined by hem - agglutination assay . For virus labeling , 2 . 0 mg of gradient - puriﬁed JCV was dialyzed overnight in labeling buffer ( 0 . 05 M boric acid , 0 . 2 M NaCl [ pH 9 . 2 ] ) . The virus was then incubated fo r 8 h atroom temperature with 50 m l of a solution ( 5 . 0 mg / ml ) of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ; Sigma ) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ; Sigma ) ( 10 ) . The FITC - labeled virus was puriﬁed by centrif - ugation over a cushion of cesium chloride . The FITC - labeled virus band was visualized with a handheld UV light , removed , and dialyzed extensively against PBS ( pH 7 . 2 ) . The ratio of FITC to protein was determined by spectrophotom - etry . Kinetics of infectious entry . SVG cells growing on coverslips were incubated with either 128 hemagglutination units ( HAU ) of JCV or 10 5 PFU / ml of SV40 for 30 min at 4°C . The cells were then washed three times in ice - cold PBS and shifted to 37°C in growth medium . Neutralizing concentrations of anti - JCV or anti - SV40 antiserum were then added to the cells at 0 , 30 , 60 , 120 , and 180 min following the shift to 37°C . Control coverslips were incubated with preimmune antiserum . At 3 days postinfection , the cells were ﬁxed in acetone and the percentage of infected cells was scored by staining with an anti - V antigen mono - clonal antibody . Inhibition of infectious entry . SVG cells growing on coverslips were incubated with phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) ( 10 . 0 m M in DMSO ) , nystatin ( 10 m g / ml in DMSO ) , or chlorpromazine ( 10 m g / ml in distilled water ) for 45 min at 37°C . Control cells were incubated in medium with or without DMSO . The cells were then incubated with either JCV or SV40 fo r 4 h at37°C in the continued presence of the drug . The cells were then washed three times in PBS and incubated with neutralizing concentrations of anti - JCV , anti - SV40 , or preim - mune control antiserum . Infected cells were scored at 3 days postinfection as described above . Internalization of transferrin . SVG cells were treated with PMA , nystatin , or chlorpromazine for 45 min at 37°C . The cells were then incubated with tetram - ethylrhodamine - conjugated transferrin ( TRITC - transferrin ) for 20 min at 37°C in the continued presence of the drug . Control cells were incubated with TRITC - transferrin in medium alone . The cells were then washed three times in PBS and ﬁxed in PBS containing 2 % paraformaldehyde for 1 h . The cells were washed twice in PBS and mounted onto slides with Vectashield mounting medium containing 4 9 , 6 9 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) ( Vector Laboratories , Bur - lingame , Calif . ) . Fluorescence was visualized at a magniﬁcation of 3 63 by laser - scanning confocal microscopy ( LSM 410 ; Zeiss , Inc . , Thornwood , N . Y . ) . Colocalization of transferrin and JCV in endosomes .

Infection was initiated by warming the cells to 37°C . Neutralizing concentrations of anti - JCV , anti - SV40 , or preimmune control serum was added to the cells at 0 , 30 , 60 , 120 , and 180 min following the shift to 37°C . Infection was scored at 3 days postinfection by indirect immu - noﬂuorescence analysis of V antigen - positive cells . The addi - tion of neutralizing anti - JCV antiserum to the SVG cells at the time that they were shifted to 37°C resulted in a signiﬁcant inhibition of infection ( Fig . 1 ) ( time zero ) . This same anti - serum had a minimal inhibitory effect on infection when added 30 min following the shift to 37°C and had no signiﬁcant effect if added at later time points ( Fig . 1 ) . Preimmune antiserum did not inhibit infection of SVG cells by JCV at any of the time points tested ( Fig . 1 ) . Similar to the results with JCV , neutral - izing anti - SV40 antiserum inhibited infection of glial cells by SV40 if added immediately at the time of the shift to 37°C ( Fig . 2 ) ( time zero ) . This antiserum also inhibited infection if added at 30 min following the shift to 37°C but had little to no effect if added at later time points ( Fig . 2 ) . The preimmune anti - serum had a slight inhibitory effect on infection of SVG cells by SV40 at all time points tested ( Fig . 2 ) . JCV infectious entry is inhibited by disruption of clathrin - mediated endocytosis but not by disruption of caveola - medi - ated endocytosis . To determine whether JCV entered cells by a caveola - dependent pathway or by a clathrin - dependent path - way , SVG cells were treated with drugs that selectively inhibit each of these pathways . Treatment of the cells with PMA or nystatin , both of which inhibit caveola - dependent endocytosis , had no signiﬁcant effect on infection of SVG cells by JCV ( Fig . 3 ) . In contrast , treatment of the cells with chlorpromazine , which inhibits clathrin - dependent endocytosis , signiﬁcantly in - hibited infection of the cells by JCV ( Fig . 3 ) . Chlorpromazine had no effect on JCV infection if added 24 h postinfection , indicating that the effect of chlorpromazine occurs at an early step in the life cycle of the virus ( data not shown ) . In contrast to the results using JCV , nystatin and PMA both inhibited infection of SVG cells by SV40 , whereas chlorpromazine was without effect ( Fig . 4 ) . As a control , we studied the effects of PMA , nystatin , and chlorpromazine on the internalization of TRITC - transferrin . Transferrin is known to be internalized by clathrin - dependent receptor - mediated endocytosis , which re - sults in a characteristic punctuate pattern of staining in the cytoplasm . As expected , chlorpromazine , but not PMA or nys - tatin , inhibited the internalization of labeled transferrin ( Fig . 5 ) . Colocalization of JCV and transferrin in endosomes . We next asked whether JCV and transferrin colocalize in endo - somes . Cells were incubated with FITC - JCV and TRITC - transferrin for 20 min at 37°C . The cells were then ﬁxed in 2 % paraformaldehyde , mounted onto slides in mounting medium containing DAPI , and analyzed by conventional and laser - scanning confocal microscopy . FITC - JCV and TRITC - trans - ferrin could both be seen in small punctate clusters within the cytoplasm as well as in larger clusters that were adjacent to the nucleus ( Fig . 6 , panels A and B ) . DAPI - stained nuclei were visualized using a conventional epiﬂuorescent microscope ( data not shown ) . An overlay of the red and green channels FIG . 5 .

As expected , colocalization was blocked by chlorpromazine ( Fig . 6 , panel D ) . DISCUSSION To infect a glial cell , JCV must bind to speciﬁc cell surface receptors , penetrate the plasma membrane , and target its dou - ble - stranded DNA genome to the nucleus . We have previously characterized the ﬁrst step in this process and have identiﬁed the JCV receptor as an N - linked glycoprotein containing ter - minal a ( 2 - 6 ) - linked sialic acids ( 15 ) . To begin to address the subsequent steps of viral entry and nuclear targeting , we com - pared infectious entry of JCV with that of the related poly - omavirus , SV40 . In our ﬁrst experiment , we compared the kinetics of infec - tious entry of JCV and SV40 . To do this , virus was allowed to adsorb to SVG cells for 30 min at 4°C , and then infection was initiated by warming the cells to 37°C . At various time points following the shift to 37°C , virus that remained at the cell surface was neutralized by the addition of anti - JCV or anti - SV40 antiserum . Infection was scored 3 days later by staining the cells with an anti - V antigen monoclonal antibody . This monoclonal was chosen as SVG cells constitutively express SV40 T antigen . Our results demonstrated that JCV entered into an antibody neutralization - resistant compartment within 30 min following the shift to 37°C . These data are consistent with our previous report showing that JCV enters into a tryp - sin - resistant compartment within 10 min postadsorption ( 28 ) . SV40 entered cells with slightly delayed kinetics , which is con - sistent with other published studies ( 1 ) . We next used the antibody neutralization assay in conjunc - tion with pharmacological agents to ask whether JCV infected cells by clathrin - dependent endocytosis or by caveola - depen - FIG . 6 .

We used the drug chlorpromazine to inhibit clathrin - dependent endocytosis and PMA and nystatin to in - hibit caveola - dependent endocytosis . Chlorpromazine is a cat - ionic amphiphilic drug which prevents the recycling of clathrin and thus prevents endocytosis by clathrin - dependent mecha - nisms ( 11 , 27 ) . The phorbol ester PMA inhibits the caveola - dependent pathway by constitutively phosphorylating caveolin which is critical for internalization of these vesicles ( 3 ) . The antibiotic nystatin is a known sterol binding agent and acts to remove membrane cholesterol , which is important for both the maintenance of caveolae and for the ability of caveolae to seal off from the plasma membrane ( 3 , 13 , 22 ) . Note that PMA and nystatin had previously been shown to inhibit infectious entry of SV40 in monkey kidney cells ( 1 ) . SVG cells that had been pretreated for 45 min with chlorpromazine , PMA , or nystatin were infected with either JCV or SV40 for 4 h at37°C in the continued presence of the drug . The 4 - h time point was chosen to allow sufﬁcient time for both JCV and SV40 to completely internalize into an antibody neutralization - resistant compart - ment . Our data demonstrate that chlorpromazine , but not PMA or nystatin , inhibited infectious entry of JCV . In contrast , PMA and nystatin both inhibited infectious entry of SV40 , whereas chlorpromazine was without effect . As both a positive and negative control for the speciﬁcity of the drugs , we tested whether chlorpromazine , PMA , or nystatin had any effect on the clathrin - dependent endocytosis of TRITC - transferrin . Only chlorpromazine inhibited uptake of labeled transferrin , which is consistent with its effects on clathrin - dependent en - docytosis . In a ﬁnal experiment , FITC - JCV and TRITC - transferrin were colocalized in endosomes , indicating that JCV shares this clathrin - dependent pathway of endocytosis with transferrin . As expected , the colocalization of JCV and transferrin in endo - somes was blocked by chlorpromazine . Our data conﬁrm that infectious entry of SV40 proceeds by caveola - dependent endocytosis and demonstrate that JCV , un - like SV40 , infects cells by clathrin - dependent endocytosis . This is consistent with our previous data showing that JCV and SV40 do not share receptor speciﬁcity on human glial cells ( 14 , 15 ) . These results , when taken together , suggest that receptor usage dictates the endocytic pathway used by different poly - omaviruses to penetrate the plasma membrane . The mecha - nisms that target the JCV genome to the nucleus are currently under investigation .
