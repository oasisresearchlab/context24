Brief Communication 89 Tyrosine phosphorylation is required for actin - based motility of vaccinia but not Listeria or Shigella Friedrich Frischknecht , Sally Cudmore , Violaine Moreau , Inge Reckmann , Sabine Röttger and Michael Way Studies of the actin - based motility of pathogens have provided important insights into the events occurring at the leading edge of motile cells [ 1 – 3 ] . To date , several actin - cytoskeleton - associated proteins have been implicated in the motility of Listeria or Shigella : vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ( VASP ) , vinculin and the actin - related protein complex of Arp2 and Arp3 [ 4 – 7 ] . To further investigate the underlying mechanism of actin - tail assembly , we examined the localization of components of the actin cytoskeleton including Arp3 , VASP , vinculin and zyxin during vaccinia , Listeria and Shigella infections . The most striking difference between the systems was that a phosphotyrosine signal was observed only at the site of vaccinia actin - tail assembly . Micro - injection experiments demonstrated that a phosphotyrosine protein plays an important role in vaccinia actin - tail formation . In addition , we observed a phosphotyrosine signal on clathrin - coated vesicles that have associated actin - tail - like structures and on endogenous vesicles in Xenopus egg extracts which are able to nucleate actin tails [ 8 , 9 ] . Our observations indicate that a host phosphotyrosine protein is required for the nucleation of actin filaments by vaccinia and suggest that this phosphoprotein might be associated with cellular membranes that can nucleate actin .

We found that whereas a - actinin , Arp3 , VASP and the VASP - related protein Mena were found throughout the vaccinia actin tail , only VASP was observed on the viral particle . In contrast to vaccinia , we observed vinculin on Shigella during actin - tail initiation but it was only weakly visible in the actin tail ( Figure 2 ) . Previous localization studies together with experiments demonstrating that vinculin binds IcsA , the protein both necessary and sufficient for Shigella actin - tail formation [ 10 ] , have led to the suggestion that vinculin plays an essential role in Shigella motility [ 5 , 6 ] . Observa - tions from infections of vinculin - deficient cells , however , suggest that vinculin is not essential for actin - based motil - ity of Shigella [ 11 ] . Our results show that localization of vinculin during Shigella actin - tail formation is identical to that observed for a - actinin , Arp3 , VASP and zyxin ( Figure 2 ) . Although vinculin binds IcsA it is clear that localization to the bacterium cannot be assumed to reflect an essential role in Shigella actin - tail formation . A defini - tive answer about the role of vinculin in Shigella actin - tail formation will only be achieved by performing depletion and rescue experiments as carried out for the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 7 ] . The localization of VASP to vaccinia suggests that there could be a viral equivalent of the Listeria ActA protein which recruits VASP [ 4 ] . The vaccinia genome does not , however , encode any protein that contains the VASP - binding consensus motif FPPPP ( in single - letter amino - acid code ) [ 12 , 13 ] . Furthermore , loss of the vaccinia protein F8L — the only vaccinia protein with homology to the proline repeats of ActA and its homolog iActA — has no effect on actin - tail formation [ 14 ] or on recruitment of VASP or Arp3 ( data not shown ) . Thus , the recruitment of VASP to vaccinia is likely to be the consequence of addi - tional host proteins . Our observation that vinculin and zyxin are not localized to viral particles during the infec - tion indicates , however , that VASP recruitment to the virus does not involve vinculin , as proposed for Shigella [ 5 , 6 ] , or zyxin , as recently suggested for vaccinia [ 15 ] . Consistent with this , the viral genome does not encode any protein with significant homology to the vinculin - binding domain of IcsA [ 5 ] . In addition , the viral genome does not encode any protein with significant homology to the amino terminus of ActA from Listeria which is able to stimulate the actin - nucleating activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 2 ] . This might explain why we only observe Arp3 associated with vaccinia actin tails and never on the viral particle , whether an actin tail is present or not ( Figure 1 ) . This is in contrast to Listeria or Shigella where Arp3 is associated with non - motile bacteria as well as throughout the actin tail [ 16 ] ( Figure 2 ) . The differences in Arp3 , VASP and vinculin localization in cells infected with vaccinia , Listeria or Shigella suggest that vaccinia uses a different host protein to the bacterial systems to induce the cascade of events that leads to actin - tail formation . In our quest to find the missing factor required for vac - cinia actin - tail formation we observed that the phospho - tyrosine signal associated with focal adhesions was reduced during infection and a prominent phospho - tyrosine signal was observed on viral particles that have induced actin tails ( Figure 3a ) . The phosphotyrosine signal was never observed on vaccinia actin tails , however . The phosphotyrosine signal is unique to vaccinia , as labelling experiments with six different anti - phosphotyro - sine antibodies using various fixation methods failed to detect any phosphotyrosine signal on Listeria or Shigella or their associated actin tails ( Figure 3a ) . Closer analysis showed that this phosphotyrosine signal had a distinct polarized distribution on the viral particle surface at the site of actin - tail assembly ( Figure 3b ) . The phosphotyro - sine signal , like the VASP signal , was not observed on vac - cinia particles without induced actin tails suggesting that it represents a recruited host protein ( data not shown ) . Consistent with this suggestion , no phosphotyrosine signal was observed on viral particles assembled by the recombi - nant viral strains D A34R or D A36R that lack only the viral proteins A34R or A36R , respectively , and are unable to induce actin tails ( data not shown , [ 17 – 20 ] ) . To examine whether the phosphotyrosine protein is the missing factor required for vaccinia actin - tail formation , we micro - injected infected cells with anti - phosphotyro - sine antibodies . Micro - injection of anti - phosphotyrosine antibodies but not control IgG resulted in a dramatic reduction in vaccinia actin - tail formation ( Figure 3c ) . This inhibitory activity was not due to secondary effects on actin dynamics as similar experiments did not affect the ability of Listeria to induce actin tails ( Figure 3c ) . Taken together , these observations indicate that the unknown phosphotyrosine protein — which is not ezrin , a 90 Current Biology , Vol 9 No 2 Figure 1 Localization of vinculin , VASP and Arp3 in HeLa cells infected with vaccinia virus .

Our observations indicate that the phosphotyrosine signal observed on vaccinia particles represents either a cytosolic viral or a recruited host protein . We noticed , however , that in the absence of vaccinia infection our HeLa cells con - tained small phosphotyrosine - tipped actin - tail - like struc - tures that we termed little actin tails ( LATs ; Figure 4a ) . We found that identical cytoskeletal proteins were associ - ated with LATs and vaccinia ( Figure 2b ) . LATs are vari - able in number and appear randomly within the cell population . Their number and appearance was unaffected by confluency , passage number , tissue culture medium , pH , serum starvation , cold , heat or osmotic shock ( data not shown ) . It has previously been reported that lanthanide or zinc treatment of cells induces actin - based ‘rocketing’ motility of endosomes [ 22 ] . To investigate whether LATs might represent rocketing endosomes , we examined whether transferrin receptor or clathrin were present at the tips of LATs . We found that clathrin but not transferrin receptor was associated with LATs , suggesting that LATs are not derived from the plasma membrane and probably originate from the Golgi apparatus ( Figure 4b ) .

It is pos - sible that the phosphotyrosine signal seen on vaccinia virus and LATs represents the same host protein . In support of this hypothesis we never observe LATs in vaccinia - infected cells . In contrast , LATs are observed in cells infected with Listeria or Shigella , a situation where there is no competition for recruitment of the phosphotyrosine protein . The simplest interpretation is that the phosphoty - rosine signal observed on vaccinia and LATs corresponds to the same host protein . In summary , we have shown that , in contrast to bacterial pathogens , an unknown phosphotyrosine protein plays an important role in vaccinia actin - tail formation . In addition , it is possible that the same protein is also associated with cellu - lar membranes that are able to induce actin polymerization , including endogenous vesicles in Xenopus egg extracts [ 8 , 9 ] ( Figure 4c ) . The future identification of the phosphotyro - sine protein associated with vaccinia virus will undoubtedly provide new information about the mechanism of vaccinia actin - tail formation , but more importantly it may also provide further insights into actin – membrane interactions . Materials and methods Immunofluorescence and immuno - electron microscopy Infected cells were processed for immunofluorescence as described [ 20 ] . Immunostaining of actin tails in Xenopus egg extracts was per - formed after stimulated extracts had been allowed to settle for 30 min on 8 - well glass slides . Images were collected using a cooled CCD camera with the OpenLab Software ( Improvision ) on an inverted Zeiss microscope or a Cohu CCD 4910 camera with NIH Image ( Version 1 . 62 ) on a Leica DMRXA microscope . Aquired images were processed and annotated using the Adobe software package . Micro - injection and quantitation HeLa cells infected for 8 – 14 h with vaccinia virus or for 6 h with Liste - ria were micro - injected using the Zeiss automated injection system . Cells were injected with antibodies at a concentration of 5 mg / ml in micro - injection buffer ( 100 mM KCl , 5 mM Na - phosphate , pH 7 . 5 ) . For details of the antibodies see Supplementary material . Cells were processed for immunofluorescence after 1 h recovery at 37°C . Infected cells were identified by labelling with anti - A17L antibody and injected cells were identified by co - injected Texas - red - labelled 70 kDa dextran ( Molecular Probes ) . For each experiment the presence of a single actin tail was scored in injected versus non - injected cells . The presence of a single actin tail within a cell was scored as positive as it is impossible to quantify a reduction in actin tails as their numbers naturally vary greatly between cells [ 20 ] . The data were normalized to the number of infected cells that were not injected but had actin tails .
