One of the key mechanisms that facilitates cancer metas - tasis is the abnormal activation of a developmental process termed epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) 1 – 3 . Aberrant activation of EMT enables primary epithelial cancer cells to acquire advantageous mesenchymal properties , including invasion and drug resistance , ultimately allowing the survival of cancer cells within the circulatory system and subsequent colonization of distant organs 4 – 6 . Whereas several transcription factors , such as Twist , Snail , and Zeb1 / 2 , and signaling pathways , including TGF - β , have been characterized as potent inducers of EMT 6 , 7 , growing evidence has suggested that alternative RNA splicing acts as a critical layer of regulation impinging on EMT 8 – 11 . Alternative RNA splicing is a fundamental mechanism of post - transcriptional gene regulation . With 95 % of human multi - exon genes expressing more than one splice isoform , alternative spli - cing contributes to the diversity and complexity of the human proteome , and thus organ development and tissue identity 12 – 14 . The regulation of alternative splicing relies on the precise binding of splicing factors to the RNA consensus motifs located in vari - able exons or their adjacent introns . Therefore , mutations in either splicing factors or RNA motifs that perturb splicing factor binding may result in developmental abnormalities and diseases 15 , 16 . Although important observations connecting spli - cing machinery and diseases are accumulating , our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of splicing regulation that impinges on diseases is still in its infancy . The functional connection of alternative splicing to EMT and cancer metastasis was established through the study of the CD44 gene , which is alternatively spliced to generate two families of proteins , known as CD44v and CD44s . Following our initial discovery that CD44 isoform switching is essential for EMT 8 , other studies have also reported that epithelial cells that pre - dominantly express CD44v demand an isoform switch to CD44s in order for cells to undergo EMT and for cancer cells to metastasize 17 – 26 . In addition to CD44 , a handful of additional alternative splicing events has subsequently been reported to play a functional role in EMT 27 – 30 . EMT - associated splicing events are controlled by splicing factors and , to a large extent , these splicing factors act in a combinatorial manner to in ﬂ uence splicing 9 , 10 , 31 , 32 . In the case of CD44 alternative splicing , the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M ( hnRNPM ) pro - motes the production of CD44s by binding to CD44 intronic splicing motifs , resulting in an EMT phenotype and enhanced metastasis 10 . The splicing activity of hnRNPM is partially restricted by an epithelial - speci ﬁ c splicing factor ESRP1 through competitive binding to the same RNA motifs , thus tightly con - trolling the switch of CD44 splice isoforms and transition of cell states during EMT 9 , 10 . In addition to this mode of direct com - petition through binding to RNA substrates , it is conceivable that hnRNPM - interacting splicing factors could also in ﬂ uence hnRNPM ’ s activity and thus its function in promoting EMT . In fact , several splicing factors were found to form a complex with hnRNPM 31 , 33 , 34 , but the functional consequences in EMT and cancer metastasis remained unexplored . In this study , we report the identi ﬁ cation of the A kinase anchoring protein 8 ( AKAP8 ) as an RNA - binding protein that inhibits EMT and breast cancer metastasis through the reg - ulation of alternative splicing . AKAP8 interacts with hnRNPM and precludes the activity of hnRNPM to stimulate exon skipping of CD44 . Moreover , AKAP8 is capable of directly binding to RNA and modulating alternative splicing events . Functionally , AKAP8 is required to maintain epithelial - speci ﬁ c alternative splicing patterns . Cells with loss of AKAP8 show accelerated EMT and enhanced breast cancer metastatic potential . We demonstrate that both AKAP8 and its splicing target CLSTN1 accurately predict patient survival . These results identify the splicing factor AKAP8 as a suppressor of EMT and metastatic cancer and shed lights on the mechanisms of EMT and tumor metastasis that are regulated at the level of alter - native RNA splicing . Results AKAP8 interacts with hnRNPM and correlates with patient survival . To identify splicing regulatory proteins that regulate EMT and metastasis , we used hnRNPM as a bait to determine hnRNPM - interacting splicing factors . As hnRNPM stimulates mesenchymal - associated splicing and promotes cancer metas - tasis , we reasoned that these hnRNPM - interacting splicing factors likely affect EMT and tumor metastasis by synergizing with or antagonizing hnRNPM ’ s activity . As depicted in Fig . 1a , we applied a BioID technology that utilizes a biotin - ligase fused to hnRNPM to capture hnRNPM - interacting proteins that are ligated with biotin in live cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Mass spectrometry analysis successfully revealed several previously reported hnRNPM - interacting splicing factors , including RBFOX , SFPQ , and PTBP1 31 , 35 , 36 . From the top 50 hnRNPM - interacting proteins , we selected 29 splicing factors ( See Methods for details ) and performed a CD44v8 splicing minigene reporter assay ( Supplementary Fig . 1b and Supplemental Data 1 ) . After co - transfecting each of the 29 open - reading frame ( ORFs ) with the CD44v8 minigene reporter to 293FT cells , we analyzed the levels of CD44v8 splicing , depicted by the ratios of inclusion to skip - ping . Several splicing factors showed notable effects , i . e . , greater than twofold upregulation and 2 . 5 - fold downregulation of the ratios ( Fig . 1b ) . Among them , PTBP1 , AKAP8 , and hnRNPF promoted CD44v8 inclusion , and RBM10 , RBMX , and hnRNPR promoted exon skipping . Immunoprecipitation validation showed that , except for PTBP1 , the remaining ﬁ ve splicing factors interact with hnRNPM in an RNA - independent manner , and some of them showed even stronger protein interactions in the absence of RNA ( Fig . 1c ) . Among the ﬁ ve splicing factors , hnRNPF was previously reported to stimulate CD44v8 inclusion and inhibit EMT 37 . By examining the correlation between the above identi ﬁ ed splicing factors and important clinical outcomes , we found that AKAP8 has the most signi ﬁ cant correlation with metastasis and patient survival ( Fig . 1d ) . AKAP8 expression positively correlates with distal metastasis - free survival in a cohort of 327 published breast cancer samples analyzed by microarray 38 . The positive correlation of AKAP8 expression and metastasis - free survival is congruent with our experimental ﬁ ndings that AKAP8 promotes CD44v8 inclusion and inhibits CD44s production , the isoform that promotes EMT and tumor metastasis 8 , 26 , 39 . Further analysis of the METABRIC breast cancer data set showed that AKAP8 expression positively correlates with overall survival ( Fig . 1e ) , most signi ﬁ cantly in Luminal A , Luminal B , and HER2 + subtypes ( Supplementary Fig . 1c – g ) . Analysis of AKAP8 expres - sion levels in different subtypes of breast cancer revealed that AKAP8 expression is highest in the Luminal A subtype , the least aggressive breast cancer subtype that is epithelial in nature , and AKAP8 expression is signi ﬁ cantly lower in the Claudin low and basal subtypes , which are more aggressive and mesenchymal ( Fig . 1f and Supplementary Fig . 1h ) . Similarly , AKAP8 is highly expressed in the ER - positive breast tumors compared with the ER - negative breast tumors ( Supplementary Fig . 1i ) . These results associate AKAP8 with an epithelial phenotype in breast cancer and show that loss of AKAP8 is a characteristic of poor survival , prompting us to explore the mechanistic roles of AKAP8 using in vitro models of EMT and in vivo models of breast cancer metastasis .

The above observations suggest that AKAP8 protects an epithelial state , so we sought to determine whether knockdown of AKAP8 accelerates EMT . We utilized a tamoxifen ( TAM ) - inducible EMT system where human mammary epithelial cells were engineered to ectopically express the transcription factor Twist fused to ER ( HMLE / Twist - ER , Ref . 8 ) . We depleted AKAP8 in HMLE / Twist - ER cells by two independent shRNAs and observed a marked knockdown of the AKAP8 protein ( Fig . 2a , Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) . With TAM induction , both the control and AKAP8 shRNA - expressing cells underwent morphological changes with gradual loss of the cobble - stone - like epithelial clusters and gain of expression of mesenchymal markers ( Fig . 2a , b ) . The AKAP8 shRNA - expressing cells showed a more rapid transition to the mesenchymal phenotype compared to controls . At Day 12 of TAM induction , AKAP8 knockdown cells showed a more drastic reduction of epithelial markers E - cadherin and γ - catenin and a more pronounced increase in the mesenchymal marker N - cadherin ( Fig . 2a ) . Although control cells were still loosely packed as clusters , the AKAP8 knockdown cells were fully transited to c a BioID assay of hnRNPM - interacting proteins Mass Spec analysis to select 29 hnRNPM binding partners CD44v8 minigene screen d Novel SF’s effect on EMT / metastasis b f HNRN P M R B M 10 R B M X HNRN P R K H S R P R B M 6 S F 1 F U BP 1 HNRN PA 2 B 1 I L F 3 Z N F 326 F U BP 3 W DR 33 M A T R 3 HNRN PA 1L2 DD X 5 X RN 2 HNRN P D L SY NCR I P R B M 12 DD X 17 S U G P 2 R B M 12 B R B M 14 HNRN PA 3 R P RD 2 HNRN P F AKAP 8 P T BP 1 – 6 – 4 – 2 0 2 4 Log2 ( CD 44 v 8 I n c l / S k i p ) Flag - hnRNPM RBMX hnRNPF AKAP8 PTBP1 IB No RNase RNase RBM10 hnRNPR 0 90 180 270 360 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 S u r v i v a l p r obab ili t y Time ( month ) LumA CLOW Basal – 6 – 3 0 3 6 N o r m a li z ed AKAP 8 l e v e l P = 1 . 52e – 8 P = 2 . 64e – 13 e 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 0 . 00 0 . 50 1 . 00 Time ( month ) D i s t a l m e t a s t a s i s f r ee s u r v i v a l p r obab ili t y P = 0 . 00059 P < 0 . 0001 AKAP8High ( 815 ) Low ( 943 ) AKAP8High ( 199 ) Low ( 128 ) 75 kDa 100 kDa 75 kDa 50 kDa 50 kDa 100 kDa 50 kDa I npu t I npu t I g G I P I g G I P F l ag I P F l ag I P Fig . 1 Functional screening to identify AKAP8 as an hnRNPM - interacting protein . a A ﬂ ow chart showing the experimental approaches to identify hnRNPM - interacting proteins . b qRT - PCR analysis of the CD44v8 splicing reporter minigene screening for the candidate splicing factors .

These results reveal that AKAP8 knockdown accelerates EMT . To generalize the ﬁ ndings , we examined the effect of AKAP8 knockdown in a different epithelial cell line , HCT116 colon cancer cells , and observed that knockdown of AKAP8 alone is suf ﬁ cient to induce a loss of epithelial char - acteristics , as demonstrated by the gain of elongated spindle - like mesenchymal morphology and the decrease in expression of epithelial markers ( Fig . 2d , e ) . Re - expressing the AKAP8 cDNA in the AKAP8 knockdown cells restored the decreased expression of epithelial markers ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . Together , these results indicate that knockdown of AKAP8 promotes EMT . AKAP8 inhibits breast cancer lung metastasis . As EMT is essential for tumor metastasis , our ﬁ nding that AKAP8 inhibits EMT prompted us to determine whether AKAP8 inhibits breast cancer metastasis . We used a patient - derived xenograft ( PDX ) model HIM3 where the cells were derived from a patient triple - negative breast tumor 40 . HIM3 maintains an epithelial phenotype and expresses high levels of E - cadherin and AKAP8 ( Fig . 3a ) . Consistent with our observations shown in Fig . 2 , knocking down AKAP8 in the HIM3 cells resulted in a decrease in epithelial markers E - cadherin , γ - catenin , and Occludin . To capture the effect of AKAP8 on tumor metastasis , we inoculated NSG mice with 1 × 10 5 control or AKAP8 knockdown cells through tail vein injection and measured the potential of lung metastasis ( Fig . 3b ) . AKAP8 knockdown with two different shRNAs signi ﬁ cantly increased BLI signals compared with control , indicating the enhanced ability of metastatic tumor formation in mice in response to AKAP8 depletion ( Fig . 3c , d ) . Our Hematoxylin and Eosin ( H & E ) analysis support this observation , showing a sig - ni ﬁ cant increase in the area of metastatic nodules in the lungs of mice that were injected with cells expressing AKAP8 shRNAs ( Fig . 3e , f ) . We also noticed that the AKAP8 KD - 2 cells showed greater metastasis ability than the KD - 1 cells , although the KD - 2 shRNA was less potent in promoting the EMT phenotype than the KD - 1 shRNA . This observation could be in support of the growing evidence that cells in a hybrid epithelial / mesenchymal state tend to have a greater advantage in establishing metastatic lesions 41 – 44 . Because the AKAP8 shRNA - expressing HIM3 cells did not show a proliferation advantage compared with control HIM3 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) , these results demonstrate that AKAP8 silencing promotes breast cancer metastasis to the lung . As a complementary approach , we ectopically expressed AKAP8 in a lung metastatic breast cancer cell line LM2 , a derivative of MDA - MB - 231 cells , and examined whether forced expression of AKAP8 inhibits lung metastasis . Tetracycline - induced expression of AKAP8 in LM2 cells promoted the expression of epithelial marker and inhibited the levels of mesenchymal markers ( Supplementary Fig . 3b , c ) . These cells also showed retardation of cell migration in vitro ( Supplementary Fig . 3d , e ) . Interestingly , tail vein injection of the AKAP8 - expressing LM2 cells in mice resulted in a drastic decrease in metastatic nodule formation as indicated by the luminescent signals and the H & E stains of lung sections ( Fig . 3g - j ) .

AKAP8 antagonizes the splicing activity of hnRNPM . Having established the function of AKAP8 in inhibiting tumor metas - tasis , we next sought to determine its underlying mechanisms . As hnRNPM promotes EMT and breast cancer metastasis by sti - mulating CD44 exon skipping 10 , we hypothesized that AKAP8 antagonizes the splicing activity of hnRNPM . To test this , we co - transfected the CD44v8 splicing minigene construct ( Supple - mentary Fig . 1b ) that contains CD44 variable exon 8 ﬂ anked by introns and two constitutive exons with the AKAP8 cDNA into 293FT cells . We found that AKAP8 promotes exon inclusion of the v8 exon in a dose - dependent manner ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) and that the effect of hnRNPM on inhibiting CD44v8 exon inclusion was dampened in the presence of AKAP8 ( Fig . 4a and supplementary Fig . 4b ) . These results suggest that AKAP8 antagonizes hnRNPM ’ s activity and were recapitulated using another splicing minigene reporter that contains the CD44 vari - able exon 5 ( Fig . 4b , c and Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . We further found that , when AKAP8 is silenced , hnRNPM elicited a more drastic effect on exon skipping in both CD44v8 and CD44v5 minigenes ( Figs . 4d , e , Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . Conversely , siRNA - mediated silencing of hnRNPM showed a moderate but not signi ﬁ cant increase of the AKAP8 ’ s splicing activity ( Sup - plementary Fig . 4e , f ) . Taken together , these data indicate that AKAP8 abrogates hnRNPM ’ s activity on exon skipping . a b E - cadherin γ - catenin Occludin AKAP8 shAKAP8 C t r l K D - 1 K D - 2 HIM3 Weeks after injection e Weeks after injection 0 1 2 3 4 C t r l AKAP 8 O E d 0 1 8 12 100 300 500 2e4 c g h i 3e3 6e4 30 600 f 0 1 2 3 4 0 100 200 300 400 500 CtrlAKAP8 OE * * * Weeks after injection N o r m a li z ed B L I s i gna l s Weeks after injection N o r m a li z ed B L I s i gna l s * * * * * * * Tail vein injectionHIM3 or LM2 cells Ctrl AKAP8 KD - 1 AKAP8 KD - 2 0 5 7 9 11 0 100 200 300 * * * Ctrl AKAP8KD - 1 AKAP8KD - 2 L ung m e t a s t a t i c a r ea ( mm 2 ) Lung m e t a s t a t i c a r ea ( mm 2 ) 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 0 AKAP 8 K D - 1 AKAP 8 K D - 2 C t r l AKAP8KD - 1 AKAP8KD - 2 Ctrl AKAP8 OE Ctrl j Ctrl AKAP8 OE 0 20 40 60 80 * * n = 7 n = 8 β - actin 100 kDa 100 kDa 150 kDa 50 kDa 50 kDa Fig . 3 AKAP8 suppresses breast cancer metastasis . a Western blot analysis showing the decreased expression of epithelial markers , E - cadherin , γ - catenin , and Occludin in HIM3 cells expressing control shRNA ( Ctrl ) and AKAP8 shRNAs ( KD - 1 , KD - 2 ) . b Schematic of a xenograft model to measure breast cancer metastasis using the HIM3 PDX cells and the LM2 breasts cancer metastatic cells . c – f Tail vein injection of the HIM3 PDX tumor cells showing that silencing AKAP8 promotes metastatic tumor growth .

Thus , we examined whether AKAP8 precludes hnRNPM from binding to its intronic consensus sequences by RNA pull - down assay ( Fig . 4f , g ) . We used two sets of RNA oligos , I - 5 and I - 8 , that contained hnRNPM - binding motifs in the introns downstream of the v5 and v8 exons , respectively . Interestingly , the binding signal of hnRNPM to both I - 5 and I - 8 RNA oligos was enhanced in AKAP8 knockdown epithelial cells ( compare lane 4 to lane 3 in Figs . 4f , g , left panels ) , whereas remained the same in AKAP8 knockdown mesenchymal cells ( Fig . 4f , g , right panels ) . These results suggest that AKAP8 diminishes the ability of hnRNPM to bind to its RNA targets in an epithelial cell state - speci ﬁ c manner . Surveying the expression level and localization of AKAP8 and hnRNPM in the context of EMT showed no obvious differences between epithelial and mesenchymal cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4g , h ) , suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved in contributing to this epithelial cell state - speci ﬁ c activity . These possibilities could include post - translational modi ﬁ cation of AKAP8 and / or hnRNPM , changes in levels of other hnRNPM - binding partners identi ﬁ ed in Fig . 1 , and changes in expression of the previously reported splicing regulator ESRP1 , which serves as an antagonist of hnRNPM ’ s splicing activity 9 , 10 . AKAP8 promotes epithelial state - associated alternative splicing . AKAP8 was only recently reported as an RNA - binding protein capable of binding to and regulating alternative splicing 45 . Given our observation that AKAP8 interacts with hnRNPM and reg - ulates CD44 minigene splicing , we sought to interrogate whether AKAP8 regulates global alternative splicing , especially EMT - related alternative splicing . Thus , we performed deep RNA sequencing using the HMLE / Twist - ER cell lines that express control or AKAP8 shRNA in both epithelial and mesenchymal states . We identi ﬁ ed AKAP8 - regulated splicing alterations total - ing 144 and 228 alternative splicing events in epithelial ( Fig . 5a , top panel ) and mesenchymal states ( Fig . 5a , bottom panel ) , respectively ( FDR < 0 . 05 , | Δ PSI | ≥ 0 . 1 , average junction reads per cassette event ≥ 20 ) .

NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14304 - 1 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 486 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14304 - 1 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 7 cassette skipped exon ( SE ) events , the most common form of alternative splicing ( Fig . 5b , c ) . Note that the gene expression levels of these AKAP8 - mediated splicing events were not altered in response to AKAP8 knockdown in either the epithelial or mesenchymal state ( Supplementary Fig . 5a , b ) . As SEs represent the vast majority of AKAP8 - regulated alternative splicing events , we next overlapped AKAP8 - regulated SEs with those regulated during EMT . The latter were obtained from the differential splicing events in control HMLE / Twist - ER cells that are in either the epithelial state or the mesenchymal state . Our results revealed that more than half of AKAP8 - regulated SEs in epithelial cells are also altered during EMT ( 58 overlapping events out of 104 AKAP8 - regulated SEs ) . Remarkably , the vast majority ( 96 . 6 % ) of the 58 common events are regulated in a discordant direction , indicating that AKAP8 antagonizes EMT - associated alternative splicing ( Fig . 5d , left panel ) . This inverse direction of regulation by AKAP8 is unique to the epithelial state . In mesenchymal cells , 52 out of the 151 AKAP8 - regulated events overlapped with the SEs that are altered during EMT . However , they showed roughly equal concordant ( 46 . 2 % ) and discordant ( 53 . 8 % ) directions compared with EMT - associated SEs ( Fig . 5d , right panel ) . The fraction of discordantly regulated events in the epithelial state is signi ﬁ cantly higher than that in the mesenchymal state ( Fig . 5e , P < 0 . 0001 by Fisher ’ s exact test ) . These data show that AKAP8 strongly suppresses EMT - associated alternative splicing in a manner that is epithelial state - speci ﬁ c . This dichotomy is supported by the fact that only 10 SEs were found to be regulated by AKAP8 in both the epithelial and mesenchymal states ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . These 10 overlapping events are all regulated in the same direction ( Supplementary Fig . 5d ) . Interestingly , 7 out of the 10 events overlapped with the EMT - associated SEs and all showed discordant regulation with the EMT - associated SEs ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 5e ) . These results imply that AKAP8 antagonizes a set of EMT - associated SEs in both cell states . Experimental RT - PCR validation of SEs that are regulated by AKAP8 knockdown and during EMT showed that AKAP8 knockdown - mediated splicing alterations are consistent with the direction of splicing changes during EMT ( Supplementary Fig . 5f ) . Further supporting the role of AKAP8 in inhibiting EMT came from Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( GSEA ) . Comparing the transcriptome of control and AKAP8 knockdown cells , we found that genes that are upregulated during EMT show increased expression upon AKAP8 knockdown in the epithelial state , whereas genes that are downregulated during EMT show decreased expression in the AKAP8 - silenced mesenchymal cells ( Fig . 5f ) . Together , these results show that AKAP8 antagonizes EMT - associated alternative splicing across the transcriptome to maintain an epithelial cell state . AKAP8 binds to RNA with a consensus motif . To identify high - con ﬁ dence binding sites for AKAP8 across the transcriptome , we performed single - nucleotide resolution enhanced cross - linking and immunoprecipitation ( eCLIP ) . Two AKAP8 eCLIP biological replicates were performed in each of the epithelial and mesenchymal cell states and showed a high degree of correlation , highlighting the reproducibility of our assay ( Supplementary Fig . 6a , b ) . By normalizing IP signal with size - matched input eCLIP libraries , we obtained quantitative estimates of AKAP8 - binding intensity , resulting in 21 , 665 and 26 , 228 high - con ﬁ dence AKAP8 - binding sites in the epithelial and mesenchymal state , respectively ( log2FC ( IP / Input ) ≥ 2 per replicate , − log ( adjusted P value ) ≥ 3 , per replicate ) . Mapping the location of AKAP8 - binding sites across the gene body revealed that the majority of binding sites are located in distal introns > 500 nucleotides from splice sites ( Fig . 6a ) . Interestingly , although AKAP8 showed less binding to distal introns in the epithelial state compared with the mesenchymal state ( Fig . 6b , P = 9 . 38e − 174 by Fisher ’ s exact test ) , it binds to proximal intronic regions more signi ﬁ cantly in the epithelial state ( Fig . 6b , P = 6 . 60e − 116 by Fisher ’ s exact test ) . These results suggest that AKAP8 regulates alternative splicing more directly in epithelial states through binding to pre - mRNA proximal intron regions . Differences in binding to other gene regions in the 5 ′ and 3 ′ - UTR or the coding region showed no statistical differences ( Fig . 6b ) . Metagene analysis to assess AKAP8 - binding intensity across all human introns and exons revealed signi ﬁ cantly more frequent binding of AKAP8 to introns compared with exons ( Fig . 6c ) . Interestingly , AKAP8 intronic binding in the epithelial state appears skewed towards the 5 ’ splice site while binding in the mesenchymal state is distributed more evenly across the intron ( Fig . 6c , compare top and bottom plots in left panel ) . Quanti ﬁ cation of the binding ability in the proximal introns revealed signi ﬁ cantly higher binding in the epithelial state ( Fig . 6d ) , reinforcing our observations that AKAP8 binds more frequently ( Fig . 6b ) and more strongly ( Fig . 6c ) to proximal intronic regions in the epithelial state . Using the single - nucleotide precision of eCLIP , we identi ﬁ ed AKAP8 high ﬁ delity binding motifs . We took the center of each AKAP8 - binding interval and extended the length 100 nucleotides upstream and downstream of each center . The AKAP8 - binding motifs contain guanine stretches of at least three nucleotides ﬂ anked by one or two uridine or adenine nucleotides ( Fig . 6e ) , and AKAP8 shares very similar recognition motifs in epithelial and mesenchymal states . We identi ﬁ ed 16 and 20 SEs that are both bound by AKAP8 within 1000 bp of the variable exon and regulated by AKAP8 in epithelial and mesenchymal cell states , respectively ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . We did not observe a relationship between AKAP8 - binding topology and direction of SE regulation . Screening the AKAP8 - binding peaks near the CD44v8 exon indicated one signi ﬁ cant peak located upstream of the v8 exon containing two AKAP8 motifs with guanine stretches ﬂ anked by adenine ( Supplementary Fig . 6c ) . AKAP8 ’ s binding was validated by RNA pull - down assay with an RNA oligo , AK , which was derived from the core of this peak ( Supplementary Fig . 6d ) . The most enriched AKAP8 - binding site is located at the upstream proximal intron of CLSTN1 variable exon 11 containing four AKAP8 motifs . AKAP8 binds in both epithelial and mesenchymal states but with a greater than twofold binding intensity in the epithelial state ( Fig . 6f ) . Because CLSTN1 exon 11 inclusion increased during EMT and in AKAP8 knockdown epithelial cells , these results suggest that AKAP8 binds to CLSTN1 and inhibits EMT - mediated CLSTN1 exon inclusion , a regulatory axis which may block EMT . Depletion of the CLSTN1 short isoform promotes EMT . To experimentally test the role of AKAP8 - mediated CLSTN1 splicing during EMT , we examined the binding of AKAP8 to the above eCLIP - predicted CLSTN1 - binding motifs by RNA pull - down experiments . We found that AKAP8 binds to the consensus sequences in both 293FT cells and HMLE / Twist - ER cells ( Fig . 7a , bottom panel ) , but not the mutated sequences ( Fig . 7a ) . CLSTN1 is a member of the calsyntenin family and was reported to function in cargo traf ﬁ cking along neuronal axons . Thus far , the role of CLSTN1 or its isoforms in EMT has not been reported . We designed isoform - speci ﬁ c shRNAs to silence either the CLSTN1 - L or CLSTN1 - S individually ( Fig . 7b , top panel ) and achieved speci ﬁ c isoform knockdowns without showing decreased ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14304 - 1 8 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 486 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14304 - 1 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications expression of the non - targeted isoforms ( Fig . 7b , bottom panel ) . TAM induction of EMT in the HMLE / Twist - ER control and CLSTN1 - S shRNA - expressing cells showed that silencing CLSTN1 - S - accelerated EMT signi ﬁ cantly within 8 days ( Fig . 7c ) . These cells also switched expression from epithelial markers to mesenchymal markers ( Fig . 7d ) and displayed loss of E - cadherin at the cell junctions ( Fig . 7e ) . By contrast , control cells at this stage were largely maintained in the epithelial state ( Fig . 7c – e ) . These results reveal that silencing CLSTN1 - S promotes EMT . Although silencing CLSTN1 - L did not show an overt difference compared with control cells , it caused signi ﬁ cant cell death after the TAM induction for 4 days ( Supplementary Fig . 7a ) , implying that CLSTN1 - L is required for cell survival during EMT .

We then analyzed the levels of CLSTN1 isoforms using the TCGA breast cancer patient RNA - sequencing data , and found that higher fractions of CLSTN1 - L , represented by high PSI values , were associated with higher levels of the mesenchymal marker vimentin in patient breast tumors , especially in luminal breast cancer ( Fig . 7f and Supplementary Fig . 7c ) , These CLSTN1 - L high patients also showed worse survival compared with those patients with lower levels of CLSTN1 - L ( Fig . 7g ) . Interestingly however , CLSTN1 expression did not correlate with patient survival ( Supplementary Fig . 7d ) . These results show that CLSTN1 alternative splicing , rather than its gene expression , is signi ﬁ cantly associated with breast cancer patient survival .

It was later reported to function as a DNA - binding protein 50 as well as an RNA - binding protein that in ﬂ u - ences RNA stability and pre - mRNA splicing 45 , 51 , 52 . Our study provides a functional role for AKAP8 in RNA metabolism and connected it further to a tumor metastasis suppression pheno - type . We show that AKAP8 is capable of inhibiting the splicing activity of hnRNPM , perturbing hnRNPM - mediated alternative splicing that occurs during EMT . AKAP8 is able to bind its own RNA consensus sequences and prevent the EMT - associated alternative splicing . Functionally , AKAP8 inhibits EMT and breast cancer metastasis to the lung . High levels of AKAP8 expression predicts a better survival of breast cancer patients . Thus , these results nominate AKAP8 as a splicing regulator for EMT - associated alternative splicing and for inhibition of EMT and tumor metastasis , highlighting the importance of RNA - binding protein in regulating cancer progression . The identi ﬁ cation of AKAP8 in suppressing EMT and cancer metastasis was through a biochemical approach to capture pro - teins that interact with hnRNPM , previously shown to promote EMT and tumor metastasis by regulating alternative splicing of CD44 . AKAP8 interacts with hnRNPM and antagonizes hnRNPM ’ s splicing activity on CD44 exon skipping . One inter - esting observation was that the AKAP8 - hnRNPM interaction became stronger upon RNase treatment , which led us to speculate that AKAP8 binding to hnRNPM blocks hnRNPM from binding to its RNA targets . Supporting this view , depletion of AKAP8 promoted hnRNPM ’ s ability to bind its consensus RNA sequences and to stimulate exon skipping . Previous character - ization of AKAP8 showed that the N - terminal region of AKAP8 mediates its protein interactions with other splicing factors , such as hnRNPM 45 . The C - terminal domain of AKAP8 mediates pre - mRNA binding through two zinc ﬁ nger domains . These results are congruent with our ﬁ ndings that AKAP8 interacts with hnRNPM , which in turn , inhibits hnRNPM - mediated splicing . AKAP8 is also capable of binding RNA and directly regulates alternative splicing . As both AKAP8 and hnRNPM share some - what similar but not completely overlapping binding motifs , it is likely that they compete on binding to a subset of RNAs . Notably , the opposite splicing regulatory roles of AKAP8 and hnRNPM in co - regulation of EMT - associated splicing events provides increasing evidence that the complex interplay among RNA - binding proteins tightly controls alternative splicing 9 . Functionally , we used both a PDX model of tumor metastasis and a highly metastatic cell line LM2 and showed that AKAP8 knockdown promotes breast cancer lung metastasis and ectopic expression of AKAP8 inhibits metastasis . These results comple - ment our previous ﬁ ndings showing that depletion of the CD44s splice isoform inhibits breast cancer metastasis . In this study , we have provided evidence on the role of AKAP8 in suppressing metastasis using immune - compromised mice . As tumor micro - environment plays important roles in both inhibiting and pro - moting tumor metastasis , future validation of these results in immune - competent mice will be needed to better understand the role of the RNA metabolism in metastasis . Our transcriptome - wide RNA - sequencing analysis demon - strated that AKAP8 regulates alternative splicing with pre - dominant regulation of SEs . Most of the AKAP8 - regulated alternative splicing events in the epithelial state show opposite directions of splicing regulation compared with those occurring during EMT , suggesting a functional role of AKAP8 in antag - onizing EMT - associated alternative splicing . In addition to AKAP8 , there are a handful of RNA - binding proteins that have been functionally implicated during EMT , including hnRNPM , ESRP1 , RBFOX2 , QKI 9 , 10 , 29 , 32 , 53 – 56 . In the AKAP8 knockdown cells , we did not identify any drastic changes in expression of these RNA - binding proteins , suggesting again that AKAP8 has a direct role in regulating alternative splicing , resulting in inhibition of EMT . The eCLIP analysis of AKAP8 binding revealed the binding sites of AKAP8 across the transcriptome . AKAP8 preferentially binds to introns and less frequently binds to the coding regions or 5 ′ - or 3 ′ - UTRs . Our eCLIP results resolved a short 5 – 6 - mer consensus motif consisting of guanine stretches of at least three nucleotides long preferentially ﬂ anked by adenine or uridine nucleotides . The top motifs were many orders of magnitude more signi ﬁ cant than secondary motifs identi ﬁ ed by the de novo motif analysis pipeline and were consistent in both epithelial and mesenchymal cells , suggesting that AKAP8 binds a similar motif regardless of cell state and that our motif analysis method is reproducible . A previous study 45 reported an AKAP8 motif through de novo motif analysis , where three relatively disparate sequences of 12 - mer motifs were obtained . Although these motifs are longer than the ones we report , our ﬁ ndings are somewhat consistent with an AGGAGGA sequence identi ﬁ ed in one of the motifs in that study . This commonality notwithstanding , we speculate that the motifs derived from our study resolved a more precise AKAP8 motif with a higher level of statistical signi ﬁ cance provided by the single - nucleotide resolution of the eCLIP meth - odology and the integration of input normalization into our AKAP8 - binding site calling compared with the less - precise RIP - seq method used in the aforementioned study . Furthermore , we resolved the motifs using a background control of shuf ﬂ ed human introns , the gene region AKAP8 binds the most abundantly . We have experimentally characterized one of the newly iden - ti ﬁ ed AKAP8 splicing targets , CLSTN1 . CLSTN1 is a trans - membrane protein and belongs to the calsyntenin family , a subset of the cadherin superfamily 57 . CLSTN1 was found mainly par - ticipating in neural axon traf ﬁ cking and branching as well as acting as a mediator of virus replication 58 – 60 . This study made an unexpected functional connection between CLSTN1 alternative splicing and EMT . We showed that silencing of the CLSTN1 - S isoform , a product of AKAP8 - regulated splicing , accelerates EMT , suggesting that the CLSTN1 - S splice isoform is critical for maintaining an epithelial state . By contrast , knockdown of the CLSTN1 - L isoform resulted in cell death , suggesting a necessity of this isoform for cells to undergo EMT . Furthermore , as the CLSTN1 splice isoform levels , but not its transcription level , correlates with patient survival , we speculate that tipping the AKAP8 downstream target from CLSTN1 - L to CLSTN1 - S may be an effective strategy for the treatment of breast cancer . Future studies on the role of CLSTN1 splice isoforms in breast cancer metastasis will be necessary to determine whether this splice isoform switch is functionally important for metastasis , as we previously uncovered for the CD44 splice isoform switch 8 , 26 . In conclusion , this work has led to the identi ﬁ cation of a new role of the RNA - binding protein AKAP8 in suppressing EMT and breast cancer metastasis . We demonstrated that the CLSTN1 - S splice isoform , generated by AKAP8 - mediated alternative spli - cing , inhibits EMT and shows an inverse correlation with breast cancer progression . Our results reveal the complex regulation of alternative splicing by RNA - binding proteins in cancer and suggest the power of studying alternative splicing to uncover a new layer that regulates tumor metastasis .

BioID pull down assay and mass spectrometry analysis . A full - length hnRNPM cDNA was cloned into pQCXIP - BirA ( R118G ) - HA at Not1 and BamH1 site to express an hnRNPM - BirA - HA fusion protein . An hnRNPM - BirA - HA expressing stable cell line was generated in 293FT cells . BioID pull - down experiments were performed according to a previously published method 61 . To describe , cells in a 15cm dish were pretreated with 50 μ M biotin 24hours prior to the collection . Cells were washed three times with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and scraped directly in 900 μ l lysis buffer ( 50mM Tris - HCl , 500mM NaCl , 0 . 2 % PBS , 1mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , fresh added protease inhibitors ) and a ﬁ nal concentration of 2 % Triton X - 100 was added , followed by sonication . After diluting the lysates with an equal amount of pre - chilled 50mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , a second round of sonication was performed . The lysates were centrifuged and the supernatant was incubated with 150 μ l strep - tavidin beads at 4°C overnight by rotation . After incubation , the beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice in buffer 1 ( 2 % SDS ) ; twice in buffer 2 ( 0 . 1 % deoxycholic acid , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1mM EDTA , 500mM NaCl , 50mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 ) ; twice in buffer 3 ( 0 . 5 % deoxycholic acid , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 1mM EDTA , 250mM LiCl , 10mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 ) ; twice in buffer 4 ( 2M urea , 10mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 ) . The proteins were eluted in 90 μ l elution buffer ( 2× SDS sample buffer supplemented with 20mM DTT and 2mM biotin ) by boiling for 10min . 10 % of the samples were analyzed by silver stain and 90 % were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis at the Harvard Taplin Mass Spectrometry Facility . Plasmids and shRNAs . Twenty - nine ORFs of splicing factors were obtained as ORF entry clones . They were then cloned into a pLenti6 . 3 V5 / Dest vector to generate the destination clones by the gateway LR reaction ( Invitrogen , USA ) . The 29 splicing factors were selected based on the rank of the unique peptide reads of Mass Spec and the availability of the clones in our cDNA library 62 , 63 . All plasmid constructs were validated by DNA sequencing . The AKAP8 cDNA were cloned into PCDH - CMV - MCS - EF1 - Puro between XbaI and BamHI sites with a Flag - tag fused at the C - terminal and were used in the CD44v8 splicing minigene assay . The AKAP8 cDNA was also cloned into a DOX - inducible plasmid pCW57 - GFP - 2A - MCS between MluI and BamHI sites and were used for over - expression in LM2 cells in the in vivo metastasis assay . For AKAP8 reexpression in the AKAP8 KD HCT116 cells , three synonymous mutations were introduced to AKAP8 shRNA - 1 targeting site ( wt : GCCAAGATCAACCAGCGTTTG , mut : GCCAAGATTAATCAACGTTTG ) , by Q5 Site - Directed Mutagenesis kit ( NEB , E0554S ) . All shRNAs were design using the ranidesigner program at Life Tech - nologies and isoform - speci ﬁ c shRNAs were designed according to the described principles 64 . ShRNAs were cloned into pLKO . 1 vector . All shRNA sequences were listed in Supplementary Table 1 . Immunoblotting assay . Cells growing in tissue culture dishes were washed twice with cold PBS and collected in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 % SDS , 1 mM EDTA , 1mM NaF , 1mM Na3VO4 , 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail ) . After incubating on ice for 15 min , lysates were clari ﬁ ed by centrifuge at 12 , 000 rpm for 10min , 4 °C . Protein concentrations were quanti ﬁ ed by bradford protein assay ( Bio - Rad , Catalog no . 500 - 0006 ) and boiled in ﬁ nal concentration of 1 × sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer . Equal amounts of protein were subjected to electrophoresis and transferred to methanol activated PVDF membrane ( Millipore , # IPVH00010 ) . Membranes were blocked in 5 % non - fat milk in TBST ( Tris - HCl buffer , pH 7 . 4 , supplemented with 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) for 1hour at room temperature and followed by primary antibody incubation overnight at 4°C . Antibodies used in this study and their dilutions were listed at respective dilutions : Flag ( Sigma , F1804 , 1 : 2000 ) , RBM10 ( One World Lab , 1 : 1000 ) , hnRNPR ( One World Lab , 1 : 1000 ) , RBMX ( Cell signaling , 14794 , 1 : 1000 ) , hnRNPF ( Santa Cruz , sc - 390048 , 1 : 200 ) , AKAP8 ( Abcam , ab72196 , 1 : 500 ) , PTBP1 ( One World Lab , 1 : 1000 ) , E - cadherin ( Cell Signaling , 3195 , 1 : 1000 ) , γ - catenin ( Cell Signaling , 2309 , 1 : 1000 ) , Occludin ( Abcam , ab168986 , 1 : 500 ) , FN1 ( BD , 610077 , 1 : 2000 ) , N - cadherin ( BD , 610920 , 1 : 1000 ) , hnRNPM ( Origene technologies , TA301557 , 1 : 50 , 000 ) , GAPDH ( EMD Millipore , MAB374 , 1 : 10000 ) , β - actin ( Sigma , A5441 , 1 : 10000 ) . Then , membranes were washed with TBST for three times , 5min each and incubated at corre - sponding HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature . After four times washing with TBST , the targeted bands were developed with ECL ( ThermoFisher , PI32106 ) and detected either with ﬁ lm or ChemiDoc Imaging Systems . All uncropped scans were provided in the Source Data ﬁ le . CD44 splicing minigene assay . CD44 splicing minigene assay were carried out in 293FT cells . In all , 2 . 25× 10 5 cells were plated in each well of a 24 - well plate 24 hours prior to transfection , and were co - transfected with RNA - binding protein plasmids and CD44v8 or CD44v5 - splicing minigene reporter using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) . Cells were collected 24 hours after transfection for RNA extraction ( Omega Bio - Tek ) and reverse transcription , followed by qRT - PCR or semi - qPCR to examine spliced isoforms . For qRT - PCR analysis of splicing , isoform - speci ﬁ c primers were used to detect the inclusion and skipping isoforms , respectively . The ratio of the inclusion to skipping was calculated and compared . Because PCR from two primer sets can give rise to different ampli ﬁ cation ef ﬁ - ciency , we avoid taking the sum of the values of two PCR products as a denominator for calculating the percent spliced in ( PSI ) . For semi - qPCR experi - ments , a same set of primers was used to amplify both the inclusion and skipping products , which were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis . Immunoprecipitation assay . 293FT cells overexpressing Flag - hnRNPM - HA were lysed in CoIP lysis buffer ( 20mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 137mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 1 % NP - 40 , 2 mM EDTA , 20 mM NaF , 1mM NaVO3 , and 20mM β - glycerophosphate with fresh PI added ) . After centrifugation , lysate protein con - centration was quanti ﬁ ed . The lysate was pre - cleared with sepharose beads and incubated with corresponding antibodies at 4°C overnight with rotation . Next day , protein A beads were added to capture the antibody – protein complexes and rotated at 4°C for 3 hours . Beads were washed with lysis buffer for three times , followed by protein elution in 2× sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer and boiled for 10min . Samples were analyzed by western blot for testing IP ef ﬁ ciency and interacting proteins with corresponding antibodies . RNA pull - down assay . RNA oligonucleotides labeled with biotin at the 5 ’ - end were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies . The RNA sequences used in this study were listed in the following , I - 8 : GCUUUGGUGGUGGAAUGGUGCUAUGUGG , I - 5 : UGGCGGUCGGCAGUUCUGGGUUAGAUGA , AK : GGUUGGUAAGGGGG AGG GGAUAAAAUGGUG , NC : GCUUUGAUGAUGAAAUGA , CI10 - WT : AGA AGCCU GGGGUUGGGGGUGGUAAAGU , CI10 - MUT : AGAAGCCUGCGCUUG CGCGUGG UAAAGU . In all , 400pmol Biotinylated RNA oligos were conjugated with 50 μ l of streptavidin beads ( 50 % slurry ; ThermoFisher ) in a total volume of 300 μ l of RNA - binding buffer ( 20mM Tris , 200mM NaCl , 6mM EDTA , 5mM sodium ﬂ uoride and 5mM β - glycerophosphate , PH 7 . 5 ) at 4°C in a rotating shaker for 2 hours . After three times wash with RNA - binding buffer , RNA - beads conjugates were incubated with 100 μ g of nuclear extracts in 500 μ l RNA - binding buffer at 4°C in a rotating shaker overnight . Beads were then washed with RNA - binding buffer for three times and the RNA pull - down samples were eluted with 2× SDS loading buffer for western blot analysis . Immuno ﬂ uorescence assay . Cells plated on coverslips were ﬁ xed with 4 % par - aformaldehyde in PBS for 10min at room temperature , followed by permeabili - zation with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min . Cells were blocked with 1 % BSA in PBS and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C ( 1 : 100 dilution for E - cadherin , 1 : 100 for AKAP8 , and 1 : 500 for hnRNPM ) . After three times wash with PBS , secondary goat anti - rabbit AlexaFluor 488 or goat anti - mouse AlexaFluor 568 ( ThermoFisher , 1 : 500 dilution ) were added for 1h incubation at room tempera - ture . After four times wash with PBS , coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold anti - fade ( ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . Images were captured on Zeiss LSM 880 Confocal Microscope for E - cadherin using × 40 oil objective and Echo Revolve Microscope for AKAP8 and hnRNPM using × 20 objective . RNA - sequencing and data analysis . Three biological replicates for control HMLE / Twist - ER with and without TAM treatment , three biological replicates for AKAP8 knockdown HMLE / Twist - ER without TAM treatment , and two biological replicates for AKAP8 knockdown HMLE / Twist - ER with TAM treatment cells were collected in 1 ml TRIzol for a 10cm dish . RNAs were extracted followed by the TRIzol Reagent kit from Invitrogen . The puri ﬁ ed RNAs were submitted to Genomic Facility at University of Chicago for RNA quality validation , poly ( A ) selected RNA - seq library generation and paired - end sequencing on a HiSeq 4000 . RNA - seq reads were aligned to the human genome ( GRCh37 , primary assembly ) and transcriptome ( Gencode version 24 backmap 37 comprehensive gene anno - tation ) using STAR version 2 . 6 . 1a 65 with the following non - standard parameters – outFilterMultimapNmax 1 – outSAMstrandField intronMotif – outFilterType BySJout – alignSJoverhangMin 8 – alignSJDBoverhangMin 3 – alignEndsType EndToEnd . Only uniquely aligned reads were retained for downstream analysis . Differential alternative splicing was quanti ﬁ ed using rMATS version 4 . 0 . 2 66 with the following non - default parameters – readLength 100 – cstat 0 . 01 – libType fr - secondstrand . To identify signi ﬁ cant differential splicing events , we set up the following cutoffs : FDR < 0 . 05 , Δ PSI ≥ 0 . 1 , and average junction reads per event per replicate ≥ 20 . Differential gene expression analysis was performed by counting reads over genes from the same annotation as alignment using featureCounts version 1 . 5 . 0 with the following non - default parameters - s 2 - p - C - B . Differential gene expression analysis was conducted using DESeq2 performed on genes with read abundance larger than 10 counts over the smallest library size of all samples analyzed 67 . Signi ﬁ cantly regulated genes were de ﬁ ned as genes with an | log2FC | > 1 and FDR < 0 . 05 . GSEA was conducted using the GSEA pre - rank method where differentially expressed genes were ranked by log2FC before conducting GSEA analysis using gene set level permutation 10000 times 68 , 69 . eCLIP assay and data analysis . AKAP8 single - end eCLIP was performed in HMLE / Twist - ER cells without or with TAM treatment . Experiments were done in two biological replicates , following the protocol previously published 70 .

Protein - RNA complexes between 95 kDa and 180 kDa were collected for RNA isolation followed by library generation . eCLIP libraries were sent to Genomic Facility at University of Chicago for single - end sequencing . eCLIP data processing was conducted using the public eCLIP pipeline version 0 . 2 . 1a ( https : / / github . com / YeoLab / eclip / releases / tag / 0 . 2 . 1a ) and public merge - peaks pipeline version 0 . 0 . 6 ( https : / / github . com / YeoLab / merge _ peaks / releases / tag / 0 . 0 . 6 ) , derived from the previously published eCLIP pipeline 70 . High - con ﬁ dence eCLIP peaks for each cell state were called by selecting AKAP8 - binding peaks with a minimum log2FC IP / Input signal > 2 among the replicates and an adjusted p value < 0 . 001 , resulting in 21 , 668 and 26 , 230 AKAP8 - binding peaks in the epithelial and mesenchymal states , respectively . These were the peaks used for downstream analysis . De novo motif analysis was conducted by extending 100 nt on either side of the center of the peaks using HOMER v4 . 10 ﬁ ndMotifsGenome . pl script with the following non - default parameters - p 4 - rna - S 10 - len 4 , 5 , 6 - size 100 - chopify . De novo motifs were computed compared to a background of shuf ﬂ ed human introns . Metagenes and other analyses were computed using custom R and python scripts . In vivo metastasis assay . All animal procedures were performed with approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Baylor College of Medicine . In total , 1× 10 5 HIM3 control and AKAP8 knockdown cells or 2× 10 5 LM2 control and AKAP8 OE cells were injected into 6 – 8 weeks old NSG nude mice by tail vein . Cell amount injected was quanti ﬁ ed by D - luciferin injection and IVIS spectrum imaging ( Caliper LifeScience ) , immediately after the injection as a reference signal . For the LM2 cells with tet - ON AKAP8 overexpression , mice were fed with DOX water ( 2 mg ml − 1 ) at all time through the experiment . The lung metastasis BLI signals were monitored every week till the tumor burdens were intolerable . Mice were euthanized and lungs were collected by 4 % paraformalde - hyde perfusion , followed by ﬁ xation and H & E staining to analyze the metastasis nodules . The areas of lung metastases were quanti ﬁ ed by image J . Cell proliferation and wound healing assay . For cell proliferation assay , 15 , 000 HIM3 control and AKAP8 knockdown cells were plated into a well of 96 well plates . Six hours later , cells were attached to the bottom , and the plates were loaded into the IncuCyte Zoom Live - content imaging system ( Essen Bioscience ) . The cell con ﬂ uences were scanned every 8 hours for a 4 - day duration . Cell con ﬂ uences were calculated for proliferation curve analysis . For wound healing assay , 1 ×10 6 LM2 control or AKAP8 OE cells were seeded in each well of a six - well plate . In all , 24 hours later , a scratch was created in each well with a 200 µl tip and ﬂ oated cells were washed way with PBS , and medium was refreshed into Dulbecco ' s Modi ﬁ ed Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) without serum . The plates were placed into the IncuCyte Zoom Live - content imaging system for scanning at a 4hour interval for 24hours to collect scratch images . Percentage of wound healed was quanti ﬁ ed by Image J . Patient data analysis . AKAP8 expression levels downloaded from METABRIC database were Z score transformed and compared in different breast cancer sub - types , including Luminal A ( LumA ) , Luminal B ( LumB ) , HER2 , Claudin low ( CLOW ) , Basal , ER positive ( ER + ) and ER negative ( ER − ) . AKAP8 expression correlation with breast cancer patient overall survival was separated by AKAP8 mean expression ( n = 1758 ) from the METABRIC data set . The correlation between AKAP8 expression level and the distal metastasis - free survival was cal - culated using microarray data from a breast cancer cohort ( GSE20685 , n = 327 ) , by setting online Kaplan – Meier plotter tool for optimal cutoff for separation of patients into high - and low - gene expression groups 38 , 71 . To examine the correlation between CLSTN1 splice isoform expression and breast cancer patient survival outcome , CLSTN1 exon 11 PSI values in patient samples were calculated according to previous analysis 9 . Kaplan – Meier survival analysis was conducted between the high PSI and low PSI groups , de ﬁ ned by k - means clustering ( k = 2 ) , using overall survival . P values were computed using log - rank tests . CLSTN1 gene expression correlation with patient survival was calculated within the same patient cohort using k - means clustering ( k = 2 ) . Statistical analyses . All data were presented as mean± standard deviation , unless speci ﬁ cally indicated . Statistical signi ﬁ cance was determined by two - tailed Stu - dent ’ s t test , unless speci ﬁ cally indicated . P value < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant . P < 0 . 05 ( * ) , P < 0 . 01 ( * * ) , P < 0 . 001 ( * * * ) were indicated . Reporting summary .
