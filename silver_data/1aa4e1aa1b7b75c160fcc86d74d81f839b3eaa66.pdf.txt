Schmidt † Department of Physics and Astronomy , Vrije Universiteit , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ( Received 15 July 2005 ; published 7 April 2006 ) We measure the linear viscoelasticity of sterically entangled and chemically cross - linked networks of actin ﬁlaments over more than ﬁve decades of frequency . The high - frequency response reveals rich dynamics unique to semiﬂexible polymers , including a previously unobserved relaxation due to rapid axial tension propagation . For high molecular weight , and for cross - linked gels , we obtain quantitative agreement with predicted shear moduli in both amplitude and frequency dependence .

Ka The machinery that drives essential functions of cells such as locomotion and division is based on an elastic network of interconnected semiﬂexible protein ﬁlaments , collectively referred to as the cytoskeleton [ 1 ] . A major component of the cytoskeleton is the actin cortex , a dense meshwork of cross - linked actin ﬁlaments beneath the plasma membrane that is controlled by a host of accessory proteins . The physical construction of the cytoskeleton with its complex hierarchy of structural length scales en - ables the cell to produce large changes in physical proper - ties by small chemical interventions , such as length - or crosslink - control or regulated attachments to other struc - tures in the cell . The unique sensitivity of cytoskeletal networks stems in large part from the semiﬂexible charac - ter of its constituents , i . e . , the fact that their thermal persistence length l p [ 17 (cid:1) m for ﬁlamentous - actin ( F - actin ) [ 2 ] ] is orders of magnitude larger than molecular scales ( 7 nm ﬁlament diameter of actin [ 2 ] ) . The mechanical and dynamical ( rheological ) properties of semiﬂexible polymers have been the focus of intense research in recent years . Apart from their biological role , these networks have proven to be unique polymeric mate - rials in their own right . In contrast to ﬂexible polymer networks , the shear modulus of a semiﬂexible polymer network can be varied over many orders of magnitude by small changes in cross - linking [ 3 – 6 ] , and exhibits strong nonlinearities [ 3 , 5 , 7 , 8 ] . The dynamics of semiﬂexible so - lutions and gels have proven to be much richer than those of ﬂexible polymers . Even for single ﬁlaments there are multiple distinct modes of relaxation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional polymers [ 7 , 9 – 11 ] . It has proven challenging , however , to quantitatively probe those dynamic regimes experimentally , because of the extensive bandwidth required . Here , we have measured the dynamic shear modulus of F - actin solutions and cross - linked gels over a range of frequencies from 1 Hz to nearly 100 kHz . We ﬁnd quantitative agreement with theory for the modulus at high frequencies , conﬁrming the principal role of trans - verse thermal bending ﬂuctuations in determining the net - work response [ 12 , 13 ] . Furthermore , we demonstrate an intermediate - frequency relaxation mode that is unique to semiﬂexible polymers , and is due to rapid stress propaga - tion along the ﬁlament backbone leading to a retraction of the chain ends . This effect has been predicted [ 13 – 16 ] , but has not been observed previously . We achieve a bandwidth of 100 kHz by using an optical microrheology technique based on laser - interferometric detection of thermal ﬂuctuations of embedded probe par - ticles [ 11 , 17 ] . We have here used two - particle microrheol - ogy , measuring the cross - correlated thermal motion of pairs of particles at well - deﬁned separations . Correlations in displacements result from hydrodynamic and elastic interactions transmitted through the intervening material and report bulk viscoelasticity , virtually unaffected by the local particle environment [ 18 , 19 ] . In contrast , the shear moduli derived from one - particle microrheology in actin have been shown to differ from the bulk moduli measured with conventional rheometers [ 18 , 20 ] . Samples were prepared by mixing monomeric actin ( G - actin ) [ 21 ] with silica spheres of 1 : 16 (cid:1) m diameter , which were larger than the average mesh size [ 22 ] (cid:2) (cid:1) 0 : 3 = p c A , with c A the actin concentration ( 0 . 5 to 2 mg = ml ) [ 23 ] . Embedded silica particles with diameters less than 7 (cid:1) m did not settle under gravity during the course of the experiments . Polymerization was initiated by buffer change [ 21 ] and the sample was loaded into a glass cham - ber and equilibrated for 1 h at room temperature . Cross - linking was achieved by mixing G - actin ( A ) with bio - tinylated actin ( B ) ( ratio r AB (cid:1) 50 ) and neutravidin ( N ) ( r AN (cid:1) 25 ) . Microrheology was performed using laser interferometry and quadrant - photodiode detection in an inverted microscope , providing subnanometer resolution at 100 kHz bandwidth [ 11 , 17 ] . Pairs of probe particles located at least 20 (cid:1) m away from the sample chamber walls were illuminated by two weak ( < 5 mW ) focused laser beams ( wavelengths 1064 and 830 nm ) . The photo - diode signals corresponding to the displacements of the two particles ( labeled 1 and 2 ) from their respective detector - beam axes in the directions parallel ( x ) and per - pendicular ( y ) to the line connecting them were digitized at 195 kHz after antialias ﬁltering [ 17 ] . From the measured ﬂuctuations x 1 ; 2 (cid:2) t (cid:3) and y 1 ; 2 (cid:2) t (cid:3) we calculated the parallel and perpendicular time - averaged cross - correlation functions , PRL 96 , 138307 ( 2006 ) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 7 APRIL 2006 0031 - 9007 = 06 = 96 ( 13 ) = 138307 ( 4 ) $ 23 . 00 138307 - 1 © 2006 The American Physical Society C k (cid:2) !

For an isotropic and homogeneous medium , these two components completely characterize the full tensorial correlations . The ﬂuctuation - dissipation theorem relates these correlation functions to the corre - sponding mutual displacement response functions [ 24 ] , (cid:3) k ; ? (cid:2) ! (cid:3) (cid:1) (cid:3) 0k ; ?

The respective real parts (cid:3) 0k ; ? (cid:2) ! (cid:3) are computed from (cid:3) 00k ; ? (cid:2) ! (cid:3) by Kramers - Kronig integrals [ 11 , 24 ] . The connection be - tween the complex response functions ( corrected for the weak harmonic potentials created by the focused lasers [ 17 ] ) and the complex shear modulus G (cid:5) (cid:2) ! (cid:3) is given by a generalization of the Oseen tensor [ 18 , 19 ] : (cid:3) k (cid:1) 2 (cid:3) ? (cid:1) 1 = (cid:6) 4 (cid:4)r 12 G (cid:5) (cid:2) ! (cid:3)(cid:7) : ( 2 ) The complex modulus G (cid:5) (cid:2) ! (cid:3) has real and imaginary parts , G 0 (cid:2) ! (cid:3) and G 00 (cid:2) ! (cid:3) , which are known as the storage and loss modulus , respectively . For a viscous liquid of viscosity (cid:5) , G (cid:5) (cid:2) ! (cid:3) (cid:1) (cid:8) i ! (cid:5) , and these expressions reduce to the fa - miliar Oseen tensor [ 25 ] . Equation ( 2 ) assumes an incom - pressible viscoelastic medium [ 11 , 26 ] . This assumption is validated by our data , showing consistent results for G (cid:5) (cid:2) ! (cid:3) from the parallel and perpendicular displacement correla - tions . The shear moduli presented here are based on the less noisy parallel channel . For separation distances r 12 (cid:1) 3 – 20 (cid:1) m there was no distance dependence of the moduli , consistent with the assumption that the material connecting the particles at these distances behaves as a bulk viscoelas - tic material [ 18 , 19 ] . Figures 1 ( a ) and 1 ( b ) show the storage and loss moduli , G 0 (cid:2) ! (cid:3) and G 00 (cid:2) ! (cid:3) , of a 1 mg = ml solution of F - actin with - out and with cross - linking . The non - cross - linked solution has a low - frequency modulus of around 0 . 2 Pa , similar to values measured previously with conventional rheology [ 4 ] and microrheology [ 6 , 11 , 20 ] . The storage modulus shows no discernible elastic plateau over the frequency range studied here . After cross - linking , the storage modulus de - velops a plateau of around 46 Pa , while the loss modulus is slightly increased at intermediate frequencies and scales with frequency as G 00 (cid:2) ! (cid:3) (cid:9) ! 3 = 4 . Data at high frequencies can be quantitatively compared with theory . Theoretical models of the viscoelastic response of semiﬂexible poly - mer networks [ 12 , 13 ] predict that the shear modulus at high frequencies is entirely controlled by the relaxation of individual polymer chains . When a polymer network is sheared , the thermally undulating ﬁlaments are either com - pressed or stretched , depending on their orientation with respect to the shear direction . Since the ﬁlaments are practically inextensible along their contour , the chain con - formations rethermalize by a redistribution of their bend - ing modes , leading to a characteristic scaling of the polymer contribution to the shear modulus as G (cid:5) (cid:2) ! (cid:3) / ! 3 = 4 [ 12 , 13 ] : G (cid:5) (cid:2) ! (cid:3) (cid:10) 115 (cid:6)(cid:7)l p (cid:2)(cid:8) 2 i(cid:8) = (cid:7) (cid:3) 3 = 4 ! 3 = 4 (cid:8) i ! (cid:5) : ( 3 ) The linear ( viscous ) term in frequency dominates at high frequencies ( above the range of our experiments ) . In Eq . ( 3 ) , the density ( length / volume ) of ﬁlaments (cid:6) (cid:1) c A (cid:11) 3 : 8 (cid:11) 10 13 m (cid:8) 2 , the bending stiffness (cid:7) (cid:1) l p = k B T , and the lateral drag coefﬁcient per unit length (cid:8) (cid:10) 0 : 0023 N s = m 2 , are all known [ 12 , 13 ] . Thus , the solid lines in Figs . 1 ( a ) and 1 ( b ) represent the prediction of Eq . ( 3 ) with no adjustable parameters . The measured loss modulus G 00 (cid:2) ! (cid:3) for en - tangled actin approaches the theoretical prediction only at the highest frequencies probed , while upon cross - linking with practically irreversible biotin - neutravidin bonds , G 00 (cid:2) ! (cid:3) agrees with Eq . ( 3 ) over the whole experimental frequency range . The storage modulus G 0 (cid:2) ! (cid:3) for entangled actin also remains below the theoretical curve over the whole frequency range probed , while cross - linking leads to better agreement with Eq . ( 3 ) above the plateau . ( The elastic moduli are cut off at about 10 kHz , due to the high - frequency limit of the Kramers - Kronig integral . ) The pla - teau value of 46 Pa at low frequencies is consistent with theory [ 3 , 12 ] for an average distance between cross - links of about 1 : 8 (cid:1) m . In a regime where the modulus is dominated by single - ﬁlament dynamics , it should be linear in actin concentra - tion c A . By contrast , collective phenomena ( e . g . , entangle - ment ) will result in a stronger dependence . The inset of Fig . 1 ( b ) demonstrates the linear concentration dependence of the polymer contribution to the loss modulus , as ex - FIG . 1 . ( a ) Storage modulus G 0 (cid:2) !

From the lack of collapse of the non - crosslinked data , however , there seems to be a slight in - crease of the scaled modulus with actin concentration . This may reﬂect a concentration - dependent ﬁlament length distribution . Naı¨vely one would expect that entangled and cross - linked semiﬂexible polymer networks are indistinguish - able at frequencies above the elastic plateau . The fact that the shear moduli for entangled solutions of actin are below both the cross - linked and the theoretically predicted modulus implies an additional mechanism for relaxation of stress that disappears with cross - linking . The deviation from Eq . ( 3 ) is emphasized in the inset of Fig . 1 ( b ) , where the loss moduli are multiplied by ! (cid:8) 3 = 4 . This inset also shows that the increased relaxation at intermediate fre - quencies is present for a range of actin concentrations . It has recently been suggested [ 13 – 16 ] that , in the case of semiﬂexible polymers of ﬁnite length , rapid tension propa - gation along the ﬁlament backbone leads to an additional relaxation of network stress by the retraction or extension of ﬁlament ends . Experimental proof of this mechanism has been lacking so far . The data in Fig . 1 provide one test for this mechanism . Cross - linking should prevent ﬁlament end retraction , and indeed we ﬁnd quantitative agreement with high molecular weight theory upon cross - linking [ Eq . ( 3 ) , solid lines in Fig . 1 ] . We further test for this relaxation mechanism by exam - ining the polymer length dependence , which should be strong since the time it takes for tension to propagate along a ﬁlament of length L increases rapidly with length as t (cid:9) L 8 [ 13 – 16 ] . For shorter ﬁlaments the transition to the ! 3 = 4 regime should occur at higher frequencies , and the network should be softer at lower frequencies . To control average ﬁlament length we added the physiological capping protein gelsolin [ 27 ] . G - actin was polymerized at a ﬁxed concen - tration of 1 mg = ml in the presence of gelsolin at actin / gelsolin molar ratios r AG (cid:1) 370 – 6290 . Assuming random capping [ 27 ] , we estimate average lengths between 1 and 17 (cid:1) m . Figs . 2 ( a ) and 2 ( b ) show that the storage and loss moduli indeed decrease as the ﬁlament length is reduced . The slope of G 00 (cid:2) ! (cid:3) ( corrected for the solvent contribution ) increasingly approaches 1 , which is also consistent with a larger contribution of chain - end retraction to the stress relaxation . At present , there is no theory that accounts for the longitudinal relaxation while spanning dilute solu - tions and strongly entangled regimes . The lines in Figs . 2 ( a ) and 2 ( b ) are the predictions of Refs . [ 13 , 16 ] for dilute solutions of short chains ( 3 (cid:1) m , bottom ) and entangled solutions of long chains ( 17 (cid:1) m , middle ) . This theory with chain - end corrections , although it does not take into account the exponential length distribution of actin ﬁlaments [ 27 ] , qualitatively captures the trend towards lower shear moduli for shorter chains . The observed change in slope of G 00 (cid:2) ! (cid:3) to values higher than 3 = 4 is also consistent with the theoretical predictions . The shear moduli reported here were all obtained from thermal ﬂuctuations of embedded probe particles using Eq . ( 2 ) , which assumes an incompressible homogeneous medium [ 11 , 26 ] . Experimentally , the importance of com - pressibility can be tested by considering the ( real part of the ) ratio of the perpendicular and parallel cross - correlated particle displacements [ 19 ] : (cid:6) (cid:3) ? = (cid:3) k (cid:7) 0 (cid:1) 3 (cid:8) 4 (cid:9) 4 (cid:2) 1 (cid:8) (cid:9) (cid:3) ; ( 4 ) which has physical bounds of 1 = 2 and 7 = 8 , since the Poisson ratio (cid:9) is bounded by 1 = 2 and (cid:8) 1 , where the former corresponds to an incompressible medium [ 11 , 26 ] . Figure 3 shows ratios (cid:6) (cid:3) ? = (cid:3) k (cid:7) 0 measured for three particle distances r 12 in an entangled actin network . The ratio (cid:6) (cid:3) ? = (cid:3) k (cid:7) 0 is indeed close to 1 = 2 , consistent with a strong viscous coupling of the actin network to the solvent and in support of the incompressibility assumption . The deviations apparent at high frequencies are quantitatively consistent with ﬂuid inertial effects [ 28 ] . At low frequen - cies we are unable to demonstrate or exclude compressi - bility because of noise limitations , which are particularly pronounced in the perpendicular channel . We have measured the complex shear modulus G (cid:5) (cid:2) ! (cid:3) of F - actin solutions and gels over a wide frequency range . We show that at high frequencies the response is dominated by single - ﬁlament bending ﬂuctuations and is in quantitative agreement with theory [ 12 , 13 ] . Further , we demonstrate a dynamic mode that is unique to ( non - cross - linked ) semi - ﬂexible polymers , which is due to rapid axial stress relaxa - tion through free ﬁlament ends . Both relaxation modes are FIG . 2 . Filament length dependence of the storage modulus G 0 (cid:2) !
