Structural properties , biochemical analysis of its interaction partners and siRNA studies implicated mAbp1 as an accessory protein in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) . Here , we describe the generation and characterization of mice deﬁcient for SH3P7 / mAbp1 owing to targeted gene disruption in embryonic stem cells . Mutant animals are viable and fertile without obvious deﬁcits during the ﬁrst weeks of life . Abnormal structure and function of organs including the spleen , heart , and lung is observed at about 3 months of age in both heterozygous and homozygous mouse mutants . A moderate reduction of both receptor - mediated and synaptic endocytosis is observed in embryonic ﬁbroblasts and in synapses of hippocampal neurons , respectively . Recycling of synaptic vesicles in hippocampal boutons is severely impaired and delayed four - fold . The presynaptic defect of SH3P7 / mAbp1 mouse mutants is associated with their constri - cted physical capabilities and disturbed neuromotoric behaviour . Our data reveal a nonredundant role of SH3P7 / mAbp1 in CME and places its function downstream of vesicle ﬁssion .

Initiation of clathrin coat formation is regulated by clathrin - binding proteins such as the b 2 - adaptin component of the multimeric AP2 complex , which provides a direct link to membranes and membrane receptors ( Kirchhausen , 1999 ; Slepnev and De Camilli , 2000 ) . Vesicle ﬁssion from the donor membrane requires a member of the dynamin family of large GTPases ( Danino and Hinshaw , 2001 ) . A plethora of clathrin accessory proteins has been identiﬁed to assist coat formation and coat dynamics in a regulatable manner ( Marsh and McMahon , 1999 ; Slepnev and De Camilli , 2000 ) . Recently , the intracellular adaptor protein Src homology ( SH ) 3P7 ( Larbolette et al , 1999 ) ( also named HIP55 ) ( Ensenat et al , 1999 ) , which was found to represent the mammalian ortholog of yeast actin - binding protein 1 ( Abp1 ) ( Kessels et al , 2000 ) , has been added to this list . Mammalian Abp1 ( mAbp1 ) is expressed in many cell types and possesses a relative molecular mass of 55kDa . It was initially identiﬁed as a protein tyrosine kinase substrate colocalizing with the F - actin cytoskeleton in antigen recep - tor - stimulated lymphocytes ( Larbolette et al , 1999 ) . Abp1 binds F - actin with a stoichiometry of 1 : 5 by virtue of its N - terminal ADFH domain ( Lappalainen et al , 1998 ) and an adjacently located charged region with a tetrameric repeat of the consensus sequence R / KXEEXR ( Larbolette et al , 1999 ; Kessels et al , 2000 ) . The two independent actin - binding modules are followed C - terminally by a putative proline - rich recognition motif for SH3 domains and two known tyrosine - phosphorylation motifs , which provide phospho - acceptor sites for activated Src and Syk family kinases ( Lock et al , 1998 ; Larbolette et al , 1999 ) . The C - terminus of mAbp1 encompasses an SH3 domain , which allowed the initial cloning of the mabp1 cDNA ( Sparks et al , 1996 ) . Several ligands for the mAbp1 SH3 domain have been iden - tiﬁed ; for example , the hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 ( Ensenat et al , 1999 ) and the huntingtin - interacting protein , Hip1R ( S Connert , S Wienand and J Wienands , unpublished results ) . Furthermore , several neuronally expressed proteins interact with the mAbp1 SH3 domain , most notably pre - synaptic proteins implicated in clathrin - mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis and recycling , such as synaptojanin1 , Received : 16 August 2005 ; accepted : 28 February 2006 ; published online : 6 April 2006 * Corresponding author .

Also , the postsynaptic multidomain adaptor proteins ProSAP1 and ProSAP2 are mAbp1 - associated proteins ( Qualmann et al , 2004 ) . Overexpression studies in Cos - 7 cells ( Kessels et al , 2001 ) and siRNA - mediated knockdown experiments ( Han et al , 2003 ; Mise - Omata et al , 2003 ; Le Bras et al , 2004 ) revealed a regulatory role for mAbp1 on transferrin receptor uptake and TCR internalization , supporting the idea that mAbp1 is a key regulator in receptor - mediated endocytosis and vesicle trafﬁcking . This is also evident from biochemical and genetic studies on yeast Abp1 . For example , the proline - rich region of Abp1 recruits the SH3 domain of Rvs167 / amphiphysin ( Lila and Drubin , 1997 ) , which belongs to a protein family engaged in early events of endocytosis , for example , mem - brane curvature ( Takei et al , 1999 ; Peter et al , 2004 ) . Lack of Abp1 expression in yeast becomes lethal upon additional loss of the Sla2 protein ( for : synthetically lethal with abp1 ) ( Holtzman et al , 1993 ) . Sla2 protein is essential for both endocytosis and actin function ( Holtzman et al , 1993 ; Wesp et al , 1997 ; Yang et al , 1999 ) . The mammalian ortholog of Sla2 protein is Hip1R ( Seki et al , 1998 ) , which we identiﬁed as a mAbp1 - binding protein ( see above ) . So far , however , a detailed functional analysis of mAbp1 in primary mamma - lian cells is missing . Here we present the characterization of mouse mutants rendered deﬁcient for the expression of mAbp1 by gene targeting . Although initially normal , mAbp1 - negative mice develop several organ abnormalities including splenomegaly , a four - chamber dilation of the heart and lung emphysema . On the molecular level , clathrin - mediated uptake of ﬂuores - cent markers in ﬁbroblasts and hippocampal neurons is slightly reduced . A dramatic defect is observed for the refor - mation of fusion - competent vesicles in synapses , which can explain the severe behavioral deﬁcits in mAbp1 - negative mice . Results Targeted disruption of mabp1 A targeting vector was generated , which upon homologous recombination in BALB / c embryonic stem ( ES ) cells deleted exons 2 and 3 of the mabp1 gene ( Figure 1A ) .

Male chimeras were bred with wild - type ( wt ) BALB / c females . PCR - based genotyping ( Figures 1A and B ) identiﬁed mabp1 þ / þ , mabp1 þ / (cid:2) , and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice in the F2 generation with Mendelian ratios of 35 , 41 , and 24 % , respectively ( n ¼ 206 ) . mabp1 - deﬁcient mice are viable and both genders are fertile and equally represented in the total F2 population as well as in the mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) subpopulation . The absence of mAbp1 protein expression in mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice is shown for lysates from total brain and spleen in immunoblot analysis ( Figure 1C ) . Note that in heterozygous animals , mAbp1 is expressed at a lower level than that in wt controls ( lanes 3 , 6 and 1 , 4 , respectively ) . Expression level of proteins that are structurally and / or functionally related to mAbp1 is unaltered in mAbp1 mutant mice As described , mAbp1 is a multidomain adaptor interacting with a variety of other proteins , especially in neuronal cells . We thus assessed whether loss of mAbp1 affects the expres - sion levels of other proteins implicated in mAbp1 function . Figure 2 shows immunoblot analysis of cleared cellular lysates of cerebrum ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , cerebellum ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , and brain stem ( lanes 5 and 6 ) with antibodies to amphiphysin , synapsinIa / Ib , synaptotagmin1 , clathrin HC , synaptojanin1 , Hip1R , dynamin , synaptophysin , and cort - actin . Quantiﬁcation of band intensities ( Figure 2C ) revealed no signiﬁcant changes in the expression levels of these proteins in mabp1 - deﬁcient brain cells . Pathological changes in mabp1 - deﬁcient mice Total necropsy of mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice showed pathological changes in the spleen , heart , and lung .

The diagram depicts relative differences between the expression levels of the analyzed proteins in mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) and wt mice . Error bars represent standard deviations calculated on the basis of two independent experiments . Figure 3 Altered anatomy of the spleen , lung , and heart in mabp1 - deﬁcient mice .

( D ) Four chamber dilatations and a left atrial thrombus is observed in mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice ( hematoxilin / eosin ( HE ) staining , left panel ) , additionally all chambers of the mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) heart show extensive ﬁbrosis ( red ) ( Sirius red staining , right panel ) . For comparison , an age - matched wt heart is shown . RV ¼ right ventricle ; LV ¼ left ventricle ; and LA ¼ left atrium ( scale bars 2mm ) . mAbp1 deﬁciency symptoms S Connert et al & 2006 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 25 | NO 8 | 2006 1613 observed in heterozygous mabp1 þ / (cid:2) mice indicating a gene dosage effect . Loss of mAbp1 leads to heart failure symptoms ( observed in 44 . 7 and 48 . 1 % of mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) and mabp1 þ / (cid:2) male mice and in 48 . 9 and 33 . 3 % of mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) and mabp1 þ / (cid:2) female mice , respectively ) with labored breathing and genera - lized edemia ( Figures 3B and C ) . mabp1 - deﬁcient hearts show dilation of all four chambers associated with thrombi in atrias and ventricles ( Figure 3D , left panel ) and massive interstitial ﬁbrosis ( Figure 3D , right panel ) . Lungs of mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice possess abnormal structure and develop emphysema and edemia ( Figure 3B ) , which are frequently associated with heart insufﬁciencies , and hence may represent a secondary mAbp1 deﬁciency symptom . The data show that mAbp1 expression is required for proper function of different tissues in a gene dosage - dependent manner . Receptor - mediated endocytosis is slightly reduced in mabp1 - deﬁcient mice As mAbp1 has been implicated in vesicle endocytosis and trafﬁcking ( Kessels et al , 2001 ; Mise - Omata et al , 2003 ) , we investigated transferrin uptake in ﬁbroblasts from day 15 mabp1 þ / þ and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) embryos . Following incubation of mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) with Cy2 - conjugated mouse transferrin , only minor differences in transferrin inter - nalization were observed ( Figure 4A ) . The amount of trans - ferrin uptake was measured at different time points by quantitative analysis of the per - cell ﬂuorescence intensities . Comparison of the initial internalization rates revealed a modest decrease ( B 20 % ) in transferrin uptake in mabp1 - deﬁcient ﬁbroblasts ( Figure 4B ) . It thus appears that loss of mAbp1 can be partially compensated by other proteins or that mAbp1 functions in a step downstream of vesicle budding and ﬁssion . The functional recycling pool size is reduced in mabp1 - deﬁcient hippocampal neurons Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) plays a fundamental role in presynaptic exo – endocytic vesicle cycling . Thus , we performed live cell imaging on hippocampal neurons derived from mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) and mabp1 þ / þ mice using the ﬂuorescent tracer FM1 – 43 to directly assess exo – endocytoic turnover of synaptic vesicles ( Betz and Bewick , 1992 ; Ryan and Smith , 1995 ) . Images of FM - dye - stained hippocampal neurons from wt and mabp1 - deﬁcient mice do not show any obvious differences in arborization , bouton density , or distribution ( Figure 5A ) . Upon staining by triggering action potentials ( APs ) and dye washout FM - labelled boutons were maximally unloaded with 900APs . Differences between the ﬂuorescence signals ( D F ) before and after complete destaining yield a measure of the relative numbers of endocytosed and recycled vesicles . In Figure 5B , D F values of individual boutons for a 40 - AP loading train are plotted in a histogram for both phenotypes . This stimulus is expected to release most vesi - cles docked at the AZ , belonging to the readily releasable pool ( Stevens and Williams , 2000 ) . The average D F value is signiﬁcantly smaller in mabp1 - deﬁcient boutons , indicating that the recycled vesicles repopulate the readily releasable pool less efﬁciently in mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) synapses .

Initial internalization rates were determined by regression analysis ( dashed lines ) over the ﬁrst 5 time points ( slopes of 2 . 9 7 0 . 16 for mabp1 þ / þ cells and 2 . 2 7 0 . 45 for mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells , respectively ) revealing a moderate reduction of approximately 20 % of receptor - mediated endocytosis in mabp1 - deﬁcient cells ( errors of slopes are the conﬁdence intervals at 95 % level ) .

A signiﬁcant difference is noted with an asterisk ( P o 0 . 05 ) . mAbp1 deﬁciency symptoms S Connert et al The EMBO Journal VOL 25 | NO 8 | 2006 & 2006 European Molecular Biology Organization 1614 Figure 5C , this average D F value rises with increasing stimu - lus length until reaching a plateau for about 600APs in control ( mabp1 þ / þ ) synaptic boutons , in agreement with published data ( Ryan et al , 1996 ; Kim et al , 2002 ) . FM1 – 43 uptake in mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) boutons also plateaued at about 600 APs , but D F , that is , the size of total recycling pool , is reduced to the same degree as the recycling to the readily releasable pool . We next compared the destaining kinetics of presynaptic terminals loaded with FM1 – 43 to saturation ( Figure 5D ) . During brief electrical stimulation ( 40 AP at 20Hz ) , both mabp1 þ / þ and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) boutons released about 20 % of dye . The remaining dye fraction was released by pro - longed stimulation ( 900APs ) with the same kinetics in both mabp1 þ / þ and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) boutons . These data indicate that in mabp1 - deﬁcient neurons , recycled synaptic vesicles undergo exocytosis with the same release probability as in mabp1 þ / þ control cells , but the size of the functional total recycling vesicle pool is somewhat reduced . Taken together , styryl dye uptake probing stimulated endocytosis in hippo - campal boutons is reduced to a similar degree as receptor - mediated endocytosis in MEFs probed by transferrin uptake . Thus , mAbp1 may be more important in a subsequent step , that is , in the proper recycling of synaptic vesicles . The reformation of fusion - competent synaptic vesicles is severely impaired and delayed in mabp1 - deﬁcient boutons To test a potential role of mabp1 in synaptic vesicle recycling or repriming , we performed pulse - chase experiments . Boutons were labelled during a 10s pulse of FM1 – 43 with 100APs at 10Hz ( Figure 5E , inset , for details see Materials and methods ) . Electrical ﬁeld stimulation was continued after the FM - dye pulse for different chase times ( 0 – 160s ) . Vesicles endocytosed during dye application recycle back to the relea - sable pool , are reprimed , and eventually exocytosed for a second time , thereby releasing their trapped FM dye . The residual fraction of labelled vesicles for a given chase time D t was determined as the D F value for complete destaining 10min later . Plotting the fractions of recycled vesicles ( see ﬁgure legend for details ) for each chase time revealed a severe defect in the regeneration of functional synaptic vesicles during prolonged stimulation ( Figure 5E ) . For control mabp1 þ / þ boutons , repriming kinetics and efﬁcacy were similar to those previously described for rat hippocampal neurons ( Ryan and Smith , 1995 ) . The minimum repriming time was about 15s , and about 60 % of the dye taken up is released during 100s of continued stimulation . In contrast , in mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) synapses the minimum repriming time was delayed four - fold to 60s , and only about 30 % of the dye could be released again during stimulation continued for up to 150s . These results reveal a dramatic defect in the reformation of functional synaptic vesicles in the absence of mabp1 , indicating that mAbp1 acts downstream of vesicle budding .

The minimum repriming time of 10 – 20s for control mabp1 þ / þ is delayed to 60 – 80s in mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) synapses .

Error bars are conﬁdence intervals of the mean at 95 % level . mAbp1 deﬁciency symptoms S Connert et al & 2006 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 25 | NO 8 | 2006 1615 Ultrastructural analysis reveals three - fold more endosome - like intermediates in mabp1 - deﬁcient boutons To correlate the physiology of synaptic boutons with their ultrastructure , we analyzed wt and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) synapses in hippocampal cultures with respect to total numbers of vesi - cles and the number of vesicles docked to the AZ by electron microscopy ( Figure 6 ) . The numbers of synaptic vesicle proﬁles per synapse area ( Figure 6B and C ) , closer than 20nm to or docked at the AZ per AZ length ( Figure 6D and E ) , were not signiﬁcantly different . We observed , however , a signiﬁcant accumulation of endosome - like structures ( 4 60nm ) , presumably endocytic intermediates , in mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) hippocampal boutons ( Figure 6F ) . These cisternae may either represent true endosomal intermediates ( Heuser and Reese , 1973 ) or , more likely , may arise from bulk endocytosis of large infoldings from the plasma membrane ( Takei et al , 1996 ; Richards et al , 2000 ) . The physiological and ultrastruc - tural data reveal an important role for mAbp1 in CME of synaptic vesicle membrane . The severe delay in recycling observed in the FM experiments can now be explained on the ultrastructural level by a delay in vesicle ﬁssion either from the plasma membrane , leading to the formation of large infoldings , or from endosomal intermediates , resulting in the accumulation of endosome - like structures . Synaptic localization of mAbp1 - associated proteins is unaltered in mabp1 - deﬁcient mice These physiological and ultrastructural data prompted us to ask whether synaptic expression and localization of mAbp1 - associated proteins involved in CME may be altered . Thus , we determined synaptic expression and localization of clathrin light chain ( CLC ) , dynamin1 , and F - actin by immuno - cytochemistry . Synaptic boutons were identiﬁed by costaining Figure 6 Ultrastructural analysis of synaptic boutons in hippocampal cultures . ( A ) Representative synaptic boutons from wt and mabp1 - deﬁcient hippocampal cultures ( scale bars 0 . 3 m m ) . ( B ) The distributions of the number of vesicles per bouton area are similar in wt ( n ¼ 34 ) and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) synapses ( n ¼ 30 ) . Total numbers of vesicles are 3729 for wt and 3630 for mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) synapses . ( C ) Average number of synaptic vesicles ( SV ) per 1 m m 2 bouton area are similar in wt ( 231 . 63 7 10 . 92 ) and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) synapses ( 214 . 83 7 14 . 87 ) . ( D ) Average numbers of morphologically docked vesicles per AZ length are similar in mAbp1 - positive ( n ¼ 20 ) and mAbp1 - negative synapses ( n ¼ 25 ) . ( E ) Average numbers of vesicles close to the AZ ( o 20nm ) per AZ length are similar in wt ( n ¼ 20 ) and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) synapses ( n ¼ 25 ) . ( F ) The number of endosome - like intermediates per synapse is signiﬁcantly higher in mabp1 - deﬁcient ( 2 . 497 7 0 . 464 ) than in wt ( 0 . 853 7 0 . 212 ) synapses . mAbp1 deﬁciency symptoms S Connert et al The EMBO Journal VOL 25 | NO 8 | 2006 & 2006 European Molecular Biology Organization 1616 for the bona ﬁde synaptic marker protein synaptophysin1 ( Figure 7A ) . The localization and distribution of synapto - physin1 is almost identical between hippocampal neurons of mabp1 þ / þ and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice ( Figure 7A , left panels ) . Consistent with previous reports , we found extensive colo - calization of synaptophysin1 with CLC , dynamin1 , and F - actin in both mabp1 þ / þ and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) hippocampal neurons ( Figure 7A , middle and right panels ) . Furthermore , we estimated the synaptic concentrations of CLC , dynamin1 , and F - actin by quantifying ﬂuorescence intensities in synap - tophysin1 - positive puncta only . These were identiﬁed and delimited in a user - unbiased manner by an automated detec - tion algorithm ( see Materials and methods for details ) . Averaged ﬂuorescence intensities from different dishes ana - lyzed on different days were normalized to the simulta - neously recorded synaptophysin1 ﬂuorescence intensities ( Figure 7B ) , as these were identical in mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) and wt synapses . Although synaptic expression and localization of dynamin1 and F - actin were identical , CLC may be slightly enriched in mabp1 - deﬁcient boutons . Proﬁling speciﬁc motor skills of mabp1 mutant mice The observed presynaptic defect in mAbp1 - negative neurons is associated with severe neuromotoric deﬁcits of mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . Between 60 and 290 days after birth , 64 % of male and 54 % of female mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice developed characteristic symptoms like rufﬂed up fur , muscle trembling , convulsions , partial paralysis of the hind limbs , and reduced body weight ( Figure 8B and Supplementary Figure 1A and B ) .

Impaired locomotion and bad coordination are obvious from a tail - suspension test ( Figure 8A ) . The average age at the onset of the neuromotoric malfunction is dependent on the gender . Female mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice acquire behavioral abnormalities earlier than their male counterparts ( 80 versus 170 days ) , but are less sensitive to loss of a single mabp1 allele ( Figure 8B ) . To test higher brain function and spatial learn - ing , we aimed at applying the Morris water maze test ( Morris , 1989 ) . However , the ability to swim was severely and pro - gressively affected in mutant mice ( Supplementary Movies 1A and B ) to such an extent that this test could not be conducted . Motoric behavioral capabilities were tested by Rotarod test , footprint analysis , and Beam walking . Walking on a Rotarod is a difﬁcult motor coordination and balance control test . mabp1 þ / þ female and male mice maintained balance for 230 7 36 and 278 7 31 s , respectively ( Figure 8D ) . Female mabp1 þ / (cid:2) and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice stayed on the Rotarod for 14 7 4 and 9 7 7s . Male mabp1 þ / (cid:2) and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice persevered for 7 7 1 and 5 7 4s , respectively . Severe deﬁcits in motor performance are also obvious from altered foot placement investigated by gauging the trajectory of mabp1 - deﬁcient animals . A signiﬁcant and progressive reduction in left – right alteration length of hind limbs became apparent in female and male mabp1 þ / (cid:2) and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice upon the onset of ﬁrst symptoms ( Figure 8C ) . In Beam walking experiments , wt mice reached the platform with approximately two missteps ( Figure 8E ) . Male and female mabp1 þ / (cid:2) and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice made signiﬁcantly more missteps in a gene dose - dependent manner ( female mabp1 þ / (cid:2) and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) 4 and 6 , respectively , and male mabp1 þ / (cid:2) and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) 3 and 5 , respectively ) . The ob - served motoric dysfunctions are not caused by muscular defects as indicated by ﬁrst , normal expression of acetylcho - line receptor a - subunit , second unaltered muscle architecture ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) , and ﬁnally , normal grip strength of mAbp1 - negative mice ( data not shown ) . Collectively , our experiments demonstrate strongly reduced ﬁne motor coordi - nation of hetero - and homozygous mabp1 mutant mice . Note that impaired Rotarod and Beam walking performances are observed before the appearance of any signs of illness or physical abnormalities . This shows that disturbed behavior is a direct consequence of the mabp1 mutation and not an indirect result of loosing body weight or getting weaker . Figure 8 Characterization of behavioral abnormalities of mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . ( A ) wt mice spread their limbs during a tail - suspension test while mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice react with hind - and forelimb clasping . ( B ) The onset of mAbp1 deﬁciency symptoms for female mabp1 þ / (cid:2) ( n ¼ 16 ) and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) ( n ¼ 29 ) mice as well as male mabp1 þ / (cid:2) ( n ¼ 21 ) and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) ( n ¼ 24 ) mice were investigated over a period of 1 year . No symptoms were identiﬁed for mabp1 þ / þ littermates used as controls ( female n ¼ 12 , male n ¼ 10 ) . Error bars represent standard deviations . ( C ) Evaluation of foot placement was performed by recording footprints of mice with differently painted forelimb ( red ) and hindlimb ( green ) . Analysis of path geometry revealed differences in left – right ( LR ) alteration between mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) ( n ¼ 13 ) and mabp1 þ / þ mice ( n ¼ 9 ) upon the onset of the disease symptoms ( scale bar 1cm ) . ( D ) In a Rotarod test , time to fall off ( s ) was determined in ﬁve test sessions performed every second day at a ﬁxed daytime . A maximum score of 300s was given to those mice not falling off within this period of time . The average time to fall off is shown with standard deviations . Female mabp1 þ / þ ( n ¼ 2 ) , mabp1 þ / (cid:2) ( n ¼ 3 ) , and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) ( n ¼ 3 ) mice as well as male mabp1 þ / þ ( n ¼ 2 ) , mabp1 þ / (cid:2) ( n ¼ 3 ) , and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) ( n ¼ 4 ) mice with no obvious mAbp1 deﬁciency symptoms were employed . ( E ) Beam walking experiments , performed three times at intervals of 1 week , revealed deﬁcits in motor abilities in a gene dose - dependent manner . The average number of missteps was determined for female mabp1 þ / þ ( n ¼ 4 ) , mabp1 þ / (cid:2) ( n ¼ 6 ) , and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) ( n ¼ 4 ) mice and male mabp1 þ / þ ( n ¼ 4 ) , mabp1 þ / (cid:2) ( n ¼ 4 ) , and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) ( n ¼ 5 ) mice with no obvious symptoms . Error bars represent standard deviations . mAbp1 deﬁciency symptoms S Connert et al The EMBO Journal VOL 25 | NO 8 | 2006 & 2006 European Molecular Biology Organization 1618 Discussion Previous studies implicated the cytoskeleton adaptor protein mAbp1 as a component of the endocytic machinery as it was found to bind several key molecules required for F - actin and membrane vesicle dynamics . The functional relevance of the reported protein – protein interactions , however , remained unclear . Here , we have analyzed the in vivo function of mAbp1 by gene targeting in mice . Our analysis of the result - ing mouse mutants revealed a critical role of mAbp1 for the integrity of several organs , synaptic transmission , and normal neuromotoric function . Mechanistically , we could place mAbp1 function to a step orchestrating endocytic vesicle departure downstream of budding and ﬁssion from the plasma membrane . Neonatal mAbp1 mutant mice develop without obvious pathological symptoms during the ﬁrst weeks of life . About 4 months after birth , both homo - and heterozygous mAbp1 mutants develop severe organ abnormalities . The spleen size increases two - to four - fold . The exact reason for the spleno - megaly is yet unclear , but an increased blood load containing the normal distribution of blood cell populations rather than histological alterations were routinely observed ( data not shown ) . The hypertrophic heart of mAbp1 mutant mice is characterized by dilation of all chambers , which possess thrombi and massive interstitial ﬁbrosis . Beside mAbp1 , several actin - binding proteins , such as cardiac b - myosin heavy chain , cardiac actin , muscle LIM protein , lamin , or desmin , have been recently described to be critical for proper heart function ( Seidman and Seidman , 2001 ) . Mutations in these genes in mice or humans cause severe cardiomyo - pathies presumably owing to ineffective production or trans - mission of contractile forces , which renders affected hearts highly susceptible to mechanical stress . Presumably as a secondary effect , which is usually associated with heart failure , mAbp1 mutants develop emphysema and edemia also in the lung . These data show that in vivo , mAbp1 fulﬁlls a nonredundant function , which is already compromised upon loss of a single mabp1 allele and thus appears to be rate limiting . To address mAbp1 function in more molecular details , we employed common experimental systems to study different stages of the endocytic process . We found a signiﬁcant albeit moderate effect of mAbp1 ablation on transferrin and FM styryl dye uptake in embryonic ﬁbroblasts and in synaptic boutons of primary hippocampal neurons , respectively . In line with these data , RNAi - mediated inhibition of mAbp1 expression ( Mise - Omata et al , 2003 ) as well as overexpres - sion experiments ( Kessels et al , 2001 ; Mise - Omata et al , 2003 ) previously suggested an endocytic function of mAbp1 in mammalian cells including T - lymphocytes . The development and function of Tcells is , however , almost normal in mAbp1 - negative mice ( Han et al , 2005 ; own unpublished results ) , indicating that a certain degree of redundancy exists at least in this cell type . Indeed , in yeast cells , the Sla2 protein is capable of compensating for the loss of Abp1 as endocytic defects are obvious only upon simultaneous loss of both proteins ( Holtzman et al , 1993 ; Yang et al , 1999 ) . In support of this , lack of the mammalian Sla2 ortholog , Hip1R , does not affect growth and viability of genetically engineered mouse mutants ( Hyun et al , 2004 ) . Our data do not argue against the possibility that the presence of mAbp1 may compensate for the loss of Hip1R in these mice , but deﬁnitely exclude a functional replacement of mAbp1 by Hip1R . Nonetheless , the two proteins may function in a common step of the endocytic process , but our live cell imaging data of the repriming kinetics in mabp1 - deﬁcient boutons establishes that the major and speciﬁc function of mAbp1 is downstream of clathrin vesicle formation at the stage of vesicle ﬁssion . This is also supported by the ultrastructural analysis showing an accumulation of endosome - like endocytic intermediates in mabp1 - deﬁcient cells . In support of this and as shown more recently , association of mAbp1 with actin comet tails occurs subsequently to dynamin function and clathrin release ( Merriﬁeld et al , 2005 ; Newpher et al , 2005 ; Yarar et al , 2005 ) . The presynaptic mAbp1 function can apparently not be compensated for by other endocytic proteins . mAbp1 is instrumental for normal neuromotoric function as indicated by the severely and progressively disturbed motor skills accompanied with mAbp1 deﬁciency symptoms . The impor - tance of mAbp1 for neuronal function ﬁts with previous reports demonstrating colocalization and linkage of mAbp1 with various neuronal proteins such as piccolo , ProSAP1 and ProSAP2 ( Fenster et al , 2003 ; Qualmann et al , 2004 ) , synap - tojanin1 , synapsin1 , dynamin1 ( Kessels et al , 2001 ) , and Rvs167p / amphiphysin ( Lila and Drubin , 1997 ) . Lack of three of the latter four proteins reduces the total pool of recycling vesicles to approx . 60 – 70 % ( Ryan et al , 1996 ; Di Paolo et al , 2002 ; Kim et al , 2002 ) . A four - fold increase in vesicle repriming time is observed in synaptojanin1 ( Kim et al , 2002 ) as well as in our mabp1 - deﬁcient cells , which limits the availability of fusion - competent vesicles and should result in synaptic depression in highly active neurons . This explains the motoric dysfunctioning . Surprisingly , no abnormalities on the overall morphology of the CNS were observed by various histological stainings of brain and spinal cord sections of mAbp1 - mutant mice ( data not shown ) . In conclusion , gene targeting in ES cells has elucidated a central and nonredundant in vivo function of the cytoskeleton adaptor protein mAbp1 for endocytic membrane transport . Secondly , mAbp1 acts predominantly and in a rate - limiting manner downstream of clathrin vesicle formation ( and Hip1R function ) at a stage of vesicle ﬁssion and transport . In the absence of mAbp1 expression , several cell types become affected , most notably neurons with respect to synaptic transmission , causing severe behavioral abnormalities . This provides further and direct evidence for the importance of the actin cytoskeleton and its inducible reorganization by actin - binding proteins in endocytic processes and vesicle trafﬁck - ing ( Benesch et al , 2005 ; Merriﬁeld et al , 2005 ; Yarar et al , 2005 ) . In future studies , mAbp1 mouse mutants may serve as a model system to investigate human diseases such as cardiac hypertrophy or neuronal disorders . Materials and methods Construction of targeting constructs Genomic DNA encompassing parts of intron 1 and intron 3 to exon 10 were ampliﬁed by PCR and cloned into pCRII - TOPO vector ( Invitrogen , Karlsruhe , Germany ) . A 822bp Sal I / Eag I fragment was replaced by a 1100bp Eag I / Xho I neomycin resistance cassette fragment from pBSmuneopac ( kindly provided by S Kuppig , Freiburg ) to create the ﬁnal targeting abp1 KO vector having the neomycin resistance cassette in place of exons 2 and 3 and in reverse transcriptional orientation of the abp1 gene . mAbp1 deﬁciency symptoms S Connert et al & 2006 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 25 | NO 8 | 2006 1619 Screening of ES cells BALB / c ES cells selected with G418 for the uptake of Pvu I - linearized targeting vector were screened for correct homologous recombina - tion by Southern blot analysis using three different hybridization probes . A 5 0 external probe ( probe A : 299bp , parts of exon 1 and adjacent sequence of intron 1 ) detected homologous recombination of the short arm , probe B of the neomycin resistance cassette ( probe B : 435bp , neomycin resistance cassette speciﬁc ) monitored single insertion of the targeting construct , and probe C ( probe C : 306bp , encompassing exons 7 and 8 ) served as a 3 0 internal probe . Genotyping Tail biopsies were incubated with 3U ( 0 . 3 m g / m l ) of Proteinase K ( Promega , Mannheim , Germany ) in 300 m l lysis buffer ( 10mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 50mM KCl , 0 . 45 % Tween 20 , 0 . 45 % NP40 ) overnight with agitation at 55 1 C . Subsequent incubation at 95 1 C for 10min inactivated Proteinase K . Samples were centrifuged for 30s and directly used for PCR analysis with the Taq PCR Master Mix Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) . PCR primers 5 0 CACTGTTCATCTGCCCC AGCAGC3 0 and 5 0 GGCTCTATGGCTTCTGAGGCGGA3 0 were used to generate a 1138bp fragment of the inactivated mabp1 alleles and primers 5 0 CTGCTGTCTACCCTCAGGCTATG3 0 and 5 0 GCCAGCCACAC GGATGTCATTGC3 0 to generate a 611bp amplicon of the wt allele , respectively . Immunoblotting of mouse tissue proteins Mouse tissues ( 100mg ) were homogenized in 100 m l 1M Tris – HCl , pH 6 . 8 , in an ultraturrax and supplemented with 500 m l loading buffer ( 62 . 5mM Tris – HCl , pH 6 . 8 , 20mM DTT , 20 % glycerol , 6 % SDS , 0 . 02 % bromophenol blue ) . Samples were agitated for 10min , heated to 95 1 C for 5min , and centrifuged for 10min at 7000 g . Equal amounts of protein supernatants were analyzed by speciﬁc antibodies . Monitoring speciﬁc motor skills Tail - suspension test . Mice were suspended in the air by the tail for 20 – 60s to verify clasping behavior . Rotarod test . Mice were trained on the Rotarod ( TSE Scientiﬁc Systems , Bad Homburg , Germany ) at a constant rotation speed of 26r . p . m . , to ensure that wt mice were capable of running the test without getting tired and unconcen - trated . The time to fall off of the Rotarod was measured . Footprint test . Feet were painted with nontoxic paints and placed in a 50cm long , 10cm wide , 10cm high runway with an inciting enclosed box to hide at the end . Beam walking . Mice had to cross a 50cm long strip of wood with a diameter of 1cm to reach an attached escape box . The number of missteps was counted . Histological studies and mouse cell culture Paraformaldehyde - ﬁxed LV tissue slices were embedded and stained as described ( Hilﬁker - Kleiner et al , 2004 ) . Primary MEFs were isolated from embryos at day 15 of gestation . Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) containing 15 % fetal calf serum , penicillin / streptomycin , nonessential amino acids , glutamax , and b - mercaptoethanol in a 37 1 C incubator with 5 % CO 2 . Hippocampal neurons from regions CA1 – CA3 of 1 - day - old mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) and mabp1 þ / þ mice were cultured and maintained as described ( Klingauf et al , 1998 ) . Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using the program STATISTICA 6 . 0 . Weights of spleens were normalized to the body weight ; mean values and standard deviation were calculated and examined for normal distribution by Smirnov – Kolmogorov test of normality . Sub - sequently , a one - way analysis of variance was used to determine the levels of difference between all groups / genotypes . The P - value for signiﬁcance was set to 0 . 05 . Transferrin uptake assay MEFs , grown to 50 – 60 % conﬂuency , were incubated for 2h at 37 1 C in starving medium ( serum - free DMEM containing 20mM HEPES and 0 . 1 % BSA ) . Cells were then incubated on ice for 5min and loaded with Cy2 - labelled mouse transferrin ( 20 m g / ml ; Dianova , Hamburg , Germany ) for 15min at 4 1 C . Transferrin internalization was triggered by raising the temperature to 37 1 C for 1 – 5 and 10min . Cells were washed with ice - cold starving medium and PBS containing 10mM MgCl 2 immediately thereafter , followed by two wash steps with 0 . 2M sodium acetate ( pH 4 . 5 ) and 0 . 5M NaCl to remove surface - bound transferrin . Before ﬁxation with 4 % paraf - ormaldehyde , cells were washed two times with cold starving medium and once with PBS . Images were taken with a slow - scan CCD camera ( Sensicam QE , PCO , Kelheim , Germany ) using a (cid:4) 63 / 1 . 2NA W objective on an inverted microscope ( Axiovert 135 TV , Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) . Single - cell ﬂuorescence intensities were determined by subtraction of background and autoﬂuorescence of nonstained control cells ( mock treatment ) for all time points . Quantitative FM1 – 43 imaging and analysis Neurons grown on coverslips were mounted in a laminar ﬂow perfusion chamber and imaged with an ICCD camera ( PentaMAX , Princeton Instruments , Monmouth Junction , USA ) through a (cid:4) 63 / 1 . 2W objective on an inverted microscope ( Axiovert S100 , Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) using a monochromator for excitation at 470nm ( Polychrome IV , TILL Photonics , 10nm bandwidth ) , and dichroic and emission ﬁlters 495DCLP and HQ560 / 40 , respectively ( AHF Analysetechnik , Tubingen , Germany ) . Cells were perfused with a modiﬁed Tyrode’s solution containing 150mM NaCl , 5mM KCl , 2mM CaCl 2 , 1mM MgCl 2 , 10mM HEPES , and 30mM glucose ( 330mOsm , pH 7 . 3 ) . For electric ﬁeld stimulation ( 1ms pulses , 40mA , delivered by platinum – iridium electrodes spaced at 15mm ) , 10 m M 6 - cyano - 7 - nitroquinoxaline - 2 , 3 - dione and 50 m M D , L - 2 - ami - no - 5 - phosphonovaleric acid were added to prevent recurrent activity . FM1 – 43 ( Molecular Probes Inc . , Eugene , OR ) was used at a concentration of 10 and 15 m M for global and local application , respectively , left in the bath for one more minute after the end of stimulation , and then washed off for 10min . For rapid local perfusion , an SF77 fast step perfusion system was utilized ( Warner Instruments , USA ) . Fluorescence intensities of individual synapses were quantiﬁed by averaging a 4 (cid:4) 4pixel area centered at the ﬂuorescent punctum . Electron microscopy Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from wt and mabp1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice at postnatal days 0 – 1 as described previously . On 12 – 14 days , in vitro cells were ﬁxed overnight at 4 1 C in cacodylat buffer containing 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde , 1 % paraformal - dehyde , and 0 . 1 % tannic acid . After three washes in cacodylat buffer , cells were postﬁxed with 1 % osmium tetroxide at room temperature ( RT ) for 1h , extensively washed with deionized distilled water , and stained with 1 . 5 % uranyl acetate . Cultures were then embedded in Epon 812 after dehydration in an ethanol series . Ultrathin sections ( B 60nm ) were collected on Formvar - coated nickel grids , stained with uranyl acetate ( 7min ) and lead citrate ( 2min ) , and viewed with a Zeiss EM912 electron microscope , photographed , and printed at a ﬁnal magniﬁcation of (cid:4) 50000 . Morphological analysis was performed with Metamorph software ( Molecular Devices , Downingtown , PA ) . Immunocytochemistry and data analysis Hippocampal cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde after 12 – 14 days of culture , permeabilized , and blocked simultaneously in PBS with 0 . 4 % Saponin and 2 % normal goat serum for 1h and incubated with primary antibodies speciﬁc for synaptophysin1 , dynamin1 , and CLC for 16h at 4 1 C . Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit ( Molecular Probes ; MoBiTec , Go¨ttingen , Germany ) and Cy3 - conjugated goat anti - mouse ( Dianova , Hamburg , Germany ) antibodies were used as secondary antibodies . F - actin staining was performed with phalloidin – TRITC ( Sigma - Aldrich , Munich , Germany ) concomitantly with secondary antibody incuba - tion for 1h at RT . Cells were mounted in Citiﬂour AF1 ( Science Services , Munich , Germany ) and ﬂuorescence images were captured simultaneously by confocal laser scanning microscopy ( Leica SP2 , (cid:4) 63 / 1 . 2W objective , laser beam expanded to ﬁll back pupil of objective , 59nm pixel size , pinhole set to 1 Airy ) . Images were background subtracted and further analyzed by self - written macros in Igor Pro ( Wavemetrics , Lake Oswego , OR , USA ) . To avoid the bias introduced by manual selection of synaptophysin1 - marked boutons , an automated detection algorithm was used . Fluorescence images stained for synaptophysin1 were subjected to an a ` - trous wavelet transformation with the level k ¼ 4 and detection level l d ¼ 1 . 0 ( Olivo - Marin , 2002 ) , resulting in a segmented mask image . Spots on mask images , each representing putative functional boutons , were identiﬁed , and only masks with areas between 4 and 20 pixels were accepted for calculating bouton ﬂuorescence intensities in all simultaneously recorded ﬂuorescence images . mAbp1 deﬁciency symptoms S Connert et al The EMBO Journal VOL 25 | NO 8 | 2006 & 2006 European Molecular Biology Organization 1620 Antibodies Polyclonal anti - SH3P7 antibody ( 88 - B2 ) and monoclonal anti - synapsinIa , Ib were described previously ( Larbolette et al , 1999 ; Giovedi et al , 2004 ) .
