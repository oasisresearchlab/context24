ABSTRACT DISSERTATION : Cognitive Processes Associated with Creativity : Scale Development and Validation STUDENT : Angela L . Miller DEGREE : Doctor of Philosophy COLLEGE : Teachers College DATE : March 2009 PAGES : 177 Based on empirical evidence from numerous studies involving the cognitive components of creativity training , the Cognitive Processes Associated with Creativity ( CPAC ) scale was developed to efficiently and directly address the processes of brainstorming , metaphorical and analogical thinking , perspective - taking , imagery , incubation , and flow . An online pilot study ( n = 226 ) and laboratory follow - up study ( n = 120 ) collected responses to the newly created CPAC scale and a variety of other creativity measures . Overall , the results of this research indicate that the CPAC scale has many sound psychometric qualities , and the scale assesses creativity as a process variable . The data from both studies provide evidence for the construct validity of the scale , with a relatively stable factor structure reflecting the underlying theoretical subscales . A lack of relationships between the CPAC scale , social desirability , and several demographic variables suggested some evidence for divergent validity . There is mixed evidence for concurrent validity , as scores on the CPAC were not significantly correlated with product - focused measures of creativity but were significantly correlated with other previously established self - report creativity instruments . Further investigation of these findings indicated that different conceptualizations and design issues may be the reason for the nonsignificant results , and additional research in this area is needed . A deeper exploration of the relationships between the various self - report subscales led to a more vivid description of each cognitive process included in the CPAC , laying the foundation for a theoretical understanding of the similarities and differences of these processes .
