Beekmans 1 , Elly M . Hol 2 , 3 , 4 , Wytse J . Wadman 4 & Davide Iannuzzi 1 The mechanical properties of brain tissue play a pivotal role in neurodevelopment and neurological disorders . Yet , at present , there is no consensus on how the different structural parts of the tissue contribute to its stiffness variations . Here , we have gathered depth - controlled indentation viscoelasticity maps of the hippocampus of acute horizontal live mouse brain slices . Our results confirm the highly viscoelestic nature of brain tissue . We further show that the mechanical properties are non - uniform and at least related to differences in morphological composition . Interestingly , areas with higher nuclear density appear to be softer than areas with lower nuclear density . Brain tissue consists of neuronal cell bodies , their processes ( dendrites and axons , myelinated or not , which form either sparse branches and arborizations or dense fiber bundles ) , the interconnecting extracellular brain matrix ( ECM ) , glial cells , blood vessels , and extracellular fluid . Each of these components as well as their joint organi - zation may have a different influence on the local mechanical properties of the tissue , which , in turn , regulate a wide variety of very relevant mechanotransduction phenomena . For instance , mechanical signals are known to play a role in multiple vital processes of neural cells 1 , 2 , whereas neuronal growth , neurite extension , arborization patterns , neuronal traction forces , and the stiffness of individual neurons and glial cells were all found susceptible to the stiffness of the substrate 3 – 11 . Furthermore , an abnormal mechanical environment ( emerging as a result of internal or external forces , changes in the composition of the ECM , or changes in osmotic conditions ) can dis - rupt normal brain function and neurodevelopment , and can alter progression of neurological disorders 12 – 14 . It is therefore commonly agreed that a deep knowledge of the correlation between brain composition and mechanical properties of the tissue would enable neuroscientists to shed light on how mechanotransduction phenomena con - tribute to the functioning of the brain . Furthermore , a quantitative assessment of the viscoelastic characteristics of the different regions of the brain could pave the way for the improvement of computational brain injury models 15 , the engineering of brain phantoms for surgical practise 16 , 17 , the design of mechanically matched brain implants 18 , and the production of soft substrates that could mimic different mechanical environments for investigations of stiffness - dependent neural stem cell differentiation 19 – 21 and neuronal and glial cell morphology 22 . Yet , at present , the relation between mechanical properties and cytoarchitecture is still largely unknown . Previous studies on brain mechanics have been mainly limited to the comparison between white and gray matter , with results that are either inconsistent or lack quantitative structure analysis 23 – 31 . Only recently , one study has shown that the mechanical properties correlate with myelin content in bovine brain 24 , while stiffness was found to scale with the cell nucleus area in spinal cord of mouse and retinal ruminant tissue 30 , 32 . Even though differences in mechanical properties of large hippocampal regions such as cornu ammonis ( CA ) fields and the dentate gyrus ( DG ) have been reported previously 33 – 37 , this set of data is not sufficient to completely determine the correlation between the morphological structure of the brain and its mechanical properties . 1 Department of Physics and Astronomy and LaserLab Amsterdam , Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam , De Boelelaan 1085 , 1081 HV , Amsterdam , The Netherlands . 2 Department of Translational Neuroscience , Brain Center Rudolf Magnus , University Medical Center Utrecht , 3584 CG , Utrecht , The Netherlands . 3 Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience , An Institute of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences , 1105 BA , Amsterdam , The Netherlands . 4 Center for Neuroscience , Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences , University of Amsterdam , 1098 XH , Amsterdam , The Netherlands .

Brain tissue is a highly viscoelastic , non - linear , anisotropic material 27 , 38 – 42 , and , because of its cellular heterogeneity , low stiffness , and rapid degrada - tion , it is one of the most difficult ( bio ) materials to mechanically test . Macroscopic tests ( such as shear rheology , compression testing , and tension testing ) can only measure the mechanical properties of large samples , and , for this reason , cannot provide information on the local features of the tissue . Atomic force microscope ( AFM ) indentation , on the contrary , makes use of a small radius tip to locally probe the mechanical response of a material to a compressive stress , and , therefore , seems to be more suitable to assess how the mechanical properties of the different regions of the brain may be influenced by the underlying morphological composition 43 . Unfortunately , the results reported in the literature do not always agree with each other , as witnessed by the wide range of stiff - ness values reported 39 , 42 , 44 . Tantalized by this challenge , we have explored whether a recently introduced mechanical testing technique , known as ferrule - top dynamic indentation 45 , 46 , could provide a better insight on the correlation between the composition of brain tissue and its viscoelastic properties . The technique used in our experiment is quite similar to AFM indentation . However , in our approach , the position of the cantilever is monitored by means of optical fiber interferometry rather than the optical triangulation technique used in AFM . As already showed in sev - eral papers 45 – 48 , this method is suited for the implementation of highly stable electromechanical feedback loops , which , in turn , guarantee better measurement protocols , including dynamic mechanical analysis at controlled indentation depth . In this paper , we demonstrate that , using our deep , depth - controlled indentation method , one can obtain high spatial resolution viscoelasticity map of a mouse hippocampus slice . The map clearly emphasizes how the different structural regions give rise to different mechanical properties . Our results further show that brain tissue appears stiffer as the indentation depth or frequency increases – a result that confirms the non - linear viscoelastic nature of the brain tissue . Finally , calculating the mean measured stiffness of eleven anatomical subregions , and comparing it with the estimated nuclear densities , we can infer that densely packed cell layers may actually have lower stiffness than more disperse ones – a result that seems to contradict the commonly accepted assumption that brain tissue stiffness is dominated by cell bodies 3 , 30 . Results Mechanical heterogeneity of hippocampus agrees with anatomical region boundaries . Viscoelasticity maps of live brain sections were obtained by means of ferrule - top depth - controlled inden - tation 45 , 46 . The image of one of the samples used in the experiment , along with a typical 50 × 50 μ m grid of indentation locations , can be seen in Fig . 1a . We refer the reader to the method section for further details on instrumentation and protocol . Figure 1b , c show the viscoelasticity maps ( E ′ = storage modulus ; E ″ = loss modulus ) over the DG and the proximal portion of CA3 field of the hippocampus obtained from a horizontal mouse ( 9 months old ) brain slice around 3 to 4 mm in the dorsal - ventral position . The representative maps were obtained with depth - controlled oscillatory ramp indentation strokes ( see Methods ) at an estimated strain of 9 % . Similar maps , albeit focused on smaller areas , were obtained in 8 other slices from ( 7 slices from 6 months old mice and 1 slice from 9 months old mouse ) out of 11 tested . As for the remaining 2 ( both obtained from 9 months old mice ) , the data looked rather scrambled and not reproducible , probably because the sample was not perfectly adhering on the substrate . In Fig . 1 , one can clearly identify multiple areas with distinctive mechanical features . The shape of these regions agrees well with the morphological heterogeneity of anatomical subregions ( see Fig . 1a ) , including the U - shaped structure of the molecular layer ( ML ) and of the granule cell layer ( GCL ) enclosing the hilus , and the laminar organization of strata ( layers ) : oriens ( SO ) , pyramidale ( SP ) , radiatum ( SR ) and lacunosum - moleculare ( SLM ) . Brain tissue is non - linear viscoelastic . To confirm that ferrule - top depth - controlled dynamic inden - tation is capable of capturing the non - linear viscoelastic nature of the brain tissue , we first pooled all the data obtained from the hippocampus and performed joint analysis ( i . e . , without subdivision into layers ) . The averaged storage and loss moduli over frequency ( obtained with the frequency sweep method ) and strain ( obtained with the oscillatory ramp method ) are shown in Fig . 2 . The frequency sweep data reveal a stiffening of the tissue with increasing indentation frequency , whereas the depth profiles from the oscillatory ramp testing show a stiffening with strain . Regional viscoelastic properties are reproducible . To test inter - animal variability of the mechanical properties measured in different brain areas , we developed a protocol to identify anatomical regions and indenta - tion locations . The coordinates of the XYZ micromanipulator were calibrated , prior to the measurements , using the image of the tip of the probe in the camera of the inverted microscope . At the end of the indentation measure - ment , each brain section was formalin - fixed and stained for nuclei and neurofilaments , which indicates the neu - ronal axons ( see Fig . 3 , Methods ) . Differences in cell densities and organization of axons , visualized in fluorescent images , allowed us to draw the morphologically accepted boundaries between anatomical regions and overlay them with the image of the slice from the inverted microscope . Next , each indentation location was assigned to the corresponding anatomical region and the viscoelastic properties were averaged over these regions . The layered composition of the cortex areas varied between slices and were treated as a single region . Figure 4 shows the value of E ′ at 7 . 3 % strain and 5 . 62 Hz frequency , averaged over all the slices , for each of the different regions identified with the staining procedure , plotted from the softest to the stiffest in increasing stiffness order ( as determined by the results obtained with the oscillatory ramp method ) . As expected from the viscoelasticity maps , the mechanical properties of the brain tissue appear highly heterogeneous . Both measuring methods ( oscillatory ramp and frequency sweep ) highlight the same trend in the mechanical properties of the www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 Scientific REPORTS | ( 2018 ) 8 : 12517 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 31035 - y different regions investigated , with the exception of the SLM region , where the frequency sweep method seems to indicate a decrease in stiffness that the oscillatory ramp does not detect . To compare the local storage modulus measured in 9 slices from 8 animals , we performed one - way ANOVA followed by post hoc test for each region ( Methods ) , where we used indentation measurements taken from various locations within the same region as testing samples . The results are indicated on top of Fig . 4 as a ratio between the number of significantly different pairs over the total number of pairs used for the comparison . Remarkably , only 17 % of the tested pairs were significantly different , especially if one considers that 57 % of these variations stems from the comparison of data obtained with different experimental methods ( frequency sweep versus oscillatory ramp ) . This result confirms that , in our experiments , there is a good inter - animal reproducibility of the results . Higher relative area of nuclei yields lower stiffness . Our results strongly suggest a relation between stiffness and underlying morphological structure . As an attempt to establish a more objective analysis of the results obtained , we chose to focus on the percentage of area covered by cell nuclei as a mean to distinguish the different morphological regions . Three slices fluorescently labeled for nuclei were used to obtain approximate Figure 1 .

Based on the estimation , regions were divided into two groups : low ( 2 . 4 – 28 . 2 % ) and high ( 74 . 5 – 92 . 3 % ) A rel ( Fig . 4 ) . The low density regions appear to be stiffer than high density ones . The only exception seems to be the alveus , containing mostly fibers . One may speculate that high density of fibers may decrease the stiffness of the tissue in low A rel regions . The high cell density region SP - CA3 also contains a lot of axons and has soft mechanical proper - ties , which agrees with the idea that regions with high density of axons are soft . However , it is important to stress Figure 2 .

Nevertheless , it seems clear that high nuclear density regions are softer than low density ones . Unfortunately , with data available , we cannot , as yet , draw robust conclusions on how this difference relates to more detailed morphological properties . For future reference , in Fig . 5 , we provide a map of the storage modulus of the different brain tissue regions as reconstructed with the weighted means of 9 slices . Discussion In this study , we have used a ferrule - top indentation approach to gather viscoelastic maps of mouse brain tissue ex vivo . The size of the indentation sphere and the depth of indentation were selected to ensure that the meas - urements could provide the tissue mechanical features of the subregional area of the tested sample . High spatial resolution ( 50 μ m ) of indentation mapping allowed us to find a clear correlation between indented regions and viscoelastic properties . The same relationship was reproduced on multiple slices by means of different testing method ( frequency sweep and oscillatory ramp ) . Our measurements show that both storage and loss moduli increase with strain . We can thus confirm that brain tissue is a non - linear material , as already reported in other studies 30 , 34 , 36 . Furthermore , performing the first localized frequency - domain indentation measurements on brain slices ever reported in the literature , we could Figure 4 .

In quantitative terms , it is interesting to note that , converting the averaged values of E ′ obtained in our measurements ( Fig . 2a ) to shear moduli G ′ by dividing E ′ by 2 ( 1 + ν ) ( where ν = 0 . 5 is the Poisson’s ratio of compressibility ) , one obtains values for G ′ of 0 . 5 – 0 . 8 ± 0 . 1 kPa , which is in good agreement with macroscopic ( i . e . , not localized ) frequency sweep measurements reported in the litera - ture 28 , 31 , 50 – 56 . A direct comparison with other local measurements is unfortunately not possible , because the latter have been either performed on different kind of samples ( different age , species , slicing direction ) or under very diverse indentation stroke protocols , which , because of the highly viscoelastic behavior of the material , give rise to very different results 23 – 26 , 29 , 33 – 36 , 57 . Our viscoelasticity maps on hippocampal subregions and the cortex further reveal that regions with higher cell body density corresponds to a softer tissue and vice versa . This is consistent with the study on single cor - tical neurons where soma has been found to be significantly softer than neurites 58 . However , our findings are in contrast with previous studies , which found a positive correlation between stiffness and cell nucleus area on the spinal cord of the adult mouse , retina of the ruminant and embryonic brain of Xenopus 3 , 30 , 32 . Furthermore , granular cell layer in coronal hippocampal slices of the juvenile rats was also shown to be stiffer than hilus 21 . While different CNS tissue composition might be the reason for the discrepancy between our results and those reported in the literature , it is worth stressing that our indentation protocol significantly differs with respect to that used in previous studies . The AFM system used in previous studies relies on small beads ( radius < 20 μ m ) and on a stroke that moves the probe at a constant speed of 10 μ m / s until a predefined maximum force is reached ( with the maximum force being on the order of several nN ) . We estimate that the contact radius must then be smaller than 10 μ m , with an indentation depth of less than 4 μ m . It is thus legitimate to ask whether this kind of AFM measurements probe the tissue properties or , actually , only indent the first layer of cells that lie on the surface which are also damaged during the slicing procedure 59 . Furthermore , the piezo - control testing used in AFM measurements results in different strain rates and indentation depth for different values of stiffness of the tissue indented ; under the same stroke protocol , a softer tissue will experience a higher strain rate and a larger indentation depth . In contrast , our deep , indentation - control testing protocol assures constant indentation depth and constant indentation speed . Furthermore , with indentation beads in the range of 60 – 105 μ m , strain of ~ 7 % , and indentation depth between 8 – 11 μ m ( which results in a contact radius between 20 and 40 μ m ) , we are sure to measure at the scale of the tissue . Therefore , we suggest that the opposite relationship between stiffness and areas of cell nuclei observed in our experiment might be at least partially due to the difference in the scale probed and / or in the very same testing method . Our data is not sufficient to causally explain why low nuclear density regions translate into stiffer tissue , mainly because there are many morphological factors in the lower nuclear density regions that need to be evaluated sep - arately and can all have a specific contribution to stiffness . At first , one may think that the increase of stiffness with the decrease of nuclear density be due to the role of the perineural nets ( PNNs ) . However , it has been showed that this component lacks fibrous proteins 60 , and , therefore , should not support mechanical loading . Another component that may play a role in the mechanical properties of the brain tissue is myelin , as it has been shown that brain stiffness increases with myelin content 24 , 36 . Yet , our results indicate that the bundle of myelinated fibers in the alveus and the tract of mossy fibers along the SP in the CA3 field are actually softer . One may thus speculate whether the mechanical properties of the brain tissue as observed in our experiment are rather due to the fact that regions with low nuclear density host a larger amount of sparsely distributed axons and dendrites under ten - sion 61 – 67 , which may in turn give rise to a stiffer material . To confirm or reject this hypothesis , it is imperative to perform new measurements that could directly correlate stiffness with axon density and orientation . Methods Sample preparation . C57Bl / 6 mice were purchased from Harlan ( Zeist , The Netherlands ) and sacrificed at an age of 6 or 9 months . All experiments were performed in accordance with protocols and guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( UvA - DEC ) operating under standards set by EU Directive 2010 / 63 / EU . All efforts were made to minimize the suffering and number of animals . The mice were decapitated , the brain was removed from the skull and stored in ice - cold ACSF containing ( in mM ) : 120 NaCl , 3 . 5 KCl , 5 MgSO 4 , 1 . 25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 2 . 5 CaCl 2 , 25 NaHCO 3 , and 10 glucose oxygenated with 95 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2 ( ~ 310 mOsmol / kg and ~ pH 7 . 4 ) . Slices were cut in a horizontal plane with a thickness of approximately 300 μ m using a VT1200S vibratome ( Leica Biosystems , Nussloch , Germany ) . Afterwards , a single brain tissue slice was placed in a perfu - sion chamber maintained at ~ 20 °C and supplied with carbogen saturated ACSF solution at 1 ml / min flow rate ( gear pump MCP - Z standard , Ismatec ) . Lower than physiological mouse temperature was chosen to prolong the viability of the slice . The glass bottom of the chamber was coated with 0 . 05 % polyethylenimine for the adhesion with the sample , which was gently mounted from the top with a 2 mm spaced harp to ensure the stability . After acclimatization for 1 h , indentation measurements were performed within 8 h . This time interval was chosen as the best compromise between number of measurements and overall durations of the experiment . Imaging and immunofluorescence . An inverted microscope ( Nikon TMD - Diaphot , Nikon Corporation , Japan ) was used to image the slice during the measurements with a 2x magnification objective ( Nikon Plan 2X , Nikon Corporation , Japan ) . Images were recorded with a CCD camera ( WAT - 202B , Watec ) . After the meas - urements , slices were fixed in 4 % PFA overnight at 4 °C . The sections were washed 3 × 10 min in PBS solution ( 0 . 01 M , pH = 7 . 4 ) and subsequently blocked for 2 h with 10 % normal donkey serum ( NDS ) , 0 . 25 % Triton in PBS solution . After , slices were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody against neurofilament 160 kDa ( NN18 N5264 , Sigma Aldrich , 1 : 1000 dilution ) , 3 % NDS and 0 . 25 % Triton in PBS solution . Consequently , slices were washed 3 × 10 min in PBS solution and incubated for 2 h in PBS solution with DNA stain ( Hoechst 33342 , www . nature . com / scientificreports / 7 Scientific REPORTS | ( 2018 ) 8 : 12517 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 31035 - y Invitrogen , dilution 1 : 2000 ) , the secondary antibody Cy3 - conjugated donkey anti - mouse IgG ( Jackson Immuno Research , 1 : 1400 dilution ) , 1 % NDS and 0 . 025 % Triton . Finally , sections were washed 3 × 10 min in PBS and mounted with a glass coverslip in Vectashield ( Vector Laboratories ) . Fluorescent images were obtained with Leica DMRE fluorescence microscope ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) and overlaid with the previously obtained bright - field images to identify anatomical regions of measured locations . Immunofluorescently - labeled slices were too thick for objective calculation of cell density and , thus , approximate percentage of area covered by nuclei was estimated for each region : = A A A , ( 1 ) rel nuclei total where A nuclei is the area covered by nuclei in the region and A total is the total area of that region ( processed with image J ) . Dynamic indentation setup and measurement protocol . Horizontal mouse brain slices from 3 to 4 mm of dorsal - ventral positions of hippocampus ( Fig . 6d ) were submerged in a perfusion chamber assembled on the microscope , stabilized with a 2 mm spaced harp , and supplied with a constant flow of carbogenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( ACSF ) . Measurements were carried out on 9 slices from eight mice of which 6 were 6 months old and 2 – 9 months old . The indentation lines were selected to cross the DG and the subiculum or the CA3 field of hippocampus ( n ≥ 66 measurement points per slice ) . In addition , indentations on cortex were performed on 5 of the same slices adjacent to subiculum , in parallel lines between outer and inner layers ( n ≥ 21 measurement points per slice ) . A ferrule - top force transducer 45 , consisting of a micromachined cantilever spring with optical fiber readout , was mounted on a 3D printed holder screwed to a Z - piezoelectric actuator ( PI p - 603 . 5S2 , Physik Instrumente ) . The single - mode fiber of the readout was coupled to an interferometer ( OP1550 , Optics11 ) , where the interfer - ence signal was directly translated into cantilever deflection . Indentation depth control was implemented through a feedback loop , based on the error signal of cantilever deflection ( Fig . 6 , for more details see 46 ) . The piezoelectric actuator with the probe was mounted on a XYZ micromanipulator ( PatchStar , Scientifica ) for automatic mapping of mechanical properties . Indentation mapping was performed in parallel lines , with 59 – 476 points per slice . Distance between two adjacent locations were in the range of 50 – 160 μ m , which assured that deformed areas do not overlap . A custom - written LabVIEW software ( National Instruments ) was used to process signals and to control the instrument through a data acquisition card ( PCIe - 6361 , National Instruments ) . Ferrule - top probes of 0 . 2 – 0 . 5 N / m stiffness and 60 – 105 μ m bead radius were selected for these experiments and calibrated according to the method we recently introduced 68 . Two indentation - controlled profiles were selected for the characterization of depth and frequency dependent viscoelasticity : oscillatory ramp loading ( OR ) and equilibrium frequency sweep ( FS ) . Figure 7 shows the typical curves of the controlled - indentation and load response . Depth - controlled oscillatory ramp indentations ( Fig . 7a ) had small 0 . 2 μ m oscillations at 5 . 62 Hz fre - quency superimposed on top of a loading ramp at 0 . 01 strain rate estimated by ε ε ∆  ~ t / . Depth - controlled equi - librium frequency sweep measurements ( Fig . 7b ) consisted of the loading part up to 10 μ m with 10 μ m / s indentation speed , followed by 30 s stress relaxation period to reach mechanical equilibrium and series of small Figure 6 .

The approach speed was set to 30 μ m / s , the surface of the sample was determined , and an indentation - controlled feedback was trig - gered at approximate load of 15 nN , which resulted in the initial uncontrolled 1 – 3 μ m indentation depth , which was later corrected in post processing procedures . Data analysis . Raw data was analyzed with custom - written MATLAB functions . The Hertz model was used to fit an initial loading data up to the cantilever threshold value to obtain the true surface position : F E R h 4 3 1 , ( 2 ) 2 3 ν = − where F is the load , E is an elastic modulus , ν is the Poisson’s ratio of compressibility ( we assume that brain is incompressible ν = 0 . 5 ) , h is the indentation depth . This allows us to correct the indentation depth h and to esti - mate the strain for measurements with probes of different radius : ε = 0 . 2 × a / R , where contact radius was esti - mated as = a hR varying between 22 – 39 μ m . Strain of 7 . 3 % was selected for comparative analysis in order to fulfill small strain approximation ε < 0 . 08 69 . While contact adhesion was observed as a pull - off force during retraction , it was not taken into account , as we assume that , under deep indentation conditions , the nominal area dominates over the actual one . The sinusoidal oscillations were fit to cosine function , obtained amplitudes and phases were used to calculate the storage and loss moduli E ′ and E ″ 46 , which is a measure of elasticity and viscosity , respectively : ω ν δ π ′ − = E F h cos A ( ) 1 2 1 , ( 3 ) 2 0 0 ω ν δ π ″ − = E F h sin A ( ) 1 2 1 ( 4 ) 2 0 0 where ω is the frequency , F 0 and h 0 are the amplitudes of oscillatory load and indentation depth , respectively , δ is the phase - shift between the recorded indentation and load oscillations , A = π a 2 is the contact area . The contact area changes with the depth during oscillatory ramp , thus every 5 cycles were used for fitting and averaged indentation depth was used for the calculation of E ′ and E ″ . Finally , all cosine fits with the R 2 ≤ 0 . 7 and measurements which started in contact were rejected . Normality of data distribution was tested with Shapiro - Wilk test ( n ≥ 3 ) . In case of normal distribution , statis - tical differences between multiple groups were investigated with one - way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test to achieve 95 % confidence level ( α = 0 . 05 ) . For non - normally distributed data , Kruskal - Wallis ANOVA test followed by Dunn’s post hoc test with Š id á k correction for α 1 = 1 − ( 1 − α ) 1 / k was used to compare multiple groups .
