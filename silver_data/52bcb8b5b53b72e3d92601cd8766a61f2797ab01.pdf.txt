In this paper , the network motif existing in different IEEE test systems and real power grids are identified , and the consistency between the structural feature of motif and power system design for reliable power supply is revealed . By incorporating the transmission line margin into the procedure of finding significant motifs , the risk of cascading overloads due to insufficient transmission capacity and the decrease of connectivity of the power network is reflected by the occurrence of certain motifs in the power network . Through the simulation of cascading failures along the continuous increase of load demand and random line failures , different phases in the evolution of cascading failures are defined , and the patterns in the occurrence of motifs corresponded to different phases are identified . The performance of network motifs as a warning signal for higher risk of large outages is also tested under continuous line / node removal scenario . Test results show that the occurrence of motifs can be a good supplement to the EENS to describe the risk of outages .

I NTRODUCTION The ever - taken key reliability principles of security and adequacy have led to the development of one of the most reliable and complex infrastructures of the last century . As the center nerve of the functioning of other infrastructures , the importance of the power network is self - evident , and tremendous efforts have been made to improve its reliability . However , under the restricted power markets , modern power systems have the tendency to operate under heavy loading conditions . In the meantime , the integration of large amount of intermittent renewable energy in the transmission level and the distribution level intensifies the variation in power flows . Modern power system will inevitably face the contradiction between raising the stability margin and improving the operational economy . Under these circumstances , increasing the operators’ awareness of the status for making better operating strategies will help to reduce the catastrophic costs of large blackouts . Therefore , there are great needs to perform the real - time warning of the risk of large blackouts and intervene its propagation . Since the happening of several large blackouts worldwide , researchers with various backgrounds ( such as power system , mathematics , statistic physics , non - linear dynamics , etc . ) have performed studies with various perspectives on the evolution and intervention of cascading blackouts [ 1 ] [ 2 ] . Applications other than the traditional electrical engineering methods include methods base on complex network theory [ 3 ] , Self - Organized Criticality [ 4 ] , and Phase Transition [ 5 ] [ 6 ] . Except for the destroy of multiple transmission and distribution facilities due to extreme weather condition or terrorist attacks , a systemic outage is most probably caused through cascading overloads and cascading voltage collapse . A compromised connectivity is one of the reasons , because the local failure cannot be eliminated quickly through subsidiary inputs from the broader system . Outages happen because loads at the end lose their power supply . Ref . [ 7 ] and [ 8 ] have investigated the effect of the topology of power systems and cascading failures by spectral radius , the effective graph resistance , and algebraic connectivity . However , most studies omit the fact that connectivity is embodied by both the topology and the function . When the transmission capacity of the system is limited , although the system is topologically connected , the reliable power supply guaranteed by the capability of transferring power flow through the connected network is already compromised or damaged . Studies [ 9 ] [ 10 ] on scale - free network found that the network has a scale - free structure at the macro level , but it shows regularity in its micro structure . Network Motif [ 10 ] is one of these specific micro structures . It has been proved to be vital for the realization of the function of real networks . Ref . [ 11 ] studied the collapse of the interbank network in Holland through the data of 1998 to 2008 . There study proved that the increase of the significance of a specific network motif captured the risk in the operation of the interbank network . Inspired by the research in [ 11 ] , we analyze the topology of different IEEE test systems and a real power grid in this paper (cid:0) The relationship between the structural features of The work is support by National Science Research Foundation of China ( 51107040 ) . (cid:28)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:16)(cid:20)(cid:16)(cid:24)(cid:22)(cid:27)(cid:25)(cid:16)(cid:21)(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:16)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:20)(cid:26)(cid:18)(cid:7)(cid:22)(cid:20)(cid:17)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:3)(cid:139)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:44)(cid:40)(cid:40)(cid:40) different motifs and the general design rules for reliable power supply ( section II ) is studied . According to the mechanism of cascading overloads , we modify the procedure of finding significant motifs by incorporating the transmission line margin ; therefore , the significance of motifs ( Zscore ) can reflect the changes on the connectivity of power networks . In section III , we introduce firstly about the patterns in the variation of Zscores correspondent to the phase transitions of cascading outages along the continuous load increase . Then the effectiveness of network motif as a tool to indicate the risk of large outages are tested under other failure scenarios . We conclude the contribution of this paper in section IV . II . T HE APPLICATION OF M OTIFS IN P OWER N ETWORKS A . Network Motifs Network Motif is defined as the specific pattern of interconnections among nodes . They are the basic building blocks of complex networks and vital for the fulfillment of the function of the complex network . As given in the left part of Figure 1 , the patterns of connecting 3 nodes are given in red dashed lines . Network motifs are found in networks from biochemistry , neurobiology , ecology , and engineering . Different networks , such as food webs or engineering networks , have different motif sets which reflect the underlying processes in the function of the networks [ 10 ] . All patterns in 3 - node interconnections and 4 - node interconnections in IEEE - test system and a real regional power grid are also given in Figure 1 . The ID of each pattern is given next to each pattern according to the naming rules proposed in [ 9 ] . 06 36 12 38 344 392 204 394 92 408 904 2184 2186 Figure 1 . 3 - node and 4 - node Network Motifs . The definition of the ID of the Motif is given by [ 9 ] . The interconnection patterns will be considered to be statistically significant when the following conditions are met . i . The probability P , the pattern appear in a randomized network an equal or greater number of times than in the real network , is lower than a cutoff value . For example , P = 0 . 01 [ 10 ] . ii . The pattern occurs in the real network at least 4 times with completely different sets of nodes [ 10 ] . iii . The pattern appears in a real network more frequently than in an ensemble of random networks to some extent . Normally , this condition holds if the significane of the pattern is greater than 0 . The significance of the pattern i can be examined by the Zscore ( Standard score ) as given in below . (cid:1852) (cid:3046)(cid:3030)(cid:3042)(cid:3045)(cid:3032) (cid:1861) (cid:1568) (cid:3025)(cid:2879)(cid:1731)(cid:3025)(cid:1732) (cid:3097)(cid:4670)(cid:3025)(cid:4671) ( 1 ) where X is the number of occurrence of motif i in a real network . (cid:1731)(cid:1850)(cid:1732) is the expected value of the occurance of motif i in a set of random networks , where each node has the same number of incoming and outgoing edges as the node in the real network [ 10 ] . (cid:592)(cid:4670)(cid:27)(cid:4671) is the standard deviation of the number of appearance of motif i in the abovementioned random networks . However , the method given above has its limitation : patterns that are functionally important but not statistically significant could exist [ 10 ] .

In the power system design , multiple circuits from sending end to the receiving end are typical designs to guarantee the reliability of power supply . In Figure 2 , the 3 - node motifs ID6 , ID36 , and ID38 , as well as 4 - node motif ID904 are the case . The significance of ID36 and ID6 are smaller than zero because in the randomized network with nodes of the same number of incoming and outgoing edges as those in power networks , the number of appearance of them are larger than those in power networks . Moreover , the pattern of ID38 is a combination of ID6 and ID36 . Except for ID904 , other 4 - node motifs , such as ID92 , ID344 , ID392 , ID394 , ID408 , and ID2186 , are built on top of ID38 . Therefore , the significance of those 4 - node motifs , ID6 , and ID36 can all be reflected by the significance of ID38 . In the case study , we take IEEE - 30 bus system as an example for detail analysis . Because of the size of the test system , the number of ID904 ( given in Figure 2 ) cannot meet the requirement of the second condition for a motif to be considered significant . Therefore , ID38 is the only significant network motif for IEEE - 30 bus system and being analyzed in the following section . B . The applicaition of Network Motifs in power network as a measure of connectivity One of typical scenarios in cascading blackouts is that the redistribution of the power flow after failures of other (cid:28)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:16)(cid:20)(cid:16)(cid:24)(cid:22)(cid:27)(cid:25)(cid:16)(cid:21)(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:16)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:20)(cid:26)(cid:18)(cid:7)(cid:22)(cid:20)(cid:17)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:3)(cid:139)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:44)(cid:40)(cid:40)(cid:40) components could overload other transmission lines and cause the tripping of the overloaded lines because of the relays’ hidden failure or the sagging of the lines . When multiple lines are tripped , the connectivity of the network is compromised (cid:0) Load - shedding at multiple nodes may happen . However , the original definition of network motif only considers the topology and the direction of power flow , not the loading level of lines . According to the above scenario , we consider the line’s capability of carrying extra power flow when we determine the significance of the motifs . We redefine the component a ij in the adjacent matrix A to be : (cid:1853) (cid:3036)(cid:3037) (cid:3404) (cid:3421)(cid:883)(cid:481) (cid:1861)(cid:1858)(cid:3)(cid:882) (cid:3407) (cid:3007)(cid:3039)(cid:3042)(cid:3050) (cid:3284)(cid:3285) (cid:3007)(cid:3040)(cid:3028)(cid:3051) (cid:3284)(cid:3285) (cid:3407) (cid:882)(cid:484)(cid:891) (cid:882)(cid:481) (cid:1857)(cid:1864)(cid:1871)(cid:1857) ( 2 ) where Flow ij / Fmax ij is the fractional line loading of the line connecting node i and j . The threshold of loading level can be set according to the robustness of the system . For the simulation in our study , it is set to be 0 . 9 . When the fractional line loading on a line , which is part of the ID38s , is above the threshold , the capability of the line to provide an alternative path for the power flow to the receiving end has already been compromised , and the “functional connectivity” of the power grid is decreased . By setting the correspondent components of lines in matrix A to be 0 , the decrease of the connectivity of the network can be captured by the decrease of the Zscore of certain motif . Figure 2 . IEEE - 30 bus system . The ID38s ( red ) , ID904s ( light red ) , and the betweeness of lines ( blue ) are given by different colors . The betweeness is indicated in descending order , where “1” indicates a line with the highest betweeness . The topology of modern power network is more complicated with the growth of the size of the network . In the meantime , the changes of the operational condition will change the importance of different lines . With the proposed method , the supervision of the transmission system will be simplified to be the supervision of the changes of Zscores of certain motifs . The complexity and difficulty of online monitoring is significantly decreased . III . S IMULATION AND ANALYSIS M ETHOD We use a simplified version of Oak - PSERC - Alaska ( OPA ) model [ 4 ] for this study . OPA is a well - accepted model for the study of cascading blackouts from long - term perspective . By removing part of the slow - dynamic that is related to the upgrade of the transmission capacity and generation capacity , the model is applicable for online application . OPA is built on top of Monte Carlo simulation . Two extra modules , load increase and variation and cascading overload tripping , are added to study the risk of cascading blackouts . Detailed introduction of OPA is given in [ 4 ] . We simulate the stressing of the power network by continuous load increase and unexpected power flow variation by load variation and component failure . In the model , load at the t th iteration can be calculated by a daily ( each iteration ) increase plus a variation . All load nodes are divided into several zones . Loads in the same zone vary in the same pattern , while loads in different zones vary differently [ 4 ] . We replace the DC optimal power flow in the original OPA with AC optimal power flow for future studies related to voltages . Because the size of the IEEE - 30 test system is small , the computational burden caused by the replacement is acceptable . The objective function is minimizing the cost of generation and load - shedding . All generators are considered to have the same generation techniques and quadratic cost functions for simplicity . The constraints include nodal power balance by AC power flow , voltage constraints at node , and line flow constraints . In each simulation , heavy loaded lines due to the redistribution of power flow are tripped with a probability to simulate the process of cascading overload tripping . Parameters taken in the simulation model include 0 . 005 for the probability of initial line failure , 0 . 25 for the probability of cascading line tripping , and 1 . 00006 for the daily load increase . The transmission margin at the beginning of the simulation is 2 . IV . A NALYSIS OF THE S IMULATION R ESULT IEEE - 30 bus system is taken as the test system in this study . Simulation of probabilistic line failure and the corresponding cascading failure are performed under 1 ) continuous load increase for the test system and 2 ) line removals and node removals . In the second scenario , lines or nodes are removed one by one according to their betweeness in a descending order . The betweeness of line i or node i is defined as the number of shortest paths between a pair of nodes through line i or node i . Betweeness gives an information of the importance of the line or the node [ 3 ] . In power system application , the path with the smallest reactance is regarded as the shortest path . Table 2 The betweeness of lines and nodes in descending order Betweeness 8 lines / nodes in descending order of line 19 - 23 , 5 - 6 , 23 - 24 , 24 - 25 , 15 - 16 , 4 - 12 , 25 - 27 , 1 - 2 of node 2 , 12 , 24 , 23 , 15 , 10 , 27 , 22 A . Patterns in the variation of Zscores of ID38 under continous load increase scenario We take IEEE - 30 bus system as a test system and perform a simulation of 10000 iterations . Along the simulation , the demand of the system is continuously increasing in a way introduced in section III . The percentage load shedding ( loadshed % ) recorded in each iteration is given in Figure 3 ( A ) . (cid:28)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:16)(cid:20)(cid:16)(cid:24)(cid:22)(cid:27)(cid:25)(cid:16)(cid:21)(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:16)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:20)(cid:26)(cid:18)(cid:7)(cid:22)(cid:20)(cid:17)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:3)(cid:139)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:44)(cid:40)(cid:40)(cid:40) According to the maximum loadshed % and the minimum loadshed % , we define 3 phases that the system undergoes along the simulation . Phase 1 is from the beginning of the simulation to the 3554 th iteration . In this phase , the system is robust to most disturbances . Phase 2 is from the 3555 th iteration to 9238 th iteration . In this phase , the maximum loadshed % starts to increase along the load increase , while the minimum loashed % is the same as that in phase 1 . Therefore , a triangle area ( indicated in red line ) that is full of outages with various scales can be observed . Phase 3 is from the 9239 th iteration to the end of the simulation . In this phase , the most significant feature is that the minimum loadshed % starts to increase . 10000 8000 6000 4000 2000 1 4 3 2 1 0 Time Z i d38 2258 3456 8495 B IEEE - 30 system Figure 3 . Fractional load - shedding of IEEE - 30 test system ( A ) by simulation ; The variation of the Zscore of Motif ID38 ( Zid38 ) along the simulation of IEEE - 30 test system ( B ) . The capacity margin at the transition point of phase 1 to phase 2 and phase 2 to phase 3 are 1 . 43 ( the loading level is about 1 / 1 . 43 = 0 . 7 ) and 1 . 02 , respectively . The transition point of phase 1 to phase 2 is similar to the “critical loading” given in Fig . 3 and Fig . 6 in [ 4 ] . At the critical loading point , the mean number of components failed in Fig . 3 of [ 4 ] and expected energy unserved in Fig . 6 of [ 4 ] start to increase sharply . While in our study , the maximum loadshed % starts to increase . In response to these 3 phases , in Figure 3 ( B ) , we can see that the frequency of the Zscore of ID38 ( Zid38 ) with different value varies at different load levels . Zid38 has 7 possible values , including 4 . 09 , 3 . 18 , 2 . 27 , 1 . 36 , 0 . 45 , - 0 . 45 and - 1 . 37 , corresponding to the occurrence of Motif ID38 from 6 to 0 . During the entire simulation period , 6 of them appears ( - 1 . 37 never appears ) . Along the increase of the average load , Zid38 does not monotonically decrease and could be any value of a subset of the 6 abovementioned values . The reason is that , in each iteration , the power flow varies due to the load variation about the average load demand and probabilistic failures . However , because of the simulation length and the size of the plot , the details of the variation in Zid38 in Figure 3 ( B ) is covered . We magnify the variation of Zid38 from the 2258 th iteration to the 2278 th iteration and provide the details in Figure 3 ( B ) . At the beginning of the simulation , Zid38 with a value of 1 . 36 , 0 . 45 , and - 0 . 45 seldom happens . After the 3456 th iteration , iterations with Zid38 = 0 . 45 start to appear . After the 8495 th iteration , no iteration has Zid38 = 4 . 18 or Zid38 = 3 . 18 . We perform the same simulation on IEEE - 57 test systems and similar pattern on loadshed % and Zscore of ID 38 can be observed . When the second ( or the third ) least value of Zid38 frequently appears , the operational “stress” due to the probabilistic failure and cascades enters phase 2 . When the largest ( or the second largest ) value of Zid38 appears less frequently and even disappears , the operational stress enters phase 3 . The Zscore of ID38 changes earlier than the phase transition happens , therefore it can be used as a warning signal . B . The performance of Network Mortif as warning signals in line / node removal scenario In power system operation , the demand does not increase continuously . At each load level , the operational stress of the system could be increased when several lines fail consecutively . Therefore , in this subsection , we observe how the number of appearance of ID38 changes along the removal of lines and nodes . Lines and nodes are removed according to their betweeness in a descending order . The simulation is performed at the base load level . The results are given in Figure 4 and Figure 5 . Figure 4 . The changes of the no . of network Motif ID38s ( left ) and the EENS ( right ) along the no . of lines removed . The lines are removed according to their betweeness in a descending order . Figure 5 . The changes of the no . of network Motif ID38s ( left ) and the EENS ( right ) along the no . of nodes removed . The nodes are removed according to their betweeness in a descending order . As shown in Figure 2 , 6 out of 8 lines with higher betweeness ( marked by blue number ) are part of the motif ID38 , too . In common power system upgrade , new lines will be built to lower the loading level of existing lines . Therefore , new lines tend to be alternatives to the existing lines and tend to form ID 38 , ID 36 or ID 904 with existing lines . In the meantime , the line with the highest betweeness is the line with 10000 8000 6000 4000 2000 1 0 . 18 0 . 16 0 . 14 0 . 12 0 . 10 0 . 08 0 . 06 0 . 04 0 . 02 0 . 00 Time L o a d s h e d ( % ) 3554 9238 A IEEE - 30 system RobustPhase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 - 2 . 00 - 1 . 00 0 . 00 1 . 00 2 . 00 3 . 00 4 . 00 5 . 00 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Z s c o r e o f I D 38 No . of lines removed 8000 10000 12000 14000 16000 18000 20000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 EE N S ( M W h / y ) No . of lines removed - 2 . 00 - 1 . 00 0 . 00 1 . 00 2 . 00 3 . 00 4 . 00 5 . 00 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Z s c o r e o f I D 38 No . of nodes removed 0 50000 100000 150000 200000 250000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 EE N S ( M W h / y ) No . of nodes removed (cid:28)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:16)(cid:20)(cid:16)(cid:24)(cid:22)(cid:27)(cid:25)(cid:16)(cid:21)(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:16)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:20)(cid:26)(cid:18)(cid:7)(cid:22)(cid:20)(cid:17)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:3)(cid:139)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:44)(cid:40)(cid:40)(cid:40) the smallest reactance ; then , it is most probably the line with the highest loading . Therefore , the removal of lines with higher betweeness will decrease the number of ID38s of the power network . In IEEE - 30 test system , 2 lines that have higher betweeness are not part of ID38s . They are lines connecting different zones , and their betweeness are decided by the distribution of loads and generations . The number of ID38s is monotonic descending along the removal of lines . After the removal of the first 3 lines , the number of ID38 is decreased from 6 to 4 ( Figure 4 left ) . Because of the robustness of the system , the EENS of the system under the same fault scenario remains the same until the removal of 5 lines . Therefore , the changes on the number of ID38 ( Zscore ) can be used as a warning signal for the operator to decide if the system is approaching a point , above which the risk of having larger outages is increasing . Figure 5 gives the changes of the connectivity and the EENS of the system along the removal of nodes with higher betweeness . For a system as small as IEEE - 30 bus system , removing node is a much stronger disturbance than removing lines because when a node is removed , several lines will be removed . Therefore , the EENS of the system monotonically increase along the removing of nodes . The network motif also monotonically decrease . In this case , the network motif can still act as an index to indicate the risk of the outages because the trend of the variation is consistent with that of the EENS . However , the calculation of EENS needs Monte Carlo simulation with multiple iterations ( in our study , we run the simulation with 2000 iterations ) , while the calculation of the Zscore of ID38 can be performed real - time based on the power flow data . Therefore , the proposed method has advantages for online evaluation of the risk of large outages . V . C ONCLUSION Increasing the resilience of the power system could be implemented either by making the system stronger or by making the system smarter [ 12 ] . The latter needs the aid of advanced tools or algorithms to increase the awareness of the operator through large amounts of data collected by an on - line monitoring system . This paper studied the potential of “network motif” as an indicator of the risk of cascading outages due to the damage of the connectivity of power grid . We analyzed the topology of the network and found that two motifs , ID38 and ID904 , are significant in different IEEE test systems ( IEEE - 30 , 57 , and 118 ) and real power grid ( a regional power grid with about 200 buses at 220kV and above ) . The connection of these two motifs are consistent with the basic design rules for reliable power supply . Focusing on the mechanism of cascading overload , we introduced the transmission margin into the procedure to identify the occurrence of “active” motif ID38 and ID904 . Therefore , the actual connectivity of the power network can be reflected by the significance of motif ID38 and ID904 . We first introduced the simulation about the evolution of the cascading failures in IEEE - 30 test system under continuous load increase and probabilistic line failures . Three phases can be observed in the evolution of the fractional load - shedding . The pattern observed in the variation of Zscore of ID38 are consistent with the development of the fractional load - shedding . The variation of the Zscore of ID38 can give warning signal when the system is about to enter a phase with higher risk of large outages . We also simulated the increasing of the operational “stress” by continuous line / node removal at a certain load level . The conventional reliability index , EENS , was taken as a comparison . Test results showed that the variation of Zscore can act as an index of increasing risk of outages before it is can be observed by EENS . The calculation of Zscores needs power flow on each line , transmission capacity limits , and the topology of the power network . This information can be readily obtained from the modern data acquisition system . Future work will focus on the investigation of the proposed method in real power networks under more complicated failure scenarios . A CKNOWLEDGMENT Hui Ren thanks I . Dobson , B . A . Carreras , V .
