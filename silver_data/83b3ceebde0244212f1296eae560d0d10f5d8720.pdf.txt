Using immunogold electron microscopy of plasma membrane sheets coupled with spatial point pattern analysis , we have visualized morphologically featureless microdomains , including lipid rafts , in situ and at high resolution . We ﬁnd that an inner - plasma membrane lipid raft marker displays cholesterol - dependent clustering in microdomains with a mean diameter of 44 nm that occupy 35 % of the cell surface . Cross - linking an outer - leaﬂet raft protein results in the redistribution of inner leaﬂet rafts , but they retain their modular structure . Analysis of Ras L microlocalization shows that inactive H - ras is distributed between lipid rafts and a cholesterol - independent micro - domain . Conversely , activated H - ras and K - ras reside predominantly in nonoverlapping , cholesterol - independent microdomains . Galectin - 1 stabilizes the association of activated H - ras with these nonraft microdomains , whereas K - ras clustering is supported by farnesylation , but not geranylgeranylation . These results illustrate that the inner plasma membrane comprises a complex mosaic of discrete microdomains . Differential spatial localization within this framework can likely account for the distinct signal outputs from the highly homologous Ras proteins . Introduction Current models of the plasma membrane predict the existence of a patchwork of specialized microdomains coordinating a variety of cellular functions including signaling , cell adhe - sion , and membrane trafficking . A well - characterized plasma membrane microdomain is the lipid raft comprised of sphingo - lipids packed together with cholesterol , although the existence of other lipid - based microdomains has also been proposed ( Simons and Ikonen , 1997 ; Brown and London , 1998 ; Kurzchalia and Parton , 1999 ; Murray et al . , 1999 ) . Sophisti - cated fluorescence techniques strongly support the existence of outer - leaflet plasma membrane lipid rafts ( Varma and Mayor , 1998 ; Pralle et al . , 2000 ) , but rafts need to be cross - linked in order to visualize clustering of putative inner leaflet raft - associated proteins ( Harder et al . , 1998 ) . A major diffi - culty with accurately characterizing lipid rafts and other cell surface microdomains is imaging resolution resulting in relatively large discrepancies in estimates of microdomain parameters and composition , dependent on the techniques used to probe them ( Kenworthy et al . , 2000 ; Anderson and Jacobson , 2002 ) . In addition , the interactions of signaling proteins with rafts are dynamic and regulated . The tools available to accurately assign proteins to specific domains in intact membranes are limited ( Simons and Toomre , 2000 ) . The microlocalization of some signaling proteins has been visually mapped at high resolution with electron microscopy . However , the assignments have been limited to morpholog - ically identifiable plasma membrane structures such as caveolae ( Mineo et al . , 1999 ; Prior et al . , 2001 ) or osmiophilic patches ( Wilson et al . , 2000 , 2001 ) , all of which account for a relatively minor fraction of the total cell surface . Therefore , in this study , we investigated whether electron microscopic techniques can also be used to assign proteins to morpholog - ically featureless surface domains . Ras GTPases play critical roles in transducing extracellular signals ( Campbell et al . , 1998 ) . The Ras isoforms ( H - ras , N - ras , and K - ras ) are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells , and although highly homologous , these proteins generate different signal outputs ( Bos , 1989 ; Umanoff et al . , 1995 ; Koera et al . , 1997 ; Yan et al . , 1998 ) . This biochemical diversity may result from differential lateral segregation of Ras proteins The online version of this report includes supplemental material . Address correspondence to John F .

We have di - rectly investigated this hypothesis by mapping the cell surface distributions of Ras proteins at high resolution . Results and discussion Ras microlocalization was examined on intact 2 - D sheets of apical plasma membrane , ripped off from adherent cells di - rectly onto EM grids ( Sanan and Anderson , 1991 ; Parton and Hancock , 2001 ) . First , we investigated the distributions of GFP fused to the minimal plasma membrane targeting motifs of H - ras , GFP - tH ( Fig . 1 ) . GFP - tH , targeted by a combination of palmitoylation and a farnesylated CAAX motif , is an excellent lipid raft marker because even on high expression , it is localized exclusively to low density fractions on sucrose gradients ( Prior et al . , 2001 ) . We visualized GFP - tH in plasma membrane sheets with anti - GFP – 5 nm gold ( Fig . 1 a ) . GFP - tH is extensively distributed in small , mor - phologically featureless patches . To analyze the complete gold patterns as rigorously and objectively as possible , we used statistical methods for point pattern analysis that are well established , but rarely used in cell biology . Ripley’s K - function ( Ripley , 1977 , 1979 ; Philimonenko et al . , 2000 ) evaluates an exhaustive map of all interparticle distances over the study area and compares the observed distribution with that expected from complete spatial randomness ( CSR ) . * The analysis , which focuses on the second - order properties of the gold pattern , has the advantage that it ana - lyzes spatial structure at multiple ranges simultaneously ( Ripley , 1977 , 1979 ; see Materials and methods and sup - plementary data ) . K - function analysis of GFP - tH sheets shows that the gold pattern is clustered ( Fig . 1 c , red line ) , i . e . , the curve shows significant positive deviation from the L ( r ) (cid:2) r (cid:3) 0 value expected for a random point pattern . The maximum devia - tion of the GFP - tH L ( r ) (cid:2) r curve from CSR occurs at a ra - dius of 22 nm . From these data , we can model the size and distribution of GFP - tH microdomains ( Figs . S1 b and S2 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200209091 / DC1 ) ; we estimate that they are domains with mean radius of 22 (cid:4) 4 nm that occupy 35 % of the plasma membrane . The mean radius of 22 nm is within the range of lipid raft size derived by other methods , which esti - mated diameters of (cid:5) 70 nm ( Friedrichson and Kurzchalia , 1998 ; Varma and Mayor , 1998 ; Pralle et al . , 2000 ) . Detec - tion of clustering is extremely sensitive to fixation and label - ing procedures . Glutaraldehyde fixation must be used to eliminate short - range antibody - induced aggregation into larger clusters ( Fig . S3 a ) , and clustering is only evident when gold particles (cid:6) 6 nm in diameter are directly conju - gated to primary antibody ( Fig . S3 b ) . We tested if GFP - tH microdomains are cholesterol - dependent by treating cells with methyl - (cid:7) - cyclodextrin . De - pletion of cell surface cholesterol , visualized by filipin stain - ing ( Fig . 1 b ) , did not cause any loss of GFP - tH from the plasma membrane , assessed qualitatively by fluorescence or quantitatively by immunogold labeling ( not depicted ) . However , K - function analysis of the gold patterns reveals a time - dependent loss of GFP - tH clustering in cyclodextrin - treated cells ( Fig . 1 c ) . After 60 min of cyclodextrin treat - ment , L ( r ) (cid:2) r tracks at zero over most of the r range analyzed , indicating a random distribution . These results confirm that GFP - tH is localized to cholesterol - rich lipid rafts and reveals that their disruption disperses GFP - tH over the plasma membrane , rather than driving association with other microdomains . The presence of rafts in the extracellu - lar leaflet of the plasma membrane was supported by stud - ies showing cholesterol - dependent clustering of glycophos - phatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins ( Friedrichson and Kurzchalia , 1998 ; Harder et al . , 1998 ; Varma and Mayor , 1998 ) , but similar data for rafts in the intracellular leaflet have been lacking until now . Next , we examined the relationship between inner - and outer - leaflet lipid rafts using a variation of the K - function analysis . When plasma membrane sheets are labeled for two different antigens with 2 nm and 4 – 5 nm gold , colocaliza - tion can be assessed using bivariate K - functions that deter - mine whether one gold population is clustered with respect to the other ( Diggle , 1986 ; see Materials and methods and supplementary data ) . We compared the distribution of GFP - tH with the outer - leaflet raft marker GFP - GPI ; Fig . 2 ) . Both proteins are GFP - tagged , but because only one membrane surface is exposed at any point in the labeling and rip - off procedure , no leakage of gold probes occurs ( un - published data ) . We used two protocols to induce different * Abbreviations used in this paper : CSR , complete spatial randomness ; GPI , glycophosphatidylinositol . Figure 1 .

Untreated GFP - tH ( t (cid:3) 0 , red line ) shows maximal deflection from CSR at r (cid:3) 22 nm . Cyclodextrin - treated cells show a time - dependent loss of GFP - tH clustering such that at t (cid:3) 60 min , GFP - tH is not clustered .

The semi - patched technique induces relatively little GFP - GPI aggregation ( univariate K - function shows a mean cluster ra - dius of 50 nm ) , whereas the patched protocol , routinely used to visualize lipid rafts by immunofluorescence , induces very large GFP - GPI aggregates ( univariate K - function shows a mean radius of 180 nm ) . It is not possible to completely evaluate unpatched GFP - GPI because this necessitates rip - ping off apical membranes from prefixed cells , a technique that has to date proven unsuccessful . The bivariate K - func - tion shows that there is significant colocalization of GFP - tH with GFP - GPI only when GFP - GPI is aggregated into very large patches ( Fig . 2 d ) ; this is indicated by significant posi - tive deflections of the L biv ( r ) (cid:2) r curve from zero . Interest - ingly , despite the major reorganization of GFP - GPI , GFP - tH remains in small clusters ( Fig . 2 b ; univariate K - function for GFP - tH ) . This result indicates that inner leaflet rafts , when aggregated by cross - linking GPI - anchored proteins , still retain their modular structure . Incomplete colocaliza - tion of inner - and outer - leaflet raft markers has been ob - served previously ( Harder et al . , 1998 ; Prior et al . , 2001 ) , but our new data show that inner and outer leaflet rafts are only loosely associated at steady state . This offers a potential new mechanism for regulating signaling by modulating the extent of coupling between inner and outer leaflet rafts . Full - length GFP – H - ras and GFP – H - rasG12V also have clustered distributions when expressed in BHK cells ( Fig . 3 ) . However , in contrast to GFP - tH , cyclodextrin treatment has Figure 2 .

Univariate K - function analysis of GFP - tH ( b ) and GFP - GPI ( c ) show that extensive GFP - GPI aggregation is induced by the patched protocol ( closed diamonds ) , but that GFP - tH remains clustered in small microdomains . Bivariate K - function analysis shows that GFP - tH and GFP - GPI co - cluster when GFP - GPI is aggregated into large patches ( d , closed diamonds ) .

Clustering of GDP - bound H - ras ( a ; GFP - HG12 ) and activated H - ras ( b ; GFP - HG12V ) changes little with cyclodextrin treatment .

These data are consistent with a model where full - length H - ras has affinity for , and is resident in at least two plasma membrane microdomains ; lipid rafts , and a noncholesterol - dependent nonraft micro - domain ( Jaumot et al . , 2001 ; Prior et al . , 2001 ) . To formally test this hypothesis , we used bivariate K - function analysis to study the interaction of H - ras with lipid rafts . GFP - tH was coexpressed with untagged H - ras and plasma membrane sheets labeled with anti - GFP – 2 nm and anti - Ras – 4 nm gold . Bivariate analysis of the gold patterns ( Fig . 3 d ) reveals extensive colocalization of GDP - bound H - ras with GFP - tH in serum - starved cells , and shows that this decreases with se - rum stimulation . Constitutively activated H - rasG12V gives an even clearer picture of this phenomenon in that L biv ( r ) (cid:2) r trends around zero , indicating no detectable colocalization of GFP - tH with H - rasG12V ( Fig . 3 d ) . Together with the recent FRAP analysis of GFP - H - Ras in living cells , our re - sults strongly suggest that wild - type H - ras is normally in a dynamic equilibrium between lipid rafts and other noncho - lesterol - dependent microdomains . Interaction with the non - raft site is favored experimentally by disrupting lipid rafts , i . e . , removing one of the H - ras interaction sites , or physio - logically by GTP loading . Thus , constitutively active H - ras is predominantly resident in the nonraft microdomain . The interaction of H - ras with the nonraft domain requires pro - tein sequences in the hypervariable region because GFP - tH clustering is abolished by cyclodextrin treatment , whereas GFP - CTH is not . Recent studies have shown that galectin - 1 interacts with the processed COOH terminus of activated H - ras and may stabilize plasma membrane binding ( Paz et al . , 2001 ) . Therefore , we examined whether galectin - 1 might also be involved in regulating the microlocalization of activated H - ras . Transfection with antisense galectin - 1 reduces endog - enous galectin - 1 expression ( Fig . 3 e ; Paz et al . , 2001 ) and significantly reduces the clustering of H - rasG12V ( Fig . 3 f ) . These data suggest that galectin - 1 may have a critical role in stabilizing H - ras interactions with nonraft microdomains that in turn may also be required for stable plasma mem - brane association of activated H - ras . Little is known about the microlocalization of K - ras tar - geted by a polylysine domain and a farnesylated CAAX mo - tif . Therefore , we investigated the distribution of GFP fused to the minimal plasma membrane targeting motifs of K - ras , GFP - tK . Analysis of the GFP - tK – labeled gold patterns re - veals that they are clustered , but with different characteris - tics from GFP - tH ( Fig . 4 a and Fig . S1 a ) . Modeling estab - lishes that the GFP - tK domains have a mean radius of 16 (cid:4) 3 nm and occupy 20 % of the plasma membrane ( Fig . S1 c ) . In contrast to GFP - tH , cholesterol depletion causes a small rise in GFP - tK clustering after 60 min of cyclodextrin treat - ment . The subtle effect of cyclodextrin on GFP - tK micro - domains may reflect a general role of cholesterol in main - taining overall plasma membrane integrity . Wild - type and constitutively active K - ras show identical clustering to GFP - tK , both in the presence or absence of cyclodextrin ( unpub - lished data ) , and bivariate analysis of plasma membranes co - expressing GFP - tH and activated K - rasG12V showed no significant colocalization of the lipid raft marker with K - ras ( Fig . 4 b ) . Clustering of GFP - tK and K - ras was unexpected , although biophysical studies have shown that myristoylated polybasic peptides can sequester negatively charged lipids to generate novel membrane domains ( Murray et al . , 1999 ) . Intriguingly , clustering was strikingly reduced when the wild - type K - ras CVIM motif was replaced with CCIL , to di - rect geranylgeranylation rather than farnesylation ( Fig . 4 c , GFP - tKCCIL ) . Therefore , our data show that nature of the Figure 4 . K - ras clusters in nonraft microdomains distinct from H - ras microdomains . Peak clustering of GFP - tK occurs at 16 nm ; clustering is increased slightly with cyclodextrin treatment ( a ; t (cid:3) 0 min , open squares ; t (cid:3) 15 min , open triangles ; t (cid:3) 60 min , open circles ) . Bivariate K - function analysis indicates no significant colocalization of activated K - ras with the lipid raft marker GFP - tH ( b ) . ( c ) Replacement of the farnesyl group of GFP - tK ( open squares ) with a geranylgeranyl group results in a significant reduction in clustering ( GFP - tKCCIL , open diamonds ) . Bivariate analysis of the association of activated Ras with microdomains marked by GFP - tK ( d ) shows significant colocalization of K - rasG12V with GFP - tK ( open squares ) , but no significant colocalization of H - rasG12V with GFP - tK ( open diamonds ) . Representative examples of electron microscopic images of GFP - tK ( e ) and GFP - tKCCIL ( f ) are shown . K - functions are means ( n (cid:8) 9 for each condition ) standardized on the 99 % CI for univariates and 95 % CI for bivariates ( closed circles ) .

Overall , our results clearly demonstrate for the first time the existence of K - ras microdomains within disordered plasma membranes that are distinct from classical lipid rafts . Our analysis shows that neither activated H - ras nor K - ras localize to lipid rafts ( Fig . 3 d and Fig . 4 b ) . A direct test of colocalization in cells coexpressing activated H - and K - ras is not possible at present because of a lack of suitable antibod - ies , and the fact that short NH 2 - terminal epitopes on Ras proteins attached to plasma membrane sheets are not visible to gold - conjugated antibodies ( unpublished data ) . To indi - rectly address whether activated H - ras and K - ras occupy the same nonraft signaling domain , we used bivariate K - func - tions to examine colocalization to microdomains defined by the presence of GFP - tK . In this analysis , the L biv ( r ) (cid:2) r curve for K - rasG12V coexpressed with GFP - tK shows significant deviation from zero , whereas the curve for H - rasG12V coexpressed with GFP - tK does not leave the 95 % confidence interval ( Fig . 4 d ) . This result indicates that a sig - nificant fraction of activated K - ras , but not H - ras , resides in microdomains labeled by GFP - tK . We can conclude from these data that the majority of activated H - ras does not colo - calize with activated K - ras , indicating distinct ( if not exclu - sive ) locations for Ras microlocalization . The localization of activated H - and K - ras to different microdomains is impor - tant because if the distribution of effectors and / or concen - tration of cofactors for effector activation also varies across these distinct microenvironments , then differential signal output from H - and K - ras can be readily accounted for . For example , K - ras is a more potent activator of Raf than H - ras ( Yan et al . , 1998 ) . Therefore , we might expect cofactors in Raf activation ( such as phosphatidyl serine ) to be more en - riched in K - ras compared with H - ras microdomains . The challenge now is to better define the protein and lipid con - tent of these microdomains . A recent study has shown GFP dimerization compromises FRET analysis of protein – protein interactions in intact cells and results in lipid raft – targeted CFP and YFP continuing to display FRET when cells are treated with cyclodextrin ( Zacharias et al . , 2002 ) . In contrast , we show here that GFP - tH clustering detected by immunogold labeling is com - pletely abolished with cyclodextrin treatment ; thus , if GFP is dimerized , then the gold - labeled antibody must detect only one GFP epitope in the dimer . Therefore , this loss of clustering is an important validation of the methodology , and clearly demonstrates that potential antibody or GFP dimerization – induced artifacts are not being observed . A similar argument applies to the loss of GFP - tK and GFP – H - rasG12V clustering induced by changing the prenoid group or reducing galectin expression , respectively , and an analysis of non - GFP tagged Ras clustering with anti - Ras – 5 nm gold that yields very similar results to those observed with GFP - tagged Ras ( unpublished data ) . Finally , we can also detect marked differences in the clustering of different transmem - brane - anchored plasma membrane proteins , e . g . , GFP - tagged EGF receptor is not clustered when expressed at relatively low levels ( Fig . S3 c ) , whereas GFP - tagged An - giotensin II , Type 1 receptor , a G protein – coupled receptor , is highly clustered when expressed at comparable levels ( un - published data ) . In summary , we have integrated powerful statistical analy - sis tools with high resolution imaging of morphologically featureless plasma membrane microdomains . This has al - lowed us to characterize both the size and distribution of lipid rafts and Ras signaling domains at steady state . Ras proteins are clustered irrespective of activation state , and oc - cupy multiple raft and nonraft microdomains that are exten - sively distributed over the cell surface . K - ras requires the farnesyl moiety for correct microlocalization , whereas galec - tin - 1 stabilizes H - ras interactions with nonraft microdomains . Our analysis shows that activated H - ras and activated K - ras largely occupy spatially distinct plasma membrane signaling domains ; an observation that could account for differential signal outputs from these highly homologous proteins . Fi - nally , the technique we have described has the potential to spatially map any epitope - tagged or endogenous signaling protein with respect to validated microdomain signposts . This will greatly facilitate studies dissecting the spatial orga - nization and regulation of plasma membrane – based signal - ing pathways . Materials and methods Reagents Affinity - purified polyclonal anti - GFP and monoclonal anti - Ras Y13 – 238 antibodies , and GFP - tH , GFP - tK , and GFP - ras plasmids have been de - scribed previously ( Prior et al . , 2001 ) . GFP - GPI was a gift from Chiara Zur - zolo ( Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II , Naples , Italy ) and GFP - EGF receptor was a gift from Mark Philips ( New York University , NY ) . Galectin - 1 antisense expression plasmids and pAb was a gift from Yoel Kloog ( Tel - Aviv University , Tel - Aviv , Israel ) . Gold - conjugated antibodies were prepared by the tannic acid / citrate method ( Slot and Geuze , 1985 ) . 2 - nm and 4 – 5 - nm gold antibody conjugates were further purified on a 10 – 40 % glycerol gradient . Electron microscopy and image analysis LipofectAMINE™ - transfected cells were incubated overnight in serum - free medium and , if indicated , treated with 1 % methyl - (cid:7) - cyclodextrin . Plasma membrane sheets were prepared , fixed with 4 % PFA , 0 . 1 % glutaralde - hyde , labeled as described previously ( Parton and Hancock , 2001 ) , and photographed in an electron microscope ( model 1010 ; JEOL USA , Inc . ) . 1 . 45 - (cid:9) m 2 areas ( for univariate analysis ) or 0 . 725 - (cid:9) m 2 areas ( for bivariate analysis ) of digitized negatives were processed using Adobe Photoshop ® 5 . 0 Curves , Brightness / Contrast , and Airbrush tools to remove background . To ensure that all gold particles were counted , a 1 - pixel line was inserted between conjoined particles . The coordinates of the gold particles were determined using NIH Image v1 . 82 . For double - labeled areas , small gold was discerned from large gold by setting the limits for counting in NIH Im - age to values determined by precalibrating the gold fractions ( see supple - mentary data ) . Gold densities were comparable within experiments , typi - cally 500 – 800 gold / (cid:9) m 2 for single - labeled and 100 – 200 gold / (cid:9) m 2 for each gold probe in double - labeled areas . GFP - GPI clustering Cells were cotransfected with GFP - GPI and GFP - tH constructs . For semi - patching , cells on coverslips were incubated with anti - GFP – 2 nm gold for 45 min at 10 – 12 (cid:10) C . To induce extensive aggregation ( patched protocol ) , washed cells were then further incubated with anti – rabbit - CY3 for 45 min at 10 – 12 (cid:10) C . After further washing , plasma membrane sheets were prepared and labeled with anti - GFP – 5 nm . Statistics The first order property of a point pattern is its intensity (cid:11) ( (cid:3) N / A ) , where N (cid:3) number of points in the study area A . The second order property is characterized by Ripley’s K - function K ( r ) , where the expected number of neighbors N ( r ) within a distance r of any point in A is given by N ( r ) (cid:3) (cid:11) K ( r ) . Thus , K ( r ) (cid:3) N ( r ) / (cid:11) , and it normalizes N ( r ) for the density of the pattern . on J une 21 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published January 13 , 2003 Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy 170 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 160 , Number 2 , 2003 Our question is whether gold particles are clustered or exhibit CSR . In ran - dom patterns , at any distance r , the expected value of N ( r ) is (cid:11)(cid:12) r 2 , so K ( r ) (cid:3) (cid:12) r 2 . If K ( r ) (cid:13) (cid:12) r 2 , the gold particles have more neighbors than ex - pected from CSR , i . e . , are clustered . We use a linear transformation of K ( r ) where L ( r ) (cid:3) √ K ( r ) / (cid:12) ( Besag , 1977 ) . L ( r ) (cid:2) r is readily interpreted because under CSR , the expected value of L ( r ) (cid:2) r (cid:3) 0 for all values of r . We esti - mate N ( r ) as the mean value calculated over A , taking into account border effects ( Ripley , 1977 ) , and calculate L ( r ) (cid:2) r from the above equations . When there are big gold ( N b ) and small gold ( N s ) in A , their distributions are described by three K - functions . The univariate functions K b ( r ) and K s ( r ) are used as above . The bivariate function K biv ( r ) maps distances from each big to each small gold particle , and vice versa . K biv ( r ) examines whether ei - ther gold particle population , at a distance r , is clustered around the other ; a test of colocalization ( Diggle , 1986 ) . Significance tests of L ( r ) (cid:2) r and L biv ( r ) (cid:2) r are performed by Monte Carlo methods ( Besag and Diggle , 1977 ; for review see supplementary data ) .
