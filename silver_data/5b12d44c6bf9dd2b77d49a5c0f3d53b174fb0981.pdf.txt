We effectively eliminated photobleach - ing from our measurements by reducing exposure time to the lowest possible values ( Supplementary Note ) . FP maturation is often modeled as a first - order process with single exponential kinetics and a characteristic half - time ( t 50 ) . However , we observed highly diverse maturation kinetics ( see Supplementary Note for all maturation curves ) , even for FPs that form the same chromophore . Some variants , such as mEGFP , exhibited simple first - order kinetics—the fraction of imma - ture protein as a function of time followed a single exponential ( Fig . 1a ) . The maturation of other variants , such as mGFPmut2 , however , was better described by two exponentials indicating the existence of effectively two kinetic steps in the maturation proc - ess ( Fig . 1b ) . In a third example , the maturation rate of wild - type GFP ( wtGFP ) was initially slow but progressively became faster ( Fig . 1c ) . These ‘complex maturation’ kinetics were not caused by multimerization , since introducing the monomeric substitu - tion A206K to wtGFP ( mwtGFP ) resulted in the same matura - tion curve ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Similar complex maturation has previously been observed in red FPs 9 – 11 ; however , several FPs derived from Aequorea victoria FPs ( avFPs ) —for example , moxGFP , SCFP1 , mTurquoise2 and mClover3—also showed com - plex maturation kinetics , which indicated that such kinetics are not an exclusive property of red FPs . In view of this diversity of maturation kinetics , we chose to report two effective maturation times , t 50 and t 90 , that correspond to the time it takes for 50 % or 90 % of fluorescent proteins , respectively , to become mature ( Table 1 and Supplementary Data 1 ) . Although the precise mechanism behind different maturation kinetics is unclear , we speculate that amino acids flanking the chromophore forming residues may play a key role ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . The coding sequence ( CDS ) of FPs is often optimized with synonymous codons to increase FP expression in different organisms . Another common modification to improve expres - sion is the addition of valine at the second amino acid position . We found that maturation kinetics were not affected by either change ( Supplementary Figs . 8 and 9 ) . By contrast , we discovered that many FPs reported in the literature under the same name had different nonsynonymous CDSs . The most surprising case was that of ‘Venus’ , for which we found four slightly different Systematic characterization of maturation time of fluorescent proteins in living cells Enrique Balleza , J Mark Kim & Philippe Cluzel FAS Center for Systems Biology , Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology , School of Engineering and Applied Sciences , Harvard University , Cambridge , Massachusetts , USA .

We used high - precision time - lapse microscopy to characterize the maturation kinetics of 50 FPs that span the visible spectrum at two different temperatures in Escherichia coli cells . We identified fast - maturing FPs from this set that yielded the highest signal - to - noise ratio and temporal resolution in individual growing cells . FPs are commonly used to monitor dynamic cellular processes in a wide variety of biological systems . Nascent FPs , however , must undergo a stochastic maturation step to become fluorescent ; the kinetics of this maturation process directly affect the accuracy with which biological processes can be monitored . While many studies have exhaustively compiled in vitro characteristics of FPs 1 – 4 , the maturation times of FPs in living cells remain sparsely characterized 5 , 6 , and no single ‘gold - standard’ method has been established for carrying out such measurements . The lack of sys - tematic maturation measurements might be due to the inherent complexity of the maturation process , which involves , in addition to the folding of the β - barrel , torsional rearrangements , cycliza - tion , oxidation and dehydration of the chromophore 7 . However , even if the full details of these processes are not completely under - stood , a systematic empirical characterization of maturation times of FPs in living cells would be highly valuable , as it would help researchers select the fastest maturing proteins or be aware of artifacts inherent to slow FPs . To measure maturation kinetics with high precision , we used an agarose - based , single - cell chemostat that allowed us to image and track hundreds of bacterial colonies growing exponentially in a tightly regulated environment for more than 30 generations 8 ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . This setup also allowed us to precisely control the delivery of chloramphenicol , a translation inhibitor widely used to assess maturation times 6 , 9 , via microfluidic flow . When cells producing FPs are exposed to this drug , translation is rapidly arrested , but FP maturation continues . As previously synthesized proteins mature and become visible , the fluorescence signal continues to increase despite the absence of newly syn - thesized FPs ( Supplementary Figs . 2 – 4 ) . From the fluorescence increase , we quantified the fraction of immature protein at the © 20 17 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . , p a r t o f S p r i ng e r N a t u r e .

In such cases , we classified each nonsynonymous variant as a distinct FP . There are several FPs that share the same β - barrel structure but have a different chromophore or different residues surrounding the chromophore . These FPs had different maturation times : the pattern was observed for the green FPs mEGFP , mGFPmut2 and mwtGFP ; the blue FPs SCFP1 , SCFP3A and mTurquoise2 ; and the yellow FPs mVenNB , VenJBC and mVenElo . For contrast , we decided to study the effect of specific mutations that would not per - turb the chromophore environment . We selected four amino acid substitutions classified as ‘spectroscopically silent’ because they do not affect the spectroscopic properties of the chromophore : F99S 16 , K206A ( the revertant of the monomeric substitution A206K ) 17 , ∆ C9 ( truncation of the last nine C - terminal amino acids ) 18 , and ∆ C9 combined with M153T 16 . These mutations were introduced into mGFPmut2 . In all cases , the spectroscopically silent mutants retained maturation kinetics similar to those of mGFPmut2 ( Supplementary Fig . 10a – d ) . Moreover , t 50 and t 90 were practi - cally identical ( Supplementary Fig . 10e , f ) , and the substitutions did not change the original mGFPmut2 spectra ( Supplementary Fig . 10g ) . These experiments suggest that spectroscopically silent mutations do not necessarily affect maturation kinetics . Moreover , since mutations F99S and M153T have been associated with improved folding 16 , these results suggest that chromophore maturation and folding are not intrinsically coupled processes . Our experiments also revealed that the in vitro brightness of FPs ( F in vitro = molar extinction ( ε ) × quantum yield ( QY ) ) alone was a poor predictor of fluorescence signal in growing cells even when adjusted for differences in net expression levels ( F expression ) ( Fig . 1d and Supplementary Data 2 and 3 ) . In turn , we hypoth - esized that by taking the maturation time into account as well , we could better predict fluorescence signal in growing cells . Indeed , we found that simply multiplying the term F in vitro × F expression with an additional factor that quantifies the interplay between maturation time ( t 50 ) and dilution of proteins due to cell growth ( t gr ) , F mat = 1 / ( 1 + t 50 / t gr ) 19 , was sufficient to robustly predict fluorescence signal in growing cells ( Fig . 1e ) . A similar agreement was found between fluorescence signal in batch cultures quanti - fied by flow cytometry and the product F in vitro × F expression × F mat ( Supplementary Fig . 11 and Supplementary Data 4 ) . Note that in growing cell cultures , when FP expression is at steady state , fluorescence signal from fast FPs can be greater than that from slower FPs with similar or even greater in vitro brightness . We also found that variations in quantitation of in vitro brightness did not play a role as important as that of maturation time for selecting FPs with the greatest fluorescence signal in fast - growing cells ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . We also investigated the effect of maturation time when FPs were used to report transcription in single cells . Under these conditions , FP expression can be highly dynamic and may not reach a steady state . For example , transcription from the lacZ promoter , P lacZ , under repressed conditions ( lacI + strain , glucose + no inducer ) occurs in bursts 20 . To examine how maturation time would affect the measurement of such processes , we moni - tored the activity of the repressed P lacZ driving the expression of either mGFPmut2 ( fast ) or mEGFP ( slow ) . To ensure equal F expression , both FPs had nucleotide sequences that were identical except for three residues unique to each FP . We also confirmed equal F expression by quantifying protein expression by SDS – PAGE gel densitometry ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . While both pro - teins had approximately the same in vitro brightness ( ε × QY = 45 . 5 for mEGFP versus ε × QY = 39 . 3 for mGFPmut2 ) , the signal from cells with mGFPmut2 was systematically stronger ( Fig . 2a , b and Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . Moreover , we observed richer promoter dynamics with the fast - maturing FP ( Fig . 2a ) . We reasoned that , since fast FPs concentrate fluorescence signal within a shorter time window , they are better suited not only for temporal precision , but also for detecting small transient events ( Fig . 2c ) . In line with this hypothesis , transcriptional bursts reported with the fast FP were consistently greater in amplitude than those reported with the slow FP ( Fig . 2d ) . Moreover , the slow FP smeared the promoter dynamics so much that it almost resembled that of a constitutive promoter , a result which was in stark contrast to the previously reported burst activity of the repressed P lacZ 20 .

Also , the fast FP could report faster promoter dynamics than the slow FP could ( Fig . 2e ) . Based on the superior performance of the fast green FP , we predicted that the fastest cyan FP SCFP3A would be a bet - ter reporter than the brighter in vitro —but slower—mTurquoise2 ( ε × QY = 28 . 7 for mTurquoise2 versus ε × QY = 17 . 1 for SCFP3A ) to quantify the dynamics of the repressed P lacZ . Indeed , the dim - mer SCFP3A exhibited a 40 % larger dynamic range and had three times better temporal resolution than the brighter in vitro mTurquoise2 ( Supplementary Fig . 16 ) despite having similar expression levels ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . Our work demonstrates that in growing cells , there exists a fraction of immature FPs , and that accounting for this fraction via the maturation time is crucial for explaining the relationship between in vitro brightness and fluorescence signal in growing cells ( Fig . 1e ) . We hypothesize that , even in different environ - ments , fast FPs will remain faster than slow FPs and thus remain preferable . For example , at different temperatures ( 37 °C and 32 °C ) , the ranking of maturation times is preserved ; fast - maturing FPs still mature faster despite changes in the absolute maturation time . We note that independent of F in vitro and F mat , fluorescence in growing cells may also unexpectedly vary because of organism - specific effects on net protein expression ( F expression ) ( extended discussion in Supplementary Note ) . However , as a general guide , we recommend the use of fast - maturing FPs , which will likely yield higher fluorescence signals—particularly in fast - growing cells—and , independent of growth rate , increase the temporal resolution of any time - lapse measurements . Specifically , our results show that SCFP3A , mGFPmut2 and mVenNB are likely the best fluorescent proteins to use for monitoring rapid cellular processes and that they will also give the brightest overall signal for monitoring rapid processes among the cyan , green and yellow classes , respectively . For the orange - red to far - red catego - ries , we suggest avoiding slow - maturing red FPs and to be aware of their oligomeric tendency and the incomplete maturation of their chromophore , which sometimes gives rise to unintended emission in the blue - yellow part of the spectrum . In light of these limitations , we recommend mScarlet - I and mCherry2 . mEthOdS Methods , including statements of data availability and any associ - ated accession codes and references , are available in the online version of the paper .

A ll r i gh t s r e se r ve d . doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 4509 natURE mEthOdS OnlInE mEthOdS Molecular cloning . All experiments and cloning were performed with Escherichia coli MG1655 ( The Coli Genetic Stock Center , Yale University ; CGSC 6300 ) . All avGFP derivatives were con - structed from an initial mGFPmut2 template used to generate linear fragments of dsDNA with the appropriate point mutations at the 5 ′ and 3 ′ ends . Linear fragments ( from one to six fragments , depending on the FP ) and the backbone were assembled together in a single isothermal assembly reaction 21 . The backbone confers kanamycin resistance and harbors the low - copy origin SC101 . FP expression was controlled by a member of a set of constitu - tive promoters , proC 22 , the T7 RBS and the T1 terminator . The mNeonGreen gene was a gift from J . Paulsson ( Department of Systems Biology , HMS , Harvard University ) . All red FP genes were ordered as gBlocks from Integrated DNA Technologies ( IDT ) and cloned into a similar backbone as the one used for avGFPs . All FP coding sequences were confirmed by Sanger DNA sequencing from two clones . See Supplementary Note for the coding sequence definition of all FPs . P lacZ reporters with FPs of interest were cloned into the chro - mosome using the λ - Red homologous recombination system 23 . FPs were controlled by an RBS designed by Ishida and Oshima 24 . The RBS is a strong RBS and leaves the lacI binding site O1 and its context intact ( Supplementary Fig . 17 ) . There is a kanamy - cin cassette as selection marker located downstream of the FP gene . The sequences used as homologies for the integration were 5 ′ AATTGTGAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGAAACAGCTATGACCA and 5 ′ TTAAATAGTACATAATGGATTTCCTTACG CGAAATACGGGCAGACATGGC . Estimation of FP expression using SDS – PAGE gel densitometry . Exponentially growing cells were harvested at OD 600 = 0 . 6 , concentrated 15× , aliquoted and immediately stored at −80 °C for later processing . Later , 8 µ l of thawed cells were mixed with 7 µ l of 4× SDS – PAGE loading buffer and incubated at 98 °C for 12 min . Samples were loaded into a 4 – 20 % SDS - PAGE gel . The gel was run at 200 V for 65 min . After electrophoresis , the gel was stained with Brilliant Blue and destained until the gel was transparent . The gel was imaged while taking special care not to overexpose the image . Densitometry analysis was performed with the software GelAnalyzer 2010a . Total protein density profile was background corrected using the rolling ball method . Using the protein profile from background strain MG1655 , density contri - bution from endogenous proteins at ~ 27 kDa was estimated and subtracted from the raw FP value . FP densities were normalized using two sets of stereotypical total - protein bands around 40 kDa and 100 kDa . We ran two technical replicates with two differ - ent loading patterns to compensate for systematic gel distortions ( Supplementary Fig . 18 ) . Protein extraction and purification . The three phase partition - ing ( TPP ) procedure 25 , 26 was used to extract and purify avFPs . Cultures were grown from single colonies in 50 ml of LB Lennox with shaking at 30 °C for 2 d . Cells were pelleted down at 10 , 000 × g for 1 min and resuspended in 25 ml of 1 . 6 M ammonium sulfate in Tris – HCl buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 ) . The resuspen - sion was shaken for 30 min , and cells were again pelleted at 10 , 000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 7 . 5 ml of 1 . 6 M ammo - nium sulfate . 1st stage of three phase partitioning . A 2 . 4 ml aliquot from the resuspension was transferred to a 5 ml Eppendorf tube and mixed vigorously for 10 min at 37 °C in a vortex mixer with a special adaptor to fit 5 ml tubes . Subsequently , 2 . 6 ml of t - Butanol was added , and the mixture was again shaken vigorously for 10 min at 37 °C . The 5 ml tube was centrifuged at 21 , 000 × g for 5 min to separate the mixture into three phases . The bottom phase ( ~ 2 ml ) was transferred into a fresh 5 ml Eppendorf tube by pierc - ing through the upper two layers and aspirating . 2nd stage of TPP . 3 ml of t - Butanol was added to the recovered phase , and the mixture was shaken vigorously for 5 min at 37 °C and centrifuged at 21 , 000 × g for 10 min to separate the mixture into three phases , the second phase being an extremely thin disc with all the FP . The thin disc was separated by slowly decanting the bottom and upper phases ; the thin FP disc remained stuck to the wall of the tube . The tube was left standing for 1 min , and the residual t - Butanol / ammonium sulfate at the bottom was aspirated . The FP disc was redissolved in 150 – 250 µ l of 1 . 6 M ammonium sulfate . 3rd stage of TPP . The 5 ml tube with the redissolved FP was cen - trifuged at 21 , 000 × g for 20 min . The crystal - clear aqueous phase was transferred with a pipettor to a sterile 1 . 5 ml Eppendorf tube . Care was taken to avoid pelleted debris and to avoid aspirating possible residual t - Butanol ( a thin upper layer ) . Purified protein was stored at 4 °C . Spectroscopy . Fluorescence spectra were acquired in a Horiba / Yvon FluoroMax - 4 Spectrofluorometer . The instrument corrects for excitation lamp fluctuations and compensates for the spectral dependence of detector efficiency . Spectra were acquired with a 1 nm resolution , and the mean spectrum was derived from four readings using the following parameters : YFP Ex 482 and Em 497 - 685 , GFP Ex 455 Em 470 - 675 and Cyan Ex 425 Em 445 - 750 . The integration range for CFPs was broad enough to capture the complete tail of the coumarin reference dye . Samples were at least a 20× dilution ( in Tris - HCl buffer , pH 8 ) of the purified protein recovered at the end of the 3rd stage of the TPP . Thus , final ammo - nium sulfate concentration was at most 70 mM . Absorbance spectra were acquired using a Shimadzu SolidSpec - 3700 / 3700DUV . To avoid reabsorption effects , samples and standard dyes were diluted until the absorption maximum did not exceed a reading of 0 . 1 units . Three spectrum readings were taken and averaged . We used polymethyl methacrylate ( PMMA ) cuvettes , BrandTech Scientific 759125 . Cuvettes were taken from the same box ( i . e . , same mold cavity for all cuvettes , manufacturer description ) to ensure lowest variation in extinction coefficient . In comparison to the absorption maxima of FPs , the extinc - tion - coefficient variation due to cuvette manufacturing was less than 0 . 5 % . Thus , all the FP spectra were corrected with the same average background absorption for a given box of cuvettes ( Supplementary Fig . 19 ) . Estimate of quantum yield and molar extinction coefficient . SDS – PAGE densitometry was used to estimate the amount of purified FP at the end of the 3rd step of TPP . Briefly , 3 . 25 µ l of purified protein in 1 . 6 M ammonium sulfate was mixed with 5 . 75 µ l of 4× SDS – PAGE sample - loading buffer in PCR tubes . FP samples were denatured by heating at 98 °C for 12 min . In parallel , a dilution series of purified BSA ( concentrations : 1 . 000 , 0 . 666 , © 20 17 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . , p a r t o f S p r i ng e r N a t u r e .

FP samples were spiked with 8 µ l of BSA standard such that every sample would have a different known BSA concen - tration . Volume was adjusted to 20 µ l . Samples were loaded into a 4 – 20 % SDS – PAGE gel . After electrophoresis , the gel was stained with Brilliant Blue and destained until the gel was transparent . The gel was imaged while taking special care not to overexpose the image . Image was analyzed with the Gel Analysis plug - in from ImageJ 27 . A standard curve using the known concentrations and corresponding band densities obtained from the Gel Analysis plug - in was created in Matlab R2013a ( Supplementary Fig . 20 ) . The standard curve was used to estimate the total amount of FP loaded in every well . The molar concentration of the sample was obtained assuming the weight of the FP as 26 . 89 kD . The molar extinction was determined using Beer’s law . We performed a relative determination of fluorescence quan - tum yields ( QYs ) 28 , QY QY st st em st st em f x f x x x F f n F f n , , ( ) ( ) = 2 2 l l where F is the integral photon flux , f the absorption factor at the excitation wavelength ( f = 1 − 10 −Abs ( λ ex ) ) and n the refrac - tive index . st denotes the dye reference and x the FP sample . The refractive indexes of three solvents were needed to calculate QY f , x : ethanol 200 proof , 0 . 1 M NaOH and 50 mM Tris – HCl pH 8 . 0 . Ethanol was the solvent for coumarin . For ethanol , the refrac - tive index used was 1 . 364 ( using the exact refractive index at the average coumarin emission gives negligible differences , http : / / refractiveindex . info ) . For 50 mM Tris – HCl pH 8 , its refractive index was measured with a Milton Roy Abbe 3L refractometer with different amounts of dissolved ammonium sulfate . Results showed that the refractive index of Tris – HCl at relevant ammo - nium sulfate concentrations ( < 70 mM , after doing at least a 20× dilution from our stock of purified FP in ammonium sulfate 1 . 6 M ) was equal to that of water at 25 °C , n = 1 . 335 at 500 nm , http : / / refractiveindex . info . The refractive index of 0 . 1 M sodium hydroxide , the fluorescein solvent , was also found to be equal to that of water . Note that , because the refractive index of water and ethanol are different , the refractive index ratio n n x 2 2 ( ) ( ) l l em st em reduces the relative QY of blue FPs by about 4 % . The refer - ence dyes were fluorescein ‘reference standard’ ( Molecular Probes F - 1300 , Lot # 1691 - 3 ) and coumarin 153 ( 99 % purity , Sigma - Aldrich 546186 - 100MG , lot # MKBV7586V ) . The QYs used were 0 . 89 and 0 . 53 , respectively 28 . For every FP , the protein was extracted / purified , the molar concentration determined and the absorbance / emission spectrum acquired from three independent cultures . QY and molar extinctions were determined from those three independent extractions for all FPs except for moxCerulean , mEmerald , moxGFP , moxVenus . For these FPs , only two inde - pendent extractions were performed . Reported errors are s . d . Estimation of maturation time by translational arrest with chloramphenicol . Single - cell chemostat assembly . Briefly 8 , polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) chambers were cast using homemade metal molds . Then , chambers and glass coverslips were treated with O 2 plasma ( Harrick Plasma ; 18 W , 25 s , 1 , 000 mTor atmos - phere ) and put into contact to induce covalent bonding between the two surfaces . Subsequently , the chamber was pierced at its ends to create an inlet and an outlet with 30G needles . To avoid leakages , needles were sealed to PDMS chambers with a drop of freshly prepared PDMS and left to cure for 2 h at 55 °C . Meanwhile , a patterned agarose slab was prepared by pouring dissolved low - melt agarose ( BP165 , Fisher Scientific ) on top of a PDMS intermediate that had on its surface the negative pattern to be printed on the agarose . Then , the PDMS chamber and a sec - ond square coverslip were plasma treated ( as above ) . Immediately after , 2 µ l of saturated cell culture ( OD 600 ≈ 1 ) was dispensed at the center of the PDMS chamber , the patterned agarose slab was pressed into place , and the chamber was sealed with the square coverslip . The assembled single - cell chemostat was allowed to set for 15 – 30 min before intubating to introduce growth media . Growth media composition . M9 - rich media : M9 salts 1× , casamino acids 0 . 1 % , glucose 0 . 5 % , thiamine 1 µ g / ml , MgSO 4 2 mM , CaCl 2 0 . 1 mM . The day before the experiment , growth media was prepared , its pH was checked ( 7 . 1 ± 0 . 2 ) , and liquid cultures of individual colonies were set for overnight growth . The next morning , cells were diluted 200× in fresh media and incubated for 3 – 4 h before they were loaded into the single - cell chemostat . For the P lacZ experiment , the same M9 - rich media composition was used , except that the amount of casamino acids was reduced 200 - fold to decrease background fluorescence ( final concentration 0 . 005 % ) . The decrease in nutrients increased divi - sion time by ~ 5 min . Temperature calibration . Single - cell chemostat temperature at the objective was carefully characterized for different buffer flow rates ( Supplementary Note ) . 4 h before starting a maturation experiment , the microscopy setup was left to equilibrate to the desired temperature . Buffer exchange . The output of two 30 ml syringes ( one with growth media , the other one with growth media plus chloram - phenicol 100 µ g / ml ) were connected together to a two - input valve with stopcock ( Value Plastics ) . The valve output was connected to the single - cell chemostat . To ensure exponential growth rate before data acquisition , cells were grown inside the chemostat for 4 h at 37 °C with growth media flowing at a rate of 50 µ l / min via a peristaltic pump ( KDS - 210 , KD Scientific ) . Then , data were acquired for 1 h at a rate of one frame per minute . After the first hour , the first pump was stopped , and the second pump , with growth media and chloramphenicol , was activated at a rate of 70 µ l / min . At this rate , growth media in the single - cell chemostat was exchanged in < 20 s with media with chloramphenicol . After buffer exchange and without interruption , data were acquired for another 3 – 4 h . Because of cell wall damage induced by chloram - phenicol treatment , there is an artifactual dependence of pho - tobleaching on chloramphenicol concentration . Nonetheless , there is a chloramphenicol concentration range ( 40 – 200 µ g / ml ) where photobleaching rate is constant ( Supplementary Note and Supplementary Fig . 21 ) . Microscopy . Time lapses were taken with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M and a Plan - Apochromat 40× / 1 . 3 Oil Ph3 . Focal - plane drift was eliminated by using software - based autofocus follow - ing the method described in ref . 29 . In short , we characterized the frequency response of our optical system ( camera / objective ) © 20 17 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . , p a r t o f S p r i ng e r N a t u r e . A ll r i gh t s r e se r ve d . doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 4509 natURE mEthOdS to filter out low - and mid - range frequencies from Z - stacks . Those frequencies are responsible for unwanted contrast reversals usu - ally found in regular software - based autofocuses . A solid - state white illumination SOLA SE II was used for fluorescence exci - tation . The filter set for the green channel was Ex . 482 / 18 , Di . 495 , Em . 520 / 35 ; for the yellow channel it was Ex . 500 / 24 , Di . 520 , Em . 542 / 27 ; for the blue channel it was Ex . 438 / 24 , Di . 458 , Em . 483 / 32 ; and for the red channel it was Ex . 586 / 20 , Di . 605 , Em . 647 / 57 ; all filters were from Semrock . Images were acquired with a CCD camera ( Hamamatsu C4742 - 98 - 24ERG ) . Variation in fluorescence intensity illumination across the field of view was less than 10 % in all channels . Under our experimental conditions , most maturation curves do not exhibit measurable photobleach - ing ; see Supplementary Note and Supplementary Figures 22 and 23 . The microscope setup was controlled with homemade software using Micro - Manager 1 . 4 ( ref . 30 ) and Matlab R2013a . Calculation of the immature fluorescent protein fraction from single - cell data . Selection of single cells . Kymographs of individual linear colonies were constructed from time - lapse movies that con - tained a phase contrast and a fluorescence channel . Using the phase - contrast kymographs , we backtracked—starting from the last frame—only cells that remained in the tracks of the agar pad and that did not lyse . Single - cell fluorescence quantification . For every single cell , using the fluorescence channel kymograph , raw fluorescence was quantified at frame t by adding signal from all pixels within a rectangular window that was twice the width of the cell in order to capture all out - of - focus light ( Supplementary Fig . 24 ) . To measure the background fluorescence as a function of time , a kymograph of an agar pad strip without cells was constructed . To obtain a background - corrected fluorescence value at frame t , the background quantified from the empty agar pad strip at frame t was subtracted from the raw fluorescence value at frame t . Averaging of data . Independently of colony membership , to obtain a mean fluorescence curve , fluorescence data from all cells were added and divided by the number of cells . Similarly , but with single - cell - length data , a mean - length curve was obtained . The mean - length curve was used to determine the precise moment at which chloramphenicol arrived . Fraction of immature fluorescent protein . To obtain the fraction of immature protein , the mean fluorescence was subtracted from the maximum fluorescence value and divided by the fluorescence increase after drug treatment ; see Supplementary Figure 5 for a step - by - step diagram . All analysis was done using Matlab R2013a . Fluorescence signal estimation by flow cytometry . Three rep - licate cultures for every avFP were grown overnight in M9 - rich media at 37 °C . The next day , a first set of replicates was diluted 1 , 000× in fresh M9 - rich media and incubated at 37 °C . After 20 min , the same procedure was followed for the second set of replicates and , finally , after an additional 20 min the third set was also diluted and incubated . The delay between replicates was set to minimize maturation time artifacts in the in vivo brightness deter - mination using flow cytometry . Typically , a single set of replicates would take ~ 6 min to be quantified . After 2 h and 40 min from the first dilution , a second 500× dilution was performed for every set of replicates following the same time delay . After 2 h , the replicates were growing exponentially ( OD 600 = 0 . 05 – 0 . 1 ) . An aliquot of the first set was transferred to a 96 - well plate prewarmed to 37 °C and stored in a Styrofoam box . Immediately , samples were measured in a BD LSR Fortessa . The same was done for the second and the third bioreplicate sets . The excitation / emission configuration was CFP Ex . 440 ( laser ) , Em . 470 / 20 ; GFP Ex . 488 ( laser ) , Em . 520 / 35 ; and YFP Ex . 488 ( laser ) , Em . 542 / 27 . Statistical methods . Immature FP fraction curves were initially obtained for several FPs ( mEGFP , mGFPmut2 , mGFPmut3 , sfGFP , SCFP3A , mVenME , mCherry ) with at least three inde - pendent replicates . Once the results from these initial FPs were reproducible , new FPs were measured together with a previously characterized FP as a control . If the control displayed an anoma - lous maturation curve , the experiment was not further analyzed . In a successful experiment , after ~ 2 h of chloramphenicol treat - ment , a small fraction of cells would lose their fluorescence , presumably because of cell wall damage ( Supplementary Note ) . We manually eliminated these cells from the analysis . Mean sin - gle - cell fluorescence curves were derived from the mean of 70 ± 20 cells . We obtained the t 50 and t 90 values by smoothing the log - transformed immature FP fraction curves using the function csaps in MATLAB R2013a with a smoothing parameter equal to 0 . 01 . Errors in quantifying maturation times were estimated by assuming the errors in the average fluorescence to be ± 3 % . The typical error in our average fluorescence curves is below 1 % at fluorescence saturation . Thus , the assumed ± 3 % error in aver - age fluorescence gives at least a confidence interval of 66 % ( 1 s . d . ) and typically a confidence interval of 95 % ( 2 s . d . ) . For spe - cific FPs , the maturation time at 32 °C was estimated using the maturation time measured at 37 °C ( Supplementary Fig . 25 ) . QY and ε average and s . d . were derived from three independent protein extractions except for moxCerulean , mEmerald , moxGFP , moxVenus . For these FPs , only two independent extractions were performed . QY and ε values used for the x - axis of Figure 1d are the values reported when the FPs were first published , except for mVenusME and mCeruleanME ; for these two FPs , we used our own in vitro data ( Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 ) . In the x - axis of Figure 1e , the red FP in vitro data were taken from different labo - ratories ( Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig . 26 ) . For all other FPs , QY and ε were quantified in our laboratory ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . We estimated FP expression by SDS densitometry . F expression is the median ± s . d . of four measure - ments from two SDS gels ( Supplementary Figs . 13 and 18 ; Supplementary Data 2 ) . The two gels were technical replicates . Errors of derived experimental quantities ( e . g . , F in vitro error ) were obtained by propagation of errors from values experimentally determined ( e . g . , quantum yields and extinction coefficients ) . In time traces , single - cell - fluorescence production rate was approximated by finite differences and the result smoothed with the function filtfilt using a filter order equal to 3 and a cutoff frequency equal to 0 . 55 ( Matlab R2013a ) . Autocorrelation of fluorescence production rate was calculated along cell lineages , and sampling bias was eliminated by avoiding counting branches more than once 31 . The estimated autocorrelation decay constants were obtained by fitting the theoretical autocorrelation function given in ref . 20 . We repeated a single experiment with FPs of different colors : two greens ( mGFPmut2 and mEGFP ) and two blues ( SCFP3A and mTurquoise2 ) to support the robustness of the observed effect in Figure 2 . © 20 17 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . , p a r t o f S p r i ng e r N a t u r e .

Sample size Describe how sample size was determined . Fig 1a - c . Sample size was not pre - determined . See Table 1 below . Fig 1d . Y - axis . Sample size was not pre - determined . The mean was derived from 75 + / - 20 cells . The error is the SEM and is on average 20 % . X - axis . Net protein expression was derived from two replicates for each FP . This is enough to distinguish 20 % changes in net protein expression . Compared to the range of relative fluorescence signal covered by our FP library ( see range of X - and Y - axis in Fig 1d ) , data errors in the X - and Y - axis are almost 10 times lower and , as quantified by the r - squared , allows us to clearly distinguish the effect of maturation time between Fig . 1d and Fig . 1e . Fig 1e . Y - axis . Same as Fig 1d . Y - axis . X - axis . Sample size was not predetermined . Quantum yield and molar extinction were derived from 3 protein extractions . This is enough to distinguish 15 % changes in in vitro brightness . Net protein expression was derived from two replicates for each fluorescent protein . This is enough to distinguish 20 % changes in net protein expression . The t50 maturation time error is below 10 % . Propagating the previous errors results in about a 20 % error in the estimated relative fluorescence . This error is almost 10 times lower than the range of relative fluorescence signal covered by our FP library in Fig 1d - e and , as quantified by the r - squared , allows us to clearly distinguish the effect of maturation time between Fig . 1d and Fig . 1e . Fig . 2b , Fig . 2e , S Fig . 15 and S Fig . 16 . Sample size was not pre - determined . mGFPmut2 , ncell = 2489 , mEGFP , ncell = 2581 , mTurquoise2 ncells = 1460 and SCFP3A ncells = 1711 . Fig . 2b . Sample size is large enough that fluctuations in the tail of the distribution are only seen after the 99th percentile . Fig . 2e and S Fig . 16b . The sampling of the autocorrelation functions diminishes as the lag time increases . However , the sampling was high enough at lag time 80min in Fig . 2e ( n = 12000 ) and at lag time 150min ( n = 7500 ) in Fig . 16b to ignore fluctuations . S Fig . 15 and S Fig . 16c . Sample size was enough to have a robust estimation of the dynamic range , i . e . the dynamic range ratio ( fast FP ) / ( slow FP ) is similar using the 1st and the 99th percentile , or using the 2nd and the 98th percentile . Table 1 . Sample size was not pre - determined . Maturation curves were calculated from 75 + / - 20 cells . At 25 % and at 100 % fluorescence , the experimental fluctuation of maturation curves ( local CV value ) is , for the great majority , well below 3 % and 1 % , respectively . Because the trend of the maturation curve ( obtained by a smoothing filter ) is robust to experimental fluctuations , we derived reliable t50 and t90 values from all curves and reported 95 % confidence intervals . To see fine details of the maturation kinetics at , e . g . 90 % fluorescence , error needs to be lower than 1 : 10 . As mentioned above , our error around 100 % fluorescence saturation is below 1 : 100 . Thus , for almost all curves , fluctuations around the mean trend are very low and allow to see the fine details of the maturation kinetics . Exceptions are , at 100 % fluorescence , DsRedEx 32°C ( 4 . 9 % ) , TagRFP 32°C ( 3 . 1 % ) , TagRFP - T 32°C ( 4 . 7 % ) .

Fig . 1 and Table 1 . A few cells would anomalously lose fluorescence after ~ 2hrs of chloramphenicol treatment due , presumably , to cell - wall damage . We plotted the single - cell fluorescence vs time of all tracked cells to visually detect and eliminate those cells from the analysis . Cells were eliminated because including them would have created artificial photobleaching and thus would have altered maturation kinetics measurements . Fig . 2 and S Fig . 16 . An experiment in the single - cell chemostat is recorded using many fields of view ( FOV ) . Some FOVs are not analyzable because ( i ) local fluorescence background is too high due to bad buffer flow , ( ii ) or cells do not grow along the linear tracks and create biofilms instead of linear colonies or ( iii ) the microscope software would fail to track the FOV . We only included in the analysis , linear colonies from FOV without these problems . 3 . Replication Describe whether the experimental findings were reliably reproduced . Fig . 1 and Table 1 . Immature FP fraction curves were initially obtained for several FPs ( mEGFP , mGFPmut2 , mGFPmut3 , sfGFP , SCFP3A , mVenME ) with at least 3 independent replicates . Once the results from these initial FPs were reproducible , new FPs were measured together with a previously characterized FP as a control . If the control displayed an anomalous maturation curve , the experiment was not further analyzed . Fig . 2 and S Fig . 16 . We performed a single experiment with FPs of different colors : two greens ( mGFPmut2 & mEGFP ) and two blues ( SCFP3A & mTurquoise2 ) to support the robustness of the observed effect . 4 . Randomization Describe how samples / organisms / participants were allocated into experimental groups . It does not apply to our work because we do not have different experimental groups , e . g . a treatment and a control group . 5 . Blinding Describe whether the investigators were blinded to group allocation during data collection and / or analysis . Blinding is not relevant to our study because we knew the identity of every measured FP . Note : all studies involving animals and / or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used . 6 . Statistical parameters For all figures and tables that use statistical methods , confirm that the following items are present in relevant figure legends ( or in the Methods section if additional space is needed ) . n / a Confirmed The exact sample size ( n ) for each experimental group / condition , given as a discrete number and unit of measurement ( animals , litters , cultures , etc . ) A description of how samples were collected , noting whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly A statement indicating how many times each experiment was replicated The statistical test ( s ) used and whether they are one - or two - sided ( note : only common tests should be described solely by name ; more complex techniques should be described in the Methods section ) A description of any assumptions or corrections , such as an adjustment for multiple comparisons The test results ( e . g .

Describe the sample preparation . Three replicate cultures for every avFP were grown overnight in M9 rich media at 37°C . Next day , a first set of replicates was diluted 1000X in fresh M9 rich media and incubated at 37°C . After 20 min , the same procedure was followed for the second set of replicates and , finally , after an additional 20 more minutes the third set was also diluted and incubated . The delay between replicates was set to minimize maturation time artifacts in the in vivo brightness determination using flow cytometry . Typically , a single set of replicates would take ~ 6min to be quantified . After 2hrs 40min from the first dilution , a second 500x dilution was performed for every set of replicates following the same time delay . After 2hrs , the replicates were growing exponentially ( OD600 = 0 . 05 - 0 . 1 ) . An aliquot of the first set was transferred to a 96 - well plate pre warmed to 37°C and stored in a styrofoam box . Immediately , samples were measured in a BD LSR Fortessa . The same was done for the second and the third bio - replicate sets . 6 . Identify the instrument used for data collection . Samples were measured in a BD LSR Fortessa . The excitation / emission configuration was CFP Ex 440 ( laser ) , Em 470 / 20 ; GFP Ex 488 ( laser ) , Em 520 / 35 ; and YFP Ex 488 ( laser ) , Em 542 / 27 . 7 .

Greater than 95 % 9 . Describe the gating strategy used . For green FPs , cell - like objects were separated from a clear debris fraction by using the side and forward scattering . Then , cell objects were identified by gating only events with green fluorescence ( FITC channel ) . The same was done for yellow FPs and cyan FPs . For the latter , the cyan channel was used in the second gaiting . We have exemplified the gating strategy in Supplementary Figure 11 .
