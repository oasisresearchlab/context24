It is localized beneath the inner membrane where it organizes the elongasome 9 complex . Depletion or deletion of mreB results in loss of rod shape and cell death ; however , the mechanism 10 of how MreB operates is not known , given that the protein cannot be purified in a functionally intact form . 11 Past studies have reported mutations in mreB cause varying degrees of cell shape and size alterations based 12 on the type and position of the substitution . To better understand the role of MreB in rod shape formation 13 we have taken the first truly systematic approach by replacing the native copy of mreB with an alanine - 14 scanning mutagenesis library . Surprisingly , we observed stably growing spherical mutants that have lost 15 MreB’s function ( s ) for shape regulation without losing viability . Hence , MreB has vital functions related 16 to growth in addition to shape maintenance that can be separated . In support of this , rod shape suppressor 17 analysis of these spherical mutants only revealed reversions or intragenic mreB mutations , suggesting that 18 MreB is indispensable for rod shape . Additionally , our results imply the elongasome is no longer active in 19 these strains , suggesting a novel way for rod shaped bacteria to synthesize cell wall . 20 21 Introduction 22 The cell shape of bacteria is determined by the extracellular peptidoglycan ( PG ) cell wall and is 1 – 8 tightly 23 maintained to ensure efficient growth , division , and survival 1 , 9 , 10 . Loss of PG in rod bacteria results in the 24 formation of osmosensitive spherical L - forms in which rod shape can be regained upon new cell wall 25 synthesis in an MreB dependent manner 2 , 7 , 11 – 14 . Most rod shaped bacteria maintain their shape due to the 26 activity of a complex of proteins termed the ‘elongasome’ or ‘rod system’ 10 , 15 , 16 . The elongasome consists 27 of a partner SEDS ( Shape , elongation , division and sporulation ) family transglycosylase ( RodA ) and 28 penicillin binding protein ( PBP ) transpeptidase ( PBP2 ) , in addition to the bifunctional enzyme PBP1A to 29 promote cylindrical growth in addition to MreCD 17 , 18 . Although their function in unknown , it has been 30 suggested that MreC regulates the elongasome through PBP2 and RodA activation while MreD may 31 suppress such interactions 19 – 23 . These enzymes are regulated by MreB whose localization and 32 polymerization are affected by the transmembrane protein RodZ 24 – 27 . MreB is biologically active as cell 33 membrane associated polymeric antiparallel double nanofilaments in the cytoplasm 25 , 28 – 32 . Rod - shaped 34 bacteria may carry one ( E . coli , Enterobacteriaceae , Caulobacter crescentus , Anabaena , Nostoc ) or two 35 or multiple paralogs ( Thermotoga maritima , Bacillus , Spiroplasma ) of MreB 33 – 42 . In E . coli , MreB is 36 localized to the central cylindrical region of the cell in multiple discrete patches correlating to the location 37 of new PG synthesis 24 , 25 , 30 , 32 , 43 – 48 . The exact mechanism of how MreB operates is not completely 38 understood . 39 As the main protein for rod shape maintenance MreB is not only essential for rod shape but also growth . 40 In B . subtilis , which has three paralogs mreB , mbl and mbH , the triple deletion mutation is lethal while 41 loss of any one paralog results in distorted shape 37 . In C . crescentus , depletion of mreB leads to lemon - 42 shaped cells while deletion of mreB is lethal 34 , 36 , 49 . In E . coli , depletion or deletion of mreB , or any other 43 mre proteins , leads to loss of rod shape and eventually cell death 50 . While MreB appears to be essential 44 for viability it can be suppressed through very slow growth or the overexpression of the division proteins , 45 FtsZAQ , or their regulator SdiA , suggesting that the original discovery of these genes was in a strain with 46 increased levels of FtsZAQ 51 – 54 . While these suppressors allow cells to grow without mreB they do not 47 restore shape , suggesting the MreB is essential for rod shape 1 , 50 , 51 , 55 . 48 While it has been established that MreB is necessary for rod shape , how MreB achieves this is not known . 49 Past studies suggest MreB acts upstream of other shape determinants , as point - mutations can modulate 50 one or more morphological parameters to create different rod - like shapes 56 . Early studies focused on the 51 conserved motifs of the Actin / Hsp70 superfamily in different bacterial MreBs . In B . subtilis , introduction 52 of a mutation in the phosphate 2 motif of MreB that corresponds to the lowering of ATPase activity of 53 eukaryotic actin leads to longer MreB filaments resulting in shape and growth defects and the 54 mislocalization of other mreB isoforms 57 . In C . crescentus , cells were selected for A22 resistance and 55 screened for cell shape defects . Mutations in mreB that modulate cell shape were enriched for in the 56 nucleotide - binding pocket of MreB at the same conserved motifs as tested in B . subtilis 58 , 59 . While in E . 57 coli , A22 has been used to find mreB mutations that alter cell width 46 . Long term evolution experiments 58 also identified MreB mutations resulting in altered morphology and changes in growth rate 60 – 62 . The most 59 comprehensive study of MreB involved FACS - sorting cells for shape defects from a plasmid 60 complementation library of mreB mutants generated through error - prone PCR mutagenesis . They 61 identified a number of point mutations modulating cell size without affecting growth rate in E . coli 56 . In 62 some instances different morphologies are obtained when different amino acids are substituted at the 63 same position 27 , 33 , 46 , 63 . Together these observations suggest amino acid residue and position can 64 independently tune rod - shape . 65 Each of these prior experiments has drawbacks . The use of A22 to isolate mutants is inherently biased as 66 they most likely will not select for mutations across the entire MreB protein and will miss any residues 67 important for shape regulation independent of A22 resistance . The mutations picked from evolution 68 experiments are confounded by the fact that these strains produced multiple mutations in cell shape 69 determinants , not just mreB mutations , and may be specific to the media in which the cells were grown . 70 While complementation of an mreB deletion with a mutant plasmid library allows for an unbiased 71 approach , it possibly introduces copy number effects from the plasmid as well as the possible loss of 72 regulatory sequences . In addition , there may be bias in the possible shapes able to be selected for by cell 73 sorting . The studies on bacteria with multiple MreB isoforms have functional redundancy making the 74 relevancy of homology - based prediction into E . coli MreB ( Ec MreB ) unreliable . 75 The lack of efficient protocols to purify functional mono - or poly - meric MreB from E . coli has hindered 76 any physical and biochemical interrogations , making in - vivo genetic experiments even more important . 77 Hence , this necessitates more work beyond homology - based extrapolation to understand the role of the 78 residue ( s ) involved in shape maintenance and / or determination . To overcome some of these previous 79 biases , we have taken a systematic approach to study Ec MreB by creating a fully functional GFP - tagged 80 native - site alanine - scanning mutagenesis library to assess the impact of each residue on cell shape 81 determination . Our construct is chromosomally located at the native site making it the sole copy of MreB 82 under its native promoter and regulatory elements . Here , we present a detailed shape analysis of the 337 - 83 point mutants in this library with an emphasis on 27 spherical mutants . Our results suggest that MreB has 84 independent functions for rod shape maintenance and growth . A rod shape suppressor screen supports the 85 idea that MreB is absolutely necessary for rod shape . These spherical mutants are resistant to the PBP2 86 targeting antibiotic mecillinam and A22 suggesting they no longer rely on the elongasome for PG 87 synthesis suggesting a possible novel cell wall synthesis mechanism . 88 RESULTS 89 Most mreB alanine substitutions are viable 90 MreB is an important protein in the regulation of cell shape . While multiple studies have been performed 91 to understand how MreB functions , we still have little idea of how MreB regulates cell shape and the role 92 of individual residues . Past experiments have used antibiotics or plasmid - based systems to make random 93 MreB point mutations 28 , 29 , 34 , 46 , 47 , 50 , 50 , 55 , 56 , 58 , 59 , 63 – 65 . These experiments have shown that different changes at 94 a single amino acid site can tune cell size ; however , there has been a lack of a systematic approach to 95 understanding the role of each amino acid residue in cell shape regulation . 96 To systematically understand how MreB functions , we constructed a native - site GFP - tagged alanine - 97 scanning mutagenesis library of mreB via lambda red recombination . All amino acids were individually 98 changed to an alanine except for the native alanines , which were changed to leucine , and the initiating 99 methionine , which was left unchanged . The construct used to make the gene replacements has msf GFP 100 fused to mreB 46 in an internal non - conserved loop ( sandwich fusion ) with flanking regions of homology 101 on both sides of mreB and a kanamycin resistance cassette ( Fig . S1A ) . Cells expressing the lambda red 102 plasmid PKD46 were transformed with the constructs , selected on kanamycin LB agar plates , and 103 screened for GFP fluorescence . The strains with mutations downstream of the GFP were sequenced to 104 ensure the desired recombination occurred . Out of the 346 amino acids of MreB , we were unable to make 105 nine amino acid substitutions ( Table S1 , Fig . S1C ) leaving us with a library of 337 mutants . Seven of 106 these mutations do not occur in suspected self - interaction regions of MreB which were thought to be 107 important for MreB assembly and function . Our inability to successfully transform strains with the mutant 108 mreB alleles suggests these residues are important for viability . In support of this , these residues are 109 highly conserved among both Gram - negative and Gram - positive species ( Table S1 ) . 110 E . coli can stably grow as spheres 111 To determine the role of each residue of mreB on cell shape we imaged the entire library grown in LB at 112 37°C . Due to the large number of strains that were imaged we arrayed the mutants in 96 - well plates with a 113 wild - type ( WT ) strain in each plate and fixed the cells before imaging . A Δ rodZ mutant was included as a 114 control for a non - rod shape phenotype . To keep all cells in exponential phase we serially diluted the 115 cultures as previously done ( see materials and methods ) . Cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde to 116 preserve their shape and fluorescence during the imaging process . Surprisingly , this initial screening 117 revealed a wide variety of cell shape phenotypes , with some mutants having disrupted shapes similar to 118 Δ rodZ cells . 119 Because MreB is known to be involved in rod shape determination we expected many mutations to affect 120 rod shape . However , based on past experiments we did not expect to find a complete loss of rod shape as 121 this was expected to be lethal . To quantify how rod - like cells are , we measured the coefficient of variation 122 of the intracellular diameter deviation ( IDD ) of all cells in the library . This metric measures the standard 123 deviation of the cell diameter across the long access of the cell 25 . The more spherical a cell is the larger 124 the IDD , as a rod will only have changes to its diameter at the poles . Due to the number of mutants 125 observed we grouped cells into a histogram based on IDD values . Most of the MreB mutants have either 126 no change in rod shape or a distorted rod - like shape phenotype ( left side of the histogram ) ; however , we 127 observed mutants with shape defects beyond the rod - like spectrum ( Fig . 1 ) . The cells that have the least 128 rod - like shape ( the last four bins in Fig . 1A ) were reimaged using live cell imaging . As the length of a rod 129 will determine what percent of the cell is a pole , thereby effecting the IDD value ( Fig . S2A ) ; therefore , 130 we measured the aspect ratio of the cells in last four bins from the IDD histogram and found that the 131 average aspect ratio for each bin was 3 . 03 ± 0 . 43 , 2 . 70 ± 0 . 47 , 2 . 67 ± 0 . 45 and 2 . 14 ± 0 . 12 respectively . 132 Using an aspect ratio of 3 as a cutoff for rod - shape , the last three bins will be considered non - rod - like and 133 excluded from future cell shape analysis . Interestingly the ∆ rodZ mutant has the highest IDD value in the 134 penultimate bin indicating that the strains in the black bin have completely lost rod shape . 135 Spherical mreB point mutant do not have known suppressor mutations 136 Because it was unexpected to be able to stably grow spherical E . coli with a broken MreB , we performed 137 whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) to check for the presence of known suppressor mutations . We chose 138 ten of the spherical mutants for WGS and found no mutations in the PG synthesis machinery ( elongasome 139 and divisome components ) , their known regulators , nor their promoter regions . However , we did find that 140 our parental MG1655 WT strain used to make the library contain a point mutation in the bifunctional 141 ppGpp hydrolase / synthetase , spoT ( spoT A26E ) , while the WT fluorescent strain ( NO50 ) does not ( Tables 142 S2 - 3 ) . The levels of ppGpp have been shown to regulate cell size and may be linked to mecillinam 143 resistance in E . coli 66 , 67 . SpoT is the major hydrolase for ppGpp with weak synthetase activity 68 , 69 . While 144 this mutation is outside of the known synthetase activity region ( amino acids 67 - 374 ) it falls within the 145 hydrolase region and may be affecting intracellular levels of ppGpp and helping to stabilize mutants with 146 a broken MreB 70 . To test if this mutation aids in the viability of our round mutants , we moved the WT 147 mreB - GFP sw fusion into the parental MG1655 WT strain ( spoT A26E ) and compared its susceptibility to A22 148 and mecillinam with that of the MG1655 ( spoT A26E ) and our fluorescent NO50 parent ( spoT WT ) . If this 149 spotT mutation was changing ppGpp levels , we would expect to see increased mecillinam resistance . We 150 found that the spoT A26E mutation does not lead to A22 or mecillinam resistance suggesting that the 151 spoT A26E mutation does not provide any advantage for viability and growth for the mutants in this study . 152 Hence , the growth of these spherical mutants suggests MreB may be playing a key role in viability that is 153 separate from its role in cell shape determination . 154 Spherical strains have a variety of MreB localization patterns 155 A point mutation in mreB could lead to loss of rod shape due to lower levels of MreB , loss of interaction 156 with an elongasome component , loss of self - interactions , changes to polymer characteristics , or changes 157 to ATP binding / hydrolysis . We observed that the round mutants have both different MreB localization 158 patterns and fluorescence intensities . A loss of monomer - monomer interactions should result in 159 cytoplasmic localization of MreB , which is seen in four mutants ( Fig . 1D , circle head ) , although none 160 have mutations in the predicted monomer - monomer interface 71 . Similarly , we would expect mutations that 161 block protofilament interactions to have most of the MreB in the cytoplasm . Again , we see multiple 162 mutants with either only cytoplasmic or mostly cytoplasmic MreB localization ( few noticeable foci ) 163 without having mutations in the predicted protofilament interface ( single arrowhead ) 28 . WT MreB forms 164 multiple foci across the cell body . This phenotype is seen in multiple mutants suggesting that 165 polymerization is not broken in these strains ( double arrowhead ) , of which two , R65A and V181A lie in 166 the predicted monomer - monomer interface . The presence of foci suggests the MreB in these mutants has 167 lost the ability to interact with an essential partner resulting in filaments ( foci ) but not rod shape or that 168 these mutations have altered the physical characteristics of the polymers so that they or the elongasome 169 complexes are no longer functional . Lastly , we noticed differences in MreB concentration across the 170 different strains as seen by the fluorescence intensity ( Fig . 1D ) . This further supports MreB having 171 distinct roles for shape regulation and viability as mutants that express lower levels of MreB may not 172 have enough MreB to regulate rod shape but must have a sufficient MreB concentration to support 173 growth . 174 Residues involved in shape and viability are highly conserved 175 After live cell imaging , strains with the most extreme shape defects ( dark bins ) all appear misshapen with 176 a high IDD value ( Fig . 1B , S2B ) . We quantified the growth rate of these mutants in LB at 37°C and found 177 that all strains from these bins have a longer doubling - time than WT cells ( Fig . 1C - D , S2C - D ) . 178 Interestingly , while these strains all have high IDD values , they have different cell sizes ( Fig . 1E , S2E ) 179 suggesting that MreB is being disrupted in separate ways leading to different types of spherical cells . 180 Additionally , MreB localization in the cells with the highest IDD is different , displaying both diffuse 181 signal and discrete aggregates or foci ( Fig . 1D ) . We compared the conservation of the residues that lead to 182 the 27 non rod - shaped mutants in a variety of Gram - negative and positive organisms . 69 . 4 % of the 183 residues that result in nonviable or misshapen cells ( 25 / 36 ) are identical among the tested species 184 compared to only 36 . 3 % of the total protein ( Table S1 ) . The increased conservation of these specific 185 residues over the total protein further supports the conclusion that they are important for MreB functions . 186 Cell width is tightly controlled by MreB 187 MreB has been linked to cell width or rod diameter regulation in C . crescentus and E . coli 46 , 47 , 72 , 73 . To 188 determine which residues are important for width regulation we measured the cell width of all the mutants 189 ( Supp Data ) . Due to plate - to - plate variances in cell growth and size , we calculated the foldchange of the 190 cell width of each mutant to the WT strain in each individual plate and represented the data as a histogram 191 ( Fig . 2A ) . 60 mutants represented by the black bar ( Fig . 2A ) have a low fold change indicating these 192 mutants are thinner than WT . We performed live cell imaging on the 20 mutants with the smallest ratio 193 after growth to early exponential phase ( OD 0 . 2 - 0 . 25 ) . 19 ( 95 % ) were significantly thinner than WT cells 194 and have a decrease of cell width by 6 . 10 % to 22 . 54 % ( p < 0 . 0001 ) with respect to WT cells ( Fig . 2B ) 195 indicating that our initial fixed - cell screen accurately measures thin cells . Previous results found a weak 196 correlation between the width of cells and the coefficient of variation of width ; therefore , we measured 197 the coefficient of variation of width ( CV width ) of these 19 thin mutants and found that almost all of them 198 have a smaller coefficient than WT cells ( Fig . 2C ) suggesting that as cells get thinner , they have a more 199 consistent width across the population 56 . 200 Similarly , 40 mutants distributed over six bins ( grey ) ( Fig . 2A ) have a high foldchange indicating they 201 may be wider than WT cells . These bins include the round mutants with higher IDDs that we are 202 excluding from this analysis ( Fig . 1A ) . Live cell imaging was performed on the 12 remaining strains from 203 these upper bins at an early exponential phase ( OD 0 . 2 - 0 . 25 ) and all were found to be wider than WT ( p 204 < 0 . 0001 ) in agreement with the initial screen ( Fig . 2D ) . Therefore , when including the round mutants , all 205 40 strains are wider than WT suggesting that the initial screen can accurately measure larger cell widths . 206 We measured the coefficient of variation of width and found that these 12 wider cells have a larger 207 coefficient ( Fig . 2E ) suggesting that the width of large cells varies more across the population . Since both 208 the thinnest and fattest cells seem to correlate with the coefficient of variation of width , we measured the 209 correlation of C width to width across the entire fixed cell library . In contrast to previous results , this 210 analysis found a high correlation suggesting that as cell width increases there is more variation in the 211 width across the population ( Pearson’s r = 0 . 8290 ) ( Fig . 2F ) . 212 We performed a second analysis on the cell width by calculating the width foldchange against the plate - 213 wise average cell width to account for intraplate variation . Among the 63 thinnest mutants comprising the 214 black bins ( Fig . S4 ) in this new analysis , 38 overlapped with the previously calculated thin group ( Fig . 2 , 215 S3 ) . We quantified the width of cells after live cell imaging for the four mutants with the smallest ratio 216 out of the 25 remaining strains unique to this analysis . These four show a significant decrease of 0 . 89 % to 217 18 . 11 % ( p < 0 . 0001 , p < 0 . 05 ( V187A ) ) of cell width than WT cells ( Fig . S3B ) . Similarly , 60 mutants in 218 the six dark grey bins ( Fig . S3A ) have a large ratio , suggesting they may be wider than the plate average . 219 After excluding the spherical strains , Δ rodZ , and overlap from the initial analysis , we are left with 16 new 220 strains . We imaged nine of these mutants and found that all of them were significantly wider ( p < 0 . 0001 ) 221 than WT cells showing a total increase of 8 . 06 % to 40 . 38 % increase in cell width ( Fig . S3D ) . Between 222 these two methods we have shown that large - scale imaging of fixed cells accurately represents changes in 223 cell width in both directions . 224 MreB mutations result more in shorter cells 225 The activity of the elongasome adds cell length during the pre - division stage of the cell cycle . The length 226 of E . coli has been linked to division time and hence the activity of the division machinery ( divisome ) 74 , 75 . 227 It is unclear how MreB interacts with the divisome , although in C . crescentus MreB has been shown to 228 condense to the division plane and in E . coli some labs have reported an increase of MreB at the division 229 plane 76 . In E . coli , RodZ localizes at division sites in an FtsZ - dependent manner and RodZ also interacts 230 with MreB ; however , many other labs fail to see MreB localization at the division site in E . coli 26 , 33 , 76 . 231 Additionally , MreB can directly interact with FtsZ which is needed to shift from elongation to division in 232 some bacteria 38 , 77 – 79 . Hence , there may be transient crosstalk between these two complexes . If MreB is 233 involved in regulating division , one would expect to see mutants that are affected for cell length and 234 possibly filamentous cells in our library . 235 As we did for cell width , we measured the cell length foldchange of the mutants to the WT from each 236 plate and the plate - wise average and presented the data as histograms ( Fig . 3 ) . The first analysis yields 65 237 mutants ( black bar , Fig . 3A ) that have a smaller ratio than WT cells suggesting they may be shorter than 238 WT . We quantified the cell length of the 27 mutants with the smallest ratio from this group using live cell 239 imaging and found 21 ( 77 . 78 % ) show significantly decreased cell length by 5 . 26 % to 28 . 25 % ( p < 0 . 0001 ) 240 with most of the strains showing a smaller CV length than WT ( Fig . 3B - C ) , suggesting these point mutants 241 have more control over their cell length than WT . Similarly , 16 mutants ( dark grey ) have a high 242 foldchange indicating they may be longer than WT . 7 of these were excluded from future analysis because 243 they are spherical ( Fig . 1 ) leaving only 9 high ratio mutants . To further test our accuracy on measuring 244 long cells , we looked at the next 7 rod shaped strains with the largest foldchange . Of these 16 mutants , 10 245 ( 62 . 5 % ) were significantly longer showing 3 . 06 % to 39 . 80 % increase in average cell length with a higher 246 CV length than WT after live cell imaging ( Fig . 3D - E ) , although none formed filamentous cells . 247 We calculated the foldchange against the plate - wise average to account for the intraplate variances . 248 Among the 12 shortest mutants ( black bar Fig . 3F ) , 11 overlapped with the previous short mutant list , 249 leaving only one mutant ; therefore , we didn’t examine short mutants from this analysis . Among the 19 250 longest mutants from the four bins ( dark grey , Fig . 3F ) , 6 were round mutants and 2 overlapped with the 251 list from the previous analysis , leaving one WT and 10 possibly long mutants . Among the ten , 7 ( 70 % ) 252 mutants were significantly longer showing 6 . 20 % to 29 . 52 % increase in average cell length with higher 253 variability than WT ( Fig . 3G - H ) after live cell imaging . Collectively , these results suggest longer mutants 254 have less control on regulating cell length . We measured the correlation between the cell length and the 255 coefficient of variation of length in the entire fixed cell library , revealing only a weak correlation ( Fig . 256 3I ) . While the initial large - scale screen and live imaging both accurately report on cell length , it is not as 257 robust as measuring cell width ( Fig . S5 ) . Similarly , there was only a mild correlation between cell length 258 and width where we did not observe long cells within thin mutants ( Fig . 3J ) . Additionally , the fact that we 259 did not observe filamentous cells at all suggests any effects of MreB on FtsZ function is minimal . 260 MreB is absolutely necessary for rod shape 261 When the main proteins of the elongasome are inhibited , cells become spherical , suggesting each of these 262 proteins is important for rod shape . Previous studies using the spherical rodZ mutant identified suppressor 263 mutants in mreB and other elongasome proteins that rescue rod shape , indicating that RodZ is not 264 necessary for rod shape 24 , 25 , 27 . Due to the essential nature of MreB it has been difficult to do similar 265 experiments to test if MreB is necessary for rod shape . We found 27 mutants that stably grow as spheres 266 allowing us to test the hypothesis that unlike RodZ , MreB is required for rod shape . 267 To determine if MreB is in fact necessary for rod shape determination we performed a suppressor screen 268 on six of the spherical mutants with different MreB fluorescent patterns ( Fig . 1D and Table 1 ) to screen 269 for different MreB defects . We used sublethal concentration of the PBP3 targeting antibiotic cephalexin to 270 select for rod - shape suppressors . We found rod shaped mutants for four of the round - shaped parents ; 271 I15A , M90A , P108A and V181A ( Table 1 ) . We sequenced the mreB from a selection of the rod - shaped 272 mutants and found that almost all strains have reversions back to the WT mreB sequence . The two 273 mutants of the P108A spherical parent have intragenic mutation in mreB : F84V and G168A ( Fig . 4 ) . To 274 further confirm that these mutations are the cause of the restoration of rod shape we performed WGS on 275 these two strains and did not find any additional mutations ( Table 1 ) . Transduction of the mreB double 276 mutants into a clean WT background results in a rod - shaped cell ( data not shown ) . Together these results 277 suggest the suppression comes from this second mreB mutation and that MreB is absolutely required for 278 rod shape . 279 To quantify the suppressive effects of the F84V and G168A mutations we measured the IDD of both 280 single and double mutants compared to WT ( Fig . 4C ) . We found that as previously reported F84V forms a 281 misshapen rod , while G168A has minimal effect on rod shape 46 . Both double mutant strains show a 282 decrease in IDD , but G168A restores the rod shape to P108A better than F84V most likely due to the 283 shape of the G168A parent being more rod - like than F184V ( Fig . 4A ) . As the spherical P108A was shown 284 to have a growth defect ( Fig . 1D ) , we also measured the growth rate of the suppressors and found that 285 they have faster doubling times than parent P108A ( Fig . 4D ) . Collectively , all these observations suggest 286 mreB is central in determining and maintaining rod - shape and cannot be bypassed . 287 Spherical mreB mutants no longer use the elongasome 288 Round E . coli , such as when rodZ is deleted or our spherical mutants , must have a cell wall , as wall less 289 cells ( L - forms ) would not be able to grow in these conditions . It is unclear how spherical E . coli builds 290 their wall . A22 treatment is thought to depolymerize MreB thereby inactivating the rod system . ∆ rodZ 291 cells have been hypothesized to be round due to the mislocalization of MreB and therefore the 292 elongasome , while A22 treated cells are thought to lack elongasome activity all together . As we can stably 293 grow spherical mreB mutants , we hypothesize that they must be producing a cell wall in an MreB - 294 independent manner . To confirm MreB is no longer active in these round mutants we grew the 18 strains 295 with the highest IDD ( Fig . 1 ) with and without A22 ( 10µg / mL ) for six hours and determined the growth 296 ratio between A22 and LB only conditions . All round mutants were able to grow better than the WT strain 297 in A22 indicating that even in the absence of A22 these mutants do not have functional MreB to organize 298 and coordinate the elongasome complex ( Fig . 5A ) . 299 The A22 resistance of the spherical mutants suggests the elongasome is no longer functioning . To further 300 test this we examined the MIC of these mutants to mecillinam , which targets the elongasome component 301 PBP2 . All round mutants are resistant to mecillinam by > 30 - fold over WT cells ( Table 2 ) clearly 302 suggesting the elongasome is no longer necessary in these strains . This could be explained if a different 303 PG synthesis machinery is being used in these strains . The elongasome complexes account for most of the 304 synthesis of new PG strands during cylindrical growth ; however , there are other components like the 305 aPBPs , and the divisome that can contribute to the upkeep of the PG layer . To determine if other PBPs 306 substitute for the elongasome we measured their MICs against the PBP - targeting antibiotics : cefsulodin 307 ( aPBPs ) , ampicillin ( multiple PBPs ) , and cephalexin ( PBP3 ) . All round mutants are more susceptible to 308 cefsulodin and cephalexin , except for I15A , while all are more sensitive to ampicillin compared to WT 309 ( Table 2 ) . This implies the other PBPs may have a greater role in PG synthesis independent of MreB or 310 the elongasome in these spherical mutants . It is possible that FtsZ is driving this synthesis as these 311 mutants are sensitive to the inhibition of PBP3 which is part of the division machinery ; however , there 312 may be a novel mechanism for PG upkeep that is independent of both MreB and FtsZ . 313 Discussion 314 MreB is a conditionally essential bacterial actin homolog responsible for rod shape determination . Rod 315 shape can be defined by multiple parameters , such as aspect ratio and cylindrical uniformity , which have 316 been shown to be independently regulated by MreB 33 . In - vitro molecular - level visualization of Ec MreB is 317 not feasible ; therefore , high quality in - vivo studies are required . To this end we made an alanine - scanning 318 native - site MreB mutant library to use genetics to provide insights on the influence of each residue of 319 MreB on cell shape regulation . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first truly systematic study of 320 MreB . As previously reported , we have demonstrated that specific MreB residue can independently tune 321 cell shape . In addition , we discovered amino acid changes that allow cells to grow as spheres in 322 conditions not permissive for growth of an mreB deletion , suggesting that MreB has distinct roles in rod 323 shape determination and viability . In support of these two distinct roles for MreB , some residues appear to 324 be critical for viability as we were unable to make nine mutations ( Table S1 ) . The identification of 325 residues essential for rod shape but not viability alone shows MreB’s role for shape regulation and 326 viability can be separated and investigated ( Fig . 1 ) . Here we use the spherical mutants to show that mreB 327 is absolutely required for rod shape determination and cannot be bypassed by additional mutations , unlike 328 a rodZ deletion in which rod shape is restored by mutations in many elongasome proteins , and that the 329 elongasome is no longer functioning in these cells 24 , 27 . 330 MreB is an actin homolog 331 The actin superfamily is defined by conserved structural motifs needed for ATP binding / hydrolysis and 332 polymerization . MreB has all of the structural features one would expect in an actin , including the ability 333 to bind ATP with the nucleotide binding pocket or cleft between domains I and II 28 , 41 , 71 , 80 , 81 . 334 The different nucleotide states modulate actin structural transitions by affecting filament dynamics and 335 have been shown to be important in MreB polymerization in molecular dynamic simulatins 82 . Mutations 336 in the ATP hydrolytic or phosphate interacting motifs of actin lead to cells with poor or no growth 29 , 83 – 85 . 337 Mutations in the ATP binding pocket in both B . subtilis and C . crescentus affect cell shape 57 , 58 . Some of 338 the spherical mutants we observed are in or around this ATP binding cleft or pocket . For instance , the 339 I166A and G167A mutations are in a conserved phosphate binding loop and lead to a round phenotype , 340 while A298L and L300A are in the same cleft and result in similar shape defects . Taken together this 341 indicates the significance of the proposed ATP - binding cleft in affecting nucleotide activity and therefore 342 cell shape . 343 Similarly , the release of inorganic phosphate is a crucial event for actin filament polymerization . In actin , 344 the phosphate escape channel ( N111 - R177 ) is gated by asparagine and arginine residues . An N111S 345 mutation causes rapid release of P i possibly due to absence of steric hindrance by the serine substitution 86 . 346 Interestingly , in Ec MreB the structural equivalent to N111 is a A118 , suggesting a lack of gating . We 347 observed that an A118L mutation in results in a round shape - phenotype with a slow doubling time . If 348 Ec MreB has a similar P i escape channel as actin the substitution to leucine may introduce steric hindrance 349 that affects P i release . 350 Cations associate with ATP and influence actin filament polymerization and stability 87 . In yeast , mutating 351 some of these charged residues in combination was shown to be lethal , again suggesting that single 352 mutants might not be sufficient to explore important residues 84 . In multiple bacterial species , it has been 353 shown that MreB assembly and stability respond to cation ( Ca + + and Mg + + ; Na + and K + ) concentration in 354 vitro 31 , 88 – 91 . Mutations in these proposed Ec MreB cation binding residues have minimal effect on cell 355 shape , suggesting these MreB variants retain elongasome function . Overall , our results indicate that there 356 may be structural differences between members of the actin superfamily that are only revealed upon 357 genetic perturbations . Additionally , there is a need to test predicted residues with multiple amino acid 358 changes or to make multiple mutations in important domains to fully examine the importance of specific 359 residues . 360 Predicted residues for MreB interactions are not important for cell shape regulation 361 In our growth conditions an mreB deletion would be lethal ; therefore , we expected to observe lethality for 362 residues critical for MreB assembly and function . Some residues may be essential for monomer - monomer 363 or double protofilament interactions 92 . As MreB forms antiparallel filaments it would have been expected 364 that mutations at the predicted monomer interfaces or at the protofilament interfaces would have a large 365 effect on cell shape or growth . Unlike a previous study where a V121E ( protofilament interface ) and 366 S284D ( monomer - monomer interface ) mutations create extreme shape defects hypothesized to be due to 367 defects in MreB polymerization 28 , the corresponding alanine substitution in our library maintain rod 368 shape . In fact , most of the mutants on predicted interface interactions are rod shaped . This previous study 369 expressed the mutant mreB from a plasmid in a strain constitutively expressing sdiA . The fact that we 370 don’t see large cell shape changes from most of the mutations in these or other predicted residues could 371 be due to the nature of the alanine itself , the fact that our mutants are single copy chromosomal insertions , 372 or because multiple residues are involved in such interfaces and the effect of a single substitution is 373 minimal . 374 mreB point mutations can separate its viability and shape control functions 375 Out of nine residues that could not be mutated , a previous study has reported different amino acid 376 substitution ( s ) for seven : G134 , L293 , L303 , P304 , A332 , L307 and M335 56 , indicating that while alanine 377 substitution may not be viable , other classes of amino acids are . In total , these results suggest at least two 378 residues , T119 and E281 , may be critical for viability while the specific amino acid change is vital for 379 MreB function in others . 380 Some point mutants appear to cause cells to significantly lose rod shape , while still being able to grow . 381 These residues must be important for MreBs function in regulating rod shape , although the exact role that 382 each residue plays is still unknown . The fact that these mutants can lose rod shape but still grow suggests 383 that MreB independently regulates rod shape and viability . 384 In previous studies it was shown elevated FtsZAQ levels can suppress lethality of spherical E . coli cells in 385 an mre - background without restoring rod shape 50 , 51 . The viability of our round mutants without any 386 known suppressor mutations has the equivalent effect of FtsZ overexpression , stable round shape growth . 387 This indicates these mutants have retained the viability function but lost the rod shape regulation function . 388 Taken together , this suggests the two functions of MreB of cell shape regulation and viability can be 389 separated . 390 Intragenic mreB mutations suppress the round shape - phenotype 391 Previously , elongasome components were shown to restore rod shape in a rodZ mutant 24 , 27 . While it has 392 been suggested that MreB is necessary for rod shape , similar suppressor screens have been unfeasible 393 until now . To determine if MreB can be bypassed in a similar manner to RodZ we attempted to find 394 suppressors of the cell shape defect in six of the spherical mutants ( Table 1 ) . While most of the mutations 395 we found were reversions back to WT , we did identify two rod - shape suppressors in the P108A parent . 396 Both suppressors are intragenic to mreB ( Fig . 4 ) . To confirm these intragenic mutations are the cause of 397 suppression we performed WGS on the double mutants and moved these mutations into a fresh WT 398 background via transduction . In support of the fact that these intragenic mutations are the cause of 399 suppression there were no additional mutations in genes involved in PG synthesis or regulators in the 400 double mutant when compared to the P108A parents and the transductants remain rod shaped ( data not 401 shown ) . G168A is a better suppressor of the round shape than F84V ( Fig . 4C ) and is in the ATP binding 402 pocket . It may influence ATP binding / hydrolysis possibly leading to a more stable polymers 92 . In support 403 of this , the G168A mutation results in A22 resistance ( Fig . 5 ) . The suppressor strain with the 404 P108AG168A mutation is much more sensitive to mecillinam than the P108A parent , suggesting it may 405 have restored the elongasome activity that was lost in the P108A parent . Overall , the results suggest the 406 shape maintaining function of MreB cannot be compensated by other elongasome components making 407 MreB essential for rod - shape maintenance . 408 Round mutants’ PG synthesis may be independent of elongasome activity 409 The activity of PBP2 , a transpeptidase ( TP ) that crosslinks muropeptide strands is crucial for elongasome 410 activity . The loss of rod shape in our round mutants suggests that the activity of the elongasome is 411 perturbed . To test this , we measured the susceptibility of 18 round mutants to mecillinam , an 412 amidinopenicillin that specifically inhibits the TP activity of PBP2 . All the mutants tested were resistant 413 ( > 30 folds than WT ) , suggesting that PBP2 activity is no longer required and therefore that the 414 elongasome is not functioning in these mutants ( Table 2 ) . In addition , we measured the MIC of these 415 mutants against cefsulodin ( targets : PBP1A and PBP1B ) and cephalexin ( targets PBP3 ) . All mutants but 416 one ( I15A ) were more sensitive to them indicating other major PBPs may have a greater role in PG 417 synthesis in these strains ( Table 2 ) . PBP3 is part of the divisome suggesting that there may be increased 418 divisome activity in these mutants and FtsZ has been shown to direct PG incorporation into the lateral cell 419 wall when MreB is perturbed 93 . This suggests that the suppressive nature of overexpression of FtsZAQ is 420 not due to making a larger Z - ring as previously suggested , but rather to increasing general cell wall 421 synthesis allowing the cells to grow without a functioning elongasome . 422 Materials and Methods 423 Bacterial growth 424 Bacteria were grown using standard laboratory conditions . Unless stated otherwise , cultures were grown 425 overnight in LB medium ( 10 g / L NaCl , 10 g / L tryptone , 5 g / L yeast extract ) and subcultured in the 426 morning 1 : 1000 at 37 o C in a shaking incubator . 427 Library construction 428 An ordered array of alanine or lysine substitutions was made by Twist Bioscience consisting of a linear 429 DNA molecule including DNA upstream of mreB , a kanamycin resistance cassette , and the mreBCD 430 operon ( Fig S1A ) . Each construct has a gfp - sandwich fusion between a non - conserved loop of mreB 46 . 431 The constructs were amplified using PCR and transformed into an E . coli MG1655 strain with the PKD46 432 plasmid that facilitates λ - red recombination 94 . The recombinants were selected on LB plates 433 supplemented with kanamycin ( 30 μg / mL ) at 30°C and screened for GFP fluorescence . Suspension of 434 desired colonies were incubated at 42°C to cure them of PKD46 plasmid . Recombinants with mutations 435 near the C - terminal region of mreB were sequence verified to ensure proper recombination occurred . 436 Library fixation 437 Strains were sub - cultured in 96 - well plates from freezer stocks in LB overnight at 37°C . Overnight 438 cultures were diluted 1 : 1000 in fresh medium and grown for three hours . Cultures were 1 : 1000 diluted 439 into fresh medium and grown for two more hours and then diluted 1 : 1000 a second time to keep the in 440 exponential phase and grew for two hours . Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes , 441 washed with PBS three times and resuspended in PBS . 442 Microscopy 443 For initial imaging of the library see Library Fixation for cell prep . For all live cell imaging , cultures were 444 diluted to equal numbers ( 0 . 1 OD ) and 2 μL of suspension was inoculated into 2 mL of LB and incubated 445 at 37°C to early exponential phase ( 0 . 2 to 0 . 25 OD ) . All analysis from live cells includes data pooled from 446 three independent experiments . 447 All imaging was done on 1 % M63 - glucose agarose pads at room temperature . Phase contrast and 448 fluorescent images were collected on a Nikon Ni - E epifluorescent microscope equipped with a 100X / 1 . 45 449 NA objective ( Nikon ) , Zyla 4 . 2 plus cooled sCMOS camera ( Andor ) , and NIS Elements software 450 ( Nikon ) . 451 Cell shape statistics were calculated using the MATLAB software Morphometrics 56 , and custom software 452 as described previously 25 . Only single non - diving cells were used for analysis unless stated otherwise . For 453 a list of data from the fixed cell imaging see supplemental data file 1 . Pearson correlation coefficient was 454 used to analyze relationships between sets and Student’s t test was used for statistical analyses . All data 455 from the fixed cell imaging can be found in supplemental data file . 456 Growth rate analyses 457 Overnight cultures were grown in LB at 37°C and diluted in LB in equal numbers ( 0 . 1 OD ) as described 458 previously . 1 μL of the suspension was inoculated into 100 μL of LB in 96 - well plates for each strain with 459 at least three biological replicates on each plate and repeated three times . Plates were incubated at 37°C 460 shaking for 16hr in a Biotek plate reader . Doubling times are reported as the max doubling time as 461 determined by the maximal instantaneous growth rate . 462 Suppressor screen analysis 463 Overnight cultures were grown in LB at 37°C and diluted in LB in equal numbers ( 0 . 1 OD ) as described 464 previously and grown to 0 . 3 OD . 100 μLs of cells were plated onto LB plates supplemented with differing 465 concentrations of cephalexin ( 3 . 0 , 4 . 0 , 5 . 0 , 6 . 0 & 7 . 0 μg / mL ) in triplicate and incubated overnight at 466 37°C . Isolated colonies were suspended in 10 μL LB and imaged to analyze the cell shape . 467 Sequencing 468 For whole - genome sequencing , genomic DNA was extracted from strains from overnight cultures using 469 Qiagen DNeasy Blood and tissue kit . Illumina sequencing was performed by MIGS ( now SeqCenter ) and 470 variant analysis was performed using Breseq 95 . 471 For single construct sequencing , the entire mreB cloning construct or spoT were PCR amplified and 472 sequenced using nanopore technology ( Plasmidsaurus ) . 473 Mapping mutations 474 Pymol was used to map the mutations on the AlphaFold model of Ec MreB . 475 Antibiotic sensitivity profiling 476 Overnight cultures were diluted into equal numbers ( 0 . 1 OD ) and 1 μL was inoculated into 100 μL of LB 477 supplemented with a gradient of antibiotic concentrations of two - fold dilutions . Mecillinam ( 512 μg / mL ) , 478 Cephalexin ( 16 μg / mL ) , Cefsulodin ( 16 μg / mL ) and Ampicillin ( 16 μg / mL ) . Plates were incubated at 479 37°C for 16h with shaking . The MIC was defined as the concentration of drug that resulted in an OD less 480 than 0 . 1 times the OD of the control well without any drug . For six - hour growth ratio assay , overnight 481 cultures were inoculated in equal numbers into 2mL of LB with and without with different antibiotic 482 concentrations ( For A22 , 1 . 0 and 10μg / mL ) and incubated at 37°C for 6h with shaking .
