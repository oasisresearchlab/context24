Hansen 2 , Sourav Ganguly 2 , rongdiao Liu 1 , Alec Heckert 2 , Xavier Darzacq 2 & Qiang Zhou 2 * Hyperphosphorylation of the C - terminal domain ( CTD ) of the RPB1 subunit of human RNA polymerase ( Pol ) II is essential for transcriptional elongation and mRNA processing 1 – 3 . The CTD contains 52 heptapeptide repeats of the consensus sequence YSPTSPS . The highly repetitive nature and abundant possible phosphorylation sites of the CTD exert special constraints on the kinases that catalyse its hyperphosphorylation . Positive transcription elongation factor b ( P - TEFb ) —which consists of CDK9 and cyclin T1—is known to hyperphosphorylate the CTD and negative elongation factors to stimulate Pol II elongation 1 , 4 , 5 . The sequence determinant on P - TEFb that facilitates this action is currently unknown . Here we identify a histidine - rich domain in cyclin T1 that promotes the hyperphosphorylation of the CTD and stimulation of transcription by CDK9 . The histidine - rich domain markedly enhances the binding of P - TEFb to the CTD and functional engagement with target genes in cells . In addition to cyclin T1 , at least one other kinase—DYRK1A 6 —also uses a histidine - rich domain to target and hyperphosphorylate the CTD . As a low - complexity domain , the histidine - rich domain also promotes the formation of phase - separated liquid droplets in vitro , and the localization of P - TEFb to nuclear speckles that display dynamic liquid properties and are sensitive to the disruption of weak hydrophobic interactions . The CTD—which in isolation does not phase separate , despite being a low - complexity domain—is trapped within the cyclin T1 droplets , and this process is enhanced upon pre - phosphorylation by CDK7 of transcription initiation factor TFIIH 1 – 3 . By using multivalent interactions to create a phase - separated functional compartment , the histidine - rich domain in kinases targets the CTD into this environment to ensure hyperphosphorylation and efficient elongation of Pol II . Among all transcription - related cyclins , cyclin ( CYC ) T—which includes T1 ( CYCT1 ) and T2—has the longest C - terminal regions . In CYCT1 , the N - terminal region is structured and contains the cyc - lin - box repeats required for binding and activating CDK9 , whereas the C - terminal region has only a few isolated motifs and is mostly unstruc - tured ( Fig . 1a ) . To determine whether the CYCT1 C - terminal region is important for regulating CDK9 activity , we performed in vitro kinase reactions to examine affinity - purified CDK9 – CYCT1 – Flag heterodimers that contained various truncated forms of CYCT1 with progressively short - ened C termini to phosphorylate the CTD ( Fig . 1a and Extended Data Fig . 1a ) . A mixture of glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) – CTD 52 ( RPB1 CTD containing all 52 repeats ) and GST – CTD 9 ( CTD containing 9 consensus repeats ) was used in all reactions as the kinase substrates . The various CYCT1 truncations did not substantially affect the abil - ity of the associated CDK9 to autophosphorylate by producing the ATP - dependent mobility shift ( Fig . 1a ) , nor did the truncations decrease the phosphorylation of CTD 9 . However , upon truncation to a position at and beyond 533 , CDK9 became largely unable to produce the hyper - phosphorylated CTD 52 ( hereafter , IIo ) as revealed by the anti - phospho - Ser5 antibody 3E8 ( Fig . 1a ) . A similar pattern was also detected with the anti - phospho - Ser2 antibody 3E10 ( Extended Data Fig . 1b ) . Thus , a region around position 533 in CYCT1 promoted the hyperphospho - rylation by CDK9 of CTD 52 . To determine whether the CYCT1 C - terminal truncations affect the transcriptional activity of P - TEFb , we used the Gal4 - tethering sys - tem to test fusion proteins containing the Gal4 DNA - binding domain attached to the various truncated forms of CYCT1 to activate lucif - erase expression from the HIV - 1 promoter containing Gal4 - binding sites ( Fig . 1b ) . Correlating with the kinase results , progressive CYCT1 C - terminal truncations to and beyond position 533 markedly reduced P - TEFb transcriptional activity ( Fig . 1b ) . The coiled - coil domain ( CCD , amino acids 379 – 430 ) and the histi - dine - rich domain ( HRD , amino acids 480 – 550 ) exist around position 533 ( Fig . 1a ) . In kinase reactions , only the deletion of HRD ( Δ HRD ) but not CCD ( Δ CCD ) blocked the hyperphosphorylation by CDK9 of CTD 52 ( Fig . 1c ) . Consistently , HRD but not CCD was required for P - TEFb transcriptional activity in the Gal4 - tethering assay ( Fig . 1d ) . Dependence on HRD for Tat / P - TEFb - activated HIV - 1 elongation has previously been proposed 7 , and here confirmed by our finding that wild - type CYCT1 but not CYCT1 Δ HRD could effectively rescue the RNAi - knockdown of endogenous CYCT1 expression to produce long ( promoter - distal ) but not short ( promoter - proximal ) viral transcripts ( Fig . 1e ) . The importance of the HRD for the transcriptional activity of P - TEFb was generalized to cellular genes , as CYCT1 Δ HRD pro - duced significantly less mRNA from four representative immediate early genes— FOS , JUNB , MYC and EGR1 —as well as HSP70 - 1 ( also known as HSPA1A ) under both basal and heat - shock conditions ( Extended Data Fig . 2 ) , all of which require P - TEFb for optimal tran - scription . Co - immunoprecipitation analysis ( Fig . 1f and Extended Data Fig . 2e ) shows that the decreased activity of CYCT1 Δ HRD was not due to any substantial change in binding to the major P - TEFb part - ners , including BRD4 and subunits of the super elongation complex and the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle that regulate P - TEFb activity 1 , 4 , 5 . What is the mechanism by which the HRD promotes the activity of P - TEFb ? The first hint came from the finding that wild - type CYCT1 in HeLa nuclei was more resistant to salt extraction , as compared to CYCT1 Δ HRD ( Fig . 2a ) , which suggests that the HRD promoted the retention of CYCT1 in the nucleus . To determine more precisely the location and dynamics of this retention , we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) analysis of bindings of Halo - tagged wild - type CYCT1 and CYCT1 Δ HRD to a gene array acti - vated by reverse tetracycline - controlled transactivator ( Fig . 2b ) . This array contains about 200 copies of an integrated transgene marked by YFP – Lac repressor bound to the lac operator , which enables FRAP to be performed at this spot 8 . We observed significantly faster FRAP recovery for CYCT1 Δ HRD on the array than for wild - type CYCT1 ( Fig . 2c ) . Further quantitative analysis ( Extended Data Fig . 3a , b and Supplementary Information ) revealed that this was mainly due to longer apparent residence time of wild - type CYCT1 ( τ off ~ 56 s ) , as compared to CYCT1 Δ HRD ( τ off ~ 4 s ) . 1 School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Xiamen University , Xiamen , China . 2 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology , University of California , Berkeley , CA , USA . * e - mail : qzhou @ berkeley . edu 3 1 8 | N At U r e | V O L 5 5 8 | 1 4 J U N e 2 0 1 8 © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

Letter reSeArCH To generalize the FRAP finding to endogenous genes ( active and inactive ) and cross - validate it using an orthogonal technique , we performed single - particle tracking in U2OS cells of Halo - tagged wild - type CYCT1 and CYCT1 Δ HRD proteins at 95 Hz to deter - mine whether the HRD affects CYCT1 diffusion dynamics and bound fractions 9 , 10 ( Fig . 2d , Extended Data Fig . 3c – e , Supplementary Video 1 and Supplementary Information ) . Consistent with the HRD - facilitated association of CYCT1 with chromatin and the transcriptional machinery , CYCT1 Δ HRD diffused faster and showed a smaller bound fraction ( 8 . 8 % ) than did wild - type CYCT1 ( 13 . 0 % ) . Next , we con - ducted single - particle tracking using a longer exposure time ( 500 ms ; Supplementary Video 2 ) to blur out fast - diffusing molecules and focus on bound molecules that were presumably located at predominantly activated genes . We observed a wide distribution of CYCT1 binding events that probably encompassed both specific and non - specific interactions ( Fig . 2e ) . Because this distribution did not fit well with models that assumed one or two single rate - limiting steps , we could not reliably attribute a single residence time . Nevertheless , consistent with the FRAP result , wild - type CYCT1 showed binding events that were significantly more stable than those of CYCT1 Δ HRD ( Fig . 2e ) . Together , the single - particle tracking and FRAP results underscore the key role of the HRD in promoting the binding of P - TEFb to activated genes to phosphorylate CTD 52 . What could be the direct target of the HRD on activated genes ? Consistent with a previous report that a CYCT1 mutant that lacked the HRD failed to bind the CTD 7 , wild - type GST – CYCT1 a CTD 52 + CTD 9 : ATP : 30 30 15 15 Reaction time ( min ) : 15 30 30 30 + + + – + – + – + – + – + – – – – – – – – – – + – – – + – – – – – + – – + + – – + – – + + – – – – – – + – – – – – – + – – – – – – + – – – – – – + – – – – – – + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + 30 15 30 30 30 15 30 30 15 30 CDK9 p - CTD 52 IIo p - CTD 9 CYCT1 – Flag : FL aa1 – 633 aa1 – 533 aa1 – 433 aa1 – 333 aa1 – 254 p - CDK9 * CYCT1 – Flag CDK9 – CYCT1 – Flag IIa b 58 11 1 79 28 12 7 Gal4 – C YC T1 ( 1 – 433 ) : Gal4 – C YC T1 ( 1 – 633 ) : 0 10 30 50 70 90 Gal4 – C YC T1 ( FL ; 1 – 726 ) : Fo l d o f ac t i v a t i o n Reporter : 6×UAS – LTR – luciferase Gal4 – C YC T1 ( 1 – 533 ) : Gal4 – C YC T1 ( 1 – 333 ) : Gal4 – C YC T1 ( 1 – 254 ) : TAR Luciferase 6×UAS 20 40 60 80 Gal4 – CYCT1 Tubulin ATP : 30 15 30 Reaction time ( min ) : 15 30 30 30 15 30 Δ CCD CYCT1 – Flag p - CTD 52 CycT1 – Flag : FL Δ HRD p - CTD 9 CDK9 p - CDK9 IIo IIa CTD 52 + CTD 9 : CDK9 – CYCT1 – Flag c CYCT1 cyclin - box TRM HRD PEST 250 – 272 480 – 550 706 – 726 13 – 250 379 – 430 CCD e d 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 1 . 0 75 . 5 Flag – Gal4 – CYCT1 : Flag – Gal4 – CYCT1 Δ CCD : Fo l d o f ac t i v a t i o n Reporter : 6×UAS – LTR – luciferase Flag Tubulin Flag – Gal4 – CYCT1 Δ HRD : 70 14 . 3 72 . 0 80 f TAR + 1 Short ( nt 10 – 59 ) Long ( nt 1 , 035 – 1 , 180 ) Long Short 60 50 40 10 0 1 . 01 . 00 . 9 1 . 0 58 . 9 28 . 9 HIV - 1 Fo l d o f ac t i v a t i o n Tat + CYCT1 Tat + CYCT1 Δ HRD Control CYCT1 Tubulin C Y C T 1 C Y C T 1 Δ H R D C o n t r o l 30 20 P = 0 . 0015 AFF4 BRD4 ELL2 HEXIM1 Nuclearextracts Anti - Flag IP CDK9 CYCT1 – Flag C YC T1 – Flag : C YC T1 Δ HRD – Flag : AFF1 LARP7 MEPCE + – + – + + + + + – + + + + + + + + Fig . 1 | The CYCT1 HRD promotes hyperphosphorylation of Pol II CTD 52 and activation of transcription , but not interaction with P - TEFb partners , by CDK9 . a , c , P - TEFb containing the indicated CYCT1 – Flag proteins ( domain structure at bottom ) were tested in kinase reactions containing GST – CTD 52 and GST – CTD 9 as the substrates .

Moreover , GST – CTD pulled down P - TEFb containing wild - type CYCT1 , but not CYCT1 Δ HRD ( Fig . 2g ) . Finally , a direct and HRD - dependent interaction was detected between a recombinant CYCT1 C - terminal fragment and mCherry – CTD in both the GST pulldown and glycerol gradient formats ( Extended Data Fig . 8a , b ) . Thus , P - TEFb uses the HRD to directly target the CTD . In addition to P - TEFb , CDK7 – CYCH in TFIIH is also a CTD kinase for Pol II to clear the promoter during transcription initiation 1 . Unlike CYCT1 , CYCH lacks a long C - terminal region and HRD . Compared to CDK9 – CYCT1 – Flag , affinity - purified CDK7 – CYCH – Flag pro - duced a markedly lower level of CTD 52 IIo in kinase reactions ( Fig . 3a ) , which was confirmed with recombinant CAK ( CDK7 – CYCH – MAT1 ) and P - TEFb ( Millipore ) in a time - and dosage - dependent manner ( Extended Data Fig . 4a , b ) . Appending a CYCT1 C - terminal fragment ( amino acids 401 – 630 ) containing the HRD to CYCH markedly increased hyperphosphoryl - ation by CDK7 of CTD 52 ( Fig . 3b ) , and partially rescued the CYCT1 knockdown to support HIV - 1 transcription ( Fig . 3c ) . However , when the HRD was deleted from the CYCH + CYCT1 chimaera , both the production of CTD 52 IIo and the rescue of CYCT1 knockdown were mostly abolished ( Fig . 3b , c ) , which indicates the importance of the HRD to these processes . Consistently , the chimaera , but not wild - type CYCH , was precipitated by GST – CTD ( Fig . 3d ) . We next investigated whether other CTD kinases also use an HRD to target Pol II for hyperphosphorylation . We noticed that the kinase DYRK1A , a CTD kinase that controls transcription of selected growth - related genes 6 and that is associated with Down syndrome , also contains an HRD ( Fig . 3e ) . The rest of DYRK1A and CYCT1 are non - homologous . In kinase reactions , wild - type DYRK1A and DYRK1A Δ HRD autophosphorylated to a similar extent , but only wild - type DYRK1A efficiently hyperphosphorylated CTD 52 ( Fig . 3e ) . In a co - immunoprecipitation assay employing three different anti - RPB1 antibodies , wild - type DYRK1A precipitated more Pol II than did DYRK1A Δ HRD ( Fig . 3f and Extended Data Fig . 4c ) . The precipi - tation of DCAF7 , which binds DYRK1A N terminus 11 , was unaffected by DYRK1A Δ HRD . Thus , in addition to CYCT1 , at least one other kinase also requires a functional HRD to efficiently bind and hyper - phosphorylate CTD 52 . The HRD is a low - complexity domain owing to the overrepresenta - tion of only a single amino acid . This domain , including a central cluster of multiple consecutive histidines , is highly conserved in verte - brate CYCT1 ( Extended Data Fig . 5a ) . Using the prediction program IUPred 12 ( http : / / iupred . enzim . hu ) , we found that the human CYCT1 HRD displays the highest disorder tendency in a broader intrinsi - cally disordered region ( IDR ) that lacks well - defined structure 13 and overlaps with the CYCT1 C - terminal region ( Extended Data Fig . 5b ) . Recently , the IDRs—especially those containing a low - complexity domain—have been shown to promote liquid – liquid phase separation , 1 . 0 0 . 9 0 . 8 0 . 7 0 . 6 20 40 80 100 120 140 160 180 60 0 200 B l eac h s p o t i n t e n s i t y ( A U ) Time after bleach ( s ) Halo – CYCT1 WT Halo – CYCT1 Δ HRD TRE Lac operator Tet CMV promoter ~ 200 copies on the gene array YFP Halo – TMR YFP – Lac repressor rtTA f CYCT1 – Flag : GST – CTD 52 : Flag CYCT1 Δ HRD – Flag : GST GST Input WB WB Flag G S T Pol II RPB1 CDK9 GST pull - down WB G S T – C Y C T 1 – F l a g G S T – C Y C T 1 Δ H R D – F l a g Flag g GST pull - down b Flag NaCl ( mM ) : WCE10 50 100 200WCE10 50 100 150 CDK7 CYCT1 – Flag CYCT1 Δ HRD – Flag 150 200 a c 0 500 1 , 000 1 , 500 00 . 10 . 20 . 30 . 40 . 50 . 60 . 70 . 80 . 91 . 0 ( 490 , 414 trajectories ) ( 459 , 525 trajectories ) Displacement r ( nm ) CDF of displacements ( Δ (cid:87) = 31 . 5 ms ) 0 5 10 15 To t a l b o un d f r ac t i o n ( % ) P = 0 . 0295 0 ms 10 . 5 ms 21 . 0 ms Halo – CYCT1 d W T C Y C T 1 C Y C T 1 Δ H R D Halo – CYCT1 WT Halo – CYCT1 Δ HRD WT : apparent (cid:87) off = ~ 56 s D i s p l ace m e n t C D F 10 – 3 10 – 2 10 – 1 10 0 1 3 10 30 100 300 Time ( s ) F r ac t i o n s t ill b o un d ( 1 – C D F ) e ( 90 , 762 trajectories ) Halo – CYCT1 WT ( 122 , 115 trajectories ) Halo – CYCT1 Δ HRD ( 122 , 834 trajectories ) Histone H2B – Halo 1 μ m CYCT1 Δ HRD : apparent (cid:87) off = ~ 4 s – + – + + – – – + + – + Fig . 2 | CYCT1 HRD contributes to the stable engagement of P - TEFb with activated gene array and endogenous genes , as well as direct binding to CTD by P - TEFb . a , Nuclei of HeLa cells expressing indicated CYCT1 – Flag were extracted with increasing NaCl concentrations .

Letter reSeArCH which probably drives the formation of intracellular membrane - less organelles 14 for compartmentalized biochemical reactions 13 . In vitro , phase separation is reversible 13 and influenced by several parameters ( for example , temperature , ionic strength , post - translational modifications and so on ) , which enable liquid droplets to form upon reaching a certain threshold and to quickly dissemble when pushed in the opposite direction 15 . To determine whether T1 - IDR ( amino acids 462 – 654 ) —the longest , HRD - containing CYCT1 IDR—could phase separate in an HRD - dependent manner , we purified the GFP – T1 - IDR and GFP – T1 - IDR Δ HRD fusions from Escherichia coli ( Extended Data Fig . 5c ) . At 150 mM NaCl , the protein solutions remained translucent . When lowered to 37 . 5 mM , a typical concentration used to induce phase separation in vitro 16 , 17 , the wild - type GFP – T1 - IDR solution immediately turned opaque , whereas GFP – T1 - IDR Δ HRD showed no change ( Extended Data Fig . 5e ) . Under a microscope , wild - type GFP – T1 - IDR spontaneously formed micrometre - sized , spherical droplets , whereas GFP – T1 - IDR Δ HRD produced only a low level of irregular aggregates ( Fig . 4a ) . Similarly , the GFP fusion that contained the longest IDR ( amino acids 491 – 686 ) of DYRK1A also formed droplets in an HRD - dependent manner ( Extended Data Fig . 6 ) . Notably , the GFP – T1 - IDR droplets quickly disappeared once NaCl returned to 150 mM ( Extended Data Fig . 5f ) . Furthermore , 1 , 6 - hexanediol , a compound that is known to perturb weak hydrophobic interactions to disassemble structures that exhibit liquid - like properties 18 , 19 , completely blocked droplet formation ( Extended Data Fig . 5g ) . Finally , when nine histidines within the his - tidine cluster in CYCT1 HRD were changed to alanines ( Extended Data Fig . 7a ) , the resulting GFP – T1 - IDR ( 9A ) mutant formed only tiny drop - lets ( Fig . 4b ) , which indicates that the histidines are essential for phase separation . Functionally , the mutation decreased phosphorylation by P - TEFb of CTD 52 , and the transcriptional activity of P - TEFb ( Extended Data Fig . 7c , d ) . In cells , both ectopically expressed CYCT1 – Flag or eGFP – CYCT1 and endogenous CYCT1 displayed a punctuated staining pattern inside the nuclei ( Fig . 4c – e and Extended Data Fig . 5h ) . This has previously been attributed to the localization of P - TEFb to the nuclear speckles enriched with transcription and splicing factors 20 , 21 . Importantly , HRD and its histidine cluster were needed to target CYCT1 to the speck - les ( Fig . 4c and Extended Data Figs . 5h , 7e ) , and the same has also been reported for DYRK1A 22 . Mirroring its disruption of the GFP – T1 - IDR droplets in vitro , 1 , 6 - hexanediol also quickly dissembled the CYCT1 nuclear speckles ( Fig . 4d ) . Finally , when performing time - lapse phase - contrast imaging of cells expressing eGFP – CYCT1 , we observed multiple cells in which CYCT1 speckles displayed at least one fusion event within the period of a few minutes , demonstrating their dynamic and liquid - like properties ( Fig . 4e ) . Following previous findings 23 , 24 , we asked whether the HRD - containing IDR could recruit the CTD into phase - separated droplets , given their demonstrated direct interaction . Indeed , although the CTD itself is a low - complexity sequence , recombinant mCherry – CTD 23 ( Extended Data Fig . 5d ) alone did not phase separate , but it was readily incorporated into droplets when incubated together with GFP – T1 - IDR ( Fig . 4f ) . During transcription , the CTD is phosphorylated first by CAK in TFIIH and then by P - TEFb 1 , 4 , 5 . Pre - phosphorylation by CAK ( Extended Data Fig . 8c ) not only enhanced the incorpo - ration of mCherry – CTD into the GFP – T1 - IDR droplets , but also promoted phase separation overall by producing bigger and brighter droplets ( Fig . 4f ) . Consistently , the pre - phosphorylated GST – CTD precipitated more GFP – T1 - IDR ( Extended Data Fig . 8d ) . Underscoring the physiological relevance of these observations , hyperphosphorylated Pol IIo is known to preferentially localize in the nuclear speckles 25 . Although both CTD hyperphosphorylation by CDK9 and HRD - mediated droplet formation were largely inhibited by 2 . 5 % 1 , 6 - hexan - ediol , the HRD – CTD binding ( and CDK9 – CYCT1 interaction ) was not substantially inhibited until 1 , 6 - hexanedil was at 10 % ( Fig . 4g – i ) . This important difference suggests that phase separation , which is caused by weak , multivalent interactions among the HRDs and is easily disrupted by 1 , 6 - hexanediol , is critical for the hyperphosphorylation of the CTD .

Letter reSeArCH On the other hand , the relatively drug - resistant HRD – CTD binding is probably key to the recruitment of the CTD to CDK9 in droplets , but is insufficient to establish the optimal environment for hyperphospho - rylation ( Extended Data Fig . 9 ) . In summary , our data indicate that in at least two kinases—CYCT1 of P - TEFb and DYRK1A—the HRD , a low - complexity domain of previously unknown function , promotes the hyperphosphorylation of the CTD by targeting the CTD as well as inducing phase separa - tion in vitro and in cells . The phase - separated droplets and speckles compartmentalize the kinase and substrate to enable highly efficient reactions , which results in the hyperphosphorylation of the CTD and robust transcriptional elongation and RNA processing . FUS and TAF15 , which are two proteins that contain low - complexity domain and that are active in transcription initiation , have previously been shown to form phase - separated hydrogels that trap the CTD 23 , 24 . Additionally , the bidirectionally transcribed enhancers and resulting antisense transcripts have been proposed to control initiation in part through phase separation 26 . What was unknown until now is whether any transcription factors and the CTD are involved in droplet forma - tion after initiation 1 . Our finding that phase separation is induced by CYCT1 of P - TEFb ( a well - defined transcription elongation factor ) and DYRK1A ( a probable gene - specific elongation factor 6 ) has expanded the regulatory roles of phase separation to the next stage of the tran - scription cycle . Furthermore , these studies show that some key ini - tiation and elongation factors that phase separate should no longer be viewed as passive passengers waiting to be picked up by the CTD . Rather , they have active roles in recruiting Pol II through multivalent interactions to their droplets and / or speckles that function as hubs where much of transcription and RNA processing is dynamically controlled .

The anti - Flag affinity - purification was performed under high salt plus detergent ( 1 M KCl + 1 % NP - 40 ) conditions to strip away all the P - TEFb - associated factors but keep the CDK9 – CYCT1 interaction intact . b , Affinity - purified CDK9 – CYCT1 – Flag heterodimers containing the indicated CYCT1 – Flag proteins were tested in kinase reactions containing a mixture of GST - fused CTD 52 and CTD 9 as the substrates . The phosphorylated p - CTD 52 and p - CTD 9 were detected by western blotting with the anti - phospho - Ser2 antibody 3E10 . Although a very similar pattern of CTD phosphorylation was detected with both anti - phospho - Ser2 and anti - phospho - Ser5 antibodies , the unphosphorylated CTD present in the ATP ( – ) lanes was only detected by the former antibody , making the phospho - Ser5 antibody a preferred choice for detecting CTD phosphorylation in these kinase reactions . © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

At 2 . 5 % 1 , 6 - hexanediol , the HRD - mediated phase separation but not the direct HRD – CTD binding is disrupted , making it impossible for P - TEFb to hyperphosphorylate the CTD . © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

This form provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting . For further information on Nature Research policies , see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist . Statistical parameters When statistical analyses are reported , confirm that the following items are present in the relevant location ( e . g . figure legend , table legend , main text , or Methods section ) . n / a Confirmed The exact sample size ( n ) for each experimental group / condition , given as a discrete number and unit of measurement An indication of whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly The statistical test ( s ) used AND whether they are one - or two - sided Only common tests should be described solely by name ; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section . A description of all covariates tested A description of any assumptions or corrections , such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons A full description of the statistics including central tendency ( e . g . means ) or other basic estimates ( e . g . regression coefficient ) AND variation ( e . g . standard deviation ) or associated estimates of uncertainty ( e . g . confidence intervals ) For null hypothesis testing , the test statistic ( e . g . F , t , r ) with confidence intervals , effect sizes , degrees of freedom and P value noted Give P values as exact values whenever suitable . For Bayesian analysis , information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings For hierarchical and complex designs , identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes Estimates of effect sizes ( e . g . Cohen ' s d , Pearson ' s r ) , indicating how they were calculated Clearly defined error bars State explicitly what error bars represent ( e . g . SD , SE , CI ) Our web collection on statistics for biologists may be useful .
