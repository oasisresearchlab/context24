Durieux Abstract Dynamin 2 ( DNM2 ) mutations cause autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy ( CNM ) , a rare form of congenital myopathy , and intermediate and axonal forms of Charcot - Marie - Tooth disease ( CMT ) , a peripheral neuropathy . DNM2 is a large GTPase mainly involved in membrane trafficking through its function in the formation and release of nascent vesicles from biological membranes . DNM2 participates in clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent endocytosis and intracellular membrane trafficking ( from endosomes and Golgi apparatus ) . Recent studies have also implicated DNM2 in exocytosis . DNM2 belongs to the machinery responsible for the formation of vesicles and regulates the cytoskeleton providing intracellular vesicle transport . In addition , DNM2 tightly interacts with , and is involved in the regulation of actin and microtubule networks , independent from membrane trafficking processes . We summarize here the molecular , biochemical and functional data on DNM2 and discuss the possible pathophysiological mechanisms via which DNM2 mutations can lead to two distinct neuromuscular disorders . Key Words : dynamin 2 , centronuclear myopathy , Charcot - Marie - Tooth neuropathy , endocytosis , cytoskeleton . 3 . Durieux Dynamin 2 ( DNM2 ) belongs to a superfamily of large GTPases , including three classical dynamins and several dynamin - like proteins , which are involved in a wide range of cell functions [ 1 ] . The importance of DNM2 was emphasized in 2005 with the demonstration of DNM2 gene mutations causing two distinct human diseases [ 2 , 3 ] . Our purpose is to review the molecular and functional data on DNM2 to highlight the possible pathophysiological hypotheses in DNM2 - related diseases . Knowledge of the dynamins , especially of their molecular and biochemical properties , mainly comes from numerous studies of dynamin 1 ( DNM1 ) [ 4 ] . However , we have focused this review on DNM2 since several studies have clearly demonstrated notable differences between DNM1 and DNM2 [ 5 - 9 ] . Moreover , DNM1 and DNM2 seem to be involved in different membrane trafficking processes in cells expressing the two proteins [ 10 , 11 ] . DNM2 gene organization and isoforms DNM2 , one of three classical dynamins , was initially identified in rat liver and brain cDNA libraries [ 5 , 12 ] . A human homologue was thereafter identified by screening of a fibroblast library [ 13 ] . The human transcript ( 3 . 6 kilobases ) is ubiquitously expressed , with higher abundance in heart and skeletal muscle [ 13 ] . Human DNM2 is encoded by the DNM2 gene located on the short arm of chromosome 19 ( 19p13 . 2 ) . The gene is composed of 22 exons in a 114 - kilobase region . Four isoforms are expressed by the DNM2 gene using a combination of two alternative splice sites ( Figure 1A ) . Isoforms 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 are also known as isoforms aa , ba , ab and bb , respectively [ 14 ] . Exons 10 and 10bis have the same length ( 139 base pairs encoding the amino - acids 399 - 445 in the middle domain ) and are alternatively spliced . In addition , the exon 13bis ( 12 - base pair length ) can be spliced leading to the translation of proteins of 866 or 870 amino - acids ( Figure 1 ) without or with the GEIL 4 . Durieux sequence at position 516 - 519 in the C - terminal part of the middle domain . The expression of the four isoforms have been assessed in a panel of rat tissues including brain , heart , kidney , liver , lung , pancreas and testis [ 14 ] . The human tissue expression pattern is unknown , but we have shown expression of the four isoforms in skeletal muscle and peripheral nerve [ 15 ] . Specific functions of these isoforms will be discussed below . DNM2 structure and regulation The 98 kDa DNM2 is a large GTPase composed of a N - terminal GTPase domain , a middle domain , a pleckstrin homology domain ( PH ) , a GTPase effector domain ( GED ) and a C - terminal proline rich domain ( PRD ) ( Figure 1B ) . The catalytic GTPase domain is responsible for GTP binding and hydrolysis , whereas the middle domain is involved in DNM2 self - assembly [ 16 ] and in GTP hydrolysis - induced conformational change of the protein [ 17 ] . The PH domain interacts with membrane phosphoinositides and therefore involved in the targeting of dynamin to plasma or Golgi membranes [ 18 ] . Klein and collaborators reported that the DNM2 - PH domain displays phosphoinositide binding affinity following the order ; PI4 , 5P2 ≈ PI3 , 4 , 5P3 ≈ PI3 , 4P2 > PI4P ≈ PI3P , and DNM2 oligomerization appears crucial for high affinity [ 19 ] . The GED probably participates in the self - assembly of DNM2 and acts as a GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) [ 20 ] . The PRD contains multiple Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) binding motifs and mediates multiple protein - protein interactions ( Table 1 ) . In vitro at high ionic strength , DNM2 is in monomer - tetramer equilibrium . At low ionic strength , DNM2 self - assembles into higher order aggregates leading to a drastic increase in GTPase activity [ 21 , 22 ] . Microtubules or phospholipid vesicles , especially those containing PI4 , 5P2 , also induce self - assembly and increase DNM2 GTPase activity [ 6 , 21 , 5 . Durieux 23 ] . Purified from baculovirus , GTP - bound and GDP - bound monomer DNM2 has Kd values of 13 . 2 and 7 . 1 µM , respectively , with GTPase activity of 37 nmol / mg / min . When in an oligomeric state , the GTPase activity of DNM2 markedly increased and Kd values decreased [ 24 ] . DNM2 basal activity appears 10 - fold higher than for DNM1 probably due to the greater propensity of DNM2 to self - assemble and a higher affinity for GTP ( Km = 12 µM ) [ 21 ] . When compared to small GTPases , DNM2 exhibits a relatively low affinity for GTP but high intrinsic rates of GTP hydrolysis . DNM2 activity is regulated by post - translational modifications . DNM2 becomes phosphorylated on Tyr231 ( middle domain ) and Tyr597 ( PH domain ) through Src - mediated phosphorylation , leading to its association with caveolin and thus albumin endocytosis [ 25 ] . Similarly , IL5 - induced DNM2 phosphorylation leads to redistribution of DNM2 within endocytic vesicles and is required for IL5 receptor internalization [ 26 ] . In contrast , dopamine leads to the dephosphorylation of DNM2 by increasing protein phosphatase 2A activity , necessary for dopamine - induced Na + K + - ATPase endocytosis [ 27 ] . S - nitrosylation of Cys86 ( GTPase domain ) and Cys607 ( PH domain ) by nitric oxide ( NO ) increases DNM2 GTPase activity and endocytosis [ 28 ] . Finally , regulation of DNM2 by proteolysis under pathological condition has also been reported [ 29 ] . Sever et al . identified a cathepsin L cleavage site at positions 355 - 360 in the middle domain ( Figure 1B ) . In a mouse model of kidney disease , cathepsin L induction leads to the cleavage of the cytoplasmic DNM2 and then actin reorganization in renal podocytes , filtration impairment and proteinuria [ 29 ] . It remains to be determined whether such proteolytic regulation occurs in other tissues . Phosphorylation of DNM1 by protein kinase C ( PKC ) increases Ca 2 + binding to the protein , which in turn inhibits DNM1 stimulated GTPase activity [ 30 ] . Although DNM2 is not a substrate of PKC and does not bind Ca 2 + [ 5 ] it was demonstrated that Ca 2 + also inhibits 6 . Durieux DNM2 GTPase activity ( IC 50 = 150µM ) and receptor mediated endocytosis in Hela cells [ 31 ] . This may have physiological importance in excitable cells like neurons and muscle fibers . It is still largely unknown how the expression of DMN2 is regulated . In rat , DNM2 is up - regulated during normal pancreatic development after birth [ 32 ] but not in the liver [ 12 ] or the brain [ 33 ] . In mouse , treatment with opioid agonist results in increased DNM2 protein content in the spinal cord [ 34 , 35 ] whereas opioid antagonist decreases DNM2 abundance [ 35 , 36 ] . These changes in the level of DNM2 expression are inversely correlated with opioid receptor density at the plasma membrane , suggestive of feed - back regulation . A similar type of regulation has also been described in brain [ 37 ] . DNM2 function 1 . Endocytosis . DNM2 has been implicated in the formation of clathrin - coated pits [ 21 ] . In the cytosol , DNM2 forms a complex with sorting nexin 9 ( SNX9 ) and fructose - 1 , 6 - bisphosphate aldolase [ 38 , 39 ] . Phosphorylation of SNX9 releases aldolase from the SNX9 - DNM2 complex which is now competent for membrane targeting [ 39 , 40 ] . DNM2 anchorage to the membrane occurs via interaction with PI4 , 5P2 membrane phosphoinositide [ 41 ] and BAR ( Bin1 / Amphiphysin / RVS167 ) domain proteins ; amphiphysin 1 , amphiphysin 2 , and SNX9 ( Table 1 ) in curved sites of the membranes . Subsequently , DNM2 co - localizes with clathrin before and during the internalization of the coated vesicle [ 7 ] . This suggests that DNM2 may play a role not only in the release , but also in the first steps of vesicle formation , as recently shown in the turnover of intermediates during the maturation of clathrin - coated pits [ 42 ] . During this process , DNM2 forms an oligomer helical structure around the neck of the nascent vesicles [ 21 ] and GTP hydrolysis is associated with the release of the vesicles . 7 . Durieux DNM2 is also involved in clathrin - independent endocytosis by its role in the formation of the phagosomes in macrophages and Sertoli cells [ 43 , 44 ] and caveolae in hepatocytes and endothelial cells [ 45 , 46 ] . Predescu et al . described a protein complex , including DNM2 , intersectin and SNAP - 23 , that was important for the fission and internalization of caveolae [ 47 ] . In caveolae , DNM2 also interacts with endothelial nitric - oxide synthase ( eNOS ) in bovine aortic endothelial cells [ 48 ] where DNM2 may regulate eNOS activation and the NO signalling cascade [ 48 - 51 ] . DNM2 also participates in coat - independent endocytosis processes , i . e . micropinocytosis and macropinocytosis , by which fluid droplets and specific membrane components are internalized [ 52 , 53 ] . Altogether , these data demonstrate a role for DNM2 in clathrin - and caveolae - dependent endocytosis as well as coat - independent endocytosis , and in regulating several important cellular processes including signal transduction , cholesterol homeostasis , plasma membrane composition and turnover , cell migration and entry of pathogens . 2 . Intracellular membrane trafficking . DNM2 targets to the Golgi apparatus where it is predominantly localized in the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) [ 54 ] . Anti - DNM2 antibody injection and over - expression of DNM2 mutants impair vesicle formation from the TGN [ 55 - 57 ] . Association of DNM2 with cortactin , by an arf - 1 and actin - dependent mechanism , and with syndapin 2 , is required for trafficking of nascent vesicles from the TGN [ 58 , 59 ] . DNM2 is also found at the clathrin - coated buds of early endosomes [ 60 ] and in late endosomes in Hela cells , located to the tubulo - vesicular appendices [ 61 ] . In these two cases , interfering DNM2 mutant impairs the recycling of components from the endosomal system towards the plasma membrane or TGN [ 60 , 61 ] . These data highlight the role of DNM2 in the secretory pathway and in the sorting of cell components from the Golgi apparatus and endosomal compartment . 8 . Durieux 3 . Exocytosis . In neuroendocrine cells , monomers of DNM2 are associated with the membrane of secretory chromaffin granules in a complex including syntaxin , a member of the exocytosis machinery [ 62 ] . DNM2 also interacts and co - localizes with complexin I , a SNARE regulatory protein [ 63 ] . Therefore , DNM2 may participate in endocytosis - exocytosis coupling as suggested in mouse pancreatic β - cells [ 64 ] . However , a role for DNM2 in exocytosis alone has been reported . During cell - mediated killing by natural killer ( NK ) cells , DNM2 co - localizes with lytic granules after NK cell activation , and is required for fusion of the granules with the plasma membrane [ 65 ] . Similarly in macrophages , focal exocytosis is blocked after anti - DNM2 antibody microinjection [ 66 ] and DNM2 GTPase activity regulates the fusion of secretory vesicles at the plasma membrane [ 67 ] . Further studies will be necessary to precisely identify the molecular role played by DNM2 in the exocytosis machinery . 4 . Actin network . Actin - based dynamic processes are crucial for late stage endocytosis and vesicle formation , and DNM2 interacts with several actin - binding proteins . Direct interactions have been identified with Abp1 ( actin - binding protein 1 ) [ 68 ] and cortactin [ 69 , 70 ] . Abp1 is a Src kinase which provides a physical bridge between the endocytosis machinery and the cortical actin network , and cortactin is a component of the clathrin - mediated endocytosis machinery [ 71 ] . In addition , DNM2 is a component of actin - based motile vesicles ( actin comets ) [ 72 , 73 ] which provide transport through the cytoplasm for vesicles formed by the Golgi apparatus or plasma membrane . Expression of DNM2 - K44A mutant , defective for the GTPase activity , strongly reduces the number , length and velocity of the comets [ 72 , 73 ] . Interaction between DNM2 and the actin cytoskeleton may have another cytoskeletal role such as in the formation of membrane tubules and protrusions . Furthermore , a recent study showed the crucial function played by the DNM2 - cortactin complex in the global 9 . Durieux organisation and remodelling of the actomyosin cytoskeleton [ 74 ] . In addition , DNM2 is present in cortical ruffles and lamellipodia , both important in cell migration [ 14 , 69 ] . The supramolecular complex including DNM2 , cortactin and Arp2 / 3 mediates the reorganization of actin allowing lamellipodia formation at the leading edge of migrating cells [ 75 ] . Disruption of DNM2 function by DNM2 - K44A mutant or small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , inhibits the formation of lamellipodia [ 76 ] . Similarly , under PDGF stimulation , DNM2 is concentrated within the leading ruffles of migrating fibroblasts where it co - localizes with cortactin [ 69 ] . To allow cell migration , DNM2 participates in disassembly of focal adhesions , as well as β - integrin internalization at the rear of the cell [ 77 , 78 ] . Additionally , DNM2 is enriched in specialized membrane protrusions such as podosomes and invadipodia . Podosomes represent attachment sites between cells and substratum [ 79 ] and invadipodia are focalized matrix degradation sites [ 80 ] . Inhibition of DNM2 diminishes the amount of such structures [ 80 ] . It has also been shown that DNM2 regulates the formation of actin stress - fibers by interaction with the cell surface heparin sulphate proteoglygan syndecan - 4 [ 81 ] Expression of DNM2 - mutant , truncated for the PRD domain mediating interaction with cortactin , increases the number of actin - stress fibers , which is associated with abnormal cell shape [ 69 ] . 5 . Microtubule network and MTOC . It is noteworthy that the first isolated dynamin , i . e . DNM1 , was initially reported as a microtubule associated protein [ 4 ] . A similar binding property has been evidenced for DNM2 in vitro [ 21 ] and the binding region was located to the PRD [ 6 , 82 ] . More recently , it was shown that down - regulation of DNM2 by siRNA increases the amount of acetylated tubulin , a more stable form of tubulin in microtubules , and reduces their growing capacity [ 83 ] , suggesting that DNM2 may regulate the polymerization - depolymerization equilibrium of microtubules . Through its interaction with microtubules , 10 . Durieux DNM2 appears involved in Golgi apparatus cohesion [ 83 ] . Moreover , DNM2 has been identified as a component of the centrosome , the main microtubule organizing center ( MTOC ) , where it binds to γ - tubulin [ 84 ] . The centrosome consists of a pair of centrioles embedded in a filamentous pericentriolar matrix , where γ - tubulin is essential for microtubule nucleation . The function played by DNM2 at the centrosome is still unknown , but DNM2 silencing by siRNA suggests a role in centrosome splitting [ 84 ] . Likewise , participation of DNM2 in all the phases of mitosis has also been reported . DNM2 is detected in the 2 MTOC during early prophase , along the mitotic spindle during metaphase and in the spindle midzone region during anaphase and early telophase [ 85 ] . Thereafter , DNM2 is accumulated at the intracellular bridge where the final separation occurs . The time required for separation of the two daughter cells is longer in DNM2 knock - out cells [ 53 ] . Taken together , these data suggest that DNM2 may regulate microtubule - dependent processes by acting on microtubule dynamics and organisation . 6 . Apoptosis . In order to establish a stable Hela cell line over - expressing DNM2 isoform 2 , Fish et al . have reported a significant cell toxicity in dividing cells [ 86 ] . The cytotoxicity occurred via induction of apoptosis by a p53 - dependent mechanism . Similar results were gained in vascular smooth muscle cells [ 87 ] . The capacity to trigger apoptosis appears DNM2 - specific as DNM1 over - expression does not induce apoptosis [ 86 ] . The GTPase domain of DNM2 is crucial to induce apoptosis [ 88 ] . Besides , a point mutation ( p . I684K ) in the DNM2 GED enhances the apoptosis induction by the wild - type DNM2 suggesting that GED negatively regulates this DNM2 function [ 88 ] . Mitochondria are key actors in apoptosis and , interestingly , DNM2 has been detected in isolated mitochondria from bovine lymphoblastoid BL - 3 cells [ 89 ] . However , to our knowledge , such localization has not been reported in other cell lines or tissues . DNM2 also regulates the apoptosis - inducing Fas - Fas 11 . Durieux ligand pathway by facilitating the transport of Fas from the trans - Golgi network to the plasma membrane [ 90 ] . 7 . Specific functions of DNM2 isoforms . In a cultured rat epithelial cell line ( clone 9 ) , both DNM2 isoforms 1 and 3 show punctuate labeling of clathrin heavy chain - positive or - negative structures , but only isoform 1 , with the GEIL sequence in the middle domain , appears located to the Golgi apparatus [ 14 ] . These data suggest a role for the GEIL sequence in targeting to the Golgi apparatus . However , cell - type specificity probably exists , as isoforms without the GEIL sequence were also shown to be targeted to the Golgi apparatus in MDCK cells [ 56 ] , 3T3L1 adipocytes [ 91 ] and fibroblastoid - like cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells [ 53 ] . Nevertheless , this possible differential localization argues for distinct functions . Indeed , in clone 9 cells , the K44A mutants of isoforms 2 and 4 are able to inhibit fluid - phase endocytosis , whereas the mutant forms of isoforms 1 and 3 do not [ 52 ] , and are more potent inhibitors of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Similarly in a hepatocyte cell line , the K44A - isoform 1 inhibits caveolae - dependent internalization , but not the other K44A mutant isoforms [ 92 ] . In fibroblastoid - like cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells , isoforms 2 and 4 are the most efficient at rescuing export from the Golgi in DNM2 knock - out cells [ 53 ] . Altogether , these data suggest a preferential involvement of isoforms 1 and 3 in clathrin - and caveolae - dependent endocytosis , whereas isoforms 2 and 4 participate in uncoated endocytosis and trafficking from the Golgi apparatus . However , cell - type specificity also occurs as the four isoforms exhibit a similar subcellular distribution in 3T3L1 adipocytes and dominant negative mutants of each isoform similarly affect basal and insulin - stimulated GLUT4 trafficking [ 91 ] . DNM2 and human disease 12 . Durieux Mutations in the DNM2 gene cause rare forms of the Charcot - Marie - Tooth peripheral neuropathy ( CMT ) [ 2 , 93 - 96 ] and autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy ( CNM ) [ 3 , 15 , 97 - 99 ] . The 19 reported heterozygous mutations affect only the Middle domain , the PH domain and the GED ( figure 1B ) . DNM2 - related CNM is a slowly progressive congenital myopathy characterized by frequent centrally located nuclei in muscle fibers . The most common clinical features are delayed motor milestones , facial and generalized muscle weakness , ptosis and ophthalmoplegia [ 100 ] . Nevertheless , the severity of DNM2 - CNM is variable , ranging from severe neonatal to mild late - onset forms . DNM2 - CMT is a peripheral neuropathy characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy . DNM2 mutations can cause axonal CMT ( CMT2 ) and dominant intermediate CMT ( DI - CMT - B ) . In CMT2 , the nerve conduction velocity is usually normal ( > 38 m / s for the median nerve , which represents the cut - off value between the demyelinating CMT1 and the axonal CMT2 ) . In the group of rare patients affected by DI - CMT - B , the nerve conduction velocity values are intermediate ( between 25 and 45 m / s ) . In some CMT patients , neuropathy is associated with neutropenia [ 2 , 94 , 96 ] but this association has not been described in DNM2 - CNM patients . Clinical overlap could exist in some patients , but the majority of patients are affected by a tissue - specific disorder targeting either skeletal muscle or peripheral nerve [ 94 , 99 , 100 ] . Among the 19 distinct DNM2 mutations identified to date , there are no mutations common to the two disorders and no mutations in the regions of variation due to alternative splicing . No clear genotype - phenotype relationship can be generated , except for the de novo mutations located in the C - terminal part of the PH domain , which are all associated with a severe neonatal CNM phenotype [ 98 ] . In these patients , the phenotype progressively improves , suggesting compensatory mechanisms . Of note is that the CMT - mutation G358R , is located in the 13 . Durieux cathepsin L cleavage site [ 29 ] and therefore may impair the regulation of DNM2 by proteolysis . More recently , the DNM2 gene has been described as a susceptibility gene for late - onset Alzheimer disease [ 101 ] , and DNM2 expression was subsequently found to be decreased in the brains of late - onset Alzheimer patients [ 102 ] . Cognitive impairments have been reported in some CNM patients harboring the p . E368Q [ 97 ] , p . R465W [ 103 ; Family 1 ] and p . R369Q [ 103 ; Families 2 and 3 ] DNM2 mutations . Future studies will be necessary to determine the prevalence of central nervous system involvement in DNM2 - related diseases . Pathophysiological hypotheses 1 . Membrane trafficking and signaling pathway hypothesis . In addition to the DNM2 mutations in autosomal dominant CNM , mutations in the BIN1 gene encoding amphiphysin 2 , a partner of DNM2 in the endocytic process , can cause the autosomal recessive form of the disease [ 104 ] . This suggests that endocytic impairment is implicated in the pathophysiological mechanisms of autosomal CNM . Indeed , impairment of clathrin - mediated endocytosis was also reported in cultured cells expressing CNM - or CMT - DNM2 mutants [ 2 , 15 , 83 ] . The crucial question which remains to be explored is how a defect in clathrin - mediated endocytosis can alter the cell function . Endocytosis ( via clathrin - coated vesicles , caveolae or uncoated vesicles ) regulates fundamental processes including nutrient uptake , membrane composition and turnover , cell adhesion or migration , pathogen entry , and signaling of G protein - coupled receptors , tyrosine kinase receptors or channels [ 105 - 107 ] . Thus , DNM2 mutations may have a large spectrum of functional consequences . On one hand , DNM2 mutations may lead to a decrease in receptor stimulated signaling as shown for the MAPK ERK1 / 2 pathway [ 15 , 108 ] . On the other hand , DNM2 mutations may lead to a prolonged 14 . Durieux half - life of various proteins at the cell surface due to a defect in protein removal , similar to that as suggested for the EnaC sodium channel [ 109 , 110 ] , KCNQ1 potassium channel subunits [ 111 ] or the GLUT4 glucose transporter [ 91 , 112 - 114 ] . A deregulation of glucose transport in patients with DNM2 mutations could have a strong impact on muscle fibers given their high glucose consumption . Of note , the microtubule network plays an important role in GLUT4 trafficking [ 115 ] and a decrease in muscle weight has been reported for a transgenic mouse over - expressing GLUT4 [ 116 ] . To date , the impact of disease - associated DNM2 mutants on other membrane trafficking processes in which DNM2 is involved , especially in endosomal and Golgi pathways , has not been studied . In cells over - expressing the K44A - DNM2 mutant , an impairment in the trafficking from the Golgi apparatus has been reported [ 117 , 118 ] . We cannot exclude a participation of these pathways in the pathomechanisms of DNM2 - related disorders . 2 . Cytoskeleton . In DNM2 - CNM , the majority of patients harbour a mutation in the middle domain , which is essential for the centrosomal localization of DNM2 and for its interaction with γ - tubulin [ 84 ] . Previous results in skin fibroblasts indicate that transfected GFP - DNM2 - mutants failed to be correctly targeted to the centrosome , suggesting that DNM2 mutations might cause CNM by interfering with centrosome function [ 3 ] . In addition , CMT - related DNM2 mutants can disorganize the microtubule cytoskeleton [ 2 ] and one particular CMT - mutant was shown to impair microtubule - dependent membrane transport [ 83 ] . During skeletal muscle differentiation a profound reorganization of the microtubule network occurs , changing from a classical network centered on the juxtanuclear centrosome in myoblasts , to a longitudinal organization along the axis of differentiated myotubes [ 119 ] . One can hypothesize that mutated - DNM2 can impair functions associated with this specific 15 . Durieux cytoskeleton reorganization . In addition to their roles in intracellular trafficking , the microtubule and actin networks regulate cellular architecture including nuclear positioning [ 120 , 121 ] . Thus , cytoskeletal impairment may be implicated in the abnormal central location of the nuclei in the muscle fibers in CNM . In CMT , DNM2 mutations could also induce a destabilization of the microtubule network leading to abnormal axonal transport and protein trafficking , a pathophysiological mechanism described previously in various forms of CMT [ 122 ] . Concluding remarks and open questions Given the numerous distinct functions in which the ubiquitously expressed DNM2 is involved , the identification of pathophysiological mechanisms will be a challenge . The phenotypes encountered in CNM and CMT patients are probably due to impairment of the various functions of the protein . DNM2 is engaged in numerous protein - protein interactions ( Table 1 ) but the relevance of these interactions in skeletal muscle and the nervous system , is largely unexplored . For example , DNM2 interacts with β - catenin in rat testis in relation to the maintenance of the blood - testis barrier integrity [ 123 ] but no data are available on this interaction in skeletal muscle where β - catenin plays an important role [ 124 , 125 ] . Another essential unresolved question is whether each particular mutation can similarly affect the functions of the four DNM2 isoforms . Finally , whereas some data emerge on the impact of disease - related DNM2 mutations on the microtubule network , their impact on the actin cytoskeleton is totally unknown . Future developments and characterization of animal models will certainly be useful to better determine the main functions of DNM2 in vivo , especially in skeletal muscle and peripheral nerves where membrane trafficking displays different characteristics depending to the length of the cells . 16 .
