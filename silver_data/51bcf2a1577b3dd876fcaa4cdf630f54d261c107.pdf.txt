because the efficiency of transcription initiation correlates with the binding affinity of T7 RNAp ( 25 ) . We therefore inserted DNA templates used in vitro ( fig . S15 ) into the chromosome of Escherichia coli and measured the expression level of lacZ using the Miller assay ( Fig . 4A ) ( 26 ) . Indeed , the gene expression level oscillates as a function of L with a periodicity of ~ 10 bp ( Fig . 4B ) . Similar oscillations of T7 RNAp ac - tivity were observed on plasmids in E . coli cells by using a yellow fluorescent protein as a re - porter ( fig . S16 ) . The oscillation of gene ex - pression levels with a 10 - bp periodicity was also seen in a classic experiment on lac operon with a DNA loop formed by two operators ( 27 ) . How - ever , our T7 RNAp result illustrates that DNA allostery results in such an oscillatory phenomenon even without a DNA loop , which is consistent with a recent study in which E . coli RNA poly - merase was used ( 10 ) . Pertinent to eukaryotic gene expression , DNA allostery may affect the binding affinity of tran - scription factors near nucleosomes that are closely positioned ( 28 , 29 ) . We placed GRE downstream of a nucleosome ( Fig . 4C ) and observed a sim - ilar DNA allosteric effect in the k off of GRDBD ( Fig . 4D and fig . S17 ) . To evaluate DNA allos - tery in an internucleosomal space , we used two nucleosomes to flank a GRE ( Fig . 4C ) . At the same separation L , GRDBD resides on GRE for a relatively longer time with a single nucleosome nearby than it does with a pair of nucleosomes on both sides of GRE ( Fig . 4D ) . Nonetheless , the fold change between the maximal and minimal k off is larger for GRDBD with two nucleosomes ( approximately sevenfold ) . This indicates mod - erately large cooperativity between the two flanking nucleosomes in modifying the binding affinity of GRDBD , which is in line with pre - vious in vivo experiments ( 30 , 31 ) . The fact that histones modify a neighboring transcription fac - tor ’ s binding suggests that allostery through DNA might be physiologically important in affecting gene regulation .

The type II prokaryotic CRISPR ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ) / Cas adaptive immune system has been shown to facilitate RNA - guided site - specific DNA cleavage . We engineered two different type II CRISPR / Cas systems and demonstrate that Cas9 nucleases can be directed by short RNAs to induce precise cleavage at endogenous genomic loci in human and mouse cells . Cas9 can also be converted into a nicking enzyme to facilitate homology - directed repair with minimal mutagenic activity . Lastly , multiple guide sequences can be encoded into a single CRISPR array to enable simultaneous editing of several sites within the mammalian genome , demonstrating easy programmability and wide applicability of the RNA - guided nuclease technology . P recise and efficient genome - targeting tech - nologies are needed to enable systematic reverse engineering of causal genetic varia - tions by allowing selective perturbation of indi - vidual genetic elements . Although genome - editing technologies such as designer zinc fingers ( ZFs ) ( 1 – 4 ) , transcription activator – like effectors ( TALEs ) ( 4 – 10 ) , and homing meganucleases ( 11 ) have be - gun to enable targeted genome modifications , there remains a need for new technologies that are scal - able , affordable , and easy to engineer . Here , we report the development of a class of precision genome - engineering tools based on the RNA - guided Cas9 nuclease ( 12 – 14 ) from the type II prokaryoticclus - tered regularly interspaced short palindromic re - peats ( CRISPR ) adaptive immune system ( 15 – 18 ) . The Streptococcus pyogenes SF370 type II CRISPR locus consists of four genes , includ - ing the Cas9 nuclease , as well as two noncoding CRISPR RNAs ( crRNAs ) : trans - activating crRNA ( tracrRNA ) and a precursor crRNA ( pre - crRNA ) array containing nuclease guide sequences ( spacers ) interspaced by identical direct repeats ( DRs ) ( fig . S1 ) ( 19 ) . We sought to harness this prokaryotic 1 Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard , 7 Cambridge Center , Cambridge , MA 02142 , USA , and McGovern Institute for Brain Research , Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences , De - partment of Biological Engineering , Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , Cambridge , MA 02139 , USA . 2 Program in Biological and Biomedical Sciences , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA 02115 , USA . 3 Harvard - MIT Health Sciences and Technology , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA 02115 , USA . 4 Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology , Harvard Uni - versity , Cambridge , MA 02138 , USA . 5 School of Life Sciences , Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084 , China . 6 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics , College of Physicians andSurgeons , ColumbiaUniversity , NewYork , NY10032 , USA . 7 Computational and Systems Biology Graduate Program and Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , MA 02139 , USA . 8 Labo - ratory of Bacteriology , The Rockefeller University , 1230 York Avenue , New York , NY 10065 , USA . * These authors contributed equally to this work . † To whom correspondence should be addressed .

It has been previously shown that expression of tracrRNA , pre - crRNA , host factor ribonuclease ( RNase ) III , and Cas9 nuclease is necessary and sufficient for cleavage of DNA in vitro ( 12 , 13 ) and in pro - karyotic cells ( 20 , 21 ) . We codon - optimized the S . pyogenesCas9 ( SpCas9 ) and RNaseIII ( SpRNase III ) genes and attached nuclear localization sig - nals ( NLSs ) to ensure nuclear compartmental - ization in mammalian cells . Expression of these constructs in human 293FT cells revealed that two NLSs are most efficient at targeting SpCas9 to the nucleus ( Fig . 1A ) . To reconstitute the non - coding RNA components of the S . pyogenes type II CRISPR / Cas system , we expressed an 89 - nucleotide ( nt ) tracrRNA ( fig . S2 ) under the RNA polymerase III U6 promoter ( Fig . 1B ) . Sim - ilarly , we used the U6 promoter to drive the ex - pressionofapre - crRNAarraycomprisinga single guide spacer flanked by DRs ( Fig . 1B ) . We de - signed our initial spacer to target a 30 – base pair ( bp ) site ( protospacer ) in the human EMX1 locus that precedes an NGG trinucleotide , the requisite protospacer - adjacent motif ( PAM ) ( Fig . 1C and fig . S1 ) ( 22 , 23 ) . To test whether heterologous expression of the CRISPR system ( SpCas9 , SpRNase III , tracrRNA , and pre - crRNA ) can achieve targeted cleavage of mammalian chromosomes , we transfected 293FT cells with different combinations of CRISPR / Cas components . Because DSBs in mammalian DNA are partially repaired by the indel - forming non - homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) pathway , we used the SURVEYOR assay ( fig . S3 ) to detect en - dogenous target cleavage ( Fig . 1D and fig . S2B ) . Cotransfection of all four required CRISPR com - ponents resulted in efficient cleavage of the pro - tospacer ( Fig . 1D and fig . S2B ) , which was subsequently verified by Sanger sequencing ( Fig . 1E ) . SpRNase III was not necessary for cleavage of the protospacer ( Fig . 1D ) , and the 89 - nt tracrRNA is processed in its absence ( fig . S2C ) . Similarly , maturation of pre - crRNA does not re - quire RNase III ( Fig . 1D and fig . S4 ) , suggesting that there may be endogenous mammalian RNases that assist in pre - crRNA maturation ( 24 – 26 ) . Re - moving any of the remaining RNA or Cas9 com - ponents abolished the genome cleavage activity of the CRISPR / Cas system ( Fig . 1D ) . These re - sults define a minimal three - component system for efficient RNA - guided genome modification in mammalian cells . Next , we explored the generalizability of RNA - guided genome editing in eukaryotic cells by targeting additional protospacers within the EMX1 locus ( Fig . 2A ) . To improve codelivery , we designed an expression vector to drive both pre - crRNA and SpCas9 ( fig . S5 ) . In parallel , we adapted a chimeric crRNA - tracrRNA hybrid ( Fig . 2B , top ) design recently validated in vitro ( 12 ) , where a mature crRNA is fused to a partial tracrRNAvia a synthetic stem loop to mimic the natural crRNA : tracrRNA duplex ( Fig . 2B , bot - tom ) . We observed cleavage of all protospacer tar - gets when SpCas9 is coexpressed with pre - crRNA ( DR - spacer - DR ) and tracrRNA . However , not all chimeric RNA designs could facilitate cleavage of their genomic targets ( Fig . 2C and table S1 ) . We then tested targeting of additional genomic loci in both human and mouse cells by design - ing pre - crRNAs and chimeric RNAs targeting the human PVALB and the mouse Th loci ( fig . S6 ) . We achieved efficient modification at all three mouse Th and one PVALB targets by using the crRNA : tracrRNA duplex , thus demonstrating the broad applicability of the CRISPR / Cas system in modifying different loci across multiple orga - nisms ( table S1 ) . For the same protospacer targets , cleavage efficiencies of chimeric RNAs were either lower than those of crRNA : tracrRNA duplexes or undetectable . This may be due to differences in the expression and stability of RNAs , degradation by endogenous RNA interference machinery , or secondary structures leading to inefficient Cas9 loading or target recognition . Effective genome editing requires that nucle - ases target specific genomic loci with both high Fig . 1 .

To investigate the spec - ificity of RNA - guided genome modification , we analyzed single - nucleotide mismatches be - tween the spacer and its mammalian protospacer target ( Fig . 3A ) . We observed that single - base mismatch up to 11 bp 5 ′ of the PAM completely abolished genomic cleavage by SpCas9 , whereas spacers with mutations farther upstream retained activity against the protospacer target ( Fig . 3B ) . This is consistent with previous bacterial and in vitro studies of Cas9 specificity ( 12 , 20 ) . Further - more , SpCas9 is able to mediate genomic cleav - age as efficiently as a pair of TALE nucleases ( TALENs ) targeting the same EMX1 protospacer ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) . Targeted modification of genomes ideally avoids mutations arising from the error - prone NHEJ mechanism . The wild - type SpCas9 is able to mediate site - specific DSBs , which can be re - paired through either NHEJ or homology - directed repair ( HDR ) . We engineered an aspartate - to - alanine substitution ( D10A ) in the RuvC I do - main of SpCas9 to convert the nuclease into a DNA nickase ( SpCas9n , Fig . 4A ) ( 12 , 13 , 20 ) , because nicked genomic DNA is typically re - paired either seamlessly or through high - fidelity HDR .

However , nicked DNA can in rare cases be processed via a DSB intermediate and result in a NHEJ event ( 27 ) . We then tested Cas9 - mediated HDR at the same EMX1 locus with a homology repair template to introduce a pair of restriction sites near the protospacer ( Fig . 4C ) . SpCas9 and SpCas9n catalyzed integration of the repair template into EMX1 locus at similar levels ( Fig . 4D ) , which we further verified via Sanger sequencing ( Fig . 4E ) . These results demonstrate the utility of CRISPR for facilitating targeted ge - nomic insertions . Given the 14 - bp ( 12 bp from the seed sequence and 2 bp from PAM ) target spec - ificity ( Fig . 3B ) of the wild - type SpCas9 , the use of a nickase may reduce off - target mutations . Lastly , the natural architecture of CRISPR loci with arrayed spacers ( fig . S1 ) suggests the pos - sibility of multiplexed genome engineering . By using a single CRISPR array encoding a pair of EMX1 - and PVALB - targeting spacers , we de - tected efficient cleavage at both loci ( Fig . 4F ) . We further tested targeted deletion of larger ge - nomic regions through concurrent DSBs by using spacers against two targets within EMX1 spaced by 119 bp and observed a 1 . 6 % deletion efficacy ( 3 out of 182 amplicons , Fig . 4G ) , thus demon - strating the CRISPR / Cas system can mediate mul - tiplexed editing within a single genome . The ability to use RNA to program sequence - specific DNA cleavage defines a new class of ge - nome engineering tools . Here , we have shown that the S . pyogenes CRISPR system can be heterol - ogously reconstituted in mammalian cells to facil - itate efficient genome editing ; an accompanying study has independently confirmed high - efficiency RNA - guided genome targeting in several human cell lines ( 28 ) . However , several aspects of the CRISPR / Cas system can be further improved to increase its efficiency and versatility . The require - ment for an NGG PAM restricts the target space of SpCas9 to every 8 bp on average in the human genome ( fig . S7 ) , not accounting for potential constraints posed by crRNA secondary structure or genomic accessibility resulting from chroma - tin and DNA methylation states . Some of these restrictions may be overcome by exploiting the family of Cas9 enzymes and its differing PAM requirements ( 22 , 23 ) across the microbial diver - sity ( 17 ) . Indeed , other CRISPR loci are likely to be transplantable into mammalian cells ; for example , the Streptococcus thermophilus LMD - 9 CRISPR1 system can also mediate mammalian genome cleavage ( fig . S8 ) . Lastly , the ability to carry out multiplex genome editing in mamma - lian cells enables powerful applications across basic science , biotechnology , and medicine ( 29 ) .

Church 1 , 2 † Bacteria and archaea have evolved adaptive immune defenses , termed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR ) / CRISPR - associated ( Cas ) systems , that use short RNA to direct degradation of foreign nucleic acids . Here , we engineer the type II bacterial CRISPR system to function with custom guide RNA ( gRNA ) in human cells . For the endogenous AAVS1 locus , we obtained targeting rates of 10 to 25 % in 293T cells , 13 to 8 % in K562 cells , and 2 to 4 % in induced pluripotent stem cells . We show that this process relies on CRISPR components ; is sequence - specific ; and , upon simultaneous introduction of multiple gRNAs , can effect multiplex editing of target loci . We also compute a genome - wide resource of ~ 190 K unique gRNAs targeting ~ 40 . 5 % of human exons . Our results establish an RNA - guided editing tool for facile , robust , and multiplexable human genome engineering . B acterial and archaeal clustered regular - ly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR ) systems rely on CRISPR RNAs ( crRNAs ) in complex with CRISPR - associated ( Cas ) proteins to direct degradation of comple - mentary sequences present within invading viral and plasmid DNA ( 1 – 3 ) . A recent in vitro re - constitution of the Streptococcus pyogenes type II CRISPR system demonstrated that crRNA fused to a normally trans - encoded tracrRNA is sufficient to direct Cas9 protein to sequence - specifically cleavetargetDNAsequencesmatchingthecrRNA ( 4 ) . The fully defined nature of this two - component system suggested that it might function in the cells of eukaryotic organisms such as yeast , plants , and even mammals . By cleaving genomic se - quences targeted by RNA sequences ( 4 – 6 ) , such a system could greatly enhance the ease of genome engineering . Here , we engineer the protein and RNA com - ponents of this bacterial type II CRISPR system in human cells . We began by synthesizing a hu - man codon – optimized version of the Cas9 protein bearing a C - terminal SV40 nuclear localization signal and cloning it into a mammalian expres - sion system ( Fig . 1Aand fig . S1A ) . To directCas9 to cleave sequences of interest , we expressed crRNA - tracrRNA fusion transcripts , hereafter referred to as guide RNAs ( gRNAs ) , from the human U6 polymerase III promoter . Directly transcribing gRNAs allowed us to avoid recon - stituting the RNA - processing machinery used by bacterial CRISPR systems ( Fig . 1A and fig . S1B ) ( 4 , 7 – 9 ) . Constrained only by U6 transcription initiating with G and the requirement for the PAM ( protospacer - adjacent motif ) sequence - NGG fol - lowing the 20 – base pair ( bp ) crRNA target , our highly versatile approach can , in principle , tar - get any genomic site of the form GN 20 GG ( fig . S1C ; see supplementary text S1 for a detailed discussion ) . To test the functionality of our implemen - tation for genome engineering , we developed a green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) reporter assay ( Fig . 1B ) in human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cells similar to one previously described ( 10 ) . Specifically , we established a stable cell line bear - ing a genomically integrated GFP coding sequence disrupted by the insertion of a stop codon and a 68 - bp genomic fragment from the AAVS1 locus that renders the expressed protein fragment non - fluorescent . Homologous recombination ( HR ) using an appropriate repair donor can restore the normal GFP sequence , which enabled us to quan - tify the resulting GFP + cells by flow - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) . To test the efficiency of our system at stim - ulating HR , we constructed two gRNAs , T1 and T2 , that target the intervening AAVS1 fragment ( Fig . 1B ) and compared their activity to that of a previously described TAL effector nuclease het - erodimer ( TALEN ) targeting the same region ( 11 ) . We observed successful HR events using all three targeting reagents , with gene correction rates using the T1 and T2 gRNAs approaching 3 % and 8 % , respectively ( Fig . 1C ) . This RNA - mediated editing process was notably rapid , with the first detectable GFP + cells appearing ~ 20 hours post transfection compared with ~ 40 hours for the AAVS1 TALENs . We observed HR only upon simultaneous introduction of the repair donor , Cas9 protein , and gRNA , which confirmed that all components are required for genome editing ( fig . S2 ) . Although we noted no apparent toxic - ity associated with Cas9 / gRNA expression , work with zinc finger nucleases ( ZFNs ) and TALENs has shown that nicking only one strand further reduces toxicity . Accordingly , we also tested a Cas9D10A mutant that is known to function as a nickase in vitro , which yielded similar HR but lower nonhomologous end joining ( NHEJ ) rates ( fig . S3 ) ( 4 , 5 ) .
