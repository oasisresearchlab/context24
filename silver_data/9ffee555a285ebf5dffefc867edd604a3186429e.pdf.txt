Overex - pression of SKP2 Promotes the Radiation Resistance of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma . Radiat . Res . 177 , 52 – 58 ( 2012 ) . SKP2 is the substrate recognition subunit of the SCF SKP2 ubiquitin ligase complex . It is implicated in ubiquitin - mediated degradation of the cyclin - dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitor p27 KIP1 and positively regulates the G 1 / S transition . Overexpression of SKP2 has been found in many kinds of tumors . In the present study , we found that SKP2 expression levels increased in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissues . Elevated expression of SKP2 correlated significantly with tumor stage and positive lymph node metastasis ( P , 0 . 05 ) . Moreover , a significantly negative correlation was found between SKP2 expression and the survival of patients who received radiotherapy ( P , 0 . 05 ) . At the molecular level , induced expression of SKP2 promoted the radioresistance of EC9706 cells . Knockdown of SKP2 expression sensitized cancer cells to radiation , and a wobble mutant of SKP2 that was resistant to SKP2 siRNA was able to rescue this effect . Increased or decreased expression levels of SKP2 had effects on Rad51 expression after irradiation . These results demon - strate for the first time that overexpression of SKP2 was correlated with the increased radioresistance of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma . Elevated expression of SKP2 promoted the radioresistance of cancer cells , and this effect was mediated at least in part by the Rad51 pathway . (cid:2) 2012by Radiation Research Society INTRODUCTION Esophageal carcinoma is a highly malignant disease with an overall 5 - year survival rate of less than 10 % . The worldwide incidence of esophageal carcinoma is increasing , particularly for adenocarcinoma located in the lower esophagus and gastroesophageal junction . In contrast to Western countries , esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) is the most prevalent type of esophageal carcinoma in China . Radiotherapy has the widest applicability to ESCC patients and plays a central role in contemporary treatment protocols ( 1 ) . Unfortunately , local failure has remained a major concern , with persistent or recurrent disease being reported in around 40 – 60 % of patients ( 2 ) . Thus radiosensitization of tumor cells is a promising approach to improve the therapeutic ratio for radiotherapy . SKP2 is the substrate recognition subunit of the SCF SKP2 ubiquitin ligase complex and was originally identified as a protein that interacts with cyclin A ( 3 ) . This protein is implicated in ubiquitin - mediated degradation of the cyclin - dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitor p27 KIP1 and positively regulates the G 1 / S transition . Targeted inactivation of the SKP2 gene results in accumulation of p27 and cyclin E and causes a cell cycle blocked in G 1 phase ( 4 ) . SKP2 is frequently overexpressed in tumor cell lines , and forced expression of SKP2 in quiescent fibroblasts induces DNA synthesis ( 5 ) . Elevated SKP2 expression has been demon - strated in carcinomas of breast , colorectum , lung and stomach and in lymphomas ( 6 – 9 ) . Our previous study showed that overexpression of SKP2 suppressed the anoikis and promoted the metastasis of ESCC ( 9 ) . Up to now , there are no reports whether SKP2 has effects on radiotherapy for ESCC . In the present study , we found for the first time that SKP2 expression correlated with the prognosis of ESCC patients who received radiotherapy . Increased SKP2 level improved the radioresistance of ESCC cells , and this role was mediated at least in part by the Rad51 pathway . MATERIALS AND METHODS Tissue Specimens Sixty fresh tissues containing esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and adjacent histologically normal epithelia were procured from surgical resection specimens collected by the Department of Pathology in Cancer Hospital , Shandong province , China . Primary tumor regions Note . The online version of this article ( DOI : 10 . 1667 / RR2679 . 1 ) contains supplementary information that is available to all authorized users . 1 Address for correspondence : Institute of Radiation Medicine , Chinese Academy of Medical Science , Tianjin 300192 , China ; e - mail : wxc3188 @ 126 . com . 52 and the corresponding histological normal esophageal mucosa from the same patients were separated by experienced pathologists and immediately stored at (cid:2) 70 8 C until use . All patients received no treatment before surgery and signed informed consent forms for sample collection . Forty - two of the 60 patients received concurrent chemotherapy with radiation therapy after surgery . Radiation therapy was administered in daily divided doses with linear accelerators , and all patients received thoracic irradiation with daily fraction doses of 2 . 0 Gy for a total dose 50 Gy . The chemotherapy program was cisplatin ( CDDP ) þ 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) . The other 18 patients were treated with only chemotherapy . The use of patient samples of tumor and adjacent histologically normal tissues was approved by the institutional ethics committee . Immunohistochemical Staining A total of 60 formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and the corresponding normal epithelia were collected for immunohistochemical analysis . The slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated and then immersed in 3 % hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 min , heated in EDTA buffer , pH 8 . 0 , at 95 8 C for 25 min , and cooled at room temperature for 60 min . The slides were blocked by 10 % normal goat serum at 37 8 C for 30 min and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody against SKP2 ( 1 : 200 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) overnight at 37 8 C . After washing with PBS , the slides were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody ( diluted 1 : 100 ) for 30 min at 37 8 C followed by streptavidin - peroxidase ( 1 : 100 dilution ) incubation at 37 8 C for 30 min . Immunolabeling was visualized with a mixture of DAB solution . Counterstaining was carried out with hematoxylin . The expression of SKP2 was determined by staining intensity and by the percentage of immunoreactive cells . The staining intensity was scored as follows : negative for complete absent staining , positive for weak staining , and strong positive for strong staining . The extent of positively stained nuclei was scored as follows : 0 for , 10 % , 1 for 10 – 30 % , and 2 for . 30 % . The final score for each tumor sample represents the sum of staining intensity and extent of staining ( 10 , 11 ) . Plasmid Construction and Small Interfering RNA Synthesis The PSuppressorNeo expression vector was applied to generate biologically active siRNAs for sustained gene knockdown . The sequence of insert SKP2 siRNA was prepared by synthesizing and annealing two complementary oligonucleotides : SKP2 5 0 - tcgaGG GAGTGACAAAGACTTTGgagtactgCAAAGTCTTTGTCACTCCCTTTTT - 3 0 and 5 0 - ctagAAAAAGGGAGTGACAAAGACTTTG CagtactcCAAAGTCTTTGTCACTCCC - 3 0 ( 12 ) . A scrambled se - quence without significant homology to human gene sequences was used as a control . pcDNA3 . 1 - SKP2 ovexpression vector and mutant pcDNA3 . 1 - SKP2 preserving the same amino acid sequence , but containing three point mutations ( 879 , 885 , 890 ) in the target nucleotide sequence and therefore resistant to SKP2 - shRNA , were produced by GeneChem ( Shanghai , China ) . Cell Culture and Transfection The esophageal squamous cell carcinoma EC9706 cell line was kindly donated by Professor Wang ( Cancer Institute ( Hospital ) , Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences ) . Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % FBS . Cell transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . In transient transfections , 100 n M SKP2 siRNA or scrambled siRNA was used , and cells were harvested 48 h after transfection . In the stable transfection , cells were selected with 200 l g / ml G418 and clones were isolated by serial dilution . The pool of SKP2 - overexpressing and SKP2 RNAi clones was chosen for subsequent experiments . Western Blot Analysis Whole cell extracts were prepared from ESCC tissues and cultured cells by homogenizing cells in a lysis buffer [ 10 m M Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 m M NaCl , 1 % NP40 ] containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors . After centrifugation at 15 , 000 RCF for 30 min at 4 8 C , supernatants were recovered and used for immunoblot analysis . The proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membranes ( Millipore ) . Blots were blocked and then probed with antibodies against SKP2 , Rad51 , Ku70 and p27 all at 1 : 500 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . After washing , the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated second - ary antibodies and visualized by super ECL detection reagent ( Applygen , Beijing , China ) . Irradiation EC9706 cells exposed to different doses of radiation in a J . L . Shepherd Model 143 137 Cs irradiator at a dose rate of 2 . 4 Gy / min . Colony Formation Assay Four hundred cells were transferred into each well of a 6 - well plate in triplicate and exposed to different doses of c rays . After 10 days of incubation , the colonies were stained with Giemsa stain and a minimum of 50 viable cells were counted . Quantity One software ( version 4 . 6 . 2 ) was used to analyze the results . c - H2AX Focus Formation Assay Briefly , cells were grown on cover slips that were kept in 35 - mm petri plates and irradiated with different doses ( 0 , 2 , 4 and 6 Gy ) of c rays . Cell layers were washed with PBS and fixed for 20 min in 4 % paraformaldehyde at room temperature . Then the cells were washed twice in PBS . For immunofluorescence staining , cells were permea - bilized for 3 min in 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 in PBS , washed two times in PBS , and blocked for 1 h with 5 % BSA in PBS . Antibodies were diluted ( 1 : 200 ) in 1 % BSA in PBS . Cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h 30 min at room temperature , washed three times in PBS , and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature . Finally , cells were rinsed and mounted with ProLong Gold antifade with DAPI mounting medium ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) . Images were captured using a Carl Zeiss confocal microscope . Acquisition settings were optimized to obtain maximal signal in immunostained cells with minimal background . Two hundred nuclei were counted . All experiments were carried out in triplicate , independent from each other . The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti - c - H2AX ( Cell Signaling , Danvers , MA ) . Secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti - rabbit IgG ( Molecular Probes ) . Flow Cytometry Cells were harvested 8 h postirradiation for detection of apoptosis using the Annexin V - FITC apoptosis detection kit ( Sigma ) and were subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry . Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS16 . 0 software . Experimental results were evaluated using a v 2 test and ANOVA . Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan - Meier method . P , 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . RESULTS Overexpression of SKP2 Correlated with Overall Survival of ESCC Patients Receiving Radiotherapy First we examined the expression of SKP2 in ESCC using immunohistochemistry . The results showed that in normal CORRELATION BETWEEN SKP2 EXPRESSION AND RADIORESISTANCE IN ESCC 53 epithelia , most cells either did not show SKP2 expression or showed weak expression . In contrast to the normal epithelia , high expression of SKP2 was observed in 40 of 60 ( 66 % ) ESCCs ( Fig . 1 ) . Statistical analysis indicated that elevated expression of SKP2 was significantly associated with tumor stage and positive lymph node metastasis ( P , 0 . 05 ) ( Table 1 ) . Next , we analyzed the correlation between SKP2 expression and prognosis using Kaplan - Meier analysis . No association was found between SKP2 expression and overall survival ( P ¼ 0 . 539 ) ( Fig . 2A ) . In the patients who did not receive radiotherapy ( 18 out of 60 ) , no difference was found between patients with high and low levels of expression of SKP2 ( Fig . 2B ) . In contrast , in the patients received concurrent chemotherapy with radiation therapy ( 42 out of 60 ) , the survival rate of patients with low with SKP2 expression was higher than that of patients with high expression ( Fig . 2C ) . These results showed that the SKP2 expression status may have effects on the radiotherapy outcome of ESCC patients . SKP2 Expression Increased after Irradiation in ESCC Cells To explore if there was a correlation between SKP2 expression and the radiation response of ESCC cells , we examined the SKP2 expression in EC9706 cells at 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 and 12 h after irradiation with a dose of 5 Gy . SKP2 expression was increased after irradiation and was highest at 4 h ( Fig . 3 ) , showing that SKP2 may affect the radiosensitivity of EC9706 cells . Effects of SKP2 Expression on the Radiosensitivity of EC9706 Cells A colony formation assay was performed to examine the effects of SKP2 expression on the radiosensitivity of EC9706 cells . The surviving fraction of cells with induced SKP2 expression was higher than that of control cells ( Fig . 4A and B ) . Conversely , the surviving fraction of SKP2 knockdown cells was significantly lower than that of control cells ( Fig . 4C and D ) . These results indicated a correlation between SKP2 expression and sensitivity of EC9706 cells to c radiation . To verify that the effects of RNAi described above are specific , we prepared a SKP2 construct bearing a triple - point mutation in the 19 - bp sequence that served as target for shRNA - mediated knockdown in our experiments . The mutation conserved the amino acid sequence of the SKP2 protein but rendered its expression insensitive to inhibition by the shRNA . Transfection of this mutant shRNA into the cells with stable expression of SKP2 - shRNA restored the ability of SKP2 to promote the radioresistance of EC9706 cells ( Fig . 4C and D ) . FIG . 1 .

We also examined the effects of SKP2 expression on the proliferation of EC9706 cells using MTT experiments . The results indicated that the proliferation ability of cells increased in cells with high SKP2 levels but decreased in SKP2 knockdown cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ; http : / / doi . org . 10 . 1667 / RR2679 . 1 . S1 ) . Expression of SKP2 Affected the Repair of DSBs Induced by Radiation via Rad51 To investigate whether SKP2 expression affected the ability to repair DNA damage induced by c rays , we performed c - H2AX focus formation assay 40 min postir - radiation . The amount of c - H2AX foci in SKP2 knockdown cells was significantly higher than that in control cells after irradiation ( P , 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 5A ) . In accord with these results , the percentage of apoptotic cells with low SKP2 levels was significantly higher than that in control cells ( P , 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 5B ) . Conversely , the number of c - H2AX foci in cells with induced SKP2 expression decreased signifi - cantly ( Fig . 5C ) . The percentage of apoptotic cells with high SKP2 levels was significantly lower than that in control cells ( P , 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 5D ) . These data showed that SKP2 expression can affect the ability to repair DSBs induced by radiation . We next examined the expression of two key proteins , Rad51 and Ku70 , which was correlated with DNA double - strand break ( DSB ) repair . As shown in Fig . 6A , Rad51 expression decreased after SKP2 knockdown in irradiated cells . The p27 expression increased , but the Ku70 level did not change . Induced expression of SKP2 contributed to the expression of Rad51 irradiated cells and Ku70 expression was not affected , but p27 expression decreased ( Fig . 6B ) . DISCUSSION Overexpression of SKP2 has been observed in various types of human tumors and elevated expression of SKP2 has indicated a poor prognoses for patients with colorectal carcinoma ( 13 ) , oral squamous cell carcinoma ( 8 , 11 ) , laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( 9 ) , lymphoma ( 14 ) , gastric cancer ( 6 ) , breast cancer ( 15 ) , and prostate cancer ( 16 ) . Fukuchi et al . reported that expression levels of SKP2 FIG . 2 . Kaplan - Meier survival curve of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) patients subgrouped as SKP2 - negative or positive . Panel A : No difference was found between SKP2 expression and the overall survival of the 60 ESCC patients . Panel B : No difference was found between SKP2 expression and the overall survival of patients who received only chemotherapy . Panel C : A significant difference was found between SKP2 expression and overall survival of patients received concurrent chemotherapy with radiotherapy . The prognosis of SKP2 - positive cases was significantly shorter than that of SKP2 - negative cases ( P ¼ 0 . 036 ) . FIG . 3 . Expression of SKP2 induced by radiation in EC9706 cells .

CORRELATION BETWEEN SKP2 EXPRESSION AND RADIORESISTANCE IN ESCC 55 and p27 were negatively correlated in early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( 17 ) . Our previous studies indicated that SKP2 was amplified and overexpressed in ESCC . Its overexpression correlated significantly with tumor stage and positive lymph node metastasis ( 9 ) . In the present study , we examined the SKP2 expression in another 60 specimens , and the results agreed with those of our previous study . However , in our previous study , we did not analyze the correlation of SKP2 expression with prognosis , so we performed this analysis in the present study . We found that SKP2 expression has no effects on the overall survival of ESCC patients . Some patients in our study received radiotherapy and others did not , while the chemotherapy treatment was same in all these 60 patients , so we wanted to know if SKP2 expression affected radiotherapy outcome . The results showed that patients with low SKP2 expression survived longer than patients with high SKP2 expression after radiotherapy . However , SKP2 had no effects on survival time in patients who did not receive radiotherapy . This is the first report of a correlation between SKP2 expression and radiotherapy . To confirm the clinical data , we explored the correlation between SKP2 expression and radiosensitivity in ESCC cells . SKP2 expression levels increased after 5 Gy irradiation , showing that SKP2 may affect the radiation response of EC9706 cells . The colony formation and MTT assays showed that increased SKP2 levels prompted the radiation resistance of EC9706 cells . This was further confirmed by positive transfection , RNAi and rescue experiments . The radiosensitivity of cells is influenced by many factors , of which the ability to repair DNA DSBs is one of the most important . If the damage induced by radiation can be efficiently repaired , the cell will survive ; otherwise , it will undergo apoptosis . Given that our data showed that overexpression of SKP2 increased the radiation resistance of ESCC cells , we hypothesize that if SKP2 affects the ability to repair DSBs induced by radiation in EC9706 cells . The results of the c - H2AX focus experiments supported our hypothesis . There are two methods of repairing DSBs , homologous recombination ( HR ) and non - homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) . RAD51 is a key protein in the HR DNA repair pathway . It is the major strand transferase required for mitotic recombination ( 18 ) . The NHEJ pathway repairs the DNA by a homology - independent mechanism that rejoins broken ends irrespective of the sequence . Upon exposure to different genotoxic insults , the Ku70 / 80 heterodimer ( Ku ) binds to the DNA broken ends and recruits the catalytic subunit of the DNA - dependent protein kinase ( DNA - PKcs ) . The formation of this complex results in the subsequent recruitment and phosphorylation of other proteins such as XRCC4 , DNA Ligase IV , Cernunnos / XLF and Artemis so as to ligate the DNA broken ends ( 19 ) . To further explore the molecular mechanism of SKP2 that affects DSB repair , we then examined the expression of RAD51 and Ku70 FIG . 5 . Panel A : The number of c - H2AX foci per nucleus in SKP2 knockdown cells was significantly higher than that in control cells 40 min postirradiation ( P , 0 . 01 ) . Bars represent means 6 SD of c - H2AX foci in unirradiated and irradiated cells . Two hundred nuclei were analyzed per condition . Panel B : The percentage of apoptotic cells in the SKP2 knockdown group was significantly higher than that in control groups after irradiation ( P , 0 . 05 ) . Panel C : The number of c - H2AX foci per nucleus in induced SKP2 cells was significant lower than that in control cells ( P , 0 . 05 ) . Panel D : The percentage of apoptotic cells in induced SKP2 expression cells was significantly lower than that in control groups ( P , 0 . 05 ) . 56 WANG ET AL . under conditions of SKP2 knockdown and induced expression after irradiation . The results indicated that SKP2 affected only the expression of Rad51 . Overexpres - sion of Rad51 protein has been reported to stimulate homologous recombination and to increase the resistance of mammalian cells to ionizing radiation ( 20 ) . Those results combined with our data suggest that overexpression of SKP2 can promote the ability to repair DSB induced by radiation in EC9706 cells and that this effect was mediated at least in part by the RAD51 pathway . p27 was one of the main substrates of SKP2 , and its expression level increased after SKP2 knockdown . Given that p27 is one of the main regulators of the cell cycle and that RAD51 is regulated in a cell cycle - dependent manner , there may be some correla - tions between p27 and RAD51 . We will explore this in a future study . In conclusion , we found for the first time that SKP2 expression correlated with the prognosis of ESCC patients who received radiotherapy . Increased SKP2 levels promot - ed the DSB repair ability of ESCC cells at least in part through the HR pathway , thereby improving the radiation resistance of ESCC cells .
