It is known that actin ﬁlaments are bundled hexagonally and provide rigidity to ﬁlopodia by virtue of fascin , which plays a central role in actin ﬁlament bundling . However , the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation remain unclear . Here , we observed the ﬁlopodia of intact whole cells ﬁxed by rapid freezing and revealed their three - dimensional structure by cryo - electron tomography and image proc - essing ; the actin ﬁlament bundling structure by fascin was clariﬁed at high resolution under physiological conditions . It was found that actin ﬁlaments in vivo were more numerous than in bundles reconstructed in vitro , and each ﬁlopodial actin ﬁlament had limited variability in helical twisting . In addition , statistical analysis of actin ﬁlament bundles unveiled their detailed architecture . In ﬁlopodia , actin ﬁlaments had highly ordered structures , and the shift between cross - links of each adjacent actin ﬁlament was approximately 2 . 7 nm , similar to the monomer repeat of actin ﬁla - ments . We then proposed a plausible actin - fascin cross - link model at the amino acid level and identiﬁed three fascin binding sites on two adjacent actin ﬁlaments : one ﬁlament bound fascin at two discrete , widely sepa - rated regions and the other bound fascin in a single small region . We propose that these two different bind - ing modalities should confer rigid bundles that retain ﬂexibility and dynamic performance . V C 2016 Wiley Periodicals , Inc . Key Words : structural biology ; cell biology ; cryo electron tomography ; image processing ; 3D reconstruction Introduction F ilopodia are located at the leading edges of cells and exhibit characteristic structures , such as ﬁnger - like pro - trusions and thin structures . The thickness of a typical ﬁlo - podium is around 200 - 400 nm . Filopodia function like antennae and detect their surrounding environment . They are involved in numerous processes , such as cell migration , neurite outgrowth , wound healing , cancer cell invasion , etc . [ Mattila and Lappalainen , 2008 ; Huang et al . , 2015 ] . Actin ﬁlaments belong to a family of cytoskeletal proteins and are bundled by fascin with a periodicity of around 36 nm [ Yang et al . , 2013 ] . The bundling mechanism is closely related to the formation and function of ﬁlopodia . Addi - tionally , fascin has been recently studied as a novel target for anti - cancer drugs [ Hu et al . , 2000 ; Van Audenhove et al . , 2014 ; Huang et al . , 2015 ] . Nevertheless , the signiﬁ - cance of the mechanisms underlying ﬁlopodial formation and function remain unclear . Recently , the crystal structure of fascin and the high - resolution EM ( electron microscopy ) structure of actin ﬁla - ments under in vitro conditions have been revealed with the development of structural analysis technologies [ Fujii et al . , 2010 ; Murakami et al . , 2010 ; Jansen et al . , 2011 ; Yang et al . , 2013 ] . Actin ﬁlaments are essential for main - taining cellular morphology , and fascin is necessary for bun - dling actin ﬁlaments and producing the characteristic structures of ﬁlopodia . Actin forms a ﬁlamentous structure that is composed of 5 - nm monomers . The actin monomers align with a 2 . 73 - nm intermonomer distance and form left - handed single helix or right - handed double helix structures [ Moore et al . , 1970 ] . Actin ﬁlaments possess two tips , a plus or barbed end ( assembly is dominant ) and a minus or Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online ver - sion of this article . * Address correspondence to : Takuo Yasunaga , Department of Bio - science and Bioinformatics , Kyushu Institute of Technology , 680 - 4 Kawazu , Iizuka , Fukuoka 820 - 8502 , Japan .

The barbed end is oriented toward the protruding region and the pointed end is oriented toward the cell’s central region [ Small and Celis , 1978 ] . Additionally , actin ﬁlaments always ﬂow from the protrusion region to the central cell body in a process described as a treadmill reaction , which is a very dynamic phenomenon . The dynamics and structure of actin ﬁla - ments are an important component of ﬁlopodia . Fascin cross - links parallel actin ﬁlaments by binding to three - actin ﬁlament binding domains and functions as a monomer that lacks symmetrical structures [ Yang et al . , 2013 ] . Photo - bleaching experiments have been used to demonstrate that the association and disassociation of fascin are more dynamic than the actin ﬁlament treadmill reaction [ Aratyn et al . , 2007 ] . Regardless of its properties , fascin functions to arrange actin ﬁlaments with a highly ordered structure to maintain the stiffness of ﬁlopodia . Individual in vitro structures and biochemical properties of these proteins have been studied . However , it is crucial to understand the architecture of actin ﬁlament networks and the proteins that play fundamental roles in the high protein density environments of cells . Therefore , it is important to understand their structure in in vivo environ - ments . In this study , we revealed actin ﬁlament bundling mechanisms mediated by fascin in ﬁlopodia using cryo - electron tomography ( cryo - ET ) [ Medalia et al . , 2002 ] . However , vitriﬁed biological samples are easily damaged by high - dose electron beams ; therefore , the observations were performed using low - dose ( electron beam ) conditions that resulted in low signal - to - noise ratios and low contrast images . As a result , image processing techniques were applied to the raw cryo - ET images to improve the resolu - tion of the three - dimensional ( 3D ) data for subsequent quantitative image analysis . In this study , we focused on revealing the fascin - bundled actin ﬁlament network at high - resolution using cryo - ET and image processing technologies in an effort to under - stand the actin ﬁlament bundling architecture in ﬁlopodia under physiological conditions . Finally , we characterized the fascin - mediated actin ﬁlament bundling mechanisms in ﬁlopodia under in vivo conditions . Results and Discussion Identiﬁcation of Cross - Linked Filaments and the Bundling Architecture In cellular environments with intact ﬁlopodia , tilt - series images were acquired by using cryo - TEM with a CCD camera and a post - column type energy ﬁlter . After acquir - ing the tilt - series of each ﬁlopodium ( Supporting Informa - tion Fig . S1 ) , the contrast transfer functions ( CTF ) were determined and corrected manually . We successfully recon - structed the 3D maps of ﬁlopodia ( Fig . 1 ) and clearly eluci - dated the cell membrane and architecture of the bundled ﬁlaments , which are presumably actin . The 3D maps of ﬁlopodia were 100 – 200 nm in thickness ( Supporting Infor - mation Figs . S1 and S2 ) , which corresponds to typical ﬁlo - podial thickness , although the central region was a little distended , as shown in Fig . 1B with ( * ) . Interestingly , there was no density that connected bundled ﬁlaments to the cell membranes in both the distended ( * ) and nondistended ( * * ) regions in Fig . 1B . These observations are consistent with reported actin dynamics in ﬁlopodia [ Aratyn et al . , 2007 ] . The longitudinal tomogram along the bundles showed that ﬁlamentous structures were bundled and aligned regu - larly with an approximately 36 nm repeat , as indicated by the red arrowheads in Fig . 1B . Each observed ﬁlament exhibited a somewhat wavy , striped , and similarly periodical appearance , indicating a helical symmetry in the ﬁlament structure . The distance between adjacent ﬁlaments was (cid:2) 12 . 26 nm ( SD : 0 . 70 / SE : 0 . 02 ) and their surfaces were (cid:2) 4 . 99 nm ( SD : 0 . 72 / SE : 0 . 02 ) apart because the ﬁlaments were (cid:2) 6 – 7 nm in thickness ( Figs . 2B and 2D and Support - ing Information Fig . S3 ) . The interﬁlament distance we observed was similar to the 11 . 2 - nm distance reported by Yang et al . [ 2013 ] . This implies that the observed bundles are composed of actin ﬁlaments cross - linked by fascin , as subsequently described . In addition , we clearly observed more than thirty ﬁla - ments and cross - bridges between interﬁlaments , which were packed hexagonally , as shown in Fig . 1C and Supporting Information Fig . S2 . This hexagonal packing is similar to yet distinct from that of previously described in vitro mod - els . Speciﬁcally , each ﬁlament can potentially be cross - linked from three different directions , as indicated by Fig . 1C ( a ) 0 8 , ( b ) 60 . 77 8 ( SD : 3 . 31 / SE : 0 . 25 ) , and ( c ) 120 . 51 8 ( SD : 2 . 89 / SE : 0 . 22 ) . Interestingly , cross - linking from only two directions ( Fig . 1C ( b ) 60 . 8 8 and ( c ) 120 . 5 8 ) was observed and the adjacent ﬁlaments were not cross - linked as in Fig . 1C ( a ) 0 8 . Furthermore , the direction of cross - linking was consistent through all observed bundles in a ﬁlopodium . In Fig . 2A , a schematic diagram of the actin bundle in the ﬁlopodium is shown and includes a descrip - tion of the observed ﬁlament longitudinal shift . In order to verify that the observed ﬁlaments in the bun - dles are composed of actin , we extracted each ﬁlament from the tomograms ( projected images of 15 nm thickness ) and performed fast Fourier transformation ( FFT ) analysis after projection to two - dimensional ( 2D ) images . As a result , the averaged FFT spectrum showed layer lines attributed to the helical symmetry of actin , shown in Supporting Informa - tion Fig . S4 . Thus , the periodic repeat of 36 . 8 nm corre - sponded to a half pitch of the double actin ﬁlament helix , consistent with the reported value of 36 . 9 nm [ Jansen et al . , 2011 ] . In addition to the averaged FFT analysis , we per - formed a distribution analysis of each nonaveraged single actin ﬁlament [ Supporting Information Fig . S4 ( inset ) ] . Pure actin ﬁlaments are known to exhibit a variety of twists (cid:2) 2 Aramaki et al . CYTOSKELETON [ Edelman et al . , 1982 ] ; however , the ﬁlopodial actin ﬁla - ments solved herein exhibited a relatively low variety of twists around 2 166 . 64 ( SD : 0 . 39 / SE : 0 . 09 SEM ) . These results suggest that the helical symmetry of actin ﬁlaments is affected when they are cross - linked in ﬁlopodia . In order to verify the identiﬁcation of the observed cross - bridges , we extracted , aligned , and averaged cross - linking regions in ﬁlopodia as shown in Supporting Information Fig . S5 . The cross - bridges were found to be (cid:2) 6 nm 3 (cid:2) 7 nm 3 (cid:2) 6 nm in size . Their size is similar to that of in vitro fascin [ Jansen et al . , 2011 ] , which functions as a cross - bridging factor in ﬁlopodia [ Mattila and Lappalainen , 2008 ] . In addition , Fig . 3A shows that the averaged EM maps ﬁt the atomic coordinates of fascin ( 3P53 ) from X - ray crystallography by rigid - modeling using UCSF Chimera [ Pettersen et al . , 2004 ] ; the correlation value was 0 . 9803 at a 2 . 0 - nm resolution . To verify the validity of the orientation of the fascin model in the averaged map , we compared each correlation value from four orientations ( Supporting Infor - mation Fig . S6 ) and concluded that the size of the cross - bridges can be attributed to fascin . In addition , our lattice structures of actin bundles in ﬁlo - podia resemble those reconstructed with fascin under in vitro conditions [ Yang et al . , 2013 ] , although we could clearly identify transversal and longitudinal cross - bridging , as shown in Fig . 1C and Supporting Information Fig . S2 . Cross - bridges were not observed in direction ( a ) , but cross - bridges in both directions ( b ) 60 . 8 8 and ( c ) 120 . 5 8 ( Fig . 1C ) were regularly bound to actin ﬁlaments with an (cid:2) 36 nm repeat and were shifted by (cid:2) 12 nm / (cid:2) 24 nm with each other , as shown in Supporting Information Fig . S7 . The cross - bridge distance observed here ( (cid:2) 36 nm ) is con - sistent with the model proposed in a previous report [ Yang et al . , 2013 ] ( (cid:2) 35 nm ) , rather than their actual mean ( 33 . 3 nm ) measurement . Interestingly , the regularity of cross - bridges bound to actin ﬁlaments in ﬁlopodia was Fig . 1 . 3D structure of a filopodium and intracellular filaments of a neuronal model cell ( NG108 - 15 ) acquired with cryo - ET . ( A ) A 3D map of a filopodium is shown . After segmentation , filamentous structures , cell membrane , and a 10 - nm gold marker are in red , blue , and yellow , respectively . A highly ordered bundled filamentous structure can be clearly observed . ( B ) Tomogram at the center of the filopodium with a thickness of 5 nm . The slice corresponds to that in the plane indicated in Figure 1 ( C ) - ( a ) . The slice image was smoothed with a median filter for reducing noise . As a result , the cell membrane of the filopodium is clearly observed , whereas its lipid - bilayer structure was not resolved . The periodicity of the bundled filamentous structure is shown using “ > ” and “ < ” with 36 - nm helical repeats . The diameter of the filopodium was 100 nm at its thinnest region ( * * ) and 250 nm at its thickest region ( * ) . In both regions , no direct contact densities between bundled filament structures and the cell membrane were observed . ( C ) Tomo - gram with a 90 nm thickness whose projection area is shown at the broken lines in ( B ) is presented in the longitudinal direction of the filaments . The filamentous structures were bundled hexagonally by cross - linking proteins . The filaments were cross - linked at ( b ) a 60 8 / 240 8 direction and ( c ) a 120 8 / 30 8 direction , while ( a ) cross - linking was not observed in the 0 8 / 180 8 direction .

The projected images were created along a longitudinal direction with 36 nm thickness such as in ( C ) . The density centers of each actin filament were then calculated and angles were determined by least squares regression analysis . As a result , the cross - bridge angles in the 60 8 ( C - b ) and 120 8 planes ( C - c ) are 60 . 77 8 ( SD : 3 . 31 / SE : 0 . 25 ) and 59 . 49 8 ( 120 . 51 8 ) ( SD : 2 . 89 / SE : 0 . 22 ) , respectively . The average cross - bridge angle was 60 . 1 8 ( SD : 3 . 18 / SE : 0 . 17 ) . Therefore , actin filaments were packed in an ordered hexagonal structure .

Presumably , the shift between cross - bridges could be observed because of the higher resolution of tomograms , and is an interesting consideration for bundling architecture . Thus , from the observed cross - bridge structure and bundling architecture , we conclude that the cross - bridges in ﬁlopodia are com - posed of fascin . Here , we describe a number of features of the architecture of actin - fascin bundles in ﬁlopodia . First , we have quantitated the number of actin ﬁlaments in ﬁlopodia . More than 30 ﬁla - ments are bundled in our observed ﬁlopodia ( Fig . 1C ) , which was composed of 28 long and 3 short actin ﬁlaments located at the periphery of the bundle . We also observed bundles con - taining more than 100 ﬁlaments . Interestingly , these bundles were composed of a few bundles of approximately 30 ﬁla - ments each , which have different packing regularities ( Sup - porting Information Fig . S2 ) . In our reconstructed ﬁlopodia , we did not observe stable bundles composed of less than 28 actin ﬁlaments , or bundles with a thickness greater than 100 nm ( N 5 20 ) . In comparison , the maximum size of actin ﬁlament bundles in vitro is (cid:2) 20 ﬁlaments [ Claessens et al . , 2008 ; Yang et al . , 2013 ] . Claessens et al . proposed that the reason for this inability to grow beyond 20 ﬁlaments in vitro is likely due to geometrical restrictions [ Claessens et al . , 2008 ] . On the other hand , Mogilner and Rubinstein pre - dicted that 30 ﬁlaments are optimal for ﬁlopodia due to G - actin diffusion [ Mogilner and Rubinstein , 2005 ] . Our obser - vations are consistent with the latter proposal ; however , thicker bundle complexes could be built in ﬁlopodia since bundles composed of approximately 30 actin ﬁlaments have the same unit regularity . The reason why thicker stable bun - dles were present in vivo might be related to the higher pro - tein density in cells than that in vitro , which stabilizes actin ﬁlament bundles and enables the formation of thicker bun - dles than under in vitro conditions , and / or due to other acces - sory proteins modulating bundle characteristics . Fig . 2 . Actin bundling architecture in filopodia . ( A ) Schematic diagram of an actin bundling architecture corresponding to that of Fig . 1C . The numbers in the diagram indicate regularity as it relates to the amount of longitudinal shift in actin filaments ; the stand - ard position is indexed as “0 , ” shown in cyan , and “ 1 1” corresponds to a 2 . 73 - nm shift to the plus - end of the standard actin fila - ment along the filament axis . The direction and amount of the shifts were estimated from each tomogram by comparison with the atomic coordinates of the actin filament ( PDB ID : 3G37 ) . When a fascin molecule cross - linked two adjacent actin filaments , it was found that fascin produced a shift 1 1 or 2 1 . Conversely , when planes without cross - linked structures were observed , the differences in shifts between two adjacent actin filaments were 1 2 , 2 2 , or 0 . The cyan box indicates a region of interest for the bundling mech - anism . ( B ) Tomogram with a thickness of 5 nn indicating the subvolume depicted in ( A ) with a red broken line , whose direction of projection is shown with a red arrow . The observed filament cross - linking structures are indicated as “ > ” and “ < , ” and their perio - dicity was 36 nm . In addition , the crossings of adjacent actin filaments were shifted relative to each other by approximately 15 8 rela - tive to the parallel plane as shown with the red line . Therefore , the shift amounts between each actin filament were approximately 2 . 73 nm ( (cid:3) 12 . 3 nm 3 tan ( 12 . 5 8 ) ) , which corresponds to 2 . 73 nm ( 1 1 or 2 1 ) . ( C ) Tomograms indicating the location of fascin molecules binding to the edge filament of actin bundles . The images are projected in a thickness of 5 nm . Red arrowheads show pro - trusions located at the edge of actin filaments . Regardless of the absence of an adjacent lateral filament , the protrusions bound to the actin filaments with 36 nm periodicity . Scale bar 5 36 nm . ( D ) Distribution of twisting angles of wavy structures . The 60 . 8 8 plane is shown in open squares , while the 120 . 5 8 plane is shown in striped squares . Fascin cross - linked actin filament structures are highly consistent . The average of fascin tilting angles in the 60 . 8 8 and 120 . 5 8 planes are 12 . 15 8 ( SD : 3 . 32 / SE : 0 . 33 ) and 12 . 77 8 ( SD : 3 . 86 / SE : 0 . 38 ) , respectively . The average value in the two directions is 12 . 46 8 ( SD : 3 . 61 / SE : 0 . 25 ) . [ Color figure can be viewed in the online issue , which is available at wileyonlinelibrary . com . ] (cid:2) 4 Aramaki et al . CYTOSKELETON Secondly , we observed the cross - bridge alignment regu - larity through actin ﬁlaments , and particularly noted the shift of (cid:2) 12 nm / (cid:2) 24 nm . In support of this observation , a strong meridional reﬂection was observed at 1 / 12 nm 2 1 ( Supporting Information Fig . S4 ) . In comparison with the report by Yang et al . [ 2013 ] , we observed the more orderly alignment of the cross - bridges . This is potentially attribut - able to the better quality of the ﬁlopodial tomograms Fig . 3 . CYTOSKELETON Bundling Mechanisms of F - Actin by Fascin in Filopodia 5 (cid:2) compared to that of the in vitro reconstructed F - actin and fascin bundles . This might be due to unknown accessory proteins or cooperative actin binding , such as with myosin or coﬁlin [ Ngo et al . , 2015 ] . The last consideration is the interaction between cell membranes and actin bundles . The middle regions of some ﬁlopodia were observed to be somewhat distended , as indi - cated in Fig . 1B . This may be due to the effect of washing with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and / or blotting with ﬁlter paper . In both the distended and nondistended regions shown in Fig . 1B , the presence of masses between the actin bundles and cell membranes were not observed , i . e . , no interaction between these structures was apparent . This is consistent with the mechanism of ﬁlopodial elonga - tion , whereby bundled actin ﬁlament ﬂow distends the membrane during elongation [ Mattila and Lappalainen , 2008 ] . Furthermore , interactions between actin ﬁlaments and cell membranes are not required for this process , and would likely hinder the dynamic ﬂow of actin ﬁlaments [ Aratyn et al . , 2007 ] . Structural Homogeneity in Actin Filaments and Their Alignment We analyzed the detailed structure of individual actin ﬁla - ments in ﬁlopodia . First , we examined their helical prop - erty . After the 3D volumes of actin ﬁlaments were extracted from the 3D maps of ﬁlopodia and were projected into 2D images , the 2D images were analyzed with FFT to deter - mine the helical properties of the actin ﬁlaments . To improve the signal - to - noise ratio , the power spectra were averaged ( Supporting Information Fig . S4 ) and the results indicated that the tomogram resolution was greater than (cid:2) 4 nm using the best projection angle . As a result , the aver - aged data representing the helical symmetrical properties of actin ﬁlaments in ﬁlopodia was determined to be domi - nantly 2 166 . 6 8 subunit rotation or 2 . 16 units / turn , corre - sponding to actin ﬁlament crossover lengths of approximately 36 . 8 nm . We also examined the positions of two layer lines ( Bessel order , n 5 2 and 2 1 ) of each actin ﬁlament and clariﬁed the distribution of twisting angles ( Supporting Information Fig . S2 ( inset ) ) . The tomograms of in vivo actin - fascin bundles indicate that each fascin binding actin ﬁlament has a low degree of helical ﬂexibility around 2 166 . 64 ( SD : 0 . 39 / SE : 0 . 09 ) per monomer . In comparison , it was reported that in vitro actin ﬁlaments have a helical symmetry of 2 166 . 2 8 [ Moore et al . , 1970 ] , while actin ﬁlaments embedded in thin ice have 2 166 . 6 8 [ Fujii et al . , 2010 ; Galkin et al . , 2015 ] , and the helical sym - metry of individual bundled actin ﬁlaments is 2 167 . 1 8 according to X - ray small angle scattering analysis [ Claessens et al . , 2008 ] . Thus it was found that the symmetrical struc - ture of actin ﬁlaments in ﬁlopodia is closest to thin ice embedded actin ﬁlaments . In ﬁlopodia , fascin - bundled actin ﬁlaments were found to be more orderly than in reconstructed bundles . In order to further understand the underlying mechanism , we exam - ined the alignment between individual actin ﬁlaments . Each actin ﬁlament extracted from the 3D maps of the ﬁlo - podia was compared with an atomic model of an actin ﬁla - ment ( PDB ID : 3G37 ) using speciﬁc symmetrical properties ( including 2 166 . 6 8 subunit rotation ) , as well as the rigid body ﬁtting method in real space , as shown in Supporting Information Fig . S8 . The real space analysis also showed that actin ﬁlaments conformed to a subunit rotation of 2 166 . 4 8 , which is similar to 2 166 . 6 8 ( Support - ing Information Fig . S9A ) . All these results indicate that the actin ﬁlaments in ﬁlo - podia have small twist distributions with an averaged angle of 2 166 . 6 , and , interestingly , the symmetrical properties of actin ﬁlaments in ﬁlopodia are close to recently reported observations , thereby providing high - resolution atomic models by structural homogeneity and straightness [ Fujii et al . , 2010 ; Galkin et al . , 2015 ] . Galkin et al . showed that this structural homogeneity was achieved by the large forces attributable to the thin ice layer and buffer ﬂow in their preparation , whereas a tilted and ﬂexible state of F - actin was observed in the absence of such forces when thicker ice was used . These results indicate that actin ﬁlaments in ﬁlo - podia might be exposed to external forces from surrounding actins and / or actin bundle ﬂow , and thereby exhibit Fig . 3 . Molecular mechanisms of fascin cross - linking of actin filaments . A proposed actin filament bundling model is depicted . ( A , B ) The EM averaged density maps are shown in mesh and the atomic models are shown as solid surfaces and ribbons . The structures were estimated from the atomic coordinates of an actin filament ( PDB ID : 3G37 ) and the crystallographic structure of fascin ( 3P53 ) , and were fitted to the EM map , thereby producing a structure of reasonable size and shape . The subunit rotation of the actin filament is modified from 2 166 . 2 8 ( 3G37 ) to 2 166 . 6 8 . The surface models are colored according to electrostatic charge : negative charges in red and positive charges in blue . ( A ) Front view of the cross - linking region . The bottom area disappeared after averaging because of the helical symmetry characteristics and a missing wedge following electron tomography . ( B ) Top view following rotation of ( A ) by 90 8 around the filament axis . The experimental model was somewhat flattened due to the missing wedge ; however the model was well fitted . ( C ) The actin filament bundling model focused on the double binding side . The three actin monomers and fascin are displayed with surface modeling . The important fascin residues ( R140 / K150 / R151 , K247 / K250 , and S29 / S39 ) for bun - dling to actin filaments , which have been previously proposed ( Yang et al . , 2013 ; Jansen et al . , 2011 ) , are displayed in green . ( D ) The actin filament bundling model focused on the single binding side . The key fascin residue ( K358 ) is displayed in green . At the single binding side , an actin filament connects with fascin at a single position . In ( A ) , ( C ) , and ( D ) , the direction of the minus - end of the filament is upwards . In ( B ) , the minus - end of the filament projects from the surface to the back of the image .

CYTOSKELETON properties ( straightness and robustness ) related to structural homogeneity that enable ﬁlopodial rigidity and bundling . In addition , it is well known that an actin ﬁlament is also loosely twisted as a single helix when binding the motor protein myosin , while it is tightly twisted when binding the actin ﬁlament disassembly factor coﬁlin [ McGough et al . , 1997 ; Galkin et al . , 2001 ; Sharma et al . , 2011 ; Ngo et al . , 2015 ] . Interestingly , Ngo et al . [ 2015 ] proposed a model where cooperative and mutual conformational changes are induced by coﬁlin . In ﬁlopodia , the actin ﬁlaments appeared to converge to the 2 166 . 6 8 twist structure ( Sup - porting Information Fig . S4 ) and tended to resemble the myosin - bound condition . This suggests that bundled actin ﬁlaments could be dynamically altered by fascin to facilitate myosin binding , which is important for ﬁlopodia formation and for promoting intracellular transport [ Bohil et al . , 2006 ; Tokuo et al . , 2007 ] . The position of each actin monomer in ﬁlopodia was well established , with two interesting points arising . First , it was revealed that each neighboring actin ﬁlament was shifted by (cid:2) 6 2 . 54 nm ( SE : 0 . 02 nm ) ( Supporting Infor - mation Fig . S9B ) , which mostly corresponds to the repeat length of actin monomers along the ﬁlament axis ( 2 . 73 nm ) . The difference of 1 . 9 A˚ was small and not so signiﬁcant when compared with the spatial resolutions ( (cid:2) 4 nm ) and might be due to noise or errors in single ﬁla - ment analysis ( Supporting Information Figs . S8 and S9 ) . Next , as shown in Fig . 2B as a typical view of cross - bridges , each actin ﬁlament was statistically estimated to be cross - linked at an angle of 12 . 46 8 ( SD : 3 . 61 / SE : 0 . 25 ) relative to the perpendicular plane of the ﬁlament axis . Others have observed these tilted wavy cross - linking structures as bundled actin ﬁlaments [ Sukow and DeRosier , 2003 ] . These two results are mutually consistent because 12 . 3 nm 3 tan ( 12 . 5 8 ) is (cid:2) 2 . 73 nm . Figure 2A shows a schematic model of the actin ﬁlament lattice structure , which indicates the actin ﬁlament shifts estimated from the tomogram . It was found that actin ﬁla - ments in ﬁlopodia are highly regular with respect to their longitudinal alignment and intervals . Hence , the cross - linking between adjacent actin ﬁlaments exists in two of three possible orientations , where fascin induces the 2 . 73 - nm shifts between actin ﬁlaments . In the non - cross - linked orientation , fascin is not capable of cross - linking actin due to the 5 . 46 - nm shift ( 1 2 or 2 2 ) . Bundling Mechanisms of Actin Filaments by Fascin We ﬁtted both the X - ray and EM atomic models of fascin ( 3P53 ) and actin ﬁlaments ( using an actin ﬁlament 3G37 modiﬁed to a subunit rotation of 2 166 . 6 8 ) to the averaged density map with UCSF Chimera [ Pettersen et al . , 2004 ] ( Supporting Information Fig . S6 ) . As a result , the bundling model in Fig . 3 is proposed , and demonstrates that the dis - tances between each actin ﬁlament and the cross - bridges were structurally reasonable . The combination of our pro - posed model and the previous information related to actin ﬁlament binding regions for fascin [ Yang et al . , 2013 ] led to the proposal of the following bundling mechanism . As a result of ﬁtting , actin ﬁlaments were crosslinked at 2 . 73 - nm shifts along the actin ﬁlament as expected . This allows the cleft in adjacent actin ﬁlaments to face each other ( Fig . 3A ) , and therefore two different regions of fascin bind to the cleft of individual actin ﬁlaments . It has been reported that fascin has three key regions for bundling actin ﬁlaments [ Yang et al . , 2013 ] . Comparing our proposed model with the previous report indicates that one side of fascin has two actin - binding regions ( double binding side ) and the opposite binding side has one actin - binding region ( single binding side ) . We examined the details of cross - bridges indicated in Fig . 3 and found that the double binding side of fascin ( R140 / K150 / R151 and K247 / K250 ) , suggested by Yang et al . [ 2013 ] , inserts into a cleft between the n th and ( n 1 2 ) th actin monomers . In the cleft of an actin ﬁlament , each of the two binding regions of fascin can interact with the pointed end side of subdomain - 1 of the n th monomer and the barbed end side of subdomain - 1 of the ( n 1 2 ) th monomer . Both of the binding regions of actin have nega - tively charged clusters , which correspond to two positively charged clusters in fascin . Meanwhile , the single binding region of fascin is suggested to be located at residue K358 and inserts into another cleft . The binding region of actin is near the surface of the n th barbed - end of an actin mono - mer , which has a negatively charged cluster at E99 / E100 . This cluster is known to be one of the electrostatic binding regions that interact with actin binding proteins ( APBs ) such as myosin [ Johara et al . , 1993 ; Miller and Reisler , 1995 ] . On the double binding side , one actin ﬁlament and fascin molecule bind rigidly at two widely positioned sites , while weak , ﬂexible binding at a narrow region occurs at the single binding side . Hence , we propose a model of the mechanism for actin ﬁlament bundle growth in ﬁlopodia in Fig . 4 . The model is based on the assumption that the double binding side of fascin should be preferentially and tightly bound to an actin ﬁlament ( Step 1 in Fig . 4 ) . Fascin bind - ing will reduce the mobility of actin ﬁlaments and enhance the ability to anchor actin at the single binding side . Figure 2C shows that fascin - like projections regularly bind to the edge actin ﬁlaments of actin bundles with 36 - nm intervals . Cooperative binding properties have been reported for myosin [ Siddique et al . , 2005 ] , although the mechanisms were unknown . At the single binding side , an actin ﬁlament and fascin bind ﬂexibly at a single point . This process could be important for maintaining the dynamics of fascin and its rapid binding ability [ Aratyn et al . , 2007 ] . In addition , according to the subunit rotation of 2 166 . 6 8 , similar to 2 166 . 7 8 ( true pitch : 147 nm , selection rule : 54 / 25 ) for CYTOSKELETON Bundling Mechanisms of F - Actin by Fascin in Filopodia 7 (cid:2) actin ﬁlaments ( Supporting Information Fig . S10 ) but dif - ferent from 2 166 . 2 8 ( true pitch : 35 . 5 nm , selection rule : 13 / 6 ) , it is difﬁcult for fascin to cross - link actin ﬁlaments in parallel over the entire ﬁlament in the same binding man - ner , and the torsion induced by the different binding mech - anisms could be absorbed by a single ﬂexible binding site that potentially functions as a hinge because the single elec - trostatic interaction is not directional . In the other words , the ﬂexible binding angle at the single binding site allows the absorption of structural stress throughout the entire ﬁlopodial actin bundle . Since rigidity and ﬂexibility are important for ﬁlopodial dynamism , the two types of bind - ing shown in Fig . 4 could play key roles in the underlying molecular mechanism . Short actin ﬁlaments were observed in the tomograms of ﬁlopodia ( Fig . 2B ) , in which actin bundles would be grow - ing in thickness at their periphery with the ﬁlaments extending in their barbed - end direction . From the observa - tions indicated in Figs . 2B and 2C as a typical view , we pro - pose a schematic model of actin ﬁlament growth in ﬁlopodia where short actin ﬁlaments are recruited to a sta - ble , bundled actin ﬁlament . First , many fascin molecules bind to a scaffold actin ﬁlament in a bundle on the double binding side . Next , a short actin ﬁlament is recruited to a peripheral actin ﬁlament and is anchored with a single binding site . Last , an additional cross - link is formed between an adjacent actin ﬁlament and a short actin ﬁla - ment . The actin ﬁlament bundle becomes thicker by means of this process . This mechanism is suitable for dynamic bundle formation and breakage , which is necessary for ﬁlo - podial protrusion and retraction . Here , we unveiled the architecture of bundled actin ﬁla - ments in ﬁlopodia and proposed a bundling model . The architecture is different from that in reconstructed bundles of actin and fascin . Thus , it is important to elucidate the binding regions of actin ﬁlaments and fascin at atomic reso - lutions in ﬁlopodia . Since the difﬁculty of performing cryo - ET on ﬁlopodia is due to the dynamics of fascin and actin ﬁlament structures , we must obtain many tomograms with higher signal - to - noise ratios while avoiding image blur at low doses . New technologies such as direct detector devices and motion collection methods will be helpful in revealing the molecular architecture of actin ﬁlaments bound to fas - cin at atomic resolutions . Conclusion In this study , we revealed the molecular architecture of ﬁlo - podia with cryo - ET and image processing techniques . In ﬁlopodia , actin ﬁlaments were bundled hexagonally by cross - bridges ( identiﬁed as fascin ) in two of three possible planes and were regularly shifted by 2 . 7 nm corresponding to the interval of monomers . We identiﬁed the helical sym - metry and alignment of each ﬁlament and produced a bun - dling model by comparing the experimental EM map and atomic models described in previous reports . The architec - ture in ﬁlopodia is slightly different from that of recon - structed bundles and less ﬂexible . From our bundling model , we suggested that two different types of binding enable the dynamic , ﬂexible , and rigid properties of bundled actin ﬁlaments and proposed a bundle growth model from our observations . These processes are critical for the dynamics , ﬂexibility , and rigidity of ﬁlopodia . Experimental Procedures Neuronal Cells and Cell Culture NG108 - 15 cells , a somatic cell hybrid of mouse N18TG2 neuroblastoma and rat C6 - BU - 1 glioma cells , were used as a neuronal model cell . The cells were grown in DMEM medium ( Wako ) with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( HyClone ) , 0 . 2 mM L - glutamine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , and penicillin – strep - tomycin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) at 37 8 C in 5 % CO 2 . Grid Preparation QUANTIFOIL ( R0 . 6 / 1 , Au ) Holey Carbon Film grids were used for cryo - EM because gold mesh substrates were suitable for cell culture . The grids were coated with poly - L - lysine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 30 min to charge the surface of the carbon ﬁlm and enhance the absorption of colloidal gold particles onto the carbon ﬁlm . After applying 10 nm gold colloidal markers ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 10 min , the solution was removed from the grids with ﬁlter paper and Fig . 4 . Growth model of actin filament bundles . This schematic model corresponds to the area indicated by the broken cyan line in Fig . 2 . Fascin is illustrated as a wedge . The thick ends of the wedges indicate the double binding side , whereas the thin ends indicate the actin binding side . The proposed growth mechanism of bundled actin filaments is as follows . First ( Step 1 ) , the double binding side of fascin binds to a scaffold actin filament located on the bundle surface , indicated by a red wedge . Next ( Step 2 ) , a short actin filament is recruited to the single binding side of the fascin and anchored . Last ( Step 3 ) , the short actin filament is cross - linked to the adjacent scaffold actin .

CYTOSKELETON the grids were coated with a 10 - to 20 - nm - thick layer of carbon for ﬁne tracking and reconstruction . Sample Preparation for Cryo - EM The preprepared cryo - grids were coated with poly - L - lysine for 30 min again and with laminin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 60 min to enhance cellular adhesion . Then neuronal cells were cultured directly on the grids for 24 hours under the condi - tions described above . After the removal of the culture media , the cultured cells were plunge - frozen in liquid eth - ane cooled by liquid nitrogen with a custom - built quick freezing apparatus . Acquiring Tilt - Series with Cryo - EM Plunge - frozen cultured cells were transferred to a transmis - sion electron microscope ( Tecnai G 2 Polara , FEI Com - pany ) , operated at 200 kV with a Schottky - type ﬁeld emission gun . Tilt series were acquired with a 2048 3 2048 CCD camera ( Ultra Scan Camera and GIF post col - umn energy ﬁlter with 20 eV slit , Gatan ) . The images were taken from 2 60 8 to 1 60 8 with 1 2 8 increments at a direct magniﬁcation of 50 , 000 3 . The pixel size of the tilt series was 4 . 43 A˚ / pix . The defocusing values were approximately 10 m m to obtain sufﬁcient contrast . The total dose for specimens was less than 100 e - / A˚ . Image Processing and Exploration of the Filopodia The CTF of acquired tilt - series images were determined by manual ﬁtting and corrected by phase - ﬂipping with Eos [ Yasunaga and Wakabayashi , 1996 ] . 3D maps were recon - structed with eTomo of IMOD [ Kremer et al . , 1996 ] using the SIRT algorithm with 50 iterations . After 3D maps were ﬁltered using a nonlocal means ﬁlter to reduce noise , and binning to twice the original pixel size , auto - segmentation analyses of actin ﬁlaments were performed using Amira ( FEI Company ) and a ﬁlamentous structure autoidentifying package [ Rigort et al . , 2012 ] . Quantitative analyses of actin ﬁlaments and fascin were performed using Eos , IMOD , UCSF Chimera [ Pettersen et al . , 2004 ] , and Fiji [ Schinde - lin et al . , 2012 ] . Single actin ﬁlament analysis , using Nari - ta’s method [ Narita and Maeda , 2007 ] with modiﬁcation , was performed as follows . The extracted actin ﬁlaments were fragmented to 100 pix . ( (cid:3) 45 nm ) of short actin ﬁla - ments and were calculated using a cross - correlation func - tion with a model map from PDB ( 3G37 ) , then the position and rotation angles of each ﬁlament were deter - mined with Eos . The Fourier transform of actin ﬁlaments was averaged from that of each extracted actin ﬁlament , which was 453 nm ( 1024 pix . ) in length . To clarify the structure of fascin , the averaged map was calculated follow - ing the determination of the positions and angles . The rigid - body reﬁnement of actin ﬁlaments and fascin was then performed with the correlation method of Chimera , using 20 - nm resolution maps of ﬁlamentous actin ( gener - ated from 3G37 ) and fascin ( generated from 3P53 ) . The electrostatic charges were displayed with Coulombic Surface Coloring with Chimera . The distance and angles between molecules in 2D and 3D were analyzed with Fiji and Chi - mera / 3dmod , respectively . The 3D maps and models were visualized with Chimera and the 3dmod of IMOD .
