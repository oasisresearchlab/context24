The ERK - MAPK ( extracellular signal - regulated kinase - mitogen - acti - vated protein kinase ) localizes to protrusions and adhesions , but how it regulates motility is not understood . We demonstrate that ERK controls protrusion initiation and protrusion speed . Lamelli - podial protrusions are generated via the WRC ( WAVE2 regulatory complex ) , which activates the Arp2 / 3 actin nucleator for actin assembly . The WRC must be phosphorylated to be activated , but the sites and kinases that regulate its intermolecular changes and membrane recruitment are unknown . We show that ERK colocalizes with the WRC at lamellipodial leading edges and directly phosphory - lates two WRC components : WAVE2 and Abi1 . The phosphorylations are required for functional WRC interaction with Arp2 / 3 and actin during cell protru - sion . Thus , ERK coordinates adhesion disassembly with WRC activation and actin polymerization to promote productive leading edge advancement during cell migration . INTRODUCTION Cells move via cycles of leading edge protrusion and adhesion to the ECM ( extracellular matrix ) , cell body translocation , and posterior retraction . The Arp2 / 3 complex drives leading edge protrusion by nucleating actin monomers to assemble a dense meshwork of short branched ﬁlaments called the lamellipodium ( Insall and Machesky , 2009 ; Pollard and Cooper , 2009 ) . As the lamellipodium protrudes , small dynamic nascent adhesions continuously form within the branched actin network ( Choi et al . , 2008 ) . These adhesions are multiprotein complexes that include Paxillin and FAK , which regulate ECM coupling to actin ( Vicente - Manzanares et al . , 2009 ) . A looser network of long unbranched actin ﬁlaments , the lamella , abuts the lamellipodium ( Ponti et al . , 2004 ) . At the lamellipodium / lamella interface , older adhesions either disassemble or mature into larger , elongated adhesions that provide traction force ( Choi et al . , 2008 ) . Myosin II , which can be activated by myosin light - chain kinase ( MLCK ) , couples to older adhesions and aids their maturation . Myosin II also functions in mature adhe - sions to regulate lamella retraction and in the cell cortex to regulate cell body translocation ( Vicente - Manzanares et al . , 2009 ) . In order to achieve productive forward movement , protrusions must form and adhesions assemble and disas - semble , and the cell body must move in a very synchronized manner . Along these lines , the rates of nascent adhesion turn - over and lamellipodium advancement have been found to directly correlate ( Choi et al . , 2008 ) . How the cytoskeleton and adhesion machinery are regulated in order to achieve such coordination is just beginning to be understood . In the lamellipodium , Arp2 / 3 activity is triggered by its binding to the VCA ( verprolin homology , coﬁlin homology , and acidic ) region of WAVE2 ( WASp and verprolin homologous protein 2 ) . WAVE2 functions in a stable WRC that contains HSPC300 , Abi ( Abl - interactor ) 1 or 2 , Nap1 ( NCK - associated protein ) , and Sra - 1 ( speciﬁcally Rac1 - associ - ated protein ) ( Insall and Machesky , 2009 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . These WRC components are required for each other’s stability and leading edge localization ( Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . Advances in purifying and assaying the WRC have led to the conclusion that it is inactive toward Arp2 / 3 , until phospholipids bind WAVE2 and the activated form of Rac ( Rac - GTP ) binds Sra - 1 ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Ismail et al . , 2009 ; Lebensohn and Kirschner , 2009 ) . These regulators recruit and cluster the WRC at the plasma membrane ( Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ) . A recent WAVE1 - containing WRC crystal structure revealed that Rac - GTP binding additionally allosteri - cally activates the WRC by inducing a conformational change that releases intermolecular VCA sequestration ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) . WRC phosphorylation is also required for activation ( Chen et al . , 2010 ; Lebensohn and Kirschner , 2009 ) . Abl phos - phorylation of WAVE2 Tyr150 participates in WRC activation by destabilizing the inhibited WRC conformation and releasing the VCA domain ( Chen et al . , 2010 ; Leng et al . , 2005 ; Stuart et al . , 2006 ) . The involvement of other phosphorylations is likely , but Molecular Cell 41 , 661 – 671 , March 18 , 2011 ª 2011 Elsevier Inc . 661 the phosphorylation sites and their activating kinases are unknown ( Lebensohn and Kirschner , 2009 ) . The ERK - MAPK pathway is one of the principal signaling cascades by which cells respond to extracellular and intracel - lular cues . Growth factors activate ERK - MAPK by signaling through their cognate receptors at the cell surface to the small GTPase Ras . Ras recruits the MAP kinase kinase kinase Raf , which phosphorylates and activates the MAP kinase kinase MEK , which then phosphorylates and activates ERK ( McKay and Morrison , 2007 ; Pullikuth and Catling , 2007 ) . Depending on the cell type and stimulus , Ras can also activate PI3K ( phos - phatidylinositol 3 - kinase ) , which functions with its downstream effector kinase Akt to regulate migration speed and directionality ( Ko¨lsch et al . , 2008 ) . ERK activity can also be induced via ECM signaling during adhesion . In this pathway , the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 activate PAK ( p21 - activated kinase ) , which phosphorylates MEK to make it a more efﬁcient Raf substrate ( Coles and Shaw , 2002 ; Eblen et al . , 2002 ; Slack - Davis et al . , 2003 ) . ERK signaling is required for cell motility in diverse systems , yet its chief function during motility is unknown . ERK regulates the disassembly of older adhesions via its phosphorylation and activation of FAK ( focal adhesion kinase ) , Paxillin , and MLCK ( Ishibe et al . , 2003 ; Klemke et al . , 1997 ; Liu et al . , 2002 ; Vomastek et al . , 2007 ; Webb et al . , 2004 ) . ERK has also been found to be required for membrane rufﬂing and extension ( Brahmbhatt and Klemke , 2003 ; Scott et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , we hypothesized ERK Figure 1 .

We found ERK speciﬁcally regulates protrusion initiation and protrusion and migration speed . ERK colocalizes with and directly phos - phorylates the WRC on WAVE2 and Abi1 . These phosphorylations promote functional WRC binding to Arp2 / 3 and actin and are required for lamellipodial protrusion . Thus , ERK regulates WRC activation to promote actin polymerization for rapid edge advancement during cell motility . RESULTS ERK Regulates Lamellipodial Protrusion We determined if ERK activity was required for EGF ( epidermal growth factor ) - stimulated protrusion in normal HMECs ( human mammary epithelial cells ) using time - lapse microscopy . In HMECs , EGF is a strong activator of the ERK - MAPK pathway and a weak activator of PI3K , as assessed by phospho - ERK and phospho - Akt levels ( Figure 1A ) . We manually quantiﬁed the EGF - induced change in HMEC cell surface area as a read - out of cell protrusion and retraction . Unmodiﬁed HMECs exhibited minimal protrusive activity ( Figure 1B , V ) . Because the small GTPase Rac is required for lamellipodial protrusion ( Heasman and Ridley , 2008 ) , we stably infected and selected the HMECs with virus - expressing Puromycin R and constitutively active Rac mutant Q61L . Rac Q61L expression did not affect the levels of active ERK ( phospho - ERK ) , excluding Rac regulation of ERK via the PAK - MEK pathway ( Figure 1A ) . EGF induced a protrusion and retraction cycle in HMEC / Rac Q61L cells that closely mimicked the published dynamics of murine mammary adeno - carcinoma cells ( Figures 1A and 1B ) ( Segall et al . , 1996 ) . Pretreatment of HMEC / Rac Q61L cells with a MEK inhibitor ( U0126 ) completely abrogated their protrusion ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . Thus , ERK activity is required for cell protrusion . Molecular Cell ERK Drives Protrusion via WRC Phosphorylation 662 Molecular Cell 41 , 661 – 671 , March 18 , 2011 ª 2011 Elsevier Inc . We further dissected ERK’s role in protrusion by quantifying the effects of ERK inhibition on the exploratory dynamics of growing PtK 1 cells ( Machacek and Danuser , 2006 ) . We used GFP as a cytoplasmic marker and edge tracking software to calculate the percentage and speed of protrusion and retraction . U0126 pretreatment abrogated protrusion and caused the cell edges to exhibit overall retraction throughout a 10 min time lapse ( Figure 1D ) . At any given time , 44 % of control - treated PtK 1 cell edges were protruding , while only 7 % of the U0126 - treated membranes protruded . Strikingly , the remaining protrusions in MEK - inhibited cells exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced instanta - neous protrusion velocity ( 7 . 8 ± 0 . 8 nm / s for control cells versus 2 . 2 ± 0 . 4 nm / s for U0126 - reated cells , means and SEM for ﬁve cells , p = 0 . 0003 ) . In contrast , retraction velocity was not greatly affected ( 5 . 5 ± 2 . 3 nm / s for control and 6 . 2 ± 2 . 4 nm / s for U0126 , means and SEM for ﬁve cells , p = 0 . 7 ) . Thus , though ERK inhibi - tion results in overall retraction , this is due to downregulation of protrusive activity rather than an increase in contractility . We hypothesized ERK might signal through the Arp2 / 3 machinery to promote protrusion . We ﬁrst determined if ERK promotes cell protrusion by augmenting ERK activity in HMECs . Cells expressing hyperactive B - Raf V600E or overexpressing the EGFR ( EGF receptor ) exhibited enhanced EGF - stimulated cell protrusion , similar to constitutively active Rac Q61L ( Figures S1A and S1B ) . We used these cells to address the requirement for Rac and the WRC in ERK - driven protrusions . In both HMEC / B - Raf V600E and HMEC / EGFR cells , dominant - negative Rac T17N blocked EGF - stimulated protrusion without affecting phospho - ERK levels , although Rac T17N did reduce EGFR expression ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . When we reduced the levels of individual Figure 2 .

WRC components with pooled or indi - vidual siRNAs , the abundance of the other WRC complex members was also reduced ( Figures 2C and S2A ) , likely via proteasomal degradation ( Kunda et al . , 2003 ) . Loss of these WRC components blocked HMEC / EGFR protrusion similarly to reduction of ERK ( Figure 2D ) . We also repeated the experiment with Alexa 555 - labeled siRNA and analyzed only the Alexa 555 - labeled transfected subpopu - lation ( Figures S2B and S2C ) . Again , loss of WRC components signiﬁcantly inhibited protrusion . Thus , we conclude these WRC subunits are required for ERK - driven protrusion in the HMEC system . ERK Colocalizes with and Directly Phosphorylates the WRC We hypothesized that molecular cooperation between ERK and the WRC would require them to be in the same place at the same time during lamellipodial protrusion . We assessed their localiza - tion in HMEC / EGFR cells 2 . 5 min after EGF stimulation , when the protrusions are still growing . At this time point , HMECs retained large amounts of cortical actin and exhibited small areas of rufﬂed edges and cytoplasmic pERK . Of 25 randomly selected cells , 19 ( 76 % ) exhibited peaks in the intensity of WAVE2 stain at the edge , suggesting these cells had responded to the EGF and translocated WAVE2 to the membrane . Four of these 19 protruding cells ( 21 % ) exhibited pERK staining preferentially at the cell edge ( Figures 3A , S3A , and S3B ) . While these results are not surprising , given that ERK regulates many disparate biological processes in different subcellular locales ( McKay and Morrison , 2007 ; Shaul and Seger , 2007 ) , we aimed to conﬁrm any WAVE2 and pERK colocalization during protrusion in a system with less heterogeneity . We thus analyzed pERK and WAVE2 localization in Cos - 7 cells , which exhibit a more uniform protrusion response to EGF : large lamellipodia with WAVE2 localized to the edge and minimal cortical actin ( Fig - ure 3B ) ( 25 / 25 randomly selected cells ) . Measuring the intensity of each stain with respect to distance from the cell edge veriﬁed that both WAVE2 and phospho - ERK intensities peaked at the Molecular Cell ERK Drives Protrusion via WRC Phosphorylation Molecular Cell 41 , 661 – 671 , March 18 , 2011 ª 2011 Elsevier Inc . 663 edge and decreased coincidently with the actin intensity peak ( Figures 3B and S3B ) ( 24 / 25 cells ) . pERK intensity then increased further inside the cell , consistent with active ERK localization to the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments ( Figures 3B , S3A , and S3B ) ( McKay and Morrison , 2007 ) . We assessed the colocalization of WAVE2 and phospho - ERK via an object - based colocalization method ( Lachmanovich et al . , 2003 ) . We calculated the probability of ﬁnding WAVE2stain punctae within 0 . 2 m m ( the resolution of diffraction - limited microscopy ) of any given pERK stain puncta . This probability was25 % ( ±3 % SEM ) higherthanarandomdistributionofequally dense points for HMECs and 28 % ( ± 4 % SEM ) higher for Cos - 7 cells , indicating they are signiﬁcantly closer together than would occur by chance . The relative probabilities of the distance between pERK and WAVE2 decreased to 1 ( equal to that of chance ) and then to less than 1 ( less likely than chance ) at further distances ( Figure3C ) . Thus , WAVE2andpERKindeedcolocalize . In both systems , ERK inhibition caused a restructuring of actin into stress ﬁbers and large punctate structures reminiscent of adhesions ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . However , ERK inhibition did not impact WAVE2 localization to the cell edge . Six of 10 HMECs and 9 of 10 randomly selected Cos - 7 cells pretreated with U0126 exhibited peaks in WAVE2 intensity at the cell edge ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . We further conﬁrmed that ERK localizes to the edge of lamellipodial protrusions by costaining with Paxillin , a compo - nent of lamellipodial nascent adhesions . Phospho - ERK stain overlapped with lamellipodial nascent adhesions and also large mature adhesions , consistent with previous studies ( Fincham et al . , 2000 ; Ishibe et al . , 2003 ; Vomastek et al . , 2007 ) ( Figures 3D and S3C ) . Inhibition or loss of ERK or WAVE2 caused indistin - guishable cellular phenotypes : The edges lacked any sign of protrusion and were instead surrounded by large adhesions ( Figures 3D and S3C ) . We hypothesized ERK cooperates with the WRC in cell protru - sion by regulating WRC activation . ERK has been suggested to both phosphorylate ( Danson et al . , 2007 ) and not phosphorylate ( Lebensohn and Kirschner , 2009 ) WAVE2 . We tested whether ERK phosphorylates the WRC by in vivo labeling and in vitro kinase assay . When the WRC was immunoprecipitated from 32 P - labeled , EGF - stimulated HMEC / EGFR cells , ERK - depen - dent phosphorylation was detected on WAVE2 and Abi1 , but not Nap1 or Sra - 1 ( Figure 4A ) . In vitro , GST - ERK2 phosphory - lated WAVE2 in the WRC , but not uncomplexed WAVE2 ( Fig - ure 4B ) . Further , ERK2 phosphorylation of WAVE2 and Abi1 increased with increasing amounts of Nap1 / Sra - 1 in the WRC substrate ( Figure 4C ) . In order to identify the sites that ERK phosphorylates on WAVE2 and Abi1 , we used mass spectrometry to analyze endogenous WRC puriﬁed from EGF - stimulated HMEC / EGFR cells and in vitro - phosphorylated WRC puriﬁed from 293F cells ( Figures S4A and S4B ) . ERK interacts with its scaffolds and substrates via ERK’s CD ( common docking ) and / or DBP ( DEF motif binding pocket ) binding to D domains and DEF motifs within the interacting protein ( Dimitri et al . , 2005 ; Lee et al . , 2004 ) .

Molecular Cell ERK Drives Protrusion via WRC Phosphorylation 664 Molecular Cell 41 , 661 – 671 , March 18 , 2011 ª 2011 Elsevier Inc . We used ERK2 mutants that cannot bind D ( D319N ) domains or DEF ( Y261A ) motifs as negative controls for the in vitro - phos - phorylated WRC mass spectrometry analysis , as they exhibited minimal phosphorylation of the WRC ( Figure 4D ) . We counted the number of times the spectra for each site are observed in the different ERK2 samples , as it is suggestive of their relative abundance . S308 , S343 , T346 , and S351 were previously inferred to be ERK phosphorylation sites , as their point mutation abrogates growth factor - induced WAVE2 phosphorylation and band shift ( Danson et al . , 2007 ; Nakanishi et al . , 2007 ) . S482 and S484 were also originally reported to be ERK sites ( Nakanishi et al . , 2007 ) , but have since been shown to be phosphorylated by Casein Kinase 2 , not ERK2 ( Pocha and Cory , 2009 ) . S482 and S484 are followed by aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues , creating motifs selected against by ERK2 and preferred by Casein Kinase 2 ( Hutti et al . , 2004 ) . Our mass spectrometry anal - ysis identiﬁed pS296 in both the wild - type ( WT ) and D319N ERK2 samples . We found WAVE2 pS308 only in the WT ERK2 sample ( Figure S5 and Table S1 ) . This suggests that WAVE2 S296 and S308 are phosphorylated in an ERK - dependent manner . S343 , T346 , and S351 have not been reported in any mass spectrom - etry analysis , likely because they reside in a poly - proline - rich region refractory to tryptic and chymotryptic digestion . We made antibodies to phospho - S308 , - S343 , - T346 , and - S351 and conﬁrmed they speciﬁcally detected their respective sites using alanine mutants as controls ( Figure 5A ) . We used these antibodies to test whether ERK regulated phosphorylation of these sites in vivo . In HMECs , each site exhibited U0126 - sensi - tive phosphorylation with EGF stimulation ( Figure 5B ) . Cos - 7 cells exhibited ERK - dependent phosphorylation of S343 , T346 , and S351 , but not S308 . The S308 , T346 , and S351 sites exhibited relatively high basal phosphorylation , suggesting that residual ERK activity or a different proline - directed kinase main - tains their phosphorylation in the starved state . In Cos - 7 cells , mutation of the three common WAVE2 sites to alanine residues ( 3A ) abrogated EGF - induced U0126 - sensitive in vivo labeling , although total basal phosphorylation remained high ( Figure S4C ) . Mutation of S482 and S484 to alanine did not affect EGF - induci - ble U0126 - sensitive phosphorylation . Thus , pS343 , pT346 , and pS351 account for the majority of ERK - induced phosphate transfer to WAVE2 . Our mass spectrometry also identiﬁed Abi1 S183 and S225 on Abi1 ( numbering corresponds to Abi1 isoform 1 ) as sites phos - phorylated on endogenous protein and in the WT , ERK - depen - dent , in vitro - phosphorylated sample ( Figure S6 and Table S1 ) . pS216 was also a suspected , although not deﬁnitive , site ( data not shown ) . These sites were not found in the ERK2 CD or DBP mutant samples . Interestingly , 5 additional Abi1 residues are predicted ERK - phosphosites ( T265 , S267 , S392 , T394 , and S410 ) ( Obenauer et al . , 2003 ) . These additional sites also lie in regions refractory to tryptic and chymotryptic digests . S392 or T394 and S410 were recently identiﬁed using Asp - N digestions ( Lebensohn and Kirschner , 2009 ; Marc Kirshner and Ross Tomaino , personal communication ) . We mutated each of these sites individually and assayed their contribution to the in vitro ERK phosphorylation of GST - Abi1 . Although no one site contrib - uted signiﬁcantly to the overall ERK phosphorylation of Abi1 , mutation of some sites did induce a mobility shift in the Abi1 protein that is consistent with reduced phosphorylation ( S216A , T265A , and T394A ) ( Figure 5C ) . We combined mutation of the three sites identiﬁed by our mass spectrometry with muta - tion of T265 and S410 , a site identiﬁed in previous mass spec - trometry experiments of the WRC ( Lebensohn and Kirschner , Figure 4 .

ERK phosphorylation of this 5A mutant was reduced , but not abolished ( Figure 5C ) . When the remaining three Scansite - predicted sites were additionally mutated , the Abi1 8A mutant exhibited only residual ( 0 . 2 % of WT ) phosphorylation by ERK2 ( Figure 5C ) . To further validate that this sheer number of sites were truly phosphorylated by ERK , we expressed and immuno - precipitated the 5A and 8A mutants from 32 P - labeled Cos - 7 cells ( Figure 5D ) . While the 5A retained EGF - inducible U0126 - sensi - tive phosphate transfer , basal and EGF - induced phosphoryla - tion of the 8A mutant were abolished . We made antibodies to phospho - S225 and conﬁrmed its recognition of WT but not alanine - mutated Abi1 ( Figure 5E ) . The antibody also detected U0126 - sensitive phosphorylation of endogenous Abi1 in both HMECs and Cos - 7 cells ( Figure 5F ) . ERK Phosphorylation of the WRC Regulates Interaction with Arp2 / 3 and Lamellipodial Protrusion We sought to understand how ERK phosphorylation of WAVE2 and Abi1 might regulate Arp2 / 3 activity and cell protrusion . Our immunoﬂuorescence data indicate ERK does not regulate WRC activation by controlling its localization to the membrane Figure 5 .

( F ) Immunoblot of endogenous Abi1 protein following EGF stimulation ± pretreatment with U0126 . ( Figure 3 ) . We therefore hypothesized that ERK promotes WRC activation by regulating its allosteric activation . All the ERK phosphorylation sites on WAVE2 and Abi1 reside within their respective proline - rich domains ( PRDs ) , unstruc - tured domains that were genetically deleted in the WRC crystal structure ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) . Phosphorylation of the PRDs would disrupt their interaction with SH3 and PLP binding domains , potentially altering WRC activation . We asked whether ERK phosphoryla - tion of WAVE2 and Abi1 could regulate WRC interaction with Arp2 / 3 or actin . We immunoprecipitated the WRC from 293T cells and found that EGF induced an ERK - dependent increase in Arp2 / 3 and actin coimmunoprecipitation ( Figure 6A ) . Consistent with these data , mutating all four WAVE2 and eight Abi1 sites to phospho - mimetic Asp / Glu residues ( WRC - D / E ) increased Arp3 and actin coimmunoprecipitation in the starved state above that seen with WT WRC under EGF stimulation ( Fig - ure 6B ) . The increased WRC - D / E interaction with Arp2 / 3 and actin was not further induced with EGF stimulation . These data suggest EGF - induced ERK phosphorylation of the WRC promotes WRC interaction with Arp2 / 3 and actin . Somewhat surprisingly , though , mutation of the sites to alanines ( WRC - A ) also increased basal WRC coimmunoprecipitation with Arp3 and actin , though not to extent of the phospho - mimetic muta - tions . We then dissected which phosphorylation sites contribute to the basal and regulated WRC interaction with Arp2 / 3 and actin by assaying the individual WAVE2 and Abi1 phospho - site mutants . Mutation of the WAVE2 sites alone induced unregu - lated WRC interaction with Arp2 / 3 and actin similar to that of WRC - A ( Figure 6C ) . In contrast , mutation of the Abi1 sites reduced both basal and EGF - stimulated WRC interaction with Arp3 and actin . Molecular Cell ERK Drives Protrusion via WRC Phosphorylation 666 Molecular Cell 41 , 661 – 671 , March 18 , 2011 ª 2011 Elsevier Inc . These data indicate ERK phosphorylation of Abi1 is required for basal and EGF - induced WRC interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex . In addition , the basal phosphorylation of WAVE2 found in the starved U0126 - treated states might be required for a conformation that permits a regulated release of Arp3 and actin . We hypothesized the dephosphorylated WRC - A might function as a dominant negative by forming a more stable and unregulatable interaction with Arp2 / 3 , thereby preventing WRC and Arp2 / 3 cycling on and off of the expanding lamellipodial actin meshwork . In contrast , hyperphosphorylated mimic WRC - D might cycle through binding and releasing Arp2 / 3 and actin faster than hypophosphorylated WRC , producing more productive Arp2 / 3 activation and actin polymerization . To test this , we puriﬁed WT and mutant WRC from log - phase mammalian 293F cells , permitting the complexes to acquire acti - vating phosphorylations found in steady - state cells ( Lebensohn and Kirschner , 2009 ) . The puriﬁed WT WAVE2 and Abi1 con - sisted of mixed populations of phospho - proteins ( Figure 6D ) . In contrast , the WRC - A ( four WAVE2 and eight Abi1 sites mutated to alanines ) and WRC - D / E ( four WAVE2 and eight Abi1 sites mutated to phospho - mimetic Asp / Glu residues ) complexes formed sharp bands of unphosphorylated or phospho - mimetic protein , respectively . WAVE2 concentration is 30 – 50 nM in WT cells ( Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ) , and we microinjected a volume of 200 nM WRC that roughly equaled 30 % of HMEC / EGFR cyto - plasmic volume for a ﬁnal concentration of (cid:1) 67 nM puriﬁed WRC . Cells microinjected with buffer or WT WRC exhibited EGF - stimulated lamellipodium protrusion that did not retract within the 15 min time course ( Figure 6E ) . Strikingly , the cells injected with WRC - A did not protrude . This suggests that while the WRC - A protein can bind Arp2 / 3 and actin , it functions as a dominant negative by inhibiting proper Arp2 / 3 activity and actin polymerization cycles . In contrast , the cells injected with WRC - D / E exhibited more extensive protrusion ( Figure 6E ) , sug - gesting the increased Arp3 and actin binding observed with the phospho - mimetic mutations hyperactivated WRC activation of Arp2 / 3 and actin polymerization . We further assayed the function of ERK phosphorylation of the WRC in Cos - 7 cell migration , which involves cell polarization , edge protrusion and adhesion , and cell body translocation . Depending on the cell type , an increase in instantaneous protru - sion may lead to an increase in migration speed . However , excessive protrusion will slow down motility , as the protrusive forces overcome the cells’ ability to contract and move the cell body ( Ji et al . , 2008 ) . Under growing conditions , Cos - 7 cells move with an average speed of 0 . 26 ± 0 . 02 m m / min ( means and SD for 30 cells over 10 hr ) . Inhibition of ERK with U0126 reduces migration speed ( 0 . 17 ± 0 . 01 m m / min , p = 0 . 0004 ) . We simultaneously reduced endogenous WAVE2 and Abi1 levels with Alexa 555 - labeled siRNA and rescued their expression with the WT and point mutant combinations by cotransfection ( Figure S7A ) . WT WAVE2 and Abi1 rescued the reduction in Figure 6 .

As expected , cotransfection of WAVE2 3A and Abi1 8A failed to rescue , while WAVE2 3D and Abi 8D increased migration speed above that of WT . Interestingly , WAVE2 3A and 3D also rescue cell motility , indicating that in the context of WT Abi1 and residual WT WAVE2 , WAVE2 phospho - site mutants do not impact cell polarization , protrusion , adhesion , and cell body translocation . In contrast , expression of Abi1 8A does not rescue migration , while Abi1 8D increases migration speed ( Figure S7B ) . Thus , ERK phosphorylation of Abi1 is essential for functional WRC during cell motility . DISCUSSION We have found that a key function of ERK during cell motility is to regulate protrusion initiation and speed . Active ERK localizes to the leading edge of protruding lamellipodia and phosphorylates the WRC on multiple sites within the PRDs of WAVE2 and Abi1 . We propose that , cumulatively , these phosphorylations contribute to the Rac - induced WRC conformational change that exposes the VCA domain , leading to WRC binding and activation of Arp2 / 3 during lamellipodial protrusion ( Chen et al . , 2010 ; Ismail et al . , 2009 ; Lebensohn and Kirschner , 2009 ) . ERK Phosphorylation of the WRC The detection of ERK phosphorylation of WAVE2 and Abi1 by in vivo labeling suggested the presence of either a very efﬁcient ERK site or multiple weaker sites . Yet the sheer number of ERK sites identiﬁed on WAVE2 and Abi1 was surprising . ERK CD - WRC D domain and ERK DBP - WRC DEF motif interactions appear to assist ERK in interacting with the complex to phos - phorylate so many sites . Interestingly , WAVE2 contains putative D and DEF domains , but Abi1 lacks any potential ERK interaction domains ( Scansite [ Obenauer et al . , 2003 ] ) . Thus , ERK is likely recruited to Abi1 via interaction domains elsewhere in the complex , potentially via Nap1 and Sra - 1 , which harbor several putative ERK interaction domains ( Scansite [ Obenauer et al . , 2003 ] ) . Consistent with this model , Nap1 / Sra - 1 augmented ERK phosphorylation of WAVE2 and Abi1 . It is somewhat confounding that a recent study concluded ERK was not the kinase responsible for phosphorylating several of the phospho - sites we identiﬁed on WAVE2 and Abi1 ( Lebensohn and Kirschner , 2009 ) . This conclusion was based upon the ﬁnding that WRCs puriﬁed from starved or EGF - stimu - lated A431 cells exhibited equivalent in vitro actin polymerization activity . While it is possible that not all of our identiﬁed Abi1 sites are phosphorylated at the same time in vivo , we suggest that in cell systems with extremely high EGFR levels , such as A431 cells , high basal ERK activity will maintain WRC phosphorylation during starvation . Along these lines , the mass spectrometry in the A431 study identiﬁed WAVE2 S308 and Abi1 S183 , S216 , S225 , S392 , and S410 phosphorylated equally in the starved and stimulated situations . In contrast , we found many of these sites to be phosphorylated in an EGF - dependent manner in vitro and in vivo . In another study , Danson et al . concluded that S343 is a substrate for JNK - MAPK , not ERK , and that T346 is a target of both kinases . This conclusion was based on an in vitro kinase assay in which ERK was unable to phos - phorylate FLAG - WAVE2 . In our hands , WAVE2 was not a great substrate for ERK2 unless it was incorporated in the WRC . Because we observe clear U0126 sensitivity at these sites in vivo , we conclude ERK phosphorylates both S343 and T346 and that JNK may also phosphorylate these sites under condi - tions in which JNK is active , such as cellular stress or starvation . Other proline - directed kinases such as Cdk5 , which phosphory - lates WAVE1 ( Kim et al . , 2006 ) , or Gsk - 3 may also participate in the basal - state WAVE2 and Abi1 phosphorylation . Mutation of the ERK phosphorylation sites on Abi1 signiﬁ - cantly inhibited WRC interaction with Arp2 / 3 and actin and cell protrusion and migration . Thus , phosphorylation of Abi1 is required for functional WRC . Mutation of the ERK phosphoryla - tion sites on WAVE2 induced an unregulated WAVE2 interaction with Arp2 / 3 and actin and inhibited cell protrusion . The Arp2 / 3 coimmunoprecipitation data suggest that a completely unphos - phorylated WAVE2 functions differently from a hypophosphory - lated WAVE2 , such as the WAVE2 in starved and U0126 - treated cells . As WAVE2 dimerizes to activate Arp2 / 3 ( Padrick et al . , 2008 ) , phosphorylation of one of the eight sites in the two proline - rich regions is likely needed for proper cycling of Arp2 / 3 binding , activation , and release during rapid protrusion . We conclude that the unregulated interaction of unphosphorylated WAVE2 with Arp2 / 3 functions in a dominant - negative manner , as microinjection of the WRC - A blocks EGF - induced protrusion . In a similar study , introduction of WAVE2 3A into NIH 3T3 cells had no effect PDGF - induced membrane rufﬂing ( Danson et al . , 2007 ) . However , knockdown of WAVE2 levels with siRNA also did not affect membrane rufﬂing in these cells , suggesting that the NIH 3T3 system does not model lamellipodial protrusion . In a wound healing assay , these authors found that WAVE2 3A increased NIH 3T3 migration speed and decreased persistence by reducing Golgi apparatus polarization , a function indepen - dent of Rac activity . While a wound healing assay involves direc - tionality and the loss of cell - cell adhesions , it is possible that this other function of WAVE2 could be at play in our migration assay , shadowing any defect in speed due to lamellipodia protrusion . Additionally , the WAVE2 3A mutant may retain enough activity in the presence of WT Abi1 and residual endogenous WAVE2 to complement the loss of migration speed induced by WAVE2 knockdown . ERK Regulation of Lamellopodial Protrusion ERK regulation of WRC activation likely controls lamellipodial protrusion via two non - mutually exclusive mechanisms . First , WRC activation leads to Arp2 / 3 activation and generation of the actin meshwork that provides the pushing force for protru - sion initiation and speed . Second , ERK may also control lamelli - podium protrusion by regulating the actin polymerization necessary for nascent adhesion formation . Rac activation and actin ﬁlament assembly are required for nascent adhesion formation in the lamellipodium ( Choi et al . , 2008 ; Nayal et al . , 2006 ) . These adhesions generate adhesion forces necessary for stable and persistent lamellipodium advancement without rufﬂing ( Giannone et al . , 2007 ; Ji et al . , 2008 ) . ERK and Rac may act together at the leading edge to activate the WRC and Arp2 / 3 to initiate and reinforce nascent adhesions . Indeed , in spreading macrophages , ERK functions to stabilize the Molecular Cell ERK Drives Protrusion via WRC Phosphorylation 668 Molecular Cell 41 , 661 – 671 , March 18 , 2011 ª 2011 Elsevier Inc . protruding lamellipodia , and its inhibition causes the production of transient , unstable protrusions ( Smith et al . , 2008 ) . Inhibition of ERK and the WRC eliminates protrusion and nascent adhesion formation . The cell peripheries are encircled by enlarged adhesion , and the cells contract . As ERK also regu - lates adhesion disassembly and maturation , via phosphorylation and activation of FAK and MLCK ( Webb et al . , 2004 ) , ERK’s role in promoting leading edge formation mechanistically links protrusion formation with mature adhesion disassembly . We propose that ERK signaling balances lamellipodia protrusion / retraction and adhesion assembly / disassembly . Thus , extracel - lular cues for increased ERK activity coordinately increase actin polymerization to generate protrusion force and adhesion turn - over for protrusion advancement . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture HMECs were obtained from Cambrex , immortalized , and cultured as previ - ously described ( Abe et al . , 2009 ) . HMECs were starved for 24 hr in DMEM / F - 12 , 35 mM HEPES , 0 . 5 m g / ml hydrocortisone . PtK 1 cells were cultured in F - 12 medium , 10 % FBS ( fetal bovine serum ) . Cos - 7 and 293T cells were cultured in DMEM , 10 % FBS . Cos - 7 cells were starved with 0 . 2 % FBS and 293Tcellswith0 % FBS . 293Fcellswerecultured inFreestyle medium ( Invitro - gen ) . Where indicated , cells were pretreated with 20 nM U0126 for 2 hr and stimulated with 20 ng / ml EGF for 2 . 5 or 5 min . Antibodies , Inhibitors , and siRNA Antibodies obtained from commercial sources include those used in immuno - blotting : anti - EGFR ( Santa Cruz ) ; B - Raf ( Santa Cruz ) ; p - ERK ( Sigma ) ; GAPDH ( Ambion ) ; Sra - 1 ( Upstate ) ; Nap1 ( Sigma ) ; Abi1 ( MBL ) ; WAVE2 ( Cell Signaling ) ; immunoprecipitation anti - Abi1 ( Bethyl ) ; and immunoﬂuorescence p - ERK ( Sigma ) , ERK ( Upstate ) , and WAVE2 ( Cell Signaling ) . The ERK antibodies used in immunoblots were previously described ( Murphy et al . , 2002 ) . The phospho - WAVE2andphospho - Abi1antibodiesweresynthesizedandpuriﬁed by Millipore : p - WAVE2 S308 ( 07 - 1511 ) , S343 ( 07 - 1512 ) , T346 ( 07 - 1513 ) , and S351 ( 07 - 1514 ) and p - Abi1 S225 ( 07 - 2129 ) . Mixes ( 20 nM ) of validated duplexes from QIAGEN were used for siRNA transfections . Protrusion Assays HMECs and PtK 1 cells were cultured on acid - washed glass coverslips and transferred to heated chambers on a Nikon Ti inverted ﬂuorescence micro - scope . Images were collected every 10 s using Metamorph software and a Hammamatsu ORCA - R2 camera . This sampling rate fully captures the protrusion / retraction behavior of morphologically active PtK 1 cells ( Machacek and Danuser , 2006 ) . HMECs were imaged in starve media using D . I . C . ﬁlters for 16 min . EGF ( 20 ng / ml ﬁnal concentration ) was added after 1 min . Ten HMECs per experi - mentweremanuallytraced , andthesurfaceareawascalculatedusingImageJ software . Experimental and control groups contained 3 – 4 samples of ten cells fortwo - tailed , unpaired t testanalysis . WRC wasdiluted to100nMinPBS and coinjected with 0 . 25 mg / ml FITC - dextran . Cells were recovered for 2 hr , and thenasingleepiﬂuorescenceimage wastakenwithaFITC - ﬁltercubetodocu - ment which cells were microinjected , and then the cells were imaged with D . I .

PtK 1 cells were imaged by epiﬂuorescence in L - 15 medium containing 20 mM HEPES and 0 . 03 U / ml Oxyrase with a 60 3 1 . 4 N . A . objective and 1 . 5 3 magniﬁcation . PtK 1 cell boundaries were extracted from the ﬂuores - cence microscopy data using adaptive thresholding combined with Canny edge detection . These cell edges were then tracked as described previously ( MachacekandDanuser , 2006 ) . Edgevelocitieswerecalculatedforeachpoint along the cell edge . The edge was then subdivided into 30 segments of equal length , and these velocities were averaged for each segment , excluding three segments on each end to eliminate effects of the image boundary . These protrusion velocities were then combined into activity maps . Areas of these maps with positive or negative velocity correspond to protruding and retract - ingareasonthecelledge , respectively . Two - tailed , unpairedttestswereused to calculate signiﬁcance between U0126 and control groups , with each group containing ﬁve cell edges segmented into 24 segments . Migration Assays Cellswereculturedonglass - bottomedMatekdishes . Wellswerecoveredwith mineral oil before transferring the plate to a 37 (cid:3) C incubation chamber on an inverted ﬂuorescence microscope . Images were collected every 10 min with Metamorph software for 10 hr . Migration of the nucleus was calculated using the Track Points function in Metamorph . Every Alexa 555 - labeled cell that did not divide or move out of the ﬁeld of view was included in the analysis ( 11 – 20 cells ) . Immunoﬂuorescence For confocal immunoﬂuorescence , cells were ﬁxed in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in PBSfor15min , rinsedwithPBS , andblocked andpermeabilizedin3 % bovine serum albumin , 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 for 30 min . Primary antibodies were incu - bated in WIS ( 1 % BSA , 0 . 2 % Tween - 20 in PBS ) overnight at 4 (cid:3) C . Cells were washed with WIS before incubation with ﬂuorophore - conjugated secondary antibodies , DAPI , and phalloidin for 1 hr . TIRF immunoﬂuorescence was carried out as previously described ( Vomastek et al . , 2007 ) . Images within each experiment were taken with the same exposure times and were scaled equivalently . To examine stain with respect to distance from the cell edge , the edge was found via automatic intensity histogram - based thresholding of the phalloidin stain . The distance from this edge at each point in the cell interior was calcu - lated via the distance transform . The average intensity in each channel was calculated for integer intervals of the distance transform , yielding the average intensity at each distance from the cell edge . As a validation of the cell edge location , the average intensities were also calculated 20 pixels outside of the identiﬁed cellboundary . Thisconﬁrmed that theﬂuorescence quicklydecayed tobackgroundlevelsoutsidetheidentiﬁedcelledge location ( FigureS2A ) . The colocalization of phospho - ERK and WAVE2 was analyzed via a nearest - neighbor , object - based colocalization method ( Lachmanovich et al . , 2003 ) . Punctae of WAVE2 and p - ERK staining were detected via laplacian - of - Gaussian ﬁltering followed by local maxima detection and local background estimation via low - pass ﬁltering . Punctae two standard deviations above background intensity were analyzed . For each detected puncta in the p - ERK channel , the nearest puncta in the WAVE2 channel was found , allowing constructionofanearest - neighbordistancehistogram . Foreachcell , arandom distribution of punctae of identical density wasalso created . The relative near - est - neighbor distance probabilities were calculated by dividing the observed distance histogram by the random distribution histogram . Labeling and Kinase Assays Formetaboliclabeling , cellswerestarved20hrinnormalstarvemediaand2hr in phosphate - free media . HMECs were then labeled with 1 mCi / ml 32 P ortho - phosphate for 2 hr , stimulated , and lysed with 20 mM Tris - Cl , 125 mM NaCl , 1 % TritonX - 100 , 1mMEDTAcontainingproteaseandphosphataseinhibitors . The WRC was immunoprecipitated using Protein A / G - conjugated anti - Abi1 or anti - FLAG and washed with lysis buffer before separation by SDS - PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane . For in vitro kinase assays , 2 . 5 ng active GST - ERK2 ( Upstate ) or immunoprecipitated HA - ERK2 from 293T cells ( stimu - lated with 100 ng / ml phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate for 15 min ) ( Dimitri et al . , 2005 ) was incubated with 125 m M ATP , 5 m Ci g - labeled ATP , and either 2 m g GST - Abi1 or 0 . 5 m g FLAG - puriﬁed WRC at 30 (cid:3) C for 15 or 30 min , respectively . Reactions were within the linear range for both time and substrate . Mass Spectrometry Coomassie - stained bands of WAVE2 and Abi1 were diced into 1 mm cubes . Gel pieces were reduced , alkylated with iodoacetamide , and subjected to in - gel digestion as described previously ( Zappaterra et al . , 2007 ) , except that a double digest using both trypsin and chymotrypsin was performed . Dried peptides were subjected to liquid chromatography - tandem mass Molecular Cell ERK Drives Protrusion via WRC Phosphorylation Molecular Cell 41 , 661 – 671 , March 18 , 2011 ª 2011 Elsevier Inc . 669 spectrometry in a linear ion trap ( LTQ ) - orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer ( Thermo Electron ) set up and run as described previously ( Ballif et al . , 2008 ) . Data were searched against databases for WAVE2 and Abi1 using Sequest , requiring no enzyme speciﬁcity ; allowing precursor m / z tolerances of 30 ppm ; allowing serine , threonine , and tyrosine residues to be phosphor - ylated ( + 79 . 96633 Da ) ; allowing methionine residues to be oxidized ( + 15 . 99492 Da ) ; and requiring cysteine residues to be carbamiodomethylated ( + 57 . 02146 Da ) . Each identiﬁed phosphopeptide was manually examined for accuracy of the Sequest assignment and had a measured monoisotopic mass different by less the 5 ppm m / z of the calculated monoisotopic mass . WRC Puriﬁcation To ensure we puriﬁed the intact WRC , we performed a two - step puriﬁcation in which ﬁrst 6xHis - Sra - 1 was afﬁnity puriﬁed using Ni - NTA agarose and then WAVE2 was immunoprecipitated using anti - Protein C ( for microinjections ) or FLAG ( for kinase assay substrate ) afﬁnity matrix . 293F cells were transfected with equal concentrations of pcDNA3 plasmids encoding T7 - Abi1 , V5 - Nap1 , 6xHis - Sra - 1 , myc - HSPC300 , and either Protein C - WAVE2 or FLAG - WAVE2 . After 72 hr , cells were lysed in WRC buffer ( 25 mM Tris [ pH 8 ] , 20 mM imid - azole , 150mMNaCl , 20 % glycerol ) containing1 % NP - 40 , 5mM b - mercaptoe - thanol , and protease and phosphatase inhibitors . Lysates were cleared by ultracentrifugation and subjected to Ni 2 + afﬁnity puriﬁcation for 1 hr using Ni - NTA agarose ( QIAGEN ) . The beads were washed with 8 CVs of WRC buffer containing 20 mM imidazole and 8 CVs of WRC buffer containing 40 mM imid - azole . TheWRCwaseluted fromtheagaroseonce with2 . 5CVsofWRCbuffer containing 100mM imidazole and once with2 . 5 CVs of WRC buffer containing 200 mM imidazole . CaCl 2 ( 1 mM ) was added to the combined eluate , and anti - PC or anti - FLAG puriﬁcation was carried out for 2 hr . PC immunoprecip - itations were eluted with 5 mM EGTA and FLAG with 0 . 2 m g / ml 3 3 FLAG peptide ( Sigma ) . PC puriﬁcations were buffer - exchanged into 10 mM imid - azole ( pH 7 ) , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , and 20 % glycerol using PD - 10 desalting columns ( Roche ) . Following concentration on Amicon Ultra - 15 columns , WRC was snap frozen and stored at (cid:4) 80 (cid:3) C . We quantiﬁed the puriﬁed WRCs using Coomassie - stained Nap1 and Sra - 1 bands , which did not exhibit phosphorylation - induced band - shifts . WRC Coimmunoprecipitation with Arp2 / 3 and Actin 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the WRC ( pCDNA3 / Flag - WAVE2 , pCDNA3 / T7 - Abi1 , pCDNA3 / V5 - Nap1 , pCDNA3 / S - Sra1 ) using calcium phosphate and starved of serum after 24 hr for 24 hr . The cells were then washed with PBS containing 1 mM CaCl 2 and 1 mM MgCl 2 and lysed with 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 20 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 125 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA , and protease and phosphatase inhibitors .
