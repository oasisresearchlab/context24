Gag is subsequently cleaved into its component domains , causing structural maturation to repurpose the virion for cell entry . We determined the structure and arrangement of MA within immature and mature HIV - 1 , providing a basis to understand MA’s role in virus assembly . Unexpectedly , we found that MA rearranges during maturation , to form a new , hexameric lattice in which the acyl chain of a phospholipid extends out of the membrane to bind a pocket in MA . Our data suggest that proteolytic maturation of HIV - 1 not only achieves assembly of the viral capsid surrounding the genome , but extends to repurpose the membrane - bound MA lattice for an entry or post - entry function , and causes partial removal of 2 , 500 acyl chains from the viral membrane . 2 Introduction Assembly and budding of HIV - 1 is initiated at the plasma membrane ( PM ) and driven primarily by a 55 - kDa viral polyprotein named Gag . Gag consists of an N - terminal matrix ( MA ) domain , responsible for recruitment to the PM , the capsid ( CA ) domain , which induces Gag self - assembly via protein - protein interactions , the nucleocapsid ( NC ) domain , which recruits the viral RNA genome to the assembly site , as well as some minor peptide domains ( 1 , 2 ) . Protein - protein , protein - lipid and protein - RNA interactions lead to clustering of Gag at the assembly site , membrane bending , and subsequent release of the membrane - enveloped immature HIV - 1 particle . Concomitant with , or shortly after release , the viral protease ( PR ) cleaves Gag at multiple positions leading to a dramatic structural rearrangement to repurpose the virus particle for entry into a target cell . Maturation results in condensation of a ribonucleoprotein complex ( RNP ) from NC and RNA , which becomes surrounded by the cone - shaped capsid made of CA , while mature MA is thought to remain associated with the viral membrane . Rearrangement of the HIV - 1 envelope ( Env ) glycoprotein on the particle surface is presumed to render the virion fusogenic ( 2 , 3 ) . The structure of the heterologously - expressed , 17 - kDa MA protein has been determined , revealing a small folded domain composed of five alpha helices and one 3 10 helix between helices 2 and 3 ( 4 , 5 ) . MA crystallizes as a trimer ( 5 ) , and multimerizes on artificial membrane monolayers into a hexameric lattice of trimers with holes or gaps at the six - fold symmetric positions in the lattice ( 6 ) . These holes have been suggested to provide binding sites for the C - terminal tail of HIV - 1 Env and promote Env incorporation into assembling virions ( 7 , 8 ) . Membrane recruitment of Gag via MA is mediated by an N - terminal myristate moiety as well as by a highly basic region ( HBR , residues 17 - 31 ) ( 9 , 10 ) . The N - terminal myristate is thought to be in equilibrium between sequestration in a pocket in the MA domain , and an exposed conformation ( 11 ) – the so - called myristoyl switch . Myristate exposure can be promoted by trimerization of MA ( 11 ) . Additionally , binding of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in an extended - lipid conformation to a pocket on the side of MA had been proposed to promote exposure of the myristate and its insertion into the lipid bilayer ( 12 ) . This mode of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding , in which the 2´ acyl chain of the lipid would have to be pulled out of the bilayer , is no longer widely considered relevant to MA - membrane interactions during virus assembly , which instead are likely to be between the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 headgroup and the membrane - facing basic MA residues ( 13 - 15 ) . MA interacts with nucleic acids in the cytosol , in particular tRNA , via the HBR ( 16 , 17 ) . These observations support a model in which exchange of nucleic acid for the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 head group promotes myristate exposure and stabilization of PM binding during virus assembly ( 16 , 17 ) . The known roles of MA are performed during virus assembly , and no function for MA during entry or post - entry stages is currently established . Models for how MA functions during assembly are limited by the current lack of structural information on MA within virions . It is unclear what conformation and arrangement MA adopts in situ , and whether MA undergoes any structural changes in the process of virus maturation . Here , we set out to determine the structure and arrangement of MA within immature and mature virus particles . Results and Discussion Purified mature particles generated by transfection of a non - infectious HIV - 1 proviral derivative that expresses all viral proteins except for Nef ( pcHIV ) ( 18 ) , and immature particles generated by transfection of pcHIV carrying an active site mutation in PR ( pcHIV 3 PR - ) were imaged without chemical fixation using cryo - electron tomography ( cryo - ET ) . Visual inspection of tomograms revealed the expected features : a striated CA layer in immature virus particles , and conical CA cores in mature virus particles ( Fig . 1A - B ) . In some regions underlying the lipid envelope of mature virions , we observed regular lattice - like features ( Fig . 1C ) . We subjected the region underlying the viral membrane in immature cHIV particles to reference - free subtomogram averaging . This analysis revealed a hexameric lattice of MA trimers with a hexamer - hexamer spacing of 9 . 8 nm containing large holes at the six - fold axes ( Fig . 2A ) , reminiscent of the lattices observed for membrane - associated purified MA in vitro ( 6 ) . In order to improve the spatial resolution of the immature MA structure , we analysed a cryo - ET dataset of fixed , immature , complete HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 particles ( 19 ) . From this dataset , we obtained the same MA lattice structure at 7 . 2 Å resolution ( Fig . 2B - F , Fig . S1 ) . The poorly - ordered and sparse MA lattice covered only small patches of the inner membrane leaflet , while in other areas MA did not appear to form a lattice , suggesting heterogeneity in MA packing ( Fig . 2G , Fig . S2 ) . Despite this heterogeneity , we could clearly resolve alpha - helices ( Fig . 2C - F ) . The MA trimer structure determined by crystallography ( PDBID : 1HIW ) ( 5 ) could be fitted into the density as a rigid body . The MA domain of Gag is therefore present as a trimer within immature HIV - 1 particles ( Fig . 2D , Fig . S3A ) . MA helices 1 and 2 lie approximately parallel to the membrane and form a surface rich in charged and hydrophobic residues by which MA is attached to the inner membrane leaflet ( Fig . 2C , F ) . MA trimers are packed together to form a lattice by a novel dimeric interface where the N - terminal residues and the N - terminus of helix 1 interact with themselves and the 3 10 helix ( Fig . 2D , E ) . We did not observe any density corresponding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the described binding site on the side of MA next to the HBR ( 12 ) ( Fig . 2F ) . Its absence is consistent with current models in which the head group of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 functions as the major cellular determinant of efficient MA - PM targeting by binding to the membrane - proximal face of MA ( 13 , 20 ) . The N - terminal region ( residues 1 - 11 ) that changes conformation during the myristoyl switch ( 11 , 21 ) , is directly involved in the trimer - trimer interactions ( Fig . S3B ) . At lower isosurface thresholds , a connection to the membrane appears in the vicinity of the N - terminus of helix 1 ( Fig . 2E ) , while no notable density was observed in the myristoyl pocket ( Fig . S3C ) . The conformational equilibrium is therefore shifted towards the exposed , membrane - inserted conformation in the immature virion , consistent with the myristate moiety becoming exposed upon MA oligomerization or membrane recruitment . The C - terminal helix 5 of MA extends towards the centre of the virus particle and is separated from the underlying CA layer by a disordered stretch containing the MA / CA cleavage site ( Fig . 2C ) . CA is therefore not resolved when MA is aligned , and equivalently MA is not resolved when CA is aligned ( Fig . S4 ) . The position of MA is thus constrained but not fixed relative to CA . A number of studies have implied that holes in a hypothetical MA lattice may present a binding site for the cytoplasmic tail of Env , and mutations affecting MA trimerization have been shown to affect Env incorporation ( 6 , 7 , 22 ) . Here we found that MA does form a lattice containing holes . We did not observe density for the Env tail in the holes , but that is not to be expected given the low Env copy number per particle ( 23 ) . A number of mutations in MA have been reported to result in defects in Env incorporation ( 7 , 8 , 22 , 24 - 27 ) ( Fig . 2H , red , purple and blue spheres ) . Many of the mutated residues ( red and purple spheres ) are not exposed towards the central hole , but are rather located at sites close to the N - terminal residues of MA or the intra - and inter - trimer interfaces consistent with their phenotype in MA trimerization ( Fig . 2H ) . These mutations are thus likely to modulate MA trimerization or 4 lattice formation , and / or the myristoyl switch , but would not be presumed to directly control Env cytoplasmic tail binding within the holes . This is consistent with the model that correct MA oligomerization is required for Env incorporation ( 8 , 28 ) . We next subjected the region underlying the membrane in mature cHIV particles to reference - free subtomogram averaging . This analysis revealed large patches of a hexagonal lattice of MA trimers with a hexamer - hexamer spacing of ~ 8 . 8 nm . These dimensions are similar to the 9 nm repeating MA lattice observed in anomalous , multi - cored , membranous particles ( 29 ) . We resolved the structure of the lattice to a resolution of 9 . 5 Å ( Fig . 3A ) . The mature lattice , like the immature lattice , is formed from MA trimers arranged in a hexagonal lattice , though it has a higher degree of regularity than the immature MA lattice ( Fig . S2 ) . The arrangement of MA within the immature and mature MA lattices is , however , strikingly different ( compare Figs . 2 and 3 ) – the MA lattice undergoes structural maturation to form a new , different hexagonal lattice in the mature virion . We had previously determined the structure of the CA layer within cHIV derivatives in which the PR cleavage site between MA and CA was blocked by mutation as potential maturation intermediates ( HIV - 1 MA - CA and MA - SP1 ) ( 30 ) . CA and the CA lattice remain structurally immature in MA - CA and MA - SP1 . We now analysed the MA layer in these datasets , and found that the MA lattice in HIV - 1 MA - CA and MA - SP1 corresponds to that seen in mature particles , despite the absence of cleavage between MA and CA ( Fig . 3B , Fig . S5 ) . Cleavages downstream of SP1 are therefore sufficient for MA lattice maturation , which can occur without CA lattice maturation . It is unlikely that proteolytic cleavage between CA and NC could directly trigger MA maturation via a structural signal passed through CA without inducing any detectable structural change in CA . We therefore suggest that maturation of MA must be triggered “in trans” by another effector in the viroplasm or in the viral membrane . Further experiments will be required to elucidate the mechanism of MA maturation . Immature virions are fusion incompetent , and cleavages downstream of CA are sufficient to overcome this defect ( 31 ) . These observations suggest that structural maturation of MA , rather than of CA , correlates with HIV - 1 becoming fusogenic , potentially by allowing Env to redistribute on the virus surface ( 32 ) . We obtained a higher - resolution , 7 . 0 Å structure of the mature MA lattice from MA - SP1 particles , and - as for the immature MA lattice - the crystallographic trimer could be fitted into the density as a rigid body ( Fig . 3B - E , Fig . S1 ) . Comparison of the immature and mature MA structures revealed important differences ( Fig . 4 ) . In the immature lattice the HBR faces the holes at the six - fold axes , which are therefore surrounded by a basic surface ( Fig . 4B ) . In contrast , in the mature virus , MA presents a largely neutral surface towards the holes ( Fig . 4B ) . In the mature virus , basic residues in the HBR loop face acidic residues in the N - terminus of helix 4 ( 72E ) and the 3 10 helix ( 51E ) of the adjacent MA monomer to form the dimeric interface that links trimers together ( Fig . 3D , Fig . 4A , Fig . S3B ) . Unlike in the immature virus , where the lipid binding pocket on the side of MA is empty , in the mature virus it contains a density at the position previously described for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( PDBID : 2H3Q and 2H3V ) ( 12 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 can be modelled at this position in the extended - lipid conformation with the 2’ acyl chain removed from the bilayer , while the other acyl chain extends upwards towards the bilayer ( Fig . 3D , E , Fig . S6 ) . The PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding pocket is adjacent to the HBR , right at the centre of the dimer interface . The N - terminus of helix 1 prominently protrudes up into the PM , indicating that the myristate moiety retains an exposed , membrane - inserted conformation in the mature MA lattice . Taken together , our results ( summarized in Fig . S7 ) revealed that MA – similar to CA and NC – undergoes dramatic structural maturation to form very different lattices in immature 5 and mature HIV - 1 . Immature virions contain MA trimers packed together via their N - termini into a poorly - ordered hexagonal lattice containing basic - charged holes and disordered regions , which could accommodate the cytoplasmic tails of Env . The N - terminal myristate is inserted into the membrane . This immature MA structure provides a framework for understanding the established roles of MA in virus assembly and Env incorporation . Mature virions , in contrast , contain MA trimers packed together via their HBRs , resulting in a well - ordered hexagonal lattice with neutral holes . The maturation of MA is highly reminiscent of that of CA , which matures between two different hexameric protein lattices with two different functional roles ( 3 ) . Upon maturation , both the protein arrangement and the lipid - binding properties of MA change . When bound to mature MA in the extended - lipid conformation , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is pulled outwards from the lipid bilayer ( Fig . S6B ) and one acyl chain is removed from the membrane to bind at the centre of the trimer - trimer interface . The energy barrier to the removal of acyl chains from the bilayer may be overcome by binding of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to MA and stabilization of the MA lattice . Our data imply that maturation of Gag results in the partial removal of ~ 2 , 500 of the ~ 150 , 000 lipids in the inner leaflet of the viral membrane ( 20 ) . Our data suggest that the structural maturation of Gag not only condenses the RNP and achieves assembly of a viral capsid core surrounding the genome , but also rearranges the membrane - bound MA layer and modulates the lipid bilayer itself . How these changes alter the properties of the virus remains to be elucidated , but we speculate that they impact not only MA and Env function , but also the physical properties of the viral envelope . The unexpected presence of a different well - defined MA structure in mature virions suggests that MA performs new roles in the mature virion or after entry into the target cell . We speculate that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - stabilized MA lattices may remain membrane associated after virion fusion and have a post - entry function , perhaps acting as signalling platforms to prepare the target cell for early HIV - 1 replication . Materials and Methods Virus particle production and purification . HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 MA - SP1 PR + particles were prepared by iodixanol gradient purification exactly as described in ( 30 ) . cHIV and cHIV PR − particles were prepared for this study as follows : HEK 293T cells grown on 175 - cm 2 side - bottom tissue culture flasks were transfected with plasmid pcHIV ( 18 ) or pcHIV PR − ( 33 ) ( 70 µ g of plasmid per flask ) using a standard calcium phosphate transfection procedure . Culture media from producing cells were harvested at 48 h post - transfection and cleared by filtration through a 0 . 45 - µ m nitrocellulose filter . Particles from media were concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a 20 % ( wt / wt ) sucrose cushion ( 90 min at 27 , 000 rpm in a Beckman SW32 rotor ; Beckman Coulter Life Sciences ) . Pelleted particles were resuspended in PBS and stored in aliquots at − 80°C . Cryo - electron tomography Data imaging and processing were performed in parallel for cHIV PR - and cHIV particles . A suspension of purified viruses was diluted 10 : 1 with PBS solution containing 10 - nm colloidal gold beads . An aliquot of 2 . 5 µ l was applied on a glow - discharged C - Flat 2 / 2 3C grid ( Protochips ) , and automatically back - side blotted and plunge - frozen into liquid ethane using the Leica EM GP 2 . Grids were loaded into an FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV and imaging was performed on a Gatan BioQuantum K3 in super - resolution mode . Tomographic tilt series between − 60° and + 60° were collected using SerialEM - 3 . 7 . 0 software ( 34 ) in a dose - symmetric scheme ( 35 ) with a 3° angular increment . 6 The nominal magnification was 64 kx , giving a pixel size of 1 . 386 Å on the specimen . For other samples , data acquisition was performed similarly , on a Gatan Quantum 968 K2 in counting mode . All data acquisition parameters are listed in Table S1 . Frames were motion - corrected in IMOD - 4 . 10 . 18 ( 36 ) . K3 data were dose - filtered in IMOD - 4 . 10 . 18 , K2 data were dose - filtered in MATLAB ( MathWorks ) . Exposure filtering was implemented according to the cumulative dose per tilt as described elsewhere ( 37 ) . Fiducial - alignment of all tilt stacks was performed in IMOD - 4 . 10 . 18 or older versions . Each tilt stack before dose - filtering was used to estimate the contrast transfer function ( CTF ) by CTFFIND - 4 . 1 . 5 ( 38 ) or ctfplotter ( 39 ) . Motion - corrected and dose - filtered tilt stacks were CTF - corrected by CTF multiplication and tomograms were reconstructed by weighted back - projected in NovaCTF - 1 . 0 . 0 ( 40 ) . The replicate of HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 PR - was CTF - corrected by phase flipping and reconstructed in IMOD - 4 . 9 . 0 . Subtomogram averaging Subtomogram alignment and averaging were implemented using MATLAB ( MathWorks ) scripts derived from the TOM1 ( 41 ) and AV3 ( 42 ) packages as described previously ( 30 ) . The missing wedge was modelled as the summed amplitude spectrum of background subtomograms for each tomogram , and was applied during alignment and averaging . Structure determination from immature particles and cleavage mutants . Complete virus particles with distinct Gag layers were identified in 8 - fold binned ( bin8 ) tomograms and the centre of each virus was manually marked using “Volume Tracer” in UCSF Chimera ( 43 ) . The irregular packing , small size , and proximity of MA to both CA and the membrane , make it challenging to solve the MA structure . To reduce the required search space , we first determined the structure of the CA layer as previously described ( 19 ) and thereby determined the location of CA hexamers . These positions were used to derive initial estimates of the position and orientation of MA . To derive CA positions for HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 PR - , cHIV MA - SP1 and cHIV MA - CA , we made used of CA alignments from the published datasets ( 19 , 30 ) , performing minor reprocessing as necessary to ensure that as many CA positions as possible were retained during alignment . To derive CA positions for cHIV PR - , HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 MA - SP1 , and for a replicate of HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 PR - , the radius of the CA shell was measured and a mesh of initial extraction points was seeded on a spherical surface at this radius using MATLAB or a custom plug - in “Pick Particle” for UCSF Chimera ( https : / / www2 . mrc - lmb . cam . ac . uk / groups / briggs / resources / ) . An initial average of subtomograms from one bin8 tomogram was used as a starting reference for three iterations of translational and rotational alignment with a 50 - Å low - pass filter and no symmetry applied . A reference - free structure was obtained and two further iterations were performed with 6 - fold symmetry . All CA subtomograms were aligned against the 6 - fold symmetrized reference at bin8 and further aligned at bin4 with 50 - Å and 40 - Å low - pass filters , respectively . Duplicated positions in the CA lattice were removed and then the lattice completeness was inspected manually . CA hexamers that were mis - aligned or with low CCC values were cleaned manually and then the dataset was split by virus particle number into two halves for further independent processing at bin2 and bin1 , adapting the low - pass filter and angular search range appropriately while monitoring the resolution reported from the Fourier shell correlation ( FSC ) . We then extracted subtomograms at the expected radial position of MA , at locations directly above the 3 - fold symmetry axes of the CA lattice , from bin2 tomograms . Preliminary orientations were assigned based on the orientation of the CA 3 - fold symmetry axis . An initial reference was obtained by directly averaging the extracted subtomograms . For HIV - 7 1 NL4 - 3 PR - , alignments were tested applying C1 or C3 symmetry , both of which showed clear 3 - fold symmetry . We therefore proceeded for all samples with alignments starting with 25 Å low - pass filter and C3 symmetry . After each iteration of alignment , we calculated the pairwise distance of all trimers in the dataset , and plotted the relative positions of all neighbouring MA trimers within about 8 . 6 nm distance ( the typical MA trimer - trimer distances we observed were 5 . 6 nm for immature - like and 5 . 1 nm for mature - like particles ) ( Fig . S1 ) . We averaged MA trimers for which all three neighbouring MA trimers were also present in the dataset to generate a new reference for the next alignment . After three further iterations of alignment at bin2 , we again selected the MA trimers for which all three neighbouring MA trimers were present , and aligned only this subset at bin1 until the resolution no longer improved . Resolution was measured from the phase randomization - corrected FSC between the two independent half datasets at 0 . 143 cut - off , using a mask considering only the central MA trimer . For structures at > 8 Å resolution , the combined maps were filtered and sharpened by an empirically determined B factor . For structures at < 8 Å resolution , the combined maps were locally filtered and sharpened by using a B factor estimated by the Guinier plot in Relion ( 44 ) . Structure determination from mature particles . In mature virions , CA cannot be used to derive approximate MA positions . We therefore segmented viral membranes using ilastik - 1 . 3 . 3 ( 45 ) and extracted subtomograms at the inner surface of the membrane in bin6 tomograms . These were averaged and an arbitrary round density was placed at the centre of the box to facilitate initial convergence . Iterative alignments with a 50 Å low - pass filter was performed converging to a regular hexameric lattice . Bin4 subtomograms were then extracted and aligned against the 6 - fold symmetrized reference . Duplicated positions in the MA lattice were removed and the dataset was split by virus particle number into two halves for further independent processing . Based on the positions of the aligned hexamers , the coordinates and orientations of trimers were calculated , and subtomograms containing trimers were extracted from bin2 data . Further alignments at bin2 and bin1 were performed until the structure converged . A biological replicate was performed using the 50 Å filtered reference which converged to the same structure , and the two datasets were therefore combined from bin2 to generate the final structure . Structure interpretation The crystal structure ( 1HIW ) of an MA trimer ( 5 ) was fitted into the immature and mature MA structures as a rigid body . To analyse the Myristate and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding sites , we fitted the NMR structures of MA monomers with Myristate either exposed ( 2H3Q ) or sequestered ( 2H3I ) ( 12 ) . The lattice maps of CA hexamers and MA trimers were generated using the PlaceObject plugin ( 46 ) for UCSF Chimera . The electrostatic surfaces of immature and mature MA lattices were calculated in the APBS plugins ( 47 ) for PyMOL ( The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System , Version 1 . 8 Schrödinger , LLC . ) . 8 Acknowledgments We thank Wim Hagen , Dustin Morado , Aaron Tan , Florian Schur , and Simone Mattei for technical assistance , and Petr Chlanda and Leo James for helpful discussions .

( C , D ) An isosurface view of the cryo - ET reconstruction for mature cHIV MA - SP1 MA lattice fitted with the structure of monomeric MA , cut perpendicular to the membrane ( C ) or viewed from the top towards the membrane center ( D ) . The two layers of density corresponding to the lipid headgroup layers are indicated by brackets . The structure of monomeric MA determined by NMR ( PDBID : 2H3Q ; colored blue to red from N to C terminus ) was fitted as a rigid body into the density . Helices 1 , 2 and 5 are marked . Density is observed in the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding site ( red arrowhead ) , and the structure of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 as resolved bound to MA by NMR ( PDBID : 2H3V ) , is shown as a stick model .

Comparison of the immature and mature HIV - 1 MA lattices . ( A ) Immature and mature MA lattices are shown with one trimer aligned . In the immature lattice , contact with neighbouring trimers is mediated by N - terminal regions and the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding site is empty . In the mature lattice , contact with neighbouring trimers is mediated by the region surrounding the occupied PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding site . ( B ) Electrostatic surface potential maps of the hexameric lattice of immature and mature MA trimers . The red ( - 5 kT / e ) and blue ( + 5 kT / e ) colours represent negatively and positively charged electric potentials . One MA trimer aligned as in ( A ) is outlined in black . The potential of the surface of MA facing the holes at the hexamer positions in the lattice changes from positive to neutral / negative during maturation . The hole becomes smaller . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is shown in yellow . 17 Fig . S1 . Fourier shell correlation ( FSC ) curves to measure the resolution of MA lattice structures . Phase randomization - corrected FSC curves were calculated between two independent half - maps masked by a cylinder including the central MA trimer . Resolution values were reported at the 0 . 143 threshold . cHIV ( mature , blue ) , HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 PR - ( immature , red ) and cHIV MA - SP1 ( mature , black ) . 18 Fig . S2 . Comparison of immature and mature HIV - 1 MA lattices . ( A ) Further examples of lattice maps derived from subtomogram averaging , for the immature MA lattice ( left ) , for the mature MA lattice from MA - SP1 ( center ) , and for the mature MA lattice derived from mature cHIV particles ( right ) . Lattice maps are displayed as in Fig . 2G and Fig . 3F , Positions and orientations of MA trimers are shown as triangles colored on a scale from red ( lower cross correlation to average structure ) to green ( higher cross correlation to average structure ) . Where present , the positions of immature CA hexamers are indicated as blue hexagons to illustrate the relationship between MA and CA layers . ( B ) Heatmaps of neighbour plots for immature and mature MA trimers to illustrate the regularity of the lattices in ( A ) . Peaks ( red ) denote the positions of all neighbouring MA trimers relative to a central trimer ( position marked by a black cross ) , averaged for all trimers in the lattice . Peaks representing the first , second and third order neighbours are distinctly visible for both immature and mature lattices . Long - distance order is only observed in the mature MA lattice . Sharper peaks correspond to a more regular lattice . 19 Fig . S3 . Further comparison of immature and mature HIV - 1 MA lattices . ( A ) Immature and mature ( MA - SP1 ) MA lattices are shown with one trimer aligned . In both cases the central pore of the MA trimer is occluded , and is surrounded by a positively charged electric potential contributed by three arginines ( R42 ) . This site corresponds to that previously observed to interact with phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) and phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) , but the available space after trimerization cannot accommodate a lipid . ( B ) Immature and mature MA shown in cartoon representation . Left : in the immature MA lattice , inter - trimer interactions are mediated by N - terminal residues that change conformation between myristate - exposed and myristate - inserted states ( residues 1 - 11 , orange ) . Right : in the mature MA , basic residues in the HBR loop ( blue ) face acidic residues in the N - terminus of helix 4 ( 72E ) and the 3 10 helix ( 51E ) of the adjacent MA monomer ( red ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is shown in yellow . ( C ) An enlargement of MA monomer from the immature ( left ) and mature ( right ) MA trimers , shown as grey isosurface , and fitted with the NMR structure ( 2H3I ) of MA with sequestered myristate . The myristate is shown as pink spheres . No significant EM density was observed in the myristoyl pocket , indicating that the myristate is not sequestered . 20 Fig . S4 . Orthoslices perpendicular to the viral membrane through different reconstructions show no fixed relationship between MA and CA layers and no ordered density is found between CA and MA layers . ( A ) Alignments focus on the CA lattice resulting in blurred MA layers ( MA layer at position of orange dashed line ) . Published CA structures are shown on the left ( HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 PR - , EMD - 4017 ) and right ( cHIV MA - SP1 , EMD - 0164 ) . ( B ) From the same datasets , with alignments focussed on the MA layer , the CA layer becomes blurred ( CA position at cyan dashed line ) . 21 Fig . S5 . Mature HIV - 1 MA structures in HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 MA - SP1 ( left ) and cHIV MA - CA ( right ) , derived as additional control experiments . As expected , orthoslices through the MA layer show an identical mature MA arrangement to that seen in lattices in mature cHIV and cHIV MA - SP1 particles as shown in Figure 3A . 22 Fig . S6 . The position of bound PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the mature HIV - 1 MA lattice . ( A ) PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( yellow and red ) from the NMR structure ( PDBID : 2H3V ) was fitted as a rigid body together with the MA model ( PDBID : 2H3Q ) into the mature MA density ( transparent grey ) . The 1’ acyl chain points upwards towards the membrane while and the 2’ acyl chain ( down ) is sequestered in the MA layer . ( B ) The position of the mature HIV - 1 MA lattice relative to the bilayer is shown by fitting a model for the bilayer ( 48 ) into the membrane density in the MA structure . This representation highlights that the headgroup of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( yellow and red spheres ) is moved outwards from the bilayer and embedded in the binding pocket , the 1’ acyl chain ( up ) is partially pulled out from the bilayer and passes through the lipid headgroup layer , and the 2’ acyl chain is completely removed from the bilayer . The exposed N - terminal myristate ( green spheres ) is fully inserted into the inner leaflet of lipid bilayer . 23 Fig . S7 . Schematic illustrations of MA - MA and MA - membrane interactions during assembly and maturation . ( A ) Gag in the cytosol binds RNA and assembles at the plasma membrane leading to formation of a bud . During or after virus release , the immature virus undergoes proteolytic maturation to form the mature virion . The MA - SP1 cleavage mutant may not represent a true maturation intermediate . Boxed regions are highlighted in ( B ) . ( B ) Interactions between Gag and the plasma membrane via PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( PIP2 ) and myristate ( MYR ) . In the cytosol , the N - terminal myristate is sequestered in MA and RNA is bound to the HBR . In the assembling and immature virion , RNA is released from the HBR while the myristate is exposed and inserted into the plasma membrane . After proteolytic cleavage between SP1 and NC , the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 head group and unsaturated 2’ acyl chain are pulled out from the PM and sequestered in a positively charged pocket on MA . ( C ) Structural maturation of HIV - 1 MA . In the immature MA lattice , MA trimer - trimer interactions are formed by the N - terminal domain in the vicinity of the exposed myristate moiety , while the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding pocket is empty . In the mature MA lattice , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is bound to its binding pocket at the side of MA and MA trimer - trimer interactions are formed by the HBR and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . 24 Sample cHIV PR - Transfection I cHIV Transfection I cHIV Transfection II HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 MA - SP1 HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 PR - Replicate HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 PR - a cHIV MA - SP1 b cHIV MA - CA b Data acquisition Microscope FEI Titan Krios FEI Titan Krios FEI Titan Krios FEI Titan Krios FEI Titan Krios FEI Titan Krios FEI Titan Krios FEI Titan Krios Voltage ( keV ) 300 300 300 300 300 300 300 300 Energy - filter ( eV ) 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 Detector Gatan BioQuantum K3 Gatan BioQuantum K3 Gatan BioQuantum K3 Gatan K2 Summit Gatan K2 Summit Gatan K2 Summit Gatan K2 Summit Gatan K2 Summit Pixel size ( Å ) 1 . 386 1 . 386 1 . 386 1 . 379 1 . 35 1 . 35 1 . 35 1 . 35 Defocus range ( microns ) - 2 . 0 to - 4 . 5 - 4 . 5 to - 7 . 5 - 4 . 5 to - 7 . 5 - 1 . 1 to - 3 . 1 - 2 . 0 to - 4 . 0 - 1 . 5 to - 5 . 0 - 1 . 5 to - 5 . 0 - 1 . 5 to - 5 . 0 Acquisition scheme - 60 / 60˚ , 3˚ - 60 / 60˚ , 3˚ - 60 / 60˚ , 3˚ - 60 / 60˚ , 3˚ - 60 / 60˚ , 3˚ - 60 / 60˚ , 3˚ - 60 / 60˚ , 3˚ - 60 / 60˚ , 3˚ Total Dose ( electrons / Å 2 ) ~ 120 ~ 120 ~ 120 ~ 120 ~ 95 ~ 120 - 221 ~ 145 ~ 150 Dose rate ( electrons / Å 2 / sec ) ~ 13 . 0 ~ 13 . 0 ~ 13 . 0 ~ 2 . 1 ~ 4 . 6 ~ 1 . 5 – 5 . 5 ~ 2 . 3 ~ 2 . 3 Frame number 10 10 10 10 5 10 - 12 10 21 Tomogram number 53 25 20 26 32 74 65 70 Image processing Virus particles 278 122 106 155 476 350 302 Subtomogram ( set A / B ) 7 , 254 / 6 , 7 69 15 , 384 / 14 , 895 12 , 372 / 11 , 756 24 , 663 / 24 , 370 10 , 980 / 11 , 437 9 , 601 / 9 , 985 14 , 150 / 15 , 333 Symmetry C3 C3 C3 C3 C3 C3 C3 Resolution at 0 . 143 FSC ( Å ) 13 . 3 9 . 5 10 . 6 9 . 6 7 . 2 7 . 0 6 . 6 B factor - 500 - 500 - 500 - 500 - 597 - 521 - 511 a Data published previously is reinvestigated ( 19 ) . b Data published previously is reinvestigated ( 30 ) .
