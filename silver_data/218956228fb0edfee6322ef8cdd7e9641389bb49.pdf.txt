The frequency dependence of the shear modulus reﬂects the underlying single - ﬁlament relaxation dynamics for 0 : 1 – 10 rad = sec . Moreover , the nonlinear strain stiffening of such networks exhibits a universal form as a function of prestress ; this is quantitatively explained by the full force - extension relation of single semiﬂexible ﬁlaments .

Ka Actin is a protein found in abundance in all eukaryotic cells ; it can polymerize to form semiﬂexible ﬁlaments ( F actin ) . Reconstituted actin ﬁlaments are an excellent model for the study of the properties of entangled semi - ﬂexible polymer solutions [ 1 – 4 ] . In vivo , a myriad of actin binding proteins can both cross - link and bundle actin ﬁlaments to create rigid actin networks that provide an essential mechanical component in living cells ; these networks are critical in cell morphology , mechanoprotec - tion , and motility [ 5 ] . The elasticity of these networks depends crucially on the semiﬂexibility of individual ﬁlaments , as well as the interactions between ﬁlaments due to cross - links or bundles [ 1 , 6 – 9 ] . Knowledge of the underlying origin of the elasticity of such cross - linked networks is essential to determine the precise role of the behavior of the cytoskeleton in cellular functions . The elasticity of entangled solutions of actin ﬁlaments , in the absence of cross - links , is entropic in origin [ 3 , 4 ] . As the degree of cross - linking or bundling increases , the role of entropy should decrease as enthalpic effects become more important [ 8 , 9 ] . However , the relative contribution of enthalpic effects , and the contribution of the entropic ﬂuctuations of the actin ﬁlaments that make up in vivo networks remain unclear . Thus , the underlying mecha - nisms of the mechanical response of cross - linked actin networks remain largely unknown . In this Letter , we demonstrate that the macroscopic mechanical response of F - actin networks can be ex - plained quantitatively in terms of single - ﬁlament elastic - ity and dynamics , over a large range of ﬁlament and cross - linker concentrations . We show that the linear vis - coelasticity of cross - linked networks of F actin can be scaled onto a single master curve as a function of fre - quency , despite orders of magnitude variation in the elas - tic moduli . This scaling reveals that the relaxation dynamics of single ﬁlaments is the dominant mechanism of dissipation in these cross - linked networks , even at low frequencies . We also probe the nonlinear elastic response of the network by prestressing the networks with an external steady shear stress . We observe a dramatic stress stiffening of the elastic response for cross - linked net - works ; this follows a universal form which can be quan - titatively explained by the force - extension relation of a single semiﬂexible polymer . These results demonstrate that the entropic effects of single ﬁlaments dominate the full range of mechanical and dynamical properties of F - actin networks . We use scruin to rigidly cross - link and bundle actin ﬁlaments [ 10 ] . Found in vivo in the acrosome of the horseshoe - crab sperm , scruin heterodimers bind to adja - cent actin monomers on an individual actin ﬁlament ; cross - links between neighboring ﬁlaments are medi - ated through scruin - scruin interactions [ 11 , 12 ] . Scruin has the advantage that its bonds are both noncompliant and irreversible , ensuring that the network response re - ﬂects that of the actin ﬁlaments alone [ 13 ] . We vary the degree of cross - linking and bundling of ﬁlaments by altering the relative concentrations of scruin , c S , to actin , c A . Thus we tune R (cid:1) c S = c A from zero to one . Solutions of monmeric actin are prepared and stored at 4 (cid:2) C in G - buffer [ 2 mM Tris HCl , 0 . 2 mM ATP ( adenine triphos - phate ) , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT ( dithiothreitol ) , 0 . 005 % NaN 3 , p H 8 . 0 ] for up to 10 d . Samples are pre - pared by gently mixing monomeric actin , scruin , and 10 x F - buffer ( 20 mM Tris HCl , 20 mM MgCl 2 , 1 M KCl , 2mM DTT , 2mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM ATP , p H 7 . 5 ) . The solu - tion is loaded within 1 min of mixing into a stress - controlled rheometer with 40 mm parallel plate geometry and 160 (cid:9) m plate separation ; the sample volume is (cid:3) 250 (cid:9) L . We conﬁrm that the results are independent of geometry . We use a solvent trap to prevent drying , and equilibrate the sample for 1 h at 25 (cid:2) C .

(cid:6) , and viscous , G 00 (cid:5) ! (cid:6) , moduli using a maximum strain of (cid:12) (cid:3) 0 : 03 . The mechanical response of all the networks over a large range of c A and R is dominated by a nearly fre - quency independent elastic modulus which deﬁnes the elastic plateau modulus G 0 . The magnitude of G 0 can be varied over 3 orders of magnitude by changing either c A or R . For example , G 0 increases from 0 . 1 to 300 Pa when R is increased from 0 . 001 ( squares ) to one ( circles ) for a constant actin concentration , c A (cid:1) 11 : 9 (cid:9) M , as shown in Fig . 1 ( a ) . In contrast , G 00 (cid:5) ! (cid:6) is frequency dependent and does not vary uniformly with G 0 , as shown by the open symbols in Fig . 1 ( a ) . In general , as G 0 increases , G 00 (cid:5) ! (cid:6) becomes more frequency independent and its magnitude relative to G 0 decreases . Remarkably , despite these differences , the frequency - dependent viscoelastic response of all networks can be scaled onto a single pair of master curves , as shown in Fig . 1 ( c ) ; this is accomplished by independently scaling both the moduli and the frequency for each data set : the moduli are scaled by a factor b , while the frequency is scaled by a factor a . The scaled master curves highlight the fact that G 0 (cid:5) ! (cid:6) is nearly frequency independent and dominates the mechanical response over nearly six dec - ades in scaled frequency , ! a . Scaling of the mechanical response is ubiquitous in networks [ 14 ] , having been observed previously in microrheology measurements of actin networks [ 15 ] and in rheology measurements of weakly attractive colloidal gels [ 16 ] . By analogy to the scaling behavior of colloidal gels [ 16 ] , we assume that the complex viscoelasticity of cross - linked actin networks has two distinct contributions : At low frequencies , it is dominated by a frequency - independent elastic component , G 0 (cid:5) ! (cid:6) (cid:3) R (cid:15) c (cid:16)A , deter - mined by the network architecture , and , at high frequen - cies , it is dominated a frequency - dependent component , G 0 (cid:5) ! (cid:6) (cid:3) G 00 (cid:5) ! (cid:6) (cid:3) c A ! z , due to dynamics of individual actin ﬁlaments , and linearly dependent on c A [ 17 , 18 ] . Thus , the scaling factors can be rewritten as b (cid:3) c (cid:7) (cid:16)A R (cid:7) (cid:15) and a (cid:3) c (cid:5) 1 (cid:7) (cid:16) (cid:6) = z A R (cid:7) (cid:15) = z , which implies that bc A (cid:3) a z . We do indeed observe such power law scaling over nearly ﬁve decades , as shown in Fig . 2 , conﬁrming that this model correctly accounts for the scaling and captures the underlying origin of the network viscoelasticity . Moreover , the power law we observe is consistent with z (cid:1) 3 = 4 , indicated by the solid line Fig . 2 . Despite the fact that our measurements are restricted to low frequencies , the scaling behavior highlights high - frequency contribu - tions . Thus , this is direct evidence , using bulk rheology , that the high - frequency response is (cid:3) ! 3 = 4 , and reﬂects the high - frequency behavior of individual ﬁlaments [ 17 , 18 ] . Unlike the colloidal gels , the frequency - dependent elasticity of cross - linked actin networks is determined by two distinct contributions that arise from a single component , individual actin ﬁlaments . These results suggest that thermal ﬂuctuations of actin ﬁlaments dominate the frequency - dependent mechanical response of the network . The entropic spring constant of a thermally ﬂuctuating , semiﬂexible ﬁlament arises from the reduction of the ﬂuctuations in end - to - end distance of the ﬁlament as it is extended from its thermally con - tracted length to its full contour length . This entropic spring constant is highly dependent on the length of the ﬁlament , which is determined by the number of cross - links [ 7 ] . This is consistent with the large increase in G 0 of the network observed with an increase in R [ Fig . 1 ( a ) ] . FIG . 1 ( color online ) . G (cid:5) ! (cid:6) ( solid symbols ) and G 00 (cid:5) !

The correspond - ing network modulus is determined from the stress , (cid:3) F = (cid:23) 2 , where (cid:23) (cid:3) c (cid:7) 1 = 2 A is the mesh size . This modulus should diverge with increasing strain , reﬂecting the di - vergence in F . This suggests that a more sensitive test of the entropic origin of the network elasticity would be to measure the response under an applied prestress . When a steady shear stress , (cid:18) 0 , is applied , we observe a resultant strain (cid:12) 0 (cid:1) (cid:18) 0 = G 0 that does not vary with time . Upon removal of the shear stress , the strain recovers quickly to zero ; thus , the network response is predominately elastic and is completely recoverable . However , as the magnitude of the shear stress increases beyond the linear - response regime , (cid:12) 0 approaches a maximum ; this reﬂects a dra - matic decrease in the network compliance and directly reﬂects the corresponding divergence of the elastic modulus . To explore this dramatic stress stiffening in the non - linear elastic regime , we measure the differential , or incremental , elastic modulus . We superpose a small am - plitude oscillatory stress , (cid:24)(cid:18) (cid:5) ! (cid:6) (cid:3) j (cid:24)(cid:18) j e i ! t on a given (cid:18) 0 , and measure the oscillatory strain response , (cid:24)(cid:12) (cid:5) ! (cid:6) (cid:3) j (cid:24)(cid:12) j e i ! t ; when j (cid:24)(cid:18) (cid:5) ! (cid:6)j (cid:9) (cid:18) 0 = 10 , the oscillatory re - sponse is linear for all (cid:18) 0 . Thus , the complex differential elastic modulus is K (cid:10) (cid:5) ! ; (cid:18) 0 (cid:6) (cid:1) (cid:11) (cid:24)(cid:18) (cid:5) ! (cid:6) = (cid:24)(cid:12) (cid:5) ! (cid:6)(cid:12)j (cid:18) 0 . For small values of (cid:18) 0 , the frequency - dependent differential elastic modulus , K 0 (cid:5) ! ; (cid:18) 0 (cid:6) , and loss modulus , K 00 (cid:5) ! ; (cid:18) 0 (cid:6) are identical to G 0 (cid:5) ! (cid:6) and G 00 (cid:5) ! (cid:6) , respectively . As (cid:18) 0 is increased above some critical value , (cid:18) crit , the differential elastic modulus increases dramatically as shown in Fig . 1 ( b ) for a network with c A (cid:1) 11 : 9 (cid:9) M and R (cid:1) 0 : 13 ; K 0 (cid:5) ! (cid:6) increases by nearly a decade as (cid:18) 0 in in - creased from 0 Pa ( solid squares ) to 0 . 9 Pa ( solid tri - angles ) . The differential moduli continue to increase as a function of (cid:18) 0 until the network catastrophically breaks at a maximum stress , (cid:18) max . Intriguingly , we can rescale the frequency - dependent response of the prestressed net - works onto the same master curve of linear frequency - dependent moduli with similar scaling parameters for the zero prestress networks , as shown by the open squares in Fig . 2 . The slope of the scaling parameters for the pre - stressed samples may be somewhat less than 3 = 4 , which is consistent with the dynamics of ﬁlaments under static tension [ 21 , 22 ] . To quantify the nonlinear behavior , we measure K 0 (cid:5) (cid:18) 0 (cid:6) at a constant frequency , ! (cid:1) 0 : 62 rad = sec , as a function of (cid:18) 0 . For c A (cid:1) 29 : 4 (cid:9) M and R (cid:1) 0 : 03 , K 0 (cid:5) (cid:18) 0 (cid:6) is con - stant for 0 < (cid:18) 0 < 1 Pa and its magnitude , 9 Pa , is iden - tical to G 0 , as shown by the solid circles in Fig . 3 ; above (cid:18) 0 (cid:1) 1 Pa , K 0 increases rapidly , until the network cata - strophically breaks at (cid:18) max (cid:1) 14 Pa . We observe qualita - tively similar divergences of K 0 (cid:5) (cid:18) 0 (cid:6) as c A is decreased , as shown by the solid data points Fig . 3 . At low (cid:18) 0 , K 0 decreases with c A , reﬂecting the decrease in G 0 , whereas at high (cid:18) 0 , K 0 appears to asymptotically increase to the same values . A similar divergence is seen for R (cid:1) 0 : 5 , as illustrated by the open symbols in Fig . 3 . In this case , the ﬁlaments form thicker bundles [ 23 ] , resulting in a signiﬁ - cant reduction in the critical stress . To elucidate the mechanisms of this nonlinear elastic - ity , we examine the behavior of (cid:18) max . For R (cid:1) 0 : 03 , (cid:18) max increases approximately linearly with c A , as shown by the solid line in the inset of Fig . 3 . This trend is consistent with the behavior expected if the networks break by individual actin - ﬁlament rupture . A naive estimate of the breaking stress of a 24 - (cid:9) M cross - linked actin net - work is found by dividing the rupture force of an indi - vidual ﬁlament , (cid:3) 300 pN [ 24 ] , by the area per ﬁlament , (cid:23) 2 (cid:13) 0 : 1 (cid:9) m 2 [ 25 ] . However , given the nonlinear force - extension relation for a semiﬂexible ﬁlament in an iso - tropic network , the stress is effectively concentrated in the small fraction of ﬁlaments oriented at 45 (cid:2) in the shear plane . Accounting for these effects , we ﬁnd that the maximally stressed ﬁlaments are expected to rupture for network stresses of order tens of Pa [ 23 ] , consistent with our observations . Furthermore , we observe that , for constant c A , (cid:18) max is independent of cross - link density between 0 : 01 (cid:9) R (cid:9) 0 : 4 . This further supports our hy - pothesis that the mechanism of network breakage is by actin - ﬁlament rupture rather than stress - induced cross - link unbinding . The nonlinear mechanical response of the network directly reﬂects the nonlinear elastic response of single ﬁlaments [ 7 ] . We observe an increase of K 0 (cid:5) (cid:18) (cid:6) that is consistent with (cid:18) 3 = 2 , as indicated by the dashed line in Fig . 3 ; this reﬂects the nonlinear spring constant , FIG . 3 ( color online ) .

More precisely , K 0 (cid:3) d(cid:18) = d(cid:12) (cid:3) c (cid:7) 1 = 2 A (cid:18) 3 = 2 . To test this prediction , we plot c 1 = 2 A K 0 (cid:5) (cid:18) 0 (cid:6) = (cid:18) 3 = 2 0 . It approaches a constant value at high (cid:18) 0 , as shown in Fig . 4 . This is consistent with our prediction . This universality of the stress stiffening response is highlighted by rescaling the data sets by G 0 and (cid:18) crit . The stress stiffening responses for all the cross - linked and bundled networks exhibit identical functional forms , as shown in Fig . 4 . Moreover , we can plot the theoretically predicted form for a network of afﬁnely strained , semi - ﬂexible polymers directly onto the scaled data ; the agree - ment is very good , as shown by the solid line in the inset of Fig . 4 [ 23 ] . This is further conﬁrmation of our hypothe - sis that the full elastic response of the prestressed net - works can be directly understood in terms of the entropic stretching of single ﬁlaments . Scaling the bulk rheology of networks is a powerful means of elucidating microscopic mechanisms of network linear and nonlinear viscoelasticity . However , such scal - ing of the linear rheology may not be observed in en - tangled F - actin solutions without physical cross - links , where additional relaxation mechanisms may exist [ 26 ] . Furthermore , scaling of the nonlinear elasticity may not occur when the stress stiffening response is due to re - organization of the microstructure or if the network response is nonafﬁne [ 27 , 28 ] . Moreover , we expect that highly strained networks may begin to show evidence of enthalpic or nonafﬁne effects under high stress for some concentrations of cross - links or ﬁlaments . However , the results here provide convincing evidence for the role of entropic single - ﬁlament response over a wide range of network parameters . These highly cross - linked actin net - works are more akin to those found in cytoskeletal net - works in vivo , and the results presented here will help elucidate the origin of the elasticity of in vivo networks .
