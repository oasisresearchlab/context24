We now report that HIP1 and HIP12 are major components of the clathrin coat that interact but differ in their ability to bind clathrin and the clathrin adaptor AP2 . HIP1 contains a clathrin - box and AP2 con - sensus - binding sites that display high affinity binding to the terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain and the ear domain of the AP2 (cid:1) subunit , respectively . These consensus sites are poorly conserved in HIP12 and cor - respondingly , HIP12 does not bind to AP2 nor does it demonstrate high affinity clathrin binding . Moreover , HIP12 co - sediments with F - actin in contrast to HIP1 , which exhibits no interaction with actin in vitro . De - spite these differences , both proteins efficiently stimu - late clathrin assembly through their central helical do - main . Interestingly , in both HIP1 and HIP12 , this domain binds directly to the clathrin light chain . Our data suggest that HIP1 and HIP12 play related yet distinct functional roles in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Huntington disease , a neurological disorder characterized by selective loss of striatal and cortical neurons and manifest clinically by chorea and intellectual decline , results from poly - glutamine expansion of huntingtin into the pathologic range of beyond 35 repeats . In an effort to understand the disease mechanism , several groups have identified proteins that asso - ciate with huntingtin . One such protein , HIP1 , was identified in a yeast two - hybrid screen ( 1 , 2 ) . Binding of HIP1 to hunting - tin is dramatically reduced following polyglutamine expansion , strongly implicating this interaction in the disease process . Subsequent to the identification of HIP1 , a highly related pro - tein ( HIP12 / HIP1R ) was identified based on its homology to HIP1 ( 3 – 5 ) . In contrast to HIP1 , HIP12 does not bind directly to huntingtin ( 5 ) . HIP1 and HIP12 are orthologues of yeast Sla2p , a protein that functions in both endocytosis and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton ( 6 – 9 ) . Each of these proteins contains an ENTH ( epsin N - terminal homology ) domain that is thought to be involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis through binding to phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate - containing membranes ( 10 – 13 ) . The central portion of these proteins consists of a helical domain with a high probability to form coiled - coil inter - actions , followed by a C - terminal talin - homology domain . The talin - homology domain has been shown to bind F - actin in Sla2p and HIP12 suggesting a function in linking membrane attach - ment and clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCVs ) 1 formation with actin dynamics ( 4 , 14 ) . Recent studies have shown that both HIP1 and HIP12 are enriched on clathrin - coated pits and CCVs and co - localize with markers of endocytosis including clathrin , the clathrin adaptor AP2 and Rab5 ( 4 , 15 – 17 ) . HIP1 binds directly to the terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain through a type I clathrin box with the sequence LMDMD and to the ear domain of the (cid:1) subunit of AP2 ( 15 – 17 ) . Moreover , a fragment of HIP1 containing the clathrin and AP2 - binding sites blocks clathrin - mediated en - docytosis ( 15 , 17 ) . To further characterize the roles of HIP1 and HIP12 in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , we analyzed and compared the protein interaction and functional properties of these two pro - teins . Here , we report that HIP1 strongly associates with CCVs but unlike HIP12 , does not bind directly to F - actin . In contrast , HIP12 does not demonstrate high affinity binding to clathrin and AP2 as seen for HIP1 . However , HIP1 and HIP12 both bind directly to the clathrin light chain through their central helical domain that interestingly , stimulates clathrin assembly . These results suggest related but distinct functions for HIP1 and HIP12 in clathrin - mediated endocytosis and identify a novel interaction with clathrin light chain that appears to contribute to clathrin assembly .

S . A . This paper is available on line at http : / / www . jbc . org 19897 clonal antibodies against the clathrin heavy chain and (cid:1) - adaptin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories . Monoclonal antibody against the clathrin light chain was purchased from Santa Cruz . Mono - clonal antibodies against the FLAG , HA , and His 6 epitopes were pur - chased from Sigma , Roche Molecular Biochemicals , and Qiagen , respectively . DNA Constructs and Recombinant Proteins— Mammalian expression constructs encoding full - length HIP1 and HIP12 and the talin homology domain of HIP1 , each with a FLAG epitope tag at the C terminus , were previously described ( 5 , 15 ) . A construct encoding human full - length HIP12 with a C - terminal HA epitope tag was generated by insertion of a cDNA sequence , 5 (cid:1) - GGAGGTGGATATCCCTATGATGTCCCCGATT - ATGCC , encoding a linker of 3 glycines followed by the HA tag . The integrity of the HA - tagged HIP12 construct was verified by DNA se - quencing . Bacterial fusion proteins encoding His 6 - tagged terminal do - main of the clathrin heavy chain and the amino acids 276 – 335 of HIP1 fused to GST ( GST - HIP1 - ( 276 – 335 ) ) were previously described ( 15 ) . A His 6 - tagged construct encoding full - length clathrin light chain b was generated by subcloning the GFP - clathrin light chain b cDNA ( kindly provided by Dr . Juan Bonifacino ) into the pTrcHisB bacterial expres - sion vector ( Qiagen ) . The following HIP1 and HIP12 GST fusion pro - teins were created by PCR amplification from either full - length HIP1 or HIP12 cDNAs with subsequent cloning into pGEX - 2T or pGEX - 4T vectors ( Amersham Biosciences ) : GST - HIP12 - ( 302 – 348 ) , GST - HIP1 - ( 336 – 610 ) , GST - HIP12 - ( 349 – 644 ) , GST - HIP1 - ( 731 – 1003 ) ( GST - HIP1 - talin ) , and GST - HIP12 - ( 765 – 1068 ) ( GST - HIP12 - talin ) . Pull - down Assays— Rat brains were homogenized in buffer A ( 10 m M HEPES - OH , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 83 m M benzamidine , 0 . 23 m M phenylmethylsul - fonyl fluoride , 0 . 5 (cid:2) g / ml aprotinin , and 0 . 5 (cid:2) g / ml leupeptin ) and the homogenates were centrifuged at 205 , 000 (cid:2) g max for 30 min at 4 °C . The supernatant ( cytosolic extract ) was collected and Triton X - 100 was added to 1 % final concentration . Aliquots of the extract ( 2 mg ) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with GST fusion proteins pre - coupled to glutathione - Sepharose beads . After incubation , samples were washed three times in buffer A containing 1 % Triton X - 100 . For binding exper - iments , purified His 6 - tagged clathrin terminal domain or clathrin light chain b fusion proteins ( 15 (cid:2) g ) in buffer A were incubated overnight at 4 °C with various GST fusion proteins pre - coupled to glutathione - Sepharose beads . After incubation , samples were washed three times in buffer A . In all cases , proteins specifically bound to the beads were eluted with gel sample buffer and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blot . For pull - downs from transfected cells , HeLa cells were grown on 10 - cm 2 dishes and transfected with 6 (cid:2) g of HIP1 or HIP12 cDNA using FuGENE ( Roche Molecular Biochemicals ) . Twenty - four h post - transfec - tion , cells were washed twice with ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and lysed in buffer A ( containing 1 % Triton X - 100 and 10 (cid:2) M Pefa ( Roche Molecular Biochemicals ) . Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with GST fusion proteins pre - coupled to glutathione - Sepharose beads . After incubation , samples were washed three times in buffer A containing 1 % Triton X - 100 and 10 (cid:2) M Pefa . Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis . Immunoprecipitation Assays— HEK - 293T cells were grown on 10 - cm 2 plates and transfected with 4 (cid:2) g of HIP12 cDNA by CaPO 4 (cid:3) pre - cipitation . Transfected and nontransfected cells were washed 24 h post - transfection with ice - cold PBS and lysed in ABL buffer ( 20 m M Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 m M NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 1 % Triton X - 100 ) supple - mented with a 1 : 100 dilution of aprotinin ( Sigma ) , 20 ng / ml leupeptin ( Roche Molecular Biochemicals ) , and 10 (cid:2) M Pefa . The cell lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 245 , 000 (cid:2) g max for 15 min . The supernatants were then incubated for 6 h at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal antibody HIP1 no . 9 pre - bound to protein G - Sepharose ( Amersham Biosciences ) . Subse - quently , samples were washed 6 times in ABL buffer and specifically bound proteins were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blot . Immunofluorescence— Cells were plated onto gelatinized glass slides in 6 - well tissue culture plates and transfected with 1 (cid:2) g of HIP1 or HIP12 cDNA . Twenty - four h post - transfection , the cells were washed in PBS , fixed in PBS containing 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature , and permeabilized in PBS containing 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 and 1 % paraformaldehyde for 5 min . The cells were then incubated in PBS containing 3 % normal goat serum for 30 min to block nonspecific binding . Depending on the experiment , the cells were then incubated with monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG or HA epitopes for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with a polyclonal antibody against HIP1 , followed by a 1 - h incubation at room temperature with appropriate secondary antibodies in PBS containing 2 % normal goat serum . Staining of the actin cytoskeleton was achieved by incubation with Texas Red - phalloidin . Cells were then extensively washed in PBS , mounted , and observed on a BioRad Radiance Plus confocal microscope ( BioRad , Hercules , CA ) using Laser Sharp software ( BioRad ) . Actin - binding Assays— Purified human non - muscle monomeric actin ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) was polymerized as described previously ( 4 ) and incubated with purified GST - HIP1 - talin and GST - HIP12 - talin ( 20 (cid:2) g each ) for 1 h at room temperature in a final volume of 50 (cid:2) l . The samples were then centrifuged for 30 min at 362 , 000 (cid:2) g max . Protein components of the pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS - PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining . Gels were scanned on a ScanJet 6300 ( Hewlett Packard ) and protein amounts were determined using Quantity One ( Bio - Rad ) software . Statistical analysis was done by the Student’s t test . Clathrin Purification and Clathrin Assembly Assays— CCVs were purified from adult rat brains as described ( 18 ) . To purify clathrin , coats were stripped from the vesicles by incubation in buffer B ( 0 . 5 M Tris , pH 7 . 0 , 2 m M EDTA , 0 . 83 m M benzamidine , 0 . 23 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 0 . 5 (cid:2) g / ml aprotinin , and 0 . 5 (cid:2) g / ml leupeptin ) for 15 min on ice . The samples were then centrifuged for 15 min at 245 , 000 (cid:2) g max with the purified coat fraction remaining in the supernatant . The stripping and centrifugation steps were repeated a second time and the superna - tants were pooled . The pooled supernatants were loaded onto a contin - uous 5 – 20 % sucrose gradient made in buffer B and then centrifuged for 3 . 5 h at 195 , 000 (cid:2) g max in a Sorvall Step Saver vertical rotor . Fractions of 2 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining . Peak clathrin fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight in clathrin assembly buffer ( 10 m M Tris - Cl , pH 8 . 5 ) and subsequently used for clathrin assembly assays . Clathrin assembly assays were performed with 0 . 5 (cid:2) M purified clath - rin and different concentrations ( 0 . 12 – 2 (cid:2) M ) of fusion proteins in a final volume of 90 (cid:2) l of clathrin assembly buffer . Assembly was initiated at 4 °C by addition of 10 (cid:2) l of 1 M MES , pH 6 . 7 . The mixture was kept on ice for 45 min and then centrifuged at 400 , 000 (cid:2) g max for 6 min . The supernatant ( 80 (cid:2) l ) was loaded on a SDS - PAGE and the clathrin as - sembly was quantified by Coomassie Blue staining . RESULTS HIP1 and HIP12 Are Abundant Coat Proteins of CCVs of Adult and Embryonic Rat Brains— Both HIP1 and HIP12 have been implicated in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 4 , 15 – 17 , 19 ) . To further characterize the endocytic functions of these proteins , we sought to directly compare their biochemical and functional properties . Both HIP1 and HIP12 are predomi - nantly expressed in brain ( 1 , 2 ) . Within brain , however , the two proteins demonstrate distinct developmental expression pro - files ( Fig . 1 A ) . Specifically , HIP1 is most highly expressed during early development , with the highest detectable levels at embryonic day 13 ( E13 ) and E16 , whereas HIP12 expression is only weakly detectable at E13 through E18 but increases in postnatal day 2 rats with high levels of expression in adult brain ( Fig . 1 A ) . Interestingly , both HIP1 and HIP12 are highly enriched on the coats that are stripped from purified CCVs prepared from E18 brains ( data not shown ) and adult brains ( Fig . 1 B ) . HIP1 and HIP12 show a comparable enrichment in the CCV fractions to both each other and to the coat proteins clathrin and AP2 ( data not shown and Fig . 1 B ) . Moreover , both proteins appear to be major components of the clathrin coats ( Fig . 1 C ) . To make this determination , coat proteins stripped from adult or E18 CCVs where fractionated on linear 5 – 20 % sucrose gradients , which readily separated HIP1 and HIP12 from the large subunits of the adpatin complexes ( Fig . 1 C ) . Coomassie Blue staining of the fractions revealed that HIP1 and HIP12 where present on E18 or adult rat brain CCVs , respectively , at near stoichiometric levels with adaptin sub - units ( Fig . 1 C ) . HIP1 and HIP12 Co - localize and Interact— Earlier work in our laboratory has shown that HIP1 and HIP12 interact in the yeast two - hybrid system ( 5 ) . To confirm this interaction , co - immunoprecipitation studies were performed in HEK - 293T cells . Immunoprecipitation of endogenous HIP1 with a mono - clonal antibody led to co - immunoprecipitation of endogenous HIP12 whereas no precipitation of HIP12 was seen in the Huntingtin - interacting Proteins in Endocytosis 19898 absence of HIP1 antibody ( Fig . 2 A ) . Transfection of the cells with HIP12 cDNA led to a significantly greater immunopre - cipitation of HIP12 by endogenous HIP1 ( Fig . 2 A ) . We next analyzed the intracellular localization of HIP1 and HIP12 in neuronal NT2 cells following transfection of HA - tagged HIP12 . Confocal microscopy analysis of the expression of HIP12 - HA shows punctate staining throughout the cell and extensive co - localization with endogenous HIP1 ( Fig . 2 B ) . These punctae correspond predominantly to clathrin - coated pits and CCVs as previously described ( 4 , 15 ) . F IG . 1 . HIP1 and HIP12 are coat proteins of CCVs and display distinct developmental expression profiles . A , post - nuclear superna - tants ( 100 (cid:2) g ) from brain extracts of various rat developmental stages were analyzed by Western blot with anti - HIP1 or anti - HIP12 antibodies as indicated . E , embryonic day ; P , post - natal day ; A , adult . B , purified CCVs were obtained by subcellular fractionation of adult rat brain homogenates . Aliquots ( 100 (cid:2) g ) of the various fractions were analyzed by Western blot with antibodies against clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) , the (cid:1) - adaptin subunit of AP2 ( AP2 ) , HIP1 and HIP12 , as indicated . H , homogenate ; P , pellet ; S , supernatant ; SGp , sucrose gradient pellet ; SGs , sucrose gradient supernatant ; C , coats ; V , vesicles . The coats and vesicles correspond to the supernatant and pellet fractions , respectively , following incubation of the purified CCVs with 0 . 5 M Tris , pH 9 . 0 . C , purified CCVs from adult and E18 brains were stripped of their coats in 0 . 5 M Tris , pH 7 . 0 , 2 m M EDTA . Aliquots of the coat fractions were analyzed on SDS - PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining ( panels at left ) . The coat proteins were then fractionated on continuous 5 – 20 % sucrose gradients . The gradients were collected in 20 equal fractions and aliquots from fractions 7 – 18 were analyzed by SDS - PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining ( Coomassie ) . The migration of HIP1 and HIP12 was determined by Western blot as indicated . The bracket on the E18 gradient demonstrates the migratory positions of the large subunits of the adaptins , whereas the arrow indicates the migratory position of HIP1 . Huntingtin - interacting Proteins in Endocytosis 19899 To determine the regions of HIP1 and HIP12 that mediate their interaction , pull - down experiments were performed . Pre - vious studies have shown that a small fragment of HIP12 encompassing the helical domain interacts with HIP1 in the yeast two - hybrid system ( 5 ) . Therefore , we analyzed whether HIP1 and HIP12 interact through their helical domains . In fact , the helical domains of both HIP1 and HIP12 are sufficient to specifically pull - down HIP12 and HIP1 , respectively ( Fig . 2 C ) . These studies suggest that the HIP1 - HIP12 interaction could affect specific functions of each protein . HIP1 and HIP12 Display Differential Binding to Clathrin and AP2— Between its ENTH and helical domains , HIP1 con - tains a clathrin - box consensus sequence , LMDMD , which binds to the terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain ( 15 ) . This sequence is found in close association with the sequences FDNKF , FDDIF , FGSSF , and DPF , which match consensus sequences for binding to AP2 ( 17 ) . Upon sequence alignment , the LMDMD motif in HIP1 aligns with the sequence LIEIS in HIP12 ( Fig . 3 A ) . The LIEIS sequence resembles a clathrin - box motif similar to that found in the clathrin - binding proteins ACK1 and ACK2 ( 20 , 21 ) . In contrast , the DPF motif is absent from HIP12 and the FDNKF , FDDIF , and FGSSF sequences , which match the consensus F X ( N / D / S ) X ( F / L ) ( 17 ) , are not con - served ( Fig . 3 A ) . We thus designed a HIP1 - GST fusion protein , GST - HIP1 - ( 276 – 335 ) , encompassing these sites ( Fig . 3 B ) and tested for its ability to bind clathrin and AP2 in comparison with a GST fusion protein encoding the corresponding region of HIP12 , GST - HIP12 - ( 302 – 348 ) . As previously demonstrated ( 15 ) , GST - HIP1 - ( 276 – 335 ) binds strongly to clathrin ( Fig . 3 C , top panel ) . In contrast , GST - HIP12 - ( 302 – 348 ) demonstrates much weaker clathrin binding ( Fig . 3 C , top panel ) . In both cases , the binding is mediated through the terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain ( 15 ) ( data not shown ) . Moreover , GST - HIP1 - ( 276 – 335 ) binds strongly to AP2 whereas no binding of GST - HIP12 - ( 302 – 348 ) to AP2 was detected ( Fig . 3 C , bottom panel ) . In Contrast to HIP12 , HIP1 Does Not Bind Actin— HIP12 binds actin through its talin - homology domain ( 4 ) . To deter - mine whether the talin homology domain of HIP1 also medi - ates actin binding , a GST - HIP1 - talin homology domain fusion protein was analyzed for co - sedimentation with F - actin . As a control , the talin homology domain of HIP12 was expressed as a GST fusion protein and analyzed in parallel . Surprisingly , in contrast to HIP12 , HIP1 bind only very weakly to actin in vitro ( Fig . 4 A ) . Specifically , in the presence of 5 (cid:2) M F - actin , 87 . 6 % (cid:4) 6 . 0 ( mean (cid:4) S . E . , n (cid:5) 3 ) of GST - HIP12 - talin homology domain was bound to F - actin . In contrast , only 19 . 3 % (cid:4) 3 . 7 ( mean (cid:4) S . E . , n (cid:5) 3 ) of the GST - HIP1 - talin homology domain was bound to the same amount of polymerized actin ( Fig . 4 B ) . A number of different parameters such as pH and ion concentrations were tested for their potential effect on the binding of HIP1 - talin to actin . However , none of these alterations allowed for increased binding ( data not shown ) . Consistent with this observation is the lack of co - localization between the HIP1 - talin homology domain and the cortical actin cytoskeleton following overex - pression of HIP1 - talin in cultured cells ( Fig . 4 C ) . This is in contrast to the observation that the talin homology domain of HIP12 shows enrichment along cortical actin filaments ( 4 ) . HIP1 and HIP12 Contain a Second Clathrin - binding Site in Their Helical Domain— We previously demonstrated that GST - F IG . 2 . HIP1 and HIP12 interact via their helical domains . A , HEK 293T cells were transfected with full - length HIP12 cDNA ( HIP12 ) or were left untransfected ( (cid:3) ) . Cell lysates were prepared and immu - noprecipitations were carried out in the presence or absence ( (cid:3) AB ) of mouse mAb HIP1 # 9 . Cell lysate ( SM ) and immunoprecipitated protein ( IP ) were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blot with anti - HIP12FP antibody . B , co - localization of transfected HIP12 - HA ( red ) and endoge - nous HIP1 ( green ) was analyzed in neuronal NT2 cells . Overlays of the images are shown in the panel on the right ( overlay ) . Scale bar (cid:5) 10 (cid:2) M . C , HeLa cells were transfected with either HIP1 or HIP12 full - length cDNA as indicated . Cell extracts were prepared and tested for binding to GST alone or various HIP12 and HIP1 GST fusion proteins . Equal volumes of unbound and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blot with anti - HIP1 and anti - HIP12 antibodies as indicated . F IG . 3 .

B , schematic rep - resentation of various GST fusion proteins used for the binding assays . C , soluble proteins from brain extracts were affinity purified with equal amounts of HIP1 or HIP12 - GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione - Sepharose beads . Proteins specifically bound to the beads were ana - lyzed by Western blot with antibodies against CHC or the (cid:1) - adaptin subunit of AP2 ( AP2 ) as indicated . Huntingtin - interacting Proteins in Endocytosis 19900 HIP1 - ( 219 – 616 ) , encompassing the clathrin box motif and the helical domain , demonstrated stronger binding to clathrin than GST - HIP1 - ( 276 – 335 ) alone , encompassing only the clathrin box consensus site ( 15 ) . This observation led us to suggest the presence of a second clathrin - binding site in the helical domain of HIP1 ( 15 ) . Moreover , the helical domains of HIP1 and HIP12 were recently reported to mediate binding to clathrin ( 16 , 19 ) . We thus designed fusion proteins encompassing the helical domains of HIP1 , GST - HIP1 - ( 336 – 610 ) and HIP12 , GST - HIP12 - ( 349 – 644 ) ( Fig . 5 A ) and tested their ability to bind clathrin and AP2 . Both fusion proteins show specific binding to clathrin from brain extracts ( Fig . 5 B , top panel ) but not to AP2 ( Fig . 5 B , bottom panel ) . HIP1 and HIP12 Promote Clathrin Assembly through Their Helical Domains— Full - length HIP12 stimulates clathrin as - sembly ( 19 ) . Moreover , both HIP1 and HIP12 contain a DLL motif in their helical domains that contributes to the clathrin assembly activity of other clathrin adaptor proteins ( 22 ) . We thus tested the ability of both of the helical domains to promote clathrin assembly in vitro . Interestingly , both GST - HIP1 - ( 336 – 610 ) and GST - HIP12 - ( 348 – 644 ) fusion proteins stimulated clathrin assembly in a dose - dependent manner with full activ - ity detected in the presence of 0 . 5 (cid:2) M fusion protein ( Fig . 6 ) . In contrast , GST alone did not stimulate clathrin assembly ( Fig . 6 ) . These results demonstrate that like HIP12 ( 19 ) , HIP1 stim - ulates clathrin assembly , and that for both proteins , assembly activity is localized to their helical domains , which demon - strate weak clathrin binding . HIP1 and HIP12 Bind Directly to Clathrin Light Chain— Inspection of the helical domains of HIP1 and HIP12 failed to reveal any type I or type II clathrin box sequences ( 23 ) that could mediate interactions with the terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain . This suggested the possibility of a novel form of clathrin interaction mediated by the helical domains . To explore this further , we performed additional binding as - says with GST - HIP1 - ( 336 – 610 ) and GST - HIP12 - ( 348 – 644 ) . Consistent with the lack of consensus clathrin terminal do - main - binding sites , neither helical domain fusion protein bound to purified His 6 - tagged clathrin terminal domain ( Fig . 7 A , bottom panel ) , whereas the same fusion proteins bound to clathrin heavy chain from brain extracts ( Fig . 7 A , top panel ) . Clathrin exists in the cytosol of cells as a triskelia , in which three molecules of clathrin heavy chain are associated with three molecules of clathrin light chain ( 24 ) . Thus , it is possible that the helical domain fusion proteins bind to clathrin light chain leading to an indirect interaction with the heavy chain . This idea is supported by the recent observation that addition of light chains to truncated clathrin cages restores their ability to bind HIP12 ( 19 ) . To directly test if the helical domains of HIP1 and HIP12 bind to clathrin light chain , we generated a His 6 - tagged fusion protein encoding full - length clathrin light chain b . Interestingly , this purified fusion protein bound strongly to the HIP1 and HIP12 helical domain GST fusion proteins ( Fig . 7 B ) . Taken together , these studies demonstrate that the helical domains of HIP1 and HIP12 do not interact with the clathrin heavy chain via its terminal domain , al - though we cannot rule out the possibility that they could in - teract with the proximal or distal legs of the heavy chain . In contrast , HIP1 and HIP12 bind directly to the clathrin light chain through the helical domains , which also stimulate clath - rin assembly . F IG . 4 . HIP1 does not bind actin in contrast to HIP12 . A , binding of the HIP1 - talin homology domain expressed as a GST fusion protein ( HIP1 - talin ) to filamentous actin was analyzed by cosedimentation in the presence of various concentrations of assembled actin ( 0 – 10 (cid:2) M ) . Binding of the HIP12 - talin homology domain GST fusion protein ( HIP12 - talin ) was used as positive control . The arrows indicate HIP1 or HIP12 fusion proteins in the supernatant ( S ) and pellet ( P ) fractions . B , the percentage of GST - HIP1 - talin bound to actin is shown as mean (cid:4) S .

Huntingtin - interacting Proteins in Endocytosis 19901 DISCUSSION Many proteins involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis harbor a facet of protein interaction modules that enable them to function in the recruitment of clathrin triskelia to sites of endocytosis and in the subsequent formation of CCVs , shedding of coat proteins , and intracellular transport of the uncoated vesicle ( 25 , 26 ) . In the present work , we show that two family members , HIP1 and HIP12 , are major components of CCVs . As such , they are comparable in their enrichment on purified vesicles to the coat proteins (cid:1) - adaptin , clathrin , and AP180 . In contrast , accessory proteins of clathrin - mediated endocytosis such as dynamin , synaptojanin , amphiphysin I and II , epsin , endophilin , and Eps15 are far less enriched on CCVs ( 27 ) . Moreover , HIP1 and HIP12 are present on CCVs at near stoi - chiometric levels with the adaptor proteins . Finally , both pro - teins can be stripped from purified vesicles by treatment with Tris buffer , which is well established to remove coat compo - nents from vesicles ( 28 ) . Thus , HIP1 and HIP12 should be considered as novel members of the clathrin coat . Several endocytic accessory proteins that participate in the formation of clathrin - coated pits and CCVs contain a tandem arrangement of high affinity clathrin and AP2 consensus - bind - ing sites including amphiphysin I ( 29 ) , epsin ( 30 ) , and arrestins ( 31 ) . This tandem arrangement of consensus sites is also found in HIP1 but is not conserved in the HIP1 family member HIP12 . HIP12 does not contain the DPF / W or FX ( N / D / S ) X ( F / L ) consensus AP2 - binding sites ( 17 , 32 , 33 ) and correspondingly does not show binding to AP2 . Moreover , the clathrin box motif that is present in HIP12 binds clathrin with rather low affinity . Since the tandem arrangement of clathrin - and AP2 - binding sites is thought to stabilize clathrin / adaptor interactions ( 30 ) , HIP12 probably contributes less to the stabilization of this F IG . 6 . HIP1 and HIP12 promote clathrin assembly through their helical domains . An aliquot of the purified clathrin used as a starting material ( SM ) for the clathrin assembly assays was resolved on SDS - PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue . Clathrin assembly as - says were performed with increasing amounts of fusion proteins GST , GST - HIP1 - ( 336 – 610 ) , and GST - HIP12 - ( 348 – 644 ) as indicated . The GST fusion proteins and the clathrin remaining in the supernatant after high - speed centrifugation following initiation of clathrin assembly were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining . F IG . 7 . HIP1 and HIP12 bind directly to the clathrin light chain through their helical domains . A , soluble proteins from brain extracts or purified His 6 - tagged clathrin terminal domain ( TD ) fusion protein were affinity purified with equal amounts of HIP1 or HIP12 GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione - Sepharose beads . Proteins specifically bound to the beads were analyzed by Western blots with antibodies against CHC or the His epitope ( tetra - HIS ) as indicated . B , purified His 6 - tagged clathrin light chain b ( LCb ) fusion protein was affinity purified with equal amounts of HIP1 or HIP12 GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione - Sepharose beads . Proteins specifically bound to the beads were analyzed by Western blot with the anti - His epitope antibody ( tetra - HIS ) . Huntingtin - interacting Proteins in Endocytosis 19902 protein complex . As such , HIP12 is comparable with amphiphy - sin II that interacts with clathrin through type I and type II clathrin box sequences but does not bind to AP2 ( 34 , 35 ) . The formation of clathrin - coated pits does not occur ran - domly . Instead , defined sites of endocytosis exist that are de - marcated by AP2 ( 36 ) with extended areas of the membrane not being involved in coated pit formation ( 37 ) . It has been pro - posed that the underlying membrane cytoskeleton contains coated pit - nucleation sites and that actin may be involved in the spatial organization of endocytic components at the mem - brane ( 37 , 38 ) . Interestingly , both HIP1 and HIP12 contain an ENTH domain , a PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding motif that is found in several other coat and accessory proteins including AP180 and epsins ( 11 , 12 ) . Recent studies have demonstrated that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is localized predominantly on the plasma mem - brane of quiescent neurons but that its levels are increased on endocytic membranes following stimulation of endocytic activ - ity ( 39 ) . In addition to potential PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding , HIP1 and HIP12 contain a talin homology domain that in HIP12 binds directly to actin ( 4 ) . Thus , it is intriguing to speculate that HIP1 and HIP12 may play a role in the coordination of clathrin , actin , and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 functions at the plasma membrane to demarcate sites of clathrin assembly . Surpris - ingly , however , HIP1 does not bind to actin . This appears to result from the observation that a helical segment at the N terminus of the talin homology domain of HIP1 can disrupt actin binding through an intrasteric interaction ( 40 ) . Neverthe - less , heterodimerization of HIP1 and HIP12 may be a mecha - nism that allows HIP1 to indirectly bind to F - actin and that also allows AP2 to be recruited to clathrin nucleation sites defined by the HIP proteins at the plasma membrane . Consistent with a role for the HIP1 - HIP12 complex in defin - ing endocytic active zones , HIP12 has been demonstrated to stimulate clathrin assembly ( 19 ) . Here , we have determined that HIP1 also functions in clathrin assembly and that for both proteins assembly activity is localized to the helical domain . GST fusion proteins encoding the helical domains of HIP1 and HIP12 are also able to affinity purify clathrin triskelia from brain extracts . Interestingly , the helical domains do not bind to the terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain but do bind directly to the clathrin light chain , consistent with recent re - sults demonstrating that light chains are necessary for HIP12 binding to clathrin hub domains ( 19 ) . Clathrin triskelia , com - posed of three heavy chains , each with a bound light chain , assemble into a polyhedral lattice at physiological pH only in the presence of assembly proteins such as AP2 or AP180 . In - terestingly , it has been proposed that the light chains interact with the distal legs of the clathrin heavy chains to prevent clathrin assembly ( 41 ) . Specifically , the recombinant hub frag - ments of the clathrin heavy chains assemble in the absence of light chains at physiological pH whereas addition of purified light chains blocks the assembly reaction ( 41 ) . Moreover , Src - dependent phosphorylation of the clathrin heavy chain at ty - rosine 1477 , a site that appears to be involved in binding to light chain , stimulates clathrin assembly , possibly by releasing the inhibitory effect of the light chain ( 42 ) . Thus , HIP1 and HIP12 may stimulate clathrin assembly by interacting with the clathrin light chain and through an unknown mechanism re - lease light chain - mediated inhibition allowing the heavy chains to interact and assemble ( 41 ) . This model is consistent with the observation that overexpression of HIP12 in cultured cells causes a mislocalization of the light chains without a major effect on the distribution of the heavy chains ( 19 ) . HIP1 and HIP12 are the first assembly proteins demonstrated to interact directly with clathrin light chain and this interaction appears to reveal a novel mechanism involved in the regulation of clathrin assembly . Growing evidence suggests a role for the disease - associated protein huntingtin in clathrin - mediated endocytosis and intra - cellular vesicle transport . For example , huntingtin associates with the (cid:1) - adaptin C subunit of the AP2 complex ( 43 ) and with endophilin A3 ( 44 ) and it associates with vesicles and microtu - bules ( 44 – 47 ) . The interaction of huntingtin with AP2 and endophilin suggests that huntingtin participates in the com - plex network of interactions regulating clathrin - mediated en - docytosis and vesicle recycling . Huntingtin has been localized to endosomal and lysosomal membranes ( 48 ) and it is present but not enriched on purified CCVs ( 46 ) ( data not shown ) . In - triguingly , the interaction of HIP1 with huntingtin is directly modulated by polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin , suggest - ing that disturbances in protein interaction and subsequent alterations in clathrin - mediated endocytosis could contribute to the pathogenesis of Huntington disease .
