Ion Channels and Their Functional Role in Vascular Endothelium . Physiol Rev 81 : 1415 – 1459 , 2001 . —Endothelial cells ( EC ) form a unique signal - transducing surface in the vascular system . The abundance of ion channels in the plasma membrane of these nonexcitable cells has raised questions about their functional role . This review presents evidence for the involvement of ion channels in endothelial cell functions controlled by intracellular Ca 2 1 signals , such as the production and release of many vasoactive factors , e . g . , nitric oxide and PGI 2 . In addition , ion channels may be involved in the regulation of the trafﬁc of macromolecules by endocytosis , transcytosis , the biosynthetic - secretory pathway , and exocytosis , e . g . , tissue factor pathway inhibitor , von Willebrand factor , and tissue plasminogen activator . Ion channels are also involved in controlling intercellular permeability , EC proliferation , and angiogenesis . These functions are supported or triggered via ion channels , which either provide Ca 2 1 - entry pathways or stabilize the driving force for Ca 2 1 inﬂux through these pathways . These Ca 2 1 - entry pathways comprise agonist - activated nonselec - tive Ca 2 1 - permeable cation channels , cyclic nucleotide - activated nonselective cation channels , and store - operated Ca 2 1 channels or capacitative Ca 2 1 entry . At least some of these channels appear to be expressed by genes of the trp family . The driving force for Ca 2 1 entry is mainly controlled by large - conductance Ca 2 1 - dependent BK Ca channels ( slo ) , inwardly rectifying K 1 channels ( Kir2 . 1 ) , and at least two types of Cl 2 channels , i . e . , the Ca 2 1 - activated Cl 2 channel and the housekeeping , volume - regulated anion channel ( VRAC ) . In addition to their essential function in Ca 2 1 signaling , VRAC channels are multifunctional , operate as a transport pathway for amino acids and organic osmolytes , and are possibly involved in endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis . Finally , we have also highlighted the role of ion channels as mechanosensors in EC . Plasmalemmal ion channels may signal rapid changes in hemodynamic forces , such as shear stress and biaxial tensile stress , but also changes in cell shape and cell volume to the cytoskeleton and the intracellular machinery for metabolite trafﬁc and gene expression .

INTRODUCTION Endothelial cells ( EC ) form a multifunctional signal - transducing surface that performs different tasks depen - dent on its localization in the vessel tree . Arterial EC provide a pathway for delivery of oxygen from blood to tissue . They modulate the tone of vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSM ) , which in turn controls blood pressure and blood ﬂow by adjusting the caliber of arteries and arte - rioles . In the microvascular bed , EC regulate the perme - ation of various metabolites , macromolecules and gases , as well as autocrine and paracrine factors and are in - volved in the regulation of cell nutrition . In all vessel types , EC are involved in blood coagulation , control of the transport between blood and tissue , movement of cells adhering to EC , wound healing , and angiogenesis . Several of these functions depend on constitutive properties of EC , e . g . , presenting an anticoagulative surface for blood ﬂow by secreting heparin sulfates and expressing ecto - nucleotidases and thrombomodulin ( 32 , 33 , 273 , 295 ) . Other functions require an active response of EC to var - ious signals of mechanical , chemical , or neuronal nature . These signals originate from the blood or tissue side of EC or from a coupling with other cells , such as neighboring EC and adhering cells such as white blood cells and thrombocytes , but also with cells at the abluminal side , e . g . , smooth muscle cells , mast cells , and ﬁbroblasts . This signal transduction is impaired during vessel disease ( ar - teriosclerosis ) and injury , inﬂammation , or hemodynamic disturbances ( hypertension ) . The role of ion channels in the transduction of these signals into cellular responses is still a matter of debate and has received substantial attention only in the last few years . Ion channels are mainly involved in “short - term responses” ( in the second and minute range ) and affect the synthesis or release of pro - and anticoagulants , growth factors , and the release of vasomotor regulators . Some of these compounds are produced “on demand” [ nitric oxide ( NO ) , PGI 2 , and platelet activating factor ( PAF ) ] , and others are released by exocytosis from stor - age granules [ tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , tissue factor pathway inhibitor ( TFPI ) , von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) ] in response to various transmitters , such as ace - tylcholine , histamine , kinins ( bradykinin ) , angiotensin , ATP , ADP , the coagulation factor thrombin , growth fac - tors , but also in response to mechanical stimuli , such as shear stress and biaxial tensile stress . Fast responses related to the regulation of the permeability of the blood - tissue interface , controlled by changes in the contractile state of EC and their ability to modulate cell - cell contacts are also controlled by ion channels . The “slow responses” consist in the expression of several surface molecules , adhesion molecules , gene expression , cytoskeletal changes , remodeling , endothelial cell growth , and angiogenesis . This review addresses the diversity of ion channels and their functional role in EC . Our current knowledge is limited to effects of ion channels on fast endothelial re - sponses , these channels being mainly essential for the regulation of Ca 2 1 signaling . The major part of the review is therefore devoted to ion channels that function as pathways for Ca 2 1 entry . These channels are mainly re - sponsible for a long - lasting increase in the free intracel - lular Ca 2 1 concentration ( [ Ca 2 1 ] i ) during various types of stimuli . This Ca 2 1 entry is given by J Ca 5 2 z F z N z p z g Ca z ~ V M 2 E Ca ! ( 1 ) where J Ca is the Ca 2 1 inﬂux , F is the Faraday constant , and N is the number of channels . The open probability p of the channel and its conductance g Ca for Ca 2 1 represent inherent features of Ca 2 1 entry channels , which are dis - cussed in the ﬁrst part of this review . In addition , Ca 2 1 entry is regulated by the driving force for Ca 2 1 , i . e . , the difference between membrane potential ( V M ) and equilib - rium potential for Ca 2 1 ( E Ca ) . Thus Ca 2 1 entry will be tuned by channels that modulate electrogenesis in EC , which will be discussed in the second part of the review . Figure 1 illustrates the dual function of ion channels on Ca 2 1 entry in EC . Agonist stimulation induces in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 1 only a fast release of intra - cellular Ca 2 1 , which is accompanied by a transient hyper - polarization . In the presence of extracellular Ca 2 1 how - ever , it also induces a plateaulike phase of [ Ca 2 1 ] i due to Ca 2 1 entry which leads membrane hyperpolarization and an increased driving force for Ca 2 1 inﬂux . Figure 1 gives also an overview of the most important channels in EC that are likely responsible for Ca 2 1 entry and modulation of membrane potential . The third part of this review discusses endothelial functions in which ion channels are likely involved . II . VARIABILITY OF ION CHANNEL EXPRESSION IN ENDOTHELIAL CELLS EC express a bewildering variety of ion channels . Unfortunately , it is not clear which channels may be of functional impact in the vascular tree in vivo because some of these channels have only been detected in cul - tured endothelial cell lines or in primary cultured cells , others in cells obtained by diverse cell dispersion meth - ods , and only very few from in situ measurements in blood vessels . It is therefore not surprising that the ex - tensive amount of data on channel physiology in EC is sometimes controversial and often questionable with re - gard to their physiological signiﬁcance . In the future , it might therefore be necessary to identify the candidate channel in vivo . An elegant method to identify channels in 1416 BERND NILIUS AND GUY DROOGMANS Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m endothelium by cell - speciﬁc single cell RT - PCR has been published recently ( 337 ) . Another problem typical for EC is that ion channels in EC adapt their appearance to the external conditions . Apparently , ion channels or generally gene expression in EC are highly malleable and vary with cell isolation , cul - ture , and growth conditions ( 136 ) . As a striking example , human capillary EC grown in normal medium show TEA - sensitive outwardly rectifying K 1 currents and inwardly rectifying K 1 channels ( IRK ) , but when grown in a “con - ditioned medium” ( low cell density , medium changed only during passages at days 5 – 6 compared with controls in which the medium was changed every second day ) ex - pressed different channels , such as slo BK Ca or 4 - amino - pyridine - sensitive A channels ( 173 ) . The quantitative fea - tures of volume - regulated anion currents in primary explants of EC are different , i . e . , activation during cell swelling is delayed and inactivation at positive potentials is accelerated as compared with cultured EC ( 381 ) . The expression of IRK channels in freshly isolated human umbilical vein EC ( HUVEC ) changes with the number of passages ( 290 ) . The loss of different serpentine receptors in EC during culturing is well documented ( 389 ) . Likely , EC might be especially predisposed for this variability . FIG . 1 . Dual function of ion channels for Ca 2 1 entry in endothelial cells . Simultaneous recordings of intracellular Ca 2 1 concentration ( [ Ca 2 1 ] i ) and membrane potential ( V M ) in a freshly isolated mouse aorta endothelial cell in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca 2 1 . Note the fast Ca 2 1 peak followed by a long - lasting plateau , which disappears after washing out the agonist ( 10 m M ACh , 37°C ) . This plateau is absent when extracellular Ca 2 1 is removed . Thus the functionally important plateau phase is mediated by Ca 2 1 entry . The increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i is accompanied by a hyperpo - larization , which is maintained during the plateau phase , but transient in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 1 ( [ Ca 2 1 ] ext ) . This hyperpolarization stabilizes the driving force for Ca 2 1 entry , V M 2 E Ca ( see text ) . Candidates for the Ca 2 1 entry pathway are listed at the right together with channels that mainly control the driving force for Ca 2 1 entry ( see text for further explanation ) .

ION CHANNELS IN VASCULAR ENDOTHELIUM 1417 Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m EC also show regional heterogeneity , including dif - ferences in [ Ca 2 1 ] i signaling , in immunological and met - abolic properties , and in the pattern of released mediators for endothelium - dependent vasorelaxation ( 202 , 245 , 273 , 386 , 393 ) . The uncertainty as to which types of ion channels are present in a vessel type under physiological conditions is a complicating factor for a comprehension of ion channel function in EC . III . CALCIUM ENTRY CHANNELS Their role in Ca 2 1 signaling is obviously a fundamental aspect of ion channels in EC . We therefore ﬁrst describe the various inﬂux routes of Ca 2 1 in EC . Electrophysiological properties of the presently known endothelial Ca 2 1 entry pathways are summarized in Table 1 . A . Nonselective Cation Channels Nonselective cation channels ( NSC ) poorly discrimi - nating between cations have been detected in several ion channel families . There was so far no compelling evi - dence for the existence of NSC members of the purinergic ligand - gated receptor - channel complexes ( the P 2X family ) in EC , but very recently P2X4 receptors have been iden - tiﬁed in several macrovascular primary cultured EC ( 448 ) . This receptor , which is involved in ATP and shear stress induced Ca 2 1 inﬂux ( 447 ) , seems to be part of a far more complex Ca 2 1 entry system , because the ATP - induced Ca 2 1 entry still persists in HUVECs treated with antisense P2X4 . NSCs belonging to the mammalian degenerins ( MDEG ) family are apparently not expressed in EC . 1 . Receptor - activated cation channels Various functionally different receptor - activated cat - ion channels ( RACCs ) , gated by binding of agonists to their membrane receptor , have been described in EC ( 123 , 172 , 177 , 291 , 295 ) . Most of these channels are activated via signaling cascades involving activation of phospho - lipase C ( PLC ) , but it is not clear which second messen - gers are involved . Interestingly , TRP3 and - 6 , which are members of the family of six transmembrane helix chan - nels ( STRPC , see below ) that are present in endothelium ( 98 ) , are nonselective RACCs ( 132 ) . Probably , TRP4 and - 5 are also nonselective RACCs ( 357 ) , although it has been shown that TRP4 might be at least part of a more Ca 2 1 - selective , store - operated channel ( 99 ) . Endothelial RACCs , activated by an increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i , are also permeable for Ca 2 1 and provide a Ca 2 1 - entry route that exerts a positive feedback on their own activation . Their molecular struc - ture is not known , although members of the TRP family with Ca 2 1 - calmodulin binding sites in their primary struc - ture ( see sect . III C ) are possible candidates . Ca 2 1 - permeable NSC activated by vasoactive ago - nists , which have been already described in freshly iso - lated cells from umbilical vein ( 270 , 271 , 276 , 289 , 291 ) , have recently been characterized in more detail in cul - tured cell lines . The channel has a conductance of ; 25 pS and is permeable for Na 1 , Cs 1 , and Ca 2 1 with a perme - ation ratio P Ca : P Na that varies between 0 . 03 and 2 ( 172 , 177 , 267 , 272 , 296 ) . The current slowly activates during agonist stimulation and has been observed only in the presence of physiological [ Ca 2 1 ] i . Buffering of [ Ca 2 1 ] i with 10 mM BAPTA completely prevents current activa - tion . On the other hand , loading the cells with Ca 2 1 via the patch pipette does not activate the current . Interestingly , application of a store - depleting inhibitor of sarco / endo - plasmic reticulum Ca 2 1 - ATPase ( SERCA ) pumps , such as tert - butyl - benzohydroquinone ( tBHQ ) or thapsigargin ( TG ) , can also activate this NSC . The inﬂux of Ca 2 1 through this NSC is coupled to agonist stimulation and depends on inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate [ Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ] pro - duction . Block of PLC with the pyrrole - dione derivative U73122 rapidly inhibits Ca 2 1 inﬂux , whereas the pyrroli - dine - dione derivative U73343 , which does not inhibit PLC , is ineffective . Also 5 - nitro - 2 - ( 3 - phenylpropylamino ) ben - zoic acid ( NPPB ) , Ni 2 1 , ecanozole , and SKF - 96365 inhibit the agonist - induced Ca 2 1 entry ( 177 ) . This channel shares some properties with the hTRP3 channels expressed in EC that do not express this NSC ( 178 ) . Baron et al . ( 13 ) described another nonselective Ca 2 1 - permeable cation channel , activated by intracellular Ca 2 1 and with a con - TABLE 1 . STRP channels in EC Type Tissue Reference No .

This channel , with a permeability ratio P Ca : P Na of 0 . 7 , is half - maximally activated at 0 . 7 m M [ Ca 2 1 ] i . A nonselective , agonist - in - duced current , which is also activated by [ Ca 2 1 ] i and suppressed by inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase pathway , has been described in aortic EC ( 137 ) . 2 . Amiloride - sensitive NSC An amiloride - sensitive , poorly selective cation chan - nel ( 23 pS for Na 1 and K 1 ) has been observed in brain microvessels ( 416 ) . This channel seems to be important for regulation of cation ﬂuxes across the blood - brain bar - rier . Constitutively open , nonselective Ca 2 1 - permeable cation channels have been detected in both luminal and abluminal membranes of endocardial EC . They consist mainly of two types of nonselective outwardly rectifying cation channels with a single - channel conductance of 36 and 11 pS , respectively . The permeability sequence for monovalent cations is K 1 . Rb 1 . Cs 1 . Na 1 . Li 1 which corresponds to the Eisenmann sequence IV and indicates a weak - ﬁeld strength binding site for these cat - ions ( 83 ) . Gd 3 1 and La 3 1 are efﬁcient blockers , whereas Ca 2 1 and Ba 2 1 but neither Mg 2 1 nor Mn 2 1 are permeable . Vasoactive agonists induce a nonselective cation current in endocardial EC with different ion selectivity and recti - ﬁcation properties ( 234 , 235 ) . 3 . Redox NSC Oxidant stress , which induces superoxide anions , activates a 28 - pS NSC in a calf pulmonary artery cell line . This channel is equally permeable for Na 1 and K 1 and also for Ca 2 1 . Oxidized glutathione , a cytosolic product of oxidant metabolism , activates these channels , whereas reduced glutathione reverses activation ( 198 ) . This chan - nel opens in two gating modes that do not depend on intracellular Ca 2 1 stores or on [ Ca 2 1 ] i . Activation of these channels and the concomitant membrane depolarization may limit Ca 2 1 inﬂux ( 199 ) . TRP3 has been proposed as a molecular candidate for this channel ( 10 ) . 4 . Cyclic nucleotide - gated channels NSC gated by cyclic nucleotides ( CNG ) have been recently identiﬁed in cultured rat EC . NH 2 and COOH termini of these channel proteins are cytoplasmic with the binding site for cyclic nucleotides located in the COOH terminus . These channels are directly gated by binding of cAMP or cGMP at the cyclic nucleotide - binding domain ( CNBD ) and also open at hyperpolarized potentials . The channels have a conductance of ; 20 pS for monovalent cations and are also Ca 2 1 permeable . A CNG1 member of the CNG family has been recently cloned in vascular endothelium . It is expressed in aorta , medium - sized mesenteric arteries , and small mesenteric arteries and forms a nonselective cation channel mediat - ing entry of extracellular Ca 2 1 that might be involved in the regulation of arterial blood pressure ( 452 ) . Agonist stimulation of rat pulmonary artery EC in primary culture activates CNG channels , which resemble CNG2 subunits of rat olfactory neurons . This activation is subsequent to Ca 2 1 entry , probably via store - operated or RACC channels , and is prevented in the presence of spe - ciﬁc inhibitors of soluble guanylate cyclase . It has been proposed that the increase of [ Ca 2 1 ] i upon agonist stim - ulation activates endothelial NO synthase ( eNOS ) , which in turn enhances NO levels , stimulates soluble guanylate cyclase , and increases cGMP levels , which then leads to activation of CNG2 ( see Fig . 2 and Ref . 441 ) . This endo - thelial CNG is neither selective for K 1 , Na 1 , Cs 1 , nor Rb 1 . Its activation contributes to membrane depolarization and exerts a negative feedback on Ca 2 1 entry . Modulation of CNG by cAMP via G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCR ) has so far not been described in EC . It has to be men - tioned that cGMP may also induce a negative feedback on SOC / RACC via a PKG pathway ( see sect . III B ) . In summary , EC lack typical ligand - gated channels , such as the P 2X receptor . They express several Ca 2 1 - permeable , receptor - operated NSC with diverse activa - tion mechanisms , superoxide - gated NSC , and cyclic nu - cleotide - gated channels . Background NSCs are probably constitutively open . Some RACCs might be members of the STRPC family . B . Store - Operated or Capacitative Ca 2 1 Entry ( SOC or CCE ) It is well known that compounds , such as tBHQ , cyclopiazonic acid ( CPA ) , and TG , which deplete intra - cellular Ca 2 1 stores without affecting Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 produc - tion , activate a Ca 2 1 inﬂux pathway in EC ( 73 , for a review see Refs . 295 , 358 , 359 , 398 , 399 ) . This inﬂux is apparently controlled by the ﬁlling degree of intracellular Ca 2 1 stores and is presumed to represent the major path - way for Ca 2 1 inﬂux during agonist stimulation ( 318 ) . Charged or ﬁlled stores prevent Ca 2 1 entry , whereas dis - charged or empty stores promote inﬂux of extracellular Ca 2 1 . We will use the term SOC for electrophysiological data and the term CCE for data derived from changes in intracellular Ca 2 1 upon readmission of extracellular Ca 2 1 to store - depleted cells . This distinction is not only seman - tic since the latter signals also depend on other mecha - nisms , such as Ca 2 1 sequestration and buffering which makes their interpretation often controversial . CCE sig - nals are not much affected by mitochondrial Ca 2 1 buffer - ing , but inhibition of the plasma membrane Ca 2 1 pump ( PMCA ) inhibits their secondary decay phase , indicating a modulating role of PMCA ( 194 ) . Other reports also indi - cate a modulating role of a Na 1 / Ca 2 1 exchanger on CCE ION CHANNELS IN VASCULAR ENDOTHELIUM 1419 Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m signals : inhibition of the exchanger increases CCE and delays the decay of store depletion - induced Ca 2 1 signals after reapplication of extracellular Ca 2 1 ( 75 , 118 , 315 ) . Changes in membrane potential in non - voltage - clamped cells will also affect the driving force for Ca 2 1 and hence the CCE signals . Store - operated Ca 2 1 channels ( SOC ) are obviously distinct from classical voltage - operated Ca 2 1 channels and Ca 2 1 - permeable RACCs . In general , SOCs are much more selective for Ca 2 1 than the above - described Ca 2 1 entry channels . Only two highly Ca 2 1 - selective agonist - activated channels have been described in EC . The one is activated by ATP and bradykinin and has been character - ized at both the whole cell and single - channel level in bovine aorta EC ( BAEC ) ( 227 ) . It is very selective for Ca 2 1 and Mn 2 1 and has a conductance of 2 . 5 pS for Mn 2 1 . Inositol 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 - tetrakisphosphate [ Ins ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 4 ] , but not Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 increases its open probability , which is ; 50 % lower at 1 m M [ Ca 2 1 ] i than at 1 mM [ Ca 2 1 ] i . The other highly Ca 2 1 - selective channel is gated by Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and has been observed in cell - attached , inside - out , and out - side - out patches in BAEC . Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 increases its open probability at a constant [ Ca 2 1 ] i , whereas Ins ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) P 4 is ineffective . This channel is reversibly blocked by heparin added to the intracellular side of inside - out patches and might be directly gated by Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 binding ( 400 ) . The best - described SOC is the so - called “Ca 2 1 - re - lease - activated Ca 2 1 - channel” ( CRAC ) , which has been studied extensively in mast cells and T lymphocytes ( 145 , 146 , 318 ) . CRAC is a highly Ca 2 1 - selective channel with a single - channel conductance of ; 30 fS for Ca 2 1 and of ; 40 pS for monovalent cations under divalent - free con - ditions ( 188 ) . The ﬁrst “CRAC - like” current in endothe - lium was published already in 1992 . Bradykinin activates a whole cell current in BAEC ( ; 10 pA / cell at a potential of 2 60 mV ) with characteristics similar to CRAC ( 251 ) , which is blocked by La 3 1 and inactivates rapidly if Ca 2 1 is the main charge carrier but not if it is carried by Na 1 . Inwardly rectifying CRAC - like currents have also been recorded in other endothelial cells after depleting intra - cellular Ca 2 1 stores by dialyzing them with either a high concentration of BAPTA to buffer [ Ca 2 1 ] i at very low concentrations or with Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , by extracellular ap - plication of ionomycin , or administration of the SERCA blockers TG or tBHQ . ( 88 , 109 , 110 , 306 ) . Store depletion protocols also activate Ca 2 1 channels in BAEC with a conductance between 5 and 11 pS and which are not highly selective for Ca 2 1 , i . e . , P Ca : P Na 5 10 ( 394 , 398 , 399 ) . The density of this current is approximately 2 0 . 5 pA / pF at 0 mV , which is ; 10 – 20 times smaller than that reported for Jurkat and peritoneal mast cells ( 318 ) . Its permeability sequence is Ca 2 1 . Na 1 . Cs 1 and Ca 2 1 . Ba 2 1 ( 88 ) . Elevation of extracellular Ca 2 1 increases the current am - plitude , whereas removal of extracellular divalent cations induces a large Na 1 current that is blocked by micromo - lar concentrations of La 3 1 . In general , it seems that SOC currents in EC exhibit much weaker inward rectiﬁcation , are less Ca 2 1 selective , and have a higher single - channel conductance than the typical CRAC currents . A typical example for activation of a SOC current in EA . hy926 cells , a cell line derived from human umbilical vein , is shown in Figure 3 . Breaking into the cell with a patch pipette containing a high concentra - tion of BAPTA , 30 m M Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , and 20 mM tBHQ activates within 30 – 60 s an inward current , which re - verses at a potential more positive than 50 mV and is FIG . 2 . Negative feedback of CNG - in - duced membrane depolarization on Ca 2 1 en - try . Ca 2 1 entry via RACC and / or SOC ele - vates [ Ca 2 1 ] i and stimulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) . The subse - quent activation of soluble guanylate cyclase ( sGC ) increases cGMP . cGMP and cAMP [ via agonist activation of G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , G s , and adenylate cy - clase ( AC ) ] activate CNG and / or HCN chan - nels , which induces membrane depolariza - tion . This depolarization exerts a negative feedback on Ca 2 1 entry via RACC / SOC . In addition , a feedback inhibition of Ca 2 1 entry channels via activation of PKG has been de - scribed ( 203 ) . 1420 BERND NILIUS AND GUY DROOGMANS Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m completely blocked by 1 m M La 3 1 . This protocol bypasses the agonist - mediated activation pathway via PLC activa - tion described for RACC , but the exact activation path - way of this channel remains to be elucidated . Pharmacological data on SOC currents in EC are rather scarce . They are almost completely blocked by 1 m M La 3 1 and inhibited by econazol , NPPB , Ni 2 1 , and carboxy - amidotriazole ( CAI ) , but a selective pharmacological blocker is not available . It has recently been shown that metabolites of the sphingomyelin pathway inhibit CRAC in RBL cells ( 244 ) . However , sphingosylphosphorylcholine , which increases membrane capacitance in RBL cells , acti - vates SOCs and NO production in EC ( 257 ) . Likely , mem - brane lipids and metabolites of membrane breakdown are directly involved in regulation of CCE ( see also sect . III C ) . The thiazolidinedione troglitazone and the imidazole - deriv - ative SKF 96365 both block CCE in EC ( 186 , 210 , 366 ) . It has been shown recently that binding of capsaicin to vanilloid receptor ( VR ) receptors , which are members of the OTRPC subfamily , inhibits CCE ( 57 ) . FIG . 3 .

Stimulation of EC with vasoactive com - pounds , and application of TG results in tyrosine phos - phorylation of 42 - and 44 - kDa isoforms of mitogen - acti - vated protein kinase ( MAP kinase ) . Inhibition of this phosphorylation attenuates CCE . Tyrosine kinases may therefore be associated with the regulation of CCE ( 94 ) . Calmodulin seems to inhibit CCE ( 394 ) , whereas activa - tion of protein kinase C ( PKC ) inhibits CRAC ( 318 ) . Ac - tivation of protein kinase G ( PKG ) has been shown ( 204 ) to inhibit both SOC ( patch - clamp data ) and CCE ( Ca 2 1 entry ) . The signal transduction mechanism linking changes in intraluminal Ca 2 1 to the opening of plasma membrane Ca 2 1 channels is still controversial . Various second mes - sengers have been suggested , such as a low - molecular - weight “Ca 2 1 inﬂux factor” ( CIF , 500 Da ) , an unidentiﬁed tyrosine kinase or phosphatase , the arachidonic acid me - tabolite 5 , 6 - epoxyeicosatrienoic acid ( 5 , 6 - EET ) , cGMP , 1 , 2 - diacylglycerol ( DAG ) or metabolized arachidonic acid derivatives to explain the cross talk between Ca 2 1 stores and membrane channels . Activation of cytochrome P - 450 epoxygenase 2C , the endothelial isoform of the endoplas - mic reticulum cytochrome P - 450 monooxygenase ( Cyt P - 450 MO ) , by b - naphthoﬂavone induces the biosynthesis of 5 , 6 - EET and potentiates CCE in BAEC , porcine aorta and human umbilical vein ( 119 ) , whereas several P - 450 inhib - itors diminish CCE and induction of Cyt P - 450 MO . In addition , depletion of endothelial Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - sensitive stores directly activates Cyt P - 450 MO ( 139 ) . It has there - fore been proposed that Cyt P - 450 MO - derived 5 , 6 - EETs may constitute a signal for CCE activation . It has also been suggested that Ins ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 4 or Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 or a decrease of [ Ca 2 1 ] i in a restricted sub - plasmalemmal space may directly gate the entry channels and that a direct coupling between CRAC and the Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 receptor may control channel gating ( 8 , 14 , 58 , 141 , 144 , 193 , 318 , 342 ) . A direct physical contact between Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 receptors in the endoplasmic retic - ulum and COOH - terminal contact sites of the putative plasma membrane TRP channels may be functionally in - volved ( 192 , 193 ) . Two short stretches of 54 ( position 742 – 795 ) and 21 amino acids ( position 777 – 797 ) that bind strongly to speciﬁc sequences in the Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 receptor have been identiﬁed in hTRP3 . The binding domain in the InsP 3 receptor comprises 289 amino acids downstream of the Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 binding site ( position 638 – 926 ) ( 37 ) . This protein - protein complex may fulﬁll a similar function as the dTRP , PKC , receptor complex with the PDZ - domain protein InaD in Drosophila ( 258 , 339 ) . More recently , it has been shown that stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) receptor - 2 by VEGF - E , which in - duces store depletion probably via phosphorylation of PLC - g , activates CRAC - like currents , which are blocked by micromolar concentrations of La 3 1 and are enhanced in amplitude if carried by Na 1 in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 1 ( single - channel conductance of ; 45 pS ; Lepple - Wien - hues , personal communication ) , a value similar to that ob - served in T lymphocytes ( 36 – 40 pS , Ref . 188 ) . C . TRPCs : Diverse Ca 2 1 Entry Channels in EC ? The tremendous efforts in the last 3 years to identify mammalian genes encoding for Ca 2 1 entry channels have resulted in the discovery of the trp gene family ( “transient receptor potential” ) in photoreceptors of Drosophila . The genes of this still expanding family might be related to several types of Ca 2 1 - entry channels but in a much broader sense than encoding for store - operated Ca 2 1 en - try channels only ( 22 , 29 , 144 , 457 – 459 ) . Trp genes encode a superfamily of proteins with six transmembrane helices , which can be divided into three subfamilies , i . e . , S ( hort ) - TRPCs , L ( ong ) TRPCs , and O ( sm - 9 - like ) TRPCs ( Fig . 4 , Ref . 132 ) . The latter group , named after its homology to the osm - 9 members in Caenorhabditis elegans which re - spond to changes in osmolarity , contains interesting members , such as the epithelial Ca 2 1 channel ( ECaC ) involved in Ca 2 1 reabsorption in the distal tubules of the kidney , NSC such as the vanilloid receptor VR1 , VRL1 , and the insulin - like growth factor regulated channel GRC ( 132 , 140 , 183 , 408 ) . The LTRPC group contains proteins of more than 1 , 600 amino acids , the function of which is presently not understood . The STRPC group of proteins between 700 and 1 , 000 amino acids comprises the mammalian isoforms of TRP1 – 7 , which are composed of six transmembrane he - lices with a pore - forming loop between the ﬁfth and sixth helix ( Fig . 4 ) . The NH 2 terminus of all isoforms contains three highly conserved ankyrin domains . The NH 2 - termi - nal part of the COOH terminus bears a proline - rich motif ( 29 , 132 , 329 , 333 , 457 ) . The TM4 region lacks the positive charges typical for voltage - gated ion channels ( 16 , 29 , 457 ) . STRPCs contain several calmodulin - binding regions , which may mediate the Ca 2 1 - dependent modulation of store - related Ca 2 1 entry . However , the functional effect of calmodulin is difﬁcult to evaluate because it inﬂuences many EC functions including the uptake of Ca 2 1 into intracellular stores ( 437 ) . Some STRPCs ( e . g . , TRP1 ) have NH 2 - terminal coiled - coil structures and COOH - terminal dystrophin motifs ( for details see Ref . 333 ) . STRPCs are mainly activated by agonist stimulation of diverse recep - tors coupled to different PLC isoforms but some probably by store depletion . It is not clear how these channel proteins are orga - nized , but the extreme functional heterogeneity observed in expression experiments may point to a multihetero - meric structure . Proper heteromerization may depend on unidentiﬁed auxiliary proteins similar to the Drosophila InaD ( from the mutant “inactivation no afterpotential” ) 1422 BERND NILIUS AND GUY DROOGMANS Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m protein . This protein contains ﬁve PDZ domains ( compris - ing DTSL motifs ) and is physically linked to the rhodopsin PLC ( NorpA ) , a PKC ( InaC ) , and the G q a - protein photo - activated by rhodopsin . The entire structure forms a sig - naling complex in which dTRP and dTRPL are integrated ( 258 ) . PDZ domains probably mediate the clustering of membrane and membrane - associated proteins with TRP channels . A similar protein hINAl ( human InaD like ) , which is twice as long as the Drosophila InaD ( 1 , 525 vs . 675 amino acids ) , has been cloned in human ( 330 ) and has been detected in human EC ( V . Flockerzi and B . Nilius , unpublished data ) . In this context , formation of structural complexes of Ca 2 1 entry channels could also be integrin dependent , since an integrin - associated protein ( IAP - 50 ) physically bound to integrin b 3 has been proposed to function as a Ca 2 1 entry channel ( 363 ) . This signaling pathway seems to be linked to the generation of inositol phosphate and the production of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( 328 ) . INAF is another 241 - amino acid protein that is probably in - volved in Ca 2 1 signaling via STRPC proteins , since muta - tions in the gene encoding for this protein directly affect TRP channel function ( 215 ) . The activation steps following PLC stimulation are unclear for all STRPC isoforms . One group of STRPCs ( still frequently described as TRPs ) seems to be activated via production of DAG and by binding of polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ; Refs . 58 , 132 , 141 , 142 ) . Stimulation of EC via activation of the pertussis toxin - insensitive G q protein - coupled PLC - b causes Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 production that initiates store depletion and probably STRPC - medi - ated Ca 2 1 entry . Also PLC - g , which is activated by ago - nist - stimulated receptor tyrosine kinases and growth fac - tor receptor tyrosine kinases , may activate STRPCs ( 98 ) . Figure 5 summarizes the activation pathways for STRPCs that may be relevant for EC . It has to be noted that only a few members of the putative STRPC family have been analyzed at the functional level . Phylogenetic analysis of the mammalian STRPCs ( TRPs ) reveals four subfamilies ( see Fig . 6 A ; Refs . 98 , 132 , 142 , 333 ) . FIG . 4 . The superfamily of TRP channels . Putative domain structure of the TRP proteins consisting of 6 transmembrane helices . The NH 2 terminus contains several ankyrin repeats that may be important for interaction with the cytoskeleton ; the COOH terminus contains a proline - rich motif . The putative pore region is between helix 5 and 6 . This basic structure is com - mon to all members of the TRP channel superfamily ( 131 ) . This family can be divided on the basis of homology into three subfamilies : short ( STRPC ) , osm ( OTRPC ) , and long ( LTRPC ) . These subfamilies have structural differences , as indicated . For further expla - nation , see text and References 131 , 141 .

Heterogeneously expressed mTRP4 and mTRP5 are NSCs with a single - channel conductance of 42 – 66 pS that can be stimulated by guanosine 5 9 - O - ( 3 - thiotriphosphate ) ( GTP g S ) . The activation pathway may integrate signaling pathways from G protein - coupled re - ceptors and receptor tyrosine kinases independently of store depletion . Their biophysical properties are inconsis - tent with those of CRAC channels . In other experiments , however , TRP4 and - 5 are clearly store dependent and have a much higher Ca 2 1 selectivity ( 331 , 332 , 434 ) . 2 ) TRP1 , which is closely related to TRP4 and - 5 in terms of evolutionary distance , probably forms SOCs ( 223 , 224 , 431 ) but is probably less Ca 2 1 selective than TRP4 and - 5 ( 329 , 387 , 434 ) . 3 ) The short TRP3 , TRP6 , and TRP7 with ; 800 amino acids form store - independent NSCs probably activated via the DAG pathway ( 141 ) and are also sensitive to [ Ca 2 1 ] i ( 178 , 307 , 461 ) . TRP3 and - 6 have a conductance between 25 and 66 pS and are not very Ca 2 1 selective ( 141 , 178 ) . However , also a store - dependent activation mechanism has been considered for hTRP3 ( 124 , 193 ) . FIG . 5 . Activation mechanisms of the short TRP channels . Short TRP channels are mainly activated via agonist receptors ( G pro - tein - coupled receptor , GPCR , and receptor tyrosine kinases , RTK ) ( 131 ) . These recep - tors activate various phospholipase C . Some STRPCs are directly activated by 1 , 2 - diacyl - glycerol ( DAG ) or via still unknown interac - tions with G proteins , Ca 2 1 , or even InsP 3 . TRP3 , - 6 , and - 7 are probably receptor - acti - vated cation channels or RACCs . Another mechanism of activation is probably related to emptying of intracellular Ca 2 1 stores ( see Fig . 3 A ) .

Several TRPs are expressed in endothelium , as illus - trated by their expression pattern in mouse aorta in Fig - ure 6 B . Their expression varies , however , considerably between different types of EC , as shown in Table 2 . BPAEC express TRP1 and - 4 ; BAEC two splice variants of TRP1 , - 3 , - 4 , and - 5 ; HUVEC cells TRP1 , - 3 , and - 4 ; mouse aorta EC TRP1 , - 2 , - 3 , - 4 , and - 6 ; and rat pulmonary EC TRP1 but neither TRP3 nor - 6 ( 52 , 124 , 178 , 259 ) . SOC currents have been identiﬁed in BPAEC cells ( 88 ) , but agonist stimulation does not activate Ca 2 1 - per - meable NSCs in these TRP3 - deﬁcient cells . Expression of hTRP3 gives rise to functional expression of 25 - pS NSCs and enhances the agonist - induced Ca 2 1 increase in these cells ( Fig . 7 , Ref . 178 ) , suggesting that hTRP3 channels TABLE 2 .

These channels share several properties with an endogenous nonselective Ca 2 1 entry channel observed in TRP3 - expressing EA . hy926 cells ( 177 ) . Expression of an NH 2 - terminal fragment of hTRP3 , which exerts a domi - nant negative effect on TRP channel function presumably due to suppression of channel assembly ( 124 ) , abolishes activation of a store - dependent , agonist - activated nonse - lective cation current in HUVEC cells ( 124 ) . These results suggest a role of STRPC - related proteins as store - oper - ated and / or agonist - activated cation channels identical to TRP3 . Other studies show that b - estradiol signiﬁcantly downregulates TRP4 , and transretinoic acid dramatically upregulates TRP5 , whereas these hormones have little effect on CCE ( 52 ) . Expression of TRP1 and TRP4 in BPAEC induces a cation current that is activated by tBHQ and Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , suggesting that both STRPCs may form functional but not highly Ca 2 1 - selective channels ( 409 ) . Interestingly , activation of TRP1 in rat pulmonary EC induces changes in EC shape and remodeling of the pe - ripheral ( cortical ) ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) cytoskele - ton ( 259 ) . Another question refers to the nature of Ca 2 1 stores involved in CCE activation . In addition to Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - mediated Ca 2 1 release , ryanodine - sensitive Ca 2 1 release ( RsCR ) seems also to be important for Ca 2 1 signaling in EC . Several studies have presented evidence for endothe - lial ryanodine receptors ( 1 , 62 , 213 , 460 ) . In human aortic EC , ryanodine - sensitive Ca 2 1 stores seem to be involved in the regulation of agonist - sensitive , Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - de - pleted Ca 2 1 pools . Caffeine and ryanodine induce only a small Ca 2 1 entry if the Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - sensitive stores are ﬁlled . However , after store depletion , caffeine but not ryanodine induces Ca 2 1 entry ( 62 ) . One likely interpreta - tion of these effects is that caffeine regulates CCE and / or that caffeine also controls the extent of store depletion by agonist stimulation . Also other experiments show that RsCR may modulate but not initiate CCE . By using de - convolution microscopy to monitor simultaneously cyto - solic , perinuclear Ca 2 1 by fura 2 and membrane near , subplasmalemmal Ca 2 1 by the cell membrane imperme - able dye FFP - 18 in the same EC ( 315 ) , it has been shown that Ca 2 1 release initiated by ryanodine increases sub - plasmalemmal Ca 2 1 but not perinuclear Ca 2 1 . In addition , conditions that initiate RsCR also increase CCE . Although these data support the existence of local Ca 2 1 gradients , they are not indicative for CCE activation by the dis - charge of ryanodine - sensitive Ca 2 1 stores . Other ﬁndings do not support any effect of the discharge of ryanodine - sensitive stores on Ca 2 1 entry or Mn 2 1 quenching ( 354 ) . However , subplasmalemmal Ca 2 1 elevation could dramat - ically change the driving force for Ca 2 1 entry by activating BK Ca channels , which in turn would affect CCE ( see sect . IV A2 ) . D . Ca 2 1 Entry Via a Na 1 / Ca 2 1 Exchanger , NCX ? The modulation of endothelial Ca 2 1 signaling via a Na 1 / Ca 2 1 exchanger ( NCX ) is an incompletely resolved issue . Several groups have shown that a reduction of the Na 1 gradient increases [ Ca 2 1 ] i via an NCX - mediated Ca 2 1 entry ( 352 , 369 , 378 , 385 ) . Evidence that the exchanger may also shape Ca 2 1 transients activated by vasoactive agonists comes from experiments in which [ Ca 2 1 ] i tran - sients are modulated by changing Na 1 gradients , loading EC with Na 1 by using the ionophore monensin , applica - tion of NCX blockers , such as 3 9 , 4 9 - dichlorobenzamil ( in comparison with the NCX ineffective amiloride ) or La 3 1 ( 369 ) . Recently , a NCX protein was detected in caveolin - rich EC membrane fractions ( 385 ) . FIG . 7 .

Conclusion Ca 2 1 entry in EC occurs via different pathways , but the molecular nature of these different entry pathways and their mechanism of activation are still elusive . Likely , endothelial Ca 2 1 entry channels belong to the family of STRPC which comprise both receptor - activated , NSC and more Ca 2 1 - selective store - operated channels . Activation of these channels occurs via both GPCR and receptor tyrosine kinases . In addition , ligand - gated Ca 2 1 - perme - able channels , such as CNG channels and P 2X receptors , and probably endothelial isoforms of the NCX provide alternative pathways for Ca 2 1 entry in EC . These mecha - nisms , which are controlled by various signaling cas - cades , are important for maintaining long - lasting re - sponses of EC “on demand , ” such as Ca 2 1 - dependent synthesis and release of NO , secretion of vasoactive com - pounds out of vesicular compartments , and probably also during stimulation of EC by growth factors , such as VEGF . IV . ION CHANNELS CONTROLLING MEMBRANE POTENTIAL A crucial role of ion channels in endothelial Ca 2 1 signaling is the ﬁne - tuning of the electrochemical gradient for Ca 2 1 ( 176 , 226 , 271 , 272 ) . The inﬂuence of membrane potential , which as discussed in section VIII A is deter - mined by the expression pattern of various ion channels , on Ca 2 1 entry in EC has been clearly demonstrated ( 170 , 176 , 226 , 359 ) . K 1 channels , including Ca 2 1 - activated K 1 channels , inwardly rectifying K 1 channels , and probably also voltage - dependent K 1 channels , are the major class of ion channels in setting the membrane potential . In addition , it has been shown recently that Ca 2 1 entry in freshly isolated EC from rabbit aorta requires the pres - ence of extracellular Cl 2 to maintain a polarized mem - brane ( 433 ) . Thus Cl 2 channels , e . g . , volume - regulated anion channels ( VRAC ) , Ca 2 1 - activated Cl 2 channels ( CaCC ) and , interestingly , also cystic ﬁbrosis transmem - brane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) channels , recently detected in EC ( 388 ) , might be important modulators of the inwardly driving force for Ca 2 1 . In addition , NSC may tune the membrane potential of resting and activated EC ( 178 , 419 ) . A . NSC Some NSC are obviously impermeable for Ca 2 1 ( 419 ) . They may induce a negative feedback on Ca 2 1 entry by inducing depolarization of EC ( see also Fig . 2 ) . Little information is available at the molecular level . Probably , some TRP members might be candidates for background Ca 2 1 - impermeable NSC in resting endothelium . Recently , a family of NSC has been cloned which includes channels activated by hyperpolarization and by cyclic nucleotides ( HCN ; Refs . 24 , 25 – 27 , 228 ) . Four new members of this family with a length between 780 and . 900 amino acids have been cloned recently . These chan - nels consist of six transmembrane domains ( TM ) and are modulated by binding of cyclic nucleotides to a CNBD . TM4 is positively charged and contains at least 10 arginine and lysine residues . These channels show a high overall similarity with the cone CNG . They activate slowly at hyperpolarized potentials and binding of cyclic nucleo - tides . They are permeable for monovalent but not for divalent cations , Na 1 being more permeable than K 1 ( P Na : P K ; 0 . 15 – 0 . 3 ) . HCN channels play a role as media - tors of NO - and cGMP - dependent cellular processes ( 25 ) . Therefore , they might be of potential importance in EC . Indeed , in EC from the blood - brain barrier , a hyperpolar - ization - activated current carried by Na 1 and K 1 has been described ( 165 ) that is modulated by NO , cGMP , and cAMP . Its modulation by a cyclic guanosine nucleotide may also explain previous results about a role for NO in regulating blood - brain barrier function . B . K 1 Channels 1 . Inwardly rectifying K 1 channels ( IRK or K ir ) IRK is one of the most important channels for the control of the resting potential in nonstimulated cells . It conducts inward currents at potentials more negative than the K 1 equilibrium potential but permits much smaller currents at potentials positive to that potential . However , this channel is quite heterogeneously expressed in different EC types . Some macrovascular EC express the inward rectiﬁer channel ( BPAEC , BAEC , coronary EC ) , others do not ( microvascular EC , EA . hy926 cells ) , whereas in other cells only a fraction of the cells shows IRK activity ( HUVEC , Ref . 290 ) . In general , the channel appears to be more abundant in cultured than in primary EC . In intact endocardial endothelium , it is mainly con - ﬁned to the luminal side of the cells ( 235 ) , but it appears to be randomly distributed in monolayers of cultured BAEC ( 60 ) . If present , this conductance together with the basal activity of the volume - regulated anion channel and a background NSC determine the resting membrane po - tential of EC ( 46 , 96 , 419 ) . As discussed in section VIII A , the impact of these channels on the resting potential is often counteracted by that of Cl 2 and background NSC channels . In addition to its well - understood role in controlling electrogenesis , IRK is a K 1 sensor , as shown in Figure 8 . A small increase in extracellular K 1 , e . g . , resulting from the activation of BK Ca channels , shifts the reversal poten - tial for K 1 toward a more positive value and thereby increases the conductance of IRK . This enhanced IRK ION CHANNELS IN VASCULAR ENDOTHELIUM 1427 Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m conductance is sufﬁcient to overcome the depolarizing action of the nonselective cation and Cl 2 conductance ( see also Fig . 11 ) and shifts the membrane potential to - ward more negative potentials . The conductance of single endothelial K ir channels ranges from 23 to 30 pS in symmetrical K 1 solutions ( 84 , 156 , 180 , 290 , 295 , 325 , 372 , 373 ) . Typical features of this channel are the increase in single - channel conductance with the square root of the extracellular K 1 concentration ( 289 , 373 , 462 ) and a permeation proﬁle of P K . P Rb . P Cs ( 325 , 373 ) . Extracellular Ba 2 1 , TEA , TBA , and Cs 1 all block K ir ( 214 , 322 , 343 , 419 , 427 ) . Extracellular Mg 2 1 causes a time - dependent block at negative potentials , which can be antagonized by extracellular K 1 . At positive potentials , also intracellular Mg 2 1 induces a time - and voltage - depen - dent block ( 84 ) . The shear stress evoked hyperpolarization of EC has been attributed to an enhanced outward whole cell K 1 current , which can be blocked by Cs 1 . Shear stress also enhances the open probability of IRK channels in luminal cell - attached patches ( 312 ) and in inside - out patches ( 163 ) . IRK seems to be metabolically regulated . Intracellu - lar ATP but not its nonhydrolyzable analogs adenosine 5 9 - O - ( 3 - thiotriphosphate ) ( ATP g S ) and adenylyl imido - diphosphate ( AMP - PNP ) prevent its rundown in whole cell mode . Reduction of intracellular ATP and induction of hypoxic conditions dramatically downregulate IRK ( 180 ) . The phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid also pre - vents rundown , but protamine , an activator of phospha - tase 2A ( PP2A ) , enhances the rate of rundown . Phosphor - ylation of the channel molecule therefore seems to be essential for maintaining its activity , its rundown proba - bly being due to dephosphorylation by PP2A ( 180 ) . An interesting observation is the inhibition of IRK in capillary and macrovascular endothelial cells by the va - soactive agonists angiotensin II , vasopressin , vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP ) , endothelin ( ET ) - 1 , and hista - mine ( 150 , 290 , 322 , 456 ) . A similar inhibition has been observed if GTP g S is applied via the patch pipette ( 150 , 180 ) . This inhibition is probably due to activation of a pertussis toxin ( PTX ) - insensitive G protein , which may mediate these inhibitory actions by modulating PPA2 . IRK has been identiﬁed as Kir2 . 1 , a member of the Kir family ( 95 , 179 ) . Two highly conserved transmembrane regions , consisting of 427 amino acids and a highly con - served TIGYG - H5 motif in the pore region , characterize this channel . pH insensitivity , which is also characteristic for the endothelial IRK , is conferred on the channel by a methionine at site 84 ( M84 ) . Mg 2 1 and spermine , spermi - dine , and putrescine block appears to be linked to D172 . S425 in the COOH - terminal phosphorylation motif RRE - SEI , which is important for modulation of Kir2 . 1 , might be a candidate for the observed modulation by phosphatases ( 180 ) . In addition to well - deﬁned IRK channels , a number of poorly characterized K 1 channels , apparently not belong - ing to any of the cloned subfamilies of K 1 channels , have been observed in EC . An example is the 170 - pS inward FIG . 8 . IRK ( Kir2 . 1 ) channels are K 1 sensors . A : topological scheme of the EC Kir 2 . 1 channel , showing the GYG motif in the pore and the RRESEI phosphory - lation site in the COOH terminus that is important for channel modulation . B : typical I - V curves in BPAEC ( see also Figs . 7 and 11 ) . The net current I - V relationships are composed of several ionic current as discussed above . Note the ﬂat I - V relationship at low extracellular K 1 concentrations , which are consistent with an unstable membrane potential . C : increasing extracellular K 1 to 12 mM , although shifting the reversal potential of IRK ( Kir2 . 1 ) toward more positive values , stabilizes the mem - brane potential at more negative values because of the increase in conductance of IRK . After washing out of the elevated K 1 , the bistable behavior of the membrane potential is reﬂected in the transient ﬂuctuations be - tween two polarization levels . D : effect of changing ex - tracellular K 1 from 6 to 12 mM in nine individual EC is also shown . Note the homogeneous response indicating a K 1 sensor function of IRK . ( From B . Nilius and J .

Ca 2 1 - activated K 1 channels The initial response to most EC stimuli is an increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i that is often due to inﬂux of Ca 2 1 and therefore depends on the electrochemical Ca 2 1 gradient , primarily set by the membrane potential . The depolarizing action of Ca 2 1 inﬂux on the membrane potential is in various EC compensated by activation of Ca 2 1 - dependent K 1 - chan - nels ( K Ca ) , their increased open probability at elevated [ Ca 2 1 ] i causing membrane hyperpolarization . Different types of Ca 2 1 - activated K 1 channels have been described , e . g . , BK Ca or maxi - K channels , IK Ca or intermediate - con - ductance channels , and SK Ca or small - conductance chan - nels . However , the expression of these channels between different types of EC is also very heterogeneous ( 295 ) . High - conductance Ca 2 1 - activated K 1 channels , BK Ca , are expressed in most freshly isolated EC and EC in primary culture . Their conductance ranges between 165 and 240 pS ( 129 , 147 , 176 , 179 , 220 , 289 , 349 , 381 ) . The fast elevation in [ Ca 2 1 ] i during stimulation with vasoactive agonists induces a fast increase in the probability of the channel being open . The open probability is enhanced at more positive potentials , suggesting that the apparent Ca 2 1 afﬁnity of the channel is voltage dependent and that the open probability depends on both [ Ca 2 1 ] i and voltage . An increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i shifts the voltage dependence of activation toward more negative potentials ( 13 , 63 , 129 , 176 , 317 ) . The endothelial BK Ca is blocked by charybdotoxin ( IC 50 ; 50 nM ) , iberiotoxin , TEA ( IC 50 ; 1 mM , 100 % block at 10 mM ) , D - tubocurarine , and quinine . Extracellular Mg 2 1 block is voltage dependent ( 13 , 349 , 350 ) . The ben - zimidazolone compounds NS004 and NS1619 ( in the m M range ) increase the open probability of BK Ca in EC and shift its activation curve toward more negative potentials ( 121 , 316 ) . Nanomolar amounts of intracellular dehy - drosoyasaponin ( DHS - I ) induce discrete episodes of high channel open probability interrupted by periods of appar - ently normal activity . DHS - I decreases the Ca 2 1 concen - tration for half - maximal activation of the channel ( 113 , 247 ) . BK Ca activators may be functionally important , since it has been shown in many assays that inhibition of BK Ca interferes with NO release ( 42 ) . It has not yet been shown that cGMP - dependent kinases can activate BK Ca in EC like in smooth muscle ( 166 , 445 ) . Ca 2 1 - activated K 1 channels in vascular smooth mus - cle cells are targets for various physiological factors re - leased from the endothelium , including NO ( 31 , 346 , 384 ) and endothelium - derived hyperpolarizing factor ( EDHF ; probably a cytochrome P - 450 - derived arachidonic acid metabolite ; Refs . 92 , 334 ) . This latter compound also ex - erts an autocrine effect on BK Ca in inside - out patches of primary cultures of endothelial cells from pig coronary artery ( 12 ) . A similar autocrine effect of NO release is however unlikely , since the NO donor S - nitrosocysteine does neither directly activate nor modulate BK Ca channels activated by increased [ Ca 2 1 ] i in cultured endothelial cells ( 129 ) . Interestingly , K 1 efﬂux via endothelial BK Ca might activate K 1 - sensitive smooth muscle IRK channels and induce hyperpolarization . Thus K 1 itself may act as EDHF ( 82 ) . BK Ca has been identiﬁed by RT - PCR analysis as hslo in EA . hy926 cells ( 179 ) . Mammalian slo channels , consist - ing of ; 1 , 200 amino acids , share a high degree of homol - ogy with voltage - dependent K 1 channels and consist of six transmembrane segments with a positively charged S4 segment . Five additional hydrophobic segments form a unique secondary structure in the COOH terminus of the mammalian slo channel . The origin of the voltage depen - dence is not completely clear , but hslo channels probably contain a Ca 2 1 - independent intrinsic voltage sensor ( 411 ) . An extra segment ( segment 0 ) in the NH 2 terminal is probably a coupling site for the b - subunit . Four b - sub - units have been cloned so far : b 1 seems to be mainly expressed in smooth muscle cells ; b 2 in endocrine cells ; b 3 probably in epithelium , liver , pancreas , and intestinal tract ; and b 4 in the central nervous system ( 15 ) . The unique COOH terminus possibly contains four additional helices , H7 – H10 , which represent almost 70 % of the pro - tein ( 80 , 392 ) . A 28 - amino acid stretch between segment 9 and 10 contains highly conserved negatively charged amino acid residues that possibly form a highly selective Ca 2 1 binding site , the “Ca 2 1 bowl” ( Fig . 9 A , and Ref . 362 ) . Expression of a - hslo in EC that lack BK Ca channels en - hances the agonist - induced increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i and shifts the membrane potential toward more negative values , a functional example in support of the role of the driving force for Ca 2 1 inﬂux in EC . Figure 9 , B and C , shows an example of such an expression experiment in BPAEC , which does not express functional slo channels . The pla - teau phase of the Ca 2 1 transient in BPAEC cells trans - fected with hslo is much more pronounced than in non - transfected cells . This ﬁnding correlates with the hyperpolarizing action of vasoactive agonists in the trans - fected cells and indicates that activation of hslo - BK Ca exerts a positive feedback on the Ca 2 1 signals by coun - teracting the negative ( depolarizing ) effect of Ca 2 1 - acti - vated Cl 2 channels ( 179 ) . The b - subunit of hslo could not be detected with RT - PCR methods in EC , which does not exclude the presence of other b - subunits . The BK Ca opener DHS - I , which only works in the presence of the b - subunit , is ineffective in EC ( 248 , 383 ) , a functional indication for the absence of the b 1 - subunit . Expression of the b - subunit in EA . hy926 cells induces a leftward shift of the activation curve and has a sensitizing effect on BK Ca ( 316 , 317 ) . ION CHANNELS IN VASCULAR ENDOTHELIUM 1429 Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Ryanodine - sensitive Ca 2 1 release during agonist stimulation is the main activator of BK Ca in an umbilical vein - derived cell line , suggesting that these channels may form a subplasmalemmal complex with Ca 2 1 release units located in their close vicinity ( 100 ) . Intermediate - conductance , Ca 2 1 - activated K 1 - chan - nels , IK Ca , are inwardly rectifying and have a conductance between 30 and 80 pS in symmetrical K 1 and 15 pS at physiological extracellular K 1 . IK Ca are activated by Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - sensitive Ca 2 1 release induced by agonists , such as bradykinin , acetylcholine , and ATP ( 355 ) . ET - 1 and ET - 3 activate IK Ca channels in brain microvascular endothelium via endothelin - A receptors ( 404 ) . A Ca 2 1 - dependent 30 - pS channel in cultured BAEC is regulated by G proteins ( 401 ) . GTP together with Mg 2 1 , as well as GTP g S stimulates IK Ca , an effect that is reversed by guanosine 5 9 - O - ( 2 - thiodiphosphate ) ( GDP b S ) . An agonist - activated IK Ca with a single - channel conductance of 34 pS and a dissociation constant ( K D ) of 0 . 63 m M for Ca 2 1 has been described in intact endocardial cells ( 234 ) . The pharmacology of the endothelial IK Ca is not very detailed . Charybdotoxin , quinine , and TBA are efﬁcient blockers of IK Ca channels ( 220 , 355 , 356 , 404 ) . Noxius - toxin , a toxin puriﬁed from Centuroides scorpion toxin ( 61 , 396 ) , and interestingly NS1619 ( 44 ) , an activator of BK Ca channels , are potent inhibitors of IK Ca channels . The hydrophilic oxidative reagents 5 , 5 9 - dithio - bis ( 2 - nitroben - zoic acid ) and thimerosal reduce IK Ca channel activity in BAEC recorded in inside - out experiments but do not af - fect its unitary conductance . This activity is partly re - stored by the SH - group reducing agents dithiothreitol or reduced glutathione . The lipid - soluble oxidative agent 4 , 4 9 - dithiodipyridine is less potent , suggesting that critical SH groups localized at the inner face of the cell membrane may be involved in channel gating ( 45 ) .

Currents are inwardly rec - tifying , K D for Ca 2 1 activation is 0 . 3 m M , and their single - channel conductance is 39 pS . The channels are reversibly blocked by charybdotoxin ( inhibitory constant 5 2 . 5 nM ) and clotrimazole , minimally affected by apamin , iberio - toxin , or ketoconazole ( 158 ) . Importantly , this channel lacks putative Ca 2 1 - binding sites , but the proximal COOH terminus contains a Ca 2 1 - dependent calmodulin ( CaM ) - binding site that is probably associated with four CaM molecules ( 87 , 190 ) . Small - conductance Ca 2 1 - activated K 1 channels , SK Ca , with a conductance of ; 10 pS in asymmetrical conditions have also been observed in EC ( 122 , 265 , 353 ) . Unlike BK Ca , these channels are not voltage sensitive . They are blocked by TBA , apamin , clotrimazole , and D - tubocurarine ( 122 ) . Recently , two types of SK Ca chan - nels were identiﬁed in excised patches of rat aortic EC with a conductance of 18 and 9 pS in symmetrical 150 mM K 1 , and 6 . 7 pS and 2 . 8 pS at physiological extracellular K 1 concentrations ( 241 ) . The smaller one is completely blocked by 10 nM apamin and 100 m M D - tubocurarine , and the larger one is insensitive to apamin but inhibited by charybdotoxin at concentrations . 50 nM . The topology of SK Ca is similar to that of voltage - gated K 1 channels , ex - hibiting six TM helices and an intracellular COOH and NH 2 terminus . Primary sequences , however , are very dif - ferent . Likely , four subunits form the channel . No EF hand , C2A , or Ca 2 1 bowl motif indicative for Ca 2 1 binding has been found . Gating of SK Ca involves a Ca 2 1 - indepen - dent interaction of calmodulin with the COOH - terminal domain of the a - subunit and is mediated by binding of Ca 2 1 to the ﬁrst and second EF hand motifs in the NH 2 - terminal domain of CaM ( 187 , 442 ) . 3 . ATP - sensitive K 1 channels , K ATP The reduced intracellular ATP content during isch - emic / hypoxic conditions can be mimicked by intracellular dialysis with ATP - free solutions or application of extra - cellular glucose - free / NaCN solutions . Under these condi - tions , increased whole cell and single - channel currents have been observed in EC from rat aorta and brain mi - crovessels . Currents are reversibly blocked by gliben - clamide or ATP in inside - out patches and activated by the K ATP channel opener pinacidil ( 164 ) . Lowering intracellu - lar ATP or applying the K 1 channel activator levcro - makalim evokes unitary currents with a conductance of 25 pS in rabbit aortic EC . They are inhibited by gliben - clamide or in inside - out patches by increasing the ATP concentration ( 184 , 185 ) . Low concentrations of the K 1 channel openers diazoxide and rilmakalim cause a pro - nounced glibenclamide - sensitive hyperpolarization in cor - onary capillary EC and induce a rapid Ca 2 1 transient followed by a sustained elevation of [ Ca 2 1 ] i . The high sensitivity to diazoxide has been interpreted as a novel type of K ATP channel composed of a novel combination of K ir and sulfonylurea receptor ( SUR ) subunits ( 208 ) . At present , Kir6 . 1 and Kir6 . 2 were detected in freshly iso - lated capillaries from guinea pig heart . It is not known whether Kir6 . 1 and / or Kir6 . 2 a - subunits form the K ATP channels together with the b - subunit SUR2B in EC ( 249 ) . Langheinrich et al . ( 207 ) have also reported a gliben - clamide - sensitive hyperpolarization induced by K 1 chan - nel openers and glucose deprivation in capillaries isolated from guinea pig hearts . Interestingly , evidence for a role of endothelial K ATP channels in the ﬂow - and shear stress - mediated vasodilatation has been presented ( 152 , 203 ) . The endothelium - dependent vasodilatation of coronary microvessels in response to an abluminal increase in os - molarity is signiﬁcantly attenuated by glibenclamide , but not by low concentrations of BaCl 2 that inhibit the inward rectiﬁer or by iberiotoxin , an inhibitor of K Ca channels ( 159 ) . However , the contribution of K ATP channels to EC function has been challenged in several reports ( for a review see Ref . 295 ) . Effects of K ATP blockers or activa - tors might instead be transmitted via myo - endothelial communication and originate from the vascular smooth muscle cells ( 264 ) . C . Amiloride - Sensitive Na 1 Channels Amiloride - sensitive Na 1 channels are essential for controlling Na 1 and ﬂuid transport in epithelia , but have also been described in endothelium ( 17 ) . These channels form a superfamily consisting of two TM helices , a short intracellular NH 2 and COOH terminus , and a long extra - cellular loop comprising two cysteine - rich domains . They have been described in microvascular endothelium , where they might be connected with water transport through aquaporin - 4 , and in cornea endothelium ( 9 , 254 ) . However , the expression pattern and also the functional impact of these channels in endothelium are not clear at all . D . Cl 2 Channels 1 . The volume - regulated anion channel , VRAC Like most mammalian cells , EC also express anion channels , which are mainly permeable for Cl 2 under physiological conditions and activated by classical “cell - swelling” protocols . They are referred to as volume - regu - lated anion channels ( VRAC ; Refs . 270 , 278 , 279 , 308 , 377 ) . Cell shrinkage reduces the basal current in EC below its ION CHANNELS IN VASCULAR ENDOTHELIUM 1431 Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m value in control conditions , indicating that VRAC is par - tially activated in resting cells and therefore important for the electrogenesis of the resting potential in nonstimu - lated cells ( 419 ) . VRAC is also activated by shear stress ( 11 , 266 ) . The swelling - activated Cl 2 current ( I Cl , swell ) shows outward rectiﬁcation and is time independent , except at potentials positive to 1 60 mV where it slowly inactivates . An increase in volume but also a reduction of intracellular ionic strength or dialysis of EC with GTP g S in isovolumic conditions are the main triggers for channel activation ( 281 , 286 , 423 , 424 ) . In hypotonic conditions , the current density of I Cl , swell at 1 100 mV ranges between 100 and 150 pA / pF in cultured endothelial cells ( 278 ) . However , the density is much smaller ( 40 pA / pS ) in freshly isolated EC and EC in primary culture ( 281 , 293 , 381 ) . The single - channel conductance is ; 40 – 50 pS at positive potentials and 10 – 20 pS at negative potentials ( 278 , 279 , 281 , 289 , 292 , 308 , 377 ) , indicating that rectiﬁcation is a property of the open channel . VRAC currents are mainly carried by Cl 2 but also amino acids and organic osmolytes permeate through the channel . The anion permeability sequence for VRAC is SCN 2 . I 2 . NO 3 2 . Br 2 . Cl 2 . HCO 3 2 . F 2 . gluconate . glycine . taurine . aspartate , gluta - mate . The permeability sequence for amino acids is con - sistent with that for the rates at which these amino acids are lost from cells during hyposmotic swelling . The pore diameter estimated from the ﬁt of the relative permeabili - ties of these anions to their Stoke’s diameter is ; 11 Å . A similar value has been obtained from the analysis of the voltage - dependent open channel block by molecules , like calixarenes and suramin , which block VRAC channels but also permeate at large driving forces ( 76 , 297 ) . VRAC is further characterized by inactivation at positive potentials and a voltage - dependent recovery from inactivation . Its kinetic properties are modulated by extracellular divalent cations , extracellular pH , the permeating anion itself , and various channel blockers . Inactivation is accelerated by acidic extracellular pH and by increasing the extracellular Mg 2 1 concentration ( 278 , 308 , 377 , 421 ) . The mechanism of VRAC gating is a matter of exten - sive research . In most experimental approaches VRAC is activated by hyposmotic cell swelling , but it can also be activated in isovolumic conditions by reducing intracellu - lar ionic strength at constant extracellular osmolality and intracellular Cl 2 concentration , a possible interpretation being an inﬂuence of ionic strength on protein tyrosine kinases ( 424 ) . Such a decrease in ionic strength is to be expected from the inﬂux of water during cell swelling ( 286 , 423 ) . Because these conditions are rather nonphysi - ological , the isovolumic activation , e . g . , by shear stress , may be more relevant for EC . Intracellular dialysis with GTP g S also activates VRAC without any increase in cell volume , an effect that is probably mediated via small G proteins ( 423 , 424 ) . A possible candidate is the GTP - hydrolyzing RhoA - GTPase , since VRAC is downregulated in cells pretreated with the p21RhoA inactivating Clostridium limosum exoenzyme C3 , and enhanced by cytotoxic necrosis factor ( CNF1 ) , a bacterial toxin that constitutively activates Rho GTPases . Inhibition of the RhoA - associated protein kinase , a possi - ble downstream target of p21 RhoA , with the speciﬁc blocker Y - 27632 also downregulates VRAC ( 277 , 298 ) . A tyrosine phosphorylation step downstream of the Rho - signaling cascade may be critical for the swelling - induced activation of the channel , since inhibitors of protein ty - rosine kinases inhibit VRAC and the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors Na 3 VO 4 and dephosphatin poten - tiate it . It has been shown recently that the tyrosine kinase p56lck mediates activation of the swelling - induced Cl 2 currents in lymphocytes ( 212 ) . Figure 10 shows a typical example for activation of VRAC and a tentative gating scheme of this channel . Part of the activation cascade of VRAC seems to be coupled to specialized cytoskeletal structures . The an - nexin II - p11 complex , which is part of the cortical cy - toskeleton and involved in the formation of caveolae , is important for activation of endothelial VRAC ( 280 ) . The current density of VRAC correlates with the content of CAV - 1 in various cell types . CAV - 1 is the major protein in caveolae , and linked to many other signaling proteins ( see sect . VIII B3 ) . In cells devoid of CAV - 1 , such as the cancer cells FRT , MCF - 7 , T47D , and CaCo2 , VRAC has a very low current density ( 391 ) , suggesting that targeting of VRAC to caveolae may provide a microdomain for activation . The pharmacology of VRAC is quite extensively stud - ied , and the search for more selective high - afﬁnity block - ers is still underway . There is a huge variety of com - pounds that inhibit VRAC with moderate afﬁnity ( EC 50 between 1 and 1 , 000 m M ) and speciﬁcity . Among these compounds are not only several classical Cl 2 channel blockers , such as DIDS , SITS , N - phenylanthranilic acid ( NPA ) , 9 - aminocamptothecic acid ( 9 - AC ) , NPPB , and ni - ﬂumic acid , but also several “surprising” substances , such as the P - glycoprotein inhibitors tamoxifen , 1 , 9 - dideoxy - forskolin , verapamil ( 281 ) , quinine and quinidine ( 422 ) , antiallergic drugs from the chromone family ( 134 ) , Ins ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) P 4 and Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) P 4 ( 285 ) , the antihyperten - sive Ca 2 1 - antagonist mibefradil ( 283 ) , and the widely used antidepressant drug ﬂuoxetine , supposed to be a selective serotonin ( 5 - hydroxytryptamine ) reuptake in - hibitor ( 231 ) . Most of these voltage - independent blockers are relatively hydrophobic aromatic compounds , which can easily permeate the cell membrane . It has been shown that quinine , quinidine , and ﬂuoxetine , which can be both positively charged and neutral , exert their blocking effect at nanomolar concentrations of the neutral form , support - ing the idea that these blockers interact with VRAC within the plasma membrane . Many of these blockers are pro - pylamines with a - CF 3 group , a group of compounds that 1432 BERND NILIUS AND GUY DROOGMANS Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m may comprise promising candidates for highly selective VRAC blockers ( 347 ) . Additionally , phenol derivatives , such as gossypol , a polyphenolic pigment found in cotton plants , are generally rather potent blockers of VRAC ( for a review , see Ref . 297 ) . In addition to these voltage - independent blockers , several compounds that contain sulfonyl groups have been shown to block VRAC almost exclusively at positive potentials . This group contains the classical Cl 2 channel blockers DIDS and SITS , as well as the family of calix - arenes , para - substituted phenols conjugated by methyl - enes to form macrocyclic basket ( calix ) - like molecules . Calix [ 4 ] arenes induce a voltage - dependent inhibition of I Cl , swell , probably by occluding the pore region at moder - ate positive potentials , but this block is relieved at more positive potentials where the negatively charged calix [ 4 ] arene permeates the channel . Lowering external pH potentiates the effect of calix [ 4 ] arenes , suggesting a role for positively charged residues , presumably histidine , within the channel pore . A similar voltage - dependent block can be induced by negatively charged compounds , including suramin , reactive blue ( basilen blue ) , calix [ 6 , 8 ] - FIG . 10 . Activation of VRAC by cell swelling . A : time course of VRAC activa - tion and deactivation at 2 80 mV in a BPAEC . The bar indicates the applica - tion of a solution with 25 % lower osmo - lality than the control solution . This hy - potonic challenge induces cell swelling ( 419 ) .

D : tentative gating scheme of VRAC , which is discussed in detail in the text and in References 275 , 284 , 286 , 295 , 296 , 419 . ION CHANNELS IN VASCULAR ENDOTHELIUM 1433 Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m arenes , and other compounds carrying sulfonic acidic sites . The voltage - dependent block of VRAC by ATP is probably also due to a similar mechanism . The blocking effect of these compounds is enhanced by lowering ex - tracellular pH and at moderate positive membrane poten - tials . The relief of the blocking effect at positive potentials is only observed for compounds small enough to perme - ate the pore . Calix [ 6 ] arene and calix [ 8 ] arene are appar - ently not able to permeate the VRAC pore , from which a pore diameter between 1 and 1 . 6 nm has been estimated , a value in the same range as the values obtained above ( 76 , 77 ) . The molecular nature of the VRAC channel is still unknown , and the putative candidates so far have been disputed . P - glycoprotein , the product of the multidrug resistance 1 gene which functions as a drug transporter and possibly as an anion channel , has been proposed as a putative candidate for VRAC , but now even its role as a regulator of VRAC is questioned . A second candidate for VRAC is pI Cln , whereby n refers to a putative extracellular nucleotide - blocking site . Because the primary amino acid sequence of pI Cln lacks transmembrane helices , it has been proposed that the pI Cln “channel” is a homodimer consisting of four b - strands which form an eight - stranded , antiparallel b - barrel transmembrane pore similar to that of porins . The most compelling evidence for pI Cln being a plasma membrane channel is the presence of a GXGXG motif , being an essential component of the extracellular nucle - otide binding site believed to be essential for the nucleo - tide sensitivity of the VRAC current . It has been reported that mutations of this site ( G54A ; G56A ; G58A ) prevent current inhibition by extracellular nucleotides , but these data could not be reproduced , which undermines the idea that pI Cln is VRAC ( 418 ) . Recently , it has been shown that pI Cln is a cytosolic rather than a membrane protein that probably binds spliceosomes and regulates protein im - port into the nucleus ( 338 ) . pI Cln also interacts with a homolog of the p21 ( Cdc42 / Rac ) - activated protein kinases ( PAKs ) . The involvement of PAKs in cytoskeletal rear - rangement suggests that pI Cln may be linked to a system regulating cell morphology ( 201 ) . ClC - 3 , a membrane protein of the ClC family , is cur - rently considered as a candidate for VRAC . These chan - nels are opened by cell swelling or by inhibition of endog - enous PKC , but closed by PKC activation , phosphatase inhibition , or elevation of intracellular Ca 2 1 . Site - speciﬁc mutational studies indicate that a serine residue ( serine - 51 ) within a consensus PKC phosphorylation site in the intracellular NH 2 terminus of the ClC - 3 channel protein represents an important volume sensor of the channel . These results provide direct molecular and pharmacolog - ical evidence for channel phosphorylation / dephosphory - lation ( 78 , 79 , 450 ) . However , endothelial VRAC channels lack these properties , and it is therefore unlikely that ClC - 3 is responsible for the swelling - activated Cl 2 chan - nel in EC . ClC - 2 is obviously volume sensitive , but its biophys - ical and pharmacological properties are completely dif - ferent from those of VRAC . Also another candidate , the 72 - amino acid intrinsic membrane protein phospholem - man with a single membrane - spanning domain , is obvi - ously not VRAC ( detailed discussion in Ref . 278 ) . The enigmatic molecular nature of VRAC does how - ever not prevent us from speculating about its possible functions in EC . Because VRAC is a “housekeeping” Cl 2 channel , its block induces changes in the membrane potential of EC . If these Cl 2 channels are blocked , K 1 channels may be - come dominant and strongly hyperpolarize the membrane with potentially beneﬁcial effects on agonist or shear stress - induced Ca 2 1 inﬂux . Block of Cl 2 channels may therefore be a strongly underestimated tool to modulate the driving force for Ca 2 1 entry in EC and hence Ca 2 1 signaling ( 283 , 297 ) . VRAC can also be activated by mechanical forces ( shear stress , biaxial tensile stress ) that induce changes in cell shape and possibly folding and unfolding of the plasma membrane ( 11 , 266 , 277 , 278 , 295 , 297 ) . This func - tion might be especially important for EC that sense mechanical forces , a process in which a RhoA - mediated pathway may be involved ( see sect . VI ) . Activation of RhoA inhibits myosin light - chain phosphatases ( MLCP ) via a Rho / Rho - associated kinase ( ROK ) , a pathway that has been shown to modulate VRAC in cultured BPAEC . One of the downstream effects is an increased myosin light - chain phosphorylation , raising the possibility of a functional link between myosin light - chain phosphoryla - tion and VRAC activation . Application of myosin light - chain kinase ( MLCK ) inhibitors , including AV25 , a speciﬁc MLCK inhibitory peptide , inhibits preactivated VRAC . Cell dialysis with a speciﬁc inhibitory peptide of MLCP , NIPP1 - ( 191 O 210 ) , potentiates the activation of VRAC . These results indicate that myosin phosphorylation is a prerequisite for efﬁcient activation of VRAC in BPAEC cells and might be involved in the mechano - sensing path - way of VRAC by connecting the gating machinery to the cytoskeleton ( 288 ) . VRAC is supposed to regulate EC proliferation . Chemically completely different compounds that inhibit VRAC also inhibit in the same concentration range serum - induced EC proliferation and [ 3 H ] thymidine incorporation ( 278 , 279 , 283 , 425 ) . As discussed in section VIII E , VRAC blockers also inhibit angiogenesis . Interestingly , VRAC is downregulated if cells switch from proliferation to differ - entiation ( 237 , 426 ) , which may also explain the different current densities of VRAC in primary cultured and freshly isolated cells ( 381 ) . Thus VRAC could assist in regulating EC growth and the transition from proliferation to differ - entiation . 1434 BERND NILIUS AND GUY DROOGMANS Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m In addition , VRAC may also contribute to the control of intracellular pH homeostasis ( 282 , 351 ) . Interestingly , activation of VRAC induces a decrease in intracellular pH ( pH i ) ( 282 ) . A decrease in pH i stimulates prostanoid syn - thesis in EC from cerebral microvessel , which is possibly mediated directly via a protein phosphorylation - depen - dent mechanism involving protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases as well as PKC . cPLA 2 is the key enzyme affected by a decreased pH i ( 319 ) . Therefore , this mech - anism could also link channel activity ( VRAC ) to the production of vasoactive compounds . 2 . Ca 2 1 - dependent Cl 2 channels , CaCC or CLCA The increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i during stimulation of EC ex - erts depending on the cell type two distinct effects on membrane potential . In some EC , it is accompanied by a prominent hyperpolarization due to activation of Ca 2 1 - dependent K 1 channels , but in others , such as BPAEC , it evokes only small changes in membrane potential due to activation of Ca 2 1 - dependent Cl 2 channels ( CaCC ; Refs . 123 , 138 , 179 , 284 , 287 ) . These channels inactivate rapidly at negative potentials and activate slowly at positive po - tentials . Outward tail currents are slowly decaying , while inward tail currents decay much faster ( 284 , 287 ) . They show strong outward rectiﬁcation . The permeability ratio for anions is I 2 : Cl 2 : gluconate 5 1 . 7 : 1 : 0 . 4 ( 283 ) . The sin - gle - channel conductance is ; 7 pS at 300 mM extracellular Cl 2 but only ; 3 pS at physiological intra - and extracellu - lar Cl 2 concentrations ( 283 , 287 ) . Typical current densi - ties of these Ca 2 1 - activated Cl 2 currents range from 10 – 30 pA / pF at 1 100 mV and are thus much smaller than those of the volume - activated Cl 2 currents . The channel open probability is high at positive potentials , but very small at negative potentials . [ Ca 2 1 ] i for half - maximal ac - tivation is voltage dependent and ranges from 400 to 600 nM at 2 100 mV to 50 – 80 nM at 1 80 mV , pointing to high - afﬁnity binding sites for Ca 2 1 . Steady - state and ki - netic behavior of this current can be described by a model which assumes activation of the channel by two identical , independent , sequential Ca 2 1 binding steps preceding a ﬁnal Ca 2 1 - independent transition from the closed to the open state of the channel . The putative binding site for Ca 2 1 is ; 10 – 15 % within the membrane electric ﬁeld from the cytoplasmic side ( 7 , 287 ) . Current activation requires intracellular ATP ( 438 ) . NPA , DIDS , Zn 2 1 , and calmodulin antagonists ( 123 , 284 , 287 ) block CaCC currents . Inhibition by DIDS and niﬂu - mic acid is voltage dependent and more potent at positive potentials . The block by NPA , NPPB , and tamoxifen is voltage independent . Niﬂumic acid and tamoxifen are the most potent blockers . The molecular nature of this channel is not yet re - solved . Recently , a number of related membrane proteins have been cloned including the endothelial adhesion pro - tein Lu - ECAM , the bovine bCLCA1 , murine mCLCA1 , and human hCLCA1 , - 2 , and - 3 proteins that are believed to represent putative Cl 2 channels . Currents , showing some similarity with CaCC , have been observed in HEK cells expressing these proteins . These Ca 2 1 - sensitive Cl 2 cur - rents , activated by extremely high , nonphysiological con - centrations of [ Ca 2 1 ] i , are outwardly rectifying and inhib - ited by DIDS , dithiothreitol , and niﬂumic acid . Cell - attached patch recordings of transfected cells reveal single channels with a slope conductance of 13 . 4 pS . These ﬁndings suggest that members of the CLCA family represent a Ca 2 1 - activated Cl 2 conductance . Proteins of this family are characterized by a precursor of ; 130 kDa consisting of between 900 and 940 amino acid residues . This precursor is cleaved to form heterodimers of ; 90 and 35 kDa . The most likely topology is ﬁve TM with an extracellular glycosylated NH 2 terminus , containing a number of conserved cysteine residues and an intracellu - lar COOH terminus . The above - mentioned cleavage site is located in the intracellular loop between TM3 and TM4 . The proteins contain several consensus sites for PKC phosphorylation ( 105 , 126 – 128 ) . RT - PCR shows a high expression of mCLCA1 in mouse aorta EC . However , so far we failed to record CaCC - like currents in cells ex - pressing mCLCA1 and bCLCA1 ( 287 ; B . Nilius and J . Papassotiriou , unpublished data ) . A Ca 2 1 - activated Cl 2 channel with properties clearly different from the above - described CaCC can be activated by a Ca 2 1 / CaM - dependent protein kinase II . Interestingly , this channel is inhibited by Ins ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) P 4 , an endogenous inositol tetrakisphosphate that also inhibits Ca 2 1 - stimulated Cl 2 secretion . The effect seems to be speciﬁc for that par - ticular isoform , since Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) P 4 , Ins ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 4 , Ins ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 ) P 4 , and inositol 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 - pentakisphosphate [ Ins ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) P 5 ] [ the latter being the immediate precursor of Ins ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) P 4 ] are all ineffective ( 444 ) . 3 . High - conductance Cl 2 channels Occasionally , high - conductance Cl 2 channels ( B Cl ) , which are obviously different from all other described Cl 2 channels , have been observed in EC . These channels are virtually silent in intact cells or in cell - attached patches , but become active in excised inside - out and outside - out patches . Their single - channel conductance ranges from 113 to 400 pS , and they exhibit several subconductance states , which probably refers to a multi - barrel structure ( 125 , 310 , 340 , 395 , 397 ) . B Cl is activated upon b - adrener - gic stimulation in EC , which phosphorylates the channel and shifts its activation range toward more negative po - tentials ( 397 ) . It is also activated by the antiestrogen tamoxifen and inhibited by 17 b - estradiol . This effect has been discussed in relation to the protective effect of estrogens on several cardiovascular diseases ( 218 ) . A pro - longed increase in intracellular Ca 2 1 , as well as inhibition ION CHANNELS IN VASCULAR ENDOTHELIUM 1435 Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m of PKC , seems to increase the incidence of the channel in cell - attached patches . Zn 2 1 from either side of the mem - brane blocks the channel ( 125 ) . The physiological rele - vance of these channels is elusive . 4 . CFTR in endothelium ? A multitude of Cl 2 channel types has been charac - terized in EC , but until recently , no clear evidence for cAMP - stimulated CFTR channels had been presented . Tousson et al . ( 388 ) reported expression of CFTR in EC from umbilical vein and lung microvasculature at both the messenger and protein level , as well as functional expres - sion from Cl 2 efﬂux and whole cell patch - clamp data . cAMP - stimulated Cl 2 currents in these cells were not blocked by DIDS , but sensitive to glibenclamide indica - tive of CFTR Cl 2 channel activity . CFTR channels have so far not been observed in cultured BPAEC cells ( 294 ) , but a functional interaction with other Cl 2 channels has been observed if they are heterologously expressed in these cells . Overexpression of CFTR downregulates VRAC in an activity - independent manner , but expression of the nonmaturating mutant D F508 - CFTR does not . Because neither the single - channel conductance nor the kinetics of macroscopic currents are affected , CFTR probably downregulates the number of functional VRAC channels ( 410 ) . Also CaCC is downregu - lated by CFTR , but this effect is potentiated by a cAMP - mediated activation of CFTR ( 439 ) . A functional role for CFTR in EC biology is not clear , but like in epithelial cells , it could be involved in transendothelial transport and act as a regulator of other channels or transporters . Interest - ingly , CFTR has been associated with ATP transport ( 169 , 367 , 368 ) . ATP and its metabolites , such as adenosine , are important autacoid and paracrine substances that affect many functions of the vessel wall ( 273 ) . E . Conclusion The membrane potential of EC is modulated by a variety of ion channels . K 1 channels , which are constitu - tively open ( Kir type channels ) or which are activated during EC stimulation ( BK Ca , IK Ca , SK Ca , K ATP ) , induce hyperpolarization . Interestingly , EC express also a variety of Cl 2 channels ( VRAC , CLCA , CFTR ) whose inhibition can also induce EC hyperpolarization . Activation of these channels during EC stimulation may clamp the EC mem - brane potential at negative potentials close to the equilib - rium potential for Cl 2 ( E Cl ) . Importantly , K 1 and Cl 2 channels interacting with cation channels induce some - times dramatic stepwise or oscillatory changes in the EC membrane potential of up to 80 mV . Channels regulating EC electrogenesis or inducing changes in the membrane potential due to hormonal , neuronal , and mechanical stimuli importantly inﬂuence several mechanisms . 1 ) They regulate the driving force for Ca 2 1 entry via several pathways and add positive and negative feedback mech - anisms to the numerous regulation mechanisms inherent to EC for controlling Ca 2 1 inﬂux . 2 ) They might be the main players in transducing electrical signals such as ﬂow - dependent hyperpolarization to neighboring EC and smooth muscle cells ( SMC ) , thereby regulating the func - tional state in blood vessels upstream and downstream of sites of EC activation . 3 ) They control the driving force for several electrogenic transporters such as NCX . 4 ) An increasing number of events in EC are likely dependent on the polarization state of EC without interference of Ca 2 1 , e . g . , depolarization - induced superoxide formation ( see sect . VIII F ) . 5 ) Some channels , such as VRAC , might be important , in addition to regulation of electrogenesis , for the transport of amino acids , organic osmolytes , and HCO 3 2 , which is important for regulation of the intracel - lular pH in EC . V . VOLTAGE - DEPENDENT ION CHANNELS IN ENDOTHELIUM ? EC are nonexcitable , and it is therefore difﬁcult to reconcile the presence of voltage - gated ion channels with the slow and often small changes in membrane potential in these cells . Several reports have nevertheless clearly shown the incidence of voltage - gated ion channels in both cultured and freshly isolated EC . Voltage - activated Na 1 channels with a low tetrodotoxin and high saxitoxin sen - sitivity have been observed in EC from human umbilical vein , in rat interlobar arterial EC , and in microvascular EC ( 114 , 429 ) . These currents are also present in primary cultures of microvascular EC , however at a rather small density ( 2 . 1 pA / pF at 0 mV ) . At the normal resting poten - tial of EC , ; 50 % or more of these channels will be inac - tivated . Stimulation of PKC increases this current without any change in its voltage dependence ( 429 ) . Voltage - gated Ca 2 1 channels , which share some sim - ilarities with the classical L - and T - type Ca 2 1 channels , have been described in freshly dissociated capillary EC from bovine adrenal glands ( 34 – 36 , 417 ) . Their voltage dependence , kinetics , responses to BAY K 8644 , nifedi - pine , amiloride , and Cd 2 1 , and their different selectivity for Ba 2 1 and Ca 2 1 indicate that the observed currents are typical T and L channels resembling those of endocrine secretory cells ( 417 ) . The “T - type” Ca 2 1 channels have a conductance of ; 8 pS and are involved in depolarization - induced Ca 2 1 transients , which may suggest a role in endothelial Ca 2 1 signaling . L - type Ca 2 1 channels in these EC have a single - channel conductance of ; 20 pS and are sensitive to dihydropyridines . In addition to these two voltage - dependent Ca 2 1 channels , a tiny conductance channel ( SB Ca 2 1 channel , 2 . 8 pS in 110 mM Ba 2 1 ) has been observed in capillary EC . It is sensitive to the Ca 2 1 1436 BERND NILIUS AND GUY DROOGMANS Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m agonist BAY K 8644 , but not to the Ca 2 1 antagonist nicar - dipine ( 35 ) . This channel shows long openings at negative potentials and might provide a low - threshold Ca 2 1 entry pathway . A novel type of voltage - dependent Ca 2 1 chan - nel , the R - type Ca 2 1 channel , has been proposed to be important during activation of EC by PAF ( 30 ) . This chan - nel , which is activated by a long - lasting depolarization and does not inactivate at depolarized potentials , has also been proposed as a possible candidate for a sustained Ca 2 1 inﬂux . A hyperpolarization - activated , nonselective cation channel that carries K 1 and Na 1 and is modulated by NO has been described in vascular brain EC ( 165 ) , but its physiological role is completely unknown . A 4 - aminopyr - idine - sensitive , voltage - dependent , transient outward cur - rent ( A - type K 1 channel ) has been described in cultured EC ( 173 , 382 ) . In freshly isolated EC from resistance vessels , a delayed rectiﬁer K 1 current has been observed that is probably Kv1 . 5 and might be involved in release of vasoactive compounds ( 143 ) . Dittrich et al . ( 72 ) describe a voltage - dependent current in freshly isolated EC from heart capillaries that activates at potentials positive to 2 20 mV and inactivates much slower than A currents at positive potentials . This current is blocked by TEA but is insensitive to charybdotoxin and apamin . This 12 - pS channel is different from HERG channels or Shaker - type K 1 channels . The functional role of this channel , sup - posed to be involved in the generation of oscillations in membrane potential and [ Ca 2 1 ] i , remains hypothetical . VI . MECHANOSENSITIVE CHANNELS IN ENDOTHELIUM EC are notorious for their ability to sense mechanical forces , such as biaxial tensile stress ( stretch , pressure ) , a force component mainly vertical to the EC surface , and shear stress , a tangential force due to blood ﬂow ( for detailed reviews , see Ref . 211 ) . Many endothelial re - sponses are modulated by changes in blood ﬂow and blood pressure : 1 ) the secretion of prostacyclin ( PGI 2 ) and endothelium - derived relaxing factor ( EDRF ; and NO ) ; 2 ) the expression of genes and proteins , such as tPA , plasminogen - activator inhibitor ( PAI - 1 ) , tissue factor ( TF ) , several adhesion molecules ( VCAM - 1 , the intercel - lular adhesion protein - 1 ) , growth inhibitors ( heparin ) , growth factors ( platelet - derived growth factor , PDGF ) , endothelin , monocyte - chemoattractant protein ( MCP - 1 ) , NO synthase , and activation of early response genes and small G proteins ; 3 ) cell cycle entry ; and 4 ) cytoskeletal rearrangement , long - term responses , such as adaptive changes in cytoskeleton , vessel remodeling , and others ( 64 , 66 , 232 ) . Shear stress also upregulates expression of the con - nexin ( Cx ) 43 ( 70 , 69 , 104 , 182 , 205 ) . Some mechanisms , such as the mechanically induced stimulation of DNA binding activities of nuclear factor k B ( NF k B ) and the nuclear factor activator protein - 1 ( AP - 1 , AP - 2 ) ( 206 ) , have been elucidated . Shear stress can di - rectly activate cis - elements of different genes , e . g . , the shear stress response element in the PDGF - B gene and the tPA - responsive element in the MCP - 1 gene , and can stimulate the GC - rich transcription - initiation site of the speciﬁcity protein 1 ( Sp - 1 ) in the TF gene . Protein kinases appear to be involved in an early step of mechanosensing . Shear stress induces a fast tyrosine phosphorylation at the luminal side of EC , primarily in caveolae and also supports translocation of signaling pro - teins to caveolae ( 345 ) . Gene activation is modulated by a complex network of protein kinases ( JKN , ERK , focal adhesion kinases FAK , c - src ) , which might be affected by changes in the ionic conditions and [ Ca 2 1 ] i . ( 23 , 53 – 56 ) . Changes in [ Ca 2 1 ] i are also important for the regula - tion of gene expression ( 189 , 217 ) , since the shear stress - mediated Ca 2 1 responses activate protein kinases , e . g . , the functionally important upregulation of eNOS in re - sponse to shear stress depends on an initial Ca 2 1 - depen - dent phosphorylation step ( 93 ) . The initial fast release of NO in response to mechanical forces is therefore Ca 2 1 dependent , whereas the sustained NO production is Ca 2 1 independent ( 42 , 71 , 93 , 263 ) . Receptor tyrosine kinases and integrins can serve as mechanosensors ( e . g . , the vitronectin receptor avb3 ) by acting through several kinases including FAK . Interest - ingly , shear stress induces the translocation of Cdc42 and Rho from the cytosol to the plasma membrane , a mecha - nism that might be also involved in VRAC gating ( see sect . IV C1 and Refs . 53 , 216 ) . An intriguing example for the role of tyrosine phosphorylation and the interference of [ Ca 2 1 ] i is the role of the p130 Crk - associated substrate ( Cas ) , a c - Src substrate , which has been identiﬁed as a highly phosphorylated protein localized to focal adhe - sions and acting as an adapter protein . Cas is important for actin ﬁlament assembly and is tyrosine - phosphory - lated by shear stress via activation of the Ca 2 1 - dependent c - Src . This involvement of Ca 2 1 in activation of c - Src and tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas deﬁnes a novel mechano - sensing mechanism ( 309 ) . Ion channels may serve as effective mechanosensors to convert mechanical forces into electrical responses . It is not clear how ion channels may be directly involved in the responses to mechanical forces . Obviously , changes in [ Ca 2 1 ] i might again be an important transmitter of the mechanical signal . We therefore ﬁrst discuss the mechan - ically induced changes in [ Ca 2 1 ] i and afterward the chan - nels responding to mechanical forces . VRAC or VRAC - like channels may also belong to this class of channels be - cause they can be obviously activated by shear stress and membrane stretch , induced by positive pressure in the patch pipette .

Mechanically Induced Ca 2 1 Entry Mechanostimulation of isolated EC by shear stress , stretch , or swelling in Ca 2 1 - free solutions induces an increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i ( 266 , 305 ) . Acute changes in ﬂow also induce Ca 2 1 release from Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - sensitive pools and a subsequent NO release ( 153 ) . Pretreatment of EC with thapsigargin attenuates this Ca 2 1 release , indicating that the mechanical stimulus induces a release of Ca 2 1 from Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - sensitive stores . However , neither the PLC pathway nor Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 are involved , since the PLC in - hibitor neomycin and the Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 receptor antagonist heparin do not block this release . Also the PKA inhibitory peptide as well as cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhi - bition is ineffective ( 305 ) . Because PLA 2 blockers inhibit the release and arachidonic acid mimics the effect of mechanostimulation even in the presence of heparin and PLA 2 blockers , it has been proposed that the mechani - cally induced release of Ca 2 1 is mediated via production of arachidonic acid . The depletion of endothelial Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - sensitive Ca 2 1 stores by mechanical stimulation may also activate Ca 2 1 entry via store - operated Ca 2 1 entry channels ( 269 , 305 ) . Recently , a mechanosensitive Ca 2 1 - permeable chan - nel with a relative permeability of P Ca : P Na : P K 5 5 : 1 : 1 has been described in freshly isolated EC from rat aorta and also in the ECV304 cell line ( 451 ) . This channel is acti - vated by stretch ( negative pressure in inside - out patches ) , but its activity correlates with a shear stress - induced Ca 2 1 signal . Single - channel conductance is 32 pS for monova - lent cations and 9 pS for Ca 2 1 . This channel is inhibited by PKG , initiating a negative feedback by activation of eNOS . 1 . Channels activated by tensile stress Membrane stretch induced by negative pressure ap - plied via the patch pipette to cell - attached patches on EC activates a channel that is permeable for monovalent cations ( ; 50 pS ) and Ca 2 1 ( 19 pS ) ( 209 ) . Stretch - acti - vated NSC with a conductance of 20 – 30 pS for monova - lent cations and 10 – 20 pS for Ca 2 1 and Ba 2 1 have also been described in endocardial endothelium and microvas - cular EC ( 147 , 335 ) . Activation of these channels induces an increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i that is sufﬁcient to activate BK Ca and to hyperpolarize the membrane . Interestingly , BK Ca itself is sensitized to [ Ca 2 1 ] i when stretch ( negative pres - sure ) is applied to inside - out patches ( 148 , 195 , 233 ) . Hoyer et al . ( 149 ) have described a K 1 - selective stretch - activated channel in rat intact aortic endothelium and isolated aortic EC with a similar permeability for K 1 and Na 1 . Its single - channel conductance is 22 pS for K 1 and Na 1 and 4 pS for Ca 2 1 . Channel activity is clearly pres - sure dependent in a physiological range and disappears during application of 20 m M gadolinium . Opening of the pressure - activated cation channel ( PAC ) is followed by the opening of a Ca 2 1 - dependent NSC , indicating that Ca 2 1 inﬂux through PAC may be sufﬁcient to increase intracellular Ca 2 1 and to activate thereby neighboring NSCs ( see sect . III A ) . This channel is upregulated in reno - vascular hypertension and in spontaneous hypertensive rats ( 195 ) . Marchenko and Sage ( 242 , 243 ) described a similar pressure - activated NSC with a conductance of 34 pS for monovalent cations and 6 pS for Ca 2 1 , which provides an inﬂux pathway for Ca 2 1 . Indirect evidence for a functional role of these stretch - activated channels has been obtained from experiments in which Gd 3 1 , an efﬁ - cient blocker of mechanosensitive channels , has been used to inhibit NO synthesis ( 379 ) . Although not directly activated by biaxial tension , voltage - dependent K 1 channels are upregulated by appli - cation of static and cyclic stretch , indicating a role of these channels in mechanotransduction of cardiac micro - vascular EC ( 86 ) . 2 . Channels activated by shear stress Shear stress - induced activation of endothelial ion channels represents one of the earliest responses in mechanosignal transduction , which is important for the regulation of vascular tone . Several examples of ion chan - nels directly activated by shear stress have been reported , although most experimental conditions cannot exclude a stretch component . It is therefore sometimes difﬁcult to distinguish between these two forces and their role in channel activation . HAEC respond to ﬂow with Ca 2 1 entry , activation of NSC , Cl 2 channels , and Ca 2 1 - activated K 1 channels . Con - versely , similar ﬂow rates do not affect human capillary EC . The increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i in macrovascular EC depends on the presence of extracellular Ca 2 1 ( 171 ) , but it is not clear which entry channels are responsible for these changes in [ Ca 2 1 ] i . A possible candidate is a shear stress - activated NSC , which is slightly more permeable for Ca 2 1 than Na 1 , and reversibly blocked by La 3 1 . It is insensitive to activators of protein kinase and inhibited by nonsteroi - dal anti - inﬂammatory drugs , such as mefenamic acid ( 266 , 364 , 365 ) . Other channels , modulated by shear stress , may reg - ulate the driving force for Ca 2 1 . However , these channels can only be effective if at the same time a Ca 2 1 pathway is activated , e . g . , if mechanical stimulation opens CCE channels ( 305 , 306 ) . Changes in [ Ca 2 1 ] i in human aorta EC are modulated by shear stress - activated Cl 2 channels , most likely VRAC . In BAEC , ﬂow induces an initial hyper - polarization , which is followed by a sustained depolariza - tion , caused by activation of Cl 2 channels . Thus shear stress - dependent Cl 2 channels may be important modu - lators of endothelial mechanosensitivity ( 11 , 266 ) . Changes in shear stress due to pulsatile ﬂow or by varying 1438 BERND NILIUS AND GUY DROOGMANS Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m the viscosity activate SK Ca and BK Ca channels ( 64 , 65 , 152 ) . Opening of these K 1 channels induces hyperpolar - ization , which may increase Ca 2 1 inﬂux and NO release , and also modulate the membrane potential in smooth muscle cells electrically coupled to the endothelium ( 63 , 64 , 295 ) . An inwardly rectifying , 30 - pS K 1 channel has been described as a possible mechanosensor of shear stress ( 163 , 312 ) . Its single - channel conductance , its de - gree of rectiﬁcation , and its Ca 2 1 sensitivity in excised patches suggest that this channel may belong to the class of SK Ca channels . These channels share some properties with ROMK - like channels , and the previously described Ca 2 1 - and GTP - modulated inwardly rectifying K 1 chan - nels ( 301 , 302 , 311 , 401 ) , but clearly differ from the clas - sical IRK channels ( see sect . IV A1 ) . PTX - sensitive mecha - nisms , cGMP , and NO seem to be involved in the activation of shear stress - dependent K 1 channels ( 133 , 302 ) . The observation that various blockers of K 1 chan - nels reduce shear stress - mediated release of NO provides indirect evidence for the involvement of these channels ( 5 , 70 , 376 ) . Another mechanosensitive ion channel participating in EC responses to shear stress is surprisingly a voltage - gated Na 1 channel ( see sect . V ) . The activation of the shear stress - mediated extracellular signal - regulated ki - nase ( ERK1 / 2 ) is potentiated by substituting extracellular [ Na 1 ] with N - methyl - D - glucamine ( NMDG 1 ) and by the voltage - gated Na 1 channel antagonist tetrodotoxin . Evi - dence for the expression of the Na 1 channel genes SCN4a and SCN8a a - subunit genes in these EC has been ob - tained from RT - PCR analysis and is supported by Western blotting of a 250 - kDa protein with Na 1 channel antibodies ( 390 ) . These results may indicate that Na 1 channels are involved in regulation of shear stress - mediated ERK1 / 2 activation . Because of the low membrane potential and the slow changes in membrane polarization , it is difﬁcult to reconcile this interpretation with activation of voltage - dependent Na 1 channels . B . Conclusion A variety of mechanosensitive ion channels have been identiﬁed at the functional level in various types of EC . However , none of them has been identiﬁed at the molecular level . It is also difﬁcult to identify such mech - anosensitive channels with already described types of ion channels . Mechanosensitivity is inherent to several types of ion channels among which Ca 2 1 - permeable cation channels that provide Ca 2 1 entry pathways in EC , differ - ent types of K 1 channels , and also Cl 2 channels . There - fore , mechanical forces modulate not only Ca 2 1 entry , but the membrane potential is also a target of the mechano - sensing machinery of EC . The signal transduction be - tween mechanical stimulus and gating or modulation of the respective ion channels is not yet understood . VII . GAP JUNCTIONAL CHANNELS Gap junctions are agglomerates of cell - to - cell chan - nels that allow direct electrical and metabolic communi - cation between endothelial cells , between EC and SMC , and also between EC and lymphocytes / monocytes ( 67 ) . An extensive description of EC - EC , EC - SMC , and EC - blood cell coupling is beyond the scope of this review . In short , coupling of EC consists of clublike protrusions , which contact neighboring smooth muscle cells through the basement membrane ( 344 ) . The large variability of functional low - resistance cell - cell connections may de - pend on the presence of various isoforms of connexins . At least three isoforms ( Cx37 , - 40 , - 43 ) are expressed in EC and may give rise to heterogeneous expression patterns . Cx43 is more abundant in macrovascular than in micro - vascular cells . Aortic and pulmonary arterial endothelia express all three types of connexin , whereas coronary artery endothelium expresses Cx40 and Cx37 but lacks Cx43 ( 68 , 221 , 453 ) . Functional channels can be formed between the same or different isoforms . Interaction does not occur between the Cx40 and Cx43 isoforms , but pos - sibly between Cx40 or Cx43 and Cx37 ( 40 ) . Cx40 is prom - inent in cultured EC . The single gap junctional channel conductance in HUVEC is in the range of 19 – 75 pS , but in cultured human aorta EC , an additional conductance of 80 – 200 pS has been observed . The latter may possibly reﬂect the activity of Cx40 isoform channels , which are more abundant in cultured arterial endothelial cells ( 405 ) . Expression of connexins depends on the functional state of EC and is modulated by growth factors , by factors that are present during inﬂammation ( TNF - a ) , and by mechan - ical forces ( 68 , 326 , 327 , 443 ) . Connexins play an impor - tant role in the regulation of inﬂammatory responses with a main target on EC , including cell extravasation and changes in vessel permeability . The normal expression pattern of connexins is disturbed in the presence of TNF - a , a major regulator of inﬂammatory reactions , which downregulates Cx37 and Cx40 expression , but does not alter that of Cx43 , and attenuates EC coupling ( 406 ) . The electrical coupling between EC is the morpho - logical substrate for the electrotonic spread of electrical signals along the vessel wall . Electrical coupling via high - conductance gap junctional channels between EC and smooth muscle cells may be functionally important in EC of small - terminal arterioles where a large total EC surface contacts a much smaller smooth muscle surface and al - lows an efﬁcient modulation of the smooth muscle mem - brane potential by the EC ( 20 , 63 , 67 ) . In contrast , other results show that the agonist - induced hyperpolarization ION CHANNELS IN VASCULAR ENDOTHELIUM 1439 Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m of EC does not spread electrotonically to smooth muscle cells , but rather the opposite happens , i . e . , an electrotonic spread from smooth muscle to the lining EC ( 18 – 20 ) . VIII . FUNCTIONAL ROLE OF ION CHANNELS IN ENDOTHELIUM A . Ion Channels and Electrogenesis in EC The membrane potential of vascular endothelial cells is negative compared with the blood and tissue compart - ment . Its value , as well as that of cell capacitance and input resistance , varies considerably between different cells types and conditions of cell isolation and culturing . Resting membrane potentials between 0 and 2 80 mV , membrane capacitances between 30 and 80 pF , and input resistances between 1 and 10 G V have been reported for isolated , nonconﬂuent EC . Conﬂuent cells have a higher membrane capacitance ( up to 160 pF ) and a lower input resistance 0 . 01 – 0 . 4 G V . Although these latter values are uncertain , they are consistent with the existence of inter - cellular electrical coupling via gap junctions . The mem - brane potential also depends on the EC type and is in general more negative in macrovascular than in microvas - cular EC ( 63 , 295 , 449 , 462 ) . The main determinant of the resting potential in most cell types is a basal K 1 conductance . However , the ex - pression of K 1 channels varies greatly between different EC types and even within the same strain of cultured EC . For example , inwardly rectifying K 1 channels ( IRK ) are functional in some macrovascular EC ( 137 , 138 , 180 , 290 , 295 ) but seem to be preferentially expressed in cultured cells and absent in freshly isolated cells ( 349 , 381 ) . They have also been reported to be either present ( 427 ) or absent in freshly isolated coronary microvascular EC ( 72 ) . This heterogeneous expression may contribute to the highly variable resting potential of EC . The resting membrane potential in several endothe - lial cell types has a bimodal distribution , consisting of cells with a resting potential between 2 70 and 2 60 mV that is mainly controlled by IRK ( K 1 - type EC ) and cells in which the Cl 2 conductance is dominating ( Cl 2 - type EC ) with a resting potential between 2 40 and 2 10 mV . The latter values are close to E Cl , suggesting that a Cl 2 con - ductance is activated under resting conditions . This con - ductance , which is suppressed by cell shrinkage , appar - ently represents basal activity of swelling - induced Cl 2 channels , as described above . This bimodal distribution may be explained by the N - shaped current - voltage rela - tionship observed in these cells ( 274 , 419 ) . In addition , the hyperpolarization induced by decreased extracellular Na 1 is consistent with a contribution of either a Na 1 - selective or a nonselective cation conductance to the resting permeability . The relative contributions of the Na 1 , K 1 , and Cl 2 conductance to the resting potential range from 3 to 30 % , 27 to 95 % , and 9 to 35 % ( 138 , 240 , 295 , 407 , 419 ) . Figure 11 gives an example for the electrogen - esis of the membrane potential in a “resting , ” nonstimu - lated macrovascular BPAEC . The hyperpolarization , induced by vasoactive stimuli , such as acetylcholine , bradykinin , and histamine , in cells that do not express inwardly rectifying K 1 channels is mediated by the activation of Ca 2 1 - dependent K 1 cur - rents and is often followed by a sustained depolarization due to activation of NSC ( 63 , 177 , 179 , 225 , 239 , 250 , 274 ) . Figure 12 shows an example of stimulation - dependent changes in membrane potential that are a mirror image of the concomitant changes in [ Ca 2 1 ] i . The electrogenic Na 1 - K 1 - ATPase contributes approximately 2 8 mV to the resting potential of EC ( 63 , 303 , 370 ) . Although a NCX has FIG . 11 . Electrogenesis in a nonstimulated ( resting ) BPAEC . Current - voltage relationships from linear volt - age ramps ( from 2 150 to 1 100 mV ) under control con - ditions ( 1 ) , in the presence of 1 mM Ba 2 1 to inhibit IRK ( 2 ) , and after shrinking the cell in the presence of Ba 2 1 by adding of 100 mM mannitol to inhibit VRAC ( 3 ; see text ) . The remaining current represents a nonselective cation current ( for detailed discussion see Ref . 416 ) . The difference current ( 1 – 2 ) is an inwardly rectifying K 1 current ( IRK ) through the recently identiﬁed channel Kir 2 . 1 ( 95 , 179 ) . The VRAC Cl 2 current ( 276 , 416 ) is recon - structed from the difference current ( 2 – 3 ) . The resting membrane potential reﬂects the respective contributions of these three conductances . Membrane potentials in this cell type show a bimodal distribution with a peak at 2 80 mV and another around 2 25 mV ( 416 ) . Mibefradil ( 10 m M ) induces a fast and reversible block of VRAC . Therefore , the K 1 conductance becomes dominant and the membrane hyperpolarizes ( 281 ) . [ Modiﬁed from Voets et al . ( 419 ) . ] 1440 BERND NILIUS AND GUY DROOGMANS Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m been identiﬁed in EC ( 75 , 385 ) , no evidence for its elec - trogenic contribution to the membrane potential has been presented so far . B . Ca 2 1 Signaling in EC Various extracellular signals involved in the regu - lation of many of the described EC responses via spe - ciﬁc second messengers are integrated at the EC sur - face . Between these second messengers , cytosolic Ca 2 1 is one of the most important signals , which is very well conserved throughout the phylogenetic tree ( 318 ) . Reg - ulation of intracellular Ca 2 1 signals is probably the most important functional task of ion channels in EC . We will thus ﬁrst describe the phenomenology of Ca 2 1 signals in EC before discussing in detail the role of ion channels for Ca 2 1 entry and regulation of the inwardly driving force for Ca 2 1 . 1 . Ca 2 1 pattern , waves , and release sites Two phenotypes of Ca 2 1 signals can be distin - guished , i . e . , [ Ca 2 1 ] i oscillations or a biphasic increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i , consisting of a fast peak followed by a long - lasting plateau ( see Figs . 1 and 12 and Refs . 161 , 162 , 272 , 295 , 296 ) . Low concentrations of various agonists , such as acetylcholine , ATP , histamine , and bradykinin , often in - duce oscillations of [ Ca 2 1 ] i . These oscillations appear only in a small window of agonist concentrations ( 162 , 304 ) , whereas a biphasic rise in [ Ca 2 1 ] i prevails at higher concentrations ( 144 , 271 , 272 , 291 , 295 , 296 ) . The fast transient Ca 2 1 peak represents release of Ca 2 1 from InsP 3 - sensitive intracellular Ca 2 1 stores , whereas Ca 2 1 inﬂux from the extracellular space activated by store depletion accounts for the plateaulike phase . Plasma - lemmal ion channels provide an inﬂux route for Ca 2 1 and tune the inwardly driving force for Ca 2 1 inﬂux ( 271 , 272 , 295 , 318 ) . The sustained plateau level can be further mod - ulated at a constant driving force for Ca 2 1 by mitochon - drial Ca 2 1 buffering , Na 1 / Ca 2 1 exchange , PMCA , and SERCA ( predominantly SERCA - 3 ; Refs . 222 , 262 ) . Application of vasoactive agonists can also induce Ca 2 1 waves that travel through the cell at a speed of 5 – 60 m m / s depending on the agonist concentration and cellular region ( 151 , 255 ) . Ca 2 1 waves are regenerative , often arise at peripheral cytoplasmic processes , and propagate from the cell in which they originate to neighboring cells in the cell cluster without decrement of amplitude , kinetics , and speed of propagation ( 74 , 151 ) . These waves spread through gap junctions , mainly consisting of Cx40 and - 43 ( 221 ) . Regenerative propagation depends on PLC and likely also on the presence of calcium - induced calcium release ( CICR ) . Extracellular Ca 2 1 is required , which points to a role of Ca 2 1 entry channels in wave propaga - tion ( 74 ) . Activation of a Ca 2 1 transient and wave is preceded by small highly localized increases in [ Ca 2 1 ] i that originate from clusters of elementary Ca 2 1 release events ( blips ) . The amplitude of these blips of ; 23 nM corresponds to a Ca 2 1 current of 0 . 3 pA and is consistent with a current through a single or a small number of InsP 3 - sensitive release channels ( 151 ) . The expression pattern of SERCA and inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate recep - tor ( InsP 3 R ) isoforms in the endothelial endoplasmic reticulum varies between different cell types . Most EC express only SERCA - 3 . During cell differentiation , the expression of InsP 3 R - 1 decreases , whereas that of InsP 3 R - 3 increases ( 262 ) . Isshiki et al . ( 160 ) reported that the initial rise in [ Ca 2 1 ] i and Ca 2 1 wave in EC stimulated with agonists originate at peripheral loci enriched in caveolin , suggesting that caveolae may be involved in the initiation of Ca 2 1 waves . In addition , Ca 2 1 stores in EC might also be compartmentalized , since Ca 2 1 signals during submaximal stimulation were restricted to a subplasmalem - mal region , which probably reﬂects functional units consist - FIG . 12 . Changes in membrane potential and [ Ca 2 1 ] i by stimulating umbilical vein - derived endothelial cells with the P 2U agonists UTP and ATP .

These restricted Ca 2 1 signals in - duce local subplasmalemmal Ca 2 1 gradients . According to Graier et al . ( 118 ) , release from ryanodine - sensitive Ca 2 1 stores contributes to these local gradients . The most important release sites in EC are Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - sensitive Ca 2 1 stores , and the release channel is most likely InsP 3 R - 3 ( 262 ) . Other release sites , clearly distinct from mitochondria and from stores sensitive to ryanodine or Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , seem to respond to mechanical forces , such as stretch and shear stress ( 167 ) . The intra - cellular messenger responsible for this mechanosensitive release may be an arachidonic derivative ( 305 ) . The phar - macological properties of the ryanodine receptors medi - ating CICR in EC ( 213 , 432 ) are clearly different from the CICR mechanism in other cell types . Ruthenium red in - hibits and caffeine induces only a small release . The ryanodine - induced Ca 2 1 release is also different from the ruthenium red - blocked release , suggesting the existence of a ruthenium red - sensitive but ryanodine - insensitive CICR mechanism . CICR may operate to amplify the mag - nitude of the Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 response ( 313 , 315 , 350 , 432 , 454 ) . A mitochondrial CICR mechanism , insensitive to ryanodine and caffeine and blocked by cyclosporin A , an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore , has been described recently ( 440 ) . Equally important for Ca 2 1 signaling is the reﬁlling of Ca 2 1 stores . It probably occurs via the SERCA - 3 isoform of the endoplasmic Ca 2 1 - ATPase , which is abundantly expressed in EC . Because the acetylcholine - induced en - dothelium - dependent relaxation of aorta precontracted with phenylephrine was attenuated in SERCA - 3 - deﬁcient mouse , it has been concluded that SERCA - 3 plays a role in EC Ca 2 1 signaling involved in NO - mediated relaxation of vascular smooth muscle ( 222 ) . 2 . Ca 2 1 oscillations EC exhibit oscillations in [ Ca 2 1 ] i if stimulated with low agonist concentrations in a narrow concentration window ( see Fig . 12 and Refs . 162 , 272 , 295 , 296 , 304 ) . Synchroniza - tion of these Ca 2 1 oscillations in conﬂuent EC depends on cell - cell coupling ( 268 ) . These oscillations are frequently accompanied by oscillatory changes in membrane potential due to activation of BK Ca channels ( 272 , 295 , 296 , 314 , 415 ) . These oscillations are mainly due to periodic discharges of intracellular Ca 2 1 stores , since they are sustained for a long time in cells exposed to Ca 2 1 - free media ( 162 , 272 ) and apparently not via activation of a Ca 2 1 - inﬂux pathway since they are not affected by changes in the driving force for Ca 2 1 ( 272 ) . It is therefore likely that low agonist concentrations do not activate Ca 2 1 entry channels and that these channels are not involved in Ca 2 1 oscillations . However , [ Ca 2 1 ] i os - cillations in EA . hy926 cells seem to depend on Na 1 loading via NSC and Ca 2 1 entry via the endothelial NCX , a mecha - nism that also depends on membrane hyperpolarization via activation of BK Ca channels ( 314 ) . However , in the same cell type , similar Ca 2 1 oscillations were observed in voltage - clamped cells ( 272 ) . Activation of Ca 2 1 entry channels at higher agonist concentrations is important for reﬁlling of depleted intracellular stores . Activation of PKC , PLC block - ers , and inhibitors of SERCA pumps strongly suppress Ca 2 1 oscillations ( 49 , 272 ) . Under pathological conditions , glu - cose overload and superoxide anions also impair Ca 2 1 re - lease and Ca 2 1 oscillations ( 191 ) . 3 . Structural organization of Ca 2 1 signaling in endothelium : a role for caveolae ? Caveolae , abundantly present in EC , are specialized plasmalemmal microdomains enriched in glycosphingo - lipids , cholesterol , sphingolipds , and lipid - anchored mem - brane proteins ( 321 ) . They are omega - shaped invagina - tions with a diameter of 50 – 100 nm . Caveolae originate from “lipid raft domains” ( LRD ) in which sphingolipids and cholesterol are highly accumulated . Speciﬁc proteins attach to these LRD ( 101 – 103 , 130 ) . The major protein component of endothelial caveolar structures is caveo - lin - 1 ( CAV - 1 ) . It consists of 178 amino acid residues and has a molecular mass of 22 kDa . A Tyr residue at position 14 provides a target for protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) . The stretch of residues 81 – 101 is the scaffolding region ( CSD ) , which binds and “deactivates” several other pro - teins . Membrane insertion of CAV - 1 occurs via interaction with the hydrophobic hairpin ( residue 102 – 134 ) . Caveolar structures contain a variety of signal transduction mole - cules , including GPCRs , G proteins , and adenylyl cyclase , molecules involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca 2 1 homeostasis , such as the plasma membrane Ca 2 1 - ATPase and InsP 3 R - 3 ( 361 ) , eNOS , multiple components of the tyrosine kinase mitogen - activated protein kinase path - way , Ca 2 1 - sensitive activated PKC - a , and numerous lipid signaling molecules ( 3 , 371 ) . Various membrane recep - tors , such as the BK 2 receptor and the muscarinic m 2 - AchR , are targeted to caveolae upon agonist binding ( 21 , 89 ) . Vesicular transport systems in EC are in close contact with caveolae , which contain key proteins that mediate different aspects of exo - and endocytotic vesicle forma - tion , docking , and / or fusion , including the vSNARE VAMP - 2 , monomeric and trimeric GTPases , annexins II and VI , and the NEM - sensitive fusion factor NSF with its attachment protein SNAP . VAMP is also sensitive to cleav - age by botulinum B and tetanus neurotoxins . Caveolae in endothelium may therefore be considered as complex signaling and transport units ( 246 , 360 ) . Mechanostimulation by shear stress induces rapid ty - rosine phosphorylation of proteins located in caveolae , e . g . , ERK activation ( 320 , 345 ) . Tyrosine phosphorylation inﬂu - ences Ca 2 1 entry ( 94 ) and is necessary for gating of VRAC 1442 BERND NILIUS AND GUY DROOGMANS Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m channels , which are probably associated with CAV - 1 ( 391 ) . Ca 2 1 waves are triggered from caveolin - rich edges of EC ( 160 ) , and Ca 2 1 entry pathways are probably colocalized with caveolar sites in EC ( 210 ) . Recently , TRP1 has been identiﬁed in caveolae and LRD in human submandibular glands and found to be associated with CAV - 1 , G a q / 11 pro - teins , and the InsP 3 receptor type 3 ( InsP 3 R 3 ) . The scaffold - ing domain of CAV - 1 probably binds to NH 2 - and COOH - terminal sites of TRP1 ( 224 ) . An NH 2 - terminal site downstream of the InsP 3 binding site of the InsP3R associ - ates with several COOH - terminal sites of TRP3 ( 37 ) . An NCX protein has been detected in caveolin - rich membrane fractions containing both eNOS and CAV - 1 . It is interesting to speculate that also transmembrane Na 1 gradients may be involved in regulation of eNOS activity . This would provide a tight functional interaction between endothelial NCX and eNOS ( 385 ) . A complex of Ca 2 1 entry channels ( STRPCs ) , channels regulating the driving force for Ca 2 1 entry ( e . g . , VRAC ) connected with Ca 2 1 release sites ( InsP 3 R ) , the responding elements for ago - nist stimulation ( GPCR and G proteins ) and NCX in a close vicinity to caveolin - bound eNOS would provide a powerful signaling unit in EC ( Fig . 13 ) .

Caveolae are formed from “lipid raft do - mains . ” It is depicted that possibly a func - tional unit comprising receptors for the agonist response ( GPRC ) , Ca 2 1 entry channels ( TRPs ) , channels for regulating the driving force for Ca 2 1 and being in - volved in electrogenesis ( e . g . , the volume - regulated anion channel , VRAC ) and pos - sible also the Na 1 / Ca 2 1 exchanger ( NCX ) are components of such units ( for a dis - cussion see text ) . Probably TRPs could be coupled to the InsP 3 receptor ( InsP 3 R ) in subplasmalemmal store . Coupling domain has been identiﬁed in the NH 2 terminus of the InsP 3 R downstream of the InsP 3 bind - ing site and the COOH terminus of TRPs . TRPs might couple to caveolin - 1 ( cav - 1 ) as well as VRAC and GPRC ( for discussion see text ) .

ION CHANNELS IN VASCULAR ENDOTHELIUM 1443 Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m sis , 4 ) EC growth and remodeling of the vessel wall , and 5 ) mediate inﬂammation . Table 3 gives an overview of various factors released from EC . It is generally agreed that synthesis and / or release of vasoactive compounds depends on or can be modulated by changes in [ Ca 2 1 ] i ( 41 , 50 , 154 , 273 , 295 ) . Sources for an increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i are primarily release of Ca 2 1 from intracellular stores via an Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - dependent mecha - nism and inﬂux of extracellular Ca 2 1 . Ion channels play a role in the latter process by either providing an inﬂux pathway for extracellular Ca 2 1 or by regulating the driv - ing force for this inﬂux . We ﬁrst discuss some EC func - tions in which Ca 2 1 plays a regulatory role . The release of NO is involved in the control of relax - ation of vascular SMC , but also inhibits platelet aggrega - tion , proliferation of SMC ( an anti - atherosclerotic func - tion ) , the migration of monocytes and leukocytes , and the expression of adhesion molecules . NO produced by eNOS is a fundamental determinant of cardiovascular ho - meostasis and regulates systemic blood pressure , vascu - lar remodeling , and angiogenesis . The most important physiological stimulus for the continuous formation of NO is viscous drag ( shear stress ) exerted by streaming blood on the endothelial layer . This basal release seems to be Ca 2 1 independent . The serine / threonine protein kinase Akt / PKB mediates the activation of eNOS , leading to in - creased NO production and might be the target of shear stress probably involving a sensor function of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( PECAM - 1 or CD31 , 71 ) . NO can also be released via activation of a Ca 2 1 / CaM - dependent pathway which requires sustained inﬂux of extracellular Ca 2 1 ( 116 , 157 , 210 ) . In EC , eNOS is local - ized in signal - transducing domains of the plasmalemma , the so - called caveolae ( 321 ) . Acetylation of eNOS by myr - istic and palmitoyl acid enables targeting of the enzyme to the caveolae . Under resting conditions , eNOS is inacti - vated due to its binding to the caveolar scaffolding protein CAV - 1 . An increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i promotes binding of cal - modulin to eNOS and its dissociation from caveolin . A more prolonged exposure to increased levels of [ Ca 2 1 ] i redistributes eNOS to the cytosol and is accompanied by depalmitoylation and phosphorylation ( for reviews , see Refs . 90 , 252 , 253 , 336 ) . Lin et al . ( 219 ) showed in a recent elegant study that NO production is mainly controlled by myristoylated , membrane - associated eNOS that senses CCE , and that it is less sensitive to intracellular Ca 2 1 release . The rapid synthesis and release of the anticoagulant prostacyclin ( PGI 2 ) requires a rise in [ Ca 2 1 ] i and phos - phorylation of PLA 2 ( 323 ) . PGI 2 is released “on demand” . An increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i translocates cytosolic PLA 2 from the cytosol to phospholipid membranes , especially to the nuclear membrane and the plasmalemma . PLA 2 is sup - posed to be colocalized in these regions with cyclooxy - genase and lipoxygenase , which are necessary to convert arachidonic acid to vasoactive compounds , such as PGI 2 and EET products . This translocation occurs via a Ca 2 1 - dependent phospholipid - binding domain at the NH 2 ter - minus of PLA 2 ( CaLB ; Refs . 59 , 97 ) . An additional phos - phorylation of cPLA 2 is required for the synthesis of PGI 2 . This phosphorylation is mediated by a p42 / p44 MAP ki - nase , which is activated by PKC and probably also by an increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i . Stimulation of PGI 2 synthesis by va - soactive compounds ( ACh , bradykinin , and ATP ) is sup - ported by Ca 2 1 inﬂux via Ca 2 1 entry channels , including SOC ( 115 , 181 , 261 ) . PGI 2 supports the vasodilating action of NO and is also produced in response to shear stress . PAF is also produced on demand . Its synthesis is triggered by an increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i which precedes acti - vation of PLA 2 . Importantly , released PAF also binds to EC and mediates Ca 2 1 inﬂux into its generator cells ( 200 ) . Another factor that is synthesized and released in a Ca 2 1 - dependent way is the EDHF , which might be 5 , 6 - EET . Another recent hypothesis suggests that EDHF , or at least one of its components , is K 1 released from EC by activation of BK Ca channels into the space between EC and smooth muscle cells ( 82 ) . This effect would also require a sustained elevation of [ Ca 2 1 ] i in EC . TABLE 3 .

The best - studied example is the vWF , a large polymeric protein that binds coagulation factor VIII and protects it from cleavage , and which also contains binding sites for the platelet glycoproteins GPIb and GPIIb / IIIa to collagen , heparin , and vitronectin . It is stored in secretory granules , Weibel - Palade bodies , which are large vesicular organelles of ; 200 nm in diameter and up to 4 , 000 nm in length . vWF is released by CaM - dependent exocytosis triggered by an increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i ( 28 ) . Weibel - Palade bodies also contain the leukocyte adhesion protein P - selectin ( GMP - 140 ) , which appears at the cell surface as a result of exocytosis ( 428 ) . tPA , which activates ﬁbrinolysis and thrombolysis in blood vessels , is another example of a stored anticoagu - lant molecule that is released in a Ca 2 1 - dependent way . The mechanisms involved in the secretion of vWF and tPA differ considerably . Thrombin stimulation of EC induces tPA secretion from small vesicles morphologically differ - ent from the larger Weibel - Palade bodies and from caveo - lae ( 85 ) . Release of tPA from EC is regulated by hista - mine , which like thrombin elevates [ Ca 2 1 ] i , but also by endothelins and cytokines . In addition , tPA is constitu - tively released . TFPI is an important antithrombotic factor that in - hibits complex “tissue factor ( TF ) VIIa , ” which in turn activates factors IXa and Xa and starts coagulation . TFPI - 1 , a 36 - kDa glycoprotein , is a Kunitz - type serine protease inhibitor with an obvious role in the prevention of thrombosis . TFPI is released upon heparin administra - tion . The heparin - binding site of TFPI ( HBS - 1 ) is located in its COOH - terminal basic portion . This Kunitz - type serine proteinase inhibitor contains three tandem KPI domains . TFPI - 2 is another heparin - releasable 33 - kDa serine - protease inhibitor . TFPIs are located in well - de - ﬁned granules evenly spread over the cell surface and in the apical part of the cytoplasm . These granules are dis - tinct from Weibel - Palade bodies and have a smaller diam - eter of ; 200 nm . TFPI colocalizes in EC with caveolin . It is bound by a speciﬁc glycosylphosphatidylinositol - an - chorage mechanism that depends on the presence of cho - lesterol ( 229 , 230 ) . TPFI containing vesicles might be docked on caveolae and can therefore be rapidly translo - cated to the exocytotic machinery ( 360 ) . TFPI binds in a Ca 2 1 - independent way to a phosphatidylserine phospho - lipid surface depending on the presence of the TFPI COOH - terminal Kunitz domain . The interaction of TFPI with phosphatidylserine is decreased when [ Ca 2 1 ] i is in - creased , a mechanism important for TFPI release ( 402 ) . PAI - 1 , an inhibitor of ﬁbrinolysis , is also released in a Ca 2 1 - dependent manner . However , the increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i induces only a modest increase of PAI - 1 but suppresses the action of much stronger release stimuli , such as TNF - a ( 324 ) . The release of PAI - 1 is regulated by physi - ological factors that elevate [ Ca 2 1 ] i , such as thrombin and histamine , but also by endothelins and cytokines . The regulation of tPA release and that of PAI - 1 release are not necessarily coupled , and the exact role of [ Ca 2 1 ] i has to be elucidated ( 324 , 446 ) . Another stored factor in the regulation of coagulation is protein S , a vitamin K - dependent nonenzymatic coagu - lation factor involved in the regulation of activated pro - tein C that has a strong anticoagulant function . An in - crease in [ Ca 2 1 ] i releases protein S from cell organelles with a diameter of 0 . 1 m m ( 375 ) . Vasoconstrictor responses of EC are mainly medi - ated by the release of ET - 1 , which is produced during stimulating of EC with thrombin , transforming growth factor - b ( TGF - b ) , interleukin - 1 , angiotensin II , and argi - nine vasopressin . It acts via ET A receptors on subendo - thelial vascular SMC , but it can also act on ET B receptors on EC and provide a negative feedback by stimulating NO release . ET - 1 and its precursor big ET - 1 are colocalized in granules with a diameter of ; 0 . 1 m m , suggesting that they are not only release sites but also important subcellular compartments for ET processing ( 131 ) . Small amounts of ET - 3 increase NO release ( 436 ) . Ca 2 1 is involved in this regulation probably via activation of PKC and an Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - mediated increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i . Both ET - 1 and ET - 3 mobilize stored Ca 2 1 and activate Ca 2 1 entry path - ways ( 4 ) . The release of ETs is , however , not transient but persistent , and the relationship between [ Ca 2 1 ] i and ET release seems to be contradictory , since thrombin in - creases but bradykinin decreases ET release although both elevate [ Ca 2 1 ] i ( 120 ) . The role of Ca 2 1 for ET release remains unclear . All substances stored in granules are released by regulated exocytosis , e . g . , vWF , tPA , TFPI , protein S , and ET - 1 and ET - 3 . Exocytosis , probably except for the re - lease of ET - 1 , depends on an increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i . Vesicular secretion of vasoactive mediators has been assessed from changes in membrane capacitance . Intracellular Ca 2 1 in - creases induced by ﬂash photolysis of caged Ca 2 1 or Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 exert a biphasic effect on membrane capaci - tance , consisting of an initial transient increase followed by a much larger delayed component and which both depend on [ Ca 2 1 ] i ( 51 ) . Probably , the late and large changes in membrane capacitance reﬂect the exocytotic release of vWF , whereas the faster events might be re - lated to tPA and TFPI release . NO release and vWF re - lease clearly depend on the presence of extracellular Ca 2 1 , indicating that Ca 2 1 inﬂux is necessary to support this EC function ( 51 ) , whereas prostacyclin , tPA , and TFPI depend to a larger extent on release of intracellular Ca 2 1 ( 50 ) . In summary , several EC functions including the production of vasoactive compounds on demand and the release of stored compounds by exocytosis depend on an increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i . Two sources of Ca 2 1 are involved : an Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - mediated Ca 2 1 release from intracellular ION CHANNELS IN VASCULAR ENDOTHELIUM 1445 Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m stores , which in a long term must be replenished from extracellular sources , and Ca 2 1 entry from the extracel - lular side . Although not many details are known about the mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in endothelium , it is obvious that ion channels play an important role in these processes by modulating the changes in [ Ca 2 1 ] i . D . Ion Channels and Control of Vessel Permeation , Leukocyte Migration , and Cell - Cell Contacts A major activity of EC is the regulation of exchange of solutes , proteins , and endocytosed particles between blood and tissue . Part of this transport is mediated by changes in the paracellular permeability of the endothe - lial layer . An increase in endothelial [ Ca 2 1 ] i enhances the permeability of microvessels , which is abolished in Ca 2 1 - free solution , but also when the cells are depolarized . Agonists like thrombin or histamine , which all transiently increase [ Ca 2 1 ] i , will therefore induce a short increase in vascular permeability , whereas others , such as cytokines and growth factors , induce a more sustained change . This increase in permeability is due to changes in the cytoskel - eton , cellular contraction , and cell - cell coupling ( 68 ) , pro - cesses that are all controlled by myosin light - chain phos - phorylation . EC contraction and regulation of hydraulic permeability depend on inﬂux of Ca 2 1 ( 174 ) and involve a Ca 2 1 / CaM - dependent nonmuscle MLCK isoform that has recently been cloned in human endothelium ( see below and Refs . 412 , 413 ) . The regulation of permeability in macrovessels is more complex . An ionomycin - induced increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i enhances the permeability of porcine aorta endothelium , whereas a comparable increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i by ATP reduces its permeability . This increase is attenuated by the PLC inhibitor U - 73122 ( 299 ) . Shrinkage of EC increases microvessel permeability if perfused with the Gly - Arg - Gly Asp - Thr - Pro ( GRGDTP ) peptide to disrupt integrin - dependent attachment of EC to the extracellular matrix ( 174 , 175 ) . In general , spreading of EC on their matrix and contact formation with their basement membrane has a selective requirement for Ca 2 1 inﬂux ( 2 ) . [ Ca 2 1 ] i and cAMP are two interactive signals that control vessel permeability . Increased [ Ca 2 1 ] i promotes disruption of the macrovascular EC barrier but not the microvascular barrier . Increased cAMP enhances endo - thelial barrier function . During inﬂammation , elevated [ Ca 2 1 ] i decreases cAMP to increase intercellular perme - ability ( 260 ) . Changes in [ Ca 2 1 ] i that regulate the perme - ability of the EC barrier possibly require activation of store - operated Ca 2 1 entry channels ( 259 ) . We have shown ( see sect . IV C1 ) that the VRAC regu - lates cell volume and provides a pathway for organic osmolytes and amino acids . Interestingly , its gating in - volves activation of RhoA ( 288 , 298 ) . Because inactivation of RhoA also enhances the endothelial barrier function due to enhanced myosin ribbon and stress ﬁber - focal adhesion formation ( 47 ) , VRAC may also be involved in the control of endothelial barrier function . Also , the con - trol of EC permeability via MLCK is tightly coupled to CCE - mediated Ca 2 1 entry ( 300 ) . EC permeability and neutrophilic leukocyte diapede - sis through paracellular gaps are cardinal features of acute inﬂammation , which are mediated by myosin light - chain phosphorylation . This phosphorylation results from a Ca 2 1 / CaM - dependent activation of an EC - speciﬁc , 214 - kDa , nonmuscle MLCK distinct from the smooth muscle MLCK isoforms ( 130 – 150 kDa ) ( 106 ) . This EC MLCK iso - form binds biotinylated CaM in a Ca 2 1 - dependent manner and colocalizes with myosin , actin , and CaM . Thus MLCK in EC is a further target for changes in [ Ca 2 1 ] i . Inhibition of MLCK activity by activating cAMP - PKA reduced leuko - cyte transmigration . The myosin - associated phosphatase inhibitor calyculin induces accumulation of phosphory - lated myosin light chains , EC contraction , and signiﬁ - cantly enhances leukocyte migration . Ca 2 1 - dependent EC MLCK is therefore a key determinant of vascular per - meability and transendothelial leukocyte migration ( 107 , 412 , 413 ) . E . Ion Channels : A Role in EC Growth and Angiogenesis ? Extracellular angiogenesis inducers ( VEGF , basic ﬁ - broblast growth factor , acidic ﬁbroblast growth factor , PDGF , IL - 8 , PAF , etc . ) that stimulate proliferation and migration of EC regulate the formation of new blood vessels ( angiogenesis ) . Angiogenesis inhibitors , such as tumor suppressor genes , angiostatin , and endostatin , counteract these processes ( for a review , see Refs . 43 , 48 ) . Surprisingly , blockers of VRAC , such as tamoxifen , clomiphene , b - estradiol , NPPB , IAA - 94 , DIDS , quinine , quinidine , mibefradil , and ﬂufenamic acid , also suppress the growth of EC ( 238 , 278 , 283 , 425 ) . It is well known that ion channels modulate the progression through the cell cycle . Block of K 1 channels and cell depolarization in - duce G 1 arrest in several cells types ( 275 ) . The cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitors p27 ( Kip1 ) and p21 ( CIP1 ) might be involved in this mechanism ( 112 ) . In addition , angiogenesis is inhibited by various blockers of VRAC with unrelated chemical structure , such as NPPB , mibe - fradil , and the antiestrogens tamoxifen and clomiphene , as assessed in four assays of angiogenesis : the Matrigel and ﬁbrin gel assays of tube formation by endothelial cells in vitro , the rat aorta - ring assay of spontaneous microves - sel formation ex vivo , and the chick chorioallantoic mem - brane assay of neovascularization in vivo . These results suggest that anion channels may play a role in angiogen - 1446 BERND NILIUS AND GUY DROOGMANS Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m esis and have a potential therapeutic action in tumor growth and other angiogenesis - dependent pathophysio - logical processes ( 238 ) . The mechanism of action is un - known , but it may be linked to the role of VRAC in volume and pH regulation or ﬁne - tuning the driving force for Ca 2 1 entry , which is important at the Ca 2 1 - dependent cell cycle control point , i . e . , between G 1 and S . It has also been shown that the functional expression of VRAC changes when cells switch from proliferation to differentiation , further supporting a role of ion channels in the regulation of cell growth ( 237 , 278 , 295 , 426 ) . Recently , clear evidence has been presented for a role of Ca 2 1 in the regulation of angiogenesis in vivo . VEGF - A , a member of the family of endothelial growth factors ( VEGFs ) , plays a dominant role in the regulation of angiogenesis and vascular permeability ( 91 ) . The en - dothelial vascular growth factor receptor , VEGFR - 2 , binds VEGF - A and VEGF - E and activates a signaling cas - cade involving autophosphorylation , activation of PLC - g and elevation of [ Ca 2 1 ] i , and a VEGF - dependent Ca 2 1 inﬂux ( 135 , 341 , 430 ) . Activation of VEGFR - 2 induces store depletion and triggers activation of CCE ( CRAC ) channels , resulting in Ca 2 1 inﬂux that might be important for the control of angiogenesis . This example clearly dem - onstrates that ion channels are involved in a complex phenomenon like angiogenesis . Furthermore , CAI , a blocker of ligand - stimulated Ca 2 1 inﬂux , inhibits EC pro - liferation , adhesion , and invasion into the basement mem - brane of EC . Likely , Ca 2 1 - regulated events are important in native and FGF 2 - stimulated EC proliferation and inva - sion , perhaps through regulation of FGF 2 - induced phos - phorylation events ( 197 ) . F . Role of Ion Channels in Dysfunction of Endothelium ? Several disorders , among which hypertension , arte - riosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases , diabetes , and hypercholesterolemia , are associated with a dysfunc - tional endothelium ( 33 ) . Endothelial - dependent relax - ation is impaired in essential hypertension because of a deﬁcient release of NO . Release of ET - 1 exacerbates hy - pertension . Obviously , defective Ca 2 1 signaling can be the cause of this deﬁcient NO production . CCE is signiﬁcantly reduced in aorta EC of trp4 - deﬁcient mice , and the NO - mediated vasorelaxation of aortic rings is impaired ( 99 ) , indicating that a sustained inﬂux of Ca 2 1 is important for endothelial NO production . It is well known that BK Ca channels modulate NO production ( 256 ) , indicating that channels that control the driving force for Ca 2 1 entry are also essential for the control of NO synthesis . Changes in membrane potential per se also induce signiﬁcant changes in NO - mediated EC responses . An intriguing example is the depolarization - induced superox - ide formation in HUVEC ( 374 ) . Superoxide anions not only impair NO - mediated responses but are also involved in the development of hypertensive vascular hypertrophy . EC depolarization also enhanced tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of as yet unidentiﬁed membrane proteins and in - duced membrane association of the small G protein Rac . Cation and anion channels are the main candidates for inducing depolarization and are therefore probably in - volved in this important pathogenic mechanism . Hypoxic and ischemic conditions also mediate EC - dependent vasoconstriction by release of arachidonic acid , PGH 2 , thromboxane A 2 , and endoperoxides . The enhanced NO production under these conditions in - creases the amount of NO - derived peroxydenitrite ( ONOO 2 ) , which becomes peroxinitrous acid and forms hydroxyl ions . These vasoconstrictor superoxide anions are highly reactive , damage the cell membrane , and ﬁnally reduce NO production ( 32 ) . A possible mechanism for the hypoxia - induced autacoid release , which seems to de - pend on extracellular Ca 2 1 , could be an increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i ( 6 , 10 , 42 , 93 , 178 , 348 ) . It has been recently described that metabolic inhibition stimulates Ca 2 1 entry in EC probably via activation of TRP3 , a NSC that is a member of the STRPC subfamily ( see sect . III C and Ref . 380 ) . G . Concluding Remarks EC form a multifunctional signal - transducing surface that regulates many fundamental processes in the vascu - lar system , such as the control of blood ﬂow and blood pressure , coagulation , platelet aggregation , vessel perme - ability , wound healing , and angiogenesis . It is rather sur - prising that these cells express such a huge variety of ion channels . We are still in the very beginning of identifying these channels at the molecular level , although some of the main players , such as trp gene - encoded channels , are distinctly emerging . One obvious functional target of EC ion channels is Ca 2 1 signaling . It is ﬁrmly established that many EC functions depend on Ca 2 1 , but we do not un - derstand at all how this signal , an increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i , allows for speciﬁc EC responses on demand . The Ca 2 1 signal in EC is shaped by release of Ca 2 1 from intracel - lular pools , entry of Ca 2 1 via plasmalemmal channels , and the concerted action of several Ca 2 1 sequestration mech - anisms , such as activation of PMCA and SERCA Ca 2 1 pumps and probably NCX . However , several EC func - tions , e . g . , release of vasoactive compounds including NO , vWF , PAF , tPA , and TFPI , probably require activation of exocytosis and need a high and a long - lasting plateaulike increase in [ Ca 2 1 ] i that mainly depends on Ca 2 1 entry . The molecular nature of Ca 2 1 entry channels is not yet known . However , there is increasing evidence that SOC and nonselective Ca 2 1 - permeable channels are the main ION CHANNELS IN VASCULAR ENDOTHELIUM 1447 Physiol Rev • VOL 81 • OCTOBER 2001 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m players for this entry . Probably , members of the STRPC family are involved in functionally structuring this Ca 2 1 entry . We have also shown that it is mandatory for EC not only to activate Ca 2 1 entry channels upon various stimuli , but also to provide a sufﬁciently large inwardly driving force for Ca 2 1 . Among the channels that inﬂuence elec - trogenesis in EC are various types of K 1 channels . Espe - cially Ca 2 1 - activated K 1 channels , mainly belonging to the slo family , are important targets for regulating Ca 2 1 entry and Ca 2 1 - dependent EC functions . Surprisingly , Cl 2 channels are also abundantly present in EC . Among these channels , especially the VRAC might be multifunctional . This channel can counteract the depolarizing action of other channels and contribute to a stabilization of the inwardly driving force for Ca 2 1 . Interestingly , these chan - nels might be localized in the caveolar compartment to - gether with eNOS , signaling proteins , including receptors such as GPCRs , ATPases , small G proteins , kinases , the endo - and exocytotic machinery , and other ion channels , such as STRPCs , forming a complex that seems to play an important role in signal transduction in EC . Future work must focus on the functional role of these important cellular compartments . Obviously , ion channels are also important players in other EC functions . VRAC channels are involved in trans - port of organic molecules including amino acids , and various channels inﬂuence cell proliferation and angio - genesis as well as control EC permeation and cell - cell coupling . Another intriguing topic in EC biology is its role as a mechanosensor . Irrefutably , mechanosensing properties of EC are directly or indirectly coupled with ion channels , although clear mechanosensor channels are , after several preliminary candidates have been proposed , elusive . We discuss here the possibility that CCE channels are indi - rectly involved in mechanosensing and discuss channels with obvious mechanosensing properties , VRAC and in - wardly rectifying K 1 channels . We are obviously at the verge of understanding the role of ion channels in EC and to appreciate that these channels might be important targets for the pharmacolog - ical modulation of fundamental EC functions . Indeed , we are at the very beginning of considering EC ion channels as targets of novel therapeutic compounds to control Ca 2 1 entry and its driving force . In addition , ion channels might be the cause for EC dysfunction linked to human disorders . To catalyze a further understanding of EC physiology and pathophysiology , it is necessary to include also the expanding ﬁeld of ion channels expressed in EC in the general interest of vascular cell biologists .
