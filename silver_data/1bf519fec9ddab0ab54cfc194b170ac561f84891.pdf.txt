A review on the role of fatty acids in colorectal cancer progression Malvina Hoxha * and Bruno Zappacosta Department for Chemical - Toxicological and Pharmacological Evaluation of Drugs , Faculty of Pharmacy , Catholic University Our Lady of Good Counsel , Tirana , Albania Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is the third leading cause of mortality in cancer patients . The role of fatty acids ( FA ) and their metabolism in cancer , particularly in CRC raises a growing interest . In particular , dysregulation of synthesis , desaturation , elongation , and mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids are involved . Here we review the current evidence on the link between cancer , in particular CRC , and fatty acids metabolism , not only to provide insight on its pathogenesis , but also on the development of novel biomarkers and innovative pharmacological therapies that are based on FAs dependency of cancer cells . KEYWORDS cancer , colorectal cancer , fatty acid , PUFA , eicosanoid 1 Introduction In the early 1950s , Medes et al . , described the role of glucose carbon and acetate in the fatty acid synthesis in neoplastic tissues ( Medes et al . , 1953 ) . This study was the ﬁ rst to determine that lipogenesis occur in neoplastic tissues . Subsequently , numerous studies con ﬁ rmed the importance of fatty acid biosynthesis for cancer cell growth and survival . The regulation of lipid synthesis , the respective metabolism , as well as their uptake and degradation are essential for the maintenance of the cellular physiology ; hence the perturbation of these processes can impact the cancer development ( Snaebjornsson et al . , 2020 ) . During the last 15 years , the rewiring of cellular metabolism in cancer cells has been widely discussed ( Hanahan and Weinberg , 2011 ; La Vecchia and Sebastian , 2020 ) . Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is the third most common malignant neoplasm , with a high rate of mortality , and incidence , which is predicted to increase by 60 % in 2030 ( Ferlay et al . , 2013 ) . Wnt ( Thompson 2014 ) , KRas ( Pupo et al . , 2019 ) and p53 ( Labuschagne et al . , 2018 ) are among the CRC drivers and regulators of cancer metabolism . 2 The fatty acids ( FAs ) overview : From biochemistry to metabolism Fatty acids ( FAs ) are carboxylic acids that are involved in energy storage and are absorbed from food , or synthesized de novo , endogenously from acetyl CoA , which OPEN ACCESS EDITED BY Emanuela Ricciotti , UniversityofPennsylvania , UnitedStates REVIEWED BY Diwakar Bastihalli Tukaramrao , The Pennsylvania State University , United States Lucia Guadalupe Taja Chayeb , National Institute of Cancerology ( INCAN ) , Mexico * CORRESPONDENCE Malvina Hoxha , m . hoxha @ unizkm . al SPECIALTY SECTION This article was submitted to In ﬂ ammation Pharmacology , a section of the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology RECEIVED 31 August 2022 ACCEPTED 30 November 2022 PUBLISHED 12 December 2022 CITATION Hoxha M and Zappacosta B ( 2022 ) , A review on the role of fatty acids in colorectal cancer progression .

Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin . org 01 TYPE Review PUBLISHED 12 December 2022 DOI 10 . 3389 / fphar . 2022 . 1032806 involve the FAs uptake and esteri ﬁ cation into cell membranes as phospholipids ( Ratnayake and Galli , 2009 ; Currie et al . , 2013 ) . Esteri ﬁ ed FAs govern some of cell membrane physical properties , or can be released through phospholipase action . Besides , exogenous FAs can be stored as triglycerides and cholesterol esters ( Ferreri et al . , 2016 ) . Saturated fatty acids ( SFA ) contain nodouble bond . Other FAs that contain carbon double bonds with an even number of carbon atoms are termed unsaturated fatty acids . Monounsaturated fatty acids ( MUFAs ; i . e . palmitoleic acid , 16 : 1 ) are FAs that contain one double bond , while polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs , i . e . arachidonic acid , 20 : 4 ) contain more than one double bond . 2 . 1 De novo biosynthesis Tumor cells are characterized by both a high FAs supply , and upregulation of lipogenesis ( Tiwary et al . , 2019 ; Koundouros and Poulogiannis , 2020 ) . As shown in Figure 1 , de novo synthesis of FAs starts from acetyl - CoA originated from carbohydrate or protein metabolism , as well as from FA oxidation . Acetyl - CoA is catalyzed through FA synthase ( FASN ) in 16 : 0 PA ( palmitic acid ) , which is further elongated in 18 : 0 SA ( stearic acid ) . Δ 9 - Desaturase is responsible of the transformation of 16 : 0 PA into 16 : 1 ( palmitoleic acid ) , and 18 : 0 into 18 : 1 ( oleic acid ) ( Ratnayake and Galli , 2009 ) . Endogenous monounsaturated fatty acids ( MUFA ) are synthesized by stearoyl - CoA desaturases ( SCD ) and Δ 9 - desaturases from saturated fatty acids that are rate - limiting for MUFA synthesis ( Green et al . , 2010 ) . 2 . 2 Polyunsaturated and essential fatty acids Besides SFA and MUFAs biosynthesis , different families of PUFAs exist , such as omega - 3 ( ω - 3 ) PUFA , omega - 6 ( ω - 6 ) PUFAs , omega - 7 ( ω - 7 ) PUFA , omega - 9 ( ω - 9 ) PUFA ( Das , 2004 ) . Eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , docosapentaenoic acid ( DPA ) , α - linolenic acid ( ALA ) , and stearidonic acid ( SDA ) belong to the ω - 3 PUFAs ( Shahidi and Ambigaipalan , 2018 ) . Linoleic acid ( LA ) is part of the ω - 6 PUFAs . Palmitic acid and oleic acid belong to ω - 7 , and ω - 9 PUFAs respectively . ω - 7 and the ω - 9 PUFAs that derive from palmitoleic acid ( PA 16 : 1 ω - 7 ) and oleic acid ( OA 18 : 1 ω - 9 ) respectively , are synthesized in mammals , unlike essential fatty acids ( EFAs ) , ω - 3 PUFAs ( linolenic acid ( ALA 18 : 3 , ω - 3 ) ) , and ω - 6 PUFAs ( linoleic acid ( LA 18 : 2 ω - 6 ) ) that cannot be synthesized in humans ( Ratnayake and Galli , 2009 ) . The enzymes responsible of elongation and desaturation reactions of EFAs ( ω - 6 and ω - 3 PUFAs ) are located in the endoplasmic reticulum ( Grammatikos et al . , 1994 ) . Δ 6 - Desaturase is responsible of the elongation of stearidonic acid ( SDA , 18 : 4 ) in eicosatetraenoic acid ( ETA 20 : 4 ω - 3 ) ( Figure 2 ) , which is further desaturated by Δ 5 - desaturase giving rise to EPA 20 : 5 . In regard to the ω - 6 family , arachidonic acid ( AA 20 : 4 ) is produced from LA ( 18 : 2 ω - 6 ) , which is further desaturated to gamma - linolenic acid ( GLA 18 : 3 ) . In addition , because of the sharing of the same enzymes , the transformation of LA to AA ( ω - 6 family ) , is competitive with that of ALA to EPA ( ω - 3 family ) ( Grammatikos et al . , 1994 ) . 22 : 5 ω - 6 and 22 : 6 ω - 3 ( docosahexaenoic acid , DHA ) are produced from AA and EPA , following elongation and Δ 4 - desaturation respectively . Sprecher et al . reported that the biosynthesis of DHA occurs through two sequential elongations of AA and EPA , which is followed by Δ 6 - desaturation , and ß - oxidation in the peroxisome ( Sprecher et al . , 1995 ) . Interestingly , this pathway , which implies a signi ﬁ cant role of peroxisomes in the biosynthesis of the very long - chain PUFAs , has been proposed as an unconventional pathway ( Qiu 2003 ) . Since Δ 5 and Δ 6 - desaturases are slow in humans ( Δ 5 > Δ 6 ) , the supplementation of EPA and DHA to bypass Δ 5 and Δ 6 - desaturases is extensively recommended in subjects with an ω - 3 PUFAs de ﬁ cient Western Diet . In addition , in humans the DHA is low following supplementation with ALA or EPA , hence DHA supplementation is pivotal ( Richard and Calder , 2016 ) . 2 . 3 FA uptake In studies using membrane models , it has been reported that uncharged FAs enter into cells by passive diffusion ( ﬂ ip - ﬂ op ) ( Simard et al . , 2008 ) . Overwhelming evidence showed that in mammalian cells , the FAs uptake occurs by a wide variety of integral or membrane associated proteins . It has been recognized that most of the exogenous FAs are rapidly distributed into tissues through particular mechanisms . For this reason , FA uptake can be regulated according to the metabolic needs in order to prevent the potential effects of excessive FA accumulation ( Ehehalt et al . , 2006 ) . Different proteins are involved in mammalian cells FA uptake : FATP ( fatty acid transport protein ) , FABPpm ( fatty acid – binding protein - plasma membrane ) , GPR ( G protein coupled receptors ) , and lipid microdomains FAT / CD36 ( fatty acid translocase ) . The FATPs ( fatty acid transport proteins ) ( FATP1 – 6 ) family are a multifunctional set of proteins present in plasma membrane , or intracellular organelles , that are implicated through different functions in lipid metabolism . FATP1 , FATP2 and FATP4 are involved in either fatty acid transport , or very long chain fatty acid activation ( Black et al . , 2009 ) . Besides FATPs , also the plasma membrane associated FA - binding proteins ( FABPs ) , known as intracellular lipid chaperons are small cytosolic proteins that bind reversibly to long chain fatty acids ( C16 - C20 ) , and eicosanoids ( Mishkin et al . , 1972 ; Furuhashi and Hotamisligil , 2008 ) . Nine ( FABP1 – FABP9 ) out of 12 FABPs Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin . org 02 Hoxha and Zappacosta 10 . 3389 / fphar . 2022 . 1032806 forms discovered are expressed in humans ( Storch and Thumser , 2010 ; Smathers and Petersen , 2011 ) . FABPs are implicated in FAs storage , import , export , and signaling ( Smathers and Petersen , 2011 ) . Once inside , FAs are bound by cytosolic - FABP , which stimulates not only FA absorption , but also its cytoplasmic redistribution ( McArthur et al . , 1999 ) . For instance , the intestinal isoform of FABP can bind to free long chain fatty acids and lead to fatty acid absorption ( Furuhashi and Hotamisligil , 2008 ; Smathers and Petersen , 2011 ) . FABP genes expression in human CRC was studied . Prayugo et al . reported that numerous FABP genes are altered in CRC patients , and that FABP6 could be a potential biomarker of colorectal adenocarcinomas ( Prayugo et al . , 2021 ) . Bile acids that are increased in colon adenomas and cause DNA damage and apoptosis in colonic epithelium are thought to be responsible of the raised FABP6 expression in early - stage carcinogenesis in CRC ( Imray et al . , 1992 ; Fujii et al . , 1993 ) . Interestingly , FABP6 expression is also thought to be linked to insulin - like growth factor ( IGF ) signaling in CRC ( Nowakowska - Zajdel et al . , 2011 ) . FABP4 levels are also increased in CRC patients ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . Over the past two decades , G protein coupled receptors ( GPRs ) have been systematically “ de - orphanized ” . Regarding the fatty acid uptake , speci ﬁ cally GPR40 , 41 and 43 are capable of recognizing either short ( GPR41 and GPR43 ) , medium or long chain FA ( GPR40 ) , responsible of mediating the signalling regulatory effects of these nutrients . GPR120 , highly expressed in the intestine , regulates FA - induced glucagon - like peptide one secretion ( Husted et al . , 2017 ) . In addition GPRs are also involved in CRC . FFAR ( free fatty acid receptor ) , speci ﬁ cally FFAR2 ( GPR43 ) , FFAR3 ( GPR41 ) , that are FIGURE 1 Overallfattyacids ( FAs ) biosynthesisandmetabolism : The denovo synthesisstartsfromglucosethatgeneratescitrate . Citratecanbecleavedby ATP - citrate lyase ( ACLY ) to acetyl - CoA that is also metabolized from acetate generated by acetyl - CoA carboxylases ( ACSS2 ) . After carboxylation , acetyl - CoA ( as well as malonyl - CoA ) is condensed by FA synthase ( FASN ) to give rise to palmitate . Palmitate is catalyzed by the stearoyl - CoA desaturase ( SCD1 ) to synthetize monounsaturated fatty acids ( MUFAs ) such as oleate and palmitoleate by introducing a double bond between carbons 9 and 10 of the acyl - CoA substrate . MUFAs are desaturated by a desaturase in plants to generate polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) . Moreover , cyclooxygenases ( COXs ) are able to metabolize PUFAs from 20 - carbons to synthetize bioactive lipids with pro or anti - tumor activity ( according to the substrate ) . Whereas , exogenous or endogenous PUFAs are elongated and desaturated by FA elongases ( ELOVLs ) that add two carbons and desaturases ( FADSs ) - that add a double - bound between carbon .

Controversial studies report either the role of FFAR2 in potentiating colon tumorigenesis , or suppressing it through activation of caspases ( Hatanaka et al . , 2010 ; Tang et al . , 2011 ) . FFAR3 can stimulate cell proliferation , and enhance colon tumorigenesis ( Wu et al . , 2012 ) . GPR109A highly expressed in colon is involved in colon cancer ( Kimura et al . , 2020 ) . G protein - coupled estrogen receptor ( GPER ) that is implicated in FASN modulation can suppress CRC progression , despite some controversial studies reporting a promoting role of GPER in CRC ( Santolla et al . , 2012 . ; Gilligan et al . , 2017 ) . Lipid rafts are microdomains present at the plasma membrane of cells that act as mediators between the internal and external compartments of the cell ( Ikonen 2001 ) . The fatty acids inside the lipid raft tend to form a solid compartment . Fatty acid translocase ( FAT / CD36 ) association with lipid rafts can regulate FA uptake . Although CD36 is overexpressed in different cells such as : macrophages , endothelial cells , its role in fatty acid binding and uptake is not well known ( Jay and Hamilton , 2018 ) . It is reported that lipid rafts are involved in metastasis , cell migration / survival , and signal transduction in different type of cancers ( Ma 2007 ; Patra 2008 ) , speci ﬁ cally in colorectal cancer ( Rakheja et al . , 2005 ; Chapkin et al . , 2007 ) . Orlandi and Fishman ( Orlandi & Fishman , 1998 ) were the ﬁ rst to report the implication of lipid rafts in CRC . Lipid rafts are involved in cell proliferation , cell adhesion and death in CRC ( Jahn et al . , 2011 ) . Insulin - like growth factor - I ( IGF - I ) receptor segregation regulate pro and anti apoptotic effects in colon adenocarcinoma FIGURE 2 Polyunsaturated FA ( PUFAs ) and Essential FA ( EFAs ) metabolism : PUFAs can be provided by exogenous uptake from the surrounding microenvironment facilitated by specialized transporters such as the fatty acid transport protein ( FATPs ) , the fatty acid – binding protein - plasma membrane ( FABPpm ) , G - protein coupled receptors ( GPR ) and fatty acid translocase lipid microdomains ( FAT / CD36 ) . In mammals , essential FAs ( EFAs ) suchasLinoleicAcid ( LA18 : 2 ω - 6 ) or α - LinolenicAcid ( ALA18 : 3 ω - 3 ) arebothuptakenbecausetheycannotbesynthetizeendogenously . LA and ALA metabolized competitively by ELOVLS and FADSs that can introduce double bonds at the Δ 5 or Δ 6 position to synthetize long - chain FAs ( LC - FA ) or subsequently , very - long - chain FAs ( VLC - FA ) in peroxisome by Sprecher pathway . Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin . org 04 Hoxha and Zappacosta 10 . 3389 / fphar . 2022 . 1032806 cell lines ( Remacle - Bonnet et al . , 2005 ) . Fatty acid synthase ( FASE ) that is responsible of fatty acids synthesis is overexpressed in CRC , and its inhibition has a substantial role in lipid raft synthesis ( Jahn et al . , 2011 ) . To sum - up , in mammals , FAs can be synthesized endogenously or uptaken from diet through passive diffusion , or by the regulation of speci ﬁ c sets of membrane proteins that ensure FAs uptake . Moreover , even if plants are able to synthesize ω - 3 or ω - 6 PUFAs , in mammals they should only be provided from diet , and both ω - 3 and ω - 6 PUFAs families are essential for homeostasis . 3 Functions of fatty acids in cancer cells The alteration of FA synthesis is responsible of different aspects of cancer growth , such as the energy storage , cell proliferation and survival . Besides lipids , also PUFA derivatives , the eicosanoids ( from C20 fatty acids ) play a role in tumorigenesis and tumor microenvironment ( Röhrig and Schulze , 2016 ) . 3 . 1 Membrane structure and ﬂ uidity Physiologically , cells membranes are mainly composed of phospholipids . PUFAs are esteri ﬁ ed in the sn - 2 position , while MUFAs in the sn - 1 position are esteri ﬁ ed in phospholipids , maintaining the structural integrity of the lipid bilayer membrane , and conferring ﬂ uidity . FAs can be unesteri ﬁ ed thanks to the activity of the phospholipase released in the cytosol as free - fatty acids ( Swinnen et al . , 2019 ) . The alteration of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism is responsible of the very signi ﬁ cant change of membrane lipid composition in cancer cells in respect to normal cells . The higher FIGURE 3 Targetingenzymesinvolvedinfattyacidoxidationorbioactivelipidsynthesis : Cancercellsobtainfattyacids ( FAs ) from denovo lipogenesisand exogenous uptake .

Finally , PUFAsare substrate of COXs enzymes that oxygenate these FAs to bioactive lipids with a differential activity in tumor initiation and progression . The enzymes involved in FA oxidation , as well as those able to give rise to bioactive lipids can be a therapeutic target to hamper tumor progression .

In addition , the higher degree of saturated fatty acid and cholesterol confers rigidity to the cell membrane , interfering with growth , and anti - growth factors , followed by the transduction of the signals to the inside of the cell . The altered growth factor signaling enhances cell growth , and uncontrolled division . The growth factor receptors signaling are either affected by the content of membrane lipids , or explicit mutations / or ampli ﬁ cation in genes encoding growth factor receptors ( Arkhipov et al . , 2013 ) . Yes - associated protein ( YAP ) expression is increased in CRC , and YAP oncogene expression is stimulated by Wnt / β - catenin signaling . Higher levels of YAP and β - catenin are found in the tumor cell nuclei ( Tanton et al . , 2022 ) . Ouahoud et al . reported that the risk of developing CRC is reduced by statins , thus cholesterol plays an important role in CRC through Wnt / ( YAP ) growth signaling pathway ( Ouahoud et al . , 2022 ; Tanton et al . , 2022 ) . 3 . 2 Substrate for ATP synthesis Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) , and glycolysis are the sources of ATP in normal cells , in contrast to cancer cells that obtain ATP mostly from glycolysis ( Shiratori et al . , 2019 ) . The energy metabolism of cancer cells is a potential therapeutic target . β - oxidation , or fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) produce energy through FA degradation . In cancer cells there is a high request for ATP , for phosphorylation reactions , and DNA / RNA replication ( Ma et al . , 2018 ) . FAO inhibition is associated with induction of apoptosis , cytotoxic accumulation of long - chain fatty acids , potentially correlated with the dysregulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production , mitochondrial damages , and NADPH homeostasis ( Menendez and Lupu , 2007 ; Leamy et al . , 2013 ) . 3 . 3 Energy storage Diacylglycerol is esteri ﬁ ed into triacylglycerol , and brings to lipid droplets ( LD ) biogenesis . LDs are storage oragnelles that play an important role in signaling , energy metabolism and in the production of in ﬂ ammatory mediators ( Zoncu et al . , 2011 ; Jaishy and Abel , 2016 ; Olzmann and Carvalho , 2019 ) . LDs are accumulated in a variety of cancer cells and their catabolism is tightly coupled to energetic metabolism . Moreover , LDs catabolism has been also linked to cell signaling and cancer cell proliferation , resistance to death , and aggressiveness . The de novo lipid synthesis and remodeling , the increased lipid uptake , the cross - talk through tumors and other cells are some of the functions of LDs in tumor cells ( Cruz et al . , 2020 ) . Interestingly , in CRC , the LDs are major sites for prostaglandin E 2 ( PGE 2 ) synthesis , an important immune suppressive eicosanoid involved in tumor cell proliferation ( Accioly et al . , 2008 ) . PGE 2 is responsible of inhibiting apoptosis , enhancing angiogenesis , and cell proliferation . Data have shown that either LD , or LD - derived PGE 2 can enhance the proliferation of epithelial cells ( Cruz et al . , 2020 ) . In addition , in CRC , mPGES and COX - 2 are also localized in LDs . In conclusion , FASN inhibitors reduced the LD and PGE 2 synthesis in IEC - 6 H - rasV12 cells ( Accioly et al . , 2008 ) . 3 . 4 Pro - tumorigenic signalling molecules Phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) / Akt pathway is the most common dysregulated signalling pathway in human cancers , which could be activated by growth - factor receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) , and is also associated with the activation of rapamycin ( mTOR ) complexes . In addition , PI3K – AKT signaling inhibits β - oxidation and lipolysis , and promotes lipid synthesis ( Fazolini et al . , 2015 ) . Anabolic metabolism and de novo lipogenesis are activated through mTORC1 mechanisms . Cholesterol and lipids may activate the mTOR signalling pathway ( Sabatini 2006 ) . mTORC1 , and mTORC2 are stabilized by phosphatidic acid , which is synthesized de novo by fatty acid metabolism ( Menon et al . , 2017 ) . Data have shown that mTORC1 complex is also stimulated by exogenous unsaturated fatty acids , such as exogenous oleic acid through the de novo synthesis of phosphatidic acid ( Fingar and Blenis , 2004 ; Menon et al . , 2017 ) . Liu et al . , showed that PI3K plays a role as inducer of chemoresistance in CRC ( Liu et al . , 2017 ) , and in CRC patients , PIK3CA mutation leads to the activation of PI3K / Akt signaling , and chemotherapy resistance ( Wang et al . , 2018a ) . Phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ) , a negative regulator of PI3K signaling , is also a tumor suppressor with an important role in the metabolism of glucose and lipids , that works in the nucleus . SREBP and FASN induction brings to increased de novo lipogenesis , as a consequence of hepatic loss of PTEN ( Stiles et al . , 2004 ; Chen et al . , 2018 ) . PTEN changes in CRC are linked with BRAF mutations , lymph node metastases ( Salvatore et al . , 2019 ) . Wang et al . , showed that SIRT3 / PTEN / AKT / RHEB / MTOR / HIF1 α signal pathway promotes tumor proliferation ( Wang et al . , 2018b ) . Data have reported that around 40 % of colon cancers have a KRAS mutation , which are associated with a higher tumor aggressiveness ( Malumbres and Barbacid , 2003 ) . The signal transduction of KRAS effector proteins reduce apoptosis , and increase angiogenesis . The mutant KRAS upregulates the fatty acid synthase , ATP citrate lyase , and acetyl coenzyme A Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin . org 06 Hoxha and Zappacosta 10 . 3389 / fphar . 2022 . 1032806 carboxylase , controlling de novo lipogenesis ( Pupo et al . , 2019 ) . Plasma membrane proteolipid composition is altered by the presence of EPA and DHA through the suppression of KRAS phenotypes both in vivo and in vitro , and by the alteration of pERK ( Fuentes et al . , 2018 ) . Interestingly , KRAS gene mutation is associated with a reduced response to anti - epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) agents ( Lievre et al . , 2006 ; Phipps et al . , 2013 ) . Point substitutions in codons 12 and 13 , the most common KRAS mutations are considered as negative predictors of EGFR antibodies response . This can bring to the development of new personalized therapies , based on the type of KRAS mutation ( Dinu et al . , 2014 ) . Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) , platelet - derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) , ﬁ broblast growth receptor ( FGR ) are receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) cell surface receptors characterized by an extracellular domain ( ectodomains ) , whose activation induces PI3K / AKT / mTOR , and RAS kinase pathways ( Jin et al . , 2019 ) . In CRC different mutations can activate RTKs . The mutation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) leads to C16 saturated fatty acid production ( Bollu et al . , 2015 ) . 3 . 5 Eicosanoids remodel the tumor microenvironment PUFAs are the precursors of prostanoids involved in in ﬂ ammation . Speci ﬁ cally , the mediators deriving from C20 - FAs are named eicosanoids . Prostanoids that include leukotrienes , thromboxanes and prostaglandins are potent signaling molecules synthesized by a diverse set of enzymes during in ﬂ ammation . Among them , the PGE 2 is the major cyclooxygenase ( COX ) product , that has a signi ﬁ cant role in cardiovascular , gastrointestinal , and renal system , and is also involved in cancer . Several studies , in fact indicate higher levels of PGE 2 in colon , colon , lung and neck cancer ( Lenihan - Geels et al . , 2016 ) . In ﬂ ammatory cells and ﬁ broblasts in ﬁ ltrate within the tumor microenvironment ( TME ) in the intestine interacting through chemokines and cytokines with CRC cells , to enhance tumor progression and growth . PGE 2 inhibition might suppress CRC progression ( Aoki and Narumiya , 2017 ) . 4 Potential therapeutic strategies in CRC : New trend and future prospective Considering the implication of FAs in cancer pathogenesis , new pharmacological therapies can be developed by targeting FA metabolic reprogramming . As shown in Figure 3 , targeting the enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) , or bioactive lipids from PUFAs , as well as designing a personalized food - plan as coadjuvant therapeutical strategy might likely hamper tumor progression . 4 . 1 Harboring the anabolic metabolism and oncogenic signaling 4 . 1 . 1 Targeting the fatty acid synthase FASN is the enzyme responsible of the conversion of acetyl - CoA and malonyl - CoA in palmitate . FASN is a precursor of cholesterol and glycerophospholipids and has a signi ﬁ cant role for energy storage . Studies have demonstrated that de novo lipogenesis supplies cancer cells with suf ﬁ cient energy , and signaling lipid molecules to enhance fast cell proliferation ( Buckley et al . , 2017 ) . Two FASN isoforms ( FASN I and FASN II ) have been denoted among living organisms . FASNI is present in fungi and animals , whereas , FASNII in prokaryotes and plants ( Röhrig and Schulze , 2016 ) . The rationale for using FASN inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy derives from the well known cellular effects of FASN inhibition such as : the palmitate synthesis blockade , alteration of plasma membrane structure , oncogenic signal transduction inhibition ( e . g . β - catenin , Wnt , and Akt signalling ) , gene expression reprogramming , and tumor cell apoptosis induction ( Mullen and Yet , 2015 ) . The inhibition of FASN causes a reduction in de novo palmitate synthesis and consequent palmitoylation , an alternative approach to block oncoprotein activation . Examples of palmitoylated proteins include tubulin and EGFR , as well as RAS - family GTPases that require palmitoylation to promote tumor formation activity . For these reasons , the existing drugs that target FASN are one advantageous aspect of this approach ( Ko and Dixon , 2018 ) . In the last years , different FASN inhibitors have been studied . Cerulenin ( an antifungal antibiotic capable of inhibiting the FASN reductase activity ) , as well as Orlistat ( a drug widely used for obesity treatment ) , C75 , TVB - 3166 and TVB - 2640 were used in preclinical models of breast cancer . In particular , C75 was showed to prevent breast cancer development in HER2 - transgenic mice . In addition , C75 blocked DNA replication and triggered apoptosis ( Menendez and Lupu , 2017 ) . In preclinical models of mesothelioma ( Gabrielson et al . , 2001 ) , as well as in renal ( Horiguchi et al . , 2008 ) , lung ( Relat et al . , 2012 ) , and prostate cancer ( Zadra et al . , 2019 ) it has been shown how FASN inhibition was able to modulate the proliferation and to induce apoptosis in cancer cells . Regarding CRC , only one inhibitor was tested successfully . In particular , TVB - 3664 that was used in CRC patient - derived xenografts ( PDXs ) , reduced tumor volume in 30 % of the cases , with no signi ﬁ cant toxicity . The antitumor effect of TVB - 3664 was associated with variations in lipid composition . Akt , AMPK , Erk1 / 2 were among the oncogenic pathways altered ( Zaytseva et al . , 2018 ) . In view of its roles in enhancing anabolic metabolism , and oncogenic signaling , FASN has been widely studied for its therapeutical Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin . org 07 Hoxha and Zappacosta 10 . 3389 / fphar . 2022 . 1032806 role . However , the de novo lipid synthesis should be studied in CRC not only in the Apc - model . In addition , Yekaterina et al . , showed that another FASN inhibitor , TVB - 2640 ( currently on Phase I and II clinical trials ) studied in patients with solid tumor showed a good tolerability pro ﬁ le ( Yekaterina et al . , 2016 ; National Cancer Institute , 2018 ) . TVB - 3693 , and TVB - 3664 were also studied in CRC cells . Findings report that the FASN inhibition response can be measured through the basal levels of pAMPK and pAkt , and FASN inhibitors can have a potential effect either in the treatment of early CRC , or as prevention therapy ( Cruz et al . , 2014 ; Yekaterina et al . , 2016 ; Drury et al . , 2022 ) . Indeed , low mitochondrial respiration , low glycolysis , are a result of FASN deletion , suggesting that fatty acid synthesis upregulation foster tumorigenesis ( Bueno et al . , 2019 ; Drury et al . , 2022 ) . 4 . 2 Limiting the metabolic substrates for lipogenesis 4 . 2 . 1 Targeting the ATP citrate lyase Citrate and coenzyme A ( CoA ) are converted to acetyl - CoA and oxaloacetate through ATP citrate lyase ( ACLY ) , an enzyme linking lipid and glycolitic metabolism . Low levels of fatty acids , and high levels of carbohydrates activate the de novo synthesis of fatty acids in cancer cells , which is followed by the conversion of glucose to pyruvate by glycolysis . In Krebs cycle , pyruvate is converted through pyruvate dehydrogenase in acetyl - CoA . The rest of the puyrvate is excreted as lactate ( Granchi 2018 ) . The regulation of cholesterol or fatty acids synthesis in obese or hyperlipidemic patients , could be potentially achieved through the use of ACLY inhibitors . The interest of shifting towards the use of ACLY inhibitors as anticancer agents is growing because ACLY overexpression increased acetyl - CoA that is necessary for lipid synthesis , and histone acetylation reactions , that regulate the expression of proteins involved in proliferation . ACLY levels are increased in CRC and other cancer types ( breast cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma ) . ACLY inhibition brings to changes in cancer cell metabolism ( Khwairakpam et al . , 2015 ) . Currently , SB - 204990 has been studied in pre - clinical models of lung and prostate cancer ( Hatzivassiliou et al . , 2005 ) . Indeed , ACLY inhibitors could be a potential therapeutic alternative in cancer . 4 . 2 . 2 Targeting the Acetyl - CoA synthetases 2 In contrast to normal cells , cancer cells cannot obtain suf ﬁ cient acetyl - CoA from pyruvate when shifted from mitochondrial respiration to aerobic glycolysis , therefore proprionate , acetate , butyrate and glutamine are other sources of acetyl - CoA in cancer cells . Acetyl - CoA is a precursor of lipid synthesis and is produced by the conversion of acetate through acetyl - CoA synthase ( ACSS ) , which exists in three forms : ACSS - 1 , - 2 , - 3 . Data have shown an overexpression of ACSS - 2 in different types of cancer , such as breast carcinomas , hepatocellular carcinomas ( Pandey et al . , 2018 ) . In particular the role of ACSS - 2 in CRC should be further studied because the fermentation by intestinal micro ﬂ ora is the primary source of the production of acetate . It has been shown that CRC decreased the ACSS - 2 expression ( Bae et al . , 2017 ) . Moreover , a correlation between breast and prostate cancer with acetate metabolism and ACSS - 2 activity has been identi ﬁ ed . In low - oxygen and lipid - depleted conditions , ACSS - 2 overexpression contributes to cancer cell growth ( Schug et al . , 2015 ) . Up - to - date , only one inhibitor has been described in cancer . The N - ( 2 , 3 - di - 2 - thienyl - 6 - quinoxalinyl ) - N ’ - ( 2 - methoxyethyl ) urea ( CAS 508186 - 14 - 9 ) has been used in preclinical models of bladder cancer ( Comerford et al . , 2014 ; Wen et al . , 2019 ) . Even if the current evidence have widely proved that acetate is an essential nutrient for cancer growth , the therapeutical role of ACSS - 2 is not fully explored . 4 . 3 Inhibiting fatty acid desaturation 4 . 3 . 1 Targeting the stearoyl - CoA desaturase The stearoyl - CoA desaturase ( SCD ) is a an enzyme with a signi ﬁ cant role in controlling lipogenesis . SCD1 is responsible of the production of monounsaturated fatty acids ( MUFAs ) from saturated fatty acids ( SFAs ) , and is a regulator of weight gain following high carbohydrate diets ( ALJohani et al . , 2017 ) . The increased activity of SCD1 was observed in metastatic breast cancer , while low levels of SCD1 substrate , stearic acid in phosphatodylcholine were found in tumors associated with metastasis ( Mounier et al . , 2014 ) . SCD1 overexpression reduces survival in prostate , liver , lung , kidney , and breast cancer ( Ntambi , 1999 ) . Currently , at least three different inhibitors have been identi ﬁ ed . SSI - 4 was already used in a preclinical model of hepatocellular carcinoma ( Ma et al . , 2017 ) , while the betulinic acid , as well as MF - 438 were both employed in preclinical models of CRC and lung cancers , respectively ( Potze et al . , 2016 ; Pisanu et al . , 2017 ) . Moreover , it has been found a positive association between CRC patient ’ s clinical status and SCD1 expression . In the same study , SCD1 expression was associated with cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) - related genes ( WNT and NOTCH signaling ) . Targeting CSCs , as a subpopulation of cells responsible of tumor resistance and recurrence has received major attention as potential therapeutic target ( Choi et al . , 2019 ) . Biochemical analysis on the role of SCD1 blockade in target stem - like cell activity in CRC may give a further rationale for the development of innovative CRC therapeutic agents . Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin . org 08 Hoxha and Zappacosta 10 . 3389 / fphar . 2022 . 1032806 4 . 4 Interfering with pro - in ﬂ ammatory process 4 . 4 . 1 Targeting the cyclo - oxigenase Arachidonic acid is transformed through cyclooxygenase ( COX ) in prostaglandins and thromboxane A 2 , and exists in three isoforms . Studies have shown that COX - 2 isoform is overexpressed in a series of cancers in humans , such as breast , ovarian , brain , head and neck , stomach cancer , and enhancing proliferation , apoptotitc resistence , in ﬂ ammation and metastasis of cancer cells ( Diakos et al . , 2014 ) . COX - 2 is also released by macrophage type 2 , cancer cells , and cancer - associated ﬁ broblasts to the tumor area . Interestingly , data demonstrate that in high risk patients the use of non - steroidal anti - in ﬂ ammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , and of COX - 2 inhibitors ( COXIBs ) contribute in the prevention , or delay of the onset ( or recurrence ) of tumors , even in patients with prior removal of CRC ( Vara - Messler et al . , 2015 ; Davis et al . , 2017 ) . Different studies have evidenced the signi ﬁ cant potential role of NSAIDs in reducing the risk of cancer , and speci ﬁ cally of CRC ( Thun et al . , 2012 ; Rothwell 2013 ; Piazuelo and Lanas , 2015 ; Drew et al . , 2016 ) . In addition , the main metabolite of COX - 2 , PGE 2 is present in colon , and in CRC its levels are increased , either with the disease progression , or with tumor size ( Stamatakis et al . , 2015 ; Karpisheh et al . , 2019 ) . Overall , COX inhibitors represent a promising group of drugs used as chemotherapeutic agents with a great potential for both , CRC prevention and treatment . However , further clinical studies are needed to evaluate not only the undesirable side effects , but also whether COX inhibition is effective in all types of CRC dietary interventions and cancer therapies . Apart of the energy intake , the role of diet composition has received less attention . In a normocaloric diet , 30 % of energy supply comes from lipid intake , from which polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) comprise around 7 – 10 % of daily energy intake . In different types of tumors , fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) is the favored process for ATP production ( Kanarek et al . , 2020 ) . Some tumors activate FAO under metabolic stress ( Schafer et al . , 2009 ; Zaugg et al . , 2011 ; Carracedo et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , FAO also in ﬂ uences the redox balance . In fact , it has been shown that the human glioblastoma cell line oxidizes fatty acids , and moreover the inhibition of FAO controls the NADPH level ( Pike et al . , 2011 ) . The calorie restriction has been widely studied and associated with improved health , and delay of age - related pathologies ( Mihaylova et al . , 2014 ) . Calorie restriction modi ﬁ es ISC function by affecting Paneth cells ( Harris and Thorner , 2012 ; Igarashi and Guarente , 2016 ) . EPA and DHA compete with AA for COX - 2 , and give rise to PGE 3 instead of PGE 2 , a very well known prostanoid with pro - in ﬂ ammatory and tumor activity ( Vara - Messler et al . , 2015 ; Koundouros and Poulogiannis , 2020 ) . The recommended dietary ratio of ω - 6 : 3 FAs is 1 : 1 ; although , the Western diet , rich in saturated FA , cholesterol , as well as in ω - 6 , has an ω - 6 : 3 FAs ratio of 15 : 1 , with an important role in the progression of different cancers including CRC ( Vara - Messler et al . , 2017 ; Adams et al . , 2019 ) . In fact , both a high - fat diet ( HFD ) rich in palmitic acid , a saturated fatty acid , as well as cholesterol - rich diet , directly alter intestinal stem cells and progenitor function . It has been demonstrated that the HFD induce obesity augmenting stemness and thus , tumorigenicity of intestinal progenitors ( Beyaz et al . , 2016 ) . Considering that the energy source , metabolic activity , and nutrient requirements can be different in various type of cancers , a speci ﬁ c diet combined with therapies could have a potential effect in improving patient conditions . Several studies evidence the role of enzymes , and the way the pharmacological targeting can limit the metabolic substrates for lipogenesis across several tumor types . Beside the intervention on endogenous lipid , some studies are now evaluating the high degree of inter - individual variability in metabolizing FAs ( including those from diet ) . This complex approach may partially explain , the con ﬂ icting results coming from clinical trials of human cancer when patients were supplemented with fatty acids as a coadjutant therapy . 4 . 4 . 2 Cyclopentenone prostaglandins , lipoxins and resolvins in the treatment of CRC Cyclopentenone prostaglandins ( cyPGs ) , PGA 1 , PGA 2 , PGJ 2 , 15 - Deoxy - Δ - 12 , 14 - Prostaglandin J 2 ( 15d - PGJ 2 ) and Δ 12 - PGJ 2 are a group of prostaglandins that increase apoptosis , resolve in ﬂ ammation , have anti - metastatic and anti - angiogenic properties ( Lee et al . , 2021 ) . PGA 1 is produced from linoleic acid ( Whelan and Fritsche , 2013 ) . Among cyPGs , PGJ 2 , 15d - PGJ 2 , and D 12 - PGJ 2 are expressed in human colorectal cancer cell line HCA - 7 . 15d - PGJ 2 has proapoptotic and antitumor activity in CRC ( Chen and Tseng , 2005 ) . Upregulation of 15 - PGDH gene expression through activation of activating protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) is one of the mechanisms reported for the antitumor properties of 15d - PGJ 2 in human colon cancer cell line HCT - 116 ( Park and Na , 2019a ; Park and Na , 2019b ) . To date , it has been reported that in HCA - 7 cells the major route of metabolization of PGH 2 is through glutathione ( GSH ) conjugation ( Cox et al . , 2002 ) . Lipoxins ( LXs ) and resolvins ( RVs ) are proresolving lipids that display anti - in ﬂ ammatory and anticarcinogenic activity . 5S , 12R , 18R - trihydroxy - 6Z , 8E , 10E , 14Z , 16E - eicosapentaenoic acid ( RVE1 ) reduce the in ﬂ ammation in colon mucosa ( Hudert et al . , 2006 ) . Lipoxin A 4 ( LXA 4 ) , which levels are reduced in CRC , inhibit both the proliferation , and migration of CRC cells ( Liu et al . , 2019 ) . Janakiram et al . , reported that the direct administration of RVs , and LXA 4 can have a potential role in attenuating the in ﬂ ammation in colon cancer by either inhibiting , or reducing the cytokines production ( Janakiram et al . , 2011 ) . Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin . org 09 Hoxha and Zappacosta 10 . 3389 / fphar . 2022 . 1032806 5 Conclusion and future perspectives Lastly , the rewiring of FA metabolism in cancer has been widely studied because proliferating cancer cells can produce energy to obtain enough ATP for new biomass synthesis . Moreover , FA metabolism has been studied as a cell intrinsic event , considering the regulation of lipid homeostasis in oncogenic pathways , and the capacity to modify the cell membrane composition and ﬂ uidity . On the other hand , the study of FAs became interesting due to the ability to in ﬂ uence concomitant biological events related to tumor progression , since FAs are also able to remodel the tumor microenvironment by paracrine - signaling mechanism . In terms of therapeutic strategies , both from an intrinsic cellular point of view , as well as from its paracrine functions related to the role in the tumor microenvironment , the management of the enzymes that target FA metabolism in cancer treatment , as well as dietary interventions will improve the outcome of cancer treatment . The complexity of FA metabolism and their by - products , including the interactions with the tumor microenvironment and nutrient accessibility are important issues to be faced before developing new pharmacological targets of FA pathway ’ s . We focused on the role of FAs rewiring metabolism in CRC because is a lethal disease with a high mortality rate , despite the attempts to ﬁ nd new treatments and improve the existing ones . Currently , the most common therapeutic approach to treat metastatic CRC foresees the combination of chemotherapy with biological agents , such as monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR or blocking angiogenesis . A major limitation in treatment is that more than half of CRC patients are not eligible because of genetic defects , such as KRAS mutations . KRAS mutated CRC are associated with enhanced proliferation that increase the fuel need for growth and spread . In particular , KRAS - CRC may activate fatty acid synthesis to get a higher supply of energy or to induce the palmitoylation of membrane receptors , and for this reason FA pathways could have a potential metabolic vulnerability . Interestingly , plasmalogens , a group of glycerophospholipids might act as a potential biomarker for CRC screening ( Fernandes et al . , 2020 ) . In speci ﬁ c , in colon tumors plasmalogen changes are associated with an increase in phosphatidylcholine ( Dueck et al . , 1996 ) . Moreover , apoptopic genes modulation ( caspase - 8 and 9 activation , BBcl - 2 pro - apoptotic family , PPAR α and γ , LOX and prostaglandins , reduction of TCF - β - catenin genes expression ( survivin ) ) could be potential therapeutic target for novel pharmacological compounds in CRC ( Liu and Ma , 2014 ; Calviello et al . , 2007 ; D ’ Eliseo and Velotti , 2016 ) . Oxylipins , oxidized lipids that can be produced in enzymatic reactions , catalyzed by COX , LOX , and CYP450 are also studied recently in colorectal cancer , in which lower levels of 12 - keto - LTB4 and 9 - HODE and 13 - HODE were shown ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ; Chistyakov et al . , 2022 ) . Nowadays , advances in the ﬁ eld of CRC metabolism promise for the implementation of novel combinatorial strategies that exploit FAs dependency of cancer cells . In this context , many questions should be elucidated : How does FA metabolic pathway in ﬂ uence the adenoma and carcinoma sequence - progression ? Which is the role of FA pathway on driving stemness and the related tumor progression ? How does the FA metabolism in ﬂ uence metastasis ? How are FAs involved on metabolic plasticity ? Is the resistance to the current therapy related to FA metabolism ? Managing these questions from bench - to - beside will contribute to the design of personalized therapeutic strategies that will improve the outcome of CRC .
