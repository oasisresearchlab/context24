REVIEW Open Access Fraternal twins : Swiprosin - 1 / EFhd2 and Swiprosin - 2 / EFhd1 , two homologous EF - hand containing calcium binding adaptor proteins with distinct functions Sebastian Dütting , Sebastian Brachs , Dirk Mielenz * Abstract Changes in the intracellular calcium concentration govern cytoskeletal rearrangement , mitosis , apoptosis , transcriptional regulation or synaptic transmission , thereby , regulating cellular effector and organ functions . Calcium binding proteins respond to changes in the intracellular calcium concentration with structural changes , triggering enzymatic activation and association with downstream proteins . One type of calcium binding proteins are EF - hand super family proteins . Here , we describe two recently discovered homologous EF - hand containing adaptor proteins , Swiprosin - 1 / EF - hand domain containing 2 ( EFhd2 ) and Swiprosin - 2 / EF - hand domain containing 1 ( EFhd1 ) , which are related to allograft inflammatory factor - 1 ( AIF - 1 ) . For reasons of simplicity and concision we propose to name Swiprosin - 1 / EFhd2 and Swiprosin - 2 / EFhd1 from now on EFhd2 and EFhd1 , according to their respective gene symbols . AIF - 1 and Swiprosin - 1 / EFhd2 are already present in Bilateria , for instance in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenhorhabditis elegans . Swiprosin - 2 / EFhd1 arose later from gene duplication in the tetrapodal lineage . Secondary structure prediction of AIF - 1 reveals disordered regions and one functional EF - hand . Swiprosin - 1 / EFhd2 and Swiprosin - 2 / EFhd1 exhibit a disordered region at the N - terminus , followed by two EF - hands and a coiled - coil domain . Whereas both proteins are similar in their predicted overall structure they differ in a non - homologous stretch of 60 amino acids just in front of the EF - hands . AIF - 1 controls calcium - dependent cytoskeletal rearrangement in innate immune cells by means of its functional EF - hand . We propose that Swiprosin - 1 / EFhd2 as well is a cytoskeleton associated adaptor protein involved in immune and brain cell function . Pro - inflammatory conditions are likely to modulate expression and function of Swiprosin - 1 / EFhd2 . Swiprosin - 2 / EFhd1 , on the other hand , modulates apoptosis and differentiation of neuronal and muscle precursor cells , probably through an association with mitochondria . We suggest furthermore that Swiprosin - 2 / EFhd1 is part of a cellular response to oxidative stress , which could explain its pro - survival activity in neuronal , muscle and perhaps some malignant tissues . Introduction Calcium ions ( Ca 2 + ) regulate enzyme activities , cytoske - letal and transcriptional regulation , mitosis or apoptosis , gene expression , synaptic communication and homeos - tasis of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) [ 1 ] . Changes in the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration therefore control cellular effector as well as organ functions , such as immune cell activation or brain function , to name only a few . Ca 2 + signaling is a consequence of temporary and / or local increases in the intracellular Ca 2 + concen - tration , through the opening of Ca 2 + channels in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and the plasma membrane . Ca 2 + acts as a ubiquitous , diffusible second messenger that is stored in the ER and mitochondria . It diffuses from the ER into the cytoplasm due to opening of Ca 2 + channels in the ER membrane in response to increases in inositol - 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) , a metabolite of the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) by members of the PI - phospholipase C family of * Correspondence : dmielenz @ molmed . uni - erlangen . de Division of Molecular Immunology , Department of Medicine III , Nikolaus Fiebiger Center , University of Erlangen - Nürnberg , 91054 Erlangen , Germany Dütting et al .

A wide variety of cell surface receptors includ - ing growth factor receptors , cytokine receptors , G - protein coupled receptors ( GPCR ) , integrins , the high affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) - Fc ε R1 - on mast cells as well as B and T cell receptors ( BCR and TCR ) can activate phospholipase C enzymes directly and indirectly through different mechanisms [ 2 ] . The depletion of intracellular Ca 2 + stores and the concomi - tant rise in the cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration induces influx of extracellular Ca 2 + across the plasma membrane through store operated calcium entry ( SOCE ) and cal - cium release activated calcium ( CRAC ) channels . Key players in this process are stromal interaction mole - cules 1 and 2 ( STIM1 and 2 ) , which sense the deple - tion of ER Ca 2 + stores , and ORAI1 , which represents a pore subunit of the CRAC channel ( for review see references [ 3 , 4 ] ) . Ca 2 + - binding proteins of the EF - hand super family [ 5 - 7 ] are involved in all of the above - mentioned cellular processes . EF - hand bearing proteins are heterogeneous in their structures and calcium binding properties . R . H . Kretsinger , who discovered a Ca 2 + - binding helix - loop - helix motif in the structure of Parvalbumin [ 8 ] , named this motif “ EF - hand ” . The corresponding linear sequence motif ( Pfam PF00036 ; http : / / pfam . sanger . ac . uk / ) has thereafter been discovered in the amino acid sequences of many other calcium - binding proteins [ 9 - 13 ] . Here , we provide information about the recently described EF - hand proteins Swiprosin - 1 / EFhd2 and Swiprosin - 2 / EFhd1 , which are related to another EF - hand protein , allograft inflammatory factor - 1 ( AIF - 1 ; also : Iba1 , ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 ) . Although our own work focuses on B cell development and signal - ing we provide information for a broader readership here . There are many synonyms for Swiprosin / EFhd genes , transcripts and proteins ( Additional file 1 , Table S1 ) . Whereas the nomenclature of the genes is unambiguous , alternative names complicate work with the proteins ( Additional file 1 , Table S1 ) . For simplicity and concision , we propose to name the proteins from now on EFhd1 and EFhd2 , according to their respective gene symbols . Hence , we will refer in this review and future publications to Swiprosin - 1 / EFhd2 as EFhd2 and to Swiprosin - 2 / EFhd1 as EFhd1 . EFhd2 and EFhd1 exhibit similar predicted secondary structures ( http : / / elm . eu . org ) ( Figure 1a ) , with disor - dered regions at the N - terminus , predicted and func - tional SH3 - domain binding sites [ 14 ] , followed by two EF - hands and a coiled - coil domain at the C - terminus . Both proteins bind indeed Ca 2 + [ 15 , 16 ] and exhibit a high degree of sequence identity at the protein level ( 64 . 58 % ) ( Figure 1b ) . The only significantly different region are amino acids ( aa ) 20 - 80 ( referring to the num - bering of EFhd2 ) . A part of this region ( aa 70 - 78 ) has been shown by us to be important for targeting EFhd2 to detergent resistant membranes ( DRM ) in the murine B cell line WEHI231 [ 14 ] . Both EFhd2 [ 14 ] and EFhd1 ( Additional file 2 , Figure S1 ) are conserved amongst species , with an orthologue of EFhd2 in Drosophila melanogaster ( CG10641 ) . Interestingly , regarding EFhd2 and EFhd1 from the same species ( Figure 1a ) , or either EFhd2 [ 14 ] and EFhd1 ( Additional file 2 , Figure S1 ) from different species , aa 20 - 80 differ the most . Since EFhd2 and EFhd1 are so similar in their other domains , this part of the proteins is likely to specify distinct func - tions of EFhd2 and EFhd1 . One would therefore assume that EFhd2 and EFhd1 bind proteins redundantly as well as uniquely . When expressed in the same cellular con - text , EFhd2 and EFhd1 might transmit Ca 2 + signals into a different signaling outcome , especially because there is so far no evidence for an interaction of EFhd2 with EFhd1 ( D . M . et al . , unpublished data ) . Evolution of the genes encoding AIF - 1 ( aif1 ) , EFhd2 ( efhd2 ) and EFhd1 ( efhd1 ) The first efhd / aif1 precursor gene is present in an ancestral species of the animal taxon Bilateria ( Figure 2 ; http : / / www . treefam . org / cgi - bin ) . This ancient gene underwent duplication in an unknown species , giving rise to two branches . One branch represents efhd and aif1 , both of which gene products exhibit EF - hand domains ( one in AIF - 1 and two in EFhd ) . The other branch represents a gene encoding a unique protein in C . elegans ( WP : CE38519 ) ( Figure 2 , bottom ) that con - sists only of a coiled - coil domain at the C - terminus ( not shown ) . The efhd gene products contain a disor - dered region , two central EF - hands and a C - terminal coiled - coil domain whereas AIF - 1 contains only a dis - ordered region and two EF - hands , the second of which is degenerate . Accordingly , the homology between aif1 and efhd genes is restricted to the region encoding the EF - hand domains ( representative result for murine EFhd2 is shown in Additional file 3 , Figure S2 ) . This suggests that calcium binding is the most prominent feature of this protein family . The aif1 / efhd precursor underwent a second duplication , resulting in aif1 genes and the efhd2 precursor . The efhd2 gene is already present in insects where it represents the only efhd gene ( Figure 2 ) . In one species of the taxon Euteleos - tomi , after the onset of Chordata development , the ancient efhd2 gene was duplicated once more , now representing two genes , efhd2 and efhd1 , encoding for the proteins EFhd2 and EFhd1 . These are - amongst other species - present in man , mouse , rat , chicken , zebrafish and frog . In the tetrapodal lineage , putatively during or before development of Xenopus spec . , there was yet another duplication of the efhd2 gene . Thus , Xenopus tropicalis contains three efhd genes , efhd1 , Dütting et al . Cell Communication and Signaling 2011 , 9 : 2 http : / / www . biosignaling . com / content / 9 / 1 / 2 Page 2 of 14 efhd2 and a third unique gene that is still lacking a proper name ( ensxett00000029488 _ xentr ) . Interestingly , the gene product of ensxett00000029488 _ xentr con - tains no EF - hands , but only disordered regions and a coiled - coil domain . This protein might therefore com - pete with the EF - hand containing Xenopus EFhd2 and EFhd1 for calcium - independent binding partners . In summary , EFhd2 is the ancestral protein , being present for instance in worms and insects , and EFhd2 and EFhd1 co - exist from the euteleostomic lineage on , for instance in zebrafish , frog and later evolutionary stages . This provokes the question as to whether the gene duplication resulting in the efhd1 gene provided an evolutionary advantage . Chromosomal location of the human and murine genes efhd2 and efhd1 The murine efhd2 gene is located on chromosome 4 ( see http : / / www . ensembl . org for further details ) . It contains 4 exons with a long intron between exon 1 and 2 ( 15 kb ) and a long 3 ’ - UTR in exon 4 ( approx . 1 . 6 kb ) . This structure is conserved in humans where the efhd2 gene is located on chromosome 1 . The murine efhd2 gene is located centrally in a susceptibility locus for SLE ( Systemic Lupus Erythematodes ) ( LMB - 1 , close to D4Mit33 ) on chromosome 4 [ 17 ] . The human efhd2 gene lies in the PARK7 locus ( 1p36 . 33 - 1p36 . 12 ) that is associated with autosomal recessive early onset Parkin - son ’ s disease [ 18 ] . For the human efhd2 gene product , EFhd2 , three protein - coding splice variants have been predicted , translating into putative protein products of 177 to 240 aa . The murine efhd1 gene is localized on chromosome 1 . It is also comprised of 4 exons with an even longer intron between exons 1 and 2 ( approx . 25 kb ) , similar to human efhd1 ( chromosome 2 ) . For the human efhd1 gene product , EFhd1 , five protein - coding splice variants are predicted , resulting in potential protein products of 81 to 239 aa .

Cell Communication and Signaling 2011 , 9 : 2 http : / / www . biosignaling . com / content / 9 / 1 / 2 Page 3 of 14 EFhd2 Expression of EFhd2 An enhancer trap screen has identified a Drosophila strain with an intriguing expression pattern in muscle cells and somatic muscle precursor cells . The insertion is in the Drosophila efhd homologue , CG10641 [ 19 ] . Fur - long et al . [ 20 ] revealed expression of CG10641 by micro - array analyses and in situ hybridization during mesoderm development . Estrada et al . show expression of CG10641 in the visceral and somatic mesoderm , stage 9 ventral head mesoderm , stage 10 head mesoderm and in hemo - cytes but did not follow up the expression patter of CG10641 during mesoderm differentiation [ 21 ] . However , based on these expression data Kiefer et al . [ 22 ] propose a function for all Drosophila CG10641 - related genes in muscle . Indeed , Renate Renkawitz - Pohl ’ s group ( C . Horn - bruch and R . Renkawitz - Pohl , personal communication ) shows expression of Drosophila EFhd ( CG10641 encoded ) in hematocytes and during myoblast fusion . The EFhd2 orthologue in C . elegans is expressed in pharynx , body wall muscle , the nervous system and the ventral nerve cord . In zebrafish the associated ESTs are expressed in brain , eye , genitourinary tissue , gills , muscle , and olfac - tory rosettes . In C . elegans , zebrafish and mouse the respective orthologues may have additional functions , including a role in the nervous system [ 22 ] . The latter appears to be true in human and mouse , at least under pathological conditions such as neurodegeneration , schi - zophrenia and alcohol addiction [ 15 , 23 - 25 ] . Muscle is derived from mesoderm but the mesoderm gives also rise for instance to bone ( osteoblasts and osteo - clasts ) , connective tissue and hematopoietic cells . In humans , EFhd2 becomes transiently up - regulated during osteoblast differentiation from human mesenchymal stem cells [ 26 ] . EFhd2 is also up - regulated during differentia - tion of the murine RAW264 macrophage cell line into osteoclasts after treatment with RANK - L ( receptor activa - tor of NF - (cid:1) B ligand ) [ 27 ] . Other cell types of mesodermal origin expressing EFhd2 are particularly immune cells : EFhd2 is expressed in human and primary murine mast cells [ [ 28 , 29 ] ; our unpublished data ] , human and murine B cells [ 30 - 32 ] , in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells [ 32 - 34 ] , nat - ural killer cells ( NK cells ) [ 35 ] and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) [ 36 , 37 ] . PBMC are a heterogeneous cell population of lymphocytes ( ~ 75 % CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and ~ 25 % NK and B cells ) , monocytes and macrophages . In accordance , murine efhd2 mRNA is present at relatively high abundance in total spleen by Northern Blot , at similar levels in liver and lung , and at relatively low amounts in kidney [ 31 ] . The highest expression of efhd2 has , however , been detected in ectodermal tissue , namely brain [ 31 ] . Like - wise , the murine EFhd2 protein was identified in mouse brain [ 38 ] , specifically in brain stem , cerebellum , Figure 2 Phylogeny of EFhd genes . A phylogenetic tree with equal distances between different taxons was generated using efhd1 as search parameter ( http : / / www . treefam . org / cgi - bin ) . Search parameters were : accession number TF320736 / clean / equal distance / show taxa / none / exp / selected species . Only representative species are shown for convenience . On the right hand side the employed transcript sequences are shown . Chick , chicken ( Gallus gallus ) , Brare , zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) , Xentr , frog ( Xenopus tropicalis ) , Cioin , Hydra ( Ciona intestinalis ) , Drome , fruitfly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) , Caeel , worm ( Caenorhabtidis elegans ) . Dütting et al . Cell Communication and Signaling 2011 , 9 : 2 http : / / www . biosignaling . com / content / 9 / 1 / 2 Page 4 of 14 amygdala , striatum , cortex and frontal lobe [ 15 ] as well as in the hippocampus [ 15 , 23 ] . With the exception of microglia cells [ 39 ] it remains to be established which cell type ( s ) in the brain express EFhd2 . Other cells of ectodermal origin expressing EFhd2 are primary immor - talized human keratinocytes [ 40 ] . Finally , during mouse development EFhd2 is detected strongly in ectodermal tissue such as the most rostral foregut and the caudal hindgut at E8 . 5 [ 41 ] . In addition , EFhd2 is also down - regulated in embryos deficient for the transcription factor Foxa2 and is a marker of definitive endoderm [ 41 ] . Inter - estingly , EFhd2 is already present in murine embryonic stem cells ( our unpublished data ) . Cell lines expressing EFhd2 are all murine B cell lines we analyzed ( our unpublished data ) , HeLa cells [ 42 ] and NIH3T3 cells ( our unpublished data ) . In summary , in worm , zebrafish and higher vertebrates EFhd2 is not only expressed during mesoderm development but also in endodermal and ecto - dermal tissues . Whether this is also the case in D . mela - nogaster remains to be determined . Involvement of EFhd2 in immune cell activation Innate immune cells respond to pathogen associated molecular patterns ( PAMP ) and to danger signals released by necrotic cells . Many signaling elements that are important in adaptive immunity have recently also been shown to control innate immunity [ 43 ] . Interest - ingly , signaling molecules of innate immune cells in higher organisms are shared even in Drosophila where they control for instance removal of necrotic tissue [ 43 ] . Although insects do not possess an adaptive immune system and rely solely on their innate immune system , they utilize ITAMs ( immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motifs ) . The ITAM is a tyrosine phosphoryla - tion consensus motif ( YxxLx ( 7 - 12 ) YxxL ) [ 44 ] found in many receptors and co - receptors of the adaptive and innate immune system as well as in ERM ( ezrin , radixin , moesin ) proteins [ 43 ] . When phosphorylated on their tyrosine residues by Src kinases or Syk ( splenic tyrosine kinase ) [ 45 ] , ITAMs bind the SH2 domains of Syk , relieving Syk from autoinhibition and eventually activat - ing it , resulting in a positive feedback loop [ 45 ] . Syk is key to signaling from adaptive as well as many innate immune receptors [ 43 , 46 ] . We have recently shown that murine EFhd2 is a positive regulator of Syk activity in response to BCR stimulation in the murine B cell line WEHI231 [ 14 ] . Hemocytes of insects are crucial players of immune surveillance by migrating through the body , phagocyting invading pathogens and secreting antimicrobial peptides [ 47 ] . One type of hemocytes are the plasmatocytes which resemble mammalian monocytic and macrophage cells [ 47 ] . Differentiated macrophage - like hemocytes of Drosophila express the Drosophila EFhd protein ( C . Hornbruch and R . Renkawitz - Pohl , personal com - munication ) . This fits to other reports revealing Droso - phila EFhd expression in hemocytes [ 48 ] and in the Drosophila S2 cell line which exhibits phagocytotic activity [ 47 ] . Many of the hematopoietic factors have been conserved across taxonomic groups [ 43 ] . Likewise , EFhd2 is expressed in the murine monocyte cell line RAW264 [ 27 ] , in human PBMC [ 36 ] , in microglia cells [ 39 ] and in NK - like cells [ 35 ] . EFhd2 becomes up - regulated - together with actin - in response to stimula - tion of the human monocyte cell line THP - 1 with a recombinant Mycobacterium bovis strain [ 49 ] . This stimulation improved the antigen - presenting capacity of THP - 1 cells , the CD8 + immune response and TNF - a production [ 49 ] . To sum up , EFhd2 is expressed across species in many cell types of the innate and adaptive immune system . It is tempting to speculate that EFhd2 is involved in Syk activation downstream of other immune receptors than the BCR and plays a role in antigen presentation . Connection of EFhd2 to the cytoskeleton Migration and phagocytotic activity of macrophages require a dynamic cytoskeleton . For instance , the small GTPase Cdc42 is required for cellular polarity , forma - tion of filopodia and Fc g - receptor mediated phagocytosis [ 50 , 51 ] . Rac is required for cell migration and Fc g - receptor mediated phagocytosis [ 50 , 52 , 53 ] and Rho is required to retract the trailing edge of migrating cells and for uptake of apoptotic cell fragments [ 50 , 54 ] . EFhd2 is associated with the cytoskeleton in the human mast cell line HMC - 1 and in NK - like cells [ 29 , 35 ] . More specifically , EFhd2 is associated in a caspase - 9 - contain - ing complex with the cytoskeletal protein ezrin [ 55 ] . In the brain of a mouse model ( JNPL3 mouse ) [ 56 ] for neurodegeneration ( frontotemporal dementia and par - kinsonism linked to chromosome 17 ; FTDP - 17 ) , where neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation are induced through transgenic expression of a mutated human tau gene ( htau P301L ) , EFhd2 was identified in a complex with the transgenic human tau protein [ 15 ] . In addition , endogenous EFhd2 and tau associate in brain lysates of humans with Alzheimer ’ s disease and FTDP - 17 [ 15 ] . Finally , EFhd2 becomes dephosphorylated after epider - mal growth factor ( EGF ) stimulation of HeLa cells with the same kinetics as the actin binding protein gelsolin [ 42 ] . Taken together , these data demonstrate that EFhd2 is associated with the cytoskeleton but the exact connec - tion is unknown at present . However , the related AIF - 1 is associated with the cytoskeleton as well and involved in macrophage survival , migration and activation [ 57 ] . Specifically , it augments macrophage phagocytotic activ - ity [ 58 ] . Calcium binding to AIF - 1 by means of its func - tional EF - hand is required for its ability to activate Rac Dütting et al . Cell Communication and Signaling 2011 , 9 : 2 http : / / www . biosignaling . com / content / 9 / 1 / 2 Page 5 of 14 or G - CSF expression in vascular smooth muscle cells [ 59 ] . Similarly , EFhd2 also binds calcium directly [ 15 ] which may lead to interactions with cytoskeletal regula - tors to modulate functions of innate immune cells , such as cell migration , phagocytosis and antigen presentation . In fact , in the human mast cell line HMC - 1 EFhd2 co - localizes with , and modulates F - actin [ 29 ] . Involvement of EFhd2 in NF - (cid:1) B regulation In the human mast cell line HMC - 1 ( which lacks the Fc ε receptor ) EFhd2 augments expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines after phorbol myristyl acetate ( PMA ) / ionomycin stimulation . Similarly , AIF - 1 augments expression of IL - 6 , IL - 12 but also IL - 10 after lipopoly - saccharide ( LPS ) stimulation of macrophages [ 60 ] . Therefore , in macrophages and a mast cell line , perhaps also in primary mast cells ( where EFhd2 is expressed ; our unpublished data ) , EFhd2 appears to reveal pro - inflammatory activities , perhaps through positive regula - tion of the protein kinase C b / nuclear factor (cid:1) B ( PKC b / NF - (cid:1) B ) signaling pathway [ 29 ] . The PKC b pathway is also activated by the BCR downstream of PLC g 2 / Ca 2 + signaling and induces eventually NF - (cid:1) B activation through the Carma1 / Bcl10 / MALT1 complex [ 61 ] . A positive regulation of PKC b / NF - (cid:1) B through EFhd2 would therefore be expected as we showed recently that EFhd2 augments BCR - induced Syk / PLC g 2 / Ca 2 + signal - ing in the murine B cell line WEHI231 [ 14 ] . Unexpect - edly , however , we showed already that EFhd2 rather blocks expression of the anti - apoptotic NF - (cid:1) B target gene bclxL [ 31 ] . An explanation could be that EFhd2 binds calcium directly [ 15 ] and is therefore part of a negative feedback loop preventing NF - (cid:1) B activation after BCR stimulation ( Figure 3 ) . Apoptosis in lympho - cytes is effectively controlled by the transcription factor NF - (cid:1) B [ 62 ] . In the murine B cell line WEHI231 that is susceptible to BCR - induced apoptosis , EFhd2 positively regulates spontaneous and BCR - induced apoptosis [ 31 ] . Silencing of EFhd2 by shRNA augments survival of WEHI231 cells spontaneously and in response to BCR stimulation . In contrast , G1 cell cycle arrest and p27Kip up - regulation are still induced by BCR ligation in the absence of EFhd2 [ 31 ] . To conclude , EFhd2 regulates specifically apoptosis , but not cell cycle arrest in WEHI231 cells . We propose that this is due to suppres - sion of the NF - (cid:1) B pathway in this cell line . The pro - apoptotic activity of EFhd2 was suppressed by three sti - muli that activate NF - (cid:1) B ( CD40 ligation , LPS , and B cell activating factor of the TNF family [ BAFF ] ) [ 31 ] . These data seem to oppose data from the mast cell line HMC - 1 where EFhd2 augmented up - regulation of NF - kB target genes after PMA / ionomycin stimulation [ 29 ] , many of which are anti - apoptotic . However , PMA / iono - mycin stimulation as used in HMC1 cells [ 29 ] and BCR ligation in WEHI231 cells are different stimuli . EFhd2 may enhance BCR - mediated cell death in WEHI231 cells through inhibition of the NF - (cid:1) B pathway but , through an unknown molecular switch , enhance like - wise the NF - (cid:1) B activating and anti - apoptotic activities of CD40 , LPS , and BAFF in combination with BCR stimulation . Engagement of EFhd2 in autoimmune disorders Regulation of the NF - (cid:1) B pathway by EFhd2 , be it posi - tive or negative , together with its expression in innate and adaptive immune cells and its effects on cytokine production [ 29 ] argue for involvement of EFhd2 in nor - mal and pathological immune activation . In fact , PBMC of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients express less EFhd2 protein than PBMC of healthy patients [ 36 ] . Moreover , there is a protease - mediated cleavage of EFhd2 in RA patients [ 37 ] . Expression of pro - apoptotic factors in both B and T cells is important to establish tolerance of the adaptive immune system [ 63 ] . If EFhd2 was down - regulated in B cells their survival might be prolonged . This might contribute to the persistence of autoimmune diseases such as RA and SLE [ 64 ] . Interestingly , the EFhd2 - related AIF - 1 is involved in RA as well [ 57 ] . Moreover , the murine efhd2 gene is Iocated rather cen - trally in an SLE susceptibility region ( LMB - 1 , close to D4Mit33 ) on chromosome 4 [ 17 ] , thereby , representing a putative genetic determinant of SLE . Memory B cells become persistently re - activated in RA and SLE [ 65 ] . In memory B cells as well as in CD4 + and CD8 + memory T cells , efhd2 expression is part of an evolutionary con - served transcriptional signature [ 32 ] . Whether efhd2 expression in immune memory cells is important for their activation , to keep them silent , or to help them patrolling through secondary lymphatic organs is unknown at present but certainly deserves further inves - tigation with respect to autoimmune diseases . EFhd2 and neuropathological disorders Neurodegenerative disorders associated with tau , so - called tauopathies , are characterized by successive deposition of protein aggregates consisting of hyperpho - sphorylated tau [ 66 , 67 ] . In Parkinson ’ s patients , tau and nitrated a - synuclein induce formation of so - called Lewy bodies that are characteristic for Parkinson ’ s disease [ 68 ] . Tau aggregates and Lewy bodies cause synapse loss and neuronal cell death . In addition , neurodegenerative diseases reveal an inflammatory component represented mainly by microglial activation [ 69 ] . There are several lines of evidence that EFhd2 is involved in normal and pathological brain function : First , in microglia cells , EFhd2 becomes up - regulated and secreted in response to stimulation with nitrated a - synuclein [ 39 ] . Very interestingly , the related AIF - 1 ( Iba1 ) is a microglial Dütting et al . Cell Communication and Signaling 2011 , 9 : 2 http : / / www . biosignaling . com / content / 9 / 1 / 2 Page 6 of 14 activation marker [ 70 ] . Second , the brain of a FTDP - 17 mouse model ( JNPL3 mouse ) [ 56 ] where neurodegen - eration and neuroinflammation are induced through transgenic expression of a mutated human tau ( htau P301L ) contains complexes of the transgenic human tau protein and endogenous EFhd2 [ 15 ] ( Figure 3 ) . In addi - tion , endogenous EFhd2 and tau associate in brain lysates of humans with Alzheimer ’ s disease and FTDP - 17 [ 15 ] . Third , EFhd2 is present in membrane rafts of mouse spinal cord , but only when mice over - express a mutant , toxic gain of function form of superoxide dismutase 1 ( SOD1 ) , namely the G93A mutant [ 71 ] ( Figure 3 ) . This mutant is responsible for familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , a chronic , progressive neuromuscular disorder [ 72 ] . Fourth , EFhd2 is down - regulated in Nogo - A knockout mice that reveal increased neurite growth and an increased regeneration potential when compared to wildtype control mice [ 73 ] . Fifth , in the frontal cortex of schizophrenic patients EFhd2 becomes up - regulated together with microtubule associated proteins [ 24 ] . Whether all these data represent a causative connection of EFhd2 with neurodegenerative diseases on the one hand , with neu - ronal regeneration on the other hand or are merely secondary effects is not known at present . Given the increasing incidence of neurodegenerative diseases , it would potentially be important to examine EFhd2 expression and function in human inflammatory Figure 3 Involvement of EFhd2 in membrane and cytoskeleton associated pathways . EFhd2 can associate with detergent resistant membranes ( DRM ) thought to represent membrane rafts in some B cell lines . Membrane raft association of EFhd2 was also detected in nervous tissue of mice that express a gain of function mutant ( G93A ) of SOD1 . EFhd2 has been shown to exhibit NF - (cid:1) B - activating as well as NF - (cid:1) B - inactivating functions in different cell types . Through regulation of NF - (cid:1) B , EFhd2 may regulate survival or apoptosis of diverse cell types . The interactions of EFhd2 with the SH3 domains of Lyn , PLC g and Fgr are based on GST - Pull down experiments using recombinant SH3 domains ( see Ref . 14 ) . The interactions of Fgr and Lyn SH3 domains with EFhd2 depend on phosphorylation and the SH3 domain of Fgr binds to the predicted proline - rich ( PR ) SH3 domain binding region of EFhd2 . Three phosphorylation sites of EFhd2 are known : S74 , S76 and Y83 . S74 is a cyclin dependent kinase 1 ( Cdk1 ) site . The ability of EFhd2 to bind calcium may regulate its function and its association with the cytoskeleton . EFhd2 also interacts with hyperphosphorylated Tau in a FTDP17 mouse model as well as in FTDP17 and Alzheimer ’ s patients . Dütting et al . Cell Communication and Signaling 2011 , 9 : 2 http : / / www . biosignaling . com / content / 9 / 1 / 2 Page 7 of 14 diseases , including neuroinflammatory processes , and in murine mouse models for these diseases . Involvement of EFhd2 in membrane associated pathways The plasma membrane contains cholesterol and sphin - golipid - enriched microdomains ( detergent resistant membranes , DRM ) that are thought to function in many membrane - associated processes , such as immune recep - tor signaling [ 74 ] . In addition , microdomains control vesicular trafficking , signaling of various receptors other than immune receptors , and cytoskeletal rearrangement [ 75 ] . Microdomains and their associated scaffold pro - teins have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases , such as Parkinson ’ s and Alzheimer ’ s disease [ 76 ] ( see paragraph above ) . EFhd2 was discovered by us through a proteomic analysis of DRM of B cell lines that differ in their apoptotic response to BCR stimulation [ 30 ] . We found that EFhd2 associates with DRM in cell lines which undergo apoptosis after BCR stimulation [ 30 ] and indeed , as mentioned above , EFhd2 augments BCR signaling and BCR - induced apoptosis in one of these cell lines exam - ined [ 14 , 31 ] . It was tempting to speculate that the DRM association of EFhd2 controls these effects . More recently we could actually show that the BCR - induced increase in intracellular calcium concentration is depen - dent on the DRM association of EFhd2 in WEHI231 cells [ 14 ] . However , EFhd2 was not associated with DRM in the murine B cell line CH27 [ 30 ] . We conclude that membrane raft association of EFhd2 is not constitu - tive but regulated , presumably in a cell type - specific manner . Hence , DRM association of EFhd2 , and thereby its function , may be regulated by a specific pathway active in some cell types . There exist two lines of evi - dence for this hypothesis : First , the predicted SH3 - binding region ( aa 70 - 78 ) of EFhd2 , targeting EFhd2 to DRM , binds specifically to the SH3 domain of the tyrosine kinase Fgr [ 14 ] ( Figure 3 ) . In B cells , Fgr is only expressed late in B cell devel - opment [ 77 ] and there is only one study to our knowl - edge that examined DRM association of Fgr [ 78 ] . This study revealed that , in contrast to other Src family kinases , Fgr is not associated with DRM , at least in RAW264 . 7 cells [ 78 ] . Hence , once Fgr is expressed , it could keep EFhd2 out of DRM . The SH3 domain of Lyn that also binds to EFhd2 [ 14 ] could conversely maintain DRM association of EFhd2 ( Figure 3 ) . While Lyn is expressed throughout B cell development , Fgr is expressed in mature primary B cells , mantle zone B cells and during myelomonocytic differentiation , but not in immature primary B cells [ 77 , 79 ] , which might regulate the subcellular localisation and the function of EFhd2 in mature B cells . Interestingly , we observed a phosphory - lation - dependent interaction of EFhd2 with Lyn and Fgr [ 14 ] . Phosphorylation of murine and human EFhd2 at serine residues 74 and 76 [ 80 - 83 ] and , in brain lysates , of tyrosine 83 [ 38 ] , have been described . Lipopolysac - charide stimulation of macrophages does not alter the phosphorylation of EFhd2 significantly [ 83 ] . In our hands , EFhd2 was not phosphorylated on tyrosine before or after BCR engagement as judged by western blotting with the anti - pY mAb PY99 ( D . M . et al . , unpublished data ) . In conclusion , phosphorylation of either serine 74 or 76 , or both , or other sites would appear to mediate bind - ing of EFhd2 to the SH3 domains of Fgr and Lyn . Interest - ingly , S74 and S76 of EFhd2 are Cdk1 ( cyclin dependent kinase 1 ) phosphorylation sites [ 80 ] . Cdk1 is expressed and active during the G2 / S phase of the cell cycle [ 84 ] , that is , in activated B cells , which are present for instance in germinal centers [ 85 ] . Hence , EFhd2 could be modified by phosphorylation to modulate BCR signals in cycling B cells where the BCR induces G1 arrest and apoptosis [ 86 ] , both of which are enhanced by EFhd2 [ 31 ] . Second , EFhd2 is present in DRM of mouse spinal cord , but only when mice over - express a mutant , toxic gain of function form of superoxide dismutase 1 ( SOD1 ) , namely the G93A mutant [ 71 ] . This mutant is responsible for familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , a chronic , progressive neuromuscular disorder [ 72 ] . Inter - actions of DRM with the cytoskeleton have been well documented [ 75 ] . Interestingly , the G93A mutant of SOD1 also induces DRM association of cytoskeletal pro - teins , such as ezrin , clathrin , actin depolymerising factor and Arp2 / 3 [ 71 ] ( Figure 3 ) . In accordance , EFhd2 has been identified in a complex with ezrin [ 55 ] . Under cer - tain yet to be defined circumstances , EFhd2 may target ezrin , clathrin and others to DRM or become targeted to DRM by cytoskeletal proteins . De - phosphorylation of ezrin after BCR - triggering is important to induce DRM association of the BCR at late time points ( more than 15 min ) [ 87 ] . We have also shown that , at least in the mur - ine B cell line WEHI231 , EFhd2 induces constitutive association of the BCR , PLC g 2 and Syk with DRMs [ 14 ] . Taken together , EFhd2 may function as a DRM - cytos - keleton integrator through as yet not well characterized protein - protein or protein - lipid interactions . Proposed function ( s ) of EFhd2 As detailed above , EFhd2 is a cytoskeleton associated adaptor protein involved in immune and normal as well as pathological neuronal functions , and perhaps in cal - cium homeostasis . This may be important for immune cell signaling and signaling pathways within or arising from neurological synapses . In accordance , EFhd2 is regulated under inflammatory conditions in immune and brain cells . Hence , we propose that EFhd2 is a mod - ulator of immune and brain cell function under both basal and inflammatory conditions . Dütting et al . Cell Communication and Signaling 2011 , 9 : 2 http : / / www . biosignaling . com / content / 9 / 1 / 2 Page 8 of 14 EFhd1 Expression of EFhd1 EFhd1 was first described as mitocalcin . It was identified in an attempt to isolate genes involved in neuronal dif - ferentiation in 2Y - 3t cells , a neuronal progenitor cell line established from an adult p53 - deficient mouse cere - bellum [ 88 ] . In 2Y - 3t cells EFhd1 is up - regulated during differentiation . In vivo , EFhd1 is expressed both in cere - bellum and cerebrum [ 16 , 88 ] . Its expression increases postnatally . In adult mice , neurons of cerebellum , cere - brum and hippocampus ( cornu ammonis and dentate gyrus ) reveal efhd1 mRNA , but only low amounts are present in the white matter of cerebellum and cerebrum [ 88 ] . The Purkinje - layer , the internal granule cell layer and the molecular layer , however , do express EFhd1 . In addition , spermatocytes , interstitial cells of adult testis and granulosa cells of the cumulus oophorus ( cumulus cells ) as well as mural granulosa cells in adult ovary exhibit EFhd1 expression [ 16 , 88 ] . EFhd1 is also expressed in IGF - II - deficient murine C2 myoblasts [ 89 ] . There , efhd1 mRNA ceases in the absence of the tran - scriptional co - activator p300 [ 89 ] . Healthy human renal tissue expresses efhd1 mRNA [ 90 ] and in murine kidney the collecting ducts , but not the glomeruli , reveal EFhd1 [ 16 , 88 ] . Interestingly , EFhd1 expression is repressed in renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) [ 90 ] . In contrast , EFhd1 is present in tumour tissues from patients with stage III and IV melanoma and increased expression of EFhd1 is significantly associated with shorter patient survival times [ 91 ] . Whereas EFhd1 has been proposed to exhibit tumour suppressing functions in RCC [ 90 ] , growth pro - moting functions may be associated with other tumours . Concomitantly , uterine fibroids reveal less efhd1 mRNA than normal myometrium [ 92 ] . Under more physiologi - cal conditions EFhd1 becomes up - regulated at term when compared with midgestation [ 93 ] . In contrast , human endometrial cells down - regulate EFhd1 after tro - phoblast co - culture [ 94 ] . Function of EFhd1 in normal and malignant tissue Using an SDS - gel shift assay EFhd1 has been shown to bind calcium [ 88 ] . It associates with the mitochondrial inner membrane [ 16 ] and over - expression results in neurite extension of 2Y - 3t cells . Conversely , down - regula - tion of EFhd1 through siRNA suppresses neurite out - growth and promotes cell death [ 16 ] . Based on these findings Tominaga and co - workers suggested that EFhd1 is involved in neuronal differentiation and operates through control of mitochondrial function [ 16 ] . Whether this proposed function correlates with the calcium bind - ing activity of EFhd1 is not known at present . Mitochon - dria , however , are important reservoirs of calcium . Interestingly , ectopic expression of manganese superoxide dismutase 2 ( SOD2 ) , a mitochondrial enzyme that inactivates superoxide to protect cells from oxidative damage , induces down - regulation of EFhd1 in a pancrea - tic carcinoma cell line . Conversely , reduction of SOD2 abundance causes increased EFhd1 expression in a human pancreatic carcinoma cell line ( MIA - PaCa2 ) [ 95 ] . At first glance it is therefore puzzling that reduction of SOD2 increases neuronal cell death by activating cell death pathways [ 96 , 97 ] . An explanation could be that up - regulation of EFhd1 through reduced SOD2 expression [ 95 ] may be part of an anti - apoptotic mechanism antago - nizing oxidative stress in neuronal cells ( Figure 4 ) . An example of a small calcium binding protein antagonizing oxidative stress is calmodulin : After calcium binding , cal - modulin interacts with antioxidant enzymes involved in ROS homeostasis [ 1 ] . A similar mechanism may apply to EFhd1 in a tissue - specific manner . Sustained activation of the autocrine IGF - II pathway is critical for myoblast viability and differentiation [ 98 ] . Gene expression profiling of IGF - II - deficient myoblasts that undergo apoptosis when incubated in differentia - tion - promoting medium revealed new mediators of CBP / p300 promoted survival . Myoblasts expressing CBP / p300 showed a 17 - fold up - regulation of EFhd1 [ 89 ] . This indicates that EFhd1 might be a factor causing CBP / p300 mediated survival in muscle cells . Interestingly , together with PCAF , the transcriptional co - activator CBP / p300 is a key player in neuronal outgrowth by acety - lating histones and p53 [ 99 ] and exhibits neuroprotective functions [ 100 ] . It is tempting to speculate that CBP / p300 up - regulates EFhd1 also in neuronal tissue to promote neuronal survival . As readily mentioned above , EFhd1 expression has also been described in kidney . This is repressed in renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) when compared to healthy tissue [ 90 ] . The same holds true for the transcription factor HNF4 a ( hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 a ) . This suggests that HNF4 a exhibits tumour suppressing functions [ 101 ] . Interestingly , HNF4 a increases expression of EFhd1 , revealing that efhd1 is a target gene of HNF4 a [ 90 , 102 ] . Very recently , an independent microarray ana - lysis confirmed this initial finding [ 103 ] . Ectopic HNF4 a - expression reduces proliferation in HEK293 cells ( a human embryonic kidney cell line ) and there - fore , the authors postulate a possible tumour suppressor activity of HNF4 a [ 102 ] . However , inducible EFhd1 expression in HEK293 cells revealed that EFhd1 rather augments proliferation slightly [ 102 ] . Therefore , efhd1 is a HNF4 a target gene that appears to oppose the prolif - eration suppressing effect of HNF4 a in HEK293 cells . Additionally , HNF4 a up - regulates hepatocyte iNOS ( inducible nitric oxide synthetase ) in response to the inflammatory redox state [ 104 , 105 ] . iNOS exhibits anti - oxidant and anti - apoptotic functions . Hence , it is likely that HNF4 a senses the inflammatory redox state in Dütting et al . Cell Communication and Signaling 2011 , 9 : 2 http : / / www . biosignaling . com / content / 9 / 1 / 2 Page 9 of 14 tissues where it is expressed . Taken together , the mito - chondrial localization of EFhd1 , its ability to promote differentiation of 2Y - 3t cells and its converse regulation by the redox factors SOD2 and HNF4 a suggest that EFhd1 is part of a redox - sensitive network controlling cell survival and / or differentiation ( Figure 4 ) . Whether EFhd1 is actually a survival promoting or tumour sup - pressing factor may depend on the cell type and envir - onmental context . For example , under pathological conditions , such as hypoxia and ischemia / reperfusion injury , mitochondrial dysfunction results in ROS increase . Normal tissue responds to this challenge with calcium overload , followed by mitochondrial depolariza - tion , cytochrome c release and apoptosis [ 1 ] . Tumours , however , have developed mechanisms to survive hypoxia and ROS increase . One of these factors might be EFhd1 . A combined genome - wide ChIP sequencing analysis with gain - and loss - of - function transcriptome analyses in early - stage B cells identified promoters of genes with Ebf1 ( early B cell factor - 1 ) binding sites . IL - 7 cultured pro - B cells , in which Ebf1 was conditionally inactivated , express less EFhd1 [ 106 ] , suggesting that efhd1 is a tar - get gene of Ebf1 . Hnf4 a was also described as direct tar - get of the transcription factor Ebf1 in common lymphoid progenitors [ 107 ] and common lymphoid pro - genitors are subject to oxidative stress [ 108 ] . Thus , Ebf1 may up - regulate EFhd1 through HNF4 a . These data point to a function of EFhd1 during early B cell devel - opment , an issue we are currently addressing . In contrast to transcriptional activators of efhd1 , Suz12 is a transcriptional repressor as part of the transcriptional repressor complex PRC2 ( polycomb repressor complex ) in murine terato - carcinoma cells [ 109 ] . These complexes are normally highly abundant in embryonic tissues and are essential for development . In adult tissues , expres - sion of Suz12 is very low [ 110 , 111 ] but it is very abun - dant in a variety of human tumours . PRC2 catalyzes trimethylation ( me3 ) of histone 3 lysine 27 ( H3K27 ) , thereby , mediating transcriptional repression . Conse - quently , targeting of the efhd1 promoter by Suz12 should lead to decreased or no expression of EFhd1 . Conclusions Calcium binding proteins of the EF - hand are involved in all aspects of cellular functions . EFhd2 and EFhd1 are two related EF - hand containing adaptor proteins with a similar predicted overall structure . Both proteins bind calcium , but they differ in their sites of expression as well as in their proposed function in different cell types . EFhd2 is a cytoskeleton associated adaptor protein involved in immune and brain cell function and acts likely in response to changes in calcium homeostasis . EFhd1 is involved in neuronal differentiation and operates through control of mitochondrial function . Furthermore EFhd1 could be part of a redox - sensitive network con - trolling cell survival and / or differentiation depending on the cell type and environmental context . Whereas EFhd1 and EFhd2 are almost identical in the C - terminal part Figure 4 Involvement of EFhd1 in survival and redox regulated pathways . EFhd1 has been described as a survival factor for neuronal cells and been proposed to mediate muscle cell survival . In response to oxidative stress that can be blocked by superoxide dismutase 2 ( SOD2 ) , HNF - 4 a ( hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 a ) becomes activated . EFhd1 is a direct target of HNF - 4 a and its expression is repressed by SOD2 . Thus , EFhd1 may be involved in a protective cellular response against oxidative stress and , thereby , exhibit anti - apoptotic functions in diverse cell types . Early B cell factor 1 ( Ebf1 ) positively regulates EFhd1 expression in early B cells whereas Suz12 as part of the polycomb repressor complex 2 ( PRC2 ) is a negative regulator of EFhd1 expression . Dütting et al . Cell Communication and Signaling 2011 , 9 : 2 http : / / www . biosignaling . com / content / 9 / 1 / 2 Page 10 of 14 containing the EF - hands and the coiled - coil domain , a non - homologous moiety between aa 20 - 80 in front of the EF - hands shows the most differences between EFhd2 and EFhd1 , as well as between orthologues of EFhd2 and EFhd1 . As a result , EFhd2 and EFhd1 may bind distinct proteins redundantly while others uniquely , thereby , transmitting alterations in the intracellular calcium con - centration into different signaling outcomes . Hence it appears comprehensible that expression of EFhd2 and EFhd1 is tightly controlled and regulated to ensure effi - cient function of the respective cell type . Besides the compelling necessity to clarify the detailed functions and signaling pathways of EFhd2 and EFhd1 in different cellu - lar contexts , future work has to address possible redun - dancies of EFhd2 and EFhd1 . Therefore , it is reasonable to generate and cross EFhd2 knockout and transgenic mice with the respective Efhd1 mice and analyze the impact in function and development , especially with regard to the immune and nervous system , as well as the progression of tumours .
