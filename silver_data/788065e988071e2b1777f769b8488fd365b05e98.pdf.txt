Identification of Novel Genes Critical for CNS Regeneration in L . stagnalis by Mila Aleksic A thesis submitted in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Master of Science Graduate Department of Physiology University of Toronto Â© Copyright by Mila Aleksic 2011 ii Identification of Novel Genes Critical for CNS Regeneration in L . stagnalis Mila Aleksic Master of Science Department of Physiology University of Toronto 2011 Abstract Neuronal regeneration in the mammalian central nervous system ( CNS ) is severely compromised due to the presence of extrinsic inhibitory signals and a reduced intrinsic regenerative capacity . Understanding the cellular and molecular processes underlying injury and regeneration in the CNS is necessary for the development of effective therapeutic strategies . Lymnaea stagnalis , a freshwater pond snail , has proven to be a powerful model for studying the fundamental mechanisms underlying neurite outgrowth and regeneration . In this study I designed the first custom L . stagnalis microarray gene chip and carried out microarray analysis to profile gene expression changes following CNS injury . From a pool of significantly regulated genes , I provided the first evidence that C / EBP , a transcription factor , plays an integral role in regeneration by maintaining the viability of the distal neurite . We also proposed a novel signaling network and demonstrated that BCL 7 regulates neurite regeneration , an effect that may be mediated through Ca 2 + - dependent growth cone formation . iii Table of Contents Table of Contents . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . iii List of Tables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . vi List of Figures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . vii List of Abbreviations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . viii 1 .

Introduction 1 . 1 General Overview Injuries to the central nervous system ( CNS ) , for example from stroke or spinal cord injury , affect millions of people each year and cause devastating and irreversible losses of function . Over the past 100 years , scientists have been studying CNS regeneration in order to identify methods of aiding the process ( Blesch and Tuszynski , 2009 ) . Whereas CNS axons in adult mammals do not spontaneously regenerate after injury , peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) axons readily regenerate and allow for functional recovery following nerve injury ( Huebner and Strittmatter , 2009 ) . In the last three decades , this fundamental difference between the two systems led to the identification of several mechanisms that limit regeneration and functional recovery in the adult CNS ( Baptiste and Fehlings , 2007 ) , involving both extrinsic as well as intrinsic factors ( Curinga and Smith , 2008 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ) . Although molecular insights into regeneration have been largely gained from vertebrate models , understanding the mechanisms that are involved in regeneration in invertebrate systems has also been very advantageous for biomedicine ( Sanchez and Tsonis , 2006 ) . In contrast to mammals , CNS regeneration is permissive in adult invertebrates . Unravelling the mysteries behind why regeneration and functional recovery occur in some model systems and not in humans can provide new pathways to therapeutically target . This study takes advantage of the regenerative capacity of the invertebrate model L . stagnalis in order to identify genes that are differentially expressed following CNS injury . It identifies functionally known and novel genes that are up - and down - regulated after injury , and that may underlie the intrinsic regenerative ability of adult Lymnaea neurons . It also examines the role of the transcription factor C / EBP on neuron regeneration in vitro . The thesis will conclude by proposing a novel pathway involved in CNS injury and evaluating the mechanisms behind the network . 2 1 . 2 Extrinsic Regulators of Regeneration In the early 1980âs , studies by Aguayo et al . , established clear evidence that some populations of adult CNS neurons possess regenerative capacity when provided with environments such as a peripheral nerve graft ( Aguayo et al . , 1981 ) . This study prompted the idea that the PNS milieu is more conducive for long - distance axon regeneration compared to that of the CNS . Subsequently , differences in the CNS environment including the expression of myelin inhibitory proteins ( an inhibitory extracellular matrix at the injury site ) , alterations in axon guidance molecules and a reduction in growth factor expression were found to contribute to the prevention of regeneration . 1 . 2 . 1 Myelin CNS myelin made by mature oligodendrocytes is a major inhibitor of neurite outgrowth . The CNS contains several myelin derived inhibitors , including Nogo - A , myelin - associated glycoprotein ( MAG ) , and oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ( OMgp ) ( Filbin , 2003 ) . Nogo - A is a member of the reticulon ( RTN ) family of proteins ( Chen et al . , 2000 ) , and is comprised of two inhibitory domains Nogo66 and amino - Nogo ( Fournier et al . , 2001 ) . Blocking Nogo - A with IN - antibody or NEP1 - 40 antagonist peptide , has been reported to enhance corticospinal tract ( CST ) regeneration following spinal cord injury in rats ( Schnell and Schwab , 1990 ; Bregman et al . , 1995 ; Fournier et al . , 2002 ) . MAGs are transmembrane proteins that regulate neurite outgrowth in an age - dependent fashion . The expression of MAG has been shown to promote the growth of embryonic and neonatal neurons , and inhibit outgrowth from more mature neurons ( DeBellard et al . , 1996 ) . The third type of prototypic myelin inhibitors are OMgpâs , a glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) anchored protein expressed by oligodendrocytes in the mature CNS ( Mikol and Stefansson , 1988 ) . Deletion of the OMgp gene resulted in improved functional recovery and sprouting of serotonergic fibres following SCI ( Curinga et al . , 2008 ) . Taken together , these studies demonstrate that deleting or neutralizing myelin derived inhibitors enhances neurite outgrowth . 1 . 2 . 2 Guidance Molecules Within the adult CNS myelin , studies have also revealed the presence of several inhibitory guidance molecules , including members of the semaphorin , ephrin , netrin and Wnt families . These guidance cues are known to regulate neuronal development , however , many CNS neurons 3 continue to express receptors for them into adulthood where they play a different role in regeneration ( Reza et al . , 1999 ) . Semaphorins mainly function as inhibitory guidance cues , such that in vitro application of Sema3A results in growth cone collapse ( Kaneko et al . , 2006 ) , and blocking Sema3A from binding its receptor complex results in enhanced axon regeneration after SCI ( Fabes et al . , 2006 ) . Eph / Ephrin signaling has also been correlated with reduced regeneration ( Fabes et al . , 2006 ) . Ephrins bind to members of the EphA and EphB receptor tyrosine kinase families . While injury results in an increase in ephrin B2 expression , accumulation of the EphA4 receptor in injured neurons and results in retraction of axons , and blocking EphA4 receptors enhances sprouting of CST axons ( Fabes et al . , 2006 ) . In contrast to the other two , Netrin - 1 can act as either a chemoattractant or a chemorepellent depending on the receptor type ( Toullec et al . , 1992 ) . Following SCI , oligodendrocytes express Netrin - 1 and neurons shift their expression to repulsive receptors , suggesting a role for Netrin 1 in inhibiting neuronal outgrowth ( Manitt et al . , 2006 ) . Like the netrin family , the Wnt family also comprises attractive and repulsive cues . Frizzled receptors mediate Wnt - 4 attraction and Ryk receptor tyrosine kinase mediates repulsion of Wnt - 5a during development ( Lyuksyutova et al . , 2003 ) . After dorsal column injury there is an induction of Wnt - 5a and Ryk around the lesion and as a result blocking Ryk promotes sprouting of CST axons ( Liu et al . , 2008 ) . Finally , application of neurotrophins functions to promote regeneration . Successful regeneration in the PNS is known to be accompanied by a rapid increase in such growth factors as NGF , BDNF , and CNTF ( Giger et al . , 2010 ) . In the CNS these neurotrophic factors regulate growth , guidance and survival of neurons but their expression generally decreases during development . By mimicking the PNS environment , studies have shown that applying these growth factors following SCI can promote extensive axonal growth . For example , NGF promoted growth of nociceptive axons ( Tuszynski et al . , 1996 ) , NT - 3 promoted growth of lesioned dorsal column sensory axons ( Taylor et al . , 2006 ) and BDNF promoted growth of diverse groups of axons ( Lu et al . , 2005 ) . Collectively , all of these studies imply that the inability of axons to regenerate can be in part attributed to the actions of molecules that are critical for proper CNS development . 4 1 . 2 . 3 The Glial Scar In addition to the growth inhibitory nature of the CNS milieu , regenerating axons have a further obstacle to overcome . The glial scar that forms within days of the injury is composed of reactive astrocytes , microglia / macrophages , and extracellular matrix molecules ( specifically chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans , CSPGs ) which pose a chemical barrier for axonal regeneration ( Jones et al . , 2003 ) . CSPGâs are a complex group of glycoproteins that are covalently linked to glycosaminoglycan chains ( GAGs ) ( Galtrey and Fawcett , 2007 ) . Following CNS injury CSPGâs are secreted by almost all types of cells , especially astrocytes , and mainly exert an inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth ( McKeon et al . , 1999 ) . By enzymatically degrading the CSPGâs GAG side chains using chondroitinase ABC ( ChABC ) , neurites showed growth potential which resulted in functional improvement following CNS injury ( McKeon et al . , 1995 ; Garcia - Alias et al . , 2009 ) . As described above , following injury the CNS milieu is altered , leading to an extensive change in the expression of numerous molecules , the result of which inhibits axons from regenerating . Although this inhibitory environment constitutes a major barrier for regeneration , its neutralization is insufficient in promoting maximal regeneration . 1 . 3 Intrinsic Regenerative Mechanisms The intrinsic regenerative ability of neurons governs how they will respond to an injury . The regenerative capacity of neurons substantially declines as they mature due to the intrinsic cellular changes that occur following development ( Muramatsu et al . , 2009 ) . During development axon growth is promoted by the surrounding environment and intracellular machinery . Once the axon reaches its target , neuronal function switches from axon growth to synapse formation and maturation ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) . Evidence from RGCs demonstrates a dramatic reduction in axon outgrowth after birth ( Chen et al . , 1995 ) . The developmental decline in axon growth is likely due to interactions between extracellular signals and intrinsic mechanisms . Temporal changes in expression of several molecules including cAMP , mTOR , and KLFs , coincides with the developmental - dependent decline of axon growth in CNS neurons ( Muramatsu et al . , 2009 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , PNS axons in adult mammals have greater regenerative ability then 5 their CNS counterparts . PNS neurons up - regulate several regeneration associated genes following injury . These include transcription factors , c - Jun , ATF - 3 and growth associated protein , GAP - 43 , CAP - 23 ( Huebner and Strittmatter , 2009 ) . The growth of axons following injury is sustained primarily by these cellular changes in gene expression , protein synthesis and cytoskeletal modulation . Therefore , regulation of these molecular mechanisms may be a powerful strategy for enhancing axonal regeneration and functional recovery . 1 . 3 . 1 Gene Expression In the nervous system , changes in gene expression underlie the morphological alterations in cell morphology and function . Consequently , successful axon regeneration requires proper activation of the transcription and translation machinery following injury . Distinct changes in gene expression are observed after injury to the adult CNS , and this is due to their regulation by transcription factors ( Moore and Goldberg , 2011 ) . Transcription factors are DNA - binding proteins that activate or repress the transcription of their target gene . A single transcription factor can bind to multiple locations on the genome and regulate numerous genes and as a result amplify its effects . After CNS injury the up - regulation of transcription factors results in specific gene expression changes ( Moore and Goldberg , 2011 ) . Several transcription factors have already been shown to promote outgrowth of injured CNS neurons . One of the most promising candidates lies in the cAMP - CREB pathway . During neuronal maturation there is an age - dependent decline in the intracellular concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) ( Filbin , 2003 ) . The drop in cAMP levels switches the responsiveness of axons to extracellular cues and coincides with a reduction in the capacity of neurons to regenerate ( Cai et al . , 2001 ; Shewan et al . , 2002 ) . In this cascade , cAMP activates Protein Kinase A ( PKA ) which phosphorylates and activates the cAMP responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) ( Yamashita , 2007 ) . Activation of CREB results in the transcription of several growth promoting genes , including C / EBP , ATF - 3 , Arg - 1 , and plays a key role in enhancing axon growth and regeneration both in the PNS and CNS . For example , in cultured DRG neurons expression of constitutively active CREB is able to overcome the inhibitory effect of MAG on neurite outgrowth , and in rat SCI models CREB activation promotes the growth of dorsal column axons through the lesion site ( Cai et al . , 2002 ; Gao et al . , 2004 ; Spencer and Filbin , 2004 ) . Moreover , pharmacologically increasing cAMP levels by the use of a selective cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor type IV , Rolipram , promotes regeneration and recovery of SCI rats and optic nerve 6 axon regeneration across the CNS glia ( Nikulina et al . , 2004 ) , emphasizing the therapeutic potential of targeting the cAMP - dependent signaling pathways in CNS regeneration . The anaphase promoting complex / cyclosome and its activator Cdh1 ( APC / C Cdh1 ) are also suggested to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of axonal outgrowth . APC / C Cdh1 causes the developmental decline of neurite growth in cerebellar granule cells by targeting inhibitor of DNA binding 2 ( Id2 ) . Id2 is an inhibitory protein that binds other helix - loop - helix ( bHLH ) factors to prevent them from activating transcription ( Iavarone and Lasorella , 2004 ; Konishi et al . , 2004 ) . During development , by binding to bHLH factors , Id2 inhibits the expression of several growth inhibitory molecules and receptors , causing the neuron to be insensitive to extrinsic inhibitory cues and promoting axon growth ( Jackson , 2006 ; Lasorella et al . , 2006 ) . However , in the adult , the APC / C Cdh1 complex induces the proteolysis of Id2 , relieving its inhibitory effect , which triggers the expression of several receptors involved in extrinsic growth - inhibitory signals ( Konishi et al . , 2004 ) . As a consequence , the neuron is rendered more sensitive to negative environmental cues , leading to a reduction in intrinsic growth potential . Aside from the cAMP - CREB signaling pathway and APC / C Cdh1 complex , there are several other factors involved in the transcriptional regulation of neuronal regeneration . For example , the transcription factor c - Jun has been implicated in promoting axon regeneration in several models of nerve injury ( Raivich et al . , 2004 ) . c - Jun regulates the expression of proteins expressed during regeneration such as CD44 , Galanin , and Î±7Î² - 1 integrin . Mice which lack c - Jun displayed a severe defect in the axonal response to injury and target re - innervation ( Herdegen et al . , 1997 ; Raivich et al . , 2004 ) . Similar to c - Jun , activating transcription factor - 3 ( ATF3 ) is also up - regulated in regenerating neurons ( Campbell et al . , 2005 ) . ATF3 and c - Jun actually form a heterodimer and may act synergistically to induce axon outgrowth ( Moore and Goldberg , 2011 ) . The cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) and interleuikin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) also regulate transcriptional systems that enhance axonal growth , with IL - 6 and LIF - null mice displaying impaired peripheral and central nerve regeneration and mice constitutively over - expressing IL - 6 showing enhanced regeneration ( Hirota et al . , 1996 ; Cafferty et al . , 2004 ) . IL - 6 and LIF bind to IL - 6 receptor alpha and gp130 complex which phosphorylates JAK . JAK in turn phosphorylates the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) , which then enters the nucleus to activate transcription ( Taga , 1996 ) . The phosphorylation of STAT3 acts as a positive injury signal that promotes transcription and regeneration . Kruppel - like factors ( KLFs ) 7 are another type of potential regulators of neurite growth , whereby KLF6 and KLF7 were shown to be necessary for RGC re - growth after injury ( Veldman et al . , 2010 ) . These transcription factors as well as many that are yet to be identified play an essential role in enhancing CNS regeneration . Transcription factors control intrinsic processes of regeneration be regulating the expression of growth promoting genes . A better understanding of these regulatory networks can lead to better therapeutic targets for enhancing intrinsic regenerative capacity . 1 . 3 . 2 Protein Synthesis In order to achieve successful regeneration , the injured axon must be able to transform into a growth cone , a dynamic and motile structure at the tip of the axon . The process of growth cone re - formation and axon outgrowth requires local and global protein turnover , new proteins need to be synthesized and old ones degraded ( Gumy et al . , 2010 ) . Axons contain protein synthesis machinery , including ribosomal proteins , translation initiation factors and mRNAs . Local axonal protein synthesis is required for axon outgrowth , and application of protein synthesis inhibitors significantly impairs the growth cone regenerative ability ( Verma et al . , 2005 ) . Consequently , the growth of axons is highly dependent on the synthesis of new proteins and there are several mechanisms that mediate local and global protein synthesis after injury . For example , the cAMP - CREB - Arg1 pathway is an important target for promoting gene translation and axon regeneration . Following cAMP activation , CREB transcriptionally induces the expression of arginase - 1 ( Arg1 ) , which results in polyamine synthesis and promotion of nerve regeneration following an optic nerve crush ( Deng et al . , 2009 ) . Another pathway in protein synthesis - dependent axon regeneration involves a PI3K signaling cascade regulated by a dual phosphatase , phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ) . Receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) activation following injury activates phosphoinositide 3 - kinases ( PI3K ) , which phosphorylates and converts the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) into phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) triphosphate ( PIP 3 ) , resulting in the activation of AKT ( Song et al . , 2005 ) . PTEN antagonizes PI3K and catalyzes the conversion from PIP 3 to PIP 2 , so inactivation of PTEN results in accumulation of PIP 3 and the activation of AKT . There are multiple downstream effectors of PI3K / AKT . The signaling cascade inactivates glycogen synthase kinase - 3Î² ( GSK - 3Î² ) and releases the inhibition on the Mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) , both of which 8 enhance protein translation to promote regeneration ( Zhou et al . , 2004 ; Ma and Blenis , 2009 ) . Specifically , the deletion of PTEN in retinal ganglion cells ( RGC ) increased the cellsâ survival and promoted robust axon regeneration after injury ( Park et al . , 2008 ) . These effects were potentially mediated by the activation of mTOR . mTOR promotes the synthesis of raw materials for axon extension , and the enhancement of axonal transport and cytoskeleton assembly in the axon terminal by signaling molecules such as PI3K and GSK - 3Î² ( Park et al . , 2010 ) . Other signaling molecules such as ERK1 / 2 and PKA were also found to be important for successful regeneration . It is speculated that they are involved in local protein synthesis of growth related axonal mRNA which regulates growth cone formation ( Chierzi et al . , 2005 ) . Alternatively they can act as signal molecules and retrogradely transported to the cell body to achieve global translational changes ( Sung et al . , 2001 ) . This suggests that enhancing protein synthesis is a valuable approach for enhancing regenerative capacity . The rapid change in local protein synthesis following injury requires degradation of existing proteins . Axon outgrowth and regeneration is a dynamic balance between synthesis and degradation of proteins ( Gumy et al . , 2010 ) . Degradation of proteins in the axon occurs through various pathways , including ubiquitin - proteosome system ( UPS ) , calcium - mediated proteolysis and autophagy - mediated degradation . Inhibition of UPS activity has been shown to correlate with growth cone formation and successful regeneration ( Verma et al . , 2005 ) . On the other hand , calcium - dependent calpain proteolysis is required for growth cone development ( Spira et al . , 2001 ) . Autophagy , the degradation of proteins inside lysosomes , may also contribute to axonal homeostasis . However , no direct evidence exists to associate its activity with regeneration ( Cuervo , 2004 ) . Axon regeneration and the formation of a growth cone require protein synthesis and degradation to occur synergistically . This complex network of processes is an important target for promoting regeneration after injury . 1 . 3 . 3 Cytoskeleton and Associated Proteins Axon elongation is due to the assembly of intracellular cytoskeletal machinery involving intrinsic signals in response to extracellular signals . In order for successful regeneration to occur , an injured axon must organize its cytoskeleton and transform into a growth cone . The axonal cytoskeleton is composed of three main elements : neurofilaments , microtubules and actin 9 microfilaments ( Lefcort and Bentley , 1989 ) . The growth cone is a key constituent of the axon outgrowth machinery and microtubules and actin filaments are its main cytoskeletal components . The structure of the growth cone , which is fundamental to its function , can be divided into the peripheral domain , the transition zone and the central domain ( Dent and Gertler , 2003 ) . The peripheral domain consists of long , bundled F - actin filaments that form the finger - like filopodia , as well as a mesh - like network between the filopodia called the lammelipodia ( Schaefer et al . , 2002 ) . The central domain is composed of bundled microtubules which enter the growth cone through the axon shaft . Lastly , between the peripheral and central domains is the transition zone , where actinomyosin contractile structures lie perpendicular to the F - actin bundles ( Schaefer et al . , 2002 ) . During growth cone advancement , polymerization of F - actin occurs and the filopodia and lamellipodia move forward , extending the leading edge ( Suter and Forscher , 2000 ; Lee and Suter , 2008 ) . Microtubules also have a major role in growth cone advancement . Individual microtubules in the peripheral domain act as guidance sensors and explore the environment , whereas microtubules in the central domain grow into the newly protruding peripheral zone and consolidate the growth cone neck to form a new axon shaft , resulting in axon outgrowth ( Gordon - Weeks , 1991 ; Gordon - Weeks , 2004 ) . The growth of a microtubule is due to the association of its component Î± and Î² tubulin monomers , and the development of its polarized structure with a âplusâ and a âminusâ end . In the axon , the plus end is oriented towards the growth cone where constant polymerization and depolymerization of the monomers occurs ( Baas , 1997 ; Buck and Zheng , 2002 ) . This dynamic instability of microtubules enables them to very rapidly switch from elongation to retraction ( Baas , 1997 ) . Microtubule dynamics during outgrowth are tightly regulated by post - translational modifications as well as interactions with other growth cone proteins ( Gelfand and Bershadsky , 1991 ; Buck and Zheng , 2002 ) . Support for a role of cytoskeletal and growth cone associated proteins in promoting axon regeneration has been demonstrated in several studies . For example , GSK - 3Î² inhibits microtubule assembly by phosphorylating and inactivating collapsin response mediator protein 2 ( CRMP - 2 ) , adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) and microtubule binding protein 1B ( MAP1B ) ( Zhou et al . , 2004 ; Brown et al . , 2004 ; Trivedi et al . , 2005 ) . CRMP - 2 is a microtubule - binding protein that promotes microtubule polymerization and stabilization resulting in neurite elongation . During CNS development , the active form of CRMP - 2 is able to counteract the inhibitory effects of GSK - 3Î² ( Yoshimura et al . , 2005 ) . However , in the adult there is increased 10 expression of inactive CRMP - 2 in neurons , which inhibits regeneration ( Akira et al . , 1990 ) . APC , which binds to microtubules to regulate their dynamics in neurons , is also inactivated by GSK - 3Î² resulting in the inhibition of neurite elongation ( Zhou et al . , 2004 ) . On the other hand , MAP1B phosphorylation by GSK - 3Î² results in its activation . MAP1B influences microtubule dynamics by controlling microtubule stability , such that its phosphorylation results in an increase in the number of unstable microtubules , leading to a reduction in axon growth ( Trivedi et al . , 2005 ) . Consequently , treatment with a GSK - 3Î² inhibitor promotes axon regeneration , and this is most likely mediated by its effects on CRMP - 2 , APC and MAP1B ( Dill et al . , 2008 ) . cAMP signaling also promotes regeneration by regulating cytoskeletal dynamics . cAMP activates PKA , which inactivates the Rho family of small GTPases . Through a CRMP - 2 dependent mechanism , Rho A kinases become negative regulators of actin and tubulin polymerization such that their inhibition causes axon regeneration in injured spinal cords ( Akira et al . , 1990 ; Mueller et al . , 2005 ) . The intrinsic regenerative capacity of neurons has also been enhanced by overexpressing cytoskeletal associated growth cone proteins GAP - 43 and CAP - 23 in double transgenic mice ( Bomze et al . , 2001 ) . Furthermore , axotomized transgenic Purkinje cells from transgenic mice overexpressing GAP - 43 , exhibit profuse sprouting ( Buffo et al . , 1997 ) . GAP - 43 or CAP - 23 alone can enhance the propensity to initiate axon extension . Both proteins are required , however , to elicit the extension of very long axons ( Bomze et al . , 2001 ) . Adult CNS neurons posses an intrinsic capacity to evoke mechanisms that enhance regeneration after CNS injury ( Muramatsu et al . , 2009 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ) . Neonatal CNS neurons and PNS neurons activate signaling cascades which promote regeneration ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) . However , adult CNS neurons need to initiate proper transcriptional regulation , cytoskeletal organization , and protein synthesis in order to regenerate . Current research has revealed numerous molecules that regulate intrinsic mechanisms for axonal outgrowth . Understanding the global picture of these molecular interactions and signaling networks will greatly contribute to the development and identification of new therapies for CNS injury . 11 1 . 4 Invertebrates in Nerve Regeneration In contrast to the adult mammalian CNS , some invertebrates are capable of spontaneous CNS regeneration following injury . Thus they are an important model to aid our understanding of factors which may promote regeneration in the mammalian CNS . Invertebrate models have successfully contributed the advancement of neuroscience . Major scientific discoveries on synaptic transmission , axonal conductance , and integrative neurobiology can be attributed to these remarkable animals . The advantage of this model organism for investigating the nervous system includes their large - sized neurons , simple nervous system , and well - defined behaviors ( Otsuka et al . , 1966 ; Kandel and Schwartz , 1982 ; Davis , 2005 ) . The first evidence for the existence of local protein synthesis , an essential component of regeneration , came from studies in the squid giant axon ( Giuditta et al . , 1991 ) . Furthermore , the identification of several hundred mRNAs for ribosomal proteins , cytoskeletal proteins , translation factors , was carried out in invertebrate axons ( Giuditta et al . , 1991 ; Gumy et al . , 2010 ) . In 1971 , J Nicholls and DA Baylor investigated the large neurons of the leech and demonstrated regeneration of specific neuronal connections ( Baylor and Nicholls , 1971 ) . Crushing all of the axons in a segment of the CNS disconnected the anterior and posterior parts of the body compromising the rhythmical swimming movement . However , after a few weeks regeneration occurred and axons that re - grew made connections with appropriate targets and the leech regained normal swimming function ( Baylor and Nicholls , 1971 ; Chiquet and Nicholls , 1987 ) . By examining regeneration of axons in the leech CNS , it was shown for the first time that microglia play a key part in the regenerative process and that nitric oxide is crucial for their directed migration , an effect that is mediated by a soluble guanylate cyclase ( Glade - McCulloh et al . , 1989 ; Duan et al . , 2003 ) . Insights into CNS regeneration have also emerged from other invertebrate models . Aplysia have the ability to transform the cut axonal end into a growth cone ( GC ) , a critical event in the cascade leading to regeneration ( Ashery et al . , 1996 ; Sahly et al . , 2006 ) . Using cultured Aplysia neurons as a model system , it was revealed that the magnitudes of the [ Ca 2 + ] i gradients at the site of injury determine whether or not the cut axonal end transforms into a competent GC ( Kamber et al . , 2009 ) . Imaging in Aplysia neurons also revealed that axotomy resulted in reorientation of microtubule polarity , a critical step for growth cone formation ( Erez et al . , 2007 ) . Planarians for example are capable of profound regenerative ability and can regenerate an entire CNS ( Agata et al . , 2007 ; Agata and Umesono , 2008 ) . This phenomenon is dependent on a population of self - 12 renewing adult stem cells called neoblasts ( Salo and Baguna , 1984 ) . Analysis of regeneration in planarians offers a paradigm for understanding how these stem cells are regulated and integrated into the pre - existing CNS and have provided valuable insights for the safe use of stem cells to improve the regenerative capacity in the mammalian nervous system ( Cebria , 2007 ; Aboobaker , 2011 ) . More recently , the nematode C . elegans revealed its potential for discovering new regulators of axon re - growth with the discovery of the central role of the DLK - kinase pathway in axon regeneration ( Hammarlund et al . , 2009 ; Yan et al . , 2009 ) . Time - lapse imaging revealed that DLK - 1 mutants fail to form a growth cone , and the over - expression of DLK - 1 increases growth cone formation and axon regeneration . However DLK - 1 is not required for CNS development and axon growth appears normal in DLK - 1 mutants ( Hammarlund et al . , 2009 ; Yan et al . , 2009 ) . This demonstrates that different pathways can regulate axon development and regeneration . The comparative study of invertebrate nerve regeneration has long been recognized for its potential to provide insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of CNS regeneration . The robust spontaneous regenerative ability in the CNS after injury makes invertebrates excellent models to study cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying axon regeneration ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) . Consequently , invertebrate models of regeneration will continue to play a major role in neuroscience . 1 . 5 Lymnaea stagnalis : a Model for Regeneration Lymnaea stagnalis is an example of an invertebrate model system that exhibits successful regeneration and restoration of function in the adult CNS ( Janse et al . , 1979 ; Hermann et al . , 2000 ; Hermann et al . , 2005 ) . It represents an advantageous preparation in which to analyze in detail the mechanisms by which damaged neurons grow and reform connections with target cells . L . stagnalis has a simplified nervous system made up of a small number of neurons with large identifiable neuronal somata . These characteristics have enabled researchers to determine the functional elements of the Lymnaea neuronal circuitry . Several neural circuits have been identified in terms of the connections between sensory cells , interneurons and motor cells ( Syed et al . , 1990 ; Syed et al . , 1992a ; Magoski et al . , 1994 ) . These identified adult Lymnaea neurons can be isolated individually and maintained in culture , allowing for axonal outgrowth and functional 13 synapse formation between appropriate synaptic partners ( Syed et al . , 1992b ; Feng et al . , 1997 ) . In addition , the neurons of L . stagnalis have very large growth cones that can be transected in culture and electrophysiological recordings can be conducted from both the soma and the growth cone allowing for functional analysis of regeneration ( van Kesteren et al . , 2006 ; Hui and Feng , 2008 ) . Lastly , L . stagnalis neural genes include homologues of well - known transcription factors , genes involved in neurotransmission , axon guidance and signaling pathways ( Feng et al . , 1997 ; Hermann et al . , 2000 ; van Kesteren et al . , 2006 ; Feng et al . , 2009 ) . Numerous groups have taken advantage of this model system and tested the roles of neurotrophins , transmitters and chemoattractants on neurite outgrowth and regeneration ( Ridgway et al . , 1991 ; Spencer et al . , 1998 ; Koert et al . , 2001 ; Wildering et al . , 2001 ) . Koert et al . , studied the regenerative properties of two electrically coupled neurons , the serotonergic cerebral giant cells ( CGCs ) of the Lymnaea ( Koert et al . , 2001 ) . The study suggested that auto - released serotonin is inhibitory to CGC neurite outgrowth in vitro . During regeneration in vivo serotonin release might fine - tune axon guidance and branching by inducing local collapse responses in extending neurites ( Koert et al . , 2001 ) . Adult Lymnaea neurons provided the first evidence for the existence of both atRA and 9 - cis - RA isomers in the CNS of an invertebrate species . Additionally the Lymnaea model offered important evidence for a physiological role for 9 - cis - RA in neuronal chemoattraction and regeneration through a novel mechanism requiring de novo local protein synthesis ( Dmetrichuk et al . , 2006 ; Farrar et al . , 2009 ; Carter et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , Carter et al . , cloned a retinoid receptor from the Lymnaea ( Lym RXR ) , and demonstrated that it is present in the developing embryoand in the cytoplasm of adult CNS neurons , with a strong localization to the neurite . Using regenerating cultured motor neurons , they also showed that Lym RXR is present in the growth cones and that application of a RXR pan - agonist produces growth cone turning in isolated neurites , in the absence of the cell body and nucleus , suggesting a novel , non - genomic role for RXR in growth cone steering ( Carter et al . , 2010 ) . These studies directly contribute to our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the events of axon retraction , regeneration , identification of appropriate target and reformation of functional connections after injury . Consequently , L . stagnalis is an important simple model organism for the study of complex biological processes . One main limitation of using L . stagnalis in genetic functional studies of neuronal regeneration has been a lack of large - scale screening tools , such as microarray analysis . To circumvent this 14 limitation , we recently sequenced more than 10 , 000 ESTs ( expression sequence tags ) from the CNS transcriptome of L . stagnalis ( Feng et al . , 2009 ) and established the largest neuronal EST database in Lymnaea ( www . lymnaea . org ) . In combination with the availability of microarray technology , these gene sequences provide us with the opportunity to perform a high - throughput screening for altered gene expression levels following nerve injury in the L . stagnalis . The identification of genes regulated after CNS injury enables us to identify novel genes involved in regeneration as well as a new role in regeneration for genes with a known function . This will aid in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that promote CNS regeneration and support the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of spinal cord injuries . 1 . 6 Gene Expression Profiling with Microarrays Microarray based expression profiling is a common and valuable tool for performing large - scale screening studies ( Murphy , 2002 ) . While other techniques ( qPCR , Western blotting ) are slow , laborious and allow only a few genes to be investigated at a time , microarrays allow for profiling of thousands of genes simultaneously and are therefore an effective tool for large scale gene expression experiments . 1 . 6 . 1 . Microarray Technology A microarray consists of thousands of spots of oligonucleotides of a specific sequence ( probe ) , used to hybridize a cDNA sample . Probes are attached by covalent bonds to a chemical matrix gene chip . Hybridization of the two strands relies on hydrogen bonding between complementary nucleic acid sequences . When performing a microarray experiment , typically either a one - colour or two - colour microarray approach is used . A one - colour platform involves the hybridization of a single sample to each microarray after it has been labeled with a single fluorophore . In a two - colour procedure two samples ( experimental , control ) are labeled with two different fluorophores and hybridized onto the same array ( Ahmed , 2006a ; Ahmed , 2006b ) . There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches . In the two - colour design hybridization of two samples onto the same array is performed to reduce variability by allowing for a direct comparison . However , dye specific 15 biases can affect the results and many technical replicates need to be performed to enhance accuracy , which substantially adds to cost . The main advantage of using a one - colour platform is that it is simple and allows for more flexibility ( Ahmed , 2006a ; Ahmed , 2006b ) . The approach allows both a comparison across microarrays and between groups of samples . Similarly , the variability between microarrays can be reduced by performing sufficient technical and biological replicates ( Shi et al . , 2008 ) . Both approaches have similar shortcomings , including poor reproducibility and specificity , and studies have shown that data generated from both one - colour and two - color platforms are approximately equivalent ( Patterson et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , the decision to perform a one - colour or two - colour approach is based on the individual experiment , cost and personal preference . We designed a custom L . stagnalis 15k gene expression array to study CNS transcriptome changes following CNS injury . Our gene chip consisted of eight individual arrays each with 15 000 spots . For our experiment we chose a one - color array so that we could have more flexibility with our analysis and be able to use the data for future studies . 1 . 6 . 2 . Applications of Microarrays in Regeneration The CNS is an extremely complex system which makes analysis of transcriptome events following neural injury difficult . The use of microarrays allows for elucidating global changes in gene expression after CNS injury and provides insight into this complex biological network ( Munro and Perreau , 2009 ) . Microarray technology has already led to significant advancements in understanding the molecular cascades following brain and spinal cord injury ( Marciano et al . , 2002 ; Dash et al . , 2004 ) . A study by Aimone et al . examined gene expression changes following rat spinal cord injury at the epicenter as well as both rostral and caudal to the lesion site for up to 45 days after contusion . This elaborate and complex experiment demonstrated the temporal and spatial complexity of gene expression changes that occur after spinal cord injury . It also identified affected regulatory pathways in multiple systems , including inflammation , complement cascade , vasculature and angiogenesis , cholesterol biosynthesis , cell death , calcium signaling , and synaptic plasticity ( Aimone et al . , 2004 ) . A subsequent study by De Biase et al . , examined the gene expression over time ( 4 hrs , 24 hrs , 7 days ) at the impact site , as well as rostral and caudal regions , following mild , moderate , or severe SCI in rats ( De et al . , 2005 ) . It 16 showed that gene expression responses following mild injury were relatively rapid ( 4 hrs and 24 hrs ) , whereas they were delayed and prolonged after more severe injuries . In addition , the number and magnitude of gene expression changes were greatest at the injury site after moderate injury and increased in rostral and caudal regions as a function of injury severity ( De et al . , 2005 ) . The ultimate goal of neuronal regeneration research is to lead to functional recovery . Microarray technology is currently being applied to various models of nerve regeneration , including in vitro models of neurite outgrowth and in vivo models of peripheral nerve injury permissive to regeneration ( Bosse et al . , 2006 ; Szpara et al . , 2007 ; Stam et al . , 2007 ) . For example , Szpara et al . , assessed the transcriptional activity in embryonic superior cervical ganglia ( SCG ) and dorsal root ganglia ( DRG ) during a time course of neurite outgrowth in vitro ( Szpara et al . , 2007 ) . They found that despite its potent effects as an inhibitory extrinsic cue Sema3A does not appear to significantly affect the intrinsic transcriptional activities involved in neurite outgrowth . Thus , the robust effects of semaphorin signaling at sites of injury and regeneration are mediated locally and not via transcriptional changes in the soma ( Szpara et al . , 2007 ) . On the other hand Stam et al . , utilized the differential response of DRG neurons following lesion of their peripheral neurite vs the central neurite in order to gain insight in the early transcriptional events associated with successful regeneration ( Stam et al . , 2007 ) . They showed that peripheral and central nerve crushes elicit very distinct transcriptional activation and identified Ankrd1 , a gene known to act as a transcriptional modulator to be involved in neurite outgrowth ( Stam et al . , 2007 ) . Comparison of conserved gene expression changes in regenerating and non - regenerating animals can also help elucidate genes involved in this response . As such animals that exhibit successful regeneration such as the immature opossum , salamanders as well as invertebrate models including the leech , planarians and snails have been used to identify the mechanisms that underlie CNS regeneration ( Baylor and Nicholls , 1971 ; Lane et al . , 2007 ; Monaghan et al . , 2007 ) . For example , Monaghan et al . designed a custom gene chip to examine gene expression changes following tail SCI in the salamander . They identified numerous genes that were similarly up - regulated in the both mammals and salamanders , including hemoxygenase - 1 , APOE , and genes involved in the immune response . On the other hand several genes were differentially regulated between these two models ( Monaghan et al . , 2007 ) . A microarray study of gene expression changes in planarian regeneration also revealed genes with similar regulation as mammals , for 17 example N - CAM , and a G - protein subunit , as well as differentially regulated genes ( Cebria et al . , 2002 ) , emphasizing the complexity of the regenerative process and the necessity for more gene expression studies in other regenerative models . The use of these and other regenerative models for transcriptome analysis has been limited until now due to the availability of species specific microarrays . However , with the recent advancements in genome wide sequencing , further studies of regenerative mechanisms can be undertaken . 1 . 7 RNA interference : A Tool to Identify Molecular Mechanisms Only over a decade old , RNA interference ( RNAi ) is a revolutionary technique for manipulating gene expression in invertebrates and vertebrates based on a highly - conserved cellular pathway . RNAi was first described in an invertebrate model by Fire and Mello ( Fire et al . , 1998 ) . They found that injecting long dsRNA into C . elegans resulted in degradation of the corresponding homologous mRNA in both the somatic cells as well as the F1 progeny . RNAi is also related to other gene - silencing phenomena , including posttranscriptional gene silencing in plants . A form of PTGS in response to transgene sequences was first documented in petunias , when introduction of a transgene resulted in plants with white instead of purple flowers ( Napoli et al . , 1990 ) . This phenomenon was termed ' co - suppressionâ because the expression of both the introduced transgenes and the homologous endogenous genes were coordinately suppressed . A similar phenomenon was reported in the fungus N . crassa , a silencing mechanism known as âquellingâ ( Romano and Macino , 1992 ) . Although these processes at first seemed unrelated , they all use dsRNA homologous to the silenced gene . In addition , key proteins involved in RNAi are highly conserved across different organisms ( Cogoni and Macino , 2000 ) . However , interest in RNAi rapidly escalated when Tuschl and colleagues demonstrated that RNAi also occurs in mammalian cells ( Elbashir et al . , 2001 ) . Since then , the basic processes involved in RNAi have been determined in detail . The RNAi response is initiated by the enzyme Dicer , an RNAase III ribonuclease , which cleaves long dsRNA into double stranded siRNA about 20 - 25 nt long ( Bernstein et al . , 2001 ) . The siRNA is then incorporated into the RNA - induced silencing complex ( RISC ) where the sense strand is cleaved by the nuclease Argonaute - 2 ( Ago2 ) protein . This results in separation of the two strands , and the RISC complex with the remaining antisense strand searches for complementary mRNA that is subsequently cleaved by Ago - 2 ( Sioud , 2011 ) . 18 RNAi effects mediated by dsRNA have been demonstrated in a number of organisms including plants , protozoa , nematodes , and insects ( Cogoni and Macino , 2000 ) . Unlike invertebrates , long dsRNA was found to potently activate an immune response in mammals ( Judge et al . , 2005 ; Kleinman et al . , 2008 ) . The long dsRNA is interpreted by the cells as a pathogen and initiates a nonspecific interferon ( INF ) response similar to a viral infection . Protein kinase R , a cytoplasmic dsRNA interactive protein binds to the dsRNA and regulates IFN - Î± and Î² and terminates protein synthesis ( Clemens and Elia , 1997 ) . In addition , enzymes are induced which produce 2â² - 5â² - linked oligoadenylates and thereby cause unspecific degradation of single - stranded RNA ( Player and Torrence , 1998 ) . However the INF response is only triggered by dsRNAs which are longer than 30 nucleotides , chemically synthesized short double stranded RNAs ( siRNAs ) , can induce gene silencing without activating this immune response ( Manche et al . , 1992 ; Elbashir et al . , 2001 ) . The advantage of using an invertebrate model is that the genes that constitute the IFN response are absent from the known invertebrate genomes . As a result the invertebrates lack the ability to mount antiviral responses when dsRNA is applied , allowing the researcher to use various RNAi techniques . Despite the vast potential of this technique it is not equivalent to modifying a gene by mutation . RNAi acts to decrease mRNA levels and thus can result in incomplete suppression of gene expression ( Sigoillot and King , 2011 ) . In addition RNAi can potentially induce non - specific effects . Off - target effects are due to silencing of non - target mRNA molecules that have a high degree of homology with the target sequence ( Jackson et al . , 2003 ) . Off - target effects are also induced through the activation of the immune response . Further undesirable side effects are due to the ability of siRNA to act as micro RNA ( miRNA ) . In this way siRNAs can interact with the 3â² - UTR of mRNAs by partial homology and can inhibit their translation ( Saxena et al . , 2003 ) . However , the unspecific effects can be minimized with proper RNAi design . Long dsRNA or commercial siRNA can be either injected into animals , delivered via bacteria , expressed as transgenes or delivered into cultured cells by transfection or bathing ( Perrimon et al . , 2010 ) . RNAi is an invaluable tool for addressing fundamental questions in the biology of living organisms . Most organisms possess the cellular machinery for RNAi and , consequently this approach makes loss - of - function studies possible in organisms where genetic tools do not exist . RNAi has served as a powerful molecular tool to study gene function and provided novel strategies to treat a variety of diseases . Neurodegenerative diseases represent one of the preferred 19 targets for the development of therapeutic RNAi ( Boudreau and Davidson , 2010 ) . For example Huntingtonâs disease , spinocerebellar ataxia , Alzheimerâs are all being heavily studied and there are promising results from RNAi therapy ( Gonzalez - Alegre , 2007 ) . In addition RNAi is also used in regeneration studies in order to isolate the elements involved in regeneration . In the L . stagnalis both dsRNA and siRNA have been used to successfully reduce targeted mRNA levels , either by injecting it into the ganglia or applying it into the culture bath solution ( Wagatsuma et al . , 2006 ; Hui and Feng , 2008 ) . 1 . 8 Assessment of Real - Time qPCR for Gene Expression Analysis Quantitative real - time PCR ( qPCR ) is a valuable tool for quantifying gene expression levels . In qPCR , the amount of PCR product is determined after each cycle of amplification using a fluorescent indicator ( e . g . SybrGreen ) or probe ( e . g . TaqMan ) . The change in fluorescent signal is directly proportional to the number of PCR products , from which the absolute or relative amount of mRNA can be quantified ( Mackay et al . , 2002 ) . Currently there are two predominant methods for qPCR analysis , the comparative Ct ( ÎÎCt ) and the efficiency - correction ( standard curve ) method ( Livak and Schmittgen , 2001 ; Pfaffl , 2001 ) . Both techniques normalize the target gene expression to a control gene , whose expression does not change after treatment . The expression levels are normalized and compared between samples . Both methods require the determination of the efficiency for each gene in addition to the sample - by - sample quantification . The ÎÎCt method further requires that the efficiencies be identical between target and control genes ( Livak and Schmittgen , 2001 ; Pfaffl , 2001 ) . Recently , there has been a rise in the use of qPCR for gene expression quantification , partly due to validation of large - scale screening experiments such as microarrays , which have also become increasing popular ( Canales et al . , 2006 ; VanGuilder et al . , 2008 ) . Due to demand for more rapid qPCR analysis techniques our lab has recently developed a new approach using Ct - Ct plots for analysis of qPCR data ( Hui et al . , 2009 ) . Ct is the PCR cycle at which the amplification process crosses a user - defined detection threshold ( T ) within the early exponential phase of the amplification process . This value of Ct is an indirect measure of the quantity of mRNA . In order to minimize variability and cost we construct mini - standard curves using dilution varying replicates . This way dilution - varying replicates measure both Ct value and efficiency thereby minimizing extraneous variation . The Ct values for test and control genes can then be plotted 20 against each other and fit with the constraint of identical slopes . The intercepts from these fits are then estimates of the differences in relative expression of two genes between samples . Specifically , a downward - shift in the plot reflects an increase in relative expression and an upward - shift reflects a decrease . This new method is simple and has proven to be reliable ( Hui et al . , 2009 ) . We took advantage of this rapid and cost - effective technique for qPCR analysis to validate the data from a microarray experiment and confirm the mRNA expression levels of several identified genes . 1 . 9 Hypotheses 1 . 9 . 1 . 1 Rational I Neuronal regeneration in the adult mammalian central nervous system is severely compromised due to the presence of extrinsic inhibitory signals and a reduced intrinsic regenerative capacity . In contrast , the CNS of adult L . stagnalis is capable of spontaneous regeneration following neuronal injury . Thus , L . stagnalis has served as an animal model to study the cellular mechanisms involved in neuronal regeneration . Transcriptional regulation is a critical component of intrinsic regenerative mechanisms that promote CNS regeneration in invertebrate and vertebrate organisms . We have recently conducted microarray analysis following CNS injury in the L . stagnalis and identified the transcription factor C / EBP to be up - regulated after injury . 1 . 9 . 1 . 2 Hypothesis I The transcription factor CCAAT enhancer binding protein ( C / EBP ) is important for proper axon regeneration following injury in the L . stagnalis . 1 . 9 . 1 . 3 Specific Aim I 1 ) Perform a high throughput screening for altered gene expression levels following nerve injury in the L . stagnalis 1A ) Develop a custom L . stagnalis 15 k microarray gene chip 1B ) Identify differentially regulated genes following CNS injury using the custom microarray 21 2 ) Characterize the role of C / EBP on neurite regeneration following microarray analysis of the L . stagnalis CNS injury model 2A ) Confirm the gene expression level of C / EBP following CNS injury using qPCR 2B ) Determine if C / EBP mRNA expression is regulated in a time - dependent manner 2C ) Following axotomy of cultured neurons in vitro use RNAi to knockdown C / EBP mRNA to test if it plays a role in regeneration 1 . 9 . 2 . 1 Rational II Through a microarray analysis , we previously identified 67 genes / ESTâs that were significantly regulated following CNS injury in the L . stagnalis . Neuronal regeneration following trauma to the CNS is a complex process regulated by multiple proteins , thus , molecular pathways that underlie regeneration are promising targets for the treatment of CNS injury . We have employed a novel proteomic approach to further analyze the microarray data and identified a new CaM - signaling pathway in the L . stagnalis . We will apply an RNAi approach to test the role of two proteins , BCL 7 and protein phosphatase 1k , identified in the novel signaling network on regeneration in the L . staganlis . 1 . 9 . 2 . 2 Hypothesis II BCL 7 and protein phosphatase 1k enhance regeneration in the Lymnaea CNS . 1 . 9 . 2 . 3 Specific Aim II 1 ) Use bioinformatics to identify a novel signaling cascade during CNS injury . 1A ) Translate identified L . stagnalis genes and identify their mammalian orthologues 1B ) Input the newly derived list into PPI - software in order to determine if a novel signaling cascade exists . 2 ) Determine whether BCL 7 and protein phosphatase 1k , genes identified in the PPI interaction network , are indeed part of the regenerative signaling response in the L . stagnalis . 22 2A ) Examine the time dependent regulation of BCL 7 and protein phosphatase 1k after CNS injury 2B ) Following axotomy of cultured neurons in vitro use RNAi to knockdown BCL 7 and protein phosphatase 1k mRNA levels and test if they play a role in regeneration 3B ) Use live - cell imaging to study the rate of distal and proximal neurite elongation after axotomy in BCL 7 knockdown cells 4B ) Examine the effects of BCL 7 knockdown on calcium levels following axotomy . 23 2 . General Materials and Methods 2 . 1 Animals Fresh water pond snails , L . stagnalis , were obtained from culture at the Free University , Amsterdam , and maintained in the laboratory under standard conditions , at the University of Toronto ( Hui et al . , 2007 ; Fei et al . , 2007 ) . All animals used were kept in water at 20 Â°C under a 12 h light : dark cycle , and fed green leaf lettuce twice a week . Two - month old animals having a shell length of ~ 20mm were used for the experiment 2 . 2 Surgical procedures and in vivo nerve injury Animals were anesthetized by injecting 0 . 5 - 1 ml of 60 mM MgCl 2 into the foot of the snail . Dissections were performed in sterile snail saline containing ( in mM ) : NaCl , 51 . 3 ; KCl , 1 . 7 ; CaCl 2 , 4 . 1 ; MgCl 2 , 1 . 5 ( pH was adjusted to 7 . 9 with 1 mM HEPES / NaOH ) a small incision was made in the dorsal head region and pinned open , exposing the cerebral and buccal ganglia . The right parietal ( RPa ) and right cerebral nerves ( RCe ) were crushed using forceps ( Koert et al . , 2001 ) . Sham animals were operated in the same way as the experimental groups , except that the RPa and RCe connections were not crushed . Following the operation , both the sham - operated and crush - operated animals were maintained under standard laboratory conditions as described above . For studying early gene expression changes ( microarray , qPCR ) , operated animals were kept for 1 hr , 3 hrs and 5 hrs under standard conditions . For the long term functional study of recovery , animals were kept for 10 days under standard conditions and fed green leaf lettuce twice a week . 2 . 3 RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis Snails were anesthetized with 10 % ( v / v ) Listerine ( Listerine ) for 10 min , following which the central ring ganglia and the buccal ganglia were dissected out for total RNA extraction at 1 hr , 3 hrs or 5 hrs post - injury . TRIzol was used to extract total RNA ( Invitrogen , USA ) . Specifically , 100 Î¼l of Trizol was used per two excised ganglia and the final pellet was resuspended in 10 Î¼l of RNase free water . RNA quality was checked on an agarose gel prior to cDNA synthesis and RNA concentration was measured using spectrophotometry . First strand synthesis of cDNA was 24 conducted using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen , USA ) with random hexamer primer ( Fermentas , USA ) in a reaction volume of 20 Î¼l for 1 Î¼g of total RNA . 2 . 4 cDNA Microarray The L . stagnalis microarray was designed based on the L . stagnalis CNS EST database ( http : / / www . Lymnaea . org / ) . The 15K gene chip was made by Agilent Technologies ( U . S . A ) . Briefly , the array contained a total of 15 , 000 spots , 10 , 333 probes were from unique EST / nucleotides and 4 , 425 probes included different sequences from the duplicate genes , and 50 technical replicates with 9 replicates per probe . The hybridization was performed by the University Health Network Microarray Centre ( Toronto , Canada ) . One - Color Microarray - based Gene Expression Analysis ( Agilent technologies ) with cyanine 3 - labeled targets was used to measure gene expression in experimental and control samples . For the microarray , 2 ganglia were collected per group ; there were 8 groups in total : 4 sham - operated and 4 crush - operated . Briefly , 500 Î¼g of total RNA was amplified using a Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit ( Agilent Technologies ) , labeled with Cy3 - CTP and hybridized to the L . stagnalis cDNA microarray at 65Â°C for 17 hours . The images were scanned using a Genepix 4000B microarray scanner ( Axon Instruments , Foster City , CA , USA ) . Image analysis , spot quality control and normalization were performed using Feature Extraction software 9 . 5 . 3 from Agilent Technologies . The intensity files were loaded into GeneSpring GX 10 . 0 . 2 software ( Agilent Technologies ) , a 75th percentile signal value was used to normalize Agilent one - color microarray signals for comparisons between arrays . The signals were log 2 transformed , and the median of the replicated probes was obtained . An unpaired t - test was performed and p < 0 . 05 was used as a cutoff ; from these results we used a 2 . 0 - fold change in signal intensity as a cutoff line to consider the differential expression of a gene as significant . 2 . 5 Real - time quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) qPCR was performed using 5 Î¼l of SYBR GreenER Reagent System ( Invitrogen ) , added to 1 Î¼l of the appropriate primer set ( Table 1 ) , and a diluted sample of cDNA that was topped off with DEPC water to a final volume of 10 Î¼l . For qPCR , 5 new groups of crush - operated and 5 new groups of sham - operated snails were used , each group contained RNA from two ganglia . For the qPCR validation and time - course a new set of RNA samples from sham and crush - operated snails was used . Glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) has been used as a 25 common control gene for spinal cord injury models ( De et al . , 2005 ; Lacroix - Fralish et al . , 2006 ) . The expression of GAPDH was unchanged following CNS injury in the L . stagnalis , therefore , it was an internal control . The cycling parameters were : 95Â°C / 5 min , 40 cycles of 95Â°C / 0 . 5 min , 55Â°C / 1 min , followed by a melting curve protocol . Changes in gene expression levels following CNS injury and drug application were determined using Ct - Ct plots ( Hui et al . , 2009 ) , this analysis is a modification of the ÎÎCT and efficiency correction methods ( Livak and Schmittgen , 2001 ) . The efficiency of the amplification is assumed to be independent of the sample , and the standard curves from all the samples are linear . Assuming that the PCR efficiencies are independent of the sample , a Ct - Ct plot is created by plotting the Ct ( threshold cycle ) values of the test gene against the control gene . This yields a linear correlation between the gene pair and the slope ( m ) of the plot that is described as m = log ( E c ) / log ( E g ) . The Y axis of these plots is described by Ct g = m x Ct c â log ( R ) / log ( E g ) ; where R is the relative expression level between the target gene ( Q g ) and control gene ( Q c ) ; Eg is the amplification efficiency of the target gene ; Ct g and Ct c are the threshold cycles of the target gene and control gene , respectively ( Hui et al . , 2009 ) . The Y - intercept , a quotient of â log ( R ) / log ( E g ) , is used as a measure of R , because E g is constant . Thus , a small change in the Y - intercept in the injury group over the control group indicates a decrease in the relative target - gene expression level . 26 Table 1 . Gene specific primer sequences , product size for qPCR 27 2 . 6 Primary cell culture Snails were anaesthetized for 10 minutes in 10 % ( v / v ) Listerine , and the ganglia were excised in snail saline containing ( mM ) : NaCl 51 . 3 , KCl 1 . 7 , CaCl2 4 . 1 , MgCl2 1 . 5 , HEPES 2 ( adjusted to pH 7 . 9 using 1 mM NaOH ) . The ganglia were then incubated in 3 mg / ml trypsin ( Type III , Sigma , Ontario , Canada ) for 24 min . PeA neurons , which are involved in locomotion ( Spencer et al . , 1995 ) , were identified and isolated from pedal ganglion with gentle suction using a Sigmacoted ( Sigma , Ontario , Canada ) fire - polished pipette ( 2 mm , WPI , 1B200F ) as previously described ( Syed et al . , 1990 ; Feng et al . , 2000 ) . The neurons were then placed onto a poly - L - lysine coated culture dish and maintained in conditioned medium ( CM ) at room temperature ( Syed et al . , 1990 ; Spencer et al . , 1996 ; Feng et al . , 2000 ) . 2 . 7 RNAi synthesis and delivery Similar to previous studies dsRNA and siRNA were used for gene silencing experiments ( Hui et al . , 2007 ; Guo et al . , 2010 ) . 27 - mer siRNA , based on the L . stagnalis C / EBP sequence was designed using SciTools RNAi Design online software ( IDT DNA ) . When choosing siRNA we selected for sequences with moderate to low G / C content , biased towards the 3â - terminus and purposely avoided sequences encoding the transmembrane domains ( Reynolds et al . , 2004 ) . Control siRNA was design such that it had the same composition as the selected siRNA sequence , but had no obvious homology with the mRNA . The selected sequences were then purchased from Shanghai GenePharma Co . , Ltd ( Table 2 ) . For the synthesis of the long dsRNA , we designed gene specific primers corresponding to the mRNA fragments with a T7 phage polymerase promoter sequence added onto the 5â end ( Table 3 ) . Conventional PCR ( PTC - 100TM Programmable Thermal Controllor ) was used to amplify the gene specific RNA with the T7 promoter sequence . A 10 Î¼l reaction volume was constructed with 5 Î¼l of 2 X PCR master mix ( Fermentas , USA ) containing : 0 . 05 Î¼l Taq DNA Polymerase , reaction buffer , 4 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 4 mM of each dNTP ( dATP , dCTP , dGTP , dTTP ) , 1 Î¼l of gene specific T7 forward and reverse primers ( Table 3 ) , 1 Î¼l of cDNA library and 3 Î¼l of RNAse free water . The sample was amplified using the following temperature profile : 94Â°C / 2 min , 35 cycles of 94Â°C / 0 . 5 min , and 72Â°C / 0 . 5 min , and finally 72Â°C / 10 min . Amplified product was then purified using the PureLinkTM PCR Purification Kit ( Invitrogen , USA ) . Control dsRNA was 28 synthesized from a linearized non - coding gWIZ - pBSK vector with T7 forward and T3 reverse promoter sequences . RNA was transcribed using MEGAscript High Yield Transcription Kit ( Ambion ) following directions provided by the manufacturer . Synthesized RNA nucleotides were then denatured in 85 o C water bath for 10 minutes and allowed to gradually anneal as the bath cooled . For whole animal knockdown experiments snails were anaesthetized with 10 % ( v / v ) Listerine , following which 2 Î¼l of 20 Î¼M control RNAi or gene specific RNAi was injected into the head above the central ganglion using a microlitre syringe ( Hamilton Company , Reno , NV , USA ) ( Guo et al . , 2010 ) . 48 hrs post - injection the ganglia were removed and RNA extraction was performed in order to confirm the RNAi knockdown using qPCR . 29 Table 2 . Custom siRNA sequences used in the knockdown study for C / EBP Table 3 . Primer sequences for dsRNA synthesis , T - 7 promoter sequence ( 5â - TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG - 3â ) has been tagged onto the gene specific sequences in order to transcribe RNA into dsRNA . 30 2 . 8 Axotomy and neurite outgrowth L . stagnalis PeA cells were cultured in CM at room temperature for 48 hours , allowing for sufficient neurite outgrowth . Transection of the neurite was then performed using a glass micropipette , controlled by a micromanipulator , and moving it perpendicularly across the neurite until a complete cut was observed ( Erez et al . , 2007 ; Nejatbakhsh et al . , 2009 ) . Immediately following axotomy the cells were treated with either culture media ( CM ) or a final concentration of 7 nM C / EBP siRNA / control siRNA or 7 nM gene specific dsRNA / control dsRNA in a final volume of 2 mL of culture media . Images of neurites were collected at the time of RNAi treatment ( t = 0 ) , and over a 24 hr period ( t = 24 ) , using an inverted microscope ( 40x objective ) ( Olympus CK X41 ) with a digital camera ( Olympus C5050 ) . The lengths of the proximal neurite , the distal neurite as well as an intact neurite of the axotomized cell were measured at t = 0 and t = 24 hrs , using ImageTool 3 . 1 software ( UTHSCSA , Texas ) . 2 . 9 Calcium imaging Intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ( [ Ca ] i ) was measured using a fura - 2 ratiometric Ca 2 + imaging system ( Feng et al . , 2002 ; Hui et al . , 2007 ) . Cultured PeA neurons were washed with snail saline . Cells were loaded with 2 ÂµM Fura - 2 AM ( Molecular Probes ) , and pluronic acid F - 127 ( Molecular Probes ) in the standard external solution for 30 min at 37Â°C in the dark . The cells are then washed again three times with the external solution and incubated for another 15 min at 37Â°C in the dark prior to imaging . All of the experiments were carried out in the dark to prevent photobleaching of the dye . Fura - 2 was alternately excited at 340 and 380 nm by illumination generated by a 100 W Hg / Xe - arc lamp that had passed through 340 and 380 nm excitation filters ; this process was controlled by Image Pro 5 software ( PTI ) . The fluorescence signal was reflected via a 430 nm dichroic mirror , passed through a 510 nm emission filter and detected and digitized by an intensified charged - coupled device ( ICCD ) camera ( Roper Scientific ) in Image Pro 5 at 1 - 10 Hz . The fluorescence intensity ( Poenie - Tsien ) ratios of images acquired at 340 and 380 nm were calculated using Image Pro 5 . 2 . 10 Immunocytochemistry and confocal imaging Cultured PeA cells were fixed with 1 % paraformaldehyde in snail saline solution overnight at 4Â°C . Cells were then washed three times with snail saline , and incubated with a monoclonal 31 mouse Î² - tubulin antibody ( diluted 1 : 200 , Sigma Aldrich ) in snail saline solution containing 0 . 3 % Trition X - 100 for 4 hrs at room temperature . The cells were subsequently washed four times with snail saline , and incubated with goat anti - mouse 2 o antibody ( diluted 1 : 200 ; Invitrogen ) and rhodamine phalloidin ( diluted 1 : 100 ; Invitrogen ) in snail saline solution containing 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 for 2 hours at room temperature in the dark . The cells were then washed four times and air dried for 5 min , and the preparation was mounted with permafluor ( Fisher Scientific , Canada ) . The fluorescence microscopy was conducted using a TCS SL laser confocal microscope ( Leica Confocal Software , version 2 . 5 , build 1347 , Leica Microsystems , Germany ) . z - series scan images of labeled cells were viewed under a 40 or 60X oil immersion lens using a Ar and Green He Ne laser . The goat anti - mouse 2 o antibody was excited at 488 nm the phalloidin was excited at 568 nm . Each plane was averaged three times using a step size between each plane of approximately 0 . 3Î¼ m . Background fluorescence was determined using three regions not encompassing cells throughout the entire z - stack . The resolution of the final image was 1024 by 1024 pixels . 2 . 11 Bioinformatics Identified sequences were translated using ExPASy online software http : / / ca . expasy . org / tools / dna . html , and the protein sequences were blasted with http : / / blast . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / Blast . cgi and the closest matches recorded .

The snails were giver 5 minutes to acclimate to their environment , after this time they were recorded for 10 minutes with a video camera using Virtual Dub 1 . 9 software and the distance each snail travelled was measured and analyzed using ImageTool 3 . 1 software ( UTHSCSA , Texas ) ( Fei and Feng , 2008 ) . 32 2 . 13 Statistics Data are presented as mean Â± S .

Identification of the role of C / EBP in neurite regeneration following microarray analysis of a L . stagnalis CNS injury model i 3 . 1 Introduction Injuries of the CNS can lead to devastating and irreversible loss of function because adult mammalian CNS neurons have a limited regenerative capacity ( Aguayo et al . , 1981 ; Blesch and Tuszynski , 2009 ) . This is partially due to an age dependent reduction in the intrinsic regenerative potential of CNS neurons ( Curinga and Smith , 2008 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ) . In contrast , some adult invertebrate neurons are capable of spontaneous regeneration following injury ( Hasan et al . , 1993 ; Blackmore and Letourneau , 2006 ) . Lymnaea stagnalis has served as a critical model system because of its ability to spontaneously regenerate and restore function in the adult central nervous system ( Janse et al . , 1979 ; Hermann et al . , 2000 ; Hermann et al . , 2005 ) . Since many molecular mechanisms are conserved across species , the identification of molecules involved in neuronal regeneration in the L . stagnalis will aid in our understanding of factors which may promote regeneration in the mammalian CNS . One main limitation of using L . stagnalis in genetic functional studies of neuronal regeneration has been a lack of large - scale screening tools , such as microarray analysis ( Marciano et al . , 2002 ; Dash et al . , 2004 ; Munro and Perreau , 2009 ) . To circumvent this limitation , we have recently sequenced more than 10 , 000 ESTs ( expression sequence tags ) from the CNS transcriptome of L . stagnalis ( Feng et al . , 2009 ) and established the largest neuronal EST database in Lymnaea ( www . lymnaea . org ) . In combination with the availability of the microarray technology , these gene sequences provide us with the opportunity to perform a high throughput screening for altered gene expression levels following nerve injury in the L . stagnalis . In this study , we have designed the first microarray chip covering 10 , 333 known L . stagnalis genes to profile the gene expression patterns following CNS injury . We identified 348 genes that were differentially regulated following CNS crush . Using real - time qPCR analysis we confirmed that the gene expression level of CCAAT enhancer binding protein ( C / EBP ) , a transcription factor , is 34 up - regulated following nerve injury . Knockdown of C / EBP following axotomy of cultured PeA cells lead to retraction of the distal axon . This indicates that C / EBP plays a crucial role in neuronal regeneration of Lymnaea neurons by maintaining the viability of the distal neurite . 3 . 2 Results 3 . 2 . 1 CNS injury model of L . stagnalis In order to profile the gene expression patterns following injury of the central nervous system , we modified an established ( Koert et al . , 2001 ; Hermann et al . , 2005 ) nerve injury model by crushing the right parietal ( RPa ) and right cerebral nerves ( RCe ) ( Figure 1A ) . In control groups , sham operations were performed without nerve injury . 3 . 2 . 2 Identification of differentially expressed genes To search for genes that may be involved in neuronal regeneration or degeneration , microarray analyses were carried out to compare the gene expression levels between the sham - operated and crush - operated CNS models ( Figure 1A ) . We used an unpaired t - test for comparison of the 15 , 000 array signals between two groups : sham - and crush - operated groups . This analysis resulted in the selection of 348 genes or ESTs that were differentially regulated 3 hrs following CNS injury ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Further screening for genes with a fold - change > 2 resulted in a final group of 67 differentially expressed genes . Figure 1C shows a heat map representing the hierarchical clustering of the 67 genes with significant differential expression levels between the control and injured groups . Overall , more genes were up - regulated ( n = 42 ) than down - regulated ( n = 25 ) , suggesting that diverse regulatory pathways and biological processes are activated within the first 3 hrs following injury ( Figure 1B - 1 ) . Among the 67 regulated genes only 16 have been identified with known functions related to development , survival or signal transduction ( Table 4 ) . Interestingly , the functions of the majority of genes ( 51 ) have not been described ( Figure 1B - 2 ) . 3 . 2 . 3 Gene expression levels of C / EBP change in a time dependent manner following injury The microarray analysis indicated that the mRNA level of CCAAT enhancer binding protein , C / EBP , was significantly increased 3 hrs following CNS injury , as compared to the sham control 35 group . A protein sequence alignment of C / EBP orthologues from L . stagnalis , Aplysia , rat , and human revealed that C / EBP has a high homology in the DNA - binding domain , suggesting that C / EBP may have similar biological functions in these species ( Figure 2 ) . To confirm that C / EBP is indeed up - regulated following nerve injury at 3 hrs , we performed conventional qPCR analysis . We found that the expression level of C / EBP mRNA significantly increased , compared to the control gene GAPDH , in the injured CNS group ( 2 . 35 Â± 0 . 26 fold ; n = 5 , P < 0 . 05 ) over the sham groups ( Figure 3A ) . To study its temporal expression pattern , we further measured the gene level of C / EBP at 1 hr , 3 hrs and 5 hrs post CNS injury using real time qPCR analysis . The standard curves for C / EBP are shown in Figure 3B with a slope of - 3 . 52 , indicating the PCR efficiency for the primers are sufficient ( Figure 3B ) . To visualize the gene expression level between the injured and sham groups , the threshold cycles ( Ct ) of C / EBP ( the target gene ) and GAPDH ( the control gene ) were plotted against each other , as described previously ( Hui et al . , 2009 ) . Figure 3C shows the representatives of Ct - Ct correlation plots between the C / EBP and GADPH gene pair at the three different time points ( 1 hr , 3 hrs , 5 hrs ) . The slopes of the plots were consistent in all experimental samples , indicating the equality in amplification efficiencies between the primers of the gene pair . The Y - intercepts ( â log ( R ) / log ( E g ) ) of these plots were smaller in the injury group ( crush ) than in the controls ( sham ) at all the times tested , indicating the relative expression level of C / EBP mRNA increased following injury . Specifically , C / EBP mRNA was initially increased by 7 . 36 Â± 0 . 73 , ( n = 5 ) at 1 hr after CNS injury , but appeared to reduce to 2 . 35 Â± 0 . 26 ( n = 5 ) by 3 hrs and 1 . 98 Â± 0 . 75 , ( n = 5 ) by 5hrs , albeit at levels that are still significantly greater than in sham - operated ( control ) animal ( Figure 3D ) . These results suggest that elevation of C / EBP mRNA expression may be necessary for transcriptional induction of regeneration associated genes , and thus likely to be a direct target of injury induced signaling cascades that promote neuronal repair . 3 . 2 . 4 The role of C / EBP in axonal elongation following axotomy The increased expression of C / EBP mRNA following nerve injury in vivo suggests that this protein may be an upstream gene regulator of either pro - regenerative genes or responsive genes for cell injury . To elucidate the functional significance of C / EBP mRNA following nerve injury , we examined the effect of C / EBP on axonal outgrowth and regeneration on PeA neurons in 36 culture using a siRNA gene silencing approach , as described previously ( Nejatbakhsh et al . , 2009 ) . Axotomy was performed on cultured PeA neurons , which had undergone adequate neurite outgrowth ( Figure 4A ) . Immediately following axotomy , cells were treated with either , control culture media ( CM ) , control siRNA or C / EBP siRNA . The lengths of the proximal and distal ends of the axotomized neurite , as well as an intact neurite were measured over a 24 hr period , as described previously ( Nejatbakhsh et al . , 2009 ) . Compared to control CM , and control siRNA treated cells , the net increase in length of the proximal end and the intact neurites of C / EBP siRNA treated cells did not show significant changes over the 24 hours following axotomy . However , the distal end axons in the C / EBP siRNA treated cells retracted ( - 12 . 43 Â± 8 . 95 , n = 15 ) whereas that in control CM ( + 17 . 77Â± 8 . 27 , n = 22 ) and control siRNA treated cells continued to elongate ( 19 . 68 Â± 7 . 83 , n = 24 ) 24 hours following axotomy ( Fig . 4B ) . The net changes in the distal axons were significant between the C / EBP siRNA and the control CM and control siRNA groups ( P < 0 . 05 ) . These findings suggest that sufficient C / EBP levels are required for maintaining the integrity of the distal axon . Due to the application of siRNAs following axotomy , the differences found in the distal axons may be associated with local protein synthesis . 3 . 2 . 5 C / EBP siRNA treatment hinders locomotion recovery in vivo following CNS injury In order to determine whether C / EBP siRNA treatment has a role in injured animals , we compared the locomotion activity of the snails treated with control or C / EBP siRNA followed by RPa and RCe nerve crush . The distances that the snails crawled in 10 min was measured before and after nerve crush ( 1 , 5 and 10 days post - crush ) and compared between control siRNA and C / EBP siRNA injected groups . As shown in Figure 5 , both groups had severely impaired movement following the nerve crush - operation , but slowly gained their ability to crawl over the course of 10 days . However , after 10 days , the distance ( per 10 min ) measured from the C / EBP siRNA group ( 4 . 99 Â± 0 . 71 cm , n = 3 ) was significantly shorter than the control siRNA group ( 10 . 17 Â± 1 . 00 cm , n = 5 ) ( P < 0 . 05 ) . This data suggests that C / EBP siRNA treatment disrupted the recovery of snails from nerve injury and support the notion that C / EBP knockdown impedes CNS regeneration in vivo , potentially through its effects on the distal neurites . 37 Figure 1 .

Data are present by mean Â± s . e . d . 47 Figure 5 48 Figure 6 . Schematic illustration of the potential mechanisms of C / EBP action in maintaining distal axon integrity following axotomy . C / EBP mRNA is expressed in both the soma and axon ( Nadeau et al . , 2005 ; Yan et al . , 2009 ) . In the soma , C / EBP functions as a transcription factor and results in the transcription of regenerative - associated genes , such as Î² - tubulin and GAP - 43 , via a cAMP / PKA / CREB dependent signaling pathway ( Nadeau et al . , 2005 ) . Axon injury also activates an ERK - dependent pathway that results in the phosphorylation of C / EBP and further activation of pro - regenerative genes ( Sung et al . , 2001 ) . In the distal axon the DLK - 1 pathway regulates C / EBP mRNA stability following axotomy ( Yan et al . , 2009 ) . Local protein synthesis of C / EBP in the distal axon may be required for regeneration or to prevent degeneration of distal axons following injury . 49 Figure 6 50 3 . 3 Discussion In this study , we designed the first Lymnaea gene chip for microarray analysis and profiled the gene expression patterns during the early stages of CNS repair following injury . We found that 67 genes were significantly regulated during the first three hours post injury , including the transcription factor C / EBP . We further studied the temporal gene regulation pattern of C / EBP following CNS injury using real time qPCR analysis , and found that C / EBP gene levels were significantly up - regulated 7 fold , 1 hr after CNS injury , and decreased to a 2 fold increase at 3 hrs . Subsequently , C / EBP mRNA levels were maintained at the 2 fold increase for at least 5 hrs . Reduction of C / EBP mRNA levels by C / EBP siRNA treatment following axotomy caused retraction of the distal neurite in vitro , suggesting local protein synthesis of C / EBP mRNA in the distal axon . Our observation that C / EBP siRNA treatment disrupted the recovery of locomotory function of the snails following nerve injury in vivo further support the notion that C / EBP is required for nerve regeneration . C / EBP is expressed along the axon , in the cell body , and at the synapse ( Brown et al . , 2004 ) , indicating that this gene may act in distal regions of the axon to up - regulate local mechanisms of regeneration . 3 . 3 . 1 Regeneration in the CNS of Lymnaea stagnalis L . stagnalis has been used as a simple and reliable model to investigate genes involved in regeneration , due to its ability to functionally recover following CNS injury in vivo . For example , central ganglia cell ( CGC ) connections to buccal ganglia were crushed to disrupt feeding behavior in animals . Two weeks following the procedure the CGC regenerated , functional synapses formed between proper synaptic partners and the feeding behaviour was again observed ( Koert et al . , 2001 ) . In vivo CNS regeneration was also observed following axotomy of innervating axons to the pneumostome and surrounding areas which prevented the occurrence of lung respiration in 69 % of snails . Several weeks following surgery , axonal regeneration leading to the reformation of functional synapses was observed and pneumostome opening returned to normal ( Hermann et al . , 2000 ) . In our modified CNS injury model , we crushed both the right parietal ( RPa ) nerves as well as the right cerebral nerves ( RCe ) ( Figure 1A ) . We are interested in the gene regulation occurring at the early stages of CNS trauma , thus most of our in vivo experiments were completed within 5 hours following injury . 51 3 . 3 . 2 Microarray Analysis Following CNS Injury The ability to profile the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously makes microarrays an invaluable biomedical research tool ( Murphy , 2002 ) . The technique allows for the quick identification of genes that may alter regenerative ability in the mammalian CNS . It has previously been used to assess the genes involved in anti - inflammatory responses in a spinal cord injury model . The anti - inflammatory response is an important component of secondary tissue damage following spinal cord injury . The microarray study allowed for identification of a conserved novel regulator of regeneration , and provided a new mechanism by which to initiate the regenerative response ( Carmel et al . , 2001 ) . However , microarrays are not without their limitations , shortcomings of microarray analysis are associated with poor reliability , and specificity ( Duggan et al . , 1999 ; Murphy , 2002 ; Asyali and Alci , 2005 ; Patterson et al . , 2006 ) . Due to the inherent sources of error in microarray technology , it is necessary to confirm the findings using an independent methodology from separate samples . Real - time quantitative PCR is a readily used technique to confirm microarray data ( Patterson et al . , 2006 ) . In our study , we also conducted qPCR analysis using different samples and verified that the expression of C / EBP was indeed up - regulated following nerve injury . 3 . 3 . 3 Time - dependent Regulation of C / EBP Recovery from nerve injury and neuronal regeneration are time - dependent events , from the initial inflammatory response to the development of the glial scar ( Hagg and Oudega , 2006 ) . Inflammation , neurotransmitter dysfunction , ionic imbalance , cytoskeletal alteration and increased transcription occur as early as 3 hrs following spinal cord injury ( Ruda et al . , 2000 ; Song et al . , 2001 ; Tachibana et al . , 2002 ) . Nerve outgrowth and regeneration can be enhanced by steroids during a critical window within the first 6 hrs following nerve injury ( Tanzer and Jones , 2004 ) . In the C . elegans , axons regenerate following axotomy in vivo and by 24 hrs fully functional synapses are formed ( Yanik et al . , 2004 ) . We have recently demonstrated that L . stagnalis regeneration post injury in vitro can be seen as early as 3 hrs , and reformation of connections between the proximal and distal axon is observed by 24hrs ( Nejatbakhsh et al . , 2009 ) . Deducing the gene regulation during the early response following neuronal injury is important in uncovering the molecular basis of neuronal regeneration . In this study , our 52 microarray gene expression analysis identified 67 genes that were significantly regulated following CNS injury in the L . stagnalis . We examined C / EBP gene expression at three different time points ( 1 hr , 3 hrs , 5 hrs ) in order to understand how it is regulated temporally in the early stages of recovery and repair . Our results indicated that the gene is up - regulated in a time - dependent manner following CNS injury ( Figure 3 ) . We further showed the locomotory activity of the control snails was severely disrupted immediately following nerve injury but recovered gradually over 10 days . However , C / EBP siRNA treatment prior to nerve crush procedure disrupted the recovery of locomotory function of the snails ( Figure 5 ) , suggesting that C / EBP is required for nerve regeneration in vivo . 3 . 3 . 4 Role of C / EBP in the Distal Neurite C / EBPs belong to the basic leucine zipper DNA binding protein family and are transcription factors with diverse cellular roles , including regulating cell growth , differentiation , apoptosis , and learning and memory ( Menard et al . , 2002 ; Marshall et al . , 2003 ; Hatakeyama et al . , 2006 ) . C / EBPs are also responsive to brain injury and ischemia ( Kfoury and Kapatos , 2009 ; Ejarque - Ortiz et al . , 2010 ) . Six isoforms of C / EBP have been found in mammals ( Poli , 1998 ) , and C / EBP ï¢ is highly homologous to Lymnaea C / EBP ( L C / EBP ) ( Hatakeyama et al . , 2004 ) . C / EBP ï¢ was first identified as a mediator of the inflammatory response and IL - 6 signaling through its binding to IL - 6 response elements in the promoters of acute phase response genes TNF , IL - 8 , and G - CSF ( Akira et al . , 1990 ) . C / EBP expression is enriched in neurons , up - regulated following brain injury ( Cortes - Canteli et al . , 2002 ; Cortes - Canteli et al . , 2004 ; Nadeau et al . , 2005 ) and in various neuronal regenerative animal models where its expression is regulated by transcription factors such as CREB and NFIL - 3 ( Korneev et al . , 1997 ; Sung et al . , 2001 ; MacGillavry et al . , 2011 ) . Aplysia nerve injury activates axoplasmic kinase , RISK - 1 , which phosphorylates apC / EBP ï¢ and initiates the binding of apC / EBP ï¢ to the ERE enhancer site in vitro . Increases in RISK - 1 and apC / EBP were detected in injured neurons ( Sung et al . , 2001 ) . In leech , C / EBP mRNA was increased during neuronal regeneration ( Korneev et al . , 1997 ) . In this study , we show that C / EBP mRNA expression is increased following CNS injury in a time - dependent manner . The 7 - fold increase in C / EBP mRNA at 1 hr following injury is likely related to the inflammatory response . The sustained 2 fold increase over the 5 hr period suggests that it may be essential for transcriptional induction of regeneration associated genes . Knockdown of C / EBP mRNA expression following axotomy by target - gene siRNA caused a reduction in neurite 53 outgrowth , as compared to control . Surprisingly this phenomenon was observed only in the distal axons . Due to the fact that siRNAs were applied following axotomy , our data suggests that local C / EBP mRNA is likely involved in neuronal regeneration / elongation . It is unexpected to observe a lack of significant inhibition in the proximal re - growth ( Figure 4B ) although the net growth of the proximal length was reduced in C / EBP siRNA group . This could simply reflect that a partial knockdown ( ~ 40 % ) of C / EBP was not sufficient to cause the disruption of the regenerative properties of the neurites that are in contact with the cell soma . In contrast to the distal section of neurites which may rely on local protein synthesis , the cell somata continuously provide complimentary mechanisms to sustain neurite properties . Following axotomy , the distal segment undergoes wallerian degeneration and the proximal end either degenerates or attempts to re - connect with its target ( Waller 1850 ) . An alternative mechanism of regeneration occurs in invertebrates , whereby the proximal axon directly connects with the distal fragment and prevents it from degenerating ( Hoy et al . , 1967 ; Carbonetto and Muller , 1977 ; Deriemer et al . , 1983 ) . In the C . elegans when mechanosensory neurons are axotomized the proximal and distal segments will re - grow , if they make contact the distal fragment survives , otherwise it undergoes wallerian degeneration ( Yanik et al . , 2004 ) . In this case the balance between regeneration and degeneration shifts and results in recovery of neuronal function . A similar process is observed in the Lymnaea , whereby the proximal and distal ends reconnect after axotomy , which protects the distal end from degenerating . This illustrates the importance of the distal fragments , and the maintenance of their integrity through C / EBP , for successful regeneration in this model system . CEBP - 1 , a member of the C / EBP family in the C . elegans , is a direct effecter of the DLK - 1 cascade ( Yan et al . , 2009 ) . CEBP - 1 mRNA has been found in the axons and presynaptic regions , and is stabilized via its 3âUTR by activation of the dual - leucine zipper Kinase - 1 ( DLK - 1 ) pathway ( Yan et al . , 2009 ) . The role of C / EBP in axon regeneration is suggested via dual - leucine zipper kinase MAPKKK ( DLK - 1 ) - dependent pathway ( Yan et al . , 2009 ) . Neuronal regeneration associated proteins such as ï¡ - tubulin and GAP - 43 , are transcriptional targets of C / EBP ( Miller et al . , 1989 ; Menard et al . , 2002 ; Nadeau et al . , 2005 ) . Following nerve injury , up - regulation of C / EBPÎ² mRNA and C / EBP phosphoprotein coincides with increases in the transcription of the Î± - tubulin promoter in the wild - type but not in C / EBPÎ² â / â mice ( Nadeau et al . , 2005 ) . DLK - 1 acts in a MAPK cascade with MAPMKKK - 4 and p38 kinase ( Nakata et al . , 2005 ) . Both the 54 DLK - 1 pathway and CEBP - 1 were necessary for regenerative growth of adult touch neurons ( Yan et al . , 2009 ) . We thus proposed a model by which the DLK - 1 pathway regulates C / EBP mRNA stability , leading to its increased translation at synapses and maintenance of the distal axon ( Figure 6 ) . Local protein synthesis has been shown to increase in injured axons and thus play an important role in the regeneration - degradation process ( Willis and Twiss , 2006 ; Wang et al . , 2007 ; Wang et al . , 2010 ) . Our study provided the first evidence that local regulation of C / EBP mRNA in axons is important for outgrowth and regeneration in the L . stagnalis . 55 4 . Bioinformatic analysis reveals a novel role for BCL 7 in neurite regeneration 4 . 1 Introduction Failure of spontaneous regeneration in the adult CNS results in limited recovery following spinal cord injury . One of the critical steps in successful regeneration is the transformation of the injured axonal end into a growth cone , a specialized compartment that integrates extracellular signals into dynamic growth patterns ( Erez et al . , 2007 ; Kamber et al . , 2009 ) . The transformation of the injured axon into a retraction bulb rather than a growth cone indicates the presence of intrinsic or environmental factors which interfere with the regeneration process ( Lobato , 2008 ) . Identification of these factors can lead to novel therapeutic strategies for improving regeneration in the CNS . Currently , hundreds of genes and molecules have been implicated in CNS regeneration , including those involved in both intrinsic and extrinsic processes , and altering the expression of any one of these may have a limited impact on CNS regeneration ( Aguayo et al . , 1981 ; Muramatsu et al . , 2009 ) . Although manipulating molecules such as cAMP , GSK3Î² and PTEN have been shown to enhance regeneration , successful functional regeneration has not been shown to be the result of a single gene ( Nikulina et al . , 2004 ; Brown et al . , 2004 ; Park et al . , 2010 ) . Consequently , identifying the molecular pathways that underlie axonal regeneration is a more promising approach for the treatment of CNS injuries . Recently , large scale gene - expression profiling and bioinformatics has been applied to understand the role of known proteins in a biological context and interpret them in the context of a protein network ( Antonov et al . , 2009 ) . We have recently taken advantage of the newly available partial transcriptome for the L . staganlis ( Feng et al . , 2009 ) , a model for successful CNS regeneration , to profile the gene expression changes following CNS injury ( Figure 1 ) . From this study , we identified 67 genes whose expressions were significantly altered during injury . In order to identify a novel signaling network we employed a proteomic analysis approach using protein - protein interaction ( PPI ) networks to interpret identified protein lists ( Xu et al . , 56 2010 ; Alberio et al . , 2010 ; Silverman - Gavrila et al . , 2011 ) . One such tool is the web - based PPI spider ( http : / / mips . helmholtz - muenchen . de / proj / ppispider ) , which develops a PPI network model based on known protein - protein interactions from the literature . A useful and important feature of this software is that it takes into account that there may be proteins missing from the list and automatically includes the most relevant missing proteins . The output is a model of protein - protein interactions that represent the most probable scenario of how proteins within the list are functionally connected ( Antonov et al . , 2009 ) . Microarray analysis in the L . stagnalis identified various genes potentially involved in CNS regeneration ; we then used PPI software and identified a novel signaling pathway . The proposed network included BCL 7 and protein phosphatase 1k . In this study an RNAi approach was used to manipulate the gene expression levels of BCL 7 and protein phosphatase 1k , and examine their roles following neuronal injury . 4 . 2 Results 4 . 2 . 1 Network mapping using a bioinformatics approach In order to test if there are potential interactions among the genes that were identified in the microarray study we used PPI - spider ( http : / / mips . helmholtz - muenchen . de / proj / ppispider ) software . PPI - spider is a newly developed tool for predicting networks based on known protein - protein interactions ( Antonov et al . , 2009 ) . Among the 67 genes identified , PPI - spider predicted a novel signaling network which included 5 proteins : band - 4 protein - 2 , phosphoinositide kinase , BCL 7 , protein phosphatase 1k , and Sec24 ( Figure 7 ) . The network also consisted of other suggested interactor proteins not identified in the microarray : calmodulin - 1 , SPARC - like protein 1 , BCL 6 , and bone sialoprotein . The predicted network represents a novel signaling cascade that may be involved in CNS regeneration in L . stagnalis . Based on this model two genes were tested for their involvement in neural injury , BCL 7 and protein phosphatase 1k . 4 . 2 . 2 Down - regulation of protein phosphatase 1k following CNS injury Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are major regulatory mechanisms of cellular functions such as cell signal transduction . Protein phosphatase 1k , which was revealed by PPI - spider to be part of the proposed signaling network , is a novel PP2C isoform targeted exclusively to the mitochondria matrix . This family of Serine / threonine phosphatases , share a common 57 catalytic domain which suggests some function is conserved between species ( Figure 8A ) . Our microarray study revealed that protein phosphatase 1k mRNA expression decreased 3 hrs after CNS injury in the L . stagnalis model ( Table 4 ) . Using qPCR , we further examined the temporal regulation of protein phosphatase 1k gene expression , compared to control GADPH , and found that its expression showed a decrease at 1hr ( 0 . 43 Â± 0 . 13 , n = 5 , P < 0 . 05 ) and 3 hrs ( 0 . 34 Â± 0 . 19 , n = 5 , P < 0 . 05 ) following CNS injury , but recovered to control levels by 5 hrs ( 1 . 2 Â± 0 . 4 , n = 5 ) ( Figure 8B ) . The early down regulation of protein phosphatase 1k after CNS crush i n vivo suggests it may play a role in the immediate response to injury . In order to determine if protein phosphatase 1k is involved in neurite outgrowth or retraction of CNS neurons after injury we used a gene silencing approach . Axotomy was performed on PeA neurons cultured for 48 hrs to allow for adequate neurite outgrowth ( Figure 9A ) . Immediately after axotomy , cells were treated with either control or protein phosphatase 1k dsRNA . Three different neurite lengths were measured over the next 24 hrs , the lengths of the intact neurite as well as the proximal and distal neurites . We found that a 51 . 3 Â± 9 . 6 % knockdown of protein phosphatase 1k expression , confirmed by whole animal qPCR , had no significant effect on neurite outgrowth , as no difference was observed between intact control ( 29 . 52 Â± 9 . 2 Âµm , n = 16 ) and intact protein phosphatase 1k dsRNA treated ( 35 . 4 Â± 12 Âµm , n = 33 ) cells . Similarly , knockdown of protein phosphatase 1k did not affect regeneration from the proximal ( 2 . 9 Â± 2 . 6 Âµm , n = 18 ) , and distal ( 22 . 34 Â± 10 . 6 Âµm , n = 18 ) neurites as compared to control dsRNA treated cells proximal ( 13 . 9 Â± 4 . 1 Âµm , n = 36 ) and distal ( 32 Â± 9 . 2 Âµm , n = 36 ) neurites ( Figure 9 ) . These results suggest that the down - regulation of protein phosphatase 1k mRNA is likely not involved in outgrowth and regeneration . 4 . 2 . 3 A novel role for BCL 7 in CNS regeneration The PPI - spider also identified BCL 7 to be involved in the proposed signaling cascade . A protein sequence alignment of BCL 7 orthologues from L . stagnalis , C . elegans , drosophila , mouse , and humans reveal a strong sequence similarity at the N - terminus , suggesting that it may be involved in an evolutionarily conserved function ( Figure 10A ) . However , the function of BCL 7 is currently unknown , which led us to examine its role in CNS regeneration . In order to examine the time - dependent regulation of BCL 7 expression during the course of injury , we performed conventional qPCR analysis on samples 1 hr , 3 hrs , and 5 hrs following 58 CNS injury ( Figure 10B ) . Compared to the control gene GAPDH , we found that the expression level of BCL 7 mRNA did not increase significantly until 5 hrs after CNS injury ( 2 . 5 Â± 0 . 6 fold ; n = 5 , P < 0 . 05 ) . These results suggest that BCL 7 may be important in promoting CNS regeneration in L . stagnalis . In order to elucidate the functional significance of BCL 7 up - regulation , we examined the effect of Bcl7 knockdown on axonal outgrowth and regeneration in cultured PeA neurons using a dsRNA . One neurite of each PeA neuron was axotomized 48 hours after they were cultured to allow for adequate neurite outgrowth ( Figure 11A ) . Immediately following axotomy , cells were treated with either control dsRNA or BCL 7 dsRNA . The knockdown was confirmed by qPCR , which showed that BCL 7 expression was reduced to 52 . 1 Â± 7 . 1 % of control levels compared to GADPH ( Figure 11C ) . The lengths of the proximal and distal ends of the axotomized neurite , as well as an intact neurite from the same cell , were then measured over 24hrs , as described previously . Compared to the length of control dsRNA treated cells ( 13 . 9 Â± 4 . 1 Âµm , n = 36 ) , there was a net decrease in length of the proximal neurite ( - 7 . 9 Â± 6 Âµm , n = 23 ) of BCL 7 dsRNA treated cells . There was also a reduction in the distal neurite length in BCL 7 dsRNA treated cells ( 2 . 2 Â± 9 . 3 Âµm , n = 23 ) compared to control dsRNA ( 32 Â± 9 . 2 Âµm , n = 36 ) . Likewise , there was a reduction in the lengths of the intact neurite in BCL 7 dsRNA treated cells ( - 7 . 7 Â± 10 . 7 Âµm , n = 19 ) compared to control dsRNA treated cells ( 35 . 4 Â± 12 Âµm , n = 33 ) ( Figure 11B ) . These findings suggest that BCL 7 prevents neurite degeneration and promotes neurite outgrowth following axotomy . 4 . 2 . 4 BCL 7 impairs neurite outgrowth following axotomy The transformation of the cut neurite end into a growth cone is a critical step in the regenerative process after injury . Following axotomy , in BCL 7 knockdown cells , there was a retraction of both the distal and proximal ends after 24 hrs ( Figure 12 ) . In order to determine whether BCL 7 has an effect on growth cone formation , we used live cell - imaging to examine the transformation of the axon into a growth cone following axotomy in control dsRNA and BCL 7 dsRNA treated cells over the course of 1 . 5 hrs ( Figure 12 ) . Five minutes after axotomy , the control dsRNA treated cells showed an initial retraction of the proximal ( - 79 Â± 16 . 2 , n = 5 ) and distal neurites ( 18 . 5 Â± 9 . 9 , n = 5 ) . Approximately 50 minutes later , there was swelling of the proximal end ( - 24 . 3 Â± 16 . 3 , n = 5 ) , and lamellipodium could be seen extending laterally from the swollen 59 compartment . After about 1 . 5 hours , the cut end of the proximal segment extended out ( + 12 . 7 Â± 9 . 8 , n = 5 ) and its lamellipodia branches made contact with the growing distal axon ( + 21 . 4 Â± 15 . 6 , n = 5 ) , which itself generated small lamellipodia ( Figure 12A ) . However , preliminary data from BCL 7 dsRNA treated cells , demonstrates a different restructuring of the neurite following injury . The BCL 7 dsRNA treated cells also showed a retraction of the proximal ( - 95 . 9 Â± 33 . 1 , n = 3 ) and distal ( - 157 . 3 Â± 34 . 5 , n = 3 ) cut ends 5 min after axotomy ( Figure 12B ) . In contrast to the control cells these neurons did not appear to form growth cones and as a result the proximal ( - 86 . 01 Â± 28 , n = 3 ) and distal ( - 167 . 4 Â± 69 . 9 , n = 3 ) ends were unable to successfully re - grow and regenerate their neurites after 1 . 5 hrs . Following axotomy , cultured Aplysia neurons form a specialized microtubule - based vesicle trap at the growth cone organizing center ( GCOC ) just proximal to the site of transection ( Erez et al . , 2007 ; Erez and Spira , 2008 ; Kamber et al . , 2009 ) . Microtubules depolymerize and repolymerize to form two microtubule based vesicle traps which sort and concentrate Golgi - derived vesicles that subsequently fuse with the plasma membrane and begin the formation of the growth cone ( Erez et al . , 2007 ) . In this study , axotomy of Lymnaea neurites results in growth cone formation and re - connection of the proximal and distal ends ( Figure 12A ) . Following knockdown of BCL 7 , however , our preliminary data shows that transected neurites did not successfully form growth cones ( Figure 12B ) . This suggests that BCL 7 may regulate microtubule dynamics in the injured neurite and impact proper growth cone formation , resulting in unsuccessful regeneration . Microtubules are assembled from tubulin heterodimers , which contain different Î± - tubulin and Î² - tubulin isoforms ( Lopata and Cleveland , 1987 ) . We used immunohistochemistry to examine the structure of Î² - tubulin in the control dsRNA and BCL 7 dsRNA treated cells . In control dsRNA treated cells , Î² - tubulin bundles were observed in the cut proximal and distal neurite as well as in the intact neurite . However , in BCL 7 knockdown neurons , the distribution of tubulin appeared to be segmented , and fragmentation of tubulin was observed ( Figure 13 ) . These results suggest that a decrease in BCL 7 expression may result in greater microtubule instability and more depolymerization , leading to the lack of growth cone formation and degeneration of the axon . 60 Figure 7 .

PPI - spider software was used to analyze their mammalian protein orthologues and identified 5 proteins potentially interacting and belonging to a common signaling pathway . These included band - 4 protein - 2 , phosphoinositide kinase , BCL 7 , protein phosphatase 1k , and Sec24 . In addition the software identified missing interactors which include calmodulin - 1 , SPARC - like protein 1 , BCL 6 , and bone sialoprotein . However , few of these genes have been previously implicated in CNS regeneration . In order to examine the specific role of these identified genes in regeneration we further analyzed the effects of BCL 7 and protein phosphatase 1k dsRNA knockdown on regeneration in vitro . Knockdown of protein phosphatase 1k in vitro , and mimicking the effects of CNS injury on its mRNA levels , resulted in no affects on neurite outgrowth and regeneration following axotomy . On the other hand knockdown of BCL 7 caused a reduction in the lengths of the proximal and distal neurites 24 hrs after axotomy . Furthermore live cell imaging of control dsRNA and BCL 7 dsRNA during the first hour following axotomy revealed that the BCL 7 dsRNA treated cells did not form proper growth cones as compared to control . BCL 7 may affect cytoskeletal dynamics and growth cone development and this may be mediated by CaM and the PPI spider proposed network . 4 . 3 . 1 Bioinformatic analysis of gene expression changes following CNS injury Protein - protein interaction ( PPI ) networks can be used for the interpretation of bioinformatics studies . PPI spider ( http : / / mips . gsf . de / proj / ppispider ) is a freely available web - based tool for inferring a network model from an experimentally identified protein list . Several studies have used this approach to interpret protein lists ( Martin et al . , 2008 ; Yue et al . , 2008 ) , and demonstrated that in most cases PPI spider can provide statistically significant hypotheses that are helpful for understanding protein lists ( Antonov et al . , 2009 ) . PPI spider uses a Global Network statistical framework to analyze protein list using a global protein - protein interaction network from IntAct , an open data molecular interaction database for 9 organisms , as reference knowledge ( Aranda et al . , 2010 ) . For the human genome , the reference network covers about 7960 genes involved in approximately 40 , 000 unique pairwise interactions . An experimentally 75 derived protein list is translated into a network model . PPI software takes into account that there may be missing proteins in the list , and automatically includes in the network model the most relevant proteins that are missing . The software provides a model of protein interactions that represent the most probable scenario of how proteins within the list are connected ( Antonov et al . , 2009 ) . Due to the limited transcriptome information available for the L . stagnalis , the PPI - software does not have a Lymnaea database . In order to bypass this limitation we generated a list for the mammalian protein orthologues of the 67 genes produced from our microarray study . The newly derived protein list was used as the input for the PPI - software ; the proposed network included 5 proteins identified from the microarray study , band - 4 protein - 2 , phosphoinositide kinase , BCL 7 , protein phosphatase 1k , and Sec24 . As well as missing interactor proteins which include calmodulin - 1 , SPARC - like protein 1 , BCL 6 , and bone sialoprotein . 4 . 3 . 1 . 1 Calmodulin The majority of the proteins in the proposed PPI spider network have not directly been implicated in CNS regeneration . However , some have been proposed to have an effect on neurite outgrowth . For example , CaM was identified as a missing interactor protein in the proposed PPI network and it has been shown to affect growth cone formation and neuronal elongation by a variety of pathways involving microtubules , kinases , phosphatases , or GTPases . CaM is an ubiquitously expressed calcium - binding protein that upon binding of calcium undergoes a large conformational change which allows it to bind to various CaM binding proteins ( CAMBP ` s ) ( Klee et al . , 1980 ) . Upon binding to CAMBPâs , CaM regulates neuronal outgrowth and growth cone turning by modulating microtubule dynamics . Specifically , CaM binds CRMP - 2 in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner resulting in an increase in the number and length of F - actin in the growth cone and promotion of neurite outgrowth ( Tateishi et al . , 1997 ; Stenmark et al . , 2007 ; Zhang et al . , 2009 ) . Contrastingly , CaM regulates GAP - 43 binding to F - actin by blocking actin polymerization in the CaM bound form , resulting in repulsion of the growth cone ( He et al . , 1997 ; Zakharov and Mosevitsky , 2007 ) . CaM also regulates cytoskeletal dynamics by regulating microtubule stability through interactions with MAPs ( Lee and Wolff , 1984 ) . Aside from cytoskeletal regulation , CaM may exert its effects on neurite outgrowth by affecting non - receptor tyrosine kinases . CaM binding to neural cell adhesion molecule ( NCAM ) , activates non - receptor tyrosine kinases fyn and fak to facilitate neurite outgrowth ( Kolkova et al . , 2000 ; Nakata et al . , 2005 ) . Upon activation of fyn and fak , there is nuclear translocation of a N - terminal fak 76 fragment , a C - terminal NCAM fragment and CaM , where the complex most likely associates with nuclear proteins to regulate gene expression and promote neurite outgrowth ( Kleene et al . , 2010 ) . CaM also activates a variety of calmodulin kinases ( CaMKs ) in order to regulate neurite elongation . Activation of CaMKIÎ± leads to axonal growth , whereas CaMKIÎ³ promotes dendritic outgrowth ( Neal et al . , 2010 ) . CaMKII and CaMIV have also been shown to be important in axon outgrowth ( Takemura et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2009 ) . In addition to activating various kinases , CaM also binds and activates calcineurin , a major Ca 2 + - calmodulin - dependent protein phosphatase in the brain ( Klee et al . , 1998 ) . Activated calcineurin has been reported to either stimulate or inhibit neurite outgrowth depending on the cell type ( Ferreira et al . , 1993 ; Chang et al . , 1995 ) . CaM regulation of axonal elongation and growth cone turning has been reported in a variety of pathways , as a result it is a critical component of the proposed PPI spider , which suggests a novel signaling cascade for CaM . 4 . 3 . 1 . 2 Phosphoinostide Kinases In addition to CaM , the proposed network identified a phosphoinositide kinase as part of the signaling cascade . Phosphoinositide kinases play a crucial role in signal transduction by transferring a phosphate to the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositols ( PtdIns ) , which then act as the precursors of several second - messenger molecules ( Fruman et al . , 1998 ) . Phosphoinositide kinases are categorized into three general families : phosphoinositide 3 - kinases ( PI3Ks ) , PtdIns 4 - kinases ( PtdIns4Ks ) , and PtdIns - P ( PIP ) kinases ( PIP5Ks ) . PI 3 - kinases have been implicated in numerous cellular activities including , neuronal survival , differentiation and motility ( Fruman et al . , 1998 ) . PI 3 - kinase is additionally required for neurite outgrowth and regeneration , and inhibition of PI 3 - kinase was shown to block the outgrowth of processes in PC12 cells , sensory , motor , and retinal neurons ( Kimura et al . , 1994 ; Lavie et al . , 1997 ; Kita et al . , 1998 ; Eickholt et al . , 2007 ) . Moreover , PI 3 - kinase inhibitors cause the retraction of previously extended neurites in PC12 cells and sensory neurons , suggesting that PI 3 - kinase is required not only for the initiation , but also the maintenance of neurites ( Sanchez et al . , 2001 ) . PtdIns 4 - kinases on the other hand play an important role in vesicle trafficking and lipid transport ( Balla and Balla , 2006 ) . At the plasma membrane PtdIns 4 - kinase regulate the synthesis of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 which recruit several signaling proteins , such as adaptors for endocytosis and proteins that are involved in actin polymerization ( Balla and Balla , 2006 ) . Lastly , PIP5Ks produce PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 which play a role in cell adhesion , secretion , endocytosis , and neurite 77 remodelling through actin cytoskeletal reorganization ( Pike , 1992 ; Honda et al . , 1999 ) . Phosphoinositide kinases are important components of signal transduction and generate vital second - messenger molecules ( PtdIns ) , consequently they are critical elements in the PPI spider pathway . 4 . 3 . 1 . 3 B - Cell Lymphoma The third group of proteins identified in the proposed signaling cascade are the B - Cell Lymphoma genes . B - Cell Lymphoma 6 ( BCL 6 ) is a transcription factor whose abnormal expression has been implicated in the tumorigenesis of non - Hodgkin lymphoma . It functions as a transcription repressor important for regulating lymphoid development . It is highly expressed in B - and T - cells , and is essential for germinal center formation and antibody responses by regulating T H 2 - type inflammation ( Halstead et al . , 2010 ) . BCL 6 â / â mice have a high rate of T H 2 - mediated hyperimmune disease and die at an early age ( Ye et al . , 1997 ) . In macrophages and B - cells , BCL 6 represses chemokine gene transcription and attenuates the inflammatory response ( Toney et al . , 2000 ; Shaffer et al . , 2000 ) . However , its expression is not exclusive to immune cells ; it has been detected in most tissues and cell types where it exerts mostly anti - inflammatory effects ( Takata et al . , 2008 ) . BCL 6 expression has been associated with terminal differentiation , and it has been proposed as anti - apoptotic protein in mouse myocytes ( Kumagai et al . , 1999 ) . In other non - immune cells , however , BCL 6 over - expression induced apoptosis via down - regulation of Bcl - 2 and Bcl - X L ( Yamochi et al . , 1999 ) and delayed S phase progression ( Albagli et al . , 1999 ) , suggesting that its effect on cell survival or death is cell type specific . In contrast to BCL 6 , the function of BCL 7 is unknown . The gene for BCL 7 is deleted in the neurodevelopmental disorder Williams Syndrome , suggesting that it may be involved in early development ( Zani et al . , 1996 ; Jadayel et al . , 1998 ) . The B - cell lymphoma genes have not been implicated in neuronal outgrowth previously ; consequently the PPI spider suggests a novel role for these genes in regeneration . 4 . 3 . 1 . 4 SPARC - like protein 1 SPARC - like protein 1 ( SC1 ) was also suggested as a missing interactor protein in the PPI spider network . SC1 is a member of the SPARC ( Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine ) family of extracellular matrix - associated proteins with a highly acidic domain I , a follistatin - like domain , and an extracellular calcium binding domain ( Brekken and Sage , 2000 ) . SC1 is 78 expressed in the developing as well as the adult CNS . In the adult rodent brain SC1 , co - localizes with the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) ( McKinnon and Margolskee , 1996 ) . Additionally , SC1 was found to localize to synapses , particularly the postsynaptic terminal as well as the perisynaptic glial processes that surround synapses ( Lively et al . , 2007 ) . Following brain injury , SC1 is rapidly up - regulated in reactive astrocytes around the site of injury ( McKinnon and Margolskee , 1996 ; Lively et al . , 2007 ) . This suggests that SC1 could be an important modulator of CNS injury and regeneration , possibly through the novel PPI spider pathway . 4 . 3 . 1 . 5 Protein phosphatase 1k Protein phosphorylation / dephosphorylation is a major regulatory mechanism of cellular function , such as cell signal transduction . Protein phosphatase 2C ( PP2C ) is one of four major protein serine / threonine phosphatases ( PP1 , PP2A , PP2B and PP2C ) ( Barford , 1996 ; Barford et al . , 1998 ) . It is distinguished from other groups of phosphatases by its requirement for divalent cations ( Mg2 + or Mn2 + ) and insensitivity to the okadaic acid ( Barford , 1996 ; Barford et al . , 1998 ) . Protein phosphatase 1k is novel PP2C isoform , and it was suggested to be part of the proposed PPI signaling network . Protein phosphatase 1k is targeted exclusively to the mitochondria matrix via a mitochondrial targeting sequence at its N - terminus ( Joshi et al . , 2007 ) . Protein phosphatase 1k is an essential protein for cellular survival and mitochondria permeability transition pore ( MPTP ) regulation as demonstrated by both in vivo and in vitro studies . Loss of protein phosphatase 1k expression leads to cell death and MPTP opening in response to calcium overload as well as developmental defects in the CNS of zebrafish ( Lu et al . , 2007 ) . This evidence suggests protein phosphatase 1k plays a critical role regulating cell death and development , and PPI spider proposes a novel role for this gene in CNS injury . 4 . 3 . 1 . 6 Sec24 transport protein and bone sialoprotein Lastly , PPI spider identified Sec24 transport protein and bone sialoprotein as components of the novel signaling cascade . Bone sialoprotein is a secreted bone matrix protein involved in bone metabolism , known to be expressed by macrophages and regulate calcification of necrotic tissue ( Hirota et al . , 1995 ; Wu et al . , 1995 ) . Recently , a role for this protein in protecting cells from hypoxia , by reducing the intracellular Ca 2 + was demonstrated in vitro ( Denhardt et al . , 1995 ) . The deposition of bone sialoprotein was observed in swollen and calcified axons at the outer edges of 79 a cerebral ischemic lesion , particularly in the process of axonal calcification ( Gupta et al . , 2010 ) . The role of bone sialoprotein deposition in swollen and calcified axons remains unknown , however it is speculated that its ability to modulate Ca 2 + secretion may be important for its function during axon calcification . Sec 24 on the other hand , is part of COP - II dependent intracellular vesicle transport . COPII vesicle assembly is initiated by a transmembrane protein within the ER membrane , Sec12 , which catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange on the small GTPase Sar1 ( Nakano and Muramatsu , 1989 ) . Activated Sar1p - GTP recruits the Sec23 / 24p complex by binding to Sec23p , and the cytoplasmically exposed signal of the transmembrane cargo is captured by direct contact with Sec24p to form a prebudding complex ( Kuehn et al . , 1998 ; Bi et al . , 2002 ) . The prebudding complex then recruits Sec13 / 31p onto Sec23 / 24p , which then polymerizes the prebudding complexes to form COPII vesicles ( Antonny and Schekman , 2001 ) . The growth of dendrites and axons involves coordinated cytoskeletal reorganization and membrane trafficking through this intracellular secretory pathway ( Lecuit and Pilot , 2003 ; Ye et al . , 2007 ) . Consequently Sec 24 has already been demonstrated to play an important role in neurite outgrowth and development by targeting GABA transporter - 1 ( GAT1 ) to the axon terminal ( Reiterer et al . , 2008 ) . Bone sialoprotein and Sec24 have been implicated in regulating axonal integrit , PPI - spider suggests a novel role for these genes following CNS injury in a common signaling pathway . We used PPI spider to interpret our microarray data and generated a novel signaling cascade . From the proposed signaling pathway we identified several genes with known functions in neurite outgrowth and regeneration as well as genes with no identified roles in axonal elongation . The PPI spider software provided us with a novel approach to analyze our gene list in terms of a global interaction network . We used the suggested pathway to select two genes , protein phosphatase 1k and BCL7 , and examine their roles in regeneration in more detail . 4 . 3 . 2 Suppression of protein phosphatase 1k does not affect neurite dynamics following axotomy Protein phosphatase 1k is new member of the Ser / Thr protein phosphatase from the PP2C family , specifically targeted to the mitochondria ( Joshi et al . , 2007 ) . The expression of protein phosphatase 1k is highest in the brain and heart . However , both the mRNA and protein levels are significantly reduced in hypertrophied and failing heart ( Lu et al . , 2007 ) . Additionally , reduced expression in the zebrafish leads to induced apoptosis and defects in CNS development . The 80 induction of cell death in these models was associated with dissipated mitochondrial membrane potential ( MPTP ) , suggesting that protein phosphatase 1k is essential for cell survival by maintaining MPTP ( Lu et al . , 2007 ) . Protein phosphatase 1k mRNA expression was also reduced in the L . stagnalis 3 hrs after CNS injury . Time - dependent analysis of gene expression revealed that this early down - regulation of protein phosphatase 1k mRNA quickly recovers to control levels by 5 hrs . These data suggest that protein phosphatase 1k expression is highly associated with metabolic status , and its loss of expression correlates with CNS injury and the progression of cardiac dysfunction . The L . stagnalis CNS is able to undergo successful regeneration after injury and the recovery of protein phosphatase 1k mRNA levels reflects this capability . Furthermore , phosphorylation is an important mechanism for regulating mitochondrial processes ( Pagliarini and Dixon , 2006 ) . There is evidence for the potential phosphorylation of many proteins in the mitochondria including BCL 2 , therefore phosphatases must exist in the mitochondrial membrane for their dephosphorylation ( Bassik et al . , 2004 ) . BCL 2 levels have been correlated with enhanced axonal outgrowth ( Holm and Isacson , 1999 ) , and its function may be regulated by dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1k . Successful regeneration is a balance between neurite retraction and outgrowth and protein phosphatase 1k may be part of either of these two processes . However , reduction of protein phosphatase 1k mRNA levels in vitro , following axotomy of cultured PeA neurons , resulted in no change in neuronal elongation over 24 hrs . Even though the data suggests that protein phosphatase 1k does not have a role in regeneration there are caveats that should be considered . We used RNA interference to knockdown the expression of protein phosphatase 1k and test the role of protein phosphatase 1k on neurite outgrowth and regeneration . However , one limitation of this experiment is that dsRNA only reduces mRNA levels , and consequently if there is adequate protein already present and the turnover rate is slow we may not be able to see an effect . Furthermore , the ~ 40 % knockdown of protein phosphatase 1k mRNA may not be a sufficient reduction , and as a result no effect was observed . Currently our observations suggest that protein phosphatase 1k is not involved in neuronal retraction or outgrowth following axotomy , however further confirmation of this hypothesis is necessary . 4 . 3 . 3 BCL 7 regulates neurite elongation in a regenerative model Chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin ( Ig ) and T cell receptor ( TCR ) loci represent common cytogenetic abnormalities in lymphoid malignancies . These translocations 81 result in loss of regulation of proto - oncogenes adjacent to the breakpoints , which play important roles in lymphomagenesis ( Korsmeyer , 1992 ) . Molecular cloning of these breakpoints has led to the identification of several Burkitts Cell Lymphoma ( BCL ) gene families involved in the control of normal cell differentiation , proliferation and death . Among the affected genes is BCL 1 at 11q13 and encoding cyclin D1 protein ( Rosenberg et al . , 1991 ) . BCL 1 is transcriptionally silent in normal tissues , and expression of the protein promotes neoplastic cell proliferation by perpetuating the cell cycle transition from G 1 to S phase ( Baldin et al . , 1993 ) . BCL 2 is the most common translocation in human lymphoid malignancies ( Pezzella et al . , 1990 ) . The BCL 2 protein is associated with the mitochondria and has a well document role in preventing apoptosis in many cell types ( Yang and Korsmeyer , 1996 ) . The BCL 3 oncogene was first identified in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( Crossen , 1989 ; Ohno et al . , 1990 ) . BCL 3 is an atypical member of the inhibitor of NF - kappa B family proteins , because it functions as a co - activator of transcription ( Bours et al . , 1993 ) . The over - expression of BCL 3 in tumors results in increased cell proliferation by activation of the cyclin D1 promoter and inhibition of p53 activity ( Zamora et al . , 2010 ) . BCL 6 chromosomal translocation was identified in about 50 % of lymphomas ( Butler et al . , 2002 ) . BCL 6 is required for germinal center formation and T - helper - 2 â mediated responses ( Ye et al . , 1997 ) . However , it also induces apoptosis by regulating the expression of BCL - 2 and BCL - X L , apoptosis repressor genes ( Yamochi et al . , 1999 ) . Lastly , the BCL7 gene family was identified in a complex translocation seen in a Burkitt lymphoma cell line ( Zani et al . , 1996 ) . The roles of the BCL 7 family are unknown and the proteins lack any domains associated with known functions . Alignment of three mammalian BCL 7 proteins shows homology within the N - terminal 51 amino acids . Secondary structure prediction suggested an Î± - helix region followed by a Î² - strand structure . The conserved N - terminus region also contains four potential phosphorylation sites ( Jadayel et al . , 1998 ) . We demonstrated that the L . stagnalis EST clone also shares some homology with amino - terminal of the BCL 7 gene families from H . sapien , M . musculus , M . musculus , D . melanogaster , and C . elegans . The BCL 7 gene is expressed abundantly in most tissues , including the brain ( Jadayel et al . , 1998 ) . We confirmed this , and identified BCL 7 in our microarray screen following CNS injury in the L . stagnalis ; its expression was increased 5 hrs after injury . This suggested that BCL 7 may play a role in the regenerative process following CNS injury , and indeed knockdown of BCL 7 in vitro after axotomy resulted in a reduction of proximal and distal neurite lengths . Knockdown of BCL 7 did not appear to impair the retraction response following axotomy as seen in the control . However , 82 the proximal and distal neurites did not form proper growth cones and elongation was severely compromised within the first hour following transection . In vivo imaging following nerve injury has allowed researches to observe the dynamic events that take place at the injury site , revealing key details of axonal degeneration and regeneration ( Bareyre et al . , 2005 ; Kerschensteiner et al . , 2005 ) . Kerschensteiner et al . , labeled DRG neurons and monitored them over the course of several hours after injury . In the first half hour the proximal and distal segments underwent symmetrical degeneration . The distal fragment began proper Wallerian degeneration approximately 1 to 2 days after the injury . Whereas the proximal segment showed active re - growth as early as 6 hrs after injury ( Kerschensteiner et al . , 2005 ) . In this model , degeneration of the distal stump is required for regeneration of the proximal segment . However , in the simpler invertebrate models such as the C . elegans , the proximal and distal segments of the severed axon re - grow and re - connect . This prevents degeneration of the distal fragment and leads to recovery of neuronal function ( Yanik et al . , 2004 ) . A similar process was observed in Lymnaea during in vivo imaging of control dsRNA treated cells , whereby the proximal and distal fragment re - grew and connected ( Figure 12A ) . On the other hand , the BCL 7 dsRNA treated cells failed to regenerate their proximal and distal segments after axotomy ( Figure 12B ) , suggesting a role for this protein following neural injury . The distal neurite exhibited the most dramatic response , and minimal outgrowth was detected . Whereas , in the proximal neurite even though outgrowth was stunted in the knockdown cells , more elongation was observed . The difference in proximal and distal axon outgrowth has also been observed in the earthworm lateral giant axon ( Lyckman et al . , 1992 ) . This may be due to the fact that distal neurites are not connected to the soma and consequently the only source of proteins is via de novo protein synthesis . Evidence from isolated neuritic segments suggests that neurons are capable of protein synthesis for up to 5 days after axotomy ( Spira et al . , 1996 ) . Additionally , isolated axons of Lymnaea are able to synthesize proteins when foreign mRNA is injected into axons lacking their somatas ( van et al . , 1997 ) . Furthermore , application of anisomycin , a protein synthesis inhibitor , disrupts axonal rejoining in Aplysia sensory neurons following injury ( Bedi and Glanzman , 2001 ) . These facts suggest that in our study the survival and outgrowth from the distal segment was indeed mediated by local protein synthesis . Alternatively , the proximal neurite is still connected to the soma , and axotomy results in retrograde signaling to the nucleus and gene transcription ( Funakoshi et al . , 1993 ; Gumy et al . , 83 2010 ) . Consequently , BCL 7 is continuously being produced in the proximal segment and a less dramatic change is seen on neurite outgrowth compared to the distal segment , which has finite mRNA available . Nevertheless this is the first evidence to suggest that BCL 7 has a role in neurite outgrowth after axotomy . The only proposed role for BCL 7 is in development . Currently there are only two lines of evidence that suggest the BCL7 gene family may be involved in early development . First , both human and the D . melanogaster BCL 7 genes have been detected in early embryo and blastocyst cDNA libraries . Second , BCL 7 is commonly deleted in Williams Syndrome ( Jadayel et al . , 1998 ) . Williams syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by cardiovascular problems , hypertension , dental abnormalities , hernias and mental retardation ( Morris et al . , 1988 ) . Due to the limited functional information on BCL 7 we wish to further study the mechanisms underlying its role in neurite outgrowth . Cytoskeletal dynamics are a central component of neurite outgrowth and it is important to determine if BCL 7 is involved in modulating actin and Î² - tubulin integrity . We employed immunocytochemistry and stained for Î² - tubulin ( Figure 13 ) . The similar methodology will be used in the future to compare Î² - tubulin and actin expression patterns and localization in control and BCL 7 knockdown cells to determine whether BCL7 regulates Î² - tubulin and / or actin dynamics . 4 . 3 . 4 Role of BCL 7 in calcium transients following axotomy After an axon is transected there is a sudden increase in intracellular calcium concentration due to the influx of calcium ions through the damaged membrane , the opening of voltage - gated calcium channels , inversion of the Na + / Ca 2 + exchanger , or intracellular stores { Ziv , 1997 285 / id ; Mandolesi , 2004 286 / id } . This increase in calcium has a major role in growth cone re - formation and axon regeneration after injury { Spira , 2001 287 / id } . Studies suggest that the key elements in the cellular cascades that lead to the growth cone formation are specifically activated by a transient increase in calcium at the injury site . In addition , the structural changes at the cut tip only occur after the intracellular calcium has returned to its original level { Ziv , 1997 285 / id ; Spira , 1993 288 / id } . Preliminary data in BCL 7 knockdown cells suggests that calcium influx at the injury site is not appropriately buffered after axotomy . The calcium signal in the axon fluctuates over the course of the ten minutes and the axon is unable to properly regulate the intracellular calcium levels . In the growth cone calcium signals can differ in amplitude , spatial 84 spread and kinetics and as a result have varied behavioral effect ( Gomez and Zheng , 2006 ) . Consequently , a minor change in spatial and temporal axonal intracellular calcium may activate a completely different signaling cascade , possibly one involved in degeneration . Furthermore , somal calcium concentration transients are also key indicators of transected cell fate and a large increase in somal calcium triggers apoptosis ( Nguyen et al . , 2005 ) . Our preliminary data shows that BCL 7 knockdown cells exhibited a larger increase in somal calcium concentration as compared to control , which may have initiated a degenerative response and resulted in the BCL 7 knockdown phenotype that we observed ( Figure 14 ) . It is crucial in future studies to validate the effects of BCL 7 on intracellular calcium and / or Ca 2 + / CaM dependent signaling pathway . 85 Figure 14 .

Following the resealing of the ruptured membrane ( 100 s ) , the [ Ca 2 + ] i recovers to near control levels , however the BCL 7 treated neuron displayed fluctuating [ Ca 2 + ] i , and the soma had a greater influx of calcium as compared to control . ( In collaboration with Dr . Alex J . Smith ) 86 Figure 14 87 5 . Conclusion This is the first microarray study in L . stagnalis , allowing us to identify genes that are differentially regulated following CNS injury . These genes may be involved in regeneration and provide a new database for the study of specific molecules in response to CNS trauma . I selected several potential genes and analyzed their time - dependent gene expression changes following CNS injury and employed RNAi knockdown to elucidate the role of these genes on regeneration . Through this method I identified the role of the transcription factor C / EBP in neuronal regeneration following axotomy of adult neurons in vitro . We also took advantage of the gene expression study and applied PPI - spider software to analyze the 67 candidate genes identified from the microarray . Five gene products that were suggested to be potentially interacting in a novel signaling network , including band - 4 protein - 2 , phosphoinositide kinase , BCL7 , protein phosphatase 1k , and Sec24 . I also provided the first evidence that BCL 7 plays a role in neurite regeneration . BCL 7 may exert this function by regulating growth cone dynamics through a Ca 2 + / CaM dependent pathway . Enhancing the intrinsic potential of neurons has been shown to favour a pro - regenerative response ( Curinga and Smith , 2008 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ) . Improving proximal and distal neurite outgrowth is important for the fate of axonal regeneration and re - establishment of proper functional connections . Following axonal injury in the proximal neurite retrograde signals trigger a local response at the growth cone , promoting growth cone retraction and extension , and a long distance response at the nucleus , regulating gene transcription . This study suggests a novel role for BCL 7 in regulating local growth cone dynamics as well the transcriptional regulation of growth promoting factors by C / EBP ( Figure 16 ) . In the distal neurite local protein synthesis increases after axonal injury and plays an important role in the regenerative process ( Willis and Twiss , 2006 ; Wang et al . , 2010 ) . Our study provides the first evidence that local regulation of C / EBP mRNA and BCL 7 mRNA in axons is important for outgrowth and regeneration in the L . Stagnalis ( Figure 16 ) . The CNS is a highly integrated and complex biological system . In order for successful regeneration to occur after injury , numerous molecular pathways need to work together in a coordinated manner . The damaged axons must be able to form and extend their growth cone , 88 navigate to appropriate targets and form functional synapses . Individual genes and proteins play roles in several of these mechanisms ; however , only the synchronized actions of these pathways can induce effective regeneration . Understanding the basic mechanisms that underlie this complex response to injury remains a challenge for researches nonetheless it is a pre - requisite for developing appropriate and effective therapeutic strategies . 6 . Future Directions The present study examines early gene expression following CNS injury in the L . stagnalis . The study provides evidence that siRNA silencing of C / EBP inhibits regrowth of the distal axon . In order to strengthen this conclusion additional experiments should be conducted . In the study only one type of C / EBP siRNA was employed . In order to confirm the observed effect multiple C / EBP siRNAâs should be applied following axotomy and the outgrowth of the distal and proximal neurite measured . This would further validate the effects of C / EBP on the distal neurite . The use of one siRNA and the partial ( 60 % ) knockdown of C / EBP could also reflect the lack of an effect on the proximal neurite after injury . In order to determine if C / EBP actually plays a role in the proximal neurite a more effective knockdown needs to be established , likewise , neurite regeneration can be measure in a C / EBP knockout animal . It is also critical to demonstrate whether the failure of growth from the distal stump after silencing of C / EBP has a consequence for regeneration in a more complete nerve regeneration model . For example , using organ - cultured CNS as a regenerative model in the L . stagnalis and backfilling the regenerating axons with a retrograde tracer . This will demonstrate if C / EBP is indeed a critical factor for successful regeneration . The study also reveals a novel role for BCL 7 in L . stagnalis CNS regeneration . Knockdown of BCL 7 using dsRNA resulted in reduced neurite outgrowth from both the proximal and distal neurites . In order to confirm that these effects are valid multiple dsRNAâs and siRNAâs should be applied after injury . A similar approach should be applied to the protein phosphatase 1k experiments . Protein phosphatase 1k knockdown did not appear to affect neurite outgrowth following axotomy , however this may be due to the partial knockdown of protein phosphatase 1k and the results would be further validated by applying different dsRNA and siRNAâs . Furthermore , BCL 7 and protein phosphatase 1k are only partial 89 sequences , cloning the full length gene would confirm that these ESTâs are indeed the identified Lymnaea proteins . BCL 7 silencing appeared to inhibit growth cone formation potentially by regulating the cytoskeleton . In order to determine if silencing BCL 7 causes deregulation of cytoskeletal dynamics immunocytchemistry can be performed . Immunolabelling with antibodies to Î² - tubulin and actin can be used to compare the cytoskeletal profile in regenerating control and BCL 7 knockdown neurons . Furthermore , co - immunopercipitation can be carried out to determine if BCL 7 interacts directly with actin or tubulin . The process of axonal regeneration is a dynamic event involving degeneration and regeneration of the injured axon . The mechanisms of degeneration involve activation of NAD - consuming resulting in NAD decrease and NAD effector inactivation ( Wang et al . , 2005 ) . This leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP depletion , followed by Ca 2 + influx and calpain activation , microtubule fragmentation and degradation of neurofilaments and membrane proteins ( Yan et al . , 2010 ) . We identified C / EBP and BCL 7 as two genes that play a role in neurite outgrowth following axotomy in Lymnaea . However , it is not clear whether these genes are involved in regeneration or degeneration of the axon . In order to determine which process BCL 7 and C / EBP are involved in , an approach that may be used is to inhibit regeneration and measure the rate of degeneration after axotomy . For example , anisomycin , a protein synthesis inhibitor and inhibitor of regeneration , can be applied to the injured cells and the rates of degeneration can be measure in C / EBP or BCL 7 knockdown cells and compared to control cells . If the rate of degeneration is greater in the knockdown cells this will suggest that the gene of interest may play a role in inhibiting degeneration . Whereas if there is no difference in the rates of degeneration it suggests the gene plays a role in the regeneration process . 90 Figure 15 .

( In collaboration with Nasrin Nejatbakhsh and Andrew Barszczyk ) 91 Figure 15 92 Figure 16 . Schematic illustrating local and global effects of axotomy Following axotomy retrograde signals trigger a local response at the growth cone and a long distance response at the nucleus , regulating gene transcription . In the proximal neurite , C / EBP functions as a transcription factor and results in the transcription of regenerative - associated genes , such as Î² - tubulin and GAP - 43 , via a cAMP / PKA / CREB dependent signaling pathway ( Nadeau et al . , 2005 ) . Axon injury also activates an ERK - dependent pathway that results in the phosphorylation of C / EBP and further activation of pro - regenerative genes ( Sung et al . , 2001 ) . At the growth cone of the proximal neurite BCL 7 may regulate cytosokeletal dynamics through a Ca 2 + / CaM dependent mechanism to promote neurite outgrowth . In the distal end local protein synthesis increases after axonal injury and plays an important role in the regenerative process ( Willis and Twiss , 2006 ; Wang et al . , 2010 ) . In the distal neurite the DLK - 1 pathway regulates C / EBP mRNA stability following axotomy ( Yan et al . , 2009 ) . Local regulation and protein synthesis of C / EBP mRNA and BCL 7 mRNA in distal neurites is important for outgrowth . 93 Figure 16 94 References Aboobaker , A .
