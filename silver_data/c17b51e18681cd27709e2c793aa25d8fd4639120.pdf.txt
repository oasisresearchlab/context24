Higgins Abby L . Wilson Brian D . Fell University of Louisville Although the research on software piracy is growing , criminologists have not examined the role of deterrence in software piracy . Using data collected from 382 undergraduate students attending a southeastern university , this study examined the role of deterrence in reducing instances of software piracy using a factorial design . The findings from the analysis showed that certainty and not severity was important in reducing software piracy . The study also found that contemporary parts of deterrence theory ( i . e . , shame and family discovery ) were important in deterring software piracy . Policy implications of these findings are discussed . Keywords : deterrence theory ; software piracy ; factorial design INTRODUCTION Recently , the personal computer became an important instrument for individuals’ daily lives ( Sieber , 1998 ) . Just as personal computer use has increased , so has use of the computer for criminal and deviant activity ( Hinduja , 2003 ) . One form of computer crime is software piracy . Sims , Cheng , and Teegan ( 1996 ) defined software piracy as the illegal copying of computer software . Others ( Britz , 2004 ; Straub & Collins , 1990 ) broadened the definition to the unauthorized copying , distributing , or downloading of copyrighted material . To date , the research on software piracy comes from business , information technology , and , more recently , the fields of criminal justice and criminology . However , the collective understanding of deterring and reducing this behavior has not been thoroughly developed . The behavior was so pervasive that one industry account suggested that 39 % of all software on computers throughout the world are pirated copies ( Business Software Alliance [ BSA ] , 2003 ) . With the continued growth and reliance on personal computers , software piracy and the deterrence of software piracy have become areas of concern for industry groups , law enforcement , and criminal justice scholars . However , our understanding of this behavior from the perspective of deterrence is not complete . Our current knowledge about deterring software piracy comes almost exclusively from the information technology literature ( Gopal & Sanders , 1997 ; Peace , Gellatta , & Thong , 2003 ) . Sherizen ( 1995 ) advocated that computer crime , including software piracy , should be examined using contemporary deterrence theory measures that include : ( a ) crime control factors ( i . e . , 167 / JCJPC 12 ( 3 ) , 2005 certainty and severity of sanctions ) , ( b ) risk and profit factors ( e . g . , previous behavioral activities ) , ( c ) individual factors ( e . g . , low self - control , shame , guilt , and moral beliefs ) , and ( d ) crime opportunities ( i . e . , opportunity cost considerations ) . These deterrence factors outlined by Sherizen ( 1995 ) were consistent with the majority of mainstream deterrence theory studies ( e . g . , Paternoster , 1987 ; Yu & Liska , 1993 ) , which have been critical of our understanding of how to reduce criminal behavior . We agree with Sherizen ( 1995 ) , that the research aimed at deterring software piracy should include these factors . In our view , the existing literature lacks clear contributions for examining these factors in such a way that might help develop a usable knowledge base for reducing instances of software piracy . The goal of the present study was to contribute to the literature by examining the effect of deterrence measures on software piracy . This was the third study to examine such a link . The strength of this study came from applying criminology’s updated version of deterrence theory ( Grasmick & Bursik , 1990 ; Nagin & Paternoster , 1993 ; Pogarsky , 2002 ; Tibbetts , 1997 ) to computer crime ( i . e . , software piracy ) as Sherizen ( 1995 ) recommended . It was our belief that the information learned from this contribution could be applied to the software piracy problem . To make this contribution , the study first presents the scope of the software piracy problem . Second , the study explores the link between software piracy and college students . Third , the study presents deterrence theory and its literature . Fourth , the study presents the methods that were used in this study and the results of our analyses . Fifth , and finally , the study presents conclusions drawn from the results and the policy implications they provide . Scope of the Software Piracy Problem Computer software is the product of intellectual endeavors that combine creative ideas and talents from different individuals or groups ( e . g . , programmers , writers , and graphic artists ) and shares the same protections under copyright laws as other works of intellectual property such as books , films , and music . As such , software piracy has been illegal since passage of the 1980 Computer Software Act , an amendment of the 1976 Copyright Act . Sims et al . ( 1996 ) defined software piracy as the illegal copying of computer software . The amendment specified that individuals and institutions ( e . g . , colleges or universities and employees ) can be held liable for software piracy , even if the individual unintentionally pirated the software ( Im & Koen , 1990 ) . Punishments arising from software piracy include prison time of up to 5 years and maximum fines of $ 500 , 000 ( Koen & Im , 1997 ) . Economically , software piracy has resulted in the loss of substantial revenue by the software industry and society . The BSA ( 2003 ) reported that software piracy has accounted for an annual $ 11 - 12 billion of loss . Shin , Gopal , Sanders , and Whinston ( 2004 ) estimated that this was an increase from 1995 of more than 50 % of the revenues for the software industry . The BSA ( 2003 ) estimated that in 2002 the software industry lost $ 13 billion . During this same time , software piracy took more than 105 , 000 jobs , more than $ 5 . 3 billion in wages , and more than $ 1 . 4 billion in tax revenue . Due to the pervasiveness of the act , the computer industry has developed trade organizations ( e . g . , the BSA and Software Information Industry Association ) to combat the 168 / JCJPC 12 ( 3 ) , 2005 practice of software piracy . These organizations have typically used research , lobbying , lawsuits , and educational tactics to increase public awareness of the problem . Importantly , these organizations have published estimates of software piracy from different countries around the world . In 2003 , research from the BSA estimated that , globally , 39 % of all new software had been pirated . In the same report , the BSA estimated that the software piracy rate was 22 % in the United States . Government officials are also combating software piracy . Specifically , DeFrances ( 2002 ) showed that software piracy cases were prosecuted by a little over 2 % of all prosecutor offices . While this may seem small , 54 % of large prosecutor offices ( i . e . , prosecutor offices that serve more than 1 , 000 , 000 individuals ) prosecuted software piracy . However , DeFrances also showed that , for offices of smaller sizes , a steep decline in the prosecution of software piracy cases existed . However , prosecutions declined in these cases due to a lack of resources and not a difference in the value of prosecuting software piracy cases . Nevertheless , DeFrances showed that the government was paying attention to this form of crime and was attempting to combat it through prosecution . Therefore , software piracy is an important emerging crime that criminologists need to research . Specifically , given that software piracy can lead to prison sentences and / or fines , that it is actively being prosecuted , and that it has several different layers of financial costs , the behavior is a substantial problem in need of deterrence . Sherizen ( 1995 ) remarked that : there is a need for information security [ criminal justice practitioners ] to determine how best to change the existing perceptions . . . regarding the risks of getting caught in computer crime activities [ including software piracy ] as well as the perceived payoffs of such activities . ( p 179 ) However , a necessary issue in deterring piracy is to determine the most likely software pirates . Software Piracy and College Students College students regularly use computers for personal and school - related purposes . In order to reduce the occurrence of software piracy , it is therefore important to understand that the behavior persists among college students ( Hinduja , 2001 , 2003 ; Hollinger , 1988 ; Husted , 2000 ) . A nationwide trade organization survey of students ( n = 1 , 000 ) found that 89 % of students did not pay for the software they used ( BSA , 2003 ) . Early and contemporary software piracy research attempted to profile the collegiate software pirate . Such research indicated that college students are ripe for software piracy because : ( a ) they were never told what was and was not expected of them with respect to hardware and software use , ( b ) they were not acquainted with the law , and ( c ) they were generally confronted with ethical issues ( Cook , 1986 , 1987 ) . The BSA ( 2003 ) supported most of these views from Cook ( 1986 , 1987 ) , and showed that most students did not believe that current university policies about unlicensed software were effective . Hinduja ( 2003 ) also supported the view of Cook ( 1986 , 1987 ) that college students were faced with ethical issues and decisions , and suggested that software pirates were likely to participate in other forms of unethical behavior 169 / JCJPC 12 ( 3 ) , 2005 such as academic dishonesty . Contemporary research has identified the likely software pirate as a male in his 20s majoring in the liberal arts and who frequently uses a computer ( Hinduja , 2001 , 2003 ; Hollinger , 1988 ; Husted , 2000 ; Sims et al . , 1996 ) . College students provide some unique issues that warrant the investigation of software piracy . First , college students’ software piracy could result in financial costs and negative publicity for colleges and universities . Second , software piracy could be a gateway offense for other forms of computer crime ( e . g . , cyber stalking or identity theft ) or other criminal behavior ( Hinduja , 2003 ) . Hinduja ( 2003 ) pointed out that these issues suggest the importance of studying software piracy among college students in order to bring about the development of policies to reduce its occurrence . Theoretical Perspective The main theoretical perspective used by the criminal justice system to reduce instances of criminal and deviant behavior is deterrence theory . That is , deterrence theory was designed to control criminal behavior ( i . e . , gain compliance to the law ; Tyler & Huo , 2002 ) . Deterrence theory suggests this takes place by identifying , discovering , and properly penalizing individuals who are currently performing criminal behaviors . On the other hand , the criminal justice system threatens individuals not currently performing criminal behaviors with legal sanctions ( i . e . , the certainty and severity of punishment ) in order to control crime . At this point , it is important to note that there are two forms of deterrence theory— classical and contemporary . Classical deterrence theory assumes that individuals are rational beings . That is , the theory assumes that individuals will perform behaviors they perceive as pleasurable or beneficial and avoid behaviors they perceive as painful or costly . Central to the increase in cost perception is an individual’s belief that his or her criminal behavior will be detected ( i . e . , certainty ) , will be harshly punished ( i . e . , severity ) , and that discovery and detection will occur quickly ( i . e . , swiftness ) . Thus , in classical deterrence theory , when the threat of punishment is perceived to be certain , severe , and swift , the perceived cost of a criminal behavior becomes increased , triggering caution in the individual that could result in the individual refraining from performing the behavior and thereby deterring and reducing crime . To date , existing empirical research has not provided complete support for the classical model of deterrence theory . In particular , two meta - analyses showed that the threat of certainty , rather than severity , has more support ( Paternoster , 1987 ; Yu & Liska , 1993 ) . Importantly , these two meta - analyses considered studies that used retrospective accounts , perceptual research ( i . e . , research that involves scenarios ) , and longitudinal research . Additional research found corroborating evidence from these meta - analyses ( Grasmick & Bursik , 1990 ; Nagin , 1998 ; Nagin & Paternoster , 1991 ; Piquero & Pogarsky , 2002 ; Pogarsky , 2002 ) . By demonstrating that certainty rather than severity was the most important deterrent measure , the research has suggested that classical deterrence theory is not a complete enough model to understand what deters individuals from crime . Contemporary deterrence theory recognized the problems with classical deterrence theory , and suggested modifications to the theory through the addition of other measures that 170 / JCJPC 12 ( 3 ) , 2005 represent inhibitions and motivations for crime . For instance , Grasmick and Bursik ( 1990 ) suggested that the inclusion of conscience measures ( i . e . , shame , guilt , and embarrassment ) would add to our understanding of how to deter individuals from crime . Specifically , Grasmisk and Bursik suggested that an understanding of the level of self - disapproval would demonstrate inhibitory effects on criminal behavior , because of the self - stigmatizing implications they provide . Several studies have shown that shame is a more consistent self - stigma measure than guilt ( Blackwell , Grasmick , & Cochran , 1994 ; Grasmick , Blackwell , & Bursik , 1993 ; Grasmick , Bursik , & Kinsey , 1991 ; Piquero & Tibbetts , 1996 ; Tibbetts , 1997 ; Tibbetts & Myers , 1999 ) . However , other research has shown that guilt is also a promising self - disapproval and self - stigmatizing measure that may reduce criminal behavior ( Nagin & Pogarsky , 2003 , 2004 ; Pogarsky , 2002 , 2004 ) . Others have contributed to the literature by using measures to examine whether an individual’s moralistic view of a behavior may be an inhibiting factor in deterrence theory . Bachman , Paternoster , and Ward ( 1992 ) argued that believing a behavior to be morally wrong may be an inhibiting factor in the decision - making process . On the other hand , individuals that did not believe a behavior was morally wrong would need the threat of other sanctions to inhibit the behavior . This view of moral beliefs has found support in the deterrence literature ( Paternoster , 1987 ; Paternoster & Simpson , 1996 ; Piquero & Tibbetts , 1996 ; Pogarsky , 2002 , 2004 ; Tibbetts , 1997 ) . In addition to the criminological deterrence literature , the software piracy literature has also shown that individuals are likely to perform a behavior when they believe the behavior to be ethical rather than unethical ( Higgins , 2005 ; Wagner & Sanders , 2001 ) . Grasmick and Bursik ( 1990 ) argued that social disapproval is an important inhibiting factor for behavior within the deterrence perspective . For instance , they suggested that the possibility of admired , trusted , or close individuals ( e . g . , family and friends ) discovering criminal behavior might function as punishment that could vary in certainty and severity . In other words , discovery of the act embarrasses the actor . Research has shown that when this form of discovery and embarrassment are anticipated or occur on a state level ( i . e . , situational level ) then this type of embarrassment could inhibit or deter the individual from performing the behavior ( Pogarsky , 2002 ) . This view has yet to be extended to software piracy . Some have developed motivational components for criminal behavior in deterrence theory . For instance , Nagin and Paternoster ( 1991 ) showed that individuals who had performed a behavior previously were likely to perform the behavior again in the future , because previous performance of the behavior reduced the effectiveness of inhibitions . Under this view , an individual’s personality traits changed to where the prior criminal activity increased the likelihood of future criminal activity . This theoretical basis , as well as previous research , has suggested that past behavior holds important information for deterrence research ( Cochran , Wood , Sellers , Wilkerson , & Chamlin , 1998 ; Nagin & Pogarsky , 2003 , 2004 ; Paternoster , 1986 ; Paternoster & Piquero , 1995 ) . In the software piracy literature , previous research has shown that prior software pirating behavior increases the likelihood of future software pirating behavior ( Higgins & Makin , 2004a , 2004b ) . Another motivating measure for criminal behavior includes Gottfredson and Hirschi’s ( 1990 ) version of low self - control . Specifically , Gottfredson and Hirschi argued that low self - 171 / JCJPC 12 ( 3 ) , 2005 control is the inability of the individual to resist a temptation toward criminal behavior when an opportunity for it exists . The self - control literature , as well as most of criminology , assumes that individuals with low self - control are likely to participate in risky , impulsive , and nonempathic behaviors , because the behaviors satisfy an individual’s desire for thrilling and immediately gratifying behaviors . The self - control theory literature has shown that low self - control is indeed an important measure ( Nagin & Paternoster , 1993 ; Piquero & Tibbetts , 1996 ; Tibbetts , 1997 ; Tibbetts & Myers , 1999 ) . In addition , recent software piracy research has also shown that low self - control is an important element in understanding software piracy ( Higgins , 2005 ; Higgins & Makin , 2004a , 2004b ) . An additional motivating factor in deterrence research is the role of peer association . Akers ( 1998 ) demonstrated that deviant or criminal peer association creates a social learning process that increases the likelihood or inclination for criminal behavior . Deterrence research has not overlooked this link between peer association and criminal behavior . Pogarsky ( 2002 ) showed that , in deterrence theory , there is a link between peer association and intentions to drive drunk . In addition , research has also shown there to be a link between peer association and software piracy ( Christensen & Eining , 1991 ; Higgins & Makin , 2004b ; Skinner & Fream , 1997 ) . Although Sherizen ( 1995 ) called for criminologists to specifically test the contemporary form of deterrence theory using forms of computer crime that include software piracy , the only tests of deterrence theory and software piracy are found in the information technology literature . Gopal and Sanders ( 1997 ) used deterrence theory to examine factors that may reduce software piracy and increase profits . They found that certainty would increase the perception of costs and increase industry profits . An additional study by Peace et al . ( 2003 ) examined deterrence theory . However , the Peace et al . study examined the mediating effect attitudes and subjective norms ( i . e . , the favorable perception that significant others would encourage the behavior ) would have for perceived certainty and severity on intentions to pirate software . The study showed that perceived certainty and severity were indeed mediated by attitudes and subjective norms . While these studies are important , they provide limited knowledge about how deterrence theory could be applied to software piracy . Specifically , the studies did not explicitly use the classical parts of deterrence theory and only fragmentally used parts of contemporary deterrence theory . Therefore , a gap in the literature exists concerning the role of deterrence theory in reducing software piracy . The Present Study The purpose of the present study was to address a gap in the literature by presenting the first systematic examination of deterrence theory in the context of software piracy . This research contributes to both the deterrence theory literature and the software piracy literature . Regarding the deterrence theory literature , the present study went beyond previous research by examining software piracy . Regarding the software piracy literature , the present study was the first effort to apply criminology’s version of deterrence theory to this phenomenon . That is , the present study adds to the literature by explicitly making use of the classical parts of deterrence theory and bringing together its contemporary parts . While this was the third effort to use deterrence theory in the software piracy context , our effort contributed to both sets of literature in important and 172 / JCJPC 12 ( 3 ) , 2005 complementary ways by performing an original study . Beyond these contributions , the present study also provided college administrators and other policy - makers with important information they could use to reduce instances of software piracy . METHOD Sample After Institutional Review Board and Human Subject Protection review , data for this analysis were collected during the fall 2004 semester . Specifically , the researchers gave a self - report questionnaire to college students at a southeastern university in the United States . The students were from different majors enrolled in two courses that were open to all majors , and four courses that were only open to justice administration majors . The researchers asked students who were present on the day the questionnaire was administered to take part in the study during the class period . The researchers told the students of the voluntary nature of the study , and that all responses were anonymous and confidential . This set of procedures produced 386 surveys . However , after listwise deletion for missing cases , only 382 completed surveys remained for analysis . The median age of the sample was 20 years , with a range from 18 to 40 . Fifty - six percent of the sample were female ( n = 212 ) , and the remaining 44 . 5 % ( n = 170 ) were male . The sample was 17 . 7 % ( n = 68 ) nonwhite and 81 . 3 % ( n = 314 ) white . The use of a student sample in some studies of deterrence theory may be problematic , because the students may not perform the types of crimes being studied ( Wright , Caspi , Moffitt , & Paternoster , 2004 ) . However , in the present study college students were indeed the proper sample , because previous research has shown that this group of individuals frequently performs acts of software piracy ( Hinduja , 2001 , 2003 ; Hollinger , 1988 ; Husted , 2000 ) . Factorial Design The factorial design approach combined the strengths of both experiments and probability sampling . That is , it allowed the researchers to develop unique qualities about a given situation without forcing the researchers to tax their respondents ( Rossi & Nock , 1982 ) . In the present study , there were four possible unique combinations ( i . e . , factors ) derived from certainty and severity in the software piracy vignette . Using a vignette format , each student would have to rate all four of the combinations to determine the independent effects of the measures , which would not be very efficient . The factorial design allowed the researchers to infer to this population by randomly assigning the vignettes and the factors to the students . Random assignment for this study was achieved by using a random numbers table . Important features of our study were the development of a believable scenario , as well as certainty and severity factors . We developed these pieces of our survey in two ways . First , we were informed through the literature review about the measures . Second , we developed our measures through administering a 30 - item semi - structured survey , in a pilot study , to a small sample ( n = 30 ) of students ( the target population ) that were not included in the final sample . Two points of emphasis were made in the semi - structured survey : ( a ) the hypothetical scenario and ( b ) the extra - legal sanctions . Students were asked to rate the believability of 10 scenarios and 173 / JCJPC 12 ( 3 ) , 2005 the factors to be included in the study on an 11 - point scale that ranged from not believable to 100 % believable . The students were also asked to provide information concerning the different factors to be included in the scenarios . We were concerned about including the proper levels of each factor in the scenarios so as to not depart too far from the perceptual nature of deterrence theory . The students were asked to rate their perception of the certainty that they would be caught performing the scenarios . The students marked their perception of the certainty of being caught on an 11 - point scale that ranged from not being caught at all to 100 % chance of being caught . In addition , the students were asked to rate their perception of the severity of the sentences that they would receive if they were caught . The students marked their perception of the severity of offense on an 11 - point scale with the following categories : ( a ) “no fine , ” ( b ) “500 dollar fine , ” ( c ) “1 , 000 dollar fine , ” ( d ) “10 , 000 dollar fine , ” ( e ) “no jail or fine , ” ( f ) “1 month jail time , ” ( g ) “3 months jail time , ” ( h ) “6 months jail time , ” ( i ) “one year jail time , ” ( j ) “three years jail time , ” and ( k ) “five years jail time . ” These categories were in accordance with a range of possible punishment severities taken from current legislation concerning software piracy . We then chose to use the most believable survey from this pilot group . That is , 75 % of the students ( n = 23 ) in the pilot study marked that the following scenario was at least 95 % believable : You are taking a class that requires a lot of computer homework . The class is important to your success in your major because other classes use the same material , so you want to learn the material and make a good grade in the class . You have all of the computer programs that you need for the class EXCEPT for one . So , you go to the bookstore to purchase the software ; however , you cannot afford it . Others in the class have told you that they own the program and would be willing to burn a copy for you . We then chose to use a range of responses to develop the certainty and severity factors that would be randomly assigned in the scenarios for the students . The pilot study revealed that a range from 20 - 80 % certainty contained 90 % ( n = 27 ) of the students’ responses about the certainty of being caught for software piracy . The responses from the pilot study revealed that 70 % of the students ( n = 21 ) provided responses that ranged between a $ 500 fine and spending 3 months in jail . From the pilot study , in our view , we were left with a partially student - generated ( i . e . , target - population - generated ) scenario and set of factors . We chose to minimize the complexity of the survey and to use the end points of our ranges as the factors . This resulted in a 2 ( certainty levels ) X 2 ( severity levels ) factorial design . We recognize that some may not concur with our method of selecting the scenario and factors for our study . They could argue that our certainty and severity measures reduce variation in the perception of these measures . However , we felt this procedure was similar to Bouffard’s ( 2002 ) suggestions for participant - generated information for rational choice and deterrence studies . Therefore , we believed the scenario was relevant to this population . 1 In addition , we felt we had identified a reasonable set of factors that could be varied among the sample for the present study . 174 / JCJPC 12 ( 3 ) , 2005 Dependent measure . Similar to previous deterrence research ( e . g . , Pogarsky , 2002 ) , the dependent measure for this study was the students’ response to a single item , “What is the likelihood that you would take the software under these circumstances ? ” 2 The students marked their responses on an 11 - point scale that was anchored by the responses not likely and 100 % likely . Higher scores on the item reflected a greater likelihood they would perform the act . Low self - control . The measure of low self - control used in the present study was the 24 - item composite scale from Grasmick , Tittle , Bursik , & Arneklev ( 1993 ) . Response categories for the scale ranged from 1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree . Higher scores signaled lower levels of self - control . This scale had an internal consistency of . 83 , and factor analysis with a scree test showed the scale to be unidimensional , a finding similar to other deterrence and rational choice studies ( see Nagin & Paternoster , 1993 ; Piquero & Tibbetts , 1996 ) . Extra - legal sanctions . The social - and self - disapproval measures used in the present research were alike . To measure the expected influence of social - disapproval similar to Grasmick and Bursik ( 1990 ) , the students were asked two questions : “How likely is it that your family would find out that you used a copy of the program in the circumstances described in the scenario ? ” and “How likely is it that your friends would find out that you used a copy of the program in the circumstances described in the scenario ? ” The students addressed these questions using an 11 - point scale anchored by not likely and likely . To measure the expected influence of self - disapproval , the students were asked , similar to Pogarsky ( 2002 ) , “How likely would you feel guilty if you were to use the copy of the program in the circumstances described in the scenario ? ” and , similar to Paternoster and Piquero ( 1995 ) , “How likely would you feel shame if you were to use the copy of the program in the circumstances described in the scenario ? ” The students addressed these questions using an 11 - point scale that was anchored by not likely and 100 % likely . In addition , as in Bachman et al . ( 1992 ) , the students addressed the following question : “How morally wrong would it be if you were to use the copy of the program in the circumstances described in the scenario ? ” The students answered this question using an 11 - point scale anchored by not wrong and 100 % wrong . Additional control measures . The students responded to additional control measures that included their self - reports of the number of times they had pirated software before and their percentage friends who had pirated software before , as well as their gender ( 0 = male , 1 = female ) , race ( 1 = white , 0 = nonwhite ) , and age ( an open - ended item ) . RESULTS Table 1 presents descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations for the measures . Not shown in the table is that the distribution of the dependent measure ( intentions to pirate software ) was not overly skewed ( - . 75 ) and did not contain a substantial number of zero responses ( 10 % ; n = 38 ) . To be sure the correct analysis was presented , Tobit and Ordinary Least Squares ( OLS ) regressions were performed and compared . Although not shown , we performed Tobit regression because some deterrence studies ( Paternoster & Piquero , 1995 ; Pogarsky , 2002 ) used this technique due to substantial zero responses in the dependent measure . The results from the Tobit regression were substantively the same as the OLS , without any changes in direction of the coefficients . Therefore , we decided to present only the correlational analysis and OLS results . 175 / JCJPC 12 ( 3 ) , 2005 Table 1 Sample Descriptive Statistics and Bivariate Correlations of Measures ( n = 369 ) Mean SD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 1 .

Table 1 shows correlations among the measures . The associations between moral beliefs and guilt ( r = . 67 ) , moral beliefs and shame ( r = . 65 ) , moral beliefs and family discovery ( r = . 60 ) , guilt and family discovery ( r = . 65 ) , family discovery and shame ( r = . 67 ) , friend discovery 177 / JCJPC 12 ( 3 ) , 2005 and shame ( r = . 62 ) , and family and friend discovery ( r = . 67 ) were all equal to or greater than . 60 , while the association between guilt and shame ( r = . 75 ) had the largest association . The strength of these associations suggested that multicollinearity may have been an issue in these data , and variance inflation factors ( VIFs ) and tolerance coefficients from OLS were necessary for this analysis . From the classical deterrence theory measures , certainty had a significant negative association , albeit weak , with software piracy ( r = - . 12 ) , but severity did not have a significant association with software piracy ( r = . 06 ) . This supported the findings of previous deterrence theory research ( e . g . , Paternoster , 1987 ; Yu & Liska , 1993 ) . Table 2 presents results from the OLS regression analysis that applied classical and contemporary deterrence theory measures to software piracy . These results showed that six measures accounted for 38 % of the variance in software piracy . Specifically , the results provided mixed support for the classical deterrence theory perspective , finding that certainty ( b = - . 68 , B = - . 10 , t = - 2 . 44 ) but not severity ( b = . 10 , B = . 02 , t = 0 . 38 ) had a negative link with software piracy . Shame also had a negative link with software piracy ( b = - . 24 , B = - . 23 , t = - 1 . 97 ) , supporting part of the self - disapproval view from contemporary deterrence theory . In addition , the results supported another part of contemporary deterrence theory , showing that family discovery had a negative link ( b = - . 15 , B = - . 14 , t = - 2 . 12 ) with software piracy . Gender also had a negative link with software piracy ( b = - 1 . 11 , B = - . 17 , t = - 3 . 75 ) , which supported the demographic contention from the software piracy literature that males are significantly different from females with respect to software piracy . That is , females were less likely than males to pirate software . On the other hand , peer association had a positive link ( b = . 06 , B = . 15 , t = 3 . 44 ) with software piracy , supporting the view that this sort of association might motivate the behavior . The view that individuals sought thrills and behaved on impulses that benefited themselves was also supported in the results , with a significant link between low self - control and software piracy ( b = . 06 , B = . 15 , t = 3 . 22 ) . The bivariate correlation analysis suggested that multicollinearity could have been an issue with these data , but the regression analysis did not provide evidence of multicollinearity through the use of VIFs and tolerance . Typically , researchers have viewed VIFs above four and tolerance coefficients below . 20 as problematic ( Field , 2000 ) . In our analysis , none of the VIFs were above two and none of the tolerance measures approached or were below . 20 . DISCUSSION The purpose of the present study was to address gaps in the literature by presenting the first systematic examination of how deterrence theory can reduce instances of software piracy . In this study , the certainty and severity levels were experimentally manipulated and randomly assigned to students . The results show that certainty had a significantly negative link with software piracy . This finding is consistent with a substantial amount of classical deterrence theory literature ( Paternoster , 1987 ; Piquero & Pogarsky , 2002 ; Pogarsky , 2002 ; Sherizen , 1995 ; Yu & Liska , 1993 ) . This suggests that as certainty increases software piracy decreases , and that the public and private sectors need to develop teams that can more accurately research and implement security measures . 178 / JCJPC 12 ( 3 ) , 2005 Severity was not an important deterrent in these data , which is also consistent with the literature ( Paternoster , 1987 ) . However , this could be due to our measure of severity . While we attempted to allow the participants to provide the most cogent measure of certainty , our method was not without its faults . On the other hand , this result is consistent with previous deterrence theory literature ( e . g . , Paternoster , 1987 ; Pogarsky , 2002 ; Sherizen , 1995 ) . Therefore , we conclude that the deterrent effect from certainty may be more important in reducing software piracy than severity . In addition to classical deterrence theory measures , the results which show that shame may inhibit software piracy is consistent with previous research ( Grasmick , Blackwell , et al . , 1993 ; Grasmick et al . , 1991 ; Piquero & Tibbetts , 1996 ; Tibbetts , 1997 ; Tibbetts & Myers , 1999 ) . This measure found shame to be an important self - conscious emotion which may provide a sense of self - disapproval and self - stigma that an individual may find undesirable with respect to software piracy . Further , the results show that family disapproval had a significant negative link with software piracy . This result supports previous deterrence theory research ( Grasmick & Bursik , 1990 ) . Importantly , the result suggests that social disapproval from the family may provide a sense of social stigma that could produce inhibitions toward software piracy . An important link is present in these data concerning the gender of the individual . Our finding that males are more likely to be software pirates supports previous research ( Hinduja , 2001 , 2003 ) . This could suggest that a gender gap exists in this form of offending that deserves the attention of future research . Also important are the links that low self - control and peer association have with software piracy . Our results support the contention from Gottfredson and Hirschi ( 1990 ) and other empirical research ( Higgins , 2005 ; Higgins & Makin , 2004a , 2004b ) that temptation is too much for an individual with low self - control to resist . In addition , the link between peer association and software piracy is consistent with the previous literature ( Akers , 1998 ; Higgins , 2005 ; Higgins & Makin , 2004a , 2004b ) . Furthermore , findings of the current study provide several policy implications for three specific areas : ( a ) law enforcement , ( b ) legislative , and ( c ) organizational . Law enforcement needs to develop proper procedures to detect and investigate these cases to increase the certainty of apprehension . Educational institutions can assist law enforcement if a law is passed that requires them to report every violation . In addition , prosecutor offices need to be trained , equipped , and funded properly , which may occur legislatively , to prosecute software piracy . Organizationally , educational institutions can provide orientation sessions to make students aware of the certainty of software piracy apprehension . In addition , the training process may emphasize the shame that could arise from the detection and prosecution of software piracy . This training may indicate the social embarrassment felt when an offender’s family is notified of software piracy infringements and the penalties that come with such criminal behavior . In addition , educational institutions may provide “pop - ups” on students’ computers that remind users of these issues after the orientation sessions . At a minimum , educational institutions can provide students with written literature about issues pertaining to software piracy . In essence , we believe there is a culture that thinks software piracy is proper behavior , but if educational 179 / JCJPC 12 ( 3 ) , 2005 institutions can change this climate to emphasize the criminogenic issues surrounding software piracy , then the behavior may be reduced . While the present study has found support for various parts of classical and contemporary deterrence theory , the study has limits . First , our measure of severity may have had too little variance for this analysis , which is a limit among factorial surveys of this type . However , while this is a limit , it is not a fatal flaw , partly because we performed a pilot study to allow the participants to somewhat generate the severity and certainty measures in order to preserve some perceptual qualities of the sanctions . Second , the data for this study come from a cross - sectional sample from one university in the southeast , possibly restricting generalizability of the results . However , software piracy is prevalent among students from this type of university . Third , the study only makes use of one software piracy scenario . Despite its limitations , the present study provides evidence that some parts of classical and contemporary deterrence theory may be used to reduce instances of software piracy . In particular , the study shows that certainty , shame , and family disapproval may be important for reducing instances of software piracy . Further , the study shows that association with peers who pirate software and low self - control are important covariates of software piracy . Future studies that expand the number of scenarios , use different college campuses , and manipulate important emotional components of deterrence will be very useful in understanding how deterrence can reduce software piracy . For now , the present study supports our view , as well as that of Sherizen ( 1995 ) , that the deterrence theory perspective may be used to reduce instances of computer crime—specifically software piracy . NOTES 1 . The use of scenarios in examining deterrence and rational choice theories has become rather routine ( Klepper & Nagin , 1989 ; Piquero & Tibbetts , 1996 ; Tibbetts & Gibson , 2002 ) . However , some may argue that this technique may not allow for adequate examination of crime theories ( Tibbetts & Gibson , 2002 ) . On the other hand , software piracy scholars such as Shore et al . ( 2001 ) have implied that software piracy is a behavior that has subtle complexities that can best be captured using scenarios . In fact , Shore et al . implied that using direct measures of software piracy is likely to result in minimum variation and may be inflated with zeros . In addition , this technique has been successfully used in previous tests that link crime theories to software piracy ( Higgins , 2005 ; Higgins & Makin , 2004a , 2004b ) . 2 .
