Asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection in Belgian long - term care facilities As of July 1 , Belgium has 61 509 con - firmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) infection and 9754 related deaths . In early April , the ministry of health decided to implement a mass testing campaign in long - term care facilities ( LTCFs ; appendix p 1 ) . 1 Tests were distributed by regional authorities , giving priority to facilities with a higher number of suspected cases . Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from residents and staff and sent for real - time PCR testing in preselected laboratories across the country . Sample identi - fication numbers were registered online together with age , sex , and symptom status at the time of testing . Symptom status was determined by the medical professional taking the swab ( appendix p 1 ) . We did a cross - sectional analysis of data received from the laboratories between April 8 , and May 18 , 2020 ( full description in appendix p 1 ) . 280 427 people were tested , including 142 100 ( 51 % ) residents and 138 327 ( 49 % ) staff . Median age was 42 years ( IQR 31 – 52 ) for staff and 85 years ( 72 – 90 ) for residents . Data were reported for 2074 LTCFs ( of the total 2500 that were invited to participate ) , with a median of 181 tests ( IQR 124 – 266 ) per facility . 8343 ( 3·0 % ) people tested positive , including 2953 ( 2·1 % ) staff and 5390 ( 3·8 % ) residents . When adjusted for the group category ( ie , staff or resident ) and age group , the odds of testing positive were higher for women than for men ( odds ratio 1·2 , 95 % CI 1·1 – 1·2 ) and for people who were symptomatic than for those who were asymptomatic ( 8·5 , 8·0 – 9·0 ) . No symptoms were reported for 6244 ( 74·8 % , 95 % CI 73·9 – 75·8 ) of 8343 people who tested positive , including 2185 ( 74·0 % , 72·4 – 75·6 ) staff and 4059 ( 75·3 % , 74·1 – 76·5 ) residents . The proportion of residents and staff who were asymptomatic by age group is shown in the appendix ( p 2 ) . This analysis of a large number of tests done in LTCFs shows a high proportion of asymptomatic cases . The proportion of SARS - CoV - 2 infections that were asymptomatic ranged from 20 % to 88 % of the tested population in previous studies . 2 , 3 Given the cross - sectional nature of this analysis we were unable to determine whether any of the asymptomatic individuals went on to develop symptoms . Proportions reported therefore comprise both pre - symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 cases . Risk of underascertainment of symptoms , although mitigated by the medical assessment , persists . Similar viral loads have been reported between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases , 4 , 5 making the transmission and spread of the virus possible for both groups .
