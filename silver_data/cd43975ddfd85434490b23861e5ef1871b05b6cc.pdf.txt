The spore coat is a polarized extracellular matrix composed of glycoproteins and cellulose . The process of spore coat formation begins by the regulated secretion of spore coat proteins from the prespore vesicles ( PSVs ) . Four of the major spore coat proteins ( SP96 , PsB / SP85 , SP70 and SP60 ) exist as a preassembled multiprotein complex within the PSVs . This complete complex has an endogenous cellulose - binding activity . Mutant strains lacking either the SP96 or SP70 proteins produce partial complexes that do not have cellulose - binding activity , while mutants lacking SP60 produce a partial complex that retains this activity . Using a combination of immunoﬂuorescence microscopy and biochemical methods we now show that the lack of cellulose - binding activity in the SP96 and SP70 mutants results in abnormally assembled spore coats and spores with greatly reduced viability . In contrast , the SP60 mutant , in which the PsB complex retains its cellulose - binding activity , produces spores with apparently unaltered structure and viability . Thus , it is the loss of the cellulose - binding activity of the PsB complex , rather than the mere loss of individual spore coat proteins , that results in compromised spore coat structure . These results support the idea that the cellulose - binding activity associated with the complete PsB complex plays an active role in the assembly of the spore coat .

The spore coat protects the encased dormant amoeba from a variety of harmful environmental stresses , including temperature and des - iccation . This protection allows the spores to remain viable for extended periods of time in unfavourable conditions and thus provides a substantial evolutionary advantage to the organism . The spore coat of the mature spores is a tri - lamellar , polarized structure and has been studied by electron microscopic as well as biochemical methods . The outer layer of the spore coat is composed of loosely associated 0002 - 3952 # 2000 SGM 1829 Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Fri , 11 Jan 2019 16 : 02 : 26 S . SRINIVASAN and OTHERS proteins , the middle layer contains cellulose and the inner layer of the spore coat is composed of proteins that are bound covalently to the coat ( Devine et al . , 1982 ; Hemmes et al . , 1972 ; Orlowski & Loomis , 1979 ) . A layer of galactose - N - acetylgalactosamine - containing mucopolysaccharide ( GPS ) lies just proximal to the plasma membrane of the underlying dormant amoeba ( Erdos & West , 1989 ) . A multiprotein complex called the PsB complex is found within the spore coat of mature spores and spans the three layers of the spore coat . The PsB complex is made up of four major glycoproteins , SP96 , PsB } SP85 , SP70 and SP60 , which are held together by both covalent and non - covalent bonds ( Watson et al . , 1993 ) . The proteins of the complex are expressed during the slug stage of de - velopment and accumulate in this preassembled form in prespore vesicles ( PSVs ) ( Devine et al . , 1983 ; Watson et al . , 1994 ) . At the ﬁnal stage of spore diﬀerentiation , an unknown developmental signal induces the synchronous fusion of the PSVs with the plasma membrane followed by the subsequent secretion of the PsB complex , as well as other uncomplexed spore coat proteins which are stored in the PSVs . One such glycoprotein is SP75 , which is not part of the preassembled PsB complex in the PSVs , but is subsequently assembled into the spore coat upon secretion ( Watson et al . , 1994 ) . Analysis by immuno - ﬂuorescent staining with mAbs has shown that the PsB glycoprotein complex becomes part of both the spore coat and the interspore matrix which can be visualized as a phase - dense material between mature spores ( Watson et al . , 1994 ) . The PsB complex has an endogenous cellulose - binding activity , a function which correlates well with its localization to the cellulose - rich spore coats ( McGuire , 1996 ; McGuire & Alexander , 1996 ) . Using a series of mutants lacking diﬀerent proteins of the PsB complex ( Fosnaugh et al . , 1994 ) , we established the relative order of assembly of the proteins into the complex and showed that a fully assembled PsB complex is required for cellulose - binding activity ( McGuire & Alexander , 1996 ) . Speciﬁcally , we found that SP96 was anchored to the complex through SP70 , which in turn was bound to PsB . The abrogation of either SP96 or SP70 resulted in the assembly of partial complexes ( containing either SP70 } PsB } SP60 or SP96 } PsB } SP60 , respectively ) which did not have cellulose - binding activity . SP60 is anchored to the complex through PsB , but interestingly , its absence has no eﬀect on the cellulose - binding activity of the partial complex containing SP96 } SP70 } PsB . The cellulose - binding activity of the PsB complex suggested that this activity may be necessary for localization and proper assembly into the spore coat . Thus , we predicted that mutants which are defective in the cellulose - binding activity ( SP96 − and SP70 − ) will have an aberrant spore coat . To test this hypothesis , we examined the mutants for ( 1 ) spore coat protein localization , ( 2 ) spore coat structure and ( 3 ) viability of the mutant spores . The availability of several well characterized mAbs to the peptide and oligosaccharide epitopes of the diﬀerent proteins of the PsB complex has enabled us to address these questions ( Champion et al . , 1991 , 1995 ; Smith et al . , 1989 ) . In this report , using a combination of immuno - ﬂuorescence microscopy and biochemical methods , we show that in the cotA − ( SP96 − ) and cotB − ( SP70 − ) mutant strains , the partial PsB complexes which lack cellulose - binding activity are secreted and do localize to the spore coat . This suggests that assembly of all components of the complex and the associated cellulose - binding property are not a prerequisite for its routing , secretion and localization . However , in these mutants , the structure of the spore coat is altered and results in a dramatic loss of viability of the spores compared to their wild - type parent . On the other hand , the cotC − ( SP60 − ) mutant in which the partial PsB complex retains its cellulose - binding activity , produces spores with appar - ently normal structure . Thus the proper construction and assembly of the spore coat and the viability of the spores is directly correlated with the cellulose - binding activity of the PsB multiprotein complex . METHODS Strains and cell culture conditions . D . discoideum cells were grown in association with Klebsiella aerogenes on slime mould medium agar plates at 22 (cid:176) C ( Sussman , 1987 ) .

Table 1 sum - marizes the strains and their properties . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy . Wild - type and mutant spores were harvested 1 d after the ﬁrst appearances of spores . Spores were harvested and washed in lower pad solution ( LPS ; 20 mM KCl , 2 – 5 mM MgCl # , 40 mM potassium phosphate , pH 6 – 5 ) containing 0 – 5 mg streptomycin sulfate ml − " and then were either treated directly for immunoﬂuorescence micro - scopy or germinated before treatment ( Ennis & Sussman , 1975 ) . Untreated or germinated spores were allowed to settle and adhere to coverslips , ﬁxed with 3 – 7 % ( v } v ) formaldehyde in LPS , incubated for 3 – 5 min and washed for 10 min in LPS . Cells were permeabilized by incubating the coverslips with 0 – 5 % ( v } v ) Nonidet - P40 in LPS for 5 min , followed by three washes for 5 min each in LPS . Non - speciﬁc binding sites were blocked by incubation for 20 min in ﬁlter - sterilized 1 % ( w } v ) BSA ( Fraction V ; Sigma ) in LPS ( 80 l l per coverslip ) . Each coverslip was then incubated for 2 h with 80 l l of a 1 : 500 dilution of primary antibody in 1 % BSA } LPS . Table 2 summarizes the antibodies used in this study . Parallel negative controls were incubated in the same solution without the primary antibody . The coverslips were drained , washed three times with LPS and incubated for one hour with 80 l l of a 1 : 500 dilution of aﬃnity - puriﬁed rhodamine - conjugated goat - anti mouse immunoglobulin of the appropriate speciﬁcity ( Cappel } Organon Teknika ) in 1 % BSA } LPS . The coverslips were washed three times in LPS and were mounted onto slides ( cell side down ) in a solution of Airvol ( Air Products ) in LPS containing 50 mg DABCO ml − " ( 1 , 4 - diazabicyclo [ 2 . 2 . 2 ] - octane ) to prevent fading of the ﬂuorescence . All slides were examined and photographed with a Zeiss IM inverted microscope using a 100 ‹ Neoﬂuar lens . At least 100 spores were examined for each treatment . Extraction of spore coat proteins . Spores were washed sequentially in a series of four buﬀers to diﬀerentially extract the spore coat proteins .

Over 90 % of the extractable protein was found in the ﬁrst round and only the ﬁrst extracts are shown in the ﬁgures . One - day - old spores ( 1 ‹ 10 ( ) were collected from bacterially grown cells into 1 ml Tris buﬀer ( 10 mM Tris } HCl , pH 8 – 0 ) , with the freshly added protease inhibitors , 100 l M AEBSF [ 4 - ( 2 - aminoethyl ) benzenesulfonyl ﬂuoride } HCl ; Boehringer Mannheim ] and 3 l M E64c ( trans - epoxysuccinyl - l - leucylamido - 3 - methylbutane ; Sigma ) . The spores were pelleted for 2 min in a microcentrifuge at 14000 r . p . m . and the supernatant ( wash 1 ) was kept at 4 (cid:176) C for analysis . The spores were then resuspended in 1 ml Tris buﬀer containing 1 % SDS ( Tris } SDS ) , incubated for 5 min , pelleted and the supernatant ( wash 2 ) was kept . The spores were then boiled for 5 min in Tris } SDS before pelleting ( wash 3 ) and then ﬁnally boiled for 5 min in Tris } SDS buﬀer containing 5 % ( v } v ) 2 - mercaptoethanol ( wash 4 ) . For Western blot analysis , 20 l l of each wash was loaded per lane , equivalent to extracts from 2 ‹ 10 & spores . Sporeviability assays . Strains were mass - plated in association with Klebsiella aerogenes . Spores of each strain were tested for viability by two methods , according to a procedure adapted from Richardson & Loomis ( 1992 ) . In the ﬁrst test , spores were allowed to remain on stalks on slime mould medium plates at 22 (cid:176) C for the duration of the experiment ( 30 d ) . Spores were collected every 5 d , resuspended in 10 mM EDTA at 1 ‹ 10 & ml − " and incubated at 37 (cid:176) C for 30 min . Duplicate serial dilutions in Bonner’s standard solution } 5 mM EDTA were plated on slime mould medium plates in association with K . aerogenes . The number of plaques formed was counted and spore viability was expressed as the percentage of the number of plaques seen on day 1 of the experiment . In the second test , on day 1 spores were collected and resuspended to 1 ‹ 10 ) ml − " in 50 mM sodium phosphate , pH 6 – 4 , with 1 % antibiotic } antimycotic ( Gibco - BRL ) . The spore suspensions were then shaken at 22 (cid:176) C for the duration of the experiment ( 30 d ) . Viability was tested every 5 d as described above . Note that for the cotABC − strain , owing to a severe loss in viability , it was not possible to conduct the experiment for longer than 20 d . RESULTS Cot mutant strains lacking cellulose - binding activity have altered spore coats To test whether mutant strains lacking cellulose - binding activity had altered spore coat structure , we analysed the spore coats in wild - type and four cot mutant strains . The data are summarized schematically in Fig . 4 . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy . The localization of the spore coat components in the cot gene deletion mutant strains ( Table 1 ) was examined in intact and germinated spores by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy , using either the MUD3 or MUD102 mAbs , which recognize the SP96 and PsB proteins , respectively ( Table 2 ) . No ﬂuorescence was seen when either untreated or germinated spores were incubated with secondary antibody alone ( Fig . 1A – E , panels a ) . Parental strain HL328 .

The cotA − strain lacks the SP96 protein . As expected , no labelling with MUD3 was observed with either untreated ( Fig . 1B , c ) or germinated spores ( Fig . 1B , e ) . In contrast to the wild - type parental strain , some MUD102 ﬂuorescence was visible in intact , untreated spores ( Fig . 1B , g ) and stronger MUD102 ﬂuorescence was seen in germinated spores ( Fig . 1B , i ) . These data indicate that the partial PsB complex still localizes to the spore coat in the absence of SP96 . However , the PsB protein , which normally localizes to the inner layer of the coat is now exposed and available for recognition by MUD102 ( Fig . 4b ) . cotB deletion mutant ( SP70 ) . The cotB − strain lacks the SP70 protein . Although there are no mAbs available that speciﬁcally recognize this protein , the fate of other coat proteins can be followed in this strain . Previously , it has been shown that this protein mediates the association of SP96 ( cotA ) with the PsB protein because in cells lacking SP70 , SP96 is no longer associated with the complex ( McGuire & Alexander , 1996 ) . When cotB − spores were stained with MUD3 , strong ﬂuorescence 1833 Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Fri , 11 Jan 2019 16 : 02 : 26 S . SRINIVASAN and OTHERS could be seen on the surface of both ungerminated ( Fig . 1C , c ) and germinated spores ( Fig . 1C , e ) . These results indicate that SP96 is localized to the spore coat even when not in association with the rest of the PsB complex prior to secretion . The spores labelled with the MUD102 ﬂuoresced brightly , in both intact ( Fig . 1C , g ) and germinated spores ( Fig . 1C , i ) , demonstrating a clearly altered spore coat structure in mutants lacking SP70 where PsB is now available for binding to MUD102 in intact spores ( Fig . 4c ) . cotC deletion mutant ( SP60 ) . The cotC − strain lacks the SP60 protein . The absence of this protein does not aﬀect the assembly of the rest of the PsB complex or its cellulose - binding activity ( McGuire & Alexander , 1996 ) . As expected , MUD3 ﬂuorescence was observed in both the untreated ( Fig . 1D , c ) and germinated spores ( Fig . 1D , e ) , indicating that the localization of SP96 was not aﬀected by the loss of SP60 . MUD102 labelling was not visible on intact spores ( Fig . 1D , g ) but was bright on germinated spores ( Fig . 1D , i ) , indicating that spores lacking SP60 have a normal spore coat structure ( Fig . 4d ) . Interestingly , ungerminated immature spores in this sample did show some ﬂuorescence with MUD102 ( Fig . 1D , g ) , presumably because the coat is not yet completely matured , and suggests that development in this strain may be somewhat slower than the wild - type . cotABC deletion mutant ( SP96 , SP70 and SP60 ) . The cotABC − strain lacks the SP96 , SP70 and SP60 proteins . When spores from this strain were labelled with MUD3 , no ﬂuorescent signal was seen on either untreated ( Fig . 1E , c ) or germinated spores ( Fig . 1E , e ) . The MUD102 ﬂuorescence was very bright on intact spores ( Fig . 1E , g ) , though somewhat less bright on germinated spores ( Fig . 1E , i ) . This labelling conﬁrms that the PsB protein is still present and localized to the spore coat , but that the structure of the spore coat is greatly altered ( compare Figs 1A , g and 1E , g ) . Flow cytometry was performed on unﬁxed spores to conﬁrm the results obtained from the immuno - ﬂuorescence experiments , thus eliminating the possi - bility of ﬁxation artefacts . MUD3 staining showed that SP96 was present on the outer layer of the spore coat in wild - type , cotB − and cotC − spores and , as expected , was absent in spores from cotA − and cotABC − strains . PsB was exposed to the outside of the spores in the cotA − , cotB − and cotABC − strains , but not in the wild - type and cotC − spores ( data not shown ) . Biochemical extractions . The immunoﬂuorescent analysis showed that the structure of the spore coat was altered in mutants with partial PSB complexes which lack cellulose - binding activity . To determine whether these changes in coat structure were reﬂected at the bio - chemical level , we examined the structure of the spore coat in the parental strain HL328 and the four cot mutant strains by a series of extractions . The extracted proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE and analysed by Western blotting , using the mAbs MUD62 , MUD141 , MUD3 ( all recognizing SP96 ) and MUD102 ( recognizing PsB ) ( Table 2 and Fig . 2 ) . The biochemical data conﬁrm the results from immunoﬂuorescence experiments and show that spores from the cotA − , cotB − and cotABC − strains are altered , and that the spores from the cotC − strain are similar to the wild - type . Parental strain HL328 . The extractions of the parental strain produced results identical to those seen in a previous large - scale extraction of spores from the wild - type strain WS380B as assayed by Western analysis with mAbs MUD62 and MUD102 ( Watson et al . , 1994 ) . SP96 is found in all extracts when tested with MUD62 ( Watson et al . , 1994 ) , with the majority in the fraction extracted in hot SDS ( Fig . 2a ) . When the fractions were tested with the mAbs MUD3 or MUD141 , SP96 was detectable only in fraction 3 . This is most likely due to a considerably lower aﬃnity of these antibodies for SP96 compared to MUD62 . The PsB glycoprotein was ex - tracted in all washes , although it was most predominant in wash 4 ( Fig . 2a ) . This result indicates that the majority of PsB is covalently attached to the spore coat . Washes 1 and 2 remove the interspore matrix between spores and loosely associated proteins , respectively . The PsB found in washes 1 and 2 indicates the presence of the PsB complex in the interspore matrix , as observed previously ( Watson et al . , 1994 ) . It is important to note that the majority of SP96 ( wash 3 ) does not co - fractionate with the majority of the PsB protein ( wash 4 ) , although SP96 has been shown to be covalently linked to the PsB complex through disulﬁde bridges ( Watson et al . , 1993 ) . This observation suggests that SP96 is expressed in large excess over the other proteins in the PsB complex . This idea is supported by experiments in which labelled cell extracts that were depleted of the PsB multiprotein complex by sequential immunoprecipitations with MUD102 still contained free SP96 , as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation with MUD62 ( unpublished ) . cotA deletion mutant ( SP96 ) . SP96 , assayed by MUD62 , MUD3 or MUD141 , is missing from all the fractions ( Fig . 2b ) . PsB was found only in fraction 4 from this strain , conﬁrming that in the absence of SP96 , the partial PsB complex can still localize and be covalently bound to the spore coat . However , the distribution of PsB to the interspore matrix appears to depend on the presence of SP96 . cotB deletion mutant ( SP70 ) . In the absence of SP70 , SP96 does not associate with the PsB complex ( McGuire & Alexander , 1996 ) . The immunoﬂuorescence data indicated that SP96 is still incorporated into the spore coat in this mutant . However , staining with MUD141 and MUD3 show that the distribution of SP96 is altered in this mutant ( Fig . 2c ) . There was an increase in SP96 in fractions 1 and 2 in contrast to the parental strain HL328 ( compare Fig . 2a and 2c ) , because when SP70 is absent , SP96 is not bound to the PsB complex and therefore is extracted under milder conditions ( wash 1 ) . The PsB distribution was virtually identical to that observed in the parental strain . cotC deletion mutant ( SP60 ) . The distribution of SP96 in this strain is identical to the parental strain with almost 1834 Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Fri , 11 Jan 2019 16 : 02 : 26 Dictyostelium spore coat assembly 1 2 3 4 MUD62 1 2 3 4 MUD141 1 2 3 4 MUD3 1 2 3 4 MUD102 anti - PsB anti - SP96 SP96 SP75 ( a ) SP75 ( b ) SP96 SP75 ( c ) SP96 SP75 ( d ) SP75 ( e ) PsB PsB PsB PsB PsB . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

( b ) For each strain , spores were harvested on day 1 and were shaken at a density of 1 ‹ 10 8 ml − 1 in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 6 – 5 , at 22 (cid:176) C for 30 d . Every 5 d , spores were collected and resuspended to 1 ‹ 10 5 ml − 1 in 10 mM EDTA , incubated at 37 (cid:176) C for 30 min and duplicate serial dilutions were plated for viability as described in Methods . Spore viability is expressed as a percentage of the number of plaques seen on day 1 of the experiment . U , HL328 ; + , cotA − ; _ , cotB − ; E , cotC − ; t , cotABC − . Each point is a mean of duplicate determinations . all of SP96 in fraction 3 ( Fig . 2d ) . The pattern of MUD102 labelling was also identical to the parental strain . cotABC deletion mutant . The results with the triple mutant are identical to those seen with the cotA − strain , which also lacks SP96 ( Fig . 2e ) . Again , only fraction 4 contains the PsB protein . The SP75 glycoprotein is found in the spore coat of mature spores , but is not a component of the pre - assembled PsB complex ( Watson et al . , 1994 ; West et al . , 1996 ) . It is recognized by the mAb MUD62 and in all strains tested , SP75 is extracted predominantly in the fourth wash ( Fig . 2a – e ) . It is therefore cross - linked normally into the coat in the diﬀerent cot mutants . Spores with partial PsB complexes have lower viability The immunoﬂuorescence and biochemical extraction experiments described so far demonstrate a change in the structure of the spore coat in the cotA − , cotB − and cotABC − strains . No alteration was seen with the cotC − strain when compared to the parental strain . These data are in accord with our observation that only the cotC − strain produces a partial PsB multiprotein complex that still retains cellulose - binding activity ( McGuire & Alexander , 1996 ) . Since proper spore coat assembly and structure are crucial to the survival of the organism , we predicted that there would be a loss of spore viability in mutants where the spore coats were altered . To test this , spores from the wild - type parent and the four mutant strains were tested for their viability over a period of 30 d . In the ﬁrst test , spores were allowed to remain on stalks at 22 (cid:176) C for the duration of the experiment and their viability was tested every 5 d as described in Methods . The data are presented in Fig . 3 ( a ) . The wild - type parent showed no loss of viability over 30 d . The most dramatic eﬀects were seen in the cotA − and cotABC − strains , where a 1300 - and 3750 - fold loss in viability was observed , respectively . The cotB − strain showed an 18 - fold reduction in viability . How - ever , only a threefold decrease in viability was seen in the cotC − mutant spores . In the second test , spores were submerged in buﬀer at a density of 1 ‹ 10 ) ml − " on day 1 , were kept shaking at 22 (cid:176) C for 30 d and were sampled every 5 d . Although the wild - type parent again showed no loss of viability over the period tested , a more severe eﬀect was seen in all mutant strains , as shown in Fig . 3 ( b ) . The cotA − and the cotABC − strains showed a 5000 - and 8500 - fold loss in viability , respectively . The cotB − strain showed an 180 - fold reduction in viability and again the cotC − strain showed a much lower 10 - fold reduction in viability . DISCUSSION The assembly of the spore coat is the ultimate step in the development of D . discoideum ( Srinivasan et al . , 2000 ) . Proper construction of this complex ECM aﬀords the enclosed dormant amoeba protection from the environ - ment . Previous biochemical and transmission electron microscopic studies have deﬁned several spore coat components , including glycoproteins and cellulose , which are assembled into a highly organized , polar , tri - lamellar structure ( Devine et al . , 1982 ; Hemmes et al . , 1972 ; West & Erdos , 1990 ) . However , scanning electron microscopic techniques have revealed little more about the ﬁne structure and mechanism of assembly of the coat ( Hohl & Hamamoto , 1969 ; Muhlethaler , 1956 ) .

Fig . 4 . Model for the role of the PsB multiprotein complex cellulose - binding activity in the assembly of the D . discoideum spore coat . ( a ) Parental strain , HL328 . The complete PsB complex has cellulose - binding activity which results in a properly organized impermeable spore coat . Only proteins of the PsB complex which are on the outside of the intact spores are accessible to antibodies , giving rise to the staining patterns seen in Fig . 1A . PsB is on the inside of the coat and the MUD102 antibody cannot access PsB in ungerminated spores , thus there is no staining . ( b ) cotA − mutant . The partial PsB complex does not have cellulose - binding activity and results in an improperly assembled coat which is now permeable to the antibody MUD102 and results in the staining pattern seen in Fig . 1B . ( c ) cotB − mutant . The partial PsB complex does not have cellulose - binding activity and results in an improperly assembled coat which is now permeable to the antibody MUD102 and results in the staining pattern seen in Fig . 1C . Note that the free SP96 is localized in the coat . ( d ) cotC − mutant . The partial PsB complex has normal cellulose - binding activity which results in an intact spore which is stained with antibodies ( Fig . 1D ) like the wild - type parent . We propose that the cellulose ﬁbrils are disorganized in the mutants lacking cellulose - binding activity and this results in spores with compromised viability . Only members of the PsB complex are drawn . Other proteins , such as SP75 and SpiA , which are known to reside in the coat are not shown in this model . the major spore coat proteins ( SP96 , PsB , SP70 and SP60 ) are preassembled into the PsB multiprotein complex which is stored within the PSVs ( Devine et al . , 1983 ; Watson et al . , 1994 ) . The PsB complex has endogenous cellulose - binding activity and the results suggested that the assembly of the PsB complex subunits is a prerequisite for the cellulose - binding activity . Indeed , none of the individual proteins have the classical cellulose - binding motifs seen in the cellulase enzymes . Mutants lacking either the SP96 or SP70 proteins of the complex , due to the deletion of the cognate genes , form incomplete complexes which do not retain cellulose - binding activity , while mutants lacking SP60 retain this activity ( McGuire & Alexander , 1996 ) . Since the PsB complex localizes to the cellulose - rich spore coat , these data led to the hypothesis that the cellulose - binding activity of the PsB complex plays an active role in the normal development of the spore coat . The data in this paper clearly demonstrate that there is a direct cor - relation between the cellulose - binding activity of the PsB complex , the structural integrity of the spore coat and the viability of the spores . Using immunoﬂuorescence microscopy and biochemical extractions , we ﬁrst showed that partial PsB complexes and free SP96 do localize to the coat even when they do not have cellulose - binding activity . However , in the cases of the cotA − , cotB − and cotABC − strains , the coats are improperly assembled . The aberrant antibody stain - ing of the mutant spores is due to an increased porosity of the spore coat or incorrect orientation of the PsB complex within the coat , or more likely a combination of the two factors . In contrast , deletion of the SP60 protein alone in the cotC − strain does not alter the structure of the coat ( Fig . 4 ) . Thus , it is the loss of the cellulose - binding activity of the PsB complex , rather than the mere loss of individual spore coat proteins , that results in compromised spore coat structure . 1837 Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Fri , 11 Jan 2019 16 : 02 : 26 S . SRINIVASAN and OTHERS Examination of spore viability conﬁrmed the correlation between cellulose - binding activity and normal spore coat assembly and provided a quantitative measure of the eﬀect . Although loss of SP60 results in no apparent diﬀerence in spore coat structure , a small but measurable reduction in viability was observed ( 3 – 10 - fold ) . This indicates that SP60 is an important structural component of the spore coat whose presence is essential for normal cell survival , even though it is not required for the cellulose - binding activity of the PsB complex . Our results are in disagreement with ﬁndings reported by Fosnaugh et al . ( 1994 ) who claimed that there was no compromised viability of spores from any of the spore coat protein mutants , although they did show an increased permeability to the lectin ricin A . It has recently been shown that the C - terminal half of recombinant PsB protein binds cellulose in vitro ( Zhang et al . , 1998 , 1999 ) . The present study strongly supports our earlier work showing that PsB complexes that lack SP96 or SP70 , but that do have the PsB protein , do not bind cellulose ( McGuire & Alexander , 1996 ) . Thus , we suggest that the proper positioning of PsB within the fully assembled multiprotein complex allows the correct exposure of the PsB protein cellulose - binding site to cellulose in situ . In mutant strains lacking either the SP96 or SP70 proteins , the cellulose - binding site of PsB would not be available . Presumably , this idea can be tested when all the PsB complex proteins are expressed in vitro , although it must be remembered that each of these proteins is heavily glycosylated with speciﬁc oligosaccharides ( Champion et al . , 1995 ) . Overall , this and earlier studies present a picture where assembly of the PsB complex proteins results in a multiprotein complex with a speciﬁc cellulose - binding activity . Neither the complete assembly of the complex , nor the resulting binding activity is required for secretion and localization into the spore coat . However , the cellulose - binding activity is required for proper assembly and organization of the spore coat , and for the subsequent viability of the spores . Under natural con - ditions this reduction in viability would dramatically aﬀect their survival . We suggest that the primary function for the cellulose - binding activity of the PsB complex is to organize the cellulose ﬁbrils so that the spore coat is impermeable and resistant to environ - mental stress ( Fig . 4 ) . Other proteins , such as SP60 and SpiA ( Richardson & Loomis , 1992 ) , which do not aﬀect cellulose binding , also play important structural roles in the formation and maintenance of the spore coat ECM . Nothing is known about how cellulose synthesis is co - ordinated with its deposition in the spore coat at terminal morphogenesis . The cellulose synthase gene in D . discoideum has recently been cloned and is expected to reveal information about cellulose deposition and assembly , although its localization within the cell is not yet known ( Blanton et al . , 2000 ) . It remains to be shown how the timing of cellulose synthesis in the prespore cells is co - ordinated with the secretion of the contents of the PSVs . Earlier work from West & Erdos ( 1990 ) suggests that spore coat protein secretion occurs before cellulose deposition and this agrees well with the conclusions of this study , which shows that the cellulose - binding activity of the PsB complex is required for the normal assembly of the spore coat . The structure of the D . discoideum spore coat is reminiscent of plant cell walls , in that both are complex matrices composed of glycoproteins , polysaccharides and cellulose . The genesis of plant cell walls is intimately linked to the growth and development of plant cells and tissues ( Delmer , 1999 ) . Glycoproteins from cell walls of angiosperms can also be extracted under diﬀerent conditions . Loosely associated proteins can be washed oﬀ with buﬀer , proteins bound by ionic interactions can be removed by salt washes and covalently bound proteins are extracted under strong reducing conditions ( McNeil et al . , 1984 ) . During cell wall formation , cellulose is synthesized and extruded across the plasma membrane . The cellulose microﬁbrils are thought to self - assemble in the extracellular space , although the direction of cellulose deposition may be guided by microtubules lying adjacent to the membrane ( Cosgrove , 1997 ) . Yet , the detailed mechanisms by which plant cell wall structures are assembled are largely unknown and it is possible that there are cellulose - binding proteins that play a role in guiding this process , similar to that occurring in D . discoideum spore coats . Recently , the PSVs , which contain most of the com - ponents of the future spore coat have been puriﬁed from diﬀerent stages of development ( Srinivasan et al . , 1999 ) . This has allowed us to begin an exhaustive charac - terization of the PSV contents by proteomics ( Yan et al . , 1997 ) . An analysis of the protein content of the PSVs will reveal the presence of additional structural proteins of the spore coat , as well as enzymes which may be required for coat assembly and formation , such as protein disulﬁde isomerases . Such analyses are expected to increase our understanding of how the D . discoideum spore coat is assembled with its precise polarity and organization at terminal diﬀerentiation .
