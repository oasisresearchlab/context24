Natural Killer ( NK ) cells , a major component of the innate immune sys - tem are mediators of anti - tumor immunity and the most actively migrating cells among leukocytes . Actin rearrangement , promoted by cofilin plays a central role in cellular migration . Leptin affects the phosphoryla - tion - dependent activity of cofilin and thus actin remodeling . We used human NK - 92 cells to explore the in vitro effects of leptin on co - localization of cofilin and F - actin and on morphological changes in NK cells . NK - 92 cells were incubated with different leptin concentrations ( 10 and 100 ng / mL ) for 30 min and 24 h and immunocytochemically stained . Results demonstrate a dose - and time - dependent influence of leptin on cellu - lar morphology . Utilizing confocal microscopy , we observed that the co - local - ization of cofilin - 1 and F - actin was slightly influenced by leptin . In summary , the pres - ent study demonstrates an impact of a phys - iological leptin stimulation on the filopodia length , and a time - dependent effect on the co - localization of cofilin and F - actin in NK - 92 cells . Introduction Obesity is a medical condition charac - terized by excessive body fat with a body mass index ( BMI ) exceeding 30 kg / m 2 and is one of the most serious and escalating public health problems affecting all age and socioeconomic groups in developed as well as developing countries . In 2014 , the World Health Organization reported that over 1 . 9 billion adults ( 39 % ) were overweight and more than 600 million adults ( 13 % ) were obese . 1 Both conditions are associated with an increased production of metabolic hor - mones coupled with a chronic low - grade state of inflammation that is linked to vari - ous disease entities , such as type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease . 2 Furthermore , several analyses have shown an association between high BMI and an increased inci - dence of certain types of cancer , like kid - ney , liver and colorectal cancer . 3 - 4 Adipose tissue not only plays an important role as an energy storage site , but also modulates immune cells through the release of adipokines , such as leptin , resistin , adiponectin , as well as cytokines such as interleukin ( IL ) - 6 and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - α . 5 Leptin is the most widely studied adipocyte - derived hormone whose produc - tion and circulating levels depend on the amount of adipose tissue . 6 Leptin , the prod - uct of obese ( ob ) gene , is a 16 - kDa non - gly - cosylated protein , mainly secreted by adipocytes . 7 , 8 Structurally , leptin is a mem - ber of the helical cytokine family , including IL - 6 , IL - 11 , IL - 12 , and granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor . 9 , 10 Furthermore , leptin also affects actin micro - filaments interfering with cofilin - severing function . 11 In the last years it became evi - dent that leptin also modulates both the adaptive and the innate immune system . 12 , 13 Natural Killer ( NK ) cells , with their capa - bility of lysing certain infected or tumor cells are a major component of the innate immune system . On the one hand , NK cells mediate their anti - tumor response by direct cellular induction of target cell lysis via exocytosis of granzymes and perforin . On the other hand , NK cells activate the adap - tive immune system by secreting different cytokines , like interferon - ( IFN - ) γ and TNF - α , in order to minimize tumor progres - sion and metastases . 14 NK - 92 is a well - established human cell line for investigating NK cell physiology since they exhibit func - tional and phenotypical characteristics of primary NK cells . 15 Cell movement or motility is a highly dynamic phenomenon that is essential for a variety of biological processes such as cancer metastasis and immune responses . 16 The most active migrating cells among leukocytes are NK cells . 17 Cell movement begins with restruc - turing of the actin cytoskeleton and can mostly be divided into three stages . 18 First , the cell orients and reorganizes the actin network at its leading edge . Secondly , it adheres to the substrate at the leading edge and de - adheres at the cell body and rear of the cell . Finally , contractile forces pull the cell forward . 19 Protrusive structures at the leading edge of motile cells are highly dynamic and contain dense arrays of actin filaments . The simplest protrusive struc - tures are filopodia , thin cylinders that can extend tens of microns from the main cor - tex . 20 Filopodia contain a tight bundle of long actin filaments oriented in the direc - tion of protrusion 21 and they are used for the exploration of the extracellular matrix . Protrusion and building of filopodia are based on actin filament turnover . The turnover is the continuous polymerization and de - polymerization of actin filaments . Cofilin - 1 ( 19kDa , non - muscle cofilin ) is a small ubiquitous actin binding protein , which binds to F - actin and plays an essen - tial role in enhancing actin - filament dynam - ics and accelerating the depolymerization of actin filaments . 22 The activities of cofilin are reversibly regulated by phosphorylation and de - phosphorylation at Ser3 , with the phosphorylated form being inactive . 23 One of the major signaling pathways regulating the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is the small G protein Ras homolog gene fam - ily ( Rho ) / Rho - associated coiled - coil - form - ing protein kinase ( ROCK ) pathway . 24 Activated Rho / ROCK relays intracellular Correspondence : Prof .

Materials and Methods Cell culture The well - established human NK cell line NK - 92 was cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium ( Biochrom AG , Berlin , Germany ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Biochrom AG ) , 1 % penicillin , 1 % streptomycin , 1 % sodium - pyruvate , 1 % L - glutamine ( Biochrom AG ) , and 200 U / mL human recombinant interleukin - ( IL - ) 2 ( Novartis AG , Basel , Switzerland ) . Stimulation with leptin and immunofluorescence staining In three independent experiments , human NK - 92 cells ( 5x10 5 ) were incubated in 1 mL RPMI - Medium 1640 with 20 % FBS and 200 U / mL IL - 2 on 13 mm cover slips coated with 20 μg / mL human Fibronectin ( Culturex ® Human Fibronectin , PathClear ® , Amsbio , Abington , UK ) and stimulated with 10 ng / mL ( physiological concentration ) and 100 ng / mL ( pathophysi - ological concentration ) recombinant human leptin ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN , USA ) for 30 min and 24 h . Thereafter , cells were fixed and permeabilized with 4 % PSA ( Formalin solution , 10 % , Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) , incubated with the primary monoclonal anti - Cofilin - 1 antibody ( 1 : 50 ; D3F9 , Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA , USA ) for 1 h at room tem - perature and stained with Phalloidin - TRITC ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louise , MO , USA ) for 1 h at room temper - ature , donkey anti - rabbit Alexa 488 ( 1 : 310 ; Dianova GmbH , Hamburg , Germany ) for 1 h at room temperature and DAPI ( 1 : 50 , 000 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) for 5 min at room tempera - ture . Slides were mounted with ProLong ® Gold ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Confocal laser scanning microscopy and data acquisition Images were acquired with a Leica - TCS SP5 X confocal microscope equipped with a white light laser and hybrid detectors using a 63x oil immersion objective ( NA 1 . 40 ) and standardized settings . From each cover slip 5 - 6 images were collected . The images were detected and analyzed with Fiji / ImageJ 2 . 0 . 0 - rc - 59 / 1 . 51j . Cell morphology In order to investigate the influence of leptin , filopodia length and NK cell circum - ference were measured in 44 - 45 cells per group ( control 30 min , control 24 h , 10 ng / mL leptin 24 h , 100 ng / mL leptin 30 min and 100 ng / mL leptin 24 h ) . Due to a mount - ing problem in the group stimulated with 10 ng / mL leptin for 30 min only 35 cells could be analyzed in this group . The filopodia length was measured beginning from the proper end of the cell membrane . Per group 600 - 1200 filopodia lengths were measured . To ensure statistical correctness , all meas - ured lengths of filopodia in each group were randomized by software for n = 600 . Co - localization analysis For the examination of the co - localiza - tion of cofilin and F - actin the Mander’s co - localization coefficients were evaluated in regions of interest ( ROI ) with Coloc 2 in ImageJ . Coloc 2 is a Fiji / ImageJ plugin for co - localization analysis . For each experi - mental group , 28 - 30 cells were measured and Costes regression was performed . The ROIs were determined with ROI plugin . The nucleus area was subtracted . To avoid a manipulation of the co - localization coeffi - cients no background subtractions were per - formed . For the analysis with Coloc2 an auto - threshold was set . Co - occurrence can be quantified by expressing the number of co - occurring pixels as a fraction of the total number or by using the Mander’s co - local - ization coefficients ( MCC ) M1 ( fractional co - localization coefficient for F - actin to cofilin ) and M2 ( fractional co - localization coefficient for cofilin to F - actin ) which , separately for each fluorophore , record the fraction of the total fluorescence that co - occurs . These coefficients are proportional to the amount of fluorescence of the co - localizing proteins like F - actin and cofilin , relatively to the total fluorescence in that region of interest . The measuring points range from 0 to 1 , whereas 0 means no and 1 means 100 % overlap . 27 Statistical analysis Data analysis was performed with the one - way ANOVA with the Tukey multiple comparison test for post - hoc analysis using Prism 7 . 0 ( GraphPad . Software , Inc . , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . P < 0 . 05 was considered as statistical significant and marked with a star . Data from three independent experi - ments are depicted as means + SEM .

Results Short - term leptin treatment alters length and number of filopodia but not cell circumferences The incubation with 10 ng / mL leptin for 30 min resulted in a significantly shorter length of filopodia compared to control cells ( Figure 1A ) , while the incubation for 24 h revealed similar results in all groups ( Figure 1B ) . The treatment with 100 ng / mL leptin had no effect on the length of filopo - dia . The highest maximal length of filopo - dia was found in the group of cells stimulat - ed with 10 ng / mL leptin for 24 h ( 15 % high - er compared to cells stimulated with 10 ng / mL for 30 min ) ( Table 1 ) . Furthermore , numbers of filopodia per cell after stimula - tion with 10 ng / mL leptin for 24 h were slightly enhanced compared to the numbers after the treatment with 10 ng / mL for 30 min ( Figure 2 A , B ) . In the present study , no effect of a leptin stimulation on the NK cell circumference could be shown ( Figure 3 A , B ) . Influence of leptin on the co - local - ization of F - actin and cofilin in NK - 92 cells Table 2 shows the fractional co - localiza - tion coefficients for F - actin ( red fluores - cence ; tM1 ) and cofilin ( green fluorescence ; tM2 ) with auto - threshold used by Coloc 2 . The overlap of F - actin to cofilin ( represented by tM1 ) after short - term ( 30 min ) leptin stimulation ranged from 53 % to 58 % between all groups . The overlap decreased by approximately 10 % after long - term ( 24 h ) stimulation and ranges from 45 % to 49 % between all groups .

Interestingly , the incubation with 10 ng / mL leptin for 24 h showed a lower overlap of cofilin to F - actin as compared to the corresponding control . Concerning the intracellular localizations , Figures 4 and 5 show a ubiquitous occur - rence of cofilin in the cells and a co - localiza - tion with F - actin at the membrane . The sig - nificantly shorter filopodia length after short - term stimulation ( 10 ng / mL for 30 min ) can be seen in Figure 4 . Discussion Leptin , can be considered as a link between the immune system and cancer . 28 , 29 Several studies have shown a positive cor - relation between high leptin levels , an increased cancer incidence and altered immune cell functions . 29 - 31 Obesity is asso - ciated with significantly increased leptin levels in the blood . 32 NK cells are a sub - group of lymphocytes playing an essential role in cell - based immune defense against virus infected and transformed cells . 33 To date , only sparse information on the influ - ence of leptin regarding the migratory per - formance , actin turnover rate and phospho - rylation of cofilin is available . Mattioli et al . could show that physiological leptin con - centrations time - dependently enhanced the amount of F - actin in immature human den - dritic cells . 11 In addition , O’Malley et al . could demonstrate an effect of leptin on filopodia outgrowth in neurons via the acti - vation of MAPK ( ERK ) signaling path - way . 34 For the first time , the present study investigated the influence of leptin on filopodia and the extent of morphological changes in NK cells . To explore the dose - and time - dependent impact of leptin on parameters of NK cell motility , an in vitro experiment with NK - 92 cells was per - formed and the length and numbers of filopodia per cell and the circumference of the cells were investigated . Filopodia are known as the simplest protrusion tool dur - ing cell movement , containing high amounts of actin filaments . 20 Several former studies demonstrated that filopodia influ - ence cell migration . 35 , 36 Here we report on a dose - and time - dependent influence of lep - tin on the filopodia length . The lengths of filopodia were significantly decreased in cells after physiological leptin stimulation with 10 ng / mL for 30 min compared to cells of all other groups . This result may indicate an altered migratory behavior of these NK - 92 cells . Xue et al . showed filopodia alter - ations during cell migration cycle in B16F1 mouse melanoma cells . 37 It could be shown that during the protrusion phase filopodia Original Paper Figure 2 .

[ page 16 ] [ European Journal of Histochemistry 2018 ; 62 : 2848 ] were initiated , elongated and remained within the lamellopodium . During the retraction phase the projected filopodia were persistently growing , while the lamel - lipodium edge was retracted towards the filopodia base . Furthermore , the number of stationary filopodia increased and re - decreased while the cell was moving . 37 In contrary to the stimulation with physiologi - cal leptin concentrations the treatment with higher leptin levels did not affect the filopo - dia length . Furthermore , the amount of filopodia per cell was almost constant in all investigated groups , with a slight increase in cells after a long - term stimulation with physiological leptin dosages . It has to be taken into consideration that in the present study solely two time points could be inves - tigated . In view of the relatively short sequences of cell migration cycles and con - comitant alterations in filopodia length within the time - frame of a few minutes , future studies should investigate time - dependent dynamics of NK cell migration patterns induced by a leptin stimulation via live cell imaging . The influence of leptin on filopodia and consequently on the move - ment of NK cells is important . NK cells play an important role in cellular immune defense . An impairment of NK cells move - ment results in a restricted immune defense against tumor cells . This study shows for the first time , that physiological concentra - tions of the adipokine leptin could increase the motility of NK cells and thus possibly support immune defense in different tissues . The stimulation with pathophysiologically high levels of leptin showed no influence on the filopodia length , number of filopodia per cell and the cell circumferences . However , several former studies have demonstrated that high concentrations of leptin impair NK cell cytotoxicity . 38 - 40 Possibly , pathophysiologically high con - centrations of leptin affect NK cells less on a morphological and more on a cytotoxic level . In a rodent lung metastasis model Spielmann et al . could demonstrate signifi - cantly increased lung metastasis in diet - induced obese rats accompanied with decreased numbers of NK cells in the lung tissue , reduced NK cell - tumor cell contacts and reduced expression of the activating NK cell receptor NKG2D . 41 The comparison of the circumference of the NK cells indicated no influence of lep - tin . Somersalo et al . showed morphological alterations of human NK cells during migration on fibronectin - coated filters . NK cells migrating through untreated filters exerted mostly round shapes compared to prominent spread cells which migrated on fibronectin - coated filters . 42 The results of the present study refer to the circumference and not to the morphological shape . Thus , it is conceivable that the cell shape is altered without a quantifiable effect on the cell cir - cumference . Morphological parameters of cells are one aspect of the complex process of cell motility . Intracellular signaling path - ways need to be analyzed and linked with morphological changes in NK cells . To explore the impact of leptin on the co - local - ization of cofilin and F - actin in NK - 92 cells , regions of interest ( ROI ) were defined and the overlap of the fluorescence for both proteins was quantified by using Mander’s co - localization coefficient . The results indi - cated a time - dependent effect of the co - localization of cofilin to F - actin . The over - lap of cofilin to F - actin was influenced by the treatment with 10 ng / mL leptin . The rel - evance of cofilin as an essential protein for the actin dynamics during cell motility has been well investigated . 43 , 44 The proximity of cofilin to F - actin is required for a cell move - ment . Furthermore , a higher overlap could suggest an increased interaction between cofilin and F - actin , and consecutively an increased migratory behavior . We assume that the short - term treatment with leptin in a physiological concentration stimulates the overlap of cofilin and F - actin in NK - 92 cells and facilitates cell migration . This result further supports the positive effect of leptin on NK cell morphology in a healthy microenvironment and the lack of this stim - ulatory impulse in a pathophysiological ( obese ) microenvironment . One possible underlying molecular mechanism for the impact of leptin on the co - localization of cofilin and F - actin could be an activation of Original Paper Figure 5 .

[ European Journal of Histochemistry 2018 ; 62 : 2848 ] [ page 17 ] [ page 18 ] [ European Journal of Histochemistry 2018 ; 62 : 2848 ] the RhoA / ROCK / LIMK / cofilin - 2 cascade as shown by Li et al . in nucleus pulposus cells . 26 Nevertheless , a close co - localization does not prove a biochemical interaction . Further studies with NK cells are required to investigate the contribution of leptin to the interaction of cofilin and actin and intra - cellular pathways during NK cell migratory processes . Furthermore , Ngo et al . showed with high - speed atomic force microscopy technology that cofilin - bound actin fila - ments were merely 2 nm thicker compared to the corresponding actin filaments without bounded cofilin . 45 The assessment of co - localization in the present study is suscepti - ble to the resolution limits of a confocal microscope . Furthermore , analyzes of 2D images of 3D cells depend on intersecting planes . Overlapping structures from other levels cannot be ruled out . In summary , the present study demonstrates an impact of physiological leptin stimulation on the filopodia length and a time - dependent effect on the co - localization of cofilin and F - actin in NK - 92 cells .
