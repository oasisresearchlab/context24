Dissociation of Clathrin Coats Coupled to the Hydrolysis of ATP : Role of an Uncoating ATPase ABSTRACT (cid:9) ATP hydrolysis was used to power the enzymatic release of clathrin from coated vesicles . The 70 , 000 - mol - wt protein , purified on the basis of its ATP - dependent ability to disassemble clathrin cages , was found to possess a clathrin - dependent ATPase activity . Hydrolysis was specific for ATP ; neither dATP nor other ribonucleotide triphosphates would either substitute for ATP or inhibit the hydrolysis of ATP in the presence of clathrin cages . The ATPase activity is elicited by clathrin in the form of assembled cages , but not by clathrin trimers , the product of cage disassembly . The 70 , 000 - mol - wt polypeptide , but not clathrin , was labeled by ATP in photochemical cross - linking , indicating that the hydrolytic site for ATP resides on the uncoating protein . Conditions of low pH or high magnesium concentration uncouple ATP hydrolysis from clathrin release , as ATP is hydrolyzed although essentially no clathrin is released . This suggests that the recognition event triggering clathrin - dependent ATP hydrolysis occurs in the absence of clathrin release , and presumably precedes such release . An important step in interorganelle transport is the removal ofthe clathrin coat from freshly budded coated vesicles . This facilitates the eventual fusion of the contained vesicle with its target membrane and also liberates the clathrin for use in further rounds of coated vesicle budding ( 1 , 5 , 15 , 17 , 24 ) . The accompanying paper ( 18 ) described the purification of a protein capable of removing clathrin from coated vesicles . The uncoating protein will also dissociate artificial cages made only of clathrin and its light chains . Disassembly requires micromolar levels of ATP ; moreover , nonhydrolyzable ana - logues of ATP show little ability to support this enzymatic uncoating ( 14 , 18 ) . These results suggest that nucleotide hy - drolysis is needed to power disassembly of clathrin . Any enzyme that efficiently couples ATP hydrolysis to another process will hydrolyze ATP only when all of the substrates needed for the reaction are present . Therefore , we have investigated whether the uncoating protein possesses an ATPase activity that is manifest only in the presence of its other substrate , clathrin cages .

ROTHMAN Department of Biochemistry , Stanford University Medical School , Stanford , California 94305 Materials : (cid:9) The materials used and manufacturers they were obtained from were as follows : [ 2 ; H ] ATP ( 20 Ci / mmol ) from Amersham Corp . , ( Ar - lington Heights , IL ) ; [ a - ' zP ] ATP ( 400 Ci / mmol ) , [ y - " P ] ATP ( 3 , 000 Ci / mmol ) from New England Nuclear ( Boston , MA ) ; ATP , GTP , CTP , UTP , ADP , and dATP from P - L Biochemical Inc . ( Milwaukee , WI ) ; ATP analogues ( AMP - 734 PNP , AMP - PCP , ATP [ y ] S ) ' from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals ( Indi - anapolis , IN ) ; Elastase from Worthington Enzymes ( Freehold , NJ ) ; Polygram CEL300 PEI and thin layer chromatography plates from Machery - Nagel and Co . ( Duren , Federal Republic ofGermany ) . Preparation of Washed Cages for ATPase Assays : (cid:9) Cages were washed with Triton X - 100 to remove a contaminating ATPase activity . These washed cages retained theirability to be dissociated by uncoating protein in the presence of ATP . To do this , clathrin , purified as described in the previous paper ( 18 ) , was dialyzed at a protein concentration of l mg / ml into buffer A ( 20 mM 2 - ( N - morpholino ) ethane sulfonic acid buffer , pH 6 . 2 , 2 MM CaC12 , l mM EDTA ) for 14 - 16 hrat 4°C to generate empty clathrin cages ( 6 , 20 ) . These cages were then incubated at 0 . 5 mg / ml protein in buffer A containing 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 for 30 min at 4°C , and thestable cagesremaining werecentrifuged for 90 min at 25 , 000 rpm in an SW50 . 1 rotor ( Beckman Instruments , Inc . , Palo Alto , CA ) at 4°C . This pellet ofwashed clathrin cages was resuspended in buffer B ( 75 mM KCI , 40 mM HEPES buffer , pH 7 . 0 , 4 . 5 mM Mg - acetate , 0 . 8 mM dithiothreitol ) at I mg / ml protein , and then incubated 10 min at 37°C to dissociate poorly assembled aggregates , and then centrifuged for 10 min in a Beckman A 30 / 100 airfuge rotor ( Beckman Instruments , Inc . ) at 95 , 000 g . , . This pellet was resuspended in buffer A at the desired concentration and used as substrate in ATPase assays . Clathrin - dependent ATPase Assay : (cid:9) The method employed was a modification ofthe methodofKornberget al . ( 8 ) . A typical complete incubation ( 20 ul ) contained , in buffer C ( 25 mM KCI , 20 mM HEPES buffer , pH 7 . 0 , 10 mM [ NH4 ] ZSO4 , 2 mM Mg - acetate , 0 . 8 mM dithiothreitol ) : 0 . 2 mg / ml of Trison X - 100 - washed clathrin cages , 0 . 5 uCi of [ 2 - ' H ] ATP , 20 uM unlabeled ' Abbreviations used in this paper : AMP - PNP , 5 ' - adenylylimidodi - phosphate ; AMP - PCP , 5 ' - adenylyl - ( ß , y - methylene ) - diphosphonate ; ATP ( y ) S , adenosine - 5 ' - O - ( 3 - thiotriphosphate ) . THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY " VOLUME 99 AUGUST 1984 734 - 741 0 The Rockefeller University Press - 0021 - 9525 / 84 / 08 / 0734 / 08 $ 1 . 00 ATP , and the uncoating protein fraction to be tested ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 8 pg of purified protein ) . Controls consisted of omitting cages or omitting uncoating protein from the incubations . The time course ofhydrolysis at 37°C was followed by applying I pl samplesto polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layerchromatography plates that had been pre - spotted with 0 . 5 pl of a mixture ofcarrier nucleotides ( 10 mM each ofATP , ADP and AMP ) . Plates were developed in 0 . 7 M LiCl / 1 M HCOOH buffer , and dried . The ATP , ADP , and AMP spots were located with UV light , excised , and counted in Aquasol 11 scintillation fluid ( New England Nuclear ) . The radioactivity in each spot were expressed as a fraction of the total recovered in each lane . The fractions of ' H present as AMP and ADP contaminants in the unincubated [ ' HIATP substrate were determined , and subtracted as background . The specific ( clathrin - dependent ) hydrolysiswas defined as hydrolysis in mixtures of cages and uncoating protein greater than the sum ofhydrolysis with the two alone . The cage aloneand uncoatingprotein alone values were determined from parallel control incubations in which one or the other componentwas omitted . This specifichydrolysisgenerallyexceeded the sum ofthe rates in the two controls by a factor of about 8 - 10 . The fraction of ATP hydrolyzed in a clathrin - dependent fashion was thus calculated , and converted to picomoles . Fig . 1 shows this raw data presenting the complete and both control incubations . For other figures , only the specific hydrolysis ( the complete minus the sum ofthe two controls ) is presented . Affinity Labeling with ATP : (cid:9) The procedure used was a modification of the method of Yue and Schimmel ( 28 ) . A typical incubation contained between I and 10 pg protein in 25 m l ofbuffer C , 10 pCi of [ a - ' 2 P ] ATP , and 1 pM unlabeled ATP . UV irradiation was performed at 4°C for 20 min with a 1 mW / CM Z exposure rate from a General Electric G15T8 15 - W germicidal lamp . Samples were then precipitated for SDS - PAGE analysis with 10 % tríchloroace - tic acid , with 20 pg ofcytochrome c added as carrier . The pellets were dissolved in sample buffer , neutralized with Tris base , and analyzed by SDS PAGE according to Laemmli ( 9 ) using a 10 % polyacrylamide gel . Gels were stained for protein with Coomassie R - 250 dye , dried , and autoradiographed using Kodak XAR - 5 film and Du Pont Cronex intensifyingscreens . Exposures of - 1 d were typically required . RESULTS Clathrin - dependent Hydrolysis of ATP by Uncoating ATPase To examine whether ATP is hydrolyzed under conditions in which ATP - dependent disassembly of cages occurs , we added [ 2 - ' H ] ATP to standard incubations containing clathrin cages and the purified uncoating protein ( Fig . 1 ) . Samples were analyzed by polyethyleneimine - cellulose thin layer chro - matography as described by Komberg et al . ( 8 ) , separating ATP , ADP , and AMP . Control incubations containing un - coating protein but not clathrin cages , or vice - versa , showed very little ATP hydrolysis . But , complete incubations contain - ing both uncoating protein and clathrin cages did hydrolyze ATP ( Fig . 1 , closed circles ) . Thus , ATP is hydrolyzed only when both cages and uncoating protein are present , i . e . , when disassembly is taking place . The products ofthis ATP hydrol - ysis appear to be exclusively ADP and free Pi , since all of the ' H released from ATP co - migrated with ADP on thin layer plates . Likewise , all of the ' ZP released from ATP when [ , y - " P ] ATP was employed as substrate chromatographed with Pi ( not shown ) . As coated vesicles contain a membrane - associ - ated ATPase ( 27 ) that obscures the activity of uncoating ATPase , ATP hydrolysis data were not obtainable with coated vesicles as substrate . The specific or " clathrin - dependent " ATP hydrolysis was calculated by subtracting from the total ATP hydrolyzed the small amounts due to cages and uncoating protein alone . This quantity , pertinent to the uncoating process , was linear with time at early times of incubation , and with added uncoating enzyme up to 10 kg / ml ( Fig . 2 ) . The complex kinetics at later times and higher protein concentrations probably reflect changes in the clathrin substrate resulting from disassembly . The data in the previous paper ( 18 ) indicate that 80 - 90 % of the clathrin has been released from cage substrate at the times and enzyme levels at which these curves become nonlinear . The initial rate ofcage - dependent ATP hydrolysis followed simple Michaelis - Menton kinetics with respect to ATP and empty cage concentrations ( Fig . 3 ) . The Km values for ATP É N 0 a so TIME ( min ) FIGURE 1 (cid:9) Clathrin cage - dependent ATPase assay . Uncoating pro - tein ( 0 . 8 pg ) was incubated at 37°C in 20 pl volume of buffer D ( buffer C , except 20 mM MES buffer at 6 . 75 was substituted for HEPES ) containing also 20 pM ATP , 0 . 5 tiCi of [ 2 ' H ] ATP , and 0 . 2 mg / ml of Triton X - 100 - washed clathrin cages . Samples ( 1 WI ) were removed and analyzed by thin layer chromatography as described in Materials and Methods . For this graph , the raw data for ATP hydrolysis are shown for the complete incubation ( 9 ) and also for the two control incubations in which either cages ( A ) or uncoating ATPase ( p ) were omitted . In later figures , the curves shown are obtained by subracting the sum of the two controls ( i . e . , the expected hydrolysis if the components were additive ) from the results for the complete incubation . Plotted is the total amount of ATP ( picomoles ) hydrolyzed in the 20 - pl incubation vs . time . to FIGURE 2 (cid:9) Clathrin - dependent ATPase as a function of time and of uncoating protein concentration .

The clathrin - dependent AT - Pase was calculated from raw data as described in Materials and Methods , and is shown here . ( Lower panel ) Concentration depend - ence . Conditions as above , but for 10 min at 37°C with variable amounts of uncoating protein added to each 20 - pl incubation . BRAELL ET AL . Clathrin - dependent ATPase (cid:9) 735 and clathrin cages were 0 . 7 pM and 0 . 12 mg / ml ( - 0 . 8 MM Clathrin , corresponding to 7 TIM of cages ) , respectively . These values were in very good agreement with the Km values for these substrates derived from the ATP - dependent release of Clathrin ( 18 ) . Under conditions in which Clathrin and ATP are saturating , the turnover number ofthe ATPase , calculated from Fig . 3 , is about 1 ATP per 70 , 000 - mol - wt polypeptide chain per min at pH 7 . 0 , 2 mM Mg " , 37°C . The rate ofATP hydrolysis was unaffected when uncoating protein was treated with 5 mM n - ethylmaleimide at 25°C for 60 min . Thus , ATPase and uncoating activity ( 18 ) are both n - ethylmaleimide - resistant . Co - purification of Uncoating and Clathrin - dependent ATPase Activities The activities ofprotein fractions were monitored for ATP - dependent release of Clathrin from cages and for Clathrin cage - .

At each step essentially the same degree of purification ofthe two different activities was obtained . Their co - purification makes it likely that both activities reside in the 70 , 000 - mol - wt polypeptide brought to near homogeneity by this purification . Specificity of the ATPase for ATP How selective is the Clathrin - dependent ATPase for ATP ? The abilities of various nucleotides and their analogues to inhibit the Clathrin - dependent hydrolysis of ATP is shown in Table I , and compared with the ability of these same com - pounds to inhibit the ATP - dependent release ofClathrin from cages . The two different assays were performed under identical buffer and substrate conditions , using time and enzyme levels in the linear range of the assays . Only ADP was found to be effective in inhibiting either assay when added in 40 - fold excess of ATP ( Table II ) . The other ribonucleoside triphos - phates , and dATP had little or no inhibitory effect . Since CTP , UTP , ATP and dATP did not inhibit ATP hydrolysis , it can also be concluded that they themselves are not hydrolyzed by the uncoating ATPase in a Clathrin - de - 1 / V 4 3 2 KM - 0 . 7 PM - 1 0 1 2 3 1 / [ ATPI I1V KM - 0 . 12 mplml 3 11 - - - , - 10 0 10 20 30 40 V [ CAGEI Inhibitor * Uncoatingac - tivity ( percent of control ) Cage - depend - ent ATPase ac - tivity ( percent of control ) None ( control ) * [ 100 ] [ 100 ] 300 uM GTP 70 65 300uM CTP 95 87 300 uM UTP 90 100 300 uM cIATP 100 91 300 uM ADP 7 7 300 uM AMP - PCP 100 89 300AM AMP - PNP 68 58 300 uM ATP ( y ) S 50 27 Purification step uncoating activity ulrng ATPase activity pmol / min / mg Uncoating ATPase Cytosol 352 47 [ 1 ] [ 1 ] DE - 52 1 , 050 152 3 . 0 3 . 2 Hydroxylapatite 2 , 140 323 2 . 0 2 . 1 ATP - Sepharose 13 , 400 2 , 267 6 . 3 6 . 7 pendent manner . This was confirmed directly in the cases of CTP , UTP , GTP , and dATP using radioactive nucleotide as substrate in place of [ ' H ] ATP ( data not shown ) . The nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogues had comparable effects upon the two assays : for both clathrin - dependent ATP hydrolysis and clathrin release , AMP - PCP had little effect , AMP - PNP was moderately inhibitory , and ATP - ( y ) S inhib - ited strongly at 40 - fold excess levels over ATP . Uncoating Protein But Not Clathrin Contains a High Affinity Binding Site Specific for ATP The above results demonstrate that ATP is hydrolyzed only when cages and uncoating protein are present . The active site of ATP hydrolysis interacts with ATP with high ( 0 . 7 AM ) affinity . Which molecule , clathrin or uncoating protein , is the ATPase ? Conceivably , uncoating protein could cause clathrin to bind and hydrolyze ATP , or vice versa . To distinguish these possibilities , incubations containing [ a " P ] ATP were subjected to a photo - cross - linking procedure capable of form - ing covalent bonds between ATP and proteins ( 4 , 12 , 28 ) . The method employed , first described by Yue and Schimmel ( 28 ) , has two advantages . It is specific for nucleotides bound tightly to a protein , and it does not require the use of a nucleotide analogue to effect cross - linking . A complete incubation ( Fig . 4 , lane J ) or those containing only uncoating protein ( lane C ) or clathrin cages ( lane A ) were irradiated with UV light in the presence of 1 AM [ a - " P ] ATP and analyzed by SDS PAGE . No labeling of clathrin or its light chains was observed ( Fig . 4 , lanes A and J ) , but the uncoating protein of 70 , 000 mol wt was strongly labeled whether or not clathrin was present . The UV - induced labeling of uncoating protein was prevented by the inclusion of 30 or 100 , M unlabeled ATP , or by 100 , M unlabeled ADP , during irradiation ( Fig . 4 , lanes D , E , and F ) . However , additions of a 100 - fold excess of GTP , CTP , UPT , or dATP had little effect on labeling by [ ' ' P ] ATP ( Fig . 4 , lanes G , H , I , and K ) . These results demonstrate a high affinity binding site specific for ATP in the 70 , 000 - mol - wt polypeptide , but not in clathrin ( even during uncoating ) , at ATP concentrations relevant to the uncoating activity . As observed for the clathrin - dependent ATPase and clathrin releasing activities ( Table II ) , only ADP was an effective inhibitor ofthe photolabeling of 70 , 000 - mol - wt polypeptide by ATP . The appearance of the 70 , 000 - mol - wt species as an apparent doublet in autoradiography , but not by Coomassie staining , was probably an artifact of the cross - linking procedure , involving an alteration of the electropho - retic mobility of the labeled protein by intramolecular cross - links . This was observed for the bulk protein in the cross - linking experiment of the previous paper ( 18 ) . Preparation of an ATP - Uncoating Protein Complex for Active Site Titration in an Initial Burst Experiment To demonstrate directly that the clathrin - dependent ATPase resides in the 70 , 000 - mol - wt polypeptide chain , we prepared a complex of ATP bound to uncoating protein , and then asked whether this bound ATP was hydrolyzed when clathrin cages were added . This experiment also illustrates the role of this complex as an intermediate in the reaction path - way , and titrates the minimum number of active sites in the uncoating ATPase preparation . Uncoating protein was incubated with [ ' H ] ATP , and then freed of unbound ATP by gel filtration on Sephadex G - 25 . The void volume contained - 0 . 42 mol of nucleotide per mole of 70 , 000 - mol - wt uncoating polypeptide chain . This complex was stable under assay conditions because the bound ATP remained intact during incubations with excess hexokinase and glucose ( Fig . 5 , upper panel , closed squares ) . An equiva - lent amount of free ATP was very rapidly hydrolyzed by hexokinase in a parallel control experiment ( Fig . 5 , closed circles ) . When this ATP - uncoating protein complex was incubated with clathrin cages , the ATP was promptly and nearly quan - FIGURE 4 Affinity labeling of uncoating protein with [ a - " P ] ATP .

( Upper panel ) Titration of active sites and products of a single hydrolytic step of uncoating ATPase . Uncoating protein ( 77 j ug ) was incubated for 3 min at 37°C , 0 . 7 mg / ml in buffer C with a mixture of unlabeled ATP , [ 2 - ' H ] ATP , and [ y - 31P ] ATP . The total ATP con - centration was 6 AM and the final specific radioactivities of ' H and 3zP were 16 Ci / mmol and 2 . 5 Ci / mmol , respectively . Unbound ATP was removed by centrifugation at 4°C through a 0 . 5 - x - 6 - cm Seph - adex G - 25 column equilibrated in buffer C . This was accomplished by applying the incubation to the column ( after having pre - centri - fuged the column at 1 , 000 g for 5 min to remove the void volume ) and then collecting the desalted complexes obtained as the flow - through of a similar centrifugation . These enzyme - ATP complexes were eluted at a protein concentration of 0 . 22 mg / ml , and con - tained ' H and 3zP corresponding to 0 . 42 mol nucleotide per mole of 70 , 000 - mol - wt polypeptide of the bound nucleotide , 67 % was ATP and the remainder ADP . These uncoating protein - ATP com - plexes were then incubated at 37°C in buffer C at a concentration of 75 ug / ml protein either alone ( A ) , with 300 Wg / ml yeast hexoki - nase plus 10 mM glucose ( / ) , or with 0 . 6 mg / ml Triton - washed clathrin cages ( p ) . In parallel , an equivalent concentration of free [ 2 - ' H ] ATP , 1 . 2 AM with a specific activity of 16 Ci / mmol , was incubated at 37°C in buffer C with 300 tug / ml yeast hexokinase and 10 mM glucose ( 0 ) . 1 - tul samples were removed at the indicated times for thin layer chromatographic analysis as described in Ma - terials and Methods . The percent of the ATP isolated in the com - plexes that had been hydrolyzed during incubation is plotted as a function of time . ( Bottom panel ) An entire incubation of enzyme - ATP complex with Triton - washed clathrin cages ( 15 mm at 37°C ) was loaded onto a 0 . 7 x 26 cm Biogel A0 . 5M column and eluted at 2 ml / h with buffer C , collecting 0 . 25 - ml fractions . The elution profile of clathrin heavy chain ( p ) and the 70 , 000 - mol - wt uncoating polypeptide ( p ) was determined by SDS PAGE , Coomassie staining , and densitometry . ' H ( A ) and " P ( 41 ) radioactivity were also mea - sured , representing the products of hydrolysis , [ ' H ] ADP and " P i . titatively hydrolyzed to ADP ( Fig . 5 , upper panel , open cir - cles ) . Very little hydrolysis occurred when the complex was incubated by itself ( Fig . 5 , closed triangles ) . Adding hexoki - nase plus glucose along with clathrin cages to the complex during incubation did not change the rate of ATP hydrolysis observed ( not shown ) . This shows that the ATP molecule must be hydrolyzed in the same site at which it was bound in the complex with uncoating protein . 738 (cid:9) THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY - VOLUME 99 , 1984 This experiment also serves to titrate the minimum number ofactive sites in the uncoating protein preparation . Over 90 % ofthe bound ATP was hydrolyzed in the burst , corresponding to 0 . 42 mol of ATP per mole of 70 , 000 mol wt polypeptide . Therefore , at least 42 % of these protein molecules must have been catalyzing clathrin - dependent ATP hydrolysis . Given this high value , it seems certain that the protein active in uncoating and ATP hydrolysis is the major 70 , 000 - mol - wt species . Clathrin Is Released Free of Nucleotide or Phosphate Derived from ATP What is the fate of the ADP and Pi generated from ATP hydrolyzed in a round of uncoating ? Is any linked to the released clathrin , either covalently or noncovalently ? A com - plex of uncoating ATPase with a mixture of [ 2 - ' H ] ATP and [ y - 32p ] ATP was prepared , and incubated with clathrin cages . The whole incubation was then chromatographed on Biogel A0 . 5M to separate the products of the reaction to enable the fate of the nucleotide to be determined ( Fig . 5 , lower panel ) . Tritium , marking the position of the ADP product and the small amount of remaining ATP , was found bound to the uncoating protein as well as free in the included volume . Phosphorous radiolabel , representing trace residual ATP and the Pi product , was exclusively free in the included volume . No ' H or " P was detected in the fractions that contained clathrin triskelions . We estimate from this data that < 0 . 002 mol of ATP , ADP , or Pi are bound ( covalently or noncova - lently ) per mole of clathrin heavy chain in these fractions . No uncoating enzyme was found associated with triskelions in the gel filtration profile . Evidently , hydrolysis of the stoichi - ometric levels of ATP present in these reactions is not suffi - cient to generate the isolable enzyme - triskelion complexes observed after enzymatic release in the previous paper ( 18 ) . All ofthe ' H associated with the peak of uncoating protein was noncovalently bound , as all of the isotope was acid - soluble and also was not associated with the 70 , 000 - mol - wt polypeptide after SDS gel electrophoresis . A total of 0 . 15 mol of ' H - adenine nucleotide was bound per mole of 70 , 000 - mol - wt polypeptide in these fractions , of which > 95 % was ADP , as determined by polyethyleneimine - cellulose thin layer chro - matography . The remaining [ ' H ] ADP label , like the phospho - rous label , was present as free label in the included volume . Clathrin Packed in a Cage Is the Preferred Substrate for Uncoating ATPase Does the packing arrangement of clathrin influence its ability to be recognized as substrate by uncoating ATPase ? The ATPase assay , unlike the clathrin release assay , affords an opportunity to investigate this issue . Clathrin cages and triskelions can be tested for their ability to elicit the ATPase activity of uncoating protein under the same conditions . This can be accomplished because free triskelions do not assemble into cages to a significant extent under the conditions ( pH 7 . 0 ) employed in the assay ( 13 , 23 ) . As shown in Fig . 6 , cages elicit ATPase activity as expected . But clathrin trimers , pre - pared from these same cages , were at least 15 times less effective , when incubated at the same protein concentration in the same buffer . Moreover , when these triskelions were reassembled into cages by dialysis into buffer A , their ability to elicit ATP hydrolysis from the enzyme was completely restored ( Fig . 6 ) . Thus , the arrangement of clathrin triskelions FIGURE 6 (cid:9) Specificity of uncoating ATPase for assembled clathrin trimers . Assays were performed in 20 id buffer C at 37°C . Each assay contained 10 Ag / ml uncoating ATPase and 0 . 2 mg / ml clathrin protein ( added as cages or triskelions ) . The clathrin cages substrates ( 4p ) had been washed with Triton X - 100 and preincubated as usual ( Materials and Methods ) . Free triskelions ( A ) were prepared from these cages by incubation for 30 minutes at 4°C in 1 M Tris - HCI , pH 6 . 2 , followed by dialysis into 5 mM Tris at pH 8 . 1 . Reassembled cages ( p ) were prepared from these triskelions by dialysis into buffer A for 16 h at 4°C , followed by a preincubation of 10 min at 37°C in buffer B as described in Materials and Methods . in a cage structure is clearly an important factor in the recognition of the clathrin substrate by uncoating ATPase . These seem to be appropriate properties for an enzyme whose substrate is assembled clathrin and whose product is disassem - bled clathrin disassembled clathrin , and would explain why the rate of ATP hydrolysis observed in Fig . 2 declined after most ofthe clathrin had been released . Stoichiometry of ATP - dependent Clathrin Release The ratio of the rate at which clathrin is released to the rate at which ATP is hydrolyzed defines the apparent stoichiom - etry of ATP - dependent clathrin release . Under assay condi - tions optimal for ATP - dependent clathrin release ( buffer C , pH 7 . 0 ) , this apparent stoichiometry is about 3 to 4 ATP hydrolyzed per trimer of clathrin released . ' This may , in fact , represent a minimum estimate since some clathrin may be released in spontaneous events accompanying enzymatic " hits " ( see Discussion of previous paper ) . It is important to recognize that this number may have no absolute significance , apart from the fact that it is small . Indeed , ATP hydrolysis can be readily uncoupled from clathrin release . For example , the pH dependence of the ' To calculate the number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed per clathrin triskelion released , parallel reactions were performed as described in Materials and Methods in buffer C , pH 7 . 0 ( optimal conditions for clathrin release ) . Reactions contained 0 . 5 mg / ml Triton X - 100 - washed ' H - clathrin cages , 20 pg / ml uncoating ATPase , and 7 . 5 / AM ATP , either unlabeled or containing 25 pCi / ml [ ' H ] ATP . The rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined by thin layer chromatographic anal - ysis of the reaction containing [ ' H ] ATP , as described in Materials and Methods . Radioactive clathrin , which remained at the origin , wasresolved from the nucleotides by the developing solvent . Triske - lion release was measured in the reaction containing unlabeled ATP , as described in the accompanying paper ( 18 ) , andconverted to moles using the known clathrin specific radioactivity . The ratio of ATP hydrolysis rate ( pmol / min ) to triskelion release rate ( pmol / min ) under these conditions was 3 to 4 , i . e . , about three to four ATP molecules are hydrolyzed for every clathrin trimer released . clathrin - dependent ATPase ( Fig . 7 , top ) is strikingly different from that reported for ATP - dependent clathrin release in the previous paper .

Below pH 5 . 7 , ATPase activity precipitously declines , probably reflecting denaturation of clathrin cage substrate . This interpretation is indicated because preincubation ofcages of pH values below 5 . 7 reduces their effectiveness as substrate when assayed at pH 6 . 2 , while preincubation of uncoating ATPase at these acid pHs was without effect on assays at pH 6 . 2 . A similar uncoupling of ATPase from release activity could be induced by adding high concentrations of divalent cations ( Fig . 7 , middle ) . The ATPase activity showed a requirement for divalent cation , with a rank order of Mg ` > Mn " > Ca " , as observed for the release activity in the previous paper ( 18 ) . However , unlike the sharp optimum seen at low divalent cation concentrations for the uncoating activity ( Fig . 7 , mid - dle , open circles ) the cage - dependent ATPase activity level was essentially constant over a range of 1 to 16 mM divalent cation concentration . At these higher concentrations , ATP is maximally hydrolyzed unaccompanied by the release ofclath - rin . When uncoupled by either method , several hundred ATPs are hydrolyzed per 70 , 000 - mol - wt polypeptide in the course of a typical incubation of 10 - 20 min . This demonstrates that the uncoating protein ATPase can act catalytically with regard to ATP hydrolysis . The effect of varying KCI on the ATPase activity ( Fig . 7 , bottom ) was similar to that reported in the previous paper for the release activity . DISCUSSION The data reported in this paper suggest that ATP hydrolysis is used to power the removal of clathrin from coats . We have shown that ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and P ; in the process of enzymatic uncoating , and that Cathrin is free of the prod - ucts of this hydrolysis . Several lines of evidence demonstrate that the 70 , 000 - mol - wt uncoating protein , purified on the basis of its ability to dissociate clathrin cages , is responsible for this Cathrin - dependent ATPase activity . First , the clathrin - dependent ATPase activity co - purifies at each step with the uncoating activity . Second , the intrinsic properties of the ATPase and uncoating activities are identical , making it quite probable that they represent alternative measures of a single catalytic sequence : the release of Cathrin from coats coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP . Thus , the Km values for ATP and clathrin cage substrates are , within experimental error , the same for both activities . The specificity for ATP is equally exacting in both cases . Of special note is the inability of dATP to promote Cathrin release or to be hydrolyzed . Third , ATP but not dATP can be cross - linked to the 70 , 000 - mol - wt uncoating protein , and the specificity of this binding site for nucleotide is the same as that for the uncoating and ATPase activities . Fourth , a stable complex of the 70 , 000 - mol - wt uncoating protein with stoichiometric amounts of ATP can be prepared . This ATP is promptly hydrolyzed when Cathrin cages are added . We currently envision that the uncoating ATPase functions in cells by removing Cathrin coats from coated vesicles ( but see the discussion in accompanying paper [ 18 ] for other possibilities ) , thereby facilitating the eventual recycling of clathrin and baring the membrane surface to permit fusion of the transport vesicle . This scheme would work best if uncoat - 740 (cid:9) THE JOURNAL Of CELL BIOLOGY - VOLUME 99 , 1984 ing ATPase could recognize coated vesicles and ignore coated pits . In this regard , it is noteworthy that uncoating ATPase greatly prefers closed cages to free Cathrin triskelions as substrates . It seems appropriate for a protein designed for uncoating to invest energy in a substrate that needs disassem - bly ( cages ) and not in products that are already disassembled ( triskelions ) . The small amount of hydrolysis elicited by tris - kelions could result from transient associations between tris - kelions that are recognized by the enzyme . Uncoating ATPase , as purified , consists of a mixture of monomers and dimers . It is not yet known which species interacts with cages or whether they interconvent during un - coating . A dimeric structure could help uncoating ATPase distinguish assembled from unassembled Cathrin . When Cathrin is packed into cages , sites oflocal dyad symmetry are created on the edges ( 15 ) that would represent natural binding sites for a symmetric protein dimer - sites that are missing from unassembled Cathrin . ATP hydrolysis by uncoating ATPase always requires the presence of Cathrin cages , and is most efficiently used to release Cathrin under approximately physiological conditions ( 1 mM Mg " , pH 7 ) . Clathrin release is never observed in the absence of ATP hydrolysis , even when ADP or the nonhydro - lyzable ATP ( y ) S are present in sufficient concentration to inhibit ATP - dependent release of Cathrin by uncoating AT - Pase . But hydrolysis is readily uncoupled from release when the pH is lowered or the divalent cation concentration is raised . Indeed , conditions have been found ( Fig . 7 ) wherein ATP is hydrolyzed maximally and essentially no Cathrin is released , the ATP hydrolysis occurring in an apparently futile manner . Thus , ATP hydrolysis cannot solely be occurring subsequent to the actual release of a triskelion from a cage . Additionally , the decline of the rate of ATP hydrolysis seen as cage disassembly nears completion ( Fig . 2 ) and the inability of free triskelions to elicit ATP hydrolysis ( Fig . 6 ) suggest that clathrin , once released , loses the ability to elicit ATP hydrol - ysis from the enzyme . This occurs despite the fact that after Cathrin release , enzyme can be found associated with the triskelions ( 18 ) . Preliminary evidence suggests that more than one ATP is used , in more than one step , in forming the isolable enzyme - clathrin complexes during the uncoating of Cathrin cages . This explains why no such complexes were observed in the experiment of Fig . 4 , where the stoichiometric levels of ATP present were completely hydrolyzed to ADP during Cathrin release . As noted in the previous paper ( 18 ) , the conditions most conducive to enzymatic clathrin release are also those that tend to destabilize clathrin - clathrin interactions within the cage structure ( 23 , 25 , 26 ) . We suggested that when physical - chemical conditions favor spontaneous disassembly of cages , fewer enzymatic " hits " will be necessary to promote net disassembly . Likewise , when conditions stabilize clathrin cages , more hits may be needed . Presumably , each enzymatic hit requires the hydrolysis of ATP , so the number of ATPs hydrolyzed per clathrin released would be expected to increase as conditions stabilize cages , as we observe when pH is lowered or Mg ` is raised ( Fig . 7 ) . When cages are stable , most hits will be futile as the clathrin can " snap - back " readily into position in the cage . Indeed , it is probable that the simultaneous efforts ofseveral enzyme molecules or successive catalytic events by a single enzyme molecule are needed to release a Cathrin trimer . The inner segments of triskelions in cages interact with those of three nearest - neighbor triskelions ( 7 ) , suggesting that all three associations might have to be disrupted simultaneously to effect release . Interactions with the outer segments of legs from three next - nearest neighbor triskelions are not needed to maintain stable cages ( 19 , 22 ) but may need to be broken for release . These considerations would certainly account for the requirementfor at least three ATPmolecules to be hydro - lyzed for every clathrin trimer released , even under optimal conditions .
