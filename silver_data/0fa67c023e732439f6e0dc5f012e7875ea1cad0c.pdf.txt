For structure prediction , sequences submitted to the server are parsed into putative domains and structural models are generated using either comparativemodelingor denovo structurepre - diction methods . If a confident match to a protein of known structure is found using BLAST , PSI - BLAST , FFAS03 or 3D - Jury , it is used as a template for com - parative modeling . If no match is found , structure pre - dictions are made using the de novo Rosetta fragment insertion method . Experimental nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) constraints data can also be sub - mittedwithaquerysequenceforRosettaNMR denovo structure determination . Other current capabilities include the prediction of the effects of mutations on protein – protein interactions using computational interface alanine scanning . The Rosetta protein design and protein – protein docking methodologies will soon be available through the server as well . INTRODUCTION Robetta is an Internet service that provides automated struc - ture prediction and analysis tools that can be used to infer protein structural information from genomic data . The server uses the ﬁrst fully automated structure prediction procedure that produces a model for an entire protein sequence in the presence or absence of sequence homology to protein ( s ) of known structure . Robetta parses input sequences into domains and builds models for domains with sequence homology to proteins of known structure using comparative modeling , and models for domains lacking such homology using the Rosetta de novo structure prediction method . Domain predictions and molecular coordinates of models spanning the full - length query are given as results . The server can also utilize nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) constraints data provided by the user to determine protein structures using the RosettaNMR ( 1 – 3 ) protocol . These tools can be used in conjunction with current structural genomics initiatives to help accelerate struc - ture determination and gain structural insight for targeted open reading frames ( ORFs ) . Additionally , since multidomain pro - teins are often difﬁcult to crystallize and many are too large for NMR structure determination , domain prediction using Robetta can aid structural genomics efforts by expanding the pool of targets from which structures can be determined . The Structural Genomics of Pathogenic Protozoa ( SGPP ; http : / / www . sgpp . org ) consortium is currently using an in - house version of Robetta to identify fragments that express and crystallize from ORFs that do not express as a full chain , and to aid structure reﬁnement . Robetta also provides the ability to identify energetically important side - chains involved in the interface of protein – protein complexes using ‘computa - tional interface alanine scanning’ ( 4 , 5 ) . The ultimate goal for Robetta is to provide structural information of sufﬁcient qual - ity to aid research , infer function and assist drug design . Com - parative models are already being used to infer function and guide experimental efforts , and the research ﬁeld as a whole continues to improve as shown in the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction ( CASP - 5 , and CAFASP - 3 for ‘Fully Automated’ ) experiments ( 6 , 7 ) . Robetta was among the top performers in these assessments . METHODS USED Robetta uses a fully automated implementation of the Rosetta software package for protein structure prediction . The Rosetta method is described in detail in references ( 7 – 9 ) and the use of Rosetta in CASP - 5 and CAFASP - 3 is described in references ( 6 , 7 ) . Domain prediction In an attempt to predict structures for full - length protein sequences , Robetta uses a domain prediction method called * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

Ginzu is a hierarchical screening procedure that ﬁrst uses BLAST , PSI - BLAST ( 10 ) , FFAS03 ( 11 , 12 ) and 3D - Jury ( 13 , 14 ) to detect regions in the query sequence that are homologous to experi - mentally determined structures , and then proceeds with multi - ple sequence alignment ( MSA ) based methods to predict putative domains ( Figure 1 ) . The procedure is ordered by the reliability of each method , starting with the most reliable method ( BLAST ) , followed by the next method in terms of conﬁdence level ( PSI - BLAST ) , and so forth . If a match is found , the remaining unmatched portion of the sequence is used as input for the next step . Regions that are homologous to sequences with known structures are modeled using our com - parative modeling protocol . Unassigned regions are either treated as domain linkers if they are less than 50 residues , or are searched against Pfam - A ( 15 ) using HMMER ( 16 ) for regions that are likely to be domains . The ﬁnal step attempts to identify putative domains in the remaining un - covered sequence by using an MSA of the full - length target derived from a PSI - BLAST search against the NCBI non - redundant ( NR ) protein sequence database . The most popu - lated non - overlapping clusters of sequences in the MSA are assigned as domains , and the ﬁnal cut points are determined in unassigned regions at positions that have a high incidence of sequence termini , a strong loop prediction using PSIPRED ( 17 ) and a reduced occupancy of aligned residues . A weak positional preference is also used to place cuts near the middle of unassigned regions . Putative domains from Pfam - A and the MSA - based method are marked for de novo structure predic - tion . These domains may be parsed even further to satisfy size limitations of our de novo protocol ( (cid:1) 200 residue limit ) . A signiﬁcant fraction of domains in the PDB ( Protein Data Bank ) are within this length ( 18 ) . Comparative modeling The comparative modeling method is described in greater detail in a previously published paper ( 6 ) . Rather than simply taking the alignment available from the method used to detect the structural homolog , Robetta attempts to obtain an improved alignment by employing a method , called K (cid:2) Sync ( D . Chivian , manuscript in preparation ) , that utilizes residue proﬁle – proﬁle comparison , secondary structure prediction and information about elements that are obligate to the fold to produce a single default alignment by dynamic programming ( 19 ) . K (cid:2) Sync also parametrically generates an alignment ensemble from which decoy models are selected . Unaligned regions are treated as loops , which are then modeled in the context of the ﬁxed template using the Rosetta fragment inser - tion method ( 20 ) . An energy function is used that includes a gap closure term to ensure continuity of the peptide backbone . Short and medium loops ( < 17 amino acids ) are assembled ﬁrst , the lowest scoring set of loops is added to the template , and long loops are then built . Multiple independent simulations are carried out , and the lowest scoring conformation is selected as the loop combination appropriate to a given alignment . Four models are selected from this ensemble using different variants of the Rosetta energy function , and returned with the default K (cid:2) Sync alignment - derived model . De novo structure prediction and Mammoth Robetta uses a slightly modiﬁed version of the de novo struc - ture prediction protocol that has been described previously ( 6 ) . Modiﬁcations to the original method were made to run queries within reasonable timescales for a public server . Like the original protocol , Robetta generates three - and nine - residue fragment libraries that represent local conformations seen in Figure 1 . Ginzu domain parsing hierarchy and modeling protocol . The query sequence is scannedfor matches to knownstructures and regionsthat are likely tobedomains . Sectionsthatarenotcoveredbutarelargeenoughtobeadomain ( at least 50 residues ) are passed on as input for the next step . The order is based on the relative accuracy of each step . Homologous structure searches are performed first , followed by a search against Pfam - A and then parsing based on MSA sequence clusters . Boundaries are assigned so that putative domains without homologous structures are within size limits accessible to the Rosetta de novo protocol . Regions that are homologous to sequences with knownstructuresareusedforcomparativemodeling . MatchestoPfam - A , MSA cluster domains and remaining uncovered regions of sufficient size are subjected to de novo structure prediction . Domain models are assembled into a full model in the last step .

Robetta generates 10 000 decoys for the original query and 5000 decoys for up to two sequence homologs . Then 2000 query decoys and 1000 decoys of each homolog are selected based on score and on whether they pass ﬁlters that eliminate decoys having too many local contacts or unlikely strand topologies . The selected decoys are then clustered based on C a root - mean - square deviation ( RMSD ) over all ungapped positions . The top 9 cluster centers are chosen as the top ranked models , and the best scoring model that passed the ﬁlters described above is chosen as the 10th model . Searches with these ﬁnal models are then carried out against a repre - sentative set of PDB chains to ﬁnd similar structures using Mammoth ( 21 ) to identify potential similarities to proteins of known structure . Mammoth identiﬁes the longest structural superposition between the model and proteins in the PDB and reports a Z - score ( 22 ) , which represents the likelihood of getting a similar length match between similarly sized pro - teins by chance . The results of these searches will be used in a conﬁdence function that will be added in a future version . Domain assembly and side - chain packing If a query is parsed into multiple domains , the ﬁnal step in our structure prediction procedure is to assemble the domain mod - els into a continuous full - length structure . Robetta uses an iterative domain assembly protocol that starts with the N - term - inal domain , and attempts domain association by fragment insertion in the putative linker region assigned by Ginzu using the same scoring method as in our de novo protocol . If the chain contains more than two domains , the third domain is added to the previously assembled model , and the procedure continues until the whole chain is assembled . Although we are working on improving this method , this ﬁnal step must be considered as an aesthetic treatment since it was benchmarked using high - resolution crystal structures , and is likely to be inaccurate for low - resolution models . Once the chain is com - pletely assembled , the side - chains of the ﬁnal model are repacked using a Monte Carlo algorithm ( 23 ) with a back - bone - dependent side - chain rotamer library ( 24 ) . RosettaNMR A user can provide experimental NMR constraints data for RosettaNMR structure determination . The RosettaNMR method is described in already published papers ( 1 – 3 ) . The protocol used by Robetta is slightly different from the pub - lished methods . Robetta uses the same method as RosettaNMR to generate fragment libraries that are consistent with chemical shifts , NOE constraint data and , if sufﬁcient data exist , resi - dual dipolar couplings . The fragment libraries are then used with the same RosettaNMR de novo fragment insertion method that utilizes the constraints data in its scoring function to generate decoys . However , at this point , the protocols diverge . Robetta continues its de novo protocol of clustering decoys , and selecting cluster centers and the lowest scoring decoy for the ﬁnal models , instead of choosing just the top scoring models followed by model reﬁnement as RosettaNMR does . Because of this , results with Robetta are likely to be slightly less accurate . Interface alanine scanning Robetta includes a ‘computational interface alanine scanning’ ( 4 ) method that predicts the effects of truncation mutations on the stability of protein – protein complexes as described in refer - ences ( 4 , 5 ) . In short , the procedure identiﬁes residues that are involved in the protein – protein interface , and uses a simple free energy function to calculate the changes in the binding free energy upon single substitutions of each side - chain to alanine . In a test set of 233 mutations in 19 protein – protein complexes , 79 % of the residues identiﬁed as energetically important and 68 % of neutral residues were correctly predicted .

A URL to download results is emailed to the user when the job completes . Since the fragment libraries are large ( on the order of megabytes ) , they will be removed from the server a week after the job completes . STRUCTURE PREDICTION PERFORMANCE AND LIMITATIONS The performance of Robetta has been evaluated in the CASP - 5 and CAFASP - 3 experiments , and is continually benchmarked using LIVEBENCH ( http : / / bioinfo . pl / LiveBench ) ( 35 ) . Robetta’s performance in CASP - 5 and CAFASP - 3 has been discussed in previous publications ( 6 , 7 ) . In general , Robetta compared quite favorably with the other servers for the homol - ogy modeling and fold recognition targets , and did a reason - able job with its de novo protocol for the remote fold recognition and new fold targets . A thorough evaluation of the comparative modeling protocol used by Robetta for LIVE - BENCH will be discussed in another manuscript ( D . Chivian , manuscript in preparation ) . Robetta’s performance on de novo predicted domains in LIVEBENCH 7 and 8 is summarized in Table 1 . Since de novo structure predictions can still not be done with high accuracy , we use two relatively generous deﬁ - nitions of correct predictions in the table . First , a domain is considered to be correctly modeled if at least 1 of the 10 models has a Mammoth alignment of 50 or more residues with an RMSD of 4 A˚ or less to the native structure ( deﬁnition I , upper part of Table 1 ) , or second , a Mammoth Z - score of 6 or greater to the native structure ( deﬁnition II , lower part of Table 1 ) . Under both deﬁnitions , Robetta produces correct predictions for more than half of the domains , and does particularly well with domains that consist of either all - alpha or alpha - beta secondary structure . Domains with all - beta secondary struc - ture containing anti - parallel b – sheets and within the length range of 151 – 200 residues were also modeled well . Domains with < 100 residues were usually incorrect due to errors in domain predictions . There are many limitations to consider when using Robetta , as with all structure prediction methods . The de novo protocol is optimized for small single domain proteins ( < 120 residues ) . Within this limit , models are frequently around 3 – 7 A˚ RMSD to more than half of the native structure . Above this limit , models are still likely to have at least 50 residues within 4 A˚ RMSD , as shown in Table 1 . For comparative modeling , the quality of the model is greatly dependent on the correct selec - tion of the best possible parent template and alignment . Because of these factors , results are highly dependent on the accuracy of the domain assignments . A general rule to follow is that BLAST , PSI - BLAST , FFAS03 and 3D - Jury parent detections should be considered the most reliable , in that order . Domains predicted from Pfam - A and the MSA should be treated with caution , particularly for longer domains and also those that were assigned solely by the MSA . THROUGHPUT Robetta is computationally demanding and requires signiﬁ - cantly sized computer clusters for structure predictions to be made on a reasonable timescale . Therefore , to try to meet demand , Robetta was designed to run on computer clus - ters that may be distributed regionally as mirrors . It takes Robetta around 4 – 6 h to run a 150 residue query on a single cluster of about 80 CPUs . With two mirrors of similarly sized clusters , Robetta is currently able to process around 10 normally sized jobs per day . Because of this computational demand , users are only allowed to submit one sequence to the job queue at a time . Once a job is submitted for structure prediction , the time it takes to complete the job depends on the length of the query , the number of jobs already queued and the number of available CPUs . This time is estimated in days for every job and is listed in the queue table to give users an idea of when jobs will ﬁnish . Domain predictions in the absence of 3D - Jury and fragment libraries are far less demand - ing , and take around 15 – 30 min on a single processor . Com - putational alanine scanning is a quick procedure that takes just a few minutes to run on a single CPU . FUTURE WORK We plan to broaden the scope of the Robetta server by adding protein design ( 36 ) and protein – protein docking ( 37 ) capabil - ities which have been developed in our laboratory as part of the Rosetta software package . We are also planning to add con - ﬁdence values for our de novo structure prediction results derived from a function similar to one used in a previous study ( 38 ) . Comparative modeling options will be added that will allow users to provide their own starting templates . We hope to improve Robetta’s throughput by expanding the distributed network of cluster mirrors . Table 1 .
