For this reason , multidisciplinary approaches to research are becoming more popular . Some recent examples include applying physics techniques to the study of biological phenomena [ 1 ] , deriving an understanding of the nature of critical phenomena from renormalization techniques in particle physics [ 2 ] drawing inferences about the early universe from findings in terrestrial superfluid experiments [ 3 ] , and using statistical physics to analyze technological and social systems [ 4 ] . In an effort to move beyond anecdotal evidence of the benefit of interdisciplinary discourse for science , in this paper we study the dynamics of groups , or ‘‘communities’’ , of ideas using a statistical physics approach . We attempt to quantify the evolution of ideas and subdisciplines within physics as they emerge , interact , merge , stagnate , and desist . The quest for describing the development of scientific fields is not new . There have been epidemiological [ 5 , 6 ] and network - based approaches ( citation and collaboration net - works ) [ 7 – 15 ] aiming to gain insight into the spread of scientific ideas . Recently the temporal evolution of several scientific disciplines have been modeled with a coarse - grained approach [ 16 ] . Here we build a scientific concept network consisting of American Physical Society PACS numbers as nodes representing scientific concepts . The American Institute of Physics ( AIP ) develops and maintains the PACS scheme as a service to the physics community in aiding the classification of scientific literature and information retrieval . Two PACS numbers are linked if there exist publications that reference them simulta - neously . Our approach differs from previous methods in that it provides a direct , unsupervised description of scientific fields and uses techniques such as community finding and tracking from the field of network physics . This approach provides means to quantify how ideas and movements in science appear and fade away . Because this method makes it possible to measure the current and past state of the relationship between scientific concepts , it may also help to make predictions about the future of science and thus inform efforts to guide its development . In this paper , we entertain some of the quantitative questions that this method permits ; specifically , we seek to answer questions about the relationship between size , lifetime , and activity of scientific fields . Various local to global topological measures have been introduced to unveil the organizational principles of complex networks [ 17 – 19 ] . One such measure that allows the discovery of organizational principles of networks is community finding . There have been a number of methods to find the communities in networks which describe the inherent structure or functional units of a network [ 20 – 23 ] . One of these is CFinder , a clique percolation method ( CPM ) introduced by Palla et al . [ 21 ] , which finds overlapping communities and is especially suitable for studying the evolution of scientific fields since scientific concepts are often shared among multiple fields . We use this CPM to track the evolution of physics . Results Building the Network Data were collected from the American Physical Society’s ( APS ) Physical Review database from 1977 – 2007 . Journals included in the study are Physical Review Letters , Physical Review { A through E } , and Physical Review Special Topics : Accelerators and Beams . Papers in this database contain a list of author - assigned PACS codes , where each PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 May 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 5 | e10355 PACS code refers to a specific topic in physics . PACS itself is hierarchical , which is evident in the structure of the codes with up to 5 levels of topic specification . For example the PACS code ‘64 . 60 . aq’ has 5 levels where the first digit ‘6’ represents the first level ( in this case ‘condensed matter’ ) , ‘4’ represents the second ( e . g . ‘equations of state , phase equilibria , and phase transitions’ ) , the third and fourth digits ‘60’ together represent the third level ( e . g . , ‘general studies of phase transitions’ ) while the last two characters ‘aq’ carry information pertaining to the fourth and fifth levels of specification ( e . g . ‘specific approaches applied to phase transitions’ and ‘networks’ , respectively ) . PACS codes are not static , rather , the coding scheme is periodically updated with the addition and deletion of codes . In order to ( at least partially ) account for this effect , the scientific concept network was constructed such that the nodes in the network represent individual PACS codes using the first four digits of specification , where changes to scheme are less probable . This network and the related material is available on our website [ 24 ] . In our network , an edge occurs between two nodes if the two PACS codes they represent are cited in the same paper ; one paper in the database often contributes many nodes and edges to the network . Furthermore , edges are weighted by the number of papers that contain that edge . We introduce two measures , node and edge cutoffs , to control for noise in the network ( see Methods section ) . The entire PACS network from 1977 – 2007 after both noise measurements were applied has 803 nodes and 23707 distinct edges . The degree of a node is the number of edges shared by the node . The weighted cumulative degree distribution follows a stretched exponential with the form , P k ð Þ * exp { k = 842 ð Þ 0 : 53 h i as shown in Fig . 1A . The distribution has a similar form in the unweighted case . The dynamic classification scheme of the American Physical Society , implemented by the addition , splitting and removal of codes , may be preventing the formation of large hubs , thus keeping the specification of the codes more useful . The stretched exponential distribution may be the result of a sublinear - linear attachment type growth [ 25 ] . The PACS network also exhibits a weak but apparent hierarchical structure measured by the dependence of the clustering coefficient on ( unweighted ) degree . For a node i , the clustering coefficient is given as C i ~ 2 n i = k i k i { 1 ð Þ , where n i is the number of edges that link the neighbors of node i , and k i is the degree of the node . The clustering coefficient for a node is the ratio of the number of triangles through node i over the possible number of triangles that could pass through node i [ 26 ] . A purely hierarchical network will have a S C T that scales as a power of k , S C T * k { 1 , while a random network will have a clustering coefficient that is constant with k [ 26 ] . For this network , S C k ð Þ T * k { 0 : 29 , shown in Fig . 1B . This dependence is not surprising given the hierarchical structure of the classification scheme . Defining Communities in Physics Papers published between 1985 and 2006 were used to study the community evolution of the network ; 1985 appears to be the first year when all journals present ( Physical Review E began publication in 1993 ) consistently used the PACS data scheme , and 2007 was thrown out to exclude incomplete data from the analysis . The journal Physical Review Special Topics : Accelerators and Beams was not included because of an irregular publishing schedule . After the noise measures were carried out , the edge weights were no longer used , and the network became an unweighted network with respect to the community evolution analysis . The data were organized into 44 time bins , with each bin representing a 0 . 5 year time period . Once a paper ( and the edges and nodes it contains ) appears in the analysis , it is assigned a lifetime , l , of 0 or 2 . 5 years . This assignment is an attempt to more realistically capture the nature of scientific dissemination , as well as the delay in time from publication to assimilation by the field . The analysis of community evolution begins at the time bin subsequent to the lapse of the assigned lifetime . Thus the first time bin , t ~ 0 , for a paper lifetime of l ~ 2 : 5 refers to the latter half of 1987 since we start the analysis in 1985 . In order to study the evolution of different fields in physics , one must first find these fields in our network . We hypothesize that scientific fields are represented by communities in our PACS network . These communities are found using the CFinder algorithm , which is based on a clique percolation method [ 21 ] . Figs . 2 and 3 present examples of the community structure extracted utilizing CFinder . Figure 1 . Measurements on the PACS network from 1977 – 2007 .

Its name , specified by the PACS scheme , is then used to label the community . If a community has multiple codes which compose the same largest fraction of nodes in that community , then the community is assigned multiple labels . As shown in Figs . 2 and 3 , we observe that the analysis captures expected scientific connections among fields in physics . For example , in 1997 , particle physics is linked to both general relativity and astrophysics . It is also worthwhile to note the emergence of biophysics as a community in the 2005 analysis . Community Evolution and Dynamics In order to track the evolution of scientific fields , after identifying communities at each individual time interval , it is necessary to match the communities between adjacent time steps . We implemented a community evolution algorithm developed by Palla et al . [ 27 ] to match the communities between time bins ( see Methods section ) . To gain a better understanding of the dynamics of evolving communities , we defined two properties of each community : size and activity . A value for each of these measures can be assigned to every community for each individual time bin . The size s of a community is the number of nodes contained within that community at time t . Size can be interpreted as a measure of a community’s breadth : communities with a small size encompass only a few distinct ideas , while large communities encompass many distinct ideas . ( The cumulative size distribution was calculated for different times and is displayed in Fig . S1 . ) The activity a of a community is defined as the number of papers that contain at least one node from that community at time t . As one expects , there is a strong correlation between size and activity ( see Fig . S2 ) . Next , we study the relationship between the age or lifetime of a community versus its size and activity . The age of a community at time t is simply the number of time bins the community has been present in the evolution analysis : t ~ t { t 0 z 1 , where t 0 is the time bin in which the community was born . In order to study the Figure 2 . The scientific concept network for the first half of 1997 . Nodes corresponding to scientific fields , as well as node labels and their corresponding fields , are shown in the same color . The size of the nodes corresponds to the number of PACS codes contained in that community . Same - color neighboring nodes have the same label . The thickness of the edges correspond to the number of shared PACS codes between communities ( the weight of the edge ) . The community structure is shown at t ~ 9 : 5 years , corresponding to first half of 1997 , using CFinder with l ~ 2 : 5 years . Labels are assigned by looking at the first two digits of the PACS codes that make up the largest fraction of each community . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0010355 . g002 Evolution of Scientific Fields PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 3 May 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 5 | e10355 dependence of age on size , in each time bin , the current age t and size s are recorded . Using all communities from all time intervals , the median age is calculated for communities with the same size as shown in Fig . 4A . There is a trend of t increasing with size s . Thus , it would appear that older communities tend to contain more nodes , and that longer lived fields tend to encompass many distinct ideas . Values for both the Pearson correlation coefficient , p , and the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient , r , were calculated between t and s using the raw , unbinned data . r ~ 1 { 6 P i d 2 i N N 2 { 1 ð Þ where N is the number of data points and d i is the difference in the statistical rank of the corresponding values for each data point . For l ~ 2 : 5 , the Pearson correlation coefficient was p ~ 0 : 4772 while the Spearman’s r was calculated to be r ~ 0 : 5913 . In order to measure the dependence of age on activity , the current age t is recorded along with the current activity a of every community in each time step . Because of the wide range of possible values for activity and noise in the data , the values of a are sorted into 100 equally sized bins . The median age is calculated for all communities within the same activity interval . There is a trend of t increasing with activity as shown in Fig . 4B which can be partially understood by the strong correlation between size and activity . Further we note an apparent phase transition in activity ; as shown in Fig . 4B after some critical value , communities tend to be longer lived . This transition also appears for l ~ 0 ( see Fig . S3 ) . Lifetime as a function of size , t s ð Þ , for l ~ 0 is shown in Fig . S4 . Again , the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient were calculated for l ~ 2 : 5 using the raw , unbinned data between t and a , with p ~ 0 : 3283 and r ~ 0 : 3764 . Discussion In this paper , we have developed an approach that enables the quantitative study of the evolution of physics fields , specifically by following the dynamical connections between various ideas within physics . From our investigation , we have shown that long lived communities tend to be larger , and are associated with a higher number of papers . Our approach opens up an interesting possibility of being able to predict community dynamics and impact from the current network structure . Furthermore , this method can be easily adapted to other scientific fields using different databases . One such is the INSPEC database which has comprehensive coverage of research activity in computer science and engineering in addition to physics , and has an expert - assigned classification scheme rather than author - based assignments . Materials and Methods Noise Measures A node cutoff is introduced such that in a given time interval a node must appear at least twice to be included in the network . This measure eliminates many of the typographical errors occurring in the database . The edge cutoff , however , takes into account the random expectation of two PACS codes co - occurring in the same paper . For this cutoff , the weight of an edge between nodes i and j , W ij , which is the number of papers that both codes i and j appear in , is compared to the weight expected at random , E ij ~ n i n j (cid:2) N , where n i and n j are the number of papers containing nodes i and j respectively , and N is the total number of papers Figure 3 . The scientific concept network for the first half of 2005 . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0010355 . g003 Evolution of Scientific Fields PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 4 May 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 5 | e10355 present in the time interval . If W ij (cid:2) E ij w 1 : 2 , then the appearance of the edge is significant compared to random appearance , and we include it in the network . CFinder The CFinder algorithm is described in detail in Ref . [ 21 ] . A community is defined as a union of all k - cliques ( complete subgraphs of size k ) that can be reached from each other through a series of adjacent k - cliques ( where adjacency means sharing k { 1 nodes ) [ 21 ] . Picking a k value For this study , k ~ 9 was principally used ( for l = 2 . 5 ) because it appears to produce a large number of communities while discouraging the formation of giant communities . Further , by keeping k constant , we keep the resolution constant for the entire analysis . Picking an appropriate k value for the analysis is done by considering two properties : the number of communities present , and the presence of overly large communities [ 21 ] . It is desirable to have a large number of communities , so as to increase the statistical quality of measurements made on the network . Fig . S6 plots the number of present communities for each time step for k ~ 8 , 9 , and 10 , for l ~ 2 : 5 . As demonstrated , the number of communities found using the choice of k ~ 10 tends to be less than the other parameter choices , making it less favorable in terms of improving statistical quality . A k value must also be large enough to avoid the introduction of overly large communities that obscure the actual community structure of the network [ 21 ] . To quantify this property , we use the quantity r which is the ratio of the size of the largest community to the second largest community for a given time bin . Thus while some distribution in the sizes of communities is necessary , r should not be overly large . Fig . S7 plots the measure r against all time bins for l ~ 2 : 5 . For k ~ 8 , the values of r tends to be larger than ( signifying giant communities ) than those calculated from the other two parameter values , making it an unfavorable parameter choice . Community Matching The community matching algorithm is described in detail in Ref . [ 27 ] . In this analysis , an appropriate k - value is used rather than a constant edge - weight cutoff . A running stationarity measure is described in Appendix S1 and Figure S5 . The merger of two communities is described in Appendix S1 and Figures S8 and S9 .
