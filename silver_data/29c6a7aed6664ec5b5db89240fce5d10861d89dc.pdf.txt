Abstract : The co - existence of angel , independent venture capital ( IVC ) , and corporate venture capital ( CVC ) in the en - trepreneurial finance market raises a natural question of why a start - up finances its projects from one source over another . This question becomes more complicated to address because a start - up grows or declines dynam - ically . Using a life cycle theory of entrepreneurial finance , which suggests that a start - up uses several financing sources as it reaches certain thresholds in its life cycle accordingly , I explore this selection issue with my dataset on 113 biopharmaceutical start - ups . I find that these start - ups tend to finance their projects mostly from solely IVCs or CVCs rather than angels and syndicated investors combining IVCs and CVCs when they have more preclinical and phase I products in their R & D pipelines ; and from CVCs or syndicated investors rather than angels and IVCs when they do more phase II and phase III products .

This gap in the early stages of product development has grown due to several factors , including increasing regulatory burdens , concerns about coverage and payment for new medical innovations , and uncertainties related to intellectual property policies ( Pharma 2015 ) . As a result , these start - ups heavily rely on several forms of private capital for financing , including independent venture capital firms ( IVCs ) , corporate venture arms of established corpo - rations ( CVCs ) , and business angels . 1 Given the high cost of drug development ( e . g . , on average $ 1 . 0 billion in 1990s and $ 2 . 6 billion in 2000s ) , it is extremely rare to observe a start - up that is able to grow and survive without funding from these sources . The co - existence of several forms of entrepreneurial financing sources raises interesting questions of why a start - up finances its projects from one over another ; and more importantly , how this choice evolves as it grows . A growing body of literature has suggested that each entrepreneurial financing source has its own motives and investment patterns as well as a range of services they provide to start - ups ( see Figure 1 ) . These questions , however , remains not fully answered because start - ups dynamically face several unique options for funding in their life cycles within a comprehensive set of investor groups . For example , a strand of literature has recently focused on a comparison of IVCs and CVCs ( B vs . C in Figure 1 ) . However , we know little about how a start - up particularly evolves in choosing a certain type of investors in its life span and how other types of investor groups , including angels and syndicated investors combining IVCs and CVCs , are involved with these dynamic financing decisions . Apparently , these issues are involved with a start - up ’ s growth strategy and outcomes . As a result , these questions should be examined within a comprehensive picture of entrepreneurial financing sources in a dynamic manner . In a broad sense , these issues help us understand why several types of investors co - exist in the entrepreneurial finance market .

Conditional on entering the direct financing market , a start - up can make a series of financing choices among four representative entrepreneurial financing sources , including business angels , IVCs , CVCs , and syndicated investments combining IVCs and CVCs . I map the current liter - ature by these financing sources in this figure . The branches , including A , B , C , and D , represent financing sources . For example , the Dushnitsky and Shapira ( 2010 ) paper is mapped to B vs . C . That is , the paper finds a performance gap be - tween IVCs and CVCs , and this performance gap is sensitive to CVCs ’ compensation scheme . My study is the first , to my knowledge , to holistically consider the linkages between a start - up ’ s product development stages within its R & D pipeline and four entrepreneurial financing sources . It is also the first paper to demonstrate the importance of a start - up ’ s product development stages in a context where a start - up evolves to choose financing sources . To address these issues , I elaborated on two research streams . The first is the literature on the entrepreneurial finance market ( see several issues in the market , including alternative sources of capital , financial contracting issues , public policy , and the dynamics of private equity returns in Denis ( 2004 ) ) . The central idea of this liter - ature is that each type of investors has its own investment motives and arrangements . A prominent example is offered by the literature on CVC activities , which claims that , unlike IVCs , CVCs can provide not only financial capital but also quick access to markets , technological assistance , and product recognition through marketing , distribution , and research support for start - ups ( Park and Steensma 2011 ; Bertoni , Colombo , and Grilli 2013 ) . This unique attribute of CVC may attract start - ups in several ways that IVCs may not be able to emulate . In contrast , the interests of CVCs and start - ups may be more misaligned when compared to those of IVCs and start - ups due to the desire of CVCs to use the start - ups ’ resources for their own sakes ( Hellmann 2002 ; Katila , Rosenberger , and Eisenhardt 2008 ; Dushnitsky and Shaver 2009 ; Maula , Autio , and Murray 2009 ; Pahnke , Katila , and Eisenhardt 2015 ) . Furthermore , business angels may differ IVCs and CVCs in several ways . First , angel investors are recognized to be more readily available relative to CVCs and IVCs ( Gompers 1995 ; Kaplan and Strömberg 2001 ; Wong , Bhatia , and Freeman 2009 ) . Second , IVCs and CVCs often add value to start - ups by exerting complementary assets and increase the chance of R & D success . However , angels generally do not have such complementary assets ( Chemmanur and Chen 2014 ) and the amount of individual investment is often smaller than that of IVCs and CVCs . Some angels take advantages for start - ups over other investors by making their investment decisions through a well - documented process and , in some cases , formal votes ( Kerr , Lerner , and Schoar 2014 ; Puri and Zarutskie 2012 ) . In addition , the unique investment patterns and benefits of syndicated investors combining both IVCs and CVCs simultaneously have been intensively discussed in the existing literature ( Bygrave 1987 ; Dushnitsky and Shapira 2010 ; Lerner 1994a ; 1994b ) . Figure 1 illustrates these four entrepreneurial financing sources and maps to prior literature . The second research stream I considered is the literature on a life cycle theory of entrepreneurial finance ( Puri and Zarutskie 2012 ; Hellmann and Thiele 2015 ; Dutta and Folta 2016 ) . This perspective has focused on a central question of what extant early - stage financiers have a substantial impact on the start - ups in which they have invested . This strand of literature suggests that the combination of intensive monitoring , provision of value - added services , and powerful control rights leads to improved governance and operations in portfolio firms , lower capital constraints , and ultimately stronger firm growth and performance ( Kerr , Lerner , and Schoar 2014 ) . Particularly , this literature has examined on how this active role of investors can be characterized in the early part of start - ups ’ life cycles and the eventual differences in outcomes ( Schwienbacher 2013 ; Vanacker , Meuleman , and Manigart 2014 ; Dutta and Folta 2016 ) . The empirical documentation of this impact along with start - ups ’ life cycles – from birth to death – has been challenging due to the lack of available data and theoretical guidance . This study uses a setting from the biopharmaceutical industry where collaborative relationships between ge - netic engineering based start - ups and their investors are common . There are several reasons that facilitate these collaborative relationships . These reasons include addressing the most complex scientific challenges , overcom - ing regulatory hurdles , and avoiding the high uncertainty of reimbursement of sunk cost . As a result , start - ups seek the necessary capital and complementary assets to exploit their growth opportunities , whereas investors look for investment opportunities to utilize their resources and enhance the rates of return , which are not always necessarily capital gains . Moreover , biopharmaceutical start - ups have common and distinguishable product de - 2 A u t o m a t i c a ll y g e n e r a t e d r o u g hP D F b y P r oo f C h e c k f r o m R i v e r V a ll e y T e c h n o l o g i e s L t d DEGRUYTER Kang velopment stages within their R & D pipelines , including preclinical , phase I , phase II , phase III , and launched stages . Given technology is often the most important resource for a start - up , the advancement of these stages become essential factors that match the start - up with potential investors . Since technology is multifaceted and heterogeneous by its nature , these stages can be a suitable index to suggest the comprehensive status of a start - up ’ s focal technologies . The synthesis of the above frameworks and setting allows me to empirically analyze a start - up ’ s selection on financing sources in a dynamic manner . Using a dataset on the funding activities of 113 biotechnology start - ups , I find that a start - up tends to finance its projects from CVCs , IVCs , angels , and syndicated investors combining CVCs and IVCs in order when it develops more preclinical products ; from IVCs , CVCs , angels , and syndicated investors when it does more phase I products ; from syndicated investors , CVCs , IVCs , and angels when it does more phase II products ; from syndicated investors , CVCs , angels , and IVCs when it does more phase III products . By attempting to address the dynamics of a start - up ’ s financing sources , this study contributes to several strands of the literature . Firstly , this study provides a linkage between a start - up ’ s life cycle theory and available financing options in the entrepreneurial finance market based on a dynamic perspective . In doing so , this study provides systematic evidence that suggests that a start - up strategically utilizes various financing sources to fulfill necessary resources as it reaches critical thresholds in its life cycle . This evidence is essential to formulate and expand the boundary of a life cycle theory of entrepreneurial finance that has been inexplicitly defined in the existing literature ( Puri and Zarutskie 2012 ; Hellmann and Thiele 2015 ; Dutta and Folta 2016 ) . Secondly , this study explicitly examines a comprehensive set of investor groups that include angels and syndicated investors along with CVCs and IVCs . As a result , this study , in a broader sense , contributes to spec - ify the objectives of entrepreneurial financing market where several types of investors co - exist simultaneously ( Lerner 1994a ; Chemmanur and Chen 2014 ; Dushnitsky and Shapira 2010 ) . Given my findings that support a life cycle theory of entrepreneurial finance , these several types of investors are complementors rather than substitutors by adding value to a start - up in a timely manner ( e . g . , a certain product development stage ) and thus their co - existence is justified . Furthermore , this study contributes to the literature on optimal corporate relations and financing arrange - ments for a start - up ( e . g . , Hellmann 2002 ; Katila , Rosenberger , and Eisenhardt 2008 ; Dushnitsky and Shaver 2009 ) . This line of studies has been focused on a potential tension between resource constraints and appropri - ation problems that may affect a start - up ’ s decision regarding financing sources . In sum , my findings suggest that the status of a start - up ’ s product development process plays a crucial role in accessing to several types of investors . This dynamic feature of my findings extends the prior literature that compares the advantages and disadvantages of each financing sources in a static manner . As a start - up matures , it responds technological and managerial changes and become an active decision maker to procure the necessary resources . 2 Theory and Hypotheses 2 . 1 Related Literature A start - up is often resource - constrained and needs to reach out beyond its boundary in order to procure crit - ical resources from the external environment ( Park and Steensma 2011 ; Bertoni , Colombo , and Grilli 2013 ) . To reduce uncertainty in obtaining needed resources , a start - up may restructure its dependency with a variety of tactics , including seeking alternative sources of supply , building inter - firm networks , and improving its position to absorb constraints ( Burt 1983 ; Casciaro and Piskorski 2005 ) . My theoretical framework assumes that a start - up chooses a certain type of investors exactly in this manner . An attempt to obtain external financing becomes increasingly successful as a start - up has more available options and a superior position in the entrepreneurial financing network surrounding it ( Lerner , Shane , and Tsai 2003 ) . Prior studies have suggested that each type of investors is important and differ from another in various con - texts ( see Figure 1 that maps prior studies ) . Business angels are often individual investors and finance smaller amounts than institutional investors , including IVCs and CVCs , generally do , but their total financing amount in the industry is larger than that of institutional investors ( Freear , Sohl , and Wetzel 1995 ) . Both angels and institutional investors may be able to add value to start - ups , yet the value of angels added for start - ups is still controversial in the literature . For example , on the contrary to the assumption regarding the incapability of an - gels to provide value - addition for start - ups ( e . g . , Chemmanur and Chen 2014 ) , Kerr , Lerner , and Schoar ( 2014 ) document that start - ups funded by prominent angel groups experience superior outcomes to their counter - parts in terms of survivals , exists , employment , patenting , Web traffic , and financing . Moreover , Dutta and Folta ( 2016 ) suggest that institutional investors and business angels contribute equally to the innovation rates 3 A u t o m a t i c a ll y g e n e r a t e d r o u g hP D F b y P r oo f C h e c k f r o m R i v e r V a ll e y T e c h n o l o g i e s L t d Kang DEGRUYTER of start - ups and these effects are non - additive . However , institutional investors backed start - ups have more impactful innovations and experience faster commercialization rates . CVCs and IVCs also significantly differ in several ways . Firstly , unlike IVCs that pursue mainly capital gains , CVCs often seek investment opportunities to redirect and guide their parent companies ’ R & D activities using knowledge spillovers originating from start - ups . Apparently , IVCs want to maximize the rate of returns from their investments and this is exemplified by 20 . 7 % of net return to investors after fees and other costs between 1986 and 2008 ( Cambridgeassociates . com ) . In contrast , technology spillovers pursued by CVCs come from ex - posure and early access to the technologies and products being developed by portfolio firms , allowing the parent companies of CVCs to adjust their future R & D activities and strategic agendas ( Dushnitsky and Lenox 2005 ; Dushnitsky and Lenox 2006 ) . Secondly and by the nature of CVCs , CVCs have a relatively high possibility to misappropriate a start - up ’ s technology for their own sakes , yet IVCs have a minimal risk of misappropriation ( Katila , Rosenberger , and Eisenhardt 2008 ; Dushnitsky and Shaver 2009 ) . There is a potential tension formed between start - ups ’ resource needs and appropriation concerns . Start - ups are pushed toward raising funds for their projects from CVCs due to their dependence on CVCs for needed resources ; and they are also pushed away from CVCs because of concerns about the possible damaging misappropriation of their own resources by CVCs ( Katila , Rosenberger , and Eisenhardt 2008 ; Maula , Autio , and Murray 2009 ) . In these strands of literature , it is not fully examined how a start - up ’ s product development stage impacts its choice on financing sources and how this choice evolves as the product development process proceeds . This examination is important because technology is often the most important resource pursued by a start - up and it is dynamic by the nature . In particular , I argue that a start - up may select a type of investors according to the availability of investors and the nature of complementary assets provided by investors . These two factors can evolve along with a start - up ’ s product development cycle . This perspective also extends prior studies that are based on the arbitrary role of investors in matching between investors and investees ( e . g . , Fulghieri and Sevilir 2009 ; Hellmann 2002 ) . A start - up may be able to be an active decision - maker depending on the technological status . Some observations in the literature have indirectly indicated this possibility . For example , an investor does not always get its first - choice investment opportunity ( Gompers 2002 ; Hsu 2004 ; Santos and Eisenhardt 2009 ) and often pays much more by investing in overvalued transactions ( Benson and Ziedonis 2010 ; Gompers and Lerner 2000a ) . In addition , a start - up has the greatest flexibility to choose among potential investors or simply avoid investment ties with some investors ( Katila , Rosenberger , and Eisenhardt 2008 ; Maula , Keil , and Zahra 2013 ; Stuart , Hoang , and Ralph 1999 ) . 2 . 2 Hypotheses Development As a start - up accumulates its technology in its life cycle , it is likely to become more competent to complete its product development process by reducing uncertainty around the technology , allowing it to become an at - tractive investee or have a wider range of investor pool in the entrepreneurial finance market . Moreover , the accumulation of technological expertise enables a start - up to better understand and recognize the value of the technology and the nature of necessary resources for future uses . As a start - up enters into a more matured development stage , it is more likely to search local and neighborhood information , and elicit its existing knowl - edge stores to achieve an immediate advantage ( Levinthal and March 1993 ) . This notion is consistent with some empirical evidence in the biopharmaceutical industry ( e . g . , Rothaermel and Deeds 2004 ) . This self - reinforcing practice makes a start - up more efficient in optimizing its financing arrangements , reducing the costs of under - taking such initiatives and allowing a start - up to become more attractive ( Dyer and Singh 1998 ; Basu , Phelps , and Kotha 2011 ) . Hence , it is assumed that a dynamic relationship between a start - up ’ s technological progress and a suitable pool of investors exists in a start - up ’ s life cycle ( Schwienbacher 2013 ) . In the biopharmaceutical industry , there are common and distinguishable product development stages de - fined by the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) drug review process ( see Table 5 ) . The drug develop - ment stages are classified into the preclinical , phase I , phase II , and phase III . 2 The transition probabilities for advancing to the next stage are 0 . 71 , 0 . 44 , and 0 . 69 in Phase I , II , and III ( Grabowski and Kyle 2008 ) . This process from discovery to approval is uniquely long , averaging between 10 and 12 years , compared with an average of 6 – 18 months in other high technology sectors ( Griffin 2002 ) . These unique characteristics , including long prod - uct development process and a great amount of necessary capital , costly prohibit a start - up from developing a drug by completely itself . A start - up is likely to need a different resource set to proceed its product development in each stage . For example , drug discovery often starts with ideas for a drug target and a lead molecule in the preclinical stage . The choice of target ( e . g . , a cell surface receptor involved in sending messages into the cell nucleus or a messenger molecule that binds to receptors as a ligand ) is driven by a start - up ’ s understanding of the biology of a particular disease . Once a lead compound has been identified , a start - up proceeds to the preclinical stage , which comprises 4 A u t o m a t i c a ll y g e n e r a t e d r o u g hP D F b y P r oo f C h e c k f r o m R i v e r V a ll e y T e c h n o l o g i e s L t d DEGRUYTER Kang various tests in vitro as well as in relevant animal models . These earlier steps in the product development process are multi - year processes and often requires millions of dollars , which is a comparably smaller amount of cost relative to the following clinical stages . As a start - up reaches a certain threshold of technological progress , its position in the entrepreneurial finance market becomes better to finance its projects and the necessary amount of capital becomes larger , too . As noted , a start - up needs to finance relatively a smaller amount of capital in the preclinical stage , com - pared with the following clinical stages , including phase I , phase II , and phase III . As a result , a business angel can be a suitable financing source in this stage because it is more readily accessible than institutional investors are and tends to provide a smaller amount of capital ( Puri and Zarutskie 2012 ; Hellmann and Thiele 2015 ; Dutta and Folta 2016 ) . As a start - up proceeds its development process , it becomes to need more financial and non - financial resources beyond the ranges that angels can provide ( Jensen 1993 ) . Consequently , angels are not likely to become a suitable type of investor in the following clinical stages . However , some angels exceptionally continue to finance in the following stages by joining with an angel group that combines individual angels ’ commitments and thus invests a greater amount of capital . In essence , an angel ’ s availability and commitment captures a conventional wisdom that a start - up tends to finance its project from angels in its early stage of prod - uct development process . This start - up continuously seeks financing opportunities from institutional investors as it proceeds to the following product development stages . Hypothesis 1 A start - up is more likely to finance its projects from business angels in the early stages of product development cycle ( e . g . , preclinical stage and phase I ) and less likely to do in the following stages of product development cycle ( e . g . , phase II and phase III ) . Due to the complexity of uncertainty , it is not feasible for any start - up to identify and study a target and lead compound internally ( e . g . , in - house ) . For example , a start - up cannot resolve exogenous uncertainty ( e . g . , technological advancements in relevant fields ) with its own effort , and thus needs to focus its process to resolve endogenous uncertainty . In contrast , internal uncertainty can be resolved within collaborative networks that include incumbent pharmaceutical corporations ( i . e . , CVCs ) . These corporations also play as an alternative financing source and may contribute to resolve exogenous uncertainty by providing complementary assets for drug approval process , industrial networks , marketing channels , and necessary human capital ( Park and Steensma 2011 ) . CVCs often seek investment opportunities to pursue not only capital gains but also technology spillovers from exposure and access to external technologies . These technology spillovers may redirect and guide their internal R & D activities through observing the technological trajectories mapped by start - ups , resolving their own technological challenges . Given these mutual needs between CVCs and start - ups , CVCs become a suitable type of investors to finance a start - up ’ s project in the early stage of product development ( e . g . , preclinical stage and phase I ) . In these stages , CVCs can preempt the focal technology by becoming a stock holder of the start - up , whereas the start - up can start to build industrial networks that help proceed the following development stages . This match is impacted by technological complementarity between two partners ( Ceccagnoli , Higgins , and Kang 2014 ) . This notion is consistent with the recent finding ( Alvarez - Garrido and Dushnitsky 2015 ) that start - ups backed by CVCs experience higher rates of innovation outputs , compared to those backed by IVCs ; and the performance of these start - ups is sensitive to their ability to FDA approval requirements as the mechanisms associated with CVC contribution . As a start - up reaches a certain threshold ( e . g . , phase II and phase III ) , CVCs still may want to have a better position in the relationship with start - ups to utilize their down - stream assets . These assets include research facilities , distribution channels , marketing experiences , and necessary resources to facilitate a drug approval process . These down - stream assets are specified in the current research programs , which are in part replaced by a genetic engineering based product development process . As long as a start - up ’ s technology is promising enough to justify CVCs ’ time and attention , CVCs will be willing to invest in the start - up for such strategic motives . This start - up also needs complementary assets provided by CVCs to successfully complete its product development process and eventually launch the product in the market . In the later stages , a promising start - up has a wider pool of investors ( Hsu 2004 ) and is able to attract CVCs , too . In addition , there is a greater chance that a start - up finances its project from syndicated investors combining CVCs and IVCs in the later stages . These syndicated investors may lead to better decisions about whether and where to invest in by reducing information asymmetries ( Sah and Stiglitz 1986 ; Adamati and Pfleiderer 1994 ) . Syndicated investments are preferred by both types of investors because investors want to have a chance to check out their own thinking against other knowledgeable resources ( Perez 1986 ) . Syndicated investments also provide a greater pool of capital for current and follow - on cash needs as well as technological and managerial supports , which are often complementary to each other . Hence , I predict : Hypothesis 2 A start - up is more likely to finance its projects from CVCs in the early stages of product development cycle ( e . g . , preclinical stage and phase I ) and continue to finance its projects from solely CVCs or syndicated investors combining CVCs and IVCs in the following stages of product development cycle ( e . g . , phase II and phase III ) . 5 A u t o m a t i c a ll y g e n e r a t e d r o u g hP D F b y P r oo f C h e c k f r o m R i v e r V a ll e y T e c h n o l o g i e s L t d Kang DEGRUYTER Unlike CVCs that are willing to finance a start - up in all the stages of product development cycle , IVCs are more likely to invest in the early stages of it due to their own structure and services provided for a start - up . IVCs raise capital from limited partners to organize their funds . These funds typically have a fixed life of 10 years and are compensated with a fraction of the capital gains as well as fixed management fees ( Sahlman 1990 ; Alvarez - Garrido and Dushnitsky 2015 ) . Within this typical structure , IVCs ’ payoffs are determined by a start - up ’ s market potential , which often positively correlated with uncertainty residing in completing the product development process . As a result , IVCs necessarily seek investment opportunities in a niche market characterized by high uncertainty and possibly high rates of return ( Amit , Brander , and Zott 1998 ) , which captures a start - up that pursues the early stages of product development process . It is also noteworthy that the value of managerial supports provided by IVCs is more salient for a start - up in the early stages of product development process . Specifically , there are three types of the managerial supports : monitoring , professionalization , and certification ( Denis 2004 ) . 3 As a start - up reaches a more matured threshold in its product development cycle , these managerial supports become less important and a different set of resources ( e . g . , resources for the drug approval process and marketing channels ) is more importantly required to successfully complete the product development process . These resources may be directly provided by CVCs in an efficient manner ( Gans , Hsu , and Stern 2002 ) rather than IVCs that can ’ t emulate these services . As IVCs become less capable investors in the later stages of product development process , they may want to seek syndicated investment opportunities with CVCs . These investments are not likely to provide a chance of “ swing for the fence ” but a higher chance of harvesting by subsequent exits . Hypothesis 3 A start - up is more likely to finance its projects from IVCs in early stages of product development cycle ( e . g . , preclinical stage and phase I ) and continue to finance its projects from syndicated investors combining CVCs and IVCs rather than solely IVCs in the following stages of product development cycle ( e . g . , phase II and phase III ) . 3 Data and Empirical Method 3 . 1 Data To test my hypotheses on the dynamics of a start - up ’ s financing decisions associated with its R & D stages , I col - lected a set of longitudinal financing records of biopharmaceutical start - ups from the Deloitte ReCap database between 1985 and 2006 , which was a period of significant expansion in external fundraising activities in this industry ( e . g . , MacMillan et al . 2008 ; National Venture Capital Association 2010 ) . This database collects data on biotechnology based start - ups ’ financing and alliances from three primary sources : biopharmaceutical com - pany press releases and other literature ; U . S . Securities and Exchange Commission filings ; and company pre - sentations made at investment conferences and other public meetings . This collection includes all the start - ups that have actively operated during the period regardless whether they successfully have gone IPOs or not . By including both successful and failed start - ups , this study focuses on what biopharmaceutical start - ups actu - ally do rather than what they should do . No one of publicly available biopharmaceutical databases , including SDC database , MERIT - CATI database , and Bioscan database , can be considered to contain the population of financing and alliance activities . However , out of the many databases , the Deloitte ReCap is the most suitable database in terms of the consistency of coverage and completeness ( Schilling 2009 ) . A subset of this database tracks round - by - round financing records through the entire life cycles of start - ups from founding to final dispo - sition over 700 biopharmaceutical start - ups . This information includes financing records from any individual investors ( i . e . , angels ) , private equity investors ( i . e . , IVCs ) , equity alliances with incumbents ( i . e . , CVCs ) , and other investors such as hospitals , universities , and research labs . I include start - ups that had any financing records found from any source in their entire life cycles . Since this study is focused on the entire cycle of prod - uct development , which takes , on average , 10 to 12 years and often contains a time period of a start - up ’ s IPO , I also included financing records after a start - up goes public . For each of the start - ups , I reconstructed its drug pipeline using data from the PharmaProjects database . PharmaProjects is a proprietary database ( https : / / citeline . com / products / pharmaprojects ) containing informa - tion updated monthly on drugs in development since 1980 . Each drug profile in the database includes the drug ’ s current status , the original materials , the primary therapy , the primary indication and other indications , route of administration , the name of the developing firm , the country where it is being developed , the novelty rating , and other information . PharmaProjects is compiled from both published and unpublished sources , including information obtained directly from the companies involved in product development . In order to characterize several dimensions of a start - up ’ s technology I utilized patent data obtained from the NBER U . S . Patent Citations Data File , which tracks the change of patent ownership in the sample period . This source helps create variables related with a start - up ’ s patenting activities , including patents , forward citations , 6 A u t o m a t i c a ll y g e n e r a t e d r o u g hP D F b y P r oo f C h e c k f r o m R i v e r V a ll e y T e c h n o l o g i e s L t d DEGRUYTER Kang and backward citations . The role of patenting is particularly relevant in this industry given that a start - up is highly likely to patent its inventions to protect its intellectual property ( Cohen , Nelson , and Walsh 2000 ) . Variable descriptions and the source of information are presented in Appendix A . All the nominal values are deflated by the Current Consumer Price Index ( CPI - U ) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and are in constant 2006 U . S . dollars . The synthesis of multiple data sources , which do not contain all the observations cross the sources , makes several missing observations . Finally , my sample contains 1306 fundraising activities involved with 113 biopharmaceutical start - ups , corresponding to 261 business angels , 170 IVCs , 296 CVCs , and 26 syndicated investors containing both CVCs and IVCs , and 553 other investors . 3 . 2 Dependent Variable : Financing Source For an outcome variable of my analysis , the dependent variable is the financing source ( i . e . , 𝑦 𝑖 ) , which denotes each type of investors in the funding round . 𝑦 𝑖 = 1 corresponds to a start - up ’ s financing from angles with the time subscript omitted ; 𝑦 𝑖 = 2 does from IVCs ; 𝑦 𝑖 = 3 does from CVCs ; 𝑦 𝑖 = 4 does from syndicated investors containing CVCs and IVCs ; 𝑦 𝑖 = 0 does from other investors . As a result , my dependent variable becomes a discrete variable and the distribution of this variable is presented in Table 2 . Major CVCs and IVCs are presented in Appendix B ; and sample distribution over time is presented in Appendix C . In the definition of variable , it is noteworthy that 𝑦 𝑖 = 4 does not denote simply multiple investors in the funding round , but denotes syndicated investors containing both CVCs and IVCs in the group of investors . For example , my data indicates that 243 rounds are financed by more than one investors ( i . e . , multiple investors ) , but only 26 out of those 243 are financed by syndicated groups that contain both CVCs and IVCs .

However , I am fortunately able to use a specific drug approval process administered by U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in my setting . Since the revenue streams of biopharmaceutical firms are dependent upon the flow of new products , I used data from drug pipelines to measure the progress of product development process . The drug pipelines , by nature , may represent the dynamics of a start - up ’ s lifespan . Within a start - up ’ s R & D pipeline I count the number of drugs being developed in each stage , including preclinical stage , phase I , phase II , and phase III at year t . Thus , my key independent variables are a set of number of products in four stages . These variables provide several advantages to test my hypotheses . First , this measure directly estimates a start - up ’ s technological progress ( e . g . , dynamics in a start - up ’ s growth ) by focusing on the outcomes of R & D activities . Second , unlike financial accounting variables , this measure can be applied to any start - up regardless of its IPO status . Finally , this clinical development process is a common path to commercialize any product in the in - dustry as well as consume most product development costs . For example , preclinical drug discovery accounts for approximately 32 % of the costs for a new drug , and clinical development ( i . e . , phase I through phase III ) accounts for approximately 63 % ( Paul et al . 2010 ) . While I believe this set of variables is suitable to estimate a start - up ’ s technology status in my setting , this measure also has a concern to be used . Given that the unit of analysis entails each start - up ’ s development capability of varying sizes , I should carefully control for any potential size - effects on a start - up ’ s financing choices and influential outliers in the following empirical analysis . To address these concerns I have also created a set of normalized variables that correspond to the number of products in each stage . For example , ratio of products ( preclinical ) is calculated by the ratio of the number of products in the preclinical stage to total number of products in all the stages at t . The ratio variables in the following stages are created in a similar manner . 3 . 4 Control Variables 3 . 4 . 1 Start - Up ’ s Age Age can help firms become more efficient in such a way that learning can occur as a by - product of day - to - day activities ( Bhak and Gort 1993 ) . This condition , if unobserved , may be confounded with my variables of interest . I compute age by the number of days from a start - up ’ s founding to t , divided by 365 . 3 . 4 . 2 Patents Some studies have reported that a start - up ’ s patenting capacity is positively correlated with the amount of its external financing received ( e . g . , Baum and Silverman 2004 ; Mann and Sager 2007 ) . Thus , I estimate patents by using a start - up ’ s patent stock at t ( Hall , Jaffe , and Trajtenberg 2005 ) and include it in the following analysis . 3 . 4 . 3 Citations Forward citations are the citations that a patent receives from subsequent patents . The number of forward citations has been shown to be positively related with the value of patents and often used to control for the potential value of a start - up ’ s technology in the literature ( Dyer and Singh 1998 ) . Since the value of technology is heterogeneously distributed and impacts a start - up ’ s financing decisions , I control for it using forward citations that counts a start - up ’ s forward citation stock at t . In contrast , backward citations that a patent cites previous patents are involved with technological uncer - tainty that may serve as a proxy for a reciprocal for commercial potential in high - technology sectors ( Iansiti 1995 ; Krishnan and Bhattacharya 2002 ) . This uncertainty is likely to be higher for technology that is more basic 8 A u t o m a t i c a ll y g e n e r a t e d r o u g hP D F b y P r oo f C h e c k f r o m R i v e r V a ll e y T e c h n o l o g i e s L t d DEGRUYTER Kang or more distant from commercialization ( Ziedonis 2007 ) . I estimate this nature of technology using backward citations that counts a start - up ’ s backward citation stock at t ( Lanjouw and Schankerman 2001 ) . The greater backward citations represent the more matured technology , and vice versa . 3 . 4 . 4 External R & D A start - up that has already participated in a wide range of industrial networks with external R & D activities is likely to pursue a financing opportunity existing within the networks . I control for the distribution of external R & D experiences using external R & D that is estimated by the stock of collaborative research alliances , licensing contracts , and other types of technological alliances at t . 3 . 4 . 5 Funding Amount and Cumulative Funding Amount Since investors have a heterogeneous distribution of funding capacities , I control for funding amount measured by the log of amount of financing in million U . S . dollars . More specifically , unlike institutional investors who manage the pooled capital on behalf of other investors in the funds , an angel often invests its own fund so its investment is typically much smaller than that of institutional investors ( Gompers 1995 ) . Consequently , a start - up that seeks a greater amount of capital is likely to exploit a funding opportunity from institutional investors . These growth effects are controlled by using cumulative funding amount that is calculated by the log of cumulative amount of financing in million U . S . dollars . 3 . 4 . 6 Financing Experience , Prior CVC , and Prior IVC Due to the learning effects , a start - up that has previously financed from a certain type of investors is likely to access the same type of investors ( Cooley and Smith 1998 ) . I control for this path dependency using a set of variables , including financing experience , prior CVC , and prior IVC . Financing experience is estimated by the number of prior fundraising activities at t . Prior CVC and prior IVC are indicator variables that equal to one if a start - up has previously financed from IVCs ( i . e . , prior IVC ) and CVCs ( i . e . , prior CVC ) , and zero otherwise . 3 . 4 . 7 Firm and Year Fixed Effects I include two fixed effects estimators , including firm and year fixed effects , in the following analyses . Firm fixed effects are a set of dummy variable that corresponds to each firm and control for time - invarying factors such as a start - up ’ s origin ( e . g . , university or corporation spinoff or endogenous entrepreneur ) , founding team char - acteristic , and project characteristic ( Schwienbacher 2013 ; Vanacker , Meuleman , and Manigart 2014 ) . Year fixed effects control for any variation in the outcome that happen over time and that is not attributed to explanatory variables . This variable corresponds to each t . 3 . 5 Empirical specifications To test my hypotheses , I utilize several econometric approaches based on multinomial logit regression . The multinomial logit regression , which has been popular due to its simplicity and applicability , generalizes lo - gistic regression to more than two possible discrete outcomes ( Greene 1993 ) . In this specification , I estimate the following model : ( 𝑦 𝑖 = 𝑗 | 𝑍 𝑖 ) = 𝑒 𝑍 𝑖 𝛿 𝑗 ∑ 5 𝑘 = 1 𝑒 𝑍 𝑖 𝛿𝑘 , 𝑗 ∈ { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 0 } , where 𝑦 𝑖 denotes financing source , and 𝑍 𝑖 are explanatory variables . The independent variables of interest are a set of variables that estimate the number of products being developed in each R & D stage , including number of products ( preclinical ) , number of products ( phase I ) , number of products ( phase II ) , number of products ( phase III ) , number of products ( launched ) . Control variables in - clude age , patents , forward citations , backward citations , external R & D , funding amount , cumulative funding amount , financing experience , prior IVC , prior CVC , and firm and year fixed effects . This approach , however , provides only supportive evidence because it may violate the independence of irrelevant alternatives ( IIA ) assumption applied in the multinomial logit specification ( Manski and McFadden 1981 ) . For example , both CVCs and IVCs are scarce relative to angel financing ( Freear , Sohl , and Wetzel 1996 ; Prowse 1998 ) so a start - up may first finance its projects from an angel and subsequently finance from CVCs and 9 A u t o m a t i c a ll y g e n e r a t e d r o u g hP D F b y P r oo f C h e c k f r o m R i v e r V a ll e y T e c h n o l o g i e s L t d Kang DEGRUYTER IVCs . Given this sequence of decision making , the components of error terms of IVCs and CVCs financing can be correlated , violating the IIA assumption . As a corollary and unreported analysis , I performed the IIA test by adding or deleting alternative outcome categories and found that this practice does not affect the odds among the remaining outcomes . As a result , the multinomial logit specification becomes suitable in our setting . To provide a better visualization , I provide the rank orders of financing sources that a start - up is likely to choose in each product development stage . Since the regression coefficients of multinomial logit regressions are not easily interpreted , this rank can provide an intuitively understandable result . In addition , I perform a test if a set of independent variables of interest are statistically significant . This test is necessary to confirm whether or not the R & D stages of start - up are necessarily related with the decision making on financing sources . To refine the issue of the unit of analysis involved with a start - up ’ s number of products of varying sizes , I use a set of normalized measures in the next sensitivity analysis . This set of variables include ratio of products ( preclinical ) , ratio of products ( phase I ) , ratio of products ( phase II ) , ratio of products ( phase III ) , and ratio of products ( launched ) . As noted , these variables are estimated by the ratio of the number of products in each stage divided by the total number of products in all the stages at t . 4 Empirical Findings 4 . 1 Descriptive Statistics The descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1 . In Panel A , all sample includes 1306 entrepreneurial financing activities and are categorized into five groups along with the outcomes of financing source , including 𝑦 1 ( Angel ) , 𝑦 2 ( IVC ) , 𝑦 3 ( CVC ) , 𝑦 4 ( Syndication ) , and 𝑦 0 ( Other ) . The columns report the distribution of observations and the summary statistics along with a set of independent variables , including number of products ( preclinical ) , number of products ( phase I ) , number of products ( phase II ) , number of products ( phase III ) , and number of products ( launched ) . For the completeness of analysis number of products ( launched ) is included in the following empirical analyses . The first column reports the distribution of observations : 𝑦 1 is 261 observations and 20 % of the sample ; 𝑦 2 is 170 observations and 13 % of the sample ; 𝑦 3 is 296 observations and 23 % of the sample ; 𝑦 4 is 26 observations and 2 % of the sample ; and 𝑦 0 is 553 observations and 42 % of the sample . The small portion of angel financing , relative to that in other high - tech industries , is probably due to the nature of biopharmaceutical industry where a large amount of product development cost , which is often beyond the range of angels , is required to complete the product development process in a highly uncertain setting . As noted , a syndication is defined as an investor group that contain both IVCs and CVCs . A group of investors who fall into either type of IVCs or CVCs is categorized into each type . This narrow definition allows me to have a small portion of syndication in my sample . The proportions of IVCs and CVCs are slightly lower than those of 63 other high - tech industries , which are , on average , 20 % to 30 % ( Guo , Lou , and Perez - Castrillo 2011 ) . This occurs because other types of investors , including universities , leading labs , and hospitals , actively invest in the product development process that is closely involved with scientific discoveries in this industry . The following columns indicate a notable pattern that the number of products being developed within a start - up ’ s R & D pipeline is diminished as the stage of product development proceeds . This pattern is commonly observed regardless of funding resources . It is noteworthy that 𝑦 1 and 𝑦 3 have a considerably greater number of products in preclinical stage followed by 𝑦 2 and 𝑦 4 , which is consistent with hypotheses 1 and 2 . In contrast , 𝑦 2 has more products in phase I than 𝑦 1 does , indicating that a start - up is more likely to finance its projects from IVCs in phase I as predicted in hypothesis 3 . It is also notable that 𝑦 3 has considerably a greater number of products than any other groups throughout all the product development stages ; and 𝑦 4 does in phase II and phase III . These statistics are collectively consistent with my predictions made in hypotheses 1 , 2 , and 3 . Due to the nature of industry that necessarily takes long time and requires various complementary assets in the product development process , CVCs and syndicated investors play a central role in providing necessary assets and capital for start - ups . However , these statistics need to be interpreted with caution because they are simply univariate results and may be biased due to unobserved heterogeneity . Panel B reports summary statistics for the five groups of variables used in the following analysis . These groups include financing selection , products within R & D stages , firm characteristics , financing characteristics , and fixed effects that control for time - invarying and yearly factors . It is notable that a set of ratio of products is diminished as a start - up ’ s product development process proceeds . This is consistent with the pattern shown with a set of number of products . This consistency in part reduces a concern of normalization issue . Firm characteristics and financing characteristics provides a set of dimensions of sample . Start - ups in the sample are , on average , 6 . 34 - years old and have , on average , 15 . 91 stock of patents at t . These statistics indicate that my sample are typically young and actively pursue patenting capacities when they finance their projects from external sources . These 10 A u t o m a t i c a ll y g e n e r a t e d r o u g hP D F b y P r oo f C h e c k f r o m R i v e r V a ll e y T e c h n o l o g i e s L t d DEGRUYTER Kang start - ups have experienced , on average , 13 . 56 alliances , 6 . 03 prior funding rounds , and raised $ 8 . 28 million U . S . dollars per round . The correlations of all the variables are presented in Appendix D . 4 . 2 A Start - Up ’ s Financing Choice Table 2 presents my benchmark results obtained from multinomial logit regressions . To ensure model identifi - cation in the regressions 𝑦 0 is set to a base group and its regression coefficients ( e . g . , zeroes ) are not presented in the table . All the regression coefficients should be interpreted by comparing with those of base group ( i . e . , zeroes ) and across other groups . The absolute magnitudes of regression coefficients are not always meaning - ful . For example , in Model 1 that includes all the control variables , a positive regression coefficient of age in 𝑦 1 ( i . e . , 0 . 086 ) can be interpreted that a start - up tends to finance its projects from 𝑦 1 rather than 𝑦 0 as it becomes older . Since the regression coefficient of age in 𝑦 3 is negative ( i . e . , − 0 . 116 ) and smaller than those in any other groups , it indicates that a younger start - up tends to finance its projects from 𝑦 3 rather than any other groups , suggesting that CVCs actively pursue investment opportunities in young start - ups in this industry . Patents in - dicate significant and positive regression coefficients in 𝑦 2 and 𝑦 3 . This result is consistent with a notion from biopharmaceutical industry executives that a start - up ’ s patenting capacity is necessary to attract investments from IVCs and CVCs . This result is not necessarily consistent in the contexts of other high - tech industries that have much quicker product development processes and possibly develop designing around patents .

The base group is 𝑦 0 . * * * , * * , and * denote significance at 1 % , 5 % , and 10 % , respectively . Model 2 includes a set of independent variables of interest and indicates that a start - up that has greater number of products ( preclinical ) has a significantly greater regression coefficient in 𝑦 3 , at the conventional levels , followed by 𝑦 2 , 𝑦 1 , and 𝑦 4 in order . In other words , a start - up that has more products being developed in the preclinical stage tends to finance its projects from CVCs , most likely , followed by IVCs , angels , and syndicated investors in order . The regression coefficients of number of products ( phase I ) are greatest in 𝑦 2 followed by 𝑦 3 , 𝑦 1 , and 𝑦 4 in order . These results suggest that a start - up that has more products in phase I is more likely to finance its projects from IVCs followed by CVCs , angels , and syndicated investors in order . This pattern is similar with that shown with number of products ( preclinical ) except that IVCs and CVCs are replaced with each other . Hence , these results are consistent with my predictions made in hypotheses 2 and 3 that a start - up is more likely to finance its projects from CVCs and IVCs in early stages . However , these results do not support hypothesis 1 . This inconsistency occurs possibly , as noted , due to the nature of industry where a greater amount of product development costs is required and this amount is often beyond the range angels can provide . There is an obviously distinguishable pattern with number of products ( phase II ) . The regression coefficients of number of products ( phase II ) is great in 𝑦 4 followed by 𝑦 3 , 𝑦 1 , and 𝑦 2 . This transition of orders continues with number of products ( phase III ) except that 𝑦 1 and 𝑦 2 are replaced with each other . These results suggest that a start - up that has more products in later stages tends to finance its projects from syndicated investors and solely CVCs , supporting hypotheses 2 and 3 . Number of products ( launched ) indicates a similar pattern of that of number of products ( preclinical ) in which a start - up tends to finance its projects from solely either one of IVCs or CVCs . This pattern suggests that a start - up that has launched a product regresses toward its financing pattern in the early stage of product development process . Combined together , this setting collectively provides systematic evidence to support hypotheses 2 and 3 . However , it doesn ’ t support hypothesis 1 . For a better visualization , the ranks of regression coefficients across 𝑦 𝑖 along the product development stages are provided in Table 3 . In Panel A , 𝑦 3 is most likely to finance a start - up that has a greater number of product in the preclinical stage followed by 𝑦 2 , 𝑦 1 , and 𝑦 4 . As noted , this pattern is similar with that with number of products ( phase I ) . With number of products ( phase II ) 𝑦 4 is most likely to finance a start - up that develops a great number of products in phase II followed by 𝑦 3 , 𝑦 2 , and 𝑦 1 . This pattern continues with number of products ( phase III ) . Table 3 : Post estimation of multinomial logit regressions .

For a corollary analysis , Wald tests are used to test a null hypothesis , 𝐻 0 : 𝛽𝑦 1 = 𝛽𝑦 2 = 𝛽𝑦 3 = 𝛽𝑦 4 = 0 , hypothe - sized that parameters estimated in the regressions are all zero in the population . The Wald test assesses 𝐻 0 by considering two pieces of information ( Long and Freese 2003 ) . First , all else being equal , the greater the dis - tance between the estimated coefficients and the hypothesized values , the less support I have for 𝐻 0 . Second , the greater the curvature of the log - likelihood function , the more certainty I have about my estimates . This means that smaller differences between the estimates and hypothesized values are required to reject 𝐻 0 . The test results are presented in Panel B and indicate that number of products ( preclinical ) , number of products ( phase I ) , and number of products ( phase II ) reject 𝐻 0 at the 10 % level ; and number of products ( phase III ) does at 5 % level . Using the alternative set of independent variables , I examine the issue of the unit of analysis in Table 4 . As noted , a set of ratio variables include ratio of products ( preclinical ) , ratio of products ( phase I ) , ratio of products ( phase 13 A u t o m a t i c a ll y g e n e r a t e d r o u g hP D F b y P r oo f C h e c k f r o m R i v e r V a ll e y T e c h n o l o g i e s L t d Kang DEGRUYTER II ) , ratio of products ( phase III ) , and ratio of products ( launched ) , and is used in the same specification presented in Table 3 . Model 1 includes control variables . In Model 2 , a new set of variable indicate overall consistent patterns of regression coefficients with those presented in Table 3 . Ratio of products ( preclinical ) indicates an exactly same order of financing sources as that of Table 3 . Ratio of products ( phase I ) presents the same order of the first two financing sources , including 𝑦 2 and 𝑦 3 , but 𝑦 1 and 𝑦 4 are replaced with each other . Ratio of products ( phase II ) presents a consistent order with that in Table 3 . With ratio of products ( phase III ) the first two financing sources are replaced with each other and so the last two financing sources are , resulting 𝑦 3 , 𝑦 4 , 𝑦 2 , and 𝑦 1 in order . Combined together , my benchmark findings are robust and alleviates a concern about varying size independent variables . 5 Discussion and Limitations In this study , I aimed to examine how a start - up ’ s product development stages and its financing sources are interacted with each other . With several hypotheses that are elicited based on the dynamics of a start - up ’ s life cycle , this study is premised that a start - up needs a different set of resources along with its life cycle and finances its projects depending on its product development stages to procure these resources . In the setting of biopharmaceutical industry , I find systematic evidence that a start - up that has more products being developed in early stages , including preclinical stage and phase I , tends to finance its projects from solely either one of IVCs or CVCs . More specifically , CVCs are more preferred in preclinical stage and IVCs are in phase I . This set of preferences might be determined by the necessary resources that each type of investors can provide for a start - up in an efficient manner . As a start - up ’ s products become more matured and get into later stages , including phase II and phase III , a start - up tends to finance its projects from CVC solely or syndicated investors combining CVCs and IVCs . This transition of financing sources can be occurred because a start - up can access a better pool of investors with reduced uncertainty due to its technological advancements . 5 . 1 Implications in the Biopharmaceutical Industry The biopharmaceutical industry is uniquely characterized by the complexity and length of the product de - velopment cycle and thus an individual firm performance is determined by foremost the products within its R & D pipeline . Given this uniqueness , it is a serious concern that this industry has been suffering from a de - crease of R & D productivity over the past two decades . The decrease of R & D productivity makes down - stream co - specialized assets to be under - utilized for a small range of therapeutic research that has been traditionally focused in the industry . As noted , biotechnology - based start - ups help fill these gaps along the R & D pipeline by providing a new scientific way to cure the focal disease . As a result , pharmaceutical giant companies often become a hub to gather external technologies and commercialize promising products being developed by the biotechnology - based start - ups . By exploring how the entrepreneurial finance market fulfills necessary complementary assets for biotech - nology start - ups in a timely manner , this study provides an alternative way to balance between the attraction of investments in R & D and the price of drugs , which is pursued by the U . S . government . The new administration of Trump government desperately seeks an effective way to reduce drug prices by speeding up the process of bringing new drugs to market and removing regulations ( Newsweek 2017 ) . The rationale is that easing FDA requirement would save several years and millions of dollars off a pharmaceutical company ’ s investment in experimental products . This plan raises concerns from healthcare industry experts immediately because they believe that the market price does not depend on the up - front investment and the government lacks the means to force drug companies to lower prices in parallel with reduced development costs . Moreover , testing new drugs for safety only ( e . g . , what it done in phase I ) and not benefit ( e . g . , what it done in phase II and phase III ) could accomplish the opposite goal and lead to spending more for therapies that have no great outcome . By highlighting an effective financing arrangement to enhance a start - up ’ s R & D pipeline , this study provides an alternative approach to reduce drug prices . This study suggests that a start - up can facilitate its R & D process by fulfilling necessary resources from different types of investors in a timely manner . This positive flow of resources may allow a start - up to reduce technological uncertainties and develop more products in its R & D pipeline . Consequently , more products will appear in the market along with existing drugs that are still ef - fective but inferior to these new products . The competition between these new and existing drugs may generate price discrimination effects in which affordable drugs and high - end quality drugs with higher prices co - exist in the market . This competition effect may pull the drug prices down eventually . Given this set of consequences , the role of government should focus on facilitating a start - up ’ s R & D pipeline and , more specifically , formulate policy ( e . g . , tax policy to attract each type of investors by a start - up ’ s R & D stages accordingly ) to create a better flow of resources for a start - up . 14 A u t o m a t i c a ll y g e n e r a t e d r o u g hP D F b y P r oo f C h e c k f r o m R i v e r V a ll e y T e c h n o l o g i e s L t d DEGRUYTER Kang 5 . 2 Limitations The limitation of this study provides avenues for future research . The scope of this study is limited within the biopharmaceutical industry . To the extent that each industry has its own technological and managerial contexts , the results of this study should be interpreted with caution especially when they are applied in the contexts of other high - tech industries . As noted , a biopharmaceutical start - up often takes a much longer time and greater resources in the product development process than any other high - tech start - ups . Hence , the role of complementary assets provided by investors can be more salient compared with that in other industries . Furthermore , the FDA passes a new product to the market only when this product is proved to be more effective than existing drugs ( e . g . , what it done in phase II and phase III ) . This is also comparable with other high - tech industries that various qualities of products would be marketable without the intervention of government . Moreover , the scope of this study does not include public and indirect financing sources that have their own goals and investment patterns . For example , public financing sources , including governmental research grants and other research grants provided by universities , leading labs , and hospitals , often seek basic studies that focus on “ R ” ( research ) rather than “ D ” ( development ) . This investment pattern may generate a quite dif - ferent consequences from that of private financing activities . Future studies need to fill this gap . In addition , the heterogeneity within investor groups is not considered in this study . For example , investor characteristics , including reputations and experiences , matter to make financing decisions for start - ups . The exclusion of this analysis is mainly because this study focuses on comparisons across investor groups . Given this purpose of study , the heterogeneity within investor groups cannot simply compare across investor groups . Finally , future studies need to utilize more various data sources to refine the results of this study . While this study utilized the ReCap database , there are some other available data sources , including Securities Data Com - pany ( SDC ) , Merit - Cati , Core , and Bioscan databases . Each data source has its advantages and disadvantages that would be suited to specific research topics ( Schilling 2009 ) and no database is fully complete . This occurs because start - ups are not required to report all the funding and alliance activities to any governing body . As a result , the coverage of data sources is not highly consistent and it is impractical to combine all the data sources in a single study due to the prohibitive costs . It is still worthy that future studies examine the consistencies of several dimensions of a start - up ’ s financing and alliance activities across several databases . Appendix A Variable descriptions Variable Description Data source Financing source ( 𝑦 𝑖 ) A discrete variable that equals one if a start - up finances through angels ( 𝑦 𝑖 = 1 ) , two if it does through IVCs ( 𝑦 𝑖 = 2 ) , three if it does through CVCs ( 𝑦 𝑖 = 3 ) , and four if it does through syndicated investments between IVCs and CVCs . If a start - up finances through other investors , including founders , research laps , schools , and governments , it is coded as 𝑦 𝑖 = 0 and used as a base group in the following analyses . Deloitte Recap Number of products The number of products within a start - up ’ s R & D pipeline . This variable is divided into five stages , including preclinical , phase I , phase II , phase III , and launched stages . For example , number of products ( preclinical ) is the number of products in the preclinical stage , and the other categories are as follows . Each stage is used as an independent variable in the following analyses . PharmaProject Ratio of products The ratio of product in each stage to the total number of products plus one within a start - up ’ s R & D pipeline . Similar with number of products , this variable is divided into five stages , including preclinical , phase I , phase II , phase III , and launched stages . For example , number of products ( preclinical ) is calculated as number of products ( preclinical ) divided by the total number of products within a start - up ’ s R & D pipeline ( i . e . , all the five stages ) plus one . The other categories are as follows . Each stage is used as an independent variable in the following analyses .

This figure is important because it allows me to investigate whether or not IVC and CVC financing sources have been available to a start - up over time . If either IVCs or CVCs were extremely scarce during a par - ticular period and not readily available , a start - up ’ s financing choice would be heavily impacted by the availability of each financing source rather than the stages of R & D pipelines I study . If this concern is not the case , I should see a notable pat - tern in which the sample distributions of financing sources move together over time . This figure indicates that the num - ber of samples in financing sources gradually increased together in the 1990s , peaked in the early 2000s , and gradually decreased afterward .

For example , the National Institutes of Health operates the NIH SBIR / STTR Award program to fund life science research - based firms in early stages . However , the amount granted in these programs , totaling $ 0 . 6 billion in 2013 , is incomparable with that of private financing sources , totaling more than $ 10 billion , invested in the biopharmaceutical industry ( https : / / sbir . nih . gov ; PricewaterhouseCoopers 2014 ) . Moreover , the objectives and patterns of investments are different across public and private funding sources . As a result , this study focuses on private entrepreneurial funding sources . 2 Phase I is human pharmacology and requires small trials , recruiting up to about 30 patients . Phase II is therapeutic exploratory ; and it expands trials to patients who have the same type of disease to find out the extent of side - effects , and appropriate usage of drugs . Phase III is therapeutic confirmatory ; and it compares new drugs with the best currently available drugs or treatments and releases them if they pass . 3 The monitoring service represents activities that IVCs serve on oversight role by using the due diligence process and the vote rights in the board of directors ( Kaplan and Strömberg 2001 ) . The professionalization service includes developing a business plan , facilitating strategic partnerships , and developing new businesses . The certification effect helps a start - up raise addition funds by signaling the quality of start - up to the market ( Hsu and Ziedonis 2013 ; Megginson and Weiss 1990 ) . References Adamati , A .
