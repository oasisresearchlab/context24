COFILIN AND ACTIN DEPOLYMERIZING FACTOR PLAY DIFFERENT ROLES IN THE REGULATION OF INTESTINAL BRUSH BORDER STRUCTURE AND SODIUM - HYDROGEN EXCHANGER 3 ACTIVITY by Lucy B . Gao A thesis submitted to Johns Hopkins University in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Engineering in Biomedical Engineering Baltimore , Maryland May , 2015 © 2015 Lucy B . Gao All Rights Reserved ii Abstract The brush border Na + / H + exchanger 3 ( NHE3 ) accounts for most small intestinal Na + absorption which occurs across the surface of microvilli . NHE3 surface expression and activity are acutely regulated by endocytosis and exocytosis . Cofilin - 1 ( COF ) and actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) are highly conserved isoforms of the cofilin family of actin severing proteins . COF / ADF are ubiquitously expressed , though ADF is more primarily expressed in intestinal tissue . We hypothesized that COF and / or ADF are necessary for basal and regulated NHE3 activity by remodeling the terminal web actin structure to allow endocytosis / exocytosis . COF and ADF knockdown ( KD ) cells were engineered with lentivirus ( shRNA ) / puromycin in Caco - 2 cells , a polarized intestinal Na + - absorptive cell line . COF - KD reduced COF by 57±5 % ( p≤0 . 01 ) without altering ADF , while ADF - KD cells reduced ADF by 73±5 % ( p≤0 . 01 ) without altering COF . By transmission electron microscopy , ADF - KD cells had straighter and a greater number of microvilli ( MV ) than control , and COF - KD cells had bent and a fewer number of MV . By immunofluorescence , neither COF nor ADF had a predominantly MV distribution but are expressed sub - apically , laterally , in the nucleus , and throughout the cytosol . NHE3 activity was quantified by measuring pH change by BCECF / fluorometry under basal and inhibited ( adenylyl cyclase elevation by exposure to forskolin ( FSK ) , 25  M ) conditions . COF - KD expressed less NHE3 activity than control cells ( p≤ . 10 ) . ADF - KD showed higher NHE3 activity than control cells ( p≤ . 10 ) . FSK inhibited NHE3 similarly in all three conditions . Conclusions : 1 . Using KD studies we conclude that COF is necessary for microvillar rigidity while ADF normally reduces apical microvillar number . The lack of COF / ADF in MV suggest that they affect the MV through intermediate proteins . 2 . COF normally increases and ADF decreases basal NHE3 activity , but neither are involved in cAMP induced inhibition of NHE3 . Thesis Advisor : Dr . Mark Donowitz Thesis Readers : Dr .

Major goals of the lab include increasing understanding of diarrheal diseases related to inhibition of sodium absorption and developing anti - diarrheal medications based on understanding of regulation of intestinal sodium absorption in cell models . Figure 1 : NHE3 must be expressed at the plasma membrane surface of intestinal cell microvilli in order to perform sodium absorption activity . The mammalian sodium - hydrogen antiporter ( SLC9 ) gene family comprises of 9 isoforms . NHE1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 8 primarily function on the plasma membrane , while NHE6 , 7 , and 9 are located on intracellular organelles . 1 NHE3 is most abundant in epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract and kidney . 2 The NHE3 protein complex is linked to a Cl - / HCO 3 - exchanger to produce neutral sodium chloride ( NaCl ) absorption . 1 This accounts for most Na + absorption that occurs in the renal proximal tubule as well as in the jejunum , ileum , and proximal colon . 3 The sodium to hydrogen exchange stoichiometry is 1 : 1 or 2 : 2 , taking sodium into the cell from 3 the apical extracellular environment and expelling cytosolic hydrogen . 1 Transport activity reaches a maximum at acidic pH and is inactive at alkaline pH ( after working for a period of time ) . 1 Besides its function in absorption of sodium , NHE3 also allows for other nutrient absorption that utilizes the acidic extracellular environment generated by the Na + / H + exchange . 1 1 . 2 Enterocyte Structure Enterocytes are polarized epithelial cells that line the small intestinal villi ( finger - like protrusions of cells that increase surface area of the intestine for greater absorption ) . Their primary function is to absorb nutrients from the intestinal lumen as well as to participate in host defenses and the final digestion of nutrients . Each enterocyte has its own membrane protrusions called microvilli ( ~ 100 nm wide and 1 - 2 μm long ) . Thousands of these microvilli are packed together at the apical surface of each cell to form a “brush border” or “striated border” that covers the epithelium and increases cell surface area , allowing for more efficient absorption through the increased presence of precisely localized plasma membrane proteins ( more area allows for more proteins ) . These proteins are regulated and distributed through complex mechanisms of vesicle membrane trafficking and recycling . Each microvillus is supported by a densely packed bundle of actin filaments that are linked laterally to the membrane and anchored to the tip of the microvillus . Microvilli maintain constant length by undergoing continuous dynamic assembly and disassembly . The plus ends of the actin filaments are at the tips of the microvilli and the minus ends are where the bundles of filamentous actin ( F - actin ) extend into the apical part of the cytoplasm in which it is referred to as the rootlet , tethered to what is known as the terminal web . 4 This terminal web region is a netlike arrangement of seemingly unordered microfilaments , where the actin bundles are stabilized by tropomyosin , interconnected by myosin II , filamin , and spectrin , and linked to the junctional complex and the 4 keratin network . 5 The microvillus cores are cross - linked by plastin ( also known as fimbrin ) , villin , and espin and are attached to the plasma membrane by myosin I and ezrin . 5 Figure 2 : Depiction of segment of small intestine , lined with villi throughout interior . Top right : zoom on villus tip , comprising many enterocytes . Middle left : zoom on intestinal microvilli brush border structure of a single enterocyte ( cell ) . Bottom right : zoom on brush border , which is made up of microvillus , comprising bundled actin core , and terminal web . A mature apical brush border can only be established in completely polarized cells . Cellular polarity consists of distinct , functionally separated apical and basolateral domains . It is not entirely 5 understood how polarity is achieved , but continuous , dynamic apical and basolateral vesicle trafficking and recycling are needed for polarized epithelial cell reconstruction and maintenance . 6 Furthermore , the adherens junctions and the tight junction , which connect neighboring cells to form the tight monolayer sheet , distinguish the apical and basolateral domains and control paracellular transport while preventing the random diffusion of plasma membrane proteins and lipids around the entire cell membrane . Thus , formation of a polarized epithelium and cell : cell junctions must occur via interaction between membrane proteins and the cytoskeleton . 1 . 3 NHE3 Regulation and Trafficking NHE3 is one of the most highly regulated transport proteins , regulated in normal digestive physiology and in disease via changes in endocytosis and exocytosis , associated with changes in surface expression . Active in basal conditions , NHE3 is rapidly inhibited during digestion , allowing digestive enzymes to spread over the digestive / absorptive surface of the small intestine . Later in digestion , NHE3 is stimulated to prevent dehydration as part of the normal digestive process . In most diarrheal diseases , NHE3 is inhibited by processes that mimic the post - prandial inhibition of NHE3 , although in an exaggerated manner . 1 Regulation of NHE3 in digestive physiology is caused by food exposed to the intestinal lumen , releasing neurohumoral substances that are largely intrinsic to the intestine . These neurotransmitters and humoral substances , which act locally as well as systemically , alter NHE3 activity by changing the plasma membrane expression of NHE3 via stimulated endocytosis and / or exocytosis . Examples of this regulation include NHE3 inhibition , which occurs almost immediately after eating via release of cholinergic agonists , mimicked by carbachol , which activates M3 muscarinic receptors that elevate intracellular Ca 2 + and stimulates NHE3 endocytosis , thereby decreasing NHE3 activity . 7 In general , hormones that elevate cAMP will inhibit NHE3 . Oppositely , later during digestion there is activation of α2 - adrenergic agonists , 6 which stimulate NHE3 activity by increasing NHE3 exocytosis and increasing the amount of brush border NHE3 . As another example of how NHE3 is regulated , lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) , which is part of the inflammatory repair response and also elevates intracellular Ca 2 + , stimulates NHE3 activity by increasing exocytosis . 8 Epidermal growth factor and dexamethasone have also been found to stimulate NHE3 exocytosis , likely through regulation of the linkage of NHE3 to the actin cytoskeleton . 9 , 10 Glucocorticoids stimulate NHE3 by phosphorylation which initiates exocytotic trafficking to the plasma membrane . 11 NHE3 protein complexes form on its C - terminus , which acts as a scaffold to build the complexes . 1 In addition to binding to NHE3 , some of the proteins in the NHE3 complexes are also fixed to the cytoskeleton actin core of the microvillus of intestinal epithelial cells . These proteins include the ezrin / radixin / moesin ( ERM ) family , NHERF1 ( NHE regulatory factor 1 , also known as ERM - binding phosphoprotein 50 , EBP50 ) , and NHERF2 ( NHE regulatory factor 2 , also known as NHE3 Kinase A regulatory protein , E3KARP ) , which crosslink actin filaments with plasma membrane proteins . There is a paradox that comes with the cytoskeleton localization of NHE3 : changes in the rates of NHE3 trafficking through regulation of endocytosis and exocytosis lead to changes in the brush border expression and activity of NHE3 . However , NHE3 is firmly fixed to the microvillar actin cytoskeleton . Our laboratory has demonstrated this fixation using advanced imaging with confocal microscopy using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) and GFP C - terminally tagged NHE3 , as well as extracellularly epitope - tagged NHE3 , and we have shown that this is due to binding to two multi - PDZ domain proteins , NHERF1 and NHERF2 . 12 Our laboratory has partially solved this paradox by demonstrating that the NHE3 - cytoskeletal association is dynamic and decreases rapidly but transiently after stimulation of NHE3 endocytosis and exocytosis . With both stimulation and inhibition , the NHE3 association with the multi - PDZ domain protein NHERF2 ( but not NHERF1 ) is dissolved rapidly , only to reform as NHE3 activity returns to baseline . NHERF2 is situated at the base of the 7 intestinal microvilli and at the intermicrovillus cleft area , sites of NHE3 storage and through which NHE3 trafficks , coming and leaving the brush border . NHERF2 appears to be involved in tethering NHE3 to the terminal web region and releasing it in an agonist - specific fashion . 13 A second paradox , however , has also been recognized . Physically , any trafficking to and from the microvilli must go through the thick actin band that makes up the terminal web at the base of the brush border . This is particularly true for the intestine , which has a much thicker terminal web than any other epithelia , presumably to deal with the great deal of stress the epithelium is exposed to during peristalsis . Thus , restructuring actin is exceptionally important here . This actin band is made up largely of the branched Arp2 / 3 complex ( subunits “Actin - Related Protein 2” and “Actin - Related Protein 3” ) . We hypothesize that there must be a method of changing local actin polymerization at the base of the microvilli in order to allow movement through the terminal web as part of altered endocytosis or exocytosis . 1 . 4 Cofilin and Actin Depolymerizing Factor Cofilin / actin depolymerizing factor is a family of ubiquitous actin - binding proteins found in all eukaryotes that function to regulate the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments . This family consists of three highly conserved , similar isoforms that contribute to actin dynamics by different mechanisms . 14 These homologous human genes are cofilin - 1 ( will be referred to as COF in this manuscript ) , cofilin - 2 ( only found in muscle , so not of interest in our intestinal epithelium focus ) , and actin depolymerizing factor ( also known as cofilin - 3 or destrin ; will be referred to as ADF in this manuscript ) . In particular , COF and ADF are qualitatively similar in many respects and seem to play overlapping roles in cells , as the knockdown phenotype of either protein can be rescued by the overexpression of the other , and in some cases they have been shown to heterodimerize . 15 COF is the predominant isoform , being expressed in most mammalian cell types and is the more commonly studied protein in literature . On the other hand , ADF is 8 mainly restricted to epithelial tissues ( e . g . intestine ) and endothelia . 16 COF / ADF are a major component of intranuclear and cytoplasmic actin rods . 17 COF is the most essential in development , as knockout of the COF gene is embryonic lethal in mice , whereas knockout of the ADF gene in mice only causes postnatal blindness due to corneal thickening . 18 Most activities are quite similar between COF and ADF , but in general ADF has not been as extensively studied . COF / ADF proteins primarily function to sever and reorganize actin filaments in the cytoskeleton and associate with G - actin monomers . COF / ADF localize to regions of rapid actin dynamics , severing F - actin from pointed ends ( the – end ) to generate free actin barbed ends ( the + end ) . In terms of differences , COF and ADF differ quantitatively in actin - dynamizing activities : ADF is more efficient at monomer sequestering and actin depolymerizing while COF is more efficient in nucleation and severing . 14 Only ADF is downregulated with an increasing actin monomer pool . It is the dephosphorylated form of COF / ADF that acts in the remodeling of actin . There is a 2 - stage activation of COF / ADF : the release of phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) biphosphate ( also known as PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , or PIP2 ) inhibitory binding and dephosphorylation . COF / ADF are inactivated by phosphorylation at Ser - 3 by LIM kinase and are reactivated by dephosphorylation by Slingshot 1L ( SSH1L ) at the same site . 14 The inactive , phosphorylated form has been found to have another function—activating phospholipase D1 . This generates phosphatidic acid which begins a cascade of signaling events that can lead to microvilli formation and can also lead to phosphorylation ( activation ) of ezrin downstream of a G - protein coupled receptor ( muscarinic cholinergic receptor ) . 19 COF / ADF can be inactivated by binding to PIP2 , remaining in the membrane in its phosphorylated form . 20 COF / ADF becomes active when released from the membrane PIP2 by PLC activity ( for instance as induced rapidly by carbachol ) or by locally increased pH . 9 COF / ADF actin - severing activity is faster at higher ( more alkaline ) pH and is inhibited by pH lower than 7 . 1 , as COF / ADF bind to actin filaments at lower pH ( below 7 . 0 ) and bind preferentially to monomers at higher pH ( above 7 . 5 ) . 21 This relationship between COF / ADF activity and pH is thought to be the direct result of pH effects on PIP2 release ( removing the inhibitory binding ) . In particular , one group found that at higher pH , there is decreased PIP2 binding to COF / ADF . 22 Furthermore , this group has found that H + efflux by NHE1 promotes a COF - dependent increase in actin free barbed ends ( promotion of filament assembly ) in response to migratory cues . This suggests that COF could play a role as a regulator for pH homeostasis . COF / ADF have been found to compete directly with the Arp2 / 3 complex ( a major protein complex for nucleation of actin polymerization and filament branching ) , reducing the affinity of Arp2 / 3 for actin filaments as well as the stability of branches . 23 However , it has also been proposed that the actin filament fragments generated by COF / ADF , specifically at sites of endocytosis , will diffuse through cytoplasm and serve as mother filaments for Arp2 / 3 complex to initiate nucleation for actin polymerization , since Arp2 / 3 must bind to preexisting fragments in order to form new filaments . 24 Thus , though COF / ADF reduce F - actin by severing and depolymerization , the overall effect when combined with Arp2 / 3 could drive an increase in total F - actin . Endocytosis involves the invagination of the plasma membrane which requires actin filament assembly that can be directly induced by Arp2 / 3 . Inhibition of COF / ADF has been found to alter the morphology of actin networks and reduce the rate of actin flux , leading to decreased endocytosis . 24 , 25 COF / ADF and Arp2 / 3 have also been found to work synergistically in cell motility , such as in lamellipodia extension . 26 10 1 . 5 COF / ADF in Trafficking and Cytoskeletal Regulation Since NHE3 is firmly fixed to the cytoskeleton , yet is actively regulated through membrane trafficking and phosphorylation , it is reasonable to consider COF / ADF taking a role in NHE3 regulation . We hypothesize that this occurs via COF / ADF - induced depolymerization of the actin in the terminal web , changing NHE3 association with the cytoskeleton and allowing NHE3 to traffic to and from the intestinal microvillus as part of stimulated endocytosis and exocytosis in the apical membrane . Our preliminary studies have shown that COF complexes with NHE3 , as well as several proteins that are part of the NHE3 - related complexes involved in NHE3 regulation ( unpublished , Figure 3 ) . These proteins , which bind both NHE3 and COF , also include CK2α and NHERF2 . NHE3 and CK2α also bind to PIP2 . 11 Figure 3 : Immunoprecipitation , NHE3 and COF are found to interact . Our lab previously tested whether COF interacts with NHE3 by immunoprecipitation ( IP ) in mice small intestinal total lysate . IgG was used as a negative control and immunoblot / Western was performed . RhoA ( a small GTP - binding protein ) and Rho associated kinase , which regulate actin assembly through phosphorylation of COF / ADF , are found to be required for NHE3 activity . 27 This could suggest that inhibition of COF / ADF by phosphorylation allows for NHE3 activity . However , other studies have found that inactivation of COF / ADF perturbed the sorting of a subset of both soluble and integral membrane proteins at the trans - Golgi network , though it is unknown whether endocytosis or exocytosis was disrupted . 28 There are also examples of membrane proteins or transport activity in literature that have been found to be disrupted by changes in COF / ADF . ClC - 5 ( H + / Cl - exchange transporter 5 ) is a proximal tubule voltage - gated chloride channel with multiple roles in renal tubular albumin uptake . ClC - 5 binds to COF , and phosphorylation ( inhibition ) of COF by overexpressing LIM kinase was found to stabilize the actin cytoskeleton and inhibit albumin uptake . 29 Thus the ClC - 5 binding to COF regulates the level of actin polymerization to allow endosome internalization . GLUT4 ( glucose transporter - 4 ) at the cell surface of muscle and fat tissues takes part in glucose uptake . COF knockdown by siRNA caused overwhelming actin polymerization that inhibited GLUT4 translocation . 30 This suggests that lack of COF can disrupt the exocytosis of membrane proteins . Actin is required for a large number of cellular processes such as cytokinesis , cell shape , migration , endocytosis , and exocytosis . Though the actin cytoskeleton is commonly known to be important to the morphogenesis of polarized epithelial monolayers , the process of actin dynamics and regulation remains unclear . There are many proteins besides COF / ADF related to actin regulation or recruitment for these functions . Some have been studied for involvement in intestinal epithelial cells . 12 Phosphorylated ezrin organizes the apical terminal web and is a key component in elongation of established immature microvilli . Ezrin knockout mice have blunted intestinal villi , short , thick , and non - uniform microvilli , and a disorganized terminal web below the apical surface , as well as elongated apical junctions . 31 Thus , ezrin is essential for the organization of a mature brush border , especially the terminal web region for anchoring the microvilli and forming the apical cell : cell junctions for polarity . NHERF1 knockout mice also had structural defects in microvilli resembling those in ezrin knockout mice . 32 Plastin 1 ( also known as fimbrin ) knockout mice had shorter microvilli and the actin cores seemed to lack rootlets ( the part that extrude into the terminal web ) . 5 Other observations from that research include an altered terminal web and a more fragile brush border ( sensitive to biochemical manipulations , decreased transepithelial resistance ) . Eps8L1a , a member of the Eps8 family of F - actin capping and bundling proteins , appears to work downstream of phosphorylated ezrin to regulate microvillar length , as depletion of Eps8L1a causes the formation of long microvilli , while overexpression causes short immature microvillar development . 33 Myosin Vb knockdown Caco - 2 cells had immature sparse microvilli , reduced apical ezrin , accumulation of subapical F - actin by phalloidin . 34 In comparison , other constitutive microvillar proteins have minimal effects on brush border formation in enterocytes . For example , the brush border structures of enterocytes were not affected in villin - 1 knockout mice , myosin - Ia knockout mice , or espin knockout mice . As we learn more about how intestinal Na + absorption and especially the NHE3 component is regulated , we are gaining more insight into the control of normal digestive physiology and how that becomes abnormal to produce diarrheal diseases . Inhibition of NHE3 regulation leads to inhibition of Na + absorption , resulting in diarrhea and decreased water absorption . If COF / ADF is essential for NHE3 regulation , then we may be able to define new mechanisms by which diarrheal 13 diseases occur , including those induced by specific pathogenic organisms . We also may be able to generate related modifications of NHE3 regulation that may be used in the treatment of diarrheal diseases . 14 Chapter 2 : Methods and Model Development 15 2 . 1 Materials Reagents and antibodies were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) unless otherwise stated : 2’ , 7’ - Bis ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) - 5 ( 6 ) - carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester ( BCECF - AM ) ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) ; Mouse monoclonal anti - hemagglutinin ( HA ) antibodies ( Covance Research Products , Princeton , NJ ) ; Rabbit polyclonal anti - Cofilin antibodies ( Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) ; HOE - 694 was a kind gift from Sonafi - Aventis GAPDH mouse monoclonal antibodies were from U . S . Biological ( Swampscott , MA ) . Alexa 488 mouse monoclonal and Alexa 568 rabbit polyclonal secondary antibodies were from Invitrogen . 2 . 2 Cell Culture For all experiments , the Caco - 2 / BBE ( brush border expressing ) cell line was used , which was obtained from Mark Mooseker ( Yale University , New Haven , CT ) and Jerrold Turner ( University of Chicago , Chicago , IL ) . Caco - 2 cells are a polarized , sodium - absorptive , human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line . Though Caco - 2 cells can be harder to transfect , their phenotype more closely resembles small intestinal epithelial cells , both morphologically and physiologically . They are grown and studied as a confluent monolayer on a cell culture insert filter , such as the Corning Transwell , which allows the cells to differentiate into a polarized epithelium that can be used as an intestinal epithelial transport model system . 35 This model is commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry to study drug absorption in the human small intestine . 16 Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modification of Eagle’s Medium ( DMEM ) with 4 . 5 g / L glucose and L - glutamine without sodium pyruvate ( Corning Cellgro ( Corning , NY ) ) , with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 50 U / ml penicillin and 50 mg / ml streptomycin ( 0 . 5 % ) , pH 7 . 4 , at 37˚C in 5 % CO 2 . To achieve polarity , cells were cultured on collagen - coated semi - permeable membranes ( Corning Transwell , polycarbonate , 0 . 4 um pore size ) for 12 days after becoming confluent . Cells used in transport assays were grown to confluence on small pieces of those Corning polycarbonate membranes glued to plastic coverslips ( called “filter slips” ) . 2 . 3 Adenoviral Infection for NHE3 Expression Caco - 2 cells have low levels of endogenous NHE3 , not enough expression to be accurately gauged by our transport activity studies , so to model the behavior and activity of the NHE3 protein complex , the cells are infected with adenovirus containing HA - NHE3 ( Ad - HA - NHE3 ) . ( Adenoviral HA - NHE3 preparation and purification described in Sarker et al . , 2008 . 12 ) Adenovirus offers 100 % gene delivery efficiency in most cell types and at no risk of integration with host system . Though it gives the highest transgene expression in a very short time , the gene expression level goes down over time . Adenoviral infection typically took place at day 10 after reaching confluence , and the study was performed on day 12 post - confluency , unless otherwise noted . The cells were first exposed to 6 mM EGTA in serum - free medium for 2 h at 37˚C to allow maximum virus exposure to both the apical and basolateral surfaces . Appropriate amounts of viral particles ( 10 9 – 10 10 particles / ml ) in serum - free medium were added to both apical and basal chambers of EGTA - treated cells . After 6 or more hours of infection , cells were rinsed and incubated further in normal growth medium . Adenoviral infection of cells on filter slips occurred 10 days after confluence and transport assays were performed 36 - 48 h later . 17 2 . 4 Lentivirus / short hairpin RNA knockdown ( KD ) of COF and ADF We ordered several constructs of shRNA lentiviral plasmids in the hairpin - pLKO . 1 - puromycin vector for COF and ADF gene silencing , as well as a lentiviral shRNA construct specific for green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) , which is not endogenously expressed in mammalian cells , to be used as a non - targeting negative control to check for off - target effects of shRNA transduction and RNAi activation . These were ordered from the Johns Hopkins High Throughput Biology Center . Table 1 : Each construct will be named by the label in parentheses for this manuscript Knockdown Target Sequence Hairpin Sequence CFL1 ( COF - KD1 ) GCCCTCTATGATGCAACCTAT 5 ' - CCGG - GCCCTCTATGATGCAACCTAT - CTCGAG - ATAGGTTGCATCATAGAGGGC - TTTTT - 3 ' CFL1 ( COF - KD2 ) CAAGCATGAATTGCAAGCAAA 5 ' - CCGG - CAAGCATGAATTGCAAGCAAA - CTCGAG - TTTGCTTGCAATTCATGCTTG - TTTTT - 3 ' CLF1 ( COF - KD3 ) CCAGATAAGGACTGCCGCTAT 5 ' - CCGG - CCAGATAAGGACTGCCGCTAT - CTCGAG - ATAGCGGCAGTCCTTATCTGG - TTTTT - 3 ' DSTN ( ADF - KD1 ) GCGCTATTTCAGGCACATCAT 5 ' - CCGG - GCGCTATTTCAGGCACATCAT - CTCGAG - ATGATGTGCCTGAAATAGCGC - TTTTTG - 3 ' DSTN ( ADF - KD2 ) GATCTCAATCGGGCTTGTATT 5 ' - CCGG - GATCTCAATCGGGCTTGTATT - CTCGAG - AATACAAGCCCGATTGAGATC - TTTTTG - 3 ' Plasmids for each construct were prepared using an EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit ( Qiagen ) . To produce the lentivirus , a packaging plasmid , an envelope - encoding plasmid , and a shRNA - coding plasmid were co - transfected into human embryonic kidney 293A cells in Opti - MEM serum - free medium using Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer’s protocol ( Invitrogen ) . After incubation with medium containing sodium butyrate , the supernatant containing lentivirus was collected on the first two days after transfection and syringe filtered to be used immediately or stored at - 80ᵒ C . Next , we used ViraDuctin™ Lentivirus Transduction Kit ( Cell Biolabs ) , following the manufacturer’s protocol to improve the efficiency of the lentiviral infection in wild - type Caco - 2 cells in six - well plates . Using cells that were not fully confluent ( ~ 50 % ) also improved the infection efficiency from < 30 % to > 70 % as tested with a GFP lentivirus . After 24 hours of infection , we replaced the mixture with medium containing puromycin at 10 μg / mL , increasing 18 the concentration to 20  g / mL after another two days to add selective pressure for the knockdowns . In addition to each of the individual KD constructs , we also experimented with combinations , using equal fractions of each lentivirus for each infection . Table 2 : Combination knockdowns using equal fractions of Table 1 constructs Knockdown Combination Name Combination “C1C2” COF - KD1 + COF - KD2 “C1C2A2” COF - KD1 + COF - KD2 + ADF - KD2 “C2A2” COF - KD2 + ADF - KD2 2 . 5 Immunoblotting The knockdowns were verified by performing Western blot analysis on the total protein lysates of the GFP - KD , COF - KD , and ADF - KD cells , using GAPDH as a loading control and specific antibodies against COF and ADF . Caco - 2 / BBE cells grown for 12 days post - confluency were serum starved for 4 hours and washed three times with cold PBS . Cells were scraped in PBS and collected in 1 . 5 - ml Eppendorf tubes . Cells were mixed with lysis buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM NaF , and 1 % Triton X - 100 ) containing protease inhibitors and homogenized by sonication . After removal of insoluble cell debris by low - speed centrifugation ( 2 , 000 g x 10 min ) , the protein concentration was measured with the bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) method ( Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) ) or the Bradford assay ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ( Hercules , CA ) ) . Calculated amounts of total cell lysates were mixed with loading buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl pH 6 . 8 , 1 % SDS , 10 % glycerol and 1 % 2 - mercaptoethanol ) , boiled for 10 min . Equal volume and concentration were loaded in each lane ( 20 - 30 μg ) . Proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE ( 12 % gel ) , transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by electrophoresis , and after blocking for 1 hour in 1 % BSA , blotted with primary antibodies to COF ( 1 : 2000 ) , ADF ( 1 : 1000 ) , GAPDH ( 1 : 5000 ) , B - Actin ( 1 : 5000 ) , ArpC2 ( 1 : 1000 ) , Villin ( 1 : 1000 ) . Fluorescently labeled IR - Dyes 800 and 680 19 conjugated with rabbit polyclonal or mouse monoclonal antibodies ( LI - COR ) were used as secondary antibodies ( 1 : 10 , 000 ) . Protein bands were visualized and quantified with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System and LI - COR software for the IR - Dye secondary antibodies . 2 . 6 Immunostaining / Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy The structure of the KD cells was observed with immunostaining and confocal microscopy . The cells were plated at 1x10 6 cells / mL in 1 . 12 cm 2 Transwells ( filters ) , essentially at a level of confluency . They were left to grow for 12 days post - confluency , with a media change every other day . The filters were washed with PBS at 4° C , then fixed in a 3 % paraformaldehyde solution for 30 minutes . The cells were blocked and permeabilized with 1 % BSA + 0 . 1 % saponin for 1 hour . Antibodies and markers used at 4° C included a Phalloidin - 647 conjugated antibody ( Life Technologies ) , Wheat Germ Agglutinin - 488 conjugated ( Life Technologies ) , Hoechst DNA counterstaining dye , and polyclonal COF ( Abcam ) and ADF ( Sigma ) primary antibodies with R - 633 secondary antibody for fluorescent labeling . Primary antibodies in 1 % BSA were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4° C , and after rinsing in 0 . 1 % BSA in PBS ( three times for 5 min each ) , incubated with secondary antibodies in 1 % BSA for 40 minutes . Membrane inserts were detached from wells , placed on glass microscope slides , mounted with Fluorogel ( Invitrogen ) , and examined with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope . Images were acquired using a 40x ( 1 . 3 NA ) oil objective . 2 . 7 Transmission Electron Microscopy The structure of the brush border was further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy ; the processing was performed by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Microscope Facility . Images were taken at 20 , 000x or 25 , 000x magnification . The number and length of microvilli in each image was averaged . The lengths of individual microvilli were 20 measured from images of randomly chosen cells using a ruler set perpendicular to the base of the microvilli . At least two microvilli were measured per cell . Polycarbonate - filter - grown cells were processed for conventional electron microscopy analysis at 12 days post - confluence . After several rinses in warm ( 37° C ) PBS , cells were fixed at room temperature for 1 h in 1 . 6 % PFA , 2 . 5 % gluteraldehyde , 3 % sucrose and 0 . 1 M CaCo buffer pH 7 . 4 . Cells were rinsed once in 0 . 1 M cacodylate plus 3 % sucrose , and stored overnight at 4˚C . After rinsing in the same solution , cells were incubated for 1 h on ice in reduced osmium ( 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer with 0 . 4 % postassium ferrocyanide and 1 % OsO 4 ) , rinsed quickly at room temperature in double - distilled water , incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 2 % uranyl acetate in double - distilled water , and dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol to 100 % . Samples were incubated overnight in 1 : 1 EPON : ethanol at 4˚C , warmed to room temperature , transferred for 1 h into 100 % EPON plus DMP30 , then left overnight in fresh EPON + catalyst with gentle shaking . The next day , fresh EPON + catalyst was added at 2 - h intervals and incubated in a vacuum chamber for another 2 h . Filters were cut out of the holders , further cut into small pieces ( ~ 2x2 mm ) , embedded in EPON and cured for 2 – 3 days at 65˚C . Sections were cut on a Riechert Ultracut E with a Diatome Diamond knife , collected on formvar - coated 1x2 mm copper slot grids , and then stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate . Grids were viewed on a Hitachi 7600 TEM operating at 80 kV and digital images of the apical regions of control and KD cells were captured with an AMT 1Kx1K CCD camera . 2 . 8 Measurement of Na + / H + Exchange Activity Cellular Na + / H + exchange activity in cells expressing HA - NHE3 was determined fluorometrically under basal and inhibited ( forskolin ( FSK ) , 25  M ) conditions using the intracellular pH - sensitive dye BCECF - AM ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) . To measure the Na + / H + exchange activity in Caco - 2 / BBE cells , the cells were grown as polarized monolayers on 21 pieces of polycarbonate membranes ( 0 . 4 - um pore size ) attached over an aperture in rectangular plastic coverslips ( “filter slip” ) . They were infected with adenovirus HA - NHE3 at day 10 after reaching confluence and were then serum - starved 48 h later for at least 4 h before Na + / H + exchange activity ( NHE3 ) was determined . HOE - 694 ( 50  M ) was used to inhibit the contributions of NHE1 , NHE2 and NHE8 . Cells were loaded for 1 h at 37˚C with 10  M BCECF - AM in Na + / NH 4 Cl solution ( 98 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgSO 4 , 1 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 25 mM glucose , 20 mM HEPES , and 40 mM NH 4 Cl , pH 7 . 4 ) . During this dye loading and NH 4 Cl prepulse step , cells were treated with 25  M FSK for 30 min , or a volume control was added . The filters were mounted in a cuvette , placed in a fluorometer ( Photon Technology International , Lawrenceville , NJ ) , and perfused from both apical and basal sides with TMA + medium to rapidly acidify the intracellular space . After 2 - 3 min to reach a stable baseline , the apical TMA + medium was replaced with Na + medium containing 138 mM NaCl and no TMA . The basal side continued TMA + medium perfusion . To standardize the pH i to the fluorescence emission , the K + / nigericin method was used . The emissions recorded are normalized to the surface area for each sample . The values were analyzed using nonlinear curve fitting with a Boltzmann function as used in the Origin program to produce a sigmoidal curve . 𝑦 = 𝐴 1 − 𝐴 2 1 + e ( x−x 0 ) / 𝑑𝑥 + 𝐴 2 Initial rates of Na + - dependent intracellular alkalinization ( H + efflux , in micromolar per second ) were calculated for a given pH i over the first 1 min and expressed as  pH /  t . Data from each coverslip were calculated and analyzed . For each independent experiment , results from all coverslips for each condition were analyzed together and represent an N = 1 . Statistical comparison was performed by paired Student’s t - tests . 22 Chapter 3 : Results 23 3 . 1 Knockdown Characterization by Western Blot and Immunofluorescence In total , 9 different cell lines of various knockdowns were produced , as listed in Table 1 and Table 2 ( GFP - KD control , COF - KD1 , COF - KD2 , COF - KD3 , ADF - KD1 , ADF - KD2 , C1C2 , C2A2 , and C1C2A2 ) . Furthermore , samples of mouse ileum and jejunum were used to give insight into tissue level expression of COF and ADF . COF - KD1 were the most difficult cells to grow up , being very slow dividing and having low cell viability . ADF - KD1 was the second slowest growing cell line . C1C2A2 was the next slowest , then C1C2 , then C2A2 . On the other hand , COF - KD2 and ADF - KD2 grew very well ; resembling growth of control GFP - KD cells , if not more rapid growth . COF - KD3 was grown in a separate batch of experiments , so could not be qualitatively compared in terms of cell growth , but it did not appear to have much deficit in cell expansion . In general , later passages tended to lose knockdown effects , so all following experiments used Passage 5 or earlier from frozen stock . As described in Chapter 2 , various antibodies were used to quantitatively analyze the amount of different proteins of interest in the protein lysates from the 9 different cell lines . GAPDH was used as a loading control for the analysis ( performed with the Image Studio software ) .

The quantifications in Figure 4B / 4C are done using the actual fluorescence intensity of the GAPDH signal to normalize each COF and ADF signal . However , for a qualitative overview of Figure 4A , we can assume the GAPDH levels are equivalent in all 11 samples and can look directly at the intensity of the bands for COF and ADF . When observing Figure 4A by eye , we can already see a marked decrease of COF in COF - KD1 , ADF - KD1 , C1C2 , and C1C2A2 , as well as a lesser decrease in COF - KD2 , COF - KD3 , and C2A2 , from COF expression in GFP - KD . For ADF , the greatest knockdown is in ADF - KD2 , ADF - KD1 , C1C2A2 , and C2A2 , as well as some knockdown in COF - KD1 , COF - KD2 , and COF - KD3 . The mouse tissue samples from ileum and jejunum had enormous quantities of ADF , but generally less COF . Quantifications were done by normalizing to GAPDH , then calculating the percent change compared to normalized ADF or COF in GFP - KD . After averaging results over all experiments , the highest to lowest knockdowns in terms of average percentage are as follows : For COF , the greatest is C1C2A2 ( 79 . 33 % ) , followed by C1C2 ( 75 % ) , ADF - KD1 ( 63 . 5 % ) , COF - KD2 ( 57 . 4 % ) , COF - KD1 ( 55 . 4 % ) , C2A2 ( 52 % ) , COF - KD3 ( 42 . 3 % ) , then ADF - KD2 ( 19 . 3 % ) . For ADF , the greatest is ADF - KD2 ( 72 . 7 % ) , ADF - KD1 ( 63 % ) , C1C2A2 ( 58 . 7 % ) , C2A2 ( 52 . 4 % ) , then C1C2 ( 21 . 7 % ) and COF - KD1 ( 19 . 2 % ) . Some constructs actually averaged an increase in ADF : COF - KD2 ( - 12 . 8 % knockdown ) and COF - KD3 ( - 43 . 7 % knockdown ) . For each of the average percent knockdowns , we performed a one sample t - test ( null hypothesis that the percent knockdown has a mean value of 0 , corresponding to no change from control GFP - KD ) . The Western results suggested that with p < 0 . 01 , COF - KD1 , COF - KD2 , ADF - KD1 , and C1C2 decreased COF expression compared to that in GFP - KD , while ADF - KD2 and C2A2 did not have a significant effect on COF expression . Also with p < 0 . 01 , ADF - KD1 , ADF - 26 KD2 , and C2A2 decreased ADF expression compared to that in GFP - KD , while COF - KD1 , COF - KD2 , COF - KD3 , and C1C2 did not have an effect on ADF expression . Table 4 : Knockdown constructs resulting effects on COF / ADF expression COF - KD1 : good knockdown of COF likely no effect on ADF COF - KD2 : good knockdown of COF likely no effect on ADF COF - KD3 : okay knockdown of COF likely no effect on ADF ADF - KD1 : good knockdown of COF good knockdown of ADF ADF - KD2 : likely no effect on COF good knockdown of ADF C1C2 : good knockdown of COF likely no effect on ADF C2A2 : likely no effect on COF good knockdown of ADF C1C2A2 : okay knockdown of COF okay knockdown of ADF Interestingly , ADF - KD1 appeared to knockdown COF more strongly than the COF - KD constructs , while also knocking down ADF . However , ADF - KD1 grew too slowly in culture to be used reliably in experiments . For a good knockdown of COF alone , COF - KD1 , COF - KD2 , and C1C2 were the options . COF - KD1 grew too slowly in culture to be used reliably in experiments . C1C2 was also a slower growing cell line . Thus , COF - KD2 was chosen as the optimal construct for testing ( 57 % knockdown of COF ) . For a good knockdown of ADF alone , ADF - KD2 and C2A2 were the options . ADF - KD2 was faster growing and had less ADF ( 73 % knockdown of ADF ) , so it was chosen as the optimal construct for testing , over C2A2 . Quantitatively , the COF - KD2 cells significantly knocked - down COF but did not significantly change ADF expression . The ADF - KD2 cells significantly decreased ADF and there was no significant change in COF . 27 COF - KD2 and ADF - KD2 were the two cell types chosen for transmission electron microscopy and functional studies of NHE3 .

These were the optimized constructs chosen for COF and ADF KD in the following experiments . We proceeded to grow , fix , and stain COF - KD2 and ADF - KD2 cells for immunostaining using COF / ADF antibodies , phalloidin , wheat germ agglutinin , and Hoechst stains . 28 A B 29 Figure 6 : ADF - KD have increased and COF - KD decreased microvillar clusters .

Scale bar : 20 μm Phalloidin ( Phal , green left ) binds to filamentous actin , which helps distinguish the brush border ( microvilli cores plus terminal web region ) as well as other areas of F - actin accumulation . Wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA , green right ) selectively binds to sialic acid residues , which is observed in the apical membrane , showing brush border in the xz plane . COF - KD2 cells have less apical brush border ( the punctae are less dense ) than the GFP - KD cells , as seen in the cells labeled with the . The GFP - KD cells might have thicker clusters of microvilli that create the apical surface labeling , but the COF - KD2 cells have less apical phalloidin and WGA staining , though lateral phalloidin remains intact . Cofilin ( red ) is normally prevalent in the sub - apical domain and cytoplasm , forming small rod - like shapes ( arrow , ) between the lateral membrane and the nucleus ( blue ) . In COF - KD2 the red staining is reduced , showing the KD , but the distribution is not altered . ADF - KD2 cells have denser clusters of microvilli as indicated by the apical brush border phalloidin and WGA staining , indicated by . Lateral phalloidin might even be slightly thicker in the ADF - KD2 cells . Furthermore in the xz cross - sectional view , the ADF - KD2 brush border appears more prominent and uniform than that of GFP - KD . ADF ( red ) is normally diffusely sub - apical and adjacent to the lateral membrane ( arrow , ) , almost co - localizing with the sub - apical phalloidin staining . However , in addition to having decreased ADF overall , ADF - KD2 loses its lateral membrane expression towards the middle of the cell and inferiorly , becoming very diffuse throughout the cytoplasm . 30 3 . 2 Transmission Electron Microscopy To better observe the differences in microvilli , transmission electron microscopy was performed twice . Transmission electron microscopy of the three cell lines showed that microvilli of COF - KD2 cells were shorter and fewer in number than those of GFP - KD ( control ) cells . ADF - KD2 cells , conversely , had longer microvilli and a greater number per image , as well as straighter ( microvilli were perpendicular to the cell surface ) . The width of the microvilli did not change much in any of the three cell types . It was difficult to distinguish rootlets and the terminal web region . The COF - KD2 cells have many lobular shapes coming off from the cell surface . These could be cross sectional views of bent microvilli , or stumps of microvilli remaining from microvilli that have broken off . The latter would suggest that the defect in COF expression leads to more fragile microvilli that are more likely to break off during the TEM processing steps .

( C ) Average length of microvilli , measured from root . p < 0 . 01 : * * , NS : not significant . Error bars represent standard error . n = # of images . For each image , the total number of microvilli and the length of several representative microvilli were measured . These numbers were averaged and resulting data shown in Figure 8B / 8C . A two sample t - test was performed between the GFP - KD / COF - KD and GFP - KD / ADF - KD , and both comparisons showed that the lengths and number were different with p < 0 . 01 . 3 . 3 NHE3 Functional Studies We studied the basal NHE3 activity rates of GFP - KD , COF2 - KD , and ADF - KD2 cells . We also tested the effects of forskolin , which stimulates NHE3 endocytosis by elevating cAMP . Each experiment consisted of several traces for each condition ( more than 3 ) . The results were averaged for each condition , and this value was reported as a single experiment , n = 1 . Each experiment was performed at least 3 times ( except for one experiment with forskolin exposure where n = 2 , studies ongoing ) , and those numbers were averaged and analyzed for statistical significance using two sample t - tests . FSK treatment resulted in a significant change from basal for all three cell types ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Between the GFP - KD / COF - KD and GFP - KD / ADF - KD , both comparisons indicated changes in basal NHE3 activity ( p < 0 . 10 ) . As shown in Figure 10 , COF - KD2 cells had decreased basal activity rates ( ~ 37 % decrease ) compared to GFP - KD ( control ) cells . ADF - KD2 cells had increased ( ~ 70 % increase ) basal rates of NHE3 activity compared to GFP - KD ( control ) cells . Forskolin ( FSK ) had a similar inhibitory effect on GFP - KD ( ~ 31 % ) , COF - KD2 ( ~ 23 % ) , and ADF - KD2 cells ( ~ 63 % ) . It could be possible that FSK had a greater inhibitory effect on ADF - KD2 cells ( and possibly a lesser effect on COF - KD2 cells ) , but more experiments would need to be performed to confirm this observation . 33 Figure 9 : Sample traces for measuring NHE3 activity . Arrow points to the start of sodium perfusion . Slopes roughly correspond to NHE3 activity , though the resulting fluorescence intensities would be normalized using the K + - Clamp / Nigericin pH standards of 6 . 0 , 6 . 6 , and 7 . 3 . 34 Figure 10 : Average basal NHE3 activity is increased in ADF - KD2 cells and decreased in COF - KD2 cells . FSK had a significant inhibitory effect in all three cell lines . 35 Chapter 4 : Discussion / Conclusions 36 For the knockdown cell lines that we chose to study ( GFP - KD , COF - KD2 , ADF - KD2 ) , we found that COF is necessary for intestinal microvillar formation or maintenance , while ADF normally functions in a way that limits apical microvillar number and size . These conclusions can be made directly from the transmission electron microscopy results , since decreasing COF resulted in cells with fewer , shorter , and oddly angled microvilli , and in contrast , depleting ADF improved those microvillar characteristics compared to wild - type . The gene knockdowns were incorporated into Caco - 2 cells via lentivirus delivery which tends to have lower efficiency compared to adenovirus and slow expression but is a persistent and stable transfection . Risks include integration into host genome leading to mutations of genes or random activation of oncogenes in the host system . When culturing the various knockdown cell lines in Table 3 , we noticed that several cell lines had very slow growth compared to control . Since COF plays such a vital function in actin related processes in all cell types , it makes sense that some knockdowns of COF may be more harmful to cell survival than others . For example , defects in cytokinesis could explain the stunted cell division we saw during culturing the other constructs of COF - KD . It also fits that we would see the most definite morphological change in the microvilli of the COF - KD cell line , again knowing that for normal cell function , COF plays some role in regulation and sorting of various proteins through cytoskeletal changes . The localization of COF also suggested a major role in essential cell processes , as COF formed rod - like structures throughout the cytoplasm around the nucleus . However , in the immunofluorescence results , we did not see a dramatic change in the phalloidin distribution , which we would expect in cell undergoing cytoskeletal changes . Furthermore , we did not see COF and phalloidin co - localizing , which we would expect , since COF needs to bind to F - actin to depolymerize it . However , it has been reported that COF and phalloidin compete for the same binding site on F - actin , which could explain the lack of co - localization . 17 , 36 However , this is still 37 ambiguous as there has also been literature reporting co - localization of COF and phalloidin . 37 For future studies , it would be interesting to use various other antibodies for actin filaments and actin monomers , and possibly other important actin related proteins as well . During the Western blot analyses , keeping in mind the goal of influencing NHE3 transport with a COF / ADF knockdown , other antibodies such as those for 𝛽 - actin , Arp2 / 3 , and villin were used , but no dramatic change in protein levels occurred in the preliminary experiments or outside / unexpected error occurred that led the data to be inconclusive . It is rather unexpected that we did not see a difference in actin and Arp2 / 3 levels , so it might be due to the antibodies : to quantify actin by Western blot , an antibody against all actin isoforms may be better than a 𝛽 - actin specific antibody , which is usually optimized for use as a loading control . The antibodies for Arp2 / 3 also come in multiple isoforms . These have yet to be optimized for our experiments . Furthermore , studying relative amounts of phosphorylated COF and ADF could be interesting for understanding regulation of active COF / ADF after knockdown has occurred . Changes in phosphorylation could lead to confounding side effects such as recovery of defects that would have stemmed from the knockdown . For ADF - KD , we might expect a specialized role for ADF over the COF isoform due to its prominent expression in intestine , such as we saw in the Western blots of mouse tissue ( ileum and jejunum ) . The distribution of ADF was also very different from that of COF . If we could make guesses as to specific function based on localization , ADF seemed more concentrated subapically and laterally . This could suggest a role in actin processes related to the formation of cell : cell junctions , plasma membrane support , and perhaps the terminal web region . However , it is hard to distinguish the terminal web region in the confocal images . In immunofluorescence images , neither COF nor ADF are localized in the microvillar region of the cells . This suggests that COF / ADF do not play a direct role in the formation of the actin cores of microvilli . However , knocking down COF and ADF did result in structural changes 38 of the microvilli which indicates an indirect relationship between COF / ADF and microvillar formation . Lastly , the subapical localization of COF / ADF might be specific of intestinal epithelial cells for their polarized structure , especially the terminal web region , but to confirm this , antibodies specific to the terminal web region could be investigated for co - localization with COF / ADF . Furthermore , after knockdown , the only observable change was a general reduction in intensity of COF / ADF ; there was no shift in localization . In literature , most wild - type Caco - 2 cells have a uniform , full brush border , with all the microvilli perfectly perpendicular to the cell surface and at almost the same height . However , the GFP - KD control cells unfortunately did not appear to be the best example of a typical Caco - 2 cell brush border ( looking slightly damaged instead ) , suggesting that the lentivirus selective pressure may have led to an unwanted effect on microvillar formation . Thus , if we err on the side of caution and compare our COF - KD2 and ADF - KD2 micrographs to those of Caco - 2 wild - type cells in literature , we could remark that COF - KD2 has the significant effect of stunted microvilli whereas ADF - KD2 might look roughly normal . In general , the COF - KD2 cells phenotype as observed through transmission electron microscopy were similar to that of intestinal epithelial cells in ezrin knockout mice , NHERF1 knockout mice , and plastin knockout mice . The elongated microvillar phenotype of ADF - KD2 cells was similar to that of Eps8L1a knockdown . 33 These similar structural changes would suggest similar mechanisms of action on actin by these respective proteins . In literature , ADF is recruited to the apical domain of cells during ischemia ( microvillar destruction ) . 38 This could suggest that ADF plays a role in being recruited to compensate for the loss of microvilli , or that ADF is involved in the action of destruction of microvilli , but we would lean toward the latter , as this matches our finding that ADF normally plays a role in reducing microvillar length and density . In literature , since ADF is most strongly expressed in epithelial 39 cells and neurons , it fits that ADF might have an extra function that is only needed in certain polarized cell types . Hemorrhagic shock in intestine ( tight junctional barrier loss ) induces activated ADF / COF leading to loss of F - actin and tight junction loss . Thus , ADF / COF signaling in tight junctions are important , which fits our data showing accumulation of ADF / COF around the region where tight junctions are formed . 39 In terms of the functional changes in NHE3 resulting from COF and ADF inhibition , we had expected to see decreased endocytosis resulting in increased NHE3 activity . This is postulated to be a result of lack of actin severing around the apical area , limiting the formation of membrane invaginations for endocytosis . Specifically , the finding in literature that decreasing actin flux by COF inhibition results in decreased endocytic internalization at the plasma membrane leads us to predict that there will be more NHE3 trapped at the surface when COF is disrupted . 24 We did indeed see increased NHE3 activity in the ADF - KD cells , but the COF - KD cells had the opposite effect , resulting in decreased NHE3 activity . Other literature might fit our COF - KD finding , such as the fact that COF inhibition decreases trafficking of other transport proteins . Inhibition of COF also disrupts protein sorting , which could lead to our observation of less NHE3 activity ( if the exocytosis is affected ) . If ADF plays a direct role in NHE3 regulation ( beyond structural changes such as increasing surface area ) , ADF normally limits basal NHE3 activity , since depleting ADF increased activity . ADF is not involved in cAMP induced inhibition of NHE3 , as we saw through our FSK experiments . COF , on the other hand , might normally increase basal NHE3 activity , but we found is also not involved in cAMP induced inhibition of NHE3 . The fact that the FSK effect was normal in both knockdowns suggests that endocytosis occurs normally even when COF or ADF are decreased . This would mean that even though other studies have found that COF is important for some types of endocytosis , it is not necessary for all endocytosis to occur . However , 40 ADF - KD and COF - KD had opposite effects in basal NHE3 activity . Thus we would hypothesize that a change in exocytosis is causing these differences . These changes in NHE3 activity are interesting in regards to pH regulation , since in literature , COF / ADF become more active at alkaline pH ( such as resulting from increased NHE3 activity ) , leading to more barbed ends and filament assembly by Arp2 / 3 . 22 Thus , observing higher NHE3 activity in the ADF - KD cells could suggest that the cells are trying to compensate for the lack of ADF and are driving NHE3 activity to increase active ADF / COF . On the other hand , observing lower NHE3 activity in the COF - KD cells would go completely against this compensation idea , where if anything , there would be even less COF / ADF activity as a result of the lower pH . To fit both of these ideas , perhaps more active ADF / COF driving actin dynamics ( both severing and assembly ) leads to increased trafficking of NHE3 in general , specifically to bring NHE3 to the surface of the cells or lack of ability to bring NHE3 to the surface of the cells ( blockage by uncoordinated actin dynamics ) . For ADF - KD cells , one might suspect that the increase in microvilli leads to an increased surface area , allowing for the increase in transport activity . However , the fluorometric method we use for measuring NHE3 activity normalizes for surface area , allowing us to take the exchange rates at face value . Understanding the regulation of NHE3 is important for understanding diseases such as diarrhea , as well as the possibility of better treatments for diarrhea . In terms of COF / ADF , the finding that ADF - KD cells have increased microvillar length and density and the increase in NHE3 activity suggest that inhibition of ADF could lead to stimulation of absorption and NHE3 activity that could compensate for the inhibition of NHE3 seen in diarrhea . The COF - KD cells having damaged microvilli suggests an important role of COF in brush border structure and having NHE3 activity , so making sure there is no inactivation of COF could also be a treatment method for diseases like diarrhea . 41 Chapter 5 : Future Directions 42 As noted in our discussion , a different control might be useful to make sure our observations were not a result of a faulty control cell line since our GFP - KD did not appear to have exactly a normal phenotype . Other possibilities are using an empty lentiviral vector or a scrambled shRNA . It would be good to also repeat the experiments we have done with a second construct of COF knockdown alone ( such as the C1C2 cell line we created ) and a second construct of ADF knockdown alone ( such as the C2A2 , or perhaps finding a better construct since we suspect that C2A2 only has the ADF - KD2 shRNA effect and no additive ADF knockdown effect from the COF - KD2 shRNA . ) Other cell lines that would be important to test include knocking down both COF and ADF simultaneously , which should prevent any recovery effects between the two isoforms . The cell lines we produced earlier could be used for these studies , but would require a much longer growth period ( likely more than 12 days ) . It would also be informative to check a double knockdown of both COF and ADF . One cell line we already made , ADF - KD1 , could be used for this purpose , but it had some defects in cell growth ( likely in cell division ) . Studies could also be performed using the ADF knockout mouse model , to analyze the intestinal tissue for changes in comparison to wild - type mice . It would be better to confirm the knockdown effects by running knock - in or rescue experiments for COF and ADF . Other methods of stimulating or inhibiting actin polymerization could also be used for this purpose , such as jasplakinolide , cytochalasin D , and latrunculin A studies , which enhance F - actin depolymerization , inhibit actin polymerization , or induce actin polymerization , respectively . 24 , 40 Lastly , inducing phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of COF / ADF by changing LIM kinase or Slingshot phosphatase could also be used as tools to study inhibition or stimulation of COF / ADF . To confirm if there is an increase of NHE3 in ADF - KD2 and a decrease of NHE3 in COF - KD2 corresponding to the activity increases / decreases that we observed , performing cell 43 surface biotinylation to quantify the NHE3 protein expression at the surface would be useful . We also would like to perform further confocal analysis to visualize NHE3 co - localizing with cell surface markers and COF / ADF . It would be particularly interesting to see if there is subapical co - localization , which could suggest the terminal web region being of interest , though it is challenging to resolve when the confocal takes sections approximately every 0 . 5  m ( microvilli average only around 1  m in length , and the terminal web is a much thinner region underneath the microvilli ) . To further ascertain any changes in regulation of NHE3 activity , other inhibitory treatments could be studied for response in the knockdown cell lines , such as carbachol or disease conditions that lead to decreased NHE3 expression . Furthermore , studying methods of stimulation and exocytosis would be very important , as we already have reason to believe that it is exocytosis and not endocytosis that is affected to result in changes in NHE3 activity . In addition to transport studies , changes in NHE3 localization under various conditions could possibly be observed through confocal microscopy as well . 44 References 1 Donowitz M , Mohan S , Zhu CX , et al .
