TOPOROV Department of Surface Phenomena , Institute of Physical Chemistry , Academy of Sciences , Moscow , U . S . S . R . Received October 10 , 1974 ; accepted April 30 , 1975 A strict theory of reciprocal influence of the contact deformation and molecular attraction of a ball and a plane has been developed . It has been shown that despite the van der Waals ' forces being capable of increasing the elastic contact area between the ball and the plane , the force that is required to overcome the molecular forces arising when the contact is broken does not increase thereby . In fact , it remains equal to the attraction force value that is deter - mined when considering the point contact of a nondeformed ball with a plane . In the absence of the electrostatic component , the adhesion force is equivalent to the first power of the ball radius and to the amount of work per unit area as required for effecting the equilibrium tearing - off of a flat surface of the same nature . Determination of the force of adhesion of small particles to one another or to a solid surface is essential to solving many applied and scientific problems . However , most calcu - lations of the adhesion force of small particles carried out up to now ( 1 ) do not take into a6hbunt the effect of contact deformation that inevitably arises upon contact of particles with a solid surface . As long ago as 1934 , one of the authors of the present paper was first to pose a problem on the effect of contact deformations on the adhesion of particles and vice versa ( 3 ) . At that time an approach also was suggested to solving this problem by using the virtual displacement ( thermodynamic ) method taking into account the adhesion energy in combina - tion with the Hertz theory . This enabled one to calculate the surplus contact deformation due to the adhesion energy and to assume that the contact deformations do not increase the adhesion force that is needed to interrupt the contact . But this assumption could not unambigu - ously substantiated because we disregarded the energy of the noncontact adhesion forces acting within the ring - shaped zone surrounding the contact area . The same thermodynamic method referred to as an approximate theory was used in a recent paper ( 2 ) the authors probably were unaware of the earlier work ( 3 ) - . The object of the present work is to clarify this matter . For this purpose , the calculation takes into account the energy of molecular attraction in the ring - shaped zone of non - contact adhesion . Recently , an attempt has been made ( 4 ) to take into account the effect of contact de - formation on the adhesion force . However , in that work the contact deformations were accounted for incorrectly , leading to an erroneous conclusion that taking into account the contact deformation on the basis of Hertz ' s theory should have resulted not only in an increase in the adhesion force of particles , but also in a variation ( or modification ) of the type of its dependence on the size of particles . Now , Ref . ( 3 ) allows us to draw the opposite conclusion . The earlier paper ( 3 ) considered the general case of a contact between an 3 , convex surfaces , 131 132 B . V . Derjaguin which resulted in deriving rather cumbersome formulas . In view of this , now we shall limit ourselves to the simplest case of contact between a spherical particle of radius R and a plane solid surface . The more general case of two spheres of radii Rl , R2 may be included in our analysis by replacing R by R1R2 / ( RI + R2 ) . For this purpose , let us first of all establish how the shape of the surface of a spherical particle near the contact area will be changed under the effect of contact deformations ; that is , let us define the law of variation of distance between the opposite points of a sphere and a plane , depending upon their remoteness from the contact area . I . DETERMINATION OF THE SHAPE OF THE SURFACE OF AN ELASTIC SPHERICAL PARTICLE NEAR TO THE ZONE OF ITS CONTACT WITH A FLAT RIGID SURFACE Let us consider the case of elastic interaction of an elastic ball with an absolute hard surface , that is , the case where EI , all / Esurf < < l . Yet the modulus of elasticity of the ball should not be too small , so that the molecular attrac - tion forces would not be able to change the ball form appreciably outside the contact area , as compared with that defined by the Hertz . Ref . ( 2 ) considered the opposite case of a very small value of the elastic modulus . The authors , however , motivated their limiting to that case only by ' practical considerations , without referring to other reasons . These considerations ( e . g . , the difficulty of elimin - ating the influence of substrates roughness or of dust particles ) prove to be unconvincing when there is a contact between very smooth particles of small radius , for which the present analysis is exactly intended . Note that in the case of a very high elastic modulus the form of a gap between the surfaces has nothing in common with that considered in ( 2 ) . Let us also point out that in that case ( 2 ) the de - formation field close to the boundaries of the contact area will exhibit the continuity breakups , which is likely to interfere with the making of a strict calculation even to the first approximation . Nonetheless , the calculations and their comparison with the experiment , as given by the authors ( 2 ) , present a great interest . In accordance with the Hertz theory ( S ) , the distribution of the normal pressure all over the contact area , which is circular in the case under consideration , with normal load F applied thereto , will be described by / ' , ( p ) . . . . . t - EI ~ 27ra ' a a21 where p is a distance from the center of a contact circle to the point considered , a is the radius of the contact circle ( see Fig . 1 ) , and a is the shift of the center of the bail having radius R toward the plane under lhe effect of force F . The normally applied , concentrated load l ~ , dw results in setting up a deformation of the ball surface whose normal component is equal to ( 6 ) , / o , ( R ' ) . . . . . . < 2 ~ ~ ' E R ' where R ' is the distance flom the load appli - cation point to the point al which lhe de - 771t llll / / / l / ~ / / l l l / ~ , / / 1 / / lYl / J / / / ~ / / I I I t I 1 I I I ~ - . 1 I I / 1 \ 1 ' , v FIG . 1 .

It is quite natural that in the case considered , the total normal deformation may be found from expression 2 by substituting P . from formula 1 therein , and by integrating with respect to the entire contact area . Now , if we take a point found at the surface of a ball having coordinates r , z , then the normal component of deformation will be w ( R ' ) = - - Here 1 - - a s f ~ f2 , p , ( p ) I I - - = 7 - , pdpd ~ . 3 rE JoJo R R ' = 0 " - - p ) = + z2 = r ~ - 2rpcos ~ , + p ~ + zt 4 Let us show first of all that when calculating the deformation of points found at the surface of a ball near to the perimeter of the contact area , in all cases the value of z - ~ may be neg - lected in expression 4 . As will become apparent from Fig . 1 , the relative influence of z on the value of p increases with the distance from the pressure area , for that influence is proportional to cos 3 < Yet at r > > a R ' = ( r 2 + z ' ~ ) L As at a nondeformed surface ( with r > > a ) z = r ~ ' / 2R while the ball deformation is likely to decrease z , R ' = ( r s + z ' ) l ~ < r ( 1 + r2 / 4R2 ) t . The value ~ r / ( 2R ) ' - may be neglected com - pared with unity . The entire theory of Hertz was developed in that approximation .

This fornmta determines the distance be - tween the opposite points of the ball and plane , depending upon their respective spacing from the contact area . Now , at the very contact area the distance between such points is not equal to zero , but to a certain value ~ ( of the order of magnitude of 3 to 4 / ~ ) ; therefore , should be added to the value z determinable by formula 23 . Thus , the final dependence z ( 1 , ) will become : Z ~ - - - a ( 1 , 2 _ _ ~ 2 ) ' _ _ ( 2a2 _ _ r ~ - ) Xarctan ( ~ - 1 ) ' + e . 23a Using this expression , one may calculate the component of the molecular interaction force acting between a plane and the surface of a deformed ball situated outside the contact area . Having recourse to an energetic approach and to the virtual displacement method , let us discuss the effect of this component of molecular interaction on adhesion of the ball to the plane . II . MACROSCOPIC CAI . CULATION OF A STICKING FORCE WHILE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE CONTACT DEFORMATIONS OF A BALL Let us calculate the energy of interaction of an elastic ball and a rigid plane , depending upon the amount a the center of the ball has approached the plane under the effect of an external force P and under that of surface and elastic forces . This energy is a stun of two parts ; namely , the volume energy of elastic deformations W , and the surface energy W , ( energy of molecular forces ) . It is generally supposed that the surface forces rapidly decrease as the distance diminishes , and that they are of a reversible equilibrium nature . The elastic energy is obviously equal to W , = F , ( oOdoe 24 where F , is the elastic force . Using the known method ( 3 ) , the surface energy may be represented as L w , = L ~ ( H ) 2 ~ , , t1 , . 2s Here , ~ ( H ) is the interaction energy per unit area of a flat surface ( an " analog of surface tension ) . The energy ~ o ( H ) rapidly decreases as H increases ; therefore , within the region H < < R , which is of interest to us , the precfse knowledge of the upper limit of integrating L in expression 25 is inessential ; it may simply be assumed to be equal to infinity . Moreover , in expression 25 the distance H is the known function of ~ and r , i . e . , H = H ( r , a ) . As at the contact surface , i . e . , at 0 ~ < r ~ < a , H = ~ = const . , then the corresponding part of free energy is equal to L a 11 " , ' = ~ ( e ) 2rcr , tr = ra - ~ so ( ~ ) 26 where ~ is the least possible spacing between the surfaces of the ball and the plane . Since , as has been shown earlier , then a - " = aR , 27 w , ' = ~ R ~ ( ~ ) . 283 136 B . V .

This last force is proportional to the contact area , and it would be found if the attraction energy " were varied due to the spacing varying , this varia - tion not being accompanied by , a change in the ball deformation .

It is apparent that as a grows the character of the dependence of force F , upon distance wtries , and at great values of a , F , tends to a constant value F , ' = 7rR¢ ( ~ ) = Fo / 2 .

Figure 3 represenls the character of the dependence of the tearing - off force Fd upon a . At first glance , it may become unclear why the force F , first decreases and then remains constant with flattening , i . e . , it depends only slightly , and contrary to what is expected , upon the contact area S . However , this may be clarified if one takes into consideration that the Hertz equations already account for the molecular attraction forces acting between the elements of contacting surfaces , with these forces actually participating in the elastic reaction of the surfaces . Yet the correction that we have introduced takes into account only the molecular attraction forces that are acting within the zone surrounding the contact area , and the width of this zone in the radial direction decreases as the flattening proceeds .

What concerns the area of contact between particles and a solid surface under the effect of molecular forces may be determined with formula S = 7ra ~ , or , taking into account rela - tionship 27 , with S = rraR . 60 In this case , the equilibrium value of a is determined from the condition of equality of molecular force Fm and elastic force F ~ . Here , the value of Fm is calculated by fornmla 52 , and that of F , is calculated by formula 49 . As an example , Table II presents the results of calculating the contact area S of poly - styrene particles on steel .

Since , even for small polystyrene particles found at the steel surface , the value of a / ~ > 1 , then for the analytical assessment of the dependence of the contact area upon the radius of the particles , one may use ( in accordance with Table I and fornmla 59 ) an approximate relationship : Fo A R 2 12d - TABI .

Its magni - tude remains equal to that calculated on the basis of assuming the presence of the point contact antl the absence of any contact deformation . Thus , at the very lnoment the point contact has been established , the tearing - off force should reach its maximum ( peak ) , balancing the resultant force of molecular attraction . That force is proportional to both the radius of a particle and the surface energy . In Ref . ( 4 ) , there is an incorrect discussion of the same problem of the effect of the nlolecular attraction forces on the contact deformation , and vice versa , that of the contact defom ~ ation on the sticking force ; this resulted in drawing an erroneous conclusion that taking into account the elastic deforma - tion on the basis of the Hertz theory should have resulted , not only in an abrupt increase in the sticking force , but also in the appearance of its quadratic dependence upon the radius of a particle .

Therefore , the value of . 5 " found in Ref . ( 4 ) is two times greater than the true one ) .

Limiting ourselves only to the former when interpreting the contact inter - action as was done in ( 4 ) , implies making a gross error which is of the same magnitude as the main component of term F ~ tt that was Selected Works - 3 141 taken into account by Dahneke in calculating the total sticking force . Therefore , if we correct this discrepancy , then instead of expression 11 that was derived by Dahneke for force F , we obtain Ad F - - - a t - 2 ( 2d ) l / 3khJ . 12Zo 2 This expression is likely to monotonically diminish in its absolute value with the growth of parameter h employed in the Hertz theory . Consequently , if we eliminate the chief error from the reasoning of the author of reference ( 4 ) , no conclusion can be drawn about the influence of elastic deformation on the adhesion of spherical particles . A plurality of other shortcomings ( drawbacks ) of the Dahneke work also will have to be noted . Instead of the modern theory of molecular attraction by Lifshits and his co - workers ( 10 ) , Dahneke uses calculations that are based on an assumption of the additivity of the paired interactions of molecules , an assumption that is known to be incorrect . In his final formulas , he uses such a value for the maximum approach of surfaces z0 to one another , which has not been accurately preset . The authors of the present paper have employed such an essentially thermodynamic approach , which enables one to obtain the parameter mentioned above . Trying to substantiate his conclusions by the published experimental data , Dahneke has ignored a number of works wherein the molecu - lar sticking force was found to be proportional to the first , but not to the second power of the radius of particles ( 12 , 13 ) . As for Ref . ( 14 ) , it covers investigating the sticking by the use of a dynamic method , wherein the tearing off was preceded by the pressing - on through an inertial force whose magnitude was equal to the tearing - off force set up in the second step of the process and was intended to overcome the sticking force . That the force required to overcome the sticking force obeyed the quadratic dependence upon the radius of particles was explained by the effect of a double electric layer forming during the pressing - on stage within the zone of the contact area . This explanation was corroborated quanti - tatively by the direct measurement of charges that were carried off by the particles after their tearing off the substrate ( 15 ) . Further , it is unclear why Dahneke , in criticizing that explanation , has described as semi - empirical the notion of a double electric layer at the boundary between two solids , which was first introduced by Helmholtz , as ' well as the asser - tion that the corresponding electrostatic attraction is proportional to the contact area . Dahneke contends that the difference in potentials between the plates of the double electric layer rarely reaches the value of 0 . 5 V . However , we have already presented data proving the contrary ( 16 , 17 ) . Independ - ently , we have presented in Ref . ( 15 ) the measurements of the charge of a particle being torn off , which show the charge density is sufficient for explaining the nleasured values of the sticking force . Dahneke has referred to a paper by Krupp ( 18 ) , trying to substantiate that the van der Waals ' sticking force component prevails over the electrostatic one . This reference is quite inadequate to support the above contention . The point is that the Krupp paper assumes that the contact deformation is , as a rule , plastic , which , by the way , cannot be con - ceded at all , as has already been pointed out above ( 16 ) . Dahneke himself considers it to be elastic , obeying the Hertz formulas based on the Hook ' s linear elasticity . In this case , the tearing - off process will occur in a reversible manner ( in the absence of electrostatic attrac - tion ) , and hence , during the tearing - off process the contact area will decrease gradually under the effect of an elastic reaction as the tearing - off force increases , thus tending to zero . Therefore , the tearing - off force should over - come the total molecular attraction force applied to the starting contact area , not at once as Krupp believed , but step by step . The molecular attraction forces of surfaces tend to decrease rapidly as the surfaces are 142 B . V . Derjaguin drawn apart . On the contrary , the electrostatic attraction of the plates of a double layer , which is separated as the contact has been broken up , does not diminish until a discharge and the neutralization of opposite charges occurs . This is the cause of the contact deformation within the elasticity range giving rise to an electric component of the sticking force , which is proportional to the maximum contact area . That is exactly what is able to give preponder - ance to the electrostatic component of the sticking force over the molecular one . to form under the effect of a pressing - on pulse all over the pressing - on area . When tearing off under the effect of inertia forces , the attraction forces between the plates of the double electric layer to be drawn apart considerably exceed the molecular sticking and ensure the proportionality between the sticking force and the square of the ball radius . This conclusion has been confirmed by the quantitative measurement of the density of a charge carried away when tearing off particles . GENERAL CONCI2USIONS We have developed here a strict theory of the mutual influence of the contact deforma - tion and the molecular attraction of a ball to a plane . The van der Waals ' forces are capable of increasing the area of elastic contact of the ball with the plane , yet it has been shown that the force , as required for overcoming the van der Waals ' forces and breaking up the contact , does not increase thereby and may be calcu - lated , if one considers the point contact of a nondeformed ball with a plane . The sticking force ( in the absence of the electrostatic component ) is proportional to the first power of the ball radius and to the work as required for effecting the equilibrium tearing off the flat surfaces of the same nature per unit area . The calculations done by Dahneke , which have resulted in the quadratic dependence of the sticking force upon the ball area , are grossly erroneous . The main error consists in considering the molecular repulsive forces equal to the normal elastic stress at the contact area , without taking into account the attraction forces . In ( 14 , 1S ) there the proportionality of the sticking force to the square of the radius of balls was established . This is explained by the effect of electric attraction forces between the plates of a double electric layer . In accord - ance with the conditions of the aforementioned cxperilnents , that double electric layer is likely REI , ' ERENCES 1 . BRAm . EV , R . S . , Philos . Mag . 13 , 8 . 53 ( 1932 ) ; Trans .
