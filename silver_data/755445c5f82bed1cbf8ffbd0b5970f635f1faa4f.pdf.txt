Combinations of two or more , possibly non - adjacent , domains are thought to play specific functional roles within proteins . Indeed , while the number of potential co - occurring domain sets ( CDSs ) is very large , only a few of these occur in nature . Here we study the principles governing domain content of proteins , using yeast as a model species . Results : We design a novel representation of proteins and their constituent domains as a protein - domain network . An analysis of this network reveals 99 CDSs that occur in proteins more than expected by chance . The identified CDSs are shown to preferentially include ancient domains that are conserved from bacteria or archaea . Moreover , the protein sets spanned by these combinations were found to be highly functionally coherent , significantly match known protein complexes , and enriched with protein - protein interactions . These observations serve to validate the biological significance of the identified CDSs . Conclusion : Our work provides a comprehensive list of co - occurring domain sets in yeast , and sheds light on their function and evolution . Background Protein domains are fundamental evolutionary units of protein architecture . They function as independent units and occur in different combinations , formed by duplica - tion , divergence and recombination of genes . In spite of their modularity , the actual number of combinations is only a small fraction of the number of potential combina - tions , mainly since the evolution of the protein repertoire is based on the expansion of existing protein families rather than on ab initio formation of new proteins [ 1 ] . While there is no doubt that the functionality of a protein is derived from its domain composition , the laws govern - ing the domain content of proteins are still largely unknown . The recent availability of large - scale data on the domain content of proteins ( in the form of sequence sig - natures [ 2 ] ) allows us to ask fundamental questions regarding protein architecture : What are the common attributes of proteins sharing certain domains ? Are domains used independently , or do they form synergistic combinations ?

Vogel et al [ 4 ] studied combinations of adjacent pairs or triplets of domains , referring to those as supra - domains . About half of the supra - domains were found to be overrepresented within proteins in all kingdoms of life ; moreover , these combinations occurred within proteins involved in a vari - ety of functions like metabolism , regulation and others . A follow - up study suggested that these combinations are formed once during evolution of the protein repertoire and are duplicated as a single evolutionary unit [ 5 ] . Wuchty et al . [ 6 ] and Ye et al . [ 7 ] studied domain combi - nations within proteins using a co - occurrence network of domains , where two domains are linked if they are found within the same protein . Wuchty et al . showed that many domain co - occurrence networks have a giant component containing the vast majority of the nodes . A comparison of domain networks across several genomes revealed that there are similar numbers of domains in higher and lower eukaryotes , while the sizes of highly connected domain subgraphs grow with evolution . This suggests that the increasing complexity of multicellular organisms relates to the formation of new domain combinations . Ye et al . partitioned the co - occurrence network of domains into clusters and showed that domains within the same cluster tend to have similar functions . Betel et al . [ 8 ] devised a method to identify pairs of domains from different proteins that tend to co - occur within the same protein complex . They studied the global properties of the resulting domain networks from two dif - ferent protein complex sources : manually curated and large scale experiments , and found different topologies for these data sources . The former contained large sub - net - works corresponding to known biological assemblies , like ribosomal subunits . The latter was typically small - world and contained a few central hubs , mainly of RNA process - ing and binding domains . Hegyi and Gerstein [ 9 ] investi - gated the functional similarity of proteins that share domains . They found that about 80 % of protein pairs sharing the same domain combination also share the same function . They further showed that about two - thirds of single - domain proteins that share the same domain have the same function . On the other hand , they found that only 35 % of multi - domain protein pairs that share only a single domain , have the same function . Müller et al [ 10 ] suggested that changing the repertoire of domain partners in a combination , along with refinement and diversification of the domain repertoire , increases func - tional complexity . Other related works focused on identifying and analyzing domain - domain interactions . Several works aimed at inferring domain interactions from protein interactions [ 11 , 12 ] or integrating domain and protein interactions to better explain interactions at the domain level [ 13 ] . Oth - ers explored the interactions between families of domains , revealing that interactions within families are significantly more frequent than between families [ 14 ] , or associated between domain interactions and their co - occurrence within proteins in other organisms [ 15 ] . Here we perform a comprehensive study of the domain composition of proteins in yeast . First , we study single domains , characterizing sets of proteins sharing each domain and the distribution of domain connectivities . Second , we use a novel network representation of the domain data to identify combinations of domains that co - occur in proteins more than expected by chance . In differ - ence from previous works , our framework allows the iden - tification of combinations of any size ; moreover , these combinations are allowed to occur non - contiguously along the protein . We study the functional significance of these combinations , which we term co - occurring domain sets ( CDSs ) , and the sets of proteins they induce . Results Bipartite graph representation of proteins and domains We analyzed the domain content of 3 , 321 S . cerevisiae proteins annotated with 1 , 588 domains from the Interpro database [ 2 ] . We represented these data using a bipartite graph , whose nodes correspond to proteins and domains , and whose edges connect proteins to their constituent domains ( Figure 1A and Methods ) . In agreement with previous studies [ 16 , 17 ] , we found the distribution of the number of connections ( degree ) per protein to be expo - nential ( data not shown ) . In contrast , we found that the degree distribution of domains follows a power law ( Fig - ure 1B ; p < 0 . 0001 ) . Next , we investigated the relation between protein degree and domain degree . We identified a significant positive correlation between the degree of a protein and the degrees of its constituent domains ( Figure 1C ) : Multi - domain proteins tend to consist of abundant domains , i . e . , domains that are found within at least four proteins . On the other hand , single - domain proteins tend to con - tain rare domains ( p < 0 . 0238 by Spearman correlation test ) . When further comparing the distributions of domain degrees in single - domain and multi - domain ( having 3 domains or more ) proteins , we observed that the distributions are significantly different ( p < 0 . 0013 by a Wilcoxon rank sum test ) . Interestingly , a recent study [ 18 ] reported that hub proteins , having many interacting partners , tend to be multi - domain . In agreement with that study , we found that hub proteins in the yeast PPI net - BMC Genomics 2007 , 8 : 161 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2164 / 8 / 161 Page 3 of 10 ( page number not for citation purposes ) work are significantly multi - domain , compared to non - hub proteins ( p < 7 . 9e - 6 , hypergeometric score , see Meth - ods ) . Furthermore , the average degree of domains within these hubs was significantly larger than that for non - hubs ( 4 . 414 vs . 2 . 68 ; p < 8 . 5e - 6 by a hypergeometric test ) . In light of this finding , our results suggest that the abundant domains found in multi - domain proteins may be impor - tant for their protein - protein interaction ability . Co - occurring domain sets We used the graphic representation to explore the reper - toire of CDSs within yeast proteins . In the protein - domain bipartite graph representation , such a combina - tion is represented by a biclique ( a fully connected bipar - tite subgraph , see Figure 1A ) . Specifically , a biclique on a set of proteins P and a set of domains D , implies that every protein in P contains all the domains in D and , hence , suggests D as a functional CDS . The more proteins in P the more support for the combination D . We score a biclique according to the chance of observing it at random ( see Methods ) . The problem of searching for the highest - scor - ing biclique in our setting is computationally hard [ 19 ] ; nonetheless , we exploit the fact that each protein contains a relatively small number of domains ( up to 7 in our data ) Bipartite graph representation of proteins and domains Figure 1 Bipartite graph representation of proteins and domains .

In bold is a biclique with five proteins and four domains . The biclique ' s proteins include acetyl - CoA carboxylase , pyruvate carboxylase 1 and 2 , urea amidolyase and HFA1 ( SwissProt IDs YNR016C , YGL062W , YBR218C , YBR208C and YMR207C ) . The proteins share four domains : Carbamoyl - phosphate synthase L chain , Carbamoyl - phosphate synthetase large chain N - terminal , Biotin carboxylase C - terminal and Biotin / lipoyl attachment ( Interpro IDs IPR005479 , IPR005481 , IPR005482 and IPR000089 ) .

In total , we identified 99 significant bicliques in the yeast protein - domain network , each corresponding to a distinct CDS [ See Additional file 1 ] . An overview of the identified bicliques is given in Figure 2 . The distributions of biclique sizes in terms of their numbers of proteins and domains are shown in Suppl . Figure S1 . A direct comparison with the combinations in Vogel et al [ 4 ] is not possible , as the latter focused on kingdom - rather than organism - specific combinations and exam - ined only contiguous domain combinations . However , our organism - specific application yielded 89 new combi - nations that were not included in [ 4 ] . In particular , 14 % of the combinations we identified included more than 3 domains , and 20 % of the combinations had at least one non - adjacent occurrence ( i . e . , a protein in which the com - bination does not occur contiguously ) . This demonstrates the utility of our method that can search for CDSs , involv - ing any number of possibly non - adjacent domains . Some of the CDSs we identified were well supported by previous studies . For example , we identified a combina - tion consisting of the VHS domain ( IPR002014 ) and the UIM ( ubiquitin interacting motif ) domain ( IPR003903 ) . The VHS domain has a membrane targeting role in vesic - ular trafficking in eukaryotic cells [ 20 ] . The UIM domain serves as a ubiquitin binding site [ 21 ] . The role of the combination of these domains was studied in the STAM2 ( signal - transducing adaptor molecule ) protein in [ 22 ] . It CDS network Figure 2 CDS network . Nodes correspond to CDSs ( bicliques ) . Two CDSs are connected by a blue or a red edge if they share at least one domain or protein , respectively ; and by a black edge if they share both . CDSs are color coded according to their GO func - tional enrichment ; they are numbered according to their scores , in ascending order . Highlighted are clusters involved in trans - port ( A ) , translation regulation ( B ) and motor activity , enzyme regulation and cell part ( C ) . BMC Genomics 2007 , 8 : 161 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2164 / 8 / 161 Page 5 of 10 ( page number not for citation purposes ) was shown that both VHS and UIM are required for ubiq - uitin binding . Specifically , the deletion of any one of these domains was shown to dramatically reduce the ubiquitin binding , whereas a mutant lacking both domains did not bind ubiquitin at all . As another example , we identified a combination of the motor region of the myosin head ( IPR001609 ) and the IQ calmodulin - binding region ( IPR000048 ) in the myosin family of proteins . These proteins are responsible for actin - based motility in eukaryotic cells , by using ATP hydrolysis to move on actin filaments [ 23 ] . They are char - acterized by three functional subunits : motor head , neck and tail . The head region , located at the N - terminal of the protein , is followed by the neck region . Both regions are well conserved in evolution ( in contrast to the tail region ) and are responsible for the actin - based movement . The head is composed of a single motor domain , which con - tains binding sites for ATP and actin [ 23 ] . The attached neck is composed of several repeats of the IQ calmodulin - binding region . This domain forms a rigid structure that serves as a mechanical lever , and the number of such domains in the neck determines the length of the lever arm and , hence , the step size of the myosin motor [ 24 ] . Functional annotation of CDSs and the associated proteins A statistically significant CDS suggests that its associated proteins are involved in similar biological processes . We examined whether the proteins in each of the CDSs exhib - ited functional coherency according to the gene ontology ( GO ) annotation ( Methods ) . We found that 89 out of the 99 CDSs ( 90 % ) were significantly functionally coherent ( Figure 2 ) . To avoid expected matches between the molec - Network of GO functions Figure 3 Network of GO functions . Nodes correspond to GO slim terms . Two nodes are connected if the corresponding terms signif - icantly share enriched combinations ( hypergeometric p - value < 0 . 05 ) . Edge width is determined by the number of shared pro - teins divided by the total number of proteins enriched in the corresponding GO terms . Edge widths were binned into 5 categories : [ 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 ) , [ 0 . 2 – 0 . 3 ) , [ 0 . 3 – 0 . 4 ) , [ 0 . 4 – 0 . 5 ) , [ 0 . 5 – 0 . 6 ) . BMC Genomics 2007 , 8 : 161 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2164 / 8 / 161 Page 6 of 10 ( page number not for citation purposes ) ular functions of proteins that contain the same set of domains , we repeated the functional coherency analysis when focusing on the GO biological process annotation . 77 out of the 99 CDSs ( 78 % ) were found to be signifi - cantly coherent in this latter analysis . Finally , we exam - ined the correspondence between the enriched function of a biclique and the annotated functions of its domain . We found that 65 out of the 89 functionally coherent combinations ( 73 % ) contained at least one domain whose annotated function in InterPro matched the enriched function . These results serve as a further valida - tion of the significance of the identified combinations , as well as an indication of the biological function that can be attributed to each CDS . Bicliques sharing domains or proteins were further found to relate in function , as demonstrated by the biclique net - work in Figure 2 . The network exhibits a modular struc - ture where CDSs group together to form clusters with coherent function . For instance , the cluster shown in Fig - ure 2A contains several combinations of the P - type ATPase family domains . These domains are found in cat - ion transport enzymes like sodium , calcium , copper or plasma membrane proton transporting enzymes [ 25 ] . In accordance with this functional role , the cluster ' s proteins are enriched for the terms transport and ATPase activity . As a second example , the cluster in Figure 2B contains combinations of translation and elongation domains . These combinations are found in proteins that assist in delivering aminoacyl tRNA to the acceptor site of the ribosome during protein synthesis , and are also involved in the translocation of the synthesized protein chain from the A to the P site [ 26 ] . In accordance with this functional role , the cluster ' s proteins are enriched for translation fac - tor activity and nucleic acid binding . As a third example , the cluster in Figure 2C spans several different functions . Domain age in combinations Figure 4 Domain age in combinations . Shown is the fraction of ancient domains in a CDS ( number of standard deviations from the mean compared to random domain sets ) as a function of the score of the corresponding biclique . BMC Genomics 2007 , 8 : 161 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2164 / 8 / 161 Page 7 of 10 ( page number not for citation purposes ) Notably , some of the bicliques in this cluster share versa - tile domains like the SH3 domain ( 47 , 73 and 12 ) , a well known domain that mediates many diverse processes in the cell [ 27 ] . Accordingly , these bicliques are enriched with versatile functions such as motor activity , enzyme regulation and cell part . ( See Figure S3 for more details ) . To investigate the relations between the GO terms charac - terizing the identified CDSs , we also created a network of GO terms , where each node is a GO slim annotation and two nodes are connected if they significantly share enriched combinations ( Figure 3 and Methods ) . In this network one can see a dichotomy of the connected com - ponents : one contains basic , essential functions like cata - lytic or transporter activities , while the other contains higher , sophisticated functions like cell communication , development and cell - cycle . This suggests that each CDS can , in principle , be functionally associated to only one of these classes . Protein - protein interactions within bicliques The functional coherence of proteins within bicliques has led us to investigate the physical connections among them . We expected proteins sharing similar CDSs to inter - act with one another and to match known yeast com - plexes . To test whether proteins sharing a particular CDS tend to interact , we compared the fraction of interacting proteins within bicliques to the overall fraction of inter - acting pairs . We found that proteins sharing a CDS signif - icantly tended to co - interact ( p < 2 . 7e - 11 by a hypergeometric test ) . As we had a reliability estimate to each reported interaction ( Methods ) , we also compared the reliability distributions of within - biclique interactions and all other interactions . We found that the protein - pro - tein interactions within bicliques were significantly more reliable than other reported interactions ( p < 0 . 0014 by a Wilcoxon rank sum test ) . As further support for the identified functional relations between proteins sharing a CDS , we tested whether these protein sets are enriched for known protein complexes from the MIPS database [ 28 ] . To this end , we computed the fraction of bicliques whose protein sets significantly matched a known complex ( Methods ) . Since the MIPS catalog contains only a limited collection of complexes , we restricted our analysis to bicliques that included at least t proteins that were annotated as members of some complex in the MIPS catalog . Overall , 73 % ( 16 / 22 ) of the protein sets that had at least two MIPS annotated proteins were significantly enriched for a known complex ; and 89 % ( 8 / 9 ) of the sets having at least 3 MIPS annotated proteins were enriched . Domain age within combinations Finally , we studied the age distribution of domains within CDSs . To this end , we classified the yeast domains into ancient domains , which are found also in bacteria or archaea , and new domains , which are specific to yeast ( cf . [ 35 ] ) . CDSs were significantly enriched for ancient domains ( p < 9 . 3e - 7 , see Methods ) , and there was an evi - dent correlation between the score of a combination ( measuring its overrepresentation ) and its enrichment level ( p < 0 . 0047 by Spearman correlation test ) , as demon - strated in Figure 4 . To provide further support for the observed correlation , we compared the score distributions of bicliques that contain only ancient domains and all other bicliques . We observed a significant difference between the two distributions ( p < 0 . 0171 , by a Wilcoxon rank sum test ) , as further exemplified in Figure S4 . Discussion It has previously been shown that the repertoire of domain combinations in an organism ' s proteome is restricted to only a small fraction of the set of possible combinations [ 36 ] . Here we have used a novel representa - tion of proteins and their domains to investigate the land - scape of CDSs . We identified global properties of the protein - domain network , as well as specific highly recur - rent and biologically significant CDSs . On the global scale , we have shown that the degree distribution of domains in this network follows a power law , and that highly modular proteins tend to contain abundant domains and proteins with a small amount of domains tend to contain rare domains . On the local scale , we iden - tified highly recurrent CDSs and investigated the sets of proteins and domains that they induce . We observed that the proteins within these sets significantly tended to inter - act with one another , participate in similar biological processes , and be associated with the same protein com - plex . The CDSs were shown to include a significantly high fraction of ancient domains that are conserved from bac - teria or archaea . Our analysis relied on the Interpro database , which includes domain annotations from both structure - and sequence - based sources . In order to investigate the influ - ence of the domain type on our results , we devised a rough classification of domains into two categories : A domain is called sequence - based if it has a PRINTS [ 29 ] or SMART [ 30 ] source and structure - based if it has a PDB [ 31 ] , SCOP [ 32 ] or CATH [ 33 ] source . Out of 1588 domains in our data set , 359 ( 22 . 6 % ) are sequence - based and 975 ( 61 . 4 % ) are structure - based . Some domains have both sequence and structural annotations ( 19 . 2 % ) and some have neither ( 35 . 2 % ) . In addition , 1488 ( 93 . 7 % ) of the domains have a PFAM [ 34 ] source . As PFAM spans most of the domains in InterPro we focused our analysis on the other two types of domains . BMC Genomics 2007 , 8 : 161 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2164 / 8 / 161 Page 8 of 10 ( page number not for citation purposes ) First , we examined whether the functional coherency of bicliques is more prominent for structure - or sequence - based domains . To this end , we defined a biclique as structure - based if all its constituent domains were struc - ture - based , and sequence - based if it contained at least one sequence - based domain . ( We used asymmetric defini - tions here to overcome the 1 : 3 bias in the numbers of sequence - and structure - based domains in the data , respectively . ) We found that 88 . 5 % of the sequence - based bicliques and 92 . 1 % of the structure - based ones are func - tionally coherent . These rates are comparable to the observed 90 % rate when considering all domains . Fur - thermore , 28 % of the functionally coherent bicliques con - tained at least one sequence - based domain whose annotated function in InterPro matched the biclique ' s enriched function . Similarly , 70 . 8 % of the functionally coherent bicliques contained at least one structure - based domain whose annotated function matched the enriched function . These percentages nicely match the frequencies of sequence - and structure - based domains in the IntePro domain collection . Second , we tested the correlation between the domain type and the tendency of a containing protein to interact . Specifically , we compared the fraction of interacting pro - teins within either sequence - or structure - based bicliques to the overall fraction of interacting pairs . We found that proteins within bicliques of both types significantly tended to co - interact ( p < 0 . 0059 for sequence - based bicliques and p < 2 . 5e - 5 for structure - based ones ) . We con - clude that the domain type does not significantly bias the interaction enrichment results . While our work has produced a valuable list of CDSs in yeast , several of its limitations must be acknowledged . First , our method relies on accurate domain annotation of proteins . Even though InterPro is known to have a low false positive rate ( 0 . 2 % , see [ 37 ] ) , it is far from complete , covering only 67 % ( 3321 / 4930 ) of all SwissProt proteins . Second , in this work we adopted a combinatorial defini - tion of CDSs . That is , a combination was defined as a set of specific domains , and a protein was considered to have this combination only if it contained the exact same set of domains . More general definitions that treat domain occurrences in a probabilistic fashion ( e . g . , similar to the way that sequence motifs are defined , cf . [ 38 ] ) , together with additional domain data , may uncover additional sig - nificant combinations that were missed by the current analysis . Methods Data acquisition We downloaded the Interpro [ 2 ] domain annotations for SwissProt proteins [ 39 ] in the yeast S . cerevisiae . We con - sidered only Interpro entries of type domain and family , as described in Cohen - Gihon et al . [ 35 ] . In total , our data set contained 1 , 588 domains and 3 , 321 yeast proteins . Protein - protein interaction data were downloaded from the DIP database [ 40 ] ( July 2005 download ) , with a total of 15 , 147 interactions . The interactions were assigned reli - ability estimates which were computed using a logistic regression model that takes into account the experimental techniques with which each of the interactions was detected [ 41 ] . Manually - curated protein complexes were obtained from the MIPS database [ 28 ] . We considered all complexes at the leaves of the MIPS hierarchy ( excluding category 550 which includes complexes derived by high - throughput experiments ) . Levels greater than 3 were collapsed to level 3 ( i . e . , adding their proteins to the corresponding level 3 complex on the path to the root ) . Bipartite graph representation of proteins and domains We represented the domain content of proteins using a bipartite graph of domain and protein nodes whose edges connect proteins to their constituent domains . We assigned weights to the edges reflecting the chance of observing such edges in a random graph with the same node degrees . Precisely , for an edge connecting nodes of degrees d ' and d " , the edge ' s weight was set to - log ( d ' d " / m ) , where m represents the total number of edges in the graph [ 42 ] . Analysis of hub proteins in the yeast PPI network Hub proteins were classified as in Ekman et al . [ 18 ] as pro - teins involved in 8 or more interactions . To compute the enrichment of multi - domain proteins ( with at least 3 domains ) in hub proteins we used a hypergeometric score . In detail , let M denote the total number of proteins , let K denote the number of hubs , let N denote the number of multi - domain proteins , and let S denote the number of proteins that are both multi - domain and hub . Then the corresponding p - value is : Biclique search A biclique is defined as a fully connected bipartite sub - graph , i . e . , a subset of proteins P and a subset of domains D , such that each protein in P contains all the domains in D . The score of a biclique reflects the likelihood of observ - ing such a biclique in a random , degree preserving net - work , and is defined as the sum of the weights assigned to the biclique ' s edges . We focused on maximal bicliques p K i M K N i M N i S N K = ⎛ ⎝⎜ ⎞ ⎠⎟ − − ⎛ ⎝⎜ ⎞ ⎠⎟ ⎛ ⎝⎜ ⎞ ⎠⎟ = ∑ min ( , ) BMC Genomics 2007 , 8 : 161 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2164 / 8 / 161 Page 9 of 10 ( page number not for citation purposes ) that contain at least two domains and at least two pro - teins . To detect the highest - scoring bicliques we adapted the method of Tanay et al . [ 19 , 43 ] . Briefly , for each pro - tein we enumerated all possible combinations of the domains composing it ( up to 2 7 such combinations are possible in our data ) . Each such combination was assigned a score according to the weight it induces with respect to the protein ( i . e . , the sum of weights of the edges connecting the member domains to the protein ) . Iterating over all the proteins in the data set , for each combination C we obtained the total weight of a biclique whose domain set is C . By applying the same algorithm to ran - dom protein - domain graphs with the same node degrees ( see below ) , we were able to assign an empirical p - value to each CDS . The latter was determined by calculating the biclique ' s ranking in a list of 100 scores , representing the maximum weight obtained in each of 100 random runs . Only bicliques with p - value < 0 . 05 were retained ( see Suppl . Figure S2 ) . In total , we identified 99 significant bicliques . Randomized protein - domain bipartite graphs were cre - ated by starting with the original graph , and iteratively shuffling its edges while maintaining node degrees , using the " switch " method [ 44 ] . Functional coherency analysis Functional coherency of protein sets was based on the Gene Ontology ( GO ) [ 45 ] annotation . The analysis was conducted on the entire GO hierarchy , apart from the analysis related to the GO term network ( Figure 3 ) , which was based on 21 representative GO slim terms . For each biclique , we used a hypergeometric score to assess its func - tional coherency with respect to each of the terms , choos - ing the highest - scoring one and associating it with the biclique . We assigned each biclique an empirical p - value by comparing its hypergeometric score to that of 100 ran - dom protein sets of the same size . The resulting p - values were further corrected for multiple biclique testing using the false discovery rate ( FDR ) procedure . Protein sets with corrected p - values smaller than 0 . 05 were considered functionally coherent . MIPS complex enrichment analysis To quantify the correspondence between the bicliques we identified and known complexes from the MIPS database [ 28 ] , we applied a method described in [ 46 ] . Briefly , the set of proteins of each biclique was compared to the known yeast complexes cataloged in MIPS , and the most significant match was selected , using a hypergeometric score . Empirical p - values were calculated by comparing the hypergeometric scores to those obtained for random sets of proteins of the same size . These p - values were fur - ther FDR corrected for multiple testing . The fraction of sets with significant matches ( p < 0 . 05 ) was measured . Analysis of domain age distribution For each set of domains in a biclique , the enrichment of ancient domains was measured using a hypergeometric score and compared to the enrichments under random labelings of domains as ancient and new , respecting the size of each class .
