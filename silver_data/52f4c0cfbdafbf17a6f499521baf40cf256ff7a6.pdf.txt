Our review of 71 published research articles aims at contributing to the DSR body of knowledge by systematically collecting the dependent and independent variables experimentally tested . Here , we identify a lack of cumulative research in DSR as only very few theory constructs are ( re - ) used . The paper provides several implications for theory and an outlook on potentially fruitful avenues for future research . 1 . Introduction Experimental research is an established method and well suited for Design Science Research ( DSR ) . According to Adelman [ 1 ] “e xperiments are , by far , the most common and commonly thought of empirical evaluation method ” ( p . 294 ) . DSR which is concerned with the artificial , i . e . IT artifacts , can use experiments to systematically evaluate design alternatives and identify superior manifestations to evoke improvements [ 42 ] . A prominent illustration of the pervasion of experiments can be found in [ 28 ] who quotes experiments as one out of five evaluation methods . Hypotheses are an important element of a scientific process and are subject to “experimental or observational tests” ( [ 10 ] , p . 409 ) . A hypothesis specifies the relationship between independent and dependent variables [ 14 ] . A set of interrelated hypotheses is defined as a theory [ 14 ] . Therefore , beside the use of principles [ 28 ] and methodologies [ 43 ] , the use of a Design Theory is needed to be able to support or reject hypotheses . In general , within an experimental setting a Design Theory and its integrated hypotheses include at least one dependent variable , and one or more independent variables which can be systematically manipulated within the experiment procedure . With focus on IS design research , at least one independent variable can be manipulated through the design of an IT artifact . Conceptualizations have been made which are particularly suitable to support or reject hypotheses in DSR . A prevailing notation framed by Gregor [ 21 ] is the concept of an “ exterior mode ” which is concerned with “ why a certain feature ( X ) is superior in terms of a measurement ( M ) than a system without feature X ” ( p . 7 ) . Similar conceptualizations have been made by other researchers [ 7 , 36 ] . A review of existing literature is essential to get a “ firm foundation for advancing knowledge [ and ] facilitates theory development ” ( [ 58 ] , p . xiii ) . However , systematic reviews of theoretical constructs in general or with regard to specific research methods such as experimental research are rare in the domain of Information Systems . Fjermestdad and Hiltz [ 18 ] analyzed 200 experiments and offer a comprehensive overview on what has been studied including a detailed insight in the used variables and hypotheses . However , the study focuses only on Group Support Systems . More recently Larsen et al . [ 38 ] built upon the Inter - Nomological Network ( INN ) and offer an integrated tool which allows to build upon prior research by locating existing constructs and their measurements in the realm of behavioral science . Especially in terms of theory development and the use of existing knowledge , this lack is significant . Against this background , the objective of this paper is to systematically reveal theoretical constructs in DSR endeavors empirically evaluated through experiments . Since current studies are focusing on conference proceedings [ 42 ] , this study expands the current state of the art including research articles from IS journals . To address our research objective , this paper is guided by the following research question : Which constructs have been a part of Design Theories and are studied in experimental settings ? The remainder of this paper is structured as follows : In the following section , we present the research background of experiments in IS and Design Science . In Section 3 , we present our research 2016 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences 1530 - 1605 / 16 $ 31 . 00 © 2016 IEEE DOI 10 . 1109 / HICSS . 2016 . 554 4453 2016 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences 1530 - 1605 / 16 $ 31 . 00 © 2016 IEEE DOI 10 . 1109 / HICSS . 2016 . 554 4454 framework . The research method is described afterwards ( section 4 ) including the data collection and the coding procedure . Section 5 shows our findings and section 6 presents the discussion with some concluding remarks . 2 . Research Background 2 . 1 . Experiments in IS Research Experiments are valuable instruments used for empirical research in Information Systems [ 12 , 18 ] . Fjermestdad and Hiltz [ 18 ] , for example , present the intense use of experimental research in IS , particularly in the domain of Group Support Systems . Recently published contributions such as the development of a framework for the evaluation of experiments [ 42 ] further strengthen the use of experiments in IS research . One - fifth of all research in IS is conducted in a laboratory or field experiment [ 12 , 18 ] . Therefore , we are focusing on these types exclusively . We exclude experiments which are conducted in computer and simulation environments , since they are implemented within processing units and they do not need participant involvement [ 11 ] . For the administration of experiments , researchers have to take into account several specific conditions and assumptions which enable them to test particular properties and characteristics . Firstly , control mechanisms are needed to test these properties and characteristics . Following Fjermestdad and Hiltz [ 18 ] , we refer to a controlled experiment if “ two or more conditions [ are ] deliberately created and contrasted , other variables were controlled in some manner , and there was at least one independent and one dependent variable , which was measured and statistically analyzed ” ( p . 9 ) . Secondly , an independent variable ( s ) is manipulated in a systematic manner . Yaremenko et al . [ 60 ] summarize “ one or more independent variables are manipulated to observe their effects on one or more dependent variables ” ( p . 72 ) . The similarity of both descriptions [ 18 , 59 ] is to test descriptive , causal hypotheses about manipulable causes . To summarize , specific conditions and assumptions of experiments are two or more different groups within a designed and controlled setting [ 12 ] . Necessarily , one group is a treatment group , affected by stimuli , whereby the other group is controlled , without a stimulation . In this way , IS researchers are able to test and examine effects of the independent variable ( s ) on the dependent variable ( s ) in experimental settings [ 33 , 12 ] . The distinction between a laboratory and a field experiment is the setting in which the experiment is conducted . Laboratory experiments are implemented in a controlled environment where researchers are able to control the treatments and the setting itself . Field experiments are performed in the real world or a real world setting . Hence , an advantage of field experiments is generalizing real world situations in the experimental environment . Problems of field experiments are : ( a ) they are less controllable than laboratorial settings , and ( b ) the variation or manipulation of independent variables and factors or observation of these influences on the dependent variable is more difficult [ 12 , 33 ] . The use of experiments in IS research has been successfully shown in many cases . Central to all these cases is studying an IT artifact which can be an E - commerce website , a computer interface , a website design , a virtual world or tools and software applications . Illustrative examples of studies within a laboratory setting can be found in [ 15 ] analyzing the effects of human images in website designs , in [ 26 ] studying the effects of social presence for the design of recommendation agents and in [ 56 ] analyzing the differences between an user - guided and a system - controlled decision aid . Studies conducting field experiments can be found in [ 5 ] analyzing the competition between firms in online sponsored markets , [ 49 ] presenting the personalization - privacy paradox , [ 50 ] examining the effectiveness of website personalization or [ 51 ] studying the use of personal communication technologies ( i . e . email and short message service ) . Experiments are used to study a broad range of phenomena . Examples include the impact on usefulness [ 37 , 51 , 55 ] , social presence [ 37 , 61 ] , trust [ 15 , 26 ] , performance [ 61 , 9 ] or user behavior [ 50 ] . Conducting experiments allows conclusions to be drawn about superior design choices in terms of the dependent variable . For example , in [ 15 ] “ the high - human condition is perceived as most favorable and resulted in image appeal and social presence for users ” ( p . 554 ) , and thus , it is superior to a no - human image in terms of image appeal , social presence and trust . With the manipulation of independent variables , a set of design alternatives is addressed at the same time , since an explanation is given about why a specific design alternative is more favorable than another . Explaining “why” design alternatives are favorable or superior to others , the question is justified whether this kind of research follows the Design Science Research or not . 2 . 2 Design Theory Rooted in the distinction between the science of the natural and the science of the artificial , there are 4454 4455 primarily two research paradigms in IS research : Behavioral Science and Design Science [ 39 ] . Both paradigms are broadly represented in IS research whereby a growing number of researchers are concerned with Design Science ( see for instance [ 27 ] ) . Influential contributions , such as Design Science methodologies [ 43 ] or the seven guidelines by Hevner et al . [ 28 ] are further boosting Design Science Research . The use of experiments is a central method for the evaluation of artifacts in Design Science Research [ 28 , 44 ] . However , little research has been done so far on the relationship between DSR and the use of experiments ( e . g . [ 42 ] ) . In fact , there are only few studies addressing both aspects , including the work of Fjermestdad and Hiltz [ 18 ] analyzing theoretical constructs used in experimental settings and Mettler et al . [ 42 ] developing an evaluation framework for DSR and experiments . Based on the growing interest in DSR , we consider this as a gap . Especially , studies with a strong integration of theory and the evaluation method are needed to further advance DSR . This is of special significance since several researchers emphasize the importance of theory in DSR ( e . g . 54 , 20 , 22 ) . Especially within the discussion about Design Science , arguments are made that the pure focus on IT artifacts is too narrow for a social - technical discipline [ 40 , 11 , 35 ] . Along with concerns about the theory in DSR it is necessary to clarify what an “IS Design Theory ( ISDT ) ” is . For this paper and for experimental research in general , an ISDT is needed which is closer to the nature of experiments in a way that ISDT includes ( controlled ) variables which can be manipulated within the administration of the experiment and tested empirically . Thus , we need an understanding of Design Science which is not only focused on the IT artifact itself , but also on a Design Theory . There are various approaches to explain the role of theory in DSR . Based on Simon ’ s work about Science of the artificial [ 47 ] , Gregor [ 21 ] is arguing for a dualistic point of view in theorizing , proposing the interior and the exterior mode . Defined by Gregor “ the interior mode is where theorizing is done to produce theory for design and action , with prescriptive statements about how artifacts can be designed , developed and brought into being ” ( p . 7 ) , whereby the “ exterior mode includes other types of theory , which aim primarily at analyzing , describing and predicting what happens as artifacts exist and are used in their external environment ” ( p . 7 ) . Similar arguments are made by Baskerville and Pries - Heje [ 7 ] who split Design Theory in a Design Practice Theory and an Explanatory Design Theory . The Design Practice Theory explains how to build an IT artifact ; the Explanatory Design Theory explains why specific characteristics are used within the process of building an artifact and , thus , are able “ to explain range of phenomena rather than a specific instance of a problem ” ( p . 273 ) . A similar point of view is stated by Kuechler and Vaishnaivi [ 35 ] who propose the notion of a “ Design Relevant Explanatory / Predictive Theory ” ( DREPT ) which explains “ how and why the artifact functions as it does ; specifically , it explains how novel artifact design features have the effects they do” ( p . 397 ) . From all these various notions , we can derive crucial aspects in terms of a Design Theory . Firstly , to explain a “ range of phenomena ” [ 44 ] , it is necessary to generalize which can be achieved by using testable hypotheses . Secondly , following Gregor [ 21 ] , hypotheses should be framed as “ a system with feature X will perform better on measure M than a system without feature X ” ( p . 7 ) . Third ly , referring to the science of the artificial [ 47 ] , at least one feature is included in an IT artifact . To put it simply , a Design Theory is supposed to inform the designer of an IT artifact about which features to include and for what purpose . Bringing these aspects together , we propose the following definition of a Design Theory : A Design Theory is a collection of two or more connected hypotheses explaining desired effects ( dependent variable ) , whereby at least one independent variable ( feature ) can be designed through manipulation of an IT artifact . The use of this definition offers two essential benefits : ( 1 ) the emphasis on the use of hypotheses by the given definition is close to natural science . Therefore , it supports the integration of theories from behavioral science ( e . g . theories from sociology and social science ) . ( 2 ) without the constraint that all independent variables need to be within the IT artifact ( i . e . features ) , this definition allows a hybrid form of research . ( 3 ) with the emphasis on the use of hypotheses , empirical evaluation ( falsification ) is possible [ 14 ] . 3 . Research Framework In order to analyze constructs which have been studied in experimental settings , we briefly introduce our research framework ( see Figure 1 ) which will be the foundation of our structured analysis ( see 4 . 2 Data Coding ) . The research framework is composed of the IS Design Theory elements and elements relating to the experimental setting . For the IS Design Theory part , we include theory constructs ( i . e . independent and dependent variables ) . Furthermore , we differentiate between independent variables which are manipulated within an IT artifact ( e . g . human image on a website [ 15 ] ) , and variables which are outside the 4455 4456 IT artifact ( e . g . security behavior , self - efficacy [ 4 ] ) . Next , we integrate elements concerning the experimental setting . These include the description of the experimental setting ( e . g . randomized setting ) , the form of an experiment ( e . g . laboratory experiment ) and the subject group ( e . g . students ) . Finally , the measurement is included . We distinguish the following forms of measurement : the measurement method for the experiment itself ( e . g . surveys ) , and the measurement for the data analysis ( e . g . statistical methods ) . Besides the use of single measurements , there is considerable research using multi - measurement approaches , combining questionnaires with interviews and eye - tracking methods [ 15 ] or electroencephalography with questionnaires [ 23 ] . Figure 1 : Research framework 4 . Research Method 4 . 1 Data Collection To identify relevant articles , we conducted a literature search [ 53 ] . To gain a suitable amount of data for the exploration of theoretical constructs in Information Systems Research we selected two IS journals , i . e . Management Information Systems Quarterly ( MISQ ) and Information Systems Research ( ISR ) , because they include IS leading scholars’ works and are widely distributed in IS research . Using the keywords “ experiment ( s ) ” and “ experimental ” between 2005 and 2015 within titles , abstracts and in author keywords we were able to collect a significant number of papers on experiments for an in - depth analysis . Our search yielded 104 papers in total ( 50 ISR and 54 MISQ ) . We excluded from our search “issues and opinions” as well as “editorial notes” papers . Next , we studied all the articles and excluded those that are not using experiments to test hypotheses or match our understanding of an experiment in an experimental setting . The remaining 71 papers were analyzed in detail . 4 . 2 Data Coding The data coding procedure was conducted as follows : Firstly , we read five random papers of each journal , to identify aspects which are relevant for our research question . We categorized all aspects and together with elements of a Design Theory ( e . g . independent variable ) we integrated them in an initial coding scheme . Secondly , using the initial coding scheme , we read the residual papers individually and adjusted the scheme consequently . After each paper has been read by the first and second author , discrepancies were identified and discussed with a third researcher to adapt the coding scheme and come to a final agreement . The final scheme is illustrated in figure 1 . With the creation of an initial coding scheme and an iterative procedure , we followed the Template Based Approach [ 34 ] . We chose this approach because it allows us to start with an initial coding scheme based on our previous work and adapt it within the coding procedure . Finally , we analyzed the 62 dependent and 56 independent variables ( see Appendix ) for relationships . The process of relating similar codes to each other is in line with axial coding suggested by Grounded Theory [ 13 ] . This resulted in four subcategories ( c . f . table 1 ) which can be used as a starting point for researchers searching for system - related or user - related knowledge . (cid:2) System - design variables contain all variables that influence the design of an IT artifact ( e . g . websites , displays , images or other visual design features ) . Examples are E - Images [ 19 ] or navigation systems [ 57 ] . (cid:2) User - design variables include all variables that are influencing users ’ behavior and attitude directly or indirectly . Examples are content quality [ 41 ] or the amount of provided information [ 31 ] . (cid:2) System - related effects include all aspects looping back to the system to enhance its functions or usability . Examples are performance [ 9 ] or form response [ 2 ] . (cid:2) User - related effects compromise all outcomes of the experimental manipulation on the side of the system user and contain , for example , changes in attitude ( e . g . trust [ 15 ] ) , intention ( e . g . intention to return [ 57 ] ) , behavior ( e . g . bidding behavior [ 30 ] ) , or capability ( e . g . learning outcomes [ 25 ] ) . Independent Variables System - design variables User - design variables 4456 4457 Dependent Variables System - related effects User - related effects Table 1 : Categorization of the variables In terms of the experimental setting , we identified the aspects of the experimental description and design including general aspects of experiments ( e . g . field vs . laboratory experiments ) , the subject group and the used measurement approaches . Furthermore , we identified all independent and dependent variables systematically . Following our definition of Design Science ( defining criterion : Design Theory ) , we classified research articles having an independent variable within an IT artifact as Design Science . If an article deals with theory in which no variable is subject to manipulation through an IT artifact , we classify it as Behavioral Science . 5 . Findings Our study reveals that much of the experimental research in IS features elements of Design Theory . Following our definition , an overall of 44 ( 62 % ) of the reviewed articles are using a Design Theory . With regard to the variables , 57 % of the independent variables are system - design related and 44 % are user - design variables . Furthermore , 24 % of the dependent variables ( effects ) are system - related , whereby 76 % are user - related . Table 2 illustrates an extract of our findings ; table 4 and table 5 in the Appendix include a comprehensive overview of our findings . Independent Variables System - design variables ( 57 % ) User - design variables ( 43 % ) Display order [ 17 ] Human image [ 15 ] E - Image [ 19 ] Preferred distance [ 29 ] Feedback [ 6 ] Privacy [ 52 ] Dependent Variables System - related effects ( 24 % ) User - related effects ( 76 % ) Query performance [ 3 ] Form response [ 2 ] Ad performance [ 5 ] Consumer learning [ 48 ] Bidding behavior [ 30 ] Intention to return [ 32 ] Table 2 : Independent and dependent variables We further derived major findings in terms of the organization and conduction of experiments ( c . f . Table 3 ) . Firstly , 80 % of the reviewed articles are using a laboratory setting . Only 16 % are conducted in a field experiment and 4 % are applying a mixed approach . Almost all of the experiments are conducted in a randomized manner ( 98 % ) , only 2 % of the reviewed articles are applying quasi - experiments ( i . e . participant assignment done by the researchers ) . In terms of the experimental design , the majority of research relies on a between - subject design ( 73 % ) , 11 % are using a within - subject design and the remaining 16 % are using a hybrid approach . Secondly , in a majority of the reviewed experiments , research students ( undergraduate as well as graduate students ) are participating in the experimental procedure ( 73 % ) . Only about every fourth study is incorporating specific subject groups such as university staff , workers , managers , software developers or IT users ( 23 % ) and only 2 % is using both . Thirdly , the most commonly used method for the evaluation are questionnaire - based surveys ( 65 % ) . In addition , other methodological approaches are multi - method approaches in which the combination of two or more methods is applied ( 27 % ) . Typical methods used in combination are : questionnaires , interviews , eye - tracking methods or neurophysiological ( Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging , Electroencephalography , Skin Conductance Response etc . ) . A few researchers utilize other forms such as online data ( 9 % ) . For the analysis of the data 21 articles are using descriptive statistics , 24 are applying an ANOVA analysis , 15 articles are using MANOVA , 3 articles are including ANCOVA method for their analysis and 4 papers MANCOVA . To check distinct models in the research model the Partial Least Squares ( PLS ) method is used 12 times and the structural equation modeling 5 times . In 18 articles pre - test and statistical analysis is made by other methods ( e . g . chi - square , hypothesis ( t - ) test etc . ) . All over , in 38 ( 86 % ) paper the researcher conducted a multi - analysis approach .

Discussion Our systematic analysis of constructs studied in experimental settings reveals a broad spectrum of knowledge used in system - related and user - related research . Based on this insight , we derive four major results , which we expose in the following . Research paradigm in experimental settings : More than half of the reviewed research articles match our definition of a Design Theory and , thus , can be classified as Design Science . This is remarkable , since some researchers would understand themselves as researchers in the field of behavioral science ( see for instance [ 8 ] ) . The major reason for this result rests upon our understanding and definition of a Design Theory , since we strictly analyzed whether there is an independent variable which is manipulated within an IT artifact or not . Therefore , our understanding of Design Science , Design Theory and the question of why specific components are constructed into an IT artifact is in line with the e xterior mode [ 21 ] , with the Explanatory Design Theory [ 7 ] , and with the Design - Relevant Explanatory / Predictive Theory [ 35 ] . On the use of experiments : A majority of research is using laboratory experiments ( 80 % ) , having the advantage of a controlled and artificial environment where particular treatments can be tested with diverse subject groups [ 12 ] . However , in contrast to field experiments , laboratory experiments are more distanced to real world scenarios than field experiments . Especially in terms of studying technology in everyday life , such as Consumer IT , an artificial environment might be a disadvantage . Our findings imply that questionnaire - based surveys are the most favored method to evaluate experiments . One reason might be a broad knowledge in terms of the method and its application . However , recent developments in the domain of neurophysiology offers new methods ( e . g . [ 45 ] or [ 46 ] ) which seems to be more reliable in terms of their evaluation [ 16 ] . Until now , only a few researchers have combined traditional methods ( e . g . questionnaires ) with neurophysiological approaches ( e . g . electroencephalography ) [ 24 ] . Area of use : The differentiation between system - related variables and user - related variables shows that both areas are relevant for IS research and are studied by using experimental settings . However , the majority of effects are concerned about user - related effects . The reason for this emphasis could be due to the background of the researcher , e . g . from Human - Computer - Interaction or with a focus on End - User Research . Thus , we have less experimental work with system - related effects . On the one hand this is strengthening user - related research , but on the other hand it weakens Design Science endeavors which are concerned with system - related aspects . Theoretical constructs in experimental settings ; a matter of integration : There is a broad spectrum of variables empirically tested in experimental settings . However , only a small number of concrete variables are used or reused by more than one article . This heterogenic and poorly integrated map is critical since research pursues to build upon existing knowledge [ 58 , 53 ] . One reason for this may lie in the enormous amount of constructs empirically studied in IS research . Addressing this issue , we provide an initial step to support future research to build their endeavors on “ the shoulder of giants ” [ 53 ] by systematically consolidate system - related and user - related knowledge . Limitations and outlook : Our study has certain limitations . Firstly , due to the choice of two IS journals and the restricted time - period , we are not able to capture a comprehensive review of all constructs studied in experimental settings . We rather focused on an in - depth review of current articles . Further research could enrich our contribution by including more papers of IS journals and conferences to complement our initial work . Secondly , the differentiation between system - related and user - related constructs is only a first step towards a systematic representation of the constructs . Further research is needed to analyze the data in a more detailed way . With regard to the broad spectrum of theories used in IS research , methods such as theoretical coding as part of Grounded Theory [ 13 ] could help to go one step further and identify the connection between the revealed constructs and existing theories . Besides addressing the limitations , potential future research could cover the following points : Apart from our approach to differentiate between system - related and user - related aspects , new conceptualizations can be developed to support specific areas of interest such as mobile technologies . Furthermore , we encourage researchers to continue the discussion about DSR and the role of theory , especially in terms of common features of both paradigms .
