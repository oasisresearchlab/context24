Previous studies on the 19 highly branched C . elegans PVD sensory neuron identified a membrane co - receptor complex 20 that links extracellular signals to intracellular actin remodeling machinery , promoting high - order 21 dendrite branching . In this complex , the claudin - like transmembrane protein HPO - 30 recruits the 22 WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) to dendrite branching sites , stimulating the Arp2 / 3 complex 23 to polymerize actin . We report here our biochemical and structural analysis of this interaction , 24 revealing that the intracellular domain ( ICD ) of HPO - 30 is intrinsically disordered and employs 25 two distinct mechanisms to regulate the actin cytoskeleton . First , HPO - 30 ICD binding to the 26 WRC requires dimerization and involves the entire ICD sequence , rather than a short linear 27 peptide motif . This interaction enhances WRC activation by the GTPase Rac1 . Second , HPO - 30 28 ICD directly binds to the sides and barbed end of actin filaments . Binding to the barbed end 29 requires ICD dimerization and inhibits both actin polymerization and depolymerization , 30 resembling the actin capping protein CapZ . These dual functions provide an intriguing model of 31 how membrane proteins can integrate distinct mechanisms to fine - tune local actin dynamics . 32 33 Kramer et al 3 Introduction 34 Neurons exhibit a variety of shapes , but they all share a fundamental architecture 35 comprising a cell body , a primary axon , and many branching dendrites adorned with numerous 36 tiny projections called spines ( Burianek and Soderling , 2013 ; Jan and Jan , 2003 ; Lefebvre et al . , 37 2015 ) . Dendrite and spine formation is critical for nervous system development , as they establish 38 the majority of post - synaptic connections in animals and define the intricate wiring of neural 39 circuits ( Hotulainen and Hoogenraad , 2010 ; Scott and Luo , 2001 ; Tavosanis , 2012 ) . Actin and 40 microtubule filaments are essential for initiating and promoting the outgrowth of newly formed 41 neurites during dendrite development ( Cheng and Poo , 2012 ; Zhao et al . , 2017 ) . Disruptions in 42 actin cytoskeleton regulation can alter dendrite morphology and neural connections , contributing 43 to various neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism , mental retardation , and schizophrenia 44 ( Yan et al . , 2016 ) . 45 A primary mechanism by which neurons regulate actin polymerization involves the 46 Arp2 / 3 complex , a seven - protein assembly that binds to the sides of existing actin filaments and 47 promotes the formation of branched actin filament networks ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ; Hasegawa 48 et al . , 2022 ; Machesky et al . , 1994 ; Pollard , 2007 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex is intrinsically inactive 49 and requires activation by nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) , which primarily consist of the 50 Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome Protein ( WASP ) family proteins ( Alekhina et al . , 2017 ; Kramer et 51 al . , 2022 ; Pollitt and Insall , 2009 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . These proteins contain a 52 conserved WCA ( WH2 - central - acidic ) sequence at their C terminus , which can directly bind to 53 and activate Arp2 / 3 . The N - terminal sequences of these proteins vary greatly and define their 54 regulatory mechanism and cellular function ( Alekhina et al . , 2017 ; Kramer et al . , 2022 ; 55 Machesky and Insall , 1998 ) . 56 WAVE ( Wiskott - Aldrich Verprolin homology ) belongs to the WASP family and is part 57 of a multi - protein assembly known as the WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) . Consisting of five 58 subunits—Sra1 , Nap1 , Abi2 , HSPC300 , and WAVE ( or their corresponding orthologs in 59 vertebrates ) ( Chen et al . , 2010 ; Eden et al . , 2002 ; Gautreau et al . , 2004 ; Polesskaya et al . , 2021 ; 60 Rottner et al . , 2021 ) —the WRC facilitates actin polymerization downstream of membrane 61 signaling in neurons . This activity is crucial for various neuronal processes , including growth 62 cone formation , axon branching , dendrite branching , synapse formation , and axon guidance and 63 projection ( Chia et al . , 2014 ; Chou and Wang , 2016 ; Pilpel and Segal , 2005 ; Racz and Weinberg , 64 Kramer et al 4 2008 ; Soderling et al . , 2007 ; Stephan et al . , 2011 ; Tahirovic et al . , 2010 ; Yamazaki et al . , 2005 ; 65 Yokoyama et al . , 2011 ) . Disruption of WRC function can profoundly affect the nervous system 66 in animals , resulting in altered spine morphology and density , intellectual disability , and 67 embryonic death ( Dahl et al . , 2003 ; Soderling et al . , 2003 ) . Mutations in WAVE and other WRC 68 subunits have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders in humans , including 69 neurodevelopmental disorder with absent language and variable seizures ( NEDALVS ) , 70 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy - 65 ( DEE - 65 ) , and Alzheimer’s disease ( Begemann 71 et al . , 2021 ; Conway et al . , 2018 ; Ito et al . , 2018 ; Kirkpatrick et al . , 2017 ; Kramer et al . , 2022 ; 72 Kumar et al . , 2013 ; Olive et al . , 2020 ; Rottner et al . , 2021 ; Shimojima Yamamoto et al . , 2021 ; 73 Sims et al . , 2017 ; Srivastava et al . , 2021 ; Zhao et al . , 2021 ; Zweier et al . , 2019 ) . 74 The WRC inhibits WAVE activity by sequestering its C - terminal WCA to a conserved 75 surface formed by the Sra1 and WAVE subunits ( Chen et al . , 2017 , 2010 ; Eden et al . , 2002 ; 76 Kramer et al . , 2022 ) . Various molecules can recruit the WRC to the membrane and / or 77 simultaneously activate it through direct interactions , releasing the WCA to promote Arp2 / 3 - 78 mediated actin polymerization . These ligands include small GTPases ( e . g . , Rac1 and Arf ) , acidic 79 phospholipids ( e . g . , PIP 3 ) , adaptor proteins , and a wide array of membrane proteins containing 80 the WIRS motif ( WRC interacting receptor sequence , defined as F - x - T / S - F - x - x , where F is a 81 bulky hydrophobic residue and x is any residue ) ( Chen et al . , 2017 , 2014a , 2010 ; Ding et al . , 82 2022b ; Eden et al . , 2002 ; Kobayashi et al . , 1998 ; Koronakis et al . , 2011 ; Lebensohn and 83 Kirschner , 2009 ; Rottner et al . , 2021 ; Yang et al . , 2022 ) . Many WIRS - containing membrane 84 proteins , such as SYG - 1 , Robo , DCC , Neogenin , TMEM132 , neuroligins , and various 85 protocadherins , are essential neuronal receptors that depend on the WIRS - WRC interaction to 86 regulate diverse neural development processes ( Chaudhari et al . , 2022 , 2021 ; Chia et al . , 2014 ; 87 Fan et al . , 2018 ; Lee et al . , 2016 ; Wang et al . , 2021 ; Xing et al . , 2018 ) . 88 In previous studies , the claudin - like receptor HPO - 30 was identified as a novel WRC - 89 binding protein , which does not contain a WIRS motif . The HPO - 30 - WRC interaction is 90 essential for high - order dendrite branching in the PVD sensory neuron in C . elegans ( Zou et al . , 91 2016 ) . HPO - 30 acts as a co - receptor with the cell adhesion molecule DMA - 1 . The extracellular 92 domain of DMA - 1 forms a multi - ligand complex with the secreted protein LECT - 2 and the 93 extracellular domains of the epidermal cell receptors SAX - 7 and MNR - 1 , providing spatial cues 94 for initiating dendrite branching in PVD neurons ( Dong et al . , 2013 ; Zou et al . , 2018 , 2016 ) . The 95 Kramer et al 5 intracellular domain ( ICD ) of HPO - 30 directly binds to the WRC , while the ICD of DMA - 1 96 binds the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) TIAM - 1 , increasing the local 97 concentration of activated Rac1 , the canonical activator of WRC ( Tang et al . , 2019 ; Zou et al . , 98 2018 ) . Together , the HPO - 30 - DMA - 1 co - receptor organizes a multi - protein complex that bridges 99 extracellular cues to the intracellular actin remodeling machinery to regulate high - order dendrite 100 branching ( Zou et al . , 2018 ) . 101 The interaction mechanism between HPO - 30 ICD and the WRC remains elusive , and it is 102 uncertain if the ICD has additional functions beyond its WRC binding activity . Unlike other 103 WRC - binding membrane proteins , HPO - 30 ICD lacks a WIRS motif and uses a non - WIRS 104 mechanism for WRC interaction . Prior research has shown that deletion of the C - terminal half of 105 the HPO - 30 ICD strongly affects WRC binding in vitro and high - order dendrite branching in 106 vivo . However , it is unclear whether the HPO - 30 ICD uses a linear peptide motif analogous to 107 the WIRS motif for WRC binding ( Zou et al . , 2018 ) . Although HPO - 30 shares homology with 108 mammalian tight junction claudin proteins , its ICD sequence is conserved only in nematode 109 worms . Intriguingly , HPO - 30 ICD binds to both C . elegans and human WRC , suggesting a 110 conserved interaction mechanism across species ( Zou et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , understanding the 111 HPO - 30 - WRC interaction is critical for identifying other potential membrane proteins that 112 regulate the WRC in humans through the same interaction surface . 113 In this study , we conducted biochemical and structural analyses of the HPO - 30 - WRC 114 interaction . Our findings reveal that the HPO - 30 ICD differs from other WRC - interacting 115 receptors , as the entire ICD sequence—rather than a short peptide motif like the WIRS—is 116 involved in the interaction . We also discovered that dimerization is necessary for HPO - 30 ICD to 117 bind to the WRC , which works cooperatively with Rac1 to promote WRC activation . 118 Surprisingly , we found that the HPO - 30 ICD directly interacts with actin filaments in a 119 dimerization - dependent manner . The dimeric form of HPO - 30 ICD binds to both the side and the 120 barbed end of actin filaments , inhibiting both actin polymerization and depolymerization , 121 resembling the activity of the actin capping protein CapZ . These dual activities of HPO - 30 ICD 122 present a fascinating example of how a membrane receptor can regulate local actin dynamics by 123 simultaneously controlling the localization and activity of a central actin nucleation factor and 124 directly binding to and modulating actin filaments to support an essential biological process . 125 126 Kramer et al 6 Results 127 HPO - 30 ICD uses the entire sequence , rather than a short peptide motif , to bind the WRC 128 The HPO - 30 ICD lacks a WIRS motif , which led us to hypothesize that it might use a 129 different linear motif to bind the WRC . To identify this potential sequence motif , we divided 130 HPO - 30 ICD sequence into continuous segments of five amino acids ( a . a . ) ( D 1 - 10 in Figure 1A ) 131 and mutated all a . a . in each segment to alanines . We then used GST pull - down assays to assess 132 the impact of each segment on WRC binding ( Figure 1B ) . Interestingly , we found that mutating 133 nearly any segment reduced the binding to WRC , with the middle region of the ICD showing the 134 most significant effect ( ∆5 , 6 , 7 in Figure 1A , B , lanes 7 - 9 ) . This finding supports the previous 135 qualitative data obtained under suboptimal pull - down conditions ( Zou et al . , 2018 ) . It is worth 136 noting that while most mutants contained a N - terminal GST - tag , several mutations near the C - 137 terminus of the ICD used a C - terminal GST - tag to improve the yield of full - length protein ( ∆8 - 138 ∆10 in Figure 1 , lanes 10 - 13 in Figure 1B ) . 139 It is interesting that none of the alanine - scan mutations completely abolished the binding 140 to WRC , unlike WIRS - mediated binding where single amino acid mutations in the WIRS motif 141 can readily eliminate the interaction ( Chen et al . , 2014a ) . In line with this finding , the wild type 142 ( WT ) ICD had a dissociation constant ( K D ) of ~ 1 . 69 µM , as measured by an equilibrium pull - 143 down ( EPD ) assay ( Figure 1D , black and Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A ) , while the alanine - 144 scan mutant ∆5 , which had the strongest effect in the non - equilibrium GST pull - down assay 145 ( Figure 1A , B , lane 7 ) , only mildly increased the K D to ~ 5 . 06 µM , still maintaining significant 146 residual binding ( Figure 1D , light yellow and Figure 1 – figure supplement 1B ) ( Chen et al . , 147 2017 ; Kuzmic , 1996 ; Pollard , 2010 ) . More extensive mutations in the ICD , either in the N - 148 terminal , middle , or C - terminal regions , more severely disrupted the binding ( Figure 1A , C ∆11 - 149 14 ) . These data suggest the entire ICD sequence is involved in interacting with the WRC . This is 150 distinct from WIRS - containing membrane proteins where the WIRS motif is essential for 151 binding the WRC , and sequences outside the WIRS motif have only marginal contributions , if 152 any ( Chen et al . , 2014a ) . 153 154 HPO - 30 ICD contains residual structural elements , but is predominantly disordered in 155 solution 156 Kramer et al 7 Two potential models could explain how the entire ICD of HPO - 30 binds to the WRC : 157 either the ICD might fold into a three - dimensional structure to bind , or the ICD might exist as an 158 extended linear peptide that makes an extensive contact with the WRC . To distinguish between 159 these two models and understand how the binding occurs , we investigated the structure of the 160 ICD using various approaches . 161 First , we submitted the sequence of ICD to multiple in silico structural prediction 162 software . These programs include secondary structure analyses ( JPred , PredictProtein , PSIPred , 163 and SABLE ) and ab initio tertiary structure predictions ( LOMETS , QUACK , RaptorX , Rosetta , 164 AlphaFold 2 . 0 , and RoseTTAFold ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) ( Adamczak et al . , 2004 ; 165 Bernhofer et al . , 2021 ; Bonneau et al . , 2001 ; Drozdetskiy et al . , 2015 ; Jumper et al . , 2021 ; 166 Källberg et al . , 2012 ; McGuffin et al . , 2000 ; Minkyung et al . , 2021 ; Wu and Zhang , 2007 ) . 167 Nearly all programs predicted that the ICD contains a short alpha helix followed by two short 168 beta strands ( Figure 1A ) . This is distinct from WIRS - containing proteins , where the WIRS motif 169 must reside in unstructured sequences for proper binding . It is noteworthy that the sequences 170 most critical for binding , such as ∆5 , ∆6 , and ∆7 in Figure 1 , are within or close to these 171 secondary structural elements . In contrast to the consistent secondary structure prediction , 172 however , tertiary structure predictions yielded varied results , in which the secondary structural 173 elements are folded differently depending on the program and the context of ICD sequence 174 ( isolated ICD vs . full - length HPO - 30 ) used for the predictions ( Figure 1—figure supplement 175 2 ) . The variability observed in the predictions suggests that the ICD may not adopt a well - 176 defined three - dimensional structure , but rather may exist as a large and heterogeneous 177 conformational ensemble . 178 To further assess these structural predictions , we performed a series of all - atom 179 molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations using the AMBER99SB - disp force field , which combines 180 a new generation of water model with parameters specifically designed to capture the behavior of 181 partially disordered proteins in solution ( Robustelli et al . , 2018 ) . The top - ranking conformations 182 from all eight predictions were subjected to 200 - ns simulations to assess the conformational 183 stability of the predicted structural models . The trajectories showed significant conformational 184 fluctuations , with large root mean square deviation ( RMSD ) up to 20 Å from their corresponding 185 initial models ( Figure 1 – figure supplement 3 ) . The snapshots of the simulated molecules 186 revealed major random reorganization of the structural elements , suggesting that the predicted 187 Kramer et al 8 tertiary structures were transient or unstable conformations , or may require specific conditions or 188 contexts to exist . Notably , in almost all simulated structures , the alpha - helical region remained 189 relatively stable , supporting its presence in the largely disordered ICD ( Figure 1 – figure 190 supplement 3 ) . Taken together , these in silico analyses suggest that while the ICD may contain 191 structural elements , it is likely disordered and does not possess a stable conformation in solution . 192 193 194 Kramer et al 9 195 Figure 1 .

Right , RMSD of the backbone of the HPO - 30 ICD over the course of the MD simulation , relative to the 223 starting structure . 224 225 226 Kramer et al 14 To experimentally validate the above computational analyses , we used circular dichroism 227 ( CD ) spectroscopy to evaluate HPO - 30 ICD secondary structure composition in solution . In 228 agreement with the MD simulations , the CD spectrum of ICD did not display major peaks at the 229 wavelengths characteristic of either alpha helices ( positive at 193 nm and negative at 218 and 230 222 nm ) or beta sheets ( positive at 195 nm and negative at 217 nm ) , clearly distinct from the CD 231 spectrum of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) obtained under the same conditions ( Figure 2A ) . 232 Adding an osmolyte , trimethylamine N - oxide ( TMAO ) , which is commonly used to promote 233 protein folding , did not significantly alter the CD spectrum or enhance the ICD - WRC interaction 234 ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A , B ) ( Baskakov et al . , 1999 ) . Yet careful examination of the 235 CD spectrum revealed that the ICD is different from unstructured proteins , which typically 236 exhibit a positive peak at 222 nm ( Hwang and Waite , 2012 ) . This suggests that the HPO - 30 ICD 237 might contain some structural elements , possibly a helical region , as reflected by the negative 238 peak at 222 nm . 239 Being unable to grow crystals of the ICD ( either by itself , attached to solubility tags , or 240 together with the WRC ) , we used solution nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy to 241 further investigate the structural features of the ICD . The 1 H - 15 N heteronuclear single quantum 242 coherence ( HSQC ) spectra of untagged 15 N - labeled ICD were well resolved , from which we 243 identified 50 distinct amide crosspeaks , out of the 51 expected ( Figure 2B ) . The narrow 1 H 244 chemical shift dispersion was consistent with our CD spectroscopy analysis and suggested that 245 the ICD is predominantly disordered in solution . Fusing the ICD to two different solubility tags , 246 including the monomeric 56 - a . a . tag GB1 ( B1 domain of Streptococcal protein G , commonly 247 used in NMR ) ( Zhou and Wagner , 2010 ) and the dimeric GST - tag , did not cause any significant 248 chemical shift changes to the ICD crosspeaks ( Figure 2C , Figure 2 – figure supplement 1D , E ) , 249 suggesting that solubility tags and dimerization do not promote ICD folding . Moreover , the 250 NMR spectra were nearly identical at different protein concentrations ( 50 – 700 µM ) and 251 temperatures ( 283 K – 298 K ) , suggesting that the ICD alone does not undergo concentration - 252 dependent structural changes ( data not shown ) . 253 While the 2D 1 H - 15 N NMR spectroscopy can provide an overall assessment of the degree 254 of structural disorder based on the magnitude of the 1 H chemical shift dispersion , a precise 255 characterization of secondary structure content requires measuring the chemical shifts values of 256 individual backbone nuclei . 13 C chemical shift values measured for carbons alpha are particularly 257 Kramer et al 15 strong indicators of secondary structure motifs . We therefore collected a set of conventional 3D 258 triple resonance experiments [ HNCA , HNCO , and HN ( CO ) CA ] and were able to assign the 259 backbone chemical shifts ( 1 H , 15 N , and 13 C ) of 41 out of 51 amino acids of the ICD ( Figure 2 – 260 figure supplement 1F ) . The overall measured 13 C a chemical shifts show little deviation ( < 1 261 ppm ) from idealized random coil chemical shifts ( Figure 2D ) ( Kjaergaard et al . , 2011 ; 262 Kjaergaard and Poulsen , 2011 ) , indicating that the ICD is predominantly disordered in solution , 263 consistent with the MD simulations , the CD data , and the initial assessment based on the 2D 264 NMR spectra . However , we observed small but consistent positive secondary Cα chemical shifts , 265 suggesting the presence of a transient ( ~ 25 - 30 % ) alpha - helical motif in the same region that was 266 predicted to form an alpha helix in many of the ab initio predictions ( Figure 2D ) . Although we 267 could not obtain adequate signals for Cß atoms , the chemical shift of CO was consistent with the 268 Cα chemical shift data , further confirming that the same region of the ICD contained ~ 25 - 30 % 269 helical motif ( Figure 2 – figure supplement 1G ) . 270 Together , our data suggest that the HPO - 30 ICD is predominantly disordered in solution , 271 although it does contain some local secondary structures that could potentially fold into different 272 conformations . The exact nature of these conformations is unclear , and it remains challenging to 273 determine whether the entire ICD binds to the WRC as an extended linear peptide or as a 274 compact folded structure . 275 276 277 Kramer et al 16 278 Figure 2 .

( G ) Secondary CO chemical shift showing the deviation from idealized random 292 coils of CO chemical shifts measured for HPO - 30 ICD . 293 294 Kramer et al 18 HPO - 30 ICD requires dimerization to bind WRC 295 During our investigation of the interaction between the HPO - 30 ICD and the WRC , we 296 noticed that GST - tagged ICD exhibited robust binding to WRC , whereas MBP ( maltose binding 297 protein ) - tagged ICD showed much weaker binding ( Figure 3A ) . Note that both constructs 298 contained extensive flexible linkers of at least 16 a . a . between the tag and the ICD to prevent 299 steric hindrance from the tag . Given that GST is a constitutive dimer while MBP is a monomer , 300 we hypothesized that efficient binding of the HPO - 30 ICD to WRC may require dimerization . 301 We explored a variety of strategies to test this hypothesis . We first developed a new 302 WRC construct in which a dual MBP - tag , ( MBP ) 2 , was tethered to the WRC . This ( MBP ) 2 - WRC 303 would allow us to immobilize the WRC on amylose beads to pull down different monomeric vs . 304 dimeric forms of HPO - 30 ICD . Out of three different designs of ( MBP ) 2 - WRC , only the one 305 with an ( MBP ) 2 tag tethered to the C - terminus of Abi2 through sortase - mediated protein ligation 306 ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) effectively pulled down GST - HPO - 30 ICD [ herein referred to as WRC : Abi2 - 307 ( MBP ) 2 , Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ] , while the other two versions substantially interfered 308 with the interaction . One construct , WRC : ( MBP ) 2 - HSPC300 , has an ( MBP ) 2 tag fused to the N - 309 terminus of HSPC300 [ which was previously used to immobilize the WRC and pull down 310 WIRS - containing proteins ( Chen et al . , 2014a ) ] ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B , lane 6 vs . 8 ) , 311 and the other , WRC : ( MBP ) 2 - Abi2 , has ( MBP ) 2 fused to the N - terminus of Abi2 ( Figure 3— 312 figure supplement 1A ) . Thus , it is possible the regions near the N - terminus of HSPC300 or 313 Abi2 are close to the HPO - 30 ICD binding surface ( but not the WIRS binding surface ) . 314 Using WRC : Abi2 - ( MBP ) 2 , we compared the binding of ICDs that carry various 315 monomeric vs . dimeric tags . We observed that the dimeric form of GB1 - ICD [ referred to as 316 GB1 - CC - ICD , in which we inserted a homo - dimeric coiled - coil sequence between GB1 and the 317 ICD ( O’Shea et al . , 1999 ) ] exhibited much stronger binding than the monomeric GB1 - ICD 318 ( Figure 3B ) . To rule out the possibility that the tag sequences , rather than dimerization , 319 influenced protein binding , we introduced chemically inducible dimerization ( CID ) tags , FKBP 320 and FRB , to the ICD ( with the GB1 tag at the N - terminus ) ( Banaszynski et al . , 2005 ) ( Figure 321 3C ) . In the presence of the dimerizing agent rapamycin , GB1 - FKBP - ICD and GB1 - FRB - ICD 322 could form a tight heterodimer , as confirmed by size exclusion chromatography in the presence 323 and absence of rapamycin ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C - E ) . Consistent with results from 324 the constitutive dimeric tags , the addition of rapamycin to dimerize GB1 - FKBP / FRB - ICD ( F / F - 325 Kramer et al 19 ICD for short hereafter ) clearly promoted the binding of HPO - 30 ICD ( Figure 3C , lanes 2 vs . 3 ) . 326 In fact , we observed robust binding of all dimeric constructs we tested , including GST - ICD , 327 ICD - GST , and DLC8 - ICD ( DLC8 is a constitutive dimer from the dynein light chain ) ( Wang et 328 al . , 2003 ) . In contrast , all monomeric constructs , including GB1 - ICD , sumo - ICD , and mEGFP - 329 ICD exhibited very weak , if any , binding ( Figure 3 – figure supplement 2A , B ) . 330 ICD binding relies on the dimerization tags to bring two copies of ICD in close 331 proximity , because a heterodimer containing only one copy of ICD ( formed by mixing GB1 - 332 FKBP - ICD with GB1 - FRB tag ) was unable to support binding ( Figure 3D , lane 5 - 6 ) . Similarly , 333 a heterodimer containing one WT ICD and one mutant ICD ( alanine ∆5 mutation in Figure 1 ) 334 had weakened binding ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2F ) . It is important to note that when 335 using the heterodimeric ICDs , we maintained the same total monomeric concentration of the WT 336 ICD between heterodimers and homodimers . Thus , the lack of binding from heterodimers was 337 due to the absence of the WT ICD dimer rather than a reduction in WT ICD concentration . 338 Various competition assays further support the observation that only dimeric form of the 339 ICD can effectively bind to WRC . For example , even when added in 5000 - fold excess , the 340 chemically synthesized HPO - 30 ICD peptide could not compete off GST - ICD binding ( Figure 341 3—figure supplement 2C ) . In contrast , both F / F - ICD and DLC8 - ICD binding to the WRC 342 could be effectively competed off by GST - ICD in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 3—figure 343 supplement 2D ) . Moreover , F / F - ICD was able to compete off GST - ICD binding to WRC only 344 in the presence of rapamycin , but not in its absence ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2E , lanes 4 345 and 5 ) . Taken together , our data strongly suggest that dimerization of the HPO - 30 ICD is critical 346 for its binding to the WRC . 347 348 Kramer et al 20 349 Figure 3 .

We hypothesized that dimeric tags 390 facilitate ICD dimerization , and only dimerized ICD can bind to WRC . To test this hypothesis , 391 we first examined whether the ICD could interact with another copy of ICD , which would 392 indicate the potential for ICD dimerization . Indeed , we found GST - ICD effectively pulled down 393 MBP - ICD , indicating self - interaction ( Figure 4A ) . This is consistent with our co - 394 immunoprecipitation assay , which showed that HA - tagged full - length HPO - 30 retained Myc - 395 tagged full - length HPO - 30 when co - expressed in Drosophila S2 cells ( Figure 4—figure 396 supplement 1B ) . The ICD - ICD interaction was readily disrupted by increased salt concentration 397 ( not shown ) or higher pH ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ) , suggesting that the interaction 398 likely involves electrostatic interactions . We further asked which region in the HPO - 30 ICD was 399 important for the ICD - ICD interaction . Using the same alanine scan mutants as in Figure 1A , we 400 found that mutations in various regions impaired the ICD - ICD interaction , especially the N - 401 terminal ( ∆1 and ∆2 ) and the central regions ( ∆5 , ∆6 , and ∆7 ) of the ICD ( Figure 4B ) . It is 402 remarkable that ∆5 , ∆6 , and ∆7 sequences are also crucial for binding to WRC ( Figure 1B ) , 403 suggesting that ICD dimerization is closely linked to the WRC interaction . 404 Due to technical challenges , we were unable to measure the binding affinity of the ICD - 405 ICD interaction using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2A ) . Our 406 structural predictions using AlphaFold Multimer ( AFM ) generated several different models , 407 depending on the context of the ICD sequence used ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3A , B ) 408 ( Evans et al . , 2022 ; Jumper et al . , 2021 ) . The isolated ICD was consistently predicted to form a 409 homodimer ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3A ) . In contrast , the full - length HPO - 30 was 410 predicted to form two distinct dimers , one mediated by the transmembrane helix 2 ( H2 ) and the 411 beta strand 4 ( b4 ) in the extracellular domain , and the other mediated by the transmembrane 412 helix 3 ( H3 ) and the first helix of the ICD ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3B ) . In both 413 conformations , the ICD was predicted to form a long helix , without the two beta strands 414 predicted for the monomeric ICD ( Figure 1A ; Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ; Figure 4— 415 figure supplement 3A ) . All - atom MD simulations conducted on the dimeric structural models 416 indicate that the dimer conformations are not stable over the course of 200 ns , suggesting that the 417 limited helical interface between the two ICDs is not sufficient to form a stable complex ( Figure 418 4—figure supplement 3C ) . 419 Kramer et al 26 In summary , our data suggest that HPO - 30 ICD requires dimerization to interact with the 420 WRC . However , before to binding the WRC , the dimerized ICD may not have a stable 421 quaternary structure . 422 423 424 Kramer et al 27 425 Figure 4 . HPO - 30 ICD can self - associate .

We wondered how HPO - 30 ICD binding could influence WRC activity in promoting 466 Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization ( Cooper et al . , 1983 ; Doolittle et al . , 2013a ; Kouyama and 467 Mihashi , 1981 ) . For this , we compared the effect of monomeric and dimeric ICD on WRC 468 activity using an optimized buffer in the pyrene - actin polymerization assay ( Figure 5—figure 469 supplement 1A ) . The chemically inducible dimerization FKBP / FRB - ICD constructs ( shown in 470 Figure 3C ) allowed us to directly compare the monomeric vs . dimeric ICD by switching 471 between DMSO and rapamycin , instead of using different tags ( Figure 3—supplement figure 472 1C , D ) . Importantly , rapamycin alone did not have any effect on actin polymerization ( Figure 473 5—figure supplement 1B ) , allowing us to focus on the effect of dimerizing HPO - 30 ICD . 474 Unexpectedly , we observed that HPO - 30 ICD strongly inhibits Rac1 - WRC - mediated actin 475 polymerization ( Figure 5A , blue vs . purple curves ) , with the dimerized ICD exhibiting a more 476 potent effect ( Figure 5A , solid vs . dashed curves ) . This effect was dose - dependent , with 10 µM 477 ICD having a stronger effect than 5 µM ICD ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1D ) . In contrast , 478 the dimerized FKBP / FRB tag at the highest concentration only had a mild effect ( Figure 5— 479 figure supplement 1D , grey curve ) . Importantly , the presence of ICD did not nonspecifically 480 quench pyrene fluorescence from either G - actin or F - actin ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ) . 481 Therefore , the observed inhibition was due to HPO - 30 ICD preventing actin polymerization . 482 Interestingly , we noticed that the ICD inhibited actin polymerization to a level lower than 483 the basal level of actin polymerization from Arp2 / 3 alone , indicating that the inhibitory effect 484 was likely not through WRC . This is supported by our observation that the ICD similarly 485 inhibited actin polymerization induced by the isolated , constitutively active WCA peptide , with 486 the dimerized ICD again showing more potent inhibition ( Figure 5B ) . In fact , the HPO - 30 ICD 487 was able to inhibit spontaneous actin polymerization in the absence of any activator , including 488 the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 5C , Figure 5—figure supplement 1E ) . Therefore , our data suggest 489 that the inhibitory effect of the ICD is likely a direct effect on actin , rather than through WRC , 490 Rac1 , WCA , or Arp2 / 3 . 491 The strong , WRC - independent inhibitory effect of the ICD on actin polymerization made 492 it difficult to directly examine how ICD binding influences WRC activity . To overcome this 493 Kramer et al 32 challenge , we reduced the ICD concentration to 1 µM to minimize its inhibitory effect . At this 494 concentration , we did not observe HPO - 30 ICD activating WRC alone ( Figure 5D ) . Previous 495 studies on the WIRS - containing ICD from the cell adhesion membrane protein protocadherin 10 496 ( PCDH10 ) found that the PCDH10 ICD itself could not activate WRC but could enhance WRC 497 activation induced by low concentrations of Rac1 ( Chen et al . , 2014a ) . We tested if HPO - 30 ICD 498 might act similarly to PCDH10 , enhancing activity when WRC is mildly activated by Rac1 . 499 Interestingly , in this condition , we found that 1 µM monomeric ICD slightly , but robustly , 500 increased Rac1 - WRC - mediated actin polymerization ( Figure 5E , dashed blue vs . solid light pink 501 curves ) . Since only dimerized ICD can readily bind WRC , we speculated that the enhanced 502 activity was due to a small fraction of dimeric ICD existing in equilibrium with the monomeric 503 form ( Figure 4 , Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . To test this hypothesis ( while avoiding the 504 dominant inhibitory effect of rapamycin - dimerized ICD observed even at 1 µM , Figure 5E , solid 505 blue curve ) , we reduced the dimerized ICD concentration to 0 . 1 µM . Consistent with our 506 hypothesis , at this low concentration , the dimerized ICD similarly promoted Rac1 - WRC - 507 medicated actin polymerization ( Figure 5E , solid green curve ) . This activating effect was 508 specific to Rac1 - activated WRC , as free WCA could not be further activated by dimerized ICD 509 ( Figure 5F ) . Although we could not test higher concentrations of ICD due to its strong inhibitory 510 effect on actin polymerization , low concentrations of dimeric ICD could enhance Rac1 - WRC 511 activity , suggesting ICD binding cooperates with Rac1 to promote WRC activation . 512 The cooperativity between Rac1 and the HPO - 30 ICD in activating WRC suggests that 513 the ICD has a preference for binding to activated WRC . Supporting this hypothesis , our 514 equilibrium pull - down ( EPD ) assay showed that GST - ICD pulled down more WRC in the 515 presence of saturating concentrations of Rac1 ( which was manifested by less WRC remaining in 516 the pull - down supernatant , Figure 5— figure supplement 1G , lane 2 vs . 4 ) ( Yang et al . , 2022 ) . 517 Taken together , our data demonstrate that , while the HPO - 30 ICD cannot activate the WRC by 518 itself , it can synergistically cooperate with Rac1 to promote WRC activation , similar to the 519 WIRS receptor PCDH10 ( Chen et al . , 2014a ) . Our unexpected finding that the HPO - 30 ICD 520 strongly inhibits actin polymerization suggests that the ICD directly interacts with actin . 521 522 Kramer et al 33 523 Figure 5 .

However , we could not detect binding 554 between GST - ICD or dimerized F / F - ICD and G - actin ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A , B ) . 555 We next wondered if the ICD inhibited actin polymerization by binding to F - actin . In our F - actin 556 co - pelleting assay ( Heier et al . , 2017 ) , we found that , compared to BSA , F / F tag , or the capping 557 protein CapZ ( which only binds to the barbed ends of F - actin ) , F / F - ICD more robustly bound to 558 F - actin ( Figure 6A , B ) . Interestingly , both the monomeric and dimeric F / F - ICD showed 559 significant binding to F - actin ( Figure 6A , B , blue , + DMSO vs . + Rap ) , although the dimeric ICD 560 showed significantly stronger binding . This suggests that the monomeric ICD , while not as 561 effective in inhibiting actin polymerization as the dimeric form , is also capable of binding to 562 actin filaments . An equilibrium actin pelleting assay suggested a K D of ~ 1 . 69 µM for the binding 563 between the dimerized ICD and F - actin ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1C ) ( Avery et al . , 2017 ) . 564 To identify the critical region ( s ) of the ICD required for its interaction with actin 565 filaments , we introduced the same alanine scan mutations used in Figure 1 into both SNAP - 566 tagged FKBP - ICD and FRB - ICD constructs , which we used for all subsequent actin - related 567 experiments . Interestingly , we found that the same regions crucial for ICD’s interaction with the 568 WRC ( Figure 1B ) and with itself ( Figure 4B , C ) , including ∆1 , ∆5 , ∆6 , and ∆7 , were also the 569 most essential for binding to F - actin ( Figure 6— figure supplement 1D , E ) . 570 The above data strongly suggest that the HPO - 30 ICD inhibits actin polymerization by 571 directly binding to F - actin . Proteins with similar activity include capping proteins , such as CapZ . 572 Capping proteins bind to the barbed end of actin filaments to impede both actin polymerization 573 and depolymerization from the barbed end ( Caldwell et al . , 1989 ; Weeds and Maciver , 1993 ) . To 574 test whether the HPO - 30 ICD may function as a capping protein , we used a depolymerization 575 assay that is commonly utilized to measure CapZ activity ( Caldwell et al . , 1989 ; Cooper and 576 Pollard , 1985 ) . We found that the ICD , like CapZ , inhibited actin depolymerization ( Figure 577 6C , D ) . This inhibitory activity was both concentration - and dimerization - dependent , suggesting 578 that dimerization is critical for this capping - like activity . This aligns with our observation that 579 dimeric ICD more potently inhibited actin polymerization than monomeric ICD ( Figure 5 , 580 Figure 5 – figure supplement 1E ) . To determine which region ( s ) of the ICD are important for 581 this capping - like activity , we tested the same alanine scan mutations used in Figure 1 and Figure 582 Kramer et al 37 6 – figure supplement 1D , E . As anticipated , the regions most critical for the depolymerization 583 activity of the ICD were the same as those crucial for binding to actin filaments ( Figure 6 – 584 figure supplement 1F - G ) . Collectively , our results suggest that the HPO - 30 ICD behaves 585 analogously to capping proteins in obstructing both depolymerization and polymerization of F - 586 actin ( Figure 5 , Figure 6 ) . 587 588 589 Kramer et al 38 590 Figure 6 .

This suggests that the HPO - 30 ICD may 626 have two distinct activities on actin filaments , with only the dimerization - dependent activity 627 resembling that of CapZ . This hypothesis could explain why more ICD co - pelleted with F - actin 628 than CapZ did ( Figure 6A , B ) , as CapZ only binds to the barbed end of actin filaments ( albeit 629 with high affinity ) ( Caldwell et al . , 1989 ) , while the ICD may bind to both the barbed end ( in a 630 dimerization - dependent manner ) and other surfaces of the actin filaments ( in a dimerization - 631 independent manner ) . 632 To understand how the HPO - 30 ICD binds F - actin , we used single - molecule total internal 633 reflection fluorescence ( smTIRF ) microscopy to directly visualize the interaction . For this assay , 634 we first attached a SNAP tag to the N - terminus of various FKBP / FRB constructs or the CapZ b - 635 subunit , and then labeled the SNAP tag using different SNAP - Surface® AlexaFluor® dyes 636 ( hereafter referred to as AF followed by the corresponding excitation wavelength ) . Actin was 637 directly labeled with AF647 using previously established methods ( Hansen et al . , 2013 ) . We 638 verified that the SNAP - tagged F / F - ICDs bound to the WRC in a rapamycin - dependent manner 639 and to a level similar to the GB1 - tagged F / F - ICD , suggesting that the SNAP tag did not affect 640 ICD function ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1A , lane 1 - 4 ) . The labeled CapZ and F / F - ICD 641 proteins exhibited capping activity comparable to their counterparts used in bulk solution assays 642 ( except for the AF647 - labeled F / F - ICD , which was subsequently excluded from smTIRF assays 643 described below ) ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1B , C ) . 644 In the smTIRF experiments , SNAP AF488 - CapZ ( at 5 nM ) was found to stably bind to the 645 barbed end of filaments , and the binding stopped filament growth ( Figure 7A top ; 7C green ; 646 Video 1 , 2 ) , consistent with the high affinity and very slow off - rate of CapZ at the barbed end 647 shown in previous studies ( Caldwell et al . , 1989 ) . In contrast , SNAP AF546 - F / F - ICD ( 15 nM , with 648 8 - fold molar excess of rapamycin ) mainly bound to the side of actin filaments , instead of the 649 barbed end ( Figure 7A bottom ; 7B ; Video 3 - 4 ) ( see below ) . While we occasionally observed an 650 ICD appearing to bind to the barbed end of a filament ( see Figure 7A bottom for an example , at 651 time 39 . 0 s ) , the filament continued to grow beyond the bound ICD , leaving the ICD bound to 652 the same location on the filament . We could conclude that the ICD molecule bound to the 653 Kramer et al 42 filament and not the PEG - coated surface , because it moved together with the filament ( Video 654 3 , 4 ) . By using stringent criteria to prevent misidentification of nonspecific background signals as 655 binding events , we found that 33 % of filaments had at least one binding event for SNAP - F / F - 656 ICD over the 15 - minute duration of the experiment , which was significantly higher than the 657 number of events for the SNAP - F / F tag under identical conditions ( Figure 6B ) . 658 We found it difficult to increase the concentration of fluorescently labeled ICD to 659 observe more barbed end binding events , as this resulted in high background in smTIRF 660 experiments . Therefore , we used higher concentrations of unlabeled ICD to see if it could inhibit 661 actin filament growth as shown in the bulk solution assays in Figure 6C , D ( Figure 7C ; Video 5 ) . 662 We found that 1 µM dimerized F / F - ICD significantly decreased the actin elongation rate from 663 2 . 3 ± 0 . 5 subunits / sec to 1 . 5 ± 0 . 3 subunits / sec ( Kuhn and Pollard , 2005 ) ( Figure 7C , black vs . 664 solid blue ) . The same concentration of monomeric F / F - ICD also slowed down actin elongation , 665 but to a lesser extent ( 2 . 0 ± 0 . 4 subunits / sec ) ( Figure 7C , open blue ) . This could be due to either 666 the side - binding activity of ICD or the presence of dimeric ICD in equilibrium with monomeric 667 ICD , which could bind to the barbed end . Importantly , dimerized F / F tag did not significantly 668 affect actin polymerization ( 2 . 1 ± 0 . 4 subunits / sec ) ( Figure 7C , grey ) . Unfortunately , we could 669 not increase the unlabeled ICD concentration further to observe stronger inhibitory effects due to 670 limitations in the volume of high - concentration protein stock that we could add to the microfluid 671 chamber . In contrast , CapZ strongly inhibited actin polymerization , even at 5 nM ( 0 . 3 ± 0 . 1 672 subunits / sec ) . Further examination of the kymographs of individual actin filaments revealed that 673 in the absence of ICD or CapZ , filaments typically grew at a uniform rate . In the presence of 674 dimeric F / F - ICD , filaments grew more slowly and with occasional pausing ( Figure 7E ; Figure 7 675 – figure supplement 2A , B ) . In the presence of CapZ , filaments exhibited almost no growth most 676 of the time over the course of the video ( Figure 7E ; Figure 7 – figure supplement 2C ) . Taken 677 together , our data suggest that HPO - 30 ICD and CapZ have similar inhibitory effects on actin 678 filament elongation , although at the same concentration , the ICD exhibits less potent activity . 679 In the above smTIRF experiments , we encountered several technical challenges that 680 prevented us from observing stable binding of the ICD to the barbed end , in contrast to the stable 681 binding observed with CapZ . These challenges include : limited concentrations of fluorophore - 682 labeled ICD ( nM , instead of µM that we could use in bulk solution assays ) , potential low affinity 683 and fast off - rate of the ICD binding to the barbed end , difficulty in distinguishing barbed end 684 Kramer et al 43 binding from side binding due to light diffraction limit , lower than expected concentration of 685 dimeric ICD [ the dissociation constant of FKBP - rapamycin binding to FRB is ~ 12 nM 686 ( Banaszynski et al . , 2005 ) ] , and fast binding / dissociation events potentially beyond the data 687 acquisition speed ( 50 or 100 ms exposure time ) . To further investigate whether the ICD binds to 688 the barbed end , we used a competition co - pelleting assay to determine if dimeric F / F - ICD could 689 compete with CapZ for binding to the barbed end of F - actin ( Figure 7D ) . Our results showed 690 that the dimerized F / F - ICD , when applied at about ten times the concentration of CapZ , 691 significantly decreased CapZ binding by ~ 60 % . In contrast , neither the monomeric F / F - ICD nor 692 the dimerized F / F tag had an impact on CapZ binding ( Figure 7D ) . This result suggests that 693 dimeric ICD binds to the barbed end and can block CapZ binding , consistent with our findings 694 that dimeric ICD is more effective in inhibiting actin polymerization ( Figure 5A , B ) and 695 depolymerization ( Figure 6C , D ) . 696 Combining our single molecule and bulk solution results , we conclude that HPO - 30 ICD 697 monomers preferentially bind to the side of actin filaments , while dimers can bind to both the 698 sides and the barbed end of filaments . Only the barbed end binding by dimeric ICD can inhibit 699 actin filament growth in a manner similar to CapZ . These findings reveal a surprising function of 700 the HPO - 30 ICD in directly regulating actin cytoskeletal remodeling . 701 Kramer et al 44 702 Figure 7 .

For example , in the top row , the filament and SNAP AF488 - CapZ puncta were displaced at 69 . 5 s , but 707 aligned again at 70 . 5 s . The lagging was due to image acquisition conditions , where , to prevent photobleaching 708 of AF647 , images in the 640 nm - channel for actin AF647 were taken every 20 acquisitions of the 488 nm - channel 709 for SNAP AF488 - CapZ ( see Materials and Methods ) .

Right , kymographs of the filaments displayed on the left . 736 737 Kramer et al 48 Discussion 738 HPO - 30 is a claudin - like membrane protein with a crucial role in higher order dendrite 739 branching in C . elegans PVD neurons ( Smith et al . , 2013 ; Tang et al . , 2019 ; Zou et al . , 2018 , 740 2015 ) . At branching sites , HPO - 30 forms a co - receptor with the cell - adhesion transmembrane 741 protein DMA - 1 , which together transduce extracellular signals ( from the epidermal proteins 742 SAX - 7 , MNR - 1 , and muscle secreted LECT - 2 ) to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton ( Figure 8 , 743 left ) . Previous studies showed that this process required the HPO - 30 intracellular domain ( ICD ) 744 to bind to the WRC , which in turn could activate Arp2 / 3 to generate branched actin networks to 745 deform the membrane and promote new dendrite formation ( Zou et al . , 2018 ) . In this study , our 746 multifaceted analyses reveal two novel mechanisms employed by the HPO - 30 ICD to regulate 747 local actin dynamics . First , the ICD undergoes dimerization to bind the WRC , which , in addition 748 to recruiting the WRC to local dendrite branching sites , can cooperate with Rac1 to enhance 749 WRC activation ( Figure 8 , step 2 ) . This mechanism can work synergistically with DMA - 1 , as 750 the cytoplasmic tail of DMA - 1 directly recruits the Rac - GEF , TIAM1 , which would increase the 751 local concentration of active GTP - Rac1 ( Zou et al . , 2018 ) . Second , the HPO - 30 ICD directly 752 binds to actin filaments to modulate actin dynamics , with monomeric and dimeric forms binding 753 to the side of filaments , and the dimeric ICD alone binding to the barbed end to inhibit both actin 754 polymerization and depolymerization , similar to CapZ activity ( Figure 8 , step 1 and 2 ) . These 755 seemingly contradictory actin regulatory mechanisms may enable exquisite control of local actin 756 dynamics necessary for dendrite branching ( Figure 8 , right , and see discussion below ) . 757 HPO - 30 presents a unique example of a transmembrane protein capable of interacting 758 with the WRC , distinct from the previously identified WIRS peptide - containing receptors such 759 as SYG - 1 , Robo , DCC , Neogenin , TMEM132 , neuroligins , and various protocadherins 760 ( Chaudhari et al . , 2021 ; Chia et al . , 2014 ; Fan et al . , 2018 ; Lee et al . , 2016 ; Wang et al . , 2021 ; 761 Xing et al . , 2018 ) . Unlike these receptors , the HPO - 30 ICD does not use a WIRS motif or a 762 similar short peptide motif to bind WRC . Instead , our structure - function analyses show that the 763 entire ICD sequence is necessary for binding to the WRC , and dimerization of the ICD is crucial 764 for this interaction . This novel WRC - binding mechanism should be conserved across animals , as 765 the HPO - 30 ICD is present only in nematodes but can bind to both C . elegans and human WRCs 766 ( Zou et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , HPO - 30 represents a new class of transmembrane proteins that interact 767 Kramer et al 49 with the WRC using a distinct mechanism from the WIRS - containing receptors identified 768 previously ( Chen et al . , 2014a ) . 769 Without a high - resolution structure of the ICD complexed with WRC , the exact 770 conformation that the ICD adopts and how dimerization mediates WRC binding remain to be 771 determined . Our computational and biophysical analyses consistently indicate that the 772 monomeric ICD contains transient helical structure , but it is overall predominantly disordered in 773 solution . Two possible mechanisms could explain how the ICD binds to WRC and why 774 dimerization appears important for the interaction . In the first mechanism , the ICD may have one 775 binding surface on the WRC . The dimerized ICD acts as one structural entity , which undergoes 776 induced folding and adopts a stable conformation to bind the WRC . Induced folding has been 777 proposed for many DNA - binding proteins and cell - signaling molecules , such as the interaction 778 between E - cadherin and ß - catenin or between Tg IST and STAT1 ( Dyson and Wright , 2002 ; 779 Huang et al . , 2022 ; Huber et al . , 2001 ; Huber and Weis , 2001 ; Turjanski et al . , 2008 ) . In the 780 second mechanism , the ICD may have two separate binding surfaces on the WRC . Dimerization 781 tags attached to the ICD provide an avidity effect that promotes simultaneous binding of two 782 copies of ICD to the two surfaces on the same WRC . Because ICD can directly bind to another 783 ICD , we favor the first mechanism , but our data cannot rule out the second mechanism . The 784 above two mechanisms can also explain how the ICD binds to the barbed end of actin filaments 785 in a dimerization - dependent manner . Regardless of which mechanism is used , it is likely the ICD 786 adopts two distinct conformations when binding to WRC vs . binding to the barbed end of F - 787 actin . Such structural plasticity has been observed for signaling molecules with versatile 788 functions ( Bürgi et al . , 2016 ; Dishman and Volkman , 2018 ; Okuda et al . , 2022 ) . Resolving the 789 high - resolution structures and identifying the key residues responsible for each binding event 790 would allow us to differentiate the two functions of HPO - 30 ICD more precisely . 791 The requirement of ICD dimerization for both WRC - binding and F - actin capping 792 suggests an intriguing mechanism of how HPO - 30 regulates actin remodeling at dendrite 793 branching sites . Clustering of membrane receptors is a common mechanism to increase local 794 signaling molecule concentration ( Johannes et al . , 2018 ) . The enrichment of HPO - 30 at 795 developing PVD neuron dendrites correlates with the high level of F - actin in these branches ( Zou 796 et al . , 2018 ) . In addition to increasing its local membrane density , clustering of HPO - 30 may 797 facilitate dimerization of its ICD , which can in turn activate its ability to recruit the WRC and 798 Kramer et al 50 cap actin filaments . This dimerization - mediated functional switch can help the cell to distinguish 799 signal from noise and achieve sharp spatiotemporal control of actin polymerization in response 800 to upstream stimuli . It is worth noting that the regions of the ICD that most dramatically affect its 801 ability to interact with another ICD are the same regions that are most important for binding to 802 WRC and binding / capping F - actin . This again support the idea that dimerization ( or 803 oligomerization ) is key to ICD function . 804 Our study indicates that the HPO - 30 ICD has two functions upon binding to the WRC : 1 ) 805 recruiting the WRC to dendrite branching site membranes and 2 ) enhancing WRC activation by 806 Rac1 . This dual action of binding and sensitizing the WRC has been observed in several WIRS - 807 containing receptors , such as PCDH10 and PCDH19 , where WIRS peptide binding recruits the 808 receptor to the membrane while weak interactions from the flanking ICD sequences promote 809 WRC activation by Rac1 ( Chen et al . , 2014a ) . Since the HPO - 30 ICD strongly inhibits actin 810 polymerization , it will be important to develop new assays to directly measure WRC activation , 811 such as tracking WCA release , to understand how HPO - 30 ICD binding enhances WRC 812 activation by Rac1 . As Rac1 activates the WRC by binding to two distinct sites located on the 813 Sra1 subunit ( Chen et al . , 2017 ; Ding et al . , 2022a ) , it is possible that HPO - 30 ICD promotes 814 Rac1 - WRC activation by directly stabilizing Rac1 binding to either site or by destabilizing WCA 815 sequestration . 816 To our knowledge , HPO - 30 represents the first transmembrane protein that possesses 817 actin capping ( or capping - like ) activity . The precise structural mechanism of how the dimeric 818 HPO - 30 ICD binds to the barbed end of actin filaments remains to be determined . It is possible 819 that it binds to the same surface as CapZ . Alternatively , it might bind to a nearby surface that 820 could either sterically clash with or allosterically destabilize CapZ binding . Regardless , the dual 821 abilities of HPO - 30 to promote WRC membrane recruitment and activation while also capping 822 actin filaments and inhibiting actin polymerization may seem contradictory at first glance . 823 However , capping activity , which is usually provided by cytosolic capping proteins like CapZ , is 824 known to be critical for Arp2 / 3 - based actin dynamics in both bead motility assays in vitro and 825 many processes in vivo ( Akin and Mullins , 2008 ; Miyoshi et al . , 2006 ) . Capping proteins can 826 stop long actin filament growth and simultaneously reserve G - actin by blocking its access to 827 barbed ends ( Carlier and Pantaloni , 1997 ) . In parallel , capping protein can also prevent the 828 barbed end from sequestering the WH2 sequence of WCA , which would otherwise deplete the 829 Kramer et al 51 activity of WASP - family proteins ( Co et al . , 2007 ; Higgs et al . , 1999 ) . Together , by blocking the 830 barbed end , the capping activity stimulates the formation of new branches through Arp2 / 3 and 831 thus plays a crucial role in dynamically modulating the actin architecture to generate force 832 against the surface where actin is localized ( Akin and Mullins , 2008 ; Funk et al . , 2021 ) ( Figure 833 8 , step 2 ) . In principle , the capping activity of the HPO - 30 ICD should act similarly to stimulate 834 the formation of a highly branched actin network . Although the isolated ICD has apparently 835 lower capping activity compared to the canonical capping protein CapZ , it has the advantage of 836 concentrating the capping activity in the area immediately next to membranes , which can provide 837 a more focused control of actin dynamics . 838 In summary , our study establishes HPO - 30 as a novel membrane receptor that , upon 839 dimerization , can directly integrate the activities of WRC - Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization 840 and actin filament capping , distinguishing it from other WIRS - containing receptors and 841 canonical barbed end cappers like CapZ . These two distinct functions of HPO - 30 provide an 842 intriguing model to explain how it regulates local actin dynamics to facilitate dendrite branching 843 in PVD neurons ( Figure 8 ) . The synergistic action of both functions would promote the 844 formation of highly branched actin networks , which help generate dendritic “swellings” observed 845 in PVD neurons immediately before dendrite branch outgrowth ( Figure 8 , step 3 ) ( Shi et al . , 846 2021 ) . This mechanism likely works in conjunction with other actin machinery in the cell to 847 achieve highly spatiotemporally controlled actin dynamics and neuronal cell branching . 848 849 Kramer et al 52 850 Figure 8 . HPO - 30 ICD integrates two distinct mechanisms to regulate actin dynamics during dendrite 851 branching . Left , in C . elegans PVD neurons , a variety of molecules work together with the HPO - 30 / DMA - 1 co - 852 receptor to link extracellular signals to the intracellular actin network critical for driving dendrite branching . Right , 853 model of how HPO - 30 ICD modulates actin dynamics . In ( 1 ) , HPO - 30 on the dendrite membrane undergoes 854 dimerization ( or oligomerization ) . Both monomeric and dimeric forms of HPO - 30 ICD can bind to the side of actin 855 filaments , but only the dimeric ICD can bind to the fast - growing barbed end . In ( 2 ) , dimeric ICD binding to the 856 barbed end acts as a capping protein , which stops long filament growth and helps reserve G - actin for the Arp2 / 3 857 complex to produce short , branched actin filaments . In ( 2 ) , dimeric ICD can also interact with the WRC . This 858 recruits the WRC to the membrane and simultaneously promotes WRC activation by Rac1 , which in turn stimulates 859 Arp2 / 3 to produce branched actin filaments . In ( 3 ) , the dual actions of HPO - 30 ICD facilitate the formation of 860 branched actin networks , which can help generate the “swelling” of dendrite observed in previous studies ( Shi et al . , 861 2021 ) , an important indicator of the outgrowth of a new dendrite branch . 862 Kramer et al 53 Materials and Methods 863 Protein expression and purification 864 See Supplementary File 1 for amino acid sequences of recombinant proteins used in this 865 study .

The Sra1 / Nap1 dimer was 904 obtained by co - expressing His6 - Sra1 and untagged Nap1 in Tni insect cells ( Expression 905 Systems ) , followed by purification through Ni - NTA agarose resin ( Qiagen ) and anion exchange 906 chromatography using a Source 15Q column at pH 8 . 0 . Pentameric WRC was assembled and 907 purified following previously described protocols ( Chen et al . , 2014b , 2010 ) . Briefly , 908 individually purified WAVE1 , Abi2 , and HSPC300 subunits were mixed at equimolar ratio in 909 the presence of 1 % ( w / v ) NP40 and incubated on ice for 48 hours . The assembled trimer was 910 then purified by anion exchange chromatography through a Source 15Q column at pH 8 . 0 and 911 cation exchange chromatography by a Source 15S column at pH 6 . 0 .

The pentamer was further purified using anion exchange chromatography 915 through a Source 15Q column at pH 8 . 0 and size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 916 200 column . 917 Actin was purified as previously described from rabbit muscle acetone powder from Pel - 918 Freeze ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) . Actin was labeled by pyrene or Alexa Fluor ® 647 after 919 polymerization at 4 °C , using a 10 - fold or 2 - fold excess dye , respectively . Actin and pyrene - 920 labeled actin used in actin polymerization and depolymerization assays were kept in continuous 921 dialysis at 4 °C , with buffer changes twice a week . Actin and Alexa Fluor ® 647 - labeled actin 922 used in smTIRF experiments were kept at 4 °C away from light for up to two weeks . 923 924 Kramer et al 55 Generation of WRC - ( MBP ) 2 925 To create WRC : Abi2 - ( MBP ) 2 , the sortase ligation sequence , LPGTG , was genetically 926 fused to the C - terminus of MBP - Abi2 ( 1 - 158 ) . Meanwhile , a TEV site was added to the N - 927 terminus of an ( MBP ) 2 tag , which after Tev cleavage would expose a Gly required for sortase 928 ligation . MBP - Abi2 ( 1 - 158 ) - LPGTG was expressed , purified , and incorporated into the WRC as 929 described above to create WRC - LPGTG . GG - 2MBP was expressed in Arctic Express ( DE3 ) RIL 930 ( Agilent ) cells after induction with 0 . 75 mM IPTG at 10 °C for 16 hours , purified on amylose 931 resin , and subjected to TEV cleavage overnight , followed by anion exchange chromatography 932 using a Source 15Q column ( GE Healthcare ) . Sortase5M ( sortase A pentamutant ) was a gift from 933 David Liu ( Addgene plasmid # 75144 ) , expressed in Arctic Express ( DE3 ) RIL ( Agilent ) cells , 934 purified over Ni - NTA agarose resin , followed by cation exchange using a Source 15S column 935 ( GE Healthcare ) and size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 column ( GE 936 Healthcare ) ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) . WRC - LPGTG ( 1 µM ) was mixed with GG - MBP ( 25 µM ) and 937 sortase ( 10 µM ) in 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , and 10 mM CaCl 2 and left at room 938 temperature for two hours . The reaction was quenched by adding 25 mM EGTA , and the WRC - 939 ( MBP ) 2 was purified over a Superdex 200 column to separate the WRC - ( MBP ) 2 from unligated 940 molecules and sortase . 941 942 Regular pull - down assay 943 GST pull - down assays were performed as previously described ( Shi et al . , 2021 ) . Briefly , 944 20 µL of GSH - Sepharose beads were mixed with bait protein and prey protein in 1 mL of pull - 945 down buffer ( 50 mM NaCl , 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 0 , 5 % ( w / v ) glycerol , 5 mM 2 - 946 mercaptoethanol , and 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 ) . For reactions at alternative pH values , either 10 mM 947 MES pH 6 . 0 or 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 was used in place of HEPES . The samples were mixed at 4 948 °C for 30 minutes , washed three times with 1 mL of pull - down buffer , and eluted with 40 µL of 949 elution buffer containing 30 mM reduced glutathione and 100 mM Tris pH 8 . 5 . MBP pull - down 950 assays were performed like GST pull - down assays , except that 20 µL of amylose resin was used , 951 and elution buffer included 2 % ( w / v ) maltose . His - tagged pull - down assays were performed as 952 above , used 20 µL of Ni - NTA agarose resin , G - Buffer ( 2 mM Tris HCl pH 8 . 0 , 200 µM ATP , 953 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM CalCl 2 , and 1mM NaN 3 ) as the wash buffer . The elution buffer contained 954 500 mM imidazole pH 7 . 0 . In all pull - down assays , the eluate was examined by SDS - PAGE and 955 Kramer et al 56 Coomassie blue staining . In all pull - down assays using FKBP and FRB , rapamycin was added to 956 5 µM final concentration in all buffers . In control reactions , the same volume of DMSO was 957 added in place of rapamycin . 958 For the WRC alanine scan pull - down quantification ( Figure 1B ) , the intensity of the Sra1 959 and Nap1 bands were quantified using ImageJ . The intensity from the GST control lane was 960 subtracted from the alanine protein lane , and the corrected intensity was divided by the intensity 961 of the GST - ICD band . This ratio was then divided by the ratio of the wild type HPO - 30 lane . For 962 the MBP - ICD alanine scan pull - down quantification ( Figure 4A ) , the intensity of the MBP - ICD 963 band was quantified using ImageJ and divided by the intensity of the GST - ICD band . The ratio 964 of the GST control was then subtracted from the ICD ratio . The corrected ratio was then set 965 relative to the WT ICD lane . For both the WRC and MBP - ICD alanine scan pulldowns , ANOVA 966 on Ranks and Dunn - Tukey tests were performed to determine significance . 967 968 Equilibrium pull - down ( EPD ) assay 969 Equilibrium pull - down assays were performed as previously described ( Chen et al . , 970 2017 ) . Briefly , 60 µL of GSH - Sepharose beads ( 50 % slurry equilibrated in pull - down buffer ) 971 were mixed with 0 . 1 µM WRC and various amounts of GST - tagged protein ( from 0 . 01 µM to 30 972 µM ) and brought to 100 µL final reaction volume using pull - down buffer ( composition the same 973 as in GST pull - down assays , above ) . The reactions were allowed to mix for 30 min at 4 °C , and 974 four reactions at a time were spun at 15 krpm for 15 seconds . The supernatant was removed and 975 examined by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie blue staining . Each assay was repeated 3 times . The 976 Sra1 / Nap1 intensity was quantified using ImageJ to calculate the fractional occupancy . The data 977 from all repeats were pooled and globally fitted in DynaFit using a single binding site model 978 ( Kuzmic , 1996 ) . 979 980 Size exclusion chromatography analysis 981 GB1 - FKBP - ICD and GB1 - FRB - ICD were mixed at equimolar ratio and loaded onto a 982 24 - mL Superdex 200 column ( GE healthcare ) equilibrated in 100 mM NaCl , 10 mM HEPES pH 983 7 . 0 , 5 % ( w / v ) glycerol , and 1 mM DTT , with or without 5 µM rapamycin . Molecular weight was 984 determined by running molecular weight standards ( Sigma Cat # MWGF200 - 1KT ) in identical 985 buffer as the ICD proteins and generating a standard curve from the elution volumes . 986 Kramer et al 57 987 Pyrene - actin polymerization assay 988 Pyrene - actin polymerization assays were performed as previously described ( Doolittle et 989 al . , 2013a ) . Actin was purified and pyrene - labeled as described above and kept in continuous 990 dialysis in G - Buffer ( 2 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM 991 NaN 3 ) that was changed twice a week . Arp2 / 3 was purified following existing protocols and kept 992 aliquoted at - 80°C ( Doolittle et al . , 2013b ) . All proteins except for the WRC and Arp2 / 3 were 993 purified into 50KMEH5Gd ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 0 , 994 5 % [ w / v ] glycerol , 1 mM DTT ) and stored at - 80°C . WRC230VCA was purified into 995 100KMEI20Gd ( 100 mM KCl , 10 mM Imidazole pH 7 . 0 , 20 % [ w / v ] glycerol ) and kept at - 80°C . 996 Unless otherwise noted , a typical reaction contained 2 µM actin with 10 % pyrene labeled , 10 nM 997 Arp2 / 3 , 100 nM WRC 230WCA or free WCA , and / or 0 . 4 µM Rac1 QP ∆4 , and / or additional ICD 998 ligands to be analyzed , with or without 5 µM rapamycin or an equivalent volume of DMSO . For 999 reactions in Figure 5C , reactions contained 4 µM actin with 5 % pyrene labeling , with 5 µM 1000 rapamycin . The excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 365 nm and 407 nm , 1001 respectively , and data was collected every 2 seconds for 30 minutes . Pyrene quenching assays 1002 ( Figure 5 – figure supplement 1C ) were performed by mixing 4 µM actin with 5 % pyrene 1003 labeling , either in the monomeric state or pre - polymerized by the addition of 50KMEH5Gd , with 1004 ICD and monitoring fluorescence over time . The long - term actin assays ( Figure 5 – figure 1005 supplement 1 E ) were assembled the same as for Figure 5C , but data was collected every two 1006 minutes over the course of 16 hours . The polymerization rate at t 1 / 2 was obtained by programs at 1007 https : / / biochempy . bb . iastate . edu / , which uses the same algorithm as described in ( Padrick et al . , 1008 2008 ) . Data were collected on a TECAN SPARK plate reader . 1009 1010 Actin depolymerization assay 1011 Actin depolymerization assays were performed as previously described , with some 1012 modifications ( Heiss and Cooper , 1991 ) . Actin at ~ 20 µM and 70 % pyrene - labeling was pre - 1013 polymerized at room temperature overnight by addition of 1 mM MgCl 2 and 50 mM KCl . For 1014 each depolymerization reaction , actin was diluted to 5 µM in one pooled mixture , either alone or 1015 with proteins to be tested , and left for 3 minutes at room temperature to allow for protein 1016 binding . Protein at the same concentration was prepared in a second , separate mixture . After 3 1017 Kramer et al 58 minutes , the actin was further diluted 20 - fold by the addition of the second mixture . All proteins 1018 were diluted into depolymerization buffer , which is 3 parts G - Buffer and 1 part 50KMEH5Gd 1019 ( see above for buffer composition ) . The excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 365 nm 1020 and 407 nm , respectively . Data were collected on a TECAN SPARK plate reader . To calculate 1021 the relative initial velocity , the slope for the first 30 seconds of the reaction was calculated and 1022 divided by the slope of the actin control . ANOVA on Ranks and Dunn - Tukey tests were 1023 performed to determine significance . 1024 1025 Circular dichroism ( CD ) measurement 1026 Untagged HPO - 30 ICD was purified into 100 mM NaCl , 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 0 , 5 % 1027 ( w / v ) glycerol , and 1 mM DTT . The same buffer was used to dissolve BSA powder ( Fisher Cat # 1028 BP1600 - 100 ) and to blank the CD spectrometer . The blank buffer was degassed by sonication 1029 for 3 minutes at 30 % power . Data were collected on a MOS - 500 circular dichroism spectrometer 1030 using an ALX250 lamp . Data were collected for wavelengths between 190 nm and 260 nm , with 1031 a 1 nm step , 0 . 5 s acquisition period , and averaged over three repeats . Mean residue ellipticity 1032 was calculated as described previously ( Greenfield , 2006 ) . Data for BSA and HPO - 30 were 1033 collected at the same concentration of protein . TMAO was dissolved to 3 M in the same buffer as 1034 HPO - 30 and was added to the appropriate concentration before measurement . Separate buffer 1035 blanks containing the same concentration of TMAO were measured to ensure TMAO alone did 1036 not contribute to the spectrum . 1037 1038 Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy 1039 Isotopically labeled proteins were expressed and purified as described for non - labeled 1040 proteins , using minimal media containing either N 15 NH 4 Cl or N 15 NH 4 Cl and C 13 glucose 1041 instead of traditional media . Proteins were purified into 100 mM NaCl , 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 0 , 1042 5 % ( w / v ) glycerol , 1 mM DTT and were supplemented with 10 % D 2 O . Protein concentration 1043 ranged from 70 µM ( GB1 tag ) to 850 µM ( GB1 - ICD ) . GB1 tag was produced by thrombin 1044 cleavage of GB1 - ICD and removal of ICD using nickel - NTA resin ( Qiagen ) . NMR spectra were 1045 collected on a Bruker 700 MHz spectrometer at Iowa State University equipped with z - shielded 1046 gradient triple resonance 5 mm TCI cryoprobe . 2D 1 H - 15 N TROSY - HSQC and 1 H - 15 N HSQC 1047 experiments were recorded with a time domain matrix consisting of 100 * ( t 1 , 15 N ) × 1024 * ( t 2 , 1048 Kramer et al 59 1 H ) complex points with acquisition time of 50 ms ( t 1 ) and 91 . 8 ms ( t 2 ) using 16 scans per FID 1049 and 1 . 5 s interscan delay . Spectral widths for 1 H and 15 N dimensions were set to 15 . 9 and 28 . 2 1050 ppm , respectively , with carriers set at 4 . 821 ppm ( 1 H ) and 119 . 138 ppm ( 15 N ) . Sequential 1051 1 H / 15 N / 13 C backbone assignments of the ICD were achieved using conventional 3D triple 1052 resonance correlation experiments [ HNCO , HNCA , and HN ( CO ) CA ] at 700 MHz . Secondary 1053 13 C a chemical shifts were calculated using Poulsen’s random coil database with corrections for 1054 pH , temperature , and neighbor amino acid correction ( Kjaergaard et al . , 2011 ; Kjaergaard and 1055 Poulsen , 2011 ) . All spectra were processed using NMRPipe ( Delaglio et al . , 1995 ) and displayed 1056 with SPARKY ( Lee et al . , 2015 ) . 1057 1058 Fluorophore labeling of proteins 1059 SNAP - tagged proteins were labeled with SNAP - Surface ® Alexa Fluor ® 488 , SNAP - 1060 Surface ® Alexa Fluor ® 546 , and SNAP - Surface ® Alexa Fluor ® 647 ( New England Biolabs ) . 1061 Protein ( 5 µM ) and dye ( 10 µM ) were mixed and allowed to react in 50KMEH5Gd at room 1062 temperature for 2 hours . Labeled proteins were desalted into 50KMEH5Gd buffer and 1063 concentrated . Extinction coefficients of fluorophores were calculated from a standard curve and 1064 are as follows : Alexa 488 at 495 nm , 95000 M - 1 * cm - 1 ; Alexa 546 at 556 nm , 120000 M - 1 * cm - 1 ; 1065 Alexa 647 at 650 nm , 255000 M - 1 * cm - 1 . Protein labeling efficiency was calculated by dividing 1066 protein concentration by dye concentration—for Alexa Fluor ® 488 the labeling efficiency was 1067 estimated at ~ 100 % , for Alexa Fluor ® 546 the labeling efficiency was estimated at ~ 60 % . 1068 1069 smTIRF data collection 1070 All time lapses were collected on a Nikon TE2000 - E inverted microscope equipped with 1071 a 100x 1 . 49 NA TIRF objective and a TIRF Quad filter cube ( Chroma C141789 ) , using an Andor 1072 iXon3 EM - CCD ( DU - 897 - CS0 ) camera , with a GATACA iLas system to prevent uneven 1073 illumination . Coverslips were prepared as described previously with slight modifications 1074 ( Narvaez - Ortiz and Nolen , 2022 ) . Briefly , glass coverslips ( VWR Cat # 48393 - 241 ) were 1075 cleaned with 2 % ( w / v ) Hellmanex , acetone , and 1 M KOH solutions with sonication , and rinsed 1076 extensively with DI water before each step and after the KOH treatment . Coverslips were rinsed 1077 with methanol and dried using a N 2 gas stream . GOPTES ( Fisher Cat # G0210100G ) was added 1078 to the coverslips , which were then baked at 75°C for 30 minutes . Coverslips were rinsed with 1079 Kramer et al 60 microscope - grade acetone and dried with N 2 gas stream . A 2 % ( w / w ) Biotin - PEG3000 / NH2 - 1080 PEG3000 mixture of powder ( Rapp Polymere GmbH ) was prepared , placed on top of the 1081 coverslips , and the coverslips baked overnight at 75°C . After overnight baking , the coverslips 1082 were washed with water and dried with N 2 gas . Individual wells were made by placing 1083 functionalized coverslips on Ibidi ® sticky - Slide IV 0 . 4 slides ( Ibidi Cat # 80608 ) . Individual 1084 lanes were prepared for microscopy by incubating with 5 % ( w / v ) Pluronic F - 127 for 10 min at 1085 RT , followed by either 100 nM ( for elongation rate analysis ) or 35 nM ( for side binding analysis ) 1086 neutravidin incubation ( in 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 200 mM NaCl , referred to as LS TBS for short ) 1087 for 10 min at RT , and either 10 nM ( for elongation rate analysis ) or 3 . 5 nM ( for side binding 1088 analysis ) biotinylated myosin ( in LS TBS ) incubation for 10 min at RT . The chambers were 1089 washed with 20 mg / mL BSA in 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 600 mM NaCl , and incubated with 20 1090 mg / mL BSA in LS TBS for 10 min at RT . Actin was diluted to a final concentration of 2 . 1 µM 1091 with 20 % Alexa - 647 labeling in 1X TIRF buffer ( final concentrations : 50 mM KCl , 2 mM 1092 MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA pH 8 . 0 , 10 mM Imidazole pH 7 . 0 , 25 mM glucose , 1 mM Trolox , 0 . 5 % 1093 methylcellulose ( 400 cP ) , 20 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol , 0 . 4 mM ATP , 20 mg / mL BSA , 0 . 02 1094 mg / mL catalase , 0 . 1 mg / mL glucose oxidase , 1 mM 4 - nitrobenzyl alcohol , and 0 . 5 mM propyl 1095 gallate ) and allowed to polymerize on the slide for 5 minutes at room temperature . Excess actin 1096 was removed by two washes , each time using 40 µL of 1X TIRF buffer . A separate mixture of 1 1097 µM actin with 20 % Alexa - 647 labeling containing desired proteins in 1X TIRF buffer was then 1098 added to the wells to start data acquisition . Time lapse images were acquired using the following 1099 setups . Experiments involving unlabeled HPO - 30 ICD and CapZ for elongation rate analysis of 1100 actin AF647 : 640 - nm laser , 5 % power , 50 ms exposure time , and a 5 - s interval between exposures ; 1101 experiments involving CapZ AF488 : 488 - nm laser ( 15 % power , 50 ms exposure time ) and 640 - nm 1102 laser ( 5 % power , 50 ms exposure time ) , alternating between 20 consecutive exposures in the 1103 488 - nm channel for CapZ AF488 and one exposure in the 640 - nm channel for actin AF647 , with a 1104 500 - ms interval between exposures ; experiments involving HPO - 30 ICD AF546 : 561 - nm laser 1105 ( 10 % power , 50 or 100 ms exposure time ) and 640 - nm laser ( 5 % power , 50 ms exposure time ) , 1106 alternating between 20 consecutive exposures in the 561 - nm channel for ICD AF546 and one 1107 exposure in the 640 - nm channel for actin AF647 , with a 500 - ms interval between exposures . 1108 1109 smTIRF data processing - actin elongation rate measurement 1110 Kramer et al 61 Time lapses were opened in ImageJ and the background removed using a rolling ball radius of 10 1111 pixels . The length of actin filaments was calculated using the Filament Length ImageJ plugin , 1112 kindly provided by Jeff Kuhn , using a Gaussian - Radius of 1 . 5 - 2 , determined for each individual 1113 movie ( Kuhn and Pollard , 2005 ) . The length ( in microns ) was converted to subunits using the 1114 established value of 370 actin subunits / µm ( Huxley and Brown , 1967 ) . Time points were taken 1115 from the NIS Elements software . Filaments were only selected if they were present within the 1116 first 10 frames of the movie and did not leave the frame during the course of the video . 10 time 1117 points were selected and the length at each point was calculated , and the average slope was used 1118 for the actin elongation rate . ANOVA with Dunn - Tukey tests were used to determine 1119 significance . 1120 1121 smTIRF data processing - side - binding / capping analysis 1122 Time lapses were opened in ImageJ and the background removed using a rolling ball radius 1123 of 10 pixels . Only filaments present at the beginning of the videos and those that did not leave 1124 the frame during the duration of the video were selected . Analysis was performed in a single - 1125 blinded manner . Side binding events were determined if they met the following criteria : 1 ) the 1126 ICD / empty tag puncta must be present for more than one frame ; 2 ) the ICD / empty tag puncta 1127 must move with the filament at least once ; 3 ) the filament must not move away from the 1128 ICD / empty tag puncta ; 4 ) the HPO - 30 / vector puncta must be smaller than a circle with a radius 1129 of 4 pixels . Capping events were confirmed by the absence of growth with puncta present and , if 1130 available , growth from the end capped after the puncta leaves the filament . A Student’s t - test was 1131 used to determine significance between ICD and tag reactions . 1132 1133 Actin pelleting assay 1134 Actin pelleting assays were performed based on previous protocols ( Heier et al . , 2017 ) 1135 with slight modifications . Actin was pre - polymerized at room temperature overnight by addition 1136 of 1X 50KMEH5Gd . Reactions ( 60 µL ) were assembled by mixing 2 µM actin and 1 µM protein 1137 ( in the same 50KMEH5Gd buffer ) , which were then allowed to bind at room temperature for 30 1138 minutes . Reactions were centrifuged at 100 , 000 g at 4 °C for 30 min in a Type 42 . 2 Ti rotor in a 1139 Beckman ultracentrifuge . 40 µL of the supernatant was removed and mixed with SDS PAGE 1140 loading buffer , and the remaining ~ 15 µL was removed and discarded . The pellet was dissolved 1141 Kramer et al 62 by the addition of 40 µL of G - buffer , followed by brief pipetting and vortexing , and allowed to 1142 sit at room temperature for 5 min before the liquid was removed and mixed with SDS PAGE 1143 loading buffer . The intensity of the supernatant and pellet bands on SDS PAGE gels were 1144 measured using ImageJ . The total intensity of the supernatant and pellet bands , and the 1145 percentage of intensity from the pellet and the supernatant were calculated . The percentage of 1146 pelleted protein was calculated by subtracting the percentage of intensity from the pelleted 1147 protein in the absence of actin from the percentage of intensity from the pelleted protein in the 1148 presence of actin . For example , in Figure 6A , the intensity of BSA from lanes 1 and 2 was 1149 summed and the percentage of intensity from 1 and from 2 were calculated . This was repeated 1150 for lanes 3 and 4 , then the percentage intensity of lane 2 was subtracted from lane 4 . ANOVA 1151 with Dunn - Tukey tests were used to determine significance . 1152 To quantify the dissociation constant of F - actin binding , 0 . 2 µM F / F - ICD was mixed with 1153 increasing concentrations of polymerized actin and pelleted as described above . The 1154 concentration of F - actin was estimated to be the same as the concentration of G - actin . 40 µL of 1155 the supernatant was removed and mixed with SDS for visualization on a gel . The intensity of 1156 both F / F - ICD bands was quantified using ImageJ to calculate the fractional occupancy . The data 1157 was fitted in DynaFit using a single binding site model ( Kuzmic , 1996 ) . 1158 1159 Actin pelleting competition assays 1160 Actin pelleting competition assays were performed nearly identically to the actin 1161 pelleting assay described above , except that after 30 minutes of incubation of 5 µM HPO - 30 ICD 1162 proteins with 2 µM actin , 600 nM CapZ was added and incubated for 5 minutes before 1163 ultracentrifugation . The intensity of the top bands for CapZ in the pellet were calculated for all 1164 reactions and corrected for the intensity of CapZ pelleted without actin . The relative intensity 1165 was calculated by dividing the intensity of the lane by the intensity of the lane containing CapZ 1166 with actin alone . For example , in Figure 7D , the intensity of lane 2 was subtracted from lanes 4 , 1167 6 , 8 , and 10 . Then , the corrected intensity of lane 6 , 8 , and 10 was divided by the corrected 1168 intensity of lane 4 . ANOVA with Dunn - Tukey tests were used to determine significance . 1169 1170 Tryptophan fluorescence assays 1171 Kramer et al 63 Untagged ICD and GB1 tag were purified into 50 mM NaCl , 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 0 , 5 % 1172 ( w / v ) glycerol , 5 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ( called 50 PDB , for pull - down buffer ) . Tryptophan 1173 powder ( Sigma Cat # 73 - 22 - 3 ) and BSA ( Fisher Cat # BP1600 - 100 ) were dissolved in the same 1174 buffer . Solutions were made at the correct concentrations ( ranging from 0 to 50 µM ) and an 1175 emission scan was measured from 320nm to 400nm . The absorption wavelength was set to 1176 243nm to minimize the fluorescence value and prevent the inner - filter effect from non - 1177 specifically reducing the emission values ( Weitner et al . , 2022 ) . The excitation and emission slit 1178 widths were set to 3 nm . All measurements were performed on a Horiba Scientific FluoroMax 1179 spectrofluorometer in 3 mm quartz cuvettes ( Starna Cells , Inc . Cat # 3 - 3 . 45 - Q - 3 ) . Normalized 1180 peak fluorescent values were calculated by dividing the fluorescence value of the peak by the 1181 concentration of that sample . 1182 Untagged ICD “black” W22R was purified into 50 PDB . To measure the concentration , 1183 samples of a known concentration of WT ICD were run on a gel and used to make a standard 1184 curve . Experiments were performed as described above for ICD WT . To calculate the 1185 fluorescence of ICD WT + ICD “black” W22R , the fluorescence of ICD “black” W22R alone 1186 was subtracted from the fluorescence of ICD “black” W22R + ICD WT . Extra NaCl was added 1187 to the 200PDB samples to bring the final salt concentration to 200 mM NaCl . 1188 1189 Molecular dynamics simulations 1190 All - atom MD simulations were performed for each structural model using the Condo 1191 cluster at the High - Performance Computing facility at Iowa State University . These simulations 1192 were conducted with GROMACS ( Abraham et al . , 2015 ) using the AMBER99SP - disp forcefield 1193 ( Robustelli et al . , 2018 ) . The system was solvated in a triclinic simulation box with TIP4P water 1194 molecules . Bonds to hydrogen were constrained via the LINCS algorithm ( Hess et al . , 1997 ) . 1195 Short - range electrostatic and Lennard - Jones interactions were calculated with a plain coulomb 1196 cutoff of 1 . 0 nm . The Particle Mesh Ewald ( PME ) scheme with grid spacing of 0 . 16 nm was 1197 utilized for long range electrostatic interactions ( Essmann et al . , 1995 ) . Solvent and solute were 1198 separately coupled to a modified Berendsen thermostat ( Velocity Rescale ) with a reference 1199 temperature of 300 K and Parinello - Rahman barostat with a reference pressure of 1 bar . 1200 Minimization and equilibration were performed for 1 ns coupled to a Berendsen thermostat 1201 ( Velocity - rescale ) with a reference temperature of 300K and a reference pressure of 1 bar 1202 Kramer et al 64 coupled to . After energy minimization and a 1 ns equilibration , the molecular dynamics 1203 simulations were carried out over 200 ns with 2 femtoseconds timesteps and leap - frog integrator . 1204 1205 S2 cell culture and transfection 1206 Drosophila S2 cells were grown in Schneider’s media ( Thermo Fisher ) supplemented with 10 % 1207 heat - inactivated FBS ( Life Technologies ) and 50 U / mL penicillin - streptomycin ( Thermo Fisher ) . 1208 Cells were transfected with Effectene ( Qiagen ) and 1ug of total plasmid ( either Pactin > HPO - 1209 30 : 6xMyc ( pXD384 ) or both Pactin > HPO - 30 : 6xMyc ( pXD384 ) and Pactin > HPO - 30 : HA 1210 ( pXD226 ) ) . 1211 1212 Co - immunoprecipitation 1213 S2 cells were harvested 72 hours after transfection . Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer ( Thermo 1214 Fisher ) with 1x Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( Thermofisher ) for 30 minutes on ice . Cell 1215 lysates were incubated with anti - HA affinity gel beads ( Sigma E6779 - 1ML ) for 1 hour at 4℃ 1216 with rotation . Proteins were eluted at 80℃ in NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer ( Life Technologies ) 1217 supplemented with DTT ( GoldBio ) and detected using Western blot with mouse antibody to HA 1218 ( 1 : 1000 , Sigma H3663 ) , rabbit antibody to Myc ( 1 : 1000 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc - 789 ) , and 1219 HRP - conjugated goat antibodies to mouse ( 1 : 20 , 000 , Jackson Immuno Research ) . 1220 1221 Acknowledgements 1222 We thank ResearchIT at Iowa State University for installing AlphaFold 2 and AlphaFold 1223 Multimer ; Daniel Boesch for help with submitting AlphaFold prediction tasks ; Scott Nelson at 1224 Iowa State for guidance with CD spectroscopy ; Xuefeng Wang at Iowa State for the initial setup 1225 of smTIRF experiments ; Aubrey Sijo - Gonzales , Finlan Rhodes , Leyuan Loh , Ganesh Prasad , 1226 Simanta Mitra , and ResearchIT at Iowa State University for establishing a web - based application 1227 ( https : / / biochempy . bb . iastate . edu ) for data visualization ; and Michael Rosen at UT Southwestern 1228 for sharing FKBP / FRB constructs .
