Coffman 1 and Jian - Qiu Wu 1 , 2 1 Department of Molecular Genetics , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH 43210 , USA 2 Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH 43210 , USA In recent years , quantiﬁcation of absolute protein num - bers in cellular structures using ﬂuorescence microscopy has become a reality . Two popular methods are available to a broad range of researchers with minimal equipment and analysis requirements : stepwise photobleaching to count discrete changes in intensity from a small number of ﬂuorescent fusion proteins , and comparing the ﬂuo - rescence intensity of a protein to a known in vivo or in vitro standard . This review summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each method , and gives recent examples of each that answer important questions in their respective ﬁelds . We also highlight new counting methods that could become widely available in the future . Live - cell protein quantiﬁcation The discovery and utilization of GFP from Aequorea victo - ria for cell imaging is a watershed achievement in biologi - cal research . Fluorescence occurs when light is emitted from the ﬂuorophore in response to an absorbed light , and GFP is capable of ﬂuorescence without enzymatic modiﬁ - cation or a cofactor , allowing expression of a single gene to result in detectable emission in any organism . Fluores - cence imaging has since become a powerful tool to answer many questions in biology . Cell biology is becoming increasingly quantitative . Many researchers are interested in counting protein mole - cules in live cells to deﬁne stoichiometry of functional protein complexes and to build models of cellular struc - tures [ 1 – 23 ] . As technology and equipment improve , quan - titative ﬂuorescence microscopy is becoming more accurate . Genome - wide studies might miss information about low - abundance proteins or local protein concentra - tions [ 24 – 26 ] , stressing the need for single - cell and even single - molecule experiments . Although various methods for counting proteins in vivo exist , this review focuses on two ﬂuorescence microscopy methods that are currently the most accessible to most researchers : stepwise photobleaching and ratio compari - son to ﬂuorescent standards . Speciﬁc details of the meth - ods have been reported elsewhere [ 27 – 29 ] , so this review focuses on the advantages and disadvantages of both methods and some applications of each . Both methods can utilize standard imaging equipment and ﬂuorescent fusion proteins ( see Glossary ) , without requiring special - ized systems or analysis software . This review also touches on some new methods that will likely be useful for protein quantiﬁcation in the future . Counting protein molecules by stepwise photobleaching One ﬂuorescence microscopy method for counting protein molecules is stepwise photobleaching . This approach relies on the irreversible and stochastic loss of ﬂuorescence from Review Glossary Blinking : reversible loss of emission intensity from FPs due to transition to a nonemissive triplet state more likely to occur at higher excitation intensities . Diffraction limit : the best resolution that can be obtained by a light microscope , given by optical emission wavelength ( l ) divided by two times the numerical aperture ( N . A . ) of the objective lens ( l / 2N . A . ) ; (cid:2) 200 nm at best . Flow cytometry : a process by which cells or microscopic particles in suspension flow past a detector one at a time and the detector counts the number and records the fluorescence intensity and other parameters . Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) : a technique in which fluctuations of fluorescence intensity are measured within a small volume and physical properties ( e . g . , rate of diffusion , concentration of molecules , interactions ) of the fluorescent molecules passing through that volume can be mathematically extracted using autocorrelation functions . Fluorescent fusion protein : the gene for a fluorescent protein , such as GFP , is inserted in frame up - or downstream of the gene for a protein of interest , so that when transcribed and translated , the resulting protein of interest is fused to GFP . Fo¨ rster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) : energy transfer from a donor fluorophore to an acceptor fluorophore in close proximity ( < 10 nm and depending on the alignment of the fluorophores with respect to one another ) when the donor emission wavelength overlaps the acceptor excitation wavelength . Full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) : on a Gaussian curve , the width of the curve at a height that is half the maximum height . The FWHM of the point spread function approximates Z axis or axial resolution . Maturation efficiency : the time it takes for a fluorophore , such as GFP , to mature to its fluorescent state via rearrangements and chemical reactions among amino acids . Noise : inconstant imprecise output above and below a real signal that disturbs or interferes with detection of the signal , usually referred to as ‘snow’ on a television screen when the broadcast signal is lost . Photobleaching : irreversible loss of fluorescence due to exposure to an excitation light source . Point spread function ( PSF ) : the apparent blurring of intensity from a point source of light , such as a fluorescent bead or protein , due to diffraction of light by the lens . Super - resolution microscopy : any technique that breaks the diffraction limit of fluorescence microscopy ( (cid:2) 200 nm ) by pinpointing the exact location of point sources and representing the image using those locations rather than the additive point spread functions of all point sources in an imaging field . Transcription activator - like effector nuclease ( TALEN ) : a protein constructed by fusing a truncated transcription activator - like effector to FokI restriction enzyme . Each TALE repeat binds a single DNA base pair , making them more versatile than zinc fingers . TALENs can be used for high - throughput genome editing . Zinc finger nuclease ( ZFN ) : a protein constructed by fusing a zinc finger , which is a DNA binding motif , to a restriction enzyme ; usually FokI is used because it has a nonspecific cleavage site . Zinc fingers can be combined to recognize specific sequences of DNA on either side of a desired cleavage site , and FokI dimerizes in the middle and creates a double - stranded break . Existing DNA repair mechanisms can utilize homologous sequences supplied exogenously to insert DNA while repairing the break . Corresponding author : Wu , J . - Q .

The method involves continuous exposure of the sample to the excitation light at low enough intensity that the sample is slowly bleached until its emission intensity reaches background level . The appropriate light intensity and exposure time differ depending on the number of ﬂuorescent molecules in the structure of interest . The key to optimizing these conditions is to minimize missed bleaching events that occur when two ( or more ) ﬂuoro - phores are bleached simultaneously or too closely to be resolved , resulting in a step approximately twice the size of other steps ( Figure 1 ) . Because the likelihood of missed events increases exponentially with the number of mole - cules in a structure [ 28 ] , the bleaching method is only useful for low protein numbers . Das et al . have estimated that a maximum of 15 bleaching steps can be directly detected without mathematical extrapolation , although they detected no more than seven steps in their experi - ments [ 30 ] . The upper limit for the number of countable molecules , using the photobleaching method , can be extended using mathematical aids . Several groups have simulated bleach - ing events to estimate the likely number of visible bleach steps [ 28 , 30 , 31 ] . This approach is essential when using dyes that have < 100 % labeling efﬁciency , or ﬂuorophores that have < 100 % maturation efﬁciency . Another way to estimate the number of bleach steps is to measure the steps that are visible ( the difference of consecutive plateau means ) , calculate the step size of bleaching a single ﬂuor - ophore using a G distribution , and divide the starting intensity by the step size [ 2 , 10 , 32 , 33 ] . The histogram of photobleaching step sizes can include steps that are > 1 bleaching event , therefore the mode of the G distribution ( m – SD 2 / m , where m = mean and SD = standard deviation ) represents the most probable step size from bleaching one molecule [ 2 , 33 ] . We do not recommend a Fourier ( or power ) spectral analysis of the step sizes to determine the size that occurs with the highest frequency , because it is technically more difﬁcult than calculating the mode of the G distribution and does not signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy [ 10 , 32 ] . Even with mathematical aids , the largest reported number counted by photobleaching is (cid:2) 30 molecules [ 32 ] . Whether the bleaching events are counted directly or the step size is calculated , analysis of the data is more complex than the ratio imaging method . A background correction is necessary to remove ﬂuorescence from dif - fused proteins and other background sources from the starting intensity . For photobleaching data , regions of interest ( ROIs ) should be selected to minimize the chance of emission overlap between multiple structures [ 28 , 30 ] . Because the raw data are noisy , it is also necessary to ﬁlter the data to reveal the discrete drops . Three ﬁlters were recently evaluated for quantiﬁcation of the bacterial repli - some [ 15 ] ( Figure 2 ) . An edge - preserving running average , known as the Chung – Kennedy ﬁlter , is the most appropri - ate of those tested . Brieﬂy , it calculates the mean and SD in two consecutive sets within the data from one photobleach - ing ROI , and reports the mean of the set with the lower SD . If a set includes points along two plateaus , the SD will be higher , and it will not be reported . Thus the reported values lie along single plateaus , and the steps are pre - served [ 2 , 32 ] ( Figure 1 ) . It is similar to a running median but produces an SD (cid:2) 30 % lower [ 15 ] . The number of data points in the set that is averaged should be large enough to reduce the noise but small enough to ensure that few steps are missed [ 15 ] . Leake et al . used a modiﬁed photobleach - ing approach to quantify mobile particles at the cell mem - brane in Escherichia coli , which included automated tracking of particles during bleaching [ 11 ] . ImageJ plug - ins are available for automated particle tracking , and the Chung – Kennedy ﬁlter can be applied using formulas in a spreadsheet application , thus both analyses are executable by most researchers . Quantiﬁcation by ratio comparison to ﬂuorescent standards Another straightforward approach for counting protein molecules is to measure the ratio of the ﬂuorescence inten - sities of a protein of interest to a standard with a known molecule number ( discussed later ) . In essence , this method uses a series of images of cells that express either the protein of interest or the standard , each fused to an FP that has suitable ﬂuorescent properties ( see the section on properties of ﬂuorescent proteins ) . If the standard can be distinguished from the protein of interest , it is desirable to include cells that express the standard and experimen - tal fusion proteins on the same slide to ensure comparable illumination . If the standard is not distinguishable , images can be taken consecutively or another marker can be imaged separately to distinguish the control cells [ 27 , 34 ] , as long as the two ﬂuorophores are sufﬁciently distant to eliminate Fo ¨ rster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) . One advantage of this method is that a much greater number of protein molecules can be counted than with the photobleaching method . Several corrections might be necessary to achieve accu - rate measurements . Correcting for uneven illumination in the microscope system is needed if the whole ﬁeld is used , but this is optional if measurements are only taken near the center of a ﬁeld [ 2 , 27 , 29 , 35 ] .

Review Trends in Biochemical Sciences November 2012 , Vol . 37 , No . 11 500 are at different depths relative to the coverslip , the effect of depth on intensity should be calibrated and corrected using ﬂuorescent beads [ 27 , 36 ] . This correction is different for each system but is essential if an in vitro standard is measured using total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy , in which the sample is much closer to the coverslip compared to the molecules in a cell . Fluo - rescence intensity and exposure time are linearly propor - tional within a certain range of exposure times for each camera , so different exposure times can be utilized and corrected to keep the signal to noise ratio high and avoid saturation [ 29 , 36 ] . Exposure times below or above the linear range will skew the intensity by camera noise or photobleaching , respectively [ 29 ] . Changes to excitation intensity might result in nonlinear changes to photon counts due to the increased likelihood of blinking mole - cules as excitation intensity increases [ 37 ] ; therefore , exci - tation intensity should be kept constant between samples . After appropriate corrections , the ROI should be chosen to include > 90 % of the signal in the structure [ 2 , 27 ] . Complex analysis to determine the centroids of ﬂuorescent spots is not always necessary because it yields similar data com - pared to simply ﬁtting an ROI centered on the brightest pixel [ 27 , 28 ] . Similar to the bleaching method , intracellu - lar background must be subtracted . The background should be taken from a concentric area unless there are overlapping neighboring signals or an inhomogeneous cytoplasmic intensity [ 9 , 18 , 27 , 35 ] . The most important factor for the ratio comparison method is a trustworthy standard . Some commonly used standards were recently evaluated [ 2 , 36 , 38 ] , resulting in a wide variety of reliable standards that can now be used to generate a standard curve without the need for immuno - blotting or ﬂow cytometry [ 29 ] ( Figure 3 ) . The standards used were : ( i ) MotB , a protein from E . coli that has 22 molecules per motor [ 10 ] ; ( ii ) puriﬁed enhanced GFP ( EGFP with F64L and S65T mutations ) diluted to view single molecules [ 36 ] ; and ( iii ) viral particles that have 120 EGFPs per assembled capsid [ 39 ] . Puriﬁed EGFP and viral particles are extracellular , and MotB is intracellular , mak - ing it necessary to verify equivalent ﬂuorescence in differ - ent conditions ( see the section on properties of ﬂuorescent proteins ) . When comparing structures of different sizes , or pro - teins of the same structure but with very different intensi - ties , it can be necessary to use the sum intensity of multiple z sections rather than the intensity of the best focal plane [ 2 , 18 ] . The full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) of the Gaussian - ﬁtted z axis point spread function ( PSF ) of ﬂuo - rescent bead or quantum dot images is the appropriate spacing of z sections for sum intensity [ 2 , 18 , 40 , 41 ] . The percentage of total intensity of a protein in the best focal plane differs , depending on the density / distribution of the protein or size / shape of the structure [ 2 , 18 ] . To ensure the accuracy of the numbers measured , additional veriﬁca - tions are recommended . For example , one might need to sequence genomic DNA to make sure that there are no gene duplications or mutations in the tags . If the excitation power is constant , similar results should be obtained by mixing the cells or imaging consecutively , and measuring ratios on different days [ 2 , 3 , 18 ] . The ratio method of quantiﬁcation can be extended to count proteins over time during their accumulation at a speciﬁc location in the cell [ 3 , 9 , 12 , 18 ] . Time - lapse quanti - ﬁcation requires correction for the photobleaching over time . In two studies , the intensity at the best focal plane was corrected to represent the total intensity based on the percentage calculated from single stacks at FWHM spacing [ 9 , 18 ] . This correction can introduce some error if the positioning of the slice is off - centered compared to the real location of the best focal plane . In the ﬁssion yeast Schi - zosaccharomyces pombe , observation of protein numbers over time revealed a two - step accumulation of proteins , which was not obvious when taking a static measurement [ 2 , 9 ] . Thus , the number of molecules of each protein and their relative stoichiometries can be obtained using the ratio method at one or many time points . Important considerations in counting proteins Several important factors affect both protein counting methods ( Box 1 ) . Because some dyes label inefﬁciently , Two engaged polymerases T i BS 10 nm τ Pol III core ( α , ε , & θ ) β DnaB δ′ δ Ssb Primer Primase Figure 2 . A revised model of the bacterial DNA polymerase based on stoichiometry data obtained using stepwise photobleaching . Three pol III polymerase cores ( orange ) exist in each replisome , two of which are usually associated with b clamps , and the third might be poised to extend the next lagging strand primer . A third b clamp is distant to the core replisome ( 50 nm gray circle ) in 75 % of replisomes . Previous models included only two polymerases coordinately replicating the leading and lagging DNA strands . The presence of a third Pol III may help lagging strand synthesis keep pace with leading strand synthesis . Reproduced , with permission , from [ 15 ] . Review Trends in Biochemical Sciences November 2012 , Vol . 37 , No . 11 501 mathematical simulations of expected results or binomial ﬁts of the data are necessary when those dyes are used [ 30 , 31 ] . Thus , genetically encoded FPs should be used where possible , because they will be in a 1 : 1 stoichiometry with the protein of interest if the endogenous locus is disrupted or replaced with the fusion protein [ 27 , 29 ] . The maturation efﬁciency or proportion of unfolded FPs can affect this ratio in some cases [ 27 – 29 ] . We also note that in vivo ﬂuorescence quantiﬁcation can include both molecules that are incorporated into a structure and mole - cules that are close to the intended structure but within the diffraction limit , and ﬂuorescence recovery after photo - bleaching ( FRAP ) can be used to reveal the different frac - tions [ 2 , 7 , 9 , 42 – 44 ] . Properties of FPs The properties of FPs are important considerations for both counting methods . Before constructing fusion pro - teins , the folding and maturation efﬁciency , brightness , and photostability of the FPs used in the fusions should be considered [ 27 , 45 , 46 ] . It is important for researchers to be aware of recently developed FPs , and use the best ones available to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio , especially for less abundant proteins [ 35 ] . Because GFP can dimerize at high concentrations [ 46 ] , GFP and YFP variants with the monomeric mutation ( A206K ) are preferred . Red FPs such as mCherry have inferior physical properties , but can still be used as a second label if needed [ 47 ] . Cellular autoﬂuorescence should be reduced as much as possible , especially when quantifying proteins that have low levels . Thus , FPs that have excitation / emission wavelengths for which autoﬂuorescence is low , such as mYFP and mECi - trine in ﬁssion yeast , are preferred [ 29 ] . It remains unclear whether maturation or folding efﬁciency of FPs is a major source of error . For example , 75 – 80 % of YFP was found to be active in a single - molecule pull - down assay and in Xenopus laevis oocytes that were injected with mRNA for a tagged gene [ 28 , 47 ] . However , in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , g - tubulin had a similar ratio to the standard , whether they were both tagged with EGFP or a superfolding variant , suggesting that the ratio method is insensitive to the folding efﬁciency [ 3 ] . Additionally , all YFP was folded in E . coli cell extracts , and the total ﬂuorescence in the cell was changed by < 10 % after protein translation was stopped [ 10 , 11 ] . The discrepancy in matu - ration or folding efﬁciency in these reports might be at - tributed to the use of different FPs or different organisms , and might need to be evaluated for individual cases . To - gether , these data suggest that YFP maturation and fold - ing efﬁciency are not major issues for counting proteins , especially for proteins with low turnover rates . Functionality of ﬂuorescent fusion proteins The functionality and expression level of a fusion protein should be similar to wild type . One of the advantages of using yeasts is that the native protein can be replaced by a ﬂuorescent fusion protein using homologous recombina - tion , and the functionality of the fusion protein can be easily checked . A ﬂexible linker between the FP and pro - tein of interest might improve the functionalities for some proteins [ 2 ] . To circumvent the inability to replace endog - enous genes with tagged versions , several options to count proteins exist ; however , these methods might require assumptions about the relative incorporation of tagged and untagged proteins . These assumptions should be 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 Key : 3 . 3 4 1 . 67 5 . 0 1 6 . 6 7 8 . 3 4 10 . 01 M e a n i n t e n s i t y / c e ll ( x 1000 , A .

Sources of variation in counting proteins All quantification techniques necessitate the same question : how can one distinguish between biological variation and variation from other sources ? Other sources include systematic error , due to the microscope system itself ; measurement error , due to the limitations of resolution and techniques ; and noise , arising from stochasticity of photon emission and collection [ 35 ] . For many applications , it would be useful to know the true biological variation in a structure . In some cases , biochemistry can tell us that a structure should have a fixed number of molecules [ 10 , 28 , 30 , 31 ] . In these instances , the error likely arises from sources other than biological variation . However , what if biological variation is a key feature of the structure ? For example , cytokinesis nodes , which are precursors of the contractile ring in fission yeast , display a large variation in numbers of a single protein from one node to another [ 2 , 9 ] and pairs of node proteins do not always colocalize in individual nodes [ 9 , 62 , 72 ] , suggesting that their varied composition might be significant . Interestingly , only a few proteins in actin patches have a large variation in their peak intensity [ 18 ] . In these cases , how much variation can be attributed to biology ? A partial answer to the aforementioned question is revealed using the coefficient of variation that equals the SD divided by the mean . Photobleaching data on single molecules of Venus FP have a 27 % variation [ 33 ] , which is only attributable to nonbiological sources . Interestingly , coefficients of variation for MotB [ 2 , 10 ] , kinetochore components [ 2 , 8 , 27 ] , and most peak numbers in actin patches [ 18 ] were (cid:4) 27 % , suggesting that these structures might tolerate less biological variation . By contrast , proteins in fission yeast cytokinesis nodes exhibited 35 – 60 % variation at their plateaus of accumulation [ 2 , 9 ] , suggesting that 5 – 30 % of the variation could be biological , although some less abundant proteins at nodes might exhibit greater variation due to lower signal - to - noise ratios . These exam - ples suggest that a coefficient of variation from nonbiological sources , such as from a single molecule bleaching experiment , could be used to assess the amount of biological variation in a set of data from the same system . Review Trends in Biochemical Sciences November 2012 , Vol . 37 , No . 11 502 stated clearly so that interpretations can be evaluated . For example , a small fraction of actin was tagged because the tagged version could not replace the endogenous actin in ﬁssion yeast [ 40 ] . To quantify local actin abundance in actin patches , the data were corrected after measuring the ratio of tagged and untagged protein by immunoblotting . This correction is only accurate if the assumption that tagged and untagged actin are utilized with similar efﬁ - ciency in actin patches is true . The tagged actin cannot incorporate into the contractile ring because of the proper - ties of formins [ 48 ] . Thus , actin concentration in the ring was estimated from electron microscope images [ 40 ] . If the tagged protein must be added exogenously , it might be necessary to express proteins near the wild - type level to minimize adverse effects of overexpression [ 8 ] . Another strategy was used by Engel et al . ; they counted exogenous tagged proteins in green algae Chlamydomonas reinhard - tii ﬂagella using the stepwise photobleaching method in a mutant background in which the endogenous protein does not localize , thus eliminating the need for assumptions about the ratio of tagged and untagged proteins [ 32 ] . With the recent introduction of novel ‘genome editing’ techni - ques , endogenous genes can be tagged in any model organ - ism in which the zinc ﬁnger nuclease or transcription activator - like effector nuclease genes can be introduced [ 49 , 50 ] . Thus quantitative ﬂuorescence microscopy will be easier in more organisms in the future . In vivo versus in vitro standards and quenching Another source of concern in counting proteins is the environment in which the proteins are being measured . In early studies [ 41 , 51 – 57 ] , in vitro standards were com - mon , but it was unknown how the environment affects the ﬂuorescence intensity , leading researchers to use immu - noblotting or internal standards to calibrate ﬂuorescence intensity inside the cell [ 27 , 29 ] . However , it was recently reported that the intensity of a single YFP variant YPet in vitro is equal to the intensity drop from photobleaching each YPet in E . coli [ 15 ] . In addition , ratio measurements between E . coli and S . pombe agree with the numbers obtained by bleaching S . pombe proteins , suggesting that the two intracellular environments have similar effects on GFP ﬂuorescence [ 2 ] . Together , these data suggest that in vitro YFP / GFP is comparable to YFP / GFP in bacteria or yeast . The effects of other cell types on ﬂuorescence inten - sity have not been tested , although molecule numbers have been reported [ 8 , 23 ] . Some ﬂuorophores are sensitive to changes in pH and halide ion concentrations [ 46 ] , which could be different in some cell types or in different com - partments within cells . Fluorescence quenching might occur if FPs are packed into very dense structures . Puriﬁed EGFP and EGFP - tagged viral particles yield different values for a single EGFP , suggesting that quenching occurs in the viral par - ticle where 120 tagged coat proteins are packed into a small volume [ 36 ] . However , an earlier study reported that there was no quenching based on extinction coefﬁcients [ 39 ] . Moreover , evidence for quenching inside ﬁssion yeast cells is lacking so far [ 2 , 40 ] . For example , after disrupting actin patches using latrunculin A , the total cellular ﬂuo - rescence of the actin crosslinker ﬁmbrin was unchanged , indicating that the close proximity of > 500 ﬁmbrin mole - cules in an actin patch did not generate obvious quenching [ 40 ] . Thus , the effects of quenching on the accuracy of protein quantiﬁcation should be addressed individually for speciﬁc structures of interest . One way to measure quenching due to environmental changes is by ﬂuorescence lifetime imaging , but this technique requires specialized equipment and analysis [ 58 , 59 ] . Moreover , the relation between ﬂuorescence lifetime ( in nanoseconds ) and the ﬂuorescence intensity measured on > 100 ms timescales is unclear , making it difﬁcult to correct ﬂuorescence inten - sity using differences in ﬂuorescence lifetime . Validation of protein quantiﬁcation by complementary approaches As alluded to previously , validating quantiﬁcation results with complementary techniques is important . Global cel - lular concentrations can be validated by ﬂow cytometry for abundant proteins [ 40 ] ( Figure 3 ) or by ﬂuorescence corre - lation spectroscopy for sparse proteins at higher spatial and temporal resolution [ 59 , 60 ] . The quantiﬁcation of E . coli MotB is consistent with electron micrographs and biochemical data [ 10 ] . Similarly , formin speckles have about two molecules , and this is consistent with the strong dimerization of formins [ 2 , 61 , 62 ] . Biochemical characteri - zation or other ﬁndings should guide the interpretation of results , especially for experiments in which native un - tagged protein is still present in the cell [ 8 ] . Protein con - centrations from ﬂuorescence microscopy should also be consistent with quantitative immunoblotting [ 29 , 63 ] ( Figure 3 ) . The function of the protein can also be informa - tive . In a recent paper about the microtubule organizing center , 17 molecules of g - tubulin were counted per micro - tubule [ 3 ] . The authors assumed that all the g - tubulin was involved in microtubule nucleation and that each nucle - ation site was equivalent ( Figure 4 ) . Microtubules exhibit 13 protoﬁlaments in electron micrographs , therefore an explanation for four additional g - tubulins was offered [ 3 ] . A protein counting experiment should utilize suitable ﬂuorescent protein genes , ideally fused to the gene of interest at the native locus , producing fusion proteins that accomplish wild - type functions . Suitable standards and controls for environmental changes or the possibility of quenching will ensure appropriate interpretations of the data , which should be validated with complementary experiments if possible . Ultimately , the need for such standards might be superseded by super - resolution and single molecule techniques . Future of counting proteins using ﬂuorescence microscopy Super - resolution microscopy techniques , such as photoac - tivated localization microscopy ( PALM ) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) , can produce much higher resolution images of intracellular structures than confocal microscopy by pinpointing exact locations of individual ﬂuorescent molecules [ 64 , 65 ] . Quantitative in - formation from PALM imaging has recently been derived [ 66 – 68 ] . The main hindrance to quantiﬁcation is that the contribution of blinking ﬂuorophores to the ﬁnal image is unknown . Super - resolution techniques have been made Review Trends in Biochemical Sciences November 2012 , Vol . 37 , No . 11 503 more accessible to researchers ( although at a lower reso - lution ) with the introduction of bleaching / blinking assisted localization microscopy ( BaLM ) . BaLM requires no spe - cialized equipment , uses standard dyes and FPs , and uses freely available ImageJ software and plug - ins to analyze the data [ 69 ] . The disadvantage of this method is that it has not been done in live cells and ﬁxation could affect quanti - ﬁcation [ 35 , 69 ] . The key to counting proteins with super - resolution microscopy techniques will be to simplify the analysis of high density images of FPs and minimize errors ( caused by blinking or failure to photobleach ) to ensure that each FP is counted only once [ 66 – 68 ] . Although algo - rithms to eliminate duplicate counting have been reported , a proof of principle experiment showing that these algo - rithms can reproduce numbers that are known by other methods is lacking . In a recent study , PALM data subjected to such an algorithm were compared to chromatin immu - noprecipitation results [ 68 ] , but disagreed with previous ﬂuorescence quantiﬁcation [ 2 ] , suggesting that improve - ments are needed to reconcile these methods . One of the difﬁculties with current microscopy methods is to balance excitation and bleaching of the molecules . As a result , most images are collected with > 200 ms exposures . Slimﬁeld ﬂuorescence microscopy uses a specialized sys - tem to generate a compact excitation ﬁeld 100 times the intensity of a normal ﬁeld , allowing a 3 - ms exposure that can be used in combination with stepwise photobleaching to count proteins [ 15 ] . Such characteristics are ideal for live cell imaging to quantify very dynamic structures , and this will likely be a useful technique for many applications , including single - molecule microscopy . Average population behaviors can hide stochastic events , therefore single - molecule techniques are becoming more popular [ 70 ] . Single - molecule microscopy has been developed for proteins that have a very low copy number , especially in bacteria , and the overall picture of single - molecule experiments agrees with the bulk assays while providing a speciﬁc look at stochastic events [ 33 ] . Two similar in vitro methods utilizing single molecules are promising for obtaining stoichiometric information by photobleaching . Colocalization single - molecule spectrosco - py ( CoSMoS ) with dye - conjugated protein tags was used in vitro to examine the stoichiometry and assembly of the spliceosome [ 71 ] .

A revised model of the g - tubulin ring in Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on the ratio of g - tubulin to fluorescent standards . Previously it was expected that 13 g - tubulins should form a ring that serves as a template for the 13 protofilaments in each microtubule , but budding yeast lack many of the components that other eukaryotes use to stabilize the ring structure . ( a ) Microtubule ( MT ) nucleation at a spindle pole body ( SPB , gray rectangle ) from a nucleation platform consisting of 17 g - tubulins ( Tub4 ) . a - and b - tubulin dimers ( red and orange circles ) interact with g - tubulin more strongly than with the MT plus ( + ) end so that nucleation can occur . ( b ) Excess g - tubulin small complexes ( g - TuSC ) might stabilize the g - tubulin ring by overlapping in a spiral . Two possible locations for the Tub4 and Spc98 in excess of the seven complexes ( orange circle and green rod , respectively ) are shown . Reproduced , with permission , from [ 3 ] . Review Trends in Biochemical Sciences November 2012 , Vol . 37 , No . 11 504 allows quantitative determination of stoichiometry and mutually exclusive interaction partners [ 47 ] . Single - molecule biology is an actively growing ﬁeld that might become a standard technique in counting proteins . One advantage of single molecule and super - resolution techniques would be the ability to count molecules directly rather than as part of a collective image , and possibly even distinguish different protein complexes that are within a diffraction limited area . In particular , super - resolution imaging holds promise for counting higher numbers of proteins once the analysis has been improved . Concluding remarks Counting protein molecules globally in cells and locally in speciﬁc complexes is an important step toward generating structural models and numerical simulations of protein complex functions . Protein numbers are also useful to determine the reaction rates in cellular processes and reconstitute multiprotein complexes in vitro . Here , we have given an overview of two popular methods for count - ing proteins using ﬂuorescence microscopy : stepwise photobleaching and ratio comparison to a known standard . Both methods are suitable for any laboratory with a ﬂuo - rescence microscope that wishes to know the stoichiometry of a favorite protein complex . With the genome editing technologies , even previously difﬁcult or impossible quan - tiﬁcations have become simple in organisms that had no efﬁcient gene targeting methods . Each counting method has advantages and disadvantages depending on the ap - plication , and the properties of FPs and functionality of fusion proteins are important considerations for either method . Regardless of the method , protein quantities should be validated by biochemical methods or electron microscopy to ensure the accuracy of interpretations . One interesting outcome of such experiments will be determin - ing if protein complexes have absolute numbers or tolerate a range of binding ( Box 1 ) . Counting proteins using ﬂuo - rescence microscopy is already an active ﬁeld , and super - resolution and single - molecule techniques are promising directions for future improvements .
