ORIGINAL ARTICLE GRIM - 19 mutations fail to inhibit v - Src - induced oncogenesis S Kalakonda 1 , 5 , SC Nallar 1 , 5 , DJ Lindner 2 , P Sun 1 , RR Lorenz 3 , E Lamarre 3 , SP Reddy 4 and DV Kalvakolanu 1 The non - receptor tyrosine kinase Src is a major player in multiple physiological responses including growth , survival and differentiation . Overexpression and / or oncogenic mutation in the Src gene have been documented in human tumors . The v - Src protein is an oncogenic mutant of Src , which promotes cell survival , migration , invasion and division . GRIM - 19 is an antioncogene isolated using a genome - wide knockdown screen . Genes associated with Retinoid - IFN - induced Mortality ( GRIM ) - 19 binds to transcription factor STAT3 and ablates its pro - oncogenic effects while v - Src activates STAT3 to promote its oncogenic effects . However , we found that GRIM - 19 inhibits the pro - oncogenic effects of v - Src independently of STAT3 . Here , we report the identiﬁcation of functionally inactivating GRIM - 19 mutations in a set of head and neck cancer patients . While wild - type GRIM - 19 strongly ablated v - Src - induced cell migration , cytoskeletal remodeling and tumor metastasis , the tumor - derived mutants ( L 71 P , L 91 P and A 95 T ) did not . These mutants were also incapable of inhibiting the drug resistance of v - Src - transformed cells . v - Src downregulated the expression of Pag1 , a lipid raft - associated inhibitor of Src , which was restored by wild - type GRIM - 19 . The tumor - derived mutant GRIM - 19 proteins failed to upregulate Pag1 . These studies show a novel mechanism that deregulates Src activity in cancer cells .

Dephosphorylation of this tyrosine residue sets the stage for autophosphorylation of Y 419 ( human ) / Y 424 ( rodent ) , in the kinase domain and a super - activation of its kinase function . 1 As a result , v - Src escapes negative regulation by Csk . 2 v - Src phosphorylates a number of proteins associated with plasma membrane , cytoskeleton , adherens junctions , proteins involved in cell migration , invasion , proliferation , survival and transcription machinery . 1 Earlier , we employed a genome - wide knockdown screen and discovered the Genes associated with Retinoid - IFN - induced Mortality ( GRIM ) , which conferred a growth advantage to cells following their knockdown . 3 GRIM - 19 was one such gene product , whose overexpression caused growth arrest and / or apoptosis . 4 One of the major targets of GRIM - 19 is transcription factor STAT3 . 5 , 6 STAT3 is transiently activated via tyrosyl phosphorylation by the Janus tyrosine kinases which are recruited to the cytokine - engaged receptors . 7 In tumors , STAT3 is constitutively phosphorylated by activated / mutated oncogenic tyrosine kinases , such as v - Src . 8 , 9 Under these conditions , STAT3 induces the expression of many gene products involved in promoting cell growth , invasion and suppression of apoptosis . 10 We have shown earlier that GRIM - 19 inhibits v - Src - induced cellular transformation , 11 involving remodeling of actin cytoskeleton in a STAT3 - independent manner . 12 Here , we describe three functionally inactivating somatic mutations in the GRIM - 19 gene from primary human oral squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) , which unlike the wild type protein were inefﬁcient at suppressing v - Src - induced cellular transformation , tumor growth , cytoskeletal remodeling and metastatic behavior . The v - Src oncoprotein suppressed the expression level of lipid raft - associated protein Cbp / Pag1 ; an inhibitor of Src . Wild - type GRIM - 19 overrode v - Src - induced repression of Pag1 and rescued Pag1 levels thereby enforcing growth suppression . The tumor - derived GRIM - 19 mutants failed to rescue Pag1 levels . These results identify a novel antioncogene regulatory mechanism and its deregulation in cancers . RESULTS Identiﬁcation of mutations in GRIM - 19 gene from human oral SCC We recently obtained a set of human oral SCC samples from individuals who were long - term tobacco users . Total RNA and genomic DNA were isolated from pathologist - certiﬁed surgically isolated tumors and adjacent normal tissues . Real - time PCR analyses showed GRIM - 19 mRNA levels in some of the tumors was higher compared with their matched normal tissue ( Figure 1a ) . As GRIM - 19 was an inhibitor of cell growth , we were surprised by this inverse correlation between its expression and tumor formation .

Their somatic origin was ascertained by a genomic sequence comparison to a matched normal tissue . These GRIM - 19 mutants were from patients with poorly differentiated lymph node metastases . These mutants L 71 P , L 91 P and A 95 T were cloned into expression vectors to determine their biological effects on v - Src - induced oncogenesis . GRIM - 19 mutants fail to block v - Src - induced cellular transformation To study the biological effects , GRIM - 19 ( mutants and wild type ) expression vectors were transfected into 3Y1 cell line that stably expressed v - Src . After verifying their comparable expression ( Figure 1b ) , we analyzed their effect on v - Src - induced ancho - rage - independent growth in soft - agar medium . Control vector - transfected 3Y1 cells ( EV ) did not form signiﬁcant number of colonies ( 4 25 m m diameter ) while v - Src - expressing cells formed large sized colonies ( ranging from 90 m m to 1mm ) ( Figure 1c ) . In the presence of wild - type GRIM - 19 , fewer colonies formed with an average colony diameter B 70 m m . In the presence of mutant GRIM - 19 proteins , v - Src promoted the formation of several large colonies ( 200 – 900 m m ) . Thus , all three GRIM - 19 mutants failed to inhibit anchorage - independent growth like wild - type GRIM - 19 ( Figure 1d ) . GRIM - 19 mutants are incapable of blocking v - Src - induced cell motility We next tested if these GRIM - 19 mutants had any differential effect on v - Src - dependent motility using a wound scratch model . Conﬂuent monolayers of cells expressing v - Src and GRIM - 19 were scratched to generate a denuded area in the monolayer to permit cell movement . A large number of v - Src - expressing cells moved into the denuded area by 4h , compared with the control vector ( EV ) transfected cells ( Figure 2a ) . Such motility was ablated in the presence of wild - type GRIM - 19 . All three mutants signiﬁcantly ( P o 0 . 001 ) lost their ability to block v - Src - induced motility compared with wild - type GRIM - 19 ( Figure 2b ) . The L 71 P and A 95 T mutants nearly lost all of their capacity to block v - Src in this assay while L 91 P mutant was intermediary between wild - type GRIM - 19 and v - Src . GRIM - 19 mutants do not block v - Src - dependent glucose consumption As most rapidly growing cancer cells utilize glucose for biosynthetic processes , we wanted to determine if GRIM - 19 had an effect on glucose metabolism . Equal numbers of cells expressing v - Src in the absence and presence of GRIM - 19 proteins were grown in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( high glucose ) for 72h and select parameters were assayed in the spent medium . Glucose levels depleted strongly in media from v - Src - expressing cells , which was signiﬁcantly ( P o 0 . 01 ) suppressed in the presence of wild - type GRIM - 19 ( Figure 3a ) . The mutants , however , were unable to prevent glucose depletion . Low glucose levels in the medium correlated inversely with lactic acid levels ( Figure 3b ) . The v - Src - induced rise in lactic acid levels was well controlled by wild - type GRIM - 19 but not by the mutants . These metabolic alterations also reﬂected in corresponding changes in pH of the growth medium ( Figure 3c ) . In light of these observations , we checked for the presence and levels of pyruvate kinase isoforms M1 and M2 in Figure 1 .

M1 is seen in most adult cells while M2 is expressed mainly during embryogenesis . Expression of PKM2 isoform was correlated with a shift towards increased glycolysis and transformed state of cells . 13 In these cells , only Pkm2 transcript was found ( see below ) . When compared with EV , the v - Src - expressing cells had a signiﬁcant increase in Pkm2 levels , which was lowered by wild - type GRIM - 19 ( Figure 3d ) . The mutant GRIM - 19 proteins were unable to suppress Pkm2 transcript levels like the wild type . Pkm2 transcript levels in mutant - expressing cells were comparable to that of v - Src - expressing cells . As an invariant PCR primer was used in this analysis , we ensured that the product observed in these reactions contained only Pkm2 by performing a restriction analysis . The Xho I and Sfo I restriction enzymes sites , present in the alternate exon 9 , are speciﬁc to Pkm1 and Pkm2 transcripts , respectively ( Figure 3e left panel ) . The product was digested only by Sfo I but not by Xho I ( Figure 3e right panel ) . The Kpn I digestion served as marker to show that the product is indeed Pkm . Tumor - derived GRIM - 19 mutants cannot restrain v - Src - induced cytoskeletal remodeling Most normal cells retain a well - spread shape when attached to a substratum , which could be observed in the parental 3Y1 cell line . Although adherent , a greater number of v - Src - transformed cells appeared rounded under light microscope ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . Such a change is required for motility and invasion , by disrupting actin stress ﬁbers . As reported in our earlier study , 12 expression of wild - type GRIM - 19 reverted the cell shape of v - Src - transformed 3Y1 cells similar to that of naive 3Y1 cells . Unlike this , mutant - expressing cells appeared more like v - Src - expressing cells . Therefore , we next examined the inﬂuence of GRIM - 19 and tumor - derived mutants on cytoskeletal reorganization caused by v - Src . Phalloidin staining revealed that actin stress ﬁbers were seen only in control vector - transfected cells . In v - Src - expressing cells they were completely absent and actin was localized to discrete lamellipodium – ﬁlopodium - like structures or densely to rosette - like structures resembling podosomes ( Figure 4a ) . In the presence of wild - type GRIM - 19 , a moderate levels of stress ﬁbers reappeared with a decline in lamellipodium - ﬁlopodium - like structures ( Figure 4a ) . In contrast , mutant - expressing cells had a complete absence of actin stress ﬁbers with several lamelli - podium - ﬁlopodium - like structures . Similar data were observed when cells were stained with cortactin ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . The ability of the same GRIM - 19 mutants to affect cytoskeletal organization was also examined in an oral SCC cell line , HSC3 , which expresses a very low level of GRIM - 19 . Similar to the observations in 3Y1 cells , expression of wild - type GRIM - 19 suppressed lamellipodium - ﬁlopodium - like structures in HSC3 cells ( Supplementary Figure . S4 ) . The mutants , however , lost such ability . Taken together , these observations show that GRIM - 19 ablates v - Src - induced cytoskeletal reorganization and tumor - derived mutants are incapable of exerting such effects . As v - Src induces the phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization , we investigated if GRIM - 19 blocked these events to retain a normal cell shape . Western blot analyses with antibodies that could detect site - speciﬁc tyrosyl phosphorylation in proteins involved in cell adhesion and F - actin regulation , FAK , paxillin and cortactin , showed a signiﬁcant increase in their tyrosyl phosphorylated levels in v - Src - expressing cells , compared with control vector transfected ones . In the presence of wild - type GRIM - 19 , these three proteins were not phosphorylated to a high level ( Figure 4b ) . In contrast , all three mutants lost the capacity to block v - Src - mediated phosphorylation of FAK , paxillin and cortactin ( Figure 4b ) . The L 71 P mutant was completely ineffective at blocking phosphorylation of FAK or cortactin or paxillin , which was either comparable or higher than v - Src - expressing cells while mutants L 91 P and A 95 T moderately inhibited v - Src activity . Thus , among the mutants a differential inhibition of v - Src activity was evident and even the strongest GRIM - 19 mutant was still far less efﬁcient compared with wild - type GRIM - 19 . Lastly , GRIM - 19 mutants also failed to block Src - induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of transcription factor STAT3 and gene expression ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) , unlike the wild - type protein . GRIM - 19 mutants failed to suppress v - Src - induced growth and metastatic spread of tumor cells To address if the mutants lost the capacity to suppress tumor growth in vivo , nude mice were injected with v - Src - transformed cells coexpressing GRIM - 19 ( wild type or mutants ) . At the end of 4 weeks , differences in tumor size among the mutants were clearly observed ( L 71 P 4 L 91 P 4 A 95 T ) that were much bigger compared with wild - type GRIM - 19 , which continued till the end of 7 weeks ( Figure 5a ) . These differences were highly signiﬁcant ( P o 0 . 001 ) . Thus , the mutants were incapable of suppressing v - Src - induced tumor growth in vivo . Next , we addressed if these mutants inﬂuenced metastasis . Cells expressing v - Src and GRIM - 19 were transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing ﬁre - ﬂy luciferase and injected subcutaneously in the lower ﬂank of nude mice . Metastatic spread of cells was monitored using a live imaging system . Control vector - transfected cells did not grow or move from the site of injection while v - Src - expressing cells grew and spread to adjacent areas ( Figure 5b ) . Wild - type GRIM - 19 - expres - sing cells grew slightly but did not spread like v - Src - expressing cells . Metastases were mostly located in the retroperitoneum , with lower frequencies in the vertebral bodies , liver and spleen . The L 71 P and L 91 P mutants , on other hand , failed to block metastatic spread of cells to different parts of the body . The most robust cell Figure 2 .

( b ) Quantitative representation of migration as percent of wound closed . Data represent mean ± s . e . ( n ¼ 6 ) . GRIM - 19 and Src S Kalakonda et al 3197 & 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2014 ) 3195 – 3204 spread was observed with cells expressing v - Src / L 71 P followed by v - Src / L 91 P . The A 95 T expressing cells moved weakly compared with the other two GRIM - 19 mutants , consistent with its relatively better growth - suppressive effects compared with the other mutants ( Figure 5c ) . Mechanism of the anti - v - Src effects of GRIM - 19 To deﬁne mechanism ( s ) of the anti - Src effects of wild - type GRIM - 19 , we ﬁrst assessed Y 416 - Src phosphorylation in cells expressing v - Src and GRIM - 19 . As expected , tyrosyl phosphorylation of Src was readily seen in v - Src - expressing cells compared with the EV cells ( Figure 6a ) . Active Src ( Y 416 - phosphorylated ) levels were the lowest in wild - type GRIM - 19 - expressing cells , while they were highest in L 71 P mutant - expressing cells followed by A 95 T and L 91 P . Thus , the increased tyrosyl phosphorylation of Src substrates in the presence of GRIM - 19 mutants ( see Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S5 ) appears to be due to a failure to block v - Src kinase activity . Initial experiments did not provide evidence for a direct interaction between GRIM - 19 and v - Src ( data not shown ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that GRIM - 19 might activate the expression of a Src inhibitor and the mutants were incapable of doing so . A CSK - binding protein associated with lipid rafts ( Cbp / Pag1 ) could independently suppress v - Src activity as shown by an increased susceptibility of Pag1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts to v - Src - induced transformation . 14 Therefore , we examined if v - Src affected Pag1 expression level and a role for GRIM - 19 in this process . Real - time PCR analysis revealed a strong reduction in Pag1 mRNA level in the presence of v - Src ( Figure 6b ) , which was restored to near normal levels in the presence of wild - type GRIM - 19 . The mutants on the other hand failed to counter the repressive effect of v - Src on Pag1 expression levels . Thus , Pag1 appears to act as a GRIM - 19 - responsive v - Src inhibitor to suppress tumor cell growth . Consistent with the quantitative PCR data , v - Src suppressed Pag1 protein levels . Such repression was countered by wild - type GRIM - 19 and increased it above the Pag1 levels found in EV cells ( Figure 6c ) . To ascertain the role of GRIM - 19 in the upregulation of Pag1 , we transduced v - Src / GRIM - 19 - expres - sing cells with lentiviral particles coding for either scrambled ( Scr ) or GRIM - 19 - speciﬁc short hairpin RNA ( sh - G ) . After ensuring the speciﬁc depletion of GRIM - 19 by sh - G ( Figure 6d ) , we examined if Pag1 levels were affected using a western blot analysis . Indeed , depletion of wild - type GRIM - 19 lead to a decline in Pag1 levels , similar to those found in v - Src - transformed cells ( Figure 6e ) . As expected , depletion of the mutants using the same approach did not signiﬁcantly alter Pag1 levels , because Pag1 is already low in these cells . Consistent with the loss of GRIM - 19 and the consequent loss of Pag1 levels , v - Src activity rose up , that was reﬂected by a rise in the tyrosyl phosphorylation of FAK ( Figure 6f ) . The biological relevance of these observations was ensured by measuring cell motility using a Transwell migration assay ( Figure Figure 3 .

( a , b ) Metabolites present in spent medium were analyzed using Radiometer ABL - 725 ( Diamond Diagnostics , Holliston , MA , USA ) as per the manufacturer’s protocol .

GRIM - 19 and Src S Kalakonda et al 3198 Oncogene ( 2014 ) 3195 – 3204 & 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited 6g ) . As expected , higher numbers of v - Src - transformed cells rapidly moved to the bottom side of the Transwell chambers ( where mitogens are present ) when compared with the EV cells . In the presence of GRIM - 19 cell motility is blocked strongly , which was reversed following the knockdown of GRIM - 19 ( Figure 6g ) . Similar knockdown in mutant - expressing cells did not signiﬁcantly alter cell motility . Taken together , these data indicate an important role for GRIM - 19 in maintaining PAG1 levels to blunt v - Src activity . Lastly , to determine the relevance of Pag1 to GRIM - 19 - mediated inhibition of v - Src , we knocked down Pag1 using a speciﬁc shRNA ( sh - Pag1 ) , expressed from a lentiviral vector . We used v - Src and v - Src / WT cell lines for this study ( Figure 6h ) . The sh - Pag1 knocked down the expression of Pag1 4 82 % , compared with the sh - Scr control in the v - Src / WT cells . As Pag1 is undetectable in the presence of v - Src alone , sh - Pag1 did not affect it in the v - Src cells . Following the loss of Pag1 , v - Src activity and FAK1 phosphory - lation were signiﬁcantly increased in v - Src / WT cells . Figure 6i shows the quantiﬁed data from the western blots . Lastly , the v - Src / WT cells acquired the capacity to form soft - agar colonies in the presence of sh - Pag1 , compared with the control ( Figures 6j – k ) . As expected , sh - Pag1 did not signiﬁcantly affect colony formation Figure 4 . SCC - derived GRIM - 19 mutants cannot completely revert the v - Src - induced transformed phenotype of 3Y1 cells .

GRIM - 19 and Src S Kalakonda et al 3199 & 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2014 ) 3195 – 3204 in the v - Src cells . Thus , loss of either GRIM - 19 or Pag1 produced a similar stimulatory effect on v - Src activity in these cells , indicating a major role for Pag1 in mediating anti - Src activity of GRIM - 19 . DISCUSSION The Src proto - oncogene is hyperactivated either due to mutation / overexpression or due to constitutive activity of mutated growth factor receptors . 1 Src plays a critical role in cell survival 15 and bone metastasis of certain cancers 16 by phosphorylating multiple cellular proteins involved in survival , motility , invasion and cytoskeletal organization . Src activity in normal cells is restrained by a protein tyrosine kinase Csk that phosphorylates the c - terminal Y 530 / 535 residue . 2 , 17 , 18 As mentioned earlier , GRIM - 19 inhibits transcription factor STAT3 . 5 We and others have shown that GRIM - 19 ( RNA and protein ) expression is downregulated in a variety of human primary tumors compared with their matched normal tissue , including kidney , 19 prostate , 20 cervical , 21 lung , 22 gastro - intestinal 23 and brain 24 cancers . Here , we described inactivating GRIM - 19 mutations in SCC . Public databases ( NCBI and ENSEMBL ) have many entries for single - nucleotide variants in GRIM - 19 linked to a sequencing project at the Johns Hopkins University , although no disease annotations are available . Interestingly , mutations in codons ( 71 and 91 for leucine ) described in this study , are also found in these public databases . Both these mutations have lost their ability to block v - Src . These residues are conserved in GRIM - 19 of human , mouse , rat , cow and Xenopus probably indicating an important function . Together , these mutations deﬁne a potential domain within GRIM - 19 required for exerting anti - metastatic functions . Compared with wild - type GRIM - 19 , the mutants displayed moderate to severe loss of antitumor functions ( Figures 2 – 5 ) . Figure 5 .

GRIM - 19 and Src S Kalakonda et al 3200 Oncogene ( 2014 ) 3195 – 3204 & 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited Despite some quantitative differences , the net effect was an inability to block v - Src - induced growth in vivo . Importantly , these mutants could not restore actin stress ﬁbers and failed to block anchorage - independent growth . Focal adhesions typically contain integrins , Fak , Src and actin - anchoring proteins , which are necessary for cell migration . 25 Podosomes are actin - rich cell membrane protrusions that have a role in cell motility . 26 Clustering of podosomes result in rosette - like or belt - shaped structures associated with extracellular matrix - degrading protease activity . 26 Many invasive cancer cells display both these features in addition to high levels of active Src and phosphorylated FAK . An important actin regulator in podosomes is cortactin . Cortactin GRIM - 19 and Src S Kalakonda et al 3201 & 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2014 ) 3195 – 3204 has a higher afﬁnity for the nodes in a branched actin network . 27 , 28 Upon phosphorylation by Src , cortactin loses such afﬁnity allowing actin to be remodeled by other regulators . A high level of phosphorylated cortactin is seen in invasive gastro - intestinal tumors along with high levels of active Src and phosphorylated FAK ; and is often associated with a poor prognosis . 29 Cortactin is frequently overexpressed in a number of metastatic tumors 28 , 30 , 31 and particularly in a high percentage of primary aggressive oral SCCs . 32 Within the head and neck squamous carcinomas , Src / FAK overexpression is associated with poor prognosis . 33 , 34 In Betel - Quid - induced oral SCC , src activation has a prominent role in tumor cell invasion . 35 In other experimental models , combined treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( HNSCC ) , with Src family of non - receptor protein tyrosine kinase and epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , inhibitor yielded better tumor suppression , indicating an important role for Src in tumor growth . 36 Therefore , the metastatic behavior of v - Src - expressing cells ( Figure 6 ) and a critical role played by GRIM - 19 in controlling cancer growth can be envisaged in light of these reports . GRIM - 19 blocked v - Src - mediated tyrosyl phosphorylation of cortactin , a critical event in the remodeling of the actin network . This is a transcription - independent event given there was no change in Cttn levels ( data not shown ) under the conditions of either v - Src or v - Src / GRIM - 19 expression . Thus , GRIM - 19 alters post - translational events involved in cortactin function . We have shown earlier that the anti - Src effects of GRIM - 19 are exerted independently of STAT3 . 12 The growth patterns of v - src / GRIM - 19 mutants are also consistent with relatively higher glucose uptake , compared with wild - type GRIM - 19 protein under the same conditions in vitro ( Figure 3 ) . It has been shown earlier that Src can induce the expression of glucose transporters and hexokinases . 37 – 39 Together , these data show a broader effect of GRIM - 19 on v - Src - induced oncogenic alterations . Most advanced tumor cells depend heavily on aerobic glycolysis 40 to meet their high energy demands . One change that corresponds to the inefﬁcient glucose metabolism in these cells is the rise in Pkm2 transcript following v - Src expression , which was suppressed by wild type , but not by the mutant GRIM - 19 proteins . Interestingly , these cells did not express Pkm1 transcript at all , indicating that in 3Y1 cells PKM2 is the only source of pyruvate kinase . As a v - Src / GRIM - 19 complex could not be detected , we hypothesized that GRIM - 19 might engage an inhibitory protein for suppressing v - Src activity . Although the ﬁrst suspect would be Csk , v - Src lacks its target site ; and cannot explain the inhibitory effects of GRIM - 19 . A novel Src inhibitory mechanism operates through a protein called Csk - binding protein ( Cbp ) , also known as phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid - enriched microdomains 1 ( Pag1 ) . Interaction of Pag1 - Csk , in lipid rafts , promoted Src inactivation by phosphorylating Y 530 / 535 residue . 41 This is an attractive mechanism but cannot explain anti - v - Src effects of GRIM - 19 , because it lacks Y 530 / 535 . However , a recent study has shown that Cbp / Pag1 itself inhibits Src activity independently of Csk . 14 Cbp binds to the SH2 domain of active Src and arrests it in lipid rafts to prevent its oncogenic effects . The Pag1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts are readily transformed by v - Src , which can be suppressed by complementing with Pag1 expression . Importantly , CBP / PAG1 mRNA is downregulated in tumor cells expressing active Src . 14 Consistent with the latter observation , we observed a downregulation of Pag1 in v - Src - expressing 3Y1 cells , which was regained in the presence of wild - type GRIM - 19 ( Figure 6 ) , but not in the presence of the mutant GRIM - 19 . RNA i - mediated knockdown of either GRIM - 19 or Pag1 in cells expressing v - Src / GRIM - 19 resulted in a resumption of v - Src activity , tyrosyl phosphorylation of FAK and increased cell motility and soft - agar colony formation . These observations are consistent with the incompetence of GRIM - 19 mutants to control v - Src and a failure to restore Pag1 expression . In summary , Pag1 re - expression in the presence of GRIM - 19 appears to be a potential mechanism of v - Src inhibition . A portion of GRIM - 19 is also present in mitochondria , 42 where it appears to control electron transport chain activity , 43 which could generate reactive oxygen species . 44 Src family of tyrosine kinases is also regulated by redox control mechanisms through cysteine oxidation . 45 Whether redox activities also contribute to the anti - Src activities of GRIM - 19 , remains to be investigated . v - Src neither affected Pag1 mRNA stability nor the luciferase activity driven by Pag1 promoter in their experiments , which we were able to conﬁrm ( data not shown ) . Recently , v - Src , Ha - Ras and Ki - Ras oncoproteins were reported to suppress Pag1 gene expression through a MAP kinase - dependent histone deacety - lation . 46 Although a role for HDAC1 is suggested in the Pag1 repression , 46 the exact nuclear factors targeted by v - Src are still unknown . It is likely that GRIM - 19 blocks such processes for upregulating Pag1 , given its nuclear presence . 4 There are no known STAT3 - binding sites in the Pag1 promoter ( data not shown ) to suggest that STAT3 potentially inhibits Pag1 transcription and GRIM - 19 reverses it . Furthermore , we have shown that GRIM - 19 inactivation of v - Src activity occurs independently of STAT3 . 12 Future studies are required to resolve the factors targeted by v - Src in repressing Pag1 and how GRIM - 19 affects them . A similar negative regulation of Pag1 occurred in presence of EGF and PDGF . 46 Based on these observations , we believe that GRIM - 19 operates a negative regulatory loop by restoring Pag1 levels , which block the oncogenic effects of v - Src . Lastly , cells expressing v - Src are highly resistant to growth inhibition by chemotherapeutics , which was blunted in cells expressing GRIM - 19 . Mutant GRIM - 19 proteins , described here , were unable to block v - Src - induced chemoresistance suggesting their pathological importance ( data not presented ) . These GRIM - 19 mutants may serve as guides to co - treat tumors harboring them with Src inhibitors in addition to standard chemotherapeutics , to achieve an optimal suppression . However , a systematic large - scale analysis of the relevance of the mutations reported here to primary human oral SCC diagnosis and therapy is still required , which is beyond the scope of current study . MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents Primary antibodies speciﬁc for Myc tag , Src , phospho - Y 416 Src , STAT3 , phospho - Y 705 STAT3 , cortactin , phospho - Y 421 cortactin , paxillin , phospho - Y 118 paxillin ( Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA , USA ) ; Fak , phospho - Y 576 - 577 Fak ( Upstate Biotechnology , Billerica , MA , USA ) ; b - actin ( Sigma - Aldrich , St Louis , MO , USA ) ; Pag1 ( Abcam Inc . , Cambridge , MA , USA ) were used in these studies . Secondary antibodies against anti - mouse and anti - rabbit immunoglobulin G conjugated with Alexa Fluor 750 and 700 ( Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY , USA ) , respectively were used in western blots ( Odyssey system , LICOR , Lincoln , NE , USA ) or immunoprecipitation or immunoﬂuorescence analyses . SCC samples Samples were collected after informed consent under an institutionally approved protocol at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation , Cleveland , OH . Total RNA from tumors and matched normal tissues was converted to complementary DNA and used for PCR with gene - speciﬁc primers ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . The PCR products were sequenced at the University of Maryland Biopolymer / Genomics core facility , Baltimore , MD . The corresponding base changes were veriﬁed by sequencing the PCR products of genomic DNA with speciﬁc primers ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . Cell lines and plasmids An immortalized non - oncogenic rat ﬁbroblast cell line ( 3Y1 ) , was grown in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum . Expression vectors for v - Src and Myc epitope - tagged wild - type GRIM - 19 are described in our previous studies 12 and transfected cells were selected with G418 ( Calbiochem , Billerica , MA , USA ) and puromycin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , GRIM - 19 and Src S Kalakonda et al 3202 Oncogene ( 2014 ) 3195 – 3204 & 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited respectively , for stable expression . Sequencing - conﬁrmed GRIM - 19 mutants from SCC samples were cloned into lentiviral expression vector pLVX - Puro ( Clontech Inc . , Mountain View , CA , USA ) to express as a Myc epitope - tagged protein . Primers used for cloning GRIM - 19 ORF are shown in Supplementary Table S1 . Expression - positive cell pools ( 4 50 colonies per transfection ) were used to generate stable population that were used in all experiments . Lentiviral expression vectors coding for GRIM - 19 - and Cbp / Pag1 - speciﬁc shRNAs were obtained from Open Biosystems Inc . ( Pittsburgh , PA , USA ) . A scrambled shRNA expression vector was used as a control in each case . Lentiviral particles expressing either the shRNAs or the GRIM - 19 mutants were generated as described in our earlier publications . 11 , 12 Immunoﬂuorescence To visualize F - actin network and nuclei , Alexa Fluor 555 - conjugated phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) and DAPI ( Sigma - Aldrich ) were used , respectively . GRIM - 19 ( wild type and mutants ) were visualized by indirect immunoﬂuorescence using anti - Myc immunoglobulin G . Images were captured using a ﬂuorescence microscope ( Olympus BX - FLA , Center Valley , PA , USA ) ﬁtted with a digital camera ( QICAM ) and processed by Q - capture pro 5 . 1 ( Q - Imaging Corporation , Surrey , BC , Canada ) . Cortactin and pY 416 - Src were detected using AF - 555 and AF - 488 tagged secondary antibodies , respectively . Cell growth , motility and gene expression analyses In vitro growth , wound healing , Boyden ( Transwell ) migration and soft - agar colony formation assays were performed as described in our previous reports . 11 Real - time PCR analyses were performed with speciﬁc primers ( Supplementary Table S3 ) using JumpStart SYBR Green Master Mix ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in a Stratagene Mx3005P real - time PCR machine . Expression differences of speciﬁc transcripts were quantiﬁed using the RPL32 or ACTB as the internal controls by the DD C T method . Western blot analyses were performed using the LI - COR Odyssey infrared imager ( LI - COR Biotechno - logy , Lincoln , NE , USA ) and the intensities of bands of interest were quantiﬁed using the software provided by the manufacturer and normal - ized to internal control . Tumorigenic assays These experiments were performed as described earlier 47 under an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) approved protocol . Cells ( 2 (cid:3) 10 6 cells / mouse ) expressing various combinations of GRIM - 19 and v - Src were inoculated into the ﬂank of NCr nu / nu mice ( n ¼ 10 / group ) and growth was measured over a period of several weeks . To monitor the metastatic spread , these cells were Lentivirally transduced to express ﬁre - ﬂy luciferase . Nude mice ( n ¼ 4 / group ) were injected on the lower left ﬂank with cells ( 10 5 / mouse ) subcutaneously . Animals were monitored for metastatic tumor spread using luminescence . Anaesthetized mice were imaged 5min after an intraperitoneal administration luciferin ( 3mg / mouse ) using the IVIS - 100 Imaging System ( Xenogen , Alameda , CA , USA ) . Mice were placed on a heated shelf to maintain body temperature during the entire process . A seven - position ﬁlter wheel allowed imaging in different spectral ranges to measure depth and distribution of the emitted light vis - a ` - vis luciferase - expressing cells . Intensity of the emitted light is shown as a pseudocolor graphic over the black and white image of the animal . Statistical analyses All data were subjected to Student’s t - test with P p 0 . 05 considered signiﬁcant . CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors declare no conﬂict of interest .
