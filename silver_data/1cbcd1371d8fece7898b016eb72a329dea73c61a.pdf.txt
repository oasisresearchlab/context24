Key features of the behavior of F - actin are shared with other well - characterized polyelectrolytes , in particular , duplex DNA . For example , the bundle formation of F - actin by polyvalent cations , including divalent metal ions such as Mg 2 + , has been proposed to be a natural consequence of the polyelectrolyte nature of actin filaments [ Tang and Janmey ( 1996 ) J . Biol . Chem . 271 , 8556 - 8563 ] . This recently proposed model also suggests that weak interactions between F - actin and Mg 2 + ions reflect a nonspecific trapping of counterions in the electric field surrounding F - actin due to its polyelectrolyte nature . To test this hypothesis , we have performed 25 Mg NMR measurements in F - actin solutions . Based on the NMR data , we estimate that the rotational correlation times of Mg 2 + are independent of the overall rotational dynamics of the actin filaments . Moreover , competitive binding experiments demonstrate a facile displacement of F - actin - bound Mg 2 + by Co ( NH 3 ) 63 + . At higher Co ( NH 3 ) 63 + concentrations , a fraction of the magnesium ions are trapped as actin filaments aggregate . ATP also competes effectively with actin filaments for binding to Mg 2 + . These results support the hypothesis that magnesium ions bind loosely and nonspecifically to actin filaments , and thus show a behavior typical of counterions in polyelectrolyte solutions . The observed features mimic to some extent the well - documented behavior of counterions in DNA solutions . Many biological macromolecules are polyelectrolytes , for example , DNA , RNA , charged polysaccharides , filamentous protein assemblies such as F - actin and microtubules , and viruses such as the bacteriophage fd and the tobacco mosaic virus ( TMV ) . In solution , counterions accumulate in the vicinity of polyelectrolytes to balance the local charge . Several useful polyelectrolyte theories have been developed based on the cylindrical - rod cell model , which in its primitive form postulates that electrical charges are distributed uni - formly along the length of the polyelectrolyte ( 1 ) . A specific polyelectrolyte is characterized by a dimensionless linear charge density , Œ , defined as the ratio between the Bjerrum length (cid:236) B and the linear charge spacing b on the polyelec - trolyte . In the classical theory of simple electrolyte solutions , the Bjerrum length is a characteristic interaction distance for ion - pair formation ( 2 ) , defined by where e is the elementary charge , kT is the thermal energy , (cid:15) 0 is the permittivity of vacuum , and (cid:15) is the relative dielectric constant . (cid:236) B is 7 . 1 Å in water at 20 (cid:176) C with a dielectric constant (cid:15) ) 80 . The counterion condensation ( CC ) theory of Manning provides a very useful quantitative description of the key features of polyelectrolyte - counterion interactions ( 3 - 6 ) . The thermodynamic predictions of the Manning theory and the Poisson - Boltzmann theory ( 7 , 8 ) are identical in the limit of infinite dilution . These two theories and other approaches ( 1 , 9 , 10 ) differ in the details of counterion distribution , but are in qualitative agreement on the existence of steep counterion gradients surrounding the polyelectrolyte . Since the key features of our argument are independent of such details , we will discuss our results in terms of the conceptu - ally attractive framework provided by CC theory . According to CC theory , there exists a critical charge density Œ crit ) 1 , above which counterions condense in a thin layer surrounding the cylinder to maintain this critical value . Such a population represents a well - defined fraction ( 1 - 1 / Z Œ ) of the total polyelectrolyte charge , where Z is the valence of the counterion . For example , for duplex DNA , b ) 1 . 7 Å ; thus , Œ ) 4 . 2 , and the total phosphate charge is neutralized to an estimated 77 % by the monovalent cations , or 88 % if sufficient divalent cations are present in solution . Filamentous ( F ) - actin is comprised of actin monomers of molecular mass 42 000 daltons , bound by specific nonco - valent self - assembling sites to form a double - helical filament . Each subunit of an actin filament contains one high - affinity ( K d in the nanomolar range ) divalent cation binding site that is usually occupied by Mg 2 + in vivo . Saturation of this binding site is insufficient to promote actin polymerization , which is driven either by millimolar concentrations of Mg 2 + or else by the order of 100 mM concentrations of monovalent ions . Assuming the amino acid sequence of R - skeletal muscle actin , each monomer subunit retains roughly 11 excess † This work was supported by NIH grants to P . A . J . ( AR38910 ) and W . H . B .

This value is less than the upper limit of 7 . 1 Å but larger than the charge spacing of 1 . 7 Å for DNA , suggesting that although F - actin is not as highly charged as DNA , the phenomenon of counterion condensation is still relevant . Evidence for polyelectrolyte behavior is found in the formation of paracrystalline bundles of F - actin by divalent and polyvalent cations , and it has been demonstrated ( 11 , 12 ) that general features are analogous to the condensation of DNA ( 13 ) . The most convincing demonstration of counterion condensation in DNA solutions derives from studies of cation NMR relaxation dynamics ( 14 ) . It is therefore natural to attempt a more direct demonstration of counterion condensation on the surface of actin filaments via cation NMR studies . The cation of focus in this report is Mg 2 + . Monomeric actin polymerizes to form F - actin in 2 mM MgCl 2 . At higher Mg 2 + concentrations ( > 10 mM ) , the bundling of actin filaments occurs . Interactions between F - actin and Mg 2 + or other divalent metal ions show characteristic polyelectrolyte features . For instance , it has been shown that approximately four or five Mg 2 + , Ca 2 + , or Mn 2 + ions per actin subunit bind interchangeably to F - actin with comparably low affinities in the millimolar range ( 15 ) . In the original report , the data were interpreted in terms of five relatively weak but specific binding sites on each actin monomer . An alternative model is that the divalent metal ions are simply trapped as counterions in the immediate vicinity of actin filaments . According to this model , the metal ions are sequestered near the surface of the filaments , but not necessarily attached to any particular sites . Instead , the cations are free to diffuse along the filaments . This alternative hypothesis based on polyelectrolyte behavior can be tested by 25 Mg NMR experiments . 25 Mg has a spin 5 / 2 nucleus with a nuclear electric quadrupolar moment . The interaction of the quadrupole moment with electric field gradients provides a very effective relaxation mechanism ( 14 , 16 , 17 ) . The observed line shapes are sensitive to the motional and exchange dynamics of the Mg 2 + ions , and thus provide insights into the interaction between Mg 2 + and the actin filaments . MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample Preparations . Monomeric actin was purified according to the method of Spudich and Watt ( 18 ) . Phalloidin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . A stock solution of 1 . 25 mM phalloidin in ethanol was prepared before adding to actin solutions . 25 Mg isotope enriched MgO was purchased from Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( Oak Ridge , TN ) . 25 MgO was dissolved in HCl to prepare a 25 MgCl 2 stock solution . The nonpolymerizing solution contained 2 mM HEPES buffered at pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 5 mM NaN 3 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , and 0 . 1 mM ATP ; a similar solution without ATP was also used as specified . To prepare actin filament solutions , aliquots of the rapidly frozen G - actin solution were first thawed and spun at 10K rpm for 5 min to remove insoluble materials ; then a concentrated MgCl 2 stock solution was added to reach a final concentration of 2 mM in order to polymerize actin . For solutions with high actin concentrations ( 12 mg / mL ) , small amounts of gelsolin were added at a molar ratio of gelsolin : actin ) 1 : 300 to control the length of the polymers , thereby lowering the viscosity and preventing spontaneous phase transition to a nematic liquid - crystalline phase ( 19 ) . The actin solutions were allowed to polymerize for 2 h at room temperature prior to NMR experiments . To allow removal of ATP without depolymerizing actin , 25 (cid:237) M phalloidin was added to the actin solutions after polymerization . The solution was then dialyzed against non - ATP buffer for a few hours . About 2 mL of F - actin solution was used for each NMR experiment . NMR Experiments . All 25 Mg NMR experiments were performed at 30 . 61 MHz on a 11 . 75 T GN - 500 spectrometer using a 10 mm low band probe with temperature control . The temperature of all experiments was 25 (cid:176) C unless specified otherwise . The dead time between the last pulse and the first data point was set to 100 (cid:237) s to avoid acoustic ringing . Longitudinal relaxation times were measured by inversion recovery methods . The quadrupolar relaxation of 25 Mg under the nonextreme narrowing condition is tri - exponential , giving rise to a tri - Lorentzian line shape . The line shape can be analyzed numerically using the Redfield relaxation matrix ( see Ap - pendix ) ( 20 ) . For comparison with experimental results , we have performed such analysis using estimated rotational correlation times ( (cid:244) c ) and effective quadrupole constants ( ł eff ) . Under the conditions of our experiments , ł eff is closely approximated by ł eff ) x p b ł b ( 14 ) , where p b is the fraction of magnesium ions bound to actin and ł b is the quadrupole constant for these bound ions . Simulations of 25 Mg spectra were performed by implementing the methods of Westlund and Wennerstro¨m in Mathematica ( 21 ) . In the simulation , the dynamic shift was introduced , which gives rise to a chemical shift difference between Figure 1B and Figure 1C . A dynamic shift is evident from the asymmetry of Figure 1C , but the precise value of the shift was difficult to determine due to its coupling with phase adjustment . Therefore , these spectra are plotted according to the dynamic shift calculated by spectra simulation . The NMR integrated intensities were obtained by fitting the spectra to multiple Lorentzian line shapes using the spectrum analysis program SPAN in Omega . Spectra are fitted to single or double Lorentzian to give measurements of the spectra and to illustrate the narrow and broad components of the spectra . It is noted that these fitting parameters , however , are not well - defined physical param - eters . RESULTS Binding of Mg 2 + to ATP and Gelsolin . Effects of ATP and gelsolin on 25 Mg 2 + were examined as control experi - ments . Typically , 0 . 1 - 0 . 5 mM ATP or ADP is maintained in actin solutions in order to prevent actin denaturation . Gelsolin is also added to control the lengths of the actin filaments by randomly severing the actin filaments and keeping the rapidly exchanging barbed end of F - actin capped . The addition of gelsolin therefore helps to reduce the solution viscosity and prevent liquid - crystalline formation of F - actin , i . e . , spontaneous alignment of actin filaments , in the course of polymerization , which occurs at slightly above 2 mg / mL for well - purified actin . Control experiments showed that gelsolin at the low concentrations introduced into the F - actin solutions does not 7220 Biochemistry , Vol . 38 , No . 22 , 1999 Xian et al . have a significant effect on the NMR relaxation behavior of Mg 2 + ( data not shown ) . ATP , on the other hand , chelates Mg 2 + quite strongly . Therefore , studies of the binding of Mg 2 + to actin filaments must take into account the binding of Mg 2 + to ATP . Previous studies on Mg 2 + - ATP interactions include the pioneering work of Bryant ( 16 ) using low - field NMR and natural - abundance 25 Mg , and more recently , work by Bock et al . ( 22 ) using modern high - field NMR and isotope - enriched samples . These studies have shown that the presence of ATP has a significant line - broadening effect on the 25 Mg 2 + spectra . We repeated some of these experiments under the conditions used in our 25 Mg - F - actin experiments . The results show that the 25 Mg NMR spectra in ATP - containing buffer solution at 10 and 30 (cid:176) C are both Lorentzian , and that the line width decreases from 39 . 5 Hz at 10 (cid:176) C to 36 . 2 Hz at 30 (cid:176) C . This result indicates that the bound and free Mg 2 + ions are in rapid exchange . The 25 Mg longitudinal relaxation time T 1 measured at 25 (cid:176) C is 9 . 1 ms . If T 1 equals T 2 , the 25 Mg transverse relaxation time , then this would give a natural line width ( 1 / (cid:240) T 2 ) of 35 Hz . This is sufficiently close to the measured inhomogeneity broad - ened line width of 39 Hz to confirm that the motion of ATP - bound Mg 2 + is in the extreme narrowing region . The line broadening of the 25 Mg 2 + spectra by ATP complicates the interpretation of the Mg 2 + - F - actin interaction and is undesir - able . In our initial studies presented here , this problem has been accommodated qualitatively . The feasibility of perform - ing 25 Mg NMR experiments in ATP - free , phalloidin - stabilized F - actin solution is also explored . Binding of Mg 2 + to Actin Filaments . Figure 1 shows the 25 Mg NMR spectra of 2 mM Mg 2 + in the presence of ( A ) 0 . 1 mM ATP and no F - actin , ( B ) 0 . 1 mM ATP and 2 mg / mL F - actin , and ( C ) 0 . 1 mM ATP and 11 mg / mL F - actin . The spectra of Mg 2 + in both actin solutions are clearly multi - Lorentzian . The peak in the spectrum of Figure 1C is slightly shifted upfield from those in Figure 1A and Figure 1B due to a dynamic shift as mentioned previously ( 20 ) . Line shape analysis of these spectra gave correlation times of 21 and 42 ns for the 2 and 11 mg / mL solutions , respectively . The quantity ł eff ) x p b ł b is equal to 0 . 3 MHz for the 2 mg / mL solution and 0 . 96 MHz for the 11 mg / mL solution . If we assume , as predicted by polyelectrolyte theory , that the fractional neutralization of actin negative charge by Mg 2 + is essentially invariant , this implies a decrease in ł b by a factor of about 1 . 4 upon going from a low actin concentration of 2 mg / mL to a high actin concentration of 11 mg / mL . Specifically , if as counterion condensation theory predicts , the fractional charge neutralization r b ) 0 . 82 ( 11 ) , then for a molecular mass of 42 000 daltons and 11 negative charges per actin monomer , p b ) 0 . 11 and 0 . 59 for the 2 mg / mL ( 0 . 048 mM ) and 11 mg / mL ( 0 . 26 mM ) samples , respectively . Hence , the estimated quadrupole constants would be 0 . 92 and 1 . 25 MHz , respectively . Given the approximations of our analysis ( constant p b , isotropic rotational modulation of the quadrupolar interaction ) , the difference between these two numbers is small . Moreover , these values are well within the range anticipated for nonspecific association . ł b was estimated to be 3 . 1 MHz by Berggren et al . ( 23 ) and 0 . 9 MHz by Wright and Lerner ( 36 ) in their studies on DNA - Mg 2 + interactions . Such modest quadrupole constants would not be expected if 25 Mg 2 + were to lose waters of hydration upon binding to F - actin . The rotational correlation times for free Mg 2 + ions are in the picosecond range , and those for the actin filaments are estimated to be in the millisecond range or above ( 24 - 26 ) . Based on the simulation results above , the rotational motions of Mg 2 + are significantly retarded in the presence of actin filaments , yet remain much more rapid than those of the filaments themselves . This result is likewise similar to that found previously for Mg 2 + binding nonspecifically to duplex DNA . Displacement of Mg 2 + and Bundling of Actin Filaments by Cobalt Hexaammine . If the interaction between Mg 2 + and actin filaments is primarily electrostatic , rather than direct and cation - specific coordination to protein carboxyl groups , for example , it should be possible to displace the Mg 2 + ions by other multivalent cations , such as Co ( NH 3 ) 63 + . Figure 2 shows 25 Mg NMR spectra of 2 mM Mg 2 + in an 11 mg / mL ( 0 . 26 mM ) actin solution upon titration with Co ( NH 3 ) 6 3 + . The broad components of the spectra gradually decrease as more cobalt hexaammine cations are added . During the titration , the actin filaments start to form bundles at concentrations of greater than 1 mM Co ( NH 3 ) 63 + ( Figure 2C ) . The bundling is quite extensive at 1 . 5 mM Co ( NH 3 ) 63 + ( Figure 2D ) , and the solution becomes turbid . Table 1 shows the line widths and integrated intensities from single or double Lorentzian fit of the spectra . The difference in the F IGURE 1 : 25 Mg NMR spectra of 2 mM Mg 2 + in a control buffer solution containing 0 . 1 mM ATP ( A ) , polymerized 2 mg / mL actin solution ( B ) , and polymerized 11 mg / mL actin solution ( C ) . All three measurements were performed at 30 (cid:176) C . The solid line in spectrum A is a single Lorentzian line shape . The solid lines in spectra B and C are simulations for an I ) 5 / 2 nucleus , performed as described in the text . The parameters of these simulations are ( B ) ł eff ) 0 . 3 MHz , (cid:244) c ) 21 ns , and ( C ) ł eff ) 0 . 96 MHz , (cid:244) c ) 42 ns . The chemical shift difference between spectra B and C is due to the dynamic shift from the simulation ( see Materials and Methods ) . Binding of Magnesium Ions on F - Actin Biochemistry , Vol . 38 , No . 22 , 1999 7221 composition of the spectra in terms of narrow and broad components is clear . By fitting the presumably tri - Lorentzian line shapes of 25 Mg NMR spectra with bi - Lorentzian ones , the line width of each component does not have well - defined physical meaning because it does not correspond to a specific relaxation rate ( 36 ) , but the effect of line broadening is reflected in Table 1 : I B is weighted by the broad component - ( s ) from the tri - Lorentzian line shape , and it decreases as a result of intensity loss of the broad component ( s ) ; meanwhile I A does not change much until actin bundling occurs , where the broad component ( s ) is ( are ) undetectable and the line shape appears to be single Lorentzian . Figure 3 shows the normalized relative integrated intensities from Table 1 versus the cobalt hexaammine cation concentration . A noticeable change is that the integrated intensities of the 25 Mg 2 + signals decrease markedly as the amount of Co ( NH 3 ) 63 + increases . The total 25 Mg intensity drops more drastically at the point where the actin filaments start forming bundles , as is anticipated if some of the Mg 2 + ions are trapped inside the actin filament bundles and consequently become undetectable by NMR in solution . Another feature of actin bundling , characteristic of poly - electrolyte behavior , is that it can be reversed by addition of excess monovalent cations . When 100 mM KCl is added to the solution of F - actin bundled by 1 . 5 mM Co ( NH 3 ) 63 + and 2 mM Mg 2 + , the solution becomes clear as the actin filament bundles dissolve . Figure 4 shows the unbundling process monitored by 25 Mg NMR . Two changes are observed during the dissolution of the actin filament bundles : first , the 25 Mg line width increases substantially ; and second , the integrated intensity of the 25 Mg signal increases by about 20 % . Both changes are expected if some of the Mg 2 + ions are originally trapped in the bundles , but are released following the dissolution of the actin filament bundles . Titration with ATP . ATP is a multivalent anion that binds to Mg 2 + . For weak electrostatic binding of Mg 2 + to actin filaments , ATP in excess is expected to compete with actin filaments for binding to Mg 2 + ions . Figure 5 shows 25 Mg NMR spectra of 2 mM Mg 2 + in 11 mg / mL actin solution titrated with ATP . As the amount of ATP increases , the line widths of both the narrow and broad components broaden significantly . Eventually the line width narrows again and the line shape becomes single Lorentzian . This concentration dependence may indicate a transition from slow to rapid exchange as the concentration of ATP is increased . As mentioned previously , ATP - bound Mg 2 + ions exchange rapidly with free Mg 2 + ions in the solution . The titration results confirm that ATP is able to compete effectively with the actin filaments for binding to Mg 2 + . Simplifying the Exchange Dynamics : Use of Phalloidin To Allow Remo V al of Free ATP . The presence of ATP in the buffer solution complicates the relaxation dynamics of Mg 2 + , as demonstrated above . An F - actin solution that is free of unbound nucleotide can be obtained by first stabilizing the filaments with stoichiometric amounts of phalloidin and F IGURE 2 : 25 Mg NMR spectra of 2 mM Mg 2 + in polymerized 11 mg / mL actin solution titrated by cobalt hexaammine ( III ) . The concentration of Co ( NH 3 ) 63 + is 0 . 2 mM ( A ) , 0 . 5 mM ( B ) , 1 . 0 mM ( C ) , and 1 . 5 mM ( D ) , respectively .

F IGURE 3 : Relative integrated intensity of 2 mM Mg 2 + in polymerized 11 mg / mL actin solution upon titration with cobalt hexaammine ( III ) cations . The data points are from the 25 Mg NMR spectra displayed in Figure 2 . The sharp decrease of intensity at above 1 mM Co ( NH 3 ) 63 + corresponds well to the apparent aggregation of F - actin . 7222 Biochemistry , Vol . 38 , No . 22 , 1999 Xian et al . then dialyzing the solution against ATP - free actin buffer . Control experiments show no sign of interaction between Mg 2 + and phalloidin ( data not shown ) . Figure 6A shows a 25 Mg NMR spectrum of 2 mM Mg 2 + in a solution of 2 mg / mL phalloidin - stabilized F - actin filaments which is es - sentially free of ATP . For comparison , Figure 6B shows a spectrum when the regular ATP - containing buffer is used . Table 2 shows fitting parameters obtained from double Lorentzian fits of these spectra . It is clear that the broad component of the spectrum in Figure 6A is much narrower than in Figure 6B . Furthermore , the I B : I A ratio is higher for Figure 6B than 6A , because the broad component is more heavily weighted in Figure 6B . One obvious advantage of using phalloidin is that complications due to Mg 2 + exchange with ATP are eliminated . DISCUSSION The 25 Mg NMR experiments reported here provide the first direct demonstration that F - actin binds Mg 2 + in a loose , nonspecific manner that is expected for a polyelectrolyte . Based on the modest values that we have determined for the quadrupole constants , it appears that at least the majority of the F - actin - bound Mg 2 + ions do not lose waters of hydration . The relatively short observed correlation times indicate significant rotational mobility of Mg 2 + on the surface of the F - actin polymer . In contrast , if Mg 2 + were binding to specific sites , then dehydration and significant rotational immobilization would be anticipated . The observed NMR behavior is quite similar to that found for the binding of Mg 2 + and other multivalent cations to duplex DNA ( 14 , 23 , 27 - 30 ) . Although the dynamics of Mg 2 + in actin filament solution can be compared to that in DNA solutions , the two systems differ in some important respects . Unlike DNA , an actin filament at steady state constantly undergoes polymerization and depolymerization at the two distinct filament ends , in a process known as treadmilling ( 31 ) . Moreover , the critical F IGURE 4 : Effect of excess monovalent cations on Co ( NH 3 ) 63 + - induced F - actin bundling . ( A ) 25 Mg NMR spectrum of 2 mM Mg 2 + in polymerized 11 mg / mL actin solution in which F - actin bundling was induced with 1 . 5 mM Co ( NH 3 ) 63 + ( same as Figure 2D but plotted on a different frequency scale ) . ( B ) After about 100 mM K + was added to the above solution which partially dissolved the F - actin bundles . F IGURE 5 : 25 Mg NMR spectra of 2 mM Mg 2 + in polymerized 11 mg / mL actin solution titrated by ATP . The total concentration of ATP which includes the 0 . 1 mM ATP in the buffer solution is 0 . 1 mM ( A ) , 0 . 2 mM ( B ) , 0 . 3 mM ( C ) , 0 . 4 mM ( D ) , and 0 . 6 mM ( E ) , respectively . ( The solution condition of spectrum A was the same as that of Figure 1C . ) F IGURE 6 : ( A ) 25 Mg NMR spectrum of 2 mM Mg 2 + in 2 mg / mL actin solution in the presence of phalloidin . ATP in the buffer has been removed by dialysis . ( B ) 25 Mg spectrum in the presence of 0 . 1 mM ATP from the buffer for comparison ( same as Figure 1B but plotted on a different frequency scale ) . The temperature is 30 (cid:176) C . Binding of Magnesium Ions on F - Actin Biochemistry , Vol . 38 , No . 22 , 1999 7223 concentration of a G - actin pool is quite sensitive to experi - mental conditions , especially changes of salt concentrations . In our experiments , the concentration of Mg 2 + was kept constant at 2 mM , to ensure that actin polymerizes to near completion . However , if the Mg 2 + concentration approaches 10 mM , bundling of actin filaments occurs . The actin concentration is also an important parameter because it strongly affects the solution hydrodynamics which in turn affect the mobility and perhaps the exchange rate of Mg 2 + . Finally , the dynamics of Mg 2 + in F - actin solution may depend on the filament length as well . To control such complications in a systematic manner , the following condi - tions are desirable . First , the solution should be free of ATP . Second , the lengths of the actin filaments should be well controlled by the severing proteins such as gelsolin . Third , the actin filaments should be stabilized so that the filament length does not vary with changes in solution conditions . Based on the results reported here , especially the experiment shown in Figure 6 , it should be possible to satisfy all of these requirements . The behavior of the 25 Mg signal during the bundling transition of actin filaments induced by Co ( NH 3 ) 63 + is quite interesting . The monotonic decrease of the linewidths with increasing amount of the bundling agent indicates that the bound Mg 2 + on the actin surface is being displaced by Co - ( NH 3 ) 63 + . This observation again confirms our hypothesis that at least some of the Mg 2 + ions on the actin filaments are bound nonspecifically and can be displaced by other cations . The loss of 25 Mg intensity during actin bundling , on the other hand , suggests that some of the Mg 2 + ions are trapped as the titration with Co ( NH 3 ) 63 + proceeds and the actin filaments form bundles . The bundling of the F - actin polyelectrolyte requires charge neutralization ( 11 ) , and the trapping of Mg 2 + along with cobalt hexaammine cations may fulfill that requirement . When the bundling transition is reversed by K + , the trapped Mg 2 + ions are released . As a result , the observed 25 Mg intensity recovers and the linewidth broadens , as illustrated in Figure 4 . In Figure 4 , panel A is the spectrum of Mg 2 + in bundled actin filament solution , and panel B shows the 25 Mg signal of the same sample after the actin bundles were partially dissolved by the addition of excess K + . When actin bundling occurs , the broad compo - nents of the 25 Mg NMR signal are severely broadened . Since relaxation of the broadened components occurs during the spectrometer dead time , a large part of the broadened signal is not detected , which may explain the loss of 25 Mg intensity ( Figure 3 ) . Consequently , the detected signal is mainly composed of the narrow components . Even when some of the broad components of the signal are detected , they would appear to be very close to the baseline . An illustration of this is the simulated spectra in the Appendix : as the rotational correlation time increases , the signal first broadens , and then appears to sharpen as the broad components disappear into the baseline . In real experiments , some intensity from the broad components would likely be lost . Another contributing factor is that a part of the bound Mg 2 + ions are released due to actin bundling and give narrow NMR signals . Overall , the 25 Mg spectrum appears to be narrower upon actin bundle formation . When the actin bundles are partially dissolved by K + , Mg 2 + ions are condensed on the filaments again , and part of the 25 Mg signal recovers with a 20 % intensity increase when the broad components of the signal are detected . Consequently , the spectrum appears to be broadened again . Different degrees of line broadening can have different effects on the apparent line shape . A case in point is a comparison between Figure 4 and Figure 6 . In the case of Figure 6 , ATP in the solution causes line broadening , and the line shape appears to be broader than in the absence of ATP . In Figure 4 , however , the trapped Mg 2 + ions experience severe broadening in the actin bundle solution that results in apparently sharp and single Lorentzian line shape . The main difference here is that severe line broadening is usually accompanied by intensity loss , as shown in Figure 3 . Subsequently , Figure 4 displays the effect on line shape when severe broadening is reduced : the lost intensity is partially recovered , and the line shape appears to be broader . The titration of Mg 2 + in actin solution with ATP shows that anionic ATP can compete with actin filaments for binding to Mg 2 + ions , consistent with the idea that Mg 2 + ions bind to actin filament in a loose manner similar to counterion condensation on other polyelectrolytes such as DNA . Eventually the binding to ATP dominates at high concentrations of ATP , and the line shape changes from multi - Lorentzian to broad single - Lorentzian . While a mod - erately weak ( K d ) 10 (cid:237) M ) binding site for ATP on the surface of F - actin has been detected in various studies ( 32 ) , the effects of ATP on actin filament structure ( 33 , 34 ) may relate partly or primarily to the selective depletion of condensed counterions from the surface of the actin filament . It is worth mentioning that a technical concern must be addressed when comparing the signal intensities among the spectra obtained under different conditions . Because of the relatively strong binding of Mg 2 + to actin filaments at the nonspecific sites , part of the broad component of the NMR signal relaxes fast enough to escape detection in solution NMR because of a long deadtime , which results in a certain intensity loss . Therefore , a direct comparison of intensities must be made with caution , and modest intensity losses might be anticipated even for nonspecific binding . Our 25 Mg NMR data will help to clarify the interaction between Mg 2 + and actin filaments under physiologically relevant conditions , for which the Mg 2 + concentrations are typically in the millimolar range and the actin concentrations are in the mg / mL range . The polyelectrolyte behavior of actin filaments may prove crucial to their biological function . The data presented here demonstrate that the interaction of F - actin with Mg 2 + reflects this polyelectrolyte behavior . We have yet to address issues such as the exchange dynamics of Mg 2 + in actin filament solutions . It should also be noted that our solution NMR experiments omit the physiological packing constraints inside cells due to the presence of other proteins that can be potentially important ( 35 ) .

Metal ions play indispensable structural and functional roles in virtually every biological tissue . Mg 2 + , for example , is an essential factor in the activity of more than 300 enzymes . There have been extensive studies on metal ions as specific protein - binding ligands , which play important roles in signal transduction , electron transfer , etc . However , the mechanisms of its interaction with many cytoskeletal elements including F - actin , microtubules , and intermediate filaments have yet to be understood at a fundamental level . Therefore , further NMR studies on the interactions between Mg 2 + and not only actin filaments but also potentially other biological filaments such as microtubules and intermediate filaments are biophysically and physiologically important . APPENDIX Line Shape Simulation of 25 Mg NMR . The NMR line shapes of I ) 5 / 2 and I ) 7 / 2 nuclei and the effect of chemical exchange on line shape are described in detail by Westlund and Wennerstro¨m ( 20 ) . Here we briefly outline line shape analysis for 25 Mg 2 + , a spin I ) 5 / 2 nucleus , as described in Westlund and Wennerstro¨m’s paper . The time derivative of the magnetization vector of I + 1 / 2 elements is Here E is a unit matrix and P is a transverse relaxation matrix in the following form : where J and Q are spectral densities which are expressed as A Fourier transform of eq 1 yields a set of three linear equations : The line shape I ( (cid:246) ) , a sum of three different Lorentzians , can be derived as The line shape I ( (cid:246) ) can be simulated by assuming the rotational correlation time (cid:244) 0 . Chemical exchange will affect the line shape . For a two - site exchange , elements A , B , and C of the relaxation matrix P are modified to include the exchange effect , as described in detail by Westlund and Wennerstrom ( 20 ) . Figure 7 shows simulated line shapes at different (cid:246)(cid:244) 0 values . The progression of the line shape as a function of (cid:246)(cid:244) c shows a sequence of interesting changes : the line width ( half - height width ) first broadens , but the overall line shape maintains Lorentzian ; as broadening continues , the overall line shape appears to be distinctly non - Lorentzian , and the line width becomes narrow again . The asymmetric line shapes are due to dynamic shifts . ACKNOWLEDGMENT Dr . Hong Deng is gratefully acknowledged for helpful discussions and for developing the programs used in this work .
