CTxB binds to the monosialotetrahexosyl ganglioside at the plasma membrane of the target cell and mediates toxin internalization by endocytosis . CTxB induces a local membrane curvature that is essential for its clathrin - inde - pendent uptake . Using all - atom molecular dynamics , we show that CTxB induces local curvature , with the radius of curvature around 36 nm . The main feature of the CTxB molecular structure that causes membrane bend - ing is the protruding alpha helices in the middle of the protein . Our study points to a generic protein design principle for generating local membrane curvature through speciﬁc binding to their lipid anchors . The bacterial cholera toxin is an example of a patho - genic toxin that uses endocytosis for entry into host cells . It is secreted by the Gram - negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae , which is associated with severe diar - rhea and responsible for the death of ~ 10 5 people annually [ 1 ] . The protein is a member of the AB5 toxin families that are comprised of a single catalytic A sub - unit and a membrane binding B subunit ( CTxB ) . CTxB binds to monosialotetrahexosyl ganglioside ( GM1 ) of the plasma membrane of the host cell , which subse - quently drives its internalization into the cell [ 2 ] . CTxB is a homopentameric protein with radius of 3 . 6 nm , which is similar to the B subunit of Shiga toxin ( STxB ) [ 3 ] ( Fig . 1A ) , while the thickness of the protein ( 4 . 1 nm ) is larger than STxB ( Fig . 1B ) . Both CTxB and STxB internalize through clathrin - dependent [ 4 , 5 ] and clathrin - independent endocytosis [ 6 – 10 ] . Charac - teristic for the clathrin - independent endocytosis is the formation of narrow tubular invaginations that are induced by toxic particles binding to the membrane . The formation of tubular invaginations requires a small increment of local curvature generated by toxic pro - teins [ 3 ] and clustering of these particles in a domain [ 11 ] . The small spontaneous curvature of the domain leads to a spontaneous tension [ 12 ] that subsequently drives the membrane tubular invagination . Therefore , a small local protein - induced membrane curvature and clustering of proteins are enough for the formation of tubular invaginations [ 12 ] . Hence , it is of interest to understand how the toxic proteins induce local curva - ture upon binding and how much spontaneous curva - ture they generate .

There - fore , we have performed all - atom molecular dynamics ( aaMD ) simulations to characterize , at the atomistic length scale , the effect of binding of a single CTxB pen - tamer on the lipid bilayer curvature . Materials and methods Each simulated system consists of a single CTxB pentamer and a symmetric lipid bilayer containing 414 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) and 36 saturated or unsaturated GM1 lipids ( Fig . 2 ) . We will refer to the system containing saturated ( unsaturated ) GM1 as S - GM1 / CTxB ( U - GM1 / CTxB ) . Each system was simulated for 1 l s to allow CTxB to bind GM1 lipids . Then , from the last 100 - ns trajectory of each simulation , two different snapshots were chosen as starting conﬁgurations for two replicas that sub - sequently were simulated for 500 ns with new different ini - tial random velocities . The simulations were performed using GROMACS [ 17 , 18 ] and the CHARMM36 force ﬁeld [ 19 , 20 ] with the TIP3P water model [ 21 ] . The CTxB crystal structure was obtained from ref [ 22 ] . Both CTxB and GM1 are charged molecules ( CTxB has 10 positive charges and GM1 has one negative charge ) ; therefore , 26 K + ions were added to neutralize the system . Electrostatic interactions were treated with particle - mesh Ewald ( PME ) with a short - range cutoff at 1 . 2 nm , and van der Waals interactions were switched off between 1 . 0 and 1 . 2 nm .

CTxB induces local membrane curvature temperature and pressure were kept constant at 37 ° C and 1 bar using Nose – Hoover temperature coupling [ 23 , 24 ] and semi - isotropic Parrinello – Rahman barostat [ 25 ] after equili - bration for 50 ns using the Berendsen pressure and tempera - ture coupling [ 26 ] . Bonds containing hydrogen atoms were constrained using the LINCS algorithm [ 27 ] . Finally , the leap frog integrator was used with a time step of 2 fs . Results and Discussion After 1 l s simulation time , CTxB is effectively bound to the bilayer through both direct hydrogen bonding to GM1 ( Fig . 1C ) , as it is predicted by aaMD simulations [ 13 ] and protein crystallography [ 22 ] , and water - mediated hydrogen binding ( Fig . 1D and Movie S1 ) as suggested from the crystal structure [ 22 ] . Figure 3 shows snapshots of a CTxB binding to a membrane containing GM1 lipids inducing an apparent membrane curvature as previously reported [ 13 , 14 ] . However , the snapshots of a curving membrane obtained in an aaMD simulation do not provide numerical or theoret - ical evidence for the local membrane curving ability of CTxB . It may simply signify curvature ﬂuctuations , which is present even in the absence of any proteins attached to the membrane . The quantiﬁcation of the local membrane curvature associated with a bound or imbedded protein involves the time average of an appropriate membrane curvature quantiﬁer [ 3 ] . To quantify CTxB - induced curvature , we ﬁrst obtain the position of the bilayer surface numerically from snapshots during the course of the simulation . From this surface , the local mean bilayer curvature can be found as C 0 ð x ; y Þ ¼ (cid:2) 12 O ^ n , where ^ n is a unit vector that is normal to the bilayer surface . The position of the bilayer surface ( z mem ( x , y ) in Monge representa - tion ) is deﬁned as the arithmetic mean of its monolay - ers’ interface positions ( z up ( x , y ) , z low ( x , y ) ) . They are found by ﬁtting the phosphorus atom coordinates of the DOPC lipids in each monolayer to a Fourier series in two dimensions as z ð x ; y Þ ¼ X N x n ¼(cid:2) N x X N y m ¼(cid:2) N y A nm ð cos ½ p n x þ q m y (cid:3) þ sin ½ p n x þ q m y (cid:3)Þ ; ð 1 Þ where p n ¼ 2 p nL x ; q m ¼ 2 p mL y and L x and L y are the bilayer extensions in x and y directions , respectively . Here , we have used N x = N y = 2 . Note that in this formulation , an inward ( upward ) bending will be represented by a positive ( negative ) curvature . To perform time averaging of the local bilayer cur - vature , we have reﬁned the trajectories of the simula - tions so that the CTxB is always in the center of the simulation box . Figure 4A shows 2D maps of the average curvature ( average over 500 ns ) on the surface of the bilayer for different systems .

For more clariﬁcation , we calculated the radial proﬁle of the membrane curvature as C 0 ð R Þ ¼ 12 p R 2 p 0 C 0 ð R ; u Þ d u , where R and φ are radial distance ( from the center of the protein in the plane of the bilayer ) and azimuth angle in cylindrical coordinates , respectively . As it is shown in Fig . 4B , C 0 ( R ) decreases when R increases and it vanishes at around 3 nm , approximately the dis - tance where GM1 lipids are bound to the protein . The total curvature for a membrane with a periodic boundary condition is zero . To quantify the curvature induced by CTxB , we therefore calculated the local curvature of a bilayer segment under the protein as C 0 ¼ 1 A p R A p C ð x ; y Þ d x d y , where A p is the projected area of CTxB on the membrane plane . Figure 4C shows the local curvature as a function of time for different sys - tems . The time - averaged values of the local curvature are 0 . 032 (cid:4) 0 . 003 and 0 . 024 (cid:4) 0 . 003 nm (cid:2) 1 for differ - ent replicas of the U - GM1 / CTxB system and 0 . 028 (cid:4) 0 . 002 and 0 . 025 (cid:4) 0 . 002 nm (cid:2) 1 for S - GM1 / CTxB replicas . Using the maximum - likelihood princi - ple , the average values are 0 . 028 (cid:4) 0 . 002 nm (cid:2) 1 and 0 . 027 (cid:4) 0 . 001 for U - GM1 / CTxB and S - GM1 / CTxB systems , respectively . These results suggest that CTxB induces local curvature , with the radius of curvature ( inverse of mean curvature ) around 36 nm , which is not inﬂuenced by GM1 lipid chain saturation level . This level of curvature is sufﬁcient for the generation of tubular membrane invaginations [ 3 ] . We previously described that bending of the mem - brane is induced by binding of STxB to its lipid anchors in different orientations and heights with respect to the membrane surface . Most importantly , Gb3 lipid head groups that are bound to the binding site 3 ( at the mid - dle of the binding face of STxB ) are normal to the pro - tein surface , which leads to a lower height of the hydrophobic solvent interface compared to the lipids bound to the sites at the edges of STxB [ 3 ] . However , CTxB has only one type of binding site ( one per mono - mer ) , and therefore , the bound GM1 lipids are all simi - lar in orientation and height . Interestingly , CTxB alpha helices , which are located in the middle of the protein , are protruding away from the binding face of the CTxB with respect to the protein edges ( Fig . 1A – B ) . All CTxB binding sites are located around its edges , so by binding to the membrane , the alpha helices are placing down the lipids underneath compared to the lipids close to the binding sites . This drives the membrane to bend upon binding of the CTxB proteins . In other words , a A C B D Fig . 3 . Snapshot of CTxB inducing local curvature .

CTxB induces local membrane curvature bound CTxB applies two types of vertical forces to the bilayer : an upward force around its edges and a down - ward force through its alpha helices at the protein cen - ter resulting in membrane bending . We therefore suggest that the lengthy alpha helices at the center of the CTxB ring play the role of STxB binding site 3 for generating local curvature . Despite different molecular design of STxB and CTxB , the resulting physical struc - ture induces a local curvature based on a similar princi - ple . Based on these results , we hypothesize that the combination of the positioning of speciﬁc binding units and protein shape provides a new structural motif for curvature generation in membranes , which can be uti - lized by pathogens such as bacterium V . cholerae . The induced local curvature is the result of the interfacial structure of the CTxB – GM1 complex , involving many hydrogen bonds ( Fig . 1C ) . Therefore , we expect that lipid bilayer composition plays the secondary role . However , the lipid composition may be important for CTxB clustering and subsequently tubular invagination ; for example , the presence of cholesterol - induced raft domains enriched with GM1 increases the efﬁciency . According to the model we described here , a reduced number of the bound GM1 lipids results in a lower induced local curvature . This is in line with the observa - tion of diminished uptake efﬁciency of CTxB variants with fewer binding sites ; for example , the smaller local mean curvature results in lower partitioning into high curvature transport vesicle structures such as sorting endosomes [ 28 ] . Previously , it has been observed that CTxB binds to a bilayer in a tilted orientation [ 13 , 14 ] .

CTxB induces local membrane curvature W . Pezeshkian et al . determined three principal axes of CTxB and have cho - sen the axis with the largest moment of inertia as the protein normal orientation . Our results suggest that CTxB binds to the bilayer in both tilted and nontilted conﬁgurations ( Fig . 5A , B ) . In the nontilted conﬁgura - tion , the protein normal vector is nearly perpendicular to the bilayer surface and only has some thermally induced ﬂuctuations , while in the tilted conﬁguration , the protein normal vector has a nonperpendicular ori - entation and at least one of its monomers is not bound to any GM1 lipids . Figure 5C shows the angle between the protein normal and the bilayer normal as a func - tion of time for different systems . The graph shows that for the S - GM1 / CTxB systems , the protein can go from both a tilted to nontilted ( blue curve ) and a non - tilted to tilted ( red curve ) conﬁguration . However , for U - GM1 / CTxB systems , the tilted conﬁguration was observed only for a short period of time ( gray curve ) . The orientation of the bound CTxB on the membrane depends on which hydrogen bonds are saturated . In general , the orientation of the binding residues of the CTxB and head groups of GM1 does not support that all the possible hydrogen bonds become saturated espe - cially when they are constrained to a lipid bilayer sur - face . Therefore , the large binding degeneracy and energetically close binding conﬁgurations can give rise to large varieties of CTxB orientations .
