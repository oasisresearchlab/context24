Emerging advancements in 3D bioprinting technology have shown high potential in the production of bioartificial tissues or organs [ 5 ] , such as the skin , cartilage , and heart . Despite this , a considerable limitation of 3D bioprinting is the production of cell - laden large - volume tissue owing to the difficulty in formation of the hierarchical multi - scale vascular structure in tissue . The vascular structure is significantly important because the vascular tissue in the human body plays a critical role in carrying blood for delivering oxygen and nutrients to cells and removing metabolic waste products from them ; additionally , capillaries improve the contact area of vascular tissue with surrounding tissue . Numerous studies have been conducted for building vasculatures in bioprinted tissues [ 6 ] ; however , they do not successfully mimic the hierarchical multi - scale vascular structure of native tissue , especially capillary branches , due to insufficient mechanical properties of the bioink , and low resolution result from physical limitations such as the printing nozzle size and the resolution of the bioprinter . Without vascular tissue in the bioprinted tissue , nutrients and oxygen can only be supplied to cells by diffusion . However , the diffusion coefficient is usually lowered in the printed construct , due to the presence of hydrogel fibers and cells , and most of the diffused oxygen and nutrients are taken up by cells at the surface of the construct . These combinations cause cell death in the center of the bioprinted tissue , which leads to the failure of its role as a bioartificial organ . One of the most widely used methods for creating an artificial capillary branch is through a biochemical gradient demonstrated using a microfluidic device . In this method , endothelial cells were injected inside fabricated perfusion channels and then allowed to seed . After endothelialization of perfusion channels , endothelial sprouting is induced via the formation of a biochemical gradient associated with angiogenesis [ 7 ] . This method enables the creation of perfusable capillaries that branch out from the endothelialized perfusion channel . Here , we introduce a multi - scale vascularization strategy in bioprinted construct that combines 3D bioprinting technology and endothelial sprouting technique in microfluidic devices . To fabricate a mid - scale vasculature - embedded bioprinted tissue construct , we applied a pre - set extrusion bioprinting technique that has an advantage on fabrication of heterogeneous , multicellular , and precisely structured tissue with a simple extrusion - based bioprinting system [ 8 ] . In a previous study , this technique was used for successfully fabricating a hepatic lobule - like structure with mid - scale vasculature [ 9 ] . Using this strategy , mid - scale vasculature - embedded tissue was printed in the insert of a transwell . Subsequently , a biochemical gradient comprising a cocktail of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate , and sphingosine 1 - phosphate , was generated in the bioprinted tissue to induce endothelial sprouting . As a result , we successfully fabricated a bioprinted tissue embedding multi - scale vascular architecture of mid - scale vasculatures and capillary branches capable of material transfer . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Design and fabrication of precursor cartridges First , for bioprinting tissue constructs embedding mid - scale vasculatures , precursor cartridges with coaxial architecture were designed using the 3D CAD software ( Solidworks 2020 , Dassault Systems , France ) . The 3D CAD file was converted into an STL file to import a 3D printing system . Precursor cartridges were fabricated using a photocrosslinkable resin ( VisiJet SL Clear , 3D Systems , USA ) and a 3D printer ( Projet 6000 , 3D Systems ) . The fabricated precursor cartridges were briefly rinsed with 70 % ethanol and sterilized with ultraviolet light for 1 h before use . 2 . 2 . Cell culture The human dermal fibroblast cell line CCD - 986Sk ( CRL - 1947 , ATCC , USA ) was cultured in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium ( 31980 - 030 , Thermo Fisher Scientific , USA ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum . Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs , C2517A , Lonza , Switzerland ) were cultured in endothelial basal growth medium ( CC - 3156 , Lonza ) supplemented with EGM - 2 SingleQuots ( CC - 4176 , Lonza ) . All cells were cultured in an incubator ( 37°C , 5 % CO 2 ) , and the culture medium was changed every 2 days . 2 . 3 . Preparation of bioink For fabrication of cell - laden tissue , a commercial decellularized extracellular matrix ( dECM ) from porcine skin ( deCelluid - skin , T & R Biofab , South Korea ) was used in this study . The dECM bioink was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , dECM sponge was dissolved in 0 . 5 M acetic acid solution for 72 h at 4°C in 3 wt % . Subsequently , acidic dECM solution was mixed with 10× minimum essential medium ( 11430 - 030 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) at a volume ratio of 8 : 1 . Subsequently , the mixed solution was neutralized with reconstitute buffer ( 1 . 1 g of NaHCO 3 , 2 . 4 g of hydroxyethyl piperazine ethanesulfonic acid , and 7 g of NaOH in 50 mL of distilled water ) . To build a mid - scale vasculature in the printed tissue , an alginate solution was used as a sacrificial hydrogel . Alginic acid sodium salt ( A2033 , Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) International Journal of Bioprinting Multi - scale vascularization strategy for 3D - bioprinted tissue 166 Volume 9 Issue 4 ( 2023 ) https : / / doi . org / 10 . 18063 / ijb . 726 was dissolved in Dulbecco’s phosphate - buffered saline ( DPBS , LB001 - 02 , WELGENE , South Korea ) and stirred for 12 h at 25°C . For printing cells , CCD - 986Sk and HUVECs were detached from the culture dish using 0 . 25 % trypsin - EDTA ( 25200 - 072 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and ReagentPack TM Subculture Reagents ( CC - 5034 , Lonza ) . Next , CCD - 986Sk ( 3 × 10 6 cells / mL ) was mixed with dECM , and HUVECs ( 6 × 10 6 cells / mL ) were mixed with 3 . 5 % alginate solution . The bioinks were centrifuged at 2500 rpm at 4°C for 30 min for removing bubbles . 2 . 4 . Assessment of pre - set extrusion bioprinting parameters We presumed that the geometry of the precursor cartridge and concentration of the alginate solution critically influenced the diameter of the lumen in the bioprinted structure . To analyze the effect of these parameters on lumen diameter , we used cartridges with core region diameters of 1 . 4 , 1 . 7 , and 2 . 0 mm and 3 . 0 , 3 . 5 , and 4 . 0 wt % alginate solutions . The dECM bioink and alginate bioink were loaded in a precursor cartridge , and the bioink - loaded precursor cartridge was placed into a 3 - mL Luer lock syringe with an 18G nozzle . The bioinks were printed into prewarmed DPBS at 37°C using a pneumatic dispenser ( S - Sigma - CM3 - V2 , Musashi Engineering , Japan ) at a pressure of 7 kPa . Subsequently , gelation of the printed fibers was conducted in a CO 2 incubator for 30 min . After gelation , the fibers were sliced using a surgical blade . Images of the sliced fibers were obtained using an inverted microscope ( CKX53 , Olympus , Japan ) with a CMOS camera ( DP74 , Olympus ) and image acquisition software ( CellSence , Olympus ) . The area of the lumen embedded in the printed fiber was measured using ImageJ v1 . 52 software , and the diameter of the lumen was calculated using Equation I : Diameter of lumen Area of lumen = × 4 π ( I ) 2 . 5 . Simulation of diffusion behavior through bioprinted tissue To simulate the diffusion behavior of biochemicals in bioprinted tissues , we selected VEGF as a representative biochemical factor in this study . The diffusion coefficient of VEGF in the gelled dECM bioink was estimated by evaluating the diffusion of 40 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - dextran ( FD40S , Sigma - Aldrich ) , which has a molecular weight similar to that of VEGF ( ≈46 kDa ) . We prepared a gelled dECM block inside the PTFE tube and gently added FITC - dextran solution to establish direct contact with the gelled dECM . The opening of the PTFE tube was covered with paraffin . After 15 min , a fluorescence image of the interface between the dECM bioink and FITC - dextran solution was obtained using a mercury lamp ( U - HGLGPS , Olympus ) , sCMOS camera ( Neo 5 . 5 , Andor , UK ) , and inverted microscope ( IX71 , Olympus ) using a 4× objective lens and FITC filter set . A one - dimensional intensity profile was obtained using the ImageJ software , and the fluorescence intensity of the FITC - dextran solution and the background was normalized to the maximum concentration of FITC - dextran solution and zero , respectively . The concentration profile obtained from experiment was fitted to the following one - dimensional diffusion mathematical equation ( Equation II ) [ 10 ] : c x , t c erfc x 4 D t 0 dECM ( ) = ⋅ ⋅ ⋅       ( II ) In addition , the effective diffusion coefficient of VEGF ( D medium ) in the culture medium was derived from the Stokes – Einstein equation ( Equation III ) : D = k T 6 r medium b h ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ π η ( III ) We estimated that the viscosity of the culture medium ( η ) was not significantly different from that of water . In addition , r h was calculated using Equation IV [ 11 ] : R min = 0 . 066·M 1 / 3 ( IV ) where M is molecular weight . COMSOL Multiphysics Version 5 . 6 ( COMSOL , Sweden ) was used for simulating the time - dependent diffusion behavior of VEGF in bioprinted tissue . The geometry of the bioprinted tissue and surrounding culture medium were modeled using the Solidworks 3D CAD software and imported to the COMSOL software . Transport of the dilute - species module was adopted in this study . The diffusion coefficients of the bioprinted tissue and surrounding culture medium were applied as described above . 2 . 6 . Bioprinting of mid - scale vasculature - embedded tissue Mid - scale vasculature - embedded tissues were printed in a polyethylene terephthalate cell culture insert with a pore size of 8 . 0 μm ( 36106 ; SPL Life Science , South Korea ) to generate a biochemical gradient environment in the bioprinted tissue . Additionally , a pressure - sensitive adhesive film ( 4313663 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) was cut into a ring shape with an inner diameter of 5 mm and an outer diameter of 22 mm and attached to the bottom of an insert to create a diffusion channel for the biochemical cocktail through the bioprinted tissue . This makes the biochemicals diffuse only through the diffusion channel . Subsequently , the film - attached inserts were soaked in 70 % International Journal of Bioprinting Multi - scale vascularization strategy for 3D - bioprinted tissue 167 Volume 9 Issue 4 ( 2023 ) https : / / doi . org / 10 . 18063 / ijb . 726 ethanol for 1 h and subsequently exposed to UV light for 2 h for sterilization before bioprinting . dECM bioink containing CCD - 986Sk cells and alginate bioink containing HUVECs were loaded in the shell and core regions of a precursor cartridge which has core diameter of 1 . 7 mm . Next , a bioink - loaded precursor cartridge was placed into a 3 - mL Luer lock syringe and coupled to a 3D bioprinting system ( 3DX Bioprinter , T & R Biofab ) . The working pressure and temperature for bioprinting were 7 – 9 kPa and 4°C , respectively , and the nozzle was 18G . The tissue was printed into an insert containing 25°C DPBS to a size of 10 × 10 × 1 . 6 mm and a two - layer structure with a diffusion channel in the center . After bioprinting , the tissue was gelated in a CO 2 incubator for 1 h ( Figure S1 ) . Finally , both perpendicular sides with mid - scale vasculatures of the bioprinted tissue were cut using a surgical blade to remove embedded alginate bioink , and DPBS was replaced with EGM - 2 culture medium , as described in Figure 1A . 2 . 7 . Induction of endothelial sprouting The biochemical cocktail was prepared by supplementing EGM - 2 with 75 ng / mL VEGF ( 293 - VE , R & D Systems , USA ) , 150 ng / mL phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( P8139 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , and 500 nM sphingosine - 1 - phosphate ( 73914 , Sigma - Aldrich ) . The biochemical cocktail was added to the underside of the transwell , and normal EGM - 2 medium was added to the insert after 3 days of bioprinting . The bioprinted tissues were cultured in a CO 2 incubator , and the biochemical cocktail and EGM - 2 medium were changed every 24 h . Figure 1 .

Fluorescence staining of bioprinted tissue For assessing cell viability , live and dead staining was performed on the bioprinted tissue . The culture medium was removed from the bioprinted tissue and rinsed three times with prewarmed DPBS . Cells were then stained with calcein - AM ( C1430 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and ethidium homodimer - 1 ( E1169 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) solution for 40 min at 25°C . In addition , the bioprinted tissue was stained with CD31 and alpha - smooth muscle actin for visualizing the vasculatures and the surrounding CCD - 986Sk cells . Briefly , the culture medium was removed from the samples and rinsed with DPBS . The sample was then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde solution for 5 min and washed with DPBS five times . Then , the sample was soaked in a 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 solution for 1 min for permeabilization . For blocking , the permeabilized sample was soaked in a 1 % bovine serum albumin solution for 1 h . Subsequently , the samples were immunostained with CD31 ( ab9498 , Abcam , UK ) and α - SMA ( ab124964 , Abcam ) primary antibodies for 12 h . Alexa Fluor 488 anti - mouse goat ( ab150113 , Abcam ) and Alexa Fluor 594 anti - rabbit goat ( ab150080 , Abcam ) secondary antibodies were stained for 2 h . Finally , the nuclei of cells in the bioprinted construct were stained with Hoechst 33342 ( 62249 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . All fluorescently stained tissues were subjected to laser scanning confocal microscopy ( FV1200 ; Olympus ) . 3 . Results and discussion Figure 1A shows the vascularization strategy used in this study for fabricating bioprinted tissue . The mid - scale vasculatures were created in bioprinted tissue using a pre - set extrusion bioprinting technique ( Figure 1B ) . Subsequently , the bioprinted tissue was cultured for the attachment of cells . Next , we designed an experimental setup for generating a biochemical gradient in bioprinted tissue ( Figure 1C ) . As a result , the endothelial cells formed perfusable capillary branches . Pre - set extrusion bioprinting is a derivative technique from extrusion - based bioprinting method [ 12 ] . The resolution of conventional extrusion bioprinting is lower than other bioprinting method such as jetting - based [ 13 ] and polymerization - based [ 14 ] bioprinting method . For this reason , conventional extrusion bioprinting is not effective for building mid - scale lumen demonstrated in this paper . On the other hand , pre - set extrusion bioprinting has high resolution that is able to build lumen with a diameter of 185 – 445 μm in bioprinted tissue ( Figure 2A and B ) by simply using a coaxial core – shell precursor cartridge , which is a major advantage of pre - set extrusion bioprinting . Also , coaxial nozzle - assisted bioprinting , a common extrusion - based bioprinting method for fabricating vascularized tissue constructs [ 15 ] requires two bioink supply equipment , i . e . , pneumatic dispenser and syringe pump . On the other hand , only a pneumatic dispenser is required for pre - set extrusion bioprinting with coaxial core – shell precursor cartridge to fabricate mid - scale vasculature - embedded tissue . Therefore , fabricating mid - scale vasculature - embedded tissue using pre - set extrusion bioprinting is more cost - effective than coaxial nozzle - assisted bioprinting technique . Furthermore , pre - set extrusion bioprinting can be used for controlling the diameter of the vasculature by adjusting the concentration of the bioink and the geometry of the precursor cartridge . In this technique , the similarity in the shear viscosity of bioinks in a precursor cartridge is important because it determines the co - printability of the bioinks [ 9 ] . Within the co - printable range ( Figure S3 ) , the areal proportion of cross section of the printed construct , fabricated by the pre - set extrusion bioprinting technique , is controlled by adjusting the concentration of each bioink because of the difference in shear viscosity . Considering this possibility , the lumen size in the printed construct was controllable ( Figure 2A ) . When the concentration of the sacrificial bioink ( alginate ) was diluted , a larger lumen was generated , because the viscosity of the alginate solution decreased with dilution ( Figure S4 ) . Another method for changing the lumen size in a printed construct is changing the geometry of the precursor cartridge ( Figure 2B ) . The results showed that a small change in the area of the core region of a precursor cartridge caused large differences in the area of the lumen in the bioprinted construct . This result can be attributed to the geometry of the core – shell precursor cartridge and syringe . The printed tissue construct had high initial cell viability ( Figure 2C ) . Coaxial nozzle - assisted bioprinting sometimes requires a small - diameter nozzle in the core region for fabrication of small vasculature - embedded tissue . When cells in the bioink are extruded through a small - diameter nozzle , they can be damaged by shear stress [ 16 ] . However , in the pre - set extrusion bioprinting process , small - vasculature - embedded tissue can be fabricated by adjusting the concentration of bioink and the geometry of the precursor cartridge without a small - diameter nozzle . Thus , the pre - set extrusion bioprinting technique has a high potential for fabricating tissue constructs with embedded small - diameter vasculatures with high cell viability . In addition , endothelial cells were well attached to the inner surface of the lumen ( Figure 2D ) and proliferated to form mid - scale vasculature in the culture ( Figure 2E ) . Although the pre - set extrusion bioprinting technique is capable of fabricating mid - scale vasculature - embedded tissue , it is not effective for capillary branches in the native tissue . International Journal of Bioprinting Multi - scale vascularization strategy for 3D - bioprinted tissue 169 Volume 9 Issue 4 ( 2023 ) https : / / doi . org / 10 . 18063 / ijb . 726 Therefore , we aimed to generate a biochemical gradient in the bioprinted tissue to induce endothelial cell sprouting and capillary formation . To generate a biochemical gradient in the bioprinted tissue , we modified the cell culture insert to create a diffusion channel and bioprinted tissue in the cell culture insert . A computational fluid dynamics simulation of diffusion was applied to confirm the biochemical gradient environment in the bioprinted tissue . Before the simulation , the effective diffusion coefficient of VEGF through the dECM bioink was derived experimentally ( Figure 3A ) . The effective diffusion coefficient of VEGF through the dECM bioink was 1 . 25 × 10 −11 m 2 / s , as derived from the data shown in Figure 3B , which is within a reasonable range on the basis of previous studies [ 17 , 18 ] .

These effective diffusion coefficients of VEGF were used for simulating the diffusion behavior of VEGF in the bioprinted tissue ( Figure 3C ) . The biochemical gradient environment was generated in the bioprinted tissue and maintained for 24 h as intended ( Figure S5 ) . Furthermore , because the biochemical cocktail and normal EGM - 2 medium were changed every 24 h , the biochemical gradient environment in bioprinted tissue could be maintained for entire experimental periods . We set up two different groups : the first was the experimental group in which sprouting was induced , and the second was the control group , which was cultured with normal EGM - 2 medium ( Figure 4 ) . Endothelial cells on the surface of the lumen proliferated up to days 10 in both groups ( Figure 5A ) . Subsequently , endothelial cells sprouted from the lumen in the experimental group because of the biochemical gradient environment ; however , endothelial cells in the control group did not sprout . Sprouted endothelial cells were located in the interstitial tissue , forming a highly vascularized tissue at days 14 ( Figure 5B ; Videoclip S1 ) . Since the concentration of biochemicals at the center and the peripheral of bioprinted tissue was different ( Figure S5 ) , a different vascularization rate was observed on each part . VEGF is a growth factor related to angiogenesis and vasculogenesis . In addition , phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate promotes the secretion of collagenase from endothelial cells , and sphingosine - 1 - phosphate stimulates the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells [ 7 ] . Owing to the roles of these biochemicals and their gradient environment , endothelial cells not only sprouted from the mid - scale vasculatures in the bioprinted tissue , but also formed perfusable capillary branches with a diameter of 19 . 57 μm ( Figure S6 ) .

Furthermore , some mid - scale vasculatures were interconnected with the sprouted capillary branches ( Videoclip S2 ) . Although we demonstrated a strategy to build multi - scale vascularized tissue , our study has certain limitations that need to be addressed . Since we focused on demonstrating multi - scale vascularization strategy developed in this study , the major factors which influence the degree of vascularization , such as stiffness of matrix , concentration of growth factor , and bioprinted lumen size and its pattern , were not evaluated . To fabricate vascularized tissue more effectively with the strategy developed in this research , these major factors should be investigated through further research . We did not evaluate vascularized tissue function . Although the tissue fabricated in this study has numerous vasculatures , biochemicals can influence the cells in the interstitial tissue [ 19 ] ; therefore , the functionality of cells in interstitial tissue needs to be evaluated . Another challenge for further research is the induction of connections between vasculatures to build the vascular network . The capillaries Figure 4 .

A recent report showed that the direction of a sprouted capillary can be controlled by engineering the stiffness of the bioink [ 20 ] . Upon combining this approach with the strategy suggested in this research , a multi - scale vascular network - like native tissue can be built in the bioprinted tissue . Another challenge is the formation of large - scale blood vessels in the tissue for anastomosis . In organ transplantation , a large - scale blood vessel is sometimes necessary to connect with other blood vessels in the body . Szklanny et al . [ 21 ] reported a tissue fabrication method using large - scale blood vessels for tissue flaps . This method can be applied together with our vascularization strategy for fabricating a tissue with a hierarchical blood vessel structure and a large - mid - small - sized structure . 5 . Conclusion This study successfully demonstrated an advanced multi - scale vascularization strategy through a combination of pre - set extrusion bioprinting and endothelial sprouting by biochemical factors . Using this strategy , we successfully fabricated bioprinted tissue embedded with hierarchical vascular structures consisting of mid - scale vasculatures and capillary branches . In particular , vasculatures , with a diameter of hundreds of micrometers , formed by the pre - set extrusion bioprinting technique , and capillary branches , with a diameter of tens of micrometers , formed by endothelial sprouting , were able to effectively deliver materials , such as oxygen and nutrients to cells . In conclusion , the strategy for multi - scale vascularization in bioprinted tissue demonstrated in this work is expected to become a useful technology for bioartificial tissue or organ development .
