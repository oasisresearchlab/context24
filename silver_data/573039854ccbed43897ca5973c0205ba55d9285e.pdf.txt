Wulf & Rohde , 1995 ; Eriksson & Dittrich , 2007 ) , but many people I talk with ( e . g . policy makers ) are unsure how EUD relates to systems development • User - driven innovation ( von Hippel , 2005 ) as an example for how to contextualize EUD Mutual development 5 / 31 EUD - 2009 , Siegen , 030309 Motivating example • User - driven innovation ( UDI ) in recreational bicycle manufacturing – Active user participation led to new bike series Mutual development 6 / 31 EUD - 2009 , Siegen , 030309 Bicycles models in Norway 1820 - 1972 Notice major changes in some of the models !

Improvement Request was when customers entered requests to the company about extra functionality , bugs - fix etc . , viewed important from the customers’ perspectives . Generalization occurred when a new version of an existing product was released and made available to all customers . Adaptation was when a customer requests for improvement ( s ) to an existing product and the company fulfilled the request for just this customer . Specialization was when the professional developers at the company create in - house builds . Mutual development 23 / 31 EUD - 2009 , Siegen , 030309 Example path from EUD to PSD • Improvement requests ( from one customer ) or tailoring done on a local instance of the product • When communicated back to the company it could lead to an adaptation for this customer • Some adaptations that were rated good ( or possible ) were incorporated in a later release of the product and made available to all customers ( generalization ) Mutual development 24 / 31 EUD - 2009 , Siegen , 030309 Two kinds of development • Speci ﬁ c development ( EUD ) – Development triggered by local events ( automated bug reports , users’ problem description , workarounds , local adaptation , hacks ) some of which may lead to general development ( short term activity ) – Requires communication with professional developers for broad impact • General development ( PSD ) – Development of a product family and planning successive releases ( builds , versions , etc ) of the various software products ( long term activity ) Mutual development 25 / 31 EUD - 2009 , Siegen , 030309 Product line ( general ) development with critical external events ( speci ﬁ c development ) that caused major changes Mutual development 26 / 31 EUD - 2009 , Siegen , 030309 Support tools and “ ﬁ lters” • End - users are encouraged to create proposals ; which are rated as good , possible , or bad by company developers • “Good and possible” proposals will often be included in new versions of the product • Developers create user options , patches , builds , and versions for customers and market Support tools Proposals Accepted New version Aggregation Emergence Mutual development 27 / 31 EUD - 2009 , Siegen , 030309 Multiple generation of support tools C o m p a n y [ Project ] planning tool Installation and run Training Support Social forum Consultancy P r o p o s a l C u s t o m e r Issue , Idea ?
