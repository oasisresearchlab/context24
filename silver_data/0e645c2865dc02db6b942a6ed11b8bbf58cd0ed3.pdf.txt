Abstract We demonstrate that the cell wall of living Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( baker ' s yeast ) exhibits local temperature - dependent nanomechanical motion at characteristic frequencies . The periodic motions in the range of 0 . 8 to 1 . 6 kHz with amplitudes of ∼ 3 nm were measured using the cantilever of an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) . Exposure of the cells to a metabolic inhibitor causes the periodic motion to cease . From the strong frequency dependence on temperature , we derive an activation energy of 58 kJ / mol , which is consistent with the cell ' s metabolism involving molecular motors such as kinesin , dynein , and myosin . The magnitude of the forces observed ( ∼ 10 nN ) suggests concerted nanomechanical activity is operative in the cell .
