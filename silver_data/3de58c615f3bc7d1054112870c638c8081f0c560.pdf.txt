Actin - binding proteins of the actin depoly - merizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin family are thought to control actin - based motile processes . ADF1 from Ara - bidopsis thaliana appears to be a good model that is functionally similar to other members of the family . The function of ADF in actin dynamics has been exam - ined using a combination of physical – chemical methods and actin - based motility assays , under physiological ionic conditions and at pH 7 . 8 . ADF binds the ADP - bound forms of G - or F - actin with an affinity two or - ders of magnitude higher than the ATP - or ADP - Pi – bound forms . A major property of ADF is its ability to enhance the in vitro turnover rate ( treadmilling ) of ac - tin filaments to a value comparable to that observed in vivo in motile lamellipodia . ADF increases the rate of propulsion of Listeria monocytogenes in highly diluted , ADF - limited platelet extracts and shortens the actin tails . These effects are mediated by the participation of ADF in actin filament assembly , which results in a change in the kinetic parameters at the two ends of the actin filament . The kinetic effects of ADF are end spe - cific and cannot be accounted for by filament severing . The main functionally relevant effect is a 25 - fold in - crease in the rate of actin dissociation from the pointed ends , while the rate of dissociation from the barbed ends is unchanged . This large increase in the rate - limit - ing step of the monomer - polymer cycle at steady state is responsible for the increase in the rate of actin - based motile processes . In conclusion , the function of ADF is not to sequester G - actin . ADF uses ATP hydrolysis in actin assembly to enhance filament dynamics . A ctin filaments are a major cytoskeletal component of eukaryotic cells . Rapid changes in the levels of polymeric ( F - ) actin and monomeric ( G - ) actin are involved in the morphological changes of living cells that occur , in a spatially and temporally controlled fashion , in response to environmental signals . Observation of actin dynamics in motile cells indicates that not only are actin filaments actively polymerizing beneath the plasma mem - brane at the leading edge , but also the turnover of actin fil - aments is faster in the lamellipodia than in other regions of the cell ( Condeelis , 1993 ; Fechheimer and Zigmond , 1993 ) . While it is well appreciated that G - actin – binding proteins establish a pool of unassembled actin subunits ( “seques - tered actin” ) that is used in site - directed actin assembly ( Carlier and Pantaloni , 1994 ; Sun et al . , 1995 ) , the molecu - lar mechanisms by which the local changes in critical con - centration and the turnover rate of actin filaments are con - trolled in vivo remain largely unknown . A family of related actin - binding proteins , actin depoly - merizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin 1 , appear as choice candidates for the control of actin - based motility processes in re - sponse to signaling ( for review see Moon and Drubin , 1995 ) . The recently solved tertiary structure of vertebrate ADF shows a folding similar to that of gelsolin segment - 1 , sev - erin segment - 2 , and profilin ( Hatanaka et al . , 1996 ) . These conserved , essential proteins , initially character - ized by their ability to depolymerize F - actin , possess the unique property , among other G - actin – binding proteins , to be regulated by reversible phosphorylation ( Ohta et al . , 1989 ; Agnew et al . , 1995 ) . In all cases investigated , the ac - tivity of ADF / cofilins was inhibited by phosphorylation of a serine in the NH 2 - terminal region . Rapid dephosphory - lation occurs in response to stimuli . Consistently , ADF / co - filins are localized in ruffling membranes and at the lead - ing edge of locomoting cells ( Aizawa et al . , 1995 ) , and overexpression of ADF in Dictyostelium discoideum stim - ulates cell movement ( Aizawa et al . , 1996 ) .

Experiments with transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana indicate that ADF is involved in cell shape maintenance and cell elongation ( Xia , G . , Y . Ishimaru , L . Dong , Y . Hong , S . Ramachandran , A . Cleary , and N . - H . Chua , unpublished data ) . In vitro studies of the interaction of ADF / cofilin with actin have revealed a broad complexity of functional prop - erties . These proteins are identified as G - actin – binding , F - actin depolymerizing proteins ; however , they have been shown to bind also to F - actin and proposed to sever fila - ments in a pH - sensitive fashion . The severing activity is thought to account for the ADF - induced rapid assembly and disassembly of filaments , as well as for the rapid drop in viscosity of F - actin solutions upon addition of ADF ( Yonezawa et al . , 1985 ; Cooper et al . , 1986 ; Maciver et al . , 1991 ; Hawkins et al . , 1993 ; Hayden et al . , 1993 ) . The issue of the preferential binding of ADFs to ADP - or ATP - actin is still controversial ( Hayden et al . , 1993 ; Maciver and Weeds , 1994 ) . The present work addresses the function of ADF in ac - tin dynamics using physical – chemical methods and in vitro motility assays , and Arabidopsis ADF1 is used as a model . We show that the main function of ADF is to increase 25 - fold the turnover rate of actin filaments by changing the kinetic parameters for actin assembly and disassembly in an end - directed fashion . As a result , ADF increases the rate of actin - based motility of Listeria monocytogenes in highly diluted platelet extracts . ADF does not act as a G - actin se - questering protein and does not appear to fragment fila - ments in vitro , but it changes their hydrodynamic parame - ters , which may account for its effects on the viscosity of F - actin solutions . Comparative assays carried out with other ADFs confirm that these proteins all act as “actin dynamiz - ing factors . ” Materials and Methods Proteins Actin , purified from rabbit muscle acetone powder , was isolated as CaATP – G - actin by gel filtration over Sephadex G - 200 in G - buffer ( 5 mM Tris Cl (cid:50) , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 , pH 7 . 8 ) as described ( Carlier et al . , 1996 ) . CaATP – G - actin was converted into MgATP – G - actin by the addition of 0 . 2 mM EGTA and 1 molar equiva - lent (cid:49) 10 (cid:109) M excess of MgCl 2 and used 3 min later . Actin was polymerized by the addition of 1 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 1 M KCl to Mg – G - actin . Gelsolin - capped filaments were obtained by polymerizing Ca - actin without EGTA and 2 mM instead of 1 mM MgCl 2 . MgADP – G - actin was prepared by pre - incubation of MgATP – G - actin with 20 U / ml hexokinase and 5 mM glu - cose ( Pollard et al . , 1992 ) . Actin was labeled by either pyrenyl iodoacet - amide ( Kouyama and Mihashi , 1981 ) or NBD - Cl ( Detmers et al . , 1981 ) . Thymosin (cid:98) 4 ( T (cid:98) 4 ) was purified from bovine spleen ( Carlier et al . , 1996 ) . Spectrin - actin seeds were prepared from human erythrocytes and their molar concentration was determined as described ( Casella et al . , 1986 ) and by titration by gelsolin . Recombinant ADF1 from Arabidopsis thaliana was prepared as fol - lows . A cDNA clone 33D1T7 encoding a protein with homology to the ADF / cofilin family was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Re - sources Center at the Ohio State University . We determined the entire nucleotide sequence of both strands of the cDNA insert . The 0 . 69 - kb cDNA was found to encode a full - length protein designated ADF1 . The cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21DE3 strain by the use of pET 16b vector ( Studier et al . , 1990 ) . Expression of 35 S - labeled ADF1 ( 3 . 5 to 7 Ci / mol ) was performed in M9 minimal medium containing 1 . 5 mCi [ 35 S ] methionine and [ 35 S ] cysteine in the presence of 0 . 2 mg / ml rifampicin , 30 min after the induction of T7 RNA polymerase expression by IPTG . Sequence comparison of ADF1 with other members of the ADF / cofilin family ( actophorin from Acanthamoeba castellanii , yeast , Dictyostelium discoideum , human cofilins ) is displayed in Table I . ADF1 contains 139 amino acid residues , with a molecular mass of 16 , 113 D and an isoelectric point of 7 . 08 . A bacterial extract ( 80 ml ) was dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of DEAE buffer ( 10 mM Tris Cl (cid:50) , pH 7 . 8 , 50 mM NaCl , 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 ) and chromatographed on DEAE cellulose equilibrated in the same buffer . ADF1 was recovered 85 – 90 % pure in the flow - through . The solution was equilibrated in 10 mM Pipes , pH 6 . 5 , 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 , 25 mM NaCl and chro - matographed on SP - trisacryl in the same buffer . ADF1 was recovered 99 % pure in the flow - through . ADF1 was concentrated to 150 – 250 (cid:109) M by ultrafiltration , dialyzed against 5 mM Tris Cl (cid:50) , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 , centrifuged at 400 , 000 g for 15 min , and stored on ice for up to 4 wk without any loss in activity . The concentration of ADF1 was determined spectrophotometrically , using the same extinction coefficient of 0 . 89 mg (cid:50) 1 cm 2 at 278 nm as for actophorin ( Cooper et al . , 1986 ) . Binding of ADF1 to G - actin ADF1 binding to MgATP – G - actin or MgADP – G - actin was assayed by the quenching of fluorescence F of NBD - labeled actin . Experiments were carried out at 20 (cid:56) C , pH 7 . 8 , in a Spex fluorolog 2 spectrofluorimeter ( (cid:108) exc 475 nm , (cid:108) em 530 nm ) using 0 . 3 ml samples of 0 . 8 (cid:109) M G - actin in 4 (cid:51) 4 mm square section cuvettes . The quenching of fluorescence , , was measured at each concentration of added ADF . Data were analyzed using Kaleidagraph software ( Synergy Software , Reading , PA ) and fitted using the following equation : ( 1 ) Q F 0 ( ) F ADF + ( ) – F 0 ( ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - = 1 a - - - 1 K ADF [ ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - , + = Table I .

ADF / Cofilin Increases Actin Filament Turnover 1309 ( 2 ) (cid:97) (cid:53) Q / Q max , Q max is the maximum quenching reached at saturation of G - actin by ADF , [ ADF ] 0 and [ G ] 0 are the total concentrations of ADF and G - actin , respectively , and K is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the G - actin – ADF complex . Binding of ADF1 to F - actin Sedimentation Assay . Samples of 0 . 3 ml containing F - actin and 35 S - labeled ADF at the indicated concentrations were incubated for 10 min to 2 h at most and sedimented at 20 (cid:56) C for 30 min at 400 , 000 g . When barbed ends were capped , a gelsolin / actin molar ratio of 1 : 300 to 1 : 500 was used . The amount of ADF bound to F - actin was derived from radioactivity measure - ments of the amounts of 35 S - labeled ADF present in the samples before centrifugation and in the supernatant of sedimented samples . Superna - tants and resuspended pellets were submitted to SDS - PAGE ( 15 % acryl - amide ) . Coomassie blue – stained gels were scanned ( model Arcus II scan - ner ; AGFA Corp . , Orangeburg , NY ) , and the patterns were compared to those obtained for actin and ADF standards to estimate the amounts of actin and ADF in the pellets and supernatants , using the NIH Image pro - gram . The amount of G - actin in the supernatants was also derived from measurements of the inhibition of DNaseI activity ( Blickstad et al . , 1978 ) . Fluorescence Assay . Samples of fully labeled pyrenyl – or NBD – F - actin at steady state in polymerization buffer were supplemented at time zero with ADF . Changes in light scattering at a 90 (cid:56) angle and fluorescence were recorded simultaneously using the “T” configuration of the Spex flu - orimeter . The excitation monochromator was set at 366 nm for pyrenyl - actin and at 475 nm for NBD - actin . One of the two emission monochro - mators was set at the same wavelength as the excitation wavelength to monitor light scattering . The other monochromator was set at 387 or 530 nm to monitor pyrene or NBD fluorescence , respectively . Polymerization and Depolymerization Assays Kinetics of actin assembly and disassembly were monitored turbidimetri - cally at 310 nm in a spectrophotometer ( model Uvikon ; Kontron Instrs . , Milan , Italy or model Cary 1 ; Varian Techtron , Victoria , Australia ) using 1 - cm path cuvettes thermostated at 20 (cid:56) C . Measurements of initial rate of growth from barbed ends were carried out using spectrin - actin seeds . Assembly was started by adding ADF to preformed Mg – G - actin , followed by the seeds and salt . All buffer solu - tions were thoroughly filtered and degassed before the experiment . The initial rate of growth is : , ( 3 ) where [ S ] represents the concentration of spectrin - actin seeds , and and represent the association rate constants of G - actin and G - actin – ADF , respectively , to the barbed ends . The contribution of the off rate was ne - glected in Eq . 3 because the actin concentration ( 3 . 3 (cid:109) M ) is well above the critical concentration . The concentrations of G - actin and G - actin – ADF can be calculated knowing the values of [ G ] o , [ ADF ] o , and K : . ( 4 ) The value of can be derived from the plot of versus [ G - actin – ADF ] . Since initial rate measurements have been performed at a low per - centage of ADF - actin , the impact of the difference in specific turbidities of F - actin and ADF – F - actin on the value of the rate parameters is minor . Elongation of filaments from the pointed ends was carried out using gelsolin - actin seeds ( 4 (cid:109) M gelsolin (cid:49) 8 (cid:109) M Ca – G - actin in G buffer ) . A so - lution of 6 . 5 (cid:109) M Mg – G - actin was supplemented at time zero with ADF , followed immediately by 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 75 nM CapG ( to cap the potential spontaneous barbed end nuclei ) , different amounts of gelsolin - actin seeds , and salt . The optimum amount of CapG was experimentally determined to efficiently cap spontaneous barbed end nuclei but avoid nucleation of new pointed ends , which we found to occur at concentrations of CapG above 150 nM .

DNaseI binds tightly to monomeric actin ( Blickstad et al . , 1978 ) and to the pointed end subunits ( Podolski and Steck , 1988 ; Weber et al . , 1994 ) ; hence , the effect of ADF on the rate of depolymerization from the barbed ends specifically can be measured . Depolymerization of F - actin from the pointed ends was induced by adding 26 (cid:109) M T (cid:98) 4 and ADF as indicated to a solution of 3 . 5 (cid:109) M F - actin polymerized in the presence of 7 nM gelsolin . The amount of T (cid:98) 4 added is low enough for this protein to act only as a G - actin sequestering agent . Measurement of the Treadmilling Rate of Actin Filaments The rate of filament turnover at steady state ( treadmilling ) was monitored by the decrease in fluorescence of (cid:101) ADP bound to F - actin after addition of a chase amount of ATP . Since ADP is nonexchangeable on F - actin ( Pollard et al . , 1992 , and references therein ) and since its fluorescence is sixfold higher in the actin - bound than in the free state , the rate of fluores - cence decrease is a true measurement of filament turnover . (cid:101) ATP – G - actin ( 15 (cid:109) M ) , prepared as described ( Valentin - Ranc and Carlier , 1989 ) , was polymerized in the presence of 30 (cid:109) M free (cid:101) ATP . Samples of F - (cid:101) ADP - actin were preincubated with the desired amounts of ADF for 20 min . The change in fluorescence of (cid:101) ADP ( (cid:108) exc (cid:53) 350 nm ; (cid:108) em (cid:53) 410 nm ) was re - corded versus time after addition of 1 mM ATP . Identical results , but with a lower time resolution , were obtained using a sedimentation assay ( 400 , 000 g for 15 min ) of [ 3 H ] ADP – F - actin and measuring the increase in [ 3 H ] ADP in the supernatant at different time intervals after the onset of the ATP chase . ATP Hydrolysis Measurements in F - actin Solutions at Steady State Ca – G - actin ( 16 (cid:109) M ) was equilibrated in G buffer containing 0 . 2 mM (cid:103) 32 P - labeled ATP , converted into Mg – G - actin , and polymerized by addi - tion of 1 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 1 M KCl . ADF was added at 15 min , when steady state was reached . Acid labile [ 32 P i ] resulting from ATP hydrolysis was monitored by extraction of the phosphomolybdate complex ( Carlier et al . , 1986 ) during assembly and at steady state over a period of 5 h . Actin - based Motility Assay of Listeria monocytogenes in Platelet Extracts Platelet extracts were prepared ( Laurent and Carlier , 1997 ) by sonication of a suspension of washed unstimulated platelets in 10 mM Tris Cl (cid:50) , pH 7 . 5 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA ( 8 (cid:51) 10 9 (cid:54) 1 (cid:51) 10 9 cells / ml ) followed by centrifugation at 100 , 000 g for 35 min , 4 (cid:56) C . The amount of G - actin in the extracts was 35 (cid:109) M , as derived from the DNaseI inhibition assay . The amount of T (cid:98) 4 was 61 (cid:109) M as derived from HPLC ( Carlier et al . , 1996 ) . The amount of unassembled actin and T (cid:98) 4 being 200 and 320 – 500 (cid:109) M , re - spectively , in platelets ( Weber et al . , 1992 ) , the cytoplasm was about six - fold diluted in the extracts . The extract was supplemented with extraction buffer , 5 mM ATP - Mg , 6 mM DTT , 3 . 25 (cid:109) M rhodamine - labeled G - actin , oxygen scavengers ( Isambert et al . , 1995 ) , methyl cellulose and ADF as indicated , and 10 8 bacteria / ml . The final dilution of the platelet cytoplasm could be varied by changing the volume of extraction buffer present in the motility assay . Sample preparation , fluorescence microscopy observation , and video recording of the formation of comet tails and bacteria propul - sion were carried out as described ( Marchand et al . , 1995 ) . 10 – 15 mobile bacteria were recorded per sample to derive the average rates and tail lengths . It was checked that ADF1 binds rhodamine - actin used in the mo - tility assay . A 25 % quenching of the fluorescence of rhodamine – F - actin occurred upon binding ADF1 . Sedimentation Velocity of Actin Filaments in the Analytical Ultracentrifuge—Effects of ADF1 and Gelsolin Solutions of F - actin containing different amounts of ADF or gelsolin were centrifuged at 20 (cid:56) C at 20 , 000 rpm in an analytical ultracentrifuge ( model Optima XLA ; Beckman Instrs . , Fullerton , CA ) . Scans were recorded at 295 nm at 4 - min intervals . The average sedimentation coefficients of fila - ments present in the different samples were compared . Control samples for severed filaments were obtained using gelsolin at a 1 : 100 , 1 : 500 , or 1 : 1 , 000 ratio to actin . on A p r il 20 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published March 24 , 1997 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 136 , 1997 1310 Results ADF1 Binds ADP – G - actin with a 100 - fold Higher Affinity than ATP – G - actin under Physiological Ionic Conditions The fluorescence of NBD – G - actin was partially quenched upon binding ADF . Therefore , this parameter was used to determine the values of the equilibrium dissociation con - stant of the ADF – G - actin complex under a variety of con - ditions . The extent of quenching of NBD fluorescence versus ADF concentration displayed a saturation behavior , con - sistent with the formation of a tight 1 : 1 complex between G - actin and ADF . Under physiological ionic conditions ( 0 . 1 M KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7 . 8 ; Fig . 1 ) , ADF bound to MgADP – G - actin with an affinity ( K d (cid:53) 0 . 1 (cid:109) M ) two orders of magnitude higher than MgATP – G - actin ( K d (cid:53) 8 (cid:109) M ) . The quenching of NBD fluorescence was slightly higher in the ADP - bound complex ( 32 (cid:54) 2 % ) than in the ATP - bound complex ( 27 (cid:54) 2 % ) . At low ionic strength , the af - finity of ADF for MgATP – G - actin was higher than at physiological ionic strength ( K d (cid:53) 0 . 08 (cid:109) M ) and only three - to fourfold lower than for MgADP – G - actin ( K d (cid:53) 0 . 025 (cid:109) M ) . Binding constants at different ionic strength are displayed in Table II . Identical values of the binding con - stants ( within 20 % ) were derived from kinetic measure - ments of the inhibition of nucleotide exchange on G - actin by ADF1 ( data not shown ) . The Different Binding of ADF1 to ADP – G - actin and ADP – F - actin Causes the Partial Depolymerization of Filaments Sedimentation assays of the binding of 35 S - labeled ADF to F - actin ( Fig . 2 a ) in the presence of 0 . 1 M KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7 . 8 , show that ADF binds tightly to F - actin with a sigmoidal saturation curve . In agreement with oth - ers ( Nishida et al . , 1984 ; Hawkins et al . , 1993 ; Hayden et al . , 1993 ; Moon et al . , 1993 ) , one molar equivalent ADF per F - actin subunit was found in the pellet at saturation by ADF . The amount of F - actin decreased to a limited extent upon increasing the concentration of ADF . At saturating amounts of ADF , a constant amount of ADF – F - actin ( 1 : 1 ) coexisted at steady state with a constant amount of unas - sembled actin . Identical data were obtained when ADF was added to preassembled F - actin and when actin was assem - bled in the presence of ADF . The concentration of unas - sembled actin reached at saturation by ADF was indepen - dent of the total concentration of actin and was 1 . 7 – 2 (cid:109) M at pH 7 . 8 . The binding behavior of ADF was qualitatively identical to the above in a range of pH from 6 . 5 to 8 . 3 ( Fig . 2 , b and c ) . At pH 6 . 5 , the amount of unassembled actin at steady state at saturating amounts of ADF was 1 . 2 (cid:54) 0 . 2 (cid:109) M ; it reached 3 . 5 (cid:54) 0 . 5 (cid:109) M at pH 8 . 3 . The partial depolymerization of actin by ADF is not in agreement with the behavior expected for a G - actin se - questering protein , which should eventually depolymerize F - actin totally in a concentration - dependent fashion ( Car - lier and Pantaloni , 1994 ) . Rather , the results suggest that ADF - actin complex copolymerizes with actin and that a new steady - state concentration of unassembled actin is es - tablished in the presence of ADF . The sigmoidicity of the binding curves of ADF to F - actin is consistent with the ob - servation of the gel patterns ( Fig . 2 ) showing that addition of a small amount of ADF ( (cid:122) 1 (cid:109) M ) to an F - actin solution essentially causes depolymerization of F - actin ( hence bind - ing of ADF to G - actin ) , while very little ADF binds to the remaining filaments . At higher concentrations , ADF binds to F - actin . The sigmoidal curve therefore does not result from the cooperative binding of ADF to F - actin as previously thought ( Hayden et al . , 1993 ) but reflects the preferential interaction of ADF with G - ADP - actin over F - ADP - actin . In the presence of BeF 3 (cid:50) , a P i analog that binds to F - ADP - actin subunits and reconstitutes the F - ADP - P * transition state of ATP hydrolysis on F - actin ( Carlier , 1991 ) , ADF neither bound appreciably to F - actin nor depolymerized it , in agreement with other reports ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ; Ma - civer and Weeds , 1994 ) . The binding of ADF to phalloidin – F - actin was very low . In conclusion , the affinity of ADF for F - actin , as well as for G - actin , is strongly dependent on the bound nucleotide and much higher for the ADP forms of both G - and F - actin . The binding of ADF to gelsolin - capped filaments was examined next . A steady - state concentration of unassem - bled actin of 3 . 5 (cid:54) 0 . 3 (cid:109) M was found at saturation by Figure 1 .

ADF / Cofilin Increases Actin Filament Turnover 1311 ADF . In the presence of ADP , a true critical concentra - tion of 4 . 5 (cid:54) 0 . 5 (cid:109) M for assembly of ADF - ADP - actin was found at saturation by ADF , both in the presence and ab - sence of gelsolin . This value is threefold higher than the critical concentration for assembly of ADP - actin . Detailed balance therefore implies that the equilibrium dissociation constant for binding of ADF to ADP – F - actin subunits be threefold higher than to ADP – G - actin , i . e . , 0 . 3 (cid:109) M , as de - scribed by the following thermodynamic square scheme : , where K 1 and K 2 refer to the propagation constants ( i . e . , the critical concentrations for polymerization ) of ADP - actin and ADF - ADP - actin , respectively , and K 3 and K 4 are the equilibrium dissociation constants for binding of ADF to G - ADP - actin and F - ADP - actin , respectively , with K 1 (cid:63) K 4 (cid:53) K 2 (cid:63) K 3 . All data are summarized in Table II . Interaction of ADF with F - actin : Fluorescence and Light Scattering Measurements The mechanism by which ADF causes partial depolymer - ization of F - actin was addressed in kinetic experiments . Since excess ADF causes depolymerization of a maximum of 1 . 7 (cid:109) M actin , it was interesting to compare the effects of ADF addition ( 0 . 7 molar equivalent to actin ) to either a low or a high amount of F - actin , at which depolymeriza - tion occurs to very different extents . Typical curves are shown in Fig . 3 .

Similarly , the addition of ADF to 15 (cid:109) M F - actin ( Fig . 3 b ) caused a 10 % decrease in light scattering , also consistent with 1 . 7 (cid:109) M depolymerized actin . The changes in fluorescence did not quantitatively cor - relate with the changes in light scattering . A rapid large decrease was followed by a slower decrease . The slow phase was kinetically consistent with the decrease in light scattering . At all F - actin concentrations , the amplitude of the large rapid fluorescence decrease varied linearly with ADF and reached 95 % quenching at a 1 : 1 molar ratio of ADF / F - actin ( Fig . 3 d ) . This implies that the rapid binding of ADF to F - actin is linked to the quenching of pyrenyl – F - actin fluorescence to the level of G - actin and is followed by a slower partial depolymerization . The linear depen - dence of quenching on ADF concentration indicates that the ADF binds with high affinity ( K a (cid:46) 10 6 M (cid:50) 1 ) to F - ADP - actin . The fast binding was noncooperative , which confirms our interpretation of the sigmoidal binding curves ( Fig . 2 ) obtained when ADF binding is assayed by sedimentation after the slow relaxation to a new steady state . Identical results were obtained using NBD - labeled actin . The fluo - rescence of NBD – F - actin was quenched , upon binding ADF , to a level corresponding to 70 % of the fluorescence of NBD – G - actin . When ADF was added to partially labeled pyrenyl – F - actin , the fluorescence change was more complex ( Fig . 3 c ) . The rapid and slow decreases were then followed by a slow recovery to a higher stable limit , in agreement with others ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ; Aizawa et al . , 1995 ) . A straight - forward interpretation is that ADF binds rapidly to both labeled and unlabeled F - actin subunits and then slowly re - distributes from the labeled to the unlabeled F - actin sub - units , with fluorescence recovery . This kinetic behavior is generated when the rate constants for association to unla - beled and labeled actins are similar , but the higher affinity for unlabeled actin is linked to a lower dissociation rate constant . A similar behavior is displayed by myosin sub - fragment - 1 binding to partially labeled actin and was re - cently quantitatively analyzed with the same mechanism ( Blanchoin et al . , 1996 ) . No changes in fluorescence nor light scattering were observed when ADF was added to phalloidin – F - actin or to F - ADP - BeF 3 - actin , which con - firmed the observations made in Fig . 2 . Effect of ADF1 on the Kinetics of Actin Polymerization The results presented above demonstrate that ADF modi - fies the steady state of actin assembly and point to the need to understand how the kinetics of assembly / disas - sembly at the barbed and pointed ends of the filaments are affected by ADF . Preliminary experiments ( not shown ) in - dicated that , in agreement with data in Fig . 3 , the time courses of actin assembly followed simultaneously by light scattering and either NBD - or pyrenyl - actin fluorescence were no longer kinetically correlated in the presence of ADF because of the quenching of fluorescence that occurs upon binding of ADF to F - actin during polymerization . Since fluorescence of labeled actin cannot be used reli - ably to monitor actin assembly in the presence of ADF , turbidimetry was used as an alternative tool . Fig . 4 shows the effects of ADF on the spontaneous assembly of Mg - ATP - actin ( a ) and Mg - ADP - actin ( b ) . In both cases , ADF increased the rate of assembly and the maximum extent of turbidity change . In the simple case of reversible polymer - ization of ADP - actin , monotonic time courses of assembly correspond to the copolymerization of ADP - actin and ADF – ADP - actin . In the presence of ATP , the overshoot kinetics suggest that partial depolymerization of ADF – F - actin oc - curs consecutive to some kinetic barrier . We know that : ( a ) Pi release after ATP hydrolysis associated with actin polymerization is a slow process ( t 1 / 2 (cid:53) 2 min ) that takes place on the filaments after actin assembly ( Carlier , 1991 ) ; and ( b ) ADF binds to ADP - actin with a 100 - fold higher af - finity than to ATP - actin . Hence , the most plausible explana - tion accounting for the different kinetics in ADP and ATP is that in the presence of ATP , ADF binds to F - actin and promotes its partial depolymerization only after Pi has been released . The final steady state concentration of un - assembled actin in the presence of ADF ( 2 (cid:109) M at this pH ) is therefore established via overshoot kinetics . In the pres - ence of inorganic phosphate , which maintains the fila - ments in the F - ADP - Pi state , the overshoot was abolished but the ADF - induced increase in initial rate of assembly was still observed . The polymerization time courses are not consistent with fragmentation of filaments by ADF because they do not exhibit the acceleration and symmetric shape around the half - polymerization time point characteristic of such a process , which has been observed and mathematically ana - lyzed ( Carlier et al . , 1985 ) . The validity of the turbidity change as a measure of the mass amount of assembled actin in the absence and pres - ence of ADF is illustrated by the linearity of the critical concentration plots shown in Fig . 4 c . The extent of turbid - ity change per unit mass of assembled actin was 1 . 65 - fold Figure 4 . Effects of ADF1 on the polymerization of ATP - and ADP - actin .

ADF / Cofilin Increases Actin Filament Turnover 1313 greater for ADF – F - actin than for F - actin . This figure is quantitatively consistent with the increase in mass per unit length of filaments decorated by ADF . Indeed , the turbid - ity is expected to be proportional to the square of the mo - lecular mass per unit length of the polymer ( Carlier et al . , 1994 ) . Assuming that the structure factor of F - actin fila - ments remains unchanged , in a first approximation , when ADF is bound to F - actin , the ratio of the specific turbidity of ADF – F - actin and F - actin is expected to be equal to the ratio of the square of the molecular mass of the polymeriz - ing unit , which in this case is equal to ( 58 / 42 ) 2 (cid:53) 1 . 9 , in rea - sonable agreement with the experimental value of 1 . 65 . The steady - state concentrations of monomeric actin , as derived from the plot shown in Fig . 4 c , were 0 . 15 and 2 . 5 (cid:109) M in the absence and presence of a saturating amount of ADF , respectively , consistent with the sedimentation data . Note that the turbidity reached at steady state ( Fig . 4 a ) in the presence of different concentrations of ADF is fully consistent with the sedimentation data ( Fig . 2 a ) and the increase in specific turbidity of F - actin upon binding ADF ( Fig . 4 c ) , as follows . Low concentrations of ADF essen - tially promote depolymerization of F - actin ; hence , fila - ments are eventually poorly decorated by ADF at steady state , and the final turbidity is low . At higher concentra - tions of ADF , the final turbidity is higher because of the increased binding of ADF to F - actin . ADF1 Increases the Association Rate Constant of Actin to Barbed Ends , Not to Pointed Ends of Actin Filaments To determine the association rate constant of actin - ADF to barbed ends , the effect of ADF on the initial rate of growth from spectrin - actin seeds was examined . Data ( Fig . 5 a ) were analyzed using Eqs . 3 and 4 ( Materials and Methods ) . The association rate constant of G - actin – ADF complex to barbed ends appeared to be 12 (cid:54) 3 – fold higher than that of G - actin . This result may seem puzzling since the association rate constant of actin to barbed ends ( 10 7 M (cid:50) 1 (cid:63) s (cid:50) 1 ) has been shown to be diffusion - limited ( Drenk - hahn and Pollard , 1986 ) . It is plausible that , upon binding to G - actin , ADF induces a dipolar moment in the actin monomer , which modifies the charge distribution at the in - terface of G - actin with the barbed end , thus enhancing long - range electrostatic interactions and steering the asso - ciation reaction . As an example , the electrostatically as - sisted association of barnase to barstar has recently been described ( Schreiber and Fersht , 1996 ) and modeled ( Ja - nin , 1997 ) . This interpretation was challenged by testing the shielding effect of ionic strength . In a low ionic strength F buffer ( 1 mM MgCl 2 ) , ADF – G - actin associated 20 - fold faster to barbed ends than G - actin . At high ionic strength ( 0 . 4 M KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 ) , the steering effect of ADF was abolished . Specifically , no change was observed in the rate of filament elongation when the concentration of ADF - ATP - G - actin , calculated using Eq . 4 with the experimen - tally determined value of K d at 20 (cid:109) M ( Table I ) , repre - sented up to 40 % of the total amount of G - actin in the elongation assay . The strong ionic strength dependence of the kinetic facilitation of actin association to barbed ends by ADF therefore supports the view that electrostatic forces are involved in its action . The effect of ADF on the rate of actin association to the pointed ends ( Fig . 5 b ) was evaluated using gelsolin - actin seeds to nucleate pointed end growth . The effect of ADF was much less pronounced than at the barbed ends . The presence of the overshoot indicated that partial depoly - merization induced by ADF occurs at least partly from the pointed ends . If the increase in the rate of elongation from spectrin - actin seeds had been due to a severing effect of ADF rather than an effect on the association rate , then the same severing action would have occurred when filaments were Figure 5 . ADF1 increases the rate of filament growth at the barbed end , not at the pointed end of actin filaments . ( a ) Barbed end growth . The initial rate of elongation of G - actin ( 3 . 3 (cid:109) M ) was measured turbidimetrically at the indicated concentrations of spectrin - actin seeds , and the following concentrations of ADF ( (cid:109) M ) : (cid:106) , 0 ; (cid:110) , 0 . 5 ; (cid:100) , 1 ; (cid:115) , 1 . 5 . ( Bottom inset ) Typical raw data at 0 , 1 , and 1 . 5 (cid:109) M ADF .

( b ) Pointed end growth . The assembly of 6 . 5 (cid:109) M MgATP – G - actin was initiated by the addition of 20 nM ( 1 and 3 ) or 4 nM ( 2 and 4 ) gelsolin - actin seeds in the absence ( 1 and 2 ) and in the presence ( 3 and 4 ) of 3 (cid:109) M ADF . The reaction was started by addition of salt . The turbidity was measured before the addition of salt and subtracted from the polymerization time course . The dead time was 5 s . on A p r il 20 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published March 24 , 1997 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 136 , 1997 1314 induced to grow from their pointed ends . Clearly the data eliminate this possibility . ADF1 Increases the Rate of Filament Depolymerization from the Pointed Ends , Not from the Barbed Ends Depolymerization of gelsolin - capped actin filaments ( 3 . 5 (cid:109) M F - actin ) was induced by addition of ADF at different con - centrations and monitored turbidimetrically ( Fig . 6 a ) . The critical concentration at the pointed ends being increased up to 3 . 5 (cid:109) M by ADF , addition of ADF to capped F - actin promotes , in these conditions , total depolymerization . The initial rate of depolymerization then truly represents the off rate at the pointed ends . Identical time courses were obtained in the additional presence of T (cid:98) 4 used as a se - questering agent ( not shown ) . The rate of depolymeriza - tion , in absorbance U / min , was increased up to 36 (cid:54) 5 – fold by ADF , compared with a control in which total depoly - merization was promoted by T (cid:98) 4 . Once corrected for the 65 % higher specific turbidity of ADF – F - actin as com - pared to F - actin ( Fig . 4 c ) , the rate of depolymerization is actually increased 22 (cid:54) 3 – fold by ADF . The ADF concen - tration dependence of the increase in rate reflected the high - affinity 1 : 1 binding of ADF to ADP – F - actin . The effect of ADF on the rate of depolymerization from the barbed ends was examined next using DNaseI ( Fig . 6 b ) . The rate of DNaseI - induced depolymerization was unaf - fected by ADF in saturating amounts . From the turbidity data , the initial rate of disassembly was about 100 nM sub - units / s , consistent with a population of filaments of 2 . 5 - (cid:109) m average length depolymerizing at a rate of 12 subunits / s ( Pollard and Cooper , 1986 ) . After capping the barbed ends of the same F - actin solution by 120 nM CapG in the pres - ence of 0 . 2 mM Ca 2 (cid:49) ions ( Carlier et al . , 1996 ) , depolymer - ization from the pointed ends was induced by T (cid:98) 4 in the presence and absence of ADF . The same 22 - fold increase in rate of depolymerization as in Fig . 6 a was observed . If the increase in the rate of depolymerization from the pointed ends ( Fig . 6 a ) had been due to a severing action of ADF , creating a large number of uncapped , rapidly de - polymerizing filaments , then the same severing action would have caused a large increase in the rate of DNaseI - induced depolymerization from the barbed ends ( Fig . 6 b ) . Clearly the data again eliminate this possibility . Also note that if ADF had a weak severing efficiency of 0 . 1 % ( Hawkins et al . , 1993 ) , a stoichiometric effect ( Fig . 6 a ) would not be observed . In conclusion , the effects of ADF on actin as - sembly and disassembly are end specific . ADF1 Increases the Turnover of Actin Filaments and the Steady - State ATPase of F - actin The rate of treadmilling at steady state was derived from the rate at which the nonexchangeable , F - actin – bound (cid:101) ADP was replaced , after an ATP chase , by nonfluorescent ADP as a result of subunit flux through the filaments ( Wegner , 1976 ) . The decrease in fluorescence of (cid:101) ADP proceeded linearly with time , at all concentrations of ADF , for over 60 % of the total renewal of F - (cid:101) ADP - actin , suggesting that under physiological conditions monomer – polymer exchange is essentially due to treadmilling ( Brenner and Korn , 1983 ) . A very large increase in the rate of treadmilling was in - duced by ADF . The increase was concentration dependent ( Fig . 7 ) and reached a maximum of 25 - fold , which corre - sponded to an average flux of 2 subunits / s . At higher con - centrations of ADF , an apparent decrease in the treadmilling rate was recorded , most likely as a result of the inhibition by ADF of (cid:101) ADP dissociation from G - actin after its disso - ciation from the pointed ends . The exchange of nucleotide on G - actin then becomes rate limiting in the monomer – polymer exchange process . The 25 - fold increase in tread - milling rate is consistent with the 22 - fold increase in the dissociation rate at the pointed ends . The steady - state ATPase of F - actin provides an alterna - tive measure of filament turnover . The ATPase of F - actin was greatly increased by ADF . ATP hydrolysis was linear Figure 6 . ADF1 increases the rate of depolymerization from the pointed ends , not from the barbed ends of actin filaments . ( a ) De - polymerization from the pointed ends .

At the maximum , (cid:122) 0 . 8 ATP was hydrolyzed per second per average filament of 8 – 10 - (cid:109) m length . After 18 h of incuba - tion at 20 (cid:56) C , at least 90 % of the ATP was found hydro - lyzed in samples containing 5 – 10 (cid:109) M ADF . ADF1 Increases the Rate of Listeria Propulsion in Platelet Extracts The actin - based movement of Listeria monocytogenes can be reconstituted in human platelet extracts ( Laurent and Carlier , 1997 ) . Assays were carried out increasing the dilution of the extract in extraction buffer supplemented with rhodamine - actin . As documented in detail elsewhere ( Laurent and Carlier , 1997 ; Table I ) , the rate at which ac - tin “clouds” are formed around the bacteria as well as the rate of propulsion of the bacteria increase upon increasing the dilution of the extracts , reach a maximum , and then de - crease at high dilution , most likely because of the limiting amounts of one or several of the cellular components nec - essary for efficient movement . At a 48 - fold dilution of the platelet cytoplasm , Listeria moved at an average steady rate of 4 (cid:109) m / min , i . e . , 2 . 5 - fold lower than the maximum rate observed at a lower dilution , and displayed actin tails of 16 - (cid:109) m length . The fact that both the length of the actin tails and the rate of movement are constant over several hours indicates that movement of Listeria results from a steady state of actin assembly , in which the measured rate of actin polymerization , which drives the movement ( The - riot et al . , 1992 ) , is equal to the rate of the kinetically limit - ing step in the steady - state cycle . The ADF / actin molar ra - tio is 0 . 1 in platelets ( Davidson and Haslam , 1994 ) ; hence , the concentration of endogenous ADF might have been at most 200 (cid:63) ( 0 . 1 ) / 48 (cid:109) M (cid:53) 0 . 4 (cid:109) M in the assay . When added to the diluted platelet extract , ADF1 increased the rate of actin - based motility in a concentration - dependent fashion and caused a shortening of the length of the actin tail ( Ta - ble III ) . In the presence of 0 . 75 (cid:109) M ADF1 , the bacteria moved twice as fast and the actin tails were fourfold shorter . Typical pictures are shown in Fig . 8 . No effect of ADF on the rate of movement was observed when it was added to less diluted extracts in which Listeria moved at 10 (cid:109) m / min . These results indicate that in the highly diluted extracts the rate of movement is low because of the limited amounts of endogenous ADF . Platelet extracts appeared to be more convenient than Xenopus egg extracts for mon - itoring the movement of Listeria at high dilution , presum - ably because platelets are specialized cells for actin - based motility and contain high amounts of actin - binding proteins . The effects of ADF on the motility of Listeria are con - sistent with our biochemical data showing that ADF in - creases the rate of depolymerization at the pointed ends , which is the kinetically limiting step in the turnover rate of actin filaments and therefore limits the rate of assembly at the barbed ends at the surface of the bacteria . The short - ening of the tail is consistent with results ( Marchand et al . , 1995 ) indicating that filaments are capped in the tail body and depolymerize from their pointed ends . We checked that capping proteins are functional in platelet extracts by measuring the shift in critical concentration of a pyrenyl - labeled F - actin solution upon addition of increasing amounts of platelet extracts . The critical concentration of the pointed ends was established as soon as 5 % in volume of the plate - let extract ( corresponding to a 120 - fold dilution of the plate - let cytoplasm ) was added to F - actin . As the tails grew shorter and the bacteria moved faster upon addition of ADF , the trajectories of the bacteria be - came less straight , and the frequent changes in direction made it more difficult to measure the rate of propulsion with accuracy . When high concentrations of ADF were added , the actin tails never reached a size ( i . e . , acquired a friction coefficient ) sufficient to support unidirectional move - ment . The lower limit size of the actin tail required to start movement was of the same magnitude as the length of the bacterium , i . e . , 1 (cid:109) m . Data are summarized in Table III . Does ADF1 Fragment Filaments In Vitro ? In agreement with reports on other ADFs ( Cooper et al . , Figure 7 . ADF1 increases the treadmilling and steady state ATP - ase rates of F - actin . The rate of treadmilling ( (cid:104) ) was derived from the decrease in fluorescence of (cid:101) ADP bound to F - actin ( 13 (cid:109) M ) after a chase of ATP . The rate of ATP hydrolysis ( (cid:100) ) was mea - sured under the same conditions ( 13 . 5 (cid:109) M F - actin ) in polymeriza - tion buffer containing 0 . 17 mM (cid:103) [ 32 P ] ATP . A rate of 0 . 014 (cid:109) M / min was measured in the absence of ADF . Table III .

No recovery of viscosity with time was observed . Even after overnight incubation , the viscosity of ADF – F - actin solutions ( 20 (cid:109) M , pH 6 . 5 – 8 . 0 ) remained low , while the F - actin controls were solid gels . The rapid decrease in viscosity has generally been at - tributed to the severing activity of ADF . However , the fact that ADF affects the rates of assembly / disassembly differ - ently at both ends ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) cannot be simply ac - counted for by a severing activity . Consistently , electron microscopy observation of negatively stained samples of ADF - decorated filaments ( Fig . 9 ) failed to display a 20 - fold decrease in filament length , which should have been observed to account for the kinetic data in Figs . 5 a , 6 a , and 7 . The electron micrographs of ADF1 - decorated actin filaments show the same features as those obtained by Ohta et al . ( 1984 ) , i . e . , a thickened appearance and con - torted shape , but no appreciable change in average length . To get more insight into the putative severing activity of ADF1 , the sedimentation velocity of samples of F - actin ( 15 (cid:109) M ) containing different concentrations of ADF or gelsolin was examined in the analytical ultracentrifuge at pH 7 . 8 in physiological ionic strength buffer . The apparent sedimentation coefficient of F - actin at 15 (cid:109) M was 60 (cid:54) 5 S , and increased to 93 (cid:54) 7 S in the presence of 20 (cid:109) M ADF . In contrast , it decreased to 53 (cid:54) 5 and 32 (cid:54) 2 S in the pres - ence of gelsolin at molar ratios to actin of 1 : 500 and 1 : 100 , respectively . These data show that actin filaments severed by gelsolin sediment more slowly , while they sediment faster in the presence of ADF . In an additional experiment , the sedimentation velocity of F - actin ( 7 . 7 (cid:109) M ) containing gelsolin at a 1 : 1 , 000 molar ratio to actin and increasing amounts of ADF was examined . Average sedimentation coefficients of 76 (cid:54) 4 , 96 (cid:54) 5 , and 121 (cid:54) 6 S were mea - sured for F - actin samples containing 0 , 4 , and 8 (cid:109) M ADF , respectively . The concentration dependence of the sedi - mentation coefficients of F - actin and ADF – F - actin was derived from these data , considering the 3 (cid:109) M difference in concentration of assembled actin in the presence and absence of ADF . Extrapolation to zero actin concentra - tion yielded the values of S 0 , 20 of 96 (cid:54) 6 and 135 (cid:54) 10 S for F - actin and ADF – F - actin in the presence of gelsolin at a 1 : 1 , 000 molar ratio to actin .

ADF / Cofilin Increases Actin Filament Turnover 1317 tence length of 7 – 8 (cid:109) m ( Isambert et al . , 1995 ) ; hence , they can be considered as rods in this experiment where their average length is 3 (cid:109) m . The sedimentation coefficient of rods is given by the following equation ( Garcia de la Torre , 1992 ) : , ( 5 ) where M is the molecular mass of the polymer , L its length , and d its diameter . v is the partial specific volume , (cid:114) the density , (cid:104) the solvent viscosity , and N the Avo - gadro’s number . For very long rods ( L (cid:64) 10 d ) , (cid:103) takes the value 0 . 386 . The ratio of the molecular masses of ADF – F - actin and F - actin subunits being 1 . 38 , the ratio of the aver - age diameters of the corresponding filaments is (cid:53) 1 . 17 ( assuming that the binding of ADF to F - actin thickens the filament but does not increase its length ) . The ratio of the sedimentation coefficients of ADF – F - actin and F - actin can be calculated using Eq . 5 , in two cases , using an average filament length of 3 , 000 nm ( fixed by gelsolin ) and values of 8 and 9 . 4 nm for the diameters of F - actin and ADF – F - actin : ( a ) If ADF does not frag - ment filaments , the ratio of the sedimentation coefficients is 1 . 38 [ ln ( 3 , 000 / 9 . 4 ) (cid:49) 0 . 386 ] / [ ln ( 3 , 000 / 8 ) (cid:49) 0 . 386 ] (cid:53) 1 . 35 , which is in good agreement with the experimental value of 135 / 96 (cid:53) 1 . 4 . ( b ) If ADF had a weak severing activity of 0 . 1 % ( Hawkins et al . , 1993 ) , the addition of 20 (cid:109) M ADF to a 15 (cid:109) M F - actin solution would generate 20 nM fragments , thus decreasing the average length by about threefold . It can then be calculated that the sedimentation coefficient would be decreased by 18 % if ADF only severed filaments without binding F - actin , as was proposed to occur at pH above 7 . 0 . It would be increased by only 10 % if ADF both severed and bound tightly to F - actin . In conclusion , although the drop in viscosity of F - actin upon binding ADF1 is suggestive of severing of filaments , electron microscopy and sedimentation velocity fail to confirm the fragmentation hypothesis . Other Members of the ADF / Cofilin Family Are Biochemically Similar to ADF1 from A . thaliana and Increase the Turnover Rate of Actin Filaments by the Same Mechanism Yeast cofilin , Acanthamoeba actophorin , and human ADF ( destrin ) were tested using the assays described in this paper . The following results were obtained : All three proteins bound to F - ADP - actin , causing a quenching of fluores - cence of NBD - and pyrenyl - labeled F - actin . In physiologi - cal ionic strength buffer , pH 7 . 8 , all three proteins partially depolymerized F - actin like ADF1 . The concentration of unassembled actin at steady state was 0 . 7 and 1 . 2 (cid:109) M for the yeast and ameba proteins and 3 (cid:109) M for human ADF , values close to the one found for ADF1 ( 1 . 8 (cid:109) M ) . The pH dependence was similar too . The steady - state ATPase of F - actin was increased up to 12 - fold by all three proteins . Turbidimetric kinetic measurements showed that these three proteins increased the rate of disassembly of F - ADP - actin from the pointed end . Therefore , the enhancement of actin dynamics is a common feature to all ADF / cofilins , and it has the same mechanistic origin , which indicates that all ADFs / cofilins might have the same function in ac - tin - based motility in different species .

Ameba , yeast , and vertebrate ADFs also increased the rate of assembly at the barbed end to different extents , which reflected their different affinities for ATP – G - actin . ( Actophorin did not increase the rate of actin assembly at the barbed ends , while yeast and human ADFs did . ) All three proteins behaved very similarly to ADF1 turbidimet - rically and showed overshoot polymerization time courses . In conclusion , interesting quantitative differences in the biochemistry of these different ADF / cofilins are worth in - vestigating further , using the quantitative assays that we set up here , to understand how their primary function in the enhancement of actin dynamics may be modulated in different species . Discussion The recombinant ADF1 protein from A . thaliana studied here exhibits phenomenological properties similar to other members of the ADF / cofilin protein family . Since it has been largely documented that the native and recombinant ADF / cofilins from other species have identical properties , we can be reasonably confident that the native plant pro - tein is functionally identical to the recombinant protein . The new data reported here lead us to propose a compre - hensive interpretation of the present and previous results obtained on a variety of ADF / cofilin variants . A novel view of the mechanism of action of ADF is proposed , according to which the main functional property of ADF in actin - based motility is to increase the turnover rate of actin fila - ments at steady state . This function is mediated by the large increase in the rate of depolymerization from the pointed ends , which is the rate - limiting step in the steady - state monomer – polymer cycle of actin in the presence of ATP . The detailed biochemical analysis of ADF1 function has been made possible by the development of new tools ( flu - orescence quenching , turbidimetry ) and by the use of ki - netics to understand the mechanism of action of ADF in a quantitative fashion . This kind of study required the use of muscle actin , which is easily available and whose kinetics have been extensively studied . While the physiological rel - evance of our approach may be questioned , our results com - pare well with previous works in which muscle actin has been used to study ADF / cofilins from amebas ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ) , yeast ( Moon et al . , 1993 ) , starfish oocytes ( Sutoh and Mabuchi , 1989 ) , plant ( Lopez et al . , 1996 ) , and vertebrate nonmuscle tissues ( Nishida et al . , 1985 ; Yonezawa et al . , 1985 ; Moriyama et al . , 1990 ; Hayden et al . , 1993 ) . To temper the concern one might have about the relevance of such in vitro studies , one should note that the biochemical proper - ties of Acanthamoeba actophorin ( Cooper et al . , 1986 ) and D . discoideum cofilin ( Aizawa et al . , 1995 ) remained the same when these proteins were assayed with homologous actin . The lethality of yeast cofilin - minus mutants was rescued by mammalian cofilin or ADF ( Iida et al . , 1993 ) . However , actophorin reacts differently with muscle and ameba actins when Ca 2 (cid:49) is bound to actin ( Mossakowska and Korn , 1996 ) . ADF Does Not Act as a G - actin Sequestering Protein In a broad pH range ( 6 . 5 – 8 . 3 ) , the ADF / cofilins assayed here all cause only partial depolymerization of F - actin . Our understanding of ADF function therefore is concep - tually different from the one derived from previous in vitro work ( for review see Sun et al . , 1995 ) . Thus far , ADF from various sources has been described as a protein which completely depolymerized actin in a 1 : 1 molar ratio at pH 8 . 0 ( Nishida et al . , 1985 ; Yonezawa et al . , 1985 ) , which is the exact definition of a high - affinity G - actin se - questering protein . This conclusion was derived from ex - periments carried out at actin concentrations of 3 (cid:109) M at most . Our data are in perfect agreement with those ; how - ever , our interpretation differs because we observe that at higher actin concentrations , ADF fails to further depoly - merize actin . ADF binds to both F - and G - actin , hence the ADF - actin complex should be considered as another poly - merizable rather than a sequestered form of actin . This conceptual difference is important in the analysis of the data , as follows . The action of a G - actin sequestering protein is usually visualized by a shift in critical concentration plots , from which the value of its affinity for G - actin can be derived . The exclusive binding of the protein to ATP – G - actin is im - plicit in this calculation ( Carlier and Pantaloni , 1994 ) . This analysis cannot apply to ADF , which binds to both G - and F - actin , preferentially in their ADP - bound forms . There - fore , the ADF - induced shift in critical concentration plots that have been routinely observed ( Hawkins et al . , 1993 ; Hayden et al . , 1993 ) led to an incorrect estimate of the equi - librium dissociation constant for binding of ADF to ATP – G - actin because they were interpreted within a G - actin se - questering activity of ADF . In addition , a strong bias would be introduced in the interpretation by assuming that the changes in fluorescence of labeled actin reflect changes in the amount of F - actin , which we have seen is not the case . The pH dependence of the F - actin / G - actin ratio in the presence of ADF1 , like for other ADFs , is simply quanti - tative and does not reflect a switch in function from an F - to a G - actin – binding activity of ADF upon increasing pH . Although ADF tightly binds ADP – G - actin , it cannot be considered as an ADP – G - actin sequestering protein ei - ther . Indeed , in the presence of ADP , ADF also binds to F - actin and a true polymerization equilibrium of ADF - ADP - G - actin into ADF - ADP - F - actin is established , with a critical concentration of 4 (cid:109) M ( see the thermodynamic square scheme presented in Results section ) . The Enhancement of Actin Dynamics by ADF Cannot Be Accounted for by Severing of Filaments The severing of filaments by ADF / cofilins was originally proposed for the following reasons : It was first noticed that ADF accelerated actin polymerization and promoted a rapid drop in fluorescence of NBD - or pyrenyl - labeled F - actin ( Cooper et al . , 1986 ; Maciver et al . , 1991 ; Moon et al . , 1993 ; Quirk et al . , 1993 ; Maciver and Weeds , 1994 ) , but both properties were interpreted in terms of an increase in filament number due to fragmentation . The fragmentation hypothesis was enticing because it also provided a satisfac - tory explanation for the rapid drop in viscosity of F - actin solutions after addition of substoichiometric amounts of ADF , similar to the effect of the severing protein gelsolin . on A p r il 20 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published March 24 , 1997 Carlier et al . ADF / Cofilin Increases Actin Filament Turnover 1319 Further effort was made to visualize the fragmentation in electron or optical microscopy . In some instances , filaments were observed to be shorter , which was thought to be be - cause of depolymerization ( Abe and Obinata , 1989 ) or severing ( Cooper et al . , 1986 ) . In other instances , fila - ments did not appear shorter ( Ohta et al . , 1984 ) . In fluo - rescence optical microscopy , filaments immobilized on myosin - coated glass surfaces and partly stabilized by rhodamine - phalloidin appeared fragmented by flushing ADF in the flow - cell ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ) . The fragmentation hypothesis , however , did not provide a description of ADF effects fully consistent with all data . No increase in the number of ends could be detected using cytochalasin B . The severing was then thought to be tran - sient and followed by reannealing ( Hawkins et al . , 1993 ; Hayden et al . , 1993 ) . Other works rejected the reannealing hypothesis ( Nishida et al . , 1985 ; Maciver et al . , 1991 ) . The present work shows that some of the effects of ADF that were attributed to severing should be reinterpreted . First , the rapid decrease in fluorescence of pyrenyl - or NBD - labeled F - actin appears to be due to a quenching of fluorescence linked to ADF binding to F - actin . The depo - lymerization process is partial at all pHs and occurs on a slower time scale . The possibility of quenching has been evoked in other reports ( Ohta et al . , 1984 ; Cooper et al . , 1986 ; Moon et al . , 1993 ) but was not considered quantita - tively . Second , the apparent acceleration previously noted in the time courses of spontaneous polymerization in the presence of ADF / cofilins is explained , in view of the present work , by two independent reasons . First , in previ - ous works , polymerization was started by addition of KCl and MgCl 2 to mixtures of ADF and Ca – G - actin . ADF , which slows down metal / nucleotide exchange on G - actin , thereby slowed down the production of rapidly nucleating Mg - actin ( Tobacman and Korn , 1983 ) . Second , the tight binding of ADF / cofilin to F - ADP - actin , produced late in the polymerization process ( Carlier , 1991 ) , causes a de - layed increase in the specific light scattering of the fila - ment , which was not appreciated in earlier works . Third , the present kinetic data showing that the in - creases in rates are different at the two ends rule out the fragmentation hypothesis as an interpretation of the ef - fects of ADF on actin assembly / disassembly . Fourth , both electron microscope observations and sedimentation ve - locity data fail to show evidence for appreciable fragmen - tation of filaments by ADF1 . The absence of evident severing activity of ADF argues against the structural model recently proposed on the ba - sis of a severing activity of ADF ( Hatanaka et al . , 1996 ) , according to which ADF would bind actin like gelsolin segment - 1 , at the pointed end of the actin monomer . Proposals can be made to reconcile the above discrepan - cies about the severing activity of ADFs . The possibility cannot be discounted that some F - actin – binding proteins enhance photobleaching - induced fragmentation . It is also possible that ADF - decorated filaments are more fragile than native filaments and break more easily when submit - ted to the mechanical stresses involved in the preparation of samples for electron microscopy , to shearing forces in Ostwald - type viscometers ( Ohta et al . , 1984 ) , or to Brown - ian movement . Such side effects , however , are different from a gelsolin - like activity . More experiments are needed to explain these discrepancies . If the drop in viscosity cannot be interpreted by severing of filaments , an alternative explanation should be sought for the change in viscosity of the filaments linked to ADF binding to F - actin . It is possible that ADF binding induces a large change in the flexibility of the filaments . As noted by Ohta et al . ( 1984 ) , the binding of ADF to F - actin may change the surface properties of the filaments , affecting their electroviscosity , thus preventing the filament – filament interactions that lead to the formation of a gel . It is also possible that the ADF - induced increase in treadmilling rate changes the rheological properties of actin ( Isambert and Maggs , 1996 ) . Experiments are in progress to address these questions . Interestingly , the structural / mechanical change in actin filaments linked to the binding of an acces - sory protein may provide an alternative mechanistic de - scription of the gel – sol transition , thus far understood gen - erally in terms of filament severing ( Bray , 1992 ) . ADF Functions as an Actin Dynamizing Factor We show that ADF can increase up to 25 - fold the rate of treadmilling of actin filaments at steady state . This result implies that the rate - limiting step in the steady - state monomer – polymer exchange process is increased by ADF . The rate - limiting step is the dissociation of ADP - actin subunits from the pointed ends , which we show to be con - sistently 22 - fold higher when ADF is bound to F - actin . It is remarkable that the effect of ADF is end specific , the rate of dissociation of ADP - actin from the barbed ends being unaffected by ADF . The effect of ADF on the steady - state turnover of F - actin is displayed in Fig . 10 . In the absence of ADF , it is known that at steady state , barbed ends contain predominantly ADP - Pi subunits , while ADP subunits are present at the pointed ends . Net slow association of ATP – G - actin at the barbed ends is compensated by net slow depolymerization of ADP - actin at the pointed ends , which is the rate - limit - ing step in the cycle . To be specific , at the measured steady - state concentration of ATP - actin ( C SS ) , the on rate at the barbed end is (cid:63) ( C SS (cid:50) ) , where is the criti - cal concentration at the barbed end . The off rate at the pointed end is very close to , and these two fluxes are equal and of opposite sign . Using established values of 10 (cid:109) M (cid:50) 1 for , 0 . 1 (cid:109) M for C SS , and 0 . 2 s (cid:50) 1 for ( Pollard and Cooper , 1986 ) , we conclude that the value of must be 0 . 08 (cid:109) M to support a steady - state flux of 0 . 2 s (cid:50) 1 . In the presence of ADF , the steady - state cycle is faster as a result of the faster depolymerization of ADF - F - ADP - actin from the pointed ends . Subsequent dissociation of ADF from its complex with ADP – G - actin , followed by ex - change of ATP for bound ADP , results in a larger associa - tion flux of ATP – G - actin ( at a new steady - state concentra - tion C (cid:57) SS ) and ADF - ATP - G - actin to barbed ends . The new barbed end association flux is : ( 6 ) where { ADF } is the concentration of free ADF , is the critical concentration for polymerization of ADF - ATP - G - actin , and is the association rate constant of ADF - k B (cid:49) C BC C BC k P (cid:50) k B (cid:49) k P (cid:50) C BC J ON k + B C ( (cid:57) SS 0 . 08 ) k (cid:57) + B C ( (cid:57) SS ADF { } / K d C CADF ) – (cid:215) + – (cid:215) = C C ADF k B (cid:49) on A p r il 20 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published March 24 , 1997 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 136 , 1997 1320 ATP - G - actin to barbed ends . Assuming { ADF } (cid:53) 1 (cid:109) M as an example , since K d (cid:53) 10 (cid:109) M , the concentration of ADF - ATP - G - actin is 10 - fold lower than the concentration of ATP – G - actin . Since its critical concentration for polymer - ization ( ) is probably much larger than zero , the con - tribution of ADF - ATP - G - actin to barbed end growth at steady state ( second term in Eq . 6 ) is much lower than that of ATP – G - actin . Within this simplification , a 25 - fold faster steady - state flux of subunits through the filament ( i . e . , 5 s (cid:50) 1 ) will be established at a steady - state concentra - tion of ATP – G - actin C SS (cid:57) given by the following equation . , ( 7 ) which leads to C SS (cid:57) (cid:53) 0 . 58 (cid:109) M , to be compared to the value of 0 . 1 (cid:109) M found in the absence of ADF . This calcu - lation emphasizes that a 25 - fold faster treadmilling rate can be obtained at a steady - state concentration of ATP – G - actin less than sixfold higher than in the absence of ADF . In summary , an off rate of 5 s (cid:50) 1 at the pointed end is generated by the depolymerization of ADF - ADP - F - actin , and the concentration of ATP – G - actin self - adjusts to a higher value that allows the on - flux at the barbed end to exactly compensate the off - flux from the pointed ends . In the presence of ADF , the steady - state concentration of monomeric actin is a mixture of ATP – G - actin , ADP – G - actin , and their complexes with ADF . While the total con - centration of all these components ( 1 . 7 (cid:109) M ) is obtained in sedimentation assays , the exact partial concentration of each of these species is the steady - state solution of a set of differential equations describing the kinetics of association C C ADF k (cid:49) B C SS (cid:57) ( 0 . 08 ) 5 s 1 – = – (cid:215) and dissociation of each species to the two ends of the fila - ment ( in preparation ) . According to the above calculation , in the presence of 1 (cid:109) M free ADF , if ATP – G - actin is equal to 0 . 58 (cid:109) M at steady state , and if the amounts of ADF - ATP - G - actin and ADP – G - actin represent only 10 % of the amounts of ATP – G - actin and ADF - ADP - G - actin , respectively ( see the values of the equilibrium dissociation constants , Table II ) , the measured amount of 1 . 7 (cid:109) M unas - sembled actin would imply that the concentration of ADF - ADP - G - actin is close to 1 . 12 (cid:109) M . These values should be considered as plausible approximates that reasonably ac - count for the data . We should note that because ADF has a much higher af - finity for ADP - actin than for ATP - actin , the nature of the major actin species that associates to the filament ( mostly ATP - actin ) is not the same as the one that dissociates from the filament ( mostly ADF - ADP - actin ) , both in terms of bound nucleotide and in terms of bound ligand that poten - tially allows ADF to modulate the nonlinearity in the J ( c ) plots ( Carlier , 1991 ) . ADF Activates Actin - based Motility Do the above in vitro biochemical properties of ADF pro - vide a clue to understanding its cellular function in actin - based motility ? It has long been recognized ( Wang , 1985 ; Fechheimer and Zigmond , 1993 ) that net polymerization of actin occurs at the front of locomoting cells , while net depolymerization occurs throughout the lamella , but puz - zlingly the rate of actin flux in this treadmilling - like pro - cess was one order of magnitude faster than expected from Figure 10 . ADF increases the treadmilling of actin fila - ments . T , D - Pi , and D repre - sent the ATP , ADP - Pi , and ADP , respectively , bound to actin . The different sizes of the different species drawn are meant to give an idea of their relative steady - state concentrations . on A p r il 20 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published March 24 , 1997 Carlier et al . ADF / Cofilin Increases Actin Filament Turnover 1321 the in vitro measurements of actin filament treadmilling . Similarly , the rate of Listeria movement in Xenopus egg extracts appeared 10 - fold faster than the calculated rate of actin assembly ( Marchand et al . , 1995 ) in the medium . The present data showing that ADF increases the rate of tread - milling in vitro up to values of the same magnitude as the one observed in vivo in the lamellipodium ( Small , 1995 ; Small et al . , 1995 ) lead us to conclude that endogenous ADF is responsible for this fast rate . The actin - based pro - pulsion of Listeria monocytogenes in acellular extracts offers an opportunity to test the effects of ADF in an integrated system closer to the in vivo situation . ADF increases the rate of propulsion because it increases the rate of depoly - merization from the pointed ends of the bulk population of filaments , which kinetically limits the rate of barbed end assembly at the bacterium surface . This in turn causes the shortening of the capped filaments present in the medium , in particular those in the body of the actin tail attached to the bacteria , hence a shortening of the tail itself . Assuming that the motility assay of Listeria in acellular extracts is a good model for actin - based motile processes in response to signaling , these results indicate that ADF might , by the same mechanism , control the dynamics and the length of actin filaments in vivo . They also account for the enhanced motility of cells overexpressing cofilin ( Aizawa et al . , 1996 ) , and for the high levels of ADF in developmental stages ( Bamburg and Bray , 1987 ; Abe et al . , 1989 , 1996 ) , in which extensive actin dynamics are involved . In conclusion , it is emphasized that different actin - bind - ing proteins amazingly use the conformational switch of ATP hydrolysis on actin in a variety of ways to modulate actin dynamics . Profilin , in binding preferentially to ATP - actin , promotes assembly at the barbed ends ( Pantaloni and Carlier , 1993 ; Perelroizen et al . , 1996 ) . ADF , in bind - ing preferentially to ADP - actin , enhances the directional shuttling of subunits through the filaments . We thank Drs . Yukio Doi , David Drubin , Thomas D .
