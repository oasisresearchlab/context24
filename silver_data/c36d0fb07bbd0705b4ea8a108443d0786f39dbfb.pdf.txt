We established apparently normal foraging behavior in captive bumblebees utilizing artificial flowers . Syrup rewards of flowers visited were experimentally manipulated to correspond to nectar volumes found in flowers utilized in the field . 2 . Bees became > 90 % flower - constant to either of two flower types ( distinguished by color ) when rewarded with 1 . 0 gl 50 % sucrose at each visit to flowers of one color , while the others remained unrewarded . 3 . Flower - constancy to ' blue ' was achieved within 50 flower visits , but equal flower constancy to ' white ' was achieved only after 250 flower visits . 4 . While being trained to white flowers the bees increased their percent correct ( rewarding ) flower choice over consecutive foraging trips during the day , but decreased their performance overnight . 5 . Bees trained to blue did not switch to white flowers even when the white were subsequently rewarded with more food than the blue . However , bees trained to white utilized blue flowers . 6 . Most bees simultaneously presented with white flowers having six times greater syrup rewards than blue visited both in approximately equal proportions independent of flower density , while some individuals visited primarily blue flowers . 7 . The laboratory experiments suggest that bumblebees , once conditioned , are relatively ' constant ' foragers despite changes in resource availability . Introduction On the average the pollen collected by bumblebees on any one foraging trip is derived from several species of plants ( see Grant , 1950 ; Brian , 1952 ; Free , 1970 ) , and bumblebees have long been considered as ' inconstant ' foragers in comparison with honeybees . At any given time and place some of the bumblebees of one species may be foraging primarily from flower species A and secondarily 248 B . Heinrich et al . visiting B and C , for example , while other individuals are foraging primarily from species C and secondarily visiting species A and D ( Heinrich , 1976 ) . Are these apparent individual differences due to flower ' inconstancy , ' to individ - ual biases , or are they due of different individual foraging histories ? Primary determinants of flower - choice in bumblebees appear to be the amount , quality , and availability of nectar and pollen ( Hobbs , 1962 ; Heinrich , 1976 ; Inouye , 1976 ) . Numerous studies indicate that unconditioned bees visit flowers without apparent regard to their color ( Kugler , 1943 ; Manning , 1956 ; Brian , 1957 ) . However , if the bees are conditioned rapidly to the colors of rewarding food sources then it is possible that field observations would unmask neither possible inherent species - specific nor individual color biases . Further - more , if conditioned bees respond only slowly , or not at all , to changing resource availability then different bees in any one set of conditions could exhibit a large range of foraging behaviors . To distinguish between the various possibilities it is necessary to control the bees ' foraging history and to study learning and switching rates . The technical difficulties of keeping track of , and altering , the foraging history of bees unrestrained in the field are formidable . We report here on the foraging behavior of bumblebees in an ' arena ' in the laboratory using artificial flowers . We manipulated the amount of food reward of each ' flower ' visited to correspond to nectar amounts found in flowers visited by bumblebees in the field ( Heinrich , 1975 ) . The time that the bees were allowed to forage was controlled . Materials and Methods All foraging behavior was examined in a 2 . 3 m 2 plexiglass enclosure 12 cm in height . The top of this foraging ' arena ' was transparent , the sides were opaque , and the floor was overlaid with a dark green sheet of plexiglass onto which the artificial ' flowers ' were placed . The blue and white ' petals ' were cut from commercially available Scotch brand tapes using a punch device designed to produce cardboard slips ( 12 mm long and tapering from 1 . 5 mm to 2 . 5 mm ) for mounting small insects . The petals were stuck ( wide portion of petal inward ) onto thin ( 1 mm ) transparent plexiglass squares around a 2 . 5 mm diameter hole drilled through the center . The flowers were onto the floor of the enclosure directly over holes drilled through the green plexiglass placed . Counter - sunk holes in the plexiglass beneath the green foraging surface served as syrup wells fed by PE 50 ( I . D . = . 023 " ) Intramedic polyethylene tubing . The tubing of each experimentally rewarded flower was connected to a 50 gl syringe in association with a PB 600 Hamilton push button repeating dispenser . One button - push of a dispenser delivered 1 . 0 gt of syrup into the well beneath a flower . As indicated , the syrup consisted either of a 50 % sucrose solution , or honey diluted to 50 % with water . During the initial conditioning of individual bees ( and , as indicated , during some subsequent experiments ) only four flowers were used . The flowers were either ' blue ' or ' white , ' and proved to be distinguishable to the bees . They were set 15 cm apart in a square , with the two flowers of each color placed diagonally . Two of the flowers ( one color ) were refilled each time one of them was visited ( emptied ) by the bee . The other two ( another color ) were not rewarded even when visited by the foraging bee . The bees flew back and forth between the flowers , taking the 1 . 0 lxl syrup ( or honey ) from each refilled flower encountered . The minimum number of flowers visited to constitute a ' foraging trip ' was 20 . The duration of foraging trips ranged from about 3 to 60 min ( see Results ) . The bees distinguished our artificial flowers on the basis of color signals other than ultraviolet . Flower Constancy in Laboratory - foraging Bumblebees 249 Neither color used was reflective in the ultraviolet ( determined by illuminating with ultraviolet , and viewing through a television camera equipped with a filter to eliminate all but ultraviolet light ; see Eisner et al . , 1969 ) . The exact reflectance characteristics of our artificial flowers relative to background ( see Appendix ) undoubtedly is of great importance in evaluating possible signal - dependent learning curves . However , for our reward - related switching behaviors and experiments on flower constancy , we were primarily concerned that the bees could distinguish between the two alternative flowers and that they could be conditioned to them . We largely eliminated scent as a cue in orientation to rewarding flowers by using sucrose . However , naive bees were difficult to train to the artificial flowers unless we provided scent ( using honey rather than sucrose ) for the first foraging trip . When rewarding with honey we also scented the alternate ( empty ) flowers with honey - soaked filter paper ( placed around the syrup - well under - neath the flower ) so that scent could not act as a cue in identifying rewarding flowers . After the bees had begun using the artificial flowers , sucrose was substituted for honey and the alternative flowers were left unscented . The positions of the rewarded flowers were changed from one foraging bout to the next . The experimental bees were all workers . They were captured in the field and individually caged in wooden boxes ( 1 . 0 m 3 or larger ) covered with glass . Bees removed from their cage ( by grasping a leg with forceps ) and placed into the foraging arena usually began foraging within several seconds if they had been deprived of syrup for a half day . Only one bee at a time was allowed on the foraging arena . The foraging table and flowers were washed after each foraging trip . Results 1 . Foraging Behavior on Arena Flower - visitation rates varied with the number of rewarding and nonrewarding flowers encountered . The bees probed into empty as well as into rewarding flowers . However , they remained to take up ' all ' of the syrup from rewarding flowers , while quickly withdrawing their proboscis from empty flowers and flying to the next flower . Bees initiating foraging sometimes spent several minutes at each rewarding flower encountered , which they probed and reprobed nu - merous times . Experienced bees probed rewarding flowers for several seconds , and with a flight of a second or less they reached the next highly rewarding flower . They remained at unrewarded flowers for less than a second , and when many unrewarded flowers were encountered they achieved maximum sustained rates of flower visitation of 8 flowers / min . Some bees visited over 200 flowers consecutively per foraging trip in those experiments where the flowers were infrequently refilled . Such foraging trips sometimes required nearly an hour . The rate of flower visitation , the duration of foraging trips , as well as the amount of syrup reward provided per flower , were similar to those observed at some flowers under natural conditions in the field ( Heinrich , 1975 ) . The foraging behavior we observed thus closely approximates that occurring under natural conditions . The bees were generally not site - specific to specific individual flowers . Having been conditioned to visit ' blue , ' for example , they visited these flowers , whether filled or empty , no matter where they were placed in the arena . While switching from blue to white flowers they sometimes visited the first rewarding flower they found several times in succession before approaching also the other ( empty ) white flowers ( see Fig . 9 ) : 250 B . Heinrich et al . 2 . Survival Length of life necessarily restricts time available for learning . Evolution may therefore impose life span - related restrictions on the length of time during which the bees could be conditioned to the numerous possible unrewarding and rewarding flowers . We observed a high mortality in our captive bees , similar to that observed previously in the field ( Heinrich , 1976 ) . On the average 8 . 4 % of the bees died per day ( Fig . 1 ) . Some of the mortality may have been due to insufficient food . However , the bees were allowed to forage ad libidum once , twice , or three times ( as indicated ) per day . A large proportion of the bees died from parasitism of the fly larva of Physocephala sp . ( Conopidae ) , also reported to infect 12 . 7 % of bumblebee workers during July and August in Ontario ( MacFarlane and Pengelly , 1974 ) . During July a group of 41 Bombus ternarius Say ( captured from Apocynum androsaemifolium L . ) had only one survivor after 15 days . Twenty - one of these bees each contained the fly larva in the abdomen when they died . The flies also heavily parasitized the B . terricola Kirby . Only seven B . terricola remained after 15 days from a group of 36 captured on Spirea latifolia ( Ait . ) Borkh . in mid - July . Eleven of the dead bees were parasitized by the fly . Twenty B . terri - cola captured in August from Solidago sp . had only 5 survivors after 5 days . Nine of the dead bees were parasitized . It is probable that the bees were para - sitized only in the field , since we maintained the bees in closed containers in the laboratory . The mortality due of fly parasitism could therefore be greater \ if ) W x 2 8 - , ~ \ x ~ 20 - \ " \ l ~ 03 16 - I LL o 12 - d Z 8 - 4 - ~ ~ ~ (cid:141)215 X ~ x 0 i I I I I I I J I I I l E 0 2 4 6 8 I0 12 14 DAYS Fig . l .

Scent and Color Signals Initial foraging orientation appeared to be guided primarily by scent . During the first foraging trips in the laboratory arena , two groups of 12 B . ternarius ( both captured from the pinkish Apocynum androsaemifoIium ) each visited almost exclusively the flowers rewarded with honey , regardless of whether their color was white or blue ( Table 1 ) . When both the rewarded as well as the nonrewarded flowers were scented with honey ( see Methods ) scent was no longer a distinguishing cue , and the bees ' choice appeared to be influenced by color . For example , when the white flowers were rewarded , a group of seven bees ( captured from yellow Solidago ) visited both white and blue flowers in approximately equal proportions , as though they were not reacting to flower color . But when only the blue flowers were rewarded , the percent blue flowers visited was significantly higher than random ( Table 1 ) . There were no blue flowers in the immediate area where the bees were captured . The foregoing data suggest that the bees initially orient to the scent of the food reward rather than to flower color . However , in the absence of scent as a distinguishing characteristic between rewarding and nonre - warding flowers , they used color cues . In all subsequently reported experiments scent of the food reward was largely eliminated as an effective signaling cue . Both rewarded and unrewarded flowers were scented for the first foraging trip in order to initiate the foraging response at the artificial flowers . But for subsequent foraging trips the bees were rewarded with sucrose , and the unrewarded flowers were left unscented . 4 . Color Conditioning Before the experiments on flower constancy and switching could be performed , we trained the bees to visit either of the two types of flowers ( blue and white ) . Table l .

N , numbers of foraging trips Flower Constancy in Laboratory - foraging Bumblebees 253 Color training showed that bees could indeed unfailingly differentiate the two types of flowers . Furthermore , they learned to restrict themselves to the blue flowers more rapidly than to the white . Bombus terricola workers captured from pinkish Asclepias learned to restrict themselves almost entirely either to blue or to white flowers , by - passing the flowers of the color that was not rewarded . The bees were flower - constant to blue during the first foraging trip , or they became flower - constant before visiting 50 flowers ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) . On the other hand , when the white flowers were rewarded , the bees did not by - pass most of the blue flowers until after about the 8th foraging trip , or about 250 flowers . In general , the more flowers the bees had visited in these experiments , the more time had elapsed . The present experiments do not differentiate between time - and event - dependent learning . We held feeding schedules relatively con - stant . However , our results do show some effects of time as such , on learning performances . For example , when the percentage of ' correct ' flower ( color ) choices are plotted for up to six days of training , there are relatively large ranges and large standard errors in percent flower choice for training to white ( Fig . 4 ) . On the other hand , both the ranges and the standard errors are small when the data are plotted as a function of numbers of flowers visited , even near the beginning of the foraging career , at about 250 flowers visited ( Fig . 3 ) . Apparently the bees must visit a sufficient number of flowers per day ( or gather a sufficient ammount of food from them ) before they become flower , o 0 0 I00 a ) " ~ 90 (cid:1)84 0 80 ~ , ~ o TO - . _ ~ 60 - > ' ~ 50 - 40 - 30 - 20 6 4 8 3 7 6 7 7 6 7 5 6 5 5 5 5 I0 i 5 8 9 7 7 4 4 4 4 WHITE , , i i , i i I 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Doys of training Fig . 4 .

Change in percent of visits to correct ( rewarded ) flowers during successive foraging trips when the rewarded flower was blue ( top ) or white ( bottom ) . Cross - hatched bars indicate the change in performance in consecutive trips from the morning to the afternoon . Stippled bars indicate the change in performance in consecutive trips from the afternoon to the next morning . Numerals indicate the number of foraging trips ( different bees ) on which the average is based constant . All of the bees that had low percentages ( 55 - 80 % ) of correct choices at the end of five days had visited fewer than 120 rewarding flowers . On the other hand , those bees that had visited at least 190 rewarding flowers at the end of 6 days restricted at least 94 % of their visits to the rewarding white flowers . After visiting over 350 rewarding flowers they were 98 to 100 % flower - constant to white . The learning performance was tess well correlated with the number of flowers visited when flower visits were spread out over a long period of time than when consecutive trips were close together . For example , while being trained to white flowers the bees ' ' correct ' flower choice increased over consecutive foraging trips separated by 5 h or less ( daytime ) , while some of this performance was lost during the 19 h overnight ( Fig . 5 , botton ) . As long as the improvement during the day exceeded the decrement overnight , overall performance continued to increase . Performance stabilized when the increase during the day equaled the decrement overnight . While being trained to blue flowers , performance often stabilized at near 95 % correct flower choice within one foraging trip ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) . Consequently , in this case the small variability in performance from one trip to the next did not reveal possible differential effects related to time ( see Fig . 5 , top ) . Bees that had been trained by being simultaneous rewarded at both white and blue flowers but with the white containing six times greater food reward than the blue , also showed the effect of the temporal spacing of reward on Flower Constancy in Laboratory - foraging Bumblebees 255 Table 2 .

Those bees that had visited more white than blue flowers showed significantly ( P < 0 . 05 ) greater increments in percent visits to the more rewarding flowers in consecutive foraging trips over the day than the consecutive trips with intervening night ( Table 2 ) . 5 . Training Using Variable Food Rewards We investigated the effect of different reward amounts and reward schedules on the apparently inherent biases toward blue over white . White flowers were provided with six times greater rewards than the blue by either placing more syrup into them ( Fig . 6 ) or by rewarding the blue less often than the white ( Fig . 7 ) . In both experiments most of the bees ( captured from white Spiraea latifoIia ) visited varying percentages of both white and blue flowers . The bees initially visited 40 % blue flowers , but they improved their performance signifi - cantly ( P < 0 . 05 ) . However , no bees switched entirely to white flowers . Foraging trips during which 90 % or more white flowers were visited were few , even though several of the bees visited over 500 flowers during the 10 days ( up to 20 foraging trips per bee ) of this experiment . Two bees became 100 % flower - constant to blue flowers ( Fig . 6 , bottom ) . Such strict fidelity to the six times less rewarding flower was not the result of total abstinence from the white . For example , bee ( ) visited 3 white and 29 blue flowers on its first foraging trip , but for the next 740 flower visits it remained exclusively on blue . In contrast , bee ( zx ) visited 2 white and 21 blue flowers on its first foraging trip . On its next foraging trip it visited 57 % white , remaining at approximately the same percentage white for the next 700 flowers . Although both bees were captured from white Spiraea , and although both had initially similar experiences on the foraging arena , the two bees diverged widely in their subsequent behavior . A large percentage of flower visits by some bees were to both white and blue in roughly equal proportions . Were these bees not discriminating between the white and the blue flowers because they were not distinguishing between them ? We had learned that the bees could distinguish the white from the blue flowers ( Figs . 2 - 5 ) . Since the bees improved their performance in choosing the more rewarding ( white ) flowers from the less ( blue ) , from one foraging trip to the next on a given day , it appears unlikely that they were foraging randomly between the white and the blue flowers . They are apparently able 256 B . Heiurich et al .

OF FLOWERS VISITED Fig . 8 . Percent visits to training color as a function of total number of flowers visited . The blue and white flowers presented during the test were equaIly rewarded . The day prior to the test the bees were fed 32 gl syrup at either blue ( filled symbols ) or white flowers ( empty symbols ) . The 32 gl was provided in 8 gl per flower from 4 flowers ( top left ) , 2 gl per flower from 16 flowers ( lower left ) , 1 gl per flower from 32 flowers ( top right ) , 1 / 2 pl per flower from 64 flowers ( lower right ) . Different symbols represent different bees only within each of the four subplots . Foraging performance of individual trips is plotted as a function of the total number of flowers visited to perceive a difference in the amount of food between the two populations of flowers . Were the bees ' counting ' the number of rewarding flowers visited , or did they measure the amount of food gathered ? We tested the bees ' flower choice after giving them 32 ~ tl 50 % sucrose distributed in 4 , 16 , 32 , or 64 flowers . Under all four conditions , bees ( captured from yellow Solidago ) that had been rewarded at blue visited 90 - 100 % blue in the presence of white flowers ( both the blue and the white flowers were equally rewarding in the test ) . However , most bees that had been fed 32 gl syrup at white flowers initially also visited primarily blue flowers ( Fig . 8 ) . On successive foraging trips over the next four days , when the arena contained two white flowers and two blue flowers with one of each being rewarded with 1 lal syrup , most of the bees that had fed on 32 gl syrup from blue flowers began to visit also white flowers . Similarly , the bees that had fed on 32 gl syrup from white flowers continued to visit blue flowers . These results therefore did not indicate any obvious biases created 258 K Heinrich et al . by using a 16 - fold difference in numbers of flowers visited , given a constant reward of 32 gl 50 % sucrose solution . 6 . Flower Constancy and Switching Bees with known foraging histories were subjected to changing resource availabil - ity in order to determine the effect of previous experience on flower constancy and switching . We used bees rewarded at either only blue or only white flowers for 10 days . In the following experiments the foraging arena initially contained two flowers of each color , as before . However , one flower of each color was rewarded , rather than both of one kind . Four flowers of the previously nonrewarded color were added to the foraging arena for each successive foraging trip until it held 34 flowers of the previously rewarded color , and only two of the other color . None of the added flowers was rewarded . This procedure could be used to determine at what ' dilution ' of the training color the bees switched to the more rewarding opposite color ( see Figs . 9 and 10 ) . While visiting the two differently colored flowers on a given foraging trip , the bees alternated their visits between them ( Fig . 9 ) , much like bees in the field ( see Fig . 5 ; Heinrich , 1976 ) . Visiting a rewarding flower of one color did not result in immediate switching to that color , even though numerous empty flowers of the opposite color had just been encountered . However , as more and more empty flowers were provided , some bees changed from ' major - ing ' on one color while ' minoring ' on the other , to equal preferences for both , before ultimately adopting the previous minor as the new major . Most bees previously rewarded only at blue flowers visited equally rewarded white flowers only at very low frequency ( Fig . 10 ) . Furthermore , when empty blue flowers were added to the foraging table , the bees visited them , flying rapidly from one to another ( up to 8 / rain ) . As more blue flowers were added the probability of probing into the one available rewarding flower became less and less . We observed bees visiting up to 75 empty flowers in succession without encountering the one rewarding flower among the total of 34 present . Since one of the two white flowers was rewarding , switching to white would have resulted in a 50 % probability of being rewarded at each flower . Several of the bees occasionally visited the white flowers and were rewarded at them ; however , they did not switch to white even when rarely encountering a rewarding blue flower ( Fig . 10 , top ) . During this ' dilution ' of reward at blue , the position of the rewarding flowers was changed with each run in order to reduce or eliminate site - specificity . If left undisturbed the bees engaged in long foraging trips ( sometimes over 200 flowers per trip ) . However , during the dilution runs they were usually allowed to forage only until they had visited 30 flowers on the 4 or 5 times per day that they were given access to the foraging arena . It was possible that the bees were not consolidating the information ( negative rewards at blue ; or positive on white ) received on one day until the next . We therefore continued testing them once per day for three days following the dilution experiment . The bees continued to visit a few white flowers as Flower Constancy in Laboratory - foraging Bumblebees 259 Fig . 9 .

It was also possible that they had not visited sufficient numbers of the rewarding white to cause them to switch from the largely empty blue flowers . However , feeding the bees for 20 flower visits ( 20 gl 50 % sucrose ) at white flowers on the evening of the second day had no major effect on their responses the next day .

Indicated at the top are the percent flower choice of six bees trained to blue ( 84 - 1158 total flower visits ) . The results of seven bees trained to white ( 215 - 1036 total flower visits ) are given in bottom graph . The same bees were tested on the last foraging set - up ( 36 flowers total ) for three consecutive days ( see right ) after the experiment requiring two days ( at left ) . Designations as in Figure 3 on white rewarding flowers visited blue flowers when the rewarding white flowers were diluted out ( Fig . 10 , bottom ) . Indeed , several bees visited a greater percent - age of blue than white on the first foraging trip where they were presented with two white and two blue flowers with one of each being rewarded . On subsequent trips ( later in the day ) they again visited primarily white flowers . As the rewarding white flowers continued to be diluted out with nonrewarding flowers , some bees visited increasing percentages of blue flowers ( Fig . 11 ) . On the average , however , bees continued to visit the white without switching ( Fig . 10 ) . As indicated previously ( Fig . 5 ) , there was a tendency for the bees to learn over successive foraging trips during the day , but to decrease in perfor - mance overnight . During the 34 days after the initiation of the dilution of white flowers ( while the foraging arena contained 33 empty white flowers and one filled one ) , the bees continued to visit the white flowers at a high frequency ( Fig . 10 , bottom ) ; The bees were fed 20 pl 50 % sucrose at 20 blue flowers on the evening of the second day of the dilution run .

Switching behavior of a selected individual from composite data in Figure 10 ( lower graph ) . See text for description of the experiment . The consecutive foraging trips ( indicated by dots ) were observed over two consecutive days ( 1 , 2 ) visited 34 % white , or less ( Fig . 10 , bottom , far right ) . A 20gl reward was apparently not sufficient to cause the bees to abandon the white flowers to which they had originally been trained , but which were subsequently made less remunerative . It is of interest that most of the bees tended to visit approxi - mately similar percentages of white and blue flowers independently of flower density , rather than remaining with one , switching to the other , or foraging randomly . The same experiments were performed with B . ternarius and the results were similar to those on B . terricola . Four bees rewarded for 10 days ( 284460 total flower visits ) at only blue flowers still visited 80 - 100 % blue flowers per foraging trip when the blue flowers had been diluted ( in the course of 9 foraging trips over 2 days ) to 33 empty blue flowers and one refilled one . In the reverse experiment ( the dilution of the white flowers ) the two experimental bees switched nearly entirely to blue after two days when the white flowers had been diluted down to one rewarding flower per 34 . One of these bees was tested four times on the day following the dilution experiment on the arena with 2 blue and 34 white flowers . During these four trips the bee visited 176 blue and 2 white flowers . The switch from white to blue flowers was essentially complete . Discussion The foraging behavior of nectivores offers an attractive system for the study of behavioral mechanisms of resource exploitation . The foraging behavior of bumblebees ( Kugler , 1943 ; Manning , 1956 ; Brian , 1957 ; Heinrich , 1972 , 1976 ) 262 B . Heinrich et al . in particular is a convenient model system because these animals get virtually all of their energy supplies from sugar in nectar . However , it has so far not been possib ! e either to evaluate or manipulate the minute and ecologically relevant food rewards of individual flowers visited . In the present study we succeeded in training bumblebees to forage from artificial flowers in the laboratory . We experimentally controlled the amount of food reward in each flower visited . We then examined learning , flower con - stancy , and switching , as affected by different food rewards in two types of flowers that the bees could distinguish on the basis of color . Signal - dependent Learning and Forgetting . The most detailed analyses on learning and memory to date have been those on the honeybee ( Menzel , 1968 ; Kriston , 1971 , 1973 ; Koltermann , 1973 ) . Earlier literature is reviewed by von Frisch ( 1967 ) . No comparative data has previously been available . Our data from bumblebees show similarities to those of honeybees . Honeybees learn to associate sugar syrup with violet ( 428 nm ) at 85 % probability , for example , after 1 reward ( their fill of 2 m sucrose ) , while similar probability of choosing green ( 532 nm ) requires 4 rewards ( see Menzel , 1968 ; Menzel et al . , 1974 ) . The bees of the present study , whether captured from white , pink or yellow flowers , initially had greater tendencies to visit blue as opposed to white flowers on a green background in the foraging arena . As in honeybees , the apparently less ' attrac - tive ' color cue was chosen if associated with appropriate rewards . The number of ' rewards ' used to alter color choice , however , is not equivalent between the honeybee experiments and ours . We used primarily 1 . 0 ~ tl rewards of 50 % sucrose . Our bees visited about 200 white rewarding flowers before they became flower - constant to white flowers . They became flower - constant to blue flowers ( in the presence of white flowers ) within one foraging trip ( while visiting < 50 blue flowers ) . The 50 ~ tl syrup gathered from 50 flowers constitutes approxi - mately one honey - stomach load . Learning the white signal proceeded in stepwise increments . Generally the bees improved their percent choice of rewarding white flowers on the second foraging trip of the day , while decreasing their performance overnight ( Fig . 5 , Table 2 ) . Honeybees incorporate information into a ' short - term memory ' soon after being rewarded . After 15 min the information is ' consolidated ' into ' long - term memory ' ( Menzel , 1968 ; Erber , 1975 ) where it remains until death or until re - learning occurs . It appears that the bumblebees are programmed to be inconstant , at least with respect to white . The inconstancy may be based , in part , on memory decay that would then be signal dependent . What is the biological significance of the apparent bias in learning and forgetting of color cues ? One possibility is that it is related to the food rewards normally found in nature . Mfiller ( 1881 ) noted a preponderance of blue and purple colors in flowers utilized by bees , while ' fly flowers ' tended to be white . Similar observations have been made in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado ( David Inouye , personal communication ) . In general , flowers adapted for bum - blebee pollinators should yield larger net food rewards to bumblebees than flowers adapted for fly pollinators ( Heinrich and Raven , 1972 ) . Initial prefer - ences for blue rather than for white flowers may thus aid the bees in approaching , Flower Constancy in Laboratory - foraging Bumblebees 263 and utilizing , flowers that have ' proven ' themselves through evolution to be dependable sources of food . ' Caution ' in adopting signals that are frequently associated with low food rewards may be advantageous . The preceding hypothesis is not in full agreement with some previous studies . Kugler ( 1943 ) concluded that flower choice is entirely a function of conditioning . He reviews the concept of Hummelblumen , considering ' bumblebee flowers ' not to be characterized by any one distinguishing characteristic . Nonetheless , he considered flowers specialized for bumblebee pollinators to be essentially large bee flowers , which typically have relatively large amounts of hidden nectar . Majoring and Minoring . Bumblebees do not communicate the location of re - munerative food sources to nestmates . Each forager must assess the availability of food from different flowers in the field individually . Individuals in the field have a major and one or several minor specialties ( Heinrich , 1976 ) . Strict major - ing at any one time is the optimum response ( Oster and Heinrich , 1976 ) provided the bees are utilizing the best available food resource . But the bees must assess many flowers other than the most remunerative , and the food resources change with time . Minoring on less rewarding flowers than the best allows them to keep track of changing resources . The results of the present study suggest that the individual differences in foraging specializations observed at any one time and place in the field ( see Fig . 5 ; Heinrich , 1976 ) could in part be due to different foraging histories . However , the results do not rule out possibly inherent individual differences . Different bees having identical inherent preferences would predictably show a large variety of age - or experience - related major and minor specializations under given assortments of different flowers . The largest variety of forager specializations observed at any instant should occur when the most rewarding flowers have the least attractive signals . Under these conditions many of the bees would not have stabilized their flower choice . On the other hand , if the most attractive signal is associated with the best food rewards then there would be low variety of foraging specialists as bees quickly assess the state of nature . Competition would tend to equalize the net food rewards available from differ - ent flowers and cause bees to visit flowers regardless of their signaling cues . Switching . The ability to utilize an alternative food source was inversely related to the ability to learn . Blue , in contrast to white , was learned rapidly and with few rewards , and the bees were unwilling to switch to white under our experimental conditions . On the other hand , bees trained to blue utilized and , in some cases , switched to white flowers . Switching , or the utilization of another signal as a cue , thus appeared to follow a forgetting of the previous cue . Blue was not easily forgotten in the sense that memory appears to be partially innate or rapidly imprinted . White , on the other hand , was not readily stored in the ' long - term ' memory , either re - establishing other biases , or opening the way for the adaptation of new cues . Foraging demands different skills at different flowers , and the learning of those skills may be costly in terms of time and energy ( Heinrich , 1976 ) . Conserva - tion in switching behavior is therefore advantageous , particularly when lifetimes 264 B . Heinrich et al . are short and the alternative flower has a low probability of yielding consistently high rewards . Acknowledgements . We thank Lloyd E .
