Cancer Statistics , 2016 Rebecca L . Siegel , MPH 1 ; Kimberly D . Miller , MPH 2 ; Ahmedin Jemal , DVM , PhD 3 Each year , the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths that will occur in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence , mortality , and survival . Incidence data were collected by the National Cancer Institute ( Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results [ SEER ] Program ) , the Centers for Dis - ease Control and Prevention ( National Program of Cancer Registries ) , and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries . Mortality data were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics . In 2016 , 1 , 685 , 210 new cancer cases and 595 , 690 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States . Overall cancer incidence trends ( 13 oldest SEER registries ) are stable in women , but declining by 3 . 1 % per year in men ( from 2009 - 2012 ) , much of which is because of recent rapid declines in prostate cancer diagnoses . The cancer death rate has dropped by 23 % since 1991 , translating to more than 1 . 7 million deaths averted through 2012 . Despite this progress , death rates are increasing for cancers of the liver , pancreas , and uterine corpus , and cancer is now the leading cause of death in 21 states , primarily due to exceptionally large reductions in death from heart disease . Among children and adolescents ( aged birth - 19 years ) , brain cancer has surpassed leukemia as the leading cause of cancer death because of the dramatic therapeutic advances against leukemia . Accelerating progress against cancer requires both increased national investment in cancer research and the application of existing cancer control knowledge across all seg - ments of the population .

Keywords : cancer cases , cancer statistics , death rates , incidence , mortality , survival , trends Introduction Cancer is a major public health problem worldwide and is the second leading cause of death in the United States . In this article , we provide the expected numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in 2016 in the United States nationally and for each state , as well as a comprehensive overview of cancer incidence , mortality , and survival rates and trends using the most current population - based data . In addition , we estimate the total number of deaths averted during the past 2 decades as a result of the continual decline in cancer death rates . We also present the actual number of deaths reported in 2012 by age for the 10 leading causes of death and for the 5 leading causes of cancer death . Materials and Methods Incidence and Mortality Data Mortality data from 1930 to 2012 were provided by the National Center for Health Statistics ( NCHS ) . 1 , 2 Forty - seven states and the District of Columbia met data quality requirements for reporting to the national vital statistics system in 1930 . Texas , Alaska , and Hawaii began reporting mortality data in 1933 , 1959 , and 1960 , respectively . The methods for abstraction and age adjustment of mortality data are described elsewhere . 2 , 3 Population - based cancer incidence data in the United States have been collected by the National Cancer Institute’s ( NCI’s ) Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results ( SEER ) Program since 1973 and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Program of Cancer Registries ( NPCR ) since 1995 . The SEER program is the only source for long - term population - based incidence data . Long - term incidence and survival trends ( 1975 - 2012 ) were based on data from the 9 oldest SEER areas ( Connecticut , Hawaii , Iowa , New Mexico , Utah , and the metropolitan areas of Atlanta , Detroit , San Francisco - Oakland , and Seattle - Puget Sound ) , representing approximately 9 % of the US population . 4 As of 1992 , SEER data have been available for 4 additional SEER registries ( Alaska Natives , Los Angeles county , San Jose - Monterey , and rural Georgia ) that increase coverage of minority groups , allowing for stratiﬁcation by race and ethnicity . 1 Director , Surveillance Information , Surveillance and Health Services Research , American Cancer Society , Atlanta , GA ; 2 Epidemiologist , Surveillance and Health Services Research , American Cancer Society , Atlanta , GA ; 3 Vice President , Surveillance and Health Services Research , American Cancer Society , Atlanta , GA Corresponding author : Rebecca L .

Data from all 18 SEER areas were the source for cancer stage distribution , stage - speciﬁc survival , and the lifetime probability of devel - oping cancer . 6 The probability of developing cancer was calculated using NCI’s DevCan software ( version 6 . 7 . 3 ) . 7 Much of the statistical information presented herein was adapted from data previously published in the SEER Cancer Statistics Review 1975 - 2012 . 8 The North American Association of Central Cancer Registries ( NAACCR ) compiles and reports incidence data from 1995 onward for cancer registries that participate in the SEER program and / or the NPCR . These data ap - proach 100 % coverage of the US population in the most recent time period and were the source for the projected new cancer cases in 2016 and incidence rates by state and race / ethnicity . 9 , 10 Some of the data presented herein were previously published in volumes 1 and 2 of Cancer in North America : 2008 - 2012 . 11 , 12 All cancer cases were classiﬁed according to the Interna - tional Classiﬁcation of Diseases for Oncology except childhood and adolescent cancers , which were classiﬁed according to the International Classiﬁcation of Childhood Cancer ( ICCC ) . 13 Causes of death were classiﬁed according to the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases . 14 All incidence and death rates were age - standardized to the 2000 US standard population and expressed per 100 , 000 population , as calcu - lated by NCI’s SEER * Stat software ( version 8 . 2 . 1 ) . 15 The annual percent change in rates was quantiﬁed using NCI’s Joinpoint Regression Program ( version 4 . 2 . 0 . 2 ) . 16 Whenever possible , cancer incidence rates presented in this report were adjusted for delays in reporting , which occur because of a lag in case capture or data corrections . Delay adjustment has the largest effect on the most recent years of data for cancers that are frequently diagnosed in outpatient settings ( eg , melanoma , leukemia , and prostate cancer ) and provides a more accurate portrayal of the cancer burden in the most recent time period . 17 For example , the leukemia incidence rate for 2012 is 16 % higher after adjusting for reporting delays . 6 , 18 Projected Cancer Cases and Deaths in 2016 The most recent year for which incidence and mortality data are available lags 2 to 4 years behind the current year due to the time required for data collection , compilation , quality control , and dissemination . Therefore , we projected the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States in 2016 to provide an estimate of the contemporary cancer burden . The number of invasive cancer cases was estimated using a 3 - step spatio - temporal model based on high - quality incidence data from 49 states and the District of Columbia representing approximately 94 % population coverage ( data were lacking for all years for Minnesota and for some years for other states ) . First , complete incidence counts were estimated for each county from 1998 through 2012 using geographic variations in sociodemographic and lifestyle factors , medical settings , and cancer screening behaviors as predictors of incidence . 19 Then these counts were adjusted for delays in cancer reporting and aggregated to obtain national - and state - level estimates . Finally , a tem - poral projection method ( the vector autoregressive model ) was applied to the last 15 years of data to estimate counts for 2016 . This method cannot estimate numbers of basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers because data on the occur - rence of these cancers are not required to be reported to can - cer registries . For complete details of the case projection methodology , please refer to Zhu et al . 20 New cases of female breast carcinoma in situ and mela - noma in situ diagnosed in 2016 were calculated by ﬁrst approximating the number of cases occurring annually from 2003 through 2012 based on age - speciﬁc NAACCR inci - dence rates ( data from 44 states and the District of Colum - bia with high - quality data every year ) and US population estimates provided in SEER * Stat . The average annual per - cent change in case counts from 2003 through 2012 gener - ated by the joinpoint regression model was then used to project cases to 2016 . In contrast to previous years , the esti - mate for breast carcinoma in situ was not adjusted for reporting delays because delay - adjustment factors were not available . The number of cancer deaths expected to occur in 2016 was estimated based on the annual percent change in reported numbers of cancer deaths from 1998 through 2012 at the state and national levels as reported to the NCHS . For the com - plete details of this methodology , please refer to Chen et al . 21 Other Statistics The number of cancer deaths averted in men and women due to the reduction in overall cancer death rates was esti - mated by subtracting the number of recorded deaths from the number that would have been expected if cancer death rates had remained at their peak . The expected number of deaths was estimated by applying the 5 - year age - speciﬁc cancer death rates in the peak year for age - standardized cancer death rates ( 1990 in men and 1991 in women ) to the corresponding age - speciﬁc populations in subsequent years through 2012 . The difference between the number of expected and recorded cancer deaths in each age group and calendar year was then summed .

Cancer Statistics , 2016 4 CA : A Cancer Journal for Clinicians Selected Findings Expected Numbers of New Cancer Cases Table 1 presents the estimated numbers of new cases of invasive cancer expected in the United States in 2016 by sex . The overall estimate of 1 , 685 , 210 cases is the equiva - lent of more than 4 , 600 new cancer diagnoses each day . In addition , about 61 , 000 cases of female breast carci - noma in situ and 68 , 480 cases of melanoma in situ are expected to be diagnosed in 2016 . The estimated num - bers of new cases by state for selected cancer sites are shown in Table 2 . Figure 1 indicates the most common cancers expected to occur in men and women in 2016 . Prostate , lung and bron - chus , and colorectal cancers account for 44 % of all cases in men , with prostate cancer alone accounting for 1 in 5 new diagnoses . For women , the 3 most commonly diagnosed cancers are breast , lung and bronchus , and colorectum , rep - resenting one - half of all cases ; breast cancer alone is expected to account for 29 % all new cancer diagnoses in women . Expected Numbers of Cancer Deaths Table 1 also shows the expected numbers of cancer deaths in 2016 . It is estimated that 595 , 690 Americans will die from cancer this year , corresponding to about 1 , 600 deaths per day . The most common causes of cancer death are can - cers of the lung and bronchus , prostate , and colorectum in men and lung and bronchus , breast , and colorectum in women . These 4 cancers account for 46 % of all cancer deaths ( Fig . 1 ) , with more than one - quarter ( 27 % ) due to lung cancer .

Cancer Statistics , 2016 6 CA : A Cancer Journal for Clinicians Lifetime Probability of Developing Cancer The lifetime probability of being diagnosed with an inva - sive cancer is higher for men ( 42 % ) than for women ( 38 % ) ( Table 4 ) . Reasons for increased susceptibility in men are not well understood , but to some extent reﬂect differences in environmental exposures , endogenous hormones , and probably complex interactions between these inﬂuences . Adult height , which is determined by genetics and child - hood nutrition , is positively associated with cancer inci - dence and death in both men and women , 22 and has been estimated to account for one - third of the sex differences in cancer risk . 23 For adults aged younger than 50 years , how - ever , cancer risk is higher for women ( 5 . 4 % ) than for men ( 3 . 4 % ) because of the relatively high burden of breast , geni - tal , and thyroid cancers in young women . The estimated probability of developing cancer is based on the average experience of the general population and may over - or underestimate individual risk because of differences in exposure ( eg , smoking history ) , medical history , and / or genetic susceptibility . Trends in Cancer Incidence Figures 2 and 3 illustrate long - term trends in cancer inci - dence rates for all cancers combined and for selected cancer sites by sex . Cancer incidence patterns in the United States reﬂect trends in behaviors associated with cancer risk , improvements in cancer prevention and control , and changes in medical practice . Trends in overall incidence are driven by the 4 major cancers ( lung , breast , prostate , and colorectal ) . For example , the spike in incidence rates in men in the late 1980s and early 1990s ( Fig . 2 ) is due to the surge in detection of asymptomatic prostate cancer ( Fig . 3 ) as a result of widespread prostate - speciﬁc antigen ( PSA ) testing . 24 The increase in incidence in women during the TABLE 4 .

Joinpoint is a tool used to describe and quantify trends by ﬁtting observed rates to lines con - nected at “joinpoints” where trends change in direction or magnitude . 8 , 26 The overall incidence rate in women has remained stable since 1998 , but has declined in men by 3 . 1 % per year since 2009 . The recent rapid decline in pros - tate cancer diagnoses accounts for about one - half of the total decline in men . Routine screening with the PSA test is no longer recommended because of growing concerns about high rates of overdiagnosis , estimated at 23 % to 42 % for screen - detected cancers . 27 , 28 Despite declines in the prevalence of PSA screening from 2010 to 2013 , one - third of men aged 65 years and older with limited life expectancy were screened in 2013 . 29 Lung cancer incidence rates began declining in the mid - 1980s in men and in the mid - 2000s in women ( Fig . 3 ) as a result of reductions in smoking prevalence that began decades earlier . 30 Contemporary differences in lung cancer incidence patterns between men and women reﬂect histori - cal differences in tobacco use . Women took up smoking in large numbers later than men , ﬁrst initiated smoking at older ages , and were slower to quit , including recent upturns in smoking prevalence in some birth cohorts . 31 , 32 Declines in lung cancer incidence and death rates continue to be larger in men than in women ( Table 5 ) . The long - term declines in colorectal cancer incidence rates since the mid - 1980s have been attributed to both changes in risk factors and the introduction of screen - ing . 33 However , the recent rapid declines are likely driven by the increased uptake of screening with colono - scopy , which can prevent cancer by allowing for the removal of precancerous lesions . 34 , 35 Among adults aged 50 to 75 years , colonoscopy use increased from 19 % in 2000 to 55 % in 2013 . 36 Colorectal cancer incidence and death rates declined by about 3 % per year in both men and women from 2003 through 2012 , with momentum gaining in the most recent years ( Table 5 ) . However , rates increased by 1 . 8 % per year from 1992 through 2012 in men and women aged younger than 50 years , among whom screening is not recommended for those at average risk . 5 In contrast to stable or declining trends for most cancers , incidence rates increased from 2003 to 2012 ( SEER FIGURE 3 .

Five - Year Relative Survival Rates for Selected Cancers by Race and Stage at Diagnosis , United States , 2005 to 2011 . * The standard error of the survival rate is between 5 and 10 percentage points . † The survival rate for carcinoma in situ of the urinary bladder is 96 % in all races combined , 96 % in whites , and 90 % in blacks . Cancer Statistics , 2016 12 CA : A Cancer Journal for Clinicians underestimating true disease risk . A recent study found that incidence rates corrected for hysterectomy prevalence were 73 % higher among white women and 90 % higher among black women compared with uncorrected rates . 39 Thyroid cancer continues to be the most rapidly increas - ing cancer ( > 5 % per year in both men and women ) , par - tially due to overdiagnosis because of increased use of advanced imaging techniques . A recent study estimated that over the past 2 decades , about one - half of all papillary thyroid cancers diagnosed in women , and 40 % of those in men aged (cid:2) 50 years , were clinically irrelevant . 40 However , increases across tumor size and stage , as well as for follicular carcinoma ( a more aggressive subtype ) , suggest that some of the rise may be due to changes in environmental risk fac - tors , such as obesity . 41 – 43 Trends in Cancer Survival Over the past 3 decades , the 5 - year relative survival rate for all cancers combined has increased 20 percentage points among whites and 23 percentage points among blacks ( Table 6 ) . Progress has been most rapid for hema - topoietic and lymphoid malignancies due to improve - ments in treatment protocols , including the discovery of targeted therapies . For example , the 5 - year survival for acute lymphocytic leukemia increased from 41 % during the mid - 1970s to 70 % during 2005 to 2011 . The use of BCR - ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( eg , imatinib ) doubled survival for patients with chronic myeloid leuke - mia in less than 2 decades , 44 from 31 % in the early 1990s to 63 % during 2005 to 2011 . A recent study found that improvements in survival since 1990 for the most com - mon cancers have been much more pronounced among patients aged 50 to 64 years than among those aged older than 65 years . 45 This disparity may reﬂect differential care and / or lower efﬁcacy or use of new therapies in the elderly population . In contrast to the steady increase in survival for most cancers , advances have been slow for lung and pancreatic cancers , for which the 5 - year relative survival is currently 18 % and 8 % , respectively ( Table 6 ) . These low rates are partly because more than one - half of cases are diagnosed at a distant stage ( Fig . 5 ) , for which 5 - year survival is 4 % and 2 % , respectively ( Fig . 6 ) . There is promise for improving lung cancer survival rates because of earlier detection through screening with spiral computed tomography . 46 However , it is important to realize that screening , as well as other changes in detection practices , introduces lead time bias in survival rates , thereby reducing their usefulness in measuring progress against cancer . 47 For example , the jump in 5 - year relative survival rates for prostate cancer from 83 % in the late 1980s to 93 % in the early 1990s to 99 % since 2000 predominantly reﬂects lead time and overdetec - tion . Thus , advances against cancer are best measured using age - standardized death rates . 48 FIGURE 7 . Total Number of Cancer Deaths Averted From 1991 to 2012 in Men and From 1992 to 2012 in Women . The blue line represents the actual number of cancer deaths recorded in each year , and the red line represents the number of cancer deaths that would have been expected if cancer death rates had remained at their peak . CA CANCER J CLIN 2015 ; 00 : 00 – 00 VOLUME 00 _ NUMBER 00 _ MONTH 2015 13 Trends in Cancer Mortality The overall cancer death rate rose during most of the 20th century , largely driven by rapid increases in lung cancer deaths among men as a consequence of the tobacco epi - demic . Steady reductions in smoking , as well as advances in cancer prevention , early detection , and treatment , have resulted in a 23 % drop in the cancer death rate , from a peak of 215 . 1 ( per 100 , 000 population ) in 1991 to 166 . 4 in 2012 . The decline , which is larger in men ( 28 % since 1990 ) than in women ( 19 % since 1991 ) , translates into the avoidance of approximately 1 , 711 , 300 cancer deaths ( 1 , 199 , 200 in men and 512 , 100 in women ) that would have occurred if peak rates had persisted ( Fig . 7 ) . Figure 8 depicts trends in cancer death rates since 1930 among men and women overall and for selected cancer sites by sex . In contrast to male cancer death rates , which rose continuously prior to 1990 , female cancer death rates fell from the late 1940s to the mid - 1970s ( Fig . 8A ) . It is inter - esting to note that prior to 1941 , death rates were higher in women than in men due to the high death rate for uterine cancer ( uterine corpus and uterine cervix combined ) , which was the leading cause of cancer death among women in the FIGURE 8 .

CA CANCER J CLIN 2015 ; 00 : 00 – 00 VOLUME 00 _ NUMBER 00 _ MONTH 2015 15 early 20th century . Uterine cancer death rates declined by more than 80 % between 1930 and 2012 ( Fig . 8C ) , largely due to the widespread uptake of the Papanicolaou test for the prevention and early detection of cervical cancer . How - ever , in contrast to continuing declines for cancers of the uterine cervix , death rates for uterine corpus cancer began to increase around 2000 in the wake of rising incidence rates ( Fig . 8C , inset ) ( Table 5 ) . 8 A similarly dramatic decline occurred for stomach can - cer , which accounted for 30 % and 20 % of male and female cancer deaths , respectively , in the 1930s , but only about 2 % for each in 2012 . Although reasons for the decrease in stomach cancer occurrence in the United States and most other parts of the world are complex and not completely understood , contributors are thought to include a lower prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection because of improved hygiene and lower salt intake and a higher con - sumption of fresh fruits and vegetables because of advan - ces in food preservation techniques ( eg , refrigeration ) . 49 However , studies indicate that incidence rates for certain subtypes of stomach cancer are increasing for some sub - sets of the US population for reasons that remain unknown . 50 , 51 The decline in cancer death rates over the past 2 decades is driven by continued decreases in death rates for the 4 major cancer sites ( lung , breast , prostate , and colorectum ) . Death rates for female breast cancer are down 36 % from peak rates , and those for prostate and colorectal cancers are each down about 50 % as a result of improvements in early detection and treatment . 8 , 33 , 52 , 53 Lung cancer death rates declined 38 % between 1990 and 2012 among males and 13 % between 2002 and 2012 among females 8 due to reduced tobacco use as a result of increased awareness of the health hazards of smoking and the implementation of comprehensive tobacco control . 54 Researchers recently esti - mated that tobacco control efforts adopted in the wake of the ﬁrst Surgeon General’s report on smoking and health in 1964 have resulted in 8 million fewer premature smoking - related deaths , one - third of which are due to cancer . 55 , 56 Despite this progress , 80 % of deaths from lung cancer and one - half of all deaths from cancers of the oral cavity , esoph - agus , and urinary bladder are caused by smoking . 57 TABLE 8 .

Thyroid cancer death rates also increased slightly in men , from 0 . 43 ( per 100 , 000 population ) in 2003 to 0 . 51 in 2012 . Recorded Number of Deaths in 2012 A total of 2 , 543 , 279 deaths were recorded in the United States in 2012 , of which 582 , 623 ( 23 % ) were from cancer . Overall , cancer is the second leading cause of death follow - ing heart disease , which accounted for 24 % of total deaths . However , cancer is the leading cause of death among adults aged 40 to 79 years ( Table 7 ) . It is also the leading cause of death in 21 states ( Alaska , Arizona , Colorado , Delaware , Florida , Georgia , Idaho , Kansas , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , Montana , Nebraska , New Hampshire , New FIGURE 9 .

In Minnesota , for example , the death rate for heart disease is 30 % below the national average ( 118 vs 170 per 100 , 000 population ) compared with a 6 % lower death rate for can - cer . In addition , cancer is the leading cause of death among both Hispanics and Asian / Paciﬁc Islanders ( APIs ) , who combined comprise one - quarter of the US population . 58 Table 8 presents the number of deaths from all cancers combined and from the 5 most common sites for each 20 - year age group by sex . More cancer deaths occur in men than in women except for those aged 20 to 39 years and 80 years or older . Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women aged 20 to 59 years , but is replaced by lung cancer in women aged 60 years or older . Among men , lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for those aged 40 years or older . Among children and adolescents ( aged birth to 19 years ) , brain cancer has surpassed leukemia as the leading cause of cancer death ( Table 8 ) .

From 1970 to 2012 , the death rate in this age group declined by 76 % for leukemia compared with 31 % for tumors of the brain and other nervous system ( Fig . 9A ) . This progress has occurred despite a slow increase in the incidence of both cancer types over this time period ( in the 9 oldest SEER areas ) ( Fig . 9C ) . Since the mid - 1970s , the 5 - year relative survival rate has increased from 50 % to 87 % for leukemia and from 57 % to 74 % for brain and other nervous system tumors . 8 Cancer Occurrence by Race / Ethnicity Cancer incidence and death rates vary considerably between and within racial and ethnic groups . For example , among men in the 5 broadly deﬁned population groups in Table 9 , black men have the highest overall cancer incidence and death rates - about double those of API men , who have the lowest rates . Rates are higher among black than non - Hispanic white men for every site included in Table 9 with the exception of kidney cancer mortality , for which rates are similar . The largest disparities are for stomach and prostate cancers , for which death rates in black men are about 2 . 5 times those in white men . Factors known to contribute to racial disparities vary by cancer site and include differences in risk factor prevalence and access to high - quality health care , including cancer prevention and early detection , timely diagnosis , and opti - mal treatment . 60 , 61 Even among Medicare - insured patients , blacks are less likely than whites to receive standard - cancer therapies for lung , breast , colorectal , and prostate cancers . 62 A major source of these inequalities is the disproportion - ately high burden of poverty in the black community . According to the US Census Bureau , 26 % of blacks lived in poverty and 12 % were without health insurance in 2014 , compared with 10 % and 8 % , respectively , of non - Hispanic whites . Higher mortality rates among blacks compared with whites partly reﬂect a later stage of disease at diagnosis . This disparity is particularly striking for cancers of the uter - ine corpus , oral cavity , female breast , and cervix ( Fig . 5 ) . Moreover , black patients have lower stage - speciﬁc survival for most cancer types ( Fig . 6 ) . As a result , although black women have a lower breast cancer incidence rate than white women , they have a higher breast cancer death rate ( Table 9 ) . The historically higher incidence rate among white women is thought to reﬂect a combination of factors that affect both diagnosis ( more prevalent mammography ) and underlying disease occurrence ( such as later age at ﬁrst birth and greater use of menopausal hormone therapy ) . 63 However , a recent study reported that breast cancer inci - dence rates in white and black women are converging because of a stable trend in whites but an increasing trend in blacks . 64 The higher risk of death from breast cancer among black women is thought to reﬂect a higher preva - lence of comorbidities , a longer time to follow - up after an abnormal mammogram , less receipt of high - quality treat - ment , higher body mass index , and a higher prevalence of aggressive tumor characteristics . 65 – 68 However , an analysis of clinical trial data showed that black women were less likely than white women to survive their breast cancer despite uni - form treatment , even after controlling for stage of disease , tumor characteristics , follow - up , and socioeconomic status . 69 Cancer incidence and death rates are lower among APIs , American Indians / Alaska Natives ( AI / ANs ) , and His - panics than non - Hispanic whites for all cancer sites com - bined and for the 4 most common cancer sites . However , cancers associated with infectious agents ( eg , those of the uterine cervix , stomach , and liver ) are generally more TABLE 12 .

CA CANCER J CLIN 2015 ; 00 : 00 – 00 VOLUME 00 _ NUMBER 00 _ MONTH 2015 21 common in nonwhite populations . For example , stomach and liver cancer incidence and death rates are twice as high in the API population as in whites , reﬂecting a higher prev - alence of chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori and hep - atitis B virus , respectively , in immigrant countries of origin . 70 Kidney cancer incidence and death rates are high - est among AI / ANs , which may be due in part to high rates of obesity , smoking , and hypertension in this population . Regional variation in the prevalence of these risk factors likely contributes to the striking geographic differences in kidney cancer death rates among AI / AN men , which are highest in the Southern and Northern Plains and lowest in the East and Paciﬁc Coast . 71 Regional Variations in Cancer Rates Tables 10 and 11 depict current cancer incidence and death rates for selected cancers by state . Geographic patterns in cancer occurrence reﬂect differences in risk factors , such as smoking and obesity , as well as disparities in the national distribution of poverty and access to health care , which have increased over time . 72 , 73 The largest geographic varia - tion in cancer occurrence by far is for lung cancer , reﬂecting the large historical and continuing differences in smoking prevalence among states . 54 For example , lung cancer inci - dence rates in Kentucky , which has historically had the highest smoking prevalence , are 3 . 5 times higher than those in Utah , which has the lowest smoking prevalence . There is a 2 - fold difference for prostate cancer incidence rates , which range from 89 . 8 ( per 100 , 000 population ) in Arizona to 184 . 1 in the District of Columbia , likely reﬂecting both state differences in PSA testing prevalence and population demographics . 24 In contrast , state variations for other can - cer types are smaller in both absolute and relative terms . For example , breast cancer incidence rates range from 107 . 7 ( per 100 , 000 population ) in Arkansas to 141 . 7 in the District of Columbia , a relative difference of just 24 % . Some of this variation is attributable to differences in mam - mography prevalence . 74 Cancer in Children Cancer is the second most common cause of death among children aged 1 to 14 years in the United States , surpassed only by accidents . In 2016 , an estimated 10 , 380 children ( birth to 14 years ) will be diagnosed with cancer ( excluding benign / borderline brain tumors ) and 1 , 250 will die from the disease . Benign and borderline brain tumors are not included in the 2016 case estimates because the calculation method requires historical data and these tumors were not required to be reported until 2004 . Leukemia ( 76 % of which are lymphoid leukemias ) accounts for 30 % of all childhood cancers ( including benign brain tumors ) . Cancers of the brain and other nervous system are the second most common cancer type ( 26 % ) , followed by soft tissue sarcomas ( 7 % , almost one - half of which are rhabdomy - osarcoma ) , neuroblastoma ( 6 % ) , non - Hodgkin lymphomas , including Burkitt lymphoma ( 6 % ) , renal ( Wilms ) tumors ( 5 % ) , and Hodgkin lymphomas ( 3 % ) . 8 Cancers in adolescents ( aged 15 to 19 years ) differ somewhat from those in children in terms of type and distribution . For example , a smaller proportion of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents are leukemias and a larger proportion are lymphomas . Cancers of the brain and other nervous system are most common ( 20 % ) , fol - lowed by leukemia ( 14 % ) , Hodgkin lymphoma ( 13 % ) , gonadal germ cell tumors ( 12 % ) , and thyroid carcinoma ( 11 % ) . Melanoma accounts for 4 % of the cancers diag - nosed in this age group . Cancer incidence rates increased in children and ado - lescents by 0 . 6 % per year from 1975 through 2012 . In contrast , death rates have declined continuously , from 6 . 5 ( per 100 , 000 population ) in 1970 to 2 . 4 in 2012 , an over - all reduction of 63 % ( 65 % in children and 60 % in adoles - cents ) . Table 12 provides trends in survival rates for the most common childhood cancers . The 5 - year relative sur - vival rate for all cancer sites combined improved from 58 % for children diagnosed during 1975 to 1977 to 83 % for those diagnosed during 2005 to 2011 . The substantial progress for all of the major childhood cancers reﬂects both improvements in treatment and high levels of partic - ipation in clinical trials . 59 Limitations Although the numbers of cancer cases and deaths expected in 2016 provide a reasonably accurate portrayal of the contemporary cancer burden , they are model - based , 4 - year - ahead projections that should be inter - preted with caution and not be used to track trends over time . First , the estimates may be affected by changes in methodology , which are implemented regularly as mod - eling techniques improve and surveillance coverage becomes more complete . Second , although the model is robust , it can only account for trends through the most recent year of data ( currently 2012 ) and cannot antici - pate abrupt ﬂuctuations for cancers affected by changes in detection practice , such as prostate cancer . Third , the model can be oversensitive to sudden or large changes in observed data . The most informative indicators of cancer trends are age - standardized or age - speciﬁc cancer death rates from the NCHS and cancer incidence rates from SEER , NPCR , and / or NAACCR . Errors in reporting race / ethnicity in medical records and on death certiﬁcates may result in underestimates of cancer incidence and mortality rates in nonwhite and nonblack populations . This is particularly relevant for AI / AN populations . Cancer Statistics , 2016 22 CA : A Cancer Journal for Clinicians It is also important to note that cancer data in the United States are primarily reported for broad , heterogeneous racial and ethnic groups , masking important differences in the cancer burden within these subpopulations . Conclusions The continuous decline in cancer death rates over 2 decades has resulted in an overall drop of 23 % , resulting in more than 1 . 7 million cancer deaths averted . Despite this pro - gress , cancer is now the leading cause of death for much of the US population . Moreover , incidence and death rates are increasing for several cancer types , including liver and pancreas—2 of the most fatal cancers . Advancing the ﬁght against cancer will require continued clinical and basic research , which is dependent on funding , as well as the application of existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population , with an emphasis on disadvan - taged groups .
