MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS 14 : 218 - 224 , 2016 218 Abstract . Osteoblasts have the capacity to perceive and transduce mechanical signals , and thus , regulate the mRNA and protein expression of a variety of genes associated with osteogenesis . Cytoskeletal reconstruction , as one of the earliest perception events for external mechanical stimulation , has previously been demonstrated to be essential for mechano - transduction in bone cells . However , the mechanism by which mechanical signals induce cytoskeletal deformation remains poorly understood . The actin‑binding protein , cofilin , promotes the depolymerization of actin and is understood to be important in the regulation of activities in various cell types , including endothelial , neuronal and muscle cells . However , to the best of our knowledge , the importance of cofilin in osteoblastic mechanotransduction has not been previously investigated . In the present study , osteoblast - like MG - 63 cells were subjected to physiological cyclic stretch stimulation ( 12 % elongation ) for 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 and 24 h , and the expression levels of cofilin and osteogenesis - associated genes were quantified with reverse transcription - quantitative polymerase chain reaction , immunofluorescence staining and western blotting analyses . Additionally , knockdown of cofilin using RNA interference was conducted , and the mRNA levels of osteogenesis - associ - ated genes were compared between osteoblast - like cells in the presence and absence of cofilin gene knockdown . The results of the present study demonstrated that cyclic stretch stimulates the expression of genes associated with osteoblastic activities in MG - 63 cells , including alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , osteo - calcin ( OCN ) , runt - related transcription factor 2 ( Runx2 ) and collagen - 1 ( COL - 1 ) . Cyclic stretch also regulates the mRNA and protein expression of cofilin in MG‑63 cells . Furthermore , stretch - induced increases in the levels of osteogenesis - asso - ciated genes , including ALP , OCN , Runx2 and COL - 1 , were reduced following cofilin gene knockdown . Together , these results demonstrate that cofilin is involved in the regulation of mechanical load - induced osteogenesis and , to the best of our knowledge , provides the first evidence demonstrating the importance of cofilin in osteoblastic mechanotransduction . Introduction Normal bone is maintained in a dynamic state of equilibrium between osseous absorption and reconstruction . The process of bone remodeling is associated with the coordinated regulation of bone - resorbing osteoclasts and bone - forming osteoblasts ( 1 ) . Weight - bearing mechanical loading is essential for maintaining the balance of bone metabolism . Substantial studies have confirmed that physiological cyclic loading effectively promotes bone mass and maintains the optimiza - tion of skeletal structures , and the lack of mechanical stimuli to the skeleton leads to lower bone formation and inferior bone quality ( 2 ) . Numerous experiments have demonstrated that bone cells ( including osteoblasts and osteocytes ) secrete various essential cytokines ( including Ca 2 + , prostaglandin E 2 and nitric oxide ) in response to various physiological mechan - ical stimuli , including fluid shear stress ( 3 ) , compressive force and cyclic stretch ( 4 - 6 ) . However , how bone cells sense the external mechanical signals and , thus , transduce the them into intracellular biochemical signals remains unclear , which is regarded as an important question for deciphering the mecha - nisms of bone mechanotransduction and adaptation . The cytoskeleton is a network of protein filaments that modulate cellular shape , motility and mechanical proper - ties ( 7 ) . Cytoskeletal deformation is believed to be one of the earliest cellular events in response to mechanical stimuli , and is involved in regulating transmembrane signal transduction ( 6 ) . Cyclic stretch promotes osteogenesis - related gene expression in osteoblast - like cells through a cofilin - associated mechanism JIE GAO 1 * , SHANMIN FU 1 * , ZHAOBIN ZENG 2 , FEIFEI LI 1 , QIANNAN NIU 1 , DA JING 3 and XUE FENG 1 1 State Key Laboratory of Military Stomatology , Department of Orthodontics , School of Stomatology , Fourth Military Medical University , Xi ' an , Shaanxi 710032 ; 2 Department of Stomatology , General Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command , Shenyang , Liaoning 110084 ; 3 Department of Biomedical Engineering , Fourth Military Medical University , Xi ' an , Shaanxi 710032 , P .

The actin - based cytoskeleton has previously been demonstrated to be important for the biochemical response of bone cells to mechanical loading ( 8 ) . A previous study demonstrated that the deformed actin cytoskeletal network provided enhanced docking and activation sites for kinases ( 9 ) . Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton impaired the ability of bone cells to respond to fluid shear stress , and enhanced actin polymeriza - tion increases osteogenic differentiation ( 10 ) . However , the key signaling pathways that mediate cyclic strain - induced osteoblastic cytoskeletal deformation and rearrangement have not been fully elucidated , which is critical for understanding the mechanism of how the bone cell cytoskeleton responds to external mechanical signals . Osteoblast cytoskeletal reconstruction depends on the regu - lation of mechanosensitive proteins . Cofilin is an actin‑binding protein that is essential for the depolymerization of actin fila - ments ( 11 , 12 ) . When an actin filament is activated , cofilin can sever the actin filament , and in turn increase the polymerization of muscle actin monomers ( 13 ) . A previous study demonstrated that Rho small GTPase , and its downstream effector molecules , regulate the cyclic strain - induced migration of vascular smooth muscle cells ( 9 ) . This mechanism is notable because Rho is a major organizer of the cytoskeleton ( 14 ) and can regulate the formation of actin stress fibers by activating Rho‑associated coiled - coil containing protein kinase 1 ( ROCK ) , which in turn phosphorylates cofilin . LIM domain kinase ( LIMK ) can regulate actin dynamics through the phosphorylation of cofilin ( 15 ) . Thus , Rho regulates cofilin via ROCK and LIMK , and this signal transduction pathway modulates actin assembly in various cell types in response to numerous extracellular stimuli . Cofilin binds to actin monomers and polymers , and promotes the disassembly of actin filaments ( 16 ) . These obser - vations led to the hypothesis that the cofilin signaling pathway may be important for osteoblastic mechanosensing leading to the cytoskeletal rearrangement of osteoblasts . Thus , in the present study , the role of cofilin in regulating cyclic stretch - induced osteogenesis was investigated in human osteoblast - like MG - 63 cells , which are derived from osteosar - comas and exhibit various osteoblast - like characteristics ( 17 ) . MG - 63 cells were subjected to physiological cyclic strain stimulation ( 12 % elongation ) , and the expression levels of cofilin and osteogenesis‑associated genes were quantified with reverse transcription - quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT‑qPCR ) , immunofluorescence staining and western blot - ting analysis . Additionally , RNA interference ( RNAi ) was performed to knockdown cofilin expression , and the expres - sion levels of osteogenesis - associated genes were evaluated . Materials and methods Cell culture . Human osteoblast - like MG - 63 cells ( RIKEN BioResource Center , Tsukuba , Japan ) were maintained in a logarithmic growth phase in a hybrid modified Eagle ' s medium ( Hyclone ; GE Healthcare Life Sciences , Logan , UT , USA ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Gibco ; Thermo Fisher Scientific , Inc . , Waltham , MA , USA ) and 10 µg / ml insulin‑transferring‑selenium ( Gibco ; Thermo Fisher Scientific , Inc . ) . Cells were cultured at 37˚C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 . Cells were initially seeded at 6x10 4 cells / well density in 6 - well plates . The medium was replaced every 2 days . Mechanical stretch stimulation . MG - 63 cells were plated in collagen II coated 6‑well BioFlex culture plates with elastic bottom ( Flexcell International Corporation , Burlington , NC , USA ) and incubated for 24 h . Cells were subjected to cyclic stretch with 12 % elongation at 0 . 1 Hz ( 5 sec stretch / 5 sec relaxation ) using FX‑4000 Tension System ( Flexcell Interna - tional Corporation ) and harvested for biochemical assays at 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 and 24 h after the application of mechanical stretch . The control groups were seeded on the same plates and main - tained in the same experimental condition without applying mechanical stretch . Total RNA extraction and RT‑qPCR . Following mechanical stretching , total RNA was extracted using TRIzol ( Gibco ; Thermo Fisher Scientific , Inc . ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions , and quantified with a NanoDrop 2000c spec - trophotometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Inc . ) . First‑strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the High Capacity cDNA Archive kit ( Applied Biosystems ; Thermo Fisher Scien - tific , Inc . ) according to the manufacturer ' s protocol .

The sequences of all primers were designed by Takara Biotechnology Co . , Ltd . ( Dalian , China ) . qPCR was performed on 1 µl cDNA in a 20 µl reaction with SYBR Premix Ex Taq II ( Takara Biotechnology Co . , Ltd . ) using the Bio‑Rad CFX96 real - time PCR detection system ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Inc . Hercules , CA , USA ) . GAPDH was used as an internal control for normalization . The relative quantity of mRNA was calculated using the 2 - ΔΔ Cq method ( 18 ) . Triplicate RT - qPCR reactions were preformed using three separate samples . Protein extraction and western blot analysis . Following cyclic stretch loading , cells were washed once with ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline immediately and lysed in 500 µl sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) buffer . Samples were then boiled at 95˚C for 5 min . The protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Inc . ) . Subsequently , 10 µl protein aliquots were subjected to electrophoretic separation by Tris - glycine SDS‑polyacrylamide gel ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Inc . ) electrophoresis ( 10 % resolving gel ) and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes ( Bio‑Rad Laboratories , MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS 14 : 218 - 224 , 2016 220 Inc . ) . The membranes were blocked in Tris - buffered saline ( 0 . 5 % Tween - 20 ) containing 5 % bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 4˚C . The membranes were incubated with monoclonal rabbit anti‑cofilin ( 1 : 700 ; cat . no . 5175 ; Cell Signaling Technology , Inc . , Danvers , MA , USA ) , monoclonal rabbit anti‑phospho‑cofilin ( 1 : 500 ; cat . no . 3313 ; Cell Signaling Technology , Inc . ) and monoclonal rabbit anti - GAPDH ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; cat . no . 2118 ; Cell Signaling Technology , Inc . ) anti - bodies overnight at 4˚C , and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - rabbit secondary antibodies ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; cat . no . AP307P ; EMD Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) for 1 h at room temperature . Images for western blot analysis were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence system ( GE ImageQuant 350 , GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) . Semi - quantitative analysis was performed using the Quanti - tyOne software ( version 4 . 6 . 3 ; Bio‑Rad Laboratories , Inc . ) . GAPDH was used as an internal control for normalization . Immunofluorescence staining . Following stimulation with cyclic stretch , cells in BioFlex culture plates were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature . The elastic bottom of each plate was cut into 8 - 10 pieces , which were then blocked in 2 % goat serum ( Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology , Haimen , China ) in phosphate - buffered saline at 37˚C for 1 h . Following blocking , the cells were incubated with monoclonal rabbit anti‑active cofilin primary antibody ( 1 : 100 ; cat . no . 5175 ; Cell Signaling Technology , Inc . ) for 1 h . Cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG secondary antibody ( 1 : 500 ; cat . no . 65‑6111 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific , Inc . ) for 1 h and counterstained with 4 ' , 6‑diamidino‑2‑phe - nylindole for 5 min at room temperature . Cells were then visualized with an FV1200 laser scanning confocal micro - scope ( Olympus Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) . Six fields of view were randomly selected and the number of cells exhibiting nuclear translocation of cofilin were counted and normalized to the total number of cells in each field . Cofilin RNAi knockdown . Different cofilin short hairpin ( sh ) RNA fragments ( GeneCopoeia , Inc . , Rockville , MD , USA ) were designed to achieve a low cofilin protein expression model . The shRNA sequences used are as follows : No . 1 , GGA CAA GAA GAA CAT CATC ; no . 2 , CCT ACG CCA CCT TTG TCAA ; no . 3 , TGT GCG GCT CCT ACT AAAC ; no . 4 , ATG CTG CCA ACT TCT AACC ; and no . 5 , blank shRNA sequence ( control cells ) . Cells were transfected with shRNA and pMIR - REPORT luciferase reporter vector ( Promega Corporation , Madison , WI , USA ) mixture using Lipo - fectamine 2000 liposome transfection reagent ( Invitrogen ; Thermo Fisher Scientific , Inc . ) according to the manufac - turer ' s instructions . Briefly , 50‑100 nM shRNA was mixed with the luciferase reporter vector and transfection reagent , and the mix was added to MG‑63 cells ( 50‑60 % confluence ) . After transfection for 24 - 36 h , cells were harvested to deter - mine the cofilin mRNA and protein expression levels via RT - qPCR and western blot analysis , respectively . Statistical analysis . All data presented are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation . Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software , version 16 . 0 ( SPSS , Inc . , Chicago , IL , USA ) . One - way analysis of variance with Tukey ' s post hoc analysis was used to determine the differ - ences between groups . P < 0 . 05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference . Results Cyclic stretch increases the expression of genes associated with osteoblastic activities in MG‑63 cells . As demonstrated in Fig . 1 , cyclic stretch for 1 , 4 , 8 and 12 h significantly increased ALP mRNA expression compared with control ( P < 0 . 05 ) . OCN and Runx2 mRNA expression levels were also significantly increased following 1 , 4 , 8 and 12 h cyclic stretch stimulation compared with control ( P < 0 . 05 ) . Furthermore , stretch for 1 , 4 , 8 and 12 h also significantly increased the mRNA expression levels of COL - 1 compared with control ( P < 0 . 05 ) . Cyclic stretch regulates the gene and protein expression of cofilin in osteoblast‑like MG‑63 cells . Western blot analysis ( Fig . 2A ) demonstrated that cofilin protein expression was increased within the first 4 h of mechanical strain application compared with control ( P < 0 . 01 ) . Following 8 , 12 or 24 h of stretch stimulation , cofilin protein expression was decreased compared with the 4 h stimulation group ( P < 0 . 05 ) , whereas it remained significantly higher compared with the control group ( P < 0 . 01 ; Fig . 2B ) . Furthermore , following cyclic stretch for 1 , 4 , 8 and 12 h the phosphorylation levels of cofilin were significantly decreased compared with control ( P < 0 . 05 ) , whereas cofilin phosphorylation was significantly increased at 24 h stretch compared with control ( P < 0 . 01 ; Fig . 2C ) . However , as presented in Fig . 2D , cofilin mRNA expression levels demonstrated no significant change compared with control following cyclic stretch stimulation for 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 or 24 h ( P > 0 . 05 ) . Additionally , the regulatory effects of cyclic stretch on cofilin protein expression were further confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis , which demonstrated that cofilin protein expression was increased under 4 h cyclic stretch compared with control . Stretch‑induced increases in osteoblast‑associated genes are suppressed by cofilin gene knockdown . Immunofluorescence was preformed to detect cofilin protein expression levels in osteoblast - like MG - 63 cells transfected with different shRNA fragments ( Fig . 3A ) . Compared with control shRNA , the four different cofilin shRNAs significantly reduced the expression of cofilin at the mRNA level ( P < 0 . 01 ; Fig . 3B ) , whereas no significant difference between each shRNA was observed ( P > 0 . 05 ; Fig . 3B ) . Western blot results demon - strated that shRNAs no . 1 and 4 significantly reduced the protein expression level of cofilin ( P < 0 . 01 ) , indicating that shRNAs no . 1 and 4 effectively inhibited the expression of cofilin ( Fig . 3C and D ) . Therefore , shRNA no . 1 was used to knockdown cofilin expression in osteoblast - like cells . As demonstrated in Fig . 4 , cofilin inhibition by shRNA significantly decreased the ALP mRNA expression levels compared with the levels under mechanical stretch ( P < 0 . 01 ) . Furthermore , the mRNA expression levels of OCN , Runx2 and COL - 1 were also significantly decreased by cofilin knockdown compared with the levels under mechanical stretch . GAO et al : CYCLIC STRETCH PROMOTES OSTEOGENESIS VIA COFILIN 221 Discussion Cyclic strain has previously been demonstrated to regulate various aspects of cellular activity , including cell proliferation , migration and cytoskeletal arrangement in a number of cell types , including fibroblasts , endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells ( 4 , 19 , 20 ) .

However , the mechanisms by which bone cells sense the external mechanical stimuli and transduce them into intracellular biochemical signals remain poorly understood ( 21 ) . Understanding mechanotransduction in bone cells has significant clinical implications for diseases involving dysfunctional bone remodeling ( including osteopo - rosis and osteopetrosis ) , and is also beneficial for understanding the mechanisms that underlie treatments associated with mechanical stimulation ( such as distraction osteogenesis ) . Several previous studies have demonstrated that the defor - mation of cytoskeletal components , including F‑actin and microtubules , is an essential early perception event for bone cells to sense external mechanical stimulations ( 8 , 22 , 23 ) . Cofilin is a regulator of actin filament non - equilibrium assembly and disassembly ( 24 , 25 ) . The promotional effects of cofilin on actin assembly or disassembly depend upon the concentration of cofilin relative to actin and other actin - binding proteins ( 26 ) . The results of these previous studies reveal that cofilin may be closely associated with intracellular signal transduction . However , the function of cofilin in osteoblastic activities and osteoblastic mechano - transduction has rarely been investigated . The findings of the present study demonstrate that cyclic strain significantly Figure 3 . Cofilin shRNA fragments inhibit stretch‑induced cofilin activation in osteoblast‑like MG‑63 cells .

A B C D A B C D GAO et al : CYCLIC STRETCH PROMOTES OSTEOGENESIS VIA COFILIN 223 promotes cofilin activation , and inhibition of cofilin signifi - cantly reduced the expression of osteogenesis - associated genes in response to mechanical loading . Thus , the results of the current study clearly demonstrated that cofilin was involved in mechanical load - induced osteogenesis and , to the best of our knowledge , provides the first evidence demonstrating that cofilin is important for osteoblastic mechanotransduction . Mechanical loading regulates the gene expression of cells in various organs , including bone , cartilage and liga - ments ( 27 ) . Several previous studies have also demonstrated that mechanical stretch stimulates the expression of a variety of osteogenesis - associated genes , including OCN , Runx2 , ALP , and COL - I and III ( 28 , 29 ) . In accordance with these previous findings , the present results also demonstrated that cyclic mechanical stretch with 12 % elongation significantly promoted the mRNA expression of osteogenesis - associated genes , including ALP , OCN , COL - 1 and Runx2 . Furthermore , significant increases in ALP and OCN mRNA expression were detected even at 1 h post - mechanical stimulation , indi - cating that ALP and OCN acted as major early sensitive genes for detecting and responding to external mechanical signals . The COL - 1 and Runx2 mRNA expression levels peaked at 4 h following the application of cyclic stretch , which suggested that the changes in COL - 1 and Runx2 gene expression levels may not be early intracellular biochemical events in the response of cyclic stretch . These findings are consistent with previous investigations ( 4 , 28 , 30 ) . The mechanism by which osteoblasts convert mechanical strain into biochemical signals remains unclear . A previous proteomic analysis on low shear stress - induced vascular remodeling demonstrated that Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor α responds to shear stress , and modulates vascular smooth muscle cell migration and apoptosis ( 9 ) . Furthermore , Lin et al ( 31 ) demonstrated that shear stress activates the Rho‑ROCK‑LIMK‑cofilin pathway and , thus , regulates the activity of endothelial cells . There - fore , it was hypothesized that the Rho‑ROCK‑LIMK‑cofilin pathway may be involved in intracellular signal transduction of osteoblasts in response to external mechanical signals . The findings of the current study clearly demonstrated that cyclic strain for 1 and 4 h significantly upregulated the protein expression levels of cofilin in osteoblast‑like MG‑63 cells subjected to cyclic stretch compared with the control group , whereas the cofilin expression was downregulated after 8 h cyclic stretch compared with the 4 h group but remained higher than the control group . Additionally , cofilin phos - phorylation was downregulated after 1 , 4 , 8 and 12 h , and upregulated at 24 h of mechanical stretch compared with the control group . Pan et al ( 27 ) demonstrated that cyclic strain increases the phosphorylation of cofilin over 24 h . The find - ings of the current study demonstrated that cyclic strain for 24 h increased the level of phospho‑cofilin , whereas at the early time points of cyclic strain , the level of phospho‑cofilin was decreased . This may be a result of mechanical strain activating cofilin expression at the early stages , but with the increasing cofilin levels , Rho and ROCK upregulated LIMK to increase the phosphorylation of cofilin in response to mechanical strain , which caused the reduced expression of cofilin over time ( 15 , 31 , 32 ) . Using shRNA - targeted transfec - tion technology , decreased cofilin expression resulted in a significant reduction in the mRNA expression levels of osteo - genesis - associated genes ( ALP , OCN , COL - 1 and Runx2 ) . The increase in osteogenesis - associated gene expression upon the application of mechanical strain in the present study further confirms the close association between cofilin and osteogenic functions induced by mechanical strain . In addition , the simultaneous increases in cofilin phosphorylation activation indicate that the Rho‑ROCK‑LIMK‑cofilin signaling pathway is important for mechanotransduction and the regulation of osteogenesis functions in response to cyclic strain . However , it will be important to further explore the specific functions and effects of cofilin on osteoblastic cytoskeletal deformation and reconstruction in response to mechanical signals in future studies . Actin is recognized to be essential for chromatin remod - eling , formation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes and gene expressions ( 33 , 34 ) . However , the actin amino acid sequence lacks a nuclear translocation signal , and as a 42 - kDa protein , is unlikely to enter the nucleus by diffu - sion . Thus , it relies on transporter proteins ( such as cofilin ) to mediate this entry , which may be promoted by a variety of adverse cellular conditions , including heat shock ( 35 , 36 ) and ATP depletion ( 37 ) . Thus , the current study considered that the ability to enable actin nuclear functions is one of the crucial cellular functions of cofilin in response to external stimuli , such as cyclic strain . Using immunofluorescent staining , the present study observed that cofilin was translo - cated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after 1 h mechanical loading , indicating that cofilin may bind actin and enter the nucleus Thus , mechanical strain , as an external stimuli , induced a protective effect via cofilin cytoskeletal‑binding protein . However , more detailed analyses of these protein events are necessary to improve our understanding of cofilin functions . In summary , the findings of the present study demonstrated that cyclic strain promotes the mRNA expression of osteo - genesis‑associated genes and also regulates cofilin protein expression levels . Furthermore , stretch‑induced increases of osteogenesis - associated genes , including ALP , OCN , Runx2 and COL1 , are reduced by cofilin gene knockdown . These results demonstrate that cofilin is involved in the regulation of mechanical load - induced osteogenesis , and to the best of our knowledge , provide the first evidence that cofilin is involved in osteoblastic mechanotransduction .
