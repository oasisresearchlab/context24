A R T I C L E I N F O Keywords : Polymer brush Nanoindentation Porelasticity A B S T R A C T A sound understanding of the ﬂ uid - con ﬁ nement mechanics of soft materials , including polymer brushes or hydrogels , is essential for developing advanced biomedical and engineering applications such as contact lenses or low - friction coatings . In order to elucidate the e ﬀ ect of polymer - chain density on ﬂ uid con ﬁ nement in thin ﬁ lms , gradients of poly ( dodecyl methacrylate ) ( P12MA ) brushes with varying grafting densities were created via a UV - cleaving process and studied using colloidal - probe atomic force microscopy ( CP - AFM ) nanoindentation . A recently developed indentation methodology that accounts for viscous squeeze - out e ﬀ ects upon approach al - lowed for the accurate determination of the properties of the soft , thin materials . The indentation of di ﬀ erent grafting densities of brushes of identical molecular weights solvated by a common viscous liquid ( i . e . hex - adecane ) allowed direct comparison of rate - dependent ﬂ uid con ﬁ nement within thin surface - grafted polymer layers . This revealed comparable mechanical properties upon quasi - static indentation for the di ﬀ erent grafting - density polymer brushes , showing an elastic modulus of about 0 . 3kPa in the topmost part of all layers . At non - ﬁ nite rates of indentation , the higher grafting densities showed more ﬂ uid con ﬁ nement . The insight gained opens new possibilities for soft thin - layer characterization and provides an accessible technical approach to studying ﬂ uid con ﬁ nement . 1 . Introduction Polymer brushes share some common architectural , mechanical , and friction - reduction properties with natural materials , such as the proteoglycans in articular cartilage and glycoproteins in mucus [ 1 – 5 ] . Measurements on cartilage have shown that reduced density of pro - teoglycans — an e ﬀ ect frequently observed in patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis — can lead to loss of ﬂ uid - load - support - related mechanical properties [ 6 ] . The dependence of ﬂ uid con ﬁ nement on proteoglycan density has inspired us to study the e ﬀ ects of varying grafting density of polymer brushes on their con ﬁ nement of solvent . The ability to con ﬁ ne liquid ( e . g . water or synovial ﬂ uid ) is frequently associated with che - mical or physical interactions between the brush and the ﬂ uid , enabling ﬂ uid - load support and preventing direct contact between brush - coated surfaces [ 7 – 11 ] . This property can also be exploited in tribological applications for extending the boundary - lubrication regime [ 12 – 15 ] . Such behaviour is not limited to aqueous systems , and similar e ﬀ ects can also be observed in oil - compatible polymer brushes .

T experiments on poly ( dodecylmethacrylate ) ( P12MA ) brushes showed the brushes ’ ability to con ﬁ ne the solvent , extend the mixed - lubrication regime and thus delay the onset of boundary friction [ 16 – 18 ] . Espinosa et al . [ 19 ] have performed indentation experiments on P12MA in var - ious solvents using the extended surface forces apparatus ( eSFA ) [ 20 , 21 ] , revealing a viscosity dependence of the con ﬁ nement of ﬂ uid during contact . Besides SFA , atomic force microscopy is also a powerful technique to study thin ﬁ lms , not only in terms of the characterization of topo - graphy , but also with respect to the measurement of local materials properties , including elasticity , hardness and adhesion [ 21 ] . Speci ﬁ - cally , colloidal - probe atomic force microscopy ( CP - AFM ) na - noindentation has become a standard technique for probing soft matter [ 22 – 25 ] . CP - AFM nanoindentation allows for a wider range of sub - strates to be tested than the surface forces apparatus and is also more ﬂ exible in terms of indenter geometries and cantilever sti ﬀ nesses compared to conventional nanoindentation setups [ 26 – 28 ] . In - dependent of the instrument used , the determination of the contact point in the force - separation curves obtained in indentation of soft matter remains a challenging issue [ 26 , 27 , 29 – 32 ] . The problem is magni ﬁ ed at non - ﬁ nite indentation rates and viscous solvents , since upon approach , viscous ﬂ uids can be con ﬁ ned between the probe and sample surface , resulting in an increase in the force experienced by the probe ahead of the actual contact [ 33 ] . Therefore , determining the contact point during rate - dependent indentation can be especially dif - ﬁ cult for polymer brushes in viscous good solvents — a system of par - ticular interest for lubrication [ 34 , 35 ] . Targeting this major issue in soft - matter - indentation measurements , we employ a recently developed method to identify the point of contact between a probe and a polymer - brush layer in a viscous environment upon rate - dependent indentation [ 36 ] . Once the point of contact is unambiguously ascertained for non - ﬁ nite rates , viscous drag and squeeze - out e ﬀ ects can be subtracted and the rate - dependent mechan - ical properties of varying - grafting - density brushes can be determined . Understanding the biphasic properties of soft permeable materials is essential in the development of synthetic replacement materials for cartilage and provides new insights into many related biomedical and engineering applications . 2 . Experimental 2 . 1 . P12MA grafting - density gradient fabrication In order to fabricate poly ( dodecylmethacrylate ) ( P12MA ) brushes of varying grafting density on silicon substrates , a photo - cleavable sur - face - initiated , atom - transfer radical polymerization ( SI - ATRP ) initiator was ﬁ rst synthesized according to our previously described method [ 37 , 38 ] . After deposition of the initiator , P12MA brushes were subse - quently grown from the substrate by SI - ATRP [ 39 ] . Because P12MA brushes were attached to the silicon substrates via a photo - cleavable linker incorporated within the SI - ATRP initiator , P12MA chains could be detached by exposing the sample to UV light with a wavelength of 366 nm , which is too long in wavelength to attack the polymer chains themselves [ 37 ] . Given the simple , ﬁ rst - order kinetics of this reaction , the number of chains removed could be readily controlled by adjusting the irradiation time [ 39 ] . In this way , a step - gradient with three distinct grafting - density domains could be fabricated on a single silicon sub - strate using a shutter to control the UV exposure time on di ﬀ erent parts of the wafer . The UV - induced detachment of P12MA chains from the substrate resulted in a decrease in the grafting density of the remaining P12MA layer , which could be measured as a reduction in dry , collapsed thickness . The dry thickness of the polymer layers was determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry ( M200 - F J . A . Woollam Co . Inc . , Lincoln , USA ) over a spectral range from 370 nm to 995 nm . The spectrum was ﬁ tted using a model that consisted of a pure silicon substrate , a thin Si - oxide layer and a Cauchy layer of refractive index 1 . 45 on top . The VWASE 32 software provided with the instrument was used for the ﬁ tting . An average value of thickness from at least three measurement points was used and the standard deviation reported to one signi ﬁ cant digit . 2 . 2 . Molecular - weight evaluation To determine their number - averaged molecular weight , as well as their polydispersity , the polymer brushes were detached and gathered from the same planar substrate the gradient sample is fabricated from , using the previously reported photocleavage procedure [ 37 ] . The gra - dient domains are prepared using a shutter and exposing a speci ﬁ c area of the photo - cleavable polymer brushes to a de ﬁ ned dosage of UV ir - radiation . With increasing dosage , increasing amounts of polymer chains are cleaved from a domain , resulting in varying grafting - density domains . A number - averaged molecular mass Mn of 371 . 4 kDa ( g / mol ) and a polydispersity index ( PDI ) of 1 . 5 were obtained via a Viscotek Size - Exclusive Chromatography SEC system equipped with a pump , a degasser ( SEC max VE2001 ) , a detector module ( Viscotek 302 TDA ) , a refractive - index ( RI ) detector and two columns ( PLGel Mix - B , PLGel Mix - C ) . Chloroform was used as an eluent with a ﬂ ow rate of 1 . 0 ml / min . Molecular weight of P12MA was measured using a universal ca - libration method in which the product of the logarithm of the intrinsic viscosity η multiplied by the molecular weight M or ln ( η M ) is plotted against the retention volume , with polystyrene standards in the range of Mw 1480 – 4340000 Da . Rudin and Hoegy have shown that such a ca - libration method is extremely e ﬀ ective in determining true molecular weight of a polymer when the concentration of the polymer solution is taken into account [ 40 , 41 ] . 2 . 3 . Grafting - density variation To calculate the surface coverage in units of g / m 2 , the dry polymer thickness t ( m ) was measured via ellipsometry . Assuming a density ρ ( g / m 3 ) , the surface coverage Γ ( g / m 2 ) is : = h ρ t Γ ( ) * ( 1 ) Density ρ was assumed to be 0 . 897 × 10 6 g / m 3 in a dry state , as reported by Zhao et al . [ 42 ] . Knowing the surface coverage , the grafting density Σ ( number of polymer chains per m 2 ) can be obtained as : = t M Σ ( ) Γ * N A n ( 2 ) where M n is the number - averaged molecular mass and N A is Avogadro ' s number . Assuming hexagonal packing of the initiators , the mean se - paration D ( m ) between adjacent polymer chains can be calculated as : = t t D ( ) 2 Σ ( ) * 3 ( 3 ) A summary of the properties of each thickness domain on the polymer - brush gradient is listed in Table 1 . By means of the UV - induced cleavage , we could reduce the number of chains on the surface , thus increasing their anchor spacing and thereby reducing surface coverage and grafting density . We divided the sample into three regions of low Table 1 Dry thickness , surface coverage , grafting density and chain spacing of the three investigated domains .

Nanoindentation procedure The experimental parameters for nanoindentation were determined according to the relative timescales for material deformation and ﬂ uid ﬂ ow . Ateshian et al . applied the Péclet number , the ratio of the ad - vective and the di ﬀ usive transport rates ( see Equation ( 4 ) ) , to quantify the conditions under which ﬂ uid is con ﬁ ned during the indentation of a biphasic material [ 43 , 44 ] . For Péclet numbers above 1 , the advective transport rate is larger than the di ﬀ usive one , meaning that the ﬂ uid is unable to di ﬀ use out from the contact region during indentation . The con ﬁ ned liquid therefore carries part of the applied load , which is frequently referred to as ﬂ uid - load support . In macroscopic tribological studies and ﬁ nite - element simulations on cartilage , it has been shown that such Péclet - number analysis applies to both lateral and normal contact mechanics [ 45 – 47 ] . For a spherical indenter with radius R approaching a biphasic material with elastic modulus E and permeability k at rate v , the Péclet number is de ﬁ ned as . = = ∗ ∗ advective transport rate mass diffusion rate R v E k Pe ( 4 ) The probe radius ( R ) and indentation rate ( v ) of the AFM - na - noindentation experiments were chosen to achieve a similar advective transport rate to those of earlier surface - force - apparatus ( SFA ) and nanoindentation experiments conducted on a P12MA brush grafted from mica surfaces and tested in hexadecane [ 19 ] . Assuming indenta - tion of the identical material , Table 2 shows how three di ﬀ erent ex - perimental setups can provide comparable contact con ﬁ gurations reaching a Péclet number of 1 . Characteristic of Péclet numbers above 1 , earlier experiments showed ﬂ uid - load support when performing SFA measurements using a probe of radius 20 mm at a rate above 2 nm / s . Similar experiments performed with a nanoindenter setup with a sphere of 500 μ m radius at rates above 80 nm / s also showed that a ﬂ uid - load - support contribution was evident . By changing the AFM indentation rates between 200 and 2000 nm / s and using a 40 μ m radius spherical probe , we therefore expected to be able to test the material under both low and high Pe regimes . An MFP - 3D AFM ( Oxford Instruments , Asylum Research , Santa Barbara , CA , USA ) was used to perform the displacement - controlled , colloidal - probe AFM nano - indentation experiments in this work . The experiments were performed on the previously described gradient samples , fully im - mersed in hexadecane , after equilibrating the experimental setup for at least 15 min . AFM probes were produced by gluing silica spheres ( Kromasil , Brewster , NY , USA ) of 40 μ m radius onto tip - less cantilevers ( μ masch , San Jose , CA , USA ) of 0 . 29 N / m spring constant using an in - house micromanipulation setup [ 48 ] . The cantilever normal spring constants were calibrated using the thermal noise method [ 49 ] . The normal sensitivity of each probe was determined by measuring the slope of the de ﬂ ection vs . z - piezo displacement curve obtained on a silicon surface in the relevant solvent . For the indentation experiments , the approach rates were varied as mentioned earlier . After reaching a maximum applied force , a piezo - displacement - controlled equilibration period of 1 s followed , which was su ﬃ cient to reach complete relaxation . Finally , retraction of the probe with the same rate of indentation was performed . A schematic of the indentation protocol is depicted in Fig . 1 below . Each indentation ex - periment was performed at least ten times to guarantee reproducibility . Using the information on the point of contact , one can evaluate the force - indentation curves using classical contact mechanics . For small indentation depths the well - known Sneddon model reduces to a clas - sical Hertzian model , described by Equation ( 5 ) [ 34 , 50 ] Knowing the probe radius ( R ) and assuming a Poisson ' s ratio ( ν ) of 0 . 5 , the elastic modulus ( E ) can be calculated from the force ( F ) experienced by the probe at increasing indentation depths ( δ ) [ 51 ] .

Contact - point determination To accurately determine the point of contact between a probe and a soft material surface in presence of a viscous ﬂ uid an indentation methodology recently presented by Simic et al . for bulk hydrogels was used on the polymer - brush layers [ 36 ] . Fig . 2 illustrates how the in - dentation methodology was adapted to indentation on highly viscous P12MA thin - ﬁ lms . For the slowest indentation rate of 0 . 2 μ m / s only negligible viscous drag and squeeze - out forces were assumed , and the contact point was determined at a probe position , where the normal force upon the approach is no longer within one standard deviation ( ≈ 0 . 075 nN ) from the average determined far away from the surface ( threshold method ) . For all the faster - rate indentations , however , the viscous squeeze - out ahead of contact was substantial . In these cases , the approach and the retraction curves far from the surface were assumed to be symmetrical about zero force and therefore a linear function was ﬁ tted to the average of the approach and retraction curves far from the contact . The ﬁ tted linear function was then subtracted from the entire curve to remove the background slope , see Fig . 3 . The indentation part of the slow indentation curve was then ﬁ tted using F = K ( exp ( n δ ) - 1 ) , which best described the force - distance curve . Due to a small amount of force relaxation observed after reaching the set - point even at the slowest rate , the same shape of a curve F = K ’ ( exp ( n δ ) - 1 ) was ﬁ tted through the relaxed point assuming a linear con - tribution of the con ﬁ nement to the force with increasing indentation depth . The obtained curve was assumed to show a purely elastic re - sponse of the brush that would be observed at an in ﬁ nitely slow in - dentation rate and was therefore used for the depth - alignment of the relaxation points from the force curves obtained at all the faster rates , Fig . 4 . Thus , the relaxation points of the faster rates should coincide with the curve showing purely elastic response , as discussed by Simic et al . [ 36 ] Similarly , Charrault et al . recently reported that for in ﬁ nitely slow indentation rates , only the elastic contribution , and thus an equilibrium elastic modulus , is measured on a force - indentation curve when indenting polymer brushes in the presence of a good solvent — a system characterized by both porous and viscoelastic properties [ 35 ] . Fig . 3 shows already aligned force - indentation and retraction curves for HD - , MD - and LD - P12MA for 0 . 2 , 0 . 5 , 1 and 2 μ m / s indentation rates . From the data shown in Fig . 3 it is apparent that the force o ﬀ set at zero indentation is increasing upon increasing the rate of indentation for all grafting densities . Upon magni ﬁ cation of the force vs . indentation curves for HD - / MD - / LD - P12MA , see Fig . 4 a , b , c respectively , collected at di ﬀ erent indentation rates , a sti ﬀ ening response of the material upon increased indentation rate is evident . For indentation rates of 0 . 5 μ m / s , 1 μ m / s and 2 μ m / s the alignment of the relaxation points to the red line al - lowed us to trace back the point of intersection of the curve at zero - indentation , i . e . the point of contact . In Fig . 5 , the force o ﬀ set at the point of contact due to the viscous squeeze - out e ﬀ ects ahead of contact is shown for the di ﬀ erent in - dentation rates . By knowing the de ﬂ ection and z - sensor position , the actual indentation velocity of the probe can be calculated at the point of contact and are reported as such in the ﬁ gure . The contact - force o ﬀ set increased with indentation rate , as expected due to the presence of viscous dissipation [ 52 , 53 ] . Moreover , it can be seen that the force o ﬀ set increases almost linearly with increasing indentation rate , as predicted by Vinogradova et al . [ 54 ] A deviation from the linear be - haviour could also be caused by a slight deformation of the soft layer during the approach [ 4 , 55 ] . Fig . 3 . Approach and retraction over several micron distance of force in - dentation curves collected on HD / MD / LD - P12MA at di ﬀ erent indentation rates . The approach and retraction curves were assumed to be symmetrical about the zero - force line far away from the surface and used for any background slope subtraction . The red curve represents a scaled ﬁ t to the purely elastic response of the brush layer .

Mechanical characterization of varying grafting - density polymer brushes From AFM nanoindentation experiments performed on the LD - , MD - and HD - P12MA in hexadecane , swollen thicknesses in hexadecane of at least 245 nm , 339 nm and 490 nm , respectively , were estimated ( Fig . 4 ) . Assuming that under the highest applied load the swollen brush was compressed all the way down to its dry thickness , the lower limit of the Fig . 4 . Average force indentation curves for a ) HD - P12MA b ) MD - P12MA c ) LD - P12MA indented at di ﬀ erent indentation rates . In red the ﬁ tted “ zero - rate ” in - dentation curve is indicated . ( For interpretation of the references to colour in this ﬁ gure legend , the reader is referred to the Web version of this article . ) C . H . Mathis , et al . Polymer 169 ( 2019 ) 115 – 123 119 swollen thickness could be determined by adding the total indentation depth to the dry thickness . Comparing these values to the dry thickness evaluated via ellipsometry , this implies a minimum swelling ratio of about 12 , 3 and 3 for LD - , MD - and HD - P12MA , respectively . Theore - tical calculations ( see Supplementary Material ) support the minimum swelling ratios , and from the critical grafting - density as well as the crowding threshold , a densely packed brush - structure is expected for HD - P12MA and MD - P12MA , while for LD - P12MA individual chains have ample space , adapting energetically more favourable mushroom - conformations [ 56 , 57 ] . In another work , P12MA of similarly low grafting density ( 0 . 065 nm − 2 ) was grafted from a mica surface and showed a swelling ratio of 12 in hexadecane [ 19 ] , in line with nSCF theory of increased swelling with decreasing grafting density [ 58 ] . Despite the large indentation depth with respect to the swollen thickness and the presumably non - homogeneous ( gradient ) structure in a swollen state , the force - indentation curves were ﬁ tted using Hertzian contact mechanics , even beyond the usual limit of 10 % of strain . This involved ﬁ tting smaller regions of force - indentation curves of 48 nm in width using the Hertzian model with a step of 12 nm , in order to obtain a depth - dependent contact modulus . Fig . 6a shows the progression of the Hertzian modulus with indentation depth for HD - , MD - and LD - P12MA at the indentation rate of 0 . 2 μ m / s , where an expected modulus increase with indentation depth can be observed for the previously mentioned reasons . The contact modulus during the ﬁ rst 10 – 20 % of indentation showed very low values of about 0 . 3 kPa for all three grafting densities . Although the modulus values lie below previously published values reported for comparable polymer brushes [ 19 ] , the values are reliable , due to the very accurately determined contact point . The analysis of the initial 10 % of the indentation curve also avoids possible substrate ef - fects during compression . The very low , but somewhat similar , value of the elastic modulus measured at the surface of all three samples most probably indicates that all three samples have some loose , dangling chains stretching out in the solvent , due to dispersity e ﬀ ects . However , given the relatively large error bars compared to the value at that point , it is di ﬃ cult to claim that the values are exactly the same for all three samples . Upon further indentation , the moduli increase signi ﬁ cantly for all three grafting densities . Although the evolution of the contact moduli with indentation seems to be similar for all samples , especially when normalized to the total layer thickness ( Fig . 6b ) , the measured moduli alone do not necessarily correspond to the same conformation of polymer chains . As described by Pasche et al . , the polymer concentra - tion during the indentation increases , as does the osmotic pressure . However , the elastic restoring force of a dense polymer brush can ac - tually decrease during this process [ 59 ] . This would hold for the HD and MD regions , where the polymer chains were very likely in a stretched brush conformation . For the LD region and the assumed mushroom conformation , on the other hand , the elastic and the osmotic contributions could both be increasing with increasing indentation . This , in turn , could result in comparable evolution of the contact moduli for all three grafting densities , but it would be erroneous to assume a similar conformation for all three samples based on the evo - lution of the moduli alone . Nevertheless , when considering the con - ﬁ nement e ﬀ ects of the liquid permeating through variously dense brushes with di ﬀ erent conformations , the di ﬀ erences between the samples become far more apparent . Inspecting Fig . 4 , it is clear that indentations taking place at in - creasing rates reach higher forces at a speci ﬁ c indentation depth — an e ﬀ ect attributed to both ﬂ uid - con ﬁ nement as well as viscoelastic re - sponse of solvated polymer brushes . This behaviour is in line with the response observed upon rate - dependent indentation on macroscopic hydrogel samples using the same indentation methodology [ 36 ] . While for HD - P12MA the response upon indentation and corresponding re - laxation during the dwell phase is strong , its magnitude reduces upon decreasing grafting density in the MD - and LD - P12MA brushes . In order to quantify and compare the forces measured for the Fig . 5 . Force o ﬀ set at di ﬀ erent indentation rates for the three di ﬀ erent grafting densities investigated . Fig . 6 . a ) Progression of the Hertzian modulus with indentation depth for HD - , MD - and LD - P12MA at a slow indentation rate of 0 . 2 μ m / s and b ) a comparison between HD - , MD - and LD - P12MA for both 0 . 2 μ m / s for indentation depths normalized with respect to the respective swollen layer thickness . C . H . Mathis , et al . Polymer 169 ( 2019 ) 115 – 123 120 di ﬀ erent indentation rates , the sti ﬀ ening with respect to the force de - termined for the zero - rate indentation ( 0 μ m / s ) was calculated along the depth of indentation δ according to equation ( 6 ) : = − Stiffening δ F F F ( ) x 0 0 ( 6 ) where F x is the force measured at velocity x and depth δ , and F 0 is the force of the purely elastic response at the same indentation δ . Fig . 7 shows force sti ﬀ ening upon indentation at various rates for the three grafting densities . At the slowest rate of indentation , very - little - to - no sti ﬀ ening is observed for any of the grafting densities . Ap - parently , at this rate the ﬂ uid can be expelled from the region under - going compression without any con ﬁ nement e ﬀ ects occurring . The sti ﬀ ening at the slowest rate for the MD brush , however , shows a peak at about 50 nm , which is unexpected , assuming a uniform sti ﬀ ening throughout the layer thickness at this rate . While the function used for ﬁ tting describes the HD and LD very well , it underestimates the forces for the MD at indentation depths of 50 nm . Consequently , the sti ﬀ ening Fig . 7 . Sti ﬀ ening with respect to indentation depth and thickness - normalized indentation depth of a ) HD - P12MA , b ) MD - P12MA and c ) LD - P12MA brushes . C . H . Mathis , et al . Polymer 169 ( 2019 ) 115 – 123 121 is slightly overestimated for the MD brush in this region . In the case of an ideal ﬁ t , the sti ﬀ ening at the slowest indentation should be low and constant as seen for the HD and LD brushes . Increasing the rate of in - dentation clearly shows increased values of sti ﬀ ening for all the P12MA layers , although the sti ﬀ ening is more pronounced for increasing grafting densities . For HD - P12MA ( Fig . 7a ) , the sti ﬀ ening gradually decreases with increasing depth of indentation — indicative of possible con ﬁ nement e ﬀ ects causing apparent sti ﬀ ening throughout the layer thickness . The decay could be originating from the compression of the brush , as liquid is expelled from within , leading to a gradual decrease of the sti ﬀ ening e ﬀ ect as less ﬂ uid is available . A sole contribution by osmotic pressure has recently been challenged in the work of Abbott et al . [ 58 ] , i . e . both mechanical ﬂ uid con ﬁ nement and related por - oelastic phenomena could be jointly contributing to the observed me - chanical behaviour . For decreased grafting densities , MD - P12MA and LD - P12MA , the sti ﬀ ening is more pronounced within the top of the layer and sharply declines thereafter . The sharp decline , particularly visible for LD - P12MA , could be attributed to easier migration of the ﬂ uid through the lower - density polymer brush . Despite the large error bars , clear trends can be observed for the di ﬀ erent grafting densities , nevertheless future work will aim at further improving the indentation method . 3 . 3 . Con ﬁ nement - dependent force relaxation After reaching a force set - point at a given indentation rate , the piezo movement was stopped ( dwell phase ) and force relaxation followed , due to the vanishing of the poro - and viscoelastic e ﬀ ects . A dwell phase of 1 s was su ﬃ cient to achieve complete force relaxation . Such a de - crease in force can be seen in the magni ﬁ ed force - distance plots in Fig . 4 . However , plotting the force relaxation as a function of time in Fig . 8 enables much clearer comparison between the di ﬀ erent grafting densities . For HD - P12MA during the dwell phase , a strong force re - laxation can be observed upon increasing the rate of indentation , Fig . 8a . At 0 . 2 μ m / s only minor relaxation is observed , indicative that the layer was drained of ﬂ uid already upon indentation . At increasing indentation rates however , the force relaxation over time clearly in - dicates an initial con ﬁ nement e ﬀ ect . Such behaviour is characteristic of a poro - or viscoelastic material response , as reported for polymers [ 34 ] as well as hydrogels [ 25 , 60 ] . For decreasing grafting density , the force relaxation is less pronounced , presumably since the sparser structures are drained to a larger extent at comparable pressures . While this ob - servation also supports the theory of ﬂ uid con ﬁ nement through me - chanical retention of the ﬂ uid within the porous brush structure , since all layers are considerably compressed , future experiments should aim at indentations of either thicker layers or at a lesser degree of com - pression . 4 . Conclusions In this study , polymer brushes of equal molecular weight , yet dif - fering in grafting density , were compared in terms of structural and mechanical properties . The measured grafting densities in combination with the observed compression upon indentation revealed a densely packed brush - like layer for MD - and HD - P12MA , while despite a high swelling ratio , the sparsely spaced chains for LD - P12MA arrange in a more mushroom - like conformation . Theoretical calculations con ﬁ rm that the observations are in line with the scaling [ 56 ] and crowding theories [ 57 ] . Upon accurate determination of the point of contact , comparison of the modulus development upon indentation yielded a comparable elastic modulus for the di ﬀ erently dense P12MA brushes of about 0 . 3 kPa . This is the ﬁ rst report of grafting - density - independent modulus determination using a conventional CP - AFM setup , extending the in - sight gained from earlier complex eSFA experiments [ 19 ] . Apparently , the methodology employed allows for accurate determination of the mechanical properties of ultra - thin ultra - low - moduli materials — a capability that is of great potential utility in several disciplines such as tissue engineering and bio - inspired coatings . Calculation of a theoretical zero - rate indentation allowed an in - depth study of the ﬂ uid - con ﬁ nement and viscoelasticity - related stif - fening . The sti ﬀ ening behaviour analysis revealed a clear dependence Fig . 8 .

Polymer 169 ( 2019 ) 115 – 123 122 on the grafting density indicative of con ﬁ nement - and viscoelasticity - related e ﬀ ects supporting the load applied upon increased indentation rate . Following the indentation , relaxation of the probe showed a clear indication of a ﬂ uid out ﬂ ow from within the contact area , which was most pronounced for HD - P12MA . The indentation analysis of varying - grafting - density P12MA yielded new insights into the challenges of contact - point determination for soft , thin , viscoelastic polymers in the presence of a good viscous solvent . The methodology presented highlights the force o ﬀ set upon non - zero rates of indentation and provides a means to account for it . Analysis of the mechanical properties revealed the actual low modulus , previously overestimated by orders of magnitude due to viscous e ﬀ ects upon contact between the colloidal probe and polymer brush as well as po - tential substrate e ﬀ ects . Ultimately the insight gained could help de - velop new soft materials , such as contact lenses or coatings for medical devices , whose properties are dependent on optimal moduli , ﬂ uid - con ﬁ nement and viscoelastic e ﬀ ects .
