Phospho - inositide 3 - kinases ( PI3Ks ) regulate a diverse array of dynamic membrane events . However , it is not well - understood which PI3K isoforms are involved in specific mechanisms of pinocytosis . We performed knockdown studies of endogenous PI3K isoforms and clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) mediated by small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) . The results demonstrated that the class II PI3K PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β , but not the class I or III PI3K , were required for pinocytosis , based on an evalu - ation of fluorescein - 5 - isothiocyanate ( FITC ) – dextran uptake in endothelial cells . Pinocytosis was partially dependent on both clathrin and dynamin , and both PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β were required for clathrin - mediated—but not clathrin - non - mediated—FITC - dextran uptake at the step leading up to its delivery to early endosomes . Both PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β were co - localized with clathrin - coated pits and vesicles . However , PI3K - C2β , but not PI3K - C2α , was highly co - localized with actin filament - associated clathrin - coated structures and required for actin filament formation at the clathrin - coated structures . These results indicate that PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β play differential , indispensable roles in clathrin - mediated pinocytosis . Keywords Class II PI3K · PI3K - C2α · PI3K - C2β · Pinocytosis · Clathrin · Endothelial cell Introduction Pinocytosis or fluid - phase endocytosis is an endocytic pro - cess in which extracellular fluid is engulfed into endocytic vesicles [ 1 ] . The known processes for endocytic vesicle formation are clathrin - dependent , caveolin - dependent and combined clathrin - / caveolin - independent processes [ 2 , 3 ] , among which clathrin - dependent endocytosis has been best characterized to date . Clathrin - dependent endocyto - sis begins with the formation of invaginations or pits at the plasma membrane , followed by the formation of endocytic vesicles through the pinching - off of the invagination neck by dynamin . In endocytic processes , a complex protein machin - ery works along with clathrins . The actin cytoskeletons are organized at clathrin - coated pits ( actin patches ) and partici - pate in the growth of clathrin - coated pits . Pinocytosis takes place in almost all types of cells , but its role in blood capil - lary endothelial cells has been recognized as an important portal of trans - endothelial transport of proteins , lipids and lipoproteins , drugs and cell - secreted exosomes and micro - particles [ 4 ] . Endocytic processes are regulated by polyphospho - inositides ( PPIs ) [ 5 ] , small G proteins , including Rab [ 6 ] , and other proteins [ 7 ] . PPIs are produced by phosphorylation of the inositol ring through the actions of phosphoinositide kinases . Among these , phosphoinositide 3 - kinases ( PI3K ) , which catalyze the phosphorylation of the D3 position within the inositol ring , play particularly important roles in membrane trafficking , including endocytosis . There are three classes of PI3K . Class I PI3Ks are activated mainly by receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein - coupled receptors to exert an effect on cell proliferation , migration and control of cell metabolism by generating PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s1257 6 - 018 - 0644 - 2 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users . * Yoh Takuwa ytakuwa @ med . kanazawa - u . ac . jp 1 Department of Physiology , Kanazawa University School of Medicine , Kanazawa , Ishikawa 920 - 8640 , Japan 2 Department of Health Science , Ishikawa Prefectural University , Kahoku , Ishikawa 929 - 1210 , Japan 264 The Journal of Physiological Sciences ( 2019 ) 69 : 263 – 280 1 3 [ 8 – 10 ] . Class III PI3K , Vps34 , stimulates the autophagic pathway by generating PI ( 3 ) P [ 11 , 12 ] . In contrast to class I and class III PI3K , the roles of class II PI3K , comprising PI3K - C2α , - C2β and - C2γ , remain poorly understood . How - ever , recent studies , including those from our research group , have shown that PI3K - C2α is required for the endocytosis of certain membrane proteins , such as vascular endothe - lial growth factor receptor and sphingosine - 1 - phosphate receptor , while PI3K - C2β is involved in the regulation of autophagy [ 13 – 17 ] . The molecular and cellular mechanisms of pinocytosis , including clathrin dependence or independ - ence and the requirement of PI3K , are not fully understood . Of the three members of class II PI3K , PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β , are highly homologous and widely expressed , whereas PI3K - C2γ shows less homology to PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β and restricted expression in certain organs , including the liver and prostate [ 18 , 19 ] . Therefore , in the study reported here we addressed whether and how class II PI3K - C2α and - C2β are involved in pinocytosis in human vascular endothelial cells . We found that PI3K - C2α and - C2β were both required for clathrin - dependent pinocytosis but not for clathrin - independent pinocytosis . Interestingly , super - resolution microscopy revealed that both PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β were co - localized to clathrin - coated pits and vesicles , but that only PI3K - C2β was highly co - localized to actin filament ( F - actin ) - associated clathrin - coated pits and vesicles . These observations suggest that PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β are involved in clathrin - mediated pinocytosis through different mechanisms . Materials and methods Cell culture , reagents and transfection Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) ( cata - log no . C2517A ; Lonza , Basel , Switzerland ) were plated on type - I collagen ( Nitta Gelatin , Osaka , Japan ) - coated dishes and cultured in endothelial growth medium ( EGM - 2 ) sup - plemented with 2 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and growth factor - enriched cocktails ( catalog no .

Results Class II PI3K‑C2α and PI3K‑C2β are necessary for pinocytosis We studied the roles of PI3K - C2α and - C2β in pinocytic activity at steady - state in HUVECs , a well - characterized human primary vascular endothelial cell model . Pinocytic activity was evaluated by determining the time - dependent uptake of a fluid - phase marker , FITC - dextran , into cells .

Scale bar : 20 μm . Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean ( SEM ) in c and as the median and interquartile range ( IQR ) in b , e and f . Asterisks indicate statistical significance between the indi - cated groups : * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 ◂ 268 The Journal of Physiological Sciences ( 2019 ) 69 : 263 – 280 1 3 FITC - dextran uptake was observed to increase in a time - dependent manner ( Fig . 1a , b ) . To study the roles of PI3K isoforms in pinocytosis , we investigated the effects of siRNA - mediated knockdown of individual PI3K isoforms on FITC - dextran uptake . The siRNAs specific to class II PI3K - C2α and - C2β , class I p110α , and class III Vps34 effectively and specifically inhibited the protein expres - sion of the respective PI3K isoform ( Fig . 1c ) . Knockdown of PI3K - C2α or PI3K - C2β partially but significantly ( 53 and 70 % , respectively ) decreased FITC - dextran uptake , 269 The Journal of Physiological Sciences ( 2019 ) 69 : 263 – 280 1 3 compared with scrambled siRNA transfection ( Fig . 1d , e ) . In contrast , knockdown of either p110α or Vps34 did not inhibit FITC - dextran uptake . We also studied the effects of pharmacological PI3K inhibitors on pinocytic activity . The treatment of cells with a higher dose ( 1 µM ) of the pan - PI3K inhibitor WMN caused a reduction in FITC - dextran uptake compared with cells treated with vehicle . However , a lower dose ( 30 nM ) of WMN , the class I PI3K inhibitor GDC - 0941 or the Vps34 - specific inhibitor 3 - MA failed to inhibit FITC - dextran uptake ( Fig . 1f ) . These data suggest that class II PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β , but not class I p110α or class III Vps34 , are involved in fluid - phase pinocytosis in HUVECs . Pinocytosis in HUVECs is partially dependent on clathrin and dynamin We examined whether pinocytosis at steady - state in HUVECs required clathrin and dynamin or not . The clath - rin inhibitor , Pitstop - 2 , inhibited FITC - dextran uptake by approximately 69 % ( Fig . 2a ) . Similarly , siRNA - mediated knockdown of the CHC inhibited FITC - dextran uptake by approximately 55 % ( Fig . 2b ) . Furthermore , the expression of the dominant negative mutant ( K44A ) of dynamin - 2 ( dn - Dyn2 ) inhibited the FITC - dextran uptake by approxi - mately 53 % ( Fig . 2c ) . These observations indicate that pinocytosis in HUVECs is at least partially mediated by clathrin - and dynamin - dependent processes . Interestingly , the extent of inhibition by the inhibitor , of the knock - down and of the mutant protein were roughly similar to those induced by knockdown of PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β ( Fig . 1e ) . Partially overlapping subcellular localization of PI3K‑C2α and PI3K‑C2β The subcellular localization of PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β in HUVECs that expressed GFP - C2α and mCherry - C2β was studied using super - resolution microscopy . GFP - C2α was distributed as fine puncta widely throughout the cells , whereas mCherry - C2β was enriched mainly in the peri - nuclear region as coarse puncta , in the peripheral regions surrounding podosomes as coarse and fine puncta and in the plasma membrane ( Fig . 3a ) . A substantial portion of mCherry - C2β in the cell periphery was closely associ - ated with F - actin structures ( membrane ruffles and small F - actin assembly [ actin patches ] ) ( Fig . 3b , right ) . In contrast , GFP - C2α was barely associated with the F - actin structures ( Fig . 3b , left ) . The punctate fluorescence of GFP - C2α over - lapped strikingly with clathrin - coated pits and vesicles . A part of the GFP - C2α fluorescence was co - localized with EEA1 - positive ( EEA1 + ) early endosomes ( EE ) , and to much lesser extents with Rab7 + late endosomes ( LE ) , LAMP1 + lysosomes ( LY ) , and LC3B + autophagosomes ( AP ) ( Fig . 3c ) . Our research group and others have previously demonstrated the co - localization of PI3K - C2α with clathrin - coated struc - tures and EE , using anti - PI3K - C2α immunostaining [ 13 , 21 – 23 ] . In contrast , PI3K - C2β signals were less frequently co - localized with clathrin - coated pits and vesicles compared with GFP - C2α and slightly co - localized with EE , LE and LY . However , perinuclear PI3K - C2β was highly co - localized with LC3B + - AP ( Fig . 3d ) . Thus , GFP - C2α and mCherry - C2β showed significantly different subcellular localization , suggesting that PI3K - C2α and - C2β may differentially con - trol pinocytic processes . We also determined the subcellular localization of endogenous PI3K - C2β using anti - PI3K - C2β immunostaining . Endogenous PI3K - C2β was partially co - localized with F - actin structures , clathrin - coated structures and LC3B + AP and less frequently with EEA1 + EE ( Fig . 4 ) , which is similar to the results obtained with mCherry - C2β expression ( Fig . 3d ) . PI3K‑C2α and ‑C2β are required for clathrin‑mediated pinocytosis To gain further insight into the regulation of pinocytosis by PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β , we examined the effects of double knockdown of PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β mRNAs on pinocy - tosis . The double knockdown of PI3K - C2α and - C2β gave similar extents of suppression of PI3K - C2α and - C2β protein expression and the FITC - dextran uptake as with the single knockdown of either PI3K - C2α or PI3K - C2β ( Fig . 5a ) .

Knockdown of CHC inhibited FITC - dextran uptake . Double knockdown of CHC and either of PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β did not result in further inhibition of FITC - dextran uptake compared with inhibition by CHC single knockdown ( Fig . 5b ) . These findings suggest that both PI3K - C2α and - C2β are required for clathrin - dependent , but not clathrin - independent , pinocytosis . Since single knock - down of either PI3K - C2α or - C2β resulted in complete inhi - bition of the clathrin - mediated pinocytosis , we concluded that the two isoforms play non - redundant , distinct roles in clathrin - mediated pinocytosis . Live cell super - resolution imaging of the cells trans - fected with either GFP - C2α or GFP - C2β and mRFP - CLC showed that GFP - C2α formed dynamic puncta that were mostly co - localized with mRFP - CLC ( Fig . 5c and Elec - tronic Supplementary Material [ ESM ] movie 1 with movie legends ( Supplementary material 1 ) ) . GFP - C2β was also co - localized with mRFP - CLC puncta , but the co - localization was less abundant than in the case of PI3K - C2α ( Fig . 5d and ESM movie 2 with movie legends ) . The serial , magni - fied images showed that PI3K - C2α and - C2β were recruited to mRFP - CLC puncta and then the clathrin was disassem - bled , followed by the dissociation of GFP - C2α and GFP - C2β ( Fig . 5c , d , lower panels , and e ) . The fluid - phase marker Alexa 647 - dextran was found in vesicles that were dou - ble - positive for mRFP - CLC and either GFP - C2α or - C2β ( Fig . 5f ) , thereby providing morphological evidence that the dextran was pinocytosed , at least in part , into PI3K - C2α and - C2β - associated clathrin - coated vesicles . Since clathrin - coated pinocytic vesicles are transported to EE , we examined the effects of knockdown of PI3K - C2α and - C2β on FITC - dextran accumulation in EE in the cells expressing the EE marker mRFP - Rab5 .

We determined the time course of degrada - tion of internalized FITC - dextran using pulse - chase exper - iments . After 60 min of FITC - dextran uptake , the cells were washed and monitored for up to 8 h for the FITC - dextran remaining in the cells . The intensity of FITC - dex - tran within either PI3K - C2α - or PI3K - C2β - depleted cells gradually decreased with a similar time course , compared with scrambled siRNA - transfected cells ( Fig . 5h ) , suggest - ing that degradation of the uptaked FITC - dextran was not altered by knockdown of PI3K - C2α or - C2β . These find - ings collectively suggest that both PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β are involved in the early step ( s ) of the clathrin - mediated pinocytic pathway , namely the process up to FITC - dextran delivery to the Rab5 + - EE . PI3K‑C2β is required for the formation of pinocytic vesicle‑associated actin filaments Based on our results showing the co - localization of class II PI3Ks , particularly PI3K - C2β , with F - actin ( Fig . 3 ) and on previous reports noting the requirement of actin polym - erization at clathrin - coated pits and vesicles for pit matura - tion and vesicle formation [ 24 – 26 ] , we studied the roles of PI3K - C2α and - C2β in F - actin formation at clathrin - coated pits , using super - resolution microscopy . The cells that had been transfected with mRFP - CLC and the GFP - tagged F - actin - binding peptide mEmerald - Lifeact were subjected to uptake of Alexa 647 - dextran . As in the case of FITC - dextran uptake , knockdown of PI3K - C2α or - C2β sub - stantially inhibited Alexa 647 - dextran uptake ( Fig . 6a – d ) . Many of the dextran - containing pinocytic vesicles were associated with F - actin ( actin patches ) ( Fig . 6a ) . A substan - tial portion of clathrin - coated pits and vesicles was associ - ated with actin patches . Knockdown of PI3K - C2β greatly reduced the formation of clathrin - associated actin patches ( Fig . 6a – c , e ) . Moreover , knockdown of PI3K - C2β , but not of PI3K - C2α , reduced the co - localization of actin patches and dextran ( Fig . 6a – c , f ) . Consistent with this , there were relatively fewer dextran - positive pinocytic vesicles in PI3K - C2β - depleted cells that were associated with F - actin ( white arrowheads in Fig . 6a , c ) . Instead , there were relatively more pinocytic vesicles in PI3K - C2β - depleted cells that were not associated with F - actin ( yellow arrows ) . These observations suggest that PI3K - C2β facilitated actin patch formation at clathrin - coated structures to promote clathrin - mediated pinocytosis . Overexpression of PI3K‑C2β but not PI3K‑C2α enhances the uptake of dextran We studied whether overexpression of mCherry - PI3K - C2α and - C2β affected pinocytosis . Intersectin - 1 ( ITSN1 ) , which was originally found to be localized in clathrin - coated pits [ 27 ] , has been very recently identified as a multifunctional scaffold protein that is required for actin patch formation [ 28 ] . The ITSN1 has also been shown previously to bind PI3K - C2β [ 29 ] . Therefore , we compared the effects of PI3K - C2α and - C2β overexpression with and without expression of GFP - tagged ITSN1 ( GFP - ITSN1 ) . mCherry - C2β expres - sion increased dextran uptake only when GFP - ITSN1 was co - expressed ( Fig . 7a , b ) . Interestingly , the expression of GFP - ITSN1 recruited mCherry - C2β from the cytoplasmic pool to GFP - ITSN1 - localized structures ( Fig . 7a ) . In con - trast , PI3K - C2α overexpression did not increase dextran uptake or induce PI3K - C2α recruitment to dot - like structures Fig . 5 PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β are required for clathrin - mediated pinocytosis . a Effects of double knockdown of PI3K - C2α and - C2β on FITC - dextran uptake .

These observations suggest that mCherry - C2β overexpression stimulated pinocytosis through the mechanisms involving GFP - ITSN1 - mediated recruitment of mCherry - C2β . Endogenous ITSN1 is required for the formation of actin patches and recruitment of PI3K‑C2β to the clathrin‑coated structures We determined the impact of ITSN1 knockdown on F - actin structures and translocation of endogenous PI3K - C2β . In control cells , ITSN1 showed a punctate distribution pattern with anti - ITSN1 staining , and it was partially co - localized with actin patches and clathrin - coated structures ( Fig . 8a ) . ITSN1 knockdown effectively reduced ITSN1 expression compared with control cells and it severely impaired the formation of F - actin structures , including actin patches and stress fibers ( Fig . 8a , left ) . In contrast , ITSN1 knock - down did not affect the number of clathrin - coated structures ( Fig . 8a , right ) . Interestingly , ITSN1 knockdown dramati - cally reduced the localization of PI3K - C2β at actin patches ( Fig . 8b , left ) and at clathrin - coated structures ( Fig . 8b right ) . These data are consistent with the notion that endog - enous ITSN1 is required for the formation of clathrin - associated actin patches and PI3K - C2β localization at actin filament - associated clathrin - coated structures . Discussion Phosphoinositide 3 - kinases are recognized as crucial regula - tors for various membrane trafficking events , which include phagocytosis , macropinocytosis and autophagy , through PI3K class - specific multiple mechanisms [ 11 , 30 – 36 ] . In the present study we demonstrated that , among the three different PI3K classes , pinocytosis or fluid - phase endocy - tosis requires class II PI3K PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β , but not class I p110α or class III Vps34 . Mechanistically , both of these two class II PI3K isoforms are required for clathrin - mediated , but not clathrin - non - mediated , pinocytosis , very likely through differential mechanisms . Previous studies , including those of our group [ 13 , 14 , 21 – 23 ] , have shown that PI3K - C2α is closely associated with clathrin - coated pits and vesicles through its direct interaction via its N - terminal clathrin - binding domain and that knockdown of PI3K - C2α inhibits internalization of cell surface molecules . In contrast , little is understood to date on the role of PI3K - C2β in the regulation of endo - cytosis . In our study , pinocytosis in HUVECs consisted of both clathrin - mediated and - non - mediated processes , based on the dextran uptake assays . Our data of the double knockdown experiments showed that both PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β participated in clathrin - mediated , but not - non - mediated , pinocytosis . Interestingly , because knockdown of either one of PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β induced inhibi - tion of pinocytosis to a similar extent as double knock - down of PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β , the results suggest that PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β play distinct , non - redundant roles in clathrin - mediated pinocytosis . A previous study [ 37 ] showed that mitotic spindle assembly required PI3K - C2α protein but not its kinase activity , suggesting a scaffold role of PI3K - C2α in mitotic spindle assembly . PI3K - C2α has been observed to be clearly less sensitive to the pan - PI3K inhibitors WMN and LY294002 , and higher concentrations of both inhibitors were required for effective inhibition of PI3K - C2α com - pared with the other PI3K members [ 38 , 39 ] . PI3K - C2β was more sensitive than PI3K - C2α to the PI3K inhibi - tors , but it was a little less sensitive to the inhibitors than class I and III PI3Ks . In the present study , only the higher concentration of WMN , but not its lower concentration , inhibited pinocytosis . Based on previous reports [ 38 , 39 ] , the lower concentration of WMN was expected to effec - tively inhibit class I and III PI3K but not PI3K - C2α . It is difficult to conclude whether PI3K - C2β was effectively inhibited or not by the lower dose of WMN . Therefore , these results could imply that the kinase activity of at least either one of PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β is required for pinocytosis . In the case when one of PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β acts via a kinase - independent mechanism , it could include a scaffold role [ 37 , 40 ] . Further investigations are necessary to explore the possibility that PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β regulate pinocytosis via kinase - independent mechanisms .

First , PI3K - C2β and PI3K - C2α were co - localized with dextran - containing , clathrin - coated endocytic vesicles ( Fig . 5f ) . PI3K - C2β and PI3K - C2α exhibited similar behaviors in the assembly and disas - sembly processes with clathrin - coated pits and / or vesicles ( Fig . 5c – e ) . Second , the detailed microscopic analyses revealed differences in their localization at clathrin - coated pits and / or vesicles : PI3K - C2β showed stronger co - local - ization with F - actin than did PI3K - C2α ( Fig . 3 ) and was required for the actin organization at dextran - containing , clathrin - coated structures ( Fig . 6c , e , f ) . Third , PI3K - C2β overexpression resulted in different effects on dextran uptake and the interaction with ITSN1 compared with PI3K - C2α : the overexpression of PI3K - C2β , but not of PI3K - C2α , stimulated pinocytosis with changes in PI3K - C2β distribution in the presence of overexpressed ITSN1 . The results of the present study and of previous studies suggest that PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β are recruited to clath - rin - coated pits and vesicles through different mechanisms . It is recognized that PI3K - C2α is localized to clathrin - coated structures through its N - terminal clathrin - binding domain and C - terminal PX - C2 module [ 22 , 41 ] . The C - terminal PX - C2 module contributes to PI3K - C2α recruitment to the clathrin - coated structures through its binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on the membrane . The binding of PI3K - C2α to the clathrin - coated membrane relieves the intramolecular autoinhibi - tion and enhances its enzymatic activity , resulting in PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 accumulation [ 41 ] . Accumulation of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 enables recruitment of the PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - binding endocytic effector pro - teins , including SNX9 , at the clathrin - coated pits to pro - mote endocytosis . In contrast , PI3K - C2β , which lacks the typical clathrin - binding domain , likely requires a different mechanism for its recruitment to clathrin - coated structures . A complex protein machinery which acts in the endocytic site includes ITSN1 , a multifunctional scaffold protein [ 28 ] . Importantly , ITSN1 was previously identified as a binding partner of PI3K - C2β through the interaction between its SH3 domain and proline - rich region of PI3K - C2β [ 29 ] . Consistent with this observation , our study showed that ITSN1 overexpression changed the subcellular distribution of PI3K - C2β , resulting in PI3K - C2β distribution as many dots . Vice versa , knockdown of ITSN1 resulted in decreased translocation of PI3K - C2β into clathrin - coated structures . In contrast , PI3K - C2α does not possess such a proline - rich region . Therefore , ITSN1 likely does not serve as a binding partner for PI3K - C2α . In fact , in the present study ITSN1 overexpression did not affect the subcellular distribution of PI3K - C2α . A recent study [ 28 ] showed that in the endocytic site , ITSN1 also recruits the F - BAR domain - containing pro - tein FCHSD2 , which stimulates actin polymerization via the activation of WASP family proteins , resulting in the for - mation of actin patches around the clathrin - coated pits . The actin cytoskeleton is involved in multiple steps of clathrin - coated vesicle formation , i . e . nucleation for plasma mem - brane invagination , progression to form mature clathrin - coated pits and scission to expel vesicles into the cytoplasm , thus facilitating endocytosis [ 42 – 44 ] . The recruitment of the F - BAR protein FCHSD2 to the clathrin - coated pits and vesicles is a key event in clathrin - coated vesicle formation and relies on the interaction between FCHSD2 and ITSN1 and the binding of FCHSD2 to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 on the membrane . Therefore , PI3K - C2β may contribute to actin polymeriza - tion in the endocytic site through generating PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and recruiting FCHSD2 . PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β are both large multi - domain proteins and undergo complex interac - tions with multiple proteins in the clathrin - coated pits and vesicles . Therefore , although both PI3K mainly generate the same lipid product PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , the functional roles that PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β play in clathrin - coated vesicle formation are different . In conclusion , the results of our study indicate that bothPI3K - C2β and PI3K - C2α are required for fluid - phase endocytosis . Our data collectively suggest that both PI3K - C2α and PI3K - C2β participate in the clathrin - coated vesicle formation but through different mechanisms . PI3K - C2β pro - motes clathrin - coated vesicle formation very likely through stimulating F - actin formation in the endocytic site . Thus , our study emphasizes the involvement of two isoforms of class II PI3K in clathrin - mediated endocytosis .
