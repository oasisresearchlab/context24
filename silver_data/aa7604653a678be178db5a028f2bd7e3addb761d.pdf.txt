Copyright 2003 Psychonomic Society , Inc . 634 Behavior Research Methods , Instruments , & Computers 2003 , 35 ( 4 ) , 634 - 639 We have developed 144 simple problems for use in our research on the experience of insight in problem solving . These problems were patterned after items in the Remote Associates Test ( RAT ) developed by Mednick ( 1962 ) . Our goal in the present article is to make these problems available to other researchers along with normative in - formation regarding the relative difficulty of each prob - lem . These normative data can be used in the selection of problems according to difficulty or mean time necessary for reaching a solution . Mednick ( 1962 ) developed the RAT as a means of measuring creative thought without requiring knowledge specific to any field . He constructed two college - level versions of the test , each consisting of 30 items ( Med - nick , 1968 ; Mednick & Mednick , 1967 ) . Each item con - sists of three words that can be associated with a solution word in a number of ways ; thus , for example , the three words SAME / TENNIS / HEAD are associated with the solution MATCH by means of synonymy ( same = match ) , forma - tion of a compound word ( matchhead ) , and semantic as - sociation ( tennis match ) . Reaching a solution requires “creative thought , ” because the first , most related , infor - mation retrieved in solution attempts is often not correct , and solvers must think of more distantly related infor - mation in order to connect the three words . Problem solvers’ success on items from the original RAT reliably correlates with their success on classic insight problems ( Dallob & Dominowski , 1993 ; Schooler & Melcher , 1995 ) . For the most part , the RAT and RAT - like problems have been used in the study of problem solving and creative thinking ( e . g . , Ansburg , 2000 ; Beeman & Bowden , 2000 ; Bowden & Beeman , 1998 ; Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003 ; Bowers , Regehr , Balthazard , & Parker , 1990 ; Dallob & Dominowski , 1993 ; Dorfman , Shames , & Kihlstrom , 1996 ; Schooler & Melcher , 1995 ; Shames , 1994 ; Smith & Blankenship , 1989 ) . They have also been used in a vari - ety of innovative ways , including in the study of psycho - pathologies ( e . g . , Fodor , 1999 ) , affect ( e . g . , Mikulincer & Sheffi , 2000 ) , and success and failure experiences ( e . g . , Vohs & Heatherton , 2001 ) , and as an alternative to illusory feedback ( e . g . , McFarlin & Blascovich , 1984 ) . In addition , Hebrew , Japanese , and Jamaican versions have been implemented ( Baba , 1982 ; Hamilton , 1982 ; Nevo & Levin , 1978 ) . Although RAT items are not as complex as classic in - sight problems , they exhibit the three properties of insight problems that distinguish insight solutions from noninsight solutions : ( 1 ) They misdirect ( or fail to direct ) retrieval pro - cesses . ( 2 ) Solvers often cannot report the processing that has led them to the solution ( Ben - Zur , 1989 ) . ( 3 ) Upon solving RAT items , solvers often have the Aha ! experience ( Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003 ) . This third property is considered the central defining feature of insight prob - lems . Thus , solving RAT - like items appears to involve the same component processes critical for , and the same phe - nomenological experience of , insight solutions to more complex problems . In general , researchers using classic insight problems have faced two difficulties . Typical ( classic ) insight prob - lems are usually complex , so that participants are able to attempt few such problems ( occasionally only one ) in an experimental session . The use of only a few problems greatly reduces the reliability of the data collected . Fur - thermore , the complexity of typical insight problems can lead to the confounding of variables , which hinders the clear decomposition of the component processes of prob - lem solving .

Normative data for 144 compound remote associate problems EDWARD M . BOWDEN and MARK JUNG - BEEMAN Northwestern University , Evanston , Illinois We have developed and tested 144 compound remote associate problems . Across eight experiments , 289 participants were given four time limits ( 2 sec , 7 sec , 15 sec , or 30 sec ) for solving each problem . This paper provides a brief overview of the problems and normative data regarding the percentage of participants solving , and mean time - to - solution for , each problem at each time limit . These normative data can be used in selecting problems on the basis of difficulty or mean time necessary for reaching a solution . COMPOUND REMOTE ASSOCIATE PROBLEMS 635 several advantages over classic insight problems : ( 1 ) They can be solved in a short time , so that many can be at - tempted in a single experimental session of 1 h or less . ( 2 ) They are simpler than classic insight problems , thus allowing better control of possible confounding vari - ables . ( 3 ) They have single - word , unambiguous solu - tions , making scoring of responses easier . ( 4 ) They are physically compact , so that they can be presented in a small visual space or short time span . These features allow for better control and measurement of timing vari - ables ( e . g . , measuring the time between presentation of the problem and production of a solution , controlling timing of hint presentation or timing of solution presen - tation for solution judgment tasks , etc . ) and display vari - ables ( e . g . , position of the problem and / or solution on the screen ) . These features also allow for the use of var - ious paradigms ( e . g . , priming , solution recognition , and hemispheric differences paradigms ) . METHOD Participants Participants were 289 students from the University of Wisconsin , Parkside , the University of Illinois , Chicago , and the University of Pennsylvania . Materials Mednick’s ( 1962 ) original versions of the RAT con - tained 30 items each , and the solution word for each item was sometimes associated with the words in a triad in several different ways . We wanted a greater number of problems than were available in the original RAT . We also wanted to present participants with a more consis - tent task—that is , the solution word would always be re - lated to the triad words in the same way . To this end , we created our own set of problems , so that the solution word was associated with all three words of the triad through formation of a compound word ( or phrase ) ( e . g . , AGE / MILE / SAND form the compounds STONEAGE , MILE - STONE , and SANDSTONE with the solution word STONE ) . Solution words were never repeated or used as problem words ; problem words were sometimes repeated ( e . g . , house is repeated six times ) . The result was 144 com - pound remote associate problems . We provide normative data for the solvability of these items in the Appendix . Procedure The participants were tested individually . They were told that they would see three stimulus words and that they should attempt to generate a fourth word , which , when combined with each of the three stimulus words , would result in word pairs that make up a common com - pound word or phrase . The participants were given five practice problems prior to the experiment itself . Each trial began with the participant fixating a cross posi - tioned at the center of the screen . So that the participant could see all three words with minimal eye movement , the problem words were then presented simultaneously in normal horizontal orientation above , at , and below the center of the screen . The participant tried to produce the solution word within a time limit . In the six experiments there were three different time limits ( 2 , 7 , and 15 sec ) . Immediately following the production of a solution , or the end of the time limit , the participant was shown a lat - eralized target word for 180 msec and was either to read the word aloud quickly or to judge whether the word was the solution to the problem . Only data regarding problem solution within the time limit are presented in this article ; data regarding reading or judgments of the target words , and details of the procedure , are presented elsewhere ( Beeman & Bowden , 2000 ; Bowden & Beeman , 1998 ) . The problems were presented by a Macintosh computer in 24 - point Times font , black on a white background . In two other experiments ( one using electroencephalog - raphy [ EEG ] and one using functional magnetic reso - nance imaging [ fMRI ] procedures ) , participants tried to produce the solution word within a 30 - sec time limit . In these two experiments , each trial began with a central fixation cross ; then the three problem words were pre - sented simultaneously in normal horizontal orientation above , at , and below the center of the screen . The prob - lem stayed on the screen until it was solved or the time limit expired . No target words were shown following the solution or time limit . There were several potentially important differences between these two experiments and the previous six . Both EEG and fMRI procedures create less than optimal conditions for problem solving , so the results may un - derestimate participants’ performance under better con - ditions . Because of the need for scalp electrode place - ment and the use of 186 problems , this EEG experiment involved very long sessions ( up to 4 h ) . 1 To minimize eye movement , the problems were presented in a smaller font than in the previous experiments ( 14 - point Arial font , yellow on a black background ) . In fMRI experiments , the scanner creates a noisy environment and participants’ heads are held in position with cushions in an effort to eliminate head movement artifacts . In addition , partici - pants in this fMRI experiment saw 124 of the 144 prob - lems and did a line comparison task after each problem - solving trial . 2 Despite these differences in procedures , there was a high correlation for percentage of participants solving the problems in the EEG and fMRI experiments [ r ( 124 ) = . 80 ] . Therefore , we combined the data for the 30 - sec time limit from both the EEG and the fMRI experiments . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Participants who had been excluded from previously published analyses ( Beeman & Bowden , 2000 ; Bowden & Beeman , 1998 ) because they were left - handed or had solved too few problems were included in these analyses to give an accurate picture of the difficulty of the items . We calculated the percentage of participants solving each problem within each of the time limits . We also cal - 636 BOWDEN AND JUNG - BEEMAN culated the mean time - to - solution , in seconds , for the 7 - , 15 - , and 30 - sec time limits . 3 These data are presented in the Appendix in descending order according to the per - centage of participants producing a solution within the 15 - sec time limit . Correlations between time limits were calculated for the percentage of participants solving the problems . The correlation matrix is presented in Table 1 . These problems can be divided into two types : homo - geneous , for which the solution word is a prefix ( or suf - fix ) to all three words of the problem triad , and hetero - geneous , for which the solution word is a prefix ( suffix ) to at least one of the words of the triad and a suffix ( pre - fix ) to the other word ( s ) of the triad . Participants solved approximately the same number of homogeneous prob - lems . For the 85 homogenous problems and 59 hetero - geneous problems , the largest difference in percentage of participants solving was for the 15 - sec solution period with mean percentages solved of 29 % and 33 % for the homogeneous and heterogeneous problems , respectively [ t ( 142 ) = 1 . 07 , p = . 29 ] . Mean percentages solved were 7 . 8 % and 7 . 9 % within 2 sec , 23 . 0 % and 22 . 7 % within 7 sec , and 50 . 5 % and 50 . 4 % within 30 sec ( all p s > . 91 ) . We have used these problems to investigate hemi - spheric contributions to problem solving and the experi - ence of insight . These problems have allowed us to use a visual - hemifield priming paradigm . In these experi - ments , participants attempt to solve problems , and after a time limit ( or after solving ) , they read solution words faster than nonsolution words ( solutions to other prob - lems in the set ) . This solution priming is consistently greater when subjects read target words presented to the left visual field – right hemisphere ( lvf – RH ) than when they read those presented to the right visual field – left hemisphere ( rvf – LH ) . Similarly , people could more quickly recognize , as solutions , solution words presented to the lvf – RH than those presented to the rvf – LH . These RH advantages increase when participants work on the problems longer ( Beeman & Bowden , 2000 ; Bowden & Beeman , 1998 ) and when their seeing the solution words elicits a feeling of insight ( Beeman , Haberman , & Bowden , 2002 ; Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003 ) . We are now in the process of using these problems to investigate incubation , the effects of hints , and ways to interfere with and facilitate problem solving . We have also used these problems to examine neural correlates of insight problem solving . Beginning approx - imately 1 . 3 sec before participants solve these problems , two brief EEG components differ when participants ex - perience insight as opposed to when they do not experi - ence insight . Source localization suggests involvement of cortical areas that mediate conflict resolution , which we have interpreted as overcoming blocking activation . This EEG is accompanied by a slightly slower , but still rapid , increase in alpha wave suppression ( indicating in - creasing neural activity ) localized to RH frontal and tem - poroparietal areas ( Kounios et al . , 2003 ) . Similarly , changes in blood flow assessed by fMRI indicate that there is greater neural activity in the RH superior tem - poral sulcus for the final 2 sec before participants solve problems and experience insight than in the final 2 sec before participants solve problems without insight ( Bee - man , Bowden , & Haberman , 2002 ) . The problems presented in this paper are uncompli - cated in the sense that each one has a single - word , un - ambiguous solution that is related to the three words in the problem in a single consistent way ( i . e . , forms a com - pound word or phrase ) , they can be solved quickly , and are physically compact . These features increase the reli - ability of the data , reduce the confounding of variables aiding in the clear decomposition of the component pro - cesses of problem solving , make scoring of responses easier , allow for control and measurement of timing vari - ables and display variables , and permit the use of various paradigms . Similar problems have been used to study problem solving and creative thinking , psychopathologies , affect , and success and failure experiences , and as an al - ternative to illusory feedback . By providing solvability and time - to - solution data , we hope to encourage the fur - ther use of remote associate problems in these areas and in innovative ways . REFERENCES Ansburg , P . I .

Forty - two new problems were developed for the EEG experiment . Data from these new problems are not presented in this paper . 2 . In the line comparison task , participants saw two sets of lines ( e . g . , / / \ and / \ / ) . The task was to answer “yes” if both sets had the same number of left - leaning and right - leaning lines , or “no” if the sets had a different number of left - leaning and right - leaning lines . In this example , the answer is “yes . ” 3 . Solution time data were not collected for the 2 - sec time limit .
