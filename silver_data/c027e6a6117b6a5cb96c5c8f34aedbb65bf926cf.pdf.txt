In order to better understand the contribution of substrate stiffness to neural stem / progenitor cell ( NSPC ) differentiation and proliferation , a photopolymerizable methacrylamide chitosan ( MAC ) biomaterial was developed . Photopolymerizable MAC is particularlycompelling for the studyof the central nervous system stem cell niche because Young’s elastic modulus ( E Y ) can be tuned from less than 1 kPa to greater than 30 kPa . Additionally , the numerous free amine functional groups enable inclusion of biochemical signaling molecules that , together with the mechanical environment , inﬂuence cell behavior . Herein , NSPCs proliferated on MAC substrates with Young’s elastic moduli below 10 kPa and exhibited maximal proliferation on 3 . 5 kPa surfaces . Neuronal differentiation was favored on the softest surfaces with E Y < 1 kPa as conﬁrmed by both immunohistochemistry and qRT - PCR . Oligodendrocyte differentia - tion was favored on stiffer scaffolds ( > 7 kPa ) ; however , myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ( MOG ) gene expression suggested that oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination was best on < 1 kPa scaffolds where more mature neurons were present . Astrocyte differentiationwas only observed on < 1 and 3 . 5 kPa surfaces and represented less than 2 % of the total cell population . This work demonstrates the importance of substrate stiffness to the proliferation and differentiation of adult NSPCs and highlights the importance of mechanical properties to the success of scaffolds designed to engineer central nervous system tissue .

These multipotent cells have been termed adult or somatic stem cells [ 1 ] . Adult stem cells reside within specialized microenvironments or niches incorporating numerous cell - speciﬁc cues . These cues are immensely complex but can be broadly grouped into three primary interactions : cell – cell , cell – biochemical factorand cell – matrix . Understanding the cues present in the adult stem cell niche enables the formulation of regenerative strategies that combine biomaterial design with stem cell delivery . Tissue engineering scaffold designs must incorporate cues of the native stem cell niche in order to precisely guide cell functions such as proliferation , migration and differentiation . Populations of stem cells have been identiﬁed in the adult central nervoussystem ( CNS ) thatpossesstheabilityto self - renew , generate identical progeny and differentiate into the primary cell types found in the CNS : neurons , oligodendrocytes and astrocytes [ 2 – 4 ] . These neural stem / progenitor cells ( NSPCs ) have been isolated from two neurogenic regions of the adult brain , the hippocampus and sub - ventricularzone ( SVZ ) , aswellasanon - neurogenicregion , thespinal cord [ 2 – 4 ] . Recently , adult SVZ - derived NSPCs were isolated from living human patients and demonstrated self - renewal and multi - potentiality [ 5 ] . NSPCs offer an attractive means of regenerating lost or damaged CNS tissue after disease or injury ; however , our current understanding of the cues that drive proliferation , lineage commit - ment and speciﬁcation in these cells is primarily limited to biochemical factors [ 6 – 9 ] . Recent work has shown that the mechanical properties of the matrix impact the differentiation proﬁle of stem cells [ 10 ] . For example , ﬁbroblasts and epithelial cells cultured on gels of varied moduli revealed that substratestiffness can alterECM assembly , cell spreading and cell motility [ 11 , 12 ] . Although the molecular path - ways are yet to be characterized , it has been speciﬁcally shown that anchorage dependent cells are responsive to the mechanical prop - erties of their matrix [ 10 – 20 ] . Of particular interest to central nervous system ( CNS ) regeneration are studies that have examined neuronal , glial and , most recently , hippocampus - derived NSPC responses to substrate elasticity [ 13 , 16 , 19 , 20 ] . Native brain tissue is one of the softest tissues in the body ( elastic modulus ( E ) ¼ 0 . 5 – 1 kPa [ 21 , 22 ] ) compared to skeletal muscle ( E w 10 kPa [ 23 ] ) , cartilage ( E w 500 kPa [ 24 ] ) and cortical bone ( E w 15 (cid:2) 10 6 kPa [ 25 ] ) . Additionally , the brain is made of many structures such as * Corresponding author . Donelly CCBR Room 514 , 160 College St , Toronto , ON M5S 3E1 , Canada .

In vitro studies have shown that neurons , glia and NSPCs respond best to soft substrates . Neurons prefer compliant hydrogel surfaces ( E < 1 kPa ) [ 13 , 16 ] whereas astrocytes prefer slightly stiffer hydrogel surfaces ( E ¼ 9 kPa ) [ 19 ] . Similarly , hippocampus - derived NSPCs differen - tiate into neurons on very soft substrates yet into astrocytes on stiffer substrates [ 20 ] . The study by Saha et al . [ 20 ] established a range of substrate stiffnesses to which NSPCs respond ( E 0 . 01 – 10 kPa ) ; however , differentiation to oligodendrocytes was not explored . Moreover , NSPCs utilized for experimentation were passaged up to 30 times , inevitablyaltering their growth properties , growth factor dependence , cell adhesion and gene expression [ 28 ] . The primary objective of this study was to determine the optimal hydrogel elastic modulus for NSPC proliferation and differentiation into all of the primary CNS lineages : neurons , oligodendrocytes and astrocytes . To accomplish this , a photocrosslinkable methacrylamide chitosan ( MAC ) was developed where the concentrations of a non - toxic photoinitiator and solvent were varied to control the Young’s elastic modulus ( E Y ) of the resulting hydrogels . Photocrosslinkable MAC provides a system where niche cues responsible for prolifera - tionanddifferentiationcanbeidentiﬁed , incorporatedandtranslated to future 3D studies . To encourage cell adhesion , laminin , a well - known extracellular matrix protein of the nervous system [ 29 ] , was incorporated into the stem cell niche design . To ensure relevant results , low passage NSPCs were seeded as single cells on these gels and total cell number , gene expression and immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) were characterized over time after 0 , 4 and 8 d of culture . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Methacrylamide chitosan synthesis and hydrogel formation MAC was synthesized as described previously [ 30 ] . To form hydrogels , freeze - dried MAC was dissolved in distilled and deionized water ( Millipore Milli - RO 10 Plus and Milli - Q UF Plus system at 18 M U resistance ; Billerica , MA , USA ) at 2 wt % then autoclaved . The photoinitiator 2 , 2 - dimethoxy - 2 - phenylacetophenone ( DMAP ; Sigma – Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) was dissolved into 1 - vinyl - 2 - pyrrolidone ( NVP ; Sigma – Aldrich ) at 300 mg DMAP per mL NVP . DMAP / NVP was sterile ﬁltered through a 0 . 2 m m ﬁlter , added to 2 wt % MAC at varied concentrations v / w ( 1 . 5 – 30 m l DMAP / NVP per g MAC ) and mixed / deaerated ( SpeedMixer DAC 150 FVZ ; Hauschild Engineering , Hamm , Germany ) . The resulting mixture was transferred to a well plate ( enough to coat a 48 or 96 well ) and crosslinked with 2 min UV light ( 365 nm ) exposure . Wells were washed in sterile PBS 4 times overnight , and then coated with laminin ( 5 m g / mL in neurobasal media ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) for 4 h . 2 . 2 . Mechanical testing Mechanical properties were assessed via stress – relaxation tests in uniaxial , unconﬁned compression using a Mach - 1 micromechanical testing system ( Bio - Syntech , Laval , QC , Canada ) . MAC hydrogels were photocrosslinked , cut into 4 mm disks using biopsy punches and allowed to equilibrate for 1 d in PBS with protease inhibitors ( 2 m M EDTA , 5 m M benzamidine HCl , 10 m M N - ethylmaleimide , 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride ; Sigma – Aldrich ) at 4 (cid:3) C . Samples were exposed to a 2 g tare , and then were compressed to 10 % of the tare thickness at a strain rate of 1 % s (cid:4) 1 . Five samples were tested for each treatment group . After the ramp displacement , stress – relaxation continued until equilibrium was reached . A simple elastic model [ 31 ] was used to determine the E Y for each sample that was tested based on the equilibrium stress , tare height and test height . 2 . 3 . Scanning electron microscopy UV crosslinked MAC hydrogels were prepared as described in Section 2 . 1 . To prepare them for scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , samples were critical point dried inethanol thensputtercoatedwith gold . Samples wereimagedusing aPhilips XL30 ESEM ( Phillips - FEI , Hillsboro , OR , USA ) with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and spot size of 4 . 0 . 2 . 4 . Quantiﬁcation of total adsorbed laminin Laminin was modiﬁed with a ﬂuorescent tag to facilitate quantiﬁcation after surface adsorption . Lamininproteinwas reacted with 5 - ( and - 6 ) - carboxyﬂuorescein , succinimidyl ester ( 5 ( 6 ) - FAM , SE ; Biotium , Hayward , CA , USA ) at 10 times molar excess in PBS for 2 h . The resulting FAM labeled laminin was puriﬁed by HPLC ( PhenomenexBioSep - SEC - S - 2000 , 300by7 . 8 mm , PBSbufferat1 mL / min ; Torrance , CA , USA ) . The puriﬁed protein concentration was determined via absorbance measurementat280 nm ( 6 . 15 (cid:2) 10 5 cm (cid:4) 1 M (cid:4) 1 extinctioncoefﬁcient ; NanoDropND - 1000 spectrophotometer ; NanoDrop Technologies , Wilmington , DE , USA ) . MAC gels were photocrosslinked in 96 well plates , washed in PBS 4 times overnight , then coatedwith FAM – laminin for 4 h in PBS . The plateswere placed in a 37 (cid:3) C incubator and the PBS was fully changed at days 0 , 1 d and a half volume change was per - formed at 4 d . The concentration of laminin adsorbed to gels was determined via ﬂuorescent measurement ( 495 nm excitation , 519 nm emission ; Molecular Devices SpectraMAX Gemini EM , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) and quantiﬁed by comparison to a standard curve . 2 . 5 . Cell isolation and culture NSPCs were isolated from the subependymal region of the lateral ventricles in the forebrain of adult female Wistar rats and expanded in neurosphere culture as explained previously [ 32 ] . NSPCs were expanded in growth medium containing neurobasal media ( Invitrogen ) , B27 neural supplement ( Invitrogen ) , 2 m M L - glutamine ( Sigma – Aldrich ) , 100 m g / mL penicillin – streptomycin ( Sigma – Aldrich ) , 20ng / mL epidermal growth factor ( EGF – recombinant human ; Invitrogen ) , 20 ng / mL basic ﬁbroblastic growth actor ( bFGF – recombinant human bFGF ; Invitrogen ) and 2 m g / mL heparin ( Sigma – Aldrich ) . The resulting neurospheres were passaged 3 – 4 times before experimentation . Neurospheres were dissociated into single cells by pipetting and then counted with a hemocytometer using trypan blue ( Sigma – Aldrich ) exclusion . Dissociated cells were plated on the surface of MAC hydrogels in growth media and incubated at 37 (cid:3) C and 5 % CO 2 and cultured for 18 h . The growth media was removed and replaced with differentiation medium containing neurobasal media , 2 m M L - glutamine , 100 m g / mL penicillin – streptomycin , and 1 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) . Cells were cultured in differentiation medium for an additional 7 d . To test the cytotoxicity response to photocrosslinked MAC , NSPCs were plated on laminin - coated glass coverslips ( 2 cm diameter ) in a 24 well plate and allowed to attach for 4 h . Photocrosslinked hydrogels were made by adding photoinitiator / solvent ( DMAP / NVP ) at v / w concentrations of 1 . 5 – 30 m L per g of MAC . 0 . 5 mL of the resulting mixtures were added to a 48 cell plate , exposed to UV light , and then washed three times with PBS . These MAC hydrogels were placed in culture inserts ( 0 . 4 m m , BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) and placed in the same well plate as NSPCs , forming two compartments sharing the same media . This allowed cells to be exposed to MAC scaffolds without direct contact . A control group was included with a cell culture insert and no MAC scaffold ( media ) . Culturing was performed for 1 d in growth media followed by 7 d in differentiation media . Table 1 Primer and probe designs for quantitative RT - PCR .

Quantiﬁcation of total cell number Cells were lysed after 4 and 8 d by freeze - thaw in 1 (cid:2) Tris - EDTA buffer and 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma – Aldrich ) . Total double - stranded DNA was measured by ﬂuo - rescence ( MolecularDevices ) viathereactionofDNAwithPicoGreendye ( PicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation Kit ; Invitrogen ) . 2 . 1 pg of DNA / cell was used to convert concentration of dsDNA to total number of cells , as was experimentally determined for rat SVZ - derived NSPCs . 2 . 7 . Immunohistochemistry The following primary antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) : monoclonal mouse anti - b - III tubulin ( 1 : 1000 ; Abcam , Cambridge , MA , USA ) for neurons ; monoclonal anti - RIP ( 1 : 5 ; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , Iowa City , IA , USA ) foroligodendrocytes ; andmonoclonal mouseanti - glial ﬁbrillaryacidic protein ( GFAP , 1 : 100 ; Cell Sciences , Canton , MA , USA ) forastrocytes and monoclonal mouseanti - nestin ( 1 : 500 ; BDBiosciences , SanJose , CA , USA ) . ForallIHCprocedures , appropriate controls were obtained by omission of the relevant primary antibody . Cells on MAC substrates were ﬁxed after 4 and 8 d of culture with PBS solution containing 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Sigma – Aldrich ) for 20 min at room temperature and then washed with PBS 3 times . Cell membranes were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 10 min , washed 3 times then blocked with a solution of 10 % FBS in PBS at room temperature for 1 h . Next , each primary antibody solution was added for 24 h at 4 (cid:3) C . After washing with PBS 3 times , samples were exposed to secondary goat anti - mouse IgG Alexa - Fluor 546 ( 1 : 400 ; Invitrogen ) for 2 h at room temperature and then washed with PBS buffer 3 times . Finally , cell nuclei were counterstained with 10 m M Hoechst 33342 ( Invitrogen ) for 7 min , washed with PBS bufferandmounted / coverslippedusingProLongGoldanti - fadereagent ( Invitrogen ) . 2 . 8 . Total RNA isolation and real - time RT - PCR Cells were lysed at days 0 , 4 and 8 and total RNA was isolated using the RNA - queous micro kit ( Ambion , Austin , TX , USA ) . Day 0 samples were obtained from the cell seeding solution . After RNA isolation , DNase I treatment was performed fol - lowed by the measurement of total RNA concentration and purity ( NanoDrop ND - 1000 ) . For the reverse transcription ( RT ) reaction , 15 . 7 m L of RNA ( at 5 ng total RNA / m L ) was incubated with oligo ( dT ) primers and random hexamers at 65 (cid:3) C for 5 min . After cooling to room temperature , the RNA - oligo ( dT ) / hexamer mix , buffer , dNTPs , RNase inhibitor , Stratagene and AfﬁnityScript RT enzyme ( La Jolla , CA , USA ) was incubated for 60 min at 42 (cid:3) C . The reaction was terminated by 70 (cid:3) C for 15 min . Quantitative reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) ampliﬁca - tionwas performedwithan AppliedBiosystems7900HT ( Foster City , CA , USA ) using SYBR Green I ( Invitrogen ) detection chemistry . The 5 0 – 3 0 sequences for the forward primers and reverse primers were designed from rat mRNA sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) and are given in Table 1 . For qRT - PCR analysis of each sample , the following were prepared in a 11 m L reaction buffer : 1 m L of DNA sample , 1 (cid:2) buffer , 3 - 4 m M MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 m M DNTPs , 200 – 400 n M of each forward and reverse primer , 0 . 5 (cid:2) SYBR Green I , 1 (cid:2) ROX reference dye ( Sigma – Aldrich ) , and 0 . 055 U HotStarTaq ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA ) . Quantitative RT - PCR ampliﬁcation was achieved with a 15 min activation step at 95 (cid:3) C , followed by 50 cycles of 15 s at 94 (cid:3) C , 30 s at 60 (cid:3) C , 60 s at 72 (cid:3) C and a ﬂuorescence measurement . All qRT - PCR reactions were performed in triplicate . A standard curve ( cycle Fig . 1 .

Hydrogel properties The concentration of DMAP in NVP was varied to control the elastic modulus of the resulting photocrosslinked methacrylamide chitosan gels . By increasing the concentration of DMAP dissolved in NVP while maintaining both the UV exposure time and the concen - tration of methacrylamide , a series of crosslinked methacrylamide gels were synthesized and characterized interms of their mechanical propertiesandporesizedistribution . CrosslinkedMACscaffoldswere produced with elastic moduli ranging from < 1 to 20 kPa using 1 . 5 to 15 m l of 300 mg / mL of DMAP / NVP and 1 g of 2 wt % MAC dissolved in water . On MAC hydrogels with E Y < 10 kPa , NSPCs proliferated , formed colonies and differentiated ( Fig . 1 ) , whereas on MAC hydro - gels with E Y (cid:6) 10 kPa , cells exhibited neither a proliferative response nor colony formation , differentiating primarily to oligodendrocytes ( > 75 % of the total population ) with little to no neuron and astrocyte differentiation ( data not shown ) . Consequently , NSPCs’ responses were studied on MAC scaffolds with E Y < 10 kPa . Three crosslinked MAC scaffolds were synthesized using 1 . 5 , 3 . 0 and 6 . 0 m L of 300 mg / mL DMAP / NMP with 1 g of 2 wt % MAC inwater resulting in scaffolds with E Y equal to 0 . 80 (cid:5) 0 . 18 , 3 . 59 (cid:5) 0 . 51 and 6 . 72 (cid:5) 0 . 58 kPa , referred to as < 1 , 3 . 5 and 7 kPa , respectively . The porosity of these hydrogels was examined by scanning electron microscopy . SEM images of UV - crosslinked MAC showed a porous network which varied slightly among the three Young’s elastic moduli materials studied ( Fig . 2A ) . Increasing Young’s elastic modulus resulted in more crosslinks and smaller internal pores . Fig . 2 . ( A ) SEM and ( B ) quantiﬁcation of laminin adsorbed ontoMAC hydrogel surfaces . SEMof criticallypoint dried and goldsputtercoated MAC hydrogels shows that the surface is made up of a tightly crosslinked network and that the porosity decreases as E Y increases . Fluorescently tagged ( FAM ) – laminin protein was adsorbed to MAC hydrogel surfaces and incubated at 37 (cid:3) C with PBS changed after days 0 , 1 and 4 . Quantiﬁcation of the amount of FAM – laminin on surfaces revealed that the concentration did not signiﬁcantly vary with scaffold stiffness or time ( two - factor ANOVA , p > 0 . 1 ) . Data are presented as mean (cid:5) SD , n ¼ 3 . N . D . Leipzig , M . S . Shoichet / Biomaterials 30 ( 2009 ) 6867 – 6878 6870 Despite the observed differences in crosslinking density , the amount of laminin adsorbed to these three MAC surfaces was not statistically different and did not change signiﬁcantly with time ( Fig . 2B , p > 0 . 1 ) ; however , a trend was observed towards more laminin adsorption on stiffer MAC for all time points . 3 . 2 . Cytocompatibility of MAC hydrogels MAC hydrogels were shown to be compatible with NSPCs irre - spective of crosslinker concentrations of DMAP / NVP between 1 . 5 and 30 v / w ( Fig . 3 ) . Cells proliferated in all treatment groups as evidenced by signiﬁcantly higher total cell numbers relative to day 0 samples ( p < 0 . 0001 ) . 3 . 3 . Cells cultured on MAC hydrogels NSPCs were plated on the three MAC hydrogels with different moduli and found to adhere and form colonies on MAC gels with E Y equal to < 1 , 3 . 5 and 7 kPa ( Fig . 4 ) . The 3 . 5 kPasurfaces generatedthe largest colonies , especially by culture day 8 . Cell process extension and migration was only observed on < 1 kPa MAC scaffolds , ﬁrst appearing at 4 d of culture and noticeably increasing by day 8 . NSPCs proliferated on all three surfaces as measured quantita - tively for total cell number during the culture period ( Fig . 5 ) . The resulting cell doubling times on < 1 , 3 . 5 and 7 kPa MAC were 139 . 5 , 111 . 4 and 185 . 67 h , respectively . By day 8 , total cell numbers on MAC surfaces were signiﬁcantly higher than day 0 ( p < 0 . 0001 ) . The 3 . 5 kPa MAC surfaces supported the most cells at both days 4 and 8 ( p < 0 . 001 ) . 3 . 4 . Immunohistochemistry NSPCs primarily differentiated into oligodendrocytes on MAC surfaces . Fluorescent microscopy showed that the majority of RIP positive cells were found in colonies on the MAC surfaces ( Fig . 6A ) and that these cells formed interconnected networks with other RIP positive cells . The 7 kPa surfaces yielded more RIP - positive oligo - dendrocytes ( 71 . 8 (cid:5) 2 . 7 % ) than the less stiff surfaces where 67 . 5 (cid:5) 5 . 6 % and 59 . 4 (cid:5) 2 . 6 % oligodendrocytes were observed on 3 . 5 and < 1 kPa surfaces , respectively ( Fig . 6A , p < 0 . 001 ) . The < 1 kPa MAC hydrogels signiﬁcantly promoted both b III - tubulin positive neuron and GFAP positive astrocyte differentiation over the 3 . 5 and 7 kPa MAC surfaces ( Fig . 6B , C , p < 0 . 0001 ) . The < 1 kPa MAC resulted in 32 . 9 (cid:5) 2 . 0 % neurons whereas the 3 . 5 kPa resulted in 22 . 5 (cid:5) 1 . 7 % neurons and the 7 kPa in 11 . 6 (cid:5) 0 . 8 % neurons . b III tubulin positive cells ( neurons ) were observed interspersed in colonies on all surfaces yet migrated out of colonies on only < 1 kPa surfaces ( Fig . 6B ) . GFAP positive cells ( astrocytes ) only appeared in large colonies at low frequencies ( 1 . 9 (cid:5) 0 . 4 % on < 1 kPa and 1 . 0 (cid:5) 0 . 3 % on 3 . 5 kPa ) and were not observed on 7 kPa surfaces ( Fig . 6C ) . 3 . 5 . Quantitative RT - PCR Quantitative RT - PCR analysis for oligodendrocyte markers demonstrated that < 1 kPa MAC yielded the highest mRNA levels of CNPase , anearlyexpressedmatureoligodendrocytemarker , atday8 with an 11 . 8 (cid:5) 1 . 7 fold increase over day 0 ( Fig . 7A , p < 0 . 0001 ) . Similarly , < 1 kPasurfaces yielded the highestexpression of the later expressed mature oligodendrocyte marker MOG with a 15 . 5 (cid:5) 2 . 6 fold increase over day 0 ( Fig . 7B , p < 0 . 0001 ) . MOG expression increased over the culture period on both < 1 and 3 . 5 kPa MAC yet was not detectable on 7 kPa surfaces . The transcriptional marker OLIG1 was signiﬁcantly upregulated on 3 . 5 kPa surfaces at day 4 with a 2 . 1 (cid:5) 0 . 1 fold increase relative to day 0 ( Fig . 7C , p < 0 . 001 ) . However , on day 8 OLIG1 expression on all surfaces returned to day 0 levels ( Fig . 7C , p > 0 . 05 ) . MAC surfaces with an E Y < 1 kPa yielded the highest mRNA levels for three neuronal markers : b III tubulin , NSE , DCX . Expres - sion of b III tubulin , an early neuronal marker , reached the greatest levels by day 8 on < 1 kPa MAC with a 2 . 8 (cid:5) 0 . 2 fold increase from day 0 ( Fig . 8A , p < 0 . 0001 ) . Messenger - RNA levels for the mature neuronal marker NSE , signiﬁcantly increased by day 8 of culture for Fig . 3 . Toxicity response of NSPCs to UV crosslinked MAC scaffolds after 8 d . MAC hydrogels were formed using photoinitiator / solvent ( DMAP / NVP ) at v / w concentrations of 0 ( media only ) to 30 m L per g of MAC . NSPCs were seeded onto laminin - coated glass coverslips and cultured for 8 d in wells in which MAC scaffolds had been placed in transwell inserts . Thus the NSPCs were exposed to MAC scaffolds but not in direct contact with them for the 8 d culture period . The total cell number for each treatment group demonstrated that the UV crosslinked MAC hydrogels were not cytotoxic and NSPCs proliferated in the presence of gels comprising 5 . 0 – 15 v / w DMAP / NVP as compared to media alone controls ( p < 0 . 0001 ) .

Expression of the neuron migrational marker DCX at day 8 only increased on < 1 kPa MAC with a 1 . 6 (cid:5) 0 . 2 fold increase over day 0 ( Fig . 8C , p < 0 . 001 ) . Expression of the mature astrocyte markers GFAP and S100B signiﬁcantly increased on < 1 and 3 . 5 kPa MAC over the culture period . By day 8 , GFAP mRNA levels reached a 70 . 7 (cid:5) 13 . 2 fold increase on < 1 kPa hydrogels followed by a 28 . 7 (cid:5) 13 . 2 fold increase over day 0 on 3 . 5 kPa MAC surfaces ( Fig . 9A , p < 0 . 0001 ) . GFAP expression was not detected in cells cultured on 7 kPa MAC . The expression of S100B signiﬁcantly increased at day 8 for < 1 and 3 . 5 kPa scaffolds with a 4 . 6 (cid:5) 0 . 8 and 3 . 2 (cid:5) 0 . 8 fold increase , respectively , over day 0 ( Fig . 9B , p < 0 . 05 ) . Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that expression of the progenitor markers , nestin and PAX6 , decreased over 8 d of culture . Nestin mRNA levels signiﬁcantly decreased for all treatments ( Fig . 9C , p < 0 . 05 ) . On < 1 and 3 . 5 kPa surfaces , expression of PAX6 , a marker tied to neuronal progenitor formation [ 34 , 35 ] , remained the same at day 4 before down regulating expression to unde - tectable levels by day 8 ( Fig . 9D , p < 0 . 0001 ) . 4 . Discussion The microenvironmental stimuli necessary to guide stem cell behavior are beginning to be understood . These stimuli involve a complex combination of chemical and physical cues and are highly dependentoncelltypeaswellastheirtissueoforigin . Thestiffnessof the matrix has been recently shown to be important to both differ - entiated and undifferentiated cell types derived from the nervous system [ 13 , 16 , 19 , 20 ] . Our primary goal was to determine how the substrate stiffness of a biomaterial scaffold inﬂuenced proliferation and differentiation of low passage SVZ - derived adult NSPCs , an adult stem cell that has demonstrated clinical relevance [ 5 ] . MAC offers a valuable platform for studying NSPC responses to substrate stiffness in mixed differentiation media conditions ( 1 % FBS ) because the elastic modulus can be easily tuned while providing a cell - adhesive environment . By controlling the amount of photoinitiator included in the UV crosslinking reaction , substrate stiffness ( E Y ) was tuned to match that of CNStissue ( Fig . 3 ) . Scaffolds with compressive E Y ranging from < 1 kPa to 30 kPa were easily created from solutions containing equal weight percentages of MAC Fig . 4 . Representative images of NSPCs seeded and differentiated on MAC hydrogels of varied substrate stiffness over 8 d of culture . Cells attach as single cells and proliferate on all surfaces in the form of colonies . 3 . 5 kPa MAC surfaces stimulated the largest colonies by day 8 . Cell process formation and migration out of colonies was only observed on < 1 kPa surfaces . N . D . Leipzig , M . S . Shoichet / Biomaterials 30 ( 2009 ) 6867 – 6878 6872 Fig . 5 .

Transwell cultures demonstrated that UV crosslinked MAC did not adversely affect NSPC cell survival or proliferation ( Fig . 3 ) , validating its use in cell culture experiments . Following meth - acrylamide crosslinking , MAC hydrogels had over 50 % of its repeat units functionalized with primary amines [ 30 ] , facilitating covalent immobilization or ionic interactions of biomolecules . For example , we recently demonstrated that IFN - g can be immobilized to the surface of MAC hydrogels through amide bond formation , stimu - lating the differentiation of adult rat SVZ - derived NSPCs into neurons [ 36 ] . Thus , MACprovides a systemwherethe effectsof both stiffness and biochemical factors can be investigated . In this study , we show that adult SVZ - derived NSPC behavior varies markedly based on the mechanical properties of the culture substrate . Proliferation occurred on substrates with E Y < 1 – 7 kPa ( Fig . 5 ) and culture images ( Fig . 4 ) reveal that this proliferation occurred in the form of colonies that increased in size throughout the 8 d culture period . Proliferation and colony formation ceased on MAC surfaces with E Y (cid:6) 10 kPa ( Fig . 1 ) . The greatest total cell numbers were seen on 3 . 5 kPa MAC surfaces which corresponded to the largest adherent colonies . Taken together , these results show that NSPC self - renewal is optimal between < 1 and 7 kPa , indicating a connection to cell mechanotransductive pathways . The most likely candidate pathways would be linked to the mechanism by which cells anchor to substrates utilizing integrin - mediated focal adhesions ( as reviewed in [ 37 ] ) . Laminin was included in all culture experiments to better mimic the adhesive environment found in the native NSPC niche as well as to facilitate activation of integrins and stimulate focal adhesion formation [ 29 ] . Studies of integrin - mediated mechanosensing have demonstrated that this mecha - nism begins with integrin activation which in turn directs integrin binding kinetics and clustering [ 38 , 39 ] . Tension has also been shown to initiate conformational changes to integrins , leading to higher activation states [ 40 ] . In light of these data , our data suggest that stiffness / compliance of the substrate may also alter spatial presentation of ECM binding ligands to their integrin receptors , leading to altered binding afﬁnities and subsequent changes in transcriptional regulation of NSPC proliferation and differentiation ; however , the consequences to downstream cell signaling pathways have not been elucidated . Integrin activation is vital to cell function , however , activation of growth factor receptors and crosstalk with integrins is required to control both cell proliferation and differentiation [ 41 ] . The combi - nation of these sensing modalities instructs the cellular response . On soft MAC surfaces ( < 1 – 7 . 5 kPa ) , integrin activation is likely an early event in the culture period ( days 0 – 4 ) , contributing to the proliferative response and initial formation of colonies . However , cell attachment likely transitions to a combination of integrins and other cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) as the cell colonies grow to exclude direct interactions of many of the cells in the colony with MAC surfaces . However , since cells in neurosphere colonies are Fig . 7 .

CNPase mRNA expression was greatest on < 1 kPa MAC ( p < 0 . 0001 ) by 8 d . The mature marker MOG was only detectable on < 1 kPa and 3 . 5 kPa surfaces and the greatest mRNA levels by 8 d on < 1 kPa MAC ( p < 0 . 0001 ) . The transcriptional factor OLIG1 had increased expression only for 3 . 5 ka surfaces on day 4 ( p < 0 . 001 ) and mRNA levels trended downward for all three hydrogels by 8 d .

Shoichet / Biomaterials 30 ( 2009 ) 6867 – 6878 6874 known to actively secrete and assemble laminin [ 42 , 43 ] , integrin activation likely remains a dominant cellular event throughout the culture period . Results from IHC differentiation assays show that very soft surfaces best stimulate neuronal differentiation and that signiﬁ - cantly more neurons were observed when the elastic modulus of the surface was decreased ( p < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 6B ) . These neuronal differentiation results are similar to the stiffness mediated response of adult hippocampal - derived NPSCs [ 20 ] . Close observation of IHC images showed that neurons existed on < 1 kPa MAC surfaces in both colonies as well as directly on the surfaces , whereas neurons were nearly entirely observed in colonies on 3 . 5 and 7 kPa surfaces . These observations conﬁrm that neurons prefer hydrogel surfaces with E Y < 1 kPa . Quantitative RT - PCR conﬁrmed that neuronal speciﬁc gene expression was highest on < 1 kPa surfaces ( Fig . 8 ) . Compared to < 1 kPa MAC , neuronal mRNA levels were lower on 3 . 5 kPa surfaces and even lower on 7 kPa surfaces where NSPCs maintained day 0 expressional levels for all neuronal markers assayed . This baseline mRNA expression was sufﬁcient to result in 11 . 6 (cid:5) 0 . 8 % of NSPCs differentiating into neurons by day 8 ( Fig . 6B ) . The mRNA levels of the neuronal migrational marker DCX conﬁrmedtheincreasedcell migrationthat was observedon < 1 kPa MAC by day 8 ( Fig . 4 ) and suggests that a portion of these cells may be neurons undergoing chain migration , a process involving coor - dinated and radial cell movement that is unique to neurons differ - entiated from the SVZ [ 3 , 44 ] . Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that NSPCs differentiated primarily into oligodendrocytes on all substrates with 60 % or more of all cells staining positive for RIP ( Fig . 6B ) . This is consistent with previous reports which demonstrate that adult rat SVZ - derived NSPCs preferentially differentiate into oligodendrocytes in the presence of FBS [ 45 , 46 ] . Interestingly , IHC results demonstrated that stiffer surfaces favored oligodendrocyte differentiation whereas qRT - PCR results for CNPase and MOG expression demonstrated that the least stiff ( < 1 kPa ) MAC surfaces favored oligodendrocyte differentiation ( Fig . 7A and B ) . These results suggest that tran - scriptional levels of CNPase and MOG were elevated on a per cell basis on very soft MAC surfaces . CNPase transcriptional levels did not translate to protein levels ( Fig . 6A ) as RIP and CNPase immu - noreactivity overlap [ 47 ] , however , RIP immunohistochemistry is complex . Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells are both RIP - immunoreactive and reactivity can be increased by the presence of other cell types and tissue injury [ 48 ] . The analysis of MOG gene expression suggests increased oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination on < 1 kPa surfaces and may be a direct result of observed neuronal differentiation and maturation . High MOG mRNA levels are associated with maximal myelin deposition in the white matter where neuronal processes ( axons ) form and mature during development [ 49 ] . On < 1 kPa MAC , high MOG mRNA levels corresponded to the greatest neuronal differentiation ( Figs . 3B and 8 ) . The lack of MOG expression and the least neuronal differentia - tion on 7 kPa MAC suggests that active myelin deposition and Fig . 8 .

NSE also signiﬁcantly increased on < 1 kPa surfaces ( p < 0 . 001 ) and trended upward on 3 . 5 kPa surfaces after 8 d . The migrational marker DCX signiﬁcantly increased on < 1 kPa MAC over the culture period ( p < 0 . 001 ) . All data normalized to HPRT and GAPDH . Statistics by one - factor ANOVA , and means not connected by the same letter are signiﬁcantly different ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Data presented as mean (cid:5) SD , n ¼ 4 . N . D . Leipzig , M . S . Shoichet / Biomaterials 30 ( 2009 ) 6867 – 6878 6875 mature axon formation may not occur on stiffer surfaces ( Fig . 7B ) . Our results demonstrate that a myelinating cell population is present for all stiffnesses of MAC , and that differences in maturation may exist . Quantifying the oligodendrocyte - speciﬁc proteins which arepresentwhen NSPCsaredifferentiatedonMACwill allowamore thorough characterization of the RIP - immunoreactive cells that were observed in Fig . 6A . Additionally , qPCR data ( Fig . 7 ) demon - strate that < 1 kPa MAC generates a CNS - speciﬁc oligodendrocyte populationwith the highestexpressional levels of CNPase , MOGand OLIG1 . Previous work has demonstrated that CNPase , MOG and OLIG1 are expressed in both the CNS and PNS ; however , mRNA levels of these genes are comparativelyhigher in the CNS [ 48 , 50 , 51 ] . Invivo the default differentiation pathway of SVZ stem cells is to neurons . Oligodendrocyte differentiation is not preferred , but can be stimulated after injury and when remyelination is required [ 52 ] . Here we demonstrate in vitro that substrate stiffness can also stimulate oligodendrocyte differentiation . This differentiation response could be clinically advantageous , offering cell based treatments for the repair of brain and spinal cord injuries as well as in addressing myelin disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis . Already implantation in spinal cord injured rats of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells ( OPCs ) , induced from human embryonic stem cells , has demonstrated enhanced remyelination and partial restoration of locomotion [ 53 ] . Importantly , these signiﬁcant results are being pursued in a clinical trial . OnMACsurfaceswithmoduliof < 1 – 7 kPa , NSPCproliferationand colony formation were the preliminary cell responses that initiated cell differentiation . Substrate stiffness was inﬂuential in guiding colony formation as well as differentiation ( Fig . 6 ) . It is important to highlight that the inﬂuence of substrate stiffness on NSPC prolifera - tion and differentiation is likely greatest at the beginning of the cultureperiod , whenmostcellsdirectlyinteract withthe surfaceand before large colonies have formed . The stiffness of the matrix orchestrates the selection of certain progenitor populations , encouraging their proliferation and eventual differentiation . During latertimepointsthestiffnessofthesubstratewasshowntoinﬂuence the presence of differentiated neurons on the surface , away from colonies and only on < 1 kPa surfaces ( Fig . 6B ) . Substrates with E Y between < 1 and 7 primarily stimulated the proliferation of oligo - dendrocytes and neuron progenitors which resided in the growing colonies . The majority of the observed proliferation can likely be attributed to progenitors , since neurosphere culture in proliferation media has demonstrated that uncommitted neural stem cells make uplessthan1 % ofthetotalpopulation [ 54 ] . Duringthecourseofthe8 dculture period , this poolof progenitors decreasedoverall , as shown by down regulation of nestin mRNA expression ( Fig . 9A ) . The pres - ence of nestin positive cells was conﬁrmed with IHC at day 8 , yet nestin positive cells were present at low frequencies and only in colonies ( data not shown ) . Colonies maintained expression of the transcriptional factor and neuronal progenitor speciﬁc marker PAX6 Fig . 9 .

Shoichet / Biomaterials 30 ( 2009 ) 6867 – 6878 6876 on < 1 and 3 . 5 kPa surfaces for 4 d before turning off expression , conﬁrming neuronal maturation . PAX6 has been previously tied to neural stem / early progenitor cells that ﬁrst differentiate into GFAP positive radial glia followed by neurons [ 34 , 35 ] . Interestingly , we observed that the down regulation of PAX6 mRNA levels ( Fig . 9C ) corresponded with theup - regulation of both S100B and GFAP mRNA levels ( Fig . 9A ) as well as the appearance of GFAP - positive immu - nostained cells ( Fig . 6C ) . MAC offers a biomaterial based culture system which can be utilized to study and tune microenvironmental cues in order to more precisely guide stem cell behavior . Future work will focus on 3D responses to niche cues both in vitro and in vivo , which is possible with photopolymerizable MAC . Similar methodologies have been utilized for encapsulating live cells in methacrylate poly ( ethylene glycol ) hydrogels including studies with embryonic NSPCs [ 55 ] . A tunable photocrosslinkable material such as MAC facilitates the study of the combined actions of substrate stiffness , adhesive ligands , growth factor signals and co - culture with other cell types . Such a system may allow spatial control of cell differ - entiation , protein synthesis and the creation of tissue structures to replace diseased or damaged tissues in the nervous system . 5 . Conclusions Adult stem cells reside in unique niches , providing the cues necessary to guide proliferation and differentiation . This work demonstrates that photopolymerizable MAC can be utilized to study the contribution of substrate stiffness to NSPC behavior while also providing cells with similar soluble and adhesive cues to those found in the native NSPC niche . We have demonstrated that an optimal stiffness exists for both proliferation ( 3 . 5 kPa ) as well as differentiation to neurons ( < 1 kPa ) . Oligodendrocyte and astrocyte differentiation are closely tied to proliferation and colony forma - tion as well as the presence of neurons . The results of this study are important for the creation of biomaterials targeted towards CNS regeneration as well for understanding the basic principles inﬂu - encing stem cell behavior and function .
