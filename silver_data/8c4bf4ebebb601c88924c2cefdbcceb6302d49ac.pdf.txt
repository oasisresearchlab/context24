In this study of the cellular effects of Drf1 gene knock - Drf1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) cell lines 2B1 and 2D6 did not express Drf1 protein . All three heterozygous Drf1 (cid:1) / (cid:2) cell lines had out , we found that , in comparison to Drf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) and one Drf1 (cid:1) / (cid:2) cell line , several Drf1 - deficient cell lines had diminished Drf1 protein levels . These results confirmed that we had correctly targeted the Drf1 gene . However , elevated Drf3 levels . Not surprisingly , these cell lines not only had increased actin stress fibers , reflecting when we compared these cells to wild - type Drf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) cells ( CJ7 ) or NIH 3T3 cells , we found altered levels of Drf3 utilization as a RhoA effector , but also contained increased cortical F - actin and filopodia . These results p134 Drf3 . In both Drf1 null cell lines and one of the (cid:1) / (cid:2) lines ( 2E5 ) , we found increased expression of Drf3 , led us to examine whether Drf3 was actually an effector for Cdc42 , which we previously demonstrated could presumably due to cellular compensation for Drf1 loss .

When we visualized F - actin , it was clear to produce cells from embryoid bodies ( EBs ) . that many of the puncta were at the edges of growing Drf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) , (cid:1) / (cid:2) , and (cid:2) / (cid:2) ES cells were plated onto Petri lamella ( bottom row ) or at the center of small stellate dishes and maintained in in vitro differentiation medium F - actin arrays ( top row ) .

We examined binding by two - hybrid analysis ; a We then examined in detail the role of the Cdc42 interac - tion with Drf3 in cells . yeast reporter strain was cotransformed with the indi - cated plasmids for “bait” Gal4 - DNA binding or “prey” activation domain fusion proteins .

Successfully transformed colonies were restreaked and tested for growth on selective me - terphase cells , mitotic spindles , midbodies , and cleav - age furrows of dividing cells [ 3 , 4 , 33 ] . First , we wished dia supplemented with 3 - aminotriazole to increase the requirement for expression of the HIS4 reporter gene to determine if activated Cdc42 alone , or in conjunction with interfering Rac , would alter localization of an EGFP - [ 13 ] . The results are shown in Figure 3B : we found that the H160D substitution disrupted the ability of Cdc42 Drf3 fusion protein during filopodia formation . Figure 4A shows activated Cdc42 - V12 coexpression with EGFP - to bind to the GBD . However , the ability to interact with RhoA or DAD was unaffected . These results suggested Drf3 in NIH 3T3 cells .

A and EFYP ( red ) have been false colored . Consistent with the observations made with untagged Cdc42 - V12 and diagrammatic representation of the FRET probes that shows ECFP - Cdc42 activating EYFP - Drf3 is provided in EGFP ( Figure 4C ) , there was a small enhancement of Current Biology 538 localized with anti - (cid:4) - tubulin antibodies ( data not shown ) . The centrosomal localization appears to be de - pendent upon the FH2 domain , which is sufficient to target fluorescent proteins to the organelle ( B . J . W . and A . S . A . , unpublished data ) . The significance of this colo - calization is not clear . It may , however , suggest a role for Cdc42 and Drf3 in regulating microtubule dynamics at the MTOC . We then turned to the FRET technique to ascertain whether Cdc42 - V12 and Drf3 could interact within the cell . The results are shown in Figure 5B . In cells express - ingECFP - Cdc42 - V12andeitherEYFP ( toprow ) orEYFP - (cid:5) GBD - Drf3 ( data not shown ) , no significant FRET was observed . In contrast , as shown in two examples ( sec - ond and third rows ) , cells expressing ECFP - Cdc42 - V12 and EYFP - Drf3 generated a FRET signal along the cell cortex and at discrete regions corresponding to the MTOC ( indicated by arrowheads ) .

That is , the interaction tivated Cdc42 . The data suggest that one effect of EGFP - DAD , in addition to disrupting autoinhibition , is of Drf3 with Cdc42 and the disruption of autoinhibition . After activation , targeting to the filopodia may no longer to interfere with Cdc42 - V12’s recognition of the GTPase binding domain .

However , because the mation caused by activated Cdc42 . intramolecular interaction with DAD is intact [ 13 ] , Drf3 H160D remains autoinhibited and therefore cannot be Discussion activated and recruited by Cdc42 . Perhaps (cid:5) GBD - Drf3 becomes targeted to the tips of While studying the effects of genetic disruption of the the filopodia by other functional domains that bind to Drf1 gene in cells , we have identified a role for Drf3 as elongating actin filaments ( see below ) . We predict that an effector for Cdc42 during cytoskeletal remodeling . other FH domains , and / or their binding partners , partici - The data suggest that , in addition to activating Drfs by pate in the subsequent postactivation targeting of the disrupting autoinhibition [ 12 , 13 ] , the small GTPase also active scaffold .

As we have shown here , endogenous Drf3 also decorates microtubules , a result consistent with previous observa - Cdc42 - Directed Drf3 Signaling to Actin Remodeling tions made with EGFP - Drf3 [ 15 ] . Like other Drf family members , Drf3 is autoregulated via the interaction be - Filopodia are composed of bundles of actin filaments oriented with their barbed ends at the tip [ 44 ] . Studies tween its N - terminal GTPase binding domain and the Dia - autoregulatory domain ( DAD ) in its C terminus [ 12 , using various optical techniques have demonstrated that filopodia are assembled and extended at the tip by 13 ] . Until now , it has not been possible to determine which of these pools contain “active” Drf protein bound elongation ofthe actinfilaments [ 18 , 45 ] . Closeexamina - tion of filopodia dynamics led Mallavarapu and Mitchi - to small GTPases . Based on the hypothesis that Cdc42 might utilize Drf3 son to conclude that filopodia assembly relies upon the regulation of filament elongation rather than nucleation as an effector in Drf1 - deficient cells , we have observed Cdc42 interacting with Drf3 at sites of microspike forma - [ 18 ] . For the yeast Drf , Bni1p , recent studies by both Pruyne et al . [ 41 ] and Sagot et al . [ 40 ] suggested that tion and at the leading edge of migrating cells . This appears to be specific for the Cdc42 interaction with the combined FH1 - FH2 regions from Bni1p can nucleate actinfilamentsinvitroandpromotegrowthatthebarbed Drf3 ; in preliminary studies , we have found that other small GTPases interact with Drf3 at diverse sites . For end . Mammalian FH proteins appear to have the same activity ( H . Higgs , personal communication ) . Other stud - example , RhoB interacts with Drf3 on endosomes ( B . J . W . and A . S .

We have also ies of the FH1 - FH2 region derived from yeast Cdc12p indicate that FH proteins may function as barbed - end made two apparently conflicting observations : First , we found that the GTPase binding domain does not contrib - cappingproteins ( D .

Capping proteins can nucleate actin and ute to the targeting of Drf3 to the cell cortex , since GTPase binding - defective ( (cid:5) GBD ) Drf3 still colocalized protect the barbed end from monomer loss and further elongation and can thus promote the addition of actin with activated Cdc42 - V12 at the base of microspikes . Second , we found that targeting of the CRIB - disupted monomers at the pointed end [ 46 ] . Our model ( Figure 7 ) illustrates both possibilities , as it is not clear whether H160D variant to the cell cortex was impaired . This latter result suggested that Cdc42 binding to the GBD does Drf3 will behave exactly like either Bni1p or Cdc12p . Also , since these studies used subfragments of these participate in the recruitment of the Drf to the site of actin remodeling . The paradox created by these results two FH proteins , it is not known if regions outside the Cdc42 and Diaphanous - Related Formins 543 Figure 7 . Drf3 Activation at the Cell Cortex ( 1 ) Cdc42 binding to the GBD disrupts the autoregulatory interaction with DAD [ 13 ] , and ( 2 ) the GTPase - Drf3 complex becomes recruited to the cell cortex . ( 3 ) The activated Drf3 alone , or in collaboration with its binding partners , is then predicted to nucleate actin [ 40 , 41 ] . ( 4 ) Filopodia extension then results from elongation of actin filaments caused by the addition of actin subunits at the barbed end . It is not known if any of the Drf3 binding partners , indicated by the double - headed arrows , participate in the activation , recruitment , nucleation , and / or elongation steps . These include Src [ 4 ] , IRSp53 [ 26 , 28 ] , and DIP / WISH [ 43 , 50 ] , which potentially bridge WASP / Scar proteins [ 24 ] or Ena / VASP proteins [ 27 ] to the Drfs during actin remodeling .
