Chen Department of Bioengineering , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA 19104 ABSTRACT The transforming growth factor - β ( TGF - β ) signaling pathway is often misregulat - ed during cancer progression . In early stages of tumorigenesis , TGF - β acts as a tumor sup - pressor by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis . However , as the disease progress - es , TGF - β switches to promote tumorigenic cell functions , such as epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and increased cell motility . Dramatic changes in the cellular microenviron - ment are also correlated with tumor progression , including an increase in tissue stiffness . However , it is unknown whether these changes in tissue stiffness can regulate the effects of TGF - β . To this end , we examined normal murine mammary gland cells and Madin – Darby ca - nine kidney epithelial cells cultured on polyacrylamide gels with varying rigidity and treated with TGF - β 1 . Varying matrix rigidity switched the functional response to TGF - β 1 . Decreasing rigidity increased TGF - β 1 – induced apoptosis , whereas increasing rigidity resulted in EMT . Matrix rigidity did not change Smad signaling , but instead regulated the PI3K / Akt signaling pathway . Direct genetic and pharmacologic manipulations further demonstrated a role for PI3K / Akt signaling in the apoptotic and EMT responses . These findings demonstrate that matrix rigidity regulates a previously undescribed switch in TGF - β – induced cell functions and provide insight into how changes in tissue mechanics during disease might contribute to the cellular response to TGF - β . INTRODUCTION Transforming growth factor - β ( TGF - β ) is a pleiotropic cytokine es - sential for many physiological processes , including embryonic de - velopment , immune function , and wound healing ( Wu and Hill , 2009 ) . Misregulation of TGF - β signaling can contribute to the pro - gression of disease states such as organ fibrosis and cancer , and a key to treating these diseases will be a better understanding of the TGF - β signal transduction machinery ( Massague , 2008 ) . However , due to its widespread effects , the role of TGF - β is not well under - stood . This is perhaps best illustrated in the context of tumor pro - gression , although analogous situations can be found in other set - tings . During early stages of tumorigenesis , TGF - β acts as a tumor suppressor . TGF - β induces growth arrest and apoptosis in most nor - mal epithelial cells in vitro ( Pietenpol et al . , 1990 ; Hannon and Beach , 1994 ; Siegel and Massague , 2003 ) . Mice in which the TGFB1 or SMAD genes are disrupted are prone to the development of can - cer ( Zhu et al . , 1998 ; Engle et al . , 1999 ; Go et al . , 1999 ) . Retrospec - tive studies of various human tumor types have also found frequent down - regulation or mutations inactivating the TGF - β signaling path - way ( Kaklamani et al . , 2005 ; Stuelten et al . , 2006 ; Bacman et al . , 2007 ) . In later stages of cancer progression , however , TGF - β is be - lieved to switch roles and promote tumor progression and metasta - sis ( Derynck et al . , 2001 ; Wakefield and Roberts , 2002 ; Tang et al . , 2003 ) . Within the tumor , TGF - β enhances migration , invasion , sur - vival , and epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) ( Massague , 2008 ) . High levels of TGF - β in clinical settings are associated with a poor prognosis ( Friess et al . , 1993 ; Wikstrom et al . , 1998 ; Fukai et al . , 2003 ) , and treatment with TGF - β in animal models results in larger , more metastatic tumors ( Wikstrom et al . , 1998 ; Fukai et al . , 2003 ; Muraoka et al . , 2003 ) . TGF - β also plays an active role in Monitoring Editor Yu - Li Wang Carnegie Mellon University Received : Jun 20 , 2011 Revised : Nov 29 , 2011 Accepted : Jan 5 , 2012 This article was published online ahead of print in MBoC in Press ( http : / / www . molbiolcell . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1091 / mbc .

L . Leight et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 60 kPa and then treated with TGF - β 1 . NMuMG cells cultured on PA gels exhibited differences in morphology as a function of substrate compliance ( Figure 1A ) . Cells on the most rigid gels ( E > 14 kPa ) appeared cuboidal and formed a monolayer on the surface identical to cells on tissue culture plastic . In contrast , cells on compliant gels ( E < 1 kPa ) were rounded and formed spherical clusters . On rigid PA gels ( E > 5 kPa ) or on tissue culture plastic , TGF - β 1 treatment in - duced an elongated morphology and scattering of cells , character - istic of an EMT ( Figure 1A ) . Examination of known EMT markers confirmed this response , as evidenced by delocalization of the epi - thelial junctional markers zonula occludens - 1 ( ZO - 1 ) and E - cadherin and increased expression of mesenchymal markers N - cadherin , α - smooth muscle actin ( α - SMA ) , and the EMT - associated transcription factor Snail ( Figure 1 , B , C , and E ) . Although E - cadherin was dis - placed from adherens junctions , no significant decrease was ob - served in E - cadherin protein expression , similar to observations from other groups using the NMuMG cell line ( Figure 1B ; Bakin et al . , 2000 ; Shintani et al . , 2006 ; Bailey and Liu , 2008 ) . Although TGF - β 1 did not appear to induce EMT on compliant gels , as indi - cated by decreased N - cadherin , α - SMA , and Snail expression as compared with rigid gels , phase and immunofluorescence imaging revealed a dramatic increase in TGF - β 1 – induced apoptosis on com - pliant gels ( Figure 1 , A and D , and Supplemental Figure S1B ) . Apop - tosis was confirmed by nuclear fragmentation and caspase activity ( Figure 1 , D and E ) . On compliant gels , ∼ 28 % of cells were positive for cleaved caspase - 3 by immunofluorescence after 24 h of TGF - β 1 treatment , whereas 13 % of cells were positive on rigid gels ( Supple - mental Figure S1C ) . Increased apoptosis on compliant gels was ob - served across three orders of magnitude of TGF - β 1 concentration , from 0 . 1 to 10 ng / ml ( Supplemental Figure S1D ) . TGF - β 1 treatment was necessary for the observed increase in apoptosis , as basal levels of apoptosis were similar across substrates of different stiffness ( Figure 1 , D and E , and Supplemental Figure S1C ) . On substrates with modulus ranging from 1 to 8 kPa , there was a decrease in apop - tosis , as well as a concomitant increase in Snail expression ( Figure 1E ) ; this range of modulus is also associated with measurements of excised tumor tissue ( Paszek et al . , 2005 ) . Snail , a transcription factor induced by TGF - β and responsible for the down - regulation of E - cadherin , is a critical factor regulating EMT and was used here as an early marker of EMT , as the rapid onset of apoptosis on compliant gels prevented reliable measurement of later - stage markers ( Sup - plemental Figure S1 , A and B ; Cano et al . , 2000 ; Peinado et al . , 2003 ; Cho et al . , 2007 ) . These data suggest that matrix rigidity regu - lates a functional switch between apoptosis and EMT in response to TGF - β 1 . A similar switch in cell fate between apoptosis and EMT was also observed in MDCK epithelial cells , suggesting that this control mechanism is not restricted to mammary epithelia . MDCK cells cul - tured on rigid gels underwent a classic EMT with TGF - β 1 treatment , as indicated by an elongated morphology , actin stress fibers , and delocalization of the epithelial cell – cell adhesion markers E - cadherin and ZO - 1 ( Figure 2A ) . Compliant substrates , conversely , inhibited this transition , and MDCK cells retained a rounded morphology , cor - tical actin , and epithelial adherens and tight junctions with TGF - β 1 treatment . Similar to the NMuMGs , increased apoptosis was also ob - served in MDCK cells cultured on compliant substrates ( Figure 2B ) . ECM proteins promote cell adhesion but also provide biochemi - cal and biophysical cues that can regulate cell function and signaling ( Hynes , 2009 ) . Thus it was not clear whether the rigidity - regulated switch between EMT and apoptosis was specific to the fibronectin ( FN ) conjugated to the PA gels or occurred irrespective of the ECM protein to which cells attached . To address this question , NMuMG remodeling of the tumor microenvironment , promoting activation of fibroblasts , increasing angiogenesis , and suppressing immune sur - veillance ( Bierie and Moses , 2006 ) . Although the switch in TGF - β from a tumor suppressor to promoter during disease progression is well documented , it is still unclear how this switch occurs . One pos - sibility is that changes in the cellular microenvironmental context guide the cellular response to TGF - β . Although many aspects of the cellular microenvironment change during disease , including soluble factors , cell – cell interactions , and cell – extracellular matrix ( ECM ) adhesion , changes in the mechanical properties of the microenvironment may also modulate the response to the TGF - β . The mechanical stiffness of tissue microenvironments varies widely , as adipose tissue is less rigid than muscle , which is less rigid than bone , and tissue stiffness can also change within the same type of tissue during disease states ( Butcher et al . , 2009 ) . In the context of cancer progression , as well as tissue fibrosis , increased tissue stiffness is well documented and is due to a number of fac - tors , including extracellular matrix remodeling , deposition , and cross - linking ( Ebihara et al . , 2000 ; Levental et al . , 2009 ) . Several re - cent studies have shown that such changes in matrix rigidity can regulate many cellular functions , including focal adhesion matura - tion , cell spreading , actin stress fiber formation , and cell motility ( Pelham and Wang , 1997 ; Lo et al . , 2000 ; Yeung et al . , 2005 ) . Sev - eral cell types cultured on compliant substrates decrease prolifera - tion and increase apoptosis as compared with cells on rigid sub - strates ( Wang et al . , 2000 ; Klein et al . , 2009 ; Tilghman et al . , 2010 ; Mih et al . , 2011 ) . Differentiation of many cell types can also be regu - lated by matrix rigidity , including human mesenchymal stem cells , portal fibroblasts , mammary epithelial cells , and endothelial cells ( Vailhe et al . , 1997 ; Paszek et al . , 2005 ; Engler et al . , 2006 ; Li et al . , 2007 ; Alcaraz et al . , 2008 ) . Because matrix rigidity can regulate a number of cell functions also regulated by TGF - β , such as prolifera - tion , apoptosis , and differentiation , and tissues become stiffer dur - ing disease progression , we hypothesized that changes in matrix ri - gidity could regulate TGF - β – induced cellular functions . In this study , we examined whether matrix rigidity regulates TGF - β – induced cell function . We examined two cell functions—apoptosis and EMT—as representative responses to TGF - β classically associ - ated with tumor suppression or promotion , respectively ( Massague , 2008 ) . In most nontransformed epithelial cells , TGF - β induces pro - grammed cell death , or apoptosis ; this is one way TGF - β suppresses tumorigenesis during early stages of the disease ( Rahimi and Leof , 2007 ) . In contrast , EMT is a key step during metastasis , which occurs during later stages of disease , and is characterized by dissolution of epithelial cell – cell junctions , remodeling of cell – matrix adhesion , and increased motility ( Lee et al . , 2006 ) . In studies presented here , we found a novel PI3K / Akt - mediated switch in which substrate rigid - ity controlled TGF - β 1 – induced cell functions—epithelial cells cul - tured on compliant substrates underwent apoptosis when treated with TGF - β 1 , whereas on more rigid substrates , TGF - β 1 induced EMT . These findings suggest that matrix mechanics plays a key role in regulating the opposing functional effects of TGF - β 1 . RESULTS Matrix rigidity regulates TGF - β 1 – induced cell fate To explore whether matrix rigidity influences cellular responses to TGF - β 1 in a noncancerous genetic background , we used normal murine mammary gland epithelial cells ( NMuMG ) and Madin – Darby canine kidney epithelial cells ( MDCK ) , both well established in vitro model systems of EMT ( Miettinen et al . , 1994 ) . We first examined NMuMG cells that were cultured on fibronectin - conjugated poly - acrylamide ( PA ) gels with a range of elastic modulus ( E ) from 0 . 4 to Volume 23 March 1 , 2012 Matrix rigidity regulates apoptosis – EMT switch | 783 FN or rBM also increased TGF - β 1 – induced apoptosis ( Figure 3C ) . However , cells cultured on coll I substrates had dramatically reduced levels of caspase - 3 activity in all conditions , although increased compliance still enhanced levels of apoptosis . Because cell spread - ing can regulate apoptosis and coll I increased cell spreading on compliant substrates , it was unclear whether the decrease in apop - tosis was due to increased cell spreading or more specifically to coll I signaling ( Chen et al . , 1997 ) . To address this question , each cells were cultured on polyacrylamide gels conjugated with FN , re - constituted basement membrane ( rBM ; commercially known as Matrigel ) , or collagen I ( coll I ) and treated with TGF - β 1 . NMuMGs cultured on substrates conjugated with FN or rBM were morpho - logically similar ; however on coll I substrates , cell spreading was in - creased ( Figure 3A ) . Substrate compliance inhibited TGF - β 1 – induced EMT regardless of ECM type , as indicated by decreased Snail expression ( Figure 3B ) .

L . Leight et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell not clear whether the decreased EMT on compliant gels was a result of TGF - β 1 – induced cell death or compliance directly regulated EMT independent of its effects on cell survival . To address this , we blocked the apoptotic response by either overexpress - ing the survival factor , Bcl - xL , or treating with a pan - caspase inhibitor , ZVAD - FMK , and observed whether EMT on compliant gels would be rescued ( Boise et al . , 1993 ) . As a control , both reagents decreased cas - pase - 3 activity and prevented nuclear frag - mentation ( Supplemental Figure S2 ) . When apoptosis was inhibited , NMuMGs cultured on compliant gels still failed to undergo EMT . E - cadherin remained localized to junc - tions , N - cadherin and α - SMA failed to ex - press , and cells did not transition to an elon - gated phenotype ( Figure 4 , A and B ) . Together these data suggest that substrate stiffness regulates a switch in the response of cells to TGF - β 1 between EMT and apop - tosis and that these two responses are inde - pendently regulated . Previous studies showed that cell density can regulate TGF - β – induced cell functions and that cells grown to confluence do not undergo EMT ( Petridou et al . , 2000 ; Nelson et al . , 2008 ) . Specifically , less TGF - β bound to TGF - β receptors and Smad translocation was reduced in confluent cells ( Petridou et al . , 2000 ) . To investigate whether matrix rigidity regulates TGF - β signaling through a similar mechanism , NMuMGs were plated at 60 % confluence ( 1 × 10 5 cells / cm 2 ) and treated with TGF - β 1 . As early as 2 h after TGF - β 1 treatment , Smad4 translocated to the nucleus in NMuMGs to similar degrees on both rigid and compliant substrates ( Figure 5A ) . Furthermore , use of a Smad - re - sponsive 3TP - luciferase reporter plasmid also showed no difference in Smad tran - scriptional activity on rigid versus compliant substrates ( Figure 5B ; Wrana et al . , 1992 ; Yingling et al . , 1997 ) . Together these results suggest that TGF - β receptor / Smad signal - ing functions at similar levels on compliant and rigid substrates and is not responsible for the matrix rigidity – induced switch in TGF - β function . Matrix rigidity could modulate TGF - β 1 signaling at numerous levels in addition to the Smad signaling pathway . Previous work showed that increased matrix rigidity and treatment with TGF - β 1 each can promote actin stress fiber and focal adhesion formation ( Pelham and Wang , 1997 ; Yeung et al . , 2005 ) . Similar stress fiber and focal adhesion responses are seen upon treatment with TGF - β 1 ( Miettinen et al . , 1994 ; Edlund et al . , 2002 ) . In addition , focal adhe - sion kinase ( FAK ) , one of the main signaling components within focal adhesions , can also be regulated by matrix rigidity and TGF - β 1 and is associated with cell survival and EMT ( Ilic et al . , 1998 ; Wang et al . , 2004 ; Paszek et al . , 2005 ; Cicchini et al . , 2008 ; Zouq et al . , 2009 ) . To investigate whether FAK may be involved in this system , we first ECM was microcontact printed onto polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) – coated coverslips to restrict cell spreading ( area of 289 μm 2 ) or to allow cells to fully spread ( Figure 3D ) . Restricting cell spreading , similar to compliant substrates , increased TGF - β 1 – induced apopto - sis compared with fully spread cells for all ECM types ( Figure 3D ) . Whereas increased apoptosis was observed in unspread cells on coll I substrates as compared with fully spread cells , apoptosis on coll I substrates was significantly less than for cells cultured on FN or rBM , suggesting that coll I specifically inhibits apoptosis on compli - ant substrates in addition to regulating cell spreading . Given that the apoptotic response occurred within hours , whereas a full EMT required at least 48 h of TGF - β 1 treatment , it was FIGurE 2 : TGF - β 1 – induced EMT and apoptosis in MDCK cells cultured on polyacrylamide gels .

Prominent focal adhesions , as indicated by punctate immunofluorescence staining for vinculin , and actin stress fibers were observed in NMuMGs cul - tured on rigid substrates ( Figure 6A ) . On compliant substrates , focal adhesion markers were diffuse , and cortical actin was observed ( Figure 6B ) . Treatment with TGF - β 1 qualitatively increased focal ad - hesion size on rigid substrates , but no effect was observed on com - pliant gels . We also observed increased phospho - FAK localization to focal adhesions in a manner that directly correlated with vinculin FIGurE 3 : TGF - β 1 – induced EMT and apoptosis in NMuMG cells cultured on polyacrylamide gels conjugated with ECM .

Western blot analysis confirmed this obser - vation , showing increased levels of phospho - FAK ( Figure 6C ) . How - ever , specific activity of FAK ( phospho - FAK normalized to total FAK ) showed no significant difference between compliant and rigid gels , as FAK protein levels were greatly decreased on compliant gels . In a recent study , FAK protein expression was found to be critical for the mesenchymal phenotype and Snail expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts , so we hypothesized that overexpressing FAK in cells on compliant gels may rescue Snail expression and EMT ( Li et al . , 2011 ) . To test this possibility , we overexpressed FAK using an adenoviral vector ( Supplemental Figure S3A ) . Overexpression of FAK did not rescue Snail mRNA expression on compliant gels ; however a de - crease in apoptosis was observed ( Figure 6 , D and E ) . Previous re - ports showed decreased FAK expression on collagen gels due to FAK degradation by calpain ( Wang et al . , 2003 ) . In this system , how - ever , we did not observe lower – molecular weight bands associated with FAK degradation by Western blot , and treatment with a calpain inhibitor , ALLN , did not increase FAK expression or inhibit apoptosis on compliant gels ( data not shown ) . Whereas overexpression of wild - type FAK rescued cell survival on compliant gels , expression of CD2 - FAK , an activated FAK allele ( Frisch et al . , 1996 ) , failed to inhibit apoptosis on compliant gels ( Supplemental Figure S3E ) . Further supporting these data , pharma - cological inhibition of FAK activity with the small - molecule inhibitor PF 573228 reduced Y397 FAK phosphorylation but did not affect EMT or apoptosis ( Supplemental Figure S3 , B and C ) . Expression of the dominant - negative FRNK and the phosphorylation mutant FAK Y397F , both at physiological levels and highly overexpressed , did not reduce FAK phosphorylation at Y397 and did not affect EMT or apoptosis ( Supplemental Figure S3E ) . These data suggest that ma - trix rigidity is regulating FAK signaling by modulating FAK protein levels and that FAK levels in turn regulate compliance - induced apoptosis but not EMT . Other important regulators of stress fiber and focal adhesion formation , the RhoGTPases , were also investi - gated using the pharmacological inhibitors Y27632—a ROCK ( Rho kinase ) inhibitor—and NSC 23766—a Rac1 inhibitor . Neither inhibi - tor significantly affected apoptosis or EMT on compliant or rigid gels ( Supplemental Figure S4 , A and B ) . Matrix rigidity regulates apoptosis and EMT through PI3K and Akt Similar to FAK , the PI3K / Akt pathway has been shown to regulate both EMT and survival in a variety of settings and can be regulated by matrix stiffness ( Chen et al . , 1998 ; Bakin et al . , 2000 ; Levental et al . , 2009 ) . To investigate whether substrate rigidity regulates the PI3K / Akt signaling pathway , we first measured Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 . Because insulin is an essential component of the growth media of NMuMGs and insulin is known to stimulate Akt activity , exposure to insulin was included as a background control ( Burgering and Coffer , 1995 ) . In all cases , NMuMGs cultured on compliant gels showed decreased Akt activation compared with cells on rigid gels ( Figure 7A ) . Inhibition of PI3K or Akt activity with pharmacological inhibitors LY294002 and two Akt inhibitors in - creased TGF - β 1 – induced apoptosis ( Figure 7 , B and C ) . Inhibition of PI3K decreased Snail mRNA expression on rigid gels ; however , inhi - bition of Akt did not ( Figure 7D ) . Although these studies suggest that PI3K is necessary for survival and EMT following TGF - β 1 treat - ment , it was not clear whether it was also sufficient . We increased PI3K activity by adenoviral expression of p110 - CAAX , a membrane - localized subunit of PI3K , and observed suppression of apoptosis on compliant gels to similar levels observed on rigid gels ( Figure 7 , E and F ) . p110 - CAAX expression , however , did not rescue Snail mRNA 786 | J . L . Leight et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1997 ) and EMT ( Bakin et al . , 2000 ; Kattla et al . , 2008 ) . Although we found inhibition of Akt activity by two pharmacological in - hibitors increased apoptosis on rigid sub - strates , EMT was unaffected . This could be explained by demonstration of distinct reg - ulatory roles for the Akt isoforms ( Irie et al . , 2005 ) , and here pharmacological inhibition would not differentiate between the iso - forms . It is perhaps not surprising that up - regulation of PI3K failed to rescue EMT on low - rigidity substrates . Given the many dis - parate processes that are necessary to drive EMT , it is likely that additional points of reg - ulation are affected by rigidity ( Cannito et al . , 2010 ) . In mesenchymal cells ( as op - posed to epithelial cells ) , one component of EMT has been reported to exhibit remnants of this control mechanism . TGF - β – induced smooth muscle actin expression in fibro - blasts and trabecular meshwork cells ( asso - ciated with myofibroblast differentiation ) appears to be suppressed with decreased matrix rigidity ( Arora et al . , 1999 ; Li et al . , 2007 ; Chen et al . , 2011 ; Han et al . , 2011 ) . Moreover , inhibitors of PI3K / Akt signaling can block α - SMA expression ( Han et al . , 2011 ) . Although it would be inappropriate to suggest that mechanical regulation of EMT is equivalent to α - SMA expression , since EMT involves many additional regula - tory steps , including loss of epithelial mark - ers , cell – cell adhesions , and polarity , these studies do suggest some conserved mecha - nisms . More starkly , the stiffness - induced switch between apoptosis and EMT that we report here in two epithelial cell systems is absent in fibroblastic cells , suggesting a new function of matrix rigidity to regulate a switch between TGF - β – induced functions . Further elucidation of these mechanisms is likely forthcoming , as recent studies are beginning to uncover the wide array of sig - naling pathways affected by rigidity , includ - ing integrin activation , focal adhesion as - sembly , and numerous signaling pathways , including Rho GTPases , mitogen - activated protein kinases , FAK , and phosphoinosit - ide kinase - 3 ( Fringer and Grinnell , 2001 ; Wozniak et al . , 2003 ; Paszek et al . , 2005 ; Friedland et al . , 2009 ; Klein et al . , 2009 ; Levental et al . , 2009 ) . The results presented here also highlight the complex interplay among matrix rigidity , cell spreading , and ECM subtypes . Here we found that TGF - β – induced EMT is inhibited on compliant substrates independent of ECM subtypes , but that the compliance - induced apoptosis was more dramatic when cells en - gaged FN or rBM as compared with coll I . Of interest , we observed that cell spreading was enhanced on coll I , and it was previously re - ported that cell spreading can antagonize apoptosis ( Chen et al . , 1997 ) . Indeed , the coll I – induced reduction in apoptosis appears to be due in part to the increased cell spreading , since controlling cell expression ( Figure 7G ) . Together these data demonstrate a role for PI3K and Akt in transducing substrate compliance and regulating the compliance - induced switch in cellular response to TGF - β 1 . DISCUSSION We find that decreasing matrix rigidity inhibits PI3K / Akt activity and through this action impinges on both survival and EMT . Numerous previous studies demonstrated the importance of the PI3K / Akt sig - naling pathways for cell survival ( Dudek et al . , 1997 ; Khwaja et al . , FIGurE 4 : Decreased matrix rigidity inhibits EMT independent of apoptosis .

Furthermore , these studies high - light the central role for matrix mechanics in regulating cell signaling and fate . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and reagents NMuMG and MDCK cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA ) and cultured according to their recommendations . Reagents were ob - tained as follows . Monoclonal antibodies : α - smooth muscle actin ( 1A4 ) , Smad4 ( DCS - 46 ) , and vinculin ( hVIN - 1 ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) ; glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ; 6C5 ; Applied Bio - systems / Ambion , Austin , TX ) ; and E - cad - herin ( 36 ) , N - cadherin ( 32 ) , and FAK ( 77 ; BD Biosciences , San Diego , CA ) . Polyclonal an - tibodies : ZO - 1 ( Zymed Laboratories , San Francisco , CA ) ; pY397 FAK ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) ; and pAkt , Akt , Bcl - xL , cleaved caspase - 3 , and FAK ( Cell Signaling Technol - ogy , Beverly , MA ) . ECMs ( FN , coll I , and rBM ) , all from BD Biosciences . Cells were plated at a density of 0 . 1 × 10 6 cells / cm 2 on FN - functionalized poly - acrylamide gels for 16 h in growth medium . Compliant gels referred to in the text indi - cate gels with an elastic modulus of 0 . 4 kPa , and rigid gels have E > 5 kPa . The cells were rinsed in sterile phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and then growth factor starved in high - glucose DMEM for 2 h . Cells were treated with 10 μg / ml insulin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and 2 ng / ml TGF - β 1 ( R & D Sys - tems , Minneapolis , MN ) for 2 h ( RNA isolation , FAK , and Akt West - ern blotting ) , 4 h ( caspase activity , focal adhesion staining , luciferase assays ) , 24 h ( nuclei fragmentation , cleaved caspase - 3 staining ) , or 48 h ( for EMT staining and Western blotting ) . For inhibitor studies , cells were treated 1 h prior to TGF - β treatment with ZVAD - FMK ( 400 μM ; Enzo Life Sciences , Plymouth , PA ) , Y - 276322 ( 10 μM ) and PF 573228 ( 1 μM ; Tocris Biosciences , Ellisville , MO ) , and NSC 23766 ( 10 μM ) , LY294002 ( 10 μM ) , Akt Inhibitor VIII ( 1 μM ) , and Akt Inhibi - tor V ( 10 μM ) ( Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA ) . Polyacrylamide gel preparation Polyacrylamide gels were prepared as previously described ( Winer et al . , 2009 ) . Mechanical properties of the polyacrylamide gels were controlled by varying the percentage of acrylamide and bis - acrylam - ide as follows : elastic modulus ( % acrylamide ; % bis - acrylamide ) , 0 . 4 kPa ( 3 ; 0 . 05 ) , 1 kPa ( 3 ; 0 . 1 ) , 5 kPa ( 5 . 5 ; 0 . 15 ) , 8 kPa ( 5 ; 0 . 3 ) , 14 . 5 kPa ( 7 . 5 ; 0 . 15 ) , 20 kPa ( 8 ; 0 . 264 ) , and 60 kPa ( 10 ; 0 . 5 ) . Gels were function - alized with 20 μg / ml FN , 20 μg / ml coll I , or 140 μg / ml rBM in 50 mM 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid ( HEPES ) , pH 8 , for 1 h at room temperature ( RT ; 2 h on ice for rBM ) , rinsed in double - distilled H 2 O ( ddH 2 O ) , incubated with 1 % ( vol / vol ) ethanolamine in 50 mM HEPES , pH 8 , for 30 min , and rinsed with ddH 2 O . The gels were sterilized in 5 % ( vol / vol ) isopropanol in PBS for 1 h at RT and rinsed two times with sterile PBS before plating with cells . Preparation of micropatterned substrates Micropatterned substrates were prepared as described ( Pirone et al . , 2006 ) . Briefly , micropatterned stamps were fabricated by area through microcontact printing partially accounted for this dif - ference . However , coll I was still partially able to inhibit cell death even when cell spreading was restricted . Thus binding this ECM ap - pears to have an additional benefit , possibly through specific colla - gen receptors such as α 2 β 1 integrin or the discoidin domain recep - tors 1 / 2 ( Ongusaha et al . , 2003 ) . In other cell types , such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells , adhesion to coll I reduced cell spreading ( Yeung et al . , 2005 ) , and in a melanoma cell line coll I did not affect cell spreading but increased cell stiffness and adhesion strength ( Byfield et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , although there is a widely demonstrated link between substrate stiffness and cell spreading ( Pelham and Wang , 1997 ; Yeung et al . , 2005 ; Fu et al . , 2010 ) , how specific ECMs can impact this response may depend on the cell type . These results highlight that regulation of cell function by matrix rigidity can be affected by other cell – matrix adhesion inputs , such as cell spreading and ECM subtype . TGF - β regulates a diverse array of cellular functions , including proliferation , motility , and differentiation , and these effects are dis - tinct in many cell types . How TGF - β regulates often divergent func - tions even in a single cell type , particularly in disease contexts such as tumorigenesis , is not well understood . It has been reported that some cell types spontaneously undergo apoptosis on compliant substrates ( Wang et al . , 2000 , 2007 ) , but in the work presented here TGF - β was a required trigger for death . Here we found that on compliant substrates , with a modulus similar to that of native breast tissue , TGF - β induces apoptosis , whereas on rigid substrates , with a modulus similar to that of tumor or fibrotic tissue , TGF - β induces EMT . These results provide a possible explanation for the switch in TGF - β ’s action from tumor suppressor to promoter during tumori - FIGurE 5 : Smad signaling in NMuMG cells on compliant and rigid gels .
