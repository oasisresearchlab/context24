Martin Regulated endocytosis of (cid:1) - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionic acid - type glutamate receptors ( AMPARs ) is critical for synaptic plasticity . However , the speciﬁc combination of clathrin - dependent and - independent mechanisms that mediate AMPAR trafﬁcking in vivo have not been fully characterized . Here , we examine the trafﬁcking of the AMPAR subunit GLR - 1 in Caenorhabditis elegans . GLR - 1 is localized on synaptic membranes , where it regulates reversals of locomotion in a simple behavioral circuit . Animals lacking RAB - 10 , a small GTPase required for endocytic recycling of intestinal cargo , are similar in phenotype to animals lacking LIN - 10 , a postsynaptic density 95 / disc - large / zona occludens - domain containing protein : GLR - 1 accumulates in large accretions and animals display a decreased frequency of reversals . Mutations in unc - 11 ( AP180 ) or itsn - 1 ( Intersectin 1 ) , which reduce clathrin - dependent endocytosis , suppress the lin - 10 but not rab - 10 mutant phenotype , suggesting that LIN - 10 functions after clathrin - mediated endocytosis . By contrast , choles - terol depletion , which impairs lipid raft formation and clathrin - independent endocytosis , suppresses the rab - 10 but not the lin - 10 phenotype , suggesting that RAB - 10 functions after clathrin - independent endocytosis . Animals lacking both genes display additive GLR - 1 trafﬁcking defects . We propose that RAB - 10 and LIN - 10 recycle AMPARs from intracellular endosomal compartments to synapses along distinct pathways , each with distinct sensitivities to cholesterol and the clathrin - mediated endocytosis machinery . INTRODUCTION Continuous movement of (cid:1) - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionic acid ( AMPA ) - type glutamate receptors ( AMPARs ) into and out of synaptic membranes is a key mechanism for the regulation of excitatory synaptic strength . Previous work has shown that insertion of AMPARs into the plasma membrane strengthens synapses and that it is re - quired to convert silent synapses into active synapses ( Bredt and Nicoll , 2003 ; Malenka , 2003 ; Malinow , 2003 ; Sheng and Hyoung Lee , 2003 ; Gerges et al . , 2005 ) . Furthermore , it has recently been shown that recycling of AMPARs from inter - nal endosomal compartments back to the plasma membrane is important for long - term potentiation ( Park et al . , 2004 ) . By contrast , endocytosis of AMPARs at sites adjacent to the postsynaptic density is important for long - term depression ( Carroll et al . , 2001 ; Racz et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , molecular ma - chinery required for endocytosis , as well as intracellular membrane trafﬁcking processes , ultimately regulates the character of signal transmitted at each synapse . Multiple endocytosis trafﬁcking pathways have been ob - served in cells . Clathrin - dependent endocytosis occurs at clathrin - coated pits , where transmembrane protein cargo and adaptor molecules recruit soluble clathrin ( Le Roy and Wrana , 2005 ) . Vesicles coated with a clathrin lattice are then pinched off from the membrane . Members of the Rab family of small guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) ases mediate the in - tracellular membrane trafﬁcking of endocytosed vesicles to early endosomes , where they fuse and release their cargo ( Clague , 1998 ; Zerial and McBride , 2001 ) . Such clathrin - dependent endocytosis plays an important role in the regu - lated removal of AMPARs from the synapse , and it is reg - ulated by the small GTPase Rab5 ( Carroll et al . , 1999 ; Man et al . , 2000 ; Wang and Linden , 2000 ; Burbea et al . , 2002 ; Brown et al . , 2005 ) . Clathrin - independent endocytosis can also occur in cells . Clathrin - independent pathways proceed through choles - terol and sphingolipid - rich microdomains ( lipid rafts ) , and regulate the levels and activity of growth factor signaling molecules ( Johannes and Lamaze , 2002 ; Parton and Rich - ards , 2003 ; Kirkham and Parton , 2005 ; Le Roy and Wrana , 2005 ) . It is not clear whether AMPARs are endocytosed by clathrin - independent pathways , although lipid rafts have been observed in dendrites of cultured hippocampal neu - rons ( Hering et al . , 2003 ) . One factor that has been associated with clathrin - indepen - dent endocytosis is RAB - 10 , a broadly expressed Rab that directs protein trafﬁcking in polarized cells of both mam - mals and Caenorhabditis elegans ( Babbey et al . , 2006 ; Chen et al . , 2006 ) . Work done in the intestinal epithelial cells of C . elegans suggests that RAB - 10 mediates cargo recycling from early endosomes back to the basolateral membrane ( Chen et al . , 2006 ) . Mutants for rab - 10 fail to recycle transmembrane cargo , resulting in enlarged early endosomes . Cargo endo - cytosed by clathrin - independent endocytosis ( e . g . , the inter - leukin - 2 receptor ) are particularly dependent on RAB - 10 for recycling . Given the particularly strong requirement for RAB - 10 in regulating clathrin - independent cargo , RAB - 10 is This article was published online ahead of print in MBC in Press ( http : / / www . molbiolcell . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1091 / mbc .

AMPAR trafﬁcking and localization can be studied in the intact nervous system of the genetically tractable model organism C . elegans ( Rongo et al . , 1998 ) . The C . elegans ge - nome contains two AMPAR - type subunits : GLR - 1 and GLR - 2 ( Hart et al . , 1995 ; Maricq et al . , 1995 ; Brockie et al . , 2001a ) . Previously , we showed that ﬂuorescently tagged versions of GLR - 1 are functional and that they are localized to postsynaptic regions when expressed in nematodes ( Rongo et al . , 1998 ) . Furthermore , GLR - 1 is required at in - terneurons that are part of a simple sensory circuit regulat - ing backward movement , both in response to nose - touch stimulus and as part of the foraging behavior of animals . Mutants with depressed GLR - 1 synaptic levels are nose - touch defective and rarely reverse direction , whereas mu - tants with elevated synaptic levels reverse direction with increased frequency ( Hart et al . , 1995 ; Maricq et al . , 1995 ; Zheng et al . , 1999 ; Brockie et al . , 2001b ; Mellem et al . , 2002 ; Schaefer and Rongo , 2006 ) . Therefore , by observing the be - havior ( e . g . , nose - touch response and reversals per minute ) of animals with different genetic backgrounds , we can com - pare signal strength at this circuit , and we can infer the abundance of GLR - 1 AMPARs present at the postsynaptic plasma membrane . Like mammalian AMPARs , GLR - 1 synaptic abundance is regulated by clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Burbea et al . , 2002 ) . Mutations in unc - 11 , an orthologue of the AP180 clathrin adaptin protein , result in the increased accumula - tion of GLR - 1 at synaptic sites . It is unclear whether clathrin - independent pathways also mediate GLR - 1 endocytosis , or whether multiple endocytosis pathways regulate AMPAR trafﬁcking in general . Here , we identify RAB - 10 as a regu - lator of a novel AMPAR endocytosis and trafﬁcking path - way . We show that rab - 10 mutant animals display defects in GLR - 1 localization and behavior consistent with an intracel - lular endosomal accumulation of GLR - 1 in neurites . These mutant phenotypes were rescued cell - autonomously by ex - pression of a rab - 10 cDNA . Furthermore , we provide evi - dence to suggest that RAB - 10 functions in a genetic pathway parallel to that of LIN - 10 , a postsynaptic density 95 / disc - large / zona occludens ( PDZ ) - domain protein of the Mint / X11 family previously shown to be involved in AMPAR trafﬁcking ( Rongo et al . , 1998 ; Glodowski et al . , 2005 ) . We propose that RAB - 10 and LIN - 10 are components of two distinct pathways that regulate trafﬁcking of different pools of AMPARs at synapses . MATERIALS AND METHODS Genetics and Strains Standard methods were used to culture C . elegans . The following strains were used : N2 , lin - 10 ( e1439 ) , lin - 10 ( n1508 ) , unc - 11 ( e47 ) , rab - 10 ( dx2 ) , rab - 10 ( q373 ) , itsn - 1 ( ok268 ) , odIs22 [ P glr - 1 : : LIN - 10 : : GFP ] , odIs1 [ P glr - 1 : : SNB - 1 : : GFP ] , odIs42 [ P glr - 1 : : RFP : : RAB - 10 ] , nuIs89 [ P glr - 1 : : MUb ] , and nuIs25 [ GLR - 1 : : GFP ] . Transgenes and Germline Transformation Transgenic strains were isolated after microinjecting various plasmids ( 5 – 50 ng / (cid:2) l ) by using rol - 6dm ( a gift from C . Mello , University of Massachusetts Medical School ) , red ﬂuorescent protein ( RFP ) ( monomeric RFP ; a gift from R . Tsien , Stanford University School of Medicine ) , or lin - 15 ( (cid:1) ) ( a gift from J . Mendel , Cal Tech ) as a marker ( Campbell et al . , 2002 ) . Plasmids containing the glr - 1 promoter , followed by a gene encoding either RFP : : RAB - 10 or RFP : : RME - 1 , were introduced into the germline and followed as extrachro - mosomal arrays . To generate these plasmids , LR Clonase reactions ( Gateway Technology ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) were performed using entry clones containing genomic DNA encoding RME - 1 or cDNA encoding RAB - 10 . For these reactions , the destination vector , which contains the glr - 1 promoter upstream of a ccdB gene that is ﬂanked by attR sites , was generated from the plasmid , pV6 ( a gift from V . Maricq , University of Utah ) , following manu - facturer’s protocols ( Invitrogen ) . For RFP : : RAB - 10 , stable transgenic lines , including odIs42 , were obtained by (cid:3) - irradiation followed by four generations of backcrossing . Fluorescence Microscopy Green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - and RFP - tagged ﬂuorescent proteins were visualized in nematodes by mounting larvae on 2 % agarose pads with 10 mM levamisole . Fluorescent images were observed using an Axioplan II ( Carl Zeiss , Thornwood , NY ) . A 100 (cid:2) ( numerical aperture 1 . 4 ) PlanApo objective was used to detect GFP and RFP signal . Imaging was done with an ORCA charge - coupled device camera ( Hamamatsu , Bridgewater , NJ ) by using IPLab software ( Scanalytics , Fairfax , VA ) . Exposure times were chosen to ﬁll the 12 - bit dynamic range without saturation . Maximum intensity projections of z - series stacks were obtained , and out - of - focus light was removed with a constrained iterative deconvolution algorithm . Cluster outlines were auto - matically calculated for ﬂuorescent signals that were two standard deviations above the unlocalized baseline by using a macro written for IPLabs . Cluster size was measured as the maximum diameter for each outlined cluster . Cluster outline data included both small puncta ( e . g . , as observed in wild type ) , as well as long accretions ( e . g . , as observed in lin - 10 and rab - 10 mu - tants ) . Cluster number was calculated by counting the average number of clusters per 10 (cid:2) m of dendrite length . Behavioral Assays Nose - touch sensory responses were assayed as described previously ( Hart et al . , 1995 ) . Each animal was tested on food for reversal of locomotion after a forward collision with a hair . Each animal was tested 10 times , and 20 or more animals were tested for each genotype . The reversal frequency of individual animals was assayed as described previously , but with some modiﬁcations ( Zheng et al . , 1999 ) . Single young adult hermaphrodites were placed on nematode growth medium plates in the absence of food . The animals were allowed to adjust to the plates for 5 min , and the number of spontaneous reversals for each animal was counted over a 5 - min period . Animals in Figure 4F were touched on their posterior every 20 s to induce forward locomotion . Twenty animals were tested for each genotype , and the reported scores reﬂect the mean number of reversals per minute . Growth on Cholesterol - depleted Media For cholesterol - depleted growth of C . elegans , both OP50 bacterial media and C . elegans plate media were prepared using ether - extracted peptone as de - scribed previously ( Merris et al . , 2003 ) . Gravid animals were placed on plates containing cholesterol - depleted media , and they were allowed to lay eggs overnight . Adult animals were then removed , and the eggs were hatched and raised on cholesterol - depleted media . On reaching adulthood , animals were examined for GLR - 1 ﬂuorescence as described above . RESULTS RAB - 10 Is a Novel Regulator of GLR - 1 Trafﬁcking In the command interneurons of C . elegans , postsynaptic localization of a GFP - tagged version of the AMPAR subunit GLR - 1 ( GLR - 1 : : GFP ) has been characterized previously ( Rongo et al . , 1998 ) . GLR - 1 : : GFP is localized to small , multi - tudinous , synaptic clusters in the neurites of wild - type ani - mals ( Figure 1A ) . Because RAB - 10 is expressed in neurons as well as epithelia ( Chen et al . , 2006 ) , we tested whether RAB - 10 regulates the postsynaptic localization of AMPARs , comparing the localization of GLR - 1 : : GFP in a wild - type background to that in two different rab - 10 loss of function mutant backgrounds . Similar results were observed with both mutant alleles . In rab - 10 mutant animals , we observed an accumulation of GLR - 1 : : GFP in large accretions running along the length of the ventral cord neurite bundle ( Figure 1B ) . The size of these accretions is reminiscent of the intra - cellular membrane - bound compartments observed in the neurites of the ventral cord ( Rolls et al . , 2002 ) . The rab - 10 mutant phenotype is similar to the phenotype resulting from mutations in LIN - 10 ( Figure 1C ) , a PDZ domain protein of the Mint / X11 family ( Borg et al . , 1998 ; Butz et al . , 1998 ; Rongo et al . , 1998 ; Whitﬁeld et al . , 1999 ) . LIN - 10 / Mint / X11 proteins regulate AMPAR trafﬁcking ; however , their mech - anism of action is unclear ( Rongo et al . , 1998 ; Stricker and Huganir , 2003 ) . D . R . Glodowski et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 4388 We quantiﬁed the magnitude of the effect that various mutant backgrounds had on the localization of AMPARs by measuring the size of GLR - 1 : : GFP ﬂuorescent clusters . The average size of GLR - 1 – containing accretions in lin - 10 mu - tant animals was slightly larger than that observed in rab - 10 mutants ( Figure 1E ) . However , in either mutant back - ground , the average accretion size was nearly twice that of GLR - 1 clusters found in wild - type animals . We also deter - mined the average density ( number per neurite length ) of GLR - 1 : : GFP clusters present in neurites . We found slightly fewer GLR - 1 – containing clusters per 10 (cid:2) m in either mutant background , compared with wild - type animals ( Figure 1F ) . The effect of rab - 10 mutations on GLR - 1 localization might be indirectly caused by general defects in synapse forma - tion . To explore this possibility , we examined the localiza - tion of the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin ( SNB - 1 ) ( Nonet et al . , 1998 ) . SNB - 1 : : GFP , when expressed from the glr - 1 promoter , displays a punctate localization pattern , la - beling presynaptic boutons along neurites of the command interneurons in wild - type animals ( Rongo et al . , 1998 ; Shim et al . , 2004 ; Glodowski et al . , 2005 ) . We observed a similar punctate localization for SNB - 1 : : GFP in rab - 10 mutant ani - mals ( data not shown ) . We quantiﬁed the size and density of SNB - 1 : : GFP puncta , and we saw little difference between wild - type and rab - 10 mutants for either of these parameters ( Figure 1 , E and F ; dark gray bars ) . For SNB - 1 : : GFP clusters , we noticed slightly decreased ( but not statistically signiﬁ - cant ) puncta density in rab - 10 mutants compared with wild - type animals ( Figure 1F ) , but the size of these puncta re - mained constant regardless of genetic background ( Figure 1E ) . Mutations that are known to impair presynaptic bouton organization do not display the GLR - 1 localization pheno - type observed in rab - 10 and lin - 10 mutants ( Rongo et al . , 1998 ; Rongo and Kaplan , 1999 ) . Together , these ﬁndings demonstrate that the effect of rab - 10 mutations on GLR - 1 trafﬁcking is not due to gross synaptic misorganization . To determine whether RAB - 10 functions cell autono - mously in neurons to regulate GLR - 1 , we used the glr - 1 promoter to direct expression of RFP - tagged RAB - 10 ( RFP : : RAB - 10 ) in rab - 10 mutant animals . We found that rab - 10 mutant animals expressing RFP : : RAB - 10 lacked large GLR - 1 : : GFP – containing accretions ; instead , they contained small GLR - 1 : : GFP clusters similar to those found in wild - type animals ( Figure 1 , D and G ) . This result demonstrates that RFP : : RAB - 10 is functional and that RAB - 10 functions in a cell - autonomous manner to direct AMPAR trafﬁcking . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst report of a neuronal function for RAB - 10 . Interestingly , upon expression of RFP : : RAB - 10 , we observed an increase in the density of GLR - 1 – containing clusters in neurites of either wild - type or rab - 10 mutant animals ( Figure 1H ) . These data suggest that RAB - 10 can stimulate punctate localization of AMPARs in neuronal pro - cesses , an activity that has not been reported previously for any Rab protein . Mutations in Either rab - 10 or lin - 10 Result in Behavioral Phenotypes Indicative of Decreased GLR - 1 Signaling We reasoned that the aberrant accumulation of GLR - 1 ob - served in rab - 10 and lin - 10 mutants is likely due to defects in GLR - 1 membrane trafﬁcking . If mutations in rab - 10 or lin - 10 result in the accumulation of GLR - 1 at an internal membrane trafﬁcking compartment , then these mutations should result in corresponding GLR - 1 – mediated behavioral phenotypes ( Burbea et al . , 2002 ; Juo and Kaplan , 2004 ; Shim et al . , 2004 ; Umemura et al . , 2005 ; Schaefer and Rongo , 2006 ) . In C . elegans , GLR - 1 signaling positively regulates spontaneous reversals during forward locomotion as animals forage for food ( Mellem et al . , 2002 ; Zheng et al . , 2004 ) . Backward locomotion in C . elegans can also be induced by stimulating the mechanosensory neuron ASH , which makes glutamater - gic connections to the GLR - 1 – expressing interneurons Figure 1 . RAB - 10 regulates GLR - 1 trafﬁcking . GLR - 1 : : GFP ﬂuores - cence was observed along ventral cord dendrites of wild - type ani - mals ( A ) , rab - 10 mutants ( B ) , lin - 10 mutants ( C ) , or rab - 10 mutants ( D ) that express a wild - type rab - 10 cDNA ( with RFP fused in frame at N terminus ) by using the glr - 1 promoter . The mean size ( E ) and the mean density ( F ; number per 10 (cid:2) m of ventral cord ) of ﬂuores - cent puncta are plotted for adult nematodes of the given genotype and for the given ﬂuorescent reporter ( either GLR - 1 : : GFP , light gray bars , or SNB - 1 : : GFP , dark gray bars ) . The mean size ( G ) and density ( H ) of GLR - 1 clusters are plotted for either wild type or rab - 10 mutant adults that either lack ( (cid:3) , light gray bars ) or express ( (cid:1) , dark gray bars ) a rescuing - RFP : : RAB - 10 fusion protein from a trans - gene using the glr - 1 promoter . Whereas wild - type animals have small clusters of GLR - 1 : : GFP , rab - 10 and lin - 10 mutants accumulate GLR - 1 in large accretions ( arrows ) . Cell - autonomous expression of RFP : : RAB - 10 rescues the rab - 10 mutant , and it can increase the number of GLR - 1 clusters . Bar , 5 (cid:2) m . Error bars are SEM .

RAB - 10 Regulates GluR Recycling Vol . 18 , November 2007 4389 ( White et al . , 1986 ; Kaplan and Horvitz , 1993 ) . Mutants with reduced GLR - 1 activity have a lower frequency of sponta - neous reversals and are nose - touch insensitive , whereas mu - tants with increased GLR - 1 activity ( e . g . , higher levels of synaptic GLR - 1 at the cell surface ) have a higher frequency of spontaneous reversals ( Hart et al . , 1995 ; Maricq et al . , 1995 ; Burbea et al . , 2002 ; Mellem et al . , 2002 ; Juo and Kaplan , 2004 ; Shim et al . , 2004 ; Zheng et al . , 2004 ; Umemura et al . , 2005 ; Schaefer and Rongo , 2006 ) . We examined GLR - 1 – mediated behaviors in wild - type animals and in animals with mutations in lin - 10 and rab - 10 . Wild - type animals reversed direction in response to nose - touch with a frequency of (cid:6) 73 % ( 20 animals ; 10 trials per animal ) , whereas glr - 1 mutants only reversed direction in response to nose - touch with a frequency of (cid:6) 10 % ( Figure 2A ) . Like the glr - 1 mutants , both lin - 10 and rab - 10 mutants displayed signiﬁcantly reduced responses to nose - touch , with frequencies near 15 – 20 % , suggesting a reduction in GLR - 1 signaling in the absence of either LIN - 10 or RAB - 10 protein . When spontaneous reversals were assayed , we found that wild - type animals spontaneously reversed (cid:6) 1 . 6 times per minute ( 20 animals ; 5 - min trial per animal ) , whereas glr - 1 mutants only spontaneously reversed direc - tion (cid:6) 0 . 8 times per minute ( Figure 2B ) . Like glr - 1 mutant animals , the lin - 10 and the rab - 10 mutants spontaneously reversed direction (cid:6) 0 . 7 times per minute , a frequency that was statistically lower than that for wild - type animals ( Fig - ure 2B ) . Thus , the accumulation of GLR - 1 in neurites of both lin - 10 and rab - 10 mutant animals correlates with behaviors that indicate decreased synaptic strength . We also observed rescue of behavioral defects in rab - 10 mutant animals ex - pressing RFP : : RAB - 10 ( Figure 2C ) . Interestingly , whereas expression of RFP : : RAB - 10 results in more GLR - 1 : : GFP puncta , it does not result in a signiﬁcant increase in reversal frequency , suggesting that the additional puncta might not be at synapses . Taken as a whole , our results demonstrate that RAB - 10 and LIN - 10 are required in the interneurons for GLR - 1 – mediated behaviors , and they suggest that RAB - 10 and LIN - 10 mediate the exit of GLR - 1 from nonfunctional compartments within ventral cord neurites to its site of function on postsynaptic membranes . RAB - 10 and LIN - 10 Function in Two Parallel Pathways to Direct GLR - 1 Localization Because we observed similar phenotypes with respect to GLR - 1 localization and GLR - 1 – mediated behaviors in lin - 10 and rab - 10 mutant animals , we asked whether the LIN - 10 and RAB - 10 proteins might work together in a single path - way to mediate GLR - 1 trafﬁcking . To address this question , we examined the localization of GLR - 1 : : GFP in rab - 10 lin - 10 double mutant animals . Unexpectedly , we found a more severe defect in the accumulation of GLR - 1 : : GFP in rab - 10 lin - 10 double mutants than in either lin - 10 or rab - 10 single mutants ( Figure 3A ) . The average size of GLR - 1 – containing accretions was almost twice as large in double mutants as in either single mutant ( Figure 3B ) . In addition , we saw a slight reduction in cluster density ( Figure 3C ) . The mean sponta - neous reversal frequency of rab - 10 lin - 10 double mutants was similar to that observed in glr - 1 null mutants ( Figure 3D ) . Thus , there is an additive effect on GLR - 1 localization defects caused by the presence of null mutations in lin - 10 and rab - 10 , suggesting that LIN - 10 and RAB - 10 proteins function in parallel pathways .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 4390 UNC - 11 and ITSN - 1 Function Upstream of LIN - 10 but Not RAB - 10 Based on the behavioral phenotypes of lin - 10 and rab - 10 mutants , which indicated reduced levels of GLR - 1 at postsynaptic membranes , we hypothesized that the excess GLR - 1 in the neurites of these animals was accumulating in an intracellular endosomal compartment . If this is true , then mutations in the endosomal machinery involved in early steps of endocytosis and trafﬁcking should suppress the mutant phenotypes of rab - 10 and / or lin - 10 . Previously , UNC - 11 ( a clathrin adaptin protein AP180 orthologue that mediates endocytosis ) was identiﬁed as a regulator of the synaptic abundance of AMPARs ( Nonet et al . , 1999 ; Burbea et al . , 2002 ) . Indeed , mutations in unc - 11 result in an (cid:6) 50 % increase in the size of postsynaptic GLR - 1 clusters ( Figure 4 , A and D ) ( Burbea et al . , 2002 ) . To determine whether either LIN - 10 or RAB - 10 function in a linear pathway with UNC - 11 , we analyzed GLR - 1 : : GFP localization in both lin - 10 unc - 11 and rab - 10 unc - 11 double mutant animals . The lin - 10 unc - 11 animals lacked the GLR - 1 – containing accretions ob - served in lin - 10 single mutants ; instead , they contained nu - merous smaller clusters similar to those observed in unc - 11 mutants ( Figure 4 , B and D ) . A compelling reason for why the GLR - 1 accretions found in lin - 10 mutants are diminished when clathrin - mediated endocytosis is depressed is that less GLR - 1 is available to be trapped in internal compartments . By contrast , rab - 10 unc - 11 animals still possessed large GLR - 1 - containing accretions , which were larger than those in either unc - 11 or rab - 10 single mutants ( Figure 4 , C and E ) . These results suggest that unc - 11 is epistatic to lin - 10 but not rab - 10 , consistent with the idea that LIN - 10 and RAB - 10 function in distinct regulatory pathways . Furthermore , the additive effect of mutations in unc - 11 and rab - 10 suggests that UNC - 11 and RAB - 10 function in parallel pathways . Mutations in unc - 11 also partially suppressed the decrease in spontaneous reversals observed in lin - 10 mutants ( Figure 4F ) . Double mutants for rab - 10 unc - 11 were signiﬁcantly lethargic , precluding a similar behavioral analysis . Together , these data imply that the endocytosis of postsynaptic GLR - 1 can occur through more than one regulated pathway and that it may be clathrin dependent ( regulated by UNC - 11 and LIN - 10 ) or clathrin independent ( regulated by RAB - 10 ) . The Intersectin adaptor protein is thought to function in clathrin - dependent endocytosis by recruiting endocytosis machinery to clathrin - coated pits ( Yamabhai et al . , 1998 ; Sengar et al . , 1999 ; Simpson et al . , 1999 ; Koh et al . , 2004 ; Marie et al . , 2004 ) . The C . elegans genome contains a single Inter - sectin orthologue , called ITSN - 1 , which is most similar to Drosophila d ynamin - a ssociated p rotein of 160 kDa ( Dap160 ) and the short isoform of human ITSN1 ( Figure 5A ) . ITSN - 1 contains two Eps15 - homology ( EH ) domains , an Smc / coiled coil , and ﬁve Src Homology ( SH3 ) domains . We analyzed a deletion allele of itsn - 1 , called ok238 , which removes the Smc / coiled coil domain and a single SH3 domain . This deletion also shifts the reading frame to preclude translation of the remaining SH3 domains . We asked whether itsn - 1 ( ok238 ) could suppress the GLR - 1 localization phenotype of rab - 10 or lin - 10 mutants by examining the localization of GLR - 1 : : GFP in double mutant animals . We found that the average size of GLR - 1 - containing clusters in itsn - 1 mutant animals was only slightly larger than that in wild - type ani - mals ( Figure 5 , B and E ) . However , a mutation in itsn - 1 suppressed the lin - 10 mutant phenotypes for GLR - 1 local - ization ( Figure 5 , C and E ) as well as for GLR - 1 – mediated behavior ( Figure 5G ) . In addition , the rab - 10 mutant pheno - type was not suppressed by an itsn - 1 mutation ( Figure 5 , D , E , and H ) . This result is consistent with our hypothesis that two parallel pathways exist for GLR - 1 trafﬁcking , regulated either by LIN - 10 or RAB - 10 . Furthermore , these results sug - gest that ITSN - 1 functions upstream of LIN - 10 to promote GLR - 1 endocytosis . GLR - 1 Accumulation in rab - 10 Mutants Is Cholesterol Dependent If GLR - 1 is endocytosed by clathrin - independent endocyto - sis and recycled by RAB - 10 , then the intracellular accumu - lation of GLR - 1 in rab - 10 mutants should be suppressed by depressing clathrin - independent endocytosis . Clathrin - inde - pendent endocytosis is highly sensitive to cholesterol levels , and it is depressed under conditions of low cholesterol ( Johannes and Lamaze , 2002 ; Parton and Richards , 2003 ; Kirkham and Parton , 2005 ; Le Roy and Wrana , 2005 ) . We grew wild - type , lin - 10 , and rab - 10 animals on cholesterol - depleted media for one generation , and then we examined GLR - 1 localization in these animals ( Merris et al . , 2003 , 2004 ) . Because cholesterol depletion did not affect all animals equally , we categorized GLR - 1 localization for each animal as either “no phenotype” ( most GLR - 1 puncta are small , 0 . 4 – 0 . 8 (cid:2) m in diameter ) , “medium phenotype” ( animals had mostly small puncta but some larger GLR - 1 puncta , 0 . 8 – 1 . 2 (cid:2) m in diameter ) , or “strong phenotype” ( most GLR - 1 is in large accretions , usually (cid:7) 1 . 5 (cid:2) m in length ) . Categorization was scored blindly with respect to genotype and the presence of dietary cholesterol . Cholesterol deple - tion of wild - type nematodes resulted in a 70 % increase in the Figure 4 . UNC - 11 ( AP180 ) is required for GLR - 1 accumulation in lin - 10 mutants but not in rab - 10 mutants .

( F ) The mean spontaneous reversal frequency ( number of reversals per minute over a 5 - min period ) is plotted for the given genotype .

RAB - 10 Regulates GluR Recycling Vol . 18 , November 2007 4391 number of animals with large puncta like those found in unc - 11 mutants ( Figure 6 , A , C , and F ) , suggesting that , like mutations in unc - 11 , cholesterol depletion can depress GLR - 1 endocytosis . Cholesterol depletion of rab - 10 mutants resulted in a 40 % decrease in the number of animals with large accretions . Instead , these rab - 10 mutants contained GLR - 1 in mostly small clusters ( Figure 6 , B , D , and F ) , similar to those observed in wild - type animals , suggesting that cholesterol deprivation suppresses rab - 10 by preventing the internalization of GLR - 1 from synaptic sites to internal compartments . Presumably , the GLR - 1 accretions found in rab - 10 mutants are diminished in the absence of cholesterol , because less GLR - 1 is available to be trapped in internal compartments . By contrast , cholesterol deprivation had little effect on lin - 10 mutants ( Figure 6F ) . Our results indicate that the accumulation of GLR - 1 in rab - 10 mutant neurites re - quires a cholesterol - dependent step . LIN - 10 and RAB - 10 Are Localized to Distinct Subcellular Compartments To determine whether RAB - 10 and LIN - 10 associate with similar intracellular compartments in neurons , we coex - pressed LIN - 10 : : GFP together with RFP : : RAB - 10 , by using the glr - 1 promoter . In the intestinal epithelia of C . elegans , RAB - 10 associates with Golgi , and it is localized mainly to early endosomes ( Chen et al . , 2006 ) . Previously , we showed that LIN - 10 is present in Golgi and that it is localized to postsynaptic sites in neurons ( Glodowski et al . , 2005 ) . We found that , like LIN - 10 , RFP : : RAB - 10 is present in neuronal cell bodies as well as throughout the ventral nerve cord neurites . However , unlike LIN - 10 : : GFP , which localizes to relatively small , uniform puncta in neurites ( Figure 7A ) , RFP : : RAB - 10 localization is somewhat irregular with regard to the size and shape of clusters ( Figure 7B ) . Generally , RFP : : RAB - 10 - containing clusters were less abundant and larger than LIN - 10 : : GFP - containing clusters . This could in - dicate that early endosomal structures in neurites are mor - phologically dynamic as protein trafﬁcking rates change at different regions throughout the ventral nerve cord . We sometimes observed close association between RFP : : RAB - 10 and LIN - 10 : : GFP in neurites , as indicated by partial overlap between LIN - 10 : : GFP and RFP : : RAB - 10 clusters ( Figure 7C , arrowheads denote partial colocalization ) . We found (cid:6) 20 % of LIN - 10 : : GFP puncta were associated with a cluster of RFP : : RAB - 10 , whereas (cid:6) 40 % of RFP : : RAB - 10 clusters were associated with one or more LIN - 10 : : GFP puncta . We also compared the localization patterns of GLR - 1 : : GFP ( Figure 7D ) and RFP : : RAB - 10 ( Figure 7F ) in wild - type animals to deter - mine whether GLR - 1 clusters were colocalized with RAB - 10 . However , we found only (cid:6) 5 % of GLR - 1 : : GFP clusters associ - ated with RFP : : RAB - 10 clusters , and (cid:6) 10 % of RFP : : RAB - 10 clusters associated with GLR - 1 : : GFP . These ﬁndings indicate that RAB - 10 and LIN - 10 are largely present at distinct com - partments , and they raise the possibility that GLR - 1 might only be transiently associated with RAB - 10 in wild - type animals . We also looked at RFP : : RAB - 10 and GLR - 1 : : GFP in a lin - 10 mutant background . The localization pattern of RFP : : RAB - 10 was similar in wild - type ( Figure 7F ) and lin - 10 mutant ( Figure Figure 5 .

In addition , we found essentially no colocalization between the GLR - 1 : : GFP that accumulated in large accretions and RFP : : RAB - 10 ( Figure 7I ) . Therefore , we conclude that GLR - 1 does not accumulate in RAB - 10 – contain - ing early endosomes in lin - 10 mutants . Finally , we looked at LIN - 10 : : GFP in a rab - 10 mutant background , and we found that the localization pattern of LIN - 10 : : GFP was similar in wild type ( Figure 7J ) and rab - 10 mutants ( Figure 7K ) , suggesting that RAB - 10 is not required for the localization of LIN - 10 . DISCUSSION In this study , we identiﬁed RAB - 10 as a novel regulator of AMPAR trafﬁcking . Several lines of evidence suggest that at least two distinct pathways mediate vesicular trafﬁcking of GLR - 1 near synaptic sites . First , animals with mutations in both lin - 10 and rab - 10 displayed GLR - 1 localization defects that were much more severe than that of either rab - 10 or lin - 10 single mutants . Second , mutations that reduce clath - rin - dependent endocytosis ( e . g . , itsn - 1 ) suppressed the GLR - 1 – associated phenotypes in lin - 10 mutant animals but not those in rab - 10 mutants . Third , cholesterol depletion , which depresses clathrin - independent endocytosis mechanisms , suppressed the phenotype of rab - 10 mutants but not lin - 10 mutants . Finally , our ﬁndings showed minimal colocaliza - tion between RFP : : RAB - 10 and LIN - 10 : : GFP , suggesting that RAB - 10 and LIN - 10 are localized to distinct subcellular com - partments at steady state . However , it is possible that tran - sient associations between RAB - 10 and either GLR - 1 or LIN - 10 might still occur in vivo . Based on these results , we propose that RAB - 10 and LIN - 10 promote GLR - 1 trafﬁcking along distinct pathways by mediating exit of GLR - 1 from an intracellular endosomal compartment ( Figure 8 ) . RAB - 10 has been proposed to mediate trafﬁcking between different donor and target membranes in different cell - types . For example , in polarized Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells , RAB - 10 mediates transport from basolateral sorting endosomes to common endosomes that are accessi - ble to both apical and basolateral recycling pathways ( Babbey et al . , 2006 ) . In another polarized cell type , C . elegans intestinal epithelia , RAB - 10 is thought to mediate cargo re - cycling from early endosomes to recycling endosomes ( Chen et al . , 2006 ) . Such a hypothesis is consistent with the obser - vation that rab - 10 mutant animals display abnormally large early endosomes and that they lack recycling endosomes in intestinal cells . Because of the relatively small size of C . elegans neurons compared with intestinal epithelia , it is dif - Figure 6 . GLR - 1 accumulation in rab - 10 mutants is cholesterol - dependent . Wild - type animals grown on cholesterol - depleted me - dia were categorized as no phenotype ( most GLR - 1 puncta 0 . 4 – 0 . 8 (cid:2) m in diameter ) ( A ) or medium phenotype ( mostly small GLR - 1 puncta , with some GLR - 1 puncta 0 . 8 – 1 . 2 (cid:2) m in diameter ; arrow - heads ) ( C ) . Mutants for rab - 10 , when grown on cholesterol - depleted media , were similarly categorized as either no phenotype ( B ) , me - dium phenotype ( D ) , or strong phenotype ( E ) ( contain large GLR - 1 accretions (cid:7) 1 . 5 (cid:2) m in length ; arrows ) . ( F ) The frequency of adult animals with the indicated phenotype is plotted for each given genotype and experimental condition ( plus or minus cholesterol in growth media ) . Animals were categorized as described above ( no phenotype , white bars ; medium phenotype , gray bars ; or strong phenotype , black bars ) .

RAB - 10 Regulates GluR Recycling Vol . 18 , November 2007 4393 ﬁcult to determine whether large vesicular structures are present in neurites of rab - 10 mutant animals . So far , our attempts to identify additional ﬂuorescently labeled early endosomal markers with punctate localization in the nerve cord have not been successful . However , we did observe punctate localization of RFP - tagged RME - 1 , a marker for recycling endosomes , in the ventral nerve cord . Interest - ingly , this punctate localization of RFP : : RME - 1 persisted in both rab - 10 and lin - 10 mutant backgrounds ( data not shown ) , suggesting that these factors are not required in neurons for the formation of RME - 1 – containing recycling endosomes . Moreover , GLR - 1 is localized to puncta in rme - 1 mutants , similar to wild type ( data not shown ) . Thus , in neurons , it is possible that RAB - 10 and LIN - 10 mediate transport from early endosomes either directly to the syn - aptic membrane or to a compartment other than an RME - 1 - containing recycling endosome . Of course , we cannot rule out that RME - 1 and recycling endosomes participate in GLR - 1 trafﬁcking under speciﬁc circumstances ( e . g . , cellular stress , learning and memory , other forms of plasticity , et cetera ) . Previously , RAB - 10 was found localized within the Golgi of ﬁbroblasts ( Chen et al . , 1993 ) and sea urchin embryonic cells ( Leaf and Blum , 1998 ) , associated with common endo - somes in MDCK cells ( Babbey et al . , 2006 ) , and within Golgi and early endosomes in C . elegans intestinal epithelia ( Chen et al . , 2006 ) . In the sensory interneurons of C . elegans , we found RFP : : RAB - 10 present in the cell bodies as well as throughout the ventral nerve cord . In the cell bodies , most of the RFP : : RAB - 10 accumulated in vesicular bodies that colo - calized with LIN - 10 : : GFP , which we previously showed to be associated with Golgi ( Glodowski et al . , 2005 ) . In the neurites of the ventral nerve cord , RFP : : RAB - 10 – containing structures were variable in size and shape . Because the neurites of the command interneurons contain smooth mem - branes that resemble endosomes , but they lack clear Golgi and Golgi - resident markers , it is most likely that RFP : : RAB - 10 is decorating early endosomes in neurites , just as it does in epithelial cells ( Rolls et al . , 2002 ) . We observed low levels of colocalization between GLR - 1 : : GFP and RFP : : RAB - 10 , consistent with the idea that , at any one point in time , most GLR - 1 in the ventral nerve cord does not reside within early endosomes . Interestingly , we saw many RFP : : RAB - 10 structures associated with a LIN - 10 : : GFP puncta , raising the possibility that LIN - 10 might transiently interact with RAB - 10 – positive endosomal compartments . However , we think that GLR - 1 accumulation in rab - 10 and lin - 10 mutant animals occurs in distinct compartments , be - cause the general morphology of RFP : : RAB - 10 – containing clusters did not change in a lin - 10 mutant background . Sim - ilarly , the localization of LIN - 10 : : GFP did not change in the absence of RAB - 10 . Early endosomes are made up of sub - domains , and speciﬁc Rab GTPases delimit and occupy these subdomains ; thus , it is also possible that LIN - 10 and RAB - 10 function at distinct subdomains on the same endo - somes ( Pfeffer , 2003 ) . Interestingly , we observed an increase in the density of GLR - 1 – containing clusters upon overexpression of RFP : : RAB - 10 in wild - type animals , suggesting that , when present in a high enough concentration , RAB - 10 can stimulate the formation of GLR - 1 – containing puncta in neurites , perhaps by rescuing GLR - 1 receptors otherwise fated for degradation . However , because we did not observe a corresponding increase in GLR - 1 – mediated behaviors , it is unclear whether these additional GLR - 1 puncta are synaptic . We identiﬁed unc - 11 and itsn - 1 mutants as suppressors of GLR - 1 – associated defects in lin - 10 but not rab - 10 mutant animals . Intersectin proteins contain multiple protein – pro - tein interaction domains , and they have been shown to bind proteins involved in processes such as actin remodeling , signal transduction , exocytosis , and endocytosis ( Roos and Kelly , 1998 ; Koh et al . , 2004 ; Marie et al . , 2004 ; Martin et al . , 2006 ; Evergren et al . , 2007 ) . The Drosophila orthologue of Intersectin , Dap160 , is essential for viability , and it functions as an endocytic scaffolding protein at neuromuscular junc - tions ( Koh et al . , 2004 ; Marie et al . , 2004 ) . In mammals , which have two Intersectin homologues , there is evidence suggest - ing that an interaction between Intersectin and the E3 ubiq - uitin ligase Cbl is important for endocytosis and degrada - tion of epidermal growth factor receptor ( Martin et al . , 2006 ) . As in Drosophila , C . elegans has a single itsn - 1 gene , but null mutants in C . elegans are viable , with no obvious morpho - logical or behavioral defects , and only subtle GLR - 1 local - ization defects . However , we observed suppression of the lin - 10 phenotype by the itsn - 1 mutation . An unc - 11 mutation also suppressed lin - 10 , placing UNC - 11 and ITSN - 1 up - stream of LIN - 10 . Both Intersectin and UNC - 11 / AP180 are thought to direct clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Broadie , 2004 ) , and UNC - 11 is required for the endocytosis of some ubiquitinated GLR - 1 receptors ( Burbea et al . , 2002 ) . Why do itsn - 1 mutants not have a more dramatic GLR - 1 trafﬁcking defect by themselves ? In Drosophila , although Dap160 mu - tants are lethal , absence of Dap160 results in only a mild synaptic vesicle endocytic defect compared with mutants for other components of the endocytosis machinery ( Fergestad et al . , 1999 ; Verstreken et al . , 2002 ; Koh et al . , 2004 ; Marie et al . , 2004 ) . Greater defects are only revealed under conditions of severe demand on the synapse ( Koh et al . , 2004 ; Marie et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , the contribution of ITSN - 1 to GLR - 1 endo - Figure 8 . A model for the regulation of GLR - 1 AMPAR trafﬁcking . GLR - 1 ( gray channel ) is endocytosed through a combination of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( indicated to left of the synapse ) and clathrin - independent endocytosis ( indicated to the right of the syn - apse ) . Arrows indicate major trafﬁcking steps . In the clathrin - de - pendent pathway , endocytosis of GLR - 1 is mediated by UNC - 11 and ITSN - 1 . Once endocytosed , receptors can either be recycled to the synapse in a step requiring LIN - 10 , or degraded . By contrast , clathrin - independent endocytosis of GLR - 1 requires cholesterol , and it likely proceeds through lipid rafts . Once endocytosed , recep - tors can either be recycled to the synapse in a step requiring RAB - 10 , or degraded . For either pathway , it is possible that receptors are either recycled directly to the membrane ( as shown ) or through additional compartments ( not shown ) . D . R . Glodowski et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 4394 cytosis might only be revealed in lin - 10 mutants , where the recycling of GLR - 1 receptors has been impaired . It is well accepted that endocytosis can occur by a combi - nation of clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent pathways , with some pathway convergence at early endo - somes ( Johannes and Lamaze , 2002 ; Kirkham and Parton , 2005 ) . Because the accumulation of GLR - 1 in lin - 10 mutants can be suppressed by blocking clathrin - dependent endocy - tosis ( e . g . , by unc - 11 and itsn - 1 mutations ) , LIN - 10 likely recycles receptors that are endocytosed primarily by clath - rin - mediated endocytosis . Indeed , mammalian orthologues of LIN - 10 can interact with several small GTPases that reg - ulate clathrin - mediated membrane trafﬁcking ( Hill et al . , 2003 ; Teber et al . , 2005 ) . By contrast , the accumulation of GLR - 1 in rab - 10 mutants cannot be suppressed by reducing clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Interestingly , a stronger re - quirement for RAB - 10 is observed for the recycling of clath - rin - independent cargo versus clathrin - dependent cargo in intestinal epithelia , suggesting that RAB - 10 likely recycles receptors that are endocytosed primarily by clathrin - inde - pendent endocytosis ( Chen et al . , 2006 ) . Most forms of clath - rin - independent endocytosis proceed through lipid rafts rich in cholesterol ; cholesterol depletion inhibits lipid raft formation and depresses clathrin - independent endocytosis ( Johannes and Lamaze , 2002 ; Merris et al . , 2003 ; Parton and Richards , 2003 ; Kirkham and Parton , 2005 ; Le Roy and Wrana , 2005 ) . We ﬁnd that growth on cholesterol - depleted media suppresses the accumulation of GLR - 1 in rab - 10 but not lin - 10 mutants . Moreover , cholesterol depletion in wild - type animals causes GLR - 1 to accumulate in a manner sim - ilar to that of blocking clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( e . g . , unc - 11 mutants ) , suggesting that interneuron synapses prob - ably use a combination of the two endocytosis mechanisms to maintain the appropriate levels of synaptic GLR - 1 . Clearly , multiple trafﬁcking pathways are necessary to recycle GLR - 1 , because deﬁcits in either LIN - 10 or RAB - 10 function ( or in both ) result in behavioral defects similar to those observed in glr - 1 null mutations . Blocking clathrin - dependent endocytosis in a rab - 10 mutant enhances the rab - 10 mutant phenotype , suggesting that GLR - 1 receptors destined for clathrin - dependent endocytosis are now shunted to the clathrin - independent pathway , where they accumulate in RAB - 10 – containing early endosomes . Thus , the decision for a glutamate receptor to go down a given pathway seems to be made at the synapse , although this decision can be altered if one pathway is blocked . A com - plete understanding of how this decision is made will re - quire the identiﬁcation of the factors that specify trafﬁcking down one pathway versus the other . The use of both clathrin - dependent and clathrin - indepen - dent trafﬁcking pathways to regulate the same receptor is not unprecedented . For example , the combined use of these two pathways has important consequences for the regula - tion of the epidermal growth factor receptor and the trans - forming growth factor (cid:4) receptor ( Le Roy and Wrana , 2005 ; Sigismund et al . , 2005 ) . For AMPARs , multiple pathways might exist to provide neurons with more precise control over which AMPAR subunit combinations are present at a given synapse . Alternatively , the function of a particular pathway might depend on the activity of the circuit or changes in the environment . Indeed , it will be interesting to determine why a separate cholesterol - dependent AMPAR trafﬁcking pathway exists , and what role , if any , it has in synaptic or behavioral plasticity .
