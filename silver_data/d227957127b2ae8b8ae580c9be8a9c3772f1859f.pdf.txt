NATURE CELL BIOLOGY ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION 1 L E T T E R S Molecular architecture of a kinetochore – microtubule attachment site Ajit P . Joglekar 1 , David C . Bouck 1 , Jeffrey N . Molk 1 , Kerry S . Bloom 1 and Edward D . Salmon 1 , 2 Kinetochore attachment to spindle microtubule plus - ends is necessary for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division in all eukaryotes . The centromeric DNA of each chromosome is linked to microtubule plus - ends by eight structural - protein complexes 1 − 9 . Knowing the copy number of each of these complexes at one kinetochore – microtubule attachment site is necessary to understand the molecular architecture of the complex , and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying kinetochore function . We have counted , with molecular accuracy , the number of structural protein complexes in a single kinetochore − microtubule attachment using quantitative fluorescence microscopy of GFP - tagged kinetochore proteins in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . We find that relative to the two Cse4p molecules in the centromeric histone 1 , the copy number ranges from one or two for inner kinetochore proteins such as Mif2p 2 , to 16 for the DAM – DASH complex 8 , 9 at the kinetochore – microtubule interface . These counts allow us to visualize the overall arrangement of a kinetochore – microtubule attachment . As most of the budding yeast kinetochore proteins have homologues in higher eukaryotes , including humans , this molecular arrangement is likely to be replicated in more complex kinetochores that have multiple microtubule attachments . Accurate segregation of sister chromosomes during mitosis depends on the assembly of structural proteins at the kinetochore that link spindle microtubule plus - ends to centromeric DNA ( CEN DNA ) . The structural arrangement of these proteins within the kinetochore underlies its func - tion in force generation . It may also influence how the spindle assembly checkpoint senses kinetochore – microtubule attachment , and how errors in attachment are corrected to prevent chromosome mis - segregation . Although serial - section transmission electron microscopy has revealed the overall three - dimensional architecture of vertebrate kinetochores , the struc - ture of individual kinetochore – microtubule attachment remains poorly characterized . Consequently , a mechanistic model of kinetochore function that integrates the details of its structure cannot currently be constructed . To understand the molecular architecture of a kinetochore – microtubule attachment site , we focused on counting the copy number for the core structural kinetochore proteins and protein complexes that are necessary for stable kinetochore – microtubule attachment . Vertebrate kinetochores have a complex and dynamic structure with multiple attachment sites for kinetochore microtubules ( about 20 – 25 in humans ) . In contrast , each kinetochore in budding yeast makes only one stable microtubule attachment during metaphase , suggesting that its molecular composition may be stable and making it an ideal organism for investigating kinetochore structure . There are more than 60 known kinetochore proteins in budding yeast and homologues for most of these proteins have been identified in vertebrate systems 10 , 11 . Moreover , kineto - chore function in metaphase chromosome alignment and segregation in anaphase is similar in budding yeast and higher eukaryotes 12 . Therefore , insight into the molecular architecture of the budding yeast kinetochore will be valuable for understanding the kinetochore – microtubule interac - tion in higher eukaryotes , including humans . The DNA and protein composition of the budding - yeast kinetochore is well - understood . The kinetochore is built on a 125 base - pair stretch of CEN DNA that is composed of three distinct regions , CDE I , II and III . It is wrapped around a single nucleosome containing a centromere - specific histone H3 variant 1 , 13 named Cse4p ( the human homologue is hsCENP - A ) . Proximal to this nucleosome is the CBF3 complex 3 of four proteins that includes Ndc10p and Cep3p . The CBF3 complex specifi - cally binds to the CDE III region of the CEN DNA . Another protein , Mif2p ( hsCENP - C ) , binds to the CDE II region of CEN DNA . Next to this is the COMA complex of four proteins 4 including Okp1p ( hsCENP - F ) and Ctf19p . Recently , Spc105p was confirmed as a kinetochore pro - tein 5 . The homologue of Spc105p in Caenorhabditis elegans , KNL - 1 ( the uncharacterized human homologue is AF15q14 ) , is necessary for microtubule attachment . Spc105p associates with the MIND complex 14 , which contains Mtw1p ( hsMis12 ) . The COMA complex also recruits the non - essential protein Ctf3p ( hsCENP - I ) . In vertebrates , both CENP - I and Mis12 are required to recruit the outer kinetochore complex NDC80 ( ref . 10 ) . The NDC80 complex is a rod - like molecule that is approxi - mately 50 nm long , and has globular ends 7 . It contains four proteins including Ndc80p ( hsHec1 ) and Nuf2p ( hsNuf2 ) . Localization of anti - bodies to Ndc80 in vertebrate cells suggests that the Ndc80p – Nuf2p end 1 Department of Biology , University of North Carolina , 607 Fordham hall , CB # 3280 , Chapel Hill , NC 27599 , USA .

In budding yeast , the NDC80 complex and the microtubule associated protein complex , DAM – DASH , are both necessary for microtubule attachment 10 , 11 . The DAM – DASH complex is a heterodecamer and con - tains the protein Ask1p . Purified DAM – DASH complexes assemble into rings around microtubules in vitro 8 , 9 , which can slide passively along the microtubule lattice 8 . There are important practical advantages in using budding yeast to obtain accurate protein counts using fluorescence microscopy . A pro - tein of interest can be tagged at the carboxyl ( C ) - terminus with GFP at its chromosomal locus . The GFP - fluorescence signal is then a direct readout of the copy number for that protein 16 . The geometry of the budding - yeast spindle simplifies the quantification of the fluorescence signal from a GFP - tagged kinetochore protein . In metaphase , the sister kinetochores on the 16 chromosomes become arranged into two dis - tinct clusters of sub - resolution size on either side of the spindle equator along the spindle axis ( Fig . 1a ) . During anaphase , the kinetochore clus - ters move close to the spindle poles ( anaphase A ) as the spindle elon - gates ( anaphase B ) to push the poles apart ( Fig . 1a ) . The core structural proteins are concentrated exclusively at kinetochores in metaphase and anaphase , with the exception of the CBF3 and DAM – DASH complexes . In anaphase , components of the latter two complexes partially dissociate from the kinetochore , and also associate with the spindle microtubules ( Fig . 1a ) . Quantification of the fluorescence signal for a GFP - tagged protein in each kinetochore cluster provides the cumulative signal for 16 kinetochores , which can be used to measure the average number of molecules of that protein per kinetochore . The centromeric histone Cse4p is a core component of the kineto - chore . Cse4p shows virtually no turnover within a kinetochore clus - ter in metaphase , either through dissociation or through kinetochore movement from one spindle half to the other 17 . To test whether other structural kinetochore complexes are also similarly stable , fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) was measured for representa - tive GFP - tagged proteins from the CBF3 , COMA , MIND , NDC80 and DAM – DASH complexes . One of the two sister kinetochore clusters was photobleached in both metaphase and anaphase cells ( Fig . 1b , see Supplementary Information , Note 1 and Table S1 ) . The recovery was found to be undetectably low ( < 5 % ) in all cases . This low recovery is indicative of high protein stability at the kinetochore . FRAP measure - ments for CENP - I , CENP - H and Nuf2 in vertebrate cells show that these proteins are similarly stable 18 , 19 . These observations demonstrate that the core protein linkage between the CEN DNA and microtubule plus - ends is stable in metaphase and anaphase . A comparative approach was used to count the number of molecules of a specific protein at the kinetochore . There are two Cse4p molecules in the centromeric nucleosome 1 , 13 ( see Supplementary Information , Note 2 ) . The ratio of the average fluorescence signal for a kinetochore protein to the signal for Cse4p – GFP was multiplied by two to yield the average copy number per kinetochore for that protein .

The solid line represents the theoretical intensity distribution along the z axis . © 200 6 Nature Publishing Group L E T T E R S NATURE CELL BIOLOGY ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION 3 different strains — one expressing a GFP - tagged protein of interest and the other expressing Cse4p – GFP — were mixed together and immobi - lized on a coverslip for imaging ( see Methods ) . An image stack , with a 200 nm separation along the z axis between consecutive images , was then obtained for each cell ( Fig . 2a ) . The maxima of the intensity distribution of each kinetochore cluster along the z axis was determined with an average underestimation of 4 % ( Fig . 2c , see Supplementary Information , Note 3 ) . At this maxima , the fluorescence was integrated over a 5 × 5 pixel ( for anaphase – telophase cells ) or 6 × 6 pixel ( for metaphase cells ) region . The dimensions of the signal and the background region are dictated by the spread of the fluorescence intensity for a kinetochore cluster , which can be characterized by fitting the spatial intensity distribution with a Gaussian curve ( Fig . 2b , see Supplementary Information , Note 4 ) . The total signal was then obtained by integration over the intensity distribution using the 2σ limit ( where σ = s . d . for the Gaussian curve ) , after subtracting the background signal . Obtaining the ratio of the average signal values for the GFP - tagged protein of interest and Cse4p – GFP in each experiment avoids a direct evaluation of the in vivo fluorescence signal for one GFP molecule . This method also minimizes measurement errors . To test system linearity and accuracy , the metaphase and anaphase – telophase signals were evaluated for three strains expressing Nuf2p – GFP , Ndc80p – GFP or Nuf2p – GFP + Ndc80p – GFP . These measurements confirmed the 1 : 1 stoichiometry of Ndc80p and Nuf2p in the NDC80 complex 7 . As expected , the Nuf2 – GFP + Ndc80p – GFP signal was twice the signal for either Nuf2p – GFP or Ndc80p – GFP alone ( Fig . 3a ) . The variation in protein number per kinetochore is given by the s . d . of the average signal when the contribution of experimental errors is minimal . As the signal and the background can both be measured accurately in anaphase – telophase cells , the anaphase – telophase data was used for this analysis . It was found that the measured s . d . in anaphase – telophase cells was dominated by the signal loss due to spherical aberrations with increasing depth of the kinetochore cluster from the coverslip surface ( Fig . 3b ) . Therefore , the difference in measured signal was evaluated for two kinetochore clusters in the same cell that were separated by 600 nm or less along the z axis . The average value for this difference was approximately 10 % of the average signal , suggesting that the vari - ation in the protein number is less than one molecule per kinetochore ( see Supplementary Information , Note 5 ) . These results also apply to metaphase cells , as the protein complexes are stably anchored at the kinetochore in metaphase and anaphase . To image single kinetochores , we used cells carrying a conditional dicentric chromosome ( containing one conditional centromere in addi - tion to the wild - type centromere 20 ) and expressing Nuf2p – GFP . The induction of the conditional centromere produces one or two lagging chromatids in mid - anaphase , with their kinetochores visible as separated fluorescence foci along the spindle axis ( Fig . 3c ) . The ratio of signal for the nearest kinetochore cluster to the signal from these foci was found to be 16 : 1 ± 2 , thus verifying that these foci are single kinetochores . These measurements demonstrate that accurate measurement of as few as seven closely clustered GFP molecules is possible in vivo ( seven being the anaphase number of Nuf2p molecules per kinetochore ; see Table 1 ) . More importantly , these measurements validate our method of calculating the average number of proteins per kinetochore based on the cumulative fluorescence of 16 kinetochores in a cluster . Table 1 lists the observed counts for the average protein number per kine - tochore for representative proteins from each protein complex . A possible arrangement of the essential structural protein complexes at the budding yeast kinetochore in metaphase , based on these protein numbers , and the structures of the DAM – DASH complex and the NDC80 complex 7 – 9 , 21 , is shown in Fig . 4 . The protein linkage between the CEN DNA and a micro - tubule plus - end begins with the centromeric nucleosome incorporating two Cse4p molecules . Next is the CBF3 complex that incorporates one dimer each of Ndc10p and Cep3p . The counts for Ndc10p and Cep3p ( four and two , respectively ; see Supplementary Information , Note 6 ) together show that there is only one CBF3 complex per kinetochore 22 . It is likely that the extra Ndc10p dimer binds to the CDE II region of CEN DNA , independent of its inclusion in the CBF3 complex , as suggested by in vitro experiements 23 . The count for Cep3p also supports the inclusion of only two Cse4p molecules per kinetochore . The average fluorescence signal for Mif2p shows that each kinetochore has at least one Mif2p molecule , although some kinetochores carry two . Members of the COMA complex show interactions with Cse4p in two - hybrid assays 4 , 24 , along with a genetic interaction between Ctf19p and the amino ( N ) terminus of Cse4p 24 . The low copy number ( 1 – 2 ) for these protein complexes supports the presence of a network of inner kinetochore proteins 4 , suggested by genetic and bio - chemical interactions between members of these protein complexes .

The coefﬁ cient of variation ( s . d . / mean ) was better than 0 . 26 in all the measurements with the exception of Cep3p , for which the coefﬁ cient is 0 . 5 . The asterisks indicate that the reported ratio is ( Nuf2p – signal ) : ( protein signal ) . Mif2p – GFP , Ctf19p – GFP and Nkp2 – GFP measurements were carried out with Nuf2p – GFP as the reference signal ( see Methods ) . © 200 6 Nature Publishing Group L E T T E R S 4 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION Five molecules of Spc105p were found . This protein immunopre - cipitates with members of the MIND complex 5 , of which there are six or seven copies . The number of Mtw1p molecules is also close to the number of NDC80 complex molecules ( eight ) . In vertebrate cells , the NDC80 complex is arranged with the Ndc80 N - terminal domain within the outer kinetochore , where microtubule plus ends are located 15 . Although a link between the NDC80 and the DAM – DASH complexes has not been directly established , there is indirect evidence for interac - tions between these complexes in the form of in vitro binding between Ndc80p and Dam1p 25 , and two - hybrid interactions between Ndc80p and DAM – DASH complex members ( Dam1p and Spc19p ) 26 . Moreover , both of these complexes are necessary for end - on microtubule attach - ments . The two - headed N - termini of the NDC80 molecules are there - fore positioned symmetrically around an oligomeric DAM – DASH complex ring in Fig . 4 . The metaphase count for the DAM – DASH complex ( 16 – 20 copies ) reported here agrees well with the number of molecules required to form one DAM – DASH ring around a microtubule in vitro 8 . Biochemical esti - mation of the number of DAM – DASH complexes in a cell also suggests that there are not many more molecules than those needed to form one ring per kinetochore microtubule 9 . Because DAM – DASH is a microtu - bule associated protein complex , the DAM – DASH complex may also localize along the microtubule outside of the kinetochore . However , the high stability of this complex within a kinetochore cluster , in compari - son with the rapid tubulin turnover within spindle microtubules ( half life = 60 s ) 27 , suggests that most of the DAM – DASH complex molecules must bind stably at the kinetochores ( see Supplementary Information , Note 7 ) . The metaphase and late anaphase – telophase counts for all the kinetochore complexes are similar , with the exception of DAM – DASH and Ndc10p , both of which also localize to the spindle in anaphase ( Fig . 1a ) . Interestingly , the copy numbers for the non - essential proteins 11 ( Ctf3p , Chl4p and Nkp2p ) show that these complexes exist in minimal copy number ( one per kinetochore ) . Preliminary measurements show that the metaphase signal for these proteins is similar to their respective anaphase−telophase signal . This study demonstrates that the kinetochore – microtubule attach - ment site is built from a low and standardized number of copies of structural protein complexes . Previous studies of the structure of verte - brate kinetochores with multiple microtubule attachment sites indicate that it is constructed from a number of identical units spread along the centromere 28 . This repeat - subunit structure of the kinetochore may be attained by replicating individual microtubule attachment sites , simi - lar to the one at the budding yeast kinetochore . The molecular counts allow us to visualize possible arrangements of the structural proteins within the kinetochore . Kinetochore structure influences its function in microtubule polymerization – depolymerization - coupled force gen - eration , in regulation of attachment stability based on mechanical cues such as tension , and in communicating attachment status to the spin - dle - assembly checkpoint . The combination of previous biochemical and genetic analyses with the molecular counts for structural proteins reported here provides the foundation for building a mechanistic model of these kinetochore functions . METHODS Yeast strains and growth conditions . All strains were constructed in the YEF473A background unless otherwise noted ( see Supplementary Information , Table S5 ) . GFP fusions were made by PCR amplification of a GFP – KAN r cas - sette ( from pFA6a – GFP ( S65T ) KAN r MX6 ) flanked with 60 base pairs of homology to the site of integration at the 3 ′ end of the gene 29 . Cells were grown in YPD at 25 °C to mid - log phase before imaging . For induction of the conditional centromere on the dicentric chromosome , a mid - log phase culture grown on galactose media was shifted to glucose media for 2 h before imaging . For imaging , cells were suspended in filter sterile synthetic dextrose media , and immobilized on standard glass coverslips coated with 0 . 5 mg ml – 1 of concanavalin A ( cat . no . C7275 , Sigma ) .

Image acquisition was carried out on an Eclipse TE2000 - U ( Nikon , Melville , NY ) microscope with a 1 . 4 NA , 100 × DIC oil immersion lens and the standard yEGFP filter set from Chroma ( Rockingham , VT ) . Images were acquired with an ORCA ER cooled CCD camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics , Bridgewater , NY ) with 2 × 2 binning and using MetaMorph ( Molecular Devices , Downingtown , PA ) as the image acquisition software . A 300 × 300 pixel - wide region in the middle of the field of view of the microscope was acquired to minimize the non - uniformities in the illumination field . Twenty one z sections were acquired through each cell by stepping the stage in 200 nm steps with respect to the objective . A 400 ms integration time was used for all the measurements . Cells belonging to the two strains ( the protein of interest and Cse4p – GFP ) were differentiated based on significant differences in the fluorescence of their kineto - chore clusters . This was not possible in the case of Mif2p – GFP and Ctf19p – GFP when using Cse4p – GFP in the reference strain . Therefore , a reference strain containing Nuf2p – GFP was used for these two proteins . Data analysis was carried out in MatLAB ( Mathworks Inc . , Natick , MA ) using a custom written graphical user interface . The plane with the maximum intensity pixel was found in a 10 × 10 pixel user - selected region in the 21 z - plane stack . In this plane , the signal was computed by integrating the signal intensity in a 5 × 5 pixel square centred on the maximum intensity pixel for telophase measurements . A 6 × 6 - pixel square was used for metaphase measurements because of the larger size of the signal . For anaphase – telophase cells , a larger concentric box of the appropriate dimension was used to calculate the background . The proximity of the two kinetochore clusters in metaphase cells prevented the use of this method . Therefore , the background region was chosen manually by drawing a 6 × 6 - pixel box in the vicinity of the spindle inside the cell . FRAP measurements . FRAP measurements were carried out on metaphase and anaphase cells expressing Ndc10p – GFP , Ctf19p – GFP , Mtw1p – GFP , Nuf2p – GFP and Ask1 – GFP as previously described 30 .

FRAP experiments were performed as described previously 1 , 2 . The measurements have been tabulated as : the number of cells with no detectable signal recovery over the time of observation , number of cells with measurable turn - over , and the fraction of signal recovered in case fluorescence recovery was observed ( in parentheses ) . ( 2 ) Use of Cse4p - GFP as the reference – Cse4p - GFP is a stable , core component of the kinetochore , and gets incorporated into the centromeric nucleosome during DNA synthesis 1 . It was therefore used as a reference for deducing the number of metaphase and anaphase / telophase molecules for the rest of the kinetochore complexes from the ratio of the average signal intensity for Cse4p - GFP and a GFP - tagged protein of interest . Cse4p - GFP turn - over within a cluster has been shown to be extremely low in metaphase spindles , both from protein dissociation and kinetochore movement from one spindle half to the other 1 . We verified the stability of Cse4p from metaphase to anaphase / telophase , by comparing the Cse4p - GFP signal in the respective cell phases . The measured ratio for Cse4p - GFP signal ( metaphase / anaphase ) was 1 . 07±0 . 01 ( based on 3 experiments ) . The slightly higher signal in metaphase is the result of the geometrical differences between metaphase and anaphase / telophase spindles . While the centre of the metaphase kinetochore clusters is rarely separated by more than 3 Z planes ( with 200 nm increments between steps ) , the centres of the kinetochore clusters in the longer anaphase / telophase spindles can be separated by as many as 10 Z planes because of the long length of the spindle . By limiting the mean signal to the © 200 6 Nature Publishing Group 2 measurements from the first 10 Z planes of each stack , we found the metaphase to anaphase / telophase ratio to be 1 . 0±0 . 07 . The difference in the average signal value for the entire metaphase and anaphase / telophase data sets is also statistically insignificant ( t - tests assuming unequal variance yield two - sided p - values of 0 . 12 , 0 . 15 , and 0 . 27 ) . ( 3 ) Metaphase intensity distribution in Z for Ask1p - GFP – Characterization of the intensity distribution for a kinetochore cluster along the Z axis allows us to calculate the step - size dependent error in imaging the maxima in the intensity distribution . With a 200 nm distance ( step - size ) between successive images , the maximum error will occur when the two images are acquired at 100 nm on either side of the intensity maxima . With the observed intensity distribution shown in Fig . S1 , this maximum error will result in an approximately 8 % underestimation of the actual value . The average error will result in a 4 % underestimation of the measured signal . Fig . S1 shows the average intensity distribution in Z ( 3 cells ) for Nuf2p - GFP in anaphase / telophase ( open circles ) . Measurements for Ask1p - GFP in metaphase are also shown ( average of 2 cells , filled circles ) . To avoid contamination of the intensity distribution of a metaphase kinetochore cluster due to the fluorescence of the sister kinetochore cluster in the other spindle half , one of the kinetochore clusters in the cell was first bleached before carrying out the measurements on the other cluster . As seen from Fig . 2c in the main text and Fig . S1 , the intensity distribution for a kinetochore cluster in both metaphase and anaphase / telophase can be approximated by that for a 200 nm fluorescent bead ( Fig . 2c in the main text ) . This is consistent with the geometry of the budding yeast spindle . © 200 6 Nature Publishing Group 3 ( 4 ) Error arising from the alignment of a pixel array with an imaged kinetochore cluster - Integration of the imaged intensity distribution with the pixel array of a CCD camera introduces a measurement error that depends on the alignment of the centre of the spot with a pixel in the pixel array . For telophase cells , a 5x5 pixel array was used to cover the spot ( 143x4 nm ) . For anaphase / telophase measurements , the maximum intensity pixel was assigned to be the central pixel ( 3 , 3 ) in the 5x5 pixel box . The maxima of the imaged intensity distribution will rarely align with the centre of one of the pixels introducing an error . The magnitude of this error can be estimated by considering a one dimensional Gaussian intensity distribution . The error will be minimized when the maximum of the Gaussian distribution falls exactly at the centre of a pixel of the CCD array , whereas the maximum error will occur when the maximum of the intensity distribution falls at the edge of two pixels ( illustrated in Fig . S2 ) . In reality , the alignment of the maximum of the PSF with a pixel will be uniformly distributed between these two extremes . The average error in the integrated signal will be ~ 2 % of the actual signal . The metaphase spot measurements were done using a 6x6 pixel array . The signal measurement box was drawn by assigning the maximum pixel of the image to pixel ( 4 , 4 ) . This introduces a constant error in measurement on top of a variable error similar to the case above . The error amounts to a 9 % underestimation of the total signal in the worst case ( when the maxima of the Gaussian curve aligns with the edge of the ( 4 , 4 ) pixel ) , and a best case error of only 5 % ( when the maxima aligns with the centre of a pixel ) . The average error in this case will result in a 7 % underestimation . © 200 6 Nature Publishing Group 4 It should be noted that this estimation was done for a 1 - D Gaussian curve in the absence of any noise ( background and shot noise ) . The magnitude of error is proportional to the magnitude of the signal , and its effect will be minimized in a ratio of two averaged intensity values . ( 5 ) True signal variance – The distance of the kinetochore cluster away from the coverslip strongly affects the signal magnitude due to spherical aberrations that increase with depth ( Fig . 3b in the main text ) . This effect does not depend on the absolute magnitude of the signal , and thus does not distort the ratio of two fluorescence signals . However , the resultant variation of the signal about the mean signal masks information about the variation in the protein number . Table S2 lists the mean and standard deviation for three different strains spanning the range of signals measured in this study . We compared the difference in the signal values for the two kinetochore clusters from the same cell that were separated by a Z distance of 400 nm or less . As can be seen from Table S2 , the difference in measured intensity values for these kinetochore clusters is small as compared to the total signal . The standard error of the mean fluorescence value based on this difference is also very small . It can be stated in terms of the number of GFP molecules , by using the average Cse4p - GFP signal ( 1945 counts for 32 GFP molecules at 16 kinetochores - > 60 counts per GFP molecule ) . Thus , the difference between two kinetochore clusters in the same cell for Cse4p is ~ 4 GFP molecules out of 32 , while that for Ndc80p - GFP + Nuf2p - GFP is 20 GFP molecules out of 256 . It should also be noted that the standard deviation roughly scales with the mean . This translates into a variation of less than one molecule per kinetochore for each protein . © 200 6 Nature Publishing Group 5 Because of the suitable spindle geometry of late anaphase / telophase cells , it is possible to accurately measure both signal and background . The geometry of the metaphase spindles forces manual selection of the background region , introducing an additional source of variance in the signal , which is difficult to quantify . The turn - over of all the complexes at the kinetochore is low in metaphase and in telophase . Therefore , the protein number variance in metaphase cells will also be similarly low . ( 6 ) High background in cells expressing Cep3p - GFP – The high , inhomogeneous background in cells expressing Cep3p - GFP ( Fig . S3 ) increased the measurement errors in metaphase for this protein . Both Cep3p and Ndc10p also bind spindle MTs in anaphase ( Localization for Ndc10p is shown in Fig . 1a ) . Our measurements for the copy number in anaphase show a decrease in the number of both Cep3p and Ndc10p by the same fraction ( a decrease in the ratio from 1 . 9±0 . 2 to 1 . 3±0 . 01 for Ndc10p and from 0 . 9±0 . 2 to 0 . 6±0 . 01 for Cep3p – a 1 . 5 - fold decrease in the protein number from metaphase to anaphase in either case ) . ( 7 ) Contribution of Ask1p localized to the spindle – The DAM / DASH complex localizes to kinetochores as well as spindle / interpolar MTs in anaphase . Since it is a MT - associated protein , it may localize to MTs outside of the kinetochore in metaphase . Such DAM / DASH complex molecules not localized to the kinetochore will inflate the measured signal . It is difficult to estimate the amount of DAM / DASH bound to the MTs outside of the kinetochore in metaphase cells due to the near sub - diffraction size of the metaphase half - spindle . We used the fluorescence signal from Ask1p - GFP bound to the anaphase spindles to gauge the magnitude of the signal © 200 6 Nature Publishing Group 6 contributed by Ask1p - GFP bound to MTs outside of the kinetochore . To estimate the contribution of Ask1p - GFP bound along a MT , we averaged the intensity value over the in - focus sections of the spindle from several cells with an 8 pixel wide line . Each pixel in the kinetochore cluster spot was then assumed to have this average value as the contribution of DAM / DASH bound to non - kinetochore regions of the MTs . Therefore , the average pixel value multiplied by 36 ( the area of a 6x6 pixel box used for metaphase signal measurements ) was subtracted from the average signal value for the DAM / DASH complex . This calculation reduces the measured number of DAM / DASH complex molecules by 3 or 4 . This exercise demonstrates that even after the application of this correction , there is a sufficient number ( 16 copies ) of DAM / DASH complex molecules at the kinetochore to form one ring . The distribution of Ask1p - GFP fluorescence with respect to the fluorescence for the spindle pole bodies ( Spc29 - RFP ) resembles the distribution of other kinetochore proteins ( Fig . S4 ) . This further suggests that most of the Ask1p - GFP remains concentrated at the kinetochores , and not on the spindle MTs . ( 8 ) GFP response to excitation intensity – Fig . S5 shows the GFP emission response to excitation intensities . This behavior has been verified for single GFP molecules in vitro 3 . The data has been fitted to an equation of the form 3 : Signal = constant / ( 1 + Saturation Intensity / Intensity ) Our protein number measurements were carried out using the highest intensity in Fig . S5 ( indicated by the dotted line ) , which falls in the non - linear response range for the GFP molecules . The non - linear behavior does not affect ratio measurements , as the total signal is the sum of the signal response from each of the individual GFP © 200 6 Nature Publishing Group 7 molecules in the cluster to the illumination intensity . The non - linear behavior provides some protection against small fluctuations in the epi - illumination due to fluctuations in the arc lamp intensity . Fluorophore bleaching at this illumination intensity and exposure time is minimal ( ~ 1 % ) . Fig . S5 also displays the linear behavior of the filters and the rest of the microscope optical system . The data was obtained by imaging 200 nm green fluorescent beads at a much lower excitation intensity ( ~ 0 . 03x ) and integration time ( 50 ms ) . ( 9 ) Variation in the Cse4p - GFP mean signal due to variations in excitation intensity – The mean signal value for Cse4p - GFP was found to be different for each experiment ( Fig . S6 ) . This is most likely due to the changes in the excitation intensity resulting from the differences in the alignment of the arc lamp with respect to the specimen plane ( which was done manually ) , and changes in the arc lamp itself over time . This change in the mean signal value demonstrates the importance of ratio measurements as opposed to relying on the absolute fluorescence signal of a single GFP molecule .
