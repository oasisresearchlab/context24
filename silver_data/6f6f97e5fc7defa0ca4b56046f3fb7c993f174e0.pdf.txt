Academic Editor : Guillermo T . Sáez Received : 22 December 2014 / Accepted : 9 February 2015 / Published : 13 February 2015 Abstract : The actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin protein family is essential for actin dynamics , cell division , chemotaxis and tumor metastasis . Cofilin - 1 ( CFL - 1 ) is a primary non - muscle isoform of the ADF / cofilin protein family accelerating the actin filamental turnover in vitro and in vivo . In response to environmental stimulation , CFL - 1 enters the nucleus to regulate the actin dynamics . Although the purpose of this cytoplasm - nucleus transition remains unclear , it is speculated that the interaction between CFL - 1 and DNA may influence various biological responses , including DNA damage repair . In this review , we will discuss the possible involvement of CFL - 1 in DNA damage responses ( DDR ) induced by ionizing radiation ( IR ) , and the implications for cancer radiotherapy .

Introduction According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally . The occurrence of cancer in part correlates to the accumulation of DNA damage and loss or deterioration of normal genomic control [ 1 ] . A variety of strategies have been used to treat human cancers , but the efficacy of these approaches depends on the types of tumor cells [ 2 – 4 ] . An evidence - based analysis indicates that the utilization rate of radiotherapy is close to 52 % compared to other therapies [ 5 ] . Although several novel biomedical techniques and new drugs have been developed to conquer cancers , radiotherapy remains an important primary or adjuvant method for cancer treatment . In adherent cells , actin filaments are important for cell attachment and spreading on the substratum , and this process is required for cell proliferation . The significance of actin filaments is to convey the extracellular signals and form an appropriate shape for G1 phase progression [ 6 – 11 ] . Destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton using actin - targeting toxins ( ATT ) has been reported to cause reversible G1 phase arrest [ 12 ] , although long - term treatment of these toxins would lead to apoptosis [ 13 – 15 ] . ATT was developed for chemotherapy , and considered in combination with radiation for cancer treatment [ 16 – 18 ] . However , the efficacy of different ATTs on the enhancement of radiosensitivity remains controversial . For instance , the G1 phase is sub - sensitive to ionizing radiation compared to G2 / M phase arrest . Therefore , ATT - mediated accumulation of cells in the G1 phase may not be beneficial for increased radiosensitivity , except for the additional damage incurred by these cells . It is also possible that different types of ATT may trigger different molecular signaling pathways to respond differently to ionizing radiation . Clarification of these signaling pathways triggered by ATT may explain the conflict radiation responses induced by these compounds . Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is dependent on a variety of actin - associated proteins ( AAPs ) . These AAPs accelerate the actin dynamics by polymerization and depolymerization of monomeric actin , as well as promotion of nucleotide exchange of ADP - bound actin . The members of the actin depolymerizing factor protein family are known to sever and / or depolymerize actin filaments in vitro and in vivo [ 19 – 21 ] . It is believed that these actions would replenish the actin pools and the quantities of actin filaments for actin cytoskeletal turnover . Accumulated reports have also shown that cofilin - 1 ( CFL - 1 ) , the primary non - muscle isoform of the ADF / cofilin protein family may also be involved in signaling transduction , nuclear entry of actin , and actin rod formation in the nucleus [ 22 – 24 ] . Our previous and recent studies also found that over - expression of CFL - 1 could delay DNA repair after irradiation [ 25 ] . Interestingly , certain ATTs that differently affect CFL - 1 activity also display distinct radiation response . In this review , we will discuss the role of CFL - 1 , actin cytoskeleton and other AAPs on DDR , and the implication of actin targeting for cancer radiotherapy . 2 . The Actin Depolymerizing Factor ( ADF ) / Cofilin Signaling Pathways and Actin Dynamics In the past three decades , studies of the ADF / cofilin family in various organisms have demonstrated that this molecule plays a crucial role in regulating actin dynamics , which affects locomotion , migration , and cell viability . The ADF protein was first identified from embryonic chick brain by Bamburg et al . [ 26 ] , and related isoforms were subsequently found in a variety of organisms via functional assay and sequence similarity [ 27 , 28 ] . The first mammalian ADF protein was isolated from bovine brain extracts Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2015 , 16 4097 by Berl et al . [ 29 ] , and subsequently found in the porcine brain extracts and kidney ( also called destrin ) [ 30 , 31 ] . In 1984 , Maekawa et al . purified cofilin from porcine brain , and it is subsequently characterized to bind to actin subunits on F - actin in a 1 : 1 ratio , and it is named through the formed cofiliamentous structure with actin [ 30 , 32 , 33 ] . CFL - 1 is classified as the non - muscle isoform of the ADF / cofilin protein family , and its full cDNA sequence was first cloned to deduce the amino acid sequence [ 34 ] . Although ADF and CFL - 1 share 70 % of sequence identity and they functionally overlap , CFL - 1 is the major non - muscle isoform of ADF / cofilin in various cell types [ 35 ] . On the other hand , deletion of the CFL - 1 gene leads to lethality in mouse , yeast , fruit fly , and blastomere of Xenopus , suggesting that the functions of CFL - 1 and ADF are not redundant [ 19 , 36 , 37 ] . Several important characteristics of CFL - 1 will be discussed below . 2 . 1 . Biophysics and Biochemistry of Cofilin - 1 ( CFL - 1 ) The fundamental function of CFL - 1 is to accelerate the turnover of actin filaments by depolymerizing or severing the actin filaments . Interestingly , this action can enhance the actin polymerization for cell motility and other physiological behaviors . The depolymerization activity of CFL - 1 can enhance actin dissociation from the pointed ends of actin filaments . The pointed ends of actin filaments contain ADP - bound actin subunits bound by CFL - 1 . Binding of CFL - 1 opens the nucleotide - binding cleft of actin subunits on the filament , increases the average distance of adjacent actin subunits in the long - axis filaments and weakens the mutual interaction of actin subunits [ 38 ] . Therefore , the ADP - actin pool will be replenished by depolymerized actin that is subsequently converted to ATP - actin for the next round of polymerization . For the severing activity of CFL - 1 , the pointed end of actin filaments is occupied by CFL - 1 to render a mechanical discontinuity of filaments [ 21 ] . The free barbed ends will increase by the severing activity of CFL - 1 , and they are the new sites for actin polymerization to enhance the actin dynamics [ 39 ] . Additionally , different concentrations of CFL - 1 will also determine its action on nucleation or severing actin filaments [ 40 ] . Real - time fluorescent microscopic observation has shown that low CFL - 1 concentration promotes severing of actin filaments , while high CFL - 1 concentration decreases the extent of actin filamental severing [ 40 , 41 ] . When the CFL - 1 / actin ratio is high , actin - interacting protein 1 ( Aip1 ) can bind to the CFL - 1 - actin filament and promote depolymerization of actin filaments to generate monomeric actins [ 42 , 43 ] . Additionally , CFL - 1 binding to actin filaments is cooperative , but it actually does not affect the off - rate of actin filaments [ 44 ] . The function of CFL - 1 on the turnover of actin filaments does not only rely only on the protein itself but also the environmental conditions . For example , growth factor - stimulated cell migration induces dramatic actin reorganization at the leading edge of cells , and this is associated with activation of CFL - 1 via protein dephosphorylation and dissociation from phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ) [ 22 ] . Phosphorylation of the third serine residue ( ser - 3 ) on CFL - 1 is believed to inactivate itself on actin depolymerization because the affinity between phosphorylated CFL - 1 and actin is greatly reduced [ 45 ] . The ratio of phosphorylated CFL - 1 to total CFL - 1 is approximately 20 % – 50 % in nontransformed mammalian cells [ 46 , 47 ] . CFL - 1 can be phosphorylated by serine / threonine kinases including LIM kinase 1 ( LIMK1 ) , LIM kinase 2 ( LIMK2 ) and testicular protein kinase 1 / 2 ( TESK1 / 2 ) [ 48 ] . On the other hand , slingshot ( SSH ) phosphatase and chronophin can specifically dephosphorylate CFL - 1 on ser - 3 . A recent report also proposes that tumor suppressor PTEN phosphates Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2015 , 16 4098 can directly dephosphorylate CFL - 1 when prostaglandin E ( 2 ) ( PGE ( 2 ) ) is used to inhibit the phagocytosis of fungi , although it is not evident in mammalian cells [ 49 ] . In addition to protein phosphorylation , CFL - 1 activity is also ablated by intracellular pH that is regulated by a sodium - proton exchanger on the cell membrane . CFL - 1 will dissociate from cortactin or phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) at higher pH , and the inhibitory effect on CFL - 1 by these molecules will be removed [ 49 ] . Moreover , the subcellular localization of CFL - 1 , and regulation of actin dynamics by other AAPs such as profilin , tropomyosin and Aip1 will also directly or indirectly affect the activity of CFL - 1 [ 39 ] . 2 . 2 . The Putative Role of CFL - 1 in the Cell Nucleus As one of the AAPs , CFL - 1 is very different from others because it contains nuclear localization signals ( NLS ) in the protein sequence . This endows a particular ability of CFL - 1 to bind and carry depolymerized actin to nucleus [ 50 , 51 ] . The NLS fragment of CFL - 1 has been demonstrated to be functional when it is linked to nonnuclear proteins expressed in myotubes [ 51 ] . Recently , it was found that a conserved bipartite NLS , that is , two basic rich regions separated by seven amino acids ( 21 - RKSSTPEEVKKRKK - 34 ) played the functional role in mediating the nuclear localization of CFL - 1 through the classic importin α / β interaction pathways [ 51 , 52 ] . When cells are faced with heat shock , ATP - depletion and dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) treatment , cytochalasin D or high cytosolic G - actin concentration , CFL - 1 can translocate actin into nucleus and form actin rod - like structure [ 51 , 53 – 56 ] . Although the biological function of nuclear translocation of cofilin / actin is unclear , it may reduce the consumption of cellular energy because the ATP utilization in actin dynamics is tremendous . Sequestration of actins by cofilin in the nucleus would reduce actin dynamics in stressful condition and save cellular energy [ 57 ] . Although the dephosphorylated form of cofilin is essential for nuclear entry under these conditions , Nagaoka et al . have proposed that exogenous phosphorylated cofilin ( S3D ) is able to diffuse into the cell nucleus [ 58 ] . Our recent report also agrees that phosphorylatable , wild - type CFL - 1 can be detected in cell nuclei by the tetracycline inducible gene over - expression system [ 25 ] . Of interest , a recent report showed that phosphorylated cofilin can transit from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in the laminar formation of the chicken optic tectum , indicating that phospho - cofilin plays a role in neural development biology [ 59 ] . On the other hand , it has been proposed that CFL - 1 is phosphorylated in the nucleus by nuclear LIMK1 and LIMK2 [ 60 , 61 ] . Phosphorylated CFL - 1 will be inactivated to depolymerize actin filaments , and nuclear actin rods are formed . A recent report has indicated that fluid shear stress can activate nuclear LIMK1 / 2 to phosphorylate cofilin in the nucleus and result in actin realignment for endothelial barrier integrity [ 62 ] . Moreover , the cell cycle regulator p57 kip2 can bind to LIMK1 , but not LIMK2 , and translocate to the nucleus to reorganize actin fibers [ 63 ] . These mechanisms account for the importance of activated LIMK1 / 2 on the formation of phospho - CFL - 1 in the cell nucleus . A summary of nuclear entry of cofilin via various stresses is represented in Figure 1 . Taken together , the cytoplasm - nucleus transition of cofilin , either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated , is likely to play an essential role in various biological processes , and thus worthy of further investigation . Although actin itself does not contain an NLS , it is well known that actin is important for chromatin remodeling by binding to INO80 - associated chromatin modifying complexes [ 64 ] . Nuclear actin is also important for gene transcription by binding to RNA polymerase , promoting RNA processing and Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2015 , 16 4099 exporting mRNA to the cytoplasm [ 65 ] . It appears that ADF / cofilin may be an auxiliary molecule that transports actin to the cell nucleus for gene expression . The cytoplasmic ADF / cofilin may also influence gene expression via a nuclear actin independent pathway . For instance , ADF / cofilin - mediated actin turnover can promote the release of actin - bound nuclear transcription cofactors , such as the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) and serum response factor ( SRF ) - associated cofactor . Moreover , it has been reported that actin depolymerizing factor 9 ( ADF9 ) of Arabidopsis controls the gene expression and muticellular development of plants [ 66 ] . We have performed a microarray analysis for mRNA and microRNA expression before and after induction of exogenous CFL - 1 in human lung cancer cells , and we found many genes involved in cell cycle progression , amino acid metabolism , tumor suppression and even DNA damage response ( DDR ) are affected by over - expressed CFL - 1 ( unpublished data ) . Because CFL - 1 does not contain a DNA binding domain , it is believed that the effects of CFL - 1 on gene transcription would be indirect . Figure 1 . Nuclear entry of Cofilin - 1 ( CFL - 1 ) via various stresses . ( A ) CFL - 1 can bind G - actin and translocate to the nucleus to form actin rods by different exogenous and endogenous stresses . 1 . 10 % DMSO treatment ; 2 . Increase of G - actin concentration ; 3 . Neural degenerative diseases ; 4 . Heat shock stress ; 5 . ATP depletion . This action may avoid energy expenditure and promote chromatin remodeling via actin ; ( B ) Enforced expression of CFL - 1 can also occur in the nucleus . In this situation , phosphorylated CFL - 1 is also detectable in nucleus , while the mechanism of nuclear entry of phospho - CFL - 1 remains unclear . Because LIM kinase 1 ( LIMK1 ) and LMK2 are responsible for CFL - 1 phosphorylation in various cell types , the subcellular location of these kinases would determine the mechanisms of nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated CFL - 1 and regulate actin dynamics in the cytosol and nucleus . Nuclear entry of ADF / cofilin is usually induced by environmental stress . As mentioned , DMSO has long been known to trigger the nuclear entry of cofilin - actin complexes to form actin rods [ 54 ] . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2015 , 16 4100 Additionally , heat - shock stress can induce nuclear translocation of CFL - 1 through the NLS [ 24 , 52 ] . Formation of cofilin / actin rods in the nuclei and cytosol has also been detected in neural degenerative diseases including Huntington’s disease ( HD ) and Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) , respectively [ 67 , 68 ] . In neurodegenerative diseases , actin cytoskeletal regulation through cofilin is believed to be critical for the pathological etiology of these aging or stress related disorders [ 69 ] . Therefore , nuclear translocation of CFL - 1 may play an important role in degenerative diseases . Whether this biological behavior of CFL - 1 is to form specific actin - rod structures in the nucleus or to influence chromatin remodeling for gene expression is of interest for further study . 3 . Genotoxicity and DNA Damage Response ( DDR ) DNA damage can be induced by various environmental stresses , including ionizing radiation ( IR ) , oxidative stress , ultraviolet ( UV ) light , and even polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cigarettes . These genotoxicities cause different types of DNA damage followed by initiation of corresponding DNA repair systems . Additionally , DNA damage also triggers cell cycle checkpoints and initiates signaling pathways leading to apoptosis , senescence and even autophagy [ 70 , 71 ] . The elegant intracellular signaling networks activated by genotoxicity to determine the fate of insulted cells , such as cell cycle arrest , premature senescence , and apoptosis , is collectively termed the DNA damage responses ( DDR ) . Because of the cell heterogeneity , the DDR in each single cell of one population may be different . For instance , the survival fraction is commonly used to determine the cell tolerance to genotoxicity , and this is one example of the evidence of cell heterogeneity [ 72 , 73 ] . Ionizing radiation induced cell death is usually caused by unrepairable DNA damage . A functional DNA repair system would increase viability of irradiated cells , although it may leave errors in the DNA sequence and lead to mutation . Here we primarily focus on the ionizing radiation induced DDR and the potent effect on clinical radiotherapy [ 74 ] . 3 . 1 . Types of Ionizing Radiation on Cell Survival and DDR Ionizing radiation is generated by either high - energy photons or particles that can eject electrons or break the nucleus of the atom . Thus , the incident energy is to “ionize” charged particles that are originally bound in the atom , including secondary electrons and recoiled protons . X - ray and γ - rays belong to electromagnetic radiation with photon properties , while α particles and β particles belong to particulate radiation that can carry either a positive or negative charge . X - rays and γ - rays are regarded sparse types of radiation because they can easily penetrate through the object and only deposit little energy in it . On the other hand , α particles and protons are dense types of radiation that have difficulty to penetrate the object but can deposit large amounts of energy in it . X - rays and γ - rays can only generate ionized fast electron , which has the mass 1 / 2000 and 1 / 8000 of proton and α particle , respectively . Therefore , it is easy to understand that particulate radiation usually causes higher biological damage than electromagnetic radiation . X - rays and γ - rays generate fast electrons that can interact with water to generate free radicals that is the source of oxidative stress to damaged DNA . This is a so - called indirect effect . On the contrary , protons and α particles can directly deposit their energy on DNA even though they can also generate oxidative stress , and this is called a direct effect . Both effects are sufficient to break the covalent bonds of DNA and result in DNA double strand breaks ( DSB ) , but the levels are more severe by protons or α particles than by X - rays and γ - rays under the same absorbed dosage . The levels of DSB are reflected Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2015 , 16 4101 through measuring the survival fractions which represent the tolerance of cells to different types of radiation . The lower survival fraction caused by particulate radiation is related to complex DNA damage that is difficult to be repaired . The survival curve is drawn according to the survival fractions corresponding to increased radiation dose . In a semi - log plot of survival curve , α particles or protons usually exhibit a linear curve that stands for exponential killing , but X - rays and γ - rays will give a “shoulder” at lower doses before the appearance of the exponential killing curve . The “shoulder” region of the survival curve indicates that at low dose radiation , cells would repair effectively after irradiation by X - rays and γ - rays . However , there is no , or a very narrow , shoulder of survival curve observed using α particles or proton irradiation under the same dose . A scheme represents the effects of radiation types on DDR and survival curves are shown in Figure 2 . Figure 2 . Effects of different radiation types on DNA damage and cell survivals . Particulate radiations by α - particles or protons belong to densely ionizing radiation type because they can deposit most energy on their tracks . On the other hand , X - rays and γ - rays possess high penetration ability but leave little energy on the traveling track , so that they are sparsely ionizing radiation . Moreover , sparsely ionizing radiation mainly ionizes water to produce free radicals , which are highly electrophilic and prone to capture electrons from biological components . When DNA locates on the track of these two different radiation types , it displays different levels of damage . Densely ionizing radiation causes more double strand breaks than sparsely ionizing radiation , so that DNA repair will be accordingly less efficient . Under the same dosage , the survival fractions of particulate radiation irradiated cells will be lower than that of X - ray or γ - ray irradiated cells . 3 . 2 . DNA Repair Mechanisms Following Ionizing Radiation ( IR ) DNA double - strand breaks ( DSB ) are the major type of DNA damage after exposure to ionizing radiation . DSB damage needs to be repaired to maintain genomic stability and survival . In mammalian Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2015 , 16 4102 cells , the DNA repair mechanisms include nonhomologous end joining ( NHEJ ) and homologous recombination repair ( HRR ) , in which different DNA DSB repair proteins are involved . The key molecules for NHEJ include DNA end binding proteins Ku70 / Ku80 heterodimer , which in turn binds and enhances DNA - dependent protein kinase ( DNA - PKcs ) activity [ 75 – 78 ] . Artemis protein , an exonuclease involved in V ( D ) J recombination for immunological responses , can gain endonuclease activity after joining a complex with DNA - PKcs to process the broken end of DNA after IR . Finally , the DNA ends are filled in and connected through DNA polymerase λ / μ and PNK / XRCC4 / DNA ligase IV / XLF complex , respectively . This error - prone repair system mainly occurs in G0 , G1 and early S phase because no replicative template is required for repairing DSB [ 79 ] . For HRR , E . coli recombinase RecA - homologous protein Rad51 and its interacting partner Rad52 are important for single - strand DNA binding , strand exchange , and annealing using the sister chromatid as the repair template [ 80 – 83 ] . The strand exchange or invasion is assisted by BRCA1 / 2 tumor suppressor proteins , and Rad54 is a helicase that can hydrolyze ATP to unwind the double - strand DNA in template . After completion of repair , the tangled DNA structures , so called Holiday junctions , are resolved by MMS4 / MUS81 hetermodimer with endonuclease activity . Overall , this is an error - free repair system that is believed to be involved in late S and the G2 phase of the cell cycle . Deficiency of Ku70 or Ku80 , or inhibition of Rad51 levels can lead to enhancement of radiosensitivity [ 78 , 84 – 86 ] . Moreover , over - expression of Rad52 confers resistance to ionizing radiation in mammalian cells [ 87 ] . Therefore , cell radiosensitivity is strongly associated with DNA repair capacity [ 86 , 88 – 90 ] . Increased cell radiosensitivity by repressing DNA repair capacity is one of the important strategies for design of radiosensitizers . 3 . 3 . The Role of the Mre11 - Rad50 - NBS1 ( MRN ) Complex in Sensing IR - Induced DNA Damage Although NHEJ and HRR utilize different molecules to directly execute the re - joining of broken DNA ends , they have the DSB sensor in common . The MRN complex comprised by Mre11 ( meiotic recombination 11 ) , Rad50 and NBS1 ( Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 ) is reported to recognize the sites of DSB to trigger both NHEJ and HRR [ 91 ] . The MRN complex is also known to maintain the integrity of telomeres of chromosomes in eucaryotic cells [ 92 ] . Mre11 can specifically bind to DSB termini and perform single - strand DNA ( ssDNA ) endonuclease and 3 ' to 5 ' double - strand DNA ( dsDNA ) exonuclease activities [ 93 ] . Rad50 can bind to Mre11 and form a core tetramer complex in vivo [ 94 ] . Rad50 can unwind dsDNA in DSB ends by hydrolyzing ATP [ 95 ] . NBS1 does not contain enzymatic activity , but is important for transport oft he MRN complex into the nucleus [ 96 ] . It also mediates the DNA repair response by promoting protein - protein interaction at DSB sites . Importantly , both NBS1 and Rad50 can be phosphorylated by Ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) serine / theronine kinase for intra - S phase checkpoint and repair in response to IR [ 97 – 99 ] . However , ATM mediated phosphorylation of the MRN complex does not guide the MRN complex to DSB termini . On the contrary , this phosphorylation is required to recruit ATM to DSB termini for further activity . Binding of the MRN complex to DSB sites is important for both classical NHEJ ( C - NHEJ ) and alternative NHEJ ( A - NHEJ , without XRCC4 , Ku , and DNA - PKcs activity ) because knockdown of Mre11 can impair both pathways [ 100 ] . Furthermore , the MRN complex is also essential for processing DSB termini for Rad51 / Rad52 binding in HRR . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2015 , 16 4103 3 . 4 . Ignition of DDR by Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated ( ATM ) Kinase ATM is a member of phosphatidylinosital 3 - kinase related kinase ( PIKKs ) superfamily that also includes ATR ( ATM - and Rad3 - related ) , DNA - PKcs , mTOR ( target of rapamycin ) , SMG1 ( suppressor with morphological effect on genitalia ) , and TRRAP ( transformation / transcription domain - associated protein ) . Recruitment of ATM to DSB is dependent on MRN complex , although this DSB sensor may be not required for C - NHEJ under low dose or low - LET irradiation [ 101 , 102 ] . ATM has been regarded a transducer following the MRN complex that functions as a sensor of DSB [ 103 , 104 ] . In addition to the DSB site , genotoxicity - induced chromatin relaxation around DSB is also important for activation of ATM . The chromatin surrounding DSB will be modified by PARP - 1 ( poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase 1 ) that introduces poly ( ADP - ribose ) chains ( PAR chains ) to histone H1 and histone H2B [ 105 , 106 ] . Several chromatin remodeling molecules including PcG ( polycomb group ) , NuRD ( nucleosome remodeling deacetylase ) , ALC1 ( amplified in liver cancer 1 ) , and HP1 / - KAP - 1 ( H3 - trimethyl K9 binding protein 1 - KRAB associated protein 1 ) will interact with PARylated chromatin encompassing DSB for further processes [ 107 – 110 ] . These chromatin relaxation procedures mainly promote posttranslational modification of DSB and histones through ubiquitination , stabilization of chromatin structure , and unpacking of heterochromatic DSB [ 109 – 112 ] . ATM is also PARylated and activated by PARP1 after IR - induced DSB . Inhibition of PARP1 reduces ATM activity and DNA repair capacity , and it has been considered for design of cancer radiotherapeutic strategy [ 113 , 114 ] . Over 700 protein targets have been identified as phosphorylated by ATM and / or ATR after genotoxic treatment according to large - scale proteomic screening and analysis [ 115 – 117 ] . ATM itself is the substrate of this protein , and serine 1981 , 367 and 1893 ( ser1981 , ser367 , ser1893 ) are the autophosphorylation residues after IR - induced DSB [ 118 ] . As mentioned , the MRN complex is important for recruitment of ATM to the DSB sites . The lack of a MRN complex leads to the reduction of ser1981 phosphorylation and activity of ATM . The phosphorylation kinetics of ser1893 is slower than that of ser1981 of ATM . ATM phosphorylation on ser1893 , unlike ser1981 , fully depends on the MRN complex . This may explain the different phosphorylation kinetics between these two serines on ATM [ 118 ] . Activated ATM at DSB termini will further phosphorylate H2AX ( γ - H2AX ) , NBS1 , BRCA1 ( breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein ) , MDC1 ( mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 ) and SMC1 ( structural maintenance of chromosome 1 ) to promote DNA repair [ 119 , 120 ] . It is noteworthy that MDC1 can bind both γ - H2AX and NBS1 to cooperatively increase ATM activity for formation of γ - H2AX over megabases surrounding DSB sites [ 121 – 123 ] . 53BP1 is a scaffold for DSB responsive factors , and can be phosphorylated by ATM to increase the substrate - specificity of ATM [ 124 – 126 ] . When ATM is not bound to DSB sites , it can phosphorylate p53 and Chk1 / 2 to influence cell cycle checkpoint and apoptosis . Therefore , ATM is a critical center for DDR in response to genotoxicity . Recruitment and autophosphorylation of ATM at the DSB site after IR damage requires further activation to maintain the ATM activity for substrate phosphorylation . That is , ATM needs to be further modified by other mechanisms in addition to phosphorylation . The histone acetyltransferase ( HAT ) Tip60 is recruited and bound to ATM by the MRN complex in response to DSB [ 127 , 128 ] . Tip60 can acetylate ATM at lys3016 and is required for ATM - mediated phosphorylation on H2AX , p53 and Chk2 [ 118 ] . Tip60 is further activated by c - Abl tyrosine kinase at the DSB site [ 128 , 129 ] . Additionally , Tip60 is strictly controlled by ATF2 ( Activating Transcription Factor 2 ) , a bifunctional transcription Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2015 , 16 4104 factor that can promote Tip60 ubiquitination via E3 ubiquitin ligase Cul3 and proteasomal degradation to influence global DSB repair [ 130 ] . Knockdown of ATF2 can stabilize Tip60 and lead to activation of ATM and increase cell survival after IR damage [ 131 ] . On the other hand , ATM can phosphorylate ATF2 on ser490 / ser498 and confer the transcription - independent activity of ATF2 that can bind to γ - H2AX and MRN complex for S phase checkpoint [ 130 ] . Under this condition , inhibition of ATF2 leads to loss of S phase checkpoint and reduction of DNA repair capacity as well as ATM activity . Interestingly , Ser490A / ser498A phospho - mutant ATF2 cannot influence Tip60 stability after over - expression . This implies that ATM will negatively regulate its own activity by phosphorylating ATF2 to ablate Tip60 , which may occur after DNA repair is completed . The interplay between c - Abl - Tip60 and ATF2 would be essential to regulate ATM activity after they are recruited to DSB following IR [ 129 , 132 , 133 ] . A scheme of DNA damage - induced molecular responses for DSB repair is shown in Figure 3 . Figure 3 . DNA damage - induced molecular responses for DNA repair . In response to ionizing radiation , DNA double strand breaks ( DSB ) and chromatin relaxation surrounding DSB sites will occur . The MRN complex can sense and bind to DSB sites and quickly recruit ATM kinase for autophosphorylation and paraphosphorylation to various molecules , including NBS1 and Rad50 in the MRN complex . In addition , chromatin relaxation will activate PARP1 to execute PARylation on chromatin associated molecules and ATM kinase . Activated ATM needs to be maintained by acetylation via HAT Tip60 , which is negatively regulated by the ATF2 - Cul3 protein degradation pathway . Although c - Abl kinase can activate Tip60 at the DSB site , how DSB interacts with c - Abl is unclear . Additionally , whether MRN complex will regulate Tip60 to sustain ATM activity is unknown . ATM also regulates ATF2 activity , and it is likely to be an autoregulatory mechanism of ATM activity . Activated ATM can phosphorylate SMC1 , NBS1 , BRCA1 , MDC1 , 53BP1 , and H2AX to localize DSB sites for further DSB repair mechanisms , including HRR and NHEJ . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2015 , 16 4105 4 . Actin Dynamics , ADF / cofilin and DDR Although genotoxicity is meant to disrupt DNA structures , accumulated literature suggest that the genotoxicity induced DDR is not only associated with DNA breaking itself but also the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton [ 134 – 136 ] . The expression and activity of AAPs are of interest to be investigated because their activity and / or subcellular distribution are affected by genotoxicity . These effects largely influence DDR , including apoptosis and cell cycle progression by interacting with other DNA damage induced molecules , such as the p53 tumor suppressor protein . Notably , destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton using ATTs or deliberate manipulation of AAP expression can also modulate genotoxicity - induced DDR . In this section , how actin dynamics and AAPs play a role in response to DNA damage will be discussed . 4 . 1 . Actin Response Following DNA Damage DNA damage can induce actin reorganization that influences apoptosis and cell cycle arrest subsequently . For instance , use of synchrotron radiation X - ray scattering , actin in solutions of purified calf spleen actin will polymerize without a lag phase [ 137 ] . Induction of transient actin polymerization and later actin depolymerization in HL - 60 cells is important for ultraviolet ( UV ) irradiation or etoposide - induced apoptosis [ 138 ] . Of interest , cytolethal distending toxins ( CDTs ) , a protein toxin generated by Gram - negative bacteria , are able to induce DNA damage and promote the formation of actin stress fibers [ 139 ] . However , the formed stress fibers are due to RhoA GTPase activation , which is mediated by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) , so - called neuroepithelioma transforming gene 1 ( Net1 ) , that also promotes the p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway to extend cell survival [ 139 ] . This effect partially suggests that chronic exposure of genotoxicity will lead to genomic instability and mutation . Actin polymerization induced by DNA damage is also associated with p53 . It has been reported that LIMK2b , a potent tumor suppressor , is induced by p53 to modulate actin dynamics for executing G2 / M arrest through cofilin phosphorylation after DNA damage [ 140 ] . On the other hand , p53 mediated transaction of RhoC - LIMK2 leads to inactivation of cofilin , which reduces the actin depolymerization and leads to an increase of actin stress fibers . Under this condition , enhanced actin cytoskeletal formation promotes cell survival , and the efficacy of DNA damage - related therapy will be compromised [ 136 ] . The combination of a LIMK2 inhibitor and genotoxic therapy has potential for cancer treatment because it is impossible to inhibit p53 to prevent radio - chemoresistance of cancer cells . It appears that different splicing variants of LIMK2 transactivated by p53 would lead to distinct cell fates , and it requires careful investigation to clarify the effects of actin cytoskeletal remodeling mediated by the p53 - LIMK2 pathway . In another aspect , DNA damage - induced actin polymerization also negatively regulates p53 function by localizing p53 in the cytoplasm [ 135 ] . This effect may delay p53 mediated apoptotic processes and allow DNA repair to be processed before apoptosis . Indeed , it has been reported that polymerized actin is required for DSB repair [ 141 ] . Binding of p53 to actin filaments is calcium dependent , and the interaction between these two entities is enhanced by DNA damage [ 142 ] . On the other hand , p53 mediated gene transcription is also dependent on actin polymerization . A G - actin binding protein , so - called junction - mediated and regulatory protein ( JMY ) is released from polymerized actin Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2015 , 16 4106 following DNA damage . The free JMY containing a bipartite NLS enters the nucleus and interacts with p53 to enhance its transcriptional activity for DDR [ 134 , 143 ] . The potent actin cytoskeletal responses to DDR are summarized in Figure 4 . Figure 4 . Regulatory mechanisms of actin dynamics in response to DNA damage . ( A ) Radiation - induced actin polymerization triggers the release of JMY from G - actin . JMY then enters the nucleus and binds to p53 for p53 - dependent apoptosis ; ( B ) When DNA damage occurs , polymerized actins may allow p53 binding to actin filaments and retain p53 in the cytoplasm . DNA repair would dominate p53 - mediated apoptosis under this condition ; and ( C ) DNA damage - mediated actin polymerization would be caused by p53 induction of the Rho / RCOK signaling pathway , followed by activation of LIMK2 to phosphorylate and inactivate cofilin . The actin depolymerization rate will be reduced to maintain polymerized actins . 4 . 2 . DDR Following Destabilization of the Actin Cytoskeleton Since DNA damage promotes actin polymerization for subsequent biological responses , it is speculated that destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton will influence DDR [ 141 ] . Because the actin cytoskeleton is a dynamic structure , forced polymerization or depolymerization of actin will lead to destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton . Additionally , insufficient energy flux will impair nucleotide exchange of monomeric actin , a rate - limiting step of actin dynamics , to destabilize the actin cytoskeleton . Actin targeting toxins ( ATTs ) are extracted from fungi or sea sponges , and the biochemical functions of actin filaments are different among these ATTs ( Table 1 ) . Cytochalasin D ( CD ) has been reported to disrupt actin microfilaments and activate p53 , which causes G1 - to - S phase arrest and Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2015 , 16 4107 apoptosis [ 15 ] . It is unclear whether CD - induced p53 activity is the primary or secondary effect of microfilamental disruption since p53 up - regulation is largely dependent on DNA damage . On the other hand , disruption of actin filaments by cytochalasin B ( CB ) , CD , and latrunculin B ( LB ) can induce cell cycle regulator p21 CIP1 / WAF in p53 - null cells [ 144 ] . Interestingly , actin inhibitors - induced p21 CIP1 / WAF can be detected before p53 activation in p53 - wild - type cells , suggesting that disruption of actin filaments by actin inhibitors would affect cell growth without DNA damage . Disruption of actin filaments using Rho inhibitors or actin inhibitors also increases p21 CIP1 / WAF protein stability , which has been reported to be caused by activation of the c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) stress activated protein kinase ( SAPK ) pathway [ 145 ] . Additionally , disruption of the actin cytoskeleton can activate the JNK pathway via the mammalian Ste20 - like ( MST ) kinase , which can stabilize the p21 CIP1 / WAF via a JNK dependent phosphorylation on Thr57 [ 146 ] . MST kinase actually is required for stabilization of p21 CIP1 / WAF after disruption of the actin cytoskeleton . Therefore , it is of interest to further investigate whether disruption of the actin cytoskeleton increased p21 CIP1 / WAF stability via the MST - JNK pathway is also independent of p53 . Table 1 . The sources and functions of various actin inhibitors . Actin Inhibitors Source / Host Function Cytochalasin B ( CB ) Helminthosporium dematioideum / fungi Blocking monomer add - on at the fast - growing end of actin filament Cytochalasin D ( CD ) Zygosporium mansonii / fungi Blocking monomer add - on at the fast - growing end of actin filament , 10 - fold more potent than CB Latrunculin A Latrunculia magnifica / Red Sea Sponge Formation of a 1 : 1 complex with monomeric G - actin ( K d = 200 nM ) Misakinolid A ( Bistheonellide A ) Theonella sp . / marine sponge Inhibits actin polymerization by forming a 1 : 2 complex with G - actin Mycalolide B Mycale sp . / marine sponge Severs F - actin and forms a 1 : 1 complex with G - actin to sequester it ; it also suppresses actin - activated myosin Mg 2 + - ATPase activity Swinholide A Theonella swinhoei / marine sponge Sequestering actin dimers with a binding stoichiometry of 1 : 1 , and rapidly severing F - actin Jasplakinolide Jaspis johnstoni / marine sponge A potent inducer of actin polymerization and stabilization in vitro , cell - permeable Phalloidin Amanita phalloides / fungi A potent and specific F - actin binding agent ; Inhibitor of F - to G - actin conversion , cell non - permeable Morphological change is one of the most important characteristics of apoptosis induced by DNA damage . Disruption of actin microfilaments or microtubules has been reported to accelerate actinomycin D ( AD ) - induced DNA damage and apoptosis , but forced stabilization of these cytoskeletons has no such effects [ 147 ] . Pretreatment of cells with latrunculin or CD followed by ionizing radiation shows that the NHEJ - related proteins Ku70 / Ku80 are reduced to bind to the DNA ends caused by IR [ 141 ] . Jasplakinolide ( JP ) , an actin stabilizing reagent , has been reported to exhibit an additive effect to radiation - treated prostate cancer cell lines [ 148 ] . We have used the colony formation assay , a gold standard of radiobiological research to investigate the effects of CB and latrunculin A ( LA ) on radiosensitivity . The data revealed that LA but not CB could enhance radiosensitivity [ 25 ] . Cellular Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2015 , 16 4108 γ - H2AX is induced by radiation combining CB but not LA , suggesting that LA - mediated destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton would interfere with H2AX phosphorylation induced by IR [ 25 ] . Additionally , LA and CD have been reported to increase the level of ser - 3 phosphorylated cofilin [ 149 ] , whereas we found that CB did not show this ability . Whether actin inhibitors influence the expression of certain AAPs to influence DDR is of interest to further investigate . 4 . 3 . AAPs and DDR Actin dynamics are ablated by a variety of AAPs . Although AAPs regulate actin organization in the cytoplasm , accumulated literature has demonstrated that several AAPs can shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus to promote the formation of nuclear actin polymers and / or affect gene transcription . Moreover , they are important for the DNA repair system . Human actin - related proteins 5 ( hArp5 ) predominantly localizes in the nucleus and associates with chromatin remodeling molecules INO80 to promote DNA repair through accumulation of γ - H2AX [ 150 – 152 ] . JMY also exists in both the cytoplasm and nucleus , while its level in the nucleus will increase following DNA damage [ 153 ] . Increase of JMY accumulation in the nucleus is actin dependent and required for p53 activation [ 143 ] . Filament A ( FLNA ) , alternatively named actin - binding protein 280 ( ABP - 280 ) , cross - links cortical actin filaments into a firm 3D structure . Interestingly , FLNA also binds DNA repair proteins BRCA1 / 2 for HRR [ 154 – 156 ] . Inhibition of FLNA can increase the radiosensitivity and chemosensitivity to IR and cisplatin , respectively [ 80 ] . The G - actin sequestering protein thymosine β 4 ( T β 4 ) can bind to Ku80 to regulate the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 [ 157 ] , though it is unclear whether this interaction is essential for DNA repair . Although the actin nucleator , neural Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) , has not been reported to be related to DDR , its activator , so - called non - catalytic region of tyrosine kinase adaptor protein 1 ( NCK1 ) can translocate to the nucleus to activate p53 [ 158 ] . Nuclear NCK1 also associates with the suppressor of cytokine signaling 7 ( SOCS7 ) and G - actin to influence actin cytoskeletal reorganization in response to DNA damage [ 158 ] . 4 . 4 . ADF / Cofilin and DDR The effects of CFL - 1 on DNA repair and radiosensitivity have been previously established . Over - expression of wild - type , S3A and S3D mutant CFL - 1 all lead to enhanced radiosensitivity , but ρ - activated kinase ( ROCK ) inhibitor Y27632 does not increase radiosensitivity of treated cells [ 25 ] . Interestingly , γ - H2AX could not be detected in CFL - 1 over - expressing cells after irradiation , whereas the ATM activity was not affected under this condition . Therefore , we hypothesize that over - expressed CFL - 1 may enter the nucleus and hamper recognition of H2AX by ATM kinase , and this phenomenon would lead to failure of DNA repair initiation ( Figure 5 ) . As mentioned , the actin inhibitor LA but not CB can induce both cofilin phosphorylation and enhanced radiosensitivity that is associated with impaired formation of γ - H2AX [ 25 ] . This observation implies that the phospho - state of CFL - 1 is involved in regulating the cellular radiosensivity . Because the phosphorylation of cofiln - 1 is directly controlled by the Rho - LIMK pathway and SSHL1 phosphatase , it will be better to elucidate the role of phosphorylated CFL - 1 on DNA repair and radiosensitivity by manipulating the expression of the LIMK and SSHL1 gene . On the other hand , Yan et al . reported that in radioresistant astrocytoma , CFL - 1 is one of the proteins up - regulated in patients [ 159 ] . However , we have previously found that the CFL - 1 level Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2015 , 16 4109 of human A549 lung adenocarcinoma is higher than that of H1299 cells [ 160 ] , which exhibit stronger radioresistance than A549 cells [ 161 ] . Our recent data using in vivo isolated breast cancer stem cells also exhibit lower CFL - 1 levels and higher radioresistance than parental breast cancer cells ( manuscript in preparation ) . Therefore , the association of CFL - 1 and radiation - induced DDR may be cell - or tissue - dependent . A global survey of CFL - 1 expression on different types of cancer sources would be essential to design the therapeutic strategy to utilize the cofilin signaling pathway for cancer radiotherapy . Figure 5 . The putative effects of over - expressed CFL - 1 on DNA repair . ( A ) Under normal condition , IR - induced DNA damage will trigger the activation of the ATM kinase , which phosphorylates H2AX encompassing DNA damage sites . 53BP1 will recognize γ - H2AX and recruit additional DNA repair molecules to fix the damaged DNA and lead to cell survival ; and ( B ) Over - expression of wild type CFL - 1 ( phosphorylatable ) may enter and locate around DNA . After IR , the ATM kinase remains to be activated , but cannot phosphorylate H2AX . Recruitment of 53BP1 to the γ - H2AX sites fails , so that the DNA repair capacity is impaired and results in cell death . 5 . Conclusions The cross - talk between the cytoplasm and nucleus is increasingly important in upcoming bio - research phases . The actin cytoskeleton and associated proteins , originally support cellular mechanical functions in the cytoplasm , and have been regarded as critical messengers and cofactors to modulate the extracellular and intracellular signaling to the nucleus , a sanctuary of eukaryotic cells to orchestrate cell responses . Although DDR is believed to be associated with the dynamic architecture of the cytoskeleton , Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2015 , 16 4110 the role of different AAPs on regulation of DDR following genotoxicity remain largely unknown . As a primary regulator of actin dynamics and an essential gene to ablate cell viability , CFL - 1 - mediated DDR is of interest to be investigated . At a minimum , several conflicting results from different research groups need to be clarified in the future . It is expected that these studies would define the role of actin - targeting agents for radiotherapy .
