Introduction Cells respond to internal and external cues by selectively permitting growth in speciﬁc regions of the cell membrane to achieve non - spherical shapes [ 1 ] . Studies have found that the actin cytoskeleton , a major target of signaling events , undergoes rear - rangement and mediates transport of proteins , organelles and secretory vesicles toward sites of growth , giving rise to polarized morphogenesis ( [ 2 , 3 ] , reviewed in [ 4 , 5 ] ) . In morphogenesis of yeast and mammalian cells , the organiza - tion of the actin cytoskeleton and vesicle transport along a vectorial axis requires an intricate regulation orchestrated by active G - proteins , Cdc42p and other GTPases , to control the establishment of polarity [ 3 , 6 , 7 ] . Activation of Cdc42p leads to a localized recruit - ment of actin cables and actin patches at the site of Cdc42p accumu - lation on the cell membrane ; however , the details of the pathways linking Cdc42p to actin polymerization are still unclear [ 8 ] . Since morphogenesis requires sustained assembly of actin cables , the maintenance of Cdc42p polarization and other cortical proteins is crucial . Three general schemes have been invoked to explain such polarization [ 4 ] : ( 1 ) a preexisting stably polarized ‘‘anchor’’ interacts with a protein of interest , thereby increasing its concentration ; for example , in yeast budding , ‘‘bud site selec - tion’’ proteins are deposited at the cell poles during bud formation , allowing them to serve as ’’landmarks’’ that bind anchor proteins in subsequent cell cycles [ 9 ] ; ( 2 ) a diffusion barrier is established that prevents protein diffusion between compartments ; in budding yeast , septin ﬁlament systems act as a diffusion barrier during bud - ding ; ( 3 ) dynamic control through polarized delivery and endocytic retrieval of cortical proteins to sites of polarization thereby limit - ing the length scale of lateral membrane diffusion . In yeast mating projection ( shmoo ) formation , a morphogenesis process in which no evident diffusion barrier has been found ( although the septin structure at the base of the projection may potentially act in this manner ) , endocytosis and exocytosis could play critical roles in both maintaining polarity and expanding the membrane to produce the projection , if the proteins and vesicles are kinetically recycled and fuse with the native membrane , leading to a change in the total area of cell membrane . In experiments of Saccharomyces cerevisiae exposed to differen - tial mating pheromone concentrations , different cell morphologies were observed . At high pheromone concentrations , mating projec - tions are observed to be thinner and shorter than those exposed to 0014 - 5793 / $ 36 . 00 ! 2012 Federation of European Biochemical Societies .

Previous studies suggest that endocytosis is a receptor - mediated process where binding of extra - cellular ligand by the extracellular portion of transmembrane receptors facilitates heterotrimeric G - protein activation and inter - nalization of the receptor – ligand complex [ 10 ] , and exocytosis reg - ulated by the intracellular signaling of Cdc42p [ 11 ] . This evidence leads us to propose that differential cell morphologies in response to ligand concentration are a result of the balance between endo - cytosis and exocytosis , in other words , a balance between G - protein and Cdc42p signaling . An efﬁcient way to test this hypothesis is to develop a mathe - matical model that incorporates the signaling transduction path - way and permits deformation of the cell membrane . A number of mathematical models have been developed to investigate dynam - ics of actin ﬁlaments in cell morphogenesis [ 12 , 13 ] . Different as - pects of actin dynamics , such as the actin monomer cycle and actin polymerization at the leading cell edge [ 14 ] , and roles of ves - icle trafﬁcking on signaling and polarization [ 15 , 16 ] , are inspected in various models . Fluid - based models are also used to simulate the motion or deformation of eukaryotic cells [ 17 – 19 ] . Level set approaches coupled with the associated biochemistry are used to approximate the deforming cell membrane [ 20 – 22 ] . In this paper , we propose a mathematical model that couples the signaling pathway and the deforming cell membrane . We will ﬁrst introduce a single - module model to demonstrate the capabil - ity of the model to generate budding and mating projections mor - phologies in yeast cells . Then we will explain the pheromone dependent experimental data by using a two - module model of G b c ( G - protein ) and Cdc42p signaling , whose levels correlate with levels of endocytosis and exocytosis . It is important to note that this division of labor between heterotrimeric G - protein and Cdc42 is a model hypothesis ( and simpliﬁcation ) that needs to be tested and reﬁned by further experiments . Nevertheless , numerical simulations show that different balances between G b c and Cdc42p signaling indeed result in differential cell length and width , and the cell morphologies are consistent with the experimental results both qualitatively and quantitatively . 2 . Materials and methods To investigate the morphological changes induced by yeast cell polarity , we use models consisting of polarization related species , with molecular membrane diffusion , reactions , and signal ampliﬁ - cation mechanisms described by the reaction – diffusion equations . The detailed description of the model equations , parameter selec - tion and numerical simulations are provided in Supplementary materials . Experimental details including yeast strains , imaging and microﬂuidic experiments are described in Supplementary materials . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Framework for modeling yeast cell morphological changes – a single - module model To study the cell morphological change induced by cell polariza - tion , we start with a simple single - module model consisting of two species a and b , in a domain describing the cell membrane that is subject to morphological changes . The species a represents a mem - brane associated protein undergoing polarization in response to an external or internal spatial cue , for example , Cdc42p in budding yeast . The other species b represents a global negative regulator of a , and is uniformly distributed throughout the cell , or can be per - ceivedasafastdiffusingspecies ( e . g . inhibitorofCdc42pactivation ) . The dynamics of a and b are governed by a reaction – diffusion system , Eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , in which the lateral surface diffusion , coop - erative production , positive feedback and degradation of a are included , while b regulates a through an integral feedback loop . The details of how each term models molecular mechanisms are described in Supplementary materials . @ a @ t ¼ D r 2 m a þ k 0 1 þ ð b u Þ % q þ k 1 1 þ ð c pa Þ % h % k 2 a % k 3 ba ; ð 1 Þ db dt ¼ k 4 ð ~ a % k ss Þ b ; ð 2 Þ ~ a ¼ R s a ds R s ds ; p ¼ 1 1 þ ð b u Þ % q : The domain of interest is the cross section of the cell membrane , which undergoes morphological changes and is essentially a closed curve of time dependent shape . With the point on the domain de - noted by x = z ( n , t ) e z + r ( n , t ) e r , where ( z , r ) is its Cartesian coordinate parameterized by n , and e z and e r the corresponding unit vectors , the motion of the domain is given by d x dt ¼ ð z t ; r t Þ ¼ V n ð x ; t Þ n þ T ð x ; t Þ s : ð 3 Þ In Eq . ( 3 ) , n is the outward normal vector of the membrane , with V n as the outward normal velocity , and s is the tangential direction of the membrane , with T a speciﬁed tangential velocity . The motion of the cell membrane will be dictated by V n , but not affected by T . Biologically , the velocity of cell growth in budding yeast de - pends on the rate of assembly and polarized organization of actin patches and actin cables . Both are concentrated at sites of polarized growth , and actin cables are thought to mediate polarized exocyto - sis , which contributes to the cell growth [ 23 , 24 ] . Evidence has been reported that Cdc42p regulates the polarized organization of actin patches and actin cables [ 5 , 8 ] . In this paper , we directly associate the growth velocity V n with the concentration of Cdc42p ( a ) , although other players may also be involved in the cell growth . Thus , V n is a function of a , and Eqs . ( 1 ) – ( 3 ) form a closed system describing the spatial dynamics of the proteins and the deforming domain . The details of the numerical simulation are provided in the Supplementary materials . In yeast cells , budding and mating projection formation require cell polarization and share many downstream structural and sig - naling pathways , yet each process results in dramatically different morphologies . Both initially grow from the tip ; however , budding becomes isotropic midway while the shmoo retains a constant pointing tip growth toward the source of stimulation [ 25 , 26 ] . In this section , we demonstrate the capability of the single - module model to capture both yeast morphologies using different parame - ters and , more importantly , different functions of velocity in Eq . ( 3 ) . Budding is initiated by a remnant cortical cue from the previous budding event that can be considered as an input , and represented by the spatially dependent function u in the equation . This internal cue induces polarization of proteins , such as Bud5 and Rsrl , which in turn transmits the signal downstream inducing the polarization of Cdc42 and other proteins . This ﬁrst recruitment stage can be modeled as the cooperativity k 0 term in Eq . ( 1 ) . It has been shown that Bem1 recruitment forms a positive feedback loop of Cdc42 recruitment and activation , corresponding to the positive feedback k 1 term in Eq . ( 1 ) . Inhibition of this Cdc42 activation has been shown to be mediated by Cla4 and is simply modeled as b in Eq . ( 2 ) , reviewed in [ 27 ] . We started exploring how those distinct morphologies can be obtained by characterizing the normal velocity V n ( x , t ) . Simulations revealed that when V n ( x , t ) is proportional to a , a growing bud can C . - S . Chou et al . / FEBS Letters 586 ( 2012 ) 4208 – 4214 4209 be successfully reproduced , Fig . 1A . Since the current model is a simplistic model created to demonstrate the moving boundary framework methodology , many details are omitted . In particular , we did not consider the bud neck formation or the septin mediated diffusion barrier in budding . Inclusion of additional pathway ele - ments would be required to achieve a continual bud formation that pinches off from the mother . A pheromone gradient serves as the input for mating projection formation , which is transduced through membrane receptors . This binding event can be modeled through the cooperativity k 0 term . The Cdc42 positive feedback loop , as in the budding , is mediated by Bem1 and Cdc24 , and inhibited by Cla4 . The simplistic model captures the basic spatial dynamics of cell polarization , as veriﬁed by the mass action model in [ 28 ] . The polarisome , which directs cytoskeleton dynamics and projection shape , is more tightly local - ized than its upstream activator Cdc42 . Therefore , we model the velocity of the cell membrane to be [ k ( n & d L ) a ] n , where k is a con - stant , taken as 0 . 02 , and d L is the unit vector along the direction of the external gradient . The appearance of n & d L is to model the fact that the cytoskeleton of localized and pointing to the tip of the shmoo . As a result , the simulation reproduces the shmoo shape as in Fig . 1B . Altogether , by deﬁning the velocity functions in biologically relevant terms we can replicate cellular morphology using our single - module model . In the following sections we will show a greater understanding of cell morphology dynamics through the incorporation of additional signaling pathway components into the velocity functions . 3 . 2 . Yeast mating projection morphologies are pheromone concentration dependent We observed that the morphology and growth rate of yeast mating projections toward a - factor pheromone gradients are dependent on the average mating factor concentration . Cells stim - ulated with high concentration of a - factor have thinner and short - er projections , while those in lower concentrations are wider and longer , both orient in a gradient dependent manner [ 29 ] . Fig . 2A shows the morphologies of cells treated with a range of a - factor concentrations ( 0 , 3 , 10 , 30 , 100 and 1000 nM ) after 3 h . From the images an inverse relation between pheromone concentration and the resulting mating projection width and length can be seen . The morphological differences of cells were quantiﬁed for sys - tematic investigation . Measurements are deﬁned as a comparison of cells before and after projection formation : cells imaged before and after pheromone stimulation were superimposed so the rear of the cells were aligned along the projected direction , as illus - trated in Fig . 2B . The diameter of the cell pre - stimulation was measured along projection axis ( length ) and perpendicular to the projection axis ( width ) . Projection width is deﬁned as the distance between the two points where the projection extends from the unstimulated cells perimeter and post - stimulation cell length as the distance from the cell’s rear to projection tip . Projection length was calculated by subtracting the pre - stimulation length from the post - stimulation length . To normalize across all cells , a ratio of the projection length or projection width and pre - stimulation cell diameter was calculated , Fig . 2C . 1 0 - 1 - 1 0 1 2 - 1 0 1 2 - 1 0 1 2 T = 10 T = 12 T = 13 T = 10 T = 12 T = 15 B udd i ng S h m oo A B - 1 0 1 2 - 1 0 1 2 - 1 0 1 2 1 0 - 1 Image Fig . 1 .

Yeast projection width and length are inversely related to pheromone concentration .

( C ) Statistics of projection length and width normalized by pre - stimulation cell diameter are compared after exposure to high and low concentrations of a - factor ( 10 nM , blue bars , n = 24 ; 30 nM , green bars , n = 24 ; 1000 nM , red bars , n = 24 ; there was a signiﬁcant difference between the 10 and 1000 nM data by t - test , P < 0 . 001 ) . 4210 C . - S . Chou et al . / FEBS Letters 586 ( 2012 ) 4208 – 4214 Statistics were calculated on 24 cells in a - factor of high ( 1000 nM ) , medium ( 30 nM ) and low ( 10 nM ) concentrations , with 1 nM / l m pheromone gradients applied to both . The cell length and width were measured after 3 - h exposure to a - factor . Fig . 2C shows the histograms of the experiments , with the lengths and widths scaled by the original diameters of the cell to eliminate the varia - tion of cell sizes in the sample . The average projection widths in low pheromone concentrations are signiﬁcantly greater than at high concentrations ( 0 . 84 , 0 . 65 and 0 . 58 , unit - less after scaling , P < 0 . 001 , two - tail Student t - test ) , and the averaged length is sig - niﬁcantly longer after exposure to low pheromone concentrations compared to high concentration ( 0 . 46 , 0 . 42 and 0 . 39 , P < 0 . 001 , two - tail Student t - test ) . While both the length and width of the projection depend on the pheromone concentration , the measure - ment reveals that the difference in cell width is more pronounced . Unlike some chemotactic cells such as Dictyostelium and neutro - phils , yeast cells are not motile . During mating the shape and over - all size of yeast change signiﬁcantly , and membrane surface area directly results from the ﬂux of bi - layer lipids via vesicular trafﬁck - ing , endocytosis and exocytosis . It has been reported that during mating projection formation , endocytosis and exocytosis do not take place in a uniform fashion around the cell membrane , but in - stead are polarized under the direction of localized signaling path - ways . Therefore it is possible that the net effect of the associated signals results in the morphology of the cell , and thus is deter - mined by the balance of the receptor and Cdc42p signaling . We hypothesize that differential shmoo morphology is a result of this balance between receptor - mediated endocytosis ( G - protein signaling ) and exocytosis ( Cdc42 signaling ) . Higher concentration of ligand results in more occupied receptors and higher G b c signal - ing . Projection growth at high concentrations occurs primarily at the tip , so we assumed that away from the tip , the endocytosis rate is approximately the same as the exocytosis rate . Since more receptors are occupied and G - protein signaling stronger , there is more endocytosis over the membrane which balances out the exo - cytosis . Net transport of vesicles is equivalent and focused at the tip resulting in projections that are shorter and thinner . Con - versely , in cells exposed to lower concentrations of pheromone , we hypothesize that the rate of endocytosis would be reduced be - cause there are fewer ligand - bound receptor molecules to be inter - nalized . We tested this hypothesis by measuring the uptake of the membrane dye FM4 - 64 at different concentrations of a - factor : 0 , 3 , 10 , and 100 nM ( Fig . 3A ) . Internalization of the dye was quanti - tated by ﬂuorometer ( details in Supplementary materials ) . We found that the rate of endocytosis increased as the pheromone dose increased . Although the difference between the data at 10 and 100 nM was modest , it was consistent with the expected trend . Therefore , at low a - factor , there will be more net transport of lipids . The hypothesized model to explain the pheromone concen - tration dependent shmoo differences experimentally observed is depicted in Fig . 3B . 3 . 3 . Two - module model linking G - protein cycles to vesicle trafﬁcking and morphology To explore the inﬂuence of signaling mediated vesicular traf - ﬁcking on cellular polarization and morphology , a model that incorporates both G b c and Cdc42p signaling cycles is required , Eqs .

The G b c cycle is described in the ﬁrst module , Eqs . ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , with its input the spatial gradient of a - factor denoted by u and its output the G b c signaling ( a i ) . The Cdc42p cycle , constituting the second module Eqs . ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , is downstream of the G b c cycle ( a 1 ) , which is the input , and the level of activated Cdc42p ( a 2 ) the output . Although the mat - ing pathway is far more complicated and consists of many more sig - naling species , this two - module model captures the main structure of the two cycles related to endocytosis and exocytosis , which di - rectly contributes to cell morphological change . The motion of the cell membrane remains described by Eq . ( 3 ) . Based on our hypothesis , the local normal velocity V n results from the net transport of vesicles through endocytosis and exocytosis , and therefore we assume that its magnitude is the net difference of exocytosis rate ( f EXO ) and endocytosis rate ( f ENDO ) , which takes the form of Eq . ( 8 ) : V n ð x ; t Þ ¼ ð f EXO % f ENDO Þ n : ð 8 Þ Since the endocytosis and exocytosis rate depends respectively on G b c and Cdc42 signaling , we model f ENDO as a function of a 1 and f EXO as a function of a 2 . In Eq . ( 8 ) , f EXO is simply taken as a linear proportion of a 2 . As for f ENDO , we assume that it depends on the le - vel of G b c ( a 1 ) as in Eq . ( 4 ) : if G b c signaling is below a threshold s , then the endocytosis is balanced by the exocytosis , namely , f ENDO = f EXO , if the G b c signaling is above that threshold , the endo - cytosis reaches a constant saturated state . This deﬁnition ensures that the total endocytosis does not exceed exocytosis , which ac - counts for the total increase of the lipid on the cell membrane . f EXO ð x ; t Þ ¼ q a 2 ð x ; t Þ ; ð 9 Þ f ENDO ð x ; t Þ ¼ f EXO ð x ; t Þ ; if a 1 ð x ; t Þ < s f EXO ð ~ x ; t Þ if a 1 ð x ; t Þ P s ! where a 1 ð ~ x ; t Þ ¼ s : ð 10 Þ The parameter s thus determines the balance between G b c and Cdc42 signaling , and thereby dictates the projection shape . As s in - creases , the area with a net ﬂux of membrane lipids becomes smal - ler , and therefore a larger s corresponds to the situation of higher a - factor concentration . We ﬁrst make a qualitative comparison of cell morphologies and the extent of polarization between experiments and simulations . Fig . 3C displays time - lapse images of active Cdc42 distribution visu - alized through the localization of its effector Ste20 tagged with GFP . The upper and lower panels correspond to experiments with 100 and 1000 nM a - factor , respectively . Within 10 min activated Cdc42 begins to localize to the front of the cell and is initially broadly distributed , Fig . 3C . Localization then becomes more fo - cused as the projection forms and extends . In Fig . 3D it can be seen in simulations of Cdc42 ( a 2 ) dynamics that higher concentration of pheromone ( larger s ) , results in a shorter and thinner shmoo . For both high and low pheromone concentrations , Cdc42 ﬁrst localizes , followed by a protrusion at the polarization site , and later Cdc42 localizes to the shmoo , encompassing almost the entire projection . C . - S . Chou et al . / FEBS Letters 586 ( 2012 ) 4208 – 4214 4211 These results are qualitatively consistent with the protein localiza - tion studies in Fig . 3C . In Fig . 4A , simulated cell morphologies resulting from three values of s , can be observed : as s decreases , the shmoo becomes wider and longer . These results , with the interpretation of s , again qualitatively agree with the observed pheromone concentration dependent morphologies in Fig . 2 . To make a quantitative comparison , one needs to deﬁne the length and width of the simulated projections . The computational framework used describes the motion of ﬁxed tracking points on the cell membrane , making the distance between tracking points over time easily measured . We deﬁne a tracking point as ﬁxed if its traveling distance is less than a threshold ( 10 % 8 units ) .

While the threshold for deﬁning ﬁxed points is adjustable and could potentially affect the measurements , our extensive numerical simulations ( data not shown ) suggest that the length and width are not sensitive to this threshold . With the above deﬁnition , we compare the results from three sets of parameters corresponding to low , medium and high phero - mone concentrations . Due to the deterministic nature of our model , one simulation for each set of parameters is presented as a histo - gram , Fig . 4B , for easy comparison with experimentally derived data in Fig . 2C . In Fig . 4B , the low concentration case is marked in blue , with the width 0 . 87 and the length 0 . 44 ( unit - less after scaled by the original cell diameter ) . The medium and high concentrations are colored in green and red respectively , with the corresponding widths 0 . 68 and 0 . 60 , and the lengths 0 . 39 and 0 . 34 . The data from our simulations are very close to the experimental measurements presented in Fig . 2C . The inverse relation between s and the shmoo lengths and widths is shown in Fig . 4C . 4 . Discussion We have presented mathematical models that incorporate both cellular membrane signaling and deforming cell membrane of yeast cells . Modeling the deformation of the cell membrane using our single - module model , the budding and shmoo morphologies can be reproduced . Two signaling systems , heterotrimeric G - pro - tein and Cdc42 , have previously been shown to be associated with endocytosis and exocytosis and we hypothesize that their oppos - ing inﬂuence on the membrane results in mating projection mor - phology . To test this theory in silico we developed a two - module model , based on the general framework representing G - protein and Cdc42 modules . Using the model we explain the interesting experimental observations in which mating projection morphology is affected by mating pheromone concentration . Our simulation re - sults were shown to be quantitatively consistent with the experi - mental measurements , which supports our hypothesis . This work has produced several biological insights . First , modu - lating the spatial dynamics of endocytosis and exocytosis can pro - duce signiﬁcantly different cell morphologies . Second , we provide modeling and experimental evidence that at higher a - factor doses , endocytosis is increased , leading to a thinner mating projection . Third , we construct a ﬁrst - generation modeling framework for describing cell morphology in terms of G - protein and Cdc42 signal - ing and their hypothesized effect on endocytosis and exocytosis . While the change of length and width of the shmoo appears to be a nonlinear function of a - factor concentrations , further investi - gation is needed to determine if there is a limit of a - factor effect . Finally , future work will seek to incorporate additional physical forces that drive projection formation such as the spatial distribu - tion of gain and loss of membrane lipid and role of actin network dynamics on vesicular trafﬁcking , morphology , signal propagation and ampliﬁcation .
