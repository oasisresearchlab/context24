Older Adults’ Help - Seeking Attitudes and Treatment Beliefs Concerning Mental Health Problems Corey S . Mackenzie , Ph . D . , Tiffany Scott , M . A . , Amber Mather , B . A . , Jitender Sareen , M . D . Objectives : Older adults with mental health problems are especially unlikely to seek professional mental health services . It is not clear , however , whether their help - seeking attitudes and treatment beliefs contribute to this problem . The objectives of this study were to compare older adults’ attitudes and beliefs to younger adults’ and to examine the influence of age on these variables after controlling for other demo - graphic variables , prior help - seeking , and mental disorders . Methods : The authors analyzed cross - sectional data from Part 2 of the National Comorbidity Survey Replication . This dataset includes 5 , 692 community - dwelling adults , including 1 , 341 adults who were 55 years of age and older . Participants responded to three questions assessing attitudes toward seeking professional mental health services and one question examining beliefs about the percentage of people with serious mental health concerns who benefit from professional help . The authors used logistic regression to predict positive versus negative attitudes and beliefs from age , gender , education , and race / ethnicity , as well as prior help seeking and mood and / or anxiety disorder diagnosis . Results : Overall , more than 80 % of participants exhibited positive help - seeking attitudes and more than 70 % reported positive treatment beliefs . In contrast to the modest effect of age on beliefs , adults 55 – 74 years of age were approximately two to three times more likely to report positive help - seeking attitudes than younger adults . Conclusions : Older adults’ positive attitudes and treatment beliefs are un - likely barriers to their use of mental health services . This finding , which is consistent with recent positive views of aging , suggests that enabling resources and need factors are more likely explanations for older adults’ low rates of mental health service use .

In contrast to these high rates of mental health prob - lems , these surveys have also highlighted strikingly low rates of mental health service use , with 65 % – 80 % of individuals with diagnosable mental health problems not receiving professional help . Despite evidence that mental health service utilization is on the rise , the majority of people with mental disorders still do not receive treatment . 3 Furthermore , certain demographic groups , notably older adults , remain especially unlikely to seek professional help . 4 , 5 Considerable attention has been directed to reduc - ing the tremendous gap between the need for and use of mental health services . Mental health commis - sions in both United States 6 and Canada 7 were re - cently created to provide recommendations for im - proving the mental health systems in these countries in general and for particular underserved segments of the population , including older adults . Anders - en’s 8 inﬂuential behavioral model of health service use suggests that decisions to seek help are deter - mined by people’s predispositions to use services ( e . g . , age , social support , and health beliefs ) , re - sources that enable or serve as barriers to use ( e . g . , health insurance , availability of therapists , and knowledge of how to access them ) , and their need for help . Application of this model to older adults’ men - tal health service use suggests that they are less likely than younger adults to perceive a need to seek help , 9 , 10 and less likely to have enabling resources such as access to properly trained geriatric mental health professionals and health insurance . 6 , 11 , 12 However , the inﬂuence of predisposing factors , such as help - seeking attitudes and treatment beliefs , on older adults’ use of services is less clear . This gap in knowledge is important to ﬁll for two reasons . First , there are strong theoretical foundations for the inﬂu - ence of attitudes and beliefs on behavior , including the motivation and opportunity as determinants of behavior ( mode ) model 13 and the theory of planned behavior . 14 Second , a large body of empirical evi - dence supports this theoretical work , indicating that beliefs and attitudes can be highly predictive of a variety of behaviors , 15 including whether or not in - dividuals seek psychiatric help . 16 , 17 Unfortunately , it is not clear at the present time whether and to what extent there are age differences in help - seeking attitudes and treatment beliefs . With respect to attitudes , stigma concerns are often cited as a signiﬁcant contributing factor to older adults’ underutilization of mental health services . 12 , 18 However , studies that have examined this issue empirically , albeit with small samples , suggest otherwise . 19 – 21 Also , certain studies have reported prevalent negative treatment beliefs among older adults , 22 whereas others have found that either no age differences exist in beliefs about the effectiveness of therapy 10 , 23 , 24 or that older adults have more pos - itive beliefs about taking psychotropic medication . 23 Two likely contributors to these discrepancies are small sample sizes that limit generalizability , and grouping adults 65 and older into one age category despite tremendous interindividual variability among older adults , including between young - old and old - old individuals . 25 The purpose of this study was to use a large , representative sample to examine differences in help - seeking attitudes and treatment beliefs across the lifespan , including adults aged 55 – 64 , 65 – 74 , and 75 (cid:2) . A secondary purpose was to explore the inﬂu - ence of age on attitudes and beliefs in the context of other related variables , including other sociodemo - graphic characteristics , previous help seeking , and psychiatric disorders . 26 , 27 We hypothesized , based on our review of the literature , that we would ﬁnd little variation in treatment beliefs across the lifespan and that age would be positively associated with help - seeking attitudes in both unadjusted models and after controlling for demographic , help - seeking , and mood / anxiety covariates . METHOD Sample Data came from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication ( NCS - R ) ; a nationally representative cross - sectional survey of American households be - tween February 2001 and April 2003 . Participants were English - speaking , non - institutionalized civil - ians aged 18 and older in the 48 coterminous states . The NCS - R had a response rate of 70 . 9 % and was administered in two parts . Part 1 was administered to all participants ( N (cid:3) 9 , 282 ) and included an as - sessment of core mental disorders . The current study is based on Part 2 of the survey , which was admin - Mackenzie et al . Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 16 : 12 , December 2008 1011 istered to a subsample of Part 1 participants ( N (cid:3) 5 , 692 ) and included an assessment of additional dis - orders as well as correlates of the core disorders including attitudes toward mental health service use and treatment beliefs . For a detailed description of the NCS - R , including the sample and weighting pro - cedures , see Kessler et al . 28 Measures The NCS - R assessed attitudes toward professional mental health services use with three questions . A willingness question inquired whether respondents would seek professional help if they had serious emotional problems ( four response options : would deﬁnitely go , probably go , probably not go , or deﬁ - nitely not go ) . A comfort question required respon - dents to indicate how comfortable they would feel talking about personal problems with a professional ( four response options : very , somewhat , not very , or not at all comfortable ) . Finally , respondents an - swered a stigma question regarding how embar - rassed they would be if their friends knew they were getting professional help for an emotional problem ( four response options : very , somewhat , not very , or not at all embarrassed ) . We reverse coded items , which can range from 1 to 4 , so that higher scores indicate more positive attitudes . We then dichoto - mized each attitude variable , enabling us to predict whether participants held positive attitudes ( e . g . , very or somewhat comfortable ) or negative attitudes ( e . g . , not very or not at all comfortable ) . Although dichotomizing variables reduces variance and statis - tical power to ﬁnd signiﬁcant effects , the large sam - ple size in the NCS - R mitigated this concern . We also created a composite variable by summing the raw scores of the three original attitude variables and then dichotomizing this score so that values of 3 – 7 represent overall negative attitudes and values of 8 – 12 indicate overall positive attitudes . The internal consistency of this three - item attitude composite is low ( (cid:2) (cid:3) 0 . 56 ) because alpha is constrained by the small number of items , especially when each mea - sures a distinct aspect of help - seeking attitudes . We retained this composite score given that : a ) low in - ternal consistency is expected under such circum - stances , b ) the composite has been used in previous research , 16 , 27 and c ) results using it were consistent with ﬁndings across the three items that comprise it . Belief regarding the usefulness of professional mental health services was assessed with the ques - tion : “Of the people who see a professional for seri - ous emotional problems , what percent do you think are helped ? ” Participants could respond to this ques - tion with any number from 0 % to 100 % . We coded responses to this question into positive ( belief that 50 % or more will beneﬁt from professional help ) versus negative ( belief that less than 50 % will bene - ﬁt ) beliefs . Dichotomizing responses in this way was justiﬁed by the fact that the normally distributed responses ranged from 0 to 100 , with a mean of 52 . 37 ( SD : 24 . 01 ) and a median score of 50 . With respect to demographic characteristics , age was our primary predictor variable of interest . We divided age into seven categories ( i . e . , 18 – 24 , 25 – 34 , 35 – 44 , 45 – 54 , 55 – 64 , 65 – 74 , and 75 (cid:2) ) to ensure ade - quate sensitivity to detect nonlinear changes in atti - tudes and beliefs across the lifespan , including dif - ferences between young - old and old - old individuals . We anticipated the possibility of nonlinear relation - ships because of the well - documented reverse U - shaped effect of age on mental health service utiliza - tion 4 and evidence from the National Comorbidity Survey of nonlinear increases in help - seeking atti - tudes across our four youngest age categories . 27 We also included gender , race / ethnicity ( four categories : non - Hispanic white , non - Hispanic black , Hispanic , and other ) , and years of education as covariates in the analyses . We dummy coded gender and race / ethnicity , and entered years of education as a contin - uous variable to maximize its variance . We included past - year mood or anxiety disorder as a covariate in the analyses . In the NCS - R , diag - noses were based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition criteria for mental disorders using a modiﬁed version of the World Health Organization’s Composite International Di - agnostic Interview . 29 The mood disorders included in our analysis were major depression , bipolar dis - order , and dysthymia , and the anxiety disorders were agoraphobia , panic disorder , post - traumatic stress disorder , social phobia , speciﬁc phobia , and generalized anxiety disorder . We collapsed mood and anxiety disorders into a single dichotomous variable representing the presence versus absence of any of these disorders in the past year . We did not include alcohol and substance use disorders because of their low prevalence among older adults . Older Adults’ Attitudes and Beliefs Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 16 : 12 , December 2008 1012 Finally , we included lifetime professional mental health service use as a covariate in the analyses . Lifetime use was based on responses to the question of whether or not respondents had ever seen a pro - fessional for problems with their emotions , nerves , or alcohol or drug use . Analytic Strategy We used multiple logistic regression to examine age as a predictor of help - seeking attitudes and treat - ment beliefs , controlling for the other predisposing and need variables included in our models ( i . e . , gen - der , race / ethnicity , years of education , past - year mood or anxiety disorder , and lifetime mental health service use ) . We performed separate analyses for each attitude item , the composite attitude variable , and the belief variable . We ran additional models to examine interactions between age and the other in - dependent variables . To ensure that the data repre - sented the national population , we used the appro - priate statistical weights based on the stratiﬁcation information in the NCS - R public use dataset . We used the Taylor series linearization method 30 in SUDAAN 31 for variance estimation purposes . RESULTS Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for each of the variables in our study across the adult lifespan . (cid:3) 2 analyses revealed that age did not interact with gen - der , but that adults 65 years of age and older were less well educated and more likely to be white than middle - aged and younger participants . In the overall sample , 21 . 9 % of respondents had a mood or anxiety disorder in the past 12 months , whereas only 4 . 6 % TABLE 1 .

Signiﬁcant (cid:3) 2 analyses for these variables reﬂect decreasing prevalence of both disor - ders and help seeking among older adults , with the lowest rates among those 75 and older . With respect to the overall attitude composite vari - able , the majority of respondents ( 83 . 7 % ) reported positive attitudes toward mental health services . Data from Table 1 conﬁrms our hypothesis that older adults’ help - seeking attitudes are as or more positive than younger adults’ attitudes . In our multivariate logistic regression model , the only signiﬁcant predic - tors of overall attitudes toward seeking mental health services were past - year mood or anxiety dis - order and age , Wald F ( 6 , 42 ) (cid:3) 3 . 51 , p (cid:4) 0 . 01 . Logistic regression output in Table 2 demonstrates that par - ticipants in the 55 – 64 and 65 – 74 - year - old age cate - gories were signiﬁcantly more likely than the young ( 18 – 24 ) reference group to have positive attitudes . In addition , those in the 75 and older age category did not differ signiﬁcantly from the young reference group . To examine what seemed to be a reverse J - shaped distribution , whereby help - seeking atti - tudes become increasingly positive across the ﬁrst 5 age groups with a modest downturn for the two oldest groups , we conducted a follow - up analysis predicting our composite attitude score from the square root of age . The curvilinear effect of age on attitudes was nearly signiﬁcant , Wald F ( 1 , 42 ) (cid:3) 3 . 88 , p (cid:3) 0 . 06 ; AOR (cid:3) 1 . 13 ( CI : 1 . 00 – 1 . 27 ) . In analyses examining interactions between age and the other covariates in the model , none of the interaction terms was signiﬁcantly predictive of attitudes . Wald F val - ues ( df (cid:3) 1 , 42 ) for these ﬁve interaction terms ranged from 0 . 06 to 3 . 41 with p values ranging from 0 . 07 to 0 . 81 . Separate regression analyses examining the effect of age and the other covariates on the three individ - ual attitude variables revealed similar ﬁndings . Spe - ciﬁcally , age was a signiﬁcant predictor of willing - ness to seek professional help for serious emotional problems , Wald F ( 6 , 42 ) (cid:3) 2 . 39 , p (cid:3) 0 . 04 . In compar - ison with the young reference group , the likelihood of having positive attitudes was signiﬁcantly greater TABLE 2 .

Older Adults’ Attitudes and Beliefs Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 16 : 12 , December 2008 1014 for those 55 – 64 - years old ( AOR : 1 . 82 , 95 % CI : 1 . 03 – 3 . 22 ) and 65 – 74 - years old ( AOR : 1 . 92 , 95 % CI : 1 . 02 – 3 . 62 ) . Additionally , those in the 75 and older age category exhibited a nonsigniﬁcant trend toward positive willingness scores ( AOR : 1 . 66 , 95 % CI : 0 . 81 – 3 . 40 ) . Regarding how comfortable respon - dents would feel talking about personal problems with a professional , age was not signiﬁcantly related to attitudes , Wald F ( 6 , 42 ) (cid:3) 1 . 64 , p (cid:3) 0 . 16 , and none of the older adult groups were signiﬁcantly different from the 18 – 24 - year - old reference group ; adjusted odds ratios were 1 . 62 ( CI : 0 . 80 – 3 . 26 ) for 55 – 64 - year olds , 1 . 63 ( CI : 0 . 79 – 3 . 37 ) for 65 – 74 - year olds , and 0 . 89 ( CI : 0 . 47 – 1 . 69 ) for adults 75 (cid:2) . Finally , regarding how embarrassed respondents would be if their friends knew they were getting professional help for an emotional problem , age was a signiﬁcant predictor of attitudes , Wald F ( 6 , 42 ) (cid:3) 5 . 89 , p (cid:4) 0 . 001 . However , none of the older adult age categories was signiﬁ - cantly different from the 18 – 24 - year olds ; adjusted odds ratios were 1 . 58 ( CI : 0 . 97 – 2 . 57 ) for 55 – 64 - year olds , 1 . 07 ( CI : 0 . 66 – 1 . 74 ) for 65 – 74 - year olds , and 1 . 41 ( 0 . 80 – 2 . 50 ) for adults 75 years of age and older . The majority of respondents ( 72 % ) also reported positive beliefs about the effectiveness of profes - sional mental health services . The nonsigniﬁcant (cid:3) 2 test of the association between age and belief in Table 1 supported our hypothesis that treatment beliefs do not vary across the lifespan . As well , the main effect of age on beliefs in our multivariate model was not signiﬁcant , Wald F ( 6 , 42 ) (cid:3) 1 . 48 , p (cid:3) 0 . 21 . Despite these negative ﬁndings , we included individual age group predictors in our multivariate model to exam - ine the possibility of a nonlinear association between age and beliefs . The results of this logistic regression model in Table 3 revealed that positive beliefs were associated with younger age , female gender , white race / ethnicity , having received mental health ser - vices in one’s lifetime , and an absence of mood or anxiety disorders in the past year . With respect to age , respondents 25 – 34 and 65 – 74 were signiﬁcantly more likely to have negative beliefs compared with the young reference group . However , given the sim - ilarities in odds ratios among participants older than 24 , our results seemed to suggest especially positive beliefs among 18 – 24 - year olds rather than a decrease TABLE 3 .

To test this hypothesis , we re - ran this analysis using adults 65 – 74 years of age as the reference category . As expected , only those in the youngest age category were signiﬁcantly more likely to have positive beliefs , providing sup - port for our hypothesis that treatment beliefs remain relatively stable over the adult lifespan . As was the case with attitudes , additional analyses examining interactions between age and the other covariates when predicting treatment beliefs were not signiﬁ - cant . Wald F values ( df (cid:3) 1 , 42 ) for these ﬁve inter - action terms ranged from 0 . 11 to 3 . 32 with p values ranging from 0 . 08 to 0 . 74 . DISCUSSION The key ﬁnding from this study is that , contrary to frequent speculation in the gerontology literature , older Americans do not have negative help - seeking attitudes or negative beliefs about the efﬁcacy of treatment for mental health problems . This ﬁnding is true in an abso - lute sense ; more than 80 % of adults 55 and older had positive attitudes , and more than 70 % had positive treat - ment beliefs . Our results also show that older adults’ attitudes are positive relative to younger adults’ . Data from the NCS - R revealed increasingly posi - tive help - seeking attitudes across the lifespan until 55 – 64 years of age , and then a slight decrease among the young - old ( 65 – 74 ) and old - old ( 75 (cid:2) ) age groups . Importantly , adults 55 – 74 years of age exhibited sig - niﬁcantly more positive attitudes than those 18 – 24 years of age , and the help - seeking attitudes of our old - old ( 75 (cid:2) ) age group did not differ from the youngest age group . The ﬁrst of the baby boom generation , represented by adults 55 – 64 years old in this survey , exhibited the most positive help - seeking attitudes . After controlling for other variables , they were nearly three times more likely than the young reference group to endorse positive attitudes toward seeking professional help for emotional concerns . It may not be a coincidence that this same age group showed the largest increase in outpatient psycho - therapy use from 1987 to 1997 in the National Med - ical Expenditure Survey . 32 Longitudinal data are needed to determine whether this peak in positive attitudes among adults in their late 1950s and early 1960s reﬂects a developmental change for adults of this age or a cohort effect . Regardless of which of these explanations is true , as this group ages we are likely to see increasing numbers of them seeking mental health services so long as their help - seeking attitudes remain positive . Age was the only demographic variable in our model that predicted attitudes , having a stronger inﬂuence than other demographic factors that have consistently been linked to positive attitudes , includ - ing black race / ethnicity 26 , 33 and female gender . 20 , 34 The only other variable in our model that was related to attitudes was past - year mood or anxiety disorder . Our ﬁnding that the presence of a mood or anxiety disorder in the past year was associated with nega - tive attitudes toward seeking professional help rep - licates similar ﬁndings among U . S . military person - nel 35 and older Korean Americans . 36 This unsettling ﬁnding of negative help - seeking attitudes among those individuals with the greatest mental health needs might be due to the negative cognitive bias seen in mood and anxiety disorder patients . 37 Impor - tantly , negative attitudes among those with mood or anxiety disorders does not seem to be due to inade - quate mental healthcare or dissatisfaction with treatment , as prior help seeking did not emerge as a signiﬁcant predictor in this model . Additional research is needed to better understand this poten - tially signiﬁcant barrier to service use that the data suggest is equally likely to affect younger and older individuals . With respect to treatment beliefs , there was very little variation across the lifespan with the exception of especially positive beliefs about treatment efﬁcacy among the youngest age group . This peak in positive treatment beliefs among 18 – 24 - year olds is especially puzzling considering that they evidenced the least positive help - seeking attitudes out of any other age group in this study . Given increases in both the prevalence of disorders and help seeking across our two youngest age groups , it may be that additional experience with mental health problems and associ - ated treatments among 25 – 34 - year olds lead them to become increasingly open to the need to seek help and somewhat more sceptical about the beneﬁts of doing so . With the exception of the youngest age group , however , the absence of strong age effects on treatment beliefs is consistent with other studies that have failed to ﬁnd differences between younger and older adults’ beliefs about the effectiveness of mental health services . 10 , 24 Older Adults’ Attitudes and Beliefs Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 16 : 12 , December 2008 1016 In contrast to the relatively modest effect of age on treatment beliefs , we found signiﬁcantly more posi - tive ratings of the effectiveness of seeing a mental health professional among women , white partici - pants , individuals who did not meet criteria for a mental disorder in the past year , and those who had previously sought help . As was the case with atti - tudes , having a mood or anxiety disorder in the past year was associated with negative treatment beliefs . Such beliefs do not seem to be due to dissatisfaction with treatment given that prior help seeking in this study , and in a study by Jorm et al . , 24 was associated with positive treatment beliefs . These encouraging results suggest that the increasing prevalence of mental health service use over time , 3 especially among baby boomers , 32 may be responsible for im - provements in beliefs about the effectiveness of men - tal health services . 38 Longitudinal research is needed to test this hypothesis and to examine whether older adults are especially likely to exhibit such improve - ments . With respect to our ﬁnding of less positive treatment beliefs among racial and ethnic minorities , similar results were reported by Bystritsky et al . 23 However , beliefs about pharmacotherapy and psy - chotherapy should be examined separately given a recent Internet study of 78 , 753 adults , which found that white participants held especially positive treat - ment beliefs concerning medication , whereas racial and ethnic minorities held more positive beliefs about counseling . 33 Importantly , previous help seek - ing , race / ethnicity , and the other covariates in our model did not interact with age , suggesting that their inﬂuences on treatment beliefs are relatively stable across the lifespan , or at least across various age cohorts . This study’s ﬁndings that help - seeking attitudes and treatment beliefs are unlikely contributors to older adults’ disproportionate underutilization of mental health services should be interpreted in light of the following limitations . First , although survey instruments exist that reliably measure distinct as - pects of help - seeking attitudes and treatment beliefs with multiple questions , 23 , 39 the National Comorbid - ity Surveys examine them as unitary constructs with very few questions , likely because attitudes and be - liefs were not primary outcomes . Doing so intro - duces unreliability into the measurement of these constructs , as evidenced by the low internal consis - tency of the attitude composite score , and limits our ability to explore them , and their relationships with age , in complex ways . Furthermore , according to the theory of planned behavior , 14 attitudes toward seek - ing mental health services affect such service use in concert with perceived control over potential barriers to seeking help and perceived social pressure to seek or not seek help . Attitudes , perceived control , and subjective norms are inﬂuenced , in turn , by behav - ioral , normative , and control beliefs , as well as a host of background factors . Clearly , this theoretical model suggests that the assessment of attitudes and beliefs in the NCS - R is limited , and that additional research is needed to explore age differences in more nuanced aspects of the relationship between help seeking , attitudes , and beliefs . A second limitation is that treatment beliefs in this survey were measured by asking participants what percentage of people who see professionals for serious emotional problems are helped . Although this question provides very useful general information , longitudinal research is needed to examine changes in treatment beliefs as a result of advances in therapy , such as the introduction of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors into the U . S . market in 1988 , 40 or as a result of personal experience with mental health service providers . Third , the cross - sectional nature of the NCS - R does not allow us to determine whether age differences in help - seeking attitudes are due to lifespan devel - opment , birth cohort effects , or a combination of these factors . Finally , because the NCS - R excluded institutionalized individuals , including those liv - ing in nursing homes , our results are only gener - alizable to community - dwelling younger and older adults . Together , evidence of increasing prevalence of mental disorders over time , 41 increasing health care costs associated with mental illness , and increases in the proportion of older individuals in the popula - tion , 42 highlights the importance of better under - standing older adults’ mental health needs and en - hancing their use of mental health services . Attitudes toward seeking help are key determinants of whether or not individuals use mental health ser - vices , having a stronger inﬂuence than even psy - chiatric disorders among individuals who perceive a need for help . 16 Given their strong inﬂuence on service utilization , our results suggest that predis - posing attitude and belief factors , according to Andersen’s 8 model , are not barriers to mental Mackenzie et al . Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 16 : 12 , December 2008 1017 health service use for a majority of older adults ( at least 70 % of whom had positive help - seeking atti - tudes and treatment beliefs in the NCS - R ) . Our ﬁndings suggest that research aimed at under - standing and ameliorating older adults’ underuti - lization of mental health services should focus on enabling resources , such as access to properly trained geriatric mental health professionals , as well as objec - tive and perceived indicators of need for help . While it is essential that we continue working toward meeting older adults’ mental health needs , their positive atti - tudes and beliefs in this study remind us of the impor - tance of viewing old age as a time of strength , open - ness , and resilience , as opposed to a time of weakness , conservatism , and frailty . 43 – 45 Dr .
