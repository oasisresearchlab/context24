Diverse WASP family members are recruited to distinct cellular membranes by membrane - associated signaling complexes that function as localization and activation factors . A contributing factor to dynamic actin assembly is the molecule cortactin , which lo - calizes to all sites of branched actin assembly and both pro - motes WASP - induced actin polymerization and stabilizes actin branches after their formation ( Uruno et al . , 2001 ; Weaver et al . , 2001 , 2002 ; Goley and Welch , 2006 ) . Most branched actin assemblies have lifetimes in the seconds - to - minutes timescale and are much more dynamic than other forms of cellular actin ( Lai et al . , 2008 ; Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ) . The dynamic nature of branched actin is likely critical for its functions in controlling dynamic protrusions and other membrane - based events . Increasing evidence indicates that actin plays an im - portant role in postinternalization events along the endocytic pathway , including endosomal tubulation , vesicle fusion , and fission , and endosome motility ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Duleh and Welch , 2010 ; Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ; Ohashi et al . , 2011 ; Tanabe et al . , 2011 ; Monteiro et al . , 2013 ) . Consistent with its integral role in Arp2 / 3 complex – mediated branched actin as - sembly , cortactin has been shown to regulate many of these processes . Our previous studies showed that cortactin controls late endosomal / lysosomal maturation and subsequent retro - grade transport to the Golgi apparatus ( Kirkbride et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , cortactin regulation of dynamic actin assembly on endosomes in coordination with Arp2 / 3 complex and Wis - kott - Aldrich syndrome protein and Scar homologue ( WASH ) was shown to control cargo sorting ( Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ; Ohashi et al . , 2011 ; Monteiro et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , cort - actin promotes actin - mediated fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes ( Lee et al . , 2010 ) . Collectively , these data indicate that cortactin is a key regulator of actin - dependent endosomal processes . However , how cortactin itself is controlled on en - dosomes is poorly understood . Phosphoinositides ( PIs ) are membrane phospholipids that are generated in small amounts at specific cellular membranes by distinct PI kinases . PIs decorate a given organelle with mo - lecular identity and recruit specific effector proteins to confer a distinct set of functions ( Behnia and Munro , 2005 ; Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ; Kutateladze , 2010 ) , including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton ( Janmey and Lindberg , 2004 ; Saari - kangas et al . , 2010 ) . Among different PIs , PI4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) is the best - characterized regulator of actin organi - zation . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding to N - WASP is a key step in N - WASP activation by inducing a conformational change that releases the Arp2 / 3 - binding VCA domain ( Rohatgi et al . , 2000 ; Pa - Branched actin critically contributes to membrane trafficking by regulating membrane curvature , dynamics , fission , and transport . However , how actin dynamics are controlled at membranes is poorly understood . Here , we identify the branched actin regulator cortactin as a direct binding partner of phosphatidylinositol 3 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ) and demonstrate that their interaction promotes turnover of late endosomal actin . In vitro biochemical studies indicated that cortactin binds PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 via its actin filament - binding region . Furthermore , PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 competed with actin filaments for binding to cortactin , thereby antagonizing cortactin activity . These findings suggest that PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 formation on endo - somes may remove cortactin from endosome - associated branched actin . Indeed , inhibition of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 production led to cortactin accumulation and actin stabilization on Rab7 + endosomes . Conversely , inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex activity greatly reduced cortactin localization to late endosomes . Knockdown of cortactin reversed PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - inhibitor – induced actin accumulation and stabilization on endosomes . These data suggest a model in which PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 binding removes cortactin from late endosomal branched actin networks and thereby promotes net actin turnover .

PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 also controls actin fil - ament severing , capping , cross - linking , and actin – membrane binding interactions , through interactions with actin - binding proteins such as cofilin , gelsolin , capZ , filamin , α - actinin , vinculin , and talin ( Yin and Janmey , 2003 ; Janmey and Lind - berg , 2004 ) . In addition , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 regulates activation of the WASP family member WAVE2 to control lamellipodial protru - sion ( Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ) . However , because PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 primarily mark the plasma membrane , the role of PIs in controlling actin dynamics at other membrane compart - ments is less well understood . PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 is a low - abundance PI that mainly localizes to late endosomes and lysosomes in higher eukaryotes ( Ikono - mov et al . , 2006 ; Michell et al . , 2006 ) and in the yeast vacuole ( Rudge et al . , 2004 ) . PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 directs trafficking of cargo vesi - cles along the endosome – lysosome axis , and governs a plethora of associated cellular functions , including endolysosome mor - phology , acidification , autophagy , stress - induced signaling , and ion channel activity ( Yin and Janmey , 2003 ; Shisheva , 2008 ; de Lartigue et al . , 2009 ; Dove et al . , 2009 ) . Defects in the regula - tion of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 are linked to several human diseases , including Charcot - Marie - Tooth type 4 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , which are thought to be caused by defective autophagy ( Bolino et al . , 2000 ; Chow et al . , 2007 ; Ferguson et al . , 2009 ; Kotoulas et al . , 2011 ; Otomo et al . , 2012 ) . Despite the well - characterized roles of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 in endolysosomal trafficking and disease , few molecular effector proteins of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 have been identified . In this study , we characterize a novel and direct binding interaction of cortactin with PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 . We show that purified cortactin interacts with PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 through its filamentous actin ( F - actin ) binding domain . Furthermore , PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 competes with F - actin for binding to cortactin , leading to inhibition of cortactin - mediated branched actin nucleation and stabilization . Inhibition of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis in cells resulted in actin stabi - lization on late endosomes which is abolished by cortactin de - pletion . Based on these findings , we propose a model in which PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 removes cortactin from nascent membrane - associated actin , limiting overall assembly of branched actin at late en - dosomes . Cycles of conversion between PI ( 3 ) P and PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 may allow fast actin dynamics on endosomal membranes and consequent membrane - trafficking events . Results Cortactin directly binds to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 Cortactin regulates branched actin assembly at membranes throughout the cell . Because cortactin has a putative PI - bind - ing site in its N terminus ( He et al . , 1998 ) , we hypothesized that PIs might regulate its recruitment or activity at specific membrane sites . To test this hypothesis and identify candidate PI binding partners , we performed a lipid overlay assay with GST - tagged full - length cortactin . GST - fusion proteins ( Fig . S1 A , Coomassie staining ) were incubated with phospholipids im - mobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane ( PIP strip ) . Full - length cortactin interacted most strongly with PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 1 A ) , and to a much lesser extent with other phosphoinositides , in - cluding PI ( 3 ) P and PI ( 5 ) P . Hrs - FYVE and PLC - PH lipid - bind - ing domains were used as respective positive controls for PI ( 3 ) P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding . PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 is found with highest abundance on late endo - somes ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ; Michell et al . , 2006 ) , where cortactin also has been shown to localize ( Sung et al . , 2011 ; Kirkbride et al . , 2012 ; Rossé et al . , 2014 ) . To further validate the interaction and determine whether cortactin inter - acts directly with PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 in more physiologically relevant conditions , we performed a liposome pull - down assay . Com - mercial PolyPIPosome liposomes containing 5 % PI ( PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 ) P , or PI ( 5 ) P ) and 1 % biotin - phosphatidylethanolamine in a mixture of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanol - amine were incubated with GST – cortactin , and then isolated with streptavidin - coated magnetic beads . GST alone and the PI ( 3 ) P - binding protein GST - 2xFYVE were used as respective negative and positive controls . Western blot analysis of the pull - downs revealed that full - length cortactin specifically binds lipo - somes containing PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , but not PI ( 3 ) P or PI ( 5 ) P ( Fig . 1 , B and C , probed with anti - GST antibody ; Fig . S1 C , probed with anti - cortactin antibody ) . Analysis of binding isotherms with varying lipid input revealed an apparent equilibrium dissocia - tion constant ( K d ) of 30 nM for cortactin – PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 interactions ( Fig . 1 D ) . Collectively , these results indicate that cortactin di - rectly and specifically binds to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 . Inhibition of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis leads to accumulation of cortactin on late endosomes The enzyme complex that synthesizes PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 localizes to both early and late endosomes and consists of the scaffold protein Vac14 , the lipid kinase PIKfyve ( which converts PI ( 3 ) P to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ) , and the counteracting lipid phosphatase Fig4 ( Rudge et al . , 2004 ; Ikonomov et al . , 2006 ; Nicot et al . , 2006 ; Rusten et al . , 2006 ; Rutherford et al . , 2006 ) . To determine whether cortactin and the PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - synthesizing enzyme complex are likely to be present in the same compartment , we immunolocalized cortactin with Vac14 . Immunostaining of SCC61 and HeLa cells transiently expressing hVac14 - EGFP ( Jin et al . , 2008 ) with antibodies against cortactin revealed that cortactin is indeed present on Vac14 + vesicular structures ( Fig . 2 A ) . To further determine whether cortactin is present at PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - containing endosomes , we localized cortactin with a specific probe for PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , mCherry - ML1N * 2 ( Li et al . , 2013 ) , and with the late endosomal marker Rab7 . As ex - pected , mCherry - ML1N * 2 and Rab7 were present together in the same endosomal populations with virtually all ML1N * 7 + endosomes containing Rab7 + puncta or rings ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) . Consistent with the role of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 in late endosomal mat - uration ( de Lartigue et al . , 2009 ; Dove et al . , 2009 ) , individ - ual endosomes had different proportions of Rab7 or ML1N * 2 positivity ( Fig . 2 C ) . Cortactin localized to some of these Rab7 - ML1N * 2 + endosomes ( Fig . 2 B ) . A central function of PIs on membranes is recruitment of cytosolic proteins , including cytoskeletal proteins ( Janmey and Lindberg , 2004 ) . To investigate whether PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 recruits cortactin to endosomes , we prevented cellular PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 syn - thesis by knocking down PIKfyve expression with siRNA in MDA - MB - 231 cancer cells ( Fig . 2 D ) . Consistent with previ - ous studies , inhibition of PIKfyve led to enlargement of late endosomes marked by Rab7 ( Fig . 2 E ; Nicot et al . , 2006 ) . Surprisingly , silencing of PIKfyve led to a marked increase in cortactin localization to Rab7 + late endosomes rather than the expected decrease ( Fig . 2 , E and F ) . Likewise , treatment of MDA - MB - 231 or SCC61 cells with the specific PIKfyve inhibitor drugs YM201636 ( Ikonomov et al . , 2006 ; Jefferies et al . , 2008 ; de Lartigue et al . , 2009 ) or apilimod ( Cai et al . , PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 regulates cortactin – actin interactions • Hong et al . 755 2013 ) phenocopied the effect of PIKfyve siRNA ( Fig . 3 , A and C ; Fig . S2 , A – D ; and Video 1 ) . Despite inducing en - largement of individual endosomes , YM201636 drug treat - ment had no significant effect on the total Rab7 + endosome area per cell ( Fig . 3 E ) , suggesting that the increased overlap between cortactin and Rab7 + area per cell ( Fig . 3 C ) is not a secondary effect of endosomal enlargement . Immunofluo - rescence of YM201636 - treated cells using early ( EEA1 ) and late endosomal ( Rab7 ) markers confirmed that the majority of the enlarged vesicular compartments were Rab7 + with only a few endosomes positive for both EEA1 and Rab7 , reflect - ing perturbation in late endosomal maturation and / or traffick - ing ( Fig . S2 E ; Rutherford et al . , 2006 ) . These data indicate that PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 does not function to recruit cortactin to late endosomes but may instead regulate its activity by removing it from the late endosome . Inhibition of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis leads to cortactin - dependent actin accumulation on Rab7 + endosomes Cortactin has a unique role as a regulator of Arp2 / 3 complex by promoting both assembly and stability of branched actin net - works ( Uruno et al . , 2001 ; Weaver et al . , 2001 ) . Along with cort - actin , inhibition of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis by MDA - MB - 231 and SCC61 cells with YM201636 , apilimod , or knockdown ( KD ) of PIKfyve caused a striking enrichment of actin on Rab7 + endo - somes ( Fig . 2 E ; Fig . 3 A ; and Fig . S2 C ) . Quantitative analysis of the imaging data demonstrated that actin intensity and the number of actin dots on Rab7 + endosomes were significantly increased in YM201636 - treated cells ( Fig . 3 , F and G ) . Colo - calization of actin with Rab7 was also increased in YM201636 - and apilimod - treated and PIKfyve - KD cells ( Fig . 2 F ; Fig . 3 D ; Fig . S2 B [ compare YM201636 and DMSO treatments in con - trol cells ] ; and Fig . S2 D ) . The YM201636 - induced accumula - tion of actin on late endosomes was reversed in cortactin – KD cells ( Fig . 3 D and Fig . S2 B ) . These data indicate that PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis on late endosomes attenuates actin accumulation . Fur - thermore , in the absence of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , actin accumulates in a cortactin - dependent manner . Cortactin localization to late endosomes depends on Arp2 / 3 complex activity One mechanism by which cortactin could promote accumu - lation of actin on endosomes is by regulating branched actin Figure 1 . Cortactin directly interacts with PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 . ( A ) The affinity of full - length cortactin was examined using a protein - lipid overlay assay . The left panel in - dicates the identity of lipid species on the PIP strip . Cortactin binds most strongly to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 . Binding of the FYVE domain of Hrs ( 2xFYVE ) and PH domain of PLC - δ 1 to PI ( 3 ) P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , respectively , served as positive controls .

To determine whether Arp2 / 3 - medi - ated branched actin nucleation is required for recruiting cortactin to endosomal membranes , we treated cells with the Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitor CK - 666 ( Nolen et al . , 2009 ; Hetrick et al . , 2013 ) . Treatment with CK - 666 resulted in significantly reduced cortactin localization on Rab7 + en - dosomes ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . Moreover , the accumulation of cortactin that occurs with inhibition of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis by YM201636 was abolished in CK - 666 – treated cells . Like - Figure 2 .

PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 regulates cortactin – actin interactions • Hong et al . 757 wise , Arp2 / 3 inhibition with CK - 666 treatment inhibited actin accumulation on Rab7 + late endosomes in both control and YM201636 - treated cells ( Fig . 4 , A and C ) . These data sug - gest a model in which cortactin is recruited to late endosomes by interactions with branched actin networks and removed by interaction with PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 . The fourth repeat region of cortactin is necessary for PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 binding Cortactin does not contain canonical phosphoinositide - binding motifs , such as PH ( pleckstin homology ) or FYVE domains . However , it has been predicted that a series of basic lysine res - idues within the N - terminal fourth repeat domain of cortactin may bind phosphoinositides ( He et al . , 1998 ) . The fourth repeat region of cortactin is also thought to be a critical F - actin – bind - ing site ( Weed et al . , 2000 ) and binding to F - actin is required for cortactin to regulate Arp2 / 3 - mediated branched actin assembly and stability ( Uruno et al . , 2001 ; Weaver et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , binding of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 to this region could modulate the interac - tion of cortactin with actin filaments . To map the PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 binding site of cortactin , we tested the ability of the purified cortactin N terminus and fourth re - peat deletion mutant to bind PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - containing liposomes ( Fig . 5 A ) . The cortactin repeat domains each contain 37 aa ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) and are not likely to be involved in large scale folding of cortactin because common splice variants of cortactin have lost either the sixth or fifth + sixth repeats ( van Rossum et al . , 2003 ) and purified cortactin has been shown to have an extended structure ( Weaver et al . , 2002 ) . Furthermore , deletion of the fourth repeat domain from either end of N - or C - terminal cortactin fragments leads to loss of binding of those fragments to actin filaments ( Weed et al . , 2000 ) , suggesting a specific activity Figure 3 .

PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 regulates cortactin – actin interactions • Hong et al . 759 of that domain and not whole - scale unfolding of the molecule . Finally , we find that cortactin lacking the fourth repeat can still bind to Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 5 B ) , further suggesting that loss of the fourth repeat domain does not affect cortactin activities located in other parts of the N terminus . Consistent with our hypothesis that the PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 binding activity might be located in the fourth repeat domain in the N terminus , we found that the N terminus of cortactin is sufficient to bind PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 5 C ) , whereas the fourth repeat deletion mutant of cortactin cannot bind PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - liposomes ( Fig . 5 D ) . To further delineate the role of the fourth repeat in binding F - actin and PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , we made a series of charge - neutralizing mutations that changed lysines present in the fourth repeat to glutamine ( Fig . S3 , A and B : 1Q , 2Q , 3Q , 5Q , and 8Q mu - tants ) . Analysis of the purified proteins in an actin co - sedi - mentation assay revealed that the ability of cortactin to bind to actin filaments was progressively lost with increasing num - bers of mutated lysines ( Fig . S3 C ) . There was also a trend toward decreased binding of the mutants to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 . How - ever , only the 8Q mutant exhibited significantly lower specific binding to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , potentially because of variability asso - ciated with increased nonspecific binding of the mutant pro - teins to the beads used for the pull - down assays ( Fig . S3 D , beads only lanes in blots ) . PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 competes with actin filaments for binding to cortactin Altogether , our binding data with the N terminus , fourth re - peat mutant , and 1Q - 8Q mutants suggest that actin filaments and PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 both bind to sites in the fourth cortactin repeat which could be overlapping . To specifically test the hypothe - sis that PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 competes with actin filaments for binding to cortactin , we performed in vitro binding assays using purified proteins . As shown in Fig . 5 ( E and F ) the addition of increasing concentrations of actin filaments to samples containing cortac - tin and PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - liposomes led to a dose - dependent decrease in the amount of cortactin bound to the liposomes . The Ki of 0 . 461 µM is consistent with the lower published affinity of cort - actin for F - actin ( K d = 0 . 250 µM , ( Bryce et al . , 2005 ) ) than for PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ( K d = 30 nM , Fig . 1 ) . PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 affects in vitro activity of cortactin The finding that PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 prevents cortactin from binding to actin filaments suggests that PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 may inhibit the activity of cortactin in controlling branched actin dynamics . To directly test the role of cortactin in branched actin nucleation , we used total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to mon - itor formation of branched actin filaments from purified proteins Figure 5 .

Consistent with previous studies ( Weaver et al . , 2001 , 2002 ; Uruno et al . , 2003 ; Siton et al . , 2011 ; Helgeson and Nolen , 2013 ; Helgeson et al . , 2014 ) , addition of cortactin to reactions containing Arp2 / 3 complex , the active VCA domain of N - WASp ( GST - VCA ) , and G - actin increased the rate of actin branch formation ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . Addition of 200 nM PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - liposomes significantly reduced cortactin - induced enhancement of branched actin assembly , al - though it did not totally ablate it . At higher concentrations of liposomes there was a greater inhibition of cortactin - mediated enhanced branched actin assembly ; however there was also an effect on control reactions ( unpublished data ) . In contrast , at concentrations ≤ 200 nM , PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - liposomes had no effect on branching induced by GST - VCA + Arp2 / 3 complex in the absence of cortactin , indicating a selective effect on cortactin . Addition of 200 nM PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - liposomes had no effect on cort - actin - regulated branching ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) , consistent with the minimal binding of cortactin to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 detected in the PIP strip assay ( Fig . 1 A ) and suggesting a specific effect of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 . Because cortactin is also known to stabilize actin branches ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ) , we tested whether PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 prevents branch stabilization by cortactin . Actin filaments were prepo - lymerized in the presence of Arp2 / 3 complex and GST - VCA and then cortactin , PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - liposomes , both cortactin and PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - liposomes , both cortactin and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - liposomes , or buffer were added to individual reactions . For the debranching assay , 500 nM PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - liposomes had no effect on control reactions so the higher concentration was used . At various time points , rhodamine - phalloidin was added to visualize and stabilize the filaments and images were obtained . The number of branched actin filaments at each time point was quantitated . Consistent with previous observations ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ) , the presence of cortactin inhibited debranching ( Fig . 6 , C and D ) . In contrast , the addition of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - liposomes but not PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - liposomes reversed branch stabilization by cortactin but had no effect on control networks ( Fig . 6 , C and D ) . Together , these data indicate that PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 can remodel branched actin networks by regulat - ing the interaction of cortactin with actin filaments . PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 regulates actin stability on late endosomes The finding that PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 competes with F - actin for binding to cortactin ( Fig . 5 , E and F ) suggests that synthesis of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 may regulate cortactin cycling on and off of branched actin networks on late endosomal membranes . Consistent with that model , we found that inhibition of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis leads to accumulation of cortactin on Rab7 + endosomes ( Fig . 2 , D – F ; Fig . 3 ; and Fig . S2 , A – D ) . In addition , PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - mediated re - moval of cortactin from actin branchpoints could lead to de - creased actin assembly and / or destabilization of branched actin networks associated with the endosomal surface . Indeed , in fixed cell analyses , we found that inhibition of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthe - sis led to cortactin - dependent accumulation of actin on Rab7 + endosomes ( Fig . 3 and Fig . S2 , A and B ) . To test whether en - dosomal actin turnover is regulated by cortactin and PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , live imaging was performed on control or cortactin – KD cells expressing the dynamic actin probe mGFP - F - tractin in the pres - ence or absence of the PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis inhibitor YM201636 . To specifically analyze actin turnover , cells were treated with 10 µM latrunculin A , a drug that prevents actin polymeriza - tion by sequestering monomeric actin ( Morton et al . , 2000 ) . In control cells treated with DMSO as the diluent control for YM201636 , endosomal actin fluorescence became undetect - able within 40 – 50 s after Latrunculin A . A quantitative analy - sis across multiple control cells revealed an exponential loss in the intensity of endosomal actin fluorescence after latrunculin exposure , with a t 1 / 2 of 20 . 8 s . In contrast , endosomal actin flu - orescence in YM201636 - treated cells decreased more slowly , yielding a t 1 / 2 of 109 . 3 s . ( Fig . 7 and Video 7 ) , indicating that PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 is important for dynamic turnover of late endosomal actin assemblies . DMSO - treated cortactin – KD cells showed similar exponential loss of actin fluorescence ( t 1 / 2 = 15 . 6 s ) compared with DMSO - treated control cells . Importantly , the delayed actin turnover observed in YM201636 - treated control cells was not observed in cortactin – KD cells with curve fits yielding t 1 / 2 of 15 . 5 s . These data indicate that PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 con - trols endosomal actin turnover in a cortactin - dependent manner . PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 regulates actin assembly in cells with varying cortactin expression levels As cortactin is frequently overexpressed in cancer cells , it is possible that excess cortactin might counteract the ability of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 to remove it from endosomal actin . Our image anal - ysis of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 localization indicates that PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 is local - ized specifically to a subset of endosomal membranes ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) . Thresholding of those images allows us to estimate that ∼ 2 . 7 % of the total cell area is occupied by PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , whereas cortactin is present throughout the entire cytoplasm , and thus has access to ∼ 66 % of the total cell area . Using radioactive la - beling with 3 [ H ] - inositol and HPLC analysis of phosphoinosit - ide levels in MDA - MB - 231 cells , we calculated a ratio of the PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 + PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 peak to the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 peak of 0 . 85 % ( Fig . S4 , A – D ) . This represents a maximum ratio of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 as it cannot be separated from PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 by HPLC , and is close to the ratio of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 of 0 . 8 % calculated in fibroblasts ( Zolov et al . , 2012 ) . Using a previous estimate of the absolute concentration of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in cells to be 10 µM ( McLaughlin et al . , 2002 ) , we estimate that the whole - cell level of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 is up to 85 nM and that the concentration on endosomes could be 3 . 1 µM , based on our thresholding . We further estimated from Western blot analysis of cortactin levels in MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Fig . S4 , E and F , 11 . 2 femtogram / cell ) , and using an approx - imate value for cell volume to be 4 , 190 µm 3 ( McLaughlin et al . , 2002 ) , that the effective concentration of cortactin in cells is ∼ 67 nM . Thus , at late endosomes , we estimate that the con - centration of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 is 46 - fold that of the concentration of cortactin molecules . This is a very rough estimate , as it does not take into account what fraction of cortactin is available to inter - act with PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 or local actin filament networks or what other effector molecules of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 may be locally available to bind to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 . Nonetheless , it suggests that PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 is present at a high enough concentration at endosomes to effectively com - pete with actin filaments for cortactin binding across a range of cortactin concentrations . Furthermore , cortactin is unlikely to prevent the binding of other PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 effector molecules . To specifically determine whether regulation of endo - somal actin by PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 still occurs in cells overexpressing cortactin , we exogenously expressed cortactin using lentiviral transduction in MDA - MB - 231 cells . In all cell lines , YM201636 treatment led to a large increase in cortactin and actin accu - mulation at late endosomes ( Fig . S5 ) . There was no effect of cortactin overexpression on the cortactin or actin colocalization with Rab7 in the absence of drug treatment . However , in the presence of YM201636 , several of the cortactin - overexpressing PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 regulates cortactin – actin interactions • Hong et al . 761 Figure 6 .

JCB • VOLUME 210 • NUMBER 5 • 2015 762 cell lines had increased accumulation of actin and cortactin at late endosomes compared with control cells , suggesting that cortactin overexpression does affect endosomal actin . Impor - tantly , these data indicate that PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis is able to con - trol cortactin and actin accumulation at late endosomes across a range of cortactin concentrations . WASH localization is regulated by PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 Activation of Arp2 / 3 complex occurs upon binding of an acti - vator in the WASP family of proteins ( Millard et al . , 2004 ) . At endosomes , the WASP family member WASH appears to be the main activator of Arp2 / 3 complex ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ; Duleh and Welch , 2010 ) and should act in concert with cortactin to promote endosomal branched actin assembly . Consistent with those studies , WASH , cortactin , and actin show strong colocalization on endosomal membranes ( Fig . 8 ) . The FAM21 component of WASH has been found to bind multiple phosphoinositides by dot plot , including the major endosomal lipids PI ( 3 ) P and PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ( Jia et al . , 2010 ) . How - ever , the consequence of that interaction is unclear . To assess the effect of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 on WASH localization , MDA - MB - 231 and SCC61 cells were treated with YM201636 and immunos - tained for WASH and cortactin and colocalized with either actin ( Fig . 8 A ) or mRFP - Rab7 ( Fig . 8 B ) . Inhibition of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis led to an increase in the localization of WASH to cortactin + and actin + structures at Rab7 + endosomes ( Fig . 8 ) , suggesting that similarly to cortactin , PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 does not recruit WASH to endosomal membranes but instead may promote its removal . However , the increase in WASH localization to Rab7 + endosomes was small compared with the increase in cortactin localization in YM201636 - treated cells ( 40 % increase in WASH vs . 300 % increase in cortactin colocalization with Rab7 , com - pare median values in Figs . 8 C and 3 C ) . As with endogenous Rab7 ( Fig . 3 E ) , there was no difference in mRFP - Rab7 area with YM201636 treatment ( Fig . 8 D ) . Overall , PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 plays a concerted role to remove branched actin regulators from late endosomes and promote disassembly of endosome - associated actin assemblies via cortactin ( see model in Fig . 9 ) . Discussion Dynamic actin assembly plays an important role in controlling cellular membrane trafficking . Here , we identify a specific molecular mechanism that regulates actin dynamics on endo - somes : PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - mediated removal of cortactin from actin fila - ment arrays . In vitro biochemical studies revealed that cortactin preferentially and specifically binds to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 via its F - ac - tin binding region . Furthermore , PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 inhibits binding of actin filaments to cortactin , as well as the activity of cortactin in branched actin assembly and stabilization . In cells , inhibition of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis leads to accumulation of stable WASH – cortactin – actin assemblies on Rab7 + endosomes . Finally , the accumulation of actin that occurs in the absence of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 depends on the presence of cortactin , indicating a key role for PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 – cortactin interactions in promoting turnover of late endosomal branched actin assemblies . These findings suggest a model in which actin dynamics on late endosomes are regulated by PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - induced cycling of cortactin on and off of actin filaments ( see model in Fig . 9 ) . In cells , branched actin is very dynamic and controls rapid membrane events , including plasma membrane protru - sions and membrane trafficking events . Our data indicate that the PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 – cortactin interaction we described is a major reg - ulator of actin dynamics at the late endosome and provide a unique example of coordination of endosomal actin dynamics . Because we did not detect significant binding of cortactin to other PIs , it is possible that this specific mechanism of PI – cort - Figure 7 . Actin stability on endosomal mem - brane is controlled by PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 . MDA - MB - 231 cells stably expressing mGFP - F - tractin were treated with DMSO or YM201636 for 2 h , and then im - aged live after treatment with 10 µM latrunculin A ( LatA ) . ( A ) Representative images at 0 and 50 s after LatA treatment . Bar , 5 µm . ( B ) The change in endosomal actin fluorescence over time after LatA treatment was normalized to initial endosomal actin fluorescence . n = 10 – 15 cells from 3 inde - pendent experiments for each condition . PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 regulates cortactin – actin interactions • Hong et al . 763 actin interactions may be unique to the late endosome . At the plasma membrane , other mechanisms may control branched actin dynamics , including control of WAVE2 - mediated actin polymerization by PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Oikawa et al . , 2004 ) . In ad - dition , disassembly of lamellipodial branched actin networks may rely on other molecular mechanisms that promote deb - ranching such as antagonism of cortactin by coronin and of antagonism of Arp2 / 3 complex by glial maturation factor ( Cai et al . , 2008 ; Gandhi et al . , 2010 ; Luan and Nolen , 2013 ; Yden - berg et al . , 2013 ) . Endosomal actin turnover is also likely to be controlled by actin severing factors such as cofilin . Although we cannot rule out a role for such factors in PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - mediated regulation of actin stability , inhibition of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis by YM201636 did not lead to any significant changes in cofilin activity as assessed by phosphorylation of the regulatory serine 3 of cofilin by Western blot analysis ( Fig . S2 F ) . Conversely , inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex or KD of cortactin did reverse the endosomal actin that accumulates with YM201636 treatment , indicating specific regulation of branched actin by PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 . Cortactin can promote actin assembly by both enhancing the ability of WASP family members to activate Arp2 / 3 com - plex and by stabilizing actin branches after they are formed ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ) . Both of those activities require binding of cortactin to actin filaments and were inhibited by PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 binding in vitro . Because access to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 is intrinsically lim - ited to the membrane surface where WASH also is localized , a possible consequence of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 binding to cortactin could be to limit coactivation of Arp2 / 3 complex . This mechanism would be consistent with the strong colocalization of WASH and cortactin on the endosome surface ( Fig . 8 ) and is supported by in vitro evidence that cortactin and WASP family members uniquely act together to promote Arp2 / 3 complex activation ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ; Siton et al . , 2011 ; Helgeson and Nolen , 2013 ) . However , our finding that PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 – cortactin interac - tions specifically promote turnover of endosomal actin in the absence of new actin polymerization ( Fig . 7 ) suggests that inhi - bition of debranching is a key cortactin activity that is controlled by PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 . Furthermore , inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex but not PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis ( Fig . 4 ) inhibited accumulation of cortactin at late endosomes . These data suggest a model in which activa - tion of Arp2 / 3 complex leads to recruitment of cortactin to actin nucleation sites at the late endosome surface . Local synthesis of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 would then promote removal of cortactin and net disassembly of endosomal actin ( Fig . 9 ) . Interestingly , the ap - parent K d of 30 nM that we measured for cortactin – PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 interactions in pull - down assays is similar to the K d of 17 nM re - cently measured for cortactin – branchpoint binding in live TIRF movies ( Helgeson and Nolen , 2013 ) .

JCB • VOLUME 210 • NUMBER 5 • 2015 764 In addition to controlling cortactin localization to en - dosomes , inhibition of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis led to a small but significant increase in WASH localization . Based on a previous study showing that WASH can bind the endosomal lipid PI ( 3 ) P ( Jia et al . , 2010 ) , we speculate that conversion of PI ( 3 ) P to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 could lead to loss of WASH from the endosomal sur - face ( see Fig . 9 for model ) . However , to test this hypothesis , a detailed study of WASH – PIP binding using liposomes , as well as cellular experiments , would be required . It is also possible that PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis could indirectly lead to reduced WASH binding , by controlling the recruitment or activity of another WASH - binding partner . Nonetheless , it appears that PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis has a coordinate effect on both WASH and cortactin localization to late endosomes . PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 regulates maturation of and trafficking from late endosomes . Our previous studies with cortactin – KD cells identified several strong phenotypes that are similar to those in cells with defective PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 formation , including enlargement of immature late endosomal / lysosomal compartments and de - fects in retrograde trafficking from late endosomes to the Golgi apparatus ( Sung et al . , 2011 ; Kirkbride et al . , 2012 ) . Moreover , cortactin - mediated actin remodeling is also known to regulate EGFR recycling and degradation in lysosomes ( Timpson et al . , 2005 ; Lladó et al . , 2008 ) and autophagosome – lysosome fusion ( Lee et al . , 2010 ) , both phenotypes controlled by PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ( de Lartigue et al . , 2009 ) . Notably , both overly stable and overly dynamic actin , as occurs , respectively with inhibition of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis and cortactin – KD ( Fig . 7 ) , is associated with similar vacuolation and defective endosomal maturation phenotypes ( de Lartigue et al . , 2009 ; Kirkbride et al . , 2012 ) . These data suggest that actin dynamics must be finely tuned at late endosomes for proper maturation and functioning . Fur - thermore , our data suggest that control of branched actin dy - namics through cortactin is at least one important mechanism by which PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 controls endosomal function . In summary , we described a unique molecular mecha - nism that controls branched actin dynamics at late endosomes via PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - mediated removal of cortactin from actin filament networks . Dynamic cycling of phosphoinositides to orchestrate both assembly and disassembly of filament networks may be Figure 9 . Model of endosomal branched actin network regulation by PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 . ( A ) Branched actin nucleation is initiated by the WASH complex which is bound to the surface of late endosomes by signaling molecules that likely include PI ( 3 ) P ( Jia et al . , 2010 ) . WASH - induced activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex recruits cortactin to nascent branch points ( Fig . 4 ) , where it synergistically promotes actin assembly . ( B ) Conversion of PI ( 3 ) P to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 is accomplished by the enzymatic activity of PIKfyve within the three - member PIKfyve complex that includes the scaffold protein Vac14 and the opposing 5 ′ phosphatase Fig . 4 ( Shisheva , 2008 ; Dove et al . , 2009 ) . ( C ) PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 binds to cortactin , releasing actin filaments ( Fig . 5 ) and potentially the WASH complex from endosomes ( Fig . 8 ) . ( D ) Without cortactin binding to the branchpoint , Arp2 / 3 complex loses affinity for the mother filament ( Uruno et al . , 2001 ) causing debranching ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ; Fig . 6 ) . Disassembly of branched actin networks leads to diminished recruitment of cortactin . ( E ) Conversion of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 back to PI ( 3 ) P should release cortactin from the endosome surface unless new branched actin networks are available for rebinding . Interconversion of PI ( 3 ) P and PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 by the PIKfyve complex may facilitate dynamic cycling of actin assembly and disassembly through control of cortactin – actin interactions .

After growth to approxi - mately OD 600 = 0 . 8 , expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG for 20 h at 20°C . Cells were pelleted and resuspended in preparation buffer ( 300 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 ) supplemented with 2 mg / ml lysozyme and protease inhibitors , and lysed with soni - cation . The lysate was then centrifuged at 96 , 000 g at 4°C for 30 min . The supernatant was incubated overnight with glutathione – Sepharose at 4°C before elution with 25 mM glutathione , 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 . Purified proteins were aliquoted , snap frozen in liquid ni - trogen , and stored at – 80°C . Actin was purified from chicken pectoralis skeletal muscle and gel filtered as described in ( Bryce et al . , 2005 ) . In brief , chicken muscle acetone powder was thawed and mixed in G - buf - fer containing 2 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 005 % NaN 3 , and 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 . The supernatant was collected by centrifu - gation at 16 , 000 rpm at 4°C for 30 min and filtered through glass wool before mixing with 50 mM KCl and 2 mM MgCl 2 at 4°C for 1 h to po - lymerize the actin . KCl was added to make the supernatant 0 . 8 M KCl to dissociate tropomyosin , and then ultracentrifuged at 38 , 000 rpm for 2 h . Pellets were resuspended in G - buffer , homogenized , and dialyzed overnight to depolymerize actin . Actin monomers were gel filtered by passing through a Superdex 200 column . Actin - containing fractions were collected , snap frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at − 80°C . Lipid overlay assay PIP strips were blocked in PBST ( 0 . 1 % Tween 20 [ vol / vol ] ) supple - mented with 3 % fatty acid - free BSA ( Sigma - Aldrich ) overnight at 4°C and then incubated with 0 . 5 µg / ml GST fusion proteins for 1 h at room temperature . After washes with PBST - BSA , the membranes were blotted with rabbit anti - GST for 1 h at room temperature , followed by IRDye 800 goat anti – rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h . Liposome binding assay For most experiments , 0 . 5 µg of purified GST fusion protein was in - cubated with 3 µM biotinylated liposomes composed of 5 % PIP lipids in 20 mM Hepes , 120 mM NaCl , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM KCl , and 1 mg / ml fatty acid - free BSA , pH 7 . 4 , for 15 min at room temperature . For the binding isotherm ( Fig . 1 D ) and com - JCB • VOLUME 210 • NUMBER 5 • 2015 766 petition assays ( Fig . 5 , E and F ) , 70 nM cortactin was used instead of 0 . 5 µg . Liposome – protein complexes were then further incubated with streptavidin - conjugated magnetic beads ( Invitrogen ) for 30 min at room temperature . After washing with binding buffer and isolation with a magnet , liposome - bound protein was analyzed by SDS - PAGE . The intensity of bands was quantified by ImageJ software ( NIH ) . To compare relative binding affinity of each protein to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , nonspe - cific bead binding band intensity ( beads only lane ) was subtracted from the specific liposome - bead band intensity , and then normalized by the intensity of the band in the input lane . Apparent equilibrium K d were calculated using a one - site binding hyperbola nonlinear regression analysis in Prism ( GraphPad , version 5 software ) . Arp2 / 3 complex - binding assay Purified GST or GST - fusion cortactin variants immobilized on glutathi - one beads , were incubated with 100 nM Arp2 / 3 complex in the binding buffer containing 20 mM Hepes , 60 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mg / ml BSA , pH 7 . 4 , for 10 min at room temperature . Beads were washed three times with binding buffer , and bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS - PAGE loading buffer . Bound Arp2 / 3 complex was detected by Western blotting with anti - Arp2 polyclonal antibody . F - actin co - sedimentation assay F - actin was prepared from monomers by polymerization in 80 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , for 1 h at room tempera - ture . Next , 70 nM purified WT or mutant cortactin were incubated with 3 µM F - actin in polymerization buffer . After 10 min at room temperature , cortactin bound to actin filaments was separated from free cortactin by ultracentrifugation for 20 min at 175 , 000 g . Next , the supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by Western blot - ting using anti - GST antibody . PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - F - actin competition assay 3 µM F - actin was prepared from monomers by polymerization in 80 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 for 1 h at room temperature . Next , various concentrations of actin filaments ( 0 – 1 . 5 µM ) prepared by dilution with polymerization buffer were incubated with 250 nM PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - containing liposomes and 70 nM cortactin and then processed as for the liposome binding assay . GraphPad software was used for nonlinear regression analysis of datasets , and K i was calcu - lated using one - phase exponential decay equation . Actin TIRF assay Glass flow chambers were constructed from glass coverslips ( 24 × 40 mm and 22 × 22 mm ; no . 1 . 5 ) using doubled - sided tape ( 3M ) . Cover - slips were cleaned for 10 min with plasma cleaner and 30 min bath in 0 . 1 M KOH , and then coated with methoxy - polyethylene glycol - silane ( mPEG - Silane - 5K , Creative PEGworks ; 0 . 1 % in 95 % ethanol , 0 . 1 % HCl ) overnight at room temperature . The mPEG - Silane coating was used to minimize filament binding to the chamber surface . The cham - bers were washed twice each with high then low salt buffer solutions ( 1 % [ wt / vol ] BSA , 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , and 600 / 150 mM NaCl , re - spectively ) , followed by two washes with 1× TIRF buffer . The 1× TIRF buffer contained MKEI ( 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA , 20 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 ) , 15 mM glucose , 100 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 % 4000 cP methylcellulose , 20 µg / ml catalase , 0 . 1 mg / ml glu - cose oxidase , and 0 . 1 % BSA . Glucose oxidase , catalase , and BSA were added just before use . Actin polymerization reactions were initiated by adding a protein solution containing the proteins ( Arp2 / 3 complex , GST - VCA , cortactin , or PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - liposome ) in 1× TIRF buffer to a solution of 4 . 5 µM 33 % Oregon Green actin mixed with 50 µM MgCl 2 and 200 µM EGTA to give a final reaction solution of 0 . 75 µM 33 % Or - egon Green actin . Images were collected on a TiE inverted microscope ( Nikon ) equipped with a 100× / 1 . 49 NA TIRF objective ( Nikon ) , and Evolve EM - CCD camera ( Photometrics ) . The 1 . 5× optivar was used for all images except for PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 condition ( 1× ) to increase magnifi - cation . A 488 - nm laser was used to excite Oregon Green . Images were acquired with Elements software ( Nikon ) . Debranching assay Polymerization reactions were initiated by mixing 3 µM G - actin with 100 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and 600 nM GST - VCA in polymerization buf - fer , and incubated for 8 min to form fully polymerized actin branches . At this time , rhodamine - phalloidin ( 0 min sample ) , 500 nM cortactin , 500 nM cortactin plus 500 nM PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - liposome , 500 nM cortactin plus 500 nM PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - liposome , or buffer was added , then further in - cubated for 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , or 30 min before adding equimolar ( 3 µM final concentration ) rhodamine - phalloidin ( from a 200 µM stock in methanol ) to stop filament debranching and stain the actin filaments . After 4 min of incubation with rhodamine - phalloidin , filaments were diluted into fluorescence buffer containing MKEI , 100 mM dithioth - reitol , 20 µg / ml catalase , 100 µg / ml glucose oxidase , 3 mg / ml glucose , and 0 . 5 % methylcellulose , 4000cp . 4 µl was applied to glass coverslips ( 22 × 22 mm , # 1 . 5 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Image were acquired with an Eclipse TE2000 - E widefield fluorescent microscope ( Nikon ) equipped with a Plan Apo 100× / 1 . 4 NA , oil immersion lens ( used in combination with x1 . 5 optivar ) , and a cooled charge - coupled device camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) using MetaMorph software . Branch - ing was analyzed by manually counting unbranched filaments and number of branching of filaments with one or more branches . Percent branching was then calculated by the following equation : percentage of branched filaments = ( number of branched filaments per field / num - ber of total filaments ) × 100 . Immunofluorescence and Image analysis Cells were fixed for 15 min in 4 % paraformaldehyde at 37°C and blocked and permeabilized with 5 % normal goat serum containing 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 for 1 h at room temperature . Primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 1 % BSA and 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 were added to cells for staining overnight at 4°C , followed by secondary antibody incubation for 1 h at room temperature . Cells were then mounted on slides with Aqua Poly / Mount mounting media ( Polyscience , Inc . ) . Im - ages were acquired at room temperature using an LSM Image browser software on a confocal microscope ( model LSM 510 ; Carl Zeiss ) , using a Plan - Apochromat 63× / 1 . 4 oil DIC objective and Argon2 , HeNe1 , and HeNe2 laser . Colocalization and intensity of single - plane images were quantitated using measure colocalization plug - in of MetaMorph soft - ware after thresholding images to remove background . Live cell imaging For visualization of the dynamic effect of YM201636 on endosomes , MDA - MB - 231 cells stably expressing mRFP - Rab7 were cultured on poly - D - Lysine - coated MatTek dishes overnight . Before imaging , they were serum starved in DMEM for 3 h , and then 800 nM YM201636 was added . 20 min after drug treatment , images were captured every 10 s for 75 min on a confocal microscope ( model LSM 710 ; Carl Zeiss ) using a 63× / 1 . 40 Plan - Apochromat oil objective and Argon - 488 and HeNe - 561 laser under 5 % CO 2 at 37°C . For the analysis the stability of actin on endosomes , MDA - MB - 231 cells stably expressing mRFP - Rab7 were transfected with the actin probe mGFP - F - tractin . Next , cells were cultured on 35 - mm glass bottom dishes ( no . 1 . 5 ; In Vitro Scientific ) overnight . After 2 - h incubation of cells with DMSO or YM201636 , 10 µM latrunculin A was added and images were captured every 2 s with SoftWoRx software on a DeltaVision deconvolution mi - PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 regulates cortactin – actin interactions • Hong et al . 767 croscope ( Applied Precision ) equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ2 camera ( Photometrics ) , and a UPSLAPO 100× / 1 . 4 NA oil immersion objec - tive . Individual raw files were deconvoluted using Applied Precision SoftWoRx deconvolution package . Fluorescence intensity of individ - ual endosomal mGFP - F - tractin spots were tracked over time using the manual tracking plugin of Fiji software . Individual endosomal actin spots , adjacent cytosolic background , and background outside the cell were compared for each time point using this plugin to measure pixel intensities . For data plots , the background intensity outside of the cell was subtracted at each time point and the ratio of endosomal to cy - tosolic mGFP - F - tractin intensity was plotted . Data were fitted with a one - phase decay equation model using GraphPad Prism software to determine the half - life ( t 1 / 2 ) of endosomal actin . Analysis of PI lipids in cells As a positive control , Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( w303 strain ) was grown in 2 ml complete synthetic medium with 30 µCi / ml 3 [ H ] - ino - sitol ( Perkin Elmer ) overnight at 30°C to reach saturation . Half of the cultures were osmotically shocked by adding KCl ( 1M ) for 10 min to induce PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis . Lipids from the harvested yeasts were extracted and deacylated ( Bird , 1994 ) . For MDA - MB - 231 cells , 5 × 10 5 cells / 60 - mm dish were seeded and grown at 37°C overnight before washing with inositol - free DMEM - H medium ( MP Biomedicals ) , and growing in 5 ml of inositol - free DMEM - H with 30 µCi / ml 3 [ H ] - inositol and 10 % dialyzed FBS for 3 d to reach full confluence . Cellular lipids were then extracted and deacylated . The deacylated lipids were ana - lyzed by HPLC on a Partisphere SAX column ( 4 . 6 × 125 mm ; What - man ) using the following buffer profile : 10 mM NH 4 H 2 PO 4 ( pH 3 . 5 , buffer A ) for 7 min , 0 – 7 % buffer B ( 1 . 7 M NH 4 H 2 PO 4 , pH 3 . 5 ) in the next 3 min , 7 – 14 % buffer B in the next 15 min , then 14 – 60 % buffer B for the next 10 min , and followed by 60 – 100 % buffer B for another 15 min . The flow rate throughout the gradient was 1 ml / min , and 1 - ml fractions from the column were quantified by scintillation counting . Data graphing and statistical analysis Graphs were generated using Prism GraphPad version 5 . Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22 . All data were tested for normality using a Kolmogorov - Smirnov normality test . Data with a normal distribution were analyzed using a two - tailed Student’s t test and plotted using mean + standard error bar graphs . Data with a nonnor - mal ( nonparametric ) distribution were analyzed using a Mann - Whitney U test and presented as box and whiskers plots with the box indicating the 25th and 75th percentiles , solid line indicating the median , and the whiskers indicating the 95 % confidence intervals .
