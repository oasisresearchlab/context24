Podocytes are important for glomerular ﬁ ltration barrier function and maintenance of size selectivity in protein ﬁ ltration in the kidney . Podocyte damage is the basis of many glomerular diseases charac - terized by loss of interdigitating foot processes and de - creased expression of components of the slit diaphragm . Nephrin , a podocyte - speci ﬁ c protein , is the main compo - nent of the slit diaphragm . Loss of nephrin is observed in human and rodent models of diabetic kidney disease . The long isoform of CIN85 ( RukL ) is a binding partner of nephrin that mediates nephrin endocytosis via ubiquiti - nation in podocytes . Here we demonstrate that the loss of nephrin expression and the onset of proteinuria in diabetic mice correlate with an increased accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and expression of CIN85 / RukL in podocytes . CIN85 / RukL de ﬁ ciency preserved nephrin surface expression on the slit diaphragm and reduced proteinuria in diabetic mice , whereas overexpression of CIN85 in zebra ﬁ sh induced severe edema and disruption of the ﬁ ltration barrier . Thus , CIN85 / RukL is involved in endocytosis of nephrin in podocytes under diabetic con - ditions , causing podocyte depletion and promoting pro - teinuria . CIN85 / RukL expression therefore shows potential to be a novel target for antiproteinuric therapy in diabetes . Diabetic nephropathy ( DN ) is a common cause of end - stage renal failure and is epidemic worldwide ( 1 ) . The clinical hallmark of DN is proteinuria , which is considered to play a central role in the pathogenesis of progressive renal dysfunction . Over the past few decades , mesangial cells and the glomerular basement membrane ( GBM ) have tended to be the focus of many DN studies . Glomerular changes in DN are characterized by glomerular hyper - trophy , mesangial matrix expansion , and GBM thicken - ing . Studies of patients with diabetes and experimental models reveal that the onset albuminuria is most closely associated with podocytopathies such as foot process ef - facement , podocyte hypertrophy , detachment , apoptosis , and transdifferentiation ( 2 – 5 ) . Because the terminally dif - ferentiated podocytes are believed to play a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the glomerular ﬁ ltration barrier , podocyte effacement may contribute to the development of albuminuria . Although structural proteins were initially thought to be the key elements that compose the slit di - aphragm , it has become clear that the slit diaphragm protein complex is a highly dynamic functional protein complex and is able to initiate cascades of signaling pathways that affect podocyte function ( 6 ) . More recent data indicate that podo - cytes express receptors for many circulating hormones and growth factors , which also suggest that a more complex cross talk between the kidney and other organs affected by diabetes may occur in health and disease ( 7 ) . Nephrin is a 180 - kDa transmembrane protein predom - inantly localized to the glomerular slit diaphragm . Its presence is essential for primary structural function of the slit diaphragm ( 8 ) . Nephrin may also act as a signaling adhesion molecule , triggering phosphorylation and activation of several kinase cascades ( 9 ) . Nephrin signaling is augmented by its interaction with podocin . During the early stage of human and experimental DN , podocytes lose nephrin ex - pression , become effaced , and detach from the GBM or undergo apoptosis , events that correlate with the emer - gence of albuminuria ( 3 , 10 ) . 1 Division of Nephrology , Department of Medicine , Hannover Medical School , Hannover , Germany 2 Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory , Salisbury Cove , ME 3 Institute of Biochemistry II , Goethe University Frankfurt , Frankfurt , Germany Corresponding author : Mario Schiffer , schiffer . mario @ mh - hannover . de .

Diabetes Volume 65 , December 2016 3667 C O M P L I C A T I O N S Regulator of ubiquitous kinase / Cbl - interacting protein of 85 kDa ( Ruk / CIN85 ) is known as an adaptor pro - tein belonging to the CD2AP family , which is involved in clathrin - mediated receptor endocytosis of receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) ( 11 , 12 ) . In rodents and humans , Ruk / CIN85 is composed of three N - terminal Src homology ( SH ) do - mains , followed by one proline - rich domain and a COOH - terminal coiled - coil domain . The presence of these multiple protein - protein binding motifs allows the interaction of Ruk / CIN85 with various signaling molecules and , conse - quently , functional involvement in many intracellular net - works ( 13 ) . The CIN85 genomic locus gives rise to multiple isoforms , including CIN85 - xl , CIN85 - l ( CIN85 / RukL ) , CIN85 - D A , CIN85 - m , CIN85 - s , CIN85 - t , and CIN85 - h , as a result of alternative splicing and differential promoter usage ( 14 , 15 ) . CIN85 / RukL was identi ﬁ ed as an interaction part - ner of c - Cbl , an E3 ubiquitin ligase . c - Cbl ubiquitinates many cell surface receptors and , by means of this post - translational modi ﬁ cation , initiates their internalization , endocytic traf ﬁ cking , and sorting ( 16 , 17 ) . We previously de ﬁ ned CIN85 / RukL as a binding part - ner of nephrin and a mediator of nephrin endocytosis ( 18 ) . CIN85 / RukL binds nephrin through its SH3 domain . The expression of CIN85 is posttranscriptionally regu - lated via ubiquitination or small ubiquitin - like modi ﬁ er ( SUMO ) ylation ( 19 ) and is described to regulate ubiquiti - nation and several types of degradative endosomal sort - ing . So far , most conclusions about the involvement of CIN85 / RukL in endocytosis and other traf ﬁ cking events are based on studies in CD2AP - knockout cells or arti ﬁ cial overexpression studies of this protein . In this study , we ﬁ rst detect a glucose - induced expression induction of en - dogenous CIN85 / RukL and investigate the role of CIN85 / RukL in diabetes in vivo in CIN85 D ex2 mice . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Antibodies The antibodies used for Western blot analysis , immuno - precipitation , immuno ﬂ uorescence , and immunohistochem - istry were as follows : rabbit anti - nephrin ( targeting for the extracellular domain ) , rabbit anti - CD2AP , rabbit anti - GAPDH ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , mouse anti - ubiquitin ( Imgenex , San Diego , CA ) , mouse anti - CIN85 ( Upstate ) , rabbit anti - SUMO - 1 ( Cell Signaling ) , guinea pig anti - nephrin ( Progen , Heidelberg , Germany ) , and mouse anti - CIN85 ( gift from I . D . ) . Peroxidase - conjugated donkey anti - rabbit , goat anti - mouse , and unconjugated rabbit IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology . Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti - guinea pig and Alexa Fluor 555 don - key anti - mouse antibodies were from Invitrogen . Podocyte Culture Cultivation of conditionally immortalized wild - type , CD2AP 2 / 2 , and CIN85 D ex2 murine podocytes was per - formed as previously described by Mundel and Reiser ( 20 ) . In brief , to enhance expression of the thermosensitive large T antigen , cells were cultured at 33°C in the presence of 10 units / mL g - interferon ( permissive conditions ) . To in - duce differentiation , podocytes were maintained at 37°C for 10 – 14 days without g - interferon , leading to degradation of thermosensitive T antigen ( nonpermissive conditions ) . The results for every experimental setup were con ﬁ rmed in three different clones of wild - type , CD2AP 2 / 2 , and CIN85 D ex2 mu - rine podocytes . Western Blot Analysis To analyze whole - cell protein lysates from cultured podocytes , they were lysed on ice with radioimmunoprecipitation assay ( RIPA ) buffer ( 50 mmol / L Tris [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 150 mmol / L NaCl , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , and 0 . 1 % SDS ) containing protease inhibitors ( cOmplete Mini , Roche Applied Science ) , 1 mmol / L sodium orthovanadate , 50 mmol / L NaF , and 200 ng / mL okadaic acid . The lysates were centrifuged 15 min at 12 , 000 rpm and 4°C . Protein was quanti ﬁ ed using the BCA Protein Assay Kit ( Pierce Chemical Co . , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , Inc . ) . Samples from the supernatants were separated by 10 % SDS - PAGE and transferred to polyviny - lidene di ﬂ uoride membranes ( Immobilon - P ; Millipore , Bed - ford , MA ) . After samples were probed with primary antibodies , antigen - antibody complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase – labeled anti - rabbit or anti - mouse secondary antibodies and visualized using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol . Ubiquitination Assay ( Immunoprecipitation ) Podocytes were subcultured on plates and differentiated for 14 days . The cells were carefully washed with ice - cold PBS and lysed with 300 m L RIPA buffer ( 50 mmol / L Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 150 mmol / L NaCl , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycho - late , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , and 0 . 1 % SDS ) containing protease inhibitor ( Roche Applied Science ) . The lysates were ro - tated for 60 min at 4°C and centrifuged at 14 , 000 rpm for 15 min . Agarose - A beads ( 50 m L ; Santa Cruz Biotech - nology ) and nephrin ( 5 m L ) were added to at least 500 m g of total cell lysate with concentration of 1 m g / m L . The samples were rotated overnight at 4°C . The pellets were washed three times with RIPA buffer and separated by SDS - PAGE . Endocytosis Assay Using ELISA Adenovirus - infected human podocytes or murine podocytes were seeded in a 24 - well plate coated with poly - L - lysine ( 1 : 1 diluted with H 2 O ) . To induce internalization , cells were in - cubated with 30 mmol / L high glucose or mannitol medium for 2 or 24 h at 37°C . The plates were cooled on ice for 10 – 15 min . The medium was replaced with DFH medium ( 1 % FCS and 20 mmol / L HEPES in RPMI 1640 medium ) con - taining 1 : 500 rabbit anti - nephrin antibody . Please note the two DFH solutions differ only slightly in HEPES concentra - tion . The cells were incubated for 60 min at 4°C and then washed three times with cold DFHI medium ( 1 % FCS and 25 mmol / L HEPES in RPMI 1640 medium ) . The cells were then ﬁ xed with 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min , washed twice with PBS , and kept overnight at 4°C . For blocking , 2 % 3668 CIN85 De ﬁ ciency Prevents Nephrin Endocytosis Diabetes Volume 65 , December 2016 normal goat serum ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) in PBS was used for at least 30 min . Cells were washed once with PBS and were incubated in PBS with alkaline phosphatase - coupled anti - rabbit antibody ( dilution 1 : 7 , 500 ) for 1 h and washed three times with PBS , with each wash 5 – 10 min . The cells were then incubated with p - nitrophenyl phosphate ( N2765 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) by resuspending one tablet in 20 mL of 0 . 1 mol / L glycine , 1 mmol / L MgCl 2 , and 1 mmol / L ZnCl 2 ( pH 10 . 4 ) for ; 1 h at 37°C or until the solution turned yellow . One aliquot ( 100 m L ) from the reaction was transferred into a well of a 96 - well plate , and the extinction was measured at 405 nm in a microplate reader ( Tecan ) . Immuno ﬂ uorescence and Histochemistry For immuno ﬂ uorescence staining of frozen kidneys , 6 - m m sections ( Leica CM3050S cryostat ; Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) were ﬁ xed in acetone , or 1 . 5 - m m par - af ﬁ n sections were deparaf ﬁ nized , and antigen retrieval was performed by heating in citrate buffer ( 10 mmol / L sodium citrate , pH 6 . 0 ) in a microwave or by digesting with 1 mg / mL trypsin ( T7168 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . For im - muno ﬂ uorescence staining , unspeci ﬁ c binding was blocked with 10 % donkey serum 30 min at room temperature . Sections were incubated with the primary antibodies as indicated overnight at 4°C , after rinsing with TBS ( 50 mmol / L Tris and 150 mmol / L NaCl , pH 7 . 4 – 7 . 6 ) . The sections were incubated with ﬂ uorescence - conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 30 min and mounted with Aqua Poly ( Polysciences , Inc . ) . The histoimmunochemical staining was performed with the VECTASTAIN ABC Kit and ACE peroxidase substrate kit ( Vector Laboratories , Inc . ) according to the manufac - turer ’ s instructions . PCR Total mRNA was isolated from podocytes using an RNA kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions , after which 1 m g RNA was reverse transcribed with random and hexamer primers and T reverse transcrip - tase ( Promega ) . Primers for detecting mRNA expression of CIN85 full length were described by Buchman et al . ( 14 ) : CIN85 m1 : forward 5 9 - TTCCGCCAACTTTCACTCTG - 3 9 , and CIN85 mmn : reverse 5 9 - GGCAGGAAGTCATTTTCCAC - 3 9 . HPRT - 1 : forward 5 9 - CAGTCCCAGCGTCGTGATTA - 3 9 and reverse 5 9 - AGCAAGTCTTTCAGTCCTGTC - 3 9 were used as an internal control to correct for small variations in mRNA quality and cDNA synthesis . Animal Experiments Ethics Statement Animal work was conducted according to the guidelines of the American Physiological Society and was approved by the Hannover Medical School Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Animal Welfare Authorities of Lower Saxony ( Protocol # 11 / 0545 ) . All efforts were made to min - imize the number of animals used and their suffering . The mice received a standard diet with free access to tap water . Genotyping Genomic DNA samples from tail biopsy specimens were used . PCR was performed under standard conditions in a Primus Thermocycler ( MWG - Biotech AG , Ebersberg , Ger - many ) with the following primer pairs : CIN85 neo forward : 5 9 - GCTGCTATTGGGCGAAGTG - 3 9 , CIN85 wild - type for - ward 5 9 - AGGGAGGATGGAGGCTGGTG - 3 9 , and CIN85 wild - type reverse : 5 9 - GATGAAGGCAAGTCTATGAGGA - 3 9 . Streptozocin - Induced Type 1 Diabetic Mice C57BL / 6J wild - type and CIN85 D ex2 mice ( gift from I . D . ) were intraperitoneally injected with 50 mg / kg streptozocin ( STZ ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) diluted in 50 mmol / L sodium citrate ( Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) buffer ( pH 4 . 5 ) or with sodium citrate buffer for 5 consecutive days . Glucose levels from tail blood were measured with Glucometer Elite ( Bayer , Leverkusen , Germany ) every other day . The glucose levels were moni - tored 4 weeks after injection and then every week until the animals were hyperglycemic for 16 weeks . Animals with glucose levels exceeding 16 mmol / L on two consecutive measurements were regarded as hyperglycemic . The mice were not supplied with insulin during the experiment . Microalbuminuria and Creatinine Measurement Urine of each mouse was collected in metabolic cages and was analyzed for albuminuria and creatinine content using commercially available kits ( Bethyl Laboratories , Inc . and Exocell , Inc . ) . The measurements were performed according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol . Zebra ﬁ sh Experiments Zebra ﬁ sh were mated and embryos housed at 28 . 5°C in embryo - rearing media ( E3 ) . The Nanoject II injection device ( Drummond Scienti ﬁ c , Broomall , PA ) was used to inject 4 . 6 nL capped RNA for murine CIN85 and CD2AP diluted 1 : 1 with injection buffer ( 20 mmol / L HEPES , 200 mmol / L KCl , and 0 . 75 % phenol red ) into one - to four - cell stage fertilized embryos at different concentrations . The capped RNAs were synthesized using mMESSAGE mMACHINE kits ( Ambion ) according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol . Because capped RNA has a 7 - methyl guanosine cap structure at the 5 9 end , it mimics most eukaryotic mRNAs found in vivo . For observation of proteinuria , we used the Tg ( l - fabp : DBP - EGFP ) transgenic zebra ﬁ sh line as previously described ( 21 , 22 ) . Fluorescence of eGFP - labeled vitamin D – binding protein ( eGFP - DBP ) was measured in zebra ﬁ sh embryos at 96 hours after fertilization . The ﬂ uorescence intensity was analyzed with ImageJ software . Animal work was conducted according to the guidelines of the American Physiological Society and was approved by Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory ( Salisbury Cove , ME ) Insti - tutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC protocol # 0804 ) . All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering . Transmission Electron Microscopy of Zebra ﬁ sh Larval zebra ﬁ sh injected with capped mRNA were sampled at 120 h after fertilization and ﬁ xed in 1 . 5 % glutaraldehyde / 1 % diabetes . diabetesjournals . org Teng and Associates 3669 paraformaldehyde , 70 mmol / L NaH 2 PO 4 , and 3 % sucrose ( pH 7 . 2 ) . The embryos were washed three times in 0 . 2 mol / L cacodylate buffer and then post ﬁ xed in 1 % os - mium tetroxide for 1 h at room temperature . The speci - mens were rinsed with cacodylate buffer , dehydrated in a graded ethanol series , and in ﬁ ltrated and embedded with Epon ( Hard Plus Resin 812 ; Electron Microscopy Sciences , Hat ﬁ eld , PA ) according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol . Thin - sections of 0 . 5 and 1 m m were generated with a Leica RM2165 rotary microtome and stained with 0 . 5 % tolui - dine blue in a 1 % sodium tetraborate solution . When the pronephros was identi ﬁ ed on toluidine blue staining , ul - trathin ( 80 - to 100 - nm - thick ) sections of the kidney were cut and mounted on slot grids ( Luxel , Friday Harbor , WA ) . The sections were stained with 2 % uranyl acetate in dis - tilled water and contrasted with lead citrate . Sections were viewed and photographed on a JEOL - 1230 transmission electron microscope ( Eching , Germany ) and an attached charge - coupled device camera . Clinical Renal Biopsy Samples Renal tissue was obtained from the archives of the Hann - over Medical School Department of Pathology . Paraf ﬁ n - embedded specimens of normal kidney from nephrectomies performed for tumor and renal biopsy samples from adults with DN were included . The renal specimens were used in accordance with the ethical standards of the Hannover Medical School and with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975 , as revised in 1983 . All patients consented at hospital admission to experiments on their anonymized archived tissue samples . Statistics The statistical analysis of data was performed with the table calculation program in Microsoft Excel or with GraphPad Prism software . Average and SEM were calculated for each datum . SEM is shown as an error bar . We used the unpaired Student t test to compare the results of each single test group . A P value of , 0 . 05 was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant . RESULTS Upregulation of Glomerular CIN85 / RukL in Experimental and Human DN High glucose is known to induce podocyte injury , yet the mechanisms remain largely elusive . To determine the regulatory effect of high glucose on podocyte slit dia - phragm proteins , we examined the expression of CIN85 / RukL , CD2AP , and nephrin in murine and human podocytes using Western blot analysis ( Fig . 1 ) . CIN85 / RukL expres - sion began to increase 24 h after high glucose stimulation ( P , 0 . 05 ) and reached the highest level at 48 h ( P # 0 . 01 ) in both cell lines ( Fig . 1 A and C ) . High glucose stimulation upregulated CIN85 expression by twofold but decreased the expression of CD2AP and nephrin . In contrast , treatment with mannitol as an osmotic control had no effect on the expression of these three proteins ( Fig 1 B and D ) . These results suggest that high glucose changes the expression balance of CD2AP and CIN85 / RukL , leading to a downregu - lation of nephrin expression in murine and human podocytes . SUMOylation of CIN85 Is Changed in Diabetes To examine the alteration of CIN85 / RukL expression and its posttranscriptional modi ﬁ cation in experimental animal models of diabetes , 8 - week - old C57BL / 6J mice were injected with low - dose STZ to induce type 1 diabetes . At 16 weeks after diabetes induction , dual immuno ﬂ uorescence staining of mouse kidney cortex sections with antibodies against CIN85 and SUMO - 1 revealed a signi ﬁ cantly upregulated expression of CIN85 in the glomeruli ( Fig . 2 A ) . Colocalization of CIN85 and SUMO - 1 in C57BL / 6J mice suggests that CIN85 is SUMOylated under normal conditions . SUMO - 1 expression is distributed throughout the glomerulus under normal conditions but was predominantly restricted to the nucleus in diabetic glomeruli , indicating that CIN85 is released from SUMO - 1 in diabetic glomeruli . To con ﬁ rm these results , we performed immunoprecipitation of endog - enous SUMO - 1 and endogenous CIN85 from glomerular lysates isolated from CD2AP - knockout mice , wild - type mice , and diabetic mice ( Fig . 2 D ) . The immunoprecipitation demonstrated a reduced SUMOylation in diabetic mice ; moreover , CD2AP expression was also signi ﬁ cantly down - regulated . Therefore , upregulated expression of CIN85 coin - cides with downregulation of CD2AP and reduced SUMOylation . Dual immuno ﬂ uorescence staining of mouse kidney cortex sections with antibody against CIN85 and nephrin revealed signi ﬁ cantly upregulated expression of CIN85 in the glomeruli ( Fig . 2 B ) and a reduction of nephrin expres - sion . Decreased nephrin indicated a possible degradation of nephrin under diabetic conditions , which is associated with podocyte injury and proteinuria . Partial colocalization of CIN85 with nephrin indicates CIN85 - positive podocytes . To investigate the CIN85 expression and localization in the glomeruli of patients with DN , immunoperoxidase staining was performed with human biopsy samples against anti - bodies recognizing CIN85 ( Fig . 2 C ) . CIN85 expression was barely detectable in glomeruli from normal control kidneys but was strongly upregulated in glomeruli from patients with DN ( n = 5 ) . Moreover , CIN85 staining localized spe - ci ﬁ cally to human podocytes under disease conditions . To con ﬁ rm that colocalization of nephrin and CIN85 is due to their interaction , we performed coimmunoprecipi - tation of endogenous CIN85 with nephrin in C57BL / 6J mice ( Fig . 2 E ) and in cultured human podocytes ( Fig . 2 F ) . We detected a weak interaction of CIN85 with nephrin that was robustly induced when the mice were diabetic or the human podocytes were exposed to high glucose for 48 h . Collectively , these results suggest CIN85 may be a biolog - ical marker for podocyte injury in experimental and in human DN . Absence of CIN85 Exon2 Preserves Expression of Nephrin Under Diabetic Conditions CIN85 D ex2 mice , which lack the two major CIN85 isoforms expressed in the kidney ( CIN85 - xl and CIN85 / RukL ) ( 23 ) , 3670 CIN85 De ﬁ ciency Prevents Nephrin Endocytosis Diabetes Volume 65 , December 2016 were used to investigate the function of CIN85 / RukL in DN . Homozygous CIN85 D ex2 mice displayed no obvious renal phenotype abnormalities . C57BL / 6J mice and CIN85 D ex2 mice were injected with low - dose STZ to induce diabetes . At 16 weeks after STZ injection , we collected the spot urine and sacri ﬁ ced the mice . Under diabetic conditions , nephrin was dramatically downregu - lated and lost much of its characteristic expression pat - tern . Strikingly , nephrin staining in sections from CIN85 D ex2 mice was preserved ( Fig . 3 A ) . When we examined Figure 1 — Time course of CIN85 , CD2AP , and nephrin expression after glucose or mannitol stimulation in murine and human podocytes . Human and murine podocytes were exposed to 30 mmol / L high glucose or mannitol as osmotic control at the times indicated ( 0 – 48 h ) . Western blotting analysis depicts the expression of CIN85 , CD2AP , and nephrin in murine podocytes ( A and B ) and human podocytes ( C and D ) ( results are representative for three independent experiments ) . Expression level of CIN85 , CD2AP , and nephrin were quanti ﬁ ed by densitometry ( right panels ) . High glucose augmented CIN85 expression in a time - dependent manner and reached the highest level at 48 h in murine ( A ) and human ( C ) podocytes , whereas a downregulated expression of CD2AP and nephrin was detected as early as 24 h after stimulation .

D : Downregulated SUMOylation of CIN85 in glomeruli of diabetic mice . Antibodies against SUMO - 1 were used for immunoprecipitation ( IP ) experiments to detect interaction with glomerular lysates from CD2AP - knockout mice , nondiabetic C57BL / 6J mice ( 2 ) , and type 1 diabetic mice ( + indicates blood glucose level between 12 and 18 mmol / dL , + + indicates blood glucose level above 18 mmol / dL ) .

F : Increased interaction between nephrin and CIN85 upon high glucose stimulation in human podocytes in vitro .

Remarkably , these results showed albuminuria was not induced in diabetic CIN85 D ex2 mice compared with diabetic wild - type animals ( Fig . 3 B ) . Because CIN85 / RukL is a Cbl - interacting protein and Cbl directs ubiquitination of nephrin and mediates its endocytosis ( 24 ) , we performed an ubiquitination assay using immunoprecipitation with endogenous nephrin in human podocytes and then performed immunoblotting for ubiquitin ( Fig . 3 C ) . Ubiquitinated nephrin was not detected at baseline or when treated with mannitol . High glucose treatment , however , resulted in a signi ﬁ cant level of ubiquitinated nephrin with a major band above 180 kDa . Collagen IV deposition in the glomeruli of diabetic C57BL / 6J mice and diabetic CIN85 D ex2 mice was also examined ( Fig . 3 D ) . The Bowman capsule consists of the meshwork of type IV collagen , indicating a comparable ﬂ uorescence intensity in the stainings , whereas collagen IV deposition within the glomerular tuft region and mesangial area was only detectable in diabetic C57BL / 6J mice . Glomeruli were semiquantitively scored with a score of 1 to 4 , depending on the intensity and distribution of collagen IV staining . Strikingly , hyperglycemia induced less collagen IV deposition and sclerosis lesions in CIN85 D ex2 mice , resulting in a signi ﬁ cantly lower glomer - ular collagen IV score . CIN85 D ex2 diabetic mice received an average score of 2 . 5 , whereas the diabetic C57BL / 6J mice had an average score of 4 ( Fig . 3 D and E ) . Nephrin Endocytosis Is Impaired by CIN85 / CD2AP Balance Because CIN85 has been described to bind Cbl and recruit ubiquitin and to be involved in endocytosis of several tyrosine kinase transmembrane receptors , we wanted to prove that CIN85 / RukL is responsible for ubiquitination and endocytosis of nephrin under high glucose condi - tions . We demonstrated in our previous studies that CIN85 / RukL is involved in nephrin internalization and that the binding of CIN85 to nephrin is affected by the protein balance of CD2AP . To investigate the effect of high glucose on nephrin endocytosis in different podocyte cell lines , we generated conditionally immortalized wild - type podocytes and CIN85 D ex2 podocytes . The CIN85 D ex2 cells had a normal appearance under the light microscope ( Fig . 4 A ) and showed normal growth properties ( data not shown ) . We con ﬁ rm the absence of the CIN85 / RukL isoform by Western blot analysis ( Fig . 4 B ) , which was in agreement with the observed loss of exon 2 con ﬁ rmed by PCR ( Fig . 4 C ) . Because CIN85 / RukL interacts with nephrin and is involved in its internalization , we performed endocy - tosis assays and quanti ﬁ ed the endocytosis of nephrin in the absence of CIN85 / RukL protein using an ELISA - based endo - cytosis assay , as previously described ( 18 ) . We compared wild - type podocytes , CD2AP 2 / 2 podocytes , which have higher endogenously expressed CIN85 / RukL levels ( Fig . 4 B ) , and CIN85 D ex2 podocytes after 2 h of high glucose or man - nitol exposure . High glucose treatment of CD2AP 2 / 2 podo - cytes for 2 h induced a nearly twofold increase in nephrin endocytosis compared with the wild - type podocytes ; in con - trast , CIN85 D ex2 podocytes did not respond to high glucose stimulation ( Fig . 4 D ) . When we exposed the podocytes for 24 h , the nephrin endocytosis in wild - type podocytes was also signi ﬁ cantly induced after exposure to high glucose levels , whereas nephrin on the surface of CIN85 D ex2 podocytes was maintained even after high glucose stimulation for 24 h ( Fig . 4 E ) . Interestingly , the overexpression of CIN85 led to an increased endocytosis response in murine and human podocytes ( Fig . 4 F and G ) . CIN85 Overexpression Resulted in a Severe Edema and Proteinuria in Zebra ﬁ sh Embryos The results described above suggest a protective effect of CIN85 / RukL deletion on DN ; therefore , we wanted to examine whether CIN85 overexpression results in disrup - tion of the functional integrity of the glomerular ﬁ ltration barrier in vivo . Zebra ﬁ sh can be used as a comparative in vivo model because the ultrastructure of the zebra ﬁ sh glomerulus is indistinguishable to the human glomerulus . The glomerular ﬁ ltration barrier of zebra ﬁ sh is also composed of three parts — the fenestrated glomerular en - dothelial cells , the intervening GBM , and the interdigitat - ing foot processes of podocytes — and podocytic changes leading to effacement and proteinuria can be reproduced in zebra ﬁ sh larvae as well ( 22 ) . Overexpression was accomplished by injection of murine CIN85 - mRNA into 1 - to 4 - cell zebra ﬁ sh embryos . CIN85 overexpression resulted in morphological changes in the embryos , such as shortened body length and pericardial and yolk sac edema , compared with wild - type or CD2AP mRNA – overexpressing zebra ﬁ sh ( Fig . 5 A ) . The edema phenotype ( P ) was classi ﬁ ed into four categories : P1 , no edema ; P2 , mild edema ; P3 , severe edema ; and P4 , very severe edema ( Fig . 5 B ) . More than 95 % of the wild - type and CD2AP - overexpressing ﬁ sh had no edema ( P1 ) . However , with overexpression of CIN85 , a low dose of 7 . 5 ng resulted in ; 40 % edema , whereas with higher doses of mRNA , edema developed in more than 50 % of the larva . stimulation .

The integrity of the glomerular ﬁ ltration barrier of zebra ﬁ sh is assessed by measuring the retention or loss of transgenically overexpressed eGFP - DBP in the circulation of the zebra ﬁ sh embryos , as previously de - scribed ( 21 , 22 ) . A decrease in circulating eGFP - DBP is usually accompanied by foot process effacement and the appearance of eGFP - DBP – mediated ﬂ uorescence in the tank water , indicative of a compromised glomerular ﬁ l - tration barrier in the manipulated ﬁ sh . Compared with wild - type ﬁ sh , ﬁ sh overexpressing CIN85 exhibited a significant and dose - dependent decrease in circulating eGFP - DBP ( Fig . 5 C ) . Expression of murine CD2AP and CIN85 / RukL protein was con ﬁ rmed in zebra ﬁ sh embryos by Western blotting ( Fig . 5 D ) . To con ﬁ rm the phenotype is caused by disruption of the glomerular ﬁ lter , the ﬁ sh embryos were embedded , and ultrathin sections were examined by electron microscopy ( Fig . 5 E ) . The glomer - ulus of wild - type and CD2AP - overexpressing ﬁ sh showed well - structured podocyte foot processes with cross sec - tions of interdigitating foot processes and intact slit di - aphragms . However , CIN85 overexpression resulted in effacement of foot processes , indicating a detrimental effect of CIN85 / RukL expression on podocyte integrity . These results explain the decreased ﬂ uorescence in the circulation of the ﬁ sh with CIN85 / RukL overexpression , which indicates a direct effect of CIN85 expression on the podocyte phenotype in vivo . DISCUSSION We previously demonstrated that the paralogs CD2AP and CIN85 / RukL are functionally distinct in podocytes . Figure 5 — CIN85 expression impaired the integrity of the ﬁ ltration barrier in zebra ﬁ sh . Fertilized zebra ﬁ sh eggs were injected at the 1 - to 4 - cell stage with murine CIN85 or CD2AP - capped mRNA in the indicated concentrations . A : Phenotype of zebra ﬁ sh after CD2AP and CIN85 mRNA injection at 120 h after fertilization . The injected zebra ﬁ sh larvae showed a very severe generalized edema and pericardial effusion . B : Categorization of zebra ﬁ sh phenotype . At 120 h after fertilization , the phenotype of larvae was categorized into four groups : P1 , no edema ; P2 , mild edema ; P3 , severe edema ; and P4 , very severe edema ( n > 50 per condition ) . Compared with CD2AP mRNA – injected ﬁ sh with 90 % P1 phenotype , 7 . 5 ng CIN85 mRNA induced edema in ; 40 % of embryos , and 10 ng CIN85 mRNA led to edema in > 60 % of embryos ( n > 50 per condition ) .

Under normal conditions , the secondary foot process of podocytes can be visualized ( * ) . The black arrows depict slit diaphragms . GEC , glomerular endothelial cells . Scale bars : 500 nm . Control ﬁ sh and ﬁ sh injected with CD2AP mRNA displayed normal foot processes , whereas in zebra ﬁ sh injected with CIN85 mRNA , podocyte foot processes and slit diaphragms are lost ( effacement ) . 3676 CIN85 De ﬁ ciency Prevents Nephrin Endocytosis Diabetes Volume 65 , December 2016 Both proteins bind to the slit diaphragm protein nephrin , but whereas the interaction to CD2AP seems to stabilize the slit diaphragm complex , the interaction of nephrin and CIN85 / RukL leads to ubiquitination and internaliza - tion of nephrin ( 18 ) . We also previously described that the expression of CD2AP determines the expression level of free CIN85 / RukL in podocytes . In the presence of CD2AP , CIN85 / RukL is posttranslationally modi ﬁ ed by SUMO , and this modi ﬁ cation prevents its binding to nephrin ( 19 ) . Although our previous studies were mainly performed under conditions of CD2AP knockout , which is an extremely rare genetic defect in humans , we present here for the ﬁ rst time evidence that this pathway might be relevant to glomerular changes observed in diabetes . We can demonstrate a downregulation of CD2AP in mu - rine and human podocytes after exposure to high glucose . This is well in line with the observation of Ha et al . ( 25 ) who observed a phosphatidyl inositol 3 - kinase – dependent mechanism of CD2AP expression after high glucose expo - sure . At the same time , we detect a signi ﬁ cantly reduced nephrin expression as a consequence of high glucose ex - posure . This is consistent with previous observations , by us and others , that high glucose exposure leads to nephrin endocytosis in podocytes ( 26 , 27 ) . How nephrin speci ﬁ es clathrin - mediated endocytosis or raft - mediated endocyto - sis pathways and how these traf ﬁ cking routes are coordi - nated with the signaling function is still unclear . In vitro experiments with podocyte cell lines suggested that nephrin can undergo both clathrin - and raft - mediated endocytosis ( 28 ) . We hypothesize here that the observed downregula - tion of CD2AP has a secondary effect on the expression of full - length CIN85 / RukL in podocytes and that this contrib - utes to a continuous internalization of nephrin from the podocyte surface in diabetes ( Fig . 6 ) . Our hypothesis is supported by the following evidence . Firstly , we document a parallel downregulation of CD2AP and nephrin , which inversely correlates with the upregulated expression of CIN85 in two different cell lines , murine and human podocytes , after high glucose treatment in culture . Secondly , we demonstrate an upregulation of glomer - ular CIN85 expression in murine and human diabetes with a strong overlap in nephrin expression and a clear localization to podocytes . In addition , we detected a glucose - inducible interaction of CIN85 and nephrin in vitro . Our work provides the ﬁ rst study of mammalian diabetes in which loss of CIN85 is analyzed in vivo . The CIN85 - de ﬁ cient mice were generated by removing the two full - length isoforms CIN85 - xl and CIN85 / RukL by deletion of exon 2 . In the absence of these two protein isoforms , nephrin expression is preserved in the glomer - ulus and proteinuria is signi ﬁ cantly reduced . We further - more de ﬁ ned a glucose - induced ubiquitination response of nephrin , which explains the endocytosis and , pre - sumably , the degradation of nephrin . Although mono - ubiquitination of CIN85 / RukL is thought to regulate its interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligase c - Cbl and to target this adaptor together with activated transmembrane Figure 6 — Schema of CIN85 - induced nephrin endocytosis under diabetic conditions . In the presence of CD2AP , the complexes on the slit diaphragm are stabilized . Diabetes / high glucose downregulates CD2AP expression , which leads to increased full - length CIN85 expression . CIN85 is required for cbl - mediated ubiquitination and traf ﬁ cking of nephrin . Nephrin endocytosis leads to proteinuria . Deletion of CIN85 preserves the nephrin expression and ameliorates the proteinuria and glomerular matrix accumulation . diabetes . diabetesjournals . org Teng and Associates 3677 receptors for proteasomal degradation ( 29 ) , separate studies suggest that ubiquitination alone is not suf ﬁ cient to target CIN85 / RukL to proteasomes or to lysosomes ( 30 ) . Therefore , it is conceivable that additional steps follow that induce proteasomal degradation of nephrin . It is tempting to speculate that the monoubiquitination of nephrin is reversible and that other posttranslational pathways , such as SUMO , could orchestrate nephrin recycling back to the podocyte surface as we postulated earlier ( 19 ) . However , recycling is unlikely under sustained diabetic conditions . Thirdly , we provide additional in vitro evidence that the CIN85 / RukL levels in podocytes de ﬁ ne the level of glucose - induced nephrin endocytosis . Clearly CD2AP - knockout podocytes with an upregulated endogenous CIN85 / RukL level have the strongest endocytosis response after high glucose stimulation . Already 2 h after high glucose stim - ulation , we can detect a signi ﬁ cant increase in nephrin endocytosis . At that time , wild - type cells do not yet show a signi ﬁ cant endocytosis response . When we examine endo - cytosis 24 h after high glucose stimulation , we can detect signi ﬁ cant nephrin endocytosis also in wild - type cells . This is consistent with the upregulated concentration of CIN85 / RukL in wild - type cells detectable 24 h after high glucose exposure . In contrast , CIN85 D ex2 podocytes that do not express CIN85 / RukL do not show a signi ﬁ cant nephrin endocytosis response after 2 h or after 24 h , indicating that CIN85 / RukL is indispensable for the glucose - induced en - docytosis complex of slit diaphragm proteins . However , we hypothesize that nephrin is not only the target of CIN85 but also may be a trigger for endocytosis of several trans - membrane receptors or structure proteins . The endocytosis of nephrin seems to have severe consequences for the podocytes under diabetic conditions . In addition , neph - rin is most likely internalized in a complex with other slit diaphragm proteins that do not directly bind to CIN85 . Because we had previously observed in vitro that the arti ﬁ cial overexpression of CIN85 / RukL could induce an increased endocytosis of overexpressed nephrin in HEK cells ( 18 ) , we wanted to test whether overexpression of CIN85 / RukL could also induce proteinuria in vivo . We used the zebra ﬁ sh vertebrate system to accomplish this and induced expression of CIN85 / RukL by injection of in vitro transcribed murine mRNA . As a control , we injected CD2AP mRNA at the same concentration . The amino acid sequence identity of zebra ﬁ sh and murine CD2AP and CIN85 is 46 . 8 % and 70 . 4 % ( 71 % and 86 . 1 % similarity ) , respectively . Interestingly , overexpression of CIN85 / RukL induced a severe edema phenotype , signi ﬁ cant proteinuria , and foot process effacement in the injected zebra ﬁ sh em - bryos , whereas injection of similar concentrations of CD2AP mRNA had no detrimental effect on foot process architec - ture . The overexpression of CIN85 / RukL alone leads to a breakdown of podocyte foot process architecture , presum - ably through endocytosis of slit diaphragm components . This is the ﬁ rst report discussing the importance of CIN85 / RukL expression and the associated ubiquitination of slit diaphragm components in the context of a nonge - netic disease . The expression under high glucose condi - tions is clearly dependent on expression levels of CD2AP . Interestingly , a recent study reported that CD2AP vari - ants may be associated with susceptibility to end - stage renal disease in patients with type 1 diabetes ( 31 ) . Our results could serve as a ﬁ rst mechanistic insight of how gene variants of CD2AP could contribute to disease pro - gression in diabetic kidney disease . Thus , CIN85 / RukL could serve as a novel biomarker indicating diabetes / high glucose – induced stress in podocytes . Acknowledgments . The CIN85 D ex2 mice were gifts from I . D .
