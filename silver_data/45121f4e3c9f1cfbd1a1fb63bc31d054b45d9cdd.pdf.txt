Altered expression of this enzyme is frequently observed in cancer and accounts for the Warburg effect , an adaptive response of tumor cells to hypoxia . In addition to its catalytic function , ENO - 1 exhibits other activities , which strongly depend on its cellular and extracellular localization . For example , the association of ENO - 1 with mitochondria membrane was found to be important for the stability of the mitochondrial membrane , and ENO - 1 sequestration on the cell surface was crucial for plasmin - mediated pericellular proteolysis . The latter activity of ENO - 1 enables many pathogens but also immune and cancer cells to invade the tissue , leading further to infection , inﬂammation or metastasis formation . The ability of ENO - 1 to conduct so many diverse processes is reﬂected by its contribution to a high number of pathologies , including type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular hypertrophy , fungal and bacterial infections , cancer , systemic lupus erythematosus , hepatic ﬁbrosis , Alzheimer’s disease , rheumatoid arthritis , and systemic sclerosis . These unexpected non - catalytic functions of ENO - 1 and their contributions to diseases are the subjects of this review . Keywords : enolase - 1 , multitasking protein , glycolysis , protein compartmentalization , cancer INTRODUCTION Enolase is a metalloenzyme that catalyzes the inter - conversion of 2 - phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate within glycolysis . This enzymatic reaction is reversible and depends on the concentration of the substrates available in the environment ( Wold and Ballou , 1957a , b ) . Three isotypes of this enzyme have been described in mammals thus far : α - enolase ( ENO - 1 ) , ubiquitously expressed in most of the tissues , β - enolase ( ENO - 3 ) , expressed primary in muscle tissue and γ - enolase ( ENO - 2 ) , present mostly in neural tissues . All three isotypes form homo - dimers utilizing two magnesium ions non - covalently bound to the active site ( Marangos et al . , 1978 ; Brewer , 1981 ; Pancholi , 2001 ) . In general , glycolytic enzymes are evolutionary highly conserved proteins , exhibiting up to 40 – 90 % amino acid sequence homology among species ( Pancholi , 2001 ) . Although most of the glycolytic enzymes could be considered as housekeeping proteins , expression of ENO - 1 has been found to dramatically vary depending on the pathological , stress , or metabolic state of the cell . This ENO - 1 characteristic has been highlighted in a retrospective study analyzing 169 Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 1 April 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 61 fcell - 07 - 00061 April 25 , 2019 Time : 16 : 39 # 2 Didiasova et al . Compartmentalization of Enolase - 1 articles published in the ﬁeld of proteomics between 2004 and 2006 . The authors of this report demonstrated that ENO - 1 is the most diﬀerentially expressed protein in humans regardless of a tissue type and a pathological condition ( Petrak et al . , 2008 ) . Consequently , several pathologies with distinct etiologies reported disturbed expression and / or activity of this enzyme . For instance , altered levels of ENO - 1 has been demonstrated in Alzheimer’s disease ( Castegna et al . , 2002 ; Butterﬁeld and Lange , 2009 ; Owen et al . , 2009 ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( Kinloch et al . , 2005 ; Montes et al . , 2011 ) , systemic sclerosis ( Terrier et al . , 2010 ; Mehra et al . , 2013 ) , type 2 diabetes ( Li et al . , 2013 , 2015 ) , systemic lupus erythematosus ( Hawro et al . , 2015 ; Li et al . , 2018 ) , hepatic ﬁbrosis ( Peng et al . , 2013 ; Zhang et al . , 2013 ) , and fungal and bacterial infections ( Bergmann et al . , 2013 ; Funk et al . , 2016 ; Ji et al . , 2016 ) . In addition , ENO - 1 has been found to be overexpressed in more than 20 types of human cancer ( Altenberg and Greulich , 2004 ) . This ﬁnding can be partially explained by the Warburg eﬀect ( Vander Heiden et al . , 2009 ) , a process , in which cancer cells switch from oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic glycolysis under hypoxic conditions . However , recent observations have brought interest on the non - catalytic functions of ENO - 1 ( Pancholi , 2001 ; Diaz - Ramos et al . , 2012 ; Ji et al . , 2016 ) . This glycolytic enzyme ( primary localized in the cytoplasm ) has been detected at diﬀerent unexpected sites of the cell , driving such diverse processes as plasminogen binding , maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane stability , RNA chaperone activity and signal transduction . The latter has been found to be associated with the release of ENO - 1 to the extracellular space . The ability of ENO - 1 to execute more than one function , depending on its cellular localization , opened the door for ENO - 1 to the family of the moonlighting proteins . These unexpected functions of ENO - 1 will be discussed in this review . ENO - 1 Function in Cytoplasm The primary function of ENO - 1 is its catalytic contribution to glycolysis in the cytoplasm . For the detailed biochemical course of this reaction please refer to Qin et al . ( 2012 ) . Although ENO - 1 catalyzes the semi - ﬁnal step of glycolysis , this enzyme desires more then just an ordinary membership in the long list of glycolytic enzymes . A study by Capello et al . ( 2016 ) , revealed that silencing of ENO - 1 has a dramatic impact on the overall metabolic state of the cell . Proteomic proﬁling of human pancreatic cancer cells demonstrated that ENO - 1 knockdown induces a metabolic shift in these cells . Speciﬁcally , ENO - 1 silencing promoted β - oxidation of fatty acids , amino acid catabolism , and nucleotide base synthesis . Furthermore , ENO - 1 depleted cancer cells evaded the “glycolytic shutoﬀ” by enhancing mitochondrial electron ﬂux followed by increased oxygen consumption , thus restoring oxidative phosphorylation . A functional consequence of these alterations has been observed both , in vitro and in vivo as ENO - 1 depleted cancer cells exhibited decreased growth , survival and clonogenic ability ( Capello et al . , 2016 ) . Thus , this study highlighs the key role of ENO - 1 in the regulation of the Warburg eﬀect in cancer cells . Besides the role of ENO - 1 in metabolic shift of cancer cells , ENO - 1 may also regulate metabolic processes in other cell types , including pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells ( PASMCs ) ( Dai et al . , 2018 ) . Dai et al . ( 2018 ) , showed that silencing of ENO - 1 inhibited hypoxia - induced glycolysis and restored basal respiration and oxygen consumption rate accompanied by increased β - oxidation and glutamine consumption in PASMC . In addition , loss of ENO - 1 reduced PASMC proliferation and de - diﬀerentiation and induced cell apoptosis in a AMPK - Akt - dependent manner . Consequently , blockage of ENO - 1 reversed hypoxia and / or Sugen 5416 - induced pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) in rats . Importantly , these eﬀects of ENO - 1 were independent of its catalytic activity as phosphoenolpyruvate , the product of the reaction catalyzed by ENO - 1 , failed to reverse eﬀects of ENO - 1 depletion ( Dai et al . , 2018 ) . Furthermore , ENO - 1 inhibition turned out to be also beneﬁcial in type 2 diabetes . Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance . Moreover , it is associated with the obesity and the development of secondary comorbidities , such as liver , kidney , and heart disorders . Interestingly , in an experimental murine model of type 2 diabetes mellitus , inhibition of ENO - 1 by the ENOblock reduced blood glucose concentration and LDL cholesterol levels as well as decreased secondary diabetic complications such as adipocyte size , cardiac hypertrophy , expression of inﬂammatory mediators and attenuated liver ﬁbrosis ( Jung et al . , 2013 ; Cho et al . , 2017 ) . The ENOblock is a non - substrate cell permeable ENO - 1 inhibitor that was originally discovered in a small molecule screening in cancer cell cytotoxicity assays ( Jung et al . , 2013 ) . These assays help to detect agents that prefentially kill hypoxic cancer cells , thus the cells , which are mainly responsible for the resistance to anti - cancer therapies . Accordingly , ENOblock succesfully decreased migration and invasion of human colon carcinoma cells and inhibited cancer cell dissemination in a zebraﬁsh tumor xenograft model . In addition , ENOblock was found to potentiate the action of the anti - cancer drugs such as taxol and vincristine ( Jung et al . , 2013 ) . Cytoplasmic ENO was found to function as a stress - related or as a heat - shock protein . This property of ENO has been described in bacteria , yeasts , parasites , and mammalian cells . For instance , ENO was identiﬁed as one of the proteins being overexpressed under acidic conditions in Streptococcus mutants ( S . mutants ) , suggesting that ENO may participate in the survival and proliferation of S . mutans in low pH ( Wilkins et al . , 2002 ) . In Escherichia coli ( E . coli ) , ENO was found to be a major target of stress - inducing oxidative agents ( Tamarit et al . , 1998 ) , whereas in yeasts , ENO - 2 was resported to function as a heat shock protein induced by elevated temperature ( Iida and Yahara , 1985 ) . Parasites seem to utilize a similar mechanisms in order to overcome stress conditions . Namely , in Plasmodium falciparum ( P . falciparum ) , ENO was found to bind to endoprotease ( DegP ) , an enzyme , which plays important role in thermal and oxidative resistance ( Sharma et al . , 2014 ) . Lastly , ﬁndings in cardiomyocytes resemble those obtained in bacteria , yeasts , and parasites . Speciﬁcally , the interaction of ENO - 1 with heat shock protein 70 was shown to protect cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress ( Luo et al . , 2011 ) . These results indicate that the stress - related function of ENO is conserved among diﬀerent species . Besides , ENO - 1 was reported to regulate the dynamics Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 2 April 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 61 fcell - 07 - 00061 April 25 , 2019 Time : 16 : 39 # 3 Didiasova et al . Compartmentalization of Enolase - 1 of the cytoskeletal ﬁlaments . In particular , it has been shown that ENO - 1 may interact with tubulin and microtubules during myogenesis ( Keller et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , ENO - 1 can be “activated” upon stress conditions and interact with contractile ﬁlaments in cardiomyocytes thus inducing their contraction in a extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) 1 / 2 - dependent manner ( Mizukami et al . , 2004 ) . Finally , ENO - 1 has been detected in the centrosome of HeLa cells during the cell cycle . Although not experimentally proven , it is conceivable , that centrosomal ENO - 1 may regulate the interphase cytoskeleton and the mitotic spindle organization ( Johnstone et al . , 1992 ) . Altogether , these ﬁndings indicate that , cytosolic ENO - 1 irrespective of its catalytic function , contributes to the diverse physiological and pathological conditions ( Figure 1 ) . Nuclear Activities of ENO By using an alternative start codon , ENO - 1 gene can give rise to a truncated 37 kDa protein , also called myc promoter - binding protein 1 ( MBP - 1 ) , which is primary localized in the nucleus . MBP - 1 lack’s the ﬁrst 96 amino acids present in ENO - 1 ( Subramanian and Miller , 2000 ) and its primary function is to bind and suppresses the activity of c - myc transcription factor . In detail , MBP - 1 recognizes TATA motif in the minor groove of c - myc P2 promoter and negatively regulates its activity by preventing the formation of a transcription initiation complex ( Feo et al . , 2000 ; Subramanian and Miller , 2000 ) . The c - myc proto - oncogene is the master regulator of cell proliferation , diﬀerentiation and apoptosis ( Dang , 2013 ) . Although , both MBP - 1 and ENO - 1 may bind to c - myc ( Feo et al . , 2000 ) , only MBP - 1 represses activity of this transcription factor and thus acts as a tumor suppressor . Consequently , MBP - 1 expression has been correlated with the clinicopathological features of diverse cancer types FIGURE 1 | Cytosolic and cytoskeletal functions of ENO - 1 . Cytosolic ENO - 1 is the main enzyme contributing to the glycolysis and its tumor adaptation Warburg effect . In addition , cytoplasmic ENO may function as a chaperone in bacteria and mammalian cells ( eukaryotic ENO - 1 is presented as a dimer , whereas bacterial ENO is an octamer ) . Furthermore , ENO - 1 can interact with ( i ) microtubules during the process of myogenesis ( ii ) contractile ﬁlaments of cardiomyocytes upon their contraction and ( iii ) centrosome during the cell cycle . including breast , prostate , and gastric cancer . In vivo studies demonstrated that , ectopic overexpression of MBP - 1 inhibits proliferation , migration , and invasion of cancer cells ( Ray et al . , 1995 ; Ghosh et al . , 2005a , b ; Hsu et al . , 2009 ; Kanda et al . , 2009 ) . For instance , Hsu et al . ( 2009 ) reported , that MBP - 1 suppresses epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) by inhibiting COX - 2 expression in gastric cancer . In addition , reduction of cyclin D1 and myocyte - speciﬁc enhancer factor 2C ( MEF2C ) transcriptional activity in prostate cancer cells was noted ( Ghosh et al . , 2005a ) . Tumor suppressor activities of MBP - 1 have been also observed in diﬀerent types of human breast carcinomas ( Lo Presti et al . , 2010 ) . While the majority of breast carcinomas displayed increased ENO - 1 levels , the levels of MBP - 1 were reduced with a concomitant increased in the activity of c - myc . Loss of MBP - 1 expression predicted local recurrence of breast cancer , while its expression correlated with a 92 % local recurrence - free survival . No correlation between nuclear MBP - 1 expression and cytoplasmic ENO - 1 levels was described , suggesting that the expression of MBP - 1 is regulated independently from ENO - 1 ( Lo Presti et al . , 2010 ) . Although the mechanisms regulating MBP - 1 / ENO - 1 ratio are not fully understood , several factors such as hypoxia , ER stress and glucose concentrations were described to inﬂuence MBP - 1 and ENO - 1 transcription . It is well - recognized that sustained hypoxia in growing tumors can enhance the invasiveness of cancer cells by regulating c - myc expression ( Huang , 2008 ) . Although ENO - 1 gene gives rise to both , ENO - 1 and MBP - 1 , ENO - 1 seems to be preferentially translated upon hypoxia ( Sedoris et al . , 2010 ) , whereas MBP - 1 in response to ER stress ( Sedoris et al . , 2010 ; Maranto et al . , 2015 ) . Moreover , alterations in the glucose concentration may inﬂuence the MBP - 1 / ENO - 1 ratio . Breast cancer cells grown at a physiological or a high concentration of glucose demonstrate increased proliferation with a corresponding decrease in the MBP - 1 levels ( Sedoris et al . , 2007 ) . In contrast , the cells grown at a low concentration of glucose display elevated amounts of MBP - 1 . In addition to the translational regulation of MBP - 1 , its interactions with diﬀerent protein partners may inﬂuence its association with the c - myc promoter . For example , the binding of the Kelch protein NS1 - BP to MBP - 1 was reported to enhance MBP - 1 - mediated repression of c - myc in vitro and in vivo ( Perconti et al . , 2007 ) . Also , Notch 1 receptor intracellular domain ( N1IC ) was found to associate with MBP - 1 as well as with ENO - 1 . It is known , that N1IC forms a complex with a YY1 transcription factor to activate c - myc . However , binding of both ENO - 1 and MBP - 1 to N1IC , suppressed N1IC - mediated c - myc transcriptional activity leading to reduced colony - forming ability of human erythroleukemia K562 cells ( Hsu et al . , 2008 ) . Nuclear activities of ENO have been also detected in plants , in particular , in Arabidopsis thaliana . Findings by Lee et al . ( 2002 ) demonstrated , that LOS2 , a genetic locus required for cold - responsive gene transcription , encodes ENO . Los2 protein binds to the promoter of the STZ / ZAT10 gene , which contains the cold - and osmotic stress - responsive elements and possesses similarities to the MBP1 - binding sequence in the human c - myc promoter . Interestingly , Los2 also binds to the DNA probe containing the human MBP - 1 - binding site in the Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 3 April 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 61 fcell - 07 - 00061 April 25 , 2019 Time : 16 : 39 # 4 Didiasova et al . Compartmentalization of Enolase - 1 c - myc promoter , indicating that the plant ENO may function as a transcription factor ( Lee et al . , 2002 ) . To sum up , the results mentioned above demonstrate that MBP - 1 is a potent tumor - suppressor ( Figure 2 ) and thus a promising target for anti - cancer therapies . Accordingly , a recent study by Cho et al . ( 2017 ) reported that , ENOblock induces MBP - 1 nuclear localization consequently leading to the decreased expression of c - myc . This resulted in a decreased migration and invasion of human colon carcinoma cells and ﬁnally their death ( Jung et al . , 2013 ) . Future clinical studies will clarify whether this inhibitor may have beneﬁcial eﬀects in cancer or diabetes patients . Association of ENO With Mitochondria Association of ENO with mitochondria was ﬁrst described in Arabidopsis thaliana cells ( Giege et al . , 2003 ) . Few years later , Entelis et al . ( 2006 ) observed a similar eﬀect in yeasts . Namely , ENO - 2 and to a lesser extent ENO - 1 were found to be tightly bound to the mitochondrial membrane and possessed RNA binding activity ( Brandina et al . , 2006 ; Entelis et al . , 2006 ) thus facilitating the import of cytosolic tRNA into mitochondria . As mitochondrial DNA carries information for a small number of macromolecules , there is a constant need for a supply of proteins and RNAs from nucleo - cytoplasmic compartment . In yeasts , two nuclear DNA - encoded tRNAs are targeted to mitochondria : tRK1 ( tRNA LysCUU ) ( Martin et al . , 1979 ) and tRNA Gln ( Rinehart et al . , 2005 ) . The transport of tRK1 is highly speciﬁc and requires interaction with the precursor of mitochondrial lysyl - tRNA synthetase ( preMsk1p ) ( Tarassov et al . , 1995a , b ) . However , the interaction of tRK1 with preMsk1p FIGURE 2 | ENO - 1 activities in the nucleus and mitochondria . Mitochondria bound ENO - 1 acts as a RNA chaperone by binding to and transporting nucleo - cytoplasmic tRNAs to the mitochondria . Furthermore , by binding to the VDAC1 ( an integral mitochondrial membrane protein ) , ENO - 1 participates in the stabilization of the mitochondrial membrane potential . By using an alternative start codon , ENO - 1 gene can give rise to truncated 37 kDa protein – myc promoter - binding protein 1 ( MBP - 1 ) , which suppresses the activity of c - myc transcription factor and thereby regulates proliferation and invasion of cancer cells . ENO in plants is encoded by LOS2 , which binds to the promoter of the STZ / ZAT10 gene , that possesses the cold - and osmotic stress - responsive elements . is not suﬃcient for the transport of tRK1 to mitochondria . Unexpectedly , ENO - 2 and ENO - 1 have been identiﬁed to bind tRK1 , enhance tRK1 - preMsk1p complex formation and to mediate tRK1 transport to this organelle ( Figure 2 ) ( Brandina et al . , 2006 ; Entelis et al . , 2006 ) . While the yeast ENO - 2 preferentially binds to tRK1 , in humans all ENO isoforms may interact with tRK1 and facilitate its transport to mitochondria ( Baleva et al . , 2015 ) . Interestingly , other glycolytic enzymes , including 3 - phospho - glycerate kinase , hexokinase , pyruvate kinase , and glyceraldehyde - 3 phosphate dehydrogenase have been found to associate with the mitochondrial membrane too ( Brandina et al . , 2006 ) . Although the binding of other glycolytic enzymes to mitochondria was found to be relatively weak , it was suggested that they enable direct transport of pyruvate to this organelle . The functional importance of the above mentioned process has been highlighted during cardiac ischemia and hyperthrophy . Binding of ENO - 1 to mitochondria was reported to dramatically decline in cardiomyocytes isolated from the hearts of doxorubicin ( Dox ) - treated rats ( Gao et al . , 2014 ) . Doxorubicin is used in the treatment of the breast cancer , however its clinical use is limited as it causes severe side eﬀects like mitochondrial damage in cardiomyocytes and subsequent apoptosis of these cells ( Carvalho et al . , 2009 ) . Mechanistically , mitochondria isolated from ENO - 1 depleted cells display a higher sensitivity to Ca 2 + - induced membrane depolarization and permeabilization and thereby a severe mitochondria dysfunction . This eﬀect can be restored by the addition of the recombinant ENO - 1 to the isolated mitochondria , which prevents mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and subsequent organelle fragmentation ( Gao et al . , 2014 ) . These ﬁndings suggest that ENO - 1 exerts a protective eﬀect on cardiomyocytes during myocardial injury by stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential . Accordingly , further studies revealed that ENO - 1 interacts with VDAC1 ( Figure 2 ) , an integral membrane protein , which is a critical regulator of mitochondrial membrane stability ( Gao et al . , 2014 ) . Although binding of ENO - 1 to mitochondria seems to prevent Ca 2 + - induced mitochondrial dysfunction in an isolated system , the concomitant increase of ENO - 1 in the cytosol of cardiomyocytes observed upon Dox - treatment of rats was found to be rather harmful . Gao et al . ( 2015 ) , demonstrated that silencing of ENO - 1 in the hearts of rats prevents Dox - induced heart injury and cardiomyocyte apoptosis . This eﬀect was also conﬁrmed in cultured cardiomyocytes and was independent of ENO - 1’s catalytic activity . Thus the relationship between ENO - 1 and mitochondria in Dox - induced cardiotoxicity is more complex . At one site , association of ENO - 1 with mitochondria is protective since it prevents organelle permeabilization in the isolated system . On the other hand , the concomitant increase of the cytosolic ENO - 1 after Dox treatment observed in vivo is harmful and potentiates Dox - induced heart injury . These contrary results highlight compartment - speciﬁc functions of ENO - 1 . ENO in Intracellular Vesicles Vacuoles present in parasites , yeast and plants are functional equivalents of the mammalian lysosomes . Transport of diﬀerent Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 4 April 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 61 fcell - 07 - 00061 April 25 , 2019 Time : 16 : 39 # 5 Didiasova et al . Compartmentalization of Enolase - 1 molecules between cytosol and vacuole is crucial for many physiological processes including , ion homeostasis , storage of various molecules , detoxiﬁcation , proteolysis of cytosolic and membrane proteins ( Rotin et al . , 2000 ) and turnover of organelles ( Kim et al . , 2007 ) . Intriguingly , ENO has been recognized as a constituent and as a regulator of vacuoles . For example , in P . falciparum , ENO was found to associate with a food vacuole ( Bhowmick et al . , 2009 ) . Another study identiﬁed three diﬀerent variants of ENO present in this organelle ; the typical 50 kDa form and the 65 and 75 kDa forms , the latters were shown to be ubiquitinated . While the low molecular weight forms were reported to assist in the fusion of the food vacuoles , the 75 kDa form of ENO was described to interact with hemozoin , a disposal product formed by the digestion of hemoglobin in blood - feeding parasites ( Figure 3 ) . Breakdown of hemoglobin leads to the release of high quantities of free heme , which is toxic to parasites . However , parasites may convert free heme to the non - toxic hemozoin and store it in vacuoles . Neutralization of the toxic heme by parasite speciﬁc enzymes is one of the mechanism by which parasites escape host immunity and survive in a hostile environment . Thus , it was suggested that diﬀerent variants of ENO present in vacuoles may have distinct functional activities ( Shevade et al . , 2013 ) . Experiments performed in yeasts described similar eﬀects . Proteome proﬁling of the yeast vacuolar membrane identiﬁed ENO - 2 to be enriched in this compartment , implying a possible transporter or fusion - related function ( Wiederhold et al . , 2009 ) . Indeed , a study by Decker and colleagues revealed , that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , ENO - 1 and ENO - 2 stimulate fusion of vacuoles independently from their catalytic functions ( Figure 3 ) . Consequently , deletion of either ENO - 1 or ENO - 2 caused vacuole fragmentation . Furthermore , ENO - 1 or ENO - 2 deﬁciency prevented normal protein sorting to vacuoles , thus exacerbating the fusion defect ( Decker and Wickner , 2006 ) . Finally , the association of ENO with vacuoles has been also observed in plants . Barkla et al . ( 2009 ) demonstrated that ENO together with aldolase associate with subunits of the vacuolar H + - ATPase and V - ATPase and stimulate V - ATPase activity in vitro by increasing the aﬃnity for ATP ( Figure 3 ) . Consistently , a single point mutation in the 5 (cid:48) region of the ENO gene ( los2 mutation ) , displayed increased sensitivity to salt and an impaired ability to regulate V - ATPase hydrolytic activity in response to aldolase . Furthermore , it was suggested that , ENO not only channels ATP to the V - ATPase , but also directly enhances H + - pump’s activity ( Barkla et al . , 2009 ) . Whether ENO - 1 associates with lysosomes in mammalian cells requires further investigations . ENO Activities on the Membrane and in Extracellular Space Next unanticipated location of ENO - 1 is cell surface and extracellular space , where ENO - 1 either associates with exosomes or is secreted as a soluble protein . Cell surface bound ENO - 1 has been detected on several cell types including immune ( Miles et al . , 1991 ; Redlitz et al . , 1995 ; Wygrecka et al . , 2009 ) , cancer ( Didiasova et al . , 2014 , 2015 ) and neuronal cells ( Haque et al . , 2018 ) as well as bacteria ( Pancholi and Fischetti , 1998 ; Derbise et al . , 2004 ) . Outside of the cell , ENO - 1 acts as a plasminogen binding receptor ( PLG - R ) ( Figure 4 ) ( Plow and Das , 2009 ) . Plasminogen ( PLG ) is a zymogen , which is converted to the serine FIGURE 3 | Vacuole - related functions of ENO . Vacuole - associated ENO in parasites exists in three different variants : the low ( 50 and 65 kDa ) and high ( 75 kDa ) molecular weight forms . While the low molecular weight ENO variants regulate fusion of food vacuoles , the 75 kDa form interacts with hemozoin , a disposal product of hemoglobin digestion . Binding of ENO to hemozoin plays a role in parasites survival . In plants , ENO binds to subunits of the vacuolar H + - ATPase and V - ATPase and stimulates V - ATPase activity in an aldolase ( ALD ) - dependent manner by increasing the afﬁnity for ATP . This mechanism is used by plants to overcome high salt concentrations .

Compartmentalization of Enolase - 1 FIGURE 4 | The role of membrane bound and extracellular ENO . In addition to the intracellular activities , ENO - 1 may be translocated to the cell surface or released into the extracellular environment as a free soluble protein or bound to exosomes . Surface bound ENO - 1 acts as a plasminogen ( PLG ) binding receptor and participates in plasmin ( PLA ) formation , which degrades extracellular matrix proteins ( ECM ) . Furthermore , cell surface ENO - 1 can bind extracellular RNA ( eRNA ) , which may act as a bridging molecule between bacterial ENO and eukaryotic ENO - 1 and thus facilitate bacterial dissemination . In addition , ENO is a part of the bacterial degradosome , which consists of RNase E , RNA helicase 1B ( HEL1B ) and polynucleotide phosphorylase ( PNPase ) . ENO binding to the degradosome affects the activity of the complex and consequently cellular RNA processing . Lastly , ENO - 1 secreted outside of the cell either in the form of exosomes or as a free ﬂoating protein may induce migration and a pro - inﬂammatory phenotype of immune cells . protease plasmin ( PLA ) in the presence of the physiological activators : urokinase - type PLG activator ( uPA ) or tissue - type PLG activator ( tPA ) ( Didiasova et al . , 2014 ) . Consequently , PLA activates collagenases , degrades ﬁbrin and several other matrix proteins . ENO - 1 - dependent PLA formation allows pathogens ( Chhatwal , 2002 ) as well as immune ( Wygrecka et al . , 2009 ) and cancer cells ( Hsiao et al . , 2013 ) to invade tissue , consequently leading to infection , inﬂammation , and metastasis formation . We previously demonstrated that pericellular proteolysis mediated by ENO - 1 plays a crucial role during the recruitment of monocytes to the inﬂamed lung . Overexpression studies revealed that ENO - 1 potentiated migration and matrix - penetrating capacity of monocytes in a PLA - dependent manner while monocytes bearing truncated ENO - 1 variant missing PLG - binding site failed to inﬁltrate the lung ( Wygrecka et al . , 2009 ) . Similar eﬀects have been observed in the kidney stone disease , where cell surface bound ENO - 1 enhanced migration and invasion of monocytes through renal interstitium ( Chiangjong and Thongboonkerd , 2016 ) . On the cell surface of cancer cells , ENO - 1 was reported to regulate migration , invasion and colony formation ( Mikuriya et al . , 2007 ; Cappello et al . , 2009 ; Hsiao et al . , 2013 ; Didiasova et al . , 2015 ; Principe et al . , 2015 ) . In lung cancer , knock down of ENO - 1 decreased the pericellular ﬁbrinolytic activity of cancer cells and thereby their invasion . Consequently , adoptive transfer of an anti - ENO - 1 antibody inhibited the formation of tumor metastasis in the lung and the bones ( Hsiao et al . , 2013 ) . In breast cancer , increased levels of cell surface ENO - 1 correlated with enhanced migration and invasion of cancer cells and these eﬀects where abrogated by a speciﬁc peptide blocking PLG binding to ENO - 1 ( Didiasova et al . , 2015 ) . The presence of ENO on the surface of bacteria has been shown to facilitate their migration and tissue invasion leading to the eﬃcient dissemination of bacteria ( Figure 3 ) . This mechanism was found to be used by many bacteria including , S . pneumoniae ( Bergmann et al . , 2001 , 2013 ) , Borrelia spp . ( Floden et al . , 2011 ) , Aeromonas hydrophila ( Sha et al . , 2009 ) , Neisseria spp . ( Knaust et al . , 2007 ) , Mycoplasma spp . ( Bao et al . , 2014 ) and by pathogenic fungi such as Paracoccidioides brasiliensis ( Nogueira et al . , 2010 ) , Aspergillus fumigatus ( Funk et al . , 2016 ) , Candida albicans ( Funk et al . , 2016 ) , Pneumocystis carinii ( Fox and Smulian , 2001 ) as well as parasites , such as Leishmania spp . ( Vanegas et al . , 2007 ) , Trypanosoma spp . ( Almeida et al . , 2004 ) , and Plasmodium spp . ( Pal - Bhowmick et al . , 2007a , b ; Dutta et al . , 2015 , 2018 ) . Interestingly , we reported that ENO localized on bacterial surface has an additional function to its PLG binding ability . Namely , ENO present on S . pneumoniae binds extracellular RNA ( eRNA ) . Extracellular RNA is released from injured cells during infection , it associates on the one hand with ENO present on bacteria and on the other hand Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 6 April 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 61 fcell - 07 - 00061 April 25 , 2019 Time : 16 : 39 # 7 Didiasova et al . Compartmentalization of Enolase - 1 with ENO - 1 localized on eukaryotic cells thereby facilitating infection of lung epithelial cells . Pretreatment of lung epithelial cells with RNase1 decreases not only the number of adherent bacteria but also the infection of host cells ( Zakrzewicz et al . , 2016 ) . Taken together our results indicate that upon bacterial infection , eRNA serves as a “bridging molecule” between bacterial ENO and eukaryotic ENO - 1 and thereby facilitates pathogen dissemination ( Figure 4 ) . Intriguingly , the membrane - associated ENO in bacteria displays another moonlighting function . Namely , it is involved in the processing of rRNA and degradation of mRNA , and comprises a part of a larger complex termed degradosome . Degradosome is tightly anchored to the inner cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and is additionally composed of RNA helicase 1B , RNase E , and polynucleotide phosphorylase ( PNPase ) ( Liou et al . , 2001 ) . Disruption of the ENO binding to degradosome induces hypoactivity of the complex , which in turn leads to the reduced turnover of cellular RNA ( Leroy et al . , 2002 ) . In addition , the degradosome - bound ENO was described to play a role in the regulation of the ptsG mRNA stability in E . coli . PtsG mRNA encodes the major glucose transporter and is rapidly degraded upon accumulation of glucose - 6 - P and fructose - 6 - P in bacteria . Interestingly , deletion of ENO can restore reduced levels of ptsG mRNA , by prolonging ptsG mRNA stability . These results indicate that ENO - mediated regulation of ptsG mRNA stability may coordinate bacterial response to a metabolic stress ( Morita et al . , 2004 ) . Despite a large number of studies demonstrating the active role of cell surface bound ENO - 1 in invasion of immune , cancer cells and bacteria , the molecular mechanism driving ENO - 1 translocation to the cell surface remains unclear . The lack of a signal peptide within the ENO - 1 sequence suggests that this protein uses a non - classical secretory pathway to exteriorize . Furthermore , the transport of ENO - 1 to the extracellular space was found to be regulated by a plethora of factors . It has been shown that inﬂammatory stimuli , growth factors , and cell death alter ENO - 1 cell surface abundance , thereby increasing the complexity of compartment - speciﬁc functions of ENO - 1 . Broad range of inﬂammatory stimuli has been shown to regulate cell surface expression of ENO - 1 . For instance , LPS potentiated ENO - 1 exteriorization in monocytes ( Wygrecka et al . , 2009 ) and in cancer cells ( Didiasova et al . , 2015 ; Perconti et al . , 2017 ) . Stimulation of macrophages with IFN - γ in combination with vitamin D3 ( Das et al . , 2007 ) as well as the treatment of cancer cells with CCL - 2 or TNF - α ( Didiasova et al . , 2015 ) enhanced ENO - 1 transport to the cell surface . Dead cells displayed higher PLG binding capacity in comparison to viable cells and this eﬀect was a consequence of enhanced cell surface exposure of diﬀerent PLG receptors , including ENO - 1 ( O’Mullane and Baker , 1999 ; Ucker et al . , 2012 ) . Finally , growth factors , like TGF - β 1 ( Didiasova et al . , 2015 ) and EGF ( Perconti et al . , 2017 ) enhanced extracellular transport of ENO - 1 in cancer cells . Though many stimuli have the ability to potentiate cell surface expression of ENO - 1 , little is known about the mechanisms and intracellular factors that are crucial for the translocation of this glycolytic enzyme from intra - to extracellular space . For example , it was demonstrated that ﬂuctuations in the intracellular levels of calcium , post - translational modiﬁcations ( PTMs ) and interactions with other proteins are crucial for LPS - triggered ENO - 1 translocation to the extracellular space . In particular , we showed that the calcium inﬂux is a driving force for ENO - 1 transport to the cell surface as well as to the extracellular milieu in the form of exosomes . The stromal interaction molecule ( STIM ) 1 and the calcium release - activated calcium modulator ( ORAI ) 1 - mediated store - operated calcium FIGURE 5 | Compartment - speciﬁc activities of ENO protein . The presence of ENO in different cellular compartments and its contribution to the physiological as well pathological processes . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 7 April 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 61 fcell - 07 - 00061 April 25 , 2019 Time : 16 : 39 # 8 Didiasova et al . Compartmentalization of Enolase - 1 entry were found to be crucial for this process ( Didiasova et al . , 2015 ) . In addition , we observed that exposure of cancer cells to LPS triggers protein arginine methyltransferase 5 ( PRMT5 ) - mediated monomethylation of arginine 50 in ENO - 1 ( Zakrzewicz et al . , 2018 ) and thus enhances cell surface expression of this protein . Interestingly , several other ENO - 1 PTMs , such as ubiqitination , acetylation and phosphorylation were reported too ( Pal - Bhowmick et al . , 2007b ; Foth et al . , 2008 ; Shevade et al . , 2013 ) and ENO - 1 ubiquitination was found to direct ENO - 1 to vacuoles . In addition , we explored that ENO - 1 interaction with caveolin - 1 and annexin - 2 promotes ENO - 1 translocation to specialized subset of lipid rafts called caveolae and thus its transport to the extracellular space ( Zakrzewicz et al . , 2014 ) . Although it is not clear how these single mechanisms coordinate the process of ENO - 1 exteriorization , it is tempting to speculate that the initial increase of intracellular calcium induced by LPS triggers ENO - 1 methylation , which works as a sorting signal and marks ENO - 1 designated to the cell membrane . Consequently , binding of ENO - 1 to caveolin - 1 and annexin - 2 then facilitates the translocation of this enzyme to the extracellular space . However , the precise molecular mechanism regulating these steps needs to be further investigated . As indicated above , ENO - 1 is not only translocated to the cell surface but also released into the extracellular space either in the form of exosomes ( Graner et al . , 2009 ; Henderson and Azorsa , 2012 ; Didiasova et al . , 2015 ) or as a soluble protein ( Guillou et al . , 2016 ) . Exosomes are small vesicles that play a role in the intercellular communication and may inﬂuence behavior of target cells . We found that exosomes loaded with ENO - 1 may enhance cancer cell migration and invasion ( Didiasova et al . , 2015 ) . Soluble ENO - 1 was found in serum and synovial ﬂuid of rheumatoid arthritis patients ( Guillou et al . , 2016 ) and in serum of patients suﬀering from lupus erythematosus ( Hawro et al . , 2015 ; Li et al . , 2018 ) , systemic sclerosis ( Terrier et al . , 2010 ; Mehra et al . , 2013 ) and Alzheimert’s disease ( Castegna et al . , 2002 ; Butterﬁeld and Lange , 2009 ; Owen et al . , 2009 ) . In rheumatoid arthritis , ENO - 1 was found to reattach to the cell surface of monocytes and stimulate their pro - inﬂammatory state by inducing the CD14 - dependent TLR4 signaling ( Guillou et al . , 2016 ) . Similar observations have been made in patients with a kidney stone disease . Here , it was proposed that ENO - 1 secreted from renal tubular cells may attach not only to monocytes but also to calcium oxalate crystals , the constituents of kidney stones , thus promoting tissue invasion of monocytes and attachment of calcium oxalate crystals to ECM ( Chiangjong and Thongboonkerd , 2016 ) . To sum up , not only surface - bound but also secreted ENO - 1 displays strong PLG binding capacity and thus marked impact on local extracellular proteolytic activity . Hence , targeting extracellular ENO - 1 may be beneﬁcial not only in the treatment of cancer patients , but also in infectious diseases caused by multiresistant strains and in chronic autoimmune diseases . CONCLUSION AND FINAL REMARKS The glycolytic enzyme ENO - 1 displays highly plastic nature when it comes to its activities . ENO non - glycolytic functions such as cell surface plasminogen binding , maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane stability , transcriptional repressor activity in the nucleus , as well as chaperon and vacuole fusion activity in the cytoplasm imply that the localization of this enzyme determinates its action ( Figure 5 ) . Since the mechanistic aspects underlying ENO multitasking remain not understood , future studies are needed to explore the structural and molecular requirements driving ENO shuttling and thus its diverse activities . Nevertheless , the fact that ENO - 1 handles high number of cellular processes indicates that ENO - 1 targeted therapeutic approaches should be carefully considered . To avoid adverse eﬀects related to the inhibition of the physiological activities of ENO - 1 in healthy cells , therapies targeting pathological features of ENO - 1 in diseased cells are urgently needed . Nanoparticles with cell - speciﬁc targeting may oﬀer such a possibility . A recently published study documented a signiﬁcant anti - tumor eﬀect of ENO - 1 targeted lipid nanoparticles in an animal model of prostate cancer ( Wang et al . , 2018 ) , thus opening the door for the future clinical trials not only in tumor - related pathologies , but also in other diseases , such as diabetes and cardiac hypertrophy , where ENO - 1 related abnormalities are observed as well .
