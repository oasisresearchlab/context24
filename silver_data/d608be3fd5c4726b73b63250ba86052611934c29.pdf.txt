Since androgen receptor ( AR ) plays a central role in PCa carcinogenesis and progression , it is imperative to systematically elucidate the causal association between AR and miRNAs , focusing on the molecular mechanisms by which miRNAs mediate AR signalling . In this study , we performed a series of time - course microarrays to observe the dynamic genome - wide expressions of mRNAs and miRNAs in parallel in hormone - sensitive prostate cancer LNCaP cells stimulated by androgen .

Based on theoretical identification and experimental validation , novel mechanisms addressing cell viability in PCa were unravelled for 3 miRNAs newly recognized as AR targets .

( 2 ) miR - 27a is directly up - regulated by AR , and represses ABCA1 and PDS5B . ( 3 ) miR - 133b is directly up - regulated by AR , and represses CDC2L5 , PTPRK , RB1CC1 , and CPNE3 , respectively . Moreover , we found miR - 133b is essential to PCa cell survival . Our study gives certain clues on miRNAs mediated AR signalling to cell viability by influencing critical pathways , especially by breaking through androgen’s growth restriction effect on normal prostate tissue .

Introduction MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are 20 , 24 nt endogenous protein - nonencoding RNAs , and have emerged as a major class of regulatory molecules involved in mammal embryonic develop - ment and pathogenesis [ 1 ] . Recently , an increasing number of studies have pointed out that miRNAs play strong roles in prostate cancer ( PCa ) initiation , progression and metastasis [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . Prostate is dependent on androgens for growth and development , meanwhile its normal tissue is controlled by certain growth restriction mechanisms to avert androgen - induced over - growth , it is imperative to reveal how the androgen receptor ( AR ) mediates these actions and breaks through growth restriction for guiding PCa carcinogenesis . Thus , we attempted to systematically identify miRNAs that bridge the pathways from AR stimulation to cellular phenotypic effect in PCa . Presently , several reports identified miRNAs in AR signalling in the prostate cancer [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] . miR - 21 was directly up - regulated by AR in androgen - responsive PCa cells [ 6 ] , due to AR binding on the defined promoter . J . Ribas et al . further found inhibition of miR - 21 can diminish androgen - induced PCa cell proliferation , and miR - 21 was sufficient for androgen - dependent tumours to overcome castration - induced growth arrest [ 6 ] . miR - 125b was direct stimulated by AR , and promoted androgen - independent PCa growth by repressing the expression of Bak1 which regulated apoptotic signalling in PCa [ 7 ] . J . Ribas et al . [ 6 ] performed microarray analysis for miRNA expression in two androgen - dependent PCa cell lines LNCaP and LAPC - 4 to find AR - regulated target miRNAs . However , it cannot clearly distinguish the direct and indirect targets of AR since the miRNA expression profile was obtained at 72 h after androgen stimulation . Recently , K . Takayama et al . have performed a genome - wide screening of AR target genes by integrating CAGE and ChIP - chip analysis to identify AR binding sites ( ARBSs ) in the human genome in LNCaP cells [ 4 ] . They determined genome - wide ARBSs in the 100 kb vicinity of miRNA genes . Based on the chromosome binding , K . Takayama et al . provided useful information for elucidating miRNA - mediated AR signalling network . However , under the special biological conditions , not all targets identified by ChIP - chip analysis are the real targets of AR ; among all the AR - targeted miRNAs , the critical miRNAs contributing to AR signalling , may not be found out only through chromosome - binding analysis . PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56592 On the other hand , to study how miRNA mediates AR signalling , it is necessary to identify miRNA’s target mRNAs . Seed - sequence - based predictions of miRNA target , such as TargetScanS , miRanda and miRDB databases , provide necessary informative clues ; application of these prediction database in the specific context can identify miRNA’s actual targets . In most cases for animals , although miRNAs and target mRNAs are not completely base - matched , miRNAs can still cause target mRNA degradation via exonucleases or P - body [ 8 ] . Namely , the expression change of target mRNA can mainly reflect miRNA’s regulation . Therefore , it is ideal to simultaneously observe expressions of both miRNAs and mRNAs in a time - series manner in order to efficiently identify miRNA’s regulation on target in a tissue - specific context . Recently , V . Jayaswal et al . [ 9 ] have provided a dynamic data simultaneously observing miRNA and mRNA expressions in a myeloma cell line U266 . Based on the matched miRNA - mRNA time - course data , they calculated odds statistic [ 9 ] for each miRNA - mRNA pair obtained from sequence - based prediction . Moreover , miRNA expression change may not necessarily produce an instantaneous change in target mRNA expression [ 9 ] , this time - lag effect ought to be considered when determining miRNA regulation . In V . Jayaswal et al . ’s method [ 9 ] , the significance of odds statistic was not assessed by false discovery rate which is the standard for assessing significance , and time - lags with different intervals for representing miRNA’s delayed effect were equally treated that is not in line with actual circumstance . Therefore , an improved algorithm for accurately identifying miRNA target in a specific context is basically demanded . In principle , the critical miRNAs which play strong roles in mediating AR pathways in androgen - dependent PCa cells will be significantly up - regulated after androgen stimulation , and proba - bly keep the high expressions for a relatively long time . In this study , we performed a time - series microarray to simultaneously observe genome - wide miRNA and mRNA expressions under dihydrotestosterone ( DHT , a typical androgen ) stimulation in LNCaP cells which are androgen - dependent . In order to de - termine miRNAs’ roles in AR signalling , we introduced Response Score to identify AR target miRNAs , as well as Modulation Score to identify miRNA target mRNAs . After biological experimental validation , several interesting mechanisms for miRNAs’ mediating in AR signalling are newly revealed , which significantly contribute to PCa cell survival and pathogenesis , and the study also revealed some possible mechanism for breaking through androgen’s growth restriction . Materials and Methods Cell Culture and Androgen Treatment The hormone - sensitive human prostate cancer LNCaP cell line was obtained from ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and penicillin ( 100 units / ml ) - streptomycin ( 100 g / ml ) at 37 u C in a humidified 5 % CO2 cell incubator . LNCaP cells were cultivated in Phenol Red - free RPMI 1640 ( GIBCO / BRL ) supplemented with 10 % charcoal - dextran - stripped FBS for 3 days before androgen treatment , then were induced with DHT at concentration of 10 nM . The genome - wide dynamic response to DHT was analyzed at ten time points - 0 h , 20 min , 40 min , 1 h , 2 h , 4 h , 8 h , 16 h , 24 h and 48 h , where ‘0 h’ represents the state before androgen action . In this study , the 10 time points are numerated as k = 0 , 1 , 2 , … 9 . For each time point , total RNA was extracted and purified using the RNeasy Mini kit ( Qiagen , Inc . , Valencia , CA ) . Genome - wide Expression Profile by Illumina BeadArray Total RNAs at each time point were hybridized to Illumina Sentrix Human WG - 6 _ V2 expression BeadChip arrays ( for mRNA ) and MicroRNAExpression Profiling Panels ( for miRNA ) separately . The raw microarray data were uploaded to the Gene Expression Omnibus public repository ( http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / geo / ; Gene Expression Omnibus series no . GSE21245 ) . Data Pre - processing We normalized microarray data using quantile method , and processed the unauthentic data . For a gene , ‘Detection P value’ evaluates the authenticity of detected signal data . If ‘Detection P value’ , 0 . 01 , the signal is regarded as authentic ; otherwise is unauthentic . We proposed a criterion for amendment of un - authentic data . In each microarray , the minimum value of authentic signal is set as threshold , and denoted as Min au . For an unauthentic signal data , a is the original value , and the amended value a ’ = max { a , Min au } . Genes with more than 5 unauthentic signals were excluded . Afterwards , the whole data were regarded as credible . Identification of AR Candidate Primary Targets 1 ) Androgen - responsive genes . For gene g , A g ~ ½ a 0 , a 1 , a 2 , (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) , a N (cid:2) T represents its transcript vector , where N is the number of time points excluding 0 h , and N = 9 in this study . a k ( k = 0 , 1 , 2 , … , N ) denotes transcript value at time k , and a 0 works as control for DHT stimuli . For gene at each time point , ‘Diffscore’ represents differential expression significance compared to 0 h . We regard Diffscore ƒ { 13 as downregulated , and Diffscore § 13 as upregulated , corresponding to p ƒ 0 : 05 . M ~ ½ m 1 , m 2 , (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) , m N (cid:2) T denotes a mRNA’s discretized expression vector , i . e . m k ( k = 1 , 2 , … , N ) = 1 , - 1 or 0 due to upregulation , downregulation or undifferentiation at time k ; and W ~ ½ w 1 , w 2 , (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) , w N (cid:2) T denotes a miRNA’s discretized expression vector . If a gene is significantly differentially expressed at a time point compared with 0 h , it is defined as ‘androgen - responsive gene’ in this study . 2 ) Time discriminator for early - and late - response . To systematically identify AR directly regulated targets , we develop a strategy to detect ‘time discriminator’ which mainly distinguishes early - and late - response stages . At each time point , the number of differential expressed genes ( compared to 0 h ) was counted . We draw a curve of differentially expressed miRNA gene number along time course . As the number of differentially expressed genes at a late stage are definitely much larger than that at an early stage due to the cascade amplification effect [ 10 ] , we define the time discriminator t as the time point when the second burst of differential gene number appears , i . e . from t , the differential expression is at a late stage . 3 ) Response score for measuring gene’s androgen - response . It is generally considered that the direct target of AR should have an early expression response to androgen treatment ; furthermore , genes with early and durative androgen - response are likely not only to be directly regulated by AR , but also play essential roles in AR signalling . Accordingly , in order to identify miRNAs that are both early and late responders , i . e . with early and durative androgen - response , we propose a statistic Response Score ( RS ) to measure a gene’s expression response to androgen stimuli : miRNA - Mediated AR Signalling Pathway PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56592 RS ~ X N k ~ 1 ( N z 1 { k ) D m k D { X N k ~ 2 f k I ( m k m j ~ { 1 ) , ð 1 Þ where f k ~ Int ( N ( t { 1 ) t { 2 { t { 12 ) , k v t , Int ( N { t 2 z 1 ) , k § t : ( In Eq . ( 1 ) , m k is the component of discretized expression vector of the gene , m j is the first non - zero element in the sequential set f m k { 1 , m k { 2 , (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) , m 1 g ; I ( x = y ) equals 1 if the condition is satisfied and 0 , otherwise ; Int ( x ) takes the integral part of x to be its value . The first term in Eq . ( 1 ) is the cumulative effect of androgen - response pinpointed by the weight factor N + 1 - k , i . e . the differential expression happened at an earlier time has the greater contribu - tion to the role . The second term in Eq . ( 1 ) is the punishment for frequent alteration of differential direction , since genes with oscillating direction change is less important in signal conduction . Reflected by f k , it is punished heavier for direction alteration happened at an early stage , and punished slighter for a late stage , since early response is more important for AR primary regulation . Based on the RS definition , genes with greater RS values are more inclined to be directly regulated by AR , and are more inclined to play essential roles in carrying AR’s cellular effects . In this study , the top 10 % genes sorted by RS are theoretically identified as AR candidate primary targets . Identification of Targets Significantly Modulated by miRNA 1 ) OR - statistic . To view miRNAs’ global modulation on mRNAs , we observe the expression profiles over time course , and focus on whether there is a change in expression rather than the direction of change . Let . a ~ X M i ~ 1 X si j ~ 1 I ( X N k ~ 1 D w ik D ~ 0 ) I ( X N k ~ 1 D m jk D ~ 0 ) , b ~ X M i ~ 1 X s i j ~ 1 I ( X N k ~ 1 D w i k D ~ 0 ) I ( X N k ~ 1 D m jk D w 0 ) , c ~ X M i ~ 1 X si j ~ 1 I ( X N k ~ 1 D w ik D w 0 ) I ( X N k ~ 1 D m jk D ~ 0 ) , d ~ X M i ~ 1 X si j ~ 1 I ( X N k ~ 1 D w ik D w 0 ) I ( X N k ~ 1 D m jk D w 0 ) , where M is total number of miRNAs , s i is the number of sequence - based predicted targets for miRNA i , D w ik D ~ 0 or 1 and D m jk D ~ 0 or 1 denote the expression differentiation at time k for miRNA i and mRNA j respectively . The odd ratio ( OR ) = ad / bc . If OR . 1 , miRNAs are regarded as globally modulating the expressions of predicted target mRNAs . 2 ) Modulation score for a sequence - based predicted miRNA - mRNA pair . For a predicted miRNA - mRNA pair whose members are both androgen - responsive , it is necessary to determine whether the mRNA is significantly modulated by the miRNA in the specific context . Pearson coefficient reflecting the association in a continuous manner is commonly used to measure the expression correlation of miRNA and mRNA [ 11 ] , whereas mRNA’s differential expression reflecting miRNA’s discrete modulation effect at each time point should also be considered . Additionally , a change in miRNA expression may not produce an instantaneous expression change in target mRNA , the ‘time - lag’ effect should be regarded . Therefore , we propose a statistic - Modulation Score ( MS ) - to measure miRNA regulation on sequence - based predicted target mRNA . For a predicted miRNA - mRNA pair , MS ~ E | 1 2 ln1 { r 1 z r ð 2 Þ E ~ 1 z g 1 z X N k ~ 2 ( g k z h k t k { t k { 1 ) , where g j ~ I ( m j w j ~ { 1 ) for j = 1 , 2 , … , N , and h k ~ I ( m k w k { 1 ~ { 1 ) for k = 2 , 3 , … , N . In Eq . ( 2 ) , r is Pearson correlation coefficient calculated by expression data of miRNA and mRNA , t k ( k = 1 , 2 , 3 , … , N ) represent the N time points , and t 1 ~ 13 , t 2 ~ 23 , t 3 ~ 1 , … , t 9 ~ 48 in this study . Eq . ( 2 ) seems similar to Fisher’s r - to - z transformation , which is normally distributed [ 12 ] ; howbeit Eq . ( 2 ) is advanced with weight factor E describing miRNA and mRNA’s discrete differential expression correspondence . g j measures differential expression correspondence without time delay ; whereas h k = ( t k { t k { 1 ) complements the modulation with delayed effect due to different time lags . The significance of MS is assessed by nominal p value and adjusted q value ( Supplement ) . In this study , q = 0 . 2 is set as threshold for significance identification , i . e . if q , 0 . 2 , the mRNA is identified as the direct target significantly modulated by the miRNA in the specific context . Quantitative Real - time RT - PCR for miRNA and mRNA The quantification of miRNA was performed using Bulge - LoopTM miRNA qPCR ( RiBo ) . Small nuclear RNA U6 was endogenous control . For mRNA quantification , cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using PrimerScript TM RT reagent kit ( Takara ) . The RT - PCR was performed using SYBR PremiA Ex Taq TM kit ( Takara ) on 7900HT Fast Real - Time PCR System ( Applied Biosystem ) . Primers are indicated in Table S5 of File S1 . All sample values were normalized to GAPDH . The 2 - DD Ct method was used as relative quantification measure of differential expression . Chromatin Immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) Assay ChIP assays were performed as described in ref . [ 13 ] . Briefly , cells after desired treatment were fixed with 1 % formaldehyde at 37 u C for 7 min , then the cells were harvested in SDS lysis buffer [ 50 mM Tris . Cl , pH 8 . 1 , 10 mM EDTA , 1 % SDS ] and sonicated to shear the chromatin ( 200 , 500 bp ) . For each ChIP , the soluble fraction from 2 6 10 6 cells was collected and incubated with 4 ug rabbit anti - AR antibody ( PG - 21 , Upstate ) or control normal rabbit serum ( IgG ) at 4 u C overnight . The immune complexes were captured with 20 ul of protein A / G plus - agarose beads ( Santa Cruz ) . After extensive washing , the bound DNA fragments were miRNA - Mediated AR Signalling Pathway PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 3 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56592 eluted and purified . The primers for qPCR analysis of DNA fragments containing ARE were listed in Table S3 and Table S4 of File S1 , particularly KLK3 ( PSA ) enhancer works as the positive control , whereas XBP - 1 promoter works as the negative control . Each ChIP assay was biologically repeated three times . miRNA Transfection For effective over - expression of miRNA , mimic miRNA pre - cursor molecules and negative control ( Ambion ) were transfected into LNCaP cells using Neon TM transfection system ( Invitrogen ) at concentration of 30 nM . For transfection under starvation situation , LNCaP cells were put into hormone - stripped medium for 3 days prior to transfection . Cell Proliferation / viability Assay To test miRNA’s contribution to PCa cell proliferation , LNCaP cells after transient transfection were seeded into 24 - well plate at concentration of 15 , 000 cells / well . After 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 days of transfection , 80 ul of MTT ( 5 mg / ml stock ) was added to each well and incubated for 3 h . Treated cells were lysised by DMSO and absorbance at 450 nm was measured . Each transfection at every day was repeated 3 times . Western Blotting Western blot was performed as described previously [ 14 ] using antibodies against AR ( Millipore ) , PSAP ( Santa Cruz ) and actin ( Sigma ) . For nuclear protein extraction , LNCaP cells were lysised with Buffer A ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 9 , 10 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 mMEGTA , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 5 mM PMSF ) . Nuclei were collected by centrifuge and lysised with Buffer C ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 9 , 400 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mMEGTA , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 5 mM PMSF ) . Nuclear lysate was collected by centrifuge and quantified . Luciferase Assay A reporter plasmid containing putative miRNA binding site in the 3 9 - UTR of target mRNA was cloned from the pGL3 - promoter Luciferase vector . Primers used are provided in Table S6 of File S1 . The plasmid was verified by DNA sequencing . For the luciferase assay , LNCaP cells ( 7 . 5 6 10 4 per well ) were seeded into 24 - well plates and cultured for 2 days . The cells were then cotransfected with miRNA , pGL3 - promoter Luciferase vector and pRL - TK Renilla luciferase plasmid ( Promega ) using X - treme - GENE siRNA Transfection Reagent ( Roche ) . Luciferase activity was measured at 48 h after transfection by dual luciferase reporter assay kit ( Promega ) . Results The strategy for constructing the miRNA - mediated AR signalling network in this study is illustrated in Fig . 1 . The stepwise results are presented as follows . Screening Androgen - responsive miRNAs To identify AR - targeted miRNAs by a gain - of - function approach , we performed time - course microarray to simultaneously observe miRNA and mRNA expressions in the androgen - de - pendent LNCaP cells under DHT stimulation in a time series of 0 h , 20 min , 40 min , 1 h , 2 h , 4 h , 8 h , 16 h , 24 h and 48 h , respectively . The ‘0 h’ works as the control representing cellular status before DHT stimulation . LNCaP cells were cultured in a hormone - depleted medium for 72 h before DHT stimulation . After pre - process of the original data , there were 16 , 172 mRNAs and 241 miRNAs remained . We first screened this data to find ‘androgen - responsive gene’ ( ‘ARG’ ) : if a gene has significant expression change at a time point compared to 0 h , it is termed ‘androgen - responsive’ . The differential expression compared to 0 h is measured by ‘DiffScore’ , which represents the significance of differential expression . Accordingly , 5 , 203 mRNAs and 137 miRNAs were androgen - responsive . It should be noted that , being androgen - responsive does not means being direct regulated by AR ; instead , some genes may be regulated by certain mediators in AR pathways . Our major aim is to pick out the miRNAs directly regulated by AR , which play important roles in mediating AR network by modulating target mRNAs . Among the 137 androgen - responsive miRNAs , 22 miRNAs were well documented in PCa [ 11 , 15 , 16 ] [ 17 ] . Therein , miR - 101 , miR - 145 , miR - 34a , miR - 182 , miR - 375 , miR - 181a , miR - 92b and miR - 125a are up - regulated by DHT stimulation . These miRNAs were reported as highly overexpressed in PCa [ 11 , 17 , 18 , 19 ] . miR - 16 , miR - 126 * , miR - 23b , miR - 100 , miR - 222 , miR - 133a - 1 , miR - 499 and miR - 340 are down - regulated , which are in line with previous reports [ 11 , 15 , 16 ] . The androgen - responsive mRNAs found in this study are highly consistent with previous reports . We previously established a specified database termed ARGDB database [ 20 ] , which focused on AR regulated genes by integrating literatures up to year 2009 . For the 5 , 203 androgen - responsive mRNAs found in this study , 80 % hit the androgen - responsive genes in ARGDB database . The Figure 1 . Flowchart of strategy . This is the outline of the whole procedure for analysing microarray data to construct AR network in this study . Detailed steps are provided in the methodology and result sections . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0056592 . g001 miRNA - Mediated AR Signalling Pathway PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 4 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56592 conformance implies the correctness of our experimental perfor - mance for observing genome dynamic expressions in LNCaP cell under DHT stimulation . Interesting , some genes involved in miRNA processing were upregulated by androgens ( Figure S1 in File S1 ) . For example DICER , a RNA - binding protein that processes pre - miRNA into mature miRNA , is upregulated . This is consistent with the previously reported upregulation in PCa [ 21 ] . DGCR8 , a partner of nuclear RNase III Drosha , which cleaves the stem - looped pri - miRNA into the flanking - free pre - miRNA , is also significantly upregulated . Identifying Time Discriminator for Early - and Late - response Gene expression response to androgen stimulation can happen at any time point after DHT treatment ; thus , depending only on androgen responsive cannot give more reflection on determining which responsive gene is critical . We speculate that genes with significant expression change happening at an earlier stage may play a more central role in mediating AR signalling , and may have better chance to be the direct target of AR . Therefore , in order to identify the critical miRNAs which are probably AR targets , we classified miRNA response into early and late stages in this study by determining a time discriminator t , which marks the beginning of late response . The number of differentially expressed miRNAs spanning the time course was plotted . As shown in Fig . 2A , t = 6 , corresponding to the time point 8 h is identified , which means that for miRNAs’ expression responses to androgen , [ 20 min , 8 h ) is the early stage , while [ 8 h , 48 h ] is the late stage . To assess the reliability of time discriminator t , we investigated miRNAs’ differential expression profile , and analysed ARE enrichment difference between early and late responsive miRNAs . The profile of androgen - responsive miRNAs’ differential expres - sion is observed by using log 1 : 5 ratio as a non - conservative criterion to illustrate differential expression . In Fig . 2B , the time discriminator ‘8 h’ clearly distinguishes early - and late - response stages . Accordingly , we clustered miRNAs into 4 groups : early up - regulated , late up - regulated , early down - regulated and late down - regulated ( Fig . 2B as a demonstration ) . Some androgen responsive miRNAs have differential expressions both at the early and late stages , and others only have differential expressions either at the early or late stage alone . Fig . 2C showed the distribution of early responsive 83 miRNAs ( 11 miRNAs in red solely have early response ) , late responsive 126 miRNAs ( 54 miRNAs in blue solely have late response ) , as well as 72 miRNAs are the intersection ( in purple ) . The figure is in the form of Venn diagram [ 22 ] . We then analyzed ARE enrichments for the early - and late - responsive miRNAs . It is natural to expect that genes directly regulated by AR ( e . g . the early - responsive genes ) will have higher ARE enrichment . The upstream 10 kb and the downstream 10 kb of 5 9 - start site of pre - miRNA were examined to search AR - binding sites ( ARBSs ) . Genomatix database [ 23 ] was used to detect AREs , including putative and validated androgen receptor - ( AR ) and glucocorticoid receptor - ( GR ) responsive elements , as shown in Table S1 of File S1 . Putative ARE numbers of androgen - responsive miRNAs are illustrated in Fig . 2D . It is evident that ARE enrichments for early - responsive miRNAs are significantly larger than late - responsive ones ( p , 0 . 01 , Suppl . 1 ) , which sub - stantiates the rationality of time discriminator t . Identifying Candidate miRNAs that AR Primarily Target To identify miRNAs which are probably directly regulated by AR , as well as playing a critical role in mediating AR network , we proposed and calculated a new statistic , Response Score ( RS ) for each androgen - responsive miRNA . Figure 3A shows the RS distribution of androgen - responsive miRNAs . miRNAs with RS values in the top 10 % are theoretically identified as AR primary targets . The RS threshold for miRNA is 22 , therefore 15 miRNAs ( 8 repressed and 7 induced ) were theoretically identified as candidate . To select miRNAs with novel biological importance for the following deep - going investigation , we used GenMAPP to analyze the influenced pathways for each candidate , depending on the pathway enrichment for the predicted target mRNAs which were also androgen - responsive . In this study , miRNAs’ predicted targets were provided by miRDB database [ 24 ] , whose genome - wide miRNA target prediction was performed with a newly developed bioinformatics tool , MirTarget2 [ 25 ] . MirTarget2 algorithm based on support vector machines ( SVMs ) and microarray training datasets , it showed higher selectivity at identifying downregulated genes compared with other algorithms . When performing GenMAPP , pathways with z $ 1 . 96 were regarded as significant . Among the identified candidate AR primary target miRNAs , miR - 19a , miR - 27a and miR - 133b , were found with significant pathway enrichments in critical cellular processes ( Table S2 in File S1 ) . These 3 miRNAs sustained significant up - regulation across the whole time course according to microarray data , and we validated their expression data with RT - PCR analysis . We chose the microarray sample at 40 min for miRNA RT - PCR analysis since the 3 miRNAs showed expression change as early as 40 min in the microarray experiment . The RT - PCR result was concordant with microarray data ( Fig . 3B ) . In the following , we studied the mechanisms of miR - 19a , miR - 27a and miR - 133b in mediating AR signalling to PCa carcinogenesis . Verifying AR’s Binding to miR - 19a , miR - 27a and miR - 133b Chromatin Immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assays was performed to verify AR - binding to the predicted AREs of the selected 3 miRNAs . We used the Genomatix database [ 23 ] to detect AREs in the upstream and downstream 15 kb of pre - miRNA’s 5 9 - start site . AREs with ‘Core Similarity = 1 9 were chosen for ChIP assay validation , which represent the highest match between target DNA sequence and ARE’s conserved bases . AREs detected in the upstream and downstream regions of miR - 19a , miR - 27a and miR - 133b , respectively , were illustrated in Fig . 3C . Based on ChIP assay results , we found that the treatment of 10 nM DHT in LNCaP cells for 4 h , resulted in a significant AR - binding to the chromatin of predicted AREs in miR - 19a , miR - 27a and miR - 133b , compared to the controls ( Fig . 3D ) . The qPCR analysis of KLK3 promoter ( serves as the positive control for AR - binding ) , and XBP - 1 promoter ( serves as the negative control for AR - binding ) were shown in Figure S2 in File S1 . ARE positions relative to transcription start sites ( TSS ) and primers for the validated AREs and the positive and negative DNA controls are provided in Table S3 and Table S4 of File S1 . Collectively , these data indicate that miR - 19a , miR - 27a and miR - 133b are the truly direct targets of AR in androgen - dependent PCa with up - regulated expressions . Identifying miRNA’s Direct Target mRNAs To study miRNA’s effect on regulating target mRNA expres - sion , we observed miRNAs’ genome - wide impact on regulating mRNAs as a preparative step , by calculating the OR value which focuses on whether the expression change happened or not rather than the direction of change . If OR . 1 , then miRNAs are considered as globally regulating mRNAs [ 9 ] . Our calculation ( a = 12 , 845 , b = 9 , 091 , c = 9 , 625 , d = 10 , 922 , and OR = 1 . 6 ) in this study indicates that miRNAs indeed globally affected the expressions of the predicted target mRNAs . miRNA - Mediated AR Signalling Pathway PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 5 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56592 To precisely evaluate the actual regulation of each predicted miRNA - mRNA pair , we proposed the Modulation Score ( MS ) based on regulation between miRNA and mRNA at every time point , which also considered the time - lag effect of miRNA action . For each predicted miRNA - mRNA pair whose members were both androgen - responsive , MS was calculated and the p value for each MS was assessed based on 10 6 permutations . The average value of MS is 0 . 14 for the 8 , 734 predicted androgen - responsive miRNA - mRNA pairs . The q value for each MS was also assessed ( Supplement ) . By setting q # 0 . 2 as significantly regulated , 1 , 186 predicted pairs were identified as real regulation . For the 3 miRNAs selected , 33 mRNAs are direct targets for miR - 19a , 71 mRNAs for miR - 27a and 12 mRNAs for miR - 133b . We totally selected 10 novel target mRNAs : SUZ12 , RAB13 , SC4MOL , PSAP , ABCA1 , PDS5B , CDC2L5 , PTPRK , RB1CC1 , and CPNE3 , since they are highly related with carcinogenesis . In order to confirm those mRNAs as the actual direct targets of the 3 miRNAs , we carried out RT - PCR analyses and luciferase assays . RT - PCR analyses of the 10 mRNAs were performed in LNCaP cells after miRNA transfection ( miR - 19a / miR - 27a / miR - 133b ) . Luciferase assays for validating miRNA’s direct binding to the 3 9 - UTR of mRNA were performed as following : the DNA fragment containing miRNA - binding site in the 3 9 - UTR of mRNA was cloned into the pGL3 - promoter luciferase vector ; then LNCaP cells cultured in androgen - depleted condition were cotransfected with luciferase vector and miRNA or miR - NC for 2 days , the luciferase activity change caused by miRNA was observed by comparing with NC . The RT - PCR analyses of transfected miRNA expression levels ( miR - 19a , miR - 27a , miR - 133b and miR - NC , respectively ) were presented in Figure S3 in File S1 . As results show ( Fig . 4 , Fig . 7 ) , all the 10 mRNAs were significant down - regulated after miRNA transfection in PCa cells ; more importantly , each of them was validated as the direct target of miRNA ( miR - 19a / miR - 27a / miR - 133b ) by luciferase assay . In the following , we presented miR - 19a , miR - 27a and miR - 133b’ newly identified targets , as well as their contribution to PCa malignancy . SUZ12 , RAB13 , SC4MOL , ABCA1 and PSAP are the Novel Targets of miR - 19a miR - 19a directly represses the mRNA expressions of SUZ12 , RHOB , RAB13 , SC4MOL , PSAP and ABCA1 , as illustrated by the RT - PCR analysis ( Fig . 4A ) and the luciferase assay ( Fig . 4B ) . Function sketch of these novel targets are presented below . i . Figure 2 . Time discriminator for distinguishing early and late response stages . Figure 2A .

It is as a key component in the PRC2 complex , leading to suppression of gene transcription . Several researches have revealed that PRC2 complex including SUZ12 is highly overexpressed in aggressive PCa , and represents poor prognosis [ 26 , 27 ] . In contrast to a number of SUZ12 target genes identified in hepatocellular carcinoma [ 28 ] and embryonic fibroblast [ 29 ] , little knowledge has been obtained about SUZ12 targets in PCa . We found that most SUZ12 targets in hepatocellular carcinoma and embryonic fibroblast , including EPCAM , IGFII , DKK1 , HEY2 , CCNA1 , CCND2 , DAB2IP , BMP6 , PAX4 , DLX5 , LHX1 , NEFL , NEUROG1 , NEUROG2 , NMU , SHH , showed little expression change in our PCa cell microarray data when treated by DHT ; meanwhile , BAMBI and MASS1 targeted by SUZ12 are down - regulated . This indicates that PCa has its special fingerprint of SUZ12 targets , which need further careful identification . In our study , SUZ12 was significantly down - regulated after DHT stimulation , and identified as a novel target of miR - 19a , it is possible that PCa’s epigenetic maintenance may be partly influenced by miR - 19a through down - regulating SUZ12 , and then to release SUZ12 target gene expressions which possibly contribute to PCa aggression and poor prognosis . ii . RAB13 ( MS = 1 . 10 ) encodes a GTPase that positively regulates the assembly of functional cell - cell epithelial tight junctions [ 30 ] . Currently , there is little report about RAB13’s relation with PCa . Tumor cell invasion is initiated by epithelial cell scattering , and involves cell junction disassembly , followed by cell - cell dissociation and acquisition of migratory phenotype . We suppose that miR - 19a might be involved in the initiation of PCa invasion by suppressing RAB13 . iii . SC4MOL ( MS = 4 . 92 ) encodes a sterol - C4 - methyl oxidase ( SMO ) , which catalyzes demethylation of C4 - methylster - ols in the cholesterol synthesis pathway . C4 - Methylsterols are meiosis - activating sterols ( MASs ) , and belong to pre - cholesterol sterols ; they exist at high concentrations in the testis and ovary and play roles in meiosis activation . A recent study has found SC4MOL gene mutation cause psoriasiform dermatitis [ 31 ] , by causing an accumulation of MASs in the patient , resulting in skin cell over proliferation [ 31 ] . Based on this clinical observation , by analogy we speculate that repressing SC4MOL expression might be one of the tactics for miR - 19a to enhance PCa proliferation via MAS accumulation . iv . ABCA1 ( MS = 1 . 09 ) encodes an ATP - binding cassette transporter A1 to function as a cholesterol efflux pump . Several reports have recently shown that activation of Figure 3 .

In this study , androgen’s stimulation on miR - 19a , and miR - 19a’s direct repression on ABCA1 mRNA provide a possible mechanism for how androgen represses ABCA1 to release PCa cell proliferation . vi . PSAP ( MS = 2 . 37 ) encodes the prosaposin as a highly conserved glycoprotein which is a precursor for 4 cleavage products : saposins A , B , C , and D . This precursor protein exists both as a secretory protein and as an integral membrane protein . A recent study [ 34 ] has found the prosaposin acts as a tumor - secreted inhibitor of metastasis , which functions in a paracrine and endocrine fashion by stimulating thrombospondin - 1 ( Tsp - 1 ) ’s expression in fibroblasts of both primary tumors and distant organs , in a p53 - dependent manner . In PCa , decreased Psap expression was significantly associated with metastatic tumors [ 34 ] . However , it has also been reported that PSAP is directly up - regulated by AR in PCa cells [ 35 ] . To our knowledge , up to now , little mechanism has been identified to decipher PSAP’s decreased expression in PCa . Our finding of miR - 19a’s direct suppression on PSAP , provides one of the alternative mechanisms for PSAP’s decrease in PCa . miR - 19a Enhances Androgen - stimulated Cell Viability , but is Not Necessarily Required in Mediating AR Stimulated Cell Growth The novel identified targets of miR - 19a are highly correlated with cell growth , we then analysed the final effect of miR - 19a regarding PCa cell viability . LNCaP cells cultured in androgen - depleted medium were treated with DHT , miR - 19a , and miR - NC , respectively , or in a combinational way . The cell viability was measured by MTT assay . From the results ( Fig . 4C ) , it showed that miR - 19a alone cannot significantly promote cell viability when androgen is depleted ( & compares to ¤ ) , but it can significantly enhance androgen - stimulated cell viability ( 6 compares to m ) . To test whether miR - 19a is basically required for mediating androgen - depending cell proliferation effect , we analyzed cell viability when miR - 19a was deficient . LNCaP cells cultured in androgen - depleted medium were treated with DHT , anti - miR - 19a ( si19a ) , and anti - miR - NC ( siNC ) , respectively , or in a combi - national way . Fig . 4D showed that LNCaP cell’s viability was largely dependent on DHT treatment ( m compares to ¤ ) , and the result by inhibition of miR - 19a showed little difference from inhibition of miR - NC ( ¤ compares to & ) . Therefore , miR - 19a is sufficient but not necessarily required for mediating androgen - stimulated PCa cell viability . It is interesting to mention that PSAP can also upregulate the expression and activity of AR [ 35 ] even in the absence of Figure 4 . miR - 19a’s regulation on identified targets and prostate cancer cell viability . Figure 4A . RT - PCR analysis of miR - 19a’s identified significant targets : SUZ12 , RAB13 , SC4MOL , ABCA1 and PSAP .

MTT absorbance at each time point was presented . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0056592 . g004 miRNA - Mediated AR Signalling Pathway PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 8 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56592 androgen . Therefore , it is worthy to reconsider miR - 19a’s mediator role in AR signalling . May miR - 19a have any negative influence on AR signalling due to repressing PSAP ? Aiming to solve this anxiety , in the following we analysed miR - 19a’s effect on AR expression and activity . miR - 19a or miR - NC was transfected into the LNCaP cells for 24 h and 48 h , then the mRNA expression and protein content of AR were observed . As the results show , the RNA expressions of AR ( Fig . 5A ) and total protein contents of AR ( Fig . 5B ) were both significantly reduced in miR - 19a transfected LNCaP cells compared to NC . Therefore , miR - 19a can down - regulate AR’s expression in PCa cells both in the mRNA and protein levels . Furthermore , since the nuclear content of AR is a sign for AR activity [ 36 ] , we focused on observing AR’s nuclear content to assess miR - 19a’s affect on AR activity . After miR - 19a or miR - NC transfection into LNCaP cells for 24 h and 48 h , the nuclear protein content of AR showed little difference between miR - 19a and miR - NC ( Fig . 5C ) . And for LNCaP cells pre - transfected with miR - 19a or miR - NC , when stimulated by DHT for 48 h , AR nuclear accumulation in LNCaP cells was greatly increased by miR - 19a pre - transfection compared to miR - NC ( Fig . 5D ) . Therefore , miR - 19a has little negative influence on AR activity ; instead , it largely promotes AR activity dependent on DHT stimulation through certain unknown mechanism . We guess miR - 19a’s modest influence on PSAP might be one possible reason . Although PSAP is the actual target of miR - 19a as demonstrated by the luciferase assay ( Fig . 4B ) , miR - 19a had modest repression on PSAP mRNA expression in LNCaP cells as shown in Fig . 4A . We further observed miR - 19a’s effect on the protein level of PSAP . The Western blotting result ( Fig . 5E ) demonstrates miR - 19a also had modest but reproducible effect on suppressing PSAP in multiple biological replications . Therefore , miR - 19a majorly has a positive enhancer role in mediating AR signalling to PCa carcinogenesis . ABCA1 and PDS5B are the Novel Targets of miR - 27a ABCA1 and PDS5B were verified as the novel targets of miR - 27a , by RT - PCR analyses and luciferase assays . As shown in Fig . 6 , we found ABCA1 was directly repressed by miR - 27a with the luciferase assay validation . miR - 19a and miR - 27a may coopera - tively regulate ABCA1 , to promote PCa cell proliferation [ 32 , 33 ] . PDS5B ( MS = 5 . 73 ) encodes a protein that interacts with the conserved protein complex termed cohesion . In adult prostate gland , most epithelial cells are in a state of proliferative quiescence even under persistent androgen stimulation , and androgens regulate this growth restriction effect by increasing the expression of PDS5B to induce cell cycle arrest [ 37 ] . Therefore in this study , we found a possible mechanism for breaking androgen’s growth restriction effect on normal prostate tissue may be through miR - 27a’s repression on PDS5B , upon that the PCa’s cell cycle may go on . miR - 27a is Sufficient but Not Necessarily Required for Mediating Androgen - stimulated PCa Cell Viability We analyzed miR - 27a’s role in promoting cell viability also from the two aspects : adding or depleting miR - 27a , to observe its influence on androgen - stimulated cell viability . Similarly to miR - 19a , miR - 27a can significantly enhance androgen - stimulated cell viability , but is not necessarily required for mediating androgen stimulation to PCa cell proliferation ( Fig . 6C and Fig . 6D ) . CDC2L5 , PTPRK , RB1CC1 , and CPNE3 are the Novel Targets of miR - 133b miR - 133b directly regulated the 4 target mRNAs : CDC2L5 , PTPRK , RB1CC1 , and CPNE3 ( Fig . 7A and Fig . 7B ) . i . CDC2L5 ( MS = 2 . 16 ) encodes CDK13 , a member in the cyclin - dependent serine / threonine protein kinase family . Members of this family are well known for essential roles as master switches in cell cycle control . However , the exact function of this protein has not yet been determined , and little is reported about its role in PCa . CDC2L5 encoded CDK13 can interact with L - type cyclins to alter the splicing pattern of E1a [ 38 ] , whose normally spliced product can induce cell proliferation [ 39 ] . We speculate that miR - 133b may suppress CDC2L5 expression and inhibit the alteration of E1a splicing , thus might lead to cell proliferation . ii . PTPRK ( MS = 1 . 17 ) encodes a protein in the tyrosine phosphatase ( PTP ) family . This PTP is a receptor on cellular membrane , and can specially dephosphorylate EGFR in human keratinocyte [ 40 ] . A recent study has demonstrated that in epididymal cells , DHT can direct phosphorylate steroid receptor co - activator ( SRC ) kinase . EGFR is in the downstream of SRC that can be activated by phosphorylation [ 41 ] . Therefore , miR - 133b’s suppression on PTPRK may provide a possible molecular mechanism for EGFR’s continual activation in PCa to impel cell proliferation . iii . RB1CC1 ( MS = 1 . 85 ) encodes a transcription factor termed RB1 - inducible coiled - coil 1 , which forms a complex with p53 . RB1CC1 binds to p53 can not only guarantee p53 stability [ 42 ] , but also directly activate the RB1 promoter in order to induce the transcription of RB1 ( retinoblastoma ) . The well known tumor suppressor protein RB1 is the critical inhibitor of G1 / S - phase in cell cycle . We found after DHT stimulation , RB1 mRNA expression was persistently decreased . miR - 133b’s direct repression on RB1CC1 may provide an alternative mechanism for RB1’s decline in PCa cells after androgen treatment . iv . CPNE3 ( MS = 2 . 15 ) encodes a calcium - dependent membrane - binding protein termed copine III . Little has been revealed about its role in PCa . Copine III has been characterized as a phosphoprotein with associated kinase activity [ 43 ] . We suggest that miR - 133b represses CPNE3 in PCa cells , therefore may influence some critical cellular pathways in PCa via altering certain protein activity . miR - 133b is Basically Required for Mediating Androgen Stimulation to PCa Cell Viability In the following , we analysed miR - 133b’s role in mediating androgen stimulation to PCa cell viability . Elevated expression of miR - 133b can significantly enhance androgen - stimulated CaP tumor cell growth ( Fig . 7C ) ; and surprisingly , miR - 133b was necessarily required for cell survival and mediating androgen stimulation to LNCaP cell viability ( Fig . 7D ) . We observed that LNCaP cell’s viability is largely dependent on whether inhibiting miR - 133b or not . When miR - 133b is deficient , no matter whether DHT is injected or not , the LNCaP cells show little viability ( m compares to ¤ ) ; when miR - 133b is not depleted , the LNCaP cells maintain the property to be promoted by DHT treatment ( 6 compares to & ) . Therefore , miR - 133b is basically required for mediating androgen’s stimulation to LNCaP cell growth ( 6 compares to m ) , and even is critical for fundamental cellular survive ( & compares to m ) . Constructing Novel miRNA - mediated AR Signalling Network Based on the above results , including the newly identified AR target miRNAs and the newly identified miRNA targets , we finally constructed a novel AR - signalling network mainly mediated by miRNA - Mediated AR Signalling Pathway PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 9 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56592 miR - 19a , miR - 27a and miR - 133b . As shown in Fig . 8A , we conclude that miR - 19a , miR - 27a and miR - 133b mediate AR action through the critical pathways of epigenetic property , kinase activity , invasion , cholesterol synthesis , cell cycle and the cellular survival to promote androgen - dependent PCa malignance and progression . Discussion In this study , we performed the dynamic microarray experiment for simultaneously observing expressions of genome - wide miRNAs and mRNAs in the androgen - dependent LNCaP cells stimulated by DHT for 0 h , 20 min , 40 min , 1 h , 2 h , 4 h , 8 h , 16 h , 24 h and 48 h . We analyzed each gene’s expression response to androgen stimulation comparing to the 0 h time as control . Ideally , a vehicle control ( i . e . without DHT stimulation ) should be included for each time point , and gene’s expression response to DHT ought to be strictly carried out by comparing with the vehicle control at each time point . RT - PCR analysis confirmed some well - known androgen - responsive genes KLK2 , KLK3 and TMPRSS2’ expression change during time - course ( Figure S4 in File S1 ) . When there is no external stimulation , gene’s expression change at different time points is much smaller compared with the remarkable expression change under external DHT stimulation . Therefore , it is proper for us to simply use the 0 h as the control for measuring gene expression change under DHT simulation . Previously , J . Ribas et al . reported the miRNA microarray data at the 72 h after R1881 ( the synthetic androgen methyltrienolone ) treatment in both LNCaP cells and LAPC - 4 cells . They defined an androgen - responsive miRNA as those displaying a signal above background at least a 1 . 5 - fold androgen - induced expression change in both cell lines . This criterion is probably too strict , and may lost some useful information . Therefore , only a total of 16 miRNAs were defined as androgen - responsive in their research , in which miR - 19a was contained , but miR - 27a , miR - 133b were not included . However , we showed miR - 27a and miR - 133b as AR direct targets and mediating critical roles in AR signalling . Different PCa cell line has its own optimal androgen concentra - tion . Meanwhile , observation at 72 h might be late for finding AR directly regulated targets . Thus , the identified androgen - respon - sive miRNAs in J . Ribas et al . ’s study may contain both the direct and indirect AR targets . How to precisely identify miRNA regulated targets in a specific cellular context is still a problem currently . In this study , we provided a time - course data for simultaneously measuring miRNA and mRNA expressions after DHT stimulation , and accordingly developed a new algorithm Modulation Score ( MS ) to identify miRNA’s real modulation on sequence - based predicted targets , Figure 5 .

Figure 5A – B . miR - 19a’s influence on AR expression . miR - 19a or miR – NC was transfected into the LNCaP cells for 24 h and 48 h , then AR’s mRNA expression ( Fig . 5A ) and the protein content ( Fig . 5B ) were observed .

Verified by RT - PCR analyses and luciferase vector assays , the proposed MS algorithm shows marked capability in effectively identifying miRNA target genes , therefore could be generally applied to identify miRNA’s real target when the matched dynamic miRNA - mRNA expression data are provided . Based on the dynamic microarray data , bioinformatics algorithm and the biological experiment verification , we identified miR - 19a , miR - 27a and miR - 1333b as the primary targets of AR , and mediating AR signalling through direct regulating critical target genes which finally contribute to cell viability and invasion . It is necessary to mention that , although AR signalling in PCa has been adequately analyzed , a detailed AR signalling in PCa might be generally neglected . That is , how PCa cells break through androgen’s growth restriction effect on normal prostate tissue . In adult normal prostate gland , most epithelial cells are in a state of proliferative quiescence ( namely proliferation shutoff ) , and andro - gens carry out this effect by inducing cell cycle arrest in the G0 / G1 phase , mediated by increasing PDS5B expression [ 37 ] . We found miR - 27a may direct repress PDS5B , which might provide a potential mechanism for AR’s cell proliferation role setting off in PCa . Besides , it is currently well recognized that as early as tumor initiation , metastasis begins to take place , and invasion is an important early step in the metastatic cascade . In order to invade , cells must detach from the primary tumor mainly by destroying the cell - cell junction . We found miR - 19a’s direct repressing on RAB13 , which is another clue for the cell junction disassembly in PCa . Moreover , the epigenetic changes in PCa have been the newly emerging frontier focus in lately researches [ 44 ] . In this study , we found miR - 19a can affect PCa epigenetic maintenance by directly repressing SUZ12 , which is a key component in the PRC2 complex with a robust histone methyltransferase activity to suppress gene transcription . SUZ12’s targets in PCa have been little revealed . Most SUZ12 targets in hepatocellular carcinoma and embryonic fibroblast , showed little expression change in this dynamic data after DHT stimulation . Therefore , PCa probably has its special SUZ12 targets as fingerprint , which needs further identification . To sum up , we newly found miR - 19a , miR - 27a and miR - 133b can significantly promote AR - induced LNCaP cell viability . miR - 133b was basically required for mediating AR signalling to PCa cell viability and survival . It should be mentioned that , at the time of this manuscript being prepared , two literatures lately focused on miR - 27a and miR - 133b in PCa , respectively [ 45 , 46 ] . In C . E . Fletcher et al . ’s study , they found AR can bind to the promoter of miR - 27a , and increase miR - 27a’s expression . Our finding is consistent with the result . Moreover , C . E . Fletcher et al . found miR - 27a played its oncogenic role through direct repressing the prohibitin ( PHB ) , which was the tumour suppressor and AR corepressor . In our study , we newly found miR - 27a promoted PCa’s malignant phenotype by direct regulating ABCA1 and PDS5B , to break off androgen’s growth restriction effect in normal prostate , as well as efficiently facilitate PCa cell proliferation . In researchers J . P . Patron et al . ’s study [ 46 ] , they reported that miR - 133b can direct repress antiapoptotic genes in androgen - in - Figure 6 . miR - 27a’s regulation on identified targets and prostate cancer cell viability .

We revealed miR - 133b’s essential oncogenic role in androgen - de - pendent PCa cells . Therefore , there may be a great functional transition for miR - 133b , from promoting cell survival and proliferation in the androgen - dependent PCa cells to impairing proliferation and cellular metabolic activity in the androgen - independent PCa cells . Additionally , it is interesting to mention the expression re - lationship between intronic miRNAs and host genes . Theoretical - ly , the expressions of intronic miRNA and host gene are considered highly correlated . However , a close inspection of our data indicates that their expression may not tightly relate ( Table S7 in File S1 ) . Twenty - five ( 35 . 2 % ) pairs of intronic miRNA and host do not show correlated expression . This suggests some miRNAs’ transcription independent from their host genes . In fact , 35 % intronic miRNAs have independent upstream regulatory elements with promoter function revealed by a promoterless plasmid construction [ 47 ] . Finally , miRNA’s dominant modulation is another new character in our study . Most genes are mainly regulated by only one miRNA in a specific context . On the 3 9 - UTR of a target mRNA , there exists many possible binding sites available for multiple miRNAs , which have been traditionally viewed as exerting equal regulations on the same target . We counted the number of miRNAs which significantly modulated mRNA due to the MS calculation ( Fig . 8B ) for each target mRNA . 837 androgen - responsive mRNAs were identified as miRNA targets , 71 % were singly modulated by one miRNA , and 20 . 9 % were regulated by 2 miRNAs . Targets significantly co - regulated by more than 2 miRNAs were less than 8 % . Evidently , most targets are regulated only by a dominant miRNA in a special cellular context . In addition to the different binding intensity as a factor for this phenomenon , we propose that the ‘steric hindrance’ may also contribute to this dominant modulation effect . Since RISC complex binds to the 3 9 - UTR of target mRNA through miRNA’s seed region , the steric hindrance may prevent the nearby miRNA - mediated RISC approaching and cause the dominant effect . This newly observed miRNA’s dominant modulation effect may theoretically provide molecular support for the potential practi - cality of aiming at certain dominant miRNA as therapeutic intervention in cancer treatment . Conclusion In conclusion , we provided a genome - wide time - course data concerning miRNA and mRNA expressions in parallel for androgen - dependent PCa cells under androgen stimulation , and constructed a novel AR signalling network focused on miRNAs’ mediation roles . We revealed the molecular mechanisms of linking AR stimulation to cell survival and viability . Although the present study is limited by single cell line analyses with background mutations in LNCaP cell line and supraphysiological concentra - tion of androgen treatment , our algorithms provide ways to identify AR targets and miRNA targets . With further detailed exploration on multiple cell lines for each miRNA targets , the findings of miR - 19a , miR - 27a and miR - 133b’s novel roles in LNCaP cells would suggest useful therapeutic intervention for effectively preventing PCa development .
