Introduction Cancer cases resulting in high mortality is re ﬂ ected by tumor growth , invasion , and metastasis to distant organs [ 1 – 3 ] . Moreover , the lack of curative chemotherapeutic approaches and short median survival ( ~ 14 months ) indicate the inef ﬁ ciency of current adjuvant chemotherapy or other interventions such as radiation , against cancer cells possessing the complete malignant phenotype [ 4 – 6 ] . Currently patients with recurring cancer experience high - frequencies of residual micrometastases and relapse [ 7 ] with ~ 50 % of surgically treated patients suffering recurrent disease [ 2 , 8 – 13 ] . Statistics demonstrate that cancer accounts for 585 , 720 Americans deaths each year , corre - sponding to almost 1600 deaths per day . Even after a 20 % decline in the death rate from 1991 to 2009 there still exists an intolerable socio - economical toll for this disease [ 14 , 15 ] . Overall these data indicate the need to explore new anti - cancer treatments such as dietary / nutritional supplements which have few or no effects on normal cell growth , as a novel approach for limiting cancer growth and reoccurrence . Docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , a polyunsaturated fatty acid long approved as dietary supplement , has been shown to offer a broad range of health bene ﬁ ts . DHA has been established as a viable therapeutic for diseases including hypertension , arthritis , atherosclerosis , depression , adult - onset diabetes mellitus , myocardial infarction , thrombosis , and some cancers [ 16 – 18 ] . In relationtoour current study , DHAhas previous - ly been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and survival [ 19 , 20 ] but its involvement in cancer metastasis and associated mechanisms are not known . Therefore , we chose to explore the effect of DHA on cancer cell migration , a potent re ﬂ ector of metastasis while also evaluating non - cancerous cells which should show minimal to no detrimental effects . We chose the lung adenocarcinoma cell line , A549 , as they express the invasive metastatic phenotype , and the transformed lung epithelial cell line , MLE12 , to represent non - invasive cells . Mechanistically , actin binding protein ( ABP ) - mediated cytoskeletal remodellingatthecellularmembraneedgesfacilitatescancerprogression and metastasis by inducing the formation of invasive organelles like lamellipodia , ﬁ lopodia and invadopodia [ 21 – 25 ] . cAMP induces actin polymerization through protein kinase A mediated regulation of ABP .

Our preliminary data indicated that DHA supplementation may modulate the expression and localization of ABPs ; therefore , we investigated the effects of DHA supple - mentation on the ABPs gelsolin and vimentin . The expression and function of gelsolin and vimentin are well de ﬁ ned inthecontextofactindynamics , cancerprogression , metastasis , and apoptosis [ 26 – 29 ] . Gelsolin belongs to the actin - severing gelsolin / villin superfamily and plays a key role in actin ﬁ lament disassembly by severing larger actin ﬁ laments into smaller ones [ 30 , 31 ] . As a viral actin regulator , gelsolin is involved in the formation of cancer cell inva - sive structures in coordination with other proteins like Arp3 , cortactin , and Rho GTPases [ 30 , 32 ] . Vimentin interacts with tubulin - based micro - tubules and actin - based micro ﬁ laments to comprise the cytoskeleton and thus maintain cellular integrity [ 33 , 34 ] . Vimentin facilitates the elongation of ﬁ lamentous structures along with actin in the formation of cell protrusions which are required by cancer cells for migration [ 35 , 36 ] . These studies tested the hypothesis that the anti - metastatic proper - ties of DHA are through modulation of ABPs , speci ﬁ cally gelsolin and vimentin . Our ﬁ ndings indicate that DHA inhibits cAMP - induced cell migration in A549 cancer cells and has little to no effect on MLE12 con - trol cells . Expression of both gelsolin and vimentin were altered with cAMP treatment and DHA supplementation , but no clear patterns were observed . Collectively , these data indicate that DHA suppresses cell migration induced by cAMP in cancerous cells but the ABPs gelsolin and vimentin may not be involved directly in DHA - mediated inhibition . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Cell culture and treatment Non - invasive lung epithelial cells ( MLE12 ) and invasive lung cancer cells ( A549 ) ( American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA ) were cultured at 37 °C in a humidi ﬁ ed atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 . MLE12 cells were maintained in HITES media previously published by our laboratory [ 37 ] . A549 cells were grown in DMEM 1× with 10 % FBS supplemented with 4 . 5 g / L - glucose . Cells were treated when ~ 80 % con ﬂ uent ( for 6 h or 24 h ) with either PBS ( the vehicle control ) , cell permeant analogs of cAMP ( 8Br - cAMP , 300 μ M ) ( Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) , DHA ( 30 μ M ) , or both cAMP and DHA prior to plating ( pre - treatment ) or post plating ( post - treatment ) . 2 . 2 . Transwell analysis As a measurement of metastatic phenotype , the cell migration rate was studied using transwell apparatus . Six well plates were set - up using Falcon ' s Transparent PET Membrane , 8 . 0 μ m pore size , 1 × 10 5 pores / cm 2 inserts , according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . Cells were treated with 8Br - cAMP and / or DHA either just prior to plating ( pre - treatment ) or immediately after ( post - treatment ) to mimic the pre - and post - metastasis treatment of cancers . The cAMP analogue , 8Br - cAMP , was used to induce a proliferative state in our cells . A549 and MLE12 cells were plated at 1 × 10 5 cells per well and were incubated in a humidi ﬁ ed tissue culture incubator at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . After 24 h of growth , cells that migrated to the lower compartment were counted using a Neubauer cell counting chamber and the percentage of cells that migrated were calculated . 2 . 3 . Western blot Lysis buffer ( Nupage®LDS sample buffer ) containing PMSF ( 0 . 3 nmol / ml ) , okadoic acid ( 0 . 01 nmol / ml ) , leupeptin ( 0 . 1 nmol / ml ) and aprotonin ( 0 . 005 – 0 . 01 TIU / ml ) was used to prepare total cell lysates . Proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE , transferred to nitro - cellulose membranes , and probed with anti - human rabbit monoclo - nal antibodies targeting gelsolin ( dilution , 1 : 1000 ) ( Cell Signaling Technology , Inc . , Danvers , MA ) , anti - human mouse monoclonal antibodies targeting Vimentin ( dilution , 1 : 1000 ) ( Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) , and mouse monoclonal antibodies targeting β - actin ( 1 : 10 , 000 ) ( Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) . Finally , membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody ( dilution , 1 : 1000 ) ( BD Pharminogen® , Franklin lakes , NJ ) for 1 h at room tempera - ture and speci ﬁ c bands were visualized employing Amersham ™ ECL ™ Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent ( GE Healthcare , Buckingham - shire , UK ) . The band intensity was measured by densitometry . 2 . 4 . Immuno ﬂ uorescence ( IF ) microscopy Cells were plated in 6 - well plates containing cover slips ( Corning Incorporated Corning , New York , NY ) at 1 × 10 5 cells / well and treated with 8Br - cAMP and / or DHA as previously described . A wound was induced across the cell monolayer , and incubated for an additional 24 h . The cover slips were then removed and the cells were stained withanti - gelsolin ( 1 : 500 ) oranti - vimentin ( 1 : 500 ) followedbythesec - ondary antibody , Alexa 488 labeled IgG ( 1 : 1000 ) . Nuclei were stained with DAPI ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Images were acquired by confocal microscopy ( LSM510 , Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) in a blinded fashion using identical settings for all images ( 200× ) . Percent change in protein intensity was quanti ﬁ ed using NIH Image J analysis . Human control ( n = 4 ) and malignant ( n = 4 ) lung tissue slides were obtained from Lung Cancer Biospecimen Research Network ( LCBRN ) ( University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA ) . Tissues were proc - essed for immuno ﬂ uorescence labelling using standard protocols [ 38 ] . Tissue sections were stained with primary anti - human rabbit monoclo - nal antibodies for gelsolin ( 1 : 100 ) or anti - human mouse monoclonal antibodies for vimentin ( 1 : 100 ) followed by secondary antibody Alexa 488 labeled IgG ( 1 : 1000 ) and nuclei were stained with DAPI ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Four images from each slide were obtained using Carl Zeiss ' s Axio Scope A1 Polarized Light Fluorescent Microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) with 200× magni ﬁ cation and identical settings . The intensity of image color was quanti ﬁ ed using NIH image J software . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . DHA inhibits cAMP - induced cell migration in A549 cells MLE 12 and A549 cells were cultured and treated with 8Br - cAMP and / or DHA for 6 or 24 h either prior to or after plating into the transwell apparatus . In MLE12 cells , no changes in cell migration were observed due to treatments with the exception of a minor increase in the cAMP / DHA pre - treated cells at 24 h ( Figs . 1 , a and b ) . In A549 cells , a signi ﬁ cant increase in cell migration was observed with cAMP and cAMP / DHA treatment at 6 and 24 h in both pre - and post - treatment groups . DHA supplementation alone decreased cell migration and attenuated the increase in the cAMP / DHA treated cells at both time points and with pre - and post - treatment ( Figs . 1 , c and d ) . These data indicate that DHA supplementation , both before ( pre - ) or immediately after ( post - ) induction is able to suppress the pro - migratory effects of cAMP . 3 . 2 . DHA modulates the expression of gelsolin and vimentin To determine whether DHA supplementation suppressed the expres - sion of gelsolin or vimentin , Western blot analyses were performed on whole cell lysates obtained at 6 or 24 h after treatments . cAMP increased the expression of gelsolin in both MLE12 and A549 cell at 6 h and in MLE12 cells at 24 h ; the increase in MLE12 cells was substantially greater than A549 cells at 24 h ( Figs . 2 , a and c ) . DHA was able to attenuate the cAMP - induced increases in gelsolin in A549 cells at 6 h . Vimentin expres - sion was unaffected by any treatment in MLE12 cells ( Fig . 2 , b ) . In A549 cells , a modest decrease in vimentin expression was observed in the 2 M . Ali et al . / LifeSciences155 ( 2016 ) 1 – 9 cAMP / DHAdoubletreatedcellsat6handincreasesinvimentinwithDHA alone and cAMP / DHA at 24 h . Overall , the data indicate that DHA supple - mentation has a suppressive effect on gelsolin in both cell lines at both time points . DHA supplementation did not affect expression of vimentin in MLE12 cells and caused a modest increase in vimentin levels in A549 cells . 3 . 3 . Confocal images at the wound edge Confocal analysis of gelsolin ( Fig . 3 , a ) demonstrated a decrease in gelsolin expression at the leading edges of wound closure in MLE12 cells with both cAMP and DHA for both pre - and post - treatment at 6 h and 24 h ( Figs . 3 , b and c ) . A similar decrease was observed in A549 cells after cAMP pre - treatment ( Fig . 3 , d ) however , DHA pre - treatment alone caused an increase in gelsolin expression . The post - treatment of A549 cells demonstrated a decrease in gelsolin expression much like that observed in the MLE12 cells ( Fig . 3 , e ) . Vimentin expression analysis in MLE12 cells by confocal microscopy ( Fig . 4 , a ) revealed a decrease in expression levels with DHA pre - treatment at 6 h and 24 h ( Fig . 4 , b ) . Conversely , an increase in vimentin expression was observed in MLE12 cells that were post - treated with cAMP , DHA , or cAMP / DHA double treatment at both 6 h and 24 h ( Fig . 4 , c ) . In A549 cells pre - treated with DHA , cAMP induced vimentin expression at 6 h with no effect at 24 h ( Fig . 4 , d ) . In post - treated A549 cells , cAMP increased and DHA decreased expression at 24 h ( Fig . 4 , e ) . 3 . 4 . Gelsolin and Vimentin upregulated in lung cancer tissues The translational potential of our ﬁ ndings was assessed by measur - ing gelsolin and vimentin levels in human lung cancer tissues . Tissue sections were treated to quantify the levels of gelsolin and vimentin in control tissue , the tumor invading front , and the tumor mid region , to differentiate the distribution of gelsolin and vimentin in relation to tumor growth and progression ( Fig . 5 ) . A non - signi ﬁ cant increase in gelsolin levels at both tumor sites was observed . Vimentin expression was signi ﬁ cantly greater in the tumor mid region of and a modest , non - signi ﬁ cantincreaseinvimentinwasobservedatthetumorinvasive front . 3 . 5 .

Discussion Much of the current cancer research is focused on the identi ﬁ cation of novel therapeutic modalities targeting processes that facilitate the metastatic phenotype [ 39 – 42 ] . Unfortunately , many anti - metastasis regimens have adverse effects on non - cancerous cell growth [ 43 – 45 ] , thereforecurrenteffortsarebeingemployedtosearchforuniqueagents that can selectively inhibit metastatic molecules / pathways in cancer cells . DHA supplementation has been shown to be ef ﬁ cacious in some cancers [ 20 , 46 , 47 ] , indicating a potential for DHA to be developed as an anti - cancer therapy in the future . The mechanism by which DHA effects cancer cell growth and progression , especially metastatic pheno - types including migration , has not yet been explored . Therefore , this study set out to identify the mechanism associated with the observed effect of DHA on the metastatic potential of cancer cells using MLE 12 and A549 cells . DHA supplementation alone decreased cell migration and attenuated the increase by cAMP in A549 but not MLE12 cells , at both 6 h and 24 h both with pre - and post - treatment ( Fig . 1 ) . While Fig . 2 .

Ali et al . / LifeSciences155 ( 2016 ) 1 – 9 we did not assess apoptosis as a potential variable in the migration studies , we observed no acute accumulation of dead or ﬂ oating cells indicating massive cells death was not likely responsible for our observations . In support of our ﬁ ndings , DHA has been shown to sup - presses the onset , growth , and progression of several diseases including cancers [ 16 , 17 , 20 , 48 ] .

Ali et al . / LifeSciences155 ( 2016 ) 1 – 9 US men aged 40 – 75 years , followed for 14 years [ 48 ] . Collectively , these studies support a role for DHA in metastatic phenotype inhibition as reported here . On a large scale omega - 3 fatty acids may act as an anti - cancer agent by manipulating multiple targets responsible for cancer development , including cell proliferation , cell survival , angiogenesis , in ﬂ ammation , metastasis , and epigenetic abnormalities [ 46 ] . Zhang , et al . in 2013 reported that DHA inhibited angiogenesis , tumor growth , and metasta - sis in vitro via a VEGF receptor 2 - dependent mechanism [ 20 ] . In other examples , DHA was found to suppress EGF - induced metastasis through an inhibition of EGFR and ErbB2 protein expression and the down - stream target uPA and MMP - 9 activation in SK - BR3 human breast cancer cells [ 51 ] . Our studies were designed to explore more basic pathways relevant to the development and progression of the “ metastatic phenotype ” , speci ﬁ cally focusing on actin binding protein - mediated actin dynamics . In this regard , actin binding proteins such as gelsolin and vimentin have been shown to participate in actin remodelling , a process known to enhance the formation of cell protrusive structures and thus metastatic phenotypes [ 52 – 56 ] . Therefore , in the current study , we tested the hypothesis that DHA treatment would alter the expression of the actin bindingproteinsgelsolinandvimentinandthussuppressthemetastatic phenotype . Western blot and confocal analysis indicated that DHA modulates expression of both gelsolin and vimentin differently in A549 cancer cells than in MLE12 control cells ( Fig . 2 ) . Western analyses showed that in MLE12 cells , cAMP exposure at 6 and 24 h induced gelsolin protein levels . This increase in gelsolin may be due to the dual role of gelsolin in both polymerizing as well as stabilizing actin ﬁ laments [ 57 ] . There was no effect of cAMP or DHA on vimentin in MLE12 cells ( Fig . 2 , b ) . As a major contributor to the metastatic phenotype [ 27 , 28 ] , changes in vimentin would not be expected in non - invasive MLE12 cells . In A549 cells , cAMP induced gelsolin while DHA was able to mod - estly attenuate this increase at 6 h but had no effect at 24 h . DHA alone andincombinationwithcAMPinduced vimentinat24 hwhichisinline with the invasive nature of A549 cells . Both proteins are necessary to maintain the high actin turn over and invasive phenotype and both gelsolin and vimentin are known to behighly expressed inprimary can - cercells [ 26 , 36 ] . SuppressionoftheeffectofcAMPbyDHAat6honboth proteinsinA549cellsindicatethepotentialthatDHAmaybeeffectiveat attenuating the increased expression of these proteins at shorter time periods or lower cell population numbers . Confocal analysis of gelsolin ( Fig . 3 ) and vimentin ( Fig . 4 ) at the edges of wounds indicates a negative correlation between the expres - sion of these proteins and metastatic phenotype . This data is in contrast with the whole cell homogenate protein levels in Fig . 2 and represents the difference between measuring gelsolin and vimentin expression in an entire plate of cells verses measuring the expression at the leading edge of a wound , where the cells are highly proliferative and potentially invasive . The pre - and post - treatments were performed to mimic the pre - and post - metastasis treatment of cancers . In MLE12 cells , DHA pre and post treatment decreased the levels of gelsolin at the leading edges of the wound and in this context gelsolin could be promoting actin stabilization ( Figs . 3 a , b and c ) . Inthecaseof A549 cells , adecrease in gelsolin levels withcAMP exposure wassurprising , and indicates that the role of gelsolin in this process is not straightforward ( Figs . 3 a , d and e ) . An increase in gelsolin with DHA at 6 h or 24 h pre - treatment could be due to DHA accumulation within the cell membrane and DHA is functioning to increase gelsolin levels to stabilize actin and to restrict cell migration in A549 cells . Vimentin expression was increased by cAMP in DHA pre - treated A549 cells at 6 h and was induced by cAMP and DHA in DHA post - treated MLE12 cells at 24 h ( Figs . 4 a , b , and c ) . DHA pre - treatment at 6 or 24 h caused a decrease in vimentin expression in MLE12 . In Fig . 5 . Immuno ﬂ uorescence of ABP in human lung tissue : Control and lung tumor ( invasive front and mid region ) tissues were analyzed by ﬂ uorescence microscopy for expression levels of gelsolin or vimentin ( green , blue represents nuclei ( DAPI ) ) .

Ali et al . / LifeSciences155 ( 2016 ) 1 – 9 contrast , DHA , pre - and post - treatment , 6 or 24 h , maintained or decreased normal expression of vimentin . While the results of the confocal analysis of the wound assay do not re ﬂ ect a direct correlation between cAMP treatment , expression of gelsolin and vimentin , and alter - ations with DHA supplementation , they do support the anti - migratory effects of DHA treatment . To investigate the translational relevance of our ﬁ ndings , we measured gelsolin and vimentin expression in human control and malignant lung tissues ( Fig . 5 ) . Immuno ﬂ uorescence analysis of gelsolin and vimentin expression in human lung tissues indicates a modest but signi ﬁ cant increase in vimentin in malignant lung tissue while gelsolin levels were not different . These ﬁ ndings are in line with our current cell data as well as previous studies [ 26 , 27 , 29 , 36 , 58 ] . Overall , our ﬁ ndings clearly indicate the DHA inhibits the lung cancer cell metastatic phenotype . While our data do not indicate a straightforward role for gelsolin or vimentin in cAMP induced cell migration , they do not rule out a possible role for other ABPs in this process ( Fig . 6 ) . Further investigations are needed using in - vivo and in - vitro experimental models to explore the mechanisms associated with the role of ABPs and the effects of DHA supplementation on these activities . Importantly , theabilityof DHA to precisely regulatelungcancer cell metastatic phenotype represents innovative therapeutic for patients with metastatic cancers .
