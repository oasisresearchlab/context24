Decoding Shc Deviance : Evidence of Novel Roles for the Phosphotyrosine Adaptor ShcD in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) Signalling and Dynamics By Melanie K . B . Wills A Thesis presented to The University of Guelph In partial fulfillment of requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Molecular and Cellular Biology Guelph , Ontario , Canada © Melanie K . B . Wills , April 2016 ABSTRACT Decoding Shc Deviance : Evidence of Novel Roles for the Phosphotyrosine Adaptor ShcD in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) Signalling and Dynamics Melanie K . B . Wills Advisor : University of Guelph , 2016 Dr . Nina Jones Cell signal transduction requires an organized cascade of enzymatic conversions and molecular recognition events to convert external messages into physiological responses . Central participants in such pathways are the transmembrane Receptor Tyrosine Kinases ( RTKs ) , including the well - characterized Epidermal Growth Factor ( EGF ) Receptors , which situate at the cell surface to intercept incoming signals . Upon stimulation , the intracellular tail of the RTK recruits proteins such as those of the Shc adaptor family , which help to nucleate the developing transduction complex . Additionally , Shc proteins have been implicated in post - stimulus receptor endocytosis owing to a short sequence , known as the AP2 adaptin binding motif , which is conserved across the majority of Shc proteins . ShcD is the fourth and most - recently discovered Shc homolog , sharing substantial amino acid identity with its better - known counterpart , ShcA , as well as possessing some distinguishing characteristics that have not been investigated . We now report that ShcD challenges the canonical signalling paradigm by promoting ligand - independent EGFR activation , and sequestering the phosphorylated receptor in the perinuclear area , thereby reducing cellular EGF uptake and suppressing the downstream activation of Erk . EGFR hyperphosphorylation is a cell autonomous effect that requires the intrinsic EGFR kinase and the ShcD PhosphoTyrosine Binding ( PTB ) domain , and it primarily affects residues Y1068 , Y1148 and Y1173 . Meanwhile , a central residue in receptor fate determination , Y1045 , appears to remain unmodified in the presence of ShcD . To assess the molecular determinants of subcellular localization , we transplanted the ShcA AP2 binding motif into the analogous region of ShcD , and discovered that the resulting chimeric protein retains the capacity to facilitate ligand - independent EGFR phosphorylation , but restores ligand uptake in the cell , suggesting that ShcD possess several molecular permutations that subvert the canonical EGFR cascade . We have additionally found evidence of transcriptional ShcD upregulation in brain tumours , which are also frequently associated with dysregulated EGFR signalling . In our cellular model of a grade IV glioma , EGFR - ShcD synergy can be recapitulated . In light of our findings , we challenge the designation of ShcD as a traditional phosphotyrosine signalling adaptor , and suggest instead that it is actively involved in sculpting the transduction framework . iv DEDICATION This work is dedicated to my high school science teachers and mentors , Dr .

Indeed , the past three decades have witnessed both the birth and evolution of the signal transduction discipline , founded on observations that tyrosine phosphorylation could mediate oncogenic transformation of cells ( 1 ) , and propelled by the subsequent discovery of a conserved phosphotyrosine recognition region , henceforth termed a Src Homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain , that was evident in several cytosolic kinases and responsible for orchestrating the cellular consequences of phosphorylation ( 2 , 3 ) . The concept that protein interactions are mediated by distinct , highly discerning , independently - folded domains has since proven to be a unifying paradigm in cell signalling regulation ( 3 , 4 ) . Possession of one or more of these modules confers specific abilities to the parent protein irrespective of its other functions , thereby endowing the cell with a method of recycling and recombining successful signalling strategies ( 5 ) . Shortly after postulation of the domain theory , a novel protein came to light that was defined by an SH2 domain and the absence of any apparent catalytic function , thereby distinguishing it from the majority of known SH2 proteins of the day , such as Src and PLC γ ( 6 ) . Indeed , the S rc H omology and C ollagen ( Shc ) protein was one of the first characterized cellular adaptors , and remains a prototype for this class of molecule ( 7 ) that functions to recruit and juxtapose several sequential members of a pathway ( 5 ) . Broadly , adaptors may serve to amplify or convert signals , or organize substrates in a cascade , and are defined by the unique complement of modules and amino acid motifs that equip them to participate in the transduction process ( 8 ) . In the ensuing twenty years since Shc was first revealed , three additional related proteins have been identified in mammals , prompting the common designations ShcA , B , C , and D , according to their order of discovery . The family is best characterized by its participation in the major pathways of growth factor signalling , especially the Ras / Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase ( MAPK ) and Phosphatidylinositol - 3 Kinase ( PI3K ) / Akt cascades proximal to various stimuli conveyed through receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) , integrins , and cytosolic kinases , as well as cytokine , antigen , and G - protein coupled receptors ( 7 ) . Additionally , the 66 kDa isoform of ShcA performs unconventional roles in the cellular stress response ( 9 ) . All homologs share a 3 common architecture defined by an amino - terminal Phosphotyrosine Binding ( PTB ) domain and a carboxy - terminal SH2 domain , both of which can independently coordinate phosphorylated tyrosine residues of active receptors . The domains are connected by a central Collagen Homology 1 ( CH1 ) region containing consensus tyrosine residues that are subject to phosphorylation upon engagement of the adaptor with a receptor , and subsequently serve as recognition motifs for proximal signalling effectors ( 10 ) . Thus , by relocating to receptors in response to stimuli , and recruiting downstream transduction components , Shc proteins provide a molecular platform for development of the signalling complex . As the past decades have revealed though , the diversity of cellular processes involving these adaptors places Shc at a signalling crossroad , where its influence may extend beyond individual cascades to encompass pathway integration . 1 . 1 . 2 Shc discovery and characterization Identification of the first Shc adaptor arose from efforts to elucidate novel SH2 domain - containing proteins , in attempt to better define the mechanisms of tyrosine kinase signalling . Using a DNA probe designed against the SH2 domain of the c - fes tyrosine kinase , Pelicci and colleagues screened human cDNA libraries for complementary sequences . Their search yielded a homolog sharing considerable identity with the SH2 domains of other proteins , most notably the cytosolic kinase Src ( 60 % ) ( 6 ) . Further inspection of the ShcA gene and its products revealed three protein isoforms , designated p66 , p52 , and p46 for the respective molecular masses in kilodaltons ( kDa ) ( Figure 1 . 1 ) . Structurally , the proteins are identical through the PTB - CH1 - SH2 core , and are solely distinguished by length of their amino termini . p46 and p52 are generated from different start codons within the same transcript , while p66 is a product of alternative splicing that endows it with a unique N - terminal 110 amino acid extension ( 11 ) . Functionally , Shc proteins gained early notoriety as molecular mediators of phosphotyrosine - based signalling events ( 12 ) . Targeted gene perturbation studies in mice have since revealed striking functional differences between the ShcA isoforms . While concurrent disruption of p66 , p52 , and p46 results in embryonic lethality by E11 . 5 ( 13 ) , animals lacking p66 alone experience a 30 % increase in life span , owing to the transcript’s involvement in cellular oxidative stress , and 4 rendering p66 ShcA one of a small subset of human genes that has been implicated in the ageing process ( 9 ) . Although p46 and p52 are broadly expressed across various tissues and developmental time points , p66 is notably absent from select cell types , including those of hematopoietic lineage ( 6 , 14 ) . It has also become apparent that all ShcA isoforms are markedly downregulated in quiescent cells of the mature central nervous system ( 15 ) . Accordingly , several independent groups identified two novel homologs in the human and mouse brain , that were believed to assume phosphotyrosine adaptor responsibilities in the absence of ShcA ( 16 - 18 ) . ShcB ( Sck / Sli / Shc2 ) is commonly reported as a single 68 kDa protein ( 19 - 21 ) , while ShcC ( Rai / N - Shc / Shc3 ) is often cited as two isoforms of 64 kDa and 52 kDa ( 21 - 25 ) . In contrast to the embryonic - lethal ShcA - null animals , single and compound ShcB / C knockout mice are viable , although subject to reductions in specific neuron populations [ 19 ] . The paradigm of Shc signalling within and beyond the nervous system stands to be challenged again , by the more recent discovery of another mammalian homolog , ShcD ( Shc4 / RaLP ( Rai - Like Protein ) ) . This adaptor was revealed by two separate groups as a result of Basic Local Alignment Search Tool ( BLAST ) queries of the mouse and human genomes ( 26 , 27 ) . Protein and RNA profiling in the mouse has identified ShcD in an array of embryonic and adult tissues , and shown that it is differentially regulated through development ( 28 ) . Its expression pattern is distinct from that of the other Shc proteins , and includes notable representation in the central nervous system , muscle , epithelia , and bone precursors ( 28 ) . Although the contributions of this protein to organismal development and maintenance have yet to be determined , incentive now exists to address this gap in adaptor knowledge . 1 . 1 . 3 Shc protein architecture As discussed , ShcA was first identified as an SH2 domain - containing protein , thereby establishing its role in phosphotyrosine signalling . However , the subsequent discovery and characterization of an additional novel domain capable of coordinating phosphorylated tyrosine residues ( 29 , 30 ) revealed this N - terminal PTB domain to be the dominant point of contact between ShcA and many of its ligands ( 7 ) . In its unbound state prior to co - ordinating a target ligand , the PTB domain is structurally disordered ; only upon complex formation does the fully - folded structure emerge ( 31 ) . Analyses of peptide - bound domains demonstrate that , despite 5 differences in gross architecture , the core phosphotyrosine ( pY ) binding pockets of the Shc PTB and SH2 modules share a related conformation and amino acid composition , characterized by non - contiguous RRKS residues ( 32 ) . Nevertheless , the domains are selective for different amino acid motifs in their compatible ligands , with SH2 target specificity defined by residues C - terminal to the pY , and having the sequence pY Φ X - I / L / M ( Φ representing a hydrophobic moiety ) ( 33 ) , while the PTB domain recognizes the phosphorylated residue in an N - terminal context given by NPXpY , with Ile or a similar hydrophobic amino acid at the - 5 position relative to pY ( 34 ) . Notable exceptions to tyrosine specificity of the domain include phospho - independent interactions with cytoskeletal regulator IQGAP1 ( 35 ) , as well as phosphatases PTP - PEST ( 36 ) , protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) ( 37 ) , and protein - tyrosine phosphatase epsilon ( PTP ε ) ( 38 ) . Intriguingly , the Shc PTB domain also resembles phospholipid - binding Pleckstrin Homology ( PH ) domains . Using residues distinct from the pTyr binding pocket , it selectively co - ordinates phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ) and related components of the membrane bilayer , albeit with lower affinity than the tyrosine interaction ( 32 , 39 ) . Although PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 does not affect the PTB - pTyr association ( 40 ) , phosphotyrosine engagement with the domain does decrease its phospholipid affinity ( 32 ) , suggesting that Shc could be thermodynamically driven from the membrane to activated receptors , but not vice - versa . Indeed , lipid interaction is considered instrumental in preemptively targeting ShcA to the membrane and positioning it in proximity to certain receptors , including IL - 3 ( 39 ) . Of note , some of the residues responsible for phospholipid recognition are absent from ShcD , despite their conservation in the other Shc homologs ( 27 ) . The consequence of this deletion on subcellular localization and signalling response of the adaptor have not directly been addressed , although ShcD is considered a physiologically relevant substrate of several RTKs ( 26 , 27 ) . In all vertebrate Shc proteins , the PTB and SH2 domains are connected by a CH1 region rich in proline residues ( 11 , 22 ) that can contribute to PXXP motifs that bind Src Homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains of cellular kinases such as Src , Fyn , and Lyn ( 8 ) . The best characterized features of the region , however , are conserved tyrosine residues in positions 239 / 240 , and 317 of p52 ShcA that become phosphorylated upon engagement of Shc proteins with active kinases , and represent canonical pYXNX recognition motifs for the Ras / MAPK signalling adaptor , Grb2 ( 10 ) . Additionally , ShcC and D contain novel tyrosine phosphorylation sites that can coordinate the Crk and Grb2 adaptors , respectively ( Figure 1 . 1 , peach residues ) ( 26 , 41 ) . More recently , sites of serine and threonine phosphorylation have also been identified in ShcA . The motifs are 6 targets of Akt , Erk , and protein kinase C ( PKC ) feedback regulation , and occur after the initial wave of tyrosine phosphorylation ( 42 , 43 ) . Near the carboxy - terminal end of the CH1 region lies a binding motif for the adaptin proteins involved in clathrin - mediated internalization ( 44 ) . This RDLFDMKPFE sequence ( 44 ) is notably absent from ShcD , yet conserved in ShcA , B , and C ( Figure 1 . 1 , teal ) ( 26 , 27 ) . Unique to the longer isoforms of the four Shc proteins is an amino - terminal Collagen Homology 2 ( CH2 ) region , which is likewise enriched in glycine and proline residues ( 11 ) . This attribute is particularly salient in ShcD , which contains several SH3 domain recognition sequences of undetermined utility ( 26 ) . Adjacent to the PTB domain is a phosphorylatable motif with regulatory functions , identified as S29 of p52 ShcA and S138 of p66 ( 42 , 43 ) . Sequence alignments suggest that ShcD may harbor an analogous residue at S162 . The CH2 region has been most intensively scrutinized in p66 ShcA , as it constitutes the structural epicenter of the adaptor’s oxidative stress response . As described below , at least three key sequences contribute to this function : an S36 / P37 motif that undergoes phosphorylation ( 9 ) , C59 that mediates tetramerization ( 45 ) , and a cytochrome c ( cyt c ) binding region ( CB ) that doubles as a catalytic core to generate reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) ( 46 ) . Although present in p52 ShcA , the CB region has been deemed nonfunctional ( 46 ) . Intriguingly , ShcD shares the C59 oligomerization residue ( 45 ) , and may also possess the p66 S - P motif , as revealed by sequence alignment ( 26 , 27 ) . Overall , the CH2 - PTB - CH1 - SH2 orientation uniquely distinguishes Shc adaptors , and although PTB and SH2 domains are individually common in signalling proteins , they are rarely found within the same molecule ( 22 ) . Amino acid sequence comparisons reveal that ShcA and D share the highest identity ( Figure 1 . 1 ) . Across the family , the PTB and SH2 domains are most conserved , while the CH1 and CH2 regions are more divergent ( 26 ) . Striking similarity in exon organization between human ShcA , B , and C argues that they arose from a common ancestral gene , as does the existence of apparent orthologs in Drosophila and Fugu rubripes , and putative loci in Caenorhabditis elegans ( 22 ) . Interestingly , the nematode lacks both pTyr consensus sites of the CH1 region , while the fly contains a Y239 / 240 sequence that becomes phosphorylated upon stimulation ( 22 , 47 ) . This motif , and Y317 , are found in all vertebrate Shc adaptors , thus implying that expanded phosphotyrosine signalling capacity is associated with increased organismal complexity ( 22 ) . 7 Figure 1 . 1 . Shc protein architecture . Mammalian homologs share a common modular structure and conserved CH1 region tyrosine ( Y ) residues ( green ) . Three novel tyrosine phosphorylation sites are found within the CH1 region of ShcC and D ( peach ) , while a serine ( S ) residue in the CH2 region of p66 ShcA ( yellow ) is required for the oxidative stress response . It has likewise been detected in ShcD , although it is not known whether the residue undergoes phosphorylation . Cysteine residues ( C , blue ) involved in oligomerization , and a cytochrome c binding motif and catalytic core ( CB , purple ) are also found in the CH2 region of select Shc proteins . The adaptin binding motif ( A , teal ) is conserved in all homologs except ShcD . Percent amino acid identity relative to ShcA is given above the PTB and SH2 domains of ShcB , C , and D . 8 1 . 1 . 4 Regulation Fundamentally , the ability of Shc proteins to engage in controlled signal propagation in a given cell is contingent on their expression , localization , target recognition , and acquisition and removal of phosphate moieties , all of which must proceed in an orchestrated manner . While efforts have focused on elucidating details of ShcA dynamics , ShcB , C , and D remain relatively unexplored from a regulatory perspective . As previously noted , the isoforms of ShcA are differentially expressed ( 6 ) . Analysis of the locus has revealed two promoters of the TATA - / Inr + class that independently regulate transcription of p46 / p52 , and p66 , the latter of which can be epigenetically repressed through cytosine methylation and histone deacetylation ( 14 ) . Homolog and isoform specific differences also extend to subcellular localization of the proteins . In neurons , for example , ShcB is distributed throughout the soma and processes , while ShcC is limited to the cell body ( 48 ) . Elsewhere , ShcA is predominantly a cytoplasmic protein that can concentrate in cellular niches . An amino - terminal targeting sequence in p46 that is masked in the longer isoforms uniquely allows this adaptor to accumulate in the mitochondrial matrix ( 49 ) . Conversely , a fraction of p66 can relocate to the mitochondrial intermembrane space in response to appropriate apoptotic stimuli ( 46 , 50 , 51 ) . Some estimates suggest that roughly 5 % of p52 ShcA is already membrane associated in unstimulated cells ( 39 ) , however it is generally observed in the cytosol and rough endoplasmic reticulum , from which it translocates to the periphery upon growth factor stimulation ( 52 , 53 ) . Subsequently , rapid phosphorylation of Shc proteins upon binding active RTKs is a vital step in the transduction process that primes the adaptor to interact with downstream partners . Recent evidence suggests , however , that the implications of Shc post - translational modification extend beyond generating recognition motifs for effectors . George et al . report that although the isolated SH2 domain of p52ShcA binds representative target ligands in solution , it loses this ability in the context of the full - length Shc protein . Strikingly , phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the CH1 region not only restores SH2 - mediated binding , but also enhances the affinity of the interaction 50 - fold , implying that the Shc protein employs a phospho - dependent switch that inducibly controls SH2 activation ( 40 ) . Conversely , molecular dynamics simulations and in silico binding free energy estimates predict that the conformational change 9 accompanying phosphorylation of Y317 decreases Shc affinity for representative ligands . This single modification was found to enhance structural rigidity of the adaptor and decouple the concerted movement of the PTB and SH2 domains ( 54 , 55 ) , thereby disrupting the interaction of both domains with their cognate motifs on the Epidermal Growth Factor ( EGF ) RTK ( 55 ) . Considering that Shc engagement with a stimulated receptor potentiates the signal and also protects the RTK from phosphatases , this structural shift is postulated to control detachment of the adaptor following its activation , thereby facilitating eventual termination of the transduction process ( 55 ) . However , the model does not account for additional phosphorylation at residues Y239 / 240 , which usually occurs concomitantly with Y317 . Whether this further alters molecular conformation remains to be seen . Under these circumstances , biochemical and molecular simulation data appear to predict contradictory consequences of CH1 phosphorylation , though this may be the result of differences in experimental approaches . The biochemical perspective focused on the influence of phosphorylation in modifying the binding behaviour of the SH2 domain toward receptor motifs with which it failed to interact in its full - length , inactive form . Unlike the in silico analysis , it did not consider the consequences of Shc phosphorylation on interactions for which the SH2 domain is a physiologically relevant principle point of contact . Thus , it is possible that the models describe independent , concurrent phenomena , or that the regulatory mechanisms are distinct and exclusive to certain subsets of receptor - adaptor interactions . In the former scenario , Shc phosphorylation by its partner RTK could conceivably destabilize the primary , PTB - mediated interaction , while simultaneously priming a secondary association between the SH2 domain and another ligand . Indeed , the utility of the double domain structure of Shc and its contributions to signalling cross talk are presently undercharacterized . Beyond their direct implications for Shc signalling , these discoveries also challenge the assumption that independently folded domains act as fully autonomous modules within signalling proteins . Instead , they paint a more dynamic picture of contextual adaptability and regulation , hinting at subtle mechanisms by which transducers could integrate information . The findings likewise emphasize the requirement to regulate Shc phosphorylation , and indeed studies have revealed a small repertoire of phosphatase enzymes capable of this task . The first to be identified was the ubiquitous protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP - PEST , which interacts constitutively with the PTB domains of p52 and p66 ShcA via an unconventional NPLH recognition motif in its carboxy - terminus ( 36 , 56 ) . The association is further enhanced by 10 treatment with a diacylglycerol ( DAG ) second messenger analog , which induces PKC - dependent serine phosphorylation of ShcA p52 at residue 29 , and thereby provides an additional binding sequence for PTP - PEST ( 42 , 56 ) . Importantly , this association has been found to reduce Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Shc - mediated MAPK activation following insulin signalling ( 42 ) , and during antigen receptor - stimulated lymphocyte activation ( 57 ) . Tumor suppressor PTEN , PP2A , and PTP ε are likewise capable of dephosphorylating Shc , impeding its interaction with Grb2 and suppressing subsequent MAPK activation ( 37 , 38 , 58 ) . Notably , a role has been established for PTEN in negatively regulating Shc - mediated cell migration ( 58 , 59 ) , thus implicating the phosphatase - adaptor interaction in the metastatic mechanism . Like PTP - PEST , PP2A and PTP ε stably associate with the ShcA PTB domain under basal conditions , however both phosphatases demonstrate distinct context - dependent regulation of ShcA . In the case of PP2A , growth factor stimulation and consequent phosphorylation of Shc Y317 inhibit the phosphatase and cause it to dissociate from the adaptor ( 37 ) . Within 30 minutes of signal initiation , the interaction is restored . Conversely , the capacities of the three ShcA isoforms to act as PTP ε substrates depend on the kinase used initially to phosphorylate the adaptor , and whether it confers a protective effect due to complex formation . Proximal to the cytosolic kinase Src , Shc is subject to dephosphorylation by PTP ε , while it is resistant to the phosphatase when downstream of RTKs including Neu and EGFR ( 38 ) . This is postulated to reflect the difference in affinities between the kinases and adaptor , and competitive PTB domain engagement by protective RTKs that likely precludes phosphatase binding . Although the finer details of Shc regulation are still subject to investigation , it is evident that numerous mechanisms integrate these adaptors into cellular networks that require inducible , reversible , and highly specific interactions to maintain homeostasis . 11 1 . 2 The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor : modelling form and function of signal transduction Shc adaptors are best characterized as mediators of RTK signal transduction , and much of what is known about their participation in these cascades has arisen from studies involving the EGF Receptor . The EGFR is one of four RTKs in its family , so named because its influence was first described in epidermal layers of the developing mouse eyelid ( 60 ) . The initial discovery of a soluble , diffusible factor that promoted cell proliferation ( EGF ) was subsequently followed by the identification of a transmembrane receptor protein possessing kinase activity that was capable of autophosphorylation in the presence of ligand ( 61 , 62 ) . As such , EGFR became the first documented RTK , and it remains a prototype for all facets of growth factor signalling ( 63 ) . Structually , EGFR is characterized by four extracellular domains at the amino terminus that collaborate to coordinate ligand , a transmembrane helix that anchors the receptor in the lipid bilayer , a cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region involved in regulation , a kinase domain , and carboxy tail that is enriched with phosphorylatable recognition motifs to recruit transduction components ( 64 , 65 ) . Among the proximal targets are major signalling hubs : Ras / MAPK ( including Erk and Jnk ) , PI ( 3 ) K / Akt , PLC γ / PKC , STAT3 and STAT5 ( 66 ) . Activation of such cascades ultimately drives cellular responses including proliferation , differentiation , and migration , in a context - dependent manner . Indeed , homologs belonging to the EGFR ( ErbB / HER ) family make profound contributions to development and disease , and are among the most intensively studied proteins in cancer research ( 67 ) . EGFR itself is responsive to seven known ligands in humans , four of which are specific to this receptor ( EGF , transforming growth factor alpha ( TGF - α ) , amphiregulin ( ARG ) , and epigen ( EGN ) ) while another three are shared with ErbB4 ( heparin binding EGF - like growth factor ( HB - EGF ) , epiregulin ( EPR ) , and betacellulin ( BTC ) ) ( 68 ) . Additionally , several ligand - independent activation strategies exist , rendering EGFR overexpression and activating mutations commonplace in select cancers ( 69 ) . The molecular mechanisms of the EGFR have been revealed in increasingly fine detail ; likewise , the therapeutic potential of targeting this family in cancer is being exploited . 12 Nevertheless , the global significance of EGFR in organismal physiology has been somewhat challenging to decipher . Multiple genetic rodent models exist in which EGFR has been knocked out , and the findings generated from these lines are inconsistent ( 70 ) . Mice succumb to the consequences of EGFR deletion at different developmental stages depending on their genetic background , and the primary morbidities also differ between models . What can be gleaned from these studies is that EGFR is involved in a wide variety of cell types , and ultimately contributes to the development and function of the lungs , heart , bone , brain , and various epithelia ( 70 ) . Moreover , the relevance of this system transcends vertebrate signalling , as both EGFR and Shc homologs DER and dShc respectively are present in Drosophila , where they demonstrably interact ( 47 ) . 1 . 2 . 1 Canonical signalling through the EGFR and Shc Modern phosphoproteomic approaches and imaging techniques have provided sophisticated , time - resolved analyses of EGFR dynamics following stimulation . These studies have revealed multiple stages of post - translational modification , relocation , and a co - evolving interactome in the wake of ligand exposure ( 43 , 71 ) . This dynamic complex is thus responsible for executing the signal and regulating its outcomes . For both EGFR and ShcA , tyrosine phosphorylation occurs immediately upon stimulation , and is associated with mitogenic signalling through pathways such as Ras - MAPK and PI ( 3 ) K ( 43 , 71 ) . These early modifications also establish the framework to recruit internalization and trafficking factors that enable the receptor to enter the cell in response to ligand , albeit with much slower kinetics than those of the signalling transactions . A subsequent wave of serine / threonine phosphorylation events on both EGFR and ShcA represent feedback regulation , and accumulate over unique time frames ( 43 , 71 , 72 ) . Accordingly , the trajectory of the stimulated receptor can be delineated into two or more distinct , albeit overlapping , phases that will be examined in greater depth . 1 . 2 . 1 . 1 Early events : signalling Stimulus response begins when ligand binds to domains I and III of the EGFR extracellular region , thereby stabilizing an extended ( untethered ) conformation that promotes asymmetric dimerization of the individual receptor monomers , and facilitates activation of the kinase domains ( 67 , 73 ) . The process is additionally governed by the juxtamembrane region , which 13 exerts allosteric control over the enzyme and is further subject to modification by cytoplasmic components ( 65 , 74 ) . Trans - autophosphorylation of conserved tyrosine residues on the EGFR cytoplasmic tail then generates recognition motifs for downstream targets . Uniquely , three such residues in EGFR seem to coordinate ShcA . Numbered according to the mature EGFR protein ( and classical nomenclature ) , pTyr - 992 is a minor SH2 domain binding site , while pTyr - 1148 dominantly engages the PTB domain and pTyr - 1173 is considered a secondary motif that facilitates interaction with both the PTB and SH2 domains of ShcA ( 75 - 77 ) . Although the sites initially appeared redundant ( 78 ) , subsequent analyses have found a more robust signalling output when the PTB domain is involved ( 77 ) , and raise the possibility that optimal MAPK activation may be achieved through cooperation of both domains ( 79 ) . Paradoxically , a dissenting line of evidence contends that Shc is responsive to EGF stimulation even after compound ablation of all aforementioned phospho - sites ( 80 , 81 ) , however an alternative explanation is proposed below . Recent quantitative proteomic analyses of signalling events have revealed that phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr - 1148 and Tyr - 1173 occurs within 5 seconds of ligand engagement , followed immediately by recruitment and phosphorylation of Shc ( 82 ) . Accordingly , EGF stimulation appears to have two distinct effects on the intrinsic kinase of the RTK ; in addition to increasing the general catalytic activity of the enzyme by promoting dimerization , EGF also alters substrate specificity and enhances the affinity of the kinase active site to Shc Tyr - 317 ( 83 ) . Considering that the activation of another proximal EGFR partner , PLC γ , lags behind Shc ( 82 ) , the possibility thus exists that a temporal component partly defines the consequences of transduction . Evidence further suggests that ShcA can mobilize directly from the cytoplasm to EGFR without prior association with membrane phospholipids , although this is not true for all receptors . Interaction between ShcA and IL - 3 , for example , can be abrogated by mutating the three key residues in the PTB domain that constitute a phospholipid - binding pocket ( 39 ) . p66 , p52 , and p46 ShcA are all subject to phosphorylation ( 53 ) on two consensus binding motifs for the Grb2 adaptor , corresponding to Y239 / 240 and Y317 in the CH1 region of human p52 ( 10 ) , as detected both in vitro ( 6 , 53 ) and in vivo in the mouse and rat ( 15 , 84 ) . Y239 / 240 ( 10 ) and Y317 ( 85 ) have each been proposed as the dominant Grb2 binding site that recruits the adaptor into the developing transduction complex . According to the latter scenario , Y317 mediates MAPK activation , while Y239 / 240 stimulates c - myc expression by unknown 14 mechanisms ( 85 ) . Notably though , the EGFR variant used in these experiments lacked the Shc binding sites , so the outcome may not represent canonical EGFR signalling . Regardless of the motif ( s ) of origin , activation of the MAPK cascade as detailed in Figure 1 . 2A and 1 . 3A is the best - characterized outcome of signalling through p52 and p46 ShcA ( 7 , 11 ) . In contrast to these isoforms , however , p66 fails to augment MAPK phosphorylation upon ligand stimulation , despite binding both EGFR and Grb2 ( Figure 1 . 3B ) ( 11 , 53 , 86 , 87 ) . The response is particularly perplexing considering that p66 shares identical PTB , CH1 , and SH2 structures with the shorter p52 / 46 isoforms . Nevertheless , a model has emerged whereby the adaptor is recruited to active EGFR , phosphorylated first on tyrosine by the RTK , and then on serine / threonine residues of the CH2 region in a MEK - dependent manner ( 86 ) . Although the pTyr motifs bind and recruit Grb2 , Ser / Thr phosphorylation destabilizes the p66 – EGFR interaction , thereby decoupling the fledgling signalling complex from Ras , and sequestering Grb2 - SOS away from the membrane and the other ShcA isoforms , which are not subject to phospho - Ser / Thr regulation ( Figure 1 . 3B ) ( 86 ) . The consequences of this behaviour include accelerated inactivation of Erk ( 86 ) and suppressed transcription from the c - fos promoter , which is specifically attributed to the CH2 region ( 11 ) . Despite the focus on coordinating Grb2 , phospho - independent interactions have also surfaced that diversify the downstream consequences of Shc signalling . Proximal to EGF family receptors , ShcA and the scaffold IQGAP1 have been identified in membrane ruffles , where they associate via the Shc PTB domain ( 35 ) . As ShcA can have a role in lamellipodia formation , the interaction is postulated to connect RTK activation to cytoskeletal reorganization through Shc ( 35 ) . 15 16 Figure 1 . 2 . Canonical mechanisms of EGFR and ShcA in MAPK signalling and endocytosis . ( A ) Engagement with ligand ( red circle ) enables the extracellular domains of the EGFR to adopt an extended conformation , thereby facilitating dimerization . This promotes activation of the kinase domain , and resulting autophosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic region ( green circle ) , which serve as recognition motifs for the Shc PTB and / or SH2 domains , as well as a collection of other transduction and regulatory components , including Grb2 and c - Cbl . The intrinsic EGFR kinase likewise phosphorylates tyrosine residues of the Shc CH1 region , to which the Grb2 adaptor can also bind . Activation of the Ras GTPase causes recruitment and activation of the first in the kinase cascade , Raf , which initiates a chain of stimulatory phosphorylation events that ultimately produces active , dimerized Erk ( MAPK ) , which can operate in the cytosol or translocate to the nucleus to phosphorylate transcription factors . ( B ) Stimulation also enables both ubiquitylation ( yellow circles ) and interaction between EGFR and the AP2 adaptor complex ( not shown ) , which may be additionally promoted by ShcA , B , and C . EGFR is recruited to areas of clathrin enrichment in the membrane ( dashed lines ) , which form pits and undergo dynamin - mediated scission . Non - clathrin endocytosis ( NCE ) has also been described , although the details of this mechanism are highly contested . Following internalization , clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCV ) shed their triskelia and deliver cargo to early endosomes ( EEs ) , where the content is sorted by members of the ESCRT family , including Hrs . Under appropriate conditions , EGFR can be immediately returned to the surface via a fast recycling route . Alternatively , receptors destined for degradation remain in the vesicle as it translocates along microtubules toward the juxtanuclear space . The physical movement of the endosome is accompanied by changes in protein composition and decreasing pH , as it matures into a multivesicular body ( MVB ) . From here , the receptor may be sent to a perinuclear recycling compartment ( PRC ) that eventually returns it to the membrane . Meanwhile , cargo destined for the lysosome involute to produce intraluminal vesicles ( ILV ) , thereby removing the EGFR carboxy tail from the cytosol . The MVB continues to mature into a late endosome , which fuses with the lysosome to facilitate proteolytic digestion of its contents . Representative compartmental markers are noted . Adapted from : ( 66 , 88 - 92 ) . 17 1 . 2 . 1 . 2 Late events : endocytosis and regulation In the realm of cellular communication , successful outcomes depend not only on the appropriate activation of receptor and effectors , but also on the orchestrated relocation of the components from the plasma membrane through a series of intracellular vesicles , as depicted in Figure 1 . 2B . The various compartments are defined by function , and identified on the basis of their unique protein composition , which largely consists of specific Rab GTPases and their effectors that govern the collective transactions of membrane transport ( 92 ) . Internalization of the EGFR is a vital step in ligand - mediated transduction that has both informatic and regulatory functions . Endocytic vesicles serve to remove engaged receptors from the cell surface , and provide a platform for a variety of signalling exchanges ( 93 ) . The endocytosis machinery also determines the fate of the EGFR , either resetting and recycling it to the plasma membrane to intercept future stimuli , or relegating it to the lysosome for degradation . Underlying this phenomenon is a network of components that generate , and then decipher , signature patterns in post - translational modifications ( 94 ) . Despite rigorous and ongoing investigation , the driving mechanisms and governing paradigms are incompletely understood and remain contentious , although intriguing models are emerging from the data . In particular , research has focused on several key themes , including the mechanics of EGFR internalization , the conditions and components that determine receptor fate , and the intracellular coordination that integrates the various inputs to mount an appropriate response . To that end , at least two modes of internalization have been postulated for EGFR , which are broadly defined by the protein composition and architecture of the vesicles that form at the plasma membrane , as well as their rate of uptake . Regardless of the method of entry into the cell , all pathways are thought to converge on the common endomembrane system depicted in Figure 1 . 2B . The predominant and best - characterized route is clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , which specifically describes internalization of cargo from the surface via pits and vesicles that are coated in a clathrin protein lattice ( 89 ) . CME is considered the more rapid method of EGFR uptake . Unique and central to this process is the adaptor protein complex AP2 . This heterotetramer , composed of α , β 2 , µ2 , and σ 2 adaptin subunits , binds to plasma membrane 18 phospholipids and engages in selection of cargo destined for internalization , linking it to the clathrin triskelia that polymerize across the cytoplasmic surface of the developing pit ( 89 ) . Although AP2 was identified as a direct binding partner of EGFR two decades ago ( 95 , 96 ) , the requirement for this adaptor in EGFR endocytosis remains somewhat contested . In an early study that strategically deleted or substituted residues within the C - terminus of EGFR , Sorkin et al . determined that AP2 interaction is predominantly mediated through the 973 - FYRAL - 977 motif ( 97 ) . However , abolishing the EGFR - AP2 association at this location had no effect on EGFR uptake kinetics at lower levels of receptor expression , even though evidence suggested that endocytosis was still occurring via CME . Intriguingly , the rate of internalization did decrease as the mutant EGFR concentration rose , prompting speculation that multiple factors may be operating in parallel to facilitate CME ( 97 ) . Using a similar approach , the µ2 subunit of AP2 was subsequently identified as the main point of contact with EGFR ( 98 ) . Again though , a presumed dominant negative µ2 that could assemble normally into AP2 complexes , but was incapable of binding EGFR , was found to have minimal impact on EGFR endocytosis ( 98 ) . A secondary AP2 interaction site on the EGFR , consisting of a dileucine motif at residues 1010 / 1011 , has also been deemed non - critical for endocytosis ( 99 ) . Despite the implication that AP2 may be dispensable for EGFR internalization , many ( though not all ) knock - down studies that have examined the consequences of depleting components of the AP2 complex have suggested that it is , in fact , required for CME of the EGFR ( 88 , 100 ) . What , then , could account for the observed experimental inconsistencies and sustained debate ? Collectively , these findings point to the involvement of redundant or collaborating factors that work in parallel to facilitate CME , as well as the existence of pathways that are truly independent of AP2 and clathrin . Notably , one of the more obscure features of Shc proteins is the adaptin binding motif , conserved across ShcA , B , and C , but absent from ShcD ( 26 , 27 ) , that may in fact provide an alternative to the direct interaction of EGFR and AP2 described above . The motif includes a core sequence in the CH1 region , FDMKPF , which is similar to those identified in select transmembrane proteins and deemed responsible for their rapid internalization ( 44 , 101 ) . Aromatic residues in the first and last position are critical to this function ( 101 ) . In a temporal 19 assessment of the ShcA interactome , AP2 was considered a second wave binding partner , associating maximally with the adaptor between 5 and 15 minutes post - EGF stimulation ( 43 ) . Overexpression of wildtype ShcA in cells has been found to marginally enhance both AP2 recruitment to the EGFR , as well as ligand uptake ( 101 ) . Conversely , eliminating the two key aromatic residues via phenylalanine to alanine substitution ( ShcA - FA ) has the opposite - and similarly mild - effect ( 101 ) . Thus , although there is a precedent for ShcA to participate in EGFR endocytosis , the experimental evidence suggests that phenotypic modulation of this path is subtle , and that ShcA FA is not a strong dominant - negative protein capable of derailing a central internalization mechanism . Like the aforementioned studies of the EGFR – AP2 interaction , the biological significance of the association remains unclear . The contributions of Shc proteins to CME have not been further addressed beyond the initial characterization of the AP2 binding motif . Indeed , the individual AP2 subunit responsible for the interaction with ShcA has not been definitively identified , although α - adaptin is used as a proxy indicator of general AP2 engagement ( 101 ) . Nevertheless , the ShcA AP2 binding motif is similar to those of other proteins , including Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor ( LDLR ) ( 101 ) , that have been more extensively scrutinized . Like the EGFR , the LDLR coordinates the µ2 subunit of AP2 , although it has been found to use a distinct binding pocket ( 102 ) , and has also been proposed to recruit other endocytic mediators ( 103 , 104 ) . If this is likewise true of ShcA , it would imply that a parallel and compensatory strategy exists to connect active EGFR to clathrin even in the absence of direct AP2 binding . The physiological consequence of the loss of adaptin binding functionality in ShcD has not yet been investigated , although the full impact of the phenotype may not be evident unless redundant pathways are concurrently ablated . Efforts to elucidate endocytic mechanisms have been further confounded by the influence of ill - defined competing pathways . Although it has long been appreciated that CME is not the only internalization method functioning in the cell , the biochemical nature of this alternative route in the context of EGFR , and the conditions under which it operates , have been challenging to define . The existence of an alternative to CME has been implied by several observations , including the apparent saturability of the relatively fast CME pathway and the concomitant switch to slower kinetics under increasing ligand concentrations , as well as conflicting reports about the effectiveness of clathrin knockdown in preventing EGFR uptake ( 105 - 107 ) . A proposed operational definition of non - clathrin endocytosis ( NCE ) ( also referred to as clathrin - independent endocytosis , or CIE ) suggests that it is characterized by its resistance to 20 clathrin depletion , and sensitivity to pharmacological perturbations of cholesterol ( 108 ) . The latter observation has fuelled speculation that NCE is a type of membrane raft - dependent internalization mechanism , and indeed the involvement of caveolae ( and caveolin - 1 ) has been proposed and disputed ( 88 , 106 , 108 , 109 ) . It has also been suggested that NCE may represent more than one pathway ( 108 ) , and that the response to EGFR activation may be cell - type dependent ( 107 ) and / or determined by context and environment ( 110 , 111 ) . Considering the many variables , and the difficulty in establishing parameters for a given pathway , the extent of uncertainty that continues to surround CME is perhaps not surprising . While the endocytosis debate focuses specifically on the initial events that remove EGFR from the cell surface , understanding the fate decisions that drive the receptor through the endomembrane system to a particular destination has proven equally perplexing . Following ligand - mediated activation of the EGFR , ubiquitin ( Ub ) is one of the first modifications to accumulate on the receptor while it still resides in the plasma membrane ( 71 ) , and its role is thought to be primarily regulatory ( 112 ) . Ubiquitin is a polypeptide that can be covalently conjugated to the lysine residues of a target protein through the concerted activity of E1 , E2 , and E3 proteins , the latter of which engages in substrate recognition ( 113 ) . While monoubiquitylation involves the addition of a single Ub moiety , polyubiquitylation entails sequential addition of the Ub monomers to one of seven lysine residues within ubiquitin itself ( 113 ) . Mass spectrometry has identified 6 motifs in the kinase domain of EGFR that are targets of ubiquitylation ( 71 , 114 ) , however , many additional lysine residues throughout the cytosolic tail have been proposed as cryptic sites of modification ( 100 ) . More than 50 % of the ubiquitin associated with EGFR is in the form of polyubiquitin chains ( 114 ) . The Casitas B - lineage lymphoma ( c - Cbl ) protein has emerged as a key E3 ubiquitin ligase for EGFR , possessing a tyrosine kinase - binding ( TKB ) domain , and a RING Finger domain , which executes the E3 conjugation function ( 115 ) . Through its TKB domain , c - Cbl is recruited to its recognition motif pY1045 on the ligand - activated EGFR , although it can also bind indirectly via Grb2 ( 116 ) . Stimulus - induced , Cbl - mediated ubiquitylation has been found to continue while the receptor is in transit from the plasma membrane . In the early endosome ( EE ) , c - Cbl and its E2 partners , the Ubc4 / 5 family proteins , have been identified in regions that are positive for hepatocyte growth factor - regulated tyrosine kinase substrate ( Hrs ) , which sorts cargo for the multivesicular body ( MVB ) ( 117 ) ( Figure 1 . 2B ) 21 Another longstanding debate in the field centres around the roles and importance of Cbl and ubiquitin in the endocytic process . Although the details have yet to fully crystalize , the general consensus is that receptor ubiquitylation is not required for the initial internalization events that remove EGFR from the surface . Indeed , neither abolishment of the c - Cbl binding motif ( EGFR Y1045F ) ( 118 ) , nor the elimination of 15 lysine residues in the kinase domain ( EGFR 15KR ) impact the uptake kinetics of the receptor , arguing the irrelevance of this modification for early events of endocytosis ( 119 ) . Nevertheless , there is a precedence in the literature for c - Cbl itself to contribute to EGFR internalization , though it appears to be independent of its direct association with the receptor and its conventional sites of polyubiquitylation ( 107 ) . While it may not be required to remove EGFR from the surface , the ubiquitin signature is read by vesicular components , the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport ( ESCRTs ) , that determine ultimate fate ( 113 ) . Included in this group is the aforementioned early endosomal protein Hrs , which is part of the ESCRT - 0 complex and an important first checkpoint for ubiquitinylated cargo ( 120 ) . The EGF receptors that lack ubiquitin and therefore fail to associate with ESCRT machinery are recycled back to the surface , while those that carry the modification , usually in the form of lysine 63 polyubiquitin linkages , are destined for lysosomal degradation ( 114 , 117 , 120 ) . The 15KR mutant EGFR , which internalizes normally , exhibits profoundly impaired down - regulation ( 119 , 120 ) . With its loss of the high affinity c - Cbl binding site , the Y1045F mutation likewise impedes receptor degradation , suggesting that the direct interaction of EGFR and c - Cbl at the outset is ultimately required to conduct the receptor to the lysosome , and further implying a lack of compensatory redundancy in the indirect recruitment of c - Cbl through Grb2 ( 118 ) . Moreover , sustained EGFR kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor’s carboxy terminus appear to be required to maintain ubiquitylation and lysosomal targeting , most likely by preserving the aforementioned Cbl recognition sequence ( 117 ) . Premature inactivation of the intrinsic EGFR kinase reduces the amount of conjugated ubiquitin , and reverses the receptor’s degradative fate ( 117 ) . Although the mechanics of ubiquitin - based receptor sorting are increasingly clear , the events that determine a ubiquitin - lysosome destiny remain an active area of research . One group in particular has pursued the hypothesis that ligand concentration , endocytic method , ubiquitin signatures and receptor fate are intricately intertwined . Evidence supporting this perspective has demonstrated that stimulation with low ligand concentrations , defined as 1 – 2 22 ng / ml in the system under investigation , promotes CME and fails to elicit EGFR ubiquitylation ( 106 ) . This assigns the receptor to a ubiquitin - independent recycling pathway that eventually returns it to the membrane ( 108 ) . At a higher EGF concentration ( equal to and greater than 20 ng / ml ) , EGFR ubiquitylation is pronounced , and the receptor is internalized through caveolin - enriched NCE , which directs its cargo to a degradative fate ( 106 , 108 ) . Under such circumstances , NCE is estimated to account for around 40 % of internalization events , as it occurs in parallel with the non - destructive CME pathway ( 108 ) . The authors further assert , for example , that the c - Cbl binding mutant EGFR Y1045F , which is ubiquitylation - defective , is predominantly recycled through the CME pathway regardless of ligand concentration , while clathrin knockdown has little effect on EGFR degradation , thereby further arguing the functional distinction between CME and NCE and the unique fates of their cargo ( 108 ) . It has been proposed that the etiology of this response lies in a ‘ubiquitin threshold’ that converts graded ligand concentrations into a binary post - translational modification output . This switch appears to operate between 3 and 10 ng / ml EGF , and is characterized by a sharp increase in both c - Cbl binding and EGFR ubiquitylation ( 111 ) . Despite the attractiveness of this holistic and integrative model , criticisms of the proposal include claims that caveolar endocytosis is not involved in EGFR uptake ( 88 , 109 ) , that NCE makes negligible contributions to EGF - stimulated EGFR internalization , and that clathrin knockdown does in fact inhibit degradation ( 110 ) . It remains to be seen whether dissenting perspectives can be reconciled as the systems under scrutiny are subject to increasingly sophisticated analysis . Certainly , the ongoing controversy surrounding the canonical mechanisms of EGFR endocytosis and regulation serves to emphasize the complexity of a process that , fifty years after its discovery , still remains somewhat mysterious . 1 . 2 . 2 Ligand - independent activation of the EGFR Traditionally , EGFR signalling is considered to be a directional , outside - in event initiated by one of the aforementioned compatible ligands , and subject to various layers of governance . Under normal physiological conditions , and in the absence of external stimuli , the EGFR typically adopts an auto - inhibited form that has been compared to inactive Src ( 121 ) . Ligand - induced asymmetric dimerization of apposing kinase domains is believed to relieve the inhibition through the formation of cyclin dependent kinase ( CDK ) / cyclin – like complexes ( 122 ) . This distinctive mechanism highlights the potential for other cellular components or conditions to 23 mimic the characteristics of activation , or otherwise circumvent the auto - inhibitory features that prevent the receptor from spuriously signalling . To date , several strategies have been identified that can induce ligand - free activation , including EGFR overexpression , mutation , companion molecules , and cellular stressors including UV and hydrogen peroxide . Strikingly , the outcomes of these pathways often deviate from canonical EGFR signalling , thereby further diversifying the cellular response repertoire , and / or promoting oncogenic transformation . 1 . 2 . 2 . 1 Overexpression Since the 1980s , EGFR gene amplification and protein overproduction have been regarded as hallmarks of certain cancers ( 123 ) , and the transforming properties of upregulated wildtype EGFR have been demonstrated ( 124 , 125 ) . Considering the number of tissues that are developmentally influenced by the ErbB family and its ligands , it is perhaps not surprising that the majority of solid neoplasms reportedly involve overexpression of one or more of these proteins ( 66 ) . For EGFR in particular , these include tumors of the head and neck , kidney , pancreas , colon , breast , ovary , prostate , bladder , lung , and brain ( 70 ) . Glioblastoma Multiforme ( GBM ) is among those consistently and profoundly affected by alterations to the EGFR signalling platform . As the most common and aggressive brain malignancy in adults , GBM has a poor prognosis even with multimodal intervention ( 126 ) . It is characterized as a grade IV tumour by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , on account of being mitotically overactive , genomically unstable , highly infiltrative and treatment resistant ( 126 ) . Overexpression of the EGFR has been estimated to occur in 40 – 50 % of cases , much of which is driven by gene amplification ( 127 ) . More recently , data from The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) was used to define molecular subtypes of this challenging and intractable malignancy . Of the four profiles identified , the ‘classical’ designation was found to exhibit high - level EGFR gene amplification and corresponding overexpression in a striking 97 % of cases ( 128 ) . However , this subtype was also associated with the most promising response to clinical intervention ( 128 ) . Additional mechanisms beyond gene amplification can promote the cellular dysregulation of EGFR . For example , transcriptional upregulation from a normal copy number EGFR locus is considered a major factor contributing to overexpression ( 129 ) . Likewise , circumstances that alter the fate of the receptor can undermine normal regulatory functions . Subversion of the canonical destruction pathways , such as the Cbl - Ubiquitin axis that routes the EGFR to the lysosome , can extend the receptor half - life and its signalling legacy ( 130 ) . This can 24 occur independently via mutations in the EGFR , c - Cbl , and its interactome , as well as through heterodimerization of wildtype EGFR with its homolog , HER2 , to yield a complex that is poorly ubiquitylated and rapidly recycled ( 130 , 131 ) . Altogether , there is a compelling prognostic and mechanistic precedent for EGFR overexpression in cancer , which remains to be fully harnessed for therapeutic purposes ( 132 ) . Yet , the prevailing assumption is that the upregulated receptor still engages in traditional , ligand - mediated transduction , further sensitizing the cell to growth factors ( 66 , 127 ) . Several lines of evidence corroborate this perspective , dating back to the original transformation experiments that demonstrated the ligand - dependency of the phenotype ( 124 , 125 ) . In a similar vain , upregulation of cognate ligands is often found to occur with receptor overexpression , although this too has been debated ( 69 , 127 , 133 ) . Perhaps the strongest argument in favour of this paradigm has been the failure to establish tumorigenic mouse models from overexpression of wildtype EGFR alone ( 66 ) . Recently , a mouse bearing many hallmarks of human GBM was generated via compound upregulation of EGFR and TGF α , and deletion of the tumour suppressor locus Cdkn2a , as is commonly found in the Classical GBM subtype ( 128 , 133 ) . Importantly , the oncogenic success of this model depended on the presence of ligand ; neither EGFR nor TGF - α alone on the Cdkn2a - null background were capable of gliomagenesis ( 133 ) . Although the mouse models underscore the requirement for concomitant ( over ) expression of receptor and ligand in order to promote the full spectrum of cancer characteristics , they also reveal that EGFR alone is able to increase cellular proliferation ( 66 ) . Yet , the capacity for EGFR to signal in a truly ligand - independent fashion , and the nature of the output from this pathway , have only recently come under scrutiny ( 69 ) . From a structural and mechanistic standpoint , it has been shown that receptor density at the cell surface controls the extent of EGFR activation in a ligand - free system , and that cancer - relevant levels ( around 2 , 000 receptors / µm 2 , as found in some tumours ) promote EGFR phosphorylation rivalling that of exogenous stimuli ( 134 ) . Evidence is only now beginning to reveal a distinct , ligand - independent agenda initiated by EGFR upregulation ( 69 ) . One of the first studies that endeavoured to profile the transcriptional targets of overexpressed EGFR in the presence and absence of ligand yielded two pivotal observations : the EGFR alone could drive upregulation of 93 genes and downregulation of another 55 , and this response was not identical to that of the ligand - induced state or a key oncogenic variant ( 135 ) . Closer inspection of the ligand - free cascade identified important features that distinguish it from canonical signalling . Although EGFR phosphorylation 25 was detected at the three sites assayed ( Y845 , Y1068 , and Y1173 ) , proximal effectors Erk and Akt were not activated ( 136 ) . Moreover , select genes that were robustly induced by wildtype EGFR overexpression were shut off when ligand was administered . This effect was traced to the transcription factor IRF3 , which was found to be transcriptionally upregulated , phosphorylated , and complexed with EGFR under conditions of high receptor density and no ligand . Introducing EGF to this system shifted the EGFR interactome and transcriptional targets , transitioning from EGFR - IRF3 associations to EGFR - Shc complexes . It would appear that the two alternate pathways are not only distinct , but also mutually exclusive . Strikingly , adopting the noncanonical pathway in the absence of exogenous stimuli also altered the cell’s sensitivity to chemotherapy . Temozolomide , which is a non - EGFR specific primary choice drug for GBM , was found to be less effective at inducing cell death under ligand - free conditions ( 136 ) . This suggests that even if wildtype EGFR on its own is not on oncogenic driver , it may modify the cellular response in ways that shape the ultimate disease prognosis . This pivotal study was the first of its kind to characterize the unique ligand - independent gene expression programme initiated by EGFR , and further investigation will be required to fully understand the physiological ramifications . 1 . 2 . 2 . 2 Oncogenic variants of EGFR It stands to reason that any perturbation to the EGFR structure that destabilizes the inactive conformation will have stimulatory effects on the receptor . This principle is found to manifest in cancer , wherein a spectrum of genetic EGFR modifications has been identified in patient samples , and confirmed through mechanistic analysis to impact the catalytic activity of the receptor . These range from single amino acid substitutions to large , multi - exon deletions that remove hundreds of residues , although not all modifications render the receptor constitutively active or ligand - independent ( 66 ) . While it is beyond the scope of this discussion to provide a comprehensive inventory of all oncogenic EGFR mutations , the study of such changes and their impact on protein structure , function , and cellular integration , is a pivotal battle in the war on cancer . One example of a simple activating substitution involves EGFR residue L834 , which lies in the kinase activation loop and has been estimated to account for over 40 % of EGFR mutations detected in lung cancers ( 122 ) . Replacement of this hydrophobic amino acid with a 26 polar moiety ( Leu to Arg ) appears to prevent the EGFR from adopting the aforementioned Src - like closed configuration , thereby activating the kinase ( 122 ) . A more profound genetic alteration is exemplified by EGFR variant III ( EGFRvIII ) , less commonly known as Δ EGFR or de2 - 7 EGFR on account of an in - frame deletion that removes exons 2 to 7 of the extracellular region , generating a truncated receptor that is incapable of binding ligand ( 137 ) . This incarnation of the EGFR has been deemed the most common variant , and is estimated to account for more than 50 % of genomic EGFR alterations in GBM ( 66 ) . EGFRvIII also appears to be more oncogenic than the overexpressed wildtype receptor , as it has demonstrated transforming capacity in vitro and in nude mice ( 138 ) . Of particular relevance to the current discussion , the ligand - free signalling pathways initiated by EGFRvIII are distinct from those of canonical EGFR transduction ( 137 ) . Uniquely , EGFRvIII is constitutively phosphorylated at a low level , and resistant to down regulation ( 139 ) . Cellular transcriptome analyses to detect the consequences of EGFRvIII compared to ligand - treated EGFR have revealed a rather surprising observation . While stimulated , wildtype EGFR facilitated the upregulation of 158 genes and downregulation of 51 , EGFRvIII induced only 14 and suppressed 2 . Moreover , 8 of the 14 activated genes were unique to EGFRvIII , and almost all gene targets of this variant are involved in growth control ( 135 ) . 1 . 2 . 2 . 3 EGFR stress response Beyond EGFR expression level and mutagenesis , there are subtle ways to alter the microenvironment to circumvent the requirement for growth factors . These alternative strategies , considered cellular stressors , include chemical and physical treatments such as the antibiotic anisomycin ( 71 ) , cigarette smoke ( 140 ) , ultraviolet ( UV ) irradiation ( 141 ) , and oxidative stress ( 142 ) . As with the aforementioned non - canonical routes of EGFR activation , regulatory networks and proximal targets of stress - induced EGFR signalling are often distinct from those elicited by classical ligands . A role for EGFR in the cellular UV response was first uncovered several decades ago , by research that endeavoured to identify signalling nodes that were sensitive to irradiation ( 143 ) . Cultured human keratinocyte cells of the epidermis have since become valuable models for the biologically and clinically relevant phenomenon of sunlight exposure , in particular the UVB range of the spectrum ( 280 nm – 320 nm ) , which is most carcinogenic ( 144 ) . In these skin cells , 27 EGFR has been identified as a main hub of UV - mediated signalling ( 145 , 146 ) . Following UV exposure , EGFR can associate with canonical partners including ShcA , Grb2 / SOS , and PLC γ ( 147 ) . Under these conditions , the p52 isoform of ShcA is phosphorylated in an EGFR - dependent manner ( 145 ) . Studies have consistently demonstrated the proximal activation of an alternative MAPK , the SAPK JNK , while the engagement of the classical MAPK , Erk , appears to be somewhat context dependent ( 144 , 146 , 148 - 150 ) . Inactivation of the EGFR in irradiated cells has been shown to drastically reduce survival and increase levels of both apoptosis and necrosis , thereby implicating the wildtype EGFR in resistance to stress - induced death ( 145 ) . One of the earliest studies to report EGFR phosphorylation and signalling complex formation following UV exposure also demonstrated the sensitivity of the response to antioxidants , thereby providing some of the first evidence linking reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) to EGFR signalling ( 147 ) . It has since been definitively shown that UV irradiation generates intracellular hydrogen peroxide , which is a major driver of EGFR activation and the ensuing pathways that characterize the UV response ( 149 , 151 , 152 ) . An intriguing redox mechanism has come to light that helps to account for this far - reaching property of peroxide , while providing more insight into the regulatory strategies that govern EGFR . In addition to the structural features of the receptor that intrinsically protect against spurious auto - activation , companion phosphatases such as RPTP - κ work in parallel to counteract both stimulus - induced and basal state phosphorylation ( 153 ) . Critical to the function of all PTPs is a conserved cysteine residue in the catalytic core , which is sensitive to oxidation ( 154 ) . Reaction of the thiolate anion ( Cys - S - ) with hydrogen peroxide generates a sulfenic acid species ( Cys - SOH ) that eliminates the key nucleophile used in phosphate - group transfer and reversibly incapacitates the enzyme ( 154 ) . This phenomenon has been specifically implicated in the process of UV - and ligand - mediated EGFR activation and signal propagation , through the crippling effects of peroxide on phosphatases including RPTP - κ , PTP1B , SHP2 , and PTEN ( 155 - 157 ) . Emerging evidence also suggests that the EGFR kinase itself has a redox - sensitive cysteine that represents an H 2 O 2 target . Exposure of EGFR to hydrogen peroxide has been found to enhance the catalytic activity of the receptor and induce C797 sulfenylation , suggesting that the receptor is directly oxidized by ROS ( 157 ) . Beyond its contributions to the UV response , hydrogen peroxide has been investigated extensively in its own right , in its capacities as a potent second messenger in EGF - mediated 28 signalling , a chronic factor in cellular oxidative stress , and an environmental chemical in substances such as cigarette smoke ( 140 , 158 ) . These investigations have continued to reveal key differences between canonical transduction and stress - provoked pathways . For example , peroxide - treated EGFR has been found to exhibit a distinct pattern of phosphorylation that appears to be exclusively tyrosine based , and sustained considerably longer than that induced by ligand ( 159 , 160 ) . While phosphorylation of EGFR residues Y845 , Y1068 , and Y1173 were easily detected after 15 minutes of hydrogen peroxide stimulation , Y1045 , the c - Cbl binding motif , was negligibly modified for the full duration of the time course ( 160 ) . Accordingly , a profound deficit was noted in c - Cbl recruitment and resulting EGFR ubiquitylation ( 160 ) . These changes to the PTM code appear to manifest in the overall trajectory and regulation of the EGFR . Consistent with the aforementioned importance of ubiquitin in prescribing receptor degradation ( Chapter 1 . 2 . 1 . 2 ) , EGFR half - life was found to increase upon exposure to peroxide , as compared to untreated controls ( 159 ) . Evidence has since suggested that the H 2 O 2 - stimulated EGFR initially resists endocytosis , but eventually internalizes via a CIE pathway and traffics to an unidentified perinuclear compartment that is not associated with the lysosome ( 142 ) . Overall , important distinctions in signalling output and duration , internalization routes , and receptor fate , set UV / ROS - mediated EGFR cascades apart from traditional ligand - stimulated pathways . The full scope of their impact has yet to be realized . 1 . 3 Beyond EGFR : molecular mechanisms of Shc adaptors In addition to the MAPK cascade , another major cellular hub involving Shc adaptors , particularly ShcA and C , is the PI3K / Akt pathway ( 21 , 24 , 161 ) , although it currently lacks the level of characterization afforded to Shc - MAPK . In particular , the consequences of ShcC proximal to the glial cell line - derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF ) RTK Ret have received attention . In neuronal and thyroid carcinoma cells , ShcC facilitates pro - survival signalling by complexing with the adaptor GAB1 , which can recruit the p85 subunit of PI3K to the receptor upon stimulation , thereby activating this cascade as portrayed in Figure 1 . 3C ( 21 , 24 ) . By contrast , ShcC appears to have little effect on PI3K signalling in neural progenitor cells ( 162 ) , while it represses Akt phosphorylation in lymphocytes ( 163 ) , thereby emphasizing the highly contextual nature of Shc - mediated transduction . 29 Below , we digress from the topic of RTKs to explore additional cellular contributions of the Shc family . Figure 1 . 3 summarizes the major nodes of Shc involvement . 30 Figure 1 . 3 . Diverse molecular contributions of Shc proteins . ( A ) p52 ShcA is best characterized as an adaptor protein proximal to RTKs such as EGFR . ( B ) Like p52 , p66 also interacts with EGFR and Grb2 , however , it exerts an inhibitory effect on the MAPK pathway . ( C ) ShcC is predominantly involved in survival signaling through PI3K / Akt , proximal to the GDNF receptor Ret . As with EGFR , ligand stimulation causes Shc to relocate to the phosphorylated receptor . Both ShcC , and its constitutive binding partner , Gab1 , become phosphorylated upon binding the RTK , prompting an interaction between Gab1 and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3 Kinase ( PI3K ) . The catalytic p110 subunit of PI3K can then phosphorylate membrane phospholipids that recruit the Akt kinase , which is activated by Phosphoinositide - dependent Kinase 1 ( PDK1 ) and PDK2 . Akt itself then phosphorylates several downstream targets that suppress apoptosis . ( D ) Shc can recruit the cytosolic kinase Src to an RTK ; conversely , active Src can phosphorylate Shc . ( E ) Non - catalytic receptors including integrins use indirect methods to recruit Shc . Upon binding extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , select beta subunits are subject to phosphorylation by Src family kinases to generate a Shc binding site . Alternatively , the transmembrane domain of certain alpha subunits interacts with the membrane - spanning adaptor caveolin - 1 . This recruits and activates the Src family kinase Fyn , which phosphorylates Shc and promotes its interaction with Grb2 . ( F ) At focal adhesion contacts with the ECM , p66 ShcA senses and responds to mechanical tension , initiating detachment - mediated apoptosis ( anoikis ) in the absence of sufficient cytoskeletal integrity . ( H ) Upon oxidative challenge , p66 ShcA is phosphorylated at S36 by PKC , and targeted to the mitochondrion via Pin1 - mediated isomerization . In the intermembrane space ( IM ) , p66 oxidizes cytochrome c ( cyt C ) of the electron transport chain , and reduces O 2 to H 2 O 2 to increase mitochondrial permeability and promote apoptosis . ( M : Matrix ) . 1 . 3 . 1 Cytosolic kinase signalling From the infancy of Shc characterization , the role of cytosolic enzymes in regulating these adaptors has been sought . The Src family Kinases ( SFK ) constitute a collection of proto - oncogenic , nonreceptor tyrosine kinases implicated in a variety of cellular phenomena ( 164 ) . The founding member of the family , v - Src , was initially identified as the transforming factor in Rous sarcoma virus , and later revealed to have a cellular counterpart , c - Src , that could likewise 31 contribute to malignancy when deregulated ( 164 ) . SFKs are also important proximal components in RTK - mediated signalling events ( 165 ) . In cells transformed by v - Src , all isoforms of ShcA are found to be highly phosphorylated ( 166 ) . Interestingly , v - Src phosphorylates ShcA at both Y239 / 240 and Y317 , while c - Src targets only Y239 / 240 and depends on engagement of the Shc PTB domain with phosphatidylinositols ( 167 - 169 ) . Activation of these sites by SFKs likely primes Shc to engage downstream effectors in an analogous fashion to receptor - mediated signalling ( Figure 1 . 3D ) . Additionally , SFK regulation of Shc proximal to RTK stimulation may constitute a parallel pathway of Shc involvement in growth factor transduction . To that end , aforementioned studies of receptor - adaptor dynamics that demonstrate ligand - induced ShcA phosphorylation in the absence of Shc binding sites in the EGFR cytoplasmic tail have been perplexing ( 80 , 81 ) . However , the deletions and targeted mutations employed in these investigations failed to account for EGFR residues Y974 and Y845 , sites of Src binding and phosphorylation , respectively ( 170 , 171 ) . Furthermore , the EGFR - Src interaction is ligand dependent , and known to enhance Shc phosphorylation ( 171 ) . We therefore propose that EGF - mediated Shc signalling that occurs independent of a direct interaction between EGFR and the adaptor is in fact orchestrated by a SFK , which could localize to the receptor and subsequently activate ShcA . Conversely , ShcA overexpression has been found to enhance the ligand - dependent association between EGFR and c - Src , as well as upregulate Src enzyme activity ( 53 ) . Both p66 and p52 directly bind and activate c - Src even in the absence of RTKs , via a non - canonical Shc interface ( 172 ) . The consequence of the association appears to involve Stat phosphorylation and nuclear translocation , as well as induction of proteins including p21 / WAF1 / Cip1 ( 172 ) . 1 . 3 . 2 Signalling through non - catalytic receptors The Shc adaptors are also involved in transducing signals downstream of transmembrane proteins that lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity , such as integrins and antigen receptors of T and B lymphocytes . Often the signals converge on the common Ras / MAPK pathway already discussed , although mounting evidence also highlights the existence of novel Shc functions . Regardless of their origin , non - catalytic receptors require accessory kinases to initiate phosphotyrosine - mediated recruitment of signalling components . This is exemplified by the T cell receptor ( TCR ) , a multimeric complex involved in recognition of processed antigen . Upon 32 engagement of the epitope - binding dimer , the associated CD3 signal transduction subunits are phosphorylated by the SFK Lck , on conserved immune - receptor tyrosine - based activation motifs ( ITAMs ) . This is followed by recruitment of a second kinase , ZAP - 70 ( 173 ) . As reviewed by Finetti et al . , the SH2 domain of p52 ShcA binds phospho - CD3 , while ZAP - 70 engages the PTB domain and can also phosphorylate the adaptor , in addition to Lck . In the case of p52 , this can activate Ras / MAPK and Rac pathways , potentially influencing T cell activation , survival , and cytoskeletal dynamics ( 174 ) . Similar mechanisms exist to couple p52 to the B cell receptor ( BCR ) . Conversely , both p66 ShcA and ShcC are considered negative regulators of TCR and BCR signalling , reducing the receptors’ sensitivity to antigen and increasing levels of apoptosis ( 163 , 174 ) . Accordingly , loss of these antagonists triggers autoimmune phenotypes characterized by hyperactive cells and self - reactive antibodies ( 174 ) . In non - hematopoietic cells , proteinaceous extracellular matrix ( ECM ) represents both a substratum for attachment as well as a source of information and stimuli for the cell . Accordingly , non - catalytic , heterodimeric integrin receptors provide vital mechanical and chemical links between the ECM of the surroundings and the cytoskeletal and signalling networks of the cell interior , thereby influencing processes such as migration , proliferation , and apoptosis ( 175 ) . A subset of integrin receptors are capable of transducing signals through the ShcA adaptor protein , including those for laminin ( α 6 β 4 ) ( 176 , 177 ) , collagen ( α 2 β 1 ) ( 178 ) , collagen / laminin ( α 1 β 1 ) , fibronectin ( α 5 β 1 ) ( 179 ) as well as the promiscuous receptor that can engage vitronectin ( α v β 3 ) ( 178 , 179 ) . Several mechanisms have been proposed to connect Shc adaptors to active integrins and transduce ‘outside - in’ signals ( Figure 1 . 3E ) . In one strategy , intracellular kinases phosphorylate integrins directly to generate consensus Shc recognition motifs . This is the case with the laminin - binding α 6 β 4 integrin , which sustains phosphorylation on its β 4 subunit upon ligation and subsequently recruits Shc , via its PTB and SH2 domains , to signal through the MAPK pathway ( 176 , 177 ) . β 3 integrin is also inducibly phosphorylated and becomes a direct target for Shc ( 180 ) . However , not all beta subunits are subject to phosphorylation . In an indirect binding model , Shc recruitment occurs independent of the integrin cytoplasmic tail and any tyrosine motifs located therein . Instead , ligand engagement by select integrins stimulates the transmembrane region of the alpha subunit to interact with the membrane - spanning adaptor caveolin - 1 , which constitutively binds the SFK Fyn ( 179 , 181 ) . Alternatively , Yes , Lck , or Lyn may substitute for Fyn ( 182 ) . Activation of the kinase and its subsequent SH3 - domain mediated association with 33 ShcA facilitate Shc phosphorylation at residue Tyr - 317 , recruitment of Grb2 , and initiation of the Ras / MAPK cascade that can lead to cell proliferation ( 179 , 181 ) . Owing to their promiscuity , Shc proteins can integrate simultaneous stimuli from multiple sources , such as growth factors and ECM , to tailor the cellular response . In one experimental system , ShcA was found to promote integrin - mediated haptotaxis in the absence of growth factors , by a PTB domain - dependent mechanism . Upon addition of EGF , migration proceeded independently of Shc , while proliferation required the Shc SH2 domain ( 178 ) . Postnatal angiogenesis also appears to require the integrative powers of ShcA to assimilate signals from the VEGF and integrin receptors , invoking a cell survival response upon engagement with a compatible ECM substrate and growth factor ( 183 ) . Recent developments also implicate p66 ShcA in anoikis , the apoptotic program initiated when adherent cells detach from the matrix ( Figure 1 . 3F ) . Intriguingly though , this function is distinct from the role of p66 in oxidative stress - induced apoptosis , and instead relies on recruitment of the adaptor to focal adhesions , the integrin - based mechanosensory structures that anchor the cell to ECM ( 184 ) . Here , p66 is speculated to infer the attachment status of the cell based upon tension in cytoskeletal stress fibers radiating from the foci . Loss of mechanical integrity triggers p66 to activate the GTPase RhoA , which initiates anoikis . Although the precise mechanism remains unclear , it appears to require the intact p66 PTB domain , and involve release of Ras - mediated repression of RhoA ( Figure 1 . 3F ) ( 184 , 185 ) . In attached cells , or those lacking p66 , the pro - apoptotic behaviours of RhoA are inhibited . 1 . 4 Physiological contributions of Shc proteins The functional importance and non - redundancy of Shc proteins are best revealed by their diverse and unique contributions to animal development . From embryonic lethality to prolonged life span , the consequences of Shc genetic perturbations are vast and far - reaching . They are also incompletely characterized , as the effects of genomic ShcD ablation are not yet known . With such broad involvement in fundamental signalling pathways , metabolism , and morphogenesis , Shc proteins are also increasingly implicated in a spectrum of disorders that 34 arise from cellular dysregulation . Cancer investigations have generated the most extensive insights into the pathological manifestations of Shc adaptors . . From the time of its discovery , ShcA has been considered a proto - oncogene in light of its capacity to transform cells ( 6 ) , while ShcD was first characterized as a mediator of melanoma metastasis ( 27 ) . Collectively , members of the Shc family have been associated anecdotally , prognostically , and / or mechanistically with a variety of cancers including those of the brain ( 162 ) , thyroid ( 186 ) kidney ( 59 ) , colon ( 187 ) , breast ( 188 ) , prostate ( Section 6 . 3 . 1 ) , and neuroblastoma ( Section 1 . 4 . 3 , below ) . 1 . 4 . 1 Oxidative stress and lifespan Arguably the most divergent of the Shc protein functions identified to date is its role in oxidative stress and programmed cell death ( PCD ) . The oxidoreductase activity of p66 ShcA remains a pivotal juxtaposition to canonical Shc signalling , and an intensive area of investigation . The first indication of the adaptor’s unprecedented function arose from a landmark study that selectively removed the p66 isoform of ShcA in mice , leaving p52 and p46 intact ( 9 ) . Surprisingly , the genetic ablation extended rodent lifespan by 30 % , and conferred resistance to oxidative stress at both the organismal and cellular level . By comparison , the compound ablation of all three ShcA isoforms is embryonic lethal , and knockout ( KO ) mice succumb to gross cardiovascular dysfunction by day 11 . 5 of gestation ( 13 ) . Residue S36 in the CH2 region was identified as a critical component of the p66 - mediated apoptotic response to oxidative challenge , as phosphorylation of this residue is required to trigger cell death upon exposure to UV or H 2 O 2 ( 9 ) . Models have since emerged that portray p66 ShcA as both a sensor and a proponent of ROS , and position it in an intricate network of cell fate decisions . It appears that the initial oxidative stimulus can be conveyed to ShcA via PKC β , which phosphorylates S36 of p66 ( 50 ) . Phospho - S36 / P37 then becomes a consensus recognition site for the prolyl isomerase Pin1 , which induces cis - trans isomerization around this bond and targets p66 for mitochondrial uptake ( 50 ) . A further level of regulation may be achieved by context - dependent oligomerization of p66 . The isolated CH1 region seems to exist as a non - covalent dimer that is incapable of eliciting apoptosis . However , under oxidizing conditions when redox scavengers are saturated , the dimer tetramerizes via disulfide bridging of conserved Cysteine - 59 residues , and primes the protein to initiate PCD ( 45 ) . Strikingly , the translocated , activated p66 situates in the 35 mitochondrial intermembrane space , from which it can interact with cyt c of the electron transport chain and engage in redox exchanges that provoke apoptosis ( 46 ) . Contained within the CB motif of the CH1 region are three critical residues , 132 - EEW - 134 , that constitute the redox centre of p66 . This core facilitates the binding and oxidation of cyt c , and serves to transfer electrons to molecular oxygen to generate H 2 O 2 . In turn , this ROS increases inner mitochondrial membrane permeability causing the organelle to swell , rupture , and release pro - apoptotic factors into the cytosol ( 46 ) ( Figure 1 . 3G ) . Not surprisingly , p66 has been implicated in a number of disorders with metabolic and inflammatory characteristics that can be prevented by selective ablation of the protein in murine models . As revealed recently however , p66 deletion is only advantageous under certain controlled circumstances . In a natural wild environment , p66 - null mice fail to thrive and are found to have reduced fertility and intolerance to cold and starvation , owing to deficits in adipogenesis and glucose homeostasis ( 189 ) . The collective p66 body of work briefly highlighted here underscores the complexity of cellular regulatory systems , and the diverse and dynamic functionality of ShcA . 1 . 4 . 2 Nervous system development Genetic models and in vitro analyses have fostered a vision of the dynamic interplay between ShcA , B , and C proteins over the course of nervous system development and into adulthood . Contrary to its generalized expression elsewhere in the body , ShcA is highly restricted and tightly regulated in the brain . During gestation and beyond , its expression is confined to areas of active neuroblast proliferation , while post - mitotic cells show marked reduction of the protein coincident with cellular differentiation ( 15 ) . Accordingly , it has been reported that the initial process of neural induction from embryonic stem ( ES ) cells is characterized by up - regulation of p66 ShcA ( 190 ) . In support of this observation , experimentally - induced overexpression of p66 in cultured ES cells exposed to neuralizing conditions accelerates the loss of pluripotency and acquisition of neural markers , such as nestin , as occurs very early in the commitment process ( 190 ) . The contributions of ShcA proteins to neurogenesis from this point forward have been analyzed by tissue - specific deletion or mutation in mice . McFarland et al . reported that animals presented with considerable microcephaly when ShcA was excised under control of the nestin promoter , thereby implicating ShcA in survival 36 mechanisms of this precursor population . Strikingly , a similar phenotype results from conditional expression of a phosphorylation - defective dominant negative adaptor ( ShcFFF ) that lacks the central CH1 pTyr residues that serve as Grb2 consensus sequences . Its detrimental consequences have been attributed to neural progenitor apoptosis ( 191 ) . Although brain weights of nestin - induced ShcFFF mice were reduced to 50 % of control values for the lifetime of the animals , the period of enhanced apoptosis that gave rise to microcephaly was limited to a narrow developmental window ( 191 ) . While ShcA expression is initially high and progressively decreases with developmental stage ( 15 ) , ShcC is absent early in embryogenesis and is strongly up - regulated prior to birth ( 19 ) , at which point it is detected in quiescent neurons ( 192 ) . Expression continues to escalate postnatally for 6 to 8 weeks in mice ( 19 ) . Indeed , ShcA and C display a pattern of reciprocal expression in pre - and post - mitotic neuronal cells that has been postulated as a molecular commitment switch , wherein ShcA down - regulation and ShcC induction demarcate the transition between cellular proliferation and differentiation ( 192 ) . This orchestration is consistent with the findings that ShcA is required to maintain neuronal precursors ( 191 ) , while ShcC prevents apoptosis and promotes neuronal maturation , as gauged by morphological changes when the adaptor is overexpressed in primary neuronal cultures ( 192 ) . The survival influence of ShcC depends on its SH2 domain , and involves sustained phosphorylation of Akt and inhibition of the pro - apoptotic protein Bad , both of which are consequences of the PI3K cascade . Meanwhile , the adaptor’s contribution to differentiation is linked to prolonged Erk1 / 2 activation ( 192 ) . Both PI3K pathway augmentation and delayed , persistent MAPK signalling are facilitated by ShcC proximal to the GDNF receptor Ret ( 21 ) . Although a consensus has yet to be reached regarding the biochemical changes that drive and accompany the shift in Shc expression , these findings suggest that the molecular basis of the transition may lie in the divergent signalling properties of the two adaptors . Despite the appeal of the ShcA / ShcC developmental switch model , however , initial data from the genetic ShcC KO mouse did not appear to support a fundamental role for this adaptor in establishing and maintaining post - mitotic neurons . Curiously , ShcC KO animals are viable and display no overt morphological abnormalities ( 19 ) . The possibility that ShcB , which likewise demonstrates a modest increase in central nervous system ( CNS ) expression near the end of gestation , performs compensatory functions in the absence of ShcC , was also tested . Double KO mice carrying global compound ShcB and C ablation are viable and neuroanatomically 37 normal in the CNS , though they exhibit reduced numbers of sympathetic neurons in the superior cervical ganglia that cannot be recapitulated by singular ablation of ShcB or ShcC ( 19 ) . Loss occurs late in development , consistent with the hypothesis that ShcB / C support post - mitotic neurons . Both the ShcB and ShcB / ShcC KOs also lose discrete populations of sensory neurons from the dorsal root ganglia , although the animals retain sensory function . Evidently , the KO phenotypes are less severe than anticipated under a model that implicates ShcC as a critical factor in post - mitotic neuron survival . Sakai and colleagues surmised that ShcB and C are not exclusive mediators of RTK signalling in neurons , but instead participate in only a subset of cellular responses ( 19 ) . To that end , ShcD has recently been detected in post - mitotic embryonic neurons , and is known to associate with neuronal RTKs including TrkB , as well as components of the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction , most notably MuSK ( 26 , 193 ) , although its role in these contexts are not fully understood ( 28 ) . . The consequences of ShcD KO , and indeed compound removal of ShcB , ShcC , and ShcD from the nervous system , are highly anticipated . It remains to be seen whether this uncharacterized protein will shed more light on the role of the Shc adaptor switch in neurogenesis . 1 . 4 . 3 Neuroblastoma Perhaps nowhere is the phenomenon of Shc competition better illustrated than in the study of neuroblastoma , the most common and fatal childhood tumour that develops from sympathetic nervous system precursor cells , and often presents paraspinally in the abdomen or chest ( 194 ) . Intriguingly , it is capable of spontaneous regression in patients under one year of age , and accumulating evidence implicates Shc proteins in cellular fate decisions . In addition to classical prognostic markers , ShcC overexpression has been found to predict poor clinical outcome ( 195 , 196 ) . The profiling of mRNAs of ShcA , B and C in patient tumours revealed ubiquitous ShcA expression across all samples , although levels were more robust in lower - grade tumours , while ShcB was minimal and mostly limited to earlier stage cancers . In contrast , ShcC expression was low in early stages of the disease , and markedly elevated in advanced tumours , rendering it a strong indicator of neuroblastoma progression ( 195 ) . This trend in ShcA / ShcC gene expression was independently confirmed by examining the respective proteins ( 196 ) . From the perspective of oncogenic mechanism , cultured neuroblastoma cell lines have been used to investigate the molecular determinants of the disease . Phosphorylated ShcC is 38 evident in a number of lines , particularly those in which it associates with the constitutively active Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase ( ALK ) and becomes a substrate for this enzyme ( 197 ) . Notably , ShcA has also been detected in most of the neuroblastoma cell lines tested , although its phosphorylation pattern is reciprocal to that of ShcC ( 197 ) . Analysis of neuroblastoma patient tissue likewise revealed that more advanced tumours were associated with elevated ShcC phosphorylation ( 197 ) . The molecular relevance of ShcC posttranslational modification was further investigated in cell lines expressing high levels of ALK , by introducing a ShcC mutant devoid of conserved CH1 - region tyrosine residues . This was found to reduce activation of Erk1 / 2 and Akt , while impairing cellular motility , differentiation , and survival ( 198 ) . Most compelling , however , are the consequences of abrogating Shc expression entirely . While RNAi - mediated knockdown of ShcA impedes cellular growth rate , ShcC attenuation reduces in vivo tumorigenicity and promotes the appearance of neurite extensions and markers of cellular differentiation ( 196 ) . Strikingly , neuronal maturation observed in the absence of ShcC has been attributed to ShcA through its sustained activation of Erk1 / 2 . ShcA phosphorylation is accordingly reduced in the presence of ShcC , and restored in its absence ( 196 ) . This supports an hypothesis that the Shc adaptors have competing roles in neuroblastoma , and implies that ShcC may participate in aggressive phenotypes by maintaining cells in an undifferentiated state . The molecular processes by which it accomplishes this and impedes ShcA have not yet been elucidated . Paradoxically , this model directly opposes the putative mechanism of neuronal maturation during development , in which ShcC upregulation is regarded as the switch from proliferation to differentiation . It is nevertheless consistent with recent findings that ShcC is active in neurogenic regions of the adult brain , where it promotes cell migration . Accordingly , ShcC is also believed to endow GBM cancer stem cells with their infiltrative capacity ( 162 ) . The adaptor is consistently overrepresented in the stem / progenitor sub - population of GBM cells , regardless of its relative level in the tumour as a whole . ShcC silencing reduces the invasive properties and overall tumorigenicity of GBM - initiating cells . Intriguingly however , the migratory influence of ShcC in GBM does not involve the Wnt / β - catenin pathway as it does in normal neuroblasts . Instead , the targets of ShcC appear more variable in the context of GBM ( 162 ) . Collectively , these discoveries emphasize the importance of temporal and environmental factors in defining the outcome of Shc signalling . They likewise illustrate that cellular diversity in heterogeneous tumours can be a crucial determinant of disease progression . 39 1 . 5 Rationale and thesis objectives At the outset of the investigations described herein , only two publications documented the existence of ShcD . They described a protein that was very similar to its well - characterized homologs , with the exception of certain distinctions : ShcD had an extended CH2 region , loss of the structural determinants of the PH portion of the PTB domain , three additional , inducible tyrosine residues in the CH1 regions , of which one was a confirmed Grb2 binding site , and loss of the AP2 adaptor motif ( 26 , 27 ) . Considering the complex Shc interactome discussed in preceding sections , each permutation of the basic Shc architecture has the potential to alter the signalling properties of the molecule , thus prompting us to characterize the signaling contributions of this unknown adaptor . As ShcD had also been identified as a mechanistic determinant in melanoma metastasis ( 27 ) there was additional incentive to better understand this novel proto - oncogene , in the hope of eventually intercepting its aberrant behaviour . EGFR was selected as a model RTK , owing to the wealth of existing knowledge on the subject , and the fact that it had already been demonstrated as a putative binding partner in a high - throughput screen ( 199 ) . We thus sought to confirm that finding , and determine a role for ShcD in this context . The intention was to build outward from the interaction profile to identify the unique characteristics that distinguish ShcD in the cell , and ultimately , the organism . To that end , the results of these endeavors are spread across three chapters , the first of which identifies ShcD as a proponent of non - canonical EGFR signalling , while the second characterizes the cellular impact . The third chapter , which is preliminary and speculative , attempts to reconcile these findings and integrate them into a model . 40 1 . 6 Author contributions Elements of Chapters 1 are excerpted from the following review , written and illustrated by M .

It should be regarded as exploratory work . 41 CHAPTER 2 : MATERIALS AND METHODS 42 2 . 1 Plasmids Previously , cDNA encoding full - length wildtype human ShcD ( BC033907 ) as well as point - mutated and truncated versions of the protein were introduced to the pcDNA3 vector ( Invitrogen ) with a triple , carboxy - terminal FLAG epitope ( 26 ) . These constructs , including ShcD PTB * ( R315Q ) , SH2 * ( R548K ) and Y6F ( Y374F ; Y375F ; Y403F ; Y413F ; Y424F , Y465F ) ( 26 ) , were subcloned into the pEGFP C2 vector ( Clontech ) to generate amino - terminally tagged GFP - ShcD . Isolated PTB and SH2 domains ( residues 180 to 351 , and 524 to 603 , respectively ) had previously been cloned into pGEX - 4T - 1 to generate glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fused proteins ( 26 ) . To construct ShcD containing wildtype or mutated ShcA AP2 binding motifs , a 17 amino acid sequence spanning the wildtype ShcA AD motif ( SAPRDLFDMKPFEDALR ) or FA mutation ( SAPRDLADMKPAEDALR ) was used to replace the analogous region in ShcD . Site - directed mutagenesis was used to introduce substitutions into WT ShcD ( FLAG x3 , GFP ) in pEGFP C2 to generate S55A and C84S ShcD . Briefly , around - the - world PCR was performed with mutagenic primers . PCR product was digested with DpnI and transformed into competent cells , miniprepped , and sequenced at the Advanced Analysis Centre , University of Guelph . Untagged EGFR in the pcDNA3 . 1 Zeo ( + ) vector was a gift from Dr . Aaron Gajadhar , Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Human RPTP - κ with a single FLAG tag was provided by Dr . Nicole St .

PP2 SFK Inhibitor ( Tocris Biosciences ) was dissolved in DMSO to a working concentration of 10 mM . Colcemid ( Gibco ) was a gift from the lab of Dr . W . Allan King , University of Guelph . Hydrogen peroxide , Pyrrolidine Dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , and Butylated Hydroxyanisole ( BHA ) were all acquired from Sigma - Aldrich .

Horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti - mouse and goat anti - rabbit secondary antibodies ( Biorad ) were used for immunoblot detection , while goat anti - mouse or goat anti - rabbit Alexa - Fluor 594 ( Invitrogen ) were employed for immunostaining . 2 . 3 Cell culture , transfection , stimulation and inhibition COS - 1 cells were maintained at 37ºC , 5 % CO 2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( P / S ) . In preparation for lysis and protein recovery , cells were grown in 100 - mm x 20 - mm cell culture dishes with 10 mL media ; for immunofluorescent analysis they were seeded on sterile glass coverslips in 35 - mm wells with 2 mL media . Plasmid transfection was performed approximately 24 hours after cell passaging by introducing 2 . 5 or 5 µ g of vector DNA in 5 or 25 µ L polyethyleneimine ( PEI ) and 250 or 750 µ L FBS - free medium to 35 mm and 100 mm plates , respectively . Cells were left for a minimum of 24 hrs before being primed for treatment . At 15 to 18 hrs prior to EGF stimulation , media was removed from cells and replaced with serum - free DMEM containing 1 % P / S . EGF was diluted in fresh DMEM to a final concentration of 50 ng / mL , and applied to cells . 100 mm dishes for protein analysis were 44 incubated directly at 37 ºC for the indicated time interval . Glass slides were pulsed with EGF at 4ºC for 30 min , washed once with 1x Phosphate Buffered Saline ( PBS ) , and chased at 37 ºC in fresh DMEM prior to fixation . Kinase inhibitors were likewise applied following overnight serum starvation . For the purposes of system validation , non - tranfected cells were simultaneously exposed to 1 µM AG 1478 ( or DMSO ) and 50 ng / ml EGF for 30 min prior to lysis . ShcD transfected populations were treated with 1 µM AG 1478 in the absence of EGF and lysed at specific time points for immunoblot analysis . Immunocytochemistry samples were incubated with the inhibitor for 30 to 60 min prior to fixation and staining . Transfected , unstimulated cells were incubated with 10 µM PP2 for 90 min prior to lysis . Non - transfected counterparts were pre - incubated with PP2 for 30 min , and treated with 10 ng / ml EGF for an additional 10 min . Colcemid challenge was executed as described by ( 200 ) . Briefly , cells were treated with 0 . 5 µg / ml colcemid for 1 hour , rinsed , replaced in medium , and fixed at various time points during recovery . Oxidative stress was modeled through direct incubation of cells with exogenous H 2 O 2 at a final concentration of 0 . 2 – 2 . 0 mM , diluted in DMEM . Antioxidant testing was performed by pre - incubating cells with the desired compound ( 50 µM – 400 µM ) for 30 mins at 37 ºC prior to the addition of hydrogen peroxide ( 30 min , 37 ºC ) . The resulting cellular lysates were evaluated for H 2 O 2 - induced EGFR phosphorylation . 2 . 4 Cell lysis , immunoprecipitation , GST pull - down , peptide mapping Immediately following stimulation , cells were placed on ice and washed once with cold 1x PBS , then lysed in 200 - 300 µ L PLC buffer ( 50 mM HEPES [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate , 100 mM sodium fluoride ) freshly supplemented with protease inhibitors ( 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 10 µ g / mL aprotinin , and 10 µ g / mL leupeptin ) to generate “PLC Plus / + ” buffer , and centrifuged for 10 min at 13 , 000 rpm and 4 ºC to recover the cleared supernatant . 45 To immunoprecipitate select proteins , fractions of total lysate ( 150 - 200 µ L ) were nutated overnight at 4 ºC in an 800 - µ L volume of primary antibody , 10 % anti - mouse bead - conjugated secondary antibody ( 100 µ L ) , and PLC plus buffer . Alternatively , GST - fused bait proteins ( ShcD PTB and SH2 domains , ShcA PTB domain ) were purified from BL21 E . coli cells and incubated with whole cell lysate , as described for immunoprecipitation . The IPs were centrifuged for 1 - 2 min at 3 , 000 rpm to pellet beads , and aspirated to remove supernatant . Three rounds of washing with 500 µ L PLC buffer , centrifugation , and aspiration were performed . Complete removal of supernatant from pellet was achieved following the final wash . 20 µ L of 2x SDS protein sample buffer was added to the bead pellet and incubated at 100ºC for 5 to 10 min , immediately prior to gel loading . Peptide mapping in Chapter 3 was performed by incubating purified ShcD and ShcA GST - fusion proteins with synthetic , biotinylated EGFR peptides corresponding to NPXY motifs . 5 µ g of each GST - fusion protein was combined with 10 µ L of the 10 mM peptide preparation , in 750 µ L PLC + and 30 µL of 50 % streptavidin agarose beads , then processed and analyzed as for immunoprecipitation . To confirm interaction between the isolated ShcA AD region and adaptin proteins ( Chapter 4 ) , peptide binding was performed by incubating 5 µ g of biotinylated AD peptide with cleared cell lysates for 2 hrs at 4ºC , then processed and analyzed as for immunoprecipitation . Peptides were generated on an AbiMed 431 synthesizer using standard Fastmoc techniques , with an amino - terminal biotin group to facilitate recovery on streptavidin - conjugated agarose beads ( Pierce ) . Products were confirmed by mass spectrometric and amino acid analysis . 2 . 5 Immunoblotting Whole Cell Lysates ( WCL ) were prepared for electrophoresis by combining them 1 : 1 with 2xSDS buffer , and boiling at 100 ºC for 5 to 10 min . All IP and WCL samples were electrophoresed on 8 % to 10 % SDS - polyacrylamide gels , and transferred to PVDF membranes ( Millipore ) using a semi - dry transfer unit ( BioRad ) . Membranes were blocked in 5 % BSA in Tris - Buffered Saline Tween - 20 ( TBST ) for at least one hour prior to antibody incubation . Blots were washed 3 times for 8 - 10 min each in TBST 46 following treatment with primary ( 16 to 72 hrs , 4 ºC with nutation ) and secondary ( 1 hr , room temperature , with rocking ) antibodies , and visualized with ECL chemiluminescent detection reagent ( Thermo Scientific ) and film . 2 . 6 Apoptosis detection The relative abundance of cleaved Poly ( ADP ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) in both suspension and adherent cells following overnight serum starvation was assessed . Cells suspended in the growth medium were collected by centrifugation at 1100 rpm for 5 min . The pellet was washed in 1x PBS , re - centrifuged , and lysed in parallel with adherent cells for immunoblotting . 2 . 7 Immunofluorescent staining At indicated time points pre - or post - stimulation , glass coverslips were removed from media , washed twice in 1 mL 1x PBS , and fixed for 10 min in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS . Cells were then permeabilized ( 0 . 02 % Triton X - 100 in PBS , 5 min ) , rinsed in PBS , blocked in PBS containing 5 % BSA for 1 hr with gentle rocking , PBS - washed , incubated for 1 hr with primary antibody , rinsed with PBS , incubated in a sealed , light - impermeable chamber with secondary antibody , rinsed with PBS and mounted on glass slides with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI ( Invitrogen ) . All PBS rinses were performed 3 times with 1 mL / well PBS , unless otherwise noted . 2 . 9 Confocal microscopy Samples were imaged at 40x or 63x magnification on the Leica DM6000 multiphoton confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a TSC SP5 scanner , at a resolution of 1024x1024 DPI , and a pinhole of Airy 1 . Cells were scanned sequentially with the 405 diode , Argon 488 , and HeNe 594 lasers to avoid channel bleed through , and emission data were collected a minimum of 20nm from the excitation wavelength to eliminate laser reflection . Images were colourized and composited in ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Heath ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) , and assembled using Adobe Photoshop CS5 . 47 2 . 10 Live cell imaging Cells destined for live analysis were seeded in 6 - well dishes on # 1 . 5 - 25 mm glass coverslips ( Warner Instruments CT , U . S . A . ) and were transferred to a Chamlide CMB magnetic culture chamber ( Quorum Technologies , Guelph , ON ) . Cultures were grown in phenol - free DMEM high - glucose media , supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin at 37°C / 5 % CO 2 . Cells were imaged using a Leica DMRIE2 microscope . Images were acquired at 10 s intervals and , following acquisition ; images were processed and analyzed using standard routines written for NIH ImageJ software . 2 . 11 Photomicrograph analysis Several ImageJ microscopy plugins were used to quantify the extent of colocalized signal in the green and red channels . Mander’s co - localization analyses ( 201 ) were performed on representative images and depicted graphically by plotting individual pixel intensities of each channel on the x and y axes . A van Steensel x - translation was used to generate comparisons between the observed pEGFR distribution pattern , and a scrambled ShcD signal displaced in the abscissa ( 202 ) . Pearson’s correlation coefficients ( Rr ) were calculated for the original overlaid signals , and at various degrees of translation . Quantitatively , correlation is considered significant when the Pearson’s coefficient generated from the actual observations [ Rr ( Obs ) ] exceeds the coefficient produced from multiple , randomized green - channel images [ Rr ( Rand ) ] at least 95 % of the time . 41 x - translation iterations were performed . The 3D Surface Plots were generated using an ImageJ microscopy plugin to depict the gamma intensity profile of the red channel . Squares were drawn 233 pixels wide and centred around a ShcD - AD cell and a non - transfected cell . 2 . 12 Wound healing assay Cells were seeded at high density in 35mm wells prior to the introduction of plasmid DNA . At 24 hrs post - transfection , fresh complete media was applied overnight . Cells were then incubated in serum - free media supplemented with DMSO ( vehicle ) or AG 1478 for 6 hrs before a scratch was inflicted on the monolayer using a p10 pipette tip . Wells were rinsed with PBS to remove debris , and fresh media containing vehicle or inhibitor was added prior to acquiring T = 0 , 48 T = 18 , and T = 48 hr images on a Leica DMIRE2 using Volocity Software ( v 5 . 3 . 2 ) . Four technical replicates were captured per well and matched across time points using a pre - marked plate grid . Replicates were omitted from further analysis if the cellular monolayer surrounding the scratch was not confluent at T = 0 . Three biological replicates were conducted per sample . Wound closure was assessed using TScratch software ( 203 ) and expressed as the change in area ( Δ area = open image area initial – open image area final ) . Using Graph Pad Prism ( v 5 . 0d ) , one - way ANOVA was performed on the averages of technical replicates , followed by Bonferroni’s Multiple Comparison test . 2 . 13 Fluorescence immunohistochemistry Paraffin embedded tissue sections matched to snap - frozen tumor samples were provided by The Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada Brain Tumour Tissue Bank . Staining was performed according to antibody manufacturer’s recommendations ( Cell Signaling Technologies ) . Briefly , the sections were rehydrated in xylene , 100 % EtOH , and 95 % EtOH , and antigen was retrieved using a 1 mM EDTA buffer ( pH 8 . 0 ) at 90°C for 15 min ( 204 ) . Samples were blocked for 60 min at room temperature , and incubated overnight with anti - pEGFR and anti - tubulin sera . Goat - anti - rabbit Alexa fluor 488 and goat - anti - mouse 594 Alexa fluor conjugated secondary antibodies were applied for 60 min , and the slides were mounted using ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI ( Invitrogen ) and imaged on the confocal microscope . 2 . 14 Mass spectrometry sample preparation and data analysis The pcDNA3 ( control vector ) and pcDNA . EGFR - FLAG ( 205 ) or ShcD and pcDNA . EGFR - FLAG DNA constructs were cotransfected into HEK - 293 cells . The FLAG tagged EGFR proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti - flag beads , eluted with 0 . 15 % trifluoroacetic acid and digested with trypsin . The tryptic peptides were then analyzed by Q Exactive linear quadrupole Orbitrap analyzer ( Thermo Scientific ) ( 205 ) . The MS data were analyzed using SEQUEST ( ThermoFinnigan , San Jose , CA ) and X ! Tandem ( The Global Proteome Machine Organization ) . Scaffold ( Proteome Software Inc . , Portland , OR ; version Scaffold - 3 . 6 ) was used to validate MS / MS - based peptide and protein identifications . Xcalibur software ( Thermo Scientific ) was used to quantify the extracted ion currents ( XICs ) of peptide ions . Detailed parameters for data processing were described 49 previously ( 205 ) . The amount of phosphopeptide was indicated by estimated stoichiometry , which is the ratio of the integrated XIC of the peptide containing individual sites of phosphorylation to the sum of all integrated XICs associated with peptides of the same sequence , a method that produces an approximated value since it does not factor in the individual MS response rates of the different peptide isoforms ( 206 ) . 2 . 15 Quantitative PCR Histological sections and snap frozen fragments of normal and cancerous brain were provided by The Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada Brain Tumour Tissue Bank . All samples used for RNA extraction were pre - screened by a neuropathologist and deemed to be of good quality , indicating a high ratio of tumor cells to necrotic , cauterized , fibrotic , or haemorrhagic tissue . Glioma samples were recovered from the tumor centres ; normal brain was acquired from lobectomy surgeries . Corresponding clinical information was provided for each case . From 50 mg to 100 mg per sample of frozen tissue were homogenized in 1 ml TRIzol Reagent ( Invitrogen ) using a dounce homogenizer . RNA isolation was performed according to TRIzol product documentation , beginning with an optional centrifugation at 12 000 x g for 10 min to remove insoluble material . Pelleted RNA was resuspended in 20 µ l of DEPC - treated water , and concentration was determined using the NanoDrop 1000 ( Thermo Scientific ) . To remove genomic DNA contamination , 3 µg of each RNA sample was reacted with DNase I Amplification Grade ( Invitrogen ) , for a final approximate RNA concentration of 90 ng / ul . Treated RNA was then evaluated using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and companion software ( Agilent Technologies ) to determine RNA Integrity Numbers ( RINs ) . Only samples with a RIN greater than 5 . 0 were used in subsequent quantitative Real Time - PCR . To detect ShcD ( accession NM _ 203349 ) mRNA transcript , we used primers developed by ( 207 ) that span the junction between exons 11 and 12 . Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 ( HPRT1 ) ( NM _ 000194 ) was selected as a reference gene based upon its robust and consistent performance as an endogenous control for brain tissue and malignancy ( 208 - 211 ) . Primer sequences were obtained from ( 211 ) and span exons 6 and 7 . Additional experimental validation was performed to ensure that HPRT levels were stable across the conditions of interest . To test primer efficiencies , input cDNA was serially diluted , and threshold values were compared via linear regression of Δ C T vs . log ( cDNA concentration ) . This 50 yielded a slope of approximately zero , indicating equal efficiencies and enabling us to use the Comparative C T method of relative quantification . All RNA expression tests were performed at The Genomics Facility , University of Guelph . The High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) was used for first strand cDNA synthesis , with components added to the following final concentrations : 1x Reverse Transcription Buffer , 80 nmole dNTPs , 1x random primers , 50 U MultiScribe™ Reverse Transcriptase , made up to 20 µ l with RNA template and water . The reaction was run at 25 °C for 10 min , 37 °C for 120 min , 85°C for 5 min , and 4°C indefinitely . SYBR Green reactions were prepared for quantitative analysis on a StepOnePlus real time PCR thermocycler ( Applied Biosystems ) . Reagents and their final concentrations were : 1x SYBR Green PCR Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems ) , 150 nM each of forward and reverse primers , 5 µ l of a 2x dilution cDNA template , and sterile water , for a final reaction volume of 20 µ l . A no template control was run for each primer pair in each experiment . The amplification program consisted of an initial 10 min hold at 95 °C , followed by 40 cycles of denaturation ( 95 °C for 15 sec ) and annealing / extension ( 60 °C for 1 min ) . All runs were followed by melt curve analysis to detect dissociation of the amplicon . A dynamic range test was performed on a dilution series of RNA , revealing that 300 ng of input template was suitable . This concentration was used in all subsequent reactions . Two technical replicates of each biological sample were run . The 2 - ΔΔ Ct method of Livak and Schmittgen ( 212 ) was used to express fold - induction . Δ C T = Target C T – Normalizer C T or ShcD C T - HPRT C T ; average values obtained for malignant ( n = 14 ) and benign ( n = 2 ) groups were compared via t test ( Graph Pad Prism v6 . 0c ) . ΔΔ C T = ( Δ C T Experimental ) - ( Δ C T Calibrator ) , or ( ShcD Δ C T astrocytoma ) - ( ShcD Δ C T normal ) . Fold induction values for each sample relative to wildtype were presented graphically . 51 Table 2 . 1 .

Wells were then rinsed with 1x PBS to remove unbound ligand , and trypsinized in a small volume to suspend cells , which were then diluted to a final concentration of 1 – 2 million cells / mL in DMEM containing FBS . A Beckman Coulter FC500 flow cytometer and MXP software were used for the analysis . Fluorescence was measured using FL - 1 ( 488 nm ) and FL - 4 ( 647nm ) bandpass filters , and threshold was determined empirically by ensuring that fewer than 10 % of non - transfected , unstimulated control cells exceeded this value . Ligand uptake was calculated as { # green & red cells ( ie . yellow ) } / { total # green cells } x 100 . Brown - Forsythe test of equal population variance , one - way ANOVA , and Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests were performed in Graph Pad Prism 6 . 52 CHAPTER 3 : THE SHCD SIGNALLING ADAPTOR FACILITATES LIGAND - INDEPENDENT PHOSPHORYLATION OF THE EGF RECEPTOR 53 3 . 1 Abstract Proto - oncogenic Shc proteins have been considered archetypal adaptors of EGFR - mediated signaling . We now report that in addition to its role as an EGFR binding partner and Grb2 platform , ShcD acts non - canonically to promote phosphorylation of select EGFR residues . Unexpectedly , Y1068 , Y1148 , and Y1173 are subject to ShcD - induced , cell - autonomous hyperphosphorylation in the absence of external stimuli . This response is not elicited by other Shc proteins and requires the intrinsic EGFR kinase as well as the ShcD PTB domain . Assessments of Erk , Akt , PLC1 γ , and FAK pathways reveal no apparent distal signaling targets of ShcD . Nevertheless , the capacity of cultured cells to repopulate a wounded monolayer is markedly accelerated by ShcD in an EGFR - kinase dependent manner . Furthermore , detection of overexpressed ShcD coincident with EGFR phosphorylation in human gliomas suggests a clinical application for these findings . We thus demonstrate unique and relevant synergy between ShcD and EGFR that is unprecedented among signaling adaptors . 3 . 2 Results 3 . 2 . 1 The ShcD PTB domain binds inducibly to EGFR Y1148 following EGF stimulation . Spot peptide array data have previously revealed a putative interaction between ShcD and EGFR ( 199 ) . To verify this interaction and subsequently map the association to the domains and motifs responsible , we performed binding studies in the COS - 1 model cell system , selected for their robust endogenous expression of EGFR , ligand responsiveness , and amenability to manipulation . In these cells , overexpressed FLAG - tagged ShcD was found to co - precipitate the EGFR following EGF stimulation ( Figure 3 . 1A ) . We then performed parallel immunoprecipitation assays to compare the binding capacities of ShcA , B , C and D , to the EGFR and the Grb2 adaptor in the presence and absence of ligand ( Figure 3 . 1B ) . Consistent with previous findings , we noted that upon EGF administration , ShcA and ShcB co - precipitated a phosphorylated protein of approximately 170 kDa , presumed to be the EGFR . ShcA and ShcB also became phosphorylated under these stimulatory conditions , and their capacities to bind Grb2 increased markedly . Conversely , ShcC failed to bind EGFR or Grb2 and undergo phosphorylation ( Figure 3 . 1B ) , confirming that it is not a physiological substrate of the EGFR , as 54 previously shown ( 21 ) . ShcD , however , was found to have a binding profile similar to that of ShcA and ShcB wherein EGF stimulates ShcD tyrosine phosphorylation and induces its interaction with EGFR and Grb2 ( Figure 3 . 1B ) . To examine whether this interaction is mediated by the PTB and / or SH2 domain of ShcD , we next incubated the isolated GST - conjugated PTB and SH2 domains with lysate from untreated or EGF - stimulated COS - 1 cells . As evidenced by Figure 3 . 1C , the ShcD PTB domain , but not the SH2 domain demonstrated robust affinity for EGFR in the presence of EGF , and this interaction was fully abrogated by the introduction of a point mutation ( R315Q ; PTB * ) that disrupts the pTyr binding capacity of the domain ( 26 ) . Similarly , the ShcA PTB domain exhibited strong association with the tyrosine - phosphorylated EGFR . Lastly we sought to identify the EGFR tyrosine residue ( s ) that interact with the ShcD PTB domain , and clarify whether the association is direct or mediated by additional factors . Four tyrosine residues of the EGFR cytoplasmic tail , consisting of sites Y1086 , Y1114 , Y1148 , and Y1173 exist within the consensus NPXY motif recognized by Shc PTB domains ( 34 , 213 ) . To evaluate the affinity of ShcD for these isolated regions , we performed binding assays utilizing synthetic , biotinylated EGFR peptides spanning these sites , in conjunction with purified GST fusion proteins . Direct interaction was seen between the phosphopeptide corresponding to EGFR phosphorylated on Y1148 and both the ShcD and ShcA PTB domains , and this association was abolished with the ShcD PTB * mutation ( Figure 3 . 1D ) . Furthermore , substitution of either the asparagine or proline to alanine in the NPXY recognition sequence ( NA and PA , respectively ) , or replacement of phosphotyrosine with tyrosine in the EGFR Y1148 peptide produced a marked reduction in ShcD - PTB co - precipitation ( Figure 3 . 1D ) . Collectively these findings confirm an interaction between the ShcD PTB domain and phosphorylated tyrosine residue 1148 on the EGFR . 55 Figure 3 . 1 . The ShcD PTB domain binds to phosphorylated EGFR residue Y1148 following ligand stimulation . ( A ) COS - 1 cells transfected with FLAG - tagged ShcD or vector were serum starved and EGF stimulated . FLAG immunoprecipitations were followed by detection of EGFR . ( B ) Cells expressing ShcA to D were similarly processed and analyzed for phosphotyrosine and Grb2 co - precipitation . 56 ( C ) Purified GST - fusion proteins corresponding to the wildtype or disabled ( * ) ShcD PTB and SH2 domains , and the ShcA PTB domain , were incubated with glutathione beads and lysate from non - transfected , untreated or EGF - stimulated cells . ( D ) The ShcD docking site on EGFR was identified by combining ShcD GST - fusion domains in C with synthetic , biotin labeled EGFR peptides corresponding to known PTB consensus sites ( NPXpY ) . In addition to phosphorylated and non - phosphorylated EGFR variants , we employed the recognition - motif mutants APXpY ( pY1148NA ) and NAXpY ( pY1148PA ) . IP , Immunoprecipitation ; IB , Immunoblot ; PD , Pulldown ; WCL , Whole Cell Lysate . 3 . 2 . 2 ShcD promotes constitutive phosphorylation of the EGFR . Despite mounting biochemical evidence of an interaction between EGFR and ShcD , the relevance of this association to cellular dynamics and signal transduction has not yet been established . We thus intended to monitor temporal , ligand - induced changes in the subcellular localization of GFP - conjugated ShcD and the active EGFR to establish whether , and how , the two constituents associate under physiological conditions . The phosphorylation status of EGFR Tyr 1068 , a residue that serves as both the Grb2 docking site ( 75 , 214 ) and an indicator of intrinsic EGFR kinase activity ( 215 ) , was selected as a metric of receptor activation . To monitor site - specific modifications , we identified an antibody selective for the EGFR pY1068 motif and confirmed that it did not cross - react with the inactive receptor or phosphorylated ShcD in western blots or immunocytochemistry ( Figure S1 ) . We then probed ShcD - GFP transfected COS - 1 cells to discern the patterns of phosphorylation and subcellular localization that occur before and after EGF stimulation . Unexpectedly , we detected EGFR Y1068 phosphorylation prior to ligand exposure in cells expressing ShcD , but not in the surrounding non - transfectants , and this signal remained elevated for the duration of the experiment ( Figure 3 . 2A ) . Conversely , in cells lacking ShcD , EGFR phosphorylation on Y1068 was evident 30 and 60 min after stimulation , and it returned to basal levels by 120 min post - treatment ( Figure 3 . 2A ) . We also observed considerable co - localization between ShcD - GFP and EGFR pY1068 punctae at all time points assessed . The correlation is depicted graphically by plotting individual 57 pixel intensities of the red ( pEGFR ) channel on the abscissa against those of the corresponding green ( ShcD ) signal in the ordinate axis to interpret the degree of pattern overlap ( Figure 3 . 2A ) . The significance of this relationship was analyzed using van Steensel x - translation to generate comparisons between the native pEGFR distribution pattern , and a scrambled ShcD signal displaced in the abscissa ( 202 ) . Pearson’s correlation coefficients ( R ) are shown for the original merged signals , and following various degrees of translation ( Figure 3 . 2A ) . Legitimately co - localized signals produce the highest Rr value from the unaltered images ( Δ x = 0 ) , while translations result in rapid loss of the relationship . The characteristic peaked plot was observed with the ShcD samples , but not with those expressing GFP alone ( Figure 3 . 2A ) . Quantification likewise confirmed that the agreement between EGFR pY1068 and ShcD signals was indeed significant ( Table S1 ) . While co - localization of Shc proteins with EGFR is a documented consequence of ligand exposure ( 53 ) , it has not previously been described in the absence of stimulation , nor is it typically associated with increased receptor phosphorylation . To further investigate the intriguing observation that ShcD enhances EGFR Y1068 phosphorylation , we examined lysates from COS - 1 cells expressing ShcD . Immunoprecipitation of the EGFR , followed by Western blotting for generic phosphotyrosine residues confirmed that the receptor exhibits elevated levels of phosphorylation in ShcD - expressing cells following serum starvation and prior to ligand stimulation ( Figure 3 . 2B ) . This trend was likewise observed in the whole cell lysate , using both the EGFR pY1068 site - specific antibody and the phosphotyrosine antibody . Lastly , considering the amino acid sequence identity across both the PTB and SH2 domains of Shc proteins ( 26 ) , we questioned whether the capacity of ShcD to facilitate ligand - free phosphorylation of EGFR extended to other members of the adaptor family . Figure 3 . 2C depicts immunoblotted lysate from transfected , serum - deprived cells expressing GFP - conjugated ShcA , B , C , D , or GFP alone . Although minimal , basal level tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR band ( ~ 180kDa ) was detected in most lanes , marked up - regulation occurred only in the ShcD sample . This implies that ShcD possesses novel signaling characteristics not present in its homologs . 58 Figure 3 . 2 . EGFR is constitutively phosphorylated in the presence of ShcD . ( A ) Localization and signaling dynamics of proteins of interest were monitored over an extended time course using confocal microscopy of ShcD - GFP / GFP transfected , serum - starved cells pulsed with 50 ng / ml EGF and chased for 2 hours prior to fixation . Receptor activation was monitored by staining with an antibody specific to the phosphorylated Y1068 EGFR residue . 59 Also shown at select time points are localization plots for green and red channels , and van Steensel x - translation to quantify relationship significance . Scale bar = 40 µm . ( B ) The phosphorylation response was further characterized by immunoprecipitating EGFR from cellular lysates , and immunobloting with a generic phosphotyrosine antibody . Cells were maintained in serum - deprived conditions ( EGF - ) or stimulated for 10 minutes ( EGF + ) prior to lysis . ( C ) Comparison of the capacity of over - expressed Shc proteins to induce EGFR phosphorylation during serum withdrawal . IP , Immunoprecipitation ; IB , Immunoblot . 3 . 2 . 3 Multiple EGFR tyrosine residues are affected by ShcD . The technical limitations of antibody - based cellular analysis preclude comprehensive annotation and quantitation of the EGFR phosphorylation sites influenced by ShcD . Thus , to circumvent this constraint , we employed a mass spectrometry ( MS ) technique that has previously been optimized to analyze EGFR phosphorylation ( 205 ) . It relies on overexpression of FLAG epitope - tagged EGFR in the HEK 293 cell line , which naturally expresses negligible levels of endogenous EGFR ( 216 ) . We first sought to determine the suitability of this approach by assessing the level of EGFR - FLAG phosphorylation arising in HEK 293 cells upon transient transfection with ShcD - GFP ( Figure 3 . 3A ) . This yielded an increase in EGFR phosphorylation similar to that observed in COS - 1 cells ( Figure S2 ) , thereby validating the phenotype in an alternative experimental model and allowing us to proceed with MS . For the purposes of MS analysis , EGFR - FLAG was transiently co - transfected along with untagged ShcD to afford control over receptor - adaptor stoichiometry , and allow for FLAG - based purification of EGFR . MS analysis revealed four EGFR pTyr sites in unstimulated cells co - transfected with ShcD and EGFR constructs ( ShcD / EGFR ) ( Table 3 . 1 and Table S2 ) . A representative MS / MS spectrum of the EGFR pTyr peptide containing pY1148 is shown in Figure 3 . 3B . ( Remaining peptide spectra are given in Figure S3 ) . The mass - to - charge ( m / z ) difference between y7 and y8 indicates the pTyr residue ( m / z = 253 . 0 ) of this peptide . In order to compare the relative abundance of EGFR phospho - isoforms with or without phosphorylation at Y1148 , their extracted ion currents ( XICs ) were compared ( Figure 3 . 3C ) . This indicated a greater amount of the pY1148 peptide in cells co - expressing ShcD and EGFR than in cells not expressing ectopic ShcD ( Figure 3 . 3C , upper vs . lower panels on the left ) . Accordingly , there was less of the non - phosphorylated version of the peptide recovered from cells co - expressing 60 both proteins compared with cells expressing only ectopic EGFR ( right , upper vs . lower panels ) . Based on these data the estimated stoichiometry of phosphorylation at position Y1148 in ShcD / EGFR cells was calculated as ~ 22 % ( Table 1 ) , which was more than ten - fold higher than measured in control EGFR cells . Three out of the four EGFR pTyr sites identified by MS analysis were found to have elevated stoichiometry in ShcD / EGFR cells ( Table 3 . 1 and Figure 3 . 3D ) , which was consistent with the Western blot result showing higher levels of EGFR phosphorylation in the ShcD / EGFR cells ( Figure 3 . 3A ) . Therefore , the MS analysis confirmed that there are ShcD - dependent increases in the phosphorylation of multiple EGFR tyrosines residues . 61 Figure 3 . 3 . ShcD promotes phosphorylation of multiple EGFR residues . HEK - 293 cells overexpressing FLAG - tagged EGFR were subjected to analysis by LC - MS / MS . ( A ) To confirm the observations made with COS - 1 cells , ShcD was expressed ectopically in HEK - 293 - EGFR cells , followed by serum deprivation and IP / IB .

Phosphotyrosine is denoted by non - capital y . 3 . 2 . 4 ShcD requires the EGFR kinase to induce EGFR phosphorylation . Considering that Shc family proteins have no documented homology with tyrosine kinases , we were interested in identifying the enzyme ( s ) responsible for phosphorylating EGFR in the absence of external stimuli . The most obvious candidate was the intrinsic EGFR kinase itself , typically responsible for ligand - induced autophosphorylation of the receptor . To evaluate the contributions of this kinase to ShcD - induced phosphorylation , we employed the selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) AG 1478 ( Tyrphostin ) , and first verified its capacity to counteract both basal and ligand - induced phosphorylation of the EGFR ( Figure 3 . 4A ) . Subsequently , we applied the inhibitor to serum - deprived ShcD - expressing cells , and recovered lysate for immunoblot analysis at five time points , ranging from pre - treatment to 120 min incubation . Figure 3 . 4B reveals a steady decrease in the level of phosphorylation from 0 to 60 min , indicating that the effects of ShcD on the EGFR were reversed within 1hr of AG 1478 exposure . ShcD phosphorylation also declined rapidly upon treatment ( Figure 3 . 4B ) , as revealed by immunoblotting with a phospho - Shc antibody that we previously validated for use with ShcD ( 28 ) . To further investigate the extent of Tyrphostin - mediated inhibition , we used confocal microscopy to discern specific and general tyrosine phosphorylation patterns produced by cells before and after treatment with AG 1478 ( Figure 3 . 4C ) . Predictably , the inhibitor ablated EGFR Y1068 phosphorylation ( Figure 3 . 4C , upper panel ) . Staining with a general anti - phosphotyrosine antibody also revealed a drastic decrease in the overall extent of tyrosine phosphorylation in the cell ( Figure 3 . 4C , lower panel ) , arguing that EGFR is the major species subject to ShcD induced phospho - upregulation , and / or that any resulting proximal tyrosine - based signaling events are prevented by inactivating the EGFR kinase . 63 Although these data provide compelling evidence that the EGFR kinase is required for ShcD - induced phosphorylation , they do not eliminate the possibility of other collaborating factors . A prime candidate is the nonreceptor kinase c - Src , as it phosphorylates the activation loop of the EGFR kinase at residue Y845 and is believed to stabilize the enzyme , thereby potentiating catalysis ( 171 ) . Accordingly , synergy between the EGFR and c - Src has been found to enhance tumorigenic cellular characteristics ( 217 ) . To address the possibility that ShcD affects the EGFR via c - Src , we employed the Src Family Kinase ( SFK ) inhibitor PP2 . As depicted in Figure 3 . 4D , a 30 min pretreatment with PP2 reduced the level of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation elicited by EGF applied to non - transfected cells , while a 90 min incubation with the TKI did not appear to counteract ShcD - induced phosphorylation . We therefore conclude that ShcD facilitates EGFR phosphorylation by influencing the intrinsic EGFR kinase in a c - Src independent manner . Having determined the kinase responsible for phosphorylation , we next sought to identify the regions of ShcD that give rise to this phenotype . We focused on modules and residues of known and implied function , using mutant versions of the molecule that disrupt phosphotyrosine binding ( PTB * and SH2 * ) or prevent phosphorylation of the six tyrosines in the CH1 region that coordinate proximal signaling ( Tyr6Phe , or Y6F ) ( 26 ) . Of these modifications , only the R315Q substitution in the PTB domain reduced the level of ShcD - induced EGFR phosphorylation ( Figure 3 . 4E ) . This further emphasizes the importance of the PTB domain in mediating various aspects of the cellular ShcD - EGFR dynamic . 64 Figure 3 . 4 . ShcD - induced EGFR phosphorylation requires the EGFR kinase and the ShcD PTB domain . ( A ) The capacity of 1µM AG 1478 ( Tyrphostin ) vs . DMSO ( vehicle ) to prevent EGFR phosphorylation was verified using untransfected COS - 1 cells in the presence and absence of 50 ng / ml of EGF ( 10 min ) . ( B ) Subsequently , ShcD - overexpressing cells were serum starved and exposed to AG 1478 for varying amounts of time ( in min ) prior to lysis and immunoblotting . ( C ) The interplay between ShcD , the intrinsic EGFR kinase , and the cellular tyrosine phosphorylation profile was further analyzed via confocal microscopy of cells incubated with AG 1478 for 30 to 60 min and probed with anti - EGFR - pY1068 and anti - pTyr antibody . Scale bar = 40 µm . ( D ) Similarly , the SFK inhibitor PP2 ( 10 µM ) was evaluated for its ability to counteract both ligand - ( 10ng / ml , 10 min ) and ShcD - induced EGFR phosphorylation . 65 NTF = non - transfected cells . ( E ) To elucidate the molecular region of ShcD responsible for promoting EGFR phosphorylation , point - mutated variants of the protein containing disrupted PTB or SH2 domains ( PTB * ; SH2 * ) , or the phosphorylation - defective tyrosine - to - phenylalanine substitutions ( Y6F ) were overexpressed in cells . Lysates from serum - deprived samples were immunoblotted for pTyr . IB : Immunoblot . 3 . 2 . 5 ShcD fails to influence major signaling nodes through EGFR . Shc proteins are classically characterized as mediators of EGF - induced MAPK signaling , due to their ability to recruit Grb2 to the burgeoning signaling complex . It has become clear , however , that isoform , homolog , and context - specific differences exist in their signaling potentials ( 218 ) . To elucidate the particular cascades affected by ShcD during serum starvation and following 50 ng / ml EGF exposure , we examined the phosphorylation status of a number of prominent signaling effectors . Although we found that phosphorylation increased on Akt , Erk ( MAPK ) , p38 ( MAPK ) , and PLC1 γ following ligand stimulation , the response did not appear to be modulated by ShcD ( Figure 3 . 5A ) . Indeed , the level of induction observed 10 min post - EGF treatment was comparable between cells expressing ShcD - GFP or GFP alone ( Figure 3 . 5A ) . Prior to stimulation , the phosphorylation profiles of ShcD and GFP - expressing populations were likewise similar . Factors involved in cytoskeletal organization , cell adhesion , and motility can also be affected by Shc proteins ( 218 ) . To survey the biochemical impact of ShcD on such components , we selected FAK as a central actin - mediating hub and EGFR effector , and monitored its phosphorylation at two distinct motifs . The autophosphorylation residue Y397 , which serves as a binding site for proteins including Shc and Src ( 219 ) , was found to be unaffected by the conditions of our analysis ( Figure 3 . 5B ) . Y925 , which is phosphorylated by Src and subsequently coordinates Grb2 ( 219 ) , was responsive to EGF stimulus but not modulated by ShcD expression . Thus , the nature of the signaling cascade downstream of ShcD - activated EGFR remains speculative . 66 Figure 3 . 5 . Proximal signaling through major hubs is not affected by ShcD expression . ( A ) The consequence of ShcD - GFP on signaling events occurring pre - and post - stimulation with 50 ng / ml EGF ( 10 min ) was monitored by immunoblotting lysates for common downstream effectors , to compare total protein levels with the phosphorylated fraction . ( B ) Similarly , cells transfected with ShcD - FLAG were assayed for phosphorylation of FAK on two distinct residues . 67 3 . 2 . 6 EGFR - ShcD synergy promotes monolayer reconstitution . Since biochemical analyses of proximal effectors failed to identify a clear target of constitutive , ShcD - induced EGFR phosphorylation , we elected to examine key cellular processes to determine whether the molecular perturbation had any phenotypic effect . Specifically , ShcD has been implicated as a mechanistic factor in melanoma metastasis , being indispensible for cellular migration ( 27 ) . We thus questioned whether ShcD would have a similar effect in COS - 1 cells , and if so , whether the enhanced migration could be attributed to the influence of ShcD over the EGFR kinase . To address each of these perspectives , we established confluent cultures of ShcD - GFP or GFP transfected cells , serum starved and treated them with the EGFR TKI AG 1478 or vehicle for 6 hours , and introduced a narrow wound to the monolayer . The capacity of cells in each treatment to fill the void was monitored following wound infliction ( T = 0h ) and again at 18 and 48 hours , and analyzed using TScratch software ( 203 ) to quantify the change in area . The results , in Figure 3 . 6A , depict accelerated wound closure in ShcD - expressing cultures treated with DMSO , as compared to those exposed to AG 1478 or expressing GFP alone . One - way ANOVA and Bonferroni ' s Multiple Comparison Test performed on the average change in area across three biological replicates per condition confirmed a significant difference ( p = 0 . 0038 ) between the ‘ShcD + DMSO’ samples and each of the other two treatments ( Figure 3 . 6B ) . We were then curious to determine whether ShcD overexpression conferred resistance to apoptosis during serum starvation , as enhanced longevity could facilitate repopulation of the scratch wound . The enzyme Poly ( ADP ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) , of the DNA repair response , is a major target of caspase - 3 , which cleaves the protein at the recognition sequence DEVD - 216 G - 217 at the onset of apoptosis ( 220 ) . Detection of the resulting 89kDa and 24kDa fragments are thus indicative of programmed cell death . Following overnight serum deprivation of ShcD - or GFP - transfected cells , we collected suspension cells and analyzed their PARP profiles in parallel with those of adherent cells . Immunoblotting with an antibody that recognizes full - length and cleaved PARP revealed that the majority of the protein had been processed by caspase 3 in suspension cells ( Figure 3 . 6C ) . Levels of this 89 kDa form were equivalent between ShcD - and GFP - expressing populations , suggesting that both cultures were equally affected by apoptosis . Conversely , levels of the apoptotic form of PARP were minimal across both ShcD and GFP - transfected adherent cells , while the full - length version was abundant , indicating a similar survival index between both treatments ( Figure 3 . 6C ) . We therefore conclude that ShcD promotes scratch - wound repopulation without affecting cell viability . 68 Figure 3 . 6 . ShcD promotes EGFR - dependent cellular migration . ( A ) To determine the physiological consequences of ShcD - induced EGFR phosphorylation , confluent monolayers of transfected cells were serum - starved and treated with DMSO ( vehicle ) or 1 µM AG 1478 6 hrs prior to inflicting scratch wounds . Matched regions of interest were imaged 0 , 18 , and 48 hrs following the procedure . Scale bar = 140 µm . ( B ) Wound closure was measured by T - Scratch software and expressed as Δ area . Averages of three biological replicates per condition are shown , and were compared by one - way ANOVA ( p = 0 . 0038 ) , followed by Bonferroni ' s Multiple Comparison Test . ( * ) indicates significant difference . Error bars denote SEM . ( C ) Levels of cellular apoptosis were inferred from PARP cleavage patterns in suspension and adherent cells following serum deprivation and 10 min EGF stimulation . 69 3 . 2 . 7 Elevated ShcD expression and enhanced EGFR phosphorylation are detected within primary human brain tumors . In order to understand the potential physiological relevance of ShcD - induced EGFR activation , we sought to identify natural circumstances that promote ShcD upregulation and involve hyperactive EGFR . The nervous system is a major site of ShcD expression ( 26 , 28 ) , thus prompting us to investigate whether oncogenic transformations in the brain are associated with changes in abundance of the ShcD adaptor . To address this question , we performed quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) on a selection of biopsy cores ( n = 14 ) representing grade I through IV astrocytomas . These were analyzed in parallel with benign tissues recovered from lobectomy surgeries , to determine the relative expression level of ShcD in malignant samples . Comparison of the normalized threshold cycle numbers ( Δ C T ) of healthy and diseased tissue revealed a significant difference between the two groups ( p = 0 . 0020 ) ( Figure 3 . 7A ) . Astoundingly , this corresponds to a mean 41 - fold ShcD induction in tumors relative to benign brain , with considerable variability between individual patients ( SEM = 11 . 92 ) ( Figure 3 . 7B ) . Matched paraffin - embedded sections were subsequently stained to detect EGFR pY1068 ( green ) in the context of generic cytological markers tubulin ( red ) and DAPI ( blue ) ( Figure 3 . 7C ) . Although not quantitative , the resulting fluorescence immunohistochemical micrographs clearly reveal enhanced pEGFR signal in the gliomas ( Figure 3 . 7C , I and II ) when compared to benign tissue ( Figure 3 . 7C III ) or a negative control lacking primary antibody ( Figure 3 . 7C IV ) . Both of the malignant samples depicted in Figure 3 . 7C showed robust ShcD upregulation by qPCR , suggesting that elevated ShcD and EGFR phosphorylation coexist under pathological circumstances . 70 Figure 3 . 7 . Elevated ShcD expression and EGFR phosphorylation are characteristic of astrocytoma tumors . ( A ) qPCR was performed to compare ShcD mRNA levels in benign and malignant brain tissue .

Scale bar = 40 µm . 71 3 . 3 Discussion Through a combination of biochemical , cytological , and biophysical techniques , we have demonstrated that ShcD unexpectedly enhances EGFR autophosphorylation in the absence of external stimuli . This response is unprecedented among Shc proteins and signaling scaffolds in general ; to date , the only cytoplasmic , non - kinase components identified as enhancers of EGFR phosphorylation have been members of the cytohesin family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) ( 221 ) . Our data portray ShcD as a direct , PTB - dependent binding partner of EGFR residue pY1148 that constitutively co - localizes with the active receptor and elicits ligand - independent phosphorylation of three EGFR residues via an unidentified mechanism that requires both the ShcD PTB domain and the intrinsic EGFR kinase . Although ShcD does not appear to influence signaling through common proximal effectors , the adaptor in conjunction with the EGFR kinase accelerates cell monolayer reconstitution following scratch injury . Notably , preliminary profiling of glioma mRNA suggests that brain tumors can be subject to drastic ShcD overexpression , thus implying the potential translational significance of our cellular observations . At the molecular level , we report that ShcD has more limited repertoire of EGFR recognition motifs than does ShcA . The latter is known to utilize either its PTB or SH2 domain to bind one of three distinct EGFR residues ( 75 , 77 ) , while ShcD predominantly interacts with EGFR pY1148 in a PTB - mediated fashion . This requires both the correct consensus sequence ( NPXY ) and the phosphorylated moiety . It remains to be seen whether the absence of SH2 domain engagement alters the proximal output of ShcD - mediated cascades . While biochemistry argues that ligand stimulation greatly enhances the interaction between EGFR and ShcD , their extensive co - localization prior to EGF treatment suggests that they weakly associate , or exist as indirect partners in a pre - signaling complex . The most striking feature of these pre - stimulus islands is the preponderance of phosphorylated EGFR , exclusively in the presence of ShcD . Indeed , overexpression of the adaptor promotes constitutive phosphorylation of EGFR Y1068 , Y1148 , and Y1173 in the absence of extrinsic signals . Quantitative MS further determined that the induction level differs by residue , with the most dramatic response being the 11 - fold increase over basal phosphorylation that occurs at Y1148 . At the two additional sites , ShcD produces an approximate 2 - to 3 - fold phospho - upregulation . It is interesting to note that Y1148 is the sole 72 ShcD binding site identified by our investigations . Compelling evidence that ShcA , B , and C do not affect basal EGFR phosphorylation positions ShcD as a unique member of this adaptor family . Importantly , microscopy has established that the capacity of ShcD to facilitate EGFR phosphorylation is a cell autonomous effect , since co - cultured non - transfected cells are not subject to this phenomenon . This precludes the possibility that ShcD initiates an intrinsic autocrine or paracrine stimulus loop , and instead invokes an intracellular mechanism to account for the changes in phosphotyrosine equilibrium . This ligand - free phosphorylation requires , at minimum , the ShcD PTB domain and the intrinsic EGFR kinase . Inhibition of the latter , via the selective TKI AG 1478 , results in rapid loss of phosphorylation on both EGFR and ShcD , suggesting that the enzyme must be constitutively functional to sustain the phosphorylation that we observe . Considering that EGFR activation by a Shc protein is a novel phenomenon , no immediate mechanisms can be inferred from behaviour of the ShcD homologs . However , emerging models describe inside - out signaling and endogenous EGFR activation as novel alternatives to conventional ligand - induced transduction . The traditional perspective that the receptor is exclusively responsive to EGF or oncogenic mutation is being challenged by findings that demonstrate its sensitivity to allosteric regulation by the intracellular juxtamembrane region ( 65 , 74 ) , reactive oxygen species ( 159 ) , and the cytohesin GEFs ( 221 ) . Considering the architecture of the adaptor molecule , it is reasonable to hypothesize that ShcD influences the enzymatic activity of EGFR by coordinating a pTyr residue , thereby protecting the site from dephosphorylation . However , there is no precedence for adaptor proteins to bind the catalytically important EGFR pY845 residue ( 170 ) , and protein recognition events at the interaction motifs of the EGFR carboxy - terminus are not known to influence enzyme activity . Association - mediated protection may nevertheless help to explain the dramatic increase in phosphorylation on Y1148 , the ShcD binding site . Perhaps co - localization of the adaptor with the receptor , as observed before and after ligand stimulation , shields this residue from phosphatases and thus prevents dephosphorylation . This concept of interaction - based phospho - preservation is not novel ; indeed , the duration of ShcA attachment to an upstream binding partner is speculated to be an important parameter in determining phosphatase access ( 55 ) . 73 Although details of the mechanism by which ShcD influences EGFR have yet to be determined , downstream consequences of this response are of prime interest . Prior investigations have found that constitutive EGFR phosphorylation , even at a level below the ligand induction threshold , promotes cellular oncogenic potential ( 139 ) . It has also been shown that silencing ShcD in metastatic melanomas reduces their tumorigenic capacity in nude mice ( 27 ) . Nevertheless , reports have been inconsistent about the specific contributions that ShcD makes to major transduction pathways ( 27 , 222 ) . Our discovery that ShcD does not affect EGFR signaling through the Akt , Erk , p38 , PLC1 γ , or FAK pathways in COS - 1 cells , despite promoting receptor phosphorylation , may suggest that the cells were not captured at an informative time point following protein expression and serum starvation . The fact that ShcD transfectants sustain low levels of EGFR phosphorylation indefinitely raises questions of the subtle , long - term changes to signaling potential that may arise , and the best approaches to analyze such progression . Conversely , observations at the cellular level have been more definitive , revealing that ShcD and the EGFR kinase collaborate to facilitate cell monolayer wound closure in the absence of external stimuli . Metastatic melanoma cells likewise engage ShcD in MAPK - independent chemotactic cellular migration , prompting speculation that ShcD regulates an alternative , unidentified migratory pathway distinct from the Erk cascade ( 27 ) . Intriguingly , we have found that the phenomenon of ShcD overexpression is not exclusive to melanomas , but is also detected in gliomas . Despite reports of the low abundance of this protein in healthy tissues ( 27 ) , it is now evident that ShcD overexpression occurs naturally under select circumstances , and should be considered a pathologically relevant phenomenon . The clinical significance of EGFR deregulation is already well documented in cancers of the nervous system , where overexpression and mutation of the receptor are common in high - grade tumors , and indicative of poor survival ( 223 ) . Accordingly , our immunohistochemical staining confirms that EGFR Y1068 hyperphosphorylation is characteristic of astrocytomas , and occurs in tissues that likewise upregulate ShcD . It is unclear whether ShcD plays a causal role in activating EGFR in this context , though noteworthy that the most common oncogenic mutation , Δ EGFR / EGFRvIII , manifests a cellular phenotype similar to that of overexpressed ShcD . Indeed , Δ EGFR sustains a low level of ligand - independent phosphorylation of residues Y1068 , Y1148 , Y1173 , contributing to the establishment , growth , maintenance , angiogenic potential , and overall tumorigenicity of gliomas ( 139 , 224 , 225 ) . 74 To our knowledge , ShcD is the first non - catalytic protein found to participate in regulating the EGFR phosphotyrosine equilibrium , rendering it a novel and enigmatic component of the signal transduction machinery . Whether this phenomenon is exclusive to ShcD or exists as an unexplored paradigm in adaptor protein biology remains to be seen . 75 3 . 4 Supplemental Material Supplemental Figures Figure S3 . 1 .

ShcA , B , and C also share a conserved sequence that binds adaptin subunits of the AP2 complex , enabling Shc to participate in clathrin - mediated receptor endocytosis . Notably , this motif is absent from the ShcD homolog , which also demonstrates the unique ability to promote ligand - independent phosphorylation of the Epidermal Growth Factor ( EGF ) Receptor ( EGFR ) . We now report that in the presence of ShcD , cultured cells experience markedly reduced EGF uptake , while the EGFR is found prematurely internalized , phosphorylated , and co - localized with ShcD . Disruption of the ShcD Phosphotyrosine Binding ( PTB ) and Src Homology 2 ( SH2 ) domains prevents EGFR sequestration and restores ligand acquisition . To assess molecular trafficking determinants , we transplanted the ShcA adaptin binding motif into the analogous region of ShcD . The ShcD - AD chimera continues to promote pre - stimulus EGFR phosphorylation , but acquires adaptin - binding capacity , and restores ligand uptake in the cell . Thus , ShcD appears to possess several molecular permutations that reroute the canonical EGFR response , which may have implications in development and disease . 4 . 2 Results 4 . 2 . 1 ShcD expression reduces EGF uptake . Canonical Shc signaling involves recruitment of the adaptor to the phospho - activated receptor , followed by internalization and trafficking of the complex ( 218 ) . However , ShcD is unique in lacking the conserved adaptin binding motif , and facilitating EGFR phosphorylation in the absence of exogenous stimuli ( 226 ) . Both of these attributes have the potential to impact EGFR dynamics at the membrane . To compare the ligand response of ShcA and ShcD , we expressed GFP - tagged proteins in COS - 1 cells , which possess robust levels of endogenous EGFR . Serum - starved cells were pulsed at 4°C with Alexa Fluor - 555 tagged EGF , rinsed , and warmed to 37°C to permit internalization of receptor and bound ligand . Confocal microscopy was then used on fixed specimens to evaluate the presence and distribution of Shc and EGF . 81 As anticipated , ShcA - expressing cells formed visible EGF vesicles upon stimulation , and these punctae were found to co - localize extensively with ShcA ( Figure 4 . 1A , top row ) . Conversely , ShcD established a markedly different profile characterized by larger , more globular structures , often residing in the perinuclear space and excluding EGF ( Figure 4 . 1A , second row ) . Such cells were largely devoid of EGF signal altogether . In contrast to both ShcA - and ShcD - expressing cells , control GFP transfectants displayed diffuse green fluorescence that did not align with EGF vesicles . To quantitate this phenomenon , we processed cells by flow cytometry and determined the percentage of transfected ( green ) cells that acquired at minimum a threshold level of EGF ( red ) . As depicted in Figure 4 . 1B , ShcD cells demonstrated significantly reduced red fluorescence as compared to ShcA and GFP . This supports the observations made at the level of individual cells that ShcD expression suppresses ligand uptake . 82 Figure 4 . 1 . ShcD expression reduces cellular acquisition of EGF . ( A ) Confocal microscopy was performed on fixed COS - 1 cells expressing amino - terminally GFP - tagged ShcA , ShcD , or GFP alone , pulsed with EGF Alexa Fluor - 555 at 4ºC followed by a 15 min chase ( T = 15 ) at 37ºC . Control cells remained unstimulated ( T = 0 ) . Scale bar = 20 µm . ( B ) Cells expressing the same ShcA , ShcD and GFP constructs were analyzed by flow cytometry to compare relative levels of EGF Alexa Fluor - 647 acquisition . One - way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test revealed that ShcD transfectants exhibited reduced ligand uptake compared to both ShcA and GFP ( p = 0 . 0001 ) . ( n = 3 , error bars denote SEM . ) 83 4 . 2 . 2 EGFR is sequestered in the cell in the presence of ShcD . Several explanations could account for the reduced ligand acquisition discussed above . One possibility is that , in the absence of the adaptin binding region , ShcD - associated complexes resist endocytosis and remain at the membrane . Our previous work , demonstrating that ShcD elicits premature EGFR phosphorylation ( 226 ) , introduces the additional hypothesis that pre - activation precludes further interaction with ligand , either through conformational change in the receptor ( 74 ) or physical relocation within the cell . In an attempt to distinguish between these hypotheses , we simultaneously monitored Shc - GFP ( depicted in blue ) , total EGFR or active fractions ( depicted in green ) , and EGF Alexa Fluor 647 ( red ) , in relation to the nucleus ( DAPI , shown in grey ) ( Figure 4 . 2A ) . The phosphorylation status of EGFR residue Y1068 , which is a major and immediate target of the intrinsic kinase and a primary Grb2 binding site ( 71 ) , was used as a readout of receptor phospho - activation . Consistent with our findings from Figure 4 . 1A , we noted three - way co - localization in ShcA expressing cells , indicating that the adaptor associated with vesicles that were positive for EGFR , phospho - EGFR , and EGF , which appear white in the composite images ( Figure 4 . 2A ) . These punctae were found to distribute uniformly throughout the cytoplasm . Also as anticipated , GFP alone ( Figure 4 . 2A ) was unresponsive to stimulus , and did not influence the distribution of receptor or ligand . By contrast , ShcD was again identified in more central , clustered formations that excluded EGF ( Figure 4 . 2A ) . The close nuclear proximity of the structures suggests internalized complexes . Notably , however , the ShcD punctae were positive for both EGFR , and pEGFR Y1068 , which appear cyan in the merged figure . The conspicuous absence of ligand in these vesicles implies that receptor localization and phosphorylation are both functions of ShcD , and not a consequence of stimulus . Focusing on the serum - deprived state , we confirmed that ShcD maintained its highly punctate distribution irrespective of external stimuli , and in stark contrast to the diffuse and uniform appearance of ShcA ( Figure 4 . 2B ) . Consistent with our previous report ( 226 ) , ShcD co - localized with phospho - upregulated EGFR ( Figure 4 . 2B ) . It would thus appear that ShcD restricts EGF uptake by sequestering receptors in the cell , in a pre - phosphorylated state , where they are less available to exogenous signals . The demonstrable loss of EGFR from the membrane suggests that ShcD subverts traditional turnover , yet the extent of its influence on the global cellular EGFR equilibrium remained unclear . It is conceivable that ShcD - induced internalization accelerates lysosomal 84 degradation of EGFR , an hypothesis we sought to test by evaluating total EGFR protein levels in unstimulated cells . The immunoblot in Figure 4 . 2C confirms that there were no discernable changes in total EGFR between cells expressing ShcA , ShcD , or GFP . Pre - and post - stimulus cells were further assessed for the activation of EGFR residue Y1045 , a recognition motif for the c - Cbl E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been implicated in facilitating ubiquitination required for lysosomal targeting ( 108 ) . Mutagenesis of this site results in degradation - defective EGFR . While the immunoblot in Figure 4 . 2D clearly shows general phosphotyrosine upregulation in unstimulated ShcD cells , it failed to detect differential phosphorylation of Y1045 at time zero . Following stimulation , however , the EGF receptors in both ShcD and control cells appeared to have similar capacity to induce phosphorylation of this motif ( Figure 4 . 2D ) . This reinforces our previous findings that ShcD alone influences a limited repertoire of EGFR phospho - sites ( 226 ) , and is not involved in pre - destining the EGFR for degradation . Considering that EGFR and ShcD co - localize in internal cellular structures , it was of further interest to determine whether they were trafficking through a canonical pathway . It has previously been shown that ShcA is recruited to the EGFR immediately upon stimulation ( 82 ) , and co - migrates with the receptor as it is internalized into early endosomes ( 227 ) . To determine whether ShcD was associated with early endosomes either before or after EGF stimulus , we probed for the Early Endosome Antigen I ( EEA1 ) marker . As depicted in Figure 4 . 2E , ShcA could be induced by ligand to co - localize with EEA1 , while ShcD remained largely distinct from these vesicles , despite its punctate appearance prior to stimulation . Thus , ShcD appears to re - route EGFR into internal compartments that are somewhat removed from traditional catabolic and recycling pathways . 85 Figure 4 . 2 . EGFR is sequestered in the cell in the presence of ShcD . ( A ) Cells expressing ShcA - GFP , ShcD - GFP , and GFP alone were stained to detect the distribution of total EGFR and EGFR phosphorylated on residue Y1068 following a 10 min pulse ( T = 10 ) with EGF Alexa Fluor - 647 , as compared to untreated samples ( T = 0 ) . Artificially - coloured 4 - channel detection allowed simultaneous assessment of the GFP - tagged species ( blue ) , EGFR or pEGFR ( green ) , EGF ( red ) and nucleus ( grey ) . ( B ) The phosphorylation status of EGFR under serum deprived conditions in the presence of ShcA and ShcD was evaluated . ( C ) Total levels of endogenous EGFR protein in transfected , unstimulated cells were compared via western blot to assess whether ShcD was influencing the receptor equilibrium . 86 ( D ) Phosphorylation of the EGFR binding motif for the E3 ubiquitin ligase c - Cbl was probed using a site - and phospho - specific antibody against residue pY1045 . The capacity of ShcD to activate this site , pre - and post - ligand exposure , was compared to a GFP control . ( E ) Recruitment to early endosomes was assessed via the Early Endosomal Antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) marker applied to fixed cells subsequent to either serum starvation ( T = 0 ) or an EGF pulse followed by 10 min internalization incubation ( T = 10 ) . Magnified regions of interest are denoted in the composite image . All scale bars = 20 µm . IP : Immunoprecipitation . IB : Immunoblot . 4 . 2 . 3 The ShcD PTB domain influences the EGFR phospho - profile and ligand acquisition . Prior investigations into the binding and signalling dynamics of EGFR and ShcD revealed the importance of the PTB domain in dictating interactions and outcomes . It was found to be necessary and sufficient to mediate receptor binding , and also central to the phenomenon of ShcD - induced EGFR phosphorylation ( 226 ) . We therefore reasoned that the PTB domain might further participate in the altered EGFR trafficking observed in ShcD - expressing cells . We first verified that a targeted mutation of the PTB domain ( PTB * ; R315Q ) in the otherwise wildtype protein was largely capable of preventing ligand - independent phosphorylation of the EGFR at tyrosine 1068 , a residue that we have used previously to infer activation of the innate kinase ( 226 ) ( Figure 4 . 3A ) . Meanwhile , ShcD with the equivalent substitution in the SH2 domain ( SH2 * ; R548K ) retained the capacity to prematurely induce EGFR phosphorylation . The compound ablation of both domains ( PTB * / SH2 * ) was found to behave in a similar fashion to the PTB * mutation alone , albeit with slightly more penetrance ( Figure 4 . 3A ) . Following stimulation , phosphorylated EGFR was identified in punctate structures where it failed to co - localize with mutant ShcD , thus suggesting that the receptor was relieved of ShcD control and was responding to exogenous EGF . To confirm that ligand uptake was in fact restored in cells expressing tyrosine - binding - defective ShcD , pulsed EGF Alexa Fluor - 555 was assessed after a 15 - minute incubation at 37°C . ShcD PTB * / SH2 * transfectants demonstrated a clear capacity to amass ligand in vesicles , unlike ShcD wildtype counterparts ( Figure 4 . 3B ) . Moreover , the ShcD PTB * / SH2 * and EGF punctae were anti - co - localized , suggesting that the loss - of - function mutation permits EGF uptake by uncoupling ShcD from EGFR . 87 Figure 4 . 3 . The ShcD PTB domain influences the EGFR phospho - profile and ligand acquisition . ( A ) Single amino acid substitutions in the ShcD PTB domain ( PTB * R315Q ) and / or SH2 domain ( SH2 * ; R548K ) that disrupt phosphotyrosine mediated interactions ( 226 ) were used to evaluate the contributions of the domains on EGFR phosphorylation status and localization . Confocal microscopy depicts both the transfected cell of interest ( green ) and surrounding non - transfectants for reference . ( B ) Similarly , the compound PTB * / SH2 * mutant was evaluated in parallel with wildtype ShcD and GFP for its ligand uptake potential . All scale bars = 20 µm . 88 4 . 2 . 4 Chimeric ShcD containing the adaptin binding motif promotes EGF internalization . Evidently , ShcD requires phosphotyrosine binding functionality in order to perturb trafficking of EGF and its receptor . This does not imply , however , that the domains themselves are sufficient to elicit this response , only that they are required . At most , our findings suggest that there is a yet - unidentified feature of ShcD that alters patterns of receptor internalization . The conspicuous absence of the otherwise conserved adaptin binding motif from the ShcD CH1 region raises the possibility that this deficit renders ShcD a trafficking - defective adaptor that impedes the canonical flow of EGFR between the cell surface and endomembrane compartments . Under the hypothesis that differential recruitment of AP2 adaptins , and hence , clathrin , could establish distinct fates for ShcA versus ShcD , we inserted the ShcA adaptin binding motif ( Figure 4 . 4A ) and a short stretch of flanking sequence into the equivalent location of the wildtype ShcD backbone . The resulting chimeric protein is henceforth designated ShcD - AD . The isolated peptide corresponding to this stretch of the CH1 region was confirmed to bind to alpha - adaptin in cellular lysates ( Figure 4 . 4B ) . In contrast , the FA mutant contains two phenylalanine - to - alanine substitutions that are known to disrupt adaptin binding ( 101 ) , as we verified in Figure 4 . 4B . Lysates recovered from cells expressing the chimeric proteins were subject to reciprocal co - immunopreciptations to evaluate the adaptin binding potential of modified ShcD . As shown in Figure 4C , the addition of the AD motif substantially enhanced the ShcD - adaptin interaction . FA mutations within the sequence reduced co - precipitation of FLAG - tagged ShcD with alpha - adaptin , but did not diminish the interaction to the level of wildtype ShcD ( Figure 4 . 4C ) . Confocal microscopy yielded consistent findings at the level of individual cells . The lack of adaptin co - localization noted in ShcD wildtype cells was rectified with ShcD - AD , both before and after ligand treatment ( Figure 4 . 4D ) . As we found with ShcA , ShcD - AD - positive structures were identifiable in the adaptin staining patterns themselves due to their irregular shapes and sizes ( denoted with arrowheads in Figure 4 . 4D ) . This co - localization was lost in cells expressing ShcD - FA ( Figure 4 . 4D ) . The AD insertion therefore represents an artificial yet biologically - relevant gain - of - function mutation that extends the ShcD interactome . However , the extent to which ShcD - AD would mimic ShcA dynamics remained to be seen . 89 Figure 4 . 4 . Introduction of the ShcA AP2 recognition motif to ShcD restores adaptin binding . ( A ) Schematic comparison of ShcA and ShcD proteins , depicting the conserved adaptin binding motif ( AD ) identified by ( 101 ) , which is absent in ShcD . The wildtype AP2 region and disabled Phe to Ala ( FA ) mutant ( substitution sites denoted in bold ) were introduced into the analogous region of ShcD to generate chimeric adaptors .

( C ) Chimeric ShcD constructs depicted in 4A were expressed in cells , and resulting lysates were subject to reciprocal co - immunoprecipitation to determine whether the transplanted sequence endowed ShcD with adaptin binding functionality .

Magnified regions of interest are denoted in the composite image . Scale bar = 20 µm . IP : Immunoprecipitation . IB : Immunoblot . As we have previously demonstrated , ShcD appears to be the only member of the Shc family that is capable of activating the EGFR kinase ( 226 ) , and is also the only homolog that lacks the adaptin binding motif ( 26 , 27 ) . It was therefore a priority to determine whether ShcD - AD retained the capacity of wildtype ShcD to provoke ligand - free EGFR phosphorylation , or whether the AD motif would circumvent this response . Figure 4 . 5A reveals that ShcD - AD was found in punctate form , co - localized with EGFR pY1068 both before and after stimulus . These observations confirm that this unique property of ShcD is not affected by the transplanted motif . The question still remained whether introducing the adaptin binding region to ShcD was sufficient to alter the cellular trajectory of EGF and its receptor . To address this , we again used flow cytometry to evaluate ligand uptake , and discovered that cells expressing ShcD - AD experienced a significant boost in the amount of EGF Alexa Fluor - 647 they acquired ( Figure 4 . 5B ) . ShcD - FA was also found to enhance ligand acquisition , though not to the same extent as the wildtype motif . By microscopy , internalized EGF punctae were clearly present and localized with ShcD - AD , while much of this was lost with ShcD - FA ( Figure 4 . 5C ) . This striking result demonstrates that the gain of AP2 - binding functionality in ShcD does indeed influence the EGF ( R ) equilibrium in the cell . In its wildtype form , ShcD appears to lack the requisite sequence to participate in canonical EGFR trafficking . 91 Figure 4 . 5 . The ectopic adaptin binding motif in ShcD promotes ligand internalization . ( A ) Cells expressing ShcD - AD were stained with anti - EGFR pY1068 prior to ( T = 0 ) and following ( T = 10 ) EGF internalization , to assess the influence of the chimeric region on EGFR hyperphosphorylation . ( B ) Flow cytometry revealed a statistically significant increase in the amount of EGF acquired by cells expressing ShcD - AD . ( ANOVA P = 0 . 0008 ; multiplicity adjusted P values of Tukey’s comparison test : * * * P = < 0 . 001 , * P = < 0 . 05 ; n = 3 , error bars denote SEM . ) ( C ) The implications of ShcD chimeric protein expression on EGF acquisition and distribution were assessed by confocal microscopy following administration of EGF Alexa Fluor 555 . All scale bars = 20 µm . 92 4 . 3 Discussion The impetus to study ShcD in the context of EGFR trafficking arose from the recognition of two distinguishing features of ShcD : the loss of an AP2 binding motif that is otherwise conserved across all other Shc homologs ( 26 , 27 ) , and the adaptor’s unique capacity to elicit stimulus - independent phosphorylation of the EGFR ( 226 ) . Together , these observations suggest a non - canonical relationship between receptor and adaptor that warranted further investigation . To that end , we have now demonstrated that expression of ShcD reduces EGF uptake and promotes receptor accumulation in intracellular structures , where it is prematurely phosphorylated and sequestered from ligand . EGFR mislocalization and hyperphosphorylation are both circumvented in cells expressing phosphotyrosine binding - defective ShcD , while the addition of the ShcA adaptin binding motif to the ShcD CH1 region restores only ligand uptake . The implications of these findings , and their relevance to developmental and disease processes , are intriguing and subject to speculation . As we and others have shown , the canonical association between EGFR and ShcA is ligand - induced . Prior to stimulus , EGFR is inactive at the membrane , while ShcA is diffuse throughout the cytosol ; subsequent EGF exposure promotes receptor phosphorylation and accumulation in early endosomes , where it co - localizes with both the ligand and the ShcA adaptor ( 53 , 227 ) . Conversely , in the basal state , ShcD is found in punctae together with tyrosine - phosphorylated EGFR , and upon stimulation , the ligand uptake capacity of these cells is diminished . Thus , three hallmarks of the EGFR - ShcD dynamic appear to be sequestration , phosphorylation , and ligand exclusion . A major question that remains is whether – and how – these distinct phenotypes are related . Might ShcD - induced EGFR activation prevent the receptor from coordinating ligand and cycling appropriately between the cell surface and vesicles ? Or is disrupted trafficking a cause rather than a consequence of aberrant EGFR phosphorylation ? Alternatively , there may be no direct relationship between phenomena . The use of both loss - and gain - of function mutations has helped to clarify the anomalous role of ShcD , and the contributions of its distinct modules . 93 Previously , we generated and employed phosphotyrosine binding - impaired ShcD mutants , PTB * and SH2 * , to determine the relative utility of the domains in receptor binding and signalling ( 26 , 226 ) . ShcD - induced alterations in both ligand acquisition and EGFR hyperphosphorylation are rectified by combined loss - of - function mutations of the PTB and SH2 domains , demonstrating that the phenotypes are indeed linked by a common requirement for tyrosine binding functionality . Our prior investigations revealed that the interaction between EGFR and ShcD is primarily PTB dependent ( 226 ) . Thus , the ShcD PTB * / SH2 * variant has the effect of uncoupling the adaptor from the receptor , as confirmed by their evident dissociation . This loss of proximity between ShcD and EGFR appears to relieve the receptor of ShcD control , and its many facets of influence . Taking a complementary approach , we generated the gain - of - function ShcD - AD chimera to highlight the unique characteristics of ShcD that arise specifically from the evolutionary loss of the AD region . When expressed in cells , this chimera establishes a punctate distribution prior to ligand stimulation , and also maintains the ability to promote ligand - independent phosphorylation of the EGFR , with which it constitutively localizes . Strikingly though , ShcD - AD transfectants acquire the capacity to internalize ligand into punctate structures that co - localize with the chimeric adaptor , regardless of premature EGFR activation . This represents an intermediate phenotype of sorts , displaying characteristics of both ShcA ( ligand acquisition ) and ShcD ( EGFR hyperphosphorylation ) . The potential of this protein to mediate both outcomes underscores that basal - state phospho - upregulation and ligand responsiveness are not mutually exclusive . It also argues against a model in which EGFR hyperphosphorylation arises as a direct result of ShcD - induced endocytosis malfunctions . Overall , introducing the missing AP2 binding motif to ShcD has profound consequences on the behaviour of EGF and its receptor , restoring them to more traditional response patterns . Does this render wildtype ShcD a naturally occurring dominant negative in the realm of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and ligand uptake ? We propose instead that ShcD behaviour represents a gain of novel function , rather than a loss of conserved function . Its unique properties can be manipulated by enabling AP2 binding , but they are not inherently a consequence of its absence . Consider the aforementioned distinct but parallel mechanisms of EGFR endocytosis . Although CME is the primary internalization pathway ( 107 ) , targeted clathrin ablation has only a modest effect on EGFR internalization at the physiological EGF concentrations ( 108 ) employed in our study . Thus , even in the absence of CME , internalization should still proceed . 94 This concept of parallel and / or redundant pathways can also be appreciated at the molecular level . The cytoplasmic tail of EGFR contains a high efficiency binding site for AP2 , centred around Y974 ( 97 ) . The existence of a direct interaction motif suggests that the EGFR is not critically reliant on accessory factors , Shc or otherwise , to connect with AP2 . Accordingly , ShcA - FA does not substantially reduce ligand uptake compared to control cells ( 101 ) . The failure of this ShcA mutant to act as a strong dominant negative reinforces the concept that there are multiple routes of internalization , and potentially several layers of regulation therein . Although the contributions of the AP2 binding region to ShcB and C biology have never been pursued , the ShcA model suggests that this motif in the context of a Shc protein is involved in subtle modulation of EGFR CME , as opposed to being a driving force . The single most compelling piece of evidence that our phenotype of interest is not , primarily , a CME defect is the observation that ShcD is pre - clustered in internal punctae with activated EGFR prior to ligand stimulation . This demonstrates that EGFR is not simply unresponsive at the surface , but instead is physically removed from the extracellular space in which it would coordinate ligand . Atypical EGFR phosphorylation and vesicular distribution are maintained with the ShcD - AD , albeit in a slightly different pattern . While ShcA has the effect of fine - tuning ligand - induced AP2 recruitment to the EGFR ( 101 ) , ShcD promotes focal intracellular accumulation of the receptor regardless of exogenous stimuli . Our data thus suggest that ShcD is actively hijacking the EGFR instead of passively failing to assemble the requisite CME componentry . It was beyond the scope of the present study to directly assess whether the EGF receptors that are found pre - emptively phosphorylated and co - localized with ShcD are newly synthesized proteins that fail to reach the membrane before encountering ShcD , or whether ShcD is involved in removing them from the surface . However , a clue is provided by the fact that the adaptin binding motif ( AD ) insertion restores EGFR - ShcD cycling between cell surface and cytoplasm . AP2 adaptins are uniquely involved in endocytosis from the plasma membrane , and are not utilized in intracellular vesicle formation ( 89 ) . Thus , it stands to reason that the phenotypic rescue induced by the AD motif is likely initiated at the membrane . 95 All things considered , we propose that wildtype ShcD recruits EGFR from the membrane , where it induces phosphorylation and internalization by an unidentified mechanism . Addition of the adaptin binding motif to ShcD may have the effect of recruiting AP2 , and hence , clathrin , to the burgeoning basal - state EGFR - ShcD association , such that internalization occurred by CME instead of the hitherto unexplained pathway . Trafficking via this canonical endocytic route could promote recycling to the membrane , rather than the intracellular sequestration that we observe with wildtype ShcD . Alternatively , the shift in ligand responsiveness that we observe upon introducing the chimeric ShcD - AD may be unrelated to the mechanics of CME . Perhaps simply by enabling a direct interaction between ShcD and adaptins , the transplanted binding motif promotes increased ShcD membrane localization , and mobilization or turnover of sequestered vesicles . ShcD is notably lacking elements of the PH domain that is conserved across the rest of the family , and has a role in membrane targeting ShcA ( 27 , 39 ) . Presumably , in either scenario , EGFR would fluctuate between a ShcD - affiliated auto - phosphorylated form , and a membrane - situated ‘off’ configuration that was primed to receive ligand . As we have observed , stimulus - induced activation of the EGFR recruits ShcD - AD , and the ligand , receptor , and adaptor traffic together , reminiscent of classic ShcA behaviour . It remains to be seen what purpose is served by the anomalous trafficking behaviour of wildtype ShcD , and how it manifests in cell physiology . Yet , the consequence of endosomal mislocalization has been studied in the context of EGFR / MAPK signalling . Altering the spatial properties of late endosomes elicits changes in the duration of EGFR activation , rate of degradation , and the identity and consequence of downstream effectors , thus illustrating the informatic signaling role played by spatial and temporal resolution ( 228 ) . Accordingly , RTK internalization and trafficking have been identified as points of dysregulation contributing to the development of cancer ( 229 ) , prompting speculation about the significance of ShcD upregulation we have documented in gliomas ( 226 ) . Intriguingly , a model of oxidative stress - induced EGFR activation has emerged that shares striking similarities with our findings . Evidence suggests that hydrogen peroxide instigates a unique pattern of EGFR phosphorylation that promotes sustained receptor activation and perinuclear accumulation , while resisting down - regulation ( 142 , 159 , 160 ) . The intrinsic EGFR kinase phosphorylates residues Y845 , Y1068 , and Y1173 , but not the c - Cbl motif , Y1045 ( 160 ) . We discovered previously that ShcD likewise facilitates EGFR 96 phosphorylation on Y1068 and Y1173 ( 226 ) , and we report here the conspicuous absence of P - Y1045 . The discovery that H 2 O 2 promotes caveolin - mediated trafficking of the EGFR ( 142 ) suggests an avenue of future investigation . Altogether , this work provides further evidence of a truly divergent role for the ShcD protein in growth factor signalling and trafficking dynamics . 97 CHAPTER 5 : FRONTIERS OF SHCD : THE QUEST FOR A UNIFYING MECHANISM 98 5 . 1 Abstract Owing to the relatively recent discovery of ShcD , its characterization lags drastically behind that of its homologs . We have provided some of the first reports of its impact on the cell , including its capacity to induce ligand - independent EGFR auto - activation , and sequester the receptor in interior vesicles away from ligand . What remains to be determined are the precise circumstances under which these biochemical phenotypes appear , the underlying molecular features that give rise to them , the cellular interactome that effects change , and the physiological outcomes and implications of ShcD - mediated cellular re - wiring . Accordingly , the work described herein was undertaken in an attempt to construct and assess potential models of ShcD behaviour , and identify relevant , promising avenues for future investigation . Briefly , we report evidence of ShcD - mediated suppression of the Erk MAPK following ligand stimulation of the EGFR . We suggest that the intracellular accumulation of EGFR and ShcD is an emergent property of the complex , and not an inherent feature of ShcD . Further characterization of the ShcD - AD chimera reveals that although it restores ligand uptake , the protein demonstrates trafficking defects . In pursuing a microtubule connection for this phenotype , we have determined that ShcD routinely localizes to the pericentriolar area , and appears to be associated with its disorganization , although it is not clear whether it has a causative role in this . Oxidative stress is considered a major driver of non - canonical EGFR signalling , and we now report that hydrogen peroxide can activate the EGFR in COS - 1 cells . Moreover , it appears to accentuate the phospho - induction promoted by ShcD . To follow up on this , we have generated two mutant ShcD constructs , S55A and C84S , that abolish putative ROS - responsive foci . Finally , we juxtapose two model cancer cell lines , A431 and U87 , which differentially modulate EGFR / ShcD and serve to illustrate that the synergy between the receptor and adaptor are context dependent . 5 . 2 Results 5 . 2 . 1 Proximal signalling revisited In Chapter 3 , we demonstrated via Western blotting that ShcD had no discernable impact on the phosphorylation status ( activation ) of several candidate effectors , including the MAPK Erk . However , further analysis at the level of single , transiently transfected cells , as 99 provided by confocal microscopy , challenges that perspective . As depicted in Figure 5 . 1 , Erk phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation could be induced through EGF stimulation in non - transfected COS - 1 cells . This was not the case for the adjacent cells expressing ShcD , which generally displayed equivalent levels of total Erk , but failed to elicit effector phosphorylation or relocation upon ligand exposure . The level of Erk was likewise unaffected in serum - starved , unstimulated ShcD - positive cells , despite their capacity to undergo cell - autonomous EGFR phosphorylation in the presence of ShcD ( discussed in Chapters 3 and 4 ) . These findings reinforce our previous conclusion that Erk is not a relevant downstream target of ShcD - induced , ligand - independent EGFR activation . However , contrary to our earlier claims , Figure 5 . 1 suggests that in fact ShcD exerts an inhibitory influence over Erk under stimulatory conditions . In attempt to confirm these findings and assess the implications of Erk suppression , we sought to employ a phospho - specific antibody raised against EGFR residue pT669 , which is a target of Erk - mediated regulatory phosphorylation ( 72 ) . However , preliminary proof - of - principle evaluations revealed that the antibody failed to adequately discriminate the stimulatory effect of ligand in control cells , while co - localization analyses of EGFR pT669 with pan - EGFR or EGFR pY1068 were also not compelling ( data not shown ) . Therefore , this avenue of investigation was not pursued . Figure . 5 . 1 . ShcD suppresses Erk activation following EGF stimulation . Fixed ShcD - GFP expressing COS - 1 cells and neighbouring non - transfectants were monitored by confocal microscopy for total - Erk distribution , as well as p - Erk ( T202 / Y204 ) staining pre - and 10 min post - exposure to 50 ng / ml EGF . White asterisks demarcate ShcD - expressing cells at T = 10 . Scale bar = 20 µm . 100 5 . 2 . 2 Conscious uncoupling of ShcD and EGFR One of the hallmarks of the EGFR - ShcD phenotype is the striking and persistent co - localization of the proteins , as discussed in Chapter 4 . Introduction of ShcD into COS - 1 cells drastically alters the distribution of the EGFR , appearing to sequester it in punctae that are often perinuclear . To date , the only intervention that has succeeded in disrupting the constitutive association between these proteins has been a selective PTB mutation that renders the domain unresponsive to phosphorylated tyrosine residues ( Figure 4 . 3A ) . Beyond that , many aspects of this relationship remain unclear , including the determinants that define this pattern of localization , and the structural and functional requirements that enable EGFR to participate . Because COS - 1 cells express robust levels of endogenous EGFR , the characteristics of ShcD in the absence of the receptor had not been explored . To address this deficit , we expressed EGFR and ShcD individually and in parallel in the HEK 293T cell line , which produces only low levels of EGFR naturally . The intention was to assess whether ShcD was responsible for establishing the pattern of sub - cellular localization de novo , and recruiting EGFR into intracellular vesicles . As shown in Figure 5 . 2A , EGFR was found to be constitutively active upon over - expression in this line , although some additional ligand responsiveness was inferred from the appearance of punctate structures after stimulus ( 10 minute chase ) . Although cell morphology was hard to discern due to the spherical architecture of these cells , EGFR appeared to be distributed relatively uniformly in the absence of ShcD ( Figure 5 . 2A , rows 1 - 2 ) . On its own , ShcD assumed a diffuse appearance throughout the cytosol ( Figure 5 . 2A , rows 3 - 4 ) , which contrasts notably with its punctate or vesicular presentation in COS - 1 cells . Strikingly , co - expression of EGFR and ShcD in HEK 293T cells resulted in the appearance of large intracellular globules containing both proteins ( Figure 5 . 2A rows 5 - 6 ) . This suggests that the subcellular localization of EGFR - ShcD is a property of the complex itself , and not an inherent quality of one of the participating proteins . When EGFR is found with ShcD in internal structures , it appears to be constitutively phosphorylated on multiple residues , and this property has been traced to the intrinsic EGFR kinase itself . We therefore questioned whether sustained catalytic activity was required to maintain the association and the pattern of subcellular localization . Previously , we demonstrated that the specific EGFR kinase inhibitor AG 1478 ( Tyrphostin ) reversed ShcD - induced EGFR phosphorylation within one hour of administration ( Figure 3 . 4 B , C ) . To expand on these findings 101 and determine the consequences of catalytic inhibition on the distribution and localization of EGFR and ShcD , we treated ShcD - expressing COS - 1 cells with 1 µm AG 1478 for 1 hour , and analyzed the resulting EGFR pY1068 and pan - EGFR signatures . Phosphorylated EGFR represented a control to ensure that the inhibitor was active and penetrating the cells effectively . Although the extent of phosphorylation decreased in treated cells , evidence of EGFR activation remained ( Figure 5 . 2B , rows 1 - 2 ) . Even when the period of inhibition was extended to 4 hrs , pockets of ShcD - induced EGFR phosphorylation could still be detected ( data not shown ) , indicating that the drug was not fully perfusing the sample . Analysis of total EGFR following 1 hr of pharmacological inhibition revealed that it largely remained co - localized with ShcD ( Figure 5 . 2B , rows 3 - 4 ) . There was nevertheless the suggestion that vesicles were slightly smaller and / or more dispersed in AG 1479 - treated cells . It is important to note that , due to technical limitations , EGFR pY1068 and total - EGFR could not be co - stained on the same samples . The existence of refractory phosphorylation , and the inability to monitor it in tandem with pan - EGFR , represent major confounds in the interpretation of these data . Because AG 1478 treatment was not fully penetrant , we cannot definitively conclude that EGFR and ShcD remain juxtaposed in the absence of EGFR activation . We have , however , provided tentative evidence that the association is somewhat drug resistant , and should be further investigated . 102 Figure 5 . 2 . EGFR - ShcD collaboration dictates subcellular localization . ( A ) HEK 293T cells were transfected with EGFR , ShcD - GFP , or both constructs , and stained to detect EGFR pY1068 ( B ) COS - 1 cells expressing ShcD - GFP were treated with 1 µm AG 1478 for 60 min prior to fixation . Cells were analyzed for phosphorylated EGFR and total EGFR . Scale bars = 20 µm . 103 5 . 2 . 3 Differential modulation of trafficking and cytoskeletal architecture In Chapter 4 , we demonstrated that inserting the AP2 binding motif into the ShcD CH1 region was sufficient to restore ligand uptake in cells that otherwise would have undergone ShcD - mediated EGF exclusion . The change in EGF internalization dynamics also suggests a corresponding alteration in EGFR trafficking behaviour , both in terms of maintaining a ligand - responsive population of EGFR at the membrane , and facilitating the post - endocytic relocation after stimulation . To begin evaluating whether the chimeric ShcD - AD protein promotes phenotypically normal EGFR trafficking , we performed live cell imaging on ShcD - expressing COS - 1 cells that were stimulated with EGF . This allowed us to track individual vesicles in the same transfected cell over the duration of the experiment , and compare this behaviour directly to that of the juxtaposed , non - transfected cells . Individual frames representing 5 min intervals are shown in Figure 5 . 3A . As we previously documented , ShcD - AD was found to co - localize extensively with the ligand , which is not characteristic of the wildtype ShcD protein . However , the endocytic and post - internalization trajectory differed between ShcD - AD - expressing cells and their neighbors . Ligand uptake in non - transfected , co - cultured cells was characterized by a relatively rapid involution from the membrane and departure from the cell periphery ; as vesicles migrated centrally they also increased in size . By contrast , ShcD and EGF appeared to be detained together near the perimeter of transfected cells , and the vesicles remained small . This observation was further validated by generating a 3D gamma intensity surface profile for the ShcD - expressing cell and a neighbouring non - transfectant , at the 20 min time point ( Figure 5 . 3A , bottom panel ) . The resulting plot depicts numerous individual peaks in the ShcD cells , representing distinct EGF foci that remained decentralized . Meanwhile , the non - transfected cell demonstrated evidence of vesicle fusion and / or maturation . Movement through the endomembrane system , and the cell , is an orchestrated process involving numerous components , including Rab GTPases and their effectors , cytoskeletal structures , and motor proteins ( 92 , 230 ) . The deficits noted in vesicle motility could potentially arise from ShcD - induced alterations to any of these targets . A chance observation during a phosphotyrosine screen of asynchronous COS - 1 cells identified that microtubules or their associated proteins may be relevant ShcD associates . As shown in Figure 5 . 3B , a cell that appeared to be captured near the end of telophase / cytokinesis contained a halo of ShcD that roughly surrounded the nuclear material . Coincident with that pattern was an intense phosphotyrosine signal , indicating that either ShcD itself was phosphorylated , or that it co - 104 localized with another phosphorylated factor . The ShcD / pY profile appeared to outline a putative spindle apparatus , and may also suggest a contractile ring . This was the first indication that ShcD might interact more directly with cytoskeletal components . As we had previously determined that the ShcD - EGFR complex accumulates in the perinuclear space , including the presumed centrosomal region , we decided to further evaluate the microtubular architecture in the presence of ShcD . Representative images of an α – tubulin stain of ShcD - and GFP - expressing cells are shown in Figure 5 . 3C . Asterisks indicate the appearance of well - developed centrosomes . There are several notable features of the ShcD cell depicted in this figure . Although ShcD is shown to localize to the region that would typically give rise to the centrosome , there is no visible evidence of a central microtubule organizing centre ( MTOC ) in this cell . Moreover , the microtubule network appears somewhat more disorganized than that of the surrounding cells , and the GFP control . This phenotype was not apparent in all ShcD expressers , so in attempt to quantify the association , we scored more than 20 cells of each transfected denomination on the binary , qualitative characteristic of displaying an apparent centrosome . Figure 5 . 3D shows that , by our estimation , 80 % of ShcD cells were found to lack an obvious central MTOC , as opposed to only 46 % of GFP expressers . The functional significance of this disparity was pursued by subjecting cells to the microtubule depolymerizing agent , colcemid , and documenting their recovery , as previously described ( 200 ) . If ShcD adversely affects centrosome function and organization , delays or defects in microtubule re - polymerization would be anticipated in these cells . The poorly demarcated microtubules of a ShcD expressing cell are evident in the pre - treatment images of Figure 5 . 3E . Strikingly , colcemid challenge accentuated the pericentriolar localization of ShcD . However , ShcD did not appear to impede the process of microtubule re - polymerization , and indeed the architecture observed after the 60 min recovery was more refined than that of the pre - treatment cells . Therefore , although wildtype ShcD is often observed in the pericentriolar region , and ShcD - AD expressing cells demonstrate decreased vesicle motility , further investigation will be required to determine whether microtubules are mechanistically involved with ShcD . 105 Figure 5 . 3 . ShcD trafficking defects are multifactorial , and may involve the cytoskeleton . ( A ) COS - 1 cells transfected with ShcD - AD were introduced to 100 ng / ml of EGF Alexa Fluor - 555 , and immediately loaded into a heated imaging chamber for live cell analysis . 10 images of each channel were acquired per minute , and representative time points are shown . The boxed region demarcated in the top row is provided in magnification in the right - hand column . An imageJ microscopy plugin was used to generate a 3D surface plot to depict the gamma intensity 106 profile of the red channel . A ShcD - AD cell and a neighbouring non - transfectant ( NTF ) were analyzed 20 min after EGF administration . ( B ) A ShcD - expressing cell stained for total phosphotyrosine was captured in the process of division . ( C ) Transfected cells were stained for α - Tubulin to examine the cytoskeletal structure . Asterisks demonstrate regions of visible , well - developed MTOCs . ( D ) 46 ShcD and 24 GFP - expressing cells were visually scored based on the presence or absence of an apparent centrosome . Fisher’s exact test was performed on the resulting proportions ( P = 0 . 0059 ) . ( E ) To further assess microtubule architecture , transfected cells were treated with 0 . 5 µg / ml colcemid for 60 min , rinsed , fixed at the indicated time points ( in minutes ) during recovery , and stained for α - Tubulin . Scale bars = 20 µm . 5 . 2 . 4 Pursuing an oxidative stress hypothesis of ShcD behaviour Over the course of our investigations , it had become apparent that ShcD exerts a profound influence over EGFR that alters the trajectory of both proteins . In seeking mechanistic explanations of this non - canonical behaviour , we turned to the established paradigms of ligand - independent EGFR signalling to determine whether any existing models could account for the cellular behaviours we were documenting . In particular , we identified oxidative stress - mediated EGFR activation as a candidate of interest , as explained briefly in Section 4 . 3 . Similarities between the two phenotypes include phosphorylation of the EGFR on only a subset of tyrosine residues , delayed trafficking through the cell , and perinuclear accumulation of the receptor ( 142 ) . We and others also reported previously that the ShcD CH2 region contains some of the features that endow p66 ShcA with ROS - responsive properties , although their function in ShcD remains unclear ( 45 , 218 ) . Our intention was therefore to validate the redox EGFR activation model within our experimental framework , and then apply it to the study of EGFR - ShcD to determine whether oxidative stress was an underlying factor . As the vast majority of experiments investigating EGFR - ROS interplay have used epidermal keratinocytes and airway epithelial cells , the immediate priority was to determine whether it was even conceivable that the redox environment could influence EGFR in COS - 1 cells . To that end , we exposed non - transfected COS - 1 cells to 1 mM of H 2 O 2 over a 120 min period , and examined the extent and subcellular location of phosphorylated EGFR . Actin was 107 co - stained to demarcate cellular boundaries . We found that hydrogen peroxide treatment did indeed activate the EGFR in this cell line , however , it generated a distinctive pattern of pY1068 staining that was not typical of ligand or ShcD exposure ( Figure 5 . 4A ) . Phospho - EGFR was largely diffuse , with a spherical area of concentration near the nucleus . We also probed for both total - and phospho - Erk prior to and following hydrogen peroxide immersion , but detected no compelling changes ( Figure 5 . 4B ) . Satisfied that the H 2 O 2 model was applicable to COS - 1 cells , we next introduced ShcD into the system to assess the consequences of exposing the adaptor , and its network , to an oxidizing environment . Figure 5 . 4C clearly shows that the ShcD - induced phenotype prevailed over the ROS phenotype after 15 min of hydrogen peroxide . Notably though , the phospho - EGFR signal that co - localized with ShcD appeared to be more intense following treatment than in the unmanipulated controls . This pilot experiment thus demonstrates the capacity for ROS to enhance the existing pattern of ShcD - induced EGFR activation . In order to further investigate the possibility that ShcD - mediated EGFR activation was driven by localized generation of ROS , we sought to employ antioxidants as diagnostic tools . Butylated hydroxyanisole ( BHA ) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) were selected based on their previous use in similar applications ( 151 ) , and we first subjected them to a proof - of - principle assay to confirm their capacity to counteract the effects of hydrogen peroxide on non - transfected COS - 1 cells . As shown in Figure 5 . 4D and E , increasing concentrations of BHA and PDTC were incubated with ROS - stimulated cells and controls , and the total level of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was evaluated by Western blot . Contrary to expectations , antioxidant treatment appeared to further promote EGFR phosphorylation instead of reversing it . PDTC and BHA were deemed inappropriate for further use at these working concentrations , as they were not positioned to offer meaningful insight into ShcD cellular dynamics . To circumvent the limitations of this system , and approach the question from a related angle , we turned our attention to phosphatases . As the major opposition to cellular kinases , these enzymes are key regulatory components of transduction cascades , and have a demonstrated sensitivity to oxidative stress ( 155 ) . Receptor - type Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Kappa ( RPTP - κ ) has been found to counteract both stimulus - induced and basal state phosphorylation of the EGFR ( 153 ) . To test its utility in our system , we introduced FLAG - tagged RPTP - κ to COS - 1 cells , and monitored the phosphotyrosine signal before and after ligand 108 exposure . As Figure 5 . 4F depicts , the transfected phosphatase was unable to modulate EGFR phosphorylation in either the resting or stimulated states . We also evaluated an antibody against RPTP - κ with the hope of using it to screen cell lines and tissues for the protein , but the antibody failed to detect the positive control ( which had been validated via sequencing ) and instead produced a rogue band . Further investigation thus awaits appropriate tool optimization and development . Thus far , attempts to evaluate potential ROS involvement in the ShcD phenotype have focused on the downstream consequences of oxidative stress , instead of its potential sources or mediators . It is therefore of interest to consider how ShcD might generate or harness redox stress to drive EGFR activation . We and others have noted key similarities between the CH2 regions of ShcD and p66 ShcA ( 45 , 218 ) , which we have identified as prime candidates for ROS - responsive elements . We thus used site - directed mutagenesis to strategically ablate the motifs , in order to evaluate the cellular phenotypes of the compromised proteins . As we reported in Chapter 1 , ShcD S55 is a potential analog of p66 ShcA residue S36 , which sustains stress - induced phosphorylation that targets it to the mitochondrion ( 50 ) . We generated a ShcD S55A mutant that cannot undergo phosphorylation . ShcD C84 has been considered equivalent to ShcA p66 C59 , which forms intermolecular disulfide bridges with other CH2 regions to facilitate p66 tetramerization . This in turn primes the protein to generate ROS and initiate PCD ( 45 ) . Our ShcD C84S variant cannot form disulfide bridges from this site . Pilot analyses revealed that the individual ShcD mutants failed to prevent EGFR activation , as shown in Figure 5 . 4G . However , the cellular responses to these proteins should be carefully scrutinized for evidence of subtle tyrosine modulation , and consequences on trafficking patterns . 109 110 Figure 5 . 4 . Oxidative stress induces EGFR phosphorylation in COS - 1 cells . ( A ) Non - transfected COS - 1 cells were treated with H 2 O 2 , fixed at the time points given ( in minutes ) , and evaluated for actin and one of EGFR pY1068 , ( B ) pErk , or Erk . ( C ) ShcD - expressing cells were likewise stimulated with H 2 O 2 and stained for EGFR pY1068 . ( D ) Non - transfectants were stimulated with 600 µM H 2 O 2 and counter - treated with increasing concentrations of the antioxidants BHA or ( E ) PDTC , and probed for total phosphotyrosine . ( F ) FLAG - tagged RPTP - κ was introduced to cells that were then treated with 50 ng / ml EGF or left unstimulated . ( G ) Detection of the overexpressed protein was attempted with a RPTP - κ - specific antibody . ( H ) Schematic of ShcD depicting two putative ROS - responsive sites . ( I ) Site directed mutagenesis of WT ShcD ( FLAG and GFP - tagged ) produced ShcD S55A and C84S , both verified by sequencing and Western blot expression . A preliminary screen compared the EGFR phospho - induction capacity of wildtype , FLAG - tagged ShcD with GFP - and FLAG - double tagged mutants . Scale bars = 20 µm . 5 . 2 . 5 Recapitulating EGFR - ShcD synergy in other biological models In a final round of investigations , we set out to identify other systems in which the EGFR - ShcD response could be induced . Having performed most of the characterization in COS - 1 cells , or doubly - transfected HEK 293 , it was of interest to determine whether we were documenting a universal paradigm , or a rogue phenomenon with limited application . Epidermoid carcinoma line A431 was selected as a robust expresser of EGFR ( 132 ) ; the U87 GBM model was chosen for its responsiveness to EGFR signalling , and it relevance to nervous tissue , which is a major site of ShcD expression ( 26 , 28 ) . ShcD - expressing A431 and non - transfected neighbours were assessed for EGFR pY1068 reactivity both before and after stimulation . As shown in Figure 5 . 5A , ShcD was largely diffuse in A431 , and it was not associated with any phosphorylated EGFR prior to EGF treatment . Upon ligand administration , some ShcD appeared to relocate to membrane ruffles where it co - localized with pEGFR . In the U87 line , preliminary work demonstrated that a phospho EGFR signal was undetectable following stimulation ( data not shown ) , so EGFR was introduced to this line via transfection . Cells are depicted in Figure 5 . 5B in the serum - deprived state . In the presence of 111 EGFR or ShcD alone , cells commonly appeared to adopt a slender bipolar morphology ; ShcD was found to be diffuse , and phospho - EGFR was negligible . However , the co - expression of EGFR and ShcD prompted a considerable morphological change characterized by a loss of polar extensions and an increase in cell body size . EGFR was phosphorylated at residue Y1068 , and found to co - localize with ShcD near the nucleus . These conflicting results demonstrate that although the ShcD - induced phenotype is not universal , there are physiologically relevant circumstances under which it is provoked . Figure 5 . 5 . Opposite responses of two cancer models to ShcD overexpression ( A ) A431 cells were subject to ShcD transfection , EGF stimulation , and 10 min chase , followed by an EGFR pY1068 stain . ( B ) U87 cells transfected with EGFR , ShcD , or both , were analyzed in serum - deprived conditions for EGFR pY1068 . Scale bars = 20 µm . 112 5 . 3 Discussion In a series of truly exploratory investigations , we have demonstrated both promising leads and false starts in the quest to characterize the impact of ShcD on the cell . The work touches on diverse aspects of ShcD function , including signalling output , localization and trafficking , models of activation , and physiological relevance . Although not all findings are definitive , these lines of inquiry provide a useful framework on which to structure ongoing investigations . 5 . 3 . 1 ShcD mediates Erk suppression The ShcD - induced uncoupling of Erk from EGF that we observed via microscopy is uncommon among canonical Shc proteins , though it is in line with our discovery that ShcD sequesters EGFR within the cell , as described in Chapter 4 . It would appear that by removing the receptor from the membrane , ShcD effectively reduces the sensitivity of the cell to exogenous factors . This outcome also agrees with our observations of other RTKs , which likewise demonstrate muted Erk signalling in the presence of ShcD , although the mechanisms are likely distinct ( Wills et al . , manuscript in preparation ) . The disparity between the Western blot ( Figure 3 . 5A ) and microscopy ( Figure 5 . 1 ) is anticipated to be a product of the diluting effect of transient transfection when endogenous and exogenous species are compared . As Western blots report the average output of all cells in the lysate , a system in which DNA uptake and / or expression is less than 100 % efficient is inherently biased toward the native proteins . Although the results presented in Figure 3 . 5A are accurate according to the circumstances described , the findings depicted in Figure 5 . 1 report the actual conditions at the level of single cells , thereby allowing us to integrate more contextual information and parse out divisive data . The success of this approach in detecting an otherwise overlooked phenomenon suggests that alternative strategies are warranted in the ongoing search for ShcD - relevant effectors . This type of analysis could be extended to evaluate the involvement of the stress - activated protein kinases ( SAPKs ) JNK and p38 , which are more typically involved in growth factor - independent , stress - mediated cascades , and STATs , which are often associated with EGFR oncogenesis ( 231 ) . 113 Interestingly , there is at present no consensus in the literature on the role of ShcD in the MAPK pathway , and indeed signalling outcomes appear to be highly contextual . ShcD is believed to bolster Erk phosphorylation distal to the neurotrophin receptor TrkB ( 193 ) and downstream of EGFR in select melanoma cells ( 27 ) . In other melanoma models , however , Erk operates entirely independently of ShcD , and is not involved in the migratory phenotype elicited by the adaptor ( 27 ) . Moreover , genetic ablation of ShcD in embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) has been associated with enhanced Erk phosphorylation during the transition to epiblast stem cells ( EpiSCs ) that occurs early in the neural induction process ( 222 ) . It would thus appear that cellular circumstances define whether ShcD stimulates or represses MAPK . 5 . 3 . 2 EGFR - ShcD synergy dictates localization Although COS - 1 cells have proven to be an invaluable model of endogenous EGFR signalling , one limitation is that the receptor is omnipresent . The HEK 293T line provides an alternative platform into which EGFR can be introduced , and therefore experimentally manipulated . Evaluating the distributions of EGFR and ShcD individually and together is conceptually enlightening , as it helps to define the drivers of localization , and distinguish responses that may instead be artifacts of the expression system . For example , it is conceivable that if one protein stalls at a stage in the biosynthetic pathway , its binding partner ( s ) may arbitrarily recruit to that site not because of its biological significance , but due to the unforeseen experimental confound . It is therefore interesting to note that in the absence of EGFR , the distribution of ShcD is similar to the classic cytosolic presentation of ShcA in the resting state . Indeed , the subcellular localization of singly - expressed EGFR and ShcD are distinct from that of the double - transfectant . Thus , the appearance of ShcD - and EGFR - positive vesicles , often in the nuclear vicinity , seems to be an emergent phenomenon incited by the co - expression of both proteins . Our attempts to determine the utility of the active EGFR kinase domain in maintaining the unique subcellular distribution were largely foiled by technical difficulty . In light of these limitations , an alternative approach would involve the use of tailored EGFR mutations that strategically eliminate either the catalytic function of the kinase ( EGFR K721A ) ( 232 ) or the ShcD binding site ( EGFR Y1148F ) . The consequences of ShcD co - expression could then be 114 assessed in a model cell line that lacks intrinsic EGFR expression , but is a validated platform for the EGFR - ShcD interaction when the proteins are introduced . One disadvantage of a technique that uses a non - native EGFR cell line and relies on transfection of all components of interest is that the response may be less authentic than that elicited by endogenous circuits . Therefore , a two - pronged approach employing an overexpression system such as EGFR - negative Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cells , in parallel with pharmacological inhibition of EGFR in COS - 1 cell with the simultaneous monitoring of phospho - and total EGFR , should help to address concerns . Presently , the forces that drive and sustain the very distinctive EGFR - ShcD co - localization observed in serum - deprived cells via confocal microscopy remain mysterious . 5 . 3 . 3 CME - competent ShcD retains trafficking defects Previously , we characterized ShcD - AD as a chimeric construct that exhibits aspects of ShcA ( EGF uptake ) and ShcD ( EGFR activation ) behaviour . Now , we report that Shc - AD offers an incomplete rescue that restores the cellular acquisition of ligand , but fails to mobilize EGF and its receptor in a traditional manner through the endomembrane system . In this respect , the chimera appears to highlight the distinction between endocytic uptake and subsequent trafficking , which may reflect the switch from actin - mediated dynamics at the cortex , to minus - end - directed tubulin motility ( 230 ) . Whether there is a mechanistic link to tubulin remains to be seen , although ShcD is often found near sites of microtubule nucleation . It should be noted that there is no existing precedent for Shc proteins to interact with microtubules , although roles for Shc in the actin cytoskeleton have been uncovered ( 35 , 184 , 233 ) . In general , the roles of Shc proteins in endocytosis and vesicular trafficking remain poorly characterized , no doubt in part because the discipline is complex , and the systems under study appear to contain a considerable amount of built - in redundancy , which makes it challenging to identify the basic requirements . In addition to performing a more thorough assessment of ShcD in this context , it is likewise advisable to expand on the existing analysis of ShcA . Our lab has developed ShcA - Δ AD for this purpose . Like ShcD , it lacks the adaptin binding motif entirely , and can be used in parallel with ShcD to address questions of endocytosis . In turn , these could be combined with other selectively mutagenized pathway components to generate a more holistic understanding of endocytic determinants . 115 5 . 3 . 4 The EGFR responds to oxidative stress In working with ShcD , we are faced with the unique challenge of having to explain how a non - catalytic adaptor protein appears to actively orchestrate a major signalling node . Without any mechanistic leads , we turned to the structure of ShcD and the wealth of knowledge on EGFR , and determined that oxidative stress could potentially connect the two components . From that theoretical foundation , we have verified that EGFR is a target of ROS in COS - 1 cells . Previously , our microscopy demonstrated that when EGFR is pre - clustered with ShcD and sequestered within the cell , it is not available to exogenous ligand . In this respect , the programmes of ligand - mediated vs . ligand - independent EGFR transduction are mutually exclusive . This is not the case with hydrogen peroxide , which can enter the cell through passive diffusion and aquaporins ( 234 ) irrespective of whether EGFR is situated at the plasma membrane . Thus , hydrogen peroxide offers the unique potential to ‘co - stimulate’ an EGF receptor that is already otherwise engaged . We have exploited this capacity , and report from our preliminary findings that oxidative stress appears to marginally enhance the phosphorylation of ShcD - associated EGFR . Moving forward , it will be of interest to determine how the redox environment differs between regions with and without ShcD , and whether / how the adaptor is mechanistically implicated in the cellular ROS equilibrium . Investigations should include both a direct readout of hydrogen peroxide production , as offered by commercial fluorescent probes , as well as the demonstrable quenching capacity of antioxidants , or the enzyme catalase , which catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide . We have also developed two constructs , ShcD S55A and ShcD C84S that hypothetically disable two putative ROS - responsive regions believed to be homologous with p66 ShcA . As our pilot investigations into ROS and EGFR were concluding , another group published the discovery that hydrogen peroxide can drive ShcD to the nucleus , from which it can escape using a nuclear export signal ( NES ) ( 235 ) . Encouragingly , their reported NES contains the cysteine that we had chosen to modify , suggesting that our instincts may be correct . 116 5 . 3 . 5 ShcD and EGFR interact in a model of Glioblastoma Through screening an assortment of cell models for EGFR - ShcD synergy , we have identified subsets that are capable and incapable of generating the phenotype that we initially reported in the COS - 1 line . Among those that do invoke the response are HEK 293 ( Chapter 3 ) , CHO ( data not shown ) , and U87 ( Figure 5 . 5B ) . HEK 293T demonstrated evidence of EGFR - ShcD co - localization ( Figure 5 . 2A ) , but as the EGFR auto - activated in this line , ShcD - induced EGFR hyperphosphorylation could not be assessed . Cells for which the association could not be demonstrated include N19 oligodendrocytes ( data not shown ) and A431 ( Figure 5 . 5A ) . One caveat is that these conclusions apply only to the specific conditions under which the receptor and adaptor were analyzed ; we presently do not know the instigating factors that establish the EGFR - ShcD synergy , and whether they are sensitive to environmental fluctuation . Nevertheless , Figure 5 . 5 presents an interesting juxtaposition of two cancer cell lines that represent the two poles of ShcD response . Understanding the differences between these cell models could further illuminate the mechanism of ShcD induced EGFR activation , whether it be the result of absolute levels of EGFR , the redox environment , or the presence of another interaction partner such as a phosphatase . 117 CHAPTER 6 : PERSPECTIVES 118 6 . 1 Surveying the ShcD landscape In 2007 , a novel protein was introduced to the scientific community as ShcD / 4 , thereby setting the precedent that it was yet another phosphotyrosine adaptor of a well - characterized family . Contrary to that assumption , the work described herein portrays ShcD in a very different light . Certainly , ShcD exhibits many hallmarks of the standard transduction adaptor , from its architecture and recruitment to activated RTKs , to its Grb2 binding properties . However , in the context of the classic EGFR transduction cascades , we have failed to substantiate claims that ShcD facilitates canonical signalling . Conversely , our observations overwhelmingly suggest that that ShcD occupies a unique and unprecedented niche in the regulation and destiny of EGFR . To our knowledge , we have provided the first evidence of a non - catalytic protein that promotes EGFR activation in the absence of ligand . This cell - autonomous response is unique to ShcD , and not conserved across the adaptor family . We have identified three principal EGFR motifs ( Y1068 , Y1148 , and Y1173 ) that are subject to ShcD - induced phosphorylation , while residue Y1045 , a key c - Cbl binding site , appears to remain unmodified . The phosphorylation of both EGFR and ShcD is sensitive to a specific EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , but not to Src inhibition , implying that EGFR is prompted to auto - phosphorylate . While the ShcD PTB domain is also required to induce EGFR activation , the six central tyrosine residues of the CH1 are dispensable . In parallel , this biochemical change is accompanied by a drastic relocation of the EGFR from the membrane to intracellular vesicles , which often accumulate in the nuclear vicinity . Here , EGFR and ShcD co - localize in a pattern that is not native to either of the individually expressed proteins . Under these circumstances , the cell is rendered less sensitive to exogenous stimulus , as reflected by its reduced acquisition of ligand , and failure to engage the Erk cascade . EGF uptake can be restored by inserting the ShcA AP2 adaptin binding motif into the analogous region of ShcD , however this chimeric protein exhibits signs of delayed motility in the cell that may suggest an additional microtubule - based trafficking defect . At the level of cell and organismal physiology , ShcD - mediated , ligand - independent activation of the EGFR appears to promote wound - induced cell migration . In the U87 GBM model , overexpressed EGFR and ShcD demonstrate the same phenotypic characteristics that we document in the COS - 1 line , in addition to changing the basic morphology of the cell . 119 Intriguingly , we have used qPCR to quantitate transcript levels of ShcD mRNA in resected astrocytomas of varying grades , and found it to be upregulated on average . This corresponds with an increase in phospho - activated EGFR detected on histological tumour sections . We have thus uncovered an intriguing foundation for future investigations with potential relevance that extends from basic cell physiology , to human disease . Over the course of these discoveries , the experimental workflow has transitioned from general effector screens to hypothesis - driven evaluations . Many details remain to be determined , and ultimately assembled into a model of EGFR - ShcD synergy that can address both the mechanistic underpinnings of a seemingly divergent response , and the physiological ramifications of this unique molecular collaboration . Investigations are ongoing to provide incrementally finer resolution of the biochemical landscape that enables a putative adaptor protein to facilitate ligand - independent , cell - autonomous EGFR activation , MAPK signal quenching , and perinuclear sequestration . 6 . 2 Models and mechanisms : seeking the subversive tactics of ShcD Although there remain relatively few publications on the subject of ShcD itself , the extensive EGFR and Shc family literature provide a conceptual framework for exploring a phenotype that has , to date , defied explanation . The goal in determining mechanism is to dissect a complex response into its simplest conceptual elements , and the corresponding sequence of events that gives rise to the greater phenotype . While we have identified some basic requirements for EGFR - ShcD synergy , including the intrinsic EGFR tyrosine kinase and the ShcD PTB domain , the precise nature of their orchestration remains elusive . Presently , it is not even clear whether there is one unifying origin for the various outputs we observe , or whether the phenotype results from several independent factors that are individually set in motion when ShcD is co - expressed with EGFR . Thus , it remains to be seen whether EGFR activation is in fact the foundational change from which trafficking anomalies arise . Questions of how and why EGFR and ShcD synergize to activate the receptor and remove it from the plasma membrane become more tractable in the face of decades worth of investigation into the nature of non - canonical signalling . With comparatively little known about ShcD , mechanistic analyses are rooted in the existing knowledge of EGFR infrastructure and divergent Shc signalling . 120 Within the current framework , the story of ShcD is , in many respects , the story of EGFR structure - function relationships , and the underappreciated potential of the Shc family to engage in context - dependent signalling , switch mechanisms , and environmental integration . 6 . 2 . 1 Basic biochemical requirements The fundamental question of how a non - catalytic adaptor protein can facilitate activation of a major RTK lies at the heart of the ShcD enigma . While we have revealed the basic requirement for both the ShcD PTB domain and the intrinsic EGFR kinase to elicit receptor hyperphosphorylation , we have not demonstrated that these components alone are sufficient to drive the phenotype . It is possible , for example , that the role of the PTB domain in this context is to tether ShcD to the EGFR and place it in proximity of the catalytic core . In such a scenario , the PTB domain could be considered an accomplice to a yet - to - be identified ShcD motif that influences EGFR enzymatic activity . Thus , it would be premature to ascribe kinase regulatory functions to the ShcD PTB domain , despite our findings that it is essential for ShcD - induced , ligand - independent activation of the EGFR . Evaluation of the synergistic phenotype in the presence of the isolated ShcD PTB domain could begin to resolve this outstanding conundrum . Likewise , employing a mutant of EGFR that lacks Y1148 , the key ShcD binding site , could identify whether there is a requirement for interaction . Just as there may be additional features within the EGFR and ShcD proteins that facilitate their atypical union , there may likewise be companion molecules in the cell that collaborate to execute the outcomes that we document . Indeed , it is presently unknown whether ShcD is a direct mediator of the EGFR , or whether there is a more extensive interactome involved in eliciting receptor phosphorylation . If the influence of ShcD over EGFR is direct , the synergistic effect of their co - expression could be recapitulated in a cell - free system using purified EGFR and ShcD in the presence of ATP . The resulting in vitro EGFR phosphorylation profile would then provide a biochemical foundation for our phenotype that is currently lacking from our characterization efforts . As we have identified the EGFR kinase as a requirement in the phenotype , the simplest model of direct induction would involve ShcD circumventing intrinsic EGFR regulatory strategies in order to overcome mechanisms that oppose basal state phosphorylation . Under this hypothesis , ShcD would provoke a stimulatory conformational change in the receptor through 121 physical interaction . Considering the EGFR structure - function relationships discussed in Chapter 1 , ShcD could have a role in regulating the EGFR intracellular region by destabilizing the inactive , c - Src - like conformation ( Section 1 . 2 . 2 ) and thereby promoting asymmetric dimerization of adjacent kinase domains . This is the EGFR activation strategy invoked by the L834R mutation , which is commonly found in lung cancers ( 122 ) , and can also arise from changes rendered to the carboxy terminus ( 137 ) . Conversely , the cytoplasmic protein MIG6 has been found to interact directly with the EGFR kinase domain and block the dimerization interface , thereby inhibiting the receptor ( 236 ) . Amino - terminally adjacent to the EGFR kinase , the juxtamembrane region allosterically influences catalytic activity , and contains sites of post - translational modification that can modulate the enzyme ( 65 ) . Among the consensus motifs identified in this segment are those for PKC ( T654 ) ( 65 ) , and Erk ( T669 ) ( 72 ) , which enable the receptor to integrate multiple sources of feedback to determine parameters such as the extent of phosphorylation and cellular trajectory . To date , the only cytosolic non - kinase proteins that have been implicated directly in EGFR activation are the cytohesin family of GEFs ( 221 ) . These proteins operate independently of their nucleotide exchange function to boost receptor autophosphorylation . They are believed to act on existing EGFR dimers to elicit a conformational change in the cytoplasmic domains of the receptors , although the precise nature of the shift is unknown ( 221 ) . Collectively , these findings reinforce the sensitivity of EGFR to chemical and physical alterations induced through direct interaction with cellular constituents . They also highlight the existence of several regions within the EGFR that are particularly susceptible to regulatory modification , and could conceivably be subject to ShcD control . Indeed , pending biochemical and structural analysis , ShcD may yet be included in the small repertoire of factors that exerts direct influence over the EGFR kinase . However , despite the elegance of a simple structural model of EGFR - ShcD synergy , there is some suggestion that the interaction between the two proteins in the pre - liganded state is not direct , despite the observation that the ShcD PTB domain is required to facilitate EGFR hyperphosphorylation . This would thereby implicate third party mediators in at least some aspects of the phenotype . While our confocal microscopy demonstrates remarkable co - localization of the proteins in perinuclear vesicles under serum - deprived conditions , 122 immunoprecipitations have thus far failed to capture an association between EGFR and ShcD in the absence of ligand . While this may relate to the limitations of the Western blot workflow that were discussed in Section 5 . 3 . 1 , we must also consider the possibility that ShcD is not physically required to couple with EGFR in order to influence the receptor , although it clearly remains in close proximity . There is the additional conundrum of the observed context - dependency of ShcD - induced EGFR auto - activation . The inability of endogenous EGF receptors in A431 cells to undergo ShcD - induced phosphorylation , as depicted in Section 5 . 2 . 5 suggests that either a mediating factor is absent in this line , or that a higher - order regulatory mechanism is present and opposes the actions of ShcD . Both scenarios underscore the importance of taking into account the complex and heterogeneous cell environment when making mechanistic prognostications . In Section 6 . 2 . 3 , we further consider the potential roles for facilitator molecules in EGFR - ShcD synergy . Ultimately , there is currently no definitive evidence that EGFR auto - activation is a direct and fundamental biochemical property of ShcD . While it is clear that precedents exist for cytosolic regulation of the EGFR kinase , additional investigation is required to determine whether ShcD satisfies this model . 6 . 2 . 2 Cellular phenotypic characterization The second major unexpected discovery to arise from our work was the profound change in EGFR localization elicited by ShcD , and the resulting impact on cellular ligand sensitivity . Unlike receptor phosphorylation , which can potentially be reduced to a chemical reaction in a defined system , changes in trafficking patterns are emergent phenomena of the cell as a whole . They involve orchestration across many levels , from the endocytic machinery that recruits specific cargo into developing vesicles , to the microtubule infrastructure that carries endosomes away from the cortex , and the ESCRT proteins that sort the content and determine its destiny . It is therefore a high priority to continue cell - based analysis of ShcD and its impact on these fundamental transactions . 123 One of the hallmarks of EGFR - ShcD synergy is the accumulation of both proteins in the juxtanuclear region . This has occasioned much speculation about the significance of this location , the functions that EGFR and / or ShcD may fulfil there , and the process by which the proteins arrive and depart . It is of interest to determine , for example , whether ligand - independent coupling of EGFR and ShcD occur at the membrane , and if so , which endocytic pathway removes EGFR from the surface . The question of receptor fate necessarily involves the study of receptor ubiquitylation , potential recycling pathways , receptor half - life , and the identity of the compartment in which ShcD and EGFR become sequestered . Moreover , it is of renewed interest to re - screen ShcD expressing cells for proximal effectors , to identify subtle modulation that may have been overlooked in the original characterization . It is tempting to speculate that ShcD - induced EGFR phosphorylation itself drives receptor internalization and intracellular accumulation . This type of outcome has been documented as a result of oxidative stress challenge ( discussed in Section 1 . 2 . 2 . 3 ) and in the presence of activated Src ( 237 ) . Intriguingly , these scenarios all involve ligand - independent phosphorylation of the EGFR , perinuclear accumulation of the receptor , and avoidance of lysosomal degradation . It has been proposed that the lack of phosphorylation on the EGFR c - Cbl binding site , Y1045 , confers protection from a destructive fate ( 160 ) , which in turn raises the compelling possibility that the receptor phosphorylation pattern could encode the cellular trajectory . Nevertheless , our direct attempts to determine whether ShcD - mediated autophosphorylation of EGFR is a prerequisite for internalization have thus far been inconclusive ( Section 5 . 2 . 2 ) . However , the observation that the CME - competent Shc - AD chimera retains its capacity to activate EGFR , but partitions the receptor differently between the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles suggests that there may be multiple factors involved in defining the ShcD phenotype . An additional and unintended outcome of this detailed characterization is the potential of our extensive catalogue of ShcD mutants to themselves become tools in the study of cellular endocytic paradigms . The discovery that EGFR can be redistributed by introducing the AP2 motif to ShcD has raised questions about the utility of a region that has been largely disregarded . After it was previously determined to offer only minimal modulation of EGFR uptake ( 101 ) , the AP2 motif appears to have been abandoned as subject of investigation in the 124 context of Shc proteins . Nevertheless , a growing appreciation for the inherent redundancy in endocytic mechanism , as well as our suggestion that this motif may have broader functionality than initially appreciated , could potentially revive the study of its contributions . Thus , although we are principally evaluating a non - canonical phenotype , elements of our discoveries may yet inform aspects of conventional EGFR biology . Ultimately , understanding the full cellular impact of ShcD - mediated EGFR regulatory subversion will require a robust concept not only of the unique properties of this complex , but also of the traditional EGFR pathways that are suppressed in the presence of ShcD . Our characterization will benefit from ongoing efforts to reconcile the contentious roles of ligand gradients , ubiquitin , and clathrin as they concern endocytic mechanism and receptor fate . 6 . 2 . 3 Defining the interactome As the preceding discussions contend , all indications suggest that the complete cellular EGFR - ShcD phenotype that we have described arises from the concerted activity of several molecular contributors . Although the number and nature of these components remain subject to speculation , it is of interest to characterize the interaction network that orchestrates ShcD deviance . Broadly speaking , many layers of integration could be involved , including proximal mediators , distal effectors , and overarching regulatory components . It is presently not known whether receptor hyperphosphorylation , which is the most steadfastly biochemical of the EGFR - ShcD traits , arises from direct or indirect interplay between the two proteins . Thus , functional partners may already be involved in this basic level of phenotypic induction . But what in the proteome would be capable of facilitating a stimulatory association between EGFR and ShcD ? As suggested in Chapter 5 , phosphatases are an attractive target in the regulatory landscape of EGFR , as they oppose both basal and ligand - induced phosphorylation ( 153 ) . Indeed , part of the canonical signalling response involves temporary inhibition of phosphatases in order to allow signal propagation ( 158 ) . The regulatory enzymes must then resume their functions to resolve the transduction and reset phosphorylated intermediates . As described in Section 1 . 1 . 4 , several phosphatases are known to associate with the ShcA PTB domain , where they exert a context - specific influence over the CH1 region tyrosine residues . It is possible that perhaps ShcD engages in PTB - mediated interactions with one of the companion phosphatases of the EGFR , maintaining it in an inactive state . This could 125 potentially give rise to the context - dependency that we observe with the EGFR - ShcD phenotype , as phosphatase expression differs across cell types . Thus , if the ShcD influence is limited to select regulatory nodes , there will be models in which the adaptor has no influence , as we have shown in the case of A431 cells ( Section 5 . 2 . 5 ) . Indeed , as ShcD analyses progress , it will be critical to consider how this adaptor is positioned within the existing regulatory framework of the cell . This includes defining its various sources of input and output – namely , the types of upstream stimuli that direct ShcD , and the downstream effectors that could become its targets . There are several potential methods by which biochemical information could be conveyed to ShcD , and we will consider the inorganic environment separately in the next Section ( 6 . 2 . 4 ) . As discussed in Chapter 1 , p66 ShcA possesses a unique phosphorylation site , S36 , which has striking and divergent roles in cell physiology . In the context of EGFR signalling , MAPK - induced phosphorylation of this motif uncouples the receptor from Ras , thereby quenching the Erk response ( 86 , 87 ) Under different circumstances , phosphorylation of S36 by PKC β generates a consensus recognition sequence for Pin1 , which ultimately primes p66 for mitochondrial uptake and PCD ( 50 ) . We have identified that an analogous site , S55 , exists in the CH2 region of ShcD , although to date , no tools exist to monitor changes in its phosphorylation . We have , however , developed a ShcD S55A mutant to further define the significance of this residue . It is presently not known how many serine or threonine motifs on ShcD undergo phosphorylation , but considering that post - translational modification of these residues often has regulatory significance , it would be of interest to investigate this further . Similarly , ShcD possesses additional proline - rich regions , and sites of tyrosine phosphorylation , both of which can serve as recognition motifs for proximal effectors bearing SH3 or SH2 domains , respectively . It is well known , for example , that Grb2 plays an essential role in endocytosis ( 238 ) . Considering that ShcD is a multivalent Grb2 adaptor , the possibility exists that the EGFR internalization observed in its presence arises from ShcD - mediated recruitment of Grb2 and its proximal effectors . Thus , ShcD may establish a unique interactome compared to that of a canonical adaptor , and one that is further defined by the proteome of the cell type or physiological condition in question . 126 6 . 2 . 4 Parallels to non - canonical EGFR signalling While we have described a novel avenue by which the classical attributes of EGFR signalling can be hijacked and subverted , it is currently not apparent whether ShcD harnesses an existing paradigm of ligand - independent EGFR activation , or whether it exploits an uncharacterized feature or vulnerability of the receptor . Fortunately , the EGFR has been the subject of intense investigation for over four decades , which allows us to leverage an extensive body of knowledge in the quest to characterize the effects of ShcD on this receptor . This knowledgebase will one day make it possible to compare an EGFR - ShcD - driven transcriptome to the known signatures of EGFR overexpression , oncogenic mutation , and stress response , which will help to identify highly aligned pathways . Likewise , the EGFR literature reinforces that the phenotype documented herein may be significant on a physiological scale , considering the involvement of analogous non - canonical EGFR activation strategies in disease . Below , we consider putative roles for ShcD in the existing framework of non - canonical EGFR signalling . 6 . 2 . 4 . 1 Threshold traits : receptor / adaptor stoichiometry As discussed in Section 1 . 2 . 2 . 1 , the EGFR alone is capable of auto - activating and initiating a distinct genetic programme when it is sufficiently upregulated . In that state , it is also primed to facilitate other processes in the cell , and can be transforming in the presence of another strategic mutation or deletion . In our studies of COS - 1 cells , introducing ShcD to a system with low basal phosphorylation shifted the equilibrium in favour of receptor activation , with no evidence of a corresponding change in the overall protein level . This raises the possibility that ShcD may lower the receptor density threshold required for spurious activation , thereby eliciting a response under conditions of less pronounced EGFR upregulation . This model also suggests that there may be a defined range of receptor concentrations over which ShcD could be influential ; below the lower setpoint , the phenotype would not be invoked , and above the higher one , EGFR may operate on an independent agenda . In turn , this window of opportunity could be cell type specific , and established or influenced by members of the previously described interactome . In terms of testing this conjecture , the transcription factor IRF3 is differentially activated under conditions of ligand - or density - dependent EGFR activation ( 136 ) , and therefore could be utilized as readout of the contributions of this pathway to the ShcD - induced phenotype . 127 Overall , it seems quite conceivable that the absolute concentrations of the receptor and adaptor , or their relative stoichiometry , contribute to the phenotypic outcome . However , our findings suggest that this is not the only factor determining whether or not EGFR and ShcD will intermingle . Under normal circumstances , EGFR expression varies between 40 , 000 and 100 , 000 receptors / cell ( 239 ) . By contrast , A431 are estimated to generate 2 million receptors / cell ( 132 ) , while COS are believed to express a much lower level than that ( 107 ) . A simple relationship between EGFR expression and receptor susceptibility to Shc - mediated activation predicts that the phenotype should be most pronounced in A431 cells , not in COS - 1 . However , we have evidence to the contrary . Rather than discrediting the effect of protein concentration , our discovery reinforces the contextual nature of the EGFR - ShcD response . Indeed , it is important to note that the biochemical heterogeneity between A431 and COS - 1 cells extends far beyond the level of receptor expression , and A431 cells are known to exhibit an anomalous response to EGF on account of their exceptionally high EGFR expression levels ( 240 , 241 ) . On a uniform genetic background or a perfectly controlled model , it is entirely possible that we would detect a dose - response phenotype depending on the amount of EGFR and ShcD titrated into the system . If this is indeed the case , it remains to be determined whether the induction trend follows linear rheostat - like behaviour , or a threshold - controlled binary switch model . 6 . 2 . 4 . 2 Oxidative stress and the chemical environment There is a compelling , though presently hypothetical , argument for the central role of oxidative stress in facilitating the EGFR - ShcD phenotype . Accordingly , there is an implicit requirement for ShcD to generate and / or sense ROS such that it can orchestrate this response . p66 ShcA is capable of both stress - responsive signalling alterations in the cytoplasm , and recruitment to the mitochondrion , where it produces additional ROS at the expense of cyt - c . Likewise , diverse environmental stressors , such as UV and cigarette smoke , converge on the cell in the form of hydrogen peroxide , which has a long history of influencing the EGFR ( reviewed in Section 1 . 2 . 2 . 3 ) . Strikingly , the EGFR - ShcD synergy we observe is consistent with aspects of oxidative stress signalling , including the selective phosphorylation of a subset of EGFR tyrosine residues , sustained receptor activation , decreased vesicle motility , and accumulation in a perinuclear compartment ( 142 ) . 128 Until recently , however , it was pure speculation fuelled by tenuous structural homology to suggest that ShcD could potentiate a ROS phenotype in the cell . After we had already embarked on the pilot stages of our oxidative stress assessments to close this knowledge gap , another group demonstrated that ShcD nuclear localization increases in response to exogenous hydrogen peroxide ( 235 ) . They also identified a motif of the CH2 region , 83 - LCTLIPRM - 90 , that functions as a nuclear export signal ( NES ) compatible with the chromosomal region maintenance ( CRM ) export system ( 235 ) . However , it remains unclear how oxidative stress mobilizes a fraction of the ShcD protein to the nucleus , and whether this involves alterations to the NES , or a separate nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) . Strikingly , the cysteine in one of our two putative ROS - responsive motifs , C84 , is the second residue of the newly - identified ShcD NES . In p66 ShcA , this site has been deemed responsible for stress - induced , disulfide - bond mediated tetramerization , and ultimate assembly of a p66 complex in the mitochondrion that participates in ROS generation and apoptosis ( 45 ) . It has been postulated that oxidative stress may likewise promote ShcD dimerization , thereby masking the NES and facilitating nuclear accumulation ( 235 ) . We propose that the ShcD C84 may additionally be a target of ROS - induced sulfenylation , as described above in the context of EGFR . With the development of new probes for this post - translational modification , it has become increasingly feasible to monitor the oxidation of cysteine residues ( 157 ) , which may be informative in the case of ShcD . It should also be noted , however , that the C84S mutation failed to prevent ShcD - induced EGFR activation in our preliminary studies . This implies that if the EGFR hyperphosphorylation is , in fact , redox - mediated , the ROS - response element is more sophisticated than this single oxidizable cysteine . Our findings , coupled with the demonstrated peroxide sensitivity of ShcD , raise the intriguing possibility that ShcD is a redox sensor that initiates an alternative EGFR programme under appropriate environmental conditions . It may likewise be capable of altering the redox environment itself , although the catalytic core of the ShcA p66 CB region has not specifically been identified in ShcD . Its potential to respond to ROS could be addressed in a cell - free system , similar to the setup described in Section 6 . 2 . 1 , that assesses the extent of EGFR phosphorylation in the presence of ShcD and an oxidizing or reducing environment . It is likewise 129 of interest to generate a comparative ROS profile of COS - 1 and other cell types , in order to detect trends in the environment and identify correlations to the EGFR induction status . This analysis could be extended to involve peroxide - challenging cell lines that resist ShcD - mediated EGFR hyperphosphorylation , such as the A431 cells , to determine whether there is a threshold concentration of ROS that stimulates ligand - independent EGFR - ShcD coupling and relocation . Certainly , it is anticipated that cells differ in ROS level and in the extent of their compensatory measures , such as glutathione production . Accordingly , this could account for the contextual nature of EGFR - ShcD synergy . It remains to be determined whether a legitimate mechanistic link can be made between ShcD , EGFR , and ROS , in the lab . Nevertheless , this speculation serves to highlight the often - overlooked importance of the inorganic environment in determining cellular outcomes . 6 . 3 Establishing a physiological niche for ShcD The ultimate objective of the experimental priorities identified throughout Section 6 . 2 is to generate a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of EGFR - ShcD synergy . Yet , in isolation , this detailed blueprint of ShcD circuitry will not address one of the fundamental mysteries of this union – the question of why . From an evolutionary standpoint , what purpose is served by a protein that appears to contradict its homologs ? In what physiological context , encompassing development , maintenance , or disease , would such EGFR - ShcD interplay occur ? Presently lacking from the ShcD narrative is a sense of this bigger picture , and the particular niche that the protein occupies within the cell and the organism . To that end , it is imperative to recognize that the EGFR - ShcD dynamic is likely only a limited facet of a much broader ShcD functional repertoire . This type of synergy may not arise when other receptors are paired with ShcD , or indeed , from the same pairing under different cellular circumstances , as we have demonstrated . Thus , extrapolating from this data to other pathways and rendering broad conclusions about global functional significance are beyond the purview of this work . Nonetheless , any holistic model of ShcD must account for the unconventional potential that we have revealed in this protein , and thereby reconcile reports of the protein’s divergent cellular consequences . In the following sections , we distil elements of unconventional Shc biology that illuminate a putative role for ShcD as a molecular integrator and switch . 130 6 . 3 . 1 Adapting to disease : pathology lessons from the Shc family Although ShcD is unique in its capacity to induce EGFR phosphorylation , other Shc proteins engage in non - canonical behaviour and / or switch - like mechanisms to drive diverse and , at times , contradictory responses . We thus turn to these examples for insight and inspiration as we grapple with the functional significance of this new and enigmatic protein . As described in Section 1 . 4 . 3 , the fate of neuroblastoma in vitro can be determined by the dominant Shc adaptor present , underscoring the impact of nuanced Shc signalling . Here , the duration of Erk activation is pivotal in directing the cell to proliferate or differentiate , and can be uniquely modulated by ShcA and ShcC . The most salient examples of rogue Shc behaviour are found with p66 ShcA , the unusual isoform whose functionality vastly transcends the conventional bounds of a phosphotyrosine adaptor protein . Although it is best characterized as a lifespan determinant and proponent of PCD , p66 makes other cellular contributions that more closely resemble the phenotype that we have observed with ShcD . These case studies are of particular relevance due to the reputed homology that has been identified in the CH2 regions of the two proteins . Indeed , ShcD may share a conserved potential to integrate environmental cues , divert signals , or otherwise direct an obscure agenda . In Chapter 1 , we discussed the propensity of ShcA p66 to uncouple EGFR from downstream targets of the Ras / MAPK cascade , while sequestering Grb2 . Far from being an obscure or irrelevant outcome , this molecular override has been deemed responsible for stress - induced disconnection of EGFR and Erk in renal proximal tubule cells , and following ischemia / reperfusion injury to the kidney , both of which are associated with cellular necrosis ( 87 ) . Strikingly , the uncoupling only occurs under severe oxidative stress , defined in this experimental context as 1 mM H 2 O 2 , and it is not immediate , as Erk activation can initially be detected . In contrast , mild stress ( 0 . 5 mM H 2 O 2 ) both elicits and sustains the canonical , pro - survival EGFR - Erk pathway . The necrotic response requires p66 phosphorylation at S36 by Erk and JNK , and involves SOS1 displacement from the signalling complex . Accordingly , selective ablation of the p66 isoform renders renal cells more resistant to oxidative stress ( 87 ) . This unique involvement of p66 in assimilating environmental information and directing the EGFR response is especially intriguing in light of the broader role of oxidative stress in 131 aberrant signal transduction . In the present scenario , both EGFR and p66 are targets of ROS , and p66 provides an additional layer of control over the receptor under extenuating circumstances . Drawing parallels to ShcD , it is possible to imagine this adaptor performing a broadly analogous role . 6 . 3 . 2 Shc Disturbing : building a case for ShcD as an environmental switch As the characterization of ShcD is still in its infancy , fundamental questions about the nature of this protein are still open for debate . At stake is the basic functional identity of ShcD , and its status within a protein family that appears to abide by many conserved rules and generate few exceptions . Indeed , the designation of ShcD as a dedicated phosphotyrosine adaptor is challenged by observations that defy the basic expectations of such a class of molecule . Chief among the non - canonical features of ShcD is its propensity to engage in ligand - independent associations with EGFR , characterized by receptor phosphoactivation and subcellular relocation . ShcD has also demonstrated an unexpected capacity to respond to atypical stimuli in the form of hydrogen peroxide , which drives it to the nucleus ( 235 ) . However , adaptors are typically regarded as passive signalling components that are recruited to an active receptor , where they provide a physical platform for the developing transduction complex . Their principal role is to respond to receptor phosphorylation , not to initiate it . While these unusual findings do not argue against the possibility of ShcD assuming adaptor roles within the cell , they do assert that ShcD function is not limited to the traditional realm of scaffolding . More support for ShcD multimodality arises from the discovery that our phenotype of interest is not a universal feature of EGFR - ShcD co - expression , and thus cannot be generalized to all scenarios in which the two proteins may interact . To that end , we have documented certain inconsistencies that are challenging to reconcile , including the observation that ligand stimulation of COS - 1 cells is found by western blot to facilitate robust EGFR - ShcD interaction , while confocal microscopy suggests that EGF levels are low in ShcD - expressing cells , and EGFR is largely sequestered away from the plasma membrane . Barring technical confounds , these results imply that even within the COS - 1 system , there may be several distinct trajectories available to the EGFR - ShcD duo . This interpretation is further bolstered by our work with the ShcD - AD chimera , which appears to acquire classical adaptor attributes from an unlikely source 132 – a transplanted recognition motif that enables CME . This appears to constitute evidence that ShcD does possess the capacity to mount a traditional response to ligand stimulus of the EGFR , but only when certain yet - to - be determined conditions are met . Accordingly , others have identified characteristics of ShcD signalling that cannot be recapitulated in our system , including the activation of Erk as a downstream effector ( 27 ) . Assuming that these varying perspectives are valid in their own right , the roles of ShcD appear to be context - dependent , and more diverse than those of the traditional Shc protein . We therefore propose that ShcD is not , in fact , a canonical phosphotyrosine adaptor , nor is it simply a passive participant in cellular transactions . We suggest instead that while ShcD may have the innate potential to serve as a signalling scaffold , it functions in parallel to integrate various environmental cues and actively sculpt the transduction output . Fundamentally , this would render ShcD a regulatory node responsible for assimilating select forms of cellular information and / or conditions , and executing a compatible agenda . Under certain circumstances , as we have demonstrated , this involves removing the EGFR from the traditional signalling pathways entirely . If ShcD is , in essence , a molecular switch , then there must exist corresponding cellular factors that determine whether it is metaphorically ‘on’ or ‘off’ . Commitment to one outcome ( receptor sequestration ) over another ( canonical EGFR signalling ) is not likely to be arbitrary , considering how profoundly it could affect the cell . But what types of cues might drive the ShcD switch ? The preceding sections have described several potential candidates that could serve such a purpose , including receptor density and oxidative stress . Under these models , achieving a predetermined EGFR expression level or ROS burden could be sufficient to define the nature of the intervention that ShcD provides . There also remain many questions about the putative role of upstream partners in modifying cryptic regulatory sites of ShcD , as is found with p66 ShcA . In practice , many of these parameters may in fact collaborate to give rise to the ultimate phenotype . Moving forward in the characterization of ShcD , it will be of utmost importance to transition away from the mindset and experimental workflow that frames ShcD as an obligate , canonical phosphotyrosine adaptor protein . Considerable evidence now positions ShcD in the general realm of p66 ShcA , which makes diverse contributions to the cell , and to organismal physiology in general . 133 6 . 3 . 3 ShcD : angel or demon ? In the ongoing initiative to characterize ShcD , it remains to be seen how this protein manifests in the varying scenarios of development and disease . Efforts are currently underway to identify the deficits associated with murine ShcD genomic knockout , which will provide the first indication of the global morphogenetic impact of the protein . However , this approach cannot identify the specific functions that are lost ; it will only reveal the absence of a critical factor . In the case of ShcD , which is suspected of entertaining several modi operandi , the biochemical nature of any resulting defects will remain obscure until subsequent in vitro work provides increased molecular resolution . In light of our intriguing findings , it is of interest to question not only what ShcD does in the body , but also how this particular EGFR - ShcD synergy is utilized in practice . Does it represent an advantageous response to adverse conditions , or is it a maladaptive collusion that promotes disease ? It is presently not known whether the non - canonical association of EGFR and ShcD is pro - or anti - oncogenic , neither , or perhaps both , under different circumstances . Considering the available evidence , a case can be made for each scenario . From one perspective , EGFR - ShcD synergy could be conceptualized as an adaptive response to circumstances of EGFR upregulation or overstimulation . We have demonstrated that sequestration of the EGFR with ShcD in a perinuclear compartment decreases the receptor population at the plasma membrane , thereby reducing the sensitivity of the cell to ligand . EGFR entrapment may therefore represent a mechanism of tailoring the surface density of EGFR to suit environmental conditions , or accommodate cellular demands . This approach would have the distinct advantage of being reversible , unlike receptor degradation in the lysosome , which is a classical method of desensitizing the cell . Such a mechanism would also be expected to respond rapidly to relevant environmental fluctuations , and would thus be more immediate than regulatory measures invoking transcription or translation . Although our findings suggest that ShcD exerts a moderating effect over canonical EGFR signalling , it is not presently known whether this protects cellular integrity , promotes homeostasis , and / or prevents tumourigenesis . In some respects , it may appear counter - intuitive to allege that a protein that uncouples the EGFR from its ligand and from select proximal mitogenic effectors could have an oncogenic role in the cell . Nevertheless , ShcD has a demonstrated capacity to drive melanoma cell 134 migration and thereby contribute to metastasis ( 27 ) , and we have confirmed that ShcD can utilize the EGFR to a similar end in COS - 1 cells ( Chapter 3 ) . In the history of Shc proteins , a similar conundrum was encountered when attempting to decipher the role of p66 ShcA in prostate cancer cell proliferation . This isoform in particular is upregulated in primary prostate tumors , and is induced upon steroid hormone treatment of cultured cells ( 242 ) . The discovery that experimental p66 overexpression or knockdown could respectively increase or decrease proliferation ( 243 ) was initially hard to reconcile due to the protein’s role in oxidative apoptosis and lack of involvement in mitogenic signalling . However , it has been proposed that steroid hormones act to increase p66 expression and translocation into mitochondria , where both the redox centre of the protein and the resulting ROS it generates upon interaction with cyt c are required to promote proliferation ( 244 - 246 ) . Although ROS participation in mitogenic signalling is well documented ( 247 ) , prostate studies provided the first evidence implicating the oxidoreductase activity of p66 Shc in an oncogenic phenotype ( 245 ) . As is the case with ShcD , however , the nature of the switch that drives p66 toward a particular outcome - cell death versus proliferation - remains unclear . The scenario nevertheless serves as a unique model for the engagement of an adaptor protein in highly unconventional tumourigenic signalling . More specific clues to the potential impact of ShcD on EGFR come from the studies of receptor regulation and subversion . In the case of cytohesins , which bolster EGFR phosphorylation , overexpression is often detected in human lung adenocarcinoma , and cytohesin inhibition is associated with decreased cellular proliferation and reduced xenograft tumour growth ( 221 ) . However , while cytohesins work in concert with EGF to promote receptor activation , ShcD appears to establish a separate ligand - independent destiny for the EGFR . This important distinction suggests that cytohesin signalling likely involves the canonical EGFR paradigm , which cannot be said of ShcD . Arguably the most compelling parallels exist between the ShcD - induced phenotype and models of oncogenic EGFR transformation . Of particular interest is EGFRvIII , a common mutation in high - grade gliomas that was introduced in Section 1 . 2 . 2 . 2 . Uniquely , this N - terminally truncated variant is ligand - insensitive , resistant to downregulation , and perpetually tyrosine phosphorylated on select motifs - Y1068 , Y1148 , and Y1173 - at a level lower than that elicited by EGF stimulus ( 139 ) . Moreover , Erk is not believed to be a distal target of the 135 EGFRvIII ( 225 ) . By comparison , we have shown that a hallmark of the EGFR - ShcD phenotype is constitutive , low - level tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR on the three aforementioned sites , without engaging Erk . Although EGFRvIII remains at the cell surface while EGFR - ShcD is sequestered internally , both permutations fail to coordinate ligand , and receptor turnover appears to be muted in both circumstances . These observations are all the more relevant considering that we have found upregulated ShcD in human brain malignancies . This raises the important question of whether ShcD offers different means to the same ultimate phenotypic end that has been on the oncology radar for decades . Thus , it is a priority to investigate the transforming properties of the EGFR - ShcD partnership in its own right , irrespective of the consequences of ShcD alone in other systems . As mounting evidence contends that ligand - free EGFR signalling can have devastating consequences , it remains to be experimentally determined whether ShcD will join these ominous ranks . 136 CHAPTER 7 : REFERENCES 137 1 .
