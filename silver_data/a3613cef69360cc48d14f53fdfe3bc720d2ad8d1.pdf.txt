SH2B1 orchestrates signaling events to ﬁlopodium formation during neurite outgrowth Kuan - Wei Chen 1 , Yu - Jung Chang 1 , and Linyi Chen 1 , 2 , 3 , * 1 Institute of Molecular Medicine ; National Tsing Hua University ; Hsinchu , Taiwan , Republic of China ; 2 Brain Research Center ; National Tsing Hua University ; Hsinchu , Taiwan , Republic of China ; 3 Department of Medical Science ; National Tsing Hua University ; Hsinchu , Taiwan , Republic of China M orphogenesis during development is fundamental to the differenti - ation of several cell types . As neurite outgrowth marks neuritogenesis , for - mation of ﬁlopodia precede the forma - tion of dendrites and axons . While the structure of ﬁlopodia is well - known , the initiation of ﬁlopodia during neu - rite outgrowth is not clear . SH2B1 is known to promote neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells , hippocampal and corti - cal neurons . As a signaling adaptor protein , SH2B1 interacts with several neurotrophin receptors , and regulates signaling as well as gene expression . Our recent ﬁndings suggest that SH2B1 can be recruited to the plasma membrane and F - actin fractions by IRSp53 . IRSp53 bends plasma mem - brane and facilitates actin bundling to set the stage for ﬁlopodium formation . We further demonstrate that SH2B1 - IRSp53 complexes enhance the forma - tion of ﬁlopodia , dendrites and den - dritic branches of hippocampal and cortical neurons . While the molecular mechanism underlying ﬁlopodium ini - tiation is not clear , we propose that SH2B1 - neurotrophin interacting sites may mark the putative sites of ﬁlopo - dium initiation . Morphogenesis during development involve dynamic and dramatic changes of cell morphology , which is largely reg - ulated by actin cytoskeleton . 1 An array of proteins have been implicated in reg - ulating polymerization of actins into ﬁl - aments , and thus facilitating the organization of ﬁlaments into deﬁned structures , such as lamellipodia , stress ﬁbers and ﬁlopodia . 1 - 5 Filopodia are actin - rich ﬁnger - like membrane protru - sions and function by sensing environ - mental cues , serving as sites for integrating signaling and interacting with extracellular matrix . In the devel - oping mammalian brain , neurotrophic factors initiate intracellular signaling to regulate gene expression for controlling neural cell fate . These factors including NGF ( nerve growth factor ) , BDNF ( brain - derived neurotrophic factor ) and FGFs ( ﬁbroblast growth factors ) are reported to promote differentiation and survival of neurons . While neurite outgrowth is the marker for morphological differentia - tion , ﬁlopodium formation precedes the formation of neurites . 6 , 7 Embryonic hippocampal neurons initiate motile actin - rich ﬁlopodia , followed by the microtubule - supported extension of neurites , and then determination of dendrites and axons . Although it is not clear whether the formation of dendrites and axons uses the same mechanism , the initiation and formation of ﬁlopodia are obviously important steps during morphogenesis of neurons . Nonetheless , the molecular mechanisms underlying the initial membrane protrusion during ﬁlopodium formation is not completely understood . The adaptor / scaffolding protein SH2B1 is known to enhance neurite outgrowth . 8 - 12 SH2B1 contains several protein - protein interaction domains that have been implicated in regulating actin , cell motility , differentiation and gene expression ( Fig . 1 ) . Our recent studies aim to dissect whether SH2B1 participates in the initiation , extension , Keywords : actin remodeling , ﬁlopodia , neurite outgrowth , neuronal differentia - tion , neurotrophin signaling © Kuan - Wei Chen , Yu - Jung Chang , and Linyi Chen * Correspondence to : Linyi Chen ; Email : lchen @ life . nthu . edu . tw Submitted : 04 / 08 / 2015 Accepted : 04 / 20 / 2015 http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1080 / 19420889 . 2015 . 1044189 This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution - Non - Commercial License ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by - nc / 3 . 0 / ) , which permits unrestricted non - commercial use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided the original work is prop - erly cited .

An early work suggests that SH2B1 promotes initia - tion of neurites . 12 We further demon - strate that SH2B1 is recruited to the plasma membrane and F - actin fractions by IRSp53 to promote the formation of ﬁlopodia . 13 IRSp53 , the Insulin Recep - tor Substrate of 53 kDa , family has emerged as a dominant regulatory pro - tein for ﬁlopodium formation . 14 - 16 SH3 domain of IRSp53 is known to interact with several actin modiﬁers ( Fig . 2 ) . A central question is how IRSp53 regu - lates cytoskeleton assembly during neu - ritogenesis . Our ﬁndings suggest that SH2B1 - IRSp53 complexes promote the formation of dendrites and dendritic branches of hippocampal neurons . 17 Although both SH2B1 and IRSp53 can bind to actin , the actin - binding domain of SH2B1 appears to be not required . Given that SH2B1 and IRSp53 each has several binding partners , it remains to be determined whether their binding partners exist in the SH2B1 - IRSp53 complexes and whether they actively participate in the process of neuritogen - esis . Moreover , the molecular mecha - nisms for controlling the initiation of dendritic ﬁlopodia are not clear . Den - dritic ﬁlopodia mainly initiate from the dendritic shaft or small lamellipodia . The actin - rich sites seem to be the base of protruding ﬁlopodia . Models for ran - dom or signal - induced initiation have been proposed without concrete evidence . Both SH2B1 and IRSp53 are phosphorylated adaptors . 18 - 20 SH2B1 , speciﬁcally , is known to undergo neuro - trophin - induced phosphorylation at tyrosines , serines and threonines . It is thus very likely that SH2B1 and possi - bly IRSp53 are phosphorylated in response to external cue of neurotro - phins . Subsequently , SH2B1 regulates neurotrophin - induced signaling and gene expression , 8 , 21 concomitantly being recruited to IRSp53 - containing com - plexes to remodel actin cytoskeleton , and modulate morphogenesis ( Fig . 3 ) . It is thus reasonable to speculate that SH2B1 - neurotrophin receptor interac - tion sites are at the proximity of SH2B1 - IRSp53 complexes which may Figure 1 .
