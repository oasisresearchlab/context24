Unbranched F - actin is de 20 novo generated by formin and without formin cleavage furrow ingression fails . In C . elegans 21 depletion of septin restores cleavage furrow ingression in formin ( CYK - 1 ) mutants . How the 22 cleavage furrow ingresses without a detectable unbranched F - actin ring is not known . We 23 report , that in this setting anillin ( ANI - 1 ) is essential for furrow ingression and forms a meshwork 24 of linear structures , which circumferentially align around the cell equator . Although equatorial 25 ANI - 1 recruitment is facilitated by septins , the formation of linear ANI - 1 structures is septin 26 independent . Analysis of ANI - 1 deletion mutants reveals that its disordered linker region is 27 required for linear structure formation and furrow ingression . We also found that myosin II 28 ( NMY - 2 ) decorates linear ANI - 1 structures and promotes their circumferential alignment . NMY - 29 2 also interacts with various lipids and forms membrane localized clusters in absence of F - 30 actin and anillin binding . This suggests that NMY - 2 represents an independent link between 31 the F - actin / ANI - 1 network and the plasma membrane . Collectively , our data reveals a 32 compensatory mechanism , mediated by ANI - 1 linear structures and membrane - bound NMY - 33 2 , that promotes furrow formation and ingression when formins are depleted and therefore 34 unbranched F - actin polymerization is compromised . 35 3 Introduction 36 During cytokinesis a contractile ring consisting of unbranched filamentous actin ( F - actin ) and 37 myosin II assembles underneath the plasma membrane between the segregating 38 chromosomes . Constriction of the actin - myosin ring splits the mother cell into two daughter 39 cells ( D’Avino et al . , 2015 ; Mishima , 2016 ; Pollard and O’Shaughnessy , 2019 ) . Stimulatory 40 and inhibitory signals emanating from the mitotic spindle activate RhoA at the cell equator , 41 which in turn induces contractile ring assembly ( Basant and Glotzer , 2018 ; Dechant and 42 Glotzer , 2003 ; Gomez - Cavazos et al . , 2020 ; Mangal et al . , 2018 ; Prokopenko et al . , 1999 ; 43 Schneid et al . , 2021 ; Yüce et al . , 2005 ; Zanin et al . , 2013 ) . Active RhoA releases the 44 autoinhibitory conformation of formin with the help of the contractile ring component anillin and 45 IQGAP1 ( Chen et al . , 2020 ; Chen et al . , 2017 ; Li and Higgs , 2003 ; Otomo et al . , 2005 ) . Active 46 formin binds to the barbed end of actin filaments and induces the polymerization of long 47 unbranched F - actin ( Kühn and Geyer , 2014 ) . F - actin circumferentially aligns around the cell 48 equator which is thought to facilitate furrow ingression ( Henson et al . , 2017 ; Leite et al . , 2020 ; 49 Reymann et al . , 2016 ; Schroeder , 1968 ; Spira et al . , 2017 ) . Without formin cleavage furrow 50 formation and cytokinesis fail ( Pelham and Chang , 2002 ; Severson et al . , 2002 ; Swan et al . , 51 1998 ; Watanabe et al . , 2008 ) . 52 In addition to formin , RhoA also recruits and activates non - muscle myosin II ( NMY - 2 in C . 53 elegans ) via RhoA kinase . The motor myosin II interacts with unbranched F - actin and is 54 required for cytokinesis in many systems ( Cuenca et al . , 2003 ; De Lozanne and Spudich , 1987 ; 55 Straight et al . , 2003 ) . Myosin II consists of a globular motor domain and coiled - coil domain 56 through which it forms bipolar minifilaments . To be active , myosin II has to bind the 57 phosphorylated regulatory light chain ( RLC ) and essential light chain ( ELC ) ( Pollard , 2020 ) . In 58 addition to RhoA - dependent myosin II recruitment , a positive feedback mechanism between 59 myosin II generated equatorial compression and equatorial directed flow enhances myosin II 60 accumulation at the cell equator further ( Khaliullin et al . , 2018 ) . Myosin II becomes enriched at 61 the cell equator independently of its binding partner F - actin or anillin ( Hickson and O’Farrell , 62 2008 ; Maddox et al . , 2005 ) . Myosin II inhibition does not prevent the recruitment of other ring 63 components to the equator but blocks ring constriction ( Davies et al . , 2014 ; Straight et al . , 64 2003 ; Tse et al . , 2011 ) . In fission yeast myosin II is targeted to the membrane by the anillin 65 homologue Mid1p and together with formin and numerous other proteins they form defined 66 protein assemblies called nodes . Within each node myosin II heads point away from the 67 membrane and grab and pull on actin filaments generated and anchored at adjacent nodes . 68 This leads to the coalescence of nodes and eventually ring constriction ( Pollard and 69 O’Shaughnessy , 2019 ) . 70 Another component of the contractile ring is the conserved multidomain protein anillin ( ANI - 1 71 in C . elegans ) ( D’Avino et al . , 2015 ; Mishima , 2016 ; Naydenov et al . , 2020 ; Piekny and 72 4 Maddox , 2010 ) . Due to its binding to the membrane or membrane - associated proteins , F - actin 73 and myosin II , anillin represents an important linker between the actin - myosin ring and the 74 membrane . Anillin is also considered a scaffolding component of the contractile ring since 75 numerous interaction partners have been documented . With its C - terminus anillin interacts 76 with microtubules ( van Oostende Triplet et al . , 2014 ) , with lipids through the C2 domain , with 77 membrane - associated active RhoA via the RhoA binding domain ( RBD ) ( Piekny and Glotzer , 78 2008 ; Sun et al . , 2015 ) , and with septins via the PH domain ( El Amine et al . , 2013 ; Field et al . , 79 2005 ; Liu et al . , 2012 ; Oegema et al . , 2000 ) . With its N - terminus anillin binds to myosin II 80 ( Straight et al . , 2005 ) , F - actin ( Field and Alberts , 1995 ; Jananji et al . , 2017 ; Matsuda et al . , 81 2019 ; Oegema et al . , 2000 ; Tian et al . , 2015 ) , formins ( Chen et al . , 2017 ; Watanabe et al . , 82 2008 ) and importin ( Beaudet et al . , 2020 ) . Anillin localization to the cell equator requires RhoA 83 activation but not myosin II , F - actin , septins or formins ( D’Avino et al . , 2008 ; Hickson and 84 O’Farrell , 2008 ; Maddox et al . , 2005 ; Straight et al . , 2005 ; Watanabe et al . , 2008 ) . Consistent 85 with its role as a membrane - actomyosin linker , anillin depletion results in unstable furrows and 86 in cytokinesis failure in fly and human cells ( Piekny and Glotzer , 2008 ; Straight et al . , 2005 ) . 87 C . elegans has three anillin homologues ( ANI - 1 , ANI - 2 , and ANI - 3 ) of which only ANI - 1 is 88 expressed in the early embryo and required for embryonic development . ANI - 1 depletion in 89 zygotes does not cause cytokinesis failure but results in symmetric furrow ingression ( Maddox 90 et al . , 2005 ; Maddox et al . , 2007 ) . Anillin positively feeds back on RhoA activity ( Piekny and 91 Glotzer , 2008 ) by stabilizing active RhoA at the membrane and thereby facilitating RhoA 92 effector binding ( Budnar et al . , 2019 ) . Anillin also binds and recruits septins to the contractile 93 ring ( Field et al . , 2005 ; Hickson and O’Farrell , 2008 ; Liu et al . , 2012 ; Maddox et al . , 2005 ) . 94 Recent in vitro work suggests that anillin could contribute to force generation during 95 constriction by passive diffusion along cross linked F - actin filaments ( Kučera et al . , 2021 ) . 96 Besides F - actin and myosin II , septins are the third filament forming protein of the contractile 97 ring and septins bind the plasma membrane ( Mostowy and Cossart , 2012 ) . Similar to anillin , 98 septins are required for ring ingression in human cells ( Estey et al . , 2010 ) but are not essential 99 in C . elegans zygotes . Whereas humans have 13 septins , C . elegans has two ( UNC - 59 and 100 UNC - 61 ) , which are only essential for some postembryonic divisions ( Nguyen et al . , 2000 ) . 101 Together , septin and anillin also function during the late stages of cytokinesis during 102 intercellular bridge formation ( Estey et al . , 2010 ; Green et al . , 2013 ; Kechad et al . , 2012 ; 103 Renshaw et al . , 2014 ) . 104 During the initial assembly phase ring components such as F - actin , myosin II and anillin 105 localize in a broad equatorial band , which subsequently compacts and matures into the 106 contractile ring ( Lewellyn et al . , 2010 ) . Recent super - resolution microscopy in sea urchin 107 embryos revealed that myosin II , anillin and septin initially co - localize in puncta reminiscent to 108 the nodes in yeast ( Chelsea Garno , 2021 ) . Subsequently , a dense meshwork forms in which 109 5 myosin II filaments orient parallel to actin filaments ( Beach et al . , 2014 ; Fenix et al . , 2016 ; 110 Henson et al . , 2017 ) . This organization is consistent with myosin II mediating ring constriction 111 by actin filament sliding in a purse - string - like fashion . Consistently myosin II motor activity is 112 required for ring constriction ( Osório et al . , 2019 ) . 113 Although actin - based contractility appears to be the predominant mechanisms for furrow 114 ingression , alternative mechanisms were also reported sporadically . For example , the 115 migration of the two daughter cells away from each other supports furrow ingression in the 116 absence of a visible F - actin ring in non - transformed human RPE1 cells and in Dictyostelium 117 ( Dix et al . , 2018 ; Nagasaki et al . , 2009 ; Neujahr et al . , 1997 ) and in Chlamodymonas furrow 118 ingression does not require F - actin ( Onishi et al . , 2020 ) . In C . elegans depletion of septin in 119 the formin ( CYK - 1 ) temperature sensitive ( ts ) mutant restored furrow ingression although no 120 F - actin ring was detectable ( Jordan et al . , 2016 ) . Here we investigate the mechanism of furrow 121 ingression after co - depletion of CYK - 1 and septins in the C . elegans one - cell embryo . We 122 discover that ANI - 1 forms a meshwork of linear structures that circumferentially align around 123 the cell equator and promote furrow ingression without detectable unbranched F - actin and 124 septins . Mutational analysis reveals that the disordered N - terminal half of ANI - 1 is sufficient 125 for linear structure formation and furrow ingression . Thereby our work uncovers a novel ANI - 126 1 - dependent mechanism of cleavage furrow ingression . 127 6 Results 128 ANI - 1 is required for furrow ingression after CYK - 1 and septin co - depletion 129 C . elegans has six formins and CYK - 1 , a Diaphanous - type formin , is the only one known to be 130 essential for cytokinesis ( Pruyne , 2016 ; Severson et al . , 2002 ; Swan et al . , 1998 ) . Surprisingly , 131 it was found that cyk - 1ts mutant embryos , which lack unbranched F - actin , still ingress a 132 cleavage furrow when septins are depleted ( Fig . 1A ) ( Davies et al . , 2018 ; Jordan et al . , 2016 ) . 133 We confirmed this observation as CYK - 1 depletion by RNAi prevented cleavage furrow 134 formation but septin UNC - 61 co - depletion facilitated cleavage furrow ingression in all embryos 135 ( Fig . 1B , C , Movie 1 ) . In 5 / 10 cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) ; septin unc - 61 ( RNAi ) embryos the furrow remained 136 closed until the onset of the second cell division . In the remaining embryos , the furrow 137 eventually regressed around 800 sec after NEBD ( Fig . 1B ) . C . elegans has two septins ( UNC - 138 61 and UNC - 59 ) and they depend on each other for membrane localization ( Nguyen et al . , 139 2000 ) , therefore depletion of one is sufficient to disrupt the function of the complex . 140 Consistently , we observed that endogenously GFP - tagged septin UNC - 59 did not localize to the 141 equatorial cortex after septin unc - 61 ( RNAi ) or cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) ; septin unc - 61 ( RNAi ) ( Fig . S1A , B ) . 142 Similarly , endogenously tagged CYK - 1 or F - actin , visualized by LifeAct : : RFP , no longer 143 accumulated at the cell equator after single or double cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) treatments , confirming 144 previous observations ( Chan et al . , 2018 ; Davies et al . , 2018 ; Ding et al . , 2017 ; Jordan et al . , 145 2016 ) ( Fig . S1C , D ) . Immunoblot analysis of adult worms revealed that septin unc - 59 ( RNAi ) and 146 cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) strongly reduced endogenously - tagged septin UNC - 59 and CYK - 1 protein levels , 147 respectively ( Fig . S1E ) . In addition to formin nucleated F - actin , the cortex contains Arp2 / 3 148 nucleated branched F - actin , which is not essential for cytokinesis ( Chan et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , 149 we tested whether the remaining Arp2 / 3 - generated F - actin contributes to furrowing in CYK - 1 150 and septin co - depleted embryos by additional depletion of the Arp2 homologue ARX - 2 . All cyk - 151 1 ( RNAi ) ; septin unc - 61 ( RNAi ) ; arx - 2 ( RNAi ) embryos fully ingressed a cleavage furrow ( Fig . S2A , 152 B ) , suggesting that Arp2 / 3 - generated F - actin is also not essential for furrowing in this condition . 153 To address the mechanism how CYK - 1 and septin co - depleted embryos ingress a cleavage 154 furrow , we determined whether ANI - 1 is required for furrow ingression in this background . 155 Whereas ANI - 1 depletion alone does not cause cytokinesis failure in the one - cell embryo 156 ( Maddox et al . , 2005 ) , ANI - 1 depletion together with CYK - 1 and septin UNC - 61 prevented 157 cleavage furrow ingression ( Fig . 1B , C ) . Immunoblot analysis of ANI - 1 protein levels showed 158 that ANI - 1 levels were strongly reduced ( Fig . S2C ) . Further , quantification of ANI - 1 159 fluorescence intensity on the cortex in ani - 1 single , double and triple RNAi depletions 160 confirmed that ANI - 1 depletion was highly efficient in the one - cell embryo ( Fig . S2D , E ) . 161 Together , ANI - 1 promotes furrow ingression in case CYK - 1 and septin levels are low . 162 163 7 ANI - 1 localizes to septin - independent linear structures , especially after the depletion 164 of the formin CYK - 1 165 Since ANI - 1 was required for furrow ingression , we analyzed ANI - 1 localization by imaging 166 endogenously NeonGreen - tagged ANI - 1 on the cell cortex . In control anaphase embryos ANI - 167 1 was enriched in cortical patches as previously published ( Lewellyn et al . , 2010 ) , but also 168 localized in linear structures , which sometimes radiate out of cortical patches ( Fig . 2A , Movie 169 2 ) . Comparison of the localization of ANI - 1 with endogenously - tagged myosin II ( NMY - 170 2 : : mKate ) revealed that NMY - 2 was also present in the cortical patches ( Werner et al . , 2007 ) 171 and occasionally decorated the linear ANI - 1 structures . In CYK - 1 - depleted embryos cortical 172 ANI - 1 patches were absent and numerous linear structures , decorated with NMY - 2 , formed 173 during early anaphase ( Fig . 2A , Movie 2 ) . To quantify the number of the linear ANI - 1 structures , 174 we measured the length and width of all structures in a defined region at the cell equator . 175 Structures with a length / width ratio < 4 were assigned to the non - linear and ≥4 to the linear 176 class ( Fig . S3A ) . Linear ANI - 1 structures were occasionally observed in control embryos and 177 after cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) their number increased ( Fig . 2B ) . In cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) linear ANI - 1 structures had 178 a length of ~ 2 - 9 µm and width of ~ 0 . 5 µm . To determine whether the overall ANI - 1 distribution 179 was altered after cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) , ANI - 1 fluorescence intensity was measured along the cell cortex 180 180 s after NEBD , which represent the time point of contractile ring assembly . After cyk - 181 1 ( RNAi ) , ANI - 1 was still enriched in an equatorial zone , although its intensity was slightly 182 reduced in comparison to control embryos ( Fig . S3B ) . After the co - depletion of septin UNC - 61 and 183 CYK - 1 , linear ANI - 1 structures were still present , although cortical ANI - 1 levels decreased 184 further ( Fig . 2A , B , S3B ) , consistent with the fact that septin and anillin interact in other 185 organisms ( Straight et al . , 2005 ) . Measurement of the orientation of ANI - 1 at the cell equator 186 during anaphase revealed that ANI - 1 circumferentially aligns around the cell equator similar to 187 F - actin in control embryos ( Fig . 2C ) . Reduction of unbranched F - actin alone or together with 188 septin UNC - 61 did not prevent alignment of ANI - 1 ( Fig . 2C ) . Since ANI - 1 appeared to form those 189 linear structures , we determined whether septin also localized to linear structures after cyk - 190 1 ( RNAi ) . Indeed , we observed that after cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) endogenously - tagged septin UNC - 59 was 191 also present in linear structures similar to ANI - 1 and septin UNC - 59 cortical intensity levels were 192 increased ( Fig . S3C - E ) . 193 Since reduction of CYK - 1 - nucleated unbranched F - actin altered ANI - 1 localization , we 194 analyzed whether also Arp2 / 3 - nucleated branched F - actin has an influence on ANI - 1 by 195 depleting ARX - 2 . Consistent with previous reports we observed a reduction of F - actin foci after 196 arx - 2 ( RNAi ) ( Fig . S4A ) and a delay in furrow formation and ANI - 1 accumulation ( Fig . S4B , C ) 197 ( Chan et al . , 2018 ; Davies et al . , 2014 ; Shivas and Skop , 2012 ) . However , ARX - 2 depletion 198 did not impact ANI - 1 localization to linear structures in control or cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) embryos ( Fig . 199 S4B , D , Movie 3 ) . 200 8 In summary , CYK - 1 - nucleated unbranched , but not Arp2 / 3 - nucleated branched F - actin limits 201 the formation of linear ANI - 1 structures . 202 203 NMY - 2 is required for the orientation of the linear ANI - 1 structures and furrow 204 ingression in embryos depleted of CYK - 1 and septin 205 We found that ANI - 1 forms linear structures decorated by NMY - 2 and supports furrow 206 ingression in cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) ; septin unc - 61 ( RNAi ) embryos . To test whether NMY - 2 is required for 207 the formation or alignment of the linear ANI - 1 structure , we depleted NMY - 2 together with CYK - 208 1 or CYK - 1 and septin UNC - 61 . Immunoblot analysis and quantification of cortical NMY - 2 209 fluorescence intensity confirmed that nmy - 2 ( RNAi ) strongly reduced endogenously - tagged 210 NMY - 2 protein levels in worm lysates and on the cell cortex during anaphase in all tested RNAi 211 conditions ( Fig . S5A - C ) . Depletion of NMY - 2 alone or in combination with CYK - 1 or CYK - 1 and 212 septin UNC - 61 did not prevent linear ANI - 1 structure formation , although they were no longer 213 circumferentially aligned around the cell equator ( Fig . 3A - C , Movie 4 ) . This suggests that NMY - 214 2 aligns linear ANI - 1 structures , perhaps by directly binding to the ANI - 1 N - terminus . In normal 215 cytokinesis myosin II binds and aligns F - actin and mediates furrow ingression ( Osório et al . , 216 2019 ) , so we asked whether NMY - 2 still mediates furrow ingression in cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) ; septin unc - 217 61 ( RNAi ) embryos . NMY - 2 co - depletion abolished furrow ingression in cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) ; septin unc - 218 61 ( RNAi ) embryos ( Fig . 3D , S5E ) , although ANI - 1 was still enriched at the cell equator ( Fig . 219 3A , S5D ) . In conclusion , NMY - 2 is absolutely required to mediate furrow ingression after the 220 reduction of CYK - 1 and septins . Further , NMY - 2 is involved in aligning the linear ANI - 1 221 structures circumferentially but is not essential for their formation . 222 223 ANI - 1 and NMY - 2 form membrane - localized structures in the absence of F - actin , 224 independently of the ANI - 1 N - terminus 225 After depolymerization of F - actin by Latrunculin A treatment in Drosophila cells , anillin and the 226 RLC of myosin II enrich in circular foci that evolve into linear structures and these structures 227 also form independently of each other ( D’Avino et al . , 2008 ; Hickson and O’Farrell , 2008 ; 228 Oegema et al . , 2000 ) . In the C . elegans zygote , NMY - 2 also forms circular foci after Latrunculin 229 A addition ( Michaux et al . , 2018 ; Sobral et al . , 2021 ) . However , whether ANI - 1 is also present 230 in those circular NMY - 2 foci and whether linear structures still form after F - actin 231 depolymerization has not been investigated in C . elegans . To study this , we treated embryos 232 with Latrunculin A , which caused the disappearance of F - actin from the cortex within ~ 80 sec 233 ( Fig . S6A - C ) and the appearance of highly dynamic NMY - 2 and ANI - 1 structures that formed 234 and disappeared quickly ( Fig . S6D , E , Movie 5 ) . After loss of cortical F - actin , NMY - 2 and ANI - 235 1 co - localized in numerous non - linear structures 180 s after NEBD that became linear at later 236 anaphase time points ( Fig . 4A , B ) . Measurement of fluorescence intensities at the cell cortex 237 9 revealed that upon F - actin depolymerization NMY - 2 and ANI - 1 accumulated in an equatorial 238 zone similar to control embryos , although NMY - 2 fluorescence was increased at 255 s ( Fig . 239 S6F ) . 240 Vertebrate anillin binds myosin II with its N - terminus ( Straight et al . , 2005 ) and the co - 241 localization of anillin and myosin II in foci after Latrunculin A treatment requires the anillin N - 242 terminus in Drosophila cells ( Carim et al . , 2020 ) . Since NMY - 2 and ANI - 1 structures co - localize 243 after Latrunculin A treatment and NMY - 2 is expected to interact with the ANI - 1 N - terminus , we 244 analyzed whether ANI - 1 and NMY - 2 still form structures that co - localize when the N - terminus 245 of ANI - 1 is absent . We used an ANI - 1 fragment that comprises the RBD , C2 and PH domain 246 ( ∆1 - 680 , ANI - 1 AH - PH ( Tse et al . , 2012 ) ) and depleted endogenous ANI - 1 by RNAi to prevent 247 NMY - 2 binding via full - length endogenous ANI - 1 . After Latrunculin A addition NMY - 2 and ANI - 248 1 AH - PH both formed circular structures , but these did not co - localize and did not become linear 249 over time ( Fig . 4B , C , Movie 6 ) . This shows that the N - terminus of ANI - 1 is not required for the 250 formation of non - linear membrane structures but is essential for the co - localization with NMY - 251 2 structures . Thus , like in other organisms the N - terminus of ANI - 1 possibly interacts with NMY - 252 2 . 253 Since NMY - 2 formed membrane - localized structures independently of its binding partners F - 254 actin and of the ANI - 1 N - terminus , we hypothesized that NMY - 2 could bind the membrane 255 directly after its activation by RhoA signaling . To test this , we purified NMY - 2 in a complex with 256 the myosin essential light chain 4 ( MLC - 4 ) and the myosin regulatory light chain ( MLC - 5 ) . We 257 found that the NMY - 2 / MLC - 4 / MLC - 5 complex , but not MLC - 4 alone , bound to several lipids 258 known to be enriched in the plasma membrane ( Fig . 4D , E ) . This suggests that the NMY - 259 2 / MLC - 4 / MLC - 5 complex directly binds the plasma membrane . 260 In summary , in the absence of F - actin , ANI - 1 and NMY - 2 co - localize to non - linear and linear 261 structures , although the formation of linear structures takes much longer than in cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) . 262 The co - localization but not the formation of the ANI - 1 and NMY - 2 non - linear structures requires 263 the ANI - 1 N - terminus , suggesting that the binding of NMY - 2 to the ANI - 1 N - terminus pulls 264 those structures together . Since the NMY - 2 / MLC - 4 / MLC - 5 complex bound to several 265 membrane lipids , we conclude that this complex represents an independent membrane 266 anchor . 267 268 The linker region between the N - and C - terminus of ANI - 1 is essential for linear 269 structure formation 270 ANI - 1 contains multiple distinct domains : an actin - binding domain ( ABD ) ( Tian et al . , 2015 ) 271 and a predicted myosin II binding domain ( MBD ) ( Maddox et al . , 2005 ) at the N - terminus , and 272 a RBD , a C2 membrane binding and a PH domain at the C - terminus ( Sun et al . , 2015 ) ( Fig . 273 S7A ) . Sequence analysis predicts that the ANI - 1 N - terminus contains numerous intrinsically 274 10 disordered regions ( IDRs ) similar to human anillin ( Fig . S7A , B ) and yeast Mid1p ( Chatterjee 275 and Pollard , 2019 ) . 276 To analyze whether the N - or C - terminal halves of ANI - 1 form linear structures , we generated 277 animals expressing transgenic ANI - 1 C - term ( ANI - 1 ∆48 - 680 ) , which comprises the RBD , the C2 278 and the PH domain , or ANI - 1 N - term ( ANI - 1 ∆765 - 1159 ) , which comprises the putative MBD , the 279 ABD and the linker region . Since the N - terminal half lacks a membrane binding motif we fused 280 it with the membrane binding regions of RHO - 1 ( RhoA in C . elegans , Fig . S8A ) . To test the 281 function and localization of the ANI - 1 variants in the absence of endogenous ANI - 1 , we 282 rendered the transgenes ani - 1 RNAi resistant so that we could specifically deplete endogenous 283 ANI - 1 by RNAi ( Fig . S8B ) . 284 As a control we generated a full - length wild - type ANI - 1 transgene ( ANI - 1 WT ) , which rescued 285 embryonic lethality after ani - 1 ( RNAi ) suggesting that it is functional ( Fig . S8C ) . ANI - 1 WT was 286 enriched at the cell equator and after depletion of CYK - 1 and co - depletion of CYK - 1 and 287 septin UNC - 61 , the number of linear ANI - 1 WT structures was increased and they circumferentially 288 aligned around the cell equator ( Fig . 5A - F , Movie 7 - 9 ) . Together , the GFP - tagged ANI - 1 WT 289 transgene behaves similar to endogenously tagged NG : : ANI - 1 . 290 ANI - 1 N - term or ANI - 1 C - term were found to express at similar levels as ANI - 1 WT and both mutants 291 partially rescued embryonic lethality in the absence of endogenous ANI - 1 ( Fig . S8C , D ) . The 292 ANI - 1 C - term fragment was enriched at the cell equator , but its cortical levels were reduced in 293 comparison to those of ANI - 1 WT ( Fig . 5A , B ) . ANI - 1 C - term formed very few linear but numerous 294 non - linear structures ( Fig . 5A , C , Movie 7 ) . After CYK - 1 depletion , ANI - 1 C - term did not form any 295 linear structures but only non - linear ones that did not show circumferential alignment ( Fig . 5C , 296 D , F , Movie 8 ) . Co - depletion of CYK - 1 and septin UNC - 61 resulted in a strong reduction of cortical 297 ANI - 1 C - term levels in comparison to ANI - 1 WT ( Fig . 5B , E , Movie 9 ) and the absence of non - linear 298 foci , suggesting that its enrichment in non - linear structures requires septin binding . However , 299 transient pulsatile accumulation of ANI - 1 C - term was still observed , possibly due to active RhoA 300 binding ( Movie 9 ) . Since almost no ANI - 1 C - term localized to the cell equator after cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) ; 301 septin unc - 61 ( RNAi ) , we did not perform the structure or directionality analysis . The ANI - 1 N - term 302 fragment was enriched at the anterior cortex ( Fig . 5A , B , Movie 12 ) , probably because RhoA 303 and septin binding domains were missing . Therefore , we performed the structure analysis of 304 the ANI - 1 N - term fragment in a region of the anterior cortex and found that it formed linear 305 structures in all RNAi conditions ( Fig . 5A , C , D , E , Movie 7 - 9 ) . Together this demonstrates that 306 the N - terminal but not the C - terminal half of ANI - 1 is sufficient to form linear structures after 307 cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) . 308 Since the N - terminus was sufficient for linear structure formation , we tested whether the 309 predicted MBD and ABD domains are required for their formation . We generated ANI - 1 310 transgenes where the MBD ( ∆48 - 160 , Fig . S8A ) or the ABD ( ∆236 - 460 ) or both ( ∆48 - 460 ) 311 11 domains had been deleted . All transgenes were expressed at similar levels to ANI - 1 WT and 312 rescued embryonic lethality after ani - 1 ( RNAi ) ( Fig . S8C , D ) . The cortical fluorescence 313 intensities , the number of linear structures and the circumferential alignment of the ∆48 - 160 , 314 ∆236 - 460 and ∆48 - 460 ANI - 1 mutants were comparable to that of ANI - 1 WT after ani - 1 ( RNAi ) 315 or cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) ani - 1 ( RNAi ) ( Fig . 5B , S9A - E , Movie 10 and 11 ) . After co - depletion of CYK - 1 316 and septin UNC - 61 , the cortical levels of ANI - 1 ∆48 - 460 were strongly reduced at the cell equator , 317 but the levels of ANI - 1 ∆48 - 160 and ANI - 1 ∆236 - 460 were comparable to ANI - 1 WT . In those 318 embryos ANI - 1 ∆48 - 160 and ANI - 1 ∆236 - 460 still formed linear structures that aligned 319 circumferentially around the cell equator ( Fig . 5B , S9C - E , Movie 12 ) . Together , our ANI - 1 320 mutant analysis reveals that neither the putative MDB nor the ABD , but rather the linker region 321 is essential for linear structure formation and their circumferential alignment after CYK - 1 322 depletion . 323 324 The ANI - 1 N - term partially recues furrow ingression in cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) ; septin unc - 61 ( RNAi ) 325 embryos 326 To investigate whether the different ANI - 1 mutants support furrow ingression , we filmed 327 embryos in the central plane after co - depletion of CYK - 1 or CYK - 1 and septin UNC - 61 . As 328 expected , depletion of CYK - 1 in ANI - 1 WT expressing embryos prevented furrow ingression and 329 co - depletion of CYK - 1 and septin UNC - 61 resulted in complete furrow ingression ( Fig . 6 ) . ANI - 1 330 ∆48 - 160 and ANI - 1 ∆236 - 460 rescued cleavage furrow ingression similar to ANI - 1 WT ( Fig . 6 ) 331 consistent with the fact that they formed linear structures . ANI - 1 ∆48 - 460 and ANI - 1 C - term did 332 not rescue furrow ingression , but as both localized only weakly to the cortex no rescue was 333 expected ( Fig . S10 ) . Importantly , five out of eight embryos expressing ANI - 1 N - term fully 334 ingressed a cleavage furrow and in two of those embryos the cleavage furrow remained closed 335 until the end of the movie . This demonstrated that the N - terminus of ANI - 1 , even though not 336 able to fully enrich at the cell equator , is able to partially rescue the cytokinesis failure in cyk - 337 1 ( RNAi ) ani - 1 ( RNAi ) ; septin unc - 61 ( RNAi ) embryos . 338 12 Discussion 339 In animal cells the contractile ring consists of formin - nucleated unbranched F - actin , which 340 circumferentially aligns around the cell equator . Myosin - dependent constriction of the 341 contractile ring mediates cleavage furrow ingression ( Leite et al . , 2019 ) . Here we discover an 342 ANI - 1 - dependent mechanism that promotes furrow ingression when the levels of formin - 343 nucleated unbranched F - actin and septins are reduced ( Fig . S11 ) . In this situation ANI - 1 forms 344 a meshwork of linear structures decorated by NMY - 2 that circumferentially align around the 345 cell equator . Based on previous reports and our data we propose the following model for furrow 346 ingression after the depletion of septins and formins : active RHO - 1 recruits ANI - 1 and NMY - 2 347 to the cell equator in anaphase . ANI - 1 is tethered to the equatorial membrane by its C2 and 348 RBD domain . The disordered ANI - 1 N - terminus extends into the cytoplasm , interacts with 349 neighboring ANI - 1 molecules and forms the linear structures . Membrane - bound NMY - 2 350 minifilaments crosslink and circumferentially align linear ANI - 1 structures around the cell 351 equator . Adjacent linear ANI - 1 structures interact and shorten in length . This shortening of 352 linear ANI - 1 structures is propagated around the ANI - 1 network by the crosslinker NMY - 2 . 353 Since both ANI - 1 and NMY - 2 are linked to the membrane the contraction force is conveyed to 354 the membrane and the furrow forms and ingresses . Some linear ANI - 1 structures are present 355 in wild type embryos and could also assist with furrow ingression by a similar mechanism in 356 the presence of normal levels of formin - nucleated F - actin . 357 358 NMY - 2 is an independent membrane anchor , which links the actin cortex with the 359 plasma membrane 360 NMY - 2 enriches in foci on the equatorial plasma membrane after F - actin depolymerization 361 even in the absence of the ANI - 1 N - terminus . Furthermore , our in vitro binding assays show , 362 that NMY - 2 , together with the RLC and ELC , interacts with multiple plasma membrane lipids . 363 Together , our in vivo and in vitro data suggest that NMY - 2 , after activation by RhoA signaling , 364 binds the membrane directly . Membrane binding of myosin II , seems conserved in other 365 organisms as in Drosophila cells myosin also localizes independently of anillin and F - actin to 366 the membrane ( Carim et al . , 2020 ) . In fission yeast Mid1p targets Myo2 to the cytokinesis 367 nodes ( Motegi et al . , 2004 ; Saha and Pollard , 2012 ) , and Mid1p but not Myo2 leaves the nodes 368 during ring constriction suggesting that Myo2 could also bind the plasma membrane . A 369 previous study found that myosin II interacts with lipids through its RLC binding site and lipid 370 binding resulted in displacement of the RLC ( Liu et al . , 2016 ) . This implied that membrane - 371 bound myosin II is in the inactive state , since the RLC is required for myosin II activity . In 372 contrast , we observed that NMY - 2 interacts with membrane lipids in the presence of the RLC 373 and ELC suggesting that NMY - 2 can bind the membrane in its active state . Together , in C . 374 elegans , membrane - bound active NMY - 2 might represent an independent membrane anchor , 375 13 which links the plasma membrane with the actin cortex and thereby could transmit forces 376 generated in the contractile ring to the plasma membrane . NMY - 2 membrane tethering might 377 function redundantly with other membrane binding components such as ECT2 ( Su et al . , 378 2011 ) , anillin ( Liu et al . , 2012 ) , and RacGAP1 ( Lekomtsev et al . , 2012 ) . Determining the region 379 of the NMY - 2 / MLC - 4 / MLC - 5 complex that interacts with the plasma membrane and finding out 380 how membrane binding is coupled with NMY - 2 activation are interesting questions to pursue 381 in the future . 382 383 Formation of linear ANI - 1 structures is modulated by the amount of F - actin 384 We discover that ANI - 1 not only localizes to cortical patches ( Lewellyn et al . , 2010 ; Maddox et 385 al . , 2005 ) , but also to some linear structures during cytokinesis in the one - cell C . elegans 386 embryo . After the reduction of formin - nucleated F - actin , numerous linear ANI - 1 structures form 387 and circumferentially align around the cell equator . How could F - actin limit the formation of 388 linear ANI - 1 structures ? We speculate that when unbranched F - actin levels are high , ANI - 1 389 binds F - actin and distributes along the filaments , which limits contacts between ANI - 1 390 molecules or restrains extension or flexibility of the disordered ANI - 1 N - terminus . When 391 unbranched F - actin levels are low , such as in the case of CYK - 1 depletion , ANI - 1 N - termini 392 are free , accessible to self - interact and form linear structures . In the complete absence of F - 393 actin ( Latrunculin A treated embryos ) ANI - 1 first forms circular structures that become linear 394 at late anaphase time points . Since linear ANI - 1 structures were forming much slower in the 395 presence of Latrunculin A , short actin filaments might bridge adjacent linear ANI - 1 structures 396 to accelerate the process . We did not observe a change in ANI - 1 structure formation after the 397 reduction of Arp2 / 3 - generated branched F - actin suggesting that ANI - 1 preferentially binds 398 CYK - 1 - nucleated unbranched F - actin . Filamentous - type anillin was also observed along F - 399 actin bundles in unperturbed vertebrate cells ( Oegema et al . , 2000 ) , after myosin II inhibition 400 ( Straight et al . , 2005 ) and in Latrunculin A treated Drosophila cells ( Hickson and O’Farrell , 401 2008 ) . Thus , the competence of anillin to form linear structures may be a conserved feature 402 from worms to humans . 403 404 The C - terminal half of ANI - 1 concentrates at the cell equator in septin - dependent 405 circular structures 406 Anillin’s C - terminal half harbors three membrane interaction elements : the RBD , the C2 and 407 the PH domain , and each of them contributes to membrane localization of anillin in human 408 cells ( Liu et al . , 2012 ; Piekny and Glotzer , 2008 ; Sun et al . , 2015 ) . Importantly , the ANI - 1 C - term 409 forms circular and not linear structures in cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) and Latrunculin A treated embryos . The 410 localization of the ANI - 1 C - term to the membrane strongly depends on septins , thus C . elegans 411 ANI - 1 , similar to anillin in other organisms , should bind to septins via the PH domain ( Kinoshita 412 14 et al . , 2002 ; Liu et al . , 2012 ; Oegema et al . , 2000 ; Piekny and Glotzer , 2008 ) . Consistent with 413 the fact that septins are not essential for the formation of linear ANI - 1 structures , we observe 414 that the ANI - 1 N - terminal half , which lacks the predicted septin - binding region , is sufficient for 415 linear structure formation . Since ANI - 1 is reduced after septin depletion and septin recruitment 416 to the contractile ring also depends on ANI - 1 ( Liu et al . , 2012 ; Maddox et al . , 2005 ) , ANI - 1 and 417 septin stabilize each other on the plasma membrane . 418 After septin and CYK - 1 co - depletion , a residual pulsatile membrane localization of the ANI - 1 C - 419 term persisted . This could reflect direct binding to the plasma membrane and / or binding to active 420 RhoA . Given that the ANI - 1 C - term membrane localization strongly depends on septins , changes 421 in ANI - 1 C - term dynamics cannot be exclusively attributed to active RHO - 1 dynamics . Therefore , 422 employing the ANI - 1 C - term as a biosensor for active RHO - 1 ( Michaux et al . , 2018 ; Reymann et 423 al . , 2016 ; Tse et al . , 2011 ) should be done with caution . 424 425 The disordered N - terminus is sufficient for linear structure formation 426 The membrane - targeted N - terminal ANI - 1 half localized in linear structures . Further , our 427 mutant analysis of full - length ANI - 1 revealed that neither the MBD nor the ABD nor both 428 domains together are required for ANI - 1 linear structure formation in control and cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) 429 embryos . Only further shortening and removal the linker region prevented the formation of 430 linear structures and circular septin - dependent foci formed instead . Since the N - terminus of 431 Mid1p forms high molecular weight oligomers ( Celton - Morizur et al . , 2004 ) one possibility is 432 that the ANI - 1 N - terminus assembles into linear structures by self - interaction mediated 433 oligomerization . Furthermore , a liquid - liquid phase separation mechanisms might drive the 434 formation of linear ANI - 1 structures . Our structure prediction reveals that the N - terminus of 435 ANI - 1 is highly disordered but the C - terminus is not . This feature of ANI - 1 is conserved from 436 fission yeast ( Chatterjee and Pollard , 2019 ) to worms and humans . Disordered regions 437 frequently mediate the formation of biomolecular condensates by liquid - liquid phase 438 separation ( Ong and Torres , 2020 ) and indeed the disordered N - terminus of Mid1p forms 439 condensates in vitro ( Chatterjee and Pollard , 2019 ) . Liquid droplets are typically isotropic but 440 their shape and material properties are tunable in multiple ways . For example , isotropic liquid 441 condensates of FUS transform into spindle - shaped condensates when F - actin is incorporated 442 in the droplets ( Scheff et al . , 2020 ) or altering the concentration of the actin crosslinker filamin 443 influences the shape and properties of F - actin droplets ( Weirich et al . , 2017 ) . We speculate 444 that linear ANI - 1 structures could form by similar principles : the isotropic spherical shape of 445 the biomolecular ANI - 1 condensates is biased to an extended anisotropic form by additional 446 factors such as remaining F - actin polymers , other proteins or posttranslational modifications 447 of ANI - 1 . 448 15 Single deletion of the N - terminal MBD and ABD or both together ( ANI - 1 ∆48 - 460 ) did not cause 449 embryonic lethality or alter ANI - 1 localization in control and cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) embryos . Depletion 450 of septins strongly reduced the cortical fluorescence intensity of the ANI - 1 ∆48 - 460 mutant . Thus , 451 in addition to septins , the MBD and ABD redundantly contribute to equatorial enrichment . 452 Similarly , in human and Drosophila cells the MBD and ABD of anillin are not essential but 453 contribute to successful cytokinesis ( Jananji et al . , 2017 ; Piekny and Glotzer , 2008 ) . 454 455 The ANI - 1 N - terminus promotes furrow ingression after co - depletion of formin and 456 septins 457 During cytokinesis F - actin polymerization at the cell equator is induced by diaphanous - type 458 formins and CYK - 1 is the only diaphanous formin in C . elegans ( Severson et al . , 2002 ; Swan 459 et al . , 1998 ) . Moreover , none of the other formins was found to act redundantly with CYK - 1 460 during the division of early C . elegans blastomeres ( Davies et al . , 2018 ) . In CYK - 1 - depleted 461 embryos cleavage furrow ingression failed , but double depletion of CYK - 1 and septins could 462 restore furrow ingression similar to previous observations using a cyk - 1 temperature sensitive 463 allele ( Jordan et al . , 2016 ) . We found that after CYK - 1 depletion , ANI - 1 forms linear structures 464 that circumferentially align around the cell equator and cortical septin UNC - 59 levels increase . 465 This indicates that septins or the excess thereof , hinder cleavage furrow ingression in CYK - 1 - 466 depleted embryos . As septins bind ANI - 1 and contribute to ANI - 1 targeting to the cell equator , 467 a reduction in septin levels might weaken the interaction between ANI - 1 and the plasma 468 membrane , and consequently lead to increased mobility of ANI - 1 , which could facilitate the 469 interaction between ANI - 1 molecules and the interaction between ANI - 1 and NMY - 2 . We 470 observed that all cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) ; septin unc - 61 ( RNAi ) embryos fully ingress a cleavage furrow but 471 half of them fail in abscission and the furrow regresses . Septins are essential for abscission in 472 Drosophila and human cells ( Estey et al . , 2010 ; Kechad et al . , 2012 ) but not in C . elegans 473 embryos ( Green et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , our data suggest a functional redundancy between 474 unbranched F - actin and septins during abscission in C . elegans . 475 Our data suggest that the N - terminus of ANI - 1 interacts with NMY - 2 , since co - localization of 476 NMY - 2 and ANI - 1 after Latrunculin A treatment requires its presence . Consistent with that , 477 NMY - 2 was required for the circumferential alignment of the linear ANI - 1 structures . 478 Surprisingly , deletion of the putative MBD did not abrogate linear ANI - 1 structure alignment . 479 Thus , either the NMY - 2 binding region is not properly predicted and is actually located in ANI - 480 1’s ABD and / or linker region or NMY - 2 does not align ANI - 1 via direct binding . Since CYK - 1 - 481 depleted embryos only exhibit short - range cortical flows ( Naganathan et al . , 2018 ) , the 482 alignment of the linear ANI - 1 structures around the cell equator is unlikely to be flow - 483 dependent , as suggested for unbranched F - actin ( Reymann et al . , 2016 ) . Therefore we favor 484 16 alternative models where localized motor - activity of NMY - 2 and crosslinkers promotes 485 equatorial circumferential alignment ( Leite et al . , 2020 ) . 486 Furrow ingression was only supported by the ANI - 1 fragments that still formed linear 487 structures . Furthermore , those linear ANI - 1 structures circumferentially align around the cell 488 equator , similar to unbranched F - actin in control embryos . Therefore , it is tempting to speculate 489 that those structures mediate furrowing in septins and CYK - 1 - depleted embryos . Linear ANI - 490 1 structures could bridge the residual unbranched actin filaments so that NMY - 2 can bind to 491 them . Then , NMY - 2 generates force as a motor or tension as a crosslinker by interacting with 492 the remaining F - actin similar to what happens in normal contractile rings ( Leite et al . , 2019 ) . 493 However , since F - actin did not accumulate at the equator after CYK - 1 and septin co - depletion 494 and the ABD of ANI - 1 was not required for furrow ingression , we favor an alternative model . 495 We hypothesize that linear ANI - 1 structures represent a novel type of network that contracts 496 by biomolecular condensation . ANI - 1 is predicted to have numerous IDRs at the N - terminus , 497 and we showed that the N - terminus is sufficient for linear structure formation and furrow 498 ingression . IDRs are frequently found in proteins that form biomolecular condensates by liquid - 499 liquid phase separation . Recent reports demonstrate that biomolecular condensation can also 500 exert forces on cellular structures and alter the shape of membranes ( Ganar , 2021 ) . 501 Interactions between biomolecular condensates distributed along a DNA molecule pull the 502 DNA molecule into the condensates and thereby apply force to the DNA polymer ( Quail et al . , 503 2021 ) . The formation of biomolecular condensates of FUS on the surface of membrane 504 vesicles generates compressive stress and causes inward membrane bending ( Yuan et al . , 505 2021 ) . Strikingly , inward membrane bending was also observed when biomolecular 506 condensates formed on the cytoplasmic surface of yeast cells and this mechanism contributes 507 to actin - independent endocytosis ( Bergeron - Sandoval et al . , 2021 ) . We speculate that 508 condensation of linear ANI - 1 structures results in the contraction of the ANI - 1 network and 509 ultimately in the inward bending of the plasma membrane ( Fig . S11 ) . The contractile force 510 generated by ANI - 1 condensation is then propagated around the ANI - 1 network by NMY - 2 511 filaments , which bind and crosslink the ANI - 1 linear structures . As a first step , future work will 512 need to show that C . elegans ANI - 1 , like Mid1p from fission yeast , also undergoes liquid - liquid 513 phase separation , although we consider this to be highly likely due to the fact that the 514 disordered disposition of the N - terminus is highly conserved ( Chatterjee and Pollard , 2019 ) . 515 Linear ANI - 1 structures are also observed in wild - type embryos that have normal F - actin levels . 516 So , it is possible that ANI - 1 linear structures may assist with furrow ingression in a normal 517 situation and take over the process when unbranched F - actin levels are reduced . 518 In summary , we find that ANI - 1 forms linear structures and supports furrow ingression when 519 unbranched F - actin levels are low . Although actomyosin - dependent constriction is the most 520 actively investigated mechanism for cytokinetic furrowing , alternative ways have been reported 521 17 to exist . For example , furrow ingression is mediated in Dictyostelium and human RPE1 by the 522 opposite migration direction of the two daughter cells ( Dix et al . , 2018 ; Nagasaki et al . , 2009 ; 523 Neujahr et al . , 1997 ) , and in archaea by supercoiling of the elastic ESCRT - III filament ( Harker - 524 Kirschneck et al . , 2022 ; Tarrason Risa et al . , 2020 ) . Our findings highlight the existence of an 525 additional mechanism of cleavage furrow ingression that is likely to contribute to the enormous 526 robustness of cleavage furrow ingression during cytokinesis . 527 528 18 Figure Legends 529 530 Figure 1 Furrow ingression of cyk - 1 ( RNAi ) ; septin unc - 61 ( RNAi ) embryos requires ANI - 1 531 A ) During cytokinesis the formin CYK - 1 polymerizes the unbranched F - actin of the contractile 532 ring . In cyk - 1ts mutants no contractile ring forms and cytokinesis fails , but , surprisingly furrow 533 ingression was restored by depleting septin ( Jordan et al . , 2016 ) . 534 B ) Central plane images of embryos expressing the membrane marker mCherry : : PH - PLC d 1 535 and mCherry : : DNA ( Histone - H2B ) and treated with the indicated RNAi conditions .

A summary of the worm strains used is provided in Table S1 . 838 RNAi experiments were performed by injection or feeding and details of the RNAi experiments 839 are listed in Table S2 . For the generation of dsRNA for injection the target sequence was 840 amplified by PCR from cDNA or genomic DNA with sequence specific primers containing T7 841 overhangs on both sides ( Table S2 ) . The purified PCR product was used as a template for the 842 in vitro transcription reaction using the MEGAscript T7 kit ( AM1334 ; Invitrogen ) . dsRNA was 843 injected into young hermaphrodites mounted on 2 % agarose pads . After injections worms 844 were rescued on OP50 seeded NGM plates and incubated at 20°C for 24 - 28 h ( nmy - 2 ) , or 39 - 845 49 h ( cyk - 1 , ani - 1 , arx - 2 , septin unc - 59 , septin unc - 61 ) . 846 For feeding RNAi , L4440 vectors carrying part of the sequence of ani - 1 or perm - 1 were 847 obtained from the Ahringer library ( Source Bioscience ) , sequenced to confirm the gene target , 848 and transformed into HT115 bacteria . Briefly , the RNAi bacterial clones were grown until an 849 OD of 1 . 6 in 50 ml Lysogeny broth ( LB ) medium containing 12 . 5 µg / ml tetracycline and 50 850 µg / ml ampicillin overnight at 37°C . The overnight culture was centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min , 851 the supernatant was removed , and the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 . 5 ml LB medium 852 containing 12 . 5 µg / ml tetracycline , 50 µg / ml ampicillin , and 0 . 23 mg / ml IPTG ( isopropyl β - D - 1 - 853 thiogalactopyranoside ) . In parallel , unseeded NGM plates were dried for 1 h in a 37°C 854 incubator . Then , 100 µl of a 1 : 1 : 1 mix of 50 µg / ml ampicillin , 12 . 5 µg / ml tetracycline , and 0 . 1 855 µ g / ml IPTG was added . These treated plates were inoculated with 100 µl of bacterial culture . 856 To obtain permeabilized embryos in Fig . 4 , and S6 , the inoculated bacterial culture consisted 857 of 20 µl of bacteria expressing perm - 1 dsRNA ( Carvalho et al . , 2011 ) and 80 µl of LB ( perm - 858 1 ( RNAi ) alone ) , or 20 µl of bacteria expressing perm - 1 dsRNA and 80 µl of bacteria expressing 859 ani - 1 ( perm - 1 ( RNAi ) ) . The expression of dsRNA was induced for 5 h at 37°C , in the dark . 25 – 860 30 L4 stage hermaphrodites were added to the treated plates and incubated at 20°C for 45 - 48 861 h before dissection for imaging . 862 863 Embryonic lethality counts 864 To determine embryonic lethality after ani - 1 ( RNAi ) , young adult worms were injected with ani - 865 1 dsRNA and incubated at 20°C for 48 h . Afterwards , injected worms were singled on NGM 866 plates , incubated 20 h and sacrificed after 24 h . The number of larvae and dead embryos was 867 counted 24 h later . 868 869 Immunoblotting 870 28 For immunoblotting , worms were picked in MPEG ( M9 plus 0 . 05 % polyethylene glycol 8000 871 ( PEG ) ) buffer and washed three times . The volume of the MPEG buffer was reduced and 872 sample buffer was added to reach approximately 1 worm / µl . Worms were incubated at 95°C 873 for 5 min , followed by centrifugation at room temperature for 10 min at 20000 g to spin down 874 debris and subsequently 20 µl of supernatant were loaded in each lane ( Zanin et al . , 2011 ) . 875 Membranes were incubated with anti - Actin ( A - 1978 , Sigma , 1 : 6000 ) , anti - FLAG ( F1804 876 Sigma ; 1 : 2500 ) or anti - GFP ( 11814460001 Roche ; 1 : 600 ) primary antibodies . HRP - 877 conjugated rabbit ( 170 - 6515 Bio - Rad ; 1 : 15000 ) and HRP - conjugated mouse ( 170 - 6516 Bio - 878 Rad ; 1 : 7500 ) were used as secondary antibodies . 879 880 Mos1 - mediated single copy insertion ( MosSCI ) of ANI - 1 variants 881 For the gfp : : ani - 1 transgenes the genomic ani - 1 locus ( 6507 bp ) with its promotor ( 565 bp ) and 882 3 ` UTR ( 319 bp ) were cloned together with GFP into pCFJ350 by Gibson cloning . Exon 5 was 883 rendered RNAi resistant by amino acid codon shuffling ( Fig . S8B ) . For the ANI - 1 N - term variant 884 the PBS and the CX motif of RHO - 1 ( AA181 - 192 ) were fused to AA764 of ANI - 1 . We chose 885 this region as a membrane anchor , since it was sufficient for membrane localization and did 886 not exhibit any specific cortical enrichment during anaphase ( not shown ) . All transgenes are 887 listed in Table S3 . 888 Ani - 1 transgenes were integrated on chromosome II ( EG8079 ) using the MosSCI method 889 ( Frøkjær - Jensen et al . , 2008 ) . Young hermaphrodites were mounted on 2 % agarose pads 890 and injected with a mix containing the vector carrying the ani - 1 transgene , the transposase 891 ( pCFJ601 ) and co - injection markers ( pCFJ90 and pCFJ104 ) . Worms were singled on NGM 892 plates seeded with OP50 and incubated at 25°C for 7 - 10 days until starved . Wild type movers , 893 negative for the mCherry - tagged array markers , were checked for homozygous GFP 894 expression and correct integration was verified using PCR . 895 896 Fluorescence microscopy and image analysis 897 C . elegans gravid hermaphrodites were dissected in 4 µl M9 buffer on a 18x18 mm coverslip . 898 The embryos were mounted on a 2 % agarose pad by inverting the coverslip onto the pad and 899 then sealed with vaseline . Confocal images ( Fig . 1 - 3 , S1 - S5 ) were acquired using a Nikon 900 inverted microscope ( Eclipse Ti ) equipped with a confocal spinning disk unit , a 100x 1 . 45 - NA 901 Plan - Apochromat oil immersion objective and an Andor DU - 888 X - 11056 camera ( 1024x1024 902 pixels ) . The system was controlled by NIS Elements software . GFP and red - fluorescent probes 903 were imaged using 488 nm and 561 nm lasers , respectively , and for some experiments 904 transmission images were acquired in the central plane . Confocal images of Fig . 5 , S9 were 905 acquired on the Leica SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a white light 906 laser , 63x / 1 . 3 GLYC objective and a photomultiplier . To display images acquired on the SP8 , 907 29 a Gaussian Blur filter with a radius of 0 . 8 was applied to reduce noise . Cortical images in Fig . 908 4 , S6 were acquired on a spinning disk confocal system ( Andor Revolution XD Confocal 909 System ; Andor Technology ) with a confocal scanner unit ( CSU - X1 ; Yokogawa Electric 910 Corporation ) mounted on an inverted microscope ( Ti - E , Nikon ) equipped with a 60x 1 . 4 NA 911 Plan - Apochromat oil objective and solid - state lasers of 488 nm ( 50 mW ) and 561 nm ( 50 mW ) . 912 For image acquisition , 12x0 . 5 μm z - stacks were collected every 5 s by using an electron 913 multiplication back - thinned charge coupled device camera ( iXon Ultra 897 ; Andor 914 Technology ) . Acquisition parameters , shutters and focus were controlled by Andor iQ3 915 software . Wide - field fluorescent and DIC images in Fig . 6 and S10 were acquired on the Nikon 916 Ti2 - Eclipse microscope equipped with a CFI Apochromat 100x 1 . 49 NA oil objective and a 917 Prime 95B , A18E203001 camera . 918 Image analysis and quantification was performed in Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . All data 919 analysis was performed in Excel , Prism ( GraphPad ) or KNIME analytics 920 ( http : / / www . knime . org ) and figures were assembled with the Affinity Designer software . 921 For high - time resolution data , imaging was started during pronuclear migration with central 922 planes images acquired every 16 s ( Fig . 2 - 3 , 5 , S1 , S2D , S3 - 4 , S5A , S9 ) . At the time of NEBD 923 ( defined as the time point when the border of the nucleus was no longer visible in the DIC 924 channel ) imaging was stopped and resumed at the cell cortex before anaphase onset with a 925 time interval of 2 . 5 s ( Fig . 2 - 3 , S1 , S2D , S3 - 4 , S5A ) or 5 s ( Fig . 5 , S9 ) . 926 Fluorescence intensity along cortical plane images ( Figs . 5B , S1B , D , S2E , S3B , D , S4C , S5B , 927 S6F , ) was measured on raw images by drawing a wide line from the anterior to the posterior 928 cortex of the embryo . Cortical fluorescence intensity was normalized by dividing by the mean 929 cytoplasmic intensity measured in a rectangular box in the posterior region of central plane 930 images at the time of NEBD . The mean normalized cortical intensity was calculated for 101 931 intervals from the anterior ( 0 % ) to the posterior ( 100 % ) for each embryo . To correct the 932 fluorescent signal for bleaching , the mean cortical intensity was measured over time in a 933 rectangular box in the posterior region for each embryo . The mean fluorescence intensity 934 relative to the initial intensity was calculated for control embryos ( n≥11 ) for each time point 935 and used as a ‘correction coefficient’ . To correct for bleaching , the fluorescent intensity 936 measured at a specific time point was multiplied with the ‘correction coefficient’ of this time 937 point . 938 Directionality of ANI - 1 and LifeAct was determined on cortical images that were processed by 939 subtracting the mean fluorescence intensity measured outside the embryos . Subsequently a 940 Gaussian Blur filter with a radius of 0 . 5 was applied followed by an Unsharp Mask filter with a 941 radius of 2 pixels and a Mask Weight of 0 . 6 . Images were also rotated ( anterior – left , posterior 942 – right ) . To measure directionality a rectangular box was placed at the cell equator at selected 943 time points after NEBD and the ImageJ plugin ‘Directionality’ with the method local gradient 944 30 orientation ( Liu , 1991 ) was used . The orientation of ANI - 1 and LifeAct was classified into 45 945 bins from 0 – 90° orientation . The mean percentage of ANI - 1 and LifeAct structures with 0 - 20° , 946 reflecting anterior - posterior orientation , and 68 - 88° , reflecting circumferentially orientation , was 947 calculated for each embryo . 948 The number of linear and non - linear structures was analyzed on cortical images that were 949 processed as described for the directionality analysis . Additionally , the mean fluorescence 950 intensity measured at the anterior cortex was subtracted from the cortical image at the end . A 951 rectangular box was positioned at the cell equator ( anterior for ANI - 1 N - term embryos ) and the 952 length and width of all structures was determined manually . For each structure the length / width 953 ratio was calculated and structures with the length / width ratio < 4 were classified as non - linear 954 and structures with a length / width ratio ≥4 were classified as linear . 955 The contractile ring diameter was measured manually on central plane images acquired every 956 20 s starting at NEBD . The initial ring diameter NEBD was set to 100 % diameter width . 957 Embryos were filmed from NEBD of the first cell division until to onset of the second cell 958 division . 959 960 Latrunculin A treatment 961 Adult hermaphrodites that had been fed bacteria expressing perm - 1 dsRNA ( see above ) were 962 dissected , and permeabilized embryos were filmed in meiosis medium ( 25 mM HEPES , pH 963 7 . 4 , 0 . 5 mg / ml inulin , 20 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum , and 60 % Leibowitz - 15 medium ) 964 without compression ( Carvalho et al . , 2011 ) . 10 µM Latrunculin A ( Sigma ) was added between 965 metaphase and anaphase onset . At the end of each video , medium containing 33 µM FM4 - 64 966 ( Molecular Probes ) was added to the imaging chamber to confirm that the imaged embryo was 967 permeable . 968 969 6xHIS : : NMY - 2 cloning and NMY - 2 / MLC - 4 / MLC - 5 protein expression 970 NMY - 2 full length was amplified from C . elegans cDNA and cloned into the pACEbac1 971 expression vector using Gibson assembly with an N - terminal 6×Histidine tag followed by a 972 flexible linker ( GlySerGlySerGly ) . The primers used were oAC1233 - 5’ - 973 ACCATGGCTCTGGTAGCGGCACATCATCTCGACAAAAAGATGATGAG - 3’ ( forward ) and 974 oAC1234 - 5’ - TAGTACTTCTCGACAAGCTTTTAGTTGCGAACTGAGTCGCG GTCT - 3’ 975 ( reverse ) . The backbone was amplified from pACEbac1 vector using the following primers 976 oAC1235 – 5’ - AAGCTTGTCGAGAAGTACTAGAGGATCATAATC - 3’ ( forward ) and oAC1236 977 5’ - GCCGCTACCAGAGCCATGG - 3’ ( Reverse ) . Baculovirus expression of the 6xHIS : : NMY - 2 978 full - length / StreptagII : : MLC - 4 / StreptagII : MLC - 5 complex , cell lysates and tandem 979 streptactin / Ni - NTA affinity chromatography were performed as described previously for NMY - 980 2 HMM complexes ( Osório et al . , 2019 ) . The concentrated eluate of the Ni - NTA purification 981 31 was dialysed overnight in high salt buffer ( 10 mM MOPS , 500 mM NaCl , 3 mM NaN 3 , 1 mM 982 EDTA , 1 mM DTT ( pH 7 . 3 ) ) . Glycerol and DTT were added to a final concentration of 10 % 983 ( vol / vol ) and 1 mM , respectively . Aliquots were flash - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 984 −80°C . 985 986 PIP strips and immunoblotting 987 To analyze lipid binding , PIP strips ( Echelon Bioscience , P - 6001 ) were used according to the 988 manufacturer’s instructions . Each membrane consists of 16 spots : 15 contain several lipids 989 and 1 empty ( blank ) . Additionally , on the empty space on the top of the membranes , we 990 spotted two controls for proper detection consisting of 1 µL of each protein sample ( 0 . 5 – 1 µg ) 991 or 1 µL of the secondary antibody pre - diluted 1 : 100 ( secondary antibody control ) . The two 992 control spots were allowed to dry before proceeding with the protocol . Membranes were then 993 incubated with blocking solution ( 3 % BSA fatty - acid free ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in PBS ( Gibco , 994 Thermo - Fisher ) with 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) Tween 20 ) ( PBS - T ) for one 1 hr at RT . Membranes were then 995 incubated with 4 µg / mL of either StreptagII : : MLC - 4 or 6xHIS : : NMY - 2 / Strep - tag II : : MLC - 4 / 996 Strep - tag II : MLC - 5 complex in blocking buffer for 1 h at RT , followed by three washes in PBS - 997 T with gentle agitation for five minutes . To detect bound proteins , membranes were incubated 998 for 1 h at room temperature in blocking solution with mouse StrepMAB antibody ( IBA 999 Lifesciences , 1 : 750 , 2 - 1507 - 001 ) for Strep - tagII : : MLC - 4 detection or mouse anti - 6xHistidine 1000 tag antibody ( Millipore clone HIS . H8 , 1 : 2 , 500 , 05 - 949 ) for 6xHIS : : NMY - 2 detection . After 1001 washing , membranes were incubated with HRP - conjugated anti - mouse antibody at 1 : 5 , 000 in 1002 blocking solution and incubated for 1 h at RT . This was followed by another round of three 1003 washes and PBS was used for the final wash . All steps were performed under gentle agitation . 1004 Immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence using Pierce ECL Western Blotting 1005 Substrate ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and a ChemiDoc XRS + System with Image Lab Software 1006 ( Bio - Rad ) . 1007 1008 Statistical analysis 1009 Statistical analysis was performed in Prism ( GraphPad ) . Mean values are presented with error 1010 bars representing standard error of the mean ( SEM ) as indicated in the figure legends . For 1011 data with normal distribution a parametric ( two sided Student’s t - test ) and with non - normal 1012 distribution a Mann - Whitney test for was performed . 1013 1014 32 Table S1 : C . elegans strains used in the study 1015 Strain name Genotype Source N2 Wild type ( ancestral ) OD70 ltIs44 [ pie - 1p : : mCherry : : PH ( PLC1delta1 ) + unc - 119 ( + ) ] ( Kachur et al . , 2008 ) MG617 xsSi5 [ pie - 1p : : GFP : : ani - 1 AH - PH : : pie - 1 3’UTR + Cbr - unc - 119 ( + ) ] II ( Tse et al . , 2012 ) MDX29 ani - 1 ( mon7 [ mNeonGreen ^ 3xFlag : : ani - 1 ] ) III ( Rehain - Bell et al . , 2017 ) BV70 zbls2 [ pie - 1p : : LifeAct : : RFP + unc - 119 ( + ) ] Zhirong Bao LP229 nmy - 2 ( cp52 [ nmy - 2 : : mkate2 + LoxP unc - 119 ( + ) LoxP ] ) I ; unc - 119 ( ed3 ) III ( Dickinson et al . , 2017 ) SWG004 cyk - 1 : : gfp ( Reymann et al . , 2016 ) EG8079 oxTi179 II ; unc - 119 ( ed3 ) III ( Frøkjær - Jensen et al . , 2008 ) NK2225 unc - 59 ( qy50 [ unc - 59 : : GFP : : 3xflag : : AID ] ) I ( Chen et al . , 2019 ) ZAN23 nmy - 2 ( cp13 [ nmy - 2 : : gfp + LoxP ] ) I ; OD56 ( mCherry : : histone H2B ; ltIs44 [ pie - 1p : : mCherry : : PH ( PLC1delta1 ) + unc - 119 ( + ) ] This study ZAN348 ani - 1 ( mon7 [ mNeonGreen ^ 3xFlag : : ani - 1 ] ) III ; zbls [ pie - 1 : : LifeAct : : RFP + unc - 119 ( + ) ] This study ZAN351 nmy - 2 ( cp52 [ nmy - 2 : : mkate2 + LoxP unc - 119 ( + ) LoxP ] ) I ; unc - 119 ( ed3 ) III ; ani - 1 ( mon7 [ mNeonGreen ^ 3xFlag : : ani - 1 ] ) III This study ZAN368 nmy - 2 ( cp52 [ nmy - 2 : : mkate2 + LoxP unc - 119 ( + ) LoxP ] ) I ; unc - 119 ( ed3 ) III ; xsSi5 [ pie - 1p : : GFP : : ani - 1 AH - PH : : pie - 1 3’UTR + Cbr - unc - 119 ( + ) ] II This study ZAN371 cyk - 1 : : gfp , zbls2 [ pie - 1p : : LifeAct : : RFP + unc - 119 ( + ) ] This study ZAN373 Si192 [ pEZ379 ; pani - 1 : : GFP : ANI - 1 RE - WT ; cb - unc - 119 ( + ) ] II ; unc - 119 ( ed3 ) III This study ZAN375 Si193 [ pEZ388 ; pani - 1 : : GFP : ANI - 1 RE - ∆236 - 460AA ; cb - unc - 119 ( + ) ] II ; unc - 119 ( ed3 ) III This study ZAN376 Si194 [ pEZ389 ; pani - 1 : : GFP : ANI - 1 RE - ∆48 - 460AA ; cb - unc - 119 ( + ) ] II ; unc - 119 ( ed3 ) III This study 33 ZAN379 Si197 [ pEZ390 ; pani - 1 : : GFP : ANI - 1 N - term ( 1 - 764AA - PBS - CX ) ; cb - unc - 119 ( + ) ] II ; unc - 119 ( ed3 ) III This study ZAN382 Si200 [ pEZ391 ; pani - 1 : : GFP : ANI - 1 C - term ( ∆48 - 680AA ) ; cb - unc - 119 ( + ) ] II ; unc - 119 ( ed3 ) III This study ZAN383 Si201 [ pEZ387 ; pani - 1 : : GFP : ANI - 1 RE - ∆48 - 160 ; cb - unc - 119 ( + ) ] II ; unc - 119 ( ed3 ) III This study GCP22 ItIs157 [ pAC16 ; Ppie - 1 : : LifeAct : : GFP ; unc - 119 ( + ) ] ; unc - 119 ( ed3 ) III ; prtSi2 [ pAC71 ; Pnmy - 2 : : re - encoded nmy - 2 : : mCherry : : StrepTagII : : 3 ' UTRnmy - 2 ; cb - unc - 119 ( + ) ] II ( Osório et al . , 2019 ) GCP1126 unc - 59 ( qy50 [ unc - 59 : : GFP : : AID ] ) I ; ltIs37 [ pAA64 ; pie - 1 / mCherry : : his - 58 ; unc - 119 ( + ) ] This study 1016 34 Table S2 : dsRNA generation , T7 sequence is underlined 1017 1018 1019 Gene Oligonucleotide 1 Oligonucleotide 2 Source RNAi condition Concentration [ µg / µl ] cyk - 1 TAATACGACTCACT ATAGGTTGGAGTT CGATGCAGAAGA TAATACGACTCACT ATAGGTTGCCTTG TCAGGAACTGAA cDNA injection 0 . 5 - 1 . 0 nmy - 2 TAATACGACTCACT ATAGGAATTGAATC TCGGTTGAAGGAA TAATACGACTCACT ATAGGACTGCATTT CACGCATCTTATG cDNA injection 0 . 18 - 0 . 36 ani - 1 TAATACGACTCACT ATAGGAGCCGGAG TTGGAAAGCTG TAATACGACTCACT ATAGGCCTATTCTT TTCCAAACGTTGC genomic DNA injection 0 . 35 - 0 . 7 unc - 61 TAATACGACTCACT ATAGGAGCGTGTT AATGTGATCCCAG TAATACGACTCACT ATAGGTCCAGTCT CTCCATCTCCAATC genomic DNA injection 0 . 3 - 1 . 0 unc - 59 TAATACGACTCACT ATAGGTGGGAGCC AATAGTGAACTAC TAATACGACTCACT ATAGGCGATTCTT CTCATTCTTCGGC genomic DNA injection 0 . 3 arx - 2 TAATACGACTCACT ATAGGCAGCTTCG TCAAATGCTTG TAATACGACTCACT ATAGGTATTTCCAT GCAATACGCG cDNA injection 1 . 0 perm - 1 AATGTTTATGAACC CGAGCG TTCACGCAGTTGTT GACACA ( Carvalho et al . , 2011 ) feeding N .
