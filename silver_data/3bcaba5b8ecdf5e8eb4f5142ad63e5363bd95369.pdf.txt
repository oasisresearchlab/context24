Endosomal escape also helps viruses bypass endo - lysosomal degradation and presentation to certain toll - like intrinsic immunity receptors .

This assay is versatile , and can be adapted to other adenoviruses , and members of other non - enveloped and enveloped virus families . 3 Introduction Cell entry of viruses involves crossing of the plasma membrane , or an endosomal membrane following endocytic uptake . In fact , endocytosis is the major pathway for virus infections ( for recent reviews , see 1 , 2 - 5 ) . Enveloped viruses are well known to fuse their lipid membrane with the plasma membrane or the endosomal membrane , and thereby deliver their internal core structures into the cytoplasm . In contrast , the membrane penetration of non - enveloped viruses is less well understood , but equally important , since it gives rise to cytosolic viruses which are sensed by intrinsic and innate host defense systems ( for reviews , see 6 , 7 ) . Central to non - enveloped virus penetration is a virally encoded membrane lytic factor , which either forms a pore on the limiting membrane , causes disintegration , or locally modifies the host membrane composition ( reviewed in , 8 , 9 ) . This eventually enables the viral capsid to traverse the membrane barrier and access the cytosol . In intact non - enveloped viruses the membrane lytic factor is internal and its exposure requires a metastable capsid structure that can undergo structural rearrangements in response to cellular cues . The precise molecular mechanisms by which these membrane lytic factors bring about the virus penetration , or the host components that participate in the process , are poorly characterized . One issue that has hampered the progress is the lack of suitable assays that can quantitatively and directly measure virus penetration efficiency in infected cells . Human adenoviruses are non - enveloped icosahedral viruses , replicating in the cell nucleus with lytic release of progeny to the medium ( 10 ) . They are classified into seven species ( HAdV - A to G , 11 ) . The ~ 90nm outer capsid shell is formed by the major structural protein hexon and stabilized by minor cementing proteins ( 12 , 13 ) . Proteolytic processing of the cementing proteins by a virion - associated protease converts the capsid into a metastable structure that is capable of undergoing a stepwise uncoating during entry , and successful delivery of the viral genome into the nucleus ( 14 - 16 ) . Attachment and uptake of adenoviruses into cells are mediated by vertex - associated fiber and penton base proteins , respectively , after a distinct series of motion steps on the cell surface ( 17 ) . Coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor ( CAR ) 4 is the primary attachment receptor for species C adenoviruses , such as HAdV - C2 and HAdV - C5 ( 18 , 19 ) , whereas integrins ανβ 3 and ανβ 5 mediate virus uptake via clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 20 - 24 ) . In contrast , species B viruses bind to cells via CD46 or desmoglein 2 ( 25 , 26 ) , and are internalized by macropinocytosis ( 27 , 28 ) . Following internalization , HAdV - C2 / C5 viruses penetrate into the cytosol from an as - yet - unidentified early endosomal compartment ( 15 , 20 ) , whereas penetration of species B adenoviruses has been postulated to occur from late endosomes ( 29 ) . Escape of incoming adenoviruses from endosomes is dependent on the viral membrane lytic protein VI ( 30 , 31 ) . To expose protein VI from the inside of the virus , the virus uses CAR to engage in actomyosin - 2 - dependent drifting motions on the cell surface , and uses integrin binding for confinement ( 32 ) . These two counteracting motions lead to a mechanical strain that releases fibers and causes structural changes in the particle that enable efficient exposure of protein VI ( 32 ) . The escape of HAdV - C2 / 5 is apparently mediated by protein VI - induced disruption of an endosomal membrane , since HAdV - C2 / C5 can promote delivery of co - internalized 70 - kDa dextran , 25 nm parvovirus particles or membrane - impermeable bacterial toxins into the cytosol ( 31 , 33 - 35 ) . Furthermore , recombinant protein VI fragments liposomes in vitro ( 30 ) . Critical for membrane disruption is an N - terminal amphipathic α - helix in protein VI ( 30 , 31 , 36 , 37 ) . In HAdV - C2 _ TS1 mutant virus ( TS1 ) the capsid cementing proteins are unprocessed due to a point mutation in the viral protease ( 16 ) . This mutant virus is unable to undergo structural changes that enable penetration during entry , and the virus particles end up trapped in late endosomes / lysosomes ( 14 , 20 , 32 , 38 ) . A controversial question in the penetration of HAdV - C2 / C5 viruses has been the role of acidic endosomal pH . Although in vitro studies have shown that acidic pH can destabilize the virion structure and promote protein VI exposure ( 30 , 39 ) , fragmentation of liposomes by recombinant protein VI is a pH - independent reaction ( 30 ) . Furthermore , delivery of co - internalized dextran into the cytosol in HAdV - C5 infected cells has been reported to be unaffected by neutralization of endosomal pH by the vacuolar H + - ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 ( 33 ) . On the other hand , 5 inhibition of endosomal acidification has been reported to reduce cytosolic delivery of co - internalized bacterial toxins ( 35 , 40 , 41 ) , and overall viral infection efficiency ( 15 , 42 ) . However , none of these studies directly monitored cytosolic and endosomal virus populations in the infected cells . Here we report a single cell based imaging assay for direct quantification of cytosolic and endosomal viruses during entry into cells . Our results indicate that incoming HAdV - C2 / C5 particles rapidly and efficiently escape from endosomes , and that efficient membrane penetration does not require acidic endosomal pH . The assay is easily adapted to other adenoviruses , as exemplified by HAdV - B3 , and potentially also to other non - enveloped viruses . 6 Materials and Methods Cells and viruses HeLa cervical carcinoma cells , subline Ohio ( from L . Kaiser , University Hospital , Geneva , Switzerland ) ( 43 ) , human bronchial epithelial A549 cells and human embryonic retinoblast 911 cells were grown at 37°C under 5 % CO 2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM , Sigma ) supplemented with 7 . 5 % FCS ( Life Technologies ) and 1 % nonessential amino acids ( Sigma ) . Human adenoviruses HAdV - C2 , the penetration deficient mutant HAdV - C2 _ TS1 , HAdV - C5 and HAdV - B3 were grown in A549 cells , isolated and labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 ( Alexa - 488 , Life Technologies ) or atto - 565 ( Atto - tec , Germany ) as previously described ( 14 , 15 , 44 ) . HAdV - C5 _ EGFP , an E1 / E3 deleted mutant virus containing EGFP gene in the E1 region under the control of cytomegalovirus major immediate early promoter ( 45 , 46 ) , as well as the EGFP - expressing , non - replicating HAdV - B3 _ EGFP virus ( 47 ) , were grown in 911 cells . Streptolysin O ( SLO ) - penetration assay HeLa - Ohio or A549 cells were seeded on Alcian blue - coated glass coverslips ( 48 ) in 24 - well dishes ( 40000 cells / well ) and grown for 2 days . Alexa - 488 - labeled viruses ( ~ 0 . 5 µ g virus / well yielding about 10 - 200 bound particles / cell ) were bound to cells at 0°C for 60 min in RPMI - 1640 medium ( without NaHCO 3 , Sigma ) supplemented with 0 . 2 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , 20mM Hepes and penicillin / streptomycin ( = RPMI - BSA medium ) . The unbound virus was washed away and the cells in RPMI - BSA medium were placed into a 37°C water bath . After virus internalization , cells were placed on ice , washed twice with SLO - binding buffer ( 25 mM Hepes - KOH pH 7 . 4 , 110 mM potassium acetate , 2 . 5 mM magnesium acetate , 0 . 2 mM calcium chloride , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT ) and processed for Streptolysin O ( SLO ) - mediated perforation of the plasma membrane . SLO was kindly provided by M . Husmann and S . Bhakdi ( University Medical Center , Johannes Gutenberg - University Mainz ) , or , alternatively , purchased from Sigma . The SLO was pre - activated in SLO - binding buffer at room temperature ( RT ) for 5 min , just before use . The activated SLO was applied to cells in ice - cold SLO binding buffer and bound to the cell plasma membrane on ice for 10 min . The unbound SLO was washed away , and cells in 7 SLO - binding buffer were switched to a 37°C water bath for 5 min to allow oligomerization of SLO and pore formation . The exact amount of SLO needed to permeabilise the cells varied between 0 . 4 - 3 µ g per well depending on the SLO batch . After the pore formation step , cells were placed back on ice , washed twice with antibody - incubation buffer ( 25mM Hepes - KOH pH 7 . 4 , 110 mM potassium acetate , 2 . 5 mM magnesium acetate , 2 mM EGTA ) , and incubated with rabbit anti - Alexa - 488 antibody ( Life Technologies : antibody diluted in the antibody - incubation buffer ) on ice for 60 min . Unbound antibody was washed away , cells were fixed with 3 % paraformaldehyde ( prepared in 25mM Hepes - KOH pH 7 . 4 , 110 mM potassium acetate , 2 . 5 mM magnesium acetate ) at RT for 20 min , quenched for 10 min with 25 mM ammonium chloride in PBS , and permeabilised with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS at RT for 5min . Cells were blocked with 10 % goat serum , and stained with goat Alexa Fluor 594 ( Alexa - 594 ) - conjugated anti - rabbit antibodies ( Life Technologies ) , and with DAPI to identify the nuclei . Intact cells incubated with anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies in RPMI - BSA medium for 1h on ice were used to estimate the number of plasma membrane - associated viruses . SLO - treated samples fixed and permeabilised with Triton X - 100 before the addition of anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies ( so called TX - 100 samples ) were used to control the overall accessibility of the internalized virus for the antibodies . The samples were imaged with Leica SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope using 63 × objective ( oil immersion , numerical aperture 1 . 4 ) and zoom factor 2 . Excitations were at 405 nm ( DAPI ) , 488 nm ( virus ) and 561 or 594 nm [ antibody signal ; excitation was at 633 nm if Alexa Fluor 633 ( Alexa - 633 ) or Alexa Fluor 680 ( Alexa - 680 ) secondary antibodies were used ] . Stacks were recorded at 0 . 5 µ m intervals using 4 × averaging and sequential acquisition for the individual channels . Maximum projections of confocal stacks were analyzed by a custom programmed MatLab ( The Mathworks ) routine to score individual virus particles within single cells and to quantify the anti - Alexa - 488 antibody signal on the particles ( 49 ) . The MatLab routines used in this study will be made available upon request . The threshold value for positive antibody signal was determined by placing a virus image on an antibody image obtained from non - infected cells and taking the highest virus - associated antibody signal as a cut - off value . As with any thresholds , classification mistakes may occur due to particles that have values close to the threshold . With our procedure , less than 3 . 5 % of particles had values within 20 % of the threshold value ( see for example Fig . 1D ) , indicating that the thresholding errors 8 are small . Further , over 95 % of viruses in the TX - 100 samples had an anti - Alexa - 488 signal higher than the threshold value indicating that this thresholding procedure efficiently detected most of the viruses . Representative images shown in figures were processed with Image J applying the same changes in brightness and contrast to all image groups in the series ( http : / / rsbweb . nih . gov / ij / ) . For wild type ( wt ) HAdV - C2 and TS1 virus coinfection , unlabeled wt and Alexa - 488 - labeled TS1 were bound to HeLa - Ohio cells at cold to synchronize the infection , and subsequently internalized at 37°C for 30 min before permeabilization with SLO as described above . Mean number of bound wt viruses per cell was 99 , and 40 for TS1 . The wt and TS1 viruses in the SLO - treated cells were detected with mouse anti - hexon 9C12 antibody ( 50 ) and anti - Alexa - 488 antibody , respectively . Secondary antibodies were Alexa - 680 - conjugated goat anti - mouse and Alexa - 594 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit , respectively . The 9C12 antibody , developed by Laurence Fayadat and Wiebe Olijve , was obtained from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD and maintained by the University of Iowa , Department of Biology , Iowa City , IA 52242 . Simultaneous detection of surface , endosomal and cytosolic viruses in cells infected with Alexa - 488 - labeled wild type HAdV - C5 was carried out by first incubating intact cells with anti - hexon 9C12 antibody in RPMI - BSA medium for 1h on ice . After removing unbound antibodies , cells were permeabilized with SLO and incubated with anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies as described above . Secondary antibodies were Alexa - 633 - conjugated anti - rabbit and Alexa - 594 - conjugated anti - mouse . Particles that scored positive for 9C12 antibody were classified as surface viruses , and particles that were 9C12 - negative , but anti - Alexa - 488 - positive were classified as cytosolic viruses . Single antibody stainings were used to control that there were no signal spillover artefacts . To determine the effect of endosome neutralization on virus penetration , the cells were pre - incubated with Bafilomycin A1 ( Baf A1 , Sigma , 50 nM in growth medium ) , niclosamide ( Sigma , 5 µ M in plain RPMI - 1640 medium , 51 ) and NH 4 Cl ( 25mM in 9 RPMI - BSA pH 8 . 2 medium ) for 1h before the virus addition . Control cells were treated with dmso ( Baf A1 and niclosamide ) or the pH 8 . 2 RPMI - BSA medium ( NH 4 Cl ) . The assay was carried out as described above , except that virus binding and internalization were in media containing the drugs . To control the effectiveness of the drugs and NH 4 Cl , cells were incubated in RPMI - BSA medium containing 2 µ M Lysotracker DND - 99 ( Life Technologies ) at RT for 15 min after the drug pretreatment , washed twice with PBS and fixed with 3 % paraformaldehyde containing 3 µ g / ml Hoechst 33342 ( Sigma ) . EM assay for penetration HeLa - Ohio cells grown on Alcian blue - coated glass coverslips were pretreated with dmso ( control ) , Baf A1 or niclosamide for 1h as described above . Fifteen µ g of HAdV - C2 was bound to cells at cold and the virus was internalized at 37°C for 30 min in the presence of dmso or the drugs . Samples were processed for electron microscopy as previously described ( 20 ) . For quantification , digital micrographs were recorded in sections across the middle of the cells imaged at 50000x magnification as described ( 52 ) . The number of viruses at the plasma membrane , in endosomes and the cytosol was determined by manual counting . Assay for protein VI exposure HeLa - Ohio cells grown on Alcian blue - coated glass coverslips were pretreated with Baf A1 , niclosamide or ammonium chloride for 1 h as described above , and the drugs were present in the medium throughout the experiment . Atto565 - labeled HAdV - C5 was bound to cells at cold , and internalized at 37°C for indicated times . After internalization , intact cells were incubated with the 9C12 anti - hexon antibody on ice to tag virus particles at the cell surface . Cells were fixed with 3 % paraformaldehyde and processed for anti - protein VI staining ( see above , and 32 ) . Alexa - 680 - conjugated goat anti - mouse and Alexa - 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit were used as secondary antibodies . The samples were imaged as described above . A custom programmed MatLab routine was used to quantify protein VI signal on endocytosed viruses , that is , Alexa - 565 - positive , but Alexa - 680 - negative viruses . 10 Assay for incoming nuclear protein VII HeLa - Ohio cells grown on Alcian blue - coated glass coverslips were pretreated with dmso , Baf A1 or niclosamide for 1h as described above . HAdV - C5 was bound to cells at 37°C for 30 min in the presence of dmso or drugs , after which virus inoculum was removed and cells were either fixed with 3 % paraformaldehyde ( 30 min sample ) or further incubated at 37°C for 2 . 5 h in the presence of dmso or drugs before fixation ( 2 . 5 h sample ) . The samples were processed for immunofluorescence as described above . Anti - hexon 9C12 and Alexa - 488 - conjugated goat anti - mouse antibodies were used to estimate the number of virus particles bound per cell ( 30 min sample ) , and rabbit anti - protein VII ( 53 ) and Alexa - 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit antibodies were used to visualize nuclear protein VII dots in the 2 . 5 h sample . DAPI was used to mark the nuclear area . Cells were imaged as described above . Number of viruses per cell was analyzed by a custom programmed MatLab routine from maximum projections of confocal stacks , and the number of nuclear protein VII dots was analyzed by CellProfiler ( http : / / cellprofiler . org ) . Infection assays To determine the effect of Baf A1 on virus infection , HeLa - Ohio cells grown on 96 - well imaging plates ( Greiner Bio - one ) were pretreated with Baf A1 or dmso for 60 min as described above . HAdV - C5 _ EGFP or HAdV - B3 _ EGFP virus was bound to cells at 37°C for 30 min , after which virus inocula were removed and cells further incubated at 37°C for 17 - 18 h in growth medium containing dmso / Baf A1 . Alternatively , dmso / Baf A1 were added 2 h after removal of virus inocula . The samples were fixed , processed and imaged as described ( 32 ) . DAPI stain was used to mark the nuclear area , and custom programmed MatLab routine was used to determine the average nuclear intensity of the EGFP signal , which was taken as a measure of infection efficiency . To determine the effect of niclosamide on virus infection , HeLa - Ohio cells grown on 96 - well imaging plates were pretreated with niclosamide or dmso for 60 min as described above , HAdV - C5 _ EGFP or HAdV - B3 _ EGFP virus was then bound to cells at 37°C for 30 min , after which virus inocula were removed and cells further incubated at 37°C for 3 . 5 h in the presence of 11 dmso / niclosamide , followed by 13 - 14 . 5 h incubation in a drug - free growth medium . Cells were processed and analyzed as described for the Baf A1 experiment . Results Endocytosed HAdV - C2 rapidly escapes from endosomes Previous studies have suggested that species C human adenoviruses , such as HAdV - C2 and HAdV - C5 , escape from early endosomes by causing disruption of the endosomal membrane ( 15 , 20 , 30 ) . To quantitatively monitor the escape at single - cell level , we developed the assay outlined in Fig . 1A . The assay uses Alexa - 488 - labeled viruses , anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies and the bacterial toxin Streptolysin O ( SLO ) ( 54 ) . Virus particles are first bound to cells at cold to synchronize infection and cells are then switched to 37°C for virus internalization . After internalization , the plasma membrane of the infected cells is perforated by SLO . This allows access of anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies into the cytosol and decoration of cytosolic viruses by the antibodies . In contrast , virus in endosomes is not accessible to the antibodies . Incubation of the permeabilised cells with antibodies is done at cold in a buffer devoid of ATP to suppress penetration of virus after SLO - permeabilization . After the primary antibody treatment , cells are fixed , permeabilised and stained with secondary Alexa - 594 - conjugated antibodies , and imaged by confocal microscopy . Cytosolic virus particles are recognized by the dual Alexa - 488 and Alexa - 594 signals , whereas endosomal viruses have only the Alexa - 488 signal . Since viruses at the cell surface are also accessible to antibodies , the assay includes control samples stained with anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies without prior SLO - permeabilization . Fig . 1B shows representative confocal images of HeLa - Ohio cells infected with Alexa - 488 - labeled wt HAdV - C2 or the penetration - deficient TS1 virus . The majority of wt particles were accessible to the anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies 30 min post infection ( pi ) , unlike TS1 . Following uptake , TS1 particles are transported to late endosomes ( 20 ) , and this explains the clustering of TS1 ( Fig . 1B ) . To determine the kinetics and efficiency of wt virus penetration , HeLa - Ohio cells infected with Alexa - 488 - labeled wt HAdV - C5 were analyzed at 0 , 5 , 10 or 20 min 12 after virus internalization . Intact cells were first stained with mouse anti - hexon 9C12 antibody , then permeabilized with SLO and incubated with the rabbit anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies . After fixation , cells were permeabilized and stained with secondary Alexa - 594 - conjugated anti - mouse and Alexa - 633 - conjugated anti - rabbit antibodies , and imaged by confocal microscopy ( Fig . 1C ) . Particles positive for 9C12 were classified as surface particles , and particles negative for 9C12 , but positive for anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies were classified as cytosolic viruses . Surface stains at the 0 min time point indicated that Alexa - 488 - labeled HAdV - C5 was efficiently recognized by both antibodies . After 5 min , about 47 % of particles were at the cell surface and 39 % in the cytosol . The surface population decreased to 13 % and 1 % at the 10 min and 20 min points in time , respectively , and the cytosolic population increased to 67 % and 79 % , respectively . Note that the size of surface and cytosolic virus populations varied considerably from cell - to - cell at 5 min and 10 min post internalization . Since the endosomal virus population at any of the time points amounted only to maximum of about 20 % , this suggests that HAdV - C5 rapidly penetrates after endocytosis . A time course was done with TS1 - infected cells ( Fig . 1D ) . Unfortunately , we could not score surface , endosomal and cytosolic viruses within the same cell , since TS1 is not recognized by the 9C12 antibody . Instead , intact cells stained with anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies were used to estimate the size of surface virus population . Parallel SLO - permeabilized samples were stained with the same antibody to estimate the size of the cytosolic virus population . Significantly , the percentage of TS1 particles positive for anti - Alexa - 488 antibody was similar in the 5 min surface and SLO - treated samples . Since the endocytosed TS1 particles at this time point are expected to be in early endosomes ( 20 ) , this result indicates that early endosomes remain intact in the SLO - treated samples . Also the integrity of late endosomes appeared not to be compromised in the SLO - treated samples , since the vast majority of TS1 particles were not accessible to anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies after 30 min of internalization , a time point when viruses have reached the late endosomes ( 20 ) . TS1 virus preparations always contain some wt - like , penetration competent particles . A previous transmission - EM study estimated that 14 % of incoming TS1 particles were found in the cytosol at 30 min post internalization ( 16 ) . The 10 % mean penetration efficiency of TS1 at 30 min post internalization in the present study agrees well with 13 these previous results . If SLO - perforated TS1 - infected cells were fixed and permeabilised with Triton X - 100 prior to staining with anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies , then all TS1 particles became decorated with the antibody ( Fig . 1D ) . We next tested the penetration efficiency of TS1 in HAdV - C5 ( wt ) and TS1 co - infected cells to test the possibility that wt infection generally destabilized endosomes in the SLO - permeabilised cells . Unlabeled HAdV - C5 and Alexa - 488 - labeled TS1 particles were bound to HeLa - Ohio cells at cold and cells were permeabilised with SLO 30 min pi . As shown in Fig . 1E , HAdV - C5 particles were readily accessible to antibodies in the SLO - permeabilised cells . More TS1 particles were antibody - positive in cells co - infected with HAdV - C5 than in the single TS1 infection ( 3 % compared to 8 . 5 % ) , and the difference was statistically highly significant ( P < 0 . 0001 , two - tailed Mann - Whitney test ) . Previous results from our laboratory indicated that maximally 7 . 5 % of incoming HAdV - C2 co - localized with the early endosomal marker EEA1 , and that 65 % of HAdV - C2 - positive early endosomes were also positive for TS1 in wt and TS1 co - infected cells ( 20 ) . Thus wt virus is expected to enhance cytosolic delivery of TS1 in a co - infection situation , and this most likely explains the differences between TS1 single and wt - TS1 co - infections in Fig . 1E . Notably , the overall number of antibody - positive TS1 particles in the co - infection was low in comparison to wt virus infections . The data thus indicate that wt virus infection does not lead to nonspecific disruptions of endosomes in presence of SLO . So far , the experiments were done in HeLa - Ohio cells . We next tested the assay in A549 cells using Alexa - 488 - labeled HAdV - C2 ( wt ) or TS1 ( Fig . 2 ) . Parallel intact or SLO - permeabilized cells were incubated with anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies 20 min post virus internalization . A minor fraction of HAdV - C2 remained at the plasma membrane at this time point . The vast majority of HAdV - C2 in the SLO - treated cells was accessible to anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies indicating rapid and efficient virus penetration in these cells as well . The differences of intact and SLO - treated TS1 samples were not statistically significant . Taken together , the results suggest that our assay allows quantitative assessments of cytosolic and endosomal virus 14 populations . The results demonstrate that endocytosed wt HAdV - C rapidly and efficiently penetrates into the cytosol . Acidic endosomal pH is not required for efficient penetration of HAdV - C2 To neutralize endosomal compartments we used different compounds blocking low endosomal pH by three different modes of action , bafilomycin A1 ( Baf A1 ) blocking the v - ATPase ( 55 ) , niclosamide acting as a protonophore ( 51 ) and NH 4 Cl acting as a lysosomotropic weak base ( 56 , 57 ) . HeLa - Ohio cells were preincubated with the drugs for 60 min prior to cold synchronized infection with Alexa - 488 - labeled HAdV - C2 or HAdV - C2 _ TS1 . Control samples were treated with dmso ( Baf A1 and niclosamide ) or with pH 8 . 2 culture medium ( NH 4 Cl ) . As shown by the lysotracker DND99 stain , all three drugs efficiently neutralized acidic compartments in cells ( Fig . 3A ) . Baf A1 did not inhibit endocytosis of wt HAdV - C2 , since in the majority of cells > 95 % virus particles were inaccessible to anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies in intact cells ( Fig . 3B ) . The percentage of penetrated HAdV - C2 in control SLO - permeabilised cells varied between 16 . 5 - 89 . 1 % at 20 min pi ( mean 64 . 4 % ) . Although a greater number of cells displayed virus penetration efficiencies < 40 % in the Baf A1 - treated sample , the difference between control and Baf A1 samples was not statistically significant . The TS1 control indicated that endosomes remained intact in the SLO - permeabilised Baf A1 samples . A similar analysis for niclosamide treated cells 60 min pi showed that HAdV - C2 was efficiently endocytosed , and the drug did not compromise endosomal integrity , as indicated by the TS1 control ( Fig . 3C ) . Although HAdV - C2 escaped from endosomes less efficiently in niclosamide - treated cells ( P = 0 . 0011 , two - tailed Mann - Whitney test compared to the control cells ) , the mean penetration efficiency of HAdV - C2 was 63 . 2 % , far higher than that of TS1 . Similarly , the escape of wt virus to cytosol was significantly less efficient also in NH 4 Cl treated cells than in control cells ( Fig . 3D , 30 min pi ) , but again the overall penetration efficiency was relatively slightly affected , in agreement with Baf A1 or niclosamide treated cells . These results strongly suggest that acidic pH in endosomes is not needed for efficient penetration . This was in agreement with transmission - EM analyses 30 min post internalization . 15 No statistically significant differences were observed between control and Baf A1 , or control and niclosamide samples ( Fig . 3E and 3F ) . We next analyzed the effect of Baf A1 , niclosamide and NH 4 Cl on exposure of the viral membrane lytic protein VI . As previously reported ( 32 ) , protein VI is inaccessible to antibodies in intact virus particles ( 0 min sample , cold synchronized infection ) , but during early steps in the entry the virus undergoes structural changes that result in exposure of protein VI epitopes ( Fig . 4A ) . Externalization of protein VI is a prerequisite for efficient penetration ( 32 ) . HeLa - Ohio cells were pretreated with Baf A1 , niclosamide or NH 4 Cl for 1 h , atto - 565 - labeled HAdV - C5 was bound to cells at cold , and virus was internalized at 37°C ( Fig . 4B - D ) . We restricted the analysis to endocytosed particles because protein VI exposure occurs concomitantly or soon after endocytosis ( our unpublished observations ) . The average protein VI intensity on endocytosed particles in Baf A1 treated cells was slightly higher at 10 min pi than in control dmso treated cells ( Fig . 4B ) . Protein VI separates from the virus particle following escape of the virus into the cytosol ( 32 ) , and by 20min post internalization the protein VI intensity on endocytosed virions in Baf A1 and control samples was reduced to similar levels . No significant differences on protein VI signal on endocytosed particles were observed in control dmso or niclosamide treated cells at 10 min or 20 min pi ( Fig . 4C ) . Similarly , NH 4 Cl did not reduce protein VI exposure ( Fig . 4D ) . Taken together , these results support the conclusion that acidic pH in endosomes is not needed for efficient penetration of HAdV - C . Effect of endosome neutralization of nuclear import of protein VII and virus infection We tested the effects of Baf A1 and niclosamide on entry steps downstream of penetration , such as nuclear targeting of the genome - associated protein VII 2 . 5 h pi ( Fig . 5A , B , C ) . Low multiplicity of infection , resulting in 4 - 41 bound virus particles per cell was used in the assays , and Baf A1 and dmso treated cells bound virus with equal efficiency ( Fig . 5A ) . As previously described ( 53 , 58 ) , incoming protein VII is seen as discreet dots over the nuclear area ( Fig . 5B , nuclear area defined by DAPI signal ) . Quantification of protein VII dots per nucleus indicated that the number of 16 dots correlated with input virus , and similar numbers of dots were observed in dmso and Baf A1 treated cells ( Fig . 5C ) . Nuclear targeting of protein VII was analyzed in niclosamide treated cells as well . Protein VII puncta in niclosamide treated cells were , however , less discrete and appeared to be more diffuse than in control cells , thus hindering accurate comparisons of the signals in these two samples ( data not shown ) . Instead , we estimated the overall virus entry efficiency in Baf A1 or niclosamide treated cells by measuring the transgene expression from HAdV - C5 - EGFP , a non - replicating , E1 / E3 - deleted virus ( 45 ) . Surprisingly , Baf A1 treatment boosted infection efficiency by ~ 3 . 5 - fold 17 h pi ( Fig . 5D ) . However , this boost was not linked to penetration , since a significant increase in infection efficiency was also seen when Baf A1 was added 2h after removal of virus inoculum . Similar analyses of niclosamide treated cells showed that HAdV - C5 - EGFP infection efficiency was ~ 76 % of that in the control dmso cells ( Fig . 5E ) . Collectively , the data demonstrate that acidic pH is not required for virus penetration to the cytosol and nuclear import of viral DNA - associated protein VII , but pH neutralization by Baf A1 increases transgene expression . Acidic endosomal pH is not required for efficient penetration of HAdV - B3 Previous studies have shown that incoming HAdV - B traffic to late endosomes and lysosomes in larger extent than HAdV - C ( 29 ) . We used Alexa - 488 - labeled HAdV - B3 as a model to monitor the kinetics of subgroup B virus escape from endosomes , and sensitivity of the escape to neutralization of endosomal pH . HeLa - Ohio cells were permeabilised by SLO at 30 min pi showing that a significant number of viruses had penetrated into the cytosol as evidenced by their accessibility to anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies , but virus clusters that were negative for anti - Alexa - 488 signal were observed as well ( Fig . 6A , representative images ) . Quantitative assessment of uptake and escape showed that at 15 min pi , ~ 96 % of viruses were endocytosed , and on average ~ 40 % had penetrated into the cytosol ( Fig . 6B ) . At 30 min pi , the penetration efficiency was not significantly different from that at 15 min pi , but considerable cell - cell variability in the penetration efficiency was observed , similar to HAdV - C . Similar to HAdV - C , Baf A1 did not inhibit endocytosis of HAdV - B3 . Quantification of the Alexa - 488 and Alexa - 594 double positive particles indicated that HAdV - B3 penetrated as efficiently in the Baf A1 - treated cells as in the control cells 17 ( Fig . 6C ) . The difference in penetration efficiency of the virus in control compared to niclosamide treated cells was statistically significant , but the overall penetration efficiency was still high , even in the niclosamide sample ( Fig . 6D ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that acidic endosomal pH is not required for efficient penetration of HAdV - B3 . We were not able to analyze effect of the drugs on HAdV - B3 protein VI exposure or protein VII nuclear import , since our antibodies did not react with HAdV - B3 ( data not shown ) . Instead , we tested infection efficiency of a non - replicating HAdV - B3 _ EGFP virus in Baf A1 - treated cells 18 h pi ( 47 ) . If the drug was added 1h before the virus , ~ 4 . 6 - fold boost in the infection efficiency was observed ( Fig . 6E ) . The boost was significantly lower if the drug was added 2h after removal of the virus inoculum . A similar trend was observed in niclosamide treated cells ( Fig . 6F ) . Thus , both Baf A1 and niclosamide boosted HAdV - B3 - EGFP infection efficiency without having a large effect on the penetration step . Discussion In this study , we establish a new penetration assay for adenoviruses that quantitatively measures virus escape from endosomes at single - cell level . SLO - mediated perforation of the plasma membrane is used to introduce antibodies into the cytosol and accessibility of e . g . Alexa - 488 - labeled virus to anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies distinguishes cytosolic from endosomal viruses in the permeabilised cells . Techniques such as delivery of co - internalized dextran or bacterial toxins into the cytosol by virus - induced rupture of endosomes ( e . g . , 33 , 35 , 40 , 59 , 60 ) , or counting of viruses at the plasma membrane , endosomes and cytosol by EM ( e . g . , 27 , 28 , 61 ) have previously been used to estimate escape of HAdV - C and HAdV - B from endosomes . However , the co - delivery assays are bulk assays without single cell resolution , and most importantly these assays estimate virus penetration only indirectly . Furthermore , interpretation of the results from co - delivery assays can be complicated by the fact that HAdV - C induces macropinocytosis and leakage of macropinosomal contents into the cytosol ( 22 , 27 ) . This uptake pathway could be responsible for the delivery of bulk of the co - internalized dextran or bacterial toxins into the cytosol , but the macropinocytosis is not the infectious entry pathway at least for the HAdV - C ( 22 ) . The EM assay on the other hand directly estimates cytosolic 18 and membrane - associated virus particles , but the assay is cumbersome and requires very high MOI . The assay presented in this study can be used at high and low MOI . It is easy to set - up because the key components are commercially available - Alexa - 488 , anti - Alexa - 488 antibody and SLO . However , there is one limiting factor , the choice of cell lines . Not all cells can endure the SLO permeabilisation , and some cell types detach from the dish , for example , U2OS cells . In this study , we used the HeLa - Ohio clone and A549 cells . In agreement with previous studies ( e . g . , 15 , 29 ) , we found that HAdV - C2 penetrates very rapidly after endocytic uptake . In a cold synchronized infection , a large fraction of viruses had escaped into the cytosol already 10 min after switching the cells to 37°C . Furthermore , the overall penetration efficiency was > 60 % at 20 min pi . Characterization of the early entry events for other adenovirus species is lagging behind that of HAdV - C . Our assay here is readily adaptable to other adenoviruses , as exemplified by HAdV - B3 . We found that penetration of HAdV - B3 occurred rapidly , similar to HAdV - C2 . At 15 min post internalization the overall escape efficiency was about 40 % . The single cell resolution of our assay revealed considerable cell - to - cell variability in the virus penetration efficiency for both HAdV - C2 and HAdV - B3 . While the molecular basis of this variability is currently unknown , it is interesting to note that the externalization of the viral membrane lytic protein VI to the surface of the virus also occurs with different efficiencies in individual cells . There has been a long standing controversy regarding the role of acidic endosomal pH in adenovirus penetration ( 15 , 30 , 33 , 40 , 59 , 62 ) . Our escape assay indicated that efficient penetration of HAdV - C2 and HAdV - B3 occurs even if the pH in endosomes is neutralized . Furthermore , efficient exposure of the HAdV - C5 membrane lytic protein VI did not require acidic pH in endosomes . This was concluded from experiments using three distinct inhibitors to neutralize the endosomal pH : Baf A1 ( vacuolar H + - ATPase inhibitor ) , niclosamide ( proton carrier ) and ammonium chloride ( lysomotropic weak base ) . Although the penetration of HAdV - C2 was affected to different degrees by these three treatments , the lysotracker control indicated that all three conditions efficiently neutralized acidic compartments 19 in the cell . The differences in penetration must hence be due to other effects of the compounds than endosomal pH neutralization . Interestingly , especially Baf A1 and ammonium chloride significantly reduced HAdV - C2 penetration in a subpopulation of the cells , suggesting that other endosomal factors than pH enhance HAdV penetration . Interestingly , a mild acid ( pH 6 ) treatment of cells containing surface - bound HAdV - C2 increased the release of tritium labeled choline or 51 Cr from the cells compared to cells kept at neutral pH ( 62 , 63 ) . Possibly , low pH at the plasma membrane can substitute for an endosomal factor ( s ) in virus induced membrane perforation . Although Baf A1 and niclosamide had relatively minor overall effects on the penetration efficiency of HAdV - C2 and HAdV - B3 , a different picture emerged when the effect of these drugs was tested by EGFP - reporter viruses . In the case of HAdV - C5 _ EGFP virus , Baf A1 boosted infection efficiency by ~ 3 . 5 - fold , whereas niclosamide reduced the infection by ~ 20 % . In contrast , a significant infection boost was observed for HAdV - B3 _ EGFP virus , with both Baf A1 and niclosamide , possibly related to endosomal maturation which has been suggested to increase HAdV - C2 infection through autophagosome - endosome hybrid compartments ( 60 ) . Regardless , the data highlight that it is crucial to employ direct assays for on - target interpretation of interference and perturbation experiments . One intriguing observation in the current study was the rather low impact of co - internalized wt viruses on the penetration efficiency of the TS1 virus . The average penetration efficiency of TS1 in the co - infection was 8 . 5 % and 3 % in TS1 single infections . The TS1 virus escapes from endosomes inefficiently because it does not undergo the structural alterations that prepare the particle for efficient protein VI exposure ( 14 , 32 ) , but it interacts with CAR and integrins , and is internalized by clathrin - mediated endocytosis as the wt virus ( 20 ) . HAdV - C2 / C5 viruses penetrate from an as - yet - unidentified early endosomal compartment , since maturation of early endosomes to late endosomes is not required for efficient virus escape into the cytosol ( 20 ) . The observed low impact of co - internalized wt particles on TS1 penetration could imply that the two viruses are sorted to different endosomal 20 compartments following uptake . Alternatively , the rapid penetration of wt virus may simply reduce co - localization of the two viruses in the same endosome compartment . In summary , our study describes a quantitative single - cell assay for adenovirus escape from endosomes to the cytosol , a step that is poorly characterized at the molecular level . The assay can be used in combination with chemical inhibitors or possibly RNAi to probe for cellular regulators of the penetration step ( 64 ) . Single - cell assays are important since it is becoming increasingly evident that cell - to - cell variation is observed in many cellular phenotypes , including virus entry ( 64 ) . Correlation of virus entry and infection efficiencies with particular molecular or morphological properties of a single cell will give more accurate information about the molecular basis of a given event than an average phenotype acquired in a population assay . We expect that owing to its simplicity and reliability , the assay presented in this study also works for other non - enveloped viruses and even enveloped viruses , provided that they can be detected by an antibody in the selectively - permeabilised cells . Such an antibody can be directed against a viral nucleo - capsid protein or a chemical tag added to the virus , for example Alexa - 488 , as shown in this study for non - enveloped viruses .

Plasma membrane - associated and cytosolic viruses are detected in green by Alexa Fluor 488 ( Alexa - 488 ) plus red ( Alexa - 594 ) colors , whereas endosomal viruses are exclusively green ( Alexa - 488 ) . ( B ) Alexa - 488 - labeled HAdV - C2 wild type ( wt ) , but not the penetration - deficient Alexa - 488 - labeled TS1 particles are accessible to anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies in SLO - treated HeLa - Ohio cells 30 min after internalization . Images shown represent maximum projections of individual confocal stacks . In the merge image Alexa - 488 and Alexa - 594 double positive particles are yellow . Nuclei ( DAPI stain ) are blue . Scale bar = 10 µ m . ( C ) Quantification of surface and cytosolic viruses in cells infected with wt Alexa - 488 - labeled HAdV - C5 . Intact cells were stained with both the mouse anti - hexon 9C12 and rabbit anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies at 0 min , whereas at other time points intact cells were first incubated with the 9C12 antibody , then SLO - treated and incubated with anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies . Primary antibodies were detected by secondary Alexa - 594 - conjugated anti - mouse and Alexa - 633 - conjugated anti - rabbit antibodies . The plot shows percentage of virus particles positive for 9C12 ( 9C ; these particles represent surface particles ) and particles positive for anti - Alexa - 488 antibody , but negative for 9C12 ( Al ; these particles represent cytosolic particles ) . One dot represents one cell . Error bars represent the mean ± SEM . Numbers of cells and viruses analyzed are indicated . ( D ) Quantification of anti - Alexa - 488 positive particles in cells infected with Alexa - 488 - labeled TS1 . In SLO ( - ) samples , intact cells were stained with the antibody to estimate the number of viruses at the plasma membrane , whereas the parallel SLO ( + ) sample indicates the number of antibody positive particles in SLO - treated cells . Difference between SLO ( - ) and SLO ( + ) samples represents the cytosolic virus population . TX - 100 sample is an SLO - treated sample that was fixed and permeabilised with TX - 100 before staining with anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies . Error bars represent the mean ± SEM . Numbers of cells and viruses analyzed are indicated . 27 ( E ) The majority of Alexa - 488 - labeled TS1 particles are endosomal in cells co - infected with wt and TS1 viruses . Unlabeled wt HAdV - C5 and Alexa - 488 - labeled TS1 were co - internalized into the cells for 30 min before SLO treatment . Control cells were infected with Alexa - 488 - labeled TS1 alone . The SLO - permeabilised cells were incubated with mouse 9C12 anti - hexon and rabbit anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies at cold , fixed and treated with Alexa - 680 - conjugated anti - mouse and Alexa - 594 - conjugated anti - rabbit antibodies and DAPI . The right hand fluorograph shows that wt particles in the wt and TS1 co - infected cells were readily accessible to the anti - hexon antibody . The left hand panel shows the percentage of TS1 particles positive for anti - Alexa - 488 antibody in the TS1 single and the TS1 plus wt double infection ( one dot represents one cell ) . The difference between TS1 single and wt and TS1 double infection was statistically highly significant ( two - tailed Mann - Whitney test ) . Fig . 2 : Penetration of HAdV - C2 in A549 cells is rapid and efficient ( A ) The majority of Alexa - 488 - labeled wt HAdV - C2 ( upper panel ) , but not the Alexa - 488 - labeled TS1 particles are accessible to anti - Alexa - 488 antibodies in SLO - treated A549 cells 20 min after internalization .

Differences between control and niclosamide - treated samples in the wt infection were statistically highly significant ( two - tailed Mann - Whitney test ) . ( D ) Penetration efficiency in NH 4 Cl - treated cells . Cells were permeabilised with SLO at 30 min post virus internalization . Although differences between control and NH 4 Cl - treated cells in the wt infection were statistically highly significant , only in minority of NH 4 Cl - treated cells the wt virus penetration efficiency was similar to that of TS1 . ( E ) Two representative transmission electron micrographs of control cells 30 min pi , showing three cytoplasmic HAdV - C2 ( upper panel , arrowheads ) and an endosomal virus ( lower panel , arrow ) .

Fig . 4 : Neutralization of endosomal pH does not inhibit exposure of the viral membrane lytic protein VI ( A ) Immunofluorescence labeling of protein VI ( green ) in HeLa - Ohio cells infected with Ad5 - atto - 565 ( red ) . Ad5 - atto - 565 was bound to cells at cold and internalized at 37°C for 0 min or 10 min . Cells were fixed and stained for protein VI . Images 29 represent maximum projections of individual stacks . The protein VI - positive particles in the merge image are shown in yellow , and nuclei ( DAPI ) in blue . Scale bar = 10 µ m . ( B ) Protein VI exposure in infected Baf A1 - treated cells . The cells were pretreated with dmso or the drug for 60 min , atto - 565 - labeled Ad5 - wt particles were bound to cells at cold and internalized for the indicated times in the presence of dmso / drug . Intact cells were first stained with mouse anti - hexon 9C12 antibody on ice to tag surface particles , fixed , permeabilised with Triton X - 100 and stained with rabbit anti - protein VI antibodies . Secondary Alexa - 680 - conjugated anti - mouse and Alexa - 488 - conjugated anti - rabbit antibodies were used to detect the 9C12 and anti - protein VI antibodies , respectively . Nuclei were stained with DAPI . Samples were imaged by confocal microscopy and images from maximum projections of confocal stacks were analyzed by a custom programmed MatLab routine to quantitate the Alexa - 488 - signal on endocytosed virus particles ( atto - 565 - positive , but Alexa - 680 - negative viruses ) . The plot shows mean fluorescent protein VI signal on endocytosed particles ( arbitrary units : one dot represents the mean value from one cell ) . Error bars represent the mean ± SEM . Protein VI signal on endocytosed viruses in Baf A1 - treated cells was slightly , but statistically significantly , higher than that in control cells at 10 min post virus internalization ( two - tailed Mann - Whitney test ) . Numbers of cells and viruses analyzed are indicated . Protein VI separates from virus particles after penetration , which is indicated by the reduced protein VI signal on viruses 20 min post - internalization . ( C ) Protein VI exposure in infected , niclosamide - treated HeLa - Ohio cells . The experiment was carried out as in ( B ) . ( D ) Protein VI exposure in infected , NH 4 Cl - treated HeLa - Ohio cells . The experiment was carried out as in ( B ) . Fig . 5 : Nuclear delivery of incoming viral DNA associated protein VII and viral transgene expression are not inhibited by low pH - neutralization ( A ) Dmso and Baf A1 treated cells bind similar amounts of virus . HeLa - Ohio cells were pretreated with dmso or 50 nM BAFA1 for 1h . HAdV - C5 was bound to cells at 30 37°C for 30 min in the presence of dmso / Baf A1 . Unbound virus was washed away , cells were fixed and immunostained with anti - hexon 9C12 antibody and DAPI for nucleus . Samples were imaged by confocal microscopy , and analyzed by custom programmed MatLab routine . The plot shows number of viruses per cell ( one dot represents one cell ) . The error bar represents the mean ± SEM . Number of cells and viruses analyzed are indicated . The differences between dmso and BAFA1 samples were not statistically significant . ( B ) Immunofluorescence labeling of protein VII in HeLa - Ohio cells infected with HAdV - C5 for 3 h . Images shown represent maximum projections of confocal stacks ( protein VII , green ) or a single confocal section ( DAPI , blue ) . Incoming protein VII is seen as discreet dots over the nuclear area . Staining of non - infected cells is shown as a control for signal specificity . Scale bar = 10 µ m . ( C ) Quantification of nuclear protein VII dots at 3 h post virus internalization indicates that nuclear import of protein VII occurs as efficiently in Baf A1 - treated cells as in control cells . Error bars represent the mean ± SEM . The number of nuclei analyzed is shown below the plot . Comparison of samples infected with 60 ng or 30 ng of virus indicate that the number of nuclear protein VII dots correlates with input virus . ( D ) Baf A1 boosts HAdV - C5 _ GFP infection . Cells were pretreated with dmso or Baf A1 for 60 min , a non - replicating HAdV - C5 _ GFP reporter virus was bound to cells for 30 min at 37°C and the cells were further incubated at 37°C for 17 h in the presence of dmso / Baf A1 ( - 60min sample ) . Alternatively , dmso / Baf A1 was added 2 h after virus binding ( + 120min sample ) . Cells were fixed , stained with DAPI , and imaged by automated fluorescence microscopy . The average intensity of EGFP over a DAPI mask was quantitated by a custom programmed MatLab routine . The effect of the drug treatment on cell viability ( estimated by cell adhesion ) is indicated by the cell number . The values represent mean values from three parallel samples ±SD . Since Bafilomycin A1 boosted infection efficiency even when added 2 h after virus binding , the boost is not connected to penetration . ( E ) Niclosamide slightly reduces the infection efficiency . HeLa - Ohio cells were pretreated with dmso / drug for 60 min . Virus was bound to cells at 37°C for 30 min and cells were further incubated at 37°C for 3 . 5 h in the presence of 31 dmso / niclosamide , followed by 14 . 5 h incubation in drug - free medium .
