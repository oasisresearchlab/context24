This question is critical because it drives many wide - ranging activities today . For example , how should we be educating and training our engineers and designers ? What design processes should we be implementing in our organizations ? Data - driven design is described as a " true paradigm shift " ( Cantamessa et al . , 2020 ) that will profoundly change design practice . AI is predicted to reshape how organizations are structured and how product design and innovation are managed ( Verganti et al . , 2020 ; Haefner et al . , 2021 ) . New trends and tools in product development , including shorter product lifecycles and AI - based tools , require data and alter established product development processes ( Bickel et al . , 2019 ) . With recent advances in AI , there may be many new opportunities including more customized designs ( Cantamessa et al . , 2020 ) and new business models ( Bstieler et al . , 2018 ) . However , there may also be many potential pitfalls , e . g . , over automation ( Levy et al . , 2021 ; Norman , 2007 ) . The broader research question is then : What actions should design managers take to ensure the best possible outcomes for designers , organizations , and product users in this new data - driven design environment ? The literature on data - driven design can appear quite daunting ; it is an interdisciplinary area disseminated in a multitude of disciplinary research outlets , represented by diverse and inconsistent terminology . This paper is one of the first to discuss data - driven design from the perspective of design management . A comprehensive literature survey of more than 200 books and papers from a variety of disciplines , including design , cognitive science , organizational theory , design management , human computer interaction ( HCI ) , philosophy , etc . has been employed to distil some of the fundamental concepts and perspectives to inform approaches to the research question and practical implications for design managers ( and perhaps even design educators ) . The results may be surprising , because they imply different training and management directions than may be currently taken . This paper is structured as follows . Section 2 reports on some of the methodological challenges of synthesizing the literature on data - driven design , providing an overview of definitions and general characteristics of the literature . Section 3 provides a synthesis on the potential impacts of data - driven design on designers , organizations , and users . Building on this foundation , in Section 4 , we offer some implications for design management , while Section 5 describes conclusions and future work . 2 METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGE TO SURVEYING THE LITERATURE ON DATA - DRIVEN DESIGN 2 . 1 General approach , challenges , and considerations The first author has more than 20 years of experience in new product development , both as an engineering designer and as a manager . As such , the approach to the literature review is very broad and informed by this experience . To understand data - driven design , it is first important to understand the theories of design practice , e . g . , Schon ( 1983 ) , Simon ( 1973 ) , Cross ( 2011 ) , and Bucciarelli ( 1994 ) . Similarly , to understand the management of data - driven design , an appreciation for organizational theory is important , e . g . , Mintzberg ( 1990 ) , Ackoff ( 1979 ) . The approach to the literature survey is one of seeking answers framed by the complexity of real design practice , recognizing that design is just as much an outcome of culture and organizational processes as it is of technology and market forces ( Bucciarelli , 1994 ) , and that managers manage " messes " ( Ackoff , 1979 ) . A broad survey can be revealing because similar concepts are often found in different disciplines ( e . g . , management is arguably a design activity itself ) . The literature survey deployed here touches on a wide range of topics , to see data - driven design through different lenses , e . g . , improved design tools , improved design inputs , and possible design task distributions between AI and humans . In addition to design and management , review domains and topics included artificial intelligence ( e . g . , Mitchell , 2019 ) , HCI , cognitive science , abductive logic , motivation ( e . g . , Fischer et al . , 2019 ) , philosophy ( e . g . , Thagard , 2021 ) , and sensemaking ( e . g . , Weick , 1993 ) . The intention is not to be exhaustive but to provide a synthesis of ideas reflecting the complexity of the design environment into which data and AI are being introduced . A search for “data - driven design” on SCOPUS ( accessed Nov . 26 , 2022 ) resulted in 821 publications . A review of the keywords and abstracts showed that the term “data - driven design” is being used in a wide variety of fields , including mechanical engineering , controls , computing , design , civil engineering , landscape architecture , human factors , etc . Simply reviewing these abstracts in detail appears to require subject matter expertise from many fields . As such , the literature may be inaccessible to the typical ICED23 2527 design researcher . Other keywords and combinations were searched including " AI - driven design " ; " data - driven " and " design " and " innovation " ; " data - driven engineering " ; " data - enabled design " ; " design analytics " ; " new product development " and " design " and " data analytics " ; and " artificial intelligence " and " design " and " creativity " . Many publications which are arguably about data - driven design are not classified as such , e . g . , Bstieler et al . , 2018 ( AI , innovation ) ; Jarrahi , 2018 ( AI , decision - making ) ; Ma and Kim , 2016 ( data - driven product family design ) ; McCaffrey and Spector , 2018 ( human machine collaboration , innovation ) ; Verganti et al . , 2020 ( " AI - empowered design " ) ; Wilberg et al . , 2018 ( data strategy , connected products ) ; Zhang et al . , 2021 ( AI , design ) . In addition , some papers are very high - level , e . g . , Bstieler et al . ( 2018 ) , Cantamessa et al . ( 2020 ) or “overly positive” , with little discussion of return - on - investment , sustainability concerns or IP concerns . Finally , many case studies are only focused on data - centric companies , e . g . , Airbnb , Netflix ( Daugherty and Wilson , 2018 ; Verganti et al . , 2020 ) , with Tesla commonly presented as a rare example of data - driven design on a non - purely digital product ( Cantamessa et al . , 2020 ; Montagna and Cantamessa , 2019 ; Porter and Heppelmann , 2015 ) . 2 . 2 Defining " data - driven design " The number of papers on “data - driven design” has increased significantly since 2016 ( Bertoni , 2020 ) , yet it is difficult to find a common definition of the term . Trauer et al . ( 2020 , p . 6 ) define data - driven engineering as “ a framework for product development in which the goal - oriented collection and use of sufficiently connected product lifecycle data guides and drives decisions and applications in the product development process ” . Here , the emphasis is on data collected directly from the product , or “use phase” data ( Wilberg et al . , 2018 ) . Others consider a broader definition of data . Bertoni ( 2020 ) found that the “data” in most papers on data - driven design comes from natural language processing of online reviews and social media . Ma and Kim ( 2016 ) refer to “customer preference data” - historical transaction data as an input to data - driven design . In this paper , “data” will be defined more broadly , as in Cantamessa et al . ( 2020 ) . " Demand - side " data includes data from potential and actual customers , use phase data , data scraped from online reviews and forums , data collected from customer discussions , ethnographic observations , etc . , and from market research activities ( e . g . , surveys ) . " Supply - side " data includes data generated by the design firm , e . g . , collected from production systems , supply chain systems , etc . , and inputs and outputs from previous designs ( e . g . , specifications , test results ) . A big picture view of data - driven design is provided in Figure 1 . Figure 1 : Data processing in data - driven design It is also important to consider what is done with this data and who / what makes the decisions . There seems to be no clear consensus regarding what exactly “data - driven” means . The definition by Trauer et al . ( 2020 ) focuses on using the data to make design decisions . Some authors refer to “data - driven” as meaning decisions are made automatically by machines ( Pryszlak , 2019 ; Verganti et al . , 2020 ) . Some authors differentiate between “data - inspired” , “data - informed” and “data - driven” ( Aishah , 2020 ; Stewart , 2019 ) where data - driven decisions are made by machines , data - informed decisions are made by humans guided by data , and data - inspired refers to explorations inspired by data . There is also reference to “data - augmented” ( Werder et al . , 2020 ) , “data - enabled” ( Bogers et al . , 2016 ; Trauer et al . , 2020 ) and “data - led” ( Pryszlak , 2019 ) , all of which generally refer to human - made decisions guided by data . In the 2528 ICED23 current analysis , it is assumed that at least some of the data is analysed by either descriptive or predictive analytics , where predictive analytics can include statistical techniques , artificial intelligence and / or machine learning . Data integration is a major issue . For example , Norman ( 2013 ) highlights the trade - off between the “big data” collected via market research activities which is typically presented in “objective” numerical form and the “deep insights” collected from a relatively small number of people that are typically in the form of “subjective” observations . It is assumed that design decisions can either be made by a human designer , a machine or by a human - machine combination . 3 DATA - DRIVEN DESIGN : IMPACTS AND PERSPECTIVES On a system scale , data - driven design will have impacts for designers , for the teams and organizations they work in , and for product users . Design managers will need to consider all of these impacts . The following sections highlight impacts and perspectives for each of these groups . 3 . 1 Designers Researchers predict that data - driven design will have a significant impact on the role of designers . Some predict the need for more generalist designers with systems thinking skills who can coordinate the inputs from multi - disciplinary teams ( Agostini and Filippini , 2019 ; Marion and Fixson , 2021 ; Norman , 2007 ; Pereira Pessôa and Jauregui Becker , 2020 ) . Similarly , Verganti et al . ( 2020 ) argue that as some aspects of problem solving are automated , design becomes closer to leadership . Other literature predicts the needs for new fields such as “design analytics” , which is responsible for turning data into useful design insights ( Cantamessa et al . , 2020 ) . Many authors agree that designers will need to have better data analytics skills in the future ( Bertoni , 2018 ; Pereira Pessôa and Jauregui Becker , 2020 ; Yang , 2018 ) . In contrast to the need for more design generalists , some researchers call for designers who are very highly specialized and only temporarily assigned to design teams ( Marion and Fixson , 2021 ; Yoo et al . , 2012 ) . As AI becomes more commonly used to provide preliminary designs , the role of some designers may change from that of solution provider to “solution selector” ( Marion and Fixson , 2021 ) . Part of design research focuses on finding methodologies , processes and tools that can aid designers . Yet , many design methodologies are not actually used in industry , possibly because they are too complicated or are not field - proven ( Birkhofer , 2011 ) . So , in the context of data - driven design , which methodologies and tools would designers want to use ? According to Jarrahi ( 2018 ) , designers may be interested in using data - driven support when dealing with complexity , specifically in situations where there are many design - related inputs to be collected and analysed . Data can improve decision making , e . g . , through access to high - volume , high - variety , high - velocity data , and aid with novel concept generation , e . g . , by using use phase data to understand real use cases ( Wilberg et al . , 2017 ) . As AI - enabled design tools become more prevalent , Xin et al . ( 2018 ) highlight the importance of designing the systems used for data - driven design in such a way that designers ' needs are considered . Norman ( 2007 ) highlights the issue of over automation , where the automation is so effective that humans no longer need to pay attention . Data - driven design , if implemented in a non - ideal fashion , may impact the performance of high performing design teams ( Zhang et al . , 2021 ) by causing teams to trust AI when they should not . There is a need for effective human - in - the - loop systems that allow for the efficient design of machine learning iterations ( Xin et al . , 2018 ) . When people are out of the loop , it can be very difficult for them to intervene in the case of problems . Norman ( 2007 ) points out the importance of using care when automating to ensure that humans can retain their skills . For data - driven design to be successful , effective human - algorithm collaboration will be critical . 3 . 2 Design in the context of organizations Design processes and design outputs must meet the needs of businesses . Business strategy revolves around value proposition and design outputs are a critical part of that value proposition . As designs become “smart” , entire business models can change , for example , through ever - evolving designs that are sold as services rather than products . Relationships with customers also change ( Cantamessa et al . , 2020 ; Porter and Heppelmann , 2015 ) . For example , customer interactions may change from one - time purchases to ongoing support . Issues of customer data privacy and security also move to the forefront . Organizations are interested in reducing costs and risks associated with new product development . Wilberg et al . ( 2017 ) predicts that data - driven design will reduce the cost and risk of new product development by reducing information processing costs , improving decision making and enabling the ICED23 2529 exploration of new opportunities . Unfortunately , frameworks for incorporating data - driven design into the new product development process are still immature ( Bertoni , 2018 ) . Further , it is not yet clear which data analysis techniques ( e . g . , descriptive , predictive , or prescriptive ) are most effective at each stage of the new product development process ( Cantamessa et al . , 2020 ) . To achieve advantage , businesses may prefer radical innovations rather than incremental innovations as a means of capturing a greater portion of the market . However , radical innovations often take decades before they are commercially successful ( Norman , 2013 ) . It is important to understand whether data - driven design can drive radical versus incremental innovations in a business’ particular industry . There is some evidence that data - driven design may be best suited to evolutionary ( incremental innovations / optimizations ) , rather than revolutionary design since revolutionary design may rely more on insights rather than on quantitative data ( Wu et al . , 2020 ) . Nevertheless , there are a number of researchers who are investigating ways to use data to improve creativity ( Carmona Marques , 2021 ; Chen et al . , 2019 ; Luo et al . , 2021 ; McCaffrey , 2018 ) . Design is often studied as an individual activity , ignoring the business and organizational environment in which it occurs . However , the majority of design occurs in teams and organizations . Organizations are typically focused on improving performance , which involves reducing errors and increasing insights / innovation ( Klein , 2013 ) . Unfortunately , processes intended to reduce errors and increase predictability can have a negative impact on insights and innovation ( Gilson et al . , 2014 ; Klein , 2013 ) . As a result , organizational decisions and contexts can make the design environment more challenging . Garbuio and Lin ( 2021 ) argue that design frames are shaped not only by the experience and memory of design teams , but also by the strategic vision of organizational leadership . Data - driven design has the potential to impact this strategic vision . Much of the recent literature points to the many significant organizational and process changes that will arise as a result of data - driven design ( Haefner et al . , 2021 ; Wilberg et al . , 2017 ) . In manufacturing firms , the nature of the work in core functions , from product development to after - sale service , is being redefined , with increased required coordination among them ( Porter and Heppelmann , 2015 ) . Many researchers predict that design teams will need to become more multi - disciplinary , with closer relationships between design , marketing , IT and other departments ( Cantamessa et al . , 2020 ; Porter and Heppelmann , 2015 ) . Yoo et al . ( 2012 ) describe distributed design teams that are “heterogeneous” and temporary in response to the need for the integration of specialized knowledge . Marion and Fixson ( 2021 ) also highlight the temporary involvement of team members . Bucciarelli ( 1994 ) describes the design process as a social process of reaching consensus amongst participants . It is not evident how the social processes of temporarily formed teams would impact design outcomes . 3 . 3 User perspectives Norman ( 2013 ) reminds us that customers and end users are not necessarily the same person and that designers must fully understand the needs of both . Often , the needs of the customer are quite different from the needs of the user , adding to the complexity of the design problem . Much of the recent research on data - driven design appears to focus on business - to - consumer case studies ( Cantamessa et al . , 2020 ; Verganti et al . , 2020 ) . The amount and type of data available to businesses directly serving consumers may be different than the data that is available to businesses which serve other businesses . This may mean that different data - driven design approaches are needed for companies that sell to consumers versus other businesses . For example , businesses which sell to consumers may be able to mine more online reviews , meaning that the process of need finding may be different . Fundamentally , products are designed to meet the needs of users . However , users often aren’t aware of their needs ( Norman , 2013 ) . As such , evaluating the quality of a design from a user perspective requires value - based judgement ( Lawson and Dorst , 2009 ) . Sensors could be used to help understand user needs . However , sensors measure different things than people do . Human perception is not the same as physical sensing ( Norman , 2007 ) . Correct interpretation of the data is critical . Data - driven design may benefit users by enabling the provision of highly customized products ( Cantamessa et al . , 2020 ) , e . g . , by using data to understand and satisfy individual needs . However , the cost may be a loss of privacy . Algorithms and model assumptions are often not as ideal , transparent , or impartial as people assume ( O’Neil , 2016 ) . Similarly , Ackoff ( 1979 , p . 99 ) points out that " it is not feasible to measure , let alone include in a model , every relevant aspect of the styles of the decision makers and all others who hold a stake in a decision ” . This means that product users might not be best served by data - driven design . There are important trade - offs to be considered by product users . 2530 ICED23 4 IMPLICATIONS FOR DESIGN MANAGEMENT The preceding sections detail the many factors , stakeholders , and perspectives that design management must consider in adopting data - driven design practices . Unfortunately , like data - driven design , design management is a vague concept in the literature - it is an emerging discipline that is not well defined or understood ( Libânio and Amaral , 2014 ; Shigemoto , 2020 ) and research is relatively scarce with minimal empirical support ( Chiva and Alegre , 2009 ) . When combined with data - driven design , there is little guidance in the literature for design managers . According to Verganti ( 2011 , p . 387 ) , the challenge is " being first in finding the right application of technological opportunities " . This is exactly the situation facing managers and organizations today as they attempt to incorporate big data and AI into their design processes . While there is recognition of the importance of design management - that good design is the result of a well - managed process ( Carneiro et al . , 2021 , p . 198 ) , there is debate about what that managed process should entail . “ The need for that process to deliver exceptional products is often overlooked ” ( Moultrie et al . , 2007 , p . 362 ) . According to Dumas and Mintzberg ( 2010 , p . 37 ) " design cannot be managed like other activities " . Design management requires understanding the business context of the design ( Hands , 2018 ; Carneiro et al . , 2021 ) , ensuring integration of creative , technical , strategic and market considerations ( Chiva - Gomez , 2004 , Shigemoto , 2020 ; Tvedt and Dyb , 2019 ) , collaboration between interdisciplinary teams ( Moultrie et al . , 2007 ) , and prioritizing the user perspective ( Ozkan , 2021 ; Chiva - Gomez , 2004 ; Tuncer Manzakoglu and Dimli Oraklibel , 2021 ) . With this overview , the following ideas attempt to answer the question of what actions design managers should take to ensure the best outcomes for designers , organizations , and product users in this new data - driven design environment . Augmenting the skill of designers : Promote the integration of data - driven design into the designer ' s way of working . There is very little in the data - driven design literature that references the foundational theories of design practice , which seems to be an important oversight . If AI is to aid the design process , it should be integrated in such a way that it considers how humans actually design . One example is the use of AI to aid with information processing , especially as designers contend with increasingly complex situations with multitudes of inputs to be analysed ( Jarrahi , 2018 ) . Another example are ' primary generators ' , on which designers typically rely as initial design ideas ( Lawson and Dorst , 2009 ) . Algorithms can be used to search large spaces for primary generators as demonstrated by Fu et al . ( 2013 ) , who used algorithms to search for " near " and " far " analogies in patent data . A possible action for design managers is to ensure that designers have training in AI so that they can understand its capabilities and limitations in design situations . Augmenting the skill of designers : Promote data - driven design to help designers overcome cognitive limitations , e . g . , limited expertise , limited memory , fixation , bias , and bounded rationality . Data - driven design can be used to augment human intelligence in the design process . Human designers may exhibit a number of biases ( Chattopadhyay et al . , 2020 ) and / or have limited expertise . AI - based systems can provide potentially valuable inputs to the designers , e . g . , suggested software design improvements ( Brown , 2021 ) . However , such tools need to be used with caution . There is evidence that certain use of AI in design recommendation systems can negatively impact competence ( Levy et al . , 2021 ; Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . Further , certain AI recommendation systems have been shown to result in humans ceding agency to the AI ( Levy et al . , 2021 ) . A possible action is to increase designers ' awareness of their own cognitive limitations in designing and identify areas where AI could assist . Augmenting the skill of designers : Designing / adopting smart tools for designers - HCI considerations will be key . Some designers may find themselves creating AI - based design tools for other designers . Similarly , design managers may have to choose which AI - based design tools are used by their design teams . As highlighted earlier , many practices and tools that have been created to improve design are not actually used in practice . To aid AI - based tool adoption , it will be important to consider human needs for relatedness , autonomy , and competency ( Fischer et al . , 2019 ) in the design and deployment of these tools . The effective design of these tools may be critical to successful deployment of data - driven design . Performance improvements expected by utilizing AI in design can only be achieved if the designers actually trust and are willing to work with the AI ( Nandy and Goucher - Lambert , 2022 ) . A possible action is to ensure that designers have adequate training in HCI , so that they can create / recognize design tools that will augment human design skill . Improving design outputs for users : Integrate data - driven design with qualitative approaches like design thinking . There seems to be very little literature linking design thinking to data - driven design . ICED23 2531 Design thinking is popular set of principles and tools focused on user - centric design ( Micheli et al . , 2019 ) . Common tools include ethnographic methods , journey maps , prototypes , field experiments , etc . At first glance , design thinking ' s more qualitative approaches may seem orthogonal to data - driven design . However , digital and AI innovation are expected to change human - centred approaches ( Calabretta and Kleinsmann , 2017 ) . Data may help designers better implement user - centric design approaches ( Gorkovenko et al . , 2020 ) . For example , Ghosh et al . ( 2017 ) describe a case study in which shoes fitted with sensors are used to help understand wearers ' perceptions of product features . A possible action is to foster an appreciation for qualitative data and how it should be combined with quantitative data to make design decisions . A challenge in organizational settings may be to find the right balance / weighting between qualitative and quantitative data . Improving design outputs and design organizations : Take a systems thinking approach to data - driven design , considering benefits and costs / risks for all stakeholders . The intersection of data - driven design and systems thinking ( Arnold and Wade , 2015 ) is another area where there seems to be a gap in the literature . Algorithm inherent biases ( O ' Neal , 2016 ) - a significant cause for caution in using AI in design - may not be evident until you “zoom out” and look at system - wide , long - term implications . Further , designers must carefully consider where AI - based tools are introduced into the design flow and predict where in the system they might have unintended impacts on designers , organizations , and designs . Augmenting the skill of designers and improving design outputs : Keep a human in the loop for sensemaking / abductive logic . Abductive logic is considered to be an important part of design ( Dorst , 2011 ; Martin , 2009 , p . 26 ) . It is what we use to hypothesize creative solutions to design challenges based on available data and prior experience . Computers are not currently able to understand causality or analogy , nor can they use these to generate creative abductive hypotheses ( Thagard , 2021 , p . 205 ) . Thus , if the innovation process is fully automated as some anticipate ( Cantamessa et al . , 2020 ) , a critical part of the design process will be omitted . For designers to devise creative solutions , it is important that they understand the people and contexts that they are designing for . As such , a possible action is to ensure that designers have meaningful exposure to the social sciences and that there is intentional integration of that knowledge base in design education and practice . 5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper was motivated by a need to synthesize the literature on data - driven design into practical insights that are of relevance to design management . If this paper starts a dialogue between researchers in these interdisciplinary fields , the objective will have been met . If we consider the main tasks of design managers and the various ideas offered on data - driven design , an overall theme that emerges is that design management will require an even greater emphasis on integration / collaboration . This will include : • integration of new smart tools and data into design teams , with the goal of augmented human intelligence • increased integration between the interdisciplinary teams that collaborate on designs • integration of qualitative human - centred / design thinking methods with new data - driven paradigms • integration of data and algorithms with traditional design approaches , to overcome human cognitive limitations . Further , it becomes apparent that we need to train designers to be good at what computers won ' t be able to do for the foreseeable future . This includes sensemaking and abductive logic . In other words , we need to train designers to understand the people and situations they are designing for . Such competencies are often not high priorities in STEM education or in technical hiring criteria . Future work involves confirming these ideas in an empirical setting and attempting to disentangle the implications of these ideas . We can examine the extent to which these practices are happening or not and look for connections to design performance . Similarly , future research could investigate whether instilling the competences identified in this paper in student designers leads to better outcomes in practice . This paper identifies a number of gaps in the literature , particularly at the intersection of data - driven design with design management , design thinking and systems thinking . Further research in all these areas would be helpful to practicing design managers . 2532 ICED23 REFERENCES Ackoff , R . L .
