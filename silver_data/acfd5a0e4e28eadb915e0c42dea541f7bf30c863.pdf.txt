The model builds on the Constant et al . ’s theory of information sharing . We propose that perceptions of information culture , attitudes regarding information ownership and propensity to share , as well as task and personal factors inﬂuence people’s use of collaborative media . We found that task char - acteristics ( task interdependence ) , perceived information usefulness and the user’s computer comfort were most strongly associated with the person’s use of collaborative media . Consistent with Constant et al . ’s earlier ﬁndings , views of information ownership and propensity to share were signiﬁcantly related to use . Interestingly , use of electronic media for sharing information and contacting people was weakly associated with a more structured , closed information culture . This implies that heavy users and sharers want more structured information ﬂow in place , possibly due to their need to have reliable access to other individual’s knowledge and information . Contrary to suggestions in the literature , a fully open , organic information culture may not always be most desirable . Implications for knowledge managers , practitioners and researchers are suggested . q 2000 Elsevier Science B . V . All rights reserved .

Introduction Knowledge management rallies around developing an organizational capability to create and disseminate knowledge ( Nonaka and Takeuchi , 1995 ) . Organizational know - ledge assets will only grow at the rate at which the individuals are willing to share their experiences , insights , and wisdom with others in their work group , organization , and across organizations ( Kim and Mauborgne , 1998 ; Davenport and Prusak , 1998 ) . Verkasalo and Lappalainen ( 1998 ) suggest that the knowledge utilization process starts by the pro - vider being willing to share the knowledge they have . Motivation for the provider to be open and get involved is required for knowledge transfer . Along similar lines , one of the stages outlined by Gilbert and Cordey - Hayes ( 1996 ) in their knowledge transfer model is communication . This implies that one party is willing to give something or get something from the other party . Since one party has to be willing to give something or get something from another party , information sharing is a necessary element of knowledge management in organizations ( Ruggles , 1998 ) . Information sharing embeds the notion of ‘willingness to share’ . Volition distinguishes information sharing from involuntary information reporting . Information sharing is a “voluntary act of making information available to others… sharer could pass information on , but does not have to” ( Davenport , 1995 , p . 5 ) . In the interorganiza - tional context , voluntary information sharing has been found to be positively related to proﬁtability and productivity and negatively associated with labor costs ( Morishima , 1991 ) . The potential of greater information sharing is not always reached , however . When asked about the difﬁculties in managing knowledge in organizations , the number one difﬁculty cited is “changing people’s behavior” ( Ruggles , 1998 ) . When asked about difﬁculties of information sharing , again ‘people issues’ and particularly culture are cited as the biggest impediments ( Ruggles , 1998 ) . Alavi and Leidner ( 1999 ) argue that organi - zations where culture does not value and support information sharing will face difﬁculties in integrating knowledge - based systems into their organizations . Empirical ﬁndings back up these arguments . Ciborra ( 1996 ) reports how deﬁcient user perceptions of the media led to the disuse of a collaborative system . Orlikowski ( 1992 ) similarly describes how users tend to ‘fall’ into their traditional information values and forgo the possibilities introduced by the new collaborative system . Organizations are investing in collaborative information and communication systems to encourage and facilitate the sharing of information ( Davenport and Prusak , 1998 ) . However , they often quickly ﬁnd that technology alone does not motivate sharing ( Orlikowski , 1992 ; Davenport , 1994 , 1997 ) . By use of collaborative technology , we refer to the use of a computer - based system to accomplish information activities such as accessing , searching , sharing , storing , and publishing information in a computer network within a person’s work unit / department / organization ( i . e . internal information activities ) as well as external to the person’s organization ( i . e . external information activities ) . Computer - based collaborative systems ( intranets , electronic mail , list serves ) provide the promise of much increased information sharing within and across organi - zations . Such systems encourage sharing of ideas in a free - ﬂowing manner as well as in a form of structured repositories . Collaborative information systems are used to exchange both knowledge and information . Although it is important to distinguish S . L . Jarvenpaa , D . S . Staples / Journal of Strategic Information Systems 9 ( 2000 ) 129 – 154 130 between knowledge and information ( Nonaka and Takeuchi , 1995 ) , what gets transmitted electronically is either data or information . For information to be transformed to know - ledge , it must be acquired by someone who can give it meaning and context , and used within the speciﬁc time span of its relevance and currency ( Davenport and Jarvenpaa , 2000 ) . So far , few researchers have sought to understand the determinants of collaborative technology’s use for information sharing ( Finholt and Sproull , 1990 ; Constant et al . , 1994 , 1996 ) . In a related area of technology acceptance and use , a wealth of studies have examined task - technology - related factors and personal attitudes . For example , the tech - nology acceptance model ( TAM ) embeds the notion of perceived usefulness that captures the user’s perception of the task - technology ﬁt ( Davis et al . , 1989 ; Taylor and Todd , 1995 ) . Computer playfulness is one personal attitude factor that is used to understand the way a user might interact with a technology ( Webster and Martocchio , 1992 ) . The recent extensions to the technology acceptance model go beyond task and personal factors to take into account broader contextual factors . Venkatesh and Davis ( forthcoming ) examined extensions to TAM including social inﬂuence processes ( subjective norm , voluntariness , and image ) . This study explores possible determinants of the use of collaborative technologies for information sharing . Using ﬁeld based survey data , we explore the relative strength of information culture , and task and attitudinal factors on the use of collaborative media for information sharing . Our purpose in doing this is to identify factors that inﬂuence the use of electronic media for information sharing activities in order to provide guidance for high payoff areas for more directed studies and advice for knowledge managers . We will next advance the research model and hypotheses , followed by the research method , results , and implications for practice and future research . 2 . Conceptual background and the development of hypotheses Building on social exchange theory ( Kelley and Thibaut , 1978 ) , Constant et al . ( 1994 ) advanced a theory of information sharing . The purpose of the Constant et al . information sharing theory is to understand the factors that support or constrain information sharing in technologically advanced organizations . The theory goes beyond communications and information exchanges among friends and personal contacts to include “organizationally remote strangers they will never meet in person” ( p . 401 ) . According to Constant et al . ( 1994 ) , information sharing is affected by rational self - interest as well as the social and organizational context . Namely , they propose that “organizational culture and policies as well as personal factors can inﬂuence people’s attitudes about information sharing” ( p . 401 ) . The more the person believes that infor - mation sharing is “usual , correct , and socially expected workplace behavior” , the more they should be willing to share ( p . 404 ) . The sharing should also be higher when the technology attributes and conditions decrease the psychological costs of sharing ( e . g . user - friendly systems ) . Finally , the more interdependent a person’s work is on others , the higher the needs of self - interest and reciprocity are and hence the more likely the person is to share . S . L . Jarvenpaa , D . S . Staples / Journal of Strategic Information Systems 9 ( 2000 ) 129 – 154 131 While this theory of information sharing builds on the interdependence notions of social exchange theory , the original social exchange theory did not consider information exchange ( Kelley and Thibaut , 1978 ) . Constant et al . ’s ( 1994 ) extension of the theory to this new context was based on the assumption that people in organizations treat infor - mation sharing like other exchanges that are inﬂuenced by their social and organizational context . The context is important because it differentiates information sharing from those simple exchanges where individuals act simply from rational self - interest ( “I help you if you help me” ) . The interdependence notion in social exchange theory implies that orga - nizational context causes people to rise above their self - interest rational impulses to consider the long - term impacts of their actions . That is , the social and organizational context regulates information exchange via concerns people have for maintaining future relationships , the balance of power , image , and so forth . The stronger the inﬂuence of the social and organizational context , the less likely people’s behavior is driven strictly by task or personal determinants of information sharing and more by social and organizational determinants . Constant et al . ( 1994 ) tested parts of the theory in a series of laboratory studies . The key ﬁndings were that attitudes about different types of information sharing ( product versus expertise information ) are associated with different antecedents , and that people’s atti - tudes about sharing information are based on both rational self - interest and contextual factors . Speciﬁcally , Constant et al . found that attitudes toward social and organizational norms moderated the relationship between self - interest and attitudes toward information sharing . In our study , we explore empirically a wider range of antecedents of information sharing than did Constant et al . ( i . e . information culture , computer comfort and character - istics of computer - based information are antecedents in our study that were not part of Constant et al . ’s study ) . We also study the extent to which collaborative technology is used . Information culture , organizational information ownership , propensity to share , task interdependence , computer comfort , and characteristics of computer - based information are the antecedents to the use of collaborative technology . The data collection occurs in a ﬁeld study context to contrast the laboratory environment of the Constant et al . ’s ( 1994 ) study . The variables and associated hypotheses are described below and are presented in Fig . 1 . 2 . 1 . Information culture Although Constant et al . ( 1994 ) recognized the potential inﬂuence of cultural factors on information sharing behavior , they did not test it in their study . The Constant et al . ’s ( 1994 ) model also does not distinguish between organizational and information culture although in knowledge management literature , such a distinction is often made . Similarly , in discussions on communication ﬂows in distribution channels , there is a recognition of norms governing information behavior above and beyond organizational culture norms ( e . g . Mohr and Sohi , 1995 ) . According to Davenport ( 1997 ) , information culture repre - sents values and attitudes toward information and what ‘to do’ and ‘not to do’ related to information processing , publishing , and communication . Information culture originates from individual and organizational values and behavior related to information processing S . L . Jarvenpaa , D . S . Staples / Journal of Strategic Information Systems 9 ( 2000 ) 129 – 154 132 activities and leads to an implicit standardization device for dealing with information . Davenport ( 1997 ) describes several ways that information cultures can vary : open versus closed , factually oriented or rumor and intuition - based , internally or externally focused , controlling or empowering . Information culture also includes preferences for certain types of information channels or media ( telephone , face - to - face , electronic mail , video ) . For example , electronic mail use is associated with information culture values that put less emphasis on the role of hierarchy and position ( Finholt and Sproull , 1990 ) . In the marketing channel literature , information sharing between partners is argued to be affected by normative expectations that encourage an open , honest , dynamic , and frequent exchange of information ( Mohr and Sohi , 1995 ) . An implicit assumption in much of the writings on collaborative media and knowledge management is that organizations have a supportive information culture where information is viewed as an organizational resource that should be shared openly and freely without regard to the other person’s hierarchy , function , or class . The work of Davenport et al . ( 1992 ) on information politics makes a compelling case for how information culture can inhibit information sharing in techno - logically advanced environments . Davenport et al . ( 1992 ) concluded that “In the most information - oriented companies we studied , people were least likely to share information freely — as perceived by these companies’ managers . ” ( p . 54 ) . After all , “as people’s jobs and roles become deﬁned by the unique information they hold , they may be less likely to S . L . Jarvenpaa , D . S . Staples / Journal of Strategic Information Systems 9 ( 2000 ) 129 – 154 133 Fig . 1 . The research model . share that information — viewing it as a source of power and indispensability — rather than more so” ( Davenport et al . , 1992 ) . Information technologies can be thought of as artifacts that reﬂect social values and norms ( Robey , 1995 ) . If the norms encourage open ﬂow of information , then users would be expected to deploy the technology to enact the norm . Hence , we might expect open and organic information cultures to increase the use of collaborative information technologies . Open describes the degree to which members can get access to information and informa - tion ﬂows without any restriction imposed by the organization or by members of the organization . Organic refers to the lack of formal structures and order for processing and sharing information ( Scholz , 1990 ) . 1 Organic and open can be expected to be co - existing . Hence , we hypothesize : H1 : Open and organic information cultures are associated with the use of collaborative electronic media for information sharing . 2 . 2 . Organizational ownership of information Constant et al . ( 1994 ) proposed that information sharing is affected by the organization norms of property rights . Organizational ownership of information differs from a social norm and represents an organization norm . The construct deﬁnes the relationship between an individual who has information and the organization that possesses that information . One might expect that if it is believed that information belongs to the organization , then it follows that employees should be ready to share it with others . The norm emphasizes the idea that information , even if a product of the employee’s hard labor , is not his or hers to give or withhold selﬁshly , but must be used for greater organizational beneﬁt . The regard for the organization itself might be seen as the substitute for direct incentives or personal relationships in motivating people to share information . In a laboratory setting , Constant et al . ( 1994 ) distinguished between information as product versus information as expertise and found that people felt expertise was less of an organizational possession and more of a personal possession . Somewhat counter intuitive , people were willing to share expertise with others more freely than an information product . That is , people felt that expertise was more a personal possession and people appeared to be more willing to share this than an information product that they associated with an organization . Constant et al . ( 1994 ) explained the result by suggesting that people are more likely to share something that is theirs than a social good because the sharing of what they possess makes them feel needed , wanted and appreciated . Sharing is motivated by the power of self - expression and self - consistency . The empirical results on information sharing via computer networks portray a more complex picture , however . Giving information can be related to general organizational beneﬁt , but it can also be related to personal beneﬁt and self - esteem . In a study where Constant et al . ( 1996 ) examined the exchange of technical information among distant employees ( strangers ) through a large computer system , they found that information S . L . Jarvenpaa , D . S . Staples / Journal of Strategic Information Systems 9 ( 2000 ) 129 – 154 134 1 Scholtz uses different labels ( ‘frankness’ and ‘order’ ) but the deﬁnitions are equivalent . providers gave reasons of personal beneﬁt as often as reasons related to general organi - zational beneﬁts . That is , providing information to strangers helped advice givers to gain personal beneﬁts . Sharing increased self - esteem and personal identiﬁcation with the organization . In an institutional context where there is the absence of strong organizational norms of ownership , individuals might be therefore sharing information for the expression and consistency of the provider’s identity and value . Hence , we expect that the more people hold beliefs that information / knowledge is owned by themselves , the more willing they are to share it because sharing positively reﬂects their identity and self - worth . By extension , we then expect the opposite when people hold beliefs that information / knowledge is owned by the organization . Hence , we hypothesize that : H2 : Beliefs about organizational ownership of information / knowledge held by the individual are associated with low use of collaborative electronic media for information sharing . 2 . 3 . Propensity to share information Constant et al . ( 1994 ) also proposed that people’s propensities to share affects inform - ation sharing behavior , independent of the information possessor’s personal feelings about his or her coworkers and found support for this in their study . Propensity to share information is part of prosocial transformation behaviors . Acts like sharing and volunteer - ing are forms of prosocial behavior and are aimed at maintaining the well - being and integrity of others and the self ( Brief and Motowidlo , 1986 ) . Propensity to share information is a personal norm relecting the costs and beneﬁts of sharing . Beliefs that information sharing is expected workplace behavior could be acquired from , or reinforced by , information culture norms . That is , information culture relates to a broad social norm and the propensity to share information relates to a speciﬁc personal norm that is inﬂu - enced by the greater context . A personal norm relates to “‘what one should do about it’ or ‘whether this norm should be incorporated into my own belief system’” ( Osterhus , 1997 ) . People who have a propensity to share information weigh more highly the social and personal good from sharing compared to the cost of sharing . We suggest the following : H3 : Propensity to share is associated with greater use of collaborative electronic media for information sharing . 2 . 4 . Task interdependence Constant et al . ( 1994 ) manipulated self - interest directly in their study . We will explore self - interest through the task interdependence construct . The theory of task - technology ﬁt asserts that “for an information technology to have a positive impact on individual performance , the technology must be utilized , and the technology must be a good ﬁt with the tasks it supports” ( p . 213 ) . The theory advocates that the greater the congruence between the characteristics of the technology and tasks , the lower the cognitive infor - mation processing costs and the greater the satisfaction and favorable outcomes toward S . L . Jarvenpaa , D . S . Staples / Journal of Strategic Information Systems 9 ( 2000 ) 129 – 154 135 achieving individual and organizational goals ( Vessey , 1991 ; Goodhue and Thompson , 1995 ) . Support is found consistently in the IS literature for the effect of task - technology ﬁt ( e . g . Jarvenpaa , 1989 ; Goodhue and Thompson , 1995 ) . In the collaborative technology context , the theory implies that those whose work involves tasks that are interdependent of others should be motivated to use the collabo - rative ( networked ) technology more than those who act alone ( Goodhue and Thompson , 1995 ) . The characteristics of the technology match the nature of the work . Apart from the information culture that might promote sharing and a person’s own propensity to share , pure rational self - interest suggest that beneﬁts of reciprocity from communicating and sharing with others are increased when the person’s work is dependent on the efforts of other people in and outside of their organization . People whose work highly depends on others might face frequent changes in their work including the type of information they need . The interdependence and subsequent change might increase their use of collabo - rative electronic media in their work environment . Hence , we hypothesize H4 : Task Independence is associated with greater use of collaborative electronic media for information sharing . 2 . 5 . Computer comfort Many have argued that attitudes toward computers have important effects on the usage of computer systems in general ( Igbaria et al . , 1990 ) . Those with more positive attitudes feel more inclined to try technology in the ﬁrst place as well as explore more of its capabilities over time . It is also likely that those who use the technology develop positive attitudes toward it . Research on new technology adoption has consistently found attitudes about computers to be a signiﬁcant determinant of adoption and use ( Davis et al . , 1989 ) , although some studies have found the relationship to weaken as users gain experience with the technology ( Thompson et al . , 1994 ) . Webster and Martocchio ( 1992 ) found that those who were playful with computers had more positive attitudes about computers . They also suggested that those who were most playful were the least likely to need organizational policies to sustain their computer usage . We extrapolate from this that those who are more comfortable using computers are more likely to use collaborative technology to share information . Constant et al . ( 1994 ) did not include issues such as computer comfort in their study ; however , they did recognize that factors that reduce personal cost to share — including psychological cost — can promote information sharing . This recognition supports the inclusion of computer comfort as an antecedent in our study . Thus , we hypothesize H5 : Computer comfort is positively associated with greater use of collaborative elec - tronic media for information sharing . 2 . 6 . Perceived characteristics of computer - based information On the basis of pure self - interest , one can expect that the more positively one perceives S . L . Jarvenpaa , D . S . Staples / Journal of Strategic Information Systems 9 ( 2000 ) 129 – 154 136 information in computer networks , the more we can anticipate the use of the collaborative system including for information sharing purposes . The perceptions of information has been long recognized as an important inﬂuence on the use of computer - based information ( Daft et al . , 1987 ) . People have the underlying expectation that information technology provides people with higher quality ( more precise , new and up - to - date ) information and greater accessibility to data ( easy to get to , comprehend , and analyze ) . Kraemer et al . ( 1993 ) demonstrated that quality and accessibility are the most signiﬁcant determinants of perceived usefulness of information . We have no reason to believe that those would not be signiﬁcant determinants of information shared between two parties . The cognitive cost / beneﬁt theory argues that individuals consider different approaches to completing their work as having different beneﬁts ( in terms of arriving at a desired outcome ) and costs ( in terms of effort expended on reaching the outcome ( Payne et al . , 1993 ) ) . Using a computer system requires effort and people have been found to conserve the expenditure of effort in computer mediated environments ( Todd and Benbasat , 1994 ) . Hence , people who do not hold positive perceptions of computer - based information are unlikely to use collaborative systems , independent of information culture , or their task interdependence , because such systems require effort . Hence , we hypothesize H6 : Positive perceptions of computer - based information are associated with greater use of collaborative electronic media for information sharing . We now describe how the research model , summarized in Fig . 1 , was tested . 3 . Method This section describes the sampling method , construct measures , and analysis methods employed . 3 . 1 . Sample A university was selected for the survey setting . Universities are often characterized as knowledge organizations ( Goffee and Jones , 1996 ) . Large , state universities house many different disciplines and work environments with possibly differing information cultures , and use of collaborative technologies . The large state university selected for this study prided itself on having a well developed IT infrastructure . Virtually all ofﬁce - based staff ( i . e . our target population ) had PC’s with network connections . There was considerable interest and inﬂuence from the central administration to make the university more acces - sible to its external stakeholders through investments in web - based technologies . There was also a drive to eliminate paper from administrative operations and create a more collaborative research atmosphere in the university . In our study , the unit of analysis was an employee in a department . Questionnaires were sent to all academic staff ( 2550 people ) and all general staff who had administrative duties ( 1703 people ) , so a total of 4253 employees received the ques - tionnaire . To stimulate responses , a reminder letter was sent out two weeks later and respondents were given the option to participate in a draw for ten prizes of $ 100 each S . L . Jarvenpaa , D . S . Staples / Journal of Strategic Information Systems 9 ( 2000 ) 129 – 154 137 ( most people who completed the survey chose to participate ) . Completed questionnaires were received from 1125 individuals . Seventy - one questionnaires were returned unopened due to various reasons such as the person had left the university or was on leave . There - fore , an overall response rate of 27 % was achieved ( 1125 / 4182 ) . While this was a reason - able response given it was an unsolicited survey and it was fairly lengthy ( i . e . 12 pages ) , it does raise the potential for non - response bias . Use of the procedure suggested by Armstrong and Overton ( 1977 ) indicated no signiﬁcant differences between respondents and non - respondents on a variety of demographic variables included in the questionnaire . Table 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics of the respondents . 3 . 2 . Construct measurement The questionnaire contained multiple measurement items relating to each of the constructs in the research model . A pre - test , using faculty , graduate students trained in questionnaire design , and administrative staff , was carried out as suggested by Dillman ( 1978 ) . Where possible , scales that had demonstrated good psychometric properties in previous studies were employed . Appendix A lists the questionnaire items used to measure each construct and their sources . For three constructs ( use of collaborative electronic media , information culture , and task interdependence ) sets of items were generated based on reviews of previous relevant literature and expert opinion . S . L . Jarvenpaa , D . S . Staples / Journal of Strategic Information Systems 9 ( 2000 ) 129 – 154 138 Table 1 Sample demographics Count Column ( % ) Age 30 or younger 293 26 . 2 31 – 40 360 32 . 1 41 – 50 288 25 . 7 51 – 60 165 14 . 7 61 or older 14 1 . 3 Gender Male 475 42 . 4 Female 645 57 . 6 Educational background Secondary or High School 83 7 . 4 Diploma / certiﬁcate 92 8 . 2 Undergraduate degree 255 22 . 8 Postgraduate diploma 178 15 . 9 Graduate degree 511 45 . 7 Time with University Less than 1 year 158 14 . 1 1 – 5 years 481 42 . 9 6 – 10 years 255 22 . 8 11 – 20 years 156 13 . 9 Over 20 years 70 6 . 3 Time in present position Less than 1 year 293 26 . 2 1 – 2 years 304 27 . 2 3 – 5 years 266 23 . 8 Over 5 years 256 22 . 9 Use of collaborative electronic media was measured in the model with three scale scores . The ﬁrst measure , created by summing the eight items listed in Appendix A , captured the frequency of using electronic media to contact people and share information within the respondent’s university and outside the university . The second measure captured the frequency that respondents searched for and gathered electronic information and the third measure captured the frequency that respondents published and stored electronic information . To assess information culture , a nine - item semantic differential scale was developed based on Scholz’s ( 1990 ) six types of information behavior and three types suggested by Davenport ( 1995 ) . Higher scores reﬂect greater perception of having an open , organic information culture . Following the work of Constant et al . ( 1994 ) , organizational ownership of information and propensities to share were assessed in this study through vignettes . Vignettes are used to elicit social judgments on subjects that are sensitive and difﬁcult to observe . A vignette provides a “short , concrete story to which the subject responds in a variety of formats” assuming the role of a ﬁctitious character ( p . 403 ) . Vignettes also have drawbacks as they ask people about hypothetical situations that they may have never encountered ( Constant et al . , 1994 ) . The results from four vignettes were collapsed into two items to measure organizational ownership of information and four items of propensity to share information . See Appendix A for details of the vignettes and the corresponding measures . An eight - item scale was developed to assess task interdependence . Five questions assessed how much the respondent’s work depended on others . Three questions dealt with the nature of the information used ( i . e . degree of equivocality ) since using inform - ation with higher levels of ambiguity could potentially increase the need for interacting with others . An eight - item scale was constructed to assess the comfort level respondents felt using information technology . The scale captured aspects of both computer anxiety and com - puter playfulness . Four items were from the short form of the Computer Anxiety Rating Scale ( Heinssen et al . , 1987 ) developed by Compeau ( 1992 ) and four items were from the computer playfulness scale developed by Webster and Martocchio ( 1992 ) . Higher scores reﬂect greater comfort with computers . A short form ( seven items ) of the Kraemer et al . ( 1993 ) Characteristics of CBI ( com - puter based information ) scale was used . This scale asks a series of questions about perceived quality of CBI , accessibility to CBI , and cost of CBI use . In our study charac - teristics of computer - based information that were both within the respondents’ university and outside their university , was assessed . Higher scores reﬂect greater perceptions of CBI - based information being valuable . 3 . 3 . Analysis A structural equation modeling technique called Partial Least Squares ( PLS ) was chosen for analyzing the research model ( Wold , 1985 ) . PLS is a technique that uses a combination of principal components analysis , path analysis , and regression to simul - taneously evaluate theory and data ( Pedhazur , 1982 ; Wold , 1985 ) . The path coefﬁcients in a PLS structural model are standardized regression coefﬁcients , while the loadings can be interpreted as factor loadings . PLS is ideally suited to the early stages of theory S . L . Jarvenpaa , D . S . Staples / Journal of Strategic Information Systems 9 ( 2000 ) 129 – 154 139 development and testing — as is the case here — and has been used by a growing number of researchers from a variety of disciplines ( e . g . Birkinshaw et al . , 1995 ; Green et al . , 1995 ; Higgins et al . , 1992 ) . A detailed discussion of the implementation of PLS in an information systems context is provided by Barclay et al . ( 1995 ) , who also compare PLS and LISREL . The explanatory power of the model is tested by examining the size , sign , and statistical signiﬁcance of the path coefﬁcients between constructs in the model . The statistics for the paths are generated using a jack - kniﬁng technique ( Fornell and Barclay , 1983 ) . The predictive capacity of a PLS model can also be evaluated by examining the variance explained ( i . e . R 2 ) in the dependent ( or endogenous ) constructs . The objective of a PLS analysis is to explain variance in the endogenous constructs , rather than to replicate the observed covariance matrix as is the case with covariance structure techniques ( such as LISREL ) . One consequence of using a variance - minimization objective is the absence of overall ﬁt statistics for PLS models ( Hulland , 1999 ) . 4 . Results The results of the measurement model analyses are presented ﬁrst . This is followed by a formal test of the hypotheses . 4 . 1 . Measurement model assessment Two separate analyses were performed . An initial PLS run was carried out to identify items that were weak and should be discarded . This was done to ensure that the measure - ment model was adequate before proceeding with assessment of the structural model . Items that had either weak loadings ( i . e . generally less than . 50 ) or showed poor discrimi - nant validity were discarded . It was felt that it was reasonable to relax the rule of thumb of accepting items with loadings of . 70 or better , due to the exploratory nature of the work . Factor loadings in excess of 0 . 45 can be considered fair and loadings in excess of 0 . 55 can be considered good , according to Comrey ( 1973 ) . The trimmed model was rerun and re - assessed . Seventeen items of the original 51 items were identiﬁed as being weak and were dropped from the initial analysis ( Appendix A lists the items used in the ﬁnal analysis ) . Table 2 reports the resulting number of items per construct , internal consistency values , and average variance extracted ( a measure used to assess discriminant validity ) . Table 3 presents the inter - correlations of constructs . Table 4 presents the loadings of each item on each construct . Both Tables 3 and 4 can be used to assess the discriminant validity of the constructs . All the constructs had acceptable reliability and validity . 4 . 2 . Assessment of the structural model Assessment of the structural model was done in two steps . The predictive power of the model was assessed ﬁrst , followed by an analysis of the hypothesized relationships among the constructs . The results are summarized in Fig . 2 and Table 5 . S . L .

The predictive power of the model The model explained 29 . 2 % of the variance in the use of collaborative electronic media construct . Overall , the amount of variance explained by the model appeared reasonable . The exogenous variables would likely be only some of many things affecting the endo - genous construct , resulting in the relatively modest R 2 value . 4 . 2 . 2 . Hypothesis testing Table 5 contains a summary of the hypotheses , the path coefﬁcients obtained from the PLS analysis of the initial model , and the t - statistic values for each path . All six of the paths were statistically signiﬁcant . Five of these signiﬁcant paths were in the directions hypothesized , supporting the associated hypotheses . These results are discussed in the next section . S . L . Jarvenpaa , D . S .

The Fornell and Larcker ( 1981 ) internal consistency value is preferred for PLS analyses since it uses the observed loadings to more accurately reﬂect the relative importance of each of the underlying measures . Also , it is calculated independently of the number of items employed for a construct , resulting in a more robust assessment of internal consistency . Cronbach’s alpha values are presented for comparison . A value of 0 . 70 or larger for both Cronbach’s alpha and the Fornell and Larcker measure indicates adequate internal consistency . All the constructs in this study meet that criteria .

Discussion The study explored what inﬂuences the use of collaborative electronic media in an organization . We extended the Constant et al . ’s ( 1994 ) model of information sharing to include the use of collaborative media . We will discuss the ﬁndings related to each hypothesis in turn . Hypothesis 1 . We had hypothesized that an open , organic information culture would be positively associated with the use of collaborative electronic media but the results suggest a negative association . The weak negative association implies people who believe they have a more structured , hierarchic information culture , use electronic media more . Possi - bly the hierarchy requires more use of the media , or perhaps the media is used as one way to get around the closed internal information culture to access information that is not freely shared by nearby colleagues . This ﬁnding is contradictory to those in the literature that suggests an open information culture facilitates sharing activities . Also , it is possible that the individuals who are using the media ﬁnd the structured information culture facilitates the exchange of information . As far as we could determine , information culture has not been operationalized before so future studies are needed to both verify the psychometric properties of the measure and the relationship information culture has with other constructs . Hypothesis 2 . Consistent with Constant et al . ’s ( 1994 ) ﬁndings , we found that people who believed the information belonged to the organization were less likely to use collaborative media for sharing information . This supports Constant et al . ’s suggestion that people share information and knowledge more readily when they believe it is their own since they get more personal satisfaction out of doing so . Hypothesis 3 . As hypothesized , strong feelings of the likelihood to share information were associated with the actual use of the media for information sharing activities . This ﬁnding was as we expected that the attitudes and behavior are conceptually similar and reinforcing . These results , along with those for hypothesis 2 , indicate that signiﬁcant beneﬁts result if an organization can inﬂuence their employees’ views of the ownership of information and their attitudes towards sharing . Hypothesis 4 . The higher the interdependence of the respondents’ tasks , the more they used electronic media to share information , as predicted by the task - technology ﬁt theory . This relationship was among the two most substantive in the model suggesting that rational self - interest plays a critical role in information sharing . Collaborative tech - nologies allow people to easily exchange information and knowledge in both structured and ad hoc fashion facilitating interdependent operations among two or more people . If the capabilities of the computer systems match the task needs of their users , they are more likely to be used . Hypothesis 5 . The hypothesized relationship between computer comfort and the depen - dent variable was supported . The path from computer comfort to use of electronic collabo - rative media for sharing information was positive and statistically signiﬁcant . This implies that having adequate computer skills is important to facilitate information sharing and communication in an electronic media environment . Hypothesis 6 . This hypothesis was strongly supported . The use of electronic media for communicating and sharing was strongly associated with the beliefs that computer based S . L . Jarvenpaa , D . S . Staples / Journal of Strategic Information Systems 9 ( 2000 ) 129 – 154 145 information systems provide valuable information in an effective way . These ﬁndings suggest that organizations should enhance the perceived value of their computer - based information in order to increase the amount it is used and shared . 5 . 1 . Limitations Our results found signiﬁcant associations between all the constructs in the research model . Of course , such ﬁndings ultimately need to be replicated across other settings and over time before they can be fully accepted . For example , our study was in one setting and while universities are thought of as knowledge organizations , the generalizability from a university setting to private industry may be questionable . We also did not control for professional sub - cultures ( e . g . academic function versus administrative function ) . Since several of the measures used for the constructs were developed speciﬁcally for this study , further work in this area also will help strengthen the construct validity of the measures used . Even though our theoretical model suggests directions of the paths , making causal statements is beyond the scope of our analysis and study . The cross - sectional nature of our survey design limits our ability to draw causal inferences . Although such a survey is useful for identifying what set of relationships exist , it does not address why they exist . Future research efforts such as in - depth case studies would be valuable to expand our current understanding of information sharing and the role of the various constructs . 5 . 2 . Implications Theoretically , our study builds on Constant et al . ’s ( 1994 ) theory of information sharing and extends it by demonstrating that contextual factors , such as information culture and task interdependence , inﬂuence the use of electronic media for information sharing activi - ties . A need to use the media , seeing value in the information provided through the media , and having a reasonable level of comfort in doing so are important in leading to more usage and sharing . Having a positive propensity to share and a belief that the information is your own property also leads to more media use and sharing of the information , consistent with Constant et al . ’s ﬁndings . Our results should be useful to focus future research efforts on the Constant et al . ’s ( 1994 ) model . There is a need to extend the understanding of the organizational context factors in general and organization culture in particular . Information sharing is likely to be a much more context - dependent process than we have given it credit here . In their ﬁeld study paper , Constant et al . ( 1996 ) note that “it seems unlikely that , in the absence of a culture that supports information sharing …the kinds of information exchanges … we observed could be sustained for long” ( p . 131 ) . Organizational culture has long been argued to affect the consequences from information technology ( Robey , 1995 ) . Markus ( 1984 ) found that political and cultural barriers can play a signiﬁcant role in the adoption of technologies that alter the information ﬂows in an organization . When information is shared , it has traditionally tended to occur more within rather than across functions . Ashburner ( 1990 ) found that the power position of the personnel function was related to the beneﬁts from the personnel information systems . Kanungo ( 1998 ) studied the inﬂuence of organizational culture on computer - mediated communication and information S . L . Jarvenpaa , D . S . Staples / Journal of Strategic Information Systems 9 ( 2000 ) 129 – 154 146 access . He found that in organizations with task oriented cultures versus people oriented cultures , user satisfaction of the communication and information access was greater . Orlikowski ( 1992 ) found that “in competitive and individualistic organizational cultures — where there were few incentives or norms for cooperating or sharing expertise — groupware did not engender collaboration” ( p . 362 ) . We also encourage extending the model to take into account organizational information policies . Notably Constant et al . ( 1994 ) questioned whether it is realistic to assume that organizations could supervise or sanction information policies . Nevertheless , Davenport ( 1997 ) encourages organizations to take a proactive approach to changing the shared social norms of sharing by instituting organization policies . The suggested policies include creating a committee or assigning responsibility to addressing information use issues , clarifying the organization’s objectives for using and sharing information , and communicating what information should or should not be shared . Davenport ( 1997 ) speculates that the information policies that organizations adopt may range from more to less controlling depending on the existing organization’s culture . The marketing channel literature supports this proactive view to information sharing . Normative expectations can encourage higher frequency and more open ﬂow of information ( Heide and John , 1992 ) . Institutionalized rules and routines for sharing information were found to promote greater frequency and bi - directionality in information sharing ( Mohr and Sohi , 1995 ) . Additional variables that might be considered include national culture and organi - zational performance . For example , compared to businesses in Japan , it is argued that information is shared more in the US for emotionally satisfying or power related reasons ( Bozman , 1991 ) . The model might also beneﬁt from including more situational variables . Research on interorganizational information sharing also has found that sharing increases with perceived level of organizational task accomplishment and slack ( Schermerhorn , 1977 ) , suggesting that in times of distress , information sharing might be decreased both internally and externally — just when such sharing could prove especially beneﬁcial . Overall , we hope that our results are useful in encouraging future research to extend the Constant et al . ’s ( 1994 ) model including adding variables , as well as closer examination of why the relationships exist in the model . Practically speaking , ﬁrms that are trying to become knowledge - based organizations can use our results to focus their efforts on activities that will have the greatest impact on increasing the sharing of information . Our results speak to the role that the perceptions of CBI play in the use of media . Actions organizations could take to increase perceptions in the value of CBI systems would include training and designing web sites and systems such that the effort to use them was minimized . Increasing aptitude with the systems ( i . e . computer comfort ) used to retrieve and share information will also facilitate use . Our results on organizational ownership of information imply that if organizations want to increase the use of collaborative systems for sharing activities , they should promote activities that encourage people to take personal ownership of the information that they possess and possible give them incentives and recognition for their sharing activities . Managing these variables effectively can lead to greater sharing of information via electronic media , a crucial step in the process of extracting value from organizational knowledge . S . L .

Conclusion In conclusion , our results speak to the value of the Constant et al . ’s ( 1994 ) theory of information sharing . The Constant et al . theory is an important piece of work that has yet to receive the attention it deserves in information and knowledge management literature . We have found very few articles that make reference to the Constant et al . ’s ( 1994 ) theory of information sharing and have been unable to locate any substantive extensions to the work . Constant et al . ’s ( 1994 ) theory accommodates both organizational context factors as well as psychological factors including feelings , values , and self - identities . The model can be used to examine why people are or are not sharing their best information as well as knowledge regardless of the amount of technology , organizational mandate , or ﬁnancial incentive . It can be used to present a cultural driven approach to information and knowledge sharing . It can also be a basis of an emotional driven understanding of information sharing processes . Understand - ing and appreciating the role of human emotion is likely to be critical in moving beyond information sharing to knowledge sharing because without people feeling that they are part of the community that cares for them , they will not share their best knowledge . Because of its grounding in one of the fundamental theories of social psychology , social exchange theory , we believe that Constant et al . ’s ( 1994 ) theory is a robust basis to develop not just an information sharing theory , but moreover , a knowledge sharing theory . This theory complements the more economic perspectives to information sharing that deal with the logic of economic self - interest . Social exchanges of information and knowledge are similar to economic exchanges in the sense that there is an expectation of some future return for sharing , but unlike economic exchanges there is no understanding of the value of what has been shared and no clear expectation of exact future return . Particularly in the knowledge - sharing context , the value of what is being shared can be often determined only after it has been shared , at which point the receiver has it without any cost . The economic explanations do not adequately address situations where “individuals can go the extra mile even at the expense of their own personal self - interest” ( Kim and Mauborgne , 1998 , p . 324 ) . People have been found to share expertise in situations where individuals were to receive unfavorable decision outcomes , for example , sharing information to help reengineer a process when it was clear that they would be reengineering themselves out of the job . Rumelt ( 1991 ) called for disciplines other than economics to reveal insight into situations of coordination and accumulation of knowledge that went beyond simple exchanges and individual incentives . The Constant et al . ’s theory is a useful starting point of understanding social and psychological processes in knowledge sharing . Sharing knowledge is a critical step in developing intellectual capital and beneﬁts for organizations . We look forward to future extensions of Constant et al . ’s ( 1994 ) model . S . L .
