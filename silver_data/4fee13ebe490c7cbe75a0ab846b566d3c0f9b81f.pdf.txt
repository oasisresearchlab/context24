To 23 overcome scale up limitations of classical 2D culture systems , suspension cultures have been developed to meet 24 the need of large - scale culture in regenerative medicine . Despite constant improvements , current protocols relying 25 on the generation of micro - carriers or cell aggregates only achieve moderate amplification performance . Here , 26 guided by reports showing that hPSCs can self - organize in vitro into cysts reminiscent of the epiblast stage in 27 embryo development , we developed a physio - mimetic approach for hPSC culture . We engineered stem cell niche 28 microenvironments inside microfluidics - assisted core - shell microcapsules . We demonstrate that lumenized three - 29 dimensional colonies maximize viability and expansion rates while maintaining pluripotency . By optimizing 30 capsule size and culture conditions , we scale - up this method to industrial scale stirred tank bioreactors and 31 achieve an unprecedented hPSC amplification rate of 282 - fold in 6 . 5 days . 32 33 TEASER 34 Optimizing human pluripotent stem cells amplification by recapitulating and protecting biomimetic colonies in a 35 bioreactor 36 INTRODUCTION 37 38 Following pioneering works targeting Parkinson’s disease ( 1 , 2 ) , diabetes ( 3 , 4 ) , macular degeneration ( 5 ) or heart 39 failure ( 6 , 7 ) , cell therapies are now addressing an increasing diversity of indications ( 8 , 9 ) . Therapeutic cells 40 represent a hope for millions of patients worldwide with chronic diseases or unmet medical needs . For each of 41 those patients , the number of required cells range between 10 5 and 10 10 cells . While academic pre - clinical studies 42 or small - scale clinical trials have already been proved to be successful , a transition to true clinical scale is now 43 urgently needed . To enable treatment of thousands to millions of patients , production capacity must scale while 44 maintaining high - quality cells compatible with transplantation . 45 Due to their unlimited self - renewal capacity and potency to give rise to any cell type in the body , human 46 pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) hold great promise to provide the required quantities of therapeutic cells . In vivo , a 47 few embryonic stem cells can give rise to the 30×10 12 cells of the adult human body ( 10 ) while maintaining their 48 genome integrity . As a consequence , much effort has been dedicated to the isolation and in vitro culture of these 49 cells in physiological conditions . 50 Historically , the first stem cell lines were established by micro - dissecting embryos and manual passaging as two - 51 dimensional ( 2D ) adherent epithelial colonies on a layer of feeder cells ( 11 – 13 ) . Cell proliferation and 52 pluripotency maintenance were thus achieved in vitro . The need for an embryonic source was then alleviated with 53 the discovery that differentiated cells could be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSC ) ( 14 ) . 54 This breakthrough led to pioneer works in developmental cell biology and catalyzed the development of cell 55 therapy applications . Even though a lot of work has been devoted to the development of media and substrate 56 compatible with clinical use , topology of hiPSCs cultures has not been gathering the same attention . Nevertheless , 57 2D in vitro cultures suffer high mortality rates , spontaneous differentiation and genetic drift ( 15 ) . An estimated 58 40 - fold increase in the number of mutations compared to in vivo conditions ( 16 ) often results in rejection of 59 clinical batches due to safety concerns ( 17 , 18 ) . In addition , 2D culture systems have limited “scale - out” 60 possibilities : for example , generating 1 trillion pluripotent stem cells , would require almost 1000 m 2 of plastic 61 dishes and countless handmade passaging ( 15 ) . The non - scalability and the inability to conserve high quality cells 62 remain the main limitations of 2D culture systems for clinical applications ( 18 ) . 63 More recently , 3D hPSCs cultures have been developed to model developmental processes . After seeding stem 64 cells in bulk extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ( 19 , 20 ) or using microfluidic chips ( 21 ) , cell clusters self - organize into a 65 monolayered epithelium recapitulating numerous features of an epiblast that generates in vivo all tissues in an 66 amniote embryo through gastrulation . Even though these elegant approaches allowed to gain much insight into 67 morphogenesis mechanisms ( 22 ) , they are not designed for the production of hPSCs per se . 68 From a bioproduction perspective , significant advances have been achieved by developing 3D suspension cultures 69 and bioreactors . Whether hPSCs are grown as floating aggregates or adherent at the surface of microcarriers , 70 those systems provide increased surface - to - volume ratio and scale - up potentialities . Additionally , the use of 71 stirred - tank bioreactors ( STBR ) allowed better control of the culture parameters without direct human 72 intervention . Indeed , stirring - mediated mechanical agitation avoids sedimentation of the aggregates or 73 microcarriers onto the bottom of the culture vessel and heterogeneities in the culture medium compositions . 74 Nonetheless , one intrinsic drawback of agitation is that hydrodynamic shear induces cellular damages ( 23 ) . This 75 effect is all the more dramatic as the vessel increases in size : the larger the volume of the bioreactor is , the more 76 power per unit of volume needs to be injected for effective homogenization . Even though expansion rates with 77 hPSC aggregates are regularly increased and could reach up to 70 - fold within 7 days ( 24 , 25 ) , the ability of 78 scaling up the volume of the production is still restricted . Typically , this mechanical upper limit makes it difficult 79 to reach batches larger than 1 liter or equivalently few billion cells . Finally , the current bottleneck for industrial 80 scalability is the difficulty to fulfill simultaneously high amplification rate , volume and physiological quality . 81 In this work , by bridging the gap between two distinct communities , namely developmental biology and stem 82 cells bioprocessing , we show that recapitulation of hPSC niche - like micro - environments allows to optimize the 83 suspension culture of hPSC in STBRs . More precisely , we propose a system that utilizes a high throughput 84 microfluidic encapsulation technology compatible with suspension culture of stem cells in a bioreactor and 85 amenable to the production of large volume batches without any degradation of cell survival in contrast with 2D 86 colony - based systems for instance . Briefly , iPSCs are encapsulated in alginate hollow microcapsules internally 87 coated with ECM components at low cell seeding concentration . We assess the maintenance of stemness and 88 pluripotency upon 3D culture in suspension . We then characterize the cell growth inside the capsules before 89 showing that upscaling to 10 liter stirred - tank bioreactor allows to reach unrivalled amplification factors . 90 Altogether , the C - STEM technology overcomes the scale - up bottleneck faced in cell therapy bioproduction . We 91 discuss that the origins of this performance could be related to unprecedented cell viability of 3D lumenized 92 colonies within these capsules . 93 94 RESULTS 95 High - throughput microfluidic encapsulation of hiPSCs 96 Using a microfluidic technique to generate hollow hydrogel spheres ( Fig . 1A , Movie S1 , and detailed description 97 in the Materials and Methods section ) previously developed by us and others ( 26 – 29 ) we encapsulated human 98 induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSC ) in liquid core capsules . Briefly , the working principle is the following : a 99 three - layered cylindrical flow is generated using a co - extrusion microfluidic device : the cell suspension is 100 surrounded by an alginate solution . Both solutions are separated by a sorbitol solution to prevent diffusion of 101 calcium released from the cell suspension towards the alginate solution . Upon exiting the microfluidic device at 102 high flow rate ( on the order of 120 ml / h for all three solutions ) , the liquid jet is fragmented into small droplets 103 due to the Plateau - Rayleigh instability . By contrast with the dripping regime obtained at lower flow rate that gives 104 rise to droplets of size in the order of the capillary length ( i . e . ~ mm ) , the droplet radius is here dictated by the 105 extruder’s nozzle size ( ~ 200 microns diameter ) ( 30 ) . This reduced size , which is below the distance over which 106 oxygen and nutrients supply is limited within a tissue , allows to avoid the formation of a necrotic core ( 31 ) . Once 107 they fall in a calcium bath , the alginate solution droplets undergo gelation and trap the cell suspension in their 108 interior . Our routine protocol produces capsules at a rate of about 3 kHz ( Fig . S1 ) , meaning that a 30 seconds 109 operation generates 100 , 000 capsules . Morphological analysis shows that capsules are monodisperse in size with 110 mean external radius R = 205 µm±39 µm . and that their shape is close to spherical , with a circularity parameter 111 C = 0 . 84 ± 0 . 04 ( Fig . 1B ) . 112 In order to provide a niche - like environment to hiPSCs , Matrigel , an ECM mixture , is co - injected with the cell 113 suspension ( 28 ) . Empirically , we found that a minimal volume fraction of 25 % was required to form a continuous 114 matrix layer anchored to the inner wall of the capsule , with the excess ( if any ) being found as floating gel pieces 115 inside the capsule ( 29 ) . Most of the experiments reported in these works were performed with 50 % of Matrigel in 116 volume fraction . The granularity seen in the core of the capsule ( Fig . 1E ) thus corresponds to small floating 117 aggregates of ECM . Most encapsulations reported hereafter were performed with a density of 0 . 4×10 6 cells / ml in 118 the cell / matrix suspension , unless otherwise stated , and led to a mean number of cells per capsule right after 119 encapsulation ( day 0 ) of ~ 2 . 5 ( Fig . 1C ) , meaning that ~ 10 % of the capsules are empty , consistently with a Poisson 120 distribution . After 6 to7 days of culture , practically defined as the harvest time under these seeding conditions , 3D 121 colonies of hiPSCs were observed , suggesting , not only that hiPSCs survive , but also that they could proliferate 122 ( Fig . 1D ) . Higher magnification reveals the presence of a lumen ( Fig . 1E ) . 123 124 Culture , expansion and stemness of encapsulated 3D hiPSC colonies 125 Using phase contrast imaging , we observed in more details the growth kinetics of these 3D hiPSC colonies . First , 126 hiPSCs form a small cluster ( typically during the first 24h ) before self - organizing in a cyst structure around a 127 central lumen ( Fig . 2A , Movie S2 & S3 ) . Then , the 3D hiPSC colonies grow within the capsules while keeping 128 the same spherical shape . In the early stages , the cells within the monolayer of the cyst have a cuboid cell shape of 129 about 10 µm side ( Fig . 2B left , ~ 5 days post - encapsulation ) . Before harvesting , as seen in the confocal image of a 130 representative 7 day - old hiPSC 3D colony immunostained for actin and nucleus , cells exhibit an elongated 131 morphology perpendicular to the surface of the cyst . Yet , the cyst remains monolayered suggesting a transition 132 towards a pseudostratified columnar epithelium with most nuclei being located on the basal side opposing the 133 lumen . In this stage , the cysts are characterized by a thickness of about ~ 40 µm ( Fig . 2B right ) and a radius of 134 about ~ 100 µm Fig . S2 , day 7 ) . Note that later stages are ignored . Indeed , if cells are not harvested , cysts become 135 confined by the capsules and further grow inwards leading to a progressive loss of the lumen ( Movie S4 ) and 136 eventually the appearance of “fractures” ( Fig S2 ) . 137 The maintenance of the stemness of the encapsulated 3D hiPSC colonies was then checked . The expression of key 138 self - renewal markers such as OCT4 and SOX2 was first assessed after capsule dissolution , fixation and staining . 139 The alginate shell was dissolved by adapting the protocol of ( 29 ) : we performed a short rinse of ReLeSR , which 140 serves here as a calcium chelator that gently dissolves the alginate gel . Fixation and immunostaining were carried 141 out following standard protocols ( see Materials and Methods section ) while preserving the 3D architecture . Image 142 analysis of representative confocal images of individual cysts ( Fig . 2C ( top row ) and Fig . S2 ) allows to derive that 143 the percentage of cells positive for OCT4 and SOX2 is 97 % ( Fig . 2D top row ) . To further assess the consistency 144 of stemness phenotype , we applied the approach pursued in a different context for epiblast - stage hPSCs spheroids 145 by Freedman et al . ( 32 ) . “Naked” hiPSCs cysts were dissociated and replated into 2D cultures ( Fig . 2C ) . We 146 observed that 2D colonies are readily formed and stemness markers are detected ( Fig . 2C - D , bottom row ) with a 147 percentage of OCT4 ansd SOX2 positive cells larger than 98 % . 148 Following this characterization at the scale of individual capsules , we sought to assess the potential variability 149 between capsules and between hiPSC lines . We thus dissociated the bulk suspension cultures , extended staining to 150 OCT4 , SOX2 and NANOG and performed flow cytometry ( Fig . 2E - F ) . For 4 different cell lines ( see Materials 151 and Methods section ) by pooling all experiments ( n = 42 ) of each hiPSC line , we found that the mean percentage 152 of positive cells is 93 % OCT4 , 98 % SOX2 and 92 % NANOG ( Fig . 2F ) . This finding is in good agreement with 153 the above - described findings at the single 3D colony level , suggesting an overall homogeneity of the stem cell 154 culture . 155 Note that , if capsules culture was prolonged beyond 7 days , despite drastic changes of topology from cyst to 156 aggregate ( Fig . S2 C - E and Movie S4 ) , the stemness of the hiPSCs was not affected , as revealed by OCT4 and 157 SOX2 staining before and after lumen collapse ( Fig . S2 B - C ) , suggesting that harvest timing is not critically 158 stringent with respect to the stemness maintenance . 159 160 Pluripotency and genomic integrity of encapsulated 3D hiPSC colonies 161 While OCT4 , SOX2 and NANOG are often considred as pluripotency markers , they actually are stemness 162 markers . To assess more thoroughly the pluripotency and validate the quality of hPSCs upon 3D culture in their 163 ability to differentiate as bona fide pluripotent stem cells , the most commonly used assay is the trilineage 164 differentiation assay ( 33 ) , in which stochastic differentiation is induced . Following a standard protocol ( 34 ) ( see 165 Materials and Methods section ) , decapsulated and dissociated hiPSC ( from the three available cell lines ) were 166 driven towards early differentiation , as shown by the stainings for specific markers of the 3 germ layers : namely 167 b3 - tubulin ( TUJI ) for ectoderm , smooth muscle actin ( α - SMA ) for mesoderm and a - fetoprotein ( AFP ) for 168 endoderm ( Fig . 3A ) . Even though the expression level may differ from one cell line to another , all stainings are 169 positive and clearly reveal a differenciation into the three germ layers . 170 To further quantify the differentiation potential after 3D culture within capsules , we used qPCR Scorecard TM 171 assay to evaluate the transcription profile of the cells obtained in the trilineage assay ( Fig . 3B ) . The set of 94 172 previously validated qPCR markers of self - renewal , ectoderm , mesendoderm , mesoderm and endoderm ( 35 , 36 ) 173 was used to compare standard 2D culture and 3D culture - in - capsules . Fig . 3B shows that , for a given marker and 174 a given cell line , there is a striking similarity between the transcription signatures in 2D and 3D culture 175 conditions , indicating that pluripotency assessed as the in vitro differentiation capability of hiPSC clonies is 176 definitely not altered in our encapsulated 3D colonies . A pooled analysis by germ layer ( Fig . S4 ) confirms similar 177 differentiation profile between 2D and 3D stem cells . 178 Finally , to control genomic integrity of the 3D colonies , we performed high resolution SNP ( single nucleotide 179 polymorphism ) arrays before and after amplification within the capsules ( Fig . 3C and Fig . S5 ) ( 37 ) . Comparative 180 SNP analysis showed the absence of aneuploidies , deletions or duplications , as evidenced by the superimposable 181 karyotypes . The high degree of SNP concordance ( > 99 . 8 % for all hiPSC lines ) before and after encapsulation 182 confirms cell line identity ( Fig . 3D ) . 183 184 Comparative growth of 3D hiPSC colonies at the scale of a single capsule , in a static suspension and in 185 bioreactors 186 To evaluate whether the strategy to produce 3D colonies in ECM - coated capsules impacts the growth and 187 expansion rates of hiPSC , we performed a series of sytematic experiments to probe the cell growth kinetics . The 188 standard 2D cell cultures were taken as a control . Since the amplification factor is defined as AF = N ( t 0 + Dt ) / N ( t 0 ) , 189 where N ( t 0 ) and N ( t 0 + Dt ) are the cell numbers at the initial time t 0 and t 0 + Dt respectively , direct cell counting at 190 day 6 after passaging give a mean AF 2D ( t = 6 days ) ~ 13 . Since , by definition , AF ( Dt ) = 2 Dt / PDT , with PDT the cell 191 population doubling time , by pooling amplification factors at different harvesting time , we obtain a mean 192 PDT 2D = 34h ±5 hours for iPS C line , which falls within the range of data reported in the literature ( 14 , 15 , 38 ) . 193 Then , in order to characterize the growth of individual encapsulated 3D hiPSC colonies , we cultured them in 35 194 mm petri dishes ( typically as few as 10 capsules in a volume of medium ~ 5ml , permitting to conserve the same 195 medium for the whole course of the experiment without any risk of nutrient depletion and acidification ) . We 196 performed time - lapse phase contrast imaging over a one - week period . We assume that cell volume remains 197 constant , which allows us to derive AF capsule ( Dt ) = V ( t 0 + Dt ) / V ( t 0 ) by measuring the volume of the cyst V ( t ) from 198 image analysis : ( ) 3 3 4 ( ) 3 out in V t R R π = − , where R in and R out are the average internal and external radii of the cyst 199 ( see notations on Fig . 4A ) . Figure 4B shows the evolution of AF capsule as a function of time for individual 200 encapsulated 3D colonies . One immediately observes that AF capsule ( t = 7 days ) = 212 . Additionally , since AF 201 increases exponentially as (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:3) ∆(cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:7) exp (cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:2)(cid:3) . ∆(cid:6) (cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:0)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7) (cid:6) , one finds PDT capsule = 22±1 hours . 202 With the perspective of scaling up the production of hiPSCs , we also investigated how the growth of encapsulated 203 3D hiPSC colonies was impacted when cultured in conditions of i ) static bulk suspension in standard T - Flasks 204 ( Fig . 4B ) and ii ) stirred suspension in a benchtop bioreactor ( Fig . 4C ) . STBRs are the most common bioreactors 205 used to culture biological agents for biotechnological applications . Besides ther capacity to monitor and adjust the 206 pH and oxygen partial pressure and to refresh the medium , the mechanical agitation provided by the impellers 207 allows better fluid mixing and oxygen transfer ability as compared to static suspension ( 39 ) . However , the 208 drawback may also be that the shear stess induced by the impellers was shown to cause deleterious effects such as 209 cell death or decrease in cell growth in aggregate - or microcarrier - based cultures ( 40 , 41 ) . Practically , we loaded 210 capsules from a same batch in T - flasks and in a STBR at the same initial density . The bioreactor impeller 211 rotational speed was set to 150 rpm , which is sufficient to maintain medium homogeneity and avoid capsule 212 sedimentation . We could not detect any change in the shape of the capsules and 3D colonies under these stirring 213 conditions . Then , after dissolution of the alginate shell and dissociation of the cysts , we counted the stem cells in 214 both static and stirred culture conditions to derive the amplification factors AF in time . We found AF flask ( 7 days ) = 215 109 ± 6 and AF bioreactor ( 7 days ) = 104 ± 18 ( Fig . 4D ) . From the values of the characteristic times for the 216 exponential variation of AF , we could calculate , as explained above , PDT flas k = 25± 6h and PDT STBR = 25±3 h ( Fig . 217 4E ) . Three remarks can be made . First , these PDT values are significantly lower than the ones derived from 2D 218 cultures , indicating again than the expansion is greatly improved in 3D , as evidenced by the low number of dead 219 cells in capsules ( Fig . 4F ) as compared with 2D colonies ( Fig . S6 ) . Second , the AF values are about twice as low 220 as the one derived from the masurements at the single capsule level . Third , the absence of statistical difference 221 between the two culture systems suggests that , while the impeler - induced shear stress does not affect cell 222 viability , stirred suspension culture in a benchtop bioreactor with expected better homogenization does not 223 enhance the expansion under the experimental conditions selected here . 224 Additionally , we performed flow cytometry analysis and found that more than 92 % of the cells are positive for 225 SOX2 , NANOG and OCT4 . Stemness thus remains high and similar between static and stirred cultures ( Fig . S7 ) , 226 indicating that , by contrast with previous reports ( 42 ) , shear stress does not trigger the differentiation of hiPSC 227 colonies grown in hollow capsules . Finally , in order to confirm that the amplification factors reported above are 228 not hiPSC line specific , we carried out the same series of experiments for the other 3 cell lines in static culture 229 ( Fig . 4E ) . Not only are the differences between cell lines not significant , but their PDT in 3D is also found very 230 close to the value derived for the commercial hiPSC line that we have extensively investigated in this section , i . e . 231 PDT flask = 27± 2 h by averaging over all 3 cell lines . 232 233 Optimized culture conditions : Impact of capsule size and oxygen tension 234 As shown above , the static or stirred batch cultures of hiPSC colonies in capsules yielded amplification at day 7 235 about twice as low as the one measured at the single capsule level . Although this difference only corresponds to a 236 3h difference in PDT , we sought to address this issue and find out solutions to further improve the amplification 237 of hiPSC in batch for large - scale production . We investigated the impact of two possible parameters . 238 First , we tested whether hiPSC amplification depends on the cell seeding density . The most obvious way would 239 be to increase the volume fraction of cells in the core solution loaded to the microfluidic injector . However , this 240 would lead to earlier and more frequent harvesting . Instead , we pursued a different strategy . We kept the cell 241 density constant but increased the size of the capsules by changing the size of the nozzle ( 28 ) . Doing so , for a 242 given volume of the encapsulation cell suspension , the number of produced capsules is indeed reduced by 243 ( R big / R small ) 3 but the mean number of cells per capsule , λ , is increased by the same fold . In the context of sparse 244 distribution , Poisson statistics applies and the generation of 300 µm in radius capsules instead of 200 µm leads to 245 an increase in λ by about 3 fold . The immediate consequence is that the probability to have capsules containing no 246 cell is decreased from about 8 % to negligible ( ~ 0 . 03 % ) . But , more importantly , the probability to have capsules 247 with only one cell that may die or exhibit some lag phase before proliferation goes from 20 % to 0 . 3 % . High 248 occurrence of capsules loaded with only one cell is expected to lower the effective amplification factor and thus to 249 increase the doubling time of the cell population . Fig . 5A shows representative phase contrast images of 300 µm 250 in radius capsules filled with hPSC colonies . Noteworthily , most capsules contain several cysts , suggesting that 251 cyst growth was nucleated from several cell aggregates . More quantitatively , after monitoring the growth kinetics 252 in benchtop STBR , derivation of the time constant reveals shorter doubling time in big capsules : PDT big = 22h±1h 253 < PDT small = 25h±1h ( Fig . 5B ) . 254 Second , we pursued along our physiomimetic approach . Among all factors that make a stem cell niche , we have 255 already recapitulated interactions with the ECM . However , untill now , we have omitted to consider oxygen 256 tension , which is known to be naturally low in developping embryos ( 43 ) . This low level of oxygen was further 257 shown to be key to reduce mutation rates and epigenetic alterations ( 44 , 45 ) as well as to improve the expansion 258 rate ( 46 ) while reducing the probability of unwanted differentiation ( 47 ) . We thus performed the same culture 259 experiments in big capsules ( 300 µm radius ) by decreasing the dissolved oxygen level ( DO ) from 100 % to 20 % . 260 ( see Materials and Methods section ) . Under these hypoxic conditions , the population doubling time derived from 261 the growth kinetics was found to be (cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) (cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:11)(cid:18) (cid:7) 20 . 4(cid:19) ( Fig . 5B ) , i . e , slightly but significantly shorter than in 262 normoxic conditions . Remarkably , this value is better than the one found at the single capsule level in normoxia , 263 suggesting that the optimization of capsule size and oxygen tension allowed to upscale the production of hPSCs in 264 a bench - scale bioreactor without any degradation of the expansion efficiency . 265 In order to assess whether this protocol is not only theoretically scalable but can be truly upscaled to an industrial 266 level , we carried out a final experiment in duplicate in a 10 L STBR ( Fig . 5C , S8 and Movie S5 ) by keeping all 267 other parameters constant . Figure 5D shows the the expansion - fold as a function of time . The two curves from 268 these two independent experiments are superimposable and we found AF 10L STBR ( 6 . 5 days ) = 277 , corresponding to 269 a doubling time PDT 10L STBR = 19 . 6 h . 270 These data were obtained without passaging . In order to assess the robustness of the approach for a seed train of 271 passaging and demonstrate that the technology can be integrated into a classical cell therapy production , we 272 performed serial passaging . At harvest after about 7 days , the capsules were dissolved , the 3D colonies were 273 dissociated and cells re - encapsulated following the same protocol ( Fig . 6 ) . We found that expansion - fold and 274 stemness were preserved over two consecutive encapsulations within 14 days ( Fig . S9 ) . 275 276 DISCUSSION 277 In this work , we have developed an in vitro culture system for hiPSCs , that we named C - STEM ( Fig . 6 ) and 278 combines the benefits of biomimetic 3D culture and scalable bioreactor - based production . By contrast with other 279 approaches using scaffold embedding in bulk matrix ( 48 ) or hydrogel beads ( 49 , 50 ) , our hollow capsules allow 280 in - situ engineering of stem cell niche - like microenvironment . With biological and topological cues driving 3D 281 self - organization of hiPSCs colonies that are reminiscent of epiblasts ( 51 ) . While cell - cell interactions are not 282 impaired due to the absence of enwrapping scaffold , the presence of the shell also provides mechanical protection 283 against impeller damage and turbulence - induced so - called Kolmogorov eddies during stirring ( 52 ) . Besides 284 exploiting both the biomimetic and protective properties of the developed C - STEM platform , we have finally 285 refined the culture conditions by optimizing the initial mean number of cells per capsule and the oxygen tension . 286 Combination of all these critical factors allowed us to upscale the production of hPSCs and demonstrate that the 287 amplification efficiency is scale - independent . In particular , we could reach 282 - fold amplification in 6 . 5 days in a 288 10 L stirred - tank bioreactor . 289 To the best of our knowledge , this level of both amplification and scalability is unmatched in the field ( 15 , 53 ) . 290 This technical and quantitative tour de force is actually related to the higher cell viability obtained in our hollow 291 capsules as compared with 2D cultures or other 3D suspension cultures . Since the amplification factor AF ( t ) of a 292 culture system is given by (cid:0)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:6) (cid:7) 2 (cid:6) / (cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) , where PDT is the population doubling time and accounts both for cell 293 division and cell death , we may rewrite it as (cid:0)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:6) (cid:7) 2 (cid:20)(cid:21) (cid:8) (cid:22)(cid:21) (cid:9) (cid:23)(cid:6) , where k + and k - are respectively the division and 294 death rate of cells . Thus , the upper theoretical limit for AF is obtained for k - = 0 ( i . e . infinite death time ) , which 295 then yields a minimal PDT min value , equal to k + . Quite surprisingly , the measurement of k + or the duration of the 296 cell cycle t + = 1 / k + of hiPSC has been overlooked in the literature . The sole report we are aware of arises from a 297 recent work in which cell cycle kinetics was tracked using a rainbow reporter in primed pluripotent stem cells 298 ( 54 ) . The obtained cell cycle duration was found to be t + ~ 14 h . While the question of “gemellarity” between 299 embryonic stem cells ( ESC ) and hiPSC is still under debate ( 55 ) , this value is also consistent with previous 300 estimates of t + = 11 – 16 - h for the cell cycle duration in human and mammalian ESC ( 56 – 58 ) . By assuming that the 301 duration of the cell cycle in the 3D cyst topology is identical to the value obtained in 2D cultures with AF ( t = 6 . 5 302 days ) = 282 corresponding to PDT = 19h , we find that the doubling time of the encapsulated hiPSC colonies is only 303 5h±2h longer than the intrinsic cell cycle duration . The difference corresponds to a death rate k - = 1 / 53h - 1 . By 304 comparison , in the seminal Yamanaka’s paper ( 14 ) , doubling times in 2D hiPSC colonies of about 45 h indicate 305 that k - = 1 / 20h - 1 . More meaningful than the death rate k - , the fraction of dead cells can be roughly estimated as 306 (cid:20) (cid:24)(cid:25)(cid:18)(cid:24) (cid:21) (cid:3) (cid:10)(cid:9)(cid:11) (cid:3) (cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14) = 2 . 6 % at t = 6 . 5 days , while cell counting gives 1 . 30 % in bioreactors and 1 . 97 % in flasks ( Fig . S6 ) . In 307 2D cultures , we measured a fraction of dead cells of the order of 12 % at harvest , even though this value under - 308 estimates the cumulated mortality which is drastically impacted by cell passaging and confluency ( 59 ) . Further 309 expansion improvement is theoretically within reach by vanishing the cell death rate . Taking again t + ~ 14 h for the 310 cell cycle length of hiPSC , the glass ceiling is calculated to be AF max ( t = 6 . 5 d ) ~ 2200 . However , the value of t + ~ 14 311 h cannot be taken as granted . For instance , a cell density - dependence on the proliferation rate has been reported . 312 Indeed , hPSC exhibit a decelerated proliferation due to a prolonged G1 phase as cell density increases ( 60 ) . 313 Similarly , smaller expansion folds were observed when the inoculation density either as single cells or pre - 314 clusters in a synthetic hydrogel exceeds 10 6 cells / mL ( 48 ) . We may then anticipate that the actual average cell 315 cycle duration could be longer than the one reported above upon single - cell lineage tracking in small colonies of 316 hPSCs . As a consequence , even though future work should aim at a rigorous in situ measurement of the division 317 rate within the encapsulated hiPSC cysts , we cannot exclude that the unprecedented hiPSC expansion rates 318 reported in this work are approaching the glass ceiling . 319 Among other specificities of the C - STEM technology , we mentioned the protective role of the alginate shell and 320 the scale - independence of the culture conditions . By contrast with other suspension cultures that need to design 321 specific low - shear impellers ( e . g . the vertical - wheel bioreactor , ( 61 , 62 ) , or to add shear - dampener polymers ( e . g . 322 pluronics , ( 24 ) ) in order to avoid stirring - induced cell damages , our capsules permit the use of standard industrial 323 scale bioreactors . 324 However , all the benefits cannot be assigned to this sole shielding effect . Indeed , previous works had already 325 proposed to embed either hESC aggregates or microcarriers within hydrogel beads ( which are referred to as 326 capsules in these original works ) ( 50 ) to improve cell viability . Nonetheless , expansion rates were not reported to 327 be larger than 10 in 19 days . Similarly , two recent works describe stem cells encapsulation in hollow capsules ( 63 , 328 64 ) . However , the absence of ECM leads to the formation of aggregates and a modest amplification ( estimated to 329 70 - fold in 8 days from the size of the encapsulated spheroids ) . We thus propose that the significant amplification 330 increase obtained with the C - STEM technology mostly originates from the stem cell niche - like environment that 331 is engineered within each capsule and that drives hiPSC multicellular organization into cysts . 332 Interestingly , numerous studies have recently proposed biomimetic controllable environments that can be used to 333 develop hPSC - based embryo models and more specifically epiblast models ( 22 , 65 , 66 ) . In all cases , these 3D 334 stem cell niche mimics drive PSCs self - organization , luminogenesis , and polarization into pseudo - stratified 335 epithelia ( 19 – 21 ) . This cyst configuration , which seems to be key in developmental processes , may be regarded as 336 an optimized configuration for hPSC expansion with minimal loss of viability ( 67 ) . First , it is well accepted that 337 2D hiPSC cultures exhibit intra - colony heterogeneities in pluripotency marker genes ( 68 ) , viability ( 69 ) and cell 338 morphology ( 70 ) , which are very striking between the center and the edges of the colonies . In this respect , the 339 closed spherical symmetry of a cyst intrinsically suppresses the “center - edge phenotype” and may result in more 340 homogeneous cell population ( 71 ) . Additionally , whereas cellular crowding or compaction are known to inhibit 341 proliferation or even trigger apoptosis via caspase - dependent mechanisms ( 72 ) a cyst configuration is less prone 342 to stress building in bulk due to the presence of a lumen . Similarly , fast proliferation rate may contribute to stress 343 relaxation and reduce cell extrusion occurrence as observed in epithelia under compression ( 73 , 74 ) . Besides 344 mechanical stress , chemical stresses are known to increase the mutation rate ( 44 , 75 ) . The use of bioreactors with 345 precise adjustment of physioxia , pH , lactate , glucose and nutriments supply is thus instrumental and could be 346 optimized beyond the present achievement . 347 Finally , relying on the observation that chromosome segregation fidelity is unambiguously higher in native 348 contexts of epithelia of primary cells ( 76 , 77 ) , it also becomes tempting to speculate that , beyond the gain in 349 amplification it provides , the preserved histology of our in - vitro epiblast - like colonies could also be beneficial to 350 the maintenance of the genetic integrity ( 78 ) . 351 352 In summary , our work has shown that hollow alginate capsules with reconstituted niche - like microenvironement 353 can promote the formation and growth of 3D hPSC colonies and provide the necessary protection for scaling up 354 the production in stirred tank bioreactors . Self - organized encapsulated epiblast - like colonies seem to be 355 instrumental for optimal expansion by preserving stem cells physiological properties . We have demonstrated that 356 our biomimetic stem cell platform C - STEM can deliver unprecedented scalability and we anticipate that cell 357 quality is preserved on the basis of extremely high viability , which is taken as a primary signature of cell fitness . 358 Future works should focus on assessing the hPSCs quality in in vivo - like culture systems , since the emergence of 359 mutations during culture may be the last limitation to overcome for cell therapy bioproduction . 360 MATERIALS AND METHODS 361 Ethics statements 362 The generation , use and storage of hiPSCs were performed with approval from the “Comité de Protection des 363 Personnes” ( CPP ) Ile de France ( DC 2015 - 2595 and 2016 - A00773 - 48 ) . 364 Human pluripotent stem cell lines 365 Throughout the present work , we used 4 hiPSC lines . Among these , 3 hiPS cells , namely IMAGINi004 - A 366 ( referred to as iPS004 ) , IMAGINi005 - A ( iPS005 ) and IMAGINi013 - A ( iPS013 ) were derived from peripheral 367 blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) according to the protocol described in ( 34 ) . Briefly , PBMCs were transduced 368 using the CytoTune - iPS 2 . 0 Sendai Reprogramming Kit ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) following the manufacturer ' s 369 instructions . After 2 - 3 weeks , colonies were manually picked and expanded at least 10 passages . The 4 th hiPSC 370 line is a commercial line from ThermoFisher : Gibco TM episomal hiPSC line ( A18945 ) generated using cord blood 371 derived CD34 + progenitors with 7 episomally expressed factors ( Oct4 , Sox2 , Klf4 , Myc , Nanog , Lin28 , and 372 SV40 T ) . This commercial cell line is referred to as iPS C . For the sake of availability , in order to allow other 373 groups to reproduce our findings , all experiments reported here were performed with iPS C , except for those that 374 are described in Figures 2F , 3A , B , D 4E and Figures S4 S5 , which were carried out to demonstrate that the 375 findings were not cell line - dependent . 376 2D hiPSC culture 377 All hiPSC lines were maintained on Matrigel ( Corning Ref . 354234 ) and cultured in mTeSR1 medium ( StemCell 378 Technologies 85875 ) . Cultures were fed daily , passaged with an enzyme - free reagent , ReleSR ( StemCell 379 Technologies 05873 ) every 3 - 6 days ( around 80 % confluency ) and replated as small clusters ( between 100 and 380 200 µm ) at a density of about 5000 - 10000 cells / cm 2 . Cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere 381 containing 5 % CO2 . 382 3D hiPSC Encapsulation 383 Prior to encapsulation , 2D stem cell colonies were detached using ReLeSR for 1 minute and dissociated into a 384 near single cell solution using Accutase ( Stem Cell Thechnologies 07920 ) . HiPSCs were then mixed in a 50 / 50 385 volume ratio with Matrigel at 4°C to keep the suspension in a liquid state . The final concentration of cells in the 386 cell / matrix solution was thus between 0 . 4 - 1 . 0×10 6 viable cells / mL , referred to as the encapsulation density . The 387 encapsulation system is similar to the one described in ( 29 ) . In brief , ethylene tetrafluoroethylene ( ETFE , ) tubings 388 are connected to the three inlets of a 3D printed ( using the DLP Micro Plus Hi - Res printer from EnvisionTEC ) 389 microfluidic co - laminar flow device . An extruded and polished glass microcapillary tip ( of diameter ~ 100 µm for 390 most experiments reported in this work , at the exception of those shown in Fig . 5A - B that were carried out with a 391 nozzle diameter of 150 µm ) is glued to the outlet of the nozzle for a better control of the flow . The cell / matrix 392 suspension is loaded into the inner channel of the 3 - way device , which is kept refrigerated thanks to an in - line 393 cooling system in order to prevent premature gelation of Matrigel . A solution of sodium alginate ( Novamatrix 394 Pronova SLG100 , 0 , 25 g # 4202101 at 2 % in distilled water ) is injected into the outer channel . To prevent alginate 395 gelation within the microfluidic device due to calcium release from the suspended cells , a calcium - free solution 396 ( Sorbitol 300mM , Sigma - Aldrich 85529 ) is used in the intermediate channel of the co - extrusion chip and serves 397 as a barrier against calcium diffusion . Typical flow rates for the 3 solutions were on the order of 120 ml / h for all 398 three channels : ( alginate solution , the sorbitol solution and the cell + matrix suspension ) . At these rates , the 399 composite solution forms a liquid jet that fragments into droplets ( of about twice the size of the nozzle ) due to the 400 spontaneous Rayleigh - Plateau instability . To avoid subsequent coalescence of the train of droplet , an alginate 401 charging part and a copper ring are connected to a high voltage ( 2000V ) generator are introduced . A high - speed 402 camera ( PHANTOM VEO 1310L ) was used to visualize droplet formation and splay ( Fig . S1and Movie S1 ) . 403 When the composite droplets contact the collecting calcium bath ( at 100mM ) , the outer layer of alginate readily 404 gelates . As a consequence , the inner cell / matrix solution remains entrapped inside a closed , spherical and 405 permeable micro - compartment . Within 1 min following encapsulation , capsules are rinsed with medium ( DMEM ) 406 to reduce the basal calcium concentration . Finally , ther are transferred to suspension culture medium . 407 Re - encapsulation was performed by dissolution of alginate shells using short rReleSR rinse , followed by cell 408 dissociation using TrypLE ( Trypsin - based , dissociation enzyme , ThermoFischer ) for 20 minutes at 37° . Then the 409 obtained cells were processed following the classic encapsulation protocol . 410 3D stem cell suspension culture in static T - Flasks or bioreactors 411 Static suspension cultures of encapsulated hiPSC were carried out using T - Flasks ( from 5 to 30 ml ) maintained in 412 a cell culture incubator at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . The medium ( mTeSR1 ) was supplemented with 10µM Y - 27632 for 413 ROCK inhibition only during the first 24 hours of culture . From culture day 3 , the medium was exchanged every 414 day as described hereafter . The contents of the T - Flasks were transferred into Falcon Tubes . After capsules 415 sedimentation ( within a few minutes ) , the supernatant was removed and replenished as the capsules were 416 transferred back into a T - Flasks . The volume of culture medium was kept constant for the first 4 days of culture 417 ( ~ 4× the capsules volume ) . Then , the volume was steadily increased every day in order to maintain a cell 418 concentration bellow 10 6 cells / mL . 419 Stirred suspension cultures were performed in different bioreactors . For all experiments reported in Fig . 4 and Fig . 420 5A - B , we used benchtop STBRs , including a 30 mL ( Minibio , ABLE® Bioreactor Systems ) or 500 mL 421 bioreactors ( Applikon Biotechnology & Global Process Concept ) . For the experiments reported in Fig . 5C - D , we 422 used a 10 liter - scale bioreactor ( Global Process Concept ) . 423 In all cases , the bioreactors were inoculated with 15 % capsule - to - medium volume . The bioreactor culture starts at 424 a volume representing 30 % of the final working volume . At Day1 , the medium was replaced with fresh medium 425 without ROCK inhibitor . From day 2 to 5 , the culture is performed in a fed - batch mode up to the final working 426 volume ( 39 ) . Then , we switched to repeated - batch mode , where 90 % of the media was daily renewed to maintain 427 sufficient nutriment supply . The final capsule - to - medium volume was 4 . 2 ± 0 . 3 % and the pH was maintained at 428 7 . 2 ±0 . 2 . 429 Dissolved Oxygen ( DO ) level is calibrated at 100 % in starting conditions by injecting air into the bioreactor 430 headspace . During the run , the oxygen level is monitored and controlled . In normoxic conditions the oxygen is 431 controlled at 100 % while in hypoxic conditions the set point is at 20 % DO . Oxygen level is regulated by sparging 432 nitrogen and / or air to maintain the set point . 10L scale bioreactors were regulated in hypoxic conditions . During 433 one week of culture , the stirring speed is set at 150 rpm that is sufficient to keep capsules resuspension and 434 bioreactor homogeneity along the run . 435 Time - lapse microscopy of encapsulated cyst growth and image analysis 436 Time - lapse microscopy was performed using a Nikon Biostation IM microscope with a 10x objective . Capsules 437 containing hiPSCs were transferred to a 35 mm Petri dish 24 hours after encapsulation . Approximately 10 to 20 438 capsules were placed in the petri dish containing 5 mL of fresh Y - 27632 - free mTeSR1 medium . Cyst growth was 439 monitored over 7 days . Practically , images were taken every 6 to 10 minutes at preselected Z - focal planes to 440 ensure acquisition at proper focus in case of undesired drift Image analysis was performed using ImageJ . The 441 external and internal effective radii of the cysts , R out and R in , were measured from the equatorial corresponding 442 cross sections S according to R out , in = ( S out , in / π ) 1 / 2 after applying appropriate bandpass filters and thresholds . The 443 volume V of the cells was calculated as V = 4 π / 3 ( R out3 - R in3 ) . Capsule circularity was defined as C = a 2 / b 2 , where a 444 and b are the short and long axes of the approximated ellipse . 445 In vitro trilineage differentiation 446 Small cell clusters were collected from hiPSC cultures ( 2D or decapsulated - dissociated 3D hiPSCs colonies ) and 447 transferred into low attachment dishes ( Corning , Ultra - low attachment 6 well plate ) . Three - dimensional 448 aggregates of cells that are an amalgam of the three developmental germ layers ( Embryoid bodies ) are obtained 449 and cultured in suspension for 7 to 9 days with DMEM / F - 12 medium containing 20 % pluriQ Serum Replacement 450 ( GlobalStem ) , 1 % non - essential amino acids , 1 % penicillin - streptomycin and 0 . 2 % β - mercaptoethanol 451 ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO2 . Culture medium was refreshed every 452 two days . EBs were then collected for RNA analyses or transferred onto gelatin - coated dishes for 1 week . For 453 immunocytochemistry analysis , cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature ( RT ) . 454 After washing in PBS / 1 % BSA blocking solution for 1 hour , cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary 455 antibodies , washed 3 times in PBS , and incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 hours at RT . Antibodies were 456 diluted in PBS / 1 % BSA / 0 . 1 % triton solution . The list of antibodies used in this work and their origin are listed in 457 Table S1 . Nuclei were stained with a DAPI solution . Immuno - fluorescence staining was analyzed using the 458 Celena S™ Digital Imaging System ( Logos Biosystems ) . 459 RNA extraction and RT - PCR analyses 460 Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) . cDNA was synthesized using a high capacity 461 cDNA RT kit ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) from 1 μ g of total RNA . The expression of pluripotency markers as well 462 as the trilineage differentiation potential of the cells were evaluated by TaqMan® hiPSC Scorecard™ assay 463 according to the manufacturer ' s protocol . This scorecard compares the gene expression pattern of key 464 pluripotency and germ lineage markers relative to a reference standard that consists of 9 different human ES and 465 iPS lines . Data analysis was performed using the cloud based TaqMan® hiPSC Scorecard TM analysis software . 466 DNA isolation , genomic stability and authenticity analysis 467 DNA isolation was performed using the PureLink™ Genomic DNA Mini Kit ( Invitrogen ) . Molecular karyotype 468 was performed using an Infinium Core - 24 v1 . 2 Kit ( Illumina ) containing 300000 SNPs . Data were analyzed with 469 BeadStudio / GenomeStudio software ( Illumina ) . The percentage of SNP concordance between iPSC samples 470 before and 7 days after encapsulation was assessed for the 3 derived iPS cell lines . SNP files of all samples were 471 extracted from genome studio software . The percentage of concordance between two paired samples ( before and 472 after encapsulation ) was evaluated by comparing the genotype of each informative SNP ( Fig . S5 ) 473 Flow cytometry analysis 474 The hiPSCs colonies were dissociated with Accutase for 10 minutes at 37°C for 2D cultures or with TrypLE 475 Select ( ThermoFisher Scientific 11598846 ) for 30 minutes at 37°C for 3D cultures after capsule removal . Then , 476 cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set ( ThermoFisher 11500597 ) . 477 Cells were suspended in the permeabilization buffer at a density of 0 . 5 - 1×10 6 cells in 100 μ l and incubated with 478 the specific antibodies or isotype controls ( Table S1 ) for 45 minutes at room temperature in the dark . Cells were 479 washed twice with the staining buffer and analyzed using either BD Canto II ( at the TBMCore CNRS UMS 3427 480 – INSERM US 005 ) or a BD Accuri TM C6 plus and data was post - processed with FlowJo software . 481 Cell growth and viability analysis 482 Cell counting was performed using the Nucleo counter NC3000 or NC200 ( Chemometec ) . Live / dead analysis was 483 performed using CalceinAM / Ethidium homodimer - 1 ( ThermoFisher L3224 ) according to the manufacturer 484 recommendations , and samples were imaged using either the EVOS FL or EVOS M5000 auto Imaging system 485 ( ThermoFischer ) . 486 Immunostaining , Microscopy , and Image Analysis 487 For daily brightfield imaging of 2D cultures and encapsulated hiPSC cysts , a widefield EVOS FL or EVOS 488 M5000 automated microscope was used . Encapsulated 3D hiPSC colonies were harvested for confocal 489 microscopy at several timepoints . The alginate capsule was removed prior to fixation by incubating the samples in 490 PBS without divalent cations for at least 5 minutes with agitation at RT . Both 2D and 3D stem cell colonies were 491 fixed with 4 % PFA for 30 - 60 minutes at RT in the dark . Following fixation , the samples were washed 3x with 492 0 . 1 % Tween20 in PBS . A permeabilization step was done in parallel with excess PFA quenching in a PBS 493 solution containing 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 and 100 mM Glycine for 30 minutes , followed by 3x washing with 0 . 1 % 494 Tween20 in PBS . The samples were incubated in primary and secondary antibodies ( Table S1 ) in 1 % BSA + 495 0 . 1 % Tween20 in PBS overnight at 4° with gentle orbital agitation , including a 3x rinsing with 1 % BSA + 0 . 1 % 496 Tween20 in PBS after each incubation . To maintain alginate capsules during fixation and staining , the 497 decapsulation step was skipped and all solutions ( including 4 % PFA ) were supplemented with calcium and 498 magnesium . All samples were imaged on either a Leica SP5 or SP8 confocal microscope ( Bordeaux Imaging 499 Center , BIC ) . 500 Statistical Analysis 501 All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism8 . To test significant differences between bioreactor 502 and flask , 2wayANOVA with sidak’s multiple comparaison test was used . To compare between 2 groups , a 503 student T - test was used . All statistical significance is reported in terms of p - values < 0 . 05 . 504 REFERENCES 505 506 1 . O . Lindvall , S . Rehncrona , P . Brundin , B . Gustavii , B . Åstedt , H . Widner , T .
