We found that the high sensitivity of HEp - 2 cells to VacA was impaired by treating the cells with phosphatidylino - sitol - speciﬁc phospholipase C ( PI - PLC ) which removes glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - an - chored proteins from the cell surface . Incubation of cells with a cholesterol - sequestering agent , that impairs both structure and function of sphingolipid - cholesterol - rich membrane microdo - mains ( “lipid rafts” ) , also impaired VacA - induced cell vacuolation . Overexpression into HEp - 2 cells of proteins inhibiting clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( i . e . , a dominant - negative mutant of Eps15 , the ﬁve tandem Src - homology - 3 domains of intersectin , and the K44A dominant - negative mutant of dynamin II ) did not affect vacuolation induced by VacA . Nevertheless , F - actin depo - lymerization , known to block the different types of endocytic mechanisms , strongly impaired VacA vacuolating activity . Taken together , our data suggest that the high cell sensitivity to VacA depends on the presence of one or several GPI - anchored protein ( s ) , intact membrane lipid rafts , and an uptake mechanism via a clathrin - independent endocytic pathway . INTRODUCTION Helicobacter pylori is a microaerophilic , spiral - shaped , Gram - negative bacterium that colonizes the gastric mucosa of ; 50 to 60 % of the world’s population ( Taylor and Blaser , 1991 ; Blaser , 1992 ; Cave , 1997 ; Goodwin et al . , 1997 ) . It is now recognized that H . pylori plays a major role in the develop - ment of chronic gastritis , peptic ulcer , and gastric cancer ( Nomura et al . , 1991 ; Parsonnet et al . , 1991 ; NIH , 1994 ; WHO , 1994 ; Zarrilli et al . , 1999 ) . This bacterium has developed properties that allow its survival and growth in a hostile environment like the human stomach where it causes an inﬂammatory reaction and epithelial damage with cellular swelling , cytoplasmic vacuolation , and expansion of endo - somal compartments ( Tricottet et al . , 1986 ; Fiocca et al . , 1994 ; Ernst et al . , 1997 ) . Bacterial extracts from H . pylori induce cytoplasmic vacuolar degeneration in cultured cells ( Leunk et al . , 1988 ; Cover et al . , 1991 , 1992 ; Ricci et al . , 1993 ; Papini et al . , 1993 ) . A pivotal role in cell damage induced by H . pylori seems to be played by the vacuolating toxin ( VacA ) which is produced in an active form by ; 50 % of H . pylori clinical isolates ( Telford et al . , 1994b ; Ghiara et al . , 1995 ; Cover , 1996 ; Atherton , 1997 ) . VacA ( thus far the only protein toxin known to be produced by H . pylori ) causes vacuolation in a variety of cultured cell lines , although sensitivity to VacA greatly differs among the different cell types tested ( Leunk et al . , 1988 ; de Bernard et al . , 1998 ; Massari et al . , 1998 ) . When given to mice , VacA causes gastric epithelial damage closely resembling that found in H . pylori - colonized patients ( Tel - ford et al . , 1994b ) . The structure of the vacA gene varies , especially in the region encoding the signal sequence ( which may be type s1a , s1b , or s2 ) and in the midregion ( which may be type m1 or m2 ) ( Atherton et al . , 1995 ) . VacA is synthesized by H . pylori as a 140 - kDa protoxin ( Telford et al . , 1994b ; Cover , 1996 ) , which is processed to a 90 - kDa protein ‡ Corresponding author .

VacA monomers may be further processed to produce a 34 - to 37 - kDa N - terminal fragment and a 58 - kDa C - terminal fragment , these frag - ments remaining associated after cleavage ( Telford et al . , 1994a , b ; Cover , 1996 ) . Puriﬁed toxin forms high molecular mass ( ; 1 , 000 kDa ) oligomers ( Cover and Blaser , 1992 ; Cover , 1996 ) which require to be disassembled in monomers by acid or alkaline treatment to become active ( Cover et al . , 1997 , Montecucco et al . , 1999 , Yahiro et al . , 1999 ) . Neverthe - less , the ﬁndings that both bacterium - associated toxin and bacterial broth culture ﬁltrates are constitutively very active without requiring acid / alkaline pretreatment ( Leunk et al . , 1988 ; Cover et al . , 1991 , 1992 ; Ricci et al . , 1993 ; Pelicic et al . , 1999 ) suggest that VacA may be present in the extracellular microenvironment of human gastric epithelium in vivo in its active monomeric form . VacA has been reported to bind to speciﬁc , high - afﬁnity cell surface receptors ( Yahiro et al . , 1997 , 1999 ; Massari et al . , 1998 ; Seto et al . , 1998 ) and to be internalized by cells via a temperature - dependent process ( Garner and Cover , 1996 ) . After internalization , VacA local - izes in the endocytic - endosomal compartment from which vacuoles originate ( Ricci et al . , 1993 , 1997 ) . Vacuole develop - ment is strictly dependent on the presence in the incubation medium of weak bases like ammonia ( which can be gener - ated by H . pylori urease ) ( Cover et al . , 1992 ; Ricci et al . , 1997 ) . The ﬁnding of VacA in both endosomal tubulovesicles and vacuoles ( Ricci et al . , 1997 ; Sommi et al . , 1998 ) further sup - ports the hypothesis that the origin of vacuoles is endoso - mal . By using a panel of markers for varying intracellular compartments , Montecucco and coworkers ( Papini et al . , 1994 ; Molinari et al . , 1997 ) demonstrated that vacuoles orig - inate from late endosomal compartments and proposed that VacA induces the accumulation of a hybrid compartment resembling both late endosomes and lysosomes , but with a reduced proteolytic activity . Nevertheless , it has been sug - gested that VacA could cross the plasma membrane , directly penetrating the cytosol where it might exert its vacuolating action ( Molinari et al . , 1998 ) . Recently , it has been reported that VacA may act as a channel - forming toxin ( Czajkowsky et al . , 1999 ; Szabo et al . , 1999 ; Tombola et al . , 1999 ) , and that the formation of VacA membrane channels may involve oligomerization of membrane - bound monomers ( Vinion - Dubiel et al . , 1999 ) . It has also been proposed that VacA channels play a direct role in cell vacuolation : endocytosed VacA channels could stimulate the turnover of endosomal V - ATPase by increasing the permeability of the endosomal membrane to anions ( Szabo et al . , 1999 ) . This would lead to the accumulation of osmotically active species causing an osmotic imbalance of late endosomes with subsequent vac - uole formation . While an intracellular site of VacA action in causing cell vacuolation is widely accepted ( Cover , 1998 ; Montecucco et al . , 1999 ; Szabo et al . , 1999 ; McClain et al . , 2000 ) , neither the reason for the different sensitivity of cell lines to VacA nor the molecular mechanisms of VacA binding , internalization , and intracellular trafﬁcking have been clariﬁed . The present study was designed to investigate , by using different cell lines , the mechanisms of VacA binding and internalization required to enable this toxin to cause vacuo - lation in cultured cells . We found that 1 ) the high sensitivity of HEp - 2 cells to low doses of VacA is impaired by a cell treatment with phosphatidylinositol - speciﬁc phospholipase C ( PI - PLC ) , 2 ) VacA vacuolating activity can be abolished by the cholesterol - sequestering drug nystatin , and 3 ) VacA in - ternalization occurs via a clathrin - independent endocytic pathway which is sensitive to the microﬁlament - disrupting agent cytochalasin D ( CD ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Lines HEp - 2 ( from a human larynx carcinoma ) and HeLa ( from a human cervix carcinoma ) cells were cultured in DMEM ( Bio - Withaker , Verviers , Belgium ) supplemented with 7 % fetal calf serum ( FCS , from Bio - Media , Boussens , France ) and 2 mM L - glutamine ( Life Technologies , Paisley , UK ) . BHK 21 cells ( from canine kidney tubu - lar epithelium ) were grown in Glasgow minimal essential medium ( Sigma Chemical , St . Louis , MO ) supplemented with 5 % FCS and 2 mM L - glutamine ( Abrami et al . , 1998 ) . CHO ( from Chinese hamster ovary ) and MKN 28 ( from a human gastric adenocarcinoma ) cells were cultured in DMEM - F12 ( 1 : 1 ) ( Life Technologies ) with 10 % FCS and 2 mM L - glutamine . All the cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 in air and used at 30 % to 40 % conﬂuency except for 125 I - VacA binding experiments where we used conﬂuent monolayers . Bacterial Strains Two well - characterized VacA - producing H . pylori strains ( both with a type s1a / m1 vacA genotype ) were used : CCUG 17874 ( from Cul - ture Collection University of Go¨teborg , Go¨teborg , Sweden ) and 60190 ( ATCC 49503 ) . Broth Culture Filtrate Production VacA 1 broth culture ﬁltrate ( BCF ) was produced as described by Ricci et al . ( 1996 , 1997 ) . Brieﬂy , bacteria were grown in Brucella broth ( Difco , Detroit , MI ) supplemented with 1 % Vitox ( Oxoid , Basing - stoke , UK ) and 5 % FCS ( Life Technologies ) for 24 to 36 h at 37°C under microaerophilic conditions and continuous shaking . When bacterial suspensions reached 1 . 2 optical density units at 450 nm ( corresponding to a bacterial concentration of 5 3 10 8 CFU / ml ) , bacteria were removed by centrifugation ( 12 , 000 g for 10 min ) and the supernatant sterilized by passage through a 0 . 22 m m cellulose acetate ﬁlter . BCF was then concentrated 50 - fold by using centrifu - gal ﬁlter devices ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) . Concentrated VacA 1 BCF was stored at 2 20°C and used for cell intoxication . VacA prepared by this procedure does not require activation by acid / alkaline treatment . VacA Puriﬁcation , Iodination , and Activation Puriﬁed VacA , obtained from cultures of H . pylori strain 60190 ( Cover et al . , 1997 ) , was kindly provided by T . L . Cover , Nashville , TN . Puriﬁed VacA was labeled with 125 I using the Iodo - Beads iodination reagent ( Pierce Chemical Co . , Rockford , IL ) for 1 min at 4°C . The radiolabeled toxin was separated from free iodine by gel ﬁltration on a PD10 - G25 column ( Pharmacia Biotech , Uppsala , Swe - den ) . Immediately before use , puriﬁed VacA ( iodinated or not ) was activated by dropwise acidiﬁcation to pH 3 . 0 with 0 . 2 N HCl . Each preparation of 125 I - VacA was tested for vacuolating activity on HEp - 2 cells . No decrease in VacA vacuolating activity was found after iodination . Binding Assay Binding assay was performed in duplicate on 12 - well microplates at 4°C on conﬂuent HEp - 2 ( 1 . 2 3 10 6 cells / well ) or CHO ( 1 . 6 3 10 6 cells / well ) cell monolayers in Hanks’ balanced salt solution ( HBSS ) V . Ricci et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3898 in accordance with Moya et al . ( 1985 ) . Displacement of cell - associ - ated radioactivity was performed by addition ( 30 min before 125 I - VacA ) of one or other of a 50 - fold excess of nonradioactive VacA , several unrelated proteins ( ﬁnal concentration , 8 m g / ml ) , and 7 % FCS . Cell sensitivity to VacA To test the sensitivity to VacA , cells were washed twice with HBSS and then treated as follows : 1 ) for 1 h at 4°C with either VacA 1 BCF ( at dilution 1 : 100 ) or puriﬁed VacA ( ﬁnal concentration , 0 . 6 m g / ml ) in HBSS and , after a triple rinsing with ice - cold HBSS , incubated for 5 h or 16 h at 37°C in HBSS containing 5 mM NH 4 Cl ; or 2 ) incubated for 5 h or 16 h at 37°C in HBSS containing 5 mM NH 4 Cl plus either VacA 1 BCF ( at dilution 1 : 100 ) or puriﬁed VacA ( ﬁnal concentration , 0 . 6 m g / ml ) . Cell vacuolation was quantitated by means of neutral red uptake . PI - PLC Treatment PI - PLC ( from Sigma ) treatment was performed in accordance with Abrami et al . ( 1998 ) . Brieﬂy , HEp - 2 cells were incubated with HBSS containing 10 m g / ml cycloheximide ( C - HBSS ) and 5 U / ml PI - PLC for 1 h at 37°C . After extensive washing with C - HBSS , cells were incubated with VacA 1 BCF ( at dilution 1 : 300 ) or puriﬁed VacA ( ﬁnal concentration , 0 . 2 m g / ml ) in C - HBSS for 10 min at 37°C . After triple rinsing , cells were incubated in HBSS containing 5 mM NH 4 Cl for 3 h at 37°C to allow development of vacuoles . To verify the effect of PI - PLC treatment on cells previously loaded with VacA , cells were incubated with VacA 1 BCF or puriﬁed VacA as above , main - tained in HBSS for 2 h at 37°C , then treated with PI - PLC and incubated for 3 h at 37°C with HBSS containing 5 mM NH 4 Cl . Cell vacuolation was then quantitated by means of neutral red uptake , while paired monolayers were processed for electron microscopy ( see below ) . The efﬁciency of PI - PLC treatment on HEp - 2 cells was monitored by measuring the release of alkaline phosphatase in the cell medium at the end of PI - PLC digestion step in accordance with Murer et al . ( 1976 ) . Nystatin and CD Treatments To test the effect of nystatin treatment , cells were preincubated for 1 h with 25 m g / ml nystatin ( Sigma ) dissolved in DMSO or with DMSO alone ( at dilution 1 : 1000 ) , then VacA 1 BCF ( at dilution 1 : 300 ) was added and cells were incubated for 10 min at 37°C . After triple rinsing with HBSS containing nystatin or DMSO , cells were incu - bated for 5 h at 37°C in HBSS / NH 4 Cl containing nystatin or DMSO . To verify the effect of nystatin on cells previously loaded with VacA , cells were intoxicated as above , maintained in HBSS for 2 h at 37°C , and then incubated for 5 h at 37°C with nystatin or DMSO in HBSS / NH 4 Cl . To test the effect of CD treatment , HEp - 2 cells were preincubated for 2 h at 37°C with 0 . 5 m g / ml CD ( Sigma ) dissolved in DMSO or with DMSO alone ( at dilution 1 : 2000 ) , then VacA 1 BCF ( at dilution 1 : 300 ) was added and cells were incubated for 10 min at 37°C . After triple rinsing with HBSS containing CD or DMSO , cells were incu - bated for 5 h at 37°C in HBSS / NH 4 Cl containing CD or DMSO . To verify the effect of CD on cells previously loaded with VacA , cells were intoxicated as above , maintained in HBSS for 2 h at 37°C , and then incubated for 5 h at 37°C with CD or DMSO in HBSS / NH 4 Cl . At the end of each experiment , cell vacuolation was quantitated by means of neutral red uptake . Neutral Red Dye Uptake Assay The degree of cell vacuolation was quantitated by means of neutral red dye uptake in accordance with Cover et al . ( 1991 ) , and was expressed as micrograms of neutral red per micrograms of cell protein ( Ricci et al . , 1993 ) . Protein content of cell monolayers was measured in accordance with Lowry et al . ( 1951 ) . Neutral red is an acidotropic , membrane - permeate amine that accumulates in the vacuolar lumen ( Ohkuma and Poole , 1981 ; Cover et al . , 1991 ) . Neu - tral red uptake is a widely accepted in vitro assay for H . pylori - induced cell vacuolation ( Cover et al . , 1991 , 1992 ; Me´graud et al . , 1992 ; Papini et al . , 1993 , 1994 ; Ricci et al . , 1993 ) . Electron Microscopy HEp - 2 cell monolayers , either incubated or nonincubated with VacA 1 BCF , were washed twice with cacodylate buffer ( 0 . 2 M ( CH 3 ) 2 AsO 2 Na3H 2 O , pH 7 . 3 with HCl ) and ﬁxed with a freshly prepared mixture of one part 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde and two parts 1 % osmium tetroxide in cacodylate buffer for 40 min at 4°C . Fixed monolayers were dehydrated and then embedded in Epon - Araldite mixture directly in the culture well . Uranyl - lead stained ultrathin sections were viewed with a Zeiss EM 902 electron microscope ( Oberkochen , Germany ) . For the ultrastructural immunolocalization of VacA , we used the colloidal gold - labeling technique as previously described ( Ricci et al . , 1997 ) . Brieﬂy , ultrathin sections were collected on 300 mesh nickel grids , washed with buffer A ( 0 . 45 M NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 05 M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 ) , and incubated in nonimmune goat serum at room temperature for 1 h , to prevent nonspeciﬁc binding of immunoglobulins . Some sections were then incubated overnight at 4°C with polyclonal rabbit anti - VacA serum ( serum 123 ; kindly given by T . L . Cover ) , diluted 1 : 600 in buffer B ( 0 . 45 M NaCl , 1 % BSA , 0 . 5 % sodium azide , 0 . 05 M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 ) , while other ( control ) sections were incubated with nonimmune or unrelated immune rabbit serum under the same conditions . After further washing in buffer B , primary immunoglobulin binding was re - vealed by gold - labeled goat antirabbit IgG ( EM GAR 20 , British BioCell , Cardiff , UK ) diluted 1 : 20 in buffer B . The sections were stained with uranyl and lead before electron microscopy investiga - tion . Quantitative evaluation of gold labeling and of endosomal / vacuolar and cytoplasmic areas was performed by means of an IBAS 2 image analyzer ( Zeiss ) . Cell Transfection Cells were grown on coverslip and transfected using the DOTAP transfection kit ( Boehringer Mannheim , Mannheim , Germany ) ac - cording to the manufacturer’s instructions . Cells were transfected with eukaryotic expression vectors allowing the overexpression of one or other of the following fusion proteins : 1 ) a dominant - nega - tive mutant of the Eps15 protein ( Edelta95 / 295 ) , tagged with the green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) ( Benmerah et al . , 1999 ) , 2 ) the ﬁve tandem Src - homology - 3 ( SH3 ) domains of intersectin , tagged with GFP ( Simpson et al . , 1999 ) ( kindly given by P . S . McPherson , Mon - treal , Canada ) , and 3 ) the K44A dominant - negative mutant of dy - namin II , tagged with a hemagglutinin ( HA ) epitope ( kindly given by C . Lamaze and S . Schmid , La Jolla , CA ) . To test the sensitivity to VacA in transfected cells , cells were washed as above , incubated for 10 min at 37°C with VacA 1 BCF ( at dilution 1 : 300 ) , rinsed three times , and then incubated for 16 h at 37°C in HBSS containing 3 mM NH 4 Cl to allow vacuole development . Transferrin Uptake Endocytosis of Texas Red - conjugated transferrin ( TxR - Tf ) ( Molecu - lar Probes , Eugene , OR ) was performed on cells grown on coverslip and variously transfected . Cells , treated with VacA 1 BCF and incu - bated for 16 h with HBSS containing 3 mM NH 4 Cl as described above , were incubated at 37°C for 1 h with 25 nM TxR - Tf in HBSS containing 1 mg / ml BSA and 3 mM NH 4 Cl . After incubation , cells were quickly cooled to 4°C , washed three times with ice - cold PBS , and then ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde as described below . Immunoﬂuorescence After triple washing in PBS , cells grown on coverslip were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) for 15 min . After ﬁxa - VacA Binding and Internalization Vol . 11 , November 2000 3899 tion , cells were washed three times in PBS and free aldehyde groups were quenched with 50 mM NH 4 Cl in PBS for 10 min . After two washes with PBS , cells were washed with PBS containing 0 . 5 % BSA and 0 . 5 % saponin ( both from Sigma ) for 5 min and then incubated with primary antibody in PBS / BSA / saponin for 30 min at RT . After triple rinsing of the cells with PBS / BSA / saponin , primary antibody binding was visualized with Cy5 - labeled donkey anti - rabbit ( from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , West Grove , PA ) or FITC - labeled goat anti - mouse ( from Dako , Glostrup , Denmark ) secondary antibodies diluted in PBS / BSA / saponin for 30 min at room tem - perature . After triple rinsing in PBS , the coverslips were mounted on glass slides in Mowiol ( Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA ) and analyzed by confocal microscopy . For double immunoﬂuorescence , cells were incubated with a mixture of the two primary antibodies and then with a mixture of the two secondary antibodies . As primary anti - bodies , in this study we used 1 ) anti - Rab7 rabbit polyclonal serum ( at dilution 1 : 200 ; kindly given by C . Bucci , Naples , Italy ) , and 2 ) anti - hemagglutinin mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5 ( at dilution 1 : 400 ; kindly given by E . Van Obberghen - Schilling , Nice , France ) . Statistics The statistical signiﬁcance of the differences was evaluated by the Student’s t test and by analysis of variance followed by Newman - Keuls’ Q test RESULTS HEp - 2 Cells Are Highly Sensitive to VacA , Whereas CHO Cells Exhibit a Low Sensitivity to the Toxin . We found that HEp - 2 cells exhibited a statistically signiﬁcant ( p , 0 . 05 ) neutral red uptake after continuous exposure to a low dose of VacA for 5 h or 16 h ( Figure 1A ) as well as after exposure to VacA for 1 h at 4°C followed by 5 h or 16 h incubation at 37°C in HBSS / NH 4 Cl to allow vacuole devel - opment ( Figure 1B ) . After intoxication for 1 h at 4°C , the ratio between the neutral red uptake of VacA - treated and untreated control cells evaluated at 5 h was 1 . 85 and 2 . 03 for VacA 1 BCF and puriﬁed VacA , respectively . These values were virtually identical to those obtained at 16 h ( 1 . 90 and 2 . 08 , respectively ) . When HEp - 2 cells were continuously exposed to VacA , the ratio between neutral red uptake of VacA - treated and control cells at 5 h was 3 . 80 and 4 . 04 for VacA 1 BCF and puriﬁed VacA , respectively . After 16 - h incubation , this ratio was slightly higher ( 4 . 50 and 4 . 65 for VacA 1 BCF and puriﬁed VacA , respectively ) . MKN 28 and HeLa cells , tested in the same conditions , exhibited the same behavior shown by HEp - 2 cells ( not shown ) . CHO cells also exhibited a statistically signiﬁcant ( p , 0 . 05 ) neutral red up - take after continuous exposure to a low dose of VacA for several hours at 37°C ( Figure 1A ) . However , unlike HEp - 2 cells , they were completely insensitive to VacA when ex - posed to the toxin for 1 h at 4°C ( Figure 1B ) . It is noteworthy that after continuous exposure to VacA for 16 h at 37°C , the ratio between neutral red uptake of VacA - treated and control cells ( 2 . 35 and 2 . 52 for VacA 1 BCF and puriﬁed VacA , respec - tively ) was about twice that observed after 5 - h incubation ( 1 . 40 and 1 . 55 ) . BHK 21 cells , tested in the same conditions , exhibited the same behavior shown by CHO cells ( not shown ) . A Speciﬁc Receptor for VacA Cannot Be Shown by 125 I - VacA Binding Experiments The above results raise the possibility that HEp - 2 cells ex - hibit a speciﬁc receptor which could be lacking in CHO cells . To investigate this possibility , we studied the binding of 125 I - VacA to HEp - 2 cells . In time - course experiments , we found no convincing plateau for binding of 125 I - VacA ( con - centration , 2 3 10 2 9 M ) even after 3 h ( not shown ) . More - over , we found no saturation of the binding by using differ - ent concentrations of 125 I - VacA ( concentration range from 5 3 10 2 10 M to 3 3 10 2 8 M ) ( not shown ) . As shown in Table 1 , we found a displacement of 34 % of cell - associated radio - activity by using a 50 - fold excess of nonradioactive VacA . Nevertheless , a comparable displacement was also obtained by using , instead of nonradioactive VacA , comparable Figure 1 . Neutral red uptake by HEp - 2 and CHO cells variously exposed to VacA .

The most effective competitor was 7 % FCS , which gave a 91 % displacement of cell radioactivity ( Table 1 ) . Binding experiments on CHO cells gave virtually the same behavior shown with HEp - 2 cells ( Table 1 ) . PI - PLC Treatment Inhibits VacA - induced Vacuolation of HEp - 2 Cells Even if binding data clearly demonstrated that most VacA molecules are probably nonspeciﬁcally adsorbed onto the cell membrane , this does not necessarily rule out the possi - bility that there could be a speciﬁc receptor in small amounts . In this respect , we tested whether VacA interaction with plasma membrane could exhibit some similarity with that of other bacterial channel - forming toxins like aerolysin from Aeromonas hydrophila and alpha toxin from Clostridium septicum , which are known to bind to GPI - anchored recep - tors that can be clustered in sphingolipid - cholesterol - rich microdomains ( Abrami et al . , 1998 ; Abrami and van der Goot , 1999 ; Gordon et al . , 1999 ) . To explore this possibility , we tested the effect of PI - PLC treatment ( a well - established approach to remove GPI - anchored molecules from the cell surface ) , in the presence of cycloheximide to prevent further synthesis of GPI - anchored proteins , followed by brief expo - sure ( 10 min ) of HEp - 2 cells to a very low dose of VacA ( both as VacA 1 BCF and as puriﬁed VacA ) . Note that CHO cells were completely insensitive to this intoxication protocol ( not shown ) . Figure 2 shows that PI - PLC treatment virtually abolished VacA - induced neutral red uptake in HEp - 2 cells . In parallel electron microscopy investigations ( Figure 3 ) , PI - PLC treated , VacA incubated HEp - 2 cells showed few dilated endosomes , only occasional cellular vacuoles , and markedly reduced intracellular endosomal / vacuolar accu - mulation of VacA immunoreactivity . The latter was found to be prominent in PI - PLC untreated , VacA incubated cells , mostly within cytoplasmic vacuoles and dilated endosomes ( Figure 3 ) . Quantitative analysis of 20 cell proﬁles ( randomly selected ) for each experimental condition showed that in PI - PLC untreated , VacA incubated cells the total endoso - mal / vacuolar area ( 4 , 060 m m 2 ) was ; 45 % of the total cyto - plasmic area ( 8 , 971 m m 2 ) and contained 2 , 240 gold grains , whereas in PI - PLC treated , VacA incubated cells the total endosomal / vacuolar area ( 526 m m 2 ) was ; 6 % of the total cytoplasmic area ( 8 , 615 m m 2 ) and contained 163 gold grains . The mean gold particles per micrometers squared of endo - somal / vacuolar area were 0 . 54 6 0 . 08 for PI - PLC untreated , VacA incubated cells and 0 . 35 6 0 . 07 for PI - PLC treated , VacA incubated cells ( means 6 SEM ; p 5 0 . 082 ) .

VacA Binding and Internalization Vol . 11 , November 2000 3901 ings suggest that when HEp - 2 cells are exposed to very low concentrations of VacA , a GPI - anchored protein could play a pivotal role in cell binding and internalization of VacA leading to cell vacuolation . To rule out the possibility that the PI - PLC effect we observed could be due to a toxic effect or to interference with vacuole development rather than to selective cleavage of a GPI - anchored protein required for high sensitivity to VacA , we treated VacA preloaded cells with PI - PLC . Figure 2 shows that under this condition PI - PLC treatment was completely ineffective and cells exhibited the same neutral red uptake as untreated cells . In addition , to rule out the possibility that our results might be biased by the speciﬁc batch or type of PI - PLC preparation used , we tested the effect of different batches of Figure 3 . Ultrastuctural features of HEp - 2 cells treated or not with PI - PLC and then exposed to VacA .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 3902 PI - PLC from Sigma and of PI - PLC from another supplier ( Oxford GlycoSciences , Abingdon , UK ) . We found no differ - ence in the results obtained using different Sigma batches ( not shown ) . Using 10 U / ml PI - PLC from Oxford Glyco - Sciences ( so as to obtain a release of alkaline phosphatase comparable with that of the Sigma preparations ) we ob - tained a statistically signiﬁcant ( p , 0 . 05 ) inhibition of neu - tral red uptake in HEp - 2 cells pretreated with PI - PLC , whereas neutral red uptake by cells preloaded with VacA and then treated with PI - PLC was virtually identical to that of cells not treated with PI - PLC ( not shown ) . The ﬁnding that PI - PLC treatment also impaired neutral red uptake in HeLa cells exposed to very low doses of VacA ( data not shown ) suggests that the sensitivity to PI - PLC treatment we observed is not unique to HEp - 2 cells . To test whether PI - PLC treatment has any effect on 125 I - VacA binding , we performed binding experiments on HEp - 2 cells treated with PI - PLC . We found that PI - PLC treatment had no signiﬁcant effect on 125 I - VacA binding ( not shown ) . Nystatin Treatment Inhibits VacA - induced Vacuolation of HEp - 2 Cells To determine whether sphingolipid - cholesterol - rich mi - crodomains play some role in cell intoxication by VacA , we studied VacA vacuolating activity in HEp - 2 cells treated with nystatin . This drug complexes cholesterol altering structure and function of glycolipid microdomains and caveolae ( Rothberg et al . , 1992 ; Deckert et al . , 1996 ; Skretting et al . , 1999 ) . Nystatin is reported to exhibit no effect on clathrin - coated pits , actin cables , or other membranous structures ( Rothberg et al . , 1992 ) . HEp - 2 cells treated with nystatin before VacA pulse exhibited no statistically signif - icant neutral red uptake in comparison to control cells ( i . e . , cells not exposed to VacA pulse ) ( Figure 4 ) . On the contrary , cells treated with nystatin , after VacA pulse , showed statis - tically signiﬁcant ( p , 0 . 05 ) neutral red uptake compared with control cells , even if less ( p , 0 . 05 ) than that exhibited by cells preloaded with VacA and treated with DMSO alone ( Figure 4 ) . VacA Internalization in HEp - 2 Cells is Insensitive to the Inhibition of Clathrin - dependent Endocytosis , Whereas It Is Inhibited by F - actin Depolymerization Results obtained with PI - PLC treatment suggested that a receptorial role could be played by GPI - anchored molecules , known to be internalized mainly via clathrin - independent endocytosis ( Parton et al . , 1994 ; Stahl and Mueller , 1995 ; Deckert et al . , 1996 ; Skretting et al . , 1999 ) . Therefore the possibility arises that a clathrin - independent pathway of endocytosis might play a role in VacA cell uptake . To inves - tigate this possibility , we performed transient tranfections of HEp - 2 cells with vectors allowing overexpression of pro - teins speciﬁcally inhibiting the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles . We induced overexpression of 1 ) a GFP - linked dominant - negative mutant ( Edelta95 / 295 ) of the Eps15 , a protein recently identiﬁed as a constituent of plasma mem - brane clathrin - coated pits and required for the earliest steps of clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Benmerah et al . , 1998 , 1999 ) . The expression of Edelta95 / 295 mutant protein is known to induce an inhibition of coated pit assembly at a very early step ( i . e . , coat protein recruitment onto the plasma membrane ) causing speciﬁc inhibition of clathrin - dependent receptor - mediated endocytosis , whereas ﬂuid phase endocytosis is not inhibited ( Benmerah et al . , 1999 ) ; 2 ) GFP - linked ﬁve tandem SH3 domains of intersectin , causing an inhibition of intermediate events leading to the formation of constricted coated pits ( Simpson et al . , 1999 ) ; and 3 ) the K44A mutant of dynamin II ( HA - tagged ) . Overexpression of this mutant protein ( Lys44 3 Ala ) potently and speciﬁcally inhibits the clathrin - dependent endocytosis , its inhibiting action being accounted for by its deﬁciency in GTP binding and hydrolysis which impairs the ﬁssion of invaginated coated pits ( Lamaze and Schmid , 1995 ) . Cells overexpressing proteins able to block clathrin - de - pendent endocytosis exhibited virtually no uptake of TxR - Tf ( a bona ﬁde marker of this kind of endocytosis ) , whereas VacA - dependent cell vacuolation ( evaluated as typical , Rab 7 - decorated , cytoplasmic vacuoles ) was virtually identical to that of the neighboring , nontransfected cells ( Figure 5 ) . These data clearly suggest that VacA internalization sufﬁ - cient to give full biological activity occurred even if the clathrin - dependent pathway was inhibited . We next studied whether VacA internalization was actin - dependent by using CD , a well - known microﬁlament - dis - rupting agent . It has been reported that the actin cytoskele - ton plays a role in different types of endocytic mechanisms : clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ) , clath - rin - independent endocytosis ( Sandvig and van Deurs , 1990 ; van Deurs et al . , 1995 ) , macropinocytosis ( Poussin et al . , 1998 ) , and caveolae - mediated internalization ( Parton et al . , 1994 ; Lamaze and Schmid , 1995 ) . We found that while CD treatment was only scantly effective in cells preloaded with Figure 4 . Effect of nystatin ( Nyst ) treatment on VacA - induced vacuolation of HEp - 2 cells . Neutral red uptake was measured either 1 ) in cells previously exposed to VacA 1 BCF pulse , or in control cells and then treated with Nyst dissolved in DMSO or with DMSO alone ( VacA preloaded ) ; or 2 ) in cells treated with Nyst dissolved in DMSO , or with DMSO alone and then exposed or not ( Control ) to VacA 1 BCF pulse ( VacA afterloaded ) ( see Methods ) .

VacA Binding and Internalization Vol . 11 , November 2000 3903 VacA , when cells were allowed to internalize VacA in the presence of CD there was no statistically signiﬁcant neutral red uptake in comparison to control cells ( Figure 6 ) . DISCUSSION Right from the ﬁrst paper showing the existence of VacA ( Leunk et al . , 1988 ) , it was clear that sensitivity to this toxin varies greatly among different cell lines tested , CHO cells being classiﬁed as insensitive . Further studies conﬁrmed this cell type - speciﬁc sensitivity to VacA and proposed that it could be due to the absence or presence ( with different levels of expression ) of a speciﬁc plasma membrane receptor ( Ya - hiro et al . , 1997 ; de Bernard et al . , 1998 ; Pagliaccia et al . , 1998 ; Padilla et al . , 2000 ) . Interestingly , Pagliaccia et al . ( 1998 ) proposed that VacA may have two different receptor bind - ing sites , one speciﬁc for the m1 variant and the other speciﬁc for the m2 variant . This could partly account for the different sensitivity among different cell lines tested . Differ - ently to previous investigators , in the present study we evaluated cell sensitivity to VacA by using a single , low concentration of a single type of VacA ( s1a / m1 ) but two different protocols of intoxication : 1 ) continuous exposure for several hours at 37°C so as to allow both speciﬁc and nonspeciﬁc binding and internalization ; and 2 ) exposure for 1 h at 4°C so as to block endocytosis allowing only binding to membrane receptors ( if any ) , followed by several hours at 37°C in the presence of NH 4 Cl to allow internalization of bound toxin and vacuole development . This approach en - abled us to classify the cell lines tested into two groups in respect to their sensitivity to VacA . The ﬁrst group was represented by cells ( HEp - 2 , MKN 28 , HeLa ) with high Figure 5 . VacA - induced vacuolation in HEp - 2 cells overexpressing proteins speciﬁcally inhibiting the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles . HEp - 2 cells grown on coverslip were transiently transfected with vectors allowing overexpression of 1 ) a dominant - negative mutant of the Eps15 protein , tagged with GFP ( GFP - Edelta95 / 295 ) ( A - D ) ; 2 ) the ﬁve tandem SH3 domains of intersectin , tagged with GFP ( GFP - Intersectin - SH3 ) ( E - H ) ; and 3 ) the K44A dominant - negative mutant of dynamin II , tagged with a HA epitope ( HA - Dynamin II K44A ) ( I - L ) . Transfected monolayers were exposed to VacA 1 BCF pulse , incubated for 16 h at 37°C in HBSS containing 3 mM NH 4 Cl , and then tested for TxR - Transferrin endocytosis as described in Methods . After ﬁxations , cells were processed for immunoﬂuorescence to detect Rab7 - positive vacuoles and , where required , HA tag . ( A , E , I ) : transfected cells ( green ) .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 3904 sensitivity , deﬁned as the capacity to develop vacuoles not only after continuous exposure to the toxin for several hours , but also after a pulse of VacA at 4°C . It is worth noting that substantial neutral red uptake can also be ob - tained in HEp - 2 by using a 1 - min pulse ( V . Ricci and P . Boquet , unpublished data ) . On the contrary , the cell lines of the second group ( CHO and BHK 21 ) resulted to be sensitive to VacA only when VacA was continuously present in the cell medium for several hours at 37°C . Interestingly , whereas in CHO cells there was an important difference ( about two times ) between neutral red uptake after 5 h and 16 h of continuous exposure to VacA , this difference was sharply reduced in HEp - 2 . This suggests that the intoxica - tion kinetics for CHO cells is very slow in comparison to that of HEp - 2 cells , which also exhibited a much higher amount of neutral red uptake . A possible explanation for these data is that the high sensitivity of cell lines of the I group was due to the presence of a speciﬁc receptor which is lacking on cell lines of the II group . By using indirect immunoﬂuorescence , ﬂow cytom - etry , and immunoprecipitation , some authors presented data suggesting the existence of a speciﬁc , high - afﬁnity cell surface receptor for VacA , although they failed to agree on its molecular characteristics ( Yahiro et al . , 1997 , 1999 ; Mas - sari et al . , 1998 ; Seto et al . , 1998 ; Padilla et al . , 2000 ) . However , none of these studies used the classic iodinated - ligand bind - ing approach for the characterization of the putative recep - tor for VacA . Surprisingly , by using this approach , we found no evidence of a speciﬁc receptor in HEp - 2 cells . The dis - placement achieved using an excess of nonradioactive VacA was unspeciﬁc since it was also obtained by using unrelated proteins ( like diphtheria toxin and cytotoxic necrotizing fac - tor 1 ) or , even more , by using 7 % FCS . In addition , we found virtually the same displacement behavior in CHO cells . Our data conﬁrm and extend recent observations ( Vinion - Dubiel et al . , 1999 ; McClain et al . , 2000 ) that HeLa cells exhibit a high level of noncompetable ( nonspeciﬁc ) binding for VacA with only a small reduction in the presence of a 100 - fold excess of unlabeled VacA . Our evidence of strong competition be - tween VacA and FCS in binding experiments also ﬁts very well with the data of de Bernard et al . ( 1998 ) showing an increased sensitivity to VacA with diminishing FCS concen - tration in the incubation medium , particularly relevant at low toxin concentration ( , 10 nM ) . The previously reported binding of VacA to multiple cell - surface proteins ( Yahiro et al . , 1997 , 1999 ; Seto et al . , 1998 ) might explain , at least in part , our failure to observe saturable and speciﬁc binding for VacA . In addition , the previously reported binding of VacA to lipid membranes ( Moll et al . , 1995 ; Molinari et al . , 1998 ; Czajkowsky et al . , 1999 ) might have contributed to the “non - speciﬁc” binding we observed . In any case , the lack of evidence of a speciﬁc receptor in radioactive binding experiments does not rule out the pos - sibility that there could be a functionally important , though quantitatively small , speciﬁc receptor in addition to the non - speciﬁc binding . This is , for example , the case of diphtheria toxin on HeLa cells . HeLa cells are sensitive to diphtheria toxin because they have its speciﬁc receptor ( now identiﬁed as heparin - binding EGF - like precursor ) ; nevertheless , by us - ing the 125 I - toxin binding approach , no speciﬁc binding has been measured , at variance with the case of other cell lines ( like Vero ) which exhibit larger numbers of binding sites ( Middlebrook et al . , 1978 ; Skretting et al . , 1999 ) . Since mounting evidence suggests a channel - forming ac - tion for VacA , an intriguing hypothesis may be that VacA interaction with plasma membrane has some similarities with that of other well - known bacterial channel - forming toxins . Aerolysin from Aeromonas hydrophila binds to GPI - anchored receptors and is clustered in sphingolipid - choles - terol - rich microdomains or “lipid rafts , ” which act as con - centration platforms favoring toxin oligomerization and channel formation ( Abrami et al . , 1998b ; Abrami and van der Goot , 1999 ) . Alpha toxin from Clostridium septicum is another channel - forming toxin which exploits GPI - anchored recep - tors to intoxicate cells , cells defective in GPI - anchored pro - teins being insensitive to low concentrations of this toxin ( Gordon et al . , 1999 ) . Our ﬁndings that PI - PLC pretreatment ( to remove GPI - anchored proteins from plasma membrane ) inhibited VacA internalization as well as VacA - induced cell vacuolation in HEp - 2 cells suggest that one or several still unidentiﬁed GPI - anchored protein ( s ) could play a pivotal role in cell sensitivity to VacA . Although not all GPI anchors are PI - PLC sensitive , PI - PLC treatment is widely accepted as a standard for the presence of GPI - anchored proteins ( Fer - guson , 1999 ) . The fact that HEp - 2 cells preloaded with VacA and then treated with PI - PLC exhibited neutral red uptake virtually identical to that of cells not treated with PI - PLC strongly supports the speciﬁcity of PI - PLC action at the level of GPI - anchored proteins required for high sensitivity to VacA . However , PI - PLC treatment had no substantial effect on 125 I - VacA binding to HEp - 2 cells , further demonstrating that VacA binding is for the most part nonspeciﬁc and Figure 6 . Effect of cytochalasin D ( CD ) treatment on VacA - induced vacuolation of HEp - 2 cells . Neutral red uptake was measured either 1 ) in cells previously exposed to VacA 1 BCF pulse , or in control cells and then treated with CD dissolved in DMSO or with DMSO alone ( VacA preloaded ) ; or 2 ) in cells treated with CD dissolved in DMSO , or with DMSO alone and then exposed or not ( Control ) to VacA 1 BCF pulse ( VacA afterloaded ) ( see Methods ) .

VacA Binding and Internalization Vol . 11 , November 2000 3905 suggesting that the number of speciﬁc receptors , if any , should be very low . Although VacA interaction with plasma membrane seems to share some properties with other channel - forming toxins , it also exhibits some peculiarities . Aerolysin binds to a broad subset of GPI - anchored proteins , the anchor being itself an essential part of the toxin binding determinant ( Diep et al . , 1998 ; Abrami et al . , 2000 ) . Both CHO and BHK 21 cells are highly sensitive to aerolysin since they exhibit GPI - anchored proteins suitable as receptors ( Abrami et al . , 1998a , b ) . The fact that both CHO and BHK 21 cells were insensitive to a pulse of a low dose of VacA at 4°C suggests that GPI - anchored proteins with highly speciﬁc features are required for high cell sensitivity to VacA . An increasing body of evidence suggests that GPI - an - chored proteins are clustered in lipid rafts ( Ferguson , 1999 ; Muniz and Riezman , 2000 ) and that lipid rafts play a pivotal role in cell intoxication by several bacterial toxins ( Orlandi and Fishman , 1998 ; Abrami and van der Goot , 1999 ; Fivaz et al . , 1999 ) . In this respect , the possibility that a GPI - anchored protein could play a role as VacA receptor prompted us to verify whether alteration of structure / function of lipid rafts could inhibit VacA - induced vacuolation in HEp - 2 cells . This was indeed the case . We found that nystatin , a cholesterol - binding drug known to impair both structure and function of lipid rafts and caveolae ( Rothberg et al . , 1992 ; Deckert et al . , 1996 ; Skretting et al . , 1999 ) , induced almost complete inhibition of VacA - induced cell vacuolation in HEp - 2 cells . This ﬁnding suggests that lipid rafts could play an impor - tant role in cell intoxication by VacA . However , it is note - worthy that nystatin also caused a slight , but statistically signiﬁcant , inhibition of neutral red uptake in cells pre - loaded with VacA and then treated with the drug , suggest - ing that nystatin - induced alteration of lipid rafts may also interfere with vacuole genesis . Although the fact that VacA needs to be internalized to exert its vacuolating activity is widely accepted ( Garner and Cover , 1996 ; Ricci et al . , 1997 ; Pagliaccia et al . , 1998 ; Mon - tecucco et al . , 1999 ; Vinion - Dubiel et al . , 1999 ; McClain et al . , 2000 ) , the mechanisms of VacA internalization are still largely unknown . The fact that high cell sensitivity to VacA depends on a GPI - anchored protein of the cell surface and that GPI - anchored molecules are known to be internalized mainly via clathrin - independent endocytosis ( Parton et al . , 1994 ; Stahl and Mueller , 1995 ; Deckert et al . , 1996 ; Skretting et al . , 1999 ) raises the possibility that clathrin - independent endocytosis may play a major role in VacA internalization . Our data show that VacA internalization sufﬁcient to give full biological activity did occur even if the clathrin - depen - dent pathway was virtually completely inhibited . However these data did not rule out the possibility that VacA could simply cross the plasma membrane to penetrate directly into the cytosol where it could exert its vacuolating action ( Mo - linari et al . , 1998 ) . Since actin cytoskeleton plays a role in different forms of vesicle - mediated internalization , our ﬁnd - ing that pretreatment with the microﬁlament - disrupting agent CD blocked VacA internalization ( evaluated as inhi - bition of VacA - induced cell vacuolation ) supports a vesicle - mediated internalization of VacA . CD is known to affect both clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ) and clathrin - independent endocytosis ( Sandvig and van Deurs , 1990 ; van Deurs et al . , 1995 ) as well as macropinocy - tosis ( Poussin et al . , 1998 ) and caveolae - mediated internal - ization ( Parton et al . , 1994 ; Lamaze and Schmid , 1995 ) . CD inhibits cytotoxicity both of ricin toxin ( which exploits both clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent endocytosis to enter cells ) and of diphtheria toxin ( which exploits only the clathrin - dependent pathway ) ( Sandvig and van Deurs , 1990 ; P . Boquet and V . Ricci , unpublished data ) . Taken together , our results suggest that clathrin - independent endocytosis plays a major role in VacA internalization . The recent obser - vation that VacA binds to the surface of rabbit erythrocytes but is not able to enter these cells ( McClain et al . , 2000 ) further suggests that VacA internalization does not occur spontaneously following binding to membranes . In the ﬁrst paper dealing with VacA binding and internal - ization , Garner and Cover ( 1996 ) reported that VacA exhib - its a very slow rate of internalization in comparison to other bacterial toxins like diphtheria toxin , Pseudomonas exotoxin A , and botulinum C2 toxin . Interestingly , Skretting et al . ( 1999 ) found that internalization of diphtheria toxin bound to a mutated receptor , where the transmembrane and cyto - plasmic domains had been replaced by a GPI - moiety , was clathrin - independent and occurred at a low rate compared with clathrin - dependent internalization of the same toxin bound to wild - type receptors . These observations well ﬁt with our ﬁndings of clathrin - independent internalization of VacA after binding to a GPI - anchored protein . Nevertheless , our ﬁnding that also CHO and BHK 21 cells developed vacuoles when exposed to VacA for several hours at 37°C and the fact that the PI - PLC - induced protec - tive action in HEp - 2 cells seemed to disappear when either VacA concentration or the time of cell exposure to the toxin were increased ( our unpublished results ) raise the possibil - ity that multiple binding sites and / or multiple internaliza - tion pathways might contribute to cell intoxication by VacA , especially when high doses of , or long time of exposure to , VacA are used . Recently , Montecucco et al . ( 1999 ) proposed a model for cell intoxication by VacA . Brieﬂy , monomeric VacA binds , via its carboxy - terminal domain , to an unidentiﬁed cell re - ceptor and inserts into the plasma membrane via hydropho - bic protein - lipid interactions . The formation of anion - selec - tive channels results from assembling of monomers into an oligomeric structure . VacA endocytosis and transport to late endosomes could increase the anionic permeability of this compartment , which in turn would enhance the V - ATPase proton pumping activity leading , in the presence of weak bases like ammonia , to an increased accumulation of osmot - ically active ions ( like NH 4 1 ) . This leads to water inﬂux and vesicle swelling , an essential step in vacuole formation . Our data ﬁt very well with Montecucco’s model . A pos - sible scenario might be the following : 1 ) in highly sensitive cells exposed to a low dose of the toxin , VacA monomers bind to one or several GPI - anchored protein ( s ) ; 2 ) subse - quent interaction between VacA monomers , required for the oligomerization step and channel formation , are favored both by the high lateral mobility of GPI - anchored proteins within the phospholipid bilayer and by the capacity of GPI - anchored proteins to associate with lipid rafts ; 3 ) lipid rafts can thus act as concentration platforms enabling VacA to concentrate locally and , therefore , to oligomerize efﬁciently ; and 4 ) subsequent clathrin - independent endocytosis and V .
