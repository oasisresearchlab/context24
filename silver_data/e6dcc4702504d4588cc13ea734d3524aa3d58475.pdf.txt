Mechani - cal stimuli are a key input to YAP activity , but the mechanisms controlling this regulation remain largely uncharacterized . We show that CAV1 posi - tively modulates the YAP mechanoresponse to sub - strate stiffness through actin - cytoskeleton - depen - dent and Hippo - kinase - independent mechanisms . RHO activity is necessary , but not sufﬁcient , for CAV1 - dependent mechanoregulation of YAP activ - ity . Systematic quantitative interactomic studies and image - based small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) screens provide evidence that this actin - dependent regulation is determined by YAP interaction with the 14 - 3 - 3 protein YWHAH . Constitutive YAP acti - vation rescued phenotypes associated with CAV1 loss , including defective extracellular matrix ( ECM ) remodeling . CAV1 - mediated control of YAP activity was validated in vivo in a model of pancreatitis - driven acinar - to - ductal metaplasia . We propose that this CAV1 - YAP mechanotransduction system controls a signiﬁcant share of cell programs linked to these two pivotal regulators , with potentially broad physiological and pathological implications . INTRODUCTION The integral membrane protein Caveolin - 1 ( CAV1 ) engages in crosstalk with the actin cytoskeleton and connects directly to actin cables through the protein FLNA ( Muriel et al . , 2011 ; Stahl - hut and van Deurs , 2000 ) . CAV1 controls focal adhesion stability , actin organization , and actomyosin contraction through RHO GTPases ( Echarri et al . , 2007 ; Goetz et al . , 2011 ; Grande - Garcı´a et al . , 2007 ) and contributes to mechanosensing and adaptation in response to various mechanical stimuli , such as membrane stretching , shear stress , hypoosmotic shock , and cell detach - ment ( Boyd et al . , 2003 ; Muriel et al . , 2011 ; Sinha et al . , 2011 ) . However , current understanding remains limited regarding the mechanisms by which these phenomena are integrated with overall cell function . The transcriptional cofactor yes - associated protein ( YAP ) operates downstream of the canonical Hippo pathway ( Piccolo et al . , 2014 ) , a highly conserved pathway regulating organ growth control , tissue homeostasis , and tumorigenesis ( Yu et al . , 2015 ) . YAP regulates the transcription of speciﬁc gene sets mainly through its interaction with TEA domain ( TEAD ) tran - scription factors ( Zhao et al . , 2008 ) . A cascade of kinases , including LATS1 and LATS2 , lead to YAP phosphorylation and curb its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling , mediating its cytosolic retention through interaction with 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , thus downre - gulating YAP transcriptional output ( Dong et al . , 2007 ; Hao et al . , 2008 ; Zhao et al . , 2007 ) . This regulatory network is controlled by upstream cues related to tissue architecture and cellular context , such as cell - cell adhesion , cell density , and cell polarity ( Piccolo et al . , 2014 ) . YAP is also controlled by mechanical signals , such as extracellular matrix ( ECM ) stiffness , shear stress , and stretch - ing ( Codelia et al . , 2014 ; Dupont et al . , 2011 ; Zhong et al . , 2013 ) . Stiff environments favor YAP nuclear localization ( i . e . , activation ) , whereas attachment to soft substrates increases cytoplasmic retention . This mechanical control , which determines cell prolif - eration and differentiation ( Dupont et al . , 2011 ) , depends on RHO GTPase function and actomyosin - driven contractility but is largely independent of kinase regulation , because ( 1 ) depletion of LATS1 / 2 kinases does not alter the mechanical responsive - ness of YAP and ( 2 ) non - phosphorylatable mutants are nonethe - less sensitive to substrate stiffness ( Dupont et al . , 2011 ; Elose - gui - Artola et al . , 2017 ) . The adaptation of nuclear pore units to mechanical tension also contributes to the regulation of YAP nu - clear entry ( Elosegui - Artola et al . , 2017 ) . However , understand - ing is limited about the exact molecular mechanisms by which ECM stiffness controls YAP activity . Here , we identify CAV1 as an upstream positive regulator of YAP that affects the response 1622 Cell Reports 25 , 1622 – 1635 , November 6 , 2018 ª 2018 The Authors .

The mechanical regulation of YAP underpins pathophysiolog - ical processes such as cardiovascular disease , inﬂammation and tissue regeneration , and cancer ( Panciera et al . , 2017 ) . YAP activation by ECM stiffness promotes cancer - associated ﬁbroblast activation and subsequent peritumoral ECM remodel - ing and stiffening , establishing a positive - feedback loop that fa - vors cancer progression ( Calvo et al . , 2013 ) . Here , we show that overexpression of constitutively active YAP mutants rescues the blunted contractility and ECM remodeling previously reported for Cav1 genetic deﬁciency ( Goetz et al . , 2011 ) . The positive impact of YAP activity on tumor initiation and progression is further showcased by its critical contribution to pancreatitis - induced acinar - to - ductal metaplasia ( ADM ) , which favors pancreatic ductal carcinoma ( PDAC ) initiation ( Gruber et al . , 2016 ) . We further demonstrate CAV1 - dependent positive regula - tion of YAP in vivo , showing that Cav1 - knockout ( Cav1KO ) pancreatic parenchyma fails to upregulate YAP in response to induced pancreatitis and exhibits blunting of changes associ - ated with YAP activation , such as ADM . Our results provide important insight into the mechanisms regulating YAP function . We identify CAV1 as an upstream regu - lator of YAP , controlling its transcriptional activity through the control of actin cytoskeleton dynamics . Conversely , YAP under - pins an important share of CAV1 - dependent phenotypes . We propose this CAV1 - YAP regulation has important implications in the progression of some pathologies , such as cancer , and will allow us to better understand the principles governing pro - cesses driven by substrate stiffness in health and disease . RESULTS CAV1 Positively Regulates YAP Activity by Controlling YAP Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling ECM stiffness mediates CAV1 internalization ( Du et al . , 2011 ) . We conﬁrmed that CAV1 was internalized in cells grown on soft substrates ( Figure S1A ) and trafﬁcked to a RAB11 - positive recycling endosome ( Figure S1B ) . Thus , cell detachment from integrin - ECM - mediated adhesions and cell growth on soft sub - strates both trigger the same translocation of CAV1 from the plasma membrane toward a recycling endosome ( del Pozo et al . , 2005 ; Muriel et al . , 2011 ) . These observations suggest that CAV1 could mediate the response to changes in substrate rigidity . To evaluate the potential contribution of CAV1 to ECM stiffness mechanotransduction , we performed RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) in wild - type ( WT ) and Cav1KO mouse embryonic ﬁ - broblasts ( MEFs ) cultured on rigid or compliant polyacrylamide hydrogels ( GEO : GSE120514 ) . Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ( IPA ) software and the Enrichr open - source tool ( Chen et al . , 2013 ; Kuleshov et al . , 2016 ) , we queried our datasets for canon - ical functional programs and Gene Ontology terms responsive to substrate rigidity , classifying them according to their speciﬁcity for WT or Cav1KO backgrounds ( Figures S1C and S1D ) . This analysis identiﬁed a stiffness - induced increase in genes related to the regulation of actin cytoskeleton , focal adhesions , and cell junctions exclusively in WT cells . To explore the molecular mechanisms mediating this effect of CAV1 on gene expression , we focused on YAP because this transcriptional cofactor is a prominent transcriptional driver of genes involved in cell adhesion and actin cytoskeleton organi - zation ( Stein et al . , 2015 ) and is also positively regulated by mechanical cues such as ECM stiffness ( Dupont et al . , 2011 ) . To assess whether YAP function was controlled by substrate stiffness in our system , we ﬁrst analyzed the expression of a panel of 61 genes previously characterized as YAP targets in MCF10A and NIH 3T3 cells ( Dupont et al . , 2011 ; Zhao et al . , 2008 ) . A Fisher exact test conﬁrmed statistically signiﬁcant upre - gulation of endogenous YAP targets by ECM stiffness in WT cells , but not in Cav1KO cells ( Figure 1A ) . This ﬁnding was sup - ported by qRT - PCR analysis of the YAP targets Ankrd1 and Ctgf ( Figure 1B ) and by orthogonal assays to monitor TEAD activity ( Figure 1C ) based on the 8xGTIIC luciferase reporter ( Dupont et al . , 2011 ) . To explore the mechanism of this CAV1 depen - dency , we ﬁrst studied YAP subcellular distribution ( Figure 1D ) , which was classiﬁed as cytosolic ( C ) , nuclear ( N ) , or evenly Figure 1 .

( legend continued on next page ) Cell Reports 25 , 1622 – 1635 , November 6 , 2018 1625 distributed ( N / C ) ( Figure 1E ) . As expected , YAP was predomi - nantly nuclear in WT cells plated on stiff substrate and retained in the cytosol in cells plated on soft substrate . However , in Cav1KO MEFs , YAP was predominantly retained in the cyto - plasm independently of substrate rigidity and compliance . Defective YAP nuclear localization in Cav1KO cells was conﬁrmed by biochemical fractionation ( Figure S1E ) . These re - sults indicate that the positive regulation of YAP transcriptional activity by environmental rigidity is CAV1 dependent . To rule out a cell - speciﬁc effect on YAP - CAV1 functional inter - actions , we used small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) duplexes to tran - siently knock down CAV1 in epithelial MDA - MB - 231 human breast carcinoma cells . CAV1 silencing signiﬁcantly decreased Ctgf and Ankrd1 expression ( Figure S1G ) . Moreover , qRT - PCR proﬁling of immortalized neonatal mouse hepatocytes revealed a similar reduction in YAP target gene expression in cells har - vested from Cav1KO mice compared with those from WT mice ( Figure S1H ) . To further assess the robustness of the CAV1 - YAP interaction , we used the SEEK open - access resource ( Zhu et al . , 2015 ) to query known YAP target genes for coexpres - sion patterns against the whole genome across extensive data - sets from different tissues and cell lines ( Figure 1F ; Table S1 ) . Cav1 , whose mRNA levels highly correlate with its protein expression ( Sonntag et al . , 2014 ) , showed one of the highest expression correlations with our YAP target list query ( 0 . 4994 ) . These observations were upheld by the analysis of an indepen - dent dataset , generated by assessing the correlation between the expression of Cav1 and the rest of the genome across 300 cell lines ( Pellinen et al . , 2018 ) ; in this analysis , 79 % of YAP target genes correlated positively with Cav1 expression and 11 % correlated negatively ( Figure S1G ) . Together , these observations suggest that CAV1 - dependent regulation of YAP transcriptional activity is a general mechanism operating across different exper - imental systems . Simultaneous siRNA - mediated knockdown of YAP and TAZ , to prevent potential compensatory mechanisms , effectively blocked expression of the canonical targets Ctgf and Ankrd1 in WT MEFs ( Figures S1J and S1K ) . Consistent with a pivotal role for CAV1 in the positive regulation of YAP , YAP / TAZ silencing in Cav1KO cells did not further decrease Ctgf , Ankrd1 , and Cyr61 expression . Notably , CAV1 absence did not alter total YAP protein levels ( Figure S1J ) , suggesting that the relationship between CAV1 and YAP - dependent transcriptional programs re - lies on CAV1 - dependent regulatory mechanisms upstream of YAP and not on the regulation of YAP protein expression . Cell spreading modulates YAP activity such that YAP is pre - dominantly nuclear in cells spread over large areas and cytosolic in cells with limited spreading ( Dupont et al . , 2011 ) . Moreover , cell polarization and spreading in MEFs is controlled by CAV1 ( Grande - Garcı´a et al . , 2007 ) . To rule out the possibility that CAV1 - dependent differences in YAP activity were secondary to differential cell spreading , we cultured MEFs on printed ﬁbro - nectin micropatterns of ﬁxed area and shape . As expected , YAP was predominantly cytosolic in WT MEFs spreading over small micropatterns , whereas growth on large micropatterns promoted a marked nuclear accumulation . This regulation was blunted in CAV1 - deﬁcient cells ( Figures 1G and 1H ) . These observations conﬁrm that CAV1 - dependent YAP modulation is not an indirect consequence of changes in cell geometry . To assess this relationship in the context of other mechanical cues , we evaluated the role of CAV1 in cell stretching , another established YAP - activating stimulus ( Aragona et al . , 2013 ; Code - lia et al . , 2014 ) . Using a stretching device , we exposed cells to uniaxial cyclic strain . Stretching induced signiﬁcant increases in Ctgf and Ankrd1 expression in WT MEFs , but not in Cav1KO cells ( Figure 1I ) , suggesting that CAV1 modulates YAP activity in response to different stimuli . CAV1 - Dependent Regulation of YAP Is Independent of Hippo Kinase We observed that YAP phosphorylation at S112 was increased in Cav1KO MEFs , and this increase was partly blocked by exoge - nous CAV1 expression ( Figure 2A ) . Previous reports proposed the existence of nuclear pools of S127 - phosphorylated YAP in human cells ( Wada et al . , 2011 ) , but our biochemical partition as - says suggested that the phosphorylated form of the mouse ho - mologous residue S112 is largely excluded from the nucleus in our cellular model ( Figure S2A ) . YAP phosphorylation at serine 127 ( S112 in mice ) promotes the retention of this transcription factor in the cytosol ( Basu et al . , 2003 ; Zhao et al . , 2007 ) . We evaluated the involvement of YAP phosphorylation in CAV1 - dependent regulation ectopically expressing YAP - FLAG and the non - phosphorylatable mutant YAP - 5SA ( Figure S2B ) . We transiently transfected these constructs into WT and Cav1KO MEFs and analyzed their subcellular distribution by both immu - noﬂuorescence and subcellular fractionation ( Figures 2B – 2D ) . In WT MEFs , FLAG - tagged WT YAP was predominantly nuclear but was mostly retained in the cytosol in Cav1KO MEFs . How - ever , FLAG - tagged YAP - 5SA accumulated in the nucleus in both WT and Cav1KO MEFs , suggesting that cytosolic retention of YAP in Cav1KO MEFs is at least partially dependent on its regulated phosphorylation . Constitutive nuclear translocation of YAP - 5SA proteins in Cav1KO MEFs correlated with the rescue of its downstream transcriptional output . YAP - 5SA nu - clear accumulation in Cav1KO MEFs correlated with increased canonical YAP - TEAD transcriptional activity , assessed by 8xGTICC - luciferase reporter assay ( Figure 2E ) . In contrast , whereas WT YAP enhanced TEAD activity in WT MEFs , it did not in Cav1KO MEFs , consistent with the cytosolic sequestration of WT YAP - FLAG and endogenous YAP in Cav1KO MEFs . These resultswere conﬁrmed byqRT - PCRanalysis ( Figure S2C ) . It is important to note that while the fold increase was higher in Cav1KO cells , YAP - 5SA overexpression in Cav1KO cells did not reach the levels observed in WT cells , suggesting ( E ) TEADtranscriptionalactivityinMEFstransfectedwithYAP - FLAGandYAP ( S5A ) - FLAG , measuredby8xGTICC - luciferasereporterassay .

See also Figure S2 . 1626 Cell Reports 25 , 1622 – 1635 , November 6 , 2018 that phosphorylation - independent mechanisms could also be involved . Our observations indicate that YAP serine phosphory - lation has an impact on CAV1 - dependent control of YAP locali - zation and activity . YAP serine phosphorylation can be mediated by the kinases LATS1 and LATS2 ( Zhao et al . , 2007 ) . Knockdown of LATS1 / 2 increased Ctgf and Ankrd1 mRNA expression and TEAD - driven luciferase reporter activity in both WT and Cav1KO cells , with comparable fold increases ( Figures 2G , S2D , and S2E ) . To further evaluate the implication of Hippo canonical kinases in the differences observed between WT and Cav1KO cells , we analyzed the role of neuroﬁbromin 2 ( NF2 ) . NF2 silencing led to an increase in Ctgf and Ankrd1 expression in WT cells , but not in Cav1KO cells ( Figures 2H and S2F ) , supporting the existence of alternative regulation upon suppression of LATS1 / 2 kinase activity by NF2 knockdown and precluding rescue of YAP activity in Cav1KO cells . Taken together , these results suggest that LATS1 / 2 kinases are not essential for CAV1 - dependent YAP activity regulation . CAV1 - Dependent Regulation of YAP Activity Is Exerted through the Control of Actin Polymerization Since F - actin and RHO are necessary for YAP nuclear transloca - tion and transcriptional activity ( Dupont et al . , 2011 ) , we next checked whether changes in actin cytoskeleton and RHO signaling could explain the altered YAP regulation in Cav1KO MEFs . For the analysis of actin dynamics and architecture , WT and Cav1KO MEFs were cultured on large ﬁbronectin micropat - terns to ensure the same spreading area for both genetic back - grounds and thus exclude effects of spreading area on actin dy - namics of cell - cell interaction , spreading , and cell shape ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . Actin dynamics and architecture were also analyzed in cells cultured on stiff substrates ( Figure 3C ) . Actin ﬁber organi - zation was inferred by anisotropy analysis of microscopy images tomeasurethedegreeofdeparturefromahomogeneousdistribu - tion toward an increasingly discrete intensity distribution ( STAR Methods ) . Conﬁrming CAV1 as a regulator of actin cytoskeleton organization , actin ﬁbers were less organized in Cav1KO cells . We assessed the potential contribution of actin dynamics to CAV1 - dependent YAP regulation by using the actin polymer - ization inhibitor cytochalasin D ( CytD ) and jasplakinolide , an enhancer of F - actin actin polymerization ( Holzinger , 2009 ; Pren - tki et al . , 1979 ) . CytD decreased stress ﬁber density ( Figure S3A ) , reducing YAP nuclear accumulation and YAP target transcription throughput in WT cells to levels akin to those in Cav1KO cells ( Figures 3D and S3A ; see also Figures S3D and 4F ) . Conversely , jasplakinolide enhanced actin polymerization ( Figures S3B and S3C ) , restored YAP nuclear translocation in Cav1KO MEFs to WT levels ( Figures 3D and 3E ; see also Figure S3D ) , and increased YAP target gene expression in both WT and Cav1KO cells ( Figure 4F ) . A constitutively active DIAPH1 mutant ( mDia1 D N3 ) , capable of boosting actin polymerization rates ( Watanabe et al . , 1999 ) , signiﬁcantly upregulated YAP target expression in Cav1KO cells ( Figure S3E ) . These data strongly suggest that actin polymerization is a key component of the YAP regulatory machinery in our system . Altered actin dynamics in Cav1KO cells are the direct cause of the reduced YAP activity observed in this genetic background . We next explored the contribution of RHO signaling to actin - and CAV1 - dependent regulation of YAP using Y27632 , a well - established inhibitor of the upstream kinase ROCK1 / 2 . Exposure to Y27632 strongly reduced YAP target gene expression in WT cells , reproducing the effect of CytD ( see Figure 3A ) ; in contrast , Y27632 had only modest effects in Cav1KO cells ( Figure S3F ) . Transient transfection with a constitutively active form of RHOA ( RHOV14 ) that rescues RHO activity in Cav1KO MEFs ( Goetz et al . , 2011 ) further increased Ctgf and Ankrd1 expression in WT cells but did not enhance YAP target gene expression in Cav1KO cells ( Figure S3F ) . Our observations thus suggest that while RHO signaling is necessary for the CAV1 - dependent positive mechanoregulation of YAP activity , it is not sufﬁcient , since defective RHO cannot explain the deﬁcient YAP activity in Cav1KO cells . Deﬁcient YAP Activity in Cav1KO Cells Is Mediated by YWHAH - YAP Interaction To characterize the molecular mechanisms underpinning the ef - fect of CAV1 - dependent actin dynamics on YAP activity , we pro - ﬁled the YAP interactome by YAP immunoafﬁnity puriﬁcation and mass spectrometry ( MS ) of control and CytD - treated WT and Cav1KO cells ( Figure S5 ; Table S2 ) . We identiﬁed several previ - ously described YAP - interacting proteins : AMOTL2 ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) , POLR2A ( Gavva et al . , 1997 ) , TBX5 ( Rosenbluh et al . , 2012 ) , RUNX1 ( Levy et al . , 2008 ) , 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , and known members of the Hippo pathway interactome ( RBM15 , CORO1C , DBN1 , DOCK7 , LIMA1 , MTCL1 , PKP4 , RAD21 , and SLMAP ; Couzens et al . , 2013 ) . Interestingly , only WT cells showed inter - actions between YAP and nuclear pore and / or transport com - plexes , presumably reﬂecting effective nuclear translocation ( Figure 4A ) . Conversely , both Cav1KO and CytD - treated cells were enriched for interactions with 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , which are re - ported to retain phosphorylated YAP in the cytosol ( Dong et al . , 2007 ) ( Figure 4B ) . To assess the contribution to YAP regulation of each compo - nent of these context - speciﬁc YAP interactomes , we carried out an image - based RNAi focused screen by knocking down 89 identiﬁed YAP interactors and comparing YAP subcellular distri - bution in Cav1KO and WT cells ( STAR Methods ; Figures 4C , 4D , S4A – S4C , and S5 ) . Setting a stringent threshold of j Zq j > 2 . 5 , we identiﬁed hits speciﬁc to WT cells for 10 genes , whose knock - down blunted YAP nuclear translocation ( Figures 4D and 4E ) . These included siRNA pools targeting most nuclear pore com - ponents previously shown to selectively interact with YAP in WT cells ( NUP155 , NUP98 , and AHCTF ) . Conversely , 8 hits were identiﬁed as speciﬁc to Cav1KO cells , and siRNA - mediated depletion of these genes enhanced YAP nuclear translocation . This second subset included two Cav1KO - speciﬁc YAP interac - tors , the 14 - 3 - 3 - domain proteins YWHAH and YWHAB ( Figures 4D , 4E , and S4D ) . We conﬁrmed by western blot that YWHAH interacts preferentially with YAP in Cav1KO cells in CytD - treated WT cells compared with control WT cells ( Figure S4E ) . Accordingly , efﬁcient YWHAH siRNA - mediated depletion partially rescued the expression of YAP targets in Cav1KO cells and CytD - treated WT cells ( Figures 4F , S4F , and S4G ) . Notably , this rescue was not effective in cells grown on soft substrates , indicating that additional mechanisms might be involved in this Cell Reports 25 , 1622 – 1635 , November 6 , 2018 1627 A B D C E F Figure 3 .

Taken together , these unbiased approaches suggest that CAV1 determines YAP activity through the control of actin dynamics , via mechanisms involving inhibition of the interaction between YAP and 14 - 3 - 3 proteins such as YWHAH ( Figure 4G ) . YAP Is aMajor Effector of ECMRemodeling Downstream of CAV1 YAP and caveolins are involved in a number of pathophysiolog - ical processes , such as liver regeneration , muscular dystrophy , and ECM remodeling ( Bertrand et al . , 2014 ; Calvo et al . , 2013 ; Ferna´ndez et al . , 2006 ; Goetz et al . , 2011 ; Grijalva et al . , 2014 ; Hagiwara et al . , 2000 ; Minetti et al . , 1998 ) . We hypothesized that impaired ECM remodeling in CAV1 - deﬁcient cells ( Goetz et al . , 2011 ) might be caused by deﬁcient YAP activity . To test this , we transfected Cav1KO cells with either non - phosphorylat - able YAP - 5SA ( able to increase YAP transcriptional output in Cav1KO cells ; see Figures 3G and 3H ) or WT YAP . ECM remod - eling was assessed by ( 1 ) collagen gel contraction assay and ( 2 ) quantitative image analysis of collagen ﬁber organization by second harmonic generation ( SHG ) microscopy ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . As expected , ECM remodeling activity was blunted in Cav1KO MEFs . Interestingly , YAP - 5SA overexpression restored the ability of these cells to remodel the matrix , whereas WT YAP was ineffective . Furthermore , we observed a clear correlation between CAV1 expression and YAP nuclear localization in hu - man cancer - associated ﬁbroblasts ( CAFs ) from pancreatic tu - mors ( Figures 5C and 5D ) , and CAV1 silencing in these cells induced YAP cytosolic retention ( Figure 5D ) , supporting a major role for a CAV1 - YAP regulation in determining the activation state of stromal cell populations in vivo . Based on these observa - tions , we propose that CAV1 and YAP nucleate a signaling pathway that drives ECM remodeling and stiffening . CAV1 Is Required for YAP Activation in Pancreatitis - Associated ADM Pancreatitis causes tissue damage and desmoplasia , promoting the development of ADM and potentially contributing to PDAC onset and progression ( Guerra et al . , 2007 ) . We chose pancrea - titis as a model to study the potential contribution of CAV1 - YAP regulation in vivo , because YAP is required for pancreatitis - induced ADM ( Morvaridi et al . , 2015 ) and CAV1 expression is upregulated in pancreatic cancer and it is associated with decreased survival ( Chatterjee et al . , 2015 ) . Mild and reversible acute pancreatitis was induced in WT and Cav1KO mice by intraperitoneal administration of the cholecisto - kinin receptor agonist caerulein ( Niederau et al . , 1985 ) . 2 hr and 4 days after caerulein treatment , nuclear YAP expression was signiﬁcantly higher in WT preparations ( Figures 6A and 6B ) . This correlates with an increase in the areas presenting extensive ADM and ﬁbrosis , assessed by a SMA expression in pancreatic stellate cells 4 days after treatment ( Figures 6C , S6A , and S6B ) . Taken together , these data suggest that CAV1 is required for YAP activation in the context of caerulein - induced pancrea - titis and that this activation correlates with increased ADM in pancreatic tissue . DISCUSSION Our results identify CAV1 as an upstream regulator of YAP - dependent adaptive programs , working through mechanisms dependent on the control of actin dynamics . This CAV1 - depen - dent control of YAP activity relies , at least in part , on the revers - ible phosphorylation of YAP , evidenced by the association of blunted YAP activity in Cav1KO cells with increased YAP phos - phorylation and its rescued by exogenous expression of non - phosphorylatable YAP . We found no role for LATS1 / 2 in this mechano - dependent negative regulation , observing no YAP activity recovery either upon transient silencing of both kinases or upon silencing of NF2 . YAP might also be a substrate for JNK and Abl ( Codelia et al . , 2014 ; Levy et al . , 2008 ) or as - yet un - identiﬁed kinases that could be responsible for YAP regulation . Another possible explanation for increased YAP phosphorylation in the absence of CAV1 is a protection of phosphorylated YAP from dephosphorylation through interaction with 14 - 3 - 3 YWHA proteins . This interpretation is supported by our interactome proﬁling and systematic functional screening studies , which showed increased interaction of YWHA proteins with YAP in Cav1KO cells and speciﬁc rescue of YAP translocation upon their siRNA depletion . YAP retention in the cytosol upon interac - tion with YWHAH proteins led to deﬁcient YAP transcriptional activity in these cells . Furthermore , YWHAH proteins positively control Yap expression ( Figures S4G and 4F ) , adding a new level of complexity to the control of YAP activity . Our studies also identify several regulators of YAP nuclear translocation , including nuclear pore components and proteins involved in nucleocytosolic transport . Changes in stromal stiffness and architecture can enhance tumor aggressiveness , promote resistance to therapy , and favor metastasis ( Levental et al . , 2009 ) . During tumor progression , CAFs surrounding the tumor may favor an increase in the stiff - ness of the tumor mass . In CAFs , ECM stiffness itself is an acti - vating cue , thus potentially enabling a mechanically driven Figure 4 .

CAV1 expression in CAFs correlates with higher remodeling capacity and facilitates tumor invasion ( Goetz et al . , 2011 ) . Our results provide the ﬁrst evidence of a functional connection between these nodes . 3D assays show that exogenous expression of a constitutively active YAP mutant reverts the impairment of ECM remodeling associated with CAV1 deﬁciency . This proposed CAV1 - YAP regulation is therefore likely a signiﬁcant driver of key events in tumor progression . Pancreatitis is characterized by immune cell inﬁltration , inter - lobular and interacinar edema , and ﬁbrosis and is a major risk factor for the development of pancreatic cancer ( Yadav and Lowenfels , 2013 ) . YAP contributes to acinar cell dedifferentiation in ADM and prevents the regeneration of injured areas ( Gruber et al . , 2016 ; Murakami et al . , 2017 ) .

Cell Reports 25 , 1622 – 1635 , November 6 , 2018 1631 increases stiffening ( Hidalgo , 2012 ) , and the increased tissue stiffness in caerulein - induced acute pancreatitis could explain the differences in YAP activation between WT and Cav1KO mice . Our results thus support an important role for CAV1 - YAP regulation in vivo and suggest a potential link between inﬂamma - tion - induced stiffness and disease progression . These results suggest the interesting possibility that CAV1 - YAP regulation could determine pancreatic cancer progression , since YAP is required for the initial stages of PDAC development ( Gruber et al . , 2016 ) . Our results demonstrate that CAV1 regulates YAP activity , determining the mechanical response to changes in ECM rigidity and other mechanical cues . CAV1 - YAP regulation modulates pathophysiological processes such as ECM remodeling and the response to acute pancreatitis . These ﬁndings suggest that this regulation could determine the onset and progression of different physiological and pathological processes , such as tumor development , through multiple mechanisms .

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS In vivo animal studies Cav1KO C57BL / 6 mice ( Drab et al . , 2001 ) were bred under speciﬁc pathogen - free conditions at the CNIC . Experiments were performed with 8 - 12 - week - old males ( Cav1KO and age - matched control littermates ) . All animal protocols ( PROEX 097 / 18 ) were in accordance with Spanish animal protection law and were authorized by the corresponding local authority . Cell culture MEFs were isolated from WT and Cav1KO littermate mice , immortalized , and cultured as described ( Razani et al . , 2001 ) . Neonatal hepatocytes from WT and Cav1KO littermates were isolated , phenotyped ( Mayoral et al . , 2010 ) , and kindly provided by Dr . Martı´n - Sanz ( IIBM Alberto Sols , Spain ) . The human MDA - MB - 231 breast carcinoma and HeLa cell lines were obtained from ATCC . HeLa cells expressing CAV1 – GFP were kindly provided by Lukas Pelkmans ( ETH , Z € urich , Switzerland ) . MEFs , hepatocytes and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) and MDA - MB231 cells were grown in DMEM / F - 12 ( GIBCO , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc [ Waltham ; Massachusetts , United States ] ) ; growth media were supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; GIBCO , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc and GE Healthcare Life Science HyClone [ Little Chalfont , United Kingdom ] ) and 100 m g / ml penicillin and streptomycin ( GIBCO , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . Primary pancreatic cancer associated ﬁbroblasts ( PanCAF ) were a gift from Manuel Hidalgo ( Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncolo´gicas , Spain ) . PanCAFs were grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium ( RPMI ) supplemented with 20 % FBS , 100 m g / ml penicillin and streptomycin , and 5 % glutamine . All cells were maintained in a humidiﬁed atmosphere at 37 (cid:4) C and 5 % CO2 . METHOD DETAILS Polyacrylamide matrices Polyacrylamide gels with tuneable stiffness were prepared on glass coverslips as previously described ( Tse and Engler , 2010 ) . 3 - ami - nopropyltrimethoxysilane ( Sigma - Aldrich [ St . Louis , Missouri , United States ] ) was applied over the surface of a coverslip using a cot - ton - tipped swab and another coverslip was treated with Sigmacote (cid:2) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . The coverslips were then washed thoroughly with sterilized water and dried . Acrylamide / bis - acrylamide solutions were prepared using appropriate concentrations to obtain stiff matrices ( Young’s modulus (cid:3) 55 KPa ) and soft matrices ( (cid:3) 200 Pa ) as previously deﬁned ( Fischer et al . , 2012 ) . Polymerization initi - ators ( 0 . 05 % w / v ammonium persulfate and 0 . 0005 % v / v N , N , N 0 , N 0 - tetramethylethylenediamine [ TEMED ] , ﬁnal concentrations ) were added to the bis - acrylamide mixture . A drop of this mixture was deposited on top of the silanized glass and covered with the sigmacote - treated coverslip ; 183 m L was deposited for round coverslips ( 40mm diameter ) and 50 m L for square coverslips ( 24x24mm ) . After polymerization , the upper coverslip was removed and the polyacrylamide surface was photo - activated by exposing the sulfo - SANPAH crosslinker ( Sigma - Aldrich ) to UV light . Finally , the surface was coated with ﬁbronectin ( 5 m g / ml ) for 1 h at 37 (cid:4) C . Fibronectin was then removed and cells were seeded at low conﬂuence . Experiments were performed 24h after seeding . Micropatterns Glass slides with pre - printed micropatterns were purchased from Cytoo ( Grenoble , France ) . Designs for customized patterns with speciﬁc grid sizes were described by Dr . Piccolo and colleagues ( Dupont et al . , 2011 ) . Fibronectin coating was performed as spec - iﬁed by the supplier . Cells were plated , and 24 h later , ﬁxed and stained following standard protocols . Cell strain 24h after plating on ﬁbronectin - coated 6 - well plates ( FlexCell [ Burlington , North Carolina , United States ] ) , cells were subjected to uniaxial cyclic stretching ( 0 . 7Hz , 8 % – 9 % amplitude ) for 24h on a programmable Flexcell (cid:2) FX - 5000 TM Tension System ( FlexCell ) under standard culture conditions . Reagents and transfections The ON - TARGET plus SMARTpool siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon ( Table S3 ; Lafayette , Colorado , United States ) , siRNA targeting human CAV1 was custom made ( sense sequence : GAGCUUCCUGAUUGAGAUU . Cells were transfected with siRNAs at 20pmol / 1000 cells using Lipofectamine (cid:2) RNAiMAX ( Invitrogene ; Carlsbad , California , United States ) . Silencing was allowed to proceed for 48h before terminating the experiment . p2xFlag CMV2 - YAP2 was a gift from Dr . Sudol ( Addgene plasmid # 19045 ; Cambridge , Massachusetts , USA ) ( Oka et al . , 2008 ) . pCMV - ﬂag YAP2 5SA ( Addgene plasmid # 27371 ) was a gift from Dr . Guan . 8xGTIIC - luciferase ( Addgene plasmid # 34615 ) was a gift from Dr . Piccolo . The lentiviral backbone for pLVX - CMV - CherryFP - P2A - MetLuc was derived from pLVX _ shRNA2 ( Clontech ; e3 Cell Reports 25 , 1622 – 1635 . e1 – e6 , November 6 , 2018 Mountain View , California , United States ) and was provided by the CNIC Viral Vectors ( VV ) Unit . CMVCherryFPP2A was obtained from pRRL _ CMV _ CherryFP _ P2A ( provided by the CNIC VV Unit and cloned into pLVX ) . The Metridia luciferase ( secretable form ) was ampliﬁed from pMetLuc reporter ( Clontech ; also provided by the CNIC VV Unit ) and cloned in - frame with the CherryFP - P2A pep - tide . pEGFP – mDia1 ( DeltaN3 ) and pcDNA3 - HA - RHO ( V14 ) were as described ( del Pozo et al . , 1999 ; Ishizaki et al . , 2001 ) . All transient transfections were by electroporation with 5 m g plasmid DNA and 35 m g UltraPure salmon sperm DNA solution ( Sigma - Aldrich ) at 350V and 550ohms for 10msec . Drugs were added to cells 3h after plating , followed by incubation for a further 21h . The ROCK inhibitor Y27632 ( Y0503 ) and cytochalasinD ( C8273 ) were from Sigma - Aldrich . Jasplakinolide ( sc - 202191 ) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Dallas , Texas , United States ) . Antibodies Monoclonal antibodies were sourced as follows : anti - YAP ( sc - 101199 ) and anti - TEF - 1 ( sc - 376113 ) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; anti - CAV1 XP ( # 3267 ) and anti - YWHAH ( 14 - 3 - 3 h ( D23B7 ) ; # 5521 ) from Cell Signaling ( Danvers , Massachusetts , United States ) ; anti - Flag M2 ( F - 3167 ) from Sigma - Aldrich ; and anti - glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( MAB374 ) and anti - cortactin ( p80 / 85 , clone 4F11 ) from Millipore ( Burlington , Massachusetts , United States ) . Polyclonal antibodies to phospho - YAP ( Ser127 ) ( # 9411 ) , LATS1 ( # 9153 ) , and LATS2 ( # 13646 ) were from Cell Signaling ; anti - Histone H3 ( ab1791 ) was from Abcam ( Cambridge , United Kingdom ) ; and anti - RHO GDI ( sc - 360 ) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology . For immunohistochemistry , we used anti - YAP ( D8H1X ) XP from Cell Signaling ( # 14074 ) and a SMA from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ( RB - 9010 - P0 ) . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy For immunoﬂuorescence procedures , cells were ﬁxed in paraformaldehyde 4 % ( w / v ) at 37 (cid:4) C for 10 minutes , permeabilized , blocked with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in BSA 1 % ( w / v ) for 10 min , and then immunostained with speciﬁc antibodies for 1h . Alexa647 phalloidin and Alexa546 - and Alexa488 - labeled secondary antibodies were from Invitrogen . Images were acquired either on a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope or an Opera automated confocal microscope ( PerkinElmer ; Waltham , Massachusetts , United States ) . Subcellular fractionation For subcellular fractionation the cells were lysed ( 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 6 , 10 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride , protease inhibitor cocktail [ Roche ] , and 0 . 05 % NP - 40 ) . Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated by centrifugation . The cytosolic fraction was precipitated with acetone and nuclei were lysed ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 6 , 0 . 4 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 75 mM spermidine , 0 . 15mM spermine , 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride , and protease inhibitor cocktail [ Roche ] ) and centrifuged at 13000 rpm to remove the DNA . Both fractions were eluted with sample buffer and analyzed by western blotting . Immunoprecipitation For immunoprecipitation , cells were lysed ( 50mM Tris - HCl at pH8 , 100mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 [ Sigma - Aldrich ] , 10 % glycerol , 1mMMgCl2 , 2mM PMSF , protease inhibitor cocktail [ Roche ] ) . Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 (cid:4) C . Supernatants were mixed with the speciﬁc antibody or control IgG for 2h , and protein G – agarose beads were added for a further 2h . Beads were washed with washing buffer ( 50mM Tris - HCl pH7 . 5 , 150mM NaCl , 1mM EDTA , 0 . 25 % gelatin , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 [ Sigma - Aldrich ] ) and processed for mass spectrometry or western blotting . Immunoblotting For western blotting , immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with sample buffer and analyzed by western blotting on nitrocellulose membranes ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , UK ) with primary and secondary HRP - conjugated antibodies using standard protocols . Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amersham Life Sciences ; Arlington Hts , Illinois , United States ) . Nuclear and cytosolic subcellular fractions were prepared as described ( Navarro - Le´rida et al . , 2015 ) . Image analysis YAP subcellular distribution was analyzed with the Columbus Image Data Storage and Analysis System ( Perkin Elmer ) or imageJ . Nuclei were segmented using the Hoechst signal ( Figure S4B ) . Mitotic and aberrant nuclei were then eliminated based on Hoechst intensity and nuclear roundness and area . Cells located at the image borders were also eliminated . The cytosol was segmented growing the nuclear segmentation ( Figure S4C ) . The cytosolic ROI for cytosolic YAP intensity calculation was built as a 4 pixel ring of cytoplasm grown radially from the segmented nuclear border ( Figure S4C ) . Finally , the ratio between nuclear and cytosolic YAP was calculated . Second harmonic generation ( SHG ) imaging Fibrillary collagen in non - ﬁxed cell - embedded collagen gels was imaged using the SHG technique ( Chen et al . , 2012 ) with a Zeiss LSM780 multiphoton microscope ( Carl Zeiss Microscopy ; Jena , Germany ) ﬁtted with a short pulse laser . Cell Reports 25 , 1622 – 1635 . e1 – e6 , November 6 , 2018 e4 Luciferase assay Luciferase assays to monitor TEAD transcriptional activity with the 8xGTIIC - luciferase reporter were as described ( Mahoney et al . , 2005 ) . Cells were transiently co - transfected with 8xGTIIC - luciferase ( product : ﬁreﬂy luciferase ) and pLVX - CMV - CherryFP - P2A - MetLuc ( product : Metridia luciferase [ MelLuc ] , which is secreted to the medium ) . Luciferase activity was monitored with the Dual - Luciferase (cid:2) Reporter Assay System ( Promega ; Madison , Wisconsin , United States ) in an ORION II microplate luminometer ( Titertek Berthold ; Bad Wildbad , Germany ) . Fireﬂy luciferase was quantiﬁed in cell lysates by adding Luciferase Assay Reagent II ( LARII ) , and MetLuc was quantiﬁed in culture medium by adding Stop & Glo reagent . Fireﬂy luciferase activity was normalized to MetLuc activity to control for variability in transfection efﬁciency across samples . Collagen contraction assay Contraction assays to monitor matrix remodeling were as described ( Goetz et al . , 2011 ; Orimo et al . , 2005 ) . Brieﬂy , 1 . 5 3 10 5 MEFs were included in a collagen type I gel ( PureCol , Sigma - Aldrich ; 1 . 5mg / ml , 500 m L total volume ) in an Ultra - Low Attachment 24 - well plate ( Corning ; Corning , New York , United States ) . After gel polymerization , normal culture medium was added , and collagen gel bor - ders were detached from the border of the plate . Gels were cultured at 37 (cid:4) C , 5 % CO 2 for 48h . Gel contraction was monitored by quantifying the gel surface area on photographs with ImageJ . The fold - change with respect to the contraction observed in a control condition was calculated for each sample . Acute pancreatitis induction Acute pancreatitis was induced by caerulein treatment as described ( Guerra et al . , 2007 ) . Before the experiment , mice were starved for 12h with unrestricted access to drinking water . Acute pancreatitis was induced by 7 intraperitoneal injections of caerulein ( Sigma - Aldrich ) dissolved in PBS ; injections were given at 1 - h intervals on 2 consecutivedays at a dose of 50 m g caerulein / kg body weight per injection . Control animals received injections of PBS only . At deﬁned intervals , animals were sacriﬁced and the pancreas excised for immunohistochemical analysis . Immunostained preparations were scanned with Hamamatsu Nanozoomer 2 . 0 RS ( Hamamatsu , Japan ) and digitized with NDP . scan 2 . 5 . Images were viewed and quantiﬁed with NDP . analyzer and NDP . view2 ( Hamamatsu ; Hamamatsu City , Japan ) . Real - time quantitative PCR RNA was extracted from cell samples with the RNAeasy micro kit ( QIAGEN ; Hilden , Germany ) . For each sample , 1 m g RNA was reverse transcribed using the Omniscript RT kit ( QIAGEN ) and random primers ( Promega ) . qPCR was performed with SYBR green ( Applied Biosystems ; Foster City , California , USA ) Appropriate negative and positive controls were used ( Hellemans et al . , 2007 ) . Results were normalized to endogenous GAPDH and HPRT1 expression using qBase plus . Primer sequences were summarized in Table S4 . RNA - Seq analysis Next generation sequencing experiments were performed at the CNIC Genomics Unit . Total RNA was extracted as for qRT - PCR ( see above ) . RNA integrity was determined with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies ; Santa Clara , California , United States ) . Two RNA samples per condition were analyzed by single read ( SR ) sequencing in an Illumina HiSeq 2500 System ( Illumina ; San Diego , California , United States ) . Data were analyzed in the CNIC Bioinformatics Unit . Enrichment analysis was conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software ( IPA , QIAGEN ) and the Enrichr web tool . Actin ﬁber organization analysis Actin ﬁber organization was imaged and quantiﬁed in MATLAB ( R2015a ) and ImageJ ( 1 . 51a x64 ) . Fiber order / parallelism in a ROI was measured with a custom multiscale anisotropy analysis script based on the FibrilTool plug - in for ImageJ ( Boudaoud et al . , 2014 ) ; this tool analyzes the structural information embodied by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a nematic tensor . Iterative performance of this analysis in a collection of image patches of different sizes gives information about the organization of structures at multiple scales and locations . The anisotropy value of each pixel in the original image is set to the mean anisotropy score obtained for each processed patch containing the pixel . The patch collection is created by dividing the image into NxN nonoverlapping subimages , with N ˛ f 2 i j i = 0 ; 1 ; 2 . g W f 3 i j i = 0 ; 1 ; 2 . g deﬁning each iteration . The ﬁnal multiscale anisotropy score is the mean of all the anisot - ropy values of the pixels in the image . This measurement can be constrained to a speciﬁc area of interest by using only speciﬁc pixels determined by prior segmentation , a useful way of avoiding interference from background or other structures that could bias the results . In micropattern experiments , the inputs were cropped images of the cytoplasmic area of cells ( 241x261 pixels ) , avoiding background and membranes as much as possible ; no prior area restriction was deﬁned , and the minimum size of patches was ﬁxed at 10x10 pixels . Mass spectrometry analysis Protein G – agarose beads bound to immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated at room temperature for 2h in a 60 m L volume of 2 M urea , 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 5 , and 10 mM TCEP with gentle vortexing . Iodoacetamide ( 7 m L , 500 mM ) was then added and the incu - bation continued in the dark . After dilution to 0 . 5 M urea with ammonium bicarbonate , 3 m g of trypsin were added and samples were e5 Cell Reports 25 , 1622 – 1635 . e1 – e6 , November 6 , 2018 incubated for 6 - 8 h at 37 (cid:4) C . Samples were then acidiﬁed to 1 % TFA , and the supernatants were desalted on C18 minispin columns ( The Nest Group ; Southborough , MA , USA ) and dried down for further analysis . Experiments were performed with 5 independent replicates . Peptides were analyzed by LC - MS / MS using a C - 18 reversed phase nano - column ( 75 m m I . D . x 50 cm , 2 m m particle size , Acclaim PepMap RSLC , 100 C18 ; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) in a continuous acetonitrile gradient consisting of 0 % – 32 % B over 80 min , 50 % – 90 % B over 3 min at 50 (cid:4) C ( A = 0 . 1 % formic acid ; B = 80 % acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % formic acid ) . Peptides were eluted from the nanocolumn at a ﬂow rate of 200 nL / min to an emitter nanospray needle for real - time ionization and peptide fragmentation in a QExactive HF mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . The chromatographic run analyzed an enhanced FT - resolution spectrum ( 70 , 000 resolution ) followed by the MS / MS spectra from the 15 most intense parent ions . Dynamic exclusion was set at 40 s . For peptide identiﬁcation , all spectra were analyzed with Proteome Discoverer ( version 2 . 1 . 0 . 81 , Thermo Fisher Sci - entiﬁc ) using SEQUEST - HT ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . For searching the Uniprot proteome database containing all sequences from mouse and frequently observed contaminants ( April 27 , 2016 ; 48644 entries ) , the following parameters were selected : trypsin digestion with 2 maximum missed cleavage sites ; precursor and fragment mass tolerances of 2 Da and 0 . 02 Da , respectively ; car - bamidomethyl cysteine as a ﬁxed modiﬁcation ; and methionine oxidation as a dynamic modiﬁcation . Peptides were identiﬁed by the probability ratio method ( Martı´nez - Bartolome´ et al . , 2008 ) , and false discovery rate ( FDR ) was calculated using inverted databases and the reﬁned method ( Navarro and Va´zquez , 2009 ) with an additional ﬁltering for a precursor mass tolerance of 15 ppm ( Bonzon - Kulichenko et al . , 2015 ) . Proteins were quantiﬁed for each condition based on the number of scans / peptides identiﬁed at 1 % FDR . Image - based siRNA screening The smart - pool siRNA library for selected YAP interactors detected by mass spectrometry was purchased from Dharmacon . Four different sequences per each gene were used . SiRNAs were transfected by reverse transfection in 384 - well plates . Cells were ﬁxed and stained for YAP detection 48h post transfection as described previously . Immunoﬂuorescence images were acquired with an Opera automated confocal microscope ( PerkinElmer ) . Three replicates were performed , with four wells per siRNA in each replicate . Two different ON - traget nontargeting siRNA controls were used . Transfection efﬁciency was validated by transfection with INCENP siRNA , which promotes the appearance of multinucleated cells and cells with aberrant nuclei ( Figure S4A ) . YAP nucleo : cytosolic ra - tios were calculated using Columbus as described above ( Image analysis section ) , and Z - scores were calculated as Z = ( x – control mean ) / control standard deviation . The mean Z - score of the three replicates was calculated . SEEK analysis SEEK ( http : / / seek . princeton . edu ) is a computational coexpression gene search tool ( Zhu et al . , 2015 ) . We queried this web tool with the list of previously published YAP target genes ( Dupont et al . , 2011 ) and used all human expression datasets from tissue samples and cell lines included in SEEK for coexpression analysis . The program gives a ranked list of genes ordered from the strongest pos - itive correlation with the query to the weakest . With Enrichr ( Chen et al . , 2013 ; Kuleshov et al . , 2016 ) , we analyzed the enrichment in KEGG annotated pathways and gene ontology ( GO ) terms of the 200 genes showing the highest positive coexpression with YAP targets . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Statistical details of experiments are reported in Figure Legends . Signiﬁcance was evaluated by paired Student’s t test , using GraphPad Prism . Differences were considered statistically signiﬁcant at * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 005 , and * * * * p < 0 . 0005 . YAP - target gene enrichment on stiff versus soft substrates in the RNA - Seq analysis was compared by the Fisher exact test using an online Fisher exact test calculator ( http : / / www . socscistatistics . com / tests / ﬁsher / Default2 . aspx ) .
