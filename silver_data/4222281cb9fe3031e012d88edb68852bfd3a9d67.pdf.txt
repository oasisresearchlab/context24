The posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) is thought to have a function in the sensorimotor transformations that underlie visually guided reaching , as damage to the PPC can result in difﬁculty reaching to visual targets in the absence of speciﬁc visual or motor deﬁcits 1 . This function is supported by ﬁndings that PPC neurons in monkeys are modulated by the direction of hand movement , as well as by visual , eye position and limb position signals 2 – 9 . The PPC could transform visual target locations from retinal coordinates to hand - centred coordinates by combining sensory signals in a serial manner to yield a body - centred representation of target location 10 – 12 , and then subtracting the body - centred location of the hand . We report here that in dorsal area 5 of the PPC , remembered target locations are coded with respect to both the eye and hand . This suggests that the PPC transforms target locations directly between these two reference frames . Data obtained in the adjacent parietal reach region ( PRR ) indicate that this transformation may be achieved by vectorially subtracting hand location from target location , with both locations represented in eye - centred coordinates . The problem that we address here is shown in Fig . 1a . Although the execution of movement requires the speciﬁcation of a detailed pattern of inputs to the muscles , movement planning is believed to involve the computation of higher level movement parameters , such as the direction and / or distance that the hand must move to reach the target ( vector M ) 10 . This is due to the fact that movement goals , as well as evidence of our success in achieving these goals , are largely expressed in high level terms , that is , as visually perceived discre - pancies between the position of the hand and target or deviations from a desired path 13 . Hereafter we use the term ‘target position in hand coordinates’ to describe vector M in Fig . 1a , although the terms ‘movement vector’ and ‘motor error’ could also be used . This information could be derived by subtracting the sensed location of the hand ( vector H ) from the sensed location of the target ( vector T ) , as long as hand position and target position are coded in a common frame of reference . However , although target position appears to be coded in eye - centred ( retinal ) coordinates in the early stages of reach planning 14 , hand position is derived from both visual and proprioceptive signals , and can conceivably be coded in eye - centred coordinates , body centred coordinates ( that is , with respect to the torso ) , or both . It is unclear therefore whether the operation shown in Fig . 1a is achieved by subtracting the position of the hand from the position of the target directly , using eye - centred coordi - nates ( Fig . 1a , b ) , or by transforming target locations from eye - to head - to body - centred coordinates , and then subtracting the body - centred position of the hand 10 , 11 ( Fig . 1c ) . We have approached this problem by analysing the reach - related activity of neurons in the PPC , while varying target position , hand position and gaze direction . Single cell recordings were obtained from area 5 ( Fig . 2a , b ) , a subdivision of the PPC that projects directly to cortical and subcortical motor structures 15 – 17 . In an initial experiment , 89 neurons from two monkeys were studied under four experimental conditions ( Fig . 2c ) . In two conditions , gaze was held constant at the centre position of a vertically oriented * Present address : Howard Hughes Medical Institute , and Department of Neurobiology , StanfordUniversitySchoolofMedicine , FairchildBuilding , RoomD209 , Stanford , California94305 , USA letters to nature NATURE | VOL 416 | 11 APRIL 2002 | www . nature . com 632 © 2002 Macmillan Magazines Ltd board of push buttons , and initial hand location was varied to the left ( condition 1 ) or right ( condition 2 ) of this centre position . In the other two conditions , initial hand location was located at the centre position and gaze was varied either to the left ( condition 3 ) or right ( condition 4 ) of centre . Across the four conditions , mean ﬁring rate varied least when target locations were identical in both hand and eye coordinates . For example , the activity of the neuron in Fig . 2 varied substantially between conditions 1 and 2 , when target locations were identical in hand coordinates but different in both body coordinates ( with respect to the torso ) and eye coordinates ( with respect to the ﬁxation point ) . The activity of this neuron also varied substantially between conditions 3 and 4 , when target locations were identical in hand and body coordinates but different in eye coordinates . However , activity was very similar between conditions 1 and 4 and between conditions 2 and 3 , when target locations were identical in both hand and eye coordinates . This point is shown more generally in Fig . 3a – e . In each scatterplot , individual data points correspond to the mean ﬁring rate of a single cell for two movements to the same target location in hand , body , eye , body and hand , or eye and hand coordinates ( panels a – e , respectively ) . Data from all cells and all possible target locations are shown . The scatter in each plot illustrates how well that particular coordinate frame or frames accounted for area 5 neuronal population activity . A low degree of scatter ( that is , a high degree of correlation ) indicates a good ﬁt to the data , whereas a high degree of scatter ( low correlation ) indicates a poor ﬁt . Statistical analyses of the data in Fig . 3 revealed that area 5 activity was best correlated when target locations were identical in both eye and hand coordi - nates ( Kruskal – Wallis test with nonparametric multiple compari - sons , P , 0 . 05 ) . Although the data in Fig . 3 could by explained by the presence of two populations of neurons , one coding in eye coordinates and the other in hand coordinates , Fig . 4 shows that the responses of neurons in area 5 are more consistent with a single population coding target location in both reference frames . Figure 4a – d shows the responses of an idealized neuron coding target location in eye coordinates ( panels a , b ) , both eye and hand coordinates ( panel c ) or hand coordinates ( panel d ) . Figure 4a shows that if target locations are coded purely in eye coordinates , tuning curves for target location in eye coordinates will not shift when initial hand location in eye coordinates is varied , although they will modulate in amplitude if initial hand location in eye coordinates is explicitly coded , as in Fig . 4b . Figure 4d shows that if target locations are coded purely in hand coordinates , tuning curves will shift com - pletely with initial hand location .

The position of the cup is initially represented in the brain in terms of its location on the peripheral retina ( T ) . To reach for the cup , its position with respect to the hand must be known ( M ) . This information could be acquired by directly subtracting hand position ( H ) from target position ( T ) in eye coordinates ( a , b ) , or by gradually transforming the position of the target from eye - to body - centred coordinates , and subtracting the body - centred position of the hand ( c ) .

Figure 4e shows for area 5 ( N (cid:136) 89 ) the distribution of tuning curve shifts when target locations in eye coordinates were the same and initial hand location was varied from left to right by 36 8 . This distribution has a single large peak at 18 8 ( standard error ^ 3 ) , corresponding to a partial shift and consistent with a simultaneous coding of target location in both eye and hand coordinates . For comparison , Fig . 4e shows the same analysis applied to the PRR data ( N (cid:136) 98 ) of ref . 14 . This distribution has a large peak at 0 8 , corresponding to no shift and consistent with a purely eye - centred coding of target location . To explore further the hypothesis that neurons in area 5 code target location in both eye and hand coordinates , we trained one monkey to reach to a row of ﬁve targets from each of ﬁve starting locations , while maintaining ﬁxation at a single board location ( one position to the right of centre , see Fig . 5a ) . This designwas chosen so that responses of area 5 neurons could be compared directly with the responses predicted by the different coding models in Fig . 4 . Figure 5b shows a contour plot of data obtained from one area 5 neuron in this experiment . These contours have a largely oblique orientation , similar to those of the idealized neuron in Fig . 4c . To facilitate comparisons between real response ﬁelds and their ideal - ized counterparts , we summarized the trends giving rise to such contours by calculating the gradient of each response ﬁeld and taking its resultant ( see Methods for deﬁnition ) . The vector ﬁeld superimposed on the contour plot in Fig . 5b shows the gradient that was obtained for this neuron . The resultant of the gradient in Fig . 5b is shown in Fig . 5c ( blue vector ) along with a ‘population resultant’ derived from 15 area 5 neurons ( black vector ) , and the gradient resultant obtained for the idealized neuron in Fig . 4c ( red vector ) .

For comparison , Fig . 5d , e shows data obtained from PRR in the same experiment . The contours in Fig . 5d appear most similar to the idealized neuron in Fig . 4b , that is , they appear consistent with a coding of target location and initial hand location in eye coordi - nates . The gradient resultant for this neuron is shown in Fig . 5e ( blue vector ) , along with a population resultant derived from 17 PRR neurons ( black vector ) and the resultant obtained for the idealized neuron in Fig . 4b ( red vector ) . All three resultants point largely to the right in Fig . 5e , consistent with a coding of target location in eye coordinates . The present results indicate that remembered target locations are coded in both eye and hand coordinates in area 5 . These results are not unique to the perireach epoch — similar results were obtained when activity occurring immediately after presentation of the target , as well as during the delay period , was analysed separately . Thus , reaching to remembered target locations seems to entail a direct transformation from eye - centred to hand - centred coordi - nates , although more indirect schemes ( for example , Fig . 1c ) may still operate in other contexts 18 . The responses of neurons in the PRR suggest a mechanism for this direct transformation . Although PRR neurons strongly code target location in eye coordinates , some cells are ‘gain modulated’ 19 by initial hand location ( for example , see Fig . 5d ) , which is also coded in eye coordinates in this area 20 . If both target location and initial hand location are coded in eye coordi - nates in the PPC , then they can simply be subtracted to compute the target’s location in hand coordinates , as shown in Fig . 1a , b . A role for the PPC in the comparison of target and hand position - related signals has been previously suggested 21 , 22 , although the coordinate frame underlying this operation has not been speciﬁed until now . Simulations have shown that this operation can be implemented neurally by a simple , weighted summation of gain - modulated neurons like those found in the PRR ( Fig . 5d ) 23 . The fact that target locations are coded in both eye and hand coordinates in area 5 might mean that further processing is needed to complete the transformation to hand coordinates . However , it is also quite possible that this spatial representation is necessary for the functions performed by this cortical area , and therefore does not signify an intermediate step in the transformation process 24 . Con - sistent with this latter possibility are the ﬁndings that area 5 receives visual , proprioceptive , and efference copy signals 2 – 9 , which are probably represented in different coordinate frames 25 . In principle , the gain - modulated cells in the PRR can be used to compute target locations purely in hand - centred coordinates , that is , without an eye - centred component , by weighting the convergence of activity differently . Such a scheme may be used to construct representations in other brain areas that are more heavily biased towards hand - centred coordinates than the one observed in area 5 . A Methods Behavioural paradigm and neurophysiological recordings Reaches weremade to touch sensitivebuttons that were3 . 7cm indiameter andset 7 . 5cm apart , within a board placed 24cm from the monkeys . In each condition , reaches were typically made to between 8 and 11 buttons located immediately surrounding the initial hand position and / or within an adjacent column of buttons ( Fig . 2 ) . Each button contained both a red and a green light - emitting diode ( LED ) . The red LED instructed the animals where to direct and maintain their gaze , whereas the green LED instructed the animalswheretoplacetheirhand . Alltrialsbeganwiththeilluminationofbotharedanda green LED . A green ( target ) LED at another locationwas then brieﬂy illuminated ( 300ms duration ) . After a delay period of 600 – 1 , 000 ms , the LEDs instructing the initial hand location and ﬁxation point were turned off and the animal reached to the remembered location of the target in complete darkness while maintaining ﬁxation . Eye position was monitored using the scleral search coil technique . Reaching movements were made with the contralateral ( left ) arm . Weobtainedrecordingsfromtherighthemispheresoftwomonkeys ( Macacamulatta ) . Eighty - nine area 5 neurons ( 61 from the animal CKYand 28 from animal DNT ) were studied in all fourconditions of the initial experiment . Furthermore , we studied 15 area 5 neurons and 17 PRR neurons ( all from animal CKY ) in the second experiment . The approximate centre of the PRR recording sites in this second experiment was 5 - mm posterior tothecentreofthearea5sites , atdepthsbelowthesuperﬁcialcortex . Thesesites representonlyaportionofthelargerreach - relatedregionreportedinanearlierstudy 26 . All analyses were performed on the mean ﬁring rate ( 5 repetitions ) during a 400 - ms epoch centred on movement onset . Correlation analysis Determinationofstatisticaldifferencesamongcorrelationswasfacilitatedbyconstructingadistributionofcorrelationcoefﬁcients ( N (cid:136) 200 ) for each coordinate frame ( s ) , using standardstatisticalbootstrappingtechniques 27 . AKruskal – Wallistestwithnonparametric multiple comparisons ( P , 0 . 05 ) was then performed on these distributions 28 , which revealedthatarea5activitywasbestcorrelatedwhentargetlocationswereidenticalinbotheyeandhandcoordinates ( Fig . 3e ) . At the population level , activity was generally well correlated in all reference frames , due in part to the fact that area 5 neurons exhibit relatively broad spatial tuning as well as the fact that cells with low ﬁring rates tended to ﬁre at low rates in all experimental conditions . Toassessthedegreetowhichourﬁndingsdependedontherelativenumberof low ﬁring pairs in Fig . 3a – e , we performed an additional analysis of the scatter in these plots , using ameasurethat isrelatively insensitiveto differing numbers oflow - ﬁringpairs and data points ( which varied across Fig . 3a – e ) . More speciﬁcally , scatter ( s ) was quantiﬁed as s (cid:136) X n i (cid:136) 1 r 2 i (cid:30)X n i (cid:136) 1 r 2 i (cid:133) 1 (cid:134) where r is the perpendicular distance to the unity line , and r is the distance to the origin . This analysis gave the same result as that which was obtained using the correlation coefﬁcient , that is , scatter was least when target locations were identical in both eye and hand coordinates ( Kruskal – Wallis test with nonparametric multiple comparisons , P , 0 . 05 ) .

Gradient analysis We estimated gradients from the data using an approximate numerical method ( Matlab ; Mathworks ) . The gradient resultant is a measure of the ‘orientation’ of an individual response ﬁeld , and hence is an indicator of the variable or variables to which a neuron is most responsive ( target position , initial hand position , and so on ) , regardless of the form of tuning ( gaussian , sigmoid , and so on ) .

The inability of axons to regenerate after a spinal cord injury in the adult mammalian central nervous system ( CNS ) can lead to permanent paralysis . At sites of CNS injury , a glial scar develops , containing extracellular matrix molecules including chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans ( CSPGs ) 1 , 2 . CSPGs are inhibitory to axon growth in vitro 3 – 5 , and regenerating axons stop at CSPG - rich regions in vivo 6 . Removing CSPG glycosaminoglycan ( GAG ) chains attenuates CSPG inhibitory activity 7 – 10 . To test the func - tional effects of degrading chondroitin sulphate ( CS ) - GAG after spinal cord injury , we delivered chondroitinase ABC ( ChABC ) to the lesioned dorsal columns of adult rats . We show that intra - thecal treatment with ChABC degraded CS - GAG at the injury site , upregulated a regeneration - associated protein in injured neurons , and promoted regeneration of both ascending sensory projections and descending corticospinal tract axons . ChABC treatment also restored post - synaptic activity below the lesion after electrical stimulation of corticospinal neurons , and pro - moted functional recovery of locomotor and proprioceptive behaviours . Our results demonstrate that CSPGs are important § Presentaddress : MiamiProjecttoCureParalysis , 1095NW14thTerrace , POBox16960 , MailLocator R - 48 , Miami , Florida 33101 , USA . letters to nature NATURE | VOL 416 | 11 APRIL 2002 | www . nature . com 636 © 2002 Macmillan Magazines Ltd
