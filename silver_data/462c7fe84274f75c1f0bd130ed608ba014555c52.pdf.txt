David A . King The ability to judge a nation’s scientific standing is vital for the governments , busi - nesses and trusts that must decide scientific priorities and funding . In this paper I analyse the output and outcomes from research investment over the past decade , to measure the quality of research on national scales and to set it in an international con - text . There are many ways to evaluate the quality of scientific research , but few have proved satisfactory . My analysis updates and extends the groundbreaking work by May 1 , which covered 1981 – 94 , and draws on a study of 1993 – 2002 commissioned by the UK Office of Science and Technology ( OST ) 2 . Although the OST study’s admit - tedly parochial objective is to evaluate the United Kingdom’s performance in science and engineering research , this paper should be of more widespread interest as it pro - vides metrics for judging achievement , and analyses of the output and outcomes of other countries . To measure the quantity and quality of science in different nations , I have analysed the numbers of published research papers and reviews , and their citations . All data were provided by Thomson ISI , previously known as the Institute for Scientific Information , which indexes more than 8 , 000 journals in 36 languages , representing most significant material in science and engineering . One potential problem with this type of bibliometric analysis is that individual papers can skew the results . For instance , a paper may be highly cited because it has been discredited , or because its authors over - cite their own work . However , the large number of papers in this study should smooth out such distortions . The heads of large research institutions may also be authors on papers to which their contribution was largely indirect . However , my analysis considers only authors’country of origin , that is where they are working , rather than individual names . Finally , citation analyses must not be used to compare different disciplines . For example , papers in medical research get many more citations than those in mathe - matics . An aggregate ofcitations across disci - plines will therefore lead to high - citation disciplines swamping the low , an issue I will consider later . I made comparisons across 31 countries ( the comparator group ) including the G8 group ( italicized ) and the 15 countries of the European Union before the 2004 acces - sion ( EU15 ) . The countries are : Australia , Austria , Belgium , Brazil , Canada , China , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , India , Iran , Ireland , Israel , Italy , Japan , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Poland , Portugal , Russia , Singapore , Spain , South Africa , South Korea , Sweden , Switzer - land , Taiwan , the United Kingdom and the United States . This group accounted for more than 98 % of the world’s highly cited papers , defined by Thomson ISI as the most cited 1 % by field and year ofpublication . The world’s remaining 162 countries con - tributed less than 2 % in total . The premier league Table 1 shows the total publications and the citation analyses for the comparator group , covering all fields of science and engineer - ing . Each cited paper is allocated once to every country in which an author is based , so some papers are counted twice or more . The sum of national publications exceeds the world total because of international collaboration . National shares similarly sum to more than 100 % . The totals for grouped publications ( EU15 , world ) are adjusted to take this into account , by removing dupli - cate papers with multiple national author - ship , giving an accurate net total . The rank order in Table 1 is only margin - ally affected by the variable selected and is similar to that for 1981 – 94 ( ref . 1 ) . It is not particularly sensitive to which of the two citation analyses are used . The percentage share of world citations ( citations share index ) is the national share of citations in all disciplines , and so gives more weighting to the more heavily cited disciplines , such as medicine . The United States easily heads the list of nations in the volume of publica - tions and citations and the share of top 1 % cited papers , although the EU15 countries now publish more papers than the United States ( Fig . 1 ) and are not far behind on cita - tions . The United Kingdom is second on the two citations listings , but Japan publishes feature NATURE | VOL 430 | 15 JULY 2004 | www . nature . com / nature 311 almost as many papers and Germany is clos - ing the gap in citations . The United States’ share of citations dropped by about 3 % between 1993 and 2002 , whereas the United Kingdom’s and Germany’s have each increased . The cor - rected UK share was 10 . 87 % in 1993 – 97 , 11 . 39 % in 1997 – 2001 and 11 . 6 % in 2001 . The nations with the most citations are pulling away from the rest of the world . The G8 countries are in this premier division , apart from Russia , which has seen a radical drop in science investment since the break - up ofthe Soviet Union . The smaller northern European countries are snapping at the top seven’s heels , and would be in this premier division if combined . Although national contribution to world science is clearly an important indicator , it is also useful to compare outputs and out - comes relative to population and gross domestic product ( GDP ) . Figure 2 compares ‘wealth intensity’ , or GDP per person , with ‘citation intensity’— citations per unit GDP . The smaller nations in the group — the Scandinavian countries , Israel , the Nether - lands and Switzerland — all perform strongly by this measure , with the latter in a significant lead . The nations with a wealth intensity between US $ 20 , 600 ( Spain ) and US $ 35 , 800 ( the United States ) per person cover a nearly tenfold spread in citation intensity , with little correlation in this range . Among the outliers from the G8 are the United States and Japan , both below the average citation intensity for the full com - parator group , and the United Kingdom , which is above average . At the other end of the scale , although the GDPs of China and India place them , respectively , second and fourth in the world , each has a low wealth and citation intensity . The number of citations per paper is a useful measure of the impact of a nation’s output . The data can be re - based , to avoid distortions due to different citation rates in The scientific impact of nations What different countries get for their research spending . Figure 1 Comparing Europe with the United States . Ratio of the publications and citations of the 15 European Union countries in the comparator group ( EU15 ) to the United States on ISI databases in 1993 – 2002 . The EU15 total contains some duplication because of papers jointly authored between countries in the EU group . Counts for papers and citations are totals for country ( or group ) for the stated year .

The figure obtained is the re - based impact ( RBI ) . Table 2 shows the average RBI over all disciplines among the 31 nations for 1993 – 2002 , and also , to demonstrate the trend , the figure for 2002 . Of the G8 nations , the United States heads this table , but once again the gap between the United States , the United Kingdom and Germany has narrowed significantly over the study period . As the US RBI shows a small increase over this period , its drop in citation share ( Table 1 ) is due to a smaller number of published papers , with a higher average quality . It is unlikely that these results reflect an anglophone bias , as it is now accepted that all high - quality papers are published in Eng - lish . But anecdotal evidence suggests that preferential US citing of US papers may distort the analyses , given the sheer size ofthe US contribution . It is possible that Japan and Russia , being more scientifically isolated than the other major players , suffer particu - larly in this respect . Dividing disciplines Governments also need an indication of disciplinary strengths and weaknesses based on international comparisons . Comparing one discipline across different countries should be easier than comparing two disci - plines within one country . There is a variety of ways to categorize disciplines . The Organisation for Economic Co - operation and Development ( OECD ) database uses five broad groups : medical sciences ; natural sciences ; agricultural sci - ences ; engineering and technology ; and social sciences . In the United Kingdom , the assessment performed to determine public research funding is based on 68 disciplinary units . A bibliometric analysis 3 ofseven coun - tries by Adams , including England but not the United Kingdom , based on these units for 1988 – 96 grouped the 68 units into blocks . Finally , the OST’s grant from the UK treasury is divided mainly among seven research councils , each run at arm’s length from government . Taking all ofthese maps into account , and also noting similarities of journal usage by UK researchers from within the 68 discipli - nary units , our contractors based their analysis 2 on seven categories : clinical medicine ; preclinical medicine and health ; biological sciences ; environment ; mathe - matics ; physical sciences ; and engineering . This national and disciplinary disaggre - gation process produces a substantial data - base 2 , but it can be presented in a compressed form using footprint plots ( also known as spider or radial plots ) . The citation share for each category gives a measure of research impact . The aggregated citation share for each nation is shown for comparison . The larger the national footprint , the bigger the impact on international science .

For papers published 1997 – 2001 , the total number of citations to the year 2002 is also included but , given the shorter time period , fewer citations will have accumulated . The main source of internationally comparable data on research funding , staff and training is the OECD ( see ‘statistics’ at http : / / www . sourceoecd . org / content / html / index . htm ) . Data also come from the 2002 editions of the Main Science and Technology Indicators and Basic Science and Technology Statistics . Accuracy and reliability are discussed in ref . 2 .

The US citation share is about treble that of the United Kingdom , and is therefore compared separately on a different scale ( Fig . 4 ) , with the sum of the disciplinary footprints of the EU15 and the United Kingdom . Figure 3 reveals some marked asymme - tries . Russia is relatively strong in the physical sciences and engineering , and weak in the life sciences ; Japan shows strengths in the physical sciences and engineering ; France is strong in mathematics ; Germany has the highest impact in the physical sciences ; and the United Kingdom has the highest impact in this group in the medical , life and environ - mental sciences and is highly placed in math - ematics , but does not show as strongly in the physical sciences and engineering . The com - parison of the United States and the EU15 ( Fig . 4 ) shows that the United States still has a bigger disciplinary footprint than the EU15 , largely owing to its strength in the life sci - ences . The EU15 footprint is more symmet - rical , being a little stronger than the United States in the physical sciences and engineer - ing , but weaker in life and medical sciences . Bang for the buck May’s 1997 analysis 1 included an evaluation of scientific output relative to government money spent on research and development ( R & D ) , excluding defence ; this analysis particularly gave rise to comment and discussion 4 – 6 . The following categories are the key fac - tors in this analysis : higher education R & D , the output of which is people with research degrees and publications ; government R & D , which generally gets more government money than higher education ; publicly funded R & D , the sum of government and higher education ; business funding ofhigher education R & D ; and the gross domestic expenditure on R & D . It is important to recognize that there are lags between changes in research funding and outputs ( publications ) , and between outputs and their impact , and that multivariate models may be necessary to understand productivity . And there are international spillovers : raising one coun - try’s expenditure may increase output in other countries as well , particularly where direct collaboration occurs . Figure 5 gathers data for the G8 nations , excepting Russia , into superimposed foot - prints . Relative strengths and weaknesses appear as asymmetries . The French and German footprints are symmetric and close to the average for this group . Other foot - prints show marked asymmetry . There is a much closer bunching of data points on the input side . The United Kingdom comes fourth on public R & D funding , close to the United States , and at sixth position on the higher - education measure , but first on all three normalized measures of output and outcome . Conversely , Japan is third on the public - funding measure , and first on higher feature NATURE | VOL 430 | 15 JULY 2004 | www . nature . com / nature 313 education , but seventh on all output and outcome indicators . Clearly these metrics do not distinguish between public sector and business outputs . This would require a measurement of wealth generation from these inputs , for example , and is discussed in the following section . Within the G7 group , relative business fund - ing of higher education R & D is highest in Japan and the United States , and lowest in Italy . Noting this important omission on inputs and outcomes , the footprints never - theless give a snapshot of value - for - money measured by the international impact of the research output of each nation . The United Kingdom does remarkably well on these measures : top of the premier league , fol - lowed by Canada and the United States . I will return later to why this might be so . Figure 6 compares the footprint for the EU15 , including the strongly performing group of small nations in the EU , with the US and UK footprints .

Fuelling economic growth It is also useful to consider indicators of business R & D activity . Table 3 shows the G8 nations ranked in order of business enter - prise research and development expendi - ture as a percentage of GDP . This rank order differs in many respects from that in Table 1 , which was based on research impact . In particular , Japan performs very strongly on this score , and the United States is significantly ahead of the EU15 . The United Kingdom ranks a modest fifth on this important measure . The knowledge base and economic for - tunes of a nation are maintained and devel - oped through the production of highly trained people . This is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for sustainable eco - nomic development : both political and macro - economic factors , including infra - structure investment , must also be in place . One measure of a nation’s knowledge base is its output of PhD students ( Table 3 ) . Nor - malized to national populations , Germany , the United Kingdom and France are ahead of the United States on this measure , and Japan is relatively low down . Comparing these rankings with the figures for the proportion of the workforce in full - time employment as researchers reveals very different cultural practices ( Table 3 ) . On this measure the strong economic performances of Japan and the United States show clearly , taking first feature 314 NATURE | VOL 430 | 15 JULY 2004 | www . nature . com / nature indicator shows big changes over the ten - year period of this study . For the comparator group there was an average decline of 1 . 8 % in business investment as a percentage of total public spending on R & D . The Italian investment as a percentage of publicly funded R & D fell from 3 . 4 % to 0 . 6 % ; Poland also suffered a large fall . But Switzerland , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom showed large increases , the UK increase pulling it up from a low of 6 . 5 % in 1995 to the current level of11 % ofpublicly funded R & D . This is the highest in the G8 group , followed by Canada and Germany at 7 % , France at 5 . 5 % and the United States at 3 . 5 % . An unequal world The countries occupying the top eight places in the science citation rank order ( Table 1 ) produced about 84 . 5 % of the top 1 % most cited publications between 1993 and 2001 . The next nine countries pro - duced 13 % , and the the final group share 2 . 5 % . There is a stark disparity between the first and second divisions in the scientific impact of nations . Moreover , although my analysis includes only 31 of the world’s 193 countries , these produce 97 . 5 % of the world’s most cited papers . The political implications of this last comparison are difficult to exaggerate . South Africa , at 29th place in my rank ordering , is the only African country on the list . The Islamic countries are only represented by Iran at 30th , despite the high GDP of many of them and the prominence of some indi - viduals , such as Nobel prizewinners Abdus Salam ( physics , 1979 ) and Ahmed Zewail ( chemistry , 1999 ) 7 . My key point in response to these statis - tics is that sustainable economic develop - ment in highly competitive world markets requires a direct engagement in the genera - tion of knowledge .

In Japan , industry tends to employ R & D personnel with first degrees and pro - vide on - the - job training , with the expecta - tion that employees will stay in the company all their working life . In Europe and the United States , in many industries , particu - larly outside engineering , it is more common to employ R & D personnel after PhD train - ing . There is probably an advantage in the increased mobility of the R & D workforce with more generalized training up to PhD level , particularly during an economic downturn . The private sector’s annual investment in the public research sector is a useful measure of the interaction and knowledge transfer between business and higher education .

Nations exporting natural resources such as gold and oil can import technology and expertise , but only until these resources are exhausted . For them , sustainability should imply investment in alternative agricultural and technological capabilities through improvements in their skills base . The cycles of poverty and dependence will only be broken by capacity - building between nations of high and low science intensity , often characterized as the North and the South . But it is important to note that simple citation rankings ( Fig . 2 , Tables 1 and 2 ) can hide important developments , particularly in countries such as China , placed 19th in my rank order , and India , at 22nd , which have developed their science base rapidly and effectively over the past few years . India’s major science institutes have significant strength , produce high - quality graduates , and have made critical contributions to the country’s sustained economic growth , as exemplified by the Bangalore software phenomenon . Similarly , Chinese universities have maintained high standards . With improved investment in research infrastructure and funding , China is attracting back scientists who have trained , and in some cases worked , in other coun - tries , particularly the United States , and is sustaining the fastest economic growth in the world . National science outputs have not yet had a chance to catch up with these developments . There have been several other recent comparisons of research activity . There is little consistency between broad measures of research performance based on either the top four international science prizes 1 or the top 100 most cited individuals in each of 14 scientific fields 9 . Of the top 1 , 222 scientists from this last ranking , 815 , or 66 % , are from the United States and only 251 from the sum feature NATURE | VOL 430 | 15 JULY 2004 | www . nature . com / nature 315 of the United Kingdom ( 100 ) , Germany ( 62 ) , France ( 29 ) , Switzerland ( 26 ) , Sweden ( 17 ) and Italy ( 17 ) . This result is at odds with research output and impact , but matches that based on highly cited papers . The considerably higher salaries that some US universities and institutions use to attract the world’s top scientists is probably a major factor in sustaining this disparity . US universities’ recent attempts to attract the young Russian mathematician Grigory Perelman illustrate this 10 . European nations should take note : particularly at the rarefied upper end , they are operating in a global market , and will need to improve salaries and conditions to compete for the top creative talent . Top of the class The Shanghai Institute of Education has recently published 11 a list of the top 500 world universities . The order is based on the number of Nobel laureates from 1911 to 2002 , highly cited researchers , articles pub - lished in Science and Nature , the number of papers published and an average of these four criteria compared with the number of full - time faculty members in each institu - tion . I believe none of these criteria are as reliable as citations . Based on an equal weighting for these five criteria , 15 ( 75 % ) of the top 20 universities are in the United States , four are in the United Kingdom , and Citations per unit GDP Citations per researcher Citations per unit HERD Per cent GDP spent on higher education R & D Inputs Outputs / outcomes UKCanadaUSFranceItalyGermanyJapan Publicationsper researcher Per cent GDP spent on publicly funded R & D Figure 5 Comparing financial inputs with scientific outputs and outcomes .

The United States also accounts for 75 % of the top 40 institutions . In the top 100 , there are 58 US and 31 Euro - pean universities . The UK Research Assess - ment Exercise has produced a similar trend towards concentration of research excel - lence to that in the United States , with four institutions — Cambridge , Imperial Col - lege , Oxford and University College London — leading the UK research listings and stretching away from the others . By contrast , comparing citations between the United States and the EU15 ( Table 1 and Fig . 1 ) shows that the gap between the two has shrunk significantly since May’s analysis based on figures up to 1993 ( ref . 1 ) . The EU now matches the United States in the physical sciences , engineering and mathe - matics , although it still lags in the life sci - ences ( Fig . 4 ) . The United Kingdom’s share of science citations remains second only to the United States , and in intensity heads up the listing of large nations ( Fig . 2 ) . One para - doxical reason for the United Kingdom’s cur - rent strength was the considerable cutback in public spending on science between 1980 and 1995 . Although many UK scientists campaigned against these cuts , they encour - aged a level of resourcefulness among researchers , and approaches to industry and the EU that are now bearing fruit . For instance , the United Kingdom’s business investment in public research , as a propor - tion of public research R & D , is the highest in the world . And now that the present UK government is increasing funding and rebuilding infrastructure , the pruned plant of UK science is regrowing vigorously . The doubling of the Office of Science and Technology’s science budget between 1997 and 2005 has been followed , as this article goes to press , with a treasury announcement that this budget will be further increased by an average annual growth of 5 . 6 % per year , in real terms , over the three years to March 2008 . This falls within a ten - year science and innovation strategy 12 for public and private UK R & D to reach 2 . 5 % of GDP by 2014 . Among the other big EU players , Ger - many’s contribution over the past 20 years has increased most sharply and is now within a few per cent of the United Kingdom in its share of both citations and most - cited papers . Disciplinary footprints ( Fig . 3 ) show a complementarity in science citations between Germany and the United Kingdom , with German strengths in physical sciences and engineering complementing UK strengths in medical , life and environmental sciences . It is important also to recognize the role played in European science by the smaller northern countries , all of which rate highly in science intensity ( Fig . 2 ) . Thus , taking Bel - gium , Denmark , Finland , the Netherlands , Sweden and Switzerland together , with a total population of 53 million , in 1997 – 2001 this group generated 12 . 7 % of the most cited papers , putting them in the same bracket as the United Kingdom ( 12 . 8 % ) and Germany ( 10 . 4 % ) . Since the combined GDP of these countries is marginally ( 6 % ) smaller than the United Kingdom , their combined science citation intensity is higher . A strong science base need not lead directly to wealth generation . For instance , although the strength of the UK science base has long been acknowledged , it has only recently begun to translate this into the development of high - tech clusters accompa - nying knowledge transfer between higher education and industry . However , strength in science has additional benefits for individ - ual nations , and for the world as a whole . From global terrorism and the spread of dis - ease to the dangers of global warming , we are increasingly facing the sorts of threats for which governments everywhere will need to turn to their scientists . ■ David A .

But now the US Patent and Trademark Office has stepped in to provide some guidance on what nanotechnology really is . The patent office last month unveiled Class 977 for nanotechnology patents . For an invention to qualify , the office says , at least one of its dimensions should be between 1 and 100 nanometres in size , and the tiny size of the device must be essential to its function . This means that some ingredients in sunscreen may well be nanotech , for example , but a computer chip may not be . Worried about overlapping patents being granted amid a flood of claims , the patent office began training its examiners in nanotechnology concepts and terminology , and last November it set up an advisory group of outside lawyers and scientists . The new definition is meant to clear up any remaining confusion for patent officers . Whether it will have the same effect on a general public bombarded with nano - promises remains to be seen . Latin America records rapid rise in research publications Washington Research output is booming in Latin America and Asia , according to the US National Science Foundation ( NSF ) . The number of science and engineering papers published in journals with authors from Latin America tripled from 1988 to 2001 , with Argentina , Brazil , Chile and Mexico leading the way . Asia is also producing more papers , mainly because of a boom in China ( see Nature 426 , 752 – 753 ; 2003 ) . The NSF says the rises are due to policy reform , increases in the number of researchers and the money for salaries , and on key tectonic plate boundaries in western North America , Central America , Sumatra and Taiwan . Their data should tackle such questions as whether tectonic plates are pushed about by new material forming at ocean ridges , or pulled by old ocean floor sliding under continents , and should provide insight into earthquakes and volcanoes . The money comes from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation in San Francisco . NASA’s vomit comet sickens for a final time Washington Wannabe - astronauts , and researchers looking for a weightless environment , will soon have a new craft in which to run their experiments . The ‘vomit comet’— the jet used by NASA to create microgravity by plunging towards Earth in a stomach - clenching dive — took its last flight on 29 October . The plane plunged 50 times during the three - hour flight , giving those on board 30 - second slots for their experiments . Unusually , few of the two dozen seasoned passengers travelling on this final flight were sick . The KC - 135 jet has seen nine years of service with NASA . During this time the crew boasts to having hosted more than 2 , 000 students and cleaned up more than 1 , 000 litres of vomit . The craft will be replaced by a C - 9 plane next year that is likely to have the same sickening effect on its passengers . The first person to vomit in the new craft will probably get “a little plaque — all in good fun , of course” , says test director John Yaniac . Correction David King’s Feature “The scientific impact of nations” ( Nature 430 , 311 – 316 ; 2004 ) states that Japan is “first on higher education” in terms of % GDP spent in G8 nations ( page 313 ) . In fact , as Figure 5 shows , Canada is first and Japan second . news in brief 50 40 30 20 10 01988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 T h o u s a n d s o f a r t i c l e s Year Eastern Europe AsiaLatin America Sub - Saharan Africa North Africa and Near East N A S A / J P L / S P A C E S C I E N C E I N S T . 8 NATURE | VOL 432 | 4 NOVEMBER 2004 | www . nature . com / nature London The Cassini - Huygens spacecraft grazed the atmosphere of Saturn’s moon Titan on 26 October , taking radar images of a cold landscape carved by winds and dotted with what look like lakes . Titan is the second - largest moon in the Solar System and the only one known to have an atmosphere . Its chemical make - up is thought to be similar to that on Earth long before life emerged , but an opaque smog makes it hard to observe Titan’s surface . The recent observations ( right ) indicate that Titan may have lakes of methane , ridges of minerals , and floes of ice . The surface seems to be coated in organic chemicals such as liquid propane or solid acetylene , both of which would be stable at the temperature of (cid:1) 179 (cid:2) C . The Cassini craft is planned to swoop past Atmospheric swoop gives Cassini a titanic view the moon 43 more times before releasing the Huygens probe in December . The probe should float through the atmosphere by parachute and gather more detailed information . a growing tendency for researchers to collaborate in international projects . Other regions fared less well : the research output from Eastern Europe ( including the former Soviet Union ) has actually fallen . Spanish stem - cell law allows IVF embryo use Madrid The rules governing stem - cell research in Spain have been relaxed , thanks to a bill passed on 29 October by the country’s recently elected Socialist government . Research on embryonic stem cells has technically been allowed in Spain since 2003 , but only in limited circumstances and with restrictions . The creation of human embryos specifically for research was prohibited , for example , embryonic stem cells could be studied only if their use was unavoidable , and embryos left over from in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) procedures could not be used if they had been frozen for more than five years . Some restrictions have now been lifted , provided the researchers get permission from the embryo’s parents . “It’s all about making things easier for scientists , ”says Spain’s vice - president , María Teresa Fernández de la Vega . Other European countries that currently allow stem cells to be obtained from IVF embryos include Belgium , Denmark , Finland , Greece , the Netherlands , Sweden and Britain . But Austria , Germany , France and Ireland prohibit the practice . Caltech cash lands Earth scientists a moving study San Diego A US $ 13 - million Tectonic Observatory has been established at the California Institute of Technology , launching an initiative to study the movement of the plates that make up the Earth’s crust .
