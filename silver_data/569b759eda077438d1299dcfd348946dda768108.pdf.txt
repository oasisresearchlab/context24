In cells , actin polymerization at the plasma membrane is induced by the recruitment of proteins such as the Arp2 / 3 complex , and the zyxin / VASP complex 1 – 3 . The physical mechanism of force generation by actin polymerization has been described theoreti - cally using various approaches 4 – 6 , but lacks support from exper - imental data . By the use of reconstituted motility medium 7 , we ﬁnd that the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein 8 , 9 ( WASP ) sub - domain , known as VCA , is sufﬁcient to induce actin polymeriz - ation and movement when grafted on microspheres . Changes in the surface density of VCA protein or in the microsphere diameter markedly affect the velocity regime , shifting from a continuous to a jerky movement resembling that of the mutated ‘hopping’ Listeria 10 . These results highlight how simple physical parameters such as surface geometry and protein density directly affect spatially controlled actin polymerization , and play a fundamental role in actin - dependent movement . Investigations of the pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Shi - gella ﬂexneri were important in identifying many proteins that control cellular actin polymerization and cell motility . These bac - teria move within a cell by inducing actin polymerization at their surface 11 by way of the activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex 12 , 13 . Immunolocalization studies of the Arp2 / 3 complex in the lamelli - podium 14 show that Arp2 / 3 multiplies the ﬁlaments by branching them in a dendritic array 15 , as conﬁrmed by biochemical exper - iments 16 , 17 . More recently , surfaces coated with proteins that induce actin polymerization were used to identify new molecular partners for actin polymerization and assembly 18 , or to visualize microscopi - cally the actin network formed at the surface 19 . Here we consider how the surface concentration of Arp2 / 3 complex activator , or the curvature of the surface on which ﬁlament branching and growth occur , can affect and control actin - based movement . We have used beads of various diameters ( 1 – 10 m m ) grafted with the VCA fragment ( VCA indicates verprolin - hom - ology , coﬁlin - homology , and acidic regions ) , which constitutively activates Arp2 / 3 complex . We placed the beads in a medium containing a minimal number of puriﬁed proteins that support the movement of L . monocytogenes or S . ﬂexneri 7 . After a certain time that depends on their size , the beads generated behind them a comet ( tail ) made of actin ﬁlaments and started moving . We identiﬁed three main characteristic regimes of motion : continuous ( smooth ) , intermittent or erratic , and periodic or saltatory move - ment . We believe that this is the ﬁrst evidence that transition from continuous to saltatory movement can be achieved simply by a change in a physical parameter — that is , the surface density or the bead diameter . The VCA - coated beads 18 ( 1 – 10 m m in diameter ) all had the same saturating surface density C s of VCA , as conﬁrmed by SDS – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS – PAGE ) ( data not shown ) . We placed the beads in the mixture of puriﬁed proteins 7 , and found that the bead size had a signiﬁcant effect on the move - ment type and the comet structure ( Fig . 1 ) . Small beads ( 1 – 2 m m diameter ) moved steadily at a constant velocity ( Fig . 1a ) , as reported in other experimental systems 20 . Unexpectedly , larger beads dis - played a jerky motion . The irregularities in the movement are illustrated by the irregular density ( grey level ) of the comet ( Fig . 1b and c ) . Furthermore , beads larger than 4 . 5 m m diameter moved in a periodic hopping manner ( Fig . 1c ) , very similar to the move - ment of mutated ‘hopping’ Listeria 10 . For intermediate - sized beads ( 3 m m in diameter ) , a transient or even chaotic movement was observed : the beads hopped randomly , ﬂuctuating from smooth to jerky movement ( Fig . 1b ) . All beads of the same nominal diameter developed comets and showed the same type of motion when sampling the microscope ﬁeld of view ( typically up to 50 beads ) , showing the robustness of the system . In these experiments , the surface density of VCA proteins on beads of different diameter was C s (cid:136) ( 6 ^ 1 ) £ 10 2 2 - molecules nm 2 2 . This value corresponds to a maximal surface concentration of VCA . The capacity of immobilized VCA to activate Arp2 / 3 was evaluated and compared with the activity of VCA in the soluble form using the ﬂuorescence of pyrenyl - actin to monitor the polymerization process . The assay was carried out with identical amounts of immobilized or soluble VCA in parallel . This proved that the speciﬁc activity of VCAwas the same in both cases , and that the surface concentration of active VCAwas independent of the size of the bead . Mean velocity values , V mean , of beads moving in the solution of puriﬁed proteins are given in Table 1 . This mean velocity is linearly dependent on the inverse bead diameter . Beads of 1 m m diameter placed in the mixture of puriﬁed proteins or in HeLa cell extracts ( prepared as previously described 21 ) moved with the same average velocity . But in puriﬁed protein solution , 100 % of the beads started moving by breaking the surrounding symmetrical actin gel ( ‘sym - metry breaking’ ) within a few minutes , whereas in the case of cell extracts , symmetry breaking occurred only after 20 minutes and for less than 10 % of the beads . Moreover , the velocity ﬂuctuations in the movement of a single bead were 70 % in puriﬁed proteins as compared to 15 % in cell extracts . This can be related to the lower viscosity of the puriﬁed protein mixture , as shown in a recent Figure1 Thethreemainregimesofmotionofthebeadsasafunctionofbeaddiameter . In all cases , the beads have a saturated surface concentration of VCA .

Beads of diameter . 3 m m placed in cell extracts only rarely produced a comet , and could not be statistically characterized . Using video phase - contrast optical microscopy , we measured two quantities as a function of time t : the curvilinear distance D ( t ) from the end of the comet to the bead centre , and the velocity ( the time derivative d D ( t ) / d t ) . These two quantities are respectively plotted in Fig . 2a and b for a 4 . 5 - m m bead at C s moving in a periodic fashion . Even though actin depolymerization occurs , the end of the comet remained visible until the end of the experiment . The beads that move periodically display a periodic comet structure ( Fig . 1c ) . Analysis of the grey - level intensity of the actin gel along the comet as a function of the distance X (cid:136) D ( t ) 2 R , where R is the bead radius , was carried out on a ﬁnal image . The time dependence of the grey intensity was deduced ( Fig . 2c ) . A correlation was observed between velocity and grey - scale intensity along the comet ( Fig . 2b and c , respectively ) . The velocity of the bead is maximal when the gel density is minimal ( low grey level ) and vice versa . This correlation can be explained by means of an elastic analysis 5 , 23 ( see Supplemen - tary Information ) . In this analysis , a friction force F f , opposing a propulsion force F e , results from the connection of the gel ( via VCA molecules ) to the surface of the bead . The model shows that if the molecular connections can break , the friction will depend non - monotonically on the velocity 5 , 23 . Consequently , saltatory and continuous regimes are predicted . The characteristic distance D D cycle determined by fast Fourier transform ( FFT ) analysis of the grey - scale intensity as a function of X is 5 . 0 ^ 0 . 8 m m , which corresponds to the average size of a step ( Fig . 2a ) . The characteristic time D T cycle ( also determined by FFT analysis ) is 10 . 7 ^ 2 . 0 minutes . This time is independent of the bead diameter within experimental error , in contrast to D D cycle that decreases with the bead size : for 6 m m , D D cycle (cid:136) 3 . 8 ^ 0 . 3 m m , whereas for 10 m m , D D cycle (cid:136) 2 . 5 ^ 0 . 4 m m . For 6 - m m - diameter beads and above , the uncertainty in D D cycle is rather small ( about 10 % ) and reﬂects a better - deﬁned period than for 4 . 5 - m m - diameter beads . Stepping behaviour at a molecular scale ( 5 . 4 nm ) was reported for Listeria 24 , and these authors suggest that it may reﬂect a highly coordinated progress along many ﬁlaments , or discrete events of individual actin ﬁlament attachment / detachment to the bacterial surface , which is more likely . We believe that the macro - scopic steps on the micrometre length scale observed in our experiments represent a phenomenon that results from a coordi - nated collective process of a large number of connected ( branched ) ﬁlaments . The two phenomena may act in concert , but our experimental set - up cannot detect discrete molecular events .

We found a power - law dependence , with K proportional to D 2 ( 1 . 1 ^ 0 . 1 ) . If we consider that the density of actively pushing ﬁlaments is constant for all beads , an analysis 25 of the bead trajectories based on the Elastic Brownian Ratchet ( EBR ) model predicts a power of 2 2 , which is not in agreement with our results . A possible reason for this discrepancy is the assumption 25 that each pushing ﬁlament is randomly placed on the surface , whereas in practice the ﬁlaments are connected and their actions can be correlated . An early step in actin - based motility of spherical objects in cells , such as lysosomes and endocytic vesicles 26 , 27 , is the breakage of the symmetrical actin gel that surrounds the bead 28 . We characterized symmetry breaking by measuring the time from the instant the beads were placed into the motility medium until they started to move . This time increased linearly with the diameter of the beads ( Fig . 3 ) . This linearity can be understood by considering that the actin gel is under tension . Owing to spherical geometry , the growing actin gel is stretched , which results in the development of a lateral stress , j vv , that is maximal at the outer surface of the gel . In turn , the stretched gel exerts a normal stress on the bead 21 . j vv depends on the Young’s modulus C , the thickness of the gel , e , and the radius of the bead , R , as j vv (cid:136) Ce / R . This relation is still valid at the time the gel fractures . If the thickness of the gel at that time is sufﬁciently smaller than its thickness in the stationary condition , then e increases linearly with time as a function of the polymerization velocity v p : e (cid:136) v p t . The time of symmetry breaking is given by : t c (cid:136) j c vv v p R C (cid:136) a R (cid:136) a 2 D where j c vv is the critical stress necessary to initiate a fracture ; t c is proportional to the radius , or the bead diameter D . We can estimate the validity of this model by evaluating the slope a (cid:136) a / 2 . We observed experimentally that the ratio e / R is of the order of 1 , and using the relation j c vv (cid:136) Ce = R we deduce that a (cid:136) 1 / v p . The experi - mental value of the slope a is 2 . 1 ^ 0 . 2 min m m 2 1 , thus a (cid:136) 4 . 2 ^ 0 . 4 min m m 2 1 and we ﬁnd that v p (cid:136) 0 . 24 ^ 0 . 02 m m min 2 1 . This value is about one order of magnitude smaller than the value we obtained in stress - free pyrene assay measurements , owing to the stress exerted on the surface 21 . The value of t c changes with the VCA surface density — for example , for 6 - m m beads , t c increases when the VCAconcentration decreases . In cells , vesicle size and membrane composition are probably determining factors for symmetry breaking . To ﬁnd out how the surface density of VCA controls motility , we tested beads ( 4 . 5 m m in diameter ) coated with different concen - trations of VCA . Decreasing the VCA surface concentration by a factor of 2 ( 50 % saturation of the surface , as determined by SDS – PAGE analysis ) induces a transition from saltatory to continuous motion ( data not shown ) . This transition can be related to the drop in the friction force due to the reduction of the surface density of VCA , as qualitatively explained by the elastic analysis 5 , 23 . The surface concentration of active VCA was measured using polymerization assay , and was found to be one - sixth of the value under saturating conditions . At concentrations corresponding to a 50 - fold decrease of active VCA , no movement was detected . The surface concen - tration at which the transition occurs was found to depend on the bead diameter . Although the system described here is far from the complexity of a cell , the use of a limited set of proteins enabled us to identify the physical relationship between surface geometry and the Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent actin polymerization . It also shows that rel - evant concentrations of proteins may have important implications for actin - dependent morphogenesis in cell protrusions , as recently shown in cultured cells 29 . If actin polymerization is capable of deforming a plasma membrane , or , in other words , changing the surface geometry , then the resulting changes in membrane shape can affect subsequent polymerization at the same site — and con - sequently further out , owing to elasticity . More - complex bio - chemical changes , such as activation of small GTPases or protein phosphorylation , may act on these inherent physical parameters rather than directly induce the cell movement . Furthermore , we note that changes in physical parameters can mimic the pheno - type of the ‘hopping’ Listeria , which was previously induced by altering the ActA protein sequence 10 . The ability of physical parameters to reproduce a protein effect greatly enlarges the scope of cellular actin cytoskeleton dynamics , and hence offers more ways to explain the wide range of actin structures within cells at a local level . A Methods Derivatization of beads with VCA VCAwas bacterially expressed as a glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion protein by inserting the corresponding DNA fragments from pSR a - Puro in a modiﬁed version of pGEX - 4T - 1 with an extra Spe I site . The stock solution was 1 . 5mgml 2 1 , as determined by Bradford assay . Polystyrene beads of diameter ranging from 1 to 10 m m were purchased from Polyscience . Beads were incubated in the VCA solution at concentrations in the range of 0 . 01 – 1mgml 2 1 foronehouratroomtemperature . Weusedaninitialvolumeofbeadsthat was proportional to the diameter : that is , volumes of 1 m l and 10 m l for beads of 1 m m and 10 m m diameter respectively , given that the volume fraction of the beads in the stock solution was constant , equal to 2 . 5 % .

No vasodilator - simulated phosphoprotein ( VASP ) was needed . A 0 . 3 - m l volume of bead suspension was added to 20 m l of motility medium . The small volume of the beads ensured that the composition of the motility medium remainedunchanged . Thesamplewasplacedimmediatelybetweenaglassslideandaglass coverslip 18 £ 18mm , sealed with vaseline : lanolin : parafﬁn ( at weight ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 ) . To prevent squeezing of the objects , the distance between slide and coverslip was controlled using an inert polyethylene glycol spacer ( Goodfellow ) to obtain a ratio between sample height and bead diameter of 5 to 6 . We found that this ratio ensured that the beads with their comets do not stick to the coverslip walls . In all experiments , symmetry breaking occurs spontaneously , and 100 % of the beads generate a comet . The movement of the microspheres was followed for 1 . 5hours by time - lapse optical video - microscopy ( phase contrast and ﬂuorescence microscopy , Olympus microscope , £ 100 ) . Measurements of bead velocity and the grey - level intensity along the comets were performed using METAMORPH and a software program consisting of a user module ( O . Cardoso ) for NIH Image ( W . Rasband , National Institutes of Health ) . Both source code and compiled application for MacOS are available at http : / / canardo . lbhp . jussieu . fr / cardoso / .

Determination of activity of immobilized VCA using a polymerization assay VCA activity was measured as the maximal rate of polymerization of pyrenyl - actin ( 2 . 5 m M ) inthe presenceof Arp2 / 3complex ( 20nM ) andVCAatdifferentconcentrations as described 13 . A calibration curve was ﬁrst established using known concentrations of soluble VCA . The polymerization assays were then performed by adding immobilized VCA in the ﬂuorescence cuvette . 16 % sucrose ( w / v ) was included in the polymerization buffer to prevent sedimentation of the polystyrene beads . The concentration of active immobilized VCAwas determined by comparison of the rates measured using VCA - derivatized beads with the calibration curve as a function of soluble VCA . The concentration of actually immobilized VCAwas derived from SDS – PAGE . The speciﬁc activity of immobilized VCAwas derived . Received 9 January ; accepted 20 March 2002 . 1 . Welch , M .

Rotavirus , the major cause of life - threatening infantile gastro - enteritis , is a member of the Reoviridae 1 . Although the structures of rotavirus 2 and other members of the Reoviridae 3 , 4 have been extensively studied , little is known about the structures of virus - encoded non - structural proteins that are essential for genome replication and packaging . The non - structural protein NSP2 of rotavirus , which exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase , single - stranded RNA binding 5 , and nucleic - acid helix - destabilizing 6 activities , is a major component of viral replicase complexes 7 , 8 . We present here the X - ray structure of the functional octamer 9 of NSP2 determined to a resolution of 2 . 6 A˚ . The NSP2 monomer has two distinct domains . The amino - terminal domain has a new fold . The carboxy - terminal domain resembles the ubiquitous cellular histidine triad ( HIT ) group of nucleotidyl hydrolases 10 . This structural similarity suggests that the nucleotide - binding site is located inside the cleft between the two domains . Promi - nent grooves that run diagonally across the doughnut - shaped octamer are probable locations for RNA binding . Several RNA binding sites , resulting from the quaternary organization of NSP2 monomers , may be required for the helix destabilizing activity of NSP2 and its function during genome replication and packaging . Rotavirus is a large and complex virus . Its genome , enclosed within three concentric capsid layers , consists of 11 segments of double - stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) that code for six structural and six non - structural proteins ( NSPs ) 1 . Several in vivo and in vitro studies have strongly implicated NSP2 , a highly basic protein of relative molecular mass M r (cid:136) 35 , 000 which exits as octamers , in genome replication and packaging . This protein , in association with viral RNA and polymerase , localizes to viroplasms of the infected cells where these processes occur 7 , 11 , 12 . Temperature - sensitive mutants of NSP2 fail to replicate the genome and produce mostly empty particles , which implicates NSP2 in genome replication and packa - ging 13 , 14 . Recent studies on recombinant NSP2 have shown that it is a magnesium - dependent NTPase that binds to ssRNA in a sequence - independent manner 5 and exhibits nucleic - acid helix - destabilizing activity 6 . On the basis of these studies it is suggested that NSP2 functions as a molecular motor that uses the energy derived from NTP hydrolysis to package the viral genome 9 . In its function , NSP2 may be homologous to NS2 ( refs 15 , 16 ) of blue - tongue virus and j NS of orthoreovirus 17 . To understand the structural mechanisms underlying the function of NSP2 , we have letters to nature NATURE | VOL 417 | 16 MAY 2002 | www . nature . com 311 © 2002 Macmillan Magazines Ltd
