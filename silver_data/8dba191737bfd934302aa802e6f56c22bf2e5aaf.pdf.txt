While considerable effort has focused in the regulators involved in the transition process , we have focused on consequences of EMT to prosurvival signaling . Changes in distinct metastable and ‘epigentic - ally - ﬁxed’ EMT states were measured by correlation of protein , phosphoprotein , phosphopeptide and RNA tran - script abundance . The assembly of 1167 modulated com - ponents into functional systems or machines simpliﬁed biological understanding and increased prediction conﬁ - dence highlighting four functional groups : cell adhesion and migration , metabolism , transcription nodes and pro - liferation / survival networks . A coordinate metabolic reduction in a cluster of 17 free - radical stress pathway components was observed and correlated with reduced glycolytic and increased oxidative phosphorylation enzyme capacity , consistent with reduced cell cycling and reduced need for macromolecular biosynthesis in the mesenchymal state . An attenuation of EGFR autophosphorylation and a switch from autocrine to paracrine - competent EGFR sig - naling was implicated in the enablement of tumor cell chemotaxis . A similar attenuation of IGF1R , MET and RON signaling with EMT was observed . In contrast , EMT increased prosurvival autocrine IL11 / IL6 - JAK2 - STAT signaling , autocrine ﬁbronectin - integrin a 5 b 1 activation , autocrine Axl / Tyro3 / PDGFR / FGFR RTK signaling and autocrine TGF b R signaling . A relatively uniform loss of polarity and cell – cell junction linkages to actin cytoskele - ton and intermediate ﬁlaments was measured at a systems level . A more heterogeneous gain of ECM remodeling and associated with invasion and migration was observed . Correlation to stem cell , EMT , invasion and metastasis datasets revealed the greatest similarity with normal and cancerous breast stem cell populations , CD49f hi / EpCAM - / lo and CD44 hi / CD24 lo , respectively .

While much effort has focused on the regulators and processes involved in the conversion of cells from an epithelial to mesenchymal state , relatively less effort has been invested toward the conse - quences of EMT on tumor cell resistance to chemo - , radio - and targeted - therapies . Using models of both metastable and epigenetically - ﬁxed EMT , we have sought to deﬁne at a molecular level the signaling and survival changes which occur as a consequence of EMT . Epithelial - derived tumor cells are capable of transdif - ferentiation to a more mesenchymal phenotype , a process resembling EMT [ 1 , 2 ] . Similarly epithelial tumors may , directly or through EMT , promote genetic alterations , a loss of heterozygosity and a wound - like activation of surrounding or EMT - generated stromal cells [ 3 , 4 ] . Tumor localized inﬂammatory cells and stromal ﬁbroblasts can comprise up to 50 – 70 % of the tumor mass and there is active multi - directional communication between these co - evolving [ 5 ] cell types that comprise cancer tissue [ 6 , 7 ] . For example , tumor cells and inﬁltrating inﬂam - matory cells promote the formation of desmoplastic stroma that provide paracrine survival factors to tumor cells [ 8 ] where tumor cells and cancer - associated ﬁbroblasts become more similar than non - involved ﬁbroblasts . Inﬂammatory signals in turn can promote EMT [ 9 ] . The activation and hyperproliferation of stromal cells and M2 macrophages facilitate migration of EMT - derived mesen - chymal - like tumor cells [ 7 , 10 , 11 ] . Mesenchymal - like tumor cells gain migratory capacity at the expense of proliferative potential [ 12 ] . The migration and invasion of epithelial - derived carcinoma cells through basement membrane and into adjacent tissue has been associated with EMT - like mechanisms [ 13 , 14 ] , acting on single cells and / or cell sheets [ 15 ] . A reverse conversion , a mesen - chymal - epithelial transition ( MET ) , is thought to be required to regenerate a proliferative state and form ma - crometastases resembling the primary tumor at distant sites [ 16 ] , though co - migration of EMT and non - EMT cells has been proposed [ 17 ] . There is histological evidence from patient tumor specimens suggesting that over time select tumor cells can co - express both proliferative and migratory programs and exhibit a spindleoid sarcoma - like phenotype [ 18 ] . While pure spindle - cell carcinomas of the lung are relatively infrequent , representing approximately two per - cent of NSCLC cases , sarcomatoid elements within tumor nests are more common and appear to be derived by EMT - like transitions [ 19 ] . The molecular circuitry that controls epithelial—mes - enchymal transitions in normal embryonic development , in ﬁbrotic diseases and wound repair , and during tumor pro - gression has been an area of active investigation . The tumor heterogeneity , as a consequence of EMT and the relative insensitivity of mesenchymal - like tumor cells to targeted - , chemo - and radio - therapies , are important factors which determine overall patient outcome . Most notably , tumor cells deriving from EMT - like transitions have many of the properties of cancer stem cells [ 20 ] and show general resistance to chemotherapy [ 21 , 22 ] . For example the EMT phenotype produced by Twist expression has been shown to inactivate pro - senescence pathways [ 23 ] , however in general the molecular mechanisms pro - moting the anti - apoptotic phenotype associated with EMT are not well described at a molecular level . Epithelial tissues normally use autocrine and paracrine ligand activation of EGFR family and IGF1R signaling to promote basal cell self - renewal , while in epithelial - derived cancers abnormal activation of these pathways promotes tumor expansion and progression . Our previous work has shown that through EMT - like transitions many carcinoma cell types acquire abnormal EGFR - and IGF1R - indepen - dent survival signals to escape anoikis and senescence during cell detachment and migration [ 24 , 25 ] . EMT - derived cells show relative resistance to selective IGF1R / insulin receptor inhibition [ 24 ] or to EGFR inhibition [ 26 – 33 ] in multiple solid tumor types . This is paradoxical in that chronic activation of EGFR [ 34 , 35 ] and IGF1R [ 36 ] can promote EMT - like transitions , but once having occurred these signals are rendered redundant and alter - native pathways are engaged in the maintenance of the mesenchymal - like state . EMT - derived changes in survival , and metastatic signaling networks has medical importance in the development of anti - cancer combinations which not only cause apoptosis of primary tumor cells but also impact the migratory stem - like cell populations from which cancer can recur [ 6 , 37 , 38 ] . Here we have investigated both the molecular changes which initially promote EMT - like transition as well as the more distant consequences toward survival , metabolic and cell adhesion signaling networks . At least three distinct EMT states can be discerned ; a pre - or potential - EMT state , a reversible ‘metastable’ EMT state and an ‘epigenetically - ﬁxed’ EMT state . EMT - associated networks were identiﬁed and measured within three inducible ‘metastable’ models , H358 / doxZeb1 , H358 / doxSnail and H358 / TGF b . Similarly we compared network changes in four NSCLC lines with either epithelial or ‘epigenetically - ﬁxed’ mesenchymal - like cell phenotypes . A combination of overlapping experi - mental approaches , measuring protein , phosphoprotein and RNA transcript abundance , were used to quantitate signal - ing network differences between these three different epi - thelial , metastable mesenchymal and epigenetically - ﬁxed mesenchymal EMT states . The extensive cellular repro - gramming associated with EMT resulted in marked shifts in autocrine survival , cell - junction and metabolic networks , relevant to drug discovery targeting EMT - like transitions and mesenchymal stem - like cancer cells . 138 Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2011 ) 28 : 137 – 155 123 Experimental procedures Full , detailed experimental and analysis procedures are provided in Supplemental Information . Cell culture conditions , doxycycline - inducible EMT and immunoblotting Human NSCLC lines H292 , H358 , Calu6 and H1703 were cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) . To promote EMT in H358 cells TGF b ( 10 ng / ml ) was added to complete media for 7 days . H358 / Snail and H358 / Zeb1 were expressed under the control of the doxycycline inducible CMV pro - moter ( pTRE2puro ; invitrogen . com ) using the two vector TET repressor / TET activator system ( ptTS , prTA ; bla R ) based on [ 39 ] . Doxycycline ( 0 . 5 l g / ml ) induction of transgene expression was veriﬁed by immunoblot . Recep - tor phosphotyrosine content in EMT model cell lines also was measured by blot e . l . i . s . a . ( RTK array ; rdsystems . com ) under conditions detailed by the manufacturer . Confocal microscopy Cells grown on glass coverslips were washed and ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in Dulbecco’s PBS followed by per - meabilization in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . E - cadherin ( Santa Cruz , sc21791 ) and vimentin ( Chemicon , AB5733 ) primary antibodies overnight at room temperature and with diluted Alexa - ﬂuor 488 or Alexa - ﬂuor 568 - conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h . Nuclei were stained with 4 0 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( 300 nmol / l for 5 min ) . The images were captured with AxioVision software on a Zeiss AxioObserver microscope and camera and Apotome accessory .

Two fold RNA abundance differences with detection P values of \ 0 . 05 in any of the three H358 models were used as a cutoff . RT - PCR was performed under standard condi - tions to generate DD Ct values for control normalized mes - enchymal—epithelial RNA transcript abundance ratios . Preparation of cell extracts and phosphorylation directed afﬁnity chromatography Membrane , cytosol and nuclear protein fractions were prepared , denatured in 8 M urea , reduced , alkylated , sub - jected to proteolysis with trypsin and desalted on C18 resin . Anti - phosphotyrosine afﬁnity fractions were isolated from Triton X - 100 cell lysates as previously described [ 40 , 41 ] . Serine and threonine phosphorylated peptides were enriched by binding to titanium dioxide . Essentially , phosphopeptides were enriched on TiO 2 beads under acidic conditions and eluted at high pH , 50 % acetonitrile . Lyophilized TiO 2 bound and ﬂow - through fractions were derivitized with stable isotope tags , isotopically labeled peptides combined and subjected to SCX ion exchange , C18 step chromatography , followed LC - tandemMS . Rela - tive peptide quantitation was performed by stable isotope peptide derivitization [ 42 ] . Peptide identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation by LC - tandem MS Tandem mass spectrometry was performed as previously described [ 40 ] . Proteins were identiﬁed from survey and product ion spectra using the Paragon algorithm of Pro - teinPilot ( absciex . com ) searching human SwissProt and UniProt protein databases . When multiple protein isoforms were identiﬁed , only peptides speciﬁc to each detected isoform were used , which factored in ion counts for weighting in the protein ratio calculation [ 43 ] . Parsimony of protein results was assured by rigorous protein inference with the ProGroup algorithm . Protein identiﬁcation com - plied with the guidelines of [ 44 ] where 2 or more unique isoform - speciﬁc peptides were required for inclusion . Proteins identiﬁed with C 95 % conﬁdence with relative abundances between experimental conditions in the upper and lower distribution quartiles ( [ 75 % or \ 25 % ) and with a t - test P value ( for any difference between cell line or biological condition ) of \ 0 . 05 were further considered . Under these conditions false discovery rates ( FDR ) of multiple datasets were typically \ 1 % and correctly binned previously deﬁned benchmark proteins , E - cadherin , c - catenin , a - catenin , vimentin and ﬁbronectin to their respective epithelial or mesenchymal cell states . After protein identiﬁcation at 95 % conﬁdence with 2 or more unique peptides , at least two independent lines of evidence were required for further consideration . Phosphoserine and phosphothreonine containing pep - tides were identiﬁed from TGF b induced H358 cells ( 1 day after TGF b treatment , 10 ng / ml ) using ProteinPilot v3 . 0 ( absciex . com ) and a 95 % peptide conﬁdence threshold . Phosphopeptides were measured by determination of the median normalized iTRAQ quant tag peak areas for the biological duplicate samples . EMT modulated phospho - peptides were selected where the TGF b / control log 2 ratio was [ 1 or \ - 1 and where the control N1 / control N2 was between log2 - 0 . 5 and 0 . 5 .

S1 . Changes in the abundance of proteins , phosphopeptides and RNA transcripts were compared between fractions , experiments and models where member - ship within speciﬁc signaling networks only was established using two or more independent lines of evidence ( Supple - mentary Tables S4 – S8 ) . Pair wiseand three waycomparisons ( Snail - Zeb1 overlap , Snail - TGF b overlap , TGF b - Zeb1 overlap and Snail - TGF b - Zeb1 overlaps , as well as Calu6 and H1703 overlaps ) are presented in Supplementary Table S3 . Cellular components modulated through EMT ( 942 compo - nents ) speciﬁcally in a single model are listed in Supple - mentary Table 12 . Cross - correlation between conditions and the assembly of proteins and encoded proteins within bio - logical systems and assemblies were used to increase statis - tical signiﬁcance and facilitate functional understanding . Proteins and RNA transcripts differentially expressed between EMT - like cell states were grouped according to function using current literature , DAVID , Ingenuity Pathway Assist ( IPA ) and STRING . GO terms were annotationally clustered using DAVID using a signiﬁcance P value cutoff of 0 . 05 ( enrichment score [ 1 . 3 ) ( Supplemental Table S2 ) . In the functionalillustrations of complexesmodulatedduringEMT , proteins were assembled by protein – protein contacts and grouped by systems or machines . Results and Discussion Epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) involves exten - sive transcriptional reprogramming [ 45 ] to partially or fully disassemble epithelial cell sheets and promote the invasion , migration and survival of disseminated mesenchymal - like tumor cells . In order to understand the biological conse - quences of these different states of EMT upon cancer cells we initiated studies to measure the changes in cellular sig - naling , particularly those pathways which promote cell survival and resistance to anti - cancer therapies , in models that represent these different states of EMT . To achieve this we created three models in which EMT was inducible and isogenic to the NSCLC H358 cell line , which harbors a transforming mutation in K - ras , exhibits an epithelial phe - notype and forms cell – cell junctions . H358 cells stably transfected with doxycycline - inducible Zeb1 or Snail cDNAs or exposed to exogenous TGF b ( 10 nM ) over a 7 - day period promoted the downregulation of the epithelial cell marker E - cadherin and the upregulation of the mesen - chymal cell markers vimentin and ﬁbronectin , characteristic of an EMT - like transition . Changes were measured in an isogenic manner , in the presence and absence of the EMT inducers Zeb1 , Snail and TGF b . Thirty - ﬁve individual clones expressing Zeb1 and 23 clones expressing Snail were isolated and characterized for transgene induction and the expression of EMT markers E - cadherin , c - catenin , vimen - tin , ﬁbronectin , with increasing concentrations of doxycy - cline added to the culture media ( Supplementary Figs . S2 and S3 ) . As a control , three vector only clones were isolated and characterized in the presence and absence of doxycy - cline . No change in EMT markers was observed in the vector control lines with doycycline treatment , either by Western blot , by proteomic LC - MS / MS analysis or by microarray analysis ( Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . We also compared these inducible models ( H358 / doxZeb1 , H358 / doxSnail , H358 / TGF b and H358 / vector control ) to four phenotypically epithelial or mesenchymal - like NSCLC lines ( H292 , H358 , Calu6 and H1703 ) . The phenotypes of the epithelial and mesenchymal - like tumor models were characterized by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy examin - ing co - staining for E - cadherin and vimentin and by light microscopy as shown in Fig . 1a . The epithelial models form cell – cell junctions and express membrane localized E - cad - herin . In contrast cell models with a mesenchymal pheno - type ( Calu6 , H1703 , H358 / TGF b , H358 / Snail and H358 / Zeb1 ) exhibited a characteristic scattered spindloid mor - phology ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . S5 ) , lacked E - cadherin expression and expressed perinuclear interme - diate ﬁlaments containing vimentin ( Fig . 1a ) and low levels of cytokeratins 8 and 18 ( not shown ) . These key protein changes between epithelial and mesenchymal NSCLC states served as an expected benchmark demonstrating EMT - like changes and allowed for further experiments measuring signaling network associated with EMT states . The metastable state of these inducible models was reﬂected by the complete or partial reversion by removal of the EMT stimulus , for example by removal of TGF b or doxycycline from the inducible H358 models , which restores cell – cell junctions and their associations with the actin cytoskeleton [ 25 ] . Withdrawal of doxycycline from the induced Zeb1 and Snail models similarly reversed EMT component changes ( Supplementary Fig . S8 ) . Continuous EMT induction for up to 4 months did not appreciably alter the reversible metastable phenotype . A reversible plastic metastable state has been observed in vivo in cells expressing epithelial and mesenchymal splice forms of FGFR2 [ 46 ] . Treatment of the ‘epigenetically - ﬁxed’ H1703 or Calu6 cells with 5 - aza - 2 0 - deoxycytidine ( 10 nM ) for 14 days resulted in decreased vimentin protein and increased E - cadherin and ErbB3 proteins ( data not shown ) , consistent with mesen - chymal to epithelial transition observed with exposure to HDAC inhibitors [ 32 ] . EMT appears to be a continuum , wherein three distinct states can be discerned ; ( 1 ) a potential - EMT state where mesenchymal markers can be expressed in epithelial sheets with intact cell - junctions ; ( 2 ) an early 140 Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2011 ) 28 : 137 – 155 123 reversible ‘metastable’ EMT state ; and ( 3 ) an ‘epigeneti - cally - ﬁxed’ EMT state , irreversible except by chromatin remodeling [ 32 , 47 ] . Overall , the model systems used here represent both epithelial and mesenchymal - like EMT phe - notypes and metastable and epigenetically - ﬁxed chromatin states ( Fig . 1b ) .

E - cadherin containing cell junctions ( green ) are visible in the epithelial lines H292 and H358 . In contrast the metastable H358 / TGF b , H358 / doxSnail and H358 / doxZeb1 cells show a loss of E - cadherin expression , a gain of vimentin expression ( red ) and a characteristic scattered phenotype . Similarly the epigentically ﬁxed NSCLC lines Calu6 and H1703 lack E - cadherin containing cell – cell junctions and express perinuclear vimentin , an intermediate ﬁlament component . b A scheme depicting EMT states within the primary tumor mass , in the tumor periphery and in disseminated tumor cells ( DTCs ) . c Experimental schema for cell fractionation , protein , phosphoprotein and RNA measurements and network enrichment Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2011 ) 28 : 137 – 155 141 123 The consequences of EMT state on signaling changes associated with therapeutic resistance were measured by global measurement of protein , phosphoprotein and RNA transcript abundance ( Fig . 1c ) . Component changes were cross - correlated between cellular fractions , experiments and models where membership within speciﬁc signaling networks was established using two or more independent lines of evidence . Using this stringent cross - correlation strategy , 218 proteins , 146 phosphoproteins and * 1200 RNA transcripts showed differential abundance in the multiple EMT models . Details and statistics are given in Supplementary Table S1 . One hundred sixty - nine EMT components were conﬁrmed by either RT - PCR , immuno - blot or confocal IF ( Supplementary Table S8 ) . Further validation was obtained by comparison of the model sys - tems to each other and to model systems ( EMT , stem cell and metastatic ; Supplementary Table S8 ) present within the literature , where few of the EMT components listed in Supplementary Tables S4 – S8 were modulated in one model alone . Components speciﬁc to a given single model are listed in Supplementary Table S12 . Biological func - tions were clustered and components perturbed by EMT assembled into systems to increase signiﬁcance and facil - itate functional understanding . Metastable and epigenetically - ﬁxed EMT states show molecular heterogeneity Signiﬁcantly enriched functional networks altered between epithelial and mesenchymal states were identiﬁed by functional annotation clustering [ 48 , 49 ] using a signiﬁ - cance threshold of P \ 0 . 05 ( Fig . 2a ; Supplementary Table S2 ) . Highly enriched functions altered by EMT included ( 1 ) the marked alterations in cell – cell junction and adhe - sion networks ; ( 2 ) the switching of cell proliferation and survival networks associated with therapeutic resistance ; and ( 3 ) the transcriptional networks required for repro - gramming cell adhesion , cell survival , redox stress and metabolic pathways . Hierarchical clustering and data intersection analysis of EMT components modulated by Zeb1 , Snail and TGF b revealed differences between the three EMT inducers . From a total of 2973 genes modulated in any of the three H358 EMT models , 16 % were shared between Zeb1 , Snail and TGF b models , 13 . 2 % were shared between Snail and Zeb1 , while only 5 . 6 % were shared between Snail or Zeb1 and the TGF b induced EMT state ( Supplementary Table S3 ) , where the false discovery rate ( FDR ) was \ 1 % . EMT components exclusively modulated in a single model , for example with Zeb1 but not with Snail or TGF b , are listed in Supplementary Table S12 . We examined both down regulated and up regulated gene sets independently to ask whether loss and gain of RNA transcripts were similarly correlated across models , by calculating overlapping genes or proteins as a percent - age of non - redundant group size ( Fig . 2b ; Supplementary Table S3 ) . Zeb1 - Snail overlapping down - regulated genes were 3 - fold greater represented than either TGF b - Zeb1 or TGF b - Snail overlapping genes ; up - regulated genes showed a 4 - fold greater similarity between Zeb1 and Snail com - pared with TGF b . The subset and clustering analysis of mRNA abundance data indicated an increased diversity of modulated genes in the TGF b model relative to the more closely related Zeb1 and Snail models . We asked whether the loss of epithelial components was more uniform than the acquisition of mesenchymal com - ponents . The concordance of decreased epithelial genes ( 20 % ) in all three inducible H358 models was slightly higher than the overlap of increased mesenchymal genes ( 15 % or 1 . 3 - fold ) . Similarly , comparison of the ﬁxed - state NSCLC models showed concordance of decreased genes between EMT states to be 1 . 4 - fold higher than increased genes ( 52 % vs . 36 % , respectively ) . When we compared the reversible ‘metastable’ H358 models with the ‘epigeneti - cally - ﬁxed’ NSCLC lines the trend for concordance of loss of epithelial markers ( 10 % ) over the gain of mesenchymal markers ( 2 % ) was 5 - fold . These data indicate that the loss of epithelial components during EMT showed greater uniformity than the gain of mesenchymal components . These data suggest that the enhanced diversity of mesen - chymal - like tumor cell states could contribute to the emergence of therapeutically resistant cell populations . This hypothesis is explored further below in the context of the extensive reprogramming of cell survival networks mediated by EMT - like transitions . There are a number of literature reports of gene signa - tures correlating EMT , metastatic and stem cell pheno - types . Comparison of the EMT dataset obtained here with eighteen datasets from the stem cell , invasion / metastasis and EMT ﬁelds [ 50 – 63 ] indicate the NSCLC EMT models were most closely related with normal and cancer - derived mammary stem cells ( Fig . 2c ; Supplementary Tables S8 and S11 ) . The greatest intersection of EMT modulated protein and mRNA abundance , adjusted for dataset size , were observed for normal mammary stem cells selected for CD49f ? / EpCAM low [ 63 ] and breast cancer stem cells selected for CD44 ? / CD24 - [ 51 ] . These comparisons do highlight the heterogeneity of EMT and stem cell model systems and states , suggesting a high degree of plasticity which may contribute to resistance to single agent anti - cancer therapies . Reduced cell cycling in metastable but not epigenically - ﬁxed EMT states The metastable EMT phenotype driven by Zeb1 , Snail or TGF b was accompanied by a decrease in the transcription 142 Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2011 ) 28 : 137 – 155 123 and regulatory phosphorylation of cell cycling components . These data were consistent with our previous ﬁndings that after 7 days TGF b mediated EMT in H358 cells increased cell cycle time 1 . 7 - fold over untreated control cells [ 64 ] where a general decrease in transcript levels for cyclin isoforms was observed ( Supplementary Table S5 ) . Reduced proliferation also was observed for the H358 / Zeb1 and H358 / Snail models but not for the vector control H358 cells and not in the absence of doxycycline ( Sup - plementary Fig . S6 ) . Attenuated cell cycling with Enrichment for functional systems decreased ( top ) or increased ( bottom ) with EMT ( p < 0 . 05 ) .

The NSCLC EMT dataset was most closely related to normal and cancer - derived mammary stem cells , either by number of overlapping markers or when adjusted for dataset size ( composite score ) Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2011 ) 28 : 137 – 155 143 123 metastable EMT was apparent from phosphorylation site analysis early following TGF b induced EMT ( Supple - mentary Table S9 ) . Within 24 h of TGF b treatment decreased phosphorylation and activation of cell cycle kinases and their substrates was observed . For example , signiﬁcantly reduced phosphorylation of DNA ligase 1 ( LIG1 ) on S66 and S76 , required for cell cycle traverse and DNA repair [ 65 ] , MCM2 on S139 , a site regulating cell cycle traverse and NUMA1 on S1757 and S1760 were observed . These data support the reduction in cell cycling in the H358 background within 24 h of EMT initiation by Zeb1 , Snail and TGF b . This is in marked contrast to NSCLC epigenetically - ﬁxed mesenchymal cells that show both the ability to migrate and proliferate . We have shown previously that there was no difference in proliferation rate , as measured by BrdU incorporation , when comparing epithelial and mesenchymal states [ 31 ] . Cell - junction assemblies and polarity networks are repressed with EMT The loss of cell polarity and cell – cell junctions and the partial disassembly of epithelial tissues are changes asso - ciated with cancer progression to an invasive , metastatic state . The analyses presented here provide a comprehensive overview of the extensive changes observed in these important cellular protein complexes during the EMT process ( Fig . 3 ) . As expected [ 66 ] a marked and consistent down - regulation of cell - polarity , tight - junction , adherens - junction , desmosomal - junction and basement membrane adhesion components was correlated with a mesenchymal EMT state , events that served as a technical benchmark to validate the experimental and statistical approaches used . Note to verify these ﬁndings , representative protein and RNA changes were conﬁrmed by immunoblot and TaqMan RT - PCR , respectively ( Supplementary Table S4 ) . In both inducible H358 and established NSCLC model systems , a down regulation of thirty - three tight junction and polarity components was observed ( Fig . 3 ) . The organizing complex required for the establishment of api - cal - basal polarity in epithelial cells , comprising ParD3 , ParD6 , Crb3 , Lin7C and LLGL2 , was reduced in abun - dance following EMT , as was tyrosine phosphorylation of ParD3 . Polarity organizing complexes with Par and Crb family proteins are required for the initiation of tight junction formation between adjacent epithelial cells [ 67 ] . Tight junctions [ 68 ] were assembled via the transmem - brane receptors occludin ( OCLN ) , claudin3 ( CLDN3 ) , claudin7 ( CLDN7 ) and marvelD2 to link adjacent epithe - lial cells . These receptors in turn establish cell – cell mechanical strength by tethering to the actin cytoskele - ton via ZO1 / 2 / 3 ( TJPs ) , INADL , CGNL1 , a - catenin ( CTNNA1 ) and eplin ( LIMA1 ) . The anchoring of claudin7 junctions to actin ﬁlaments also is thought to occur through its interaction with the epithelial marker Epcam ( TAC - STD1 ) , a - catenin and a - actinin - 4 , which were markedly reduced in abundance in comparing mesenchymal and epithelial cell states . Similarly proteins involved in the assembly and linkage of junctional complexes with the actin cytoskeleton were attenuated with EMT , notably BAIAP2 , DIAPH1 and AHNAK . Twenty - two cell – cell adherens junction components were coordinately attenuated with EMT in the multiple model systems ( Fig . 3 ) . In adherens junctions [ 69 ] , indi - vidual E - cadherin ( CDH1 ) and P - cadherin ( CDH3 ) pro - teins located on adjacent cells bind in a calcium - dependent manner and are linked to their respective actin cytoskele - tons via b - catenin ( CTNB1 ) / c - catenin ( JUP ) , a - catenin , eplin protein complex or through JUP , a - catenin ( CTN ) and eplin ( LIMA1 ) linkages . Adherens junction assembly is regulated by protein tyrosine phosphorylation . Both total and tyrosine phosphorylated forms of a - , b - and d - catenins were attenuated in the ﬁxed mesenchymal state , while metastable EMT models showed a more variable loss of adherens junction components 7 days post induction ( Supplementary Table S4 ) . Additional adherens junction linkages to the actin cytoskeleton are made through nectin2 ( PVRL2 ) , a - catenin and eplin ( LIMA1 ) or through afadin ( MLLT4 ) , LMO7 and a - actinin4 ( ACTN4 ) , which were generally attenuated during EMT . In desmosomal junctions , desmocollin2 ( DSC2 ) and desmoglein2 ( DCG2 ) on adjacent cells can form com - plexes with c - catenin ( JUP ) , a - catenin and eplin ( LIMA1 ) to link epithelial cells to the actin cytoskeleton [ 70 ] . DSG2 and DSC2 proteins are enriched in poorly differentiated basal epithelial cells . Linkage to c - catenin , plakoglobin2 / 3 ( PKP2 / 3 ) and desmoplakin ( DSP ) provide additional teth - ering to keratin 7 , 8 , 18 and 19 containing intermediate ﬁlaments . These junction complex components were gen - erally attenuated following EMT , with the exception of desmoglein , desmocollin and keratins in the single H358 / TGF b model where no change or increased protein abun - dance was observed , respectively ( Fig . 3 , Supplementary Table S4 ) . The loss of phosphotyrosine on cell junction components generally tracked with overall protein loss in the ﬁxed state NSCLC models ( adjusted r 2 = 0 . 73 , F \ 0 . 0001 ) , but was not signiﬁcant in TGF b induced H358 cells ( adjusted r 2 = 0 . 32 , F \ 0 . 06 ) . Taken together these data indicate that , in the ﬁxed - state models , protein loss , in part through reduced transcription , can account for much of the reduction in protein tyrosine phosphate content . Finally , the loss of a 6 integrin , tetraspanin - 1 ( TSPAN1 ) , laminin - A5 ( LAMA5 ) , ladinin ( LAD1 ) , AGR2 / 3 and MPZL2 ( EVA ) would be predicted to weaken cell – cell junctions and decrease cell attachment to base - ment membrane . 144 Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2011 ) 28 : 137 – 155 123 Multiple cell junction components were differentially phosphorylated on serine , threonine or tyrosine early dur - ing the EMT process , 24 h after initiation of EMT by addition of exogenous TGF b . We performed phosphopep - tide selection of iTRAQ labeled peptides by titanium dioxide ( TiO 2 ) afﬁnity selection followed by LC - tandem MS . Four hundred ninety - six individual phosphopeptides were identiﬁed using a 95 % conﬁdence threshold ( Sup - plementary Table S4 ) . EMT modulation of phosphosite usage was assessed by Wilcoxon signed rank ( P \ 0 . 05 ) . d - catenin ( CTNND1 ) showed increased phosphorylation on S230 , S349 and S352 . The propeller protein AHNAK , known to participate in cell – cell junction formation through a complex with annexin A2 , actin and S100A10 , showed increased phosphorylation on S5448 and S5752 , decreased phosphorylation of S5731 . AHNAK homolog AHNAK2 was signiﬁcantly increased on S857 and epiplakin ( EPPK1 ) was increased on S3227 . These data suggest the hypothesis that increased serine phosphoryla - tion on these cytoskeletal / junction proteins , whose abun - dance will eventually be markedly decreased through EMT , may promote protein turnover and / or complex dis - assembly . The network approach used here highlights the marked attenuation of tight , adherens and desmosomal junction components , polarity organizing complexes and changes in adhesion signals in multiple EMT models . Extracellular matrix remodeling and migratory motor systems acquired through EMT We considered what new adhesive and cytoskeletal struc - tures would compensate for the loss of epithelial cell – cell junctions , to mitigate anoikis .

Systems decreased or lost with EMT included tight junctions ( TJ ) , adherens junctions ( AJ ) , desmosomal junctions ( DJ ) and adhesion to basement membrane ( BM ) . Systems increased with EMT included myosin motor coupling with intermediate ﬁlament and actin cytoskeletal assemblies , proteases responsible for BM degrada - tion and extracellular matrix remodeling , and integrin / cadherin switching allowing new adhesion signals . Components in green were attenuated during EMT while those in light brown / red were increased with EMT Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2011 ) 28 : 137 – 155 145 123 signaling . In the H358 EMT models integrin switching to a 5 b 1 and autocrine ﬁbronectin ( FN ) secretion was observed and activation of this integrin complex is con - sistent with increased tyrosine phosphorylation on PTK2 / FAK , paxillin and p130CAS ( see below ) . In addition there are many changes to the content of the extracellular matrix surrounding tumor cells . For example , versican ( VCAN ) , a matrix proteoglycan containing chondroitin sulfate acts to promote hyaluronan matrix assembly [ 71 ] and associates with lumican . Both versican and lumican were increased in the three metastable H358 models . Further markedly increased synthesis of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins collagen 14A1 and 5A2 , tenacin C , THBS1 , SPARC and ﬁbronectin were noted . The presence of basement membrane provides a stiff physical barrier which impedes tumor cell invasion . As part of the EMT process tumor cells increase the production of proteases that are able to degrade the surrounding basement membrane . The observed increased abundance of the metalloproteinases MMP14 ( MT1 ) , MMP9 and ADAM - TS1 contribute to proteolytic cascades leading to basement membrane ( BM ) destruction and tumor cell invasion . In addition , multiple negative regulators of invasion and migration were coordinately down regulated , including CD9 , BCAN and maspin ( SERPINB5 ) . Increased N - cad - herin ( CDH2 ) and its associated protein BOC was observed together with cadherin - 11 ( CDH11 ) , consistent with cad - herin switching from E - to N - cadherin early in EMT [ 72 ] . Taken together these observations support the notion that as part of the genetic reprogramming during EMT tumor cells switch to a pro - invasive / migratory phenotype an essential component of the metastatic program . In addition to these changes driving an invasive pheno - type , numerous changes in proteins involved in cellular motility were observed . TGF b and Snail mediated EMT in the H358 background were found to increase cell inva - siveness and motility in both scratch and Boyden chamber assays ( P \ 0 . 0005 ; Supplementary Fig . S7 and [ 64 ] ) , therefore we examined system gains which might contribute to motility . Microtubule myosin components MYH10 , MYL9 , and MYLK together with associated proteins TPM1 and CALD1 were increased in the mesenchymal state , linking actin and intermediate ﬁlaments with myosin motors in a manner consistent with the acquisition of cell motility and characteristic of myoﬁbroblasts . Decreased epithelial myosin MYO5C was observed . L - plastin is an actin ﬁlament protein expressed in ﬁbroblast ﬁlapodia , where phosphory - lation of S5 increases actin binding . Early in TGF b mediated EMT phosphorylation of S5 and S257 are increased , which would activate and recruit L - plastin to an assembling actin cytoskeleton . S5 is a likely target of PKA [ 73 ] . Prominin - 2 , like prominin - 1 ( CD133 ) a cancer stem cell marker , appears to play a role in plasma membrane protrusions [ 74 ] . Phosphorylation of a serine core ( S114 – S118 ) in prominin - 2 is increased early in TGF b EMT . Taken together these data suggest a coupling of myosin , intermediate and actin ﬁlaments in EMT mediated motility . Attenuation of autocrine EGFR family , Met family and IGF1R signaling networks with EMT Our previous worked showed that EMT can promote resis - tance to EGFR and IGF1R tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) in multiple carcinoma types [ 27 , 31 ] . Conﬁrming these ﬁndings we observed : ( 1 ) EGFR , and IGF1R tyrosine phosphorylation was markedly attenuated in the mesen - chymal state ( Fig . 4a , b ) ; ( 2 ) EGF family ligand expression was attenuated ( Supplementary Table S5 ; [ 25 ] ) ; ( 3 ) ErbB3 , the preferred phosphatidyl inositol - 3 0 kinase recruiting partner for EGFR and ErbB2 , was transcriptionally silenced ( Fig . 4a , Supplementary Table S5 ) ; ( 4 ) EGFR total protein abundance was unchanged regardless of EMT state ( Sup - plementary Table S5 ) . As mesenchymal cells are insensitive to EGFR inhibition we asked whether EGFR function was impaired in the mesenchymal state . EGF stimulated SHC and CBL tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by selec - tive pharmacological EGFR inhibition in both epithelial and ﬁxed - state mesenchymal lines ( Fig . 4c ) , while a phosphor - ylation control HSPD1 was unaffected . These data indicate EGFR is functional and can respond to exogenous ligand in both epithelial and mesenchymal states , but is only auto - crine activated in the epithelial state , contributing to EGFR onco - addiction in cells with an epithelial phenotype . This extensive dataset allowed us to gain further insight into the lack of EGFR dependency in the mesenchymal like state . For example diverse regulators of EGFR function such as NKD2 , required for export of TGF a to the cell surface subsequent to proteolytic release and EGFR binding [ 71 ] , were decreased during EMT . Similarly LRIG , which directly interacts with and negatively regulates EGFR sig - naling [ 75 ] and receptor - type tyrosine - protein phosphatase kappa ( PTPRK ) that dephosphorylates and inactivates EGFR signaling [ 76 ] were both increased . Together with the observed attenuation of EGF - family ligand synthesis , these changes in direct EGFR regulators would further reduce EGFR activity in the mesenchymal state . Interestingly , both Met and Ron receptor tyrosine kinases , which bind the ligands HGF and MSP , respec - tively and are associated with increased cell migration and metastasis , were decreased in expression and phosphoty - rosine content in cells with mesenchymal - like phenotype ( Fig . 4a ; Supplementary Table S5 ) . The attenuation of phosphotyrosine - dependent signaling through Met , Ron , EGFR , ErbB2 , ErbB3 and IGF1R were conﬁrmed by blot e . l . i . s . a . and quantitation of the chemi - luminescent signal ( P \ 0 . 01 ; Fig . 4b ) . Downstream signaling nodes were 146 Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2011 ) 28 : 137 – 155 123 co - attenuated with the EMT - mediated reduction in Met , Ron , EGFR and IGF1R kinase activation . These included multiple SH2 , cytoplasmic kinase and ubiquinylation adapters : pSHC , pGrb2 , pGAB1 , pPTK6 ( Brk ) , pUBB , pUBIQ and pNCKAP1 . We asked whether attenuated Met phosphorylation might be attributable to reduced HGF binding to Met . While no change in HGF transcript abun - dance was observed , ST14 ( matriptase ) , an extracellular protease which promotes proHGF activation , was markedly reduced .

Attenuated IL4R , Muc1 and Muc4 and integrin a 6 b 4 components also were observed . b Attenuated RTK tyrosine phosphorylation in H292 and H358 , ( epithelial phenotype ) Calu6 and H1703 ( mesenchymal phenotype ) cell models were conﬁrmed by quantitation of RTK arrays . c EGFR is functional and responds to exogenous ligand in both epithelial and mesenchymal states . H292 and H358 , ( epithelial ) Calu6 and H1703 ( mesenchymal ) cells were exposed to EGFR kinase inhibitor ( 3 l M erlotinib , 2 h ) or DMSO control prior to stimulation with exogenous EGF ( 10 ng / ml , 10 min ) . The EGFR - dependent inhibition of substrates CBL and SHC were similar in epithelial and mesenchymal - like cells , relative for control HSPD1 Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2011 ) 28 : 137 – 155 147 123 activity , also were attenuated . Paradoxically while EGFR family , IGF1R and Met signaling can promote EMT , once transitions occur , signaling from these RTKs is attenuated . These data suggest that , like EGFR and IGF1R , Met and Ron play roles early in invasion and migration and are not required for maintenance of a mesenchymal - like cell state in multiple NSCLC models . These observations raise the question as to why mes - enchymal - like tumor cells simultaneously reduce signaling through EGFR family , IGF1R and Met RTK networks , normally important factors for epithelial tissue mainte - nance . We have shown that the EGFR signaling apparatus is still intact and can respond to exogenous EGF . A cor - ollary of these data is that , in vivo , paracrine activation of EGFR , and possibly IGF1R and Met kinase activities are still enabled . We propose that autocrine to paracrine switching allows for chemotactic sensing of growth factor and cytokine gradients important to invasion . Evidence for this has been presented in a number of published studies . For example EMT - derived cells can migrate away from the tumor mass by chemotactic signaling with recruited mac - rophages [ 77 ] . Tumor cells provide paracrine CSF1 while recruited tumor associated macrophages secrete EGF family ligands , whose gradient allows migrational direction [ 10 ] . In this case tumor cells with autocrine EGFR sig - naling would be incapable of EGF - mediated directional chemotaxis , a deﬁcit alleviated by EMT - like transition . Another question that arises from these ﬁndings is what is promoting cell survival and preventing anoikis or senescence , in the absence of EGFR family , IGF1R , Met and Ron signaling , important survival networks for normal epithelium ? We focused on acquired mesenchymal sig - naling through distinct networks not observed in epithelial backgrounds . EMT acquired survival networks Six major clusters indicating gains of autocrine pathway activation in mesenchymal - like NSCLC models were observed ( Fig . 5a ) : IL11 and IL6 mediated gp130 - JAK activation ; Gas6 mediated Axl and Tyro3 activation ; ﬁbronectin - mediated a 5 b 1 - integrin activation ; TGF b - and BMP1 - mediated receptor signaling ; and autocrine FGFR and PDGFR networks were acquired in an EMT dependent manner . In addition , multiple direct and indirect modula - tors of cell survival were altered by EMT state . The cytokine cascades stemming from inﬂammation of the tumor micro - environment play a key role in cancer progression and EMT [ 7 , 10 , 77 ] . Among the pro - inﬂam - matory cytokines unregulated during EMT in the described models , IL6 and IL11 were of particular interest . IL6 was observed to increase during EMT in the H358 - Snail and Zeb1 models but not in response to TGF b stimulation ( Supplementary Table S5 ) . In contrast IL - 11 was observed to increase in all three of the H358 based EMT models ( Supplementary Table S5 ) . These cytokines are ligands for a family of receptors which couple through IL6ST / gp130 to signal through the JAK / STAT3 pathway to induce gene expression programs . Of interest , we also observe small increases in the receptors for these cytokines IL6R and IL6ST ( gp130 ) ( Supplementary Table S5 ) in the Snail and Zeb1 models . The production of these cytokines and increased expression of their receptors may have implica - tions for both autocrine and paracrine signaling mecha - nisms . Both IL6 and IL11 [ 78 ] have been shown to induce pro - migratory and pro - invasive phenotypes on cancer cells and so it can be hypothesized that the increased expression of these cytokines during EMT can contribute to the invasive nature of mesenchymal - like tumor cells [ 79 ] . In addition , as both of these cytokines can activate the JAK / STAT signaling pathways it provides a potential mecha - nistic explanation for the observed resistance of mesen - chymal - like tumor cells to chemotherapeutic and molecular targeted therapies . Interestingly , increased IL - 6 dependent signaling has recently been reported to provide resistance to EGFR targeted therapy [ 80 ] with the IL - 6 production being linked to TGF b - mediated EMT [ 81 ] . Taken together these observations suggest that up regulation of IL6 and IL11 production in cancer cells as they undergo EMT is linked to a pro - metastatic , tumor progressive phenotype . A further understanding of the effects of these cytokines on tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment will lead to the identiﬁcation of potential routes of therapeutic inter - vention . These data suggest dual EGFR / JAK - STAT tar - geting would be required for optimal therapeutic outcome in metastatic NSCLC with autocrine IL6ST - JAK - STAT signaling . The production of these cytokines can also inﬂuence the tumor microenvironment in a paracrine fashion leading to enhanced tumor progression . IL6 and IL11 can inﬂuence the biology of lymphocytes , macrophages , hematopoeitic cells , endothelial cells and osteoclasts [ 82 ] . Of particular interest is the impact on osteoclasts , whereby IL11 signaling can induce bone resorption leading to a metastatic niche within bone amenable for tumor cell growth . Indeed , breast cancers expressing high levels of IL11 show an enhanced level of bone metastasis compared to those patients whose tumors express lower levels of IL11 [ 83 ] . Multiple cytokine regu - lators were altered with EMT state , including SIGIRR ( TIR8 ) , an IL1R / Toll - like receptor family member , func - tions as a negative regulator of inﬂammation [ 84 ] . SIGIRR was down regulated in all three H358 EMT models can contribute to the aberrant increase inﬂammatory cytokines in the mesenchymal state . Urocortin 2 ( UCR2 ) , a hypoxia inducible ligand for the corticotrophin receptor with anti - angiogenic properties [ 85 ] was increased in metastable 148 Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2011 ) 28 : 137 – 155 123 EMT . Opposing this function , multiple pro - angiogenic proteins were increased , notably angiopoietin - 1 ( ANGPT1 ) , co - expression of thrombospondins together with the ADAMTS1 protease [ 86 ] and VEGF - C . Multiple receptor protein kinase networks were acti - vated in the mesenchymal state . Autocrine Gas6 stimula - tion of Axl and Tyro3 activity were established from array and RT - PCR RNA abundance measurements . The data suggest inhibitors of Axl and Tyro3 activity may show utility in limiting the survival of shed mesenchymal - like NSCLC cells . A functional role of autocrine Axl - Gas6 expression in lung [ 87 ] and breast cancer [ 88 ] progression has been established . Autocrine activation of FGFR and PDGFR signaling also was observed in both established ( H1703 ) and metastable TGF b models , supporting previous ﬁndings [ 25 , 89 ] . This increase in kinase activity and PDGFR autophosphorylation was associated with increased PDGFR and PDGF RNA transcripts . In meta - stable Snail and Zeb1 models , FGFR1 and PDGFR tran - scripts were markedly increased , PDGF was modestly increased and FGF1 was unchanged or slightly decreased ( Supplementary Table S5 ) . These data support the predic - tion of kinase activation by autocrine co - expression of receptor – ligand transcripts .

Increased signaling through IL - 11 / IL - 6 / gp130 , TGF b / BMP2 , Axl / Tyro3 , integrin a 5 b 1 , PDGFR and FGFR were observed . Downstream activation of BRAF / MAPK1 and PTK2 / paxillin signaling were observed . Components in green were attenuated during EMT while those in light brown / red were increased with EMT . b Activating MAPK1 / Erk phosphorylation ( T185 / Y187 ) , associated with TGF b - induced EMT , was conﬁrmed by immunoblot Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2011 ) 28 : 137 – 155 149 123 consequence PDGFR and FGFR exerted in the multiple model systems . While pharmacological inhibition of PDGFR or FGFR elicited a marked decrease in H1703 proliferation [ 25 , 89 ] , inhibition of PDGFR or FGFR had little or no activity in the metastable models , despite ini - tiation of autocrine activation ( data not shown ) . These data suggest cellular onco - addiction to active PDGFR and FGFR networks is a trait selected for relatively late fol - lowing EMT and that PDGFR and FGFR networks are not required for either the EMT transition itself or for imme - diate survival following EMT . The activation of TGF b R signaling is a physiologically relevant and frequent pro - moter of EMT in many model systems . Increased tran - scription of TGF b 1 , 2 and 3 as well as increased levels of TGF b receptors 1 , 2 and BMP receptor 2 were observed . This was associated with activating phosphorylation of Erk but not Akt ( Fig . 5a , b ) . However both Snail and Zeb1 metastable models were insensitive to TGF b R inhibition ( data not shown ) , again suggesting cellular dependence on TGF b signaling may be a trait selected for relatively late following EMT or restricted to TGF b - initiated EMT . As described earlier , H358 / TGF b cells markedly upregu - lated expression of the ﬁbronectin receptor integrin a 5 b 1 together with autocrine ﬁbronectin expression . Autocrine integrin a 5 b 1 activation was also observed in the committed mesenchymal - like lines H460 ( data not shown ) and subclones oftheH292line ( datanot shown ) supportingitsprominencein both metastable and ﬁxed mesenchymal states . In the H358 / TGF b model autocrine integrin activation accompanied tyrosine phosphorylation of PTK2 ( FAK ) , paxillin , BCAR1 ( p130CAS ) linking this complex to the ﬁlamin A , ﬁlamin B components of the focal adhesion - actin cytoskeleton . The BCAR binding adapter protein SH2D3A , a component of the PTK2 / paxillin / actin complex , showed increased phosphory - lation on S125 in the metastable TGF b model . Resistance to chemotherapy - induced apoptosis is a characteristic of mesenchymal - like tumors and lines [ 21 , 22 ] . Prohibitins - 1 and - 2 were increased with EMT ( Sup - plementary Table S5 ) and have been shown to displace 14 – 3 – 3 from raf to allow ras localization and activation [ 90 ] . In this regard , increased Erk phosphorylation on the activation loop was common in both the metastable H358 ( Fig . 5b ) and ﬁxed state models . Both Erk / 2MAPK1 and p38 / MAPK14 showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation in the H358 / TGF b model ( Supplementary Table S5 ) , consistent with increased phosphorylation of Y187 for MAPK1 ( Supplementary Table S9 ) and enzyme activation . The down regulation of PKN1 ( in all H358 models ) and subsequent reduction in the phosphorylation of TRAF2 may relieve negative control over both NFkB and p38 / JNK pathways . Activation of p38 a / MAPK14 and p38IP have been shown to be required for EMT during mouse gas - trulation [ 91 ] . While cross correlation of individual protein and gene changes between fractions and experiments increases the conﬁdence in quantitation , the combined measurement of system components unequivocally estab - lish reorganization of receptor protein kinase and integrin complexes during EMT . EMT - associated transcription nodes and alternative splicing We asked whether subsets of changes observed in mesen - chymal - like phenotypes could be correlated with speciﬁc transcription components . We used pathway analysis to build networks in two ways . Firstly , we built out from EMT modulated transcription factors to modulated genes and in a second complementary approach in from EMT modulated genes back to proposed transcription nodes . The identiﬁed EMT transcription nodes included NFkB2 / RelA , ATF3 / ATF2 , Myc , FOXA1 / FOXA2 , ETS1 , NFE2L2 / L3 , MEF2C , Snail / Slug [ 45 , 92 ] and Zeb1 / Zeb2 [ 93 , 94 ] . These networks are outlined in Fig . 6a , b . The loss of FOXA1 and FOXA2 was recently been shown to result in the loss of E - cadherin ( CDH1 ) and were required for EMT in pancreas cancer cells in vitro [ 95 ] . Snail is reported to be a critical regulator of EMT and was readily identiﬁed as a node in our analysis . The levels of Snail itself were increased in the EMT models , as were factors reported which inﬂuence its stability and activity . The serine - threonine kinases PAK1 , PAK2 and the lysyl oxidases ( LOX , LOXL1 and LOXL2 ) , which partici - pate to enhance Snail stability [ 96 ] , were increased in mes - enchymal - like NSCLC cells . The dephosphorylation ( - 2 . 2 log2 ) of GSK3 a / b on the activating site Y279 also may contribute to PAK activation and Snail stabilization associ - ated with EMT . Supporting this hypothesis , phosphorylation of PAK2 on S141 , an activating phosphorylation site [ 97 ] , appeared increased in TGF b mediated EMT ( 1 . 5 log2 ) and increased Snail transcripts were observed in TGF b and Zeb1 models . Finally HDAC7 cytoplasmic - nuclear localization is regulated by phosphorylation on S486 by PKD or CAMK and recruitment of 14 – 3 – 3 proteins . In TGF b induced EMT this site is hypophosphorylated , which would lead to nuclear localization and repression of target genes . In addition to transcriptional reprogramming it is clear that mRNA splicing can change the repertoire of proteins synthesized during EMT . Published examples of this include the alternative splicing of FGFR and ENAH ( Mena ) that generate proteins with different functional consequences in epithelial compared to mesenchymal cells [ 46 ] . A relatively large cluster of 24 proteins associated with RNA maturation , alternative splicing and RNA export were increased , con - tributing to post - transcriptional RNA processing associated with the mesenchymal phenotype and may be functionally linked to focal adhesion complex changes [ 98 ] . In contrast , mesenchymal cells demonstrated a marked decrease in the 150 Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2011 ) 28 : 137 – 155 123 splicing factors RBM35A ( ESRP1 ) , RBM35B ( ESRP2 ) , RBM47 , STAU2 and STRBP . Of note , RBM35A and RBM35B are required for the epithelial splice form of FGFR1 and FGFR2 , known to be alternatively spliced between EMT states [ 46 ] and where the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR shows gain of function . Cell stress and metabolism The previous sections have indicated that during metastable EMT , cells have exchanged proliferative potential for migratory capability . We asked what metabolic changes might be associated with this reduction in replicative stress Fig . 6 a The transcription node regulating interferon response was modulated during EMT . a Reduced free radical scavenging capacity was correlated the mesenchymal state , associated with the NFE2L2 transcription node . Components in green were attenuated during EMT while those in light brown / red were increased with EMT . b Networks regulated during EMT associated with FOXA , Snail , Zeb , ATF , NFKB / Rel , MEF2and Myc transcription nodes Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2011 ) 28 : 137 – 155 151 123 and the reduced need for macromolecular biosynthesis . Three functional metabolic groups were modulated by EMT : ( 1 ) the redox - stress pathway was markedly reduced in capacity ; ( 2 ) the glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways appeared down and up regulated , respectively ; and ( 3 ) the prostaglandin / prostacyclin pathway was upregulated . Altered metabolism of cancer cells often leads to the excess production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) which are scavenged in part by the glutathione and thioredoxin pathways [ 99 ] . Induction of ROS scavenger pathways has been associated with resistance to chemotherapeutic agents which increase free radical production . As mesenchymal tumor cells show relative resistance to multiple classes of chemotherapy , the consistent reduction in the abundance of seventeen members of the ROS scavenger pathway was unexpected ( Fig . 6a ) . Notably glutathione S - transferase ( GSTP1 / O1 ) , perioredoxin ( PRDX2 / 5 ) and thioredoxin ( TXN ) were all attenuated . ROS stress sensing is regulated in part by phosphorylation and nuclear import / export of the Cap’n’collar proteins NFE2L2 / L3 which bind to antioxidant response elements within target genes . DNA binding is modulated by multiple proteins upregulated by EMT ( FOSL2 , ATF3 , ARNTL , PHB and PHB2 ) [ 100 ] . NFE2L2 family activation of anti - oxidant genes is negatively regu - lated by the dominant negative Cap’n’collar protein BACH1 . BACH1 was increased with metastable EMT and would block NFE2L2 / L3 - mediated increases in redox stress gene expression . Glutathione synthesis genes also can be regulated by the Myc transcription factor . The decreased abundance of redox stress pathway components indicate reduced activation of NFE2L2 / L3 transcription and / or Myc pathways in both metastable and ﬁxed state models . This ﬁnding is of interest since redox stress can promote EMT - like transitions [ 101 ] , but once EMT has occurred , the activation of free radical induced genes do not appear crit - ical to a maintenance of the mesenchymal state . Intersecting DNA damage cellular stress pathways were similarly decreased with EMT . Histone H2AX , a marker of DNA repair , is phosphorylated on both S139 and Y142 . The dephosphorylation of Y142 is associated with response to DNA damage [ 102 , 103 ] . In both ﬁxed and metastable models H2AX and H2AZ showed increased phosphotyro - sine content in the mesenchymal state , indicative of a reduction in the sensing of DNA damage . While GADD45 b was up regulated in the three metastable mod - els , taken together the data suggest the GADD45 b increase may reﬂect cell cycle delay rather than DNA damage response . A coordinate reduction in DNA damage response and redox stress pathway components was associated with a mesenchymal - like cell state . The shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis and increased biosynthesis is a hallmark of cancer [ 104 ] . In turn oxidative stress leads to an excess in ROS production and an up regulation of glutathione / thioredoxin scavenger capacity . Through EMT a decrease in ROS inducible genes was observed . We also observed a reduction in the abundance of the glycolytic HK2 , PFK , FBP1 , PKM2 , ME1 , GLUD1 and in glutamate / non - essential amino acid transporters SLC1A1 and the CD98 / 4F2 complex ( SLC7A5 and SLC3A2 ) , indicative of reduced glycolytic capacity and reduced oxidative stress . In contrast , mitochondrial complex I , III and V components NADH dehydrogenase ( NDUA9 ) , Ubiquinol - cytochrome c reductase ( UCRC ) and ATP syn - thase subunits 5B / 5C1 / 5D were increased with transition to a more mesenchymal - like phenotype . Seven members of the amino acid metabolism / urea cycle pathway were coordi - nately decreased during EMT , including CKB , GATM , GLUD1 and GLUD2 , OAT , PRODH , and SAT1 . EMT also resulted in a reduction in transcripts encoding fatty acid synthase ( FASN ) and fatty acid hydroxylase ( FA2H ) , sug - gesting reduced synthesis of palmitate and hydroxy - spin - golipids . Taken together these data suggest EMT shifts cellular metabolism to reduce glycolytic capacity , reduce oxidative stress and limit fatty acid synthesis . Prostaglandin / prostacyclin metabolism was modulated by EMT state in a manner consistent with increased pros - taglandin H2 and prostacyclin availability . The cyclooxy - genase PTGS2 ( COX - 2 ) was increased while carbonyl reductase was decreased , which together would increase the abundance of the pro - inﬂammatory cytokine PGE2 . However offsetting decreases in prostaglandin E synthases - 1 and - 3 would increase prostaglandin H2 and prostacyclin abundance . An inﬂammatory microenvironment and ele - vated COX - 2 have been correlated with increased EMT - like transitions [ 9 , 105 ] . Conclusions Here we have developed and extensively analysed a number of models of the EMT process that reﬂect multiple different stages of the transition . It is clear from these studies that analsyes of a single model system by a single methodology give only a limited insight into the EMT process as a whole . For this reason we undertook a more extensive systems biology approach to analyze both inducible models of EMT in an isogenic background as well as epigenetically ﬁxed cancer cell lines of both epi - thelial and mesenchymal phenotypes . From these analyses it is clear that there are a number of recurring common themes in the types of transcriptional and protein regula - tory changes that are observed during EMT . These include marked changes in the repertoire of cell – cell junctional proteins , increases in pro - invasive and pro - migratory pro - teins , changes in the ﬂux through metabolic pathways and a change in the repertoire of secreted cytokines that modify 152 Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2011 ) 28 : 137 – 155 123 the tumor microenvironment . All of these changes are controlled through the actions of a number of critical transcription factors and the networks of factors that they induce . Epithelial mesenchymal transitions resulted in marked changes to cellular survival signaling and metabolic net - works . A shift from EGFR , IGF1R and Met / Ron activated signaling networks to a new repertoire of autocrine survival networks was clear . These included autocrine IL11 / IL6 - gp130 / JAK2 / STAT , ﬁbronectin - integrin , GAS6 - Axl / Tyro3 , PDGFR / FGFR / RET and TGF b R networks , often in a het - erogeneous cell - speciﬁc manner . Preliminary evidence suggest a model where initial dependence on IL11 / IL6 - JAK / STAT , TGF b R and / or ﬁbronectin - integrin signaling in the early metastable state , gives way to later cell selection and onco - addiction to Axl , Tyro3 , PDGFR , FGFR or RET networks in the epigenetically - ﬁxed sarcoma - like state where tumor cells can both proliferate and migrate . The reductions in oxidative and redox stress networks with EMT were unexpected and suggest new strategies may be required to effectively exploit cancer metabolism in epi - thelial , metastable and ﬁxed - mesenchymal states . The measured changes in survival and metabolic networks pro - vide new opportunities to pharmacologically target both epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cell states , important to reduce cancer progression and recurrence . These network changes can be functionally elucidated by systematic large scale shRNAi screening for EMT phenotype and mesen - chymal cell survival .
