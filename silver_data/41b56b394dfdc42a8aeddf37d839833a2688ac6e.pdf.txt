The structural basis for Golgi compartment localization was analyzed by confocal microscopy of HeLa cells expressing various PKC (cid:2) – green ﬂuorescent protein fusion proteins costained with the Golgi compartment – speciﬁc markers p24 and p230 . Deletions of either the NH 2 - terminal hydrophobic or the cysteine region , but not of the pleckstrin homology or the acidic domain , of PKC (cid:2) completely abrogated Golgi localization of PKC (cid:2) . As an NH 2 - terminal PKC (cid:2) fragment was colocalized with p24 , this region of PKC (cid:2) is essential and sufﬁcient to mediate association with Golgi membranes . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching studies conﬁrmed W the constitutive , rapid recruitment of cytosolic PKC (cid:2) to , and stable association with , the Golgi compartment independent of activation loop phosphorylation . Kinase activity is not required for Golgi complex targeting , as evident from microscopical and cell fractionation studies with kinase - dead PKC (cid:2) found to be exclusively located at intracellular membranes . We propose a sequential activation process of PKC (cid:2) , in which Golgi compartment recruitment precedes and is essential for activation loop phoshorylation ( serines 738 / 742 ) by a transacting kinase , followed by auto - and transphosphorylation of NH 2 - terminal serine ( s ) in the regulatory domain . PKC (cid:2) activation loop phosphorylation is indispensable for substrate phosphorylation and thus PKC (cid:2) function at the Golgi compartment . Introduction The PKCs comprise a family of intracellular serine / threonine kinases which are expressed in a cell type – specific pattern . PKCs have been shown to be involved in signal transduction of a wide range of biological responses including changes in cell morphology , proliferation , and differentiation ( Toker , 1998 ; Black , 2000 ) . Typically , PKCs are lipid - activated ki - nases that can be distinguished by different lipid - dependent activation modes . Two novel lipid - activated kinases , sharing significant homology to PKCs as well as to calmodulin - dependent ki - nases were identified in man and mouse and named PKC (cid:2) ( Johannes et al . , 1994 ) and PKD ( Valverde et al . , 1994 ) , respectively . PKC homologies reside particularly in the NH 2 - terminal cysteine - rich zinc finger region , comprising the structural basis for lipid - mediated activation and the COOH - terminal kinase domain which exerts even closer homologies to the calmodulin kinases . However , PKC (cid:2) / PKD differ from the three major groups of PKC isozymes by the presence of a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) * domain within the regulatory region ( Gibson et al . , 1994 ) , an acidic domain ( Gschwendt et al . , 1997 ) , and an NH 2 - terminal hydrophobic region . A PKC - typical pseudosubstrate site could not be identified . More recent work reported on novel PKC (cid:2) / PKD - related isotypes termed PKC (cid:3) ( Hayashi et al . , 1999 ) and PKD2 ( Sturany et al . , 2001 ) , together defining a novel PKC - like kinase family . PKC (cid:2) is ubiquitously expressed and apparently involved in diverse cellular functions , probably in a cell type – specific manner . For example , PKC (cid:2) shows particularly high ex - pression in thymus and hematopoietic cells , suggesting a potential role in immune functions ( Rennecke et al . , 1996 ; Address correspondence to Dr . F . J . Johannes , Institute of Cell Biology and Immunology , Allmandring 31 , 70569 Stuttgart , Germany . Tel . : ( 49 ) 711685 - 6995 . Fax : ( 49 ) 711685 - 7484 .

In accordance with these studies is the finding that PKC (cid:2) is recruited together with the tyro - sine kinase Syk and phospholipase C (cid:4) to the B cell receptor complex upon B cell receptor stimulation and negatively regulates PLC (cid:4) activity ( Sidorenko et al . , 1996 ) . Our previ - ous studies further suggested a function in antiapoptotic sig - naling ( Johannes et al . , 1998 ) . Probably the most intriguing finding is the Golgi compartment localization of PKC (cid:2) and involvement in constitutive transport processes in epithelial cells ( Prestle et al . , 1996 ) . Indeed , very recent data point to a fundamental importance of PKC (cid:2) in G protein – mediated regulation of Golgi organization ( Jamora et al . , 1999 ) and initiation of vesicular transport processes at the TGN ( Lil - jedahl et al . , 2001 ) . In accordance with cell type – specific functions , PKC (cid:2) / PKD location and activation appears to differ in different cell types and may involve different upstream regulators , in - cluding conventional PKCs ( Zugaza et al . , 1996 ; Matthews et al . , 2000b ) . For example , PKD activation by exogenous stimuli is mediated via a PKC - dependent pathway in murine mast cells and B cells ( Matthews et al . , 2000b ) . Localization studies in the lymphocytic cell line A20 indicated a revers - ible , antigen receptor – triggered membrane translocation in - dependent of the PKD PH domain ( Matthews et al . , 2000a ) . We have performed the present study to analyze in detail structural requirements for constitutive PKC (cid:2) localization at the Golgi compartment using the epithelial - derived HeLa cell line . We show that the NH 2 - terminal domain is essen - tial for localization of PKC (cid:2) at the Golgi compartment and that intrinsic kinase activity is not necessary for this localiza - tion . Golgi complex attachment of PKC (cid:2) is required for phosphorylation of activation loop serines 738 / 742 and sub - sequent NH 2 - terminal phosphorylation at different serines . Overexpression of PKC (cid:2) – green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) mutants comprised of the Golgi localization domains only or of a kinase - dead variant , both acting as dominant nega - tive inhibitors of endogenous PKC (cid:2) function , severely af - fected PKC (cid:2) localization , showing in addition to Golgi lo - calization a localization in / at vesicle - like structures . Results Characterization of PKC (cid:2) – GFP expression constructs To analyze cellular localization of PKC (cid:2) in living cells , a set of plasmids was constructed expressing PKC (cid:2) mutants as COOH - terminal GFP fusion proteins . The mutants used in this study are schematically shown in Fig . 1 ( for de - tails see Materials and methods ) . Mutants were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells to check expression by Western blot analyses and activity pattern by in vitro autophos - phorylation of PKC (cid:2) immunoprecipitates ( Fig . 2 ) . GFP - tagged wild - type PKC (cid:2) and the kinase - dead PKC (cid:2) K612W - GFP mutant migrated with the expected relative molecular weight of (cid:2) 140 kD ( Fig . 2 , top ) , showing either basal au - tophosphorylation ( wild - type ) or a complete lack of kinase activity ( PKC (cid:2) K612W - GFP , Fig . 2 , bottom ) as shown previ - ously for wild - type PKC (cid:2) and the K612W kinase - dead mutant ( Johannes et al . , 1998 ) . Several deletion mutants lacking either the PH domain ( PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) PH - GFP ) , the cys - teine finger region ( PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) CI - GFP , PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) CII - GFP , PKC - (cid:2) (cid:5) CRD - GFP ) , or the acidic region ( PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) AD - GFP ) were expressed and analyzed in the same way by immunoprecip - itation and autophosphorylation ( Fig . 2 ) . Interestingly , de - letion of the acidic domain , which was predicted to be in - volved in regulation of PKC (cid:2) kinase activity ( Gschwendt et al . , 1997 ) , resulted in enhancement of constitutive ki - nase activity , which was similar to that shown for the PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) PH - GFP mutant ( Fig . 2 , bottom ) . Deletion of each of the cysteine fingers ( Cys1 : H147 - C196 , Cys2 : H271 - C320 ) or both did not affect PKC (cid:2) kinase activity ( Fig . 2 , bottom ) . NH 2 - terminal deletion mutants lacking either the first 78 amino acids , representing the hydrophobic re - gion ( PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) 1 – 78 - GFP ) , or the 340 NH 2 - terminal amino Figure 1 . Schematic view of the PKC (cid:2) - GFP mutants used in this study . The hydrophobic region ( amino acids M1 – D86 ) and the cysteine - rich region ( CI and CII ; amino acids H147 – C196 and amino acids H271 – C320 ) are located in the NH 2 - terminal domain of PKC (cid:2) . The PH domain ( V409 – T552 ) is located between CII and the COOH - terminal kinase domain . PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) PH - GFP lacks the PH domain , whereas PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) CI - GFP and PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) CII - GFP lack the first or the second cysteine - rich region . In PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) CRD - GFP both cysteine rich regions were deleted . PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) 1 – 78 - GFP lacks the hydrophobic region ( M1 - R78 ) , whereas PKC (cid:2) 1 – 86 - GFP contains only the hydro - phobic regions of wild - type PKC (cid:2) . PKC (cid:2) 1 – 325 - GFP consists of 325 NH 2 - terminal amino acids . PKC (cid:2) PH contains the PH domain ( V409 – T552 ) . The acidic domain includes amino acids E336 – D391 . All mutants used in this study were expressed as COOH - terminal GFP fusion proteins as schematically indicated . Deleted domains are indicated by dashed lines . Phosphorylatable serine residues are indicated in wild - type PKC (cid:2) - GFP . AD , acidic domain ; CRD , cysteine - rich domain ; WT , wild - type . K612W indicates a point mutation in the ATP - binding site . PKC (cid:2) structure and Golgi localization | Hausser et al . 67 acids ( PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) 1 – 340 - GFP ) , largely covering the zinc - finger region , were constructed and analyzed for protein expres - sion as well as for kinase activity . PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) 1 – 78 - GFP dis - played a weak reduction in autophosphorylation efficiency , whereas enzyme activity of PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) 1 – 340 - GFP was compara - ble to wild - type kinase activity ( Fig . 2 , bottom ) . As a control for localization and phosphorylation studies , the PH domain and the NH 2 - terminal domain ( amino acids 1 – 325 ) were each separately expressed as a GFP fusion protein . As expected , these fragments , which lack the ki - nase domain , showed no autophosphorylation ( Fig . 2 , right lane , top and bottom ; see Fig . 6 A ) . Identification of the binding domain mediating Golgi membrane association of PKC (cid:2) To specify determinants and functional activities relevant for subcellular localization , wild - type PKC (cid:2) - GFP and kinase - dead PKC (cid:2) K612W - GFP were expressed in HeLa cells and an - alyzed by confocal microscopy . For PKC (cid:2) - GFP a diffuse signal was revealed throughout the cell , but a clear enrich - ment in perinuclear structures was noted ( Fig . 3 A , top rows ) . Staining of endogenous PKC (cid:2) in HEK293 cells with PKC (cid:2) - specific antibodies verified that the PKC (cid:2) - GFP fu - sion protein does not differ in localization from endogenous PKC (cid:2) ( Fig . 3 D ) . These data are in accordance with previ - ous studies ( Prestle et al . , 1996 ; Liljedahl et al . , 2001 ) . As a Golgi compartment – specific marker served p24 , a vesicle and Golgi compartment – associated protein ( Gommel et al . , 1999 ) . P24 appeared perinuclear and in vesicular structures throughout the cell ( Fig . 3 , middle ) . Partial colocalization of PKC (cid:2) - GFP with p24 - positive compartments was verified by overlay ( Fig . 3 A , right ) . Further , costaining with anti - bodies specific for p230 ( Kjer - Nielsen et al . , 1999 ) and GM130 ( unpublished data ) , independent markers of the trans - and cis Golgi network , respectively , verified Golgi compartment association of PKC (cid:2) ( Fig . 3 A ) . Interestingly , kinase - dead PKC (cid:2) K612W - GFP , although still partially colo - calized with the Golgi markers at a perinuclear region , was found in structures dispersed throughout the cell with ap - pearance of long tubuli and large vesicular structures ( Fig . 3 A , see enlargements ) . Of note , these PKC (cid:2) - positive struc - tures did no longer costain with any of the three applied Golgi markers ( Fig . 3 A , right ) . Overexpression of a PKC (cid:2) mutant lacking kinase activity was shown recently to disrupt normal Golgi morphology , pointing to an essential role of kinase activity in maintaining Golgi structure ( Liljedahl et al . , 2001 ) . Further corroborat - ing this finding , we can show that not only expression of a kinase - dead PKC (cid:2) K612W - GFP , but also of the Golgi binding NH 2 - terminal fragment PKC (cid:2) 1 – 325 - GFP provoked changes in normal PKC (cid:2) localization , with signs of tubulation and / or large vesicle formation of PKC (cid:2) - positive structures ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) , suggesting a dominant negative action of both constructs on endogenous wild - type PKC (cid:2) . Using PKC (cid:2) K612W - GFP , we analyzed whether the observed mor - phological changes and segregation of PKC (cid:2) from p24 - pos - itive structures might also be associated with a relocation of PKC (cid:2) to different membrane compartments or other intra - cellular structures . Costaining of PKC (cid:2) K612W - GFP with var - ious vesicular markers was analyzed . To this end , we could not detect any colocalization with EEA - 1 , Rab5 , and Rab8 as endosomal markers . Furthermore , no colocalization with TGN38 , BIP , Caveolin - 1 , Clathrin , or Lamp1 was detect - able ( unpublished data ) . Although PH domains are frequently responsible for membrane association ( Falasca et al . , 1998 ) , the deletion mutant of PKC (cid:2) showed no apparent differences in intra - cellular localization from the wild - type , and Golgi struc - ture appeared normal ( Fig . 3 B ) . Moreover , analysis of the isolated PH domain expressed as a GFP fusion protein ( PKC (cid:2) PH - GFP ) revealed complete segregation from p24 staining and cytosolic / nuclear location ( Fig . 3 B ) . Contrary to the expectations , these data show that the PH domain is apparently not required for PKC (cid:2) association with the Golgi compartment . Likewise , a deletion of the acidic do - main of PKC (cid:2) ( PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) AD - GFP ) displayed enhanced basal kinase activity ( Fig . 2 ) and did not interfere with Golgi compartment localization of PKC (cid:2) ( Fig . 3 B ) . Together , these data suggest that the PH and the acidic domain play a role in negative regulation of kinase activity rather than in localization . The deletion of NH 2 - terminal regions affected Golgi compartment localization of PKC (cid:2) . As shown in Fig . 3 C , expression of PKC (cid:2) - GFP mutants lacking either 78 ( PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) 1 – 78 - GFP ) or 340 ( PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) 1 – 340 - GFP ) NH 2 - terminal amino acids led to a complete cytosolic distribution of PKC (cid:2) . No colocalization with p24 - staining structures was detectable ( Fig . 3 C ) . Deletion of the complete kinase do - main did not affect Golgi compartment localization ( unpub - lished data ) . An NH 2 - terminal PKC (cid:2) fragment ( PKC (cid:2) 1 – 86 - GFP ) was found to be located completely in the cytosol , Figure 2 . Expression and in vitro phosphorylation of PKC (cid:2) - GFP fusion proteins . HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated constructs . 40 h after transfection cells were lysed and PKC (cid:2) - GFP was immunoprecipitated using an anti - GFP antibody and subjected to Western blotting ( top ) and in vitro autophosphorylation ( bottom ) . Shown are autoradiographs after overnight exposition . 68 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 156 , Number 1 , 2002 whereas the entire NH 2 - terminal region covering both cys - teine fingers ( PKC (cid:2) 1 – 325 - GFP ) showed partial colocalization with p24 staining structures ( Fig . 3 C ) . These data already suggest that the NH 2 - terminal hydrophobic region itself is not sufficient , but might be required in concert with the cys - teine - rich domains to mediate Golgi complex association of PKC (cid:2) . The supposed important role of the cysteine - rich re - gion was verified by expressing the respective deletion mu - tants . Deletion of either the second cysteine finger ( PKC (cid:2) - (cid:5) CII - GFP ) or the complete cysteine rich region ( PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) CRD - GFP ) ; each resulted in cytosolic and nuclear distribution . In the case of PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) CI - GFP , an exclusive nuclear localization was detected ( Fig . 3 C ) . These data identify the NH 2 - termi - nal hydrophobic domain and the adjacent zinc finger re - gions , together covering amino acids 1 – 325 , as the Golgi compartment binding domain of PKC (cid:2) and demonstrate that intrinsic PKC (cid:2) kinase activity is not required for associ - ation with Golgi membranes . Activation loop phosphorylation of PKC (cid:2) requires localization at the Golgi compartment The data described above show the importance of the PKC (cid:2) NH 2 - terminal region for Golgi complex localization . As ki - nase - dead mutants of PKC (cid:2) - GFP remain associated with Golgi region ( Fig . 3 A ) and other intracellular membranes ( Liljedahl et al . , 2001 ) , and complete inhibition of kinase activity of wild - type PKC (cid:2) - GFP by H89 did not result in a relocation to the cytosol ( unpublished data ) , it appears that autophosphorylation is not required for membrane recruit - ment of PKC (cid:2) . However , as upstream kinases appear to be involved in PKC (cid:2) activation , it was necessary to analyze in detail individual phosphorylation sites in PKC (cid:2) with re - Figure 3 . Subcellular localization of PKC (cid:2) - GFP mutants . The indicated PKC (cid:2) - GFP mutants were transiently expressed in HeLa cells and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . 40 h after transfection cells were fixed and stained for p24 or p230 with an anti - p24 rabbit antiserum or an anti - p230 monoclonal antibody followed by an incubation with Alexa 546 – labeled anti – rabbit or anti – mouse antibodies . In - tact cell morphology was controlled by transmission light microscopy . PKC (cid:2) - GFP ( green ) and p24 / p230 ( red ) stains were combined ( right ) .

PKC (cid:2) structure and Golgi localization | Hausser et al . 69 spect to their role in Golgi localization and activation of the kinase . To correlate localization with the phosphorylation state , the various PKC (cid:2) - GFP constructs used in this study were expressed in HEK293 cells and monitored for expression level as well as for in vivo PKC (cid:2) phosphorylation using PKC (cid:2) phosphosite – specific antibodies . As expected , consti - tutive PKC (cid:2) kinase activity was detected by pSer 910 - specific antibodies ( Fig . 4 A , middle ) . As a negative control , PKC (cid:2) K612W - GFP was included . No autophosphorylation was detectable with pSer 910 antibodies . The pSer 738 / 742 anti - body detected the PKC (cid:2) K612W - GFP mutant , pointing to PKC (cid:2) kinase independent , constitutive phosphorylation of this site by an upstream kinase . Deletion mutants of the PH domain , the acidic region , or deletions of either the first , second , or both cysteine - rich re - gions showed phosphorylation of Ser 910 . As the NH 2 - termi - nal deletion mutants are cytosolic , while the former two are Golgi bound ( Fig . 3 ) , Ser 910 autophosphorylation appears localization independent . In contrast , only the PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) PH - GFP and the PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) AD - GFP mutant exerted significant phosphorylation at Ser 738 / 742 ( Fig . 4 A , bottom ) , whereas de - letion mutants localized in the cytosol or in the nucleus show only weak phosphorylation at Ser 738 / 742 . Five phosphorylation sites in PKC (cid:2) / PKD have been described recently ( Vertommen et al . , 2000 ) . As well as three phosphorylation sites in the COOH - terminal re - gion , two phosphorylation sites at Ser 205 ( equivalent with Ser 203 in PKD ) and Ser 249 ( Ser 255 in PKD ) were reported . The NH 2 - terminal phosphorylation sites are likely to contribute to PKC (cid:2) activation and / or regulation of PKC (cid:2) . Figure 4 . Localization of PKC (cid:2) - GFP at the Golgi compartment is required for phosphorylation of serines 738 / 742 . ( A ) Differential phosphorylation of PKC (cid:2) - GFP deletion mutants . HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids . Expression of the fusion proteins was monitored by Western blot analysis using an anti - GFP antibody .

( B ) Characterization of PKC (cid:2) - GFP phosphorylation mutants . ( C ) PKC (cid:2) S738 / 742A - GFP colocalizes with the Golgi compartment – specific marker p24 . ( D ) PKC (cid:2) - GFP with phosphorylated activation loop is exclusively recovered in the organelle fraction . HEK293 cells were transfected with PKC (cid:2) - GFP or PKC (cid:2) K612W - GFP and separated into soluble proteins from organelles structures sedimenting at 100 , 000 g . Western blot analysis was performed by anti - GFP or phosphorylation - specific antibodies . 70 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 156 , Number 1 , 2002 To further determine phosphorylation - dependent influ - ence on Golgi complex localization of PKC (cid:2) , all predicted phosphorylation sites ( Ser 910 , Ser 738 / 742 , Ser 249 , Ser 205 ) were mutated to alanine and characterized for activation loop and COOH terminal phosphorylation . As shown in Fig . 4 B by Western blot analysis using phosphoserine - specific antibod - ies , mutations of NH 2 - terminal serine residues ( S205A ; S249A ) did not influence phosphorylation sites on Ser 738 / 742 or Ser 910 . Mutants of either Ser 738 / 742 or Ser 910 did effect de - tection by the respective antibodies , but did not influence other phosphorylation sites . Mutants were further analyzed for intracellular colocalization with p24 . As shown for the Ser 738 / 742 Ala double mutation , Golgi complex localization ( Fig . 4 C ) was not affected , indicating that phosphorylation of these activation loop sites is not a prerequisite for Golgi complex localization , but instead suggests that activation loop phosphorylation requires Golgi complex localization of PKC (cid:2) . All other phosphorylation site mutants analyzed showed similar localization as wild - type PKC (cid:2) - GFP ( un - published data ) . In addition , intracellular distribution of PKC (cid:2) - GFP and PKC (cid:2) K612W - GFP was analyzed by biochemical methods . As shown in Fig . 4 D , after separation of soluble proteins from organelles and structures phosphorylation of PKC (cid:2) in the activation loop was exclusively recovered in the organelle fraction , whereas PKC (cid:2) was recovered in both fractions ( Fig . 4 D ) . Phosphorylation of Ser 910 was not affected by in - tracellular localization of PKC (cid:2) , as cytosolic and particular fractions contain approximately equal amounts of this phos - phorylated species of PKC (cid:2) . Golgi region – localized PKC (cid:2) is recruited from the cytosolic pool and is independent of activation loop phosphorylation . As shown by FRAP experiments ( Fig . 5 ) , cytosolic PKC (cid:2) - GFP and PKC (cid:2) S738 / 742A - GFP rapidly translocate to the Golgi region . Upon bleaching of Golgi region – localized PKC (cid:2) - GFP and PKC (cid:2) S738 / 742A - GFP within the circled area ( Fig . 5 A , right ) , specific GFP fluorescence disappears leaving only the cytosolic and vesicular pool of PKC (cid:2) within the cell ( Fig . 5 A , middle ) . Within a 15 - min period , cytosolic PKC (cid:2) - GFP and PKC (cid:2) S738 / 742A - GFP are rapidly recruited to the Golgi region ( Fig . 5 A , right ) . As illustrated in Fig . 5 B by the reverse experiment , i . e . , bleaching of cytosolic PKC (cid:2) - GFP and PKC (cid:2) S738 / 742A - GFP , re - spectively , a decay of Golgi region – specific PKC (cid:2) - GFP and PKC (cid:2) S738 / 742A - GFP staining was found ( Fig . 5 B ) . Interestingly , in addition to an assumed cytosolic redistribution , which can - not be readily detected because of dilution of the fluorescence signal , we observed a redistribution of PKC (cid:2) - GFP , in particu - late structures out of the defined region ( Fig . 5 B , enlarge - ments ) . Of note , no difference between wild - type and activa - tion loop mutant PKC (cid:2) - GFP was observed . These data clearly indicate a translocation of cytosolic PKC (cid:2) to the Golgi region independent of its activation loop phosphorylation and point to a constitutive attachment of PKC (cid:2) to Golgi membranes . NH 2 - terminal phosphorylation is a consequence of activation loop phosphorylation of PKC (cid:2) at the Golgi compartment The above studies already suggested a multistep process of PKC (cid:2) activation with auto - and transphosphorylation events for the COOH - terminal – located phosphorylation sites . To decipher the sequence of phosphorylation events leading to activation and regulation of PKC (cid:2) , we estab - lished an in vitro transphosphorylation assay using several NH 2 - terminal PKC (cid:2) domains expressed as GFP fusion pro - teins as substrates for PKC (cid:2) - GFP . As shown in Fig . 6 A , the PKC (cid:2) 1 – 325 - GFP domain could be efficiently phosphorylated by PKC (cid:2) - GFP , whereas the PKC (cid:2) 1 – 86 - GFP domain , as well as the PKC (cid:2) PH - GFP domain , were not phosphorylated by PKC (cid:2) - GFP . According to published data , the phosphoryla - tion site was predicted to be Ser 205 within the 14 - 3 - 3 bind - ing site ( Hausser et al . , 1999 ) or Ser 249 predicted to be phos - phorylated by an upstream kinase ( Vertommen et al . , 2000 ) . To further analyze whether the above - described NH 2 - ter - minal homologous transphosphorylation occurs in intact cells , PKC (cid:2) 1 – 325 was coexpressed with wild - type or mutated PKC (cid:2) - GFP and analyzed by shift assays indicative of poten - Figure 5 . Constitutive recruitment of PKC (cid:2) S738 / 742A - GFP to the Golgi compartment .

Pictures were taken after the indicated times shown in the middle and right panels . ( B ) Constitutive association of PKC (cid:2) - GFP with the Golgi compartment and membrane structures . Fluorescence outside of the marked region indicated in the prebleach image was elimi - nated by photobleaching . Note that the fluorescence intensity of PKC (cid:2) - GFP at the Golgi region is saturated in all of the images to allow visualization of less bright structures .

As shown by West - ern blot analysis ( Fig . 6 B ) , coexpression of PKC (cid:2) 1 – 325 to - gether with PKC (cid:2) - GFP led to the appearance of two bands at the expected size of the fragment . The slower migrating band of PKC (cid:2) 1 – 325 represents the phosphorylated protein which is evident from coexpression of PKC (cid:2) 1 – 325 with kinase - dead PKC (cid:2) K612W - GFP , where only the faster migrating band ap - peared ( Fig . 6 B , top ) . Conversely , coexpression of constitu - tively active PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) PH - GFP led to the exclusive appearance of the slower migrating band , indicating strong transphosphory - lation of the NH 2 - terminal fragment . Interestingly , coexpres - sion of PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) CRD - GFP did not result in phosphorylation of PKC (cid:2) 1 – 325 . As shown above , this mutant lacks the Golgi lo - calization domain and is therefore not phosphorylated at the activation loop Ser 738 / 742 . Accordingly , these findings suggest a stepwise activation by phosphorylation of Ser 910 and Ser 738 / 742 followed by NH 2 - terminal phosphorylation of PKC (cid:2) . To confirm this sequential phosphorylation process , mu - tations in known phosphorylation sites ( S205A , S249A , S738 / S742A , S910A ) were introduced in PKC (cid:2) - GFP , ex - pressed , and analyzed by kinase assay for auto / trans - and substrate phosphorylation . Immunoprecipitates of PKC (cid:2) S738 / 742A - GFP did not show detectable aldolase - or PKC (cid:2) 1 – 325 - GFP phosphorylation , whereas in the case of all other mu - tants , auto - and substrate phosphorylation was not affected ( Fig . 6 C ) . These data indicate that activation loop phos - phorylation on Ser 738 / 742 is essential for transphosphorylation of NH 2 - terminal residues . Discussion In this study , we analyzed the structural basis for Golgi com - partment localization of PKC (cid:2) in epithelial cells . Using a set of deletion mutants we can show by confocal microscopy Figure 6 . In vitro transphosphorylation of NH 2 - terminal PKC (cid:2) domains .

( C ) Ser 738 / 742 activation loop phosphorylation is essential for NH 2 - terminal transphosphorylation . Wild - type PKC (cid:2) and the indicated mutants were expressed as GFP fusion proteins , immuno - precipitated , and subjected to in vitro kinase assays measuring either auto - , aldolase , or phosphorylation of PKC (cid:2) 1 – 325 - GFP ( top ) . Expression of the PKC (cid:2) - GFP mutants was measured by Western blot analysis using an anti - GFP antibody ( bottom ) . 72 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 156 , Number 1 , 2002 that NH 2 - terminal residues covering amino acids 1 – 325 constitute the Golgi compartment localization domain . Moreover , we show that phosphorylation of PKC (cid:2) is not re - quired for binding to Golgi membranes but rather that phos - phorylation of Ser 738 / 742 requires Golgi localization . Our data further suggest a sequence of events in which transphos - phorylation of NH 2 - terminal epitopes occurs subsequent to activation loop phosphorylation , whereas autophosphoryla - tion at Ser 910 is independent of localization and of phosphor - ylation of the activation loop . The findings presented in this study are illustrated in a model shown in Fig . 7 . PKC (cid:2) is comprised of several structural domains which are putatively able to mediate membrane interactions , such as a hydrophobic NH 2 terminus and two cysteine - rich zinc finger regions , highly conserved among PKC members and shown to be involved in Golgi compartment localization of PKC (cid:6) ( Lehel et al . , 1995 ) , as well as a PH domain consid - ered to mediate membrane association of proteins via bind - ing to phosphatidylinositol phosphate ( Harlan et al . , 1994 ) . Biochemical studies have recently shown that the hydropho - bic region of PKD does not function as a genuine trans - membrane domain ( Jamora et al . , 1999 ) , which is under - lined by our studies showing that the expression of the human homologous fragment does not , on its own , localize to membranes . However , the analysis of the various NH 2 - terminal deletion mutants of PKC (cid:2) provide direct evidence that this region is , in concert with both zinc fingers involved in Golgi compartment localization of PKC (cid:2) , whereas the PH domain , unexpected from its functional relevance for PKC (cid:2) activation at the Golgi complex , is not involved . The functional importance of the NH 2 - terminal region is further stressed by Golgi complex localization of overexpressed PKC (cid:2) 1 – 325 - GFP , resulting in a similar appearance of vesicu - lar structures as expression of kinase - dead PKC (cid:2) ( Fig . 3 ) . This points to a dominant negative effect of this mutant by competition with endogenous PKC (cid:2) for binding to Golgi membranes and thus negatively affecting structure and po - tential functions in Golgi complex ( Liljedahl et al . , 2001 ) . The simultaneous requirement of the three subdomains within the NH 2 - terminal regulatory region for PKC (cid:2) asso - ciation with Golgi membranes points to the need for multi - ple interactions . In addition to potential hydrophobic inter - actions via the NH 2 terminus and lipid messenger binding to the zinc finger regions , protein – protein interactions of this PKC (cid:2) domain with integral or associated Golgi mem - brane proteins are likely to be involved . Although these Golgi membrane interaction partners of PKC (cid:2) have to be identified in further studies , the NH 2 - terminal region is al - ready known to serve as a binding domain for regulatory proteins . For example , 14 - 3 - 3 proteins can bind to PKC (cid:2) and negatively regulate its kinase activity ( Hausser et al . , 1999 ) . Other proteins , such as the tyrosine kinase Btk and lipid PI4 - and PI4 - 5 kinases , were also shown to be associ - ated with PKC (cid:2) via the NH 2 - terminal region ( Nishikawa et al . , 1998 ; Johannes et al . , 1999 ) . As the PI4 - 5 kinase does not associate with kinase - dead PKC (cid:2) , a role of phosphoryla - tion - triggering association with this target protein was pre - dicted ( Nishikawa et al . , 1998 ) . From the studies presented here , for PKC (cid:2) binding to the Golgi region , an essential role of phosphorylation is ruled out , as evident e . g . , from Golgi membrane localization of kinase - dead , kinase do - main – deficient , and activation loop – deficient PKC (cid:2) . Ac - cordingly , a role of PI4 - 5 kinase in serving as a Golgi region receptor of PKC (cid:2) appears very unlikely . The PKC (cid:2) PH domain does not contribute to the local - ization at Golgi membranes . As deletion resulted in consti - tutive kinase activity , these data support a specific regulatory function of this domain ( Iglesias and Rozengurt , 1998 ; Hausser et al . , 2001 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . Of note , the PH domain has been shown to mediate the interaction with PKC (cid:7) , which is thought to play a role in PKC (cid:2) activation ( Waldron et al . , 1999 ) . The participation of the PH domain of the murine PKC (cid:2) homologue , PKD , in function at the Golgi region during G - protein signaling events has been demonstrated previously ( Jamora et al . , 1999 ) . Our data clearly indicate that the PKC (cid:2) PH domain serves a regulatory function , probably by coupling to upstream pathways and , in contrast to classical PH domains , does not mediate membrane local - ization . Our data also shed light on the sequence of events leading to activation of PKC (cid:2) . We provide evidence that activation of PKC (cid:2) is a complex process involving auto - and trans - Figure 7 . Model of recruitment to and activation of PKC (cid:2) at the Golgi compartment . PKC (cid:2) structure and Golgi localization | Hausser et al . 73 phosphorylation events at Ser 910 and Ser 738 / 742 , respectively , followed by phosphorylation of NH 2 - terminal residues . The role of the NH 2 - terminal phosphorylation is currently un - clear . As it is performed through a homologous transphos - phorylation event by activated PKC (cid:2) ( Fig . 6 ) its function might be in the generation of phosphoepitopes mediating the binding of regulatory proteins such as 14 - 3 - 3 ( Hausser et al . , 1999 ) or of potential substrates such as PI kinases ( Nishikawa et al . , 1998 ) . Within the domain between amino acids 200 – 250 a clustering of potential phosphorylation sites are located ( 12xSer , 4xThr ) . Therefore , it presently cannot be excluded that , dependent on the cellular context , differ - ent residues might be phosphorylated and thus may differ - entially influence activity of PKC (cid:2) . As cellularly expressed kinase - dead PKC (cid:2) is phosphory - lated on Ser 738 / 742 , these sides can be considered as trans - phosphorylation sites for an upstream kinase . This reasoning is supported by H89 inhibition of PKC (cid:2) kinase , demonstrat - ing selective inhibition of phosphorylation of Ser 910 and not of Ser 738 / 742 ( unpublished data ) . Therefore , our data point to an H89 - insensitive upstream kinase . According to published data and our own observations , PKC (cid:2) is activated by up - stream PKCs ( Zugaza et al . , 1996 ) . PKC (cid:7) and also PKC (cid:6) were recently implicated in PKD activation ( Waldron et al . , 1999 ) . PKC (cid:6) has been located at the Golgi compartment and a role in Golgi region – specific functions was suggested previously ( Lehel et al . , 1995 ) . The data presented here are in accordance with a participation of PKC (cid:6) in Golgi region functions via activation of PKC (cid:2) . In support of this , Golgi region localization domain mutants did not show phosphor - ylation on Ser 738 / 742 ( Fig . 4 A ) . On the other hand , activa - tion loop mutants , similarly to wild - type PKC (cid:2) , were local - ized at the Golgi region ( Fig . 4 C ) . This reemphasizes a phosphorylation - independent localization of PKC (cid:2) at the Golgi region and suggests PKC (cid:6) as a candidate for an up - stream kinase for activation loop phosphorylation of PKC (cid:2) at the Golgi compartment . Materials and methods Plasmid constructs and cell lines cDNA constructs containing wild - type and various mutant PKC (cid:2) se - quences in the pCDNA3 mammalian expression vector have been de - scribed previously ( PKC (cid:2) K612W , PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) 1 – 78 , PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) 1 – 340 , PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) AD , and PKC - (cid:2) (cid:5) PH ) ( Johannes et al . , 1998 , 1999 ) . Deletion of the CI motif , amino acids H147 – C196 ( PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) CI ) ; the CII motif , amino acids H271 – C320 ( PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) CII ) ; and the combination of both motifs ( PKC (cid:2) (cid:5) CRD ) were generated by an over - lap PCR using Taq - polymerase ( MBI Fermentas ) . Site - specific mutations within PKC (cid:2) - GFP resulting in single amino acids substitutions ( S205A , S249A , S738 / 742A , S910A ) were performed by a PCR approach using the QuickChange site - directed mutagenesis system ( Stratagene ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The integrity of the PCR - amplified plas - mids were verified by sequencing . Fig . 1 shows a scheme of the different mutants used in this study . The GFP - tagged wild - type and mutant PKC (cid:2) expression plasmids were obtained by subcloning the respective PKC (cid:2) coding sequence into the EcoRI - BamHI sites of the polylinker of the pEGFP - N1 vector from CLONTECH Laboratories , Inc . HeLa and HEK293 ( American Type Culture Collection ) were cultured in RPMI medium sup - plemented with 5 % FCS . Antibodies and reagents Antibodies directed against phosphoSer 916 and phosphoSer 744 / 748 of PKD were purchased from NEB / Cell Signaling . p24 - specific antibodies were provided by F . Wieland ( University of Heidelberg , Heidelberg , Germany ) . Anti - GFP antibodies were obtained from Roche Diagnostics . Anti - p230 and anti - GM130 antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laborato - ries . Anti - PKC (cid:2) rabbit antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnol - ogy , Inc . Secondary alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG and goat anti - rabbit IgG antibodies were purchased from Dianova or Sigma - Aldrich . The Alexa 546 – conjugated goat anti – rabbit and anti – mouse antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes . Protease - and phosphatase inhibitors were from Biomol . HEK293 and HeLa cell transfections HEK293 and HeLa cells were maintained at 37 (cid:8) C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere in RPMI medium supplemented with 5 % FCS . The day before transfection , HEK293 cells were seeded at 3 (cid:9) 10 5 cells per well in a 6 - well plate ( for in vitro kinase assays and Western blot ) . HeLa cells were seeded at 5 (cid:9) 10 4 cells on glass coverslips ( for immunofluorescence microscopy ) . DNA transfections ( 2 (cid:2) g plasmid DNA per 3 (cid:9) 10 5 cells and 1 (cid:2) g plasmid DNA per 5 (cid:9) 10 4 cells ) were performed using Superfect reagent ( QIAGEN ) ac - cording to the manufacturer’s instructions . In brief , appropriate DNA amounts were mixed with the Superfect reagent , incubated at room tem - perature for 10 min in order to allow the complex to form , and then di - rectly added to the culture medium . 2 – 3 h later , cells were transferred to fresh RPMI supplemented medium and incubated for further 40 h at 37 (cid:8) C . Immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assays HeLa and HEK293 cells transiently expressing the indicated PKC (cid:2) - GFP mutants were lysed at 4 (cid:8) C in lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris / HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 1 % Tri - ton X - 100 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM NaF , 1 mM sodium ortho - vanadate , 10 (cid:2) g / ml leupeptin , 0 . 5 mM PMSF ) . After 30 min cell lysis , the lysates were centrifuged ( 10 , 000 g , 15 min , 4 (cid:8) C ) , the supernatant was col - lected , and immunoprecipitation of GFP fusion proteins was performed with 400 ng of anti - GFP antibody . After a 1 . 5 - h incubation at 4 (cid:8) C , 30 (cid:2) l of protein G sepharose was added and the mixture was incubated at 4 (cid:8) C for 1 h . The sepharose pellet was then washed two times in lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT ) and PKC (cid:2) activity ( as measured by auto - and substrate phosphorylation ) was determined by incubating immunocomplexes with 10 (cid:2) l of kinase buffer containing 2 (cid:2) Ci [ (cid:4) - 32 P ] - ATP with or without 5 (cid:2) g aldolase at 37 (cid:8) C for 15 min . Reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 (cid:9) SDS - PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS - PAGE , Western blotting , and autoradiogra - phy . Autoradiographs were analyzed by quantitative phosphoimage analy - sis ( Molecular Dynamics ) . Western blot analysis For Western blot analysis , transfected HEK293 cells were treated as de - scribed in the figure legends before being lysed in 200 (cid:2) l lysis buffer fol - lowed by boiling with 5 (cid:9) SDS - PAGE sample buffer . Equal amounts of pro - tein were loaded on a 12 . 5 % SDS - PAGE . Upon fractionation , proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane ( Schleicher & Schuell ) . Membranes were blocked , followed by incubation either with a mono - clonal antibody against GFP ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) , a mouse antiserum raised against the NH 2 - terminal region of PKC (cid:2) ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) , or the rabbit antibodies phosphoSer744 / 748 and phosphoSer916 ( both 1 : 500 ) . Membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase – conjugated anti – mouse IgG or anti – rabbit IgG antibodies ( 1 : 5 , 000 ) . Immunoblots were developed according to standard procedures . For separation of soluble proteins from organelles 4 (cid:9) 10 6 HEK293 cells were transfected with 20 (cid:2) g of pEGFP - N1 - PKC (cid:2) or pEGFP - N1 - PKC (cid:2) K612W and 100 (cid:2) l Superfect reagent ( QIAGEN ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . 40 h after transfection , cells were harvested and resuspended in 500 (cid:2) l lysis buffer without Triton X - 100 . Homogenization was done by applying 20 strokes with a “very tight fitting” 5 - ml Dounce homogenizator ( Braun ) . To remove cellular debris , the cellular extract was centrifuged at 1000 g followed by centrifugation of the supernatant for 1 h at 100 000 g ( TLA 100 ; Beckman Coulter ) . Soluble proteins were recovered in the su - pernatant , whereas organelles and structures were recovered in the pellet . The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer . For Western blot analysis equal amounts of protein were loaded onto a 12 . 5 % SDS - PAGE . Confocal immunofluorescence analysis HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips and expressing the indicated GFP - tagged PKC (cid:2) mutants were washed once in PBS and fixed in 3 . 5 % paraformaldehyde ( pH 7 . 4 ) for 20 min at 37 (cid:8) C . Fixed cells were blocked and permeabilized in 5 % normal goat serum and 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 for 30 min at room temperature . Coverslips were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the p24 rabbit antibody ( 1 : 200 ) or the p230 mouse anti - body ( 1 : 200 ) . Coverslips were washed three times in PBS and incubated with an anti – rabbit or an anti – mouse IgG Alexa 546 – labeled antibody 74 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 156 , Number 1 , 2002 ( 1 : 500 ) for 1 . 5 h at room temperature . Cells were washed three times in PBS and mounted in Fluormount G ( Dianova ) . Images were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope ( TCS SP2 ; Leica ) equipped with a 63 (cid:9) / 1 . 4 HCX PlanAPO oil immersion objective . GFP was excited with an argon laser ( 488 - nm line ) , whereas Alexa 546 was excited with a helium - neon laser ( 543 - nm line ) . Each image represents a two - dimensional paral - lel projection of sections in the Z - series taken at 0 . 5 – 1 - (cid:2) m intervals across the depth of the cell . Selective photobleaching was performed on the Leica TCS SP2 using 80 consecutive scans with a 488 - nm laser line at full power . Live cells were held at 37 (cid:8) C and 5 % CO 2 atmosphere .
