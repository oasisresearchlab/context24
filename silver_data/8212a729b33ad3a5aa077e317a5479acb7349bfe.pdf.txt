Knowles : 11 July 1994 ; Accepted : 29 November 1994 ; Received at publishers : 9 January 1995 SUMMARY An expression system for Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Sc ) has been developed which , depending on the chosen vector , allows the constitutive expression of proteins at different levels over a range of three orders of magnitude and in different genetic backgrounds . The expression system is comprised of cassettes composed of a weak CYC1 promoter , the ADH promoter or the stronger TEF and GPD promoters , flanked by a cloning array and the CYC1 terminator . The multiple cloning array based on pBIISK ( Stratagene ) provides six to nine unique restriction sites , which facilitates the cloning of genes and allows for the directed cloning of cDNAs by the widely used ZAP system ( Stratagene ) . Expression cassettes were placed into both the centromeric and 2 ~ t plasmids of the pRS series Sikorski and Hieter , Genetics 122 ( 1989 ) 19 - 27 ; Christianson et al . , Gene 110 ( 1992 ) 119 - 122 containing HIS3 , TRPI , LEU2 or URA3 markers . The 32 expression vectors created by this strategy provide a powerful tool for the convenient cloning and the controlled expression of genes or cDNAs in nearly every genetic background of the currently used Sc strains . INTRODUCTION The unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Sc ) has become a popular model system for molecular biology . An increasing number of gene products from Sc shows a significant structural and / or functional similarity to those of humans and other higher eukaryotes . Many Correspondence to : Dr . M .

Furthermore , Sc is now widely used for studying the interaction of proteins from various organisms by the two - hybrid - system ( Fields and Song , 1989 ; Gyuris et al . , 1993 ; Harper et al . , 1993 ) . The analyses described above require the ectopic expression of genes or cDNAs at different levels under the control of heterologous promoters . Several expression vectors for yeast have been constructed for this purpose ( Rose and Broach , 1990 ) . Many of these vectors however suffer from certain disadvantages . They often do not pro - vide a cloning array with multiple restriction sites . Most of them are derivatives of the large pBR322 plasmid lack - ing the versatility of current E . coli vectors . In addition , many of the yeast expression vectors consist of individual vector backbones and cloning arrays . As a consequence the exchange of selectable markers genes , which may be desirable for the expression of several different proteins or for the use in different genetic backgrounds , is usually SSDI 0378 - 1119 ( 95 ) 00037 - 2 120 difficult . Furthermore these vectors are not ideally suitable for the comparison of transcription - level - dependent effects . In this paper , we describe a series of compact vectors designed for the convenient cloning of genes and their controlled expression at different levels . Expression levels can be manipulated by changing either the strength of transcription or the copy number of recombinant gene . Along these lines , we have established an expression system composed of several promoters of different strength , a multiple cloning array and a terminator from the CYC1 gene ( Zaret and Sherman , 1982 ) . These expres - sion cassettes were introduced into low ( CEN / ARS ) or high copy number ( 2p ) plasmids carrying one of the four different selection markers of the pRS - series of vectors ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ; Christianson et al . , 1992 ) . EXPERIMENTAL AND DISCUSSION ( a ) Construction of the vectors For the construction of a new series of yeast expression vectors , we chose four constitutive promoters of different strength derived from the genes encoding cytochrome - c oxidase ( CYC1 ; Guarente et al . , 1984 ) , alcohol dehydro - genase 1 ( ADH from the ADH1 gene ; the Hitzeman et al . , 1981 ) , translation elongation factor 10t ( TEF from the TEF2 gene ; Schirmaier and Philippsen , 1984 ; Nagashima et al . , 1986 ) and glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydroge - nase ( GPD ; Musti et al . , 1982 ; Bitter et al . , 1984 ) . The wild - type ADH promoter is active when cells are grown in glucose media but can be repressed 2 - 10 - fold on non - fermentable carbon sources ( Beier and Young , 1982 ; Denis et al . , 1983 ) . The truncated version of the CYC1 promoter generated here is very weak and no longer inducible due to a deletion of most of the UAS2 sequence ( Guarente et al . , 1984 ) . Promoters were cloned as PCR - generated SacI - XbaI fragments into a vector based on the plasmid pRS416 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) which already carried a PCR - generated XhoI - KpnI fragment of the CYCl - terminator ( Fig . 1 ) . From the resulting plasmids , termed p416prom , the different expression cassettes ( Fig . 1B ) were cloned into the centromeric and 21 x plasmids ( p41Xprom and p42Xprom ; Fig . 1A ) of the pRS series carrying a HIS3 , TRP1 , LEU2 or URA3 marker gene ( p4X3 , p4X4 , p4X5 or p4X6 in Fig . 1A ) . The MCS of these plasmids based on pBIISK ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA , USA ) provides 6 to 9 unique cloning sites depending on the plasmid back - bone ( Table I ) . This MCS allows the construction of cDNA libraries by the directional cloning of cDNAs gen - erated by the widely used ZAP system ( Stratagene ) .

( A ) Schematic map of the plasrnids . The nomenclature is based on the plasmids described by Christianson et al . ( 1992 ) . For example , plasmid p424ADH carries the ADH promoter and is based on pRS424 carrying the TRPI gene and the 2kt ori . Shown are the restriction sites of the MCS ( bold ) between the promoter ( arrow ) and the terminator . Unique sites depending on the plasmid backbone are shown in Table I . ( B ) Maps of the several promoters ( shaded boxes ) and the CYCI terminator ( striped box ) used for the expression cassettes . Numbers below the boxes represent the regions of the promoters in bp cloned by PCR relative to the start codon ( + 1 would be A of the ATG codon ) .

The XbaI site is only unique in the centrometric p41X vectors . The XhoI site is not unique in the p4XXCYC1 vectors ( see Fig . 1 ) . inserts carrying their own start codon will be expressed . In case a useful cloning site is not unique due to a second site in the marker gene , the insert can first be cloned into a vector lacking this site and then be transferred into the vector carrying the desired selectable marker gene . ( b ) Expression rates of the vectors In order to compare the expression rates achieved by the different vectors , a lacZ gene was cloned as a XbaI - BamH1 cassette downstream of the promoters in the plas - raids carrying the URA3 marker . The reporter constructs were transformed into the strain YPH499 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) and the 13 - galactosidase activity was deter - mined as described ( Ausubel et al . , 1991 ) . As can be seen in Fig . 2 , expression levels varied by approx , three orders of magnitudes , with the lowest level seen with the centro - meric CYC1 construct ( 0 . 9 units ) , and the highest level found with the 2 ~ t GPD construct ( 935 units ) . The expression levels obtained with centromeric and 2g vectors respectively , varied between 2 . 6 - fold for the CYCI promoter and 30 - fold for the ADH promoter . This roughly corresponds to the difference in copy number of 1 copy per cell for a centromeric plasmid and 10 - 30 copies per cell for a 2g plasmid , as determined for the pRS series of plasmids ( Christianson et al . , 1992 ) . The lower increase of expression observed with the GPD and TEF promoters ( fivefold ) in the 2g relative to the centro - meric plasmids might be due to insufficient levels of tran - scription factors in cells transformed with the high copy number 2g plasmids . In the case of the CYC1 promoter the complete lack of an UAS sequence might explain the relative low increase of expression from a 2 } a plasmid . Another strong advantage of the system presented here is based on the observation that all of the described vec - 1000 - 800 600 ~ 4 1 1 1 1 , 2 ~ 2 ~ , iln ¢ , , I e4 P4 expression vector Fig . 2 . Expression levels of the different vectors . The 13 - galactosidase activities of the promoter / lacZ fusions ( see Fig . 1 ) in the plasmids p416 or p426 were determined as described by Ausubel et al . ( 1991 ) . Values represent an average of five independent colonies tested . The standard deviation is given as a bar at the top of the columns . 121 tors show considerable levels of expression in E . coli ( data not shown ) . After cloning of cDNAs into these vectors , we frequently use this feature to check E . coli trans - formants for the expression of proteins of correct size by Western blotting . This is a convenient way to select appropriate clones for subsequent transformation into yeast cells . Comparison of the proteins made in Sc and E . coli often gives a first hint with respect to post - translational modifications . The moderate strength of expression from the yeast promoters in E . coli should not lead to a toxic effect observed for the strong over - expression of many eukaryotic sequences in E . coli . ( c ) Conclusions We have cloned a total of 32 yeast expression vectors that allow for the constitutive expression of heterologous proteins at various levels over a range of three orders of magnitude . The large multiple cloning array provides up to nine unique restriction sites for the convenient cloning of the desired genes or cDNAs . The different marker genes of the vectors facilitate the expression analysis in different genetic backgrounds . They also provide a pow - erful tool to study the co - expression in the same cell of up to four different genes at various levels . Cells carrying up to for different centromeric plasmids stably maintain the vectors and we did not observe recombination between the plasmids as well as interference between the promoters on expression level . Many of the vectors described here have already been used successfully in our lab for the over - expression and co - expression of several yeast transcription factors ( GCN4 , YAP1 and YAP2 ; M . F . and R . M . , data not shown ) and cell cycle genes ( SWI4 , SWI6 and G1 cyclins ; D . M . , M . F . and R . M . , data not shown ) . They also have been used for the heterologous expression of various murine and human cDNAs ( Sewing et al . , 1994 ) and fusion proteins ( Jooss et al . , 1994 ) . In addition , based on this vector system , we constructed a new series of plas - mids for the expression of proteins fused to the bacterial repressor LexA or the transactivation domain of the VP16 protein in a two hybrid system ( J . Zwicker , M . F . and R . M . , data not shown ) . We also generated analogous vectors that direct the expression of respective proteins with a N - terminal 9 - amino - acid - long epitope from the influenza virus HA protein , thus allowing for the simple detection of the expressed protein by a high affinity monoclonal antibody raised against the HA epitope which is commercially available ( Hiss Diagnostics ) .
