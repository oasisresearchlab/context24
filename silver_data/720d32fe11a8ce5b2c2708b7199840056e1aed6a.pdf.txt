Extending previous work by others ( Benard et al . , 1999 ; Firtel and Meili , 2000 ; Parent et al . , 1998 ; Zigmond Summary et al . , 1981 ) , we have begun to identify specific roles for the cellular signals and cytoskeletal assemblies that mediate asymmetric attractant sensitivity of neutrophils Likeneutrophilicleukocytes , differentiatedHL - 60cells ( Servant et al . , 2000 ; Srinivasan et al . , 2003 ; Wang et al . , respond to chemoattractant by adopting a polarized 2002 ; Weineretal . , 2002 ) .

The latter effect explains both the neutro - formation of actin polymers and pseudopods ( Servant phil’s ability to polarize in uniform concentrations of et al . , 2000 ; Wang et al . , 2002 ) , apparently by abrogating chemoattractant and its response to reversal of an activation of small GTPases of the Rho family , including Rac and Cdc42 ( Benard et al . , 1999 ) , which are known attractant gradient by performing a U - turn . to promote formation of actin polymers ( Ridley , 2001 ; Tapon and Hall , 1997 ) . We recently presented evidence ( Srinivasan et al . , * Correspondence : bourne @ cmp . ucsf . edu 6 These authors contributed equally to this work . 2003 ; Wang et al . , 2002 ; Weiner et al . , 2002 ) that PI3Ps Cell202 and Rac serve as signals in a positive feedback loop cells ( Servant et al . , 2000 ) , including polymerization of actin , activation of Rac and Cdc42 , and PI3P - dependent that organizes the leading edge of HL - 60 cells . While PI3Ps are required for activation of Rac , the reverse phosphorylation of the PI3P - dependent kinase PKB / Akt . Nonetheless , PTX - treated HL - 60 cells exhibited a is also true : inhibiting Rac activation ( with toxins or a dominant interfering Rac mutant ) prevents PI3P accu - distinctive response to a point source of the chemoat - tractant formyl - methionyl - leucine - phenylalanine ( fMLP ) , mulation ( Servant et al . , 2000 ; Srinivasan et al . , 2003 ; Wang et al . , 2002 ) . Moreover , addition of exogenous supplied by micropipette : instead of protruding a pseu - dopod toward the micropipette like normal cells , PTX - PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 can trigger the positive feedback loop di - rectly , initiating accumulation of endogenous PI3Ps treated cells developed at their up - gradient edges a well - defined uropod - like structure , well demarcated ( Weiner et al . , 2002 ) , morphologic polarity , and motility in the absence of added chemoattractant ( Niggli , 2000 ; from the weak ruffles seen on the cell’s down - gradient side ( Figure 1A ) .

Finally , we found ( Srinivasan et al . , 2003 ; Wang et al . , 2002 ) that Rac stimulates PI3P accu - pettes ( lacking fMLP ) produced no effect on morphol - ogy .

Results are normalized to the density of the RhoA band in the unstimulated lane ( (cid:4) 1 . 0 ) . ( C ) Effects of inhibitors on RhoA activity . HL - 60 cells were pretreated with PTX ( 1 (cid:3) g / ml , overnight ) , latrunculin B ( Lat B , 40 (cid:3) g ml (cid:5) 1 for 30 min ) , or LY 294002 ( LY , 200 (cid:3) M , 2 hr ) ; exposed to uniform fMLP ( 100 nM ) for 1 min ; and Rho activity was determined as described above . Results are normalized to the density of the RhoA band in the unstimulated lane ( (cid:4) 1 . 0 ) . ( D ) Effects of inhibitors on phosphorylation of Akt / PKB . HL - 60 cells were treated for 1 min with or without fMLP after exposure to the indicated inhibitors , as described above .

In living cells exposed to fMLP , morphologic polarity and accumulation of F - actin in (cid:1) 80 % of cells expressing a GFP - tagged version of a GFP - tagged RhoA fusion protein was excluded from pseudopods and redistributed to uropods ( see Supple - RhoA - Q63L ( Supplemental TableS1 ) ; instead , suchcells were round in shape and showed faint , irregular cortical mental Figure S1 online at http : / / www . cell . com / cgi / content / full / 114 / 2 / 201 / DC1 ) in (cid:1) 95 % of more than 50 staining for F - actin ( Figure 2B ) . Expression of untagged RhoA - Q63L similarly blocked the accumulation of PH - polarized cells examined . Akt - GFP , a fluorescent probe for PI3Ps that is normally seen in pseudopods of HL - 60 cells exposed to fMLP Rho Activation Inhibits Polarization and Motility Rho activation reportedly inhibits activation of Rac in ( Figure 2C ; Supplemental Table S1 ) .

Dominant - Positive Rho Mutants Abolish Cell Polarity and Migration ( A ) Differentiated HL - 60 cells plated on fibronectin - coated coverslips were untreated ( top ) or exposed for 2 min to a uniform concentration ( 100 nM ) of fMLP ( bottom ) . Cells were fixed and stained ( left ) , treated with detergent before fixation ( middle ) , or treated with streptolysin O ( SLO ) before fixation ( right ) . Fixation was performed by exposure to 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde , followed by staining with a specific anti - RhoA antibody ( green ) or Texas - red - labeled phalloidin ( red ) . For detergent and streptolysin O extractions , cells were immediately treated with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 on ice for 1 min or exposed to 5 U / ml streptolysin O for 10 min and then fixed and stained as described above . For details , see Experimental Procedures . ( B ) GFP - tagged RhoA - Q63L , a constitutively active Rho mutant , was transiently expressed in HL - 60 cells , which were then plated on coverslips coated with 0 . 1 mg / ml fibronectin and stimulated with a uniform concentration fMLP ( 100 nM ) for 3 min before fixation and staining for actin .

PH - Akt - GFP fluorescence and the corresponding Nomarski images are shown . ( D ) HL - 60 cells were transfected with PAK - PBD - YFP ( top , control ) or with PAK - PBD - YFP and RhoA - Q63L ( bottom , RhoA - Q63L ) and exposed for the indicated times to a uniform concentration ( 100 nM ) of fMLP .

Second , Y - 27632 , a specific pharmacologic redistribution of PAK - PBD - YFP in most RhoA - Q63L - expressing cells but robustly induced redistribution of inhibitor of p160 - ROCK , reversed the inhibitory effects of RhoA - Q63L ( results not shown ) . this probe from cytoplasm to pseudopods in controls ( Figure 2D ; Supplemental Table S1 ) , as we previously reported ( Srinivasan et al . , 2003 ) . As in other cell types ( Ishizaki et al . , 1997 ; Matsui et Effects of Inhibiting Rho and p160 - ROCK on Establishment of Cell Polarity al . , 1996 ) , most effects of Rho - GTP on the actin - myosin cytoskeleton of HL - 60 cells are mediated by a down - We assessed effects of two inhibitors of the Rho path - way : a dominant interfering Rho mutant , Rho - T19N , streamRho - dependentkinase , p160 - ROCK , assuggested by two observations .

Finally , a specific myosin II inhibitor , blebbistatin by inhibitors of Rho and its downstream kinase ( Figure 3 ) .

While these negative observations do not prove that Y - 27632 , theinhibitor of p160 - ROCK , restored attract - ant sensitivity to the trailing edge : the Y - 27632 - treated PTEN translocation plays no role in neutrophil polarity , it is worth mentioning that Jurkat T cells polarize and differentiated HL - 60 cell in Figure 5B , polarized and mi - grating toward a point source of fMLP , rapidly re - migratenormallyinresponsetoappropriatechemokinesactingonGi - coupled receptors ( Gomez - Mouton et al . , sponded to movement of the micropipette by protruding a new pseudopod in its direction rather than by per - 2001 ) , despite the fact that they are devoid of PTEN ( Shan et al . , 2000 ) . forming a U - turn ; similar responses were seen in 10 of 18 Y - 27632 - treated cells ( 58 % ) but rarely in normal cells ; Figure 5C depicts outlines of representative control and Discussion Y - 27632 - treated cells responding to movement of an fMLP - containing micropipette .

Briefly , the attractant binds to a G protein - coupled We tested the possibility that PTX - resistant attractant responses are mediated by G12 and G13 , which stimu - receptor ( R ) , which in turn activates different trimeric G proteins to generate two divergent , opposing signal - late Rho GEFs and thereby trigger Rho - dependent cy - toskeletal responses in vertebrate cells ( Hart et al . , 1998 ; ing pathways , which promote polarized frontness and backness , respectively . In the frontness pathway , Gi , Kozasa et al . , 1998 ; Suzuki et al . , 2003 ) . Dominant - negative G12 (cid:2) and G13 (cid:2) constructs inhibit PI3Ps , and Rac promote de novo formation of actin polymers . One or more positive feedback loops in this GPCR - dependent activation of G12 and G13 signals in CHO cells ( Sugimoto et al . , 2003 ) . Figures 6A , 6B , and first pathway mediate localized increases in sensitivity to attractant : one of these requires polymerized actin , Supplemental Table S2 show that transient expression of these constructs in HL - 60 cells produced phenotypes while Rac or Cdc42 may in addition enhance PI3P accu - mulation more directly , via an alternative pathway ( dot - similaroridenticaltothoseseenwithdominant - negative Rho , Y - 27632 , and blebbistatin ; that is , cells were some - tedcurvedlineinFigure7 ; seebelow ) .

This symmetry - breaking response probably depends on mechanochemical coupling be - that distinct actin assemblies—protrusive polymers at the front and contractile actin - myosin complexes at the tween two different cytoskeletal assemblies . Perhaps application of localized pressure causes actin - myosin back—do not serve simply as read - outs of intracellular signals but , instead , play essential roles in transmitting assemblies to form arrays parallel to the plasma mem - brane , thereby inhibiting protrusion but promoting their and modulating those signals .

Similarly , in Dictyostelium amoebae , the PI3P - dependent frontness pathway diverges from a backness signal , PTEN - trans - location to and from the plasma membrane , at a point in the signaling pathway upstream of PI3Ps : after expo - sure to a uniform concentration of attractant , these cells transiently translocate PTEN - GFP from plasma mem - brane to cytoplasm , and then PTEN returns to the mem - brane ; neither effect is altered by genetic knockouts of two PI3Ks ( R .

( Note that the inhibitory backness program ap - pears to control PTEN translocation in the soil amoeba , but may not do so in HL - 60 cells ; see Supplemental Figure S3 . ) Why is it biologically useful to separate frontness and backness pathways at such an early step ?
