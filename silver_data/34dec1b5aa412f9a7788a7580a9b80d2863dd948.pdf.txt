Recent developments in micros - copy allow sophisticated detection and measuring techniques with which spatio - temporal molecular alterations are conceivable . In this study , we compare two members of aldehyde fixatives [ i . e . , glyoxal ( Gly ) and paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) ] to determine whether Gly , a less toxic dialdehyde fixative that is considered to retain immunoreactivity could provide a successful and consistent cell fixation in favor of PFA in various cell preparations and types . Methods We document the fixation competence of Gly and PFA side - by - side ( with or without Triton X - 100 permeabilization ) in live - and fixed - cell preparations in mouse oocytes , embryos , and human somatic cells ( human umbilical cord - derived mesen - chymal stromal cells ) using protein quantification by Western blot assay and super - resolution microscopy . Results Although Gly seemed to act faster than PFA , catastrophic consequences were found not acceptable , especially in oocytes and embryos . Due to cell lysate and immunocytochemistry surveys , it was obvious that PFA is superior to Gly in retaining cellular proteins in situ with little / no background staining . In many samples , PFA revealed more reliable and consistent results regarding the protein quantity and cellular localization corresponding to previously defined patterns in the literature . Conclusion Although the use of Gly is beneficial as indicated by previous reports , we concluded that it does not meet the requirement for proper fixation , at least for the tested cell types and proteins . However , PFA alone with no addition of TX displayed a significant cytoplasmic loss by generating membrane blebs during fixation . Keywords Aldehyde fixative . Embryo . Fixation . Glyoxal . Oocyte .

Microscopic structures can subsequently be observed in situ after suitable cell / tissue preparations and labeling procedures . For this purpose , a number of chemical fixatives have been used since the nineteenth century [ 1 ] . First introduced in 1893 , formaldehyde ( FA ) , as a member of aldehyde fixatives , in the form of a water - based , diluted solution of 1 : 10 has been the most commonly used chemical fixative , and it is found in many fixative cocktails [ 2 ] . Paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) , the polymerized form of FA , is gener - ally favored over FA because PFA cross - links amino groups without altering the tertiary structure of proteins ; thereby , cellular epitopes remain relatively well - preserved in a successful labeling protocol with specific antibodies [ 3 – 5 ] . PFA fixation has been widely adopted to preserve cell morphology for immunolabeling where the final concentration of PFA in the fixative solution is around 3 – 4 % [ 6 ] . Nonetheless , PFA has also been associated with various problems , ranging from loss of antigenicity to changes in morphology during fixation . Glyoxal ( Gly ) , the smallest dialdehyde reagent with a structural formula that resembles two formaldehyde mole - cules bonded back - to - back , has also been tested as a fixative since the early 1960s [ 7 ] , albeit in fewer studies . Due to a better safety profile , faster reaction rate , and selective control over cross - linking , Gly is considered to retain immunoreactiv - ity and decreases the need for antigen retrieval [ 8 ] . With suit - able catalysts or other reaction accelerators , Gly forms two - carbon adducts with nearly all end groups in proteins and carbohydrates , leaving most of them unimpaired for subse - quent immunohistochemical ( IHC ) demonstration [ 8 ] . Due to the previously reported disadvantages of PFA , Gly has re - cently been suggested superior to PFA as being less toxic and preserves cells better as investigated using super - resolution microscopy [ 9 ] . There are also a number of reports comparing the staining and IHC labeling results between Gly - and FA - fixed tissues . PreFer ™ , a commercial form of Gly , was found to be unsuitable because of poor preservation of tissue mor - phology [ 10 ] ; compared with FA , Gly was found better at preserving the cell membranes and nuclear chromatin in paraffin - embedded tissue sections [ 11 ] ; estrogen receptor staining with antigen retrieval was found significantly weaker in the Gly - fixed specimens than in FA - fixed specimens [ 12 ] . No significant differences were reported between FA and Gly fixation in histomorphometry [ 13 ] , IHC , Western blot ( WB ) [ 14 ] , and fluorescence in situ hybridization [ 15 ] assays . Besides fixation , many samples require a detergent extrac - tion step for exposing antigenic sites to antibodies . As such , using a non - ionic detergent such as Triton X - 100 ( TX ) may be an essential step for improving the penetration of the antibody . TX effectively solubilizes complexes such as biologic mem - branes , and it apparently does not inhibit the antigen - antibody reaction [ 16 ] . However , it is not appropriate for membrane - associated antigens because it destroys lipids among membra - nous proteins . TX may be added to fixation solutions , thus simultaneously performing fixation and extraction actions . Alternatively , in many settings , TX extraction is applied fol - lowing cell fixation in daily use . In this study , we aimed to assess whether Gly could provide a successful and consistent cell fixation in favor of PFA in various cell types and preparations such as isolated mouse granulosa - enclosed or naked oocytes and embryos as well as cultured human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells ( hUC - MSCs ) , all of which were analyzed during and after fixation using a series of antibodies raised against diverse cellular proteins . The study groups were designed to test the PFA ( 3 . 5 % ) and Gly ( 3 % ) alone , as well as with the addition of TX ( 0 . 1 % ) . Additionally , TX ( 0 . 1 % ) application was also performed after the samples were fixed . In short , PFAwas found to be more consistent and potent as a fixative compared with Gly in many circumstances . Here , we present the relatively poor fixation capacity of Gly , proven by a series of quantitative and qualitative data , some of which were obtained using super - resolution microscopy . The overall results seemed quite different from previously published data . Interestingly , however , PFA alone with no addition of TX displayed a significant cytoplasmic loss by generating mem - brane blebs during fixation . Materials and methods Preparation of PFA stock ( 10 % ) and working ( 3 . 5 % ) solutions Stock PFA ( 10 % , w / v ) solution was prepared by adding 100 mg PFA ( 95 % powder ) ( Merck , Germany ) to 650 mL double dis - tilled water ( ddH 2 O ) , then heated to 60 °C using a magnetic 370 J Assist Reprod Genet ( 2020 ) 37 : 369 – 384 heater / stirrer . Fifty microliters of 1 N NaOH was added to dis - solve the PFA completely . After removing from the heater , the suspension was finalized to 1000 mL using ddH 2 O ; the pH was brought to 7 . 2 using 1 N HCl . Stock PFA solution was filtered and cooled down to 4 °C for storage . Immediately before use , to prepare 3 . 5 % PFA working solution , stock PFA solution was mixed with ddH 2 O in 1 : 1 . 85 ratio ( pH = 7 . 2 – 7 . 3 ) . Preparation of Gly working ( 3 % ) solution For preparing a 1000 - mL 3 % Gly working solution , 197 . 25 mL absolute ethanol ( Merck , Germany ) , 79 . 50 mL 40 % Gly ( v / v ) ( Merck , Germany ) , and 7 . 5 mL glacial acetic acid ( Merck , Germany ) were added to 709 . 75 mL ddH 2 O . The solution was vortexed and 1 N NaOH ( approximately 62 . 0 mL 1 N NaOH ) was added until pH = 5 has been reached [ 9 ] . The clear solution was stored at 4 °C and used within few days with no precipitation . Experimental groups The fixation potency of 3 . 5 % PFA and 3 % Gly solutions were tested in mouse oocytes ( mOocytes ) , mouse embryos ( mEmbryos ) , and cultured ( P 4 ) hUC - MSCs , and with or with - out 0 . 1 % TX detergent . The experiment groups and fixation protocol are summarized in Table 1 . Collection and preparation of mouse oocytes / embryos and human cells Oocytes and embryos were obtained from BALB / c ( Bagg ’ s albino , c strain ) female mice ( n = 8 ) at 4 – 6 weeks . The exper - imental protocol was approved by the IRB ( approval number 792 / 20 - 18 . 10 . 27 ) . All mice were hosted with free access to food and water and kept in a 12 - h light / dark cycle . All exper - iments were carried out in accordance with relevant regula - tions and guidelines of Ankara University Animal Care and Use Committee . The germinal vesicle ( GV ) - stage , meiosis - I ( MI ) - stage oocytes , and zygote / blastocyst - stage embryos ( n = 275 ) were obtained from mice primed with 5 IU ( 0 . 1 mL / animal ) pregnant mare ’ s serum gonadotropin ( PMSG ) ( Intervet , UK ) . The details of the collection of mOocytes can be found elsewhere [ 17 ] . For embryo collection , mice were further injected with 5 IU ( 0 . 1 mL / animal ) human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) . Twenty hours after PMSG injection , the mice were killed and then the ova - ries were punctured with a 23 - gauge needle in G - MOPS me - dium ( Vitrolife , Sweden ) . GV - stage oocytes were collected using a mouth - controlled pipette under a dissecting micro - scope ( Nikon , Japan ) . hCG - induced female mice were mated overnight with mature male mice at a rate of 1 female : 1 male . Upon confirming a vaginal plug , zygote - blastocyst stage em - bryos were collected in the following days from the oviducts / uterus as previously described elsewhere [ 18 ] . Fresh umbilical cords ( n = 3 ) were obtained from full - term female infants after cesarean section succeeding the acquisi - tion of informed consent from the mother ( Local Ethics Committee , IRB approval number 18 - 578 - 12 , 2012 ) that the experiments conformed to the principles set out in the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki . The details of obtaining and culture of hUC - MSCs can be found elsewhere [ 19 ] . Briefly , umbilical cord pieces were chopped into approx - imately 0 . 5 - mm 3 tissue explants . Following the lag phase , sprouting hUC - MSC cells were expanded in 75 - cm 2 tissue culture flasks ( Corning ; 430641 , USA ) in DMEM - Ham ’ s F12 media ( Biochrom T481 - 01 , Germany ) at 37 °C 5 % CO 2 until passage 4 ( P 4 ) cells reached 90 – 95 % confluence . At the final stage , confluent cells were removed from flasks using trypsin - EDTA ( 0 . 05 / 0 . 02 % ) ( Biochrom , Germany ) and then transferred onto poly - L - lysine – coated ( 0 . 01 % ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) glass coverslips ( 5000 cells / cm 2 ) and left for at least 48 h before fixation . Prior to fixation , the procedure cells were washed twice with Dulbecco ’ s PBS ( D - PBS ) . Live - cell imaging Live mEmbryos were cumulated in a 50 - μ L drops containing GMOPS covered with Ovoil ™ ( Vitrolife , Sweden ) in glass - bottomed 35 - mm Petri dishes . hUC - MSCs ( 1 × 10 5 cells / cm 2 ) were plated onto glass - bottomed 35 - mm Petri dishes ( World Precision Instruments , USA ) in complete medium ( DMEM / HAM ’ s F12 + 10 % FBS ) ( Merck , Germany ) . All cells were viewed using live - cell imaging microscopy ( con - trolled temp , CO 2 , and humidity ) before and during the Table 1 Fixation / extraction protocol and experiment groups Fixation / extraction agent PFA PFA / TX PFA + TX Gly Gly / TX Gly + TX Formula 3 . 5 % PFA 3 . 5 % PFAwith TX ( 0 . 1 % ) TX ( 0 . 1 % ) after 3 . 5 % PFA 3 % glyoxal 3 % glyoxal with TX ( 0 . 1 % ) TX ( 0 . 1 % ) after 3 % glyoxal Fixation time and temp ( °C ) 15 min @ RT * 15 min @ RT * 15 min + 5 min @ RT * 15 min @ RT * 15 min @ RT * 15 min + 5 min @ RT * * Twenty minutes at room temperature ( RT ) for mOocytes and mEmbryos J Assist Reprod Genet ( 2020 ) 37 : 369 – 384 371 fixation period . Scoping time ( min ) , temperature ( °C ) , and image acquisition interval ( s ) were aligned according to the cell type and fixation groups ( Table 2 ) . All movies were recorded in a time - lapse manner for 15 / 20 min with 5 - or 8 - s intervals using differential interference microscopy ( DIC ) configured on a Zeiss LSM - 880 confocal system ( Zeiss , Germany ) equipped with a Zeiss Axio Observer inverted microscope . A 633 - nm red laser line ( 5 mW ) was used as a light source . At the objective plane ( Zeiss × 20 plan apo / NA 0 . 8 ) , the laser power was measured 1 . 97 mW . The laser power was set to 1 . 2 % during image acquisition to keep the excitation energy as low as possible to avoid any photo damage / toxicity ; therefore , the cells and embryos were scanned with 0 . 023 mW ( 23 μ W ) . Scanning parameters were set in order to achieve pixel dwell time be - tween 0 . 40 and 0 . 50 μ s . Western blotting Total protein , β - actin , vimentin , and α / β - tubulin quantities in unfixed and fixed mOocytes / granulosa cells and hUC - MSCs were determined using WB . mOocytes / granulosa cells were fixed for 20 min ; hUC - MSCs were fixed for 15 min , at RT . Fixed and non - fixed cells were dissolved in lysis buffer [ 1 % sodium dodecyl sulphate ( SDS ) , 1 . 0 mM sodium ortho - vana - date , 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 ] supplemented with 1x protease inhib - itor cocktail ( Amresco , USA ) . The protein concentration was measured using the BCA ( bicinchoninic acid ) method . Fifty mi - crograms of protein from each group was separated on 10 % Tris - HCl gel using protein electrophoresis ( BioRad , USA ) . The gels were stained in Coomassie brilliant blue overnight ( o / n ) . In the following day , they were de - stained in a 50 % methanol , 40 % ddH 2 O , and 10 % acetic acid mixture for 3 – 4 h . The stained gels were scanned and analyzed as described below . To determine the levels of the aforementioned proteins , 50 μ g of cell extract from each group was separated on 10 % Tris - HCl gel and then electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membrane ( Roche , UK ) o / n at + 4 °C . Then , the mem - brane was blocked with 5 % ( w / v ) bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) prepared in TBS - T ( 20 mM Tris / HCl and 150 mM NaCl plus 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 at pH 7 . 4 ) at RT for 1 h . Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies specific to β - actin ( Abcam ; ab8226 ) , vimentin ( Sigma ; V6630 ) , or α / β - tubulin ( Sigma ; T9026 , T4026 ) [ 1 : 1000 in 5 % ( w / v ) BSA containing TBS - T ] for 2 h at RT . Following a triple - wash in TBS - T for 15 min each , membranes were incubated with goat anti - mouse or anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( 800 nm ) ( 1 : 2000 in TBS - T ) ( Licor Biosciences , USA ) at RT for 1 h on a shaker . The SDS - PAGE gels in Figs . 2 and 3 were analyzed by measuring the overall lane intensity that was left after fixation and compared with the non - fixed sample . Protein band intensities were measured using a Li - Cor Odyssey CLx infrared detection system ( LICOR Biosciences , USA ) following the manufacturer ’ s guidelines . Relative band intensities were measured and analyzed using ImageJ v . 3 . 91 software . Live - cell mitochondrial staining Live hUC - MSC monolayers on glass - bottom Petri dishes were incubated with 1 mM MitoTracker ™ ( Molecular Probes ; M7512 , USA ) for 45 min at 37 °C . Cultures were then washed twice with PBS and fixed with six different fixative cocktails for 15 min at RT . In PFA + TX and Gly + TX groups , 0 . 1 % TX was applied for 5 min at RT following fixation and washing . After the final incubation step , monolayers were covered with a glass coverslip and scoped immediately . Nuclear markers Fixed hUC - MSCs were incubated with antibodies against nu - clear proteins such as CENP - A ( 1 : 100 in PBS ; o / n at 4 °C + 2 h at 37 °C ) ( Abcam ; ab45694 , USA ) , lamin A / C ( 1 : 100 in PBS ; following blocking with NGS , 2 h at 37 °C ) ( Abcam ; ab108595 , USA ) , or nucleostemin ( 1 : 250 in PBS ; 2 h at 37 °C ) ( Chemicon International ; MAB4311 , USA ) . Fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG ( Abcam ; ab6717 , USA ) was used as a secondary anti - body .

Cell - specific markers Fixed hUC - MSCs with six different fixative cocktails were immunostained with cell - specific markers such as N - cadherin or CD73 as follows : N - cadherin [ 1 : 100 in PBS ; o / n at 4 °C + 2 h at 37 °C ] ( Sigma ; C3865 , USA ) , CD73 ( 1 : 100 in PBS ; 2 h at 37 °C ) ( Abcam ; ab54217 , USA ) . FITC - conjugated anti - mouse IgG ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ; 115 - 095 - 166 , USA ) was used as a secondary antibody . Cytoskeletal markers Fixed hUC - MSCs were incubated with antibodies against some cytoskeletal proteins such as vimentin ( 1 : 50 in PBS ; o / n at 4 °C + 2 h at 37 °C ) ( Sigma ; V6630 , USA ) , pericentrin ( 1 : 1000 in PBS ; 2 h at 37 °C ) ( Abcam ; ab4448 , USA ) , or α / β - tubulin ( 1 : 1 mixture ) ( 1 : 100 in PBS ; 2 h at 37 °C ) ( Sigma ; T9026 , T4026 , USA ) . FITC - conjugated anti - mouse IgG ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ; 115 - 095 - 166 , USA ) was used as a secondary antibody for anti - vimentin and anti - α / β - tubulin antibodies and FITC - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG ( Abcam ; ab6717 , USA ) for anti - pericentrin . The slides were covered with mounting medium . Fixed mOocytes and hUC - MSCs were incubated with fluorescein phalloidin ( ThermoFisher Scientific ; F432 , USA ) ( 35 mg / mL in PBS for 60 min ) for F - actin staining . All staining steps for mOocytes were per - formed using micro - well trays ( Thermo Scientific , USA ) . Then , they were gently transferred onto glass - bottomed 35 - mm Petri dishes in a 100 - μ L drop of PBS - based mounting medium containing 1 μ g / mL Hoechst 33342 ( Invitrogen ; LSH3570 ) for DNA labeling . The top was covered with par - affin oil . Mouse oocytes have a diameter of around 100 μ m ( including zona pellucida ( ZP ) ) ; therefore , this type of prepa - ration enabled us to visualize the oocyte surface and the inner structures as naturally as possible . Fixed - cell imaging with super - resolution confocal microscopy All fluorescently tagged specimens were examined and imaged using a Zeiss LSM - 880 Airyscan system ( Zeiss , Germany ) . Multiple laser lines ( 405 , 488 , 543 , and 633 nm ) were used according to the fluorescent probes . All laser and scanning pa - rameters were set identical for each protein using a reference histogram ; × 20 ( dry ) , × 40 ( water ) , and × 63 ( oil ) immersion objectives , and gallium - arsenide phosphide or airyscan detectors were used to detect signals . Pixel resolution for 2D and 3D images were set automatically and aligned identically for all image acquisitions . For 3D surface topology assessment of GV - MI stage oocytes , 3D module of Zen Desk software ( v2 . 3 ) was used to analyze the app . 100 - μ m - thick image stacks . Quantification and analysis of fluorescent signals Ten sample images were obtained from each label ( protein ) . The varying signal intensities were analyzed using Zen Blue v2 . 3 histogram tool to calculate the corrected total cell fluo - rescence [ CTCF = Integrated density − ( area of selected cell ) × ( mean fluorescence of background readings ) ] [ 20 ] . The total image area was used to calculate the CTCF value for N - cadherin , CD73 , CENP - A , lamin A / C , nucleostemin , pericentrin , vimentin , and α / β - tubulin . Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS for Windows v15 . 0 software package ( SPSS , Chicago , IL , USA ) . The Kolmogorov - Smirnov test was used to assess the assump - tion of normality . For non - normally distributed continuous vari - ables , differences between groups were tested using the Kruskal - Wallis test . Continuous variables that did not have normal distri - bution are expressed as median ( minimum - maximum ) . A two - sided p value < 0 . 05 was considered as statistically significant . Data are reported as mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . Sum , av - erage , and SD calculations were performed using MS Excel ( Microsoft Corp , Seattle , USA ) . Significance tests were per - formed using SPSS 10 . 0 ( SPSS Inc . , Chicago , IL , USA ) . Data were analyzed using one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and Student ’ s t test when values were normally distributed ; oth - erwise , the Mann - Whitney U test was applied . Differences be - tween the experimental and control groups were regarded as statistically significant when p < 0 . 05 . Results Live - cell imaging of mEmbryos and hUC - MSCs Freshly isolated mouse embryos ( mEmbryos ) and cultured hUC - MSC monolayers in glass - bottomed Petri dishes were microscopically examined using a laser - illuminated differen - tial interference contrast ( DIC ) imaging to observe the cell dynamics during fixation . Prior to fixation , live samples in culture media were recorded in a time - lapse manner for 15 – 25 min ( Fig . 1 , Electronic supplementary movies ) . Subsequently , the same samples were directly taken to fixa - tion simply by replacement of the culture media with the fix - ative solution . As seen in Fig . 1 , Electronic supplementary movies , and Table 3 , a series of significant changes were noted during the fixation interval ( 20 min for mEmbryos or 15 min for hUC - MSCs ) followed by a 5 - min TX incubation . J Assist Reprod Genet ( 2020 ) 37 : 369 – 384 373 Effectiveness of PFA vs . Gly in whole cell lysates The protein cross - linking capacities of the two different fixa - tive ( PFA and Gly ) were tested by evaluating the intensity of unfixed total protein bands per lane ( Figs . 2a and 3a ) . To compare the efficiency of fixation , the bands that survived fixation were summed and expressed as the percentage ( % ) of an unfixed control [ 9 ] . The fixation efficiency of PFA and Gly was assessed in mOocyte / granulosa cell lysates through the evaluation of total WB Coomassie blue - stained and β - actin - labeled bands ( Fig . 2a ) . Seventeen percent of total protein remained unfixed in PFA , whereas 30 % of proteins were found unfixed with Gly . We then tested the degree of fixation of PFA and Gly for three major cytoskeletal proteins ( i . e . , β - actin , vimentin , and α / β - tubulin ) , all of which have low molecular weights ( 42 , 57 , and 50 kDa , respectively ) , after they were labeled with fluorescent markers . Zero percent of β - actin was unfixed with PFA , whereas 50 % was found unfixed with Gly in mOocyte / granulosa cell lysates ( Fig . 2b ) . Fixation of hUC - MSC lysates revealed that PFA was not able to fix only 20 % of proteins , while Gly was not able to fix 55 % of proteins ( Fig . 3a ) . In hUC - MSC cell lysates , 17 % of β - actin Fig . 1 Still images before and during PFA - and Gly - containing fixative cocktails .

The fixed protein ratios are summarized in Table 4 . Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of protein labeling Live - cell mitochondrial staining Mitotracker ™ labeling of living hUC - MSCs revealed fine identification of numerous mitochondria as punctate or rod - like patterns distributed throughout the entire cell cytoplasm ( Fig . 4 ) . Following live - cell Mitotracker ™ labeling , cells were tak - en into fixative cocktails after a brief wash . PFA fixation alone provided smaller numbers and lesser mitochondrial staining showing a dull appearance within the cytoplasm ( Fig . 4 ) . In the PFA / TX group , almost no staining was observed . In con - trast , significantly brighter and clearer signals were detected in the PFA + TX group . Gly fixation alone revealed higher in - tensity and clear signals coming from mitochondria but higher background staining as well . Like in the PFA / TX groups , Gly / TX fixation provided no mitochondrial staining . In the Gly + TX group , no mitochondrial staining was observed but there was a relatively stronger background .

Results are summarized in Fig . 5 . PFA alone or with TX groups revealed fine nucleoplasmic dots , which seemed to correspond to centromeric nucleosome protein in interphase cells labeled by CENP - A antibody ( Fig . 5 ) . PFA alone exhibited slightly higher non - specific background staining , whereas the PFA / TX and PFA + TX groups showed more specific , similar patterns and signal intensity levels . The Gly alone group also displayed punctate staining confined to the nucleus ; however , a stronger cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic background was also noted . In Gly / TX , and more commonly in the Gly + TX groups , nuclear / nucleolar non - specific staining of irregular foci were noted ( Fig . 5 , arrowheads ) . In the Gly + TX group , a significantly smaller number of CENP - A loci were labeled with an intense cytoplasmic background where false - positive results in signal intensity measurements were also noted .

A significantly weaker staining was noted in the PFA / TX group . Gly alone or Gly / TX groups revealed very weak signals compared with the PFA groups , whereas the Gly + TX group displayed stronger and more specific nucleostemin signals compared with the other two Gly groups . Lamin A / C , a complex inner nuclear membrane intermedi - ate filament protein , exhibited a fairly homogenous pattern that was restricted to nuclei after hUC - MSCs were fixed with six fixatives ( Fig . 5 ) . TX addition either to PFA or Gly showed stronger signals that were finely confined to nuclear mem - brane , whereas Gly alone group exhibited an extremely dev - astated lamin A / C pattern . Cell - specific markers In this section , we first demonstrated the qualitative and quan - titative protein fixation by two different fixatives in different cocktails on various cell - specific markers tested in hUC - MSCs . N - Cadherin , a cell adhesion molecule found primarily on the cell surface of mesenchymal cells , was selected to test the fixation capability of the fixatives , and CD73 , a plasma membrane glycoprotein specific to various cell types includ - ing mesenchymal stem cells . All PFA formulations regardless of TX addition , the Gly alone and Gly + TX groups , exhibited fine , granular staining on the cell membrane without any pref - erential localization ( Fig . 6 ) . N - Cadherin signals were detect - ed as fine string - like patterns along the plasma membranes ( Fig . 6 ) and were clearly visualized in the PFA alone , PFA + TX , and Gly + TX groups . The remaining fixatives were un - able to retain the N - cadherin proteins . Interestingly , CD73 signals only in Gly / TX group were consistently detected both on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm , which may be due to the translocation of the CD73 epitopes due to the TX incubation ( Fig . 6 ) . Secondly , we tested the fixation potential of six fixatives on some cytoskeletal proteins ( vimentin , pericentrin , and α / β - tubulin ) . Vimentin , an abundant intermediate filament protein , exclusively expressed in mesenchyme - originated cells , was best retained when cells were fixed with either PFA or Gly with the addition of TX ( Fig . 7 ) . When TX was applied after fixation ( PFA + TX and Gly + TX groups ) , the signal intensity became weak . The lowest signal was detected in the PFA alone and Gly alone groups . None of the fixatives caused any background noise or non - specific staining . The staining of pericentrin , which is a conserved protein of the pericentriolar material , an integral component of the cen - trosome , was exclusively confined to two adjacent juxtanuclear foci ( Fig . 7 ) and best preserved in the PFA + TX and Gly + TX groups ; the lowest signal intensity was measured in the Gly alone group . As the final cytoskeletal element , microtubules composed of α - and β - tubulin were fixed with six fixatives . The results dramatically favored PFA - containing fixatives ( Fig . 7 ) . No significant difference was noted among the PFA - containing fixative groups . Gly - containing fixatives revealed very faint microtubule arrays ( Gly alone and Gly / TX groups ) , and no filamentous array was noted in Gly + TX group . Surface topology mOocytes During fixation procedures with different fixatives , we noted some dramatic differences between PFA and Gly fixatives regarding the morphology of naked mOocytes and cumulus enclosed oocytes . After fixing them with either PFA or Gly and then labeling with FITC - conjugated phalloidin toxins , consecutive optical sections obtained using confocal micro - scope allowed us to visualize those cells as three - dimensional ( 3D ) image stacks . DIC images simply presented the size difference between two fixatives ( Fig . 8 ) ; Gly - fixed cells were significantly smaller than PFA - fixed ones . As clear - ly presented in Fig . 1 and the Electronic Supplementary movie ( Gly - mEmbryos . wmv ) , ZP was heavily affected by Gly fixa - tion , whereas it was intact in the PFA group . Surface rendering of image stacks showed a dramatic difference because the Fig . 4 MitoTracker ™ labeling of hUC - MSCs before and after fixed with six fixative cocktails . Live MitoTracker ™ labeling of hUC - MSCs ( n = 30 experiment ) before fixation . The efficiency of fixa - tives on MitoTracker retaining revealed that the best signal - to - noise ratio was noticed in PFA + TX group . No labeling was retained in the PFA / TX and Gly / TX groups . The Gly + TX group did not display any label , but a strong background . Scale bars : 20 μ m J Assist Reprod Genet ( 2020 ) 37 : 369 – 384 377 378 J Assist Reprod Genet ( 2020 ) 37 : 369 – 384 plasma membranes of mOocytes ( oolemma ) were found dam - aged ( Fig . 8 ) . hUC - MSCs F - Actin filaments , known as stress fibers in cultured cells , are commonly labeled with F - actin - specific mushroom toxins such as phallotoxins . Thus , we wanted to examine whether any signaling intensity and localization difference existed due to the different fixatives in extremely flat hUC - MSC monolayers . Fine fixation is essential for the preser - vation of those tiny cellular processes because cells possess wide lamellipodia and microspikes . PFA exhibited finer fixation as evidenced by the preservation of F - actin - labeled microspikes ( Fig . 8 ) compared with Gly , with which no microspikes were preserved . Discussion The use of Gly as a fixative in the literature is rather old and rare compared with the other aldehyde fixatives . First present - ed in 1943 by Wicks and Suntzeff , Gly was proposed to be more efficient than 10 % formalin ( 3 . 7 % FA solution ) and was reported to be less harmful by inhalation than FA [ 7 , 22 ] . Thus , replacing Gly with FA in the chemical fixation of cells and tissues may be reasonable . However , studies comparing Fig . 6 N - Cadherin and CD73 in hUC - MSCs after they were fixed with six fixative solutions . N - Cadherin was well preserved along theplasma membrane inthe PFA alone ( highest compared with others ; p = 0 . 042 ) , PFA + TX , and Gly + TX groups ( n = 8 for labeling ; n = 80 for signal quantification ) ( first column ) . CD73 was well preserved in all fixative groups ; however , in the Gly / TX group , the signal intensi - ty was detected significantly higher than in the other groups ( p = 0 . 021 ) ( second column ) . CD73 signals in the Gly / TX group were further analyzed in 3D reconstructed image stacks obtained using super - resolution microscopy in the Z - axis ( 2 . 44 μ m in thickness ) . X - Y - axis lateral and X - Z , Y - Z - axis orthogo - nal sections showed that most of the CD73 epitopes translocated to the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm ( n = 6 for labeling ; n = 60 for sig - nal quantification ) . Scale bars : 20 μ m  Fig . 5 Nuclear proteins in hUC - MSCs after fixed with six fixative solutions . CENP - A were characterized by nucleoplasmic spots when fixed with PFA alone , PFA / TX , or PFA + TX ( first column ) . The signal intensity levels between the three groups were non - significant ( p = 0 . 999 ) asquantifiedusingCTCFmeasurements giveninthe graphs . Gly alone or Gly with TX groups generally displayed intense cytoplasmic and / or nu - cleoplasmic background staining as well as irregular nuclear / nucleolar foci ( arrowheads ) ( n = 5 for labeling ; n = 50 for signal quantification ) . Nucleostemin in hUC - MSCs was specific but with varying intensities with no background ( second column ) . The highest intensity was detected in the PFA alone group ; the Gly alone Gly / TX groups showed the lowest intensities ( p = 0 . 019 ) ( n = 6 for labeling ; n = 60 for signal quantifica - tion ) . Lamin A / C appeared predominantly on the nuclear membrane ex - cept in the Gly alone group , which displayed a disrupted arrangement ( third column ) . Scale bars : 10 μ m J Assist Reprod Genet ( 2020 ) 37 : 369 – 384 379 the fixation efficiency of FA with Gly in the preservation of different cellular targets ( membrane receptors , cytoplasmic , and nuclear targets ) as well as the general morphology in tissue sections presented that FA was superior to Gly because Gly frequently resulted in significantly weaker and / or non - specific staining [ 10 , 12 , 23 ] . From the time when the fixation efficacy of PFA was rec - ognized as better for electron microscopy in the 1970s [ 24 ] and then for immunocytochemistry ( ICC ) in the 1980s , it has become the most commonly used aldehyde fixative , especial - ly in precise microscopic observations in cell and molecular biology . In this study , we wanted to compare those two aldehyde fixatives side - by - side using WB assays and super - resolution confocal microscopy to determine whether Gly , as a historic and lesser - known compound , has any superior capac - ity for fixation over cellular proteins . Very recently , Richter et al . published a comprehensive and well - designed data series pertaining to Gly vs . PFA fixation and concluded that 51 cel - lular targets were better preserved after Gly fixation [ 9 ] . This led us to test Gly for our samples , most of which are related to male and female reproductive organs , early embryonic and adult stem cells . Results emerged from human spermatozoa specimens are in writing process . Our overall comparison of PFA and Gly results are summarized in Table 5 , where Fig . 7 Preservation of vimentin , pericentrin , and α / β - tubulin in hUC - MSCs after fixing with six fixative solutions . Vimentin was well retained with all fixatives ( first column ) ; however , the best and most consistent signals were found in the PFA / TX and Gly / TX groups ( p = 0 . 001 ) ; the PFA + TX and Gly groups displayed weak vimentin signals ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( n = 5 for labeling ; n = 50 for signal quantification ) . Pericentrin was best retained in the PFA + TX and Gly + TX groups ( p = 0 . 005 ) ; the Gly alone group revealed the lowest signal intensity ( p = 0 . 002 ) ( second column ) . Pericentrin proteins were also well - preserved in occasionally encountered mitotic cells ( arrows ) ( n = 5 for labeling ; n = 50 for signal quantification ) . α / β - Tubulin staining was best - preserved in all PFA formulations ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( third column ) , whereas Gly groups in general exhibited vary faint staining . Gly + TX did not preserve any α / β - tubulin ( n = 6 for labeling ; n = 60 for signal quantification ) . Scale bars : 20 μ m 380 J Assist Reprod Genet ( 2020 ) 37 : 369 – 384 positive and negative outcomes are designated as green and red colors , respectively . In the study by Richter et al . , the final pH of Gly was determined as 5 after they obtained similar results at pH 4 and 5 for most of their experiments . Therefore , we adopted Gly at pH 5 for all sets of our experiments . They calculated the proportion of the proteins that remained unfixed in brain lysates and found that 40 % and 20 % of proteins were unfixed with PFA and Gly , respectively . In contrast , as summarized in Table 4 , we found that significantly more proteins remained unfixed after Gly fixation . Interestingly , Gly very consistently resulted in higher band intensities than those in PFA ones in hUC - MSCs and mOocyte lysates where fixed proteins either no longer ran into the gel or formed smears only . More spe - cifically , the fixation efficiency of PFA favored Gly because β - actin , vimentin , and α / β - tubulin proteins were retained with greater proportions after PFA . In addition to the degree of β - actin preservation , we also demonstrated the lack of F - actin - decorated microspikes in Gly - fixed somatic cells and surface disruptions in F - actin - labeled oocyte cortex as ren - dered using high - resolution consecutive fluorescent images . In contrast to our findings , different laboratories that contrib - uted to Richter et al . ’ s study reported that a relatively higher ratio of β - actin , α - and β - tubulin , and F - actin was preserved with Gly . Nevertheless , they reported that a higher vimentin ratio was retained with PFA based on their ICC staining . Live - cell imaging of embryos during fixation revealed that Gly caused thinning and then rupture of ZP , and disso - ciation of blastomeres , whereas tiny infrequent membrane blebs were noted in somatic cells . PFA , on the other hand , maintained the blastocyst morphology as intact as possible while generating the formation of large cytoplasmic blebs in somatic cells . Gly with TX showed similar findings in embryos while maintaining the cytoplasmic and membrane structures in somatic cells . TX application after fixation revealed no further change either in embryos or somatic cells . Based on our live - hUC - MSC videos during fixation , we agree with the statement proposed by Richter et al . [ 9 ] that a higher speed of membrane penetration and the sudden interruption of vesicle trafficking was seen with Gly . In contrast to PFA , which resulted in the formation of large membrane blebs and continued almost during the entire fixation period , Gly displayed a very fast and relatively intact vesicle preservation with very few tiny blebs during fixation . However , Gly caused a significant decrease in the size of embryos and oocytes , as demonstrated in Figs . 1 and 8 . Although some of the above features may seem advan - tageous to Gly , the catastrophic changes in the embryo caused by Gly were not acceptable . We assume that Gly - originated perturbations may be due to its acidic nature , which arises from its fast oxidation , and therefore lead to the formation of strong acids , mainly glyoxylic acid [ 25 ] . In situ labeling of diverse proteins using ICC after PFA or Gly fixation did not exhibit results superior to Gly . Briefly , Gly caused a higher number of unstained epitopes , a stronger background , and non - specific staining . Gly was occasionally found better than PFA in terms of fluorescence signal intensity . Fig . 8 Preservation of cellular processes and plasma membranes in mOocytes and hUC - MSCs . DIC images of mOocytes and cumulus - enclosed ( asterisks ) oocytes showed the size difference , dissolution ( arrowheads ) , and disappearance of ZP in the Gly group compared with the intact ones in PFA group ( arrows ) ( n = 16 from each independent experiment ) . DIC images showed the extremely flat , huge cell bodies of hUC - MSCs . Surface topologic renderings confirmed the size difference , ZP dissolution , and oolemma destruction in mOocytes . F - Actin - labeled microspikes ( arrows ) were detected by surface topological renderings in hUC - MSCs . As indicated by thin arrows , microspikes were well pre - served by PFA , whereas Gly was not able to retain those cellular process - es ( n = 3 for labeling ) . Scale bars : 20 μ m J Assist Reprod Genet ( 2020 ) 37 : 369 – 384 381 All cross - linking reagents ( all aldehyde group fixatives ) form intermolecular bridges , normally through free amino groups , thus creating a network of linked antigens . Cross - linkers preserve cell structure better than organic solvents , but may reduce the antigenicity of some cell components , and require the addition of a permeabilization step to allow access of the antibody to the specimen [ 26 ] . Non - ionic de - tergents such as TX are widely used to permeabilize and solubilize membrane proteins in a gentler manner , allowing the solubilized proteins to retain a native subunit structure and enzymatic activity [ 27 ] . Non - ionic detergents are con - sidered non - denaturating because they break lipid - lipid and Table 5 The overall performance of tested fixatives on various cell markers based on the intensity measurements and qualitative analyses using ICC in hUC - MSCs . Green designates positive outcomes and red refers to negative outcomes NS not stained , NB no background staining , ND not determined as there is no literature information a Staining intensity out of three grades b Nonspecific background staining out of three grades c Concordance with known cellular pattern as defined by poor ( ★ ) , moderate ( ★★ ) , and well ( ★★★ ) 382 J Assist Reprod Genet ( 2020 ) 37 : 369 – 384 lipid - protein , but not protein - protein interactions [ 28 ] ; as such , they are considered for use in the isolation of mem - brane proteins in cell and molecular biologic applications [ 27 ] . Due to our TX - containing fixative results , some pro - tein labels were partially / completely lost ( i . e . , Mitotracker , CD73 , and N - cadherin ) , whereas the intensity of some la - bels was enhanced ( i . e . , CENP - A , lamin A / C , nucleostemin , and vimentin ) . Conclusively , the superiority of PFA over Gly was clear , at least for certain cell types and proteins as we have pre - sented here . However , no single type of fixative cocktail and protocol seems to fit to all types of samples and pro - teins . Thus , it is still noteworthy to suggest that the proper fixative ( with or without TX addition ) formulae and fixa - tion procedures should be carefully determined through a series of well - designed comparative experiments to opti - mize protein preservation as naturally as possible .
