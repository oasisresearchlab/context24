RES EAR CH A RT I C LE Open Access Highlights of glycosylation and adhesion related genes involved in myogenesis Vincent Grassot , Anne Da Silva , James Saliba , Abderrahman Maftah , Fabrice Dupuy and Jean - Michel Petit * Abstract Background : Myogenesis is initiated by myoblast differentiation and fusion to form myotubes and muscle fibres . A population of myoblasts , known as satellite cells , is responsible for post - natal growth of muscle and for its regeneration . This differentiation requires many changes in cell behaviour and its surrounding environment . These modifications are tightly regulated over time and can be characterized through the study of changes in gene expression associated with this process . During the initial myogenesis steps , using the myoblast cell line C2C12 as a model , Janot et al . ( 2009 ) showed significant variations in expression for genes involved in pathways of glycolipid synthesis . In this study we used murine satellite cells ( MSC ) and their ability to differentiate into myotubes or early fat storage cells to select glycosylation related genes whose variation of expression is myogenesis specific . Results : The comparison of variant genes in both MSC differentiation pathways identified 67 genes associated with myogenesis . Comparison with data obtained for C2C12 revealed that only 14 genes had similar expression profiles in both cell types and that 17 genes were specifically regulated in MSC . Results were validated statistically by without a priori clustering . Classification according to protein function encoded by these 31 genes showed that the main regulated cellular processes during this differentiation were ( i ) remodeling of the extracellular matrix , particularly , sulfated structures , ( ii ) down - regulation of O - mannosyl glycan biosynthesis , and ( iii ) an increase in adhesion protein expression . A functional study was performed on Itga11 and Chst5 encoding two highly up - regulated proteins . The inactivation of Chst5 by specific shRNA delayed the fusion of MSC . By contrast , the inactivation of Itga11 by specific shRNA dramatically decreased the fusion ability of MSC . This result was confirmed by neutralization of Itga11 product by specific antibodies . Conclusions : Our screening method detected 31 genes specific for myogenic differentiation out of the 383 genes studied . According to their function , interaction networks of the products of these selected genes converged to cell fusion . Functional studies on Itga11 and Chst5 demonstrated the robustness of this screening .

They are located between the basal lamina and striated muscle cells in muscle tissue , and their princi - pal roles are post - natal growth , maintenance and the regeneration of skeletal muscle [ 1 - 3 ] . Satellite cells may undergo asymmetric division for their renewal and produce daughter cells that enter into myogenic differentiation [ 4 ] . Satellite cells are multipotent and can differentiate into early fat storage cells or osteoblasts under different environmental conditions [ 5 , 6 ] . Gene expression com - parison allows for the characterization of the genes specific to each pathway . Myogenesis is composed of three steps , ( i ) alignment of cells , ( ii ) fusion of cells in myotubes , and ( iii ) matur - ation of myotubes . These three steps are regulated by various transcription factors such as the myogenic regulation factors ( Mrfs ) [ 4 , 7 - 11 ] . The study of gene expression variation during cell differentiation is fluently used to determine the genes with the most interest [ 12 ] . It is also well established that interactions between the * Correspondence : jean - michel . petit @ unilim . fr INRA , UMR 1061 Unité de Génétique Moléculaire Animale , Université de Limoges , Faculté des Sciences et Techniques , 123 Avenue A .

Such regulations and interactions are different from those involved in early - adipogenesis . Therefore , both path - ways require tightly regulated recognition systems . One of the better systems to enhance specificity of recogni - tion is glycans and adhesion proteins . Glycosylation is a process that leads to the formation of a great diversity of glycan structures . These struc - tures are specifically involved in response to the cell environment during developmental stages , and cell fate [ 14 ] . We selected genes whose products are involved in glycan synthesis ( e . g . nucleotide sugar transporters and glycosyltransferases ) as well as genes encoding protein , which recognize glycan structure such as lectins ( e . g . selectin ) , adhesion molecule family ( e . g . melanoma cell adhesion molecule ) and other adhesion proteins ( e . g . integrin family ) . These genes are called Glycosylation Related Genes ( GRG ) . Janot et al . demonstrated the change in expression for some of these genes during early myogenic differentiation of the murine cell line C2C12 [ 15 ] . Using this cell model , they suggested that myoblast fusion may require glycosphingolipid rear - rangements and / or terminal modifications on glycolipids and glycoproteins ( such as fucosylation and sialylation ) . Among glycoproteins , the adhesion proteins must play a crucial role in cell migration and adhesion ; one of the most important families is composed of the integrins [ 16 - 18 ] . Integrins are plasma membrane heterodimers that me - diate both cell - cell and cell - extracellular matrix interac - tions [ 19 ] . Integrin subfamilies are classified on the basis of the association of a common β subunit with distinct α subunits to form unique heterodimers . The integrins ITGA4 and ITGB1 have already been described for their myogenic role . They form the VLA - 4 complex , an essen - tial adhesion complex interacting with VCAM1 to influ - ence cell alignment and / or cell fusion [ 20 ] . In this study , we compared the expression of 383 genes during the differentiation of murine satellite cells ( MSC ) into myotubes or early fat storage cells . Comparison of gene expressions in both differen - tiation pathways and previous data on C2C12 [ 15 ] revealed that only 31 genes were mainly involved in myogenesis . Fourteen of them have the same variation pro - file during C2C12 and MSC myogenesis . The remaining seventeen showed a variation only during MSC myo - genesis while they were significantly expressed without changes during C2C12 differentiation ; e . g . the gene encoding the integrin alpha 11 subunit ( Itga11 ) . The use of shRNA or neutralizing antibodies against this integ - rin subunit decreased cell fusion by at least 50 % . Thus Itga11 is critically involved in myotube formation using MSC as a model . Results MSC differentiation and selection of GRG specific to myogenesis To identify genes which displayed an expression vari - ation in myogenesis with MSC as progenitor cells , we profiled and compared gene expression during myo - genesis or early - adipogenesis . MSC seeded on Matrigel® were differentiated by reduction of serum for 72 hours or trans - differentiated in the presence of ambient 50 mM glucose for 168 hours . The time points were chosen to obtain a percentage of myotubes in myogenic differen - tiation similar to the percentage of early fat storage cells obtained in trans - differentiation . The differentiation state was confirmed by ( i ) staining of nuclei in myotubes to quantify the percentage of fusion or to follow fat storage accumulation to determine the trans - differentiation state ( Additional file 1 ) ; and ( ii ) measurement of MyoG , MyoD1 , Myf5 and Myf6 myogenic markers and Dlk1 and Ppara markers of the early adipogenic step ( Figure 1 ) . In myo - genic differentiation conditions , MyoG expression dra - matically increased ( 70 fold ) during the first 24 hours before reaching a plateau ( Figure 1 ) whereas in trans - differentiated MSC it did not exceed 4 fold . A contrast - ing variation of Myf5 expression was observed , with expression increasing during myogenesis only . Surpris - ingly , Myf6 and MyoD1 transcription were similar in both pathways . This similarity between trans - differentiation and myogenesis could be explained by the presence of ambient glucose which tends to increase myogenic differentiation in cells already engaged in this process [ 21 ] . As expected for the adipogenic markers Dlk1 and Ppara , expression increased notably during trans - differentiation whereas no significant variations were observed during myogenesis ( Figure 1B ) . These results showed the precise control of MSC myogenic differentiation into myotubes or trans - differentiation into early fat storage cells , respectively . Thus , we can follow and compare the expression of glycogenes and genes encoding adhesion proteins dur - ing MSC differentiation in both pathways . Only GRG with a change in mRNA expression of at least two folds was retained for each differentiation pathway . Using this comparative approach we identified 112 genes with a significant variation . Among them , only 67 genes had a variation specific for MSC myogenesis ( Additional file 2 ) . The remaining 45 , which also varied during early adi - pogenesis , were discarded . Then , we compared our results with the myoblastic cell line C2C12 [ 15 ] . GRG is specifically involved in myogenesis Since C2C12 cultures were seeded on plates without Matrigel® in the previous study [ 15 ] , we controlled that culture on Matrigel® did not improve the differenti - ation potential of these cells . The comparison between Grassot et al . BMC Genomics 2014 , 15 : 621 Page 2 of 17 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2164 / 15 / 621 cultures of C2C12 on plates coated with Matrigel® or with - out it revealed no significant difference in differentiation induction , as recently reported [ 22 ] . We also demon - strated that no difference appeared in the fusion index and Myogenin expression ( Figure 2 ) . The expression of Itgb8 as a reference , during myogenic differentiation of C2C12 seeded on plates coated with Matrigel® or not , showed no difference between the two culture conditions ( Figure 2 ) . The comparison of 67 specifically up or down regu - lated genes during MSC myogenesis to the results obtained by Janot e t al . [ 15 ] led to the identification of two subgroups . The first included 17 genes without expression variation throughout C2C12 differentiation whereas their expression varied during MSC differen - tiation ( group B , Table 1 ) . In the second subgroup , 50 genes were identified whose expression varied in both cell types ( Figure 3 ) . Among the latter , only 14 had similar variation profiles during C2C12 and MSC myogenesis ( group A , Table 1 ) . Therefore , 31 genes seemed to be essential for myogenic differentiation ( Figure 3 ) and were retained for further studies . Figure 1 Expression of myogenic and early step adipogenic markers . A .

An unsuper - vised hierarchical clustering algorithm was used to study 67 genes . This approach , described in Materials and Methods , relies on the time course comparison of differential expression of each gene when C2C12 and MSC strains are analyzed . The resulting tree was split into eight groups ( some details of the subdivisions over the last group ( group 8 ) are given ( 6 sub - clusters can be identified in this group ) ) ( Figure 4A ) . 26 genes ( from group A or B ) fall into the 5 main groups ( 3 , 5 , 7 , 8 ( 4 ) , 8 ( 6 ) ) ( including at least seven genes ) . 12 of the fourteen genes of group A are split into clusters 3 , 5 , 7 and 8 ( 6 ) ( Figure 4A ) . In cluster 3 , gene expression increased early in differentiation ( a clear up - regulation ) for C2C12 and only at 48 hours for MSC ( Figure 4C ) . Cluster 5 contains 6 genes from group A with similar expression profiles in both conditions : these genes were clearly down - regulated ( Figure 4D ) .

This cluster also includes 4 genes from group B ( Figure 4B ) . Group 8 ( 4 ) also contains 7 genes from group B which had a significant variation in expression only in MSC ( Figure 4E ) . The remaining group B genes are split between clusters 5 ( 2 genes ) , 7 ( 1 gene , Figure 4F ) and 3 minor groups ( 1 , 6 and 8 ( 1 ) ) . We observed that 26 of the 31 genes selected were gathered “ without a priori ” . It demonstrates the confidence we can have in our selection method . Myogenesis requires the presence of adhesion proteins and the sulfation of keratans As shown in Table 1 , we observed the highest changes in expression for Chst5 , Itga11 genes which were the most up - regulated ( 54 and 316 fold , respectively ) and Itgb7 which was down - regulated ( 0 . 16 fold ) . To understand what cell processes could be affected by these expression variations , we classified the 31 genes according to their function [ 23 - 51 ] ( Table 2 ) . We showed that a large part of these genes encoded adhesion proteins ( around 30 % ) , and only one of them was down - regulated . For the remaining 19 genes , 4 genes are involved in sulfation with Chst5 which specifically sulfates the keratans . The 7 down - regulated genes were unrelated to myogenesis ( e . g . : the Clgn product is involved in spermatogenesis [ 48 ] ) . We observed a difference with the study of Janot et al . [ 15 ] for genes involved in lacto / neolacto series biosynthesis . Indeed , we found none of the seven genes previously described . They were discarded because they varied in both myogenic and early adipogenic pathways . Figure 3 Determination of myogenesis specific genes . Comparison between 93 genes significantly regulated in early adipogenic differentiation ( pink arrows ) and 112 in myogenic differentiation ( purple arrows ) of Mouse Satellite Cells ( MSC ) revealed 67 genes specifically regulated during myogenesis .

These results corre - lated well to previously observed mRNA levels ( Table 1 ) . Gene repression using shRNA against Itga11 and Itga4 ( as a control due to its well - known implication in fusion [ 52 ] ) was performed on MSC 24 hours before induction of myogenic differentiation and repression was verified by RT - PCR ( Figure 5A ) . The amount of ITGA11 was dramatically reduced in treated MSC although it slightly increased during differentiation ( Figure 5B ) .

It showed an up - regulation of Itga11 before differentiation ( Figure 5A ) that did not affect the fusion ability of the cells ( Figure 6 ) . shRNA transfected cells ( against Itga11 or Itga4 ) showed a large decrease mRNA level in MSC ( Figure 5A ) . This resulted in a low number of myotubes in treated culture after 72 hours of myogenic differentiation ( Figure 6 ) . The fusion index obtained for untreated MSC cells or cells treated with the negative control shRNA did not display a significant difference ( Figure 7 ) . A significant inhibition of MSC fusion occurred and the fusion index only reached 2 . 5 % for shRNA treatment after 72 hour differentiation ( Figure 7 ) . Itga11 antibodies inhibited the cell fusion Regarding the effect of Itga11 down - regulation , we pro - ceeded to study the neutralization of ITGA11 during differentiation . Treatments were performed on MSC cultures with antibodies against ITGA11 or ITGA4 ( as control ) . After 3 days , the fusion index was significantly reduced for both treatments ( Figure 8 ) . At 72 hours , the fusion indexes of treated cells were reduced by approxi - mately 65 % in both cases . In MSC cultures containing both antibodies , the fusion index was decreased by 90 % after 72 hour differentiation ( Figure 8 ) . This result indi - cated a direct involvement of ITGA11 in the MSC fusion and 2 different effects of both integrins in this process .

So we treated MSC cultures with shRNA against Chst5 and controlled the induced repression by RT - PCR ( Figure 9A ) . We also controlled the correlation with the protein amount by western blot in MSC ( Figure 9B ) . The treated cultures showed a de - crease of Chst5 expression and a lower protein amount . After 24 hours in the differentiation condition , the fu - sion index observed in culture treated with shRNA against Chst5 was significantly lower than that observed for the untreated culture ( Figures 10 and 11 ) . This difference remains until 72 hours of differentiation but appeared to decrease . This indicates that Chst5 inhibition only induced a delay in MSC fusion . This result and those obtained for Itga11 strengthen our gene selection . Discussion Cell migration , adhesion and fusion require many changes in the cell surface and environment during myogenesis . Janot et al . ( 2009 ) used a RT - PCR - based screening method to detect 37 glycosylation related genes ( GRG ) with a large variation in expression during the early myogenic dif - ferentiation of C2C12 [ 15 ] . However , the genes specif - ically involved in myogenesis were not distinguished from those that were expressed independently from a differentiation pathway and those which were associ - ated with C2C12 immortality . In this study we refined the screening using murine satellite cells ( MSC ) since ( i ) they better reflected the in vivo state and ( ii ) they can be differentiated into myotubes or into early fat storage cells . By comparing 383 GRG ( Additional file 4 ) expression in MSC differentiated in one or the other differentiation pathway we retained 67 genes specific - ally associated with the myogenesis out of 383 studied . Compared to GRG previously found by Janot et al . , these 67 genes can be divided into two groups . The first one contains 17 genes whose expression varies in only MSC . The second is composed of 50 genes with vari - ation in both C2C12 and MSC , 14 only showing the same pattern of expression . We did not retain the 36 other genes because differences in their expression pro - files seemed to depend on cell type rather than on myo - genesis . The discrepancy between these results and the ones previously published by Janot and co - workers is mainly due to a more drastic screening that discards genes common to pre - adipogenic and myogenic differ - entiation . So , we retained 31 genes that seem specifically involved in myogenic differentiation . We strengthened our selection by using “ without a priori ” clustering of GRG selected in the MSC model . We found 26 of the previously selected 31 genes were distributed into 5 clusters among the 13 clusters ob - tained . Cluster 5 included all 8 down - regulated genes . 6 of them had a similar variation during C2C12 and MSC myogenesis ( Table 1 , group A ) . Since the other 23 genes were all up - regulated in C2C12 and / or MSC , they were mainly found in 4 clusters : clusters 3 and 7 which Figure 5 Itga11 knockdown decreased mRNA and protein amount . A . Relative quantities of Itga4 ( soft grey ) and Itga11 ( white ) mRNA for treated cultures , or untreated cultures ( black ) in MSC . For treated cultures with negative control shRNA ( dark grey ) , both Itga11 and Itga4 mRNA were quantified but to simplify , only the relative quantity of Itga11 is shown . B . Detection of ITGA11 by western blot during myogenesis . Proteins were extracted from MSC culture , before ( 0 h ) and during differentiation ( 24 h , 48 h and 72 h ) and the quantities of ITGA11 were revealed by western blot using Actin as control .

This demonstrates that our separation and the distribution by “ without a priori ” clustering of the GRG were very close . To explore the relationship between GRG up - and down - regulation , and myogenesis , we classified them according to the function of their products ( Table 2 ) .

Most of them are responsible for extracellular matrix synthesis ( B4Galt1 , Chst5 , Chst12 , Cmah , Galntl1 , Gcnt2 , Has1 and Has2 ) ; they are up - regulated while those coding for sulfation of glycans car - ried by glycolipids or glycoproteins are down - regulated ( Chst8 and Chst10 ) . The alignment of cells and myotubes requires a different structural organization of the extra - cellular matrix molecules such as lumican , composed of keratan sulfates [ 53 ] . In this study , an up - regulation of B4Galt1 and Chst5 involved in keratan sulfate bio - synthesis was observed . The latter also depends on the synthesis of O - glycan core 2 structure . 2 up - regulated genes encoding proteins of the O - glycan biosynthesis pathway , Galntl1 and Gcnt2 , are also implicated . In addition , considering all up - or down - regulated GRG during myogenic differentiation , without taking into account their variation in early adipogenesis , we found that GRG expression variations were more favourable for core 2 biosynthesis ( Additional file 5 ) . Indeed , Gcnt1 was up - regulated in both differentiation pathways . How - ever , in myogenic cells , biosynthesis continued to keratan sulfate since B4Galt1 and Chst5 gene expression in - creased . So , we propose that the regulation of some GRG contributes to core 2 O - glycan biosynthesis and Figure 10 Chst5 knockdown induced a late in myotube formation .

Finally , it has been shown recently that Gcnt1 up - regulation is associated with myocardial hypertrophy in mice [ 54 ] , which supports our theory . Significant adhesion protein involvement during cell fu - sion is likely since 12 of the 31 genes encode proteins of this family . Among them , we observed an up - regulation of a protein containing a lectin domain , CLEC2D , a murine osteoclast inhibitory lectin [ 25 ] necessary to promote MSC myogenesis . The LGALS7 lectin plays a key role in stabilization of glycoconjugates in epithelial repair [ 31 ] . It could play a similar stabilizing role in myogenesis . The up - regulation found for CD248 or Endosialin , known as a potential actor of angiogenesis in which it contributes to cell - cell alignment and con - tacts [ 24 ] , seems to be explained . Again , up - regulation of KLRA2 ( or Ly - 49 ) , a cell surface receptor of class 1 myosin heavy chain , could be related to the high expres - sion of its ligand in skeletal muscle [ 30 ] . We also found into adhesion proteins 5 integrin sub - units ( ITGA5 , ITGA6 , ITGA11 , ITGB7 and ITGB8 ) and 2 adhesion molecules ( ICAM2 and MCAM ) . ICAM2 , whose expression increases during C2C12 and MSC myogenesis , is notably expressed in adult satellite cells [ 55 ] . It can link α - actin / actin to form a membrane - actin interaction that reinforces cell - cell interactions as de - scribed in neuroblastomas [ 26 ] . MCAM is known to have a role in cellular adhesion and in cohesion of the endothelial monolayer [ 32 ] ; it could have the same role in myogenesis . Moreover , Cerletti et al . reported that Mcam gene is highly expressed in human foetal myo - genic cells [ 56 ] . Therefore , there is a good relationship between this result and the up - regulation found in MSC . The integrin family is of particular interest and is often involved in cell contact , signaling , adhesion and fusion [ 19 ] . From our results , a network model ( Figure 12 ) , with a central role for the integrins , is proposed to par - tially explain myogenesis regulation . The Itga5 gene en - coding an integrin subunit ( ITGA5 ) was up - regulated . ITGA5 forms a heterodimeric complex with ITGB1 and then with Nischarin during control of cell migration [ 57 ] . Interestingly we observed that Hpse was also up - regulated . The protein encoded by this gene ( Heparanase ) is known for its role in cell migration through the digestion of ECM , creating a balance with ITGA5 activity [ 41 ] . We noticed the up - regulation of Itgb8 . The ITGB8 protein , associated with ITGAV and a metalloprotease , activates transforming growth factor β - 1 ( TGF - β 1 ) in epithelial cells or neurons [ 27 , 28 ] . Although TGF - β 1 is known to inhibit myogenic differentiation [ 58 ] , Gouttenoire et al . demonstrated that it can also activate Itga11 transcrip - tion in mouse chondrocytes [ 59 ] . In addition , genes encoding hyaluronan synthases HAS1 and HAS2 are up - regulated and hyaluronans are described to promote sequestration of the TGF - β 1 receptor in lipid rafts which limits their interaction with TGF - β 1 [ 60 ] . Finally , up - regulation of Chst12 involved in dermatan sulfate biosynthesis may indicate an increase in the production of decorin , known to bind and regulate the sensitivity of chicken satellite cells to TGF - β 1 [ 61 ] . All results suggest that cells could regulate TGF - β 1 effects through different pathways and may limit its action to Itga11 activation ( described later ) . Our model also used cell signalling according to the up - regulated integrin subunit ITGA6 . It forms a complex with ITGB1which has recently been described as essential for neuronal differentiation of human embryonic stem cells . The binding of the com - plex to laminin molecules induced differentiation [ 29 ] so we integrated a similar system in our model of myo - genesis . Recently , ITGA6 was linked to the expression of cell migration - related genes [ 62 ] , it could be also play a role in cell migration as ITGA5 . Laminin can also bind α - Dystroglycan and organize muscle structure . The 120 kDa form of α - Dystroglycan , in chicken myoblast cultures , is present at the late stage of myogenesis [ 63 ] . This form is likely to be less rich in mannose type O - glycan . In our model , we associated the decrease in Pmm1 and Chst10 expression with this phenomenon . Because PMM1 is involved in UDP - mannose synthesis and the sulfotransferase , CHST10 , is responsible for terminal sulfation of O - mannosyl gly - cans , they are presumably involved in cell adhesion [ 64 ] and could be related to the structures present on the α - Dystroglycan molecule [ 65 ] . Earlier , we showed that Itga11 showed the highest variation in expression . This gene encoding the ITGA11 subunit has also been shown to be up - regulated during myofibroblast differentiation in cardiomyopathy [ 66 ] . We included this integrin in our model because it has already been described to be produced by human cor - neal myoblasts and to be involved in development of the latter [ 67 ] . To verify the involvement of selected GRG in myogenesis , Itga11 and Chst5 were chosen for a functional study . Treatment of MSC with shRNA di - rected against the Itga11 transcript before and during myogenic differentiation strongly inhibited cell fusion . ITGA11 depletion stopped the fusion after 24 hours only ( Figure 8 ) . The MRFs expressions were followed during the differentiation of treated cells and we ob - served a complete inhibition of the Myf6 expression ( Additional file 6A ) . The expression of Myf6 is usually related to the fusion process . The addition of anti - ITGA11 antibodies strongly inhibited fusion ; after 72 hours , under differentiation conditions , less than 7 % fusion was ob - served . The same result was obtained with anti - ITGA4 antibodies and ITGA4 is known for its involvement in fusion during myogenesis [ 52 ] . The combined action of Grassot et al . BMC Genomics 2014 , 15 : 621 Page 12 of 17 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2164 / 15 / 621 antibodies against both integrins completely inhibited cell fusion . This result demonstrated that the effect of each antibody could be cumulative ( or synergistic ) . Since no compensations were observed in shRNA ex - periments , we suggest that the two integrins contrib - ute independently to the binding of cells to different MEC components . Now it is clear that ITGA11 plays a role during myogenesis , especially in the fusion process . The cells treated with shRNA against Chst5 showed a delay in fusion during the first 48 hours of differentiation . However , they recovered a fusion index quietly similar to untreated cells at 72 hours under differentiation con - ditions . This effect could be explained by the involve - ment of CHST5 in the sulfation of keratans . The low amount of CHST5 during 48 hours of differentiation was not sufficient to permit enough sulfation of kera - tans and thus the cell fusion . Beyond of the 48 hours , the keratan sulfate amount was sufficient to allow a quick fusion of cells . Indeed , at 72 hours of differenti - ation the fusion index was close between treated and untreated cultures . This result correlated to the MRFs expression observed during the differentiation of treated cells ( Additional file 6B ) . Indeed , MyoG up - regulation during the first 24 hours showed that cells are engaged in myogenesis . The Myf6 expression increased only from 48 hours and harshly rose until 72 hours as observed for the fusion index . These results demonstrate the import - ance of Chst5 to initiate the fusion step of myogenesis . The relationship between Itga11 , Chst5 and myogenesis step strengthens our selection as well as our myogenic regulation model . Conclusion In this study , the comparison between the adipogenic and myogenic differentiation of MSCs , as well as be - tween two cell types ( C2C12 and MSC ) that differenti - ate into myotubes allowed us to select 31 genes whose expression is particularly associated with myogenesis . We classified these genes into 3 groups , according to the function of the proteins they encode : ( i ) remodel - ling of the extracellular matrix where genes are pre - dominantly up - regulated such as Chst5 ; ( ii ) glycan biosynthesis with more particularly an up - regulation of genes involved in core 2 glycan synthesis ; ( iii ) adhesion where genes are mainly up - regulated such as Itga11 . We have also shown that Itga11 knockdown and neutralization of ITGA11 protein strongly inhibit cell fusion whereas the knockdown of Chst5 delayed the fusion of myoblast . These results emphasize our selection of genes and their involvement in myogenesis . We suggest a potential Figure 12 Interaction network leading to cell fusion during myogenesis . The network was constructed according to the literature and based on twelve variant genes . Genes are in bold ( + : up - regulated or − : down - regulated ) . The thickness of the lines is proportional to the expression levels of genes during myogenesis . Blue arrows show the pathways checked by functional experiments . Myogenic steps are in purple rectangles and boxed in red when cells are engaged in this step and in white for later steps . Grassot et al .

Finally , this study pro - vides a suitable complementary method for the study of specific differentiation pathways . Methods Cell cultures The murine C2C12 myoblast cell line ( ATCC , Manassas , VA , USA ) was cultured in DMEM ( Dulbecco ’ s modified Eagle ’ s medium , Eurobio , Courtaboeuf , France ) supple - mented with L - Glutamin , 10 % ( v / v ) fetal calf serum ( Eurobio ) , 50 units / mL penicillin and 50 μ g / ml strepto - mycin . Cells were grown to 80 % confluence and differ - entiated into myotubes in DMEM supplemented with 5 % ( v / v ) horse serum ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . The medium was changed every 48 hours . Murine satellite cells were extracted from posterior leg muscles of C3H mice as previously described [ 68 ] . Cells were cultured in “ medium A ” containing HAM F10 medium ( Sigma ) supplemented with 5 mM L - glu - tamin , 20 % ( v / v ) horse serum , 50 units / mL penicillin , 50 μ g / mL streptomycin and 5 ng / mL Basic - Fibroblast Growth Factor ( Sigma ) . At 70 % confluence cells were differentiated into myotubes with HAM F10 medium supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) horse serum or trans - differentiated into fat storage cells when 50 mM glu - cose were added to “ medium A ” . Determination of cell fusion index and staining of early fat storage cells After removing culture medium , cells were washed twice with PBS , fixed with 10 % ( v / v ) formalin for 15 min at room temperature and washed twice again with PBS . Nuclei were stained with Shandon Harris hematoxylin ( 0 . 44 % ( v / v ) , Thermoscientific , Courtaboeuf , France ) for 1 hour at room temperature and then washed twice with PBS . Cytoplasm was stained with Shandon eosin Y aque - ous ( 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) , Thermoscientific ) for 30 min at room temperature . Fusion index of C2C12 and satellite cells was determined by the ratio between nuclei in myotubes and total nuclei on six different microscopic fields . To identify early fat storage cells , fixed cells ( 10 % ( v / v ) formalin , 30 min , 37°C ) were stained with 0 . 3 % Oil - Red - O ( Sigma ) in 60 % isopropanol according to the protocol described by Salehzada et al . [ 69 ] . Quantitative real - time PCR ( QRT - PCR ) For each kinetic point , cells were rinsed twice with PBS and harvested following trypsinization ( PBS , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 05 % ( w / v ) trypsin ) . Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini Kit ( Qiagen Inc . , Hilden , Germany ) . A micro - fluidic chip was used to measure quality and quantity of total RNA ( Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser , Agilent Technologies Inc . , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) and 1 μ g was converted into cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit ( Applied Biosystems , Foster city , CA , USA ) . mRNA was quantified by QRT - PCR on ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detector System using TaqMan probe - based chemistry ( Applied Biosystems ) , with 6 - carboxyfluorescein ( FAM ) as a reporter . cDNA ( 2 ng ) was used to quantify myogenic and adipogenic markers and target genes in 96 - well plates and Taqman Low Density Array ( TLDA ) respectively . In addition to genes already present on TLDA as previously described by Janot et al . [ 15 ] , we also followed the expression of 8 genes encoding integ - rin subunits ( Itga1 , Itga8 , Itga10 , ItgaD , ItgaE , ItgaV , Itgb1 , and Itgb6 ) to complete this gene family . Relative quantification was performed using five reference genes : 18S RNA , G6pdx , Gapdh , Tcea , Tbp . Data analysis and clustering mRNA gene transcription data were collected and ana - lyzed using SDS 2 . 2 . 2 software ( Applied Biosystems ) . The first accessible data was the Ct , the minimum number of cycles necessary to obtain a significant fluorescent signal ; therefore genes with a Ct above 35 were considered as not expressed . Relative quantification was obtained using the ΔΔ Ct method [ 15 ] . mRNA quantity was normalized using Cts from Gapdh , Tbp and 18S RNA and t = 0 h was used as a reference sample . The evolution of the expression level along the kinetic points was also considered to discard point showed aberrant relative quantity ( e . g . RQ = 0 . 001 or RQ = 10000 ) . The relative quantity for these points was indicated as “ not determined ” ( n . d . ) . The following process for distance computation as well as hierarchical clustering was performed with a script , per - sonally communicated by G . Lelandais and previously used by Lucau - Danila et al . [ 70 ] . All genes for which a change of more than two folds was observed at least once during the experiments were selected using Log2 ( ratio ) data sets of time courses . A cluster analysis was conducted on similarity measurements between the differential gene expression profiles . More precisely , each gene can be given a coordinate of two expression vectors defined as C2C12 g ( Tm ) and SatC g ( Tm ) , where C2C12 g ( Tm ) and SatC g ( Tm ) are the logarithms to base 2 of the ratios for gene g in C2C12 or satellite cells respectively , measured at Tm , the time point of the kinetic [ Tm which is included in T ( 12 h , 24 h , 48 h , 72 h ) ] . Thus , considering two genes , g 1 and g 2 , the similarity ( D ) between them is computed as follows : D g 1 g 2 ð Þ ¼ X T m ∈ T ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ C 2 C 12 g 1 T m ð Þ ‐ C 2 C 12 g 2 T m ð Þ (cid:3) (cid:4) 2 þ SatC g 1 T m ð Þ − SatC g 2 T m ð Þ (cid:3) (cid:4) 2 q A complete - linkage hierarchical clustering analysis was performed next , by using the distance matrix . Initially , each object is assigned to its own cluster and then , at each stage , the two most similar clusters are joined by the algorithms that proceed iteratively . The process Grassot et al . BMC Genomics 2014 , 15 : 621 Page 14 of 17 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2164 / 15 / 621 continues until the analysis reaches a single cluster . The resulting tree is finally split into several groups of genes . Library function in R was used [ http : / / cran . r - project . org ] , and graphical representations were obtained with MeV ( MultiExperiment Viewer v 4 . 7 . 4 ) [ 71 ] . Immuno - neutralization experiments One day before induction of differentiation , satellite cells were treated with 1 μ g / mL isotypic antibodies ( purified sheep IgG , R & D systems ) , rat anti - ITGA4 or sheep anti - ITGA11 ( R & D systems , Minneapolis , MN , USA ) . Treat - ments with anti - ITGA4 or isotypic antibodies were used as positive or negative controls respectively . Immuno - neutralization was maintained by addition of antibodies every 24 hours at the same concentration . For these kin - etic points , the fusion percentage was determined using culture without antibody as assay . Knockdown by ShRNA MSC were seeded at 5×10 3 cells / cm 2 on Matrigel® - coated plates , cultured in growth medium for 2 days and cultured in differentiation medium for 3 days . The medium was changed every 24 hours and cells were treated during the days 2 and 3 . Treatments were 200 μ L medium containing 4 μ g plasmid and 2 μ L transfecting reagent ( Attracten , Qiagen ) . Cells were untreated , treated with a plasmid containing shRNA without target , treated with plasmid containing shRNA targeting Itga4 or treated with plasmid containing shRNA targeting Itga11 or Chst5 . Cultures were stopped and stained every 24 hours during differentiation and the fusion percentage was calculated . Total RNA was also collected and knock - down of Itga4 , Itga11 and Chst5 expression was verified by PCR with Gapdh as control . Probes used were : Itga4 - Forward : AGACCT GCGAACAGCTCCAG ; Itga4 - Reverse : GGCCTTGTC CTTAGCAACAC ; Itga11 - Forward : GGCCGCCTTCC TCTGCTTCA ; Itga11 - Reverse : TTGCCACCCCTGGT GGCGAT ; Chst5 - Forward : CTGAGCGGCTCTTTGT GTGC and Chst5 - Reverse : TCAAGGAGGTGCGCTT CTTT . The relative quantity was determined as follows : ( i ) the area and mean grey values were taken into ac - count , ( ii ) obtained values were normalized to Gapdh ( iii ) normalized values for the control culture were assigned a value of 1 for each time point ( iv ) final ratios were equal to normalized values obtained for treated cultures at a certain time points divided by values for untreated cultures at the same times . Western blot analysis At each time point of differentiation , cell proteins were ex - tracted with Triton buffer ( Tris 50 mM Tris , 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 , 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) sodium deoxycholate , pH7 . 4 , protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , Boulogne - Billancourt , France ) ) . Proteins ( 50 or 100 μ g protein loaded per lane ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE using 10 % - polyacrylamide gels . Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for 90 minutes at 0 . 8 mA / cm 2 . Membranes were saturated with TBS ( 20 mM Tris , 137 mM NaCl , pH7 . 6 ) supple - mented with 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) Tween 20 and 2 . 5 % ( w / v ) pow - dered skim milk , for 1 h 30 at room temperature . Blots were probed with anti - ITGA11 ( 1 μ g / mL at 4°C over - night , R & D systems ) or anti - CHST5 antibodies ( 1 μ g / mL at 4°C over - night , Bios ) followed by peroxidase coupled goat anti - rat IgG for ITGA11 ( 1 : 1000 for 1 h 30 min at room temperature , R & D systems ) or by peroxidase coupled swine anti - rabbit IgG for CHST5 ( 1 : 1000 for 1 h 30 min at room temperature , Dako ) . Bands were visual - ized by enhanced chemoluminescence ( CN 11500694001 , Roche ) . Membranes were washed 3 times with TBS - 0 . 05 % ( v / v ) Tween after incubations .
