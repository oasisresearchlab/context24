A Systematic Review of Asymptomatic Infections with COVID - 19 Abstract Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) in late December 2019 , it has brought significant harm and challenges to over 200 countries and regions around the world . However , there is increasing evidence that many patients with COVID - 19 are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms , but they are able to transmit the virus to others . There are difficulties in screening for asymptomatic infections , which makes it more difficult for national prevention and control of this epidemic . This article reviews the characteristics , treatment , and outcomes of asymptomatic infections with COVID - 19 , hoping it would be helpful for early prevention and control of this severe public health threat worldwide . Keywords : SARS - CoV - 2 , COVID - 19 , asymptomatic infections , epidemiological characteristic , outcome Introduction At the end of December 2019 , a novel coronavirus pneumonia began to spread in Wuhan , China . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) officially named this disease coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) on February 11 , 2020 . At the same time , the International Virus Classification Commission ( ICTV ) announced that the new coronavirus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) . Since the outbreak , COVID - 19 has brought major harm and challenges to more than 200 countries and regions around the world . To date , more than 3 , 000 , 000 cases have been confirmed worldwide and the cumulative deaths have exceeded 200 , 000 . 1 , 2 COVID - 19 initially has been divided into four types : mild , moderate , severe , and critical cases . 3 However , with the global outbreak of coronavirus , there is increasing evidence that many infections of COVID - 19 are asymptomatic , but they can transmit the virus to others . Asymptomatic infections refer to the positive detection of nucleic acids of SARS - CoV - 2 in patient samples by reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) , but have no typical clinical symptoms or signs , and no apparent abnormalities in images , including lung CT . 4 The clinical characteristics of asymptomatic infections and other types of COVID - 19 is shown in Table 1 . Early recognition of an infected person and cutting off the route of transmission are key points to control COVID - 19 . However , most asymptomatic infections do not seek medical assistance due to no obvious clinical signs and poor prevention awareness , which contribute to the rapid spread of COVID - 19 . Therefore , it is a great challenge to prevent and control this specific type of patient globally , which requires more attention worldwide . Infectivity Asymptomatic infections have the same infectivity as symptomatic infections . 5 It has been reported that a 53 - year - old UK patient with an asymptomatic COVID - 19 infection may cause 11 infections . 6 A report pointed out that one asymptomatic person who had been infected with viral nucleic acid for 19 days from contact with the source of infection may have spread to 5 people . 7 These asymptomatic cases may play a role in the transmission and therefore pose a significant challenge to infection control . Estimates of the incidence of asymptomatic infections will clarify the epidemiological potential of COVID - 19 transmission and understanding of the true universality of the disease . There are many studies on the incidence of asymptomatic infections ( Table 2 ) , but each study has its limitations . First of all , due to insufficient awareness of asymptomatic infections and limited detection capabilities in the early stage of the outbreak , China’s 1 . 6 % may be underestimated . 8 On the contrary , another study investigated 565 Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan at the end of January and found that the incidence of asymptomatic infections was 30 . 8 % . 9 Another example is the “Diamond Princess” cruise ship , which was isolated in Japanese waters in early February due to COVID - 19 infection found that the incidence of asymptomatic infections was 51 . 7 % . 10 Some researchers suggested that the above two studies overestimated the incidence , but in fact , a person truly has a higher risk if he has close contact with diagnosed or suspected infected persons in a relatively confined space . Incidence of asymptomatic infections from other studies had some shortcomings , such as those in Korea 11 and Washington 12 , which showed inaccurate results due to the small sample size . One case in Wuhan tracked the prevalence of 1391 children under 15 years old who had been in close contact with infected or suspected cases . 13 The incidence of asymptomatic infections in the children is lower than that of the whole population , we propose that it is related with the special immune response and ACE2 level in the children bodies . 14 According to these studies , the ability of asymptomatic infections to spread the virus is not low , and these patients are likely to cause a new round of outbreaks . Therefore , finding asymptomatic infections is the key point for early prevention and control of COVID - 19 worldwide . The incubation period is the approximate time from the first exposure to the virus until the clinical symptoms or signs onset , and patients can also transmit the virus in this period . 15 Asymptomatic infections have no special incubation due to no clinical signs . However , a recent research found that the viral load detected in asymptomatic populations was similar to that in symptomatic patients , indicating that asymptomatic infections have the potential for transmission , which may occur early in the course of infection . 16 Since the viral nucleic acid positivity refers to that the virus load in samples reaches a certain limit , but the infectivity mainly depends on whether the virus is in a reproductive state . 17 That is , sometimes , despite ongoing high viral loads , no live virus can be isolated , which means that viral nucleic acid positivity does not indicate infectivity . 18 It is also proved by a clinical study in which the recovered COVID - 19 patients who had no obvious clinical symptoms were detected to be positive for SARS - CoV - 2 by hyper - sensitive viral nucleic acid re - examination methods , but these patients had not caused new infections . 19 Due to the limited data from current studies , we think that it is necessary for us to be highly vigilant to asymptomatic infections . Moreover , viral nucleic acid positivity has been reported not to be always considered , and more clinical studies are still needed to verify that . A previous study found that the median period of asymptomatic patients from viral nucleic acid positive to negative was 9 . 5 days , the longest was up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases . 20 Then in another study found that the median period from contact to diagnosis and the last positive nucleic acid test was 19 days ( 8 – 24 days ) and 21 . 5 days ( 10 – 36 days ) , respectively . 21 The median period from diagnosis to negative nucleic acid test was 7 . 5 days ( 2 - 20 days ) with normal or atypical chest computed tomography ( CT ) infections and 12 . 5 days ( 8 - 22 days ) with typical CT findings . 21 However , an asymptomatic infection should be quarantined for 14 days until now , 22 more studies are still needed to assess the infectivity duration of asymptomatic cases . And if necessary , more attention should be paid for some special infectious individuals who need longer segregation due to the result of nucleic acid test . Distribution The most likely source of asymptomatic infections is close contacts of patients who have been diagnosed or suspected , and family clusters have been presented before . Also , colleagues , friends , and persons who coincide with the trajectories of diagnosed or suspected patients are all regarded as high - risk populations . Familial clustering has made the epidemic challenging to prevent and control . Some family members do not have any clinical manifestations , but the nucleic acid test result is positive , and this has become a major difficulty in the prevention and treatment of COVID - 19 . In one case report , all three of the family members were diagnosed with COVID - 19 , and only one family member had clinical symptoms . 23 Another family cluster report showed that the first patient was in good health without clinical manifestations , including fever and cough , and denied having primary diseases . He went to the local hospital for treatment only because of urticaria . The patient complained that he had lived in the local area for a long time and had not been to the epidemic area . However , the investigation of the disease control expert found that the patient had close contact with his relatives in Hubei Province one week before the onset of symptoms . Finally , by investigating the family members and close contacts of the patient , three pulmonary CT scans were normal , but the nucleic acid test results were positive . 24 Family members of COVID - 19 patients , even without any symptoms , should be closely monitored and examined to rule out infection . These cases also highlight the need for a close epidemiological investigation to prevent the omission of possible sources of contamination . Different individuals may have different clinical signs . Studies have shown that asymptomatic infections are more common in populations of young and middle - aged individuals with functional performance status without underlying diseases . It was reported that asymptomatic cases were more common in middle - aged people in Shenzhen ( median age : 49 years , 30 . 9 % between 30 - 49 years ) 25 and a few younger people in Nanjing ( median age : 32 . 5 years ) . 20 Above all , age and body condition may play an important role in the severity of COVID - 19 , and this is related to different immune responses and other potential pathogenesis . Pathogenesis Similar to SARS - CoV , SARS - CoV - 2 invades cells by using angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) as its receptor . 26 Because ACE2 - mediated angiotensin II ( Ang ll ) degradation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of severe lung failure after a viral infection , the severity of the virus infection is closely related to the maturity and binding capacity of ACE2 . 27 Therefore , we supposed that a lower level of ACE2 and weaker binding capacity with SARS - CoV - 2 should be a major factor that leads to the absence of any clinical manifestations for asymptomatic infections . It has been reported that only a specific mild immune response is caused by the SARS - CoV - 2 invasion in asymptomatic patients . 28 However , more clinical samples should be collected , and a relative examination of ACE2 should be performed and compared for different types of COVID - 19 cases , as this would be helpful to explain its pathogenesis . Prevention and control The main mode of transmission of COVID - 19 is through droplet and contact transmission and high - concentration aerosols . Droplet transmission occurs when nearby people ingest or inhale respiratory droplets ( produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes ) . The successful isolation of live virus from throat swabs is a significant difference from SARS , suggesting that viral replication in upper respiratory tissues is active and that SARS - CoV - 2 is more effective than SARS - CoV in spreading through active shedding of pharyngeal viruses . 18 A German team found that some people with COVID - 19 had high levels of virus in their throat swabs when their initial symptoms were mild , meaning that the pathogen was quickly released and transmitted to others by coughing or sneezing ( droplet transmission ) . 29 This means that protective measures , including wearing protective masks , can prevent infection with new coronavirus to a certain extent . Most people with an asymptomatic infection do not seek medical assistance due to no obvious clinical signs and poor prevention awareness . More epidemiological methods , including close contact screening , cluster epidemic surveys , and follow - up surveys of the source of infection , were used to identify people with asymptomatic infections . The significance of asymptomatic infections as a source of infection depends on the distribution in the population and the amount and duration of virus elimination . However , clinical symptoms are hidden , and we can only rely on immunology or nucleic acid detection technology to obtain information about the infection ; therefore , this kind of infectious source cannot be effectively identified , making it very difficult to prevent and control . Nucleic acid testing should be performed in persons who have contacted diagnosed or suspected COVID - 19 patients . A person with an asymptomatic infection should be quarantined for 14 days . 22 After the quarantine period expires , in principle , those who have negative test results for two consecutive samples of nucleic acid ( sampling interval of at least 24 hours ) can be released from quarantine . If symptoms occurred during quarantine , the person should be admitted immediately . However , due to the limitations of specimen collection and detection methods , the influence of the high false negative rate of the RT - PCR should be paid attention to , which may lead to missed diagnosis or delay in effective diagnosis . 30 For this purpose , combination of repeated nucleic acid detection and chest CT imaging examination should be effectively carried out for those highly suspected SARS - CoV - 2infections . 31 Treatment and outcome The latest guidelines from the Chinese health authorities indicate , 3 for the treatment of COVID - 19 , suspected and confirmed cases should be treated in isolated hospitals with effective isolation and protection conditions . Divided into ( 1 ) general treatment : close monitoring of vital signs and symptomatic support treatment . ( 2 ) antiviral therapy : patients with a positive nucleic acid test result can be given α - interferon , lopinavir / ritonavir , ribavirin , chloroquine phosphate , etc . ( 3 ) mechanical ventilation treatment and rehabilitation plasma treatment for severe patients . ( 4 ) traditional Chinese medicine treatment . There is currently controversy regarding the treatment of asymptomatic infections . Some researchers supported that antiviral therapy could fasten viral clearance on asymptomatic infections . 20 , 24 While , it has been reported that isolation and close observation is enough for asymptomatic infections . In one report , lopinavir / ritonavir and abidol were not reported to be effective in improving symptoms or accelerating viral clearance . 32 It was also reported that despite the treatment of aerosolized interferon ( IFN ) α 2 β , and two tablets of lopinavir / ritonavir ( 200mg / 50mg ) were used twice a day for 10 days , viral nucleic acid were still positive , which showed that these antiviral drugs did not seem to be effective . In addition , side effects were observed after antiviral therapy , such as liver impairment . 33 Therefore , antiviral treatments not suggested for asymptomatic infections now , maybe more clinical studies are needed to further confirm its effectiveness . Until now , isolation and close observation is regarded as a better option for these asymptomatic infections . A few people with an asymptomatic infection may develop into symptomatic cases during isolation , but the vast majority will heal on their own . A study of 24 asymptomatic patients showed that all asymptomatic patients did not develop severe disease or death , of which 18 ( 75 . 0 % ) were virus cleared after antiviral treatment , 9 were discharged from the hospital , and 9 were kept in the hospital for observation . In particular , one case was positive again even after the nucleic acid test negative for twice . 20 They can only be discharged after having at least two consecutive negative nucleic acid test results ( tested 24 hours apart ) . 2 Some patients turn positive again after being discharged , so further isolation treatment and continuous nucleic acid testing can also be recommended for discharged patients . It is recommended to continue the isolation management , and health examinations should be continued for 14 days after being discharged , and regular follow - up visits should be conducted in the 2nd and 4th weeks after being discharged . 3 Conclusions This manuscript reviewed the epidemiological characteristics and prevention measures of people with an asymptomatic infection of COVID - 19 . However , the research evidence is very limited , and the specific characteristics of asymptomatic infections need to be further clarified . In summary , rigorous epidemiological investigations and laboratory testing are helpful in identifying people with asymptomatic infection . To better prevent and control the risk of COVID - 19 disease , it is recommended to screen for high - risk populations such as close contacts , especially in one confined space with diagnosed or suspected infected patients , which will be helpful for early control this global epidemic effectively .
