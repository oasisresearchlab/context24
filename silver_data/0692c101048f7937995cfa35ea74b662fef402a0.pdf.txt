The actin and cofilactin filament bending stiff - ness and corresponding persistence lengths obtained fromall - atom simulations are comparable to values obtained from analysis of thermal fluctuations in filament shape . Filament flexibility is strongly affected by the nucleotide - linked conformation of the actin subdomain 2 DNase - I binding loop and the filament radial mass density distribution . ADF / cofilin binding between subdo - mains 1 and 3 of a filament subunit triggers reorganization of sub - domain 2 of the neighboring subunit such that the DNase - I binding loop ( DB - loop ) moves radially away from the filament . Reposition - ing of the neighboring subunit DB - loop significantly weakens subunit interactions along the long - pitch helix and lowers the fila - ment bending rigidity . Lateral filament contacts between the hydrophobic loop and neighboring short - pitch helix monomers in native filaments are also compromised with cofilin binding . These works provide a molecular interpretation of biochemical solution studies documenting the disruption of filament subunit interactions and also reveal the molecular basis of actin filament allostery and its linkage to ADF / cofilin binding . cytoskeleton ∣ biopolymer ∣ mechanics ∣ molecular dynamics ∣ coarse - grained A ctin is an abundant and evolutionary conserved eukaryotic cell protein that is essential for a broad range of cellular movements . Actin exists in two forms : a globular / monomeric form and a self - assembled linear filament polymer that grows and shrinks from its ends . The dynamic equilibrium between the forms is controlled by a number of factors including solution conditions and regulatory proteins ( 1 ) . Actin filaments are a main structural feature of all muscle tissue ( 2 ) , and controlled polymer - ization of branched networks of actin filaments produce force for cell motility ( 3 ) . A key dynamical feature of networks of actin filaments is a continuous reorganization based on controlled polymerization and depolymerization . The actin regulatory protein , actin depolymerization factor ( ADF ) / cofilin , serves a vital function in cells by severing filaments , thereby increasing the number of filament ends from which polymerization and depolymerization can occur ( 4 ) . ADF / cofilin binds cooperatively to actin filaments in a 1 ∶ 1 stoichio - metric ratio ( 5 – 9 ) . The ADF / cofilin binding site on a filament subunit is believed to be near the hydrophobic binding pocket between subdomain 1 ( SD1 ) and SD3 of actin ( 7 , 10 ) . Actin filaments fully decorated with ADF / cofilin ( termed cofilactin hereafter ) filaments have significantly different struc - tural properties compared with their bare actin counterparts . ADF / cofilin filaments have an altered helical twist ( 7 ) , modified lateral contacts within the actin core ( 11 ) , and an altered subunit tilt ( 12 ) . Given the role of ADF / cofilin in filament severing , it is perhaps not surprising that ADF / cofilin binding enhances destabilizing modes within the actin filament ( 12 ) . Cofilactin filaments also have unique elastic properties . ADF / cofilin binding increases the torsional ( 13 ) and bending flexibi - lities ( 14 ) of actin filaments , the latter is manifested as a reduc - tion in the persistence length . This increased flexibility has been attributed to a disruption of the contacts between two adjacent actin subunits in the helical strands of the filament — when visua - lized by electron microscopy , contacts between SD1 and SD2 of neighboring intrastrand subunits are compromised with cofilin binding ( 12 , 15 ) . This interpretation is supported by biochemical studies ( 16 ) showing that ADF / cofilin alters the average distance between the C terminus and DNase - I binding loop ( DB loop ) of adjacent filament subunits . A number of key unanswered questions remain regarding the structure of cofilactin as well as the underlying molecular origin of the experimentally observed modulation of filament elasticity . Molecular simulation , specifically all - atom molecular dynamics ( MD ) , is well - suited for investigating these questions because it permits sampling all atomic degrees of freedom in a system . MD has been valuable in providing all - atom descriptions of fundamental aspects of actin assembly , dynamics , and function . For example , classical and biased MD simulations have recently been successfully employed to investigate the role of actin poly - merization in the rate of ATP hydrolysis ( 17 ) , the role of nucleo - tide state in determining the conformational state of the DB loop ( 18 ) , and how the DB loop conformation influences the elastic properties of filaments ( 18 – 20 ) . This body of work in conjunction with a number of other MD studies of actin ( 19 , 21 – 23 ) , ADF / cofilin ( 24 ) , and actin - related proteins ( 23 , 25 ) demonstrate the potential of computer simulation to provide atomic informa - tion underlying the behavior of the actin cytoskeleton . Herein we seek to address some important unanswered ques - tions regarding cofilactin filaments , namely the structural basis of altered cofilactin filament bending mechanics and cofilin - linked filament allostery . We report previously undescribed MD simula - tions of various actin and cofilactin filament models — we have performed over 200 ns of simulation of cofilactin and additionally reanalyzed some of our previous studies of filamentous actin . The simulation results are used to compute the persistence length , provide an overall molecular interpretation of the experimental evidence that point to reorganization of SD2 in actin , and identify an overall mechanism for how ADF / cofilin binding alters the structure of actin filaments .

Technical details regarding the MD simulations and preparation of the initial structures are detailed in the meth - ods section . Within the present study we systematically varied the structure of the filament [ Oda et al . ( 26 ) vs . Galkin et al . ( 15 ) ] , the configuration of the DB loop ( α - helical vs . loop ) , and additionally investigate the effect of ADF / cofilin binding on a native ( 26 ) actin filament . All cofilactin models tested have a single cofilin bound between SD1 and SD3 of each filament subunit ( 10 ) . Structural Properties of Cofilactin Filaments . The cofilactin structure used for simulations was derived from electron microscopy studies by Galkin et al . ( 15 ) . Cofilactin filaments have an altered twist and tilt compared to native ( i . e . , bare ) actin filaments ( 7 , 12 ) . The cofilactin filament has a twist of ∼ 163 degrees , corresponding to a helical repeat of ∼ 30 nm , which is markedly shorter than native filaments with a helical repeat of ∼ 36 nm ( 13 subunits / repeat ) and twist of ∼ 166 degrees . The native actin filament structure was based on the recent refinement by Oda et al . ( 26 ) . We additionally simulated an unmodified cofilactin filament ( referred to hereafter as cofilactin - 13 ) inspired by a recently published model ( 10 ) , where - in it was suggested that such a structure may resemble an initial binding mode of cofilactin . To provide a clear set of control simulations , filaments were simulated with the DB loop in the folded and unfolded conformation . These various models comprehensively evaluate the effects of cofilin decoration , subunit tilt , and DB loop disorder on the filament structure and dynamics . Recent studies ( 27 , 28 ) that indicate actin filaments in solution exist in three equilibrium states — a canonical ( e . g . , Holmes or Oda - like ) , tilted ( i . e . , as in our cofilactin simulations herein ) or with SD2 completely disordered . This distribution is modulated by cofilin binding ( 13 , 27 , 29 ) . Kinetic analysis of cofilin binding has also revealed the existence of two distinct cofilactin filament states in a rever - sible equilibrium ( 29 ) . In this work we systematically test the abil - ity of the canonical and tilted equilibrium conformations to account for the filament mechanics . The third conformation with SD2 disordered ( 30 , 31 ) could not be studied via MD simulation because atomic coordinates of the disordered SD2 region are lacking . Nonetheless , as detailed below , MD simulations of these two filament conformations yield a plausible molecular basis for enhanced cofilactin flexibility . We first compared the overall structure and stability of native ( i . e . , bare ) and ADF / cofilin - saturated ( cofilactin ) filaments dur - ing MD simulations from the equilibrium unit cell dimension ( i . e . , the length of one cofilactin or actin helical repeat length in our simulation ) , filament root mean squared deviation ( RMSD ) , and subunit RMSD of the DB loop and C terminus , respectively ( Table 1 ) . The filament RMSD was calculated with respect to the initial structure and included only the 11 or 13 in - dividual actin subunits for clarity of comparison between the bare and cofilactin filaments . We calculated the subunit RMSD for the DB loop by aligning a single actin subunit against the initial sub - unit structure ( not including the atoms of the DB loop ) and then calculating the displacement . Such an approach is an effective way to determine the conformational flexibility of a small region of a large protein . The same approach was used for the C terminus ( defined as the final five residues of each subunit ) . The impact on cofilin binding on actin ’ s hydrophobic loop ( HL ) ( residues 262 – 274 ) was also evaluated . Both the RMSD of the HL ( analyzed in an identical fashion as the DB loop ) and also the number of cross - strand contacts between the HL and actin are reported ( Table 1 ) . The overall stability of the HL is identical for both actin and cofilactin , but the number of cross - stand contacts decreases by nearly a factor of two in the cofilactin filament , consistent with structural studies showing that cofilin weakens lateral filament contacts ( 11 ) . We note for clarity that this procedure was performed on each of the 11 or 13 actin subunits within each filament to obtain maximal sample size . The enhanced conformational flexibilities of the actin DB loop and C terminus are particularly interesting given their role identified in filament structure and dynamics ( 32 ) . All filament equilibrium lengths determined from MD are in good agreement with their experimental counterparts ( Table 1 ) . The overall RMSD of the cofilactin filaments are significantly higher than both the bare actin filaments and the cofilactin - 13 filament . In fact , cofilactin - 13 was , overall , the most stable filament investigated . Additionally , the RMSD of the DB loops showed that in the cofilactin systems , the DB loop has noticeably higher flexibility . In contrast , the RMSD of the C termini of the filaments ranges from 2 . 3 – 3 . 2 Å , a value that is nominally similar to that observed for the entire actin protein itself ( 19 , 22 , 23 ) . Fig . S1 shows a comparison between an initial ADF / cofilin simu - lation and a snapshot from the simulation as well as a comparison with bare actin . The higher flexibility of the DB loop relative to the rest of the actin subunit ( Fig . 1 and SI Text ) may be the source of disorder observed by electron microscopy ( 15 , 33 ) . We also calculated the average radius for each system , which is related to the width and helical heterogeneity of the filaments ( Table 1 ) . The filament radius at each frame of the trajectory was calculated from R f ¼ 1 N s ∑ i ¼ N s i ¼ 1 ð r 2 x ð i Þ þ r 2 y ð i ÞÞ 1 ∕ 2 [ 1 ] Table 1 .

Eq . 1 assumes that the filament has been centered on the origin and that the z direction is aligned with the filament axis . Cofilactin filaments are wider than bare actin filaments ( Table 1 ) , but both cofilactin systems are slightly more narrow than the initial starting configuration , consistent with the observation that the equilibrium unit cell length is slightly longer than the initial configuration . Persistence Length of Cofilactin Filaments . The persistence lengths ( L p ) of cofilactin filaments and bare actin filaments calculated from MD simulations ( ( 17 , 19 ) ; Table 1 ) indicate that the L p of actin filaments depends strongly on the conformation of the DB loop of each filament subunit ( 17 , 19 , 30 ) . In both the cofilactin and bare actin filaments a change from an unfolded loop to a folded alpha helix in the DB loop lowers the L p approxi - mately twofold . However , only in the remodeled cofilactin filament are the values in line with experimental measurements . The cofilactin - 13 filament has a significantly higher L p value com - pared to experiment , as predicted from geometric arguments ( 14 ) . Given the good agreement between experiment and MD simulations in the bare actin simulations , and the present level of agreement between the cofilactin ( DB folded ) simulation and the reported experimental cofilactin value , we conclude that the two major determinents of the overall cofilactin filament stabiltiy and stiffness are the ADF / cofilin - induced change in the filament structure and the DB loop conformation . As an additional test we simulated the cofilactin ( DB fold ) filament with bound cofilin mass density removed . While this may not represent a state extensively populated in vivo , there is increasing evidence that cofilin shifts the equilibrium of states normally populated by native actin filaments ( 12 , 13 , 15 ) . In addition , this simulation allows us to directly eliminate cofilin contributions to filament stiffness arising from the increased geometric moment , thereby revealing the mechanical properties of the remodeled cofilactin filament . This filament has a persis - tence length of 1 . 8 – 2 . 1 μ m , slightly lower than the experimental value of 2 . 2 μ m obtained for cofilactin in solution ( 14 ) . ADF / Cofilin - Induced Actin Reorganization . A number of recent ex - perimental studies of cofilactin have led to the development and support of the hypothesis that ADF / cofilin binds between subdomains 1 and 3 of actin , and that the origin of the increased flexibility of cofilactin ( compared with bare filamentous actin ) must have its roots in a modified interaction between subdomain 2 ( SD2 ) and subdomain 1 ( SD1 ) of the adjacent long - pitch helix subunit ( 10 , 13 , 15 , 32 , 34 , 35 ) . We observed during simulation that ADF / cofilin binding does indeed result in reorganization of DB loop of subdomain 2 ( SD2 ; Fig . 2 ) . Additionally , the cofilin binding surface ( Fig . S2 ) retains its initial character as well as contact between cofilin / actin of residues that were previously determined via mutagenesis experiments to be important for binding ( 36 ) . Fig . 2 .

An effective harmonic spring constant that describes the inter - action between SD2 of one actin subunit and SD1 of an adjacent intrastrand subunit ( i . e . , an i þ 2 actin subunit in the filament ) , shown schematically in Fig . 3 and based on a previous ( 19 , 25 , 37 ) 4 - site coarse - grained representation ( CG ) for actin , was obtained by fitting the distribution of bond distances between the COM of the two subdomains to a Gaussian probability dis - tribution ( 38 ) . We fit only a single Gaussian function to reproduce the CG bond distributions because the multiple - Gaussian techni - que , while clearly more accurate , sacrifices a simpler physical in - terpretation . The spring constants for the cofilactin systems are significantly smaller than the corresponding bare actin filament systems ( Table 2 ) , indicating that the interaction between SD2 of a filament subunit with SD1 of an intrastrand neighbor is greatly weakened by ADF / cofilin binding . This SD2 — SD1 inter - action has indeed been shown from CG actin filament simula - tions to be very important to the overall stability and stiffness of the filament ( 37 ) . The number of contacts between the DB loop and SD1 of adjacent intrastrand subunits , defined as being present when two C α atoms were located within 10 . 0 Å of each other , is signi - ficantly reduced with ADF / cofilin binding , thereby providing a molecular - level basis for the greatly reduced effective CG spring constant . The calculated average distance between residue Q41 of the DB loop and adjacent intrastrand subunit C - terminal residue C374 has been shown in a recent spectroscopic study to correlate with the effect of ADF / cofilin binding on actin filament dynamics ( 32 ) . This experimental spectroscopic probe length is also directly calculable via simulation , and the present MD simulations yield similar results to those from experiment . Note that since the C terminus of each actin subunit is relatively stable ( c . f . , columns four and five of Table 1 ) , the main contributing factor to the experimentally observed variations in probe length arises from the conformational flexibility of the DB loop . It is noteworthy to see that the cofilactin - 13 filament has a probe distance similar to that found in bare actin filaments . We also investigated how ADF / cofilin binding to the actin fila - ment changed during the course of the MD simulation . The simulation trajectories show that before the DB loop ( of subunit i ) moves radially away from the core of the filament , SD1 of the adjacent actin subunit ( i . e . , nearest longitudinal neighbor in i þ 2 position ) moves longitudinally away from the DB loop . Addition - ally we observe this happening in concert with ADF / cofilin ( bound at SD1 / SD3 of subunit i ) increasing its contact order with SD1 of the actin subunit in the i - 2 position , i . e . , the bound ADF / cofilin extends far enough to make an impact not only on the neighboring ( i - 2 ) SD2 , but also the neighboring ( i - 2 ) SD1 . We quantified this behavior by calculating the ratio of con - tacts that SD1 makes with the adjacent bound ADF / cofilin ( i . e . , bound to the i þ 2 actin monomer ) to the number of contacts that SD1 makes with its own bound ADF / cofilin ( Table 2 ) . The cofilactin ( DB fold ) simulation shows that ADF / cofilin binding is increased to the adjacent ADF / cofilin compared to the cofilac - tin ( DB unfold ) and ADF / cofilin - 13 simulations ( Fig . S3 ) and offers a possible mechanism for how ADF / cofilin softens actin . First , ADF / cofilin binds to a filament subunit where between SD1 and 3 ( 10 ) , which introduces structural reorganization ( altered twist and subunit tilt ) of the filament . This perturbation causes ADF / cofilin to preferentially bind SD1 and in doing so compromises stabilizing intrastrand contacts between SD2 and SD1 of neighboring , long - axis subunits . As a result , SD2 moves laterally away from the filament . The above molecular interpretation is able to account for many biochemical observations about cofilactin dynamics , including slow association kinetics and a favorable entropic component Table 2 .

Moreover , the i to i þ 2 subunit cooperativity observed in the simulations explains why binding models that incorporate nearest - neighbor cooperative inter - actions describe well the cooperative ADF / cofilin binding to actin at both the equilibrium and kinetic level ( 4 , 29 , 39 ) . Conclusions We have presented results from previously undescribed all - atom MD simulations of the cofilactin filament . By systematically varying structural features of cofilactin and additionally by com - paring to results from our previous studies of the bare actin fila - ment , we have gained important insights into cofilactin structure and dynamics . Based on the simulations results presented in the previous section , we are able to now address from a molecular perspective two key questions related to cofilactin structure and function . What Is the Structure of Actin with Bound ADF / Cofilin ? . Given the results we have previously obtained ( 17 , 19 ) for computing filament persistence lengths from all - atom MD simulations , the present calculations can be used as a means to discriminate between various cofilactin filament models . Only the cofilactin filament with a remodeled actin core [ vis - à - vis the electron microscopy experiments by Galkin et al . ( 15 ) ] and with a folded DB loop reproduces the experimentally observed increased filament flexibility with ADF / cofilin binding . Conformational transition of the DB loop from an unstructured coil to a folded helix lowers the filament L p by approximately a factor of two . Additionally , compared to bare actin and cofilactin - 13 , the two cofilactin filaments with a reduced twist were found to have much a much higher RMSD , both in the overall unit helical repeat length as well as the DB - loop region , consistent with the com - monly held notion that ADF / cofilin binding increases the overall conformational dynamics of actin . Based on these observations , we infer that the cofilactin filament with helical DB - loop is most likely ( of all the structures we considered ) to represent the predominant cofilactin structure in solution . What Is the Origin of the Observed Increase in Flexibility of Cofilactin ? . Our simulations yield general agreement ( vis - à - vis the computed persistence length values ) with the experimental observation that ADF / cofilin increases the bending flexibility of actin filaments ( 14 ) . We have identified a number of structural features that pro - vide a molecular interpretation for a large body of experimental work performed in solution with purified actin and ADF / cofilin proteins . Consistent with many previous hypotheses derived from experimental studies ( 7 , 11 , 13 – 15 , 35 ) , the different quantities computed from the MD simulations consistently show that the interactions between adjacent intrastrand subunits in actin are significantly modified by ADF / cofilin . The SD2 — SD1 intras - trand subunit interaction is significantly weakened with ADF / cofilin binding , the DB loop has increased flexibility ( increased RMSD ) , and the DB loop moves radially away from the filament core ( increase probe distance ) . Furthermore , simulations of unmodified actin filaments with bound cofilin ( cofilactin - 13 ) show a pronounced stiffening compared to both bare actin and cofilactin , as predicted from geometric arguments ( i . e . , increase in geometric moment ) ( 14 ) . It is the remodeling of the actin filament as a consequence of ADF / cofilin binding that generates the observed softening ( 14 ) . This remodeling overcomes the enhanced filament stiffness asso - ciated with an increase in mass and geometric moment ( 14 ) . Because bound cofilin does not contribute to intersubunit inter - actions , its contribution to filament stiffness through increased geometric moment could be insensitive or completely indepen - dent of its precise orientation when bound to actin . This pre - sumably explains why the precise orientation of bound cofilin influences the overall filament mechanical properties obtained from the simulations much less than does reorganization of actin . Methods The coordinates for the actin portion of the of the cofilactin filaments were based on the electron microscopy studies by Galkin et al . ( 15 ) . The cofilactin - 13 filament was generated using the Oda ( 26 ) model with the DB loop in a folded conformation is in the spirit of the “ early binding mode ” model proposed by Paavilainen et al . ( 10 ) . All of the models in this work locate co - filin between SD1 and SD3 of the actin monomer according to the Paavilai - nen et al . binding site ( 10 ) with a single cofilin bound to each actin subunit . We additionally reanalyzed some recent simulations ( 17 ) of bare actin that were based on the Oda ( 26 ) filament model with either the DB loop in a folded orunfolded conformation . The unfolded conformation used was pub - lished by Oda et al . in PDB entry 2ZWH ( 26 ) . The folded conformation was built by taking the folded DB loop from PDB entry 1J6Z ( 40 ) , splicing it into the 2ZWH structure , and relaxing the structure with an energy minimization routine . The initial coordinates for all of the filaments were obtained in an identical manner to a previously published study ( 19 ) from our group . The cofilactin filament is based on bovine actin structure 2BTF ( 41 ) and ADF / cofilin structure 1HQZ ( 42 ) . The filament was placed in a box of explicit TIP3P water molecules ( 43 ) with a minimum distance of 15 Å between the protein andtheborder oftheperiodicboundaryconditions . Thechargeofthesystem was neutralized via random placement of counterions ( KCl ) using the VMD autoionize plugin ( 44 ) . All filament simulations were performed with long - itudinal periodicity so that the first and last subunits were simulated as though they were in contact through periodic boundary conditions ( requir - ing the use of 11 subunits / cofilactin filament and 13 subunits / actin filament ) . All MD simulations were completed using NAMD 2 . 6 ( 45 ) . Potential ener - gies and forces were calculates using the CHARM22 / 27 ( 46 ) force field , and electrostatic interactions were calculated with the particle mesh Ewald sum method ( 47 ) . A 2 fs integration time step was made possible by constraining all intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the SHAKE ( 48 ) . After 100 ps pree - quilibration period was used to bring the system to 310 K by means of velocity rescaling . Next , the simulations were continued in the isobaric - iso - thermal ( constant NPT ) ensemble ( 310 K , 1 . 01325 bar ) using Langevin dy - namics and the Langevin piston method via its implementation in NAMD ( 49 , 50 ) . The damping coefficient used for Langevin dynamics was 0 . 5 ps − 1 and the Langevin piston was controlled using a piston period decay of 2 ps . Each simulation was continued for at least 50 ns , or until the unit cell length had equilibrated and sufficient equilibrated sampling of the NPT en - semble was achieved . The strategy we employed was to run the NPT simula - tion until the box length along the filament axis stabilized ( normally 30 ns ) , and then continued for an additional 20 – 40 ns “ production phase . ” The unit cell length was the slowest property to equilibrate . By comparison , the filament RMSD , system pressure , and total energy , equilibrated far faster . The initial cofilactin structure ( 15 ) is based on a fit of an atomic model to an EM density map and has a reported resolution of ∼ 20 Å . In spite of this resolution we are confident in the structures used given that we employed strict convergence criteria employed in this work , as well as the fact that we demonstrate strong sensitivity of the filament mechanics to the initial starting structure and good agreement with experimental measurements of filament mechanics . Unless otherwise noted , results reported from MD simulations of actin are based on the last 20 ns of each trajectory , and results reported from simula - tions of cofilactin are based on the last 40 ns each trajectory . The cofilactin simulations were found to be much more correlated due to their higher mass and slow internal relaxation times ; therefore a longer sampling period was used . Analysis of MD calculations and creation of all protein figures was performed using Visual Molecular Dynamics ( 44 ) . Error estimation was per - formed with a standard block - averaging technique used in molecular simu - lation ( 51 , 52 ) . For average values of a property of a single actin subunit , that were derived from filament simulations , the error for that property for each subunit was estimated via block - averaging , and the subsequent 13 error estimates were averaged to obtain an overall average error estimate .
