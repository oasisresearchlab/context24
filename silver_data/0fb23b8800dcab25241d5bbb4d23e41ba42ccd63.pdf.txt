1272 VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2015 nature neurOSCIenCe a r t I C l e S The song system has provided numerous insights into the neural basis of complex learned motor skills , especially learned vocalizations . As juveniles , zebra finches ( Taeniopygia guttata ) learn from an adult tutor to produce a precise song consisting of a number of distinct ele - ments ( syllables ) organized into repeating sequences ( motifs ) . Once they reach adulthood , birds sing stable song , but this song remains modifiable in response to altered auditory feedback 1 – 6 . Well - defined , specialized brain nuclei underlie song learning and production , greatly simplifying the study of song production . In particular , the song ‘motor’ pathway ( Fig . 1a ) includes a premotor cortical analog , HVC ( used as a proper name ) , which sends inputs to a motor cortical analog ( RA ) . RA in turn drives brainstem nuclei coordinating vocal and respiratory musculature . HVC and its connec - tions to RA are essential for singing learned song throughout life , sug - gesting that this circuitry contains key elements of the learned motor program for song 7 , 8 . RA motor neurons also receive a second major input from the prefrontal cortical - like nucleus LMAN ( lateral nucleus of the medial nidopallium ) , the outflow of a basal ganglia – thalamo - cortical circuit specialized for song ( the anterior forebrain pathway , AFP ; Fig . 1a ) . The AFP originates from a population of HVC neurons distinct from those that project to RA and , although not essential for learned song production in adults , the AFP has a well - established role in song plasticity in both juvenile and adult birds . In the early stages of song learning , lesions of LMAN prematurely crystallize song , preventing normal song acquisition 9 , 10 . In older birds singing stable song , ablation or inactivation of LMAN does not markedly affect song , but reduces vocal variability and prevents vocal plasticity 2 , 10 – 12 . These findings suggest a shift in the influence between the two major pathways driving activity in RA , allowing their balance to shape the production of learned song . As RA activity is correlated directly with multiple song features 13 , it has been widely assumed that the summation of HVC and LMAN inputs driving RA is a major contributor to learned aspects of song , and that , in adult birds , increases or decreases in the strengths of inputs to RA from HVC and LMAN may account for song plasticity . Indeed , when HVC inputs are weakened , LMAN activity becomes more influential and disrupts song substantially 7 , 14 . Taken together , these findings point to RA and the interaction of its two major inputs as a nexus for song learning , suggesting a model in which aspects of learned song are stored in HVC - RA synapses , but require LMAN - RA synapses to change . Despite this wealth of knowledge about the roles of specific nuclei in song production and learning , surprisingly little is known about how song changes are reflected in synaptic dynamics . Although there is anatomical evidence of a developmental shift in synaptic innerva - tion of RA from LMAN to HVC and concomitant changes in synaptic strength 15 – 17 , neither activity - dependent synaptic potentiation nor depression have been described at either of these synapses . We examined activity - dependent synaptic plasticity in vitro in slices from late juvenile and adult birds . We stimulated LMAN and HVC inputs concurrently using patterns based on the high - frequency bursts that occur during singing in vivo 7 , 18 , 19 . We found that such naturalistic stimulation caused changes in synaptic strength at both input pathways , and pharmacological manipulations that blocked synaptic plasticity in the slice also prevented behavioral plasticity during adult reinforcement learning . The plasticity that we observed had unique characteristics . The coactivated pathways changed in opposing directions , representing a shift in the balance of influence between the two circuits . Moreover , the direction of the changes in synaptic strength depended on the relative timing between the two inputs , suggesting that the timing of information coming through cortical - basal ganglia circuitry contains important signals for shaping motor learning . 1 Center for Integrative Neuroscience , University of California , San Francisco , San Francisco , California , USA . 2 Department of Psychiatry , University of California , San Francisco , San Francisco , California , USA . 3 Department of Physiology , University of California , San Francisco , San Francisco , California , USA . 4 Deceased .

Inputs from these nuclei converge in RA ( robust nucleus of the arcopallium ) , making it a likely locus for song learning . However , activity - dependent synaptic plasticity has never been described in either input . Using a slice preparation , we found that stimulation patterns based on singing - related activity were able to drive opposing changes in the strength of RA’s inputs : when one input was potentiated , the other was depressed , with the direction and magnitude of changes depending on the relative timing of stimulation of the inputs . Moreover , pharmacological manipulations that blocked synaptic plasticity in vitro also prevented reinforcement - driven changes to song in vivo . Together , these findings highlight the importance of precise timing in the basal ganglia – motor cortical interactions subserving adaptive motor skills . n p g © 201 5 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .

We then made whole - cell patch clamp recordings from neurons in RA whose borders were clearly identifiable under transillumina - tion ( Fig . 1c ) . Neurons were visible in RA and could be patched using conventional infrared differential interference contrast ( DIC - IR ; Fig . 1d ) , and we recorded from RA projection neurons ( PNs ) , which are characterized by their relatively slow firing rates in response to depolarizing current injection , their sag response to hyperpolarizing current pulses , their spontaneous pacemaking and / or their low spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current ( EPSC ) rates 20 . In the coronal slice , LMAN and HVC inputs enter RA approximately orthogonally and can therefore be stimulated separately 20 – 22 ( Fig . 1b ) , allowing specific activation of one or both pathways . When we tested inputs from these two pathways , we confirmed that synap - tic events evoked from HVC afferents at hyperpolarized potentials ( −75 to −80 mV ) were weakly sensitive to the NMDA receptor antag - onist 2 - amino - 5 - phosphonopentanoic acid ( AP5 ) 21 , 22 ( 84 ± 6 % of control , t ( 4 ) = −2 . 70 , P = 0 . 054 , n = 5 cells from 4 birds , paired t test ; Fig . 1e ) . Although the postsynaptic response to LMAN stimulation is largely mediated by NMDA receptor activation 21 , 22 , we were able to observe modest , but reliable , EPSCs after stimulation of the LMAN fiber tract , even at hyperpolarized potentials ( between −75 to −80 mV ; Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Such incomplete hyperpolarization block could reflect the inclusion of Mg 2 + - insensitive NMDA receptor subunits 23 . However , the events evoked by stimulation of LMAN afferents at these potentials were largely blocked by AP5 ( 6 ± 2 % of control , t ( 7 ) = −53 . 95 , P = 0 . 0000000003 , n = 8 cells from 6 birds , paired t test ; Fig . 1e ) , as has been described 20 – 22 . Plasticity in RA requires paired burst stimulation of HVC and LMAN axons Because neurons in both HVC and LMAN typically burst at very high frequencies in awake , singing birds , we first examined the synaptic currents evoked in RA by trains of high - frequency stimulation of HVC and LMAN axons . We chose four pulses at 800 Hz for HVC stimulation 18 and eight pulses at 500 Hz for LMAN stimulation based on previous studies 7 , 19 . We found that the amplitudes of the compound EPSCs resulting from burst stimulation of either HVC or LMAN axons were significantly greater than those resulting from single stimuli ( 107 ± 12 % increase in HVC peak synaptic amplitude , t ( 12 ) = 4 . 96 , P = 0 . 0003 , n = 13 cells from 9 birds ; 188 ± 38 % increase in LMAN peak synaptic amplitude , t ( 12 ) = 9 . 17 , P = 0 . 0000009 , n = 13 cells from 9 birds , paired t tests ; Fig . 2a ) . This summation suggests that the axons innervating RA PNs from HVC and LMAN are capable of following high - frequency stimulus trains and can translate these high rates of firing into an increased release of glutamate that is observable postsynaptically . The two inputs to RA both originate in HVC ( Fig . 1a ) . HVC sends a direct , monosynaptic projection to RA . In addition , a separate population of HVC neurons sends a polysynaptic projection via the song cortical – basal ganglia loop , whose outflow gives rise to the LMAN - to - RA projection . Thus , during singing , RA is likely to receive activity coming from LMAN in close temporal proximity to activity coming from HVC . Because HVC - to - RA activity is required for structured song and LMAN firing is required for song plasticity , plasticity may require coactivation of the two pathways . To test this hypothesis , we stimulated both pathways using high frequency naturalistic burst rates while holding RA PNs in voltage clamp ( stimulation was paired eight times at 0 . 5 Hz ; Fig . 2b ) . After this pairing , we found that the amplitudes of synaptic responses of both input pathways to single test stimuli were altered ( Fig . 2c – e ) . LMAN responses following paired stimulation were reliably stronger ( 127 ± 10 % of control , t ( 6 ) = 2 . 86 , P = 0 . 035 , n = 7 cells from 6 birds , paired t test ; Fig . 2d , e ) , whereas the average strength of the HVC synapses decreased in amplitude ( 54 ± 16 % of control , t ( 6 ) = 2 . 76 , P = 0 . 033 , n = 7 cells from 7 slices from 6 birds , paired t test ; Fig . 2c , e ) . This change in synaptic strength could be observed for ≥ 30 min ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Although inhibition was not blocked in these experiments , in a separate set of experiments , blockade of inhibition did not alter the amplitude or timing of EPSCs and did not prevent either HVC or LMAN inputs from changing strength ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Thus , inhibition does not appear to be required for the changes in synaptic strength that we observed . In adult birds singing well - learned songs , LMAN activity con - tributes variability to learned features of song , but has little influ - ence on the mean value of song features such as pitch 11 . However , in a reinforcement learning procedure in which birds learn to adjust their songs to avoid aversive auditory feedback , LMAN contributes an offset responsible for the early adaptive change during aversive reinforcement 4 , 5 , 24 . An increase in the strength of appropriate LMAN synapses , concurrent with a decrease in HVC synaptic strength could , allow LMAN activity to drive early adaptive changes . After simultaneous stimulation of HVC and LMAN , the paired pulse ratio ( 50 - ms interval between pulses ) of the HVC inputs increased ( 23 % ± 10 % increase , t ( 6 ) = −2 . 56 , P = 0 . 043 , n = 7 cells from 7 slices , from 6 birds , paired t test ) , but did not change for the LMAN inputs ( 0 . 8 % ± 4 % increase , t ( 6 ) = 0 . 09 , P = 0 . 93 , n = 7 cells , from 7 slices , from 6 birds , paired t test ; Fig . 2f ) .

( a ) Stimulation of either HVC ( black ) or LMAN ( red ) at high frequencies ( 800 and 500 Hz respectively ) drove a significantly larger summed current than single stimulations , suggesting increased glutamate release after burst stimulation , even at these high frequencies ( HVC , 107 ± 12 % increase , t ( 12 ) = 4 . 96 , P = 0 . 0003 , n = 13 ; LMAN , 188 ± 38 % increase , P = 0 . 0000009 , n = 13 cells from 9 birds , paired t tests ) . ( b ) Schematic of protocol used for plasticity induction . HVC and LMAN inputs were paired eight times at 0 . 5 Hz , with HVC driven at 800 Hz and LMAN driven at 500 Hz . After the induction protocol , LMAN inputs showed a modest increase in synaptic strength ( 127 ± 10 % of control , t ( 6 ) = 2 . 86 , P = 0 . 035 , n = 7 cells from 6 birds , paired t test ) , whereas HVC inputs showed a large decrease in synaptic strength ( 54 ± 16 % of control , t ( 6 ) = 2 . 76 , P = 0 . 033 , n = 7 cells from 6 birds , paired t test ) . ( c – e ) A representative experiment ( c , d ) and summary data ( e ) are shown . ( f ) The induction protocol increased the PPR of HVC inputs ( 23 ± 10 % increase , t ( 6 ) = −2 . 56 , P = 0 . 043 , 7 cells from 6 birds , paired t test ) , but did not affect the PPR of LMAN inputs ( 0 . 8 ± 4 % , t ( 6 ) = 0 . 09 , P = 0 . 93 , n = 7 cells from 6 birds , paired t test ) . All values are mean ± s . e . m . changes in LMAN synaptic strength . Furthermore , as these changes could be observed despite the cell being held between −70 and −80 mV during the induction protocol , postsynaptic spiking does not seem to be a necessary component of this plasticity . Although we found lasting changes in synaptic strength after paired burst stimulation of HVC inputs and LMAN inputs , it was not clear whether activation of both pathways was required for plasticity or whether one pathway was solely responsible for the changes observed in both pathways . Song plasticity is arrested in both juveniles and adults when LMAN is absent 2 , 5 , 9 , 25 , 26 , so this plasticity could either depend solely on the activity of LMAN or on the coactivation of both pathways . We tested whether independent burst stimulation of HVC or LMAN was capable of inducing lasting changes in synaptic strength . Burst stimulation of either HVC inputs alone or LMAN inputs alone produced no lasting changes in either the stimulated or unstimulated pathway ( HVC stimulation only : LMAN , 99 ± 0 . 1 % of control , t ( 2 ) = −0 . 19 , P = 0 . 87 , n = 3 cells from 2 birds ; HVC , 97 ± 2 % of control , t ( 5 ) = −2 . 06 , P = 0 . 09 , n = 6 cells from 5 birds ; LMAN stimulation only : LMAN , 97 ± 2 % of control , t ( 7 ) = −1 . 24 , P = 0 . 25 , n = 8 cells from 6 birds ; HVC , 94 ± 5 % of control , t ( 4 ) = −1 . 37 , P = 0 . 24 , n = 5 cells from 3 birds , paired t tests ; Fig . 3a , b ) . Thus , under the conditions studied , coactivation of the two pathways was critical for the sustained changes in synaptic strength that we observed . In adults , singing - related activity of HVC neurons is dominated by sparse high - frequency bursts 18 , 27 , and prior work has suggested that the burst firing in LMAN is important for song plasticity 6 . LMAN bursts occur during the conditions in which song plasticity has been elicited 4 , 19 , 24 , 28 , and manipulations that eliminate burst firing in LMAN also eliminate song plasticity 6 . However , LMAN neurons can switch between bursting and single spikes depending on behavioral context 19 , whereas X projecting HVC neurons ( HVC - X ) do not switch firing modes 27 . To examine whether LMAN bursts are required for synaptic plasticity in vitro , we paired burst stimulation of HVC axons with single stimulation of LMAN axons . Pairing bursts of activity in HVC axons with single stimulation of LMAN axons caused a transient increase in both HVC and LMAN inputs , but did not result in lasting changes in the strength of either pathway ( HVC : 98 ± 3 % of control , t ( 3 ) = −0 . 72 , P = 0 . 53 ; LMAN : 97 ± 4 % of control , t ( 3 ) = −0 . 83 , P = 0 . 47 , n = 4 cells from 4 slices from 4 birds , paired t tests ; Fig . 3c ) , demonstrating that burst stimulation of LMAN was required for changes in the strength of the two pathways . Furthermore , the high - frequency bursting observed in vivo seemed to be necessary , as stimulation of both pathways with slower stimulation frequencies ( 100 Hz ) failed to elicit long - lasting changes in synaptic strength ( HVC : 99 ± 10 % of control , t ( 3 ) = −0 . 09 , P = 0 . 93 , LMAN 107 ± 8 % of control , t ( 3 ) = 0 . 87 , P = 0 . 45 , n = 4 cells from 2 birds , paired t tests ; Fig . 3d ) . Latency between pathways controls strength and valence of plasticity Many forms of plasticity depend on timing 29 , and given that birdsong is a carefully coordinated sequence of precisely timed motor gestures , such timing - dependent neural plasticity has been a key component of many models of song learning 30 , 31 . We next examined whether altering the timing of the HVC stimulation relative to LMAN stimulation could influ - ence the synaptic plasticity that we observed ( Fig . 4 ) . We applied HVC burst stimulation either before ( negative lags , ∆ t < 0 ms ) or after LMAN stimulation ( positive lags , ∆ t > 0 ms ) , at separations of up to 500 ms ( Fig . 4a ) . The resulting plasticity was bidirectional , with a marked dependence on latency between the two stimulations . Little change in the strength of either pathway was observed when LMAN stimulation led HVC stimulation by > 50 ms ( Fig . 4b , e ) . However , in experiments in which HVC and LMAN were activated near simultaneously ( Fig . 4b , d ) , or in which HVC stimulation led LMAN activation by 50 ms ( Fig . 4b ) , the amplitude of HVC inputs to RA decreased , whereas the amplitude of the LMAN inputs increased . The magnitude of plasticity in both pathways decreased when HVC led LMAN by a brief time interval ( ~ 75 ms ) . Further increases in this interval ( HVC leading LMAN by ~ 100 ms ; Fig . 4b , c ) reversed the direction of plasticity such that HVC inputs increased in amplitude and the amplitude of LMAN inputs to RA decreased ( at −100 - ms lag : HVC , 135 ± 12 % of control , t ( 4 ) = 2 . 91 , P = 0 . 044 ; LMAN , 46 ± 16 % of control , t ( 4 ) = −3 . 34 , P = 0 . 029 , n = 5 cells from 5 birds ) . Finally , when HVC led LMAN by > 150 ms , synaptic strengths were again unchanged ( Fig . 4b ) . Thus , the relative timing of inputs to RA determines both the strength and direction of changes in synaptic inputs . Moreover , the magnitude of change in each pathway was negatively correlated with the magnitude of change in the other pathway ( R 2 = 0 . 318 , P = 0 . 00000073 ) , suggesting an approximately homeostatic principle helping conserve excitatory drive to RA . n p g © 201 5 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nature neurOSCIenCe VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2015 1275 a r t I C l e S Pharmacology of timing - and burst - dependent plasticity in RA We next focused on what mechanisms might underlie the changes in synaptic strength that we observed . We began by examining the plasticity induced by simultaneous activation of the two input path - ways ( 0 - ms lag ; Fig . 5a ) . Given that the response seen after LMAN stimulation is predominantly mediated by NMDA receptors 21 , 22 , we first examined whether activation of NMDA receptors was a neces - sary component for the changes in synaptic strength that we elicited . As AP5 blocked the synaptic currents evoked by LMAN stimulation , these currents could of course no longer be measured . However , in the presence of AP5 , paired simultaneous stimulation of LMAN and HVC resulted in a lasting depression of the HVC pathway , similar to that observed when the two pathways were stimulated in the absence of NMDA receptor antagonists ( 56 ± 10 % of control , t ( 3 ) = −4 . 28 , P = 0 . 023 , n = 4 cells from 3 birds , paired t test ; Fig . 5b ) . This suggests that , despite LMAN burst stimulation being a necessary component for the plasticity observed in the HVC - RA synapses ( Figs . 2c , e , and 3a , c , d ) , activation of the postsynaptic NMDA receptors that mediate LMAN inputs does not appear to be required for the depression of HVC synaptic inputs that resulted from such paired stimulation . As NMDA receptor activity was not necessary for the plasticity that we observed , we next examined the calcium dependence of the plasticity more generally . We stimulated both pathways after intra - cellular diffusion of the calcium chelator 1 , 2 - bis ( o - aminophenoxy ) ethane - N , N , N ′ , N ′ - tetraacetic acid ( BAPTA , 10 mM ) to block changes in intracellular calcium in the postsynaptic cells . Under these condi - tions , synaptic strength in either pathway showed no lasting changes , suggesting that a rise in intracellular calcium is a key component in the bidirectional heterosynaptic plasticity that we observed ( BAPTA : HVC , 98 ± 23 % of control , t ( 3 ) = −0 . 10 , P = 0 . 92 ; LMAN , 107 ± 10 % of control , t ( 3 ) = 0 . 68 , P = 0 . 55 , n = 4 cells from 3 birds , paired t test ; Fig . 5c ) . Taken together , these findings imply that calcium increases were required , but did not occur via NMDA receptor – mediated mech - anisms . Much or all of this increase in intracellular calcium appeared to be mediated by release from intracellular calcium stores , as block - ade of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticu - lum with thapsigargin ( 1 µ M ) prevented synaptic plasticity ( HVC , 98 ± 7 % of control , t ( 3 ) = 0 . 30 , P = 0 . 79 ; LMAN , 101 ± 3 % of control , t ( 3 ) = 0 . 20 , P = 0 . 85 , n = 4 cells from 2 birds ; Fig . 5d ) . The requirement for high - frequency burst activation of both HVC and LMAN ( Fig . 3 ) suggested that the observed plasticity may depend on coordinated release of glutamate after a burst of presynaptic activ - ity , although not necessarily on the activation of NMDA receptors . We considered candidates for other glutamate receptors that could be specifically activated by burst stimulation , including receptors activated by spillover or synaptic crosstalk that can occur during burst stimulation of axons 32 . These include metabotropic glutamate receptors ( mGluRs ) , which are often found extrasynaptically 33 . In other systems , group II mGluRs ( mGlur2 and mGlur3 ) have been implicated in a presynaptic form of depression in cortical and hippocampal synapses 34 and can potentiate NMDA recep - tors 35 . In songbirds , group II mGluRs in particular show high lev - els of mRNA expression in HVC , LMAN and RA 36 , making them potential candidates for the plasticity that we elicited . When we bath - applied the group II mGluR antagonist LY341495 and paired burst stimulation of the two pathways , we found no lasting changes in synaptic strength in either pathway ( HVC , 96 ± 5 % of control , t ( 3 ) = −0 . 73 , P = 0 . 52 ; LMAN , 103 ± 10 % of control , t ( 3 ) = 0 . 24 , P = 0 . 82 , n = 4 cells from 4 birds , paired t test ; Fig . 5e ) . Furthermore , bath application of a group II mGlur agonist ( LY354740 ) mimicked the simultaneous pairing of HVC and LMAN stimulation by causing decreased HVC synaptic strength ( 87 ± 6 % , t ( 5 ) = 3 . 54 , P = 0 . 016 , n = 6 cells from 5 birds , paired t test ) in combination with an increased paired pulse ratio ( PPR , pre : 0 . 98 ± 6 % , post : 1 . 29 ± 13 % , t ( 5 ) = −2 . 91 , P = 0 . 033 , n = 6 cells from 5 birds , paired t test ) while increasing LMAN synaptic strength ( 125 % ± 8 % of control , t ( 5 ) = −3 . 11 , P = 0 . 026 , n = 6 cells from 5 birds , paired t test ) without affect - ing PPR ( pre : 1 . 01 ± 0 . 05 , post : 1 . 02 ± 0 . 08 , t ( 5 ) = −0 . 12 , P = 0 . 91 , a b Pairing , HVC bursts only c No stim LMAN ( n = 8 ) HVC ( n = 5 ) N o r m a li z ed sy nap t i c s t r eng t h Time ( min ) HVC ( n = 6 ) LMAN ( n = 3 ) Time ( min ) n = 4 N o r m a li z ed sy nap t i c s t r eng t h LMAN stimulation only HVC stimulation only Time ( min ) N o r m a li z ed sy nap t i c s t r eng t h d Pairing , 100 Hz stimulation – 5 8 × 100 Hz LMAN LMAN LMAN LMAN 4 × 100 Hz 4 × 800 Hz 8 × 500 Hz 4 × 800 Hz HVC HVC HVC 0 5 10 15 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 1 . 2 1 . 6 2 . 0 No stim n = 4 HVC LMAN HVC LMAN – 5 0 5 10 15 20 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 Time ( min ) – 5 0 5 10 15 20 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 1 . 6 1 . 8 N o r m a li z ed sy nap t i c s t r eng t h – 5 0 10 20 30 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 Figure 3 High - frequency bursting in both pathways is required for induction of plasticity .

Taken together , these data show that the form of plasticity that we elicited was NMDA independent , but required both mGluR2 / 3 activation and an increase in postsynaptic calcium through release from intracellular calcium stores . Thus , one interpretation of the requirement for high - frequency burst stimulation is that spillover of glutamate from LMAN axon terminals may activate extrasynaptic mGlur2 / 3 receptors . We next examined whether the mechanisms that underlie synaptic plasticity were similar regardless of the latency between HVC and LMAN stimulation or the valence of plasticity ( Fig . 5f – j ) . The pattern of paired pulse depression at −100 - ms lag was opposite to that found when stimulation was paired at 0 - ms lag in that LMAN showed signif - icant potentiation of the PPR , whereas the HVC PPR was unchanged ( HVC : pre , 1 . 07 ± 0 . 10 ; post , 1 . 00 ± 0 . 09 ; t ( 4 ) = −1 . 08 , P = 0 . 34 , n = 5 cells from 3 birds ; LMAN : pre , 0 . 91 ± 0 . 12 ; post , 1 . 21 ± 0 . 05 ; t ( 4 ) = 0 . 03 , P = 0 . 028 , n = 5 cells from 3 birds , paired t tests ) .

Thus , the lack of behavioral plasticity during LY341495 infusions is not likely to reflect ‘masking’ of LMAN inputs , as in a previous study 5 . The blockade of pitch shift occurred whether the pitch was shifted up ( n = 6 experiments in 4 birds ) or down ( n = 4 experiments in 4 birds ) . At the end of the experiments , muscimol - BODIPY ( 1 mM ) was infused , and we fixed the brains for histology . Muscimol - BODIPY revealed that the drug spread to encompass RA ( Fig . 6e ) , confirming the targeting of our microdialysis probes . These results show that blockade of the receptors required for synaptic plasticity in the slice was also able prevent adaptive changes in song in response to aversive stimulation . DISCUSSION We found a form of synaptic plasticity in which excitatory inputs to a motor nucleus from two separate pathways with distinct functional roles in song production , HVC and LMAN , were altered in opposing directions . This plasticity depended on concurrent burst activation in both LMAN and HVC axons , activation of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors ( mGluR2 / 3 ) , and increases in intracellular cal - cium from intracellular stores . Furthermore , the relative timing between stimulation of bursting in the two pathways determined the strength and direction of plasticity . Plasticity rules depending on the timing of activity between a syn - aptic input and an evoked spike ( spike timing – dependent plasticity ) have been described in many systems and can be modulated by both the frequency and timing of synaptic inputs 37 , 38 . Moreover , depend - ing on the neuronal class , identical timings can result in Hebbian or anti - Hebbian learning rules 37 , 38 . The plasticity described here depends not on spiking , but rather on timed activation of different input pathways ( termed input timing – dependent plasticity , ITDP ) 39 , 40 . The heterosynaptic ITDP we elicited exhibited some previously unknown properties .

( a , b ) Specific syllables ( denoted by letters ) could be targeted with negative reinforcement ( WN ) contingent on the fundamental frequency ( expanded view of targeted syllable in b ) , which drove changes in the pitch of targeted syllables . ( c , d ) Adult birds reliably shifted the fundamental frequency of targeted syllables when PBS was infused through microdialysis cannulae , whereas infusion of the mGlur2 / 3 blocker LY341495 into RA prevented learned changes in pitch ( 0 . 11 ± 0 . 07 % of control , t ( 9 ) = 5 . 14 , P = 0 . 0006 , n = 10 experiments in 5 birds ) .

Taken together , these results indicate that activation of mGluR2 / 3 receptors and a resulting increase in intracellular calcium is a prerequisite for both directions of plasticity . Contribution of mGlur2 / 3 receptors to adult pitch shift learning Given that the group II mGluR blocker LY341495 was able to pre - vent lasting changes in synaptic strength in slices , we next examined whether or not group II mGluRs could influence behavioral changes induced by negative reinforcement learning . Previous work has shown that playback of a loud burst of white noise ( WN ) contingent on the frequency of a targeted syllable can drive adaptive changes in frequency to avoid the aversive stimulus 4 , 25 , 28 ( for example , see Fig . 6a – c ) . We used this procedure to investigate whether the mGlurs required for synaptic plasticity in vitro were also required for adap - tive behavioral plasticity . During aversive training experiments , we infused either phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) or the mGlur2 / 3 antagonist LY341495 through microdialysis cannulae implanted bilaterally in RA . A target syllable was then selected ( Fig . 6a ) and an aversive stimulus ( white noise , WN ) was delivered when the bird sang above or below a target pitch ( for example , see Fig . 6b ) . As reported previously , in control conditions during saline infusion , birds shifted the fundamental frequency ( FF ) of the targeted syllable to avoid WN . During PBS infusion in RA , aversive training led to an adaptive shift in the FF ( mean 1 . 8 ± 0 . 32 % shift in FF ; Fig . 6d ) . However , the adaptive shift achieved during training was signifi - cantly reduced after infusion of the mGlur2 / 3 antagonist LY341495 ( 0 . 11 ± 0 . 07 % , t ( 9 ) = 5 . 14 , P = 0 . 0006 , n = 10 experiments in 5 birds ; Fig . 6d ) . The absence of a pitch shift was not a result of a reduction in behavioral variability , as LY341495 did not alter pitch variability of the targeted syllables ( CV pre , 0 . 017 ± 0 . 003 ; CV in LY341495 , 0 . 016 ± 0 . 004 ; t ( 4 ) = 0 . 89 , P = 0 . 42 n = 5 syllables in 5 birds ) . These results suggest that LMAN inputs continue to modulate RA activity and song output via NMDA receptor . Moreover , LY341495 did not n p g © 201 5 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .

Notably , the direction of plasticity could be inverted by changing the relative timing between activation of the two pathways . Plasticity of the two inputs was not symmetrical around zero offset between stimulation of the two inputs , but was instead centered around a temporal offset ( ~ −75 ms , HVC leading LMAN ) that was near the lag observed in anaesthetized recordings 41 and near the in vivo estimate for vocal - motor mirroring in LMAN 42 . Synaptic and song plasticity Prior work has suggested that song learning is encoded in RA , partic - ularly in the HVC - RA synapses , whereas LMAN synapses are required for plasticity . However , LMAN - dependent synaptic plasticity has not been reported previously in adult birds . We found , for the first time to the best of our knowledge , plasticity of RA inputs . Moreover , this plas - ticity involved opposing changes in the synaptic strengths of the two inputs . Learned song requires synaptic inputs from HVC , as lesions of HVC - RA inputs cause song to revert to a juvenile - like state 7 , and firing rates of RA neurons can be correlated with multiple aspects of song structure , including pitch 13 . In contrast , in adult finches , LMAN is not required for singing crystallized song 2 , 9 , although it contrib - utes to song variability 11 and is required for multiple forms of juve - nile and adult plasticity . When LMAN is silenced in juveniles , song learning abruptly stops 9 , 10 , 12 , and birds develop more robust HVC synaptic inputs than birds with intact LMAN 16 . Direct microstimula - tion of LMAN can also alter song pitch and amplitude 43 , suggesting that such LMAN - mediated influences on RA spiking may underlie the pitch shifts observed during LMAN - dependent reinforcement training . Notably , the influence of the two inputs to RA also shifts during this reinforcement learning procedure : initially , both HVC and LMAN inputs contribute to the learned pitch shift , which is then followed by consolidation , where the direct motor pathway from HVC to RA maintains the adaptive pitch shift even in the absence of LMAN activity 4 , 24 . The plasticity observed in our slice preparation presents a possible mechanism by which appropriately timed activity can increase or decrease the strength of the HVC motor pathway , with a coordinated change in the influence of the AFP . Ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors in the song system The two excitatory inputs to RA are largely segregated by their iono - tropic receptors : the direct pathway from HVC is predominantly mediated by AMPA receptors and the inputs from LMAN are almost exclusively made up of NMDA receptors 21 , 22 . Our results demonstrate an NMDA - independent form of synaptic plasticity that requires acti - vation of both RA input paths ( HVC and LMAN ) , mGluR2 / 3 receptor activation and intracellular calcium changes . Metabotropic glutamate receptors have been mapped previously in the song system 36 , but have rarely been examined otherwise . In situ localization of mRNA for these receptors shows strong expression in RA , HVC and LMAN 36 , suggesting potential expression postsyn - aptically in RA neurons and / or presynaptically in HVC and LMAN axon terminals . In other systems , these receptors have been impli - cated in timing - dependent depression of glutamatergic synapses 34 and can cause calcium - dependent increases in NMDA - mediated currents 35 . To test the contributions of metabotropic receptors , we used selective mGlur2 / 3 receptor agonists and antagonists to demon - strate that activation of these receptors contributes to the bidirectional heterosynaptic plasticity that we observed in slices . Moreover , we found a link between mGluR - dependent synaptic plasticity in RA and behavioral plasticity : adult birds trained to shift their pitch through aversive reinforcement did not shift their pitch when mGlur2 / 3 antag - onists were infused into RA in vivo . Burst timing , sources of timing differences and implications for song production In vitro , we found that LMAN burst stimulation was required for synaptic plasticity in RA and that the relative timing between burst stimulation of HVC and LMAN axons determined both the magni - tude and direction of plasticity . Prior work suggests that naturally varying differences in the arrival times of the inputs from the two pathways do occur during singing . Although HVC neurons project - ing to RA fire stereotyped , precisely timed high - frequency bursts of activity in every rendition 18 , LMAN neurons fire variably timed bursts both during juvenile song acquisition 7 and in the solitary song conditions in which most adult plasticity experiments have been performed 19 . Although individual LMAN neurons burst preferentially in certain temporal windows relative to song , bursts may or may not occur during any individual rendition , and their precise timing in these windows varies from rendition to rendition . Thus , the relative timing of events from the direct HVC - RA motor pathway and the AFP - mediated LMAN - RA pathway varies naturally from rendition to rendition during normal song production . There are a number of possible sources of timing differences between HVC - RA and LMAN - RA inputs . First , the architecture of HVC is such that HVC - RA neurons drive HVC - X neurons as well as inhibitory interneurons ( HVC - INT ) , and HVC - INT primarily influence HVC - X neurons 44 . Such functional connectivity suggests that HVC - X neurons provide a readout of the activity of HVC - RA , such that timing differ - ences between HVC - RA and LMAN - RA inputs could emerge during the propagation of activity through the multiple nuclei of the AFP . Although strong electrical stimulation of HVC can evoke activity in LMAN as quickly as 10 – 30 ms ( ref . 45 ) , simultaneous recordings of spontaneous and bird’s own song – evoked activity in RA and LMAN in anesthetized animals have shown that RA and LMAN spiking is coherent even at late time points , with a peak near 65 ms ( ranging from 10 – 150 ms ) , resulting from common input from HVC 41 . Second , propagation of activity may be modulated in the AFP . Recordings from behaving birds have shown that there is precisely timed activity in HVC - X projection neurons during singing , but variably timed events are apparent in Area X 27 and LMAN 19 , and prior studies have shown that manipulation of dopamine can alter propagation times through the circuit 46 . Third , auditory - vocal mirroring experiments have raised the possibility that some HVC - X neurons fire identically timed activity during song production and auditory playback 47 , 48 , suggesting that they may be temporally offset from the direct HVC - RA motor com - mands . In contrast , LMAN neurons have a longer vocal - motor mirror - ing latency 42 . These provide yet another possible source of temporal offsets between HVC - RA and LMAN - RA drive . Regardless of their origins , variable delays between HVC and LMAN bursts in vivo have direct implications for how LMAN activity modulates the HVC - RA direct motor signals to change song . LMAN is known to be a key source of motor variability 7 , 11 , 12 , and drives much of the initial pitch shift during reinforcement learning 4 , 5 , 24 . For LMAN to bias the direct motor command from HVC driving song , LMAN firing must occur in some time window so as to be integrated with the HVC - RA motor command it biases . The synaptic learning rule we found in vitro suggests that such closely timed pairings will lead to an increase in the influence of the LMAN pathway and a con - comitant decrease in the influence in the HVC pathway , which could contribute to the expression of adult reinforcement learning 4 , 24 . n p g © 201 5 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nature neurOSCIenCe VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2015 1279 a r t I C l e S In contrast , if HVC - RA inputs drive some song element before LMAN - RA inputs arrive , no acute LMAN - mediated biasing is pos - sible for that element . Nonetheless , we observed that , at longer lags between HVC - RA and LMAN - RA inputs ( for example , −100 ms ) , stimulation still altered synaptic strength in vitro , potentially allow - ing changes in these inputs in the absence of acute perturbation of the song . Future studies that elucidate the relative timing between HVC - RA events and LMAN - RA events could help to reconcile how LMAN can contribute to the many roles it has been suggested to have , including propagation of mirror neuron - like efference copies 48 , the implementation of a ‘forward model’ for reinforcement learning 49 , 50 , generating variability in motor output 12 , 43 and actively biasing song production 4 , 24 , 43 . The in vitro plasticity rule described here is consistent with many observed aspects of song learning , including a greater influence of LMAN initially during learning , the gradual shift toward control by the direct motor pathway from HVC 4 , 5 , 24 , the requirement of LMAN for changes in learned aspects of syllable structure in adults 4 , 24 and the requirement for timed LMAN bursts in adult vocal motor plasticity 6 . In addition , the learning rule seen in vitro in the inputs to the song motor cortex analog RA may have very general implications for motor learning and its dependence on cortical – basal ganglia interactions and their timing .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nature neurOSCIenCe doi : 10 . 1038 / nn . 4078 ONLINE METHODS Subjects . Subjects were male zebra finches ( Taeniopygia guttata ) . Their care and treatment were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California , San Francisco . Slice preparation . Brain slices were prepared from late juvenile ( 70 – 90 ) and adult ( 90 + ) birds raised in our breeding colony , or purchased from an outside supplier . Birds were anesthetized with isoflurane , and rapidly decapitated according to protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California , San Francisco . Brains were rapidly dissected in an ice cold cutting solution consisting of ( in mM ) : 125 C 5 H 14 ClNO , 3 MgSO 4 , 0 . 5 CaCl 2 , 2 . 5 KCl , 25 NaHCO 3 , and 35 glucose . In some solutions , 0 . 3 mM ascorbate was added . Approximately coronal sections were cut on a Leica VT1000 microtome , and incubated at 32 – 38 °C in recording artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( consisting of ( in mM ) : 125 NaCl , 1 MgSO 4 , 2 CaCl 2 , 2 . 5 KCl , 25 NaHCO 3 , and 35 glucose ) for 30 – 60 min . Slices were then maintained at room temperature in well - oxygenated ( 95 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2 ) holding chambers until transferred to the recording chamber . electrophysiology . All recordings were made in oxygenated solution which consisted of standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid , heated to near - physiological temperature ( 35 – 38 °C , TC - 324B , Warner Instruments ) . Glass electrodes ( 3 – 8 M Ω ) were filled with intracellular solution containing ( in mM ) 120 potassium gluconate , 0 . 1 EGTA , 40 HEPES , 5 KCl , 0 . 3 MgCl 2 , 2 K 2 ATP , 0 . 5 Tris - GTP , and 10 sodium creatinine . When noted , potassium gluconate was replaced with potas - sium Methylsulfonate , and D - 890 ( 1 µ M ) and QX - 314 ( 1 µ M ) were added to the intracellular solution to inhibit K + , Ca 2 + and Na + currents , respectively . In some cases 0 . 5 % biocytin , or Alexa - 594 was added to the pipette solution for identifi - cation of neuronal morphology after recording . Targeted recordings were made under DIC - IR visualization using an Olympus BX - 51 microscope and a camera ( DAGE - MTI ) . The borders of RA are easily identifiable in the slice . Recordings were made within these borders from apparent projection neurons ( projecting to NXIIts , nucleus retroambigualis or paraambigualis ) , which could be identified physiologically by their spontaneous firing in vitro , slow firing and adaptation in response to depolarizing currents steps , and prominent sag current 20 . Unless otherwise stated , cells were held at −75 to −80 mV for the duration of the experi - ments , including during synaptic stimulation , to keep the cell at the Cl − reversal potential to prevent GABA A mediated currents from contaminating the traces . This was sufficient to prevent the high frequency inhibitory postsynaptic currents in RA PNs from being apparent , and further application of gabazine ( SR - 95531 ) , had only a small effect on baseline holding currents . Furthermore , gabazine did not affect the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials , or the potentiation and depression that we observed ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Recordings were made with a Multiclamp 700B ( Molecular Devices ) , controlled by PClamp 10 . 0 software or by custom acquisition software written in Matlab . Current and voltage clamp data was acquired at 10 kHz , and filtered at 3 kHz . Stimulation . Concentric bipolar or matrix ( 100 µ m ) stimulating electrodes ( FHC ) were placed in the afferent tracts from HVC and LMAN ( Fig . 1b ) . HVC and LMAN showed comparable pharmacology to previous studies , where LMAN inputs were blocked by AP5 , and HVC neurons were less AP5 sensitive 21 , 22 . A smaller , but measureable , LMAN - mediated EPSC was observed even at hyperpolarized potentials ( −75 to −80 mV ; Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , allow - ing recording of both pathways at identical input voltages . When applying burst stimulation , HVC was driven at 800 Hz four times 18 , and LMAN was driven at 500 Hz eight times 7 , 19 . Bursts were presented eight times at 0 . 5 Hz , while holding the cell in voltage clamp at −75 to −80 mV . Although LMAN neurons can display significant variability in their burst patterns and timing in vivo , in these experiments these parameters were fixed . Burst stimulation of either path - way was presented either individually , or by pairing activation of both pathways at various latencies . Cells were then monitored for at least 20 min to be included in the data set , and were excluded if series resistance changed by > 20 % . After a stable baseline of 3 – 5 min was obtained , induction protocols were performed , and the two input pathways were stimulated alternately every minute , or else stimulated five times ( 0 . 5 Hz ) at 5 - min intervals . Results were grouped into 5 - min time periods so that the protocols were comparable . Cells had to be stable for at least 15 min after stimulation so as to be included in the data set , but effects could been seen out to longer periods ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Significance for potentiation experiments was tested with a paired t test between the average of the control period and the final 5 - min time window to test whether a lasting change was observed . Slices were discarded after pharmacological or plastic - ity experiments . Data distribution was assumed to be normal , but this was not formally tested . Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments . No statistical methods were used to predeter - mine sample sizes , but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications 21 , 51 , 52 . All t tests were reported and two - tailed . Animals were not grouped , and therefore no randomization was performed . When mentioned , drugs were bath applied at the following concentrations : LY341495 ( 20 nM ) , AP5 ( 25 µ M ) , gabazine ( 10 µ M ) , thapsigargin ( 1 µ M ) . All drugs were obtained from Sigma - Aldrich or Abcam Biochemicals . Histology . Birds were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane before being trans - cardially perfused with 0 . 9 % saline ( wt / vol ) , followed by 3 . 7 % formaldehyde ( wt / vol ) in 0 . 025 M phosphate buffer ( PB ) . Brains were postfixed for 4 – 24 h , then cryoprotected in 30 % sucrose ( wt / vol ) . 40 - µ m saggital sections were cut on a freezing microtome . Retrodialysis for in vivo behavior experiments . For in vivo microdialysis experiments to examine behavioral plasticity , cannulae for were targeted to RA bilaterally with stereotaxic coordinates as described previously 53 , and PBS or the mGlur2 / 3 antagonist LY341495 ( 100 - 200 nM ) was infused into RA through microdialysis probes ( CMA - 7 , Harvard Apparatus ) . After the final experiment , birds were infused with fluorescent muscimol - BODIPY ( Life Technologies , 1 mM ) to confirm targeting of the cannulae and drug spread to RA . Pitch shift training . Birds were kept in sound isolating chambers ( Acoustic Systems ) , and provided with food and water ad libitum . Brief bursts of white noise were played back in response to detection of specific syllables with custom soft - ware written in LabView ( National Instruments ) . As previously described 25 these techniques reveal a form of adult song plasticity mediated by adaptive changes in the pitch of the fundamental frequency of targeted syllables . 10 – 20 % trials were ‘catch’ trials , where white noise was not played regardless of the fundamental frequency of the syllable . Only syllables in these trials were analyzed in order to examine learning trajectories . A Supplementary methods checklist is available . 51 .
