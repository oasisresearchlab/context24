The semi ﬂ exible polymers ﬁ lamentous actin ( F ‑ actin ) and intermediate ﬁ laments ( IF ) both form complex networks within the cell , and together are key determinants of cellular stiffness . While the mechanics of F ‑ actin networks together with stiff microtubules have been characterized , the interplay between F ‑ actin and IF networks is largely unknown , necessitating the study of composite networks using mixtures of semi ﬂ exible biopolymers . We employ bulk rheology in a simpli ﬁ ed in vitro system to uncover the fundamental mechanical interactions between networks of the 2 semi ﬂ exible polymers , F ‑ actin and vimentin IF . Surprisingly , co ‑ polymerization of actin and vimentin can produce composite networks either stronger or weaker than pure F ‑ actin networks . We show that this effect occurs through steric constraints imposed by IF on F ‑ actin during network formation and ﬁ lament crosslinking , highlighting novel emergent behavior in composite semi ﬂ exible networks . Introduction The biopolymer ﬁlaments ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) , micro - tubules , and intermediate ﬁlaments ( IF ) form networks that are critical in determining cell stiffness . 1 - 6 The network mechanics are determined by the properties of the biopolymers , as well as the interplay between them , 7 , 8 rendering studies of the mechanics of ensembles of networks essential for understanding the cellular interior . An ideal system for such studies is the in vitro network , as it provides a well - controlled environment . Previous in vitro studies have reported the mechanics of either single ﬁlaments , 9 - 12 or networks of ﬁlaments comprised of single biopolymer spe - cies . 13 - 18 Studies on composite polymer networks have used either artiﬁcial interpenetrating polymers , 19 or a mixture of stiff and semiﬂexible biopolymer ﬁlaments . 20 , 21 However , the cell contains a combination of 2 different semiﬂexible polymers , F ‑ actin and IF , that together comprise a majority of the intracel - lular network . 22 Since the ﬁnal structural state of biopolymer net - works is greatly affected by changes in assembly kinetics and steric constraints , 23 - 25 the presence of an IF network is likely to alter the assembly of F ‑ actin networks . Thus , determining the impact of IF on F ‑ actin network formation will provide a funda - mental basis for understanding the emergent behavior of com - posite semiﬂexible networks in cells . Here , we study the mechanics of a composite network comprised of the 2 different semiﬂexible biopolymers found in mesenchymal cells , F - actin and vimentin IF . 26 We generate a crosslinked F ‑ actin network interpenetrated with a vimentin IF network and use bulk rheology to investigate the composite network mechanics in both the linear and nonlinear regimes . We ﬁnd that co ‑ polymerization with vimentin strengthens F ‑ actin networks when actin crosslinkers are abundant , as expected from the overall increase in the amount of polymer in the network . Surprisingly , F ‑ actin networks are weak - ened by co ‑ polymerization with vimentin when the F ‑ actin cross - linking density is low compared to the network mesh size . Based on changes in network elasticity , yield stress , and strain stiffening , we show that this counterintuitive result arises from steric constraints on F ‑ actin by vimentin IF , leading to a lower degree of F ‑ actin cross - linking in the ﬁnal network . Results Co ‑ polymerization of vimentin with actin can either weaken or strength F ‑ actin networks Under strain , all composite F ‑ actin ‑ vimentin IF networks exam - ined in this work ﬁrst exhibit a linear elastic regime , with the initial slope of the stress ‑ strain curve providing a measure for the elastic modulus G 0 . Strain stiffening occurs at a critical strain g crit , evident as an increase in elasticity quantiﬁed by the nonlinear tangent mod - ulus K 0 D @ s = @ g . The networks fail at a maximal stress s max , after which the stress decreases with strain , as shown in Figure 1 .

At 18 m M actin , co ‑ polymeriza - tion with vimentin slightly lowers the yield stress and network elas - ticity , as shown in Figure 1A . In contrast , at 6 m M actin , co ‑ polymerization with vimentin increases both yield stress and elasticity , as shown in Figure 1B . To quantify the differences between F ‑ actin networks and com - posite F ‑ actin ‑ vimentin IF networks , we calculate the absolute change in the linear elastic modulus , D G 0 , and the fractional changes in the maximal tangent modulus K 0 max and yield stress s max , each of which is extracted from the slope and the peak of the stress ‑ strain curves shown in Figure 1 . At 6 m M actin , co ‑ polymeri - zation with vimentin results in an increase of the network yield stress s max . However , this increase becomes gradually less pro - nounced with increasing actin concentration , and at 18 m M actin a decrease in s max is observed , as shown in Figure 2A . At low con - centrations of actin , co ‑ polymerization with vimentin increases the linear elastic modulus G 0 , as shown in Figure 2B . This increase cor - responds closely to the modulus of the single ‑ species vimentin IF network ( black curve , Fig . 2B ) , suggesting that vimentin IF adds linearly to the elasticity of the F ‑ actin network at low actin concen - trations . However , with higher actin concentrations , co ‑ polymeriza - tion with vimentin leads to a smaller increase or even a slight decrease in G 0 . The nonlinear elasticity shows a similar trend , as co ‑ polymerization with vimentin increases the maximal tangent modulus K 0 max at lower actin concentrations , but decreases it at higher actin concentrations , as shown in Figure 2C . Vimentin strengthening or weakening of F ‑ actin networks is dependent on F ‑ actin crosslinker density We conduct rheology on 15 m M F ‑ actin networks co ‑ poly - merized with vimentin while varying the density of biotinylated actin monomers , thereby controlling the average distance between sites of F ‑ actin crosslinking . We quantify the elasticity and yield stress of the networks , as well as the critical strain at which the networks undergo strain stiffening . When sites of F ‑ actin crosslinking are closely spaced , corresponding to a high density of biotinylated actin monomers in the F ‑ actin ﬁlaments , co ‑ polymerization with 3 m M vimentin results in an increase in both linear modulus and yield stress , and a lower critical strain . Conversely , when biotinylated actin monomers are sparse and crosslinking sites farther apart , co ‑ polymerization with 3 m M vimentin decreases the yield stress and linear modulus , and delays the onset of strain stiffening , as shown in Figure 3 . Discussion Our data show that co ‑ polymerization of vimentin and actin can result in composite networks that are either stronger or weaker than pure F ‑ actin networks , depending on the concentra - tion of actin and the density of F ‑ actin crosslinkers . These com - posite networks consist of interpenetrating F - actin and vimentin IF networks of comparable mesh sizes , as shown in Figure 4 . We estimate the mesh size j of the F ‑ actin network at these concen - trations to range from 0 . 26 m m to 0 . 45 m m , based on the depen - dence on monomer concentration j » c ¡ 1 = 2 and the protein volume fraction . 27 As there are 370 actin monomers per m m of F - actin , 28 a 1 : 100 biotinylation ratio results in an average spacing between biotinylated sites of j » 0 : 27 m m , roughly comparable to the F ‑ actin network mesh size . Vimentin forms an IF network Figure 1 . Stress ‑ strain curves of composite F ‑ actin ‑ vimentin IF networks with a ratio of 1 : 100 biotinylated actin to plain actin . Samples exhibit an initial elasticity G 0 D D s = D g before undergoing strain stiffening at a criti - cal strain g crit , evident as an increase in the tangent modulus K 0 D @ s = @ g ( the slope of the stress ‑ strain curve ) . The peak of the curve indicates the yield stress s max , the maximal stress the network can withstand before failing . ( A ) At actin concentrations of 18 m M , the maximal stress is decreased as the vimentin concentration is increased from 0 m M ( light gray ) through 0 . 3 m M and 1 . 5 m M to 3 m M ( black ) . ( B ) In contrast , the addition of vimentin , from 0 m M through 0 . 3 m M and 1 . 5 m M to 3 m M , increases the yield stress of the composite network at actin concentra - tions of 6 m M . www . landesbioscience . com 139 BioArchitecture D o w n l o a d e d by [ 65 . 112 . 10 . 230 ] a t 09 : 50 16 M a r c h 2015 with a mesh size ranging from 0 . 80 m m to 2 . 5 m m , assuming a similar protein mass density of actin and vimentin . 29 Despite the qualitative similarities between F ‑ actin - vimentin IF networks and vimentin ‑ free F ‑ actin networks seen in Figure 1 , vimentin IF affects both the linear and nonlinear behavior of the composite networks . To highlight the effect of vimentin IF on the F ‑ actin networks , we quantify these changes as the difference in elasticity and yield stress in networks with and without vimen - tin IF . At low actin concentrations , the composite network is stronger and stiffer with the addition of vimentin IF , consistent with the overall increase in polymer concentration . These com - posite networks exhibit a relative increase in yield stress s max , an increase in the linear elasticity G 0 , and an increase in the maximal nonlinear elasticity K 0 max , as shown in Figure 2 . This increase in linear elasticity is equal to the sum of the elasticity of the individ - ual networks . Surprisingly , at higher actin concentrations , vimen - tin IF results in a reduction of s max and K 0 max , and a linear elasticity G 0 that is lower than the sum of the parts . F ‑ actin net - works co - polymerized with vimentin thus exhibit 2 mechanical regimes : at low actin concentrations , vimentin IF strengthens the composite network and increases its elasticity , while at high actin concentrations , the additional polymer results in an unexpectedly weaker composite network with a lower elasticity and yield stress . Strikingly , the crossover between the strengthening and weak - ening regimes observed in the composite network rheology occurs when the estimated F ‑ actin network mesh size is compara - ble to the distance between F ‑ actin crosslinking sites . To under - stand the transition between these 2 regimes , we consider the degree of crosslinking in the system , since the rheological proper - ties of a crosslinked network are highly dependent on both poly - mer concentration and crosslinker density . 27 In order to become crosslinked , actin ﬁlaments undergo thermal ﬂuctuations to ﬁnd a crosslinking partner . When crosslinks between actin ﬁlaments are formed , the amplitudes of ﬁlament ﬂuctuations are reduced , impeding the formation of additional crosslinks . The degree of crosslinking in the ﬁnal network is thus dependent on the density of crosslinkers , as well as the volume each ﬁlament can thermally explore , resulting in some unutilized crosslinking sites in this ﬁnal state . In our networks , we estimate F ‑ actin crosslinking sites to be nearly fully utilized when the volume a biotinylation site can explore through thermal ﬂuctuations contains at most one other biotinylated site .

( A ) Fractional change in yield stress s max as a function of actin and vimentin concentrations . Increasing the actin concentration gradually reduces the increase in yield stress and transitions to a reduction in yield stress at suf ﬁ ciently high actin concentrations . ( B ) Absolute change in linear elastic modulus G 0 of F - actin - vimentin IF composite networks compared to vimentin ‑ free networks . At low actin concentrations , vimentin IF adds roughly linearly to G 0 . At higher actin concentrations , vimentin IF contributes less to the elasticity , and can even result in a decrease of composite network elasticity . ( C ) Frac - tional change in the maximal nonlinear elasticity K 0 max exhibited by the composite networks under strain . At low actin concentrations , vimentin IF adds to the nonlinear elasticity of the networks , while the nonlinear elasticity is reduced with vimentin IF at high actin concentrations . All values are measured relative to vimentin ‑ free F ‑ actin networks at a given actin concentration . Figure 3 . Vimentin strengthening or weakening of F - actin networks is dependent on the density of F ‑ actin crosslinkers . In a 15 m M F ‑ actin net - work , at high crosslinking densities ( small average distance between crosslinkers ) , co ‑ polymerization with 3 m M vimentin increases the maxi - mal composite network stress and linear elastic modulus , while lowering the critical strain of composite network strain stiffening . The opposite trend is seen at lower crosslinking densities ( larger average distance between crosslinkers ) , as 3 m M vimentin delays the onset of strain stiff - ening , but decreases the linear elastic modulus and maximal composite network stress . All fractional changes are measured relative to a vimen - tin ‑ free 15 m M F - actin network . 140 Volume 4 Issue 4 - 5 BioArchitecture D o w n l o a d e d by [ 65 . 112 . 10 . 230 ] a t 09 : 50 16 M a r c h 2015 length l undergoes transverse motion with a root ‑ mean ‑ square amplitude of u rms » ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ l 3 = l p q , where l p denotes the ﬁlament persistence length . 30 In a network , however , the surrounding ﬁla - ments limit these ﬂuctuations . Thus , the magnitude of these ther - mal transverse ﬂuctuations in our networks are limited by the F ‑ actin network mesh size j actin , resulting in near ‑ full utilization of crosslinking sites when l c » ξ actin . Remarkably , the predicted mesh size at which crosslinkers are fully utilized coincides with the observed transition between the strengthening and weakening regimes , suggesting that co ‑ polymerization with vimentin IF weakens F ‑ actin networks when actin crosslinking sites are sparse . Since vimentin IF causes a reduction in yield stress and network elasticity when l c (cid:2) ξ actin , we hypothesize that the additional ste - ric constraint imposed by vimentin IF results in a loss of F ‑ actin crosslinking in this case . If vimentin IF indeed weakens F ‑ actin networks through a dis - ruption of actin crosslinking when crosslinkers are sparse , we expect to recover the network strengthening regime by increasing the F ‑ actin crosslinking density . We therefore conduct rheology experiments at a ﬁxed actin concentration of 15 m M while vary - ing the actin biotinylation ratio . As before , both G 0 and s max are reduced with the addition of vimentin IF when crosslinking sites are far apart , corresponding to a low ratio of biotinylated to plain actin . In contrast , by increasing the number of crosslinking sites , we are able to recover a relative increase in both G 0 and s max , as depicted in Figure 3 , suggesting that vimentin IF disrupts F ‑ actin crosslinking when crosslinkers are sparse . This is further veriﬁed by investigating the onset of strain stiffening g crit , which in sin - gle ‑ species semiﬂexible polymer networks is expected to scale as g crit » l c = l p , and therefore provides a measure of changes in crosslinking in the network . 15 , 31 When F ‑ actin crosslinking sites are abundant , we observe a shift toward earlier strain stiffening , as shown in Figure 3 , suggesting that the effective crosslinking of the composite network is higher than for the plain F - actin net - work . We attribute this to the interpenetration of the 2 networks , effectively increasing the sites of interaction between ﬁlaments in the composite network . In contrast , the strain stiffening onset is delayed by the co ‑ polymerization with vimentin IF when the average distance between biotinylated sites in F ‑ actin is large , pointing to a loss of F ‑ actin crosslinking in the network . Notably , the transition between these 2 regimes coincides with the observed crossover in G 0 and s max . As predicted , all 3 rheological changes are attributable to the same underlying reduction in F ‑ actin crosslinking , conﬁrming our hypothesis that the presence of vimentin IF can reduce the volume explored by actin ﬁlaments during network formation , as indicated by the shaded regions in Figure 5 . When F ‑ actin crosslinkers are abundant , the reduction in actin ﬁlament ﬂuctuations due to the presence of vimentin IF will not reduce the overall crosslinking , as alternate crosslinking sites are available , as shown schematically in Figure 5A and B . At low crosslinking densities , this same reduction in ﬂuctuations can lead to a loss of all neighboring crosslinking sites , as illustrated in Figure 5C and D . As a result of this reduction in actin ﬁlament ﬂuctuations , the addition of vimentin IF can lead to either a strengthening of the composite network through the additional polymer present , or a weakening through the disruption of physi - cal F ‑ actin crosslinking sites . This emergent behavior highlights the importance of considering biopolymers in composite net - works when seeking to understand the material properties of complex networks such as the cytoskeleton . Previous microrheological studies of a composite network of rigid and semiﬂexible biopolymer found rheological properties between those of the single ‑ species networks , 20 while bulk rheological studies showed that microtubules in crosslinked F ‑ actin networks induced actin strain stiffening . 21 Here , we observe a new phenomenon in composite semiﬂexible networks , in which the composite network is either strengthened or weakened by the addition of a second semi - ﬂexible polymer species , depending on the concentrations and den - sity of crosslinkers . In cells , the exact behavior of composite cytoskeletal networks will depend on the nature of the crosslinkers that mediate their interconnections and molecular crosstalk . For example , many F ‑ actin crosslinkers form F ‑ actin bundles and are dynamically binding and unbinding to and from F - actin , 32 , 33 cyto - linker proteins form crossbridges between IF and F ‑ actin , 34 and molecular motors can form connections between microtubules and IF . 35 , 36 Further studies using biological crosslinkers will help to bet - ter understand more complex biopolymer networks , but the studies Figure 4 .

The result is an interpenetrating network of the 2 species of biopolymers . At a 1 : 100 actin biotinylation ratio , the average distance between actin crosslinking sites is comparable to the actin network mesh size . www . landesbioscience . com 141 BioArchitecture D o w n l o a d e d by [ 65 . 112 . 10 . 230 ] a t 09 : 50 16 M a r c h 2015 presented here provide a necessary founda - tion for understanding the interplay between semiﬂexible polymers in compos - ite networks . Methods and Materials Proteins Actin is puriﬁed from rabbit skeletal muscle 37 and stored as G ‑ actin in G ‑ buffer ( 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 005 % NaN 3 , and 2 mM Tris ‑ HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) at - 80 (cid:2) C until the day before the experiment . Biotinylated G ‑ actin is purchased from Cytoskeleton ( Denver , CO ) as a lyophi - lized powder and resuspended in G ‑ buffer one day prior to experiments . Neutravidin is from Sigma ( St . Louis , MO ) . Vimentin is expressed in and puriﬁed from Escherichia coli 38 and stored in a dialysis buffer of 5 mM Tris - HCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 mM EGTA , and 1 mM DTT , pH 8 . 4 at - 80 (cid:2) C until the day of the experiment . Composite networks Composite networks are formed using 6 ‑ 18 m M F ‑ actin with a 1 : 100 molar ratio of biotinylated actin to plain actin . Actin is co ‑ polymerized with 0 . 3 ‑ 3 m M vimentin crosslinked with magnesium . 18 Networks are formed by ﬁrst pre ‑ polyme - rizing plain G ‑ actin together with bioti - nylated actin monomers for 60 seconds at room temperature . 39 This is done to ensure an even incorporation of the bioti - nylated actin monomers into the actin ﬁl - aments . F ‑ actin crosslinking is then initiated by the addition of a 2 ‑ fold molar excess of neutravidin together with unpo - lymerized vimentin in dialysis buffer , after which the network is mixed and loaded immediately onto a rheometer for mechanics measurements . The ﬁnal buffer conditions of 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 100 mM KCl , 0 . 5 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM DTT , and 2 mM Tris ‑ HCl allow for the crosslinking of F ‑ actin in the presence of faster ‑ forming vimentin IF network , 40 while the use of a biotin - neutravidin F ‑ ac - tin crosslinker allows for a ﬁnal network structure that depends only on the network formation kinetics . Bulk rheology The network mechanics are characterized at 25 (cid:2) C on an Ares G2 stress controlled shear rheometer ( TA Instruments , New Castle , DE ) using a stainless steel parallel plate geome - try with a 40 - mm - diameter top plate , to which actin and vimentin attach nonspeciﬁcally . 14 , 39 90 minutes after loading , during which the proteins polymerize and form a network , the sample is subjected to a strain ramp at a rate of 0 . 25 % / s , during which the stress s and the strain g are measured . The elasticity is quantiﬁed as the initial linear elastic modulus G 0 D D s = D g and the nonlinear tangent modulus K 0 D @ s = @ g ( the slope of the stress ‑ strain curve ) . We also quantify the onset of strain stiffening g crit , and the yield stress s max as the maximal Figure 5 . Vimentin IF restricts F - actin ﬂ uctuations , which leads to a loss of F ‑ actin crosslinking when F ‑ actin crosslinkers are scarce . Shaded areas indicate the volume explored by an actin ﬁ lament through thermal ﬂ uctuations before these are reduced by crosslinking . ( A ) When F ‑ actin crosslinkers are abundant , several biotins are within reach of a given biotin ‑ neutravidin site , indicated by stars , and any of these can bind to crosslink the 2 actin ﬁ laments . ( B ) Co ‑ polymerization with vimentin to form IF constrains actin ﬁ lament ﬂ uctuations , but biotin sites are still within reach at high biotin densi - ties , and an F ‑ actin crosslink can form . ( C ) At low biotin densities , reachable crosslinking partners are fewer and farther apart . ( D ) Steric constraints by vimentin IF can now result in a loss of F ‑ actin cross - linking , weakening the resulting composite network . 142 Volume 4 Issue 4 - 5 BioArchitecture D o w n l o a d e d by [ 65 . 112 . 10 . 230 ] a t 09 : 50 16 M a r c h 2015 stress the networks can withstand before failing , as previously described . 39 Disclosure of Potential Conﬂicts of Interest No potential conﬂicts of interest were disclosed .
