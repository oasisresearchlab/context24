Drawing on a ﬁeld survey of 735 Chinese undergraduates at 26 universities , this study provides evidence for the argument that entrepreneurial alertness has a fully mediation effect on the relationship between creativity , a proactive personality , and entrepreneurial intention . The ﬁndings shed light on the mechanisms that underpin entrepreneurial alertness and contribute to the literature on key elements of the entrepreneurial process . Keywords : creativity , proactive personality , entrepreneurial alertness , entrepreneurial intention , mediation effect INTRODUCTION Given rising unemployment rates and the richer opportunities oﬀered by rapid globalization and marketization , more and more college students are opting to start their own businesses . A large body of empirical studies has tried to ascertain the extent to which entrepreneurship contributes to economic growth by creating new jobs and encouraging innovation . Given that researchers have highlighted the importance of intentions as antecedents of behavior in recent years ( Shook et al . , 2003 ) , investigating the factors that inﬂuence individual intention to pursue entrepreneurship could accelerate the development of the entrepreneurial process . Such research could shape individual entrepreneurial intention , providing crucial support for both theory and practice . Although the relationship between diﬀerent factors and entrepreneurial intention has been widely studied , the decision processes that facilitate individual entrepreneurial behavior remain an open issue ( Markman et al . , 2002 ; Zampetakis , 2008 ) . Scholars have debated the vital role played by entrepreneurial alertness in the entrepreneurial process . “The value of examining entrepreneurial alertness is that it concerns the individual’s awareness , assessment , and orientation toward uncertainties and changes in the external environment and context—beyond the within - person , internal issue of identity” ( Uy et al . , 2015 ) . The inﬂuences of proactive personality and creativity on entrepreneurial desirable and intention have also been widely studied ( Crant , 1996 ; Zampetakis , 2008 ) . Hansen et al . ( 2011 ) have argued that creativity and proactive personality are the main factors inﬂuencing entrepreneurial intention because they are closely linked with identifying opportunities ; they serve an important function in encouraging new enterprises . However , to the best of our knowledge , the relationships between entrepreneurial alertness , creativity , proactive personality , and entrepreneurial intentions are still under - explored ; few studies have tested the indirect eﬀect of creativity or proactive personality on entrepreneurial intention outside Western culture . It is therefore important to connect entrepreneurial alertness and proactive personality with entrepreneurial intention to provide new Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 1 June 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 951 fpsyg - 09 - 00951 June 12 , 2018 Time : 17 : 17 # 2 Hu et al . Creativity , Proactive Personality , and Entrepreneurial Intention theoretical and practical insights . To tackle this timely issue , we have used a university student sample from the Chinese mainland to examine whether , and the extent to which , creativity and proactive personality are associated with entrepreneurial alertness and intention . The paper is structured as follows . Section “Literature Review and Hypothesis Development” brieﬂy reviews previous studies that touch on the relationship between proactive personality , creativity , and entrepreneurial intention . Section “Aims and Hypotheses” introduces our hypotheses . The methodology and data are presented in section “Materials and Methods . ” Section “Results” reveals the relationships among the targeted variables . The paper concludes with a discussion of the contributions and limitations of this study ( see section “Discussion and Conclusion” ) . LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT Entrepreneurial Alertness One of the most signiﬁcant topics in the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship is the awareness of entrepreneurial opportunities , previously addressed by Campos ( 2016 ) . Israel Kirzner’s theory of entrepreneurial alertness has added value to the research on opportunity identiﬁcation . Kirzner ( 1973 ) was the ﬁrst to deﬁne the role played by entrepreneurial alertness in helping entrepreneurs become more aware of new opportunities and use limited clues in diﬀerent ways . In further research , Kirzner ( 1979 ) has deﬁned entrepreneurial alertness as an individual’s ability to perceive new opportunities that have hitherto been overlooked by others ; more speciﬁcally , alertness can be described as : “a motivated propensity of man to formulate an image of the future” ( Kirzner , 1985 ) . In accordance with Kirzner’s research , Baron and Ensley ( 2006 ) have argued that alert individuals “identify new solutions to market and customer needs in existing information , and to imagine new products and services that do not currently exist” ( Baron and Ensley , 2006 ) . A central study by McMullen and Shepherd ( 2006 ) has conﬁrmed that , “To act on the possibility that one has identiﬁed an opportunity worth pursuing” is the heart of being an entrepreneur ( McMullen and Shepherd , 2006 ) . Gaglio and Katz ( 2001 ) have asserted that a high level of entrepreneurial alertness leads to acute sensitivity to one’s surroundings , a mental framework that helps entrepreneurs adjust to the current situation . Based on previous research , Tang et al . ( 2012 ) have produced a 13 - item model , which theoretically and empirically divides entrepreneurial alertness into three distinct factors : ( a ) “scanning and search , ” ( b ) “association and connection , ” and ( c ) “evaluation and judgment . ” Tang’s instrument is well - validated and has strong reliability , providing researchers with a valuable tool for probing the entire entrepreneurial opportunity - development process , including antecedents and outcomes . In the Chinese context , Li et al . ( 2015 ) and Hu and Ye ( 2017 ) have studied Chinese university students , concluding that entrepreneurial alertness directly and signiﬁcantly predicts opportunity recognition . The goal of alertness research is to discover not only the antecedents of alertness , but also its outcomes ( Kirzner , 2009 ) . The present study aims to reveal whether , and the extent to which , entrepreneurial alertness mediates the eﬀects of creativity and a proactive personality on entrepreneurial intention . Creativity , Proactive Personality , and Entrepreneurial Alertness Creativity signiﬁcantly inﬂuences an individual’s entrepreneurial alertness . Creativity , which refers to the development of novel and useful ideas , is closely related to innovation and generally studied at the individual level ( Amabile , 1996 ; Zampetakis , 2008 ) . Furthermore , the interaction between an individual and his or her environment will yield creativity ( Hunter et al . , 2007 ) . Factors such as an individual’s intrinsic motivation , personality , knowledge , cognitive style , and social background can play important roles in the cultivation of creativity ( Woodman and Schoenfeldt , 1990 ; Sternberg and Lubart , 1995 ; Amabile , 1996 ) . Creativity has become a central theme in entrepreneurial process research . The relationship between creativity and enterprise has been conﬁrmed by researchers : novel ideas are produced when access to information is clear and free ( Biraglia and Kadile , 2017 ) ; such new ideas exemplify the nature of creativity and lead to new entrepreneurial ventures ( McMullan and Kenworthy , 2015 ) . Creativity is a key element at the start of the entrepreneurial process , since it contributes to the design of new products and services ( Heinonen et al . , 2011 ; Gielnik et al . , 2012 ) . Feldman and Bolino ( 2000 ) have argued that individuals with higher perceived creativity are more likely to build up their own businesses ; this conﬁrms the ﬁndings of Sternberg and Lubart ( 1999 ) , who have noted that entrepreneurship is , to some extent , the result of creativity . Given the importance of identifying entrepreneurial opportunities in the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship , experts maintain that alertness about opportunities is important , not only for innovation behavior ( Obschonka et al . , 2017 ) , but also for successful entrepreneurial behavior ( Baron , 2006 ) . Kirzner ( 2009 ) believes that entrepreneurial alertness involves creative behavior . This , to some extent , conﬁrms the conclusion drawn by Ardichvili et al . ( 2003 ) that a conceptual link exists between creativity and entrepreneurial alertness . Empirical studies have conﬁrmed that creative activities involving the use of new communication and Internet technologies may also predict entrepreneurial alertness . Campos ( 2016 ) and Obschonka et al . ( 2017 ) have empirically conﬁrmed that creativity has a signiﬁcant relationship with entrepreneurial alertness , particularly in the dimensions of scanning and searching . Campos ( 2016 ) has used a moderated mediation model to identify a positive correlation between creativity and entrepreneurial alertness . Alertness requires a creative act , which may inﬂuence the further development and improvement of entrepreneurial opportunities ( Baron , 2004 ; Kirzner , 2009 ) . Thus , creativity is associated with entrepreneurial alertness . The proactive personality is also associated with entrepreneurial alertness . “Proactivity refers to active attempts made by the individual to eﬀect changes in his or her Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 2 June 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 951 fpsyg - 09 - 00951 June 12 , 2018 Time : 17 : 17 # 3 Hu et al . Creativity , Proactive Personality , and Entrepreneurial Intention environment” ( Zampetakis , 2008 ) . According to Bateman and Crant ( 1993 ) , people with proactive personalities tend to take the initiative to inﬂuence and even to signiﬁcantly change the environment . In other words , having a proactive personality can help an individual release situational pressures , identify opportunities for advantage , make proactive moves , and thereby inﬂuence the environment to create meaningful changes ( Bateman and Crant , 1993 ) . Alongside previous research on environmental adaptability ( Crant , 1995 , 2000 ) and proactivity , additional empirical studies have conﬁrmed that proactive individuals are more likely to achieve success at work and more positively attuned to the need for dominance , achievement , self - conﬁdence , and conscientiousness ( Claes et al . , 2005 ) . Previous studies have identiﬁed a positive relationship between proactive personality and entrepreneurship ( e . g . , Becherer and Maurer , 1999 ; Kickul and Zaper , 2000 ) . For instance , Becherer and Maurer ( 1999 ) have related proactivity to starting rather than buying or inheriting a business , as well as to the number of businesses started . Proactive personality is seen as the crucial antecedent of entrepreneurial alertness to opportunities because opportunity identiﬁcation is an important aspect of individual initiative ( Ardichvili et al . , 2003 ; Tang et al . , 2012 ) . Using a survey that researched a diverse group of undergraduate students from Singapore , Uy et al . ( 2015 ) have shown that entrepreneurial alertness partially mediates the relationship between a proactive personality and a boundless career mindset , and conﬁrming that personality traits , such as proactive personality , are connected to entrepreneurial alertness . Obschonka et al . ( 2017 ) , using two - wave longitudinal data from high schools in Helsinki , Finland , has conﬁrmed that entrepreneurial alertness is predicted by diﬀerent underlying competencies ; furthermore , both creativity and proactivity improve the link between personality and entrepreneurial alertness . Entrepreneurial Alertness and Entrepreneurial Intention Entrepreneurial alertness is closely associated with individual entrepreneurial intention . Entrepreneurial intention is “a self - acknowledged conviction by a person that they intend to set up a new business venture and consciously plan to do so at some point in the future” ( Thompson , 2009 ) . It constitutes a more or less concrete plan to prepare for , and then ultimately start , an entrepreneurial career of one’s own in the future ( Obschonka et al . , 2017 ) . Entrepreneurial intention plays a crucial role in shaping an individual’s entrepreneurial behaviors ( Markman et al . , 2002 ) , “the stronger a person’s intention to engage in a speciﬁc behavior , the more likely it is that the actual behavior will be performed” ( Ajzen , 1991 ) . The connection between entrepreneurial alertness and entrepreneurial intention has been empirically conﬁrmed by McMullen and Shepherd ( 2006 ) , who have argued that entrepreneurial alertness improves the judgment and opportunity identiﬁcation of individuals , helping to form entrepreneurial intention and future business behavior . In a Chinese context , Li et al . ( 2015 ) have conﬁrmed that entrepreneurial alertness is an essential strength for entrepreneurs because it directly predicts opportunity recognition . Guided by social cognitive theory , Hu and Ye ( 2017 ) , using a sample of 364 Chinese students majoring in sports , have conﬁrmed that both entrepreneurial alertness and entrepreneurial self - eﬃcacy are key cognitive predictors of entrepreneurial intention . Having reviewed the existing literature , we therefore raise our hypotheses in section “Aims and Hypotheses . ” AIMS AND HYPOTHESES As discussed in the Sections “Introduction” and “Literature Review and Hypothesis Development , ” the relationships between entrepreneurial alertness , creativity , proactive personality , and entrepreneurial intentions remain under - explored . Therefore , this study had the objective to ﬁll the gap in the literature in two ways . First , resorting to a nationally representative survey of entrepreneurship of Chinese college students , this study aims to investigate the relationships among creativity , proactive personality , entrepreneurial alertness and entrepreneurial intention in the Asian culture . Second , the current study mainly focuses on how the entrepreneurial alertness mediates the eﬀects of students’ proactive personalities and creativity on entrepreneurial intention . This mediation eﬀect of entrepreneurial alertness had not yet been investigated in the context of this theory . Accordingly , this study raises the following hypotheses : ( 1 ) There is a positive relationship between creativity and entrepreneurial alertness ( Hypothesis 1 ) . ( 2 ) There is a positive relationship between proactive personality and entrepreneurial alertness ( Hypothesis 2 ) . ( 3 ) There is a positive relationship between entrepreneurial alertness and entrepreneurial intention ( Hypothesis 3 ) . ( 4 ) Cumulatively , the predictions above suggest the role and relevance of mediation : creativity inﬂuences students’ entrepreneurial alertness , which in turn positively aﬀects entrepreneurial intention ( Hypothesis 4a ) . Similarly , a proactive personality inﬂuences students’ entrepreneurial alertness , which in turn positively aﬀects entrepreneurial intention ( Hypothesis 4b ) . To examine the four hypotheses , the current study extends from the previous wisdom and designs the model with the mediator . The operationalization of the mediating model in current study is described in Figure 1 . MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants The sample was drawn from a nationally representative survey . A total of 857 undergraduate students from 26 universities volunteered to participate in this survey . Of the initial dataset , 122 respondents were eliminated due to incomplete or questionable response patterns ( e . g . , selecting “5” as a response across an entire Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 3 June 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 951 fpsyg - 09 - 00951 June 12 , 2018 Time : 17 : 17 # 4 Hu et al . Creativity , Proactive Personality , and Entrepreneurial Intention FIGURE 1 | The proposed structural relationships between creativity , proactive personality , entrepreneurial alertness , and entrepreneurial intention . section of the survey , which included reverse - worded items ) ; this study ultimately produced 735 valid samples . To keep the sample unbiased , the survey selected respondents studying a wide range of ﬁelds : a fair distribution across 19 areas of specialization guaranteed a representative sample of students , enabling us to analyze the entrepreneurial intentions of college students in studying ﬁelds . The participants were majoring in Agricultural Science ( 6 % ) , Animal Science ( 7 % ) , Aquaculture ( 7 % ) , Biological Sciences ( 7 % ) , Business Administration ( 5 % ) , Chemistry ( 5 % ) , Computing Science ( 4 % ) , Economics ( 5 % ) , Environmental Science ( 7 % ) , Food Science ( 5 % ) , Horticulture ( 7 % ) , Law ( 5 % ) , Marketing Management ( 4 % ) , Mechanics ( 5 % ) , Public Administration ( 4 % ) , Sociology ( 5 % ) , and Tea Study ( 5 % ) . The participants were aged 18 – 22 with a mean of 20 . 02 years ( SD = 3 . 11 ) . Of the total sample , 59 . 6 % ( n = 438 ) were males and 40 . 4 % ( n = 297 ) were females , with mean ages of 20 . 77 years ( SD = 5 . 75 ) and 19 . 76 years ( SD = 1 . 60 ) , respectively . The distribution by academic year was as follows : 48 . 2 % were 1 st year college students ( n = 354 ) ; 33 . 3 % were 2 nd year college students ( n = 245 ) ; 6 . 8 % were 3 rd year college students ( n = 50 ) ; 7 . 6 % were 4 th year college students ( n = 56 ) ; 3 . 5 % were 1 st year graduate students ( n = 26 ) ; and 0 . 5 % were 2 nd year graduate students ( n = 4 ) . Instruments All of the independent and dependent variables were evaluated using self - report measures based on multi - item scales . Responses across all dimensions and items were made using ﬁve - point Likert - type scales , ranging from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 5 ( strongly agree ) . All of the items were translated into Mandarin by a native speaker ; they were re - translated into English by other bilingual individuals to guarantee that the scales had similar quality and connotations . The instruments and some items in the constructs are outlined below . Proactive Personality The proactive personality scale used in this study was the six - item scale adopted by Bateman and Crant ( 1993 ) . The original scales were those of Claes et al . ( 2005 ) . The proactive personality scale included items such as , “Regardless of the odds , if I believe in something , I will make it happen . ” The Cronbach’s alpha was 0 . 845 . All of the items accounted for 78 . 08 % of the variance . Creativity Creativity was measured using an eight - item scale developed by Zhou and George ( 2001 ) . The items referred to the production of useful and creative ideas ( Zampetakis , 2008 ) . Examples included the following : “I develop adequate plans and schedules for the implementation of new ideas” and “I suggest new ways to increase the quality of project assignments . ” The Cronbach’s alpha for all eight items was 0 . 919 . All of the items accounted for 64 . 02 % of the variance . Entrepreneurial Alertness Entrepreneurial alertness was tested using Tang et al . ’s ( 2012 ) scale , which categorizes 13 items into three factors : scanning and search , association and connection , and evaluation and judgment . Examples included the following : “I have frequent interactions with others to acquire new information” ( scanning and search ) , “I often see connections between previously unconnected domains of information” ( association and connection ) , and “When facing multiple opportunities , I am able to select the good ones” ( evaluation and judgment ) . The alpha coeﬃcient of the general alertness factor was 0 . 879 . All of the items accounted for 64 . 15 % of the variance with each of the three factors accounting for 45 . 89 , 11 . 14 , and 7 . 11 % , respectively . The mean for entrepreneurial alertness was 3 . 48 ( SD = 0 . 6 ) . Entrepreneurial Intention We assessed entrepreneurial intention using scales developed by Krueger et al . ( 2000 ) . Although Krueger et al . ’s ( 2000 ) scale included nine factors , this study dropped three factors and used a six - item scale to suit the Chinese context . For example , “I intend to start my own business in the near future . ” The alpha coeﬃcient of the entrepreneurial intention scale was 0 . 915 . All of the items explained 70 . 39 % of the variance . The mean of entrepreneurial intentions was 2 . 74 ( SD = 0 . 78 ) . Control Variables We controlled for the students’ gender , age , and entrepreneurial role models ( whether a parent or relative was an entrepreneur ) . According to Díaz - García and Jiménez - Moreno ( 2010 ) , male Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 4 June 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 951 fpsyg - 09 - 00951 June 12 , 2018 Time : 17 : 17 # 5 Hu et al . Creativity , Proactive Personality , and Entrepreneurial Intention students’ express higher entrepreneurial intention than female students . Demographic factors appear to signiﬁcantly aﬀect entrepreneurial intention ( Hockerts , 2017 ) . Procedure To reduce the sample selection bias , our survey used various classrooms and collected the questionnaires randomly . Informed consent was obtained from all participants . Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire that included 5 sections and 27 questions , covering entrepreneurial intention , entrepreneurial alertness , creativity , and proactive personality , as well as demographic features . The participants were asked whether they agreed or disagreed with each question . This study did not involve any potential risk for the participants . They were also informed that participation was voluntary and anonymous ; the data were protected by applicable legislation . Four members of the research team traveled to the various universities to conduct this survey . Data Analysis The current study analyzed the relationships between each variable , using Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient and SPSS version 22 . We tested the theoretical model in Figure 1 using structural equation modeling ( SEM ) via AMOS 17 . 0 and evaluated model ﬁt using the Chi - square statistic , the Chi - square - to - degrees - of - freedom ratio , the goodness - of - ﬁt index ( GFI ) , the comparative ﬁt index ( CFI ) , the Tucker - Lewis index ( TLI ) , and the root - mean square error of approximation ( RMSEA ) . Researchers have suggested that levels of 0 . 90 or higher for GFI , CFI , and TLI ( the closer to 1 , the better the index ) and levels of 0 . 08 or lower for RMSEA ( the closer to 0 , the better the RMSEA ) indicate that a model ﬁts the data appropriately ( Lance et al . , 2007 ; Kim et al . , 2009 ) . We then tested the research hypotheses by examining whether each structural path was statistically signiﬁcant . In addition , we tested the mediation eﬀects of entrepreneurial alertness on the relationship between creativity and proactive personality and entrepreneurial intention using a Chi - square diﬀerence test ( Anderson and Gerbing , 1988 ; Hui et al . , 1999 ) . Speciﬁcally , we compared the mediated model ( as proposed in Figure 1 ) to a full model that included direct eﬀects . We then tested whether the χ 2 diﬀerence between the two models was signiﬁcant or not . A non - signiﬁcant χ 2 diﬀerence indicates a full mediation eﬀect ( Hui et al . , 1999 ; Kim et al . , 2009 ) . For the mediation test , the following three conditions had to be met : ( 1 ) predictive and mediating variables have signiﬁcant eﬀects on the outcome variable ; ( 2 ) predictive variables have signiﬁcant eﬀects on the mediating variables ; ( 3 ) the eﬀect of predictive variables on the outcome variable tends to weaken when mediating variables are added , while the eﬀect of the mediating variables on the outcome variable remain signiﬁcant ( Wen et al . , 2016 ) . Finally , we used bootstrapping procedures ( re - sampled 1000 times , with the percentile method used to create 95 % conﬁdence intervals ) to further conﬁrm the mediation eﬀects . RESULTS Descriptive Statistics A conﬁrmatory factor analysis ( CFA ) was conducted to assess the discriminant validity of the measures . Our hypothesized four - factor structure was conﬁrmed by the CFA results . The four - factor model had signiﬁcantly lower Chi - square statistics [ χ 2 ( 113 ) = 622 . 185 , p < 0 . 01 ] than a one - factor model with all items loaded on a single construct [ χ 2 ( 122 ) = 2926 . 02 , p < 0 . 01 ] . This is conﬁrmed by the fact that other indices of the four - factor model ( RMSEA = 0 . 078 ; GFI = 0 . 902 ; CFI = 0 . 922 ; TLI = 0 . 906 ) ﬁt better than those of the one - factor model ( RMSEA = 0 . 177 ; GFI = 0 . 596 ; CFI = 0 . 57 ; TLI = 0 . 521 ) . As expected , each item loaded on its hypothesized factor with large and signiﬁcant loadings ; each construct extracted a variance that was larger than the highest variance it shared with any other construct , thus providing support for discriminant validity . Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics , reliability estimates , and correlations for all measures . It can be clearly observed that the reliabilities of all variables are in the reasonable range ( 0 . 79 – 0 . 88 ) . A strong correlation can be observed both between entrepreneurial intention and its antecedents and between these antecedents . The main statistics in Table 1 deliver the following messages : ( 1 ) both creativity and proactive personality are signiﬁcantly related to entrepreneurial alertness and entrepreneurial intention ; ( 2 ) the control variables ( gender and business - owning parent ) are both signiﬁcantly related to entrepreneurial intention . These ﬁndings suggest that students who are more creative , proactive , and alert are more likely to start their own businesses . Assessment of the Structural Model To test the hypotheses , we carried out a structural equation analysis of the relationships between creativity , proactive personality , entrepreneurial alertness , and entrepreneurial intention . In particular , we examined whether creativity and a proactive personality were both positively related to entrepreneurial alertness ( Hypotheses 1 and 2 ) , whether entrepreneurial alertness was signiﬁcantly related to entrepreneurial intention ( Hypothesis 3 ) , and whether or not the eﬀect of entrepreneurial intention was mediated by entrepreneurial alertness ( Hypotheses 4a and 4b ) , as shown in Figure 1 . Model 1 represents the predicted mediating model . We drew paths from creativity and proactive personality to entrepreneurial alertness and from entrepreneurial alertness to entrepreneurial intention . As shown in Table 2 , Model 1 represented a good ﬁt to the data ( RMESA = 0 . 065 , GFI = 0 . 91 , CFI = 0 . 922 , TLI = 0 . 91 ) . We adopted a second model to further test the mediation eﬀect . As shown in Table 2 , Model 2 includes two additional direct paths : from creativity and proactive personality to entrepreneurial intentions . Consistent with Model 1 , the control variables ( gender , age , and parent owns a business ) are included in Model 2 . As shown in Table 2 , the diﬀerence in Chi - square between Model 1 and Model 2 was not signiﬁcant ( (cid:49) χ 2 = 1 . 201 , (cid:49) df = 2 ) . The other indices were almost unaﬀected by including Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 5 June 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 951 fpsyg - 09 - 00951 June 12 , 2018 Time : 17 : 17 # 6 Hu et al .

The insigniﬁcant (cid:49) χ 2 / (cid:49) df also suggests a complete mediation eﬀect of entrepreneurial alertness . According to Kelloway ( 1998 ) , the parsimonious model should be adopted if similar results are obtained from two competing models ; for this reason , Model 1 has been adopted in current study . To better illustrate the mediation eﬀect of entrepreneurial alertness , a bootstrapping regression has been carried out to further demonstrate Model 1 . Table 3 shows the results of the bootstrapping regression , demonstrating that the value of the mediation eﬀect of entrepreneurial alertness is 0 . 232 , between creativity and entrepreneurial intention , in the conﬁdence interval ( 0 . 164 , 0 . 307 ) and 0 . 253 , between proactive personality and entrepreneurial intention , in the conﬁdence interval ( 0 . 187 , 0 . 345 ) . This suggests that entrepreneurial alertness plays a signiﬁcant intermediary role between independent variables ( creativity and proactive personality ) and entrepreneurial intention . We predicted that creativity would be positively associated with entrepreneurial alertness . The signiﬁcant parameter estimate was consistent with this , as shown in Figure 2 ( β = 0 . 46 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Figure 2 also shows that proactive personality was positively and signiﬁcantly related to entrepreneurial alertness ( β = 0 . 50 , p < 0 . 001 ) . In addition , the parameter estimate displayed in Figure 2 indicates that entrepreneurial alertness was positively and signiﬁcantly related to entrepreneurial intention ( β = 0 . 50 , p < 0 . 001 ) . To further test Hypotheses 4a and 4b , Model 3 removed the mediator ( entrepreneurial alertness ) from the initial model . The results of this comparison are shown in Table 4 . In Table 4 , Model 3 shows that creativity has direct and signiﬁcant eﬀects on entrepreneurial intention ( β = 0 . 28 , p < 0 . 001 ) , meanwhile , proactive personality has direct and signiﬁcant eﬀects on entrepreneurial intention ( β = 0 . 20 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Interestingly , these eﬀects become insigniﬁcant when the mediator is taken into the model . The values of β in Model 2 suggest that creativity ( with β = 0 . 01 ) and proactive personality ( with β = − 0 . 12 ) are irrelevant with the entrepreneurial intention if entrepreneurial alertness performs as mediator . DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The current research empirically supported Hypothesis 1 , Hypothesis 2 , and Hypothesis 3 . The estimated path coeﬃcients of our structural equation model conﬁrm the positive eﬀects of creativity and proactive personality on entrepreneurial alertness , and thus support the Hypotheses 1 and 2 . Moreover , Hypothesis 3 is also proved by the positive and signiﬁcant coeﬃcient of entrepreneurial alertness on entrepreneurial intention ( see Figure 2 ) . A further comparison between models with and without mediator suggests that , the eﬀects of the independent variables ( creativity and proactive personality ) on the dependent variable ( entrepreneurial intention ) have been mediated completely by the mediator ( entrepreneurial alertness ) . Hence , Hypotheses 4a and 4b are further conﬁrmed . Although rich , the literature on entrepreneurial intentions has neglected two important items : ( 1 ) the paths from creativity and proactive personality to entrepreneurial alertness and ( 2 ) the Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 6 June 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 951 fpsyg - 09 - 00951 June 12 , 2018 Time : 17 : 17 # 7 Hu et al .

Drawing on a nationally representative survey , this study has ﬁlled this gap in the literature and provided evidence of the combined eﬀects of creativity and proactive personality on entrepreneurial alertness and entrepreneurial intention . This study also suggests that creativity , proactive personality , and entrepreneurial alertness are three key factors in the entrepreneurship process . Most fundamentally , we have found that the proactive personalities and creativity of students are positively related to their entrepreneurial alertness , which in turn inﬂuences entrepreneurial intention . As predicted , our study demonstrated that the eﬀects of creativity and proactive personality on entrepreneurial intention were mediated through entrepreneurial alertness . The mediation model showed that the students who scored higher in creativity and proactive personality tended to have stronger entrepreneurial intention . This can be ascribed to the contribution made by perceived entrepreneurial alertness during the formation of entrepreneurial intention . This study not only reconﬁrms the common view that the alertness to opportunities is a cognitive characteristic , but also conﬁrms that creativity and a proactive personality manifest themselves in personal entrepreneurial intention through mediating processes and mechanisms . In addition , as Zampetakis ( 2008 ) has noted , “to date , however , researchers have not examined the central theoretical role creativity might play in explaining the relationship between proactive behavior and entrepreneurial intentions . ” The current study argues that important role of creativity must not be neglected when we study the eﬀects of cognitive variables on entrepreneurial intentions . This study demonstrates the inﬂuence of creativity and proactive personality on entrepreneurial intentions . It extends the current entrepreneurial alertness literature by addressing their mediating eﬀect on Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 7 June 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 951 fpsyg - 09 - 00951 June 12 , 2018 Time : 17 : 17 # 8 Hu et al . Creativity , Proactive Personality , and Entrepreneurial Intention the relationship between personal traits and entrepreneurial intention . Another important contribution of current study lies in improving the understanding of the importance of entrepreneurial alertness and its related mechanisms . Most alertness studies have focused on identifying the antecedents , rather than the outcomes , of alertness . Since little research has been carried out on the consequences of alertness , the value of present study may relate to the fact that it conﬁrms that entrepreneurial alertness is positively and signiﬁcantly related to entrepreneurial intention . In other words , it is valid to state that there is a direct path from entrepreneurial alertness to entrepreneurial intention ( McMullen and Shepherd , 2006 ) . The present ﬁndings show that entrepreneurial alertness is a vital factor to consider when exploring the way in which personal traits inﬂuence entrepreneurial intentions . It contributes to the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship research by showing that cognitive variables play a crucial role in developing theories related to the entrepreneurial process ( Hermann et al . , 2007 ) . This study is particularly signiﬁcant because it traces the link between personal traits and intention in the context of a non - Western culture . Given that most studies of entrepreneurial alertness and entrepreneurial intention have been carried out in Western countries , in particular , the United States , our ﬁndings are noteworthy in empirically conﬁrming that entrepreneurial alertness is associated with intention in a non - United States culture . These results also show that the college students with higher entrepreneurial alertness tend to exhibit stronger entrepreneurial intentions in mainland China , supporting previous theoretical conclusions in a range of diﬀerent contexts . In eﬀect , it shows that McMullen and Shepherd’s ( 2006 ) results can be replicated in an international context . The present study has some practical implications , as it can help policy makers , university administrators , and teachers to design and implement relevant interventions to enhance students’ entrepreneurial intentions . In particular , this study points to key antecedents of entrepreneurial alertness . As it has been argued that alertness can be developed and cultivated ( Baron , 2004 ) ; this reinforces the idea that entrepreneurship education should focus not only on the technical aspects of entrepreneurship , such as business planning , but also on personal traits ( Heinonen and Poikkijoki , 2006 ; Zampetakis , 2008 ) . As creativity and proactive personality are crucial components of the entrepreneurial process , it is also essential to cultivate creativity and positive personality traits . In China , entrepreneurship education must move beyond traditional examination - oriented teaching styles to focus on promoting positive personal traits , such as a proactive personality and creativity . Given the potential value of creativity and a proactive personality , university training programs could be designed to facilitate cognitive processes involving entrepreneurial alertness ( Solesvik et al . , 2013 ) , to enhance university students’ entrepreneurial orientation , particularly in relation to building their own businesses ( Zampetakis , 2008 ) . The policy interventions need thus to be targeted so as to encourage the college students to start their own business . Limitations Before closing this section , some potential limitations shall be addressed of the analysis . Although a large - scale survey was carried out to guarantee the representativeness of the sample , ﬁeld surveys of this type are highly dependent on self - reported questionnaires . This can lead to common method variance ; as a result , the co - variance between the explanatory variables and the explained variable could not be eliminated . Although the internal consistency of our raters was high , the ratings are subjective . In future , researchers could consider longitudinal studies to further conﬁrm which individuals become successful entrepreneurs and what kinds of cognitive feature signiﬁcantly contribute to their entrepreneurial behavior . Other important variables , such as risk preference and entrepreneurial passion , as well as control variables such as prior entrepreneurial education and experience could be highlighted in studies of entrepreneurial intention .
