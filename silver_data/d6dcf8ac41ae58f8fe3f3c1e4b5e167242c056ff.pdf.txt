Due largely to this role , signaling from Rho GTPases is critical for a wide range of cellular processes , including cell motil - ity , polarization , cell – cell adhesion , cell – matrix adhesion , membrane trafficking and gene expression [ 7 – 9 ] . Conse - quently , Rho GTPases play major roles in various physi - ological processes , including innate and adaptive immunity , neuronal development , vasculogenesis , and angiogenesis ; they have also been implicated in several diseases , including cancer , autism spectrum disorders , metabolic disorders , and vascular disease [ 10 ] , raising the potential for therapeutic interventions [ 11 , 12 ] . Exploration of Rho GTPase signaling over the past ~ 4 decades has revealed extensive signaling pathways and networks by which these proteins exert their actions [ 8 , 9 , 12 – 14 ] . In this review , we discuss the roles and controls of signaling downstream of Rho GTPases via the PAK group , with a particular focus on the type II PAKs : PAK4 , PAK5 and PAK6 .

K . Chetty et al . 1 3 598 Page 2 of 16 The Rho GTPases Among the over 150 identified small GTPases [ 15 ] , the Rho family are a major group with ~ 20 members [ 16 ] . Their clas - sification by sequence reveals multiple arms of the family , including RhoA - like members ( RhoA , RhoB , RhoC ) , RAC1 - like members ( RAC1 , RAC2 , RAC3 , RhoG ) , and CDC42 - like members ( CDC42 , TC10 / RhoQ , TCL / RhoJ ) . The Rho , Rac and CDC42 arms of the family are classical small GTPases , as they are regulated by ‘GTPase cycling’ where the protein switches between a GDP - bound state and a GTP - bound state [ 17 ] . Due to differences in the structural conformation of the GDP - bound state and GTP - bound state , the GTP - bound ‘on’ state binds downstream effectors , but the GDP - bound ‘off’ state cannot . Control of GTPase cycling is further facilitated by the actions of guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) that assist the exchange of GDP for GTP , GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) that complete the GTPase active site to cata - lyze GTP hydrolysis to GDP + Pi , and guanine dissociation inhibitors ( GDIs ) that sequester the GTPase to prevent cycling [ 18 , 19 ] . Similarly , membrane targeting is usually required for correct spatial – temporal signaling , and this is achieved by post - translational modification of the small GTPase to cova - lently attach palmitoyl , farnesyl or geranylgeranyl groups [ 20 , 21 ] . There are many GAP , GEF and GDI proteins downstream of factors such as receptor tyrosine kinases or integrins [ 18 , 22 – 25 ] ; thus , the Rho family GTPases are essential nodes in signal transduction from a wide variety of signaling pathways to the actin cytoskeleton . The best studied members of the Rho GTPases , RhoA , RAC1 and CDC42 , control actin branching , polymerization , and severing in different ways according to their targeted actin structures . For example , RhoA regulates actin stress fibers via its effectors mDia and ROCK ; RAC1 regulates lamellipo - dia via mDia , WAVE and p21 - activated kinases ( PAK ) ; and CDC42 regulates filopodia via mDia , WASP and PAK [ 6 , 16 , 26 , 27 ] . Targeted and selective regulation of mDia , WAVE and WASP thus allows Rho small GTPases to direct spatial – tem - poral regulation of actin branching and polymerization [ 9 , 16 , 28 ] . Their regulation of actin severing , however , is achieved by a common mechanism through control of protein kinases and the phosphorylation cascade that culminates in modulation of cofilin / ADF proteins [ 29 – 31 ] . The p21 - activated kinases are well understood kinases in these cascades , playing roles downstream of CDC42 , RAC1 and other family members [ 32 – 34 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . Downstream of Rho GTPases The GTP - bound form of the Rho GTPases stimulates downstream signaling by interactions with effector pro - teins . GTPases bind to their effectors predominantly using regions termed ‘switch I’ and ‘switch II , ’ which are loops that conformationally change between the GDP - and GTP - bound forms [ 17 , 35 ] . Amino acid sequence differences in these loops allow selectivity in effector recognition [ 27 , 36 , 37 ] . Consequently , each small GTPase binds its own unique array of effectors . The three major Rho GTPases show some overlap between their distinct arrays of binding partners ; for example , the binding and activation of mDia occur for each of these small GTPases [ 38 , 39 ] . In contrast , regulation of actin branching is controlled by RAC1 via its interaction with the WAVE complex and by CDC42 via its interaction with the N - WASP complex [ 40 , 41 ] . Sequence differences between RAC1 , CDC42 and Rho impinge on the ‘dock and coalesce’ mechanism of binding Fig . 1 Schematic of RHO GTPase signaling to the actin cytoskeleton . Illustration of the major Rho GTPase pathway nodes and signals that converge on actin . The classical and most well - studied RhoGTPases are Rho , Rac , and CDC42 , which are activated by guanine exchange factors ( GEFs ) and inactivated by GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) and guanine dissociation inhibitors ( GDIs ) . The Rho GTPase effec - tors mDia , WASP , and WAVE facilitate actin polymerization and branching , whereas the Rho GTPase effector kinases—ROCK , MRCK , and PAK—regulate actin depolymerization through the LIMK - cofilin pathway Rho family GTPase signaling through type II p21 - activated kinases 1 3 Page 3 of 16 598 and prevent Rho binding to WAVE , N - WASP and other RAC1 or CDC42 effectors [ 42 – 45 ] . WASP , WAVE and mDia are the dominant effectors that regulate actin polymerization and branching downstream of Rho GTPases , but control of actin depolymerization is also required for cytoskeletal regulation [ 46 ] . This is achieved by regulation of the cofilin / ADF proteins , which in their basal state bind to actin filaments and enhance their severing [ 47 – 49 ] . A number of signals have been found to inhibit cofi - lin / ADF - mediated actin severing , but in Rho cascades , the key mechanism is phosphorylation at residue Ser3 [ 50 , 51 ] . Cofi - lin / ADF phosphorylation at residue Ser3 significantly impairs its ability to bind to actin and reduces the rate of actin sever - ing [ 52 , 53 ] . This critical serine residue is an unusually high - fidelity phosphosite and is almost exclusively phosphorylated by a small group of kinases , the LIM domain kinases [ 30 , 54 ] . Thus , the signal from Rho family small GTPases to control the length of actin filaments requires the LIM domain kinases . LIM domain kinases are multi - domain dual - specificity kinases and are highly specific in their recognition of cofi - lin / ADF proteins as substrates [ 55 – 57 ] . Like many kinases , disruption of their autoinhibited state is correlated with phosphorylation of a residue ( in this case a threonine ) in a region termed the activation loop [ 58 , 59 ] . Each of the major effector kinases downstream of the Rho GTPases are able to phosphorylate this site in the LIM kinases and therefore influ - ence actin depolymerization by cofilin . Thus , the equilibrium between active and inactive LIM kinase is altered by a Rho - dependent phosphorylation event , the consequences of which are increased cofilin / ADF phosphorylation and decreased actin severing . The major Rho GTPase effector kinases that regulate actin depolymerization include the ROCK , MRCK and PAK kinases . The ROCK family , ROCK - I and ROCK - II , are downstream of RhoA , and although there remain questions about their ability to directly interact with Rho [ 60 , 61 ] , their stimulation is key for stress fiber formation , apoptosis and proliferation , with the LIM kinases as some of their major substrates [ 39 , 62 , 63 ] . The MRCK group ( MRCK - α , - β and - γ ) is architecturally similar to ROCK and is downstream of CDC42 . These proteins play critical roles regulating the actin - myosin cytoskeleton , with major substrates including the myo - sin light chain phosphatase , myosin light chain 2 , moesin and LIM domain kinases [ 64 ] . The other major downstream group is the PAK family of serine / threonine kinases , which are major effectors of both RAC1 and CDC42 . Two groups of PAK The PAKs are major downstream effectors of RAC1 and CDC42 [ 34 , 65 – 69 ] . These six serine - specific kinases are members of the sterile - 20 kinase group and have high sequence similarity across their catalytic domains with over 50 % pairwise identities over the six proteins [ 69 – 71 ] . Nev - ertheless , there are major differences between PAK1 , PAK2 and PAK3 , the type I PAKs , and PAK4 , PAK5 and PAK6 , the type II PAKs . The sequences of the type I PAK catalytic domains are over 80 % identical , and similarly , the type II PAK catalytic domains are over 80 % identical across the subgroup [ 71 ] . The domain architecture of the type I and type II PAKs are substantially different , with type I PAKs shown to contain a short N - terminal basic region followed by a CDC42 - RAC1 interactive binding ( CRIB ) domain , an autoinhibitory domain , a flexible linker and the catalytic domain ( Fig . 2A ) . In con - trast , type II PAKs contain a shorter N - terminal basic region , a CRIB domain ( with some sequence divergence from the type I PAKs ) , an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate ( PS ) region , a flexible inter - domain region and a catalytic domain ( Fig . 2A ) . These differences in domain architecture give rise to different mechanisms of regulation for the type I and type II PAKs . Likewise , the sequentially divergent CRIB domains , which differ in residues that mediate contact with small GTPases ( Fig . 2B ) , hint at differences in binding specificity with Rho family small GTPases and , consequently , localization and tar - geting ; these differences may represent a fruitful area to better understand variations between and within the type I and type II PAK groups . The catalytic domains of the PAKs are extremely similar across the group , particularly in the region of the substrate binding site ( Fig . 2C ) . This similarity leads to an overall pref - erence for all PAK family members to recognize phospho - rylation motifs with a Ser as the substrate residue , an Arg two amino acids N - terminal to the serine , a basic residue three amino acids N - terminal to the serine , and a hydrophobic residue one amino acid C - terminal to the serine . Nonethe - less , catalytic preferences for substrates have been observed between the type I and type II PAKs with larger hydrophobic residues preferred two amino acids C - terminal to the serine for the type I PAKs , and smaller hydrophobics preferred at this position for the type II PAKs [ 65 , 72 , 73 ] . Additionally , type I PAKs favor a large hydrophobic residue three amino acids C - terminal to the phosphoacceptor serine , whereas type II PAKs favor a serine in this position [ 65 , 72 , 73 ] . Differences in substrate phosphorylation , therefore , seem to be influenced by the recognition of the substrate amino acid sequence , but this may be a minor contributing factor when compared to the effects of localization and recruitment [ 65 , 74 – 76 ] . Differences in the regulation of type I and type II PAKs The mechanisms of regulation for the type I PAKs have been well studied over the past 20 years . The type I PAKs are restricted in an inactive conformation by the N - terminal A . K . Chetty et al . 1 3 598 Page 4 of 16 autoinhibitory and CRIB domains packing against the kinase domain to prevent substrate interaction and kinase activity ; they have long been thought to assume this inactive state as a trans - autoinhibited dimer [ 78 – 80 ] . Lipids are also thought to play a role in PAK activation by interacting with polyba - sic regions of the protein [ 80 , 81 ] . Interestingly , however , recent work indicates that the type I PAKs may assume a monomeric autoinhibited state , an update to the model that suggests further study is required to fully understand the conformational regulation of type I PAKs [ 82 ] . Nonetheless , in the context of Rho GTPase signaling , the release of the autoinhibited conformation of type I PAKs is clearly associ - ated with GTPase binding to the CRIB domain , resulting in a consequent and significant increase in catalytic activity [ 78 ] ( Fig . 3 ) . This contrasts with the type II PAKs , where only a moderate increase in catalytic activity is observed upon GTPase binding in vitro [ 73 , 83 , 84 ] . Type II PAK autoregulation is mediated by a pseudosub - strate motif that is distal to the CRIB domain and thus not directly disrupted by GTPase binding [ 83 – 85 ] . This pseu - dosubstrate regulation has been observed for PAK4 crys - tallographically , and for both PAK4 and PAK6 using point mutagenesis to disrupt the autoinhibitory interactions [ 83 , 85 ] . Other mechanisms of autoregulation may also be impor - tant , and the N - terminal polybasic region was shown to play a role in regulation in vitro [ 73 , 83 , 84 ] . Based on the in vitro data , release of autoinhibition for the type II PAKs is therefore thought to occur upon binding of partner proteins to relieve pseudosubstrate - mediated regulation , rather than direct inter - ruption of the autoinhibited state by GTPase binding ( Fig . 3 ) [ 83 , 84 ] . In live cells , the regulation of type II PAKs seems to be more complicated . In particular , in vitro expression of soluble recombinant type II PAK constructs seems to require either a phosphoacceptor site on the activation loop , or muta - tion of this residue ( residue Ser474 in PAK4 ) to a glutamic acid [ 75 ] . Similarly , in live cells , multiple antibodies have been generated to recognize the activation loop phosphorylation , but this occurs only minimally following small GTPase activation but is seen in tumors [ 74 , 84 , 86 , 87 ] . Further factors control - ling type II PAK regulation remain to be fully explored and could play important roles , including perhaps binding partner / adaptor proteins [ 73 , 84 ] ; as evidence for further controlling interaction partners , INKA1 and INKA2 use pseudosubstrate interactions to bind and modulate PAK activity [ 88 , 89 ] . None - theless , spatial – temporal localization of the type II PAKs by their interactions with small GTPases seems to play a key role in controlling their signaling output , although how this locali - zation is achieved warrants further study . Roles of the type II PAKs in signal transduction Type I and type II PAKs play a variety of roles in cytoskel - etal remodeling , cell motility , inhibition of apoptosis , and transcription regulation to the cytoskeleton [ 65 , 67 , 90 ] and Fig . 2 Type I and type II PAK similarities .

They act in response to Rho family small GTPases , more of the specifics of which are discussed below , and signal through a range of target substrates by phospho - rylation . Major substrates that are common to type I and type II PAK family members include LIM domain kinases , GEF - H1 ( ARHGEF2 ) , β - catenin , BAD and paxillin . These substrates impact actin severing , adhesion structures and transcriptional regulation and result in similar phenotypic outcomes from both type I and type II PAKs . Both PAK groups phosphorylate LIM domain kinases , which result in reduced actin severing . Similarly , both PAK groups phos - phorylate the RhoGEF , GEF - H1 , on residue Ser885 to sup - press its RhoGEF activity [ 92 ] ; Ser885 phosphorylation facilitates 14 – 3 - 3 binding and the sequestering of GEF - H1 to microtubules [ 19 , 92 ] . GEF - H1 phosphorylation provides a mechanism of cross talk between CDC42 and Rho signal - ing , as discussed below . PAKs are important for the WNT / β - catenin pathway , and phosphorylation of the transcription factor β - catenin is one of the best described of the PAK substrates . This phospho - rylation occurs primarily on residue Ser675 , although other sites have also been reported [ 93 – 96 ] . β - catenin shuttles between junctional , cytoplasmic and nuclear pools to medi - ate signaling in the WNT pathway , and its Ser675 phospho - rylation by PAK favors nuclear translocation and activation of transcriptional targets [ 95 , 97 , 98 ] . Ser675 phosphoryla - tion is thought to suppress β - catenin degradation by ubiq - uitination , which allows accumulation in the nucleus [ 98 ] , and studies on the Drosophila type II PAK , Mbt suggest that β - catenin phosphorylation may represent an evolutionarily well - conserved function [ 99 ] . Interestingly , lysine methyla - tion of PAK4 by SETD6 has been found to promote the acti - vation of WNT / β - catenin and increase the interactions of PAK4 with substrates such as β - catenin , implying a further layer of regulation for PAK4 - β - catenin signaling [ 100 ] . Three further commonly cited substrates for PAK are BAD , Raf - 1 and paxillin . BAD , the BCL - 2 antagonist of cell death , promotes apoptosis through its interactions with BCL - 2 and BCL - X L , and PAK phosphorylation is thought to inactivate BAD and inhibit these interactions , providing anti - apoptotic protection [ 70 , 101 – 103 ] , but it has been suggested that in live cells , the PAK - mediated phosphorylation of BAD may be due to alternate pathways , or be kinase independent [ 104 – 106 ] . Also facilitating anti - apoptotic protection , PAKs interact with Raf - 1 , activating it through phosphorylation on residue Ser338 and targeting it to the mitochondria [ 107 ] . Similarly , paxillin is thought to be phosphorylated on resi - due Ser272 in the FAK - binding LD4 motif by both PAK1 and PAK4 , consequently suppressing the ability of paxillin to bind to FAK and promoting its ability to bind to GIT1 , both of which are proteins important for focal adhesion regu - lation and signaling [ 108 – 110 ] . It should be noted , however , that not all groups who have studied paxillin have observed this phosphorylation [ 104 ] . These substrates are thought to be common across at least one type I and one type II PAK family member , indicating an overlap in signaling outcomes across the family among Fig . 3 Schematic of the regulation mechanisms of the type I and type II PAKs . A Type I PAKs exist in a trans - autoinhibited dimer , and GTPase binding to the CRIB domain removes this inhibition , allow - ing for autophosphorylation and activation of the kinase domain [ 78 – 80 ] . B Type II PAKs exist in a monomeric autoinhibited state in which the kinase domain binds a pseudosubstrate distal from the CRIB domain [ 83 ] . GTPase binding to the CRIB domain perturbs pseudosubstrate binding but kinase activity remains suppressed , sug - gesting that type II PAK activation is dependent on additional partner proteins to relieve autoinhibition [ 73 ] A . K . Chetty et al . 1 3 598 Page 6 of 16 the array of PAK - subgroup and PAK - specific outcomes [ 34 , 66 , 91 , 104 ] . Amino acid and structural level comparisons of the type I and type II PAKs illustrate strong similarity in their surface residues that mediate direct recognition of substrates , but differences in substrate selectivities of PAK family members have been shown [ 67 ] . In addition to its interaction with LIMK , PAK4 regulates actin dynamics by phosphorylating slingshot ( SSH ) phos - phatase and N - WASP . PAK4 has been found to phospho - rylate and inhibit slingshot ( SSH ) phosphatase , regulating the ability of SSH to dephosphorylate and inactivate cofilin and LIMK [ 111 , 112 ] . In addition , an analysis of the PAK4 interactome found that PAK4 can promote actin polymeri - zation through a pathway independent of LIMK , by phos - phorylating N - WASP at Ser484 / Ser485 to facilitate Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization [ 113 ] . While it remains unclear whether other PAKs phosphorylate N - WASP , PAK1 has been shown to phosphorylate Arp2 / 3 to promote actin polymerization [ 114 ] . These findings highlight some of the paths through which PAKs propagate polymerizing and depolymerizing signals to actin . Further exploration is therefore needed to determine the similarities and overlap of signaling pathways for the full PAK family . Roles of type II PAK kinase domain substrate and pseudosubstrate interactions For the PAK substrates , direct interactions of the kinase domain with short linear motif ( SLiM ) regions of their sub - strate are the most straight forward mechanism of recogni - tion and targeting [ 115 , 116 ] . The kinase domain is also responsible for recognizing pseudosubstrate motifs that regulate activity . Crystallographic analyses have been con - ducted for a range of these kinase - substrate and kinase - pseu - dosubstrate pairs , allowing a more complete understanding of how targeting is controlled . Each of the pairs that have so far been co - crystallized interact in a linear motif fash - ion—the peptide binds in an extended arrangement allow - ing placement of an amino acid side chain in the location of phosphorylation , termed the P − 0 position . The peptides extend N - and C - terminal of this position and are numbered P − 1 , P + 1 , etc . , respectively ( Fig . 4A ) . For PAK4 substrates , co - crystal structures have been determined in complex with peptides from LIMK1 and β - catenin , and with consensus peptides developed by positional scanning techniques [ 76 , 115 ] . In each of these structures , PAK4 is found in an active state with the acti - vation loop phosphorylated , DFG - in , and with active state ‘hydrophobic spines’ [ 117 , 118 ] . The mode of interaction between the kinase and the substrate is well conserved across these complexes , with two major features playing a role in linear motif recognition . The first feature is the dominant interaction of the complex and comprises a salt bridge forming between an arginine residue at position P − 2 , and an acidic bowl centered around PAK4 residues Asp444 and Asp507 , and bounded by residues Ser443 , Thr404 and Trp481 . The second feature is a van der Waals interaction C - terminal of the phosphosite occupied by the side chain of either amino acid P + 1 or P + 3 . This shallow hydropho - bic patch is bounded by PAK4 residues Leu475 , Pro479 , Met482 , Pro520 , and Leu521 , and Met 524 . The locations of these sites seem to guide preferred substrate specificity and be responsible for major components of linear motif recognition ( Fig . 4B ) . Two further recognition sites seem to be more minor and responsible for selecting an arginine / lysine residue at position P − 4 by PAK4 residues Glu512 and Asn517 , and a hydrophobic residue at position P + 2 by PAK4 residues Val476 , the DFG + 1 residue ( Phe461 ) and a hydrophobic patch at the N - terminus of the C - helix . In this way , the PAK4 substrates seem to follow a conserved man - ner of interaction with the kinase domain . The broad features of kinase - substrate interactions are conserved in the pseudosubstrate inhibitory interactions of PAK4 . For the pseudosubstrate co - crystal structures , the P + 1 and P + 2 positions invariably interact with both the major and minor hydrophobic regions discussed above . Sim - ilarly , the dominant interaction between an arginine residue and the acidic bowl centered around residues Asp444 and Asp507 is observed in all of the pseudosubstrate complexes . However , one major difference between the kinase - substrate pairs and the kinase - pseudosubstrate pairs seems to arise in the determined structures : the position of this arginine relative to the phosphosite varies . Multiple structures have been observed where the acidic bowl is engaged by an argi - nine at the P − 3 register , rather than the P − 2 consistently observed in the kinase - substrate pairs . In the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate structures of PAK4 , the arginine at P − 3 is followed by a proline at P − 2 , which kinks the backbone to properly orient arginine P − 3 into the acidic bowl ; this is a distinct difference between the kinase - substrate and kinase - autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate complexes . Interestingly , this position in the acidic bowl is also occupied by a P − 3 arginine in the full - length PAK4 complex with CDC42 [ 73 ] . RHOA , RAC1 and CDC42 interactions with type II PAKs Another important mechanism of control for signaling is through localization , which is primarily achieved by PAK interactions with Rho family small GTPases . Of the three major Rho family small GTPases , the PAKs do not interact with RhoA , but are instead restricted to binding CDC42 and RAC1 [ 74 ] . They were the first protein kinases to be shown to be RAC1 and CDC42 effectors [ 120 ] , and all PAKs are Rho family GTPase signaling through type II p21 - activated kinases 1 3 Page 7 of 16 598 usually considered to be effectors of both RAC1 and CDC42 . Nonetheless , the type II PAks have been found to have a preference for binding to CDC42 over RAC1 [ 74 , 121 ] , and this has been demonstrated biophysically by comparison of in vitro affinities , where CDC42 is an approximately tenfold tighter binder to PAK4 compared to the RAC1 - PAK4 inter - action [ 73 ] . These data suggest that the type II PAKs are primarily effectors of CDC42 rather than equally CDC42 and RAC1 . CDC42 plays roles in the Golgi , at cell – cell junctions , at the leading edge of cells , and is important for cell polarity [ 122 ] . PAK4’s interaction with CDC42 was found to induce filopodia formation , which required both PAK4’s kinase activity and correct localization [ 74 , 123 ] . CDC42 directs localization of PAK4 from the perinuclear region to the Golgi , which facilitates the role of PAK4 in filopodia - related actin polymerization [ 74 , 124 , 125 ] . PAK4 also plays a role in CDC42 - mediated response to genomic instability [ 126 ] . CDC42 is an important regulator of cell polarity , and PAK4 contributes to the direction of cell polarity on its localization to cell – cell junctions by CDC42 [ 93 ] . CDC42 targeting of PAK4 to cell substratum seems to be localized to the podo - some ring - core interface and is key to podosome formation and migration of myeloid cells , macrophages and prostate cancer cells [ 108 , 127 , 128 ] . Furthermore , colocalization of PAK4 and the CDC42 effector protein , Par6B , is important for cell – cell adhesion maturation and apical - basal polarity ; their interaction provides another layer to CDC42 - directed colocalization whereby PAK4 phosphorylates Par6B in its CDC42 - binding CRIB domain that interrupts CDC42 binding and turnover of Par6 at apical junctions [ 129 , 130 ] . CDC42 is a strong candidate as a universal intracellular compass and works in concert with RAC1 to control cel - lular directionality , with PAKs potentially playing a role in these effects [ 13 , 131 , 132 ] . Localization and catalytic activity are also required for proper function of PAK5 [ 133 ] and PAK6 [ 134 , 135 ] . In contrast to other type II PAKs , PAK5 may achieve auto - activation through kinase oligomerization , but the role of localization in facilitating this auto - activation is unclear [ 136 ] . PAK5 localization , like that of PAK4 , is affected by CDC42 . PAK5 primarily localizes to the mitochondria and nucleus , which seem to be driven by N - terminal mitochon - drial localization and nuclear localization signal regions [ 102 , 137 ] . Upon CDC42 binding , PAK5 and CDC42 colo - calize at lamellipodial focal adhesions and filopodia [ 138 , Fig . 4 Substrate recognition of PAK4 .

Similarly , the CDC42 interaction with PAK6 is necessary for PAK6 to localize at cell – cell adhesions and drive epithelial colony escape [ 134 ] . CDC42 binds the PAK6 CRIB domain and N - terminal poly - basic region allowing for cell – cell adhesion targeting so that PAK6 activity can facilitate adhesion dissociation and cell colony escape [ 134 ] . PAK6 also contains nuclear localiza - tion signals , and an androgen receptor binding motif [ 71 , 102 , 140 ] . CDC42 may be required to achieve a full activation of PAK4 . Cell biological assays suggest a potential increase in catalytic activity when CDC42 is induced [ 84 ] , and a bio - physical and enzymatic analysis of one of the full - length PAK4 isoforms suggested an unusual multi - step regulation mechanism , where CDC42 plays a role in achieving full activation [ 73 ] . In these studies , CDC42 seems to competi - tively displace the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate by using an extended interface . It does this in such a way as to main - tain a suppression of kinase activity , suggesting that CDC42 may play a role in finely tuning catalytic activity of the type II PAKs [ 73 ] . Interestingly , although much of the work on PAK4 and the type II PAKs has focused on their role in CDC42 signal - ing , CDC42 is not always required for correct targeting . For example , PAK4 can be correctly localized to the cell periph - ery downstream of hepatocyte growth factor and independ - ent of CDC42 binding [ 141 ] , suggesting roles for other Rho family small GTPases . Future studies will doubtless further explore how CDC42 facilitates type II PAK localization and the mechanisms of how this localization relates to type II PAK activation . Type II PAK interactions with Rho family small GTPases , RhoV , RhoU and RhoD In addition to CDC42 and RAC1 , there is also growing evi - dence that the type II PAKs bind other Rho family small GTPases , suggesting roles as effector kinases in some of the less well - studied Rho family signaling pathways . These partners seem to be arrayed across the Rho family dendro - gram [ 15 ] ( Fig . 5 ) . The evidence for PAK interaction with the CDC42 branch family members TCL ( RhoJ ) and TC10 ( RhoQ ) is limited [ 142 ] ; however , a recent study suggested PAK4 may indeed interact with TCL and TC10 proteins , along with RAC3 and RhoG [ 38 ] . Similarly , there is little evidence for PAK binding to RhoB and RhoC . The PAK family members do not bind to the pseudoGTPase mem - bers of the Rho Family , RND1 , RND2 , RND3 , RhoBTB1 , RhoBTB2 , RhoBTB3 and Miro1 and Miro2 [ 143 ] . In con - trast , there is growing evidence for type II PAK binding to RhoU ( Wrch - 1 , Wnt responsive Cdc42 homolog 1 ) and RhoV ( Chp , Cdc42Hs homolog protein ) , and to RhoD . Initial identification of RhoV was by yeast 2 - hybrid screens where it was shown as a PAK2 binding protein [ 144 , 145 ] , and the type I PAKs seem to be canonical effectors for RhoU and RhoV [ 38 , 145 – 147 ] . Curiously , however , mutation of a number of residues in RhoU that interrupt its binding to PAK1 does not interrupt its interaction with PAK4 , potentially suggesting differences in the recognition of these partner proteins [ 145 , 148 ] . Furthermore , the type II PAK interaction with RhoU and RhoV seems to play a role in stabilization of these proteins rather than as a canoni - cal GTPase effector pair . PAK4 binds to RhoU in MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cell lines and inhibits RhoU protea - somal degradation , leading to an increase in RhoU signaling and promotion of focal adhesion turnover and cell migration [ 148 ] . The regulation of focal adhesion turnover by RhoU may be associated with its ability to target PAK4 to paxillin and consequent paxillin phosphorylation on Ser272 [ 145 , 148 ] . RhoV colocalizes with PAK6 at vesicular structures , but similar to RhoU - PAK4 , the interaction was not found to increase the level of phosphorylated PAK6 [ 145 , 149 ] . Also , like RhoU - PAK4 , it has been suggested that RhoV degrada - tion may be suppressed by PAK6 binding [ 145 ] . Fig . 5 Dendrogram of Rho family small GTPases indicating known type II PAK binders . Type II PAKs have been found to bind CDC42 , RhoU , RhoV , RhoD , and to RAC1 and RAC2 ( highlighted in green ) , and potentially for RhoJ , RhoQ , RAC3 and RhoG ( highlighted in light green ) . RhoGTPase sequences were collected from Uni - Prot [ 152 ] : RND1 _ HUMAN , RND2 _ HUMAN , RND3 _ HUMAN , RHOB _ HUMAN , C9JX21 _ HUMAN , RHOC _ HUMAN , RHOD _ HUMAN , RHOF _ HUMAN , RHBT1 _ HUMAN , RHBT2 _ HUMAN , RHBT3 _ HUMAN , RHOG _ HUMAN , RAC2 _ HUMAN , RAC1 _ HUMAN , RAC3 _ HUMAN , CDC42 _ HUMAN , RHOQ _ HUMAN , RHOJ _ HUMAN , RHOU _ HUMAN , RHOV _ HUMAN , RHOH _ HUMAN , MIRO1 _ HUMAN , and MIRO2 _ HUMAN . Dendrogram was constructed using Clustal Omega for multiple sequence align - ment [ 77 ] and Interactive Tree of Life v6 . 5 . 4 [ 153 ] Rho family GTPase signaling through type II p21 - activated kinases 1 3 Page 9 of 16 598 Interaction with RhoD has been demonstrated to target PAK5 to different locations in the cell compared to its inter - action with CDC42 . RhoD primarily targets PAK5 to mito - chondria [ 139 ] . RhoD is known to suppress cell migration [ 150 ] , but it seems unlikely that PAK5 is involved in this function since the PAK5 - RhoD interaction occurs in the mitochondria [ 139 ] . In contrast , RhoD binds to PAK6 and targets it to plasma membrane blebs where PAK6 inhibits RhoC activation of ROCK [ 151 ] . In Vaccinia infected cells , the F11 virus protein binds to RhoD and inhibits the RhoD binding and localization of PAK6 , causing excessive cell contraction , blebbing , and apoptosis [ 151 ] . Similar to RhoD , RhoH can interact with PAK5 in vitro and in transfected cells , but as RhoH is restricted to hematopoietic stem cells where PAK5 expression is limited , it is unclear whether the PAK5 - RhoH interaction occurs in vivo [ 139 ] . Role of type II PAKs in cross talk between Rho family small GTPases Spatiotemporal regulation of RhoGTPase signaling is criti - cal for their activities , and balancing of these signaling cas - cades is associated with cross talk between the Rho family GTPases [ 154 ] . A few examples have been found of type II PAKs mediating cross talk between the antagonistic CDC42 / RAC1 and RhoA pathways , namely through the interaction of PAK4 with PDZ - RhoGEF and GEF - H1 . PAK4 binds to and phosphorylates PDZ - RhoGEF ( ARHGEF11 ) , a RhoA activator , to inhibit RhoGEF GTP - loading activity [ 155 ] . In melanoma cell lines , PAK4 phosphorylation of PDZ - RhoGEF is thought to indirectly inhibit RhoA activation at invadopodia , facilitating invadopodia maturation [ 156 , 157 ] . The interaction between PAK4 and PDZ - RhoGEF is mediated by a C - terminal exon ( exon 37 ) , a region subject to alternative splicing in mesenchymal epithelial cells ; this mesenchymal - specific exon results in PAK4 recruitment and reduced RhoA activity in mesenchymal cells , compared to epithelial cells , and is associated with disruption of tight junctions [ 158 ] . Another example of cross talk between type II PAK sign - aling and RhoGTPase cascades is the regulation of GEF - H1 ( ARHGEF2 ) . PAK4 colocalizes and interacts with GEF - H1 on Golgi membranes and microtubules , an interaction that is mediated by a region in PAK4 encompassing residues 276 – 324 , slightly N - terminal of the kinase domain ; this region is conserved across the type II PAKs and may rep - resent a common recruitment site [ 71 , 159 ] . PAK4 phos - phorylates GEF - H1 at residue Ser885 , leading to RhoGEF inactivity [ 160 ] , which in turns leads to inhibition of RhoA , activation of RAC1 , stress fiber dissolution and lamellipodia formation [ 108 , 159 ] . While the role of CDC42 in localizing PAK4 to the Golgi is well characterized [ 74 , 124 , 125 ] , it has not been investigated whether PAK4 and GEF - H1 colocali - zation is CDC42 - dependent . Interestingly , it has been sug - gested that PAK4 may serve as a scaffold , bringing together GEF - H1 and CDC42 , or as an indirect regulator of RhoGT - Pase localization by directing GEF - H1 localization through phosphorylation [ 159 ] . Roles of type II PAKs in disease The type II PAKs play roles in a range of pathways that are important for disease acquisition and progression , including in various cancers and in neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson’s disease . In a number of large human cancers , there is extensive evidence that PAK4 has increased expres - sion and activity [ 69 , 91 , 161 ] , along with a correlation between PAK4 overexpression and poor patient prognosis [ 161 ] . These effects seem to be associated with overexpres - sion , but not with recurrent acquired missense mutations [ 162 ] , and are thought to mechanistically impact adhesion dynamics , epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , and the tumor microenvironment [ 69 , 91 , 161 ] . The phospho - rylation of PAK substrates , particularly β - catenin , is thought to promote cancer progression [ 163 ] , and PAK4 activation of cAMP response element - binding protein ( CREB ) and CREB - regulated transcriptional cofactor 1 ( CRTC1 ) may be important for cAMP signaling in cancer [ 164 ] . PAK4 may function in reciprocal regulation of PI3K / AKT [ 165 ] . In multiple cancers , PAK4 is thought to be important for Ras - mediated transformation , including colon cancer [ 124 ] , breast cancer [ 166 ] , and rhabdomyosarcoma [ 167 ] . The PAKs may also play important roles in hematological malig - nancies [ 168 ] and may help confer drug resistance to MAPK inhibitors in mutant BRAF melanomas [ 163 , 168 , 169 ] . Much of the focus for type II PAKs in disease has cen - tered on cancers in which these proteins are overexpressed , but there is also growing evidence that reduced type II PAK activity may contribute to progression of neurodegenera - tive diseases , particularly Parkinson’s disease . In Parkinson’s disease , decreased levels of active PAK4 are exhibited in postmortem brain tissue , and constitutively active PAK4 protects dopaminergic neurons and preserves motor func - tion in rat models of Parkinson’s disease [ 170 ] . Furthermore , the loss of the PAK4 homolog in Drosophila melanogaster , Mbt , causes reduced dopaminergic neurons and Parkinson - like phenotypes [ 171 ] . Some of these effects may be due to alterations in α - synuclein aggregation via the endosome - lysosomal pathway [ 172 ] ; when PAK4 activity is reduced , α - synuclein aggregation increases , which feeds back to reduced PAK4 activity [ 172 , 173 ] . The PAK4 - NEDD4 - 1 pathway has therefore been proposed as a potential therapeu - tic target for Parkinson’s disease [ 172 ] . Conversely , PAK6 activity and interaction with leucine - rich repeat kinase 2 A . K . Chetty et al . 1 3 598 Page 10 of 16 have been reported to promote the progression of Parkin - son’s disease [ 174 ] , raising the possibility of different type II PAK pathways impacting Parkinson’s . The type I PAKs have been implicated in other neurodegenerative diseases , includ - ing Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington’s disease [ 175 ] , and recently , PAK4 was implicated in amyotrophic lateral scle - rosis ( ALS ) [ 176 ] . Clearly , the roles of the type II PAKs in neurodegenerative disease are still not fully understood . The importance of PAKs in cancer and the implication of their role in Parkinson’s disease [ 170 , 177 ] and in survival of multidrug resistant bacteria [ 178 ] suggest that development of targeted inhibitors may prove to be therapeutically useful . Multiple PAK4 inhibitors are under development , though development has focused on targeting PAK4 in cancers . Two have reached clinical trials ( PF - 3758309 ceased due to low bioavailability , and KPT - 9274 currently ongoing ) [ 164 , 179 , 180 ] . KPT - 9274 is currently being investigated to treat non - Hodgkin’s lymphoma [ 164 ] ( ClinicalTrials . gov Identi - fier : NCT04281420 ) and refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( NCT04914845 ) , and in preclinical studies , KPT - 9274 has demonstrated antitumor effects in a range of other cancers [ 181 ] . Recent work has shown that PAK4 inhibition may complement PD - 1 blockade immunotherapy in the treat - ment of melanoma , by downregulating the WNT signaling pathway via reduced phosphorylation of β - catenin residue Ser675 and reducing β - catenin shuttling to the nucleus [ 95 , 100 , 182 , 183 ] . PAK4 inhibition may also augment CAR - T therapy for glioblastoma by stabilizing the tumor vascu - lar microenvironment through reduced phosphorylation of the transcription factor MEF2D on residue Ser180 ( in a PRLL [ S ] PQQP linear motif , with arginine at the - 3 position ) and consequent regulation of adhesion protein expression [ 184 ] . Some recent work suggests that PAK inhibition may increase the tumor immune response and complement gem - citabine treatment in pancreatic cancers [ 185 , 186 ] . PAK4 inhibition therefore is thought to be therapeutically attractive in a range of tumors [ 69 , 161 ] . Advances in PAK4 inhibi - tors were most recently discussed in two 2022 reviews [ 181 , 187 ] . Summary The p21 - activated protein family are key players in signal transduction pathways downstream of Rho family GTPases . Their functions and roles in signaling and disease are becom - ing better understood , and extensive structural studies have revealed a range of aspects describing the molecular basis of their signaling and regulation . We continue to learn new insights to these interesting and important proteins . Acknowledgements We acknowledge Ben Turk and David Calderwood for helpful discussions .
