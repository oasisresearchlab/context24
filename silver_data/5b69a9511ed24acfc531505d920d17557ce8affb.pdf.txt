Volunteer challenge studies have provided detailed data on viral shedding from the respiratory tract before and through the course of experimental inﬂuenza virus infection . There are no comparable quantitative data to our knowledge on naturally acquired infections . Methods . In a community - based study in Hong Kong in 2008 , we followed up initially healthy individuals to quantify trends in viral shedding on the basis of cultures and reverse - transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) through the course of illness associated with seasonal inﬂuenza A and B virus infection . Results . Trends in symptom scores more closely matched changes in molecular viral loads measured with RT - PCR for inﬂuenza A than for inﬂuenza B . For inﬂuenza A virus infections , the replicating viral loads determined with cultures decreased to undetectable levels earlier after illness onset than did molecular viral loads . Most viral shedding occurred during the ﬁrst 2 – 3 days after illness onset , and we estimated that 1 % – 8 % of infectiousness occurs prior to illness onset . Only 14 % of infections with detectable shedding at RT - PCR were asymptomatic , and viral shedding was low in these cases . Conclusions . Our results suggest that “silent spreaders” ( ie , individuals who are infectious while asymptomatic or presymptomatic ) may be less important in the spread of inﬂuenza epidemics than previously thought . Inﬂuenza virus is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide through seasonal epidemics and occasional emergence of novel strains that lead to pandemics [ 1 ] .

However , in volunteer chal - lenge studies , the participants are typically young adults who have been screened to ensure that they have low levels of preexisting immunity to the inﬂuenza strain of interest ; thus , the ﬁndings may not generalize to the overall population annually at risk for naturally ac - quired infections [ 2 ] . There are few data on viral shed - ding after naturally acquired inﬂuenza virus infection in a community setting . The proportion of infections that are asymptomatic or subclinical and the degree to which these are contagious , as well as the proportion of shedding that occurs prior to onset of symptoms , affects the potential impact of control measures . We studied trends in clinical illness and viral shedding as - sociated with naturally acquired inﬂuenza virus infec - tions in a community setting . METHODS We conducted a community - based study of the effec - tiveness of face masks and hand hygiene to prevent inﬂuenza transmission in households during 2008 [ 3 ] .

A positive result for inﬂuenza virus infection on a rapid antigen test was used to determine eligi - bility of the index cases’ households for additional follow - up . Index cases and household contacts were eligible regardless of preexisting conditions or treatment prescribed , but index cases who had household members with concurrent inﬂuenza - like illness were excluded [ 3 , 4 ] . There was no recorded use of antiviral prophylaxis . Symptom diaries were provided to all household members at an initial home visit within 24 – 48 h of index case recruitment to record respiratory and systemic symptoms daily ; 82 % of initial home visits were conducted within 12 h of index case recruitment [ 3 ] . Compliance with symptom reporting was high ; all symptom diaries were com - plete with the exception of 12 ( 0 . 6 % ) of 2170 entries . We pro - vided each household with a digital tympanic thermometer and asked all household members to record their body temperature daily . Household members were followed up for ∼ 7 days to observe secondary infections . Pooled nose and throat swab ( NTS ) specimens were collected from all household members regardless of illness at the initial home visit and at 2 follow - up visits 3 ( (cid:3) 1 ) and 6 ( (cid:3) 2 ) days later . Because index cases are likely to have higher viral loads , given their positive result on a rapid test [ 5 ] , and are less likely to have mild illness given that they sought outpatient care , all analyses here focus only on the household contacts to avoid selection bias . Laboratory methods . NTS specimens from household con - tacts were tested by quantitative reverse transcription poly - merase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) to detect inﬂuenza A or B virus infection and determine molecular viral loads . Total nu - cleic acid was extracted from specimens by using the NucliSens easyMAG extraction system ( bioMe´rieux , Boxtel , the Nether - lands ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Twelve mi - croliters of extracted nucleic acid was used to prepare com - plementary DNA by using an Invitrogen Superscript III kit ( Invitrogen ) with random primer as described elsewhere [ 6 ] . For detection of inﬂuenza A virus , 2 m L of complementary DNA was ampliﬁed in a LightCycler 2 . 0 system ( Roche Di - agnostics ) , with a total reaction - mix volume of 20 m L reaction containing FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I Mix reagent kit ( Roche Diagnostics ) , 4 . 0 mmol / L MgCl2 and 0 . 5 mmol / L of each primer . The forward primer ( 5 (cid:2) - CTTCTAACCGAGGT - CGAAACG - 3 (cid:2) ) and the reverse primer ( 5 (cid:2) - GGCATTTTGGAC - AAAKCGTCTA - 3 (cid:2) ) were used for ampliﬁcation of the matrix gene of inﬂuenza A virus [ 7 ] . Cycling conditions were as fol - lows : initial denaturation at 95 (cid:4) C for 10 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95 (cid:4) C for 10 s , 60 (cid:4) C for 3 s , and 72 (cid:4) C for 12 s , with ramp rates of 20 (cid:4) C / s . At the end of the assay , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) products were subjected to a melting - curve analysis to determine the speciﬁcity of the assay . The lower limit of detection of the RT - PCR assay was 23 virus gene copies per reaction ( ie , ∼ 900 copies / mL ) . For detection of inﬂuenza B virus , forward ( 5 (cid:2) - GCATCTTT - TGTTTTTTATCCATTCC ) and reverse ( 5 (cid:2) - CACAATTGCCT - ACCTGCTTTCA ) primers and 5 (cid:2) nuclease probe ( Fam - TGCT - AGTTCTGCTTTGCCTTCTCCATCTTCT - TAMRA ) were used for ampliﬁcation of the matrix gene [ 8 ] . Testing was performed by using the TagMan EZ RT - PCR system . Core reagent kit ( Applied Biosystems ) , with 0 . 8 m mol / L of forward and reverse primers and 0 . 2 m mol / L of probe in a total reaction volume of 25 m L , comprising 4 m L of nucleic acid extract . Ampliﬁcation and detection was performed on an ABI StepOneTM real - time PCR system ( Applied Biosystems ) under the following con - ditions : initial hold at 50 (cid:4) C for 20 min and 95 (cid:4) C for 15 min , followed by 45 cycles at 95 (cid:4) C for 15 s and 60 (cid:4) C for 1 min . NTS specimens were additionally tested by quantitative vi - ral dilutions to detect median tissue culture infectious dose ( TCID 50 ) and determine replicating viral load . Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells were grown on microtiter plates . The cells were rinsed in serum - free minimum essential medium ( Gibco ) . The NTS specimen was diluted initially by 1 in 5 and then in 10 - fold steps in serum - free minimum essential medium containing tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone - treated trypsin ( 2 m g / mL ) ( Sigma Aldrich ) . One hundred mi - croliters of the undiluted NTS specimen as well as each of the specimen dilutions was added in quadruplicate to the MDCK cell monolayers . Medium alone was added to control cells . An additional 100 m L of serum - free minimum essential medium with 2 m g / mL trypsin was added to each well , and the plates were incubated at 33 (cid:4) C for 7 days . The plates were evaluated for cytopathic effect daily . The TCID 50 was determined ac - cording to the Reed and Muench Method . The lower limit of detection was ∼ 10 0 . 3 TCID 50 . Statistical analysis . We calculated daily scores grouped as systemic signs and symptoms ( fever of (cid:1) 37 . 8 (cid:4) C , headache , and myalgia ) , upper respiratory symptoms ( sore throat and runny nose ) , and lower respiratory symptoms ( cough and phlegm ) by summing the presence versus absence of each symptom or sign and dividing by 3 , 2 , and 2 , respectively [ 2 ] . We deﬁne acute respiratory illness ( ARI ) as (cid:1) 2 of the 7 symptoms listed above [ 9 ] . We plotted average symptom scores by time since ARI onset , which was deﬁned as the ﬁrst day when the subject reported (cid:1) 2 of the 7 symptoms . We plotted quantitative viral loads by time since ARI onset and calculated daily geometric means , imputing half the lower limit of detection ( ie , 450 cop - ies / mL and 0 . 15 log 10 TCID 50 ) for the undetectable values . As a sensitivity analysis , we plotted viral shedding by time since onset of fever of (cid:1) 37 . 8 (cid:4) C .

RESULTS We followed up 1015 household contacts in 322 households . A total of 135 ( 13 % ) contacts were conﬁrmed with RT - PCR to have inﬂuenza virus infection . Because we recorded symp - toms prospectively and were particularly interested in patterns of viral shedding and symptoms around illness onset , for this analysis we excluded 59 contacts for whom the ﬁrst NTS spec - imens collected were RT - PCR positive regardless of whether ARI was reported at the ﬁrst home visit , and an additional 17 contacts who met the criteria for ARI onset at the ﬁrst home visit with inﬂuenza virus infection subsequently conﬁrmed with RT - PCR . Characteristics of the excluded 76 contacts were sim - ilar to those of the 59 retained contacts ( Table 1 ) . Of the 59 secondary infections analyzed here , 16 were caused by inﬂuenza A / H1N1 viruses , 17 by inﬂuenza A / H3N2 viruses , and 1 by both inﬂuenza A / H1N1 and A / H3N2 confection , with the re - mainder by inﬂuenza B virus . Forty - six ( 78 % ) of 59 subjects were persons aged 16 years or older . At ARI onset , the most common symptoms were cough , nasal congestion , runny nose , and sore throat ( Table 2 ) . Of the 34 subjects infected with inﬂuenza A viruses , 15 ( 44 % ) reported a temperature of (cid:1) 37 . 8 (cid:4) C on at least 1 day over the course of illness , whereas 21 ( 62 % ) reported having a temperature of (cid:1) 37 . 8 (cid:4) C on at least 1 day , taking antipyretic medication , or both . The correspond - ing proportions for inﬂuenza B virus infections were 8 ( 32 % ) of 25 subjects and 13 ( 52 % ) of 25 subjects . Thirty ( 51 % ) of 59 subjects reported seeking medical care . Peak molecular viral shedding for inﬂuenza A virus infection as assessed with RT - PCR occurred on the day of ARI onset , followed by a steady decrease in viral shedding through the following 7 days ( Figure 1 ) . The pattern of viral shedding for A / H1N1 and for A / H3N2 subtypes were similar ( data not shown ) . Viral shedding was detected with RT - PCR in 4 ( 27 % ) of 15 subjects ( 95 % conﬁdence interval [ CI ] , 8 % – 55 % ) , with a specimen collected 1 day before ARI onset . Inﬂuenza B viral shedding was more variable over time and a clear peak was not observed ; initial shedding was detected at 1 – 2 days before ARI onset in 4 ( 29 % ) of 14 subjects ( 95 % CI , 8 % – 58 % ) and per - sisted for ∼ 6 days before subsiding . We did not have sufﬁcient sample size to explore differences in viral shedding between children and adults . In inﬂuenza A virus infections the replicating viral load de - termined by viral culture peaked on the day of ARI onset and steadily decreased over ∼ 5 days ( Figure 1 ) . For inﬂuenza virus B infections , the TCID 50 levels initially peaked on the day of ARI onset and were more variable over time . Molecular viral shedding was most closely correlated with replicating viral load on the day after ARI onset . As replicating viral load decreased more rapidly with time , the association between molecular viral shedding and replicating viral load became weaker later in the course of illness ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . Replicating viral load de - termined with viral culture was detected in 1 adult with inﬂu - enza A infection and 2 adults and 3 children with inﬂuenza B infection before ARI onset . We found that a modiﬁed lognormal form provided a good ﬁt to the molecular viral shedding patterns for inﬂuenza A virus infections . If infectiousness were proportional to molecular vi - ral shedding , most infectiousness would occur within 2 – 3 days of ARI onset , whereas if infectiousness were proportional to D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / ji d / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 201 / 10 / 1509 / 992720 b y gue s t o n 30 M a r c h 2019 1512 • JID 2010 : 201 ( 15 May ) • Lau et al Figure 1 .

We did not ﬁnd any parametric forms that provided a good ﬁt to the inﬂuenza B molecular viral shedding patterns , or replicating viral load for inﬂuenza A or B measured by TCID 50 . In both inﬂuenza A and B virus infections , mean tympanic temperature and trends in average scores for systemic signs and symptoms peaked at the day of ARI onset and then steadily subsided to baseline after 3 – 5 days ( Figure 1 ) . On average , upper respiratory and lower respiratory symptom scores peaked at ARI onset ; however , respiratory symptoms resolved less quickly than systemic symptoms and signs ( Figure 1 ) .

There was also a positive correlation between number of symptoms and molec - ular viral shedding ( data not shown ) . Data were insufﬁcient to repeat these analyses for inﬂuenza B virus infections .

Viral shedding measured with RT - PCR peaked 1 day before fever resolution . Shedding was detected in 4 ( 44 % ) of 9 subjects ( 95 % CI , 14 % – 79 % ) after fever resolution . Symptom trends , mean tympanic temperature , and replicating viral load mea - sured by TCID 50 all followed a similar trend . In a sensitivity analysis , we investigated viral sheddingrelative to onset of fever of (cid:1) 37 . 8 (cid:4) C in the subset of 22 subjects who reported a fever and found that trends in viral shedding were generally consistent with the main analysis based on ARI onset ( data not shown ) . DISCUSSION There are few data in the literature on the patterns in infec - tiousness in inﬂuenza virus infections over time , and how in - fectiousness may be related to viral shedding or symptoms . We investigated 3 alternative simple models for infectiousness in inﬂuenza A virus infections and found that if infectiousness is proportional to viral RNA shedding ( or log 10 viral shedding or presence / absence of shedding ) , then the majority of infectious - ness occurs within 1 – 2 days ( or 3 – 4 days ) after ARI onset ( Figure 4 ) . Given the more rapid decrease in replicating viral load compared with molecular viral shedding ( Figure 1 ) , we may have overestimated the duration of infectiousness . In pre - vious work , we estimated the mean serial interval of inﬂuenza to be 3 . 6 days [ 9 ] , given an incubation period of 1 . 5 – 2 days [ 13 ] . This implies that the average time between ARI onset and subsequent transmission to household contacts was ∼ 2 days , D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / ji d / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 201 / 10 / 1509 / 992720 b y gue s t o n 30 M a r c h 2019 1514 • JID 2010 : 201 ( 15 May ) • Lau et al Figure 4 . Proportion of infectiousness remaining by time since acute respiratory illness ( ARI ) onset in the course of naturally acquired inﬂuenza A virus infection . Infectiousness assumed proportional to ( A ) molecular viral shedding , ( B ) log 10 molecular viral shedding , and ( C ) presence of molecular viral shedding in excess of 900 copies / mL under the ﬁtted curve . Figure 5 . Association between tympanic temperature and molecular inﬂuenza A viral shedding by reverse - transcription polymerase chain re - action by day since acute respiratory illness ( ARI ) onset for children ( plus signs ) and adults ( circles ) . Linear regression lines are plotted where there are (cid:1) 3 points . ARI onset is deﬁned as at the ﬁrst day with (cid:1) 2 of the 7 signs or symptoms listed in Table 1 . NTS , nose and throat swab specimen . which is consistent with infectiousness proﬁles in between a proportional relationship with log 10 viral shedding and viral shedding . From a detailed model of inﬂuenza transmission in households in a French household study [ 14 ] , Ferguson et al estimated that infectiousness was highest around the time of illness onset , and that the infectiousness proﬁle correlated closely with viral shedding [ 15 ] , whereas in our data viral shed - ding peaked within 1 – 2 days of symptom onset ( Figure 1 ) . Similarly , Pitzer et al [ 16 ] found that moderate increases in transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome 5 – 10 days after illness onset appeared more consistent with changes in log viral shedding rather than viral shedding over the same period [ 17 ] . Because the majority of viral shedding measured with RT - PCR or TCID 50 occurred within 2 – 3 days of ARI onset , isolation of patients or other interventions must be applied very soon after ARI onset ; otherwise , they could not have any substantial effectiveness in reducing onwards transmission . Our data are consistent with data from previous studies that documented the time lines of inﬂuenza viral shedding from volunteer challenge studies [ 2 ] . We found that inﬂuenza A viral shedding measured with RT - PCR peaked around the same day as ARI onset before decreasing . Whereas some viral shedding was detectable with RT - PCR before ARI onset , this occurred in a minority of cases . Daily replicating viral shedding measured with TCID 50 for inﬂuenza A virus infections decreased faster than viral shedding measured with RT - PCR . Patterns in viral shedding associated with inﬂuenza B virus infections were more variable and followed a pattern similar to that of data observed in volunteer challenge studies , with shedding at substantial lev - els from ARI onset through to 5 days after ARI onset [ 2 ] . We found that levels of replicating virus measured by TCID 50 had high correlation with molecular viral loads measured with RT - PCR soon after ARI onset but diverged as the infection pro - gressed when TCID 50 decreased more rapidly ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . A previous study also found that viral culture is less sensitive than RT - PCR later in the course of illness [ 18 ] , perhaps because inactivated virus or viral DNA persist in the respiratory tract towards the end of illness . In both inﬂuenza A and B virus infections , systemic symp - toms and signs subsided more rapidly than respiratory symp - toms [ 2 ] . The decrease of systemic signs and symptoms , pri - marily fever , correlated closely with the decrease in viral shed - ding , most likely due to the subsiding of immune response with the gradual clearing of virus from the body [ 19 ] . Resolution of fever could also be affected by use of antipyretic medication . The correlation between higher tympanic temperature and higher viral shedding ( Figure 5 ) suggests that individuals with a higher fever could be more infectious in general . Eight ( 14 % ) of the 59 individuals ( 95 % CI , 6 . 0 % – 25 % ) with RT - PCR – conﬁrmed secondary infections did not report any clinical signs or symptoms , and in total 15 ( 25 % ) of 59 subjects ( 95 % CI , 15 % – 38 % ) were asymptomatic ( reporting 0 of 7 signs or symptoms ) or subclinical ( reporting 1 of 7 signs or symp - tom ) . Our upper bound for the frequency of asymptomatic infection is somewhat lower than that identiﬁed in volunteer challenge studies [ 2 ] or from longitudinal studies including pre - and post - season serology with illness recall [ 20 ] . It is possible that we failed to detect infections associated with lower levels of viral shedding or shedding for a shorter period , because swab samples were collected on average only at 3 - day intervals , and proportionally more such infections may be asymptomatic [ 2 , 21 ] . Some individuals may have been infected without shed - ding virus . It is still unknown whether or to what degree asymp - tomatic individuals could transmit infection to others [ 22 ] , although mathematical models typically assume that 33 % – 50 % of infections are asymptomatic or subclinical , and these indi - viduals are approximately half as infectious as symptomatic persons [ 23 , 24 ] .

US pandemic guidelines suggest sick individuals should re - main home for a minimum of 24 h after fever resolution in the absence of fever - reducing medication [ 25 ] . In our study of seasonal inﬂuenza predominantly among adults , viral shedding resolved within the recommended exclusion period for 10 ( 83 % ) of 12 individuals with febrile inﬂuenza A virus infection , suggesting that the exclusion period covers the majority of infectiousness for febrile infections if the patterns of fever and viral shedding are similar to that in pandemic inﬂuenza . A strength of our study is that we analyzed laboratory - con - ﬁrmed , naturally acquired inﬂuenza virus infections in a com - munity setting , which should allow broad generalizability . It is important also to note the limitations of our study . First , be - cause of sample - size limitations , our study was underpowered to explore in detail the differences by age and other charac - teristics . Second , because our study design tended to exclude households with 1 1 case at the recruitment stage , subjects in our study could be biased toward those having a lower risk of infection or illness [ 3 ] . Third , although we have investigated alternative models for the relationship between infectiousness and viral shedding , it is possible that speciﬁc symptoms also play an important role in infectiousness . Fourth , we have a relatively small sample size , and more data would be valuable to more precisely characterize patterns in viral shedding and illness , and particularly viral shedding associated with asymp - tomatic infections and before illness onset . Finally , we did not record symptoms in household contacts retrospectively , so we were unable to include in this analysis household contacts with evidence of inﬂuenza virus infection at the initial home visit ; however , the general characteristics of excluded contacts were similar to those of contacts who were included ( Table 1 ) . One research gap highlighted by our work is the need for studies that collect paired serologic data as well as detailed viral shedding data . This would allow more accurate estimates of the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic or subclin - ical , and the characteristics of viral shedding in asymptomatic infections . Future studies of naturally acquired infections with increased frequency of clinical specimens and a longer follow - up period would also contribute valuable knowledge about the shape of the peak and duration of viral shedding . If combined with data on transmission to contacts , these studies may be able to provide additional information on the relations between viral shedding , illness , and infectiousness , which wouldfacilitate optimal application of interventions and control measures . Vol - unteer challenge studies can provide useful data , but large de - tailed studies of naturally acquired infections are essential to inform differences in time lines and trends by age and other characteristics .
