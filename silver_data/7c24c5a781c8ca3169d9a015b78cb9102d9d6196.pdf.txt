Database ( 2016 ) Vol . 2016 : article ID baw062 ; doi : 10 . 1093 / database / baw062 Received 22 December 2015 ; Revised 23 March 2016 ; Accepted 3 April 2016 Abstract Attempts are frequently made to investigate adverse ﬁndings from preclinical toxicology studies in order to better understand underlying toxicity mechanisms . These efforts often begin with limited information , including a description of the adverse ﬁnding , knowledge of the structure of the chemical associated with its cause and the intended pharmacological tar - get . ToxEvaluator was developed jointly by Pﬁzer and the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database ( http : / / ctdbase . org ) team at North Carolina State University as an in silico platform to facilitate interpretation of toxicity ﬁndings in light of prior knowledge . Through the inte - gration of a diverse set of in silico tools that leverage a number of public and proprietary databases , ToxEvaluator streamlines the process of aggregating and interrogating diverse sources of information . The user enters compound and target identiﬁers , and selects ad - verse event descriptors from a safety lexicon and mapped MeSH disease terms . ToxEvaluator provides a summary report with multiple distinct areas organized according to what target or structural aspects have been linked to the adverse ﬁnding , including primary pharmacology , structurally similar proprietary compounds , structurally similar public do - main compounds , predicted secondary ( i . e . off - target ) pharmacology and known secondary pharmacology . Similar proprietary compounds and their associated in vivo toxicity ﬁndings are reported , along with a link to relevant supporting documents . For similar public domain compounds and interacting targets , ToxEvaluator integrates relationships curated in Comparative Toxicogenomics Database , returning all direct and inferred linkages between them . As an example of its utility , we demonstrate how ToxEvaluator rapidly identiﬁed direct ( primary pharmacology ) and indirect ( secondary pharmacology ) linkages between cerivasta - tin and myopathy .

When the adverse findings are serious enough relative to the intended therapeutic indication , development of the molecule may be temporarily or even permanently halted , reducing the availability of new medicines for patients . Depending on a number of independent factors , including the indication and the nature of the finding , an ad hoc multidisciplinary team of scientists may be created to fur - ther characterize the adverse finding . This ‘issue - manage - ment team’ is usually focused on developing an understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism ( s ) leading to the toxicity , as well as determining the relevance of the adverse finding to human health . The human - rele - vance point can be critical for continued development of the molecule , as the lack of a direct translation of a preclin - ical observation has been demonstrated for a number of both marketed and investigational therapeutics ( 1 , 2 ) . The first step of an investigative team usually involves a period of comprehensive hypothesis generation to explore possible underlying mechanisms . The purpose of this idea - generation stage is to identify the most plausible , testable hypotheses so that resources can be rapidly deployed for follow - up experiments with the most informative out - comes . With a typically limited window of opportunity to derive these hypotheses , efficiency at this stage of work can be critical to the success of the effort . ToxEvaluator was developed as an in silico platform to facilitate rapid and comprehensive hypothesis generation for toxicity findings . Created with a user - friendly interface , ToxEvaluator was designed to integrate the information an investigative toxicologist would typically gather at the start of such a project , and to execute many of the time - consuming analyses needed to explain a toxicity finding . As ToxEvaluator is a proprietary application and therefore not publicly available , the aim of this article is to describe its design and functionality with the intent to inform the development of related applications . Design and development Proprietary databases and tools ToxEvaluator was designed to leverage and integrate a number of existing proprietary and publicly available tools and databases that are ideally used in interrogation work - flows by investigative toxicologists . Proprietary resources include databases of in vitro pharmacological activity , in vivo preclinical toxicology study findings ( referred to at Pfizer as in vivo Data Environment—or IVDE ) and compound structure libraries ( > 4 million compounds ) . The IVDE database includes only study findings that were attributed to the compound , and utilizes an in - house de - veloped safety lexicon of toxicology and pathology terms for describing the findings ( see supplementary material ) . Proprietary ( i . e . developed by Pfizer ) in silico tools inte - grated in ToxEvaluator function to predict unintended pharmacology ( Polypharmacology ) , compute compound similarity and link intended pharmacological targets with toxicology - related gene information ( ToxReporter ) . The Polypharmacology tool consists of a collection of 771 indi - vidual classification models , one for each target incorpo - rated in the tool . The individual classification models were trained using a combination of internal screening data and bioassay data from external sources including the GVK - Bio GoSTAR database ( 3 ) and ChEMBL ( 4 ) . Similar to other described polypharmacology models ( 5 ) , this tool en - ables querying by compound identifier / structure and the return of probabilistic predictions of possible targets with which the compound may interact . A compound similarity tool is integrated into ToxEvaluator to identify other compounds of potential interest based on structural similarities to the compound being evaluated . The tool utilizes structure - encoding mo - lecular fingerprint descriptors ( 6 ) and a Tanimoto similar - ity algorithm ( 7 ) to generate a similarity score within the context of user - defined thresholds . In this way , users may uncover structural analogs from compound libraries and link the similar compounds to reports related to the ad - verse event being investigated . The ToxReporter tool links target ( gene ) information to the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man ( OMIM ) ( 8 ) via Gene database ( 9 ) . Links between OMIM entries and tox - icity categories are inferred through the MeSH categories of the PubMed articles cited in the OMIM entries . ToxReporter links to the Mouse Genome Informatics ( MGI ) ( 10 ) genetic databases via phenotype information for mouse gene mutations . Finally , ToxReporter incorpor - ates tissue expression data , Gene Ontology data ( 11 ) and MeSH - based ( 12 ) literature mining functionality to iden - tify and flag sources of information linking a given target with selected organ toxicity terms . Comparative Toxicogenomics Database The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database ( CTD ) ( 13 ) is a publicly available resource that provides compound – gene , compound – disease , and gene – disease interactions and relationships that are manually curated from the scien - tific literature by professional biocurators . In 2012 , CTD’s content was expanded as a result of a collaboration be - tween Pfizer and CTD to text mine and manually curate a Page 2 of 13 Database , Vol . 2016 , Article ID baw062 collection of over 88 000 articles ( 14 ) . CTD content has been integrated in ToxEvaluator using Web services specif - ically developed by North Carolina State University for Pfizer to leverage these curated relationships . The inter - actions and relationships in CTD enable direct integration with the gene and compound centric output from Pfizer’s proprietary tools . CTD annotates many of the interactions and relationships according to whether there is a dir - ect relationship between the gene – disease and compound – disease pairs [ denoted as Marker or Mechanism ( M ) or Therapeutic ( T ) ] , or an inferred relationship between them based on a statistical enrichment of co - interacting third partners ( 15 ) . ToxEvaluator incorporates all three of these annotation types into its output . The availability of curated chemical – gene and chem - ical – disease interactions in CTD allows CTD’s MeSH - based chemical library to be searched for similar compounds that can be linked to the adverse finding . This was accomplished by downloading the CTD chemical li - brary and transforming the structural descriptors for each chemical in Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System format ( 16 ) into the molecular fingerprint descriptors us - able by the chemical structural similarity tool integrated in ToxEvaluator . Compounds identified as being similar within the context of user - specified thresholds are readily utilized in chemical – disease queries based on the MeSH chemical identifier that was retained with the structural in - formation in the initial library download . ToxEvaluator input Ease of use One important goal of the tool was to improve access to mechanism - based toxicity data for a broad range of users . As such , the query interface was purposefully designed to allow entry of information commonly used for toxicity in - vestigations such as the compound identifier , the target identifier and a description of the adverse finding . By focusing on these three areas and incorporating features such as autocomplete and default similarity thresholds , ToxEvaluator simplifies the input process and facilitates access to integrated results . Compound identifier Input of a compound identifier is critical as a number of workflows depend on the identifier directly or the associ - ated chemical structure . Acceptable compound identifiers include proprietary Pfizer identifiers ( e . g . PF - 1234567 ) and common names . Workflows using these identifiers include in vitro assay data look - up for secondary pharmacology targets ( identifier driven ) , in silico prediction of secondary pharmacology targets ( structure driven ) , and identification of structurally similar compounds using internal ( propri - etary ) and external ( CTD ) data sets ( structure driven ) . Auto - complete functionality assists the user with input by suggesting compound identifiers in a drop - down box as the initial characters are being entered . Target identifier ToxEvaluator also accepts a primary drug target as input . The majority of drug discovery projects attempts to de - velop a novel molecule that specifically and potently inter - acts with an individual , endogenous , target molecule . As the target molecule is typically a protein that is encoded by a gene , a HUGO gene identifier ( 17 ) is required for input . A target ID is used by ToxEvaluator to identify links be - tween the target itself and the finding being investigated . An auto - complete functionality assists the user with target input . Description of adverse finding The third piece of required input is a description of the ad - verse finding . This is critical as the primary function of ToxEvaluator is to find relationships between molecules , targets and the finding of interest . In order for ToxEvaluator to identify these relationships in proprietary and public databases that use different structured vocabu - laries / ontologies ( e . g . CTD—MeSH , IVDE—safety lexi - con ) , a master file of mapped terms was created ( see supplementary material ) . As the adverse finding is often some form of organ or tissue toxicity , MeSH and safety lexicon terms were assigned in the mapping process to organ / tissue terms common to both ontologies . For con - sistency in selecting adverse finding descriptions in IVDE and CTD , the user begins by selecting an organ / tissue term , which then restricts the IVDE and MeSH selections to the mapped terms . The user is then directed to select terms that reflect the same or similar findings within IVDE and CTD . ToxEvaluator workflow The workflows integrated in ToxEvaluator are provided in Figure 1 . As described above , the input information ( top row boxes ) consists of the intended target ( gene ID ) , the compound ID and the description of the adverse finding . Computational ( similar compound identification , off - target prediction ) and data look - up ( assay data / second - ary target ID ) steps based on the input compound form the majority of the initial steps . Secondary targets and similar Database , Vol . 2016 , Article ID baw062 Page 3 of 13 compounds that cross default thresholds ( EC50 < 10 m M and 50 % similarity , respectively ) are combined with the in - put target and cross - checked against CTD , IVDE and ToxReporter for linkages to the adverse terms entered . Figure 2 provides an overview of the technical architec - ture behind ToxEvaluator and a description of the major technologies integrated into the tool . From a software en - gineering perspective , automating the ToxEvaluator work - flows required developers to integrate a highly diverse set of remote information resources . The methods used for ac - cessing these resources were similarly diverse , ranging from Web service - and Common Gateway Interface - based communications , to remote database querying in both MySQL and Oracle environments , to remote process exe - cution . The formats and methods of information exchange were as varied as the resources themselves , including XML , JSON , flat text and direct file - based interchange . When a ToxEvaluator query is executed , over a dozen logically multithreaded , asynchronous remote internal and CTD - based service calls are made to secure , compile and summarize the extracted information . All user queries are saved to an Oracle database management system , enabling users to easily revise and / or rerun queries . The CTD - based services were developed , optimized and intended specific - ally for Pfizer use . The Java EE 7 computing platform , within the context of Apache / Tomcat and the Spring Framework , was used for software development . These tools collectively provided the functionality and flexibility required to effectively address the disparate demands of ToxEvaluator . Although ToxEvaluator is a Web - based tool , it is accessible only with proper user authentication within Pfizer’s virtual / private network domain . The ToxEvaluator logical workflow comprised an input layer , a computation layer and an output layer . The input and output layers are analogous to the ToxEvaluator home - page and report pages , respectively ( Figures 3 and 4 ) . The computation layer represents the programmatic steps inte - grated by ToxEvaluator to identify the links that may support new hypotheses . The output layer contains six result sections grouped according to the types of links they are capable of generating ( e . g . through a secondary pharmacology target that was identified via Polypharmacology ) . ToxEvaluator output Primary pharmacology output Two separate workflows , one internal ( ToxReporter ) and one external ( CTD ) , focus on the potential role of the pri - mary target in the adverse finding of interest . The CTD Gene – Disease Association report will return any direct or indirect links found between the input target and the adverse Figure 1 . ToxEvaluator Workﬂow . The ToxEvaluator workﬂow comprised an input layer , a compute layer and an output layer . The input layer allows the selection of a compound ID , a target and a description of the adverse ﬁnding . The compute layer represents the programmatic steps integrated by ToxEvaluator to identify the relationships between the input descriptors that may help support new hypotheses . The output layer displays the compute layer results in six areas that can be deﬁned according to the types of relationships identiﬁed .

ToxReporter searches and returns rela - tionships between an input target ( i . e . gene ) and an adverse finding from various data sources including the OMIM and MGI databases , primary target tissue expression , Gene Ontologies and the literature ( PubMed ) , using the input MeSH term . ToxReporter provides a summary score metric reflecting the number of links found between the target and the safety lexicon term , relative to all other targets . A sum - mary view of ToxReporter output can be seen in Figure 5 . Figure 2 . ToxEvaluator Technical Architecture . A ToxEvaluator user ( 1 ) initiates a request using the Web - based ToxEvaluator user interface over Pﬁzer’s virtual / private network . The ToxEvaluator server - side software ( 2 ) processes the request , making approximately one dozen multithreaded in - ternal and CTD - based Web service calls , compiling , harmonizing and summarizing the results . A summary report with hyperlinks to more detailed in - formation is then returned ( 3 ) to the end user for analysis . Major technologies are summarized ( 4 ) . Figure 3 .

Database , Vol . 2016 , Article ID baw062 Page 5 of 13 Structural similarity output The External Compound Similarity report identifies pub - lic - domain compounds with comparable structures and searches for associations to the input finding . Similarly , the Internal Compound Similarity report identifies proprietary compounds with similar structures to the input compound , and associates these compounds with instances where find - ings identical to the one entered were observed in prior toxicology studies . This report will also alert the user to structurally similar proprietary compounds where any ad - verse findings were observed in prior toxicology studies . Although we cannot include an example figure of this sec - tion as it contains proprietary data , we can report that the data fields include the compound identifier of the similar compound , the similarity score , the study findings , the study title and identifier , and preclinical species used in the study . Live links to the full study report are available as well as in - depth information on the similar compound from internal databases . Secondary pharmacology output The Polypharmacology report identifies computationally predicted off - targets of the compound , and determines whether these off - targets can be linked to the adverse find - ing via CTD gene – disease relationships . Similarly , the Activity Profile report identifies known ( via in vitro assay data ) unintended targets of the compound , and determines whether these targets can be linked to the adverse finding via CTD gene – disease relationships . ToxEvaluator example Case study of Cerivastatin - associated myopathy ToxEvaluator has been used in many internal project - based issue - management initiatives since being developed , often resulting in the rapid identification of compelling hypotheses and informatics and / or experimental follow up . Because its use to - date has been in support of ongoing pro - prietary programs , we are unable to provide detailed ex - amples of its use at Pfizer . Instead , we include an example using ToxEvaluator to investigate the observation of myol - ysis with the HMG CoA reductase ( HMGCR ) - targeting drug cerivastatin to illustrate its utility . In this example , the user begins on the ToxEvaluator in - put page ( Figure 3 ) by entering the known drug target , HMGCR , the internal compound identifier for cerivastatin ( PF - 00346556 ) , and the adverse terms reflecting myolysis in the IVDE ( myolysis ) and CTD ( muscular diseases ) data - bases . Default values for compound similarity ( 50 % ) and maximum similarity score hits ( 100 ) are left unchanged and the user selects ‘Analyze’ . ToxEvaluator performs the workflows in Figure 1 and returns the output page as seen in Figure 4 . ToxEvaluator Figure 4 . ToxEvaluator output : cerivastatin - myolysis example . A view of the ToxEvaluator output page showing analysis results for the cerivastatin - myolysis example . Page 6 of 13 Database , Vol . 2016 , Article ID baw062 output is organized according to the underlying connec - tions being made ( see ‘ToxEvaluator workflow’ section for details ) . For example , the Activity Profile section ( Figure 4 , upper right ) reflects findings based on known pharmaco - logical targets of cerivastatin from our proprietary data - base that have been linked to the input term ‘muscular diseases’ by one or more CTD gene : disease relationships . Primary pharmacology output For this example , we focus on four areas of the output page . First is the identification of a direct association be - tween HMGCR , the target of cerivastatin and muscular diseases in the CTD Gene – Disease Association output ( Figure 4 , bottom right ) . By selecting the references link in the Direct association section , the user is directed to the CTD Gene – Disease page for HMGCR – Muscular Diseases ( Figure 6 ) . The supporting reference there ( 18 ) reports a connection between anti - HMGCR antibodies and an im - mune - mediated form of myopathy in a patient following exposure to statin therapy . This connection might support the hypothesis that an immune - mediated mechanism due to anti - HMGCR antibodies could be contributing to the incidence of myopathy being investigated by the user , a hy - pothesis that could be tested for supporting experimental evidence . External compound similarity output A second area of focus is the identification in the External Compound Similarity output ( Figure 4 , middle right ) of three public - domain compounds with structural similarity Figure 5 . ToxReporter summary page for the HMGCR target . ToxReporter summary page for the input target ( HMGCR ) showing Tox scores for high - level target organ and mechanism areas across mouse and humans . Flags are visible for those data sources where potential links to the adverse ﬁnd - ing of interest have been identiﬁed . Database , Vol . 2016 , Article ID baw062 Page 7 of 13 to cerivastatin , one of which has a directly curated rela - tionship to the MeSH term ‘Muscular Diseases’ . The user may then select the available link to open the External Compound Similarity Results page to investigate this po - tential lead ( Figure 7 ) . In viewing this page , the user sees that the compound of similar structure is cerivastatin itself . Selecting the link under the CTD References area , ToxEvaluator opens the CTD cerivastatin – Muscular Diseases references page ( Figure 8 ) , providing the user with a selection of publications supporting the relationship be - tween cerivastatin and this adverse finding ( 19 , 20 ) . This connection , while less useful in terms of building causal mechanistic hypotheses for cerivastatin - associated myoly - sis , is important in that it demonstrates how ToxEvaluator can also identify known linkages between molecules and adverse findings . Polypharmacology output The Polypharmacology section of the output ( Figure 4 , upper left ) reports the identification of 44 targets that ceri - vastatin is predicted to interact with and that CTD has linked to muscular diseases . Selecting this link opens the Polypharmacology Results page ( Figure 9 ) where the user is presented with the direct ( HMGCR ) and indirectly linked predicted targets . Reference links are available for each predicted target for evaluation of supporting evidence by the user and the selection of compelling potential targets for follow - up testing . Secondary pharmacology output The links in the Activity Profile area on the output page are of particular interest for this example . As mentioned previously , the Activity Profile workflow attempts to iden - tify links between known unintended targets ( i . e . second - ary pharmacology ) and the adverse finding of interest . ToxEvaluator does this by identifying targets from a pro - prietary database where the input compound ( e . g . cerivas - tatin ) has demonstrated an IC50 or EC50 value of < 10 m M and cross checking these targets at CTD for relationships to the input MeSH term . For this example , the Activity Profile output reported that 13 secondary targets have been identified for cerivas - tatin , and that a direct link to muscular diseases was found for two of the targets . Targets with a direct linkage to the disease term have supporting literature that clearly de - scribes a mechanism - or treatment - based relationship be - tween them and are thus connections of primary interest . In cases where targets with direct linkages to the disease term are not identified , targets with indirect linkages could be investigated . Selecting the link available , the user opens the Activity Profile Results page ( Figure 10 ) , which identi - fies the direct - linked known - pharmacology targets associ - ated with muscular diseases as HMGCR ( discussed above ) and solute carrier organic anion transporter family mem - ber 1B1 ( SLCO1B1 ) . Selecting the link for SLCO1B1 under the CTD References area , ToxEvaluator opens the SLCO1B1 – Muscular Diseases references page at CTD ( Figure 11 ) , providing the user with publications support - ing the relationship between SLCO1B1 and muscular dis - eases ( 21 , 22 ) . SLCO1B1 is a liver - specific organic anion transporter . Functionally , it is involved in the uptake of a number of endogenous ( e . g . bilirubin ) and small - molecule drugs from the blood into the hepatocytes of the liver . Its identi - fication as a secondary target of cerivastatin by ToxEvaluator and linkage to muscular diseases by CTD may lead the user to derive a hypothesis that inhibition of SLCO1B1 by cerivastatin may inhibit its own clearance from the blood , resulting in elevated serum drug levels , a finding that has been associated with statin - associated myolysis ( 23 ) . Discussion Serious preclinical toxicology study findings can delay or halt the development of potential new medicines . They can also lead to substantial investigative efforts of the underly - ing mechanism ( s ) in order to understand the relevance of the risk to patients or to help avoid the adverse finding for Figure 6 .

Page 8 of 13 Database , Vol . 2016 , Article ID baw062 follow - on molecules of the class . Due to the nature of the drug discovery and development processes , the window of opportunity to perform this investigative work is limited , and tools capable of making this work more efficient can have a significant impact on the overall success of the ef - fort . ToxEvaluator was developed as an in silico tool with utility to rapidly integrate relevant internal and external data capable of supporting the generation of mechanistic toxicology hypotheses . To accomplish this , it was designed to automate workflows used by investigative toxicologists attempting to understand why a particular adverse finding has been observed . The software design for ToxEvaluator began with the creation of wireframe diagrams of each workflow to be automated . In this process we captured each step in a workflow from input to output , identifying tools and data - bases available for each workflow . In some cases , existing workflow tools were leveraged and integrated into Figure 7 . External compound similarity results . External compound similarity results view showing public - domain compounds with similarity to ceri - vastatin ( including cerivastatin ) with direct and indirect links curated by CTD to the input term .

Database , Vol . 2016 , Article ID baw062 Page 9 of 13 ToxEvaluator without modification ; in other cases , exist - ing applications had to be modified and / or optimized to ac - commodate the content and real - time performance demands of ToxEvaluator . New applications were written to allow access to data that was required but not previ - ously remotely accessible . This wireframing process served a number of useful purposes , including providing a descrip - tion of the workflow with details required for the software development , and an understanding of the disparate for - mats of the underlying tools and databases required to be integrated . As a result , many of the decisions that went into selecting a particular software tool were made to ac - commodate the existing and / or new formats and allow their integration within the application . Changes were made to the wireframe diagrams throughout the design and development lifecycle as more was understood about the requirements of ToxEvaluator , and the availability of data sources . The wireframe diagrams proved to be invalu - able in providing a simple , common , well - grounded under - standing of our design during this highly dynamic process . Cerivastatin - associated myopathy was used as an ex - ample of ToxEvaluator’s utility in uncovering meaningful direct and indirect connections . In this example , a direct relationship was rapidly identified between the primary target of cerivastatin , HMGCR and myopathy in a patient that had been exposed to statin therapy . The identification of anti - HMGCR antibodies in the patient’s blood sup - ported the authors’ assertion that the myopathy is the re - sult of an immune - mediated mechanism ( 18 ) . Importantly , for the toxicologist using ToxEvaluator , the discovery of this relationship can form the basis to suspect a similar mechanism behind the myopathy under investigation , one Figure 9 . A view of the Polypharmacology results page showing the identiﬁcation of a predicted high probability target ( HMGCR ) that has been dir - ectly linked to myolysis by CTD . Page 10 of 13 Database , Vol . 2016 , Article ID baw062 that could be tested experimentally for supporting evidence . The relationship between cerivastatin and SLCO1B1 ( off - target ) that was uncovered in an internal database provided the link to the direct connection between SLCO1B1 and my - opathy curated within CTD . Taken together these relation - ships support a hypothesis that inhibition of SLCO1B1 by cerivastatin could be leading to myopathy . A similar - exter - nal - compound ( e . g . cerivastatin ) to muscle disease connec - tion confirmed the association . This example illustrates how ToxEvaluator can rapidly , comprehensively and consistently perform investigative toxi - cology workflows and present the user with relationships among primary sources of information that can form the basis for plausible and testable hypotheses . The automated incorporation of orthogonal data such as structurally similar compounds and unintended pharmacology that can form the basis of mechanistic links to adverse findings is a distinguish - ing capability of ToxEvaluator . Clearly , it would be impracti - cal for toxicologists to manually render the unified , coherent content provided by ToxEvaluator on a consistent basis , given the volume , complexity , and dynamic nature of an underlying dataset that is only accessible across such a broad and diverse spectrum of resources , platforms and tools . Moreover , although it is conceivable that a skilled investiga - tive toxicologist may have eventually manually uncovered some or perhaps all of these threads of evidence , ToxEvaluator retrieves these findings for the user in seconds . Additionally , by automating these workflows , queries can be rerun easily over time as databases are updated , something that , again , would be impractical using a manual approach . Figure 10 .

Database , Vol . 2016 , Article ID baw062 Page 11 of 13 Although ToxEvaluator represents an important step forward for those engaged in investigative toxicology work , it does have limitations . One of these is the relatively narrow focus of the tools and databases integrated in the current version . To address this limitation , a future version of ToxEvaluator could integrate tools or databases from among the many other publicly available resources ( e . g . NCBI , EMBL , etc . ) . A second limitation for ToxEvaluator is access , which is restricted to internal company use due to the proprietary nature of many of the integrated tools and data . However , our intention in describing the rationale behind this tool , its design and development , and a case study is to stimulate further development of the concept and the availability of similar tools in the public domain . Notably , CTD’s rich , publicly available content could be readily leveraged by any group interested in developing such a tool . ToxEvaluator represents an evolution in the area of in silico tools and databases as applied to toxicology by ena - bling novel mechanistic insights through the integration of existing resources . As more and newer sources of data are generated and utilized successfully in defined workflows , the likelihood for synergistic gains through their integra - tion to other databases increases . Although this version of ToxEvaluator has automated several commonly used first - order relationships ( e . g . known target to disease term ) , there are additional workflows that could be incorporated in future versions to expand the exploratory workflow op - tions . Examples include the automation and integration of potential secondary target identification methods such as significant sequence identity overlap with the input target , protein domain structural similarity ( e . g . for kinase targets ) , or chemical - genomics approaches ( i . e . targets identified via shared active compounds ) .
