Chang , Michael Hull , and Ira Mellman Department of Cell Biology , Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT 06520 y screening for mutants exhibiting interactions with a dominant - negative dynamin , we have identiﬁed the Drosophila homologue of receptor - mediated endocy - tosis ( Rme ) 8 , a J - domain – containing protein previously shown to be required for endocytosis in Caenorhabditis elegans . Analysis of Drosophila Rme - 8 mutants showed that internalization of Bride of sevenless and the uptake of tracers were blocked . In addition , endosomal organization and the distribution of clathrin were greatly disrupted in Rme - 8 cells , suggesting that Rme - 8 participates in a clathrin - dependent process . The phenotypes of Rme - 8 mutants bear B a strong resemblance to those of Hsc70 - 4 , suggesting that these two genes act in a common pathway . Indeed , bio - chemical and genetic data demonstrated that Rme - 8 interacts speciﬁcally with Hsc70 - 4 via its J - domain . Thus , Rme - 8 appears to function as an unexpected but critical cochap - erone with Hsc70 in endocytosis . Because Hsc70 is known to act in clathrin uncoating along with auxilin , another J - protein , its interaction with Rme - 8 indicates that Hsc70 can act with multiple cofactors , possibly explaining its pleiotropic effects on the endocytic pathway . Introduction Endocytosis , a process common to all eukaryotic cells , plays a critical role not only in the internalization of extracellular macromolecules , but also in the down - regulation of signaling receptors from the cell surface . One major route of endocy - tosis is the clathrin - mediated pathway , characterized by the selective internalization of receptors and bound ligands via clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ; Schmid , 1997 ; Kirchhausen , 2000 ) . To form CCVs at the plasma membrane , AP - 2 adaptors , coat proteins , and clathrin are recruited to coated pits , where the assembly of clathrin into lattice - like structures induces the inward curvature of the membrane . The pits then grow with successive additions of coat proteins , and eventually detach from plasma membrane as CCVs in a dynamin - dependent process . After detachment , the clathrin coats are dissociated from CCVs and are reused for subsequent rounds of endocytosis . Hsc70 , a constitutively expressed member of the Hsp70 chaperone family , has been implicated in many stages of this CCV cycle . In vitro , Hsc70 can promote the release of clathrin triskelions and other coat proteins from CCVs by binding to clathrin and thus disrupting the clathrin cage concomitant with ATP hydrolysis ( Schlossman et al . , 1984 ; Chappell et al . , 1986 ; Ungewickell et al . , 1995 ) . In addition , Hsc70 can bind to PP2A which , in turn , can modulate the affinity of adaptor complexes for cargo proteins by dephos - phorylation ( Ghosh and Kornfeld , 2003 ) . Thus , Hsc70 may participate in the release of adaptor proteins , as well as clathrin , from CCVs ( Hannan et al . , 1998 ; Ghosh and Kornfeld , 2003 ) . After uncoating , Hsc70 remains associated with clathrin triskelions and may have a role in priming clathrin for future rounds of CCV formation ( Schlossman et al . , 1984 ; Jiang et al . , 2000 ) . Recent evidence has further suggested that Hsc70 , along with its cochaperone auxilin ( see next paragraph ) , binds to dynamin in vitro and may have a role in the early steps of CCV formation ( Newmyer et al . , 2003 ) . Despite these advances in understanding the biochemical details of Hsc70 in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , its precise function in vivo remains difficult to demonstrate . That Hsc70 is important in intact cells has been substantiated by experi - ments perturbing Hsc70 function , either by the expression of dominant - negative mutant alleles ( Newmyer and Schmid , 2001 ) or by selection of Hsc70 mutants in Drosophila ( Chang et al . , 2002 ) . In these examples , inhibition of Hsc70 function under physiological conditions caused defects in clathrin - dependent internalization and in receptor recycling The online version of this article includes supplemental material .

Because of the myriad cellular roles of Hsc70 , it may be eas - ier to analyze a particular Hsc70 function in vivo by character - izing specific J - domain – containing cochaperones with which it is likely to interact . The J - domain , a conserved motif shared by members of the DnaJ protein family , can bind to Hsp70 fam - ily proteins and stimulate their low intrinsic ATPase activity ( Ungewickell et al . , 1995 ; Bukau and Horwich , 1998 ; Kelley , 1999 ) . The relevant cochaperone in the clathrin uncoating re - action is thought to be auxilin , which contains clathrin - bind - ing domains as well as the J - domain ( Ungewickell et al . , 1995 ; Umeda et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , the proposed mechanism is that auxilin first binds to CCVs , and recruits ATP - bound Hsc70 proteins via its J - domain ( Ungewickell et al . , 1995 ; Holstein et al . , 1996 ) . The J - domain interaction then stimulates Hsc70 ATPase activity , thereby stabilizing the binding of Hsc70 to clathrin and driving triskelion dissociation ( Holstein et al . , 1996 ) . Consistent with this , inhibition of auxilin function in vivo causes an accumulation of CCVs , indicative of defects in clathrin uncoating ( Gall et al . , 2000 ; Pishvaee et al . , 2000 ; Greener et al . , 2001 ) . In addition to auxilin , receptor - mediated endocytosis ( Rme ) 8 , another J - domain – containing protein , was implicated in receptor - mediated internalization and fluid - phase tracer uptake in Caenorhabditis elegans ( Zhang et al . , 2001 ) , suggesting that distinct cochaperones may mediate di - verse functions of Hsc70 in endocytosis . However , a link be - tween Rme - 8 and Hsc70 has not been established , and the ex - act role or site of action of Rme - 8 remains poorly understood . To identify new factors regulating endocytosis , we have screened for mutants altering the rough eye phenotype caused by the overexpression of a dominant - negative shibire ( shi ) , the Drosophila homologue of dynamin ( van der Bliek and Mey - erowitz , 1991 ; Chang et al . , 2002 ) . Mutations in dynamin , a GTPase required for the detachment of CCVs from the plasma membrane , were first isolated as animals exhibiting temperature - sensitive paralysis , caused by a disruption in neu - rotransmitter recycling ( Poodry et al . , 1973 ; Poodry and Edgar , 1979 ) . Although the thermal sensitivity of shi has been used to identify other endocytic factors ( Narayanan and Ra - maswami , 2003 ) , we chose the developing eye for conducting a screen because the rough eye phenotype can detect modify - ing effects in gradation and is , therefore , more sensitive . Expression of shi K39A , a GTP hydrolysis – defective dy - namin , under the control of eye - specific GMR expression cassette has been shown to cause a rough eye phenotype ( Chang et al . , 2002 ) . Taking advantage of this , we have screened 30 , 000 progeny and identified several mutations in the Drosophila Rme - 8 gene . Here , we present evidence sug - gesting that Rme - 8 cooperates with Hsc70 - 4 and plays a role in regulating clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Results E ( shi ) 2 - 1 is a dominant modifier of a GTP hydrolysis – defective dynamin Expression of a GTP hydrolysis – defective dynamin , dyn K44A , was shown to block transferrin uptake in HeLa cells ( Damke et al . , 2001 ) . To test whether this putative dominant - negative dynamin mutant can block endocytosis in Drosophila cells , we expressed the fly dynamin homologue shi carrying analogous mutation ( shi K39A ) in eye imaginal discs using the GMR ex - pression cassette ( Hay et al . , 1994 ; Chang et al . , 2002 ) . The mutant eye discs were then stained with an mAb against Bride of sevenless ( Boss ; Cagan et al . , 1992 ) , and the number of clusters with internalized Boss proteins was counted . Boss en - codes the membrane ligand for the Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase , and is specifically expressed on the apical surface of R8 and internalized into neighboring Sevenless - expressing cells ( Cagan et al . , 1992 ) . In wild - type discs , 29 . 6 % of the clusters ( n (cid:1) 1 , 674 ) exhibited detectable levels of internalized Boss . In the presence of one copy of GMR - shi K39A , only 18 . 7 % of the clusters ( n (cid:1) 2 , 000 ) contained internalized Boss , and this number was further reduced to 16 . 7 % ( n (cid:1) 1 , 439 ) when two copies of GMR - shi K39A were expressed . These data suggested that , in fly cells , expression of this GTP hydrolysis – defective dynamin , as in mammalian cells , can dominantly inhibit Rme . In addition to decreasing the level of Boss internalization , GMR - shi K39A caused a rough eye phenotype ( Fig . 1 B ) , pre - sumably reflecting an alteration of one or more signaling processes due to the inhibition of endocytosis during eye de - velopment ( Chang et al . , 2002 ) . In contrast , expression of wild - type shi using the GMR promoter had no effect on eye morphology ( Fig . 1 A ) . As for the Boss internalization defect , the rough eye phenotype became more severe as flies carried more copies of the GMR - shi K39A transgene ( unpublished data ) . This sensitivity to gene dose suggested that we could use GMR - shi K39A to identify genes functioning in the dynamin - mediated pathway by isolating second - site mutations that modify ( either suppress or enhance ) the rough eye phenotype . Accordingly , we screened (cid:1) 30 , 000 x - ray mutagenized progeny for mutants that altered the rough eye phenotype of GMR - shi K39A ( see Materials and methods for details ) . We isolated 24 enhancers ( i . e . , those that made the eye pheno - type worse ) and 1 suppressor ( those that made the eye phe - notype better ) , which were assigned into 3 multi - hit and 4 single - hit complementation groups . Here , we describe our characterization of E ( shi ) 2 - 1 ( 17 alleles ) , which exhibited the strongest enhancer interaction with GMR - shi K39A among all our mutants ( Fig . 1 C ) . E ( shi ) 2 - 1 affects Rme during eye development The genetic interaction with GMR - shi K39A suggested that E ( shi ) 2 - 1 functions in the endocytic pathway . To test if this Figure 1 .

The localization of Boss proteins can be easily monitored using a functional HRP - Boss chimera in which the cytochemically detectable enzyme HRP was fused to the extracellular domain of Boss ( Sunio et al . , 1999 ) . In wild - type eye disc ( Fig . 2 A ) , the staining pattern of HRP - Boss fusion was seen as “patches , ” representing Boss proteins on the apical surface of R8 cells , and “dots , ” representing those accumulated in structures in Sevenless - expressing cells ( Su - nio et al . , 1999 ) . As shown in Fig . 2 B , the neighboring small dots of HRP - Boss were absent in homozygous E ( shi ) 2 - 1 mutant disc , indicating that the receptor - mediated internal - ization of Boss was inhibited . In addition to Boss internalization , E ( shi ) 2 - 1 was also re - quired for proper ommatidial development . A tangential section of mosaic adult retina showed that mutant clusters often lack complete complement of photoreceptor cells ( Fig . 2 C ) . In mosaic clusters with a normal complement of pho - toreceptors ( Fig . 2 C , circles ) , the size of rhabdomeres ( the light - sensing organelles ) in mutant cells was consistently smaller than those of the wild - type cells . Furthermore , the organization of regular ommatidial array in these mutant tis - sues was disrupted . E ( shi ) 2 - 1 inhibits tracer uptake at early steps of the endocytic pathway To further understand the role of E ( shi ) 2 - 1 in the endocytic pathway , we examined the defects in the uptake of an en - docytic tracer , Texas red – conjugated avidin ( TR - avidin ) , by homozygous E ( shi ) 2 - 1 mutant larval Garland cells . Garland cells are thought to function as nephrocytes and have a rapid rate of fluid - phase endocytosis ( Kosaka and Ikeda , 1983 ) . This internalization of TR - avidin by Garland cells appears to be clathrin dependent , as mutations in (cid:4) - adaptin , a subunit of the AP - 2 adaptor complex required for forming CCVs at the plasma membrane ( González - Gaitán and Jackle , 1997 ) , in - hibit this process ( Fig . S3 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200311084 / DC1 ) . Wild - type and mutant Garland cells were incubated in PBS with TR - avidin for 1 min at 25 (cid:5) C , washed , and then chased for various times ( Fig . 3 ; Videos 1 and 2 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200311084 / DC1 ) . To identify endocytic compartments , the cells also carried an Act5C - GAL4 / (cid:2) ; UAS - GFP - rab7 / (cid:2) transgene , which labels late endosomal and lysosomal structures ( Entchev et al . , 2000 ) . After the 1 - min incubation , in wild - type cells most of the TR - avidin was pe - ripherally localized in Rab7 - negative structures just beneath the plasma membrane ( Fig . 3 A , red ) . After a chase of 20 min at 25 (cid:5) C , the TR - avidin was transferred to more central regions of the cytoplasm where it was found associated with Rab7 - positive structures , suggesting that the tracer had reached late endosomes or lysosomes ( Fig . 3 B ) . In contrast , in E ( shi ) 2 - 1 / E ( shi ) 2 - 1 Garland cells , relatively little TR - avidin appeared to be internalized after a 1 - min incubation ( Fig . 3 D ) . Moreover , little if any of the tracer was transferred to Rab7 - positive structures after a 20 - min chase ( Fig . 3 E ) . To determine whether the small amount of staining seen in E ( shi ) 2 - 1 / E ( shi ) 2 - 1 cells represented TR - avidin adsorbed to the plasma membrane or trapped in peripheral intracel - lular vesicles , the uptake assay was modified so Garland cells without the GFP - rab7 transgene were incubated in TR - avidin for 1 min at 25 (cid:5) C , chased for 20 min at 25 (cid:5) C , and then incubated with FITC - avidin for 1 min at 4 (cid:5) C . The incubation of second tracer at 4 (cid:5) C allowed us to assess whether TR - avidin had been internalized into compart - ments inaccessible to outside because further endocytosis would have been inhibited by cold . In wild - type cells ( Fig . 3 C ) , although TR - avidin was seen as vesicular staining near the center , FITC - avidin staining was mostly peripheral near the cell membrane , indicating that TR - avidin has tran - sited to late endocytic compartments after 20 min . In con - trast , the staining of TR - and FITC - avidin showed exten - sive overlap in mutant cells ( Fig . 3 F , arrows ) , indicating that most of the TR - avidin associated with mutant cells was trapped at the plasma membrane or in structures accessible to outside . Although these results could not definitively dis - tinguish whether the tracers were never internalized , or were once internalized but recycled back to the plasma membrane due to a block in transit through endosomal Figure 2 .

Endosomal organization and clathrin distribution are disrupted in E ( shi ) 2 - 1 mutant cells Given that the uptake of the endocytic tracers into Rab7 - posi - tive late endosomes was strongly inhibited , we tested whether E ( shi ) 2 - 1 exhibited defects in endosomal organization by comparing the staining pattern of Hook ( Hk ) , a cytosolic pro - tein associated with early endosomes ( Kramer and Phistry , 1996 ) , and GFP - rab7 , in both wild - type and homozygous E ( shi ) 2 - 1 mutant tissues . In wild - type Garland cells , Hk was localized to the cell periphery and associated with structures that were distinct from the bulk of the Rab7 staining ( Fig . 4 A ) . In contrast , Hk staining was patchy and greatly reduced in homozygous E ( shi ) 2 - 1 Garland cells ( Fig . 4 B ) . In addition , Rab7 appeared more diffuse and centrally located in E ( shi ) 2 - 1 Garland cells ( Fig . 4 B ) . Although Rab7 - positive structures were still present in E ( shi ) 2 - 1 cells , their morphology and den - sity of Rab7 labeling varied considerably . A defect in Hk localization was also detected in mosaic eye imaginal discs generated by FLP / FRT recombination . To iden - tify the z - axis focal plane visualized for each cell cluster , the eye discs were also stained with an anti - Elav antibody , which labels Figure 3 .

In wild - type cells ( indicated by the presence of GFP expression ) , Hk was concentrated near the apical cortex of photoreceptor cells . In homozygous E ( shi ) 2 - 1 mutant cells ( indicated by the absence of GFP expression ) , the staining of Hk proteins ap - peared more vesicular , less restricted to the apical surface , and could be easily detected at lower focal planes of cells ( Fig . 4 C ) . Together , these data suggested that the organization of endo - somal compartments was affected by E ( shi ) 2 - 1 mutation . The genetic interaction with dynamin and the requirement for Boss internalization during eye development suggested that E ( shi ) 2 - 1 may play a role in a clathrin - mediated pathway . To determine whether E ( shi ) 2 - 1 has an effect on clathrin dis - tribution , we compared the localization of a clathrin light chain - EGFP ( Clc - EGFP ) in wild - type and mutant Garland cells ( Chang et al . , 2002 ) . This Clc - EGFP was placed under the control of UAS regulatory elements , and was expressed in Garland cells using the Act5C - GAL4 driver line . In wild - type cells , Clc - EGFP was seen as punctate staining around the cell periphery , presumably representing vesicular clathrin - coated structures ( Fig . 4 D ) . However , in homozygous E ( shi ) 2 - 1 cells , the Clc - EGFP staining was weaker and more diffuse , although clustering near the limiting membrane of some large internal structures was occasionally observed ( Fig . 4 E , arrows ) . This abnormal distribution of Clc - EGFP in mutant Garland cells suggested that clathrin function may be compromised by E ( shi ) 2 - 1 . Interestingly , the phenotype of clathrin mislocaliza - tion , as well as those defects in endosomal organization , were remarkably similar to those seen in cells deficient in Hsc70 - 4 , the Drosophila homologue of clathrin uncoating ATPase ( Fig . 4 F ; Chang et al . , 2002 ) , raising the possibility that E ( shi ) 2 - 1 and Hsc70 - 4 function in a common pathway . E ( shi ) 2 - 1 encodes fly homologue of Rme - 8 gene To identify the gene responsible for E ( shi ) 2 - 1 , the enhance - ment of the GMR - shi K39A rough eye was first mapped to 2 - 61 ( n (cid:1) 62 ) by meiotic recombination . The lethality as - sociated with E ( shi ) 2 - 1 was included in the deletion Df ( 2R ) G63 - 73 ( 45A13 - B1 ; 45D5 - 8 ) but excluded from Df ( 2R ) w73 - 3 ( 45B5 - 7 ; 45D5 - 8 ) , placing the gene in the cy - tological interval of 45A13 - B1 to B5 - 7 . The position of gene was further narrowed down to a region between two P - ele - ment lines , l ( 2 ) k04512 and l ( 2 ) k06021 ( Spradling et al . , 1995 , 1999 ) , using P - element – mediated male recombina - tion ( Chen et al . , 1998 ) . Although there are (cid:1) 13 transcriptional units between l ( 2 ) k04512 and l ( 2 ) k06021 , we decided to focus on large transcripts first because 17 alleles of E ( shi ) 2 - 1 were isolated from a relatively small screen , suggesting that the E ( shi ) 2 - 1 coding region is large . Indeed , sequencing analysis of E ( shi ) 2 - 1 l ( 2 ) 45Ba revealed that CG8014 ( Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project ; Rubin et al . , 2000 ) , the largest transcript in the region ( ORF (cid:1) 7 , 162 bp ) , contained a nonsense mutation at tryptophan 1287 ( Fig . 5 ) . Consistent with this interpretation , ubiquitous expression of CG8014 under the Act5C - GAL4 driver could revert the enhancement of the GMR - shi K39A rough eye phenotype by E ( shi ) 2 - 1 alleles , and could rescue the recessive lethality associated with E ( shi ) 2 - 1 ( unpublished data ) . Together , these observations indicate that CG8014 is the gene for E ( shi ) 2 - 1 . Expression profile analysis from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project indicated that CG8014 transcripts were detected ubiquitously throughout all stages of embryonic development , but enriched in Malpighian tubule and Garland cells ( Tomancak et al . , 2002 ) . CG8014 encodes a protein of 2 , 387 amino acids , most homologous to Rme - 8 , a gene previously identified in C . ele - gans for defects in Rme ( Zhang et al . , 2001 ) . Putative homo - logues were also found in Arabidopsis ( GenBank / EMBL / DDBJ accession no . NP _ 180257 ) , rice ( AAP55138 ) , rat ( XP _ 236584 ) , and human ( BK001645 ) , suggesting that the function of Rme - 8 is conserved ( Zhang et al . , 2001 ) . Al - though no obvious motif except an internal J - domain was Figure 5 . E ( shi ) 2 - 1 encodes Drosophila homologue of Rme - 8 .

The exons of Rme - 8 , flanked by Rab - RP1 and rad201 loci , are drawn to scale and shown by white boxes , and the directions of transcription units are indicated by arrows . To test if E ( shi ) 2 - 1 corresponds to CG8014 , we first generated lethal excision lines from p { w (cid:2) } BG02191 ( # 12659 ; Bloomington Drosophila stock center ) , a viable transposon line with a P - element inserted only 92 bp upstream of the CG8014 transcription initiation site . Of the 25 excisions recovered , three were lethal and all failed to complement all alleles of E ( shi ) 2 - 1 , suggesting that E ( shi ) 2 - 1 is CG8014 . This was further confirmed by the sequence analysis of the E ( shi ) 2 - 1 l ( 2 ) 45Ba allele , which revealed a premature stop codon before the J - domain in the Rme - 8 ORF . Below , a scaled - up diagram of Rme - 8 ORF to illustrate the locations of the J - domain ( blue box ) , the four IWN domains ( numbered green boxes ) , and several highly conserved stretches ( yellow boxes ) . To facilitate subsequent analysis of Rme - 8 localization , an mRFP ( red box ) was inserted immediately after the start codon to create a functional mRFP – Rme - 8 fusion . To test the importance of its J - domain , a segment , ( delineated by the dashed line ) including the J - and IWN2 domains , was deleted from Rme - 8 to generate mRFP - Rme - 8 (cid:6) J . on J u l y 11 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m 1060 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 164 , Number 7 , 2004 detected in Rme - 8 protein sequence , comparison of Rme - 8 sequences from divergent species revealed four previously defined IWN domains ( Zhang et al . , 2001 ) and several con - served regions ( Fig . 5 ) . The functions of these domains are not known ; however , the high degree of conservation does suggest that they are critical for Rme - 8 . Rme - 8 proteins are associated with multiple endocytic structures Although the C . elegans Rme - 8 proteins appeared to be asso - ciated with some multivesicular compartments , the identities of these structures were not established ( Zhang et al . , 2001 ) . To determine the subcellular localization of Rme - 8 proteins , we constructed UAS - mRFP - Rme - 8 FL , where a full - length Rme - 8 genomic / cDNA fusion is tagged at the NH 2 terminus with a monomeric RFP ( Campbell et al . , 2002 ; Fig . 5 ) . Ubiquitous expression of this construct could counter the en - hancement of the GMR - shi K39A rough eye phenotype by loss - of - function Rme - 8 mutations ( unpublished data ) , indicating that this mRFP - Rme - 8 FL was functional . To help in identifying subcellular structures , Act5C - GAL4 / (cid:2) ; UAS - mRFP - Rme - 8 FL / (cid:2) Garland cells also carried one copy of UAS - Clc - GFP , UAS - GFP - rab5 , or UAS - GFP - rab7 trans - gene ( Entchev et al . , 2000 ; Chang et al . , 2002 ; Wucherpfen - nig et al . , 2003 ) . Clc , Rab5 , and Rab7 are markers for clath - rin - positive organelles , early endosomes , and late endosomes , respectively . Although most of the Rme - 8 appeared to be cy - tosolic , accumulating beneath the plasma membrane , there were some spatial overlaps with clathrin - , Rab7 - , and Rab5 - positive structures ( Fig . 6 ) . Rme - 8 also exhibited some spatial overlaps with Hrs , a protein required for endosomal invagi - nation ( Lloyd et al . , 2002 ; Fig . S1 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200311084 / DC1 ) . These data suggested that Rme - 8 proteins were associated with mul - tiple endocytic compartments . Rme - 8 exhibits genetic interaction with Hsc70 Although the presence of a J - domain suggests that Rme - 8 might act as an accessory factor for Hsc70 , this possibility has not been addressed experimentally . To determine if the two proteins interact functionally in vivo , an ATP hydroly - sis – defective Hsc70 - 4 ( Hsc70 - 4 K71S ) was expressed in the eye discs using the GMR - GAL4 driver ( Elefant and Palter , 1999 ) . Expression of a mammalian Hsc70 carrying the analogous mutation in HeLa cells was shown to inhibit transferrin internalization and recycling , suggesting the mutant can interfere with the functions of endogenous wild - type Hsc70 ( Newmyer and Schmid , 2001 ) . Similarly , expression of Hsc70 - 4 K71S during eye development caused a disruption of the regular arrays of ommatidia and a Figure 6 .

Coexpression of mRFP - Rme - 8 FL using the GMR - GAL4 driver caused further om - matidial disorganization and a decrease in eye size ( Fig . 7 B ) , indicating that the rough eye phenotype of Hsc70 - 4 K71S was enhanced by Rme - 8 expression . Because overexpression of this functional mRFP - Rme - 8 FL alone has no obvious phenotype , this enhancement of Hsc70 - 4 K71S suggests that Rme - 8 genetically interacts with Hsc70 - 4 . Moreover , the directionality of this interaction suggests that Rme - 8 acts antagonistically with Hsc70 . To confirm that this genetic interaction is mediated by the J - domain , Rme - 8 with its internal J - domain deleted ( mRFP - Rme - 8 (cid:6) J ; Fig . 5 ) was coexpressed with Hsc70 - 4 K71S using a GMR - GAL4 driver ( Fig . S2 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200311084 / DC1 ) . In contrast to full - length Rme - 8 , expression of Rme - 8 (cid:6) J had little effect on the Hsc70 - 4 K71S phenotype ( Fig . 7 C ) , suggesting that the en - hancement by full - length Rme - 8 requires its J - domain . To demonstrate the specificity of this Rme - 8 – Hsc70 inter - action , we also coexpressed a full - length auxilin with Hsc70 - 4 K71S during eye development . Surprisingly , although the J - domain – containing auxilin has been shown to cooperate in Hsc70 - mediated uncoating of CCVs in vitro , its expression has little or no effect on the rough eye phenotype of Hsc70 - 4 K71S ( Fig . 7 D ) . This contrast in Hsc70 interaction between auxilin and Rme - 8 suggests that they are functionally dis - tinct . Conversely , an ATP hydrolysis – defective Hsc70 - 3 ( Hsc70 - 3 K97S ) was expressed in the eye discs using the GMR - GAL4 driver to test whether the enhancement by Rme - 8 was specific to Hsc70 - 4 . Hsc70 - 3 is the Drosophila homologue of BiP , an ER - associated Hsc70 required for translocation of newly synthesized membrane proteins ( Elefant and Palter , 1999 ) . Expression of this dominant - negative Hsc70 - 3 K97S during eye development caused a slight deformation and roughening of the eye ( Fig . 7 E ) . Coexpression of a full - length Rme - 8 using the GMR - GAL4 driver exhibited little or no effect on the Hsc70 - 3 K97S phenotype ( Fig . 7 F ) , sug - gesting that Rme - 8 cooperates with Hsc70 - 4 , but not other Hsc70 family proteins . The J - domain of Rme - 8 binds to Hsc70 in the presence of ADP in vitro To determine whether the J - domain of Rme - 8 can bind to Hsc70 directly , a peptide ( aa 1301 – 1368 ) containing the J - domain of the Drosophila Rme - 8 was fused to GST , and the resulting fusion , GST - J Rme - 8 , was subjected to a pull - down assay with bovine Hsc70 . It is generally thought that J - domains recruit ATP - bound Hsc70 ( Kelley , 1999 ) , thus the pull - down was performed in either the presence of ATP or ADP to see if the binding was nucleotide dependent . Sur - prisingly , although GST - J Rme - 8 exhibited the same level of binding as GST alone in the presence of ATP , GST - J Rme - 8 showed an elevated level of binding to bovine Hsc70 in the presence of ADP ( Fig . 8 ) . Thus , unlike the J - domain from auxilin , the J - domain of Rme - 8 appears to interact with ADP - bound Hsc70 . These data , along with the enhance - ment by Rme - 8 overexpression of the mutant rough eye phe - notype due to dominant - negative Hsc70 , suggest that the in - teraction of Rme - 8 with Hsc70 may be different from that of other J - domain – containing proteins . Discussion We have isolated mutations in the Drosophila Rme - 8 gene from a screen for mutants exhibiting interactions with a GTP hydrolysis – defective dynamin . Consistent with this genetic interaction , phenotypic analysis suggests that Rme - 8 is re - quired for the internalization of membrane ligands and en - docytic tracers .

In C . elegans coelomocytes , Rme - 8 proteins appeared to be associated with the membrane of some large multivesicu - lar endosomal structures , although the identity of these structures was unclear ( Zhang et al . , 2001 ) . In Drosophila Garland cells , the functional mRFP - tagged Rme - 8 proteins appeared to be associated with multiple endocytic organelles including clathrin - , Rab5 - , and Rab7 - positive structures . This , along with the abnormal Clc , Hk , and Rab7 staining exhibited by Rme - 8 mutants , might suggest that Rme - 8 has a role in organizing and / or maintaining endosomal compart - ments . Disrupting the integrity of these endosomal com - partments by Rme - 8 mutations may cause a depletion of the cytosolic clathrin pool , which leads to the apparent block in the uptake of endocytic tracers . Alternatively , Rme - 8 may have a more direct role at some early steps of endocytosis . The strong inhibition of tracer uptake and the genetic inter - action with dynamin exhibited by Rme - 8 mutants are cer - tainly consistent with this possibility . Still , the understand - ing of the mechanisms of Rme - 8 function would require the identification and characterization of its binding partners . In any case , it seems clear that Rme - 8 acts as an unex - pected cofactor specific for Hsc70 - 4 in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . First , the mutant phenotypes of Rme - 8 , such as defects in Boss internalization , uptake of endocytic tracers , endosomal organization , and clathrin distribution , are re - markably similar to those of Hsc70 - 4 ( Chang et al . , 2002 ) . Actually , the phenotypic resemblance appears to extend be - yond defects in endocytosis as homozygous Rme - 8 animals , like Hsc70 - 4 mutants , are developmentally delayed and of - ten contain melanotic masses ( unpublished data ) . However , the most compelling evidence is that Rme - 8 exhibited a J - domain – dependent genetic interaction with Hsc70 - 4 , but not with other members of Hsc70 family proteins . The in vitro pull - down assay further showed that the J - domain of Rme - 8 could bind to Hsc70 , suggesting that the Hsc70 – Rme - 8 interaction is likely to be direct . These data , along with the vast similarities in phenotypes exhibited by Rme - 8 and Hsc70 - 4 mutants , strongly argue that the internal J - do - main is critical for Rme - 8 to regulate Hsc70 function . The observation that overexpression of a functional Rme - 8 has an inhibitory effect on a dominant - negative Hsc70 suggests that Rme - 8 acts antagonistically to Hsc70 during endocytosis . This , along with the binding of the Rme - 8 J - domain to ADP - bound Hsc70 , suggests that Rme - 8 may act as an inhibitor of the Hsc70 ATPase cycle . One proposed mechanism for this dominant - negative be - havior of Hsc70 K71S is that the mutant protein fails to re - lease substrates upon ATP binding ( Elefant and Palter , 1999 ) . Thus , the GMR - Hsc70 K71S rough eye phenotype could be caused by the sequestration of limited substrates or effectors . Although the J - domain of Rme - 8 does not ap - pear to bind to ATP - bound Hsc70 , it is conceivable that overexpression of full - length Rme - 8 may interact with the endogenous wild - type ADP - bound Hsc70 and cause a fur - ther sequestration of relevant substrates , thereby enhancing the Hsc70 K71S eye phenotype . In any event , although Rme - 8 interacts with Hsc70 to reg - ulate clathrin - dependent endocytosis , several evidences sug - gest that Rme - 8 is not itself involved in clathrin uncoating . First , the strong endocytic phenotypes of Hsc70 R447H , a point mutation with a moderate reduction in uncoating activity , were recapitulated by Rme - 8 mutations , suggesting Rme - 8 mutations affected some Hsc70 - dependent processes distinct from uncoating . Consistent with this , inspection of the Rme - 8 sequence does not reveal any clathrin - binding sites ( Mor - gan et al . , 2000 ) . Furthermore , overexpression of auxilin and Rme - 8 exhibit different genetic interactions with Hsc70 . To - gether , these data suggest that Rme - 8 most likely participates in some novel processes in Hsc70 - mediated endocytosis . Thus , by establishing a link between Rme - 8 and Hsc70 , our data strongly suggest that the function of Hsc70 in endocyto - sis in vivo is more complex and probably not limited to clath - rin uncoating . Although a more extensive role for Hsc70 has been implied by the observation that a decrease in Hsc70 function caused multiple defects in the endocytic pathway , such as the recycling of transferrin ( Newmyer and Schmid , 2001 ; Chang et al . , 2002 ) , it has remained unclear whether the associated defects reflected distinct functions of Hsc70 as opposed to indirect consequences of a block in clathrin un - coating . Our identification of a second J - domain cochaper - one that is critical for endocytosis is certainly consistent with the pleiotropic effects of Hsc70 on the endocytic pathway . Conceivably , the interaction of the clathrin - binding protein auxilin with Hsc70 is selectively important for coated vesicle uncoating , and the Rme - 8 – dependent function of Hsc70 might control a downstream step . In either event , the identi - fication of Rme - 8 as a second cofactor for Hsc70 in endocy - tosis should provide a framework for further understanding the diverse functions of Hsc70 in this process . Materials and methods Fly genetics All fly crosses were performed at 25 (cid:5) C in standard laboratory conditions . For the GMR - shi K39A modifier screen , w ; iso 2 ; 3 males were mutagenized with 4 , 000 rad of x - ray irradiation , and were mass mated with w / w ; TM3 , Sb , P { w (cid:2) , GMR - shi K39A } - 3 / e , ftz . ry virgins . Progeny exhibiting altered GMR - shi K39A eye phenotype were individually backcrossed to w / w ; TM3 , Sb , P { w (cid:2) , GMR - shi K39A } - 3 / e , ftz . ry flies to ensure the phenotype bred true . Based on the segregation of GMR - shi K39A modifying phenotype , the puta - tive mutants were then maintained over appropriate balancers , and were grouped by complementation tests . All of our Rme - 8 alleles appear to be recessive embryonic lethal . How - ever , mutant animals trans - heterozygous for certain allelic combinations , such as Rme - 8 A9 / Rme - 8 C19 , do reach larval stages as rare escapers , allow - ing isolation of mutant eye discs and larval Garland cells for the HRP - Boss and tracer uptake analysis . For the tangential section of adult retina , mitotic mutant clones were generated by heat - shocking progeny from crosses between w ; FRT neo 42D , Rme - 8 A9 males and hs - FLP1 ; FRT neo 42D , P { w (cid:2) } 47A females ( Xu and Rubin , 1993 ) . Mitotic clones in larval eye discs were generated using ey - FLP ; FRT42D neo , GMR - myrGFP - 2R ( Chang et al . , 2002 ) . To facilitate exogenous protein expression in larval Garland cells , UAS - derived transgenes ( UAS - mRFP - Rme - 8 , UAS - GFP - rab5 , UAS - GFP - rab7 , and UAS - GFP - Clc ) were driven with Act5C - GAL4 ( # 4414 ; Bloomington Drosophila stock center ) . For the Rme - 8 – Hsc70 interaction tests , UAS - Hsc70 - 4 K71S and UAS - Hsc70 - 3 K97S ( Elefant and Palter , 1999 ) were ex - pressed during eye development by GMR - GAL4 . UAS - GFP - rab5 and UAS - GFP - rab7 flies were obtained from M . A . González - Gaitán ( Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics , Dresden , Ger - many ) . UAS - Hsc70 - 4 K71S , UAS - Hsc70 - 3 K97S , and GMR - GAL4 were ob - tained from the Bloomington Drosophila stock center . on J u l y 11 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Rme - 8 interacts with Hsc70 in endocytosis | Chang et al . 1063 Genetic mapping of Rme - 8 To clone E ( shi ) 2 - 1 , the mutation was first placed in the cytological interval of 45B1 to B7 between two P - element lines , l ( 2 ) k04512 ( # 10544 ; Bloom - ington Drosophila stock center ) and l ( 2 ) k06021 ( Bloomington Drosophila stock center ; see text for details ) . This region has been subjected to an ex - tensive F 2 genetic analysis ( Dockendorff et al . , 2000 ) , and complementa - tion tests showed that E ( shi ) 2 - 1 is allelic with l ( 2 ) 45Ba . Consistent with this , l ( 2 ) 45Ba also exhibited a strong interaction with GMR - shi K39A . Of all the transcription units in the region between l ( 2 ) k04512 and l ( 2 ) k06021 , CG8014 is the largest one . To test if E ( shi ) 2 - 1 corresponds to CG8014 , we first generated lethal excision lines from p { w (cid:2) } BG02191 ( # 12659 ; Bloomington Drosophila stock center ) , a viable transposon line with a P - element inserted only 92 bp upstream of CG8014 transcription initiation site . Of the 25 excisions recovered , three were lethal , suggesting that the CG8014 locus might have been disrupted . All three lethal excision lines exhibited strong interaction with GMR - shi K39A and failed to comple - ment all alleles of E ( shi ) 2 - 1 , suggesting that E ( shi ) 2 - 1 is CG8014 . To con - firm this was indeed the case , exons of CG8014 locus were amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of E ( shi ) 2 - 1 l ( 2 ) 45Ba / (cid:2) heterozygous animals , and were subjected to sequence analysis . Histology and immunohistochemistry For the visualization of HRP - Boss , eye discs dissected from third instar lar - vae were stained in PBS containing 0 . 5 mg / ml DAB and 0 . 003 % H 2 O 2 for 30 min at RT ( Sunio et al . , 1999 ) . The discs were then washed twice with PBS and fixed in 2 % glutaraldehyde / PBS for 40 min at 4 (cid:5) C . After two washes with PBS , the discs were mounted in 80 % glycerol / PBS . For the endocytic tracer uptake assay , dissected Garland cells were in - cubated in PBS containing 0 . 2 mg / ml TR - avidin ( A - 821 ; Molecular Probes , Inc . ) for 1 min at 25 (cid:5) C . The cells were then washed with PBS , chased , and fixed with 4 % PFA / PBS for 20 min at 4 (cid:5) C . For the double - endocytic tracer uptake assay , dissected Garland cells were incubated in PBS containing 0 . 2 mg / ml TR - avidin for 1 min at 25 (cid:5) C . Then , the cells were washed with PBS , chased for 20 min , and chilled on ice . Finally , they were incubated in PBS containing 0 . 2 mg / ml FITC - conju - gated avidin ( A - 820 ; Molecular Probes , Inc . ) for 1 min at 4 (cid:5) C , washed with ice - cold PBS , and fixed with 4 % PFA / PBS for 20 min at 4 (cid:5) C . Immunostaining of eye discs and Garland cells was performed accord - ing to Wolff ( 2000 ) . Rabbit polyclonal anti - Hk antibody ( a gift from H . Kramer , University of Texas Southwestern , Dallas , TX ) was used at 1 : 500 dilution ( Kramer and Phistry , 1996 ) , and rat anti - Elav antibody ( Develop - mental Studies Hybridoma Bank , Iowa City , IA ) was used at 1 : 100 dilution . All confocal microscopy was performed using a microscope ( Axiovert S100 - TV ; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . ) with a confocal system ( MRC 1024 ; Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . Scanning EM Scanning EM was performed as described previously ( Wolff , 2000 ) . In brief , the eyes were fixed and dehydrated through a graded ethanol series ( 25 , 50 , 75 , and 2 (cid:7) 100 % ) . The samples were then incubated in hexa - methyldisilazane ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , dried under vacuum overnight , mounted on stubs , and imaged with a scanning electron microscope ( model SS40 ; International Scientific Instruments ) . Molecular biology Because of its relatively large size , no complete Drosophila Rme - 8 cDNA was available from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project EST collec - tion , as LD15941 , the longest EST clone of Rme - 8 , covered only the COOH - terminal 3 . 2 kb . To construct a full - length Rme - 8 transcription unit , three fragments corresponding to the NH 2 - terminal , central , and COOH - terminal regions of Rme - 8 were individually amplified by PCR and sequen - tially subcloned into pBlueScript ® SK ( pBSSK ; Strategene ) . First , an mRFP ORF without the stop codon was PCR amplified from pRSETB - mRFP1 ( Campbell et al . , 2002 ) using 5 (cid:8) - GCGAATTCATGGCCTCCTCCGAG - GACGTC - 3 (cid:8) and 5 (cid:8) - GCATCGATGGCGCCGGTGGAGTGGCGGC - 3 (cid:8) , and subcloned as an EcoRI – ClaI fragment into pHFK to make pHFK - mRFP - RC . The NH 2 - terminal portion of Rme - 8 was generated by PCR from genomic DNA using 5 (cid:8) - GCCATCGATCTGCCGCCTAAGGAAAACG - 3 (cid:8) and 5 (cid:8) - GCACTCTAGAATGGTTACATTACCAC - 3 (cid:8) , and subcloned in frame as a 2 . 6 - kb ClaI – XbaI fragment into pHFK - mRFP - RC . This mRFP - Rme - 8 NH 2 terminus fusion was then excised as a NotI – XbaI fragment and subcloned into pBSSK to make pBSSK - mRFP - Rme - 8 1st . Next , the central portion of Rme - 8 was amplified from genomic DNA using 5 (cid:8) - GACAACCCATGTGG - TAATGTAAC - 3 (cid:8) and 5 (cid:8) - GATGCCGTTCGCTGCTGCTCGAGG - 3 (cid:8) , and sub - cloned into pBSSK - mRFP - Rme - 8 1st as an XbaI – XhoI fragment to make pB - SSK - mRFP - Rme - 8 1st (cid:2) 2nd . Finally , the COOH - terminal portion of Rme - 8 was amplified from LD15941 using 5 (cid:8) - CGCGCTCAGCTTAAGGATTTC - 3 (cid:8) and 5 (cid:8) - GCGCTCGAGCGGCCGCTACGCTTTGCGCAGGACCCGC - 3 (cid:8) to engi - neer a NotI site after the stop codon , but before the XhoI site . The resulting 1 . 9 - kb PCR products were subcloned as an XhoI fragment into pBSSK - mRFP - Rme - 8 1st (cid:2) 2nd to complete the construction ( pBSSK - mRFP - Rme - 8 FL ) . The entire transcription unit was then verified by direct sequencing , and subcloned as a NotI fragment into pUAST expression vector ( Brand and Perrimon , 1993 ) . To make the J - domain deletion derivative , a BspEI frag - ment ( corresponding to aa 1114 – 1385 ) was excised from the central XbaI – XhoI fragment before being subcloned into pBSSK - mRFP - Rme - 8 1st . To construct pGMR - auxilin , a DNA fragment containing the entire aux - ilin ( CG1107 ) ORF was excised from GH26573 ( Research Genetics ) as an EcoRI – XhoI fragment with the XhoI end blunted , and subcloned into the EcoRI – HpaI sites of pGMR ( Hay et al . , 1994 ) . Transgenic flies carrying these constructs were generated by P - element – mediated transformation as described previously ( Rubin and Spradling , 1982 ) . To construct GST - J Rme - 8 , a DNA fragment containing the J - domain was generated by PCR using primers 5 (cid:8) - GAATTCGCTTACCAGGACCTAGGG - 3 (cid:8) and 5 (cid:8) - CTCGAGGGGATCTGGCCCACCCGAGCTCC - 3 (cid:8) . The resulting product was subcloned as an EcoRI – XhoI fragment into pGEX - 6P . Rme - 8 J - domain pull - downs In a total volume of 20 (cid:3) l , 4 (cid:3) M GST - J aux was incubated for 15 min at 25 (cid:5) C with 4 (cid:3) M Hsc70 protein and 2 mM nucleotide in uncoating buffer con - taining 0 . 1 % ovalbumin and 125 mM KCl . The binding reaction was trans - ferred to 4 (cid:5) C and incubated with 20 (cid:3) l GSH - Sepharose ( 50 % slurry ) with shaking for 30 min . The beads were collected by centrifugation at 16 , 000 g and washed twice with ice - cold buffer containing the appropriate nucle - otide ( 0 . 1 mM ) . The bound material was then analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Online supplemental material Fig .
