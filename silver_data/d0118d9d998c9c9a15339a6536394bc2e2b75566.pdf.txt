We report a study of the coordination activities and project outcomes of 491 research collaborations funded by the US National Science Foundation . Coordination activities , especially division of responsibility for tasks and knowledge transfer among investigators , predicted project outcomes ( e . g . , producing new knowledge , creating new tools , and training students ) . However , more universities involved in a collaboration predicted fewer coordination activities and fewer project outcomes . A statistical mediation analysis showed that insufﬁcient coordination explained the negative relationship between multi - university collaboration and project outcomes . © 2007 Elsevier B . V .

R & D labs are spread across continents ( Gassmann and von Zedtwitz , 1999 ) , open source software projects have contributors from around the world ( von Krogh and von Hippel , 2003 ) , and scientiﬁc collaborations involve many institutions ( Corley et al . , 2006 ) . Historians of sci - ence have traced the ﬁrst surge in distributed research projects to the shift after World War II from little science to big science , whereby scientists collaborated to lever - agethecostofexpensivescientiﬁcequipmentandtrained ∗ Corresponding author .

Withthe advent of computer networking , scientists across insti - tutions began to share data and networked instruments . The development of “collaboratories” allowed scien - tists in different geographic locations to share common resources ( Kouzes et al . , 1996 ) . European , Asian , and US funding agencies such as the Department of Energy sponsoredlarge - scaleprojectsbringingresearchersfrom different institutions together physically and virtually ( Finholt , 2002 ) . Recentpolicychangeshaveencouragedscientistsand engineers to form multiple - university collaborations in manyﬁelds ( KatzandMartin , 1997 ) . TheEUframework program promotes collaboration across universities and businesses to help build new technologies and to estab - lish connections among researchers in different member countries ( Luukkonen , 1998 ) .

Kiesler / Research Policy 36 ( 2007 ) 1620 – 1634 1621 researchsuchasKnowledgeandDistributedIntelligence ( KDI ) and Information Technology Research ( ITR ) . Large programs supported by the National Institutes of Health , such as the Human Genome Project ( Collins et al . , 1998 ) and AIDS research ( Teasley and Wolinsky , 2001 ) , also encourage research across disciplines and institutions . We argue that despite the advantages of shared resources and expertise , as well as increased incentives through additional funding for multi - university work , research collaborations involving multiple universities impose signiﬁcantly higher coordination costs than do single university projects . These coordination costs have institutional and geographic origins . In multi - university collaborations , for example , participating universities often have dissimilar institutional structures such as dif - ferent pay scales for staff and graduate students and distinct requirements for joint appointments or student transfers . Other institutional differences are rooted in culture and norms . For instance , researchers may have to negotiate where to publish because of differing “A - list” journals and conferences where faculty members seeking tenure are expected to publish . Geography also increases the coordination costs for multi - university collaborations . Geographical distance can slow group communication and consensus making , and a problem at onelocationmaygounnoticedbyresearchersattheotheruniversities . The higher coordination costs of collabo - rating across universities are likely to complicate both disciplinary and multi - disciplinary research , potentially affecting the success of these collaborations ( Cummings and Kiesler , 2005 ) . In this paper we examine project outcomes in sin - gle and multiple university research collaborations , and link coordination activities in these projects to their out - comes . Our arguments draw from organization theory on the knowledge - based view ( e . g . , Grant , 1996a ; Kogut and Zander , 1992 ) and recent theoretical and empirical research on coordination in distributed work ( e . g . , Boh et al . , 2007 ; Gibson and Gibbs , 2006 ; Hinds and Kiesler , 2002 ) . We report a study in which we measured coor - dination activities and project outcomes in 491 research collaborations , over half of which had investigators at morethanoneuniversity . Ourﬁndingssuggestthatcoor - dination costs are a signiﬁcant barrier to project success in multi - university collaborations . 1 . 1 . Knowledge - based view applied to research collaborations The goals of research collaborations are to achieve outcomes that include producing new knowledge , creating new research tools , training and educating stu - dents , and forming partnerships with institutions in the larger society , such as government agencies , muse - ums , or schools . To achieve these goals , scientiﬁc policy increasingly encourages research collaboration across disciplines and institutions ( Jeffrey , 2003 ) . The US National Academy of Sciences has reported that important accomplishments , including discoveries in nanotechnology , bioinformatics , and neuroscience , have been achieved through research collaboration ( National Academies , 1994 ) . Research collaboration provides a mechanism for investigators with differing advanced training and skills to work together on projects that they could not do on their own . The involvement of multiple investigators can decrease the variability in output qual - ity through feedback and the peer review of ideas ( Rigby and Edler , 2005 ) . A body of organizational theory , called the knowledge - based view , provides a theoretical frame - work for thinking about the value of research collab - orations that span multiple universities . The knowledge - based view originally came out of economic analyses of the so - called grow versus buy decisions by ﬁrms , that is , whether to develop resources within the organization or acquire these assets from external sources . Kogut and Zander ( 1992 ) and Grant ( 1996a , b ) argued that special - ized expertise embedded in people is the most important asset for organizations engaged in knowledge - intensive work . To innovate and gain competitive advantage , the organizationmayneedtodrawfromapoolofmanykindsofexpertise . Applied to university research , for instance , a research endeavor may require various medical scien - tists , computerscientists , andneuroscientists . According to the knowledge - based view , growing specialized areas of expertise within a single university would be best advised when each form of expertise will be used fre - quently and is unlikely to be appropriated ( copied ) by others . Alternatively , a temporary alliance with other universities would be best advised when the area of expertise is expensive to develop internally , is not likely to be used frequently , or could be appropriated easily by other organizations . Thus , the knowledge - based view implies that collaboration in multi - university projects is not inherently superior to within - university projects but rather is best justiﬁed for bringing together infrequently used and unique forms of expertise . 1 . 2 . Coordination in research collaborations From the perspective of the knowledge - based view , organizationsandprojectteamswithinorganizationsthat are more effective at integrating their diverse expertise 1622 J . N . Cummings , S . Kiesler / Research Policy 36 ( 2007 ) 1620 – 1634 will be more successful ( Grant , 1996a , b ) . Integrating diverse expertise for research requires creating a com - mon language and shared meaning within the research team , and managing the dependencies of tasks and link - ing different pieces together into a collective whole ( Malone and Crowston , 1994 ; Van de Ven et al . , 1976 ) . Organizationtheoristshavedistinguishedamongsev - eral types of coordination activities that help project teams integrate and best utilize their expertise . One type involves dividing and assigning responsibilities for tasks to appropriate specialists . Tasks whose leadership is assigned to different individuals or groups may be loosely coupled and thus resistant to over - dependency and communication failures ( Weick , 1979 ) . Porac et al . ( 2004 ) describedascientiﬁcallianceacrossmultipleuni - versities , in which the loose coupling of investigators contributed to improved productivity due to lower costs of direct communication . A second type of coordination activity involves sharing resources such as a common website or intranet , a shared database , or shared remote instruments . Leveraging common resources not only reduces the costs of data and communication for each investigator but also can lead to improved , systematic methods and standardized measurements . A third type of coordination activity involves learning and transfer - ring knowledge for potentially synergistic effects , such as through student exchanges and co - authoring papers . Deeply involving investigators and graduate students in co - authored papers , seminars , experiments , and other goal - driven intellectual efforts can lead to higher levels of cooperation and improved project achievement . A fourth and likely the most common type of coor - dination is direct communication through meetings and spontaneousdiscussion . Researchersinmanyﬁeldshold regular lab meetings , meet with graduate students , and discuss their work at conferences and seminars . In col - laborationsacrossinstitutions , theymaytraveltoseeone another or take sabbaticals at one another’s institution . More frequent communication is associated with greater trust , respect , and participatory norms . Disciplines such as particle physics have beneﬁted from norms of partic - ipatory processes ( Chompalov et al . , 2002 ) . 1 . 3 . Coordination costs in multi - university collaborations Coordination activities such as those described above are essential to research but they create costs that need to be taken into account when evaluating the effective - ness of collaborations . When multiple universities are involved in a project , complexity increases and the dif - ﬁculty of coordination activities increases ( Hagstrom , 1964 ; Hobday , 2000 ) . Distance reduces opportunities for spontaneous , informal talk in a shared social set - ting ( Kiesler and Cummings , 2002 ) . Compared with single university projects , projects with investigators at different universities are likely to have more difﬁculty fostering a collegial social environment ( Kraut et al . , 2002 ; Nardi and Whittaker , 2002 ) , building common ground ( Clark and Brennan , 1991 ) , maintaining aware - ness of what others are doing ( Weisband , 2002 ) , and makingrapidadjustmentstosurprises ( OlsonandOlson , 2000 ) . Allen’s ( 1977 ) rule of thumb is that co - workers shouldbenomorethan30mapart , beyondwhichcollab - oration effectiveness declines precipitously ( see Kraut et al . , 1990 ) . Advances in communication and computer tech - nology represent opportunities to collaborate in new ways , but for purposes of coordination , technology is an imperfect substitute for collocation . In studies of business and research projects with dispersed members , researchers have discovered project delays ( Espinosa andCarmel , 2004 ; Herbslebetal . , 2000 ) , misunderstand - ings ( Cramton , 2001 ) , institutional rivalries ( Armstrong and Cole , 2002 ) , free riding ( Weisband , 2002 ) , dis - tractions from local institutional priorities ( Mark et al . , 1999 ) , inconsistentproceduresacrossinstitutions ( Curtis et al . , 1988 ) , and failures to share information and com - municateeffectively ( HindsandMortensen , 2005 ; Hoegl and Proserpio , 2004 ) . If the project involves a greater percentage of members at different institutions , coordi - nation is more difﬁcult ( Cummings and Kiesler , 2005 ; Mark , 2005 ) . To summarize , we argue that coordination activi - ties are essential to integrating and utilizing expertise in research projects . Multi - university projects , however , impose greater costs and barriers to coordination that can have negative implications for the outcomes of these projects . Thus we hypothesize : Hypothesis 1 . The more coordination activities in a research project , the better the project outcomes . Hypothesis 2 . The more universities that are involved in a research project , the fewer the coordination activi - ties . Hypothesis 3 . The more universities that are involved in a research project , the worse the project outcomes . Hypothesis 4 . Insufﬁcient coordination activities will explain the negative association between number of universities involved in a research project and project outcomes ( statistical mediation ) . J . N .

Sample and data collection This study examined the coordination activities and outcomesofprojectsfundedbytheInformationTechnol - ogy Research ( ITR ) Program in the US National Science Foundation ( NSF ) . The ITR was a 5 - year NSF - wide pri - ority area for supporting interdisciplinary Information Technology ( IT ) research and education with innova - tive research and education projects . The program was a major NSF initiative , growing from US $ 90M in 2000 to US $ 295M in 2004 . Three kinds of awards were reviewed by separate peer review panels : Small projects ( up to US $ 500K for 3 years ) , Medium projects ( up to US $ 1M per year for 5 years ) , and Large projects ( up to US $ 3M per year for 5 years ) . This study exam - ined Medium and Large ITR projects awarded in the ﬁrst 4 years of the program , 2000 – 2004 . Because there was substantial overlap in the actual number of senior researchers and project funding for medium and large ITR projects , we combine them into a single analysis reported below . The typical project involved ﬁve princi - pal investigators ( PIs ) and two universities . The ITR program evolved over the period we studied in several ways . For FY 2000 , the ITR empha - sized fundamental information technology research and education , in 2001 , the application of informa - tion technology to science and engineering , in 2002 , multidisciplinary information technology , in 2003 , the relationship between acquisition and utilization of knowledge and information technology tools , and in 2004 , information technology research for national pri - orities . Administrative changes also took place in the programoverthe5years . Forexample , inlateryearsNSF imposed increasing proposal submission limits , and in 2004 it required coordination plans and limited submis - sions to one proposal per PI . At the start , most projects receivedmajorfundingfromtheComputerandInforma - tion Sciences and Engineering Directorate ( CISE ) , but awards distributed across the National Science Founda - tion increased over the years . Over 70 % of the projects involved two or more disciplines , although roughly 50 % of senior researchers were from computer science , with the remaining senior researchers coming from engineer - ing , physical sciences , and other sciences . The ITR program offered researchers opportunities to form new collaborations and projects , which made it extraordinarily popular in information technology communities around the US . The number of proposals increased from approximately 2100 proposals in 2000 for the ﬁrst year of the program to over 3100 proposals in 2004 . Even with increased ITR funds , the program became more competitive . In 2000 , 30 % of the medium andlargeproposalswerefunded ; in2001and2002 , 27 % ; in 2003 , 24 % ; in 2004 , 21 % . At the same time , awarded project budgets were reduced more in the latter years of the program . In our dataset of 549 large and medium ITR projects , year 2000 projects received 76 % of their proposalbudget ; year2001received68 % ; year2002and 2003 received 50 % ; year 2004 received 49 % . In the spring of 2004 , NSF asked the authors to orga - nize a workshop of research grantees to assess what had happened in the ITR research projects , following a pro - cedure created to assess the previous Knowledge and Distributed Intelligence ( KDI ) program ( see Cummings and Kiesler , 2005 ) . NSF invited the principal investiga - tor ( PI ) and a co - PI from each of the Medium and Large projects to the workshop ( a total of 379 PIs and co - PIs attended along with 37 NSF ofﬁcers ) . At this workshop weaskedresearchers , organizedintosmallgroups , todis - cuss with one another how their research projects were organizedandmanaged , thekindsofoutcomestheygen - erated , and the ways in which their experience could inform future program evaluation . From the workshop notes and documentation from ITRprojectwebsitesandreports , wecreatedaweb - based online survey to systematically assess the coordination activities and project outcomes that workshop partic - ipants had described in connection with their own projects . We created items that represented the most fre - quent coordination activities and project outcomes men - tioned in the workshop and in the former survey of the KDIprogram . InMayandJuneof2005 , wesurveyedone PI per university represented on each project , avoiding duplication so that any one person completed only one survey for one project . Each university involved in a col - laboration was sampled . For example , on a project with threeuniversities , wesurveyedthemostseniorPIateach university , and averaged the responses to obtain project - level measures . There were 2692 PIs for 549 projects , andtoavoidduplicatesurveyswerequestedsurveysfromonly1302ofthem ( 48 % ) . We received responses from 885 of those sent a survey , for an overall response rate of 68 % . Due to missing data from some projects , the analyses here cover 491 of the 549 projects ( 89 % ) . 2 . 2 . Measures We obtained descriptive data on each project , such as its start date , budget , senior researchers , and univer - sities from the NSF . We used self - reports on the survey and information available on the web to classify each senior researcher’s discipline . ITR project investigators 1624 J . N . Cummings , S . Kiesler / Research Policy 36 ( 2007 ) 1620 – 1634 whoparticipatedintheonlineassessmentprovidedinfor - mation on project participants , coordination activities , and project outcomes to date . We used self - reported out - comes , such as whether they published or not , rather than citation counts , because of the recent nature of the projects . From individual items , we created composites of checkbox items in the online survey . For instance , to measure knowledge outcomes , we listed seven possible speciﬁc outcomes related to gains in new knowledge . Groupings of items were decided based on deﬁnitions from the Government Performance Results Act ( GPRA ) of 1993 , as deﬁned by NSF , and factor analyses from a previous study of the National Science Foundation KDI program ( Cummings and Kiesler , 2005 ) . We also added two other outcome measures regarding the sustainability of the collaborations .

Analysis strategy The analyses we report in this article are at the project level ( i . e . , a research collaboration ) . The survey data for each project were averaged across senior researchers who responded to the survey . Variables used are shown in Table 1 . The coordination activities and outcome vari - ablesarecompositevariables : sumsofspeciﬁcbehaviors in a category such as holding a workshop in the case of the knowledge transfer coordination activities , and sums of speciﬁc outcomes such as applying for a patent in the case of knowledge outcomes . Becauseourfocusisonthelinkbetweencoordination activitiesandprojectoutcomes , ouranalysisstrategyﬁrst involved assessing the direct effects of control variables and the impact of coordination activities on project out - comes ( H1 ) . Nextweexaminedtheindependentvariable ofnumberofuniversitiesoncoordinationactivities ( H2 ) . The third step was to assess how the number of univer - sities in a project was related to the project’s outcomes ( H3 ) . The fourth step was to perform a mediation anal - ysis to test whether coordination activities explained , or mediated , the negative effects of multiple universities on project outcomes ( H4 ) . Generally a variable is said to function as a mediator to the extent that it accounts for the relationship between an independent variable and the dependent variable ( Baron and Kenny , 1986 ) . In the current analysis , the aim is to identify the coordination activities that might explain why more universities involved in a project predicted fewer positive project outcomes . 3 . Results We conducted preliminary descriptive analyses to examine the distributions of the variables and the raw correlations of variables with one another . Projects with an earlier start date reported more outcomes , which is to be expected because more time had passed for achiev - ing project outcomes . We also found a curvilinear effect of start date with outcomes because investigators whose projects started in 2000 , the ﬁrst year of the ITR pro - gram , reported fewer outcomes relative to those in later years . To control for these effects , our regression results are modeled using the linear and quadratic start dates as control variables . We also examined whether project budgets and the number of senior researchers ( measures of the size of projects ) were associated with each other and with coordination activities and project outcomes . Overall , budgets were associated with both coordination activ - ities and project outcomes . Researchers with smaller budgets did less coordination and also achieved fewer outcomes . Budget and number of senior investigators were subsequently included in all regressions as controls . We also included as a control variable the R & D expenditures of the universities involved in each project to serve as a proxy measure of the experience and resources of the participating universities . In our sample , the number of different univer - sities involved in a project ranged from 1 to 13 , and the number of disciplines of the PIs and senior researchersrangedfrom1to5 . Thenumberofdisciplines increased with the number of universities ( r = 0 . 29 ) . This correlation supports the idea that one reason for multi - university collaborations may be to assemble a combination of expertise in disciplines that is not avail - able locally . In all of our subsequent analyses , the number of disciplines in a project was used as a control variable . 3 . 1 . Effects of coordination activities on project outcomes ( H1 ) We argued that to be successful , research projects must engage in coordination activities . Table 2 presents the direct associations between coordination activities and project outcomes of the 491 ITR projects in our sample . Thelevelsofthesecorrelationsaresmalltomod - erate , buttheyareallpositiveandstatisticallysigniﬁcant . We then ran regressions testing the impact of each coor - dination activity on the composite outcome variables , withcontrolsaslistedinTable1 . Theresultsareshownin Table3 .

The regressions identify speciﬁc coordination activities that were most highly predictive of project out - comes .

In Table 5 , bigger projects and thosewithmoredisciplinestendedtofostermorecoordi - nation , butcontrollingforthosetrends , moreuniversities in a research project predicted fewer coordination activ - ities in the categories of division of responsibility , knowledge transfer , and meetings ( H2 ) . In Table 6 , more universities predicted signiﬁcantly fewer outcomes in four of the six measured categories—knowledge , tools , training , and leverage ( H3 ) . We display the predicted project outcomes in Fig . 1 to illustrate the direction of the effects . 3 . 3 . Do coordination activities explain the negative impact of more universities on project outcomes ( H4 ) ? To test whether insufﬁcient coordination explained the negative effects of more universities on project out - comes , we conducted a statistical mediation analysis . To do this , we compared the models in Table 6 with and without coordination activities in these models . If coor - dination mediates the association of more universities with negative project outcomes , then coordination activ - ities would be signiﬁcant effects in the models and at the same time we would see a reduced statistical effect of number of universities on outcomes . Mediation is shown if the coordination activities variables substitute for the independent variable ( number of universities ) , in explaining variation in the dependent variable ( project outcomes ) .

Instead , we see the effects of coordination activities predicting variance in outcomes . We performed Sobel tests ( MacKinnon et al . , 1995 ) to test the effect of each coordination activity , controlling for the others . We found two coor - dination activity categories to be signiﬁcant mediators by these tests . First , division of responsibilities ( such as subgroups assigned to work on tasks , faculty and post - doc supervised tasks ) mediated effects on knowl - edge , tools , and training outcomes . Second , knowledge transfer ( such as student exchanges , co - authorship , and presentations ) mediated knowledge , tools , training , and leverageoutcomes , andwasthemostconsistentlyimpor - tant coordination activity category .

Discussion Wefoundsupportforourhypothesesthathavingmul - tiple universities involved in a research collaboration complicates coordination and reduces outcomes in the project . Our empirical analyses reﬁne these arguments . The results especially bear on the outcomes of new knowledge , tools , training , and leverage for additional research , and the importance of division of responsibil - ity and knowledge transfer activities in achieving those outcomes . These relationships were found even when controlling for other characteristics of projects , such as project duration and size , which also predict out - comes . Because our study was a one - time survey of ongo - ingcollaborationssupportedbyasingleinterdisciplinaryinitiativerelatedtoinformationtechnologyandothersciences , we cannot say whether our ﬁndings have gen - eralizability to other ﬁelds or programs of research . Our results also do not provide evidence of a speciﬁc causal relationship between coordination activities and project outcomes . Indeed , we did not ﬁnd any statistical moderation effects ( interactions between coordination activities and number of universities ) indicating that a greater effort to implement coordination would reduce thenegativemulti - universityeffects . Lackofmoderation suggests that coordination activities reﬂect something more fundamental about multi - university projects that 1630 J . N . Cummings , S .

Weevaluatetwopossiblealternativeexplanationsforourﬁndingsbelow : selection bias and lack of collaboration experience . First , it is possible that selection bias caused the multi - universityeffectsweobserved . Thatis , perhapsthe researchofthemulti - universityproposalsintheITRpro - gram was not as exemplary at the outset as the research of the single university proposals , but was selected for awards for other reasons . Policy inﬂuence might have created such a phenomenon . Because the ITR research program was aimed at fostering interdisciplinary col - laboration and large high - risk projects , peer reviewers and NSF program ofﬁcials might have been biased to select multi - institutional projects for funding , perhaps to spread the funds as far as possible or because review - ers were impressed by the diversity of multi - university projects . Maybereviewersrequiredlessintellectualrigor or social organization of projects if more universities were involved . If multi - university projects were not as wellconceivedinitiallyassingleuniversityprojects , then we would expect them to be less well coordinated and less productive as well . To evaluate the possibility of a selection bias , we obtainedananonymoussampleofunfundedITRpropos - alsfromtheNationalScienceFoundation . Thesampleof 549 unfunded proposals from the ﬁrst 4 years of the ITR program was matched with our sample of 549 funded proposals . These yoked pairs were based on the size of their proposed budgets and the R & D expenditures of the institutions that applied . The resulting dataset included the year of the proposal , whether it was a Large or Medium proposal ( each category having its own peer review panel ) , the number of investigators , and number of universities involved in the proposal , and whether or nottheproposalledtoanaward . Numberofinvestigators and number of universities were correlated r = 0 . 64 , thus larger projects were more likely to have multiple uni - versities represented . We then ran logistic regressions to assess whether the number of universities predicted whetherornotaproposalwasawardedagrant . Wefound that controlling for other variables , the number of uni - versities was a highly signiﬁcant predictor of whether or not an award was made ( Chi square = 10 . 4 , p < 0 . 01 ) . This analysis supports the idea that peer reviewers may have been biased to choose awards based on the number of universities that were involved in the proposal . A second possible explanation of our results is that multi - university projects began with investigators who did not know each other well and who needed time to form intellectual and social bonds as well as gain experi - encefromdoingresearchtogether . Lackofcollaboration experience would have made these projects inherently slower to get started and more difﬁcult . It is possible that an early lack of intellectual communication and work - ingrelationshipscausedtheseprojectstoexperiencebothinsufﬁcientcoordinationandpooreroutcomeswhenwemeasuredthemayearormoreafterbeginning .

Whentheseactivitiesareincludedinaregressionmodel , thedirectnegativerelationshipbetweennumber of universities and project outcomes disappears . Thus division of responsibilities and knowledge transfer activities are mediator variables , i . e . , they account for the negative effect of number of universities on project outcomes . 1632 J . N . Cummings , S . Kiesler / Research Policy 36 ( 2007 ) 1620 – 1634 Several of our survey items measured investiga - tors’ relationships prior to the current ITR project : Had you worked with this person ( each of the other senior researchers ) prior to this project ; did you pub - lish a peer - reviewed paper with this person ; did you receive research funding with this person . We cre - ated a composite measure , called prior collaboration ( Cronbach’s Alpha = 0 . 83 ) . With all the controls in the model , the number of universities in a project signiﬁcantly predicted not having prior collaboration experience ( F [ 1 , 541 ] = 7 . 5 , p < 0 . 01 ) . Furthermore , with controls and number of universities in the model , not having prior collaboration experience predicted fewer coordination activities in the current project ( divi - sion of responsibility F [ 1 , 541 ] = 1 . 8 , p = 0 . 06 ; shared resources F [ 1 , 541 ] = 5 . 8 , p = 0 . 01 ; knowledge transfer F [ 1 , 541 ] = 16 . 7 , p < 0 . 001 ; meetings F [ 1 , 541 ] = 11 . 8 , p < 0 . 001 ; communication technology F [ 1 , 541 ] = 9 . 7 , p < 0 . 01 ) . However , prior collaboration experience did not mediate or moderate the effect of the num - ber of universities on project outcomes . This ﬁnding suggests that prior collaboration experience predicts better coordination and that multi - university projects are likely to lack it , but does not show that requir - ing prior collaboration in proposals would resolve the comparatively low productivity of multi - university projects . In sum , our analyses suggest that selection bias and a lackofcollaborationexperiencemaycontributetomulti - university projects that are not as well organized , at least in the short run , as single university projects . 4 . 1 . Research policy implications Our analyses are directed at policies related to research programming . Our ﬁndings suggest policy tradeoffs for multi - university collaborations . On the one hand , long - term innovation , which we could not mea - sure , maybeimprovedbyhavinguniversitiescollaborate with other institutions that can offer expertise the single university cannot develop locally . Perhaps the type of expertise is too scarce to develop locally , is too expen - sive , or would not improve the competitive advantage of the institution . In the short - term , however , multi - universityprojectsweresigniﬁcantlylesssuccessfulthanprojectsperformedbyoneuniversity . In our data , even the difference between one and two universities began to show this decline , with signiﬁcantly negative effects on knowledge , tools , and leverage outcomes . Funding agencies might consider supporting exploratory grants to foster the development of new collaborations across institutions . Future studies could examine the value of training scientists to manage multi - university and multi - disciplinary collaborations . Our analyses controlled for NSF program experience ( start year of project ) , the R & D expenditures of the universities , the project budget , the number of senior researchers , and the number of disciplines involved in the project . Coordination activities predicted outcomes butchangesinthesebehaviorsdidnotlessenthenegativemulti - university impact on outcomes . We also examined other possible effects such as the difference between the proposal budget and actual funding , which did not account for the effects . However , perhaps budget cuts were associated with smaller investments in coordina - tion and a stronger focus on local rather than overall project goals . Finally , we can only speculate , but our ﬁndings and an analysis of another program , the KDI , suggest that the problem is partly due to an initial selection process that does not require multi - university projects to have the same level of quality , coherence , and evidence of true collaboration as single university projects . 4 . 2 . Extending the knowledge - based view The knowledge - based view of the ﬁrm has been extended to geographical clusters , in which ﬁrms are proximate to one another in a particular region so that they can beneﬁt from knowledge ﬂow within the clus - ter ( Maskell , 2001 ) . The knowledge - based view also has been applied to different sites within a research organi - zation ( Bohetal . , 2007 ) . Inthelatterstudy , collaborating across sites markedly increased coordination costs , and returns to collaboration were reduced when there was not careful management attention to the beneﬁts that would be realized by cross - site collaboration . Even so , numerous sites involved in collaboration reduced net ﬁnancial returns . We are not aware of prior literature extending the knowledge - based view to research collab - orations across institutions . We ﬁll this theoretical void by proposing a knowledge - based view of research col - laborations , in which the coordination costs are higher when researchers work in different universities and face more barriers to utilizing and integrating their exper - tise . Institutional and geographic forces do not create problems that can be easily alleviated by providing more shared resources or forcing communication . We believe that coordination costs need to play a more promi - nent role in discussions of the knowledge - based view , given that key constructs such as transferability , capac - ity for aggregation , and appropriability ( Grant , 1996a , b ) depend on the institutional and spatial conﬁguration of members .

Limitations and future directions Though we have data on a large number of research collaborations , there are a few signiﬁcant issues we did not consider . First , we focused on short - term outcomes in research collaboration , rather than the quality of a particular outcome or long - term outcomes . For exam - ple , we asked respondents whether or not they published articles based on the research , but we did not collect data on their number of articles or citations . We also exam - ined only outcomes directly related to the collaborations and not the other opportunities foregone by participating in these collaborations . It is possible that having multi - ple universities in a project has a different impact on the quality of research or long - term outcomes ( although we speculate that short - term and long - term outcomes , and quality , are likely related ) . Second , in addition to multi - ple universities , there are other factors that inﬂuence the success of research , including funding agency structures and university tenure processes that favor disciplinary work ( MetzgerandZare , 1999 ) . Wedonothaveinforma - tionaboutwhatledinvestigatorstoseekoutfundingfromtheNSFITRprogram , and what the opportunity costs were of doing so across disciplinary and organizational boundaries . Future work would beneﬁt greatly from understanding the longer term consequences of multi - university collaborations and the decision processes that underlie engaging in multi - university collaborations .
