This paper represents the first effort to study the opinions of departmental managers regarding an integrating device before its implementation . Departmental and graduate studies committee chairpersons were surveyed regarding their opinions on the need for and potential use of a database system which would provide the departments with easier access to data regarding graduate education and would provide the graduate school with an easier means of monitoring departmental activities pertaining to graduate educa - tion . The results show overwhelming support for the system , and the size of the aca - demic unit is the best predictor of support , with the larger units voicing more support . . . . ° , . . . . . . . ° . , . . . . . . , . . . . . . . ° . , ° , . . . . ° , , , ° . . . , . , * * . . . . . , , * . . , . , . . , , . . . . . . . , . . , ° , . . , . ° . . . . , • , . ° . . . ° . , , , . . . . . , . * ° , . . . , . * * . . . . . ° , * , . . , , . ° . , . . . . . , , . ° . ° . . , ° . , . ° . . . . , . . ° ° , . , . , , , . . . , . , . ° , . Most of the previous work on differentiation has dealt with private sector business organizations , while generally ignoring institutions of higher edu - cation , which are perhaps some of the most differentiated organizations in existence . This is especially true of the large public research university , which is highly differentiated both in structure and function , the extent of which was discussed by Blau ( 1973 ) . There is one major difference in terms of differentiation between the typical business firm and a university . While both types of organizations have specialized units performing specialized work , the units in the firms generally perform different types of work , for instance , marketing , produc - tion , sales , or research and development . A university is also differentiated in this respect in that there exists an admissions office , academic depart - ments , residence halls , career development offices , and an alumni office , all of which perform specialized tasks of a different nature . The difference between the two types of organizations lies in a further differentiation among the academic departments , where each academic department per - Gary D .

Vol . 25 , No . 1 82 DIFFERENTIATION IN GRADUATE EDUCATION 83 forms specialized work of a common nature ( namely , to educate the stu - dents ) , but the content of the instruction varies greatly by department . Because the subject matter of departments is very different for each , it is understandable that faculty members who have been trained in a specific area should want to determine the requirements for a degree in that area . But most institutions have also recognized the need to have some consistency across departments , thus the existence of graduate schools or colleges that are charged with such responsibilities as establishing minimum admission standards , credit hour requirements , and residency requirements . Graduate school administrators are also concerned about monitoring the quality of academic programs and the general reputation of the institution as a whole . For the purposes of this paper , the monitoring and coordinating activities of a graduate school are viewed as a form of integration . In order to perform such activities , the graduate school needs to collect data on each depart - ment , and at the particular graduate school in this study , a computerized database has been suggested as a means of assisting in such integrative activities . Before attempting to implement such a system , it is important for central administrators to know where their support lies and to encourage input from those supporters and potential users ( Lolli , 1984 ) . Lawrence and Lorsch ( 1967a , b ) have noted that the attitudes of both departmental and central administrators are crucial in the attempts to achieve coordination ; yet there has been no literature indicating research on the attitudes and perceptions of administrators prior to the implementation of a coordinating or integrating plan or device . One of the primary purposes of this study is to attempt to do just that , as departmental chairpersons and graduate study committee chair - persons of academic units are surveyed to obtain their opinions regarding the need for and potential use of a computerized database management system . The system will provide the graduate school with an easier means of monitoring graduate education in all academic departments , and it will provide the departments with easier access to data regarding graduate stu - dents . Another purpose of this paper is to determine not only overall support for the system , but to identify specific areas of support . Support for the system is analyzed along four dimensions : departmental size , as defined by the number of students in the department ; and the three Biglan ( 1973a , b ) di - mensions , which are low / high paradigm development , pure / applied re - search , and life / nonlife areas of study .
