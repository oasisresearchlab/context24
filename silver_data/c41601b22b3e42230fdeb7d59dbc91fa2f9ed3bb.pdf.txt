When used effectively this practice allows authors to present clearly large amounts of information in a single page . However , while sighted people can visually parse and understand these complex layouts in seconds , current assistive technologies such as screen readers cannot . This puts visually impaired users at a great disadvantage . In order to design better assistive technologies , we conducted a study of how people interpret modular layouts of news and shopping Web pages . The study revealed that when the layout complexity increases , the interpretation process gets longer and the reading gets more varied . Also , before looking at the main content , users first frame the Web page by looking for familiar structural elements that can be used as references and entry points . These elements include navigational bars , search boxes , and ads . This implies that assistive technologies can reduce the time required to frame the pages if they help users identify reference points and entry points .

INTRODUCTION Effective information presentations are critical for information rich domains such as online news and shopping Web sites . Their reason for being is to present their contents to their users in a way that is convenient , interesting , and easy to understand . Designing Web pages that meet these requirements is especially challenging given the amount and complexity of the information , as well as the different affordances and constraints of online digital information , such as interactivity and dynamic content . Authors of news and shopping Web sites must come up with document designs that take these requirements into account . However , authors cannot disregard the traditional design conventions of printed media . From a historical perspective , news and shopping Web sites are relative newcomers to well - established fields with long - standing practices and conventions . These fields have clearly identifiable document genres such as newspapers and catalogs . Over time , they have developed characteristic document formats and designs based on what has been proven to work well for both publishers and readers . Furthermore , readers are familiar with these publication genres and they have strong expectations of what and how information should be presented in them . This combination of factors compels Web page authors to design their documents following the established genres whenever possible . A case in point is the use of multiple columns and modular layouts . Multi - column layouts have been used in news and shopping documents for centuries [ 21 ] . Multiple columns make pages easier to read , provide flexibility for layout design , and allow including large amounts of information in a single page ; the more columns , the more elements that can be included . Modular layouts – frequently used by newspapers , catalogs and magazines – are even more flexible than strict column formats ( see figure 1 ) . They use a combination of vertical and horizontal shapes to package the information . Modular layouts provide a clean and simple appearance , improve legibility , save time in the production process , provide significant advertising advantages , and , more importantly , readers prefer them [ 16 ] . Figure 1 . Blueprint of a Modular Layout Authors of news and shopping Web sites often use modular layouts while also taking advantage of the intrinsic affordances of Web pages ( such as the ability to keep some modules always Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page .

This presentation strategy is so effective and widely used that , often times , interpreting a document’s layout becomes indispensable to understand fully its contents . This approach is highly effective for sighted users , but it also places visually impaired users at a great disadvantage . While assistive technologies such as screen readers can read aloud the content of a Web page [ 11 ] , modular page layouts have a multi - dimensional nature that challenges the unidimensional interaction style of screen readers [ 26 ] . This is a major limitation that restricts visually impaired users from accessing key structural cues required for fully understanding pages . The WARP V . I . P . project aims at solving this issue . WARP V . I . P . builds on the WARP [ 10 ] and AudibleSpace projects [ 7 ] . It uses a Multi - model Adaptive Spatial Hypermedia approach [ 9 ] to parse and interpret the layout of Web pages and inform visually impaired people ( V . I . P . ) about the structure of the information . Figure 2 . WARP V . I . P . WARP V . I . P . works as an intermediary ( see figure 2 ) . It uses two user models . The sighted user model helps the system to interpret modular layouts . The V . I . P . user model guides the system when interacting with visually impaired people . The effectiveness of system depends on the accuracy of the user models . In order to build them , two studies were conducted to learn more about how sighted people and visually impaired people use and interact with news and shopping Web sites that use modular layouts . This paper focuses on the study conducted with sighted users . The following section elaborates on the problem , presents the related work , and discusses the implications of this issue for the fields of adaptive hypermedia and spatial hypermedia . Next , section 3 presents the details of the study . The results are presented in section 4 . Section 5 discusses the implications of the study results . Finally , section 6 presents the conclusions . 2 . MODULAR LAYOUTS IN WEB PAGES Learning how people interpret modular layouts is highly relevant for adaptive hypermedia and spatial hypermedia research due to the intrinsic use of visual relationships in modular layouts and the abundance of Web pages with modular layouts . But , first , it is best to consider what modular layouts are and why they are so effective and widely used in news and shopping publications . 2 . 1 Modular Layouts in News and Shopping While online Web sites have different affordances and constraints , they build on the precedents set by paper - based newspapers and catalogs . The first modern newspaper ( defined as a written publication containing news and printed using movable type ) is the Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien , first published in 1605 1 . Similarly , Aaron Montgomery Ward is often credited for the first mail - order catalog 2 in 1872 [ 17 ] . This long period has given these genres the chance to evolve and adapt in response to what has proven to work for publishers and readers . This has produced a set of well - established practices and conventions , and has influenced the design of digital documents . The modular layout is a case in point . News and shopping documents have used multi - column layouts for centuries . The Daily Advertiser first published a four - column format edition in 1754 [ 21 ] . By the nineteenth century 8 columns were quite standard around the world . Multi - column layouts were adopted because they provided multiple advantages over the single column design . Narrow columns increased reading speed and reduced the chance of people losing their place when moving their gaze to the next line [ 16 ] and editors were able to include multiple stories in a single page . Newspaper layouts have evolved considerably since their inception . By the 1970s , most newspapers had moved away from strict column rules and decorative type to a modular layout design [ 16 ] . Today , layouts vary significantly ( from 5 to 11 column grid ) , but most broadsheet papers use a six - column grid [ 16 ] . Modular page layouts are the result of centuries of trial and error and advertising considerations , as well as decades of scientific research on legibility [ 16 ] . They package the information using a combination of vertical and horizontal rectangles . This has several advantages , including being very flexible ( e . g . , columns can be merged to highlight stories ) and adaptable to changes ( e . g . , layout editors can easily substitute modules without affecting the rest of the page ) . This format gives editors freedom to group related stories and images . It also offers important marketing advantages by making it easier to sell advertising space . From a reader’s perspective , modular layouts allow for seeing the words in groups of related information chunks , making it easier to parse and understand the document quickly . Furthermore , because these groups are represented visually , readers process this information perceptually ( as opposed to cognitively ) . This alleviates the readers’ cognitive load and allows authors to clearly present more information in a document . 2 . 2 Reading Behavior on the Web Many researchers have studied how people use and interact with Web pages . These have revealed general reading patterns for Web pages . People do not read Web pages sequentially or completely . In general , browsing is a rapid interactive process where most activity happens on the top - left quarter of the page [ 22 ] . When 1 While Johann Carolus ( publisher of the Relation ) had previously published hand - written newsletters , it was in 1605 that he first published a printed report after buying a complete printing shop because it took ’too much time copying by hand’ . 2 Others cite Benjamin Franklin’s 1744 catalog of scientific books as the first mail - order catalog [ 23 ] . WARP V . I . P . Web page User Sighted user model VIP user model people access a Web page , they first scan it quickly before deciding what to read or not . After that , reading follows various reading paths , starting at different entry - points [ 17 ] . Researchers have studied specifically how people read and use news Web sites [ 17 , 15 ] . These studies revealed that , when reading , people use different styles and activities . Reading , skimming , and scanning require different presentation , navigation , and visualization styles [ 15 ] . Eye - tracking studies provide a solid foundation for understanding how sighted people parse the Web page’s layout [ 17 ] . These studies have identified and measured important reading behaviors such as scanpaths , gaze fixations , and banner blindness . This has allowed designers to evaluate their pages using metrics such as “time to find” and “time to click” in order to identify reading issues and optimize critical aspects such as image size and positioning . The visual aspect of a Web site has a significant impact on how people assess credibility [ 6 ] . Credibility and trust are critical factors for most sites , but especially for news and shopping sites . For instance , Lee et al . found that people revisit shopping sites more when they have a higher level of trust in the store [ 13 ] . 2 . 3 Adaptive Hypermedia Adaptive hypermedia systems adapt hypermedia documents to the user’s needs , goals and preferences . They rely on user models to guide their adaptation process [ 4 , 5 ] . While adaptive hypermedia systems initially focused on a single user model approach , the tendency in recent years is to use multiple open models [ 1 , 3 , 9 ] . Several projects have studied how to use multiple models to adapt news to the user preferences and the display device [ 1 , 3 ] . While different user models have been used such as short - term and long term user interests [ 3 ] , building a model for modular layout would be beneficial for many Web - based adaptive hyper - media systems . However , in order to build such a model , first it is necessary to conduct the required experiments to study the user behavior and specific characteristics of modular layouts . The study presented here provides key insights into what to include in such a model . Previous research efforts have investigated using structural information in adaptive systems . E . g . , Bailey et al studied the creation of adaptive systems using an open hypermedia approach [ 2 ] . While WARP V . I . P . shares this interest in the separation of content and structure , it uses a multi - model adaptive spatial hypermedia approach . 2 . 4 Spatial Hypermedia Increasingly , mainstream Web pages are adding spatial hypermedia functionality such as the ability for users to move and reposition page elements . E . g . , BBC News allows users to drag - and - drop sections ( layout modules ) , minimize sections and save their layout preferences . However , these pages lack a fundamental feature of spatial hypermedia , namely , its ability to recognize implicit structures that rely on the interpretation of a node’s spatial context [ 15 ] . Spatial hypermedia systems have a spatial parser that can be used to parse and interpret the visual relationships used in modular layouts . However , while current spatial hypermedia systems can help to parse modular layouts , it is necessary to improve their spatial parsers to better interpret modular layouts . Up to now , most spatial hypermedia systems have preferred generic spatial parsers that did not used on context - specific heuristics [ 8 , 15 , 19 ] . This is appropriate when it cannot be assumed that the initial document layout will be meaningful . However , for mainstream Web sites , much care is taken to design meaningful modular layouts that follow a set of good design practices [ 16 ] : • Placing related elements in a vertical module • Boxing related elements • Running the headline over related elements • Running the story alongside and under related elements • Using icons , color or other elements to show relationships . Spatial parsers can take advantage of these practices , as well as the parsing and interpretation strategies identified by the study reported in this paper . 2 . 5 Assistive Technologies In today’s society , accessing the Web has become indispensable . However , most mainstream shopping sites have poor accessibility . Takagi et al . [ 20 ] studied the accessibility of 30 international shopping sites and found that the average reaching time for the first result line in item search varied from 98 seconds for US sites to 178 for Japanese sites [ 20 ] . This difficult situation stems from the fact that some of the best design approaches for sighted users , such as modular layouts , are some of the most problematic for visually impaired users . The same features that make modular layouts so advantageous for sighted people make them very difficult to parse and interpret automatically . They use the two dimensions of the screen extensively , represent relationships implicitly , and they are subject to change in response to last minute editorial needs . The two - dimensionality of modular layouts poses a serious challenge . Converting two - dimensional presentations to a one - dimensional stream of speech is difficult . Researchers have been investigating this issue with presentations such as tables [ 26 ] . The need to improve screen readers has been noted by many researchers . Yesilada et al . highlighted the inability of screen readers to “see the implicit structural and mobility knowledge encoded within the visual presentation of Web pages” [ 25 ] . Jay et al . noted that the presentation of information assists in task completion and suggested that presentation aspects should be re - introduced to non - visual presentations [ 12 ] . Researchers have also conducted eye - tracking studies of sighted users in order to inform their design of new and improved assistive technologies [ 12 , 25 ] . These studies have proven useful only to a point because they do not ascertain directly how people interpret the layout , nor do they provide results that can be easily compared to the experiences of visually impaired people . In contrast , the study presented in this paper produced data that can be directly compared with the data of a complementary study with visually impaired people . The details of the study are explained in the following section . 3 . STUDY The study was conducted in the second half of 2008 in the Information Experience Lab at the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin . 20 sighted participants 3 ( 14 female , 6 male ) were recruited from the university community and the greater Austin area via fliers , email messages , and word of mouth . 3 Later , a data collection error reduced the sample number to 19 . The educational level ranged from high school graduates , to graduate students . At a minimum , all participants were familiar with Web browsing and basic computer applications ( e . g . , email , chat ) . The study collected qualitative and quantitative data following the process presented in table 1 . Sessions were video recorded . Session times ranged from 1 to 2 hours . Table 1 . Study Timetable Minutes Activity 10 Welcome and Informed Consent Form 5 Explanation of study 5 Initial Survey 60 - 90 Web page evaluations 10 Final Interview and goodbyes 90 - 120 Total 3 . 1 Initial Survey This step used a Web - based survey to collect basic demographic information such as gender , age range , education level , and computer expertise . 3 . 2 Web Page Evaluations This step collected quantitative and qualitative data about the participants’ perception of layout complexity and about how they parse and interpret the structural information implicit in the Web pages layout . Specifically , the study collected : • Participants’ responses to questions • Video of the participants describing their interpretations • Video of the screen interactions of the participants • Researchers observations and notes Participants were presented with 16 mainstream Web pages , one at the time . Researchers selected the pages based on their genre and the complexity of their layouts . As table 2 shows , 8 pages were shopping sites and 8 were news sites . Similarly , 8 pages had simple layouts and the other 8 had complex layouts . Layout complexity was determined objectively , based on the number of groups and subgroups visually present in the pages – the more groups and subgroups , the higher the complexity . Table 2 . Web Page Classes News Shopping Simple NS BBC News Google News Medline Plus News NPR SS Shopzilla Overstock CD Universe MSN Shopping Complex NC Boston Globe Fox News Chicago Tribune USA Today SC Buy Footlocker Zappos Toys R Us In order to ensure that all participants looked at the same information , all pages were locally cached . The order of presentation was generated at random and then divided into two sets ( A and B ) . Half of the participants saw set A followed by set B , and the other half saw set B followed by set A . During the sessions , a member of the research team sat next to the participant such that researcher they could observe and talk to her / him . The researcher asked the participant to talk aloud and to interpret the Web page’s layout by explaining how the information was structured and identifying groups and subgroups . Participants took as much time as they wanted to interact with the pages . The participants’ interpretations , descriptions and explanations were recorded using video . Their interactions with the Web page were recorded using Morae 4 . After describing their interpretations verbally , participants were asked four questions : 1 ) FAMILIARITY : How familiar are you with this site ? 1 never seen it 2 seen it once 3 less than 10 times / few times a year 4 several times a month 5 daily or almost daily 2 ) BROWSER : How complex is the page on a scale from 1 - 5 ? 1 - very simple → 5 - very complex 3 ) CONTENT : How well do you like the content on a scale from 1 - 5 ? 1 - don ' t like → 5 - love it 4 ) LAYOUT : How well do you like the layout on a scale from 1 - 5 ? 1 - don ' t like → 5 - love it The purpose of these questions was to assess whether and how much the users’ perception of layout complexity was affected by page familiarity , and personal likes / dislikes of content and style . After answering these questions , participants were shown screen - capture images of the same pages . Again , they were asked to interpret the layout and identify groups and subgroups . Afterwards , participants were asked to assess the complexity of the layout again by answering a fifth question : 5 ) IMAGE : How complex is the page on a scale from 1 - 5 ? 1 - very simple → 5 - very complex This question collected a second complexity assessment . The purpose of this was to determine how much does the medium affect participants’ perceptions of complexity . 3 . 3 Final Interview After the participants finished interpreting the layout of all the pages , a free form interview was conducted to gather additional qualitative data such as comments , suggestions , and clarifications about the participants’ interpretations . 3 . 4 Data Analysis Quantitative data was analyzed statistically conducting ANOVA analyses . The analysis included the initial survey data , the participants’ answers to the 5 questions presented during the Web Page Evaluation , and the numerical data obtained during the coding and visualization phases ( e . g . , length of the interpretation process measured in steps , frequency of structural elements ) . Qualitative data was analyzed in order to identify patterns and similarities in the participant’s interpretations , and to study the process used by each individual participant . The analysis followed an eight - phase process . 4 http : / / www . techsmith . com / morae . asp 1 ) Data Collection . Videos and notes were gathered . 2 ) Coding . Two team members of the research group ( coders 5 ) reviewed the videos and experimental notes . They coded all videos and generated a brief description of the interpretation process followed by each participant . This allowed representing interpretation processes as sequences of steps . 3 ) Aggregation . Step - by - step process descriptions were grouped by page and converted into interpretation tables . 4 ) Standardization . A third member of the research group ( analyst ) reviewed all process descriptions , standardized codes , and augmented the interpretation tables accordingly . 5 ) Initial Analysis . The analyst conducted an initial analysis , compiling a list of inferences and observations that needed clarification and / or verification . 6 ) Clarification . Coders re - reviewed videos and notes , clarified doubts and verified initial inferences and observations . 7 ) Second Analysis . The analyst performed a second analysis , improving the data visualizations and creating a revised list of inferences and observations . 8 ) Results . The research team discussed the revised list of observations and interpretations and generated final results . The analysis relied on three critical aspects : identifying the steps taken by participants , assign codes to the steps , and standardizing the codes . It took several iterations and data visualizations before the codes where properly standardized and a proper visualization was obtained . As table 3 shows , the standardized codes allow classifying steps by Function and Specificity ( the codes shown in each category are just some examples ) . Table 3 .

As a guideline , page elements used mostly for navigational or functional support , or that provided tangential content , were considered “Structural” ( S ) . Elements used mostly to present the pages’ contents were classified as “Content” ( C ) . For example , ads were included in structural category because many participants used them as reference points without really paying attention to their content . As mentioned before , devising a proper visualization technique for the steps was a critical aspect of the data analysis . It needed to be useful at the individual level as well as at the aggregate level . 5 The terms “coders” and “coding” are used in the ethnographic sense and not in the computer science sense . Figure 2 shows two examples of individual interpretation steps . The first box represents a step where the participant looked at the genre - specific content element “top stories” which was located in the middle column and named . The second box represents a step where the participant looked at the navigational bar on the left , parsing it from top to bottom . GC : top stories ( middle ) S : nav ( left ) < all the way down > Figure 2 . Interpretation Steps Figure 4 shows the interpretation table for one pages ( consisting of 19 interpretation processes 6 ) . This data representation facilitated the identification of patterns of behavior across participants , page genres , and complexity levels . Furthermore , this level of abstraction is subject for quantitative analysis of aspects such as average number of steps , order of steps , and frequency of particular steps . This made it possible to integrate qualitative data with quantitative data . 4 . RESULTS The study collected qualitative and quantitative data for multiple aspects . While for some aspects only quantitative data was collected , in many cases a combination of quantitative and qualitative data was collected and analyzed . Rather than presenting the results by the type of data , this section is organized by the aspects measured . 4 . 1 Layout Complexity As mentioned before , participants assessed the layout complexity after looking at the page as a live Web page and as an image . The goal was to identify possible effects of the medium’s affordances and constraints . Figure 3 shows the overall distribution of complexity assessments of all pages by all participants . Figure 3 . Distribution of All Complexity Assessments Participants provided different assessments of the layout complexity depending on whether they looking at the browser or image . The overall perceived complexity for each condition was computed by averaging the complexity assessments of all participants for all pages ( 16 pages x 19 participants ) . Table 4 shows the perceived complexity in both conditions . 6 Note that P03 is not included . As mentioned before , one sample had to be dropped , leaving a total of 19 participants . Figure 4 . Interpretation Table for the Chicago Tribune Web Page A Wilcoxon Matched - Pairs Signed - Ranks Test ( p = 0 . 005 ) and a paired t - test ( p = 0 . 002 ) showed significant differences between the BROWSER and IMAGE conditions . This implies that the perception of complexity does not depend only on the layout itself , but also on the browser itself . However , these differences were only at the aggregate level . Looking at the complexity assessments one page at a time , only two pages showed significant differences , as illustrated in table 4 . Similarly , looking at the complexity assessments one participant at a time , only two had significant differences ( P08 p = 0 . 027 ; P11 p = 0 . 039 ) . Table 4 .

Tables 5 and 6 show the average complexity assessments for each genre - complexity pair ( SS , SC , NS , NC ) in the BROWSER and IMAGE conditions . Table 5 . Layout Complexity in BROWSER condition SIMPLE COMPLEX μ = 2 . 079 μ = 2 . 947 SHOPPING σ = 0 . 876 σ = 1 . 069 p ≤ 0 . 0001 μ = 2 . 566 μ = 3 . 184 NEWS σ = 1 . 075 σ = 0 . 976 p ≤ 0 . 0001 p ≤ 0 . 002 p ≤ 0 . 155 Table 6 . Layout Complexity in IMAGE condition SIMPLE COMPLEX μ = 2 . 184 μ = 3 . 171 SHOPPING σ = 0 . 976 σ = 0 . 985 p ≤ 0 . 0001 μ = 2 . 632 μ = 3 . 342 NEWS σ = 1 . 005 σ = 0 . 946 p ≤ 0 . 0001 p ≤ 0 . 006 p ≤ 0 . 276 As seen in tables 5 and 6 , similar significant differences were detected in the BROWSER and IMAGE conditions . As expected , results showed a significant difference between complex and simple Web pages , both for news and shopping sites . Also , there were significant differences between news pages with simple layouts ( NS ) and shopping pages with simple layouts ( SS ) . However , there was no significant difference between complex news sites ( NC ) and complex shopping sites ( SC ) . 4 . 3 Process Length The length of the interpretation process varied considerably from 2 to 12 steps . The overall the average length of the interpretation process of all pages by all participants was μ = 5 . 17 steps per page . The average process length by participant ranged from 4 . 12 to 7 . 44 steps . These variations were consistent across genre and complexity level ( SS , SC , NS , NC ) . Gender was not a significant factor . While there was some variation ( males μ = 5 . 73 σ = 1 . 38 ; females μ = 4 . 94 σ = 0 . 83 ) this was not significant ( p > 0 . 13 ) . 4 . 4 Process Length and Complexity The length of the interpretation process depends on the layout complexity . Table 7 shows the average length for all pages . Table 7 .

E . g . , Medline Plus News had the most content of any page in the study . However , since it had just three distinct areas , the process length was below the average ( 4 . 84 ) . On the other hand , USA Today had much less content but , because its layout had many more groups and subgroups , it had an above - average process length ( 5 . 84 ) . The length of the process was significantly higher for complex pages . An ANOVA with replication test confirmed significant differences between simple and complex pages ( p < 0 . 01 ) and between shopping and news pages ( p < 0 . 01 ) . The complexity also increased within each genre , as illustrated by table 8 . Table 8 . Interpretation Process Length SIMPLE COMPLEX μ = 4 . 658 μ = 4 . 947 SHOPPING σ = 0 . 831 σ = 0 . 475 p ≤ 0 . 567 μ = 4 . 908 μ = 6 . 184 NEWS σ = 0 . 225 σ = 0 . 260 p ≤ 0 . 0004 p ≤ 0 . 583 p ≤ 0 . 004 4 . 5 Interpretation Process Participants exhibited similar patterns when interpreting Web pages . By comparing and contrasting the interpretation processes of all pages by all participants , it was possible to identify how and when people use different page elements . Given that the processes varied significantly in length , it was necessary to normalize them before being compared . Hence , the total number of steps in the process was converted to 100 % and each step was assigned a proportional value . E . g . , a process with 3 steps , like the one for P04 in figure 4 , was normalized by assigning a value of 33 % to the first step , 66 % to the second , and 100 % to the last ( table 9 ) . Table 9 . Normalized Interpretation Process Step Value Element Normalized Step Value 1 S : nav ( left ) 33 % 2 C : column ( middle ) 66 % 3 C : column ( right ) 100 % As table 9 shows , steps in the early part of the process have a lower normalized value than steps in the late part of the process . By normalizing all interpretation tables , researchers were able to compare the parsing order across participants , genres , and levels of complexity . Table 10 shows the average normalized step values for different types of elements , and the frequency which they were mentioned ( as % of total interpretation processes 7 ) . Table 10 .

E . g . , people first mention an element at the top of the page in the first 30 % of their interpretation process . Given that the average process length is 5 . 17 steps , this means that top elements are usually the first thing mentioned . Figure 5 shows the normalized steps for the different areas . Figure 5 . Parsing Order by Screen Area 4 . 6 Framing and Reference Points Before looking at the content , participants framed the content of the page . Participants parsed pages top to bottom and left to right looking for elements that can be used as reference points . Their general process was to look : first at structural modules ( S ) , second at genre - specific and page - specific modules ( GS , GC , PS , PC ) , third at general content in the middle , and last at bottom elements . Within the structural elements , participants looked first for generic elements present in most pages such as navigational bars , search boxes and ads . They identified them early in their parsing process . Table 11 shows s ome of the earliest - mentioned elements . Table 11 .

However , there were 7 Total interpretation processes = 19 * 16 = 304 8 Not all pages had a search box differences depending on their location ( top , left , or right ) . Table 12 shows the average order to the navigational bars . Table 12 . Navigation Bars in the Interpretation Process Element Normalized Step ( % ) S : nav ( top ) 46 . 06 S : nav ( left ) 48 . 68 S : nav ( right ) 67 . 51 When present in the page , search boxes were one of the first things to be noticed . Even if the participants’ task was not searching , most participants mentioned search boxes in the first or second step . The title was the element mentioned earliest in the interpretation process . However it was not mentioned often , possibly because it is easily grouped with the top navigation bar . Ads were used a reference points . Participants usually ignored ads in their interpretation process , but when they mentioned them , it was early in their process and they used them as reference points . Participants did not pay attention to their contents . This was evident in the way they referred to them using generic terms such as “ads” , “slideshow” or “other stuff” . Furthermore , this behavior of noting the ads’ presence but ignoring their contents was consistent as participants kept moving down the page . 4 . 7 Reading Style and Layout Complexity Layout complexity affects reading behavior . When interacting with simple Web pages , participants followed the same general process with little variations . When the layout complex increased , the participant’s processes became more varied . Cross - column reading was more prevalent in complex pages . When parsing and interpreting simple layouts , participants focused on one column at a time . Only after going down for at least one frame , they would switch their attention to another column or module . In contrast , when the layout was complex , the participants tended to switch between columns and modules more often . Also , it is worth mentioning that column switching was usually done at the end of the process ( normalized step 81 . 47 % ) . 4 . 8 Familiarity , Content and Layout A final consideration was to check how much did the factors of FAMILIARITY ( how often participants visited the pages ) , CONTENT ( how much did participants liked the contents ) , and LAYOUT ( how much did participants liked the layout ) affected the participants’ perception of complexity when looking at the pages in a browser ( BROWSER ) or as images ( IMAGE ) . Familiarity with the pages did not seem to affect the participants’ perception of layout complexity . FAMILIARITY ranged from 1 . 06 ( Shopzilla ) to 3 . 5 ( Google News ) and it was not correlated ( or just weakly correlated ) to BROWSER , IMAGE , or LAYOUT . However , there was only a mild correlation between CONTENT and FAMILIARITY ρ = 0 . 4380 . This low correlation was somehow surprising , as one could assume that people normally become familiar with a Web page because they visit it frequently , and that they visit it frequently because they like its contents . A significant factor is how much people like the Web page layout . LAYOUT was strongly correlated with CONTENT ρ = 0 . 6396 , meaning that the higher the chance that someone likes the layout , the higher the chance that they like the content , and vice versa . Finally , the perception of complexity BROWSER was mildly correlated ( ρ = 0 . 3609 ) with LAYOUT ( but not with CONTENT ) . 5 . DISCUSSION The study confirmed some of the findings of previous eye tracking and reading behavior studies , including that : • Most people first perform a quick parsing before looking at the contents of the Web page . • Most people read and interpret Web pages from top to bottom and left to right . • Ads and banners tend to be ignored ( banner blindness ) . The study revealed key insights into the interpretation process of modular layouts in Web pages . The perception of layout complexity is correlated with the number of layout modules : the more modules , the higher the complexity . The perception of layout complexity is also affected by factors such as the medium and how much people like the layout . However , it is not safe to assume that people are OK with the layout complexity just because they are familiar with the page . The length of the interpretation process depends more on the complexity of the layout than on the amount of content in the page . And , as the complexity increases , the interpretation process becomes more varied and less predictable . The general parsing and interpreting process is to frame the page top - bottom and left - right before switching their attention to the “main content” . The framing strategy usually implies looking for page elements that can be used as markers or reference points . People usually look first for familiar structural elements ( e . g . , navigational bars , search boxes and ads ) , followed by genre - specific and page - specific content and structural modules . This is consistent with previous studies of people reading newspapers that have found that reading is not done sequentially but rather by first parsing the page quickly and then looking for entry points to the content [ 17 ] . These findings have important implications for spatial hypermedia systems , adaptive hypermedia systems , and assistive technology . As mentioned before , spatial hypermedia systems have not typically focused on mainstream Web pages . Their spatial parsers use usually designed with generic parsing heuristics that do not consider modular layouts specifically . Given that many mainstream Web pages consistently use modular layouts to organize their information and convey a certain image , it follows that , augmenting spatial parsers with heuristics for modular layouts and genre - specific heuristics would facilitate the ability of spatial hypermedia to function better in a Web environment . The study presented here provides guidelines for improving spatial parsers . E . g . , spatial parsers should look for generic modules , ( e . g . , global navigation bar ) , genre - specific modules ( e . g . , “Top News” ) page - specific modules ( e . g . , “Browse the BBC” ) , and other page elements typically used by people as reference points for navigation or as entry points to the contents . The study results provide valuable guidelines for adaptive hypermedia systems . For instance , when selecting what elements to show or hide , it is important to consider that elements such as ads are often used as reference points , even if their contents are ignored . This study reinforces the argument that adapting Web pages should not focus solely on what content to show , annotate or hide , but it should also consider how to modify the layout such that people can parse it quickly , identify the modules , and find reference points and entry points to the Web page’s contents . 6 . CONCLUSION This paper discussed the characteristics of modular layouts and presented a study of how sighted people interpret modular layouts in news and shopping Web pages . The study revealed that , before looking at the main content , people first frame Web pages by looking at the top and sides of the page for familiar structural elements that can be used as reference points or entry points . The study revealed that the complexity of the layout plays an important role in the reading process 9 . While participants usually follow a top - down left - right process , when the layout complexity increases the interpretation process gets longer and the reading gets more varied . Also , the interpretation process seems to be affected more by layout complexity than by content amount . This work has shed some light on what sighted users typically use and identify in modular layouts . Web page authors and sighted users seem to share a common understanding of which elements can be used as reference points , including navigation bars , search boxes and ads . This has strong implications for the development of assistive technologies . Assistive technologies must be able to identify the elements typically used as reference points , interpret the layout modules , and convey all this information in appropriate ways . This could significantly reduce the time required to frame the page and would improve the users’ experience . The study also revealed ways for improving spatial and adaptive hypermedia systems . Specifically , it identified guidelines for modeling and parsing modular layouts in Web pages . 7 .
