Since the identification of a second talin gene in vertebrates , it has become increasingly clear that vertebrate Talin1 and Talin2 have non - redundant roles as essential links between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton in distinct plasma membrane - associated adhesion complexes . The conserved C - terminal I / LWEQ module is important for talin function . This structural element mediates the interaction of talins with F - actin . The I / LWEQ module also targets mammalian Talin1 to focal adhesion complexes , which are dynamic multicomponent assemblies required for cell adhesion and cell motility . Although Talin1 is essential for focal adhesion function , Talin2 is not targeted to focal adhesions . The nonvertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis has only one talin gene , but alternative splicing of the talin mRNA produces two proteins with different C - terminal I / LWEQ modules . Thus , C . intestinalis contains two talins , Talin - a and Talin - b , with potentially different activities , despite having only one talin gene . Results : We show here that , based on their distribution in cDNA libraries , Talin - a and Talin - b are differentially expressed during C . intestinalis development . The I / LWEQ modules of the two proteins also have different affinities for F - actin . Consistent with the hypothesis that Talin - a and Talin - b have different roles in cell adhesion , the distinct I / LWEQ modules of Talin - a and Talin - b possess different subcellular targeting determinants . The I / LWEQ module of Talin - a is targeted to focal adhesions , where it most likely serves as the link between integrin and the actin cytoskeleton . The Talin - b I / LWEQ module is not targeted to focal adhesions , but instead preferentially labels F - actin stress fibers . These different properties of C . intestinalis the Talin - a and Talin - b I / LWEQ modules mimic the differences between mammalian Talin1 and Talin2 . Conclusion : Vertebrates and D . discoideum contain two talin genes that encode proteins with different functions . The urochordate C . intestinalis has a single talin gene but produces two separate talins by alternative splicing that vary in a domain crucial for talin function . This suggests that multicellular organisms require multiple talins as components of adhesion complexes . In C . intestinalis , alternative splicing , rather than gene duplication followed by neo - functionalization , accounts for the presence of multiple talins with different properties . Given that C . intestinalis is an excellent model system for chordate biology , the study of Talin - a and Talin - b will lead to a deeper understanding of cell adhesion in the chordate lineage and how talin functions have been parceled out to multiple proteins during metazoan evolution .

BMC Cell Biology 2006 , 7 : 40 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2121 / 7 / 40 Page 2 of 11 ( page number not for citation purposes ) Background The amoebozoan and animal talins ( Fig . 1 ) are an ancient family of modular proteins that link the actin cytoskele - ton to the plasma membrane in several different multi - component adhesion complexes [ 1 - 3 ] . The amoebozoan cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum contains two talins , each of which has a different role in the D . discoi - deum life cycle . TalA is required for cell motility and adhe - sion to the substrate in undifferentiated amoebae [ 4 , 5 ] , and TalB is required for morphogenesis during multicellu - lar differentiation [ 6 , 7 ] . Vertebrates also have two talin genes , TLN1 and TLN2 , which encode Talin1 and Talin2 , respectively [ 3 , 8 - 10 ] . Talin1 is required for cell adhesion and motility and is the primary talin component of focal adhesions [ 6 , 7 , 11 ] . This role for Talin1 is analogous to that of TalA in adhesion and migration of D . discoideum amoebae [ 4 , 5 ] . Although Talin2 has not been completely characterized , the available evidence indicates that Talin1 and Talin2 have non - redundant roles in vertebrates , with Talin2 serving as a component of stable adhesions in dif - ferentiated tissues such as striated muscle [ 10 ] . This sug - gests that Talin2 may be an analog of D . discoideum TalB , which is required for multicellular differentiation [ 6 , 7 ] . Thus , at opposite ends of the large phylogenetic distance that separates amoebozoans and vertebrates within the opisthokont ( i . e . , animals , amoebozoans , and fungi ) lin - eage [ 3 , 12 ] , two different talins are required for cell adhe - sion in distinct adhesion assemblies . In contrast to D . discoideum and vertebrates , invertebrates including Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis ele - gans and the nonvertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis have only one talin gene [ 3 ] . However , alternative splicing of the talin mRNA in D . melanogaster and C . intestinalis produces multiple talins that vary at their C - termini [ 3 ] . Therefore , despite having only one talin gene , multiple talin proteins can account for the biological functions of talin in these organisms . Little is currently known about the functions of these talin splice variants . In this report we have determined that the I / LWEQ modules of the alternative splice variants of C . intestinalis talin have different actin - binding affinities and different subcellular targeting signals . We show that the Talin - b I / LWEQ module has a higher affinity for F - actin than the Talin - a I / LWEQ module and is also targeted to actin stress fibers in cells . In contrast , the Talin - a I / LWEQ module does not label stress fibers , but is instead targeted to focal adhesions . These differences are similar to those seen with Talin1 and Talin2 in vertebrates , where Talin1 is the link between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton in focal adhesions [ 11 , 13 ] . These results suggest that alterna - tive splicing is an effective mechanism for producing dis - tinct talin proteins with different functions in C . intestinalis . The recent completion of its genome sequence has increased the utility of C . intestinalis as a model chor - date [ 14 - 17 ] . Thus , further studies of Talin - a and Talin - b in C . intestinalis will be useful in identifying fundamental roles for distinct talin proteins in cell adhesion in chor - dates . Results Identification of C . intestinalis Talin - a and Talin - b During a previous analysis of the evolutionary history of amoebozoan and animal talins we determined that the C . intestinalis genome contains one talin gene , but that alter - native splicing produces two talin proteins , based on the presence of multiple , distinct cDNA sequences in the Gen - Bank expressed sequence tag ( EST ) database [ 3 ] . Like all the other talins previously identified , the full - length C . intestinalis talin contains an N - terminal FERM domain linked to a C - terminal I / LWEQ module by a central α - hel - ical rod domain [ 18 ] . In the present study we have identi - fied multiple cDNA clones corresponding to C . intestinalis Talin - a and Talin - b ( Table 1 ) . These data indicate that Talin - a is perhaps more widely expressed , based on the distribution of cDNAs in the available libraries , than Talin - b . Talin - a cDNAs were found in libraries from the whole adult organism , heart , gastrula / neurula , tailbud embryo , free swimming larva , blood cells , neural com - plex , and testis . In addition to these C . intestinalis Talin - a cDNAs , several Talin - a ESTs were also identified from the tunicate Molgula tectiformis . Talin - b cDNAs have been identified from libraries prepared from blood cells and the adult organism . We have also identified a Talin - b EST from a cDNA library prepared from gastrula of the tuni - cate Ciona savignyi , so this splice variant is not restricted only to C . intestinalis ( Table 1 ) . Comparison of the variant cDNA sequences of C . intesti - nalis with the genomic DNA sequence showed that the two cDNAs are the result of alternative splicing at the end of exon 48 of the talin transcript ( Fig . 2A ) . The alternative final protein - coding exon 49 produces talin proteins that are 42 % identical over their C - terminal 78 amino acids ( Fig . 2B ) . This sequence divergence is greater than that between the paralogous human Talin1 and zebrafish Talin2 , which are 82 % identical over the same region , and is more comparable to the divergence between human Talin1 and Caenorhabditis elegans talin , which are 57 % identical at their C - termini .

The modular structure of talin is illustrated and representative binding sites for partners of vertebrate Talin1 are indicated [ 1 , 2 , 13 ] . All known talins , including C . intestinalis talin , contain an N - terminal FERM domain and a C - termi - nal I / LWEQ module [ 18 ] . The FERM domain is a conserved element that links various proteins to the plasma membrane [ 38 ] . The I / LWEQ module is a conserved F - actin - binding element that also targets Talin1 to focal adhesions in mammalian cells [ 13 ] . We show in this report that the I / LWEQ module of C . intestinalis Talin - a also contains a focal adhesion targeting signal . VBS : vinculin binding sites of Talin1 . Scale bar : 500 amino acids .

We have recently determined that the C - terminus of the I / LWEQ module , corresponding to the splice variant sequences of C . intesti - nalis Talin - a and Talin - b , contains the minimal actin - binding site of mammalian Talin1 [ 13 ] . This observation led us to determine whether the actin - binding affinities of the I / LWEQ modules of Talin - a and Talin - b for F - actin are different ( Fig . 3 ) . We found that the Talin - b construct binds to F - actin with an apparent K d of 0 . 19 μ M , while the Talin - a I / LWEQ module bound with an apparent K d of 0 . 76 μ M . These values are similar to those we previously determined for mammalian Talin1 and Talin2 , whose K d values were 0 . 31 μ M and 0 . 88 μ M , respectively [ 22 ] . Subcellular targeting of Talin - a and Talin - b Focal adhesions are dynamic multi - component adhesion complexes required for cell adhesion and cell motility [ 23 , 24 ] . Talin1 is required for the assembly of focal adhe - sions [ 25 ] , and we recently determined that the I / LWEQ module of Talin1 is also essential for targeting this talin isoform to focal adhesions in mammalian cells [ 13 ] . Because C . intestinalis Talin - a and Talin - b vary in this sub - cellular targeting region of talin , we used expression of dsRed - Talin - a and dsRed - Talin - b fusion proteins to deter - mine whether the Talin - a and Talin - b I / LWEQ modules also have different subcellular targeting determinants in mammalian cells . Interestingly , we found that the I / LWEQ module of Talin - a strongly labels focal adhesions in HeLa cells ( Fig . 4 , column 1 , arrowheads ) , where the dsRed - Talin - a fusion protein colocalized with the diag - nostic focal adhesion component vinculin ( overlay ) . Although the Talin - a I / LWEQ module does interact with F - actin in vitro ( Fig . 3 ) , it did not preferentially label actin stress fibers in cells ( Fig . 4 column 2 ; arrowheads identify dsRed - Talin - a in focal adhesions at the ends of stress fib - ers ) . In contrast to Talin - a , the Talin - b I / LWEQ module was not targeted to focal adhesions ( Fig . 4 , column 3 ; arrowheads identify stress fiber localization of dsRed - Talin - b I / LWEQ module ) , but instead strongly labeled actin stress fibers in HeLa cells ( Fig . 4 , column 4 , arrow - heads ) , where dsRed - Talin - b I / LWEQ module colocalized with FITC - phalloidin - labeled F - actin ( overlay ) . Discussion Analysis of EST data produced primarily by Nori Satoh and colleagues of Kyoto University [ 26 ] has shown that alternative splicing of talin pre - mRNA leads to the pro - duction of two proteins with different C - termini in C . intestinalis . The variable distributions of Talin - a and Talin - b in different cDNA libraries suggest that Talin - a and Talin - b are differentially expressed during C . intestinalis development . We have also shown that the variant I / LWEQ modules of Talin - a and Talin - b have different bio - logical properties : Talin - b has the higher affinity for F - actin and preferentially labels actin stress fibers , while Talin - a is targeted to focal adhesions . Therefore , alterna - tive processing is a mechanism for producing multiple talin proteins , with distinct activities associated with a critical structural element , in these nonvertebrate chor - dates , even though the C . intestinalis genome contains only one talin gene . Alternative splicing is a widespread mechanism for expanding the proteome . In humans , 30 – 65 % of all gene Table 1 : Distribution of Talin - a and Talin - b cDNAs .

Alternative splicing frequently results in changes in protein structure that alter protein - protein interactions . For example , alternative splicing of the non - erythroid protein 4 . 1R produces vari - ants that alter the efficiency of the interaction with the spectrin / actin complex by a factor of two [ 28 ] . This is sim - ilar to differences we have identified in the C . intestinalis talin alternative splice variants , where the Talin - b I / LWEQ module interacts with F - actin with a four - fold higher affinity than that of Talin - a . The higher affinity for F - actin may explain the preferential localization of the Talin - b I / LWEQ module to actin stress fibers in cells . Alternative splicing can also alter subcellular targeting determinants of the resultant proteins [ 27 ] . HeLa cells represent a heterologous system for the study of tunicate talins in vivo , but we have recently used them to determine that the C - terminal I / LWEQ module of Talin1 contains a focal adhesion targeting determinant [ 13 ] . We have shown here that the Talin - a I / LWEQ module , but not that of Talin - b , is targeted to focal adhesions in HeLa cells . Although focal adhesions have not yet been directly observed in C . intestinalis cells , the C . intestinalis genome contains genes for several characteristic focal adhesion components that were previously thought to be restricted to vertebrates . These include at least 14 α - integrins , 5 β - integrins , focal adhesion kinase , vinculin , and α - actinin [ 15 ] . Vinculin and β - integrin are well - characterized Talin1 binding partners . Given the presence of these classical focal adhesion proteins in C . intestinalis , our results sug - gest that Talin - a is likely to function similarly to mamma - lian Talin1 as an adhesion complex component during C . intestinalis development . The lack of a focal adhesion - tar - geting determinant in the C - terminus of Talin - b may indi - Subcellular targeting of the I / LWEQ modules of Talin - a and Talin - b Figure 4 Subcellular targeting of the I / LWEQ modules of Talin - a and Talin - b .

Talin2 is not targeted to focal adhesions in undifferentiated cells but is preferentially targeted to cos - tameres and intercalated disks , which are stable adhesions in differentiated striated muscle [ 10 ] . The presence of two related , but ancient and highly diver - gent talins ( 30 % identical ) with different physiological roles in D . discoideum [ 4 - 6 ] supports the hypothesis that gene duplication , followed by neo - functionalization , pro - duced multiple talins that are required for cell adhesion during cell differentiation [ 3 , 29 ] . A similar explanation may also account for the maintenance of Talin1 and Talin2 in vertebrates since duplication of the ancestral animal talin early in the chordate lineage , more than 450 million years ago [ 3 ] . In support of this hypothesis regard - ing vertebrate talins , several recent studies have shown that these distinct proteins indeed have different roles . Talin1 and Talin2 interact with different proteins [ 3 , 30 , 31 ] and have different affinities for their common partner F - actin [ 22 ] . Talin1 is required for mammalian embryogenesis , probably as an essential component of adhesion complexes required for cell motility during gas - trulation [ 32 ] . Talin2 is unable to complement this lethal phenotype . We have recently shown that the adult tissue distributions of mammalian Talin1 and Talin2 also vary , with Talin1 being the more widely expressed isoform [ 10 ] . Talin2 is most abundant in brain and muscle . We have shown that Talin2 is induced during muscle differen - tiation along with other muscle - specific proteins such as archvillin , integrin - β 1 D , and metavinculin , which is an alternative splice variant of vinculin [ 10 ] . As expected , Talin1 is a component of focal adhesions in undifferenti - ated myoblasts , but Talin2 is not found in focal adhesions of these cells or other mammalian cells . Talin2 is instead a component of stable adhesion assemblies such as cos - tameres and intercalated disks in mature striated muscle [ 10 ] . Taken together , these studies indicate that vertebrate Talin1 and Talin2 are differentially expressed during cell differentiation and organismal development and that they function as non - redundant components of distinct adhesion complexes in different cells and tissues . Thus , in both D . discoideum and vertebrates , multiple talins are involved in talin functions . Development in C . intestinalis is a complex , multistage process . Following fertilization and subsequent embryo - genesis , a free - swimming tadpole larva containing a noto - chord , nervous system , and musculature settles upon a solid substrate and metamorphoses into a sessile , filter - feeding organism . The adult contains organs common to other chordates , including a digestive system , heart , and nervous system [ 33 ] . C . intestinalis has only one talin gene , but the existence of the splice variants Talin - a and Talin - b , which vary in the important C - terminal I / LWEQ module [ 13 ] , further supports the emerging paradigm that talin function is due to the actions of distinct proteins , which are expressed at different times and in different places dur - ing chordate development [ 3 , 10 ] . The results presented here suggest that alternative splicing is the means by which two talins with different roles in cell adhesion , and perhaps cell differentiation , are produced from one talin gene in C . intestinalis . Thus , this mechanism may bridge the one - talin bottleneck present in invertebrates between the multicellular amoebozoan D . discoideum [ 34 ] and ver - tebrates [ 3 ] . Further studies at the cellular and molecular levels will identify when and where Talin - a and Talin - b are produced in C . intestinalis , and how they contribute to the assembly and function of adhesion complexes during development of this model organism . Conclusion Taken together with previous studies showing that talin function is due to the activities of distinct proteins , which are differentially expressed and targeted to different adhe - sion complexes in multicellular organisms , our results show that alternative splicing of the C . intestinalis talin mRNA produces two different proteins , Talin - a and Talin - b . These proteins vary in the C - terminal I / LWEQ module , which is critical for talin function . Moreover , these differ - ences lead to different activities of the alternative splice variants . Our data suggest that C . intestinalis Talin - a is involved in cell adhesion and motility in assemblies that are similar to focal adhesions . Identification of the struc - tural determinants responsible for the different properties of Talin - a and Talin - b will expand our knowledge of how different talins are involved in cell adhesion in chordates . Given that C . intestinalis has recently re - emerged as a model for the study of chordate development [ 33 , 35 ] , fur - ther research comparing the roles of Talin - a and Talin - b during C . intestinalis development will also increase our knowledge of how talin functions have evolved during animal evolution . Methods Identification of Talin - a and Talin - b Talin - a and Talin - b cDNAs were identified in BLAST searches [ 36 ] of the GenBank non - human , non - mouse EST database using the C - terminal 250 amino acid sequence of Ciona intestinalis talin [ GenBank : AABS01000025 ] as the query sequence [ 3 ] . Unambiguous Talin - a and Talin - b cDNAs were identified by comparison of the C - terminal protein sequences with the original Talin - a and Talin - b that we identified previously [ 3 ] . Full - length and partial C - terminal chordate talin sequences were aligned with CLUSTAL W [ 19 ] using the European Bioinformatics Institute server as previously described [ 3 ] . Unrooted trees were then calculated from these align - ments using TreeView [ 20 ] . The sequence alignments in BMC Cell Biology 2006 , 7 : 40 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2121 / 7 / 40 Page 9 of 11 ( page number not for citation purposes ) Fig . 2 were prepared for display using MacBoxShade as previously described [ 3 ] . PCR amplification of Talin - a / b from Ciona intestinalis and protein preparation Whole Ciona intestinalis adults were obtained from the Marine Biological Laboratory ( Woods Hole , MA ) . Organ - isms were frozen in liquid nitrogen , pulverized , and homogenized . RNA was extracted using RNAqueous - Midi ( Ambion ) . First strand cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) with 1 μ g total RNA and the oligo dT primer ( 5 ' - GACTCGAGTCGA - CATCGATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT - 3 ' ) . Talin - a / b regions were then amplified by PCR using gene specific primers with the first - strand cDNA as a template : Talin - a / b sense , 5 ' - CCGGAATTCATTTTGGAAGCCGCAAAATCAATCGC - 3 ' Talin - a antisense , 5 ' - CCTGGCGCGCCTTAATCGGATTCA - GAATCATCCTTGT - 3 ' Talin - b antisense , 5 ' - CCTGGCGCGCCCTATTTCTTTTGGTTTTGCTCGTATTTC - 3 ' PCR amplicons were recovered using pCR2 . 1 - TOPO ( Invitrogen ) and then subcloned into pET - 41 ( Novagen ) for production of GST - fusion proteins . The proteins pro - duced correspond to amino acids 2341 – 2531 for both Talin - a and Talin - b . All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing . Recombinant GST fusion proteins were pre - pared as previously described [ 2 , 22 ] . F - Actin Binding Actin was obtained from Cytoskeleton , Inc ( Denver , CO ) . The binding of the I / LWEQ modules of Talin - a and Talin - b to F - actin was determined as previously described [ 2 , 22 ] . Briefly , F - actin co - sedimentation assays were per - formed in buffer A ( 2 m M Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 m M CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 m M ATP , and 0 . 5 m M dithiothreitol ) , keeping the con - centration of GST - Talin - a / b . 2341 – 2531 constant at 4 . 0 μ M while increasing the actin concentration from 0 to 25 μ M in a total volume of 50 μ l . Actin polymerization was induced by addition of 2 m M MgCl 2 and 50 m M KCl and allowed to proceed for 60 minutes at 22°C . The critical concentration for actin polymerization is 0 . 71 μ M under these conditions . Following centrifugation at 160000 g for 20 minutes at 22°C , the supernatant and pellet fractions were separated for subsequent analysis with SDS - PAGE using 12 % gels . Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue G250 . Digital quantification of the cosedimentation data was performed using NIH Image v1 . 62 and binding curves were calculated using GraphPad Prism 4 . 0 as previ - ously described [ 2 , 22 ] . The R 2 values for the binding curves were 0 . 95 for Talin - a and 0 . 99 for Talin - b . Neither GST - Talin - a . 2341 – 2531 nor GST - Talin - b . 2341 – 2531 sed - imented at 160 , 000 g in the absence of F - actin . We have determined previously that the presence of the GST puri - fication tag has no effect on actin binding of I / LWEQ module proteins [ 2 , 22 ] . The concentration of actin was determined using its molar extinction coefficient at 290 nm . The concentrations of GST - Talin - a and GST - Talin - b were determined using the BCA protein assay ( Pierce ) and by calculating the extinction coefficient of each protein [ 37 ] . Immunofluorescence C . intestinalis Talin - a / b I / LWEQ module constructs were subcloned from pET - 41 to pDsRedC2 - monomer ( BD Bio - sciences ) and verified by DNA sequencing . HeLa cells ( American Type Culture Collection CCL - 2 ) were main - tained in Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % FBS , 100 μ g / ml penicillin , 100 μ g / ml streptomycin and 10 μ g / ml gentamicin . Glass cov - erslips were ethanol - washed and coated with 10 μ g / ml fibronectin . HeLa cells were plated on the coverslips in complete growth medium and allowed to adhere for 12 hours . Transfection of HeLa cells was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Cells were transfected with 0 . 8 μ g of DNA and 2 μ l Lipo - fectamine 2000 in normal growth medium for 24 hours . Cells were then fixed with 4 % paraformadehyde , permea - bilized briefly on ice with 1 % Triton X - 100 , and labeled with either anti - vinculin antibody at a dilution of 1 : 300 ( V9131 , Sigma ) or FITC - phalloidin at 1 : 400 dilution as previously described in our analysis of the subcellular tar - geting of mammalian Talin1 [ 13 ] . Fluorescence images were obtained with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope and processed using OpenLab ( Improvision ) . Expression of intact dsRed - Talin - a / b constructs in transfected cells was confirmed in immunoblots using an anti - dsRed polyclo - nal antibody . We have shown previously that the addition of a fluorescence tag to the N - terminus of both full - length talin and talin I / LWEQ module constructs has no effect on the talin subcellular targeting [ 10 , 13 ] . Transfection of HeLa cells with the dsRed vector alone did not affect the morphology of HeLa cells and dsRed protein was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm .

A . Chordate talin sequence alignment . Talin1 and Talin2 from human ( Hs , Homo sapiens ) , chicken ( Gg , Gallus gallus ) , pufferfish ( Tn , Tetraodon nigroviridis ) , and Ciona intestinalis ( Ci Tn - a / b ) were aligned using CLUSTAL W . The T . nigroviridis sequences are from the Genoscope database [ 39 ] and have been annotated manually . The G . gallus Talin2 sequence was compiled manually from the current version of the chicken genome ( GenBank ) . The gap at position 1789 – 1830 corresponds to exon 40 of the human Talin1 / 2 sequences and may represent an unsequenced region of the chicken genome , or chicken Talin2 may lack this exon alto - gether . The insertion at position 12 – 13 shows that C . intestinalis talin is orthologous to vertebrate Talin2 . The I / LWEQ module begins at position 2345 of human Talin1 ( ILEAAK ) . The alternative splice variants of C . intestinalis Talin - a and Talin - b are shown in red . Sequence identity ( * ) ; sequence similarity ( : ) .
