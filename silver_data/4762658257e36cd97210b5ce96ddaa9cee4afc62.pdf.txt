Previous work implicating the receptor for advanced glycation end products ( RAGE ) in atherosclerosis prompted us to explore if Diaphanous 1 ( DIAPH1 ) , which binds to the RAGE cytoplasmic domain and is important for RAGE signaling , contributes to these processes . We intercrossed atherosclerosis - prone Ldlr − / − mice with mice devoid of Diaph1 and fed them Western diet for 16 weeks . Compared to male Ldlr − / − mice , male Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice displayed signi ﬁ cantly less atherosclerosis , in parallel with lower plasma concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides . Female Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice displayed signi ﬁ cantly less atherosclerosis compared to Ldlr − / − mice and demonstrated lower plasma concentrations of cholesterol , but not plasma triglycerides .

Beyond the panoply of lipid - lowering therapies , seminal bene ﬁ ts for lipid - independent anti - in ﬂ ammatory treatments have been demonstrated . In the CANTOS trial , treatment with canakinumab , which targets the interleukin - 1 β pathway , resulted in a signi ﬁ cantly lower rate of recurrent cardiovascular events than placebo 3 . A consequence of targeting this immune pathway was the increased risk for sig - ni ﬁ cant infection , thereby indicating the overall importance of developing effective and safe adjunctive therapies targeting atherosclerosis . Previous work implicating the receptor for advanced glycation end products ( RAGE ) in the progression 4 – 6 and regression of atherosclerosis 7 spurred the current investigation . The cyto - plasmic domain of RAGE binds to the formin Diaphanous 1 ( DIAPH1 ) , through DIAPH1 ’ s formin homology 1 ( FH1 ) domain 8 . This interaction is important for RAGE ligand - stimulated signal transduction 9 , 10 . Formins such as DIAPH1 possess diverse functions relevant to the biology of RAGE , such as F - actin polymerization ; the organization and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton ; cellular migration ; signal transduction through the Rho GTPases ; 11 , 12 and the regulation of RAGE ligand - mediated upregulation of Egr1 ( Early Growth Response 1 ) via serum response factor ( SRF ) in hypoxia , factors which induce expression of proin ﬂ ammatory and prothrombotic factors in oxygen deprivation 13 , 14 . Recently , we showed that transplantation of aortic arches from diabetic Western diet ( WD ) - fed mice devoid of the low - density lipoprotein receptor ( Ldlr ) into diabetic wild - type C57BL / 6 J chow - fed mice devoid of Ager ( the gene encoding RAGE ) or Diaph1 accelerated regression of diabetic atherosclerosis ; in par - allel , we observed reduced donor atherosclerotic lesion content of neutral lipids , macrophages , oxidative stress and RAGE ligand AGEs , and increased lesional collagen content 7 . Importantly , the aforementioned studies solely probed the effects of transplanta - tion of atherosclerosis - laden aortic arches into an environment of diabetes in normolipidemic mice devoid of Diaph1 ; hence , DIAPH1 - dependent mechanisms in the progression of athero - sclerosis have never been explored 7 . For this reason , the current investigation was designed to probe if DIAPH1 contributes to progression of atherosclerosis in Ldlr − / − mice . Here we show that deletion of Diaph1 protected from progression of atherosclerosis in male and female Ldlr − / − mice and we demonstrate an unforeseen role for DIAPH1 in the regulation of cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism . Results DIAPH1 is expressed in human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions . To explore potential roles for DIAPH1 in the progression of atherosclerosis , we began by probing expression of DIAPH1 in atherosclerosis . DIAPH1 was expressed in human atherosclerotic plaques , at least in part in macrophages and smooth muscle cells ( SMCs ) , as illustrated by co - localization of DIAPH1 with CD68 and Smooth Muscle Actin ( SMA ) epitopes ( Supplementary Fig . 1a , b , respectively ) . Analogous to these ﬁ ndings in human atherosclerosis , DIAPH1 was expressed in macrophages and SMCs of atherosclerotic lesions of Ldlr − / − mice fed a WD for 16 weeks ( Supplementary Fig . 1c , d , respectively ) . These results set the stage for testing potential roles for DIAPH1 in athero - sclerosis through utilization of a mouse model . Effect of deletion of Diaph1 in Ldlr − / − mice on atherosclerosis and lesion characteristics . Male mice devoid of the Ldlr and Ldlr − / − mice intercrossed with Diaph1 − / − mice ( C57BL / 6 J background ) were fed WD from age 6 to 22 weeks . After 16 weeks feeding , atherosclerosis was assessed . By en face analysis , Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice displayed lower neutral lipid content in the aorta , p = 0 . 0002 ( Fig . 1a ) . Next , sections were prepared through the aortic arch . Signi ﬁ cantly less atherosclerosis was observed in Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − compared to Ldlr − / − mice , p < 0 . 0001 ( Fig . 1b ) . Neutral lipid content was signi ﬁ cantly lower in the aortic arch atherosclerotic lesions of Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice ; p < 0 . 0001 ( Fig . 1c ) . Lesional macrophage content was signi ﬁ cantly lower in the atherosclerotic plaques of Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice vs . Ldlr − / − mice , p < 0 . 0001 ( Fig . 1d ) . Deletion of Diaph1 resulted in signi ﬁ cantly higher collagen content in the atherosclerotic lesions vs . that observed in Ldlr − / − mice , p < 0 . 0001 ( Fig . 1e ) . As RAGE and DIAPH1 mediate oxidative and in ﬂ ammatory stress 15 , which regulate expression of RAGE and RAGE ligands such as AGEs 16 , we determined if deletion of Diaph1 affected the expression of the ligand - RAGE axis . These investigations revealed that both AGEs and RAGE expression were signi ﬁ cantly lower in the lesions of Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice , p < 0 . 0001 and p = 0 . 0289 , respectively ( Supple - mentary Fig . 1e , f ) . We studied a distinct cohort of male mice to assess for the effects of Diaph1 deletion on atherosclerosis in the Ldlr − / − background at a different anatomical location , the aortic sinus . As illustrated in Supplementary Fig . 2a , male Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice fed WD for 16 weeks displayed signi ﬁ cantly less athero - sclerosis compared to Ldlr − / − mice ; p = 0 . 0144 . In addition to examination of male mice , we performed studies in female mice and found that female Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice fed WD for 16 weeks displayed signi ﬁ cantly less atherosclerosis at the aortic sinus compared to female Ldlr − / − mice ; p = 0 . 0454 ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 2b ) . Effect of deletion of Diaph1 in Ldlr − / − mice on in ﬂ ammation . To begin to account for the mechanisms underlying these dif - ferences in atherosclerosis upon global deletion of Diaph1 , we performed studies to determine the state of in ﬂ ammation in these mice . First , we performed ﬂ ow cytometry on the aortic arches of male Ldlr − / − vs . Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice fed WD for 16 – 18 weeks to characterize macrophage phenotypes . These studies revealed that there were no signi ﬁ cant genotype - dependent differences in the percentage of “ pro - in ﬂ amma - tory ” markers in macrophages , Ly6C and CD14 . Similarly , there were no signi ﬁ cant genotype - dependent differences in the percentage of “ anti - in ﬂ ammatory ” markers in macrophages , CD206 and CD163 ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , b and Supple - mentary Table 1 ) . Second , we probed for mRNA expression of genes related to in ﬂ ammation in the aortas of male mice . mRNA transcripts encoding pro - in ﬂ ammatory Nos2 and Tnfa were signi ﬁ cantly lower in Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice ( p < 0 . 0001 and p = 0 . 0006 , respectively ) and transcripts encoding anti - in ﬂ ammatory Il10 and Arg1 were signi ﬁ cantly higher in Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice ( p = 0 . 0167 and p = 0 . 0006 , respectively ) ( Supplementary Fig . 4a – d ) . However , no differences were observed in the mRNA expression of Ccl2 ( p = 0 . 2171 ) ( Supplementary Fig . 4e ) . Third , we explored if systemic in ﬂ ammation was affected by DIAPH1 expression in these mice . There were no signi ﬁ cant differences in plasma concentrations of TNF - alpha or IL6 in Ldlr − / − vs . Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − male mice , p = 0 . 2314 and p = 0 . 8643 , respectively . ( Supplementary Fig . 4f , g ) . Taken together , these data highlight complex effects of Diaph1 deletion in Ldlr − / − mice on measures of in ﬂ ammation ; whereas there were no differences in the relative content of ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 023 - 04643 - 2 2 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2023 ) 6 : 280 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 023 - 04643 - 2 | www . nature . com / commsbio “ pro - ” vs . “ anti - “ in ﬂ ammatory macrophages within the aortic arch or in plasma concentrations of TNF - alpha or IL6 , altered mRNA transcript expression of markers of in ﬂ ammation was noted in the aortas compared to Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice . However , mRNA expression of Ccl2 did not differ by genotype in the aortas . Hence , we next sought to test if DIAPH1 affected concentrations of lipids in Ldlr − / − mice to uncover mechan - isms related to atherosclerosis .

We examined the concentrations of cholesterol and triglyceride in Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice to determine if modulation of lipid pro ﬁ le contributes to the observed differences in atherosclerosis . We retrieved plasma after 16 weeks WD feeding and ﬁ ve hours ( h ) fasting and observed that plasma cholesterol concentrations were signi ﬁ cantly lower in male Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice ( 983 ± 66 . 6 mg / dl ) vs . Ldlr − / − mice ( 1 , 390 . 8 ± 35 . 4 mg / dl , respectively ) , p < 0 . 0001 ( Fig . 2a ) . Similarly , the concentrations of plasma triglyceride were signi ﬁ cantly lower in male Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice ( 77 . 4 ± 13 . 8 mg / dl ) vs . Ldlr − / − mice ( 102 . 2 ± 20 . 7 mg / dl ) , p = 0 . 0057 ( Fig . 2b ) . In contrast , there were no differences in plasma concentrations of high - density lipo - protein cholesterol ( HDL - C ) between genotypes , p = 0 . 8759 ( Fig . 2c ) . We performed fast performance liquid chromatography ( FPLC ) to establish the nature of the cholesterol particles that accounted for these differences and found that the majority of the reduction in Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice was observed in the very low - density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) and low - density lipo - protein ( LDL ) fractions , whereas no differences were observed in the HDL fractions ( Fig . 2d ) . In light of the observation that female Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice also displayed signi ﬁ cantly less atherosclerosis than female Ldlr − / − mice , we examined the plasma concentrations of cholesterol and triglyceride . We found that plasma concentra - tions of cholesterol were signi ﬁ cantly lower in female Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice ( 604 . 3 ± 21 . 7 vs . 1094 . 0 ± 84 . 1 mg / dl ; p < 0 . 0001 ) ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . However , in contrast to the ﬁ ndings in male mice , there were no signi ﬁ cant differences in plasma concentrations of triglyceride in female Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice ( 99 . 9 ± 10 . 6 vs . 116 . 9 ± 17 . 0 mg / dl ; p = 0 . 3690 ) ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Furthermore , there were no genotype - dependent differences in body weight or plasma concentrations of glucose in the female mice , p > 0 . 05 ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Deletion of Diaph1 in male Ldlr − / − mice reduces hepatic lipid concentrations . To probe DIAPH1 - dependent mechanisms in lipid metabolism , we turned our focus to the liver , as it is a major organ responsible for the regulation of lipid metabolism . DIAPH1 is expressed in the liver of Ldlr − / − mice but not Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice fed WD ; p = 0 . 0024 ( Fig . 3a ) . In normal mouse liver , hepatocytes demonstrated expression of DIAPH1 ( arrow - heads , Supplementary Fig . 5a , left panel ) ; cholangiocytes of the bile ducts ( BD ) , sinusoidal mononuclear cells and endothelial cells of the hepatic artery ( HA ) also expressed DIAPH1 ( arrows , Supplementary Fig . 5a , left panel ) . Control sections with omission of the primary anti - DIAPH1 antibody revealed the absence of staining ( Supplementary Fig . 5a , right panel ) . In normal human liver , hepatocytes also demonstrated cytoplasmic staining for DIAPH1 and linear dark staining of hepatocyte apical ( canalicular ) membranes . Dot - like cross - sections of canaliculi were noted ( long arrows , Supplementary Fig . 5b , left panel ) . Some hepatocytes also showed typical features such as intracytoplasmic lipid and binucleation ( * and arrow - heads , respectively , Supplementary Fig . 5b , left panel ) . Some mononuclear cells in the sinusoids also showed strong cytoplas - mic DIAPH1 staining , but sinusoidal endothelial staining was not noted ( Supplementary Fig . 5b , left panel ) . Furthermore , human bile ducts ( BD ) showed cytoplasmic staining for DIAPH1 , as did nearby hepatocytes . Endothelial cells of portal veins ( PV ) and hepatic artery ( HA ) and mononuclear cells within the portal tract also revealed staining for DIAPH1 ( Supplementary Fig . 5b , Fig . 2 Effect of DIAPH1 on lipid parameters .

Control sections with omission of the primary anti - DIAPH1 antibody revealed the absence of staining ( Supple - mentary Fig . 5b , right panel ) . Having established that DIAPH1 was expressed in the liver , at least in part in hepatocytes , we probed for the effects of Diaph1 deletion in this organ . In the livers of WD - fed male Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice , histological analysis revealed a signi ﬁ cantly lower neutral lipid content , p < 0 . 0001 ( Fig . 3b ) . The concentrations of free and total cholesterol in the liver were also signi ﬁ cantly lower in Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice , p = 0 . 0002 and p = 0 . 0056 , respectively ( Fig . 3c , d ) .

Ldlr − / − mice , p = 0 . 0259 ( Fig . 3e ) . Hepatic collagen content was signi ﬁ cantly lower in Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice , p = 0 . 0035 ( Fig . 3f ) and liver weight was signi ﬁ cantly lower in Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice , p = 0 . 0003 ( Fig . 3g ) . There were no signi ﬁ cant differences in plasma concentrations of alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , total protein ( TP ) , albumin ( ALB ) , albumin / globulin ratio ( A / G ) or total bilirubin ( TBIL ) ( Supplementary Fig . 5 c – g , i , j ) . Only plasma globulin ( GLOB ) concentrations were signi ﬁ cantly lower in Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice , p = 0 . 0247 ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 5h ) . Collectively , these data demonstrate that deletion of Diaph1 in male Ldlr − / − mice resulted in signi ﬁ cantly lower concentrations of hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride and lower hepatic mass , ﬁ brosis and lipid deposition compared to that observed in Ldlr − / − mice expressing Diaph1 . RNA - Sequencing revealed that DIAPH1 plays roles in hepatic lipid metabolism . To identify the basis of the effect of Diaph1 deletion on cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism , we per - formed bulk RNA - sequencing ( RNAseq ) on the liver tissue of male Ldlr − / − and Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice . Mice were fed WD for 16 weeks and livers were removed after a 5 h fast . A total of 468 genes was differentially expressed with p - value ≤ 0 . 05 and false discovery rate ( FDR ) ≤ 0 . 05 . A dendrogram and heatmap of these genes is shown in Fig . 4a and the list of the differentially expressed genes is shown in Supplementary data 6 . Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) indicated “ Gly - cerophospholipid Metabolism ” as among the top differentially regulated pathways ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Reactome pathway analysis ( FDR < 0 . 05 ) revealed that the top candidate pathway was “ Metabolism ; ” this pathway included multiple differentially expressed genes comparing Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . Notably , a number of genes within the “ Metabolism ” pathway were linked to lipid metabolism . An additional 49 Reactome pathways met statistical signi ﬁ cance in this data set ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . Of these additional path - ways , at least 17 were related to lipid metabolism . All of the genes highlighted from the Reactome pathway met the criterion of p < 0 . 05 . In agreement with the above results , the Gene Ontology ( GO ) pathway analysis linked DIAPH1 with lipid metabolism as well , identifying pathways such as “ Fatty Acid catabolic process , ” “ Lysophospholipid transport , ” and “ Vesicle - mediated cholesterol transport ” ( Supplementary Table 6 ) . We next undertook an in - depth analysis of these data to identify putative mechanisms underlying the effects of Diaph1 on cholesterol and lipid metabolism . With respect to lipid uptake , RNAseq data revealed no signi ﬁ cant differences in the mRNA transcripts encoding the fatty acid transporter Cd36 ( Supple - mentary data 6 ) ; although fatty acid binding protein 7 , Fabp7 , was identi ﬁ ed as one of the differentially - expressed genes , its expression was higher in the livers of Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice fed WD ( Supplementary data 6 ) , thus not likely accounting for the observed differences in plasma and hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations between genotypes . There were no differences in expression of genes regulating hepatic fatty acid oxidation , such as Ppara , Cpt1 , Cpt2 , Ucp2 , Acadl , or Acadm ( Supplementary data 6 ) . RNAseq revealed that there were no differences in expression of genes regulating Importins and Scap , which have been ascribed roles in the processing and cellular transport of Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Proteins ( SREBPs ) 17 ( Supplementary data 6 ) . Despite signi ﬁ cant differences in plasma and hepatic concentrations of cholesterol in Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice , RNAseq revealed no signi ﬁ cant differences in the expression of the genes linked to cholesterol biosynthesis 18 . We performed reverse transcription ( RT ) quantitative PCR ( RT - qPCR ) analysis on select genes implicated in multiple facets of lipid metabolism using liver tissue retrieved from a distinct cohort of Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − and Ldlr − / − mice fed WD for 16 weeks . First , as shown in Fig . 4b , consistent with the RNAseq data , mRNA transcripts encoding Lpin1 and Lpin2 were signi ﬁ cantly lower in the livers of Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice , p = 0 . 0015 and p = 0 . 0285 , respectively . Genes related to “ fatty acid biosynthesis , ” including acetyl co - A carboxylase enzymes , Acaca and Acacb ; glycerol - 3 - phosphate acyltransferase , Gpat2 , and fatty acid synthase , Fasn , were signi ﬁ cantly lower in Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − livers , p = 0 . 0013 , p = 0 . 0029 , p = 0 . 0179 and p = 0 . 0127 , respectively ( Fig . 4b ) . Second , as shown in Fig . 4c , we veri ﬁ ed the RNAseq ﬁ ndings and found no signi ﬁ cant differences in genes regulating “ cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism ” , including the transcription factors Srebf1 , Srebf2 , Rxra , Nrlh2 ( encodes LXR β ) , and Nrlh3 ( encodes LXR α ) . With respect to genes in the Peroxisome Proliferator - Activated Receptor ( PPAR ) transcription factor family , RT - qPCR experiments con ﬁ rmed that there were no differences in Ppargc1a and Ppard in Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − livers ( Fig . 4c ) . In the context of lipid secretion and transport , there were no signi ﬁ cant differences in triglyceride and cholesterol transporters such as Mttp , Abca1 , or Abcg1 , which con ﬁ rmed the RNAseq ﬁ ndings ( Fig . 4c ) . Further , we assessed triglyceride secretion in vivo in chow - fed Ldlr − / − and Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice . After an overnight fast , mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of [ 35 S ] methionine / cysteine labeling mixture combined with pluronic F127 polox - amer - 407 , the latter to inhibit lipoprotein clearance from plasma . When comparing Ldlr − / − vs . Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice , there were no signi ﬁ cant differences in triglyceride secretion or secretion of apolipoprotein B100 ( apoB100 ) or apolipoprotein B48 ( apoB 48 ) into the plasma ( Supplementary Fig . 6a – c ) . Collectively , these data indicate that deletion of Diaph1 in Ldlr − / − mice downregulated key genes implicated in hepatic lipid metabolism , without affecting the mRNA expression of upstream regulatory transcription factors such as Srebf1 , Srebf2 or Mxlipl , which encode sterol and carbohydrate regulatory element binding proteins , SREBP1 , SREBP2 and Carbohydrate Response Element Binding Protein ( ChREBP ) , respectively . Nuclear content of SREBP1 , SREBP2 and ChREBP is reduced upon deletion of Diaph1 in Ldlr − / − mice . SREBP1 , SREBP2 , and ChREBP are central regulators of cholesterol , triglyceride and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways 19 . As RNAseq data illustrated that numerous Srebf1 / Srebf2 or Mlxipl - dependent genes were downregulated in the livers of Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice , we hypothesized that DIAPH1 affects the activity of these transcription factors independently of changes in their mRNA expression . To test this premise , we prepared cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from the livers of Ldlr − / − mice expressing or devoid of Diaph1 . There were no signi ﬁ cant differences in cyto - plasmic SREBP1 , SREBP2 or ChREBP ( normalized to GAPDH ) ( Fig . 5a , b ) . In contrast , nuclear SREBP1 , SREBP2 and ChREBP ( normalized to Lamin A / C ) were signi ﬁ cantly lower in Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice vs . Ldlr − / − mice livers , p = 0 . 0173 , p = 0 . 0221 and p = 0 . 0260 , respectively ( Fig . 5a , c ) . Importantly , total SREBP1 protein expression , normalized to tubulin , did not differ in the livers of Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice ; p = 0 . 4979 ( Fig . 5d ) . To determine if deletion of Diaph1 in mice devoid of Ldlr affected other transcription factors related to metabolism , we probed for CEBP α content and found that cytoplasmic or nuclear ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 023 - 04643 - 2 6 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2023 ) 6 : 280 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 023 - 04643 - 2 | www . nature . com / commsbio amounts of this factor did not signi ﬁ cantly differ between Ldlr − / − vs . Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − livers , p = 0 . 5848 and p = 0 . 6683 , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 7a – c ) . Collectively , these data suggested that DIAPH1 had no effect on total levels of SREBP1 in the liver but that DIAPH1 - dependent effects on nuclear content of SREBP1 , SREBP2 and ChREBP appeared to be independent of the mRNA transcripts encoding these factors . Effect of Diaph1 deletion in Ldlr − / − mice on metabolic factors . As nuclear translocation of the transcription factors SREBP1 , SREBP2 and ChREBP may be regulated by metabolic pathways , we investigated multiple factors related to body mass and com - position , and glucose / carbohydrate and insulin metabolism . With respect to body mass and composition , Ldlr − / − mice devoid of Diaph1 weighed modestly but signi ﬁ cantly less than Fig . 4 RNA - Sequencing reveals roles for DIAPH1 in regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism .

Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice , p > 0 . 05 ( Supplementary Table 7 ) . Collectively , these data suggested that DIAPH1 - dependent effects on nuclear content of SREBP1 , SREBP2 and ChREBP appeared to be independent of classical insulin - and glucose / carbohydrate - related metabolic factors . DIAPH1 contributes to atherosclerosis at least in part through effects on lipid not carbohydrate metabolism in Ldlr − / − mice . To provide further insight into the question of whether DIAPH1 - dependent roles in atherosclerosis were mediated through reg - ulation of lipid vs . glucose / carbohydrate or insulin metabolism , we performed a series of correlation analyses . In male Ldlr − / − and Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice , atherosclerotic lesion area was signi ﬁ cantly correlated with lesion neutral lipid content , 0 . 80 ( p = 0 . 0057 ) and 0 . 84 ( p = 0 . 0026 ) , respectively ( Supplementary Table 8a , left ) and atherosclerotic lesion area was signi ﬁ cantly correlated with lesion macrophage content in both Ldlr − / − and Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice , 0 . 93 ( p = 0 . 00028 ) and 0 . 78 ( p = 0 . 0134 ) , respectively ( Supplementary Table 8b , left ) . Further , atherosclerotic lesion neutral lipid content was signi ﬁ cantly associated with macrophage content in Ldlr − / − and Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice , 0 . 93 ( p = 0 . 0003 ) and 0 . 82 ( p = 0 . 0068 ) , respectively ( Supplementary Table 8c , left ) . We tested the associations between the plasma concentrations of cholesterol and triglyceride with atherosclerosis and lesion characteristics . In both Ldlr − / − and Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice , the concentrations of plasma cholesterol signi ﬁ cantly correlated with atherosclerotic lesion area ( 0 . 83 and 0 . 86 ) , lesion neutral lipid content ( 0 . 93 and 0 . 97 ) and lesion macrophage content ( 0 . 84 and 0 . 92 ) , respectively , p < 0 . 01 ( Supplementary Table 8d – f , left ) . In contrast , in Ldlr − / − and Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice , the concen - trations of plasma triglyceride did not signi ﬁ cantly correlate with atherosclerotic lesion area ( 0 . 53 and 0 . 0183 ) , lesion neutral lipid content ( 0 . 51 and 0 . 22 ) and lesion macrophage content ( 0 . 36 and 0 . 10 ) , respectively , p > 0 . 05 ( Supplementary Table 8g – i , left ) . Furthermore , in Ldlr − / − and Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice , there were no signi ﬁ cant associations between atherosclerotic lesion area and concentrations of glucose ( − 0 . 09 and 0 . 37 ) or insulin ( − 0 . 43 and − 0 . 35 ) , respectively , p > 0 . 05 ( Supplementary Table 8j , k , left ) . We performed similar analyses in female mice , as illustrated in Supplementary Table 9 . The concentrations of plasma cholesterol did not signi ﬁ cantly correlate with atherosclerotic lesion area in female Ldlr − / − mice ( − 0 . 12 ; p = 0 . 7755 ) , but did signi ﬁ cantly correlate with atherosclerotic lesion area in the Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice ( 0 . 70 ; p = 0 . 0364 ) . As in male mice , the concentrations of plasma triglyceride did not correlate with atherosclerotic lesion area in either Ldlr − / − or Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice ( 0 . 003 ; p = 0 . 9948 ) and ( 0 . 20 ; p = 0 . 6105 ) , respectively . Similarly , analogous to male mice , in female mice , plasma concentrations of glucose did not correlate with atherosclerotic lesion area in Ldlr − / − or Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice ( − 0 . 05 ; p = 0 . 8955 ) and ( 0 . 43 ; p = 0 . 2522 ) , respectively ( Supplementary Table 9 ) . Collectively , these data suggested that lipid ( cholesterol ) - driven and not glycemia - or insulin - related mechanisms appeared more likely to contribute to athero - sclerosis in these mice . However , these correlation analyses did not discern if there were speci ﬁ c roles for DIAPH1 in these processes . Hence , we speci ﬁ cally queried if the deletion of Diaph1 in Ldlr − / − male mice exerted more prominent effects on the associations with atherosclerosis through lipid or glucose / insulin - related factors when compared to Ldlr − / − mice . To address this point , we tested if the change in the slope of the lines generated from each set of compared parameters in Supplementary Table 8 was more relevant when comparing male Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice . We found that the only genotypic dependence which was signi ﬁ cant , both statistically and in terms of effect size , was the dependence of atherosclerotic lesion area on the concentration of plasma cholesterol , p = 0 . 0082 ( Supplementary Table 8d , right and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . The increase of atherosclerotic lesion area per unit plasma cholesterol in Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice was approximately one - third of its value in Ldlr − / − mice . This result implies that about two - thirds of the effect of cholesterol on atherosclerotic lesion formation appears to occur through DIAPH1 . Analogous ﬁ ndings were demonstrated in female mice ; as shown in Supplementary Table 9 ( right ) , the only signi ﬁ cant genotype - dependent factor ( Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − ) in female mice was the dependence of atherosclerotic lesion area on the concentration of plasma cholesterol ( p = 0 . 0224 ) , but not on the plasma concentrations of triglyceride or glucose . Effects of deletion of Diaph1 in Ldlr − / − mice on signal transduction regulatory factors . On account of the evidence linking DIAPH1 to atherosclerosis through lipid metabolism , we examined potential signaling pathways by which DIAPH1 might regulate nuclear translocation of SREBP1 , SREBP2 and ChREBP in the livers of the mice under study . First , phosphorylation of AKT has been shown to stimulate nuclear translocation of SREBP1 and SREBP2 20 . We found that the phosphorylated ( Ser473 ) AKT / total AKT was signi ﬁ cantly higher in the livers of Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice , p = 0 . 0341 ( Supplementary Fig . 9a , c ) , which is in disagreement with our ﬁ ndings that the nuclear SREBP1 , SREBP2 and ChREBP were lower in the livers of the Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice . AKT - related regulation of SREBPs and lipogenesis has been shown to be potentially regulated by mTORC1 pathways 21 . However , there were no sig - ni ﬁ cant differences in phosphorylated ( Ser2448 ) mTOR / total mTOR or its downstream target , phosphorylated ( Ser240 / 244 ) S6 / total S6 , respectively , when comparing Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − and Ldlr − / − livers , p = 0 . 2857 and p = 0 . 5905 , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 9a , d , e ) . Furthermore , phosphorylated AMPK α has been shown to affect SREBP nuclear translocation ; 22 we found that there were no differences in phosphorylated ( Thr172 ) AMPK / total AMPK in Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − Fig . 5 Deletion of Diaph1 in Ldlr − / − mice reduces nuclear content of SREBP1 , SREBP2 and ChREBP in liver .

Overall , these ﬁ ndings indicated that signal transduction pathways responsive to metabolic cues were not signi ﬁ cantly different when comparing Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − livers in a manner that would support differences in nuclear translocation of SREBPs or ChREBP . Reduced nuclear content of SREBP1 , SREBP2 and ChREBP upon deletion of Diaph1 in Ldlr − / − mice and relationship to ROCK , LIMK1 , Co ﬁ lin pathway . Until this point , multiple data described above do not implicate DIAPH1 directly in the classical metabolic factors or signaling pathways that regulate nuclear translocation of SREBP1 , SREBP2 and ChREBP , that is , AKT , mTOR / S6 and AMPK pathways . These considerations suggested that distinct DIAPH1 - dependent pathways likely regulate the nuclear translocation of these key transcription factors . Accordingly , review of the GO and Reactome pathways highlighted multiple DIAPH1 - dependent pathways linked to protein localization , actin cytoskeleton and overall protein transport ( Supplementary Tables 5 , 6 ) . Previous work high - lighted roles for the ROCK - LIMK - Co ﬁ lin pathway in nuclear translocation of the SREBPs induced by shear stress 23 . Hence , we probed for these factors in the livers of the mice under study and found that there were no signi ﬁ cant differences in ROCK1 or phosphorylated ( Thr508 ) LIMK1 / total LIMK1 in Ldlr − / − vs . Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − liver tissue , p = 0 . 0800 and p = 0 . 6789 , respectively . However , phosphorylated ( Ser3 ) Co ﬁ lin / total Co ﬁ lin was signi ﬁ cantly higher in the livers of Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice , p = 0 . 0013 ( Fig . 6a – e ) . Note that our studies examine Co ﬁ lin1 , and not Co ﬁ lin2 , as the expres - sion of the latter is restricted to striated muscle 24 and that our RNAseq studies did not reveal differences in expression of the genes encoding Co ﬁ lin 1 or 2 ( C ﬂ 1 or C ﬂ 2 ) ( Supplementary data 6 ) . To determine if Slingshot1 ( SSH1 ) , a phosphatase linked to regulation of phosphorylation of Co ﬁ lin 25 might account for these differences , we probed for this factor in the livers of the mice under study ; no differences in phosphorylated ( Ser978 ) SSH1 / total SSH1 were observed between genotypes , p = 0 . 2270 ( Fig . 6a , f ) . In addition , RNAseq results from the livers of Ldlr − / − vs . Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice revealed that expression of Ctsd which encodes Cathepsin D and is linked to regulation of phosphorylation of Co ﬁ lin 26 , also did not differ ( Supplementary data 6 ) . To determine if DIAPH1 - dependent phosphorylation of Co ﬁ lin was unique to the liver , we assessed the phosphorylation status in the whole aorta and found that phosphorylated Co ﬁ lin ( Ser3 ) / total Co ﬁ lin was also signi ﬁ cantly higher in the aortas of Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice , p = 0 . 0399 . ( Supplementary Fig . 10a , c ) . Collectively , these data suggested that in two different organs , liver and aorta , the expression of DIAPH1 was associated with the phosphorylation state of Co ﬁ lin 1 . As roles for phosphorylation of Co ﬁ lin have been ascribed to the regulation of actin polymerization 27 – 29 , these ﬁ ndings pointed us to new directions for probing DIAPH1 - dependent mechanisms in the regulation of the nuclear translocation of the transcription factors under study .

As the phosphorylation state of Co ﬁ lin is linked to actin polymerization , we hypothesized that silencing Diaph1 in Hepa 1 - 6 cells might modulate F - actin intensity . We silenced Diaph1 as illustrated in Hepa 1 - 6 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . Compared to scr control , silencing of Diaph1 signi ﬁ cantly reduced F - actin intensity by Phalloidin staining , which re ﬂ ects the extent of F - actin polymerization , p = 0 . 0267 ( Fig . 7g ) . As these studies in Fig . 7g indicated that DIAPH1 contributes to F - actin polymerization in Hepa 1 - 6 cells , we next probed if silencing of Diaph1 in Hepa 1 - 6 cells directly affected nuclear translocation of the transcription factors under study . We employed 2 - hydroxypropyl - β - cyclodextrin ( HPCD ) with its sterol chelating properties to elicit nuclear translocation of these factors in the cell - based model 30 . Of note , in Hepa 1 - 6 cells we were unable to detect SREBP2 . Silencing of Diaph1 signi ﬁ cantly reduced nuclear translocation of SREBP1 induced by HPCD compared to scramble control , p = 0 . 0443 , but had no effect on nuclear translocation of ChREBP , p = 0 . 9659 ( Fig . 8a , b ) . Hence , we focused our next experiments on SREBP1 . As actin organization has been demonstrated to regulate gene transcription 31 , we tested if nuclear translocation of SREBP1 was linked to the modulation of actin organization in Hepa 1 - 6 Fig . 8 RAGE , DIAPH1 , actin organization and SREBP1 . a Western blots for the detection of nuclear DIAPH1 , ChREBP and SREBP1 performed on mouse Hepa 1 - 6 cells after Diaph1 or scramble control siRNA knockdown and 30 - min sterol depletion with 1 % 2 - hydroxypropyl - β - cyclodextrin ( HPCD ) . b Quanti ﬁ cation of nuclear DIAPH1 , SREBP1 , and ChREBP , relative to Lamin A / C . c Western blots for the detection of nuclear SREBP1 performed on mouse Hepa 1 - 6 cells after 30 min pre - treatment with latrunculin B ( LatB ; 1 µ m ) followed by the addition for 30 min of sterol depletion with 1 % HPCD . d Quanti ﬁ cation of nuclear SREBP1 relative to Lamin A / C . e mRNA expression of the gene encoding RAGE ( Ager ) was determined in the livers of the indicated male mice after 16 weeks WD . f Hepa 1 - 6 cells bearing scramble control or Diaph1 siRNA silencing were treated with RAGE ligand CML - AGE ( 100 µ g / ml ) or vehicle for 6 h followed by quanti ﬁ cation of the mean intensity of F - actin ( phalloidin ) .

ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 023 - 04643 - 2 12 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2023 ) 6 : 280 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 023 - 04643 - 2 | www . nature . com / commsbio cells . To test this premise , we treated DIAPH1 - expressing Hepa 1 - 6 cells with HPCD in the presence of latrunculin - B , which reduces F - actin polymerization 32 and found that compared to treatment of Hepa 1 - 6 cells with HPCD and vehicle , treatment of these cells with HPCD and latrunculin - D signi ﬁ cantly attenuated nuclear content of SREBP1 ; p = 0 . 0039 ( Fig . 8c , d ) . To address potential mechanisms by which DIAPH1 con - tributes to actin polymerization in the livers of mice with atherosclerosis , we probed for involvement of the RAGE pathway in Ldlr − / − mice fed WD for 16 weeks . First , consistent with roles for RAGE in DIAPH1 - dependent mechanisms , we found that mRNA expression of Ager was signi ﬁ cantly lower in the livers of the Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice vs . the Ldlr − / − mice fed WD for 16 weeks , p = 0 . 0101 ( Fig . 8e ) . Second , we note that previous studies demonstrated that the ligands of RAGE accumulate in atherosclerosis 7 and that RAGE ligands induce the formation of RAGE homodimers on the cell surface , which results in the recruitment of DIAPH1 33 . On account of these considerations , we tested if RAGE ligands induced F - actin polymerization and if DIAPH1 was required . As shown in Fig . 8f , treatment of Hepa 1 - 6 cells bearing scr si with RAGE ligand carboxymethyllysine ( CML ) - advanced glycation end product ( AGE ) for 6 h resulted in a signi ﬁ cant increase in F - actin polymerization compared to vehicle ( Veh ) treatment , p = 0 . 0001 . However , in Diaph1 - silenced Hepa 1 - 6 cells treated with CML - AGE , signi ﬁ cantly less F - actin polymerization was noted compared with scr si cells treated with CML - AGE , p = 0 . 0187 ( Fig . 8f ) . Collectively , these data link RAGE ligands to induction of actin polymerization , at least in part through DIAPH1 . Discussion DIAPH1 is a large complex molecule whose multiple functions are mediated through its distinct domains 34 . Among these mul - tiple functions , the formin homology 1 ( FH1 ) domain of DIAPH1 9 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of RAGE . As RAGE has been extensively studied in atherosclerosis , here we sought to test potential roles for DIAPH1 in vascular pathology . Through multiple experimental strategies , this work identi ﬁ ed that deletion of Diaph1 in atherosclerosis - prone mice protected from pro - gression of atherosclerosis and uncovered unanticipated roles for DIAPH1 in the regulation of lipid metabolism . Although this work identi ﬁ ed that deletion of Diaph1 reduced hepatic expres - sion of genes such as Acaca , Acacb , Gpat2 , Lpin1 , Lpin2 and Fasn in Ldlr − / − mice , it was surprising that the mRNA transcripts encoding the master transcriptional regulators of cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism , such as Srebf1 , Srebf2 , and Mlxipl , as well as genes regulating expression of the PPAR family ( Ppargc1a and Ppard ) and the LXR family ( Nrlh2 and Nrlh3 ) , did not differ in the livers of Ldlr − / − mice expressing or devoid of Diaph1 . In contrast , although there were no differences detected at the mRNA level , studies in the mouse liver underscored that nuclear content of SREBP1 , SREBP2 and ChREBP proteins was reduced upon deletion of Diaph1 . Yet , our data suggested that these processes did not appear to be predominantly regulated by clas - sical metabolic factors that may affect the activities of these transcription factors , such as glucose , carbohydrate or insulin pathways . Indeed , the plasma concentrations of glucose , glucagon and insulin , and their correspondingly regulated signaling path - ways , such as AKT , mTOR and AMPK 20 – 22 , which may govern the activities of the SREBPs and ChREBP , did not differ by DIAPH1 expression status . Furthermore , although body mass was modestly but signi ﬁ cantly lower in male Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice , in female Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice , there were no differences in body mass ; in both cases , however , the mice devoid of both the Ldlr and Diaph1 displayed signi ﬁ cantly less atherosclerosis and lower plasma concentrations of cholesterol vs . the Ldlr − / − mice . Nevertheless , we acknowledge that subtle differences in body mass and composition may have contributed to the observed differences in atherosclerosis and lipid metabolism and that studies using distinct Diaph1 - tissue targeted deleted mice will be required to fully dissect these relative contributions . Previous studies in endothelial cells linked the RHO - ROCK - LIMK - Co ﬁ lin pathway to nuclear translocation of SREBPs and ChREBP ; however , the proximate mechanisms were not identi ﬁ ed 23 . Here , in both liver tissue and in mouse Hepa 1 - 6 cells , the present work revealed that genetic deletion or silencing of Diaph1 , respectively , resulted in signi ﬁ cantly higher phos - phorylated ( Ser3 ) Co ﬁ lin / total Co ﬁ lin compared to the respective controls . Co ﬁ lin , an actin binding molecule , plays key roles in actin cytoskeleton organization ; yet , its biology is complex . Co ﬁ lin may bind to F - actin and G - actin and has been implicated in both elongation vs . severing of actin ﬁ laments 27 – 29 . In general , the phosphorylation of Co ﬁ lin is linked to its inactivation 35 . As F - actin binding suppresses phosphorylation of Co ﬁ lin Ser3 36 , 37 , reduced F - actin , which was demonstrated by deletion / silencing of Diaph1 , should cause increased phosphorylation of Co ﬁ lin . This is exactly what was observed in our studies in Hepa 1 - 6 cells . Hence , although we acknowledge that next studies must deter - mine the precise biophysical relationships between DIAPH1 , Co ﬁ lin and actin , and between DIAPH1 , phosphorylated ( Ser3 ) Co ﬁ lin and actin , the work presented in this manuscript , never - theless , suggests new insights into contributory roles for RAGE ligands , DIAPH1 and actin cytoskeleton organization in mechanisms linked to nuclear translocation of SREBP1 . Indeed , precedent for roles for actin organization on nuclear translocation of transcription factors has been demonstrated but the full scope of the upstream regulators of these processes has yet to be identi ﬁ ed . Speci ﬁ cally , phosphorylated ( Ser3 ) Co ﬁ lin med - iates Angiotensin II - stimulated nuclear translocation of NF - kB ( p65 ) in HK2 cells 38 . In other studies , actin organization and Co ﬁ lin phosphorylation were linked to nuclear translocation of transcription factors beyond SREBPs and ChREBPs , such as NF - kB and Serum Response Factors complexes 39 , 40 . The complexity of Co ﬁ lin phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of tran - scription factors was underscored by studies in T cells in which phosphorylated ( Ser3 ) Co ﬁ lin was associated with suppression of nuclear translocation of NF - kB components 41 . These ﬁ ndings in T cells are directly analogous to those identi ﬁ ed in the present work , suggesting that deletion of Diaph1 in liver or in Hepa1 - 6 cells was associated with increased phosphorylation of Co ﬁ lin and suppression of nuclear translocation of SREBPs . Certainly , these intricacies of the phosphorylation state of Co ﬁ lin and nuclear translocation ( or not ) of various transcription factors suggests ﬁ nely - tuned cell type - and stress - dependent regulation of these processes . As noted above , in - depth biophysical studies will be required to further probe these complex mechanisms . With respect to implications for the RAGE pathway in DIAPH1 - dependent regulation of F - actin polymerization , it is important to note that previous studies linked S100A8 / A9 ( ligands of RAGE ) to phosphorylation of Co ﬁ lin in MDA - MB - 231 breast cancers through RAGE , as revealed in experiments with silencing of AGER 42 . In that study , although the content of phospho - Co ﬁ lin was not normalized to total Co ﬁ lin , the authors did suggest that RAGE ligands contributed to activation of NF - kB and epithelial - mesenchymal transition through actin poly - merization pathways 42 . Hence , it will be important to address if / how RAGE ligands / RAGE , DIAPH1 and Co ﬁ lin act in concert or independently to regulate nuclear translocation of transcription factors . It is , however , acknowledged that factors beyond mod - ulation of the actin cytoskeleton may underlie the effects of COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 023 - 04643 - 2 ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2023 ) 6 : 280 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 023 - 04643 - 2 | www . nature . com / commsbio 13 Diaph1 silencing / deletion on regulation of SREBP1 nuclear translocation in the present work , especially as these ﬁ rst studies were performed in mice globally devoid of Diaph1 . Hence , future studies in tissue - speci ﬁ c Diaph1 - deleted mice , such as in hepa - tocytes , will be required in order to probe the full range of potential DIAPH1 - dependent mechanisms . In the present studies , we found that despite signi ﬁ cant reductions in plasma and hepatic concentrations of cholesterol , no signi ﬁ cant differences in the expression of genes directly regulating cholesterol biosynthesis were identi ﬁ ed . It is possible that DIAPH1 - dependent regulation of cholesterol metabolism may be mediated through modulation of the activities of the protein products of the genes regulating cholesterol biosynthesis . It is also possible that DIAPH1 - dependent regulation of Fasn in the livers of WD - fed Ldlr − / − mice , as illustrated by our RNAseq data and con ﬁ rmatory RT - qPCR studies ( Fig . 4 ) , may account for these ﬁ ndings . Speci ﬁ cally , through the actions of FASN , acet - oacetyl CoA , critical to cholesterol biosynthesis , is formed through the condensation of acetyl CoA and malonyl CoA ; processes leading to generation of the fatty acid palmitate . Indeed , it was recently shown that in macrophages , FASN - mediated generation of acetoacetyl CoA contributes to cholesterol synthesis 43 . Hence , it is plausible that DIAPH1 - dependent effects on plasma and hepatic cholesterol were mediated , at least in part , through FASN . Of note , we demonstrated that the aortic arches of male Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice displayed signi ﬁ cantly lower macrophage content compared to Ldlr − / − mice . Although lesional macrophage content in both Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − and Ldlr − / − mice was signi ﬁ cantly correlated with atherosclerosis and plasma cholesterol and trigly - ceride concentrations , our analyses ( Supplementary Table 8 ) probing speci ﬁ c roles for the Diaph1 genotype in Ldlr − / − mice suggested that DIAPH1 appears to exert negligible effects on the dependence of atherosclerotic lesion area on macrophage content . These ﬁ ndings were supported by the results of additional experiments reported herein regarding DIAPH1 and its apparently complex effects on in ﬂ ammation . Speci ﬁ cally , although expression of mRNA transcripts encoding Nos2 and Tnfa was signi ﬁ cantly lower , and expression of mRNA transcripts encoding Il10 and Arg1 was signi ﬁ cantly higher in the aortas of Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − vs . Ldlr − / − mice , by ﬂ ow cytometry , there were no genotype - dependent differences in the percentage of pro - vs . anti - in ﬂ ammatory macrophage markers in the aortic arches and there were no differences in plasma protein concentrations of TNF - alpha or IL6 between the two genotypes . In previous work , pharmaco - logical antagonism of RAGE / DIAPH1 in mice with type 1 and type 2 diabetes resulted in signi ﬁ cant reductions in plasma concentra - tions of TNF - alpha and IL6 44 , thereby emphasizing that the effects of DIAPH1 are dependent on the speci ﬁ c immuno - metabolic characteristics in the discrete milieus . Therefore , although the results of the present work do not support a clear compelling role for modulation of in ﬂ ammation underlying DIAPH - dependent effects on atherosclerosis , it is important to note the following : First , there is precedent for intrinsic roles for DIAPH1 expression in immune cells and in ﬂ ammation . For example , our previous investigations demonstrated regulation of hypoxia - stimulated expression of Egr1 and downstream pro - in ﬂ ammatory and pro - thrombotic genes in macrophages via serum SRF pathways through DIAPH1 14 . In other work , DIAPH1 was implicated in activation and migration of neutrophils 45 . Second , the present studies were performed in mice globally devoid of Diaph1 , thereby potentially masking discrete effects of DIAPH1 in other cell types , such as T lymphocytes , in the overall in ﬂ ammatory milieu . For these reasons , we note that future studies in mice bearing distinct immune cell - speci ﬁ c deletion of Diaph1 in the absence of Ldlr , such as in myeloid cells or T lymphocytes , should directly uncover if myeloid Diaph1 contributes to atherosclerosis and if such ﬁ ndings are dependent - or independent of differences in plasma / liver content of cholesterol and triglyceride . Such experiments , coupled with single cell / single nucleus transcriptomic studies , may distinguish the effects of DIAPH1 in vascular cells , immune cells or hepato - cytes and their cross - talk on lipid metabolism , in ﬂ ammation and atherosclerosis . In the present study , we demonstrated that both male and female Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice displayed signi ﬁ cantly less atherosclerosis at the aortic sinus compared with Ldlr − / − mice ; however , in both sexes , although the mice devoid of both Ldlr − / − and Diaph1 − / − displayed signi ﬁ cantly lower plasma concentra - tions of cholesterol compared to that observed in Ldlr − / − mice ; only in male but not female Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice , were sig - ni ﬁ cant reductions in plasma concentrations of triglyceride also observed . These considerations notwithstanding , our correlation analyses revealed that the plasma concentrations of cholesterol , but not triglycerides , signi ﬁ cantly correlated with atherosclerotic lesion area in male Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice and Ldlr − / − mice . In female mice , the concentrations of plasma cholesterol correlated with atherosclerotic lesion area only in Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − mice but not Ldlr − / − mice . It is notable that multiple reports in the literature have identi ﬁ ed sex differences in plasma concentrations of cholesterol and / or triglyceride in mice devoid of Apoe or the Ldlr in various settings , such as during pharmacological inter - ventions or upon superimposed genetic modi ﬁ cations 46 – 52 . Finally , a question of great interest has been the dissection of overlapping vs . unique roles for RAGE and DIAPH1 in regulation of signal transduction and gene expression stimulated by RAGE ligands . Multiple studies have demonstrated that deletion of Ager reduces atherosclerosis and attenuates vascular in ﬂ ammation 4 – 7 . Interestingly , although previous studies did not ascribe lipid regulation functions to RAGE , in fact , closer inspection suggested potential roles for modest RAGE - dependent reductions in cho - lesterol and triglyceride concentrations in Ager - de ﬁ cient mice 53 , 54 . Indeed , in a recent study using a model of diabetic donor Ldlr − / − atherosclerotic plaques transplanted into recipient diabetic wild - type ( C57BL / 6 J ) , Ager − / − mice fed standard chow , concentrations of serum cholesterol were modestly but sig - ni ﬁ cantly lower in the Ager − / − vs . wild - type recipient mice , although there were no differences in concentrations of serum triglyceride 7 . In that study , in male diabetic mice globally devoid of Diaph1 , modest but signi ﬁ cantly lower plasma concentrations of cholesterol and triglyceride were observed compared to wild - type diabetic male mice in the same C57BL / 6 J background 7 . Although these mice were diabetic and did not have athero - sclerosis , these ﬁ ndings nevertheless suggested that DIAPH1 might contribute to regulation of lipid metabolism ; the under - lying mechanisms or direct effects on atherosclerosis were not explored in that study . Collectively , the results of the present studies buttress the connections between RAGE and DIAPH1 and suggest that blockade of RAGE / DIAPH1 may be a key adjunctive strategy in therapeutic approaches to atherosclerosis , at least in part through regulation of lipid metabolism . In summary , our ﬁ ndings unveil new roles for the formin DIAPH1 in the regulation of cholesterol and triglyceride meta - bolism in a manner independent of direct transcriptional reg - ulation of Srebf1 , Srebf2 , and Mxlipl . This work presents a new lens into DIAPH1 functions in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism , actin organization , nuclear translocation of SREBP1 and their collective impact on atherosclerosis .

Mice ( C57BL / 6 J background ) were de ﬁ cient for the low - density lipoprotein receptor ( Ldlr − / − ) ( The Jackson Laboratories , Stock No 002207 , Bar Harbor ME ) or for Diaphanous 1 ( DIAPH1 ) ( Diaph1 − / − ) 55 backcrossed > 10 generations into Ldlr − / − ( Ldlr − / − Diaph1 − / − ) . Male and female mice were used in this study . The mice were housed under a 12 h ( h ) light / dark cycle in a speci ﬁ c pathogen - free facility and had free access to food and water . Mice were fed a Western diet ( Research Diets , Inc . , D01061401Ci ; 0 . 15 % cholesterol ) for 16 weeks , starting at 6 weeks of age , unless otherwise stated . At sacri ﬁ ce , mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine / xyla - zine injection . Whole blood was collected from the aorta after a 6h fast , unless otherwise indicated . For serum isolation , whole blood was allowed to clot in BD Microtainer SST ( 365967 ) and collected by centrifugation . For plasma isolation , whole blood was collected with EDTA and then subjected to centrifugation . For tissue collection , mice were perfused through a butter ﬂ y needle heart puncture with 1x phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) .

Plasma samples were ﬁ ltered using column - ﬁ lters units of 0 . 22µm pores ( Millipore , UFC30GV00 ) and lipo - proteins were separated in Superose TM 6 10 / 300GL column ( GE Healthcare , GE29 - 0915 - 96 ) on a Shimadzu FPLC system using FPLC Buffer ( 150mM NaCl , 1mM EDTA ) . Equal volumes of ﬁ ltered plasma were injected into the FPLC system for each mouse . Following separation , 72 fractions were collected for each mouse plasma sample and total cholesterol content was quanti ﬁ ed in each single fraction using an enzymatic assay ( Wako Diagnostics , 439 - 17501 ) . Plasma ELISAs for detection of in ﬂ ammation . Plasma was assessed for con - centrations of TNF - alpha and IL6 using commercially - available ELISA kits from R & D Systems according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions : TNF - alpha ( MTA00B , Lot # P338520 ) and IL6 ( M6000B , Lot # P342576 ) . Liver Triglyceride measurements . Measurement of liver triglyceride content was performed as follows : 100 mg of liver tissue was homogenized in chlor - oform : methanol using zirconia beads .

Determination of triglyceride , apolipoprotein B100 ( apoB100 ) and apolipo - protein B48 ( apoB48 ) secretion . After an overnight fast , mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of 200µCi of [ 35 S ] methionine / cysteine protein labeling mix ( NEG772002MC , Perkin Elmer ) combined with 1 , 000 mg / kg pluronic F127 poloxamer - 407 ( BASF , P2443 , Sigma - Aldrich ) to inhibit lipoprotein clearance from plasma as previously described 58 . Triglyceride secretion was calculated using plasma collected at 2 h post - injection . Total plasma apoB100 and apoB48 secretion was determined by taking 2µl of plasma from the 2h time point and separating the proteins by SDS - PAGE gel electrophoresis followed by densitometric quanti ﬁ cation using ImageJ . Plasma from Apobec1 − / − mice ( which express only apo B100 ) was used as control to identify apoB100 and apoB48 bands 59 , 60 . Histological measurement of atherosclerosis . Atherosclerosis was measured by the following three methods : ( 1 ) at the aortic arch ; ( 2 ) at the aortic sinus ; and ( 3 ) by en face analysis of the aorta according to established methods per published recommendations : 61 Aortic arch and brachiocephalic artery analyses was per - formed as follows , the arch of the aorta was dissected under a microscope and frozen in OCT embedding medium for serial cryosectioning . To quantify cross - sectional lesion area in the brachiocephalic artery , the Y - shaped piece of bra - chiocephalic artery was sectioned distally to proximally at 6 μ m thickness , starting from the subclavian and carotid arteries . Atherosclerotic lesions lumenal to the internal elastic lamina were quanti ﬁ ed in 6 equidistant ( 100 μ m ) H & E - stained sections 300 – 600 μ m from the branching point of the brachiocephalic into the carotid and subclavian arteries were collected . The processing of the tissues was handled identically in all of the mice to ensure uniformity . H & E staining is described below . Atherosclerosis at the aortic sinus was assessed as follows , mouse hearts were removed , oriented in a supine position and cut above the midline using a standard blade . The apex of the heart was discarded . Plastic molds were ﬁ lled with OCT and the heart was placed midline down . The molds were placed on pre - cooled metal racks in dry ice and allowed to cool until they were completely set . The frozen roots were then placed into a − 80°C freezer for storage until sec - tioning . OCT - embedded hearts were sectioned through the aortic root ( 6 µm ) . Four cross sections ( 50 µm apart ) of the aortic sinus were cut per mouse per slide and 5 slides per mouse were prepared . The ﬁ rst section was harvested when the ﬁ rst cusp became visible in the lumen of the aorta . Tissue blocks were cut into sections ( 10 µm thick ) . The processing of the tissues was handled identically in all of the mice to ensure uniformity . Sections were ﬁ xed with 10 % neutral buffered formalin for 7 – 10 min at room temperature . H & E staining is described in the section to follow . H & E Staining of histological sections . Slides were stained with Gill ’ s Hematox - ylin ( SigmaAldrich , SLCH6216 ) by dipping three times into a staining dish . The slides were then rinsed thoroughly in deionized water until run - off was clear . The slides were then stained with a bluing solution for 30 seconds and rinsed with deionizzed water until clear run off . The slides were dehydrated with 70 % ethanol solution for 5 min and then dipped once into Eosin to counterstain . Dehydration in 100 % ethanol was continued three times for ﬁ ve min each , and in Xylene three times for ﬁ ve min each .
