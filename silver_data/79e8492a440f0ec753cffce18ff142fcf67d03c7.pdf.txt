However , it is crucial to understand the impact of brain tumors , speciﬁcally low - grade gliomas , on creative cognition , as these tumors predominantly affect brain regions associated with cognitive creativity . In this study , we investigated creative cognition using the Alternative Uses Task ( AUT ) and the Combination of Associates Task ( CAT ) in a cohort of 29 patients who underwent brain surgery for a low - grade glioma , along with 27 control participants . While the group of patients did not exhibit deﬁcits in clinical neuropsycho - logical assessments , our results revealed signiﬁcant impairment in generating original and creative ideas compared to the control group . Furthermore , when analyzing the speciﬁc brain regions affected by the tumors , patients with lesions overlapping the left rostro - lateral prefrontal cortex , a critical region forcreativity , displayedmore pronouncedimpairments in the CAT compared to patients with lesions outside this region . These ﬁndings provide proof of concept that patients can experience impaired creative cognition following surgery for low - grade glioma , highlighting the importance of assessing higher - order cognitive func - tions , includingcreativity , inneurosurgicalpatients . Moreover , beyonditsclinicalrelevance , our study contributes to advancing our understanding of the neuroscience of creativity . © 2024 The Authors . Published by Elsevier Ltd .

Introduction Creativity is a multidimensional ability relevant to artistic productions , technological innovations , societal progress , or children ' s education ( Lubart et al . , 2013 ; Weisberg , 2006 ) . It is deﬁned as the ability to produce something ( an idea , a work ) that is both original and appropriate ( Lubart et al . , 2013 ; Sternberg , 1999 ) . Creativity is popularly related to extraordi - nary discoveries . However , it is also relevant for everyday situations such as solving new problems , adapting to new events , overcoming constraints , or even coping with negative emotions ( Lopez - Persem et al . , 2022 ; Mastria et al . , 2018 ; Weisberg , 2006 ; Wu et al . , 2019 ) . Research in the neuroscience of creativity has developed considerably in recent decades , leading to new frameworks for studying creative cognition and a better understanding of the underlying brain mecha - nisms . Although creativity is relevant in many everyday life aspects and has been related to activity in speciﬁc brain re - gions , studies investigating the consequences of brain lesions on creativity abilities are scarce ( Abraham , 2019 ; Bieth et al . , 2019 ; Bieth , Lopez - Persem , et al . , 2021 ; Ovando - Tellez et al . , 2019 ) . Yet , exploring patients with brain lesions could lead to identifying critical brain regions involved in creative cogni - tion . In return , investigating creativity impairments in neurological patients could help to monitor and plan thera - peutic interventions . Recent cognitive models of creativity suggested that crea - tive thinking relates to an interaction between associative processes ( i . e . , the ability to generate spontaneously and freely associations of ideas ) and control processes ( i . e . , the ability to evaluate and select an idea involving inhibition and goal - directed behavior ) ( Benedek & Jauk , 2018 ; Volle , 2017 ) . Recently , functional connectivity studies revealed the impor - tance of two brain networks during creativity tasks ( Beaty et al . , 2016 , 2017 ) : the default mode network , hypothetically associated with spontaneous associative processes ( Christoff et al . , 2016 ) , and the executive control network likely sup - porting executive processes ( Power & Petersen , 2013 ) . This recent ﬁnding supports neurocognitive models of creativity in which associative and control processes are balanced during creative idea generation . In these models , the prefrontal cor - tex appears as a critical hub involved in both the executive control and the default mode networks . In agreement with this view , several meta - analyses of fMRI studies exploring brain correlates of creativity highlighted the prefrontal cortex as a consistently recruited region ( Boccia et al . , 2015 ; Cogdell - Brooke et al . , 2020 ; Gonen - Yaacovi et al . , 2013 ; Kuang et al . , 2022 ; Pidgeon et al . , 2016 ; Shen et al . , 2016 , 2018 ; Sprugnoli et al . , 2017 ; Wu et al . , 2015 ) . Although scarce , studies exploring creativity abilities in patients with brain lesions can help understand the brain critical regions and mechanisms of creativity . Most lesion studies showed that brain lesions were associated with deﬁ - cits in various creativity tasks ( Bieth et al . , 2019 ; Bieth , Lopez - Persem , et al . , 2021 ; Ovando - Tellez et al . , 2019 ) . However , they often compared patient groups according to their broad lesion locations at the regional level , leading to low anatomical res - olution conclusions . Previous patient studies showed that patients with a focal lesion in the prefrontal cortex ( Abraham et al . , 2012 ; Bendetowicz et al . , 2018 ; Reverberi et al . , 2005 ; Shamay - Tsoory et al . , 2011 ) or a neurological disease affecting the prefrontal cortex ( Canesi et al . , 2017 ; de Souza et al . , 2010 ; Giovagnoli , 2020 ; Paulin et al . , 2020 ; Rankin et al . , 2007 ; Senf et al . , 2016 ) were impaired in creativity tasks . This suggests that the frontal lobes are critical for creative thinking ( Bieth et al . , 2019 ; Bieth , Lopez - Persem , et al . , 2021 ; Ovando - Tellez et al . , 2019 ) , consistent with ﬁndings from research on healthy participants ( Boccia et al . , 2015 ; Cogdell - Brooke et al . , 2020 ; Gonen - Yaacovi et al . , 2013 ; Kuang et al . , 2022 ; Pidgeon et al . , 2016 ; Shen et al . , 2016 , 2018 ; Sprugnoli et al . , 2017 ; Wu et al . , 2015 ) . Only one study explored the consequences of a brain lesion on creative thinking using a lesion - deﬁcit map - ping approach at the voxel - based regional level and the brain network level ( Bendetowicz et al . , 2018 ) . The authors found that a disconnection of the default mode network or the ex - ecutive control network was associated with a deﬁcit in a creativity task that relies on combining remote semantic as - sociates . The ﬁndings highlighted two critical prefrontal re - gions within these networks : a left rostro - lateral region ( included in the executive control network ) and a medial re - gion ( included in the default mode network ) . These results emphasized the complexity of the prefrontal cortex organi - zation involving subregions belonging to different functional systems ( Thiebaut de Schotten et al . , 2017 ) that play distinct roles in creativity . Although previous studies investigated the critical lesion location for creative thinking , little is known about creative abilities in patients suffering from a speciﬁc brain disease . An intriguing group of patients to be studied in this regard is patients with low - grade IDH - mutated gliomas . Low - grade IDH - mutated gliomas are inﬁltrative brain tumors , occurring classically in young adults . They are characterized by an initial slow growth rate ( Mandonnet et al . , 2003 ) , allowing efﬁcient implementation of plasticity mechanisms . Hence , diagnosis is usually made after a ﬁrst seizure , in an otherwise almost asymptomatic patient . However , these tumors may evolve towards higher - grade gliomas , then compromising patients ' prognosis . This is why surgical resection is the ﬁrst line of treatment ( Weller et al . , 2017 ) . The challenge for the surgeon is to optimize the onco - functional balance in each patient , that is to resect brain tissue as much as needed ( to cure the patient ) without inducing cognitive deﬁcits ( to maintain a normal social - professional life ) ( Mandonnet & Duffau , 2018 ) . Creativity in this pathology is important to study because the preferential locations of low - grade glioma largely overlap with brain regions or networks that support creative cognition in healthy subjects , such as the prefrontal cortex ( in its medial or rostro - lateral parts ) , the insular , or the temporal lobe ( Duffau & Capelle , 2004 ; Mithani et al . , 2019 ; Parisot et al . , 2016 ) . Assessing lesion - related cognitive deﬁcits in these patients e such as creative cognition measures e could be relevant not only to detect early high cognitive function deﬁcits and provide early rehabilitation , but also , to design intraoperative tasks allowing to monitor these func - tions in an awake patient and to spare the critical areas ( Mandonnet et al . , 2020 ) . Based on the brain regions known to be involved in creativity , we can hypothesize that frontal brain tumors and / or their resection will impair creative thinking tasks . Only two studies showed that such patients cortex xxx ( xxxx ) xxx 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 CORTEX3890 _ proof ■ 3 April 2024 ■ 2 / 15 Please cite this article as : Bieth , T et al . , Impaired creative cognition after surgery for an IDH - mutated glioma : A proof - of - concept study , Cortex , https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . cortex . 2024 . 02 . 017 were impaired in generating divergent thinking ( Butler et al . , 1993 ) or in insight problem - solving ( Reverberi et al . , 2005 ) after frontal tumor resection . However , several limitations should be considered . Butler et al . ( 1993 ) assessed patients ' creativity Q4 by considering only ﬂuency scores without paying attention to the originality or creativity of responses . In addition , they did not address the precise lesion location . Reverberi et al . ( 2005 ) used matchstick arithmetic insight problems with several levels of difﬁculty . Although creativity was assessed using a limited number of problems , the authors showed that compared to control , patients with a lateral lesion solved more problems whereas patients with a medial lesion were impaired in solving problems , leading to confusing conclusions . Finally , these two studies used pa - tients with different types of brain tumors that showed distinct pathogenic proﬁles . The present study aims to measure quantitively Q5 and qualitatively the patients ' creativity after surgery for a low - grade glioma . We chose this population because preferential low - grade glioma locations clearly overlap with the regions classically involved in creativity and because indirect evi - dence indicates that a tumor excision can affect patients ' creative abilities . Creative abilities were assessed using two tasks exploring different aspects of creative cognition . First , the Alternative Uses Test ( AUT Q6 ) ( Guilford , 1950 ) assesses divergent thinking , the ability to generate alternative and original ideas . It is considered the most used approach in neuroscience to study creativity . Second , the Combined As - sociates Task ( CAT ) , a task adapted from the Remote Associate Test ( Bendetowicz et al . , 2018 ; Mednick , 1962 ) , assesses asso - ciative combination , the ability to combine remote semantic associates to create a new one . This approach emphasizes the role of semantic associations in memory for creativity ( Benedek & Neubauer , 2013 ; Kenett et al . , 2014 ; Mednick , 1962 ; Mednick et al . , 1964 ) , supported by several studies ( Benedek et al . , 2017 ; Bernard et al . , 2019 ; He et al . , 2021 ; Kenett , 2019 ; Kenett et al . , 2011 , 2014 ; Kenett & Faust , 2019 ; Ovando - Tellez , Benedek , et al . , 2022 ; Ovando - Tellez et al . , 2023 ; Ovando - Tellez , Kenett , et al . , 2022 ; Yan et al . , 2021 ) . Based on their preferential lesion location , we hypothesized that low - grade glioma patients would be impaired in creativity abilities compared to control and that our tasks could reveal speciﬁc deﬁcits depending on lesion location . 2 . Methods 2 . 1 . Participants The patient and control samples were included as part of a larger study that involved different lines of analysis and described in detail in Facque et al . ( 2022 ) . In the current study , we focus on creativity tasks that were not assessed in this previous study . 2 . 1 . 1 . Neurosurgical patients We included patients retrospectively from a routine care cohort composed of patients suffering from IDH - mutated low - grade glioma followed in the neurosurgery department of Lariboisi (cid:3) ere Hospital ( Paris , France ) . These patients underwent usual neuropsychological assessment by a speech therapist before and after surgery as well as a brain MRI . Starting from June 2018 , a neuropsychologist also evaluated high - level cognition , including creativity , in the cohort of pa - tients followed in our institute for a low - grade glioma . We did not include the rare patients who had creativity tests before surgery , to avoid a test - retest effect . Before their assessment , all patients were orally informed that these data could be used for clinical research . We retrospectively selected for our analysis native French speakers and right - handed patients who performed creativity tests ( see Material ) after Q7 surgery between the 8th of January 2018 and the 5th of January 2021 . We did not include patients with progressive disease or ongoing adjuvant therapy at the time of their evaluation , nor patients with non - IDH - mutated glioma , in order to have a group of patients as homogeneous as possible . As it was a retrospective study , the sample size was of convenience . A total of 29 patients suffering from IDH - mutated low - grade glioma ( 18 males and 11 females , mean age : 46 years old ± 2 . 11 ( SEM ) ) were analyzed . These patients were recruited for a previous study of our team ( Facque et al . , 2022 ) . The study was conducted following our institution ' s ethical standards for a retrospective study . From the 29 patients included , 21 ( 72 % ) received antiepi - leptic medications ( mainly Levetiracetam , except one patient had Levetiracetam combined with Carbamazepine , another one had Oxcarbazepine alone , and a last one had Oxcarbaze - pine combined with Lamotrigine ) , 15 ( 52 % ) had systematic adjuvant chemotherapy after the surgery , and 6 ( 21 % ) had external radiotherapy targeting the surgical site . 2 . 1 . 2 . Control group Twenty - seven native French speakers ( 13 males and 14 fe - males , mean age : 48 years old ± 2 . 68 ( SEM ) ) were included in the control group . They were healthy adults with normal or corrected - to - normal vision , with no color - blindness , no medical history of sleep disease , no psychiatry or medical history , no psychotropic substance abuse , no alcohol use 24 h before the assessment . They were matched one - to - one with patients ' demographics ( age , gender , and educational level ) . All participants gave a written informed consent to participate to this experiment , which had been approved by the ethics committee of Paris Sorbonne university . They received mon - etary compensation ( 30 V ) for their time . 2 . 1 . 3 . A posteriori exclusion Because of technical issues during the task completion , three patients and one control participant were excluded from an - alyses related to the AUT . Hence , 26 patients and 26 control were analyzed for the AUT , and 29 patients and 27 control were analyzed for the CAT . 2 . 2 . Experimental procedure The participants ( patients and controls ) underwent the same 4 - h testing conducted by a neuropsychologist ( VF ) . All tasks were computed using the Paradigm software running on in - dividual computers . Task - related instructions were initially explained before the beginning of each task . Patients ' tasks were administered in the neurosurgery department of cortex xxx ( xxxx ) xxx 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 CORTEX3890 _ proof ■ 3 April 2024 ■ 3 / 15 Please cite this article as : Bieth , T et al . , Impaired creative cognition after surgery for an IDH - mutated glioma : A proof - of - concept study , Cortex , https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . cortex . 2024 . 02 . 017 Lariboisi (cid:3) ere Hospital ( Paris , France ) . Controls ' assessments were done in a classroom dedicated to cognitive experiments ( Prisme platform ) in the Paris Brain Institute of La Piti (cid:1) e - Sal - p ^ etri (cid:3) ere Hospital ( Paris , France ) ( https : / / institutducerveau - icm . org / fr / prisme - human - behavior - exploration - core - facility / ) . The overall assessment was aimed to also investigate fatigability induced by the various high - order cognitive tasks , including creativity tasks , on decision - making ( Facque et al . , 2022 ) . Creativity tasks started right after the calibration of monetary choices . Before and in between creativity tasks , subjects were asked to perform series of monetary choices , which are not supposed to interfere with creative abilities . In the present study , we only report the results related to the impact of brain lesions on speciﬁc high - order cognitive tasks related to creative abilities , as well as on the clinical neuro - psychological testing . 2 . 2 . 1 . Neuropsychological testing Patients performed usual neuropsychological tests assessing several cognitive functions . The average delay between the neuropsychological tests and the surgery day was 249 days ( range ¼ [ 60 e 1675 ] , SD ¼ 370 ) . First , we controlled patients ' language abilities . Lexical abilities were assessed with DO80 ( Metz et al . , 1991 ) , in which patients were asked to name as fast as possible 80 pictures . One patient did the picture naming task of the BECS ( Merck et al . , 2011 ) that included 40 trials instead of 80 . Semantic abilities were assessed using the pyramid and palm tree test ( Howard & Patterson , 1992 ) ( PPTT ) , which requires patients to make semantic associations on a forced binary choice . Six patients did a semantic association test of the BECS ( Merck et al . , 2011 ) that included 40 trials instead of 52 . In the cate - gorical ﬂuency task , patients were asked to provide as many animal names as possible in two minutes ( Godefroy et al . , 2010 ) . Then , executive functions and working memory abilities were tested . Cognitive inhibition was assessed with the Stroop test ( Stroop , 1935 ) , focusing on the difference be - tween the completion times in the interference condition and the denomination condition . Mental ﬂexibility was assessed with the trail - making test ( Godefroy et al . , 2010 ) ( TMT ) , focusing on the difference between the completion times in part B and part A . Executive functions were also assessed with a lexical ﬂuency task , in which patients were asked to give as many words starting with the letter “ P ” as possible in two minutes ( Godefroy et al . , 2010 ) . Finally , pa - tients did a forward and backward digit span ( Gr (cid:1) egoire & Van der Linden , 1997 ) , testing their verbal working mem - ory abilities . All scores were z - scored compared to a standardized reference population , considering the age and the educational level of individuals . We reversed the sign of resulting z - scores for tests that used reaction time ( i . e . , TMT and Stroop test ) in order to obtain homogeneous interpretation ( the higher , the better ) . Although a few patients obtained pathological scores in one or several of these tests , none of these tests showed signiﬁcant impairment at the group level ( i . e . , average normalized score minor than (cid:2) 1 . 68 ) ( Table 1 ) . 2 . 2 . 2 . Creativity tasks and behavioral measures Creative abilities were assessed using the AUT and the CAT . The delay between the creativity tests and the surgery day was on average 683 days ( range ¼ [ 78 e 1747 ] , SD ¼ 497 ) . 2 . 2 . 2 . 1 . T HE A LTERNATIVE U SES T ASK ( AUT ) . The AUT is the most used task to explore divergent thinking abilities ( Guilford , 1950 ) , a component of creativity ( Runco & Acar , 2012 ) . In this open - ended task , we asked participants to ﬁnd as many un - usual and alternative uses as possible of a common object . Three objects ( a car tire , a knife , and a bottle ) were succes - sively proposed to participants ( Ovando - Tellez , Kenett , et al . , 2022 ) . They had 3 min per object and provided their re - sponses verbally . The examiner wrote down the participants ' responses and categorized them into three time periods , the ﬁrst , second , and third minute on task . After each object , participants were asked to select among their own responses that were displayed to them , the three responses they judged as the most creative ( Benedek et al . , 2013 ) . A short break was proposed after each object . In this task , we assessed participants ' responses based on several measures , including ﬂuency , the number of non - alternative uses , frequency , and creativity . These measures were computed at the individual level for each object sepa - rately and were then averaged across the three objects for each individual . Fluency correspondedtothenumberofresponsesgenerated duringthe3 - minperiod . Wealsomeasured sub - ﬂuency foreach time period of one minute ( T1 , T2 , and T3 ) . Propositions were counted as non - alternative uses when they were similar to the classical function of the object ( e . g . , a bottle is classically used to contain water , therefore this proposition was labeled as non - alternative ) . The frequency of a response was computed as the number of times this idea was given by the control group ( the more frequently the response was given by other partici - pants , the less original the response was ) . For patients , we assessed response frequency using the whole control group , while for each control participant , we used the control group with themselves removed . As for ﬂuency , we provided sub - fre - quency scores for each time period of one minute . Finally , creativity corresponded to the creativity rating of the three most creative responses selected by the participant for each object . This creativity rating was obtained from an external panel of ﬁve experts in creativity neuroscience research ( TB , SMR , ALP , VA , EV ) . Theyuseda5pointsLikertscalefrom1 ( “ not creative ” ) to 5 ( “ highly creative ” ) . All experts were asked to follow the scoring guidance for consensual creativity ratings , as proposed by expert researchers ( https : / / osf . io / vie7s / ) . All participants ' top - 3responseswereshufﬂedsothatjudgeswere blinded to the participant group ( patient or control ) . We observed good reliability across the ﬁve judges ( intra - class coefﬁcient ¼ . 82 ) . Finally , the creativity variable corresponded to the average ratings across the three objects at the individual level . 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 . T HE C OMBINED A SSOCIATES T ASK ( CAT ) .

In the CAT , we controlled the semantic dis - tance between the expected response and the three cue words ( Bendetowicz et al . , 2018 ) . The semantic distance was approximated by the strength of association using a French associative norm available online ( Debrenne , 2011 ) . Based on the semantic distance , we built close trials ( in which the element to combine are semantically close ) and distant trials ( in which the element to combine are semantically remote ) . The present version of the CAT includes 40 trials ( 20 trials in both close and distant conditions ) . Each trial was deﬁned by a strength of association corresponding to the average strength of association of each of the three cue words with the expected response . We deﬁned close and distant trials based on the median of the strength of association of all trials ( median ¼ 6 . 56 , range ¼ [ . 34 e 38 . 78 ] ) . Each trial followed the same procedure ( Bendetowicz et al . , 2017 , 2018 ; Ovando - Tellez et al . , 2023 ) . First , the three cue words were displayed on the screen , and participants had up to 30 sec to respond . The response could be a noun , a verb , or an adjective but not a proper noun or a compound word . As soon as they thought they reached a correct answer , they pressed the space button on the keyboard and said their response aloud . The examiner wrote participants ' responses down . We measured the accuracy ( i . e . , the number of correct trials ) for both close and distant trials . We computed a CAT - index reﬂecting the ability to solve distant trials ( the more creative condition ) whencontrollingforperformanceinclosetrials ( the less creative condition ) . It was computed as the difference between accuracy on close and distant trials , divided by the average accuracy in both conditions ( Bendetowicz et al . , 2018 ) . The lower the CAT - index was , the higher the creativity abilities were . 2 . 3 . Behavioral analyses AUT e We ran non - parametric two - tailed Wilcoxon tests ( wilcox . test function ) to compare the number of non - alternative uses and the creativity of responses in the AUT between the patient and control groups . The difference in ﬂuency and fre - quency were explored using analyses of variance ( ANOVAs , aov function ) with ﬂuency or frequency as dependent variables , and time ( three levels : ﬁrst , second , and third minute ) and group ( two levels : patient and control ) as independent variables . We added the subject factor as a random effect in order to consider the repeated measures within participants and the variability between participants . Post - hoc analyses were per - formed to interpret signiﬁcant effects in the model . Post - hoc analyses ' p values were corrected by the number of analyses using a Bonferroni method . CAT e We used ANOVAs to compare accuracy ( dependent variable ) across conditions ( two levels independent variable : close and distant ) and groups ( two levels independent vari - able : patient and control ) . As in previous models , we added the subject factor as a random effect . Post - hoc analyses were performed to interpret signiﬁcant effects in the model , and post - hoc analyses ' p values were corrected for the number of analyses using a Bonferroni method . The CAT - index was compared between patient and control groups using a non - parametric two - tailed Wilcoxon test . 2 . 4 . Lesion processing We used individual patients ' clinical T1 - weighted MRIs per - formed systematically four months after surgery to delineate resection cavities . Post - surgical brain cavities were segmented manually using MI - Brain software ( https : / / github . com / imeka / mi - brain ) , and were normalized into the Montreal Neurological Institute ( MNI ) space using the transformation between patient T1 and MNI template given by ANTs diffeo - morphic registration ( Avants et al . , 2011 ) . The overlap of in - dividual cavities is displayed in Fig . 1 . Most patients had a lesion in the frontal lobe ( n ¼ 23 , 79 % ) and in the left hemi - sphere ( n ¼ 19 , 66 % ) . 2 . 5 . Lesion location - based analyses Whole - brain analyses were not conducted because the low number of overlapping lesions did not offer enough statistical power to conduct a whole - brain lesion - deﬁcit mapping approach . Instead , we used a hypothesis - based approach to investigate the impact of brain lesion location on behavioral measures . We selected regions of interest ( ROIs ) based on previous patient studies on creativity using an exhaustive literature review ( Bieth , Lopez - Persem , et al . , 2021 ; Ovando - Table 1 e Classical neuropsychological assessment of patients .

For the CAT , we used the cluster reported in a previous study as a ROI ( Bendetowicz et al . , 2018 ) . This study is the only one that provided a lesion - deﬁcit mapping at the voxel level related to the CAT . This cluster was located in the left rostro - lateral prefrontal cortex ( volume . 23 cm 3 ; Brod - mann area 10 ; MNI coordinates x ¼ (cid:2) 30 , y ¼ 50 , z ¼ 2 mm ) and was associated with a deﬁcit in solving CAT ( i . e . , accuracy ) , especially for distant trials ( i . e . , CAT - index ) . Among our 29 patients , seven ( 24 % ) had a lesion that overlapped with the ROI ( ROI þ ) , and 22 ( 76 % ) had a lesion that did not overlap ( ROI (cid:2) ) . It should be noted that Bendetowicz et al . ' s study also reported a cluster located in the right rostro - medial prefrontal cortex ( volume . 38 cm 3 , Brodmann area 10 / 11 ; MNI co - ordinates x ¼ 12 , y ¼ 43 , z ¼ (cid:2) 6 mm ) that was also associated with a deﬁcit in solving CAT . However , only two patients had a lesion overlapping this rostro - medial prefrontal cluster , limiting the use of this brain region as a ROI . Nonetheless , we also tested the effect of this lesion indirectly by pooling pa - tients who had a lesion in either the left rostro - lateral pre - frontal or the right rostro - medial prefrontal clusters ( ROI2 þ ) and comparing them to the other patients ( ROI2 (cid:2) ) . Concerning the AUT , we did not ﬁnd robust evidence in the literature of which ROI to use . Most of lesion studies exploring divergent thinking in patients used group - level analyses , pooling patients with similar anatomical locations . These studies did not provide an ROI with a sufﬁcient spatial reso - lution . Only one study used a lesion - deﬁcit mapping approach but with patients suffering from a neurodegenerative disease affecting mainly the temporal and frontal poles ( Paulin et al . , 2020 ) . Although informative , studies conducted with healthy subjects cannot provide strong evidence for well - characterized brain regions that are critical for AUT . Hence , we did not run lesion location - based analyses for the AUT . We used ANOVAs to compare the CAT accuracy across conditions ( close and distant ) and locations ( patient ROI þ and patient ROI (cid:2) ) . As in previous models used in behavioral analyses , we added the subject factor as a random effect . Post - hoc analyses were performed to interpret signiﬁcant effects in the model using non - parametric two - tailed Wilcoxon test , and p values were corrected for the number of statistical tests performed using a Bonferroni method . The CAT - index was compared between patient ROI þ and patient ROI (cid:2) groups using a non - parametric two - tailed Wilcoxon test . We ran additional analyses to investigate the speciﬁcity of the relationship between brain lesion location and CAT per - formance . We used ANOVAs to compare performance in CAT and AUT ( dependent variable ) across locations ( two levels independent variable : patient ROI þ and patient ROI (cid:2) ) and test ( two levels independent variable : AUT and CAT ) , with the subject factor as a random effect . We ran four different ANOVAs to compare the CAT accuracy with successively the ﬂuency , the number of non - alternative uses , the frequency , and the creativity variable of the AUT . In order to make the scores of the two tests comparable , we z - scored the scores across all patients for each test separately . We also reversed the sign of resulting z - scores for the frequency and the number of non - alternative uses ( the higher , the better ) to have all variables varying in the same direction . We expected to ﬁnd a signiﬁ - cant locations (cid:3) test interaction effect if the ROI was specif - ically critical for performing the CAT task . 3 . Results Q8 3 . 1 .

Second , we found a signiﬁcant main effect of the group [ F ( 1 , 46 ) ¼ 5 . 04 , h 2 ¼ . 62 , p ¼ . 03 ] and the time [ F ( 2 , 91 ) ¼ 10 . 20 , h 2 ¼ . 17 , p ¼ 1 . 01 10 (cid:2) 4 ] on frequency , and a signiﬁcant group (cid:3) time interaction effect on frequency [ F ( 2 , 91 ) ¼ 4 . 15 , h 2 ¼ . 07 , p ¼ . 02 ] . The main effect of the group on frequency suggested that patients ' responses were on average more common ( average frequency : 1 . 88 ± . 19 ) compared to controls ( 1 . 40 ± . 13 ) . Post - hoc analyses exploringthe main effectof time on frequency revealed that , independently of the group , the frequency of responses decreased with time , in particular be - tween the ﬁrst minute ( 2 . 27 ± . 17 ) and the second [ 1 . 20 ± . 13 , F ( 1 , 49 ) ¼ 27 . 01 , h 2 ¼ . 36 , p ¼ 3 . 92 10 (cid:2) 6 ] and the ﬁrst and the last minute [ 1 . 40 ± . 25 , F ( 1 , 44 ) ¼ 9 . 39 , h 2 ¼ . 18 , p ¼ 3 . 71 10 (cid:2) 3 ] . These results suggested that the originality of responses increased with time for both patients and controls . We did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference in frequency between the two last mi - nutes [ F ( 1 , 44 ) ¼ . 32 , p ¼ . 58 ] , probablybecauseoftheinteraction effect . Whereas patients and controls seem to follow the same evolution of the frequency of responses during the two ﬁrst minutes [ T1 : patient2 . 47 ± . 28andcontrol2 . 06 ± . 20 ; T2 : patient 1 . 09 ± . 17 and control 1 . 31 ± . 21 ; F ( 1 , 48 ) ¼ 1 . 90 , p ¼ . 17 ] , post - hoc analyses exploring the group (cid:3) time interaction effect on fre - quency revealed that originality of responses increased more during the last minute of the task in controls than in patients [ T3 : patient 2 . 06 ± . 41 and control . 72 ± . 13 ; F ( 1 , 43 ) ¼ 8 . 12 , h 2 ¼ . 16 , p ¼ 6 . 69 10 (cid:2) 3 ] ( Fig . 2B ) . Of note , our results remained signiﬁcant when removing the outlier patient with scores higher or lower than 2 standard deviations to the mean fre - quency score in T3 . In addition , as expected , we found a signiﬁcant main effect of time on ﬂuency [ F ( 2 , 100 ) ¼ 88 . 52 , h 2 ¼ . 64 , p < 10 (cid:2) 16 ] .

In summary , these results indicate that patients have dif - ﬁculties in generating qualitatively original , alternative , and creative ideas compared to control but can provide an equiv - alent number of responses . 3 . 1 . 2 . Associative combination in neurosurgical patients At the group level , we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences be - tween patient ( n ¼ 29 ) and control ( n ¼ 27 ) in combining ( remote ) semantic elements , assessed by the CAT ( Fig . 3 ) . As expected , we found a signiﬁcant main effect of task condition on accuracy [ F ( 1 , 54 ) ¼ 92 . 14 , h 2 ¼ . 63 , p ¼ 2 . 85 10 (cid:2) 13 ] . On average , participants were more accurate in close trials ( average correct responses : 10 . 88 ± . 53 ) compared to the distant trials ( 6 . 57 ± . 44 ) . However , we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant main effect of participant group on accuracy [ patient 8 . 91 ± . 63 and controls 8 . 52 ± . 61 ; F ( 1 , 54 ) ¼ . 20 , p ¼ . 65 ] , nor a signiﬁcant group (cid:3) condition interaction effect on accuracy [ F ( 1 , 54 ) ¼ 0 , p ¼ . 99 ] . In addition , we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference of CAT - index ( i . e . , the ability to solve distant CAT considering the ability to solve close ones ) between patients ( . 53 ± . 08 ) and controls ( . 57 ± . 11 ; W ¼ 417 , p ¼ . 68 ) . In summary , patients showed no signiﬁcant deﬁcit in solving the CAT compared to controls ( at the group level ) . 3 . 2 . Left rostro - lateral prefrontal cortex is critical in associative combination abilities To go further , we explored whether CAT performance could be related to the location of the lesion . We deﬁned an ROI based on a previous focal lesion study showing the critical role of the left rostro - lateral prefrontal cortex for CAT performance ( Bendetowicz et al . , 2018 ) ( Fig . 4A ) . Among our 29 patients , seven ( 24 % ) had a lesion that overlapped with the ROI ( ROI þ ) , and 22 ( 76 % ) had a lesion that did not overlap ( ROI (cid:2) ) . These two groups ( ROI þ and ROI (cid:2) ) were not signiﬁcantly different in the normalized scores of DO80 ( ROI þ : . 03 ± . 45 ; ROI (cid:2) : (cid:2) . 20 ± . 36 ; W ¼ 81 . 5 , p ¼ . 84 ) , PPTT ( ROI þ : (cid:2) . 21 ± . 83 ; ROI (cid:2) : . 02 ± . 64 ; W ¼ 31 . 5 , p ¼ . 22 ) , forward digit span ( ROI þ : (cid:2) . 42 ± . 42 ; ROI (cid:2) : (cid:2) . 94 ± . 21 ; W ¼ 97 , p ¼ . 32 ) , backward digit span ( ROI þ : (cid:2) 1 . 11 ± . 55 ; ROI (cid:2) : (cid:2) . 72 ± . 19 ; W ¼ 68 , p ¼ . 66 ) , animal ﬂuency ( ROI þ : (cid:2) . 73 ± . 34 ; ROI (cid:2) : (cid:2) . 34 ± . 19 ; W ¼ 58 , p ¼ . 35 ) , letter ﬂuency ( ROI þ : (cid:2) . 48 ± . 68 ; ROI (cid:2) : (cid:2) . 03 ± . 21 ; W ¼ 66 , p ¼ . 59 ) , TMT ﬂexibility ( ROI þ : (cid:2) 1 . 11 ± 1 . 09 ; ROI (cid:2) : . 02 ± . 28 ; W ¼ 47 , p ¼ . 21 ) , and Stroop interference ( ROI þ : (cid:2) 1 . 27 ± 1 . 31 ; ROI (cid:2) : . 03 ± . 31 ; W ¼ 57 . 5 , p ¼ . 65 ) . Regarding CAT performance , we found a signiﬁcant main effect of condition on accuracy [ F ( 1 , 27 ) ¼ 70 . 06 , h 2 ¼ . 71 , p ¼ 5 . 57 10 (cid:2) 9 ] suggesting that participants were more accurate in close trials ( averagecorrectresponses : 11 . 07 ± . 79 ) thandistanttrials ( 6 . 76 ± . 54 ) . Importantly , we found a signiﬁcant main effect of group location on accuracy [ F ( 1 , 27 ) ¼ 7 . 69 , h 2 ¼ . 22 , p ¼ . 01 ] . A post - hoc non - parametric test conﬁrmed this result , indicating that patients who had a lesion that overlapped with the ROI ( ROI þ group , n ¼ 7 ) were impaired in solving CAT ( average correct responses : 6 . 14 ± 1 . 34 ) compared to the ROI (cid:2) group ( n ¼ 22 ; average correct responses : 9 . 80 ± . 55 ; W ¼ 32 , p ¼ . 02 ; Fig . 4B ) . We found similar results ( and even more statistically robust ) if we combined the two prefrontal clusters found in Bendetowicz et al . study ( i . e . , left rostro - lateral and right rostro - median ) to deﬁne the ROI2 . Two patients had a lesion that overlapped the right rostro - median cluster ( average cor - rect responses : 7 and 14 , respectively ) . The ROI2 þ group ( n ¼ 9 ) was signiﬁcantly impaired in solving CAT ( average correct re - sponses : 5 . 94 ± 1 . 08 ) compared to the ROI2 (cid:2) group ( n ¼ 20 , average correct responses : 10 . 25 ± . 56 ; W ¼ 25 . 5 , p ¼ 2 . 47 10 (cid:2) 3 ) . The condition (cid:3) location interaction effect [ F ( 1 , 27 ) ¼ 1 . 64 , p ¼ . 21 ] was not signiﬁcant . In addition , we did not ﬁnd a sig - niﬁcant difference in the CAT - index between the two groups ( ROI þ : . 76 ± . 27 ; ROI (cid:2) : . 46 ± . 06 ; W ¼ 86 . 5 , p ¼ . 65 ; Fig . 4C ) . In order to investigate the speciﬁcity of this result , we explored whether the location of the lesion and the type of Fig . 3 e Associative combination abilities were not different between patients and controls ( at the group level ) .

We removed one patient ROI þ ( n ¼ 6 ) and two pa - tients ROI e ( n ¼ 20 ) because they did not undergo the AUT . We found a signiﬁcant location (cid:3) test interaction effect on pa - tients ' performance when we compared CAT accuracy with AUT ﬂuency [ F ( 1 , 24 ) ¼ 5 . 06 , h 2 ¼ . 17 , p ¼ . 03 ] , CAT accuracy with AUT frequency [ F ( 1 , 24 ) ¼ 7 . 93 , h 2 ¼ . 25 , p ¼ 9 . 55 10 (cid:2) 3 ] , CAT ac - curacy with AUT non - alternative uses number [ F ( 1 , 24 ) ¼ 6 . 06 , h 2 ¼ . 20 , p ¼ . 02 ] , and CAT accuracy with AUT creativity [ F ( 1 , 24 ) ¼ 5 . 63 , h 2 ¼ . 20 , p ¼ . 03 ] ( Fig . 5 ) . These results suggest that the lesion - related deﬁcit in the CAT was speciﬁc to this task compared to AUT , supporting the critical and speciﬁc role of the rostro - lateral prefrontal cortex in combining unrelated semantic associates . 4 . Discussion The present study provides unique data showing how brain lesions related to low - grade glioma surgery impact creativity . Speciﬁcally , patients generated less original and creative ideas in a divergent thinking task . In addition , patients with a lesion that overlapped a critical node for creativity ( i . e . , the left rostro - lateral prefrontal cortex ) showed a speciﬁc impairment in a creativity task that requires a combination of remote associates . These results provide proof of concept that pa - tients with low - grade glioma may be impacted in their crea - tive abilities after surgery , emphasizing the importance of assessing this high - order cognitive function in neurosurgical patients . Besides clinical relevance , these results also advance our knowledge on the neuroscience of creativity . Although the preferential location of low - grade glioma largely overlaps with the regions and networks associated with creative cognition in healthy subjects ( Bieth , Lopez - Persem , et al . , 2021 ) , only a few studies speciﬁcally focused on patients ' creativity after brain tumor surgery . Reverberi et al . ( 2005 ) showed that patients suffering from various brain tumors ( mainly meningioma ) in the medial prefrontal cortex had poorer insight problem - solving rates , whereas the solving rate was higher if the lesion was in the lateral pre - frontal cortex . Butler et al . ( 1993 ) found that patients with various brain tumors had difﬁculties in several divergent thinking tasks ( including the AUT ) , but the authors only quantiﬁed ﬂuency , not the originality of the ideas . In the present study , we extended these results by several means . First , we qualitatively assessed the originality and creativity of generated responses in the divergent thinking task , providing a more comprehensive assessment of creativity . We showed that patients generated less original and creative responses in a classical divergent thinking task ( i . e . , the AUT ) , compared to controls . This result was not due to a difference in ﬂuency between the two groups . Second , we found that creativity of patients with rostral prefrontal lesions could be impaired in another aspect of creativity , that is the associative combina - tion assessed by the CAT . Finally , our sample was exclusively composed of a homogeneous group of patients with low - grade IDH - muted glioma . It provides for the ﬁrst - time evidence that these patients can have a deﬁcit in creativity after surgery . Remarkably , creativity deﬁcit related to low - grade glioma contrasted with the preserved classical neuropsychological assessment of semantic and lexical abilities , working memory or executive functions . Considering the usual neuropsycho - logical assessment alone , one could say that surgery did not impact individual cognition . This contrast suggests that routine medical care should assess high - order cognitive functions to plan therapeutic interventions or propose early speciﬁc cognitive rehabilitation in neurological patients . Ul - timately , high - order cognitive assessment including creative thinking could be used in awake surgery to guide the surgeon in planning and / or monitoring the resection of the maximum of tissue without inducing cognitive deﬁcits . However , adapting neuropsychological tests to the environmental con - straints of the surgery room remains challenging ( Bieth , Lopez - Persem , et al . , 2021 ) . Only one study adapted the AUT to match awake surgery condition to speciﬁcally investigate brain correlates of divergent thinking ( Shofty et al . , 2022 ) . However , task performance was not assessed during the surgical procedure itself but rather analyzed off - line after the surgery . Additional work is needed to be able to provide useful and optimized on - line feedback about the patient ' s perfor - mance to guide the surgeon during the brain stimulations for cognitive mapping ( Bieth , Lopez - Persem , et al . , 2021 ) . An alternative could be the use of other tasks that provide a straightforward scoring procedure , such as the CAT . It may help the surgeon remove the brain tumor as much as possible Fig . 4 e Left rostro - lateral prefrontal cortex is critical for combining unrelated elements . We extracted Bendetowicz et al .

By observing creativity deﬁcits after surgery , our study justiﬁes initiating the adaptation of high - order cognitive tests in awake surgery , in particular for low - grade glioma . Our results also reinforced the critical role of the prefrontal cortex in creative cognition , as most of the lesion locations of our sample were in the prefrontal cortex ( 79 % ) . This obser - vation is in line with previous studies showing that focal ( Abraham et al . , 2012 ; Bendetowicz et al . , 2018 ; Reverberi et al . , 2005 ; Shamay - Tsoory et al . , 2011 ) and non - focal lesions ( Canesi et al . , 2017 ; de Souza et al . , 2010 ; Giovagnoli , 2020 ; Paulin et al . , 2020 ; Rankin et al . , 2007 ; Senf et al . , 2016 ) affecting the prefrontal cortex were associated with deﬁcits in various creativity tasks . It emphasizes that patients ' creativity may be impaired due to neurological lesions affecting the frontal lobes . As the creativity of patients suffering from neurological or neurosurgical diseases is not assessed in medical practice , deﬁcits in creativity may be underestimated . Importantly , we replicated previous results showing the critical role of the rostro - lateral prefrontal cortex in associa - tive combination ( Bendetowicz et al . , 2018 ) in a new sample of patients speciﬁcally suffering from resected low - grade gli - omas . In our sample , we found that patients were impaired in the CAT in case of a lesion in the rostro - lateral prefrontal re - gion , which was also found critical for the same task in the study by Bendetowicz and colleagues . In other ﬁelds , the rostro - lateral part of the prefrontal cortex has been associated with analogical reasoning ( Hobeika et al . , 2016 ; Holyoak & Monti , 2021 ; Urbanski et al . , 2016 ) , abstraction ( Christoff et al . , 2009 ) , and multitasking ( Koechlin et al . , 1999 ) . This brain region has also been associated with associative com - binations in healthy participants using different neuro - imaging methods ( Bendetowicz et al . , 2017 ; Bieth , Ovando - Tellez , et al . , 2021 ; Gonen - Yaacovi et al . , 2013 ; Ovando - Tellez et al . , 2023 ) . Our results reinforce the critical role of the left rostro - lateral prefrontal cortex in creativity , when a combination of ideas is needed to meet the constraints of the task . In our study , we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly different ef - fect of semantic remoteness on CAT solving rate ( CAT - index ) between patients and controls and between the lesion loca - tion within the patient group . It could be because we used a shorter version of the CAT , including 40 trials instead of 72 trials in the initial study ( Bendetowicz et al . , 2018 ) . Interestingly , we uniquely showed that this region was explicitly critical for associative combination but not diver - gent thinking . Associative combination may require addi - tional cognitive processes than generating semantic associations , such as combining several new and unusual associations of ideas ( Bendetowicz et al . , 2018 ; Volle , 2017 ) . It highlights the complex functional organization of the pre - frontal cortex ( Thiebaut de Schotten et al . , 2017 ) , and suggests that the prefrontal cortex is involved in several speciﬁc crea - tivity processes . Of note , a minority of studies reported an exaltation of creativity after brain lesions ( Reverberi et al . , 2005 ; Shamay - Tsoory et al . , 2011 ) , or non - invasive trans - cranial stimulation ( Chrysikou et al . , 2013 , 2021 ; Kleinmintz et al . , 2018 ; Luft et al . , 2017 ) targeting the prefrontal cortex . Brain stimulation ﬁndings have suggested a dissociation in the role of the left ventral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in divergent and convergent thinking and that inhibition of the inferolateral prefrontal region may improve divergent thinking speciﬁcally ( Chen et al . , 2022 ; Hertenstein et al . , 2019 ; Li et al . , 2023 ; Weinberger et al . , 2017 ) . Although these results need to be better understood ( Bieth , Lopez - Persem , et al . , 2021 ; Gonen - Yaacovi et al . , 2013 ; Ovando - Tellez et al . , 2019 ) , they suggest that different prefrontal sub - regions , belonging to distinct networks , may support different creativity processes . In our study , we identiﬁed a brain region speciﬁcally associ - ated with CAT performance but not with AUT deﬁcit , although the whole group of patients were impaired in several AUT scores . High anatomical resolution methodologies and brain connectivity approaches should be considered in further Fig . 5 e Lesion - related deﬁcit in combining usual ideas is speciﬁc compared to divergent thinking abilities . Normalized scores ( from left to right : CAT accuracy , AUT ﬂuency , AUT frequency , AUT non - alternative uses number , and AUT creativity ) for patients with a lesion that overlap the ROI ( ROI þ , in red ) or not ( ROI ¡ , in blue ) .

Cognitive mapping in awake surgery or intra - cranial EEG analyses may be a promising methodology to advance this question . 5 . Limitation Our study is not without limitations . First , we did not have enough power to run whole - brain analyses , our sample sizes remained small and asymmetrical , and brain lesion locations were majorly left - lateralized . In addition , in our ROI - based approach , we did not have a priori lesion locations to test a speciﬁc effect for the AUT performance . The current literature did not provide ROI with a high spatial resolution , or unbiased by the type of patients used . However , we found at the group level ( independently of lesion location ) that patients showed , on average , a deﬁcit in producing original and creative ideas . It may suggest that divergent thinking requires a more exten - sive brain network , and that the rostro - lateral prefrontal cortex may be speciﬁcally involved in the combinatory pro - cesses allowing to solve a CAT . In Bendetowicz et al . ' s study ( 2018 ) , the authors also found the medial prefrontal cortex as a critical actor , speciﬁcally in generating distant associations of ideas . In the present study , only two patients had a lesion that overlapped the medial prefrontal cluster , preventing specif - ically testing the critical role of this brain region for solving CAT in our sample . However , these two patients showed poorer performance at the CAT . In addition , we found that patients with a lesion overlapping the rostro - lateral or rostro - medial prefrontal cortex were signiﬁcantly impaired in solv - ing CAT compared to patients with lesions elsewhere . Although we did not test the speciﬁc role of the medial pre - frontal cortex in the CAT , these results suggest that this brain region may also be critical in solving the CAT . Second , creativity assessment was conducted remotely after surgery , with delays between surgery and evaluation quite heterogeneous in our sample . Even if patients were still impaired in creative cognition , brain plasticity may have helped them recover their post - surgery acute impairments , minimizing deﬁcits in the long term . However , we still observed remotely after the brain surgery a deﬁcit in creative cognition whereas classical neuropsychological tests did not show any deﬁcit . The real impact in daily life of patients of the deﬁcits in creativity tasks were not speciﬁcally explored through targeted interviews . We will seriously consider this approach in future research . Finally , by analyzing only post - surgical deﬁcits , we inves - tigated surgery - related cognitive impairment . Another approach could be to use a within - subject design , testing pa - tients ' creativity before and after the surgery . In such a design , each patient would be their own control . It could help disen - tangle the part of creativity deﬁcits related to the lesion itself and the consequences of brain surgery , taking into account individual creativity level at baseline ( i . e . , before surgery ) . It may also better control potential confounding factors such as medications . However , it would require controlling the test - retest effect by developing alternative versions of our tasks for longitudinal testing . It may also better control potential confounding factors such as medications . 6 . Conclusion The present study provides evidence that patients with a low - grade glioma surgically resected showed a creativity deﬁcit . Speciﬁcally , these patients generated less original and crea - tive ideas , and were impaired in combining ( remote ) concepts in semantic memory if the rostro - lateral prefrontal cortex was affected . In addition to shedding new light on the neurosci - ence of creativity , our study highlighted the relevance of assessing high - order cognitive function , such as creativity , in clinical practice . This could lead to a better monitoring of surgical interventions and guide early rehabilitation .
