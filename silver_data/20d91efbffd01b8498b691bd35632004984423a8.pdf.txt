Chemokine receptors are well - known regulators of chemotaxis in leukocytes ; however , they can regulate several other activities in these cells . This information has been often neglected , probably due to the paramount role of chemotaxis in the immune system and in biology . Therefore , the experimental data available on the mechanisms used by chemokine receptors to regulate other functions of leukocytes is sparse . The results obtained in the study of the chemokine receptor CCR7 in dendritic cells ( DCs ) provide interesting information on this issue . CCR7 guides the DCs from the peripheral tissues to the lymph nodes , where these cells control T cell activation . CCR7 can regulate DC chemotaxis , survival , migratory speed , cytoarchitecture , and endocytosis . Biochemical and functional analyses show : ﬁrst , that CCR7 uses in DCs the PI3K / Akt pathway to control survival , the MAPK pathway to control chemotaxis , and the RhoA pathways to regulate actin dynamics , which in turn controls migratory speed , cytoarchitecture , and endocytosis ; second , that these three signaling pathways behave as modules with a high degree of independence ; and third , that although each one of these routes can regulate several functions in different settings , CCR7 promotes in DCs a functional bias in each pathway . The data uncover an interesting mechanism used by CCR7 to regulate the DCs , entailing multifunctional signaling pathways organized in modules with biased functionality . A similar mechanism could be used by other chemoattractant receptors to regulate the functions of leukocytes .

Based on this property , chemokine receptors , together with their ligands , serve as “address codes” that guide leukocytes to speciﬁc sites in the organism ( 1 – 3 ) . Although chemoattraction is an important activity controlled by these receptors , they can regulate additional functions of leukocytes ( 4 – 6 ) . This fact has been largely overlooked , probably due to the capital Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org 1 April 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 528 ﬁmmu - 11 - 00528 April 10 , 2020 Time : 20 : 36 # 2 Rodríguez - Fernández and Criado - García CCR7 Controls Dendritic Cells importance of chemoattraction in biology ; consequently , the information on other functions of chemokine receptors is sparse ( 6 ) . It is expected that non - chemotactic functions regulated by chemokine receptors may contribute to the eﬃcient functioning of leukocytes in the immune system . Therefore , getting insight into the molecular mechanisms used to regulate these functions may allow the identiﬁcation of novel targets to modulate the immune response . C – C chemokine receptor 7 , like all chemokine receptors , is included in the G protein - coupled receptor superfamily ( 6 ) . CCR7 ( ligands CCL19 and CCL21 ) is one of the chemokine receptors on which more functional information is available ( 6 – 8 ) . We have studied the signaling pathways controlling CCR7 - mediated functions in dendritic cells ( DCs ) . It was found that , to control speciﬁc cellular functions of DCs , this receptor uses well - known signaling pathways that organize as signaling modules with biased functionality and limited crosstalk among them ( 9 – 13 ) . Herein we describe the signaling components of these modules and discuss how they may regulate the functions of DCs . CCR7 - CONTROLLED NON - CHEMOTACTIC ACTIVITIES MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE EFFICIENCY OF DENDRITIC CELLS IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM Dendritic cells are leukocytes that are found in peripheral tissues in a diﬀerentiation state called immature , during which they display a high ability to detect , capture , and process antigens ( 14 ) . After exposure to danger signals , including pathogens , toxic agents , or inﬂammatory cytokines , immature DCs undergo a complex diﬀerentiation program that transforms them into mature DCs ( maDCs ) , which migrate to the lymph nodes ( LNs ) , where they present antigens captured in the immature stage to antigen - speciﬁc T cells . As part of their diﬀerentiation program , the maDCs upregulate the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7 that guides the maDCs to the LNs , attracted by CCL21 which is expressed in the aﬀerent lymphatics vessels and by CCL19 and CCL21 which are expressed in stromal cells in the LNs ( 15 , 16 ) . CCR7 is crucial to guide the maDCs to the LNs , implying that its correct expression and function is important for adequate adaptive immune response ( 15 , 17 – 21 ) . Apart from chemoattraction ( 8 , 22 , 23 ) , CCR7 regulates cytoarchitecture ( 13 , 24 ) , endocytosis ( 13 , 25 ) , survival ( 12 ) , migratory speed ( 11 , 26 ) , adhesion ( 27 ) , and diﬀerentiation in maDCs ( 28 ) . Predictably , these non - chemotactic activities regulated by CCR7 contribute to the correct functionality of the maDCs in the immune system ( 6 ) . It is expected that the enhanced survival , migratory speed , and diﬀerentiation may increase the number of antigen - loaded maDCs that reach the LNs . The increment in endocytosis may confer the maDCs migrating through the aﬀerent lymphatic vessels , or located in the LNs , the ability to endocyte antigens , e . g . , viral particles that can be subsequently presented to T cells ( 29 , 30 ) . Enhanced adhesion facilitates the migration of the maDCs through the aﬀerent lymphatic vessels ( 27 , 31 ) . The induced changes in actin cytoarchitecture can regulate the motility of the maDCs that migrate toward the LNs and confer these cells their dendritic morphology ( 11 , 13 , 24 ) . Pseudopod extensions increase the surface - area - to - volume ratio of the maDCs when compared with a spherical cell of equal volume ( 32 ) , increasing the possibilities of contact with T cells . In summary , the diﬀerent functions controlled by CCR7 may predictably contribute to a more eﬀective maDCs in the immune system and to a better adaptive immune response ( 6 ) . An important issue is the identiﬁcation of the mechanisms used by CCR7 to regulate the cellular activities of the maDCs . In the following sections , we discuss recent experimental data that provide information on the molecules and the signaling mechanism involved in this process . CCR7 - DEPENDENT SURVIVAL IS GOVERNED BY A PI3K / AKT - CONTROLLED SIGNALING MODULE When maDCs are kept in serum - free medium , they initiate an apoptotic program that leads to their demise ( 12 ) . This simple experimental setting is useful to identify the receptors that inhibit cellular apoptosis and the intracellular pathways involved ( 12 , 33 ) . The stimulation of maDC kept in serum - free medium with any of the ligands of CCR7 , CCL19 , or CCL21 slows down the apoptosis of these cells , indicating that this receptor induces anti - apoptotic intracellular signaling ( 12 ) . Using this experimental strategy , it was also found that the kinases AMPK and GSK3 β played pro - apoptotic roles in vitro and in vivo because a forced increase or decrease of their activities enhanced or impaired apoptosis in maDCs ( 9 , 10 , 34 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Moreover , it was found that AMPK promotes apoptosis in maDCs by inhibiting the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) , a kinase complex that promotes survival in maDCs ( see below ) ( 10 ) . Both AMPK and GSK3 β induce the activation of the transcription factors FOXO1 / 3 , which controls the pro - apoptotic Bcl2 family member Bim ( 9 , 10 , 12 , 35 ) . Moreover , active GSK3 β also prevents the activation of anti - apoptotic transcription factor NF κ B , which controls the transcription of the anti - apoptotic Bcl2 family member Bcl xl ( 9 ) ( Figure 1 ) . The balance between pro - apoptotic and anti - apoptotic Bcl2 family members determines whether a cell becomes apoptotic or survives ( 36 ) . An excessive increase in pro - apoptotic ( e . g . , Bim ) over pro - survival ( e . g . , Bcl xl ) Bcl2 members induces the activation of the mitochondria gatekeepers Bax / Bak ( 36 , 37 ) , resulting in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and liberation of cytochrome c from the intermembrane space of the mitochondria , which leads to caspase activation and apoptosis ( Figure 1 ) ( 36 ) . When CCR7 was stimulated in the maDCs that were in serum - free medium , it was observed that the pro - apoptotic signaling described above was turned oﬀ because this receptor induced the activation of the signaling axis PI3K / Akt ( 9 , 10 , 12 , 19 , 38 , 39 ) which , as shown below , is a core component of a pro - survival pathway in these cells ( Figure 1 ) .

Considering the sparse data within this ﬁeld , the ﬁgure should be considered as a tentative model to be completed as additional experimental information becomes available . The model is largely based on the data presented in Table 1 . Downstream of CCR7 , the PI3K / Akt , the MAPKs , and the RhoA pathways organize as signaling modules that regulate survival , chemotaxis , and actin dynamics , respectively ( see text for details ) .

The skull and crossbones symbol indicates molecules that promote apoptosis . dimer associated to the G α subunit to form a heterotrimeric G protein , mediate the CCR7 - dependent activation of the PI3K / Akt pathway ( 10 , 12 ) . This pathway induces survival in multiple cell types due to the ability of its signaling components , particularly Akt , to switch oﬀ pro - apoptotic molecules and turn on pro - survival signals ( 40 , 41 ) . Upon the CCR7 - dependent activation of Akt in maDCs , this kinase directly phosphorylates and inhibits the transcription factor FOXO1 / 3 which , as mentioned above , controls the expression of pro - apoptotic Bim ( 9 ) . Active Akt further prevents apoptosis by phosphorylating / inhibiting GSK3 β which , as mentioned before , promotes the activation of pro - apoptotic FOXO1 / 3 and also the inhibition of pro - survival NF κ B ( 9 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Akt also induces the activation of the transcription factor NF κ B , which regulates Bcl xl ( 9 , 12 ) that , as indicated above , protects the cells from apoptosis by opposing pro - apoptotic Bim ( Figure 1 ) . Akt can also enhance cell survival by inducing the activation of mTORC1 , which stimulates translation , a process that promotes survival in maDCs ( 42 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Active mTORC1 stimulates translation by inducing phosphorylation / inactivation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E ( eIF4E ) - binding protein 1 ( 4E - BP1 ) , which retains eIF - 4E inhibited . After the phosphorylation of 4E - BP1 , eIF - 4E is released and becomes part of the translation initiation complex ( 10 , 42 ) . Moreover , mTORC1 also activates translation by phosphorylating / activating ribosomal S6 kinase ( S6K ) , which subsequently phosphorylates the protein targets involved in translation , including the ribosomal protein S6 ( Figure 1 ) . The combined eﬀects of the activation of Akt , which Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org 3 April 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 528 ﬁmmu - 11 - 00528 April 10 , 2020 Time : 20 : 36 # 4 Rodríguez - Fernández and Criado - García CCR7 Controls Dendritic Cells leads to the up - regulation of Bcl xl , the inhibition of Bim and , in addition , the activation of mTORC1 , which promotes an increase in protein synthesis , contribute to extend the survival of the maDCs ( 10 , 42 ) . The prior results indicate that the PI3K / Akt pathway mediates CCR7 - dependent survival . Regarding the contribution of other pathways to the regulation of survival , a modest contribution of the chemotaxis pathway was observed because the inhibition of MEK1 / 2 / ERK1 / 2 , two key regulators of chemotaxis ( see below ) , reduced by ∼ 20 % the pro - survival eﬀects induced by CCR7 ( 10 ) . MEK1 / 2 / ERK1 / 2 may exert this moderate pro - survival eﬀect by inhibiting the pro - apoptotic kinase AMPK ( 10 ) ( Table 1 and Figure 1 ) . The inhibition of the PI3K / Akt pathway strikingly failed to aﬀect the CCR7 - dependent MAPK pathway ( Table 1 ) , the RhoA pathway , or the functions regulated by these two routes in maDCs ( Table 1 ) ( 9 , 10 , 12 ) . A lack of eﬀect of PI3K / Akt on CCR7 - regulated chemotaxis ( 19 , 39 ) or endocytosis ( see below ) has also been reported by other groups ( 39 ) . These results suggest that the PI3K / Akt pathway constitute a signaling module that largely controls CCR7 - induced survival , but no other CCR7 - mediated functions in maDCs ( see below ) . This is interesting because the PI3K / Akt pathway also regulates chemotaxis , proliferation , and metabolism in other cells ( 43 , 44 ) . This functional bias is also observed in the other two pathways controlled by CCR7 in maDCs ( see below ) . In summary , the data indicate that CCR7 controls in maDCs a PI3K / Akt - controlled signaling module that regulates survival , but not chemotaxis or actin dynamics ( see below ) . CCR7 - DEPENDENT CHEMOATTRACTION IS GOVERNED BY A MAPK - CONTROLLED SIGNALING MODULE Experimental evidence indicates that CCR7 - dependent chemotaxis is largely regulated by a signaling module formed by Raf and the MAPKs family members MEK1 / 2 , ERK1 / 2 , p38 , and JNK in maDCs ( 11 , 39 ) . As shown for CCR7 - induced survival , the activation of both the MAPK pathway and chemotaxis is regulated in maDCs by Gi proteins and G βγ dimers ( 11 ) . Previously , G βγ dimers have been shown to regulate chemotaxis in other chemokine receptors and cells ( 45 ) . Although it has not been experimentally analyzed if CCR7 induces the activation of Ras in maDCs , it is possible that this GTPase may mediate the eﬀects of CCR7 on the MAPK pathway because Ras is an upstream regulator of the Raf - MEK1 / 2 - ERK1 / 2 pathway ( 46 ) , and diﬀerent chemokine receptors can induce the activation of this GTPase ( 47 – 49 ) . Moreover , upon G - protein coupled receptor activation , Gi and G βγ dimers mediate , like in maDCs , the Ras - dependent activation of MAP kinase pathway ( 50 , 51 ) . In summary , the results indicate that the MAPK pathway controls CCR7 - dependent chemotaxis in maDCs ( 11 ) . However , the complete inhibition of ERK1 / 2 , p38 , and JNK does not abrogate chemotaxis , suggesting that additional regulator / s , denoted as “X” in Figure 1 , may also contribute to the regulation of this pathway ( 11 ) . The inhibition of key molecular components of the MAPK pathway does not aﬀect dramatically the CCR7 - dependent PI3K / Akt pathway and survival or the RhoA pathway and the function associated to it ( actin - regulated functions , including cytoarchitecture , endocytosis , and migratory speed ; see below ) ( Table 1 ) . Other authors have also shown that the stimulation of CCR7 induces the activation of JNK and that the inhibition of this MAPK blocks chemotaxis , but not the endocytosis in maDCs ( 39 ) , supporting the independence of the RhoA pathway ( see below ) of the chemotaxis regulatory module . In summary , the results suggest that the MAPK pathway may constitute a signaling module that displays a high degree of independence since it seems independent of the module that regulates CCR7 - regulated actin dynamics and displays only a very modest contribution to the regulation of CCR7 - controlled survival ( Figure 1 ) . Another interesting aspect that emerges from these results is the high degree of functional bias of the MAPK pathway , which seems to regulate mainly CCR7 - controlled chemotaxis and only modestly survival in maDC , although it is a potent regulator of survival and proliferation in other contexts ( 52 ) . The data suggesting that the MAPK pathway mediates CCR7 - dependent chemotaxis in maDCs is consistent with prior data showing that Ras , an upstream regulator of the MAPKs ( 46 ) , is a regulator of chemotaxis in response to N - formyl - L - methionyl - L - leucyl - L - phenylalanine ( fMLP ) in neutrophils ( 53 , 54 ) and to cyclic - adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) in Dictyostelium discoideum ( 55 , 56 ) . Moreover , in Dictyostelium , Ras activation takes place independently of PI3K ( 55 ) , which reminds of the observed independence between the CCR7 - regulated activation of MAPK and the PI3K / Akt pathways described in maDCs . In summary , the results indicate that CCR7 controls in maDCs a MAPK - regulated signaling module , which selectively controls chemotaxis , independently of the survival and actin - regulatory modules ( see below ) . CCR7 - DEPENDENT CHANGES IN ACTIN DYNAMICS IS GOVERNED BY A RhoA - CONTROLLED SIGNALING MODULE Our studies indicate that the CCR7 - induced stimulation of migratory speed , endocytosis , and changes in cytoarchitecture in maDCs is mediated by the RhoA pathway ( 11 , 13 ) . Thus RhoA , a key regulator of actin organization in multiple cells , including maDC ( 57 – 64 ) , would govern the actin dynamic changes involved in the control of the aforementioned activities . It has been suggested that RhoA does not mediate CCR7 - induced morphological changes and endocytosis in murine maDCs , which would be controlled instead by Cdc42 and Rac ( 24 , 25 ) . These discrepancies could be due to species diﬀerences [ murine maDCs ( 24 , 25 ) vs . human maDCs ( 11 , 13 ) ] or caused by the maturation stimulus used for the DCs [ LPS ( 24 , 25 ) vs . TNF α ( 11 , 13 ) ] . This issue will have to be settled in future studies . Unlike CCR7 - dependent survival and chemotaxis , which depend largely on Gi proteins , CCR7 - dependent changes in actin dynamics were Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org 4 April 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 528 ﬁmmu - 11 - 00528 April 10 , 2020 Time : 20 : 36 # 5 Rodríguez - Fernández and Criado - García CCR7 Controls Dendritic Cells TABLE 1 | Experimental data support a high degree of independence between the different CCR7 - regulated modules controlling the functions of the dendritic cells .

The maDCs were largely stimulated with CCL21 , but similar results were observed with CCL19 . Only 2D chemotactic analyses were performed . The maDCs , pretreated or not with the indicated inhibitor ( see below ) , were stimulated with CCL21 , and the activity of the signaling molecules or the cell functions were analyzed ( see below ) . In the two columns on the left - hand side of the table are shown , in red , the target proteins inhibited in each signaling pathway / module and the inhibitors used . The ﬁrst row of the table is divided in three blocks , denoting , in red , the module that is inhibited and , in black , the effects of this inhibition on the other two modules . Below these three blocks are shown from up to down : ( i ) the “target molecule” and the “target function” analyzed in each module ; ( ii ) the “control” , which indicates the effect that the stimulation of CCR7 with CCL21 exerts on the activity of the “target molecule” ( “activated” or “inhibited” ) or the “target function” ( “increase” or “changes” ) analyzed ; ( iii ) the “inhibitor effect” indicates whether the treatment with an inhibitor prevents or not the activation or inhibition observed in the “target molecule” or “target function” in the CCR7 - stimulated “control” . In the “target function , ” the percentage of inhibition of the function analyzed is also shown ( between parentheses ) ; and ( iv ) “Fig ( Ref ) ” , indicates the ﬁgure in the reference / s where the original data can be examined . When only the reference is included , this means that it was presented as a “results not shown” . Abbreviations : C3 , exoenzyme C3 that ADP - ribosylates and inhibits RhoA ; PRNK , is a dominant negative fragment derived from the kinase Pyk2 ; siRNA , small interfering RNA . Mst1 activity was inhibited by reducing its level with siRNA ( see other abbreviations in the legend of Figure 1 ) . found to be regulated both by Gi and G 13 family of G proteins ( Figure 1 ) . Interestingly , the kinase Mst1 connects Gi with RhoA , which is also downstream of G 13 ( 13 ) ( Figure 1 ) . These data are consistent with prior results indicating that the G 12 / 13 proteins control RhoA ( 65 ) . RhoA eﬀects are mediated by a pathway that controls actin dynamics , including actin polymerization ( ROCK - LIMK - coﬁlin ) and contraction ( ROCK / MLCP / MLC ) ( 57 , 59 , 61 ) ( Figure 1 ) . It was also observed that , downstream of CCR7 , RhoA controls the activation of the tyrosine kinase Pyk2 ( 11 ) ( Figure 1 ) , suggesting that this kinase can also mediate the eﬀects of RhoA on the actin cytoskeleton . Accordingly , other authors have suggested that Pyk2 is activated downstream of G 13 and that it is involved in the control of leukocyte motility and cytoarchitecture ( 66 , 67 ) . The selective blocking of the molecular components of the RhoA pathway in mDCs results in the inhibition of CCR7 - dependent migratory speed , endocytosis , and alterations of the cytoarchitecture ( 11 , 13 ) , suggesting that RhoA - controlled actin mediates these functions ( 58 , 61 ) . In summary , CCR7 controls two axes , namely , CCR7 / G 13 and CCR7 / G i / Mst1 , that converge on RhoA , which is upstream of a pathway that controls the actin dynamics involved in the regulation of migratory speed , endocytosis , and cytoarchitecture ( Figure 1 ) ( 11 , 13 , 57 , 60 ) . As shown for the other modules , the inhibition of speciﬁc signaling components of this pathway failed to aﬀect the chemotaxis or survival of the signaling components controlling these functions , supporting the independence of the CCR7 - dependent RhoA - regulated signaling module ( Table 1 ) ( 11 , 13 ) . Supporting that the actin dynamics regulatory module is independent of the chemotaxis module , it has been shown that the inhibition of the kinase ROCK fails to block the activation of the chemotaxis regulator JNK in maDCs ( 39 ) . The results together suggest that the CCR7 - regulated RhoA pathway behaves as a signaling module that displays a high degree of independence in maDCs . As shown with the other two modules , although in addition to actin dynamics , the RhoA pathway may regulate other cell functions , including survival and proliferation ( 62 ) ; however , CCR7 in maDCs apparently regulates largely actin dynamics . In summary , the RhoA - regulated module controls selectively CCR7 - dependent actin dynamics and the cellular activities associated to it , including migratory speed , endocytosis , and cytoarchitecture . Finally , the described independence between the chemotaxis and actin dynamics regulatory modules suggests that chemotaxis and motility are diﬀerent functions . The following results further support this concept . Using microﬂuidic devices , it has been shown that perturbing actin dynamics with actin and myosin inhibitors in mouse maDCs aﬀects the migratory speed , but not the chemotaxis in response to CCL19 ( 68 ) . The actin - associated protein mDia , which regulates actin dynamics , mediates migratory speed , but it is dispensable for 3D chemotaxis in response to CCL21 in murine maDCs ( 69 , 70 ) . In response to the external gradients of cAMP , in D . discoideum , a polarized localization of Ras is observed , and in neutrophils exposed to the gradients of fMLP , a polarization of phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate ( PIP3 ) also takes place . However , in Dictyostelium and human neutrophils exposed to these chemoattractants , Ras and PIP 3 still polarize , even when the cells were immobilized either on highly adherent substrates or by disrupting their actin cytoskeleton with latrunculin ( 53 , 55 ) . It has been shown that , although the actin - associated leading edge protein Arp2 / 3 , which regulates actin dynamics , is critical for lamellipodial formation and cell motility in ﬁbroblast and cancer cell lines , it is , however , dispensable for chemotaxis ( 71 , 72 ) . These examples suggest that perhaps it is more appropriate to deﬁne chemotaxis as “chemoattractant sensing” to separate it from motility , which could be a diﬀerent cell activity .

The results obtained suggest a high degree of independence between these pathways , although it is not complete because at least the chemotaxis and the survival modules are connected , with the former controlling modestly the latter . Albeit each one of the three pathways can regulate several functions in diﬀerent contexts ( 43 , 44 , 52 , 62 ) , CCR7 seems to select only one activity in maDCs . The molecular mechanisms supporting the independence and biased functionality of these pathways are not known . CCR7 regulates in maDCs other signaling molecules not analyzed in this review , e . g . , cyclic AMP , calcium , phospholipase C , Src , and others ( 11 , 19 , 73 ) . Future studies will determine their roles in the modules described or in others described in the future . Finally , the independent modular organization described could be one among several strategies used by chemokine receptors to regulate leukocyte functions because , for instance , the receptor CXCR4 uses redundant signaling to control survival and chemotaxis in maDCs ( 33 ) . In summary , the information gathered point out an interesting mechanism that could be used by multifunctional chemokine receptors to regulate the functions of leukocytes .
