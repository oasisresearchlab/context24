Louis , Missouri 63110 - 1010 The Niemann - Pick C1 ( NPC1 ) protein is a key partici - pant in intracellular sterol trafficking and regulation of cholesterol homeostasis . NPC1 contains a pentahelical re - gion that is evolutionarily related to sterol - sensing do - mains found in other polytopic proteins involved in sterol interactions or sterol metabolism , including sterol regu - latory element - binding protein cleavage - activating pro - tein and hydroxymethylglutaryl - CoA reductase . To gain insight into the role of the sterol - sensing domain of NPC1 , we examined the effect of point mutations in the NPC1 sterol - sensing domain on the trafficking of low density lipoprotein - derived cholesterol and sphingolipids . We show that an NPC1 P692S loss of function mutation re - sults in decreased cholesterol delivery to the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum . By contrast , NPC1 proteins carrying a L657F or D787N point mutation , which correspond to the activating SCAP L315F and D443N mutations , respectively , exhibit a gain of function phenotype . Specifically , cell lines expressing the NPC1 L657F or D787N mutations show a nearly 2 - fold increase in the rates of low density lipoprotein cholesterol traffick - ing to the plasma membrane and to the endoplasmic re - ticulum , and more rapid suppression of sterol regulatory element - binding protein - dependent gene expression . Trafficking of sphingolipids is intact in the D787N and L657F cell lines . Our finding that D787N and L657F are activating NPC1 mutations provide evidence for a con - served mechanism for the sterol - sensing domain among cholesterol homeostatic proteins . Niemann - Pick type C ( NPC ) 1 disease is a fatal , autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder characterized by lysosomal cho - lesterol accumulation and defective regulation of cellular choles - terol homeostasis ( 1 , 2 ) . 95 % of NPC disease cases are caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene , which encodes a 1278 - amino acid polytopic protein containing 13 transmembrane domains ( 3 ) . The region of the NPC1 protein encompassing transmembrane do - mains 3 – 7 ( amino acids 615 – 797 ) is evolutionarily related to sterol - sensing domains found in five other polytopic proteins that are involved in sterol interactions or sterol metabolism ( 4 ) . The NPC1 sterol - sensing domain shares (cid:1) 30 % identity with the ste - rol - sensing domains of HMG - CoA reductase , SREBP cleavage - activating protein ( SCAP ) , NPC1 - L1 , and Patched ( 5 ) . A carbox - yl - terminal dileucine motif targets NPC1 to the endocytic pathway , where it localizes to a late endosomal compartment that is LAMP - 2 - positive , Rab7 - positive , and cation - independent mannose - 6 - P receptor - negative ( 6 – 8 ) . The NPC1 protein is a key participant in intracellular sterol trafficking . Cells harboring inactivating mutations in NPC1 are defective in the delivery of newly hydrolyzed low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol to the plasma membrane ( PM ) , demonstrate impaired rates of esterification of LDL choles - terol , and accumulate unesterified cholesterol in an aberrant late endosomal / lysosomal compartment ( 9 – 11 ) . Conversely , overexpression of NPC1 results in dose - dependent increases in delivery of endosomal cholesterol to the PM and in esterifica - tion of LDL cholesterol ( 10 ) . The sterol trafficking defect in cells that have inactivating mutations in NPC1 further results in delayed down - regulation of the LDL receptor and de novo cholesterol biosynthesis ( 12 – 14 ) . These sterol regulatory de - fects correlate with a deficiency in LDL cholesterol - stimulated production of 25 - hydroxycholesterol ( 25 - HC ) and 27 - hydroxy - cholesterol ( 27 - HC ) ( 14 ) . These enzymatically generated oxy - sterols reduce the cellular cholesterol burden by suppressing sterol regulatory element - binding protein ( SREBP ) - dependent gene expression and by serving as ligands for liver X receptors . Treatment of NPC1 mutant fibroblasts with either 25 - HC or 27 - HC corrects the sterol homeostatic defects and mobilizes accumulated unesterified cholesterol ( 14 , 15 ) . Taken together , these findings suggest that NPC1 regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis by channeling excess LDL cholesterol to sites of oxysterol synthesis ( 2 , 14 ) . Cholesterol that traffics as bulk cargo in the endocytic path - way also plays a role in modulating late endosomal function . Cholesterol overload delays retroendocytic clearance of fluid - phase markers and alters the rate of cholesterol movement along this pathway ( 6 ) . Whereas the mechanism by which cholesterol regulates NPC1 function is not known , recent stud - ies of homologous proteins ( HMG - CoA reductase , SCAP , and Patched ) indicate that the sterol - sensing domain is involved in regulating sterol - dependent protein - protein interactions . HMG - CoA reductase catalyzes the rate - limiting step in de novo cholesterol biosynthesis , and SCAP regulates the activity of the * The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges .

In both HMG - CoA reductase and SCAP , the sterol - sensing domains modulate sterol - dependent interactions with the resident endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) pro - teins , Insig - 1 and Insig - 2 ( 16 ) . Sterol - stimulated binding of the Insig proteins to HMG - CoA reductase results in its ubiquitina - tion and subsequent proteosomal degradation . Similarly , Insig proteins bind to SCAP in the presence of cholesterol , leading to retention of SCAP - SREBP complexes in the ER , thereby pre - venting proteolytic processing of SREBPs and expression of genes involved in cholesterol uptake and biosynthesis ( 17 , 18 ) . The role of the sterol - sensing domain of Patched , a morphogen that binds members of the hedgehog family of signaling pro - teins and regulates the activity of the Smoothened seven - pass membrane protein , has not been fully elucidated , but recent studies suggest that it may function to regulate the vesicular trafficking of Patched between the PM and endosomes ( 19 , 20 ) . Cells harboring the Y298C , L315F , or D443N point mutations in SCAP demonstrate a sterol - resistant phenotype , character - ized by cholesterol overload because of constitutive processing of SREBP ( 21 ) . Furthermore , the Y298C and D443N SCAP mutants are resistant to conformational changes normally in - duced by cholesterol , and the Y298C mutant fails to bind the Insig - 1 and Insig - 2 retention proteins ( 21 , 22 ) . Similarly , the corresponding mutation in Patched ( D584N ) produces a domi - nant negative protein and prevents the down - regulation of Smoothened activity ( 19 ) . In HMG - CoA reductase , mutations in the YIYF motif of the sterol - sensing domain , which corre - spond to the SCAP Y298C substitution , confer resistance to sterol - mediated degradation ( 16 ) . The role of the sterol - sensing domain of NPC1 in intracellu - lar cholesterol trafficking is not yet understood . Expression of the P691S point mutant in human NPC1 ( P692S in the murine ortholog ) results in an NPC1 protein that is properly targeted to the late endosome , but fails to correct the sterol trafficking defect ( 23 , 24 ) . The P692S loss of function mutant also exhibits severely reduced labeling with a photoactivatable cholesterol ( 25 ) . These findings indicate that an intact sterol - sensing do - main is required for cholesterol binding and NPC1 protein function . In the present study , we examined the effects of point mutations in the NPC1 sterol - sensing domain on the traffick - ing of LDL - derived cholesterol and sphingolipids . We provide evidence that NPC1 proteins carrying point mutations corre - sponding to the activating SCAP L315F and D443N mutations are fully functional , and exhibit increased rates of LDL choles - terol trafficking to the PM and ER . These data demonstrate the functional importance of the NPC1 sterol - sensing domain in regulation of LDL cholesterol trafficking in mammalian cells , and are consistent with the hypothesis that this domain of NPC1 functions in a manner analogous to the homologous domains in SCAP and HMG - CoA reductase .

To isolate clonal cell lines , the retrovirally infected M12 cells were plated at limiting dilution and colonies were subjected to two rounds of screening . Colonies were first screened by filipin staining ( described under “Fluorescence Microscopy” ) and by cyan fluorescent protein ( CFP ) fluorescence . Colonies were also screened for expression of mNPC1 by Western blotting of TNET lysates using an antibody that recognizes CFP ( described under “Protein Preparation and Western Blot Analysis” ) .

A chromatography recovery standard was added ( 30 (cid:2) g of cholesteryl oleate , 0 . 0005 (cid:2) Ci of [ 14 C ] cholesteryl oleate ) , and the samples were dried under nitrogen . The lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography ( TLC ) on PE SIL G plates ( Whatman ) , using heptane / ethyl ether / acetic acid ( 90 : 30 : 1 ) as the solvent . Lipids were visualized using iodine . [ 3 H ] Cholesteryl oleate was quantified by liquid scintillation counting in Ecoscint ( National Diagnostics ) .

Cells were then washed three times with PBS , refed medium B , and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h , followed by a 10 - min incubation with medium B containing 4 % CD at 37 °C . Media was collected , cells were washed three times with Tris - buffered saline at 4 °C , and cells were extracted with 0 . 1 N NaOH . A recovery standard ( 0 . 0005 (cid:2) Ci of [ 14 C ] cholesteryl oleate , 80 (cid:2) g of cholesterol , 30 (cid:2) g of cholesteryl oleate ) was added to media samples and lipids were ex - tracted using chloroform / methanol ( 2 : 1 ) . Media extracts were dried under N 2 and [ 3 H ] cholesterol was quantified by TLC and scintillation counting . Because there were no differences in the rate of [ 3 H ] CL hydrolysis among the cell lines studied ( not shown ) , total 3 H label in the cells was quantified by scintillation counting of NaOH cell extracts .

RESULTS Generation of Cell Lines Expressing NPC1 - CFP Fusion Pro - teins— The sterol - sensing domain of NPC1 shares 30 % identity with homologous regions of HMG - CoA reductase , SCAP , and Patched ( Fig . 1 ) . To investigate the function of this domain , we introduced the following point mutations into NPC1 : P692S , Y635C , D787N , and L657F . Based on earlier studies , we antic - ipated that the P692S substitution would result in NPC1 loss of function ( 23 , 24 ) . On the other hand , we hypothesized that the Y635C , D787N , and L657F substitutions , which involve con - served residues in the sterol - sensing domain ( see asterisks in Fig . 1 ) and induce a sterol - resistant phenotype in HMG - CoA reductase and SCAP , would result in NPC1 gain of function . For these studies , a retroviral expression system was used to establish cell lines expressing CFP - tagged WT and mutant versions of NPC1 in the NPC1 - null M12 CHO cell line ( 10 ) . (cid:2) U3 retroviral constructs were transfected into 293GPG pack - aging cells to produce virus encoding WT and mutant NPC1 ( 26 ) . This virus was used to infect both WT CHO and NPC1 - null M12 cells to generate populations of cells stably expressing the NPC1 - CFP constructs at various levels . These populations were used for initial fluorescence microscopy studies ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) . Mutations in the SSD of NPC1 Do Not Induce Dominant Inhibitory Effects— Because it is not known whether NPC1 carries out its cellular functions through a mechanism involv - ing protein - protein interactions , it was first important to de - termine whether any of the NPC1 - CFP constructs could induce dominant inhibitory effects in WT cells . Populations of WT CHO cells transduced with the NPC1 - WT - CFP and mutant NPC1 - CFP constructs were stained with filipin to visualize unesterified cholesterol , and examined by fluorescence micros - copy . CHO cells express endogenous NPC1 and were therefore an appropriate background to use for these experiments ( 10 , 11 , 31 ) . As shown in Fig . 2 , the enlarged , filipin - positive struc - tures present in NPC1 - null CHO cells are not observed in the WT CHO cells , cells transduced with the NPC1 - WT - CFP , or cells transduced with any of the four mutant NPC1 - CFP con - structs . In cells expressing the NPC1 - CFP constructs , filipin staining is observed at the cell periphery and in a Golgi - like pattern similar to the pattern observed in non - transduced cells . NPC1 - CFP appears primarily in a granular pattern , consistent the established late endosomal distribution of endogenous NPC1 in WT CHO cells ( 8 , 10 ) . These results indicate that both Fig . 2 . NPC1 sterol - sensing domain mutations do not induce dominant inhibitory effects in WT CHO cells . NPC1 - null CHO cells , and WT CHO cells ( non - transduced or populations transduced with CFP - tagged WT NPC1 , P692S NPC1 , Y635C NPC1 , D787N NPC1 , or L657F NPC1 ) were plated on coverslips in medium A on day 0 . On day 1 , cells were fixed , stained with 50 (cid:2) g / ml filipin , and examined by fluorescence microscopy . Bar (cid:8) 10 (cid:2) m . Function of NPC1 Sterol - sensing Domain 28584 WT and mutant forms of NPC1 are appropriately localized when expressed in WT CHO cells and that none of these con - structs is capable of inducing the NPC phenotype in the pres - ence of a functional copy of NPC1 . NPC1 - D787N - CFP and NPC1 - L657F - CFP Can Correct Free Cholesterol Accumulation in NPC1 - null Cells— Further fluores - cence microscopy studies were carried out to determine whether the sterol - sensing domain mutants were capable of correcting the accumulation of free cholesterol ( i . e . the NPC phenotype ) in NPC1 - null M12 cells . As expected , NPC1 - WT - CFP , but not NPC1 - P692S - CFP , was able to complement the mutant pheno - type of the NPC1 - null cells ( Fig . 3 ) . Expression of either the NPC1 - D787N - CFP or NPC1 - L657F - CFP putative gain of func - tion mutants complemented NPC1 - null cells as well , indicating that introduction of these substitutions does not diminish NPC1 function . Expression of the putative gain of function NPC1 - Y635C - CFP resulted in only partial complementation of the NPC phenotype . This may be related to lower levels of expression of NPC1 - Y635C - CFP in WT CHO and NPC1 - null M12 cells , as compared with the other sterol - sensing domain mutants ( data not shown ) , or to reduced levels of mature NPC1 glycoprotein ( 23 ) . In NPC1 - null M12 cells transduced with the WT , D787N , or L657F constructs , NPC1 - CFP again localized primarily to gran - ular structures . In NPC1 - null M12 cells transduced with the P692S construct , by contrast , NPC1 - CFP localized to the limiting membrane of cholesterol - rich , filipin - positive structures ( Figs . 3 and 7 ) , similar to the distribution of NPC1 observed following pharmacologic induction of the NPC phenotype ( 10 ) . This stain - ing pattern is not observed in WT CHO cells transduced with the P692S construct ( see Fig . 2 ) . Isolation of Clonal Cell Lines Expressing NPC1 - CFP Mutant Proteins— Clonal cell lines were isolated from the NPC1 - null cell populations transduced with the WT and mutant NPC1 con - structs by plating at limiting dilution . The clonal cell lines were used for all subsequent fluorescence microscopy studies and for all biochemical studies . The clones were screened for expression of CFP by fluorescence microscopy and by Western blotting of cell lysates using an affinity purified mouse monoclonal antibody to GFP . Clones with similar levels of CFP expression and predom - inantly endosomal CFP staining patterns ( WT , D787N , and L657F cell lines ) or NPC1 staining of the periphery of filipin - positive compartments ( P692S cell lines ) were selected for fur - ther study . Because of the low level of stable expression of the NPC1 - Y635C - CFP construct , as compared with the other sterol - sensing domain constructs , the Y635C substitution was not ex - amined further in the context of clonal cell lines . As determined by densitometry of four independent Western blots , the clonal cell lines transduced with the P692S , D787N , and L657F con - structs express CFP - tagged NPC1 proteins at levels that do not differ significantly from levels of NPC1 - CFP expression in the cell line transduced with NPC1 - WT - CFP ( see Fig . 4 ) . The clonal cell lines will be referred to hereafter as null / WT , null / P692S , null / D787N , and null / L657F . Delivery of LDL Cholesterol from Endosomes to the Plasma Membrane Is Increased in the Null / D787N and Null / L657F Cell Lines— To characterize the effects of the sterol - sensing domain mutations on trafficking of endocytosed LDL cholesterol , we first Fig . 3 . NPC1 - WT - CFP , NPC1 - D787N - CFP , and NPC1 - L657F - CFP correct the cholesterol accumulation phenotype of NPC1 - null cells . NPC1 - null CHO cells ( non - transduced or populations trans - duced with CFP - tagged WT NPC1 , P692S NPC1 , Y635C NPC1 , D787N NPC1 , or L657F NPC1 ) were plated on coverslips in medium A on day 0 . On day 1 , cells were fixed , stained with 50 (cid:2) g / ml filipin , and exam - ined by fluorescence microscopy . Arrowheads denote transfected cells with partial ( Y635C ) or complete complementation ( WT , D787N , and L657F ) . Bar (cid:8) 10 (cid:2) m . Function of NPC1 Sterol - sensing Domain 28585 examined rates of delivery of LDL cholesterol to the PM choles - terol pool . For these studies , delivery of newly hydrolyzed LDL cholesterol to the PM was monitored by efflux to CD , an efficient extracellular cholesterol acceptor . Cells were loaded with [ 3 H ] CL - LDL at 16 – 18 °C . At this temperature , there is no sig - nificant hydrolysis of LDL cholesteryl esters and trafficking of free cholesterol from late endosomes is prevented ( 32 ) . Brief incubations with CD enabled sampling of cholesterol predomi - nantly associated with the PM pool , rather than with intracellu - lar membranes ( 29 , 33 ) . As expected , the null / P692S cells had significantly impaired delivery of LDL cholesterol to the PM , similar to that reported previously for NPC1 - null cells ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) ( 9 – 11 ) . In contrast , null / D787N and null / L657F cells , as compared with null / WT cells , demonstrated significantly in - creased rates of delivery of cholesterol to the PM at both 20 (cid:2) g / ml LDL ( 1 . 3 – 1 . 4 - fold ) and 40 (cid:2) g / ml LDL ( 1 . 6 – 1 . 9 - fold ) . The in - creased delivery of cholesterol to the PM is comparable with the 1 . 6 - fold increase observed in NPC1 - overexpressing CHO cells ( 10 ) . To exclude the possibility that the enhanced cholesterol efflux in the null / D787N and null / L657F cells was because of increased accessibility of PM cholesterol to CD , null / WT , null / D787N , and null / L657F cells were labeled to equilibrium with [ 3 H ] cholesterol , and incubated with CD under the same condi - tions used for the efflux assay . We found that the CD - accessible cholesterol pool in null / D787N and null / L657F cells was de - creased by 23 and 20 % , respectively , as compared with the null / WT cells ( Fig . 5 C ) . Differences in cholesterol esterification rates are unlikely to have contributed to the reduced CD - accessible cholesterol pool in null / D787N and null / L657F cells because (cid:9) 0 . 05 % of cell - associated [ 3 H ] cholesterol was esterified under these experimental conditions ( not shown ) . Thus , the increased rate of cholesterol delivery to the PM in the null / D787N and null / L657F cells cannot be attributed to an increase in CD - accessible cholesterol . Because NPC1 is known to participate in delivery of LDL cholesterol from endosomes to the PM , the sterol trafficking phenotype of the D787N and L657F mutants is consistent with a gain of func - tion phenotype . Rates of Cholesterol Esterification Are Increased in the D787N and L657F Mutants— To determine the effects of the sterol - sensing domain mutations on trafficking of LDL choles - terol to the ER , we compared rates of LDL - stimulated esterifi - cation in the null / WT , null / P692S , null / D787N , and null / L657F clonal cell lines . In WT cells , uptake of LDL cholesterol expands the cellular cholesterol pool and activates acyl - CoA : cholesterol O - acyltransferase , which catalyzes the esterification of both de novo synthesized and LDL - derived cholesterol in the ER ( 34 ) . For these experiments , cells were fed 0 – 40 (cid:2) g / ml LDL over - night , pulsed for 2 h with [ 3 H ] oleate , and esterification rates were determined by measuring the incorporation of [ 3 H ] oleate into [ 3 H ] cholesteryl oleate . As compared with null / WT cells , null / P692S cells demonstrate a marked reduction in the rate of LDL - stimulated cholesterol esterification at concentrations of LDL above 10 (cid:2) g / ml ( Fig . 6 A ) . In contrast , cholesterol esterifi - cation rates in null / D787N and null / L657F cells are increased by up to 2 - and 1 . 7 - fold , respectively , as compared with WT . Similar LDL cholesterol esterification results were obtained using independently isolated clonal cell lines ( not shown ) . The increased rates of cholesterol esterification in the null / D787N and null / L657F cells are specific for LDL cholesterol because rates of 25 - HC - stimulated cholesterol esterification do not dif - fer significantly between null / WT and null / D787N or null / L657F cells ( Fig . 6 B ) . To exclude the possibility that in - creased LDL cholesterol esterification in null / D787N and null / L657F cells was because of increased LDL uptake , we measured LDL receptor activity in these cell lines . We found no difference in the rate of uptake in null / WT versus null / D787N and null / L657F cells ( Fig . 6 C ) . The increased LDL receptor activity in the null / P692S cells reflects the impaired suppression of SREBP - dependent gene expression that is characteristic of the NPC1 - null phenotype ( 12 – 14 ) . To exam - ine the consequence of increased cholesterol delivery to the ER in the null / D787N and null / L657F cells , we measured expression of the sterol - regulated gene , HMG - CoA synthase , in response to LDL cholesterol . We find that null / D787N and null / L657F cells show a greater suppression of HMG - CoA synthase expression than null / WT cells , consistent with the more rapid delivery of LDL cholesterol to ER membranes in these mutants ( Fig . 6 D ) . Taken together , the esterification and gene expression data are consistent with the previous observation of increased LDL cholesterol esterification rates in CHO cells overexpressing WT NPC1 ( 10 ) , and suggest that the D787N and L657F substitutions in the sterol - sensing domain confer NPC1 gain of function . Sphingolipid Trafficking Is Intact in the D787N and L657F Mutants— The trafficking of BODIPY - LacCer , a fluorescent sphingolipid analog , was examined by fluorescence microscopy to assess the trafficking of sphingolipids in the clonal cell lines expressing the NPC1 sterol - sensing domain mutants . It has been established previously that in pulse - chase experiments , BODIPY LacCer localizes to the aberrant late endosomal “NPC compartment” in skin fibroblasts derived from NPC patients , but localizes to the Golgi complex in skin fibroblasts derived from non - affected individuals ( 30 ) . Thus , we expected that in F IG . 4 . Expression of WT , P692S , D787N , and L657F NPC1 in clonal NPC1 - null cell lines . A , populations of NPC1 - null CHO cells expressing NPC1 - WT - CFP , NPC1 - P692S - CFP , NPC1 - D787N - CFP , or NPC1 - L657F - CFP were plated at limiting dilution and individual colonies were screened for the expression of NPC1 - CFP by Western blotting using an (cid:3) - GFP monoclonal antibody that recognizes CFP . Clonal cell lines having similar levels of CFP expression were chosen for use in subsequent biochemical experiments . B , CFP expression levels in these clonal cell lines were evaluated by densitometry . Values are mean expression levels from four independent Western blots (cid:7) S . E . and have been normalized to expression of NPC1 - WT - CFP . p (cid:8) not significant for WT versus mutant cell lines . Function of NPC1 Sterol - sensing Domain 28586 similar pulse - chase experiments in the null / WT cells , the BODIPY LacCer would localize to the Golgi complex , whereas in the null / P692S cells , the BODIPY LacCer would localize to the filipin - and CFP - positive late endosomal compartments ( see Fig . 3 ) . Indeed , in the null / WT cells , the BODIPY - LacCer predominantly co - localized with the Texas Red - lentil lectin ( LcH ) Golgi marker in a crescentic , perinuclear staining pat - tern ( Fig . 7 ) . Filipin staining revealed localization of choles - terol primarily to the PM and Golgi in the null / WT cells , and NPC1 - WT - CFP appeared in a punctate , late endosomal pat - tern ( not shown ) . By comparison , in the null / P692S cells , BODIPY LacCer co - localized with NPC1 - P692S - CFP to the filipin - positive aberrant NPC compartment . The Texas Red - LcH Golgi marker ( which has a carbohydrate specificity of (cid:3) - mannose and other carbohydrate moieties ) also appeared to partially co - localize to this compartment ( not shown ) , con - sistent with the hypothesis that there is an accumulation of glycolipids , as well as cholesterol , in the NPC compartment . Interestingly , in the null / D787N and null / L657F cells , BODIPY LacCer co - localized with the Texas Red - LcH Golgi marker , in a pattern that was indistinguishable from stain - ing in null / WT cells . These findings indicate that sphingo - lipid trafficking is intact in the L657F - and D787N - expressing cells . DISCUSSION In this study we examined the function of the NPC1 sterol - sensing domain in trafficking of LDL - derived cholesterol and sphingolipids . NPC1 proteins harboring P692S , D787N , or L657F mutations in this domain are expressed and appropri - ately localize to late endosomes . The P692S substitution results in a loss of function phenotype , characterized by failure to traffic LDL cholesterol from late endosomes , and accumulation of free cholesterol and sphingolipids in an aberrant endosomal F IG . 5 . Increased delivery of LDL cholesterol to the PM in clonal cell lines expressing NPC1 - D787N and NPC1 - L657F . A , to measure fractional efflux , cells were plated in medium A on day 0 .

E . and are representative of three independent experiments . Function of NPC1 Sterol - sensing Domain 28587 compartment to which NPC1 - P692S also localizes . By contrast , expression of NPC1 proteins with D787N or L657F substitu - tions , which correspond to activating mutations in the sterol - sensing domains of SCAP and HMG - CoA reductase , results in increased delivery of endocytosed LDL cholesterol to the PM and ER . Targeting of sphingolipids to the Golgi is intact in cell lines expressing the D787N or L657F mutations . The gain of function sterol trafficking phenotype induced by the D787N and L657F mutations provides evidence for a conserved sterol - sensing domain mechanism among these evolutionarily related cholesterol homeostatic proteins . Structure - function studies of the NPC1 protein have shown previously that an intact sterol - sensing domain is required for NPC1 function . The NPC1 P692S mutant expressed in NPC1 - null cells is unable to mobilize lysosomal free cholesterol or stimulate late endosomal vesicular trafficking ( 23 , 24 ) . Our results with the NPC1 P692S mutant showing markedly im - paired delivery of LDL cholesterol to the PM and the ER are consistent with these findings . Although this proline is invari - ant among the NPC1 , SCAP , HMG - CoA reductase , and Patched proteins ( Fig . 1 ) , it is not known whether the role this residue is conserved with respect to the sterol - sensing domain mechanism , because the effect of the corresponding mutation has not been reported in other sterol - sensing do - main - containing proteins . However , the recent demonstra - tion that NPC1 - P692S fails to label with a photoactivatable cholesterol analog ( 25 ) indicates that Pro - 692 is critical ei - ther for direct binding of cholesterol or for proper conforma - tion of the pentahelical sterol - sensing domain to facilitate interaction with cholesterol .

Asterisk indicates p (cid:4) 0 . 02 for WT versus L657F . Function of NPC1 Sterol - sensing Domain 28588 To date , examination of putative activating mutations in NPC1 in mammalian cells have focused on the Y635C muta - tion , which corresponds to the Y298C mutation in SCAP . In previous studies , expression of NPC1 - Y635C in NPC1 - null cells either failed to mobilize cholesterol from the NPC compart - ment , or resulted in only partial complementation of the mu - tant phenotype ( 23 , 24 ) . More recently , Ohgami et al . demon - strated that introduction of the Y635C substitution abolished labeling of NPC1 with a photoactivatable cholesterol analog , although the trafficking function of NPC1 - Y635C was not ex - amined in this study ( 25 ) . The low levels of expression of the Y635C mutation and reliance on a complementation assay that is well suited for identification of loss of function mutations , but not activating mutations ( 23 ) , may have limited the ability to detect a possible gain of function phenotype for the Y635C mutation . Likewise , in this study we found that NPC1 - Y635C is poorly expressed in comparison to the WT protein , thus confounding evaluation of the consequences of this mutation on sterol trafficking . In the present study , we characterized the effect of the D787N and L657F substitutions , which correspond to the D443N and L315F activating mutations in SCAP , on NPC1 function . Using quantitative sterol trafficking assays , we show for the first time that the D787N and L657F substitutions result in a sterol trafficking - related gain of function phenotype . As compared with cells expressing similar levels of WT NPC1 , the D787N and L657F mutants exhibit an (cid:1) 1 . 6 – 1 . 9 - fold in - crease in the rate of delivery of endosomal cholesterol to the PM and up to 2 - and 1 . 7 - fold increases , respectively , in the rate of LDL - stimulated cholesterol esterification , indicative of en - hanced NPC1 function . Nearly identical increases in sterol trafficking rates have been observed in CHO cell lines with 10 – 15 - fold overexpression of WT NPC1 ( 10 ) . Additionally , we show that sphingolipid trafficking is intact in the gain of func - tion mutants . Whether the D787N and L657F substitutions also represent activating mutations with respect to sphingo - lipid trafficking could not be determined on the basis of the qualitative BODIPY - LacCer trafficking assay used in our study . Together with the demonstration that NPC1 binds a cholesterol analog ( 25 ) , our findings suggest that the NPC1 sterol - sensing domain functions in a fashion similar to the homologous region in SCAP . Our results clearly suggest a regulatory role for the NPC1 sterol - sensing domain in intracellular movement of LDL cho - lesterol cargo in CHO cells . Interestingly , mutagenesis studies of the sterol - sensing domain of the NPC1 yeast ortholog , Ncr1p , have suggested a role for this region in cellular sphingolipid trafficking ( 35 ) . In yeast , expression of the Y718D mutant , which corresponds to the mammalian SCAP D443N mutation , resulted in redistribution of PM - derived sphingolipids to the vacuole and other subcellular compartments , although no al - terations in sterol metabolism were observed in this mutant . This contrasts with our finding that expression of the corre - sponding D787N mutation in NPC1 leads to increased rates of sterol trafficking and does not inhibit sphingolipid trafficking in CHO cells . There are several possible explanations for these divergent findings . Significant differences exist between yeast and multicellular organisms with respect to the trafficking and metabolism of sterols . First , unlike mammalian cells , which obtain cholesterol through uptake of lipoproteins , budding yeast do not take up exogenous sterol during aerobic growth . In addition , yeast utilize ergosterol rather than cholesterol to meet their membrane requirements . Second , in yeast mem - brane sterol appears to traffic directly to the ER , by - passing the vacuole . This contrasts with the itinerary for cholesterol in mammalian cells , in which lipoprotein - associated cholesterol is internalized by receptor - mediated endocytosis and is trafficked to late endosome / lysosomes . Third , deletion of Ncr1p in yeast indicates that this protein is not required for endocytic trans - port and sterol metabolism in yeast , because unlike in mam - malian cells , such a deletion does not promote sterol accumu - lation in the vacuole ( 35 , 36 ) . However , when Ncr1p is expressed in NPC1 - null CHO cells , it is able to suppress the mutant phenotype , indicating that the yeast ortholog is com - petent with respect to sterol trafficking ( 35 ) . Whether expres - sion of WT Ncr1p , which possesses a tyrosine at position 718 rather than the invariant aspartic acid residue found in the homologous regions of NPC1 , SCAP , and HMG - CoA reduc - tase , or the Ncr1p Y718D mutant would result in a sterol - related gain of function phenotype in CHO cells remains to be determined . It may be that the distinct yeast and mammalian phenotypes resulting from sterol - sensing domain mutations reflect differences in cellular sterol metabolism rather than intrinsic differences in the function of the NPC1 protein orthologs . Several lines of evidence suggest a conserved function for the sterol - sensing domain among NPC1 , SCAP , and HMG - CoA reductase . First , this domain shares 30 % identity and is topo - logically identical among these cholesterol homeostatic pro - F IG . 7 . Sphingolipids appropriately traffic to the Golgi in clonal cell lines expressing NPC1 - D787N and NPC1 - L657F , but not NPC1 - P692S . NPC1 - WT , NPC1 - D787N , NPC1 - L657F , and NPC1 - P692S cells were plated in medium A on day 0 . On day 1 , cells were pulsed for 45 min with 5 (cid:2) M BODIPY LacCer in 1 % fetal bovine serum in DMEM , followed by a 60 - min chase . Following back exchange with fatty acid - free BSA , cells were fixed and stained with filipin . Cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy for cholesterol , Texas Red - conju - gated lentil lectin ( to identify the Golgi ) , NPC1 - CFP , and BODIPY - LacCer . For each set of panels ( cholesterol , lectin , and LacCer or cho - lesterol , NPC1 - CFP , and LacCer ) the images are from a single field . For WT , D787N , and L657F arrowheads show co - localization of LacCer with cholesterol and the lentil lectin Golgi marker . For P692S , arrowheads show co - localization of LacCer with NPC1 - CFP and cholesterol in the aberrant lysosomal compartment . Bar (cid:8) 10 (cid:2) m . Function of NPC1 Sterol - sensing Domain 28589 teins ( 5 ) . Second , overexpression of the sterol - sensing domain of SCAP prevents sterol - mediated degradation of HMG - CoA reductase , implying that both proteins compete for binding to the Insig proteins ( 37 ) . Likewise , overexpression of NPC1 re - sults in resistance to sterol - mediated suppression of gene ex - pression , possibly by interfering with binding of SCAP to its retention protein ( 10 ) . Third , together with previous studies , our results demonstrate that introduction of mutations at con - served residues in the sterol - sensing domains of NPC1 , SCAP , and HMG - CoA reductase confers gain of function phenotypes with respect to cholesterol metabolism . Our findings support the following model for the role of NPC1 in regulation of cellular cholesterol trafficking . In the setting of lipoprotein deprivation , NPC1 participates in basal movement of lipid cargo from the late endosome . As cholesterol content in endosomal membranes increases , for example , in response to LDL cholesterol loading , NPC1 may bind choles - terol and / or undergo a conformational change that induces binding to a putative Insig - like protein , analogous to the inter - action between SCAP and the ER resident Insig proteins . Bind - ing of NPC1 could , therefore , prevent movement of lipid cargo out of late endosomes . The observation that cellular cholesterol enrichment retards retroendocytic clearance of fluid - phase markers provides support for cholesterol - dependent inhibition of NPC1 function ( 6 ) . The L657F and D787N mutations may confer a gain of function phenotype by inhibiting sterol - depend - ent binding of NPC1 to the putative Insig - like protein , allowing constitutive trafficking of NPC1 with its lipid cargo . Alterna - tively , the gain of function mutations may prevent sterol - me - diated ubiquitination and degradation of NPC1 , similar to the mechanism demonstrated for the HMG - CoA reductase gain of function mutants .
