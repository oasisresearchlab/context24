Assuming that Ras activation is involved in HP - induced reactions , 20 if cellular Ras activity is increased by HP , Ras itself , Raf , Ras regulators including 21 GTPase activating proteins ( GAP ) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEF ) , then 22 the upstream receptor and / or interactions between them should have HP sensitivity . Based 23 on this hypothesis , we first attempted to examine whether Ras is activated by HP , and in 24 the affirmative , identify which factors displayed HP sensitivity using an in vitro system 25 to measure Ras activity . This in vitro system included mRaichu , a FRET - based Ras 26 activity probe , to which two - point mutations were introduced to reduce Ras - independent 27 signals . This improved Raichu was used to investigate the HP sensitivity of two 28 components , the GAP domain ( GAPd ) derived from p120GAP and the GEF domain 29 ( GEFd ) derived from hSOS - 1 . It was found that HP weakly activated Ras activity in the 30 absence of GAPd and GEFd , presumably by facilitating GDP dissociation from Ras . A 31 low concentration of GAPd enhanced HP - induced Ras activation by 16 . 3 % whereas high 32 concentrations of GAPd removed HP sensitivity , suggesting that HP partially dissociates 33 GAPd from the GAPd - Ras - GDP complex and reduces the fraction of inactive Ras . 34 Moreover , a broad concentration range of GEFd also enhanced HP - induced Ras activation . 35 Given that HP also increased Ras activity under a condition mimicking cellular Ras 36 activity , we propose that Ras activation is involved in the differentiation and growth 37 stimulation of chondrocytes by HP . 38 39 Statement of Significance 40 The Ras - cycle has been implicated in the regulation of growth and differentiation of 41 eukaryotic cells . Here , we investigated the relationship between hydrostatic pressure ( HP ) 42 and components of the Ras - cycle : Ras - Raf , the GAP domain , and the GEF domain . 43 Generally , HP tends to weaken protein - protein and protein - ligand interactions , but in this 44 study , a seemingly positive response was observed : HP - induced Ras activation . 45 Additionally , this response was enhanced by the GEF domain and the GAP domain . Thus , 46 given the multiple cellular functions of Ras and the responses of the Ras - cycle to HP , this 47 study will help clarify the molecular mechanism by which HP modulates cellular 48 functions , particularly in chondrocytes , which are subjected to repetitive HP stimuli in 49 vivo . 50 3 Introduction 51 Changes in the external environment , including hydrostatic pressure ( HP ) , induce various 52 cellular responses ( reviewed by ( 1 , 2 ) ) . Chondrocytes in joints are subjected to repetitive 53 HP stimuli , and HP induces not only cartilage deformation but also regulates chondrocyte 54 metabolic activity . Additionally , the growth of chondrocytes in culture is enhanced by 55 moderate HP stimulation ( 0 . 5 - 5 MPa ) ( 3 - 5 ) . In contrast , 25 MPa of HP , which is the higher 56 end of the physiological HP range , increases the expression of stress - related and 57 apoptosis - related genes but decreases the expression of cartilage matrix genes , leading to 58 osteoarthritis in joints ( 6 ) . Cellular HP responses are closely related to the HP sensitivity of 59 proteins themselves . Recent studies showed that HP induces structural changes in specific 60 proteins such as F1 ATPase ( 7 ) , microtubules ( 8 , 9 ) , Staphylococcal nuclease ( SNase ) ( 10 ) and 61 ubiquitin ( 11 ) . In our own attempt to characterize the HP - induced response of chondrocytes , 62 preliminary results suggested that HP stimulation ( 10 MPa ) induces the activation of 63 intracellular Ras in cultured mouse chondrocytes ( ATDC5 ) ( T . Ushida , unpublished data ) . 64 Ras is one of several small GTPases implicated in the regulation of the signal transduction 65 system for proliferation , differentiation ( reviewed by ( 12 , 13 ) ) , cell motility ( 14 ) , axon 66 formation ( 15 - 17 ) , cell adhesion ( 18 ) , and gene expression underlying those events ( reviewed 67 by ( 19 ) ) . Ras assumes two states , the " active " state when it binds GTP , and the " inactive " 68 state when it binds GDP ( reviewed by ( 13 , 20 - 23 ) ) . These two states are interchangeable , 69 forming the Ras - cycle . Active Ras binds specifically to the Ras binding domain of Raf 70 ( RafRBD ) ( 24 ) and this complex is implicated in the regulation of cell growth and 71 differentiation by modulating the expression of various genes ( 25 , 26 ) . Moreover , many 72 cancer cells are characterized by unregulated Ras activation ( reviewed by ( 27 ) ) . In the 73 cell , the transitions between active and inactive Ras are accelerated by GTPase activating 74 proteins ( GAPs ) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) ( reviewed by ( 23 , 28 ) ) . 75 These regulators adjust the ratio of active and inactive Ras and regulate Ras - related 76 phenomena and carcinogenesis ( reviewed by ( 13 , 20 - 22 , 28 ) ) . Based on the Ras - cycle 77 framework , the HP response observed in cultured mouse chondrocytes should derive from 78 HP - sensitivity of Ras itself , Ras regulators ( GAPs , GEFs ) , interactions between them , as 79 well as the interaction between Ras and RafRBD and / or the upstream growth factor 80 receptor . However , because HP generally tends to dissociate protein oligomers and 81 weakens protein - protein interactions ( reviewed by ( 29 ) ) , the upstream receptor ( receptor 82 tyrosine kinases ) that dimerizes upon activation ( reviewed by ( 30 ) ) is unlikely to confer 83 the positive HP sensitivity of Ras in chondrocytes . Regarding the HP sensitivity of Ras 84 itself , NMR spectroscopy suggested that the GTP - bound state of Ras is divided into three 85 4 sub - states : the GEF interacting state , the Raf interacting state and the GAP interacting 86 state ; moreover , as HP was increased to 20 - 150 MPa , the relative populations of the first 87 states decreased while that of the last two state increased ( 31 ) . Additionally , that NMR study 88 suggested that observed pressure - sensitive regions of Ras are closely located at the 89 interaction sites with effectors , including Raf , and regulators such as GEFs and GAPs . 90 Hence , it is hypothesized that the HP sensitivity of the Ras - cycle resides in Ras itself , Ras 91 regulators , interactions between them , and / or the interaction between Ras and RafRBD . 92 Identifying the major HP - sensitive process among these mechanisms is difficult using an 93 in vivo system , however . Therefore , we set out to develop an in vitro system to measure 94 HP - induced time - dependent changes of Ras activity using a Förster resonance energy 95 transfer ( FRET ) - based probe for active Ras , Raichu , previously constructed by 96 Mochizuki et al . ( 32 ) . Raichu is a chimeric protein consisting of four domains , YFP , H - Ras 97 ( hereafter referred to as Ras ) , RafRBD , and CFP , in this order . Raichu can assume two 98 distinct forms , open and closed , corresponding to the state of Ras , owing to the specific 99 intramolecular binding between active Ras and RafRBD . In the closed form , CFP and 100 YFP moieties come close to each other , allowing FRET to occur so that YFP fluorescence 101 is observed when CFP is excited . In contrast , when Ras is in the inactive state , Raichu 102 supposedly takes the open form , so that FRET efficiency decreases and CFP fluorescence 103 is emitted when CFP is excited . By using this probe , Ras activity was visualized in a 104 living cell using a fluorescence microscope ( 32 ) . In our experiments using a fluorescence 105 spectrophotometer , however , we noted that a certain fraction of Raichu molecules 106 spontaneously form the closed configuration , even in the presence of GDP and in the 107 absence of GTP . We reasoned that this erroneous closed configuration is due to the affinity 108 between CFP and YFP moieties since CFP and YFP are variants of GFP and because it 109 has been firmly established that GFP molecules tend to dimerize ( 33 ) . To minimize this 110 artifactual signal , we introduced point mutations equivalent to A206K ( 34 , 35 ) of GFP into 111 CFP and YFP moieties within Raichu , to yield an improved probe named mRaichu . Using 112 mRaichu , the Ras - GAP domain ( GAPd ) of p120 - GAP ( reviewed by ( 36 ) ) , the Ras - GEF 113 domain ( Cdc25 - Rem domains ) ( GEFd ) of hSOS - 1 ( 37 ) , an HP - resistant optical cell and a 114 fluorescence spectrophotometer , we established an in vitro real - time Ras activity 115 measurement system . 116 Using the established system , we detected HP - induced Ras activation , which is consistent 117 with our preliminary result that HP induces Ras activation in mouse chondrocytes . 118 Moreover , we measured Ras activity in a number of artificial and cell mimic conditions 119 under the higher end ( 20 – 30 MPa ) of the physiological HP range ( 0 - 20 MPa ) on human 120 chondrocytes in joints ( 38 - 40 ) in order to elucidate the mechanism of HP sensitivity of the 121 5 Ras - cycle . Our data indicate that Ras itself has weak HP sensitivity although the 122 interaction between Ras and GAP and GEF is mainly responsible for the sensitivity of the 123 Ras - cycle to HP . Our results are also consistent with the idea that cell behaviors that 124 depend on Ras activity , including cell growth and differentiation , are modulated by HP in 125 cells . 126 6 Materials and Methods 127 Construction of the expression plasmid and purification of mRaichu 128 mRaichu is a derivative of Raichu ( 32 ) , which has additional point mutations in YFP and 129 CFP moieties that are equivalent to A206K of GFP ( 34 , 35 ) . The mRaichu gene was 130 constructed based on a PCR - based method and fused to the 3′ end of the His - tag coding 131 sequence and the TEV recognition sequence . The His - TEV - mRaichu coding sequence 132 was amplified by PCR using the primers 133 GACGAATTCATGAATCACAAAGTGCATCAT and 134 CTCGACAAGCTTTTAGATTCTGTGCTTTTAAGC and was inserted into the Sma I site 135 of pBCKS ( Stratagene ) . The coding sequence in the resultant plasmid was subcloned into 136 the pFastBac™ Dual Expression Vector ( Thermo Fisher ) using Eco RI and Hind III sites 137 ( underlined in the primer sequences ) . The coding sequence in this recombinant donor 138 plasmid was inserted into the bacmid in Escherichia coli DH10Bac by homologous 139 recombination . Thereafter , His - TEV - mRaichu was expressed in Sf9 insect cells , referring 140 to the Bac - to - Bac ® Baculovirus Expression System user manual Version F ( Invitrogen , 141 2010 ) . 142 mRaichu was purified using a method developed for Ras purification ( 41 ) . All procedures 143 were performed at 0 - 5 °C or on ice . To stabilize the structure of Ras in mRaichu , all 144 buffers after the lysis step of this method contained 30 μM GDP and 1 mM MgCl 2 . 145 Pelleted cells , after washing with buffer ( 10 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl ) , were 146 lysed by resuspending them at 0 . 1 g cell / mL with mRaichu - Lysis buffer ( 20 mM Hepes 147 pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 7 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ( βmE ) , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 30 μM GDP , 10 148 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 5 % glycerol , 10 µM phenyl - methyl sulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) , 149 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 , 10 μM leupeptin ) and incubated for 30 min on ice . Soluble proteins 150 from lysed insect cells were obtained by centrifugation at 10 , 000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C , 151 mixed with 1 mL Ni - NTA Superflow resin ( GE - Healthcare ) that had been equilibrated 152 with mRaichu - Wash buffer 1 ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 1 M NaCl , 7 mM βmE , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 153 30 μM GDP , 25 mM imidazole , 5 % glycerol ) . The mixture was gently agitated for 1 h at 154 5 °C . After washing the Ni - NTA resin with 20 mL mRaichu - Wash buffer 1 and 10 mL 155 mRaichu - Wash buffer 2 ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 300 mM NaCl , 7 mM βmE , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 156 30 μM GDP , 25 mM imidazole , 5 % glycerol ) , the target protein was eluted with 15 mL 157 mRaichu - Elution buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 300 mM NaCl , 7 mM βmE , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 158 30 μM GDP , 300 mM imidazole , 5 % glycerol ) . The eluate was dialyzed against 1 L 159 mRaichu - Dialysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM NaCl , 7 mM βmE , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 160 30 μM GDP , 0 . 05 % NaN 3 ) , concentrated using Amicon ® Ultra Centrifugal Filters 161 7 ( Millipore ) , with a cut - off molecular weight of 100 kDa , and clarified by 162 ultracentrifugation at 80 , 000 rpm for 10 min . After calculating the protein concentration 163 from the molar absorption coefficient , which was calculated from the amino acid 164 sequence of mRaichu on PlotParam ( Expasy ) and absorption at 280 nm measured by 165 Nanodrop 2000 ( Thermo Fisher ) , the solution was supplemented with glycerol to 10 % 166 and rapidly frozen in small aliquots and stored at - 80 °C . His - TEV - mRaichu purified 167 using this method , hereafter simply called mRaichu , was used in this study without 168 removing the His - tag . 169 170 Construction of expression plasmids and purification of the Ras - GAP domain 171 ( GAPd ) and the Ras - GEF domain ( Rem - Cdc25 domains ) ( GEFd ) 172 The GAPd coding sequence derived from the p120GAP coding sequence ( RASA1 ; 173 Accession : NP _ 002881 ) and the GEFd coding sequence derived from the h - SOS1 coding 174 sequence ( SOS1 ; Accession : SPT35795 ) in the cDNA library of HeLa cells were 175 amplified by PCR . The sequences of the primers were 176 CATCATGGATCCCAGATGAGGCTGCCTA and 177 ATGATGGTCGACCTAGGTACCTGGTCTTGGGT for GAPd , and 178 CATCATGGATCCGAAAAAATCATGCCAGAAGAA and 179 ATGATGGTCGACCTACCTGACATCATTGGTTT for GEFd . The underlines show 180 Bam HI and Sal I restriction sites added for subsequent subcloning . The PCR products 181 were inserted into the Sma I site of the pBCKS plasmid , and the sequences of the PCR 182 products were confirmed . Each coding sequence in pBCKS was subcloned into pCold - 183 His - TEV ( 42 ) using Bam HI and Sal I . His - TEV - GAPd and His - TEV - GEFd were expressed 184 using each expression plasmid in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 , Takara ) . 185 His - TEV - GAPd and His - TEV - GEFd were purified as follows . All procedures were 186 performed at 0 - 5 °C or on ice . Pelleted cells , after washing with 10 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 4 ) 187 and 100 mM NaCl , were resuspended at 0 . 1 g cell / mL with lysis buffer ( 20 mM Hepes 188 pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 7 mM βmE , 10 mM imidazole , 10 µM PMSF , 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 , 189 10 μM leupeptin ) . The cells were disrupted by sonication at maximum output 25 % duty 190 cycle for 8 min with 30 % of maximum amplitude using Digital Sonifier 250DA 191 ( BRANSON ) . Soluble proteins from the sonicated cells were obtained by centrifugation 192 at 10 , 000 rpm for 30 min at 4 ℃ and His - TEV - GAPd and His - TEV - GEFd were purified 193 in a manner similar to mRaichu using 0 . 5 mL Ni - NTA Superflow resin , 20 mL wash buffer 194 1 ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 1 M NaCl , 7 mM βmE , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM imidazole ) , 10 mL 195 wash buffer 2 ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 300 mM NaCl , 7 mM βmE , 25 mM imidazole ) , 10 196 mL elution buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 300 mM NaCl , 7 mM βmE , 300 mM imidazole ) 197 8 and 500 mL dialysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM NaCl , 7 mM βmE , 0 . 05 % NaN 3 ) 198 when these proteins were harvested from a 500 mL culture . The dialyzed solutions were 199 then concentrated and clarified by ultracentrifugation at 80 , 000 rpm for 10 min . The 200 clarified solutions were further purified by gel filtration chromatography ( Superdex TM 201 200 10 / 300 GL , Cytiva ) for GEFd , or by ion exchange chromatography ( Bio - scale TM Mini 202 Macro - Prep HighQ , BIORAD ) for GAPd . The final products were stored at - 80 ℃ after 203 measuring the protein concentration as described for mRaichu above and supplementing 204 with 10 % glycerol . His - TEV - GAPd and His - TEV - GEFd purified using this method , 205 simply referred to as GAPd and GEFd , respectively , were used without cleaving off the 206 His - tag . 207 208 Measurement of mRaichu FRET 209 To verify the function of mRaichu , the fluorescence spectra of mRaichu were measured 210 in solutions containing 3 mg / mL BSA ( SIGMA , Product No . 017 - 25771 ) , 100 mM NaCl , 211 10 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 0 . 3 µM mRaichu and 212 various additives including nucleotides , GAPd , GEFd and proteinase K . The mixtures 213 were incubated for 1 h at 37 ℃ to reach a quasi - steady state and then introduced into a 214 quartz cell ( Hellma Analytics ) . Fluorescence spectra of the solution were measured using 215 a fluorescence spectrophotometer A ( FP - 8500 , Jasco ) at an excitation wavelength of 433 216 nm . Although the temperature of the samples was not regulated when single 217 measurements were made at ambient pressure , the measurements were made immediately 218 after introducing the sample at 37 ℃ into the quartz cell before the temperature dropped 219 to room temperature . 220 221 Measurement of time - dependent FRET change of mRaichu under hydrostatic pressure 222 and atmospheric pressure 223 Time - dependent changes in fluorescence spectra of mRaichu were measured by 224 fluorescence spectrophotometry with and without HP . The solution conditions were 225 identical between HP and atmospheric pressure ( AP ) measurements . The mixtures 226 containing 0 . 3 µM mRaichu and various other components were incubated for 1 h at 37 ℃ 227 to reach a quasi - steady state and then 300 µL of the solution was introduced for each 228 measurement into the inner cell of the HP - resistant optical cell ( pci - 100 , Syn Corporation ) 229 using a syringe . This inner cell was set in the outer HP - resistant optical cell . After filling 230 the space between the inner and outer cells with deaerated water using a pump ( Personal 231 Pump NP - S - 321 , Nippon Precision Science ) , this HP - resistant cell assembly was set in a 232 fluorescence spectrophotometer B ( FP - 6600 , Jasco ) . Here , HP was indirectly applied to 233 9 the solution in the inner cell through a flexible silicone portion of the inner cell ' s surface . 234 Fluorescence spectra were measured with an excitation light of 433 nm with and without 235 approximately 25 MPa HP at 37 ℃ . 236 237 Calculation of the Ras activity ratio 238 Ras activity was calculated from the emission intensities of YFP and CFP when CFP was 239 excited . Spectral measurements were made at 1 nm intervals using a 3 nm slit . Moreover , 240 to improve the S / N ratio , when the time - dependent changes of the fluorescence intensity 241 ratios were evaluated , they were calculated based on the summed fluorescence intensities 242 over the range of 470 - 480 nm for CFP and 527 - 537 nm for YFP . Then , the 10 nm - 243 averaged intensity of YFP was divided by that of CFP to yield the YFP / CFP ratio , and 244 this value was then used as the indicator of Ras activity after correction of the bleed - 245 through of CFP fluorescence in mRaichu to the YFP fluorescence window as follows . 246 First , a proportionality constant of the bleed - through of CFP fluorescence in the YFP 247 fluorescence window to the CFP fluorescence intensity in the CFP fluorescence window 248 was determined from the spectrum data shown on the homepage of Thermo Fisher 249 Scientific ( https : / / www . thermofisher . com / order / fluorescence - spectraviewer / # ! / ) . The 250 observed YFP fluorescence intensity of mRaichu was corrected by subtracting the CFP 251 fluorescence bleed - through calculated using this proportionality constant . 252 Moreover , as described in the Results , we noticed that the sensitivity of the two 253 photodetectors of the two fluorescence spectrometers used in this study had different 254 wavelength dependences , resulting in different YFP / CFP ratios , even when the same 255 samples were measured . To allow a direct comparison of data obtained using the two 256 fluorescence spectrometers , an additional correction was made as described in the 257 Supporting Information . 258 The initial YFP / CFP ratio before HP was applied in the HP experiments and that in the 259 AP experiments were sometimes unequal , even though those values should be identical 260 under identical solution conditions . These differences presumably arose due to slight 261 random variations in the incidence angles of excitation light . Therefore , the average of 262 the initial values of all the HP and AP experiments , each of which consisted of multiple 263 time - course measurements , was used as the initial YFP / CFP ratio for all the time - course 264 measurements under that solution condition . All subsequent YFP / CFP ratios in each time - 265 course measurement were translated such that the initial value of the measurement would 266 be equal to the average of all the HP and AP experiments under that solution condition . 267 This correction was made based on the assumption that the measurement - to - measurement 268 variation of the initial value of each measurement remained unchanged throughout the 269 10 measurement . Using those corrected YFP / CFP ratios , Ras activity [ % ] was calculated 270 such that Ras activity [ % ] under the GDP condition was 0 % and 100 % in the presence of 271 guanosine - 5 ' - [ ( β , γ ) - methyleno ] triphosphate ( GppCp ) . Ras activity [ % ] under AP was 272 calculated from the YFP / CFP ratio of GDP and GppCp conditions under AP , whereas Ras 273 activity [ % ] under HP was calculated from the same ratios under HP . Of note , despite the 274 A206K - equivalent point mutations introduced into the CFP and YFP moieties , small but 275 detectable fractions of mRaichu molecules were judged to spontaneously form the HP - 276 sensitive closed configuration even under the GDP condition ( Figure 3B ) , although the 277 above calculation method cancelled the contributions of the spontaneous formation of 278 closed configurations that were independent of Ras activities . To reduce the effect of 279 outliers , the difference between Ras activity [ % ] under AP and HP at 5 min after the 280 application of HP was defined as the average of the differences at 4 min and 6 min after 281 HP was applied , due to increased variation in the YFP / CFP ratio under HP . 282 11 Results 283 Functionality of purified mRaichu and interaction with GAPd and GEFd 284 An in vitro system was constructed to measure Ras activity using Raichu ( Figure 1A ) , a 285 FRET - based Ras activity probe ( 32 ) . We first attempted to prepare Raichu using E . coli . 286 However , most of the expressed Raichu passed into the insoluble fraction while refolding 287 from the solubilized Raichu pellet was also unsuccessful . Therefore , soluble Raichu was 288 prepared using an insect cell expression system ( Figure S1A ) . When fluorescence spectra 289 were observed using purified Raichu and excitation light for CFP , YFP fluorescence was 290 significantly stronger in the presence of guanosine - 5 ' - [ ( β , γ ) - methyleno ] triphosphate 291 ( GppCp ) , a non - hydrolyzable GTP analog , than in the presence of GDP , as expected 292 ( Figure S1B ) , leading us to conclude that the purified Raichu is a functional reporter of 293 Ras activity . As shown in Figure S1C , HP induced a decrease of the YFP / CFP ratio in the 294 presence of GDP or GppCp when time - dependent changes of CFP and YFP fluorescence 295 intensities of Raichu were measured , while no significant changes were detected in the 296 presence of proteinase K . The HP - induced change of the fluorescence spectrum of Raichu 297 in the presence of GDP suggested that a certain fraction of Raichu molecules 298 spontaneously formed the closed configuration in an HP - sensitive manner even when Ras 299 was in an inactive state . This HP - sensitive closed state can be caused by the affinity 300 between Ras - GDP and Raf - derived RBD moieties and / or CFP and YFP moieties within 301 Raichu . Of these two possible mechanisms , we decided to deal with the latter because it 302 is an artifact unrelated to the Ras cycle since the CFP - YFP interaction was plausible since 303 CFP and YFP are variants of GFP , and because it is well established that GFP molecules 304 tend to dimerize ( 33 ) . To minimize this artifactual signal , we took advantage of the A206K 305 mutation of GFP , which was shown to decrease the affinity between two GFP 306 molecules ( 34 , 35 ) . We introduced point mutations equivalent to A206K of GFP into CFP and 307 YFP moieties , to yield mRaichu ( Figure 1A ) . Figure 1B and C show the purification of 308 mRaichu from insect cells . A protein with the expected molecular weight was expressed 309 and approximately half of this protein was soluble ( Figure 1B ) . Thus , this soluble protein 310 was purified with Ni - resin . The purity of thus obtained mRaichu was 78 - 84 % , as 311 estimated by SDS - PAGE ( Figure 1B ) . Aggregation or oligomerization was not detected 312 in the purified mRaichu in the experimental solution containing 0 . 3 µM mRaichu and 100 313 µM GDP ( pH 7 . 4 ) following examination by gel filtration chromatography ( Figure 1C ) . 314 We next characterized this protein in terms of FRET efficiency , which reflects the fraction 315 of active Ras in mRaichu ( Figure 1D , E ) . The mixture containing mRaichu and other 316 components was brought to a quasi - static state by incubation for 1 h and then injected 317 12 into the quartz cell and measured by fluorescence spectrophotometer A . Figure 1D shows 318 the fluorescence spectra in the presence of 1 mM GDP , 1 mM GTP or 3 mM GppCp . We 319 also made measurements in the presence of a mixture of 19 . 8 µM GDP and 13 . 2 µM GTP , 320 in which the spectrum was halfway between that in the presence of 1 mM GDP and that 321 in the presence of 3 mM GppCp ( referred to as the DT condition hereafter ) . Where YFP 322 and CFP moieties were considered completely independent due to the cleavage of the 323 linker between Ras and Raf in mRaichu , effects of proteinase K were also examined in 324 the DT condition . Figure 1E shows the fluorescence intensity of YFP divided by that of 325 CFP ( YFP / CFP ratio ) , which reflects the fraction of mRaichu molecules in which the Ras 326 moiety is bound to the RafRBD moiety and hence is a quantitative indicator of the active 327 fraction of Ras . The fluorescence intensity of YFP was higher than that of CFP under the 328 GDP , GppCp , DT and GTP conditions ( i . e . , YFP / CFP ratio > 1 ) although , as expected , the 329 YFP / CFP ratios differed among the four conditions ( Figure 1D , E ) . These spectral 330 differences among the different conditions indicates that mRaichu changes its form , thus 331 reflecting the activity of Ras ( Figure 1A ) . The fluorescence spectra did not change when 332 the concentration of GDP or GppCp was further increased from 1 mM , indicating that 1 333 mM of GDP and 3 mM GppCp were saturated ( Figure S2 ) . Furthermore , in the DT + 334 proteinase K condition , the YFP / CFP ratio was lower than that of the GDP condition . This 335 result supports our conclusion that the GDP - and GppCp - dependent spectral changes of 336 mRaichu were caused by intramolecular FRET , as had been shown previously by 337 Mochizuki et al . in in vivo experiments ( 32 ) . 338 339 340 13 341 342 Figure 1 .

GDP , GppCp and GTP conditions are the 354 solutions containing 0 . 3 µM mRaichu and 1 mM GDP , 3 mM GppCp or 1 mM GTP , 355 14 respectively . The DT condition contained 0 . 3 µM mRaichu , 19 . 8 µM GDP and 13 . 2 µM 356 GTP . The DT + proteinase K condition contained 100 μg / mL proteinase K . * * : the 357 probability of no difference between Ras activities under HP and AP is lower than the 358 significance level ( t = 0 . 01 ; Welch’s t - test ) . 359 360 The Ras - GAP domain ( GAPd ) of human p120 - GAP and the Ras - GEF domain ( Cdc25 361 domain and Rem domain ) ( GEFd ) of hSOS - 1 were prepared to reconstitute the Ras - cycle . 362 These proteins were expressed in E . coli and purified with Ni - resin ( Figure S3A , B ) . 363 Figure 2 shows the effects of these proteins on mRaichu . GAPd added to mRaichu in the 364 DT condition reduced the YFP / CFP ratio in a concentration - dependent manner . This 365 result demonstrated that GAPd increased the fraction of inactive Ras , as expected ( Figure 366 2A , C ) . Conversely , GEFd added to mRaichu in the DT condition elevated the YFP / CFP 367 ratio , demonstrating that GEFd increased the fraction of active Ras , again as expected 368 ( Figure 2B , C ) . Based on these results , we concluded that the prepared GAPd and GEFd 369 were functional in terms of regulating Ras activity . 370 We next prepared various conditions to examine how Ras activity responds to HP ( Figure 371 2D , E ) . The concentrations of GDP and GTP in the cDT condition ( 0 . 3 µM mRaichu , 30 372 µM GDP , 300 µM GTP ) were based on intracellular conditions ( 43 ) . When 10 µM GAPd 373 or 1 µM GEFd was added to the cDT condition , the YFP / CFP ratio changed to levels 374 similar to the GDP and GppCp condition , respectively ( Figure 2D , E ) . Thus , in the cDT 375 conditions , + 10 µM GAPd and 1 µM GEFd were judged to be saturated . Moreover , when 376 both GAPd and GEFd were added ( cDT + 1 µM GAPd + 0 . 1 µM GEFd ) , the YFP / CFP 377 ratio reached a value between the saturation levels of GAPd and GEFd ( cDT + 1 µM 378 GAPd + 0 . 1 µM GEFd ) . Therefore , GAPd and GEFd can be used to regulate Ras activity . 379 Ras activity [ % ] , a measurement of the fraction of activated Ras under these conditions 380 ( see below for details ) , were calculated as shown in Table 1 . The fraction of active Ras in 381 normal cells was previously estimated as 20 - 40 % ( 44 ) and 30 - 70 % , depending on the cell 382 types ( 45 , 46 ) . Thus , the concentrations of GAPd and GEFd in the conditions of Table 1 were 383 selected to reproduce the cellular Ras activities in normal and cancer cells . 384 385 15 386 387 Figure 2 .

GAPd and GEFd 400 were added to the cDT condition , as indicated . * * : the probability of no difference 401 between Ras activities under HP and AP was lower than the significance level ( t = 0 . 01 ; 402 Welch’s t - test ) . 403 16 Table 1 .

This was done using a newly established in vitro measurement system 411 that included an HP - resistant optical cell consisting of inner and outer cells ( Figure 3A ) . 412 The mixture containing mRaichu and other components was brought to a quasi - static state 413 by incubation for 1 h and then introduced into the inner cell , the space between the inner 414 and outer cells was filled with deaerated water at 37 ℃ , and the assembly was installed 415 in the light path of fluorescence spectrophotometer B . HP was then indirectly applied to 416 the reaction mixture in the inner cell by pressurizing the deaerated water between the 417 inner and outer cells using a pump . Here , applied HP was 20 - 30 MPa , the higher end of 418 the physiological range of HP on human chondrocytes ( 38 - 40 ) . Additionally , the effects of 419 HP on the fluorescence properties of CFP and YFP moieties within mRaichu were tested 420 by measuring the time - dependent change of fluorescence intensities at an excitation 421 wavelength of CFP and YFP in the cDT + proteinase K condition with and without HP 422 using the in vitro measurement system , respectively . Fluorescence intensity ratios in the 423 cDT + proteinase K condition did not differ significantly over time and between the HP 424 and AP conditions , so the effect of HP on the fluorescence properties of CFP and YFP 425 moieties in mRaichu was negligible ( Figure S4 ) . 426 Changes of the YFP / CFP ratio of mRaichu were observed in the GDP , GppCp , cDT and 427 cDT + proteinase K conditions over the time course of 20 min under AP and HP ( Figure 428 3B ) . Rapid decreases of the YFP / CFP ratio were observed after HP was applied in all 429 conditions except for the proteinase K - treated samples , but the degree of decrease was 430 different among the conditions : the largest decrease was observed in the GppCp condition , 431 followed by a smaller decrease in the cDT and GDP conditions ( Figure 3B ) . Similar large 432 decreases were observed when the concentration of GppCp was changed from 3 mM to 433 2 mM or 4 mM ( Figure S5 ) , indicating that the concentration of GppCp was saturated at 434 3 mM . 435 The possibility of a systematic error in the measurement system can be excluded because 436 17 the decrease of the YFP / CFP ratio was negligibly small in the cDT + proteinase K 437 condition . Here , the range of this decrease of mRaichu was smaller than that of Raichu 438 ( Figure S6 ) , which indicated that the interaction between YFP and CFP moieties was 439 partly responsible for the large HP - induced drop of the YFP / CFP ratio of the original 440 Raichu . 441 Additionally , based on the result shown in Figure 3B , all subsequent observations were 442 terminated at 10 min after the application of HP . We estimated that consumption of GTP 443 by 0 . 3 µM mRaichu in 60 - 70 min , which includes the preincubation period and the 444 observation period , is negligibly small compared with the original concentration of 30 445 µM in the cDT condition ( for details , see Supplemental Information and Figure S7 ) . 446 Unexpectedly , the YFP / CFP ratios of mRaichu in various identical solution conditions 447 were significantly different when measured using the two fluorescence spectrometers : 448 GDP , GppCp and cDT conditions and the cDT conditions containing various 449 concentrations of GAPd and GEFd ( Figure S8A ) . Similar levels of differences were 450 observed even when the same normal quartz optical cell was used in the two fluorescence 451 spectrometers ( Figure S8A , B ) . Therefore , this difference should be due to the different 452 wavelength dependence of the sensitivity of the photodetectors in the two fluorescence 453 spectrometers . Thus , in subsequent experiments , the YFP / CFP ratios obtained using the 454 HP - resistant cell and fluorescence spectrometer B were corrected to allow a direct 455 comparison with the YFP / CFP ratios obtained using fluorescence spectrometer A in 456 Figures 1 and 2 ( for details , see Supplemental Information and Figure S8B ) . 457 Referring to the HP - induced YFP / CFP ratio decrease in Figure 3B , we introduced “Ras 458 activity [ % ] ” , which evaluates the YFP / CFP ratio under a given condition relative to that 459 in the presence of GDP and in the presence of GppCp measured using the same optical 460 cell ( i . e . , the conventional cell or the HP - resistant cell ) . More specifically , Ras activity 461 [ % ] was calculated based on the YFP / CFP ratio as a linear interpolation between the ratio 462 in the GDP condition set at 0 % Ras activity [ % ] and that of the GppCp condition set at 463 100 % Ras activity [ % ] , in order to quantitatively evaluate the fraction of active Ras when 464 the YFP / CFP ratio decreases by HP even when Ras should be fully active in the presence 465 of 3 mM GppCp . Ras activities [ % ] in three basic conditions were calculated from the 466 YFP / CFP ratios of mRaichu using the two measurement systems ( normal quartz cell in 467 fluorescence spectrophotometer A and HP - resistant cell in fluorescence 468 spectrophotometer B ) ( Figure 3C ) . As expected , there were only small statistically 469 insignificant differences between the Ras activity [ % ] values measured using the two 470 systems under all conditions ( t = 0 . 05 by Welch’s t - test ) . Hence , in the following 471 experiments , Ras activity [ % ] has been used to evaluate the fraction of active Ras in 472 18 mRaichu . Here , using the method of calculation of Ras activity [ % ] , since the correction 473 of the YFP / CFP ratio is a linear complement , the effect of the correction on Ras activity 474 [ % ] is canceled . 475 476 477 Figure 3 In vitro system to measure fluorescence spectra under HP and its method of 478 analysis . 479 ( A ) Overall configuration of the in vitro mRaichu activity measurement system under HP . 480 CTR : constant temperature reservoir . ( B ) Time - dependent changes of the YFP / CFP ratio 481 of mRaichu after application of HP ( solid lines ) and without HP application ( AP ; dotted 482 lines ) ( average of 6 measurements ) . In this graph , as well as in all the following time 483 course measurements , the values before the application of HP are shown at - 1 min and 484 the values when measurements began are shown at 0 min . The elapsed time from the onset 485 of applying HP with the pump to obtaining the measured values was approximately 1 min . 486 ( C ) Ras activity [ % ] ± SD calculated from the YFP / CFP ratios in the absence and presence 487 of GAPd and GEFd ( measured by fluorescence spectrometer A ( left white bar of each 488 group ) and fluorescence spectrometer B ( right hatched bar of each group ) ( average of 6 489 measurements each ) . The horizontal black bars and error bars indicate the average value 490 19 ± SD . Excitation was at 433 nm . 491 492 HP responsive factor ( s ) of the Ras - cycle 493 To identify the HP - responsive factor ( s ) within the Ras - cycle , we measured Ras activity 494 [ % ] under HP in non - physiological conditions and compared each value with that 495 measured under AP ( Figure 4 ) . These conditions were prepared to evaluate the HP 496 sensitivity of mRaichu itself , mRaichu + GAPd and mRaichu + GEFd , respectively . There 497 was a small but statistically significantly positive HP response of mRaichu itself ( Figure 498 4A , B ) , which is consistent with the result of a prior in silico study ( 31 ) . In the case of 499 mRaichu + GAPd , the difference showed responses depending on the GAPd 500 concentration ( Figure 4A , C , D , E ) . In the cDT condition containing a low GAPd 501 concentration ( 10 nM ) , the HP - induced increase of Ras activity was larger than that in the 502 absence of GAPd ( Figure 4A , C ) . This HP - induced increase was also observed in the cDT 503 condition containing another low GAPd concentration ( 100 nM ) . This increase was 504 equivalent to that in the absence of GAPd , whereas the addition of a high concentration 505 ( 10 µM ) of GAPd extinguished the increase ( Figure 4A , D , E ) . In contrast , in the case of 506 mRaichu + GEFd , Ras activity [ % ] consistently increased by ~ 27 % within 1 min after the 507 application of HP , and the GEFd - dependent increase was detectable even at the lowest 508 GEF concentration tested ( 10 nM ) ( Figure 4A , F , G ) . The significance of these HP - 509 induced increases was evaluated by comparing Ras activities with and without HP 510 application at 5 min after HP application ( Figure 4H and Table S1 ) . Hence , the positive 511 HP sensitivity resides in mRaichu itself and in the interaction between mRaichu and 512 GAPd and GEFd . Between those three factors , in the presence of a low concentration of 513 GAPd ( 10 nM ) , the mRaichu - GAPd interaction plays a major role ( 6 . 9 % , assuming that 514 the 16 . 3 % increase includes contributions from the two mechanisms ) in the HP response . 515 In contrast , mRaichu - GEFd interaction also had large effects on the HP response of the 516 Ras - cycle , independent of GEFd concentration ( 9 . 3 - 17 . 2 % , assuming the same 517 assumptions as for GAPd ) , equivalent to the mRaichu - GAPd interaction . 518 20 519 Figure 4 .

There were 533 significant HP - induced increases in Ras activity [ % ] under the cDT conditions 534 additionally containing GAPd and GEFd ( Figure 5A , C , D , E , F , G and Table S2 ) . 535 Importantly , these results suggested that the Ras - cycle in cells has a significant HP 536 sensitivity since positive HP responses were detected in a range of GAPd and GEF 537 concentrations . The HP - induced increase of Ras activity [ % ] was statistically significant 538 under all the conditions tested ( Figure 5H and Table S2 ) . HP - induced Ras activations 539 were observed in various conditions when both concentrations of GAPd and GEFd varied 540 ( Figure S9 ) . In particular , Ras activity [ % ] of the cDT + 10 nM GAPd + 10 nM GEFd 541 condition showed the largest HP - induced increase , as expected . 542 543 22 544 Figure 5 .

In contrast , when GAPd 561 concentration was increased to 10 µM , the HP sensitivity observed in the normal cell 562 mimic condition became insignificant or weakened ( Figure 6A , C , D , F , H , I ) . Figure 6E 563 and J and Table S3 show that , at 5 min after HP was applied , Ras activity [ % ] clearly 564 increased except when GAPd concentration was 10 µM . 565 566 Figure 6 .

As was the case with the normal cell mimic conditions , a similar HP 581 response was observed in the presence of 0 . 1 µM GAPd ( Figure 7A , B , D ) . In the case of 582 cancer cell mimic conditions , HP - induced Ras activation was significant , even in the 583 presence of 10 µM GAPd ( Figure 7A , C , D ) . Figure 7E and Table S4 show that , at 5 min 584 after HP was applied , Ras activity [ % ] clearly increased in all the conditions tested , 585 although the increase was much smaller when 10 µM GAPd was added . Hence , the 586 positive HP sensitivities of the Ras - cycle were also decreased by excessive GAP in the 587 cancer cell mimic condition . 588 25 589 Figure 7 .

The 597 horizontal black bars and error bars indicate the average value ± SD . * * : the probability 598 of no difference between Ras activities under HP and AP is lower than the significance 599 level ( t = 0 . 01 ; Welch’s t - test ) . 600 26 Discussion 601 Quantitative consideration of the YFP / CFP ratio and Ras activity [ % ] 602 We measured the YFP / CFP ratios of the fluorescence spectra of mRaichu when CFP was 603 excited at 433 nm ( Figure 1E , 2E ) . To compare the data in Figure 1E with those reported 604 in a previous in vivo study on Raichu expressed in 293T cells , the YFP / CFP ratios were 605 calculated from the fluorescence spectra of clarified cell lysate measured with the 433 nm 606 excitation light in the previous study ( 32 , 47 ) ( Table 2 ) . We conclude that YFP / CFP ratios of 607 the present in vitro study and the previous in vivo study ( 32 ) , including the effects of 608 GAPd / GAP and GEFd / GEF , are in reasonable agreement . 609 Despite the A206K - equivalent point mutations introduced into CFP and YFP moieties in 610 mRaichu , there were reproducibly significant and abrupt drops in the YFP / CFP ratio upon 611 HP application in cDT , GDP and GppCp conditions . This could be due to the combination 612 of a weak HP - sensitive interaction between inactive Ras and RafRBD and between active 613 Ras and RafRBD . Regarding the HP - induced decrease of the YFP / CFP ratio in the 614 presence of GppCp , we excluded the possibility that HP induced a dissociation of GppCp 615 from Ras because the YFP / CFP ratio did not increase when the concentration of GppCp 616 was increased from 2 mM to 4 mM ( Figure S5 ) . 617 To avoid the complexity due to this general HP - induced drop of the YFP / CFP ratios , we 618 introduced a single common index , Ras activity [ % ] . With Ras activity [ % ] , the YFP / CFP 619 ratio of each measurement was evaluated relatively with respect to the ratio of the GDP 620 condition set at 0 % activity and the GppCp condition set at 100 % in HP - and AP - 621 experiments , respectively . 622 623 Table 2 . Summary of the YFP / CFP ratio data in the previous in vivo study ( Mochizuki et 624 al . 2001 ) compared to that in this in vitro study . 625 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 The data of this study and supplemental information are drawn from Figure 1E . wt , wt + 634 GAP1m and wt + mSOS1 : the YFP / CFP ratios of the previous study were measured from 635 Source Condition YFP / CFP ratio ± SD This study cDT 1 . 25 ± 0 . 13 cDT + 10 µM GAPd 0 . 89 ± 0 . 02 cDT + 1 µM GEFd 1 . 96 ± 0 . 05 cDT + proteinase K 0 . 05 ± 0 . 00 Mochizuki et al . wt ( Raichu in 293T cells ) 1 . 6 ( 2001 ) wt + GAP1m 1 . 2 wt + mSOS1 2 . 4 wt + proteinase K 0 . 5 27 clarified lysates of 293T cells expressing Raichu or co - expressing Raichu and GAP1m or 636 mSos1 . wt + proteinase K : measured after the clarified cell lysate was treated with 637 proteinase K . 638 639 Identification of HP - sensitive elements in the Ras - cycle 640 We found that the activity ratio of mRaichu was weakly increased by HP ( Figure 4 and 641 Table S1 ) . This HP sensitivity should reside in Ras and possible mechanisms for this are 642 as follows : 1 ) HP weakens the interaction of Ras with GDP ; 2 ) HP promotes the 643 association of Ras to GTP ; 3 ) HP inhibits the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras . Among 644 these possibilities , mechanism 3 ) is unlikely since NMR analysis of Ras itself showed no 645 significant HP - induced structural changes in switch 1 and switch 2 regions ( 31 ) , implying 646 that HP has little effect on the GTPase activity of Ras . Meanwhile , mechanisms 1 ) and 2 ) 647 are qualitatively consistent with the result of in silico simulation in which the fraction of 648 active Ras increased under HP ( 31 ) . Since the ligand - protein interaction is generally 649 weakened by HP ( reviewed by ( 20 ) ) , although there are some exceptions ( 48 , 49 ) , mechanism 650 2 ) is unlikely , leaving mechanism 1 ) as the most likely scenario . 651 We next evaluated the effect of GAPd and GEFd on HP - induced Ras activation ( Figure 4 652 and Table S1 ) . HP - induced activation was much more pronounced in the presence of 10 653 nM GAPd than in its absence ( 16 . 3 ±1 . 7 % vs . 9 . 4 ±1 . 7 % ) . Additionally , since the HP 654 response increased significantly only when the GAPd concentration was low ( 10 nM ) and 655 based on the general tendency of protein complexes and protein - protein complexes to 656 disassemble in HP ( reviewed by ( 29 ) ) , we speculate that HP dissociates GAPd from the 657 GAPd - Ras - GDP complex . Further assuming that HP accelerates dissociation of GDP 658 from the resultant Ras - GDP complex , as discussed above , GTP would rapidly bind the 659 apo Ras to generate active Ras , because GTP concentration is 10 - fold higher than GDP 660 in the cDT - based conditions and apo Ras has higher affinity for GTP than for GDP 661 ( reviewed by ( 20 ) ) . This would rapidly decrease the fraction of inactive Ras and increase 662 that of active Ras . 663 In contrast , HP sensitivity of the Ras - cycle was observed in the presence of a wide range 664 of GEFd concentrations ( 1 - 1000 nM ) . The mechanistic explanation for GEFd - enhanced 665 HP sensitivity is more challenging than that in the presence of a low concentration of 666 GAPd . However , based on the general tendency mentioned above ( reviewed by ( 29 ) ) , the 667 following mechanisms may contribute to the augmentation of HP - induced Ras activation 668 by GEFd : 1 ) HP promotes the dissociation of GDP from the Ras - GDP - GEFd complex ; 2 ) 669 the intermediate state from GTP binding to the Ras - GEF complex to the GEF dissociation 670 is over - stabilized by HP . Regarding mechanism 2 ) , it is possible that , for example , Ras - 671 28 GTP changes conformationally induced by HP and could assume a structure similar to 672 that of Ras - GDP where the nucleotide is hardly exchanged because it is too stable ( 37 , 50 , 51 ) , 673 despite GEF binding , but this mechanism contradicts the general tendency . Thus , we 674 speculate that mechanism 1 ) is involved in the HP - induced Ras activation augmented by 675 GEFd . 676 This HP - induced increase of Ras activity [ % ] was also observed in the co - presence of a 677 varying combination of GAPd and GEFd concentrations , a condition mimicking cellular 678 Ras activity ( Figure 5 , 6 , 7 and Table S2 , 3 , 4 ) . To further clarify the molecular mechanism 679 of the HP sensitivity of the Ras - cycle in the physiological HP range , additional solution 680 experiments , molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations and other studies are needed . 681 682 Physiological significance of the observed HP - induced Ras activation 683 Notably , the absolute Ras activity represented by the YFP / CFP ratio was reduced by HP 684 under all the conditions tested ( Figure 3B ) , and as discussed before , this may be due to 685 the HP - induced partial dissociation of active Ras and RafRBD within mRaichu . Thus , in 686 cells , even though HP increases the fraction of active Ras , downstream signaling through 687 Raf kinase may decline , casting doubt on the physiological significance of our present 688 finding . To address this concern , we speculate that in cellular environments there are 689 additional mechanisms that stabilize the interaction between active Ras and Raf . For 690 example , RafRBD in our mRaichu consists of a well - established minimum Ras Binding 691 Domain of human Raf ( reviewed by ( 52 ) ) . However , it was subsequently shown that 692 cysteine - rich domain ( CRD ) downstream of RBD within Raf facilitates the binding of 693 Raf - RBD to active Ras ( 53 - 55 ) . Thus , inclusion of CRD to our mRaichu might stabilize 694 active the Ras - RafRBD interaction under HP . The cytoplasm is a highly crowded 695 environment and this may also stabilize the active Ras - RafRBD interaction under HP . 696 These points should be investigated experimentally in the future . 697 The relative HP - induced increase of Ras activity ( 9 . 4 ± 1 . 7 % ) could have a meaningful 698 physiological effect . Ras is involved in various cellular functions ( reviewed by 699 ( 12 , 13 , 19 , 20 ) ) including cell growth ( 24 - 26 ) . The disruption of low - maintained Ras activity 700 is a feature of cancer cells , and the relative increase of Ras activity by oncogenic 701 mutations leads cells to a cancerous state ( reviewed by ( 56 ) ) . Hence , this HP sensitivity 702 of Ras may be involved in HP - induced modulation of various cellular functions of 703 chondrocytes , and in certain cases , leads to oncogenesis . Particularly , in chondrocytes of 704 mammalian tissues , a low level of HP stimulus ( 0 . 5 - 5 MPa ) is not deleterious ( 3 - 5 ) but high 705 HP stimulus ( 25 MPa ) render them pro - osteoarthritic ( 6 ) , leading to the development of 706 cartilage osteosarcoma whose etiology is still unresolved ( reviewed by ( 57 ) ) . Furthermore , 707 29 because Ras has structural analogs such as Rho , Rap , etc . ( reviewed by ( 20 ) ) and the 708 regulators of these proteins are structural analogs of GAPd or GEFd ( reviewed by ( 28 ) ) , 709 our result suggests that these proteins may also have HP sensitivity , similar to human Ras 710 and its regulators . These possibilities can also be experimentally evaluated using a FRET - 711 based probe similar to mRaichu . Of note , similar FRET - based probes for Rap1 ( 32 ) and 712 Rho ( 47 ) have already been constructed . 713 Taking a broader view of the natural world , organisms such as deep - sea fishes are 714 constantly exposed to HP and whales that travel between the sea surface and deep sea are 715 temporarily exposed to high HP . If the observed HP sensitivity is a general feature of the 716 Ras - cycle in all vertebrates , deep sea fishes and whales might have acquired a system to 717 prevent the unwanted HP - induced Ras activation . Alternatively , if the observed HP 718 sensitivity of the human Ras - cycle is specific to organisms in which HP sensitivity has 719 physiological significance , such as humans and other large land animals , it is possible 720 that such HP sensitivity of the Ras - cycle has evolved from the non - HP - sensitive ancestral 721 Ras system . Therefore , it would be interesting to examine the Ras - cycle of representative 722 vertebrates including deep - sea fishes and whales in similar experiments . 723 30 Author Contributions 724 T .
