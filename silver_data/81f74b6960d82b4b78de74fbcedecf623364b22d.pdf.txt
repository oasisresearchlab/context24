We show here that organs can be sculpted instead by patterning anisotropic resistance within their extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . Using direct biophysical measurements of elongating Drosophila egg chambers , we document robust mechanical anisotropy in the ECM - based basement membrane ( BM ) but not in the underlying epithelium . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) on wild - type BM in vivo reveals an anterior – posterior ( A – P ) symmetric stiffness gradient , which fails to develop in elongation - defective mutants . Genetic manipulation shows that the BM is instructive for tissue elongation and the determinant is relative rather than absolute stiffness , creating differential resistance to isotropic tissue expansion . The stiffness gradient requires morphogen - like signaling to regulate BM incorporation , as well as planar - polarized organization to homogenize it circumferentially . Our results demonstrate how fine mechanical patterning in the ECM can guide cells to shape an organ . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 24958 . 001 Introduction Animal organs have a bewildering variety of distinctive forms that are critical for their functions . Although originating in a genetic program , morphogenesis of organs ultimately depends on physical forces , and specifically on their imbalances , to drive shape change ( Thompson , 1917 ) . A central question of morphogenesis is how such force imbalances are created by mechanical anisotropy that is generated within an organ’s components . Current paradigms derive from archetypes of morpho - genetic processes such as tissue elongation , and elegant studies have revealed conserved mecha - nisms that drive elongation across many species . In the Drosophila embryo , planar cell polarized ( PCP ) myosin contractility at the cell cortex generates junctional rearrangements that extend the germband , whereas in vertebrate embryos , PCP actin - based protrusions drive cell movements that extend the neural plate ( Guillot and Lecuit , 2013 ; Heisenberg and Bellaı¨che , 2013 ; Vichas and Zallen , 2011 ; Walck - Shannon and Hardin , 2014 ) . In these textbook examples of morphogenesis , as in others such as gastrulation and epiboly , the force anisotropies that instruct shape are generated within the tissue’s cells . In theory , asymmetric organs could be generated not only by spatially varying forces produced within cells , but also by spatially varying tissue properties that differentially resist uniformly applied forces . In epithelial organs , morphogenetic forces include not only tension between cells that can cause intercellular rearrangements , but also expansion of luminal contents normal to the epithelial plane ; resistance to these forces is mediated by cells and by the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , including the basement membranes ( BMs ) that line all epithelia . In comparison to the action of cellular forces , the role of non - cellular influences on morphogenesis is poorly understood . Crest et al . eLife 2017 ; 6 : e24958 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 24958 1 of 16 RESEARCH ARTICLE A comprehensive study of morphogenetic mechanics requires a tissue that is subject to both cel - lular and extracellular influences . The Drosophila egg chamber ( or ‘follicle’ ) is such a tissue ( Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) and undergoes robust elongation during its devel - opment ( Spradling , 1993 ) . Each follicle is a simple tube - like organ consisting of just two cell types , with a somatic epithelium of ‘follicle cells’ ( FCs ) encasing an interconnected cyst of germ cells . The epithelium also produces an underlying BM that surrounds the entire follicle . The organ is initially spherical and grows throughout oogenesis , expanding ~ 5000 fold in volume over ~ 3 days . Expansion for the first 35 hr is isotropic , but subsequently becomes anisotropic as the follicle elongates > 2 - fold specifically along the anterior – posterior ( A – P ) axis to form the distinctively shaped oval egg ( Figure 1A ) . Much of this elongation takes place without cell division . Genes and cell behaviors that are required for egg elongation have been identified , but the mechanical environment that actually shapes the tissue is not known ( Bilder and Haigo , 2012 ; Cetera and Horne - Badovinac , 2015 ) . Here we use biophysical tools to measure the mechanical conditions present in elongating fol - licles . Surprisingly , we find no evidence for differential cell - intrinsic forces within the organ , but instead document a robust spatial gradient in stiffness within the BM . Direct BM manipulation indi - cates that this mechanical gradient is instructive for tissue elongation . Fine mechanical patterning within the BM , generated by independent mechanisms along both the A – P and circumferential axes , endows the BM with anisotropic resistance to tissue expansion that deforms the growing tissue . These results highlight a new parameter of developmental mechanics by uncovering an unappreci - ated sophistication in BM mechanical properties that can directly impose organ shape . Results Cells in elongating follicles are mechanically isotropic To understand the conditions that drive elongation of the Drosophila follicle , we first searched for mechanical anisotropy in the organ’s two distinct cell populations . In these assays as well as others below , we examined follicles at stage 8 and earlier , when they display a regular and A – P symmetric morphology . Previous genetic mosaic experiments with several ‘round egg’ mutations exclude the germline as a site of action ( Frydman and Spradling , 2001 ; Wieschaus et al . , 1981 ; Viktorinova´ et al . , 2009 ) , while stripping of epithelium in Heteropeza results in round rather than elongated follicles ( Went and Junquera , 1981 ) . Similarly , we genetically ablated the Drosophila follicle epithelium ( as well as its underlying BM ) , and found that germline growth resulted in a nearly spherical follicle at stages when elongation would normally have initiated ( Figure 1—figure eLife digest All organs have specific shapes and architectures that are necessary for them to work properly . Many different factors are responsible for arranging the right cells into the correct positions to make an organ . These include physical forces that act within and around cells to pull them into the right shape and location . A structure called the extracellular matrix surrounds cells and provides them with support ; it can also guide cell movements . It is not clear whether the extracellular matrix plays only a passive role or a more active , instructive role in shaping organs , in part , because it is difficult to measure the physical forces within densely packed cells . The ovaries of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster provide a simple system in which to study how organs take their shape . Crest et al . developed a method to measure forces in the fly ovary as it changes from being an initially spherical group of cells to its final elongated tube shape . The results revealed that , during this process , the extracellular matrix becomes gradually stiffer from one end of the ovary to the other . This change is the main factor responsible for the cell rearrangements that shape the developing organ . This work reveals that , along with providing structural support to cells , the mechanical properties of the matrix also actively guide how organs form . In the future , these findings may aid efforts to grow organs in a laboratory and to regenerate organs in human patients .

Together , these data suggest that the germline is not an intrinsic source of mechani - cal anisotropy . To assess whether the follicle epithelium showed PCP cortical contractility , we laser - ablated cellu - lar junctions at different positions along the A – P axis and measured the recoil . In elongating Figure 1 . A mechanical stiffness gradient in the follicle basement membrane .

However , in the elongating follicle epithelium , dissection of junctions resulted in equivalent retraction of A – P and circumferentially oriented junctions ; polarized accumulation of Myo : GFP was not observed ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . These results suggest that neither follicle cell type intrinsically generates anisotropic physical forces . Patterned mechanical stiffness in the follicle BM To identify the source of mechanical anisotropy , we therefore turned to a non - cellular component of the organ : the ECM , specifically the BM . The Drosophila follicle is enclosed by a BM that , like classic vertebrate BMs , is ~ 150 nm thick and contains Collagen IV , laminin , and perlecan ( Haigo and Bilder , 2011 ; Isabella and Horne - Badovinac , 2015 ; Spradling , 1993 ) . BMs and surrounding ECM are known to have important influences on animal organogenesis ( Daley and Yamada , 2013 ; Morrissey and Sherwood , 2015 ) , but discovery of their mechanical roles has been impeded by the difficulty of measuring these directly in vivo . In the Drosophila follicle , the external position of the BM , the absence of a cellular stroma ( Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) and the ability to develop in culture provided an unprecedented opportunity to assess the mechanical properties of an intact BM , in living tissue under physiological conditions . We utilized Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) to measure BM stiffness , calculating the Young’s modulus from the deflection of a cantilevered probe indenting into the basal follicle surface ( Figure 1B , C , Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . Treatment of follicles with purified collage - nase decreased stiffness by 97 % without detectable changes to epithelial junctions , whereas disrup - tion of the cellular actomyosin network with Latrunculin A induced no significant change in the AFM measurements . Furthermore , reducing the turgor pressure of the follicle with a hypertonic solution ( 2000 mOsm sorbitol media ) does not have an effect on the BM stiffness ( Figure 1D and Figure 1— figure supplement 3 ) . These controls indicate that the quantified stiffness predominantly derives from the BM . AFM measurements at the center of staged wild - type ( WT ) follicles showed that the BM gradually stiffens as oogenesis proceeds , increasing from ~ 30 KPa at stage 3 to ~ 40 KPa at stage 5 and ~ 70 KPa at stage 7 ( Figure 1D ) . Interestingly , although stiffness was highly consistent ( > 5 % variance ) around the circumferential axis at a given position Figure 4F , it significantly varied along the A – P axis ( Figure 1E ) . At stages 3 and 5 , poles were ~ 50 % softer than the central or terminal regions ( see Figure 1D for definitions ) . This difference persisted into later stages , and the central regions further became ~ 30 % stiffer than the terminal regions . Thus , AFM analysis reveals a symmetrical gradient of BM stiffness along the A – P axis of the follicle . BM stiffness is instructive for tissue elongation If the BM stiffness gradient is functionally important for organ elongation , it should be perturbed in conditions where elongation fails . We analyzed two distinct genotypes in which follicle elongation is defective : mutants for fat2 , which encodes an atypical cadherin that controls basal PCP organization in the follicle epithelium ( Viktorinova´ et al . , 2009 ) , and RNAi - depleting mutants for misshapen ( msn ) , which encodes a kinase that negatively regulates integrin - mediated adhesion ( Lewellyn et al . , 2013 ) . We carried out AFM on staged fat2 follicles and found that , unlike WT follicles , BM stiffness did not increase from stage 5 to stage 7 ( Figure 1F ) . Strikingly , fat2 follicles showed no significant differences between the central , terminal , and polar regions at any stage . An isotropic and softer BM was also seen in msn - depleted follicles , despite their elevated integrin levels ( Lewellyn et al . , 2013 ) ( Figure 1F ) . The lack of a BM stiffness gradient in non - elongating follicles is consistent with an important role for this mechanical property in organ elongation . The data described above suggest the hypothesis that BM stiffness is in fact the anisotropic mechanical property that drives organ shape , deforming the growing tissue . An alternative hypothesis is that BM stiffness is instead an indirect consequence of organ shape , passively reflecting undetected changes in cell - intrinsic properties . To distinguish between these possibilities , we directly manipulated BM components . We then measured effects on BM mechanics and subsequent tissue elongation , including manipulations in which the A – P stiffness gradient was either eliminated Crest et al . eLife 2017 ; 6 : e24958 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 24958 4 of 16 Research article Cell Biology Developmental Biology and Stem Cells or preserved . The follicle epithelium produces most of its own BM , which can be altered by follicle - wide RNAi or by overexpression driven by tj - Gal4 ( Figure 2I ) ( Haigo and Bilder , 2011 ; Isabella and Horne - Badovinac , 2015 ; Van De Bor et al . , 2015 ) . AFM measurements on follicles depleted for SPARC , a factor involved in early BM incorporation of Collagen IV , showed that BM stiffness was ~ 80 % of WT levels in the central regions , but a gradient with increased elasticity was preserved at both terminal regions and poles ; elongation of these follicles was indistinguishable from that in WT follicles ( Figure 2A , B ) ( Isabella and Horne - Badovinac , 2015 ; Martinek et al . , 2008 ; Pastor - Pareja and Xu , 2011 ) . These follicles are distinct from those that are uniformly depleted of Collagen IV , which are homogenously soft and defective in elongation , resembling fat2 - and msn - depleted follicles ( Figure 2C – E ) ( Haigo and Bilder , 2011 ; Isabella and Horne - Badovinac , 2015 ) . By contrast , uniform overexpression of EHBP1 , which elevates Collagen IV fibril deposition , leads to ~ 15 % increased central stiffness with a ~ 20 % increased anisotropic gradient , and results in organ hyperelongation ( Figure 2F ) ( Isabella and Horne - Badovinac , 2016 ) . We then turned to spatially restricted GAL4 drivers that allow manipulation of BM components in subsets of the gradient . We depleted Collagen IV specifically in the central FCs ( using mirr - GAL4 , Figure 2J ) , where BM stiffness is normally maximal . AFM measurements showed that this manipula - tion eliminated stiffness differences between the central and terminal regions , and these follicles show significant elongation defects ( Figure 2G ) . To complement this manipulation , we overex - pressed EHBP1 locally in the terminal regions ( using fru - GAL4 , Figure 2K ) . This also equilibrated stiffness between the central and terminal regions , and again led to rounder follicles ( Figure 2H ) . * * * n . s . * * * 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 1 . 6 1 . 8 2 . 0 2 . 2 A s pe c t R a t i o ( S t . 8 ) I J tj > GFP mirr > GFP fru > GFP GFP Actin DNA K 2 . 0 1 . 8 1 . 6 1 . 4 1 . 2 1 . 0 0 . 8 1 . 5 1 . 75 2 . 0 2 . 25 Stiffness Anisotropy A s p e c t R a t i o L Round Hyperelongated Isotropic Anisotropic R 2 = 0 . 8721 E WT G Perl OE D C H F B Dome DN B M S t i ff ne ss ( k P a ) A n . s . * * * * * * WT mirr > Col IV KD tj > SPARC KD fat2 an t c en t po s t tj > Ehbp1 OE fru > Ehbp1 OE tj > Msn KD B C D E n . s . * * * * * * F * * * n . s . tj > Col IV KD G H 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 * n . s . n . s . * * * Figure 2 . Manipulating the BM stiffness gradient alters organ shape . For each follicle genotype , AFM - measured positional stiffness at stages 7 – 8 is shown above and degree of elongation is shown below . Manipulations in ( A – F ) alter gene expression uniformly via tjGAL4 ( I ) or homozygous genotype , whereas those in ( G , H ) alter gene expression regionally using centrally expressed mirGAL4 or terminally expressed fruGAL4 ( J , K ) . Compared to WT ( A ) , depletion of SPARC ( B ) softens the BM but preserves the anisotropic gradient ; follicles elongate comparably to WT . Depletion of Collagen IV ( ColIV ) throughout the epithelium ( C ) creates a uniformly soft follicle with severe elongation defects , resembling mutants in which msn is depleted ( D ) or fat2 mutants ( E ) . EHBP1 overexpression ( F ) increases stiffness while retaining an anisotropic gradient , and follicles hyperelongate . Depletion of Col IV in the central region alone ( G ) flattens the gradient while leaving terminal stiffness intact ; this results in elongation defects . EHBP1 overexpression in the terminal regions alone ( H ) also flattens the gradient and results in elongation defects .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 24958 5 of 16 Research article Cell Biology Developmental Biology and Stem Cells The data overall ( Figure 2L ) indicate that a spatially varying gradient in BM stiffness is essential for elongation , with absolute BM stiffness playing a lesser role . Importantly , direct manipulation of AFM - measured BM stiffness , associated with predictable changes to follicle morphogenesis , argues that the stiffness gradient is instructive for organ shape . Anisotropic resistance to tissue expansion by the mechanically patterned BM To functionally test whether soft or stiff and isotropic or anisotropic BMs can indeed resist tissue expansion differentially , we adapted an organ - swelling assay ( Pastor - Pareja and Xu , 2011 ) . We immersed live follicles in deionized water , creating osmotic stress that leads to water influx into the follicle ( Figure 3A , B , Video 1 ) . Acute expansion of the organ challenges the BM , resulting in burst - ing which can be monitored by live imaging . This assay measures BM rather than epithelial failure because the follicle epithelium is disrupted well before bursting and Latrunculin A treatment does not accelerate bursting ( Figure 3C , D ) . We hypothesized that the frequency and speed at which the BM bursts would reflect its overall stiffness , whereas the position at which it bursts could indicate the location of a weak point . Consistent with the former hypothesis , WT follicles at stage 8 were more resistant to bursting than those at stage 5 ( Figure 3C , D ) . All collagenase - treated follicles burst instantly . Uniformly depleting Collagen IV or SPARC also induced strong increases in bursting fre - quency , whereas depleting Collagen IV in the central FCs alone did not ( Figure 3F ) . fat2 and msn - depleted follicles showed a phenotype similar to that caused by directly weakening the BM , and burst more frequently and rapidly than WT follicles ( Figure 3C , D , F ; Videos 2 and 3 ) , whereas EHBP1 - overexpressing follicles were completely resistant to bursting ( Figure 3F ; Video 3 ) . Consis - tent with the latter hypothesis , WT follicles burst most frequently at polar regions , although bursting in collagenase - treated follicles showed no such preference , and fat2 follicles burst more frequently than WT follicles in non - polar regions ( Figure 3E ) . Other BM manipulations also resulted in bursting phenotypes consistent with the hypothesis ( Figure 3F , G ) . For instance , depletion of Collagen IV in the central FCs ( Mirr > CoIV KD ) relocalized swelling and bursting to this region ( Video 3 ) . Soft follicles generally burst more frequently and more rapidly , whereas mechanically isotropic follicles swelled more isotropically before bursting ( Figure 3F , G ) . Overall , the organ - swelling experiments support the hypothesis that the WT gradient in BM stiffness provides differential resistance to organ expan - sion that is greatest along the central meridian , and smallest at the poles where most elongation occurs . Circumferential patterning of the stiffness ‘corset’ In what elements does the stiffness gradient lie , and how is it generated ? Previous work has sug - gested that the follicle is shaped by a ‘molecular corset’ , resulting from the PCP organization of cytoskeletal elements or BM fibril - like structures ( Bilder and Haigo , 2012 ; Cetera and Horne - Bado - vinac , 2015 ; Gutzeit et al . , 1993 ; Isabella and Horne - Badovinac , 2016 ; Tucker and Meats , 1976 ) . We used the ‘tissue flattening’ image analysis tool ImSAnE ( Heemskerk and Streichan , 2015 ; Chen et al . , 2016 ) to analyze follicle BM comprehensively , including BM around the entire A – P and circumferential axes of the organ ( Figure 4A ) . In addition to PCP fibril organization , this approach revealed two unappreciated features . First , around the circumferential axis , ImSAnE quantitation showed that WT follicles display a fairly uniform distribution of Collagen IV fibrils , suggesting a regular supracellular network . By contrast , in fat2 mutant follicles , ImSAnE documented not only the loss of BM fibril polarity but also discontinu - ous and variable distribution of Collagen IV , with regions of high and low deposition ( Figure 4B – D ) . These phenotypes were shared by follicles depleted for msn . Strikingly , in both fat2 - and msn - depleted follicles , AFM measurements around the circumference at a single A - P position ( Figure 4E ) revealed a four - fold increase in the variability of stiffness when compared to the highly consistent stiffness of WT follicles ( Figure 4F ) . The data raise the possibility that uniform circumferential mechanical properties , dependent on tissue rotation , may also be required for elongation . Crest et al . eLife 2017 ; 6 : e24958 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 24958 6 of 16 Research article Cell Biology Developmental Biology and Stem Cells Morphogen - like signaling induces the organ - shaping A – P mechanical gradient Second , along the A – P axis , we noted intriguing A – P differences in BM component levels . During elongation , Collagen IV levels are increased in central regions and taper toward the poles ( Figure 5A ) . Perlecan levels , by contrast , are lower at anterior and central regions than elsewhere ( Figure 5B ) . Finally , Laminin levels are fairly uniform but are low at the anterior ( Figure 5C ) . We extended the analysis of Collagen IV , which is a major contributor to BM stiffness ( Morrissey and Sherwood , 2015 ) . Quantitation using ImSAnE documented a significant increase of Collagen IV lev - els in central regions as compared to anterior and posterior terminal regions ( Figure 5H , I ) . This pat - tern is not solely transcriptional as Collagen IV subunit gene expression is not elevated in the central region ( Van De Bor et al . , 2015 ) ( Figure 5F ) , and uniform ectopic expression of ColIagen IV Figure 3 .

We investigated how these A – P differences in BM composition are regulated . Regional variance in BM stiffness will result from a combination of transcriptional and post - transcriptional regulation ( including secretion , incorporation , and higher - order modification ) of Collagen IV along with other BM components . We asked whether any of these processes are controlled by an organizer - like activ - ity that exists at the follicle poles , in which secretion of a cytokine signal activates JAK / STAT to dis - tinguish cell fates along the A – P axis ( Xi et al . , 2003 ) . Interestingly , inhibition of JAK / STAT signaling ( via expression of a dominant negative receptor ) eliminated the differential A – P distribution of Colla - gen IV without affecting fibril polarity , and this manipulation gave rise to round follicles and eggs ( Figures 4B and 5J ) . Importantly , AFM measure - ments demonstrated that these follicles showed relatively high but isotropic BM stiffness ( Figure 5K ) . We conclude that morphogen - like signaling results in BM mechanical patterning that drives elongation . How do the various mechanical properties described above integrate to shape the organ ? ‘Molecular corset’ models derive in part from analysis of follicles mutant for fat2 , the prototyp - ical egg elongation regulator , and their mispola - rization of PCP elements such as BM fibrils ( Figure 4B ) . However , fat2 mutant follicles also fail to achieve an even distribution of BM around the follicle circumference ( Figure 4C , D ) . Addi - tionally , ImSAnE quantitation reveals that they have perturbed A – P Collagen IV pattern , although no changes in A – P signaling are seen ( Figure 5H , I , Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) . Finally , fat2 mutant follicles fail to undergo a whole - tissue rotation event associated with elon - gation ( Haigo and Bilder , 2011 ; Viktorinova´ and Dahmann , 2013 ) . To assess the role of active rotation , we depleted the actin Video 1 . WT Follicle swelling in H 2 O . Bursting of WT follicles when placed in water as shown in Figure 4B .

As quantified in Figure 4E – G , compared to WT , fat2 follicles burst rapidly and often not at the poles , whereas follicles uniformly overexpressing EHBP1 ( tj > EHBP1 ) swell anisotropically and do not burst at all . Overexpressing EHBP1 in poles ( fru > EHBP1 ) induces generally isotropic swelling but also prevents bursting . Depleting Coll IV in the central region ( mirr > Col IV KD ) cause isotropic swelling and central bursting . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 24958 . 010 Crest et al . eLife 2017 ; 6 : e24958 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 24958 8 of 16 Research article Cell Biology Developmental Biology and Stem Cells regulator Abi at stage 5 , which results in rotation arrest as elongation initiates ( Cetera et al . , 2014 ) . These follicles stiffened comparably to WT , showed bursting response comparable to WT , and also elongated normally ( Figure 5 - Fig - ure 1—figure supplement 3 , Video 4 ) . Con - versely , elongation is prevented without disrupting rotation in several genotypes ( see below , Video 4 ) , confirming that phenomena other than active rotation are required to manipulate follicle shape . Nevertheless , the altered tissue - wide distributions of Collagen IV in fat2 mutants complicate interpretations that BM fibril PCP forms the molecular corset . We were unable to identify manipulations that independently disrupted follicle PCP and the circumferentially continuous BM distribution . Therefore , to investigate the role of BM fibril polarity per se in generating elongation - driving mechanical anisotropy , we uniformly overex - pressed Perlecan , which antagonizes the constrictive properties of Collagen IV BMs and can induce round eggs ( Isabella and Horne - Badovinac , 2015 ; Pastor - Pareja and Xu , 2011 ) . This manipulation did not change the A – P levels , PCP , or circumferential distribution of Collagen IV fibrils ( Figures 4B , D and 5H , I ) . However , AFM analysis revealed that it did create a softer BM in which the anisotropic gradient has been elimi - nated , and the enclosed follicles fail to elongate ( Figure 5J , K ) . In osmotic stress experiments , fol - licles overexpressing perlecan swelled more isotropically and burst more rapidly than WT follicles ( Figure 5L ) . Thus , despite the fact that neither the levels , local PCP , or supracellular organi - zation of Collagen IV fibrils are altered in Perlecan - overexpressing follicles , the BM of these follicles had mechanical deficits similar to those of follicles completely lacking a BM . By contrast , follicles deficient for STAT - dependent A – P signaling also fail to elongate but show normal fibril polarity and organization , and are significantly more resistant to bursting ( Figures 4B and 5J – L ) . Together , these data support a requirement for a circumferentially even distribution of PCP fibrils in elongation . However , they also reveal that PCP fibrils alone are insufficient to resist tissue growth anisotropically ; the organ - shaping stiffness gradient requires patterned A – P BM levels . Discussion Organ elongation is a fundamental developmental process , and is generally considered to be driven by cell - intrinsic polarized mechanical forces that actively deform tissues . Here , we demonstrate that an elongating tissue can rely instead on mechanical anisotropy patterned into the BM . Our data indi - cate that this asymmetric resistance within the extracellular environment , rather than asymmetric force generation within the cells , plays the dominant role in molding the follicle , prescribing subse - quent morphogenetic cell behaviors . These results direct increased attention to fine BM spatial orga - nization in creating the mechanical environment that shapes each tissue , and may fill the gap between the limited repertoire of cell - based morphogenetic mechanisms and the immense diversity of organ shapes . Stromatic ECMs and BMs surround most animal organs , but their full roles in morphogenesis remain unresolved . Long regarded as an inert scaffold , ECM is known to influence tissue biology through actively regulating ligand availability and adhesion signaling ; local BM deposition and deg - radation also play key roles in the branching morphogenesis of several mammalian organs ( Daley and Yamada , 2013 ; Harunaga et al . , 2014 ; Morrissey and Sherwood , 2015 ; Pastor - Pareja and Xu , 2011 ; Varner and Nelson , 2014 ) . However , analysis of the mechanical properties of vertebrate BMs in vivo is hampered by surrounding cellular stroma , whose removal necessitates non - Video 4 .

Because of this , only exceptionally robust BMs , such as those of the eye , have been analyzed following denuding protocols ( Ali et al . , 2016 ) . By contrast , fly follicles lack a cellular stroma , and their topology allows direct access of AFM probes to the BM of an intact living tissue . Our in vivo biophysical measurements of this native BM reveal an unappreciated degree of tissue - level mechanical patterning . Within each follicle , BM stiffness develops reliably and with spatial prop - erties that are carefully regulated along both the A – P and circumferential axes . Along the A – P axis , a stiffness gradient is built that increases ~ 300 % along a ~ 13 - cell , 100 m m arc at stage 8 . Perpendicu - lar to this axis , stiffness around the circumference varies by less than 5 % across the same distance . Our data reveal that both axes are critical for organ shaping , and merit a significant revision of the ‘molecular corset’ model previously proposed to mediate elongation ( Bilder and Haigo , 2012 ; Cetera and Horne - Badovinac , 2015 ; Gutzeit et al . , 1993 ; Isabella and Horne - Badovinac , 2016 ; Tucker and Meats , 1976 ) . Hypotheses of corset structure have focused on the PCP organization of the basal actin network , the microtubule cytoskeleton , or the fibril - like BM . However , manipulations that preserve PCP alignment but nevertheless result in round follicles demonstrate that mechanical anisotropy at the length scale of individual BM fibrils is not sufficient to drive elongation . Instead , they suggest that consistent circumferential stiffness , probably associated with the supracellular BM fibrillar network generated by whole - tissue rotation , is a key element of corset effectiveness . More - over , manipulations that flatten a pole - derived A – P signaling gradient also flatten the A – P stiffness gradient , and create isotropic organs . Thus , to drive elongation , the corset must also be anisotropic on a ‘global’ tissue - wide scale , in a manner that depends on morphogen - regulated mechanical properties . The direct manipulations of BM components presented here , which lead to predicted tissue shape outcomes , argue that BM mechanics themselves are instructive for morphogenesis . Flattening the stiffness gradient in several ways , including by locally restricted BM alteration , prevents elonga - tion , whereas hyperelongating follicles have an enhanced stiffness gradient . Although we cannot rule out undetected roles of these manipulations in altering cell behaviors via classical intercellular signaling , we see no evidence for such changes in the underlying epithelium . Instead , our results Figure 4 . Uniform circumferential mechanics in elongating follicles .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 24958 11 of 16 Research article Cell Biology Developmental Biology and Stem Cells indicate that elongation is imposed by isotropic tissue growth meeting the anisotropic resistance fashioned within the BM . Consistent with this model , manipulations that alter absolute stiffness but preserve a relative gradient still result in tissue elongation . The extent to which ovarian cells respond compliantly or through well - characterized mechanical feedback mechanisms remain to be deter - mined , but the data point to physical properties of the BM as the dominant influence . Our results reveal a tissue elongation mechanism that is conceptually different from cell - intrinsic force asymmetries . Construction of mechanically patterned resistance in an ECM , along both axes orthogonal to its tissue interface , generates a force imbalance that imposes a specific shape on the growing organ , without necessitating spatially restricted localization of force generators within cells . Emerging examples point to the influence that substantial changes in exogenous physical forces can have in organ morphogenesis ( Aigouy et al . , 2010 ; Behrndt et al . , 2012 ; Etournay et al . , 2015 ; Harunaga et al . , 2014 ; rayRay et al . , 2015 ; Shyer et al . , 2013 ) as well as in tumor growth ( Kaushik et al . , 2016 ) . The discovery of precise organ - sculpting resistance within a BM motivates the development of tools and assays to explore , on a fine scale , true in vivo BM mechanical proper - ties in both physiological and pathological contexts . Materials and methods Drosophila strains The GAL4 drivers used were tjGAL4 , mirrGAL4 and fruGAL4 ( Borensztejn et al . , 2013 ) ; tubGAL80ts was used to control expression temporally by shifting flies to 29 ˚ . The Drosophila genome contains two Collagen IV subunit - encoding genes : ColIV a 1 ( Flybase : Cg25c ) and ColIV a 2 ( Flybase : vkg ) . For ease , both are referred to in the text and figures as Collagen IV ; detailed genotypes for all experi - ments are listed in Supplementary file 1 . Overexpression constructs UAS - DT - A , UAS - Perlecan ( Fly - base : Trol ) , UAS - DomeDN , and UAS - EHBP1 ( Giagtzoglou et al . , 2012 ) ; RNAi constructs against Abi , SPARC , ColIV a 1 , ColIV a 2 and msn ; and GFP protein traps in Collagen IV a 2 and perlecan were obtained from the Bloomington stock center . Fosmids carrying LanB1 – GFP ( Sarov et al . , 2016 ) were obtained from VDRC . Myo – GFP ( Flybase : sqh ) was provided by Dan Kiehart . Strains showing ectopic expression of ColIV – GFP ( UAS – GFP – ColIV a 1 + UAS – GFP – ColIV a 2 ) were provided by S . Noselli ( Van De Bor et al . , 2015 ) , and utilized hsFLP ; act > y + > GAL4 ; UAS - myrRFP , activated by a 30 min heat shock at 37 ˚ and immediately imaged with RFP signal to confirm uniform expression . fat2 KO , kindly provided by Mike Simon , is a null allele generated by ends - out gene replacement ( Maggert et al . , 2008 ) into the first exon and phenocopies other fat2 null alleles ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Imaging and analysis Ovary preparations for fixed and live imaging were performed as previously described ( Chen et al . , 2016 ) . Phalloidin - staining of fixed follicles used 20 nM phalloidin ( Sigma ) . Latrunculin A 50 m M ( Sigma ) , FM4 - 64FX 5 m g / mL ( Thermo ) , and purified Collagenase 1000 U / mL ( Worthington LS005273 ) were diluted in Schneider’s complete media ( 10 mg / mL insulin , FBS and pen / strep ) for live imaging . The measured osmolarity of the standard media was 300 mOsm . Hypertonic shrinking was per - formed in standard media supplemented with 1M D - sorbitol ( Sigma ) to 2000 mOsm . Fixed follicles were mounted with tape spacers , except for flattened preparations ( which lacked spacers ) and ImSAnE preparations ( which were mounted in a depression slide ) . Single - plane confocal images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM700 using a Plan Apochromat 20x / NA 0 . 8 lens or a LD C - Apochromat 40x / NA 1 . 1 water - immersion lens and processed in Fiji software ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . Represen - tative images were isolated and assembled into figures using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator CS6 . For cortical MyoII planar polarity quantification ( Munjal et al . , 2015 ) , IMSAnE ( Heemskerk and Streichan , 2015 ) was used to ‘unroll’ the follicle epithelia as previously described by Chen et al . , ( 2016 ) but with modifications . Apical surfaces of interest ( SOI ) of the epithelia were identified by Sqh - GFP signal . Multilayered cylinder projections of the apical - lateral membranes from the apical - most SOI plus minus 2 – 2 . 5 m m were generated by IMSAnE class CylinderMeshWrapper . Maximum intensity projections were background subtracted with the Fiji plugin ‘subtract background’ . A – P and circumferential junctions were categorized by 60 – 90 ˚ and 0 – 30 ˚ degrees , respectively , relative Crest et al . eLife 2017 ; 6 : e24958 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 24958 12 of 16 Research article Cell Biology Developmental Biology and Stem Cells to the A – P axis . Cortical Sqh – GFP was selected manually with line tools ( width 8px ) on > 30 junctions of each type ; the mean ratio was plotted . For ColIV – GFP intensity measurements , in toto images were collected with pixel width of 0 . 17 m m and voxel depth of 0 . 50 m m without Z - intensity correction . Follicle SOI was identified using basal F - actin signal and generalized sinusoidal projections were generated by the IMSAnE class spherelike - Fitter . Maximum intensity projections from multilayered pullbacks ± 3 m m from the basal epithelia were generated . To measure A – P intensity , five 1 - pixel - wide lines were drawn within a 10 m m wide stripe at the central meridian , where the pullbacks have minimal distortion . To measure circumferen - tial intensity , five circumferential 1 - pixel - wide lines were drawn within a 10 m m wide stripe along the circumferential meridian . Intensities were standardized to follicle length , then compared across fol - licles . Variance was calculated for each follicle using the Excel var . p formula . Profile plots were gen - erated in Fiji software . Laser ablation Ecad – GFP follicles were dissected in medium and placed in a glass - bottomed dish . A pulsed Mai - Tai two - photon on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope was used to sever A – P or circumferential junc - tions at anterior , central , and posterior positions on the follicle . At 708 nm and 90 % power , the abla - tion time was less than 1 s and the resulting junction relaxation distances were measured within 300 ms . Analysis was executed manually in Fiji software normalizing the relaxed distance to the original junction length . Similar results were obtained using a UV Micropoint laser at 50 % power and a Nikon Ti - E inverted microscope with a Yokogawa X1 confocal spinning disk head , with images continuously collected ( 500 ms / frame ) . Atomic force microscopy BM stiffness was measured ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) using either a Bruker Catalyst AFM controlled by Nanoscope 8 . 10 software or a custom - built AFM controlled by LAbview software , both mounted on an inverted Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 microscope . MLCT - C cantilevers ( Bruker ) with a pyra - midal tip and a nominal spring constant of 10 pN / nm were used in all experiments . The actual spring constant of each cantilever was determined by thermal calibration in air . Measurements were done in fluid . Approach velocity was optimized as 0 . 4 m m / sec to ensure the fastest rate of elastic measure - ment without viscoelastic deformation . Sample rate of deflection was 2048 . Retraction speed , which does not affect elasticity measurements , was set to 20 m m / sec . Follicles were prepared as for live imaging ; the cantilever was positioned at the desired position by brightfield microscopy . Each posi - tional measurement was taken four times without moving the cantilever in XY and averaged . Young’s Modulus of elasticity was calculated by fitting the cantilever deflection versus piezo extension curves to the modified Hertz model as described ( Rosenbluth et al . , 2006 ) , using a custom - written algo - rithm in MATLAB ( Mathworks ) . Only the first 50 nm of indentation were used to isolate elasticity from just the basement membrane ( BM ) . For pole measurements , PDMS egg holders were created using custom - made molds , coated first with poly - D lysine and then treated with complete growth media . Follicles were gently mounted in PBS which was subsequently replaced with media . Osmotic swelling Follicles dissected in complete media were adhered to a poly - D lysine glass - bottomed dish ( MatTek ) before replacing the medium twice with dH 2 0 . Images were collected at 15 s or 30 s intervals on a Zeiss Axioimager with a Plan - Neofluor 10x / 0 . 38NA objective . Statistical analysis Data were analyzed and displayed using Microsoft Excel . All error bars represent standard errors and centers represent means . At least three biological replicates were undertaken for each experi - ment and the results are given in Supplementary file 1 . All acquired data were included with the exception of the AFM experiments . For these , only follicles in which all three lateral positions could be quantified were used . Statistical analysis for all data used two - tailed t - tests with p - value thresh - olds of * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , and * * * p < 0 . 001 . Crest et al . eLife 2017 ; 6 : e24958 .
