Korn , National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute , Bethesda , MD , and approved August 26 , 2015 ( received for review July 15 , 2015 ) Multiple protein subcomplexes of the kinetochore cooperate as a cohesive molecular unit that forms load - bearing microtubule attach - ments that drive mitotic chromosome movements . There is intriguing evidence suggesting that central kinetochore components influence kinetochore – microtubule attachment , but the mechanism remains unclear . Here , we find that the conserved Mis12 / MIND ( Mtw1 , Nsl1 , Nnf1 , Dsn1 ) and Ndc80 ( Ndc80 , Nuf2 , Spc24 , Spc25 ) com - plexes are connected by an extensive network of contacts , each essential for viability in cells , and collectively able to withstand sub - stantial tensile load . Using a single - molecule approach , we demon - strate that an individual MIND complex enhances the microtubule - binding affinity of a single Ndc80 complex by fourfold . MIND itself does not bind microtubules . Instead , MIND binds Ndc80 complex far from the microtubule - binding domain and confers increased micro - tubule interaction of the complex . In addition , MIND activation is redundant with the effects of a mutation in Ndc80 that might alter its ability to adopt a folded conformation . Together , our results suggest a previously unidentified mechanism for regulating micro - tubule binding of an outer kinetochore component by a central kinetochore complex . kinetochore | Ndc80 complex | MIND / Mis12 complex | mitosis | microtubules D uring mitosis , kinetochores coordinate the movement of replicated chromosomes into two daughter cells and ensure that the genome is equally segregated upon division . Kineto - chores maintain a grip on dynamic microtubules that are con - stantly growing and shortening , and they also ensure that each chromatid is properly attached to microtubules emanating from only one pole . These attachments must be strong enough to withstand the mechanical tension associated with bipolar chro - mosome alignment , and yet they must be quickly released in response to signals that detect improper attachments ( 1 , 2 ) . Each kinetochore is a macromolecular structure composed of 40 dif - ferent types of proteins assembled into repeating subcomplexes that span from the centromeric DNA to the microtubule ( 2 ) . There is an intrinsic hierarchy , with few DNA - binding elements expanding out to multiple microtubule attachment complexes ( 3 , 4 ) . How subcomplexes are held together and function as a co - hesive molecular unit is unclear . Assembling kinetochore pro - teins in vitro allows us to map their interconnectivity and directly probe how each component contributes to microtubule attach - ment strength . By systematically rebuilding a kinetochore in vitro , we aim to gain a clear understanding of force transmission throughout the kinetochore and to discern the precise role of each component in kinetochore function . Previous work has characterized the individual and combined activities of the outer microtubule - binding kinetochore com - plexes ( 1 , 2 ) . How central kinetochore complexes contribute to establishing and maintaining microtubule attachment is less clear . Work from Caenorhabditis elegans identified a conserved core microtubule - binding “ KMN ” network composed of Knl1 / Spc105 , Mis12 / MIND ( Mtw1 , Nsl1 , Nnf1 , Dsn1 ) complex , and Ndc80 ( Ndc80 , Nuf2 , Spc24 , Spc25 ) complex ( 5 ) . In C . elegans , the 4 - protein Ndc80 complex and Knl1 bind directly to micro - tubules , but MIND does not . Instead , MIND serves as a struc - tural linker that connects DNA - binding components with the microtubule - binding complexes ( 6 , 7 ) . The KMN complex binds microtubules with a higher affinity than Ndc80 complex or Knl1 alone , demonstrating that MIND can facilitate the synergistic binding of outer kinetochore complexes . This finding highlighted the importance of cooperation between kinetochore complexes and suggested that central complexes can enhance kinetochore – microtubule attachment indirectly by acting through the microtu - bule - binding components . However , the mechanisms underlying this enhancement remain unknown . Two hypotheses can explain how a central kinetochore com - plex could increase the microtubule binding activity of an outer kinetochore component . One possibility is that it oligomerizes the outer kinetochore component to increase avidity . Another possibility is that the central kinetochore component induces structural changes in the outer component that enhance its Significance During cell division , multisubunit kinetochores partition chro - mosomes while maintaining a grip on dynamic microtubules under tension . Previous work in Caenorhabditis elegans showed that the central kinetochore component , Mis12 / MIND ( Mtw1 , Nsl1 , Nnf1 , Dsn1 ) complex , increases microtubule binding of outer kinetochore complexes , but the mechanism for this en - hancement remains unknown . Here , we identify new contacts between MIND and the outer kinetochore Ndc80 ( Ndc80 , Nuf2 , Spc24 , Spc25 ) complex that are essential for interaction in vitro and for cell viability . Using single - molecule microscopy , we demonstrate that a single MIND complex enhances the micro - tubule binding of a single Ndc80 complex . Our results suggest a molecular mechanism for enhancing kinetochore – microtubule attachment by a central kinetochore component . Author contributions : E . M . K . , N . T . U . , and T . N .

Although MIND has been shown to enhance the microtubule binding of Knl1 in cosedimentation assays ( 5 ) , this method cannot distinguish which mechanism is responsible . Whether MIND can similarly affect the Ndc80 complex ( Ndc80c ) by either mechanism has not been tested . Within the kinetochore , outer components are present in higher copy numbers relative to central components , suggesting that oligomerization may be a mechanism to enhance microtubule binding . Additionally , substantial evidence suggests that the outer kinetochore Ndc80 complex undergoes conformational changes throughout mitosis ( 8 – 10 ) . The Ndc80 complex hinges about a flexible “ loop ” region and exists in both a folded con - formation and an elongated state ( 8 , 11 ) . In vivo evidence supports the physiological significance of these conformational changes ( 10 , 12 ) , underscoring the importance of different conformations of the Ndc80 complex . However , it is unknown whether these struc - tural changes correlate with changes in microtubule affinity . The Ndc80 complex also interacts with a second kinetochore re - ceptor , CENP - T / Cnn1 ( 13 – 16 ) . It is unclear how central kinet - ochore components influence the activity of the Ndc80 complex throughout mitosis . Here , we have reconstituted the MIND – Ndc80 ( MN ) co - com - plex using recombinant yeast components and have used cross - linking analysis to identify a network of interactions between the two complexes that is more extensive than previously recognized . Using single - molecule fluorescence microscopy , we found that MIND enhances the microtubule - binding activity of the Ndc80 complex . This enhancement does not require oligomerization of the Ndc80 complex . Instead , a single MIND complex binds a single Ndc80 complex far from its microtubule - binding domain and confers increased microtubule interaction of the co - complex . In addition , MIND activation is redundant with the effects of a mutation in Ndc80 that hinders its ability to adopt a folded con - formation , suggesting that MIND might promote an unfolded conformation of Ndc80 complex with higher affinity for microtu - bules . Finally , we used optical tweezers to show that the MIND – Ndc80 linkage can support the high levels of tension generated by the components of the kinetochore – microtubule interface , estab - lishing the MIND complex as a key component of the force transmission pathway within the kinetochore . Results The MIND and Ndc80 Complexes Are Connected by an Extensive Interaction Network . To study the interaction between the MIND and Ndc80 complexes in vitro , we assembled a stable MIND – Ndc80 ( MN ) co - complex with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry ( 17 , 18 ) ( Fig . 1 A and Fig . S1 ) . By pairing gel filtration and velocity sedimentation experiments , we found that MN exhibits a frictional ratio of 2 . 7 ( 19 ) , consistent with its extremely elongated conformation as seen previously by negative - stain electron microscopy ( 17 , 18 , 20 ) ( Fig . S1 ) . We generated a comprehensive map of interactions between the two complexes by treating MN with the cross - linking agent disuccinimidyl suberate and identifying the cross - linked peptides by mass spectrometry ( 10 ) ( Fig . 1 B and Tables S1 – S3 ) . The C - terminal regions of Mtw1 , Nsl1 , and Dsn1 interface with two highly conserved amphipathic helices of Spc24 ( Fig . 1 B and C ) . Specifically , Nsl1 seems to bind a hydrophobic pocket between the α 2 - helices of Spc24 and Spc25 , previously recognized as a putative interaction site ( 21 ) ( orange circles , Fig . 1C ) , but for which no binding partner had been identified . Mtw1 binds the α 1 - helix on the opposite side of Spc24 , in the same region shown to interact with another Ndc80c receptor , CENP - T / Cnn1 ( yellow circle , Fig . 1 D ) ( 22 ) . Because Spc25 contains only three lysines ( Fig . 1 B ) , our lysine - specific cross - linker provided limited infor - mation about MIND – Spc25 interactions . Previous work identified the C - terminal region of Dsn1 as being important for interaction with Spc24 and Spc25 and suggested that it also shares the binding site with Cnn1 ( 20 , 22 ) . Our cross - linking results support this in - teraction although we detected far fewer cross - links between Dsn1 and Spc24 than between Nsl1 or Mtw1 and Spc24 . Small regions of Nsl1 , Mtw1 , and Dsn1 also cross - linked to disordered segments of Spc24 ( 138 – 154 ) and Spc25 ( 128 – 132 ) not depicted in the crystal structure ( Fig . 1 C ) ( 21 ) . Our cross - linking analysis dem - onstrates that , whereas MIND and Cnn1 share an overlapping binding site within the Ndc80 complex , MIND also forms a second distinct connection to Ndc80c . Using our cross - links as a guide , we generated three sets of mutations within Dsn1 , Nsl1 , and Mtw1 to determine whether these regions are required to form the MN co - complex ( Fig . 2 A ) . Lysines K198 , K205 , and K207 of Nsl1 lie within a predicted amphipathic helix and displayed multiple cross - links to the Spc24 pocket . Therefore , we mutated hydrophobic residues V199 , Y201 , V203 , and V206 to aspartic acid to disrupt the hydro - phobic side of the putative Nsl1 amphipathic helix ( nsl1 - 4D ) . Second , we truncated the 62 C - terminal residues of Mtw1 ( mtw1 - 220 ) , from which multiple cross - links to Spc24 were identified . Third , we analyzed the effects of the L562D / L563D mutation in Dsn1 ( dsn1 - 2LD ) that was previously suggested to disrupt the interaction between the MIND and Ndc80 complexes in vivo ( 22 ) . None of these mutations interfered with the assembly of the MIND complex , as indicated by the normal migration of all three mutant complexes in size - exclusion chromatography experiments ( Fig . S2 ) . The ability of mutant MIND complexes to bind the Ndc80 complex was quantified in vitro by immunoprecipitation ( Fig . 2 A ) .

MIND complex were impaired in coimmunoprecipitation with the Ndc80 complex ( Fig . 2 B , Right ) . dsn1 - 2LD was previously shown to cause lethality ( 22 ) , and we tested whether nsl1 - 4D or mtw1 - 220 was also detrimental to cell growth . We deleted the endogenous copy of NSL1 or MTW1 and asked whether a mu - tated allele ( nsl1 - 4D or mtw1 - 220 ) could support growth . Cells containing only nsl1 - 4D or mtw1 - 220 alleles failed to grow whereas those also containing WT copies of NSL1 or MTW1 grew normally ( Fig . 2 C ) . Thus , the Mtw1 C terminus and an amphipathic helix in Nsl1 are essential for the formation of the MN co - complex . Together , these results reveal an extensive protein interaction network , centered on a conserved binding pocket on the Spc24 - Spc25 heterodimer , that connects the MIND and Ndc80 complexes . MIND Activates Microtubule Binding by Ndc80c via a Mechanism Distinct from Dam1c Activation . We next used the MIND - GFP / Ndc80 co - complex to determine whether MIND influences the microtubule - binding properties of the Ndc80 complex . The KMN network binds synergistically to microtubules , and MIND can directly affect the activity of Knl1 in vitro ( 5 ) . It is unknown whether MIND can similarly influence the behavior of the Ndc80 complex . In nematodes , the MIND and Ndc80 complexes do not directly interact without Knl1 , but they do form a stable co - complex in many other organisms , including yeast and humans ( 17 , 18 , 20 ) . We therefore assessed how the MIND complex influences Ndc80 complex microtubule binding at the single - molecule level using total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy . As shown previously , Ndc80c - GFP alone has a relatively weak affinity for microtubules ( 23 ) and exhibited a mean resi - dence time of 2 . 5 ± 0 . 1 s on the microtubule lattice ( Fig . 3 A and B ) . Previous work found that addition of the 10 - member outer kinetochore Dam1 complex increased the residence time of Ndc80c 2 . 6 - fold , to 6 . 4 ± 0 . 2 s ( Fig . 3 A and B ) ( 24 ) . Surprisingly , we found that MIND also dramatically affected the microtubule binding of Ndc80c because the residence time of MIND - GFP / Ndc80c complexes was 10 . 4 ± 0 . 6 s , fourfold longer than that of Ndc80c - GFP ( Fig . 3 B ) . By contrast , MIND - GFP alone did not interact with microtubules ( 5 ) , even when added at high concentrations ( Fig . S3 ) , indicating that MIND activates the microtubule - binding activity of the Ndc80 complex . The effects of MIND and Dam1c on the ability of Ndc80c to bind microtubules are additive . The average residence time for MIND - GFP / Ndc80c increases 1 . 5 - fold in the presence of Dam1 complex to 16 . 5 ± 0 . 7 s ( Figs . 3 A and B ) .

Kudalkar et al . PNAS | Published online October 1 , 2015 | E5585 B I O C H E M I S T RY P N A S P L U S effect suggests that Dam1c and MIND influence Ndc80c via independent mechanisms . The observation that MIND and Dam1c influence Ndc80c independently was further supported by their disparate effects on the motility of Ndc80c along microtubules . MIND showed a milder effect on the diffusion of Ndc80c than does the Dam1 complex ( Fig . S4 ) . We also found that MIND and Dam1c differ in their ability to enhance the tracking of Ndc80c with dis - assembling microtubule tips . Dynamic microtubule extensions were assembled off of GMPCPP - stabilized microtubule seeds , and their disassembly was initiated by the removal of free tubulin from solution . Ndc80c - GFP alone tracks poorly with disassem - bling microtubule ends but can track robustly when artifi - cially oligomerized by antibodies , or in the presence of Dam1c ( 23 , 24 ) ( Fig . S5 ) . By contrast , MIND did not enhance the ability of Ndc80c to track disassembling microtubule ends ( Fig . S5 ) . Therefore , Dam1c and MIND have different effects on the mi - crotubule binding , diffusion , and tip tracking of Ndc80c . These observations indicate that MIND and Dam1c do not simply in - fluence the behavior of Ndc80c by differing degrees , but do so by distinct mechanisms . The MIND – Ndc80c Interface Can Bear Substantial Levels of Mechanical Load . In vivo , kinetochores transmit tension from the microtubule interface to the centromeric DNA . Beyond the Ndc80 and Dam1 complexes ( 24 ) , it is not known which kinetochore components participate in the force transmission pathway . We therefore asked whether MIND could directly support mechanical load trans - mitted through Ndc80c . Indeed , when bound to polystyrene beads via a His tag on MIND , MIND - His / Ndc80c - FLAG was able to couple beads to both assembling and disassembling microtubule tips against an applied load of ∼ 2 . 5 pN ( Fig . 4 A ) . Beads failed to couple to microtubules against force when decorated with the MIND – His complex in the absence of Ndc80c - FLAG ( n = 30 ) . Likewise , no coupling was observed when beads lacking MIND – His were incubated with Ndc80c - FLAG alone ( GFP - His – coated beads , n = 79 and uncoated beads , n = 60 ) ( Fig . S6 ) . These controls rule out direct microtubule binding by MIND and / or nonspecific adsorption of Ndc80 - Flag to the beads . Therefore , the applied load must be transmitted through the MIND – Ndc80c in - terface . To probe the strength of the MIND – Ndc80 linkage , we used a rupture force assay ( 25 ) . MIND - His / Ndc80c - FLAG – coated beads were coupled to assembling microtubule tips and briefly subjected to a test force of ∼ 1 pN . Then , the load was increased at a constant rate ( 0 . 25 pN · s − 1 ) until the bead detached from the mi - crotubule . On average , MIND - His / Ndc80c - FLAG – mediated at - tachments ruptured at 3 . 8 ± 0 . 2 pN , comparable with the strength afforded by coupling Ndc80 complex directly to the bead , 4 . 5 ± 0 . 2 pN ( not significantly different , P = 0 . 26 ) ( Fig . 4 B ) . When Dam1c - FLAG was added to the assay , the average rupture force of MIND - His / Ndc80c - FLAG beads increased to 9 . 0 ± 0 . 6 pN ( Fig . 4 B ) . Altogether , these results indicate that the linkage between MIND and Ndc80c can support substantial levels of tension , suggesting that MIND complex is a key participant in force transmission through the kinetochore . A Single MIND Activates a Single Ndc80 Complex . The Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes form a unit on microtubules that increases the number of microtubule - binding contacts . Unlike Dam1c , MIND does not form additional direct contacts with the microtubule but instead contributes to microtubule binding indirectly through Ndc80c . How might MIND activate microtubule binding by Ndc80c ? One possible explanation is that MIND promotes oligomerization of Ndc80c on microtubules , thereby increasing avidity . MIND could drive oligomerization of Ndc80c by binding two or more Ndc80 complexes and / or by binding other MIND complexes . First , we tested for oligomerization directly by performing a dual - label TIRF experiment to compare the residence time of GFP - tagged Ndc80 complexes alone to those that colocalized with MIND - SNAP ( Fig . S7 A – C ) . By measuring fluorescence intensity , we found that Ndc80c - GFP remained monomeric when alone or bound to MIND - SNAP , but its residence time was significantly increased when in complex with MIND ( Fig . S7 B and C ) . Second , we added excess Ndc80c in our TIRF assay in an attempt to both drive the association of MIND with multiple Ndc80c complexes and maximize the occupancy of Ndc80 - binding sites within the MIND complex . Supplementing up to a 267 - fold molar excess of Ndc80c did not affect the residence time of MN on microtubules ( Fig . S7 D ) . Third , under assay conditions where MIND enhanced microtubule binding by Ndc80c , MIND oligomerization was rare ; the average fluores - cence intensity of GFP - tagged MIND within MN co - complexes bound to microtubules was similar to that of monomeric GFP - tagged Ndc80 complexes ( Fig . 3 C ) . Altogether , these data dem - onstrate that , in our assay , MIND does not enhance Ndc80c mi - crotubule binding by oligomerization . Instead , a single MIND complex directly enhances microtubule attachment by a single Ndc80 complex . We hypothesized that MIND induces a conformational change in the Ndc80 complex that favors microtubule coupling by acti - vation of the microtubule - binding domains . The Ndc80 complex binds microtubules primarily through the Ndc80 calponin ho - mology ( CH ) domains and the Ndc80 N - terminal tail ( Fig . 5 A ) ( 26 – 29 ) . We first tested whether MIND activation requires the N - terminal tail of Ndc80 . In our cross - linking analysis , the dis - ordered Ndc80 N - terminal tail interacted with portions of Ndc80 , Nuf2 , Spc24 , and Spc25 ( Fig . S8 A ) ( 10 ) . The presence of the MIND complex reduced cross - linking of the tail , potentially restricting its position in the complex ( Fig . S8 B and Tables S1 – S3 ) . As previously demonstrated ( 28 , 29 ) , tail - less Ndc80 com - plex ( Δ tail - Ndc80c - GFP ) bound poorly to microtubules . Due to its extremely short interactions with microtubules at the single - molecule level , we were unable to accurately measure its resi - dence time in the TIRF assay . However , MIND increased the residence time of Δ tail - Ndc80c , yielding an average of 5 . 2 ± 0 . 7 s , indicating that the tail domain is not required for MIND - mediated enhancement ( Fig .

We recently identified a temperature - sensitive mutant of Ndc80 ( ndc80 - 121 ) ( 10 ) that harbors two mutations near the loop domain , far from the microtubule and MIND - binding domains ( Fig . 5 A ) .

Consistent with this view , the Ndc80 - 121 – GFP complex bound at the restrictive temperature ( 37 °C ) to microtubules 1 . 5 - fold longer than the WT complex ( Fig . 5 B ) . We then asked whether MIND can further enhance the ability of the Ndc80 - 121 complex to bind microtubules by measuring the residence time of a MIND - GFP / Ndc80 - 121 co - complex via TIRF . MIND - GFP / Ndc80 - 121c assembled as a stoichiometric complex and exhibited a similar gel filtration profile as MIND - GFP / Ndc80c , indicating that the ndc80 - 121 mutations did not affect interaction with MIND ( Fig . S9 ) . At 37 °C , MIND - GFP / Ndc80c also exhibited an av - erage residence time 1 . 5 - fold longer than Ndc80c - GFP alone , similar to the behavior of Ndc80 - 121 – GFP ( Fig . 5 B ) . By contrast , MIND did not further enhance the binding of Ndc80 - 121c ; MIND - GFP / Ndc80 - 121c residence time was indistinguishable from Ndc80 - 121 complex alone ( not significantly different , P = 0 . 58 ) ( Fig . 5 B ) . These results suggest that both MIND and the ndc80 - 121 mutations alter the behavior of the Ndc80 complex by the same mechanism , which may involve promoting conforma - tional activation of the Ndc80 complex . Discussion MIND was previously identified as part of the core microtubule - binding KMN network , yet how MIND facilitates microtubule attachment has remained unclear . By reconstituting the yeast MIND / Ndc80 co - complex and using cross - linking analysis , we have identified an intricate set of interactions involving five of the eight proteins within the two complexes . In addition to the previously identified Spc24 – Spc25 interface shared by both MIND and Cnn1 ( 15 , 22 ) , we found a unique connection be - tween Nsl1 and a hydrophobic Spc24 / Spc25 cleft . This identifi - cation of a second unique interface suggests that the Ndc80 complex may differentially interact with MIND and Cnn1 , raising the possibility that each receptor might distinctly regulate Ndc80c function . Furthermore , Nsl1 has been identified as a link between human Mis12 and Ndc80 complexes ( 20 ) , and our identification of its important contribution to the yeast MIND / Ndc80 interface establishes the structural conservation of this connection . Using single - molecule techniques , we show that the MIND complex promotes the binding of Ndc80c to microtubules . This effect is additive , with the enhancement conferred by the Dam1 complex , providing further evidence that kinetochore compo - nents act cooperatively to form robust microtubule attachments . Finally , we demonstrate that the MIND / Ndc80c interface can withstand substantial load , implicating MIND as an integral component of the force transmission pathway of the kinetochore . How does MIND enhance microtubule attachments ? MIND binds Ndc80c far from its microtubule - binding domain ( 17 , 18 , 20 ) . Consistent with this placement , we show here that MIND does not directly bind microtubules . Furthermore , MIND does not seem to enhance binding by organizing the Ndc80 N - terminal tail domain nor is oligomerization of Ndc80c required . Instead , we demonstrate that an individual MIND complex enhances the microtubule binding of a single Ndc80 complex . We show that MIND binding to the Spc24 / Spc25 terminus of the Ndc80 complex confers increased affinity of the microtubule - binding domain . The Ndc80 complex hinges about a flexible loop region , and in vitro and in vivo evidence supports the existence of both a folded conformation and an elongated state ( 8 , 11 ) . Here , we show that a temperature - sensitive NDC80 mutant ( ndc80 - 121 ) that has been previously suggested to affect the stability of a folded complex at 37 °C exhibits increased microtubule affinity at 37 °C compared with the WT complex . Because addition of MIND does not further increase the affinity of the Ndc80 - 121 complex for microtubules , MIND and Ndc80 - 121c increase affinity by a redundant mechanism . We propose that both favor formation of an open , high - affinity conformation of the Ndc80 complex . The physiological relevance of different conformational states of the Ndc80 complex has remained unclear . Deleting the loop domain of Ndc80 causes lethality , suggesting that flexibility of the complex is necessary in vivo ( 12 ) . Additional in vivo evidence suggests that a folded Ndc80 complex is important during early mitosis whereas an elongated conformation exists at metaphase ( 8 – 10 ) . We propose that the Ndc80 complex adopts different conformations to modulate the strength of its microtubule at - tachment . A folded Ndc80 complex that interacts less stably with microtubules might be favorable in prometaphase when erro - neous attachments must be corrected by Ipl1 / Aurora B kinase ( 30 , 31 ) . The Ndc80 complex adopts an elongated conformation during metaphase , which could promote strong microtubule in - teraction when kinetochore tension is highest . Folding of the complex at the Ndc80 loop domain positions Spc24 and Spc25 near the microtubule - binding domains of Ndc80 , potentially obstructing full contact with microtubules . Indeed , it was pre - viously demonstrated using C . elegans components that the Nuf2 / Ndc80 dimer bound more tightly to microtubules than the four - member complex , suggesting intracomplex inhibition ( 5 ) . This autoinhibitory conformation is reminiscent of kinesins and my - osin V , which fold into inhibited states that prevent interaction between motor domains and the cytoskeleton in the absence of cargo ( 32 – 35 ) . We propose that MIND binding to Spc24 / Spc25 relieves this autoinhibition via steric hindrance or allosteric ac - tivation , by interfering with the intracomplex interactions that stabilize the folded state of Ndc80c , and thus promotes its binding to microtubules . Autoinhibition of the Ndc80 complex could help during S - phase , when premature microtubule binding might interfere with kinetochore assembly . MIND - dependent relief of this autoinhibition could ensure that Ndc80 is activated only after it is successfully in - corporated into the kinetochore . It could also explain why Ndc80 is detected only at the kinetochore whereas other microtubule binding components of the kinetochore are also detected all 0 1 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 . 05 0 . 07 4 Residence Time ( s ) 8 16 12 N - GFP n - 121 - GFP M - GFP / N M - GFP / n - 121 n - 121 - GFP R e s i den c e T i m e ( s ) N - GFP M - GFP / N M - GFP / n - 121 2 0 3 1 4 p = . 003 p = . 58 1 . 7 ± 0 . 3s 3 . 1 ± 0 . 4s2 . 7 ± 0 . 2s2 . 9 ± 0 . 2s p = . 005 B S u r v i v a l P r obab ili t y Ndc80 - 121c Ndc80c MIND - Ndc80 - 121c MIND - Ndc80c A Ndc80 Nuf2 Spc25 Spc24 N - terminal tail Loop Helical hairpin ndc80 - 121 MIND CH domains Fig . 5 .

Cnn1 provides a distinct Ndc80 receptor during anaphase ( 13 , 15 , 16 ) . It will therefore be interesting to learn whether and how Cnn1 affects Ndc80 ’ s microtubule affinity . Altogether , our results highlight the previously unidentified regulation of the microtubule - binding activity of an outer ki - netochore component by a central kinetochore complex . We propose that modulating the conformation of microtubule cou - plers is a way to regulate the strength of microtubule attach - ments throughout mitosis .

Sucrose gradients [ 5 – 30 % ( wt / vol ) ] were generated by layering 250 μ L of 5 % , 13 . 8 % , 21 . 6 % , and 30 % sucrose in 50 mM NaPO 4 , 100 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 0 , and allowing a continuous gradient to form for 3 h at 4 °C . Then 1 – 2 μ M pu - rified MIND - His 6 and Ndc80 - His 6 complex were mixed at 1 : 1 molar ratio for 15 min at room temperature before loading onto gradient . Reactions were ultracentrifuged at 166 , 000 × g at 4 °C for 5 h , and 16 – 18 sequential fractions were collected and ana - lyzed by SDS / PAGE , staining with Coomassie Blue . Sedimen - tation coefficients were determined by comparing to elution of known standard proteins ( BSA , catalase , and aldolase ) . Plasmid Shuffle Assay . Endogenous NSL1 or MTW1 was deleted in a diploid strain with a KanMX cassette and then transformed with a WT copy of NSL1 or MTW1 under its endogenous pro - moter on a URA3 plasmid . Cells were sporulated , and haploids were selected . Haploids containing both KanMX and URA3 markers were transformed with a WT or mutated gene ( nsl1 - 4D or mtw1 - 220 ) under its endogenous promoters on a LEU2 plas - mid . Positive colonies were selected on SD - Leu for 3 d at 30 °C . Individual clones were grown to log phase in SD - Leu media and then plated in 10 - fold dilutions on synthetic complete and 1 mg · mL − 1 5 - FOA plates . Growth was assessed after 48 h at 30 °C . Cross - Linking of Recombinant MIND / Ndc80 Complex and Mass Spec - trometry Analysis . The MIND / Ndc80 co - complex ( 26 μ g in 133 μ L of either 100 mM NaCl or 300 mM NaCl , 50 mM NaPO 4 buffer , pH 7 ) was cross - linked for 2 min at room temperature with disuccinimidyl suberate ( 0 . 3 mM final ; Pierce ) . The reaction mix was quenched with 10 μ L of 500 mM NH 4 HCO 3 , and the buffer was exchanged to HB500 ( 40 mM Hepes , 500 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 5 ) using protein desalting spin columns ( Pierce ) according to the manufac - turer ’ s protocol . Cross - linked proteins were subsequently reduced with 10 mM DTT for 30 min at 37 °C , alkylated with 15 mM io - doacetamide for 30 min at room temperature , and digested with trypsin ( at a substrate to enzyme ratio of 60 : 1 ) overnight at room temperature with shaking . Samples were acidified with 5 M HCl and stored at − 80 °C . Samples ( 0 . 75 μ g ) were loaded onto a fused - silica capillary tip column ( 75 - μ m i . d . ) packed with 40 cm of Reprosil - Pur C18 - AQ ( 3 - μ m bead diameter ; Dr . Maisch ) . Peptides were eluted from the column at 250 nL · min − 1 using a gradient of 2 – 35 % aceto - nitrile ( in 0 . 1 % formic acid ) over 120 min , followed by 35 – 60 % acetonitrile over 10 min . Mass spectrometry was performed on a Q - Exactive ( Thermo Scientific ) , operated using data - dependent acquisition where a maximum of six MS / MS spectra were ac - quired per MS spectrum ( scan range of m / z 400 – 1 , 600 ) . At m / z 200 , the resolution for MS and MS / MS was 70 , 000 and 35 , 000 , re - spectively . Cross - linked peptides were identified using the Kojak cross - link identification software ( www . kojak - ms . org ) . The results of Kojak were exported directly to Percolator ( 43 ) to produce a statistically validated set of cross - linked peptide identifications at a false discovery rate threshold of 5 % . Immunoprecipitation . Anti - FLAG M2 affinity gel ( Sigma ) was prepared according to the manufacturers instructions and then incubated with purified 600 nM Ndc80c – FLAG complex for 1 h at 4 °C . Beads were subsequently washed 3 × 5 min with Tris - buffered saline ( TBS ) plus 0 . 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , and 1 μ m Dsn1 - His 6 – tagged purified MIND complex was added . Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and washed 3 × 5 min with TBS plus 0 . 1 % Nonidet P - 40 . Protein was eluted with 50 μ L of TBS plus 0 . 1 mg · mL − 1 3X FLAG peptide ( Sigma ) at room temperature for 30 min with gentle agitation . Eluate was removed and boiled with sample buffer and then run on SDS / PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti - His ( Genscript ) and anti - Ndc80 ( a gift from Arshad Desai , Ludwig Cancer Research Center , University of California , San Diego ) . Total MIND complex binding was measured using Dsn1 - His 6 band intensity normal - ized over Ndc80 band intensity for each reaction . Binding of mutant MIND complexes to the Ndc80 complex was calculated as a percentage of WT MIND complex binding . TIRF Microscopy . Custom instrumentation and flow cells were prepared as previously described ( 23 , 39 ) . For assays , coverslips were rinsed twice with ddH 2 0 and then incubated with “ rigor ” kinesin ( 44 ) in standard BB80 assay buffer ( 80 mM PIPES [ piperazine - N , N ′ - bis ( 2 - ethanesulfonic acid ) ] , pH 6 . 9 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 8 mg · mL − 1 BSA ) for 5 min . Alexa Fluor - 568 – labeled taxol - stabilized bovine microtubules were adhered to coverslips and rinsed with BB80 . All protein complexes were purified via gel filtration before TIRF microscopy . Dilutions of the protein complex of interest in BB80 supplemented with 1 mg · mL − 1 κ - casein and oxygen scavengers ( 200 μ g · mL − 1 glucose oxidase , 35 μ g · mL − catalase , 25 mM glucose , 5 mM DTT ) were flowed in and immediately imaged . GFP and Alexa Fluor - 568 chan - nels were imaged simultaneously using a cooled camera ( iXon 887 - BI ; Andor ) at 10 frames · s − 1 for 200 s . Controls assaying MIND - GFP alone , Dam1c alone , and Dam1c - GFP plus MIND Kudalkar et al . www . pnas . org / cgi / content / short / 1513882112 1 of 11 maintained the same TIRF microscopy assay conditions as the experimental assays . Dam1c - GFP and MIND were combined immediately before imaging . For imaging at 37 °C , an objective heater controller ( Bioptechs Inc . ) was used . Flow cells were preheated to 37 °C for at least 5 min before flowing in protein and imaging as described pre - viously in this section . Type 37 immersion oil was used to com - pensate for the change in temperature . The laser power of the GFP channel was increased 2 . 7 - fold to maintain the same GFP brightness as 25 °C reactions . For disassembling microtubule assays , solutions were prepared as in ref . 24 . Briefly , flow cells were washed and prepared with rigor kinesin as described previously in this section and then Alexa Fluor - 568 – labeled GMPCPP microtubule seeds were bound to coverslips and washed with BB80 . Microtubule growth buffer ( BB80 with 1 mM GTP and oxygen scavengers ) containing ∼ 2 mg · mL − 1 Alexa Fluor - 647 – labeled tubulin was introduced to the chamber and incubated with seeds for 10 min until extensions were present . The protein of interest was then introduced in BB80 with 1 mg · mL − 1 κ - casein and oxygen scavengers , and im - aging began immediately as the microtubules depolymerized upon buffer exchange . TIRF Microscopy Analysis . Single - particle tracking and analysis were done using custom Labview ( National Instruments ) and Igor Pro ( Wavemetrics ) software as previously described ( 23 , 39 ) . Briefly , kymographs were generated from 2 , 000 - frame movies , and in - dividual events were traced recording tracking position , total binding time , and GFP fluorescence . Binding events lasting less than 0 . 2 seconds or exhibiting a fluorescence signal less than 20 % over background noise were excluded from analysis . Boot - strapping analysis was used to determine mean residence time and the error of the mean . The mean squared displacement of each complex was plotted against time , and a one - dimensional diffu - sion constant was calculated using a weighted linear fit . Histo - grams of GFP fluorescence intensity were generated and fit with a Gaussian to determine average fluorescence of single particles . Microtubule tip - tracking analysis was performed by overlaying kymographs of GFP and 647 channels and then measuring the distance of GFP - particle tracking using Photoshop ( Adobe ) . Optical Trapping Bead Motility Assay . Streptavidin - coated 0 . 44 - μ m polystyrene beads were coated with biotinylated anti - His 5 ( Qiagen ) and 11 - pM beads were incubated with 40 nM His 6 - tagged Ndc80 or MIND complex as described ( 40 – 42 ) , such that each bead was decorated with ∼ 1 , 800 protein complexes . Flow cells were pre - pared using double - sided tape and plasma - cleaned coverslips and incubated with 30 μ L of 1 mg · mL − 1 biotinylated BSA ( Vector Laboratories ) for 10 min at 50 °C , followed by BRB80 ( 80 mM PIPES , pH 6 . 9 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA ) wash , 30 μ L of 1 mg · mL − 1 avidin DN ( Vector Laboratories ) for 2 min at room temperature , and another BRB80 wash . GMPCPP bio - tinylated tubulin seeds in BRB80 were bound for 2 min and washed with 37 °C growth buffer ( BB80 plus 1 mM GTP ) . Pro - tein - coated beads were introduced into the flow chambers in growth buffer with 1 . 4 mg · mL − 1 tubulin , 200 μ g · mL − 1 glucose oxidase , 35 μ g · mL − 1 catalase , 25 mM glucose , 1 mM DTT . For MIND / Ndc80c assays , His 6 - tagged MIND and FLAG - tagged Ndc80 complex were preassembled into a co - complex and sub - jected to size exclusion gel filtration as described under Protein Expression and Purification . For assays with MIND , Ndc80 , and Dam1 complexes , 20 nM His 6 - tagged MIND beads were pre - pared as described previously in this section , and then 40 nM free FLAG - tagged Ndc80 complex and 2 nM free Dam1 com - plex were added . For controls ( i . e . , MIND decorated beads with no protein in solution and GFP decorated beads and undeco - rated beads , both with Ndc80c in solution ) , all beads and soluble proteins were maintained at the concentrations used in the ex - perimental reactions . For each condition , a bead was manipulated to make contact with a microtubule . If the bead – microtubule contact could not withstand any amount of force , then it was considered to be a nonbinder . Optical trap assays were performed at 26 °C using custom in - strumentation to capture and manipulate beads as described ( 40 ) . Constant force assays using His 6 - Ndc80c beads and MIND - His / Ndc80c - FLAG beads were performed as described ( 40 ) . Then , 2 . 5 pN of force was applied in the direction of microtubule growth through rounds of assembly and disassembly . Bead po - sition vs . time was analyzed using custom Igor Pro software , and attachment lifetime was calculated . Rupture force assays were performed as described ( 24 , 25 , 45 ) . Once beads were bound to microtubule tips , a test force of 1 pN was applied , and only beads that tracked with ∼ 100 nm of tip growth were subjected to ramping force of 0 . 25 pN · s − 1 until detachment . Records of force vs . time were collected , and maximum rupture force was de - termined using custom Igor Pro software .

Stokes radii for Ndc80c , MIND , and MIND / Ndc80c were calculated using the equation derived from the linear fit : Ndc80c = 111 Å , MIND = 79 Å , MIND / Ndc80c = 134 Å . ( C ) Velocity sedimentation analysis of Ndc80c , MIND , and MIND / Ndc80c run on a 5 – 30 % sucrose gradient split into 16 sequential fractions ; n = 2 . Representative elution fractions for each complex across gradient are shown in Coomassie - stained gel ; fraction 1 corresponds to the top of the gradient . Some stoichiometric MIND / Ndc80c oligomers are visible in later fractions . BSA ( 4 . 4 S ) , aldolase ( 7 . 4 S ) , and catalase ( 11 . 4 S ) were run as standards ( positions indicated by vertical lines ) , and a linear fit was determined to find the S values for experimental complexes : Ndc80c = 4 . 24 S , MIND = 5 . 42 S , MIND / Ndc80c = 5 . 89 S . Using the S value and stokes radius , the molecular mass of the MIND / Ndc80c complex was determined to be 331 . 8 kDa , within 0 . 04 % of the expected molecular mass of a stoichiometric MIND / Ndc80c complex ( 333 kDa ) . The frictional ratio of MIND / Ndc80c was also calculated using the S value and stokes radius . MIND / Ndc80c exhibits a frictional ratio of 2 . 7 , indicating that it is highly elongated . ( Below ) A sucrose gradient from a repeat experiment split into 18 sequential fractions to more clearly visualize the MIND / Ndc80c peak centered at 5 . 89 S .
