1 Multiple E3 ligases control tankyrase stability and function Jerome Perrard and Susan Smith 1 1 Corresponding author Susan Smith Phone : 212 - 263 - 2540 Email : susan . smith @ med . nyu . edu 2 New York University School of Medicine Department of Pathology New York , NY 10016 2 Abstract Tankyrase 1 and 2 are ADP - ribosyltransferases that use NAD + as a substrate to catalyze polyADP - Ribose ( PAR ) onto themselves and their protein binding partners . Tankyrases have diverse cellular functions , ranging from resolution of telomere cohesion to activation of the Wnt / β - catenin signaling pathway . Robust and specific small molecule tankyrase inhibitors have been developed and are being investigated for cancer therapies . Tankyrase is regulated by the PAR - binding E3 ligase RNF146 , which promotes K48 - linked polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of PARylated tankyrases and their PARylated partners . We have identified a novel interaction between tankyrase and a distinct class of E3 ligases : the RING - UIM ( Ubiquitin - Interacting Motif ) family . We show that RING - UIM E3 ligases ( specifically RNF114 and RNF166 ) bind and stabilize monoubiquitylated tankyrase and promote K11 - linked diubiquitylation . This action competes with RNF146 - mediated K48 - linked polyubiquitylation and degradation , leading to stabilization of tankyrase and to a subset of its binding partners , including Angiomotin , a protein that functions in cancer signaling pathways . Moreover , we identify multiple PAR - binding E3 ligases ( in addition to RNF146 ) that promote ubiquitylation of tankyrase and induce stabilization or degradation . Discovery of this novel K11 ubiquitylation of tankyrase that opposes K48 - mediated degradation along with identification of multiple PAR - binding E3 ligases that ubiquitylate tankyrase , provide new insights into mechanisms of tankyrase regulation and may offer new uses for tankyrase inhibitors in cancer therapy . 3 Introduction Tankyrase 1 and 2 are related multifunctional proteins that act in many cellular pathways and impact human diseases , including cancer ( Haikarainen et al , 2014 ; Hsiao & Smith , 2008 ; Matsumoto & Rottapel , 2023 ; Zamudio - Martinez et al , 2021 ) . Tankyrases have a similar primary structure consisting of a C - terminal catalytic PARP domain , a SAM ( sterile alpha module ) , a 24 ankyrin repeat domain , and an N - terminal HPS ( His , Pro , and Ser ) domain of unknown function , unique to tankyrase 1 ( Smith et al , 1998 ) . The SAM domain promotes homo - and hetero - oligomerization of tankyrase 1 and 2 , and polymerization is required for full catalytic activity ( De Rycker & Price , 2004 ; Fan et al , 2018 ; Mariotti et al , 2016 ; Riccio et al , 2016 ) . The ankyrin domain is organized into five ankyrin repeat clusters ( ARCs ) , which serve as a basic unit for recognizing an eight amino acid segment Rxx ( G / P / A ) xGxx in its binding partners ( De Rycker et al , 2003 ; Eisemann et al , 2016 ; Guettler et al , 2011 ; Sbodio & Chi , 2002 ; Seimiya & Smith , 2002 ) . A distinguishing feature of tankyrases is their ability to interact through the ARCs with a broad range of binding partners ( Azarm & Smith , 2020 ) . Proteomic and in silico screens have identified hundreds of potential tankyrase binding proteins ( TBPs ) ( Bhardwaj et al , 2017 ; Guettler et al . , 2011 ; Li et al , 2017 ) . Over 40 human TBPs have been validated by co - immunoprecipitation ; almost all contain an RxxxxG sequence that binds to the ankyrin repeat domains of both tankyrase 1 and 2 ( Azarm & Smith , 2020 ) . Binding is independent of catalytic activity . Tankyrases localize throughout the cell . A number of tankyrase partners act to recruit TNKS to a subcellular locale ; examples include TRF1 - mediated recruitment to telomeres ( Bisht et al , 2012 ; Hsiao & Smith , 2008 ) , NuMA - mediated recruitment to spindle poles ( Chang et al , 2009 ; Chang et al , 2005 ) , and IRAP - mediated recruitment to Glut 4 vesicles ( Chi & Lodish , 2000 ) . Tankyrase 1 and 2 have the same binding partners and mostly overlapping functions ( Azarm & Smith , 2020 ; Hsiao & Smith , 2008 ) , hence herein we refer to them collectively as tankyrase ( TNKS ) . An unanticipated function for tankyrase in protein degradation came from a colorectal cancer screen ( Huang et al , 2009 ) . The majority of colorectal cancers result from activation of the Wnt / β - catenin signaling pathway ( Song et al , 2014 ) . Wnt controls the stability of the transcriptional coactivator β - catenin . In the absence of the Wnt signal , a cytoplasmic “β - catenin destruction complex” containing the key concentration - limiting component Axin promotes degradation of β - catenin . Upon Wnt activation , Axin is degraded leading to increased β - catenin protein that then enters the nucleus to activate transcription . A chemical genetic screen for inhibitors of this pathway identified XAV939 , a small molecule inhibitor of tankyrase ( Huang et al . , 2009 ) . Tankyrase was shown to positively modulate this pathway ; tankyrase - mediated PARylation of Axin led to its degradation , resulting in β - catenin stabilization ( Huang et al . , 2009 ) . 4 Subsequently , RNF146 was identified as the PAR - directed RING E3 ligase that regulates degradation of Axin ( Callow et al , 2011 ; Zhang et al , 2011 ) . RNF146 interacts with PARylated substrates through its internal WWE domain that binds to iso - ADP - ribose , the internal unit of the PAR polymer ( Kang et al , 2011 ; Wang et al , 2012 ; Zhou et al , 2011 ) . RNF146 promotes K48 - linked polyubiquitylation and degradation of PARylated tankyrase and PARylated targets . Many targets have been identified , including : 3BP2 ( c - ABL SH3 domain binding protein 2 ) ( Levaot et al , 2011 ) ; BLZF1 ( basic leucine zipper factor 1 ) ( Zhang et al . , 2011 ) ; CASC3 ( cancer susceptibility factor 3 ) ( Zhang et al . , 2011 ) ; PTEN , a critical tumor suppressor ( Li et al , 2015 ) ; and AMOT ( Angiomotin ) , a regulator of YAP ( Yes - associated protein ) , an oncoprotein that is overexpressed in various cancers ( Wang et al , 2015 ) . A whole proteome screen for proteins stabilized in HEK293T cells deleted for tankyrases ( TNKS1 / 2 DKO ) identified most of these and many additional proteins ( Bhardwaj et al . , 2017 ) . Thus , tankyrase - mediated degradation can impact a range of cellular targets and pathways ( Matsumoto & Rottapel , 2023 ) . Considering the role of tankyrase in diverse pathways , we sought to determine if there were other E3 ligases ( in addition to RNF146 ) that could influence the stability of PARylated tankyrase and its PARylated partners . Here we describe a novel interaction between tankyrase and a distinct class of E3 ligases : the RING - UIM ( Ubiquitin - Interacting Motif ) family ( Giannini et al , 2008 ; Zhang et al , 2018 ) . We show that unlike all other tankyrase binding proteins , which interact with the ankyrin domain , the RING - UIMs ( specifically RNF114 and RNF166 ) bind the catalytic SAMPARP domain . We show that RNF166 promotes K11 - linked ubiquitylation of tankyrase , dependent on tankyrase catalytic activity . This novel tankyrase modification competes with RNF146 - mediated K48 - linked polyubiquitylation and degradation to promote stabilization of tankyrase and at least one binding partner , Angiomotin . We additionally identify several PAR - binding E3 ligases that can influence tankyrase levels . Together our work reveals a complex network for regulating levels of PARylated tankyrase and its partners . Results Tankyrase binds RING - UIM E3 ligases . A previous proteomic screen used an immunoprecipitation / mass spectrometry approach to identify tankyrase binding partners from HEK293T cells overexpressing tankyrase 1 or 2 ( Li et al . , 2017 ) . In this study , to distinguish binding partners that were dependent on catalytic activity , cells were treated with the tankyrase inhibitor ( TNKSi ) XAV939 or DMSO as control . Over 100 significant ( known and novel ) targets were identified in the XAV939 - treated cells that overlapped substantially with the DMSO control group . This was expected since almost all tankyrase binding proteins bind the ankyrin domain , 5 independent of tankyrase catalytic PARP activity . However , a small number of proteins were highly enriched in the DMSO - treated control compared to the XAV939 - treated cells , indicating a role for catalytic activity . Among them were several E3 ligases : the known TNKS - binding protein RNF146 ( a PAR - binding E3 ligase ) and three new tankyrase binding E3 ligases ( RNF114 , RNF166 , and RNF138 ) that drew our attention because they were all members of the same ( RING - UIM E3 ligase ) family ( Giannini et al . , 2008 ; Zhang et al . , 2018 ) . The family , which has four members in total ( with the addition of RNF125 ) , is not well characterized . RNF114 , 166 , and 125 have been reported in association with innate immunity , IFN - signaling pathways , and T cell activation ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) , and RNF138 in association with DNA repair ( Bekker - Jensen & Mailand , 2015 ) . Their primary structure is comprised of an N - terminal RING E3 ligase domain followed by a single C2HC zinc finger ( ZnF ) , two atypical C2H2 ZnFs that resemble the Zn finger - like domains of the plant drought - induced Di19 gene family ( Milla et al , 2006 ) , and a C - terminal ubiquitin interacting motif ( UIM ) ( Fig . 1A ) . Unlike RNF146 , they do not contain a WWE domain or any other known PAR - binding motif . RNF166 contains two potential TBSs and RNF125 a myristylation site ( Fig . 1A ) . We initially investigated RNF166 since it ( unlike the other three ) contained potential TBSs . We transfected Flag - epitope - tagged RNF166 ( FlagRNF166 ) and vector or FlagBAP ( bacterial alkaline phosphatase ) as a negative control into HeLa cells ( Fig . 1B ) . To test the effect of inhibiting tankyrase catalytic activity , the RNF166 transfected cells were treated with 10 µM tankyrase inhibitor # 8 ( TNKSi ) ( Haikarainen et al , 2013 ) . Note that TNKSi leads to stabilization of tankyrase ( Fig . 1B , Input lane 4 ) because it prevents autoPARylation and degradation by the PAR - binding E3 ligase RNF146 ( Callow et al . , 2011 ; Zhang et al . , 2011 ) . The Flag IP shows that FlagRNF166 ( but not BAP or vector ) coimmunoprecipitated endogenous TNKS1 ( Fig . 1B , IP lane 7 ) . This was reduced by TNKSi treatment ( Fig . 1B , IP lane 8 ) , despite increased levels of TNKS1 in TNKSi cells . These data indicate a robust interaction between TNKS1 and RNF166 that is dependent on TNKS1 catalytic activity , consistent with identification of RNF166 ( specifically in the absence of TNKSi ) in the screen described above . To determine if the RNF166 TBSs are required for TNKS binding , we generated point mutations in the essential Gly of each TBS : G19A and G47A , as well as a double mutation 2GA ( see Fig 1A ) . As shown in Fig . 1C , FlagRNF166 ( WT or mutants ) robustly coimmunoprecipitated endogenous TNKS1 , indicating that TNKS1 binding to RNF166 is independent of the TBSs . To further analyze the RING - UIM E3 ligase family we introduced each member into TNKS1 / 2 DKO HEK293T ( Bhardwaj et al . , 2017 ) cells along with TNKS1 . As shown in Fig . 1D , RNF114 and RNF166 expression led to a dramatic increase in TNKS1 protein level along with a shift in migration ( lanes 2 and 3 ) . 6 RNF125 and 138 had no effect , perhaps due to their low level of expression . RNF146 led to a reduction in TNKS1 ( lane 6 ) , consistent with its role in degradation . The Flag IP shows that all four RING - UIMs and RNF146 ( but not BAP ) coimmunoprecipitated TNKS1 , most notably with RNF114 ( lane 8 ) and RNF166 ( lane 9 ) . We next performed the same analysis in the presence or absence of TNKSi . As shown in Fig . 1E , the increase in TNKS1 protein level / modification and immunoprecipitation induced by RNF114 and RNF166 was abrogated by TNKSi treatment ( Fig . 1E , lanes 14 and 16 ) . TNKSi had no effect on the interaction between TNKS1 and RNF125 or 138 ( lanes 18 and 20 ) . In the presence of TNKSi , all four members immunoprecipitated similar levels of TNKS1 ( Fig . 1E , lanes 14 , 16 , 18 , and 20 ) . The lack of effect of RNF125 and 138 on TNKS1 could be due to their low level of expression . However , when expressed side by side with RNF166 at a level that induces TNKS1 increase , RNF125 and RNF138 did not impact TNKS1 levels / modification ( Fig . 1F ) . These results show that all four members bind TNKS1 but only RNF114 and 166 impact TNKS1 level / modification and do so in a manner that requires TNKS1 catalytic activity . The stimulation of TNKS1 by RNF114 and RNF166 was robust and reproducible . Quantification showed that RNF114 or 166 induced a two to four - fold increase in tankyrase protein ( Fig . 1G , top panel and H ) . Immunoblot analysis with antibody against PAR showed a similar , ( or slightly higher ) increase in PAR levels ( Fig . 1G , middle panel ) . Thus , RNF114 and RNF166 stimulate an increase overall in the level of PARylated tankyrase . We next compared the interaction of the RING - UIM E3s with wild type ( WT ) TNKS1 versus a catalytically dead ( CD ) mutant ( TNKS1 . HE / A ) ( Cook et al , 2002 ) . As shown in Fig . 1I , we again observed a dramatic effect of RNF114 and 166 on TNKS1 level / modification ( lanes 2 and 6 ) and immunoprecipitation ( lanes 14 and 18 ) , but only with WT , not CD , consistent with the effect of TNKSi . To determine if the preferred interaction of RNF114 and 166 with WT TNKS1 over CD was due to a preference for PARylated protein , we measured their ability to coimmunoprecipitate PARP1 . As shown in Fig . 1I , only RNF146 , which binds to PARylated PARP1 through its WWE - PAR binding domain , coimmunoprecipitated PARP1 ( lanes 17 and 23 ) . None of the RING - UIM E3 ligases coimmunoprecipitated PARP1 , suggesting that they do not bind PARylated protein . Of note , CD TNKS1 is nonspecifically pulled down in the BAP IP control ( lane 19 ) . Finally , we showed an interaction between endogenous proteins . Immunoprecipitation of endogenous RNF114 with anti - RNF114 antibody coimmunoprecipitated endogenous TNKS1 from HEK293T cells ( Fig . 1J , Lane 4 ) . We did not detect endogenous RNF114 in the TNKS1 immunoprecipitation , which is often the case due to the great number of TBPs . 7 Together our data indicate that all four RING - UIM E3s interact with TNKS . RNF114 and 166 lead to a reproducible increase in the level of tankyrase protein , an altered migration , and a robust coimmunoprecipitation , dependent on TNKS catalytic activity . RNF125 and RNF138 bind TNKS , but do not affect TNKS levels or modification . Map the interacting domains between RNF166 and TNKS . The RING - UIM E3s have four domains . We generated mutations or deletions in each domain of RNF166 to determine which domains are important for binding ( Fig . 2A ) . For the N - terminal catalytic RING , we mutated the essential ZnFn Cysteines ( C33S / C36S ; R * * ) ( Heath et al , 2016 ) . For the adjacent C2HC domain , which has been shown to cooperate with the RING domain ( Bijlmakers et al , 2016 ) , we mutated the first Cysteine ( C98G ; C * ) of the ZnFn . For the Di19 , whose function is unknown , we generated separate point mutations in the first cysteine of each C2H2 ZnFn ( C152R ; D1 * and C182G ; D2 * ) . For the UIM , we deleted the C - terminal 17 amino acids , 221 to 237 ( UIM ∆ ; U ∆ ) . We transfected the mutants and measured coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous tankyrase ( Fig . 2B ) . We observed two classes of mutants . The RING , UIM ∆ , and C2HC , mutants retained partial binding ( lanes 10 , 11 , and 12 ) , whereas each of the Di19 mutants showed no binding ( lanes 13 and 14 ) . Since some of the RNF166 mutants showed a lower expression than RNF166 WT we repeated the analysis . TNKS1 was cotransfected with various concentrations of DNA for each of the RNF166 mutants to obtain comparable levels of RNF166 mutant proteins . As shown in Fig . 2C , even when the mutant proteins were expressed at levels similar to or greater than the WT , we observed the same two classes of binding mutants ; partial binding for the RING , UIM ∆ , and C2HC , mutants ( lanes 3 , 4 , and 5 ) and no binding for the Di19 mutants ( lanes 6 and 7 ) . The Di19 domain appears to be essential for binding , while the other three domains contribute to binding to a lesser extent . To determine the minimal domains required to bind to TNKS1 , we generated constructs expressing the Di19 domain alone or with the UIM ( Fig . 2D ) and measured their ability to coimmunoprecipitate endogenous tankyrase in the presence and absence of TNKSi ( Fig . 2E ) . Note again that the inhibitor leads to increased levels of tankyrase protein because the catalytically inactive protein does not undergo PAR - dependent degradation by RNF146 ( see Input ; ( - ) versus ( + ) TNKSi ) . In the presence of TNKSi , Di19 ( lane 8 ) , Di19UIM ( lane 6 ) , and full length ( FL ) ( lane 4 ) RNF166 coimmunoprecipitated similar levels of tankyrase ( Fig . 2E , top panel ) . This indicates that the Di19 domain alone is sufficient to bind tankyrase and further , when tankyrase catalytic activity is inhibited , the three constructs bind in a similar way . However , the constructs behave differently in the absence of TNKSi when 8 tankyrase is catalytically active . Here we observed minimal binding with Di19 ( lane 7 ) . Addition of the UIM to the Di19 ( Di19UIM ) led to an increase in TNKS1 binding and a slight shift in migration ( lane 5 ) and addition of the RING - C2HC to the Di19UIM ( to generate the full - length protein ) led to even greater binding and a greater shift in migration ( lane 3 ) . The increased binding is particularly striking considering the lower level of TNKS1 ( in the Input ) in the absence of TNKSi . The results above suggests that the UIM domain stimulates binding to TNKS1 and induces a change in migration of TNKS1 . To determine if ubiquitin - binding is required for the increase in TNKS1 protein binding and modification that we observe with RNF166 FL , we mutated two of the conserved amino acids in the UIM that are required for ubiquitin - binding ( A229P / S233Q ; U * * ) ( based on the RNF125 UIM mutant ) ( Giannini et al . , 2008 ) ( Fig . 2D ) and compared it side by side with WT RNF166 . As shown in Fig . 2F , top panel , WT RNF166 led to a stimulation in TNKS1 binding and a shift in migration ( lane 3 ) that was blocked by TNKSi ( lane 4 ) . Mutation of the ubiquitin binding domain ( U * * ) abrogated the ability of RNF166 to stimulate binding and modification of TNKS1 ( lane 5 ) , but still allowed minimal binding in the presence of TNKSi ( lane 6 ) , similar to deletion of the UIM ( U ∆ ) ( lanes 7 and 8 ) . Together these data indicate a critical role for the UIM in binding and induction of TNKS1 modification . The UIM alone ( fused to GFP ; GFPUIM ) does not bind TNKS1 in the presence or absence of TNKSi ( lanes 9 and 10 ) . Together these data indicate three levels of interaction between RNF166 and TNKS ( Fig . 2G ) . One , the Di19 domain is necessary and sufficient for TNKS binding . However , Di19 does not recapitulate RNF166 WT TNKS binding . Unlike RNF166 WT , Di19 binding is insensitive to TNKSi and has no effect on TNKS level / modification . Two , the UIM domain binds , but it cannot bind on its own without the Di19 domain . The UIM stimulates TNKS level / modification and is sensitive to TNKSi . Three , the RING - C2H2 further stimulates TNKS levels and modification and ( due to the UIM ) is sensitive to TNKSi . Determine the interacting domain in tankyrase We next mapped the domain in tankyrase that is required for RNF166 binding . To date over 40 TBPs have been identified and almost all of them bind to TNKS ARCs using RxxxxG TBSs ( Azarm & Smith , 2020 ) . As described above , RNF166 has two TBSs , but they are not required for binding to TNKS and moreover , the other three RING - UIMs , which all bind TNKS , do not have TBSs . We thus considered that they might not bind to the ankyrin domain . To address this , we generated constructs to split TNKS1 into two Flag - epitope - tagged domains : HPSAnkyrin ( A ) and SAMPARP ( S ) ( Fig . 3A ) , and transfected them into TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells along with Myc - tagged RNF166 or TRF1 , the original and canonical tankyrase binding partner containing an ankryin repeat - binding TBS ( Smith et al . , 1998 ) . As shown in Fig . 3A ( lanes 11and 12 ) , 9 TRF1 binds to the HPS Ankyrin ( A ) domain , but not to the SAMPARP ( S ) domain . In contrast , RNF166 binds to the SAMPARP ( S ) domain and not to the HPSAnkyrin ( A ) domain ( lanes 9 and 10 ) . This is the first example of a tankyrase binding protein that binds to the SAMPARP and not the ankyrin domain of tankyrase . We compared RNF166 binding side by side with TRF1 binding to full - length endogenous tankyrase in the presence or absence of TNKSi . Flag - tagged BAP , RNF166 , Di19UIM , or TRF1 , was transfected into HeLa cells with or without TNKSi , and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti - Flag antibody ( Fig . 3B ) . TRF1 coimmunoprecipitated TNKS1 ( lanes 7 and 8 ) . Binding was greatly increased with TNKSi ( lane 8 ) , coincident with the increased level of TNKS1 in the Input . RNF166 and Di19UIM also coimmunoprecipitated TNKS1 , but in contrast to TRF1 , binding was greatly increased without TNKSi ( lanes 3 and 5 ) , which was particularly striking considering the reduced TNKS1 levels in the Input . Thus , RNF166 ( and Di19UIM ) exhibits an atypical pattern of binding to TNKS . Lastly , we asked if the SAMPARP domain of tankyrase was sufficient for interaction with the Di19UIM domain of RNF166 . We generated a Myc - tagged SAMPARP construct and cotransfected it into TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells along with Flag - tagged RNF166 FL or Di19UIM , treated with or without TNKSi , and immunoprecipitated the lysates with anti - Flag antibody . As shown in Fig . 3C , FlagRNF166 ( FL or Di19UIM ) coimmunoprecipitated MycSAMPARP . Binding was robust in the absence of TNKSi ( lanes 9 and 11 ) and reduced in the presence of TNKSi ( lanes 10 and 12 ) . Thus , we can recapitulate the binding and the TNKSi effect observed with the full - length proteins using the SAMPARP domain of tankyrase and the Di19UIM domain of RNF166 . Analyze the RNF166 - induced modification on tankyrase . To determine if the RNF166 - induced shift in TNKS1 mobility was due to ubiquitylation of TNKS1 , we transfected HA - ubiquitin ( HA - Ub ) along with FlagRNF166 and TNKS1 into TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells . Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti - HA antibody and blotted for TNKS1 and FlagRNF166 . As shown in Fig . 4A , RNF166 induced ubiquitylation of TNKS1 ( lane 7 ) . The modification was blocked by TNKSi ( lane 8 ) , consistent with the data in Fig . 1 showing that RNF166 increased the level / modification of TNKS1 , dependent on TNKS1 catalytic activity . Here , we detect two modified forms , which could represent mono and diubiquitylated TNKS . Note that we also detect some unmodified TNKS , which is likely due to its ability to oligomerize . Due to the difficulty in resolving high molecular weight forms of full - length tankyrase by SDS - PAGE , we next sought to recapitulate the ubiquitylation using the smaller interacting 10 domains defined above in Fig . 2 and 3 for each protein : the Di19UIM ( for RNF166 ) and the SAMPARP ( for TNKS ) . We cotransfected HA - Ub , FlagDi19UIM , and MycSAMPARP into TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells and immunoprecipitated the cell lysates with anti - HA antibody . As shown in Fig . 4B ( lane 7 ) , Di19UIM promotes ubiquitylation of SAMPARP . We observe a single form at a molecular weight consistent with monoubiquitylation . Monoubiquitylation of amino acids on a protein target occurs through the C - terminus of ubiquitin . Subsequent linkages occur though one of seven lysines in the ubiquitin protein itself . To confirm that the observed modification was indeed monoUb , we performed the assay with HA - Ub KO ( in which all seven lysines are mutated ) and observed the same band as with WT Ub , indicating a monoubiquitylation event ( Fig . 4B , lane 8 ) . Thus , the Di19UIM domain of RNF166 promotes monoubiquitylation of the SAMPARP domain of tankyrase . Notably , the Di19UIM fragment lacks the catalytic N - terminal E3 ligase RING domain of RNF166 and is therefore unlikely to catalyze the monoubiquitylation event directly , but rather , could instead ( through its UIM ) bind / stabilize a preexisting monoUbSAMPARP . Indeed , upon longer exposure we detect monoUbSAMPARP even in the absence of Di19 - UIM ( Fig . 4B , lane 6 , long exposure ) . We next sought to determine the role of the N - terminal RING - C2HC domain . We cotransfected TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells with HA - Ub , FlagDi19UIM , and MycSAMPARP ( as above in Fig . 4B ) , additionally , we introduced full length RNF114 or 166 . Ubiquitylated proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti - HA antibody . With the Di19UIM only , we observed monoUbSAMPARP ( Fig . 4C , lane 8 ) . Upon addition of RNF114 or RNF166 , we still observe monoUbSAMPARP , and we see slower migrating forms consistent with di - ( major ) and tri - UbSAMPARP ( minor ) ( lanes 9 and 10 , respectively ) . If we leave out the Di19UIM and use the full length RNF114 or RNF166 alone , we detect only di - and tri - UbSAMPARP ( lanes 11 and 12 , respectively ) . These data indicate that the RING - C2HC domain of RNF114 or 166 promotes diubiquitylation of SAMPARP . We next determined the nature of the ubiquitylation on diUbSAMPARP . If it resulted from a second monoUb linkage event , i . e . to a lysine on SAMPARP , then any form of HA - Ub ( WT or mutant ) would support formation , as it did for monoUb SAMPARP ( shown in Fig . 4B ) . Alternatively , if it resulted from a diUb linkage event , then it would depend on a lysine in the HA - Ub protein . To address this , TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells were cotransfected with HA - Ub WT and various mutants , FlagDi19UIM or FlagRNF166 ( FL ) , and MycSAMPARP , and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti - HA antibody . The HA - Ub mutants consisted of HA - KO ( all seven lysines mutated ) or HA - Ub containing a mutation at every lysine except the one indicated ( K : 6 , 11 , 27 , 29 , 33 , 48 , 63 ) . As shown in Fig . 4D , using WT HA - Ub , Di19UIM induced monoUb 11 ( lane 2 ) and RNF166 induced diUb ( lane 3 ) . With KO HA - Ub we observed a similar diUb band but , in addition , a strong faster migrating band that could be monoUb ( lane 4 ) . All the other HA - Ub mutants ( except one , K11 ; lane 6 ) gave a pattern similar to the KO . Only K11 resembled WT . To confirm the dependence of the WT pattern on a K11 linkage we performed the reaction with HA - Ub containing a K11R mutation . As shown in Fig . 4E , K11 Ub resembles WT ( lanes 7 and 8 ) , whereas , K11R resembles KO Ub ( lanes 9 and 10 ) confirming that the K11 linkage is essential and sufficient for the wild type pattern of ubiquitylation . We were surprised to see the diUb band when using KO - Ub , since it should only support monoUb . We reasoned that the diUb form could be generated using endogenous WT Ub , which is very abundant ( Cho et al , 2022 ) . To address this , we performed the analysis in an inducible shRNA ubiquitin knockdown cell line ( Shearer et al , 2022 ; Xu et al , 2009 ) . Cells were induced with dox for 48 hrs and then ( 24 hr prior to harvest ) cotransfected with FlagDi19UIM or FlagRNF166 ( FL ) , MycSAMPARP , and HA - Ub ( KO or K11 ; containing point mutations that render them resistant to the ubiquitin shRNA ) . The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti - HA antibody . As shown in Fig . 4F , with KO HA - Ub , Di19UIM induced monoUb ( lane 8 ) , as expected and as was shown above in Fig . 4B ( lane 8 ) . Moreover , with KO HA - Ub , RNF166 induced only monoUb ( Fig . 4F , lane 9 ) . We do not detect any diUb form with KO - Ub ( as we had in Fig . 4D and E when endogenous ubiquitin was present ) , indicating that the diUb form generated in Fig . 4D and E was likely due to endogenous ubiquitin and further that only WT or K11 Ub promote the diUb form . Finally , as an alternative approach to validate the K11 linkage , we used a K11 linkage - specific deubiquitinating enzyme , Cezanne ( Hospenthal et al , 2015 ; Takahashi et al , 2020 ) . TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells were transfected with MycSAMPARP , FlagRNF166 , and HA - Ub . Prior to gel analysis the samples were incubated for 0 or 30 min with or without Cezanne at a concentration known to cleave only K11 linkage ( Hospenthal et al . , 2015 ) . As shown in Fig . 4G ( lane 4 ) , the diUb form of SAMPARP was converted to the monoUb form following treatment with Cezanne . The above analyses were done with the SAMPARP domain of tankyrase . We , thus performed a similar analysis using full length TNKS . TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells were transfected with FlagTNKS1 , HA - Ub , and RNF166 and lysates immunoprecipitated with anti - Flag antibody . As shown in Fig . 4H , we detected an HA - Ub form of TNKS1 ( likely monoUb based on its migration in the gel ) ( lane 8 ) with WT HA - Ub , that was converted to a slower migrating form by RNF166 ( likely diUb ) ( lane 9 ) . K11 - Ub behaved like WT , promoting the diUb form ( lane 10 ) . However , K11R and KO promote the monoUb form ( lanes 11 and 12 ) . They also show the diUb form , but we think this is likely due to endogenous ubiquitin as we showed 12 above in Fig . 3E and F for SAMPARP . Together these data show that RNF166 or 114 induces K11 - linked diubiquitylation of tankyrase . Determine the impact or RNF166 and K11 - linked ubiquitylation on tankyrase . We have shown thus far that monoUbTNKS is a target for RNF166 - or RNF114 - mediated K11 d - ubiquitylation . K11 is an atypical ubiquitin linkage . While it has been shown to mark proteins for degradation , particularly in association with K48 in the form of K11 / K48 mixed chains , it has also been shown to promote protein stabilization ( Tracz & Bialek , 2021 ) . Indeed , a study on the innate immune pathway showed that K11 , rather than cooperate with K48 , could instead compete with K48 - linked polyubiquitylation ( Qin et al , 2014 ) . Here it was shown that competing E3 ligases ( RNF5 and RNF26 ) controlled the stability of STING a component of the cytosolic double - stranded DNA - sensing cGAS - cGAMP - STING pathway . Viral infection enhanced RNF5 interaction with STING , leading to STING K48 - linked polyUb and proteasomal degradation to evade the innate immune response ( Zhong et al , 2009 ) . However , a competing E3 ligase , RNF26 , promoted K11 - linked ubiquitylation of STING to protect it from K48 - linked polyUb and degradation ( Qin et al . , 2014 ) . We thus asked if RNF166 could compete with RNF146 - mediated K48 - linked polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation . TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells were transfected with FlagTNKS1 and HA - Ub , without additional E3 ligases or with RNF166 or RNF146 or both together , and immunoprecipitated with anti - Flag antibody . As shown in Fig . 5A , without an added E3 ligase , we observed monoUbTNKS1 ( lane 8 ) . Introduction of RNF166 induced the diUb form of TNKS1 and led to TNKS1 stabilization ( lane 7 ) . By contrast , introduction of RNF146 led to polyUbTNKS1 and TNKS1 degradation ( lane 9 ) . When both RNF166 and RNF146 were introduced , RNF166 competed with RNF146 to promote diUbTNKS1 over polyUbTNKS1 and to prevent tankyrase degradation ( lane 10 ) . To confirm the role of the specific ubiquitin linkages in this process , we performed the same analysis using ( in place of WT HA - Ub ) a mix of two specific linkages each with a unique tag : HA - K11 - Ub and Myc - K48 - Ub . TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells were transfected with FlagTNKS1 and the ubiquitin mix and analyzed by blotting with anti - HA or - Myc antibodies . In the absence of added E3 ligases , we observed low levels of mono - and poly - K11UbTNKS1 ( Fig . 5B , top panel , lane 8 ) and no K48 Ub ( second panel ) , likely due to degradation of that species . Introduction of RNF166 induced the K11diUbTNKS1 ( as well as a low level of K48diUbTNKS ) , and led to TNKS1 stabilization ( lane 7 ) . Introduction of RNF146 led to K11 and K48 polyUb TNKS1 and degradation of TNKS1 ( lane 9 ) , as described previously ( Callow et al . , 2011 ) . When both RNF166 and RNF146 are introduced , RNF166 competed with RNF146 ; it induced K11UbTNKS1 , 13 reduced K48 - linked polyUbTNKS1 , and promoted stabilization of TNKS1 ( lane 10 ) . Thus , as shown schematically in Fig . 5C , RNF166 - mediated K11 - linked diubiquitylation can compete with RNF146 - mediated K48 - linked polyubiquitylation to promote tankyrase stabilization over degradation . Determine the impact of RNF166 on TNKS binding partners Tankyrase regulates the cellular levels of a number of vital proteins . Since these TBPs are subject to PAR - dependent RNF146 - mediated degradation , we next asked if their stability could also be countered by RNF166 . We considered that RNF166 , TNKS1 , and a TBP could form a ternary complex , where RNF166 binds the SAMPARP domain and the TBP binds the ankyrin domain , resulting in RNF166 - mediated ubiquitylation and stabilization of the TBP ( Fig . 6A , schematic ) . We took a proteomic approach to identify TBPs that could be in a ternary complex . We transfected TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells with FlagRNF166 alone versus FlagRNF166 plus TNKS1 ( versus FlagBAP plus TNKS1 as a negative control ) and performed Flag immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry ( Supplemental Table 1 ) . We identified a number of TBPs in the Flag IP of RNF166 plus TNKS1 , consistent with formation of ternary complexes . Unexpectedly , a subset of those TBPs bound to RNF166 even in the absence of TNKS1 and further , their interaction with RNF166 was increased upon expression of TNKS1 ( Fig . 6A , Table ) . These TBPs are prime candidates for targets of RNF166 - mediated ubiquitylation and stabilization . We focused initially on the top hit , AMOT ( Angiomotin ) , a regulator of YAP ( Yes - associated protein ) , an oncoprotein that is overexpressed in various cancers ( Wang et al . , 2015 ) . To confirm the association of AMOT , we transfected TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells with Flag RNF166 with or without TNKS1 and performed Flag IPs . As shown in Fig . 6B , endogenous AMOT was coimmunoprecipitated by RNF166 alone ( lane 7 ) and it was enriched when TNKS1 was cotransfected ( lane 8 ) . We also observed a slower migrating form of AMOT , which could indicate ubiquitylation by RNF166 . To measure ubiquitylation of AMOT we transfected FlagAMOT , TNKS1 , HA - Ub , and MycRNF166 into TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells followed by IP with anti - Flag ( Fig . 4C ) or anti - HA ( Fig . 4D ) antibody . As shown in Fig . 4C , cotransfection of TNKS1 with AMOT led to a reduction in AMOT protein pull down ( lane 9 , top panel ) , likely due to TNKS1 - mediated PARylation ( lane 9 , second panel ) and degradation . However , when RNF166 was introduced along with TNKS1 , AMOT protein level was rescued ( lane 10 , top panel ) , and we observed diubiquitylation of AMOT ( lane 10 , third panel ) , as well as a concomitant reduction in AMOT PARylation ( lane 10 , second panel ) . These data suggest that RNF166 - mediated ubiquitylation of AMOT protects it from PARylation by TNKS1 and subsequent degradation . We confirmed the RNF166 / TNKS - dependent diubquitylation of AMOT using 14 HA - Ubiquitin immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting to detect FlagAMOT ( Fig . 6D , lane 10 , top panel ) . To determine if RNF166 ubiquitylates AMOT through a K11 linkage , TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells were cotransfected with FlagAMOT , MycRNF166 , TNKS1 , and four types of HA - Ub : WT ( all lysines wild type ) ; K11 ( every lysine mutated except K11 ) ; K11R ( only K11 lysine mutated ) ; or KO ( all lysines mutated ) and immunoprecipitated with Flag antibody . As shown in Fig . 6E , monoUbAMOT was detected when AMOT alone was transfected ( lane 8 ) . Addition of TNKS and RNF166 efficiently converted monoUbAMOT to higher molecular weight forms ( likely di - and tri - Ub ) with WT ( lane 9 ) or K11 HA - Ub ( lane 10 ) . Introduction of K11R ( lane 11 ) or K0 ( lane12 ) , led to appearance of the monoUb form , but some diUbAMOT remained likely due to endogenous ubiquitin as was shown above in Fig . 4 for TNKS1 . The data thus far suggest that RNF166 - induced K11 ubiquitylation could prevent the TNKS1 - mediated degradation of AMOT . To address this directly we monitored the levels of AMOT in response to TNKS1 and RNF166 in TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells . As shown in Fig . 6F , transfection of RNF166 alone had a minimal effect on AMOT levels ( lane 2 ) . TNKS1 alone led to loss of AMOT ( lane 3 ) as expected because TNKS PARylates AMOT and promotes RNF146 - mediated degradation . When RNF166 was introduced along with TNKS1 , it partially rescued AMOT levels ( lane 4 ) . The rescue was particularly striking since TNKS1 was increased over 5 - fold ( lane 4 ) yet it did not promote degradation of AMOT . Thus , RNF166 protects AMOT from TNKS1 - mediated degradation . Finally , we asked if RNF166 was required to maintain endogenous AMOT protein levels . As shown in Fig . 6G , siRNA mediated depletion of RNF166 led to a 20 - fold reduction in endogenous AMOT ( lanes 1 versus 2 ) . By contrast , the same depletion of RNF166 in TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells led to only a minor ( less than 2 - fold ) reduction ( lanes 3 versus 4 ) , validating a role for TNKS in RNF166 - mediated regulation of AMOT . Identify E3 ligases that target PARylated TNKS for ubiquitylation We have shown that RNF166 promotes K11 - linked ubiquitylation of TNKS1 , which can compete with K48 - linked ubiquitylation and promote TNKS1 stabilization . The N - terminal RING - C2HC domain catalyzes the reaction , while the C - terminal Di19 - UIM stabilizes the target , monoUbTNKS1 . We have shown that stabilization and ubiquitylation of monoUbTNKS1 is sensitive to TNKSi and does not occur on catalytically dead TNKS . However , it is not clear why the catalytic activity of TNKS is important . Unlike RNF146 , which contains a WWE - PAR - binding domain and binds PARylated proteins , RNF166 lacks a PAR - binding domain and does not bind to PARylated protein , ( shown for PARP1 ; see Fig . 1I ) . We consider the possibility that generation of monoUbTNKS ( the target for RNF166 - mediated K11 ubiquitylation ) requires 15 a catalytically active TNKS . Thus , we hypothesize that another E3 ligase ( perhaps a PAR - binding one ) is required to generate the target ( Fig . 7A , schematic ) . The most likely candidate is RNF146 . To determine if RNF146 was essential to generate monoUbTNKS1 we performed the analysis in RNF146 KO cells . We cotransfected Flag - Di19UIM , HA - Ub , and TNKS1 into RNF146 KO cells and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti - HA antibody . As shown in Fig . 7A , Di19UIM induced monoHA - Ub TNKS1 in the absence of RNF146 . Thus , there may be other PAR - binding E3 ligases that target TNKS1 . In theory , any protein with a PAR binding motif and a ubiquitin E3 ligase domain could be a candidate for a PAR - dependent E3 ligase that targets tankyrase ( Gatti et al , 2020 ; Wang et al . , 2012 ) . At least seven potential PAR - binding E3 ligases can be identified ( Fig . 7B ) : four have a WWE domain with a RING ( RNF146 , DTX1 , DTX2 , and DTX4 ) , two have WWE with a HECT ( TRIP12 and HUWE1 ) , and one has PBZ with a RING ( CHFR ) ( Ahel et al , 2008 ) . Three ( RNF146 , TRIP12 , and CHFR ) have been shown to target PARP1 for ubiquitylation and degradation ( Gatti et al . , 2020 ; Kang et al . , 2011 ; Liu et al , 2013 ; Zhou et al . , 2011 ) . Only one ( RNF146 ) has been shown to act on tankyrase ( Callow et al . , 2011 ; Zhang et al . , 2011 ) . First , we asked if the E3 ligases bind TNKS1 . TNKS1 was transfected into TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells along with Flag - tagged BAP , RNF146 , CHFR , DTX1 , DTX2 , or DTX4 and immunoprecipitated with anti - Flag antibody . As shown in Fig . 7C , the E3 ligases coimmunoprecipitated TNKS1 ( lanes 8 - 12 ) . Indeed , despite low levels of expression for the DTX plasmids , all showed a robust immunoprecipitation of TNKS1 ( lanes 10 - 12 ) , similar to RNF146 and CHFR . We focused first on CHFR . FlagCHFR or RNF166 was cotransfected with TNKS1 into TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells . In contrast to RNF166 , which leads to stabilization of TNKS ( Fig . 7D , lane 2 ) , CHFR led to loss of TNKS1 ( lane 3 ) that was rescued with TNKSi ( lane 4 ) . Coimmunoprecipitation of CHFR with TNKS1 was also reduced with TNKSi ( lanes 7 and 8 ) . These data suggest that CHFR may be acting more like RNF146 to stimulate degradation of TNKS1 . To address this , we transfected TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells with FlagTNKS1 , HA - Ub , and MycRNF146 or CHFR and performed Flag immunoprecipitation . As shown in Fig . 7E , in the absence of E3 ligases we detected monoUbTNKS1 ( lane 8 ) . Addition of RNF146 or CHFR induced polyUbTNKS1 ( lanes 9 and 11 ) , that was stabilized by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( lanes 10 and 12 ) . Thus CHFR , like RNF146 , targets TNKS1 for polyubiquitylation and degradation by the proteasome . We next turned to the DTX proteins to determine if their interaction with TNKS1 depended on TNKS1 catalytic activity . As shown in Fig . 7F , DTX1 , DTX2 , and DTX4 coimmunoprecipitated TNKS ( lanes 3 , 5 , and 7 ) and coimmunoprecipitation was abrogated by treatment with TNKSi ( lanes 4 , 6 , and 8 ) . To measure a role for the DTX proteins in ubiquitylation of TNKS1 , we cotransfected MycDTX1 , 2 , or 4 , or 16 MycRNF166 with FlagTNKS1 and HA - Ub into TNKS1 / 2 DKO cells , and performed Flag immunoprecipitation . As shown in Fig . 7G , in the absence of E3 ligases we detected monoUbTNKS1 ( lane 8 ) . RNF166 induced the diUb form ( lane 9 ) . By contrast , DTX1 , 2 , and 4 did not induce additional ubiquitylation , but rather they induced stabilization of the monoUbTNKS1 ( lanes 10 , 11 , and 12 ) . Finally , we tested the remaining two candidate E3 ligases , HUWE1 and TRIP12 , which each contain a WWE PAR - binding domain along with a HECT E3 ligase domain . As shown in Fig . 7H , a slower migrating form of TNKS1 ( consistent with ubiquitylation ) coimmunoprecipitated with HUWE1 ( lane 9 ) , dependent on TNKS catalytic activity ( lane 10 ) . We did not detect an interaction with TRIP12 . Thus , tankyrase interacts with all the E3 ligases ( Fig . 7B ) except TRIP12 , dependent on its catalytic activity . Discussion Tankyrases have a remarkably broad range of interacting partners and cellular functions . Tankyrases exhibit constitutive catalytic activity ; they undergo auto PARylation and PARylate many of their binding partners . The main avenue for regulation of tankyrase protein level is through the PAR - dependent E3 ligase RNF146 , which promotes K48 - linked polyubiquitylation and degradation of PARylated tankyrase and its PARylated partners . Here we describe an antagonist to that degradation . We show that the RING - UIM E3 ligases RNF166 ( and RNF114 ) bind monoUbTNKS to prevent RNF146 mediated K48 - linked polyubiquitylation and degradation and to promote K11 - linked diubiquitylation and TNKS stabilization ( see model Fig . 5C ) . In order to effectively compete with RNF146 , RNF166 must be able to gain access to the RNF146 target ; PARylated tankyrase . However , RNF166 does not contain a known PAR - binding domain and does not bind to other PARylated proteins , such as PARP1 . Nonetheless RNF166 - mediated stabilization and ubiquitylation of tankyrase depends on TNKS catalytic activity . To elucidate the mechanism we characterized the subdomains of RNF166 . We show that the Di19 domain is necessary and sufficient for binding tankyrase and is unaffected by TNKSi . Di19 binding alone does not induce tankyrase level / modification . However , addition of just 17 amino acids ( in the form of the UIM domain ) to Di19 leads to a TNKSi sensitive increase in TNKS protein levels and the appearance of a monoUb species . We hypothesize that TNKS is monoubiquitylated by a PAR - binding E3 ligase , hence the dependence on catalytic activity . We propose that the Di19 and the UIM domains act together as a reader to bind and stabilize monoUbTNKS . Di19 detects some feature of TNKS ( such as a specific amino acid sequence in the SAMPARP domain ) that does not rely on TNKS catalytic activity . Once the Di19 binds , the UIM can then bind to a nearby ubiquitin and block elongation of ubiquitin chains ( Flick et al , 2006 ; Fu et al , 2012 ; 17 McConnell et al , 2010 ) . The RING - C2HC domain could then promote K11 - diubiquitylation of TNKS and ( its partners ) to promote alternative pathways ( Fig . 7I , Model ) . Interestingly , a recent study showed that RNF114 uses its Di19 domain to bind monoADP - ribose in chromatin ( Longarini et al , 2023 ) . Whether the RNF166 / 114 Di19 domain binds to monoADP - ribose on TNKS remains to be determined . Since Di19 binding to tankyrase does not require TNKS catalytic activity , such a mark would not arise from tankyrase - mediated ADP - ribosylation , but it could be conferred on tankyrase by another ADP - ribosyl transferase , such as PARP3 , which was shown previously to interact with TNKS ( Boehler et al , 2011 ) . What is the origin of the monoUb TNKS species that the Di19 - UIM binds to and stabilizes ? In our experiments this species does not require addition of an exogenous E3 ligase . Thus , there may be a low constitutive level of this species in cells that can be stabilized by RNF166 . Mono - and polyubiquitylation of proteins are considered separate steps . The process can use distinct E3s , the same E3s ( with distinct E2s ) , or E2s ( Rodrigo - Brenni & Morgan , 2007 ; Sun & Fang , 2016 ; Windheim et al , 2008 ) . Since , appearance of this species depends on TNKS catalytic activity , the PAR - binding E3 ligase RNF146 is a good candidate to generate monoUbTNKS . However , we found that the Di19UIM could induce monoUb TNKS even in RNF146 KO cells , suggesting that while RNF146 may do so , other E3 ligases may be capable . To date , RNF146 is the only PAR - binding E3 ligase shown to act on tankyrase . We tested six candidate E3s that contained PAR - binding domains . All except one ( TRIP12 ) , bound tankyrase and promoted ubiquitylation dependent on TNKS catalytic activity . CHFR and HUWE1 induced polyUb , similar to RNF146 . Interestingly , the other three ( DTX1 , 2 , and 4 ) did not induce diUb or polyUb , but rather led to stabilization of monoUb TNKS and thus , could be candidates for E3s ligases that monoubiquitylate PARylated TNKS . We showed that RNF166 can compete with RNF146 to prevent degradation of TNKS . There are a number of examples of competing E3 ligases in innate immunity , such as the one described above for RNF5 and RNF26 in the DNA - sensing STING pathway ( Qin et al . , 2014 ) . The RING - E3 ligases can positively and negatively regulate innate signaling pathways through ubiquitylation ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) . In addition to the DNA - sensing STING pathway , there is the RNA sensing RIG - I / MDA5 - MAVS / TRAF3 pathway , and the RNA / DNA sensing Toll Like Receptor ( TLR ) - mediated TRIF / TRAF3 pathway ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) . RNF166 impacts the TRAF3 / TRAF2 pathway ( Chen et al , 2015 ) , and RNF114 and 125 the RIG - I / MDA5 - MAVS pathway ( Arimoto et al , 2007 ; Bijlmakers et al , 2011 ) . Tankyrase has been implicated in these same innate immune response pathways : tankyrase attenuates TLR signaling through RNF146 - mediated degradation of its target 3BP2 ( Matsumoto et al , 2022 ) and inhibits the innate immune antiviral response by PARylating MAVS and promoting its RNF146 - mediated ubiquitylation and degradation ( Xu et al , 2022 ) . Future 18 experiments will determine if there is cross talk / competition between RNF146 , tankyrase , and the RING E3s in innate signaling pathways . We show that RNF166 binds to the SAMPARP domain of TNKS . This is the first example of a TBP that binds SAMPARP and not the ankyrin domain . Such binding offers an opportunity for formation of a ternary complex , as shown for AMOT , TNKS and RNF166 . We showed that in this setting PARylation of AMOT was reduced . RNF166 binding to SAMPARP may limit the ability of TNKS to PARylate a bound TBP , which would limit its interaction with RNF146 . At the same time RNF166 ( by binding and capping the monoUb and by K11 diubiquitylation ) could block elongation of ubiquitin chains . Overall , this could provide an effective counter to RNF146 - mediated degradation of AMOT , resulting in AMOT stabilization . AMOT suppresses the oncogenic function of the transcriptional activator YAP . Tankyrase inhibitors stabilize AMOT and suppress YAP oncogenic functions ( Troilo et al , 2016 ; Wang et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , RNF166 - mediated stabilization of TNKS / AMOT , could potentially suppress the oncogenic function of YAP . We identified a number of TBPs that may be in a ternary complex with RNF166 and TNKS . It will be important to determine if their fate is similar to AMOT . The ability of RNF166 ( and RNF114 ) to stabilize TNKS by blocking degradation , in itself , offers a window of regulation . Additionally , the K11 - linked ubiquitylation may promote new protein - protein interactions and reroute TNKS to other pathways including autophagy , innate immunity , and cell cycle regulation ( Tracz & Bialek , 2021 ) . Our study provides new insights into mechanisms of tankyrase regulation and may offer new uses for tankyrase inhibitors in cancer therapy . 19 Material and Methods Cell lines The following cell lines were supplemented with 10 % DBS and grown in standard conditions : HEK293T ( ATCC ) , U20S ( ATCC ) , TNKS1 / 2 DKO ( Bhardwaj et al . , 2017 ) , HEK293A WT and RNF146 KO ( Nie et al , 2020 ) ( provided by Dr .

The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies ( listed Supplementary Table 2 ) , including anti - TNKS 762 and 763 ( Scherthan et al , 2000 ) , followed by HRP coupled secondary antibodies . The signal was acquired using ECL ( Fisher ) and the ChemiDoc MP imaging system ( Bio - Rad ) . Protein pull - down for mass spectrometry 21 HEK293T cells were seeded in 10 cm dish and transfected the next day using 8 µg of plasmids , and the cells were then subjected to coimmunoprecipitation as described above using the Flag - Beads . After washing the beads with TNE buffer , the proteins bound to the Flag antibodies were eluted using 400 µg / mL of 3xFlag peptide ( Sigma , F4799 ) during 30 min at 4°C under agitation . Eluates were denatured in Laemmli buffer during 5 min at 95°C and submitted for mass spectrometry Mass Spectrometry sample preparation Samples were reduced by DTT during 1 h at 57°C , alkylated with IAA at RT for 45 min and loaded in a NuPAGE® 4 - 12 % Bis - Tris Gel 1 . 0 mm ( Life Technologies ) . After a migration of 20 min at 200 V , bands were stained using GelCode Blue Stain Reagent ( Thermo ) and then destained , excised and dehydrated with 50 % methanol and 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution . The proteins were incubated with acetonitrile and 5 % formic acid , concentrated using SpeedVac , digested overnight at RT with 500 ng of modified trypsin ( Promega ) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate . Peptides were then loaded onto equilibrated microspin Harvard apparatus ( Millipore ) using a microcentrifuge , rinsed three times with 0 . 1 % TFA and eluted with 40 % acetonitrile in 0 . 5 % acetic acid followed by the addition of 80 % acetonitrile in 0 . 5 % acetic acid . The organic solvent was removed using a SpeedVac concentrator and samples were reconstituted in 0 . 5 % acetic acid . Mass spectrometry analysis Ten percent of each sample was individually subjected to a liquid chromatography separation using the autosampler of an EASY - nLC 1200 HPLC ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Peptides were gradient eluted during 1 h using solvent A ( 2 % acetonitrile , 0 . 5 % acetic acid ) and solvent B ( 80 % acetonitrile , 0 . 5 % acetic acid ) into an Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer ( Thermo Scientific ) . High resolution full MS spectra were acquired with a resolution of 120 , 000 , an AGC target of 4e5 , with a maximum ion time of 50 ms , and scan range of 400 to 1500 m / z . All MS / MS spectra were collected using the following instrument parameters : resolution of 30 , 000 , AGC target of 2e5 , maximum ion time of 200 ms , one microscan , 2 m / z isolation window , fixed first mass of 150 m / z , and normalized collision energy ( NCE ) of 27 . Data processing for mass spectrometry MS / MS spectra were searched against a Uniprot human database using Sequest within Proteome Discoverer 2 . 5 . The fold change between two conditions was calculated using the ratio of PSM + 5 for each condition . Potentially relevant proteins were selected for having both fold changes ≥1 . 85 ( shown in green in the supplementary table 1 ) for RNF166 + CTRL vs . BAP + CTRL conditions and for RNF166 + TNKS1 vs . RNF166 + CTRL conditions . 22 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 9 software . Data are shown as mean  SEM .
