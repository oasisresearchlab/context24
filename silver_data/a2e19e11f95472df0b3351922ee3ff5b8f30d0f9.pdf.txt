Pawson , University of Toronto , Toronto , ON , Canada , and approved May 7 , 2007 ( received for review February 6 , 2007 ) Src kinase mediates growth factor signaling and causes oncogenic transformation , which includes dramatic changes in the actin cytoskeleton , cell shape , and motility . Cortactin was discovered as a substrate for Src . How phosphorylation of cortactin can enhance actin assembly is unknown . Here , using an actin assembly system reconstituted from puriﬁed components , we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time a biochemical mechanism by which Src phosphorylation of cortactin affects actin assembly . The adaptor Nck is an important component of the system , linking phosphorylated cortactin with neuronal WASp ( N - WASp ) and WASp - interacting protein ( WIP ) to activate Arp2 / 3 complex . N - WASp (cid:1) Nck (cid:1) tyrosine phosphorylation T he actin cytoskeleton is necessary for cellular migration ( 1 ) , endocytosis ( 2 ) , and cancer cell invasion ( 3 ) . Actin cytoskel - etal reorganization downstream of cellular Src ( c - Src ) plays an important role in growth factor and integrin signaling . c - Src mediates EGF - induced cell migration , cell shape , and actin stress fiber rearrangement ( 4 , 5 ) . Platelet - derived growth factor re - ceptor activation results in actin - rich , circular dorsal ruffle formation , also downstream of Src activity ( 6 ) . Activating mutations in c - Src or infections with the Src - encoding Rous sarcoma virus lead to oncogenic transformation accompanied by dramatic changes in the actin cytoskeleton ( 7 ) . A key feature of Src - transformed fibroblasts is the formation of ventral actin - rich adhesive protrusions ( 8 ) , known as invadopo - dia or podosomes . Invadopodia secrete proteases that degrade local extracellular matrix to facilitate invasion ( 9 ) . Elevated c - Src activity increases invadopodia formation in carcinoma cells ( 10 ) , and elevation in phosphotyrosine levels at invadopodia specifi - cally correlate with increased proteolytic activity ( 11 ) . Invadopodia are composed of actin filaments and a variety of actin assembly regulators ( 10 , 12 , 13 ) . Cortactin is required for the assembly of invadopodia in carcinoma cells ( 10 ) , and it is important for invasion and cell motility in fibrosarcoma cells ( 14 ) . In metastatic carcinoma cells , invadopodia formation also depends on the Arp2 / 3 complex , its activator neuronal WASp ( N - WASp ) , and the adaptor protein Nck1 ( 15 ) . WASp - interacting protein ( WIP ) , an important binding partner of WASp family proteins , is also crucial for invadopodia forma - tion ( 15 ) . Studies of dynamic membrane protrusions in a variety of cell types reveal a crucial role for N - WASp , Nck , cortactin , and WIP in Arp2 / 3 complex - based actin assembly . For example , in breast cancer cells , active N - WASp localizes to the actin nucleation zone of the dynamic leading edge ( 16 ) , and knockdown of N - WASp or Nck2 leads to a decrease in actin polymerization at the leading edge ( 17 ) . Mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking Nck1 / 2 fail to form dorsal ruffles upon platelet - derived growth factor stimulation ( 18 ) . In fibrosarcoma cells , cortactin knock - down leads to a defect in the persistence of lamellipodial protrusions ( 14 ) , and in epithelial cells , the combined expression of cortactin and WIP promotes membrane protrusions ( 19 ) . Biochemical studies of Arp2 / 3 - induced actin assembly reveal a number of functional and physical interactions among cortac - tin , Nck1 , N - WASp , and WIP . Alone , cortactin promotes actin polymerization by simultaneously binding to Arp2 / 3 complex and F - actin , which has the dual effect of activating Arp2 / 3 complex for actin nucleation and stabilizing filament branches created by Arp2 / 3 complex ( 20 ) . N - WASp is a potent activator of Arp2 / 3 complex , and its effect is synergistic with that of cortactin ( 21 ) . In addition , cortactin and Nck bind directly to , and thereby activate , N - WASp ( 22 , 23 ) . Furthermore , WIP binds directly to cortactin , which enhances cortactin’s ability to acti - vate Arp2 / 3 complex ( 19 ) . WIP’s proline - rich region also binds Nck’s SH3 domain ( 24 , 25 ) . In cells , tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is essential for several actin - based processes . Cortactin is tyrosine - phosphorylated downstream of growth factor signaling and Src activity ( 26 ) . In osteoclasts , tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is essential for actin - based podosome formation ( 27 ) . In transmigrating leuko - cytes , cortactin phosphorylation downstream of Src is required for endothelial cell ICAM - 1 clustering and actin remodeling ( 28 ) . In human breast cancer cell lines , cortactin phosphorylation after EGF stimulation enhances cortactin binding to CD2AP , which may facilitate trafficking of endocytosed EGF receptors ( 29 ) . Cortactin phosphorylation is necessary for optimal cadherin - mediated inter - cellular adhesion strength ( 30 ) . Breast cancer cell lines expressing the cortactin mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation induce 74 % fewer osteolytic metastases as compared with cell lines ex - pressing WT cortactin ( 31 ) . Here , we have sought a biochemical mechanism to account for the importance of cortactin phosphorylation downstream of Src in cells . Reconstituting actin assembly with a set of purified components , we find that the phosphorylation of cortactin by Src greatly enhanced Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymeriza - tion . This effect required Nck , and polymerization is enhanced by the addition of N - WASp and WIP . We explored the molecular interactions among the components with mutational analysis . Physical biochemical studies supported the functional assays , and cell biology studies supported the feasibility of this mech - anism in cells .

Supporting information ( SI ) Fig . 4 A illus - trates the domain structures of these proteins and their known interactions ( 19 , 22 , 24 , 25 , 32 ) . We viewed the inclusion of WIP as potentially critical , because in cells , WASp family proteins are often in a complex with WIP ( 33 – 35 ) , and the stability of WASp / N - WASp and WIP appears to depend on their associa - tion ( 36 , 37 ) . In addition , the majority of mutations in WASp that result in the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome occur in the WIP - binding EVH1 domain of WASp ( 32 ) . The adaptor protein Nck1 was included because its SH2 domain binds phosphocortactin strongly ( 38 ) , in addition to the known links of Nck with actin assembly discussed in the Introduction . To study the functional and physical interactions between cortactin , Nck1 , N - WASp , and WIP in vitro , full - length re - combinant proteins were expressed and purified from bacte - rial , insect , and human cells , as described in Materials and Methods . Protein purity was assessed by SDS / PAGE with silver staining ( SI Fig . 4 B ) . Recombinant N - WASp was the limiting reagent in most of our studies , because it was purified from human 293 cells . Dissection of Cortactin Interaction with N - WASp - WIP . We first con - sidered the role of nonphosphorylated cortactin in actin assem - bly in the presence of N - WASp , WIP , and Nck1 ( SI Fig . 5 A ) . The assay included real - time observation of actin polymerization based on the fluorescence of pyrene - labeled actin . Here , the degree of Arp2 / 3 complex activation is proportional to the rate of actin polymerization , and the number of actin filament barbed ends nucleated by Arp2 / 3 complex can be calculated from the slope of the fluorescence versus time plot ( 39 ) . The addition of cortactin to the combination of N - WASp and WIP produced high levels of activation of Arp2 / 3 complex , resulting in 5 - fold higher barbed end generation ( SI Fig . 5 B , lane 8 versus lane 12 ; SI Fig . 5 C ) . We then asked which domains of cortactin were important for its effect on N - WASp and WIP . The W525K mutant form of cortactin , with an inactive SH3 domain ( 19 ) , had no effect when added to the N - WASp - WIP complex ( SI Fig . 5 D , lane 4 versus lane 7 ) . In contrast , the W22A cortactin mutant , which cannot bind Arp2 / 3 complex ( 21 ) , was nearly as effective as WT cortactin ( SI Fig . 5 D , lane 5 versus lane 6 ) . Thus , cortactin appears to interact with N - WASp / WIP via its SH3 domain , and the acidic region of N - WASp is the likely activator of Arp2 / 3 complex . We asked how the combination of N - WASp - WIP and cortac - tin would be affected by the addition of Nck1 . Nck1 addition to N - WASp , WIP , and cortactin increased Arp2 / 3 complex activa - tion ( SI Fig . 5 E , lane 8 versus 9 ) . This was not observed when W22A or W525K cortactin was substituted for WT cortactin , in combination with N - WASp , WIP , and Nck1 ( SI Fig . 5 E , lane 9 versus lanes 10 and 11 ) , suggesting an important role for cortactin in binding Arp2 / 3 complex , N - WASp , and WIP in the presence of Nck1 . Levels of Activation of N - WASp - WIP . Because N - WASp was the likely activator of Arp2 / 3 complex in our assays , we wanted to compare the level of N - WASp activation here with other acti - vators of N - WASp observed in previous studies . N - WASp is autoinhibited , and in previous studies , the combination of PIP 2 and active Cdc42 provided high levels of activation of N - WASp ( 23 ) . Nck1 alone has also been found to activate N - WASp ( 25 ) . We compared the level of Nck1 activation of N - WASp with that of the combination of PIP 2 and active Cdc42 ( SI Fig . 6 A ) . Nck1 activated N - WASp to a higher level than did PIP 2 and Cdc42 ( SI Fig . 6 B , lanes 3 and 4 versus lane 5 ; SI Fig . 6 C ) . We asked whether addition of WIP would lead to a further increase in Arp2 / 3 complex activity . Indeed , the combination of Nck1 , N - WASp , and WIP was a more potent activator of Arp2 / 3 complex than Nck1 and N - WASp ( SI Fig . 6 D , lane 4 versus lane 5 ) . The combination of Nck1 and WIP , without N - WASp , had similar Arp2 / 3 complex activity to that of the negative control ( unpublished data ) . Src - Phosphorylated Cortactin Activates Actin Polymerization in the Presence of Nck1 . We hypothesized that Nck1 may act as an adaptor connecting phosphocortactin with N - WASp or WIP . To test this hypothesis , we included phosphorylation of cortactin as a variable in the reconstitution system . Recombinant cortactin was phosphorylated in vitro with recombinant Src . Immunoblots with a general antiphosphotyrosine antibody and with two antibodies specific for cortactin phosphotyrosines documented that specific tyrosine phosphorylation did occur ( SI Fig . 4 C ) . We carried out additional kinase assays , using adenosine 5 (cid:1) - triphosphate [ (cid:1) - 32 P ] to assess the stoichiometry of cortactin phosphorylation by Src kinase . Stoichiometric calculations re - vealed a 2 : 1 ratio of incorporated [ (cid:1) - 32 P ] ATP : cortactin . As - suming that all three of cortactin’s tyrosines targeted by Src are phosphorylated , then (cid:2) 2 / 3 of cortactin was fully phosphorylated under these reaction conditions . We asked how combinations of phosphocortactin , Nck1 , N - WASp , and WIP would affect Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin poly - merization ( Fig . 1 A ) . First , we found that the combination of Src - phosphorylated cortactin , Nck1 , N - WASp , and WIP acti - vated Arp2 / 3 complex better than did the same combination without phosphorylation of cortactin ( Fig . 1 B , lane 6 versus 7 ; SI Fig . 7 B , curve 6 versus 7 ) . The concentration of barbed ends created was (cid:2) 45 % higher with cortactin phosphorylation . In addition , the combination of the four proteins produced signif - icantly more Arp2 / 3 complex activation than any combination of three proteins ( Fig . 1 B , lane 7 versus lanes 1 – 6 ; SI Fig . 7 B , curve 7 versus curves 1 – 6 ) . To dissect the roles of the multiple potential interactions among the proteins , we next examined the effects of Src - phosphorylation of cortactin in the presence of Nck1 and either N - WASp or WIP . Phosphorylation of cortactin by Src enhanced actin polymerization in the presence of Nck1 and N - WASp , as indicated by faster actin polymerization and up to a 3 - fold increase in barbed end generation ( Fig . 1 C , lane 7 versus lane 8 ; SI Fig . 7 C , curve 6 versus curve 8 ) . An enhancement of actin polymerization was also observed upon Src phosphorylation of cortactin in combination with Nck1 and WIP , without N - WASp ( Fig . 1 C , lane 2 versus lane 3 ; SI Fig . 7 C , curve 2 versus curve 4 ) . Thus , cortactin phosphorylation by Src had a strong and positive effect on Arp2 / 3 complex activation in the presence of Nck1 and either N - WASp or WIP . Cortactin can bind to Arp2 / 3 complex via an N - terminal acidic region with a DDW motif ( 20 ) . To test the importance of this interaction , we used the W22A mutant form of cortactin , which is unable to bind Arp2 / 3 complex ( 21 ) . Phosphorylated W22A cortactin activated actin polymerization as well as phospho - WT cortactin did , in combination with Nck1 and N - WASp , ( Fig . 1 C , lane 8 versus lane 10 ; SI Fig . 7 C , curve 7 versus curve 8 ) . Thus , phosphocortactin’s acidic DDW region is not necessary for Arp2 / 3 complex activation in the presence of Nck1 and N - WASp , suggesting that the C - terminal acidic region of N - WASp plays this role . In addition , the effects of phosphocortactin on actin polymerization in the presence of Nck1 and N - WASp are likely mediated through cortactin domains other than the acidic DDW region . To test this idea further , we replaced N - WASp with WIP in the assay , keeping phosphocortactin and Nck1 . In this context , phosphocortactin’s acidic DDW region is the only potential activator of Arp2 / 3 complex , so one might expect very little actin polymerization upon substituting W22A cortactin for WT cor - tactin in the assay . Indeed , the W22A mutation essentially eliminated Arp2 / 3 complex activation in this setting ( Fig . 1 C , 11934 (cid:1) www . pnas . org (cid:2) cgi (cid:2) doi (cid:2) 10 . 1073 (cid:2) pnas . 0701077104 Tehrani et al . lane 3 versus lane 5 ; SI Fig . 7 C , curve 3 versus curve 4 ) . Thus , the acidic DDW region of phosphocortactin was critical for Arp2 / 3 activation in the absence of N - WASp and the presence of Nck1 and WIP . Cortactin’s SH3 domain is able to bind proline - rich regions of N - WASp or WIP ( 19 , 22 ) . To determine the importance of these potential interactions in the reconstitution , we tested the W525K mutant form of cortactin , which is unable to bind proline - rich sequences ( 19 ) . Phosphorylated W525K cortactin enhanced actin polymerization as efficiently as phospho - WT cortactin did , in the presence of Nck1 and N - WASp ( Fig . 1 D , lane 7 versus lane 9 ; SI Fig . 7 D , curve 8 versus curve 9 ) . Next , we substituted WIP for N - WASp in an assay with the same design . Again , the W525K mutant form of phosphocortactin induced actin polymerization as well as did phospho - WT cortactin ( Fig . 1 D , lane 3 versus lane 5 ; SI Fig . 7 D , curve 4 versus curve 5 ) . Thus , phosphocortactin’s SH3 domain function is dispensable in the presence of Nck1 and either N - WASp or WIP . Effects of Src Phosphorylation on Cortactin Are Mediated by Tyrosines 421 , 466 , and 482 of Cortactin . In cells , cortactin is phosphorylated on tyrosines 421 , 466 , and 482 downstream of Src activity ( 40 ) and Nck1’s SH2 domain can bind phosphocortactin ( 38 ) . We asked whether the enhanced actin polymerization observed with phosphocortactin , Nck1 and N - WASp was mediated by these three tyrosines of cortactin . To answer this question , we used a mutant form of cortactin with Tyr 421 , 466 , and 482 changed to Phe ( 3YF ) ( SI Fig . 8 A ) , which cannot be phosphorylated by Src ( 40 ) . Src had no effect on the 3YF cortactin mutant in the presence of Nck1 and N - WASp , and the activity of this combi - nation was similar to that of WT cortactin , Nck1 , and N - WASp without Src ( Fig . 2 A , lane 7 versus lane 10 ; SI Fig . 8 B , curve 5 versus curve 6 ) . In addition , Src had no effect on the basal activity of Nck1 and N - WASp in the presence of 3YF cortactin ( Fig . 2 A , lane 9 versus lane 10 ; SI Fig . 8 B , curve 4 versus curve 5 ) . We asked whether cortactin’s tyrosines 421 , 466 , and 482 also mediated enhanced Arp2 / 3 activation by phosphocortactin , Nck1 , and WIP ( SI Fig . 8 C ) . Src had no effect on the 3YF cortactin mutant in the presence of Nck1 and WIP , and the activity of this combination was similar to that of WT cortactin , Nck1 , and WIP in the absence of Src ( Fig . 2 B , lane 2 versus lane 5 ; SI Fig . 8 D curve 3 versus curve 4 ) . Src Phosphorylation of Cortactin Augments Cortactin Binding to Nck1 and WIP . Next , we investigated the physical basis of how Src phosphorylation of cortactin enhances Arp2 / 3 activation . In particular , we asked whether phosphorylation increased the amounts of complexes of cortactin , Nck1 , and WIP that can Fig . 1 .

PNAS (cid:1) July 17 , 2007 (cid:1) vol . 104 (cid:1) no . 29 (cid:1) 11935 B I O C H E M I S T R Y form . We tested physical binding and complex formation with surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) . Nonphosphorylated cortac - tin was coupled to flow cell A on an SPR chip , and Src - phosphorylated cortactin was coupled to flow cell B . Various analytes were then flowed over the two cells of the chip concurrently . Nck1 bound to phosphocortactin but not cortactin ( Fig . 3 ) , consistent with the functional assay results . Conversely , WIP bound cortactin and phosphocortactin equally well . This result was also expected because cortactin’s SH3 domain is responsible for binding WIP . We asked whether phosphorylated cortactin could bind WIP and Nck1 simultaneously . Because WIP and Nck1 can also interact with each other , we reasoned that their binding to phosphocortactin might be enhanced . Flowing WIP and Nck1 onto the phosphocortactin flow cell together led to SPR re - sponse unit levels greater than the sum of the levels for Nck1 alone and WIP alone ( Fig . 3 ) , suggesting enhancement in the binding interactions . InVivoExpression , Phosphorylation , andLocalizationofCortactin . We asked whether cortactin , Nck , N - WASp , and WIP are coex - pressed and colocalized in a primary cell type . Osteoclasts were examined because Src and cortactin phosphorylation are critical for cellular function ( 41 ) . RT - PCR with total RNA from cul - tured primary osteoclasts revealed that cortactin , Nck1 / 2 , WIP , and N - WASp were expressed ( SI Fig . 9 A ) . Immunofluorescence staining of osteoclasts revealed colocalization of cortactin , Nck , N - WASp , and WIP to podosomes ( SI Fig . 9 B ) , the dynamic actin - rich structures that resemble invadopodia of cancer cells ( 42 , 43 ) . Next , we asked whether cortactin is phosphorylated on ty - rosines in osteoclasts . The three tyrosines known to be phos - phorylated downstream of Src in other studies are residues 421 , 466 , and 482 of mouse cortactin ( 5 ) . Polyclonal antibodies specific for the phosphotyrosine form of two of these residues have been characterized ( 40 ) . We found that these antibodies recognized endogenous phosphocortactin in osteoclast cell ly - sates by immunoblot , as did a general anti - phosphotyrosine antibody ( SI Fig . 9 C ) . Discussion The effects of Src activity , as part of oncogenic transformation and growth factor signaling , include dramatic increases in dynamic actin assembly . Cortactin is tyrosine - phosphorylated downstream of Src in growth factor signaling ( 40 ) , transfor - mation ( 11 ) , and pathogen invasion ( 44 ) . A key challenge for understanding the biology of Src has been to uncover a biochemical mechanism that might account for the importance of cortactin’s tyrosine phosphorylation downstream of Src . Here , we have discovered a biochemical mechanism that is able to account for Src’s activation of actin assembly by phosphorylation of cortactin . In reconstituted actin assembly assays , cortactin phosphorylation by Src enhanced Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization in the presence of Nck1 , N - WASp , and WIP . Cortactin is a multidomain protein with several potential roles in linking signaling molecules with activators of actin assembly . We investigated the functional significance of cor - tactin’s acidic DDW region , which can bind Arp2 / 3 complex ( 21 ) , and cortactin’s SH3 domain , which can bind N - WASp and WIP , among several proteins ( 19 , 22 ) . We used full - length cortactin containing single amino acid changes , known to have specific defects in these interactions . Both the acidic DDW region and the SH3 domain were important or essential in certain settings but completely dispensable in others ( summa - rized in SI Table 1 ) . One can generalize the results as follows . For the acidic DDW region , when cortactin was the only Arp2 / 3 complex activator present ( i . e . , in the absence of N - WASp ) , the DDW motif was absolutely necessary for Arp2 / 3 activation of actin polymeriza - Fig . 2 .

Physical binding of phosphocortactin , Nck1 , and WIP . ( A ) SPR senso - grams of Nck1 and WIP binding to cortactin and phosphocortactin . Cortactin and phosphocortactin were coupled to different ﬂow cells of one SPR chip . Nck1 and / or WIP were ﬂowed in as analytes . After each association and dissociation cycle , the chip was regenerated ( arrows ) . Vertical lines in senso - grams indicate the change from analyte to buffer . The arrowhead indicates the calculated value of the sum of the response units for Nck1 alone and WIP alone , binding to phosphocortactin . The observed value was consistently higher . 11936 (cid:1) www . pnas . org (cid:2) cgi (cid:2) doi (cid:2) 10 . 1073 (cid:2) pnas . 0701077104 Tehrani et al . tion ( SI Table 1 , lines 1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 ) . The DDW motif was important for Arp2 / 3 complex activation when WIP was present , either in the presence or absence of N - WASp ( SI Table 1 , lines 2 , 5 , 7 , and 8 ) . At the other extreme , the DDW motif was dispensable when WIP was absent and N - WASp was present ( SI Table 1 , lines 3 and 6 ) . The SH3 domain was important for optimal Arp2 / 3 complex activation when Nck1 was absent and N - WASp and WIP were present alone or together ( SI Table 1 , lines 10 , 11 , and 15 ) . This was also the case when Nck1 was present along with both N - WASp and WIP ( SI Table 1 , line 16 ) . On the other hand , when Nck1 was present with either N - WASp alone or WIP alone , the cortactin SH3 domain function was largely dispensable ( SI Table 1 , lines 13 and 14 ) . Considering these results together and in combination with the Src phosphorylation results , one can see that various combinations of domain interactions linking these membrane adaptors and regulators in different ways may suffice to activate Arp2 / 3 complex . In addition to having a positive influence on actin polymer - ization , cortactin phosphorylation downstream of Src may enhance cortactin’s ability to act as an adaptor or negatively regulate cortactin function . In cells , cortactin’s ability to bind proline - rich binding partners ( including CD2AP and myosin light chain kinase ) is enhanced upon phosphorylation of cortactin ( 29 , 45 ) . Biochemically , cortactin’s ability to activate N - WASp in vitro is enhanced by Erk phosphorylation of Ser 405 and 418 of cortactin ( 46 ) . However , the effects of Erk phosphorylation on cortactin are negatively regulated by Src phosphorylation of cortactin ( 46 ) . The difference between the Erk - Src phosphorylation data and our data may be explained by the absence and presence of Nck , respectively . Our results provide a biochemical model that may help to explain these and other cases of actin polymerization at membranes . One possible scenario is that Nck , N - WASp , WIP , and cortactin are recruited to a membrane site in response to Src activation , creating a highly potent activator for Arp2 / 3 complex . Certain subsets of the four proteins may also be sufficient , and the composition of the activating complex may change over time . As actin polymerization proceeds at the membrane , cortactin may stabilize filament branch points and move away from the membrane with the growing actin filament network , whereas N - WASp , WIP , and Nck remain at the membrane . Materials and Methods Protein Purification . Arp2 / 3 complex was purified from bovine thymus as described in ref . 39 . Actin was purified from porcine muscle and gel - filtered as described in ref . 47 . Human Cdc42 cDNA [ American Type Culture Collection ] was used as a template for QuikChange site - directed mutagenesis ( Strat - agene , La Jolla , CA ) to mutate G12 to V . The insert was cloned into pDEST15 vector ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . WT full - length human Nck1 was also cloned into pDEST15 . GST - tagged VCA , Cdc42 , Nck1 , and cortactin were expressed in BL21star E . coli ( Invitrogen ) and purified by using glutathi - one - Sepharose 4B beads ( Amersham Biosciences , Piscataway , NJ ) . GST - cortactin was further purified as described ( 48 ) , including a TEV protease ( Invitrogen ) cleavage step to remove the GST tag . GST - viral cap antigen was further purified as described in ref . 49 . Recombinant WIP was purified as described in ref . 50 , with substitution of a MonoS column for the gel filtration column . Recombinant TAP - tagged N - WASp was produced by using the Freestyle 293 expression system ( Invitrogen ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , suspension Freestyle 293 - FS cells were grown in defined serum - free media in shaker flasks at 37°C with 8 % CO 2 . Cells were transfected on a 1 . 2 - liter scale with 1 . 2 mg of DNA and 1 . 6 ml of 293Fectin at a cell density of 1 . 1 (cid:3) 10 6 / ml . Forty - eight hours later , cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1 , 000 (cid:3) g for 15 min and frozen on liquid nitrogen . Later , the cells were lysed on ice for 30 min with lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 / 1 mM EDTA / 1 mM EGTA / 10 % glycerol / 150 mM NaCl / 1 % Nonident P - 40 / 0 . 125 % deoxycholate / 1 mM PMSF / 1 mM sodium orthovanadate / 1 mM NaF / 20 mM (cid:2) - glycerophosphate ) . Lysates were centrifuged at 163 , 000 (cid:3) g for 13 min at 4°C , and TAP - N - WASP was purified from the supernatant as described in ref . 51 . A silver stain - ing kit ( Amersham Biosciences ) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol for assessment of protein purity . In Vitro Phosphorylation of Cortactin . Recombinant human Src expressed and purified from Sf9 cells was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology ( Lake Placid , NY ) and used for in vitro phosphorylation of cortactin . Cortactin ( 2 (cid:3) M ) was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 75 units of Src in 200 (cid:3) l of reaction buffer . The reaction buffer included 100 mM Tris (cid:1) HCl pH 7 . 2 , 125 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA , 2 . 5 mM ATP , 0 . 25 mM sodium orthovanadate , 1 mM NaF , 2 mM DTT , and protease inhibitors ( 1 (cid:3) g / ml pepstatin A / 0 . 1 mM PMSF / 10 (cid:3) M leupep - tin ) . For experiments that included nonphosphorylated cor - tactin , mock reactions were set up as above but without the addition of recombinant Src . To assess the stoichiometry of cortactin phosphorylation by Src , the above kinase reaction was carried out with the addition of 10 (cid:3) Ci ( 1 Ci (cid:4) 37 GBq ) of adenosine 5 (cid:1) - triphosphate [ (cid:1) - 32 P ] ( Perkin – Elmer , Downers Grove , IL ) followed by gel electrophoresis . The radioactively labeled cortactin band was excised , and the amount of radio - activity was assessed by a scintillation counter . Pyrene - Labeled Actin Assembly Assay . Pyrene - actin polymeriza - tion assays were performed as described in ref . 19 . All actin polymerization assays included 2 . 5 (cid:3) M actin and 100 nM Arp2 / 3 , and various assays included 0 . 1 nM N - WASp , 50 nM WIP , 200 nM Nck1 , 100 nM cortactin , 10 (cid:3) M PIP 2 in PC / PS vesicles , and 500 nM Cdc42 ( unless otherwise stated ) . GST - viral cap antigen ( 250 nM ) was included as a positive control for maximal Arp2 / 3 activation . Actin filament barbed end calculations were performed as described ( 39 ) . Standard er - rors of the mean ( SEM ) were calculated from standard deviations and sample numbers ( 3 or more ) in each condition . The quantity of recombinant N - WASp available was a limiting factor in assays with N - WASp . The average barbed end concentration generated in assays using the positive control for Arp2 / 3 complex ( GST - viral cap antigen ) was 28 . 7 (cid:5) 4 . 8 nM ( n (cid:4) 8 ; standard error of the mean ) . SPR Analysis . Solutions of cortactin and phosphocortactin ( 30 (cid:3) g / ml ) in immobilization buffer ( 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5 . 0 ) were used to couple (cid:2) 2 , 000 response units to CM5 SPR chips ( BIAcore , Uppsala , Sweden ) via amine coupling . The amine coupling kit ( BIAcore ) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The polymerization buffer used in actin assembly assays served as the buffer for carrying analyte and washing . The chips were regenerated after each experiment with 10 mM glycine (cid:1) HCl , pH 2 . 2 at 20 (cid:3) l / min for 1 min . We thank Drs .
