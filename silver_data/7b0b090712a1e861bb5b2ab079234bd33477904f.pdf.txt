Ezrin Has a COOH - Terminal Actin - binding Site That Is Conserved in the Ezrin Protein Family Ossi Turunen , * Torsten Wahlstr6m , * and Antti Vaheri * Haartman Institute , * Department of Virology , and * Department of Pathology , POB 21 , FIN - 00014 Helsinki University , Finland Abstract . Ezrin , previously also known as cytovillin , p81 , and 80K , is a cytoplasmic protein enriched in microvilli and other cell surface structures . Ezrin is postulated to have a membrane - cytoskeleton linker role . Recent findings have also revealed that the NH : - terminal domain of ezrin is associated with the plasma membrane and the COOH - terminal domain with the cytoskeleton ( Algrain , M . , O . Turunen , A . Vaheri , D . Louvard , and M . Arpin . 1993 . J . Cell Biol . 120 : 129 - 139 ) . Using bacterially expressed fragments of ezrin we now demonstrate that ezrin has an actin - binding capability . We used glutathione - S - transferase fusion proteins of truncated ezrin in affinity chroma - tography to bind actin from the cell extract or purified rabbit muscle actin . We detected a binding site for filamentous actin that was localized to the COOH - terminal 34 amino acids of ezrin . No binding of monomeric actin was detected in the assay . The region corresponding to the COOH - terminal actin - binding site in ezrin is highly conserved in moesin , actin - capping protein radixin and EM10 protein of E . mul - tilocularis , but not in merlin / schwannomin . Conse - quently , this site is a potential actin - binding site also in the other members of the protein family . Further - more , the actin - binding site in ezrin shows sequence homology to the actin - binding site in the COOH ter - minus of the B subunit of the actin - capping protein CapZ and one of the potential actin - binding sites in myosin heavy chain . The actin - binding capability of ezrin supports its proposed role as a membrane - cytoskeleton linker . T HE ezrin protein family ( also called ERM family ; Sato et al . , 1992 ) has potentially an important role at the cortical cytoskeleton and may participate in the regulation of several cellular functions ( see a recent review by Arpin et al . , 1994 ) . Indirect evidence shows that members of the ezrin protein family interact with membranes and cytoskeleton , but more data are needed on the components binding directly to ezrin and other proteins of the family and how these associations are regulated . Here our focus is on the cytoskeletal interactions of ezrin , the prototype protein of the family . Ezrin is a widely distributed protein located in microvilli and other cell surface structures ( Bretscher , 1983 ; Gould et al . , 1986 ; Pakkanen et al . , 1987 ; 1988 ; Pakkanen , 1988 ; Hanzel et al . , 1989 ; Berryman et al . 1993 ; Franck et al . , 1993 ) . Based on the homologies in amino acid sequence ( Turunen et al . , 1989 ; Gould et al . , 1989 ) with other cytoskeletal proteins , it has been suggested that ezrin links the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane . The NH2 - termi - hal domain of ezrin ( 200 - 300 amino acids ; see Fig . 1 , do - main EzN ) shows 37 % identity to erythrocyte protein band 4 . 1 ( Conboy et al . , 1986 ) and 23 % identity to talin ( Rees et Address all correspondence to Dr . Ossi Turunen , Haartman Institute , Department of Virology , POB 21 , FIN - 00014 Helsinki University , Finland . Telephone : 358 - 0 - 434 - 6486 ; FAX : 358 - 0 - 434 - 6491 . al . , 1990 ) . Both protein 4 . 1 and talin are linker proteins at the cortical cytoskeleton . The NH2 - terminal domain of pro - tein 4 . 1 has been shown to be responsible for the binding to membrane proteins and the central 10 - kD domain to spectrin ( for reviews see Bennett , 1989 ; Bretscher , 1991 ; Luna and Hitt , 1992 ) . A similar functional structure of ezrin has ap - peared when the domains of ezrin have been expressed in cells . Accordingly , in ezrin the NH2 - terminal domain is localized to membranes and the COOH - terminal part con - talning the a - helical domain colocalizes with actin filaments ( Algrain et al . , 1993 ) . Further evidence for the association of ezrin with cytoskeleton comes from several reports that ezrin is associated with the cytoskeleton in cell fractionation experiments , in which ezrin has been found in the detergent - insoluble fraction containing the cytoskeleton ( Bretscher , 1983 ; Hanzel et al . , 1991 ; Egerton et al . , 1992 ; Algrain et al . , 1993 ) . No specific binding ligand in the membranes or in the cytoskeleton has been reported thus far for ezrin . Recently , several proteins have been identified that share a strikingly high identity to ezrin . Radixin ( Funayama et al . , 1991 ) , moesin ( Lankes and Furtlunayr , 1991 ) , merlin / schwan - nomin ( Rouleau et al . , 1993 ; Trofatter et al . , 1993 ) , and EM10 protein ofEchinococcus multilocularis ( Frosch et al . , 1991 ) are 75 , 73 , 48 , and 43 % identical to ezrin , respectively . Although it is possible that the whole ezrin protein family functions as a membrane - cytoskeleton linker , only radixin © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 94 / 09 / 1445 / 09 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 126 , Number 6 , September 1994 1445 - 1453 1445 has been reported to be an actin - binding protein ( Tsukita et al . , 1989 ) . Extensive attempts using sedimentation , affinity - chromatographic and overlay assays to show direct interac - tion of ezrin with actin or other proteins have been unsuc - cessful ( Bretscher , 1983 ; 1991 ; Krieg and Hunter , 1992 ; Fazioli et al . , 1993 ) . A weak interaction of ezrin with actin was detected in sedimentation assays , but the binding was not seen in physiological salt concentrations ( Bretscher , 1983 , 1991 ) . A direct binding of ezrin to the closely related moesin has been detected recently by immtmoprecipitation and over - lay assays ( Gary and Bretscher , 1993 ) , but the physiological meaning of this association is not yet known . Using bacterially expressed truncated ezrin constructs we now demonstrate that actin in cell extracts and purified mus - cle actin bind to ezrin . In our procedure we expressed over - lapping parts of ezrin as fusion proteins with glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) ~ . Ezrin fusion proteins were used in affinity chromatography to identify proteins binding to ez - rin . Actin was the only major protein that could be shown to bind to ezrin . Materials and Methods Antisera Polyclonal antibody I : a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against human ezrin ( cytovillin ) was described by Pakkanen ( 1988 ) . We also raised mono - clonal antibodies against human ezrin using the COOH - terminal part of ez - rin in immunizins mice ( Turunen , O . , T . Wahlstrtm , O . Carl ~ n , E . - M . Salonen , and A . Vaheri , manuscript in preparation ) . The amino acid region 362 - 585 was cloned as a Pst I fragment pCV1 clone ( Turunen et al . , 1989 ) to pEXI vector for the expression in bacteria . One of the resulting monoclo - hal antibodies ( CVP1 ) was used in characterization of the GST - ezrin fusion proteins expressed from pGEX vectors . Folyclonal antibody II : rabbit an - tiserum raised against human ezrin was a kind gift from Dr . A . Bretscher ( Coruell University , Ithaca , NY ) . The monoclonal mouse anti - ezrin anti - body 7 _ , 036 , raised against a synthetic peptide comprising the region 575 - 585 of human ezrin , was purchased from Zymed Labs . ( San Francisco , CA ) , the monoclonal antibodies to actin from Sigma Chem . Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) , and the monoclonal antibodies to / 5 - galactosidase from Promega ( Madison , WI ) . Creation and Expression of Truncated Fusion Proteins A series of truncated ezrin - fusion proteins ( see Fig . 1 ) were expressed as GST fusion proteins from pGEX vectors ( Pbarmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) . Subclones of the COOH - terminal part of ezrin were produced by PCR using ezrin cDNA clone pCV6 ( Turunen et al . , 1989 ) as the template . Barn H1 sites were constructed at both ends of the PCR clones for the subcloning in the pGEX - 3X expression vector . The NH2 - terminal fusion protein FP 1 - 308 was created by subcloning the pCV6 insert to the pGEX - 1XT vector and removing the DNA fragment Sma I - Nru I ( cuts at pCV6 bases 1003 and 2049 , respectively ) . The starting site for the protein coding of ezrin was regarded as the same as that reported by Gould et al . ( 1989 ) and Franck et al . ( 1993 ) . The FP 1 - 308 fusion protein contained 26 additional amino acids coming from the 5 ' - noncoding region of the pC " ¢6 clone . FP 243 - 585 was created by expressing the ezrin pLAt1 clone ( containing amino acids 243 - 585 ) with EcoRI sites at the ends of the clone ( Turunen et al . , 1989 ) in the pGEX - lhT vector . The clones ending in the ezrin residue 585 used the stop codon of ezrin eDNA . The stop codon for the clone FP 1 - 308 was formed from the non - coding region of ezrin cDNA , thus adding 15 amino acids to the carboxy terminus of FP 1 - 308 protein : AIILESPPVLCWEQD . The clones FP 279 - 485 , FP 279 - 531 , and EP 477 - 579 used the stop codons of the pGEX vector ; consequently they all contained 6 - 15 COOH - terminal amino acids expressed from the vector ( the additional amino acids at the COOH terminus ofezrin were : FP 279 - 485 , DPREFIVTD ; FP 279 - 531 and FP 477 - 531 , RIPGNSS ; FP 477 - 579 , GSPGIHRD ) . The correct sequence of the clone FP 552 - 585 was confirmed by sequencing with Sequenase 2 . 0 1 . Abbreviations used in this paper : GST , glutathione - S - transferase . ( Un . States Biochemicals , Cleveland , OH ) . The correct expression of all clones except FP 1 - 308 was confirmed by a positive reaction with antibodies specific to ezrin . The fusion proteins were produced and purified using basically the method of Smith and Johnson ( 1988 ) . Escherichia coli DH5 cells were used as the host in protein expression . The synthesis of the fusion proteins was induced by incubating the bacteria with 1 . 0 mM isopropyl / 5 - v - thiogalacto - pyranoside ( IPTG ) for 1 - 5 h at 30°C . The cells were sedimented by centrifu - gation and the cell pellet was then solubilized in buffer A ( 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7 . 4 / 0 . 165 M NaCI / 1 . 0 mM MgCI2 / 0 . 2 mM ATP / 0 . 2 mM DTT / I % Triton X - 100 / 1 . 0 mM PMSF ) . After sonication , the cell debris was removed by centrifugation ( 10 , 000 g , 10 min ) and the supernatant was filtered through a MilLipore 0 . 45 ~ tm filter . The supernatant was applied to Glutathione - Sepharose 4B beads ( Pharmacia ) to purify the fusion proteins . Glutathione - Sepharose 4B beads were washed with buffer A before incu - bation with bacterial lysate . The fusion proteins were bound from bacterial lysate to Glutathione - Sepharose beads by incubating for a minimum of 10 rain with end - over shaking at room temperature . The Glutathione - Sepbarose beads containing the fusion protein were washed with buffer A to remove unbound bacterial proteins . Since the fusion protein FP 1 - 308 was insoluble in E . coli cells , it was purified by preparative SDS - PAGE . After staining with ice - cold 0 . 9 M potassium acetate , the corresponding gel slice was cut out from the gel and the protein was electroeluted from the gel slice in a buffer containing 100 raM glycine and 30 raM Tris / HCl pH 8 . 0 . After dialysis against buffer A , the FP 1 - 308 protein was purified by Giutathione - Sepharose 4B beads . Preparation of psSMethionine - labeled Cell Lysate and Incubation with GST - Ezrin - Sepharose Beads JEG - 3 choriocarcinoma cells ( Amer . Type Culture Collection , Rockville , MD ; HTB 36 ) were labeled overnight with 35Smethionine ( 30 # Ci / ml ) in methionine - frec MEM supplemented with 2 % FCS . The cells were washed with PBS and collected on ice in buffer A . After sonication , the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10 , 000 g ( 10 rain ) and the cell lysate was filtered through a Millipore 0 . 45 ~ tm filter . The cell lysate was incubated for a minimum of 15 rain with GST - ezrin - Sepharose beads using shaking at room temperature . In the binding experi - ments ' ~ 5 - 50 / d of 50 % Sepharose slurry containing , , ol - 20 ~ g of fusion protein was incubated with cell extract obtained from a third to fifth part of a confluent 100 - mm Petri dish . The total volume in the binding experi - ment was 0 . 5 - 1 . 0 nil . Before analyzing the proteins bound to GST - ezrin - Sepharose beads , unbound proteins were removed by washing several times with buffer A , more than ten times the bed volume . The GST - ezrin Sepharose beads containing the bound cellular material and the control GST - Sepharose beads were applied directly in SDS - PAGE . Effect of NaCl and SDS on the Binding of Actin to GST - Ezrin The effect of NaCl on binding of 35Smethionine - labeled cellular actin to ezrin is shown for FP 477 - 585 . Concentrations of NaC1 were varied in buffer A : 0 . 15 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 8 , and 1 . 0 M . The binding of actin to GST - ezrin - Sepharose beads and the washing of the beads after binding were accomplished in the corresponding NaCl concentration . We also tested the binding of actin to GST - ezrin fusion proteins in the low salt concentration of buffer B ( 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7 . 4 / 0 . 2 mM CaCl2 / 0 . 2 mM ATP / 0 . 2 mM DTT / I % Triton X - 100 / I . 0 mM PMSF ) . The sodium concentration in buffer B was 10 raM . For the monomer binding assay , 35Smethionine - labeled JEG - 3 cells were washed with PBS , and then rapidly once with buffer B without detergent . The cells were directly suspended in buffer B and prepared for the binding assay as described above . The binding of actin to GST - ezrin was also tested with 0 . 01 % and 0 . 1 % SDS added to binding experiment in buffer A . Binding of Purified Muscle Actin to GST - Ezrin Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared according to the method of Spudich and Watt ( 1971 ) . Purified actin ( 2 / ~ g as a single band in SDS - PAGE ) was stored on ice in G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris - HC1 pH 7 . 5 / 0 . 2 mM CAC12 / 0 . 2 mM ATP / 0 . 5 mM ~ - mercaptoethanol ) . Actin was polymerized during 30 min in buffer A ( without PMSF ) and incubated at the concentra - tion of 1 . 0 mg / ml for 30 rain in buffer A ( without PMSF ) with FP 243 - 585 Sepharose 4B beads or GST - Sepharose 4B beads in a total volume of 200 f , l . The concentration of FP 243 - 585 was , , 040 ttg / ml . As a negative control The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 126 , 1994 1446 EzN Eza EzC FP 1 - 308 I .

A . Bretscher ; nd , not determined . The ac - tin - binding COOH - terminal be phosphorylated are shown . we used the GST - Sepharose 413 beads at the GST concentration of " , 200 # g / ml . After washing several times by the binding buffer the beads were analyzed in SDS - PAGE . It was important to polymerize the actin before adding to GST - ezrin - Sepharose beads or control GST - Sepharose beads . Otherwise actin was polymerized inside the porous structures of Sepharose beads and consequently remained bound to the beads . Binding of purified muscle actin was tested also in monomer actin buffer conditions ( buffer B ) in actin concentration of 1 . 0 mg / ml . We used both fila - ment free G - actin and a G - actin preparation containing actin filaments : after polymerization with 150 mM KCI and 1 . 0 mM MgC12 , the actin was dia - lyzed two days against G - buffer and was not ultracentrifugated to remove the remaining filaments . Analysis of Proteins Bound to GST - Ezrin - Sepharose Beads SDS - PAGE was used to identify the proteins bound to the GST - ezrin - Sepharose beads . The proteins in the gel were detected by autoradiography or by immunoblotting with monoclonal actin antibody in a dilution of 1 " 2 , 500 . An estimation of the amounts of fusion proteins in the binding ex - periments was obtained by staining the immunoblot filter with 0 . 2 % Pon - ceau red in 3 % TCA or by Coomassie blue staining of the gels . The binding of purified muscle actin to FP 243 - 585 Sepharose beads was detected by Coomassie blue staining of the SDS - PAGE gel or by immunoblotting with actin antibody . Results General Strategy to Detect Proteins Interacting with Ezrin We have here used affinity chromatography to identify pro - teins binding to ezrin . The truncated forms of ezrin were ex - pressed as fusion proteins with GST in pGEX expression system ( Smith and Johnson , 1988 ) . GST fusion proteins were purified by using the affinity of GST to glutathione cou - pled to Sepharose 4B beads . We used GST - ezrin fusion pro - teins immobilized on Glutathione - Sepharose 4B beads in affinity chromatography to detect which proteins in cell ly - sate bind to GST - ezrin ( " GST - ezrin " is used to refer to all the different truncated ezrin clones created as fusion proteins with GST ) . The advantages of this method are that no chemi - cal coupling reagents are used and the orientation of the GST - ezrin on the Sepharose beads is known . While the fu - sion protein is bound to the Sepharose beads by the GST - part , the COOH terminus of ezrin is uniformly oriented away from the matrix and is free to interact with other proteins . Analysis of the Bacterial Expression Products A series of truncated GST - ezrin fusion proteins ( Fig . 1 ) covering the whole coding sequence of ezrin was created from ezrin eDNA . Full - length GST - ezrin could not , how - ever , be purified for the actin - binding assay since the expres - sion level was very low and the fusion protein was insoluble . To see whether the fusion proteins were fully expressed , the observed sizes in SDS - PAGE were compared to the sizes cal - culated on the basis of sequence data . The theoretical sizes of the truncated expression products of ezrin were added to the size of GST protein ( 27 kD ) . The observed sizes in SDS - PAGE compared to expected values ( in parenthesis ) were as follows : FP 1 - 308 , 67 kD ( 65 kD ) ; FP 243 - 585 , 80 kD ( 68 kD ) ; FP 279 - 531 , 71 kD ( 58 kD ) ; FP 279 - 485 , 59 kD ( 53 kD ) ; FP 47 % 585 , 42 kD ( 40 kD ) ; FP 47 % 531 , 37 kD ( 34 kD ) ; FP 47 % 579 , 42 kD ( 40 kD ) ; FP 507 - 585 , 35 kD ( 37 kD ) ; FP 552 - 585 , 31 kD ( 31 kD ) . The comparison of the observed and estimated sizes indicated that all fusion proteins were ex - pressed in full length . All the GST - ezrin fusion proteins were expressed close to the expected sizes , except the clones con - raining the heptaproline region ( FP 243 - 585 , FP 279 - 485 , FP 279 - 531 ; Fig . 1 ) . Their observed sizes were , , o6 - 13 kD higher than the calculated values . Several antibodies raised against ezrin were used in immu - noblotting to confirm the correct expression of the truncated fusion proteins ( Fig . 2 ) . All the GST - ezrjn fusion proteins , except FP 1 - 308 , were detected by one or more of the ezrin antibodies . The immunoblotting analyses also identified the location of the sites detected by different antibodies . The polyclonal antibody I ( PAb I ) raised against the full - length cellular ezrin reacted predominantly with the region contain - ing the predicted a - helical domain Ez , and the heptaproline sequence ( Fig . 2 , lanes 3 and 4 ) . The reaction was weaker against the COOH - terminal domain EzC ( Fig . 2 , lanes 6 - 8 ) and PAb I did not react at all with the NH2 - terminal domain EzN ( Fig . 2 , Lane / ) . The polyclonal ezrin antibodies pre - pared by Dr . A . Bretscher ( PAb ID gave a similar staining pattern except that they reacted with the COOH - terminal epitopes stronger than PAb I ( Fig . 2 , lanes 5 - 8 ) and detected a larger COOH - terminal region . As a result , PAb II detected the region 47 % 531 and possibly also the region 552 - 585 , while PAb I did not detect the regions 47 % 531 and 552 - 585 Turunen et al . Actin - binding Site of Ezrin 1447 Figure 3 . Binding of cellular actin to GST - ezrin - Sepharose beads . ( A ) A 45 - kD protein was bound to the FP 243 - 585 fusion protein ( lane 1 ) and FP 477 - 585 fusion protein 0ane 2 ) immobilized on Glutathione - Sepharose 4B beads when cell lysate from JEG - 3 choriocarcinoma cells labeled with l ~ SS ] methionine was incubated with GST - ezrin - Sepharose beads . The 45 - kD protein did not bind to FP 477 - 579 Sepharose beads ( lane 3 ) . In this experiment the Triton - X - 100 was omitted from the buffer A . The proteins bound to GST - ezrin - Sepharose beads were detected using autoradiogra - phy . ( B ) The 45 - kD protein bound to GST - ezrin - Sepharose beads was identified in immtmoblotting using a monoelonal antibody to actin in a dilution of 1 : 2 , 500 . The immunoblot shows the aetin - binding experiments using GST - protein ( lane 1 ) , FP 243 - 585 fu - sion protein ( lane 2 ) , and FP 477 - 585 fusion protein ( lane 3 ) im - mobilized on Glutathione - Sepharose 4B beads . As antibody control the material bound to FP 243 - 585 Sepharose beads was stained with monoclonal antibody to 15 - galaetosidase in a dilution of 1 : 2 , 500 ( lane 4 ) . Figure 2 . Immunoblotting of the GST - ezrin fusion proteins . The E . coli bacterial pellet was solubilized in Laemmli ' s sample buffer and immunoblotted using polyclonal antibody I ( PAb I ) in a dilution of 1 : 2 , 000 , polyclonal antibody II ( PAb / / ) in a dilution of 1 : 2 , 000 , monoclonal antibody CVP1 in a dilution of 1 : 2 , 000 , and monoclo - nal antibody Z036 in a dilution of 1 : 5 , 000 . ( Fig . 2 , lanes 5 and 9 , respectively ) . The epitope detected by monoclonal antibody CVP1 is located at the site 532 - 558 , since it detected FP 477 - 579 ( Fig . 2 , lane 8 ) and FP 477 - 558 ( not shown ) , but not FP 279 - 531 and FP 477 - 531 ( Fig . 2 , lanes 3 and 5 , respectively ) . CVP1 is specific to human ezrin ( our unpublished data ) . Since the only differences between mouse and human ezrins in the region 532 - 558 or close to it are at the sites Val - 531 ( Leu - 532 in mouse ezrin ) and Ser - 535 ( Ash - 536 in mouse ezrin ) ( see Fig . 8 ` 4 ) , the epitope rec - ognized by CVP1 is concluded to include residue 531 and / or residue 535 . The monoclonal antibody Z036 is raised by Dr . A . Bretscher against a synthetic peptide comprising the re - gion 575 - 585 . Immunoblotting with Z036 showed that all the fusion proteins ending in the COOH terminus ( FP 243 - 585 , FP 477 - 585 , FP 507 - 585 , and FP 552 - 585 ) contained an in - tact epitope detected by the Z036 monoclonal antibody . Binding of Actin to GST - Ezrin - Sepharose 4B Beads The major protein binding to GST - ezrin - Sepharose 4B beads from [ 35S ] methionine - labeled JEG - 3 choriocarcinoma cell lysate in buffer A had the size of 45 kD in SDS - PAGE ( Fig . 3 , 4 , lanes I and 2 ) . There were also some unidentified pro - teins ( molecular mass region 70 - 200 kD ) binding in very low amounts to the Eza domain ( FP 243 - 585 ; Fig . 3 A , lane / ) but not to the EzC domain ( FP 477 - 585 ; Fig . 3 A , lane 2 ) . In immunoblotting , the 45 - kD protein binding to FP 243 - 585 and FP 47 % 585 Sepharose beads was found to be actin ( Fig . 3 B , lanes 2 and 3 , respectively ) and had the same size as cellular actin ( not shown ) . As antibody control , the cellu - lar material bound to FP 243 - 585 Sepharose beads ( Fig . 3 B , lane 4 ) was stained with monoclonal antibody to / 3 - galac - tosidase . Actin did not bind to the GST - Sepharose control beads ( Fig . 3 B , lane / ) . Occasionally very weak binding to control beads was observed , but the amount of binding was insignificant ( an example is seen in Fig . 4 , lane 8 ) when com - pared to the specific actin binding . In our actin - binding assay we normally used 1 % Triton X - 100 . However , actin was bound to truncated ezrin simi - larly in the absence ( Fig . 3 A , lanes 1 and 2 ) or presence ( Fig . 4 , lane 4 ) of the nonionic detergent . The independence of the use of the nonionic detergent Triton X - 100 indicates that hydrophobic interactions do not have a major role in the binding of actin to GST - ezrin . To see whether ezrin binds also to monomeric actin , we tested the binding of actin to GST - ezrin in the low salt buffer ( buffer B ) that keeps the actin in monomeric form . In this experiment the actin in [ asS ] methionine - labeled cell lysate did not bind to GST - ezrin ( FP 243 - 585 and FP 477 - 585 ) in The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 126 , 1994 1448 Figure 4 . The influence of NaCI and SDS on the actin - binding of the COOH - terminal domain of ezrin ( FP 47 % 585 ) . [ 35S ] Methio - nine - labeled JEG - 3 cell extract was used as the source for actin . When JEG - 3 ceils were solubilized in buffer B ( G - buffer ) , actin did not bind to FP 243 - 585 Sepharose beads ( lane 2 ) or FP 477 - 585 Sepharose beads ( lane 3 ) . Lane 1 shows the GST control experi - ment in buffer B . In lanes 4 - 7the influence of higher concentrations of NaCI were tested on the actin binding of FP 477 - 585 . The [ 35S ] methionine - labeled JEG - 3 cell lysate was prepared in buffer A containing 0 . 165 M NaC1 ( lane 4 ) , 0 . 5 M NaCI ( lane 5 ) , 0 . 8 M NaCI ( lane 6 ) , and 1 . 0 M NaCI ( lane 7 ) . Lane 8 shows the experi - ment with GST - Sepharose control beads in 0 . 165 M NaC1 . The influence of SDS on the actin binding of FP 477 - 585 was tested in buffer A with 0 . 01 % SDS ( lane 9 ) or 0 . 1 % SDS ( lane 10 ) . 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer ( Fig . 4 , lanes 2 and 3 , respectively ) . This shows that monomeric actin did not bind to GST - ezrin ( region 243 - 585 ) . The negative result in the low salt buffer was not due to the absence of actin in the cell lysate made in buffer B , as confirmed by immunoblotting ( not shown ) . The GST - ezrin fusion proteins could be easily eluted by 15 mM glutathione from the Glutathione - Sepharose beads except the fusion protein FP 243 - 585 . However , we could not use the glutathione elution to test whether actin binds specifically to GST - ezrin , since the actin was partially washed away from the beads also with the buffer only ( not shown ) . Probably the washings broke the actin filaments on the beads , but also a potentially low affinity binding of actin to GST - ezrin could explain the elution of actin by binding buffer ( buffer A ) . In the experiments with [ 35S ] methionlne - labeled cell ly - sate , a few proteins were binding in small amounts ( com - pared to actin ) to GST - ezrin - Sepharose beads , but not to the GST - Sepharose control beads . An example is a 36 - kD pro - tein that bound to the GST - ezrin - Sepharose beads ( Fig . 3 A , lanes 1 and 2 ; Fig . 4 , lane 4 ) but not to the control beads ( Fig . 3 A , lane 3 ; Fig . 4 , lane 8 ) . However , a concentration of 0 . 5 - 1 . 0 M NaCl in the binding buffer ( Fig . 4 , lanes 5 - 7 ) or 0 . 1 % SDS ( Fig . 4 , lane 10 ) removed the minor proteins ; an upper minor protein appearing in high salt experiments ( Fig . 4 , lanes 5 - 7 ) was occasionally detected . Concen - trations of 0 . 5 - 1 . 0 M NaCl or 0 . 1 % SDS did not prevent the binding of GST - ezrin fusion protein to Glutathione - Sepharose beads as assayed by Coomassie blue staining of Figure 5 . Binding of purified rabbit muscle actin to GST - ezrin Sepharose beads . F - actin was incubated in buffer A with GST - Sepharose beads ( lane 1 ) and FP 243 - 585 Sepharose beads ( lane 2 ) . Lanes 1 and 2 shows Coomassie blue staining of the Sepharose beads after the actin - binding experiment . Lane 3 shows the binding of actin filaments in buffer B to FP 243 - 585 . Lane 4 shows the bind - ing experiment of filament - free monomeric actin in buffer B with FP 243 - 585 Sepharose beads . The actin - binding in lanes 3 and 4 was detected by immunoblotting with an actin monoclonal antibody in a dilution of 1 : 2 , 500 . SDS - PAGE gels ( not shown ) . These results show that the mi - nor binding proteins do not mediate the binding of filament actin to GST - ezrin . They also show that the EzC domain binds only actin . With increasing salt less actin bound to FP 477 - 585 Sepharose beads ( Fig . 4 , lanes 4 - 7 ) . This can be explained by the short filaments which do not bind in the lower NaCl concentrations ( 0 . 5 M ) while long filaments can bind to the GST - ezrin - Sepharose beads even in 1 . 0 M Natl . Most of the binding was lost in 0 . 5 M NaCl indicating that the actin bind - ing of ezrin is mediated mainly by electrostatic interactions . Also the GST - ezrin fusion protein FP 243 - 585 had the same binding profile ( not shown ) . The GST - ezrin fusion proteins containing the COOH - terminal region of ezrin were partially degraded during the bacterial growth or purification of the fusion proteins . The use of proteinase inhibitors did not eliminate the degrada - tion . The short incubation and centrifugation times during the purification were essential to reduce the degradation . In Fig . 2 ( lanes 2 - 8 ) , the lower minor bands are probably degradation products , since they were stained by antibodies to ezrin . The negative staining of the degradation products with the monoclonal antibody Z036 ( detecting the region 575 - 585 ) shows that the degradation products of the fusion proteins FP 243 - 585 , FP 507 - 585 , FP 477 - 585 , and FP 552 - 585 ( Fig . 2 , lanes 2 , 6 , 7 , and 9 , respectively ) seen in immu - noblotting lack the COOH terminus of ezrin . The negative actin - binding result with the COOH - terminal domain where six amino acids were omitted from the COOH terminus ( Fig . 3 A , lane 3 and FP 477 - 579 in Fig . 6 ) shows that the possible degradation products are not responsible for the actin binding . We also used purified rabbit muscle actin to demonstrate the direct binding of actin to ezrin . While the GST - Sepharose control beads did not bind purified rabbit muscle F - actin ( Fig . 5 , lane / ) , the F - actin was bound to FP 243 - 585 Turunen et al . Actin - binding Site of Ezrin 1449 Figure 6 . Location of the actin - binding site in ezrin . [ 35S ] Methi - onine - labeled JEG - 3 cell lysate was used in the actin - binding ex - periments done in buffer A : The actin binding with different GST - ezrin - Sepharose beads and GST - Sepharose beads was detected by autoradiography . The strong low molecular mass band in lane FP 1 - 308 is background binding . Sepharose beads in the same way as the actin from cell ly - sates ( Fig . 5 , lane 2 ) . Lanes 1 and 2 in Fig . 5 show Coomas - sic blue staining of the binding results . Although the concen - tration of purified actin in the binding experiments was in general 1 . 0 mg / ml , the binding of F - actin to FP 243 - 585 Sepharose beads could be detected easily in actin concentra - tions less than 0 . 1 mg / ml ( not shown ) . The results with the highly purified proteins confirm that filamentous actin bound directly to GST - ezrin and that for the binding no addi - tional protein factors were needed . Furthermore , we obtained evidence that the F - actin bound to GST - ezrin also in low salt concentration ( buffer B ) . When the G - actin solution was not free from the actin filaments we could see a clear binding to GST - ezrin ( FP 243 - 585 ; Fig . 5 , lane 3 ) . No binding of actin occurred in G - buffer when the filaments were removed by centrifugation ( 180 , 000 g for 2 h ; Fig . 5 , lane 4 ) . Lanes 3 and 4 in Fig . 5 show immunoblotting of the binding results with monoclonal actin antibodies . As a conclusion , physiological salt is needed only for the forma - tion of actin filaments but not for the binding of ezrin . This supports the possibility that ezrin could bind also monomeric actin but the affinity may be too low for the binding to be detected in affinity chromatography . Identification of the Actin - binding Site in Ezrin To identify the actin - binding site in ezrin we produced a se - ries of GST - ezrin fusion proteins containing overlapping parts of ezrin . A summary of the actin - binding results is shown in Fig . 1 . We observed that all the GST - ezrin fusion proteins binding actin contained an intact COOH terminus of ezrin . The NH2 - terminal domain ( FP 1 - 308 ; Fig . 6 ) as well as the predicted a - helical domain ( FP 279 - 531 and FP 279 - 485 ; Fig . 6 ) did not bind actin in physiological salt con - centration . Already the omission of six COOH - terminal amino acids of ezrin fully prevented any actin binding ( Fig . 3 A , lane 3 ; FP 477 - 579 in Fig . 6 ) . This shows that if other parts in ezrin were binding actin the intact COOH terminus was needed for the binding to occur . The negative actin bind - ing of the fusion proteins FP 279 - 485 and FP 477 - 579 was confirmed also with the purified muscle F - actin ( not shown ) . Since SDS in the purification of fusion protein FP 1 - 308 might affect the binding properties of FP 1 - 308 , it is not fully ruled out that EzN could not bind actin in different condi - tions . The actin - binding capability was confined to a stretch of 34 amino acids at the COOH terminus of ezrin ( FP 552 - 585 ; Fig . 6 ) . Both actin in cell lysate ( Fig . 6 ) and purified muscle actin ( not shown ) bound to FP 552 - 585 . The inability of different GST - ezrin fusion proteins missing the COOH ter - minus of ezrin ( FP 1 - 308 , FP 279 - 531 , FP 279 - 485 , and FP 47 % 579 ) to bind actin shows that possible bacterial impuri - ties or unspecific binding to any fusion protein are not responsible for the observed actin binding of GST - ezrin . The actin binding was specific to a short COOH - terminal region in ezrin . Since the COOH terminus of FP 47 % 579 contains a few additional amino acids ( GSPGIHRD ) expressed from the vector , theoretically these amino acids could also prevent the actin binding of a site located nearby . Consequently , we cannot conclude that the short acidic COOH - terminal region ( 579 - 585 ) would be the site binding to actin . Discussion The actin binding of ezrin detected in our affinity - chromato - graphic assay confirms the earlier suggestions that ezrin has a structural role in microvilli and other cell surface struc - tures linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane . Our results showing that the actin - binding site is located within the 34 COOH - terminal amino acids of ezrin confirm the ear - lier models of the domain structure of ezrin . The expression of truncated ezrins in CV - 1 monkey kidney cells had already suggested that the actin - binding site is located in the COOH - terminal region comprising Ezc ~ and EzC domains ( Algrain et al . , 1993 ) . Since the spectrin / actin - binding site in protein 4 . 1 is located in the middle of the protein it has been pro - posed that the predicted c ~ - helical domain in ezrin would be responsible for the actin binding ( Krieg and Hunter , 1992 ) . The limited homology in this region to several cytoskeletal proteins gives additional support to this hypothesis ( Turunen et al . , 1989 ; Gould et al . , 1989 ) . However , in our experiments we could not find any direct actin binding in the Eza domain . A contribution of the Ezc ~ domain to the actin - binding of ezrin is not ruled out , since the Eza domain has 23 - 28 % identity with tropomyosin or ~ 40 % similarity when the identical positions of hydropho - bic and charged amino acids are counted in addition . The similarity without any gaps in the sequence ( about 100 amino acids ) covers two pairs out of seven a and f3 quasi - equivalent actin - binding sites in tropomyosin ( Parry , 1975 ; McLacMan and Stewart , 1976 ; Hitchcock - DeGregori and Varnell , 1990 ) . In addition , the Ezot domain is partially am - phipathic with hydrophobic amino acids concentrated at po - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 126 , 1994 1450 Figure 7 .

Percentage sequence identities are shown in comparison to ezrin . sitions a and d in the repeat of seven amino acids ( unpub - lished data ) . Consequently , the Ezot domain could form a tropomyosin - like actin - binding surface . The homologies of the Ezot domain to different cytoskeletal proteins , like tropomyosin , myosin , caidesmon , troponin T , and keratins ( Turunen et al . , 1989 ; Gould et al . , 1989 ) may also indicate interactions with several proteins in the cortical cytoskeleton . The sequence identities between ezrin , radixin , moesin , merlin ( also called schwannomin ) , and EM10 protein are strongest in the NH2 - terminal domain . The identity be - tween ezrin , radixin , and moesin in this region is over 80 % , while the average identity of the whole proteins is 75 % . The identity between merlin and other members of the protein family is 62 % in the NHe - terminal domain and 48 % for the whole proteins . EM10 protein shows 43 % overall identity with ezrin and 55 % identity in the NH2 - terminai domain . The differences appear mostly in the predicted ot - helicai and COOH - terminai domains ( see Fig . 7 ) . For example , a long proline - rich region at the end of the predicted ot - hdical do - main is found in ezrin , radixin and merlin , but not in moesin and EM10 protein . In addition , the predicted a - helical do - main is longer in moesin than in the other proteins . The strong similarities in the amino acid sequences and similar cellular locations suggest a common role for ezrin protein family as membrane - cytoskeleton linkers . The mem - bers of the protein family - ezrin , moesin , and radixin - are located in various cell surface structures where they colocal - ize with actin ( Bretscher , 1983 ; Gould et ai . , 1986 ; Pakka - nen et al . , 1987 ; Pakkanen , 1988 ; Hanzel et al . , 1989 ; Tsu - kita et al . , 1989 ; Sato et al . , 1991 , 1992 ; Furthmayr et al . , 1992 ; Berryman et al . , 1993 ; Franck et al . , 1993 ) . Also EM10 protein has a cell surface location ( Frosch et al . , 1991 ) . The different phosphorylation patterns of ezrin , moe - sin , and radixin indicate different ways to regulate each pro - tein ( Fazioli et al . , 1993 ; Franck et ai . , 1993 ) . The COOH - terminal region of 25 amino acids in ezrin , moesin , radixin , and EM10 protein forms the most con - served region in the whole COOH - terminal domain ( Fig . 8 A ) , as also noted by Lankes et al . ( 1993 ) . Especially , the comparison with EM10 sequence shows that the homology is centered around the conserved tyrosine ( Tyr - 564 in ezrin ) . The high degree of sequence homology in this region could be indicative of a common actin - binding site . Only radixin has been reported to bind actin ( Tsukita et al . , 1989 ) , but no data on a specific actin - binding site are yet available . The COOH - terminal sequence of merlin / schwannomin does not show any remarkable homology to the actin - binding site of ezrin and does not have the conserved tyrosine ( see Fig . 7 A ) . The cellular location of merlin / schwannomin , the tumor suppressor for neurofibromatosis 2 ( Rouleau et ai . , 1993 ; Trofatter et al . , 1993 ) , has not yet been reported . It will be interesting to see whether merlin / schwannomin can A h - ezrin 478 VYEpVSY ~ VQESI .

Actin - binding Site of Ezrin 1451 bind to actin , since it is not ruled out that it has at its COOH terminus some amino acids essential for the actin - binding . A new feature of merlin / sehwarmomin is the finding of alter - native splicing transcripts affecting the COOH terminus of the protein ( Arakawa et al . , 1994 ; Haase et al . , 1994 ; Hara et al . , 1994 ; Pykett et al . , 1994 ) . The alternative splicing could change or even regulate the binding properties of merlin / schwannomin . The region 558 - 578 in ezrin , ( see Fig . 8 B ) moesin , radixin , and EM10 protein shows high sequence homology also with a potential actin - binding site in the myosin heavy chain ( Keane et al . , 1990 ; Vandekerckhove and Vancomper - nolle , 1992 ) and the actin - binding site of CapZ / 3 subunit ( Hug et al . , 1992 ) . Especially , the KYKXL motif ( " K " refers here to both K and R ) is found in skeletal and cardiac myosin heavy chains , brush border myosin I ( a microvillus protein ) , CapZ / 3 subunit and the ezrin protein family , except merlin / schwannomin . In myosin heavy chains the KYKXL motif is located in the middle of the protein in the S1 head domain , but does not belong to the major actin - binding sites observed in the crystallographic studies ( Rayment et al . , 1993 ; Schrtder et al . , 1993 ) . Furthermore , the KYKXL motif is not fully conserved in all myosins ( see Fig . 8 B ) . Although the peptide made from this site binds actin ( Keane et al . , 1990 ) , the importance of the site for the actin binding in my - osins is not clear . In CapZ / 3 subunit the actin - binding site is localized in a short COOH - terminal region like in ezrin . In addition , the distance of the KYKXL motif from the COOH terminus differs in CapZ / 3 subunit only by one amino acid from that in ezrin . CapZ and radixin are reported to be barbed end - capping proteins ( Casella et al . , 1987 ; Tsukita et al . , 1989 ) and be - longs to class II actin - capping proteins that do not sever actin ( for review see Weeds and Maciver , 1993 ) . Although the actin - capping activity is not fully ruled out , the immunoelec - tron microscopical observations ( Pakkanen et al . , 1987 ; Ber - ryman et al . , 1993 ) implicate lateral binding of ezrin to actin filaments to be a major form of interaction of ezrin with actin in microvilli . In this respect ezrin has a similar location in microvilli as brush border myosin I ( for reviews see Lou - vard , 1989 ; Bretscher , 1991 ) . The actin - binding site at the COOH terminus of ezrin is a strongly basic region ( amino acids 558 - 578 ) ending in a short stretch of acidic and hydrophobic amino acids ( 579 - 585 ) . Several actin - binding sites in other actin - binding pro - teins are positively charged interacting with acidic amino acids in actin ( for reviews see Kabsch and Vandekerckhove , 1992 ; Vandekerckhove and Vancompernolle , 1992 ) . More data are required to localize exactly the amino acids in ezrin responsible for the actin binding . To understand the role of ezrin protein family in the dynamics of the cell surface struc - tures it will be important to determine the influence of ezrin and the other members of the protein family on the behavior of actin . Since experimental evidence for a direct interaction of ez - rin with actin has been difficult to obtain ( Bretscher , 1983 , 1991 ; Krieg and Hunter , 1992 ) , it has been proposed that phosphorylation would be crucial for the interaction of ezrin with actin ( Krieg and Hunter , 1992 ) . Consequently , purified cellular ezrin would occur in a form where the actin - binding site is masked . The phosphorylation of tyrosine or ser - ine / thrConine ( Bretscher , 1989 ; Hanzel et al . , 1991 ; Fazioli et al . , 1993 ) could be a signal opening the actin - binding site in ezrin . Furthermore , it is possible that the affinity of the actin - binding site in ezrin is so weak that only the binding of filament actin to immobilized ezrin ( and possibly not the binding of free ezrin to actin ) can be seen in the actin - binding assay . Stronger binding occurs presumably in the affinity chromatography when F - actin is bound to the GST - ezrin - Sepharose in several points of the filament . Monomeric actin could be lost during the washings in the case that it binds ez - rin weakly . In principle , several factors may contribute to the loss of actin binding of cellular ezrin during the purification . Evidence for a masked actin - binding site comes from the expression of ezrin cDNA in cultured cells . Expression studies with full - length ezrin and COOH - terminal part of ez - rin in cultured cells have indicated that the binding of ezrin to the cytoskeleton is dependent on the unmasking of the binding site in ezrin ( Algrain et al . , 1993 ) . Both full - length ezrin and the COOH - terminal part of ezrin expressed from cDNA colocalized to microvilli and other cell surface struc - tures . However , the full - length ezrin did not bind to stress fibers , whereas the COOH - terminal part of ezrin expressed in cells is seen to be colocalized with stress fibers in im - munofluorescence analysis ( Algraln et al . , 1993 ) . This shows that the truncated ezrin missing the NH2 - terminal domain has lost its physiological regulation of the binding to cytoskeleton . The inability of full - length ezrin to bind to stress fibers indicates that the actin - binding site of ezrin must be unmasked by specific signals for the binding to actin to occur . The cloning of phosphotyrosine phosphatases sharing over 30 % identity with the EzN domain gives indirect support for the phosphorylation as an essential regulatory signal in the function of ezrin protein family ( Gu et al . , 1991 ; Yang and Tonks , 1991 ) . This is indicated also by experimental data . In A - 431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells stimulated by EGF , the tyrosine and serine are transiently phosphorylated , concomitantly with the redistribution of ezrin to microvilli ( Bretscher , 1989 ) . In gastric parietal cells the phosphoryla - tion of serine is increased when ezrin is induced to redistrib - ute to microvilli ( Urushidani et al . , 1989 ) . More data on the structure - function relationship are required to understand how the phosphorylation regulates ezrin . Tyr - 145 and Tyr - 353 have been identified as the major tyrosine phosphoryla - tion sites of ezrin in the EGF stimulated A - 431 cells ( Krieg and Hunter , 1992 ) . Another potential site for the regulation by tyrosine phosphorylation is the conserved Tyr - 564 in KYKXL motif of the actin - binding site in ezrin . One theoret - ical mechanism for tyrosine or serine / threonine phosphory - lation to regulate actin - binding would be by an influence on the dimerization of ezrin ( Ullrich et al . , 1986 ; Pakkanen and Vaheri , 1989 ; Gary and Bretscher , 1993 ) .
