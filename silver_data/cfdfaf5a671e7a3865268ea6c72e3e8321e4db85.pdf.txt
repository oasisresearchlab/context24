RES EAR CH A RT I C LE Open Access Inhibition of Raf - MEK - ERK and Hypoxia pathways by Phyllanthus prevents metastasis in human lung ( A549 ) cancer cell line Sau Har Lee 1 , Indu Bala Jaganath 2 , Rishya Manikam 3 and Shamala Devi Sekaran 1 * Abstract Background : Lung cancer constitutes one of the malignancies with the greatest incidence and mortality rates with 1 . 6 million new cases and 1 . 4 million deaths each year . Prognosis remains poor due to deleterious development of multidrug resistance resulting in less than 15 % lung cancer patients reaching five years survival . We have previously shown that Phyllanthus induced apoptosis in conjunction with its antimetastastic action . In the current study , we aimed to determine the signaling pathways utilized by Phyllanthus to exert its antimetastatic activities . Methods : Cancer 10 - pathway reporter array was performed to screen the pathways affected by Phyllanthus in lung carcinoma cell line ( A549 ) to exert its antimetastatic effects . Results from this array were then confirmed with western blotting , cell cycle analysis , zymography technique , and cell based ELISA assay for human total iNOS . Two - dimensional gel electrophoresis was subsequently carried out to study the differential protein expressions in A549 after treatment with Phyllanthus . Results : Phyllanthus was observed to cause antimetastatic activities by inhibiting ERK1 / 2 pathway via suppression of Raf protein . Inhibition of this pathway resulted in the suppression of MMP2 , MMP7 , and MMP9 expression to stop A549 metastasis . Phyllanthus also inhibits hypoxia pathway via inhibition of HIF - 1 α that led to reduced VEGF and iNOS expressions . Proteomic analysis revealed a number of proteins downregulated by Phyllanthus that were involved in metastatic processes , including invasion and mobility proteins ( cytoskeletal proteins ) , transcriptional proteins ( proliferating cell nuclear antigen ; zinc finger protein ) , antiapoptotic protein ( Bcl2 ) and various glycolytic enzymes . Among the four Phyllanthus species tested , P . urinaria showed the greatest antimetastatic activity . Conclusions : Phyllanthus inhibits A549 metastasis by suppressing ERK1 / 2 and hypoxia pathways that led to suppression of various critical proteins for A549 invasion and migration . Keywords : Phyllanthus , Metastasis , Apoptosis , ERK1 / 2 , HIF - 1 α Background Lung cancer constitutes one of the malignancies with the greatest incidence and mortality rates with 1 . 6 million new cases and 1 . 4 million deaths each year [ 1 , 2 ] . Although initial use of platin - based cytotoxic chemotherapy improved the overall survival rate and life quality of the patients , the outcome remains poor due to deleterious development of drug resistance resulting in less than 15 % lung cancer patients surviving for at least five years [ 2 , 3 ] . Approximately 80 - 85 % of the lung cancer patients are diagnosed with an advanced stage of non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) that has limited therapeutic options due to metastasis [ 1 , 4 , 5 ] and among the three types of NSCLC , patients identified with squamous carcinoma which involves lymph node metastasis accounts for 60 % [ 5 , 6 ] . In the advance stage of NSCLC , surgery is not possible to remove all apparent lesions hence leading to the high rate of cancer recurrence [ 7 ] . Therefore , lethality of lung cancer is often attributed to late diagnosis , metastasis , and the occurrence of drug resistance [ 8 ] . Thus , the development of an efficient cancer diagnostic method is crucial since an early detection of cancer while it is still localized and curable is one of the * Correspondence : shamalamy @ yahoo . com 1 Department of Medical Microbiology , Faculty of Medicine , Universiti Malaya , Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia Full list of author information is available at the end of the article © 2013 Lee et al . ; licensee BioMed Central Ltd .

This requires an understanding of the patho - physiology of the disease [ 10 , 11 ] which can be made possible via proteomic studies . Cancer proteomics allow the screening of early diagnostic markers or potential drug targets [ 6 ] by comparing the proteomes of the diseased and diseased - treated samples that allows identification of aberrantly expressed proteins [ 5 , 10 ] . These proteins could be biomarker candidates to expedite non - invasive diagnosis of early - stage malignant tumor , as well as to aid the monitoring of tumor progression and therapy effectiveness [ 12 ] . Similar to other malignant pathologies , tumor markers for NSCLC remained inad - equate . Serum biomarkers employed in the current clinical setting such as ENO ( enolase alpha ) , CEA ( carcinoembryonic antigen ) , SCC ( squamous cell carcinoma ) , CA - 125 ( cancer antigen 125 ) or TPA ( tissue polypeptide antigen ) are not satisfactory due to their low sensitivity and specificity [ 13 , 14 ] . In the quest for novel diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers , the proteomic technique is ideal since it permits qualitative and quantitative analysis of numerous proteins simultaneously [ 9 , 13 ] . Moreover , the search for biomarkers at the protein level is more dependable than at the transcriptional level as protein expression may not necessarily associate with mRNA expression [ 14 ] . Natural - product based drugs are gaining their popularity as preventive medicines or for health management , and hence this has spurred an intensive search for bioactive plant - derived anticancer compounds [ 15 ] . The genus Phyllanthus is one of the most widely distributed plants throughout the Amazon rainforests as well as other tropical and subtropical regions . Abundant studies on Phyllanthus spp . started in the late 1980 ′ s when the clinical efficacy of Phyllanthus niruri against viral Hepatitis B was observed [ 16 ] . Various therapeutic actions of this genus have been reported , including being antihepatotoxic , antilithic , antihy - pertensive , anticarcinogenic , and most recently anti - HIV as well [ 16 - 19 ] . We have demonstrated antimetastatic and antiproliferative activities of Phyllanthus against several metastatic cell lines such as lung carcinoma ( A549 ) , breast ( MCF - 7 ) carcinomas [ 17 ] , melanoma ( MeWo ) , as well as prostate ( PC - 3 ) carcinoma [ 20 ] . Nevertheless , the exact mechanisms for the antimetastatic activities of Phyllanthus are still uncertain . MAP kinase ( MAPK ) is one of the signaling pathways known to mediate metastasis via transmission of extracellular stimuli into the nucleus that activate the serine / threonine kinases which belong to the MAPK superfamily [ 21 ] . MAPK serine / threonine superfamily is made up of three well - described subgroups , including ERK1 / 2 or p44 / 42 MAPK , JNK / SAPK , and p38 MAPK . These diverse pathways with dis - tinct downstream targets are activated by various stimuli to regulate cell proliferation , apoptosis , and metastasis [ 21 , 22 ] . Regulation of metastasis by MAPK is mainly via con - trolling the cells ’ expression of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) enzymes by decreasing the nuclear levels of NF κ B , c - Fos , or c - Jun [ 21 , 22 ] . The MMPs are a family of at least 20 members of highly homologous , zinc - and calcium - dependent endopeptidases which can degrade virtually all extracellular matrix ( ECM ) components [ 23 ] . Among these MMPs , MMP2 and MMP9 are abundantly expressed , secreted , and activated in various malignant tumors [ 22 , 24 ] . Recent studies also shown that MMP7 plays an essential role in ectodomain shedding of cell - surface molecules such as EGFR , HB - EGF , Fas ligand , and E - cadherin in addition to its ability to degrade ECM components . Therefore , these enzymes are the most vital ones implicated in cancer invasion and metastasis [ 24 , 25 ] . Hypoxia pathway is another chief regulator of metastatic process . Hypoxia - inducible factor - 1 ( HIF - 1 ) is the deter - mining factor for oxygen - dependent gene regulation and is a dimer of HIF - 1 α and HIF - 1 β . Its regulation is mainly governed by the transactivation and stabilization of HIF - 1 α protein resided in the cytoplasm [ 26 ] . Under normoxia con - dition , HIF - 1 α instantaneously interacts with von Hipple – Lindau ( pVHL ) ubiquitin E3 ligase complex and is targeted for proteasomal degradation due to hydroxylation of two specific proline residues within the oxygen - dependent deg - radation domain by prolyl hydroxylases [ 7 , 26 ] . Contrarily , HIF - 1 α will be stabilized with increased expression during hypoxic condition , allowing it to translocate into the nu - cleus and dimerize with HIF - 1 β . HIF - 1 will subsequently bind to the hypoxia response elements to regulate transcrip - tion of over 100 target genes which favors tumor growth and metastasis , including vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) as well as genes that regulate cellular processes such as energy metabolism , cell proliferation , vascular development and remodelling , as well as vasotone [ 2 , 7 , 26 ] . In our previous study , Phyllanthus extracts were shown to inhibit A549 ( lung carcinoma ) cells growth with IC 50 values ranging from 60 – 130 μ g / ml and 200 – 470 μ g / ml for methanolic and aqueous extracts respectively [ 17 ] . We also demonstrated that they effectively reduced invasion , migration , and adhesion activities of A549 cells in a dose - dependent manner and was capable of inducing apoptosis along with its antimetastastic action [ 17 ] . Therefore , the main objective of this study was to determine the protein expression profile of Phyllanthus - treated A549 cells and how the signaling pathways were utilized by Phyllanthus in order to exert its antiproliferative and antimetastatic activities on this cell line . Methods Plant extracts and standard drugs The crude extracts ( aqueous and methanolic ) of each Phyllanthus spp . , namely P . niruri , P . urinaria , P . watsonii and P . amarus , were obtained from the Malaysian Lee et al . BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2013 , 13 : 271 Page 2 of 20 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1472 - 6882 / 13 / 271 Agriculture and Research Development Institute ( MARDI ) , Malaysia . The aqueous extracts were prepared by dissolving 10 mg in 1ml of sterile PBS ( Final concentra - tion 10 mg / ml ) , whereas , the methanolic extracts were prepared by dissolving 40 mg in 1ml of DMSO ( Final con - centration 40 mg / ml ) . The tubes containing the extracts were wrapped with aluminium foil and stored at - 20°C until use . A single batch of extracts was used for all the ex - periments . The IC 50 concentrations that were used as one of the treatment conditions in most of the experimental assays ( Table 1 ) as well as the polyphenol contents of these extracts have been determined and published in the previ - ous study [ 17 ] . Cisplatin and Doxorubicin ( MERCK – 1 mg / ml ) as standard anticancer drugs for lung and breast carcinomas respectively were included as the controls . Cell culture Human lung carcinoma ( A549 ) cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , USA ) and was grown in RPMI - 1640 ( Roswell Park Memorial Institute ) . To ensure growth and viability of the cells , the mediums were supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Gibco ) and incubated in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 at 37°C . Transient transfection and cancer 10 - pathway reporter array Cancer is a group of diseases strongly correlated with de - fects in signal transduction proteins . Various key signaling pathways have been implicated in human tumorigenesis . Analysis of these signaling pathways was performed using Cignal Finder Cancer 10 - pathway Reporter Array kit ( SABiosciences , QIAGEN , USA ) . Transient transfection was performed using TransIT - LT1 ( Mirus Bio , USA ) . Both plasmid DNAs for the respective signal - ing pathways provided in the kit as well as TransIT - LT1 were diluted using Opti - MEM I reduced serum medium ( Invitrogen , USA ) . After that , plasmid DNAs and the TransIT - LT1 was mixed to allow TransIT - LT1 / DNA complex formation . Subsequently , 90 μ l ( approxi - mately 10000 cells ) of the cell suspension were mixed with 10 μ l of the complex and added into the desig - nated wells of a 96 - well cell culture white microplate ( Nunc , Thermo Fisher Scientific , USA ) . The culture plate was rocked for 5 minutes on a rocker before it was incubated in a 5 % CO 2 incubator at 37ºC overnight . After the transfection of cells with various plasmid DNAs for the respective signaling pathways , the cells were incubated with different Phyllanthus extracts for another 24 hours . Dual - Glo Luciferase reagent was then added into each well and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes before reading the firefly luminescence generated using the GloMax Multi Detection System ( Promega , USA ) . This was followed by the addition of Dual - Glo Stop & Glo reagent to all wells . Similarly , another renilla luminescence reading was obtained after the plate was incubated for another 10 minutes . The firefly constructs monitor changes in the activity of a key transcription factor which is a downstream target of a particular signaling pathway . Meanwhile , renilla construct acts as an internal control for transfection effi - ciencies normalization as well as to monitor cell viability . Luminescence for each wells were determined by calculat - ing the ratio of its firefly to renilla luminescence . Cell cycle analysis DNA content analysis is performed by Propidium iodide ( PI ) staining which binds to the distinct amount of DNA content in the cells at different phases of the cell cycle . Briefly , cells were seeded at 10 5 cells / well , treated with extracts at their IC 50 values , and incubated at various time periods from 0 to 72 hours . At the end of each incuba - tion period , cells treated with or without Phyllanthus extracts were harvested and fixed with ice - cold 70 % ethanol for at least 1 hour at - 20ºC . Cells were then pelleted , washed once with PBS , resuspended in the PI solution [ 10 μ g / ml PI ( Sigma ) and 1mg / ml RNase A in PBS ] , and incubated in a 37°C water bath for 30 minutes . Data acquisition was performed using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer and CellQuest software and subsequently analysed using WinMDI 2 . 9 software . The distribution of cell percentages in each cell cycle phase is determined by setting gates based on their amount of DNA content . Preparation of cytoplasmic protein lysate Protein lysates were prepared for western blotting and proteomic analysis for both Phyllanthus - treated and untreated samples . Cells treated with Phyllanthus extracts were detached from the culture plates using 0 . 5 % trypsin - EDTA and washed twice with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , centrifuging at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes . Two hundred microliters of lysis buffer Table 1 Cytotoxic effect [ IC 50 ( μ g / ml ) ] of Phyllanthus extracts against A549 and MCF - 7 IC 50 ( μ g / ml ) ± SEM Cancer cell lines Solvents A549 MCF - 7 Plantextracts P . niruri ( P . n ) Aqueous 466 . 7 ± 41 . 63 179 . 7 ± 0 . 58 Methanolic 128 . 3 ± 17 . 56 62 . 3 ± 9 . 07 P . urinaria ( P . u ) Aqueous 215 . 0 ± 21 . 79 139 . 3 ± 1 . 16 Methanolic 69 . 0 ± 11 . 53 48 . 7 ± 10 . 02 P . watsonii ( P . w ) Aqueous 198 . 3 ± 10 . 41 104 . 0 ± 10 . 39 Methanolic 61 . 3 ± 16 . 17 49 . 0 ± 8 . 19 P . amarus ( P . a ) Aqueous 240 . 0 ± 26 . 46 156 . 7 ± 5 . 77 Methanolic 126 . 7 ± 7 . 64 56 . 3 ± 6 . 66 Lee et al .

After that , the sample was in - cubated at - 20°C overnight and centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C . After centrifugation , the super - natant was discarded while the cytoplasmic protein pel - let was diluted in 150 μ l of rehydration buffer ( 7 M urea , 2 M thiourea , 2 % CHAPS , 0 . 5 % IPG Buffer , 0 . 002 % bromophenol blue ) . Cytoplasmic protein lysate was either stored at - 80°C for storage or quantified immediately for subsequent experiments . Western blot assay Protein lysate concentration was determined using 2 - D Quant kit ( GE Healthcare , USA ) according to the manu - facturer ’ s instructions . For one - dimensional western blotting , thirty micrograms protein of each samples were mixed with 4× sample buffer ( 50mM Tris - HCl [ pH6 . 8 ] , 2 % SDS , 10 % glycerol , 1 % β - mercaptoethanol , 12 . 5mM EDTA , 0 . 02 % bromophenol blue ) before they were loaded on a 12 . 5 % of SDS - polyacrylamide gel . The proteins were separated at 100V for approximately 1 hour . Alternatively , one hundred and fifty micrograms for each protein samples were separated by two - dimensional ( 2D ) gel electrophoresis method using 7 cm IPG gel strips with pH 3 – 11 NL range ( GE Healthcare , USA ) . After elec - trophoresis , the stack or sandwich was assembled and the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose mem - brane ( GE Healthcare , USA ) at 250 mA for 1 hour . After the transfer , the membrane was blocked with Tris buffered saline buffer consisting 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ( TBST ) and 5 % dry milk . Subsequently , membranes were incubated with various primary antibodies and secondary antibodies diluted using blocking solution . The immune - reacted proteins were detected via chromogenic method by addition of DAB substrate onto the membrane to form a protein band . Anti - pan - Ras , anti - c - Raf , anti - c - Myc , anti - Bcl - 2 , anti - Hif - 1 α , anti - c - Jun / AP - 1 , anti - p53 , anti - Elk1 , anti - JNK1 / 2 , anti - VEGF , goat anti - mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate , and goat anti - rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate antibodies were purchased from Merck Millipore , Germany while anti - RSK antibody was purchased from Thermo Fischer Scientific , USA . These antibodies were chosen based on their essential roles in the pathways modulated by Phyllanthus as detected using the Cignal Finder Cancer 10 - pathway Reporter Array . A p53 antibody was included to deter - mine any involvement of p53 pathway in response to Phyllanthus treatment . Zymography assay Zymography is a simple and sensitive technique employed to study extracellular matrix - degrading proteases such as MMPs based on their substrate specificity and molecular weight . Briefly , cells were seeded at 1 × 10 5 cells / well in a 24 - well microtiter plate and treated with increa - sing concentrations of aqueous ( 50 μ g / ml , IC 50 , 500 μ g / ml ) and methanolic ( 20 μ g / ml , IC 50 , 200 μ g / ml ) extracts . After 72 hours incubation , supernatants were col - lected and stored at - 20°C to be used as conditioned media . The conditioned media was mixed with 2× sample buffer ( 0 . 5M Tris - HCl [ pH6 . 8 ] , 87 % glycerol , 10 % SDS , 0 . 1 % bromophenol blue ) and subsequently loaded onto a 12 . 5 % SDS - polyacrylamide gels that had been copolymerized with 0 . 1 % gelatin or 0 . 2 % casein . The gel was then run at ap - proximately 125V for about 60 minutes . When the proteins were completely resolved , the gel was washed twice with renaturing buffer ( 2 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ) on a shaker at room temperature , 1 hour for each washing . Next , the gel was in - cubated with developing buffer ( 12 . 1 g Tris , 63 g Tris - HCl , 117 g NaCl , 7 . 4 g CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 % Brij35 , 1L distilled water ) overnight at 37°C before it was stained with 0 . 1 % Coomasie blue for 1 hour . Finally , the gel was destained with destaining solution and the presence of matrix metallo - proteinase enzyme was indicated as an opaque , unstained band against a dark blue background . Human total iNOS and GADPH immunoassay Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase ( iNOS ) is often upregulated in tumor cells and is an important regulator for vascularization and angiogenesis . In order to measure the total iNOS in whole cell , a cell - based ELISA , Human Total iNOS Immunoassay ( R & D Systems , USA ) was performed according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . 2 - Dimensional gel electrophoresis Five hundred microgram proteins for A549 cells ( treated and untreated samples ) were rehydrated overnight on 13 cm IPG gel strips with pH 3 – 11 NL range ( GE Healthcare , USA ) . Strips rehydrated with proteins were then transferred into IPG chambers and focused using Ettan IPGphor Isoelectric Focusing unit ( GE Healthcare , USA ) . Before proceeding with SDS - PAGE , the strips were first subjected to a two - step equilibration procedure for 15 minutes each . Firstly , they were equili - brated with an SDS - PAGE equilibration base buffer added with 2 % ( w / v ) Dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , followed by equilibra - tion with 2 . 5 % ( w / v ) Iodoacetamide ( IAA ) . The strips were then placed onto a 12 . 5 % SDS - PAGE gel and sealed with agarose sealing solution . Second dimensional separation was carried out using Ettan Dalt twelve Separation Unit ( GE Healthcare , USA ) . The gels were then fixed using gel fixative solution and stained with Coomasie dye . Finally , the gel was destained with destaining solution and imaged using Ettan DIGE Imager ( GE Healthcare , USA ) . Three independent gels were run for each treatment ( n = 3 ) . Gel images were analyzed using PDQuest 2 - D Analysis Lee et al . BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2013 , 13 : 271 Page 4 of 20 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1472 - 6882 / 13 / 271 Software ( Bio - Rad , USA ) which performed background removal , normalization , and automatic matching of the detected protein spots . Protein spots with more than 2 - fold differential expression that showed significant difference ( p < 0 . 05 ) were selected and excised for mass spectrometry analysis . In - gel enzyme digestion Protein spots excised from gels were first destained using 50 % acetonitrile ( ACN ) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and then incubated with 10mM DTT for 30 minutes at 60°C followed by incubation with 55 mM iodoacetamide for 20 minutes in the dark . The gel plugs were then washed with 50 % ACN in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate before incubation with 100 % ACN for 15 min on a shaker and dried using SpeedVac . The dried gel plugs were subsequently incubated with 6 ng / μ l trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate over - night at 37°C , vortexed briefly and spun down before 50 % and 100 % ACN were added and shaken for 15 minutes each . The supernatant of each round of extraction was transferred into a fresh tube before the digested samples were completely dried using SpeedVac . The samples can be kept at - 20°C until further use . Otherwise , extracted peptides were concentrated or desalted using ZipTip C18 microcolumns ( Merck Millipore , Germany ) . MALDI - TOF / TOF mass spectrometry and database searching Prior to MALDI - TOF / TOF analysis , 3 μ l of each extracted peptide sample solution was mixed with 3 μ l of alpha - cyano - 4 - hydroxycinnamic acid ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) matrix solution dissolved in 50 % aqueous ACN containing 0 . 1 % trifluoroacetic acid ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) . A volume of 0 . 7 μ l of each sample was applied onto a MALDI plate and was allowed to air dry at room temperature . Analysis was performed with ABSCIEX 4800 MALDI - TOF / TOF ( AB SCIEX , USA ) operated in the re - flector for MALDI - TOF / TOF with fully automated mode using the 4800 Series Explorer software at an accelerat - ing voltage of 20 kV . Calibration was performed using Mass Standards Kit for Calibration of AB SCIEX TOF / TOF ™ Instruments ( AB SCIEX , USA ) . Data collected from the MALDI - TOF / TOF were submitted to the SwissProt database using the MASCOT search algorithm ( version 2 . 1 . 0 , Matrix Science , London , UK ) . Typical search param - eters for both search engines were defined as follows : tryp - sin digestion allowing up to two tryptic - mass cleavages , variable modifications of oxidation and carbamidomethyl , maximal mass tolerance of 0 . 1Da , precursor tolerance of 100 ppm , and taxonomy Homo sapiens . Protein scores greater than 55 were considered significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) . The protein with the highest number of peptides was consid - ered as those corresponding to the spot if multiple proteins were identified in a single spot . The proteins iden - tified were then compared with Uniprot KB / Swiss - Prot database and grouped according to the Eukaryotic Orthologous Group of Classifications ( COGs ) . Data analysis Results were expressed as the mean ± Standard Error Mean ( SEM ) of data obtained from three independent experiments . All data were analyzed using one way ANOVA , followed by Dunnett ’ s test for pairwise comparison . P < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant for all tests . Results Determination of signaling pathways affected by Phyllanthus The Cignal Finder Cancer 10 - pathway reporter array was used to simultaneous screen 10 main cellular pathways that are targeted by Phyllanthus in its anticancer activities . The pathways included in this array include Wnt , Notch , p53 / DNA damage , TGF β , Cell cycle / pRb - E2F , NF κ B , Myc / Max , Hypoxia , MAPK / ERK , and MAPK / JNK , with GFP construct plasmid DNA as the positive control for this array . As shown in Figure 1A ( aqueous extracts - treated A549 ) and 1B ( methanolic extracts - treated A549 ) , the expression of GFP construct was consistent in both the aqueous and methanolic extracts - treated and untreated - control A549 cells , hence the results obtained were deemed valid . Upon treatment with various aqueous and methanolic extracts , most of these pathways ’ expression [ Myc / Max , Hypoxia , and MAPK ( ERK and JNK ) ] decreased sig - nificantly ( p < 0 . 05 ) except for NF κ B which indicate Phyllanthus probably did not modulate this pathway . The aqueous Phyllanthus extracts showed better inhibitory activity on the expression of both MAP kinase pathways , while the methanolic extracts showed enhanced inhibition on the expression of Hypoxia and Myc / Max pathways . Among the four plant species , P . watsonii exhibited greatest suppression on Hypoxia ( aqueous – 60 % and methanolic – 86 % ) , ERK ( aqueous – 47 % and methanolic – 27 % ) , and JNK ( aqueous – 50 % and methanolic – 26 % ) pathways , followed by P . urinaria , P . amarus , and P . niruri . From the flow cytomery - based cell cycle analysis , we did not observe cell cycle phase arrest in the A549 cells treated with Phyllanthus extracts ( Figure 2 ) since the percentage of gated cells for each cell cycle phases ( G 0 / G 1 , S , and G 2 / M ) did not change significantly ( p > 0 . 05 ) between the untreated and extracts - treated cells . Thus , this further explained the low expression level of cell cycle / pRb - E2F pathway in both the untreated and treated A549 cells . Nevertheless , the percentages decreased with a concurrent increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells ( increase in Sub G 1 phase ) at increasing incubation Lee et al .

Conversely , there was an accumulation of cells at G 2 / M phase for A549 cells treated with Cisplatin and Doxorubicin . Modulation of intracellular signaling molecules expression by Phyllanthus In order to confirm the effects of Phyllanthus on MAPK and Hypoxia pathways , western blots were performed with available antibodies ( Anti - pan - Ras , anti - c - Raf , anti - c - Myc , anti - Bcl - 2 , anti - Hif - 1 α , anti - c - Jun / AP - 1 , anti - p53 , anti - Elk1 , anti - JNK1 / 2 , anti - VEGF , and anti - RSK ) to determine the specific targets of Phyllanthus , whether it affects during the early or late stages of the signaling cascade . Figure 3A to I showed the blots for untreated A549 control as well as the A549 treated with various aqueous and methanolic extracts while Figure 3K depicts the expression level of each protein . In untreated A549 , the proteins detected were Pan - Ras , c - Raf , c - Jun / AP - 1 , Elk - 1 , c - Myc , and HIF - 1 α . The presence of these proteins reflects the specific involvement of MAPK / ERK and Hypoxia pathways in regulating the A549 cells ’ growth and survival . In addition , Bcl - 2 protein was also detected in untreated A549 which explains its role as an antiapoptotic agent to ensure cell ’ s survival [ 27 ] . Besides that , FUSE - binding proteins were also detected although antibody specific to this protein was not included in this experiment . This might probably be attributed to its role for proper regulation of the c - Myc protooncogene [ 28 ] , as it has a certain percentage of similarity with c - Myc protein and was therefore detected when c - Myc antibody was used . As expected , most of these proteins ’ expression decreased when A549 was treated with various Phyllanthus extracts . Among the four species , P . urinaria showed better inhibition on those proteins , followed by P . amarus , P . watsonii , and P . niruri for both the aque - ous and methanolic extracts . The expression of Pan - Ras and Elk - 1 proteins were only mildly affected as compared to the other proteins and p53 expression was hardly seen in both the treated and untreated A549 cells via western blot technique , thus confirming the findings obtained from the previous cancer 10 - pathway array which demon - strated low p53 expression in A549 .

Among the variety of MMPs , MMP2 , MMP7 , and MMP9 were more commonly associated with cancer metastasis as they have the ability to degrade collagen type IV which is the major component of basement membrane [ 23 , 25 ] . MMP7 probably plays a greater role in A549 metastasis since its expression was Figure 2 Percentage of cell cycle phase distribution of A549 cells treated with both aqueous and methanolic Phyllanthus extracts and standard drugs at their IC 50 ( μ g / ml ) concentrations for ( a ) 24 hours , ( b ) 48 hours , and ( c ) 72 hours .

Nonetheless , their expressions de - creased in a dose - dependent manner as shown by the untreated - control and Phyllanthus - treated bands ’ intensity in Figure 4 . However , the bands for proMMPs with their respective MMPs were not well separated in the zymo - gram , hence leading to the inability to distinguish between the active and latent MMPs . Methanolic Phyllanthus extracts demonstrated greater inhibition on the MMPs ’ expression than aqueous extracts , with P . urinaria show - ing the greatest inhibitory activity compared to the other Phyllanthus species .

During hypoxia , cytoplasmic HIF - 1 α subunit stabilization will lead to the activation of various genes including vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and inducible nitric oxide synthases ( iNOS ) [ 30 ] . This was verified with the high expression of both VEGF and iNOS detected in the untreated - control A549 cells ( Figure 5 ) using a cell - based ELISA assay . Upon treatment with vari - ous Phyllanthus , both the aqueous and methanolic extracts for all four species were observed to demonstrate inhibition on iNOS , whereby most of their expres - sions dropped markedly to approximately 20 % except for methanolic P . urinaria which retained 40 % of iNOS expression . Generally , P . urinaria ( 78 % reduc - tion ) scored highest iNOS inhibition among aqueous extracts while P . watsonii ( 82 % reduction ) exhibited strongest activity among methanolic extracts . This suppression ability was comparable to Cisplatin and Doxorubicin with 15 % and 10 % iNOS expression that remained after treatment respectively . On the other hand , methanolic Phyllanthus extracts showed better suppression of VEGF expression with 60 – 80 % reduction compared to aqueous extracts which caused 20 – 50 % reduction . In addition to this ELISA assay , expression of VEGF was also confirmed by western blot assay when VEGF expression dropped to 30 – 80 % after A549 cells were treated with aqueous and methanolic Phyllanthus extracts ( Figure 3J and K ) . Among the four species , methanolic P . amarus displayed better VEGF repression with only 20 % VEGF expression . Meanwhile , P . urinaria exhibited slightly weaker capability to inhibit VEGF expression with 25 % ( aqueous ) and 65 % ( methanolic ) reduction respectively . Differentially expressed proteins in Phyllanthus - treated A549 Figure 6 showed representative 2D - PAGE gels for untreated - control , aqueous P . watsonii - treated , and methanolic P . watsonii - treated A549 samples . Two - dimensional gel electrophoresis proteomic analysis picked out 68 and 79 protein spots differentially expressed in aqueous and methanolic extracts - treated groups respectively . Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis and database examination using MASCOT identified 52 protein spots significantly downregulated by aqueous Phyllanthus extracts as listed in Table 2 . These protein spots were further categorized according to Clusters of Orthologous Groups ( COGs ) classification and majority of them fell into the category of post - translational modification , protein turnover , and chaperones , followed by intracellular traffick - ing , secretion , and vesicular transport , cytoskeleton , as well as energy production and conversion ( Figure 7A ) . On the other hand , methanolic Phyllanthus extracts significantly suppressed 64 proteins as tabulated in Table 3 . Most of these proteins fell into the category of signal transduction mechanisms , transcription , defense mechanisms , amino acid transport and metabolism , as well as secondary metab - olites biosynthesis , transport , and catabolism ( Figure 7B ) . The negative ( - ) symbol in both Tables 2 and 3 signified suppression of the proteins and a value of 1 . 00 indicates the complete absence of this protein in the Phyllanthus - treated sample as compared to the untreated - control sample and the degree of suppression reduces as the value increases .

Therefore , it is crucial to develop novel antimetastatic drugs with low toxicity and high efficacy [ 17 , 29 ] . In our previous study , aqueous and methanolic extracts of Phyllanthus was shown to possess the potential to inhibit growth of A549 in a time - and dose - dependent manner with minimal toxicity to the normal lung epithelial ( NL20 ) cells . Besides that , Phyllanthus suppressed the invasion , migration , and reattachment of A549 in a dose - dependent manner and was capable of inducing apoptosis in conjunction with its antimetastastic action [ 17 ] . However , the underlying mechanisms that confer their antimetastatic and apoptosis - inducing abilities were uncertain . In the current study , numerous differentially expressed proteins were being identified in A549 cells in response to Phyllanthus treatments using 2DE - based proteomic approach . Both aqueous and methanolic Phyllanthus extracts modulate expression of different set of proteins [ 17 ] . Among the four Phyllanthus species , P . urinaria generally demonstrated the greatest activity on A549 , closely followed by P . watsonii , P . amarus , and P . niruri . This could be delineated by the higher number of polyphenol compounds present in both the aqueous ( 9 out of 10 polyphenols ) and methanolic ( 3 out of 4 polyphenols ) P . urinaria extracts [ 17 , 20 ] , hence having a higher capability to cause antimetastatic activities on A549 . Some of those proteins were represented by more Figure 5 Expression level of ( a ) iNOS and ( b ) VEGF in untreated and Phyllanthus - treated A549 cells .

Therefore , protein turnover , chaperones , and post - translational modification are indeed crucial to produce many variants of the common amino acid that possess distinctive structures and functions essential for tumor growth [ 31 , 32 ] . In order to ensure uninterrupted cell growth , continuous protein synthesis is necessary . Therefore , 40S ribosomal protein is normally upregulated in the tumor cell as it is an essential component of the higher eukaryotic ribosome that is necessary for proper protein translational function [ 33 ] . Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit 12 is another important component as it binds to poly ( A ) - binding protein to initiate translation process [ 34 ] . Protein folding is the subsequent critical process upon successful protein translation to ensure formation of functional proteins and this step usually requires the presence of chaperone proteins . One of these proteins is Hsp60 whose primary role is to guide the folding of mitochondrial proteins while facilitating proteolytic degradation of denatured or misfolded proteins in an ATP - dependent manner [ 35 ] . Other chaperones include peptidyl - prolyl cis - trans isomerase A and T - complex protein 1 subunit epsilon which also assists the proper folding of proteins [ 36 , 37 ] . Besides facilitating protein folding , chaperones also guide the proper assembly of other proteins for them to carry out their activities . An important example is stress - induced phosphoprotein 1 that facilitates association of molecular chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp 90 which have been implicated in MMP2 activity that lead to increased invasiveness [ 38 ] . Downregulation of these proteins by Phyllanthus is therefore one of the key processes for A549 growth and metastasis inhibition by reducing functional protein synthesis and suppression of MMP expression . In addition to MMP2 , suppression of other MMPs in response to Phyllanthus treatment was also observed including MMP7 and MMP9 . Tumor invasion and metastasis depends largely on the integrity of the basement membrane which is frequently destroyed by a number of proteolytic enzymes such as MMPs in order to access the vasculature to develop distant metastases [ 22 ] . Among the MMPs family , MMP2 and MMP9 were more commonly associated with cancer invasion and metastasis since they had been known to be able to degrade type IV collagen - rich basement membrane of vessel wall [ 23 ] . MMP7 ( 28 kDa ) is another member of the MMP family with broad substrate specificity against ECM components such as elastin , type IV collagen , fibronectin , vitronectin , aggrecan , and proteoglycans [ 25 ] . Reduced expression of these MMP enzymes explains the decreased aggressiveness of A549 cells ’ invasion upon treatment with Phyllanthus . A constant activation of various growth - promoting signaling pathways is also required to ensure continuous cell growth and survival . This activation often involves numerous proteins which require some form of modifi - cations such as phosphorylation for their biological role . Thus , post - translational modification process that alters the proteins properties is important [ 39 , 40 ] . The first step for pathway activation often requires the presence of receptor molecules on the cell surface for ligand Figure 6 Representative 2D - PAGE gels for ( a and b ) untreated - control A549 and its aqueous P . watsonii - treated A549 , as well as ( c and d ) untreated - control A549 and its methanolic P . watsonii - treated A549 .

So , guanine nucleotide - binding protein , putative Ras - related protein Rab - 42 , and GTPase HRas precursor protein which can be broadly grouped as G - proteins , as well as probable G - protein coupled receptor 179 precur - sor expressions are usually elevated in the tumor cells to accommodate the large amount of extracellular signals to be transduced into the cells [ 41 ] . Both G - protein coupled receptor and G - proteins form the G - protein mediated signaling cascade whereby binding of ligands to receptors will lead to activation of G - proteins by pro - moting GDP / GTP exchange , which in turn regulates many effector molecules such as proteins kinases [ 41 ] . Therefore , the subsequent upregulated protein in the tumor cell is serine / threonine - protein kinase 6 which is a family of kinases including MAP kinase [ 42 ] , which functions to turn on the downstream kinases via serine / threonine phosphorylation [ 43 ] . Suppression of these cell signaling proteins by Phyllanthus could therefore decelerate or stop the constitutive activation of the growth - promoting pathways such as MAP kinase and hypoxia . ERK1 / 2 pathway is one of the MAP kinase subgroup which was frequently found to be inhibited in A549 to repress cells ’ continuous growth and metastasis . In a study by Shih et al . [ 21 ] , α - tomatine found in tomatoes was shown to be capable of inactivating extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 and 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) pathway to inhibit metastasis Figure 7 Clusters of Orthologous Groups ( COGs ) classification of identified proteins in A549 cells treated with ( a ) aqueous Phyllanthus extracts and ( b ) methanolic Phyllanthus extracts .

Similarly , A549 metastasis was also inhibited by Silibinin isolated from Silybum marianum which suppresses ERK1 / 2 pathway that led to a reduced expression of MMP2 and u - PA concomitantly with a significant inhibition on cell invasion [ 22 ] . Indeed , our study also showed that Phyllanthus inhibit A549 metastasis via targeting specifically ERK1 / 2 pathway . ERK1 / 2 module is often thought as a linear pathway since ERK is the effector of an evolutionarily conserved sig - naling component that is triggered exclusively by the Raf serine / threonine kinases [ 44 , 45 ] . Therefore , Phyllanthus might possibly downregulate Raf protein at the early stage of the pathway , resulting in the subsequent suppression of other proteins ’ expression down the pathway . As a result , various biological activities controlled by ERK1 / 2 pathway to increase cell growth and malignancy are repressed , including regulation of transcriptional , cell cycle , apoptosis , and metastasis [ 46 ] . Transcription is an important biological activity in a cell as it is the first step for the transmission of genetic information from DNA into RNA to be translated into proteins [ 47 ] . With the suppression of the essential transcriptional proteins for eukaryotic chromosomal DNA replication such as DNA - directed RNA polymerase II 16kDa polypeptide , transcription elongation factor B polypeptide 1 , and proliferating cell nuclear antigen , transcription initiation and elongation process becomes inefficient [ 48 , 49 ] . Besides that , zinc finger protein 174 is a DNA binding protein that acts as a cofactor for transcrip - tion factor . Its downregulation will lead to increased tran - scription of proteins such as E - cadherin which in turn represses cell invasion [ 50 ] . Also , cell cycle disorder plays a critical role in cancer progression . So , modulation of cell cycle by phytochemicals from natural product sources is gaining worldwide attention to control carcinogenesis [ 51 ] . However , our findings showed that cell cycle pathway was not modulated with the flow cytometric data showing insignificant shifts in each cell cycle phases for the cells treated with Phyllanthus extracts . Hence , cell cycle arrest was ruled out as one of the mechanism of actions of the extracts . Since Phyllanthus do not inflict cell cycle arrest on A549 , the only approach to inhibit A549 ′ s continuous growth is by causing toxicity . As showed in the previous study , Phyllanthus does induce apoptosis in A549 with more than three folds increase of caspases - 3 and - 7 , the presence of DNA - fragmentation and TUNEL - positive cells [ 17 ] . In order to determine whether Phyllanthus induces extrinsic or intrinsic apoptotic pathway , Bcl - 2 expression was examined using immunoblot analysis since it is one of the main regulators of the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization which initiates intrinsic apoptotic cell death [ 52 , 53 ] . The data obtained agrees with our previous hypothesis that Phyllanthus probably activates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by inhibiting antiapoptotic Bcl - 2 protein to release cytochrome c for caspases activation . In addition to this , proteomic analysis also observed downregulation of Bcl - 2 - like protein 11 which is similar to Bcl - 2 protein that has a role as an antiapoptotic protein [ 52 ] . Apart from that , suppressing MAP kinases and its downstream factors such as AP - 1 have been shown to decrease MMPs expression and sub - sequently inhibit various pathological processes such as tumor invasion , adhesion , metastasis , and angiogenesis [ 22 , 24 ] . This is in accordance with results from the current study that showed decreased ERK1 / 2 pathway and MMPs activity by Phyllanthus which led to inhibition of A549 me - tastasis . Moreover , Phyllanthus extracts also suppressed cytoskeletal proteins such as actin , vimentin , tubulin alpha chain , actin - related protein , and cofilin - 1 / 2 . Besides being the components of the cytoskeleton , both actin and tubulin - binding proteins are also mediators of motility [ 8 ] . Structure , conformational dynamics , and mechanical prop - erties of actin filaments are mainly controlled by cofilin [ 54 ] . Meanwhile , vimentin constitutes the intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton which stabilizes cytoskeletal interactions as well as affecting cell motility and movement . Elevated expression of vimentin in several invasive cell lines suggests the possibility of it being a representative marker for epithelial to mesenchymal transition [ 38 ] . Therefore , the significant inhibitory effects of Phyllanthus on the A549 cell ’ s cytoskeleton most probably involve the alteration of the microfilament organization and function , therefore suppressing motility and metastasis [ 55 ] . Hypoxia is largely perceived as another major obstacle to cancer therapy as increasing evidence in the cancer therapy - related literatures suggests the involvement of proangiogenic factors in the progression of lung tumori - genesis [ 7 ] . Angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and survival due to the imbalance of nutrient and oxygen supplies to solid tumors larger than 1 mm 3 , resulting in tumor hypoxia [ 56 ] . One of the major regu - latory component which responds to hypoxia to ensure cell survival and to promote angiogenesis is HIF - 1 α [ 2 , 7 ] . Therefore , it could possibly be the target for the development of novel anticancer agents . Lin et al . [ 7 ] demonstrated suppression of lung tumor angiogenesis and metastasis by andrographolide isolated from Andrographis paniculata which downregulates HIF - 1 α . In addition , inhibition of HIF - 1 α pathway by HIF - 1 α – siRNA displayed a direct correlation with A549 cellular proliferation and angiogenesis , a prerequisite for metastasis [ 26 ] . In agreement to these studies , our results obtained also showed the reduction of HIF - 1 α expression in A549 cells treated with Phyllanthus extracts . This in turn led to the suppression of various target genes con - trolled by HIF - 1 α via hypoxia - responsive - element ( HRE ) [ 26 ] , including angiogenesis , metabolism , cell growth , and death [ 2 ] . Lee et al . BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2013 , 13 : 271 Page 17 of 20 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1472 - 6882 / 13 / 271 VEGF is another crucial angiogenic growth factor which induces endothelial cell proliferation from the pre - existing capillary bed for wound healing , tumor growth , and metastasis . Its expression is therefore increased prior to an invasive and metastatic phenotype [ 56 ] . Also iNOS , one of the three distinct isoforms of NOS which is widely expressed and often upregulated in multiple tumor tissues [ 57 ] is expressed in tumor cells associated with vascularization and hence , is probably another important regulator of angiogenesis [ 56 , 57 ] . Nitric oxide ( NO ) produced by NOS have been shown to affect vascular permeability , induce extracellular matrix degradation , trigger VEGF production , as well as stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration [ 30 ] . Hence , inhibition of VEGF and iNOS by Phyllanthus can greatly reduce A549 angiogenesis , resulting in tumor cells malnutrition and hypoxia thereby preventing tumor growth , survival , and metastasis . Adenosine 5 ′ - triphosphate , a major source of energy for cells and its involvement in a variety of cellular activities which are ATP - dependent is often increased in tumor cells [ 58 ] . Downregulation of these enzymes activities by Phyllanthus causes cellular energy deficit that can result in cancer cell death . One example is enolase which catalyzes conversion of 2 - phosphoglyceric acid ( PGA ) to phosphoenolpyruvate ( PEP ) in the anabolic pathway during gluconeogenesis to enhance aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells [ 59 ] . Other enzymes suppressed include glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydro - genase , fructose - biphosphate aldolase A , phosphoglycerate mutase 1 , and triosephosphate isomerase that are also in - volved in energy metabolism [ 55 , 60 ] . Besides exploiting cellular signaling pathways for their growth and metastasis , tumor cells possess efficient drug detoxification system to remove compounds that may be fatal to them . This includes upregulation of glutathione transferase omega - 1 that catalyzes binding of glutathione to various anticancer compounds such as cisplatin , thereby decreasing production of platinum - DNA adducts and ren - dering them useless while glutathione synthetase catalyzes production of glutathione substrate for the detoxifying activity [ 61 , 62 ] . Similarly , metallothionein also plays a role in chemotherapy binding and detoxification since its ele - vated expression was noticed in several cisplatin - resistant lung cancer cell lines [ 61 ] . Meanwhile , Annexin A4 is nor - mally associated with chemoresistance in part by enhancing drug efflux [ 63 ] . Inhibition of these detoxification enzymes expressions in A549 after treatment with Phyllanthus as demonstrated from the proteomic analysis therefore advo - cates the reduced A549 drug - resistance capability resulting in their susceptibility to death - inducing compounds . Conclusions All the findings obtained in this study point to the involve - ment of ERK1 / 2 and hypoxia pathways which were suppressed by Phyllanthus to inhibit A549 proliferation , angiogenesis , invasion , and metastasis . Inhibition of ERK1 / 2 pathway led to downregulation of invasion and mobility proteins ( MMP2 ; MMP7 ; MMP9 ; cytoskeletal proteins ) , transcriptional proteins ( proliferating cell nuclear antigen ; zinc finger protein ) , and antiapoptotic protein ( Bcl2 ) while inhibition of hypoxia pathway causes repression of angiogenic proteins ( VEGF ; iNOS ) and various glycolytic enzymes . Suppression of drug detoxi - fication enzymes such as gluthathione transferase and metallothionein also increases sensitivity of A549 to Phyllanthus treatment . Among the four Phyllanthus species tested in this study , P . urinaria was found to be the most effective to inhibit A549 growth and metastasis , closely followed by P . watsonii . Thus , Phyllanthus could be a valuable candidate in the treatment of metastatic can - cers . However , the main concern before application of Phyllanthus as an antimetastatic or antiproliferative agent is its in vivo effect . Thus , further testing of the extracts ac - tivity in vivo is necessary to exploit it as a chemotherapeu - tic agent . Preliminary work has identified low toxicity of Phyllanthus in an animal model as dosage greater than 50 g / kg is needed to cause 100 % acute death in the mice tested ( unpublished data ) and subsequent efficacy testing in a tumor - bearing mice model needs to be carried out .
