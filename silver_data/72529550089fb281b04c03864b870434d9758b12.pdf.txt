Mast cells and corticotropin - releasing factor ( CRF ) regulate the mucosal barrier in human colon . Because eosinophils are often increased in colon tissues of patients with UC , we assessed in - teractions among mast cells , CRF , and eosinophils in the mucosal barrier of these patients . METHODS : Transmucosal ﬂuxes of protein antigens ( horseradish peroxidase ) and paracellular markers ( 51 Cr - EDTA , ﬂu - orescein isothiocyanate – dextran 4000 ) were studied in noninﬂamed , colonic mucosal biopsy samples col - lected from 26 patients with UC and 53 healthy vol - unteers ( controls ) ; samples were mounted in Ussing chambers . We also performed ﬂuorescence and elec - tron microscopy of human tissue samples , assessed isolated eosinophils , and performed mechanistic stud - ies using in vitro cocultured eosinophils ( 15HL - 60 ) , mast cells ( HMC - 1 ) , and a colonic epithelial cell line ( T84 ) . RESULTS : Colon tissues from patients with UC had signiﬁcant increases in permeability to protein antigens compared with controls . Permeability was blocked by atropine ( a muscarinic receptor antago - nist ) , (cid:1) - helical CRF ( 9 – 41 ) ( a CRF receptor antagonist ) , and lodoxamide ( a mast - cell stabilizer ) . Eosinophils were increased in number in UC tissues ( compared with controls ) , expressed the most M2 and M3 mus - carinic receptors of any mucosal cell type , and had immunoreactivity to CRF . In coculture studies , carba - chol activation of eosinophils caused production of CRF and activation of mast cells , which increased permeability of T84 epithelial cells to macromolecules . CONCLUSIONS : We identiﬁed a neuroimmune in - tercellular circuit ( from cholinergic nerves , via eo - sinophils to mast cells ) that mediates colonic mu - cosal barrier dysfunction in patients with UC . This circuit might exacerbate mucosal inﬂammation . Keywords : Intestinal Permeability ; Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease ; Immune Response ; Stress . I nappropriate innate immune responses , including al - terations of the mucosal barrier can , in the geneti - cally susceptible host , lead to inﬂammatory bowel dis - ease ( IBD ) . 1 Increased intestinal permeability in IBD patients is well - established . 2 Tumor necrosis factor – (cid:1) and , in ulcerative colitis ( UC ) , interleukin - 13 , increase paracellular permeability by reducing the number of intercellular strand molecules in tight junctions and by enhancing epithelial cell apoptosis . 3 – 5 Other studies have shown increased transcellular passage of antigens in patients with IBD . 6 – 8 The mechanisms that regulate transcellular uptake are not fully understood , but likely involve tumor necrosis factor – (cid:1) . 8 The notion of barrier dysfunction as an important part of the patho - physiology of UC is further supported by recent ge - nome - wide association studies showing that polymor - phisms of barrier - related molecules predispose to development of disease . 9 , 10 Although somewhat disputed , consistent epidemiolog - ical evidence supports the adverse inﬂuence of stressful life events in the clinical course of UC . 11 – 13 Underlying mechanisms are complex and remain incompletely un - derstood ; however , cholinergic pathways seem to mediate disturbances in epithelial water and salt absorption in the human jejunum in response to acute psychological stress . 14 Also , stressed rats show increased permeability to protein antigens by mechanisms involving mast cells , corticotrophin - releasing factor ( CRF ) , and cholinergic signaling pathways . 15 – 18 In a recent study , we demon - strated that CRF mediates transcellular uptake of the protein antigen horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) in human colonic mucosa by activating CRF R 1 and CRF R 2 on mast cells . 19 Moreover , there is evidence of non - neuronal cholinergic activity in the human colon , 20 , 21 which can be Abbreviations used in this paper : CCh , carbachol ; CRF , corticotropin - releasing factor ; HMC - 1 , human mast cell line - 1 ; HRP , horseradish peroxidase ; Isc , short circuit current ; Lod , lodoxamide tromethamine ; mRNA , messenger RNA ; TER , transmucosal electrical resistance . © 2011 by the AGA Institute 0016 - 5085 / $ 36 . 00 doi : 10 . 1053 / j . gastro . 2011 . 01 . 042 B A S I C – A L I M E N T A R Y T R A C T GASTROENTEROLOGY 2011 ; 140 : 1597 – 1607 altered in patients with UC . 21 However , how human colonic barrier function is regulated by cholinergic sig - nals is largely unknown . Eosinophils are normally present in the intestinal mu - cosa , participating in host defense . 22 In UC , the numbers of mucosal eosinophils are increased 23 and display an activated phenotype in both active and quiescent UC compared to healthy individuals . 24 Moreover , increased levels of eosinophil products in intestinal perfusion ﬂuid obtained from patients with UC suggest active involve - ment of eosinophils in the inﬂammatory process of this disease . 25 The aim of this study was to characterize macromo - lecular permeability in noninﬂamed colon of UC and elucidate any mechanistic role of cholinergic signaling , mast cells , and eosinophils in the regulation of human colonic permeability . We present evidence of a novel intercellular circuit involving muscarinic receptors on CRF - producing eosinophils and activation of mast cells , leading to increased macromolecular uptake in the colonic mucosa . This pathway may be an impor - tant component of the proinﬂammatory process in UC . Materials and Methods ( see also Supplementary Methods ) Subjects and Endoscopy UC patients . Twenty - six UC patients in clinical remission were enrolled in this study ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Inclusion criteria were UC with diagnosis based on clinical ﬁndings , routine histopathology , and patient data in the nationwide Swedish IBD registry ( SWIBREG ) . Exclusion criteria were colitis of origin other than UC , ie , indeterminate colitis or Crohn’s colitis or history of other severe illness . Healthy volunteers . Fifty - three healthy volun - teers were included as controls . Inclusion criteria were : no medication , no smoking , no history of irritable bowel syndrome or other bowel symptoms , no family history of IBD , and normal clinical histology assessment of sigmoid colon biopsies . Crohn’s colitis patients . Biopsies from 4 patients with inactive disease were used for studies of mucosal eosinophil numbers ( see Supplementary Methods ) . All biopsies ( 8 – 12 per patient ) were taken from the sigmoid colon at a median of 30 cm ( range , 20 – 50 cm ) from the anal verge , 26 placed in 4°C Krebs – Ringer bicar - bonate buffer and transported to the laboratory within 20 minutes . The study protocol was approved by the Regional Eth - ical Committee , Linköping Sweden . Ussing Chamber Experiments Biopsies were mounted in modiﬁed Ussing chambers as described previously and validated . 19 , 26 Experiments were performed in open - circuit condi - tions with assessment of potential difference , transmu - cosal electrical resistance ( TER ) , and short circuit current ( Isc ) at the start of the experiment and at 2 - minute intervals thereafter . 26 The paracellular probes , 51 Cr - EDTA ( 3 . 25 (cid:2) M ) and ﬂuorescein isothio - cyanate – dextran 4000 ( 25 (cid:2) M ) , and the protein anti - gen , HRP type VI ( HRP molecular weight , 45 kDa , 10 (cid:2) M ) were used for permeability assessments . Samples of 0 . 3 mL from the serosal side were collected after 0 , 30 , 60 , and 90 minutes . To elucidate involvement of CRF receptors , mast cells , and muscarinic receptors , the nonspeciﬁc CRF receptor antagonist , (cid:1) - helical CRF ( 9 – 41 ) ( 10 (cid:1) 6 M ) , the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine ( 10 (cid:1) 6 M ) , or the mast cell stabilizing compound , lodoxamide tromethamine ( Lod ) ( 10 (cid:1) 5 M ) were added on the serosal side . 19 , 27 Effects of CCh in Healthy Volunteers Biopsies were exposed on the serosal side to 10 (cid:1) 7 (cid:1) 10 (cid:1) 5 M carbachol ( CCh ) ( cholinergic agonist ) with or without atropine , 4 - diphenylacetoxy - N - meth - ylpiperidine methiodide ( selective muscarinic receptor 3 antagonist ) , 28 hexamethonium ( nonselective nico - tinic receptor antagonist ) , 27 Lod ( mast cell stabilizer ) , or tetrodotoxin ( axonal Na (cid:2) - channel antagonist ) 28 added on the serosal side of the biopsies 20 minutes before CCh challenge . HRP and 51 Cr - EDTA ﬂuxes , and Isc and TER were followed . Microscopy Techniques Immunohistochemistry . The different primary antibodies and protocol used are summarized in Supple - mentary Table 2 . Incubation times for primary antisera were overnight , followed by incubations with secondary antisera conjugated to ﬂuorescent markers ( 1 : 100 ) for 1 hour . Transmission electron microscopy . Tissues were ﬁxed and processed with standard techniques and then examined using a Hitachi H - 7000 microscope at 75 kV . Flow cytometry of peripheral blood eosino - phils . Eosinophils were isolated from heparinized blood by Percoll gradient centrifugation and negative selection using anti – CD16 - coated magnetic beads . The eosinophils ( 96 . 9 % (cid:3) 2 . 5 % purity ; 97 % (cid:3) 2 % viability ) were subse - quently resuspended in a buffer assigned for ﬂuores - cence - cell sorting and stained with antibodies against M1R , M2R , and M3R .

Rat mast cell line , RBL - 2H3 , and human mast cell line , HMC - 1 ( kind gift , Dr J . H . Butterﬁeld , Mayo Clinic , Roch - ester , MN ) , were used for mast cell studies . 15HL - 60 eosinophils ( 10 6 cells ) were activated with CCh 10 (cid:1) 4 M for 6 or 24 hours . Supernatant was collected and examined for CRF concentrations by enzyme immunoassay or added to 1 (cid:5) 10 6 RBL - 2H3 cells or 2 (cid:5) 10 6 HMC - 1 cells . As an indicator of mast cell degranulation , (cid:4) - hexosamini - dase release was measured . In addition , TER and HRP ﬂux were assessed in T84 monolayers 6 and 24 hours after being underlain by mast cells treated with eosino - phil supernatant ( CCh activated or not ) . Statistics Data are presented as mean (cid:3) standard error of mean . Comparisons between treatment groups were done using analysis of variance with post - hoc tests and Stu - dent t test as applicable ; comparisons of paired data were assessed with the paired t test .

Results Increased HRP Flux Across Colonic Mucosa in UC Patients Transmucosal ﬂux of the protein antigen HRP was increased in macroscopically noninﬂamed colon of UC pa - tients compared to mucosa from controls ( Figure 1 A ) . In contrast , permeability to the paracellular probes 51 Cr - EDTA ( Figure 1 B ) and ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate – dextran - 4000 ( Figure 1 C ) did not show signiﬁcant differences between the 2 groups . UC patients showed small but statistically signif - icant increases in TER compared to controls ( Figure 1 D ) . The Isc at start was higher in UC patients ( Figure 1 E ) , suggesting a higher secretory activity of the mucosa con - sistent with previous studies . 3 CCh - Induced Increases in HRP Fluxes Are Mediated via Muscarinic Pathways and Mast Cells CCh increased both Isc and HRP ﬂux in a dose - response manner ( Figure 2 A – B ) . No effects of CCh on the paracellular pathway were found , as assessed by TER or 51 Cr - EDTA permeability ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . CCh - induced increases in HRP ﬂux and Isc were inhib - ited by muscarinic receptor antagonists , atropine and 4 - diphenylacetoxy - N - methylpiperidine methiodide , whereas the nicotinic receptor blocker , hexamethonium , had no effect ( Figure 2 C – D ) on either index of epithelial activity . Also , Lod abolished the CCh - induced increases in Isc and HRP ﬂux , while tetrodotoxin did not alter the effect of CCh ( Figure 2 E – F ) . Increased Basal HRP Flux Across Mucosal Biopsies From Patients With UC Is Normalized by Atropine , CRF - Receptor Antagonism , and Mast Cell Stabilization Based on present CCh data ( Figure 2 ) and previ - ous ﬁndings on CRF and mast cells , 19 a role for these mediators in UC was assessed . Increased HRP permeation in macroscopically noninﬂamed UC biopsies was reduced to control levels by pretreatment with atropine , CRF ( 9 – 41 ) , and Lod ( Figure 3 A ) , whereas the antagonists had no signiﬁcant effects on HRP ﬂux in biopsies obtained from healthy volunteers ( Figure 3 B ) . Permeability to 51 Cr - EDTA , TER , and baseline Isc in the UC tissues were not signiﬁcantly affected by atropine , CRF ( 9 – 41 ) , or Lod ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . Muscarinic Receptor Staining in Colonic Mucosa Reveals M 2 and M 3 - Positive Eosinophils M 1 was expressed on a subset of the epithelial cells in the crypts ( Figure 4 A – B ) , whereas M 2 and M 3 receptor expression was restricted to subepithelial cells , which were identiﬁed as eosinophils by the coexpression of eosinophil peroxidase : 89 % and 87 % of M 2 / M 3 - positive Figure 1 .

B A S I C – A L I M E N T A R Y T R A C T May 2011 EOSINOPHILS AND BARRIER IN UC 1599 cells were eosinophil peroxidase – positive in UC and con - trol mucosa , respectively .

Only small numbers of eosinophils expressed the M 1 - receptor : 7 . 2 % in UC biopsies and 5 . 3 % in controls . Mast cells ( deﬁned by tryptase expression ) did not express muscarinic receptors , but were often situated in close proximity to M 2 and M 3 receptor ex - Figure 2 .

Importantly , the ab - solute number of eosinophils ( all M 2 - positive ) was in - creased in colonic biopsies from UC patients ( 31 . 4 (cid:3) 3 . 9 ; n (cid:7) 6 , Student t test ) compared to healthy volunteers ( 12 . 8 (cid:3) 1 . 7 cells per 0 . 1 mm 2 ; n (cid:7) 6 ; P (cid:6) . 01 ) ( Figure 5 A – B ) . There were also increased numbers of M 3 receptor – expressing eosinophils ( 19 . 4 (cid:3) 3 . 5 vs 10 . 7 (cid:3) 2 . 1 cells / 0 . 1 mm 2 ; P (cid:6) . 05 , Student t test ) , as well as of eosinophils expressing only M 2 ( 11 . 8 (cid:3) 2 . 6 vs 2 . 2 (cid:3) 1 . 1 cells / 0 . 1 mm 2 ; P (cid:6) . 05 ) in UC patients compared with controls . More - over , many eosinophils in the UC samples showed signs of piecemeal degranulation ( Figure 5 D – F ) , in contrast to what was found in control tissues ( Figure 5 C and E ) . As a comparison , no increase in the numbers of eosinophils ( eosinophil peroxidase – positive cells ) was seen in colonic mucosa of quiescent Crohn’s colitis ( Supplementary Fig - ure 1 ) . Muscarinic receptor expression was also assessed in blood eosinophils . In healthy controls ( n (cid:7) 5 ) M 2 and M 3 receptors were expressed on 12 . 9 % (cid:3) 2 . 2 % and 12 . 2 % (cid:3) 2 . 8 % of blood eosinophils , respectively . In patients with quiescent UC ( n (cid:7) 6 ) , M 2 was expressed in 7 . 2 % (cid:3) 1 . 8 % ( not different from controls ) , whereas M 3 expression , 2 . 9 % (cid:3) 0 . 9 % , was decreased compared to controls ( P (cid:6) . 05 , Student t test ) . M 1 receptors were expressed in low numbers ( (cid:6) 2 % ) in both groups . Fluorescence - activated cell sorting analysis of blood and mucosal eosinophils from the same individuals with UC revealed M 2 - receptor expression in 14 . 0 % and 85 . 3 % , and M 3 receptors in 15 . 2 % and 53 . 4 % of eosinophils from blood and mucosa , respec - tively . These data verify muscarinic receptor expression on eosinophils , and indicate phenotypic differences be - tween blood and mucosal eosinophils . Eosinophils Are Important Mucosal Sources of CRF CRF immunoreactivity in colonic mucosa was ex - pressed only in mucosal inﬂammatory cells ( Figure 6 A and C ) , which were found almost exclusively to be eosin - ophils ( Figure 6 B and D ) in both UC ( 92 % (cid:3) 8 % of CRF - positive cells ) and controls ( 93 % (cid:3) 3 % ) . The abso - lute number of CRF - positive eosinophils was signiﬁ - cantly increased in colonic mucosa of inactive UC at 27 (cid:3) 4 vs controls at 11 (cid:3) 2 cells / 0 . 1 mm 2 ( P (cid:6) . 05 , Student t test ) . Eosinophil Cell Line 15HL - 60 Expresses Functional Muscarinic Receptors That Regulate CRF Release and Promote Mast Cell Activation The human cell line , 15HL - 60 , displayed consti - tutive expression of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) for the M 1 , M 2 , and M 3 receptors ( Figure 7 A ) .

When 15HL - 60 eosinophils were stimulated with CCh for 24 hours , the release of CRF to the culture medium was signiﬁcantly increased ( Figure 7 B ) . Culture media collected from CCh - treated eosinophils activated both human - ( HMC - 1 ; Figure 7 C ) and rat - ( RBL ; Supple - mentary Figure 2 A ) derived mast cells as determined by (cid:4) - hexosaminidase release . Eosinophil - Activated Mast Cells Increase HRP Flux in T84 Cells Basolateral exposure of conﬂuent ﬁlter - grown T84 epithelial cell monolayers to differentiated 15HL - 60 cells for 24 hours (cid:3) CCh ( 10 (cid:1) 4 M ) did not alter the barrier properties of the epithelial monolayer as gauged by HRP ﬂuxes ( Figure 7 D ) and TER ( Supplementary Figure 2 B ) . In contrast , when T84 monolayers were cocul - tured with HMC - 1 cells activated by conditioned media from CCh - stimulated 15HL - 60 eosinophils , a 5 - fold in - crease in HRP ﬂux ( Figure 7 E ) and a small drop in TER ( Supplementary Figure 2 C ) were observed . Discussion The hypothesis of the “leaky gut” asserts that increased exposure to antigens due to intestinal barrier dysfunction drives an immune - mediated proinﬂamma - tory response . Here , experimental evidence is presented for cholinergic interaction with eosinophils and mast cells in the regulation of macromolecular permeability in human colonic mucosa , thereby delineating a novel mechanism for barrier dysfunction in patients with UC , which may be involved in exacerbation of the disease . Noninﬂamed biopsies from this patient cohort of in - active UC ( as determined by endoscopy , histology , and “normal” paracellular permeability ) displayed a 2 - fold in - crease in the transepithelial ﬂux of the protein antigen HRP compared to healthy controls . This ﬁnding conﬁrms earlier reports of increased permeability to macromolecules in pa - tients with UC in remission . 7 , 29 In studies of local colonic permeability in UC , no increase is seen in paracellular per - meability in noninﬂamed UC mucosa , 30 – 32 suggesting that Figure 6 .

B A S I C – A L I M E N T A R Y T R A C T May 2011 EOSINOPHILS AND BARRIER IN UC 1603 increased paracellular permeability in UC is secondary to inﬂammation and possibly involves myosin II regulatory light chain phosphorylation . 33 Transepithelial transport of protein antigens and bacteria are regulated by other mechanisms , 34 and can take place before alterations of the paracellular pathway . 6 , 7 , 35 This suggests that the dem - onstrated barrier alterations in noninﬂamed UC are likely to be important in early phases of recurrent inﬂamma - tion . Interestingly , the increased permeability to HRP in patients with UC returned to control levels when the biopsies were pretreated with atropine , the CRF antago - nist CRF ( 9 – 41 ) , or the mast cell stabilizer Lod . Eosino - phils are localized close to cholinergic neurons , mediate nerve remodeling , and induce release of acetylcholine from cholinergic nerves . 36 Here , we show evidence that eosinophils present in human colonic mucosa express the M 2 and M 3 cholinergic receptors and are a mucosal source of CRF . The former is important because it sug - gests that there can be bidirectional communication be - tween nerves and eosinophils , and the latter is notewor - thy because CRF has been shown to increase gut permeability . 19 , 37 We also found that CCh - stimulated eo - sinophils activated mast cells in vitro and further that conditioned medium from these activated mast cells evoked a subsequent increase in T84 epithelial permeability as as - sessed by the transepithelial ﬂux of HRP . However , eosino - phils alone , CCh alone , or these combined did not affect T84 barrier function . Collectively , these ﬁndings support a model whereby cholinergic signaling stimulates eosin - ophils to release CRF , which , by a paracrine manner , activates mast cells expressing CRF receptors to release mediators ( eg , tumor necrosis factor – (cid:1) 5 ) , thereby increas - ing antigen uptake across the colonic epithelium ( Sup - plementary Figure 3 ) . Several studies indicate the importance of cholinergic signaling in intestinal functions , 28 , 38 in mucosal inﬂam - mation , 39 and in the control of intestinal permeability in rodents . 37 , 40 Here , we demonstrate a CCh - induced in - crease in transcellular uptake of HRP in human colonic mucosa that was abolished by atropine and the M 3 an - tagonist , 4 - diphenylacetoxy - N - methylpiperidine methio - dide . Thus , in addition to controlling ion secretion , ace - tylcholine is also involved in regulating macromolecular permeability . These results are supported by earlier stud - ies in animals showing increased transcellular transport of large protein antigens after cholinergic stimula - tion , 28 , 41 which may have been mediated via M 3 recep - tors . 28 There are , however , concerns with speciﬁcity of muscarinic antagonists , 40 hence , the relative importance of different receptor subtypes to a physiological process must be interpreted with caution . In UC patients , both the increased ion secretion and elevated HRP ﬂux re - turned to normal by treatment with atropine , suggesting involvement of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the barrier dysfunction . Activation of muscarinic receptors in the intestinal mucosa is potentially important in the local response to stress transferred to the mucosa via extrinsic cholinergic nerves . 42 Moreover , evidence of a non - neuronal cholinergic system in the human colonic mucosa has been demonstrated previously , 21 which may modulate the local inﬂammatory response and be in - volved in regulation of the mucosal barrier . The exact cellular locations of the muscarinic receptors in the human colon have not been fully elucidated . Mast cells mediate changes in ion transport in the human gut and are found in increased numbers 43 , 44 and in a state of enhanced degranulation 45 in UC patients . In rodents , mast cells regulate the mucosal barrier to macromole - cules . 15 , 17 , 18 The present study showed that the mast cell stabilizer , Lod , normalizes increased transepithelial ﬂux of HRP in UC . We therefore proposed muscarinic recep - tors on mast cells as an explanation of the functional ﬁndings ; this was , however , not the case . Functional and mRNA data previously suggested M 3 receptors in human colonic cell lines and isolated crypts , 46 , 47 whereas we found no M 3 expression in human colonic epithelium in situ and no evidence of direct barrier regulation via epithelial muscarinic receptors despite mRNA expression of M 1 – 3 in T84 monolayers . Instead , we identiﬁed a high level of expression of M 2 and M 3 receptors on subepithe - lial eosinophils , with higher absolute numbers of both M 2 (cid:2) and M 3 (cid:2) eosinophils in UC biopsies compared to controls . Increased numbers and increased activation of eosinophils were previously demonstrated in UC mucosa even during inactive disease , 23 – 25 and our ﬁndings are in accordance with these data . Some mediators released from eosinophils ( eg , major basic protein ) appear to have the ability to directly affect colonic epithelial barrier function , 48 whereas in our in vitro analysis , eosinophils alone had negligible effects on epithelial barrier function . However , supernatant from CCh - treated eosinophils , and thus containing CRF , did cause mast cell activation , which in turn led to increased HRP ﬂux in T84 mono - layers . These novel ﬁndings provide strong support to the potential importance of eosinophil – mast cell interactions in the mucosal pathophysiology of UC . Close interac - tions between eosinophils and a speciﬁc phenotype of mast cells have recently been shown to be important in the pathogenesis of eosinophilic esophagitis , an emerg - ing disease entity . 49 Whether cholinergic pathways are also involved in this disease has not been elucidated . Immunohistochemical studies with tissues from pa - tients with UC have indicated enhanced expression of CRF and the CRF - related neuropeptides , urocortin I and II , in mucosal inﬂammatory cells 50 , 51 ; these CRF - produc - ing cells were not well - deﬁned and different functions and varying localizations in the intestine have been sug - gested . Our novel data from humans ( immunocolocal - ization , CRF mRNA in human eosinophil cell line , and release of CRF by isolated eosinophils ) provide evidence of CRF expression in submucosal eosinophils . The 10 % of B A S I C – A L I M E N T A R Y T R A C T 1604 WALLON ET AL GASTROENTEROLOGY Vol . 140 , No . 5 CRF - positive cells that were not eosinophils may be mu - cosal macrophages , as suggested by others . 50 , 52 In several previous studies , CRF - induced responses were mediated via mast cells . 19 , 37 , 53 Recently , we showed that colonic biopsies from healthy volunteers challenged with CRF had increased HRP uptake due to activation of CRF receptors on mast cells . 19 Taken together , this suggests the possibility that CRF acts as the signaling compound between eosinophils and mast cells in the pathogenesis of barrier dysfunction in UC . Previously , we reported that human intestinal biopsies have good viability in Ussing chambers and are a vali - dated technique to study transcellular uptake of protein antigens and paracellular permeability to marker mole - cules . 19 , 26 The UC patients in our study group were , on average , older ( median , 51 years ) than the healthy con - trols ( median , 23 years ) . However , there is no evidence for altered permeability in adults due to advancing chrono - logical age , 54 and there was no correlation between age and HRP permeability in the present study ( data not shown ) . Neither were there any differences in HRP ﬂux between the various medical treatments given to the UC patients ( data not shown ) . In conclusion , we demonstrate functional and micro - anatomical evidence of a chain of events that may ex - plain , at least in part , the increased permeability to protein antigens in patients with UC in remission . Pre - viously , separate studies have implicated cholinergic ac - tivity , 55 mast cells , 17 , 43 and CRF 50 in control of barrier function in intestinal disease . Here we integrate these ﬁndings by showing a sequential relationship between the different players , where eosinophils constitute an important , previously missing , link in the signaling events . Potentially , these neuroimmune events may be important as an integrated part of stress - related disease ﬂares . Because we found increased numbers of activated eosinophils in noninﬂamed UC but not in quiescent Crohn’s colitis as also shown in previous studies , 24 the signaling pathway described here may be more relevant to UC . The steps begin with a cholinergic signal to muscarinic ( M 2 or M 3 ) receptors on CRF - expressing eo - sinophils . The next step includes eosinophil - induced ac - tivation of CRF receptors on mast cells , which leads to degranulation and release of mast cell factors that gen - erate increased macromolecular uptake by the epithe - lium . 19 This model has implications in understanding the pathogenesis of mucosal inﬂammation in UC and should direct future treatment considerations for opti - mal management of the disease .
