The study investigates whether entrepreneurial self - efficacy and attitude mediate this relationship between creativity and entrepreneurial intentions using the theory of planned behavior ( TPB ) . In particular , this research also examines whether risk propensity moderates the relationship . An empirical survey is conducted and a total of 500 valid questionnaires are collected through online platforms . The data is analyzed by employing Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling and SPSS20 . 0 . The results indicate that self - efficacy is the strongest antecedent of entrepreneurial intention . Social support is found to directly influence entrepreneurial intention significantly , while the direct effect of creativity on intention is very marginal . Moreover , the results of the mediation analysis show that the relationship between creativity and entrepreneurial intention is fully mediated by self - efficacy and attitude , while the effect of social support on entrepreneurial intention is partially mediated . Specifically , the moderation effect of risk propensity on the relationship between creativity and entrepreneurial intention is acknowledged . Concrete suggestions are proposed for vocational colleges and governments to promote students’ entrepreneurial intentions . Finally , implications for the findings are provided .

Niu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1021969 Frontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin . org Introduction According to the statistics of the Ministry of Education of China , there will be 10 . 76 million fresh graduates from colleges and universities at all levels in 2022 in China , a net increase of 1 . 67 million over 2021 ( Ministry of Education of People ' s Republic of China , 2022 ) . This is the first time that the number of college graduates has exceeded 10 million , and also the year with the largest increase in recent years . The sharp increase in the number of employees has aggravated the pressure on employment . Meanwhile , the global spread of the epidemic has made the employment situation increasingly severe ( Akter et al . , 2020 ; Guerrero et al . , 2020 ) . Accordingly , it has great reference significance for studying the entrepreneurial intentions of other countries due to the large number of Chinese college graduates . Entrepreneurship is a competitive behavior that drives new markets , employment creation , and innovation . From the perspective of individuals , entrepreneurship can alleviate the employment pressure of vocational college students and cultivate an innovative spirit . From the perspective of society , entrepreneurship is the driving force of regional economic sustainable development ( Neneh , 2020 ; Bui Ngoc Tuan and Pham , 2022 ; Muammar and Maker , 2022 ) . In higher education , entrepreneurial groups come from two categories : students from general higher education and students from higher vocational education . Compared with students from general higher education , students from higher vocational education are more inclined to choose to start a business after graduation ( Mahmood et al . , 2018 ; Phraudomsitthinayok , 2019 ) . The main reasons are as follows : Firstly , the students cultivated by vocational colleges meet the needs of technical talents due to industrial upgrading and economic structural adjustment . The application - oriented is more prominent , and the practical operation ability is stronger than that of undergraduate students ( Younis et al . , 2020 ) . Secondly , vocational college students have specific vocational skills as well as a solid knowledge foundation and entrepreneurial potential . They are more willing to change their situation compared with highly educated people , which often urges them to consider entrepreneurship . Although governments at all levels have issued a series of preferential policies to encourage students to participate in entrepreneurship ( Neneh , 2020 ) . Vocational colleges also carry out various entrepreneurial education to teach students entrepreneurial knowledge and skills training to improve students’ entrepreneurial intention . However , students with high entrepreneurial intention still account for a very small number . According to the entrepreneurship report of Chinese college students , 7 . 7 % of vocational college graduates choose flexible employment , of which only 3 . 1 % choose entrepreneurship ( Sciences , 2022 ) . On the one hand , the reason for this phenomenon is that the entrepreneurial process is full of difficulties and uncertainties . A large number of data show that the failure rate of start - ups in 5 years is as high as 67 % ( Svotwa et al . , 2022 ) . On the other hand , it is due to the lack of experience and knowledge accumulation of entrepreneurs ( Wach and Bilan , 2021 ) . Therefore , a better understanding of the factors that affect individual entrepreneurial intentions can improve students’ entrepreneurial intentions so as to speed up the entrepreneurial process . As a result of entrepreneurship as the primary impetus for the expansion of the economy , research in entrepreneurship is currently attracting a significant amount of attention from academics and researchers ( Phraudomsitthinayok , 2019 ; Guerrero et al . , 2020 ; Anjum et al . , 2020c ) . In recent years , scholars have studied entrepreneurial intention from different perspectives ( Wach and Bilan , 2021 ; Huang et al . , 2022 ; Abdelfattah et al . , 2022a ) . For example , Anjum et al . ( 2020b ) explore the influence of perceived creativity disposition on entrepreneurial attitude and entrepreneurial intention based on the theory of planned behavior . In addition , it also analyzes the moderating mechanism of university support on perceived creativity disposition and entrepreneurial intention . Some scholars study entrepreneurial intention based on social cognitive theory . Neneh ( 2020 ) takes self - efficacy as a key predictive variable affecting entrepreneurial intention and discusses how entrepreneurial passion and social support affect entrepreneurial intention through entrepreneurial self - efficacy . At the same time , numerous studies conducted recently concentrated on the ways in which individual characteristics , such as cognitive elements , can inspire entrepreneurial intention ( Mahmood et al . , 2018 ; Munir et al . , 2019 ; Tariq et al . , 2021 ) . The cognitive elements enable people to identify and seize opportunities for entrepreneurship . In this context , the cognitive perspective of entrepreneurship sheds light on the importance of creativity . Researchers have acknowledged the significance of creativity as a factor in determining whether or not they would carry out entrepreneurial activities ( Shi et al . , 2020 ; Mickiewicz and Kaasa , 2022 ; Abdelfattah et al . , 2022b ) . Literature indicates that a creative individual will most probably engage in entrepreneurial activities ( Mahmood et al . , 2018 ; Anjum et al . , 2020b ) . However , further research is needed to determine whether creativity will affect the entrepreneurial intentions of students in vocational colleges . The models of behavioral intention have been successfully utilized to predict future behavior for both managers and policymakers in social psychology research ( Wach et al . , 2016 ) . In addition , the theory of planned behavior ( TPB ) constitutes the most frequently used model in the study of entrepreneurial intentions . The aim of this study is to explore the impacts of creativity on entrepreneurial intention by applying the TPB model . While other scholars have explored links between students’ creativity and entrepreneurial intentions , the innovations of this study are as follows : Firstly , creativity adopts a second - order formative construct and conceptualizes it into a multidimensional dimension ( Zampetakis et al . , 2011 ) . This is because individual creativity is affected by the surrounding environment in the process of entrepreneurship , such as family and university ( Rosique - Blasco et al . , 2018 ) . Secondly , this study has also emphasized how important it is to take into account the Niu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1021969 Frontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin . org interactions between individual and environmental elements . For instance , the inclusion of social support in the entrepreneurial intention model adds a new dimension of exploration for the personal traits of entrepreneurs . Thirdly , since entrepreneurial activities are inherently risky , this study hypothesizes whether risk propensity ( RP ) moderates the relationship between creativity and entrepreneurial intention . Finally , relationships are examined between creativity and entrepreneurial intentions drawing on the TPB , both directly and as mediated by attitudes toward entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial self - efficacy . This study focuses on answering the following research questions : ( 1 ) What are the entrepreneurial factors that affect vocational college students ? And which factor has the greatest impact on entrepreneurial intention ? ( 2 ) This study estimates the role of creativity and social support in the formation of entrepreneurial intentions . Are they direct antecedents of intentions , or are their effects mediated by attitudes and self - efficacy ? ( 3 ) Sometimes , even people with high creativity still have no intention of participating in entrepreneurial activities . Can risk propensity help transform creativity into entrepreneurial intention ? The remaining portions of this article are described below . In the second section of this study , several hypotheses about the direct , indirect , and moderating effects of creativity and social support on entrepreneurial intention are justified and proposed . The third section lays down the methodology adopted to accomplish the stated research objectives . Next , we detail our findings based on information gathered from a representative sample of 500 students enrolled in vocational colleges . In the fifth part of this study , we summarize our findings as well as the implications for both theory and practice . The last section provides insights about the limitations and direction for future research . Literature review Theory of planned behavior Ajzen ( 1991 ) put forward the theory of planned behavior on the basis of the theory of rational behavior ( Ajzen and Fishbein , 1980 ) . Multiple studies have applied theory of planned behavior ( TPB ) theory to analyze individual behavior in diverse relationships . For TPB , behavioral intention is the primary predictor that makes it easier to measure and assess behavior . According to TPB , three proximal dimensions that can influence behavior intention are the subjective norm , perceived behavioral control , and attitude . In order to more effectively explain behaviors , researchers frequently use the altered TPB model with the appropriate variable substitution or addition depending on each research scenario ( Boudreaux et al . , 2019 ) . However , numerous scholars have found a non - significant direct relationship between subjective norms and entrepreneurial intentions ( Esfandiar et al . , 2019 ) . This may be due to the fact that subjective norms have a marginal impact on the entrepreneurial intentions of individuals who possess great internal control ( Icek Ajzen , 2002 ) . Therefore , the variable is not considered in this study . Furthermore , perceived behavioral control is defined as the perceived ease or difficulty of performing a particular behavior ( Ajzen , 1991 ) . However , self - efficacy can take the place of perceived behavior control when explaining behavioral intentions ( Armitage and Conner , 2001 ) . Wach and Bilan ( 2021 ) argue that these two concepts are equivalent and reciprocal interchange . Therefore , we use self - efficacy to replace perceived behavior control in this research . Entrepreneurial intention Entrepreneurial intention ( EI ) , first proposed by Bird ( 1988 ) , refers to the mental state of individuals when setting entrepreneurial goals . Scholars have had a long - standing interest in trying to understand the factors that contribute to entrepreneurial behavior . EI is the best predictor of entrepreneurial action as it precedes any attempt at entrepreneurial behavior ( Anjum et al . , 2020c ) . The study of EI is a rapidly developing area of research ( Tariq et al . , 2021 ; Wach and Bilan , 2021 ; Abdelfattah et al . , 2022a ) . Research on EI can deepen people’s understanding of entrepreneurial cognition and behavior patterns . This study defines EI as individual’s psychological tendency to carry out entrepreneurial activities . It is the product of the interaction between individuals and the environment . Starting from personal personalities or the external environment , researchers have explored various factors that may lead to EI and studied its influence mechanisms , such as entrepreneurial personalities ( Liu et al . , 2021 ; Munir et al . , 2021 ; Bui Ngoc Tuan and Pham , 2022 ) , cognitive factors ( Neneh , 2020 ; Mickiewicz and Kaasa , 2022 ; Abdelfattah et al . , 2022b ) , environment elements ( Wn et al . , 2020 ; Hossain et al . , 2021 ; Bui Ngoc Tuan and Pham , 2022 ) . According to the findings of the researchers , these factors have an indirect impact on the intentions of individuals by influencing their attitudes or self - efficacy ( Hossain et al . , 2021 ; Liang et al . , 2021 ; Westhuizen and Awotunde , 2021 ) . Social support Social support ( SS ) refers to obtaining substantial , emotional , and informational help from others when an individual is in need . It can be roughly categorized into three dimensions : emotional support ; tangible support ( e . g . , financial assistance ) ; and informational support ( e . g . , sharing valuable knowledge ) . Each of these three dimensions is described in detail . “Emotional support” ( ES ) is an intangible type of support received from one’s social network ( Farooq , 2016 ) . Taylor ( 2011 ) claimed that “emotional support” is a feeling of being cared for and a warm feeling of having positive recognition from one’s social network . The term “tangible support” ( TS ) is used by Farooq ( 2018 ) to characterize all of the concrete and direct ways in which people can help others , Niu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1021969 Frontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin . org such as practical action and material support . According to Farooq ( 2016 ) , more than half of all entrepreneurs give up on their business plans each year because they lack adequate resources and financial backing . Farooq ( 2018 ) described “information support” ( IS ) as an effective way to provide advice to entrepreneurs who are having trouble . If entrepreneurs do not have access to rich information or previous work experience , it is difficult for them to make accurate judgments ( Farooq , 2016 ) . As a result , obtaining informational help at the earliest stages of entrepreneurship is of the utmost significance for entrepreneurs ( Markovic et al . , 2017 ) . These three factors are also taken into account by Huang et al . ( 2022 ) in a newly released study to evaluate the importance of SS and technology product imagination disposition in predicting individuals’ internet EI . Alzamel et al . ( 2020a ) studied the impact of SS on females’ EI and the results showed that SS comprised of family and peers has a significant influence on entrepreneurial capability among females . Furthermore , Farooq ( 2018 ) considered that entrepreneurial behavior requires more support ( such as financial support , human resources , information support , etc . ) than any other behavior . Creativity ( IC ) This study conceptualizes creativity as the driving force behind entrepreneurship as a way to explain how innovation promotes economic growth ( Ng Kim - Soon and Mostafa , 2022 ) . In the past , creativity was thought of as a characteristic of a person’s personality . However , recent research has highlighted the fact that creativity is the product of human interaction ( Munir et al . , 2021 ) . Hence , the interplay between the environment and an entrepreneur can be a source of entrepreneurial creativity ( Runco , 2014 ; Kusmintarti et al . , 2017 ) . For example , some studies highlight the role of the family in influencing individuals’ creativity and shaping EI ( Zampetakis et al . , 2011 ; Munir et al . , 2021 ) . Family creativity ( FCRE ) is thought as a personality feature , and it claims that an individual’s creativity is influenced by the environment in which they grow up ( Zampetakis et al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore , the term “creative university environment” ( UCRE ) refers to the atmosphere at universities that fosters and encourages individual innovation ( Amabile et al . , 1996 ) . Other scholars believe that educational environments have an impact on young people’s creativity . For instance , Muammar and Maker ( 2022 ) emphasize the influence of teachers’ characteristics and behaviors on students’ creativity . In addition , scholars agree that creative role models in school are conducive to influencing students’ creativity ( Mickiewicz and Kaasa , 2022 ) . The literature on creativity shows that creativity is an essential component of the entrepreneurial process ( Anjum et al . , 2018 , 2020d ; Rungsrisawata and Sutdueanb , 2019 ) . For instance , Munir et al . ( 2021 ) ‘s study is underpinned by the “personal abilities - intention based framework” by employing the integrated role of personal abilities ( creativity and self - confidence ) and the theory of planned behavior ( TPB ) , finding a positive link between IC and EI . Mahmood et al . ( 2018 ) assert that entrepreneurs have a greater propensity for creativity than non - entrepreneurs do . Individuals with high creativity can maintain a positive attitude and high self - confidence toward entrepreneurial activities and think in novel and unconventional ways . Anjum et al . ( 2020b ) introduce creativity into the EI model , estimating the positive relationship between perceived creativity disposition on entrepreneurial attitude and intentions . Risk propensity It is inevitable that entrepreneurs will encounter unknown risks in the process of entrepreneurship . Risk propensity refers to the psychological characteristics of individuals who take the initiative to cope with or avoid risks ( Sitkin and Weingart , 1995 ) . The emotional and mental aspects of people who drive their entrepreneurial activities are highlighted in psychological theories of entrepreneurship . According to locus of control theory proposed by Julian Rotter in 1954 , it manages to explain that entrepreneurs with internals locus believe that emergence of success is due to their capabilities and actions . Risk - taking is the most elementary action that entrepreneurs do to achieve high - level performance and success ( Brockhaus , 1980 ) . Bodill and Roberts ( 2013 ) points that individuals who have a high RP are more likely to choose high - risk entrepreneurial activities to achieve their goals because of the high profitability associated with such activities . Otherwise , they will give up entrepreneurship ( Golik , 2018 ) . In addition , the higher the individual’s risk tendency , the more likely it is to underestimate the risk in some cases , thereby reducing their perception of risk ( Ward et al . , 2019 ) . Some literatures have introduced the variable of risk propensity to study the influencing factors of EI ( Golik , 2018 ; Gu et al . , 2018 ; Hussain et al . , 2021 ) . Gu et al . ( 2018 ) point out that individuals who make entrepreneurial choices have a higher risk preference than ordinary people . When facing the same entrepreneurial opportunities , they are more willing to pursue risks to obtain greater benefits and a sense of achievement and satisfaction . In addition , Hussain et al . ( 2021 ) propose that RP affects entrepreneurial self - efficacy and then affects the EI . At the same time , he considers that individuals with high - risk tendencies can obtain positive incentives even in an unknown environment , which has a positive impact on EI . Entrepreneurial self - efficacy According to Chen et al . ( 1998 ) , self - efficacy refers to a person’s belief in one’s own abilities to attain desired outcomes , which has a tremendous impact on an individual’s thoughts , feelings , and behavior . In the context of research on entrepreneurship , entrepreneurial self - efficacy ( ESE ) refers to the degree to which an individual believes in his or her skills and capabilities to successfully complete the duties necessary Niu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1021969 Frontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin . org for entrepreneurship ( H . Zhao et al . , 2005 ; McGee et al . , 2009 ) . More and more attention is being paid to the importance of ESE in the prediction of EI . A variety of models have been extended and adjusted to incorporate self - efficacy as a major factor in determining whether or not an individual intends to engage in entrepreneurial activity ( Ahmed et al . , 2020 ; Urban , 2020 ; Liang et al . , 2021 ; Westhuizen and Awotunde , 2021 ) . For example , Sandi and Nurhayati ( 2020 ) took self - efficacy as a key antecedent to influencing EI and explored how factors such as entrepreneurship education and family environment affected the formation of EI by influencing ESE . The empirical results illustrated that self - efficacy has a significant impact on the interest of student entrepreneurship . Entrepreneurial attitude “Entrepreneurial attitude ( Ate ) ” refers to the general views of students on entrepreneurial behavior . It is a subjective judgment and an internal motivation for a person to choose to engage in entrepreneurship ( Robinson et al . , 1991 ) . To a large extent , people’s attitudes determine whether or not they would engage in a particular behavior , as stated by Hgg and Gabrielsson ( 2019 ) ( e . g . , entrepreneurial activities in this study ) . When something is labeled “good for me , ” it will produce a positive attitude , while when something is labeled “bad for me , ” it will produce a negative attitude ( Kusmintarti et al . , 2017 ) . Attitude , as an important determinant of intention , has appeared in many literatures ( Wn et al . , 2020 ; Anjum et al . , 2020d , 2022 ) . For example , Anjum et al . ( 2022 ) constructed the EI model by taking ATT as an important antecedent variable of EI based on the theory of planned behavior and pointed out that ATT has a significant impact on EI . The research results of Wn et al . ( 2020 ) also support this view ; that is , students who have a positive attitude toward entrepreneurship are more likely to start businesses in the future . Hypotheses Social support and entrepreneurial intention Previous studies identified SS as an essential determinant of EI ( Kruse et al . , 2020 ; Muhammed et al . , 2020 ; Alzamel et al . , 2020b ; Hossain et al . , 2021 ) . For example , Hossain et al . ( 2021 ) consider that when entrepreneurs get good social support , they will be satisfied with their entrepreneurial environment and interpersonal relationships so as to stimulate their EI . Akter et al . ( 2020 ) discover that a socially supportive environment not only improves EI but also prepares the route toward for individuals who are just beginning their entrepreneurial journey . According to Wn et al . ( 2020 ) , entrepreneurship is a social activity that calls for significantly more frequent interaction with one’s surrounding social environment than any other activity . As a result of these justifications , the following hypothesis can be posited : H1 : SS has a significant impact on EI . Social support and entrepreneurial self - efficacy SS can enhance self - efficacy to a certain extent . Younis et al . ( 2020 ) hold that a lack of social support may contribute to increased anxiety and a lower sense of psychological well - being . This may be a vicious cycle . Neneh ( 2020 ) also proposes that SS can help entrepreneurs cope with the challenges in the process of entrepreneurship and enhance their sense of security and confidence , which in turn improves their self - efficacy . Hence , it is hypothesized in this study that : H2 : SS has a significant impact on ESE . Social support and entrepreneurial self - efficacy Entrepreneurship is a complex process . Some scholars consider that the social support provided by the outside world to entrepreneurs can reduce the psychological anxiety of entrepreneurship . These supports can boost college students’ self - confidence and face the difficulties encountered in the future with an optimistic attitude . Therefore , social support can enable entrepreneurs to take a positive attitude toward entrepreneurial prospects ( Anjum et al . , 2022 ; Bakar et al . , 2022 ; Bui Ngoc Tuan and Pham , 2022 ) . On the basis of these findings , the following hypothesis is posited : H3 : SS has a significant impact on ATE . Creativity and entrepreneurial intention There is a direct effect of creativity on EI . When people dedicate themselves to activities related to entrepreneurship rather than working for someone else , the returns from creativity are anticipated to be higher ( Batchelor and Burch , 2012 ; Anjum et al . , 2020a ) . A growing body of research underlines the relationship between entrepreneurship and creativity ( Hu et al . , 2018 ; Murad et al . , 2021 ; Wang et al . , 2021 ; Abdelfattah et al . , 2022b ) . For example , the existing body of research backs up the assertion that creative individuals could have greater EI than uncreative individuals ( Anjum et al . , 2020d ) . Ndofirepi ( 2018 ) further demonstrates that different dimensions of creativity have diverse effects on EI . Murad et al . ( 2021 ) have indicated that the relationship between creativity and EI is indirect and will be influenced by Niu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1021969 Frontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin . org a third factor . Based on these arguments , this study proposes the following hypotheses : H4 : IC has a significant impact on EI . Creativity and entrepreneurial attitude The research conducted by Frank et al . ( 2007 ) demonstrates that personal characteristics ( such as creativity ) are the key to the origins of entrepreneurial behavior . People who possess a particular quality will likely feel more at ease engaging in activities that require that quality or imagining themselves conducting these activities ( Muammar and Maker , 2022 ; Abdelfattah et al . , 2022a ) . Thus , it seems that those individuals who are more creative have a more positive attitude toward entrepreneurship . For all these reasons , this study proposes the following hypothesis : H5 : IC has a significant impact on ATE . Creativity and entrepreneurial self - efficacy As far as creativity is concerned , there is a growing literature examining relationships between creativity and ATE ( Mahmood et al . , 2018 ; Laguía et al . , 2019 ; Anjum et al . , 2020d ) . According to Mahmood et al . ( 2018 ) , open - mindedness and the ability to break free of preconceptions are two of the characteristics of creativity that can help entrepreneurs gain creative confidence . For those with high creative confidence , self - efficacy will be higher and the possibility of entrepreneurial success will be greater . For this reason , the study chooses to test the following hypothesis : H6 : IC has a significant impact on ESE . Entrepreneurial self - efficacy and entrepreneurial intention Perceived behavior control in TPB can be replaced by self - efficacy ( SEF ) when explaining behavioral intentions ( Armitage and Conner , 2001 ) . According to Akter et al . ( 2020 ) , people with a high level of self - efficacy have great effectiveness and strategic flexibility in their entrepreneurial success , which will positively affect their EI and dare to bear the risk of entrepreneurial failure . In addition , an individual who has a high level of self - efficacy is better able to anticipate difficulties that can prevent them from achieving their specified goals ( Westhuizen and Awotunde , 2021 ) . In contrast to those who have low self - efficacy and believe they will constantly be wary of new environments , those who have a high level of self - efficacy are more likely to react positively to emerging situations ( Li et al . , 2020a , b ) . Indeed , several empirical studies have found self - efficacy to have a direct influence on entrepreneurial intention ( Hsu et al . , 2018 ; Ren et al . , 2018 ; Neneh , 2020 ) . So , it is hypothesized that : H7 : ESE has a significant impact on EI . Entrepreneurial attitude and entrepreneurial intention According to Ajzen ( 1991 ) , attitude refers to personal beliefs , which is the degree to which the individual likes or dislikes the outcomes that their behavior produces . From the perspective of students , ATE is the degree to which students desire or do not desire to engage in entrepreneurial behaviors . Many researchers have also explored the positive relationship between ATE and EI ( Jena , 2020 ; Anjum et al . , 2022 ; Bakar et al . , 2022 ; Svotwa et al . , 2022 ) . The meta - analysis of entrepreneurship literature conducted by Hazarika et al . ( 2020 ) also indicates that ATE has the strongest predictive potential for EI , accounting for more than half of the total variance . Valencia - Arias et al . ( 2021 ) point out that although ATE is comprised of various motivations and varies depending on the individual , its impact on EI can be universal . Based on the literature , the following hypothesis is posited : H8 : ATE has a significant impact on EI . The role of the theory of planned behavior According to the TPB , attitudes , subjective norms , and self - efficacy provide the most substantial information about a behavior’s determinants . Whereas other background factors like personality , demographics ( such as age , gender , and education ) , and other information sources may indirectly affect EI through one or more of these elements ( Ajzen , 2011 ) . Accordingly , creativity and social support are expected to relate indirectly to EI through ATE and ESE . Mediating effects of entrepreneurial self - efficacy Students may have higher levels of ESE if they are more creative , which may lead them to believe that engaging in entrepreneurial behavior is simpler for them . If students are unable to see their own creative potential , it is possible that they may have less confidence in their ability to effectively complete such activities and view a career in entrepreneurship as being less attainable . Recent studies have shown that in addition to the direct effect of creativity on EI , this relationship is also mediated by self - efficacy ( Bello et al . , 2018 ; Mahmood et al . , 2018 ; Kumar and Shukla , 2019 ) . Kumar and Shukla ( 2019 ) identify creativity Niu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1021969 Frontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin . org and active personality as the two leading factors of EI when studying the EI of management students . The results show that the impact of creativity on EI is partially mediated by ESE , which means that creativity does not completely affect EI . Similarly , Rosique - Blasco et al . ( 2018 ) and Laguía et al . ( 2019 ) also find self - efficacy as a significant determinant in mediating creativity and EI . Given the above discussion , the hypothesis is formulated as follows : H9a : The relationship between IC and EI will be mediated by ESE . Similarly , ESE has been selected as a potential mediator of SS and EI . Researchers argue that the support provided by universities or families enhances the self - efficacy of individuals , thereby improving their EI ( Mei et al . , 2017 ; Xu et al . , 2020 ; Gm and Klk , 2021 ) . In addition , Shi et al . ( 2019 ) recognize the role of ESE as a mediator of the positive relationship between SS and EI . Similarly , this result has been confirmed by more studies ( Saeed et al . , 2014 ; Schmitt et al . , 2018 ; Neneh , 2020 ) . Hence , the hypothesis is proposed : H9b : The relationship between SS and EI will be mediated by ESE . Mediating effect of entrepreneurial attitude Krugger ( 2009 ) believes that the antecedents that influence EI are indirect . These antecedents first influence one’s attitude and then affect EI . In this study , antecedents include SS and CI . According to the results of several studies ( Farrukh et al . , 2018 ; Anjum et al . , 2020b ) , creativity influences EI through attitude . Anjum et al . ( 2019 ) consider that students who are self - assured , capable of creative thought , and have a positive outlook on the possibility of starting their own business have a greater possibility of devoting themselves to the field . As a result , attitude can function as a proximal predictor of EI , whereas creativity can function as a more distant antecedent . The following hypothesis is offered : H9c : The relationship between IC and EI will be mediated by ATE . Farooq ( 2018 ) argues that SS has an indirect effect on EI of individuals . Namely , SS directly effects the ATE , which , later on , positively affects EI . Students can increase their positive attitude toward entrepreneurship and their recognition of their entrepreneurial identity with the help of the external environment . In addition , Younis et al . ( 2020 ) also show similar results : ATE plays a mediating role between SS and EI . Hence , this study hypothesis that : H9d : The relationship between SS and EI will be mediated by ATE . Moderating effect of risk propensity Some studies point out that RP moderates the relationship between creativity and EI ( Gu et al . , 2018 ; Samydevan et al . , 2020 ; Hussain et al . , 2021 ) . In our model , this study views RP as the moderating mechanism relating creativity to EI . That is , people with higher risk propensity have higher creativity , and then have higher EI . Gu et al . ( 2018 ) propose that high - risk propensity individuals tend to adopt innovative ways to solve problems in the process of entrepreneurship , which is conducive to stimulating individual creativity and improving the success rate of entrepreneurship . Individuals with low - risk propensity tend to adopt traditional and error - prone methods to deal with difficulties , which inhibits the development of individual creativity and weakens individual EI . Based on the above analysis , the following hypothesis can be proposed : H10 : The relationship between IC and EI will be moderated by RP . A conceptual framework based on the theory of planned behavior is thus constructed on the basis of the above discussion and hypotheses . All hypotheses and latent variables are presented in the conceptual model in Figure 1 . Materials and methods Participants In this study , students from seven public and private vocational colleges in different provinces of China were selected as the samples . Online questionnaires were distributed through WeChat , QQ , email , and other platforms . The participants were asked to fill in a self - reported questionnaire designed to collect the data needed to test the theoretical framework proposed . The questionnaire is filled in anonymously to ensure its authenticity . Influenced by the policy , the government encourages vocational colleges to implement flexible educational systems , allowing students to adjust their academic process or suspend their studies for entrepreneurship . Therefore , this study is not only a survey of graduates but also a survey of students of all grades in vocational colleges and their intention to enter into entrepreneurship . The questionnaires were distributed and collected from June to July 2022 . The random sampling method was used to proportionally distribute the questionnaires according to the actual number of students in each discipline . At the same time , the original samples were screened on the basis of accuracy and authenticity : on the basis of the number of questionnaires , the questionnaires were excluded if they were filled in less than 100 s . Ten consecutive questionnaires with the same answer were excluded . Finally , a list of 500 respondents was obtained , and 16 invalid questionnaires were eliminated , with a valid questionnaire rate of 96 . 90 % . Therefore , the sample is representative and can effectively represent the characteristics of all students .

From the data in Table 1 , it can be concluded that there were slightly more males among the respondents , accounting for about 69 . 0 % of the respondents ; 31 . 0 % of the respondents were women . The vast majority of them are students majoring in Social Sciences ( 47 . 2 % ) and freshmen ( 50 . 4 % ) . Based on the recommendations of Hair ( 2009 ) , the sample size should be 15 – 20 observations per variable for generalizability purposes . The total number of variables in this study was five . A sample size of more than 100 meets the requirements . The effective sample size collected in this study was 500 . Therefore , the sample size was considered adequate ( Hair et al . , 2021 ) . Measurement The design of the questionnaire is a key element in the research process because it ultimately influences the collection of data ( Sarstedt et al . , 2019 ) . This research questionnaire is divided into two sections . The first section consists of the respondents’ demographic profiles . The second section consists of independent variables and dependent variables . This study uses those as a basis for its measurements since earlier studies have developed accurate and reliable scales . To make it easier for respondents to convey their opinions , all responses are collected on a five - point Likert scale from 1 ( strongly disagree ) , 2 ( disagree ) , 3 ( neutral ) , 4 ( agree ) , and 5 ( strongly agree ) . The complete scale used in this study is shown in Table 2 . Creativity is a second - order formative construct . In this study , it is classified into three dimensions : personal creativity ( PCRE ) , creativity supported in the family ( FCRE ) , and creativity supported in the university ( UCRE ) . The three dimensions of creativity have different scales : The scales of FCRE are inherited from Miller and Gerard ( 1979 ) with three items for each scale ; the UCRE is measured by three items that are adapted from Amabile et al . ( 1996 ) ; the survey items used to measure PCRE for this study have been adapted from Zhou and George ( 2001 ) . Social support is a second - order reflective construct . It includes three first - order latent variables : informational support ( IS ) , tangible support ( TS ) , and emotional support ( ES ) . To measure social support , this study used a scale modified from Krause and Markides ( 1990 ) ’s study . FIGURE 1 Conceptual framework . TABLE 1 Demographic information of the sample .

Finally , a five - item scale of ATE adapted from Farrukh et al . ( 2019 ) is used . TABLE 2 Survey instrument .

The technique is a powerful component - based method widely used in prior studies ( Xu et al . , 2020 ; Wang et al . , 2021 ; Mickiewicz and Kaasa , 2022 ; Sciences , 2022 ) . This method of estimation is suitable for this study for various reasons : ( 1 ) complex modeling including multiple mediators ( Cepeda et al . , 2018 ) ; ( 2 ) analyzing both reflective and formative measurement constructs in one model ( David and Ketchen , 2013 ) ; ( 3 ) the estimation of formative measurement constructs without limitations ( Henseler et al . , 2009 ) ; ( 4 ) investigating complex relationships that combine mediating and moderating effects ( Fornell et al . , 1982 ) ; ( 5 ) second - order formative ( i . e . , creativity ) and reflective ( i . e . , social support ) multidimensional construct . A detailed description of the data analysis findings is given in the next section . Results The assessment of the measurement model This study’s conceptual model includes both formative and reflective measurement constructs . Out of six total variables , one variable ( i . e . , creativity ) is a formative measurement construct , and five variables ( i . e . , ATT , ESE , SS , RP , and EI ) are reflective measurement constructs . Statistical evaluation criteria for reflective measurement constructs are different from formative measurement constructs ( Hair et al . , 2017 ) . Accordingly , both reflective and formative measurement constructs are examined , respectively , in this study . Because a formative measurement scale’s items are likely to represent an independent cause and are not necessarily highly correlated with one another , the concept of internal consistency is inappropriate ( Chin , 1998 ) . Reflective measurement scale items must be correlated and should depict significant outer loadings ( Hair et al . , 2017 ) . Assessment of reflective measurement constructs This study evaluates the internal consistency ( reliability ) and validity of constructs for the reflective measurement model . The internal consistency ( reliability ) is measured by the composite reliability ( CR ) and Cronbach’s alpha ( CA ) . The value of CA shall be at least greater than 0 . 7 . The CR values of 0 . 70 and 0 . 90 can be regarded as satisfactory . The CR values of more than 0 . 90 are deemed undesirable because this indicate “they are measuring the same phenomenon and are therefore unlikely to be a valid measure of the construct” ( Hair , 2014 ) . The results in Table 3 show all the values of CA and CR of the latent variables meet the requirements ( Fornell and Larcker , 1981 ) , indicating that the internal consistency of all the constructs is supported . The assessment of indicator reliability is done by testing the outer loadings of each indicator on its own latent variable , and the evaluated value is compared with the threshold value . The results in Tables 3 , 4 demonstrate the reliability of the constructs involved in our proposed conceptual model . A two - step approach is performed to validate the construct validity : the convergent validity and the discriminant validity . It is required to test the convergent validity of the data to determine whether the items represent a particular construct ( Urbach and Ahlemann , 2010 ) . Convergent validity at the construct level is established using the average variance extracted ( AVE ; Fong and Law , 2013 ; Tehseen et al . , 2017 ) . As per the results , all values of AVE range from 0 . 646 to 0 . 843 , which is acceptable and higher than the threshold critical level of 0 . 5 ( Fornell and Larcker , 1981 ) . Hence , its results demonstrate the convergent validity of reflective measurement models . Discriminant validity is the extent to which a construct is truly distinct from other constructs ( Hair , 2014 ) . The test for discriminant validity of reflective constructs is performed by evaluating the cross - loadings of constructs’ indicators ( Hair Hult TABLE 4 Reliability and validity of second - order reflective constructs . Construct CA CR AVE Social support 0 . 976 0 . 881 0 . 752 TABLE 3 The reliability and validity of the first - order reflective constructs .

Niu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1021969 Frontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin . org et al . , 2016 ) . For the cross - loadings , indicators should have the highest loading on their own latent construct as compared to other variables involved in the model . Since the model in this study contains second - order constructs , the cross - loading of first - order reflective constructs ( IS , ES , TS ) is tested first . Then , the cross - loading of structural model constructs is calculated . The complete list of cross - loadings of all indicators of each construct is presented in Tables 5 , 6 . Hence , these findings meet the cross - loadings evaluation criteria and provide satisfactory evidence for the discriminant validity of the reflective measurement models . As can be observed , all of the requirements for model evaluation have been satisfied , which lends support to the model’s reliability and validity . Then , the discussion continues with the assessment of formative constructs involved in this study . Assessment of formative measurement constructs Reflective - formative higher order construct modeling is widely used in the PLS - SEM approach . According to Sarstedt et al . ( 2019 ) , reflecting - formative type models are frequently specified using a two - stage approach . First , it gets the latent variable score ( LVS ) by estimating the first - order dimensions without the second - order construct in the model . Then , in the second stage of analysis , these LVS are used to measure the second - order formative construct ( Wilson , 2010 ; Jan - Michael et al . , 2012 ) . This study modeled “creativity” as a reflective - formative construct ; it has three lower - order constructs ( LOC ) : PCRE , FCRE , and UCRE . Formative constructs are evaluated differently than reflective constructs ( Chin , 1998 ; Leguina , 2015 ; Henseler et al . , 2016 ) . All formative measurement constructs are likely to indicate an independent cause for the latent variable and have a low correlation among measurement scale items . Consequently , for the formative measurement constructs , this study analyzes the convergent validity , collinearity issues , and the weights of the formative indicators . In formative measurement constructs , the computation for convergent validity is also performed differently ( Chin , 1998 ; Leguina , 2015 ) . As mentioned in the previous section , this study involves a formative construct ( i . e . , creativity ) . In order to establish convergent validity , this study has to test whether the formative construct is highly correlated with a reflective measure of the same construct ( i . e . , IC formative → IC reflective ) . According to the rule of thumb , ideally , the correlation value between Y formative → Y reflective should be 0 . 80 or higher for determining the convergent validity of the formative construct ( Chin , 1998 ; Leguina , 2015 ) . Results in Figure 2 demonstrate that IC formative → IC reflective ’s path coefficient value is 0 . 771 , close to the threshold of 0 . 80 , which is acceptable for this study . Thus , the formative measurement construct ( i . e . , creativity ) has an acceptable degree of convergent validity . TABLE 6 The cross - loadings of construct .

Niu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1021969 Frontiers in Psychology 12 frontiersin . org An important concern with formative construct is the level of multi - collinearity across formative sub - dimensions . Collinearity refers to the high correlation between two formative indicators . High levels of collinearity between formative indicators are a crucial issue because they have an impact on the estimation of weights and their statistical significance . Validation of variance inflation factor ( VIF ) values , which should be lower than 5 , is used to check the collinearity issue of constructs ( Hair and Sarstedt . , 2011 ) . The results in Table 7 indicate that all VIF values are less than 5 . Therefore , the collinearity issue is not present between constructs . Outer weights in formative measurement models should be analyzed for their significance and relevance only if collinearity is not at a critical level ( Diamantopoulos et al . , 2008 ) . The weight is similar to the path coefficient and explains the effect of each dimension on the formative construct . The significance of the weights confirms the significance and relevance of the multidimensional construct of creativity . Findings in Table 8 demonstrate that the weights of all the two indicators of creativity are significant . Hence , the significant weights made it possible for creativity to have more than one dimension and be studied further . Based on what we have talked about so far , it is also clear that the applicability of formative constructs has also been established , and the overall assessment of formative measurement models has shown acceptable results to proceed with the evaluation of the structural model .

For the structural model , this study analyzes the significance of the path coefficients , collinearity assessment , coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) , the predictive relevance ( Q 2 ) , and absolute model fit indices . Collinearity assessment The same measure used in the evaluation of formative measurement models is used in this study to evaluate collinearity . As per the rule of thumb , if the variance inflation factor ( VIF ) values in the study model are less than 5 , it indicates that the study model does not have a covariance problem ( Hair et al . , 2017 ) . Table 7 shows that the variance inflation factor ( VIF ) values for all the constructs range from 1 . 516 to 3 . 554 , which is below the suggested threshold value of 5 . This means that the model estimates do not have a multicollinearity bias and the results of the study model are relatively stable . Coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) The coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) is a measure of the model’s predictive accuracy and represents the exogenous latent variables’ combined effects on the endogenous latent variable . The R 2 is classified as 0 . 25 ( weak ) , 0 . 50 ( moderate ) and 0 . 75 ( substantial ; Hair Black et al . , 2010 ) . The R 2 values shown in Table 9 range from 0 . 578 to 0 . 739 , indicating that the model’s fit is satisfactory . The present study has an R 2 value of 0 . 739 for EI , which demonstrates that the dependent variable is influenced by the independent variables by 73 . 90 % . The R 2 values indicate that the proposed conceptual model has adequate explanatory power . Predictive relevance ( Q 2 ) According to Hair et al . ( 2017 ) , it is not sufficient to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the model only based on the R 2 value . Hence , this research uses the Stone - Geisser’s ( Geisser , 1974 ; Stone , 1974 ) Q 2 test for evaluating the predictive relevance of a structural model by using the blindfolding procedure . If the Q 2 value is larger than zero , it indicates that the structural model’s latent exogenous constructs have predictive relevance for latent endogenous constructs ( Chin , 2010 ) . As shown in Table 10 , Q 2 values range from 0 . 355 to 0 . 620 , indicating all latent underlying endogenous constructs involved in this study have strong predictive relevance . Absolute model fit indices A good - fitting measurement model is necessary before interpreting the structural model’s causal paths . The fit of the model is evaluated using the standardized root mean square error ( SRMR ) in this study . The SRMR is an absolute measure of fit , which is defined as the standardized difference between the observed correlation and the predicted correlations ( Henseler et al . , 2016 ) . A good fit is generally considered to be less than 0 . 08 ( Hu and Bentler , 1999 ) . The SRMR value is 0 . 065 in this research , which is lower than 0 . 08 . Consequently , the fitting degree of the model is acceptable ( Table 11 ) . Hypotheses test The analysis of the measurement model and the structural model indicates that the proposed theoretical model is fit to proceed with hypothesis testing . Path coefficient values and t - values suggest different levels of support for hypotheses proposed in the structural model of this study ( David and Ketchen , 2013 ) . Findings of the structural model demonstrate that , except a comparatively weak negative of creativity and EI , all other hypothesized path relations are positive and significant . H1 predict a positive relationship between SS and EI , hence supported at p < 0 . 001 . The relationship between SS and ESE ( H2 ) is also accepted ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Hypothesis relation between SS and ATE ( H3 ) is found to be fairly significant and positive ( β = 0 . 444 ; t - value = 6 . 938 ) . Hypothesis 4 predicts a significant relationship between IC and EI and accepted at p < 0 . 05 . The result prove that H5 propose a significant association between IC and ATT ( β = 0 . 371 ; p < 0 . 001 ) and it is supported by the dataset . A similar level of support is found for H6 ( IC → ESE ) , describing a significant and positive relationship ( β = 0 . 142 ; t - value = 2 . 840 ) between IC and ESE . ESE is found to have strong effect on EI ( β = 0 . 434 ; p < 0 . 001 ) . Thus , H7 is supported . Finally , ATE has a more important role than ESE in enhancing the EI ( β = 0 . 471 > 0 . 444 ) .

Albers ( 2010 ) considers that the evaluation of the mediating influence should include both direct and indirect effects . To better illustrate the mediation effect , it is calculated using the bootstrapping method . It is possible to apply bootstrapping to small sample sizes because it does not infer the sampling distribution of statistical data or the distribution of variables ( Hair et al . , 2017 ) . Therefore , for the PLS - SEM method , a bootstrapping strategy to test the indirect effects is very suitable . Mediation expects to meet the following conditions : ( a ) Analyze the significance of the direct impact without considering the mediator variable . It can be seen from Figure 3 that creativity has a significant effect on EI ( β = − 0 . 072 , p < 0 . 05 ) ; There is a significant positive correlation between SS and EI ( β = 0 . 132 , p < 0 . 01 ) . ( b ) If the direct effect is significant , introduce the mediator variable in the PLS path model and assess indirect effect . ( H9a , H9b , H9c , H9d ) . The results show in Table 12 that creativity and ESE ( H6 ) , creativity and ATE ( H5 ) ; ESE and EI ( H7 ) , ATE and EI ( H8 ) ; SS and ESE ( H2 ) , SS and ATE ( H3 ) ; The relationship between them is significantly positive correlation . ( c ) If the indirect effect is significant , the mediator absorbs some of the direct effect ( Hair , 2014 ) . ( d ) The degree of absorption of mediator variables is evaluated by variance accounted for ( VAF ) , which is calculated through the following formula : VAF = Indirect effect / total effect * 100 , Total effect = indirect effect + direct effect . If VAF is less than 20 % , there is no mediation effect ; If the VAF is larger than 20 % and less than 80 % , that can be characterized as partial mediation ; full mediation exist if the VAF is above 80 % . There will be an exception to the VAF - based mediation effect assessment , namely the suppressor effect ( Hair , 2014 ) . For example , the VAF becomes larger than one or , in some instances , FIGURE 3 PLS results of the research model . Niu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1021969 Frontiers in Psychology 15 frontiersin . org even negative with suppressor effects and can no longer be interpreted . This kind of situation always represents full mediation . Therefore , the results in Table 13 show that ATE plays a complete mediating role in IC and EI because the value of VAF is negative ; the ESE also plays a complete mediating role in IC and EI because the value of VAF is greater than 1 ( Hair , 2014 ) . In addition , the ESE accounts for 70 . 7 % of the effect of SS on EI , indicating partial mediation ; the ATT can account for 62 . 3 % of the effect of SS on EI , which is called partial mediation . Moderation analysis Moderation is defined as a condition in which the relationship between two constructs is not constant but depends on the value of a third variable known as the moderator variable . The moderator variable affects the intensity or direction of the interaction between the two structures . Hair ( 2014 ) points out that the product indicator method cannot be used when either the exogenous latent variable or the moderator variable has a formative measurement model . Hence , this study use the two - stage approach by making explicit use of PLS - SEM’s advantage to estimate latent variable scores ( Henseler and Chin , 2010 ; Rigdon et al . , 2010 ) . Table 14 illustrates the results of the moderation analysis that indicate that RP moderates the IC - EI relationship . Furthermore , the moderation results for path coefficient , t - value , and value of p showed a significant relationship . In other words , when the moderator variable increases by one standard deviation , the slope of creativity ( the independent variable ) to entrepreneurial intention ( the dependent variable ) will increase by 2 . 239 standard deviation . Discussion The unprecedented high unemployment rate makes entrepreneurship an option for fresh graduates with the impact of the COVID - 19 and a sharp increase in employment pressure . Therefore , the purpose of this study is to understand the underlying mechanism behind the formation of entrepreneurial intentions based on the theory of planned behavior . Furthermore , this study hypothesizes that entrepreneurial intention is predicted by four variables : creativity ( IC ) , social support ( SS ) , entrepreneurial attitude ( ATE ) , and entrepreneurial self - efficacy ( ESE ) . Meanwhile , the moderating variable between creativity and entrepreneurial intention is risk propensity ( RP ) . The research model presented in Figure 4 is validated using PLS , and the results showed a good fit to the data . The hypothesized relationships among the constructs from the research model are supported . The findings , which are based on the TPB framework , are validated among students attending vocational colleges in China . The two proximal attitudinal dimensions of TPB significantly predict EIs among students and confirm the predictive power of the model , accounting for 83 . 9 % of the total variance in the student’s EI . The most important factor for predicting EIs for the current study is ESE , which is consistent with the previous studies by Laguía et al . ( 2019 ) , Li et al . ( 2020a ) , and Li et al . ( 2020b ) The research questions raised in the first paragraph of the introduction are discussed in the next few paragraphs . All predictors ( SS , ATE , ESE ) have a significant and direct relationship with entrepreneurial intention ( EI ) , while creativity has an indirect effect on EI through entrepreneurial self - efficacy and attitude . From Figure 4 , these indirect relationships can be shown : SS → ATE → EI ; SS → ESE → EI ; IC → ATE → EI ; and IC → ESE → EI . TABLE 13 The result of mediation analysis .

The empirical findings of this study are in line with Farooq ( 2018 ) . Farooq ( 2018 ) explored the role that SS and entrepreneurial skills play in individual EIs using the theory of planned behavior . The findings indicate that SS and entrepreneurial skills have a positive and significant impact on EI . From the perspective of social support , family and school are the main places for students to socialize . The support of “important groups” such as teachers , relatives , friends , and classmates will affect college students’ behavioral intentions . Entrepreneurship is a social activity . Choosing entrepreneurship is a major decision in college students’ career planning . Therefore , college students will seek advice and support from surrounding people , and the degree of support from important groups will affect individual EI . Therefore , it is very important to formulate policies to encourage students to start businesses so that they can get support and build confidence in the process of entrepreneurship . SS influences ESE directly and significantly ( H2 ) . The findings support the hypothesis proposed in earlier studies ( Khayru et al . , 2021 ; Bui Ngoc Tuan and Pham , 2022 ) . Bui Ngoc Tuan and Pham ( 2022 ) found that ESE is proportional to the amount of SS an individual receives from the surrounding environment . The more support an individual receives , the higher their level of self - efficacy will be . Governments at all levels have provided policy and material support for students’ entrepreneurship . At the same time , the innovation and entrepreneurship courses offered by vocational colleges have expanded students’ knowledge of entrepreneurship . This reduces the difficulty of students’ entrepreneurship to a certain extent , thereby improving the self - efficacy of students’ entrepreneurship . There is a direct relationship between the SS and ATE ( H3 ) . Consistent with the findings obtained in previous studies ( Anjum et al . , 2020a ; Valencia - Arias et al . , 2021 ) . Bui Ngoc Tuan and Pham ( 2022 ) reported that the assistance provided by the outside world to the entrepreneurs themselves can reduce the difficulties in starting a business and thus have a positive attitude toward entrepreneurship . All attitudes , including entrepreneurial attitudes , can change . It is possible to drive the positive emotions of students to participate in entrepreneurial activities and form a positive attitude through the support provided by the government and schools to college students’ entrepreneurial activities . Creativity has a statistically significant direct effect on ATE ( H5 ) . The result is in line with the outcomes of the study conducted by Anjum et al . ( 2020d ) . He empirically concluded that the association between creativity and attitude was significant using a sample of university students . This suggests that individuals with high creativity can produce more innovative ideas to solve problems in the process of entrepreneurship . They dare to meet unknown challenges and have a positive attitude toward entrepreneurship . As expected , the results of the present study point out that there is a direct and positive relationship between creativity and ESE ( H6 ) . Other studies have also empirically confirmed this relationship ( Shi et al . , 2019 ; Ahmed et al . , 2020 ) . A study conducted by Kumar and Shukla ( 2019 ) among management students finds that creativity is also considered to influence ESE significantly . Individuals with high creativity can break through the original thinking framework to think about problems , produce more innovative ideas , and have a higher level of confidence in their own ability to succeed as entrepreneurs . The present empirical study finds through data analysis that ESE is the most influential predictor of EI ( H7 ) . Some previous researchers also found the same findings ( Malebana and Swanepoel , 2014 ; Akter et al . , 2020 ) . Among other factors , Akter et al . ( 2020 ) identified that ESE actually plays the most important role in explaining EI . This could be due to the fact that self - efficacy is one of the most important personality traits , and it helps individuals become more capable of overcoming challenges and work in adverse situations . In addition , ESE itself represents their confidence in entrepreneurial success , so promoting self - efficacy is a powerful force to promote individual entrepreneurship . This study demonstrates the significant role of attitude in EI ( H8 ) ; that is , attitude is an important factor in determining whether an individual has intention . This result is consistent with Temoor Anjum et al . ( 2022 ) who found that ATE directly impacts EI as well as significantly mediates the relationship between entrepreneurial education and EI among business students . It demonstrates that the individual’s evaluation of the results of entrepreneurial activity has a direct correlation to the individual’s ATE , which in turn has a direct correlation to the individual’s EI . In line with the prior literature ( Biraglia and Kadile , 2017 ; Mahmood et al . , 2018 ; Ndofirepi , 2018 ) , the relationship between creativity and EI is completely mediated through ESE ( H9a ) and the variance explanation of creativity on EI is less than 20 % . Hence , creativity , as a factor in influencing entrepreneurship , is a low predictor . Also , the results from the study of Rodrigues et al . ( 2019 ) indicate that there is a weak relationship between creativity and EI in university students . This shows that creativity is not under an individual’s complete volitional control in many situations . Individuals with high creativity can guide entrepreneurs to set challenging goals , improve their ability to solve problems , and then enhance ESE . Vocational college students with creative characteristics not only show a higher sense of ESE but also are more sensitive and concerned about entrepreneurial information and entrepreneurial opportunities . Therefore , they may be more likely to have EI . The empirical results show that self - efficacy mediates the links with social support and intentions ( H9b ) , which consist of several studies ( Neneh , 2020 ; Westhuizen and Awotunde , 2021 ) . Neneh ( 2020 ) confirmed that the relationship between SS and entrepreneurial passion and EI is partially mediated by ESE using a sample of high school students . When individuals are provided with a greater quantity of positive feedback from their surroundings , it can assist them in reducing the psychological anxiety associated with being an entrepreneur and increasing their confidence in their ability to entrepreneurship . As a result , it will contribute to an improvement in one’s sense of self - efficacy . Niu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1021969 Frontiers in Psychology 17 frontiersin . org ATE plays a completely mediating role between creativity and EI ( H9c ) , which is in line with the previous studies ( Hu et al . , 2018 ; Rodrigues et al . , 2019 ) . Anjum et al . ( 2020d ) examined the mediating role of attitudes to enhance the creativity disposition toward EI and found that attitudes have a significant mediating role . The variance explanation of creativity on EI is less than 20 % in this study , so the direct effect of creativity on EI is weak . This means that when students’ creativity can increase their positive attitude toward entrepreneurship , their EI will increase . Students who are able to propose novel ideas and help solve problems are more inclined to start a business because they like flexible working hours and are willing to work hard for entrepreneurship . According to the results , SS is a key factor in enhancing EI . Nonetheless , this link is indirect , mediated by attitude ( H9d ) . These results corroborate and are in line with the previous research studies ( Murad et al . , 2021 ; Bui Ngoc Tuan and Pham , 2022 ) . Hence , not only should the government and schools offer extraneous support in the form of funds , policies , but they should also pay attention to strengthening positive incentives for students , guiding students to make positive attributions to failure , cultivating students’ optimism , and finally promoting the improvement of students’ EIs . RP positively moderates the relationship between IC and EI ( H10 ) . This result is consistent with Hussain et al . ( 2021 ) who believe that the relationship between creativity and EI is regulated by RP because risk is inevitable in the process of entrepreneurship . In the entrepreneurial literature , it is not uncommon to regard personal characteristics as factors that may affect the entrepreneurial process ( Phraudomsitthinayok , 2019 ; Liu et al . , 2021 ; Tariq et al . , 2021 ) . In most cases , however , only their primary effects as exogenous variables are taken into consideration when developing a causal model , and this study takes risk propensity as the moderating variable of creativity and EI . The moderating effect is mainly reflected in the following two aspects : On the one hand , individuals who have a high curiosity are willing to take risks and try new things , which contributes to the significance of the impact that creativity has on EI . On the other hand , people who have a high - risk propensity typically believe that “high risk , high return . ” have the courage to take on unknown challenges , and their creativity is improved in this process . Conclusion It is of great value to improve students’ EI to ease the employment pressure caused by the spread of the global epidemic . Thus , the current research is to examine the elements that influence vocational college students’ EI based on the theory of planned behavior . This study empirically tested the intention framework on a sample of 500 vocational college students . According to the findings of the data analysis , the 13 hypotheses of this study have been supported and verified to varying degrees . The results show that SS directly affects EI ; students’ CI and SS are positively related to ATE and ESE , which are subsequently related to students’ EI . However , CI is not directly related to EI , which needs to be completely mediated by ATE and ESE . This is an important finding which helps us to understand why creativity has a less direct effect on students’ EI . In addition , this research examines risk propensity as a psychological mechanism that plays a moderating role in the association between creativity and EI . Overall , the proposed model fit well and explained 83 . 9 % of the variance , which demonstrates that the proposed model can predict and explain the factors that affect students’ EI to a certain extent . Implications Practical implications The results of this study show that creativity is crucial to improving the EI of vocational college students . At the same time , it also has some enlightenment for educational institutions and government departments . Firstly , it is generally agreed that universities are the best places to learn new knowledge , ideas , and innovation . The findings of the current study provide support for the indirect effect of creativity on entrepreneurship ( Fu et al . , 2022 ; Niu and Wu , 2022 ) . The results reinforce the idea that creativity alone will not help in stimulating favorable intentions to start a business . Hence , vocational colleges should change teaching methods and improve students’ understanding and positive attitude toward entrepreneurship . On the other hand , it is also important that vocational colleges help students develop a sense of adventure , reduce the gap between what they perceive as their own subjective risks and the actual risks they face , and enhance their ability to deal with risk in the process of entrepreneurship . Secondly , entrepreneurs should be provided with a more conducive atmosphere for entrepreneurship by various government departments . On the one hand , with regard to vocational college students , governments need to make the policies more widely known in a timely manner and try to improve the awareness of preferential policies . In addition , the government needs to simplify the application and approval procedures for entrepreneurs . On the other hand , the governments holds various entrepreneurship competitions to build a good stage for college students’ entrepreneurs and create an open entrepreneurial atmosphere to improve students’ intentions to start a business , so as to enhance the possibility of students’ entrepreneurship . In addition to this , they should put forth greater efforts to support business incubators and reevaluate the microfinance programs that are already open to graduates upon completion of their degrees . Niu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1021969 Frontiers in Psychology 18 frontiersin . org Theoretical implications In addition , the findings of this study illustrate the meaningful theoretical contributions . First , further expand the scope of creativity research ( Wu and Wang , 2018 ) . In the past , the research related to creativity was mostly focused on enterprises , and the research objects were mostly enterprise employees , leaders ( Wu and Tian , 2021 ) . This study applies the theory of creativity to the field of vocational education and expands the scope of creativity research by taking students in vocational colleges as the research object . Second , expand the influencing factors of entrepreneurial intention . Although previous studies have also focused on the impact of individual factors on entrepreneurial intention , creativity is still easy to ignore . This study introduces the individual factors of creativity and risk propensity , as well as takes into account environmental factors , such as social support , which enriches the existing literature on incorporating personal ability and environmental factors into intention models . Third , from the perspective of the interaction between individuals and the environment , this paper discusses the potential reasons for the formation of entrepreneurial intention , and clarifies the correlation between multiple variables . Finally , in terms of methodology , this study employs hierarchical modeling using PLS in order to explain the relationships in its model . Limitations and directions for future research Like other studies , this study has certain limitations but provides a certain direction for future research . Firstly , the samples for this study are mainly concentrated in Southeast and East China due to time and energy constraints . Future research can further expand the scope of research and increase the number of samples to improve the validity of research conclusions . Secondly , the gender ratio of the sample in this study is uneven , and the number of females is quite small . Future researchers should pay attention to the sampling balance . Thirdly , this study failed to take into account the discrepancies between an ideal and an actual situation . The true scenario regarding the number of students who actually choose a profession in entrepreneurship after completing their education is unknown . The ways in which our focal individual characteristic ( creativity ) affects the transition of intentions into actions need additional research ( Zampetakis et al . , 2011 ) . Finally , in the relationship between creativity and entrepreneurial intention , risk propensity may not only be a moderating variable but also the common influence of other variables , which can also be explored in the future .
