H . ) ; and School of Biology , University of Newcastle , Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 7RU , United Kingdom ( T . T . ) A salinity and dehydration stress - responsive calcium - dependent protein kinase ( CDPK ) was isolated from the common ice plant ( Mesembryanthemum crystallinum ; McCPK1 ) . McCPK1 undergoes myristoylation , but not palmitoylation in vitro . Removal of the N - terminal myristate acceptor site partially reduced McCPK1 plasma membrane ( PM ) localization as determined by transient expression of green ﬂuorescent protein fusions in microprojectile - bombarded cells . Removal of the N - terminal domain ( amino acids 1 – 70 ) completely abolished PM localization , suggesting that myristoylation and possibly the N - terminal domain contribute to membrane association of the kinase . The recombinant , Escherichia coli - expressed , full - length McCPK1 protein was catalytically active in a calcium - dependent manner ( K 0 . 5 5 0 . 15 m M ) . Autophosphorylation of recombinant McCPK1 was observed in vitro on at least two different Ser residues , with the location of two sites being mapped to Ser - 62 and Ser - 420 . An Ala substitution at the Ser - 62 or Ser - 420 autophosphorylation site resulted in a slight increase in kinase activity relative to wild - type McCPK1 against a histone H1 substrate . In contrast , Ala substitutions at both sites resulted in a dramatic decrease in kinase activity relative to wild - type McCPK1 using histone H1 as substrate . McCPK1 undergoes a reversible change in subcellular localization from the PM to the nucleus , endoplasmic reticulum , and actin microﬁlaments of the cytoskeleton in response to reductions in humidity , as determined by transient expression of McCPK1 - green ﬂuorescent protein fusions in microprojectile - bombarded cells and conﬁrmed by subcellular fractionation and western - blot analysis of 6 3 His - tagged McCPK1 . Calcium is a ubiquitous and pivotal second messenger in the signal transduction networks that plants use to respond to a wide variety of physio - logical stimuli . Cytosolic Ca 2 1 ﬂuctuations have been observed in response to a number of stimuli , including red light , abscisic acid ( ABA ) , GA , drought , hyper - and hypo - osmotic stress , ionic stress , touch , cold , heat shock , oxidative stress , fungal elicitors , and nodula - tion factors ( Sanders et al . , 2002 ) . Ca 2 1 - dependent or calmodulin - like domain protein kinases ( CDPKs ) , which are found only in plants , green algae , and certain protists , are an important group of sensor - responder proteins that function through intramolec - ular interactions to decode Ca 2 1 signals . In Arabidop - sis , CDPKs form one of the largest Ca 2 1 - binding protein families , with 34 unique CDPK genes plus numerous CDPK - related kinases ( Harmon et al . , 2000 , 2001 ; Hrabak , 2000 ; Hrabak et al . , 2003 ) . CDPKs are composed of a single polypeptide chain with a catalytic kinase domain at the N terminus , an intervening junction domain , and a calmodulin - like domain at the C terminus containing up to four functional Ca 2 1 - binding EF hands . The junction do - main acts as an autoinhibitor in a pseudosubstrate fashion ( Harper et al . , 1994 ; Vitart et al . , 2000 ; Weljie et al . , 2000 ) . Binding of Ca 2 1 to the calmodulin - like domain results in a conformational change leading to the release of the autoinhibitor domain from the active site and kinase activation ( Harmon et al . , 1994 ; Harper et al . , 1994 ) . Many CDPKs also have additional N - terminal leader and C - terminal domains composed of highly variable amino acid sequences . AtCPK25 and some CDPK - related kinases possess degenerate cal - modulin domains ( Lindzen and Choi , 1995 ; Zhang and Lu , 2003 ) and apparently do not require Ca 2 1 activation ( Furumoto et al . , 1996 ) . CDPKs exhibit diverse subcellular localization pat - terns , suggesting that they participate in a wide variety of signaling pathways . CDPKs have been 1 This work was supported in part by the U .

A majority of CDPKs from Arabidopsis contain the proper consensus sequence context for N - myristoyla - tion at the second position Gly residue ( M G NXX - [ ACGSTV ] [ ^ DE ] or M G [ ^ DEFKRVWY ] XX [ ACGSTV ] [ KR ] ; Boisson et al . , 2003 ) . To date , three CDPKs have been shown to be myristoylated at the N - terminal Gly residue : CpCDPK1 from zucchini ( Cucurbita pepo ; Ellard - Ivey et al . , 1999 ) , AtCPK2 from Arabidopsis ( Lu and Hrabak , 2002 ) , and LeCPK1 from tomato ( Ly - copersicon esculentum ; Rutschmann et al . , 2002 ) . Such myristoylation events are critical for localization to the ER ( Lu and Hrabak , 2002 ) or the PM ( Rutschmann et al . , 2002 ) . Membrane localization correlates well with the presence of N - terminal myristoylation con - sensus motifs , suggesting that myristoylation is an important factor in membrane association ( Yoon et al . , 1999 ; Martı´n and Busconi , 2000 ; Dammann et al . , 2003 ) . CDPKs containing a myristoylation con - sensus motif also contain at least one potential palmitoylation site at several Cys residues ( Cheng et al . , 2002 ; Hrabak et al . , 2003 ) . Myristoylation of both the N - terminal Gly and palmitoylation at the C4 and C5 positions of OsCPK2 has been dem - onstrated to occur in vivo in maize ( Zea mays ) leaf protoplasts with both acyl modiﬁcations contributing to full membrane association ( Martı´n and Busconi , 2000 ) . Recent studies have begun to clarify the speciﬁc roles of individual CDPKs in signal transduction cascades . Direct evidence for CDPK participation in biotic , abiotic , and ABA signaling pathways has been reported in only a few instances ( Sheen , 1996 ; Saijo et al . , 2000 , 2001 ; Romeis et al . , 2001 ) . For example , Sheen ( 1996 ) showed that two out of eight Arabidopsis CDPK isoforms could activate expression from a cold , high - salt , dark , and ABA - regulated promoter ( HVA - 1 ) in a maize leaf protoplast transient expression system . More recently , Saijo et al . ( 2000 , 2001 ) demonstrated that overexpression of a single CDPK conferred im - proved cold , salt , and drought tolerance in rice ( Oryza sativa ) . Pharmacological studies have implicated CDPK participation in fungal pathogen defense ( Romeis et al . , 2000 ) , wound signaling ( Schaller and Oecking , 1999 ) , and osmotic stress signaling ( Pestena ´ cz and Erdei , 1996 ; Taybi and Cushman , 1999 ) . Furthermore , the expression patterns or activity changes of some CDPKs have suggested functional roles in low - temperature , ionic , osmotic , or water deﬁcit stress signaling ( Urao et al . , 1994 ; Botella et al . , 1996 ; Pestena´cz and Erdei , 1996 ; Yoon et al . , 1999 ; Komatsu et al . , 2001 ; Chico et al . , 2002 ; Llop - Tous et al . , 2002 ) , light responses ( Pagnussat et al . 2002 ) , jasmo - nate signaling ( Ulloa et al . , 2002 ) , and elicitor - induced signaling ( Yoon et al . , 1999 ; Murillo et al . , 2001 ; Romeis et al . , 2001 ) . The wide variety of potential CDPK substrates described to date suggests diverse functional roles for this class of protein kinases ( Harmon et al . , 2000 ; Hrabak , 2000 ; Cheng et al . , 2002 ) . One approach to elucidate the functional roles of speciﬁc CDPKs is reverse genetics . To this end , Arabidopsis plants harboring T - DNA insertions in many different CDPK isogenes have now been isolated ( Cheng et al . , 2002 ) . However , this approach may be ham - pered by functional redundancy of related CDPKs . Another approach to understanding CDPK function is to deﬁne the speciﬁc substrates or other proteins with which particular kinases interact . Although many potential CDPK substrates have been identi - ﬁed ( e . g . soluble enzymes , ion and water channels , pumps , and transcription factors ) , there are few reports of identiﬁed substrates for speciﬁc CDPKs ( Harmon et al . , 2000 ; Hrabak , 2000 ; Cheng et al . , 2002 ) . A guard cell CDPK has been characterized that can phosphorylate the KAT1 potassium channel and thus is likely to participate in Ca 2 1 regulation of stomatal responses to environmental stimuli ( Li et al . , 1998 ) . Phosphorylation of AtACA2 , a calmodulin - stimulated Ca 2 1 pump , by CPK1 inhibits Ca 2 1 pumping , leading to alterations in Ca 2 1 signatures arising from ER stores ( Hwang et al . , 2000 ) . Using a maize protoplast transient expression system , AtCPK1 can phosphorylate in vivo recombinant Phe ammonia lyase , a key enzyme in pathogen defense , stress response , and secondary metabolism ( Cheng et al . , 2001 ) . The yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevi - siae ) two - hybrid system has also been used to di - rectly identify CDPK substrates . Patharkar and Cushman ( 2000 ) identiﬁed a pseudoresponse regu - lator ( McCSP1 ) as a substrate of a salt and drought stress - inducible CDPK from ice plant ( Mesembryan - themum crystallinum ; McCPK1 ) . More recently , a reg - ulatory subunit of 26S proteasome ( NtRpn3 ) was found to be a substrate for a tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum ) CDPK ( NtCPK1 ; Lee et al . , 2003 ) . In this article , we show that the mRNA abundance of McCPK1 is transiently up - regulated by ionic and osmotic stress , implicating its involvement in abiotic stress signaling pathways . Biochemical analysis of McCPK1 demonstrates that this kinase is activated by Ca 2 1 and undergoes autophosphorylation on at least two different Ser residues , with the location of two such sites being mapped to Ser - 62 and Ser - 420 . We used ﬂuorescence imaging of McCPK1 - synthetic green ﬂuorescent protein ( sGFP ) fusions to demonstrate that McCPK1 localizes to the PM , nucleus , and cytoskele - ton structures in living cells . Subcellular fractionation studies corroborated these observations . We also dem - onstrate that McCPK1 undergoes cotranslational N - myristoylation , which appears to be necessary for subcellular localization to the PM . Moreover , we show Stress - Induced CDPK Subcellular Localization Dynamics Plant Physiol .

Under constant conditions , this subcellular localiza - tion is reset to the PM . These results demonstrate that McCPK1 undergoes dynamic changes in subcellular localization following abiotic stress . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Isolation and Sequence Analysis of McCpk1 A l Uni - ZapXR cDNA expression library was prepared from leaf tissue of ice plants exposed to 0 . 5 M NaCl stress for 30 h , as described previously ( Forsthoefel et al . , 1995 ) , and probed with a partial cDNA product isolated by degenerate primer reverse transcription ( RT ) - PCR . Sequence analysis of the longest cDNA clone recovered by library screening revealed that it did not encode a full - length cDNA . Therefore , 5 # RACE was used to recover the full - length transcript . The full - length McCpk1 cDNA ( 2 , 364 bp ) contained a single open reading frame ( ORF ) of 1 , 605 bp ﬂanked by 5 # and 3 # untranslated sequences of 336 and 423 bp , respectively , including a poly ( A 1 ) tail of 48 adenine residues ( accession no . AF090835 ) . The ORF predicted a polypeptide of 534 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 60 kD . Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the protein contains the domain struc - ture typical of CDPKs , including an N - variable do - main ( amino acids 1 – 84 ) , a protein kinase domain ( amino acids 85 – 346 ) , a junction or autoinhibitory ( pseudosubstrate ) domain ( amino acids 347 – 379 ) , and four EF hands within the calmodulin - like domain ( amino acids 386 – 534 ) . Alignment and phylogenetic analysis using the entire length of the deduced McCPK1 protein sequence showed it fell within the branch 2 cluster of plant and algal CDPKs ( see Fig . 2 ; Harmon et al . , 2000 ) and , from among Arabidopsis CDPKs is most closely related to AtCPK9 ( accession no . AAB03242 ; Hrabak et al . , 2003 ) . McCpk1 Is Transiently Induced by Salinity and Water Deﬁcit Stress Semiquantitative RT - PCR analysis of McCpk1 mRNA abundance in detached leaves subjected to dehydration and salinity stress treatments showed that McCpk1 steady - state transcripts increased in abun - dance after 1 to 2 . 5 h following high - salinity ( 0 . 4 M NaCl ) and dehydration stress , respectively ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . Dehydration stress caused a more rapid in - duction of McCpk1 transcripts than salinity stress . Detached leaves of ice plant have been used success - fully to monitor gene expression or enzyme activities related to Crassulacean acid metabolism induction by osmotic and ionic stress , suggesting that they can sense and respond to such stimuli in the absence of root signals ( Taybi and Cushman , 1999 ) . Comparison of McCpk1 expression in different ice plant organs revealed that steady - state McCpk1 transcripts were approximately 3 - fold more abundant in leaves than in roots from well - watered or soil - grown plants subjec - ted to salinity stress ( 500 m M NaCl ) for 5 d ( Fig . 1C ) . As a control , the transcript abundance of a gene coding for ferredoxin NADP 1 reductase ( Fnr1 ) was moni - tored using the same RNA samples and remained unchanged following stress consistent with earlier observations that Fnr1 expression was unaffected by dehydration and ionic stress ( Michalowski et al . , 1989 ; Taybi and Cushman , 1999 ) . It should be noted that McCpk1 transcripts were more than 130 - fold less abundant than Fnr1 transcripts . Figure 1 .

These results suggest that McCPK1 may be involved in decoding stress - induced Ca 2 1 signatures and link - ing them to adaptive responses . Stress - responsive mRNA expression correlates well with a role in stress - adaptive responses in several cases . For exam - ple , transcripts for the AtCPK10 and AtCPK11 genes increased in abundance following water deﬁcit and salinity stress ( Urao et al . , 1994 ) . Expression of a constitutively active form of AtCPK10 in maize pro - toplasts activated expression from the stress - inducible HVA1 promoter ( Sheen 1996 ) . The salt - , water deﬁcit - , and cold - induced OsCPK7 gene from rice , when over - expressed in transgenic rice , conferred improved cold , salt , and drought tolerance ( Saijo et al . , 2000 ) . Many other examples of multiple stimuli inducing the ex - pression of individual CPKs are known . Increased steady - state transcripts , abundance , or activities of various CPKs in response to low - temperature , ionic , osmotic , water deﬁcit , wounding , and elicitor treat - ments implicate their possible involvement in signal - ing response networks for these environmental stimuli ( Botella et al . , 1996 ; Pestena´cz and Erdei , 1996 ; Yoon et al . , 1999 ; Komatsu et al . , 2001 ; Murillo et al . , 2001 ; Romeis et al . , 2001 ; Chico et al . , 2002 ; Llop - Tous et al . , 2002 ) . The remaining challenge is to determine the speciﬁc contribution to signaling pathways made by each individual CDPK and the degree of overlap or redundancy among these different signaling cascades . Biochemical Characterization of McCPK1 To assess the biochemical activity of McCPK1 , the full - length cDNA of McCpk1 was expressed as a C - terminal 6 3 His - tag fusion protein and puriﬁed from Escherichia coli to near homogeneity using His - Bind resin tag afﬁnity chromatography ( Fig . 2A ) . The substrate speciﬁcity of the recombinant , puriﬁed kinase was determined using a variety of exogenous substrates known to be phosphorylated by CDPKs . Histone H1 was phosphorylated ( K m 5 5 . 5 m M ) by McCPK1 ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) and served as a better substrate than all synthetic peptide ( e . g . syntide - 2 , autocamtide , autocamtide - 2 , and kemptide ) sub - strates tested ( data not shown ) . Therefore , histone H1 was used to determine how Ca 2 1 binding affects McCPK1 activity . Recombinant McCPK1 kinase activ - ity was tested over a range of Ca 2 1 concentrations in the presence of histone H1 as a substrate ( Fig . 2D ) . The Ca 2 1 stimulated McCPK1 activity by more than 6 - fold . The [ Ca 2 1 ] for half - maximal activity ( K 0 . 5 ) was Figure 2 .

The uninduced ( uninduced ) lane provides a control for nonspeciﬁcally expressed E . coli proteins . The isopropyl thio - b - D - galactoside - induced ( induced ) crude extracts were puriﬁed by afﬁnity chromatography on a His - Bind resin . The bound fusion protein , indicated with an asterisk following elution of the McCPK1 - 6 3 His fusion ( puriﬁed McCPK1 ) , was puriﬁed from the column ( ﬂow through ) . The uninduced , induced , and ﬂow - through lanes contained 1 . 2 m g of protein , whereas the puriﬁed McCPK1 lane contained 0 . 8 m g of protein .

This value was lower than previously reported values for soybean ( Glycine max ) CDPK - b ( K 0 . 5 5 0 . 4 m M ) and CDPK - g ( K 0 . 5 5 1 . 0 m M ) , with only CDPK - a ( K 0 . 5 5 0 . 06 m M ) , measured in the presence of the peptide substrate syntide - 2 , having a lower value ( Lee et al . , 1998 ) . This value was also higher than that obtained for sandalwood ( Santalum album ) CDPK ( 0 . 7 m M ) with histone III - S as a substrate ( Anil and Rao , 2001 ) ; however , it was lower than the K 0 . 5 for histone III - S phosphorylation ( about 4 m M ) by soybean CDPK - a or for casein phosphorylation by Plasmodium falciparum CDPK1 ( Zhao et al . , 1994 ) . Various signals modulate intracellular Ca 2 1 levels ( Rudd and Franklin - Tong , 2001 ; Sanders et al . , 2002 ) . However , Ca 2 1 does not move freely within the cell ( Trewavas , 1999 ) . To transduce these signals intracellu - larly into downstream effects , CDPKs are thought to be the primary sensors of these Ca 2 1 signatures . The resting concentration for cytosolic Ca 2 1 is estimated to be approximately 100 n M ( Rudd and Franklin - Tong , 2001 ) . Since McCPK1 has a Ca 2 1 half - maximal activity value at 150 n M , which is only 50 n M above the resting concentration , this suggests that McCPK1 may sense relatively small changes in cytosolic Ca 2 1 concentra - tionsandlinkthesechangestoappropriatedownstreamadaptiveresponses . Vitart et al . ( 2000 ) proposed two models for the activation of CPKs by Ca 2 1 . In both models , Ca 2 1 binding to the calmodulin - like domain is proposed to result in conformational changes that lead tokinaseactivation . However , itisdifﬁculttopredictthe Ca 2 1 - binding properties of a calmodulin - like domain from its amino acid sequence alone . Some CDPKs appear to have defective EF hands that alter their Ca 2 1 - binding properties . For example , Zhao et al . ( 1994 ) showed that only the ﬁrst EF hand of PfCPK1 needed to be functional in order to undergo Ca 2 1 activation . Rutschmann et al . ( 2002 ) classiﬁed two EF hands of LeCPK1 as high Ca 2 1 - binding sites and the other two as low Ca 2 1 - binding sites , with the ﬁrst group of EF hands believed to be responsible for the Ca 2 1 activation of LeCPK1 . Based on these observations , Ca 2 1 is thought to bind more readily to the EF hands proximal to the kinase domain . To verify this hypoth - esis , site - directed mutagenesis of the calmodulin - like domainofMcCPK1couldbeusedtomutagenizeeachofthefourEFhandsaloneandinvariouscombinations , and then to test the activity of the mutant forms in response to Ca 2 1 . Mapping the Autophosphorylation Sites of McCPK1 In addition to Ca 2 1 , intramolecular autophosphor - ylation on Ser / Thr residues may play a role in inﬂuencing the activity of CDPK . As a ﬁrst step toward understanding how autophosphorylation events may affect CDPK activity , we mapped two autophosphor - ylation sites on McCPK1 . Recombinant McCPK1 was subjected to in vitro autophosphorylation without prior phosphatase treatment , after which the auto - phosphorylation sites were mapped by quadrupole - time - of - ﬂight mass spectrometry . We identiﬁed Ser - 62 and Ser - 420 as two of the targets for autophosphor - ylation in McCPK1 ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . The Ser - 62 site mapped to the N - variable domain , similar to the Ser - 18 autophosphorylation site mapped recently in NtCPK2 ( Glinski et al . , 2003 ) . The Ser - 420 is located within the calmodulin - like domain between the ﬁrst and second EF hands nearest the kinase domain . This location is analogous to the autophosphorylation site Ser - 439 mapped in LeCPK1 from tomato ( Rutschmann et al . , 2002 ) . The amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphophorylation sites of McCPK1 were com - pared with those of NtCPK2 and LeCPK1 ( Fig . 3C ) . These sites of phosphorylation conform largely to a consensus autophosphorylation motif ( X - 6 - X - 5 - u - 4 - Basic - 3 - u - 2 - X - 1 - pS - X 1 1 - X 1 2 - X 1 3 - X 1 4 - X 1 5 ) , where u indi - cates hydrophobic residues and pS indicates the phos - phorylated Ser residue . This consensus sequence most closely resembles the maximal phosphorylation con - sensus described by Huang and Huber ( 2001 ) except for the hydrophobic residues present at positions 2 2 and 2 4 , the lack of consensus hydrophobic residues at position 2 5 and 1 4 , and the lack of consensus basic residues at positions 2 6 and 1 5 . Activity of McCPK1 Autophosphorylation Mutants Recombinant and native CDPKs exhibit intramolec - ular autophosphorylation . However , the role of auto - phosphorylation in regulating CDPK activity remains unclear . Autophosphorylation of a CDPK puriﬁed from winged bean was shown to inhibit its activity ( Saha and Singh , 1995 ) . On the other hand , autophos - phorylation of groundnut CDPK was suggested to be a prerequisite for its activity , but autophosphorylation occurs at low Ca 2 1 concentrations and might not have a regulatory role in vivo ( Chaudhuri et al . , 1999 ) . Preautophosphorylation of sandalwood CDPK neither inhibited nor stimulated the kinase’s activity , suggest - ing that autophosphorylation is inconsequential to its substrate activity ( Anil and Rao , 2001 ) . Activation in vitro of CPK2 from tobacco was accompanied by autophosphorylation , which was not inhibited by W - 7 , a calmodulin and CDPK antagonist , suggesting that direct phosphorylation by an upstream protein kinase and not autophosphorylation was responsible for activation ( Romeis et al . , 2000 , 2001 ) . Therefore , clear evidence for the dependence of activity on the autophosphorylation has not emerged to date . With the identiﬁcation of two residues that undergo autophosphorylation in McCPK1 , we examined how autokinase and substrate kinase activities may be changed by mutating these autophosphorylation sites to Ala . Both the single mutants ( S62A McCPK1 and S420A McCPK1 ) and the double mutant ( S62A / S420A McCPK1 ) were examined . Autophosphorylation was analyzed by in vitro kinase reactions using afﬁnity - puriﬁed , recombinant McCPK1 ( Table I ) . All mutant forms retained calcium - dependent activity . Chehab et al . 1434 Plant Physiol . Vol . 135 , 2004 www . plantphysiol . org on July 22 , 2017 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 2004 American Society of Plant Biologists . All rights reserved . However , quantitative analysis of autokinase activities revealed that , without substrate , although there were differences among genotypes in their ability to auto - phosphorylate both with ( P 5 0 . 0164 ) and without ( P 5 0 . 0349 ) calcium , such differences were only slightly signiﬁcant . The double - mutant form of the kinase containing both S62A and S420A substitutions was still able to exhibit autophosphorylation ( data not shown ) . However , attempts to map these alternative sites have proved unsuccessful thus far . Autophosphorylation site amino acid substitutions may result in minute conformational changes in kinase structure , leading to the observed changes in activity . Currently , such conformational changes would be difﬁcult to predict , since the crystal structure of CDPKs is still unknown . However , one of the models proposed by Vitart et al . ( 2000 ) for the activation of CDPKs suggests that the inactive and active states of the kinase are closely related conformationally . Once Ca 2 1 binds to the EF hands and / or autophosphoryla - tion takes place , subtle changes in the conformation of the kinase are thought to cause the removal of the pseudosubstrate and the activation of the enzyme . Nevertheless , such predicted conformational changes cannot be conﬁrmed until the structure of wild - type CDPK and its mutant forms is resolved . It will also be interesting and informative to map the alternative autophosphorylation sites in these mutants . The phos - phorylation of alternative sites also suggests that a particular autophosphorylation site may not be entirely essential for autophosphorylation activity per se . Next , we examined the effect of mutating the autophosphorylation sites on the ability of the en - zymes to phosphorylate histone H1 ( Table II ) . There was a notable interaction between the inﬂuence of enzyme preparation and kinase genotype on kinase activity that was more pronounced in the presence of Ca 2 1 ( P 5 0 . 0004 ) than in its absence ( P 5 0 . 03 ) . Lack of autophosphorylation at Ser - 62 or Ser - 420 increased activity of the kinase slightly relative to wild - type McCPK1 . In contrast , the double substitution S62A / Figure 3 .

S420A McCPK1 dramatically decreased the activity relative to the wild - type kinase . This suggests that simultaneous autophosphorylation of both Ser - 62 and Ser - 420 may be important for the activity of the enzyme . Ser - 62 is located in the N - terminal variable domain . Ser - 420 is located in the calmodulin - like domain between EF hand 1 and EF hand 2 . Lack of autophosphorylation at these sites may limit the ability of the mutant kinase to undergo subtle confor - mational changes or impair the efﬁciency of Ca 2 1 binding required for the removal of the pseudosub - strate and activation of the enzyme relative to the wild - type kinase . Alternatively , the introduced double S62A / S420A substitution may have resulted in struc - tural alterations in the kinase itself that could account for the reduced activity of the kinase . It is highly unlikely that the autophosphorylation and kinase activities obtained here were inﬂuenced by a contaminating kinase copurifying with the recombi - nant , puriﬁed forms of McCPK1 used in these experi - ments for several reasons . The relative purity of the different forms of the recombinant kinases was esti - mated using NIH image software to be very high ( S62A McCPK1 - 6 3 His 95 % , S420A McCPK1 - 6 3 His 96 % , S62A S420A McCPK1 - 6 3 His 96 % , and the wild - type McCPK1 - 6 3 His 95 % ) . The relative abundance of any contaminating kinase activity copurifying with the McCPK1 - 6 3 His tagged after nickel resin afﬁnity chromatography would be expected to be very low . Second , all of the activities measured were Ca 2 1 de - pendent . An inspection of all of the kinases encoded on the E . coli genome at the Bioinformatics Center Institute for Chemical Research , Kyoto University Web site ( www . genome . ad . jp ) revealed that the E . coli genome does not encode predicted Ca 2 1 - or calmodulin - dependent protein kinases .

All rights reserved . determined to undergo this cotranslational modiﬁca - tion ( Fig . 4A ) . We conﬁrmed that McCPK1 undergoes N - terminal myristoylation in vitro by transcribing and translating the full - length cDNA containing a C - terminal 6 3 His - tag fusion using a coupled tran - scription - translation system from wheat germ extract , which contains N - myristoyltransferase activity ( Heuckeroth et al . , 1988 ; Ellard - Ivey et al . , 1999 ) , in the presence of [ 35 S ] Met for detecting protein synthesis or [ 3 H ] Myristic acid for detecting myristoylation ( Fig . 4B ) . A 25 - kD vaccinia viral protein ( L1R ) known to be myristoylated ( Franke et al . , 1990 ) was used as a pos - itive control ( Fig . 4B ) . The identity of the labeled products from the McCPK1 programmed reactions was conﬁrmed by immunoprecipitation with anti - 6 3 His - tag monoclonal antibodies . A protein of the expected size of the McCPK1 - 6 3 His - tag fusion pro - tein ( approximately 60 kD ) was recovered from both the [ 35 S ] Met and [ 3 H ] Myristic acid - labeling reactions ( Fig . 4C ) . To detect activity for N - myristoyltransferase , Gly is absolutely required at position 2 relative to the N - terminal Met ( Yalovsky et al . , 1999 ) . Furthermore , N - myristoylation in Arabidopsis requires the con - sensus sequence ( M G NXX [ ACGSTV ] [ ^ DE ] or M G [ ^ DEFKRVWY ] XX [ ACGSTV ] [ KR ] ; Boisson et al . , 2003 ) . All of the CDPK shown to undergo N - terminal myristoylation conform to one of these two consensus sequences ( Fig . 4A ) . The N - variable domain of most CDPKs plays an important role in the subcellular localization to the PM via N - terminal myristoylation or in the interaction with other proteins or substrates and may thereby confer speciﬁcity to discrete Ca 2 1 - dependent signaling pathways . For example , Dammann et al . ( 2003 ) showed that two CDPKs from Arabidopsis ( AtCPK3 and AtCPK4 ) without putative acylation sites localize to the soluble fraction of the cell extracts , whereas seven other CDPKs ( AtCPK1 , AtCPK7 , AtCPK8 , AtCPK9 , AtCPK16 , AtCPK21 , and AtCPK28 ) harboring potential acylation sites ( myris - toylation and palmitoylation ) were membrane associ - ated . CDPKs containing a myristoylation consensus motif also contain at least one potential palmitoylation site at several Cys residues ( i . e . C4 or C5 in Fig . 4A ; Cheng et al . , 2002 ; Hrabak et al . , 2003 ) . Since McCPK1 has a Cys residue at position C4 , we tested whether or not McCPK1 could undergo palmitoylation in the pre - sence of [ 3 H ] Palmitic acid using the wheat germ tran - scription - translation system ; however , we could detect no evidence of labeling ( data not shown ) . Protein palmitoylation is achieved through esteriﬁcation of Cys thiol groups by palmitate ( Yalovsky et al . , 1999 ) . The primary sequence motif predictive of palmitoyla - tion has not been identiﬁed ; however , palmitoylation is often found associated with myristate or near - hydrophobic sequences . To our knowledge , N - palmi - toyltransferase activity has not been reported in wheat germ extracts ; therefore , it remains uncertain if McCPK1 failed to become palmitoylated because the Figure 4 . McCPK1 undergoes myristoylation in vitro and PM localiza - tion of McCPK1 - sGFP fusion depends upon myristoylation of McCPK1 .

All rights reserved . activity is absent from the extracts or because McCPK1 is normally not palmitoylated in vivo . Future experi - ments using a protoplast system known to contain N - palmitoyltransferase activity , such as that employed by Martı´n and Busconi ( 2000 ) , are needed . Since myristoylation by itself normally is not suf - ﬁcient for membrane localization ( Shahinian and Silvius , 1995 ) , we further investigated the membrane localization requirements for McCPK1 by fusing the wild - type kinase to sGFP ( Sheen et al . , 1995 ; Chiu et al . , 1996 ) under the control of the cauliﬂower mosaic virus 35S promoter . Fusions were introduced into the cells of plants exposed to 80 % relative humidity ( unstressed conditions ) via microprojectile bombardment and ex - amined using ﬂuorescence microscopy . The fusion localized preferentially to the PM ( Fig . 4D ) . We then mutated the N - terminal Gly residue and replaced it with an unmyristoylatable Ala residue . Substitution of the N - terminal Gly residue results in the abolishment of both myristoylation and palmitoylation , suggesting that myristoylation may be a prerequisite for palmi - tolyation ( Martı´n and Busconi , 2000 ) . The G2A - McCPK1 - sGFP fusion protein displayed a marked reduction in localization to the PM ( Fig . 4E ) . This observation was consistent with the major role N - terminal myristoylation ( and possibly palmitoyla - tion ) is known to play in the localization of CPKs to the PM . However , some PM localization was retained by the G2A - McCPK1 - sGFP fusion protein , suggesting that myristoylation alone ( and possibly palmitoyla - tion ) cannot account fully for the observed membrane localization . An additional feature for stable mem - brane anchoring for many fatty acylated proteins is the presence of a polybasic domain with a cluster of positively charged amino acids ( Resh , 1999 ) . The basic amino acids form electrostatic interactions with the head groups of acidic , negatively charged phospholi - pids of the membrane bilayer ( Murray et al . , 1997 ) . The N - terminal domain ( amino acids 1 – 70 ) of McCPK1 contains 8 basic amino acids ( 11 . 4 % ) , which may aid in membrane binding . To test this possibility , we removed the ﬁrst 70 amino acids of McCPK1 - sGFP fusion protein and found that the remaining PM localization was lost ( Fig . 4F ) , such that the N - terminal D 1 to 70 deletion mutant of the McCPK1 - sGFP fusion protein assumed a subcellular distribution pattern similar to the sGFP alone , which exhibited no PM localization ( Fig . 4G ) . Since McCPK1 does not undergo palmitoylation in vitro , this suggests that stable an - choring of McCPK1 to the PM may require a second feature at the N terminus , such as N - terminal poly - basic domains with clusters of positively charged amino acids to anchor it to the PM . The N - terminal domain ( amino acids 1 – 70 ) of McCPK1 contains 8 positively charged basic residues . Such amino acids may interact with the head groups of acidic phospho - lipids that impart a negative charge to the cytoplasmic surface of the PM . Similarly , Rutschmann et al . ( 2002 ) observed a partial loss in the localization of LeCPK1 to the PM in suspension - cultured tomato cells transiently expressing a G2A - GFP fusion of LeCPK1 protein . The disruption of one acylation site ( G2 ) in AtCPK2 was reported to result in only a partial loss ( 50 % ) of membrane association ( Lu and Hrabak , 2002 ) . sGFP is strongly expressed throughout the cytoplasm in both unstressed ( Fig . 4G ) and stressed ( Fig . 5M ) ice plant epidermal cells . SGFP exhibits no PM localiza - tion ( Fig . 4G ) , suggesting that PM localization is not being driven by the sGFP portion of the McCPK1 - sGFP fusion . Given the potential for CDPK myristoylation , Ca 2 1 binding may affect conformational changes in the modiﬁed protein that change the accessibility of the attached myristoyl group , leading to increased membrane afﬁnity in a mechanism known as the Ca 2 1 - myristoyl switch ( Zozulya and Stryer , 1992 ) . Real - time imaging of a GFP - tagged visinin - like protein 1 ( VILIP - 1 ) in living cells showed that this protein fusion undergoes a Ca 2 1 - myristoyl switch enabling it to localize to distinct membrane compartments ( Spilker et al . , 2002 ) . A similar observation was repor - ted for recoverin , a myristoylated Ca 2 1 sensor in retinal rod cells ( Ames et al . , 1997 ) . Recoverin has a compact three - dimensional structure consisting of two domains , each of which harbors one functional and one nonfunctional EF hand . Each EF hand be - comes occupied by Ca 2 1 in a sequential process , wherein one functional EF hand is occupied ﬁrst , triggering a rearrangement of the domain interface and subsequent binding of Ca 2 1 to the other functional EF hand . Occupation of both sites leads to the full exposition of the buried myristoyl group ( Matsuda et al . , 1998 ; Permyakov et al . , 2000 ; Senin et al . , 2002 , 2003 ) . McCPK1 may operate in a similar way ; how - ever , detailed structural analyses of myristoylated McCPK1 in the presence and absence of Ca 2 1 are needed to conﬁrm this hypothesis . McCPK1 Subcellular Localization under High and Low Relative Humidity Conditions To gain a better understanding of the subcellular location of the McCPK1 - sGFP , we conducted a series of colocalization studies with well - characterized marker protein - GFP fusions . Previously , Patharkar and Cushman ( 2000 ) demonstrated that McCPK1 - sGFP undergoes a change in subcellular localization from the PM to the nucleus following 4 h of 0 . 5 M NaCl stress treatment to the plant . However , McCPK1 - sGFP also localized to other unidentiﬁed subcellular structures besides the nucleus . To conﬁrm the locali - zation of McCPK1 to the PM in plants grown under 80 % relative humidity ( unstressed conditions ) , we coexpressed McCPK1 - DsRed fusions with the AHA2 ( Arabidopsis plasma membrane H 1 - ATPase ) - GFP fu - sion , a PM marker ( kindly supplied by Dr . Jeffery Harper , Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , CA ) . McCPK1 - DsRed colocalized with AHA2 - GFP ( Fig . 5 , A – C ) . To identify the subcellular structures to which McCPK1 localized following exposure to plants under Chehab et al . 1438 Plant Physiol .

All rights reserved . 40 % relative humidity ( low - humidity stress ) condi - tions for 13 h ( Fig . 5E ) , we cobombarded McCPK1 - DsRed fusions with the ER marker BiP - GFP ( kindly provided by Inhan Hwang , Gyeongsang National University , Korea ; Kim et al . , 2001 ) . McCPK1 - DsRed colocalized with the ER marker in large part consistent with subcellular fractionation studies ( see below ) ; however , there was also partial colocalization with ﬁlamentous structures ( Fig . 5 , D – F ) . The structures resembled the transcytoplasmic ER under the control of the actin cytoskeleton ( Boevink et al . , 1998 ) , so we next tested if McCPK1 - DsRed would colocalize with well - known cytoskeletal components . First , we coex - pressed McCPK1 - DsRed fusion with the microtubule marker tubulin - GFP ( kindly provided by Seiichiro Hasezawa , University of Tokyo ; Kumagai et al . , 2001 ) and observed little colocalization ( Fig . 5 , G – I ) . Next , we coexpressed McCPK1 - DsRed fusion with actin microﬁlament marker talin - GFP ( kindly provided by Nam - Hai Chua , Rockefeller University , New York ; Rees et al . , 1990 ; McCann and Craig , 1997 ; Kost et al . , 1998 ) and observed nearly complete colocalization ( Fig . 5 , J – L ) . Control panels show sGFP subcellular localization in an epidermal cell from an ice plant grown at 40 % relative humidity ( Fig . 5M ) , and DsRed subcellular localization in an epidermal cell from ice plants grown at 80 % relative humidity ( Fig . 5N ) or 40 % relative humidity ( Fig . 5O ) . In summary , McCPK1 - sGFP or McCPK1 - DsRed fusions undergo a pronounced shift in subcellular location from the PM to the ER , the nucleus , and actin microﬁlaments in plants transferred from high to low relative humidity conditions , respectively . The diverse subcellular local - ization of CDPKs throughout the plant cell suggests that different CDPK isoforms regulate distinct signal - ing pathways . In the case of McCPK1 , environmental changes , such as salinity stress ( Patharkar and Cush - man , 2000 ) and reductions in relative humidity result in a dynamic change in the subcellular location of the kinase from the PM to the nucleus , the transcytoplas - mic ER , and the actin microﬁlaments ( Fig . 5 , B and E ; O . R . Patharkar and J . C . Cushman , unpublished data ) . Subcellular Fractionation Subcellular localization studies using GFP fusion may not reﬂect a biologically relevant subcellular location due to the large size of the GFP , which may inﬂuence the ﬁnal destination of the fusion protein Figure 5 .

Therefore , we conﬁrmed the subcellu - lar localization patterns obtained using McCPK1 - sGFP or McCPK1 - DsRed fusions by conducting subcellular fractionation studies with McCPK1 tagged with a much smaller epitope tag . The ORF of McCPK1 was cloned in front of a 6 3 His tag under the control of cauliﬂower mosaic virus 35S promoter . Plasmid DNA containing McCPK1 - 6 3 His - tag fusion gene was introduced into ice plant epidermal cells by micro - projectile bombardment , and then epidermal tissue was resolved into soluble , tonoplast , ER , and PM fractions by Suc step gradient centrifugation ( Barkla et al . , 1995 ; Vera - Estrella et al . , 1999 ) or into a nuclear fraction by isolating intact nuclei ( Cushman , 1995 ) . Protein fractions were resolved by SDS - PAGE and analyzed by western blotting using a monoclonal antibody raised against the 6 3 His tag . This mono - clonal antibody cross - reacted with a single 60 - kD polypeptide that corresponds to the predicted mass of the McCPK1 - 6 3 His - tagged gene product . We observed that the McCPK1 - 6 3 His - tag fusion protein localized primarily to the PM and ER in leaves from plants subjected to 80 % relative humidity ( unstressed conditions ; Fig . 6 ) . However , in leaves exposed to 40 % relative humidity ( stressed conditions ) , the McCPK1 - 6 3 His - tag fusion protein localized to the PM , ER , and nucleus ( Fig . 6 ) . The isolation of the PM , ER , and tonoplast fractions was conﬁrmed by probing them with anti - H 1 - ATPase antibodies ( Pardo and Serrano , 1989 ) , anti - BiP antibodies ( Anderson et al . , 1994a , 1994b ) , and anti - V - ATPase antibodies ( Zhigang et al . , 1996 ) , respectively . The isolation of the nuclear fraction was conﬁrmed by probing it with anti - Ras - related GTPase ( RAN ) antibodies ( Melchior et al . , 1993 ; Moore and Blobel , 1993 ; Melchior and Gerace , 1998 ) . The observed change in the subcellular location of the McCPK1 - 6 3 His - tag fusion protein from the PM to the nucleus following the transition from high to low humidity was consistent with the results of sGFP - DsRed fusion localization studies ( Fig . 5 , B and E , respectively ) . These studies also validated the pre - sence of McCPK1 - 6 3 His - tag fusion protein in the ER under both unstressed and stressed conditions , an observation not immediately evident in sGFP - DsRed Figure 6 . McCPK1 - 6 3 His localization in subcellular frac - tions . Epidermal extracts of leaves from ice plants grown in either 80 % ( unstressed conditions , US ) or 40 % ( stressed con - ditions , ST ) relative humidity were fractionated into soluble ( S ) , tonoplast ( T ) , endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , plasma membrane ( PM ) , and nuclear ( N ) fractions . Protein extracts prepared from 30 epidermal peels for the lanes labeled S , T , ER , PM , and from 24 epidermal peels for the lane labeled N were separated by SDS - PAGE and detected using different marker - speciﬁc anti - bodies . Anti - 6 3 His tag , anti - V - ATPase , anti - BiP , anti - H 1 ATPase , and anti - Ran antibodies were used to detect the location of McCPK1 - 6 3 His , or tonoplast , ER , PM , and nuclear envelope markers , respectively .

The localiza - tion of McCPK1 from the PM under unstressed con - ditions to the actin microﬁlaments , transcytoplasmic ER , and nucleus under stressed conditions suggests that McCPK1 is regulating a stress response pathway . The localization of McCPK1 to the nucleus is consis - tent with a previous observation by Patharkar and Cushman ( 2000 ) in which McCSP1 , a substrate for McCPK1 , is localized to the nucleus . Resetting of McCPK1 Localization under Constant Conditions The observed change in the subcellular localization of McCPK1 - sGFP - DsRed - 6 3 His fusion proteins from the PM to the nucleus and actin cytoskeleton following the imposition of either salinity or low - humidity stress suggests that McCPK1 may play a role as a Ca 2 1 sensor responder to these environmental stimuli . We hypoth - esized that , after McCPK1 moves to the nucleus and the cytoskeleton upon the application of stress , it must return to the PM at some later time to sense new environmental changes . This resetting phenomenon is analogous to the prerequisite of repetitive Ca 2 1 sig - naling wherein elevated cytosolic Ca 2 1 concentrations must return rapidly back to a resting state so that cell Ca 2 1 signaling can be repeated ( Trewavas , 1999 ) . Assuming that the default sensing of Ca 2 1 changes by McCPK1 occurs at the PM or other subcellular locations , such as the peroxisome ( Dammann et al . , 2003 ) , McCPK1 must at some point reset to the PM so that it can repeat its sensor - responder role . To test this hypothesis , plasmid DNA containing the McCPK1 - sGFP fusion gene was introduced into ice plant leaves by microprojectile bombardment and the plants were subjected to 40 % relative humidity for 12 h , after which time the bombarded leaves were detached and subjected to constant water , dehydration , or high - salinity ( 500 m M NaCl ) treatment conditions at 40 % relative humidity for an additional 12 h . Directly after detachment , transiently transfected cells were scored for subcellular McCPK1 - sGFP localization . As ex - pected , in only 38 % to 40 % of cells did McCPK1 - sGFP exhibit a PM subcellular localization pattern . By com - parison , in plants held under unstressed conditions ( 70 % – 80 % relative humidity ) , McCPK1 - sGFP dis - played a predominantly PM localization pattern in 88 % to 96 % of cells ( O . R . Patharkar and J . C . Cushman , unpublished data ) . The same leaves were then resur - veyed after 6 and 12 h in water at 40 % humidity ( Table III ) , water deﬁcit stress ( Table IV ) , or high - salinity ( 500 m M NaCl ; Table V ) stress conditions . After 6 h , PM localization increased to 49 % to 62 % of cells . After 12 h , Table IV .

All rights reserved . the trend toward PM localization increased to 65 % to 73 % of cells displaying a predominantly PM subcel - lular localization pattern ( Tables III – V ) . Cochran - Mantel - Haenzel ( C - M - H ) statistical analysis showed that there were signiﬁcant differences in the mean frequency of localization of McCPK1 - sGFP between the PM and the cytoskeleton / nucleus in the cell populations counted either at 0 or 12 h for each of the treatments . The C - M - H statistic for these treat - ments was greater than 7 . 88 , the chi - squared distribu - tion value for 1 degree of freedom at 95 % conﬁdence level ( x 20 : 05 ; 1 5 7 : 88 ) . However , this observation was not true for the cell populations counted at 6 h of treatment because the C - M - H statistic at this time point was less than 7 . 88 for the different treatments . These results show that , in leaves exposed to constant conditions , whether held in water at 40 % relative humidity , or exposed to dehydration or salinity stress , McCPK1 - sGFP changed location from the nucleus , transcytoplasmic ER , and actin cytoskeleton to the PM , ready to repeat the sensor - transducer cycle should another differential stress condition be encountered . Because similar results were obtained under all three conditions , the type of stress treatment used was considered less important than keeping the conditions constant . The resetting of McCPK1 back to the PM following application of constant conditions ensures that the cell can react again to the same or different stresses . Returning plants exposed to low - humidity conditions back to high - humidity conditions results in a reversal of McCPK1 localization from the nucleus , the trans - cytoplasmic ER , and the actin microﬁlaments to the PM within 2 to 4 h ( O . R . Patharkar and J . C . Cushman , unpublished data ) . However , resetting can also occur to a more limited , yet signiﬁcant , extent in leaves held under constant conditions of 40 % humidity , high - salinity , or water deﬁcit stress treatments ( Tables III – V ) . The resetting of McCPK1 might be due to new protein synthesis of McCPK1 moving along the cyto - skeletal structures to reach the PM , or due to move - ment of preexisting protein back to the PM via the cytoskeleton . Future experimentation will focus on discerning these possibilities . MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant Growth Conditions and Stress Treatments Common ice plant ( Mesembryanthemum crystallinum ) seeds were germi - nated in Metromix 200 ( Scotts Sierra Horticultural Products , Marysville , OH ) in agrowthchamberona 12 - hlight ( 26 (cid:2) C ) / 12 - h dark ( 18 (cid:2) C ) cycle . Fluorescent andincandescent lighting providedaphoton ﬂuxdensityof 450to 500 m E m 2 2 s 2 1 . Ten - day - old seedlings were transplanted individually to 1 - L styrofoam pots containing Metromix 200 and irrigated once daily with 0 . 5 3 Hoagland solution . Leaves from 5 - week - old plants were used for detached leaf assays according to Taybi and Cushman ( 1999 ) . Placing the detached leaves in Magenta boxes without nutrient solution imposed drought treatment . Trans - ferring the detached leaves to 400 m M NaCl imposed ionic stress . Plant material was harvested at various times after the start of various stress treatments ( as indicated in ﬁgure legends ) , frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at 2 80 (cid:2) C until use . cDNA Library Construction and Screening A lambda Uni - ZapXR cDNA expression library ( 300 , 000 pfu ) prepared from leaf tissue of plants exposed to 0 . 5 M NaCl stress for 30 h , as described previously ( Forsthoefel et al . , 1995 ) , was screened with a 807 - bp cDNA CDPK probe obtained by RT - RCR using degenerate primers corresponding to the subdomain VIb ( RDLKPEN ) of the protein Ser / Thr kinase catalytic domain ( HanksandHunter , 1995 ; 5 # - GNGATCTNAAGCTNGAAAA - 3 # ) , andaregion between EF hand 1 and EF hand 2 of the calmodulin - like domain ( 5 # - CN ( G / C ) ( A / T ) NCC ( G / A ) TC ( T / C ) TT ( G / A ) TC ( G / A ) AA - 3 # ) , respectively . Posi - tively hybridizing plaques were excised and propagated as plasmids accord - ing to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . Plasmids having the largest inserts were identiﬁed by restriction analysis and sequenced . Isolation and Sequence Analysis of McCpk1 One putative CDPK clone ( designated CH 1 ) having the largest insert was completely sequenced and found to lack an in - frame initiation codon . To recover a full - length cDNA of McCpk1 , the 5 # RACE system ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions , using gene - speciﬁc primer , GSP1 ( 5 # - TGTAGTACACCTTCACATCCTC - 3 # ) and anchoring primer ( 5 # - ( CUA ) 4 GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGG - GIIGGGII - 3 # ) . Total RNA was isolated as previously described ( Taybi and Cushman , 1999 ) . The identity of 5 # RACE products was conﬁrmed by DNA sequence analysis . The nucleotide sequence of both strands of the full - length cDNA ( accession no . AF090835 ) was determined using the dideoxy chain - termination method on an Applied Biosystems 373A automated DNA sequencing system using the Prism Ready Reaction Dyedeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit ( Applied Biosystems Division , Perkin - Elmer , Foster City , CA ) . DNA sequence data were analyzed using the MacVector / AssemblyLIGN sequence analysis programs ( Accelrys , San Diego ) . Database searches were conducted using the National Center for Biotechnology Information network version of BLAST 2 . 0 ( Altschul et al . , 1997 ) . Multiple sequence alignments were conducted with the ClustalX multiple alignment program ( Thompson et al . , 1997 ) . Plasmid Constructs for Recombinant Proteins The vector pET - 30b ( 1 ) ( Novagen , Madison , WI ) was used to express the full - length McCPK1 fusion construct having a 6 3 His tag on its C terminus . The McCpk1 sequence was ampliﬁed by PCR using the following primers ( 5 # - AATTCTAGACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATATGGGGATTTGTGCTA - GC - 3 # and 5 # - ATACTCGAGAATGACTTTGGTAACCGGG - 3 # ) . The ampliﬁed DNAwas digested with Xho I and Xba I and subcloned into the Xho I / Xba I site of the pET - 30b ( 1 ) vector . The cloned fragment was conﬁrmed to be error free by DNA sequencing . The vector pET - 30b ( 1 ) ( Novagen ) was used to express the myristoylation mutant of McCPK1 fusion construct having 6 3 His tag on its C terminus ( McCPK1 - 6 3 His ) . The McCpk1 sequence was ampliﬁed by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase and the following primers : 5 # - AATTCTAGACTTTAA - GAAGGAGATATACATATGGCGATTTGTGCTAGC - 3 # and 5 # - ATACTCGA - GAATGACTTTGGTAACCGGG - 3 # and cloned as above . The three different constructs expressing McCPK1 mutants , S62A , S420A , and S62A / S420A , were prepared using the QuikChange site - directed muta - genesis kit ( Stratagene ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Ampli - ﬁcation of the plasmid - expressing S62A McCPK1 - 6 3 His was obtained using wild - type McCpk1 - 6 3 His DNA template and the following primers : 5 # - CCATTAGGATGCCCGCCCCAAAACCAGCCCC - 3 # and 5 # - GGGGCT - GGTTTTGGGGCGGGCATCCTAATGG - 3 # . Plasmids expressing S420A McCPK1 - 6 3 His and S62A / S420A McCPK1 - 6 3 His were obtained using the following primers : 5 # - GATTGGCTCGACTTGGAGCAAAGCTTACT - GAAACTG - 3 # and 5 # - CAGTTTCAGTAAGCTTTGCTCCAAGTCGAGC - CAATC - 3 # . For the single - mutant S420A McCpk1 - 6 3 His , wild - type McCpk1 - 6 3 His DNA was used as a template , whereas for the double - mutant S62A / S420A McCpk1 - 6 3 His the mutant construct S62A McCpk1 - 6 3 His was used as the template . All site - directed mutation constructs were conﬁrmed to be correct by sequence analysis before and after conducting kinase activity measurements . Chehab et al . 1442 Plant Physiol .

RNA Isolation and Semiquantitative RT - PCR Assays Semiquantitative RT - PCR assays were conducted as previously described ( Taybi and Cushman , 1999 ) using 1 . 25 m g or 91 ng of DNase I - treated RNA for McCpk1 and Fnr1 products , respectively . A 850 - bp amplicon was obtained using McCpk1 - speciﬁc primers : 5 # - AAACTACCACCAGCAGCC - 3 # ( forward ) and 5 # - TTGAGCAGCAGTAATCCG - 3 # ( reverse ) . A 600 - bp amplicon was obtained using Fnr1 - speciﬁc primers : 5 # - ATTGCCAGCAGGCCCTTG - 3 # ( for - ward ) and5 # - GAACCAGTCAATACCATCT - 3 # ( reverse ) . RT - PCRreactionwas conducted in a 25 - m L reactioncontaining 10m M Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 3 ) , 50m M KCl , 2 . 5 m M MgCl 2 , 10 m M dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 100 m M each dNTP , 400 n M forward primer , 400 n M reverse primer , 20 units of RNase Out ( Invitrogen ) , 0 . 5 unit of Taq DNA polymerase ( Fisher Scientiﬁc , Pittsburgh ) , and either of RNA for McCpk1 or Fnr1 ampliﬁcation , respectively . Reactions were conducted using a PTC - 200 thermal cycler ( MJ Research , Watertown , MA ) at 50 (cid:2) C for 30 min , at 94 (cid:2) C for 2 min to denature the RT , followed by either 21 PCR cycles for Fnr1 or 30 PCR cycles for McCpk1 : 95 (cid:2) C for 1 min , 94 (cid:2) C for 15 s , either 50 (cid:2) C for Fnr1 or 57 (cid:2) Cfor McCpk1 for30s , 72 (cid:2) Cfor45s , and5minofextensionstepat72 (cid:2) C . After ampliﬁcation , the reaction products were resolved by electrophoresis on the same1 . 2 % ( w / v ) agarosegelandstainedwithethidiumbromide . Imageswere captured using a Gel - Doc 1000 DNA Gel Analysis and Documentation system ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) . All semiquantitative RT - PCR experi - ments were repeated twice and representative data were shown . Expression and Puriﬁcation of McCPK1 Transformed Escherichia coli cells ( BL21 ) expressing a wild - type or mutated version of McCPK1 were grown overnight at 37 (cid:2) C in 2 mL of Luria - Bertani / kanamycin medium ( 50 m g / mL ) , transferred to 250 mL of Luria - Bertani / kanamycinmedium , andcultureduntilOD 600 was0 . 7 . Expressionwasinduced by the addition of 1 m M isopropyl thio - b - D - galactoside for 1 h . Cells were harvested , resuspended in ice - cold B - PER lysis buffer ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) , and proteins were collected as speciﬁed by the manufacturer . The fusion protein was puriﬁed by afﬁnity chromatography with nickel resin ( Novagen ) thathadbeenpreparedbyprerunningitwithchargebuffer ( 50m M NiSO 4 ) and thenwithbindingbuffer ( 5m M imidazole , 0 . 5 M NaCl , 20m M Tris - HCl , pH7 . 9 ) . After loading the column with the recombinant protein , it was washed with washbuffer ( 60m M imidazole , 0 . 5m M NaCl , 20m M Tris - HCl , pH7 . 9 ) andeluted withelutionbuffer ( 1 M imidazole , 0 . 5 M NaCl , 20m M Tris - HCl , pH7 . 9 ) . Protein concentrationsweredeterminedbyBradfordassays . Thepurityofallrecombi - nant proteins was judged to be within 6 20 % of the wild - type control . Myristoylation Analysis of McCPK1 The cDNAs encoding either McCPK1 or L1R , a vaccinia viral protein known to be myristoylated ( Franke et al . , 1990 ) , in pET30b or pBR322 , respectively , were transcribed under the control of the bacteriophage T7 promoter and translated in a T7 TNT Coupled Transcription / Translation Wheat Germ Extract system , as speciﬁed by manufacturer ( Promega , Mad - ison , WI ) . Radiolabeling was performed with [ 35 S ] Met ( 50 m Ci of 1194 Ci / m M ; Amersham - Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) , [ 3 H ] Myristic acid ( 48 m Ci of 55 Ci / m M ; Amersham - Pharmacia Biotech ) , or [ 3 H ] Palmitic acid ( 48 m Ci of 55 Ci / m M ; Amersham - Pharmacia Biotech ) . Labeled translation products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 12 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel . The gels were ﬁxed for 30 min in 10 % ( v / v ) acetic acid and 30 % ( v / v ) methanol , rinsed brieﬂy in distilled water , then treated with Enlightning Autoradio - graphy Enhancer ( NEN Life Science Products , Boston ) , dried , and subjected to autoﬂuorography at 2 70 (cid:2) C using Biomax MS x - ray Film ( Eastman - Kodak , Rochester , NY ) . Anti - 6 3 His - tag monoclonal antibodies ( BabCO , Richmond , CA ) were used at a 1 : 1 , 000 dilution in 1 3 Tris - buffered saline ( TBS ; 20 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 137 m M NaCl ) to immunoprecipitate the [ 35 S ] - and [ 3 H ] - labeled McCPK1 - 6 3 His - tag fusion proteins . Antigen - antibody complexes were collected with protein A agarose beads ( Santa Cruz Biotech , Santa Cruz , CA ) and washed as speciﬁed by the manufacturer , resolved on a 12 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel , and visualized by autoﬂuorography . Kinase Activity Assays The protein kinase activity of the fusion protein ( McCPK1 - 6 3 His ) was assayed in a 50 - m L reaction mixture containing 50 m M HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 100 m M KCl , 2 . 5 m M MgCl 2 , 0 . 25 m M EGTA , 0 . 275 m M CaCl 2 , 0 . 1 mg mL 2 1 bovine serum albumin , various concentrations of histone H1 ( product no . 38205 ; Calbiochem , San Diego ) as indicated in Figure 2 , and 40 ng of recombinant McCPK1 . Histone H1 was used at a concentration of 30 m M as indicated in Table II . Reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 m Ci of [ g - 32 P ] ATP ( 60 m M ﬁnal concentration ) and incubated for 15 min at 30 (cid:2) C . Reactions were stopped by spotting 10 m L aliquot on P81 paper ( Whatman , Clifton , NJ ) and washed three times with 150 m M H 3 PO 4 , once with 95 % ethanol , and once with ethyl ether . To determine Ca 2 1 dependence , the above assay buffer was supplemented with 0 . 25 m M EGTA and the amount of free Ca 2 1 was calculated by simple equilibrium calculations from the amount of CaCl 2 supplied . Afterincubationfor 15minat30 (cid:2) C , adding warm SDSsample buffer and boiling for 5 min stopped the reactions . Then , the proteins were separated by 12 % SDS - PAGE and stained with the biosafe GelCode Blue Stain Reagent ( Pierce ) as speciﬁed by the manufacturer . The gel was dried and exposed directly to Hyperﬁlm ECL X - Ray ﬁlm ( Amersham - Pharmacia Bio - tech ) for 12 to 18 h . For quantitative kinase assays , the reactions were stopped by spotting 10 m L aliquot on P81 paper ( Whatman ) and washed three times with 150 m M H 3 PO 4 , three times with 70 % ethanol , and once with ethyl ether . Filters were dried and counted in EcoLume Scintillation Liquid ( ICN , Irvine , CA ) in a liquid scintillation counter ( Liquid Scintillation Systems LS 3801 , Beckman , Fullerton , CA ) . Speciﬁc activities reported are the average of three replicate assays with each of four replicate enzyme preparations . Data are represented as the mean 6 SE of speciﬁc activity . Kinase activity assays contained 50 ng recombinant McCPK1 kinase with or without ( to assay autophosphorylation ) 30 m M histone substrate . ANOVA was performed separately for assays in the presence or absence of calcium , followed by multiple comparison of means by the Tukey’s honestly signiﬁcant difference mean - separation test , using JMP software ( SAS , Cary , NC ) . Determination of McCPK1 Autophosphorylation Sites Puriﬁed , recombinant McCPK1 - 6 3 His fusion protein ( 30 m g ) was auto - phosphorylated in kinase buffercontaining ( 50 m M Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 10 m M MgCl 2 , 1 m M EGTA , 1 . 2 m M CaCl 2 ) with 1 m M ATP at room temperature ( approxi - mately 22 (cid:2) C ) for 24 h . The protein concentration was kept at 1 mg mL 2 1 to improve stability of reaction components during the long reaction time . The kinase ( 30 m g ) was pelleted with acetone , dissolved in 8 M urea , then diluted to 1 . 5 M urea with 50 m M ammonium bicarbonate , pH 7 . 5 , 1 m M DTT . Proteo - lysis was initiated by the addition of 0 . 5 m g of sequencing - grade trypsin ( Promega ) and incubated at room temperature for 14 h . The entire digest was subjected to puriﬁcation using a C18 Zip Tip ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) prior to being loaded onto a two - dimensional ( SCX / C18 ) microcapillary column . Three C18 eluting gradients were performed following the loading of increasing concentrations of 250 m M and then 1 M ammonium acetate . The phosphopeptides in question were eluted using 250 m M ammonium acetate . Samples were analyzed on a Micromass Q - TOF2 mass spectrometer ( Waters , Milford , MA ) equipped with an in - house liquid chromatography - nanoelec - trospray source . Transient Transfection and Fluorescent Microscopy The McCPK1 - sGFP and DsRed constructs were prepared as described previously ( PatharkarandCushman , 2000 ) . TheGtoAmutantatposition2for McCPK1 - sGFP was generated using the QuickChange site - directed mutagen - esis kit ( Stratagene ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol , as described above using wild - type McCPK1 - sGFP plasmid DNA as template and the following primers : Forward primer : 5 # - ATAGTCGACAAGATGGCGATTTG - TGCT - 3 # and reverse primer : 5 # - ATACTGCAGTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTC - CATGC - 3 # . The deletion amino acids 1 – 70 construct was created by the PCR reaction using Taq DNA polymerase and forward primer : 5 # - ATAGTCGA - CAAGATGGGTAAACCCTTTGAGG - 3 # and reverse primer : 5 # - ATAAGAT - CTTGCTCCTGCTCCTGCTCCTGCTCCTGCTCCAATGAGTTTGGTAACCG - GG - 3 # . The ampliﬁcation product was digested with Sal I / Bgl II and inserted into the Sal I / Bam HI site of the 35S - sGFP - TYG - nos ( pUC19 ) vector kindly provided by Jen Sheen ( Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston ) , resulting in the creation of a McCPK1 - sGFP fusion wherein the truncated McCPK1 and sGFP proteins were separated by a ﬂexible ( GA ) 5 repeat linker .

Five - week - old ice plants were bombarded with a hand - held Helios Gene Gun ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) according to the manufacturer’sinstructions , except that afterDNAwas precipitatedonto gold particles , thegoldwaswashedﬁvetimeswithabsoluteethanol . Eachshotﬁred contained 0 . 2 mg of 1 . 6 - m m gold particles . A force of 1 , 034 kPa was used to deliver the gold particles to leaves on intact plants . A diffuser screenwas used to minimize tissue damage . Cobombardment of McCPK1 - DsRed and each of tubulin - GFP , talin - GFP , and BiP - GFP constructs was accomplished by coating the0 . 2mgofgoldwith0 . 8 m gMcCPK1 - DsRedand0 . 2 m goftheGFPconstructs . Plants were grown under unstressed conditions in an environment that maintained 80 % relative humidity . To stress the plants , they were removed fromthishigh - humidity environment , bombarded , and then placed in a lower humidity environment ( approximately 40 % relativehumidity ) for 13 h . Whole leaves were excised from plants and individual cells visualized with a Nikon Eclipse E400 epiﬂuorescence microscope ( Nikon , Tokyo ) . GFP was visualized with a 450 - to 490 - nm excitation ﬁlter , a 495 - nm dichroic mirror , and a 500 - to 550 - nm emission ﬁlter . DsRed was visualized with a 528 - to 553 - nm excitation ﬁlter , a 565 - nm dichroic mirror , and a 600 - to 660 - nm emission ﬁlter . Cell Fractionation The construct expressing McCPK1 - 6 3 His in pET30b was excised and cloned between the Xho I and Sac I sites of the vector p35MCS kindly provided by Nam - Hai Chua ( Rockefeller University , New York ) , thus putting the construct under the control of 35S promoter . Five - week - old plants were bombarded with the construct expressing McCPK1 - 6 3 His . Each shot was composed of 0 . 2 mg of 1 . 6 m m gold particles and 1 m g of plasmid . The epidermal peels from 30 shots of the bombarded area were harvested and homogenized in 2 mL of ice - cold homogenization buffer . The homogenization buffer consisted of 30 m M Tris , 50 % ( w / v ) bovine serum albumin , 10 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 0 . 25 m M butylated hydroxytoluene , 1 . 0 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride , 5 . 0 m M EGTA , 5 . 0 m M MgSO 4 , 0 . 25 m M mannitol , 2 . 0 m M K 1 - metabisulﬁte , 0 . 25 m M dibucaine , 1 . 0 m M benzamidine , and 5 % ( w / v ) soluble PVP ( PVP - 10 ) adjusted to pH 8 . 0 with H 2 SO 4 . All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 (cid:2) C . Membrane fractions were isolated and puriﬁed as de - scribed by Barkla et al . ( 1995 ) . The microsomal portion was fractionated through a discontinuous Suc gradient , the tonoplast and the PM were collected at the 0 to 31 % and the 31 % to 38 % ( w / v ) Suc interfaces , respectively . The ER fraction was collected at the 38 % to 44 % interface . After fractionation , membranes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 2 80 (cid:2) C in 30 - m L aliquots .

All subsequent manipulations were conducted at 4 (cid:2) C . Homogenate was ﬁltered through two layers of Miracloth and then through a series of nylon meshes of decreasing size ( 54 m m , then 25 m m ) . Ten percent ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 was gradually added dropwise to the ﬁltrate to a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 4 % ( v / v ) . The resulting solution was incubated on ice for 5 min to solubilize the chloroplast membranes . The lysate was overlaid onto a two - step gradient consisting of 25 % to75 % PercollpreparedinNIBwithoutTritonX - 100 , andwascentrifuged at2 , 000 g for20min in aswinging bucketrotor ( SorvallHB - 4 ; SorvallProducts , Newtown , CT ) . Using a serological pipette , the nuclei , which appeared as a white ﬂuffy band at the 25 % to 75 % Percoll interface , were carefully removed , resuspended with three volumes of NIB , and centrifuged at 1 , 000 g for 10 min in a swinging bucket rotor ( Sorvall HB - 4 ) , then resuspended again in 2 mL of NIB andcentrifuged at 1 , 000 g for 10 min to removeresidualPercoll . The ﬁnal nuclear pellet was resuspended in 50 m L of nuclei storage buffer , aliquoted , frozen and stored at 2 80 (cid:2) C .
