Studies of the actin - based motility of the intracellular pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella ﬂexneri have provided impor - tant insight into the events occurring at the leading edges of motile cells 1 – 5 . Like the bacteria Listeria and Shigella , vaccinia virus , a relative of the causative agent of smallpox , uses actin - based motility to spread between cells 6 . In contrast to Listeria or Shigella , the actin - based motility of vaccinia is dependent on an unknown phosphotyrosine protein , but the underlying mecha - nism remains obscure 7 . Here we show that phosphorylation of tyrosine 112 in the viral protein A36R by Src - family kinases is essential for the actin - based motility of vaccinia . Tyrosine phos - phorylation of A36R results in a direct interaction with the adaptor protein Nck 8 and the recruitment of the Ena / VASP family member N - WASP 9 to the site of actin assembly . We also show that Nck and N - WASP are essential for the actin - based motility of vaccinia virus . We suggest that vaccinia virus spreads by mimicking the signalling pathways that are normally involved in actin polymerization at the plasma membrane . We began our investigation into the mechanism of actin - based motility of vaccinia virus by identifying the phosphotyrosine protein observed at the site of actin assembly 7 . Western - blot analysis reveals that three prominent proteins , pTyr200 , pTyr80 / 85 and pTyr50 , consistently become tyrosine phosphorylated during vaccinia infection ( Fig . 1 ) . Western - blot analysis and immuno - precipitation experiments identiﬁed pTyr80 / 85 as the actin - binding protein cortactin 10 ( data not shown ) , which is known to be enriched in the cell cortex and becomes phosphorylated by c - Src when Shigella enters the cell 11 . To determine whether tyrosine phos - phorylation of pTyr200 , pTyr80 / 85 and pTyr50 was dependent on actin tail formation , we examined the phosphorylation pattern of cells infected with the recombinant viral strains D A34R , D A36R and D F13L , which do not induce actin tails at 8 hours post - infection 12 , 13 . We found that pTyr50 was absent in cells infected with a recombi - nant virus lacking A36R ( Fig . 1 ) . Western - blot analysis of two - dimensional gels and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that pTyr50 and A36R are the same protein ( data not shown ) . The vaccinia A36R protein is a type Ib integral membrane protein with a cytoplasmic domain of about 200 amino - acid residues 13 that plays letters to nature 926 NATURE | VOL 401 | 28 OCTOBER 1999 | www . nature . com W R ∆ F 13L ∆ A 34 R ∆ A 36 R un i n f ec t e d P - Tyr A36R * + 210 111 83 46 Cortactin + M r ( K ) Figure 1 Vaccinia A36R protein is tyrosine phosphorylated .

To study the role of A36R phosphorylation in vaccinia actin - based motility , we tested whether ectopic expression of the wild - type A36R protein in D A36R infected cells would rescue actin tail formation . Ectopic expression of A36R resulted in both tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein and efﬁcient rescue of actin tail formation ( 111 6 36 % ) ( Fig . 2a , c ) . Expression of point mutants of the six individual tyrosine residues in the A36R cytoplasmic domain showed that only a change of tyrosine 112 to phenylalanine ( A36R mutant Y112F ) resulted in a dramatic reduction of actin tails ( Fig . 2b ) . However , western - blot analysis revealed that mutation of either tyrosine 112 or tyrosine 132 reduced A36R phosphoryla - tion , indicating that both of these residues are phosphorylated ( Fig . 2c ) . As A36R – Y112F still rescues actin tail formation , albeit at low levels , we produced the double point mutant , YdF , in which both residues 112 and 132 were changed to phenylalanine . Although expression of A36R – YdF was similar to the other point mutants , we found no evidence for either tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein or rescue of actin tail formation ( Fig . 2b , c ) . Lack of rescue was not due to mistargeting , as A36R – YdF localized to the intracellular enveloped form of vaccinia virus , which is responsible for actin tail formation 6 ( data not shown ) . In parallel with studies using A36R point mutants , we examined the ability of several A36R deletion constructs to rescue actin tail formation ( Fig . 2d ) . The only requirement for actin tail formation was the presence of tyrosine 112 , which represents a good Src - family kinase phosphorylation site 15 . Vaccinia infection also induces phosphorylation of cortactin , a well known Src substrate 10 , so we tested whether this family of kinases phosphorylates A36R . We found that the Src - family kinase - inhibitor PP1 ( ref . 16 ) reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of both A36R and cortactin , as well as reducing actin tail formation ( Fig . 3a ; and data not shown ) . However , PP1 did not affect viral assembly or A36R localization ( data not shown ) . In addition , expression of c - Src kinase ‘dead open’ mutants 527 Kin - and KP Kin - reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of A36R and actin tail formation ( Fig . 3a , b ; and data not shown ) . When expressed at low levels , 527 Kin - and KP Kin - were observed at the site of vaccinia actin tail formation , which is consistent with their dominant - negative activity when overexpressed ( Fig . 3c ) .

This analogy is strengthened by the localization of the adaptor protein Nck 8 at the site of vaccinia actin tail formation ( Fig . 4a ) . Nck recruitment was dependent on both A36R and its phosphorylation , as it was absent in D A36R infections , with or without ectopic expression of A36R – YdF ( data not shown ) . In vitro binding assays using peptides corresponding to residues 105 – 116 of A36R demonstrate that recruitment of Nck to the virus occurs through the direct inter - action with A36R and is dependent on phosphorylation of tyrosine 112 ( Fig . 4b ) . Furthermore , overexpression of the Nck SH2 domain resulted in a dramatic reduction of actin tail formation ( Fig . 4c ) . The involvement of Nck raises the question whether its downstream partner WASP 8 , 17 , 18 is also required for vaccinia actin tail formation . We found that N - WASP 9 , a member of the Ena / VASP family , is recruited to the virus ( Fig . 4a ) . N - WASP was also efﬁciently recruited from cell extracts by the Nck – A36R - phosphorylated peptide complex ( Fig . 4b ) . As observed with the Nck SH2 domain , overexpression of a dominant - negative construct , N - WASP – D WA 19 , inhibits actin tail formation ( Fig . 4c ) . The require - ment of N - WASP , which is known to stimulate the actin - nucleating activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex 20 , 21 , seems to provide the ﬁnal link to achieve vaccinia actin tail formation . Nck and N - WASP , together with the Arp2 / 3 complex , are also observed on clathrin - coated vesicles that can nucleate little actin tails 7 ( Fig . 4 ) , indicating that this complex of proteins plays an important role in initiating actin polymerization in the cell . Vaccinia virus therefore achieves actin - based motility by mimick - ing the receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathways that control actin polymerization at the plasma membrane . The sequence conservation between vaccinia A36R and its homologue A39R in variola virus , the causative agent of smallpox , indicates that variola virus also used actin - based motility to spread between cells . This Src - family kinase - dependent signalling pathway may also account for other cellular effects induced by vaccinia infection , including induction of cell motility , loss of contact inhibition and changes in cell adhesion , all of which are reminiscent of a transformed pheno - type 22 , 23 . We suggest that vaccinia virus provides an excellent model system inwhich to study Src - family kinase and the signalling pathways that affect actin polymerization , adhesion and cell motility .

The resulting PCRproduct wasclonedintothe Xho I – Hin dIIIsitesof Not I - deﬁcientpBluescriptSKIIto generate the pELA36R construct . Tyrosine - to - phenylalanine point mutations of A36R wereengineeredby‘roundtheworld’PCR 26 usingpELA36Rasatemplate . ThepELA36R – YdF construct was engineered in the same way using A36R – Y112F as the template . The deletion mutants N109 and N117 were generated by introducing a stop codon after residue 109 and 117 , respectively , and are named according to the remaining sequence , that is , amino - terminal to their ﬁnal carboxy - terminal residue ( Fig . 2d ) . We took advantage of a unique SnaB1 site , which immediately follows the transmembrane ( TM ) domainofA36R ( residues1 – 32 ) to generateinternaldeletions byPCR . Internaldeletions TM109C and TM125C are deﬁned by the presence of the transmembrane domain followedbytheﬁrstresidueofthecytoplasmicdomain ofA36R ( 109or125 ) extendingto the C terminus ( Fig . 2d ) . pEL dominant - negative expression constructs Eco RI – Bam HI inserts containing the c - Src mutants 527 Kin - and KP Kin - were cloned intothe Eco RI – Bgl IIsitesofthepELA36Rvectorbackbone .

EGFP was ampliﬁed by PCR from the pEGFP - N1 expression vector ( Clontech ) and cloned into the Bgl II – Xho I sites of pEL immediately downstream of the viral promoter . The DNA coding residues 1 – 397 of rat N - WASP 9 were then ampliﬁed by PCR and cloned into the Not I – Eco RI sites of the pELGFP vector to generate pELGFP N - WASP – D WA , which lacks the WH2 and acidic domains of the protein 19 . TheDNAcorresponding to the SH2 domain , residues275 – 373 , of human Nck1 and the full - length protein were ampliﬁed by PCR from a HeLa cDNA library and cloned in an identical fashion to N - WASP – D WA into pELGFP . The ﬁdelity of all pEL constructs was conﬁrmed by sequencing .

Similarly , PP1 wasaddedtocellseither beforeinfectionorup to 4hourspost - infection . Rescue of actin tail formation or inhibition efﬁciencies were determined from over 200 infected cells in 4 independent experiments based on criteria described previously 7 . All data were normalized to WR or A36R rescue experiments where appropriate , and error bars indicate standard deviation of the mean . Protein expression and invitrobinding Human Nck1 was cloned from pELGFP into the vector pMW172 , expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) , and the soluble fraction prepared as described 27 .

Genomic imprinting is characterized by allele - speciﬁc expression of multiple genes within large chromosomal domains 1 that undergo DNA replication asynchronously during S phase 2 , 3 . Here we show , using both ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization analysis and S - phase fractionation techniques , that differential replication timing is associated with imprinted genes in a variety of cell types , and is already present in the pre - implantation embryo soon after fertilization . This pattern is erased before meiosis in the germ line , and parent - speciﬁc replication timing is then reset in late gametogenesis in both the male and female . Thus , asynchronous replication timing is established in the gametes and maintained throughout development , indicating that it may function as a primary epigenetic marker for distin - guishing between the parental alleles . Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) analysis on interphase nuclei can be used to assay the replication properties of individual alleles in nonsynchronously growing cells 4 . For most gene regions , one observes either two single or two double hybridization dots per nucleus , indicating that both alleles replicate at about the same time in S phase . In contrast , FISH analysis of mono - allelically expressed sequences , such as imprinted genes 2 or olfactory receptor genes 5 , reveals a large number of nuclei in which one allele has already replicated while the other has not , thus indicating asynchronous replication . Interestingly , this pattern is regional and is found in a variety of cell types independent of expression 2 , 3 , suggesting that it is also preserved during development . Imprinted gene regions have a parent - of - origin speciﬁc replica - tion pattern 2 , 3 . In contrast , the olfactory receptor gene loci replicate in a random manner ; in some cells the paternal allelereplicates early , whereas in others the maternal allele replicates early 5 . This latter pattern is similar to that seen with the X chromosome in female cells . Although the FISH approach provides a good measure of replica - tion timing and a sensitive way to detect allelic asynchrony 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 , we wanted to show directly that imprinted genes do replicate with an asynchronous pattern , as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) analysis of pulse - labelled BrdU DNA 8 from S - phase - sorted cell fractions 9 . As shown in Fig . 1a , the human Igf2 gene in EBV - transformed lymphocytes replicates in a broad peak covering the middle of S phase . Use of a restriction - site polymorph - ism to distinguish between the two alleles , however , shows that one chromosomal copy clearly replicates before the other despite con - siderable overlap ( Fig . 1a ) . In a similar experiment , we characterized the replication properties of the mouse Igf2r gene using an Abelson - transformed pre - B - cell subclone from Spretus / Musculus F 1 mice ( Fig . 1b ) . Here , the replication pattern of each allele is clearly separable . As the pedigree of these cells is known , this system also allowed us to prove that it is the paternal Spretus allele that replicates early 2 . Unlike the FISH methodology , which detects the sharp endpoint of replication , the resolving power of cell - cycle fractionation tech - niques is low , probably because DNA replication may not initiate at exactly the same time within every individual cell , and because there is considerable overlap in the ﬂuorescence - sorted S - phase fractions . This might help explain why in studies using similar techniques , but based on fewer S - phase fractions , the Igf2 / H19 locus did not appear to replicate asynchronously 10 , 11 . In fact , a careful visual re - examina - tion of the raw data from one of these studies 10 reveals allelic differences very similar to those seen in our own PCR analyses . Thus , these results indicate that FISH analysis provides a reliable and accurate method for detecting asynchronous replication , and has the advantage that it can be used on small cell populations in vivo .
