For that purpose the effects of CK - 548 , CK - 636 ( inhibitors of actin - related protein complex Arp2 / 3 , whose activation triggers rapid actin polymerization and the formation of the " comet - like " tail on the actinic filament ) and wiskostatin ( an N - WASP protein inhibitor , activating Arp2 / 3 ) on the depression of ACh - current were studied . The attenuation of ACh - current depression was observed upon the addition of CK - 548 . At the same time , CK - 636 and wiskostatin irreversibly strengthened the depression of this current and suppressed its spontaneous recovery . The results of CK - 548 action and its mathemat - ical modeling allow suggesting the presence of " comet - like " transport of acetylcholine receptors , initiated by Arp2 / 3 protein complex in receptor endo - and exocytosis in command neurons of He - lix lucorum in a cellular analog of habituation . Irreversible inhibition of vital metabolic processes of the neuron by wiskostatin and CK - 636 , which lead to the decrease in the level of ATP , could have caused irreversible effects of these blockers on current depression .

Pivovarov et al . 134 1 . Introduction Habituation is one of the forms of learning , when a repeated stimulus that is constant in value causes a gradual reversible decrease of an animal’s response [ 1 ] . Habituation teaches animals to ignore stimuli that are no longer new or have lost their biological significance . The repeated tactile stimulation of Helix lucorum leads to a re - versible decrease in the level of the animal’s defensive response [ 2 ] . We are investigating the cellular mechanism of habituation on command neurons’ defensive behavior of Helix lucorum by using cellular analog of habitua - tion . Repeated tactile stimulus is replaced by rhythmic application of equal portions of acetylcholine ( ACh ) to the soma of a command neuron . Instead of the animal’s defensive behavior we are recording the command neu - ron’s electric reaction ( inward current induced by ACh , ACh - current ) [ 3 ] caused by the movement of chloric ions through the membrane [ 4 ] . According to the research , reversible suppression of ACh - current of Helix lucorum ’ s command neurons’ de - fensive behavior in habituation cellular analog depends on the reduction of membrane acetylcholine receptors ( AChR ) in the ACh application zone due to the endocytosis intensification and exocytosis attenuation [ 5 ] [ 6 ] . These changes in the number of membrane receptors take place by involving the cytoskeleton elements - actin microfilaments and microtubules [ 5 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] , as well as neuronal enzyme systems—protein kinases and protein phosphatases [ 8 ] - [ 10 ] . Two mechanisms of actin microfilament participation in endo - and exocytosis are possi - ble . The first mechanism ensures receptor transport by motor proteins myosins , traveling along the actin fila - ments in either direction by means of vesicles . The other proposed mechanism operates without myosin motors through the process of actin polymerization . In this case , extracellular signal is transmitted to actin cytoskeleton via membrane receptors and G - proteins , leading to rapid actin polymerization in the zones of lamellipodium and filopodium formation ( various types of pseudopodia ) or to rapid polymerization of tension fibers that transect a cell of actin filament bundles . Rapid lengthening of actin filaments is accompanied by the appearance of a driv - ing force in the direction of the filament growth . This type of rapid actin polymerization takes place during the movement of fibroblast cells and of certain lower fungi with the assistance of pseudopodia in the direction of ( or opposite to ) the significant signal . During polymerization the actin monomers form a helically - coiled polar fila - ment with differing ends : a pointed ( minus ) end and a barbed ( plus ) end . The initial polymerization stage ( “nuc - leation” ) transforms into the faster stage when monomers bind to the plus end and dissociate from the pointed ( minus ) end . Actin - binding proteins ( CAP proteins ) can block an actively growing plus end , while the other proteins can cut actin filaments , forming new fragments or depolymerize the actin [ 11 ] [ 12 ] . A cell has several actin - related proteins ( Arp ) —Arp1 , Arp2 , Arp3 . It has been discovered that Arp1 is in - volved in the movement of organelles along microtubules , while Arp2 and Arp3 make up the Arp2 / 3 - complex , which has an increased affinity to actin filament minus ends . This complex can both serve as a matrix , where the new actin filaments formation ( nucleation ) takes place , and bind to the lateral sides of the filaments , ensuring their branching . The rapidly growing plus ends of actin filaments are generally turned toward cell periphery , pushing the membrane forward . Arp2 / 3 - complex speeds up actin polymerization by 2 - 3 times . Other proteins are required to activate this complex . The Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome Protein ( WASP ) is one of such activating proteins . WASP is the effector of Rho GTPase Cdc42 and a key component of signal pathways that regulate ac - tin cytoskeleton [ 11 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] . Monomer actin and Arp2 / 3 - complex binding domains are located next to each other at the С - end of the WASP - protein . This ensures their spatial vicinity and can facilitate the process of actin polymerization . G - proteins and other signaling molecules binding domains are located at the N - end of the WASP - protein . This guarantees WASP and its analogs the ability to serve as intermediaries under the influence of numerous forces and the involvement in the transmission of extracellular signal ( on the segment between G - proteins and Arp2 / 3 - complex ) , which activates actin polymerization . The “comet - like tail” ( CT ) is created from the continuously polymerizing actin , whose formation is regarded to ensure intracellular vesicle transport ( endocytosis ) without the participation of motor proteins [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 14 ] . If motor protein sustained transport processes are conducted along the dynamically stable actin filaments ( when the proceeding actin polymerization - depolymerization processes are at an equilibrium ) , then in the case of “comet - like” movement , additional activation of ATP - G - actin monomers is required to initiate a force that would affect the object in motion . So far , there hasn’t a single mathematical model out there that can fully de - scribe how chemical energy within a cell , which is released in the process of actin polymerization , and it is transformed into the energy of force that pushes the moving surface . [ 15 ] . The ATP hydrolysis role in the me - chanism of actin filament branching also has not yet been sufficiently studied . Different molecular models of A . S . Pivovarov et al . 135 cellular organelle motility are based on the opposite assumptions whether the interaction of individual filaments with the filament end is an autocatalytic process or not . According to the models , this difference leads to differ - ent force - speed ratios : low speed even with great force in an autocatalytic model and rapidly gained speed even with little force in a “nucleating” model [ 16 ] . As shown by the studies , “comet - like” movement is characteristic for pathogenic bacteria Licteria monocyto - genes , Shingella flexneri and cowpox virus [ 17 ] [ 18 ] , which are instead of WASP covered by different protein ActA , performing the same function . Both proteins promote the interaction of G - actin and Arp2 / 3 - complex . This interaction leads to the formation and branching of actin filaments . The formation of “comet - like tail” has been observed in Xenopus oocytes ; furthermore , WASP was found on the surface of every vesicle connected to CT . Morphologically these vesicles are identical to cell endosomes [ 19 ] . Significant reduction in endosome motility is observed in HeLa cells . RBL cells demonstrate even a complete blockage of pinosomes actin - dependent mo - tility during the mutation of Ca - binding protein annexin 2 [ 20 ] , which is capable to bind with phosphatidylino - sitol 4 , 5 - biphosphate ( which is part of the mobile vesicle membrane ) and F - actin [ 21 ] . In neurons “comet - like” movement can play a role in cell restructuring e . g . in the cytoplasm adjacent to the section of the membrane that received the extracellular “signal” . In this case it will result in a launch of an entire cascade of membrane and intracellular processes ( one of which is additional activation of actin monomers ) and finally lead to the change of motility and structure of that section of the cell e . g . growth of filopodia or the formation of new spinelets [ 22 ] . Our earlier results allowed us to suspect an existence of radial acetylcholine receptor transport with the in - volvement of myosin motors along actin filaments in command neurons of a land snail ( Helix lucorum ) in a cel - lular analog of habituation [ 23 ] . Given that the presence of N - WASP protein was shown in the neurons of ma - rine mollusk Aplysia [ 24 ] , the possibility of the second aforesaid mechanism of receptor transport by actin fila - ments ( without myosin involvement ) in the neurons of a land mollusk cannot be excluded . This time we focused on testing empirically the possible role of “comet - like” acetylcholine receptor transport , activated by WASP and Arp2 / 3 proteins in the molecular mechanism of change in inward chlorine ACh - current of command neurons of land snail’s defensive behavior in a cellular analog of habituation . The research was performed by means of in - hibitory analysis in electrophysiological experiments as well as mathematical modeling . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Animals Snails , Helix lucorum , were collected locally in the Sevastopol region , the Crimea , Ukraine . Experiments were performed using isolated ganglia preparation at room temperature ( 18˚C - 22˚C ) . Animals were anaesthetized for 30 min in cold saline containing ice and then the circumoesophageal nerve ring was removed for study . Circumoesophageal ganglia were pinned down by steel microneedles , dorsal side up , on a Sylgard ( Dow - Corning ) coated flow chamber , with a bath volume of 1 ml . Chamber was filled with normal Helix saline ( mM ) : NaCl - 100 , KCl - 4 ; CaCl 2 - 10 ; MgCl 2 - 4 , Tris buffer , 10 ; adjusted to pH 7 . 5 - 7 . 7 with HCl . After treatment of the peripharyngeal nerve ring of ganglia with enzyme ( digestase / Seatec / , Russia - Luxem - bourg , 8 mg / 1 . 2 ml , 20 - 70 min at room temperature : 18˚C - 22˚C ) connective tissue sheath covering the ganglia was removed . 2 . 2 . Registration of Transmembrane Ionic Currents Experiments were carried out on identified LPa2 , LPa3 , RPa3 and RPa2 neurons from the left and right parietal ganglia of Helix lucorum . These cells are command elements of withdrawal responses to noxious stimuli [ 25 ] . Cell membrane contains extrasynaptic [ 26 ] and postsynaptic [ 27 ] [ 28 ] cholinergic receptors . Single - barrel glass microelectrodes were pulled using a PUL - 1 puller ( World Precision Instruments , USA ) from Pyrex glass ( 1 . 5 mm outer diameter ) and filled with 2 M potassium acetate ; resistance 4 - 44 M Ω ( 19 . 48 ± 1 . 02 M Ω ; mean ± S . E . M . ) . The electrodes were connected by an Ag - AgCl microelectrode holder ( World Preci - sion Instruments design ) to a Micro - Electrode Amplifier MEZ - 8101 ( Nihon Kohden ) and Voltage Clamp Am - plifier CEZ - 1100 ( Nihon Kohden ) that were used in Virtual Ground Mode for two - electrode voltage clamp ex - periments . A briquette of Ag - AgCl ( Medicor ) was used as a reference electrode . The neurons were clamped at −75 mV . Currents were entered on a PC through the analogous - digital interface L - 154 ( L - CARD , Moscow ) and A . S . Pivovarov et al . 136 recorded using CONAN 3 . 5 software ( InCo , Moscow , Russia ) . In the experiment currents were also recorded on a KSP - 4 ink recorder to assess their dynamics in real time . 2 . 3 . Test Stimulation ACh was applied ionophoretically ( interstimulus interval 5 min ) onto the neuronal soma using the output of the Laboratory Electrostimulator ESL - 2 ( Kaunas Research Institute of Radiometrical Engineering ) isolated from the ground . The ionophoretic solution was as follows : 1 M ACh chloride ( Sigma ) in distilled water ( pH 7 . 0 ) . The re - sistance of the ionophoretic pipette was 10 - 45 MΩ . The reference pipette was filled with normal Helix saline with a resistance of 1 - 5 MΩ . Cationic currents ( 200 - 500 nA ; 0 . 3 - 3 . 0 s ) were passed through a pipette con - taining a solution of ACh chloride from the device connected to Electrostimulator ECL - 2 . Inward current ( ACh - current ) with amplitude up to 50 nA was recorded in response to ACh iontophoresis ( Figure 1 ( A ) ) . Ejection of positive currents through an ionophoretic pipette filled only with distilled water had no effect on the cells . A negative retention current ( 10 nA ) was passed continuously through the ionophoretic pipette in order to prevent spontaneous diffusion of ACh . To estimate the magnitude of input resistance of the neuron the amplitude of the leakage current caused by hyperpolarizing shift ( 10 mV ) of the holding potential was measured . Rectangular current pulse duration of 5 s from the output of the electrical stimulator ECL - 2 for 10 s prior to application of ACh ( Figure 1 ( A ) ) was used . Input resistance of neurons was 2 - 8 MΩ . 2 . 4 . Drugs CK - 548 , CK - 636 , inhibitors of the Arp2 / 3 protein complex , which activates the formation of “comet - like tail” on the ends of actin microfilaments , and wiskostatin , an inhibitor of N - WASP protein , which activates the Arp2 / 3 protein complex , were used in this paper . All compounds were of Sigma production . Substances were diluted in dimethyl sulphoxide ( DMSO , Sigma ) and applied extracellularly . Maximum ex - pected concentration of DMSO in the flow chamber was 0 . 1 % . Substance exposure prior to the start of the series was 60 min . All series were conducted in stopped - flow conditions . 2 . 5 .

The first 10 stimuli of the series were applied with 3 - min intervals , while stimuli 11 - 13 were applied with 5 - min intervals . Degree and rate of the spontaneous re - covery in a series of reduced ACh - current were assessed based on the values of ACh - current at ACh applications 11 - 13 . The kinetics of changes in ACh - current in the control series ( without pharmacological effects ) included the following phases : 1 ) the current decay phase ; 2 ) the plateau phase of current amplitude stabilization at a re - duced level , and 3 ) the spontaneous current recovery phase ( Figure 1 ( B ) ) . The results were obtained for 49 neurons ( 4 LPa2 , 16 LPa3 , 22 RPa3 , 7 RPa2 ) in 49 experiments . The mem - brane potential of cells was ( −75 ) - ( −22 ) mV ( −56 . 06 - 1 . 12 mV ) ; the holding potential was ( −75 ) mV . 2 . 6 . Statistical Analyses Normalized values are presented as an arithmetic mean of the sample ± standard error of the mean . Computer programs Systat 13 , Sigma Stat 3 . 5 ( Systat Software , Inc . , USA ) were used for statistical processing . The signi - ficance of group differences was evaluated beforehand by using one way repeated measures analysis of variance ( One Way RM ANOVA ) . If authentic effect differences were found in groups , pairwise comparisons of group means were conducted ( blocker - assisted and against control groups ) by using Fisher’s LSD test . Nonparametric Mann - Whitney Rank Sum test was used to compare average ACh - current amplitudes in two groups ( experi - mental and control ) after equal time delays following the start of the series . Differences were considered statis - tically significant with P ≤ 0 . 05 . 2 . 7 . Mathematical Modeling A mathematical model that takes into account different receptor locations—on cell membrane and extracellular , inside the formed and recycled vesicles—was used to analyze experimental data . Also taken into account were the transport of receptors from endoplasmic reticulum to the membrane and the process of receptor degradation . Transfer of receptors between different states were determined by the rate of membrane receptor transport to forming vesicles ( k 1 ) and the rate of their possible yield from those vesicles ( k 2 ) , rates of endocytosis ( k 3 ) and exocytosis ( k 4 ) receptors , rate of receptor transport from endoplasmic reticulum ( k 6 ) , and the rate of receptor de - gradation ( k 5 ) . The choice of rate constants of transition was based on experimental data , according to which the time constant of receptor endocytosis was about several minutes , while that of exocytosis was 2 - 3 times longer . Mathematical modeling came down to solving a differential equation system that described the change of re - ceptor location . The equation parameters were the rates of change in receptor location . Based on the degree of parameter variation , we made conclusions about the influence of investigated inhibitors on various transfer of receptor . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Effects of CK - 548 , CK - 636 and Wiskostatin on ACh - Current in a Cellular Analog of Habituation The effects of blockers of the dynamics of ACh - current amplitude during a series of repeat ACh applications were analyzed : 1 ) average rate of ACh - current decay it approached the plateau phase ; 2 ) level ( degree ) of ACh - current depression ( current amplitude in the plateau phase ) ; 3 ) degree of spontaneous recovery of ACh - current amplitude . Group differences of substance effects on the level of ACh - current depression and its spontaneous recovery ( following the cessation of a series of frequent ACh applications , in comparison with background ) were highly significant ( one - way RM ANOVA , F [ 4 , 34 ] = 186 . 728 , P < 0 . 001 ; F [ 4 , 32 ] = 4 . 431 , P = 0 . 009 ) . ANOVA did not reveal significant group effect of the used inhibitors on the rate of ACh - current depression ( F [ 4 , 44 ] = 1 . 645 , P = 0 . 189 ) . The results of a pairwise group comparison ( post blocker effect and in the control group ) are presented in the Table 1 . СК - 548 ( n = 9 , 50 µM ) reduced the rate ( nonsignificant ) and decreased the degree of ACh - current depression ( P < 0 . 001 ) without changing spontaneous current recovery ( Table 1 , Figure 2 ) . СК - 636 ( n = 10 , 50 µM ) and wiskostatin ( n = 8 , 5 µM ) had a similar effects on the ACh - current depression curve - they increased the degree of depression ( Р < 0 . 001 , P < 0 . 001 ) , while decreasing its level , but did not A .

Both blockers suppressed spontaneous recovery of ACh - current amplitude ( P = 0 . 039 , P = 0 . 019 ) ( Table 1 , Figure 3 and Figure 4 ) . Moreover , in a number of experiments wiskostatin re - pressed ACh - current completely until the end of the series with no recovery . Irreversible suppression of ACh - current in series with СК - 636 and wiskostatin could be the result of blocker concentrations used in the experi - ment , where they caused a cytotoxic side effect . To exclude that possibility , we checked the effects of these compounds in lower concentrations : СК - 636 ( 25 µM ) , wiskostatin ( 2 . 5 µM , 1 . 0 µM , 0 . 5 µM ) . Lowering СК - 636 and wiskostatin concentrations did not cancel the irreversible ACh - current depression in a series . A . S . Pivovarov et al . 139 Figure 3 .

Calculated Curves of the Action of СК - 548 , СК - 636 and Wiskostatin on the Number of Membrane Acetylcholine Receptors in a Cellular Analog of Habituation Results for the effect of СК - 548 , obtained by a mathematical model , which we used earlier for modeling the A . S . Pivovarov et al . 140 impact of various transport process blockers on ACh - current depression , showed that it is possible to obtain a theoretical curve similar to the experimental curve by decreasing the rate of location changes for receptors k 3 , k 6 by 1 . 1 , and k 1 , k 4 by 1 . 5 and 1 . 3 , respectively ( Figure 5 , curve 2 ) . For the effect of СК - 636 and wiskostatin the theoretical curves similar to the experimental ones were obtained with a significantly smaller reduction of all rates of change ( Figure 5 , curves 3 , 4 ) . To obtain curve 3 ( which modeled the effect of СК - 636 ) rate constants were solely reduced by 4 - 6 times , while to obtain curve 4 ( which modeled the effect of wiskostatin ) we applied two - stage reduction of rate constants—an initial 1 . 5 - fold reduction and a secondary 4 - 6 - fold reduction 20 mi - nutes later ( as for curve 3 ) ( Figure 5 ) . 4 . Discussion In planning this experiment , we suggested that the use of inhibitors of key proteins of “comet - like” movement— i . e . , wiskostatin ( IC 50 = 5 µM [ 29 ] [ 30 ] ) , described as a selective and reversible N - WASP protein inhibitor , as well as СК - 548 and СК - 636 - inhibitors of the actin - related protein complex Arp2 / 3 , will help us to determine the role of an alternative method of endo - and exocytosis of receptor - containing vesicles ) . According to research , the actin polymerization rate ( dependent on Arp2 / 3 protein complex activity ) declined respectively by 2 . 3 and 1 . 6 times after CK - 548 and CK - 636 at 50 µM treatment [ 31 ] . CK - 636 is inbuilt between Arp2 and Arp3 , inhi - biting the formation of their active complex , while CK - 548 binds itself to Arp3 on its hydrophobic nucleus , which leads to the change of conformation , which blocks the appearance of branched polymerization of actin and “comet - like” transport . However , the analysis of the obtained results showed that whereas the uses of СК - 548 allows us to examine the possibility of the alternative method of vesicle movement , the use of wiskostatin and СК - 636 raises the issue of nonselectivity of these inhibitors . Thus , according to mathematical modeling , the reduction of the rate of ACh - current depression stabilization caused by СК - 548 is associated with a 1 . 1 - 1 . 5 - fold reduction of receptor transport rates . Since the reduction applies not only to receptor endocytosis , but also to their exocytosis and transport along the membrane to forming vesicles , and it raises the question about the mechanisms that lie at the basis of such a reduction . We know that the binding of Arp2 / 3 complex to the lateral sides of actin filaments leads to their branching [ 11 ] . That is why a reduction of such branching ( as a result of inhibitor effect ) can lead to a reduction of both the rate of receptor transport with the use of motor proteins and the rate of “comet - like” movement . The results obtained allow us to suggest the possibility that “comet - like” radial transport of extrasy - naptic acetylcholine receptors in Helix neurons is involved in a cellular analog of habituation . However , in this study , it is not possible to draw a conclusion about the share of each of the two types of vesicle - containing re - ceptors . We can’t count it because 1 ) rates of receptor transport along the membrane and of receptor exocytosis change along with receptor endocytosis rate change ; and 2 ) according to our earlier studies , inhibition of light Figure 5 . Mathematically modeled curves for the number of membrane acetylcholine receptors which are assumed to determine the depression of acetylcholine - induced in - ward current . 1—control ( without pharma - cological influence and after actions of 0 . 1 % DMSO , both curves are identical ) ; 2 , 3 , 4—after actions of inhibitors CK - 548 ( 2 ) , CK - 636 ( 3 ) , wiscostatin ( 4 ) . A . S . Pivovarov et al . 141 myosin chains likewise led to the reduction of the rate of ACh - current depression stabilization [ 23 ] . The use of another Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitor - СК - 636 and a N - WASP protein blocker , wiskostatin , in our work had another effect—an irreversible suppression of ACh - current until its complete blockage in individual experiments . Decrease in СК - 636 and wiskostatin concentrations did not change their effects . Mathematical modeling showed that the correspondence between the theoretical and experimental curves can be obtained by reducing all rates of receptor transfer between various cell parts by 4 - 6 times . Such a significant reduction of all transfer rate constants simultaneously allows us to speak about these inhibitors blocking the processes vital to the neuron , which affect substance transfer ( as the rate of receptor transfer along the membrane changes as well ) . The absence of ACh - current recovery following cessation of a frequent ACh application in a series allows us to conclude that this blocking is irreversible . The hypothesis about nonselective N - WASP blocking by wiskostatin is confirmed by the results of a number of articles . In particular , significant ( by 80 % ) suppression of induced chloride currents of HT29 - CL19A line ep - ithelial cells with wiskostatin in concentrations ( 5 - 10 µМ ) [ 32 ] is similar to the ones used in our paper . The au - thors believe this effect to be the result of wiskostatin destroying actin cytoskeleton . The use of wiskostatin in liver cells caused rapid dose - dependent reduction in the level of АTP [ 33 ] . In particular , reduction of ATP level by 20 % of control was obtained after a one hour of wiskostatin treatment at 10 µM ( similar to thе wiscostatin concentration in our experiments ) . The conclusions drawn in the present paper exclude its use as selective N - WASP blocker , since wiskostatin suppresses all liver cell functions effectively and nonselectively , including transmembrane transport , as a result of ATP level reduction . We believe that the concordance of wiskostatin and СК - 636 effects on ACh - current depression in our experiments can likewise be due to the reduction of neuron ATP level by these blockers . It is well known that certain chemical substances are respiration and phosphorylation uncouplers and they lead to a decrease in ATP level inside a cell [ 34 ] . Uncouplers are usually lipophilic substances that pass easily through a membrane’s lipid layer . One of such substances is 2 , 4 - dinitrophenol . By their stereochemical formulae wiskostatin and СК - 636 like 2 , 4 - dinitrophenol are the derivatives of aromatic hydrocarbons , which are capable of protonating . Consequently , they can also be respiration and phosphorylation uncouplers in mitochondria , and lead to the reduction in neuron ATP level . The different effects of СК - 548 and СК - 636 on ACh - current depression curve were unexpected to us , since , according to scientific publications , both compounds selectively block the same Arp2 / 3 complex , even though they belong to two different low molecular compound classes that bind to different sites of Arp2 / 3 , thus pre - venting its function [ 31 ] . It is possible that the small differences in the structure of these inhibitors account for the fact that СК - 636 can lead to irreversible decrease in ATP level in neurons , while СК - 548 cannot . The com - parison of crystal structure of Arp2 / 3 complex with bound CK - 548 and CK - 636 [ 31 ] proves this assumption . During the interaction with Arp2 / 3 complex the CK - 636 benzene rings have nearly flat structure as well as the CK - 548 benzene rings are situated in different planes . Such geometry of benzene rings in CK - 548 molecule seems to prevent proton release and therefore CK - 548 is not a respiration and phosphorylation uncoupler . It is possible that a similar irreversible decrease in the ATP level caused by the use wiskostatin is the reason for its non - selectivity , although according to the publications , it is considered extremely selective inhibitor of protein N - WASP . Taking into account this characteristic of wikostatin , we have chosen it as a selective N - WASP blocker for our experiments .
