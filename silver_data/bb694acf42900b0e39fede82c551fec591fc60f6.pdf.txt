Our goal was to investigate lectins recognizing the glyco - sphingolipid globotriaosylceramide ( Gb3 ) for their potential as carriers for transcytotic drug delivery . Methods : We utilized an in vitro model based on Madin - Darby canine kidney cells transfected with Gb3 synthase to characterize transcytosis of the Gb3 - binding lectins LecA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the B - subunit of Shiga toxin ( StxB ) . Results : Both lectins were rapidly transcytosed from the apical to the basolateral plasma membrane and vice versa . Whereas StxB proceeded on retrograde and transcytotic routes , LecA avoided retrograde transport . This differential trafficking could be explained by our observation that LecA and StxB segregated into different domains during endocytosis . Furthermore , inhibiting the small GTPase Rab11a , which organizes trafficking through apical recycling endosomes , blocked basolateral to apical transcytosis of both lectins . Conclusions : Gb3 - binding lectins are promising candidates for transcytotic drug delivery . Our findings highlight that LecA and StxB , which both bind Gb3 but exhibit dissimilar valence and molecular structures of their carbohydrate binding sites and can take divergent intracellular trafficking routes . This opens up the possibility of developing tailor - made glycosphingolipid - binding carrier lectins , which take optimized trafficking pathways .

Introduction In the human body , epithelial and endothelial cell layers form highly selective barriers that allow the maintenance of com - partments with a defined composition of molecules [ 1 ] . The basic elements of these barriers are monolayers of polarized cells . These polarized monolayers can be very efficient in transcytosing endogenous molecules [ 2 ] while in the same time blocking the passage of foreign pathogens and mole - cules . From the perspective of drug delivery , such cellular barriers can therefore represent significant obstacles . One important example is the blood – brain barrier ( BBB ) , which prevents the passage of more than 98 % of small - molecule - based drugs and nearly all large - molecule - based drugs from the blood stream to the central nervous system ( CNS ) [ 3 ] . Diffusion - based drug delivery remains the predominant approach for the majority of drugs utilized today [ 4 ] . In order to compensate for low diffusion efficiencies , this approach requires the administration of high drug doses to ensure that sufficient concentrations reach the target site . In further consequence , this requires additional effort in drug design to minimize off - target effects . An alternative approach is receptor - mediated drug delivery [ 5 , 6 ] . In this strategy , endogenous transcytotic transport path - ways are utilized . The drug is coupled to a suitable ligand that binds to an endogenous host cell receptor on the luminal side of the BBB , which faces the blood stream . The drug - ligand - receptor complex undergoes transcytosis , which results in transport of the drug to the abluminal side facing the CNS . Most transcytotic transport routes that have been suggested for trans - BBB drug delivery rely on proteinaceous receptors , such as the transferrin receptor [ 7 , 8 ] and the insulin receptor [ 5 , 9 , 10 ] . In these cases , the drug carrier has either to compete with endogenous ligands , or when carriers structurally non - related to ligands are used , might still be limited by the default transcytosis rate of endogenous receptor - ligand complexes . An interesting alternative strategy is to utilize glycosphin - golipids as carriers for transcytotic drug delivery . First , glyco - sphingolipids show a very high default transcytosis rate [ 11 , 12 ] , and second , there exist several glycosphingolipid - spe - cific lectins that can induce their own uptake by forming plasma membrane invaginations [ 13 – 17 ] .

The first lectin was the B subunit of Shiga toxin ( StxB ) , which is a homo - pentameric protein with the capacity to bind up to 15 Gb3 molecules [ 22 ] , whereas the second lectin , LecA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a homo - tetramer that contains four Gb3 - binding sites [ 23 ] . Both lectins have been demonstrated to specifically bind to the oligosaccharide moiety of Gb3 [ 24 – 26 ] and to inva - ginate giant liposomes or cell membranes containing the Gb3 glycosphingolipid [ 14 , 27 – 29 ] . We found that StxB as well as LecA were rapidly transcytosed across surrogate model cellular barriers formed by Madin - Darby canine kid - ney ( MDCK ) cells [ 30 , 31 ] that have been transfected with Gb3 synthase . Transcytosis occurred in both directions , from the apical to the basolateral side and vice versa , with similar kinetics . Whereas StxB underwent transcytosis as well as retrograde trafficking to the Golgi apparatus , LecA did only marginally appear at the Golgi apparatus . This is in line with the observation that the two lectins appear to segregate already during the first steps of endocytosis into separate domains . Moreover , we demonstrate that func - tional Rab11a , which is a small GTPase organizing trafficking at the level of apical recycling endosomes ( ARE ) [ 32 – 34 ] , is required for apical delivery during StxB and LecA transcy - tosis from the basolateral to the apical side . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Cell culture MDCK II cells , kindly provided by E . Rodriguez - Boulan ( Weill Cornell Medical College ) , were cultivated in Dulbecco ’ s mod - ified Eagle ’ s medium ( DMEM ) ( Invitrogen ) , supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Invitrogen ) at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Generation of MDCK II cells stably expressing Gb3 synthase ( Gb3 + MDCK ) was performed as described recently [ 29 ] . Briefly , wild - type ( wt ) MDCK II cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding for Gb3 synthase and G418 resistance . Next , cells were selected with 1 mg / ml G418 for 2 weeks and surviving clones were isolated . A clone showing homogenous and high Gb3 expression and ability to form well - polarized monolayers ( assayed by comparing the trans - epithelial electrical resistance ( TEER ) to that of wt MDCK II cell monolayers ) was chosen and utilized for further experiments . To obtain in vitro model barriers , we seeded 3 * 10 5 cells on Transwell filters ( Corning , # 3401 ) with a surface area of 1 . 12 cm 2 , and cultivated the cells for 4 days . To obtain mono - layers that contain only single or small colonies of Gb3 + MDCK cells surrounded by wt cells , we mixed trypsinized and resus - pended wt MDCK II cells with Gb3 + MDCK cells in a ratio 10 : 1 before seeding . To ensure sufficient tightness , only mono - layers showing a TEER > 210 Ω * cm 2 were used for experiments . For checking of the TEER , an Evom2 with a STx2 electrode ( World precision instruments ) was used . 2 . 2 . Bioconjugation of biotin and fluorescent dyes to lectins We utilized NHS - ester - functionalized biotin , Alexa488 , Alexa647 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , and Cy3 ( GE Healthcare ) for bioconjugation to the purified lectins StxB ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and LecA [ 35 ] . Bioconjugation was carried out similar to a previously described protocol [ 15 ] . For the labeling reactions , the following molar ratios were used : 1 : 10 for StxB monomer : biotin , 1 : 20 for LecA monomer : biotin , and 1 : 5 for StxB monomer : fluorophores and LecA monomer : fluorophores . Labeling was car - ried out for 1 h at room temperature ( RT ) in phosphate - buf - fered saline ( PBS ) ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 - mM NaCO 3 ( pH 8 . 2 ) . For double - labeling of StxB with fluorophores and biotin , biotin conjugation was carried out first , followed by conjugation with fluorophores ( ratio 1 : 5 for StxB monomer - biotin : fluorophores ) . Purification of labeled proteins was done with Slide - a - Lyzer TM dialysis cassettes according to the manual provided by the manufacturer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . 2 . 3 . Transcytosis assay To measure transcytosis , 150 µl of complete medium sup - plemented with 4 µg / ml of StxB - biotin - Alexa488 , or 6 µg / ml of LecA - biotin was applied to either the apical or basolateral compartment of Transwell filter - grown MDCK monolayers for 30 min at 4°C . To study the dose dependency of trans - cytosis , StxB - biotin - Cy3 was pre - bound in the following con - centrations : 0 . 04 , 0 . 4 , 1 , 4 , or 10 µg / ml . After removing unbound lectin by washing with ice - cold medium , transcy - tosis was initiated by rapidly warming the cells to 37°C . After the desired time periods , trafficking was stopped by applying ice - cold medium . To detect transcytosed lectins , 150 µl of medium supplemented with 2 µg / ml streptavi - din - Alexa647 was applied at the opposite compartment of the initial lectin application for 30 min at 4°C . Next , cells were washed twice at the side at which streptavidin - Alexa647 had been applied , and then twice at both sides with PBS supplemented with CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 ( PBS + / + ) ( Invitrogen ) . Then , cells were fixed for 15 min at 4°C and then for 15 min at RT in PBS supplemented with 4 % paraf - ormaldehyde ( PFA ) . Fixation was stopped by washing with PBS containing 50 - mM NH 4 Cl . After three washes with PBS , cells were incubated with SAPO buffer ( PBS supplemented with 0 . 2 % bovine serum albumin , 0 . 02 % saponin , and 0 . 5 µg / ml DAPI ) for 30 min at RT . When lectins tagged only with biotin were used , total lectins were counter stained by incubation with 2 µg / ml streptavidin - Alexa488 in SAPO for 1 h at RT . The stained cells on the Transwell filter were mounted on a glass slide with the cells oriented toward the coverslip and embedded in a glycerol solution supplemented with 1 , 4 - diazabicyclo [ 2 . 2 . 2 ] octane ( DABCO ) [ 36 ] . For each condi - tion , at least 36 Gb3 + cells were imaged with a confocal fluorescence microscope ( Nikon A1 R equipped with a 60x oil immersion objective ( N . A . 1 . 49 ) and laser lines at 405 nm , 488 nm , 561 nm , and 640 nm ) . To quantify the amount of transcytosed and totally bound and uptaken lectin , the corresponding intensities were measured from individual 2 S . K . MÜLLER ET AL . cells by analyzing the confocal data with a custom - written Matlab program [ 36 ] . 2 . 4 . Co - localization assays To examine intracellular compartments implicated in transcy - tosis of LecA and StxB , cell culture medium supplemented with 4 µg / ml of StxB - Cy3 or 6 µg / ml LecA - Cy3 was utilized . The experimental procedure was similar as for the transcytosis assays . However , after cells were heated to 37°C for 0 – 120 min to enable transcytosis , samples were washed once with ice - cold medium and twice with ice - cold PBS + / + before they were fixed and permeabilized with SAPO . Intracellular compart - ments were then stained by applying primary antibodies dis - solved in SAPO ( 5 - µg / ml mouse anti - EEA1 ( # E41120 , BD Transduction Laboratories ) to stain early endosomes ( EE ) , 5 - µg / ml rabbit anti - Rab11 ( # 71 – 5300 , Invitrogen ) to stain ARE , 5 - µg / ml mouse anti - giantin ( # ab37266 , Abcam ) to stain the Golgi apparatus ) for 1 h at RT followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies dissolved in SAPO ( 10 - µg / ml anti - mouse - Alexa488 ( # A21202 , Invitrogen ) , and 10 - µg / ml anti - rabbit - DyLight650 ( # 84546 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for 30 min at RT . Then , cells were washed three times with PBS and mounted for fluorescence microscopy analysis . At least 30 Gb3 + cells per condition were imaged with a confocal fluores - cence microscope . To quantify co - localization , the Manders coefficient m1 [ 37 ] , which represents the fraction of the lectin signal that co - localizes with a compartment marker , was deter - mined by analyzing the confocal data with a custom - written Matlab program [ 36 ] . 2 . 5 . Inhibition of Rab11a Rab11a was inhibited by transient co - transfection of polarized wt MDCK cells with dominant negative Rab11a tagged with mCherry ( Rab11a - S25 N - mCherry ) [ 36 ] as well as Gb3 synthase [ 29 ] . Transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) for 6 h . Subsequently , the transfection solution was removed and cells were incubated for further 3 h in complete medium to ensure sufficient expression of Rab11a - S25 N - mCherry before transcytosis assays were started . 2 . 6 . LecA and StxB internalization assays Gb3 + MDCK II cells were seeded on glass bottom dishes and cultured for 1 day to 10 – 20 % confluency . Then , LecA - Alexa488 ( 6 µg / ml ) and StxB - Alexa647 ( 4 µg / ml ) were pre - bound to the cells for 30 min at 4°C and unbound lectins were washed out . After internalization for 0 , 2 , and 15 min at 37°C , cells were fixed with PBS supplemented with 4 % PFA . Cells were imaged at a confocal microscope after one wash with PBS supplemented with 50 - mM NH 4 Cl and two washes with PBS . 2 . 7 . Assay to monitor barrier tightness To monitor if StxB or LecA affects barrier integrity , we mon - itored the TEER using a cellZscope ( nanoAnalytics ) . To this end , cells were seeded on Transwell filters that were inserted in the measuring unit of the cellZscope to continuously record the TEER . Cells were first monitored for 4 days in normal medium to ensure the formation of an intact epithelial mono - layer . Then medium containing 4 µg / ml of StxB or 6 µg / ml of LecA was applied to the apical , basolateral or both compart - ments and the TEER was monitored for another 24 h . The TEER values measured by the cellZscope were lower in comparison to those obtained by the Evom2 , probably because of the different shape , size , or orientation of the electrodes . 2 . 8 . Statistical analysis All results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean ( SEM ) calculated from at least three independent experiments . Statistical significance was analyzed by one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) followed by Bonferroni ’ s post hoc test . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . StxB is rapidly transcytosed from the apical to the basolateral plasma To investigate transcytosis of the Gb3 - binding lectin StxB , we used Transwell filter grown monolayers of MDCK cells stably expressing Gb3 synthase ( Gb3 + MDCK ) as surrogate in vitro model of in vivo barriers like the BBB because MDCK cells are amenable for quantitative light microscopy - based assays of transcytosis [ 38 , 39 ] . We also verified that long - term applica - tion ( > 24 h ) of StxB ( and also LecA ) does not diminish the TEER ( Fig . S1 ) , thus indicating that these lectins do not cause cytotoxic effects that would otherwise lead to a breakdown of the cellular barrier and hence the TEER . This model system enabled us to investigate the receptor - mediated transcytosis kinetics of StxB by using a temperature - controlled transcytosis assay . We prebound StxB - biotin - Alexa488 at 4°C to the apical surface of Transwell filter - grown monolayers of polarized MDCK cells . In order to allow unbiased quantification of signals from individual cells , the monolayers contained only a low amount of isolated Gb3 + MDCK cells that were surrounded by Gb3 - negative wt MDCK cells . After removing unbound lectins by washing , we shifted the temperature to 37°C for periods of 0 – 120 min to enable lectin internalization and intracellular transport [ 40 ] . Following this , transcytosed lectin appearing on the basolateral surface was detected by applying streptavidin - Alexa647 to the baso - lateral side of live cells . In this assay , the 0 - min sample served as internal tightness control for the cell monolayer . Since in this sample no transcytosis to the basolateral side could have occurred , any signal detected from streptavidin - Alexa647 labeling is considered as leakage of the monolayer . To quan - tify transcytosis , we imaged the samples with a confocal fluor - escence microscope , and representative apico - basal cross - sections of individual Gb3 + MDCK cells are shown in Figure 1 ( a ) . Signal from transcytosed StxB was clearly detectable after 30 min of transport . Transcytosis increased significantly for later time points ( Figure 1 ( b ) ) . In addition , we quantified the total amount of StxB - biotin - Alexa488 within the same cells by measuring the signal EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG DELIVERY 3 intensity from the 488 channel ( Figure 1 ( c ) ) . With this , we were able to calculate a transcytosis ( pseudo - ) efficiency ( Figure 1 ( d ) ) by dividing the signal from the 647 channel ( transcytosed StxB ) by the signal from the 488 channel ( total StxB ) for each cell . Due to the different brightnesses of Alexa488 and Alexa647 and unknown labeling efficiencies of StxB - biotin - Alexa488 and streptavidin - Alexa647 , the values given in Figure 1 ( d ) do not represent the real fraction of StxB under - going transcytosis . However , these ( pseudo - ) efficiencies allow relative comparison within one experiment , showing that the transcytosis efficiency saturated after approximately 60 min ( Figure 1 ( d ) ) . Furthermore , StxB remained bound to the cells after appearing at the basolateral surface . This indicates that transcytosis occurred exclusively via vesicular transport . All other scenarios would require a transport of StxB across the lipid bilayer , which is highly unlikely for a protein with a molecular weight like StxB ( 7 . 7 kDa for a StxB monomer ) . To exclude that the observed StxB transcytosis was an artifact resulting from excessive StxB concentrations , we repeated the transcytosis assay for different concentrations of StxB ranging from 0 . 04 µg / ml to 10 µg / ml ( Fig . S2 ) . The total amount of apical or basolateral bound and internalized StxB increased dose dependently ( Figs . S2a and S2d ) . We were able to detect transcytosis after 1 h at 37°C for all used concentrations ( Figs . S2b and S2e ) , but only found a weak dependency of the transcytosis efficiency on the applied StxB concentration ( Figs . S2c and S2f ) . 3 . 2 . The transcytotic route of StxB from the apical to the basolateral plasma membrane It is well established that in many cells StxB is retrogradely transported from the plasma membrane through EE and the Golgi apparatus toward the endoplasmic reticulum [ 27 , 28 , 41 , 42 ] . To study the transcytotic trafficking route of StxB we investigated the co - localization of StxB with intracel - lular compartment markers . In these assays , StxB - Cy3 was pre - bound to the apical plasma membrane at 4°C , followed by 0 min 5 min 60 min 30 min 120 min 15 min ( a ) ( c ) 0 . 0 10 03 2 . 0 10 03 x 1 . 5 x 10 03 S i gn a l i n t e n s it y ( c oun t s ) 1 . 0 x 5 . 0 x 10 02 0 30 90 120 Time ( min ) 60 ( b ) 0 . 0 S i gn a l i n t e n s it y ( c oun t s ) 5 . 0 x 10 03 1 . 0 x 10 04 1 . 5 x 10 04 Time ( min ) 0 30 90 120 60 ( d ) 20 . 0 0 . 0 5 . 0 10 . 0 15 . 0 T r a n s c y t o s i s e ff i c i e n c y ( AU ) 0 30 90 120 Time ( min ) 60 O v e r l a y T r a n s .

Apically applied StxB is transported to the basolateral plasma membrane via transcytosis . ( a ) StxB - biotin - Alexa488 ( green ) was pre - bound to the apical ( AP ) plasma membrane at 4°C for 30 min . Then , the cells were shifted to 37°C for the indicated time periods , and StxB arriving at the basolateral ( BL ) plasma membrane was visualized by staining with streptavidin - Alexa647 ( red ) . After fixation and permeabilization , nuclei were stained with DAPI ( blue ) , and imaged with a confocal microscope . Representative apico - basal cross - sections of Gb3 + MDCK cells surrounded by wt MDCK cells are shown . The intensities of total and transcytosed StxB signals are scaled equally for all time points to allow a direct comparison of the images . ( b ) – ( d ) Time course of transcytosed StxB determined from the signal of basolateral surface staining with streptavidin - Alexa647 ( b ) , total StxB obtained from the signal of StxB - biotin - Alexa488 ( c ) and the transcytosis efficiency calculated from the ratio of surface staining signal to the total StxB signal ( d ) . To calculate the time courses , signals from at least 48 cells per condition were quantified from the microscopy data . The graphs show the average from three independent experiments , the error bars represent the SEM . ( e ) – ( f ) StxB - Cy3 was pre - bound to the apical ( AP ) surface at 4°C for 30 min . Then , trafficking was enabled by heating to 37°C for the indicated time periods . After fixation , the cells were co - stained for compartment markers ( EEA1 as marker for early endosomes in ( e ) , Rab11 as marker for apical recycling endosomes in ( f ) , and giantin as marker for the cis - and medial - Golgi apparatus in ( g ) ) . Representative confocal images for each condition are shown in Figs . S3 – S5 , respectively . The Manders co - localization coefficient m1 , which represents the fraction of StxB co - localizing with a compartment marker , was quantified with a custom - written Matlab program . The graphs show the time courses from n ≥ 3 individual experiments , the error bars represent the SEM . 4 S . K . MÜLLER ET AL . heating to 37°C to enable transcytosis , similarly as described before . After fixation , compartments of interest were stained with appropriate primary and fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies . To quantify co - localization , confocal microscopy was used to acquire z - stacks of two - dimensional images to reconstruct three - dimensional representations of the samples . With a custom - written Matlab program , we calculated the Manders co - localization coefficient m1 from the three - dimen - sional data , which gives the exact proportion of StxB signal co - localizing with a compartment marker . Internalized StxB was first seen to co - localize with EE ( Figures . 1 ( e ) and S3 ) , which have been visualized by staining with an antibody recognizing the early endosomal antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) [ 43 ] . The co - localization between StxB and EEA1 peaked after 15 min of internalization ( Figure 1 ( e ) ) . The co - localization with Rab11 , a marker of ARE [ 1 , 28 , 44 , 45 ] , reached its apex shortly after , at around 15 – 30 min ( Figures . 1 ( f ) and S4 ) . These observations indicate that StxB is taken up and enters the apical recycling system , which is formed by EE and ARE [ 1 , 33 , 46 ] in polarized epithelial cells . Additionally , we investigated the retrograde trafficking of StxB by measur - ing the co - localization of internalized StxB with giantin as a marker for the cis - and medial - Golgi apparatus . As depicted in Figures . 1 ( g ) and S5 , StxB reached the Golgi apparatus within 60 min , and then co - localization between StxB and giantin saturated . The appearance of StxB at the Golgi ( Figure 1 ( g ) ) occurred concurrently with its arrival at the basolateral plasma membrane after transcytosis ( Figure 1 ( c ) ) . This suggests that a fraction of StxB undergoes transcytosis , whereas another frac - tion is transported along a retrograde route . As assessed from the value of the co - localization coefficient after 60 min of transport ( Figure 1 ( g ) ) , approximately 50 % of StxB is trans - ported retrogradely and is therefore not available for transcytosis . 3 . 3 . StxB is also transcytosed from the basolateral to the apical plasma membrane By using our transcytosis assay , we also investigated trans - cytosis of StxB in the basolateral to apical direction ( Figures . 2 ( a - d ) ) . The quantification revealed that Gb3 + MDCK cells expressed on average a lower amount of Gb3 at the baso - lateral plasma membrane ( ( 2 . 25 ± 0 . 46 ) * 10 2 counts signal intensity from bound StxB at 0 min , Figure 2 ( c ) ) than on the apical plasma membrane ( ( 8 . 17 ± 1 . 71 ) * 10 2 counts signal intensity from bound StxB at 0 min , Figure 1 ( c ) ) . Nevertheless , transcytosis from the basolateral to the apical plasma membrane was clearly detectable after 30 min of transport ( Figures . 2 ( a ) and 2b ) . The transcytosis efficiency , calculated as ratio from the signal of transcytosed StxB ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) and totally bound and internalized StxB ( Figure 2 ( c ) ) , reached detectable values after 30 min , increased until 60 min , and then decreased again after 120 min ( Figure 2 ( d ) ) . This decrease might be due to re - internalization of already transcytosed StxB from the apical plasma membrane . 3 . 4 . The transcytotic route of StxB from the basolateral to the apical plasma membrane When internalized from the basolateral plasma membrane , StxB first co - localized with EE ( Figures . 2 ( e ) and S6 ) , showing a peak in co - localization at 15 min , which is similar as in the case of apically applied StxB ( Figure 1 ( e ) ) . The co - localization with ARE peaked only after 30 min of internalization ( Figures . 2 ( f ) and S7 ) , slightly later as for apically applied StxB ( Figure 1 ( f ) ) . This indicates that StxB , which was internalized from the basolateral side , got access to ARE after approximately 30 min , which can also act as exocytic compartment for apical delivery [ 33 , 36 , 38 ] . Similar as in apical to basolateral transcytosis ( Figure 1 ( g ) ) , approximately 50 % of basolaterally internalized StxB follows the retrograde transport route to the Golgi appa - ratus ( Figures . 2 ( g ) and S8 ) . In order to verify the role of ARE as apical exocytic com - partment during basolateral to apical STxB transcytosis , we used overexpression of wt Rab11a - mCherry and dominant negative Rab11a - S25N - mCherry . For these experiments , we had to slightly modify the transcytosis assay . To ensure that all Gb3 - expressing cells were also positive for the Rab11a - variants , a monolayer of wt MDCK cells was transiently co - transfected with Gb3 synthase and Rab11a plasmids according to established protocols [ 36 ] . This resulted in single isolated cells within the monolayer that expressed both Gb3 as well as the Rab11a variants ( Figure 2 ( h ) ) . To maximize the transcytosis signal , we did not wash out StxB in these experiments and kept it in the basolateral compartment during the whole incubation period . As can be seen in Figure 2 ( i ) , overexpres - sion of wt - Rab11a - mCherry lowered the amount of StxB that was able to transcytose from the basolateral to the apical plasma membrane to 20 % after 30 min and 29 % after 60 min compared to cells that were only transfected with Gb3 synthase . Such an effect of overexpression of wt Rab11a has also been observed for apical biosynthetic delivery [ 36 ] , and suggests that Rab11a and ARE play a role in basolateral to apical transcytosis of StxB . Importantly , overexpression of dominant negative Rab11a - S25N - mCherry completely blocked basolateral to apical transcytosis of StxB ( Figure 2 ( i ) ) . Neither overexpression of wt - Rab11a - mCherry nor Rab11a - S25N - mCherry interfered with the uptake of StxB from the basolat - eral plasma membrane ( Figure 2 ( j ) ) . Thus , also the transcytosis efficiencies ( Figure 2 ( k ) ) followed the same trend as the signal from transcytosed StxB . This proves that functional Rab11a and ARE are required for apical delivery of StxB during baso - lateral to apical transcytosis . 3 . 5 . Gb3 also drives transcytosis of LecA The Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin LecA is also able to bind the glycosphingolipid Gb3 [ 25 , 26 , 29 ] . Since LecA has less pri - mary amines than StxB , the NHS - ester - based bioconjugation of both a fluorescent dye and biotin was not feasible with LecA . Therefore , LecA - biotin was utilized and the total amount of bound and internalized LecA was detected by streptavidin - Alexa488 labeling in fixed and permeabilized cells after the transcytosis experiments . EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG DELIVERY 5 As depicted in Figure 3 ( a ) , LecA underwent transcytosis in both directions . Detectable transcytosis signals were seen for the apical to basolateral direction after 30 min ( Figure 3 ( b ) ) and in the opposite direction after 60 min ( Figure 3 ( e ) ) . A larger number of LecA molecules bound to the apical side than to the basolateral side ( Figures . 3 ( c ) vs . 3f ) . This is most likely due to the higher steady - state concentration of Gb3 at the apical side , which has also been observed during the StxB transcytosis experiments ( Figures 1 ( c ) and 2 ( c ) ) . Interestingly , the transcytosis efficiencies in both directions did not saturate after 60 min of transport ( Figure 3 ( d ) for apical to basolateral transcytosis and Figure 3 ( g ) for basolateral to apical transcy - tosis ) as has been observed for StxB ( Figures 1 ( d ) and 2 ( d ) ) . 3 . 6 . Unlike StxB , LecA is not retrogradely transported Also for LecA transcytosis , we performed a co - localization analysis to investigate the intracellular trafficking route . Apically applied LecA showed a clear co - localization with EE after 15 min , which slightly decreased until the end of the experiment after 120 min ( Figures . 4 ( a ) and S9 ) . The co - locali - zation with ARE peaked at 15 min ( Figures . 4 ( b ) and S10 ) . This behavior is different from that observed for apically applied StxB ( Figure 1 ) , suggesting differences in intracellular traffick - ing between LecA and StxB . Indeed , apically applied LecA did not efficiently reach the Golgi apparatus ( Figures . 4 ( c ) and S11 ) , thus suggesting that only a minor fraction of LecA ( < 15 % ) is retrogradely transported . Basolaterally applied LecA showed a very slow increase in co - localization with EE ( Figures . 4 ( d ) and S12 ) and ARE ( Figures . 4 ( e ) and S13 ) , which is again different than the behavior seen for basolater - ally applied StxB ( Figure 2 ) . Also from the basolateral side , LecA was not able to efficiently reach the Golgi apparatus ( Figures . 4 ( f ) and S14 ) . Moreover , we investigated if ARE act as apical exocytic compartment in basolateral to apical transcytosis of LecA .

MÜLLER ET AL . This was indeed the case , as can be seen in Figures . 4 ( g - j ) . Similar as for StxB ( Figures . 2 ( i - 2k ) , overexpression of Rab11a - S25N - mCherry drastically inhibited apical arrival of basolater - ally applied LecA . 3 . 7 . StxB and LecA segregate into distinct membrane structures The experiments before showed that although StxB and LecA were both transcytosed , their intracellular transport was dif - ferent . Whereas approximately 50 % of StxB took the retro - grade transport route to the Golgi apparatus , less than 15 % of LecA appeared at the Golgi apparatus . Therefore , we investigated when a separation between LecA and StxB could occur during the initial steps of uptake . We used non - polarized glass - grown cells for this experiment to enable a clear confocal imaging of the attached membrane . We simul - taneously prebound StxB - Alexa488 and LecA - Alexa647 to Gb3 + MDCK cells at 4°C and shifted the temperature to 37° C for short time periods to shed light on the early events during endocytosis ( Figure 5 ) . Even before internalization was initiated , a partial segregation into distinct domains between LecA and StxB was observed ( Figure 5 , 0 min ) . The segregation became even clearer after 2 min of incubation at 37°C , and after 15 min vesicles appeared that showed both , LecA and StxB , together with vesicles that were positive for only one of the two lectins . This suggests that , despite bind - ing to the same lipid receptor , LecA and StxB spatially seg - regated into separate domains facilitating trafficking along different intracellular routes . 4 . Discussion Our experiments showed that the two Gb3 - binding lectins StxB and LecA undergo transcytosis in a BBB surrogate model based on polarized Gb3 + MDCK cells . A scheme of the model system together with our major findings is presented in Figure S15 . Transcytotic transport was possible in both direc - tions , from the apical to the basolateral side and vice versa . In both directions , transcytosis was mediated by vesicular traf - ficking , because the applied lectins reappeared at the oppo - site surface in a membrane - bound form . The first step for transcytosis in both directions was the internalization into EE . Then , the lectins populated the recy - cling system at the side from which they were internalized , until a fraction escaped to the vesicular trafficking system feeding the opposite plasma membrane . This is best illustrated for basolateral to apical transcytosis . After basolateral interna - lization and co - localization with EE on the basolateral side , the lectins reached the apical trafficking system and arrived at ARE . This compartment has been shown to be involved in apical recycling and apical biosynthetic trafficking [ 1 , 28 , 32 – 34 , 36 , 44 – 46 ] . A crucial role for ARE in basolateral to apical receptor - mediated transcytosis has also been found for trans - cytosis of immunoglobulin A mediated by the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor [ 38 , 47 ] . In line with these observa - tions , we could show that inhibition of ARE by overexpression of dominant negative Rab11a - S25N - mCherry prevented arrival of basolaterally applied lectins at the apical plasma mem - brane . Together with the established role of ARE in transcyto - sis via protein - based receptors [ 2 ] , our finding that ARE are also implicated in transcytosis via lipid - based receptors Rab11 S25N wt Rab11 no cotransf .

( Continued ) EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG DELIVERY 7 suggest that ARE are a central hub for most basolateral to apical vesicular transcytosis pathways . Despite the fact that StxB and LecA both bind Gb3 , their transcytosis kinetics was different . In addition , approximately 50 % of StxB that bound to the apical or basolateral plasma membrane at 4°C was retrogradely transported to the Golgi apparatus . In contrast to that , only less than 15 % of LecA was retrogradely transported . This observation suggests that LecA is preferably transcytosed , whereas only a fraction of StxB does that . In line with the idea that a larger fraction of LecA is available for transcytosis , we observed that the transcytosis efficiency of StxB saturated after approximately 60 min , whereas the transcytosis efficiency of LecA showed no satura - tion within our measurement period of 120 min . During an infection with bacteria secreting Shiga toxin , for example upon intestinal colonization with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli ( EHEC ) [ 48 ] , the toxin does not only affect cells at the site of infection , but efficiently spreads to other tissues to reach the kidney and the CNS , where it inflicts severe damage [ 49 ] . It is interesting to note that this spread requires initial transcytosis across the intestinal epithelium , which has been suggested to occur through macropinocytosis because this tissue is Gb3 negative in healthy humans [ 48 ] .

EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG DELIVERY 9 endothelia including the BBB , which express Gb3 [ 18 – 21 ] , is required . This latter transcytosis most likely occurs through the Gb3 - dependent pathway we describe here , because the macropinocytotic activity of the BBB is very low [ 50 ] . Nevertheless , it seems that StxB has evolved to be able to do both : spreading , which requires transcytosis , and cell intox - ication , which depends on retrograde transport . Our model system replicates this dual nature of Shiga toxin intracellular transport . The molecular mechanism for this differential StxB transport is so far not well understood . It has been shown that the length and degree of saturation [ 14 ] as well as hydroxyla - tion [ 15 ] of the fatty acyl chain of Gb3 influence the receptor – protein interaction [ 13 , 51 , 52 ] . A similar observation has been made by Saslowsky et al . for the transcytosis of cholera toxin ( Ctx ) , which binds to the glycosphingolipid monosialotetra - hexosylganglioside ( GM1 ) [ 17 , 53 ] . They demonstrated that 0 min 2 min 15 min O v e r l a y S t x B L ec A x - y x - z 5 µm 2 µm Figure 5 . StxB and LecA segregate into separate domains during endocytosis .

After fixation , cells were imaged with a confocal microscope . For each condition , a representative x - y cross - section and a corresponding x - z cross - section are shown . White dashed lines indicate the localization of the cross - sections . Zoom - ins from the areas marked with blue squares are also displayed . In the 15 min images , white arrowheads mark vesicles positive only for StxB - Alexa488 , magenta arrowheads indicate vesicles positive only for LecA - Alexa647 , and white arrows mark vesicles showing both , StxB - Alexa488 - and LecA - Alexa647 . 10 S . K . MÜLLER ET AL . Ctx was also able to undergo transcytosis as well as retrograde transport ; however , the portion of Ctx that was transcytosed bypassed the retrograde transport route . In addition , the authors showed that only GM1 species that contained cis - unsaturated or short acyl chains in the ceramide domain were able to transcytose from the apical to the basolateral plasma membrane [ 53 ] . A comparable effect could cause the virtual absence of retrograde transport for LecA compared to the retrograde trafficking of StxB . As for GM1 , several Gb3 species are present in native cell membranes [ 15 ] . Thus , one possible explanation for the observed spatial separation and differential trafficking of LecA and StxB could be that the two lectins preferentially recognize different Gb3 spe - cies . In addition , also the differing carbohydrate - binding site orientation and valence of the two lectins might play a role in causing deviating cellular transport behavior . Finally , we note that the absence of retrograde trafficking for LecA makes this lectin an attractive candidate for transcel - lular drug delivery , because in this case retrograde transport is not desired . In particular , LecA would be an interesting carrier for transcytotic drug delivery across cellular barriers . One example is the BBB , which , as mentioned before , expresses Gb3 [ 18 – 21 ] . The findings presented here provide the basis to test if StxB and LecA are able to cross the BBB in vivo . This will also enable to investigate if the lectins have toxic effects when applied to whole organisms , for which we could not find indications in vitro ( Figure S2 ) . 5 . Conclusions In this study , we investigated glycosphingolipid - specific lectins for their potential as carriers for drug delivery over barriers formed by monolayers of polarized cells , such as the BBB . We found that two lectins that bind Gb3 , StxB , and LecA , are both able to undergo transcytosis in an in vitro surrogate model system of the BBB based on Gb3 + MDCK cells . We unraveled the trafficking route of both lectins by quantifying the sequen - tial co - localization with intracellular compartments . We found that both lectins reach EE after internalization and that ARE are central exocytic compartments during basolateral to apical transcytosis . Whereas StxB underwent both , retrograde trans - port as well as transcytosis , LecA did only marginally enter the retrograde transport route . This makes LecA a promising carrier for transcellular drug delivery that can be combined with estab - lished strategies , like coupling to porous nanoparticles or poly - mers that carry drugs incorporated in their matrix [ 54 – 56 ] , or directly coupling drugs via enzymatically cleavable linkers [ 57 , 58 ] . In addition , these findings demonstrate that lectins with structurally and stoichiometrically differing arrangement of their carbohydrate - binding sites for the same glycosphingo - lipid receptor can take different intracellular trafficking routes . This suggests that there is the possibility to engineer lectins [ 59 , 60 ] that sort themselves into the desired trafficking pathway for drug delivery . Taken together , we propose glycosphingoli - pids as promising new class of endogenous receptors that can be used for efficient lectin - based transcellular drug delivery .
