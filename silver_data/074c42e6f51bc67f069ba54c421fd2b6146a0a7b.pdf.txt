Washington University School of Medicine , 660 South Euclid Ave , Saint Louis , Missouri 63110 , United States Metabolites , typically recognized as small molecules that are involved in cellular reactions , provide a functional signature of phenotype that is complimentary to the upstream biochemical information obtained from genes , transcripts , and proteins . The high - level of correlation between metabolites and phenotype has created a surge of interest in the field that is reflected in the number of metabolomic publications growing from just a few articles in 1999 to over five thousand in 2011 . Although relatively new compared to its genomic and proteomic predecessors , already metabolomics has led to the discovery of biomarkers for disease , fundamental insights into cellular biochemistry , and clues related to disease pathogenesis . 1 , 2 The success of metabolomics over the past decade has largely relied on advances in mass spectrometry instrumentation , which make it possible to detect thousands of metabolites simultaneously from a biological sample . Coupled with developments in bioinformatic tools such as XCMS - Online 3 , 4 , it has now become relatively routine to comprehensively compare the levels of thousands of metabolite peaks in one sample group to another in an untargeted manner . This approach , called untargeted metabolomics , has the potential to implicate unexpected pathways with a unique phenotype or disease process . Despite the attractiveness of having a comprehensive and unbiased approach for profiling metabolites that is analogous to the other ‘omic sciences , an overwhelming proportion of the metabolomics community exclusively uses a targeted platform in which only a specified list of metabolites is measured . The benefit of such a targeted platform is speed . Unlike the untargeted platform , after the targeted mass spectrometry methods are established , minimal effort and resources are required to profile these specific metabolites over a large number of samples . The major bottleneck of untargeted metabolomics , in contrast , has been the challenge of determining the identities of the peaks found to be dysregulated in untargeted profiling data . Traditionally , the untargeted metabolomic platform involves multiple steps as represented in Figure 1 ( bottom ) . The first step is acquiring global mass spectrometry data ( MS 1 ) for each of the samples . Next , these data are analyzed by using bioinformatic software which performs quantitative analysis to find peaks that are significantly changing between sample groups . The investigator then typically searches the mass - to - charge ratio of the peaks of interest manually in metabolite databases . Searches that return hits within the mass accuracy of the instrument are considered putative identifications .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t tandem mass spectral data ( i . e . , MS 2 data ) from the research sample is then compared to that of a commercial standard . To obtain MS 2 data , a targeted MS 2 analysis is typically performed on one of the research samples in which the peak was determined to be up - regulated . The fragmentation pattern of these MS 2 data is then manually compared to the MS 2 data from a commercial standard ( it should be noted that not all commercial standards can be resolved by MS2 data alone , such as stereoisomers ) . To facilitate metabolite identification in the untargeted workflow , in 2004 we launched a freely accessible metabolite database called METLIN 5 ( http : / / metlin . scripps . edu ) which incorporates tandem mass spectral data from model compounds . Recently , other metabolite databases such as the Human Metabolome Database ( HMDB ) 6 , MassBank 7 , and LipidMaps 8 have also begun incorporating MS 2 data for standard compounds . These repositories allow investigators to compare MS 2 data from their research samples to MS 2 data from model compounds catalogued in the database and thereby improve the speed , efficiency , and cost effectiveness of untargeted studies . Over the past 7 years , our objective has been to generate a sufficiently large MS 2 library that could be used in an automated fashion to revise the traditional untargeted metabolomic workflow ( Figure 1 , bottom ) . Since we originally published METLIN in 2005 , we have increased the number of MS 2 spectra included in the database by a factor of 150 . As of April 2012 , METLIN contains tandem mass spectral data on more than 10 , 000 distinct metabolites at 4 different collision energies . These data were collected by using an electrospray ionization - quadrupole time - of - flight ( ESI - QTOF ) mass spectrometer in both positive and negative detection mode , representing a total number of more than 48 , 000 high - resolution spectra . To estimate the current coverage of physiologically relevant metabolites in METLIN and the other 3 largest databases available , metabolites were isolated from E . coli and standard human serum by using defined protocols 9 . Samples were analyzed in both positive and negative mode with an ESI - QTOF mass spectrometer ( see Supplemental Information ) . Each peak detected ( excluding isotopes ) was searched in each of the 4 databases . Figure 2 shows the number of hits for each database and also the subset of these hits for which MS 2 data are available to confirm the metabolite identification . In addition to its increased size , here we describe a new version of the METLIN database that we have developed with advanced functionality to automate metabolite identification and reduce the labor - intensive bottleneck that has traditionally been associated with untargeted metabolite profiling . Instead of comparing MS 2 data from research samples to MS 2 data of commercial standards manually , the new version of METLIN allows metabolomic investigators to upload their MS 2 data to the METLIN database so that the comparisons can be performed in an automated way . By having automated MS 2 matching , metabolite identities can be confirmed much more efficiently and faster compared to the traditional untargeted metabolomic workflow . The quality of the match between the MS 2 data from the research sample and the MS 2 data from the METLIN library is measured by a newly introduced METLIN scoring system , which is based on a modified version of the established X - Rank scoring system 10 . To evaluate the correlation of METLIN MS2 data to MS2 data acquired by using different instrument platforms , a comparative experiment was performed using 23 metabolite standards . The compounds were measured on five different instruments and the resulting spectra were matched against the METLIN database . The correct result was returned based on the X - Rank scoring system as the first hit for 90 out of the 101 spectra ( 89 . 1 % , see Supplemental Information ) . Some classes of metabolites produce characteristic fragments or neutral losses in their MS 2 spectra that can be used as signatures for unique chemical functional groups . For example , the MS 2 spectra of phosphatidylcholines are characterized by a fragment at m / z 184 . 07 . For Tautenhahn et al . Page 2 Nat Biotechnol .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t instances in which the MS 2 data uploaded by a user does not match any compound in the database , the new version of the METLIN database will search the MS 2 data for characteristic fragments that can be used for molecular classification . The search can also be performed manually by accessing the “fragment search” or “neutral loss search” options . These tools provide a novel mechanism by which unknown metabolites can be chemically classified and take advantage of the large number of MS 2 data in the library . To highlight the new database functionalities , we performed MS 2 on select peaks from the metabolite extracts of E . coli and human serum . These MS 2 data were uploaded to the METLIN database and fragment matching was performed by using the automated feature described above . Representative examples of metabolites identified on the basis of MS 1 and MS 2 data by using this method are shown in Supplementary Information . Identified compounds ranged from lipids to smaller , polar metabolites . Additionally , representative examples of unknown compounds that were classified by characteristic fragments are also shown . With the combination of the METLIN functionalities described here and the increasing speed of QTOF instrumentation for performing MS 2 , there is potential to reduce the untargeted metabolomic workflow to just two steps ( Figure 1 , top ) . By using high - scan speed QTOF instruments , MS 1 and MS 2 data can be acquired simultaneously in a single run . Quantitative information can then be extracted from the data by using the bioinformatic software XCMS - Online 3 and metabolites can be identified simultaneously by matching the MS 2 data against the METLIN MS 2 database in an automated fashion , an approach that is self - directed or autonomous in nature . With this truncated workflow , the time needed to perform untargeted profiling and subsequent metabolite identification may be reduced to minutes to hours compared to the days or weeks needed with the traditional workflow . The results shown here from automated MS 2 matching highlight the applicability of the method for performing high - throughput , untargeted metabolomics by using such an accelerated workflow . Moreover , we have shown that the coverage of the METLIN database enables the characterization and identification of thousands of naturally occurring metabolites in biological samples . Thus , the new METLIN database has the potential to expedite the workflow by which we do untargeted metabolomics as more investigators obtain mass spectrometry instrumentation that can produce high - quality MS 2 data with increasing speed and sensitivity .
