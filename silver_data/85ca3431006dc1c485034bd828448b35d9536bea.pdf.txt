This game is extremely interesting since it induces subjects to fall prey into the paradigm of escalation , which is driven by agents’ commitment to higher and higher bids . Indeed , whenever each participant commits himself to a bid , the lower bidder , moved by the wish to win as well as to defend his prior investment , finds it in his best interest to place a higher bid to overcome his opponent . The latter mechanism may lead subjects to overbid , implying that the winner pays more than the auctioned value . The aim of the paper is to analyze bidder’s behavior , comparing individuals vs . groups’ decisions within the dollar auction framework . We find that groups are closer than individuals to the Nash equilibrium , and that experience reduces the escalation phenomenon , but it has a different impact on winners and losers . Key Words : escalation ; winner’s curse . JEL code : C91 * Corresponding author : snuzzo1 @ gmail . com 2 1 . Introduction It is a matter of fact that many decisions are made by groups . Economic , legal and political decisions are recurrent examples . In this sense , whether or not decisions performed by groups are different or superior relative to decisions undertaken by individuals in isolation is still an open question 1 . This paper contributes to the debate studying whether groups’ decisions outperform those of individuals by exploiting the well - known framework of the “Dollar Auction Game” , proposed by Martin Shubikin ( 1971 ) . The game involves a promoter who auctions off a dollar to the highest bidder . The dollar is auctioned through a modified “English Auction” : both the winner and the second - highest bidder have to pay their own bid , but only the highest bidder obtains the dollar . Whenever both players submit a bid , these rules create potential for a perverse mechanism in which players commit themselves to higher and higher bids in order to preserve their prior investment . Then , a mutually reinforcing behaviour might be in place , leading players to fall prey into the overbidding trap , and implyingthe paradox that one - dollar is sold for more than its value . In some way the dollar auction game also resembles the winner’s curse ( Thaler , 1988 ) . The latter is a well - known behavioral bias in which decision makers are naïve and fail to behave rationally in the attempt to acquire an item . As a consequence , and against theory predictions , people systematically end up with loss - making purchases 2 in common value auctions . In its simplicity , the dollar auction game provides a meaningful representation of many economic scenarios , for example that involving companies in a competition for acquiring oil extraction rights . One further example is that of the so called “Concorde Trap” : after the Second World War , US , England , France and the Soviet Union reached an agreement regarding the creation of a supersonic airplane , the “Concorde” . It would have been the first high - speed flight . Even though , due to a sharp increase in production and management costs , the Concorde project was loss generating , the involved States did not break out the venture since they had invested too much in it to leave the table . The latter as well as further evidence 3 show that people decision - making is affected by non - negligible sunk costs , which are reflected in the effort to continue an investment beyond the rationality of a representative profit maximize agent . The origins of sunk costs are not clear at all . Teger ( 1980 ) argues that the sunk costs and self - commitment are , in some way , related to the feel of having invested too much to quit . Thaler ( 1980 ) explains sunk costs in the light of the prospect theory ( Kahneman and Tversky , 1979 ) . Indeed , starting from a reference point , after an unsuccessful investment has been made , people shift somewhere in the convex trunk of their utility function . At that point , while losses do not result in significant decreases in value , gains would lead to large increases in value . Then , risking negligible losses to seek significant gains seems a good deal . Staw ( 1981 ) shows that further commitment after bad decisions does occur since people are averse to admit that prior money was wasted . It is pretty evident as the dollar auction is a powerful game in that it creates potential for detecting and measuring the impact of sunk costs on subjects’ decision making . This is the reason why this article adopts this game to contribute to the diatribe regarding groups and individuals decisions . Are groups more inclined than individuals to avoid overbidding and self - commitment to bad investments ? In this sense , are groups’ decisions superior relative to 1 Comprehensive surveys comparing group and individual decision making can be found in Charness and Sutter ( 2012 ) and Temerario ( 2014 ) 2 eBay auctions , mineral right auctions and corporate takeovers are widespread examples . 3 See Arkes and Blunder ( 1985 ) 3 individuals’ decisions ? To the best of our knowledge , this work is the first shedding light on individuals and group decisions in such a framework . In a class experiment involving seventy people , Murnighan ( 2002 ) auctioned off a 20 $ bill . He reported that , after intensive subjects’ activity , the last two bidders did not stop bidding at the break - even point ( 20 $ ) but they kept on bidding , with the aim of driving the other bidder out . At the end of the game , the winner paid 54 $ for a 20 $ bill . Murnighan ( 2002 ) also reported other very extreme class experiments in which the winner ended up with paying 2 , 000 $ for a 20 $ dollar auctioned value . O’Neill ( 1986 ) shows that upper - bounded bids prevent subjects from falling prey into the escalation phenomenon , since they anticipate the contingency of incurring in a loss . In a revisited version of the dollar auction game , Migheli ( 2012 ) finds that , although escalation does not occur , some participants are willing to pay more than the value of thecoin . He argues that , probably , loss - related costs are counter balanced by the “intangible reward of glory and fame” coming from winning the auctioned good . As far as individual vs . team decision - making is concerned , a wide range of experimental games has been used to investigate whether groups perform better then individuals in isolation . Charness and Sutter ( 2012 ) and Temerario ( 2014 ) provide comprehensive surveys in this area . Results in this field are far from being convergent . Some studies ( see for example Kocher and Sutter , 2005 ) show that groups outperform individuals in a wide set of situations . In line with this strand , Cooper and Kagel ( 2005 , 2009 ) report that groups outcomes in strategic task are sharply better than those of the most skilled member of the group . Blinder and Morgan ( 2005 ) , involving teams and stand - alone individuals in both a statistical urn problem and a monetary policy experiment , support the evidence that not only teams perform better than individuals but , surprisingly , groups decision making is not slower than that of individuals . Then , two heads are better than one . On the other side , some literature ( see Kerr at al . 1996 ) reports no evident differences between teams and individuals decisions . Sutter et al . ( 2009 ) compare three - member groups and individuals decision in an English auction framework with private and common value . Contrarily to previously mentioned literature , they find that groups fall into the winner’s curse trap more frequently than individuals , thus earning lower profits . Sutter et al . ( 2009 ) relate their achievement to a different approach of groups and individuals toward competition , arguing that competition among groups is more ruthless than competition among individuals . In a recent contribution , Casari et al . ( 2015 ) compare three - member groups and individuals’ performance in an “Acquiring a Company” task . In order to track the main forces leading the different choices of groups and individuals , the team decision making process is split up into three steps : first , each subject presents an individual proposal ; secondly , subjects go through a group chat step and , as a last step , the decision itself takes place . Moreover , the difficulty level 4 of the task is changed to provide insights on when groups outperform individuals . Casari et al . ( 2015 ) show that results are crucially task dependent . While in the simple task groups perform better than individuals , since they reduce the winner’s curse and place better bids than stand - alone individuals , in the difficult task individuals decisions are superior relative to those made by groups . This achievement is explained by the evidence that disagreement within a group was generally resolved with the median ( and not with the best , i . e . the “truth wins rule” ) proposal . Then , in the easy task case , groups make better decisions just because the subjects with the wrong answer are the minority . This result provides the interesting evidence that the choice of having individuals or groups as decision unit is strongly context dependent . 4 While in the easy level of the task themajority of subjects can solve the problem , in the difficult version only a minority can succeed . 4 Shupp and Williams ( 2008 ) evaluate risk aversion using price data elicited by a willingness to pay mechanism for risky prospects . They find that the variance of risk preferences is generally smaller for groups than individuals and the average group is more risk averse than the average individuals in high - risk situations . Morone and Morone ( 2014 ) estimated and compared subjects and dyads preferences toward risk 5 . In addition , Morone et al . ( 2012 ) show that subject choices in the first - period play a key role in determining subjects’ behavior in the repeated game , so experience teaches something and the initial choice is crucial in tracking the pathway to follow , and overall , groups behave more rationally , in the sense that they were always closer to the Nash equilibrium . Leavitt ( 1989 ) showed that collective decisions should be more efficient than individual ones . He recognizes three causes to support this idea : it satisfies the human’s need of social membership , groups seem to be more creative than individuals and they are able to correct their mistake , putting toghether different information . In the same year , the psychologist Irving L . Janis came up with a different pattern . He showed that sometime groups convey to a sub - optimal equilibrium caused by impulsive choices . He called his theory “Groupthink” . It is a phenomenon in which the need for agreement and conformity in the group results in an irrational decision - making outcome ; this behaviour can be particularly dangerous if coupled with escalation phenomenon . In the next section we report the experimental design , in section 3 some theoretical background , and our results are presented . Finally section 4 concludes . 2 . Experimental design and lab procedure The experiment was conducted at the ESSE laboratory in Bari and programmed in z - Tree ( Fischbacher , 2007 ) . 48 subjects participated to the experiment , and they were randomly allocated to two different treatments , i . e . an individuals’ treatment ( IT ) and a two - member groups’ treatment ( GT ) . 32 subjects played the group treatment . They were randomly gathered into 16 two - member groups and randomly matched with the same opponent during the whole lab session . Then , eight different auctions took place in the GT . 16 subjects got involved in the IT . Each of them was randomly matched with an opponent and played the whole auction session in isolation against the same opponent . Then , also in the IT , eight different auctions were played . The rules wereas follows : the highest bidder obtained 10 ECU 6 , the lowest bidder lost and had to pay his latest bid . The auction was initially opened for 30seconds ; whenever each subject posted a bid , the time auction was restored for other 30 seconds and , if nobody raised up his bid until the end of the 30 seconds , the auction was stopped and players had to pay according with their latest bids . In each treatment subjects played the game over 10 periods . Thereafter , one period was randomly selected for payment ; the exchange rate was 1 ECU to 0 . 1 € . At the end of each lab session , all participants filled in a questioner . The experimental instructions and the questioner are reported in Appendix A , box A1 and A2 respectively . 3 . Theoretical aspects andExperimental Results The auction is set up as a sequential game . The Nash Equilibrium is reached respectively whenever the faster bidder offers the minimum request to obtain the euro ( i . e . 0 . 1 ECU ) and the opponent leaves the auction . Whether subjects rise up their bids , they will lose the track of their losses . 5 For a thoughtful survey see Temerario ( 2014 ) . 6 The ECU ( Experimental Currency Unit ) is the currency used to conduct the experiment . 5 Our research pursues a dual scope . As a first point , we aim at testing whether the sub - game perfect Nash equilibrium ( SPNE ) solution of the game holds . Since the game theoretical optimal strategy is different for losers ( L ) and winners ( W ) , our analysis keeps the two categories separated . Thereafter , within each category , we focus on both groups and individual decision - making . The second goal is to assess whether groups and individuals’ choices do rely on different underlying criteria , i . e . whether group decisions are on average superior to individual decisions 7 . Following the above schedule , we first test whether our experimental data confirm the theoretical Nash equilibrium prediction of the game . Tables B1 , B2 , B3 , B4 in Appendix B report the bid distribution for each dyad over the ten periods . Data are grouped by winners and losers and , within each of the latter categories , by groups and individuals . Accordingly , descriptive statistics are illustrated in Box - Plot C1 , and Box - Plot C2 in Appendix C . As far as losers are concerned , a one sample t - test ( n = 80 ) is performed to assess whether their bids are , on average , equal to 0 ECU . Similarly , as far as winners are concerned , the one sample t - test ( n = 80 ) is carried out to test whether winners’ proposals are , on average , equal to the minimum allowed value , i . e . 0 . 1 ECU . The analysis is worked out for both groups and individuals . The results show that theory fails . Indeed , both losers and winners’ average bids are significantly diverse from the respective theoretical prediction . This achievement holds 8 for both stand alone and dyad choices ( LGB : t = 7 . 45 , * * * p < 0 . 01 ; LIB : t = 6 . 51 , * * * p < 0 . 01 ; WGB : t = 12 . 64 , * * * p < 0 . 01 ; WIB : t = 8 . 70 , * * * p < 0 . 01 ) . Result 1 : Both groups and individuals do not behave in accordance with the theoretical prediction of the game . Anyway , our first result pushes us further to investigate if subjects’ decisions differ depending on whether people play individually or in groups of two elements . In Figure 1 and Figure 2 we report the period - by - period median bid for both losers and winners , controlling for individual and group play . The black dash line represents the theoretical prediction of the game . 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Period Median Groups Bid Median Individuals Bid Losers Median Bid Trend Figure 1 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Period Median Groups Bid Median Individuals Bid Winners Median Bid Trend Figure 2 7 This evidence is largely supported in the related literature . See , for example , Blinder and Morgan ( 2005 ) 8 Full t - tests are reported in Appendix D 6 Interestingly , we can see that , both in the losers and winners instances , groups median bids are most of the times lower and , hence , closer to the Nash equilibrium than individuals median bids . We perform a two - sample - mean comparison test ( n = 80 , see Table E1 and E2 , Appendix E ) to assess whether subjects’ bids are , on average , lower when the game is played in groups . The results are affirmative . Taking into consideration losers bids , we find that groups bids are , on average , significantly lower than individuals’ bids ( * * p < 0 . 05 ) . The same result is detected when winners’ bids are accounted for ( * * p < 0 . 05 ) . Furthermore , by employing the root mean squared error ( RMSE ) index , we test the error margin between subjects’ bids and the theoretical prediction of the game . The employed measure computes the average squared deviation of actual bids over the theoretical equilibrium value . In other words , the RMSE is used as an index of proximity of the observed bids from theoretical value . RMSE = 1 n B O - B N ( ) 2 i = 1 n å é ëê ù ûú 1 2 where :  B O represents the observed bid  B N represents the Nash equilibrium predicted bid  n stands for the number of observations within each period Then , the more actual bids approximate the equilibrium value , the lower the RMSE is . Accounting for losers , Figure 3 shows the RMSE distribution box - plot of actual bids toward the equilibrium bid . As we can note , when the game is played in groups , the RMSE distribution is downward shifted . Then , groups bids track the theoretical equilibrium closer than individuals bids . A non - parametric Mann - Whitney U test ( n = 10 , table 1 ) shows that this difference is statistically significant ( * p < 0 . 1 ) . 5 10 15 20 25 Losers RMSE Distribution Groups Individuals Figure 3 Table 1 7 Similarly , as far as winners are concerned , figure 4 shows that groups behaviour approximates the theoretical prediction much better than individuals’ behaviour . A non - parametric Mann - Whitney U test ( n = 10 , table 2 ) shows that this result is statistically significant ( * * p < 0 . 05 ) . 5 10 15 20 25 Winners RMSE Distribution Groups Individuals Figure 4 Table 2 Result 2 : In both the winners and losers instances , groups bid closer to the theoretical equilibrium than individuals . In Figure 5 , Table 3 - Figure 6 , Table 4 we report the comparison between losers vs . winners in the two treatments . Indeed losers are closer to the Nash equilibrium in both treatments . This result is in line with the winner’s curse . 4 6 8 10 12 RMSE Distribution LG WG Figure 5 Table 3 8 5 10 15 20 25 RMSE Distribution LI WI Figure 6 Table 4 At the end of the treatment , subjects answer to three simple questions : ( 1 ) “Have you offered more or less than one euro ? ” ; ( 2 ) “Why do you follow this pattern ? ” ; ( 3 ) “Does experience lead you to switch to another strategy ? ” . We report information gathered in the questioner into a “statements cloud” ( see Figure 7 ) , in order to put in evidence the key words and the most meaningful statements . They report that inexperience is crucial in the first periods because they are unaware about the mechanism of the game and the strategy of their opponents . Finally , in some cases a learning process slowed down the size of bids and cleaned their decision - making process up , but sometimes subjects took a wrong position . A sunk cost effect ( in most cases they reveal that they are moved by their wish to minimize the losses ) blind the right equilibrium . Figure 7 : statements cloud 9 4 . Conclusion In this paper we compared individuals and groups behavior in a particular auction , i . e . the dollar auction . We got two results ; ( i ) both groups and individuals do not behave in accordance with the theoretical prediction of the game , but ( ii ) groups bid closer to the theoretical equilibrium than individuals . The escalation of commitment is a topic that regards our daily routine and each decision making process , indeed a great part of our choice is influenced by a sunk cost effects . It is difficult to find a break event point between the cost of our past and the actual benefits of our future gains ( or losses ) . However a collective mechanism takes to a gradual dimming of this problem and it partially succeeds to avoid the paradox of the game . 10 References Blinder , A . S . and J .

You compete against one opponent . The auction rules are as follows : - The promoter auctions off 10 ECU ( Experimental Currency Unit ) ; - The auction follows a competitive mechanism , it will start from a price of 0 ECU ; - In order to win the auction you have to submit at least one bid ; - You have 30 seconds to raise up your latest bid , you can raise your bid by 0 . 1 ECU at a time , there are no upper limits . - If you do not raise up your bid within 30 seconds since your opponent’s bid has been posted , the auction ends . Both the winner and the loser have to pay their latest bid to the auctioneer , but only the winner obtains 10 ECU . You will play the auction 10 times ( periods ) against the same opponent .
