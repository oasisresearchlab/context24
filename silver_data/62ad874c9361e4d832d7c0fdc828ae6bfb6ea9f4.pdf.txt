Abstract The RNA helicase UPF1 interacts with mRNAs , mRNA decay machinery , and the terminating ribosome to promote nonsense - mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) . Structural and biochemical data have revealed that UPF1 exists in an enzymatically autoinhibited “closed” state . Upon binding the NMD protein UPF2 , UPF1 undergoes an extensive conformational change into a more enzymatically active “open” state , which exhibits enhanced ATPase and helicase activity . However , mechanically deficient UPF1 mutants can support efficient NMD , bringing into question the roles of UPF1 enzymatic autoinhibition and activation in NMD . Here , we identify two additional important features of the activated open state : slower nucleic acid binding kinetics and enhanced ATP - stimulated nucleic acid dissociation kinetics . Computational modeling based on empirical measurements of UPF1 , UPF2 , and RNA interaction kinetics predicts that the majority of UPF1 - RNA binding and dissociation events in cells occur independently of UPF2 binding . We find that UPF1 mutants with either reduced or accelerated dissociation from RNA have NMD defects , whereas UPF1 mutants that are more dependent on UPF2 for catalytic activity remain active on well - established NMD targets . These findings support a model in which the kinetics of UPF1 - mRNA interactions are important determinants of cellular NMD efficiency . * Correspondence to : j . hogg @ nih . gov 1 Introduction Eukaryotic cells use mRNA decay to quickly regulate gene expression in response to changing conditions ( 1 ) . In addition to allowing tight kinetic control of gene expression , mRNA decay provides a mechanism by which cells can mitigate the negative effects of genetic mutations or errors in mRNA biogenesis . A prototypical example of an mRNA decay pathway that uses a common set of factors to accomplish both transcriptome surveillance and gene expression regulation is nonsense - mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) ( 2 ) . Together , the targets of NMD have been estimated to compose 5 - 20 % of human genes , and defects in NMD are associated with numerous genetic diseases and cancers ( 3 , 4 ) . At the core of the NMD pathway is the RNA helicase UPF1 , which non - specifically binds RNA ( 5 – 7 ) to act as a protein scaffold for other NMD and translation factors . These include UPF2 ( 8 – 10 ) , the terminating ribosome ( 11 – 13 ) , the RNA endonuclease SMG6 ( 14 – 18 ) , and the RNase - recruiting heterodimer SMG5 / SMG7 ( 14 , 15 , 18 ) . As a superfamily 1 ( SF1 ) helicase , UPF1 harnesses the chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis to translocate 5′ - 3′ on single - stranded RNA , unwind RNA secondary structures , displace proteins from RNA , and dissociate from RNA ( 19 – 23 ) . In the absence of UPF2 , the autoinhibitory UPF1 N - terminal cysteine / histidine - rich ( CH ) domain docks onto the RecA2 domain , reducing ATPase activity . UPF2 relieves UPF1 autoinhibition by interrupting a conserved phenylalanine - isoleucine interaction ( F192 and I757 in human UPF1 ; F131 and I693 in yeast UPF1 ) and rotating the CH domain 120° away from the RecA2 domain ( 10 , 24 ) . In this way , UPF2 binding converts UPF1 from the enzymatically autoinhibited “closed” state to an activated “open” state ( 10 , 24 ) . Correspondingly , mutation of UPF1 F192 to glutamate ( F192E ) biochemically substitutes for UPF2 binding , resulting in constitutively activated UPF1 ( 10 , 24 , 25 ) . Despite extensive biochemical and structural studies , the mechanisms by which cellular NMD is affected by either UPF1 autoinhibition or activation by UPF2 remain largely unexplored . In addition to enhancing UPF1 ATPase activity , UPF2 promotes UPF1 phosphorylation by the PI3K - like kinase SMG1 ( 12 , 13 , 26 ) . Phosphorylated UPF1 in turn stimulates NMD by recruiting SMG6 and SMG5 / SMG7 ( 15 ) . Structural studies have identified a megadalton - scale SMG1 complex ( SMG1C ) consisting of SMG1 , SMG8 , and SMG9 bound to UPF1 and UPF2 ( 26 – 28 ) . In this context , the UPF2 - induced conformational swing of the CH domain has been proposed to 2 facilitate positioning of UPF1 in the SMG1 kinase core ( 26 ) and subsequent release from SMG1C ( 27 ) . UPF2 - induced undocking of the CH domain has also been proposed to reduce UPF1 - RNA interactions . Recently , it was reported that UPF1 - UPF2 - RNA ternary complexes are unstable , due to competition between UPF2 and RNA for UPF1 ( 29 ) . Moreover , the tendency of UPF1 to release RNA upon ATP hydrolysis implies that UPF2 may further disrupt UPF1 - RNA interactions via stimulation of UPF1 ATPase activity ( 30 ) . Consistent with these findings , the UPF1 F192E mutant reduced ATPase - dependent RNA binding in both in vitro assays ( 24 ) and cellular immunoprecipitation experiments ( 5 ) . Enhancement of UPF1 ATPase activity by UPF2 has historically been viewed as a means of promoting decay , but these data imply that this mechanism may also be used to preserve RNA stability by enhancing UPF1 dissociation from potential NMD substrates . The role of UPF1 autoinhibition and activation in the regulation of UPF1 - RNA interactions is of particular interest in light of accumulating evidence that ATPase - stimulated dissociation is a critical mechanism to ensure efficient and accurate NMD . We recently identified UPF1 mutants that are poorly processive , unwind slowly , displace proteins from nucleic acid less efficiently , and have ATPase activity decoupled from unwinding but can still promote efficient NMD of canonical targets ( 31 ) . These data , together with findings of differential rates of UPF1 release from NMD - sensitive and NMD - insensitive mRNAs ( 5 , 32 ) , point towards the ‘butterfly model’ of NMD , which proposes that UPF1 must efficiently dissociate from non - target RNAs but more stably associate with target RNAs to promote NMD . This model predicts that either enhanced or reduced rates of UPF1 ATPase - stimulated dissociation would negatively impact cellular NMD . Accelerated dissociation would reduce opportunities for UPF1 to productively assemble decay complexes in response to translation termination events ( 32 – 34 ) . Conversely , slower UPF1 dissociation would prevent efficient sampling of the transcriptome , exemplified by ATPase - dead UPF1 mutants that lose decay target discrimination ( 5 , 35 ) . Here , we use in vitro biochemical and biophysical assays , computational modeling , and cellular studies to understand the functional significance of the conformational change between the autoinhibited closed state and the activated open state of UPF1 . We find that UPF1 - UPF2 complexes and perpetually open UPF1 mutants have slower nucleic acid association kinetics and faster ATP - dependent nucleic acid dissociation kinetics compared to the closed state of 3 UPF1 . Computational kinetic modeling predicts that the effects of UPF2 on UPF1 - RNA interactions are constrained by UPF2 abundance in cells , such that the majority of UPF1 - RNA association and dissociation events occur in the absence of UPF2 . Furthermore , we characterize previously known and new UPF1 mutants with varying degrees of autoinhibition to understand the biochemical and cellular consequences of switching between the closed and open states . We identify no cellular NMD defects in UPF1 mutants with increased reliance on UPF2 for activation but find that mutants that undergo either accelerated or slowed ATPase - stimulated dissociation have reduced NMD function .

UPF1 is thought to predominantly reside in an enzymatically autoinhibited closed state and transition to an activated open state upon UPF2 binding . Enhancement of UPF1 catalytic activity by UPF2 is a conserved feature of nonsense - mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) ( 21 , 24 , 39 – 41 ) , but the functional consequences of UPF1 catalytic inhibition and activation remain poorly understood . Moreover , recent work has indicated that UPF2 also reduces UPF1 affinity for RNA ( 29 ) . Therefore , we set out to systematically investigate the biochemical and functional effects of the structural rearrangement of UPF1 induced by UPF2 binding . To do so , we first kinetically probed how UPF1 interacts with nucleic acids in the closed and open states ( Figure 1A ) . To study the open state of UPF1 without confounding factors such as binding and dissociation of UPF2 , we generated mutants to disrupt the F192 - I757 intramolecular interaction that normally stabilizes the closed state via docking of the CH domain onto the RecA2 domain ( Figure 1A ) . We used the perpetually open F192E mutant ( 10 , 24 , 25 ) and a second mutant , I757R , predicted to disrupt this interaction ( Figure 1B ) . We introduced these mutants into a well - characterized UPF1 construct containing the CH and helicase domains ( UPF1 - CH - HD ; Supplementary Figure S1A , left ) . We first set out to quantitatively measure how the open state of UPF1 influences initial binding to nucleic acids utilizing the Octet Bio - Layer Interferometry ( BLI ) system . In this assay , binding of molecules to a streptavidin - coated sensor surface creates a wavelength shift proportional to the thickness of surface - bound molecules . We tethered a biotinylated DNA oligonucleotide substrate to the sensor , which resulted in a small thickness increase due to the small size of the oligonucleotide ( Figure 1C - D , steps 1 - 3 ; Supplementary Figure S1B - C , steps 1 - 3 ) . After addition of UPF1 - CH - HD , the signal dramatically increased in a dose - and oligo - dependent 10 manner ( Figure 1C - D , step 4 ; Supplementary Figure S1B - C , step 4 ) , indicating UPF1 - CH - HD was specifically binding the substrate rather than non - specifically sticking to the surface . With a robust pre - steady state binding assay , we compared WT to the perpetually open mutants F192E and I757R ( Figure 1B ) and found the rates of F192E and I757R association with the substrate were significantly slower compared to WT ( Figure 1C - E , step 4 ; Supplementary Figure S1D ; Figure 1F ) . This effect was not influenced by nucleotide binding , as UPF1 association to the substrate was unchanged in the presence of the non - hydrolyzable ATP analog , AMP - PNP ( Supplementary Figure S1E - F ) . We corroborated the slow nucleic acid binding kinetics of the constitutively open mutants by adapting an established fluorescence - based unwinding assay . In this assay , displacement of a fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide strand by UPF1 results in quenching by a complementary oligonucleotide ( Supplementary Figure S2A ) . With this assay , we first confirmed that a commonly used minimal UPF2 fragment ( UPF2 - S , containing the third MIF4G domain and UPF1 binding domain ; Supplementary Figure S1A , right ) enhanced UPF1 - CH - HD unwinding on various DNA and RNA substrates in a dose - dependent manner ( Supplementary Figure S2B - C ) but did not significantly affect UPF1 - CH - HD relative processivity ( Supplementary Figure S2D - E , Supplementary Materials & Methods ) . However , we observed drastically different unwinding kinetics when we varied the duration of incubation of UPF1 or UPF1 - UPF2 complexes with the unwinding assay substrate ( Supplementary Figure S2F ) . Unwinding activity increased markedly with increasing incubation time for UPF1 - CH - HD / UPF2 - S complexes but not UPF1 - CH - HD alone ( Supplementary Figure S2G - I ) , indicating that the complex may bind the substrate more slowly . To distinguish between effects caused by UPF2 binding and those caused by the open state of UPF1 , we mimicked the open state by using a UPF1 construct lacking the CH domain ( UPF1 - HD ; Supplementary Figure S1A , left ) . Like UPF1 - UPF2 complexes , UPF1 - HD showed enhanced sensitivity to incubation time for unwinding activity ( Supplementary Figure S2I ) , suggesting that slow nucleic acid binding kinetics are an intrinsic property of the open state of UPF1 . This result was further supported by fluorescence anisotropy equilibrium binding assays , in which we observed reduced nucleic acid binding affinity of F192E compared to WT UPF1 - CH - HD in both the presence and absence of ATP ( Supplementary Figure S2J ) . UPF2 enhances UPF1 ATP - stimulated dissociation from nucleic acids by promoting the open state . The open state induced by UPF2 appears to delay initial UPF1 binding to nucleic 11 acids ( Figure 1F ) but also enhances UPF1 enzymatic activity on nucleic acids ( Supplementary Figure S2B - C ) ( 21 , 24 ) . We next investigated how UPF2 affects UPF1 dissociation from nucleic acids , since UPF1 dissociation from RNA is thought to be an important determinant of NMD efficiency and specificity ( 5 , 30 – 32 , 35 , 42 ) . Using BLI , we incubated the sensors containing UPF1 - bound DNA in buffer ( Figure 1C , step 5 ) , which caused negligible ATP - independent dissociation of UPF1 ( Figure 1D - E , step 5 ) . When we moved the complex into a solution with saturating ATP and trap strand to capture any dissociated UPF1 molecules ( Figure 1C , step 6 ) , we observed rapid ATP - stimulated dissociation ( Figure 1D , step 6 ) , which was significantly faster with the open F192E and I757R mutants ( Figure 1E , step 6 ; Figure 1G ) . To corroborate the finding that constitutively open mutants undergo accelerated ATP - stimulated dissociation , we used a previously developed fluorescence anisotropy - based dissociation ( FAD ) assay . In this assay , fluorescence polarization decreases over time as UPF1 molecules dissociate from the fluorescent substrate and are captured by the excess trap strand in solution ( Figure 2A ) ( 31 ) . With this assay , we found that UPF1 - CH - HD underwent efficient ATP - stimulated dissociation from the substrate ( Figure 2B , orange curve ) , and UPF2 - S enhanced this dissociation ( Figure 2B , red curve ) . We also performed control experiments to verify that UPF2 - S did not detectably bind the fluorescent substrate under these assay conditions ( Supplementary Figure S3A ) . Additionally , we observed high rates of UPF2 - independent ATP - stimulated dissociation of I757R and F192E ( Figure 2C - D ) . These findings were recapitulated with structured substrates ( Supplementary Figure S3B ) and at a higher pH ( Supplementary Figure S3C ) . The higher rates of ATP - stimulated dissociation of F192E and I757R in the absence of UPF2 - S ( Figure 2D ) suggest that UPF2 primarily promotes UPF1 dissociation from nucleic acids by stimulating ATP hydrolysis ( 5 , 18 , 24 , 39 – 41 ) . We therefore predicted that slowing the ATP hydrolysis rates of the F192E and I757R proteins would correspondingly slow their dissociation . To test this hypothesis , we combined F192E or I757R with a mutation that decreases UPF1 ATPase rate , E797R ( 31 ) . As predicted , the compound F192E / E797R ( FE - ER ) and I757R / E797R ( IR - ER ) mutants both underwent slower ATP - stimulated dissociation than the F192E and I757R mutants alone , with rates similar to WT in FAD ( Figure 2D ) and BLI assays ( Figure 2E ) . The addition of the E797R mutation to the F192E and I757R mutant backgrounds did not alter nucleic acid on - rates ( Figure 2F ) . 12 In silico modeling predicts cellular UPF1 - RNA interactions are dominated by intrinsic kinetic properties of UPF1 rather than UPF2 - induced kinetic properties . UPF2 has the potential to both positively and negatively regulate UPF1 function in NMD by slowing down initial RNA binding , enhancing unwinding / translocation , and / or enhancing ATP - stimulated dissociation from RNA . However , these effects are likely constrained by the relative abundances of UPF1 and UPF2 in human cells , as proteomic studies estimate that UPF1 is approximately 10 - fold more abundant than UPF2 in HEK - 293T cells ( ~ 450 , 000 versus ~ 54 , 000 molecules per cell ) ( 43 , 44 ) . To better understand the relative contributions of UPF2 to UPF1 occupancy on mRNAs in cells , we used our experimentally determined kinetic parameters of UPF1 - RNA ( Figure 1F - G ; Figure 2D - F ) and UPF1 - UPF2 interactions ( Supplementary Figure S4A - D ) to simulate interactions among equimolar amounts of RNA and UPF1 and differing quantities of UPF2 ( Figure 3A , Supplementary Table S4 ) . Computational modeling predicted that UPF2 can only suppress the fraction of UPF1 bound to RNA at high UPF2 : UPF1 stoichiometries ( Figure 3B ) . Correspondingly , a large majority of UPF1 association ( Figure 3C ) and dissociation ( Figure 3D ) events are predicted to occur independent of UPF2 at the physiological UPF2 : UPF1 : mRNA stoichiometry of 1 : 10 : 10 ( Figure 3C - D , 0 . 1 column ) . Taken together , intrinsic UPF1 properties are likely to be largely responsible for cellular RNA interactions , with minimal effects from UPF2 due to its lower relative abundance to UPF1 . Our finding of efficient ATPase - stimulated release of UPF1 from nucleic acid in the absence of UPF2 ( Figure 1D ; Figure 2B ) raised the question of whether this requires spontaneous undocking of the CH domain into the open state . Alternatively , UPF1 ATP hydrolysis and RNA release could occur at slower rates in the closed state compared to the open state . To gain insight into this question , we combined multiple turnover unwinding assays on different structured substrates ( Supplementary Figure S5A - C ) with computational kinetic modeling . We observed that UPF1 unwound short hairpin DNA ( hpDNA ) substrates with biphasic kinetics in multiple - and single - turnover conditions ( Supplementary Figure S5B , D , E ) . We did not observe these biphasic kinetics with the open F192E mutant ( Supplementary Figure S5F ) or UPF1 - HD ( 31 ) . Computational modeling ( Supplementary Materials & Methods ) predicted that this kinetic profile is consistent with UPF1 unwinding 0 . 75 bp / sec in the open state and 0 . 025 - 0 . 1 bp / sec in the closed state , with a 0 . 005 - 0 . 1 probability of opening per step and a 0 . 0 - 0 . 5 probability of closing per step ( Supplementary Figure S5G , panels boxed in red indicating at least one simulated curve matches the experimental data ) . This indicates that not only can 13 UPF1 unwind without UPF2 , but also has the ability to stochastically switch between the open and closed states , with activity in both states . Identification of more strongly autoinhibited UPF1 mutants . Based on the predicted central importance of intrinsic UPF1 properties in determining UPF1 - RNA interaction dynamics ( Figure 3 ) , we pursued a strategy of identifying and / or characterizing UPF1 mutants with alterations in autoinhibition , ATP hydrolysis , and ATP - stimulated dissociation . This work was bolstered by our unexpected identification of a UPF1 residue located at the 3′ end of the RNA binding channel , G619 ( Figure 4A ) , that can be mutated to generate proteins that are more strongly autoinhibited and are thus more reliant on UPF2 for enzymatic activation . In the course of characterizing hits from two parallel in silico screens ( Supplementary Figure S6A - C ; Supplementary Table S5 - 6 ) ( 31 ) to identify UPF1 mutants with differential RNA binding properties in the open and closed states , we found that mutation of G619 to histidine , phenylalanine , or tyrosine resulted in stronger autoinhibition of UPF1 . In the presence of UPF2 - S , the G619H , G619F , and G619Y mutants exhibited unwinding activity comparable to WT UPF1 - CH - HD on DNA ( Figure 4B - C , Supplementary Figure S7A - B , red curves ; Figure 4D , red bars ) and RNA ( Figure 4E - F , Supplementary Figure S7C - D , red curves ; Figure 4G , red bars ) , but without UPF2 - S , they showed significantly lower unwinding activity compared to WT in the absence of UPF2 - S ( Figure 4B - G , Supplementary Figure S7A - D , orange curves / bars ) . G619H , G619F , and G619Y mutants had minimal dissociation defects on DNA substrates with a 3′ overhang compared to WT ( Supplementary Figure S8A - E ) but exhibited modestly slower ATP - stimulated dissociation from substrates containing a double - stranded region ( Figure 4H - I , Supplementary Figure S7E - F , compare orange curves to blue curves ; Figure 4J , orange bars ) . This defect was overcome when UPF2 - S was present ( Figure 4H - I , Supplementary Figure S7E - F , compare red curves to green curves ; Figure 4J , red bars ) . These mutants did not exhibit nucleic acid binding defects , as measured by fluorescence anisotropy ( Supplementary Figure S8F - I ) or increased Alexa Fluor 647 - labeled UPF2 - S binding , as measured by microscale thermophoresis ( MST , Supplementary Figure S8J ) . Together , these findings suggest that the G619H , G619F , and G619Y mutants are more autoinhibited but that UPF2 binding is sufficient to overcome this enhanced autoinhibition . Based on the positioning of residue 619 at the 3′ end of the RNA binding channel ( Figure 4A ) , we speculated that enhanced autoinhibition may involve base stacking interactions between the 14 nucleic acid substrate and the aromatic residue at position 619 . In support of this , mutation to non - aromatic residues ( i . e . G619K and G619C ) were not more autoinhibited than WT in either unwinding ( Supplementary Figure S9A - F ) or dissociation assays ( Supplementary Figure S9G - J ) . In fact , G619K had slightly higher unwinding activity ( Supplementary Figure S9A - C ) as previously reported for G619K in the UPF1 - HD construct ( 31 ) . Furthermore , mutating G619 did not appear to influence nucleic acid on - rate , as G619K and G619H both exhibited WT - like on - rates ( Supplementary Figure S9K - L ) . Only G619K modestly enhanced ATP - dependent off - rates on single - stranded substrates in BLI experiments ( Supplementary Figure S9M ) . More strongly autoinhibited UPF1 mutants support regulation of canonical NMD targets . To test the effects of UPF1 autoinhibition and ATPase activation on cellular NMD , we assembled a panel of new and previously characterized UPF1 mutants with alterations in various aspects of catalytic activation and ATP - stimulated dissociation . The panel comprises UPF1 mutants with 1 ) impaired ATP - stimulated dissociation ( ATPase - deficient mutants K498A ( 19 , 45 ) , DE636AA ( 20 , 46 ) , and R843C ( 47 , 48 ) ; mechanically impaired A546H ( 31 , 49 ) ) , 2 ) impaired mechanical properties but restored ATP - stimulated dissociation ( G619K / A546H [ GA - KH ] ( 31 ) ) , 3 ) increased autoinhibition ( G619H , G619F , G619Y ) , 4 ) decreased autoinhibition with slower nucleic acid on - rates and accelerated ATP - stimulated dissociation ( F192E , I757R ) , and 5 ) decreased autoinhibition with slower nucleic acid on - rates but WT - like rates of ATP - stimulated dissociation ( FE - ER and IR - ER ) ( Figure 5A ) . To evaluate cellular NMD functionality , we generated cell lines stably expressing N - terminal CLIP - tagged versions of these UPF1 mutants at levels comparable to endogenous UPF1 ( 31 ) and performed knockdown / rescue experiments followed by RT - qPCR or RNA - seq ( Figure 5B ) . Knockdown of endogenous UPF1 caused up - regulation of several well - characterized NMD target mRNAs ( e . g . containing a premature termination codon [ PTC ] or long 3′ UTR ) , an effect completely counteracted by expression of WT CLIP - UPF1 but not the CLIP tag alone ( Figure 5C ) . Despite having a distinctly greater dependence on UPF2 for enzymatic activation in vitro , the more strongly autoinhibited G619H , G619F , and G619Y mutants fully rescued the effects of endogenous UPF1 knockdown ( Figure 5C ) . Because these mutants were indistinguishable from WT UPF1 or the control G619K mutant in knockdown / rescue experiments , we chose to focus further tests of the butterfly model on UPF1 mutants with altered ATP - dependent dissociation from RNA . 15 UPF1 mutants with impaired ATP - stimulated dissociation exhibit cellular NMD defects . In RNA - seq of knockdown / rescue experiments , we confirmed that UPF1 mutants with RNA dissociation defects did not restore NMD as well as WT UPF1 . We evaluated UPF1 activity in two ways . First , we monitored overall changes in RNA abundance by gene - level differential expression analyses ( Figure 5D and Supplementary Figure S10A - C ) . Second , we investigated isoform - specific effects of UPF1 knockdown and rescue by performing splice junction - level analyses of differential transcript isoform usage ( Supplementary Figure S10D - E ) . This approach focuses on reads arising from cassette exon splicing events and thus enriches for transcriptome alterations linked to PTCs . NMD - deficient mutants in this class consist of A546H , which is defective for ATP - stimulated dissociation from structured substrates ( 31 ) , and extensively characterized ATPase - deficient mutants K498A , DE636AA , and R843C . In contrast , E797R , which hydrolyzes ATP slowly , and the GA - KH compound mutant that exhibits A546H - like mechanical deficiencies but restored ATP - stimulated dissociation relative to A546H , promoted NMD , with similar efficiency as WT CLIP - UPF1 ( Figure 5D , Supplementary Figure S10A - E ) . Together these results support the idea that cellular NMD relies on proper ATP - stimulated dissociation of UPF1 . Constitutively open UPF1 mutant F192E impairs UPF2 association and phosphorylation . We next set out to determine the functional consequences of constitutive relief of UPF1 autoinhibition . As part of our initial cellular characterization of UPF1 mutants , we assayed interactions between selected representatives of the UPF1 mutant classes and UPF2 by immunoprecipitation of endogenous UPF2 . Along with selected mutants from above , we included two additional UPF1 mutants as positive controls , VV204 - 5DI ( VVDI ) and LECY181 - 4VRVD ( LECY ) , previously found to have moderate and severe reductions in UPF2 binding , respectively ( 13 ) . Neither VVDI nor LECY exhibited UPF2 binding within the detection limit of this assay ( Supplementary Figure S11A ) , and both correspondingly showed a drastic reduction in steady - state phosphorylation ( Supplementary Figure S11B - C ) . I757R , IR - ER , E797R , and G619H retained full association with UPF2 , but F192E and FE - ER exhibited reduced co - immunoprecipitation with UPF2 ( Supplementary Figure S11A , E ) , consistent with evidence of direct binding of F192 by UPF2 ( 25 ) . F192E and FE - ER were correspondingly phosphorylated at significantly lower levels , likely due to their reduced association with UPF2 ( Supplementary Figure S11F - G ) . 16 Constitutively open UPF1 mutants are partially defective for cellular NMD . In the RNA - seq of knockdown / rescue experiments , I757R restored NMD to a greater extent than F192E , as determined by gene - level differential expression analyses ( Figure 6A - B ) and splice junction - level analyses of NMD - sensitive transcript isoforms ( Figure 6C ) . Lower NMD activity of F192E is consistent with our observation of impaired F192E UPF2 association and phosphorylation ( Supplementary Figure S11A - G ) . F192E was less active than the WT and E797R positive controls on well - established NMD targets but more active than LECY ( Supplementary Figure S11H ) , suggesting that F192E retains some ability to recruit UPF2 ( Figure 6A - C , Supplementary Figure S11H ) . This is consistent with impaired UPF2 binding and phosphorylation of VVDI ( Supplementary Figure S11A - C ) , yet moderate restoration of NMD ( Supplementary Figure S11H ) . The compound FE - ER mutant more efficiently restored NMD transcriptome - wide relative to F192E , such that it attained similar activity to I757R ( Figure 6A - C ) . Addition of the E797R mutation in the I757R background ( i . e . IR - ER ) yielded no further increase in NMD rescue compared to I757R ( Figure 6A - C ) , indicating that the constitutively activated mutants have defects that cannot be overcome by slowing the rate of ATP hydrolysis . Together , our data suggest that constitutive undocking of the CH domain has multiple impacts on UPF1 biochemical activities but can be partially alleviated by reducing the rate of ATP - stimulated dissociation to WT - like levels . Discussion The fact that autoinhibition of UPF1 catalytic activity is conserved throughout eukaryotes implies that it plays an important role in cellular NMD ( 24 ) . However , the mechanisms by which UPF1 autoinhibition and activation by UPF2 promote mRNA decay are poorly understood . To address this gap , we used a combination of biochemical / biophysical , computational , and sequencing - based methods to identify and characterize UPF1 mutants . We find that the open state of UPF1 has slower association kinetics and faster ATP - stimulated dissociation kinetics to and from nucleic acids , respectively ( Figures 1 , 2 and 6D ) . Computational modeling based on kinetic measurements suggest that the low cellular abundance of UPF2 limits its impact on UPF1 - RNA interactions . At cellular UPF2 : UPF1 : mRNA stoichiometries , modeling predicts that the majority of UPF1 - RNA binding and dissociation events occur in the absence of UPF2 ( Figure 3 ) . Nonetheless , we find that newly identified UPF1 mutants that are more strongly inhibited in the absence of UPF2 ( Figure 4 ) are able to support decay of canonical NMD target mRNAs ( Figure 5 ) . In contrast , UPF1 mutants that are unable to undergo efficient ATP - stimulated dissociation or are perpetually in the open state have reduced NMD activity in human cells ( Figures 5 and 17 6 ) . These findings are consistent with the recently proposed butterfly model of NMD , in which an important function of UPF1 ATPase activity is autoregulation of RNA binding ( 31 ) . Importantly , UPF1 does not require UPF2 for ATP hydrolysis or ATP - stimulated dissociation . Instead , UPF2 accelerates the rates of both processes ( Figure 2 and Figure 6D ) ( 5 , 18 , 24 , 39 – 41 ) . This implies that UPF1 sampling of the transcriptome through successive rounds of binding and dissociation need not require activation by UPF2 . In line with this , modeling of interactions among UPF1 , UPF2 , and RNA that takes into account experimentally derived kinetic parameters and cellular abundance of these components predicts that a large fraction of UPF1 - RNA association and dissociation events are UPF2 - independent ( Figure 3 ) . Further , we leverage the kinetic measurements of in vitro hairpin unwinding experiments to perform modeling that indicates UPF1 catalytic activity can occur in both the open and closed states ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . These results blur the line between the previously proposed RNA - clamping versus RNA - unwinding modes of the closed versus open states , respectively ( 24 ) . More in - depth experiments to directly interrogate the relationship between CH domain undocking and enzymatic activity will be required to further elucidate opening and closing dynamics . While our experimental data and computational modeling suggest that most cellular UPF1 - RNA association and dissociation events are UPF2 - independent , the inhibitory effects of UPF2 binding on UPF1 may still be important in multiple ways . For instance , slow UPF1 - UPF2 association with RNA may help to impose an order of assembly such that UPF1 binding to potential substrates is followed by UPF2 binding . This mechanism may help prevent promiscuous RNA decay , as it disfavors initial binding between mRNAs and the pro - decay UPF1 - UPF2 complex . This mechanism could also enforce preferential decay of mRNAs harboring one or more exon junction complexes ( EJCs ) , as UPF2 recruitment to EJCs would in turn drive UPF1 - UPF2 interactions , UPF1 phosphorylation , and decay . A second mechanism by which UPF2 may help enforce decay specificity is by stimulating dissociation of UPF1 . UPF2 association with UPF1 bound in a context that does not meet additional requirements for decay may help to recycle UPF1 off RNAs more quickly . In this scenario , UPF2 would serve a proofreading role to prevent inappropriate decay by decreasing the kinetic window for decay initiation . 18 The data presented here also reinforce previous findings that UPF1 mutants with impaired ability to perform work in the form of unwinding and protein displacement can be fully competent for NMD ( 31 ) . The GA - KH double mutant unwinds slowly ( ~ 0 . 25 bp / sec ) with poor processivity ( ~ 10 - 20 bp per binding event ) and is mechanochemically uncoupled ( 31 ) , yet almost precisely phenocopies wild - type UPF1 transcriptome - wide in knockdown / rescue experiments ( Figure 5 ) . Likewise , the E797R mutation slows the rates of ATP hydrolysis and translocation ( ~ 0 . 2 bp / sec ) but permits equal or modestly greater NMD rescue following endogenous UPF1 knockdown ( Figures 5 and 6 ) . These findings are compatible with ATP - dependent roles for UPF1 in local RNP remodeling or ribosome recycling ( 22 , 23 ) , but do strongly argue against models in which UPF1 acts as a processive RNP remodeler to promote RNA degradation . Further , the substantial activity of constitutively active mutants in cells ( Figure 6 ) , suggest that specific activation of UPF1 enzymatic activity in response to UPF2 binding or other triggers is largely dispensable for NMD . The partial improvement in NMD activity of the FE - ER double - mutant relative to the F192E mutant alone is consistent with the hypothesis that one function of UPF1 autoinhibition is to slow the rate of ATP - stimulated dissociation . However , we did not see a similar effect for the IR - ER double - mutant versus I757R ( Figure 6 ) . Given the multifaceted roles of UPF1 in NMD , it is likely that constitutively open UPF1 mutants have impaired activity for multiple reasons , some of which can be ameliorated by depressing overall ATPase activity and some of which cannot . Interestingly , both I757R and IR - ER both showed similar NMD efficiencies as FE - ER , suggesting that WT levels of UPF2 binding and phosphorylation may insulate them from other defects . We identified four relevant properties of F192E that may contribute to decreased activity in NMD : slower nucleic acid on - rate , faster nucleic acid ATP - stimulated off - rate , reduced UPF2 association , and reduced phosphorylation . I757R and IR - ER were stably associated with UPF2 in co - immunoprecipitation experiments and were phosphorylated at levels comparable to WT UPF1 . Like F192E and FE - ER , the on - rates of I757R and IR - ER were reduced , and we cannot exclude the possibility that other aspects of the mutant proteins’ interactions , folding , or enzymatic activities are perturbed . Future investigation will be required to dissect the functional contributions of the closed and open states of UPF1 to NMD . An open question not addressed in our work is whether UPF1 dissociation from RNAs is inhibited at a particular stage of NMD , either before or after the commitment to decay . One possibility is that UPF1 phosphorylation and / or translation termination directly affect UPF1 19 dissociation rates by modulating ATP hydrolysis ( 5 , 11 ) . Alternatively , higher - order complex assembly initiated by SMG5 , SMG6 , and / or SMG7 binding to phosphorylated UPF1 may establish multivalent interactions capable of holding UPF1 in proximity to RNA despite the disruptive effect of ATP hydrolysis on UPF1 - RNA interactions ( 14 , 15 ) . In addition , RNA - binding proteins such as staufen and the histone stem - loop binding protein may tether UPF1 to RNA , preventing its dissociation ( 50 , 51 ) . Similarly , the mammalian “long - loop” alternative isoform of UPF1 is less susceptible to ATPase - stimulated dissociation , allowing it to function on RNAs normally immune to decay ( 34 ) . 20 Supplementary Data Supplementary Material consists of Supplementary Materials & Methods , 11 Supplementary Figures , and 8 Supplementary Tables .
