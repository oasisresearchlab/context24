These beads were then immersed in [ 1 ] , and this arrangement is considered to be optimal cell extracts containing endogenous Arp2 / 3 complex at for motility .

Strikingly , alignment disappeared mesoscopic analysis ofmovement provides a possible when the beads were coated exclusively with VCA ( 0 % explanation for our results . mole PRO , Figure 1A ) , andbeads coated with 2 . 1 % mole PRO ( Figure 1B ) displayed an intermediate situation . In Results and Discussion the three cases , quantification of visible filament lengths and angles confirmed these observations ( Figures 1D We addressed the question of how the organization of and 1E ) . The length distribution found for the beads actin filaments in comet tails is affected by the presence most enriched in PRO was shifted upward as compared of bead velocity enhancers in order to identify what to the lower concentrations , with 70 % of the filaments actin arrangement is associated with optimized move - having observable lengths greater than 50 nm .

( D ) and ( E ) show the distributions of observable filament lengths and angles , respectively , for 0 % , 2 . 1 % , and 7 . 6 % mole PRO beads . For each condition , platinum replica electron micrographs of 5 – 6 beads are analyzed . Filaments are examined with Metamorph software in a 500 nm by 500 nm area , 250 nm from the surface of the bead . Filaments are traced from a branch point or from the point where they emerge from the network to the end of the filament or to the point where the filament disappears into the network . Filaments that extend beyond the 500 (cid:4) 500 nm square are not counted . The angles refer to the orientation of the filaments relative to the direction of movement of the bead , and the absolute values are used , i . e . , deviations to one or the other side of the normal to the surface of the bead are both taken as positive . For curved tails , thefilamentangleisnormalizedtothedirectionofthemovementattheplacewheretheanalysisisperformed . Thefilamentcountisrepresented as a percent of the total number of filaments counted ( 0 % mole PRO : 327 filaments from 5 comets ; 2 . 1 % mole PRO : 616 filaments from 5 comets ; 7 . 6 % mole PRO : 374 filaments from 6 comets ) . Average values for lengths and the most probable angle values are represented on each graph . ( F ) Filament alignment is evident throughout the length of the comet for a 10 . 3 % mole PRO comet .

Bead velocity enhancement by VASP has previously been observed [ 2 ] , although this is the first time that such a large increase ( 7 - fold ) has been documented . Strikingly , larger 4 . 5 (cid:2) m diameter beads displayed approximately the same speed as small beads ( (cid:4) sym - bols and filled circles in Figure 2 ) . The fact that small and large beads move at the same speed indicates that we cannot describe our results in terms of a tethered ratchet model , which predicts faster movement with larger beads [ 14 ] . Movement of beads as large as 4 . 5 (cid:2) m in diameter has previously been observed only in the mix - ture of purified proteins , but the movement is saltatory and corresponds to lower average speeds [ 15 ] . In cell extracts , large beads generally form a spherical actin gel that rarely undergoes symmetry breaking [ 16 , 17 ] . Thecometstructureobservedbyelectronmicroscopy of platinum replica reveals the filament organization on the outer surface of the comet only . We used the 4 . 5 Figure 2 .

Sym - ness decreased with decreasing quantities of PRO ( Fig - metrical 0 . 5 (cid:2) m diameter beads are less efficient in generating ure 3 ) . Although occasionally displaying a very small comets , and only 10 % of beads coated with PRO / VCA mixes form tunnel in the center of the comet ( Figure 3A , panel 1 ) , comets .

There was also very little Arp2 / 3 complex present in the tails of rapidly moving beads ( Figure S4 ) , which agrees with the electron microscopy plasma membrane [ 12 ] . Conversely , the branched struc - observation that there was little branching in these ture observed for VCA beads is similar to that present comets . The presence of aligned filaments in the comets in the lamellipodia [ 7 ] . Indeed , the most probable angle could indicate a reorganization produced by actin for filaments associated with VCA - coated beads was filament - bundling proteins , like fascin and fimbrin . Al - about 30 (cid:3) , which is as expected from the presence of though both were present in extracts at 2 (cid:2) M as mea - a 70 (cid:3) - branching angle produced by the Arp2 / 3 complex , sured by quantitative Western blotting ( see Experimen - which straddles the direction of movement [ 7 , 13 ] . tal Procedures ) , fascin was not detectably recruited to When coated exclusively with VCA , 0 . 5 (cid:2) m diameter eitherVCAorVCA / PROcomets .

In fact , more fimbrin an average speed of 1 . 5 (cid:1) 0 . 3 (cid:2) m / min ( open circles in was associated with comets on VCA - coated beads , as Figure 2 ) . This velocity was increased dramatically to a expected from the increased amount of actin present . value of about 10 (cid:2) m / min for 3 % – 19 % mole PRO . As a All together , our results raise two main questions : specific example , the velocity of a 7 . 6 % mole PRO bead , how does the recruitment of VASP to the bead surface displaying an aligned structure when viewed by electron enhance speed by producing hollow comets , and why microscopy ( Figure 1C ) , was 10 . 0 (cid:1) 1 . 0 (cid:2) m / min . For the is this arrangement associated with aligned filaments intermediate concentration of 2 . 1 % mole PRO , which apparently independent of actin - filament bundlers ?

The velocity dia - recruitment to the bead surface ( Figure S3 ) , and we also gram in Figure 2 displays a biphasic profile : a low - speed verified that when PRO wasreplaced with the C - terminal regime either in the absence of PRO or with small domain of ActA ( ActA - C ) , which is identical to PRO but amounts of PRO ( i . e . , VASP ) and a high speed regime appearing at a certain threshold amount of VASP , inde - lacks the VASP binding site , there was no velocity en - Rapid Propulsion with Hollow Comets 1769 Figure 3 .

Linescan measurements are performed on confocal sections that pass through the center of the comet ( i . e . , at largest width ) , two - bead diameters from the bead surface . The line is drawn perpendicular to the comet length , and variation in fluorescence intensity along the line ( in arbitrary units ) is plotted as a function of distance with the comets all centered at 0 for clarity . Slight hollowness is observed occasionally for 2 . 1 % mole PRO ( A , panel 1 ) , although most comets are homogenous ( A , panel 2 and graph ) . 12 . 5 % mole PRO consistently displays a broad swath of diminished intensity at the center of the comet ( B , panels 3 and 4 and graph ) . The comets on beads coated only with VCA are too short ( less than a bead diameter ) to be analyzed by this technique . The scale bars represent 2 (cid:2) m . pendent of bead size . The 2 . 1 % mole PRO point is at weaker than pulling forces , and the rupture would result in an abrupt acceleration in bead speed because attach - the transition point and is characterized by an elevated relative error , as both low and high speeds are often ment at the rear of the bead would disappear . The fact that the filaments then align is reminiscent of a transition observed for this point . If VASP were simply affecting barbed - end polymerization dynamics either directly or to a nematic phase for an isotropic liquid crystal in the vicinity of a surface [ 18 , 19 ] because in a hollow comet , by increasing the local concentration of G - actin , we would expect a linear dependence of speed on percent most of the filaments are confined close to a cylinder surface . New filaments are still produced at the bead mole PRO .

For 4 . 5 (cid:2) m beads , 0 . 4 (cid:2) l of 1 . 6 % – 1 . 8 % bead suspension was mixed with 8 (cid:2) l of extract and treated as above . Beads were observed by phase - contrast microscopy .
