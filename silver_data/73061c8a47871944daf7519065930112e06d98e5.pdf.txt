Here we present the first extensive map of human DHSs identified through genome - wide profiling in 125 diverse cell and tissue types . We identify ~ 2 . 9 million DHSs that encompass virtually all known experimentally - validated cis - regulatory sequences and expose a vast trove of novel elements , most with highly cell - selective regulation . Annotating these elements using ENCODE data reveals novel relationships between chromatin accessibility , transcription , DNA methylation , and regulatory factor occupancy patterns . We connect ~ 580 , 000 distal DHSs with their target promoters , revealing systematic pairing of different classes of distal DHSs and specific promoter types . Patterning of chromatin accessibility at many regulatory regions is choreographed with dozens to hundreds of co - activated elements , and the trans - cellular DNaseI sensitivity pattern at a given region can predict cell type - specific functional behaviors . The DHS landscape shows signatures of recent functional evolutionary constraint . However , the DHS compartment in pluripotent and immortalized cells exhibits higher mutation rates than that in highly differentiated cells , exposing an unexpected link between chromatin accessibility , proliferative potential and patterns of human variation . INTRODUCTION Cell - selective activation of regulatory DNA drives the gene expression patterns that shape cell identity . Regulatory DNA is characterized by the cooperative binding of sequence - specific transcriptional regulatory factors in place of a canonical nucleosome , leading to a remodeled chromatin state characterized by markedly heightened accessibility to nucleases 1 . DNaseI hypersensitive sites ( DHSs ) in chromatin were first identified over 30 years ago , and have since been extensively leveraged to map regulatory DNA regions in diverse organisms 2 . DNaseI hypersensitivity is the sine qua non of all defined classes of active cis - regulatory elements including enhancers , promoters , silencers , insulators , and locus control regions 2 - 4 . Because DNaseI hypersensitivity overlies cis - regulatory elements directly and is maximal over the core region of regulatory factor occupancy , it enables precise delineation of the genomic cis - regulatory compartment . DHSs are flanked by nucleosomes , which may acquire histone modification patterns that reflect the functional role of the adjoining regulatory DNA , such as the association of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation ( H3K4me3 ) with promoter elements 5 . Recent advances have enabled genome - scale mapping of DHSs in mammalian cells 6 , 7 , laying the foundations for comprehensive catalogues of human regulatory DNA . General features of the accessible chromatin landscape Two ENCODE production centers ( University of Washington and Duke University ) profiled DNaseI sensitivity genome - wide using massively parallel sequencing 7 - 9 in a total of 125 human cell and tissue types including normal differentiated primary cells ( n = 71 ) , immortalized primary cells ( n = 16 ) , malignancy - derived cell lines ( n = 30 ) and multipotent and pluripotent progenitor cells ( n = 8 ) ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . The density of mapped DNaseI cleavages as a function of genome position provides a continuous quantitative measure of chromatin accessibility , in which DNaseI hypersensitive sites ( DHSs ) appear as prominent peaks within the signal data from each cell type ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Figs . 1 , 2 ) . Analysis using a common algorithm ( see Methods ) identified 2 , 890 , 742 distinct high - Thurman et al . Page 2 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 July 24 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t confidence DHSs ( false discovery rate of 1 % ; see Methods ) , each of which was active in one or more cell types . Of these DHSs , 970 , 100 were specific to a single cell type , 1 , 920 , 642 were active in 2 or more cell types , and a small minority ( 3 , 692 ) was detected in all cell types . The relative accessibility of DHSs along the genome varies by > 100 - fold and is highly consistent across cell types ( Supplementary Figs . 1 , 2 ) . To estimate the sensitivity and accuracy of the sequencing - derived DHS maps , one ENCODE production center ( UW ) performed 7 , 478 classical DNaseI hypersensitivity experiments by the Southern hybridization method 2 . Using Southerns as the standard , the average sensitivity , per cell type , of DNaseI - seq ( at a sequencing depth of 30M uniquely mapping reads ) was 81 . 6 % , with specificity of 99 . 5 - 99 . 9 % . Of DHSs classified as false negatives within a particular cell type , an average of 92 . 4 % were detected as a DHS in another cell type or upon deeper sequencing . As such , we estimate that the overall sensitivity for DHSs of the combined cell type maps is > 98 % . Approximately 3 % ( n = 75 , 575 ) of DHSs localize to transcriptional start sites ( TSSs ) defined by Gencode 10 and 5 % ( n = 135 , 735 , including the aforementioned ) lie within 2 . 5 kb of a TSS . The remaining 95 % of DHSs are positioned more distally , and are roughly evenly divided between intronic and intergenic regions ( Fig . 1b ) . Promoters typically exhibit high accessibility across cell types , with the average promoter DHS detected in 29 cell types ( Fig 1c , second column ) . By contrast , distal DHSs are largely cell selective ( Fig . 1c , third column ) . MicroRNAs comprise a major class of regulatory molecules and have been extensively studied , resulting in consensus annotation of hundreds of conserved microRNA genes 11 , approximately one third of which are organized in polycistronic clusters 12 . However , most predicted promoters driving microRNA expression lack experimental evidence . Of 329 unique annotated miRNA TSSs ( Supplementary Methods ) , 300 ( 91 % ) either coincided with or closely approximated ( < 500 bp ) a DHS . Chromatin accessibility at microRNA promoters was highly promiscuous compared with Gencode TSSs ( Fig . 1c , fourth column ) , and showed cell lineage organization , paralleling the known regulatory roles of well - annotated lineage - specific microRNAs ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . The 20 - 50 bp read lengths from DNaseI - seq experiments enabled unique mapping to 86 . 9 % of the genomic sequence , allowing us to interrogate a large fraction of transposon sequences . A surprising number contain highly regulated DHSs ( Fig . 1c , fifth column and Supplementary Figs . 4 , 5 ) , compatible with cell - specific transcription of repetitive elements detected using ENCODE RNA sequencing data 13 . DHSs were most strongly enriched at LTR elements , which encode retroviral enhancer structures ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Two such examples are shown in Supplementary Fig . 4 , which also illustrates the strong cell - selectivity of chromatin accessibility seen for each major repeat class . We also documented numerous examples of transposeon DHSs that displayed enhancer activity in transient transfection assays ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Comparison with an extensive compilation of 1 , 046 experimentally validated distal , non - promoter cis - regulatory elements ( enhancers , insulators , locus control regions , etc . ) revealed the overwhelming majority ( 97 . 4 % ) to be encompassed within DNaseI hypersensitive chromatin ( Supplementary Table 4 ) , typically with strong cell selectivity ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . Transcription factor drivers of chromatin accessibility DNaseI hypersensitive sites result from cooperative binding of transcriptional factors in place of a canonical nucleosome 1 , 2 . To quantify the relationship between chromatin accessibility and the occupancy of regulatory factors , we compared sequencing depth - Thurman et al . Page 3 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 July 24 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t normalized DNaseI sensitivity in the ENCODE common cell line K562 to normalized ChIP - seq signals from all 42 transcription factors mapped by ENCODE ChIP - seq 14 in this cell type ( Fig . 2 ) . Simple summation of the ChIP - seq signals strikingly parallels quantitative DNaseI sensitivity at individual DHSs ( Fig . 2a ) and across the genome ( R = 0 . 79 , Fig . 2b ) . For example , the beta glob in locus control region contains a major enhancer element at hypersensitive site 2 ( HS2 ) , which appears to be occupied by dozens of TFs ( Supplementary Fig . 6a ) . Such highly overlapping binding patterns have been interpreted to signify weak interactions with lower - affinity recognition sequences potentiated by an accessible DNA template 15 . However , HS2 is a compact element with a functional core spanning ~ 110bp that contains 5 - 8 sites of transcription factor - DNA interaction in vivo depending on the cell type 16 - 18 . The fact that the cumulative ChIP - seq signal closely parallels the degree of nuclease sensitivity at HS2 and elsewhere is thus most readily explained by interactions between DNA - bound factors and other interacting factors that collectively potentiate the accessible chromatin state ( Supplementary Fig . 6b ) . Given the relatively limited number of factors studied , it may seem surprising that such a close correlation should be evident . However , most of the factors selected for ENCODE ChIP - seq studies have well - described or even fundamental roles in transcriptional regulation , and many were identified originally based on their high affinity for DNA . Alternatively , as originally proposed by Weintraub 19 , a limited number of factors may be involved in establishment and maintenance of chromatin remodeling , while others may interact non - specifically with the remodeled state . We also found that the recognition sequences for a small number of factors were consistently linked with elevated chromatin accessibility across all classes of sites and all cell types ( Supplementary Fig . 6c ) , suggesting that regulators acting through these sequences are key drivers of the accessibility landscape . Overall , 94 . 4 % of a combined 1 , 108 , 081 ChIP - seq peaks from all ENCODE TFs fall within accessible chromatin ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Fig . 7a ) , with the median factor having 98 . 2 % of its binding sites localized therein . Notably , a small number of factors diverged from this paradigm , including known chromatin repressors , such as the KRAB - associated factors KAP1 , SETDB1 and ZNF274 20 , 21 ( Fig . 2c ) . We hypothesized that a proportion of the occupancy sites of these factors represented binding within compacted heterochromatin . To test this , we developed targeted mass spectrometry assays 22 for KAP1 and three factors localizing almost exclusively within accessible chromatin ( GATA1 , c - Jun , NRF1 ) , and quantified their abundance in biochemically - defined heterochromatin 23 vs . a total chromatin fraction ( Supplementary Fig . 7b ) . This analysis confirmed that factors such as KAP1 significantly occupy heterochromatin ( Supplementary Fig . 7c ) . An invariant directional chromatin signature at promoters The annotation of sites of transcription origination continues to be an active and fundamental endeavor 15 . In addition to direct evidence of TSSs provided by RNA transcripts , H3K4me3 modifications are closely linked with TSSs 24 . We therefore explored systematically the relationship between chromatin accessibility and H3K4me3 patterns at well - annotated promoters , its relationship to transcription origination , and its variability across ENCODE cell types . We performed ChIP - seq for H3K4me3 in 56 cell types using the same biological samples used for DNaseI data ( Supplementary Table 1 , column D ) . Plotting DNaseI cleavage density vs . ChIP - seq tag density around TSSs reveals highly stereotyped , asymmetrical patterning of these chromatin features with a precise relationship to the TSS ( Fig . 3a - b ) . This directional pattern is consistent with a rigidly positioned nucleosome immediately downstream from the promoter DHS , and is largely invariant across cell types ( Fig . 3b ; Supplementary Fig . 8 ) .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t To map novel promoters ( and their directionality ) not encompassed by the Gencode consensus annotations , we applied a pattern - matching approach to scan the genome across all 56 cell types ( Supplementary Methods ) . Using this approach we identified a total of 113 , 622 distinct putative promoters . Of these , 68 , 769 correspond to previously annotated TSSs , and 44 , 853 represent novel predictions ( vs Gencode v7 ) . Of the novel sites , 99 . 5 % are supported by evidence from spliced ESTs and / or Cap Analysis of Gene Expression ( CAGE ) tag clusters ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Fig . 9 ; P < 0 . 0001 ; see Supplementary Methods ) . We found novel sites in every configuration relative to existing annotations ( Fig . 3d - f and Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . For example , 29 , 203 putative promoters are contained in the body of annotated genes , of which 17 , 214 are oriented antisense to the annotated direction of transcription , and 2 , 794 lie immediately downstream of an annotated gene 3’ end , with 1 , 638 in antisense orientation . The results indicate that chromatin data can systematically inform RNA transcription analyses , and suggest the existence of a large pool of cell - selective transcriptional promoters , many of which lie in antisense orientations . Chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation patterns CpG methylation has been closely linked with gene regulation , based chiefly on its association with transcriptional silencing 25 . However , the relationship between DNA methylation and chromatin structure has not been clearly defined . We analyzed ENCODE reduced - representation bisulfite sequencing ( RRBS ) data , which provide quantitative methylation measurements for several million CpGs 26 . We focused on 243 , 037 CpGs falling within DHSs in 19 cell types for which both data types were available from the same sample . We observed two broad classes of sites : those with a strong inverse correlation across cell types between DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility ( Fig . 4a , Supplementary Fig . 11a ) , and those with variable chromatin accessibility but constitutive hypomethylation ( Fig . 4a , right ) . To quantify these trends globally , we performed a linear regression analysis between chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation at the 34 , 376 CpG - containing DHSs ( see Supplementary Methods ) . Of these sites , 6 , 987 ( 20 % ) showed a significant association ( 1 % FDR ) between methylation and accessibility ( Supplementary Fig . 11b ) . Increased methylation was almost uniformly negatively associated with chromatin accessibility ( > 97 % of cases ) . The magnitude of the association between methylation and accessibility was strong , with the latter on average 95 % lower in cell types with coinciding methylation vs . cell types lacking coinciding methylation ( Supplementary Fig . 11c ) . Fully 40 % of variable methylation was associated with a concomitant effect on accessibility . The role of DNA methylation in causation of gene silencing is presently unclear . Does methylation reduce chromatin accessibility by evicting transcription factors ? Or does DNA methylation passively ‘fill in’ the voids left by vacating TFs ? Transcription factor expression is closely linked with the occupancy of its binding sites 27 . If the former of the two above hypotheses is correct , methylation of individual binding site sequences should be independent of TF gene expression . If the latter , methylation at TF recognition sequences should be inversely correlated with TF abundance ( Fig . 4b ) . Comparing TF transcript levels to average methylation at cognate recognition sites within DHSs revealed significant negative correlations between TF expression and binding site methylation for the majority ( 70 % ) of TFs with a significant association ( P < 0 . 05 ) . Representative examples are shown in Fig . 4c and Supplementary Fig . 12a . These data argue strongly that methylation patterning paralleling cell - selective chromatin accessibility results from passive deposition following the vacation of TFs from regulatory DNA , generalizing other recent reports 28 Interestingly , a small number of factors showed positive correlations between expression and binding site methylation ( Supplementary Fig . 12b ) , including MYB and LUN1 .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t these TFs showed increased transcription and binding site methylation specifically within acute promyelocytic leukemia cells ( NB4 ) , and both interact with PML bodies 29 , 30 , a sub - nuclear structure disrupted in promyelocytic leukemia cells . The anomalous behavior of these two TFs with respect to chromatin structure and DNA methylation may thus be related to a specialized mechanism seen only in pathologically altered cells . A genome - wide map of distal DHS - to - promoter connectivity From examination of DNaseI profiles across many cell types we observed that many known cell - selective enhancers become DHSs synchronously with the appearance of hypersensitivity at the promoter of their target gene ( Supplementary Figure 13 ) . To generalize this , we analyzed the patterning of 1 , 454 , 901 distal ( > 2 . 5kb from TSS ) DHSs across 79 diverse cell types ( Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 6 ) , and correlated the cross - cell type DNaseI signal at each DHS position with that at all promoters within ±500kb ( Supplementary Fig . 14a ) . We identified a total of 578 , 905 DHSs that were highly correlated ( R > 0 . 7 ) with at least one promoter ( P < 10 - 100 ) , providing an extensive map of candidate enhancers controlling specific genes ( Supplementary Methods , Supplementary Table 7 ) . To validate the distal DHS / enhancer - promoter connections , we profiled chromatin interactions using the chromosome conformation capture carbon copy ( 5C ) technique 31 . For example , the phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) gene is expressed in hepatic cells , and an enhancer has been defined upstream of its TSS ( Fig . 5a ) . The correlation values for three DHSs within the gene body closely parallel the frequency of long - range chromatin interactions measured by 5C . The three interacting intronic DHSs cloned downstream of a reporter gene driven by the PAH promoter all showed increased expression ranging from 3 - to 10 - fold over a promoter - only control , confirming enhancer function . We next examined comprehensive promoter - vs - all 5C experiments performed over 1 % of the human genome 32 in K562 cells . DHS - promoter pairings were markedly enriched in the specific cognate chromatin interaction ( P < 10 - 13 , Supplementary Fig . 14b ) . We also examined K562 promoter - DHS interactions detected by Pol II ChIA - PET 24 , which quantify interactions between promoter - bound polymerase and distal sites . The ChIA - PET interactions were also markedly enriched for DHS - promoter pairings ( P < 10 - 15 , Supplementary Fig . 14c ) . Together , the large - scale interaction analyses affirm the fidelity of DHS - promoter pairings based on correlated DNaseI sensitivity signals at distal and promoter DHSs . Most promoters were assigned to more than one distal DHS , suggesting the existence of combinatorial distal regulatory inputs for most genes ( Fig . 5b and Supplementary Table 7 ) . A similar result is forthcoming from large - scale 5C interaction data 32 . Surprisingly , roughly half of the promoter - paired distal DHSs were assigned to more than one promoter ( Fig . 5b ; Supplementary Methods ) , indicating that human cis - regulatory circuitry is significantly more complicated than previously anticipated , and may serve to reinforce the robustness of cellular transcriptional programs . The number of distal DHSs connected with a particular promoter provides , for the first time , a quantitative measure of the overall regulatory complexity of that gene . We asked whether there are any systematic functional features of genes with highly complex regulation . We ranked all human genes by the number of distal DHSs paired with the promoter of each gene , then performed a Gene Ontology analysis on the rank - ordered list . We found that the most complexly regulated human genes were strikingly enriched in immune system functions ( Supplementary Fig . 14d ) , indicating that the complexity of cellular and environmental signals processed by the immune system is directly encoded in the cis - regulatory architecture of its constituent genes . Thurman et al . Page 6 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 July 24 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Next , we asked whether DHS - promoter pairings reflected systematic relationships between specific combinations of regulatory factors ( Supplementary Methods ) . For example , KLF4 , SOX2 , OCT4 , and NANOG are known to form a well - characterized transcriptional network controlling the pluripotent state of embryonic stem cells 33 . We found significant enrichment ( P < 0 . 05 ) of the KLF4 , SOX2 , and OCT4 motifs within distal DHSs correlated with promoter DHSs containing the NANOG motif ; enrichment of NANOG , SOX2 , and OCT4 distal motifs co - occurring with promoter OCT4 ; and enrichment of distal SOX2 and OCT4 motifs with promoter SOX2 ( Supplementary Fig . 15a ) . By contrast , promoters containing KLF4 motifs were associated with KLF4 - containing distal DHSs , but not with DHSs containing NANOG , SOX2 , or OCT4 motifs ( Supplementary Fig . 15a , bottom ) . We also tested for significant co - associations between promoter types ( defined by the presence of cognate motif classes ; see Supplementary Methods ) and motifs in paired distal DHSs ( Fig . 5c and Supplementary Fig . 15b , c ) . For example , when a member of the ETS domain family ( motifs ETS1 , ETS2 , ELF1 , ELK1 , NERF , SPIB , and others ) is present within a promoter DHS , motif PU . 1 is significantly more likely to be observed in a correlated distal ( P < 10 - 5 ) . These results suggest that a limited set of general rules may govern the pairing of co - regulated distal DHSs with particular promoters . Stereotyped chromatin accessibility parallels function In addition to the synchronized activation of distal DHSs and promoters described above , we observed a surprising degree of patterned co - activation among distal DHSs , with nearly identical cross - cell - type patterns of chromatin accessibility at groups of DHSs widely separated in trans ( Supplementary Figs . 16 , 17 ) . For many patterns , we observed tens or even hundreds of like elements around the genome . The simplest explanation is that such co - activated sites share recognition motifs for the same set of regulatory factors . We found , however , that the underlying sequence features for a given pattern were surprisingly plastic . This suggests that the same pattern of cell - selective chromatin accessibility shared between two DHSs can be achieved by distinct mechanisms , likely involving complex combinatorial tuning . We next asked whether distal DHSs with specific functions such as enhancers exhibited stereotypical patterning , and whether such patterning could highlight other elements with the same function . We examined one of the best - characterized human enhancers , DNaseI hypersensitive site 2 ( HS2 ) of the beta - globin locus control region 16 - 18 . HS2 is detected in many cell types , but exhibits potent enhancer activity only in erythroid cells 34 . Using a pattern - matching algorithm ( see Supplementary Methods ) we identified additional DHSs with nearly identical cross - cell - type accessibility patterns ( Fig . 6a ) . We selected 20 elements across the spectrum of the top 200 matches to the HS2 pattern , and tested these in transient transfection assays in K562 cells ( Supplementary Methods ) . Seventy percent ( 14 / 20 ) of these displayed enhancer activity ( mean 8 . 4 - fold over control ) ( Fig . 6a , f ) . Of note , one ( “E3” ) showed a greater magnitude of enhancement ( 18 - fold vs . control ) than HS2 , which is itself one of the most potent known enhancers 4 . Next we selected 3 elements from the 14 HS2 - like enhancers , applied pattern matching ( Methods ) to each to identify stereotyped elements , and tested samples of each pattern for enhancer activity , revealing additional K562 enhancers ( total 15 / 25 positive ) ( Fig . 6b - d , f ) . In each case , therefore , we were able to discover enhancers by simply anchoring on the cross - cell - type DHS pattern of an element with enhancer activity . Collectively , these results show that co - activation of DHSs reflected in cross - cell - type patterning of chromatin accessibility is predictive of functional activity within a specific cell type , and suggests more generally that DHSs with stereotyped cellular patterning are likely to fulfill similar functions .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t To visualize the qualities and prevalence of different stereotyped cross - cellular DHS patterns , we constructed a self - organizing map ( SOM ) of a random 10 % subsample of DHSs across all cell types and identified a total of 1 , 225 distinct stereotyped DHS patterns ( Supplementary Figs . 18 , 19 ) . Many of the stereotyped patterns discovered by the SOM encompass large numbers of DHSs , with some counting > 1000 elements ( Supplementary Fig . 20 ) . Taken together , the above results show that chromatin accessibility at regulatory DNA is highly choreographed across large sets of co - activated elements distributed throughout the genome , and that DHSs with similar cross - cell - type activation profiles are likely to share similar functions . Genetic variation in regulatory DNA linked to mutation rate The DHS compartment as a whole is under evolutionary constraint , which varies between different classes and locations of elements 35 , and may be heterogeneous within individual elements 36 . To understand the evolutionary forces shaping regulatory DNA sequences in humans , we estimated nucleotide diversity ( π ) in DHSs using publicly available whole - genome sequencing data from 53 unrelated individuals 37 ( see Supplementary Methods ) . We restricted our analysis to nucleotides outside of exons and RepeatMasked regions . To provide a comparison with putatively neutral sites , we computed π in four - fold degenerate synonymous positions ( third positions ) of coding exons . This analysis showed that , taken together , DHSs exhibit lower π than four - fold degenerate sites , compatible with the action of purifying selection . Fig . 7a shows π for the DHSs of all analyzed cell types , with color coding to indicate the origin of each cell type . Particularly striking is the distribution of diversity relative to proliferative potential . DHSs in cells with limited proliferative potential have uniformly lower average diversity than immortal cells , with the difference most pronounced in malignant and pluripotent lines . This ordering is identical when highly mutable CpG nucleotides are removed from the analysis . If differences in π are due to mutation rate differences in different DHS compartments , the ratio of human polymorphism to human - chimpanzee divergence should remain constant across cell types . By contrast , differences in π due to selective constraint should result in pronounced differences . To distinguish between these alternatives , we first compared polymorphism and human - chimp divergence for DHSs from normal , malignant , and pluripotent cells ( Fig . 7b ) . Differences in polymorphism and divergence between these three groups are nearly identical , compatible with a mutational cause . Second , raw mutation rate is expected to affect rare and common genetic variation equally , whereas selection is likely to have a larger impact on common variation . We consistently observe ~ 62 % of SNPs in DHSs of each group to have derived - allele frequencies below 0 . 05 . DHSs in different cell lines exhibit differences in SNP densities but not in allele frequency distribution ( Fig . 7c ) . Collectively , these observations are consistent with increased relative mutation rates in the DHS compartment of immortal cells vs . cell types with limited proliferative potential , exposing an unexpected link between chromatin accessibility , proliferative potential , and patterns of human variation . DISCUSSION Since their discovery over 30 years ago , DNaseI hypersensitive sites have guided the discovery of diverse cis - regulatory elements in the human and other genomes . Here we have presented by far the most comprehensive map of human regulatory DNA , revealing novel relationships between chromatin accessibility , transcription , DNA methylation , and the Thurman et al .

The wide spectrum of different cell and tissue types covered by our data greatly expands the horizons of cell - selective gene regulation analysis , enabling the recognition of systematic long - distance regulatory patterns , and previously undescribed phenomena such as stereotyping of DHS activation and mutation rate variation in normal vs . immortal cells . The extensive resources we have provided should greatly facilitate future analyses , and stimulate new areas of investigation into the organization and control of the human genome . METHODS SUMMARY DNaseI hypersensitivity mapping was performed using protocols developed by Duke 7 or UW 8 on a total of 125 cell - types ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Datasets were sequenced to an average depth of 30 million uniquely mapping sequence tags ( 27 - 35 bp for UW and 20 bp for Duke ) per replicate . For uniformity of analysis , some cell type data sets that exceeded 40M tag depth were randomly sub sampled to a depth of 30 million tags . Sequence reads were mapped using the Bowtie aligner , allowing a maximum of two mismatches . Only reads mapping uniquely to the genome were used in our analyses . Mappings were to male or female versions of hg19 / GRCh37 , depending on cell type , with random regions omitted . Data were analyzed jointly using a single algorithm 7 ( Supplementary Methods ) to localize DNaseI hypersensitive sites . H3K4me3 ChIP - seq was performed using antibody 9751 ( Cell Signaling ) on 1 % formaldehyde crosslinked samples sheared by Diagenode bioruptor . Gene expression measurements for each cell type were performed on Affymetrix Human Exon microarrays . 5C experiments were performed as described 31 , 32 . Transcription factor recognition motif occurrences within DHSs were defined with FIMO 38 at significance P < 10 - 5 using motif models from the TRANSFAC database .
