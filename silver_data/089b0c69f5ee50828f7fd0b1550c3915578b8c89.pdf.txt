A single long axon protrudes from the cell body , guided to its target by molecules such as chemoattractants and chemorepel - lents , which regulate the motility of growth cones at the tip of the axon 1 . Although several lines of evidence suggest that the actin cytoskeleton is pivotal in regulating growth cone motility , little is known about the regulatory mechanisms by which the guidance molecules influence cytoskeletal rearrangements . Semaphorin ( Sema ) 3A is a chemorepulsive axonal guidance molecule that induces growth cone collapse of dorsal root gan - glia ( DRG ) neurons 1 . Sema 3A binds to its specific receptor , a plexin – neuropilin - 1 complex , at the surface of growth cones 2 , 3 . Two cytosolic factors , CRMP 4 – 6 and rac1 ( refs . 7 – 9 ) , together with a trimeric G protein 4 , 10 , are involved in the signal trans - duction cascade for Sema 3A - induced growth cone collapse . Sema 3A acts as a chemorepulsive and chemoattractive guidance mol - ecule for axons and dendrites of cortical neurons , respectively 11 , suggesting that local regulation of intracellular signaling deter - mines whether the neurites protrude or retract in response to Sema 3A . Thus , to understand axon guidance , it is important to identify not only the extracellular guidance molecules but also the intracellular signaling pathway and its regulatory mechanism . In growth cones , actin filaments are depolymerized for the retrac - tion of lamellipodia and filopodia during the Sema 3A - induced collapse 12 , whereas molecular events involving actin depolymer - ization are largely unknown . LIM - kinase is a cytosolic Ser / Thr kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates cofilin 13 , 14 , an actin - depolymerizing factor 15 , 16 , to interact with actin 17 , 18 . Both PAK 19 and ROCK 20 , 21 kinases phosphorylate Thr - 508 of LIM - kinase and activate the kinase . LIM - kinase 1 is expressed predominantly in both the peripheral and central nervous system including the inner nuclear layer of the retina , the cortex , the developing spinal cord , the cranial nerve and the dorsal root ganglia 22 . A decrease in expression of several proteins including LIM - kinase 1 induces nervous system impair - ment , resulting in Williams syndrome 23 . Thus , LIM - kinase 1 is speculated to be involved in the development of the nervous sys - tem by regulating actin dynamics in neuronal cells . Cofilin is a strongly expressed actin - binding protein 15 , 16 in the nervous system of vertebrates 24 . It binds to actin in a one - to - one molar ratio , and stimulates both the severing of actin fil - aments and depolymerization of actin subunits from the actin filament end 25 . Cofilin is inactivated by PIP 226 and by LIM - kinase 13 , 14 . Cofilin stimulates cell movements such as chemo - taxis 27 , and is necessary for phagocytosis 28 and cytokinesis 29 in various eukaryotic cells . In dorsal root ganglia neurons , cofilin is densely localized at the tips of the growth cones 24 , but its role and regulation in neuronal development is not yet understood . To determine whether Sema 3A regulates actin dynamics through the action of cofilin , we examined the effect of Sema 3A on the phosphorylation of cofilin at the growth cone using an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated but not unphosphory - articles Phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM - kinase is necessary for semaphorin 3A - induced growth cone collapse Hiroyuki Aizawa 1 , 6 , Shuji Wakatsuki 1 , Ai Ishii 1 , Kenji Moriyama 1 , Yukio Sasaki 2 , Kazumasa Ohashi 3 , Yoko Sekine - Aizawa 4 , 6 , Atsuko Sehara - Fujisawa 1 , Kensaku Mizuno 3 , Yoshio Goshima 2 , 5 and Ichiro Yahara 1 1 Department of Cell Biology , Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science , Honkomagome 3 - 18 - 22 , Bunkyo - ku , Tokyo 113 - 8613 , Japan 2 Department of Pharmacology , Yokohama City University School of Medicine , Yokohama 236 - 0004 , Japan 3 Biological Institute , Graduate School of Science , Tohoku University , Sendai 980 - 8578 , Japan 4 Laboratory for Proteolytic Neuroscience , RIKEN Brain Science Institute , 2 - 1 Wako - shi , Saitama 351 - 0198 , Japan 5 CREST , Japan Science and Technology Corporation ( JST ) , Kawaguchi 332 - 0012 , Japan 6 Present address : Department of Neuroscience , Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , 725 North Wolfe Street , Baltimore , Maryland 21205 , USA Correspondence should be addressed to H . A . ( aizawa @ rr . iij4u . or . jp ) Semaphorin 3A is a chemorepulsive axonal guidance molecule that depolymerizes the actin cytoskele - ton and collapses growth cones of dorsal root ganglia neurons . Here we investigate the role of LIM - kinase 1 , which phosphorylates an actin - depolymerizing protein , cofilin , in semaphorin 3A - induced growth cone collapse . Semaphorin 3A induced phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of cofilin at growth cones sequentially . A synthetic cell - permeable peptide containing a cofilin phosphorylation site inhibited LIM - kinase in vitro and in vivo , and essentially suppressed semaphorin 3A - induced growth cone collapse . A dominant - negative LIM kinase , which could not be activated by PAK or ROCK , suppressed the collapsing activity of semaphorin 3A . Phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM - kinase may be a critical signaling event in growth cone collapse by semaphorin 3A . © 2001 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / n e u r o sc i . n a t u r e . c o m © 2001 Nature Publishing Group http : / / neurosci . nature . com Fig . 1 .

Here we report that Sema 3A increased and subse - quently decreased the phosphorylation of cofilin at the collapsing growth cones , indicating that cofilin phosphorylation by LIM - kinase is necessary for Sema 3A - induced growth cone collapse . R ESULTS Sema 3A increases phosphorylation of cofilin To determine whether Sema 3A regulates actin dynamics through the action of cofilin , we examined the effect of Sema 3A on the phosphorylation level of cofilin in cells expressing Sema 3A recep - tor complex , which shrinks rapidly in response to Sema 3A 2 , using an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated but not the unphosphorylated form of cofilin ( Fig . 1a – d ) . The anti - phos - phorylated cofilin antibody specifically recognized the phos - phorylated form of cofilin and its isoform , destrin , among total DRG proteins ( Fig . 1a ) . The anti - phosphorylated cofilin anti - body did not react with bacterially expressed cofilin , whereas the antibody reacted with the cofilin phosphorylated by LIM - kinase in vitro ( Fig . 1b ) . Sema 3A stimulated phosphorylation of cofil - in in COS7 cells expressing Sema 3A receptor complex within one minute ( Fig . 1c ) . Quantitative analysis revealed that Sema 3A increased phosphorylation of cofilin 2 . 5 - fold within 5 min - utes ( Fig . 1d ) . After five minutes , the phosphorylation level of cofilin gradually decreased . Sema 3A did not increase the phos - phorylation level of cofilin in cells that did not express the recep - tor complex ( Fig . 1d ) . These data suggest that Sema 3A stimulates phosphorylation and subsequent dephosphorylation of cofilin through its receptor . To investigate the effect of Sema 3A on phosphorylation of cofilin at DRG growth cones that express the Sema 3A receptor , we stained DRG explant culture neurons using the anti - phos - phocofilin antibody ( Fig . 1e – g ) .

Sema 3A induces growth cone collapse with - in ten minutes . The growth cones that were treated with Sema 3A for one minute were stained very brightly with the anti - phosphorylated cofilin antibody , but staining of the axon shafts was not as bright ( Fig . 1f ) . Sema 3A may activate cofilin kinase only at the collapsing growth cones where Sema 3A receptor functions . Quantitative analysis of fluorescent images revealed that Sema 3A increased phosphorylation of cofilin 3 . 5 - fold with - in 1 minute at the growth cones ( Fig . 1h ) . However , after a five - minute treatment with Sema 3A , phosphorylated cofilin staining decreased to 0 . 16 - fold of untreated growth cone staining ( Fig . 1g and h ) . This indicates that cofilin is phosphorylated and subsequently dephosphorylated at growth cones by Sema 3A as is the case in COS7 cells expressing the Sema 3A receptor ( Fig . 1c and d ) . This sequential phosphorylation and dephos - phorylation of cofilin may be required for the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton during growth cone collapse . Western blot - ting using the phosphocofilin antibody revealed that the total level of phosphorylated cofilin in DRG neurons was not altered significantly by Sema 3A treatment ( data not shown ) , support - ing the notion that Sema 3A - induced phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is localized at the growth cones . To investigate the involvement of phosphorylation of cofilin in reorganization of actin filaments during Sema 3A - induced growth cone collapse , we examined intracellular distribution and quan - titation of cofilin , phosphorylated cofilin and actin filaments ( Fig . 2 ) . Actin filaments localized at filopodia and lamellipodia of growth cones ( Fig . 2a , 0 min ) . Cofilin colocalized with the peripheral actin filaments ( Fig . 2a , 0 min , asterisks ) , whereas phosphorylated cofilin did not ( Fig . 2a , 0 min ) . This suggests that cofilin promotes rapid turnover of the peripheral actin fil - aments for growth cone protrusion . With a three - minute treat - ment of Sema 3A , lamellipodia of the growth cones stopped protruding 12 . In the growth cones , cofilin was phosphorylated and accumulated at the body of the growth cone ( Fig . 2a , 3 min , double arrowheads ) . Double staining of actin filaments and total cofilin showed that cofilin was dissociated from the peripheral actin filaments ( Fig . 2a , 3 min ) . Quantitative analysis revealed that the amount of total actin filaments in a single growth cone increased 1 . 3 - fold after 3 - minute treatment with Sema 3A ( Fig . 2b ) . The amount of phosphorylated cofilin increased 1 . 9 - fold at growth cones after 3 - minute treatment with Sema 3A , whereas that of total cofilin did not ( Fig . 2b ) . These results sug - gest that the phosphorylation of cofilin stabilizes peripheral actin filaments at growth cones after three - minute treatment with Sema 3A . With a 10 - minute treatment with Sema 3A , actin fila - ments were depolymerized , and the amount of phosphorylated cofilin at the growth cone dramatically decreased ( Fig . 2a , 10 min ; Fig . 2b ) . Dephosphorylation of cofilin reactivates cofilin , and may be involved in rapid actin depolymerization at growth cones during the Sema 3A - induced collapse . LIM - kinase is necessary for Sema 3A activity To evaluate the involvement of cofilin phosphorylation in Sema 3A - induced growth cone collapse , we designed a synthetic peptide , S3 - peptide , containing the unique phosphorylation site of cofilin as a competitive inhibitor for cofilin - kinase , and a pen - etratin sequence that allowed the peptide to be internalized from the cell culture medium ( Fig . 3a ) 30 . The peptide inhibited con - stitutively active LIM - kinase ( CA - LIM - kinase , see below ) from phosphorylating cofilin in a dose - dependent manner in vitro ( Fig . 3b ) . We also synthesized a control peptide , reverse - peptide , com - posed of the amino - terminal reverse sequence of the cofilin phos - phorylation site and the normal penetratin internalization sequence . The addition of S3 - or RV - peptide ( 10 µ g / ml ) to the culture medium did not alter the morphology of growth cones ( Fig . 3c , – Sema 3A ) . Cell staining with anti - pCof antibody revealed that S3 - but not RV - peptide inhibited phos - phorylation of cofilin in DRG neurons ( Fig . 3c , – Sema 3A ) . S3 - peptide ( 20 µ g / ml ) but not RV - peptide ( 20 µ g / ml ) inhibited the Sema 3A - induced growth cone collapse ( Fig . 3c , + Sema 3A ) . Fol - lowing the removal of the S3 - peptide from the culture medium , Sema 3A caused the complete collapse of the growth cones , sug - articles Fig . 3 .

S3 - peptide without the penetratin internalization sequence did not inhibit Sema 3A - induced growth cone collapse ( data not shown ) . In the absence of the S3 - peptide , Sema 3A essentially col - lapsed all growth cones ( Fig . 3a ) . In the presence of 10 µ g / ml S3 - peptide , we detected short filopodia even after a 20 - minute treatment with Sema 3A ( Fig . 3d ) , and long filopodia and small lamellipodia at the Sema 3A - treated growth cones using 20 µ g / ml S3 - peptide ( Fig . 3d ) . The addition of 40 µ g / ml S3 - peptide essen - tially inhibited Sema 3A ( Fig . 3d ) . Quantitative analysis of growth cone collapse induced by Sema 3A revealed that S3 - peptide but not RV - peptide inhibited growth cone collapse in a dose - depen - dent manner ( Fig . 3e ) . The S3 - peptide effectively attenuated col - lapse at concentrations of 10 µ g / ml and higher ( Fig . 3d and e ) , which corresponds to the concentrations at which it can inhibit cofilin phosphorylation in vitro ( Fig . 3b ) and in vivo ( Fig . 3c ) . These results imply that the phosphorylation of cofilin is neces - sary for growth cone collapse induced by Sema 3A . LIM - kinase 1 is an important regulator of cofilin phospho - rylation 13 , 14 , and inhibits the binding of cofilin to actin 17 , 18 . LIM - kinase 1 is predominantly expressed in the nervous sys - tem , including DRG neurons 22 . Thus , LIM - kinase 1 is a good candidate for the cofilin kinase that is activated by Sema 3A at the growth cones of DRG neurons . To examine the involvement of LIM - kinase in growth cone collapse , we expressed a mutant LIM - kinase ( DN - LIM - kinase ) in which Thr - 508 was substitut - ed with Val 31 using the Sindbis virus expression system ( Fig . 4 ) . Because LIM - kinase is activated by phosphorylation at its Thr - 508 by PAK or ROCK 19 – 21 , the DN - LIM - kinase may dom - inantly inhibit the PAK - or ROCK - dependent activation of intrinsic LIM - kinase . We confirmed that the expression of DN - LIM - kinase could decrease the level of phosphorylated cofilin at least in cultured BHK cells ( Fig . 4a ) . The expression of DN - LIM - kinase in DRG neurons did not affect the morphology of growth cones ( Fig . 4b , 0 nM ) , suggesting that the activation of LIM - kinase is not necessary for growth cone protrusion . On the other hand , DN - LIM - kinase significantly suppressed Sema 3A - induced growth cone collapse ( Fig . 4b and c ) . Furthermore , we investigated the distribution of phosphorylated cofilin at growth cones that express DN - LIM - kinase ( Fig . 4d ) . In control neurons , we observed a strong staining of anti - pCof antibody at the collapsing growth cones one minute after Sema 3A treat - ment ( Fig . 4d , Mock ) . On the other hand , we did not observe such a strong signal at the growth cones of DRG neurons expressing DN - LIM - kinase at one minute after Sema 3A treat - ment ( Fig . 4d , DN ) . This result suggests that DN - LIM - kinase dominantly inhibits Sema 3A - induced phosphorylation of cofil - in at the growth cone . Even at three minutes after Sema 3A treatment , we could find well - expanding growth cones with - out accumulation of phosphorylated cofilin ( Fig . 4d , DN ) . At ten minutes after Sema 3A treatment , almost all the growth cones were very weakly stained by anti - pCof antibody ( Fig . 4d , 10 min ) . These data suggest that the activation of LIM - kinase is necessary for Sema 3A - induced growth cone collapse . LIM - kinase regulates growth cone morphology Is the activation of LIM - kinase sufficient for growth cone collapse ? To answer this question , we expressed a CA - LIM - kinase , in which Gly - 177 was substituted with Glu and Leu - 178 was substituted with Ala in the PDZ domain 31 , in DRG neurons using the Sindbis virus expression system ( Fig . 5 ) . To confirm that CA - LIM - kinase could act as a constitutive active type of LIM - kinase in cells 31 , we expressed CA - LIM - kinase in cultured COS7 cells , which led to a threefold increase in phosphorylated cofilin ( Fig . 5a ) . Next , we expressed the CA - LIM - kinase in cultured DRG neurons ( Fig . 5b – d ) . The expres - sion induced filopodia - rich sticky growth cones without lamel - lipodia ( Fig . 5b , CA ) . This sticky growth cone morphology was completely reversed within 20 minutes by addition of S3 - peptide into the medium ( Fig . 5b and c ) . Cell staining with anti - Cof anti - body and anti - pCof antibody revealed that CA - LIM - kinase phos - phorylated cofilin at the growth cones of DRG cultured neurons ( Fig . 5d ) . Thus , the kinase activity of the CA - LIM - kinase may cause the sticky morphology of growth cones . These results suggest that activation of LIM - kinase is partly involved in the morphological change induced by Sema 3A , although the activation is not suffi - cient for Sema 3A - induced growth cone collapse . To examine whether LIM - kinase is involved in neurite outgrowth , we compared the neurite length using DRG explant cultured neurons ( Fig . 6 ) . We found that expression of DN - LIM - kinase or CA - LIM - articles 370 Fig . 4 . Effects of dominant - negative ( DN ) - LIM - kinase on growth cone collapse by Sema 3A .

We also demonstrated that addition of 40 µ g / ml S3 - or RV - peptide caused little effect on neurite growth of DRG neurons ( Fig . 6f ) . These results suggest that LIM - kinase is not necessary for neurite out - growth , and that LIM - kinase is not sufficient for neurite retraction . D ISCUSSION Motility of the growth cone is regulated by extracellular axon guidance molecules , which bind to their specific receptors on the plasma membrane 1 . Because the actin cytoskeleton is central in cell motility , the activated receptors may regulate actin dynamics within the growth cones . Actin dynamics are regu - lated by three mechanisms : formation of nuclei for polymer - ization , filament elongation and depolymerization 32 . The Arp 2 / 3 complex functions as a nucleation site for actin to poly - merize and subsequently increase in filament number under the control of cdc 42 , a small GTPase 33 – 37 . Profilin stimulates actin polymerization on the end of pre - existing fila - ments under the control of VASP / Ena protein 38 , 39 . The actin filaments are depolymerized by cofilin under the control of LIM - kinase 13 – 15 . At present , however , little is known about the link between the receptors of axon guidance molecules and the three actin - regulatory mechanisms . Here we report that a chemorepellent guidance molecule , Sema 3A , regu - lates actin dynamics via the LIM - kinase - cofilin depolymerizing mechanism . Cofilin is an actin - depolymerizing protein 15 that is essential for endocytosis 28 , cytokinesis 29 and cell viability 40 , 41 . Cofilin binds to actin in a one - to - one molar ratio , and severs actin fila - ments and enhances depolymerization of actin filaments in a sto - ichiometric manner 25 . Once cofilin depolymerizes actin from the end of filaments , the cofilin is inactivated , because the depoly - merized actin molecule forms a sequestered actin – cofilin het - erodimer . Thus , we proposed that the sequestered cofilin should be reactivated by some unidentified mechanism to promote the effective turnover of actin filaments . In COS7 cells expressing the Sema 3A receptor , Sema 3A induced receptor - dependent rapid increase and subsequent gradual decrease in phosphorylation of cofilin ( Fig . 1a – d ) . Sema 3A also induced the rapid phosphorylation and subsequent quick dephos - phorylation of cofilin at the collapsing growth cone ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . The time course of polymerization and depoly - merization of actin filaments correlates well with phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of cofilin , respectively , at growth cones after the Sema 3A treatment ( Fig . 2 ) . The phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM - kinase 1 is necessary but not sufficient for Sema 3A - induced growth cone collapse ( Figs . 3 – 5 ) . We speculate that activation of other proteins such as cofilin phosphatase or myosin may also be involved in growth cone collapse . Because LIM - kinase 1 inhibits the interaction of cofilin with actin by phosphorylation of Ser - 3 , articles Fig . 5 .

The dissociated actin could polymerize into filaments , causing a net actin polymerization . On the other hand , the phosphorylated cofil - in is still inactive but competent for reactivation by dephosphory - lation , which we suspect to occur during the onset of growth cone collapse by a yet unidentified phosphatase . This reactivation may induce severing and depolymerization of actin filaments required for rapid growth cone collapse . In human T lymphocytes , serine phosphatases PP1 and PP2A associate with and activate cofilin in response to co - stimulation 43 . Sema 3A might also activate these phosphatases to activate phosphorylated cofilin at growth cones . Accumulating evidence suggests that , depending on the intra - cellular concentration of cyclic nucleotides 44 , a guidance molecule can act as a chemoattractive and chemorepulsive factor in a single growth cone . This intracellular regulation of the growth cone’s response to a guidance molecule is pivotal in axonal guidance in which a guidance molecule attracts and repels an axon before and after its arrival at an intermediate axonal target , respectively . Sema 3A has been identified in a single cortical neuron as a chemoattractant and a chemorepellent for dendrites and the axon , respectively 11 . This finding suggests that intracellular local regula - tion of the signal transduction system is critical for the morpho - genesis of polar cells under the control of a single extracellular guidance molecule , Sema 3A . This temporal and spatial intracel - lular regulation of the signal transduction system is central in deter - mining the behavior of neurite extension in response to a guidance molecule . As discussed above , LIM - kinase 1 may stimulate actin depolymerization with the aid of some cofilin phosphatase . In the absence of cofilin phosphatase , however , LIM - kinase 1 may stim - ulate actin polymerization by inactivating cofilin . This suggests a mechanism by which Sema 3A may act as a repellent or attractant depending on local levels of LIM - kinase and cofilin phosphatase . The phosphorylation – dephosphorylation cycle of cofilin may also be important for efficient depolymerization of actin filaments dur - ing growth cone collapse by Sema 3A . LIM - kinase 1 is activated by rac1 via PAK in cultured fibroblasts 19 . Because rac1 is necessary for growth cone collapse induced by Sema 3A 7 – 9 , Sema 3A may activate LIM - kinase through the rac1 - PAK cascade for actin depolymerization dur - ing growth cone collapse . However , rac1 induces protrusion of lamellipodia in cultured fibroblast cells 45 . This discrepancy between phenotype of fibroblasts and that of DRG neurons would be caused by regulatory differences in the intracellular signaling mechanism . Because cofilin is phosphorylated by rac1 activa - tion 13 , 14 , actin filaments may be depolymerized and polymer - ized depending on an activated and inactivated cofilin phosphatase , respectively , in our model . Our findings suggest that LIM - kinase 1 regulates the dynam - ics of actin filaments in neuronal cells under the control of guid - ance molecules including Sema 3A , and thus is involved in the development of the nervous system . LIM - kinase 1 is predomi - nantly expressed in both the peripheral and the central nervous system 22 , and expression of LIM - kinase 1 is decreased in Williams syndrome 23 , which includes nervous system impair - ment . We speculate that a decrease in LIM - kinase 1 may cause the misdirection of growth cones , resulting in nervous system impairment , including the visual recognition and mental retar - dation in Williams syndrome . Here we report a link between the guidance molecule , Sema 3A , and an actin - depolymerizing protein , cofilin , via LIM - kinase . To understand the intracellular regulation of axonal guidance by Sema 3A , we must also determine the link between the guidance molecule and the other two actin - regulating systems , nucleation for actin polymerization and elongation of actin filaments . It is also important to know whether LIM - kinase is activated by chemore - pulsive guidance cues other than Sema 3A , to understand the com - mon pathway for neurite retraction . M ETHODS Cell culture and Sema 3A treatment . Murine embryonic day 13 DRG was dissected and cultured in 200 µ l of MEM medium containing 20 ng / ml NGF ( Gibco - BRL , Rockville , Maryland ) on a laminin - coated glass - bot - tomed culture dish for 24 h . The explant was then treated with serum - free MEM medium containing 20 ng / ml NGF for 4 h before addition of synthetic peptides and / or Sema 3A . BHK and COS7 cells were cultured in α - MEM ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , California ) containing 5 % fetal bovine serum , and DMEM ( Sigma , St . Louis , Missouri ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum , respectively . Sema 3A was purified as described 46 , and dilut - ed 10 - fold into 0 . 05 % lipid - free BSA ( Sigma ) solution just before addi - tion to the medium . Antibody preparation . An anti - serum against the phosphorylated form of cofilin was raised by injection of a synthetic phosphopeptide ( MASpG - VAVSDGVIKVF ) into rabbits . The antiserum was affinity purified by the peptide - conjugated resin column , then deprived of antibodies that react with unphosphorylated cofilin through adsorption to the unphospho - rylated peptide ( MASGVAVSDGVIKVF ) - conjugated resin . Cell staining . Cells were fixed by the addition of a tenth volume of 37 % formaldehyde into medium , and incubated for 20 min at room tem - perature . For actin filament staining , the fixed cells were treated with 1 unit / ml rhodamine - phalloidin ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , Oregon ) in PBS for 1 h . For staining of phospho - cofilin , the fixed cells were per - meabilized with cold MeOH at – 20°C for 5 minutes . The cells were then sequentially incubated with 5 - fold diluted anti - phosphocofilin anti - body and 100 - fold diluted fluorescein - conjugated anti - rabbit antibody . Cells were observed under an Axiovert 135 microscope equipped with 20 × , 40 × and 63 × objectives ( Carl Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) . Construction of expression vectors and viruses . Carboxyl - terminal flag - tagged CA - and DN - LIM - kinase cDNAs were amplified by RT - PCR from human cerebrum mRNA and constructed as described 31 . The cDNA was flanked with IRES - GFP and inserted between chicken β - actin promoter and the poly ( A ) addition signal in the mammalian expression vector for transient expression in cultured cell lines using Lipofectamine ( Gibco - BRL ) . The cDNA flanked with IRES - GFP was also inserted into the pSin - Rep5 vector and packaged into virus particles using the Sindbis Expression System ( Invitrogen ) . Routinely , 10 µ l of virus solution is more than suffi - cient to infect all the neurons in 200 - µ l culture DRG explants . Murine neu - ropilin - 1 and human plexin - A2 ( KIAA0463 ) cDNAs were inserted into mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 and pSecTag2B ( Invitrogen ) , respectively . For dual expression of both cDNAs , a DNA fragment of neu - ropilin - 1 containing CMV promoter and poly ( A ) addition signal in the pcDNA3 vector was amplified by PCR , and then inserted into Mlu I site in pSecTag2B harboring plexin - A2 . Transfection of a plasmid into COS7 cells . COS7 cells were cultured in a 24 - well dish at about 50 % confluence . An expression plasmid for human plexin A2 and murine neuropilin - 1 ( 1 . 6 µ g ) or a control mock vector , pSecTag2B ( 1 . 6 µ g , Invitrogen ) , was mixed with 100 µ l of Opti - MEM ( Gibco - BRL ) for 20 min , and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Gibco - BRL ) . After 48 h , the medium was changed to serum - free DMEM for about 4 h , and the cells were then treated with Sema 3A . Electrophoresis . Cell lysates were prepared by the addition of 10 volumes of lysate buffer ( 10 mM MOPS , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM EGTA , 2 mM EDTA , 2 mM DTT , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM β - glycerophos - phate , 2 mM o - vanadate , 2 mM PMSF , 20 mM NaF , 2 mM pyrophos - phate , 0 . 01 % leupeptin ) to harvested cells . The lysates were electrophoresed using 4 – 20 % gradient SDS - PAGE gels ( Daiichi - kagaku , articles 372 © 2001 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / n e u r o sc i . n a t u r e . c o m © 2001 Nature Publishing Group http : / / neurosci . nature . com nature neuroscience • volume 4 no 4 • april 2001 373 Japan ) 47 . Western blotting was done as described 48 using 400 - fold dilut - ed anti - flag monoclonal antibody , 50 - fold diluted anti - cofilin antiserum , and 50 - fold diluted anti - phosphocofilin as the first antibody . Kinase assay . Flag - tagged CA - LIM - kinase was expressed in BHK cells by the addition of 300 µ l of CA - LIM - kinase Sindbis virus solution to confluent cells in a 10 - cm culture dish for 36 h . Cells were harvested and lysed by the addition of 500 µ l of lysis buffer . The extract was centrifuged , and flag - tagged LIM - kinase was immunoprecipitated by 20 µ l of Protein - G - sepharose . ( His ) 6 - tagged porcine cofilin expressed in bacteria was purified as described 17 . The kinase assay solution contained 1 µ l of CA - LIM - kinase - bound Protein - G - sepharose , 6 µ M ATP , 3 µ Ci [ γ - 32 P ] ATP , 2 µ M ( His ) 6 - tagged cofilin , 50 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM MnCl 2 , and 5 mM MgCl 2 . The kinase reaction was done at 25°C for 15 min . After SDS - PAGE , the phosphate incorporated into cofilin was analyzed by autoradiography using BAS 2500 ( Fuji , Japan ) .
