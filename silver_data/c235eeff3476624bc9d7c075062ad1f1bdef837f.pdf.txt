TheCrkadaptorfamilyofproteinscomprisesthealternativelysplicedCrkIandCrkIIisoforms , aswellastheparalogCrk - like ( CrkL ) protein , which is encoded by a different gene . Initially thought to be involved in signaling during apoptosis and cell adhesion , this ubiquitously expressed family of proteins is now known to play essential roles in integrating signals from a wide range of stimuli . In this review , we describe the structure and function of the different Crk proteins . We then focus on the emerging roles of Crk adaptors during Enterobacteriaceae pathogenesis , with special emphasis on the important human pathogens Salmonella , Shigella , Yersinia , and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli . Throughout , we remark on opportunities for future research into this intriguing family of proteins . 1 . Introduction The product of the oncogene v - Crk was identified in 1988 due to its capacity to transform fibroblasts and to induce tumors in chickens and was named CT10 ( chicken tumor virus number 10 ) regulator of kinase , Crk [ 1 , 2 ] . The demonstration that the v - Crk protein was able to increase significantly the tyrosine - phosphorylation of proteins in cells without having any intrinsic kinase activity itself was a breakthrough that contributed to the description of the SH2 - phosphotyrosine interaction module which functions in cell signaling . Today , the v - Crk cellular homologs ( c - Crk ) CrkI and CrkII , together with the paralog Crk - like ( CrkL ) protein , are categorized as adaptor proteins . CrkL was first cloned as a gene implicated in chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) [ 3 ] . Soon afterward , CrkL was found to be the major phosphoprotein detected in CML cells [ 4 ] . The discovery of Crk adaptor proteins represents a milestone in the signal transduction field [ 5 , 6 ] . These proteins were first implicated in signaling during apoptosis [ 7 ] and cell adhesion and migration ( reviewed in [ 8 , 9 ] ) . Currently , this ubiquitously expressed family of proteins is known to play essential roles in integrating signals from a wide variety of cellular processes , including those more specific to the immune system [ 10 ] . In this review , we focus on the emerging roles of Crk adaptors during bacterial pathogenesis . 2 . Knockout Mouse Models CrkI and CrkII are alternatively spliced products from a gene locus located on human chromosome 17p13 . 3 [ 11 , 12 ] . CrkL is a paralog encoded by a distinct gene located on human chromosome 22q11 . 21 [ 3 ] . CrkL shares high sequence homology with CrkII , bringing into question whether the two proteins have overlapping functions and the ability to compensate for one another . Unfortunately , the different Crk knockout ( K . O . ) mouse models have not provided a simple answer to this important question . The first Crk K . O . mouse Hindawi Publishing Corporation BioMed Research International Volume 2014 , Article ID 372901 , 13 pages http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1155 / 2014 / 372901 2 BioMed Research International model was generated by gene trap insertional mutagenesis , resulting in the elimination of CrkII but not of CrkI [ 13 ] . These animals developed normally , indicating that CrkI can compensate for the absence of CrkII . Much later , complete ablation of both CrkI and CrkII was achieved and it was observed that most animals died perinatally , mainly due to vascular , cardiac , and craniofacial development defects [ 14 ] . There are two different CrkL K . O . mouse models . One was used to develop a transgenic mouse bearing the BCR - ABL fusion gene [ 15 ] . Unexpectedly , the CrkL K . O . , as well as the transgenic animals , developed leukemia and lymphoma . Furthermore , CrkII was found to be tyrosine phosphory - lated and associated with the Bcr - Abl chimeric protein in these cells , suggesting that CrkII replaced CrkL tumorigenic functions . CrkL maps to the 22q11 . 2 chromosomal region frequently deleted in heterozygosis in humans afflicted with the DiGeorge / velocardiofacial syndrome ( now referred to as 22p11DS , Orpha number ORPHA567 ) . The second CrkL K . O . mouse model was developed by the research group of Dr . Akira Imamoto ( University of Chicago ) and had severe devel - opmental alterations that recapitulated some of the defects typically found in DiGeorge syndrome , such as defects of the cranial and cardiac neural crest derivatives , including a thymus aplasia [ 16 ] that causes immunodeficiency [ 17 ] . Importantly , MEFs were produced [ 18 ] that , much later , allowed investigation into how CrkL contributes to pedestal formation by enteropathogenic E . coli . 3 . Structure Crk proteins are prototypical adaptors ( i . e . , absence of enzymatic activity ) consisting of Src homology 2 and Src homology 3 ( SH2 , SH3 ) domains . They possess one N - terminal SH2 domain , followed by one SH3 domain in the case of CrkI . However , CrkII and CrkL have two SH3 domains named according to whether they are more N - or C - terminally located , nSH3 and cSH3 , respectively ( Figure 1 ) . The predicted molecular masses are 40 and 36 kDa for CrkII and CrkL , respectively , and 28 kDa for CrkI . They undergo posttranslational modifications as discussed below . 4 . SH2 Domain The SH2 domain is an approximately 100 amino acid module with intrinsic folding capacity . Structural studies performed with the Src kinase determined that SH2 domains have two binding surfaces and consequently bind simultaneously to a phosphorylated tyrosine ( pTyr ) and to motifs containing specific residues located C - terminal to the pTyr ( residues + 1 to + 5 ) . The first pocket contains highly conserved arginine and histidine residues whose mutations abrogate phosphate binding [ 25 ] . The second binding surface is more variable and is presumed to confer binding specificity ( the specificity pocket ; reviewed in [ 26 , 27 ] ) . It is generally accepted that the consensus - binding motif for the SH2 domain of Crk proteins is pY - x - x - L / P . A closer look into the structure of the SH2 domain of CrkI and CrkII shows that , compared with CrkL , they possess CrkI SH2 nSH3 P P nSH3 nSH3 SH2 SH2 CrkII CrkL cSH 3 cSH 3 221 207 304 1 1 1 204 303 Figure1 : SchematicrepresentationofCrkadaptorproteinstructure . an extra stretch of 17 amino acids that contains a proline - rich region ( PRR ; PPVPPSPAQPPPGVSPS ; Figure 2 ) . This SH2 - confined PRR has been shown to bind the SH3 domain of Abelson murine leukemia kinase ( Abl ) [ 28 ] . The SH2 domains of CrkII and CrkL share 82 % homology . Remark - ably , and unlike SH3 domains , SH2 domain containing proteins are apparently missing in prokaryotes [ 27 ] . 5 . SH3 Domain SH3 domains are globular domains composed of approxi - mately 60 amino acids that bind to PRRs in proteins with a generic PXXP core consensus and additional specificity - determining residues in the proximity , including a positively charged arginine or lysine residue . According to the orien - tation of the motif , SH3 domains have been classified into class I ( + XXPXXP ) and class II ( PXXPX + ) [ 29 ] . The nSH3 of CrkII and CrkL share 70 % homology . In general , the nSH3 of Crk proteins binds polyproline class II motifs , although there are exceptions , such as the binding of CrkL nSH3 to the downstream of Crk 2 ( DOCK2 ) protein that uses a bipartite motif [ 30 ] . CrkII and CrkL each contain a cSH3 defined by its inability to bind to classic polyproline type II ( PPII ) motifs ( reviewed in [ 31 ] ) . Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spec - troscopy studies demonstrated that the cSH3 domain adopts the standard SH3 fold encompassing a five - stranded beta barrel ; however , its binding surface contains several polar residues ( such as glutamine and histidine ) which suggests it may not bind typical PXXP ligands or that it may bind them with reduced affinity [ 32 ] . Thus , only one interaction has been described so far with the major nuclear export receptor named chromosome maintenance region - 1 Crm1 / exportin [ 33 ] . In fact , the binding site contains a nuclear localization signal ( amino acids 256 - 266 in the human sequence ) . There - fore , the cSH3 domain allows for the nuclear export of CrkII and CrkL ( see the nuclear import / export section ) . 6 . Regulation The nSH3 and cSH3 domains are bound by an approximately 50 - residue - long linker ( spacer ) region that contains the so - termed regulatory tyrosines , Y221 in CrkII and Y207 in CrkL . It was proposed early on that the phosphorylated Y221 BioMed Research International 3 5 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 7 5 8 8 8 4 9 6 8 7 76 M MSSAR RRR DDDDDD ARARFFFF MA AAAWWW WWWGGGGGGPV Q Q G GMMMVV VVV VV V VVVVVV VVVVV VLLLLLLVVVVV V VFFFFFFLLLLLLGGGGG GGGGGQQQQQQQQQQQQ TR RD DYYYYYYDDDDD SSSSSSS SSSSSS CPGGGGGGPPPPPCCSSSTTTTTTSS S SHYIIIIIIINSLPP PPPPPP PAQQQAAPPPPPPPPPGVVVGGPP PPP RRRPP -

Note the low homology of mouse CrkII . 4 BioMed Research International of CrkII could bind to its own SH2 domain [ 34 ] . Later , such a mechanism was also demonstrated for CrkL [ 35 ] and further confirmed using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) biosensor ( [ 36 ] ; see below ) . CrkI regulation must be different because it lacks the regulatory tyrosine , a characteristic that was long ago presumed to be associated with its greater transforming activity [ 37 ] . The CrkI and CrkII structure were studied using small - angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) and nuclear magnetic reso - nance ( NMR ) spectroscopy ( [ 38 ] , commented on in [ 39 ] ) . The authors reported that residues 224 – 237 , which are miss - ing in CrkI , constitute an important regulatory element in CrkII called the inter - SH3 core ( ISC ) . The ISC establishes contacts with the SH2 and SH3 domains to assemble CrkII into a compact structure in which the binding site of SH2 is exposed , but the SH2 domain masks the nSH3 domain . However , the cSH3 domain also contributes to the stability of the structure . It was also proposed that phosphorylation of the regulatory tyrosine not only blocks the SH2 domain , but also hides the binding surface of the nSH3 domain , generating a fully inhibited molecule . By contrast , CrkI has an extended structure in which both SH2 and nSH3 are freely accessible for interactions with target proteins . cis - trans isomerization of P238 in chicken CrkII mediated by peptidyl - prolyl - cis - trans isomerases ( PPIases ) was pro - posed to be another regulatory element . In the cis confor - mation the nSH3 binding surface would be blocked by P238 and other residues from the cSH3 acting as a “reversible lid” ( [ 40 ] ; reviewed in [ 41 ] ) . However the sequence around the corresponding proline in human CrkII and CrkL ( P237 ) is not well conserved , making the existence of such a regulatory mechanism less probable in human Crk [ 31 ] . A recent NMR spectroscopy study ( [ 42 ] ; discussed in [ 43 ] ) pointed towards a distinct regulation for CrkL ( see below ) . 7 . Crk and Abl Kinases : Mutual Regulation The Abl family of kinases , named after the Abelson murine leukemia virus ( v - Abl ) oncogene , comprises Abl and Arg ( Abl - related gene ; also known as Abl2 ) . This family of non - receptor tyrosine kinases has a modular structure , which includes one SH2 and one SH3 domain . They have a complex regulation and they play essential roles in regulating the actin - cytoskeleton , as indicated by the presence of an actin - binding domain in their C - terminus ( reviewed in [ 44 ] ) . The functional relationships between Crk and Abl are bidirectional ( reviewed in [ 45 ] ) . The regulatory tyrosine of Crk adaptors is phosphorylated by the Abl family kinases [ 35 ] . The Crk nSH3 domain interacts with PRRs in Abl and induces its transactivation [ 46 ] , which results in phosphory - lation of Crk . In addition , phosphorylation of Y251 within the cSH3 of CrkII promotes a similar Abl transactivation [ 47 ] . CML and some adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) patients frequently present the so called Bcr - Abl fusion protein , generated by a reciprocal chromosomal transloca - tion ( t ( 9 ; 22 ) ( q34 ; q11 ) ) that originates from the “Philadelphia chromosome” [ 48 ] . The chimeric protein generated possesses a prominent disease - associated kinase activity that phospho - rylates CrkL . An elegant recent NMR spectroscopy study has uncov - ered a different global organization for CrkII and CrkL that would explain the predilection of the Bcr - Abl fusion protein for CrkL over CrkII [ 42 , 43 ] . CrkL forms a constitutive complex with Bcr - Abl . Moreover , binding of phosphorylated Tyr207 ( or any other phosphotyrosine ) to the SH2 domain has no effect on the nSH3 that is still available to bind Bcr - Abl . In contrast , the association of CrkII with the kinase is repressed in at least two of the four proposed conformational states of the protein . 8 . Crk Nuclear Import / Export Although Crk adaptor proteins can enter the nucleus , the mechanisms governing their nuclear import / export are not well characterized . These proteins seem not to have a cognate nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) ; therefore , it is thought that they are imported through their interaction with other proteins that contain an NLS [ 49 ] . On the contrary , they have a typical nuclear export signal ( NES ) located in the cSH3 , as previously mentioned . It has been reported that the translocation of CrkII to the nucleus is mediated by the interaction of the nSH3 domain with the cell cycle protein Wee1 , DOCK180 , or Abl . For example , in the complex formed by WeeI - CrkII , the NES of the latter is masked , keeping Crk in the nucleus , where the complex has pro - apoptotic functions . CrkL nuclear export is mediated by the interaction with CrmI / exportin [ 33 ] . The cSH3 domain of CrkL can exist in monomeric or dimeric conformations in which partial unfolding of the domain exposes the NES [ 50 ] . A CrkL and CrmI complex is then formed that can be exported out of the nucleus . It is possible that CrkII shares this mechanism , taking into account the homology ( 93 % ) between their cSH3 domains . In addition , type I interferons signal for STAT5 phosphorylation , allowing the interaction with the CrkL SH2 domain [ 51 , 52 ] . The CrkL - SH2 domain - phospho - STAT5 complex can translocate to the nucleus where it binds to the promoter region of c - Abl or Bcr - Abl in CML cells [ 52 ] . 9 . Crk Signaling Complexes The current paradigm in the signaling of Crk adaptors is that interactions through the nSH3 are constitutive , while binding to the SH2 domain is primarily inducible . In other words , their SH2 domain senses pathway activation by upstream tyrosine kinases . However , phosphotyrosine signaling is now envisioned as more dynamic [ 53 ] , with complex formation depending on protein availability , affinity of the implicated domains , post - translational modifications , and other factors . CrkII itself and some of its key partners are focal adhesion ( FA ) proteins . FAs are multiprotein complexes containing plasma membrane - associated integrins that link the extracel - lular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton ( reviewed in [ 54 , 55 ] ) . Two of the first binding partners described for Crk were the p130 Crk - associated substrate ( p130Cas ; [ 56 , 57 ] ; reviewed in [ 58 , 59 ] ) and paxillin [ 60 ] . p130Cas is an adaptor protein BioMed Research International 5 whose tyrosine phosphorylation provides binding sites for the Crk SH2 domain and its association via the nSH3 domain with DOCK180 , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) that switches the small GTPase Rac1 to the GTP - bound active state [ 61 ] . FA formation and dynamics are challenging subjects to investigate because many different molecular assemblies of proteins are formed that are difficult to dissect . FAs are enriched in kinases , such as focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) and Src family kinases ( SFK ) . FAK is recruited to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin receptors . In one of the most studied cell adhesion pathways , a FAK - Src complex is formed that promotes paxillin and p130Cas phosphorylation at FAs . The adaptor protein p130Cas contains binding - sites not only for Crk , as mentioned above , but also for FAK , Nck , and Src . Many proteins found at FAs participate in the formation of other “adhesive structures” such as the so - called “phago - cytic cup . ” Ig - opsonized pathogens are phagocytosed by pro - fessional phagocytes , mainly macrophages and neutrophils , as well as by M cells in the intestine , in a process that requires remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton through the action of the small GTPase Rac . CrkII and DOCK180 were found to accumulate at the phagocytic cup . Using Crk mutants and Crk siRNA , it was proposed that CrkII is required for DOCK180 recruitment , Rac activation , and pathogen engulfment [ 62 ] . The possible roles of Crk proteins in several human malignancies have remained elusive because studies have failed to correlate Crk expression levels with cancer progression [ 63 – 65 ] . There are several excellent reviews on the signaling of Crk proteins [ 9 , 66 ] . 10 . Crk and Bacterial Invasion Numerous reports indicate that Crk may contribute to bac - terial pathogenesis in a variety of ways , including helping bacteria to enter host cells or serving as “targets of bacterial toxins that disrupt essential cellular functions” [ 9 ] . On one side , Crk adaptors have been implicated in lamellipodia and ruffle formation , in part because of their action over FAs [ 67 ] and , on the other side , in phagocytosis by immune cells [ 62 ] . It makes sense to think that intracellular pathogens would benefit by stimulating their invasion by promoting the first process , while they would benefit by inhibiting the second process to avoid their destruction by phagocytic immune cells . Thus , a common theme in bacterial invasion of nonphagocytic epithelial cells is the induction of ruffles at the site of bacterial attachment . The accumulation of bacteria along with the remodeled cytoskeleton at the site of entrance is very frequently referred as “foci . ” This mechanism of entrance is called “the triggering mechanism” [ 68 ] , in which we will focus with respect to Crk adaptors , as it is employed by various Enterobacteriaceae members ( e . g . , Salmonella and Shigella ) . On the contrary , Yersinia uses “the zipper mechanism . ” 10 . 1 . Salmonella . Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium targets intestinal epithelial cells that are normally nonphago - cytic . Despite this , Salmonella is able to induce its phagocytic uptake after bacterial attachment to the intestinal epithelium [ 69 ] . Invasion is mediated by a type III secretion system ( T3SS ) that injects bacterial effector proteins directly into the host cytosol [ 70 ] . Salmonella T3SS effectors directly target and manipulate host signaling pathways involved in actin filament assembly and cytoskeletal rearrangement leading to bacterial entry [ 71 , 72 ] . Salmonella invasion utilizes several pathways that converge on Crk : on one side the bacteria manipulate the Fak - p130Cas - Crk axis and on the other side the Abl / Arg - Crk signaling pathway . To stimulate phagocytic uptake by host cells , Salmonella induces the assembly of FA - like complexes that lack inte - grins but require the recruitment of FAK and p130Cas [ 73 ] . FAK appears to act as a structural scaffold , as its kinase domain is not required . However , its C - terminal proline - rich motif , through which it interacts with p130Cas , is required . In addition , the p130Cas - CrkII interaction appears to be functionally important for Salmonella - induced cytoskeletal rearrangement . Thus , p130Cas − / − cells complemented with p130Cas lacking the Crk - binding domain were impaired for invasion as compared with p130Cas + / + cells . These data suggest that FAK , p130Cas , and Crk work in concert to regulate Salmonella invasion [ 73 ] . Another important strategy used by Salmonella is the manipulation of Abl kinases to promote lamellipodia for - mation through activation of the WASP family verpro - lin homologous protein ( WAVE ) complex [ 74 ] , also called WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) . WAVE proteins are actin - nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) that activate the Arp2 / 3 complex mainly at sites of lamellipodia formation ( reviewed in [ 75 ] ) . Their regulatory mechanism is controversial , but it seems that activation of the WAVE2 complex requires simultaneous interactions with prenylated Rac - GTP and acidic phospholipids , as well as a specific phosphorylation [ 76 , 77 ] . The role of Abl / Arg kinases and Crk phosphorylation has been studied by Casanova’s group [ 19 ] . Abl is recruited to the site of bacterial invasion ( reviewed in [ 72 ] ) . In MEFs either lacking Abl / Arg , or HeLa and MDCK cells treated with an Abl inhibitor ( Imatinib ) , bacterial invasion efficiency was greatly reduced , as compared with untreated cells . It was proposed that the adaptor protein CrkII associates with Abl during infection , as evidenced by the presence of CrkII at the site of active Salmonella internalization where it colocalized with F - actin . Salmonella infection led to increased phosphorylation of CrkII , while CrkII phosphory - lation deficient variants block Salmonella entry . Furthermore , Salmonella infection led to increased phosphorylation of the Abelson - interacting protein ( Abi1 ) [ 19 ] , a component of the WAVE2 complex . Interestingly , it has been proposed that Crk competes with Abi1 for binding to activated Abl , through interaction of their SH3 domain with the PRR in the kinase [ 45 ] . Thus , it is clear that both the Fak - p130Cas - Crk and Abl / Arg - Crk pathways make important contributions to Salmonella invasion . Because these pathways have largely been studied independently of each other , it will be interesting to determine if they are indeed interconnected . 6 BioMed Research International 10 . 2 . Shigella . Like Salmonella , Shigella flexneri enters intesti - nal epithelial cells , which are not inherently phagocytic , and causes bacillary dysentery in humans . Shigella T3SS effectors interact with host proteins to induce dramatic rearrangements of the host actin cytoskeleton to form actin - rich extensions , similar to lamellipodia , which engulf the bacterium [ 78 , 79 ] . However , in contrast to Salmonella , which replicates and survives inside a special compartment ( the Salmonella - containing vacuole ) , Shigella remains in the cell cytoplasm [ 80 ] . Thus , although their invasion shares key components , including Crk , distinct host proteins seem to be used by these pathogens ( e . g . , cortactin ) . Shigella stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of some host cell proteins , including Crk adaptors . Abl - and Arg - deficient MEFs have a dramatic decrease in intracellular bacteria after Shigella infection , as compared with WT cells . Similar to Salmonella infection , treating cells with Imatinib ( which was developed to inhibit the kinase activity of the BCR - Abl fusion protein in Philadelphia - positive CMLs ) reduced Shigella invasion compared with untreated cells , indicating that efficient Shigella infection requires Abl and Arg kinase activity [ 81 ] . It was reported that Shigella uptake promotes phosphorylation of Crk , indicating that the Abl - Crk module participates in Shigella invasion of host cells . In addition , a Crk - phosphorylation deficient mutant ( CrkII - Y221F ) showed a significant decrease in Rac and Cdc42 activation suggesting that the activation of these GTPases is at least in part mediated by Crk phosphorylation [ 81 ] . Cortactin , a type II NPF that activates the actin related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex and regulates the neural Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) activity [ 82 ] , is recruited to the site of Shigella entry and is tyrosine - phosphorylated in a Src kinase - dependent manner [ 83 ] . Bougn ` eres et al . reported that , during Shigella invasion , Src phosphorylates cortactin and then phosphocortactin localizes to the site of Shigella invasion . Furthermore , it was proposed that phosphocortactin association with Crk promotes Shigella entry [ 84 ] . Contrary to Shigella , cortactin expression downregulation by RNA interference does not inhibit Salmonella invasion , although the protein is recruited to the sites where the bacteria invade [ 85 ] . Unc119 was initially identified as an adaptor protein that activates specific SFK members , such as Lyn [ 86 ] . Interest - ingly , Unc119 blocks Shigella invasion by inhibiting Abl / Arg tyrosine kinases , which results in Crk phosphorylation down - regulation [ 87 ] . While for Salmonella , the WAVE complex has been well studied , relatively little data are available for Shigella , while the opposite is true for cortactin . Therefore , potential future studies could examine the roles of these respective proteins to determine if they are indeed important to Shigella and Salmonella invasion , respectively . 10 . 3 . Yersinia . Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Y . enterocol - itica are enteric pathogens that cause infections which are usually self - limiting , in contrast to Y . pestis , the causative agent of bubonic plague ( reviewed in [ 88 ] ) . Yersinia species deliver virulence proteins ( Yop effectors ) directly into the host cell via the T3SS [ 89 ] . Yersinia spp . utilize a 𝛽 1 - integrin - mediated zippering mechanism for bacterial uptake in an actin - dependent process . Uptake is mediated by the inter - action between invasin , a bacterial transmembrane protein , and 𝛽 1 - integrins on the host cell surface . The invasin - integrin association initiates a signaling cascade , characterized by tyrosine phosphorylation , leading to activation of the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 , possibly to promote the activation of N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 90 ] for the formation of actin projections enabling bacterial invasion . Crk - p130Cas signaling was implicated in Y . pseudotu - berculosis uptake [ 91 ] . Overexpression of Crk containing mutations ( R38V , W169L ) to block Crk - SH2 or Crk - SH3 domain binding to target proteins decreased bacterial uptake , indicating that Crk is important for Yersinia invasion of epithelial cells . Furthermore , p130Cas - Crk complex forma - tion was induced in response to infection , which was coupled to Rac1 activation . However , the existence of a Fak - dependent and p130Cas - Crk independent pathway for Yersinia uptake has also been proposed [ 92 ] . In contrast to invasin , which binds directly to 𝛽 1 - integrin receptors with high affinity , YadA is a Y . pseudo - tuberculosis outer membrane adhesin that binds integrins indirectly through the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . Hudson et al . characterized the mechanisms by which invasin and YadA promote adherence and phagocytic signaling events in macrophages and studied how ECM proteins differ - entially influence their ability to bind integrins . At low ECM concentrations , invasin binds directly and with high - affinity to 𝛽 1 - integrin to induce integrin clustering and to stimulate integrin - dependent phagocytosis , through FAK - p130Cas - Rac1 signaling . However , at high ECM concentra - tions , indirect YadA binding to 𝛽 1 - integrin predominates , which also promotes adherence to and entry into host cells [ 93 ] . Together , these data suggest that the host cell response to Yersinia infection is likely influenced not only by the expression levels of invasin and YadA during infection , but also by the extracellular environment at the infection site . It is noteworthy that Crk is implicated in the triggering mechanism for Salmonella and Shigella , and in the zipper mechanism of invasion for Yersinia . This may not be surpris - ing because Crk is implicated in cytoskeletal remodeling via Rac GTPase and possibly WAVE regulation , whereas it is also involved in FA remodeling through integrin signaling . 11 . EPEC Enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli ( EPEC and EHEC , resp . ) adhere to intestinal epithelial cells and deliver proteins into the host via the T3SS , resulting in microvilli effacement and intimate attachment to cells , forming the so - called attaching and effacing ( A / E ) lesions . Because most of the data obtained to date regarding Crk signaling has been from studies of EPEC , rather than EHEC , we will primarily focus on EPEC in this review . It will be interesting in the future to determine to what extent these data are translatable to EHEC . BioMed Research International 7 Among the effector proteins delivered is the translocated intimin receptor ( Tir ) , which is inserted into the host cell plasma membrane where it binds intimin , located on the outer membrane of EPEC [ 94 ] . The Tir - intimin interaction activates signaling events that are required for A / E lesion formation . The accumulation of a dense material identified as actin was noticed in early studies . The resulting actin - rich structure is now referred to as a pedestal ( reviewed in [ 95 ] ) . EPEC Tir is phosphorylated on residue Y474 [ 96 ] redun - dantly by Abl / Arg [ 97 ] and SFK tyrosine kinases [ 98 ] , which is essential for actin polymerization and pedestal formation [ 96 ] . Besides tyrosine phosphorylation , Tir is phosphorylated on serine residues ( S434 and S463 ) . This phosphorylation has been correlated to increases in apparent molecular mass and efficient pedestal formation [ 99 ] . It is thought that these shifts in apparent molecular mass indicate changes in Tir structure that enable tyrosine phosphorylation and / or promote Tir insertion into the plasma membrane [ 99 , 100 ] . Phosphorylated Y474 , within the C - terminal cytoplasmic domain of Tir , recruits the host cell adaptor proteins non - catalytic tyrosine kinase ( Nck ) 1 and 2 ( collectively referred to as Nck ) . Nck in turns recruits N - WASP [ 101 ] , an NPF member of the WAS family of proteins that promote actin polymerization by activating the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 102 , 103 ] . N - WASP presents a closed inactive conformation mainly due to intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions that involve the C - terminal acidic domain and the GTPase - binding domain ( GBD ) . N - WASP requires the interaction with other pro - teins through its GBD or proline - rich domain ( PRD ) and possibly posttranslational modifications to be fully active [ 75 ] . The current paradigm establishes that the major pathway to actin polymerization in typical EPEC infections takes place through phosphorylation of Tir Y474 , and subsequent formation of a Tir - Nck - N - WASP complex to promote actin polymerization by the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 104 ] . This proposed signaling pathway has been based mainly on studies using Nck - deficient MEFs , thus their low efficiency in pedestal formation was presumed to reflect a lack of N - WASP acti - vation [ 101 , 105 – 107 ] . It is also generally accepted that phos - phorylated Tir Y454 promotes a secondary Nck - independent pathway for actin nucleation [ 107 ] . However , infection studies with human intestinal tissue using an EPEC Tir Y454F , Y474F variant also lead to actin nucleation and pedestal formation [ 108 ] . Likewise , A / E lesion formation and N - WASP recruitment was unaltered when the equivalent Tir variant from Citrobacter rodentium ( Tir CR Y471 and Y451 ) was used [ 109 ] . These in vitro versus in vivo contradictory results might be explained at least in part by our recent unexpected findings indicating that Nck adaptors possibly have a subsidiary function in activating N - WASP during pedestal formation by EPEC ( Nieto - Pelegrin et al , Cell Adhesion and Migration , In press ) . We found decreased levels of translocated Tir within Nck1 / 2 - deficient MEFs that were corroborated in HeLa cells with down - regulated expression of Nck by siRNA . 12 . EPEC Manipulation of Focal Adhesion Proteins In the early 1960s it was reported that EPEC induces epithelial cell shedding in the intestine [ 110 ] which may contribute to diarrhea . This effect was later reproduced in studies with cell lines , including epithelial cells ( HeLa , Caco - 2 ) and fibroblasts ( DU17 ; [ 111 ] ) . It was observed that EPEC induces cell detachment from the substratum of the infected host cells mainly by modifying FAs , which were reduced in number and redistributed to the cell periphery . Furthermore , this T3SS dependent - detachment was correlated with FAK dephospho - rylation and thus , in FAK − / − fibroblasts , detachment could not be detected [ 111 ] . However , the molecular mechanism underlying cell detachment induced by EPEC remained elusive , until it was recently found that the non - LEE - encoded EspC , a serine protease injected by EPEC , is responsible for FAK dephosphorylation and its subsequent degradation , as well as for the degradation of other FA proteins such as paxillin [ 21 ] . Related to that , an increase in FAK dephosphorylation by the Shigella late T3SS effector OspE has been reported [ 112 ] . OspE interacts with integrin - linked kinase ( ILK ) and blocks focal adhesion disassembly . ILK is a central adaptor ( a pseudokinase ) recruited to 𝛽 1 - integrin tails in FAs that mediates the communication between cells and the ECM . Future work will undoubtedly address whether the anticell lifting effect mediated by OspE binding to ILK , demonstrated for Shigella , applies to the OspE orthologs found in EPEC , EHEC , and Salmonella [ 113 , 114 ] . As for EHEC , the EspO1 - 2 effectors are homologous to Shigella OspE , and through EspM , seem to regulate RhoA GTPase activity to stabilize FAs [ 115 ] . Since Crk adaptors participate in FAs signaling , future studies should aim to address their role in FAs manipulation by these pathogens . Using immunofluorescence staining , Goosney et al . local - ized other FA components besides FAK , including p130Cas , vinculin , and CrkII [ 116 ] . CrkII localization within pedestals was shown to be dependent on the phosphorylation of Y474 of Tir , although it should be noted that the Y474F variant induces a very limited number of pedestals . In addition , Crk proteins interact with N - WASP via SH3 - PRR interactions in smooth muscle cells [ 117 ] . However , it still remains unknown whether Crk - N - WASP interaction would activate the latter to promote Arp2 / 3 complex dependent actin polymerization . These and other unanswered questions prompted us to investigate the role of Crk adaptors in pedestal formation by EPEC [ 20 ] . Unexpectedly , we found that Crk isoforms act as redundant inhibitors of pedestal formation . Thus , Crk expression downregulation by siRNA in HeLa cells or the absence of individual Crk isoforms within CrkI / II or CrkL K . O . MEFs did not alter the number of pedestals formed in infected cells . On the contrary , inhibition of the three Crk isoforms in HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in pedestal number . Similar results were found in CrkI / II or CrkL K . O . MEFs with knock - down expression by siRNA of the remaining isoform . Moreover , we found that Crk SH2 domain binds Tir through Y474 and competes with the 8 BioMed Research International binding of the Nck SH2 domain to Tir , thus inhibiting its recruitment and subsequently , N - WASP activation . In view of our findings , we proposed that Crk adaptors might inhibit actin polymerization at pedestals by competing with Nck activation of N - WASP [ 20 ] . 13 . Do Crk Adaptors Have a Role in Innate Immunity Signaling Manipulation by EPEC ? Several EPEC and EHEC T3SS effectors have been found to inhibit the innate immune response of intestinal epithelial cells by altering the activity of various components of the proinflammatory NF - 𝜅 B signaling pathway . This is the case for Tir , whose interaction in the cytoplasm with the TNF - alpha receptor - associated factor ( TRAF ) adaptor proteins induces their degradation by , at the moment , an undefined mechanism [ 118 ] . EPEC Tir contains ITIM motifs that inter - act with SHP - 1 , a host tyrosine phosphatase , implicated in immune downregulation . Tir binding to SHP - 1 was found to promote the association of SHP - 1 with TRAF6 and inhibit TRAF6 ubiquitination , thus altering immune signaling [ 119 ] . While Tir is known to bind Crk [ 20 ] , this interaction is not necessarily implicated in the phenotypes described above , and awaits further experimentation . Several years ago it was discovered that the ribosomal protein S3 ( RPS3 ) interacts with the p65 subunit of NF - 𝜅 B in the nucleus to increase the affinity of the NF - 𝜅 B complex for a subset of gene promoters [ 120 ] . The non - LEE - encoded effector NleH1 inhibits I 𝜅 B - kinase - 𝛽 ( IKK 𝛽 ) phosphorylation of RPS3 S209 , preventing RPS3 nuclear translocation [ 121 ] and thus reducing NF - 𝜅 B activity in infected cells [ 122 ] . Wan et al . reported that the Ser / Thr kinase activity of NleH1 is essential to inhibit NF - 𝜅 B activation , yet neither RPS3 nor IKK 𝛽 appeared to be the target for NleH1 kinase activity [ 121 ] . Using an in vitro kinase array , CrkL was identified as an NleH1 kinase substrate and was also found to interact with IKK 𝛽 [ 22 ] . Downregulation of CrkL expression using siRNA prevented NleH1 inhibition of NF - 𝜅 B activity , suggesting that CrkL may act as an adaptor protein , possibly by recruiting NleH1 to the IKK 𝛽 - RPS3 complex to prevent RPS3 phosphorylation and subsequently inhibit NF - 𝜅 B activation [ 22 ] . It is currently unknown if this adaptor function in innate immunity applies only to CrkL or might also involve CrkII , as these proteins often have redundant functions . It is also unknown if CrkII / CrkL activities might influence the action of other EPEC / EHEC effectors with anti - inflammatory functions . 14 . Crk Adaptors as Possible Targets in the Treatment of Enterobacteriaceae Infections Fortunately , there is a lot of active research in the area of pharmacological inhibition of Crk , due to the oncogenic role of Bcr - Abl fusion - protein in CML . Microbiologists could exploit much of this work for future research . As men - tioned above , the Abl inhibitor imatinib significantly reduced Salmonella and Shigella infection of cells , an observation that appears promising regarding its potential use in animal models . Evolving knowledge on microRNAs ( such as miR - 126 , [ 123 ] ) could be taken into consideration as a possible way to prevent infection of Salmonella , Shigella , and Yersinia . On the contrary , according to in vitro studies [ 97 ] , chem - ical inhibition of Abl / Arg might be expected to fail in the case of preventing EPEC infection . However , the discrepancies found between the different in vitro and in vivo models , as previously mentioned , will dictate careful reassessment . The subject gets even more complicated because , as discussed above , on one side , CrkII and CrkL block Tir signaling to achieve pedestal formation , which could be explained by the recent finding that Crk adaptors function in a heterocomplex , as reported to occur during podocyte morphogenesis [ 124 ] . Therefore , concomitant inhibition of CrkII and CrkL might result in an increase in pedestal formation , which would seem to favor bacterial adhesion . However , individual CrkL expression downregulation was sufficient to block NleH1 - mediated inhibition of NF - 𝜅 B , which could imply a different mechanism of action and a direct role of Crk adaptors in promoting innate immune responses . Clearly , more research is needed to gain further insight into how Crk adaptors par - ticipate in the host response to Enterobacteriaceae infections . 15 . Concluding Remarks Much has been learned about the role of Crk adaptors in host - pathogen interactions ( Figure 3 ) . However many unanswered questions regarding their signaling pathways remain open to investigation , especially with regard to a detailed dissection of the molecular complexes that are formed . In addition , some of the pathways in which Crk adaptors have been implicated are still incomplete and disconnected . There is little doubt that future work should address some challenging matters of pathogen manipulation of cellular signaling . One of those key aspects is the temporal regulation of signaling . The picture gets complicated by the apparent redundancy in effector targets ( i . e . , the same cellular proteins can be targeted by different bacterial effectors ) , even more so when these targets are functionally pleiotropic proteins such as Crk adaptors . In our opinion , although Crk adaptors have been traditionally involved in the entrance of pathogens , thanks to recent studies , it seems that they will also be further implicated in innate signaling .

( a ) Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium manipulates Abl kinase phosphorylation of Crk adaptors to gain entry into the host cell . S . Typhimurium activates Abl kinase via T3SS effectors . Abl phosphorylates CrkII regulatory tyrosines . FAK and p130Cas are recruited to the FA - like complex where p130Cas interacts with CrkII , leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement and uptake of the bacterium . Abl activation by Salmonella effectors may also result in WAVE2 complex activation , in part through phosphorylation of Abi1 . The WAVE2 complex is necessary for activation of Arp2 / 3 to induce actin polymerization at the site of lamellipodia formation . WAVE2 activation also requires interaction with Rho - GTPases ( e . g . , Rac ) . Salmonella effectors may also directly activate Rho - GTPases . It is unclear whether crosstalk between the two pathways exists ( adapted from [ 19 ] ) . ( b ) Shigella T3SS effectors activate Abl / Arg to phosphorylate Crk adaptors . Abl / Arg phosphorylates and activates CrkII , which regulates the activity of Rho - GTPases ( e . g . , Rac and Cdc42 ) . Cortactin is phosphorylated by Src and phosphocortactin interacts with CrkII . Cortactin can contribute to activation of N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex , resulting in actin polymerization and membrane ruffling . Rho - GTPases can also activate Arp2 / 3 and N - WASP . On the contrary , Unc119 blocks Abl / Arg phosphorylation of Crk . ( c ) Yersinia uptake is mediated by 𝛽 1 - integrin signaling to Crk adaptors . The p130Cas - Crk interaction is promoted during Yersinia invasion . FAK and Src are also recruited to this complex . The p130Cas - Crk complex formation is coupled to Rho - GTPase ( e . g . , Rac ) activation , leading to activation of N - WASP , actin polymerization , and bacterial entrance . Alternatively , Yersinia YadAcanbindtohostcellintegrinindirectlythroughECMproteins ( e . g . , fibronectin ) . Thisactivatesasignalingcascade involving FAK , p130Cas and Rho - GTPases , which ultimately lead to actin remodeling and Yersinia uptake . At low ECM concentrations , the invasin - integrin model predominates . At high ECM concentrations , the YadA - ECM - integrin model predominates . Yersinia likely uses a combination of invasin and YadA binding to gain entry into the cell . ( d ) Crk adaptor proteins are targeted by several EPEC effectors during infection . Tir is inserted into the host cell membrane where binds intimin on the bacterial surface , resulting in intimate attachment of E . coli to the host cell . Abl / Arg and Src family kinases ( SFKs ) phosphorylate Tir ( “Tir insertion” ) , resulting in the recruitment of Nck . Nck recruits and activates N - WASP leading to Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymerization and pedestal formation . Abl / Arg phosphorylates CrII / CrkL ( “initiation of pedestal formation” ; see [ 20 ] for details ) . Tir levels are reduced in the absence of Nck ( dashed circle ; Nieto - Pelegrin et al , in press ) . Other FA components localize to pedestals ( e . g . , FAK , p130Cas , vinculin , and paxillin ; “Actin polymerization / Pedestal formation” ) , though some are degraded by the EspC effector ( dashed lines ; [ 21 ] ) . During infection , the transcriptional regulator , NF - 𝜅 B , becomes activated and translocates to the nucleus . In addition , RPS3 is phosphorylated by IKK 𝛽 and translocates to the nucleus via importin - 𝛼 , where RPS3 acts as a “specifier” for NF - 𝜅 B to select for and regulate a specific subset of innate immune response genes . The effector NleH1 interacts with CrkL and subsequently prevents the phosphorylation of RPS3 , thus blocking RPS3 nuclear translocation and inhibiting NF - 𝜅 B activation and the innate immune response . In the absence of CrkL ( dashed lines ) , NleH1 cannot block RPS3 translocation to the nucleus . Model partially adapted from [ 22 ] . Other translocated effectors include mitochondrial associated protein ( Map ) and EPEC - secreted proteins ( Esp ) H , F , G , and Z [ 23 ] that are encoded within a pathogenicity island termed the locus of enterocyte effacement ( LEE ) [ 24 ] .
