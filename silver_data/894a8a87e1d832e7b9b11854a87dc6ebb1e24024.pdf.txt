A Collaborative Brain - Computer Interface ( BCI ) Yueqing Li Department of Industrial Engineering Lamar University Outlines  Introduction  Methods  Results  Discussion  Conclusions 2 Introduction • What is BCI ?  BCI is a new system that allows users to communicate with the external world or control external equipment without using normal pathways of peripheral nerves and muscles ( Wolpaw et al . , 2002 )  It is an alternative communication medium for people with severe motor disabilities and for able - bodied people ( Wolpaw et al . , 2000 ) .  SSVEP : Steady - state visual evoked potential  Advantage of SSVEP  No initial training is needed  SSVEP - based BCI offers higher ITR 3 Introduction • Example of SSVEP ?  SSVEP evoked by a visual stimulus of 7 . 5 Hz with 2nd and 3rd harmonics 4 Fundamental Frequency 2 nd harmonic 3 rd harmonic Introduction • SSVEP - Based BCI 5 • Research Goal – To evaluate effect of collaboration mode and motor disability on task performance Method • Participants  10 ALS patients , 10 age - matched able - bodied participants • Apparatus  Amplifier , EEG cap , LED lights , Robots 6 Method • Independent Variables  Collaboration Mode  Individual vs . simultaneous  Motor Disability  ALS group vs . able - bodied group • Dependent Variables  Accuracy ( % )  Information Transfer Rate ( bits / min )  Completion Time ( Sec ) 7 Method • Experimental Task  Perform the sequence of movement : G  St3  R  G  St1  R  Grab at Station 2  Move to Station 3  Release at Station 3  Grab at Station 3  Move to Station 1  Release at Station 1 8 • Balanced 2 X 2 mixed design  4 trials with 2 trials in each condition Results  Accuracy ( % )  Significant effect of collaboration mode ( F 1 , 8 = 51 . 12 , p < 0 . 0001 )  Individual ( M = 0 . 644 ) < Simultaneous ( M = 0 . 841 )  No main effect of motor disability ( F 1 , 8 = 0 . 03 , p = 0 . 8680 ) 9 0 . 746 0 . 739 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 Motor Disability A cc u r acy No Yes 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 Collaboration Mode A cc u r acy Individual Simultaneous Results  ITR ( bits / min )  Significant effect of collaboration mode ( F 1 , 8 = 42 . 59 , p = 0 . 0002 )  Individual ( M = 0 . 69 ) < Simultaneous ( M = 2 . 54 )  No main effect of motor disability ( F 1 , 8 = 1 . 13 , p = 0 . 3180 ) 10 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 3 . 5 4 Collaboration Mode I T R Individual Simultaneous 1 . 811 1 . 419 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 3 . 5 4 Motor Disability I T R No Yes Results  Completion Time ( Sec )  Significant effect of collaboration mode ( F 1 , 8 = 77 . 66 , p < 0 . 0001 )  Individual ( M = 53 . 4 ) > Simultaneous ( M = 33 . 7 )  No main effect of motor disability ( F 1 , 8 = 2 . 08 , p = 0 . 1868 ) 11 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Collaboration Mode C o m p l e t i on T I m e Individual Simultaneous 40 . 669 46 . 419 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Motor Disability C o m p l e t i on T I m e No Yes Discussion • Effect of Collaboration Mode  Significant effect on task performance ( completion time , accuracy and ITR ) :  Significantly better performance in simultaneous mode than individual mode  The result confirms previous research ( Wang & Jung , 2011 ; Eckstein et al . , 2012 ) .  Simultaneous mode is more efficient because of the error cancellation property of team work ( Baron , Kerr , & Miller , 2012 ; Brown , 2000 ) .  The presence of teammates elevated individual performance ( Aiello & Douthitt , 2001 ) . 12 Discussion • Effect of Motor Disability  No significant effect on task performance .  Different from Li et al . ( 2011 ) and Li et al . ( 2014 ) , Sellers & Donchin ( 2006 ) . Same as Volosyak et al . ( 2009 ) on ITR .  It showed that ALS patients can use BCI as efficient as able - bodied people .  Impact of fatigue may appear if task is much more complex .  However , the layout of the visual stimuli should be further investigated for ALS patients when there are more visual stimuli . 13 Conclusions  Both groups can finish the robot control task within time limit with satisfactory accuracy .  Collaborative modes were more efficient than individual mode .  Pioneered the design and evaluation of collaborative BCI .  Demonstrated that people with motor disabilities could use collaborative BCI as efficient as able - bodied people ,  It proves the potential of BCI to help those with severe motor disabilities . 14 15
