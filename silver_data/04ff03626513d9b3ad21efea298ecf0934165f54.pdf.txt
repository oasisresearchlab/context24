304 NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY VOL 18 MARCH 2000 http : / / biotech . nature . com RESEARCH ARTICLES Chemical libraries can be screened for small molecules that affect a variety of cellular processes including signal transduction , the cell cycle , and cellular metabolism . In particular , it may be possible to identify molecules that induce cells to differentiate into specific cell types , or conversely , molecules that reverse differentiation or induce regenerative processes . The latter might result from either blockage of pathways that maintain the differentiated phenotype , or the induction of biochemical pathways active during development or wound healing . Molecules that affect the differentiated phenotype may ultimately find use in cellular replacement therapy or tissue engineering and regeneration . Myocytes can be used to investigate the effects of small molecules on differentiated cells . A hallmark of skeletal muscle cell differentia - tion is the fusion of mononucleated myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes . In order to form myotubes , myoblasts must stop dividing . In the process , cells express muscle - specific transcription factors like MyoD , Myf 5 , MEF2 , and myogenin , and downregulate expression of cell cycle - regulatory proteins such as cyclin A 1 – 4 . These changes lead to the expression of characteristic markers such as skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain ( SMMHC ) and the acetylcholine receptor ( AChR ) . Eventually , myotubes acquire sarcomeric actomyosin orga - nization , become contractile , and form neuromuscular junctions . During limb regeneration in amphibians , multinucleated myotubes disassemble into mononucleated fragments that grow and divide as individual cells 5 , 6 . This indicates that muscle regeneration through myotube disassembly is possible , at least in some verte - brates . To explore the possibility of inducing similar processes in mammalian cells 7 , 8 , a library of 2 , 6 , 9 - trisubstituted purines 9 was screened for molecules that disassemble myotubes using a mouse cell line that differentiates in vitro 10 . One member of the library pro - moted the fission of multinucleated myotubes into individual cells—hence its name , myoseverin ( Fig . 1A ) . Results and discussion Myoseverin was identified by screening a purine library , with murine C2C12 muscle cells that had been induced to form myotubes . Addition of myoseverin resulted in a change in cell morphology that was visible by phase contrast microscopy . The long , cylindrical myotubes disap - peared and were replaced by chains of smaller , rounded cells that remained attached to the culture dish ( Fig . 1B ) . Constrictions were apparent throughout the length of any remaining myotubes , giving them a beads - on - a - string appearance . Staining the differentiated myotubes with anti - SMMHC antibodies made visible cytoplasmic bridges joining fragments containing a single nucleus and undergoing fission ( Fig . 1C , D ) . The degree of fragmentation into mononucleated cells varied with culture conditions but was most efficient when nuclei were aligned as single columns running the length of the myotubes ( Fig . 1C , D ) . Nevertheless , myotube fragmentation was consistently observed in the presence of myoseverin , even in myotubes with a less organized architecture . In dose / response and time course experiments , the half - maximal concentration of myoseverin required to disassemble myotubes in 24 h was 11 m M ( s . d . = – 4 m M , n = 8 ) . The cytoskeletal organization of cells treated with myoseverin provided insight into its mechanism of action . Actin staining with rhodamine - phalloidin did not reveal an obvious difference in the spatial organization of microfilaments in the presence of myoseverin ( data not shown ) . On the other hand , immunofluorescent visualiza - tion of tubulin in extracted cells 11 revealed that myoseverin disinte - grates the microtubule cytoskeleton ( Fig . 2A – D ) . Microtubules nor - mally form parallel bundles aligned with the long axis of the cell ( Fig 2A , C ) , but tubulin polymers in myoseverin - treated myotubes aggregate around individual nuclei ( Fig . 2B , D ) . Short , fragmented microtubules fill the cytoplasm between the nuclei . Generally , cells constrict in regions that appear relatively free of microtubules . Affinity - labeling experiments with a biotinylated myoseverin derivative ( Fig . 3A ) provided additional evidence that the compound interacts with tubulin . Cells were incubated with the affinity label ( 10 m M ) in the presence or absence of 100 m M myoseverin . After labeling , biotinylated proteins were isolated from cytoplasmic extracts using streptavidin - coated magnetic beads . The presence of tubulin on the beads was determined by immunoblotting with the highly specific E7 monoclonal antibody . Only one band was detected in the blots . More tubulin was bound to beads incubated with extracts from cells treated Myoseverin , a microtubule - binding molecule with novel cellular effects Gustavo R .

Received 26 October 1999 ; accepted 7 January 2000 A new microtubule - binding molecule , myoseverin , was identified from a library of 2 , 6 , 9 - trisubstituted purines in a morphological differentiation screen . Myoseverin induces the reversible fission of multinu - cleated myotubes into mononucleated fragments . Myotube fission promotes DNA synthesis and cell pro - liferation after removal of the compound and transfer of the cells to fresh growth medium . Transcriptional profiling and biochemical analysis indicate that myoseverin alone does not reverse the biochemical dif - ferentiation process .

Myoseverin , and other related compounds , inhibited the polymer - ization of purified bovine tubulin in vitro . A series of derivatives were synthesized to probe the structure / activity relationship of myoseverin . Both microtubule depolymerization activity and myotube disassem - bly were dependent on the presence of methoxy groups at the para position of both benzyl rings . Whereas methylation at the N6 position abolished activity , some substitutions at the N9 position were active in the microtubule polymerization assay ( isopropyl ( myoseverin ) > ethyl > methyl ) . Amino derivatives with two - to four - carbon linkers at the N9 position had no activity , whereas derivatives with longer linkers retained activity , although they were less effective at inducing myotube fragmentation . In histone H1 phosphorylation assays , myo - severin did not inhibit CDK1 activity 9 , indicating a mechanism of action different from other bioactive 2 , 6 , 9 - trisubstituted purines . Treatment of differentiated myotubes with nocodazole , colchicine , vinblastine , or taxol induces myotube disassembly , consistent with a role for microtubules in the mechanism of myoseverin action . At active concentrations ( 1 – 10 m M ) , inhibitors of microtubule polymer - ization induce retraction of myotubes and formation of myosacs , a type of deformed , multinucleated cell 12 , 13 . In contrast , myoseverin and taxol promote circumferential contraction and fission at discrete sites throughout the length of the cell . Whereas the effects of myoseverin are reversible , however , long , cylindrical myotubes did not re - form after treatment with vinblastine or taxol , followed by removal of the drugs and addition of differentiation medium ( DM ; see Experimental protocol ) ( data not shown ) . Interestingly , myotube fission by myosev - erin resulted in the formation of viable , nonapoptotic fragments as revealed by MTT reduction , trypan blue exclusion , and TUNEL assays ( see Experimental protocol ) . As with myoseverin , myotube disassem - bly with nocodazole and colchicine was reversible . However , in cell growth assays , myoseverin ( GI 50 = 1 . 2 · 10 - 5 M ) was significantly less harmful to proliferating myoblasts than nocodazole ( GI 50 = 2 · 10 - 8 M ) , colchicine ( GI 50 = 1 · 10 - 8 M ) , taxol ( GI 50 = 1 · 10 - 9 M ) , or vinblas - tine ( GI 50 = 1 . 5 · 10 - 9 M ) . Next , we determined whether myotube fission with myoseverin would promote cell proliferation . Remarkably , myoseverin treatment ( 20 m M ) promoted DNA synthesis ( determined by BrdU incorpora - tion ) by more than fourfold relative to untreated cells after removal of the drug from differentiated cell populations and incubation in growth medium ( GM ) ( Fig . 4A ) . Myoseverin alone did not promote cell proliferation since fragmented myotube cultures incubated in DM failed to incorporate BrdU beyond the level of untreated , differentiat - ed cells ( Fig . 4A ) . In colony - forming assays , myoseverin also facilitated cell cycle reentry , increasing the number of colony - forming units in differentiated cell populations by more than twofold ( Fig . 4B ) . To test whether myoseverin acts specifically on differentiated cells , AChRs on the surface of myotubes were labeled with fluorescein - bun - garotoxin , a fluorescent AChR antagonist , so that cells could be sorted . As determined by FACS analysis , AChR - expressing cells were present only in differentiated cultures ( Fig . 4D , G ) . AChR expression was independent of treatment ( Fig . 4D , G ) , although the effect of the myo - severin on cell size and shape was evident in side scatter / forward scat - ter plots ( Fig . 4E , H ) . In colony - forming assays , myoseverin increased the fraction of colony - forming units derived from the sorted , AChR - positive cells by an average of 2 . 25 - fold ( s . e . m . = – 0 . 61 ; n = 13 ) . To further investigate the biological mechanism of myoseverin action , we compared mRNA levels for more than 6 , 000 different genes in differentiated myocyte populations treated with 20 m M myoseverin , Figure 1 .

The transcriptional profiles indicate that myoseverin does not induce detectable changes in most cell cycle - and muscle - spe - cific transcripts . Muscle - specific transcription factors MyoD , Myf6 , myogenin , and MEF2C are among the genes not affected by myosev - erin treatment , whereas Myf5 mRNA levels actually increase . With few exceptions , genes involved in metabolism , macromolecular synthesis , and ion homeostasis also remained unaffected by myoseverin . Instead , more than half of the transcripts specifically affected by myoseverin correspond to genes involved in a cellular response to tis - sue injury . Out of 93 genes significantly affected by the compound , eight are involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and nine are growth factors ( Table 1 ) . A variety of growth factor - inducible tran - scripts are also affected , including transcriptional regulators , proteins involved in signal transduction , and a growth factor receptor ( FGF4R ) with known morphogenetic roles 14 . Myoseverin also affect - ed the expression of a variety of cytoskeletal genes ( most of them downregulated ) , including b - tubulin , plakoglobin , M - caveolin , schwannomin , and myosin IC , while increasing the expression levels of genes regulating protein turnover such as ubiquitin - conjugating protein E2 and translation elongation factor E2 . Myoseverin induced changes in the expression levels of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling , inflammation , coagula - tion , signal transduction , and cell communication such as those observed in the wounding response of fibroblasts 15 . For example , expression of MARC and SDF - 1 - b , complement protein H , and mast cell growth factor was upregulated by myoseverin . In vivo , these molecules can recruit cells of the immune system to help clear dead cells and debris and provide protection against infection at a site of tissue injury 16 , 17 . In addition , myoseverin increases the expres - sion levels of genes involved in purine catabolism , detoxification , and resistance to oxidative stress , and downregulates the expression of apoptosis - inducing genes such as Fas antigen and TDAG51 . Myoseverin may promote cell survival by downregulating MyD118 and GADD45 , two stress - induced proteins that would otherwise lead to apoptosis and cell growth inhibition 19 . Among growth factors with a role in muscle development , myo - severin treatment upregulated expression of inhibin b - B , a meso - derm inducer , and downregulated follistatin , a mesoderm inhibitor 19 . Myoseverin also upregulated the expression of the recep - tor of fgf4 , a signal that blocks terminal differentiation 20 and sustains myoblast migration in the developing limb 21 . Other changes induced by the compound involve transcripts for secreted growth factors that communicate with bone and epithelia surrounding muscle , and genes like proliferin that convey chemotactic and angiogenic signals to endothelial cells 22 . Experiments in urodeles have suggested that changes in the expression of developmentally regulated genes and clotting factor - associated proteins ( e . g . , thrombomodulin ) are asso - ciated with a regenerative response 23 . Myoseverin may promote cell proliferation without directly tar - geting a cell cycle - regulatory protein . As in other cells , myoblast dif - ferentiation is accompanied by the activation of biochemical path - ways that inhibit the activity of cyclin - dependent kinases , arresting cell cycle progression . Nevertheless , myotubes are a special type of cell , in part because of their multinucleated organization . It is possi - ble that disruption of microtubules breaks the myotube into compo - nent cells , thereby releasing one of several cell cycle - inhibitory mechanisms . Because the effects of the compound are reversible , microtubules reorganize once the compound is removed . Although its overall effect on cellular differentiation may be small , myotube fission can significantly enhance the ability of cells to grow and divide in response to growth stimuli by restoring nuclear autonomy and reconstituting the chromosome complement of normal diploid cells . Although microtubules are generally associated with mitosis and the process of cell division 24 , the effect of myoseverin empha - sizes an important role played by microtubules in nondividing cells . The transcriptional effects of myoseverin suggest the possibility of identifying small molecules that prime the natural regenerative capacity of tissues . For tissue engineering applications , the approach presented above can be translated to assays that use differentiated , primary cells derived directly from human organs , or stem cells that can be induced to differentiate into different cell types . Experimental protocol Chemical synthesis . Myoseverin derivatives were synthesized as described 9 . For the affinity label ( Fig . 3 ) , the free amine at the N9 position was substitut - ed with a trifunctional linker containing a biotin moiety and a chemically reactive bromo acetamide ( Y . - T . Chang et al . , manuscript in preparation ) . All other reagents were obtained from Sigma / Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) , unless otherwise indicated . Primary screens and cell viability assays . C2C12 muscle cells ( CRL 1772 stock , ATCC , Rockville , MD ) were maintained at 37 ° C , in 5 % CO 2 . Proliferating C2C12 myoblasts were maintained in growth medium ( GM : DMEM , Gibco , Grand Island , NY , plus 20 % fetal calf serum ) and induced to form myotubes in differentiation medium ( DM : DMEM plus 2 % horse serum ) for four days or longer . Cells in 96 - well plates were incubated with a 2 , 6 , 9 - trisubstituted purine library 9 , with one compound ( 10 m M ) per well . Figure 4 . Myoseverin facilitates cell cycle re - entry .

Cell viability was determined with the metabolic indicator dye , 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylth - iazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyl tetrazolium ( MTT ) bromide 25 . Trypan blue ( Sigma ) was used to determine whether the plasma membrane remained intact after myotube fission . Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase - mediated dUTP end - labeling ( TUNEL ) assays ( Boehringer - Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) were performed on cells 9 , which were visualized microscopically to detect apoptot - ic nuclei . Reassembly of myotubes was monitored by incubating cells with 2 . 5 m M compound until myotube disassembly was complete , washing out the compound , and incubating cells in fresh DM for four days . Immunocytochemistry . After treatment , cells were extracted , fixed , blocked with 2 % BSA , and incubated with a primary monoclonal antibody 11 ( MF20 anti - SMMHC developed by D . A . Fischman , or E7 anti - tubulin devel - oped by M . Klymkowsky ) obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ( Iowa City , IA ) . The secondary antibody was fluorescein - labeled , anti - mouse IgG from horse ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA ) . Cells were counterstained with Hoescht 33258 ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) or rhodamine - phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) , mounted on slides , and observed with a Zeiss Axioskop epifluorescence microscope . To assay myotube disassembly , the number of myotubes in the microscope field of view at 400 · magnification was determined with phase contrast optics . For nuclear counts , differentiated cells were stained with both anti - SMMHC ( fluorescein ) and Hoescht 33258 . Only nuclei surrounded by SMMHC - labeled cytoplasm were included in the counts . Microtubules and nuclei were visualized with the fluorescein and DAPI filter sets , respectively . Affinity labeling . Cells were incubated with 10 m M biotinylated myosev - erin affinity label , the label plus 100 m M myoseverin , or 0 . 1 % DMSO for 1 h . Cells were then washed in PBS and extracted with EB plus 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 . ( EB : 50 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , and protease inhibitor cocktail , Boehringer - Mannheim ) . Extracts were cleared by cen - trifugation and incubated with streptavidin - coated magnetic beads for 1 h . Beads were washed with 2 % Nonidet in EB and boiled in SDS - sample buffer . Equivalent protein concentrations were separated by 12 % SDS – PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes . Primary antibody labeling was detected with an alkaline - phosphatase secondary antibody ( Sigma ) with the NBT / BCIP reaction ( Pierce Chemical Co . , Rockford , IL ) . Tubulin polymerization assays . Rhodamine - labeled , purified tubulin ( Cytoskeleton , Inc . , Denver , CO ) was incubated in the presence of 50 m M compound or in 0 . 5 % DMSO at 4°C . Polymerization reactions 26 were carried out for 30 min in Assay Buffer with 500 m M GTP at 37ºC . A 5 m l aliquot of the reaction was placed on a glass slide and overlaid with a glass coverslip . The presence or absence of microtubules was visually scored by epifluorescence microscopy under 400 · magnification with a rhodamine filter set . Cell proliferation assays . BrdU incorporation was determined with a commercially available ELISA - type assay ( Boehringer - Mannheim ) in a 96 - well plate format . Absorbance was measured with an EAR400 - AT plate read - er . For colony - forming assays , cultures were detached from individual wells of 96 - well plates with trypsin and replated at low densities in GM for two to three days ; individual colonies were counted under 100 · magnification using phase contrast optics . Growth - inhibitory activity of myoseverin and other microtubule inhibitors on proliferating myoblasts was determined with the MTT assay in 96 - well plates . AChR staining and FACS analysis . Adherent cells were incubated with 10 m g ml - 1 Fl - or TR - Btxn ( Molecular Probes ) in DM for 30 min at 30ºC in 5 % CO 2 / 95 % air . For FACS analysis , cultures were washed in PBS and detached from the plates with trypsin . Cells were resuspended in GM and kept on ice . Gated cell populations were sorted based on size and AChR expression with a Coulter instrument . To compare treated versus untreated samples , gating parameters were kept constant . For comparison , equal numbers of sorted , AChR - positive cells were transferred to 24 - well plates or tissue culture flasks . Cells were then grown for two to three days in GM at 37ºC in 5 % CO 2 / 95 % air . Colonies derived from single cells were counted under 100 · magnifica - tion . For microscopic visualization of AChRs , cells were grown and differen - tiated on glass coverslips , stained with Fl - btxn , fixed with 2 % paraformalde - hyde , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and counterstained with anti - tubulin immunofluorescence and , 1 m g ml - 1 Hoescht , all in PBS . Transcriptional profiles . Differentiated myocytes in DM were treated for 24 h with ‘20 m M myoseverin’ , ‘ 2 ’ , or with ‘0 . 2 % DMSO’ . Sample preparation was performed according to established protocols 27 , 28 . Poly - A + mRNA was obtained with mRNA Direct microkit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) , and converted into dou - ble - stranded cDNA with the SuperScript Choice System ( Life Technologies , Rockville , MD ) using an oligo - dT primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter . In vitro transcription was carried out with the T7 Megascript kit ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) using double - stranded cDNA template , NTPs , and biotinylated CTP and UTP as labels . Biotinylated cRNA product was purified with an RNeasy affinity column ( Qiagen ) and fragmented to 30 – 60 base frag - ments by heating to 95ºC for 30 min . Hybridization experiments were per - formed in duplicate on Affymetrix Mu6500 oligonucleotide arrays . Each hybridized chip was stained with streptavidin - phycoerythrin ( PE ) and scanned with a GeneArray Scanner ( Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA ) . Signal was then amplified with an anti - strepatvidin , PE - labeled antibody in order to facilitate detection of transcripts expressed at low levels , and the chip was rescanned . Data analysis . Analysis was performed as described 27 , 28 . The presence of each mRNA is determined according to the hybridization intensity across 20 pairs of probes , each pair consisting of a perfect - match and a single - base mismatched probe to serve as a control as well as to enable subtraction of background and cross - hybridization signals . The data were analyzed with the GeneChip expression analysis software ( version 3 . 1 ) , as described 27 . 1 . Black , B . L . & Olson , E . N .
