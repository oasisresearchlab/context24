In leader blebs , is a rapid flow of cortical actin that drives the cell forward . Using RNAi , we find that co - depleting cofilin - 1 and ADF led to a large increase in cortical actin , suggesting that both proteins regulate cortical actin . Furthermore , severing factors can promote contractility through the regulation of actin architecture . However , RNAi of cofilin - 1 but not ADF led to a significant decrease in cell stiffness . We found cofilin - 1 to be enriched at leader bleb necks , whereas RNAi of cofilin - 1 and ADF reduced bleb sizes and the frequency of motile cells . Strikingly , cells without cofilin - 1 and ADF had blebs with abnormally long necks . Many of these blebs failed to retract and displayed slow actin turnover . Collectively , our data identifies cofilin - 1 and ADF as actin remodeling factors required for fast amoeboid migration .

For mesenchymal migration , actin assembly / disassembly and myosin contraction must occur within specific regions of the cell ( 1 ) . Relative to other , recently described modes of migration , the mechanisms by which mesenchymal cells coordinate these processes are reasonably well understood . Whereas , in amoeboid cells , which migrate using intracellular driven protrusions of the Plasma Membrane ( PM ) or blebs , the mechanisms conferring spatiotemporal control of the F - actin cytoskeleton are not well known . Within tissues , cells encounter a variety of physicochemical environments . We and others discovered that in response to tissue confinement , cancer cells frequently undergo a phenotypic transition to what was termed , fast amoeboid migration ( 2 - 5 ) . A hallmark of amoeboid migration is the presence of blebs , which form as a result of PM - cortical actin separation ( 6 ) . Typically , blebs are rapidly retracted following the reassembly of cortical actin on bleb membranes and the recruitment of myosin ( 6 ) . However , during fast amoeboid migration , cells form a very large and stable bleb . Within these blebs , is a cortical actin network that flows from the bleb tip to the neck , which separates leader blebs from the cell body ( 2 - 5 ) . Together with non - specific friction , flowing cortical actin provides the motive force for cell movement ( 4 ) . Accordingly , we simultaneously termed this mode of migration , Leader Bleb - Based Migration ( LBBM ) ( 2 ) . Because migration plasticity is thought to be a major contributor of metastasis , our aim here is to identify the essential factors required for the rapid cortical actin flow in leader blebs . Previous studies have demonstrated that myosin is enriched at the neck of leader blebs . Indeed , the myosin at this location has been shown to be required for rapid cortical actin flow ( 3 - 5 ) . However , what drives the disassembly of F - actin at the neck to replenish the pool of G - actin at the leader bleb tip is unknown . Thus , we hypothesize that actin disassembly factors within leader blebs play a pivotal role in this process . Similarly , in mesenchymal cells , retrograde actin flow is driven by both myosin contraction and actin disassembly , the latter of which is accelerated by the ADF / cofilin family of severing factors ( 7 ) . Severing depends on ADF / cofilin inducing a structural change within the actin filament , an activity known to be repressed by LIM Kinase ( LIMK ) phosphorylation on Ser 3 ( 8 ) . However , the consequence of actin severing is variable , depending on the availability of barbed end capping proteins . At a sufficiently high level , new barbed ends are capped , promoting actin disassembly from new pointed ends ( 9 ) . Conversely , if left uncapped , increased polymerization from new barbed ends may occur ( 9 ) . Additionally , by competing for F - actin binding ( e . g . , Arp2 / 3 ) , ADF / cofilin can regulate actin architecture ( 10 ) . The effects of ADF / cofilin on cortical actin are even less certain , as the focus of many studies has been on the actin within lamellipodia . Therefore , we set out to determine the role of ADF / cofilin in regulating the cortical actin cytoskeleton in fast amoeboid cells . 4 By combining an in vitro assay for the precise confinement of cells with quantitative imaging approaches , we report that ADF and cofilin - 1 , together , are required for the rapid disassembly of incoming cortical actin at leader bleb necks . Under conditions of confinement , we find that melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma cells depleted of both proteins display dramatic defects in bleb morphology and dynamics . Consequently , cells without ADF and cofilin - 1 cannot undergo LBBM . Thus , we reveal unanticipated roles for ADF and cofilin - 1 in driving confined ( leader bleb - based ) migration . Results ADF and cofilin - 1 are required for leader bleb - based migration Using our previously described approach for cell confinement , which involves placing cells under a slab of PDMS held at a defined height ( ~ 3 Âµm ) above cover glass , cancer cells will switch to LBBM ( Fig . 1A & Movie S1 ) ( 11 ) . Moreover , within leader blebs , we find a rapid flow of cortical actin , which together with non - specific friction , provides the motive force for cell movement ( Fig . 1B & Movie S2 ) ( 5 ) . As indicated by an enrichment in EGFP tagged Regulatory Light Chain ( EGFP - RLC ) , we observe a concentration of myosin at the leader bleb neck that separates the leader bleb from the cell body ( Fig . 1C & Movie S2 ) ( 3 - 5 ) . In concert with myosin , we wondered if the cortical actin flow in leader blebs requires the action of specific actin disassembly factors . In addition to being frequently up - regulated in cancer , the ADF / cofilin family of actin severing factors are known to be essential for actin turnover in mesenchymal cells ( 7 , 12 ) . Therefore , we set out to determine if ADF and / or cofilin - 1 are important for LBBM . Using melanoma A375 cells , a widely used cell line for the study of amoeboid migration , we depleted cells of ADF and cofilin - 1 alone and together by RNAi ( Fig . 1D & S1A ) . By manually tracking the movement of cells over time , we found that cells depleted of cofilin - 1 were significantly less motile ( Fig . 1E - H ) . Additionally , the adhesive transmigration of cells through small pores was hindered after depleting cofilin - 1 ( Fig . S1B ) . Depleting cells of ADF led to a slight reduction in the number of highly motile cells ( Fig . 1E - H ) . Strikingly , depleting cells of both ADF and cofilin - 1 appeared to have an additive effect on reducing LBBM , whereas the adhesive transmigration of cells through small pores did not display this additive behavior and was not affected by ADF depletion ( Fig . 1E - H & S1B ) . These results suggest that these proteins play non - overlapping roles during LBBM ( Fig . 1E - H ) . In agreement with this concept , transfection of EGFP - cofilin - 1 into cells depleted of both proteins was insufficient to restore LBBM ( Fig . 1E - H & S1B ) . Together , ADF and cofilin - 1 are required to retract blebs Subsequently , we wanted to know what is responsible for the decrease in LBBM upon depleting ADF and / or cofilin - 1 . Initially , we analyzed the area of the largest bleb ( i . e . , leader bleb ) , relative to the cell body , in cells depleted of cofilin - 1 . This analysis revealed that depleting cells 5 of cofilin - 1 reduced the area of the largest bleb to ~ 30 % of control ( non - targeting ; Fig . 2A - B & Movies S3 - 5 ) . The area of all blebs was similarly reduced ( Fig . 2C ) . Strikingly , in cells depleted of both ADF and cofilin - 1 , ~ 30 % of cells displayed blebs with elongated necks ( Fig . 2A , D & Movie S6 ) . Detailed analyses of these cells revealed that ~ 60 % display blebs that never retract into the cell body ( Fig . 2E ) . Moreover , we found this effect to not be specific to melanoma A375 cells , as depleting lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells of both ADF and cofilin - 1 similarly resulted in the elongation of bleb necks ( Fig . 2F - G ) . In melanoma A375 cells , depleting both ADF and cofilin - 1 had an additive effect on reducing the rate of bleb retraction , which points to these proteins having non - overlapping functions specifically at bleb necks ( Fig . 2H ) . In support of this role , we determined the location of EGFP - cofilin - 1 in confined cells . Our initial efforts were unsuccessful because of a high degree of soluble ( i . e . , unbound to F - actin ) protein , but in cells depleted of endogenous ADF and cofilin - 1 we could detect an enrichment of EGFP - cofilin - 1 at leader bleb necks ( Fig . 2I ; arrow ) . ADF and cofilin - 1 rapidly disassemble cortical actin Thus far , our results suggest that ADF and cofilin - 1 are important for the rapid turnover of cortical actin at bleb necks . In agreement with this concept , a large concentration of F - actin is found at the necks of blebs in cells depleted of ADF and cofilin - 1 ( Fig . 3A ) . In order to more directly test the role of ADF and cofilin - 1 in regulating cortical actin , we turned to freshly trypsinized ( spherical ) cells . In spherical cells , actin is predominantly cortical and endogenous cofilin - 1 is diffuse throughout the cytoplasm with some enrichment at the cell periphery ( Fig . 3B ) . By combining the specificity of phalloidin for F - actin with flow cytometry , we then determined how the level of cortical actin is affected by ADF and / or cofilin - 1 depletion . In cells depleted of cofilin - 1 , F - actin levels were increased by ~ 10 % , whereas depletion of ADF did not lead to a significant change in the level of F - actin ( Fig . 3C ) . Interestingly , depleting ADF with cofilin - 1 had the largest effect , increasing F - actin levels by ~ 30 % ( Fig . 3C ) . Serine 3 of cofilin - 1 is phosphorylated by LIM Kinase ( LIMK ) , inhibiting its severing activity ( 8 ) . In cells depleted of endogenous ADF and cofilin - 1 , transfection of EGFP - cofilin - 1 reduced the level of F - actin to levels similar to control ( non - target ; Fig . 3D ) . Similarly , F - actin was restored to near control levels by transfection of EGFP - cofilin - 1 ( S3A ; constitutively active ) , whereas transfection of EGFP - cofilin - 1 ( S3E ; constitutively inactive ) led to an increased level of F - actin ( Fig . 3D ) . Additionally , in comparison to EGFP alone , increasing levels of EGFP - cofilin - 1 correlated with reductions in F - actin ( Fig . 3E ) . Thus , cortical actin levels are regulated by ADF and cofilin - 1 severing . Many studies have shown that cofilin - 1 severing can result in distinct outcomes . In lamellipodia , cofilin - 1 severing promotes actin polymerization at new barbed ends , whereas in the lamella , actin is de - polymerized at new pointed ends ( 7 ) . The prevalence of each outcome has been proposed to depend on the concentration of capping proteins ( 9 ) . Therefore , we determined the relative level of barbed ends within the cortical actin network of freshly trypsinized ( spherical ) cells . The treatment of cells with cytochalasin B ( which blocks G - actin 6 from binding the barbed end ) confirmed the specificity of the approach ( Fig . S2A ) . In cells depleted of cofilin - 1 , we observed a more than ~ 50 % increase the level of cortical barbed ends , whereas depleting ADF marginally increased the level of cortical barbed ends ( Fig . 3G ) . Depleting cells of both proteins appeared to have an additive effect , increasing the level of cortical barbed ends by ~ 100 % ( Fig . 3G ) . However , in cells depleted of ADF and cofilin - 1 , transfection of EGFP - cofilin - 1 was sufficient to restore cortical barbed ends to a level similar to control ( Fig . 3H ) . Collectively , these results suggest that ADF and cofilin - 1 regulate cortical actin levels by promoting the de - polymerization of actin at newly formed pointed ends . Rapid cortical actin flow requires ADF and cofilin - 1 severing at leader bleb necks Lasting changes in the F / G - actin ratio , such as occurs during RNAi of ADF and / or cofilin - 1 , can have a range of effects on cellular physiology . Therefore , using a previously described SuperNova - cofilin - 1 construct , we performed Chromophore Assisted Light Inactivation ( CALI ) for establishing the direct effects of cofilin - 1 depletion ( 13 , 14 ) . In cells depleted of ADF and cofilin - 1 , SuperNova - cofilin - 1 is predominantly observed at leader bleb necks ( Fig . 4A ) . After 1 min of intense red light irradiation , we found that ~ 50 % of SuperNova - cofilin - 1 is destroyed , as indicated by a reduction in red fluorescence ( Fig . 4A ) . Using LifeAct - mEmerald for monitoring actin dynamics , we observed an accumulation of actin and the elongation of leader bleb necks within minutes of inactivating cofilin - 1 ( Fig . 4B & Movie S7 ) . Moreover , after inactivating SuperNova - cofilin - 1 , cortical actin flow rates in leader blebs were reduced by ~ 50 % , whereas irradiation of SuperNova alone did not change actin flow rates ( Fig . 4C - D & S3A ) . Thus , as demonstrated by CALI , cofilin - 1 directly regulates the cortical actin in leader blebs . We then determined rates of actin turnover at leader bleb necks . For this , we used a version of LifeAct tagged with the photoactivable ( green / red ) fluorescent protein , mEos , for performing Fluorescence Loss After Photoactivation ( FLAP ) assays . Using a 405 nm laser , a pool of mEos - LifeAct was photoactivated at leader bleb necks . Subsequently , fluorescence decay at leader bleb necks was measured and used for determining rates of actin turnover ( Fig 4E ) . To demonstrate proof of concept , curves were fit with a single phase decay , yielding an R - squared value of 0 . 8348 ( Fig . 4F ) . In contrast , a rapid decline in red fluorescence was not observed in paraformaldehyde treated cells ( Fig . S3B ) . In control ( non - target ) cells , we found the actin at leader bleb necks to be rapidly turned over ( t 1 / 2 ; Fig . 4G ) . While the rate of actin turnover in cells depleted of cofilin - 1 or ADF alone was similar to control ( non - target ) , depleting both ADF and cofilin - 1 led to a significant decrease in the actin turnover rate ( t 1 / 2 ; Fig . 4G ) . These data suggest that ADF and cofilin - 1 , together , are critical for the rapid turnover of cortical actin at leader bleb necks . Cofilin - 1 supports both actin turnover and myosin contractility at leader bleb necks Because the cortical actin flow in leader blebs is driven by myosin , we wondered if ADF and / or cofilin - 1 are important for cortical contractility . To address this possibility , we 7 determined the compressibility of cells using a previously described gel sandwich approach ( 3 ) . Briefly , freshly trypsinized ( spherical ) cells are placed between two polyacrylamide gels of known stiffness ( 1 kPa ) . Subsequently , the ratio of the cell height ( h ) to the diameter ( d ) is used to determine compressibility ( Fig . 5A ) . After depleting cofilin - 1 , we found cells to be significantly more compressible , whereas depleting ADF had no effect ( Fig . 5A ) . Moreover , in cofilin - 1 depleted cells , the depletion of ADF did not have any additional effect on cell compressibility ( Fig . 5A ) . Therefore , cofilin - 1 may be particularly important for contractility . In support of this idea , cofilin - 1 has been shown to modulate contractility through a variety of mechanisms , which involve changes in both actin turnover and network architecture ( 10 , 15 , 16 ) . As determined by immunofluorescence imaging of phosphorylated Regulatory Light Chain ( pRLC ) , we could confirm that signaling to myosin was not significantly affected by depleting ADF and / or cofilin - 1 ( Fig . 5B - C ) . In confined cells , depleting ADF and cofilin - 1 leads to the elongation of leader bleb necks , which are decorated with myosin ( RLC - EGFP ; Fig . 5D ) . We then used CALI to determine if the accumulation of myosin at leader blebs necks is directly caused by the removal of these proteins . Indeed , within minutes of SuperNova - cofilin - 1 inactivation , we observed myosin accumulating at leader bleb necks ( RLC - EGFP ; Fig . 5E & Movie S8 ) . Additionally , the flow of myosin towards leader bleb necks was significantly impeded after cofilin - 1 inactivation , as determined by tracking individual myosin minifilaments ( Fig . 5F ) . While ADF may be particularly important for actin turnover , these results point to cofilin - 1 as having important roles in both actin turnover and myosin contractility at leader bleb necks . Discussion Here , we identify ADF and cofilin - 1 as key mediators of the rapid ( cortical ) actin flow in leader blebs . This is significant as the rapid flow of cortical actin in leader blebs is essential for confined migration ( 3 - 5 ) . We report that melanoma cells depleted of cofilin - 1 poorly undergo LBBM , whereas removing ADF did not have a significant effect . Because ADF and cofilin - 1 are thought to have redundant or overlapping roles , we were surprised to then find that depleting cofilin - 1 together with ADF led to a near complete inhibition of LBBM . Therefore , we set out to determine the basis for this effect in cancer cells . Initially , we used high spatial and temporal resolution imaging for close inspection of RNAi cells . Cells lacking cofilin - 1 alone had much smaller blebs . This result is in line with previous work showing that cofilin - 1 supports myosin contractility through optimizing actin filament lengths and de - branching ( 10 , 15 , 16 ) . Without both cofilin - 1 and ADF , many cells had blebs with elongated necks that would not retract . A similar bleb defect has also been reported in HeLa cells ( 17 ) . This led us to wonder if ADF and / or cofilin - 1 may be important for actin turnover at bleb necks . In agreement with this concept , in cells lacking endogenous cofilin - 1 and ADF , EGFP - cofilin - 1 was enriched at bleb necks . 8 In confined cells , we observed a dramatic accumulation of actin at bleb necks . In order to better understand how ADF and cofilin - 1 regulate the overall level of cortical actin , we utilized spherical cells which predominantly have cortical actin . Using flow cytometry , we found that depleting cells of cofilin - 1 could significantly increase the overall level of actin . Although ADF on its own had no effect , depleting cofilin - 1 with ADF increased the overall level of actin even further , which might suggest that ADF augments the severing activity of cofilin - 1 . Similarly , the level of cortical barbed ends was significantly increased in the absence of cofilin - 1 , whereas removing ADF marginally increased the level of cortical barbed ends . Depleting both cofilin - 1 and ADF appeared to have an additive effect , leading to the largest increase in the level of uncapped ( polymerization competent ) barbed ends . This result suggests that cofilin - 1 severing , in collaboration with ADF , leads to the rapid disassembly of cortical actin and not polymerization at new barbed ends . Because changes in the cellular F / G - actin ratio can trigger specific transcriptional programs , such as through the activation of the transcription factor , MRTF - A , we wanted to determine if the effects we observed on LBBM are a direct result of down regulating actin severing ( 18 ) . For this , we utilized CALI for the rapid inactivation of SuperNova - cofilin - 1 . In cells depleted of ADF and cofilin - 1 , SuperNova - coflin - 1 was sufficient to restore normal bleb morphology and dynamics . However , within minutes of cofilin - 1 inactivation , actin began to accumulate at elongated bleb necks . By kymograph analysis , we also observed a significant decrease in the cortical actin flow rate . Using a photoactivatable LifeAct construct , we then directly measured the rate of actin turnover ( i . e . , fluorescence decay ) at bleb necks . While depleting ADF or cofilin - 1 alone did not have a significant effect on actin turnover rates , depleting both proteins led to a large increase in the rate of actin turnover at bleb necks . Thus , in cells lacking ADF and cofilin - 1 , defects in bleb morphology and dynamics correlate with a reduction in actin turnover at the neck . Cofilin - 1 has been previously implicated in regulating actomyosin contractility . Therefore , using spherical cells , we determined the overall effect of ADF and cofilin - 1 on cortical contractility . As indicated by increased compressibility , cells were found to be less stiff after depleting cofilin - 1 . In contrast , removing ADF had little effect on cell stiffness . Moreover , depleting both ADF and cofilin - 1 was similar to removing cofilin - 1 alone . Therefore , cofilin - 1 may be particularly important to support actomyosin contractility . In line with this notion , cofilin - 1 has been shown to support myosin contractility through optimizing actin filament lengths and de - branching ( 10 , 15 , 16 ) . As indicated by the lack of any change in pRLC levels or localization , removing these proteins does not appear to effect signaling to myosin . The role of cofilin - 1 in supporting myosin contractility is further supported by CALI . More specifically , we demonstrate that inactivating cofilin - 1 decreases the rate at which myosin minifilaments flow towards the bleb neck . Thus , our data are consistent with a model whereby ADF and cofilin - 1 play key roles during LBBM . More specifically , we assert that ADF and cofilin - 1 , together , optimize actin 9 disassembly and myosin contractility at bleb necks ( Fig . 6 , top ) . Whereas , in the absence of these proteins , incoming cortical actin fails to disassemble and accumulates with myosin at the elongated necks of persistent blebs ( Fig . 6 , below ) . Collectively , this study further points to rapid ( cortical ) actin flows as being essential for confined ( leader bleb - based ) migration . This is significant as many cancer cells have been shown to undergo LBBM ( 2 , 3 ) . This work also reveals an unanticipated role for ADF . In melanoma cells , ADF appears to augment the activity of cofilin - 1 at bleb necks . Largely , ADF and cofilin - 1 are thought to have redundant or overlapping roles . However , ADF has been shown to have significant monomer sequestering activity ( 19 ) . We speculate that , in the absence of both proteins , dampened actin severing coupled with uncontrolled filament elongation contributes to the severe phenotypes we observe . Thus , the dissemination of melanoma tumors is likely to be blocked by the simultaneous inhibition of ADF and cofilin - 1 .

A - 21206 ; Thermo Fisher ) was then incubated with cells for 2 hr at room temperature . Cells were then incubated with a 1 : 250 dilution of Alexa Fluor 568 - conjugated phalloidin ( cat no . A12380 ; Thermo Fisher ) and a 1 : 1000 dilution of DAPI ( cat no . D1306 ; Thermo Fisher ) . Cells were again extensively washed and then imaged in HBS . Cell stiffness assay . The protocol for the gel sandwich assay was used with minor modifications ( 3 ) . 6 - well glass bottom plates ( Cellvis ) and 18 mm coverslips were activated using 3 - aminopropyltrimethoxysilane ( Sigma Aldrich ) for 5 min and then for 30 min with 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) in PBS . 1 kPa polyacrylamide gels were made using 2 ÂµL of blue fluorescent beads ( 200 nm ; Thermo Fisher ) , 18 . 8 ÂµL of 40 % acrylamide 12 solution ( cat no . 161 - 0140 ; Bio - Rad ) , and 12 . 5 ÂµL of bis - acrylamide ( cat no . 161 - 0142 ; Bio - Rad ) in 250 ÂµL of PBS . Finally , 2 . 5 ÂµL of Ammonium Persulfate ( APS ; 10 % in water ) and 0 . 5 ÂµL of Tetramethylethylenediamine ( TMED ) was added before spreading 9 ÂµL drops onto treated glass under coverslips . After polymerizing for 40 min , the coverslip was lifted in PBS , extensively rinsed and incubated overnight in PBS . Before each experiment , the gel attached to the coverslip was placed on a 14 mm diameter , 2 cm high PDMS column for applying a slight pressure to the coverslip with its own weight . Then , both gels were incubated for 30 min in media before plates were seeded . After the bottom gels in plates was placed on the microscope stage , the PDMS column with the top gel was placed on top of the cells seeded on the bottom gels , confining cells between the two gels . After 1 hr of adaptation , the height of cells was determined with beads by measuring the distance between gels , whereas the cell diameter was measured using a far - red plasma membrane dye ( cat no . C10046 ; Thermo Fisher ) . Stiffness was defined as the height ( h ) divided by the diameter ( d ) . Microscopy . Live high - resolution imaging was performed using a General Electric ( Boston , MA ) DeltaVision Elite imaging system mounted on an Olympus ( Japan ) IX71 stand with a computerized stage , environment chamber ( heat , CO 2 , and humidifier ) , ultrafast solid - state illumination with excitation / emission filter sets for DAPI , CFP , GFP , YFP , and Cy5 , critical illumination , Olympus PlanApo N 60X / 1 . 42 NA DIC ( oil ) objective , Photometrics ( Tucson , AZ ) CoolSNAP HQ2 camera , proprietary constrained iterative deconvolution , and vibration isolation table . Chromophore Assisted Light Inactivation ( CALI ) . Live confined cells co - transfected with SuperNova - cofilin - 1 and either mEmerald - LifeAct or EGFP - RLC were imaged every 12 sec for 5 min before CALI . Cells were then subjected to 1 min of high intensity red light irradiation ( DeltaVision Elite ) . Images were subsequently acquired every 12 sec for 1 hr post - irradiation . Actomyosin flow rates . Actin and myosin minifilament flow rates were calculated from images taken every 12 sec of mEmerald - LifeAct and EGFP - RLC , respectively . Kymographs of each were generated in Fiji ( https : / / imagej . net / Fiji ) and spanned the length of leader blebs . Fluorescence Loss After Photobleaching ( FLAP ) . Cells transiently transfected with the photoactivatable construct , mEos3 . 2 - LifeAct , were imaged using a Zeiss ( Germany ) laser scanning confocal microscope ( LSM880 ) with fast Airy Scan . Regions at bleb necks were photo - converted using the 405 nm laser at 20 % power ( 3 iterations ) . Regions were sampled every 15 ms for 10 and 150 cycles before and after photo - conversion , respectively . Fluorescence measurements were acquired using ZEN software ( Zeiss ) and decay was calculated as F / F 0 . Non - linear one - phase decay curves were fit to data using GraphPad Prism . 13 Cell migration . To perform cell speed and plot of origin analyses , we used an Excel ( Microsoft , Redmond , WA ) plugin , DiPer , developed by Gorelik and colleagues and the Fiji plugin , MTrackJ , developed by Erik Meijering for manual tracking ( 22 , 23 ) . For minimizing positional error , cells were tracked every other frame . Brightfield imaging was used to confirm that beads were not obstructing the path of a cell . Cells that traveled a distance equivalent to at least one cell length over the course of the 5 hr time - lapse were classified as highly motile . Bleb morphology and dynamics . For leader bleb and total bleb areas , freshly confined cells were traced from high - resolution images with the free - hand circle tool in Fiji ( https : / / imagej . net / Fiji ) . From every other frame , the percentage of cell area for leader blebs and percentage of cell area for total blebs were calculated in Excel ( Microsoft ) . Frame - by - frame measurements were then used to generate an average for each cell . Bleb retraction rates were determined by dividing the bleb length by the amount of time taken to completely retract the bleb into the cell body . For each cell , retraction rates were calculated from 2 - 3 blebs . Statistics . All box plots are Tukey in which â + â and line denote the mean and median , respectively . Sample sizes were determined empirically and based on saturation . As noted in each figure legend , statistical significance was determined by either a two - tailed Studentâs t - test or multiple - comparison test post - hoc . Normality was determined by a DâAgostino & Pearson test in GraphPad Prism . * - p â¤ 0 . 05 , * * - p â¤ 0 . 01 , * * * - p â¤ 0 . 001 , and * * * * - p â¤ 0 . 0001 Illustration .
