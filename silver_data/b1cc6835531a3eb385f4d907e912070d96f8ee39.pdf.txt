Molecular Biology of the Cell Vol . 11 , 1113 – 1127 , April 2000 Functional Interactions between the p35 Subunit of the Arp2 / 3 Complex and Calmodulin in Yeast Claudia Schaerer - Brodbeck and Howard Riezman * Biozentrum of the University of Basel , CH - 4056 Basel , Switzerland Submitted September 13 , 1999 ; Revised January 10 , 2000 ; Accepted January 21 , 2000 Monitoring Editor : Suzanne R . Pfeffer The end9 - 1 ( arc35 - 1 ) mutant was identiﬁed as an endocytosis mutant and is a mutant allele of ARC35 that encodes a subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex . As for other mutants in the Arp2 / 3 complex , arc35 - 1 is defective for endocytosis and organization of the actin cytoskeleton . Both defects can be suppressed by overexpression of calmodulin . Analysis of a collection of tempera - ture - sensitive cmd1 mutants for their ability to suppress either the endocytic defect and / or the actin defect indicates that the two defects are tightly coupled . We demonstrate that Arc35p and Cmd1p interact and that Arc35p is required for cortical localization of calmodulin . This is the ﬁrst report linking Arp2 / 3 complex function with calmodulin through which it exercises at least one of its endocytic functions . INTRODUCTION Endocytosis is the process whereby cells internalize part of their own plasma membrane along with extracellular mate - rial facilitating uptake of nutrients , down - regulation of re - ceptors , and removal of damaged or surplus proteins . En - docytosis is mediated by vesicles budding from the cell surface and the delivery of endocytosed material to the lysosome via at least two intermediate compartments ( Sing - er - Kru¨ger et al . , 1993 ; Mukherjee et al . , 1997 ; Clague , 1998 ) . Work in yeast ( Riezman et al . , 1996 ; Wendland et al . , 1998 ) indicates that the actin cytoskeleton plays a fundamental role in endocytosis . Recent evidence , obtained mainly by using the inhibitors cytochalasin D and latrunculin A ( latA ) , suggests an involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in the uptake step of endocytosis in animal cells ( Gottlieb et al . , 1993 ; Jackman et al . , 1994 ; Durrbach et al . , 1996 ; Shurety et al . , 1996 ; Lamaze et al . , 1997 ; Freedman et al . , 1999 ; Valentijn et al . , 1999 ) . The development of quantitative assays for receptor - me - diated endocytosis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Du - lic et al . , 1991 ) combined with genetics has led to the iden - tiﬁcation of numerous genes involved in the internalization step of endocytosis ( Munn and Riezman , 1994 ) . Genes reg - ulating lipid metabolism and various genes involved in building or regulating the actin cytoskeleton were isolated in the screen . In addition , calmodulin ( Ku¨bler et al . , 1994 ) and the actin - related protein Arp2 ( Moreau et al . , 1997 ) , which regulate the actin cytoskeleton , were shown to be involved in the uptake step of endocytosis . Other screens have also led to the isolation of endocytosis mutants affecting actin dynamics ( Wendland et al . , 1996 ; Singer - Kru¨ger and Ferro - Novick , 1997 ) . Calmodulin is a major calcium sensor conserved from yeast to human . One single essential gene ( CMD1 ) encodes calmodulin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Davis et al . , 1986 ) . Calmodulin plays a fundamental role in endocytosis in yeast ( Ku¨bler et al . , 1994 ; Geli et al . , 1998 ) . The calmodulin require - ment may be calcium - independent because the mutant cmd1 - 3 , impaired in calcium binding in vitro ( Geiser et al . , 1991 ) , allowed virtually wild - type internalization kinetics ( Ku¨bler et al . , 1994 ) . Calmodulin has been puriﬁed from clathrin - coated vesicles and was shown to interact with clathrin light - chain ( Salisbury et al . , 1980 ; Pley et al . , 1995 ) . Calmodulin antagonists were shown to stimulate endocyto - sis of ricin in Madin – Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells ( Llorente et al . , 1996 ) and sequestration of serotonin 5 - HT1A receptor in CHO cells ( Della Rocca et al . , 1999 ) . On the other hand , calmodulin antagonists inhibited transcytosis of IgA in MDCK cells ( Enrich et al . , 1996 ) and sequestration of histamine H1 receptors in human astrocytoma cells ( Hishi - numa et al . , 1998 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex has been puriﬁed from Acanthamoeba ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ) , human platelets ( Welch et al . , 1997b ) , human neutrophils ( Machesky et al . , 1997 ) , and S . cerevisiae ( Winter et al . , 1997 ) . It has been shown to consist of seven subunits in Acanthamoeba and human and of six subunits in yeast . Two of the subunits are the highly conserved actin - related proteins , Arp2 and Arp3 . Components of the Arp2 / 3 complex have been localized to the cortical actin cytoskele - ton in Acanthamoeba ( Kelleher et al . , 1995 ) , in human ( Welch et al . , 1997a ) , in S . cerevisiae ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ; Winter et al . , 1997 ) , and in Schizosaccharomyces pombe ( McCollum et al . , 1996 ) . Activities demonstrated for the Arp2 / 3 complex in - clude actin ( Mullins et al . , 1997 ) and proﬁlin binding ( Ma - * Corresponding author .

Mutations in the S . cerevisiae Arp2 gene have been found to cause a defect in the internalization step of endo - cytosis ( Moreau et al . , 1997 ) . The above ﬁndings lead to the exciting possibility that the Arp2 / 3 complex may organize actin ﬁlaments at the sites of membrane dynamics ( Ma - chesky , 1997 ) . In this study , we demonstrate that mutations in the ARC35 gene lead to defects both in the internalization step of endocytosis and in the organization of the actin cytoskele - ton . Both the endocytic and actin defects can be suppressed by overexpression of calmodulin . Analysis of a series of temperature - sensitive ( ts ) cmd1 mutant alleles for their abil - ity to suppress the endocytic defect , the actin defect , and / or ts growth indicates that the endocytic and actin defects are tightly coupled . Two - hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation data indicate that Arc35p and Cmd1p interact . The involve - ment of Arc35p in endocytosis is likely to involve localiza - tion of Cmd1p to cortical sites for interaction with an essen - tial endocytic target . Taken together , the data presented provide a novel function of the Arp2 / 3 complex in endocy - tosis via calmodulin .

All DNA fragments were puriﬁed with the Geneclean II Kit ( Bio 101 , Vista , CA ) ; all plasmids were puriﬁed with the Qiagen plasmid puriﬁcation kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) , and transformation of E . coli was performed by electroporation ( Dower et al . , 1988 ) . All PCRs for cloning purposes were performed with a DNA polymerase with proof - reading activ - ity ( Pfu , Stratagene Cloning Systems ) on a TRIO - thermoblock ( Bi - ometra GmbH , Goettingen , Germany ) . Oligonucleotides were syn - thesized by Microsynth GmbH ( Balgach , Switzerland ) .

The arc35 - 1 allele was ampliﬁed from genomic DNA from the strain RH3429 with the primers ARC352HYB - 1 ( 5 9 - GGC CGA CTC GAG CTA CAC TTA CAA CCA ) and ARC352HYB - 2 ( 5 9 - GGC CGA CTC GAG CGT ACT TAT TTA ATC ) , both of which include an Xho I site for in - frame ligation to the lexA DNA binding domain of pEG202 ( Ruden et al . , 1991 ) , cut with Xho I , and treated with CIP . The cmd1 mutant alleles for cloning into pASZ12 were ampliﬁed from genomic DNA of the strains RH2584 , DBY7443 , DBY7449 , DBY7446 , and DBY7445 or from plasmid pYOC547 with the primers CMDASZ - 1 ( 5 9 - ACG CGT CGA CAT GTA TTT ATA TTT TCG TGT A ) and CMDASZ - 2 ( 5 9 - ACG CGT CGA CAG AAT GGT AAG GGT AAG ATA G ) for RH2584 or primers CMDASZ - 3 ( 5 9 - CGC GGA TCC ATG TAT TTA TAT TTT CGT GTA ) and CMDASZ - 4 ( 5 9 - TGA CAT GCA TGC AGA ATG GTA AGG GTA AGA TAG ) for all other alleles . Primers CMDASZ - 1 and CMDASZ - 2 include a Sal I restriction site for cloning into pASZ12 ( Stotz and Linder , 1990 ) , cut open at Sal I , and treated with CIP . Primers CMDASZ - 3 and CMDASZ - 4 bear a Bam HI or Sph I site for cloning into pASZ12 ( Stotz and Linder , 1990 ) , cut open with Bam HI and Sph I , and treated with CIP . The cmd1 mutant alleles for the con - struction of the pJG4 – 5 series were ampliﬁed as described using the primers CMD2H - 1 ( 5 9 - CCG CTC GAG TCC TCC AAT CTT ACC GAA GAA ) and CMD2H - 2 ( 5 9 - CCG CTC GAG CTA TTT AGA TAA CAA AGC AGC ) . Both primers bear an Xho I restriction site for in - frame cloning to the acid blob domain B42 of pJG4 - 5 ( Gyuris et al . , 1993 ) , cut with Xho I , and treated with CIP . Protein Techniques and Antibodies SDS - PAGE for protein separation was performed as described ( Lae - mmli , 1970 ) using a Minigel System ( Hoefer Scientiﬁc Instruments , San Francisco , CA ) . Acrylamide gels ( 16 . 5 % ) were used to separate Cmd1p , Arc35p , and Act1p . Low - range SDS - PAGE molecular weight standards ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) were used for determination of apparent molecular weight . Total yeast protein extractions were performed as described ( Horvath and Riezman , 1994 ) . Western blotting was performed as described ( Horvath and Riezman , 1994 ) , except for the use of 10 % ( wt / vol ) milk and the addition of 0 . 1 % ( vol / vol ) Nonidet P - 40 in the solutions for blocking and subsequent incubations . Incubation with the primary antibod - ies , a - Cmd1p and a - Arc35p - N at a dilution of 1 : 1000 and a - actin ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany ) at 10 m g / ml , was fol - lowed by incubation with the secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) . Membranes ( Schlei - cher and Schuell , Dassel , Germany ) were developed using an ECL immunoblotting detection reagent kit ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) . The antibody against Cmd1p has been described ( Geli et al . , 1998 ) . The a - Arc35pN antibody was raised in rabbits against the Arc35p peptide LHLQPQNLLIQTK synthesized by Neosystem Laboratoire ( Strasbourg , France ) . Arc35p antibody speciﬁcity was assessed on immunoblots by comparing extracts from cells expressing ARC35 and ARC35 on a 2 - m plasmid ( see Figure 8A ) . Microscopy The procedure used for immunolocalization of calmodulin was adapted from Sohrmann et al . , 1996 . Fixation was performed during a period of 90 min by adding formaldehyde directly to the culture to a ﬁnal concentration of 3 . 7 % . Incubation with the primary anti - body or the secondary antibody coupled to CY3 was performed for 2 h or 30 min , respectively , at room temperature . The calmodulin antibody was depleted of antibodies against chitin by passage over a chitin afﬁnity column for use in immuno - ﬂuorescence experiments . Brieﬂy , 15 ml packed chitin particles were washed with 100 ml CMF - PBS ( 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 1 . 5 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 8 . 1 mM KH 2 PO 4 ) followed by 100 ml CMF - PBS 1 0 . 4 M NaCl , 100 ml 0 . 1 M HCl , and 400 ml CMF - PBS . The calmodulin antibody was loaded onto the column followed by washing with CMF - PBS . A 15 - ml fraction corresponding to the void volume of the column was collected . Flow - through fractions in CMF - PBS were collected and used for immunolocalization of calmodulin in a dilu - tion of 1 : 100 in PEMBAL . For the background control , the puriﬁed calmodulin antibody was preabsorbed with 60 m g recombinant GST - calmodulin from E . coli . Labeling of actin with rhodamine – phalloidin was performed as described ( Be´ne´detti et al . , 1994 ) . To preserve the GFP signal , sorbi - tol was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 M , and the pH was adjusted to 7 . 5 during the preﬁxation and ﬁxation processes . Table 2 .

Cells were collected by centrifugation , resuspended in 1 3 PBS ( 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 3 . 19 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 . 67 mM KH 2 PO 4 ) , and mounted onto poly - l - lysine – treated slides . Cells were observed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with a 100 3 objective . Images were taken with a Zeiss camera coupled to a video system ( MWG Biotech , Ebersburg , Ger - many ) . Exposure times and other processing parameters were ad - justed to the signal strength of the sample . Latrunculin A Sensitivity Halo assays were used for determining latrunculin A sensitivity ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . Relative apparent sensitivities were calcu - lated according to Reneke et al . ( 1988 ) . a - Factor Uptake Assay 35 S a - factor uptake assays were performed as described ( Dulic et al . , 1991 ) . The samples were processed as described above . The inter - nalization rates were calculated as the percentage of counts inter - nalized per minute between 2 . 5 and 15 min . All uptake assays were performed at least twice . Two - Hybrid Techniques The interaction trap two - hybrid system was used ( Gyuris et al . , 1993 ) . The assay was performed as described ( Geli et al . , 1998 ) . The X - Gal plates ( 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl - b - d - galactopyranoside ) were supplied with the indicated concentration of calcium in the form of CaCl 2 . Pictures were taken after 1 d of growth at 37°C . Expression of all lexA - Arc35p fusion proteins was conﬁrmed by immunoblotting using the a - Arc35p - N antibody . Expression of the B42 - Cmd1p , B42 - Cmd1 – 226p , B42 - Cmd1 – 228p , B42 - Cmd1 – 239p , B42 - Cmd1 – 231p , and B42 - Cmd1 – 247p fusion proteins was con - ﬁrmed on total protein extractions of cultures grown in SD / Gal / Raff - Ura - His - Trp by immunoblotting using the calmodulin anti - body . All lexA fusions and B42 fusions were tested for their ability to activate transcription of the lacZ gene without the prey or bait , respectively . None of them was found to induce transcription sig - niﬁcantly . Native Protein Extracts and Coimmunoprecipitations Cells ( 2 3 10 9 ) were grown to a density of 1 3 10 7 cells / ml in YPUADT . Cells were collected by centrifugation , resuspended in 100 ml 0 . 1 M Tris - SO 4 , pH 9 . 4 , containing 28 mM 2 - mercaptoetha - nol , and incubated at 24°C for 30 min . Cells were collected by centrifugation , resuspended in 20 ml spheroplasting buffer ( 2 % yeast extract , 1 % peptone , 0 . 7 M sorbitol , 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 6 U lyticase ) , and incubated for 90 min at 24°C . Spheroplasts were collected , washed in 20 ml washing buffer ( 0 . 7 M sorbitol , 0 . 1 M NaCl , 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 5 mM MgCl 2 ) , resuspended in 1 ml lysis buffer ( 20 mM MES , pH 6 . 7 , 0 . 1 M NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM PMSF , 1 m g / ml each leupeptin , pepstatin , antipain ) supplemented with the indicated concentration of CaCl 2 , and dounce - lysed on ice with 40 strokes . Addition of a nonionic detergent such as Nonidet - P - 40 to the lysis buffer did not affect the results . The lysate was spun to remove cellular debris . The lysate ( 500 m l ) was added to the antibodies preabsorbed on protein A - Sepharose beads and incu - bated for 2 h at 4°C . The beads were subjected to three washes . The pellet was resuspended in 300 m l 125 mM Tris - HCl 6 . 8 , 2 % SDS , 0 . 1 M DTT , 30 % glycerol , 5 % b - mercaptoethanol , and bromophenol blue , boiled for 5 min , centrifuged for 5 min , and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . The supernatant from the antibody incubation was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in 300 m l as described for the pellet . Fifty microliters of each pellet and super - natant were loaded onto the gel . RESULTS Arc35p Is Required for Endocytosis and Organization of the Actin Cytoskeleton The END9 gene has been identiﬁed in a screen for endocytosis - deﬁcient mutants ( Munn and Riezman , 1994 ) . END9 was found to be identical to ARC35 , which encodes the 35 - kDa subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Winter et al . , 1997 ) . Genetic analysis has revealed that the ARC35 gene is essential for cell viability . Dissection of a diploid strain in which one allele of ARC35 was replaced with the URA3 marker ( RH2962 ) resulted in a 2 : 2 ( viable / dead ) spore segregation . Eighteen tetrads gave two viable spores , and two tetrads gave only one viable spore . All of the viable spores were ura3 , indicating that deletion of ARC35 in our strain background is lethal ( our unpublished results ) . A ts strain carrying the arc35 - 1 mutation is viable at 24°C but undergoes growth arrest after temperature shift to 37°C ( see Figure 4B , sector A ) . Sequencing of the genomic copy of arc35 - 1 revealed two mutations . Nucleotide 1023 was changed from C to T , resulting in a silent mutation in Val 341 , and nucleotide 1024 was changed from T to G , resulting in replacement of Tyr 342 by Asp . The arc35 - 1 mutant was shown to be impaired in the internalization of radiolabeled a - factor after a preincubation of 15 min at 37°C ( Munn and Riezman , 1994 ) . We found that the mutant was already signiﬁcantly slowed down for en - docytosis at the permissive temperature of 24°C when com - pared with an isogenic wild - type ( Wt ) strain ( Figure 1A , Wt , 24°C and arc35 - 1 , 24°C ) . While initial internalization of a - factor still occurred in the mutant upon a 15 - min preincu - bation at 37°C ( Munn and Riezman , 1994 ) , a preincubation of 20 min abolished the internalization of a - factor almost completely ( Figure 1A , arc35 - 1 , 37°C ) . Under the same con - ditions , the isogenic Wt strain internalized a - factor with identical kinetics as at 24°C ( Figure 1A , Wt , 37°C ) . Because actin is required for endocytosis ( Ku¨bler and Riez - man , 1993 ) and mutations in the Arp2 / 3 complex lead to actin defects ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ; Winter et al . , 1997 , 1999 ) , we ex - amined the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in an arc35 - 1 strain . Wt and arc35 - 1 cells were stained for ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) at 24°C and after a preincubation of 3 h at 37°C ( Figure 2 ) . Microscopic inspection of the arc35 - 1 cultures at both 24°C ( Figure 2E ) and 37°C ( Figure 2G ) revealed that the mutant cells were considerably larger and more elongated than the Wt cells ( Figure 2 , A and C ) . Wt cells showed the expected actin stain - ing at both temperatures ( Figure 2 , B and D ) , with F - actin localizing predominantly to the sites of active cell growth ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ) . The arc35 - 1 mutant displayed mild defects in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton at both 24°C ( Figure 2F ) and 37°C ( Figure 2H ) . The most obvious defect was the presence of highly staining actin cables that followed the cell cortex in both mother and daughter cells . Actin patches were often mislocalized to the bud neck and were apparently clustered into aggregates as described for an arc35 D strain ( Winter et al . , 1999 ) . The actin defects for other mutants in the Arp2 / 3 complex contrast with that of arc35 - 1 in that no increased staining of the actin cables was observed ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ; Winter et al . , 1997 , 1999 ; our own obser - vation ) . This ﬁnding emphasizes the importance of the Arp2 / 3 complex in organization of the actin cytoskeleton and points to possibly different or multiple functions of the subunits in the process . C .

Riezman Molecular Biology of the Cell 1116 Arc35 - GFP Colocalizes with Filamentous Actin Both Arp2 ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ) and Arp3 ( Winter et al . , 1997 ) have been localized to actin patches . Because Arc35p be - longs to the same complex and exhibits an actin defect , we determined the localization of Arc35p . Because our a - Arc35p antibodies failed to recognize the protein in ﬁxed cells ( our unpublished results ) , we integrated an Arc35 - GFP chimera at the ARC35 locus . The chimeric protein was fully Figure 1 . Overexpression of calmodulin and distinct calmod - ulin mutant alleles restores en - docytosis in arc35 - 1 .

The results are presented as the percentage of radioactive a - factor internal - ized per minute during the lin - ear range of the uptake reaction . Endocytic Function of Arc35p Vol . 11 , April 2000 1117 functional based on cell morphology , F - actin stainings ( Fig - ure 3A ) , and endocytosis assays ( our unpublished results ) . Arc35 - GFP localized predominantly to sites of active growth in a Wt background ( Figure 3A ) with some cortical staining visible in the mother cell . Arc35 - GFP ﬂuorescence was not observed on cable - like structures . To test for colocalization of actin and Arc35p , an Arc35 - GFP – expressing strain was stained to visualize F - actin ( Figure 3B ) . Although integrity of the actin cytoskeleton was affected by the use of sorbitol during ﬁxation to preserve Arc35 - GFP , the signal from Arc35 - GFP was found to overlap nicely with the staining of F - actin for all visible actin patches . Because the cables were lost when using this special ﬁxation protocol , it was impos - sible to determine localization of Arc35 - GFP to those struc - tures . Overexpression of Calmodulin Restores Growth of arc35 – 1 at 37°C Because the arc35 – 1 mutant exhibited defects in actin orga - nization , in endocytosis , and in nuclear division ( Schaerer - Brodbeck and Riezman , 2000 ) , analogous to cmd1 mutants , we wanted to test for a potential genetic interaction between Arc35p and Cmd1p . We found that overexpression of Cmd1p rescued the growth defect of arc35 – 1 at 37°C ( Figure 4B , sector B ) . Growth of the Wt control strain was not affected by overexpression of Cmd1p at any temperature ( Figure 4A ) . No suppression of the ts growth of various cmd1 mutants was observed upon overexpression of Arc35p ( our unpublished results ) . Intragenic complementation studies of ts cmd1 mutants have revealed at least four distinct , essential cellular func - tions for calmodulin ( Ohya and Botstein , 1994 ) . For a summary of the ts cmd1 mutant phenotypes , see Table 3 . Class A mutants ( e . g . , cmd1 - 226 ) are defective in the or - ganization of the actin cytoskeleton . Class B mutants ( cmd1 - 228 ) mislocalize calmodulin . Class C mutants ( cmd1 - 239 ) are defective for establishment / elongation of the nuclear spindle , and class D mutants ( cmd1 - 231 ) do not form a bud . In addition , calmodulin performs at least two different functions in endocytosis ( Geli et al . , 1998 ) . Figure 2 . Defective actin organization in arc35 - 1 cells . Wt ( RH2877 ) and arc35 - 1 ( RH3429 ) strains were preincubated for 3 h at either 24 or 37°C , ﬁxed , stained with rhodamine – phalloidin , and visualized either by Nomarski optics or by epiﬂuorescence . Shown are the Wt strain at 24°C ( A , B ) and 37°C ( C , D ) and the arc35 - 1 strain at 24°C ( E , F ) and 37°C ( G , H ) , respectively . Bar , 5 m m . C . Schaerer - Brodbeck and H . Riezman Molecular Biology of the Cell 1118 One function , affected by the cmd1 - 247 mutation and re - ferred to as the Cmd1 - 247 pathway , acts through the type I myosins . The other function , impaired by the cmd1 - 228 mutation and referred to as the Cmd1 - 228 pathway , oper - ates via an unknown target . The cmd1 - 226 mutation affects both endocytic functions of calmodulin . To examine ge - netically which of the functions of Cmd1p Arc35p inter - acts with , Wt and arc35 - 1 mutant cells were transformed with a series of high - copy plasmids expressing the ts cmd1 alleles described above . All of the resulting strains were tested for growth at 37°C . Overexpression of the mutant alleles did not affect growth of the Wt control strain at either 24 or 37°C ( Figure 4A ) . The ts growth of arc35 - 1 ( Figure 4B , sector A ) could be suppressed by overexpres - sion of Cmd1 - 226p ( panel C ) , Cmd1 - 231p ( panel F ) , or Cmd1 - 247p ( panel G ) . Overexpression of neither Cmd1 - 228p ( panel D ) nor Cmd1 - 239p ( panel E ) could restore growth at 37°C to arc35 – 1 . The lack of suppression by the B and C class calmodulin mutants ( for a summary of the data , see Table 4 ) indicates that Arc35p may share two functions with calmodulin , calmodulin localization ( Cmd1 - 228 pathway ) and nuclear division ( Cmd1 - 239 pathway ) . At least one of the functions of Arc35p may be calcium - dependent because overexpression of Cmd1 - 3p , which is defective for calcium binding in vitro ( Geiser et al . , 1991 ) , did not compensate for loss of Arc35p activity ( Figure 4B , panel H ) . Moreover , a genetic interaction be - tween ARC35 and CMD1 was conﬁrmed in crosses . An arc35 - 1 mutant was crossed to cmd1 - 3 , cmd1 - 226 , cmd1 - 228 , cmd1 - 239 , cmd1 - 231 , or cmd1 - 247 strains . The resulting diploids were sporulated , and tetrads were dissected . No double mutants between arc35 - 1 and cmd1 - 3 , cmd1 - 228 , or cmd1 - 239 were obtained , indicating a synthetic lethal in - teraction ( our unpublished results ) . This correlates well with the suppression of ts growth data . Interestingly , the ts growth of an arp2 - 1 strain ( Figure 4C ) or an arp3 - 1 strain ( our unpublished results ) was not sup - pressed by overexpression of calmodulin or selected mutant Figure 3 .

This suggests that the genetic interac - tion observed between the Arp2 / 3 complex and Cmd1p could be unique to Arc35p . Overexpression of Cmd1p and Distinct Cmd1 Mutant Proteins Restores Endocytosis in arc35 - 1 We wanted to determine whether overexpression of Cmd1p suppresses the endocytic defect of arc35 - 1 . A Wt and arc35 - 1 strain expressing Cmd1p were assayed for receptor - medi - ated endocytosis after a preincubation of 20 min at 37°C ( Figure 1A ) . Overexpression of Cmd1p reduced the internal - ization kinetics slightly in a Wt background . In the arc35 - 1 background , the endocytic rate was increased to ; 80 % of Wt levels upon overexpression of Cmd1p if compared with the mutant strain without plasmid . The collection of ts cmd1 alleles was assayed for their ability to restore endocytosis in arc35 - 1 at 37°C upon over - expression ( Figure 1B ) . None of the mutant alleles was found to decrease the internalization rate more than Cmd1p upon overexpression in a Wt background . This allowed a direct comparison of the internalization rates observed for the different arc35 - 1 strains . Overexpression of Cmd1 - 239p ( nuclear defect ) , Cmd1 - 231p ( bud emergence ) , or Cmd1 - 247p ( myosin endocytic function ) restored endocytosis in arc35 - 1 to almost Wt level as observed for overexpression of Cmd1p . Overexpression of Cmd1 - 226p or Cmd1 - 228p did not improve the internalization kinetics . Overexpression of Cmd1 - 3p restored endocytosis to 50 % of the Wt level . The data ( for a summary , see Table 4 ) suggest that Arc35p shares speciﬁcally one endocytic function with Cmd1p , namely the Cmd1 - 228 but not the Cmd1 - 247 pathway . An involvement of other subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex in endocytosis has been demonstrated previously ( Moreau et al . , 1997 ) . We found that the ts arp2 - 1 strain , which fails to internalize uracil permease ( Moreau et al . , 1997 ) , showed a reduced rate of a - factor internalization already at the per - missive temperature ( Figure 1B , arp2 - 1 , 24°C ) . The internal - ization rate decreased further upon a 20 min preincubation at 37°C ( arp2 - 1 , 37°C ) . Overexpression of calmodulin did not improve the internalization kinetics . This points to different defects affecting endocytosis in mutants of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex and is in good correlation with the ﬁndings for the actin defects of the different mutants . The Same Calmodulin Mutant Proteins that Restore Endocytosis Suppress the Actin Defect of arc35 - 1 It has been shown that defects in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton result frequently in increased or decreased sensi - tivity to the actin depolymerizing drug latA ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . We found that the arc35 - 1 mutation leads to almost twofold sensitivity to latA at 24°C if compared with a Wt control ( Figure 5B ; Wt 1 pASZ12 , arc35 - 1 1 pASZ12 ) . Overex - pression of Cmd1p in arc35 - 1 resulted in a restoration of Wt sensitivity to latA ( Figure 5B ) . In support of the idea that latA sensitivity is a measure of integrity of the actin cytoskeleton , the actin cytoskeleton of an arc35 - 1 strain expressing Cmd1p was found to be properly organized at 37°C ( Figure 5A , panel c ; compare with arc35 - 1 at the same temperature in panel a ) . In contrast to overexpression of Wt Cmd1p ( Figure 5A , panel d ) , overexpression of most other ts cmd1 alleles in Figure 4 . Suppression of arc35 - 1 ts growth by calmodulin . Wt ( RH2877 ) ( A ) , arc35 - 1 ( RH3429 ) ( B ) , and arp2 - 1 ( RH4164 ) ( C ) strains were transformed with the following plasmids : ( A ) pASZ12 , ( B ) pCMD1 , ( C ) pASZ12 : : cmd1 - 226 ( actin ) , ( D ) pASZ12 : : cmd1 - 228 ( cal - modulin mislocalized ) , ( E ) pASZ12 : : cmd1 - 239 ( nuclear defect ) , ( F ) pASZ12 : : cmd1 - 231 ( bud emergence ) , ( G ) pASZ12 : : cmd1 - 247 ( endo - cytosis ) , ( H ) pASZ12 : : cmd1 - 3 ( calcium binding ) . The strains were grown on glucose - selective medium for 3 d at 24°C and for 2 d at 37°C . Table 3 .

Riezman Molecular Biology of the Cell 1120 arc35 - 1 did not restore Wt morphology ( Schaerer - Brodbeck and Riezman , 2000 ) . We have shown previously that over - expression of Cmd1 - 228p did not restore proper actin local - ization in arc35 - 1 cells , whereas high doses of Cmd1 - 239p did ( Schaerer - Brodbeck and Riezman , 2000 ) ; however , it may be misleading to draw any conclusions concerning restoration of the actin integrity in mutant cells with an abnormal morphology . Therefore , we determined sensitivity to latA of arc35 - 1 strains overexpressing the collection of ts cmd1 alleles as a measure for integrity of the actin cytoskel - eton . Overexpression of any of the ts alleles , except for Cmd1 - 3p , did not alter the sensitivity of a Wt strain to latA ( Figure 5B ) . Overexpression of Cmd1 - 3p increased the sen - sitivity of the Wt strain to latA 1 . 3 - fold . Overexpression of Cmd1 - 239p , Cmd1 - 231p , or Cmd1 - 247p in arc35 - 1 restored latA sensitivity to Wt values ( Figure 5B ) . Overexpression of Cmd1 - 228p did not decrease the sensitivity of arc35 - 1 to latA , whereas overexpression of Cmd1 - 226p increased the sensitivity of arc35 - 1 to latA . Overexpression of Cmd1 - 3p ( calcium binding ) resulted in some reduction of sensitivity Table 4 .

Endocytic Function of Arc35p Vol . 11 , April 2000 1121 of arc35 - 1 to latA , although the suppression was not com - plete . It is striking that calmodulin mutant proteins that cannot suppress the endocytic defect of arc35 - 1 cannot sup - press the increased sensitivity to latA either . Arc35p Is Required to Localize Calmodulin to Sites of Active Growth The pathway affected by cmd1 - 228 is required to localize calmodulin to the sites of active growth . Because the endo - cytic defect in an arc35 - 1 mutant is most likely linked to the Cmd1 - 228 function , we determined the intracellular localiza - tion of Cmd1p in an arc35 - 1 mutant at the restrictive tem - perature . Wt and arc35 - 1 strains were processed for immu - noﬂuorescence with the a - Cmd1p antibody after various time intervals at 37°C ( Figure 6 ) . The Wt strain showed localization of calmodulin to the sites of active growth at 24°C as described previously ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . After the shift to 37°C , calmodulin underwent a transient relocal - ization to the cytoplasm . Recovery of cortical calmodulin localization began 30 min after the shift and was completed after 1 h at 37°C . To conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of the observed signal , the Wt strain was stained with calmodulin antibody that had been preabsorbed with recombinant calmodulin ( PA ) . The ﬂuorescent images revealed that the signal ob - served was due to calmodulin . In arc35 - 1 mutant cells , Cmd1p was mainly localized to the sites of active growth , although increased cytoplasmic staining was observed ( Figure 6 , arc35 - 1 , 24°C ) . Staining of calmodulin at sites of active growth disappeared completely upon shift for 10 min to 37°C as in Wt cells . In contrast to Wt cells , a relocalization of calmodulin to sites of active growth was not seen in the arc35 - 1 mutant at 37°C . In contrast , no mislocalization of Arc35 - GFP in any of the ts cmd1 mutants was observed ( our unpublished results ) , indicating that Arc35p localization does not depend on Cmd1p . It should be considered that the observed mislocalization of Cmd1p in arc35 - 1 cells on shift to 37°C could be caused by misorganization of the actin cytoskeleton . To address this question , Cmd1p localization was analyzed in arp2 and arp3 mutants , which fail to organize the actin cytoskeleton prop - Figure 6 . Arc35p is required to localize calmodulin to the cortical sites . Wt ( RH2877 ) , arc35 - 1 ( RH3429 ) , arp2 - 1 ( RH4164 ) , and arp3 - 1 ( Y90 ) strains were grown at 24°C and then shifted to 37°C for 10 , 30 , or 60 min before ﬁxation and staining for calmodulin by indirect immunoﬂuorescence . The staining obtained using preabsorbed a - calmodulin antibody is also shown ( PA ) . Bar , 5 m m . C . Schaerer - Brodbeck and H . Riezman Molecular Biology of the Cell 1122 erly at 37°C ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ; our own observation ) . At 24°C , both mutants localized Cmd1p to the sites of active growth ( Figure 6 ) . A short shift to 37°C caused mislocaliza - tion of Cmd1p to the cytoplasm as observed for Wt and arc35 - 1 cells . In contrast to the arc35 - 1 mutant , recovery of cortical calmodulin was observed in arp2 and arp3 mutants within 1 h at 37°C . Although the kinetics of recovery was slightly decreased when compared with Wt , disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by the arp2 - 1 and arp3 - 1 mutations did not affect the long - term localization of Cmd1p . It is therefore unlikely that the mislocalization of Cmd1p observed in arc35 - 1 cells is caused by the failure to organize the actin cytoskeleton properly . These data suggest that Arc35p is required to localize calmodulin to the sites of active growth . Arc35p Interacts Speciﬁcally with Cmd1p The data presented suggest a role for Arc35p as a regulator of calmodulin localization and probably function . We there - fore investigated a possible physical interaction between Arc35p and Cmd1p with the two - hybrid system and coim - munoprecipitations . For the analysis with the yeast two - hybrid system , ARC35 and arc35 - 1 were used as baits ( pEG series ) , and CMD1 and the collection of ts cmd1 mutant were used as prey ( pJG series ) . b - Galactosidase activity indicative of interaction was monitored at 37°C on X - Gal – enriched plates containing no calcium or 5 mM calcium . Strong b - ga - lactosidase activity was detected in the strain bearing the ARC35 bait and CMD1 prey on plates with 5 mM calcium ( Figure 7 ) . The observation that only some ts cmd1 alleles are capable of suppressing the ts growth and / or the endocytic defect of the arc35 - 1 strain prompted us to determine the interaction proﬁle of Arc35p with the same calmodulin mutants ( Figure 7 ) . Strong b - galactosidase activity was detected in the strains bearing the ARC35 bait and either the cmd1 - 231 or cmd1 - 247 prey . Strains bearing the ARC35 bait and the cmd1 - 226 , cmd1 - 228 , or cmd1 - 239 preys did not show detectable b - galactosi - dase activity . These data ( for a summary , see Table 4 ) sup - port the hypothesis that Arc35p exerts its functions via the pathways affected by cmd1 - 226 / 228 and cmd1 - 239 alleles . No interaction was monitored in a strain expressing the ARC35 bait and the cmd1 - 3 prey , indicating Ca 2 1 - dependent bind - ing . b - galactosidase activity was not observed with the cmd1 preys when the ARC35 bait was replaced with arc35 - 1 as a bait , showing that functional Arc35p is required for this interaction . The strain bearing the Drosophila bicoid protein as a control for the speciﬁcity of the assay did not show any signiﬁcant interaction . To conﬁrm the interaction seen in the two - hybrid interac - tion trap , an extract of Wt cells was used for immunopre - cipitations with the a - calmodulin antiserum in the presence or absence of 5 mM calcium . The immunoprecipitates ( P ) and supernatants ( S ) were assayed for Arc35p and Cmd1p content by immunoblotting . Arc35p was recovered signiﬁ - cantly in the immunoprecipitates using Cmd1p antibody ( a - Cmd1p ) for immunoprecipitation in the presence of 5 mM calcium ( Figure 8 ) . No recovery was detected without calcium . At 5 mM calcium , no Arc35p was recovered in the immunoprecipitates when protein A - Sepharose ( prot . A ) or preimmune serum ( preimm . ) was used for immunoprecipi - tation , conﬁrming the speciﬁcity of the interaction . Because Figure 7 . Two - hybrid interaction between Arc35p and Cmd1p . ARC35 and arc35 - 1 were cloned in frame to the lexA DNA binding domain of pEG202 . CMD1 and the collection of ts cmd1 alleles were cloned in frame behind the B42 transactivation domain of pJG4 - 5 . b - Galactosidase activity indicative of interaction was monitored on X - Gal plates at 37°C supplemented with no calcium or 5 mM calcium . Figure 8 . Coimmunoprecipitation of Arc35p and Cmd1p . ( A ) To assess the speciﬁcity of the Arc35p antibody , Wt cells expressing either endogenous Arc35p or overexpressing Arc35p ( RH2877 1 pASZ12 : : ARC35 ) were grown in selective medium and harvested , and proteins were extracted . The extracts were immuno - blotted for Arc35p and Cmd1p as a loading control . ( B ) A Wt strain ( RH2877 ) was grown to logarithmic phase and harvested . Total and native protein extracts were prepared . Protein A - Sepharose ( prot . A ) , protein A - Sepharose bound to preimmune serum ( preimm . ) , or protein A - Sepharose bound to a - Cmd1p serum ( a - Cmd1p ) was used for immunoprecipitation of native cell extracts in the presence of no calcium or 5 mM calcium . Immunoprecipitates ( P ) and super - natants ( S ) were immunoblotted for Arc35p , Cmd1p , or Act1p with a - Arc35p - N , a - Cmd1p , or a - actin antibodies . Endocytic Function of Arc35p Vol . 11 , April 2000 1123 the interaction between Arc35p and Cmd1p could be medi - ated by ﬁlamentous actin , the immunoprecipitates and su - pernatants were assayed for the actin content as well ( Figure 8 ) . Actin was found to precipitate nonspeciﬁcally in all con - trol reactions where no Arc35p could be recovered in the immunopellets . It is therefore unlikely that ﬁlamentous actin mediates the observed interaction . Unlike experiments with the two - hybrid system , a strain expressing Cmd1 - 3p could not be used for an independent conﬁrmation of the calcium dependence of the observed interaction because Cmd1 - 3p is not recognized by our antibody ( our unpublished results ) . DISCUSSION The Arp2 / 3 complex is involved in the organization and integrity of the cortical actin cytoskeleton ( Zigmond , 1998 ; for review , see Machesky and Gould , 1999 ) . Analysis of an arc35 - 1 ( ts ) mutant , defective in a relatively uncharacterized component of the complex , also revealed defects in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton . The mutant displayed exaggerated actin cables along the mother – daughter cell axis , and F - actin aggregates localized predominantly in the bud neck . Although accumulation of F - actin aggregates has been demonstrated for arp2 ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ) and arp3 ( Winter et al . , 1997 ) mutants , an increase in actin cable stain - ing has not been seen in arp2 / 3 mutants . The phenotype of arc35 - 1 suggests a role for the Arp2 / 3 complex , not only in actin polymerization ( Welch et al . , 1998 ) but also in dynam - ics of actin cables . Suppression of arc35 - 1 by Calmodulin We have shown that overexpression of calmodulin can sup - press the ts growth , the endocytic defect , and the actin defect of the arc35 - 1 mutant . This suppression was speciﬁc to arc35 - 1 and was not observed for arp2 - 1 or arp3 - 1 . The un - usual actin defect of arc35 - 1 compared with other mutants in the Arp2 / 3 complex and the unique genetic interaction ob - served between Arc35p and Cmd1p suggest that Arc35p may regulate some aspects of F - actin dynamics via calmod - ulin and that its function may be different from other sub - units of the complex ; however , we cannot rule out that the differences we see between mutants in the Arp2 / 3 complex are due to the speciﬁc alleles rather than individual func - tions of the subunits . We observed that overexpression of cmd1 alleles that do not affect endocytosis restored normal actin staining and endocytosis in the arc35 - 1 mutant . Overexpression of Cmd1 - 3p , which does not bind calcium ( Geiser et al . , 1991 ) , could only partially suppress the endocytic and actin defect of arc35 - 1 , although a ts cmd1 – 3 strain internalizes a - factor with Wt kinetics ( Ku¨bler et al . , 1994 ) . On the other hand , overexpression of two cmd1 alleles that affect endocytosis , cmd1 - 226 and cmd1 - 228 , could not restore the actin and endocytic defects , whereas overexpression of another allele , cmd1 - 247 , could . For a summary of the suppression data , see Table 4 . These data are consistent with the previous hypoth - esis ( Geli et al . , 1998 ) that calmodulin plays at least two roles in endocytosis . One role is to regulate the type I myosin , and this function is affected by the cmd1 - 247 and cmd1 - 226 mu - tations . The target of the second function , which is affected by the cmd1 - 226 and cmd1 - 228 mutations , is still unknown . Our data would suggest that Arc35p is required for actin organization and endocytosis and that it is associated with the Cmd1 - 228 function of calmodulin . Thus , it is likely that the endocytic function deﬁned by the arc35 - 1 mutation is independent of the type I myosins . One striking observation is that both the cmd1 - 228 and arc35 - 1 mutants mislocalize cortical calmodulin after shift to the restrictive temperature . For other mutants in the Arp2 / 3 complex , recovery of cortical calmodulin after a shift to the restrictive temperature was observed , albeit with slower kinetics than in the Wt control strain . Because both arc35 - 1 and cmd1 - 228 mislocalize calmodulin and are defective for receptor - mediated endocytosis as well , it is tempting to speculate that the endocytic function of Arc35p is to localize cortical calmodulin . The endocytic defect could be a direct consequence of the mislocalization of calmodulin in the arc35 - 1 strain . One line of evidence argues against this sim - ple model . In Wt cells , after short times of temperature shift to 37°C ( up to 30 min ) , calmodulin is transiently localized to the cytoplasm . At the same time , endocytosis occurs with normal kinetics . We therefore postulate that Arc35p is not only required for localizing calmodulin cortically , but could be required for interaction of calmodulin with the target of the Cmd1 - 228 function . Prolonged incubation at 37°C results in localization of Cmd1p back to the cortical sites in Wt cells . It is possible that during this time at 37°C in which wild - type cells recover calmodulin localization , the target of the Cmd1 - 228 function remains in place ; however , in arc35 - 1 cells , calmodulin is never relocalized cortically , perhaps because of lack of interaction with Arc35 - 1p . As a consequence , the target of the Cmd1 - 228 function may become mislocalized or inactivated , which might be the cause of the endocytic defect in both the cmd1 - 228 and arc35 - 1 mutants . This idea is sup - ported by the observation that the endocytic defect of an arc35 - 1 strain is not immediate after a shift to restrictive temperature but requires 15 – 20 min preincubation . Overexpression of some calmodulin mutant proteins sup - pressed the ts growth phenotype of arc35 - 1 cells , whereas others , such as Cmd1 - 228p and Cmd1 - 239p , could not . In addition , overexpression of Cmd1 - 226p in arc35 - 1 restored growth at 37°C without restoring endocytosis or actin orga - nization . This indicates that the actin / endocytic defect of arc35 - 1 cells is not the only determinant of ts growth and suggests that Arc35p regulates another essential function through calmodulin . We have evidence that Arc35p is in - volved in spindle elongation during mitosis via a function affected by the cmd1 - 239 allele ( Schaerer - Brodbeck and Riez - man , 2000 ) . Arc35p Interacts with Calmodulin in a Calcium - dependent Manner We have characterized Arc35p as a regulator of Cmd1p localization and activity . Two - hybrid data showed that Arc35p interacts optimally with Cmd1p under conditions of 5 mM extracellular calcium . Consistent with the calcium stimulation is the fact that Arc35p – Cmd1 - 3p interaction was not detectable even with 5 mM extracellular calcium . This suggests that the calcium - binding domains of calmodulin loaded with calcium strengthen the interaction with Arc35p . Results using calmodulin mutant proteins in the two - hybrid assays showed that the interaction we detected is speciﬁc and most likely signiﬁcant for function .

Riezman Molecular Biology of the Cell 1124 proteins that could suppress the ts growth defect of arc35 - 1 ( Cmd1 - 231p , Cmd1 - 247p ) bound Arc35p strongly in the as - say , whereas ones that could not suppress the ts growth defect or the endocytic defect ( Cmd1 - 226p , Cmd1 - 228p , Cmd1 - 239p ) did not . Coimmunoprecipitation assays were in entire agreement with the two - hybrid studies and indicate that Arc35p and Cmd1p can be found together in a protein complex . In addition , our data suggest that the interaction observed may not be mediated through ﬁlamentous actin . This is the ﬁrst suggestion of complex formation between these two important players in regulation of the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton . We cannot determine from these experiments whether the interaction of the two proteins is direct or through other proteins . The internalization step of endocytosis in yeast has been shown to require calmodulin , but apparently the calcium binding capacity of calmodulin is not essential for this cal - modulin function because cmd1 - 3 mutant cells do not show a strong endocytic defect ( Ku¨bler et al . , 1994 ) . On the other hand , we show here that calcium is needed to detect an interaction between Cmd1p and Arc35p , two proteins re - quired for endocytosis . One possibility to explain this is if the interaction between the two proteins would be dynamic and calcium ions would favor the state in which the two proteins interact . This would allow detection of a stable complex in vitro . In vivo a transient interaction without calcium could be sufﬁcient for endocytic function . In summary , the data presented show that Arc35p is required for endocytosis and provide evidence that its en - docytic function is mediated through actin and calmodulin . This major point is supported by multiple genetic interac - tions as well as a physical association between Arc35p and Cmd1p . Calmodulin has two functions in endocytosis . One of these is associated with the type I myosin and is not affected in the arc35 - 1 mutant . The other calmodulin func - tion , characterized by the cmd1 - 228 allele , is affected in the arc35 - 1 mutant . For the moment , it seems that this novel calmodulin - dependent function of the Arp2 / 3 complex is mediated by the Arc35p subunit ; however , our studies do not address the question of whether this function of Arc35p requires association with other subunits of the complex .
