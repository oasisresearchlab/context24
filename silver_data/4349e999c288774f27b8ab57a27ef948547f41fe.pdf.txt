658 Research Article Introduction IQGAP1 ( Weissbach et al . , 1998 ) is an ~ 380 kDa homodimeric protein ( Bashour et al . , 1997 ) that is widely expressed among vertebrate cell types from early embryogenesis ( Cupit et al . , 2004 ; Yamashiro et al . , 2003 ) through adulthood ( Bashour et al . , 1997 ; Takemoto et al . , 2001 ; Yamaoka - Tojo et al . , 2004 ; Zhou et al . , 2003 ) . Several sequentially arranged functional domains enable IQGAP1 to bind directly to a rich spectrum of cytoskeletal , adhesion and regulatory proteins ( Briggs and Sacks , 2003 ; Mateer and Bloom , 2003 ) , including F - actin ( Bashour et al . , 1997 ; Fukata et al . , 1997 ) , the microtubule plus end capping protein , CLIP - 170 ( Fukata et al . , 2002 ) , E - cadherin ( Kuroda et al . , 1998 ) , (cid:2) - catenin ( Kuroda et al . , 1998 ) , activated forms of the small G proteins , Cdc42 and Rac1 ( Hart et al . , 1996 ; Kuroda et al . , 1996 ) , calmodulin ( Mateer et al . , 2002 ) , MAP kinases ( Roy et al . , 2004 ; Roy et al . , 2005 ) , the tumor suppressor protein , APC ( Watanabe et al . , 2004 ) , and VEGFR2 , the type 2 receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor , or VEGF ( Yamaoka - Tojo et al . , 2004 ) . Like many of its associating proteins , IQGAP1 preferentially accumulates in the cell cortex , where it is most concentrated at actin filament - rich sites , such as lamellipodia and cell - cell junctions ( Bashour et al . , 1997 ; Hart et al . , 1996 ; Kuroda et al . , 1998 ; Yamashiro et al . , 2003 ) . Regulation of cell motility and morphogenesis are among the most conspicuous cell biological functions of IQGAP1 . The principal evidence for this conclusion is that siRNA - mediated knockdown of IQGAP1 potently inhibited cell motility ( Mataraza et al . , 2003 ; Yamaoka - Tojo et al . , 2004 ) , whereas cell migration ( Mataraza et al . , 2003 ) and neurite outgrowth ( Li et al . , 2005 ) were enhanced in cells overexpressing IQGAP1 . Regulation of cell motility upstream of IQGAP1 has not been widely explored , but IQGAP1 - dependent motility of endothelial cells was found to be triggered by binding of VEGF to VEGFR2 , and subsequent recruitment of IQGAP1 to the cytoplasmic tail of VEGFR2 ( Yamaoka - Tojo et al . , 2004 ) . Binding of a specific extracellular ligand to its cognate cell surface receptor thus represents at least one mechanism by which IQGAP1 can promote cell motility . Knowledge of the downstream pathways by which IQGAP1 regulates cell motility has remained equally limited . One possible mechanism involves IQGAP1 - dependent regulation of intercellular adhesion . IQGAP1 has been reported to inhibit cell - cell adhesion by binding to E - cadherin and (cid:2) - catenin , thereby blocking interaction of (cid:2) - catenin with (cid:3) - catenin and uncoupling the adhesion machinery from the actin cystoskelelon ( Kuroda et al . , 1998 ) . This inhibition of cell - cell adhesion by IQGAP1 can be overcome by binding of GTP - Cdc42 or GTP - Rac1 to IQGAP1 , which dissociates IQGAP1 from E - cadherin and (cid:2) - catenin ( Fukata et al . , 1999 ) . At least one other potential explanation for the role of IQGAP1 in cell motility is well worth considering . The direct binding of IQGAP1 to F - actin in vitro ( Bashour et al . , 1997 ; Fukata et al . , IQGAP1 has been implicated as a regulator of cell motility because its overexpression or underexpression stimulates or inhibits cell migration , respectively , but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood . Here , we present evidence that IQGAP1 stimulates branched actin filament assembly , which provides the force for lamellipodial protrusion , and that this function of IQGAP1 is regulated by binding of type 2 fibroblast growth factor ( FGF2 ) to a cognate receptor , FGFR1 . Stimulation of serum - starved MDBK cells with FGF2 promoted IQGAP1 - dependent lamellipodial protrusion and cell migration , and intracellular associations of IQGAP1 with FGFR1 – and two other factors – the Arp2 / 3 complex and its activator N - WASP , that coordinately promote nucleation of branched actin filament networks . FGF2 also induced recruitment of IQGAP1 , FGFR1 , N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 complex to lamellipodia . N - WASP was also required for FGF2 - stimulated migration of MDBK cells . In vitro , IQGAP1 bound directly to the cytoplasmic tail of FGFR1 and to N - WASP , and stimulated branched actin filament nucleation in the presence of N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex . Based on these observations , we conclude that IQGAP1 links FGF2 signaling to Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent actin assembly by serving as a binding partner for FGFR1 and as an activator of N - WASP .

The force for lamellipodial protrusion , and by extension , cell motility , is provided by assembly of branched actin filament networks at the leading edges of motile cells . Assembly of these networks is thought to involve the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ) to nucleate new filaments from the sides of pre - existing filaments , and activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex , such as neural Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) , WASP and the WAVE proteins , which themselves require activation by additional factors ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . The study described here employed a combination of cell biological , biochemical and biophysical approaches to determine if regulation of cortical actin assembly by IQGAP1 underlies its critical role in cell motility . We demonstrate that IQGAP1 is part of the molecular machinery that stimulates branched actin filament nucleation and lamellipodial protrusion , and present evidence that activation of growth factor receptors is a common mechanism to engage this function of IQGAP1 . Furthermore , because numerous proteins involved in promoting branched actin filament assembly failed to accumulate at the cell surface following receptor activation of IQGAP1 - depleted cells , our results suggest that IQGAP1 coordinates the recruitment and activation of these proteins at the leading edge of motile cells . Results FGF2 stimulates cell motility through IQGAP1 To test the hypothesis that IQGAP1 regulates actin filament dynamics in response to activation of cell surface receptors other than VEGFR2 , we began by examining motility of Madin - Darby bovine kidney ( MDBK ) cells stimulated with fibroblast growth factor 2 ( FGF2 ) . We chose FGF2 for this study because one of its principal receptors is FGFR1 , whose cytoplasmic domain contains a region with 55 % amino acid identity to the IQGAP1 - binding region of VEGFR2 ( Yamaoka - Tojo et al . , 2004 ) . Cell motility was induced in serum - starved MDBK cells by FGF2 , and found to be tightly coupled to IQGAP1 expression . Wounds were scraped into confluent monolayers of serum - starved cells that had been treated with siRNA to reduce IQGAP1 protein levels to ~ 20 % of normal ( Fig . 1A ) and FGF2 was added to the cultures 2 hours later . As shown by phase contrast microscopy in Fig . 1B ( also see Fig . 5C for quantification ) , within 7 hours after introduction of FGF2 , nearly full wound closure was observed in control cultures treated with scrambled RNA ( scrRNA ) , but wounds scraped in confluent cultures of IQGAP1 - depleted cells closed only partially . Most wound closure in control cultures was dependent on FGF2 , because broad wounds persisted for more than 24 hours in cultures that were not stimulated with FGF2 . We thus conclude that FGF2 stimulates migration of MDBK cells through a pathway that requires IQGAP1 . The impaired ability of IQGAP1 - depleted cells to migrate in the wound healing assay resulted from a dramatic inhibition of FGF2 - stimulated lamellipodial dynamics . Cells that had been treated with IQGAP1 siRNA or scrRNA were subcultured at low density , allowed to attach and spread on coverslips in serum - containing medium overnight , transferred to serum - free medium for 18 hours , and finally stimulated with FGF2 . Images of individual cells that were not in direct contact with any neighboring cells were recorded by time - lapse , phase contrast microscopy before and after FGF2 stimulation . Timelines of lamellipodial protrusion and retraction were displayed as kymographs ( Hinz et al . , 1999 ) , which facilitated visual and quantitative comparisons of lamellipodial behavior in cells containing normal versus diminished levels of IQGAP1 . Typical kymographs are shown in Fig . 2A . The control cell kymograph demonstrated a high density of sharp , steadily advancing narrow peaks , each of which represented a rapid cycle of lamellipodial protrusion and retraction that resulted in net forward movement of the cell margin . By comparison , the kymograph of the IQGAP1 - depleted cell contained only a few , much broader peaks , and indicated little , if any advance of the cell margin . The impression obtained from this representative pair of kymographs was reinforced by quantitative analysis of three Fig . 1 . IQGAP1 is required for FGF2 - stimulated migration of MDBK cells . ( A ) MDBK cells were transfected with IQGAP1 - specific siRNA or scrambled RNA ( scrRNA ) using a Nucleofector . To allow direct visual comparison of IQGAP1 levels in the two samples by western blotting , a concentration series of each cell extract was analyzed at the indicated relative dilutions . Note that siRNA reduced the IQGAP1 level to ~ 20 % of normal , but had no effect on cellular actin content . ( B ) Confluent monolayers were then serum - starved for 8 hours , wounded with a micropipette tip , and 2 hours later were stimulated with 25 ng / ml FGF2 . Note that movement of IQGAP1 - depleted cells into the wound , as seen after 7 hours of FGF2 exposure , was severely impaired , and that broad wounds persisted for more than 24 hours after wounding in both scrRNA - treated and IQGAP1 - depleted cells that were not stimulated with FGF2 . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 660 distinct parameters of lamellipodial dynamics : the frequency of forming protrusions , the velocity with which protrusions advanced , and the persistence of protrusions ( Fig . 2B ; and for detailed statistics , including post - hoc comparisons , see supplementary material , Table S1 ) . Comparison of control and IQGAP1 - depleted cells prior to FGF2 stimulation indicated that their protrusion frequencies were indistinguishable , but that protrusions in control cells had a 34 % higher velocity and a 39 % lower persistence . After FGF2 stimulation , lamellipodial behavior was strikingly different between control and IQGAP1 - depleted cells . Addition of FGF2 to control cells caused protrusion frequency and velocity to increase by 224 % and 64 % , respectively , but protrusion persistence was unchanged . By contrast , addition of FGF2 to IQGAP1 - depleted cells did not change the frequency of protrusions or their velocity , but did cause protrusion persistence to increase by 105 % . Loss of IQGAP1 , therefore , potently inhibited the ability of FGF2 to induce protrusions and increase the speeds at which they Journal of Cell Science 120 ( 4 ) advanced , but caused protrusions that were able to form following FGF2 stimulation to be more long lasting . Despite this increased protrusion persistence , the net result of knocking down IQGAP1 was to prevent FGF2 from inducing productive protrusions . It is likely that the relatively inactive lamellipodia in IQGAP1 - deficient cells stimulated with FGF2 accounted for their reduced migration in wound healing assays ( Fig . 1B and Fig . 5C ) . FGF2 induces intracellular association of IQGAP1 with N - WASP , the Arp2 / 3 complex and FGFR1 Because waves of lamellipodial protrusion are associated with periods of actin assembly ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) , and IQGAP1 concentrates in lamellipodia and binds F - actin ( Bashour et al . , 1997 ) , we investigated whether proteins that regulate actin assembly associated with IQGAP1 after FGF2 stimulation . IQGAP1 was immunoprecipitated from low - density cultures containing islands of relatively small numbers of cells ( approximately 10 - 100 cells per island ) before FGF2 Fig . 2 . Reduced lamellipodial dynamics in IQGAP1 - depleted cells . Individual cells in sparse cultures that were serum - starved for 18 hours were imaged by phase contrast , time - lapse microscopy for 5 minutes before FGF2 was added to a final concentration of 25 ng / ml , and for 10 minutes thereafter . ( A ) Kymographic images ( right panels ) obtained from the indicated regions of interest ( roi ) at the margins of individual cells ( left panels ) treated with scrRNA or siRNA . Note how dynamic and motile the cell margin was in the control , scrRNA - treated cells compared to the cell depleted of IQGAP1 with siRNA . ( B ) Comparative responses of scrRNA - treated control ( – ) and IQGAP1 siRNA - treated ( + ) cells to FGF2 stimulation . The three parameters of lamellipodial dynamics that were measured before and after FGF2 stimulation were frequency , velocity and persistence of protrusion . The raw data were obtained from 180 regions of interest ( roi ) in 19 scrRNA - treated control cells , and from 180 roi in 21 siRNA - treated cells . Error bars indicate s . e . m . Differences between groups were analyzed using a one - way ANOVA test . Statistically significant differences at (cid:3) = 0 . 001 are indicated by * for control versus siRNA - treated cells after FGF2 exposure ( see supplementary material Table S1 for detailed statistics , including post - hoc comparisons ) . The net conclusion is that control cells , but not IQGAP1 - deficient cells , respond to FGF2 by making more dynamic lamellipodia . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 661 IQGAP1 links FGF to actin assembly stimulation and at various time points thereafter . As a control for non - specific immunoprecipitation , the tau - 1 an antibody to tau , which is not expressed in MDBK cells , was substituted for anti - IQGAP1 10 minutes after FGF2 stimulation . The IQGAP1 immunoprecipitates contained time - dependent increases in coimmunoprecipitated N - WASP , Arp3 and FGFR1 beginning as early as 10 minutes after FGF2 stimulation , but none of the proteins assayed by western blotting were immunoprecipitated by anti - tau ( Fig . 3A ) . Arp3 is a subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ) , which coordinates with N - WASP to assemble branched actin filament networks ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . WAVE2 , a different Arp2 / 3 complex activator that has been implicated specifically in lamellipodial protrusion ( Yamazaki et al . , 2003 ; Yan et al . , 2003 ) , was readily detectable in MDBK cell lysates by immunoblotting , but did not coimmunoprecipitate with IQGAP1 before or after FGF2 stimulation of serum - starved cells ( not shown ) . Using purified proteins for in vitro binding assays , we determined that IQGAP1 binds directly to the cytoplasmic domain of FGFR1 and to N - WASP , and acts as a bridge for indirect association of FGFR1 and N - WASP ( Fig . 3B and Fig . 8C ) . Low - density MDBK cultures were also stained by double fluorescence microscopy for IQGAP1 plus FGFR1 , N - WASP , Arp3 or F - actin . As shown in Fig . 4 , FGF2 induced recruitment of IQGAP1 and the other four proteins to lamellipodia , where they colocalized extensively . These results place IQGAP1 predominantly within a cortical region where actin filament nucleation occurs and FGFR1 accumulates beyond basal levels following FGF2 stimulation . In FGF2 - stimulated cells depleted of IQGAP1 with siRNA , however , FGFR1 , N - WASP and Arp3 were not recruited to the cortex , and F - actin - rich lamellipodia failed to form . Impaired wound healing by N - WASP - depleted MDBK cells The evidence presented to this point raised the possibility that N - WASP , like IQGAP1 , is required in MDBK cells for FGF2 - stimulated lamellipodial protrusion and cell motility . To test this hypothesis , MDBK cells were depleted of N - WASP with siRNA , and tested for FGF2 - stimulated wound healing . As illustrated in Fig . 5 , wound healing in N - WASP - deficient cultures was severely impaired , and quantitatively similar to the poor wound healing observed in IQGAP1 - depleted cultures . Thus , in contrast to other cellular systems in which WAVE2 was found to support lamellipodial advance ( Yamazaki et al . , 2003 ; Yan et al . , 2003 ) , FGF2 - stimulated lamellipodial protrusion in MDBK cells requires N - WASP . IQGAP1 stimulates branched actin filament nucleation through N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex The requirement for both IQGAP1 and N - WASP for FGF2 - dependent cell migration , and for intracellular association of IQGAP1 , N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex suggested that these three factors work in concert to stimulate actin filament nucleation . This hypothesis was verified using a spectrofluorometric assay for assembly of pyrene - labeled actin ( Bryan and Coluccio , 1985 ) ( Fig . 6A ) . In the presence of 1 . 3 (cid:4) M actin , 50 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and 50 nM N - WASP , the maximum actin assembly rate ( V max ) and shortest lag time to reach V max was achieved at an IQGAP1 concentration of 30 nM . Compared to samples containing 30 nM IQGAP1 , control samples that lacked IQGAP1 assembled with an ~ 50 % slower V max and took four to five times longer to reach V max . Lesser stimulation of actin assembly , or none at all , was observed at lower and higher IQGAP1 concentrations . IQGAP1 thus stimulates actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex and N - WASP , but within a narrow concentration range , suggesting that the effects of IQGAP1 on actin assembly reflect a concentration - dependent balance between stimulatory and inhibitory activities . Similar results were obtained at Arp2 / 3 complex concentrations of 30 - 100 nM , and at N - WASP concentrations of 30 - 350 nM ( as in Fig . 7A ) . IQGAP1 did not stimulate actin assembly appreciably in the absence of other factors , and stimulation required the presence of both the Arp2 / 3 complex and N - WASP ( Fig . 6B ) . Fig . 3 . FGF2 stimulates recruitment of IQGAP1 , N - WASP , Arp2 / 3 complex and FGFR1 to lamellipodia . ( A ) Low - density cultures of serum - starved MDBK cells were stimulated with FGF2 , and lysed at various times thereafter . At each indicated time point , IQGAP1 was immunoprecipitated out of the lysates with monoclonal anti - IQGAP1 , and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to IQGAP1 ( polyclonal ) , N - WASP , Arp3 and FGFR1 . As a control for non - specific immunoprecipitation , the tau - 1 monoclonal antibody to tau , which is not expressed in MDBK cells , was substituted for monoclonal anti - IQGAP1 , 10 minutes after FGF2 stimulation . Note that the IQGAP1 immunoprecipitates contained time - dependent increases in the levels of coimmunoprecipitated N - WASP , Arp3 and FGFR1 , and that none of the proteins assayed by western blotting were immunoprecipitated by anti - tau . ( B ) Glutathione - Sepharose 4B beads were loaded with a fusion protein of the FGFR1 cytoplasmic tail coupled to GST , or to GST alone , and the beads were then mixed with IQGAP1 , N - WASP , or both , and finally immunoblotting was used to detect any IQGAP1 or N - WASP that may have bound to the beads . Immunoblotting demonstrated direct binding of IQGAP1 and indirect , IQGAP1 - dependent association of N - WASP with GST - FGFR1 tail , but not with GST . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 662 Journal of Cell Science 120 ( 4 ) Fig . 4 . IQGAP1 - dependent recruitment of N - WASP , Arp3 and FGFR1 to the cell periphery after FGF2 stimulation . Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed co - recruitment and colocalization of IQGAP1 , N - WASP , Arp3 and FGFR1 to lamellipodia after FGF2 stimulation for 10 minutes , of low - density cultures of serum - starved MDBK cells containing IQGAP1 ( Control cells ) . FGF2 was unable to recruit N - WASP , Arp3 and FGFR1 to cell margins in IQGAP1 - deficient , siRNA - treated cells . To improve visualization of cell margins and intracellular details in IQGAP1 - depleted cells , micrograph exposures for the siRNA samples were twice as long in the TRITC channel and 4 . 5 times longer in the FITC channel as they were for the scrRNA samples . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 663 IQGAP1 links FGF to actin assembly Taken together , these results establish IQGAP1 as a novel activator of N - WASP . Confirmation that IQGAP1 promoted branched actin filament nucleation was obtained by direct visualization of actin polymerization stimulated by IQGAP1 in the presence of the Arp2 / 3 complex and N - WASP , by total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( Kuhn and Pollard , 2005 ) ( Fig . 6C and supplementary material , Movie 1 ) . The rates at which total filament length increased with or without IQGAP1 were similar until ~ 100 seconds , when the rate began to increase more rapidly in the IQGAP1 - containing sample ( Fig . 6D ) . The time point for this transition was also marked by a large increase in the rate at which filament branches appeared in the IQGAP1 - containing sample . Indeed , by plotting the number of branches per (cid:4) m of filament length as a function of time , it became apparent that after 100 seconds of assembly , the density of branches in the presence of IQGAP1 was four - to fivefold higher than in its absence , relatively constant with time for the next 500 seconds , and comparable to what was observed when an optimal concentration of GTP - bound Cdc42 , a robust N - WASP activator ( Rohatgi et al . , 2000 ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) , was used in place of IQGAP1 ( Fig . 6E ) . These results confirm and extend the conclusion from spectrofluorometric assays ( Fig . 6A ) that IQGAP1 stimulates branched actin filament nucleation by activating N - WASP , and by extension , the Arp2 / 3 complex . In addition to binding and activating N - WASP , GTP - activated Cdc42 binds directly to IQGAP1 ( Hart et al . , 1996 ; Kuroda et al . , 1996 ; McCallum et al . , 1996 ) . We therefore compared the ability of activated Cdc42 and IQGAP1 , individually and together , to stimulate actin assembly ( Fig . 7A ) . In the presence of 2 (cid:4) M actin , 50 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and 350 nM N - WASP , optimal concentrations of activated Cdc42 ( 105 nM ) and IQGAP1 ( 35 nM ) promoted actin polymerization nearly identically . When both Cdc42 and IQGAP1 were present , however , the lag time before V max was reached was dramatically reduced and the peak assembly rate increased additively . Similar results were obtained when the concentrations of actin , Arp2 / 3 complex and N - WASP were as low as 1 . 3 (cid:4) M , 30 nM and 50 nM , respectively . IQGAP1 and activated Cdc42 can thus work in concert to drive especially rapid nucleation of actin filament branches . To investigate why stimulation of actin assembly occurs within a narrow range of IQGAP1 concentrations ( Fig . 6A and Fig . 8B ) , we monitored effects of IQGAP1 on assembly stimulated by the Arp2 / 3 complex plus the N - WASP VCA fragment , which constitutively activates the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . As shown in Fig . 7B , IQGAP1 did not bind GST - VCA , but did exhibit dose - dependent inhibition of actin assembly in the presence of GST - VCA plus the Arp2 / 3 complex . By contrast , IQGAP1 (cid:5) NT , which lacks the first 156 N - terminal amino acids of full - length IQGAP1 and does not bind F - actin ( see supplementary material Fig . S1 ) , had no effect on actin assembly stimulated by GST - VCA and the Arp2 / 3 complex . These data suggest that high concentrations of full - length IQGAP1 are less effective at stimulating actin assembly by the Arp2 / 3 complex and N - WASP because of competition between IQGAP1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex for binding to existing actin filaments , where the Arp2 / 3 complex most efficiently nucleates new actin filaments . Stimulation of actin assembly through N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex was also observed for three progressively smaller N - terminal IQGAP1 fragments ( Fig . 8A , B ) : IQGAP1 2 - 522 , a homodimer that binds F - actin ( Mateer et al . , 2002 ) , IQGAP1 2 - 210 , an F - actin binding monomer ( Mateer et al . , 2004 ) , and IQGAP1 2 - 71 , a presumptive monomer that does Fig . 5 . N - WASP is required for FGF2 - stimulated migration of MDBK cells . ( A ) MDBK cells were transfected with N - WASP - specific siRNA or scrambled RNA ( scrRNA ) using a Nucleofector . To allow direct visual comparison of N - WASP levels in the two samples by western blotting , a concentration series of each cell extract was analyzed at the indicated relative dilutions . Note that siRNA reduced the N - WASP level to ~ 1 / 3 of normal , but had no effect on cellular IQGAP1 content . ( B ) Confluent monolayers were then serum - starved for 8 hours , wounded with a micropipette tip , and 2 hours later were stimulated with 25 ng / ml FGF2 . Note that movement of N - WASP - depleted cells into the wound after 9 or 24 hours of FGF2 exposure was severely impaired . ( C ) Percentage of wound closure was quantified by measuring the average width of eight randomly chosen regions of interest of each wound at 0 , 9 , and 24 hours after FGF2 addition . Data are expressed relative to the average wound widths at 0 hours . Error bars indicate standard deviations for three experiments , and asterisks ( * ) , indicate significant differences between scrRNA controls and corresponding siRNA - treated cultures at (cid:3) < 0 . 001 . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 664 not bind F - actin ( Mateer et al . , 2004 ) . By contrast , IQGAP1 (cid:5) NT showed little evidence of assembly stimulation . Like full - length IQGAP1 , each N - terminal fragment had an optimal concentration for stimulating the rate of actin assembly . The V max for each fragment at its optimal concentration was similar to that observed for full - length IQGAP1 , although the lag time before V max was reached was much longer for the stimulatory fragments than for full - length IQGAP1 ( Fig . 8B ) . We , therefore , conclude that several N - terminal fragments of IQGAP1 can stimulate actin assembly in the presence of the Journal of Cell Science 120 ( 4 ) Arp2 / 3 complex and N - WASP , albeit not as well as full - length IQGAP1 . Furthermore , this stimulatory activity of IQGAP1 does not require dimerization or binding to actin filaments . Actin assembly stimulation in the presence of the Arp2 / 3 complex and N - WASP is well correlated with direct binding of IQGAP1 or IQGAP1 fragments to N - WASP . Purified , N - terminally his - tagged versions of full - length IQGAP1 , IQGAP1 2 - 522 , IQGAP1 2 - 210 , IQGAP1 2 - 71 , and IQGAP1 (cid:5) NT were bound to nickel - agarose beads and mixed with purified N - WASP . Fig . 8C demonstrates that N - WASP bound Fig . 6 . Stimulation of branched actin filament assembly by IQGAP1 . ( A ) Effects of IQGAP1 on actin ( 5 % labeled with pyrene ) assembly in the presence of N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex were monitored using a pyrene - actin fluorescence assay . Note that maximal stimulation of assembly was achieved at 30 nM IQGAP1 , and that higher and lower concentrations stimulated less or not at all . ( B ) Actin assembly stimulation by IQGAP1 requires N - WASP plus Arp2 / 3 complex . ( C ) IQGAP1 - stimulated assembly of branched actin filament networks observed directly by TIRF microscopy . ( D ) Total lengths of actin filaments observed by TIRF microscopy were measured as a function of time , for samples containing or lacking IQGAP1 or activated Cdc42 , a previously described for the N - WASP activator ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . Maximum rates of actin assembly were achieved in the IQGAP1 sample . ( E ) The same micrographs were used to determine the number of filament branch points per (cid:4) m of actin filament as a function of time . Note that the IQGAP1 and Cdc42 samples quickly attained a filament branch density four - to fivefold greater than the control sample that contained neither IQGAP1 nor Cdc42 . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 665 IQGAP1 links FGF to actin assembly specifically to all IQGAP1 proteins tested . These results establish the presence of an N - WASP binding region near the N terminus of IQGAP1 , and imply that binding underlies N - WASP activation . The ability of IQGAP1 (cid:5) NT to bind N - WASP , but its borderline ability to stimulate actin assembly indicates , however , that binding and activation of N - WASP are separable . Using similar nickel - agarose pull - down assays , we did not detect direct binding of IQGAP2 to the Arp2 / 3 complex ( not shown ) . Discussion The collective data presented here suggest that activation of a cell surface receptor , FGFR1 , by one of its extracellular ligands , FGF2 , recruits IQGAP1 to the cortically localized cytoplasmic domain of the receptor . IQGAP1 then promotes branched actin filament nucleation through N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex , and as a result , lamellipodial protrusion , in the immediate vicinity of activated receptors . This mechanism by which IQGAP1 serves as an intermediate between growth factor signaling , and cellular morphogenesis and motility likely applies to IQGAP1 - dependent migration of endothelial cells stimulated by VEGF binding to VEGFR2 ( Yamaoka - Tojo et al . , 2004 ) , and may apply to other growth factor - receptor pairs that await identification . A different member of the IQGAP family , IQGAP2 , which is 62 % identical in amino acid sequence to IQGAP1 ( Brill et al . , 1996 ) , may use a related mechanism to trigger actin assembly and cellular morphogenesis in platelets . The filopodia and lamellipodia that platelets elaborate after thrombin activation may owe their formation to thrombin - induced macromolecular assemblies of IQGAP1 , actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Schmidt et al . , 2003 ) . A key question that remains unanswered is why suppression of IQGAP1 protein levels so dramatically reduces cell motility ( Fig . 1 and Fig . 5C ) ( see also Mataraza et al . , 2003 ; Watanabe et al . , 2004 ; Yamaoka - Tojo et al . , 2004 ) when several N - WASP - independent pathways for activating Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated cell motility are known to exist ( Miki and Takenawa , 2003 ) , and WAVE2 ( Suetsugu et al . , 2003 ; Yamazaki et al . , 2003 ) , rather than N - WASP ( Benesch et al . , 2005 ) , is thought to be the principal Arp2 / 3 complex activator for lamellipodial advance . Among many possible explanations worth exploring are that specific receptor - ligand pairs , such as FGFR1 - FGF2 and VEGFR2 - VEGF , trigger Arp2 / 3 complex activation primarily through IQGAP1 and N - WASP , that N - WASP is not the only Arp2 / 3 complex activator that can be stimulated by IQGAP1 , and that actin assembly stimulated by IQGAP1 indirectly supports lamellipodial protrusion . Regarding the last possibility , IQGAP1 knockdown may impair cell motility Fig . 7 . Co - stimulation of actin assembly by IQGAP1 plus activated Cdc42 , and inhibition of VCA - stimulated actin assembly by IQGAP1 . ( A ) When used together , IQGAP1 and activated Cdc42 stimulated actin assembly rates additively , and virtually eliminated the lag period before peak assembly rates were reached using either IQGAP1 or activated Cdc42 alone . ( B ) In the presence of a GST - tagged , constitutively active , N - WASP VCA fragment , IQGAP1 , but not IQGAP1 (cid:5) NT , caused dose - dependent inhibition of assembly . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 666 because it reduces the levels of activated Cdc42 and Rac1 ( Mataraza et al . , 2003 ) , which are known to stimulate the Arp2 / 3 complex indirectly through activation of WASP / WAVE proteins ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Alternatively , receptor trafficking , which could be required for sustained cell migration in response to extracellular growth factors , may depend on actin assembly stimulated by IQGAP1 . In favor of the receptor trafficking model is evidence that N - WASP , along with the Arp2 / 3 complex , is recruited to clathrin - coated pits as they invaginate , and is required for receptor - mediated endocytosis of EGF receptors ( Benesch et al . , 2005 ) . Considering the ability of IQGAP1 to bind N - WASP directly ( Fig . 8C ) and to stimulate actin assembly through N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 6 ) , it is possible that IQGAP1 is necessary for normal FGFR1 trafficking , at least at the step of receptor endocytosis , which in turn might be required for Journal of Cell Science 120 ( 4 ) formation of productive protrusions in cells stimulated by FGF2 . An equally attractive possibility concerns the mechanical strength of branched actin filament networks . IQGAP1 is a homodimeric protein that can crosslink actin filaments ( Bashour et al . , 1997 ) because it contains an F - actin binding calponin homology domain on each of its two identical subunits ( Mateer et al . , 2004 ) . By joining N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex in a supramolecular complex that nucleates actin filament branches , IQGAP1 may reside at the junction of mother and daughter filaments in branched filament networks , where it would be ideally positioned to crosslink mother and daughter filaments , and thus might provide branched filament networks with increased mechanical integrity . Fortifying filament networks in such a manner could allow filaments that are at the leading edge and anchored to the lamellipodial Fig . 8 . IQGAP1 fragments stimulate actin assembly and bind N - WASP . ( A ) A schematic representation of functional domains present in recombinant full - length IQGAP1 and four fragments used for experiments documented here : CHD , F - actin - binding calponin homology domain ; IR , IQGAP repeats that mediate homodimerization ; WW , ERK2 - binding WW domain ; IQ , calmodulin - binding IQ motifs ; GRD , GAP ( GTPase activating protein ) - related domain involved in binding activated Cdc42 and Rac1 . All proteins were his - tagged at their N termini , and the diagrams indicate whether each protein is a monomer or homodimer in aqueous solution . ( B ) The pyrene actin assembly assay was used to evaluate each protein at several concentrations in the presence of 1 . 3 (cid:4) M actin ( 5 % pyrene - labeled ) , 50 nM N - WASP and 50 nM Arp2 / 3 complex . Shown here are the maximum velocities ( V max ) of actin assembly ( upper panels ) and lag times before V max was reached ( lower panels ) . Note that optimal concentrations of all recombinant proteins , except IQGAP1 (cid:5) NT , supported a V max approx . twofold higher than controls that contained only actin , N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 complex , but that the optimal concentration of full - length IQGAP1 ( IQGAP1 FL ) reached V max at least twice as fast as the fragments . ( C ) N - WASP was mixed with nickel - agarose beads or nickel - agarose beads that were pre - loaded with recombinant , his - tagged IQGAP1 FL , IQGAP1 (cid:5) NT , IQGAP1 2 - 522 , IQGAP1 2 - 210 , IQGAP1 2 - 71 , or tau as a negative control . Beads contained an approx . twofold molar excess of his - tagged proteins relative to N - WASP , and chemiluminescent immunoblotting was used to detect any N - WASP that may have bound to beads . Note the specific binding of N - WASP to all forms of IQGAP1 that were tested . The slightly increased electrophoretic mobility of N - WASP in the IQGAP1 2 - 522 pull - down assay probably represents a gel artefact caused by that fact N - WASP and IQGAP1 2 - 522 migrate nearly identically in SDS - PAGE . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 667 IQGAP1 links FGF to actin assembly network to push forward the plasma membrane more effectively as filament polymerization proceeds . We are not aware of any protein other than IQGAP1 that both stimulates branched actin filament nucleation through the Arp2 / 3 complex and crosslinks actin filaments . Thus , even if IQGAP1 was a relatively minor stimulator of the Arp2 / 3 complex in most cellular contexts , its actin filament crosslinking activity could be crucial for formation of productive lamellipodia . Although direct binding of activated Cdc42 to N - WASP allows N - WASP to stimulate the actin filament nucleating activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro in the absence of additional factors ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) , other proteins could play very important roles in this process . For example , WASP - interacting protein ( WIP ) - mediated inhibition of N - WASP can be relieved by activated Cdc42 , but in a manner dependent on forming binding protein 1 - like ( FNBP1L , also known as Toca - 1 ) , which binds both activated Cdc42 and N - WASP ( Ho et al . , 2004 ) . By comparison , and as shown here , IQGAP1 can bind and stimulate N - WASP independently of activated Cdc42 ( Fig . 6 , Fig . 7A and Fig . 8C ) , but can also act cooperatively with activated Cdc42 to promote actin filament nucleation in vitro through N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 7A ) . In the latter case , IQGAP1 , like Toca - 1 , may engage activated Cdc42 and N - WASP as a complex that sustains a high level of filament formation at the leading edge of motile cells . The increased number of lamellipodial protrusions and their faster rate of forward extension after stimulation of MDBK cells with FGF2 are consistent with this idea . The fact that IQGAP1 depletion leads to reduced levels of activated Cdc42 and Rac1 in cells ( Mataraza et al . , 2003 ) provides additional support for this notion . Cdc42 binds IQGAP1 with 50 - fold higher affinity than it binds WASP , a protein closely related to N - WASP ( Zhang et al . , 1997 ) , so IQGAP1 could serve to anchor activated Cdc42 in close association with N - WASP . Finally , IQGAP1 and WASP interact with physically distinct regions of activated Cdc42 ( Li et al . , 1999 ) , so maximal activation of N - WASP might be achieved by simultaneous interactions of activated Cdc42 with both IQGAP1 and N - WASP . Thus , a Cdc42 - IQGAP1 complex , rather than Cdc42 and IQGAP1 acting independently , may be responsible for maintaining N - WASP - dependent and Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent protrusive activity . On the other hand , binding of activated Cdc42 to IQGAP1 would also be expected to increase cell - cell adhesion by dissociating IQGAP1 from E - cadherin and (cid:2) - catenin , and thereby strengthen the cadherin - catenin - actin connection that acts as a counterforce to cell migration ( Kuroda et al . , 1998 ) . The apparent migration - promoting and cell - cell adhesion promoting activities of IQGAP1 are not necessarily in conflict , but it seems unlikely that decreased intercellular adhesion underlies IQGAP1 - dependent cell motility induced by FGF2 . On the contrary , assuming that one effect of FGF2 stimulation was an increase in IQGAP1 - dependent intercellular adhesion , that effect must be overwhelmed by IQGAP1 - dependent actin assembly and consequent lamellipodial protrusion induced by FGF2 . The failure of FGFR1 , N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex to be recruited to the cell cortex following FGF2 stimulation of IQGAP1 - deficient cells ( Fig . 4 ) indicates that IQGAP1 plays a far broader role in cell motility than merely stimulating actin filament nucleation . IQGAP1 also appears to recruit to the cell surface many key components of the motile machinery . This finding is reminiscent of recent reports that IQGAP1 integrates the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons by binding directly to both CLIP - 170 and APC , which are microtubule plus end tracking proteins ( Fukata et al . , 2002 ; Watanabe et al . , 2004 ) . IQGAP1 may thus be a master organizer of signal transduction , cytoskeletal and cell adhesion molecules that act cooperatively to regulate cell motility and morphogenesis . We suggest in particular that the interaction of IQGAP1 with FGFR1 represents a critical step that bridges extracellular signals with cellular responses . IQGAP1 may establish or maintain FGF2 - dependent signaling by regulating the polarized distribution of FGFR1 receptors at the cell surface . Through its F - actin binding activity , IQGAP1 may stabilize connections among cell surface FGFR1 , cortical F - actin and the machinery that powers cell movement . In this regard , IQGAP1 and N - WASP may function to maintain FGFR1 homeostasis at the plasma membrane . Materials and Methods Antibodies The following antibodies were used : primary mouse monoclonal anti - IQGAP1 ( Mateer et al . , 2002 ) , anti - actin ( Chemicon ) and tau - 1 ( Binder et al . , 1985 ) , and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to IQGAP1 ( Mateer et al . , 2002 ) , N - WASP ( Santa Cruz ) , Arp3 ( Welch et al . , 1997 ) and FGFR1 ( Santa Cruz ) . Secondary antibodies included goat anti - mouse IgG and goat anti - rabbit IgG labeled with FITC or TRITC ( Southern Biotech , Birmingham , AL ) , goat anti - mouse IgG labeled with Alexa Fluor - 647 ( Molecular Probes ) , and goat anti - mouse IgG and goat - anti rabbit IgG labeled with horseradish peroxidase ( KPL Inc . , Gaithersburg , MD ) . Cell culture , IQGAP1 and N - WASP knockdown , and wound healing MDBK ( Madin - Darby bovine kidney ) epithelial cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco’s miminum essential medium ( Gibco ) plus 10 % Cosmic calf serum ( HyClone ) . siRNA for bovine IQGAP1 ( target sequence : AAGGCTGAGCTGGTGAAACTG ) and a scrambled ( scrRNA ) control ( target sequence : AAGTACCAGGGACGTGAGTGT ) were purchased from Qiagen as Alexa Fluor - 647 - labeled products . siRNA for N - WASP was purchased from Dharmacon ( catalogue no . D - 006444 - 06 ) , and according to the manufacturer was directed against a human N - WASP sequence that is identical to the corresponding bovine N - WASP sequence . 2 (cid:4) g of siRNA specific for IQGAP1 or N - WASP , or 2 (cid:4) g of scrRNA were transfected into MDBK cells using a Nucleofector ( Amaxa , Cologne , Germany ) and the protocol specifically recommended by the manufacturer for MDBK cells ( Nucleofector Kit R and program X - 001 ) . 48 - 72 hours after transfection , confluent monolayers of cells that were growing in 24 - well dishes and had been serum starved for the previous 8 hours were wounded by scratching with a micropipette tip . The cells were allowed to recover for 2 hours , after which media were replaced with fresh media containing or lacking 25 ng / ml FGF2 ( Sigma ) . Phase contrast micrographs of the cultures were taken within 30 minutes after wounding and at various times thereafter using Scion Image software ( Scion , Frederick , MD ) and a Cohu model 2222 - 1000 camera mounted on a Nikon Diaphot microscope with a Nikon 10 (cid:6) , 0 . 25 NA , phase 1 DL objective . Kymographic analysis MDBK cell cultures were transfected by nucleofection with scrRNA or siRNA and grown to confluence , after which 5 (cid:6) 10 4 cells were subcultured onto 25 mm round , # 1 thickness coverslips coated with 5 (cid:4) g / ml fibronectin ( Sigma ) , and grown overnight in serum - containing medium . The cells were then cultured for at least 14 hours in serum - free medium , and finally for 4 hours in Phenol - Red - free MEM containing 15 mM Hepes ( Gibco ) . Following this MEM acclimation period , cells were imaged by time - lapse phase contrast microscopy at 12 frames per minute beginning 5 minutes before addition of 50 ng / ml FGF2 , which occurred 48 - 72 hours after transfection . Images were captured without binning using a Hamamatsu Orca - ER 1 . 3 megapixel cooled CCD mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert S100 equipped with a Zeiss 63 (cid:6) 1 . 4 NA phase 3 planapochromatic objective . Cells were maintained on the microscope stage in Attofluor Cell Chambers ( BD Bioscience , Rockville , MD ) at 37°C in an atmosphere of 95 % air plus 5 % CO 2 . OpenLab 4 software ( Improvision ) running on a Power Macintosh G4 computer ( Apple ) was used to control the camera and shutters , and to program the time - lapse parameters . NIH Image 1 . 62 public domain software ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / nih - image / ) was used to generate kymographs of lamellipodia ( Hinz et al . , 1999 ) from user - specified regions of interest . Excel 2004 for Mac ( Microsoft ) was used to generate the bar graphs of protrusion frequency , velocity and persistence shown in Fig . 2B , and SPSS 11 for J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 668 Journal of Cell Science 120 ( 4 ) Mac OS X statistical software ( SPSS , Inc . ) was used for one - way ANOVA ( see supplementary material Table S1 ) . Fluorescence microscopy Cells were fixed and permeabilized either by immersion for 5 minutes in methanol at – 20°C , or by successive incubations in 4 % (cid:7) - formaldehyde in PBS ( 10 minutes ) followed by 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ( 2 minutes ) . After fixation and permeabilization , cells were washed thoroughly and incubated successively with primary and secondary antibodies for 1 hour each , with several washes after each antibody step . F - actin was detected in (cid:7) - formaldehyde - fixed , Triton X - 100 - permeabilized cells with Alexa Fluor 568 - phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) . Fluorescence confocal micrographs were taken using a CARV spinning disk confocal head ( Atto Instruments ) mounted on the Zeiss microscope system described earlier . Immunoprecipitation Sub - confluent MDBK cells were serum starved for 12 - 18 hours , before being stimulated with 50 ng / ml FGF2 . Cells harvested just prior to FGF2 addition and at various times thereafter were lysed in buffer A ( 50 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 2 mM NaVO 4 , 20 mM NaF , 1 mM PMSF , and 2 (cid:4) g / ml each of chymostatin , leupeptin and pepstatin A ) , and the lysates were then clarified by centrifugation . Monoclonal anti - IQGAP1 , or monoclonal tau - 1 as an irrelevant control , was then added to the clarified lysates , which were subsequently incubated for 4 hours at 4°C . Next , EZview red protein - G affinity gel beads ( Sigma ) were added to samples , which were incubated for an additional 2 hours at 4°C . Immuno - complexes were collected by brief centrifugation , washed in buffer B ( 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM PMSF ) , and analyzed by immunoblotting using polyclonal antibodies to IQGAP1 , N - WASP , Arp3 and FGFR1 , and SuperSignal chemiluminescent reagents ( Pierce ) . Affinity pull - down assay Coding DNA for the FGFR1 cytoplasmic domain was amplified by PCR from mouse brain cDNA using the following primers : forward , 5 (cid:8) - gtcatc - atctataagatgaagagcggc - 3 (cid:8) ; reverse , 5 (cid:8) - ctcaggtaacggctcatgagagaagac - 3 (cid:8) . Eco RI and Not I cloning sites were added by PCR using these primers : forward , 5 (cid:8) - gcgggaattcgtcatcatctaaga - 3 (cid:8) ; reverse , 5 (cid:8) - gaagcggccgcctcaggtaacgg - 3 (cid:8) . GST - FGFR1 tail and unmodified GST were expressed in transformed E . coli ( strain BL21 ) , and purified from bacterial lysates using glutathione - Sepharose 4B beads ( Pharmacia ) . Glutathione - Sepaharose 4B beads containing ~ 2 (cid:4) M GST - FGFR1 tail or GST were then mixed with 1 (cid:4) M IQGAP1 FL ; Ni - NTA - agarose ( nickel ) affinity beads ( Qiagen ) containing ~ 1 (cid:4) M his - tagged IQGAP1 FL , IQGAP1 (cid:5) NT , IQGAP1 2 - 522 , IQGAP1 2 - 210 , IQGAP1 2 - 71 , or tau were mixed with 500 nM N - WASP . After a 1 - hour incubation , beads were collected by centrifugation and washed , and bound proteins were analyzed by chemiluminescent immunoblotting . Pyrene - actin assembly assay Previously published methods were used to purify rabbit muscle actin ( Bashour et al . , 1997 ) , and recombinant , his - tagged IQGAP1 FL , IQGAP1 (cid:5) NT , IQGAP1 2 - 522 , IQGAP1 2 - 210 and IQGAP1 2 - 71 ( Mateer et al . , 2004 ) . IQGAP1 (cid:5) NT is a newly described deletion mutant derived from a pBlueScript II SK ( + ) plasmid containing the full - length human cDNA for IQGAP1 ( pBSIQG1 - MH ) by the same methods used to create the other IQGAP1 deletion mutants used in this study . IQGAP1 (cid:5) NT lacks only the first 156 amino acids of full - length IQGAP1 , and was purified from baculovirus - infected Sf9 insect cells . Published methods were also used for purifying GST - VCA from bacteria ( Egile et al . , 1999 ) , the Arp2 / 3 complex from bovine calf thymus ( Higgs et al . , 1999 ) and rat N - WASP from baculovirus - infected Sf9 cells ( Miki et al . , 1998 ) , and for covalently coupling pyrene to purified actin ( Bryan and Coluccio , 1985 ) . Pyrene - actin assembly assays were performed in polymerization buffer ( 2 mM Tris , and 20 mM imidazole pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP and 0 . 2 mM PMSF ) using 365 nm excitation and 386 nm emission in a Photon Technology Incorporated model QM - 4 / 5000 spetrofluorometer . In each assay , 5 % of the total actin was pyrene - labeled . Prior to performing actin assembly assays by spectrofluorometry or TIRF microscopy , proteins were dialyzed overnight at 4°C in the following buffers : actin ( 2 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 ) ; the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM KCl , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) ; all forms of IQGAP1 ( 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 20 mM imidazole , 200 mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM PMSF ) ; N - WASP ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 mM PMSF ) . Following dialysis , insoluble protein was removed from each sample by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 4°C at 213 , 483 g ( max . ) in a Beckman TLA 120 . 1 rotor using a Beckman Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge . Next , the actin was mixed with EGTA to 1 mM and MgCl 2 to 0 . 1 mM , and then incubated for 2 minutes at room temperature . During this 2 minute period , the remaining proteins were mixed together , and the cocktail was adjusted with concentrated stock solutions of buffers , salts , ATP and PMSF to yield a final solution composition at pH 7 . 5 of 20 mM Tris , 20 mM imidazole , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP and 0 . 2 mM PMSF . TIRF microscopy Methods for preparing Oregon Green - labeled actin , and TIRF microscopy have been described previously ( Kuhn and Pollard , 2005 ) . Images were captured at 5 - second intervals on an Olympus IX 71 inverted microscope using a 60 (cid:6) / 1 . 45 NA Olympus objective , a Melles Griot 25 mW argon laser , a Roper CoolSNAP cooled CCD , and Scanalytics IP Lab software . Samples were prepared exactly as for pyrene - actin assembly assays , except that Oregon green - actin was used at 20 % of total actin in place of 5 % pyrene - actin . Sample chambers were coated with 6 . 25 - 25 nM N - ethylmaleimide - modified ( Veigel et al . , 1998 ) rabbit skeletal muscle myosin II ( Sigma ) prior to loading actin assembly cocktails into the chambers . TIRF experiments were typically terminated after 10 minutes , when substrate - bound actin filaments became so dense that it was no longer possible to resolve individual filaments .
