Three clathrin light chains ( CLC ) , along with three clathrin 12 heavy chains , assemble to form single clathrin triskelia that link into a geometric lattice 13 that curves to drive endocytosis . Conformational changes in CLC have been shown to 14 regulate triskelia assembly in solution , yet the nature of these structural changes , and 15 their effects on lattice growth , curvature , and endocytosis in cells are unclear . Here , we 16 develop a correlative fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) and platinum replica 17 electron microscopy method , named FRET - CLEM . With FRET - CLEM , we measure 18 conformational changes in proteins at thousands of individual morphologically distinct 19 clathrin - coated structures across cell membranes . We find that the N - terminus of CLC 20 moves away from the plasma membrane and triskelia vertex as lattices curve . Preventing 21 this conformational switch with acute chemical tools inside cells increased clathrin 22 structure sizes and inhibited endocytosis . Therefore , a specific conformational switch in 23 CLC regulates lattice curvature and endocytosis in mammalian cells . 24 25 2 Introduction 26 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is the primary internalization pathway in eukaryotic cells , 27 and is key to many processes , including nutrient uptake , excitability , signaling , and the 28 recycling of membrane components 1 . Over 50 proteins have been implicated in this 29 process 2 , 3 . Determining the nanoscale localizations 4 , 5 , numbers 6 , 7 , accumulation 30 dynamics 8 , 9 , interactions 1 , and conformations 10 , 11 of these proteins in cells is important for 31 understanding how the endocytic machinery operates in health and disease . 32 33 Assembly and curvature of clathrin lattices are required steps to build cargo - loaded 34 vesicles 12 - 14 . The basic unit of the clathrin lattice is the clathrin triskelion 15 , 16 . This six 35 protein complex is composed of three clathrin heavy chains and three smaller clathrin 36 light chains ( CLCs ) that form a three - legged pinwheel ( Fig S1A ) 17 . The heavy chains 37 provide the backbone , and light chains are thought to regulate the assembly of the lattice 38 and effect its mechanical properties 16 . Work both in vitro and in cells has indicated its 39 important role 18 - 22 , yet the structural , and functional actions of the light chains are not 40 fully understood 16 , 23 . 41 42 In vitro , clathrin triskelia assemble into spherical cages 13 . Clathrin light chain inhibits 43 this assembly 24 , 25 . Light chain binds to heavy chain through multiple interactions 16 . One 44 specific interaction occurs through an acidic patch ( EED ) near the light chain’s N - terminus 45 and the heavy chain’s knee ( Fig S1A ) 26 . This interaction prevents cage assembly by 46 regulating the heavy chain knee conformation ( Fig S1B ) 17 . If CLC binds to the heavy chain 47 through these N - terminal contacts , CLC adopts an extended conformation , stabilizing a 48 straight conformation of the heavy chain knee . The straight conformation cannot assume 49 the angles needed for cage assembly . However , if this interaction is prevented , the heavy 50 chain knee is free to move , allowing the knee to bend and assemble as a cage . Thus , 51 conformational switching of CLC is proposed to control the assembly of lattices 17 . Yet , the 52 nature of these structural changes , and their effects on lattice growth , and curvature at 53 the membrane of living cells are mostly unknown . 54 3 55 Recent super - resolution imaging studies have mapped changes in protein locations at 56 distinct stages of endocytosis at the scale of tens of nanometers 4 , 5 . Proteins are , however , 57 regulated by sub - ten nanometer intra - and intermolecular conformational changes and 58 binding events . To understand endocytosis , these conformational changes need to be 59 determined 3 , 13 . This is a major gap in understanding endocytosis . Yet , the precision of 60 super - resolution imaging cannot measure structural changes at these scales . Fluorescence 61 ( or Förster ) resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) , however , can fill this gap , mapping 62 molecular interactions and conformational changes within and between proteins 27 . 63 Specifically , FRET occurs when a donor fluorophore and acceptor are generally separated 64 by less than 10 nm 28 . While FRET measurements are usually made with diffraction 65 limited imaging , super - resolved FRET methods have been reported 29 . The resolution , 66 labeling density , and colors possible in these experiments , however , are not able to 67 discriminate morphological differences in small organelles such as clathrin - coated 68 structures ( CCSs ) . For example , past FRET analysis of the protein organization of CCSs in 69 yeast was limited to a late stage of endocytosis trapped by drug treatments 30 . Thus , 70 existing methods cannot readily relate changes in protein conformation generated from 71 FRET to the morphological stages of clathrin - coated pits as they grow and curve . 72 73 To overcome this gap , we turned to correlative light and electron microscopy ( CLEM ) 31 . 74 CLEM can directly map fluorescence signals to single nanoscale cellular structures 75 visualized in paired electron microscopy ( EM ) images 32 . Platinum replica transmission EM 76 ( PREM ) of unroofed cell plasma membranes provides a uniquely high contrast , high - 77 resolution , and wide - field view of the inner plasma membrane of cells 33 . PREM has been 78 combined with diffraction limited 34 , 35 , super - resolution 4 , 36 - 39 , and polarized total internal 79 reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) 40 microscopy to investigate molecular mechanisms of 80 endocytosis , exocytosis , and the cortical cytoskeleton . Here , we develop a correlative 81 lifetime based - FRET ( FLIM - FRET ) and PREM method , named FRET - CLEM . This method 82 allows us to measure changes in protein interactions and conformations at distances less 83 4 than 10 nm at single structurally - defined organelles in single cells . We investigate the 84 conformational changes in clathrin light chain by mapping distance changes both parallel 85 and perpendicular to the plasma membrane . We find that the N - terminus of CLC moves 86 away from both the CLC C - terminus and the plane of the plasma membrane as clathrin 87 sites gain curvature . To determine the mechanistic impact of these structural changes , we 88 develop a method to directly manipulate the N - terminal position of clathrin light chain 89 using a chemically - inducible dimerization system . These manipulations were confirmed 90 with FRET . With acute chemical perturbation , we show that inhibiting conformational 91 changes in CLC’s N - terminus increases clathrin lattice size , impairs maturation of clathrin 92 structures at the plasma membrane , and inhibits transferrin endocytosis . Together , these 93 data reveal a new conformational switch in clathrin light chain that regulates endocytosis 94 in living cells . 95 96 Results 97 98 Correlative FLIM - FRET and PREM method ( FRET - CLEM ) 99 To determine sub - ten nanometer conformational movements during endocytosis , we 100 established a new correlative FLIM - FRET and PREM method , which we named FRET - 101 CLEM ( Fig 1 ) . We chose monomeric EGFP and a dark yellow fluorescent protein , 102 ShadowY 41 , as an optimized FRET pair by comparing six potential fluorescent protein ( FP ) 103 pairs ( Fig S2A ) . Calculations from the emission and absorbance spectra of this pair 104 resulted in an estimated R 0 value ( distance of 50 % FRET efficiency ) of 60 Å ( Fig S2B ) . In 105 line with these calculations , tandem EGFP - ShadowY probes fused to CLC showed > 50 % 106 FRET efficiency on the plasma membrane ( Fig S3 , A - D ) . We used this construct as a 107 positive FRET control . Next , to test whether FRET could be localized to single CCS , we 108 performed FRET - CLEM measurements on HeLa cells expressing EGFP - CLC or EGFP - 109 ShadowY - CLC ( Fig 1A ) . First , cells were unroofed to expose the inner surface of the 110 plasma membrane and rapidly fixed 33 . These membranes provide uniquely high contrast , 111 low background , ultra - thin samples for fluorescence imaging 31 . Unroofed cells were then 112 5 imaged with FLIM and subsequently prepared for platinum replica electron microscopy 113 ( PREM ) . Past work has shown that these sample preparation steps do not measurably 114 change the morphology and structure of the membrane and its associated endocytic 115 organelles 4 , 36 , 42 . This correlative method allows us to assign single diffraction - limited 116 fluorescent spots from a FLIM image to a single clathrin structure visualized in PREM 117 ( Fig 1A ) . Because PREM has a high spatial resolution , single fluorescent spots in the 118 FLIM image can be further classified according to the nanoscale structural features of the 119 clathrin lattice ( Fig 1B ) 42 . We then tested whether fluorescence lifetimes can be analyzed 120 at single CCS resolution . With the total photon number detected by our FLIM acquisition 121 parameters ( Fig S3 , E - G , and Materials and Methods ) , fluorescence lifetime decay curves 122 determined from single CCSs were clearly separated between negative EGFP - CLC and 123 positive EGFP - ShadowY - CLC FRET controls ( Fig 1C ) . Specifically , they could be fit with a 124 bi - exponential where the FRET efficiency was determined for each CCS ( Fig S3H ) 43 . 125 However , curve - fitting was suboptimal for small CCSs due to the limited number of 126 photons 44 . Thus , to measure as many clathrin structures as possible across a cell , the 127 mean fluorescence lifetime was used to estimate FRET efficiencies across all structures 128 ( Fig 1D ) . These results show that FRET - CLEM can be used to generate FRET - based 129 atomic - scale distances at single CCS resolution at morphologically distinct stages of 130 endocytosis at the plasma membrane of mammalian cells . 131 132 Conformational changes in CLC in cells 133 Next , we applied FRET - CLEM to study conformational changes in CLC at the plasma 134 membrane . In vitro , clathrin triskelia assemble into empty cages and CLC regulates this 135 assembly 26 . CLC has been proposed to take two different conformations when bound to 136 triskelia , an extended and bent conformation ( Fig 2A ) 17 . Here , we assumed three models of 137 CLC conformations in cells based on in vitro models ( Fig 2A ) . First , we assume the 138 spherical triskelia in cells resembles in vitro assembled cages and contains bent CLC . 139 Next , we propose three possible models for light chain dynamics during curvature . In the 140 first , CLC does not change conformations after assembly on the plasma membrane . Here , 141 6 CLC assumes the bent conformation regardless of the curvature stage of the lattice ( flat , 142 domed , spherical ) . In the second , the proportions of extended and bent CLC gradually 143 shifts as curvature increases during endocytosis . In the third , as yet undescribed 144 conformations of CLC are present in flat and domed clathrin , that switches to the bent 145 conformation in spheres . 146 147 To test these models , we used FRET - CLEM . Specifically , the distances between the N - 148 terminus and C - terminus of surrounding CLCs differ substantially between the extended 149 and bent conformations according to structural models 17 , 45 ( Fig 2 , B and C , and Fig S1 , C 150 and D ) . Thus , if the population of extended and bent conformations change on the plasma 151 membrane during lattice assembly , FRET between the N - and C - terminus of CLCs should 152 likewise change ( model 2 in Fig 2A ) . Alternatively , if the conformations do not change , 153 FRET should remain the same across all clathrin subtypes ( model 1 in Fig 2A ) . 154 155 To compare models 1 and 2 , we performed FRET - CLEM measurements on HeLa cells 156 expressing EGFP - CLC , or EGFP - CLC and CLC - ShadowY ( Fig 2D and Fig S4 , A and B ) . 157 Mean fluorescence lifetimes from single CCSs were analyzed by grouping them according 158 to lattice curvature determined from PREM images ( flat , domed , and sphere ; Fig 1B ) . In 159 cells expressing both EGFP - CLC and CLC - ShadowY , fluorescence lifetimes increased as 160 clathrin lattices curved ( Fig 2D ) . This substantial increase did not occur when expressing 161 only EGFP - CLC . The neuronal isoform of CLC which has an insertion of residues near the 162 C - terminus 16 and was used in the previous in vitro study 17 showed similar lifetime 163 changes ( Fig S5 ) . In living cells , FRET efficiencies between EGFP - CLC and CLC - ShadowY 164 were higher on CCSs than in the cytosol ( Fig S6 ) . However , unlike previous measurements 165 in solution 17 , our FRET measurements reflected both intra - and inter - triskelia FRET . 166 Next , we measured EGFP - CLC ∆ N ( Fig 2E and Fig S4 , C and D ) which is a truncation 167 mutant of the flexible N - terminal domain ( residues 1 - 89 ) . In this mutant , EGFP would be 168 bound near the heavy chain binding helix 15 . For this truncation , fluorescence lifetimes did 169 not substantially change across different lattice states . These data indicate that the N - 170 7 terminal position of CLC undergoes a conformational switch at clathrin lattices on the 171 plasma membrane during endocytosis . These data are not consistent with model 1 . 172 Further , fluorescence lifetimes from cells expressing EGFP - CLC and ShadowY - CLC 173 changed across different stages ( Fig S4 , G and H ) . This supports the movement of CLC N - 174 terminal region . Next , to further test model 2 , we tested the QQN mutants of clathrin light 175 chain ( residues 20 – 22 were substituted from EED to QQN ) ( Fig 2F and Fig S4 , E and F ) . 176 QQN mutants are deficient in binding to clathrin heavy chain near the triskelion vertex 177 due to a loss of a negatively - charged patch at the N - terminus ( Fig S1A ) 26 . Thus , they are 178 inhibited from adopting the proposed extended conformation 17 . Here , if model 2 is correct , 179 FRET across the structural states should differ between wild type and QQN mutants . 180 Specifically , QQN mutants are expected to show a smaller displacement in conformations 181 and smaller changes in fluorescence lifetime as the lattice curves . However , in these 182 mutants , we found similar fluorescence lifetime changes as in the wild type protein ( Fig 2 183 D and f ) . These data do not support model 2 . Thus , we conclude that CLC structural 184 movements at the plasma membrane cannot be described by current in vitro models 185 ( model 1 or 2 ) . 186 187 CLC N - terminal region moves away from the plasma membrane 188 Next , we measured FRET between EGFP positioned in different domains of clathrin light 189 chain and the membrane resident dark quencher dipicrylamine ( DPA ) ( Fig S2C ) 46 . Because 190 the plane of the membrane is fixed , FRET between EGFP and DPA provides relative 191 distances perpendicular to the plane of the plasma membrane 47 , 48 . Specifically , when 192 EGFP sits near the membrane , FRET efficiency is high and fluorescence lifetimes are 193 short ( Fig 3A ) . With DPA , CLC - EGFP showed the shortest lifetime ( Fig 3 , B and C ) . This 194 indicates that the C - terminus of CLC is located close to the plasma membrane . In contrast , 195 EGFP - CLC showed the longest fluorescence lifetime . EGFP - CLC ∆ N showed an 196 intermediate lifetime . From these data , we can position segments of CLC relative to the 197 plane of the membrane ( Fig 3D ) . Unlike classic models 17 , we find that the N - terminus of 198 CLC bound to clathrin - coated structures at the plasma membrane is located farther into 199 8 the cytoplasm than the proximal leg of clathrin heavy chain . 200 201 To investigate conformational changes during lattice curvature , we performed FRET - 202 CLEM measurements with DPA and compared those measurement to morphological 203 changes in clathrin lattice ( Fig 3E and Fig S7 ) . In these experiments , fluorescence 204 lifetimes of EGFP - CLC increased as lattices curved , and the degree of change was larger 205 than those for CLC - EGFP . This is consistent with a model where the N - terminal position 206 of CLC changes during curvature . Thus , the combined results from EGFP - ShadowY and 207 EGFP - DPA FRET indicate that the N - terminus of CLC extends away from the CLC C - 208 terminus ( triskelion vertex ) and the plane of the plasma membrane during endocytosis 209 ( Fig 3F ) . 210 211 Conformational changes in CLC regulate lattice structure and endocytosis 212 Next , we tested whether these conformational changes in CLC regulate clathrin - mediated 213 endocytosis . To manipulate the CLC N - terminal position , we used a rapamycin inducible 214 FKBP / FRB dimerization system 49 . Specifically , we employed the T2098L mutant of FRB 215 which is heterodimerized to FKBP by the rapamycin analog , AP21967 50 . We attached 216 FKBP to the N - terminus of CLC , and one or two FRBs ( FRB×2 ) to the C - terminus of either 217 the membrane - bound PH domain from PLC δ 1 ( PH ) 51 ( Fig 4A ) or epsin1 52 ( Fig S8A ) . We 218 made both FRB and FRB×2 probes for the PH domain to extend the reach of the system . 219 To confirm that the N - terminal position of FKBP - EGFP - CLC changes relative to the 220 plasma membrane after dimerization , we measured EGFP fluorescence lifetimes without 221 or with AP21967 in the presence of DPA ( Fig 4 , B and C , and Fig S8B ) . Changes in the 222 position of EGFP can be estimated by comparing the difference in fluorescence lifetimes 223 between the control and DPA treated membranes ( Fig 4D and Fig S8C ) . For all three 224 probes , differences in EGFP lifetimes with AP21967 treatment were larger than those 225 without AP21967 . These results indicate that the CLC N - terminus moves towards the 226 plasma membrane as a result of FKBP / FRB dimerization . Because PH - miRFP - FRB×2 227 showed larger lifetime change ( Fig 4D ) and stronger accumulation with AP21967 than PH - 228 9 miRFP - FRB ( Fig S9A ) , we used PH - miRFP - FRB×2 and epsin1 - miRFP - FRB ( or PH - 229 mCherry - FRB×2 and epsin1 - mCherry - FRB ) to alter the structure of clathrin light chain in 230 living cells . 231 232 First , using our FKBP / FRB constructs , we investigated the impact of moving the CLC N - 233 terminus towards the plasma membrane on the structure of clathrin lattices 42 . Here , 234 unroofed membranes from cells expressing FKBP - EGFP - CLC and either PH - miRFP - 235 FRB×2 or epsin1 - miRFP - FRB and treated without or with AP21967 were imaged with 236 PREM ( Fig S10A ) . Unlike the previous homodimerization system 53 , clathrin lattices were 237 not noticeably distorted . The average size of all visible flat and domed clathrin structures 238 increased with AP21967 treatment for PH - miRFP - FRB×2 expressing cells [ 31463 ± 859 239 nm 2 ( ctrl ) and 42919 ± 2278 nm 2 ( AP ) for flat , 29821 ± 576 nm 2 ( ctrl ) and 36471 ± 2862 nm 2 240 ( AP ) for domed , 15311 ± 588 nm 2 ( ctrl ) and 17303 ± 691 nm 2 ( AP ) for sphere ] ( Fig 5 , A - C ) . 241 Although expression of the epsin1 - miRFP - FRB decreased the average clathrin - coated 242 structure size on its own , AP21967 treatment increased flat and domed clathrin areas 243 similar to the extent seen with the PH domain - based tethers ( Fig S10 , B - D ) . We conclude 244 that manipulation of the CLC N - terminal position directly effects the structure of clathrin . 245 246 Next , to investigate how changing CLC conformations effects CCS assembly and 247 maturation , we performed live cell time lapse evanescent field imaging . Cells expressing 248 FKBP - EGFP - CLC and either PH - miRFP - FRB×2 ( Fig 5 , D and E ) or epsin1 - miRFP - FRB 249 ( Fig S11 ) were imaged with TIRF in the absence or presence of AP21967 . To quantitate 250 CCS dynamics , we analyzed the residence times of FKBP - EGFP - CLC spots on the plasma 251 membrane . For PH - miRFP - FRB×2 , the residence times became shorter after AP21967 252 addition ( Fig 5 , D and E , and Fig S11B ) . Similarly , although expression of epsin1 - miRFP - 253 FRB shorten the residence times slightly , AP21967 treatment further shorten them ( Fig 254 S11 ) . These data indicate that tethering the CLC N - terminal position towards the plasma 255 membrane likely facilitates the disassembly of CCSs . 256 257 10 Finally , we investigated whether manipulation of the CLC N - terminal position effects 258 transferrin endocytosis in whole cells ( Fig 5 , F and G and Fig S12 ) . As a control for binding 259 of FRB to the CLC N - terminus , a cytosolic probe , mCherry - FRB×2 , was used . 260 Furthermore , as a control of clathrin tethering to the plasma membrane , and also FRB 261 accumulation on CCSs , a C - terminal - linked FKBP probe , CLC - FKBP - EGFP , was tested . 262 For all five probe pairs , FKBP / FRB dimerization was confirmed by clustering of FRB at 263 CCSs ( Fig S9B ) and / or changes in FRET efficiency between EGFP and mCherry ( Fig S9C ) . 264 Also , expression of these probes did not change transferrin uptake without AP21967 265 treatment ( Fig S12B ) . We found that transferrin uptake decreased with AP21967 for PH – 266 mCherry - FRB×2 but not for the control mCherry - FRB×2 ( Fig 5G ) . Further , for C - 267 terminus - attached FKBP control ( CLC - FKBP - EGFP ) , PH - mCherry - FRB×2 did not change 268 transferrin uptake ( Fig 5G ) . Although transferrin uptake of epsin1 - mCherry - FRB 269 expressing cells was decreased for both CLC N - and C - terminus - attached FKBP probes , 270 the degree of change with the C - terminus - attached FKBP was smaller than that for the N - 271 terminus - attached FKBP ( Fig S12C ) . These results indicate that although epsin1 had 272 some effect on endocytosis , likely driven by epsin’s roles in endocytosis , manipulation of 273 the CLC N - terminal position inhibited transferrin uptake . These data are consistent with 274 the decrease in the residence time of CCSs we observed in live cell imaging . From these 275 collective data , we concluded that the conformational changes in CLC we mapped in 276 FRET - CLEM experiments are key structural changes required for endocytosis of cargo - 277 loaded vesicles in mammalian cells . Thus , the movement of the N - terminal domain away 278 from the clathrin vertex and plasma membrane is a key regulatory step in clathrin - 279 mediated endocytosis . 280 281 Discussion 282 283 We have explored the molecular - scale conformational changes in clathrin light chain at 284 single clathrin sites at the plasma membrane of mammalian cells . We find that the N - 285 terminus of CLC moves away from both the triskelion vertex and the plasma membranes 286 11 as clathrin lattices curve . Blocking this movement increased clathrin lattice sizes at the 287 plasma membrane and reduced transferrin endocytosis . Thus , specific structural changes 288 in CLC in clathrin lattices at the plasma membrane are regulators of curvature and 289 endocytosis in living mammalian cells . 290 291 Conformational changes in CLC have been proposed to regulate clathrin assembly 17 . We 292 mapped the specific changes in cells by measuring vectors in two orthogonal axes . First , 293 EGFP - DPA FRET measurements positioned the light chain relative to the plane of the 294 membrane ( Fig 3D ) , and reported the movement along the axis perpendicular to the 295 plasma membrane ( Fig 3F ) . Unlike classic in vitro models 17 , we find that the N - terminus 296 of CLC is located farther into the cytoplasm than the proximal leg of clathrin heavy chain 297 and moves away from the membrane . With intermolecular FRET between EGFP and 298 ShadowY ( Fig 2 ) at the N - and C - terminus of the light chain , we could map structures 299 along the axis parallel to the plasma membrane . Here again , we detected a displacement 300 of the N - terminal domain away from the CLC C - terminus ( clathrin lattice vertex ) . 301 Combined , these data indicate that the N - terminus of CLC moves away from both the 302 clathrin vertex and the plane of the plasma membrane as lattices gain curvature . 303 304 Although the exact position of the N - terminus in relation to the heavy chain proximal leg 305 domain was not determined , our experiments could be used to provide additional insights . 306 Specifically , we modeled how FRET efficiencies between EGFP - CLC / CLC - ShadowY ( Fig 307 S4B ) or EGFP - CLC / ShadowY - CLC ( Fig S4G ) would change as the N - terminal position 308 changes according to the x - ray structures 17 across all possible spatial positions ( Fig S13A ) . 309 Although the expression level of ShadowY could affect the overall gross efficiency of FRET , 310 the positional dependency , and direction of change , would not change with expression 311 levels according to our calculations . Because FRET efficiencies were largely similar for 312 both sites , the N - terminus of CLC is predicted to rest in the overlap regions that match 313 these paired distances ( Fig S13B , magenta circles ) . To accommodate these constraints , 314 CLC would assume a slightly folded conformation ( orange and green in Fig S13C ) rather 315 12 than a stretched conformation ( blue in Fig S13C ) . Thus , we propose a new model of CLC 316 conformational changes ( Fig 6 ) . Here , CLC assumes an extended and tightly bound 317 conformation in unassembled triskelia in the cytoplasm similar to that seen in x - ray 318 crystal structures and measured with FRET 17 . Next , when CLC assembles at the 319 membrane as a flat lattice , the light chain changes conformations from this extended 320 position into a new folded conformation . The N - terminus is then displaced deeper into the 321 cytosol as clathrin lattices curve into vesicles . In support of our data , the average position 322 of the CLC N - terminal domain is not visible by cryo - EM in purified clathrin - coated 323 vesicles 45 . This suggests that the N - terminal domain is flexible and positioned away from 324 the lattice in highly curved structures . 325 326 What initiates this structural change in the light chain ? HIP and HIP1R interact with the 327 CLC N - terminal residues 54 , 55 . Although CLC QQN mutants are deficient in binding HIP1 328 and HIP1R 55 , we found that FRET between the N - and C - terminus of the CLC QQN 329 mutant showed FRET changes comparable to wild type proteins ( Fig 2 , D and F ) . Thus , if 330 this region is necessary for binding , HIP1R interactions are unlikely to drive these 331 conformational changes . The roles of other proteins 16 , 23 or phosphorylation 20 are alternate 332 mechanisms that could drive this change . Finally , non - specific physical mechanisms such 333 as crowding and cargo binding could induce the conformational switch 2 , 13 . 334 335 In vitro studies have shown that CLC increases the rigidity of clathrin lattices on a solid 336 substrate 19 . These effects were different between different CLC isoforms 22 . In living cells , 337 CLC has been shown to be important for endocytosis under conditions of high membrane 338 tension 18 , 21 . Here , our FKBP / FRB experiments demonstrate that conformational changes 339 in CLC regulate the structure of clathin ( Fig 5 A - C ) , the dynamics of single clathrin sites 340 in live cells ( Fig 5 D and E ) , and the endocytosis of cargo in whole cells ( Fig 5F and G ) . One 341 possible interpretation is that the lattice can grow but not fully curve due to the inhibition 342 of the CLC conformation switch . Possibly , clathrin lattices grow larger because treatment 343 disturbed the balance between lattice assembly and curvature 12 . These irregularly - 344 13 assembled CCSs are then disassembled by proofreading mechanisms 3 . The CLCs role in 345 endocytosis differs between isoforms , cargos , and cell types 18 , 20 - 22 , 56 - 59 and the 346 physiological function of CLC are not fully understood 16 , 23 . Clarification on how CLC 347 conformations are regulated across isoforms and cargos will provide a unified view of the 348 light chain’s mechanistic roles across different cells , tissues , and states . 349 350 We used a PH domain ( Fig 4 ) and epsin1 - linked FRB proteins ( Fig S8 ) to manipulate the 351 position of the CLC N - terminus . Both constructs changed the N - terminal position of CLC 352 and modified the structure and dynamics of CCSs ( Figs 5 , S10 , S11 and S12 ) . The 353 directions of change were similar . However , expressing epsin1 - miRFP - FRB measurably 354 decreased the size of CCSs ( Figs 5B , S10C , and S14C ) and shortened the residence time 355 ( Fig S11 ) . This structural change is consistent with previous studies indicating membrane 356 bending by molecular crowding of epsin1’s disordered domains 60 , 61 . Thus , attaching 357 miRFP - FRB to a disordered domain might facilitate membrane bending in cells . Changes 358 in clathrin lattice size by interactions between FKBP - EGFP - CLC and epsin1 - miRFP - FRB 359 might be induced by both inhibition of CLC - conformational changes and structural 360 changes in disordered domains of epsin1 . Future work is needed to disentangle these 361 effects . 362 363 Our work has some specific limitations . For example , we transiently expressed FP - tagged 364 probes to measure FRET . Thus , the expression ratio between endogenous and FP - labeled 365 proteins could affects the overall FRET efficiency ( Fig S1D and S13A ) . This , along with 366 other photophysical issues , makes it difficult to convert FRET efficiencies to absolute 367 atomic distances 62 . However , the differences in expression level do not affect the direction 368 of FRET changes caused by conformational changes in this system ( Fig S1D and S13A ) . In 369 the future , dual - tagging all alleles of the endogenous protein is a direction to further refine 370 these measurements 30 . Furthermore , the size of fluorescent proteins , while relatively 371 small compared to the size of the clathrin complex and approaching the size of large red 372 organic dyes , may affect a protein’s structure . Likewise , larger probes can limit the ability 373 14 to detect small or distant conformational changes 62 . Thus , the incorporation of smaller 374 tags or artificial amino acids are future directions to improve these measurements 63 , 64 . 375 Indeed , smaller probes have been shown to better recapitulate absolute distance changes 376 seen during conformational transitions and might have less of an influence on the proteins 377 themselves 28 . In the case of clathrin light chain , however , fusion of fluorescent proteins has 378 not been seen to perturb endocytosis or change clathrin lattice structures 65 . 379 380 FRET efficiencies are determined by photophysical properties ( excitation , emission , 381 absorbance ) , distance , and orientation of the probes 27 , 43 . Here , we used a flexible linker to 382 connect the FPs to CLC . Thus , it is reasonable to propose that the population of FPs in a 383 CCS can assume many possible orientations and the effect of an orientation bias would be 384 small . However , we cannot exclude the small possibility that the curvature of clathrin 385 lattices causes differences in the orientations between the donor and acceptor , which may 386 affect the overall FRET efficiencies . However , the fact that the N - terminal changes was 387 observed in both two FP - FRET experiments and FP - DPA FRET experiments , supports the 388 idea that orientation effects are not large or dominant . Combined , these caveats make it 389 difficult to directly equate FRET efficiencies to atomic distances . This is commonly the 390 case in FRET studies done within cells 62 . 391 392 For cells expressing only EGFP probes , although there were no substantial change in 393 fluorescence lifetimes among different lattice structures , clathrin vesicles tended to show 394 slightly higher lifetimes than flat clathrin structures ( Fig 2 ) . Because Homo - FRET does 395 not change the overall fluorescence lifetime 43 , this might be caused by a difference in the 396 local environment 66 , or a systematic counting error due to the differences in the photon 397 count rate among CCSs with different fluorophore densities 67 . These effects , however , were 398 small and consistent across samples . 399 400 We developed a new correlative FLIM - FRET and PREM method to track the 401 conformational changes in CLC at single sites of endocytosis in cells . The N - terminus of 402 15 CLC makes a dramatic movement away from the clathrin lattice vertex and deeper into 403 the cytosol as lattices curve . These conformational dynamics are key for clathrin - mediated 404 endocytosis . These data , combined with the rich biochemical , functional , genetic , and 405 biophysical information on membrane traffic , will lead to a more robust understanding of 406 how endocytic proteins work together during clathrin - mediated endocytosis to drive the 407 internalization of cargo . More generally , our new method maps molecular interactions and 408 conformational changes at targeted proteins at identified sites in the complex environment 409 of the cell’s plasma membrane . Thus , FRET - CLEM can be used to investigate 410 conformational changes of any accessible membrane - associated protein including ion 411 channels , transporters , receptors , adhesion proteins , or enzymes , in the context of their 412 local plasma membrane environments 28 , 31 . 413 414 Materials and Methods 415 Cell culture 416 HeLa cells ( ATCC , CCL - 2 ) were maintained at 37°C , with 5 % CO 2 in DMEM ( Gibco , 417 11995073 ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( ATLANTA biological , S12450H ) 418 and 1 % vol / vol penicillin / streptomycin ( Invitrogen , 15070 - 063 ) . The cells were placed on 419 poly - L - lysine coated coverslips ( Neuvitro , GG - 25 - 1 . 5 - PLL ) . They were transfected with 420 0 . 75 mL of Opti - MEM ( Life Technologies , 31985062 ) , 3 . 8 µ L Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life 421 Technologies , 11668027 ) , and 1 . 5 µ g of DNA for 3 h after being introduced to the cells . 422 Then , transfected cells were incubated in DMEM growth medium for 20 - 30 h before 423 unroofing or imaging . The cells were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination . 424 425 Plasmids 426 ShadowY ( # 104621 ) , mScarlet - I ( # 85068 ) , mTurquoise2 ( # 54842 ) , miRFP703 - CLCb 427 ( # 79997 ) , CFP - FKBP ( # 20160 ) were purchased from Addgene . CLCa - GFP was kindly 428 donated by Dr . W . Almer ( Oregon Health & Science University ) . Lyn - GFP - FRB was kindly 429 donated by Dr . T . Inoue ( Johns Hopkins University ) . mNeonGreen was kindly donated by 430 Dr . J . Shah ( Harvard University ) . mCherry - PH and epsin1 - dGFP were from our previous 431 16 studies 4 , 68 . All plasmids used in this study were constructed using either Q5 Site Directed 432 Mutagenesis Kit ( New England Biolabs , E0554S ) or In - Fusion HD Cloning Plus 433 ( Clonetech , 638920 ) following manufacturer’s instructions . N - and C - terminal disordered 434 regions of FPs were deleted . And proteins of interest and either FPs , FKBP , or FRB were 435 connected with a short flexible linker ( GGSGGS ) . All plasmids were confirmed by 436 sequencing ( Psomagen ) and identified as in Table S1 . 437 438 Fixing and unroofing 439 Cells were rinsed in intracellular buffer ( 70 mM KCl , 30 mM HEPES maintained at pH 7 . 4 440 with KOH , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 3mM EGTA ) , and manually unroofed with 19 - gauge needle and 441 syringe using 2 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , 15710 ) in the 442 intracellular buffer . After unroofing , the coverslips were transferred to fresh 2 % 443 paraformaldehyde in the intracellular buffer for 20 min . They then washed with 444 phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . Imaging was performed in PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) ( Quality 445 Biological , 114 - 058 - 131 ) . 446 447 For FKBP / FRB dimerization experiments , cells were unroofed after 15 min incubation 448 with 500 nM AP21967 ( 500 µ M stock in ethanol ) ( Takara , 635055 ) or 0 . 1 % w / v ethanol 449 ( control ) in DMEM growth medium . 450 451 Imaging of unroofed plasma membranes for CLEM 452 Unroofed cells were stained either with 16 . 5 pmol of Alexa Fluor 350 - phalloidin ( Life 453 Technologies , A22281 ) , Alexa Fluor 568 - phalloidin ( Life Technologies , A12380 ) , or Alexa 454 Fluor 647 - phalloidin ( Life Technologies , A22287 ) for 15 min depending on spectra of 455 expressing FPs . Then cells were rinsed with PBS . 1 mm × 1 mm large montage was 456 generated for proteins of interest and phalloidin using a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted 457 microscope with a 100× , 1 . 49 NA objective ( Nikon , SR HP Apo TIRF ) and an Andor iXon 458 Ultra 897 EM - CCD camera under the control of Nikon Elements software . Images were 459 obtained by TIRF illumination except for Alexa Fluor 350 which was imaged by epi 460 17 illumination . This map was used to find the cells expressing the target proteins for FLIM 461 and CLEM analysis . The imaged area was marked with a circle ( 4 mm in diameter ) 462 around the center of the imaged area using an objective diamond scriber ( Leica , 463 11505059 ) 39 , 69 . The immersion oil was carefully removed from the bottom of the glass 464 coverslip . The sample was subsequently imaged by FLIM or stored in 2 % glutaraldehyde 465 ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , 16019 ) at 4°C until EM sample preparation . 466 467 FLIM 468 Time - domain fluorescence lifetime imaging was performed with a Leica Falcon SP8 469 confocal microscope with a 63× , 1 . 40 NA oil immersion objective ( Leica , HC PL APO CS2 ) . 470 As first , a large image montage around the region of interest on the coverslip marked by a 471 diamond scriber was acquired to find the cells which were identified in the TIRF montage . 472 Then , FLIM images were collected at a lateral spatial resolution of 80 nm per pixel and 473 with a scan speed at 3 . 16 µ s per pixel . The confocal aperture was set at a diameter of 168 474 µ m ( 2 AU @ 510 nm ) . EGFP was excited by 488 nm and 498 - 560 nm fluorescence was 475 collected . A notch filter for 488 nm was used . To reduce the impact of pile - up effect , an 476 excitation power was set to keep peak count per pulse as less than 0 . 1 . For CLEM , the 477 imaged sample was then stored in 2 % glutaraldehyde at 4°C until EM sample preparation . 478 479 To select a FP pair for FLIM - FRET , we made tandemly connected FPs and compared their 480 FRET efficiency ( Fig S2A ) . Based on its high FRET efficiency and compatibility for our 481 optical systems , we selected monomeric EGFP and ShadowY ( Fig S2B ) . To check the 482 relationship between the number of frames and photobleaching or FRET efficiency change , 483 fluorescence intensity and FRET efficiency of EGFP - ShadowY - CLC was compared with 484 various frame numbers ( Fig S3 , E and F ) . Fluorescence intensity slightly increased and 485 FRET efficiency slightly decreased as the frame number increases . This might be due to 486 photobleaching of ShadowY occurs faster than EGFP . Although the magnitude of ShadowY 487 photobleaching should be smaller for lower FRET efficiency situation like intermolecular 488 FRET , we used 150 frames to minimize the effect of photobleaching . With 150 frames , 489 18 ~ 10 , 000 photon counts per single CCS were obtained in average from a cell with medium 490 level expression ( Fig S3G ) . With this range of photon counts , FRET efficiency ( E ) of EGFP - 491 ShadowY - CLC from single CCS could be estimated by fitting a fluorescence decay curve 492 with a bi - exponential function convolved with the Gaussian pulse response function 70 ( Fig 493 S3H ) . 494 𝐹𝐹 ( 𝑡𝑡 ) = 𝐹𝐹 0 [ 𝑃𝑃 1 𝐻𝐻 ( 𝑡𝑡 , 𝑡𝑡 0 , 𝜏𝜏 1 , 𝜏𝜏 𝐺𝐺 ) + ( 1 − 𝑃𝑃 1 ) 𝐻𝐻 ( 𝑡𝑡 , 𝑡𝑡 0 , 𝜏𝜏 2 , 𝜏𝜏 𝐺𝐺 ) ] ( 1 ) 495 𝐻𝐻 ( 𝑡𝑡 , 𝑡𝑡 0 , 𝜏𝜏 1 , 𝜏𝜏 𝐺𝐺 ) = 1 2 exp � 𝜏𝜏 𝐺𝐺2 2𝜏𝜏 1 − 𝑡𝑡−𝑡𝑡 0 𝜏𝜏 1 � erfc � 𝜏𝜏 𝐺𝐺2 −𝜏𝜏 1 ( 𝑡𝑡−𝑡𝑡 0 ) √2𝜏𝜏 1 𝜏𝜏 𝐺𝐺 � ( 2 ) 496 where F ( t ) is the fluorescence lifetime decay curve , F 0 is the peak fluorescence before 497 convolution , P 1 is the fraction of the first component , τ 1 and τ 2 are the fluorescence lifetime 498 of first and second components , τ G is the width of the Gaussian pulse response function , t 0 499 is time offset , and erfc is the complementary error function . 500 𝜏𝜏 𝑎𝑎 = 𝑃𝑃 1 𝜏𝜏 1 + ( 1 − 𝑃𝑃 1 ) 𝜏𝜏 2 ( 3 ) 501 𝐸𝐸 = 1 − 𝜏𝜏 𝑎𝑎 , 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝜏𝜏 𝑎𝑎 , 𝐷𝐷 ( 4 ) 502 where τ a is amplitude - weighted fluorescence lifetime , τ a , D is amplitude - weighted 503 fluorescence lifetime of the donor without acceptor , and τ a , DA is amplitude - weighted 504 fluorescence lifetime of the donor in presence of the acceptor 43 . Values from single CCSs 505 ( Fig S3H ) were consistent with those from whole plasma membrane ( Fig S3 , A - C ) . 506 However , in general , nearly 10 , 000 photon counts are required to fit a bi - exponential 44 , 71 . 507 So , curve - fitting on the fluorescence decay curves from very small CCSs will not be 508 adequate . Thus , instead to estimate FRET efficiency through curve - fitting , mean 509 fluorescence lifetime , the center mass of the fluorescence lifetime decay , was used as an 510 indicator for FRET efficiency ( Fig 1D and Fig S3D ) . 511 512 For FLIM measurements with dipicrylamine ( DPA ; City Chemical LLC ) , a 20 mM stock 513 solution of DPA in DMSO ( Sigma - Aldrich , D2650 ) was prepared fresh from powder every 514 day and diluted to a final concentration with PBS . Imaging was performed at least 10 min 515 after addition of DPA . FRET efficiency between DPA and miRFP should be very low 516 because DPA absorbance spectra and miRFP emission spectra are sufficiently separated 517 19 ( Fig S2C ) . 518 519 For live cell FLIM imaging ( Fig S6 ) , cells were imaged in imaging buffer ( 130 mM NaCl , 520 2 . 8 mM KCl , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES , and 10 mM glucose at pH 7 . 4 ) at 521 21°C . 522 523 Platinum replica EM 524 EM samples were prepared as described previously 4 , 69 . Coverslips were transferred from 525 glutaraldehyde into 0 . 1 % w / v tannic acid for 20 min . Then , they were rinsed 4 times with 526 water , and placed in 0 . 1 % w / v uranyl acetate for 20 min . The coverslips were then 527 dehydrated , critical point dried with a critical point dryer ( Tousimis Samdri , 795 ) , and 528 coated with platinum and carbon with a Freeze fracture ( Leica , EM ACE 900 ) . The region 529 of interest on the coverslip marked by a diamond scriber was imaged with a 20× phase - 530 contrast objective to obtain another map of the region imaged in fluorescence . The replicas 531 were lifted and placed onto Formvar / carbon - coated 75 - mesh copper TEM grids ( Ted Pella , 532 01802 - F ) that were freshly glow - discharged with PELCO easiGlow 91000 . Again , the grid 533 was imaged with a 20× phase - contrast objective to find the same region that was originally 534 imaged in fluorescence . Each cell of interest was located on the grid prior to EM imaging 39 . 535 TEM imaging was performed as previously described 36 at ×15 , 000 magnification ( 1 . 2 nm 536 per pixel ) using a JEOL 1400 and SerialEM freeware for montaging 72 . Electron microscopy 537 montages were processed using IMOD freeware 73 . 538 539 FRET - CLEM image analysis 540 The FLIM images were aligned to the EM images using an affine spatial transformation 541 with nearest - neighbor interpolation to map the CCSs visible in both FLIM images and EM 542 images 35 , 40 . Since position of sphere clathrin is sometimes changed during critical point 543 drying due to a weak attachment to the membrane , we used flat and domed clathrin as 544 fiducials 69 . Rectangular ROI was created around single isolated CCS , and mean 545 fluorescence lifetime within each ROI was calculated . These values were analyzed by 546 20 categorizing according to lattice structures , and were compared to average value of flat 547 clathrin for each unroofed membrane . This is because FRET efficiencies , and thus 548 fluorescence lifetimes , varied among cells due to the differences in expression levels of 549 doner and acceptor probes , or incorporated density of DPA ( Figs S4 , S5 and S7 ) . 550 551 For FRET between EGFP and ShadowY , because ShadowY expression cannot be confirmed 552 with fluorescence , only cells with cellular average fluorescence lifetime of less than 2 . 1 ns 553 were analyzed to ensure expression of ShadowY . 554 555 EM image analysis 556 Binary masks of the flat ( no visible curvature ) , domed ( curved but can still see the edge of 557 the lattice ) , and sphere clathrin ( curved beyond a hemisphere such that the edge of the 558 lattice is no longer visible ) were manually segmented ( Fig S14A ) 42 , 74 . The percentage of 559 occupied membrane area was defined as the sum of areas from clathrin lattices of the 560 specified subtype divided by the total area of measured membrane . Transient expression of 561 CLC probes did not change the size of clathrin lattice structures but changed the density 562 of CCS slightly ( Fig S14 , B - D ) . 563 564 Transferrin uptake assay 565 HeLa cells were incubated in starvation medium [ DMEM containing 20 mM HEPES at pH 566 7 . 4 and 0 . 1 % w / v bovine serum albumin ( Fisher Bioreagents , BP9703 ) ] for 1h in an CO 2 567 incubator . They were then incubated with 500 nM AP21967 or 0 . 1 % w / v ethanol ( control ) 568 in starvation medium for 5min . Then , 25 mg / mL Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated human 569 transferrin ( Invitrogen , T23366 ) was added to the starvation medium 75 . After 15 min 570 incubation , the cells were fixed with 2 % paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 25 571 min . They then washed with PBS . The cells were imaged with a Leica Falcon SP8 confocal 572 microscope with a 63× , 1 . 40 NA oil immersion objective . Images were collected at a lateral 573 spatial resolution of 120 nm per pixel . The confocal aperture was set at a diameter of 191 574 µ m , and optical sections with z - spacing of 0 . 8 µ m were collected . Alexa Fluor 647 was 575 21 excited by 633 nm and 638 - 800 nm fluorescence was collected . 576 577 The stack images were recombined using a sum - intensity operation . And background 578 intensity from non - cell regions were subtracted . Then , cell outlines were traced manually 579 and the mean intensity ( total intensity / area ) was measured for individual cells . 580 Fluorescence intensity was normalized by the average value of non - transfected cells for 581 each coverslip . 582 583 Live cell TIRF imaging and analysis 584 Images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope with a 100× , 1 . 49 NA 585 objective and an Andor iXon Ultra 897 EM - CCD camera . HeLa cells in the phenol red free 586 DMEM growth medium [ DMEM ( Gibco , 31053036 ) with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 1 : 100 587 dilution of 100× GlutaMAX ( Gibco , 35050061 ) , 1 : 100 dilution of 100 mM sodium pyruvate 588 ( Gibco , 11360070 ) ] were mounted in a chamber at 37°C with a water bath and continuous 589 flow of humidified 5 % CO 2 to maintain the osmolality and pH of the medium . Pixel size 590 was 110 nm . TIRF images were acquired with 100 ms exposures at 0 . 5 Hz for 10 min . For 591 AP21967 treatment , images were acquired at least 10 min after addition of 500 nM 592 AP21967 . 593 594 FKBP - EGFP - CLC spots were tracked using the ImageJ plugin TrackMate 76 . Spot 595 detection was done with the difference of Gaussians approach , and tracking was done 596 using the simple linear assignment problem ( LAP ) tracker algorithm with a linking 597 maximum distance of 330 nm per frame . Tracks that appeared and disappeared during the 598 whole movie with over 20 s duration , and that total net displacement was less than 330 599 nm were selected for residence time analysis . Further , each track was visually inspected 600 for isolation and tracking errors . 601 602 FRET simulation 603 FRET simulations ( Fig S1D and S13 ) were performed using MATLAB . We used 60 Å for 604 22 Förster radius for EGFP - ShadowY FRET . For the simulation in Fig S1D , we determined 605 the position of N - and C - terminal positions of CLC according to the structure model ( PDB 606 3LVG and 6WCJ ) 17 , 45 . For the simulation in Fig S13 , lateral position of N - terminus was 607 moved by 0 . 6 Å spacing , and N - terminus was assumed to locate axially 25 Å higher than 608 C - terminus . FRET efficiency between EGFP - CLC and surrounding five CLC - ShadowY , or 609 FRET efficiency between EGFP - CLC and opposite ShadowY - CLC was calculated at 610 different expression levels in ShadowY probes ( CLC - ShadowY or ShadowY - CLC ) . 611 Expression level = [ ShadowY probe ] [ Endogenous CLC ] + [ EGFP−CLC ] + [ ShadowY probe ] ( 5 ) 612 613 Quantification and Statistical Analysis 614 Image analysis and quantification were performed with ImageJ 77 and MATLAB . The 615 statistical tests used for each experiment and the exact sample numbers ( n values ) are 616 indicated in the corresponding figure legends . p values of < 0 . 05 were considered 617 statistically significant . All statistical analysis and fitting were performed using Origin 618 2016 ( Origin Lab ) . 619 620 621 Acknowledgments 622 We thank Dr . L . D .
