1 09 - 91 SCI AMER WEISER Scientific American Ubicomp Paper after Sci Am editing The Computer for the 21st Century Mark Weiser The most profound technologies are those that disappear . They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it . Consider writing , perhaps the first information technology : The ability to capture a symbolic representation of spoken language for long - term storage freed information from the limits of individual memory . Today this technology is ubiquitous in industrialized countries . Not only do books , magazines and newspapers convey written information , but so do street signs , billboards , shop signs and even graffiti . Candy wrappers are covered in writing . The constant background presence of these products of " literacy technology " does not require active attention , but the information to be conveyed is ready for use at a glance . It is difficult to imagine modern life otherwise . Silicon - based information technology , in contrast , is far from having become part of the environment . More than 50 million personal computers have been sold , and nonetheless the computer remains largely in a world of its own . It is approachable only through complex jargon that has nothing to do with the tasks for which which people actually use computers . The state of the art is perhaps analogous to the period when scribes had to know as much about making ink or baking clay as they did about writing . The arcane aura that surrounds personal computers is not just a " user interface " problem . My colleagues and I at PARC think that the idea of a " personal " computer itself is misplaced , and that the vision of laptop machines , dynabooks and " knowledge navigators " is only a transitional step toward achieving the real potential of information technology . Such machines cannot truly make computing an integral , invisible part of the way people live their lives . Therefore we are trying to conceive a new way of thinking about computers in the world , one that takes into account the natural human environment and allows the computers themselves to vanish into the background . Such a disappearance is a fundamental consequence not of technology , but of human psychology . Whenever people learn something sufficiently well , they cease to be aware of it . When you look at a street sign , for example , you absorb its information without consciously performing the act of reading . . Computer scientist , economist , and Nobelist Herb Simon calls this phenomenon " compiling " ; philosopher Michael Polanyi calls it the " tacit dimension " ; psychologist TK Gibson calls it " visual invariants " ; philosophers Georg Gadamer and Martin Heidegger call it " the horizon " and the " ready - to - hand " , John Seely Brown at PARC calls it the " periphery " . All say , in essence , that 2 only when things disappear in this way are we freed to use them without thinking and so to focus beyond them on new goals . The idea of integrating computers seamlessly into the world at large runs counter to a number of present - day trends . " Ubiquitous computing " in this context does not just mean computers that can be carried to the beach , jungle or airport . Even the most powerful notebook computer , with access to a worldwide information network , still focuses attention on a single box . By analogy to writing , carrying a super - laptop is like owning just one very important book . Customizing this book , even writing millions of other books , does not begin to capture the real power of literacy . Furthermore , although ubiquitous computers may employ sound and video in addition to text and graphics , that does not make them " multimedia computers . " Today ' s multimedia machine makes the computer screen into a demanding focus of attention rather than allowing it to fade into the background . Perhaps most diametrically opposed to our vision is the notion of " virtual reality , " which attempts to make a world inside the computer . Users don special goggles that project an artificial scene on their eyes ; they wear gloves or even body suits that sense their motions and gestures so that they can move about and manipulate virtual objects . Although it may have its purpose in allowing people to explore realms otherwise inaccessible - - the insides of cells , the surfaces of distant planets , the information web of complex databases - - virtual reality is only a map , not a territory . It excludes desks , offices , other people not wearing goggles and body suits , weather , grass , trees , walks , chance encounters and in general the infinite richness of the universe . Virtual reality focuses an enormous apparatus on simulating the world rather than on invisibly enhancing the world that already exists . Indeed , the opposition between the notion of virtual reality and ubiquitous , invisible computing is so strong that some of us use the term " embodied virtuality " to refer to the process of drawing computers out of their electronic shells . The " virtuality " of computer - readable data - - all the different ways in which it can be altered , processed and analyzed - - is brought into the physical world . How do technologies disappear into the background ? The vanishing of electric motors may serve as an instructive example : At the turn of the century , a typical workshop or factory contained a single engine that drove dozens or hundreds of different machines through a system of shafts and pulleys . Cheap , small , efficient electric motors made it possible first to give each machine or tool its own source of motive force , then to put many motors into a single machine . A glance through the shop manual of a typical automobile , for example , reveals twenty - two motors and twenty - five more solenoids . They start the engine , clean the windshield , lock and unlock the doors , and so on . By paying careful attention it might be possible to know whenever one activated a motor , but there would be no point to it . 3 Most of the computers that participate in embodied virtuality will be invisible in fact as well as in metaphor . Already computers in light switches , thermostats , stereos and ovens help to activate the world . These machines and more will be interconnected in a ubiquitous network . As computer scientists , however , my colleagues and I have focused on devices that transmit and display information more directly . We have found two issues of crucial importance : location and scale . Little is more basic to human perception than physical juxtaposition , and so ubiquitous computers must know where they are . ( Today ' s computers , in contrast , have no idea of their location and surroundings . ) If a computer merely knows what room it is in , it can adapt its behavior in significant ways without requiring even a hint of artificial intelligence . Ubiquitous computers will also come in different sizes , each suited to a particular task . My colleagues and I have built what we call tabs , pads and boards : inch - scale machines that approximate active Post - It notes , foot - scale ones that behave something like a sheet of paper ( or a book or a magazine ) , and yard - scale displays that are the equivalent of a blackboard or bulletin board . How many tabs , pads , and board - sized writing and display surfaces are there in a typical room ? Look around you : at the inch scale include wall notes , titles on book spines , labels on controls , thermostats and clocks , as well as small pieces of paper . Depending upon the room you may see more than a hundred tabs , ten or twenty pads , and one or two boards . This leads to our goals for initially deploying the hardware of embodied virtuality : hundreds of computers per room . Hundreds of computers in a room could seem intimidating at first , just as hundreds of volts coursing through wires in the walls did at one time . But like the wires in the walls , these hundreds of computers will come to be invisible to common awareness . People will simply use them unconsciously to accomplish everyday tasks . Tabs are the smallest components of embodied virtuality . Because they are interconnected , tabs will expand on the usefulness of existing inch - scale computers such as the pocket calculator and the pocket organizer . Tabs will also take on functions that no computer performs today . For example , Olivetti Cambridge Research Labs pioneered active badges , and now computer scientists at PARC and other research laboratories around the world are working with these clip - on computers roughly the size of an employee ID card . These badges can identify themselves to receivers placed throughout a building , thus making it possible to keep track of the people or objects to which they are attached . In our experimental embodied virtuality , doors open only to the right badge wearer , rooms greet people by name , telephone calls can be automatically forwarded to wherever the recipient may be , receptionists actually know where people are , computer terminals retrieve the preferences of whoever is sitting at them , and appointment diaries write themselves . No revolution in artificial intelligence is needed - - just the proper imbedding of computers into the everday world . The automatic diary shows how 4 such a simple thing as knowing where people are can yield complex dividends : meetings , for example , consist of several people spending time in the same room , and the subject of a meeting is most likely the files called up on that room ' s display screen while the people are there . My colleague Roy Want has designed a tab incorporating a small display that can serve simultaneously as an active badge , calendar and diary . It will also act as an extension to computer screens : instead of shrinking a program window down to a small icon on the screen , for example , a user will be able to shrink the window onto a tab display . This will leave the screen free for information and also let people arrange their computer - based projects in the area around their terminals , much as they now arrange paper - based projects in piles on desks and tables . Carrying a project to a different office for discussion is a simple as gathering up its tabs ; the associated programs and files can be called up on any terminal . The next step up in size is the pad , something of a cross between a sheet of paper and current laptop and palmtop computers . Bob Krivacic at PARC has built a prototype pad that uses two microprocessors , a workstation - sized display , a multi - button stylus , and a radio network that can potentially handle hundreds of devices per person per room . Pads differ from conventional portable computers in one crucial way . Whereas portable computers go everywhere with their owners , the pad that must be carried from place to place is a failure . Pads are intended to be " scrap computers " ( analogous to scrap paper ) that can be grabbed and used anywhere ; they have no individualized identity or importance . One way to think of pads is as an antidote to windows . Windows were invented at PARC and popularized by Apple in the Macintosh as a way of fitting several different activities onto the small space of a computer screen at the same time . In twenty years computer screens have not grown much larger . Computer window systems are often said to be based on the desktop metaphor - - but who would ever use a desk whose surface area is only 9 " by 11 " ? Pads , in contrast , use a real desk . Spread many electronic pads around on the desk , just as you spread out papers . Have many tasks in front of you and use the pads as reminders . Go beyond the desk to drawers , shelves , coffee tables . Spread the many parts of the many tasks of the day out in front of you to fit both the task and the reach of your arms and eyes , rather than to fit the limitations of CRT glass - blowing . Someday pads may even be as small and light as actual paper , but meanwhile they can fulfill many more of paper ' s functions than can computer screens . Yard - size displays ( boards ) serve a number of purposes : in the home , video screens and bulletin boards ; in the office , bulletin boards , whiteboards or flip charts . A board might also serve as an electronic bookcase from which one might download texts to a pad or tab . For the time being , however , the ability to pull out a book and place it comfortably on one ' s lap remains one of the many attractions of paper . Similar 5 objections apply to using a board as a desktop ; people will have to get used to using pads and tabs on a desk as an adjunct to computer screens before taking embodied virtuality even further . Boards built by Richard Bruce and Scott Elrod at PARC currently measure about 40 by 60 inches and display 1024x768 black - and - white pixels . To manipulate the display , users pick up a piece of wireless electronic " chalk " that can work either in contact with the surface or from a distance . Some researchers , using themselves and their coleagues as guinea pigs , can hold electronically mediated meetings or engage in other forms of collaboration around a liveboard . Others use the boards as testbeds for improved display hardware , new " chalk " and interactive software . For both obvious and subtle reasons , the software that animates a large , shared display and its electronic chalk is not the same as that for a workstation . Switching back and forth between chalk and keyboard may involve walking several steps , and so the act is qualitatively different from using a keyboard and mouse . In addition , body size is an issue - - not everyone can reach the top of the board , so a Macintosh - style menu bar may not be a good idea . We have built enough liveboards to permit casual use : they have been placed in ordinary conference rooms and open areas , and no one need sign up or give advance notice before using them . By building and using these boards , researchers start to experience and so understand a world in which computer interaction casually enhances every room . Liveboards can usefully be shared across rooms as well as within them . In experiments instigated by Paul Dourish of EuroPARC and Sara Bly and Frank Halasz of PARC , groups at widely separated sites gathered around boards - - each displaying the same image - - and jointly composed pictures and drawings . They have even shared two boards across the Atlantic . Liveboards can also be used as bulletin boards . There is already too much data for people to read and comprehend all of it , and so Marvin Theimer and David Nichols at PARC have built a prototype system that attunes its public information to the people reading it . Their " scoreboard " requires little or no interaction from the user other than to look and to wear an active badge . Prototype tabs , pads and boards are just the beginning of ubiquitous computing . The real power of the concept comes not from any one of these devices ; it emerges from the interaction of all of them . The hundreds of processors and displays are not a " user interface " like a mouse and windows , just a pleasant and effective " place " to get things done . What will be most pleasant and effective is that tabs can animate objects previously inert . They can beep to help locate mislaid papers , books or other items . File drawers can open and show the desired folder - - no searching . Tabs in library catalogs can make active maps to any book and guide searchers to it , even if it is off the shelf and on a table from the last reader . In presentations , the size of text on overhead slides , the volume of the amplified voice , even the amount of ambient light , can be determined not by accident or guess but by the desires of 6 the listeners in the room at that moment . Software tools for instant votes and consensus checking are already in specialized use in electronic meeting rooms of large corporations ; tabs can make them widespread . The technology required for ubiquitous computing comes in three parts : cheap , low - power computers that include equally convenient displays , a network that ties them all together , and software systems implementing ubiquitous applications . Current trends suggest that the first requirement will easily be met . Flat - panel displays containing 640x480 black - and - white pixels are now common . This is the standard size for PC ' s and is also about right for television . As long as laptop , palmtop and notebook computers continue to grow in popularity , display prices will fall , and resolution and quality will rise . By the end of the decade , a 1000x800 - pixel high - contrast display will be a fraction of a centimeter thick and weigh perhaps 100 grams . A small battery will provide several days of continuous use . Larger displays are a somewhat different issue . If an interactive computer screen is to match a whiteboard in usefulness , it must be viewable from arm ' s length as well as from across a room . For close viewing the density of picture elements should be no worse than on a standard computer screen , about 80 per inch . Maintaining a density of 80 pixels per inch over an area several feet on a side implies displaying tens of millions of pixels . The biggest computer screen made today has only about one fourth this capacity . Such large displays will probably be expensive , but they should certainly be available . Central - processing unit speeds , meanwhile , reached a million instructions per second in 1986 and continue to double each year . Some industry observers believe that this exponential growth in raw chip speed may begin to level off about 1994 , but that other measures of performance , including power consumption and auxiliary functions , will still improve . The 100 - gram flat - panel display , then , might be driven by a single microprocessor chip that executes a billion operations per second and contains 16 megabytes of onboard memory along with sound , video and network interfaces . Such a processor would draw , on average , a few percent of the power required by the display . Auxiliary storage devices will augment the memory capacity . Conservative extrapolation of current technology suggests that match - book size removable hard disks ( or the equivalent nonvolatile memory chips ) will store about 60 megabytes each . Larger disks containing several gigabytes of information will be standard , and terabyte storage - - roughly the capacity of the Library of Congress - - will be common . Such enormous stores will not necessarily be filled to capacity with usable information . Abundant space will , however , allow radically different strategies of information management . A terabyte of space makes deleting old files virtually unnecessary , for example . Although processors and displays should be capable of offering ubiquitous computing by the end of the decade , trends in software and network technology are more problematic . Software systems today barely take any advantage of the computer network . Trends in " distributed computing " are to 7 make networks appear like disks , memory , or other non - networked devices , rather than to exploit the unique capabilities of physical dispersion . The challenges show up in the design of operating systems and window systems . Today ' s operating sytems , like DOS and Unix , assume a relatively fixed configuration of hardware and software at their core . This makes sense for both mainframes and personal computers , because hardware or operating system software cannot reasonably be added without shutting down the machine . But in an embodied virtuality , local devices come and go , and depend upon the room and the people in it . New software for new devices may be needed at any time , and you ' ll never be able to shut off everything in the room at once . Experimental " micro - kernel " operating systems , such as those developed by Rick Rashid at Carnegie - Mellon University and Andy Tanenbaum at Vrije University in Amsterdam , offer one solution . Future operating systems based around tiny kernels of functionality may automatically shrink and grow to fit the dynamically changing needs of ubiquitous computing . Today ' s window systems , like Windows 3 . 0 and the X Window System , assume a fixed base computer on which information will be displayed . Although they can handle multiple screens , they do not do well with applications that start out in one place ( screen , computer , or room ) and then move to another . For higher performance they assume a fixed screen and input mode and use the local computer to store information about the application - - if any of these change , the window system stops working for that application . Even window systems like X that were designed for use over networks have this problem - - X still assumes that an application once started stays put . The solutions to this problem are in their infancy . Systems for shared windows , such as those from Brown University and Hewlett - Packard Corporation , help with windows , but have problems of performance , and do not work for all applications . There are no systems that do well with the diversity of inputs to be found in an embodied virtuality . A more general solution will require changing the kinds of protocols by which application programs and windows interact . The network connecting these computers has its own challenges . On the one hand , data transmission rates for both wired and wireless networks are increasing rapidly . Access to gigabit - per - second wired nets is already possible , although expensive , and will become progressively cheaper . ( Gigabit networks will seldom devote all of their bandwidth to a single data stream ; instead , they will allow enormous numbers of lower - speed transmissions to proceed simultaneously . ) Small wireless networks , based on digital cellular telephone principles , currently offer data rates between two and 10 megabits per second over a range of a few hundred meters . Low - power wireless networks transmitting 250 , 000 bits per second to each station will eventually be available commercially . On the other hand , the transparent linking of wired and wireless networks is an unsolved problem . Although some stop - gap methods have been developed , engineers must develop new communication protocols that explicitly recognize the concept of machines that 8 move in physical space . Furthermore the number of channels envisioned in most wireless network schemes is still very small , and the range large ( 50 - 100 meters ) , so that the total number of mobile devices is severely limited . The ability of such a system to support hundreds of machines in every room is out of the question . Single - room networks based on infrared or newer electromagnetic technologies have enough channel capacity for ubiquitous computers , but they can only work indoors . Present technologies would require a mobile device to have three different network connections : tiny range wireless , long range wireless , and very high speed wired . A single kind of network connection that can somehow serve all three functions has yet to be invented . Neither an explication of the principles of ubiquitous computing nor a list of the technologies involved really gives a sense of what it would be like to live in a world full of invisible widgets . To extrapolate from today ' s rudimentary fragments of embodied virtuality resembles an attempt to predict the publication of Finnegan ' s Wake after just having invented writing on clay tablets . Nevertheless the effort is probably worthwhile : Sal awakens : she smells coffee . A few minutes ago her alarm clock , alerted by her restless rolling before waking , had quietly asked " coffee ? " , and she had mumbled " yes . " " Yes " and " no " are the only words it knows . Sal looks out her windows at her neighborhood . Sunlight and a fence are visible through one , but through others she sees electronic trails that have been kept for her of neighbors coming and going during the early morning . Privacy conventions and practical data rates prevent displaying video footage , but time markers and electronic tracks on the neighborhood map let Sal feel cozy in her street . Glancing at the windows to her kids ' rooms she can see that they got up 15 and 20 minutes ago and are already in the kitchen . Noticing that she is up , they start making more noise . At breakfast Sal reads the news . She still prefers the paper form , as do most people . She spots an interesting quote from a columnist in the business section . She wipes her pen over the newspaper ' s name , date , section , and page number and then circles the quote . The pen sends a message to the paper , which transmits the quote to her office . Electronic mail arrives from the company that made her garage door opener . She lost the instruction manual , and asked them for help . They have sent her a new manual , and also something unexpected - - a way to find the old one . According to the note , she can press a code into the opener and the missing manual will find itself . In the garage , she tracks a beeping noise to where the oil - stained manual had fallen behind some boxes . Sure enough , there is the tiny tab the manufacturer had affixed in the cover to try to avoid E - mail requests like her own . On the way to work Sal glances in the foreview mirror to check the traffic . She spots a slowdown ahead , and also notices on a side street the telltale green 9 in the foreview of a food shop , and a new one at that . She decides to take the next exit and get a cup of coffee while avoiding the jam . Once Sal arrives at work , the foreview helps her to quickly find a parking spot . As she walks into the building the machines in her office prepare to log her in , but don ' t complete the sequence until she actually enters her office . On her way , she stops by the offices of four or five colleagues to exchange greetings and news . Sal glances out her windows : a grey day in silicon valley , 75 percent humidity and 40 percent chance of afternoon showers ; meanwhile , it has been a quiet morning at the East Coast office . Usually the activity indicator shows at least one spontaneous urgent meeting by now . She chooses not to shift the window on the home office back three hours - - too much chance of being caught by surprise . But she knows others who do , usually people who never get a call from the East but just want to feel involved . The telltale by the door that Sal programmed her first day on the job is blinking : fresh coffee . She heads for the coffee machine . Coming back to her office , Sal picks up a tab and " waves " it to her friend Joe in the design group , with whom she is sharing a virtual office for a few weeks . They have a joint assignment on her latest project . Virtual office sharing can take many forms - - in this case the two have given each other access to their location detectors and to each other ' s screen contents and location . Sal chooses to keep miniature versions of all Joe ' s tabs and pads in view and 3 - dimensionally correct in a little suite of tabs in the back corner of her desk . She can ' t see what anything says , but she feels more in touch with his work when noticing the displays change out of the corner of her eye , and she can easily enlarge anything if necessary . A blank tab on Sal ' s desk beeps , and displays the word " Joe " on it . She picks it up and gestures with it towards her liveboard . Joe wants to discuss a document with her , and now it shows up on the wall as she hears Joe ' s voice : " I ' ve been wrestling with this third paragraph all morning and it still has the wrong tone . Would you mind reading it ? " " No problem . " Sitting back and reading the paragraph , Sal wants to point to a word . She gestures again with the " Joe " tab onto a nearby pad , and then uses the stylus to circle the word she wants : " I think it ' s this term ' ubiquitous ' . Its just not in common enough use , and makes the whole thing sound a little formal . Can we rephrase the sentence to get rid of it ? " " I ' ll try that . Say , by the way Sal , did you ever hear from Mary Hausdorf ? " " No . Who ' s that ? " " You remember , she was at the meeting last week . She told me she was going to get in touch with you . " Sal doesn ' t remember Mary , but she does vaguely remember the meeting . She 10 quickly starts a search for meetings in the past two weeks with more than 6 people not previously in meetings with her , and finds the one . The attendees ' names pop up , and she sees Mary . As is common in meetings , Mary made some biographical information about herself available to the other attendees , and Sal sees some common background . She ' ll just send Mary a note and see what ' s up . Sal is glad Mary did not make the biography available only during the time of the meeting , as many people do . . . In addition to showing some of the ways that computers can find their way invisibly into people ' s lives , this speculation points up some of the social issues that embodied virtuality will engender . Perhaps key among them is privacy : hundreds of computers in every room , all capable of sensing people near them and linked by high - speed networks , have the potential to make totalitarianism up to now seem like sheerest anarchy . Just as a workstation on a local - area network can be programmed to intercept messages meant for others , a single rogue tab in a room could potentially record everything that happened there . Even today , although active badges and self - writing appointment diaries offer all kinds of convenience , in the wrong hands their information could be stifling . Not only corporate superiors or underlings , but overzealous government officials and even marketing firms could make unpleasant use of the same information that makes invisible computers so convenient . Fortunately , cryptographic techniques already exist to secure messages from one ubiquitous computer to another and to safeguard private information stored in networked systems . If designed into systems from the outset , these techniques can ensure that private data does not become public . A well - implemented version of ubiquitous computing could even afford better privacy protection than exists today . For example , schemes based on " digital pseudonyms " could eliminate the need to give out items of personal information that are routinely entrusted to the wires today , such as credit card number , social security number and address . Jim Morris of Carnegie - Mellon University has proposed an appealing general method for approaching these issues : build computer systems to have the same privacy safeguards as the real world , but no more , so that ethical conventions will apply regardless of setting . In the physical world , for example , burglars can break through a locked door , but they leave evidence in doing so . Computers built according to Morris ' s rule would not attempt to be utterly proof against cracker , but they would be impossible to enter without leaving the digital equivalent of fingerprints . By pushing computers into the background , embodied virtuality will make individuals more aware of the people on the other ends of their computer links . This development carries the potential to reverse the unhealthy centripetal forces that conventional personal computers have introduced into life and the workplace . Even today , people holed up in windowless offices before glowing computer screens may not see their fellows for the better part of each day . And in virtual reality , the outside world 11 and all its inhabitant effectively ceases to exist . Ubiquitous computers , in contrast , reside in the human world and pose no barrier to personal interactions . If anything , the transparent connections that they offer between different locations and times may tend to bring communities closer together . My colleagues and I at PARC believe that what we call ubiquitous computing will gradually emerge as the dominant mode of computer access over the next twenty years . Like the personal computer , ubiquitous computing will enable nothing fundamentally new , but by making everything faster and easier to do , with less strain and mental gymnastics , it will transform what is apparently possible . Desktop publishing , for example , is fundamentally not different from computer typesetting , which dates back to the mid 1960 ' s at least . But ease of use makes an enormous difference . When almost every object either contains a computer or can have a tab attached to it , obtaining information will be trivial : " Who made that dress ? Are there any more in the store ? What was the name of the designer of that suit I liked last week ? " The computing environment knows the suit you looked at for a long time last week because it knows both of your locations , and , it can retroactively find the designer ' s name even if it did not interest you at the time . Sociologically , ubiquitous computing may mean the decline of the computer addict . In the 1910 ' s and 1920 ' s many people " hacked " on crystal sets to take advantage of the new high tech world of radio . Now crystal - and - cat ' s whisker receivers are rare , because radios are ubiquitous . In addition , embodied virtuality will bring computers to the presidents of industries and countries for nearly the first time . Computer access will penetrate all groups in society . Most important , ubiquitous computers will help overcome the problem of information overload . There is more information available at our fingertips during a walk in the woods than in any computer system , yet people find a walk among trees relaxing and computers frustrating . Machines that fit the human environment , instead of forcing humans to enter theirs , will make using a computer as refreshing as taking a walk in the woods .
