[ Immune Network 2009 ; 9 ( 6 ) : 274 - 284 ] INTRODUCTION Swiprosin - 1 was first identified in human lymphocytes , pre - dominantly in CD8 ＋ lymphocytes ( 1 ) and later in immature B cells , resting and activated B cells , and non - lymphoid tis - sue , especially in the brain ( 2 ) . We have recently found that swiprosin - 1 is also expressed in mast cells and up - regulated in both in vitro cultured mast cells by phorbol ester or cross - linking of Fc ε R1 and in vivo model tissues of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and atopic dermatitis ( 3 ) . Targeted in - hibition of the specific protein kinase C ( PKC ) isotypes by siRNA revealed that PKC - β I / η are involved in the ex - pression of swiprosin - 1 in the human mast cell line HMC - 1 . In contrast , down - regulation of swiprosin - 1 by A23187 or ion - omycin suggests that calcium - signaling plays a negative role ( 3 ) . However , the functions of swiprosin - 1 in mast cells are still largely unknown . In the previous paper , we only reported that the ectopic expression of swiprosin - 1 augments PMA / A23187 - induced NF - κ B promoter activity and cytokine ex - pression including IL - 3 and IL - 8 ( 3 ) . However , the mecha - nism how swiprosin - 1 involves in the cytokine production in mast cells is not investigated . In other cell types , the only reported functions are that swiprosin - 1 is associated with lipid rafts in the immature B - cell line WEHI231 and that it partic - ipates in enhancement of BCR signals and contributes to BCR - induced apoptosis ( 2 , 4 ) . Mast cells are broadly distributed throughout mammalian tissues and play a critical role in a variety of biological re - sponses ( 5 - 7 ) . Typically , mast cells are considered in associa - tion with immediate - type hypersensitivity ( 5 ) . However , sev - eral recent reports have provided evidence for the possible participation of mast cells in more persistent , and even in chronic , inflammatory and immunological , responses ( 8 , 9 ) . Of note , a variety of cytokines including IL - 3 , IL - 4 , IL - 5 , IL - 6 , Swiprosin - 1 Regulates HMC - 1 Cytokine Expression T . P . Ramesh , et al . 275 IMMUNE NETWORK http : / / www . ksimm . or . kr Volume 9 Number 6 December 2009 IL - 8 , TNF - α , and IFN - γ ( 10 - 12 ) are produced in mast cells and play an important role in immunological processes other than IgE - mediated hypersensitivity reactions . Given the po - tential importance of mast cell - derived cytokines in physio - logical or pathological immune reactions , it is essential to un - derstand the signaling pathways and molecules involved in cytokine regulation in mast cells . Until recently , however , on - ly a limited number of reports have examined the regulatory mechanism of cytokine expression in mast cells , while the mechanism of mast cell degranulation , mediated by the high affinity IgE receptor ( Fc ε R1 ) , is relatively well characterized ( 7 ) . As part of genome - wide approaches to finding novel genes that may be involved in mast cell activation , we have pre - viously found that swiprosin - 1 is over - induced in the human mast cell line HMC - 1 stimulated with PMA / A23187 ( 3 ) . In the present study , we examined , using confocal microscopy , the three - dimensional localization of swiprosin - 1 in various cell lines , including HMC - 1 cells , 293T cells , and COS - 7 cells . We then asked whether swiprosin - 1 potentially modulates mast cell activation and cytokine expression in relation to its localization . Database mining revealed that swiprosin - 1 putatively con - tains four myristylation sites , three binding sites for SH3 do - main containing proteins , two potential EF - hand domains , and a coiled - coil domain at the C - terminus , and therefore , may have a role as a small adaptor protein involved in cal - cium signaling ( 1 ) . In accordance with this prediction , swi - prosin - 1 was implicated in phosphotyrosine - based signaling events involved in the cellular stimulation of early growth fac - tor ( EGF ) 3 and in actin rearrangement ( 13 ) . By utilizing HMC - 1 cell line , which was established from a patient with mast cell leukemia , we studied whether swiprosin - 1 involves in the expression of human cytokines and chemokines . The results presented here strongly demonstrate that swiprosin - 1 potentially acts as a regulator for cytokine expression and ac - tivation of mast cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies and reagents Goat polyclonal antibody to swiprosin - 1 was from Imgenex ( San Diego , CA ) . Antibodies to p - PI3K , p - Akt , and GFP were from Cell Signaling Technology , Inc ( Beverly , MA ) . HRP - con - jugated anti - goat , anti - rabbit , and anti - mouse IgGs were from GE Healthcare ( Chalfont St . Giles , United Kingdom ) . SB - 203580 , PD98059 , MG132 , cyclosporine A , and PP2 were pur - chased from Calbiochem - Behring ( La Jolla , CA ) . Total RNA isolation reagent was from WelPrep TM Join Bio Innovation ( Daegu , South Korea ) . Maxime RT Premix ( oligo dT primer ) , Maxime PCR PreMix , and a plasmid purification kit were from iNtRON Biotechnology ( Daejon , South Korea ) . SYBR premix Ex Taq was from Takara Bio Inc ( Shiga , Japan ) . The dual - lu - ciferase reporter assay system was from Promega Corporation ( Madison , WI ) . The ELISA kit for hIL - 8 was from R & D Systems ( Minneapolis , MN ) . All other reagents used in this study were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co ( St . Louis , MO ) . Cell culture HMC - 1 cells were cultured in IMDM medium . Jurkat T and Molt - 4 T cells ( T cells ) , Raji B cells ( B cells ) , THP - 1 cells ( monocytes ) , and 293 - T and CHO - K1 cells ( epithelial cells ) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium . J774A . 1 cells ( ma - crophages ) , HT - 29 cells ( epithelial cells ) , COS - 7 cells ( fibro - blasts ) , and RBL - 2H3 cells ( mast cells ) were cultured in DMEM medium . HUVECs were cultured in EBM medium . All culture media used in this study were supplemented with 10 % heat inactivated FBS , 100 units / ml penicillin G , and 100 μ g / ml streptomycin . Recombinant DNA constructs To generate the swiprosin - 1 / pEGFP - C1 construct , the human swiprosin - 1 clone coding for the full - length open reading frame of swiprosin - 1 in the pOTB7 vector was purchased from RZPD German Resource Center ( Berlin , Germany ) . This was used as a template , and a PCR amplification was per - formed using the primers : sense 5 ’ - AAGAATTCTATGGCCAC - GGACGAGCTGGCCACC - 3 ’ containing the EcoRI restriction site and anti - sense 5 ’ - TTTGGATCCCTACTTAAAGGTGGACT - GCAGCTC - 3 ’ containing the Bam HI restriction site . The PCR product was subcloned as a EcoRI / Bam HI fragment into a pEGFP - C1 vector ( Clontech Laboratory , Inc . ) of a neomycin resistant gene , resulting in an in - frame fusion of swiprosin - 1 to the COOH terminus of GFP . The amino acid sequences of a linker polypeptide between EGFP and swiprosin - 1 were SGLRSRAQAS ( 10 aa ) . To generate wild - type swiprosin - 1 in a pcDNA3 vector or in a pHJ - 1 vector ( lentiviral vector ) , swi - prosin - 1 cDNA from the pOTB7 vector was transferred into the pcDNA3 vector by EcoRI / XhoI or the pHJ - 1 vector by Not I restriction digestions and confirmed by automated sequenc - ing .

Ramesh , et al . 276 IMMUNE NETWORK http : / / www . ksimm . or . kr Volume 9 Number 6 December 2009 Establishment of stable cell lines Stable HMC - 1 transfectants were established using the Nu - cleofector device and corresponding kits ( Amaxa , Cologne , Germany ) by introducing pEGFP - C1 or swiprosin - 1 / pEGFP - C1 cDNA followed by selection with 1 mg / ml geneticin ( Invitrogen ) . The cells were then subjected to a FACS and sorted to selectively obtain GFP - positive cells . They were then cultured in complete medium supplemented with the same concentrations of antibiotics . The stable cells that ex - pressed EGFP or EGFP fused with swiprosin - 1 were des - ignated as H - GFP cells and H - swip - 1 _ GFP cells , respectively . RNA isolation and RT - PCR Cells from the tissue samples or in vitro cultures were har - vested and total RNA was isolated using the WelPrep TM JBI method ( iNtRON Biotechnology , Daejon , Korea ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Reverse transcription of the RNA was performed using oligo dT primer Maxime RT - PCR PreMix ( iNtRON Biotechnology , Daejon , Korea ) . Two micro - grams of RNA was transferred to an oligo dT primer mixture tube . The reaction volume was 20 μ l . cDNA synthesis was performed at 45 o C for 60 min , followed by RT inactivation at 95 o C for 5 min . Thereafter , the RT - generated DNA was di - luted to 40 μ l volume with distilled water . The diluted RT - generated DNA ( 2 μ l ) was amplified using Maxime PCR PreMix ( iNtRON Biotechnology , Daejon , Korea ) . The primers used for cDNA amplification were as follows : hSwip - 1 ( p1 ) , sense 5 ’ - ATCTTCCGCAAGGCGGCGGCCGGGGAG - 3 ’ and an - tisense 5 ’ - GACTGCAGCTCCTTGAAGGCCGCTTTC - 3 ’ ; hSwip - 1 ( p2 ) , sense 5 ’ - CTCGAGGCCACAGTTATGCAA - 3 ’ and anti - sense 5 - ’ TAAGGCAAACGCA - 3 ’ ; rSwip - 1 ( p1 ) , Sense 5 ’ - CGTT - ATGCAATGTTCCTCGTGTCACTG - 3 ’ and antisense 5 ’ - GATT - CTCACAGGTTCTAAGACCGAAAA - 3 ’ ; rSwip - 1 ( p2 ) , Sense 5 ’ - TACAATGCCTCAAGAGCCCCCGGGACC - 3 ’ and antisense 5 ’ - CCAAAAGTAAAGGGAATTTATATTCCT - 3 ’ ; mSwip - 1 , sense 5 ’ - GAGGCTCCCGACGAGACTGCCCAGGCG - 3 ’ and antisense 5 ’ - CCGGAAGCTGAGTTTGCTGTCGAAATC - 3 ’ ; hIL - 3 , sense 5 ’ - CTTTGCCTTTGCTGGACTTC - 3 ’ and antisense 5 ’ - CGAGG - CTCAAAGTCGTCTG - 3 ’ ; hIL - 8 , sense 5 ’ - GTGCAGTTTTGCC - AAGGAGT - 3 ’ and antisense 5 ’ - CTCTGCACCCAGTTTTCCTT - 3 ’ ; hTNF - α , sense 5 ’ - GGCTCCAGGCGGTGCTTGTTC - 3 ’ and an - tisense 5 ’ - AGACGGCGATGCGGCTGATG - 3 ’ ; hGAPDH , sense 5 ’ - CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT - 3 ’ and antisense 5 ’ - AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC - 3 ’ ; r β - actin , sense 5 ’ - ATTGAACACGGCATTGTCAC - 3 ’ and antisense 5 ’ - GTCTCAAA - CATGATCTGGGTC - 3 ’ . Amplification conditions were denatu - ration at 94 o C for 30 s , annealing at 58 ∼ 68 o C for 20 s , and extension at 72 o C for 40 s for 30 ∼ 35 cycles . The PCR prod - ucts were resolved and visualized on a 1 or 1 . 5 % agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide . Real - time quantitative RT - PCR In all the experiments , the expression levels of the examined genes were evaluated by real - time RT - PCR , unless otherwise indicated . PCR amplification was performed in DNA Engine Opticon for a continuous fluorescence detection system ( MJ Research , Waltham , MA ) in a total volume of 20 μ l containing 2 μ l of cDNA / control and gene specific primers using the SYBR premix Ex Taq kit ( Takara , Shiga , Japan ) . The PCR was performed under the following conditions : 94 o C for 30 s , 58 ∼ 68 o C for 30 s , 72 o C for 30 s , plate read ( detection of fluo - rescent product ) for 40 cycles , followed by 7 min of extension at 72 o C . A melting curve analysis was done to characterize the dsDNA product by slowly raising the temperature ( 0 . 2 o C / s ) from 65 o C to 95 o C with fluorescence data collected at 0 . 2 o C intervals . The levels of expression ( of swiprosin - 1 , IL - 3 , IL - 8 , and TNF - α ) that were normalized by GAPDH or β - actin were expressed as a relative value ( i . e . , percentage ) of the maximum . The result of the maximum level in each experiment was considered as 100 % . Immunofluorescence staining and confocal imaging analysis Stable HMC - 1 cells ( H - GFP or H - swip - 1 _ GFP ; 1×10 5 ) or COS - 7 cells ( transfected with GFP or swip - 1 _ GFP ) were seed - ed onto the poly - L - lysine ( PLL ) - coated or uncoated 18 - mm glass coverslips . The cells were then fixed with 3 . 7 % form - aldehyde for 10 min and washed twice with 1X PBS . F - actin was detected by staining with phalloidin - TRITC ( 50 μ g / ml ) . 293 - T cells ( swiprosin - 1 transfectants ) were also grown on glass coverslips . The cells were fixed as described above , then incubated with primary goat polyclonal swiprosin - 1 anti - body , followed by secondary FITC - conjugated anti - goat an - tibody . The localization of swiprosin - 1 and actin was exam - ined with an FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope ( Olympus Corporation , Japan ) equipped with 40× , 63× , and 100× objectives . In some cases , cells were not fixed and live images were obtained by confocal microscopy . For the co - lo - calization analysis , the Z section cutting area through the ap - ical surface was chosen . The overlapping degree of intensity ( ODI ) was calculated by FLUOVIEW software version 1 . 5 . Swiprosin - 1 Regulates HMC - 1 Cytokine Expression T . P .

( A ) Expression of swiprosin - 1 mRNA in various cell types . RNAs were prepared from cell lines including Jurkat T and Molt - 4 T ( T cells ) , Raji B ( B cells ) , THP - 1 ( monocytes ) , 293T , CHO - K1 , HT - 29 ( epithelial cells ) , and rat RBL - 2H3 ( mast cells ) , and then the mRNA levels of swiprosin - 1 were determined by RT - PCR . Note : Expression of swiprosin - 1 in RBL - 2H3 was determined by using rat swiprosin - 1 - specific primers . ( B ) Induction of swiprosin - 1 in HMC - 1 cells by PMA / A23187 . HMC - 1 cells were treated with PMA ( 200 nM ) and A23187 ( 1 μ M ) . At the indicated time points , the expression of swiprosin - 1 was determined by RT - PCR . ( C ) Induction of swiprosin - 1 in RBL - 2H3 cells by cross - linking of Fc ε RI . RBL - 2H3 cells were sensitized with anti - DNP - IgE ( 1 μ g / ml ) for 18 h , and then the cells were challenged with DNP - HSA ( 1 μ g / ml ) . At the indicated time points , the expression of swiprosin - 1 was determined by RT - PCR . The information of primers ( P1 and P2 ) was described in the Materials and Methods . Amplification of GAPDH and hTNF - α were used as an internal control and an activated mast cell marker , respectively . All data are from at least three separate experiments . The co - localization percentage was then derived from the ODI , multiplying by 100 . For live - cell time - lapse confocal imaging , H - swip - 1 _ GFP cells were seeded at 2×10 5 on 18 - mm glass coverslips mount - ed in a chamber device . Cells were allowed to settle for 10 min at 37 o C and then activated by adding PMA / A23187 . During the live - cell imaging , the chamber devices were main - tained at 37 o C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere , using a live - cell in - strument system ( Chanlide Ⓡ Inc . , Korea ) . A confocal series of fluorescence and differential interference contrast ( DIC ) images were simultaneously obtained at 20 - s intervals using an 100× oil immersion objective on FV1000 confocal micro - scope ( Olympus ) . The images were processed and assembled into movies using Olympus FLUOVIEW software version 1 . 5 . Cell extract preparation and Western blot analysis For the analysis of swiprosin - 1 , GFP , p - PI3K , and p - Akt HMC - 1 cells ( parent or transfected cells ) were rinsed twice with ice - cold PBS and then lysed in ice - cold lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , containing 50 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , and a protease inhibitor cocktail tablet ) . Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14 , 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 o C and equal amounts of protein supernatant were mixed with a one - fourth volume of 4X SDS sample buffer , boiled for 5 min , and then separated through an 8 or 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate - poly - acrylamide gel . After electrophoresis , proteins were trans - ferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by means of the Trans - Blot SD semidry transfer cell ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) . The membrane was blocked in 5 % skim milk ( 1 h ) , rinsed , and incubated overnight at 4 o C with primary antibodies in TBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ( TBS - T ) and 3 % skim milk . Excess primary Ab was then removed by washing the mem - brane three times in TBS - T , and the membrane was incubated with 0 . 1 μ g / ml horseradish peroxidase - labeled secondary Ab ( against goat , rabbit , or mouse ) for 2 h . Following three washes in TBS - T , bands were visualized by ECL western blot - ting detection reagents and exposed to x - ray film . IL - 8 measurement and histamine release assay Stable HMC - 1 cells ( H - GFP or H - swip - 1 _ GFP ; 2×10 6 ) were seeded into 12 - well plates . The cells were further stimulated with PMA ( 200 nM ) / A23187 ( 1 μ M ) . At the indicated time points , supernatants were collected and IL - 8 and histamine levels were measured by ELISA ( R & D Systems ) , according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Statistical analysis The mean values were calculated from data taken from at least three ( usually four or more ) separate experiments con - ducted on separate days . Where significance testing was per - formed , an independent t test ( Student ’ s ; two populations ) was used . A p value of less than 0 . 05 was considered an indicator of statistical significance . Swiprosin - 1 Regulates HMC - 1 Cytokine Expression T . P . Ramesh , et al . 278 IMMUNE NETWORK http : / / www . ksimm . or . kr Volume 9 Number 6 December 2009 RESULTS Swiprosin - 1 is expressed in mast cells and up - re - gulated during mast cell activation We examined the expression of swiprosin - 1 in various cell types and found that it is expressed in most immune cells , including T and B cells , monocytes , and mast cells . It is also expressed in some non - immune cells , such as epithelial and endothelial cells , though there are some degrees of difference in terms of expression level ( Fig . 1A ) . These results suggest that swiprosin - 1 is not restricted to T and B cells but preva - lently expressed in most cell types , including mast cells . With the semi - quantitative RT - PCR and real - time quantitative PCR , we confirmed that swiprosin - 1 is significantly over - induced in HMC - 1 cells when stimulated with PMA ( 100 nM ) / A23187 ( 1 μ M ) ( Fig . 1B ) . Swiprosin - 1 was also over - induced in the rat mast cell line RBL - 2H3 through the Fc ε RI cross - linking , by treatment with IgE and DNP - HSA , while the induction kinetics was faster than that of HMC - 1 cells ( 2 to 6 h after stimulation ) ( Fig . 1C ) . Swiprosin - 1 enhances mast cell activation by phor - bol ester and calcium ionophore Induction of swiprosin - 1 during mast cell activation , coupled with the fact that swiprosin - 1 has a potential for a novel sig - naling adaptor protein ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 13 ) , suggests that swiprosin - 1 may be involved in mast cell activation as a signal adaptor molecule . To verify this , we generated HMC - 1 cells that tran - siently or stably over - express either GFP ( H - GFP cells ) alone or GFP fused to swiprosin - 1 ( H - swip - 1 _ GFP cells ) ( data not shown ) . As shown in Fig . 2A ∼ C , over - expression of swipro - sin - 1 significantly enhanced PMA / A23187 - induced cytokine expression . This result was consistent with the previous re - sults ( 3 ) . In addition , it enhanced histamine release by PMA / A23187 stimulation ( Fig . 2D ) . We next tested whether silencing swiprosin - 1 can alter the cytokine expression in HMC - 1 cells . To this end , we trans - fected HMC - 1 cells with siRNA targeting swiprosin - 1 , and then evaluated the cells for cytokine expression . However , knock - down of swiprosin - 1 only showed a modest effect on PMA / A23187 - induced IL - 3 and IL - 8 mRNA expression in HMC - 1 cells ( data not shown ) , suggesting that swiprosin - 1 has gain - of - function characteristics . Cytochalasin B , an actin depolymerizing agent , and wortmannin , a PI3K inhibitor , selectively inhibit cyto - kine expression in swiprosin - 1 expressing HMC - 1 cells The modest effect of swiprosin - 1 knock - down on cytokine expression by PMA / A23187 may suggest that swiprosin - 1 is not involved in the main pathway of cytokine expression but has an additive effect if over - expressed , presumably by mod - ulating another pathway . We therefore employed various pharmacologic agents to systemically control the intracellular signaling pathways potentially involved in mast cell acti - vation . First , both NF - κ B and NF - AT pathways are critical for IgE - mediated cytokine production ( 14 , 15 ) . We examined the effects of two pharmacologic agents , MG132 and cyclosporine A , on PMA / A23187 - induced cytokine expression in both H - GFP cells and H - swip - 1 _ GFP cells . As shown in Fig . 3A ( left ) , both of these agents significantly suppressed cytokine expression in both cells to almost the same degree . Second , MAPK signaling pathways are also involved in cytokine ex - pression in mast cells ( 16 - 18 ) . Thus , the effects of two phar - macologic inhibitors of ERK and p38 kinase , PD98059 ( 10 μ M ) and SB203580 ( 10 μ M ) , respectively , were examined . As shown in Fig . 3A ( right ) , both of the inhibitors significantly inhibited PMA / A23187 - induced cytokine expression in both cells . Taken together , the above results suggest that swipro - sin - 1 lies at least upstream or at the site of two main signaling pathways in terms of cytokine expression in HMC - 1 cells . Third , both Src family kinases and PI3K are central players in mast cell degranulation mediated by the cross - linking of Fc ε R1 ( 7 ) , but are not well understood in cytokine ex - pression of HMC - 1 cells mediated by phorbol ester and cal - cium ionophores . We therefore tested whether enhanced cy - tokine expression in H - swip - 1 _ GFP is also related to these kinases . As shown in Fig . 3B ( left ) , PP2 , a Src kinase in - hibitor , significantly inhibited cytokine expression in both H - GFP and H - swip - 1 _ GFP cells , suggesting a requirement of Src family kinases in PMA / A23187 - induced cytokine ex - pression in HMC - 1 cells . Interestingly , however , wortmannin , a PI3K inhibitor , only inhibited cytokine expression in H - swip - 1 _ GFP cells ( Fig . 3B , left ) . This result suggests that swi - prosin - 1 may influence cytokine expression in HMC - 1 cells thorough activation of the PI3K pathway while the PI3K is not mainly involved in PMA / A23187 - induced cytokine ex - pression . Notably , we found that treatment with HMC - 1 cells with PMA / A23187 resulted in no significant effect on the Swiprosin - 1 Regulates HMC - 1 Cytokine Expression T . P .

In contrast , both p - PI3K and p - Akt were observed in H - swip - 1 _ GFP cells even before treatment ( 0 min ) ( Fig . Swiprosin - 1 Regulates HMC - 1 Cytokine Expression T . P . Ramesh , et al . 280 IMMUNE NETWORK http : / / www . ksimm . or . kr Volume 9 Number 6 December 2009 Figure 3 . Inhibition of cytokine expression by various pharmacologic agents in HMC - 1 cells expressing GFP or swip - 1 _ GFP . ( A , B ) H - GFP or H - swip - 1 _ GFP cells were pretreated for 30 min with or without various pharmacologic inhibitors including MG132 ( 1 μ M ) , cyclosporine A ( CSA , 1 μ g / ml ) , PD98059 ( PD , 10 μ M ) , SB203580 ( SB , 10 μ M ) , wortmannin ( WOT , 100 nM ) , PP2 ( 10 μ M ) , colchicines ( Col , 20 μ M ) , and cytochalasin B ( CTB , 1 μ g / ml ) . Then the cells were further stimulated for 4 h with or without PMA ( 200 nM ) / A23187 ( 1 μ M ) . The expression of cytokines was determined by RT - PCR ( top ) and quantitative RT - PCR ( bottom ) . Amplification of GAPDH was used as an internal control . Data represent three separate experiments . The data shown in the bar graphs represent mean±SD values of triplicate experiments . 4 ) . Fourth , PI3K also has an important regulatory function for receptor - mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements in mast cells ( 19 , 20 ) . We therefore evaluated the potential involvement of two of the most important components of the cytoskeleton , actin and microtubule . It has been reported that disruption of actin microfilaments by cytochalasin B enhanced the de - granulation response in RBL - 2H mast cells ( 21 , 22 ) . In con - trast , microtubule disruption is known to suppress the de - granulation response through inhibition of calcium influx in the same cells ( 23 ) . As shown in Fig . 3B ( right ) , microtubule depolymerizer colchicine significantly suppressed cytokine expression in both H - GFP and H - swip - 1 _ GFP cells , suggest - ing that microtubules are also important in PMA / A23187 - in - duced cytokine expression in HMC - 1 cells . However , actin depolymerizer cytochalasin B inhibited cytokine expression that was produced only in H - swip - 1 _ GFP cells ( Fig . 3B , right ) . These results demonstrate that actin polymerization is not normally involved in cytokine expression of HMC - 1 cells stimulated by PMA / A23187 . However , the present results strongly imply that swiprosin - 1 may act through regulation of PI3K and actin regulation . Swiprosin - 1 localized in actin - rich microvilli - like re - gion in mast cells In many cases , localization of proteins in specialized sites within cells reflects their specific functions . Moreover , re - duced cytokine expression in H - swip - 1 _ GFP cells by actin de - polymerizer cytochalasin B suggests a specific role of swipro - sin - 1 in association with the actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 3B , right ) . We therefore examined localization of swiprosin - 1 in HMC - 1 cells and other cell types using confocal microscopy . As shown in Fig . 5A , swip - 1 _ GFP was highly localized in mi - crovilli - like protrusions of HMC - 1 cells , while GFP was dis - tributed through the entire cytosol and nucleus . To better un - derstand this contrast , wild - type swiprosin - 1 ( without GFP ) was also transfected in 293T cells and stained with antibody against swiprosin - 1 followed by FITC - conjugated secondary Swiprosin - 1 Regulates HMC - 1 Cytokine Expression T .

Ectopic expression of swiprosin - 1 increases phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt in HMC - 1 cells . H - GFP or H - swip - 1 _ GFP cells were treated with PMA ( 200 nM ) / A23187 ( 1 μ M ) . At the indicated time points , the cells were lysed and p - PI3K and p - Akt were determined by western blot . antibody . We then evaluated the localization by high reso - lution confocal microscopy . Interestingly , swiprosin - 1 was no - tably accumulated in the membrane apical ridge area of 293T cells ( Fig . 5B ) . This observation may agree with the report that swiprosin - 1 is a lipid raft protein in B cells ( 4 ) . Since F - actin is known to be enriched in the microvilli - like region ( 24 ) , we tested whether swiprosin - 1 is localized with F - actin in both HMC - 1 and COS - 7 cells . As shown in Fig . 5C and D , swiprosin - 1 was highly co - localized with F - actin in both HMC - 1 and COS - 7 cells , and re - localized along with the movement of F - actin in COS - 7 cells , when the cells were stimulated with PMA ( Fig . 5D ) . Collectively , localization of swiprosin - 1 in the microvilli - like region ( Fig . 5A ) or mem - brane ridge region ( Fig . 5B ) and its association with F - actin ( Fig . 5C , D ) , together with the fact that the actin - disrupting agent cytochalasin B inhibits cytokine expression only in H - swip - 1 _ GFP cells , suggest that swiprosin - 1 functions through actin regulation and reorganization . DISCUSSION Molecules produced by mast cells also can activate mast cells in an autocrine manner . For example , TNF - α is one of the major cytokines that autocrinely activates HMC - 1 cells ( 25 ) . In a similar manner , ectopic expression of swiprosin - 1 aug - mented PMA / A23187 - induced NF - κ B promoter activity as well as cytokine expression ( 3 ) . In the present report , we demonstrate that localization of swiprosin - 1 in microvilli - like membrane protrusion with F - actin may be important in acti - Swiprosin - 1 Regulates HMC - 1 Cytokine Expression T .

In the previous study , we unambiguously demonstrated that swiprosin - 1 expression is transcriptionally regulated both in vitro in a model of phorbol ester - induced activation and Swiprosin - 1 Regulates HMC - 1 Cytokine Expression T . P . Ramesh , et al . 283 IMMUNE NETWORK http : / / www . ksimm . or . kr Volume 9 Number 6 December 2009 in vivo in pathological models . The results strongly suggested that swiprosin - 1 may be importantly involved in physiological and / or pathological processes . Furthermore , increased ex - pression of swiprosin - 1 in tissue models of PCA and atopic dermatitis suggested a potential role for swiprosin - 1 in in - flammatory responses ( 3 ) . With this respect , the current re - sults strongly demonstrate that swiprosin - 1 is involved in the inflammatory responses by expressing and releasing cy - tokines . Localization of proteins in specialized sites in the cells can reflect their specific functions ( 26 - 28 ) . For example , SLP - 76 , an adaptor protein that is critical for Fc ε RI - induced calcium flux , degranulation , and cytokine secretion in mast cells , is found in the cytosol of unstimulated cells . Upon Fc ε RI cross - linking , SLP - 76 translocates to the cell membrane , form - ing clusters that co - localize with the Fc ε RI , the tyrosine kin - ase Syk , the adaptor LAT , and phosphotyrosine . Disruption of this localization has been reported to inhibit Fc ε RI - medi - ated signaling in mast cells ( 27 ) . In accordance with this , the present finding that the highest concentration of swiprosin - 1 in the microvilli - like membrane structure implies that this pro - tein may function by forming signaling complexes in the plas - ma membrane or by associating with actin or actin regulatory molecules . Moreover , reduction of actin contents by over - ex - pression of swiprosin - 1 further supports its potential role in actin reorganization . Indeed , the proline - rich element in the predicted secondary structure of swiprosin - 1 is known as a potential binding site for the SH3 domain ( 2 ) , the best - charac - terized member of the growing family of protein - interaction modules involved in signaling to the dynamic actin networks ( 29 , 30 ) . In accordance with the predicted secondary structure , our unpublished results revealed that deletion of the pro - line - rich element in swiprosin - 1 significantly reduced its asso - ciation with F - actin in COS - 7 cells ( data not shown ) . Based on the evidence regarding the physical or functional association of swiprosin - 1 with actin in the current study , it is not surprising that disruption of actin polymerization by cy - tochalasin B effectively inhibits cytokine expression in HMC - 1 cells . Induction of p - PI3K and p - Akt and inhibition of cyto - kine expression by wortmannin also implies that swiprosin - 1 affects the PI3K pathway coupled with the regulation of actin dynamics . However , the fact that targeted knockdown of swi - prosin - 1 showed a modest effect on cytokine expression may suggest that swiprosin - 1 is not involved in the main pathways of cytokine expression but has an additive effect if over - in - duced , presumably activating actin reorganization in mast cells . We are now undertaking a study to identify the poten - tial phosphorylation sites of swiprosin - 1 and their implications in swiprosin - 1 - mediated activation of mast cells . In addition , we are planning to identify potential binding partners of swi - prosin - 1 to understand the mechanisms whether or how swi - prosin - 1 interacts with actin and regulates mast cell activation . One intriguing result in this study is that swiprosin - 1 is rapidly ( ＜ 5 min ) and dramatically redistributed to the secreting gran - ules of HMC - 1 cells during activation by PMA / A23187 ( data not shown ) . The result implies that swiprosin - 1 may also be involved in the process of mast cell degranulation by cou - pling with actin dynamics . The mast cell is a central player in allergy and asthma . Activation of these cells induces the release of preformed in - flammatory mediators localized in specialized granules and the de novo synthesis and secretion of cytokines , chemo - kines , and eicosanoids ( 7 ) . Upon stimulation , mast cell re - sponse can be regulated by the balance of both positive and negative intracellular molecular events ( 7 ) . Here , we suggest that swiprosin - 1 is a novel regulator for the positive feedback activation of mast cells . Once induced , this protein is highly localized in the actin - rich microvilli - like membrane pro - trusions in mast cells . In pathological situations , this protein may regulate local allergic or inflammatory responses by am - plifying signals that are required for mast cell activation .
