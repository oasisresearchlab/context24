Hence , endocytosis plays a key role in the processing of APP and subsequent Aβ generation . β - ,  - secretases as well as APP are localized in cholesterol - enriched lipid raft microdomains . However , it is still unclear whether lipid rafts are the site where APP undergoes endocytosis and whether cholesterol levels affect this process . In this study , we found that localization of APP in lipid rafts was increased by elevated cholesterol level . We also showed that increasing or decreasing cholesterol levels increased or decreased APP endocytosis , respectively . When we labeled cell surface APP , APP localized in lipid rafts preferentially underwent endocytosis compared to non - raft localized APP . In addition , APP endocytosis from lipid rafts was regulated by cholesterol levels . Our results indicate that cholesterol levels regulate the localization of APP in lipid rafts affecting raft - dependent APP endocytosis . Thus , regulating the microdomain localization of APP could offer a new therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer’s disease . Keywords : Alzheimer’s disease / amyloid precursor protein / cholesterol / lipid raft / endocytosis 3 Introduction Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disease which is the most prevalent form of dementia ( Probst et al . , 1991 ) . The hallmarks of AD pathogenesis are the extracellular deposition of senile plaques and the presence of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles , which lead to severe neuronal atrophy and ultimately death . Elevated levels of , and accumulation of cerebral β - amyloid ( Aβ ) peptides is the dominant pathological factor in the formation of senile plaques . Aβ is a by - product of the sequential proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) by membrane bound β - , γ - secretases ( Bergmans & De Strooper , 2010 , Shoji et al . , 1992 , Vassar et al . , 1999 ) . APP at the plasma membrane is internalized via endocytosis and delivered to early endosomes and lysosomes , where Aβ is produced . Therefore , APP is more likely to become accessible to β - , γ - secretases when the rate of APP endocytosis is increased , resulting in elevated production of Aβ ( Gandy , 2005 , Tanzi & Bertram , 2005 ) . Hence , the regulation of endocytic pathways plays a key role in the trafficking and processing of APP and subsequent Aβ generation . Cholesterol is an essential component of the plasma membrane and has number of physiological functions , among which is the regulation of endocytosis and exocytosis ( Doherty & McMahon , 2009 , El - Sayed & Harashima , 2013 , Yue & Xu , 2015 ) . As a result , cholesterol has been extensively implicated in the regulation of cellular APP processing , contributing to the development of AD ( Burns & Rebeck , 2010 , Chun et al . , 2013 , Grimm et al . , 2017 , Maulik et al . , 2013 , Posse de Chaves E , 2012 , Urano et al . , 2013 , Walter & van Echten - Deckert , 2013 ) . Furthermore , lipid dyshomeostasis , including elevated cholesterol levels , is a key participant in the pathogenesis of AD ( Chun & Chung , 2020 , Di Paolo & Kim , 2011 , Fabelo et al . , 2014 , Heverin et al . , 2004 , Jarvik et al . , 1995 , Schneider et al . , 2006 , van Echten - Deckert & Walter , 2012 , Vanmierlo et al . , 2010 , Xiong et al . , 2008 ) . Lipid raft microdomains , enriched with cholesterol and sphingolipids , are considered as cellular processing platforms for various cell signaling and protein - protein interactions ( Brown & London , 1998 , Brown & London , 2000 , Pike , 2006 , Sezgin et al . , 2017 ) . Substantial evidence supports the importance of lipid raft microdomains in APP processing and Aβ production . With the antibody cross - linking method , it is reported that APP and β - secretase are co - patched in lipid raft 4 microdomains , and that Aβ production increases as cholesterol levels increase ( Ehehalt et al . , 2003 ) . According to FRET experiments , clustering of APP and β - secretase in lipid raft microdomains occurs both on plasma membranes and in intracellular compartments and is triggered by exposure to cholesterol in primary neurons ( Marquer et al . , 2011 ) . In addition , it is widely believed that β - and  - secretases as well as their substrate APP are localized in lipid raft microdomains ( Benjannet et al . , 2001 , Bhattacharyya et al . , 2013 , Hur et al . , 2008 , Osenkowski et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , recent studies demonstrated that the enlarged lipid raft domains resulting from increased cholesterol levels enhances APP’s access to its processing enzymes , β - and γ - secretases ( Cordy et al . , 2003 , Ehehalt et al . , 2003 , Marquer et al . , 2011 , Marquer et al . , 2014 , Vetrivel & Thinakaran , 2010 ) . In accordance with these reports , a recent study reported that increased plasma membrane cholesterol induces clathrin - dependent APP endocytosis and increases Aβ generation in cultured cells ( Cossec et al . , 2010 ) . Since cholesterol is the main component of lipid rafts and membrane trafficking plays a critical role in APP processing , it is important to understand the precise role of cholesterol - enriched lipid raft microdomains in APP processing and Aβ generation . In our previous study , CHO PS1 ΔE9 cells showed elevated cellular cholesterol levels that were accompanied by the increased APP localization in lipid raft microdomains ( Cho et al . , 2019 ) . Modulating cellular cholesterol levels using methyl - beta - cyclodextrin ( MβCD ) , tebuconazole , or MβCD - cholesterol redistributed APP between lipid rafts and non - rafts . These results may suggest that impaired cholesterol homeostasis is directly associated with the increased recruitment of APP into lipid raft microdomains , which then subsequently contributes to increases in Aβ production . However , it is unclear whether the increased APP localization in lipid raft microdomains is directly related to the increased Aβ production . More importantly , it is still unknown whether lipid rafts are sites where APP undergoes endocytosis . In the present study , we found that enhanced cellular cholesterol level increase the localization of surface APP in lipid raft microdomains . Moreover , cholesterol level also regulated the rate of APP endocytosis . By labeling APP at the cell surface , we showed that APP localized in lipid rafts preferentially underwent endocytosis compared to APP in non - rafts , and that APP endocytosis from lipid rafts was regulated by cholesterol levels . The APP internalized from lipid rafts primarily 5 accumulated in early endosomes . Furthermore , endogenous APP in hippocampal neurons was shown to relocate between lipid rafts and non - rafts depending on cholesterol levels . Thus , our findings provide compelling evidence for the involvement of cholesterol - enriched lipid raft microdomains in APP endocytosis and Aβ production . Results 1 . Cholesterol levels regulate the localization of cell surface APP in lipid raft microdomains . We previously showed that cellular cholesterol level in CHO PS1 ΔE9 cells is up - regulated compared to PS1 WT cells , and that the elevated cholesterol increases APP localization in lipid rafts ( Cho et al . , 2019 ) . To confirm these results , we co - immunostained surface APP with lipid raft marker , caveolin . CHO PS1 WT and PS1 ΔE9 cells were incubated with APP antibody ( 6E10 ) against the N - terminal region of APP at 4°C to label APP at the plasma membrane . After fixation , cells were permeabilized and incubated with caveolin - 1 antibody . Typical immunoreactivity of APP and caveolin ( cav ) are shown in Fig 1A . Co - localization of APP and caveolin was quantified as shown in Fig 1B - D . The coefficient was significantly higher in PS1 ΔE9 cells compared to PS1 WT cells by 2 . 6 - fold , indicating increased localization of APP in lipid rafts ( Fig 1B , n = 4 ) . We manipulated membrane cholesterol levels with MβCD - cholesterol or MβCD to increase or decrease cellular cholesterol levels , respectively . Total cholesterol levels were measured and compared under different conditions ( Appendix Figure S1 ) . Firstly , PS1 WT cells were treated with 150 μM MβCD - cholesterol for 1 h . Cholesterol levels increased by 2 . 2 - fold with this manipulation while APP localization in caveolin - positive lipid rafts was increased by 3 - fold ( Fig 1C , n = 4 ) . Secondly , PS1 ΔE9 cells were treated with 5 mM MβCD for 30 min . In this condition , we observed an approximately 27 % reduction of cholesterol levels and simultaneously a significant decrease of APP localization in caveolin - positive lipid rafts ( Fig 1D , n = 4 ) . Cholera toxin B ( CTB ) binds to ganglioside GM1 , one of the components of the cholesterol - 6 enriched lipid raft microdomains ( Chinnapen et al . , 2007 ) . When we used CTB as another marker for lipid rafts , the manipulation of cholesterol levels showed similar APP localization results ( Fig EV1 ) . Taken together , these data suggested that increasing membrane cholesterol level increased APP localization in lipid rafts , while decreasing cholesterol level had the opposite effect . 2 . Endocytosis rate of APP is increased in CHO PS1 ΔE9 cells . It is widely accepted that cellular cholesterol affects membrane trafficking , particularly through endosomal / lysosomal pathways ( Doherty & McMahon , 2009 , Yue & Xu , 2015 ) . Consistent with these reports , several studies have demonstrated that cholesterol - enriched lipid raft microdomains are associated with endocytosis of membrane anchored proteins ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 , Kirkham & Parton , 2005a , Kirkham & Parton , 2005b , Okamoto et al . , 2000 ) . Abnormal enlargement of endosomal compartments has been observed prior to the deposition of Aβ peptides in sporadic AD ( Cataldo et al . , 2004 ) . Furthermore , elevated plasma membrane cholesterol increased clathrin - dependent APP endocytosis , subsequently increasing Aβ generation ( Cossec et al . , 2010 ) . Since we observed that increased cholesterol levels increased the localization of APP in lipid rafts , we tested whether APP endocytosis was also affected . For this purpose , we used the primary antibody uptake method . Two different fluorescence - conjugated secondary antibodies were used to differentiate internalized APP from APP in the plasma membrane . Cells were incubated with APP antibody at 4°C to label cell surface APP . After labeling , unbound antibodies were washed and cells were incubated at 37°C for 5 , 10 , and 30 min to allow internalization of antibody - bound APP . Subsequently , cells were fixed and incubated with Alexa647 - conjugated secondary antibody at 4°C to visualize only the APP remaining at the plasma membrane . After permeabilizing , internalized APP was captured by Alexa488 - conjugated secondary antibody . Typical immunofluorescence reactivities for surface APP ( S - APP ; red ) and internalized APP ( In - APP ; green ) were visualized under confocal microscopy as shown in Fig 2A . APP was exclusively localized at the plasma membrane at 0 min in both PS1 WT and PS1 ΔE9 cells . In PS1 WT cells , internalized APP gradually increased during the time course of incubation . A significant amount of APP remained 7 at the plasma membrane even at 10 min . In PS1 ΔE9 cells , however , a significant amount of APP was internalized even at 5 min while cell surface APP was rapidly reduced . Rates of APP endocytosis were measured by calculating the intensity ratio of internalized APP ( green ) over surface APP ( red ) as shown in Fig 2B . The intensity ratio of APP at 5 min was much larger in PS1 ΔE9 cells ( 5 . 0 ± 0 . 3 , n = 5 ) than in PS1 WT cells ( 1 . 2 ± 0 . 1 , n = 5 ) , indicating increased APP endocytosis . In an alternative way to quantitatively measure the rate of endocytosis , biotinylation method was used . Cells were incubated with sulfo - NHS - SS - biotin to label all surface proteins at 4°C ( Ehlers , 2000 , Kittler et al . , 2004 ) . After washing , cells were incubated at 37°C for 0 , 5 , 10 , and 30 min to allow internalization of biotin - labeled surface proteins . After initiating endocytosis , reducing agent was used to remove biotins from surface proteins . Following cell lysis , the internalized biotin - bound proteins were captured using streptavidin beads . The biotin - labeled proteins were loaded on SDS - PAGE gels and examined with APP antibody . Thus , the biotin - bound APP represented the internalized APP during the incubation times at 37°C . We also labeled surface proteins with biotin and examined APP levels using Western blots to measure levels of total surface APP ( surface APP ) . Representative Western blot image is shown in Fig 2C . The relative level of internalized APP was evaluated by comparing the amounts of biotin - labeled internalized APP to total surface APP ( Fig 2C ) . At 5 min , 35 . 8 ± 3 . 1 % of surface APP was internalized in PS1 WT cells , whereas 67 . 5 ± 1 . 0 % of surface APP was internalized in PS1 ΔE9 cells ( n = 6 ) . The amounts of internalized APP were significantly higher at each time point in CHO PS1 ΔE9 cells than in PS1 WT cells , consistent with our primary antibody uptake results . After 5 min , the amount of internalized APP diminished , which may be due to the rapid cleavage of APP by secretases once it is internalized ( Weidemann et al . , 1989 ) . These results suggest that the endocytosis rate of APP increased in PS1 ΔE9 cells compared to PS1 WT cells . 3 . Increased cholesterol level does not affect the endocytosis rate of transferrin in CHO PS1 ΔE9 cells . A recent study demonstrated that increasing or decreasing cellular cholesterol causes endocytosis rates to increase and decrease , respectively , in the rat calyx of Held terminals ( Yue & Xu , 8 2015 ) . Thus , it is possible that elevating plasma membrane cholesterol may non - specifically increase endocytosis rates of most proteins . It was also reported that cholesterol affected both clathrin - dependent and - independent endocytosis ( McMahon & Boucrot , 2011 , Subtil et al . , 1999 ) . To test whether the cholesterol - mediated effect was specific or non - specific , we measured transferrin endocytosis from CHO PS1 WT and PS1 ΔE9 cells . Transferrin is a well characterized protein which is internalized via clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Doherty & McMahon , 2009 ) . Cells were treated with Alexa488 - conjugated transferrin at 37°C for 5 , 10 , and 30 min to allow its endocytosis . The residual surface transferrin was removed by acidic buffer and the remaining intracellular transferrin was visualized under fluorescent microscopy ( Appendix Figure S2 ) . When fluorescence intensity was analyzed , the endocytosis levels of transferrin were not different between PS1 ΔE9 and PS1 WT cells . We also quantitatively measured transferrin endocytosis rate using a biochemical method . Cells were incubated with Alexa488 - conjugated transferrin at 37°C for 5 , 10 , and 30 min to allow its internalization . Then , the cell lysates were run on Western blotting . The fluorescent bands were detected and quantified . The endocytosis rate of transferrin in PS1 ΔE9 cells was not different from that in PS1 WT cells ( Appendix Figure S2 ) . These observations suggested that the effect of increased cholesterol specifically increased APP endocytosis , but not clathrin - dependent endocytosis generally . 4 . Cholesterol levels regulate endocytosis rates of APP . To investigate whether cholesterol levels affected the rate of APP endocytosis , we pre - treated cells with MβCD or MβCD - cholesterol . Firstly , CHO PS1 ΔE9 cells were treated with 5 mM MβCD for 30 min to reduce cellular cholesterol . Then , cells were incubated with APP antibody and further treated with two different fluorescence - conjugated secondary antibodies to visualize internalized APP and APP in the plasma membrane ( Fig 3A ) . In MβCD - treated cells , APP remained at the plasma membrane even after 10 min internalization , which was similar to PS1 WT cells . Rates of APP endocytosis are represented by the ratio of internalized APP ( green ) over surface APP ( red ) ( Fig 3B ) . At 5 min , the intensity ratio decreased from 7 . 0 ± 0 . 7 to 1 . 9 ± 0 . 2 ( n = 5 ) by MβCD , indicating a significant reduction of APP endocytosis . Biotinylation method using sulfo - NHS - SS - biotin was also 9 performed to measure the rate of APP endocytosis . Cells were incubated at 37°C for 0 , 5 , 10 , and 30 min to allow internalization ( Fig 3C ) . Levels of total surface APP ( surface APP ) were also measured . In PS1 ΔE9 control cells , 73 . 2 ± 9 . 7 % ( n = 6 ) of surface APP was internalized at 5 min . In contrast , only 26 . 8 ± 5 . 7 % ( n = 6 ) of surface APP was internalized at 5 min in MβCD - treated cells . These results indicate that decreasing cellular cholesterol levels in PS1 ΔE9 cells decreased APP endocytosis rate . Next , we exogenously elevated cellular cholesterol levels by treating CHO PS1 WT cells with 150 μM MβCD - cholesterol for 1 h . The rate of APP endocytosis was measured with primary antibody uptake method . In PS1 WT control cells , a large amount of surface APP remained at the plasma membrane at 10 min ( Fig EV2 ) . In contrast , surface APP was reduced significantly even at 5 min in MβCD - cholesterol - treated cells . The ratio of APP endocytosis was 1 . 9 ± 0 . 1 ( n = 4 ) and 3 . 4 ± 0 . 2 ( n = 4 ) in PS1 WT control cells at 5 min and 10 min , respectively . MβCD - cholesterol increased the ratio of APP endocytosis to 9 . 2 ± 1 . 4 ( n = 4 ) and 12 . 0 ± 1 . 2 ( n = 4 ) , respectively . Thus , increasing cellular cholesterol levels in PS1 WT cells increased the rate of APP endocytosis . Taken together , these results suggested that cholesterol levels regulate APP endocytosis . 5 . APP localization in lipid rafts is regulated by cholesterol levels . In our previous report , we showed that localization of APP in lipid rafts is increased in CHO PS1 ΔE9 cells compared to PS1 WT cells ( Cho et al . , 2019 ) . We also showed that there is a direct correlation between cellular cholesterol levels and APP localization in lipid raft fractions . To quantitatively measure APP localization in lipid raft microdomains , we designed a biotin - labeled lipid raft fractionation method . Cells were pre - treated with EZ - Link NHS - biotin at 4°C for 10 min to label cell surface proteins . After unbound biotins were washed , cells were harvested , homogenized , and sonicated . Equal amounts of biotin - bound proteins from cell lysates were loaded on discontinuous sucrose density gradients as described in Methods . Equal volumes from 12 recovered gradient fractions were run on Western blot to detect APP , β - actin ( a non - lipid raft marker ) , and caveolin ( a lipid raft marker ) as shown for a typical result in Fig EV3 . When levels of cholesterol and protein were measured , cholesterol - enriched lipid raft fractions ( 4 to 6 ) were clearly separated from protein - 10 enriched non - raft fractions ( 8 to 12 ) . Protein levels in each fraction did not differ between the PS1 WT and PS1 ΔE9 cells . However , cholesterol levels in lipid raft fractions were significantly higher in PS1 ΔE9 cells than in PS1 WT cells as we reported previously ( Cho et al . , 2019 ) . For better quantification of APP levels in lipid raft and non - raft fractions , we combined fractions from 4 to 6 ( lipid raft fractions , R ) , and fractions from 8 to 12 ( non - raft fractions , NR ) . Equal amounts of biotin - bound surface proteins were captured with streptavidin beads . Then , equal volumes of each fraction were loaded on gels for Western blots . Thus , the biotin - bound APP represented cell surface APP localized either in lipid raft or in non - raft fractions . A typical result is shown in Fig 4A and 4C . Higher APP levels in lipid raft fractions compared to non - raft fractions were due to significantly lower total protein levels in lipid raft than in non - raft fractions . Thus , APP comprised a larger proportion of the total proteins in lipid raft fractions . The ratio of surface APP levels in each fraction was calculated as shown in Fig 4B and 4D . APP level in raft fractions was higher in PS1 ΔE9 cells ( 93 . 2 ± 4 . 0 % , n = 5 ) than in PS1 WT cells ( 71 . 6 ± 4 . 6 % , n = 6 ) , which was consistent with our previous co - staining result in Fig 1 . Conversely , surface APP level in non - raft fractions was lower in PS1 ΔE9 cells compared to PS1 WT cells . To investigate the effect of increasing cholesterol levels on surface APP localization in lipid raft fractions , CHO PS1 WT cells were pre - treated with 150 μM MβCD - cholesterol for 1 h ( Fig 4A ) . APP levels in raft fractions were significantly increased to 91 . 3 ± 3 . 3 % ( n = 6 ) by increasing cholesterol levels ( Fig 4B ) . Conversely , surface APP localization in non - raft fractions was significantly decreased by MβCD - cholesterol . Next , CHO PS1 ΔE9 cells were pre - treated with 5 mM MβCD for 30 min to decrease cholesterol levels before labeling surface proteins . In PS1 ΔE9 control cells , most surface APP was localized in lipid raft fractions and barely detectable in non - lipid raft fractions ( Fig 4C ) . Reducing cholesterol level increased the localization of surface APP in non - lipid raft fractions . The ratio of APP in non - lipid raft fractions increased from 6 . 8 ± 4 . 0 % in control cells to 22 . 3 ± 3 . 9 % ( n = 5 ) in cells treated with MβCD ( Fig 4D ) . In contrast , the ratio of APP in lipid raft fractions showed a significant decrease from 93 . 2 ± 4 . 0 % to 77 . 7 ± 3 . 9 % ( n = 5 ) by MβCD treatment . These results indicated that modulating cholesterol levels regulates surface APP localization in lipid 11 rafts , which could affect the further processing of APP and subsequent Aβ42 generation . 6 . APP preferentially internalizes from lipid rafts . Our findings showed that cholesterol levels regulated the localization of surface APP in lipid rafts as well as the rate of APP endocytosis . However , it is still unclear whether lipid raft microdomains are the sites where APP undergoes endocytosis . To investigate this possibility , we applied a reversible biotinylation method to the internalization assay . Cells were pre - treated with EZ - Link NHS - SS - biotin to label surface proteins , and then further incubated at 37°C for 10 min to allow internalization of biotin - labeled surface proteins as described in Methods . All remaining surface biotins were then removed using reducing agents . Equal amount of biotin - bound proteins from cell lysates were loaded on discontinuous sucrose density gradient to obtain 12 fractions . The equal amount of proteins from lipid raft fractions ( R ; fractions 4 to 6 ) , and non - raft fractions ( NR ; fractions 8 to 12 ) were captured with streptavidin beads to pull down biotin - bound proteins . Then , equal volumes of lipid raft and non - lipid raft fractions were loaded for Western blots . If the characteristics of the internalized membranes from lipid raft and non - raft fractions were maintained , the bead - captured APP represented the internalized APP originating from either lipid rafts or non - rafts during the 10 min incubation time . A typical result is shown in Fig 5A and 5C . The ratios of internalized APP from lipid raft and non - raft fractions were calculated and shown in Fig 5B and 5D . The ratio of APP internalized from lipid raft fractions was higher in PS1 ΔE9 cells ( 79 . 3 ± 2 . 1 % , n = 6 ) compared to PS1 WT cells ( 65 . 5 ± 4 . 7 % , n = 5 ) . Considering that surface APP level in raft fractions was higher in PS1 ΔE9 cells than in PS1 WT cells ( Fig 4 ) , this result may suggest that APP is preferentially internalized from lipid rafts . To investigate the effects of cholesterol level on APP internalization from lipid raft fractions , PS1 WT cells were pre - treated with 150 μM MβCD - cholesterol for 1 h . A typical result is shown in Fig 5A , where the ratio of internalized APP from lipid raft fractions was increased to 85 . 4 ± 5 . 1 % ( n = 5 ) by MβCD - cholesterol . In contrast , when we decreased cholesterol levels from PS1 ΔE9 cells , the ratio of internalized APP from raft fractions was decreased to 56 . 7 ± 4 . 9 % ( n = 6 ) . Thus , increasing 12 or decreasing localization of surface APP in lipid rafts consistently induced the same changes in the ratio of internalized APP . These results suggested that cholesterol level affected APP endocytosis from lipid rafts by regulating APP localization in these specific microdomains . To test whether these cholesterol effects on APP endocytosis were cell - type dependent , we used HeLa cells stably transfected with APP751 carrying the Swedish mutation ( APPswe ) . Firstly , cells were incubated with 150 μM MβCD - cholesterol for 1 h . Then , the biotin - labeled lipid raft fractions were obtained to monitor the membrane localization of surface APP . As shown Appendix Figure S3 , increasing cellular cholesterol levels significantly increased the ratio of surface APP in lipid raft microdomains from 77 . 3 ± 3 . 4 % to 90 . 5 ± 2 . 5 % ( n = 5 ) . The effect of cholesterol on lipid raft - dependent APP endocytosis was also tested . The ratio of APP internalized from lipid rafts was increased by elevating cholesterol levels ( Appendix Figure S4 ) , which was consistent with results from CHO PS1 WT cells . Cells were also pre - treated with 1 mM MβCD for 30 min to decrease cholesterol levels before labeling surface proteins using EZ - Link NHS - SS - biotin . Lowering cellular cholesterol levels significantly decreased the ratio of surface APP in lipid rafts from 81 . 9 ± 1 . 9 % to 72 . 2 ± 3 . 0 % and increased the ratio of surface APP in non - lipid rafts from 18 . 1 ± 1 . 9 % to 27 . 8 ± 3 . 0 % ( n = 5 ) ( Appendix Figure S3 ) . Internalized APP from raft fractions was significantly reduced by MβCD ( Appendix Figure S4 ) . From these results , we confirmed that the effects of cholesterol on APP localization in lipid raft fractions as well as on APP endocytosis from lipid rafts were not likely to be cell - type dependent . 7 . Cholesterol increases accumulation of internalized APP in early endosomes . Newly synthesized and matured APP from endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) is transported to plasma membrane ( Thinakaran & Koo , 2008 ) . At the plasma membrane , APP is either cleaved by α - secretase , or undergoes endocytosis through clathrin - dependent and - independent endocytosis within minutes . Since we confirmed that APP endocytosis was sensitive to cellular cholesterol levels , we next determined its subcellular localization . To achieve this , surface APP was labeled with 6E10 antibody in CHO PS1 WT or PS1 ΔE9 cells before internalization . After 13 allowing 5 or 10 min for the internalization of labeled APP at 37°C , cells were fixed and remaining surface APP was captured by anti - mouse secondary antibody to eliminate surface signals . Next , cells were permeabilized , and incubated with EEA1 ( early endosome marker ) antibody for 2 h . After washing , internalized APP and early endosomes were labeled with Alexa647 - , and Alexa488 - conjugated secondary antibodies , respectively . Typical fluorescence reactivities for APP ( red ) and EEA1 ( green ) are shown in Fig 6A . The coefficient of internalized APP and EEA1 was analyzed in Fig 6B . The co - localization of APP and EEA1 was much higher in PS1 ΔE9 cells compared to PS1 WT cells both at 5 min and 10 min ( n = 4 ) , showing the increased APP localization in early endosomes . However , the slopes of coefficient increase from 5 min to 10 min were almost identical in both cells , indicating that the rate of APP trafficking from the plasma membrane to early endosomes was similar in both cells . Thus , our results suggest that only the amount of internalized APP was increased in PS1 ΔE9 cells compared to PS1 WT cells . We also investigated the effects of regulating cholesterol levels on subcellular localization of APP . PS1 WT cells were pre - treated with 150 μM MβCD - cholesterol for 1 h , and internalized APP was monitored . Typical fluorescence reactivities for APP and EEA1 are shown in Fig EV4 . The co - localization of APP and EEA1 is shown in Fig 6B . MβCD - cholesterol significantly increased the amount of APP accumulated in early endosomes by 1 . 4 - fold without change in the slope of coefficient from 5 min to 10 min ( n = 4 ) . In this experiment , APP - EEA1 coefficient looked very similar to that of PS1 ΔE9 cells . We performed the reverse experiment by reducing cholesterol levels . PS1 ΔE9 cells were pre - treated with 5 mM MβCD for 30 min , and internalized APP was monitored . Typical fluorescence reactivities for APP and EEA1 are shown in Fig EV4 . Reducing cholesterol levels significantly decreased the amount of APP accumulated in early endosomes ( Fig 6B ; n = 4 ) . Again , APP - EEA1 coefficient looked very similar to that of PS1 WT cells . These findings indicate that cholesterol levels were closely associated with the amount of internalized APP reaching early endosomes from the plasma membrane . 14 8 . Localization of endogenous neuronal APP in lipid raft microdomains at the plasma membrane is determined by cellular cholesterol levels . To test whether cholesterol levels in neurons affected the partitioning of surface APP into lipid raft microdomains , we used primary hippocampal neurons from Sprague - Dawley rat embryos . Previous research showed that these neurons are fully matured at 21 - 35 days in vitro ( DIV21 - DIV35 ; stationary phase ) , and are characterized by pyramidal shaped cell bodies and intensive connections and networking of neurites ( Bertrand et al . , 2011 ) . Neurons ( DIV21 - DIV23 ) were incubated with 2 mM MβCD or 1 . 5 mM MβCD - cholesterol for 30 min to decrease or to increase cellular cholesterol levels , respectively . Then , neurons were incubated with 300 μg / ml filipin for 2 h to stain free cholesterol as shown in Fig 7A . Filipin fluorescent intensities were compared in Fig 7B . MβCD - cholesterol treatment elevated cholesterol levels by 33 . 3 ± 3 . 0 % ( n = 3 ) while MβCD treatment decreased cholesterol levels by 21 . 2 ± 2 . 1 % ( n = 3 ) . To monitor the localization of APP at the plasma membrane , cells were co - stained with APP antibody and CTB , a lipid raft marker . After fixing and permeabilizing , neurons were immunostained with NeuN antibody for 2 h to identify neurons . Surface membrane of both cell bodies and axons which were covered with cholesterol - enriched myelin sheet were stained with CTB ( Fig 7C , n = 4 ) . The endogenous neuronal APP was mostly localized in the cell bodies . Elevated cholesterol increased the co - localization of APP and CTB ( Fig 7D , n = 4 ) . In contrast , MβCD decreased the co - localization of APP - CTB . These results suggested that lipid raft localization of APP was regulated by cholesterol levels , a finding consistent with the results obtained from APP - transfected cells . Discussion Our data demonstrated that cholesterol recruited surface APP into lipid raft microdomains . Our findings also provided evidence of a direct relationship between APP localization in cholesterol - enriched lipid rafts and APP endocytosis as shown in Fig . 8 for our current model . Since Aβ is 15 produced from internalized APP in early endosomes and lysosomes , regulating APP localization in lipid rafts could be a promising new therapeutic target for Alzheimer’s disease . Many lines of evidence shed light on the role of cholesterol in AD ( Allinquant et al . , 2014 , Maulik et al . , 2013 ) . Changes in cholesterol homeostasis as well as other lipid classes in postmortem AD brain are considered to represent a third pathological feature of AD ( Fabelo et al . , 2014 , Heverin et al . , 2004 , Jarvik et al . , 1995 , Vanmierlo et al . , 2010 , Xiong et al . , 2008 ) . APP processing is highly influenced by membrane cholesterol since APP and the associated secretases are localized in cholesterol - enriched lipid raft structures ( Benjannet et al . , 2001 , Bhattacharyya et al . , 2013 , Hicks et al . , 2012 , Hur et al . , 2008 , Osenkowski et al . , 2008 ) . Lipid rafts have also been implicated in the regulation of several membrane trafficking and cell signaling pathways ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 , Kirkham & Parton , 2005a , Kirkham & Parton , 2005b , Okamoto et al . , 2000 ) . Lowering membrane cholesterol attenuates APP endocytosis and promotes non - amyloidogenic processing , while increasing membrane cholesterol levels escalates APP internalization into acidic intracellular compartments , enhancing Aβ production ( Cossec et al . , 2010 , Kojro et al . , 2001 ) . These findings suggested that the cholesterol composition of the plasma membrane and the distribution of APP in lipid rafts are critical for APP processing and Aβ generation . Indeed , we found that increasing or decreasing cholesterol levels regulated Aβ42 production , consistent with changes induced in APP endocytosis and localization in lipid rafts ( Fig EV5 ) . When we increased cellular cholesterol levels in CHO PS1 WT cells , the level of secreted Aβ42 was significantly increased . In contrast , the increased Aβ42 levels seen in the presence of elevated cholesterol in CHO PS1 ΔE9 cells was significantly reduced by decreasing cellular cholesterol level . Based on the co - localization evidence , elevated cholesterol levels in PS1 ΔE9 cells increased APP localization in both caveolin - and CTB - positive regions , which represent lipid raft microdomains . Manipulation of cellular cholesterol with MβCD or MβCD - cholesterol decreased or increased the degree of colocalization of APP - caveolin and APP - CTB , respectively . In addition to cell models expressing APP , we also used primary hippocampal neurons to show the effects of manipulating cellular cholesterol on the localization of endogenous APP in lipid raft microdomains . These findings 16 demonstrated that surface APP localization within lipid rafts was regulated by cellular cholesterol levels . This result was consistent with our previous report in which elevated cellular cholesterol increased APP localization in lipid rafts ( Cho et al . , 2019 ) . In addition , this lateral accumulation of APP in lipid rafts by the elevated cholesterol supports previous reports showing that cholesterol binds to the transmembrane region of APP / C99 and favors the formation of APP / C99 - cholesterol complex ( Barrett et al . , 2012 , Beel et al . , 2008 , Beel et al . , 2010 , Song et al . , 2013 , Song et al . , 2014 ) . Endocytosis is a serial process of membrane dynamics . Therefore , membrane lipid composition is critical for endocytic mechanisms ( Doherty & McMahon , 2009 , El - Sayed & Harashima , 2013 , Yue & Xu , 2015 ) . Also , the distribution of membrane proteins between lipid raft and non - lipid raft microdomains is thought to regulate the endocytosis of certain proteins ( Doherty & McMahon , 2009 , El - Sayed & Harashima , 2013 ) . Consistent with these results , we found that endogenously elevated cholesterol in CHO PS1 ΔE9 cells resulted in increased APP endocytosis compared to PS1 WT cells . However , the endocytosis of transferrin was not changed by the altered cholesterol levels . These results may suggest that general clathrin - dependent endocytosis is unaffected by the elevation in membrane cholesterol levels , while conversely , it did appear to be specific for the internalization of APP . The internalized APP was derived from both lipid raft and non - lipid raft microdomains . However , the elevated cholesterol level in CHO PS1 ΔE9 cells induced preferential internalization of APP from lipid rafts . When we depleted cholesterol levels with MβCD , the portion of internalized APP derived from lipid rafts was decreased . In addition , these cholesterol effects on APP localization and APP endocytosis were not cell - type specific since we recapitulated these effects using HeLa APPswe cells . We also found that modification of cholesterol content affected the amount of internalized APP reaching early endosomes . However , the rate of internalization was not affected by changing cholesterol levels . Thus , APP endocytosis itself , but not subsequent trafficking to early endosomes was altered by cholesterol levels . According to Cossec and colleagues , APP endocytosis is increased by cholesterol in a clathrin - dependent manner ( Cossec et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , our data showed that internalized APP originated from both raft and non - raft domains . In addition , APP internalization from both 17 microdomains was sensitive to cholesterol modulation . It has been proposed that the lipid raft - associated protein , flotillin , can cluster with APP into lipid raft microdomains by binding to its C - terminal region ( Chen et al . , 2006 , Schneider et al . , 2008 ) . APP can also bind cholesterol through its transmembrane domain ( Barrett et al . , 2012 , Beel et al . , 2008 , Beel et al . , 2010 , Song et al . , 2013 , Song et al . , 2014 ) . Taken together , it is possible that APP associated with either cholesterol or flotillins , is recruited to lipid raft microdomains , and that recruited APP in lipid rafts may be internalized to the endosomal / lysosomal subcellular trafficking system . This form of APP endocytosis may occur via raft - dependent pathways such as caveolin - or flotillin - mediated endocytosis ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 , Kirkham & Parton , 2005a , Kirkham & Parton , 2005b , Okamoto et al . , 2000 ) . Clathrin - dependent APP endocytosis is also affected by cellular cholesterol ( Cossec et al . , 2010 , McMahon & Boucrot , 2011 , Subtil et al . , 1999 ) , which is consistent with our result showing that the internalized APP from non - rafts was also changed by alterations of cholesterol levels . Considering the previous reports , our results may suggest that APP can be internalized through multiple pathways including both classical clathrin - dependent endocytosis and raft - induced endocytosis . Further studies would be needed to test this possibility . Materials & Methods Cell culture and experimental treatments Wild - type human APP751 expressing Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells ( Kang et al . , 2013 ) were stably transfected with either presenilin 1 wild type ( PS1 WT ) or ΔE9 mutant ( PS1 ΔE9 ) .
