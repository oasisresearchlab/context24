However , how macrophages monitor and maintain tissue integrity is not well understood . The extracellular matrix ( ECM ) is a key structural and organizational component of all tissues . Here , we find that macrophages sense the mechanical properties of the ECM to regulate a specific tissue repair program . We show that macrophage mechanosensing is mediated by cy - toskeletal remodeling and can be performed in three - dimensional environments through a noncanonical , integrin - independent mechanism analogous to amoeboid migration . We find that these cytoskeletal dynamics also integrate biochemical signaling by colony - stimulating factor 1 and ultimately regulate chromatin accessibil - ity to control the mechanosensitive gene expression program . This study identifies an “amoeboid” mode of ECM mechanosensing through which macrophages may regulate tissue repair and fibrosis . INTRODUCTION The extracellular matrix ( ECM ) is an organized assembly of proteins and polysaccharides that is produced by cells and , in turn , forms the physical environment in which cells reside . The ECM is a fundamen - tal feature of multicellular organisms , providing structural support and organization for cells within the tissue and conferring the partic - ular mechanical properties that are necessary for the proper function of that tissue ( 1 – 3 ) . The lungs , for instance , must be compliant and elastic to breathe , while the bone must be able to resist large forces to bear the body’s weight and maintain its structure . The composition of the ECM—the repertoire of ECM components , their concentrations , and their spatial arrangement—gives rise to the particular mechanical features of each tissue ( 4 ) . The composition and mechanical properties of the ECM can also undergo marked changes within a given organ . During tissue repair , activated fibroblasts called myofibroblasts deposit ECM compo - nents to reconstruct the injured tissue . This reparative phase must be followed by a phase of resolution , in which ECM deposition is suppressed and the ECM is remodeled , to return the tissue to a functional state . If repair instead persists and ECM deposition con - tinues , it can lead to the development of fibrosis—dense , stiff scar tissue that replaces normal , functioning tissue , ultimately causing organ failure ( 5 , 6 ) . Given its critical role in tissue organization , the ECM must be actively monitored , to maintain it in the appropriate state under normal conditions and to regulate the progression of tissue repair . Macrophages play an important role in maintaining tissue ho - meostasis by sensing and regulating a number of homeostatic vari - ables , such as oxygen tension and osmolarity ( 7 – 9 ) . Macrophages also play a key role in tissue repair . After tissue injury , monocytes produced in the bone marrow enter the tissue from the blood ( 10 , 11 ) , where they encounter the growth factor colony - stimulating fac - tor 1 ( CSF1 ) , which is produced by stromal cells such as fibroblasts and which induces monocyte differentiation into macrophages ( 12 – 15 ) . These macrophages drive ECM deposition by fibroblasts during repair ( 10 , 16 – 21 ) and can directly degrade and remodel ECM dur - ing resolution ( 22 – 27 ) . However , it remains unknown how these cel - lular activities are controlled . We hypothesized that macrophages sense the state of the ECM by monitoring its chemical and / or me - chanical properties . There are several reasons that macrophages may have evolved to sense ECM mechanics : ( i ) The mechanical characteristics of the ECM are an emergent property of the many individual ECM components , so measuring ECM mechanics is an efficient way to assess the state of the ECM as a whole ; ( ii ) the mechanical properties of the ECM are essential to its proper function ; and ( iii ) ECM stiffness changes mark - edly during tissue repair and may serve as a proxy to detect the pro - gression of repair and avoid fibrosis . A number of cell types are well established as mechanosensors of the ECM , including mesenchymal stem cells , fibroblasts , epithelial cells , endothelial cells , and smooth muscle cells ( 28 – 32 ) . The best known model of ECM mechanosensing , established through studies of these cell types , involves adhesion to the ECM via a family of cell surface receptors known as integrins ( 33 – 36 ) . Integrin receptors are coupled intracellularly to the actin cytoskeleton . In order for the cell to sense the stiffness of the ECM , the motor protein nonmuscle myo - sin II must pull on the actin cytoskeleton , which , in turn , exerts ten - sion on integrin receptors , which pull against their ECM ligands ( 28 , 29 , 33 , 35 , 37 , 38 ) . This integrin - dependent model of ECM mechanosensing has been established through studies of cell types , such as fibroblasts , that are typically stationary within tissues and that form firm adhesions to the ECM . When they do migrate , these cells must pull themselves along by exerting tension on their surroundings ( “crawling” ) , using integrin - based adhesions to the ECM and nonmuscle myosin II—the same mechanisms that they use for mechanosensing . This mode of migra - tion is known as mesenchymal migration . In contrast , while leukocytes can use integrin - based adhesions and do require integrins to adhere to two - dimensional ( 2D ) surfaces , they do not require integrin receptors to migrate within 3D tissues ( 39 ) . 1 department of immunobiology , Yale University School of Medicine , new haven , ct , USA . 2 department of Medicine , Massachusetts General hospital , Boston , MA , USA . 3 department of Biomedical engineering , Yale University , new haven , ct , USA . 4 center for translational immunology , University Medical center Utrecht , Utrecht University , Utrecht , netherlands . 5 Oncode institute , Utrecht , netherlands . 6 howard hughes Medical institute , Yale University School of Medicine , new haven , ct , USA . * corresponding author . email : ruslan . medzhitov @ yale . edu †these authors contributed equally to this work . copyright © 2024 the Authors , some rights reserved ; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science . no claim to original U .

This mode of migration is known as ameboid migration . Recent studies have revealed that macrophages on 2D surfaces can use the canonical mode of adhesion - dependent mechanosensing to detect substrate stiffness and activate established downstream mechanisms such as the mechanosensitive transcription factor yes - associated protein 1 ( YAP ) ( 38 , 42 ) . Mechanosensitive ion channels , which play a key role in responding to transient mechanical stimuli such as touch in sensory neurons ( 43 , 44 ) , have also been implicated in macrophage mechanosensing . Piezo - type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1 ( PIEZO1 ) mediates macrophage responses to cyclic pressure in the lungs , and there is evidence that PIEZO1 and transient receptor potential cation channel , subfamily V , member 4 ( TRPV4 ) are involved in sensing substrate stiffness on 2D surfaces , where they likely complement the adhesive function of integrins ( 45 – 49 ) . However , little is known about how macrophages in 3D tis - sues sense the properties of the ECM . Here , we find that macrophages in 3D environments can sense the mechanical properties of the ECM through a cytoskeleton - mediated but integrin - independent mechanism that resembles their mode of migration and is distinct from the canonical model of mechanosens - ing elucidated in strictly adhesive cell types such as fibroblasts . This macrophage mechanosensing pathway controls a specific gene ex - pression program involved in tissue repair . Signaling by the growth factor CSF1 also remodels the cytoskeleton to converge on the same gene expression program . We find that this cytoskeletal remodeling ultimately alters chromatin accessibility in a site - specific fashion to regulate gene expression . Last , we find in vivo that macrophages ex - hibit these same mechanosensitive responses at the cytoskeletal and transcriptional levels as tissue stiffness increases over the course of tissue repair . Altogether , this study identifies a specific tissue repair program in macrophages that is regulated by an integrin - independent mechanosensing mechanism . RESULTS Macrophages sense ECM mechanics to control tissue repair – associated gene expression To model a simple , well - defined tissue environment , we cultured bone marrow – derived macrophages ( BMDMs ) within 3D hydrogels composed of type I collagen , the most abundant ECM protein in most tissues ( Fig . 1A ) . To determine whether macrophages can sense changes in the ECM , we varied the concentration of collagen from 2 mg / ml ( low collagen ) to ~ 7 mg / ml ( high collagen ) . This change in concentration also altered the stiffness of the collagen gels—which varied from an elastic modulus of ~ 40 to 600 Pa ( fig . S1A ) , a range consistent with the softer mammalian tissues such as the brain and liver—and changed the pore size of the fibrillar network ( fig . S1 , B and C ) ( 50 ) . Interleukin - 4 ( IL - 4 ) induces a well - defined transcriptional pro - gram in macrophages to orchestrate a tissue - reparative response ( 51 ) . We hypothesized that the transcriptional response to IL - 4 may de - pend on the state of the ECM , in order to appropriately regulate repair . We found by RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) that macrophages cultured in high - collagen gels compared to low - collagen gels showed global differences in IL - 4 – induced gene expression ( Fig . 1B ) , suggest - ing that macrophages can sense and respond to the state of the ECM and integrate this information with the instructive signals provided by cytokines . Turning to a gene - based analysis , we identified a cluster of genes that were induced by IL - 4 and suppressed in high - collagen gels com - pared to low - collagen gels ( Fig . 1C ) . Several of these genes , including Fizz1 [ Retnla , resistin - like alpha ( RELM α ) ] , Rnase2a , Ear2 , Ym1 ( Chil3 ) , Fn1 , and Ccl24 , were consistently expressed at higher levels in low - collagen gels compared to high - collagen gels , while other genes induced by IL - 4 , such as Arg1 and Mrc1 , were consistently unaffected by the state of the ECM ( Fig . 1D ) . Fizz1 , one of the most highly regu - lated genes , is known to play a critical role in tissue repair in the lung and in the skin ( 21 , 52 ) . It is secreted by macrophages and is thought to act on fibroblasts to regulate myofibroblast differentiation , collagen production , and collagen cross - linking ( 21 , 53 ) . Expression of these ECM - sensitive genes , represented by Fizz1 , showed a dose response to the concentration of collagen , while ECM - insensitive genes , represented by Arg1 , did not ( fig . S1D ) . We confirmed these findings on the protein level by performing flow cy - tometry with intracellular protein staining ( fig . S1E ) . We found that found in inflammatory zone ( FIZZ1 ) protein levels were markedly suppressed in high - collagen gels compared to low - collagen gels , while arginase - 1 ( ARG1 ) protein levels were unaffected by the state of the ECM ( Fig . 1E ) . The identification of two distinct patterns of IL - 4 – induced gene expression suggested that the effects of the ECM were not mediated by changing the strength of IL - 4 signaling . Phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 ( STAT6 ) , the major medi - ator of IL - 4 signaling , was equivalent or even slightly increased in high - collagen gels compared to low - collagen gels , while FIZZ1 pro - tein expression was markedly reduced in high - collagen gels ( Fig . 1F ) . These data indicate that there are distinct subprograms induced by IL - 4 , which can be regulated independently . At least one of those pro - grams , represented by Fizz1 , is sensitive to changes in the tissue envi - ronment and in particular to the ECM . Next , we wanted to determine which specific features of the ECM are detected by macrophages . In collagen gels , the concentration of collagen is directly related to the mechanical properties of the hydro - gel ( fig . S1 , A to C ) . While this accurately reflects the relationship that exists in vivo as ECM accumulates , it limits our ability to experimen - tally dissect which properties of the ECM are monitored . To decouple ECM concentration from ECM mechanics , we cultured macrophages on polyacrylamide ( PA ) hydrogels conjugated to the major ECM pro - tein fibronectin ( Fig . 1G ) . In this system , the stiffness of the hydrogel can be controlled by varying the density of PA cross - linking , while the PA network is inert and not bound by cells . The cells bind to the con - jugated fibronectin , the concentration of which is held constant ( 28 , 54 ) . Thus , the effect of altering ECM stiffness can be isolated . When we cultured macrophages on high - stiffness ( ~ 20 kPa ) compared to low - stiffness ( ~ 400 Pa ) PA - fibronectin gels ( fig . S1F ) , the ECM - sensitive gene expression program was suppressed ( Fig . 1H ) , similar to what we observed in high - collagen gels compared to low - collagen gels . Meanwhile , ECM - independent genes such as Arg1 were again unaffected ( Fig . 1H ) . The higher stiffness range of the PA gels also indicates that macrophage mechanosensing can operate over a wide spectrum of tissue stiffness , including that of fibrotic lung and liver , Meizlish et al . , Sci .

Together , these data establish that macro - phages can sense ECM stiffness and that the ECM - sensitive program that we have identified is in fact a mechanosensitive gene expression program . Macrophage mechanosensing is mediated by cytoskeletal remodeling To dissect the mechanism of macrophage mechanosensing within tissues , we used the 3D collagen gel system . Using live - cell imaging , we observed that macrophages in low - collagen gels migrate more rapidly and over a greater distance than macrophages in high - collagen gels ( Fig . 2A and movies S1 and S2 ) . They also had marked differences in morphology : In low - collagen gels , macrophages were typically round or had short protrusions that rapidly turned over , while in high - collagen gels , they were often dendritic , with numerous long actin protrusions that retracted more slowly ( mov - ies S1 and S2 ) .

We hypothesized that these cytoskeletal dynamics may serve as an intracellular measure of the extracellular mechanical environment and may ultimately control the observed changes in gene expression . To test this hypothesis , we used chemical inhibitors to directly manipulate the macrophage cytoskeleton . When macrophages were treated with latrunculin A to inhibit actin polymerization , mechano - sensitive gene expression was potently suppressed , while nonmecha - nosensitive genes such as Arg1 and Mrc1 were unaffected ( Fig . 2D ) . Similarly , disrupting microtubule dynamics with nocodazole pro - foundly suppressed mechanosensitive genes such as Fizz1 , unlike other IL - 4 – induced genes such as Arg1 ( Fig . 2E ) . Together , these data suggest that macrophage mechanosensing is mediated by cytoskele - tal responses to the tissue environment and that these cytoskeletal dynamics specifically regulate the mechanosensitive subprogram of the macrophage IL - 4 response . Macrophages perform integrin - independent mechanosensing We next investigated whether integrin - based interactions with the ECM are required for macrophage mechanosensing , as would be ex - pected for mesenchymal cell types such as fibroblasts . We first asked whether fibroblasts follow the expected biological rules in this ex - perimental system . We found that murine embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) up - regulated established mechanosensitive genes Ctgf and α – smooth muscle actin ( Acta2 ) in high - collagen gels compared to low - collagen gels ( fig . S2A ) . We confirmed that fibroblast mechano - sensing in this setting requires nonmuscle myosin II ( using the in - hibitor blebbistatin ; fig . S2A ) and β 1 integrin ( using a β 1 integrin blocking antibody ; fig . S2B ) . These results are consistent with the prevailing model that fibroblast mechanosensing of the ECM re - quires integrin - based adhesion and mechanical tension exerted by nonmuscle myosin II . We then investigated whether macrophage mechanosensing is accomplished by the same mechanisms as adhesive cell types or in an integrin - independent fashion , analogous to leukocyte migra - tion in 3D tissues ( 39 – 41 ) . Both BMDMs and tissue - resident macrophages show minimal expression of canonical collagen - binding integrins , which are heterodimers composed of the β 1 integrin chain paired with the α 1 , α 2 , α 10 , or α 11 integrin chain ( fig . S3 ) ( 55 – 57 ) . When we inhibited the function of all of these collagen - binding pairs using the β 1 integrin blocking antibody , we found that it had no effect on mechanosensitive gene expres - sion ( Fig . 3A ) . Blocking β 2 integrin—the β chain for all of the “leukocyte integrins , ” which are classically involved in cell - cell interactions but some of which have also been reported to interact with collagen—also had no effect on ECM sensing ( Fig . 3B ) ( 58 , 59 ) . To further test the involvement of integrins , we performed small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) knockdown of Talin1 , an adapter protein that connects integrins to the cytoskeleton and is required for nearly all integrin activity . Although Talin1 expression was successfully suppressed , there was no effect on Fizz1 expression or responsiveness to the ECM ( Fig . 3C ) , further indicating that macrophage mechanosensing in 3D collagen gels is integrin inde - pendent . Inhibiting nonmuscle myosin II with blebbistatin sup - pressed Fizz1 expression , but it remained sensitive to changes in the ECM even after blebbistatin treatment ( Fig . 3D ) . These data indicate that macrophage mechanosensing in 3D collagen gels is mediated by the cytoskeleton but does not require integrin recep - tors or nonmuscle myosin II , unlike canonical mechanosensing in fibroblasts and other adhesive cell types . We also tested other mechanisms that have been implicated in macrophage mechanosensing on 2D surfaces ( 42 , 45 , 46 , 49 ) . We did not detect appreciable YAP expression in BMDMs ( fig . S4A ) and found that inhibiting the downstream transcription factor TEA do - main family member did not affect macrophage mechanosensing in 3D collagen gels ( fig . S4B ) . Investigating mechanosensitive ion channels , we found that deleting PIEZO1 did not change Fizz1 ex - pression ( fig . S4C ) , and neither inhibiting TRPV4 nor the class of mechanosensitive ion channels blunted macrophage responses to ECM ( fig . S4D ) . While these mechanisms may play an important role in integrin - dependent mechanosensing on 2D surfaces , they do not appear to mediate integrin - independent mechanosensing by macrophages within 3D tissues . Macrophage growth factor CSF1 remodels the cytoskeleton to regulate the mechanosensitive gene expression program Macrophages sense many other features of the tissue environ - ment , in addition to ECM mechanics ( 7 , 9 ) . Among the most im - portant regulators of macrophage biology is the lineage - restricted growth factor CSF1 , which stimulates monocyte - to - macrophage differentiation , as well as macrophage survival and proliferation . CSF1 is produced by other cell types within the tissue , such as fibroblasts , and it can serve as an indicator of fibroblast cell num - ber , which changes dynamically during tissue repair ( 12 – 15 ) . To our surprise , we found that stimulation of macrophages with re - combinant CSF1 specifically suppressed the mechanosensitive gene expression program that we had identified , similar to high - stiffness environments , while it increased or had no effect on the expression of nonmechanosensitive IL - 4 – induced genes such as Arg1 and Mrc1 ( Fig . 4A ) . We confirmed these findings for FIZZ1 and ARG1 on the protein level by flow cytometry ( Fig . 4B ) . We also observed that CSF1 induces an elongated macrophage mor - phology on tissue culture ( TC ) plates ( Fig . 4C ) . We then per - formed live - cell microscopy and confocal imaging in 3D collagen gels , which showed that macrophages treated with CSF1 become highly dendritic in 3D environments , migrating more slowly and extending long actin protrusions ( Fig . 4 , D to F , and movies S3 and S4 ) , similar to the macrophage behavior we observed in high - collagen gels . Thus , CSF1 and high - stiffness ECM have similar effects on both macrophage cytoskeletal dynamics and gene expression . Because we found that the effects of ECM mechanics on macrophage gene expression are mediated through cytoskeletal dynamics , we reasoned that CSF1 may also act through its effects on the cytoskeleton to control the mechanosensitive gene expres - sion program . To test this hypothesis , we treated macrophages with CSF1 under normal conditions or after pharmacologically disrupting the cytoskeleton . Consistent with our findings for macrophage mechanosensing , CSF1 suppressed Fizz1 even after inhibition of nonmuscle myosin II with blebbistatin ( Fig . 4G ) . However , the effect of CSF1 on Fizz1 expression was not observed in the presence of actin ( Fig . 4H ) or microtubule inhibitors ( Fig . 4I ) . In contrast , the induction of Arg1 by CSF1 was unaf - fected by actin inhibition ( Fig . 4H ) , although interestingly was no longer observed in the presence of nocodazole ( Fig . 4I ) . To further explore the role of actin regulation in control of the tissue repair Meizlish et al . , Sci .

Similar to increased ECM stiffness and CSF1 treatment , activation of these guanosine triphosphatases suppressed Fizz1 without affecting Arg1 expression ( Fig . 4J ) , further supporting the model that cytoskeletal dynamics regulate the mechanosensitive gene expression program . Altogether , we find that CSF1 signal - ing , like ECM mechanosensing , acts through cytoskeletal remod - eling to regulate a specific tissue repair program in macrophages that is sensitive to changes in the tissue environment . Cytoskeletal remodeling controls site - specific chromatin accessibility Next , we investigated how cytoskeletal remodeling in macrophages ultimately controls transcriptional regulation . To determine whether changes in actin dynamics result in changes in chromatin accessibil - ity , we performed assay for transposase - accessible chromatin with high - throughput sequencing ( ATAC - seq ) in BMDMs treated with or without IL - 4 and with or without latrunculin A and CSF1 , both of which suppress expression of Fizz1 by acting on the macrophage cy - toskeleton .

Several motifs were highly enriched , including CCAAT / enhancer binding protein ( C / EBP ) and STAT6 , which bind to the Fizz1 promoter to activate Fizz1 expression ( 61 ) . We then analyzed the chromatin regions closed by latrunculin A and CSF1 in the absence of IL - 4 stimulation ( untreated ; Fig . 5D ) . We found a highly overlapping set of enriched motifs . The top 10 tran - scription factor motifs ( ranked by statistical significance ) in the IL - 4 context also appeared in the top 15 motifs in the untreated context . These results suggest that cytoskeletal remodeling may regulate par - ticular regions of chromatin , preparing the chromatin landscape for— and modulating the response to—additional signals , such as IL - 4 , that trigger transcriptional activation . These data also propose a candidate set of transcription factors that may be involved in mechanosensitive gene regulation in macrophages across biological contexts . Macrophages exhibit cytoskeletal remodeling and mechanosensitive gene regulation as ECM accumulates during tissue repair Last , we tested the hypothesis that mechanosensing allows macro - phages to respond to changes in tissue stiffness in vivo during the course of tissue repair . Using a bleomycin lung injury model , we ob - served a progressive increase in ECM deposition ( Fig . 6A ) , and col - lagen in particular ( Fig . 6B ) , in the days after the initial injury , leading to tissue fibrosis by day 12 , as expected ( 64 ) . Consistent with our find - ings in bioengineered hydrogels , this increase in tissue stiffness over time was accompanied by suppression of Fizz1 gene expression in the lung , while Arg1 expression was unaffected ( Fig . 6C ) . Using flow cy - tometry with intracellular protein staining , we confirmed that macro - phages in the lung suppress FIZZ1 production while maintaining steady ARG1 production as tissue repair progresses ( Fig . 6D and fig . S5 ) . Last , we asked whether macrophages exhibit the same cyto - skeletal responses to changing ECM mechanics in the lungs as we ob - served in vitro . We stained tissue sections using antibodies against collagen I and the macrophage marker F4 / 80 , to assess macrophage morphology . As collagen accumulated over time , the macrophages in the lung became less spherical and increasingly dendritic ( Fig . 6 , E and F ) . These results are consistent with our findings in 3D collagen hydrogels , suggesting that the mechanosensing program that we iden - tified in vitro is operative in complex tissues in vivo and is sensitive to the dynamic changes in ECM that take place during tissue repair . DISCUSSION In this study , we found that macrophages can sense the mechanical properties of their environment to regulate a specific tissue repair program . We identified an integrin - independent mechanosensing mechanism that functions through changes in intracellular cyto - skeletal dynamics , which can also integrate signaling by the growth factor CSF1 . We found that these cytoskeletal dynamics ultimately modify chromatin availability to regulate mechanosensitive gene expression . Last , we saw that macrophages in the lung exhibit these mechanosensitive responses as ECM accumulates during tissue re - pair . Taken together , we found that the macrophage cytoskeleton integrates mechanical and biochemical information from the envi - ronment to regulate a transcriptional program involved in ECM regulation and tissue repair ( Fig . 7 ) . Although the ECM is a fundamental element of all tissues , the logic of its regulation is poorly understood . Fibroblasts are the major producers of ECM within tissues and are well - established sensors of ECM mechanics . Paradoxically , however , when fibroblasts sense in - creased ECM stiffness , they respond by increasing ECM deposition and contraction , further stiffening the ECM ( 65 – 67 ) . Thus , fibroblasts appear to be engaged in a positive feedback loop with respect to the ECM , which , if unrestrained , can lead to fibrosis . However , in most cases , ECM is maintained in the appropriate state under homeostatic conditions , and tissue repair is successfully resolved without resulting in fibrosis . These outcomes indicate that there must be a source of negative feedback on ECM deposition that has not yet been identified . We hypothesized that macrophages may act as ECM sensors to nega - tively regulate ECM deposition and tissue repair . In this study , we found that macrophage sensing of increased ECM stiffness suppresses a proreparative gene expression program . The same program is suppressed by increased CSF1 concentration , which likely serves to report on the number of local fibroblasts , the predom - inant producers of ECM ( 12 , 14 ) . This tissue repair program includes the genes Fizz1 , which drives fibroblast deposition and cross - linking of collagen and is essential for tissue repair in the skin and the lungs ( 21 , 52 , 53 , 68 ) ; Ccl24 , a chemokine for eosinophils that promotes fi - brosis in multiple organs ( 69 – 71 ) ; and fibronectin ( Fn1 ) , a key ECM protein involved in tissue repair and fibrosis ( 5 , 72 ) . We found that this proreparative program is also suppressed in vivo as tissue repair progresses and tissue stiffness increases . It is known that macrophages are required for successful resolution of tissue repair ( 17 , 22 ) , and these findings suggest that macrophage sensing of ECM mechanics could provide the necessary source of negative feedback to maintain ECM homeostasis and prevent unrestrained tissue repair . Macrophages are able to activate distinct transcriptional programs known as polarization states to participate in diverse biological pro - cesses . The polarization state involved in tissue repair is traditionally known as the “M2” state and can be induced in vitro by the cytokines IL - 4 or IL - 13 . When M2 macrophages are identified in vivo , however , they often express some but not all of the classic marker genes in - duced by M2 polarization in vitro . This disconnect is poorly under - stood but may reflect the fact that macrophages respond not only to polarizing signals such as IL - 4 but also to other information within the tissue environment , as has been suggested by others ( 73 ) . In re - sponse to these cues , macrophages may tune their polarization state to meet the specific functional demands of the tissue ( 7 ) . Consistent with this model , we found in this study that a subset of IL - 4 – induced genes are regulated by key features of the tissue environment—the mechanical properties of the ECM and the abundance of CSF1— while others are insensitive to these inputs . Furthermore , we deter - mined that these environmental inputs are converted to site - specific changes in chromatin availability . This offers an example of separable programs within the M2 polarization state that are tunable in re - sponse to the tissue environment . This work has uncovered a mechanism of mechanosensing by macrophages that is fundamentally distinct from adhesive cell types , in which ECM mechanosensing has traditionally been studied . Whereas cells such as fibroblasts anchor to the ECM using integrin receptors and exert pulling forces using nonmuscle myosin II to measure the stiffness of the ECM , we found that macrophages in 3D environments do not require integrin - based adhesions or nonmus - cle myosin II function to sense ECM mechanics . This distinction maps onto the differences between the mesenchymal mode of mi - gration used by adhesive cell types such as fibroblasts and the amoe - boid mode of migration adopted by leukocytes in 3D environments . Thus , we can conceptualize the classical , integrin - dependent mode Meizlish et al . , Sci .

However , one fundamental dis - tinction is that , while mesenchymal migration depends on binding to the ECM and pulling to achieve locomotion , amoeboid migration does not require adhesion and instead depends on actin filaments pushing outward at the cell membrane against compressive forces ( 39 – 41 , 74 – 77 ) . Rather than sensing mechanical tension , therefore , macrophages are likely to sense mechanical compression as they mi - grate within the tissue . That is , macrophage mechanosensing may work by pushing , rather than pulling . It is noteworthy that we made these findings in a 3D tissue envi - ronment . Concurrent work has shown that macrophages and T cells can sense ECM stiffness on 2D surfaces ( 42 , 46 , 78 ) . In this context , macrophages attach to the underlying ECM and likely use mechano - sensing mechanisms that are more similar to adhesive cell types . The seminal studies on integrin - independent leukocyte migration within 3D tissues also showed that leukocytes do require integrins to migrate on 2D surfaces ( 39 ) . Recent work has further shown that macro - phages can use both integrin - dependent and integrin - independent modes of migration in 3D environments , depending on ligand avail - ability and the stimulus for migration ( 79 ) . Thus , macrophages may use different mechanosensing strategies—amoeboid or mesenchy - mal—depending on the tissue context and whether they are sitting upon or embedded within the ECM . While most macrophages reside in 3D spaces , osteoclasts , alveolar macrophages , and Kupffer cells ef - fectively occupy 2D surfaces and may thus rely on a mesenchymal mechanosensing strategy , similar to other adhesive cell types . Mean - while , the amoeboid mode of mechanosensing described here may be used within interstitial spaces not only by macrophages but also by other leukocytes and other cell types , such as cancer cells , that are capable of amoeboid migration ( 77 ) . Last , we identified the cytoskeleton as a signal integrator for mac - rophages . We found that changes in the actin cytoskeleton not only mediate macrophage mechanosensing but are also required for CSF1 to regulate a subset of its genetic targets . This result was unexpected . In the case of mechanosensing , it is somewhat intuitive that extracel - lular structural or mechanical information ( in the ECM ) would be translated to intracellular structural information ( in the cytoskeleton ) before being converted to a biochemical signal to regulate gene ex - pression . In the case of growth factor signaling , however , it is not in - tuitive why an extracellular biochemical signal ( CSF1 ) would act through a cytoskeletal intermediary before being converted back to biochemical information . However , this model also appears elsewhere in biology . The best - elucidated example is the regulation , in fibro - blasts and other mesenchymal cells , of the transcription factor serum response factor ( SRF ) . Growth factors present in fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) induce polymerization of G - actin to F - actin , which causes the transcriptional coactivator myocardin related transcription factor ( MRTF ) , normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by G - actin mono - mers , to be released to the nucleus , where it forms a complex with SRF and initiates transcription ( 80 – 83 ) . Thus , as in CSF1 stimulation of macrophages , a biochemical signal induces cytoskeletal remodeling as an intermediate step to control gene expression . In this case , as in macrophages , these cytoskeletal dynamics are also sensitive to ECM mechanics : Stiff substrates induce increased actin polymerization in fibroblasts as well , causing MRTF to be released to the nucleus ( 67 ) . Thus , our findings appear to be an example of a broader biological theme , in which the cytoskeleton acts as an integrator of diverse types of information—both mechanical and biochemical—to control gene expression programs . We can speculate as to why the cytoskeleton might have evolved to act as a signal integrator . The cytoskeleton is one of the most ancient features of eukaryotic cells , is essential for the cell’s interaction with its environment , and is critical for a wide range of fundamental cellular activities , including migration , cell division , phagocytosis , protein se - cretion , and cellular organization within tissues . Cells may have evolved the strategy of measuring cytoskeletal dynamics as a key indi - cator of both the external state of the tissue and the internal state of the cell , in order to appropriately regulate gene expression programs that need to respond to these cues . Another advantage of using the cytoskeleton as a signaling hub is that it may allow for unique mecha - nisms of transcriptional regulation that cannot be achieved through canonical signal transduction pathways . For instance , we found here that changes in cytoskeletal dynamics ultimately control chromatin Fig . 7 . Model : ECM mechanics and CSF1 signaling are integrated through cytoskeletal remodeling to regulate tissue repair – associated gene expres - sion in macrophages . Macrophages sense ecM mechanics through integrin - independent cytoskeletal remodeling to regulate the expression of a subset of tissue repair – associated genes induced by il - 4 , including Fizz1 . Signaling by cSF1 , the lineage - restricted growth factor for macrophages , also converges on these cytoskeletal dynamics to regulate this mechanosensitive gene expression program . Macrophage cytoskeletal dynamics ultimately control chromatin ac - cessibility at regulatory elements of target genes , translating environmental sensing into transcriptional regulation . these mechanisms may allow for appro - priate regulation of tissue repair : As ecM stiffness and cSF1 production increase over the course of repair , macrophages undergo cytoskeletal remodeling and suppress genes that drive repair , which may be critical for resolving tissue repair and avoiding fibrosis .

This may take place through mechanical effects of the cy - toskeleton on the nuclear membrane ( 84 , 85 ) or through regulation of nuclear actin ( 86 – 88 ) , offering pathways for targeted regulation of mechanosensitive and other cytoskeleton - dependent gene expression programs . This study also raises fundamental questions for future study , in - cluding precisely how extracellular mechanical information is trans - lated into intracellular changes in the cytoskeleton , what specific properties of the actin cytoskeleton are measured by macrophages , and how these changes ultimately control chromatin availability . More broadly , the role of the cytoskeleton in integrating biological in - formation and regulating diverse cellular functions is likely to repre - sent a promising area for future exploration across biological fields . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture Bone marrow – derived macrophages BMDMs were differentiated from mouse bone marrow cells in mac - rophage growth medium ( MGM ) composed of 30 % L929 cell – conditioned medium and 70 % complete RPMI medium ( cRPMI ) , which consisted of RPMI 1640 ( Corning ) supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated FBS ( Gibco ) , 2 mM l - glutamine , penicillin / streptomycin ( 200 U / ml ) , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , and 10 mM Hepes . Bone mar - row was prepared by crushing C57BL / 6J mouse femurs and tibias to release marrow , followed by ACK ( ammonium - chloride - potassium ) lysis of red blood cells and passage through a 70 - μ m cell strainer . Bone marrow was plated at 5 × 10 6 cells in 20 ml of MGM in a non - TC dish ( day 0 ) . Every 3 days , cells were supplemented with 10 ml of MGM . After day 6 , adherent cells were lifted with cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 5 mM EDTA and used for experi - ments . Bone marrow cells derived from Piezo1 f / f and LysM Cre / + Piezo1 f / f mice were provided by R . Flavell ( Yale University ) ( 45 ) . Murine embryonic fibroblasts Embryonic day 13 . 5 ( E13 . 5 ) to E14 . 5 embryos were collected from a pregnant female by removing the uterus and separating each em - bryo from its amniotic sac . The head and “red tissue , ” including fe - tal liver , were removed and discarded . The remaining portion of each embryo was minced using razor blades in 0 . 05 % trypsin + EDTA and placed in a 37°C incubator for 30 min . After digestion , the tissue was washed and plated in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium [ Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium + 10 % FBS , 2 mM l - glutamine , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , 10 mM Hepes , and penicillin / streptomycin ( 200 U / ml ) ] in 15 - cm TC plates overnight . The following day , cells and undigested tissue debris were lifted from the plates using 0 . 05 % trypsin + EDTA ( Gibco ) and filtered over a 70 - μ m cell strainer . These cells were expanded for one to two passages and then sorted for CD45 , CD11b , and F4 / 80 negativity to exclude contaminating macrophages . The sorted MEFs were split once after sorting to allow for recovery and used for experiments between passage 3 and passage 7 . Reagents For stimulation of BMDMs , recombinant murine IL - 4 ( PeproTech , 214 - 14 ) was used at 20 ng / ml , and recombinant murine CSF1 ( Cell Signaling Technologies , 5228 ) at 100 ng / ml for 2D culture and 200 ng / ml for 3D culture . Chemical inhibitors used in cell culture included latrunculin A ( Cayman Chemical , 10010630 , or Sigma - Aldrich , 428021 ) , ( − ) - blebbistatin ( Sigma - Aldrich , B0560 ) , and nocodazole ( Sigma - Aldrich , M1404 ) , which were used at 1 , 25 , and 10 μ M , respectively . K - 975 ( Sellek Chemicals , E1329 ) , RN - 1734 ( Cayman Chemical , 24205 ) , and HC - 067047 ( Cayman Chemical , 20927 ) were all used at 10 μ M . GsMTx4 ( Abcam , ab141871 ) was used at 5 μ M . ML099 ( Cayman Chemical , 15176 ) was used at 100 μ M . For antibody blockade of cell surface receptors , cells were prein - cubated in a small volume of medium with antibody ( 160 μ g / ml ) for 15 min at room temperature , followed by dilution to a final concen - tration of 20 μ g / ml for the duration of the experiment . β 1 integrin blockade was performed with Purified NA / LE Hamster Anti - Rat CD29 ( clone Ha2 / 5 , BD Pharmingen , 555002 ) and the isotype con - trol antibody Purified NA / LE Hamster IgM , λ 1 Isotype Control ( clone G235 - 1 , BD Pharmingen , 553957 ) . β 2 integrin blockade was performed with Purified NA / LE Rat Anti - Mouse CD18 ( clone GAME - 46 , BD Pharmingen , 555280 ) and the isotype control anti - body Purified NA / LE Rat Ig1 , κ Isotype Control ( clone R3 - 34 , BD Pharmingen , 553921 ) . 3D collagen gels Preparation of 3D collagen gels with embedded cells for cell culture 3D collagen gels with embedded BMDMs or MEFs were synthesized using high - concentration rat tail collagen I ( Corning , 354249 ) , using a protocol adapted from Corning’s “alternate gelation procedure” pro - vided with the product . Briefly , Collagen was mixed with 10 × PBS and sterile H 2 O to achieve the desired collagen concentration . Subse - quently , 1 N of NaOH was added to neutralize the acetic acid in the collagen solution until a pH of 7 to 7 . 5 was achieved , measured by pH strip . BMDMs or MEFs were added to the collagen solution at 0 . 5 × 10 6 to 1 × 10 6 cells or 0 . 2 × 10 6 cells per gel , respectively . Cells were added such that they made up one - eighth of the volume of the gel . Collagen - cell solutions were then plated at 200 μ l in 48 - well non - TC plates . Until this step , collagen solution was kept on ice as much as possible . After collagen - cell solutions were plated , they were incubated for 45 min to 1 . 5 hours at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 to achieve gelation . A small pipette tip was used to score around the edge of the gels to de - tach them from the walls of the wells and ensure that they float to avoid cells interacting with the stiff bottom of the plate . Medium ( 400 or 500 μ l ) was then added , including any stimulation or inhibitors at the appropriate concentrations , and the gels were scored once again before placing them back in the incubator for the duration of the experiment . Harvesting RNA for quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from cells in 3D collagen gels After stimulation for 16 to 28 hours , gels were transferred with curved , blunt , serrated forceps to a 24 - well non - TC plate , rinsing forceps in PBS between handling each gel . RNA - Bee ( Tel - Test ; 1 ml ) was then added to each gel and allowed to sit for 5 min or until gels began to fragment . RNA - Bee and gel were pipetted up and down until the gel disintegrated and the solution was homogenous . This solution was processed for RNA purification . Harvesting protein for Western blot from cells in 3D collagen gels Using curved , blunt , serrated forceps , gels were transferred to 200 μ l of 2 × SDS – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buf - fer with β - mercaptoethanol and protease / phosphatase inhibitor that was preheated at 105°C . Samples were further heated at 105°C for 15 min , visualized to ensure homogenization , and used for Western blot . Meizlish et al . , Sci . Adv . 10 , eadk6906 ( 2024 ) 13 March 2024 S c i e n c e A d vAn c eS | R eSeA R c h AR t i c l e 13 of 17 Harvesting cells from 3D collagen gels for flow cytometry Collagenase type IV ( Worthington , LS004189 ) was added at 18 mg / ml , 100 μ l per well , to 500 μ l medium in which cells were cultured for a final concentration of 3 mg / ml . Gels were diced with clean scissors directly in the wells . After plates were rotated at 205 rpm for 20 min , samples were transferred to conical tubes through a cell strainer , using the top of a plunger to completely mash the partially digested gels . Following two washes with PBS , cells were collected with the centrifu - gation at 1350 rpm ( 385 g ) at 4°C for 5 min . Confocal microscopy of cells in 3D collagen gels In preparation for confocal microscopy , 200 μ l of collagen gels were prepared in chambers with coverglass well - bottoms ( Lab - Tek Chambered # 1 . 0 Borosilicate Coverglass System , 8 - chamber ) . Gels were not scored so that they would sit on the bottom of the well to be as close as possible to the microscope objective . After gelation , 300 μ l of medium with recombinant IL - 4 and / or CSF1 was added . At the end of the experiment , medium was removed with a pipette , gels were washed gently with PBS , and gels were fixed in 300 μ l of 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 1 hour at room temperature on a bench - top rotator . Gels were washed three times with 400 μ l of PBS and then permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 for 1 hour at room temperature on the rotator . Gels were washed three more times with PBS and incubated with Phalloidin - Texas Red ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , T7471 ) at 1 : 50 in PBS / 5 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) for 1 hour in the dark at room temperature on the rotator . Gels were then counterstained with 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) in PBS for 5 min . Gels were washed three more times with PBS , rotating for 5 min in the dark for each wash . Gels were kept in PBS and imaged by Leica SP8 confocal microscopy , scanning for cells that do not contact the bottom of the gel and obtaining Z stacks to capture several whole cells in each image , which were then used for downstream analyses . Cellular morphology was quantified using Imaris 9 . 8 software ( Oxford Instruments ) for all cells captured in the acquired confocal images . “Surfaces” were created automatically in the phalloidin channel using the default setting of 0 . 359 μ m for “surfaces detail” to avoid bias and were then filtered manually to include only genuine cells and only cells whose borders were fully captured . The software was then used to calculate cell sphericity . PA - fibronectin gels PA gel fabrication Hydrogels were generated by polymerizing various ratios of solu - tions of acrylamide ( Bio - Rad ; 3 and 10 % for low and high stiff - ness , respectively ) and bis - acrylamide ( Bio - Rad ; 0 . 3 and 0 . 225 % for low and high stiffness , respectively ) with ammonium persul - fate ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and tetramethylethylenediamine ( Bio - Rad ) sandwiched between two glass coverslips . One coverslip was activated with 3 - aminopropyltriethoxysilane using 0 . 1 M NaOH ( Macron Fine Chemicals ) and 0 . 05 % glutaraldehyde ( Polysciences Inc . ) and the other coated with dichloromethylsilane ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Fibronectin was conjugated to the polymerized hydro - gels by succinimide chemistry . Briefly , sulfo - sulfosuccinimidyl 6 - ( 4 ′ - azido - 2 ′ - nitrophenylamino ) hexanoate ( SANPAH , 0 . 2 mg / ml ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) in 50 mM Hepes ( Sigma - Aldrich ) were placed under ultraviolet ( 365 nm , 10 mW / cm ) , washed thoroughly with Hepes , and incubated overnight with fibronectin ( 0 . 2 mg / ml ; Millipore ) at 37°C . After incubation , the hydrogels were washed and kept at 4°C until cell seeding . Cell culture on PA - fibronectin gels Gels ( attached to coverslips ) were transferred to six - well non - TC plates using sterile , curved , pointed forceps . BMDMs ( 0 . 85 × 10 6 cells per gel in 250 μ l of cRPMI ) were gently plated at the center of each gel such that the medium formed a meniscus and did not spread beyond the border of the gel . Cells were left to incubate undisturbed for 30 min to 1 hour , after which adhesion was confirmed by microscopy . An additional 1 . 75 ml of cRPMI was then added to each gel gently such that the cells were not disrupted . Cell culture plates were then returned to the incubator for 3 hours , after which the stimulation with IL - 4 was performed . Cells were then incubated for an additional 16 hours before RNA collection . RNA isolation from PA - fibronectin gels Gels were transferred to new six - well non - TC plates , taking care to cause minimal mechanical disruption . RNeasy RLT buffer ( QIAGEN ) with 1 : 100 β - mercaptoethanol was added to the center of the gel at 350 μ l per gel . Several minutes later , RLT buffer on each gel was gently pipetted up and down and collected . RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Micro Kit ( QIAGEN ) according to the manufacturer’s in - structions . Scanning electron microscopy Collagen gels ( 400 μ l ) were formed in 24 - well plates and incubated in cRPMI medium overnight before fixation in 4 % PFA for 10 min . Hy - drogels were then snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized overnight . Freeze - dried samples were sputter - coated with palladium and imaged via scanning electron microscopy ( Hitachi , SU - 70 ) . Im - ages were taken at 10 kV for pore quantification . The width of indi - vidual pores was analyzed from scanning electron microscopy images using ImageJ , quantifying the pore size as the distance between fibers in 3D space ( 89 ) . Rheology A PA or collagen hydrogel was cast between the rheometer base plate and 25 - mm - diameter parallel plate . Gels were swollen over - night and kept hydrated during testing . The shear modulus of the gel was measured using a strain amplitude sweep of 0 . 1 to 10 % strain at a constant frequency rate ( 1 rad / s ) . The measured shear modulus remained constant over the specified strain range . The elastic modu - lus was calculated using the shear modulus values , assuming that the gels were incompressible ( Poisson ratio = 0 . 5 ) . RNA isolation , cDNA synthesis , and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction After cell collection in RNA - Bee , RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s instructions , except when isolating RNA from PA gels as indicated . To synthesize cDNA , RNA was annealed to oligo - dT6 primers , and cDNA was reverse - transcribed with moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase ( Clontech ) . Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) was performed on a CFX96 or CFX384 Real - Time System ( Bio - Rad ) using PerfeCTa SYBR Green SuperMix ( Quanta Biosciences ) . Relative expression units were typically calculated as transcript levels of target genes rela - tive to Rpl13a . Primers used for qRT - PCR are listed in table S1 . Live - cell imaging Image acquisition was performed with Leica AF6000 Modular Sys - tem with stage - top incubator INUBTFP - WSKM - F1 ( Tokai Hit ) maintained at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Multiple images were acquired Meizlish et al . , Sci .

Imaris 9 . 8 was used to track individual cells throughout the video to quantify the max track speed and track displacement length of each cell . “Brownian motion” was used for the tracking algorithm , in which maximum distance and maximum gap size were set as 5 μ m and 5 , respectively . Flow cytometry All staining steps and washes before cell fixation and permeabilization were performed in fluorescence - activated cell sorting buffer ( PBS with 2 % FBS and 0 . 01 % sodium azide ) . Cells were incubated with anti - CD16 / CD32 ( clone 93 , eBioscience , 14 - 0161 - 86 ) for Fc receptor blockade and stained with Zombie Yellow ( BioLegend ) for 10 min at room temperature in the dark to distinguish live and dead cells . For lung cells , cell surface markers were stained with the following antibodies : anti – CD11c – fluorescein isothiocyanate ( clone N418 , eBioscience , 11 - 0114 - 85 ) , CD64 – Brilliant Violet 421 ( clone X54 - 5 / 7 . 1 , BioLegend , 139309 ) , Ly6G - PerCP - Cy5 . 5 ( clone 1A8 , BD Bio - sciences , 560602 ) , F4 / 80 – phycoerythrin ( PE ) / Cyanine7 ( clone BM8 , BioLegend , 123113 ) , CD45 . 2 - BUV395 ( clone 104 , BD Biosciences , 564616 ) , and CD11b - BUV737 ( clone M1 / 70 , BD Biosciences , 612800 ) . After washing , cells were fixed and permeabilized with BD Cytofix / Cytoperm for 15 to 20 min . Cells were then washed with BD Perm / Wash , and intracellular staining was performed in BD Perm / Wash for 45 min at room temperature or at 4°C overnight . Antibodies included anti – FIZZ1 - phycoerythrin ( PE ) ( clone DS8RELM , eBioscience , 12 - 5441 - 80 ) and ARG1 - allophycocyanin ( APC ) ( clone A1exF5 , eBioscience , 17 - 3697 - 82 ) . Rat immunoglobulin 1 κ ( IgG1 κ ) – PE ( clone R3 - 34 , BD Biosciences , 554685 ) and rat IgG2a κ - APC ( clone eBR2a , eBioscience , 17 - 4321 - 81 ) were also used as isotype control for gating FIZZ1 - and ARG1 - positive cells , respectively . After washing with BD Perm / Wash , cells were run on a BD LSR II Green , followed by analysis with FlowJo software ( FlowJo LLC ) . Western blot Samples were run on Bio - Rad Mini - PROTEAN TGX Stain - Free Gels , 4 to 15 % , with a 10 - or 12 - well comb in tris / glycine / SDS buffer . Protein was transferred onto activated polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using the Bio - Rad Trans - Blot Turbo system according to the manufac - turer’s instructions . Membranes were blocked with TBST ( 20 mM tris , 150 mM NaCl , and 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ) / 5 % BSA for 1 hour and then in - cubated with primary antibodies in TBST / 5 % BSA with sodium azide at 4°C overnight . Primary antibodies included rabbit anti – phospho - STAT6 ( Cell Signaling Technologies , 56554 ) , rabbit anti - RELM α ( PeproTech , 500 - P214 ) , and mouse anti – glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 32233 ) . Membranes were washed three times with TBST and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase – conjugated secondary antibodies ( anti - rabbit or anti - mouse ) for 1 hour at room temperature . Membranes were washed three more times and then developed using Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) or SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Protein was visualized using the Bio - Rad Image Lab system . Talin1 knockdown Gene knockdown was performed using P2 Primary Cell 4D - Nucleofector X Kit ( Lonza ) according to the manufacturer’s instruc - tions with modification . Briefly , 2 × 10 6 BMDMs in a cuvette were transfected with 500 pmol of MISSION siRNA Universal Negative Control # 1 or TLN1 siRNA ( ID : SASI _ Mm01 _ 00114842 ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) with the protocol “Mouse , macrophage” programmed in 4D - Nucleofector ( Lonza ) . Cells were cultured in medium composed of 50 % L929 cell – conditioned medium and 50 % cRPMI . Two days later , cells were harvested and used for 3D culture . BMDM culture on TC plate BMDMs were seeded at 0 . 33 × 10 6 cells per well of a 12 - well dish . After stimulation for 20 to 24 hours , cells were photographed using a Zeiss Axio Vert . A1 microscope for cell morphology analysis , lysed in RNA - Bee for mRNA expression analysis , or detached with PBS + 5 mM EDTA as described above for flow cytometry analysis . RNA - seq analysis The aqueous phase after chloroform extraction from RNA - Bee so - lution was mixed 1 : 1 with 70 % ethanol and further processed with QIAGEN RNeasy Mini columns , with on - column deoxyribonuclease treatment , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Sequencing libraries were constructed following Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA protocol . Paired - end sequencing was performed with NextSeq 500 with paired - end reads of 38 base pairs . Illumina fastq files were down - loaded from Illumina Basespace and were aligned with Kallisto v0 . 46 . 1 using the “ - b 100 and - t 20” options to obtain transcript abun - dances in transcripts per million and estimated counts ( 90 ) . The kal - listo index used during transcript quantification was built from the Mus musculus transcriptome GRCm38 downloaded as a fasta file from Ensembl ( ftp : / / ftp . ensembl . org / pub / release - 90 / fasta / mus _ mus - culus / cdna / s ) . Transcripts were annotated using the Bioconductor package biomaRt v2 . 40 . 5 ( 91 ) . Significant differences in gene expres - sion between conditions were calculated , with correction for multiple comparisons , using Sleuth in R v3 . 5 . 1 ( 90 ) . ATAC - seq analysis ATAC - seq was performed according to the protocol detailed by Buenrostro and colleagues ( 92 ) . UCSC Genome Browser ( https : / / genome . ucsc . edu / ) was used for data visualization . HOMER was used to analyze known transcription factor motif enrichment ( http : / / homer . ucsd . edu / homer / ) . Paired - end sequencing was performed with NextSeq 500 with paired - end reads of 38 base pairs . Illumina fastq files were downloaded from Illumina Basespace , and adapters were removed with Cutadapt ( https : / / journal . embnet . org / index . php / embnetjournal / article / view / 200 ) using the option “ - a CTGTCTCT - TATA - A CTGTCTCTTATA - m 23 . ” Reads were then mapped to the mm9 mouse genome with Bowtie2 using the option “ - k 10 - X 1000 – end - to - end – very - sensitive” ( 93 ) . Sam files were converted to Bam files , and read duplicates were removed using Picard ( https : / / broadinstitute . github . io / picard / ) .

Bam files were converted to Bed files also using BEDTools , and macs2 ( https : / / genomebiology . biomedcentral . com / articles / 10 . 1186 / gb - 2008 - 9 - 9 - r137 ) was used to call peaks using the converted bed file . Macs2 call - peak options used were “ - f BED - g mm - q 0 . 05 - - nomodel - - shift - 75 - - extsize 150 - - keep - dup all . ” To count the number of reads in each peak , featureCounts ( https : / / academic . oup . com / bioinformatics / article / 30 / 7 / 923 / 232889 ) was used . Read counts were normalized using the trimmed mean of M - values method in EdgeR Meizlish et al . , Sci . Adv . 10 , eadk6906 ( 2024 ) 13 March 2024 S c i e n c e A d vAn c eS | R eSeA R c h AR t i c l e 15 of 17 ( https : / / bioconductor . org / packages / release / bioc / html / edgeR . html ) , and differences of 1 . 5 - fold or greater were analyzed as discussed in the text . Animals All use of animals was performed in accordance with institutional regulations after protocol review and approval by Yale University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . Bleomycin - induced lung injury C57BL / 6 mice of 8 to 10 weeks of age were injected oropharyngeally with 50 μ l of PBS or bleomycin ( 1 U / ml ; Teva ) after being anesthe - tized with 1 , 2 - propanediol and isoflurane at a ratio of 7 : 3 . On day 3 , 6 , 9 , or 12 , mice were euthanized and transcardially perfused with hepa - rin ( 60 μ g / ml ) in PBS . For histology analysis , lung was fixed and in - flated by intratracheal injection with 10 % PFA . Whole lung was collected and further fixed in 10 % PFA for 6 hours at 4°C . The left superior lobe was subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining and Masson’s trichrome staining , which were performed by Yale Patholo - gy Tissue Services . The right superior lobe was further treated with 30 % sucrose for 24 hours and embedded in optimum cutting tem - perature compound ( VWR ) . Frozen sections were prepared and stained as described below . For mRNA expression analysis , all lung lobes were homogenized in 1 ml of RNA - Bee , the supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 12 , 700 rpm for 3 min , and RNA isola - tion and qRT - PCR analysis were performed . For flow cytometry anal - ysis , the whole lung was minced with a sharp razor blade and digested with collagenase type IV ( 2 mg / ml ; Worthington , LS004189 ) and de - oxyribonuclease II ( 4 μ g / ml ; Worthington , LS002425 ) at 37°C with 180 rpm of rotation for 30 min . Cells were passed through a 70 - μ m cell strainer , and remaining tissue pieces were mashed with a plunger . Following red blood cell lysis by ACK lysing buffer ( Lonza ) , single - cell suspension was collected and stained as described above . Isotype control antibodies for gating Fizz1 - and Arg1 - positive cells were used at each time point for each sample . Immunostaining of lung tissue Frozen lung tissues were cut at 60 μ m in thickness with a cryostat . After washing with PBS , sections were incubated with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 in PBS ( wash buffer ) for 30 min for permeabilization and then with 5 % normal goat serum ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) in wash buffer ( blocking buffer ) . Endogenous biotin was blocked with Avidin / Biotin Blocking Kit ( Vector Laboratories ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Following the wash with wash buffer , tissues were reacted with rabbit anti – collagen I antibody ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , PA5 - 95137 ) at 1 : 200 and biotinylated anti - F4 / 80 antibody ( clone BM8 , eBioscience , 13 - 4801 - 85 ) at 1 : 200 in block - ing buffer overnight at 4°C .
