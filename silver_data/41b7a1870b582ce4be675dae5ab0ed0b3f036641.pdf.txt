Kauffman The Origins of Order : Self - Organization and Selection in Evolution Stuart A . Kauffman Stuart Kauffman here presents a brilliant new paradigm for evolutionary biology , one that extends the basic concepts of Darwinian evolution to accommodate recent findings and perspectives from the fields of biology , physics , chemistry and mathematics . The book drives to the heart of the exciting debate on the origins of life and maintenance of order in complex biological systems . It focuses on the concept of self - organization : the spontaneous emergence of order that is widely observed throughout nature Kauffman argues that self - organization plays an important role in the Darwinian process of natural selection . Yet until now no systematic effort has been made to incorporate the concept of self - organization into evolutionary theory . The construction requirements which permit complex systems to adapt are poorly understood , as is the extent to which selection itself can yield systems able to adapt more successfully . This book explores these themes . It shows how complex systems , contrary to expectations , can spontaneously exhibit stunning degrees of order , and how this order , in turn , is essential for understanding the emergence and development of life on Earth . Topics include the new biotechnology of applied molecular evolution , with its important implications for developing new drugs and vaccines ; the balance between order and chaos observed in many naturally occurring systems ; new insights concerning the predictive power of statistical mechanics in biology ; and other major issues . Indeed , the approaches investigated here may prove to be the new center around which biological science itself will evolve . The work is written for all those interested in the cutting edge of research in the life sciences .
