These domains maintain their identity until they undergo ﬁssion to trafﬁc cargo . It is not fully understood how segrega - tion of cargo or Rab proteins is maintained along the continuous endosomal membrane or what machin - ery is required for ﬁssion . Endosomes form contact sites with the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) that are maintained during trafﬁcking . Here , we show that stable contacts form between the ER and endosome at constricted sorting domains , and free diffusion of cargo is limited at these positions . We demonstrate that the site of constriction and ﬁssion for early and late endosomes is spatially and temporally linked to contact sites with the ER . Lastly , we show that altering ER structure and dynamics reduces the efﬁ - ciency of endosome ﬁssion . Together , these data reveal a surprising role for ER contact in deﬁning the timing and position of endosome ﬁssion . INTRODUCTION The endocytic pathway is used to internalize components pre - sent on the plasma membrane and in the extracellular ﬂuid . After internalization , endocytosed cargo is sorted at multiple steps during trafﬁcking . Cargo destined for degradation at the lyso - some is sorted away from both recycled cargo destined for the plasma membrane and cargo trafﬁcked to the Golgi . The sorting of these cargoes must occur prior to endosome ﬁssion , and multiple machineries and mechanisms have been identiﬁed that contribute to this process ( Hanyaloglu and von Zastrow , 2008 ; Maxﬁeld and McGraw , 2004 ; Seaman , 2008 ) . Microtu - bules and their motor proteins , branched actin networks gener - ated by the Arp2 / 3 activator WASH , the retromer , and structural membrane shaping proteins such as sorting nexins ( SNX ) , have all been implicated in endosome structure and cargo sorting ( Gautreau et al . , 2014 ; Hunt et al . , 2013 ; Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ) . However , it is not known what regulates the timing and position of membrane ﬁssion to separate the sorted compartments . Functional contact sites have been observed between the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and endosomes ( Alpy et al . , 2013 ; Eden et al . , 2010 ; Rocha et al . , 2009 ) . Measurements by electron microscopy and tomography have revealed that contact sites between the ER network and individual endosomes exist at mul - tiple discrete positions around the endosome , which additively covers only (cid:1) 5 % of the endosome surface area ( Alpy et al . , 2013 ; Friedman et al . , 2013 ) . Despite the abundance and discrete nature of these contacts , they appear to be tightly coupled because the two organelles maintain contact even as they are trafﬁcked on the microtubule network ( Friedman et al . , 2013 ; Zajac et al . , 2013 ) . Endosomes become bound to the ER early in their biogenesis and this association increases with maturation : we found > 99 % of late endosomes are tightly asso - ciated with the ER as they trafﬁc , in contrast to (cid:1) 50 % of early endosomes ( Friedman et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , ER contact could regulate the biogenesis of endosomes or become targeted to endosomes following a maturation step . Once established , ER contact with endosomes is often maintained despite trafﬁcking , and this suggests important functions occur at the interface . Two functions have been demonstrated to occur at the ER - en - dosome interface ( van der Kant and Neefjes , 2014 ) . Interactions between ( VAMP ) - associated protein A ( VAP - A ) on the ER and the endosome localized partners are thought to regulate cholesterol sensing and lipid transfer . For example , the endosomal protein ORP1L interacts with VAP - A under low cholesterol conditions that could allow for cholesterol exchange , thereby acting as a sensor ( Rocha et al . , 2009 ) . ER - endosome contact also occurs via the ER - localized phosphatase , PTP1B , which interacts with epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , dephosphorylating it to promote incorporation into intraluminal vesicles , a necessary step for EGFR degradation by the lysosome ( Eden et al . , 2010 ) . Several recent papers also suggest that late endosomes may take up Ca 2 + from ER stores during their maturation process , however , it remains to be determined whether Ca 2 + is directly transferred at the interface ( Kilpatrick et al . , 2013 ; Lo´pez - San - jurjo et al . , 2013 ; Morgan et al . , 2013 ) . The ER also forms contacts with several other organelles ( Helle et al . , 2013 ) , and its role at these various sites may be anal - ogous . At mitochondria and the plasma membrane , the ER pro - vides Ca 2 + in different functional contexts ( Elbaz and Schuldiner , 2011 ) . Emerging evidence also shows lipids are modiﬁed or transferred at the ER interface ( Stefan et al . , 2013 ; Toulmay and Prinz , 2011 ) . Recently , we discovered that ER tubules circumscribe mitochondrial constrictions and deﬁne the position of mitochondrial ﬁssion ( Friedman et al . , 2011 ) . We predicted that mechanisms of membrane ﬁssion may also be conserved between various organelles . Here , we hypothesized and tested Cell 159 , 1027 – 1041 , November 20 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 1027 t = 0s t = 15s t = 10s t = 5s 4ba R - P F G β 16 c e S - P F B F G E - 746 B F P - S e c 61 β 647 - E G F G F P - R ab4 647 - E G F G F P - R ab4 m C h - R ab5 647 - EGF / GFP - Rab4 / BFP - Sec61 β mCh - Rab5 / GFP - Rab4 647 - Tf / GFP - Rab4 / BFP - Sec61 β mCh - Rab5 / GFP - Rab4 G F P - R ab4 m C h - R ab5 4ba R - P F G β 16 c e S - P F B f T - 746 B F P - S e c 61 β 647 - T f t = 0s t = 50s t = 45s t = 35s G F P - R ab4 647 - T f A B E D C F Vacuole Bud ER ER Vacuole Bud Pre - Fission ( t = 10s ) Post - Fission ( t = 15s ) 0 50 100 150 200 0 10 20 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 15 30 R e l a t i v e F l uo r e sc en c e I n t en s i t y Distance ( Linear Pixels ) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 7 . 5 15 Pre - ER ( t = 0s ) Vacuole Bud 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 7 . 5 15 Vacuole Bud ER 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 10 20 R e l a t i v e F l uo r e sc en c e I n t e n s i t y Distance ( Linear Pixels ) Pre - Fission ( t = 35s ) Post - Fission ( t = 45s ) Vacuole Bud ER 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 7 . 5 15 Pre - ER ( t = 0s ) Vacuole Bud R ab4 E R E G F R ab5 R ab4 E R T f R ab5 Figure 1 .

To test this , we visualized Rab partitioning , cargo sorting , and endosome ﬁssion relative to the ER network in live Cos - 7 cells . RESULTS Dynamic ER Tubules Make Contact with Early Endosome Fission Sites To visualize early endosome sorting and ﬁssion events relative to the ER , cells were cotransfected with GFP - Rab4 , mCh - Rab5 , and with the general ER marker BFP - Sec61 b and were imaged by live confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Figures 1A and 1D ) . Rab4 localizes to both the vacuolar and budding compartment of the early endosome ( So¨nnichsen et al . , 2000 ) , while Rab5 is exclusively localized to the vacuolar compartment ( So ¨ nnichsen et al . , 2000 ; Trischler et al . , 1999 ) . Partitioning of cargo also oc - curs within the early endosome sorting domains . To ensure that the endosomes we visualized were functional , cells were pulse - labeled with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) ( Figures 1A – 1C ) or transferrin ( Tf ) ( Figures 1D – 1F ) cargo conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 . The Rab4 and Rab5 endosomes contain labeled cargo , and their localization and morphology is consistent with previous reports ( So¨nnichsen et al . , 2000 ; Trischler et al . , 1999 ) ( Figures 1A and 1D ) . Upon ﬁssion , a smaller Rab4 + compartment buds off of a larger Rab4 + / Rab5 + vacuolar compartment ( Figures 1B and E , top panels ; Movies S1 and S2 available online ) . The ﬂuorescent EGF is conﬁned to the vacuolar Rab4 + / Rab5 + compartment and does not enter into the bud ( Figure 1B , panel row 3 , yellow arrow - head ; Movie S1 ) . In contrast , Tf was not conﬁned to a compart - ment and was found in the Rab4 + bud as well as the Rab4 + / Rab5 + compartment ( Figure 1E , panel row 3 , yellow arrowhead ; Movie S2 ) . Live cell imaging ( Figures 1B and 1E ) and the corre - sponding line - scan analysis ( Figures 1C and 1F ) reveals that in both examples , an ER tubule moves into position at the divide between the two preformed compartments just before ﬁssion occurs ( compare the position of the ER tubule relative to the two sorting compartments in the Pre - ER and Pre - Fission images and line - scans ) . These data reveal that ER tubules mark the po - sition of early endosome ﬁssion and that there is a temporal rela - tionship between ER recruitment and ﬁssion . ER Tubules Contact Sorting Domains on Early Endosomes It is difﬁcult to quantitate whether the ER marks all early endo - some ﬁssion events because early endosomes are small and ﬁssion is rapid , hindering our ability to capture instances of clear constriction followed by ﬁssion . Thus , we sought ways to slow ﬁssion and / or inhibit it at intermediate stages to better resolve the relationship between ER tubules and the position of early en - dosome constriction and ﬁssion . This was accomplished by treating cells with dynasore , a drug which has been shown to inhibit Dynamin - 1 , Dynamin - 2 , and Drp1 in vitro ( Kirchhausen et al . , 2008 ; Macia et al . , 2006 ) . As previously reported ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Mesaki et al . , 2011 ) , Cos - 7 cells treated with dyna - sore accumulate tubular early endosomes ( Figure 2A ) . This phenotype could be a consequence of dynamin inhibition or it could be due to off - target effects , which have been reported ( Park et al . , 2013 ) . However , our data demonstrate that dynasore treatment is a very useful tool to slow the process of endosome ﬁssion and image bona ﬁde ﬁssion intermediates at ER contact sites . Cells were cotransfected with markers of early endosomes ( mCh - Rab5 ) and the ER ( GFP - Sec61 b ) and were treated with dy - nasore just prior to imaging . Treatment led to the formation of elongated Rab5 + endosomes and did not alter the structure of the ER ( Figure 2A ) ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Mesaki et al . , 2011 ) . Like untreated endosomes , dynasore - induced tubular endo - somes contain both degraded and recycled cargo that partition as expected ( Figures S1A and S1B ) . To further test if tubular en - dosomes had features characteristic of native endosomes , we investigated whether they contained domains marked by the WASH complex ( Figure 2 ) . WASH is a multiprotein complex that activates Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin nucleation at sorting do - mains ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ; Harbour et al . , 2012 ; Jia et al . , 2010 ) , and this actin nucleation may participate in cargo sorting ( Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ) , or generate force to catalyze ﬁssion . To mark the complex , we tagged FAM21 , which has been shown to localize to early endo - somes , bind the retromer complex , and regulate recruitment of WASH to endosomal sorting domains ( Seaman et al . , 2013 ) . Cells were cotransfected with GFP - Rab5 , BFP - Sec61 b , and mCh - FAM21 . In dynasore - treated cells , FAM21 localized to patches and punctate structures along tubular endosomes ( Fig - ure 2B ) . Line - scan analysis demonstrated that FAM21 - labeled structures corresponded to positions where Rab5 ﬂuorescence was minimal , indicative of a constriction ( see arrows in Figure 2C and 2D ) . ER tubules also crossed over the positions of FAM21 - marked constrictions ( see arrows in Figure 2C and 2D ) . These data demonstrate that sorting domains localize to dynasore - induced elongated endosomes and ER tubule crossings are spatially linked to these domains . ER Tubules Contact Endosomes at a Barrier to Cargo Diffusion Our data suggest that dynasore treatment can stall ﬁssion at ER - marked endosome sorting domains , and line - scan analysis indi - cates endosomes are constricted at ER contact sites ( Figure 2D ) . To further establish the importance of the ER at stalled constric - tions , we reasoned a functional constriction has the potential to impede the diffusion of cargo . According to the bulk ﬂow hypoth - esis , membrane - bound cargo that is recycled to the plasma membrane , like transferrin receptor ( TfR ) , diffuses freely in the membrane ( Dunn et al . , 1989 ; Mayor et al . , 1993 ) . We designed photobleaching techniques to test whether a diffusion barrier ( E ) Zoom from ( D ) shows the relative localization of Rab4 , Rab5 , ER , and Tf as indicated over time . An ER tubule ( marked by blue arrow ) is again recruited to the divide between Rab4 compartments just before ﬁssion ( t = 35 s ) . An exiting Rab4 + / Tf + bud is marked by a yellow arrowhead .

Cells were cotransfected with an ER marker ( mCh - Sec61 b ) , an early endosomal marker ( BFP - Rab5 ) , and a mem - brane - bound cargo marker ( GFP - TfR ) . Next , cells were treated with dynasore to generate elongated endosomes . We photo - bleached GFP - TfR at one end of a tubular endosome and then visualized ﬂuorescence recovery from the unbleached direction ( see model Figure 2E ) . To conﬁrm tubular endosomes persist throughout this process , we covisualized unbleached BFP - Rab5 . Two examples of TfR ﬂuorescence recovery along the tubular endosome are shown in kymographs ( Figures 2F and 2H ) . In the example shown in Figure 2F , the GFP - TfR is photo - bleached as indicated ( in the yellow circle ) , and the ﬂuorescent signal recovers rapidly ( within 10 s ) up to a position marked by the yellow arrow . This position corresponds to a contact site with the tip of an ER tubule ( see merge with the ER on the right ) . Furthermore , line - scan analysis demonstrates that the endo - some constriction ( Rab5 ) and the diffusion barrier overlap with the ER contact site even as the endosome moves over time ( Fig - ure 2G , yellow arrows mark the diffusion barrier [ D . B . ] ; also see Movie S3 ) . In the example shown in Figure 2H , recovery is also rapid up to the position marked by a yellow arrow , which corre - sponds to a crossing ER tubule . As before , diffusion was limited at the position corresponding to a minimum in Rab5 ﬂuores - cence on the endosome , conﬁrming that it is indeed a constric - tion ( Figures 2H and 2I ) . This suggests that the bulk ﬂow of cargo between compartments is restricted at ER - marked constrictions prior to endosome ﬁssion . Fission of Tubular Early Endosomes Occurs at ER Contact Sites ER association with tubular endosome constrictions is strikingly reminiscent of contact sites between ER tubules and mitochon - drial constrictions that undergo ﬁssion ( Friedman et al . , 2011 ) . We therefore tested if ER - marked constrictions along tubular en - dosomes are stalled intermediates primed to undergo ﬁssion . Cells were cotransfected with mCh - Rab5 and GFP - Sec61 b then treated with dynasore to generate tubular endosomes . To capture ﬁssion , dynasore was inactivated with fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and cells were imaged live ( Figure 3A ) . As with native early endosomes , the ER contacted elongated endo - somes and deﬁned the position of constriction and ﬁssion ( Fig - ures 3B and 3C ) . We visualized 31 individual ﬁssion events ( in nine cells , Figure 3D ; Movie S4 ) . ER tubule crossings were pre - sent at 80 . 6 % of these ﬁssion events ( Figure 3D ) . The mean coverage of the ER network on the tubular endosomes analyzed was 22 . 36 % ( Figures 3E and 3F ) , which demonstrates that ER contact at the site of ﬁssion is not due to chance . Together , these data show that ER contact sites are spatially linked to the posi - tion of constriction and ﬁssion on early sorting endosomes . ER Recruitment Is Spatially and Temporally Linked to the Position of Late Endosome Fission The vast majority of late endosomes ( > 99 % ) are also tightly associated with the ER over time ( Friedman et al . , 2013 ) . We asked whether ER contact sites are also spatially linked to the position of late endosome ﬁssion . Cos - 7 cells were transfected with markers for late endosomes ( mCh - Rab7 ) and the ER ( GFP - Sec61 b ) and were imaged live by confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy . Exogenous mCh - Rab7 was expressed at levels similar to endogenous ( Figure S2A ) , and the morphology of labeled late endosomes matched previous reports ( Figures 4A and S2B ) ( Barbero et al . , 2002 ) . Cells were also pulse - labeled with EGF ( conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 ) to mark the internaliza - tion and segregation of cargo . We imaged the structure , dy - namics , and interactions between the endosomes and the ER over time at the periphery of the cell where both organelles are well resolved . A representative example of a late endosome that undergoes ﬁssion is shown in Figures 4B and S2C . Here , a small Rab7 + compartment buds off of a larger Rab7 + vacuolar compartment . As expected , EGF is retained in the vacuolar compartment during constriction and ﬁssion ( Figures 4B , and 4C ; Movie S5 ) . After merging the time - lapsed images of endo - some ﬁssion with the location of the tubular ER network , we could observe an ER tubule localized to nearly every ﬁssion site ( 96 . 5 % : n = 29 from 24 cells , Figure 4D ; see also Figure S2D ) . In the majority of these cases ( 93 % ) , the ER was positioned perpendicular to the site of ﬁssion . By line scan analysis , it be - comes clear that a dynamic ER tubule moves into place to cross over and ‘‘cup’’ the bud just before ﬁssion occurs ( compare Pre - ER to Pre - Fission scans ) ( Figure 4B and 4C ) . These data reveal that ER tubules are both spatially and temporally linked to the position of late endosome ﬁssion . Next , we aimed to generate tubular late endosomes to further resolve the position of ER contact relative to the site of ﬁssion . Consistent with previous reports ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ) , we could generate slightly elongated tubular Rab7 - labeled late endo - somes by efﬁciently depleting dynamin - 2 ( Dnm2 ) by siRNA treat - ment ( Figure 4H ) . Cells were also simultaneously cotransfected with mCh - Rab7 and GFP - Sec61 b . Prior to imaging , these cells were pulse - labeled with EGF ( conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 ) to determine whether elongated endosomes could functionally partition cargo . Live confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy revealed that elongated endosomes in Dnm2 - depleted cells were still able to uptake EGF and undergo ﬁssion while retaining EGF in the ( D ) Line - scan analysis of relative FI of the endosome shown in ( C ) conﬁrms that FAM21and ER colocalize with Rab5 - labeled endosome constrictions ( marked by corresponding blue and yellow arrows ) .

In every example recorded ( 100 % , n = 12 from eight cells ) , ER tubules crossed perpendicular to the site of late endosome ( LE ) ﬁssion ( Figure 4F ) . As before , a dynamic ER tubule slides into place just prior to the ﬁssion event ( compare white and blue arrows in two left panels ) . We measured the mean coverage of the ER network on tubular endosomes to be 21 . 24 % for the 12 events captured ( Figures 4I and 4J ) . Thus , the average probability of ER - marked ﬁssion due to chance ( 21 . 24 % ) is signiﬁcantly lower than the measured frequency ( 100 % ) of ER - marked endosome ﬁssion . ER Tubules Contact Cargo - Sorting Domains Prior to Fission Next , we aimed to mark endosomal sorting domains prior to ﬁssion and ask if this position also coincided with the position of ER recruitment . The retromer complex sorts cargo into a domain on the late endosome that will undergo ﬁssion and trafﬁc to the Golgi ( Arighi et al . , 2004 ; Seaman , 2004 ) . FAM21 binds and colocalizes with these retromer - mediated sorting domains ( De - rivery et al . , 2009 ; Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . We thus asked whether ER tubules colocalized with FAM21 - marked sorting do - mains on late endosomes . Cells were transfected with markers of ER ( BFP - Sec61 b ) , late endosomes ( GFP - Rab7 ) , and the WASH complex ( mCh - FAM21 ) . FAM21 effectively partitions to both punctate and tubular structures on Rab7 + late endosomes that are indicative of retromer sorting domains ( Figure 5A ) . We tracked 165 FAM21 structures discretely localized to budding late endosome sorting domains ( Figures 5B and 5C ; Movie S7 ) . Of these , 80 % of FAM21 domains colocalize with the site of ER tubule contact over time ( see example in Figure 5B ) . Thus , most but not all FAM21 - marked retromer domains track together with ER tubules , which suggests that the ER is recruited after the sorting domain has formed . We next observed whether the ER is present at FAM21 - marked sorting domains when endosomes are undergoing ﬁssion ( Figures 5D – 5F ; Movie S8 ) . The ER was localized to 97 % of FAM21 - marked ﬁssion events ( n = 36 from 31 cells , Fig - ure 5G ) . In the example shown , it is important to note that a dy - namic ER tubule becomes associated with a FAM21 - marked sorting domain just prior to constriction and ﬁssion ( Figure 5E , compare white and blue arrows at 15 and 20 s , respectively ; Movie S8 ) . The temporal recruitment of ER to the position of constriction / ﬁssion is also clear by line - scan analysis ( Figure 5F , see the peak in ER ﬂuorescence at Pre - Fission ) . Together , these data demonstrate that ER contact is not required for retromer sorting domain formation or FAM21 recruitment , but that ER contact sites are both spatially and temporally linked to the ﬁssion events at FAM21 - marked sorting domains . We have shown that ER tubules make contact with FAM21 - marked sorting domains prior to ﬁssion . We thus wondered if ER contact with endosomes requires nucleation of actin by the WASH complex . FAM21 binds to the retromer on endosomes ; it is the ﬁrst component of the WASH complex to be recruited , and does so independently of other WASH complex members ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . We could thus deplete WASH1 which will disrupt WASH complex assembly and actin nucleation ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ) and ask whether the ER is still recruited to FAM21 - marked sorting domains and if so whether ﬁssion still occurs . We efﬁciently depleted WASH1 by siRNA and captured 25 FAM21 - marked ﬁssion events where all but one localized to an ER contact site ( n = 25 from 21 cells , Figure S3 ) . This demon - strates that the ER is recruited to functional endosome ﬁssion sites independent of WASH complex assembly or WASH - medi - ated actin nucleation . We have shown several examples where a dynamic ER move - ment establishes contact with a sorting domain immediately prior to ﬁssion . ER tubule dynamics are frequent and occur on microtubules ( MTs ) ( Friedman et al . , 2010 ; Waterman - Storer and Salmon , 1998 ) . Thus , we probed the effect of MT depolymerization on ER - endosome contact . Previously , we have shown that endosomes will maintain contact with the ER following MT depolymerization ( Friedman et al . , 2013 ) . Here , we tested whether ER contacts would also maintain contact with endosome constrictions following MT depolymerization ( Figure S4 ) . We show several examples where MTs are depoly - merized but ER contact still localizes to endosome constriction sites . We conclude that MT - dependent ER dynamics may be necessary to initiate contact between ER tubules and the constriction site . However , once formed , MTs do not appear necessary to maintain contact . ER Is Recruited to the Endosome Immediately Prior to Fission We show that tubular sorting domains can be observed prior to ER contact and ﬁssion . Often ER tubules ‘‘attack’’ the site of the preformed sorting domain resulting in ﬁssion ( Figures 6A and 6B ) . In the two complimentary examples shown , ﬁssion is observed within 10 s of contact formation ( Figure 6A and 6B ) . Many mechanisms have been identiﬁed to form the budding domain and sort cargoes ( Figure 6C ) . Microtubule motors have been implicated in sorting and trafﬁcking cargoes ( Hunt et al . , 2013 ) . Sorting nexins can drive the formation of budding tubules and stabilize them via curvature sensing BAR domains ( Cullen , 2008 ) . The retromer complex interacts with the sorting nexins and is involved in sorting of cargoes ( Pfeffer , 2009 ; Sea - man et al . , 2013 ) . FAM21 binds the retromer and is responsible for recruitment of remaining WASH complex components ( Go - mez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . The WASH complex stimulates Arp2 / 3 at endosomal sorting domains thereby activating actin polymerization ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ) . The presence of actin patches can also help to segregate select cargoes into the bud ( Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ) . The role of these multiple factors is to generate sorting domains to trafﬁc cargo . Here , we show that following sorting , the ER establishes contact with the endosome at sites that are spatially and temporally linked to endosome ﬁssion . Disruption of ER Dynamics and Shape Affects the Rate of Endosome Fission Our data support the following order of events : the budding sort - ing domain forms , ER tubule contact is established at the inter - face between the endosome and the bud , and then (cid:1) 5 – 10 s later ﬁssion occurs at this contact site ( Figures 6A and 6B ) . Consistent with this model , we show several compelling examples where a dynamic ER tubule ‘‘attacks’’ the future ﬁssion site . Thus , our Cell 159 , 1027 – 1041 , November 20 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 1033 F G E - 746 7ba R - h C m β 16 c e S - P F G 647 - E G F m C h - R ab7 647 - E G F G F P - S e c 61 β t = 20s t = 40s t = 35s t = 25s t = 0s A B ER Localization to sites of Cargo Segregation and LE Fission 0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % 100 % n = 29 At Crossing ( 93 % ) Adjacent ( 3 . 5 % ) No ER ( 3 . 5 % ) D t = 0s t = 50s t = 45s t = 40s F G E - 746 7ba R - h C m β 16 c e S - P F G 647 - E G F m C h - R ab7 647 - E G F G F P - S e c 61 β t = 55s E F ER Localization to sites of LE Fission in Dnm2 KD At Crossing ( 100 % ) Adjacent ( 0 % ) No ER ( 0 % ) 0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % 100 % n = 12 G D n m 2 C on t r o l siRNA IB : Dnm2 GAPDH H m C h - R ab7 647 - E G F m C h - R ab7 647 - E G F G F P - S e c 61 β m C h - R ab7 647 - E G F m C h - R ab7 647 - E G F G F P - S e c 61 β Dnm2 siRNA 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Vacuole Bud Vacuole Bud ER Vacuole Bud Pre - Fission ( t = 35s ) Post - Fission ( t = 40s ) Pre - ER ( t = 0s ) R e l a t i v e F l uo r e sc en c e I n t en s i t y 0 10 20 0 15 30 0 30 60 Distance ( Linear Pixels ) R ab7 E R E G F C M e r ge Rab7 Sec61 β 30 . 89 % Frequency of LE fission at ER crossings Observed Predicted if due to chance n = 12 12 ( 100 % ) 2 . 5 ( 21 . 24 % ) * * * I J I m ag e s T h r e s ho l d ( legend on next page ) 1034 Cell 159 , 1027 – 1041 , November 20 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . prediction was that altering the shape and dynamics of the pe - ripheral ER tubules would lead to a reduction in the frequency of late endosome ﬁssion . We chose to disrupt ER shape and dy - namics by overexpressing human Reticulon 4a ( Rtn4a ) , which has previously been shown to generate highly elongated and un - branched ER tubules ( Shibata et al . , 2008 ; Voeltz et al . , 2006 ) . Elongated tubules are coated with immobilized Rtn4a oligomers that can exclude other ER luminal and membrane proteins from the peripheral ER ( Shibata et al . , 2008 ; Voeltz et al . , 2006 ; Zurek et al . , 2011 ) . Cells were cotransfected with the general luminal ER marker BFP - KDEL , mCh - Rab7 to visualize endosome ﬁssion , and with or without high levels of Rtn4a - GFP . Compared to control , the Rtn4a - GFP cells had an altered ER morphology . As ex - pected , the peripheral ER tubules were highly elongated , un - branched , and luminal BFP - KDEL was mostly excluded from these elongated Rtn4a - GFP tubules ( Figure 7A , compare Rtn4a - labeled top panels to control bottom panels ) . ER tubules were also signiﬁcantly less dynamic with Rtn4a overexpression . This was measured quantitatively for all cells analyzed using the Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient of overlaid 5 m m square boxes from two frames taken 60 s apart ( Figures 7B and 7C ) ( French et al . , 2008 ) . By this measurement , the time - lapse images of the ER in Rtn4a - GFP expressing cells were more colocalized over time because the peripheral ER moved less , thus resulting in a higher Pearson’s correlation ( control , n = 22 ; Rtn4a , n = 20 ) . We tested whether the change in ER morphology caused by overexpressing Rtn4a impacted endosome ﬁssion . We re - corded 2 min movies of hundreds of individual late endosomes . For each endosome , we determined whether it formed a budding domain during the course of the movie . For each endo - somal bud observed , we measured the size of the endosome , the maximum bud length , and whether it underwent ﬁssion ( con - trol , n = 257 ; Rtn4a , n = 257 ) . We found that altering ER shape did not signiﬁcantly affect endosome size or bud length ( Figures 7D and 7E ) . However , we found that the number of buds that un - derwent ﬁssion was signiﬁcantly reduced with Rtn4a overex - pression ( Figure 7F ) . Thus , when ER membrane composition , shape , and dynamics are altered , the process of endosome ﬁssion is defective . DISCUSSION We have shown here that ER tubules form stable contact sites with sorting domains on early and late endosomes and that ER contact is a deﬁning feature of endosome ﬁssion . These results are strikingly analogous to previous data showing that ER contact sites deﬁne the position of mitochondrial constriction and division ( Friedman et al . , 2011 ) . Together , these reports demonstrate that the ER has an important and nontraditional roleinthecell : toregulatethedynamicsandbiogenesisofatleast two unique cytoplasmic organelles . How could an ER contact site regulate the constriction and / or ﬁssion of another organelle ? We favor three possibilities . First , contact sites could provide a platform for the recruitment of necessary factors from each organelle that are required to drive ﬁssion . Second , because the ER is the site of synthesis for most phospholipids , it is possible that direct translocation of lipids from theER into the en - dosomal membrane at contact sites generates a region of high lipid membrane curvature that would promote ﬁssion . The ER is also home to lipid modifying enzymes that may transform lipids on the endosomal membrane to similarly drive localized changes in membrane curvature . A third favored model is that ER stores could provide high local concentrations of Ca 2 + required to acti - vate a Ca 2 + - dependent activity on the endosome and regulate ﬁssion . Indeed , these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and may all contribute to organelle ﬁssion at contact sites . From an evolutionary point of view , one might think the ability of the ER to divide neighboring organelles would be advanta - geous for expedited ER dynamics within the cell or for whole - cell rearrangements that occur during mitosis . Both are daunting tasks considering the density of the organelles in the intracellular environment . However , the position of the ER at the site of ﬁssion appears to be purposeful for ﬁssion of endosomes as well as for mitochondria . We have observed that the ER settles to form sta - ble contact sites with the divide between sorting compartments prior to ﬁssion . Likewise , on mitochondria , the ER is also pur - posefully localized to the position of nucleoid segregation prior to mitochondrial division ( Murley et al . , 2013 ) . How ER tubules bind to ﬁssion sites on endosomes ( and even on mitochondria ) is not known and remains an open and Figure 4 .

Although several partners have been identiﬁed that can bridge the apposing membranes , including PTP1B - EGFR , VAP - A - ORP1L , and STARD3 - ORP1L ( Alpy et al . , 2013 ; Eden et al . , 2010 ; Rocha et al . , 2009 ) , none have been shown to be required for maintenance of contact . Thus , these could all be independent tethers for independent functions or these complexes could function at sites that are tethered by yet unidentiﬁed factors . There are likely multiple points of contact between the ER and endosomes that could co - ordinate functions . For example , previous immunoelectron mi - croscopy has also shown colocalization of EGFR and PTP1B at the ER - endosome interface ( Eden et al . , 2010 ; Haj et al . , 2002 ) . By live confocal microscopy , we also ﬁnd that EGF within endosomes frequently tracks with the position of ER contact ( Figure S5A ) . Therefore , we tested if ER - marked endosome ﬁssion occurs at the same contact sites as EGF clustering . We found that EGF puncta localized to less than half of the ER - marked ﬁssion events ( Figure S5B ) . These data demonstrate that multiple functional and structural contact sites exist be - tween the ER and endosomes to coordinate different functions during cargo sorting and ﬁssion . The machinery at ER - marked endosome ﬁssion sites could be especially difﬁcult to identify because , in many examples , these contacts are established immediately prior to the ﬁssion event and thus are likely to be very transient . The identiﬁcation of this transient machinery will be a next major goal .

Whole cell lysates of Cos - 7 cells were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer , boiled for 10 min , separated by SDS - PAGE , and transferred to a PVDF membrane . Primary antibody concentrations were used as follows : Rab7 ( Cell Signaling 99367S ) 1 : 1 , 000 ; Dynamin - 2 ( Abcam ab3457 ) 1 : 15 , 000 ; WASH1 ( gift from D .

Band density was estimated using ImageJ ( NIH ) Gel Analyzer . Confocal Microscopy Live - cell imaging was performed with an inverted ﬂuorescence microscope ( TE2000 - U ; Nikon ) equipped with an electron - multiplying charge - coupled device ( CCD ) camera ( Cascade II ; Photometrics ) and a Yokogawa spinning - disk confocal system ( CSU - Xm2 ; Nikon ) . Images were taken with a 100 3 nu - merical aperture 1 . 4 oil objective ( Nikon ) . While imaging , live cells were kept at 37 (cid:3) C in a live - cell incubation chamber ( Pathology Devices ) . Images were ac - quired withMetaMorph 7 . 0 ( MDS Analytical Technologies ) , analyzed , merged , and contrasted using ImageJ , as well as contrasted and converted to 400 dpi using Photoshop ( Adobe ) . Scale bars were generated using ImageJ . Supple - mental videos were generated using ImageJ . Endosome Fission and ER Coverage Analysis Cos - 7 cells expressing markers for ER and endosomes were visualized live by confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy every 5 s for 2 min in a single focal plane . Fission events were counted if they were in regions of the cell with resolvable ER tubules . Association of ER tubules was classiﬁed as adjacent , crossing , or not associated . Line - scans were performed using ImageJ by drawing a line the width of the budding compartment along the length of the entire endosome . Fission of dynasore - induced elongated endosomes ( Figures 3B – 3D ) and Dynamin - 2 siRNA - induced elongated endosomes ( Fig - ures 4E – 4G ) was analyzed if ER coverage was measured as < 35 % of the total endosome area . To predict the frequency of ER at the site of ﬁssion if ﬁssion could occur at any ER crossing along the endosome , we measured the area of crossing ER tubules versus total endosome area from the image immediately preceding endosome ﬁssion for all events . The area was measured using the adaptive threshold plugin for ImageJ ( created by Qingzong Tseng ) which converts the 8 - bit images to binary form deﬁning the ER or endosome structure . We found the percent of endosome area covered by crossing ER tubules by comparing the number of pixels positive for ER signal to total number of pixels from the endosome area . We only selected the regions of ER that crossed the elongated endosome , omitting any ER tubules that ran parallel to the endosome .

( legend continued on next page ) 1038 Cell 159 , 1027 – 1041 , November 20 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . washed two times in 37 (cid:3) C Opti - MEM and imaged for less than 30 min to localize transferrin or EGF to early endosomes or after 30 min to localize EGF to late endosomes . Dynasore Treatment and Imaging Cells were passaged and transfected as described above . Cells were then washedtwotimesandincubatedinserum - free , antibiotic - freeDMEMcontain - ing 80 – 160 m M dynasore ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 30 min prior to imaging . After locating cells containing tubular endosomes by confocal microscopy , 10 % FBS was added to inactivate dynasore thereby preventing adverse effects and restoring ﬁssion . To label cargo in dynasore - treated cells , cells were simultaneously incu - bated with either 1 m g / ml EGF conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 ( Invitrogen ) or 50 m g / ml transferrin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 ( Invitrogen ) for the duration of the dynasore incubation saturating the endosomes with cargo . Following the incubation , cells were washed two times with serum - free , antibiotic - free DMEM to remove excess cargo and the media was replaced with serum - free , antibiotic - free DMEM containing 80 – 160 m M dynasore for imaging . Diffusion Barrier Identiﬁcation by Photobleaching Cos - 7 cells were transfected with GFP - TfR , BFP - Rab5 , and mCh - Sec61 b as described above . Cells were dynasore - treated as described above . Once a cell containing tubular endosomes was identiﬁed , a circular region of interest 30pixelsindiameterwascreatedusingMetaMorph7 . 0 . UsingtheMosaicDig - ital Diaphragm System for Nikon TE2000 Microscope ( Photonic Instruments ) , an image was captured prebleach and the region of interest was photo - bleached for 2 s ( Uniblitz VCM - D1 shutter , Vincent Associates ) using an Argon laser with a wavelength of 450 – 515 nm ( National Laser ) . An image was taken postbleach followed by a 1 min movie of all expressed channels with 5 s intervals . ( B ) A Cos - 7 cell expressing mCh - Rab7 and GFP - Sec61 b was pulse - labeled with EGF conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 . The ER tubule contacts the endosome , ﬁssion occurs at the point of contact , the budding domain leaves , maintaining ER contact . ( C ) The many factors implicated in endosome sorting and ﬁssion are indicated in the model pre - and post - ER recruitment . Following sorting , the ER establishes contact with the endosome at sites that are spatially and temporally linked to endosome ﬁssion . See also Figure S5 .

We identiﬁed constric - tions marked by ER tubule crossings by drawing a line the width of the tubular endosome being analyzed and measuring the mean ﬂuorescence intensity along the length of the tubular endosome . Measuring Dynamic ER Movements Live Cos - 7 cells were imaged every 5s for 2 min . Raw images taken 60 s apart wereconvertedto8bitandoverlaidusingImageJ . TheaveragePearson’scor - relation coefﬁcient was determined for three peripheral 5 m m boxes for each cell using the PSC Colocalization plugin for ImageJ ( French et al . , 2008 ) . A higher degree of colocalization ( Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient closer to 1 . 0 ) between the images over time is indicative of a less dynamic ER . Nocodazole Treatment and Imaging Dynamin - 2 was depleted as described above to enrich for elongated endo - somes . Cells were passaged and transfected as described above . Cells were then washed and incubated in 37 (cid:3) C Opti - MEM prior to imaging . After locating cells containing elongated endosomes by confocal microscopy , a z stack was acquired . Then , 5 m M nocodazole ( Acros Organics ) was added for at least 15 min or until the majority of microtubules had depolymerized . A z stack was taken posttreatment to observe the position of the ER relative to endosome constrictions .
