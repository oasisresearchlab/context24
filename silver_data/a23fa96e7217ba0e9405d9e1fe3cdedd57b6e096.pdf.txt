Applications include machine translation ( MT ) , summarization , generation , question answering ( QA ) , short answer grading , se - mantic search , dialog and conversational systems . The STS shared task is a venue for assessing the current state - of - the - art . The 2017 task focuses on multilingual and cross - lingual pairs with one sub - track ex - ploring MT quality estimation ( MTQE ) data . The task obtained strong participa - tion from 31 teams , with 17 participating in all language tracks . We summarize per - formance and review a selection of well performing methods . Analysis highlights common errors , providing insight into the limitations of existing models . To support ongoing work on semantic representations , the STS Benchmark is introduced as a new shared training and evaluation set carefully selected from the corpus of English STS shared task data ( 2012 - 2017 ) . 1 Introduction Semantic Textual Similarity ( STS ) assesses the degree to which two sentences are semantically equivalent to each other . The STS task is moti - vated by the observation that accurately modeling the meaning similarity of sentences is a founda - tional language understanding problem relevant to numerous applications including : machine trans - lation ( MT ) , summarization , generation , question answering ( QA ) , short answer grading , semantic search , dialog and conversational systems . STS en - ables the evaluation of techniques from a diverse set of domains against a shared interpretable perfor - mance criteria . Semantic inference tasks related to STS include textual entailment ( Bentivogli et al . , 2016 ; Bowman et al . , 2015 ; Dagan et al . , 2010 ) , semantic relatedness ( Bentivogli et al . , 2016 ) and paraphrase detection ( Xu et al . , 2015 ; Ganitkevitch et al . , 2013 ; Dolan et al . , 2004 ) . STS differs from both textual entailment and paraphrase detection in that it captures gradations of meaning overlap rather than making binary classiﬁcations of par - ticular relationships . While semantic relatedness expresses a graded semantic relationship as well , it is non - speciﬁc about the nature of the relationship with contradictory material still being a candidate for a high score ( e . g . , “night” and “day” are highly related but not particularly similar ) . To encourage and support research in this area , the STS shared task has been held annually since 2012 , providing a venue for evaluation of state - of - the - art algorithms and models ( Agirre et al . , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , 2016 ) . During this time , di - verse similarity methods and data sets 1 have been explored . Early methods focused on lexical se - mantics , surface form matching and basic syntac - tic similarity ( B¨ar et al . , 2012 ; ˇSari´c et al . , 2012a ; Jimenez et al . , 2012a ) . During subsequent evalua - tions , strong new similarity signals emerged , such as Sultan et al . ( 2015 ) ’s alignment based method . More recently , deep learning became competitive with top performing feature engineered systems ( He et al . , 2016 ) . The best performance tends to be obtained by ensembling feature engineered and deep learning models ( Rychalska et al . , 2016 ) . Signiﬁcant research effort has focused on STS over English sentence pairs . 2 English STS is a 1 i . a . , news headlines , video and image descriptions , glosses from lexical resources including WordNet ( Miller , 1995 ; Fellbaum , 1998 ) , FrameNet ( Baker et al . , 1998 ) , OntoNotes ( Hovy et al . , 2006 ) , web discussion fora , plagia - rism , MT post - editing and Q & A data sets . Data sets are sum - marized on : http : / / ixa2 . si . ehu . es / stswiki . 2 The 2012 and 2013 STS tasks were English only . The 2014 and 2015 task included a Spanish track and 2016 had a well - studied problem , with state - of - the - art systems often achieving 70 to 80 % correlation with human judgment . To promote progress in other languages , the 2017 task emphasizes performance on Arabic and Spanish as well as cross - lingual pairings of English with material in Arabic , Spanish and Turk - ish . The primary evaluation criteria combines per - formance on all of the different language condi - tions except English - Turkish , which was run as a surprise language track . Even with this departure from prior years , the task attracted 31 teams pro - ducing 84 submissions . STS shared task data sets have been used exten - sively for research on sentence level similarity and semantic representations ( i . a . , Arora et al . ( 2017 ) ; Conneau et al . ( 2017 ) ; Mu et al . ( 2017 ) ; Pagliardini et al . ( 2017 ) ; Wieting and Gimpel ( 2017 ) ; He and Lin ( 2016 ) ; Hill et al . ( 2016 ) ; Kenter et al . ( 2016 ) ; Lau and Baldwin ( 2016 ) ; Wieting et al . ( 2016a , b ) ; He et al . ( 2015 ) ; Pham et al . ( 2015 ) ) . To encourage the use of a common evaluation set for assessing new methods , we present the STS Benchmark , a publicly available selection of data from English STS shared tasks ( 2012 - 2017 ) . 2 Task Overview STS is the assessment of pairs of sentences accord - ing to their degree of semantic similarity . The task involves producing real - valued similarity scores for sentence pairs . Performance is measured by the Pearson correlation of machine scores with human judgments . The ordinal scale in Table 1 guides human annotation , ranging from 0 for no meaning overlap to 5 for meaning equivalence . Intermediate values reﬂect interpretable levels of partial overlap in meaning . The annotation scale is designed to be accessible by reasonable human judges with - out any formal expertise in linguistics . Using rea - sonable human interpretations of natural language semantics was popularized by the related textual entailment task ( Dagan et al . , 2010 ) . The result - ing annotations reﬂect both pragmatic and world knowledge and are more interpretable and useful within downstream systems . 3 Evaluation Data The Stanford Natural Language Inference ( SNLI ) corpus ( Bowman et al . , 2015 ) is the primary evalu - ation data source with the exception that one of the pilot track on cross - lingual Spanish - English STS . The English tracks attracted the most participation and have the largest use of the evaluation data in ongoing research . 5 The two sentences are completely equivalent , as they mean the same thing . The bird is bathing in the sink . Birdie is washing itself in the water basin . 4 The two sentences are mostly equivalent , but some unimportant details differ . Two boys on a couch are playing video games . Two boys are playing a video game . 3 The two sentences are roughly equivalent , but some important information differs / missing . John said he is considered a witness but not a suspect . “He is not a suspect anymore . ” John said . 2 The two sentences are not equivalent , but share some details . They ﬂew out of the nest in groups . They ﬂew into the nest together . 1 The two sentences are not equivalent , but are on the same topic . The woman is playing the violin . The young lady enjoys listening to the guitar . 0 The two sentences are completely dissimilar . The black dog is running through the snow . A race car driver is driving his car through the mud . Table 1 : Similarity scores with explanations and English examples from Agirre et al . ( 2013 ) . cross - lingual tracks explores data from the WMT 2014 quality estimation task ( Bojar et al . , 2014 ) . 3 Sentences pairs in SNLI derive from Flickr30k image captions ( Young et al . , 2014 ) and are labeled with the entailment relations : entailment , neutral , and contradiction . Drawing from SNLI allows STS models to be evaluated on the type of data used to assess textual entailment methods . However , since entailment strongly cues for semantic relatedness ( Marelli et al . , 2014 ) , we construct our own sen - tence pairings to deter gold entailment labels from informing evaluation set STS scores . Track 4b investigates the relationship between STS and MT quality estimation by providing STS labels for WMT quality estimation data . The data includes Spanish translations of English sentences from a variety of methods including RBMT , SMT , hybrid - MT and human translation . Translations are annotated with the time required for human cor - rection by post - editing and Human - targeted Trans - lation Error Rate ( HTER ) ( Snover et al . , 2006 ) . 4 Participants are not allowed to use the gold quality estimation annotations to inform STS scores . 3 Previous years of the STS shared task include more data sources . This year the task draws from two data sources and includes a diverse set of languages and language - pairs . 4 HTER is the minimal number of edits required for cor - rection of a translation divided by its length after correction .

The six tracks span four languages : Arabic , En - glish , Spanish and Turkish . Track 4 has subtracks with 4a drawing from SNLI and 4b pulling from WMT’s quality estimation task . Track 6 is a sur - prise language track with no annotated training data and the identity of the language pair ﬁrst an - nounced when the evaluation data was released . 3 . 2 Data Preparation This section describes the preparation of the eval - uation data . For SNLI data , this includes the se - lection of sentence pairs , annotation of pairs with STS labels and the translation of the original En - glish sentences . WMT quality estimation data is directly annotated with STS labels . 3 . 3 Arabic , Spanish and Turkish Translation Sentences from SNLI are human translated into Arabic , Spanish and Turkish . Sentences are trans - lated independently from their pairs . Arabic trans - lation is provided by CMU - Qatar by native Arabic speakers with strong English skills . Translators are given an English sentence and its Arabic ma - chine translation 5 where they perform post - editing to correct errors . Spanish translation is completed by a University of Shefﬁeld graduate student who is a native Spanish speaker and ﬂuent in English . Turkish translations are obtained from SDL . 6 3 . 4 Embedding Space Pair Selection We construct our own pairings of the SNLI sen - tences to deter gold entailment labels being used to inform STS scores . The word embedding sim - ilarity selection heuristic from STS 2016 ( Agirre et al . , 2016 ) is used to ﬁnd interesting pairs .

STS labels are then transferred to the translated pairs for cross - lingual and non - English tracks . The annotation in - structions and template are identical to Agirre et al . ( 2016 ) . Labels are collected in batches of 20 pairs with annotators paid $ 1 USD per batch . Five anno - tations are collected per pair . The MTurk master 9 qualiﬁcation is required to perform the task . Gold scores average the ﬁve individual annotations . 4 . 2 Expert Annotation Spanish - English WMT quality estimation pairs for Track 4b are annotated for STS by a University of Shefﬁeld graduate student who is a native speaker of Spanish and ﬂuent in English . This track differs signiﬁcantly in label distribution and the complex - ity of the annotation task . Sentences in a pair are translations of each other and tend to be more se - mantically similar . Interpreting the potentially sub - tle meaning differences introduced by MT errors is challenging . To accurately assess STS perfor - mance on MT quality estimation data , no attempt is made to balance the data by similarity scores . 5 Training Data The following summarizes the training data : Ta - ble 3 English ; Table 4 Spanish ; 10 Table 5 Spanish - English ; Table 6 Arabic ; and Table 7 Arabic - English .

Similarity scores for our pairings of the SNLI sentences are slightly lower than recent shared task years and much lower than early years . The change is attributed to differences in data selection and ﬁltering . The average 2017 similarity score is 2 . 2 overall and 2 . 3 on the track 7 English data .

ECNU is best overall ( avg r : 0 . 7316 ) and achieves the highest participant evaluation score on : track 2 , Arabic - English ( r : 0 . 7493 ) ; track 3 , Spanish ( r : 0 . 8559 ) ; and track 6 , Turkish - English ( r : 0 . 7706 ) . BIT attains the best performance on track 1 , Arabic ( r : 0 . 7543 ) . CompiLIG places ﬁrst on track 4a , SNLI Spanish - English ( r : 0 . 8302 ) . SEF @ UHH exhibits the best correlation on the difﬁcult track 4b WMT quality estimation pairs ( r : 0 . 3407 ) . RTV has the best system for the track 5 English data ( r : 0 . 8547 ) , followed closely by DT Team ( r : 0 . 8536 ) .

The baseline drops > 10 % relative on Arabic - English and Spanish - English ( SNLI ) vs . mono - lingual Arabic and Spanish . Many participant sys - tems show smaller decreases . ECNU’s top ranking entry performs slightly better on Arabic - English than Arabic , with a slight drop from Spanish to Spanish - English ( SNLI ) . 6 . 6 Methods Participating teams explore techniques ranging from state - of - the - art deep learning models to elabo - rate feature engineered systems . Prediction signals include surface similarity scores such as edit dis - tance and matching n - grams , scores derived from word alignments across pairs , assessment by MT evaluation metrics , estimates of conceptual simi - larity as well as the similarity between word and sentence level embeddings . For cross - lingual and non - English tracks , MT was widely used to convert the two sentences being compared into the same language . 15 Select methods are highlighted below . 14 e . g . , Reimers et al . ( 2016 ) report success using STS labels with alternative metrics such as normalized Cumulative Gain ( nCG ) , normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain ( nDCG ) and F1 to more accurately predict performance on the downstream tasks : text reuse detection , binary classiﬁcation of document relatedness and document relatedness within a corpus . 15 Within the highlighted submissions , the following use a monolingual English system fed by MT : ECNU , BIT , HCTI and MITRE . HCTI submitted a separate run using ar , es and en trained models that underperformed using their en model with MT for ar and es . CompiLIG’s model is cross - lingual but includes a word alignment feature that depends on MT . SEF @ UHH built ar , es , en and tr models and use MT for the cross - lingual pairs .

5 . Performance is reported by convention as Pearson’s r × 100 . For tracks 1 - 6 , the top ranking result is marked with a • symbol and results in bold have no statistically signiﬁcant difference with the best result on a track , p > 0 . 05 Williams’ t - test ( Diedenhofen and Musch , 2015 ) . ECNU ( Tian et al . , 2017 ) The best overall sys - tem is from ENCU and ensembles well perform - ing a feature engineered models with deep learn - ing methods . Three feature engineered models use Random Forest ( RF ) , Gradient Boosting ( GB ) and XGBoost ( XGB ) regression methods with fea - tures based on : n - gram overlap ; edit distance ; longest common preﬁx / sufﬁx / substring ; tree ker - nels ( Moschitti , 2006 ) ; word alignments ( Sul - tan et al . , 2015 ) ; summarization and MT evalua - tion metrics ( BLEU , GTM - 3 , NIST , WER , ME - TEOR , ROUGE ) ; and kernel similarity of bags - of - words , bags - of - dependencies and pooled word - embeddings . ECNU’s deep learning models are differentiated by their approach to sentence em - beddings using either : averaged word embeddings , projected word embeddings , a deep averaging net - work ( DAN ) ( Iyyer et al . , 2015 ) or LSTM ( Hochre - iter and Schmidhuber , 1997 ) . Each network feeds the element - wise multiplication , subtraction and concatenation of paired sentence embeddings to additional layers to predict similarity scores . The ensemble averages scores from the four deep learn - ing and three feature engineered models . 16 BIT ( Wu et al . , 2017 ) Second place overall is achieved by BIT primarily using sentence informa - tion content ( IC ) informed by WordNet and BNC word frequencies . One submission uses sentence IC exclusively . Another ensembles IC with Sul - tan et al . ( 2015 ) ’s alignment method , while a third ensembles IC with cosine similarity of summed word embeddings with an IDF weighting scheme . Sentence IC in isolation outperforms all systems except those from ECNU . Combining sentence IC with word embedding similarity performs best . HCTI ( Shao , 2017 ) Third place overall is ob - tained by HCTI with a model similar to a convolu - tional Deep Structured Semantic Model ( CDSSM ) ( Chen et al . , 2015 ; Huang et al . , 2013 ) . Sentence embeddings are generated with twin convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) . The embeddings are then compared using cosine similarity and element - wise difference with the resulting values fed to additional layers to predict similarity labels . The architecture is abstractly similar to ECNU’s deep learning models . UMDeep ( Barrow and Peskov , 2017 ) took a similar approach using LSTMs rather than CNNs for the sentence embeddings . 16 The two remaining ECNU runs only use either RF or GB and exclude the deep learning models . MITRE ( Henderson et al . , 2017 ) Fourth place overall is MITRE that , like ECNU , takes an ambi - tious feature engineering approach complemented by deep learning . Ensembled components in - clude : alignment similarity ; TakeLab STS ( ˇSari´c et al . , 2012b ) ; string similarity measures such as matching n - grams , summarization and MT metrics ( BLEU , WER , PER , ROUGE ) ; a RNN and recur - rent convolutional neural networks ( RCNN ) over word alignments ; and a BiLSTM that is state - of - the - art for textual entailment ( Chen et al . , 2016 ) . FCICU ( Hassan et al . , 2017 ) Fifth place overall is FCICU that computes a sense - base alignment us - ing BabelNet ( Navigli and Ponzetto , 2010 ) . Babel - Net synsets are multilingual allowing non - English and cross - lingual pairs to be processed similarly to English pairs . Alignment similarity scores are used with two runs : one that combines the scores within a string kernel and another that uses them with a weighted variant of Sultan et al . ( 2015 ) ’s method . Both runs average the Babelnet based scores with soft - cardinality ( Jimenez et al . , 2012b ) . CompiLIG ( Ferrero et al . , 2017 ) The best Spanish - English performance on SNLI sentences was achieved by CompiLIG using the following cross - lingual features : conceptual similarity using DBNary ( Serasset , 2015 ) , MultiVec word embed - dings ( Berard et al . , 2016 ) and character n - grams . MT is used to incorporate a similarity score based on Brychcin and Svoboda ( 2016 ) ’s improvements to Sultan et al . ( 2015 ) ’s method . LIM - LIG ( Nagoudi et al . , 2017 ) Using only weighted word embeddings , LIM - LIG took sec - ond place on Arabic . 17 Arabic word embeddings are summed into sentence embeddings using uni - form , POS and IDF weighting schemes . Sentence similarity is computed by cosine similarity . POS and IDF outperform uniform weighting . Combin - ing the IDF and POS weights by multiplication is reported by LIM - LIG to achieve r 0 . 7667 , higher than all submitted Arabic ( track 1 ) systems . DT Team ( Maharjan et al . , 2017 ) Second place on English ( track 5 ) 18 is DT Team using feature en - gineering combined with the following deep learn - ing models : DSSM ( Huang et al . , 2013 ) , CDSSM ( Shen et al . , 2014 ) and skip - thoughts ( Kiros et al . , 17 The approach is similar to SIF ( Arora et al . , 2017 ) but without removal of the common principle component 18 RTV took ﬁrst place on track 5 , English , but submitted no system description paper .

Engineered features include : unigram over - lap , summed word alignments scores , fraction of unaligned words , difference in word counts by type ( all , adj , adverbs , nouns , verbs ) , and min to max ratios of words by type . Select features have a mul - tiplicative penalty for unaligned words . SEF @ UHH ( Duma and Menzel , 2017 ) First place on the challenging Spanish - English MT pairs ( Track 4b ) is SEF @ UHH . Paragraph vector mod - els ( Le and Mikolov , 2014 ) are trained for Arabic , English , Spanish and Turkish . MT converts cross - lingual pairs into a single language and similar - ity scores are computed using cosine or the nega - tion of Bray - Curtis dissimilarity . The best perform - ing submission on track 4b uses cosine similarity of Spanish paragraph vectors with MT converting paired English sentences into Spanish . 19 7 Analysis Figure 1 plots model similarity scores against hu - man STS labels for the top 5 systems from tracks 5 ( English ) , 1 ( Arabic ) and 4b ( Spanish - English MT ) . While many systems return scores on the same scale as the gold labels , 0 - 5 , others return scores from approximately 0 and 1 . Lines on the graphs illustrate perfect performance for both a 0 - 5 and a 0 - 1 scale . Mapping the 0 to 1 scores to range from 0 - 5 , 21 approximately 80 % of the scores from top performing English systems are within 1 . 0 pt of the gold label . Errors for Arabic are more broadly distributed , particularly for model scores between 1 and 4 . The Spanish - English MT plots the weak relationship between the predicted and gold scores . Table 12 provides examples of difﬁcult sentence pairs for participant systems and illustrates com - mon sources of error for even well - ranking systems 19 For the cross - lingual tracks with language pair L 1 - L 2 , Duma and Menzel ( 2017 ) report additional experiments that vary the language choice for the paragraph vector model , us - ing either L 1 or L 2 . Experimental results are also provided that average the scores from the L 1 and L 2 models as well as that use vector correlation to compute similarity . 20 ECNU , BIT and LIM - LIG are scaled to the range 0 - 5 . 21 s new = 5 × s − min ( s ) max ( s ) − min ( s ) is used to rescale scores . including : ( i ) word sense disambiguation “making” and “preparing” are very similar in the context of “food” , while “picture” and “movie” are not similar when picture is followed by “day” ; ( ii ) attribute importance “outside” vs . “deserted” are smaller details when contrasting “The man is in a deserted ﬁeld” with “The man is outside in the ﬁeld” ; ( iii ) compositional meaning “A man is carrying a ca - noe with a dog” has the same content words as “A dog is carrying a man in a canoe” but carries a different meaning ; ( iv ) negation systems score “ . . . with goggles and a swimming cap” as nearly equivalent to “ . . . without goggles or a swimming cap” . Inﬂated similarity scores for examples like “There is a young girl” vs . “There is a young boy with the woman” demonstrate ( v ) semantic blend - ing , whereby appending “with a woman” to “boy” brings its representation closer to that of “girl” . For multilingual and cross - lingual pairs , these is - sues are magniﬁed by translation errors for systems that use MT followed by the application of a mono - lingual similarity model . For track 4b Spanish - English MT pairs , some of the poor performance can in part be attributed to many systems using MT to re - translate the output of another MT system , ob - scuring errors in the original translation . 7 . 1 Contrasting Cross - lingual STS with MT Quality Estimation Since MT quality estimation pairs are translations of the same sentence , they are expected to be min - imally on the same topic and have an STS score ≥ 1 . 22 The actual distribution of STS scores is such that only 13 % of the test instances score be - low 3 , 22 % of the instances score 3 , 12 % score 4 and 53 % score 5 . The high STS scores indicate that MT systems are surprisingly good at preserv - ing meaning . However , even for a human , inter - preting changes caused by translations errors can be difﬁcult due both to disﬂuencies and subtle er - rors with important changes in meaning . The Pearson correlation between the gold MT quality scores and the gold STS scores is 0 . 41 , which shows that translation quality measures and STS are only moderately correlated . Differences are in part explained by translation quality scores penalizing all mismatches between the source seg - ment and its translation , whereas STS focuses on differences in meaning . However , the difﬁcult in - 22 The evaluation data for track 4b does in fact have STS scores that are ≥ 1 for all pairs .

Tables 11 and 13 provide details on the composition of the benchmark . The data is partitioned into training , development and test sets . 23 The development set can be used to design new models and tune hy - perparameters . The test set should be used spar - ingly and only after a model design and hyperpa - rameters have been locked against further changes . Using the STS Benchmark enables comparable as - sessments across different research efforts and im - proved tracking of the state - of - the - art . Table 14 shows the STS Benchmark results for some of the best systems from Track 5 ( EN - EN ) 24 and compares their performance to competitive baselines from the literature . All baselines were run by the organizers using canonical pre - trained models made available by the originator of each method , 25 with the exception of PV - DBOW that 23 Similar to the STS shared task , while the training set is provided as a convenience , researchers are encourage to incorporate other supervised and unsupervised data as long as no supervised annotations of the test partitions are used . 24 Each participant submitted the run which did best in the development set of the STS Benchmark , which happened to be the same as their best run in Track 5 in all cases . 25 Sent2Vec : https : / / github . com / epfml / sent2vec , trained model Sent2Vec twitter unigrams ; SIF : https : / / github . com / epfml / sent2vec Wikipedia trained word frequencies enwiki vocab min200 . txt , https : / / github . com / alexandres / lexvec em - beddings from lexvec . commoncrawl . 300d .

The averaged word embedding base - lines compute a sentence embedding by averaging word embeddings and then using cosine to com - pute pairwise sentence similarity scores . While state - of - the - art baselines for obtaining sentence embeddings perform reasonably well on the benchmark data , improved performance is ob - tained by top 2017 STS shared task systems . There is still substantial room for further improvement . To follow the current state - of - the - art , visit the leaderboard on the STS wiki . 27 9 Conclusion We have presented the results of the 2017 STS shared task . This year’s shared task differed sub - stantially from previous iterations of STS in that the primary emphasis of the task shifted from English to multilingual and cross - lingual STS in - SIF : PTB tokenization provided by Stanford CoreNLP ( Man - ning et al . , 2014 ) with post - processing based on dev OOVs ; Word2vec : Similar to FastText , to our knownledge , the pre - processing for the pre - trained Word2vec embeddings is not publicly described . We use the following heuristics for the Word2vec experiment : All numbers longer than a single digit are converted into a ‘ # ’ ( e . g . , 24 → # # ) then preﬁxed , sufﬁxed and inﬁxed punctuation is recursively removed from each to - ken that does not match an entry in the model’s lexicon . 27 http : / / ixa2 . si . ehu . es / stswiki / index . php / STSbenchmark volving four different languages : Arabic , Spanish , English and Turkish . Even with this substantial change relative to prior evaluations , the shared task obtained strong participation . 31 teams produced 84 system submissions with 17 teams producing a total of 44 system submissions that processed pairs in all of the STS 2017 languages . For lan - guages that were part of prior STS evaluations ( e . g . , English and Spanish ) , state - of - the - art sys - tems are able to achieve strong correlations with human judgment . However , we obtain weaker correlations from participating systems for Ara - bic , Arabic - English and Turkish - English . This suggests further research is necessary in order to develop robust models that can both be readily applied to new languages and perform well even when less supervised training data is available . To provide a standard benchmark for English STS , we present the STS Benchmark , a careful selection of the English data sets from previous STS tasks ( 2012 - 2017 ) . To assist in interpreting the results from new models , a number of competitive base - lines and select participant systems are evaluated on the benchmark data . Ongoing improvements to the current state - of - the - art is available from an online leaderboard . Acknowledgments We thank Alexis Conneau for the evaluation of InferSent on the STS Benchmark .
