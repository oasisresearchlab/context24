We captured a self - renewing cell population with enhanced ectoderm potency from mouse epiblast stem cells ( EpiSCs ) by suppressing Nodal signaling activity . The transcriptome of the Nodal - inhibited EpiSCs resembles that of the anterior epiblast of embryonic day ( E ) 7 . 0 and E7 . 5 mouse embryo , which is accompanied by chromatin modiﬁcations that reﬂect the priming of ectoderm lineage - related genes for expression . Nodal - inhibited EpiSCs show enhanced ectoderm differentiation in vitro and contribute to the neuroectoderm and the surface ectoderm in postimplantation chimeras but lose the propensity for mesendoderm differentiation in vitro and inchimeras . Our ﬁndings show that speciﬁcationof the ectodermprogenitors is enhancedby the repressionof Nodal signaling activity , and the ectoderm - like stem cells provide an experimental model to investigate the molecular characters of the epiblast - derived ectoderm . INTRODUCTION Mouse gastrulation is a rapid and dynamic process that commences following the formation of the postimplanta - tion embryo , which is made up of the epiblast and visceral endoderm derived from the inner cell mass of the blasto - cyst , and the extra embryonic ectoderm derived from the trophectoderm . During gastrulation , at embryonic day ( E ) 6 . 5 to E7 . 5 , epiblast cells are allocated to the primitive streak for the generation of the mesoderm and deﬁnitive endoderm ( Lu et al . , 2001 ) , whereas cells remaining in the epiblast are endowed the ectoderm property ( Tam and Loebel , 2007 ) . Fate mapping the E7 . 5 late - gastrula mouse embryo revealed that the anterior epiblast is predis - posed for neural and surface ectoderm cell fates ( Tam , 1989 ) . Clonal analysis has further revealed the presence of bipotential progenitors in the anterior epiblast of E7 . 0 mid - gastrula embryo ( Cajal et al . , 2012 ) that can differen - tiate into both neural and epidermal lineage in vitro ( Li et al . , 2013 ) . These ﬁndings are consistent with the concept that the anterior epiblast of the gastrulating embryo har - bors the ectoderm progenitors . The process of speciﬁcation and commitment of the ectoderm lineage in developing embryo is less well under - stood . The paucity of molecular markers that signify the emergence of the lineage and the lack of appropriate experimental model for studying the biology of ectoderm progenitor cells have impeded our understanding of the development of the ectoderm lineage . In particular , there is an unfulﬁlled requirement for an in vitro cell - based model for studying ectoderm development . Pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs ) have been isolated from mouse embryos , such as the embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) from the epiblast of preim - plantation blastocyst ( Evans and Kaufman , 1981 ; Martin , 1981 ) , and the epiblast stem cells ( EpiSCs ) ( Brons et al . , 2007 ; Kojima et al . , 2014 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ) and ‘‘region - selective’’ EpiSCs ( rsEpiSCs ) ( Wu et al . , 2015 ) from the postimplantation epiblast . None of these stem cell types , however , consistently display predisposed ectoderm line - age potency . During gastrulation , Nodal and Wnt signaling play pivotal roles on the formation of the primitive streak , pro - gression of gastrulation , and tissue patterning in the ante - rior - posterior axis of the embryo . The spatial transcriptome study and analysis of gene - expression domain of the gas - trula stage mouse embryo revealed that cells in different re - gions of the epiblast are subject to different levels of Nodal and Wnt signaling ( Peng et al . , 2016 ; Pﬁster et al . , 2007 ) . Nodal signaling is active in the posterior epiblast for prim - itive streak formation and mesendoderm development ( Brennan et al . , 2001 ; Conlon et al . , 1994 ) . In contrast , the anterior epiblast that is fated for the ectoderm appears to be a ‘‘signal - silent’’ zone for Nodal activity through genome - wide study ( Peng et al . , 2016 ) .

Wnt - b - catenin signaling is required for axis formation and mesoderm induction in the mouse embryo . In the loss of Wnt3 ( Liu et al . , 1999 ) and b - catenin mutants ( Huelsken et al . , 2000 ) , mesoderm fails to form . The repression of Wnt signaling activity by the antagonist , such as DKK1 emanating from anterior visceral endoderm , is associated with the acquisition of ectoderm potency by the anterior epiblast ( Kimura - Yoshida et al . , 2005 ) . Loss of Dkk1 func - tion , which creates a gain of Wnt function , leads to the loss of brain and cranial structures ( Lewis et al . , 2008 ; Mu - khopadhyay et al . , 2001 ) , which could be related to an altered ectoderm potency of neural progenitor tissue . These ﬁndings imply that a diminished level of Nodal and Wnt signaling activity may underpin the acquisition of the ecto - derm lineage potency . Consistent with the concept that suppressing Nodal signaling enables the acquisition of ectoderm cell fates , blocking Nodal signaling promotes neural ectoderm differ - entiation of human ESCs in vitro ( Li et al . , 2011 ; Patani et al . , 2009 ; Smith et al . , 2008 ; Vallier et al . , 2004 ) , and dou - ble - mutant embryos of Nodal antagonists Cer1 and Lefty1 result in the loss of neural ectoderm and the ectopic differ - entiation of mesoderm ( Perea - Gomez et al . , 2002 ) . Loss of Nodal function leads to precocious neural differentiation and early loss of pluripotency of the epiblast ( Camus et al . , 2006 ; Mesnard et al . , 2006 ) . In mouse EpiSCs , block - ing activin signaling enhances neural differentiation ( Brons et al . , 2007 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ; Vallier et al . , 2009 ) . An ectoderm - like state can be induced in the mouse ESC - derived EpiSCs ( ESD - EpiSCs ) by Nodal inhibition ( Li et al . , 2015 ) . However , these ectoderm - like cells are unsta - ble and do not self - renew in vitro . In this study , we tested whether modulation of the Nodal and Wnt signaling activity may impact on the lineage po - tency of the mouse EpiSCs that were derived and main - tained under ﬁbroblast growth factor 2 ( FGF2 ) / activin A conditions . Our ﬁndings showed that inhibiting Wnt ac - tivity has no discernible effect of the lineage propensity of the established EpiSCs , while inhibiting Nodal activity can enhance the ectoderm lineage propensity . Nodal - inhibited EpiSCs differentiate efﬁciently to cells of the epidermis lineage in vitro while retaining the neuroecto - derm potential , but these cells lose the ability to differen - tiate into mesendoderm derivatives . RESULTS Inhibiting WNT Signaling Activity in Epiblast Stem Cells Has No Impact on Lineage Propensity EpiSCs were derived from the epiblast of the E6 . 5 early - primitive - streak - stage mouse embryo and maintained in culture supplemented with FGF2 and activin A . To assess the impact of abrogating WNTactivity on the lineage prop - erty of the established EpiSC , we added a chemical inhibi - tor ( IWP2 ) , which blocks WNT signaling by inhibiting the function of Porcupine that mediates the trafﬁcking and secretion of WNT ligand ( Gao and Hannoush , 2014 ) , to the culture for over ten passages ( IW - EpiSC ) ( Figure S1A ) . To characterize the differentiation potency of these EpiSCs , we assessed the expression proﬁle of lineage markers over 4 days of in vitro differentiation by microﬂuidic qPCR . The EpiSC and IW - EpiSC showed similar patterns of lineage differentiation in vitro in terms of the relative number of germ - layer - speciﬁc genes that were expressed at days 0 and 4 and the trajectory of lineage differentiation ( Figures S1B and S1C ) . These ﬁndings suggest that abrogating WNT activity did not rewire the lineage property of EpiSCs . How - ever , IW - EpiSCs in activin A - containing medium were potentially still subject to transforming growth factor b ( TGF - b ) signaling activity , such as Nodal , which may coun - teract any effect elicited by the inhibition of WNT activity on lineage propensity . We therefore proceeded to test the effect of inhibiting Nodal activity on the EpiSCs . Derivation of EpiSCs S / F from EpiSCs We tested the effect of blocking Nodal pathway using SB431542 ( SB43 ) ( Figure 1A ) , which inhibits the activity of TGF - b receptors . SB43 - treated EpiSCs cultured in chem - ical deﬁned medium ( CDM ) only ( without activin A and FGF2 ) showed extensive cell death ( Figure 1B ) , whereas those cultured in CDM supplemented with FGF2 formed epithelial colonies ( Figure 1B ) . From these colonies , a stable EpiSC line ( denoted as EpiSCs S / F ) that self - renewed for over 40 passages was derived and maintained in CDM + FGF2 + SB43 . Another EpiSC S / F line was also derived from EpiSCs generated from the epiblast of 129 strain E5 . 5 mouse em - bryo ( Figures S1D and S1E ) . EpiSCs S / F can also be derived from single cells from the parental EpiSC line ( Figure S1F ) . EpiSCs S / F could be reverted back to the EpiSC state by with - drawing SB43 and culturing in EpiSCs medium ( denoted EpiSC SF - AF ) . EpiSCs SF - AF showed morphology and transcrip - tome proﬁles similar to those of EpiSCs ( Figures 1C – 1E ) , indicating that the EpiSCs S / F have not been hard - wired to an SB / F - speciﬁc status . Immunocytochemistry revealed that the expression of the pluripotent factors , SOX2 and OCT4 , was comparable between EpiSCs and EpiSCs S / F ( Figure 2A , upper panels ) , while single - cell PCR results showed a lower average mRNA level of Oct4 in EpiSCs S / F compared with EpiSCs ( Figure 2B ) . EpiSCs S / F showed weaker alkaline phosphatase activity than ESCs and EpiSCs ( Figure S2A ) , but proliferated at rates as similar to those of EpiSCs ( Figure S2B ) . qRT - PCR analysis revealed that Nodal downstream target genes were suppressed in EpiSCs S / F ( Figure S2C ) . qPCR analysis re - vealed that treatment with SB43 induced a rapid repression 44 Stem Cell Reports j Vol . 11 j 43 – 57 j July 10 , 2018 of Fgf5 expression during EpiSCs S / F derivation ( Figures S2D and S2E ) . Analysis of Oct4 , Otx2 , T , Sox1 , and Ck18 at different passages ( Figures 2B and S2E ) , further showed that the EpiSC S / F maintained a stable phenotype on extended passaging . To characterize the EpiSCs S / F , we compared the transcrip - tome of EpiSCs S / F with that of EpiSCs derived with activin - FGF2 ( Kojima et al . , 2014 ) and the ESC - derived EpiSCs . Hi - erarchical clustering analysis of the transcriptome showed that EpiSCs S / F were grouped separately from EpiSCs and ESC - derived EpiSCs ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) ( Figure S3A ) . The expression of EpiSC markers ( Nanog , T , Fgf5 , Eomes , and Lefty1 ) was lower in EpiSCs S / F ( Figure 2A , middle panels ; Figure S2F ) . EpiSCs and EpiSCs S / F expressed similar level of junctional gene E - CADHERIN and anterior epiblast marker OTX2 , but EpiSCs S / F showed higher expression of another anterior epiblast marker , SIX3 ( Figure 2A , lower panels ) . Both EpiSCs and EpiSCs S / F did not express the markers of ESCs ( Rex1 , Esrrb , and Klf4 ) , and very low level of markers of mesendoderm cells ( Flk1 , Gata6 , and Sox17 ) , neural progenitor cells ( NPCs ) ( Pax6 , Zfp521 , and Nestin ) , and epidermis ( Ck18 , Ck19 , Ck8 and Grhl2 ) ( Figure S2F ) . Taken together , stable EpiSC S / F cell lines can be derived from established EpiSCs by inhibiting Nodal signaling , and these self - renewing cells are molecularly distinctive from naive ( ESC ) and primed pluripotent stem cells ( EpiSCs ) as well as three tissue progenitor cells . EpiSC S / F Exhibit Gene - Expression Proﬁles that Are Similar to the Ectoderm of Late - Mid - Streak - Stage Embryos Compared with EpiSCs , genes that were highly expressed in EpiSCs S / F are related to neural and epithelium devel - opment .

Stem Cell Reports j Vol . 11 j 43 – 57 j July 10 , 2018 47 ( legend on next page ) 48 Stem Cell Reports j Vol . 11 j 43 – 57 j July 10 , 2018 correlation analysis showed that EpiSCs S / F resembled most the anterior ectoderm of E7 . 0 and E7 . 5 embryo ( Fig - ures 3C , 3D , and S3B ) . In contrast , the parental EpiSCs are broadly similar to the epiblast of E6 . 5 embryo , the posterior epiblast of E7 . 0 embryo , and anterior epiblast of E7 . 5 embryo . To collate genes that may uniquely iden - tify the EpiSCs S / F , we analyzed genes that showed high expression in both EpiSCs S / F and E7 . 0 – E7 . 5 anterior ecto - derm , and found 13 commonly enriched transcription factors ( TFs ) ( Figure 4A ) . These 13 TF genes were ex - pressed exclusively in EpiSCs S / F and not in ESCs and EpiSCs ( Buecker et al . , 2014 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ) ( Figure 4B ) . EpiSC S / F thus represents a unique type of EpiSCs that may resemble the anterior ectoderm of the advanced gastrula embryo . To elucidate the chromatin characteristics of EpiSC S / F , we surveyed the genome - wide pattern of H3K27 acetyla - tion ( H3K27ac ) , H3K27 trimethylation ( H3K27me3 ) , and H3K4 trimethylation ( H3K4me3 ) in comparison with EpiSC . H3K27ac and H3K4me3 , which marked active promoters , were detected in the promoter region of many genes in both EpiSC S / F and EpiSC ( Figure S4A ) . We further characterized the histone modiﬁcations on lineage markers . In EpiSC S / F , active chromatin modiﬁca - tions ( high H3K4me3 , high H3K27ac , low H3K27me3 ) were found in the promoter of neural ectoderm marker genes ( Sox1 , Tuj1 ) , surface ectoderm marker genes ( Ck18 , Ck8 ) , and ectoderm - related genes ( Id1 , Id2 ) ( Fig - ures 4C and S4B ) . Mesendoderm marker genes ( Eomes and T ) that were expressed more highly in EpiSCs showed bivalent modiﬁcations ( high H3K4me3 , high H3K27me3 ) in EpiSCs S / F ( Figure 4C ) . Consistent with the RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) data , Nodal downstream genes ( Lefty1 and Lefty2 ) showed repressive modiﬁcation ( low H3K4me3 , low H3K27ac , high H3K27me3 ) in EpiSC S / F ( Figure 4C ) . These results on the epigenetic marks suggested that ectoderm lineage genes may be at an open to active state following the transition from EpiSC to EpiSC S / F . For the mesendoderm lineage genes , histone modiﬁcations were changed from active to biva - lent status in the EpiSCs S / F . These changes in histone modiﬁcations are consistent with the enhanced surface ectoderm potential and diminished mesendoderm potential of EpiSCs S / F , and may reﬂect the interplay for signaling and intrinsic programs during EpiSC S / F derivation . Taken together , the correlation of epigenomic modiﬁca - tion and the switch to ectoderm propensity point to the role of ectoderm - poised chromatin modiﬁcation in medi - ating the ectoderm propensity of EpiSCs S / F . EpiSCs S / F Behaved Like Anterior Ectoderm Progenitors in Chimeras To test the differentiation potential of EpiSCs S / F in an em - bryonic context , we assessed the contribution of EpiSCs S / F to germ - layer derivatives in postimplantation chimeras ( Huang et al . , 2012 ; Kojima et al . , 2014 ; Mascetti and Ped - ersen , 2016 ; Wu et al . , 2015 ) . RFP - expressing EpiSCs and EpiSCs S / F were grafted to anterior ( Ant ) , distal ( Dis ) , and posterior ( Post ) regions of the epiblast of E6 . 5 embryo ( Figure 5A ) , and the distribution of the graft - derived cells was examined after 48 hr of in vitro culture . A site - speciﬁc pattern of tissue distribution was observed ( Figure 5B ) . EpiSCs stayed as clumps , whereas EpiSCs S / F showed prolif - eration and incorporation when grafted to the anterior epiblast ( Figures 5B – 5D ) . EpiSCs S / F grafted into distal and posterior sites showed a much lower level of incorpo - ration and cell proliferation ( Figures 5B – 5D ) . Immuno - staining data showed that both EpiSCs S / F and EpiSC - derived cells expressed the appropriate neuroectoderm marker ( SOX2 ) and surface ectoderm marker ( CK18 ) . In contrast , EpiSC S / F - derived cells did not express mesendo - derm markers such as FOXA2 and TBX6 ( Figures 5E and 5F ) . When grafted into the E7 . 0 embryo ( Figure S5A ) , both EpiSCs and EpiSCs S / F remained unincorporated when grafted to the anterior epiblast ( Figure S5B ) , whereas EpiSCs S / F grafted into post sites showed similar frequency of incorporation but a lower level of cell proliferation than EpiSCs ( Figures S5C and S5D ) . Collectively , the ﬁnd - ings of chimera assay suggest that EpiSC S / F has acquired the developmental attribute that is compatible with the anterior epiblast of E6 . 5 embryo , and show ectoderm differentiation potential in the chimeras . While the EpiSCs S / F were similar transcriptome - wise to the E7 . 0 and E7 . 5 anterior ectoderm , they were developmentally incompatible when enforced to differentiate in the tissue environment of the E7 . 0 host embryo .

EpiSC S / F Display Propensity of Ectoderm Differentiation To assess the lineage potential , we generated embryoid bodies ( EBs ) from the EpiSCs and cultured in the presence of bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) that promote differ - entiation of the neuroectoderm , or in the absence of BMP for epidermis and mesendoderm differentiation ( Zhu et al . , 2014 ) . EpiSC S / F EBs showed higher expression of Sox1 ( a neural marker ) than EpiSC EBs ( Figure 6A , upper panels ) , but not early NPC markers such as Zfp521 and Nestin ( Figure 6A , upper panels ) . In BMP4 - supplemented medium , EpiSC S / F EBs displayed stronger expression of Ck18 , Ck8 , and CK19 ( epidermis markers ) than EpiSC EBs ( Figure 6A , middle panels ) . In contrast , BMP4 did not induce the expression of Flk1 , Gata6 , and Sox17 ( mesoderm and endoderm markers ) in EpiSC S / F EBs ( Figure 6A , lower panels ) . Immunostaining showed that similar population of cells in EpiSC S / F EBs and EpiSC EBs ( at day 4 of differen - tiation in BMP - free medium ) expressed neural markers ( TUJ1 and NESTIN ) , but more EpiSCs S / F expressed epidermal markers ( CK18 and CK8 ) ( Figure 6B ) . Relative to EpiSCs , fewer EpiSCs S / F expressed the mesoderm markers : FLK1 and NKX2 . 5 in BMP - supplemented medium ( Figure 6B ) and Foxa2 , Sox17 , Flk1 , and Gsc in serum - con - taining medium ( Figure 6C ) . We further assessed the ectoderm propensity of EpiSC S / F by studying the differentiation of a single - cell colony of EpiSCs and EpiSCs S / F in culture medium with or without BMP4 for 24 hr . More single cells in the EpiSC S / F clones dis - played higher expression of neural markers ( Sox1 , Nestin ) and epidermis markers ( Ck18 , Ck8 ) compared with those of EpiSC clones . Very low expression of mesendoderm marker T and Eomes was found in single cells from EpiSC S / F after 24 hr of differentiation in vitro ( Figure 6D ) . These results showed that EpiSCs S / F are more responsive to directed ectoderm differentiation but less amenable to mesendoderm differentiation . DISCUSSION Here , we report the derivation of a unique type of self - re - newing EpiSCs , the EpiSCs S / F , which display a distinctive molecular signature of ectoderm lineage propensity . Recent studies have shown that the functional attributes of stem cells in vitro can be modulated by signaling activity that are known to inﬂuence lineage fates ex vivo . For instance , EpiSCs , which are derived by culturing epiblast in FGF2 and activin A , acquire the molecular property of anterior primitive streak ( Kojima et al . , 2014 ) whereby embryonic cells in vivo are subject to strong Nodal signaling . As a result of extended exposure to activin A , EpiSCs may lose the abil - ity to differentiate into primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) , but EpiLCs generated by transient differentiation of ESCs retain the capacity to respond to WNT and BMP induction of PGCs ( Hayashi et al . , 2012 ) . Consistent with the fact that ex vivo ectoderm differentiation of the epiblast can be enhanced by suppressing Nodal signaling ( Li et al . , 2013 ) , blocking Nodal signaling in EpiSCs enables the derivation of EpiSC S / F cell lines that are poised for ectoderm differen - tiation . The gene - expression proﬁle of these cells matches the cells in the anterior ectoderm of E7 . 0 / E7 . 5 embryo that are fated for ectoderm differentiation . EpiSC S / F may therefore represent a cellular state when the pluripotent epiblast transits to the progenitors of neural and surface ectoderm . Our ﬁnding highlights the feasibility of generating line - age - speciﬁc stem cell lines by mimicking the signaling con - dition in the embryo for in vitro derivation and mainte - nance of EpiSCs . The EpiSC S / F shows an enhanced surface ectoderm propensity but a diminished propensity for mes - endoderm differentiation , which is coincidental with the Figure 5 .

Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t tests ( * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 ; n . s . , not signiﬁcant ) . 52 Stem Cell Reports j Vol . 11 j 43 – 57 j July 10 , 2018 active histone proﬁle of the promoter of surface ectoderm and epidermis genes , and the repressive proﬁle of the pro - moter of mesendoderm genes . The active modiﬁcations of the promoter of neuroectoderm markers and surface ectoderm markers in the EpiSC S / F point to a broadly ecto - derm - poised , though not neural - speciﬁc , chromatin modi - ﬁcation . In view of that the EpiSC S / F can be reverted back to the EpiSC state by changing the in vitro conditions , it is likely that the epigenetic program of EpiSCs S / F may be not ﬁxated even when they are self - renewing . In this re - gard , our study provides a glimpse of the interaction be - tween extrinsic signals and the epigenome in predisposing the transcription activity that speciﬁes the lineage propen - sity of EpiSCs . In essence , our work has extended the spectrum of primed PSCs by identifying a self - renewing EpiSC popula - tion with enhanced ectoderm propensity . These ecto - derm - poised EpiSCs may offer an amenable in vitro model , in parallel with the NPCs and the transient ectoderm pro - genitor cells , for investigating the mechanism of divergent speciﬁcation of neuroectoderm and epidermis lineages . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide of Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology . Derivation and Culture of EpiSCs S / F An established MEF - free EpiSC line from the Janet Rossant lab ( Rugg - Gunn et al . , 2012 ) and an EpiSC line derived from 129 strain E5 . 5 mouse embryo in our lab was used to generate EpiSCs S / F . Epiblast of E5 . 5 129 strain mouse embryo was dissected and cultured in CDM supplemented with 20 ng / mL activin A and 10 ng / mL basic FGF ( bFGF ) on a feeder layer for ten passages and then cultured in feeder - free condition as stable 129 EpiSC line . EpiSCs were maintained on serum - coated plates in CDM sup - plemented with 20 ng / mL activin A and 10 ng / mL bFGF . To derive EpiSCs S / F , we dissociated EpiSCs into small clumps with collage - nase IVand replated them on serum - coated plates in CDM supple - mented with 2 m M SB431542 and 10 ng / mL bFGF . To derive EpiSC S / F from single EpiSC , we dissociated EpiSCs by Accutase and plated them as single cell in 96 - well plates in CDM supple - mented with 2 m M SB431542 and 10 ng / mL bFGF . EpiSC S / F colony derivedfroma singleEpiSCwaspickedupon day8 andpassagedas a cell line . EpiSCs S / F were passaged using collagenase IV every 2 days . EpiSC S / F was cryopreserved using knockout serum replace - ment ( KSR ) plus 10 % DMSO and displayed similar post - thaw viability as the parental EpiSC . RNA Preparation and Real - Time PCR Total RNAs were extracted by using TRIzol ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . RNAs were reverse transcribed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) . Real - time PCR was performed using EvaGreen ( Biotium ) . Expression levels ofeachgenewerenormalizedtoGAPDHexpressionandcalculated by comparative C T . Primer Sequence Embryonic Tissue Sample Collection Timed - pregnant mice were euthanized for embryo collection at appropriate stages between E5 . 5 and E7 . 5 . Embryos were isolated out from decidua . In all stages , Reichert’s membrane and visceral endoderm was removed . Embryonic tissues were dissected by syringe needles and collected separately . E5 . 5 and E6 . 0 embryos were dissected into extraembryonic ectoderm and epiblast . E6 . 5 epiblast was separated into anterior ( A ) and posterior ( P ) halves . E7 . 0 and E7 . 5 epiblasts were dissected into anterior proximal ( AP ) , anterior distal ( AD ) , and posterior ( P ) fragments .

In brief , single - cell or small tissue samples were lysed and reverse transcription performed ( Peng et al . , 2016 ) . After the ﬁrst - strand synthesis , cDNA was preampliﬁed with KAPA HiFi Hotstart ReadyMix ( KAPABiosystems ) byIS - PCRprimerfor18 cycles . cDNA qualitywasassessed byqPCRexaminationof severalhousekeeping genes . qPCR was then performed on single - cell preampliﬁed cDNAs . For embryonic samples , cDNA was further veriﬁed by examining representative knownpositionmarkers suchas Sox2 and T to ascer - tain correct tissue dissection and adequate preampliﬁcation . For sequencing library construction , cDNA was puriﬁed using a 1 : 0 . 8 ratio of AMPure XP beads ( Beckman Coulter ) . After quantiﬁ - cation by Qubit , cDNA was applied to Bioanalyzer 2100 on a High - Sensitive DNA chip ( Agilent Bioanalyzer ) to check the library size distribution . Ampliﬁed cDNA ( (cid:3) 5 ng ) was then used to construct Illumina sequencing libraries using Illumina’s Nextera DNA sam - ple preparation kit following the manufacturer’s recommended manual . All sample libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 machine with at least 20 million cleaned reads . The sequencing was performed by Berry Genomics ( Beijing , China ) . RNA - Seq Data Processing Raw reads were mapped to mm10 using the TopHat version 2 . 0 . 13 program ( Trapnell et al . , 2009 ) . We assigned FPKM ( fragments per kilobase per million ) as an expression value for each gene using Cufﬂinks version 1 . 3 . 0 software ( Trapnell et al . , 2010 ) . Cuffdiff software was then used to identify differentially expressed genes between treatment and control samples ( Trapnell et al . , 2013 ) . Differentially expressed gene heat maps were clustered by hierar - chical clustering and visualized using Java TreeView software ( Sal - danha , 2004 ) . PCA analysis was performed using R ( http : / / www . r - project . org ) . Pearson correlation was used to compare cell lines with in vivo isolated embryonic tissue . In Vitro Differentiation EpiSCs and EpiSCs S / F were differentiated into EBs in KSR medium ( Glasgow minimal essential medium supplemented with 8 % KSR , 2 mM glutamine , 1 mM pyruvate , 0 . 1 mM nonessential amino acids , and 0 . 1 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ) and KSR medium plus 10 ng / mL BMP4 , respectively . RNA samples were collected every 2 days and analyzed by qPCR . For single - cell differentiation , EpiSCs S / F and EpiSCs were cultured singly for 7 days followed by the dissociation of the resultant clones into single cells . The sin - gle - cell suspension of each clone was split into two aliquots , with one used for neural differentiation ( KSR medium without BMP4 ) and the other for epidermis and mesoderm differentiation ( induced by 10 ng / mL BMP4 ) . After differentiation in vitro for 24 hr , 20 single cells were collected from each culture and analyzed by qPCR . Grafting and In Vitro Embryo Culture RFP - expressing PB ( PGK - neo ) and ACT - PBase plasmids ( Yang et al . , 2013 ) were co - transfected into cells by Lipofectamine ( Invitrogen ) tolabelthecellwithRFP . RFP - expressingEpiSCsandEpiSCs S / F were tested for their germ - layer differentiation potential by grafting (cid:3) 10 cells to the anterior and posterior sites of host ICR E6 . 5 and E7 . 0 embryos . Cells were dispersed into clumps using collagenase and collected for grafting . The engrafted host embryos were cultured in heat - inactivated rat serum under 5 % oxygen , 5 % car - bon dioxide , and 90 % nitrogen at 37 (cid:4) C for 48 hr ( E6 . 5 chimeras ) or 24 hr ( E7 . 0 chimeras ) . After in vitro culture , the embryo was pho - tographed to record the distribution of the grafted cells by ﬂuores - cence microscopy . The yolk sac and amnion were dissected away , the embryos were ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 1hr , and the embryos were embedded in OCT compound and cryosectioned . Immunoﬂuorescence Forimmunoﬂuorescence , cellswereﬁxedwithfreshlyprepared 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 0 . 5 hr at room temperature . Fixed cells and chimeric embryo cryosections were treated with blocking buffer ( PBS containing 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 , 5 % BSA , and 0 . 5 % normalgoatserum ) for 2 hrat roomtemperature . Thecellsandsec - tions were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer overnight at 4 (cid:4) C . The next day , cells and sections were washed and incubated with ﬂuorescent - labeled secondary antibodies at 1 : 500dilutionsfor1 hr at roomtemperature . Thecellsandsections were stained with DAPI and mounted in Mowiol mounting me - dium . Specimens were observed with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal mi - croscope . Primary antibodies used in this study include : Oct3 / 4 ( 1 : 200 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 5279 ) , T ( 1 : 200 , R & D Sys - tems , AF2085 ) , Sox2 ( 1 : 100 , Abcam , ab59776 ) , Nanog ( 1 : 200 , CST , 8822 ) , Fgf5 ( 1 : 50 , Santa Cruz , sc - 7914 ) , Tuj1 ( 1 : 400 , BioLegend , 801201 ) , Nestin ( 1 : 100 , made by our lab ) , Ck18 ( 1 : 100 , Abcam , ab668 ) , Flk1 ( 1 : 100 , Becton Dickinson , 561993 ) , Nkx2 . 5 ( 1 : 200 , Santa Cruz , sc - 8697 ) , Tbx6 ( 1 : 100 , Abcam , ab38883 ) , and Foxa2 ( 1 : 100 , Abcam , ab23630 ) . Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) experiments were carried out as described by Qiao et al . ( 2015 ) . In brief , cells were collected and ﬁxed in 1 % formaldehyde solution and quenched by 0 . 125 M glycine . Fixed cells were fragmented to a size range of 200 – 500 bp by using Bioruptor Pico . Solubilized fragmented chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against H3K4me3 ( Abcam , 8580 ) , H3K27me3 ( Millipore , 07 - 449 ) , and H3K27ac ( ActiveMotif , 39133 ) . Antibody - chromatin complexes were pulled down using protein G beads ( Dynabeads , 10004D ) , washed several times , and eluted . Reverse crosslink was performed subsequently under 65 (cid:4) C for at least 4 hr . Chromatin mixture solution was treated with RNase A and proteinase K to remove residual RNAs and proteins . Finally , fragmented DNA was extracted with phenol - chloroform and precipitated with ethanol . ChIP DNA was ﬁnally dissolved in nuclease - free water and quantiﬁed using Qubit . DNA fragments acquired from immunoprecipitation would be sub - jected to end - repaired , adaptor ligation , and PCR ampliﬁcationun - der the instruction of the manufacturers ( New England Biolabs , E7370 ) . ChIP - Seq Data Processing Raw reads were mapped to mm10 using Bowtie2 version 2 . 2 . 2 ( Langmead and Salzberg , 2012 ) . MACS2 version 2 . 1 . 1 . 20160309 54 Stem Cell Reports j Vol . 11 j 43 – 57 j July 10 , 2018 was used to call ChIP sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) peaks using broad peak calling mode ( with – broad option ) , as well as to identify dif - ferential ChIP - seq signals in different conditions ( Zhang et al . , 2008 ) . ChIPseeker ( Yu et al . , 2015 ) was used to annotate ChIP - seq peaks by using the mouse gene annotation GENCODE version M9 . deepTools ( Ramirezetal . , 2014 ) wasusedtosmoothandcalcu - late the ChIP - seq signal as the ratio between ChIP - seq data and corresponding input control data , as well as to visualize ChIP - seq signals .
