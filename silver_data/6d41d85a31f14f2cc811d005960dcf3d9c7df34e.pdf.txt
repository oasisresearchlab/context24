• if a factor is multidimensional , item parcels should be based on similar facets of the construct ; • item parceling may be used strategically to correct for non - normality problems ; • if the factor structure is not well - understood , do not parcel ; Total disaggregation model : in principle , more indicators are better than fewer , but if the number of indicators is too large , it will be difficult to achieve a good model fit ; 6 Appendix C : Specification of a priori models to be compared using SEM Consumer Behavior Consumer Behavior Attitudes A ad as a mediator of advertising effectiveness : Four structural specifications ( MacKenzie et al . 1986 ) C b C ad A ad A b BI C b C ad A ad A b BI C b C ad A ad A b BI C b C ad A ad A b BI Affect transfer hypothesis Reciprocal mediation hypothesis Dual mediation hypothesis Independent influences hypothesis 7 Appendix D : Classification of overall fit indices Overall fit indices Stand - alone fit indices Incremental fit indices Type I indices Type II indices NFI RFI IFI TLI [ χ 2 or f ] [ χ 2 / df ] CFI [ χ 2 - df ] TLI [ ( χ 2 - df ) / df ] χ 2 test and variations Noncentrality - based measures Information theory - based measures Others minimum fit function χ 2 ( C1 ) normal theory WLS χ 2 ( C2 ) S - B scaled χ 2 ( C3 ) χ 2 corrected for non - normality ( C4 ) χ 2 / df minimum fit function f Scaled LR NCP Rescaled NCP ( t ) RMSEA MC AIC SBC CIC ECVI ( S ) RMR GFI PGFI AGFI Gamma hat CN 8 Summary of overall fit ( or lack - of - fit ) indices ( a ) stand - alone fit indices : Index Definition of the index 1 Characteristics 2 Interpretation and use of the index Minimum fit function chi - square ( C1 ) ( N - 1 ) f BF , SA , NN , NP tests the hypothesis that the specified model provides a perfect fit ( within the limits of sampling error ) ;
