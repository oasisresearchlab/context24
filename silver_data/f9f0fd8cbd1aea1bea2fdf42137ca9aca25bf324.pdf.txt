Representative cryoEM fields of full - length coronin decorated ADP - actin . Full - length coronin bundles actin into thick bundles ( left ) and meshes ( right ) . Bar : 100nm .

Nature Structural & Molecular Biology doi : 10 . 1038 / nsmb . 2907 Supplementary Figure 3 Comparison of all possible docking modes of the coronin density and its model . ( a - f ) The density corresponding to coronin in our ADP state structure is fitted with our homology model of coronin . Due to the pseudo - seven - fold symmetry of coronin’s seven - bladed propeller , there are seven possible modes of docking . The docking that we chose in our paper ( a ) is significantly ( > 5 SD ) better than other possible dockings . The last possible mode ( model rotated by 6 / 7 × 360° ) cannot be generated , since the docking program automatically fits it towards the best model ( a ) .

( a ) Coomassie - stained gels of supernatant ( S ) and pellet ( P ) fractions of 1 µM Crn1 Δ CC cosedimented with 0 - 30 µM pre - polymerized wild type and mutant actins . ( b ) Quantification of Crn1 Δ CC binding by wild type and select mutant actins obtained for analysis of gels shown in ( a ) . Fractions of Crn1 Δ CC bound to various F - actins was determined by densitometry and plotted versus the concentration of F - actin .

Key residues that are shown in this study to be responsible for actin - coronin interaction are mapped on the surfaces of actin ( a , c ) and coronin ( b , d ) . The key groups of interacting residues are colored as in Table 1 , regardless of the interacting actin subunits .

The pseudo - atomic model of actin - Arp2 / 3 complex ( a ) is superimposed with that of ADP - F - actin - coronin , similarly to Figure 6 . ( b ) Relative position of coronin in the superimposed model ( the actin model from the actin - Arp2 / 3 complex is shown to simplify the comparison ) . ( c - d ) Coronin blocks binding of Arp2 / 3 complex at high coronin concentrations , when Arp2 / 3 complex and coronin compete for actin binding ( c ) , but allows binding of Arp2 / 3 complex to adjacent unoccupied actins ( d ) at low coronin concentrations . In all panels , actin subunits are delineated by grey transparent surfaces derived from their atomic models .
