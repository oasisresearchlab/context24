INTRODUCTION Endocytosis is an integrated process , found in all eukaryotic organisms , in which portions of the plasma membrane and extracellular ﬂuid are internalized . It serves an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and is essential in the uptake of certain nutrients , internalization of receptor - bound ligands , and regulated turnover of channels and transporters . Endocytosis can be divided into early events ( internalization from the plasma membrane ) and later events , i . e . delivery to the endosomes and then to the degradative compartment , which is the lysosome in animal cells or the vacuole in fungi and plants . The ﬁrst studies on this pathway were done on mammalian cells , with extensive morphological studies . More recently genetic approaches have been used with Drosophila melanogaster , Dictyostelium discoidium and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Mellman , 1996 ) . Genetic studies in yeast have revealed fundamental aspects of the internalization step of endocytosis that were previously unnoticed in mammals , such as the requirement for actin and some actin - associated proteins , and the involvement of certain lipids ( Geli and Riezman , 1998 ; Munn et al . , 1999 ; Wendland et al . , 1998 ) . Like higher eukaryotes , S . cerevisiae carries out ﬂuid - phase and receptor - mediated endocytosis , and endocytosis is also responsible for both regulated and constitutive downregulation of plasma membrane transporters . Fluid - phase endocytosis can be followed using the ﬂuorescent dye Lucifer Yellow carbohydrazide ( LY ) ( Dulic et al . , 1991 ) . Receptor - mediated endocytosis can be studied by following the fate of either the pheromone receptors , after binding their respective ligands , the a - and a - factor , or the fate of the ligand itself ( in the latter case , a - factor ) . Once internalized , a - factor and the a - factor receptor ( Ste2p ) , pass through early and late endosomes on their way to the vacuole , where they are degraded ( Riezman , 1993 ) . This is also the route followed by many transporters that undergo constitutive or regulated internalization triggered by excess substrate , stress or changes in nutrient availability ( Horak , 1997 ) . Initial screens for endocytic deﬁcient ( end ) mutants used banks of random mutants that were temperature - sensitive ( ts ) for growth . Testing for potential endocytic defects , using LY internalization and a - factor internalization assays , identiﬁed 3309 Journal of Cell Science 113 , 3309 - 3319 ( 2000 ) Printed in Great Britain © The Company of Biologists Limited 2000 JCS1458 Sequencing of the entire genome of S . cerevisiae has revealed the existence of ﬁve proteins containing EH domains . These are protein - protein interaction modules ﬁrst described in mammalian Eps15 , a protein that is involved in clathrin - dependent endocytosis . Two of the yeast proteins , End3p and Pan1p , are required for the internalization step of endocytosis . We report characterization of the nonessential ORF YBL047c which , like Eps15 , encodes a protein with three N - terminal EH domains . Deletion of YBL047c leads to a defective ﬂuid - phase endocytosis and to defective internalization of the pheromone a - factor and uracil permease . We therefore named YBL047c EDE1 , for EH Domains and Endocytosis . Ede1p expressed as a chromosomally encoded fusion to the green ﬂuorescent protein is localized in punctate cortical spots that only partially colocalize with actin patches . This localization is maintained when actin is depolymerized . Deletion of EDE1 impairs the diploid budding pattern , but has only a small impact on actin cytoskeleton organization , in contrast to the effects observed in pan1 cells and many end mutants impaired in proteins colocalizing with cortical actin patches . Genetic interaction was observed between EDE1 and RSP5 , which encodes the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5p essential for ubiquitin - dependent endocytosis of many plasma membrane proteins , thus further emphasizing the functional link between Rsp5p and the EH domain proteins . We also observed genetic interaction between EDE1 , and END3 or PAN1 , suggesting that Ede1p might be part of a yeast EH network implicated in endocytosis .

Deletion or mutations of these genes also results in defects in the diploid budding pattern ( Bénédetti et al . , 1994 ; Munn et al . , 1995 ; Vaduva et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 1997 ) . More recently , a screen was designed to isolate mutants defective in membrane uptake , using the ﬂuorescent lipophylic styryl dye FM4 - 64 . This endocytic tracer travels from the plasma membrane to the vacuolar membrane via intracellular vesicule membranes . One of the characterized mutants , dim2 - 1 , was shown to be in the PAN1 gene ( Wendland et al . , 1996 ) . Dim2 / pan1 mutants ( also identiﬁed by another genetic screen as mdp3 ) exhibit defective ﬂuid - phase endocytosis ( Tang et al . , 1997 ; Wendland et al . , 1996 ; Zoladek et al . , 1997 ) , impaired internalization of a - factor , and accumulation of deep plasma membrane invaginations ( Tang et al . , 1997 ; Wendland et al . , 1996 ) . Further studies of Pan1p revealed that its localization overlaps at least in part with that of actin patches ( Tang et al . , 1997 ) . Mutation of this protein ( deletion is lethal ) causes dramatic alterations of actin cytoskeleton organisation , and defects in budding patterns ( Tang et al . , 1997 ; Tang and Cai , 1996 ) . END3 was found to be a multicopy suppressor of pan1 - 4 mutant , and Pan1p and End3p were indeed found to interact physically ( Tang et al . , 1997 ) . Furthermore , Pan1p interacts with several other proteins required for endocytosis , apparently acting as a multivalent adaptor involved in the internalization step of endocytosis ( Wendland et al . , 1998 , 1999 ) . Systematic deletion and characterization of new open reading frames ( ORFs ) in EUROFAN ( European Functional Analysis Network ) provided an original way to identify new mutants affected in the endocytic pathway . The EUROFAN collection of about 850 strains disrupted in nonessential ORFs of unknown function that have been discovered during the sequencing of the S . cerevisiae genome were tested for ﬂuid - phase endocytosis using LY . These studies led to identiﬁcation of numerous deletion strains showing endocytic defects . Detailed analysis of some of the mutants showed that Tlg2p , a protein belonging to the t - SNAREs family , is involved in the biogenesis of early endosomes ( Séron et al . , 1998 ) . Studies of cells deleted for YJL204c revealed an unusual membrane trafficking defect in the recycling of endocytic material back to the plasma membrane ( Wiederkehr et al . , 2000 ) . In this study , we report characterization of YBL047c , identiﬁed in the course of the EUROFAN project as a novel example of a protein implicated in endocytosis . We have named this gene EDE1 , for EH domains and endocytosis . Sequence analysis revealed that EDE1 encodes the yeast protein that has the closest similarity at its N - terminal region to human Eps15 , which is involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Benmerah et al . , 1998 ; Carbone et al . , 1997 ) . The two proteins share three N - terminal EH ( Eps15 Homology ) domains , a central coiled - coiled region , and a proline - rich region ( central in Ede1p and C - terminal in Eps15 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Ede1p displays even more striking resemblance at its N - terminal EH region to the human Eps15R , which is also involved in endocytosis ( Carbone et al . , 1997 ; Coda et al . , 1998 ) . The EH domain is a protein - protein interaction domain , about 100 amino acids long , which is conserved in evolution . EH domains are present in a growing number of proteins , many of which are involved in endocytosis ( Santolini et al . , 1999 ) . Analysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome revealed four other genes coding for EH domain proteins . Pan1p , with two N - terminal EH domains , a central coiled - coil domain and a proline - rich region , resembles Ede1p , Eps15 and Eps15R . End3p carries one bona ﬁde N - terminal EH domain and a second region of limited similarity ( EH - like ) , while proteins encoded by ORFs YJL083w and YKR019c / IRS4 have one EH domain , and a short coiled - coil region in their C - terminal region ( Fig . 1 ) ( Santolini et al . , 1999 ) . Irs4p was identiﬁed in a genetic screen for ribosomal DNA silencing defects ( Smith et al . , 1999 ) . We present here the localization of Ede1p protein , which partially overlaps with actin patches , and the endocytic phenotype of ede1 D cells disrupted for this ORF . In addition to deﬁning the endocytic defect of ede1 D cells , we also show here that these cells display a defective diploid budding pattern , but only slight modiﬁcation of the actin cytoskeleton distribution . Finally , we have observed synthetic genetic effects between the ede1 D strain and different mutants deﬁcient for endocytosis , including mutants affected in the two EH domain proteins End3p and Pan1p . These data suggest that Ede1p might belong to an EH - domain protein network involved in endocytosis . MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains , plasmids and growth conditions All strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 . Standard genetic techniques were used . Cells were transformed according to Gietz et al . ( 1992 ) . Cells were grown at 30°C ( or 24°C for temperature - sensitive mutants ) in rich YPD medium ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % peptone and 2 % glucose ) or in deﬁned YNB minimal medium ( containing 0 . 67 % yeast nitrogen base without amino acids ) supplemented with appropriate nutrients and carbon source ( 2 % glucose , 4 % galactose plus 0 . 02 % glucose , or 2 % lactate ) .

The disruption cassette containing the kanMX4 - module was cloned into the pUG7 vector ( pYORC - YBL047c ) . A plasmid carrying the cognate gene was cloned by gap - repair into the pRS416 centromeric plasmid using the initial disruption cassette to yield the plasmid pYCG - YBL047c . Disrupted strain FSIL019 - 06A , pYORC - YBL047c and pYCG - YBL047c were obtained from EUROFAN , and were constructed by E . Schiebel and collaborators . Deletion of EDE1 in RH144 - 3D ( END3 ) , rsp5 and pan1 and isogenic parental cells was achieved by transforming strains with plasmid pYORC - YBL047c digested with Not I and Xho I enzymes , which allowed recovery of the insert containing the kan MX4 ﬂanked with promoter and terminator regions of the EDE1 gene . Deletion , which occurs by homologous recombination , was veriﬁed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA using oligonucleotides ﬂanking the inserted region . Genetic interaction between EDE1 and END3 was examined after crossing RH4973 ( ede1 D ) and RH266 - 1D ( end3 - 1 ) strains ( Table 1 ) . The diploid strain was sporuled , dissected and colonies derived from individual spores were tested for growth at different temperatures . For the GFP fusion construction , the 3 ¢ ﬂanking sequence of YBL047c including the stop codon was replaced by a PCR - ampliﬁed fragment containing the kanMX6 module as selection marker and the gene coding for the GFP ( S65T ) variant ( Longtine et al . , 1998 ; Wach et al . , 1997 ) . This fragment was generated by ampliﬁcation with oligonucleotides F2YBL047c ( 5 ¢ - GGATCTAGAA GCCGCCACTA ACTTTTTGTT GGATAGTGCT CGGATCCCCG GGTTAATTAA - 3 ¢ ) and R1YBL047c ( 5 ¢ - GGAAGAAGTA CAAAAAGAAG ACGAAATGGT CCATTACAGA GAATTCGAG CTCGTTTAAAC - 3 ¢ ) , using plasmid pFA6a - GFPS65T - kan MX6 as template ( Wach et al . , 1997 ) . This fragment was transformed into appropriate strains . Kanamycin resistant clones were selected on YPD plates containing G418 ( 200 m g / ml ) . Correct integration of the kanMX6 cassette was veriﬁed as described above . Lucifer Yellow accumulation assay Lucifer Yellow carbohydrazide ( Sigma ) accumulation in vacuoles was carried out essentially as described by Dulic et al . ( 1991 ) . Cells were grown at 30°C in YPD to exponential phase ( absorbance at 600 nm , A 600 = 0 . 2 - 0 . 5 ) . Cells were concentrated to A 600 = 20 in fresh medium and incubated for 1 hour in the dark in the presence of 8 mg / ml LY . Cells were then washed three times in 1 ml of ice - cold buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate / 10 mM sodium azide / 10 mM sodium ﬂuoride , pH 7 ) , and resuspended in this buffer . Samples were viewed by microscopy using FITC - ﬂuorescence optics and by phase contrast . Endocytosis assays The chromosomally encoded uracil permease is produced in very small amounts . For this reason , cells that produce the permease from a multicopy plasmid were used for accurate measurement of the permease activity and for immunodetection of the protein . Uracil permease endocytosis assays were performed on strains transformed with plasmid pgF ( Volland et al . , 1994 ) containing the FUR4 gene under the control of the GAL10 promoter . Uracil uptake was measured in exponentially growing cells as previously described ( Volland et al . , 1994 ) . a - factor internalization assays were done at 24°C according to the continuous presence protocol described by Dulic et al . ( 1991 ) . Yeast cell extracts and western immunoblotting Total cell extracts were prepared and uracil permease was analyzed on immunoblots as previously described ( Volland et al . , 1994 ) using an antiserum to the last ten amino acids of uracil permease . Primary antibodies were detected with a horseradish peroxidase - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG secondary antibody followed by ECL western blotting detection reagents ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Actin rhodamine - phalloidin staining Cells exponentially growing in YPD ( A 600 = 0 . 5 ) were ﬁxed by adding formaldehyde ( Prolabo ) to a ﬁnal concentration of 3 . 7 % . After 10 minutes , cells were washed successively with 0 . 1 M KPi buffer ( 0 . 02 M KH 2 PO 4 , 0 . 08 M K 2 HPO 4 , 1 M sorbitol , pH 7 . 5 ) containing 10 mM ethanolamine , then with 0 . 1 M KPi buffer , and resuspended in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) .

Latrunculin treatment of GFP - labelled cells Cells ( 500 m l ) expressing Ede1 - GFP growing exponentially in YPD medium were treated for 30 minutes at 30°C with 10 m l of latrunculin - A ( 10 mg / ml in DMSO ) or 10 m l of DMSO as control . Cells were then ﬁxed and prepared for rhodamine - phalloidin staining as described above . Visualization of bud scars Chitin in bud scars was visualized by ﬂuorescence microscopy after treatment of 300 m l of overnight culture ( containing old cells with many bud scars ) with calcoﬂuor ( Fluorescent Brightener 28 , Sigma ) . Cells were harvested by centrifugation , washed with 1 ml of PBS buffer and resuspended in 100 m l of PBS ; calcoﬂuor was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 100 m g / ml and cells were incubated for 5 minutes at 30°C in the dark . Cells were ﬁnally washed ﬁve times with PBS , mounted and observed . Slides were scanned in an orderly fashion to prevent recounting of cells . All cells in every ﬁeld were counted , up to a total number of 150 for haploids , and 500 for diploids . Microscopic observations presented in this paper were done using a Leitz microscope equiped with ﬂuorescence optics ; direct acquisitions were made with a CCD Princeton cooled camera equiped with the Metaview Imaging System . Confocal analysis was done with a Leica TCS 4D microscope . RESULTS Endocytic defects in ede1 D cells Construction of disrupted strains during the ﬁrst part of the EUROFAN project showed that ede1 ∆ cells are viable , and furthermore grow normally at 30°C and 37°C ( 90 minutes doubling time on rich medium for haploid wild type and ede1 ∆ strains ) . Ede1 ∆ cells display normal vacuole morphology . A major defect was observed when testing LY uptake in ede1 D cells within the course of the second part of the EUROFAN project . LY is a small ﬂuorescent molecule that accumulates in the vacuole in normal strains , where it can be easily visualized by ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Dulic et al . , 1991 ) . In mutants affected at different stages of endocytosis , ﬂuorescence is less bright or absent from the vacuole ( Munn and Riezman , 1994 ) . After 1 hour of LY treatment , ede1 ∆ cells showed substantially reduced vacuolar accumulation of LY when compared to the control strain ( Fig . 2 ) , indicating that ﬂuid - phase endocytosis in ede1 ∆ strain is strongly altered . This assay , however , cannot discriminate between a defect in internalization or recycling , or in subsequent steps of the endocytic pathway . We therefore compared receptor - mediated endocytosis in wild - type and ede1 D cells by measuring the internalization of the pheromone a - factor . The fraction of 35 S - labelled pheromone that became inaccessible to an acid wash after various times was determined ( Fig . 3 ) . In ede1 ∆ cells , the initial rate of a - factor internalization was lower than that in wild - type cells ( Fig . 3B ; about 35 % reduction ) . This indicated that deletion of EDE1 affected the internalization step of endocytosis . We also checked the effect of EDE1 deletion on the internalization step of endocytosis by measuring the clearance of the uracil permease from the plasma membrane . The uracil permease was previously shown to undergo basal endocytosis and degradation in actively growing cells ( Galan et al . , 1996 ) . The presence of excess substrate or stress conditions such as heat shock , nutrient deprivation or inhibition of protein synthesis , results in an acceleration of the permease turnover rate ( Séron et al . , 1999 ; Volland et al . , 1994 ) . After addition of cycloheximide , the fate of plasma membrane uracil permease was followed at 37°C in the ede1 ∆ strain complemented or not B . Gagny and others Fig . 2 . The ede1 ∆ strain is defective in accumulation of LY in the vacuole . LY uptake assays were performed at 30°C as described in Materials and Methods on control strain FHER001 - 03B ( EDE1 ) and FSIL019 - 06A ( ede1 ∆ ) cells .

The rate of a - factor internalization is reduced in ede1 ∆ cells . ( A ) Control RH144 - 3D ( EDE1 ) and isogenic ede1 ∆ cells ( RH4971 ) were assayed for a - factor internalization at 24°C as described in Materials and Methods . The graph corresponds to one representative experiment . ( B ) Internalization rate was determined between 2 and 15 minutes for four uptakes from two independent experiments at 24°C . The percentage of internalized a - factor at 15 minutes minus the percentage at 2 minutes was calculated and divided by the number of minutes between the two uptake times . 3313 A new yeast EH domain protein by the wild - type EDE1 gene on a CEN / ARS plasmid ( Table 1 ) . The complemented strain presented the same uracil permease internalization and degradation kinetics as the reference strain FHER001 - 03B ( data not shown ) . At different times after addition of cycloheximide , uracil uptake was measured and protein extracts were prepared and analyzed for uracil permease by western immunoblotting ( Fig . 4 ) . In complemented cells inhibition of protein synthesis triggered loss of uracil uptake and subsequent permease degradation . The ede1 ∆ mutation provided strong protection against loss of uracil uptake ( t 1 / 2 = 60 minutes , compared with 30 minutes in complemented cells ) . This slower internalization rate led to a decrease in the rate of permease degradation in ede1 ∆ strain relative to complemented cells ( Fig . 4 ) . Together these results indicate that deletion of EDE1 results in inhibition of the internalization step of endocytosis . This is the only trafficking defect observed in ede1 D cells . When examined within EUROFAN for the electrophoretic patterns of several proteins that undergo post - translational modiﬁcations along the secretory or vacuolar pathway , such as the vacuolar carboxypeptidase Y and alkaline phosphatase , no defects were observed in ede1 D cells ( S . Avaro and R . Haguenauer - Tsapis , unpublished data ) . In agreement with these observations , we found no delay in plasma membrane delivery of the Fur4p uracil permease in ede1 D cells relative to wild - type cells ( data not shown ) . Hence , deletion of EDE1 does not appear to impair the secretory pathway , nor the Golgi to vacuole trafficking . Deletion of EDE1 has a limited impact on actin cytoskeleton organisation Many mutants that exhibit endocytosis defects have dramatic alterations of actin cytoskeleton organization ; this is the case for mutations affecting END3 and PAN1 genes ( Bénédetti et al . , 1994 ; Tang and Cai , 1996 ) . We therefore examined the state of the actin cytoskeleton in ede1 D cells , by staining F - actin with phalloidin . In yeast cells , actin is present in two types of ﬁlamentous structures , cortical patches and actin cables , which extend along the axis of budding cells ( Kilmartin and Adams , 1984 ) . These characteristic polarized structures are redistributed during the successive phases of vegetative growth . At the beginning of the cell cycle , patches of actin are found at the site of bud emergence . During bud growth , cortical patches are found enriched in the bud , and actin cables extend towards the daughter cell . Before cytokinesis , a ring of actin is found around the bud neck ( Winsor and Schiebel , 1997 ) . Observation of phalloidin - stained ede1 ∆ cells revealed almost normal actin cytoskeleton organization at 30°C . At 37°C , however , subtle defects of actin patches were observed ( Fig . 5 ) . In some cells , patches appeared to be distributed between the mother cell and the bud , with little concentration in the bud . This observation was consistent with the osmosensitivity of ede1 ∆ cells ( to 1 M sorbitol ) , a phenotype of some actin mutants ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ) and some mutants with defects in actin cytoskeleton organization ( Moreau et al . , 1997 ) . These overall actin modiﬁcations in ede1 D cells , however , were very modest , consistent with the observation that deletion of EDE1 did not increase sensitivity to latrunculin - A ( LAT - A ) ( data not shown ) , a common phenotype of mutants that exhibit major actin cytoskeleton defects ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . ede1 ∆ cells show morphological modiﬁcations and an abnormal diploid budding pattern Defective budding patterns is a phenotype observed in many end mutants , most notably in end3 D ( Bénédetti et al . , 1994 ) and pan1 cells ( Tang and Cai , 1996 ) . MATa or MAT a normal haploid cells have an axial budding pattern in which the new bud is placed immediately adjacent to the last bud site . In contrast to this axial budding , MATa / a normal diploid cells bud alternatively from opposite poles , resulting in a bipolar pattern . When yeast cells bud , a ring of chitin is deposited in the cell wall at the base of the neck . After cell division , this chitin ring Fig . 4 . Internalization and subsequent degradation of uracil permease are impaired in ede1 ∆ cells . FSIL019 - 06A ( ede1 ∆ ) strain was cotransformed with pgF ( 2 m LEU2 GAL10 - FUR 4 ) , and either pYCG - YBL047c or control pRS416 plasmid ( Table 1 ) . Transformants were grown at 30°C to an A 600 of 0 . 75 with galactose as a carbon source , and then transferred for 15 minutes at 37°C . Cycloheximide ( 100 m g / ml ) was then added . ( A ) Uracil uptake ( permease activity ) was measured at 37°C at different times after the addition of cycloheximide . The results are expressed as a percentage of the initial activity . ( B ) Protein extracts were prepared at the times indicated after the addition of cycloheximide . Portions were analyzed for uracil permease by western immunoblotting . Detection of an unspeciﬁc band ( * ) , which remained stable during the experiment , shows that all the lanes were equally loaded . 3314 remains on the mother cell . We examined the pattern of chitin deposition in haploid and diploid ede1 D cells by calcoﬂuor staining , which permits the visualization of bud scars on the cell wall ( Fig . 6A ) . Ede1 D haploids displayed a normal budding pattern ( not shown ) . In contrast , 45 % of ede1 D diploids exhibited a random budding pattern , found in only 1 % of the corresponding wild - type cells . Hence , the budding pattern of disrupted cells was signiﬁcantly altered for a proportion of the population , as compared to their wild - type counterparts . A more severe defect in diploid budding pattern was reported for pan1 cells , which also had a defect in the haploid budding pattern ( Tang and Cai , 1996 ) . It is noteworthy that some cells in the population of haploid and diploid ede1 D cells exhibited an altered morphology , with enlarged and distorted cells and thicker mother - bud necks ( Fig . 6B ) ( 30 % , compared to about 1 % of morphologically altered cells in the control strain ) . Ede1 - GFP is located at or close to actin patches and its localization is maintained independently of polymerized actin To obtain possible insight into Ede1p function , we determined its subcellular localization . Detection of Ede1p was made possible by tagging the 3 ¢ end of the EDE1 chromosomal gene by a DNA fragment encoding the variant green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) GFP ( S65T ) - coding sequence , an improved brilliant version of GFP ( Heim et al . , 1995 ) . Endocytic assays using uracil permease as a marker protein indicated that the fusion protein was functional . Cells expressing Ede1 - GFP exhibited wild - type endocytosis with this assay ( data not shown ) . Localization of Ede1 - GFP is shown in Fig . 7A . This protein was localized in a set of small cortical patches . In unbudded cells these patches were distributed throughout the cell and appeared unpolarized . In cells in which bud emergence was impending , the patches were concentrated at the future bud emergence site , frequently appearing as a small ring . In cells with small buds , patches were concentrated in the developing bud , and in cells with large buds , patches were enriched at the neck between the mother and the bud . This cellular localization suggests that Ede1p might colocalize with some actin structures . We stained F - actin with rhodamine - phalloidin in cells expressing Ede1 - GFP . As shown in Fig . 7B , Ede1 - GFP appears colocalized with some actin patches , or to be localized close to them . However , in many cells , Ede1 - GFP staining revealed more spots than actin patches , and some actin patches did not seem to contain detectable Ede1p . Moreover , confocal analysis demonstrated the absence of complete overlap ( Fig . 7C ) . Interestingly , we observed rings of Ede1p in cells that do not display actin rings , suggesting that formation of Ede1p and actin rings may be separate events during cell cycle ( data not shown ) . Ede1p thus emerges as one of a growing number of proteins that are enriched at the presumptive bud site , and / or at the mother - bud neck . Because of this cellular localization of Ede1 - GFP , we wondered whether actin cytoskeleton alteration would B . Gagny and others Fig . 5 .

This drug binds G - actin ( Coué et al . , 1987 ) and thus causes rapid disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton by inhibiting actin ﬁlament assembly ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . Cells expressing Ede1 - GFP were treated with LAT - A for 5 or 30 minutes , and then ﬁxed and stained with phalloidin . Actin cables and cortical actin patches were no longer detectable by the 5 minute time point , whereas Ede1 - GFP remained localized in cortical patch - like structures at presumptive bud sites , in small buds , and at the mother bud neck of dividing cells ( data not shown ) . This localization remained up to 30 minutes after LAT - A treatment , despite complete loss of actin cytoskeleton polarity ( Fig . 8 ) . This indicates that the localization of Ede1p can be maintained in the absence of polymerized actin ﬁlaments . EDE1 genetically interacts with PAN1 , END3 and RSP5 The general structure of Ede1p closely resembles that of Pan1p , including several EH domains , a coiled - coiled region and a proline - rich region , which are all thought to mediate protein - protein interactions . Furthermore , Ede1p has similar subcellular localization to Pan1p , and like Pan1p is required for maximal efficiency of the internalization step of endocytosis . Pan1p displays physical interactions with proteins that are required for internalization , such as the EH domain protein End3p ( Tang et al . , 1997 ) and NPF - containing proteins Ent1p / Ent2p ( Wendland et al . , 1999 ) . Pan1 thermosensitive mutants exhibit synthetic lethality with mdp1 / rsp5 thermosensitive mutants ( Zoladek et al . , 1997 ) , impaired in the Rsp5p ubiquitin - ligase , which is required for cell - surface ubiquitination and subsequent internalization of numerous yeast plasma membrane proteins ( D . Rotin , O . Staub and R . Haguenauer - Tsapis , manuscript submitted ) . To gain further information on the function of Ede1p in the internalization step of endocytosis , we constructed double - mutant strains to examine the effect of EDE1 deletion in strains containing a thermosensitive mutation in one of the three concerned genes , END3 , PAN1 and RSP5 . The double mutants were analyzed for their growth at different temperatures and compared with single mutants and control strains . The end3 - 1 ede1 ∆ double - mutant cells were viable but grew signiﬁcantly slower on YPD medium at 24°C and especially at 30°C than either single mutant ( Fig . 9 and data not shown ) . In addition , it was unable to grow at 37°C , a temperature at which end3 - 1 still displayed slow growth , the restrictive temperature being only 38 . 5°C for Fig . 7 .

The pan1 - 10 ede1 ∆ double mutant was unable to grow at 32°C , and rsp5 - 1 ede1 ∆ cells did not grow at 34°C , whereas pan1 - 10 and rsp5 - 1 single mutants present temperature - sensitive lethality only at 37°C ( Fig . 9B ) . No growth defect was observed at 37°C for the ede1 ∆ mutant . Thus , EDE1 showed synthetic growth defects with PAN1 , END3 and RSP5 . DISCUSSION We describe in the present report that the yeast EH domain Ede1p is a nonessential protein required for maximal efficiency of endocytosis . EDE1 displays genetic interactions with two genes that are necessary for endocytosis , END3 and PAN1 . Ede1p is thus the third example of an EH domain protein involved in the internalization step of endocytosis in yeast . Strikingly , among the eight EH domain proteins already identiﬁed in higher eucaryotes , seven have been demonstrated to play a role in endocytosis , and to bind proteins involved in endocytosis ( Santolini et al . , 1999 ; Sengar et al . , 1999 ) , suggesting the existence of an intracellular EH - based protein - protein interaction network implicated in diverse cellular functions , including endocytosis . Knowledge relative to the EH domain greatly progressed during the past years . The three - dimensional structure of three EH domains has been solved , including those of two out of three EH domains of the human Eps15 ( reviewed in Santolini et al . , 1999 ) . A variety of approaches have been employed to determine the target sequences that bind to EH domains . The use of a phage - displayed combinatorial peptide library led to identiﬁcation of the motif Asn - Pro - Phe ( NPF ) as the optimal ligand preference . However , other peptides characterized by the presence of aromatic and hydrophobic amino - acids could be also recognized by some EH domains , including those of the ﬁrst and second EH domains of Ede1p ( Paoluzi et al . , 1998 ) . The best known EH domain protein in mammals is Eps15 , ﬁrst identiﬁed as a substrate of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase ( Fazioli et al . , 1993 ) . Eps15 , as the yeast Ede1p , displays ﬁve potential protein - protein interaction domains : three N - terminal EH domains , a coiled - coil domain and a proline - rich region . The EH - containing N - terminal region of Eps15 is responsible for binding to NPF - containing epsin , the best - known Esp15 partner involved in endocytosis ( Chen et al . , 1998 ) , and synaptojanins ( Haffner et al . , 1997 ) , which carry inositol 5 - phosphatase activities involved in synaptic vesicle recycling ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ) . The central coiled - coil domain of Eps15 is important for homodimerization of Eps15 and heterodimerization with other proteins ( Coda et al . , 1998 ; Sengar et al . , 1999 ) . Extensive work has been done on the role of Eps15 in endocytosis through its C - terminal proline - rich domain . This region of the protein presents multiple copies of DPF motifs ( Fig . 1 ) that bind to a - adaptin , one of the subunits of the clathrin adaptor complex , AP2 ( Benmerah et al . , 1996 ; Iannolo et al . , 1997 ) . Eps15 is indeed constitutively associated with AP2 ( Benmerah et al . , 1995 ) , and located together with AP2 at the rim of budding clathrin coated pits ( Tebar et al . , 1996 ) . The closely related Eps15R is also associated with AP2 ( Coda et al . , 1998 ) . Expression of deleted forms of Eps15 induced loss of plasma membrane staining for AP2 and clathrin , supporting a role for Eps15 in clathrin - coated pit assembly ( Benmerah et al . , 1999 ) . It is noteworthy that none of the yeast EH domain proteins display DPF motifs ( potential AP2 binding sites ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Deletion of the genes encoding proteins similar to the mammalian adapter AP2 subunits does not cause endocytic defects , and there is no evidence indicating complex formation or plasma membrane localization of these proteins ( Huang et al . , 1999 ) . In fact , the role of clathrin in endocytosis in yeast is not as clear as it is in mammals . Clathrin coated pits have not yet been identiﬁed ultrastructurally in yeast . None of the genetic screens for endocytosis mutants uncovered mutations in the genes encoding clathrin subunits . Deletion of CHC1 encoding the clathrin heavy chain , or thermosensitive mutations in CHC1 , caused only about a 50 % inhibition of B . Gagny and others Fig . 9 . EDE1 interacts genetically with PAN1 , END3 and RSP5 . The effect of EDE1 deletion was checked in strains carrying a temperature - sensitive mutation in PAN1 ( pan1 - 10 ) , RSP5 ( rsp5 - 1 ) , END3 ( end3 - 1 ) and in their respective parental strains , all listed in Table 1 . Overnight cultures of indicated strains were spotted onto YPD , and plates were placed at different temperatures . Growth was observed after 1 day at the indicated temperatures . 3317 A new yeast EH domain protein endocytosis of a - and a - factor receptors ( Tan et al . , 1993 ) , or the maltose transporter ( Penalver et al . , 1999 ) . Moreover , uracil permease endocytosis is unaffected in a chc1 thermosensitive mutant ( A . Gratias and R . Haguenauer - Tsapis , unpublished data ) . It was proposed that another coat protein ( s ) might contribute to endocytosis in this organism ( Penalver et al . , 1999 ) . This dissimilarity in endocytosis between yeast and mammals raises the question of the molecular mechanisms underlying involvement of yeast EH domain proteins in endocytosis . Pan1p , the most extensively studied protein of this family ( two EH domains ) appears crucial for endocytosis , together with End3p ( Tang et al . , 1997 ) , and NPF - containing partners such as Ent1p and Ent2p , which are homologous to Epsin ( Wendland et al . , 1999 ) . Pan1p is thus thought to be a multivalent adaptor required for endocytosis ( Wendland et al . , 1998 ) , even though its function might be quite distinct from that of Eps15 . Ede1p is a dispensable protein , whereas Pan1p is essential for viability . Ede1p displays features both similar to and distinct from those of Pan1p . When expressed from its own promoter in the normal chromosomal context , Ede1 - GFP is localized close to cortical actin patches . Pan1p was reported to be mainly colocalized with cortical actin patches ( Tang and Cai , 1996 ) . Ede1 - GFP structures seem more numerous than actin patches , a situation that was also reported for overexpressed Pan1p . But the question was raised in the latter case as to whether this resulted from overproduction of the protein ( Tang et al . , 1997 ) . As for pan1 thermosensitive mutant cells ( Tang et al . , 1997 ; Wendland et al . , 1996 ; Zoladek et al . , 1997 ) , ede1 D cells are defective in ﬂuid - phase endocytosis . The use of uracil permease as an endocytic marker provided evidence that the internalization step of endocytosis is inhibited in ede1 D cells . The twofold factor of inhibition of endocytosis of this marker is reminiscent of that observed for end3 D cells at 25°C ( Volland et al . , 1994 ) , but not as pronounced as that for other mutants such as end4 , act1 or arp2 ( Galan et al . , 1996 ; Moreau et al . , 1997 ; Volland et al . , 1994 ) . The ede1 D cells also display a reduced rate of internalization of a - factor . The extent of inhibition ( about 35 % ) , although clear and reproducible , is not as pronounced as that detected with uracil permease . Conversely , internalization of uracil permease is less affected in cells that lack END3 ( twofold inhibition at 25°C ) , under the same conditions internalization of a - factor is almost completely blocked in end3 D mutant cells ( at least sixfold inhibition ) ( Bénédetti et al . , 1994 ) . These observations indicate that internalization of various membrane proteins may be differentially affected in the absence of various EH domain proteins . EDE1 deletion resulted in only minor defects in the actin cytoskeleton , whereas various pan1 mutant cells exhibit complete actin delocalization at the restrictive temperature ( Tang and Cai , 1996 ; Wendland et al . , 1996 ) . The small effect of the EDE1 deletion on actin localization might be related to the fact that Ede1p localization is maintained under conditions leading to actin delocalization , as shown by latrunculin treatment . Whereas it has not been reported whether Pan1p localization is actin - dependent , it is noteworthy that Pan1p is delocalized in end3 cells at the restrictive temperature ( Tang et al . , 1997 ) , a situation also leading to actin delocalization ( Bénédetti et al . , 1994 ) . It is not yet known why mutations or deletions of so many genes encoding proteins located at or close to cortical actin patches , including Ede1p , lead to deﬁcient endocytosis . At the ultrastructural level , the cortical actin patches consist of ﬁnger - like invaginations of the plasma membrane around which actin and actin - binding proteins are organized ( Mulholland et al . , 1994 ) . It was proposed that these cortical actin patches might be the sites of endocytosis , organized bundles of actin ﬁlaments being required to drive scission of vesicles from invaginations of the plasma membrane ( Kübler and Riezman , 1993 ) . However , visualization of endocytosis of the a - factor receptor Ste2p at the ultrastructural level suggested that the sites of receptor internalization are furrow - like invaginations of the plasma membrane , evenly distributed on the plasma membrane , and distinct from the ﬁnger - like actin cortical patches concentrated at areas of active growth ( Mulholland et al . , 1999 ) . Ultrastructural localization of proteins such as Ede1p and Pan1p will be necessary to determine their distribution relative to ﬁnger - like or furrow - like invaginations of the plasma membrane . However , their polarized distribution suggests at least that they are probably not associated with all endocytic invaginations . Mutations or deletion of many genes encoding proteins that are localized , like Ede1p , at or near cortical actin patches , result in an altered bipolar budding pattern only ( Madania et al . , 1999 ; Vaduva et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 1997 ) or defects in both axial and bipolar budding patterns ( Tang and Cai , 1996 ) . Ede1 D cells belong to the ﬁrst group , and pan1 cells to the second ( Tang and Cai , 1996 ) . Axial and bipolar budding patterns seem to be the result of two separate pathways because either pattern can be disturbed without affecting the other ( Chant , 1999 ; Chant and Pringle , 1995 ; Zahner et al . , 1996 ) . Despite the wealth of information gathered so far concerning the correlation between defects in proteins located at or near cortical actin patches and abnormal budding , the fundamental mechanisms underlying the function of these proteins in this process are still not understood . The link between budding polarity alteration and deﬁcient - endocytosis phenotypes also remains to be explained . In this respect , it is noteworthy that among the long list of proteins that are localized at or near cortical actin patches , many appear to be involved in both processes ( partly reviewed in Wendland et al . , 1998 ) . The correlation between endocytic defects , actin patches and budding pattern defects observed for a variety of yeast mutants indicates that these processes are functionally interrelated in ways that remain to be elucidated . Explanations might come from the determination of the exact function of the different proteins involved , such as Ede1p and Pan1p , and their different interactions . Extensive studies on Pan1p have already indicated that it is probably part of a high molecular weight complex ( Wendland and Emr , 1998 ) , and demonstrated its physical interactions with numerous proteins including Sla1p ( Tang et al . , 2000 ) , the NPF containing epsin homologs Ent1p / Ent2p ( Wendland et al . , 1999 ) , or yAP180 , homologous to the mammalian clathrin assembly polypeptide ( Wendland and Emr , 1998 ) and to the EH protein End3p ( Tang et al . , 1997 ) . In addition , PAN1 displays genetic interaction with SLJ1 ( Wendland and Emr , 1998 ) that encodes a phosphatidyl - inositol polyphosphate - 5 - phosphatase implicated in endocytosis , and with RSP5 / NPI1 , encoding the essential ubiquitin - protein ligase Rsp5p ( Zoladek et al . , 1997 ) . We began to explore the potential interactions of EDE1 with a subset of these genes . We observed that deletion of EDE1 3318 increases thermosensitive phenotypes caused by mutations in PAN1 and END3 , suggesting that Ede1p might be a new component of the yeast EH network . The double mutant end3 - 1 ede1 D appeared especially defective , with growth already strongly affected at 24 - 30°C , suggesting that End3p and Ede1p might display redundant functions . The genetic interaction between EDE1 and RSP5 , as well as that between PAN1 and RSP5 , deserves attention . The human Eps15 was described to undergo EGF - induced monoubiquitination ( van Delft et al . , 1997 ) , but data are not yet available on ubiquitination of Pan1p , and we do not yet know whether Ede1p is ubiquitinated . Internalization of numerous yeast plasma membrane proteins requires their prior ubiquitination ( Hicke , 1999 ) , a modiﬁcation that appears in most cases to be dependent on the essential ubiquitin - protein ligase Npi1p / Rsp5p ( Rotin et al . , 2000 ) . In addition to its genetic interaction with PAN1 and EDE1 , RSP5 displays genetic interaction with MDP2 / VRP1 / END5 ( Zoladek et al . , 1997 ) , another gene encoding a protein located at cortical actin patches ( Vaduva et al . , 1997 ) and involved in endocytosis ( Munn et al . , 1995 ; Zoladek et al . , 1997 ) . Several observations indicate that Rsp5p probably plays a general role in endocytosis beyond its role in ubiquitination . Mdp1 / rsp5 cells are deﬁcient for ﬂuid - phase endocytosis ( Zoladek et al . , 1997 ) . Furthermore , a plasma membrane transporter , Gap1p , was shown to undergo normal ubiquitination but endocytosis was deﬁcient in cells having a modiﬁed Rsp5p ( Springael et al . , 1999 ) . The ﬁnding that the EDE1 deletion is synthetically lethal in an rsp5 thermosensitive mutant provides more evidence of a functional link between the actin network and ubiquitin - dependent endocytosis . Ede1p might interact with Rsp5p . The synthetic lethality between RSP5 and EDE1 might also be explained by a role of Ede1p in proper localization of Rsp5p , or might simply indicate that both proteins participate in the same pathway . Identiﬁcation of the cellular partners of Ede1p and its precise ultrastructural localization might help to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of this analog of Eps15 , and to understand the puzzling similarities and differences between involvement in endocytosis of the yeast and mammalian EH networks .
