Myosin 2 motors predominantly engage actin filaments of opposing orientation to drive contractile events , and are therefore not traditionally viewed as processive . However , recent in vitro experiments with purified non - muscle myosin 2 ( NM2 ) demonstrated myosin 2 filaments could move processively . Here , we establish processivity as a cellular property of NM2 . Processive runs in central nervous system - derived CAD cells are most apparent as processive movements on bundled actin in protrusions that terminate at the leading edge . We find that processive velocities in vivo are consistent with in vitro measurements . NM2 makes these processive runs in its filamentous form against lamellipodia retrograde flow , though anterograde movement can still occur in the absence of actin dynamics . Comparing the processivity of NM2 isoforms , we find that NM2A moves slightly faster than NM2B . Finally , we demonstrate that this is not a cell - specific property , as we observe processive - like movements of NM2 in the lamella and subnuclear stress fibers of fibroblasts . Collectively , these observations further broaden NM2 functionality and the biological processes in which the already ubiquitous motor can contribute . non - muscle myosin 2 | actin | processive Correspondence : poakes @ luc . edu , evitriolo @ augusta . edu , jbeach1 @ luc . edu Introduction The ability for actin - and microtubule - based molecular motors to processively " walk " along tracks , typically carrying cargo attached to their tails , is critical throughout physiology ( 1 – 5 ) . A simplified motor mechanochemical cycle includes ATP hydrolysis , track binding , P i release , a power stroke , track unbinding , and nucleotide exchange ( 6 ) . Processive motors are often dimers whose ability to walk along a cytoskeletal filament is dependant on the coordinated mechanochemical cycle and track binding of the motor pair to prevent the motor from diffusing away ( 7 , 8 ) . The fraction of each mechanochemical cycle a motor spends in its track - bound state , also known as its duty ratio , is thus critical for processivity . Most processive motors have a high duty ratio , spending the majority of their mechanochemical cycle in the track - bound state ( 9 ) , though increasing the number of motors in an ensemble can enhance the synergistic processivity of low duty ratio motors ( 10 ) . Myosin 2s are low duty ratio motors ( 11 , 12 ) that are the dominant contractile motor proteins in all cells ( 13 ) . The myosin 2 superfamily includes striated myosin 2 ( cardiac and skeletal ) , smooth muscle myosin 2 , and non - muscle myosin 2 ( NM2 ) . Mammalian cells express up to three isoforms of non - muscle myosin 2 ( NM2A , NM2B , and NM2C ) which are derived from three distinct genes ( MYH9 , MYH10 , and MYH14 , respectively ) ( 14 – 16 ) . All myosin 2s form hexameric " monomers " that consist of two myosin heavy chains ( MHC ) , two essential light chains ( ELC ) , and two regulatory light chains ( RLC ) ( 17 ) . This holoenzyme is referred to as a monomer because they dynamically polymerize , or assemble , into bipolar filaments with motor domains at opposing ends . Myosin 2 filaments contain between ∼ 15 - 300 monomers depending on the isoform ( 18 – 20 ) . While NM2 monomers are generally considered non - processive , NM2 filaments that contain many monomers could remain track - bound for extended periods because of the high probability that at least one of its motor heads is in contact with the actin filament at any given time . Indeed , NM2A and NM2B filament processivity has been observed in vitro ( 21 ) , though this required the presence of crowding agents for NM2A . No cellular observations or characterization for NM2 processivity , to our knowledge , has been reported . The lack of apparent NM2 processivity in cells could be attributed to the architecture of most actin networks . If the bipolar filament is presented actin filaments of opposing orientation , then both sets of motors can engage the respective actin , hydrolyze ATP , and produce force . This is the basic mechanism of contractile force generation that drives muscle contraction ( 22 , 23 ) , cell division ( 24 ) , and many more myosin 2 - dependent processes . However , if a bipolar filament is presented with a single actin filament , or a parallel actin bundle , then one set of motors can engage the actin while the opposing motors on the opposite end of the filament are less likely to engage . In this case , the engaging motors can dominate and processive movements are possible . Muscle myosin 2s , especially striated , are unlikely to encounter parallel actin bundles , as the sarcomere is vitally assembled with individual actin " thin filaments " in opposing orientation to drive contraction ( 25 ) . However , because NM2s are expressed in such a diverse array of cell types , they are more likely to encounter parallel actin bundles ( 26 ) that could support processive movements . Here , we provide the first cellular observations and characterization of myosin 2 processivity . Using multiple tagging approaches , we demonstrate processive filamentous NM2 that is independent of actin dynamics but is dependent Vitriol , Quintanilla and Tidei et al . | bioR χ iv | February 24 , 2023 | 1 – 11 Fig . 1 .

Finally , we show that processive - like movements occur in multiple cell types , demonstrating that this is not a cell - specific NM2 feature . Results Tagging RLC reveals NM2 Processive - like Anterograde Movements in CAD cells . Cath . a - differentiated ( CAD ) cells are a central nervous system derived cell line ( 27 ) that form broad actin - based lamellar protrusions , reminiscent of the leading edge of a neuronal growth cone . These lamellae contain both Arp - dependent actin mesh networks and Mena / VASP - dependent linear parallel actin bundles ( 28 ) . To observe all NM2 localization and dynamics in these protrusions , we expressed RLC with a C - terminal 3x - iRFP670 tag ( RLC - iRFP ; Fig . 1A ) . We observed filaments throughout the cell body , along transverse arcs , and nascent filament clusters in the protrusion ( Fig . 1A ) . As expected , many of these NM2 clusters moved retrograde towards the cell center , coupled with actin retrograde flow ( Fig . 1B - 1E , blue indicators ; Supplemental Movie S1 ) . However , unexpectedly , we also observed significant NM2 anterograde movements toward the leading edge ( Fig . 1B - 1E , orange indicators ) . These anterograde - moving puncta mostly originated from dense regions in the posterior protrusion , though they also occasionally partitioned off of existing NM2 filaments ( Fig . 1C , green arrows ; Supplemental Movie S2 ) . Anterograde puncta often reached the leading edge as in Fig . 1C . Using automated tracking analysis , we measured the kinetics of these retrograde and anterograde movements , finding retrograde velocities of ∼ 35 nm / s in magnitude ( Fig . 1E , blue ) and anterograde velocities of ∼ 60 nm / s ( Fig . 1E , orange ) . These values are consistent with actin retrograde movements in these cells ( 28 , 29 ) , and on a similar scale to in vitro processive measurements for NM2A and NM2B ( ∼ 120nm / sec and ∼ 40 nm / sec , respectively ) ( 21 ) , especially when accounting for retrograde flow . To determine the underlying actin architecture on which these anterograde movements were occurring , we co - expressed RLC - iRFP with the filamentous actin reporter FTractin tagged with mNeon - Green ( FTractin - Neon ; Fig . 1F - G , Supplemental Movies S3 - 4 ) . We readily observed anterograde RLC movements ( magenta ) on thick actin bundles ( grey ) that terminate at the leading edge . This architecture is consistent with parallel actin bundles assembled by the Mena / VASP family ( 28 ) . Tagging MHC reveals NM2 Processive - like Anterograde Movements in CAD cells . While these observations are consistent with processive NM2 , RLCs are promiscuous and can bind other members of the myosin 2 | bioR χ iv Vitriol , Quintanilla and Tidei et al . | Processive Myosin 2 Fig . 2 .

We sought , therefore , to confirm that these anterograde movements were indeed filamentous NM2 movements by expressing NM2A with an N - terminal EGFP ( EGFP - NM2A ) . Similar to the RLC , we observed filamentous structures in the cell body with nascent filaments appearing in the protrusion ( Fig . 2A ) . We again observed both retrograde and anterograde movements ( Fig . 2B - C ; Supplemental Movie S5 ) , and observed filaments partitioning while moving anterograde ( Fig . 2B , green arrows ) , before eventually reaching the leading edge or stalling and moving retrograde . Previous EM studies have observed activated monomeric NM2 in cells ( 34 ) , and NM2 is known to associate with various vesicular organelles that undergo directed transport ( 35 – 38 ) . To confirm that our anterograde movements were filamentous NM2 structures moving on actin , we imaged both EGFP - NM2A and FTractin - mScarlet in CAD protrusions ( Fig . 2D - F ; Supplemental Movie S6 ) . N - terminal tagging of NM2A coupled with high - resolution imaging reveals two puncta ∼ 300 nm apart , indicative of bipolar filamentous NM2 ( Fig 2H ) ( 39 , 40 ) . We readily observed these bipolar filaments at the tips of short actin protrusions ( Fig . 2E ) , on actin bundles ( Fig . 2F ) , and moving anterograde along actin bundles ( Fig . 2G ) . Collectively these different tagging approaches of the NM2 holoenzyme demonstrate the anterograde movements of filamentous NM2 along actin bundles near the leading edge . NM2 moves anterograde independent of actin dynamics . We next sought to isolate movement of the NM2 filaments from the underlying actin dynamics . We used a small - molecule inhibitor cocktail of jasplakinolide and latrunculin ( JL ) to stall actin dynamics , similar to previous work ( 41 ) , and monitored NM2 by expressing NM2A with a C - terminal HaloTag ( NM2A - Halo ) . This places all fluorophores into a single punctum at the middle of the bipolar filament ( Fig . 3A ) , in contrast to N - terminal tags which creates two puncta at opposing ends of the bipolar filament ( Fig . 2H ) . This C - terminal HaloTag provides higher Vitriol , Quintanilla and Tidei et al . | Processive Myosin 2 bioR χ iv | 3 signal to noise to closely monitor filament dynamics via kymographs or automated tracking . Prior to JL treatment , we observed both retrograde and anterograde movements of NM2A - Halo ( Fig . 3B - C , F ; Supplemental Movie S7 ) . After JL treatment , NM2A - Halo retrograde flow was largely abrogated , as evidenced by the vertical lines in the kymograph and reduced movements detected in automated tracking ( Fig . 3D - F ) . This is consistent with NM2 retrograde movements being dependent on actin dynamics . After JL treatment , however , we still observed robust anterograde movements ( Fig . 3D - F ; Supplemental Movie S7 ) . In addition , inhibition of retrograde flow increased the leading edge localization of NM2 ( Fig . 3D , G ) . Collectively , these data illustrate that the anterograde movements we observe are processive NM2 filaments and that NM2 can move processively in the absence of actin dynamics . Processive NM2 is dependent on actin architecture . Previous studies in CAD cells demonstrated that knocking out the monomeric actin binding protein profilin 1 ( PFN1 KO ) disrupts lamellipodia and pre - filopodial actin bundling , while over - expression of profilin enhances actin bundles at the expense of Arp2 / 3 - dendritic networks ( 28 ) . We therefore used different levels of profilin 1 expression to determine if altering the lamellipodia actin network affected NM2 anterograde movements . When NM2A - Halo was expressed in PFN1 KO CAD cells , it appeared largely diffuse and non - filamentous , with little apparent retrograde flow and few discernible processive anterograde movements ( Fig . 4A - B ; Supplemental Movie S8 ) . This lack of NM2 architecture and apparent decreased assembly is not surprising , considering the extent to which PFN1 - KO disrupts actin structures in these cells ( 28 ) . However , it does support a model that appropriate actin architecture in the form of linear arrays is required for processive NM2 anterograde runs . Indeed , anterograde moving NM2A - Halo labeled filaments were readily observed in membrane protrusions in CAD cells overexpressing PFN1 ( Fig . 4E ; Supplemental Movie S8 ) . Though the number of initiated anterograde events and run velocity were no different than controls ( GFP ; Fig . 4G - 4I ) , we did observe a significantly higher number of anterograde moving NM2A puncta that reached the leading edge ( Fig . 4J ) . We also observed persistent localization of these puncta at the tips of short actin spikes , likely pre - filopodial bundles ( Fig . 4C ; magenta arrows ) . The PFN1 overexpression data suggest that dendritic actin networks inhibit the ability of NM2A to move processively along pre - filopodia actin bundles . This model could explain why NM2A anterograde movements have not been reported in lamellipodia that are more dependant on Arp2 / 3 networks , like those found in migratory fibroblasts . Characterization of NM2 Isoform Processivity . To better understand processivity of NM2 isoforms , we evaluated the endogenous RNA , protein , and localization in CAD cells . Previous RNAseq data ( 28 ) demonstrated that MHC 2A ( Myh9 ) and MHC 2B ( Myh10 ) were transcribed at moderate levels , with ∼ 2 : 1 ratio of MHC 2A : MHC 2B ( mean = 2 . 20 + / - 0 . 28 ) , while MHC 2C ( Myh14 ) was Fig . 3 .

Correlative blots with EGFP intermediates revealed MHC 2A dominant over MHC 2B expression , again with an ∼ 2 : 1 ratio of MHC 2A : MHC 2B ( mean = 1 . 95 + / - 0 . 66 ) . Immunostaining of CAD cells also revealed robust NM2A signal with clear puncta extending into the protrusion , while NM2B signal was less continuous throughout the cell , with less signal above background in the protrusion ( Fig . 5C ) . This is consistent with previous localization in polarized cells , where NM2A extends more peripheral and NM2B remains more centripetal and rearward ( 42 ) . In addition to localization differences , NM2 isoforms were found to possess kinetic differences in processivity in vitro ( 21 ) . To determine if we could detect any differences in processivity kinetics in cells , we expressed NM2A - Halo or NM2B with a C - terminal HaloTag ( NM2B - Halo ) . When NM2A - Halo was expressed in CAD cells , we again observed robust processivity in the protrusions , with many runs reaching the leading edge ( Fig . 5D - E ; Supplemental Movie S9 ) . When NM2B - Halo was expressed in CAD cells , we observed processive runs but with clear differences relative to NM2A . NM2B runs again initiated from the dense cell body or from partitioning events off of retrograde moving NM2 clusters . However , the runs often stalled in the mid - protrusion region before reaching the leading edge ( Fig . 5G - H ) . Average velocity measurements revealed a mild but significant difference between the isoforms , with NM2A running over ∼ 70 nm / sec and NM2B running under ∼ 60 nm / sec ( Fig . 5F and 5I ; Table S1 ) . Processive NM2 in Fibroblasts . While the actin architecture and morphology of CAD cells provide opportunity for readily observable processive NM2 movements , we hypothesized that similar movements could and should still be occurring in diverse cell types , if perhaps less frequently . To explore this possibility , we imaged primary mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cells with NM2A endogenously labeled with EGFP ( EGFP - NM2A ) . When sampled with high spatial and temporal frequency , we observed processive NM2 movements in both subnuclear stress fibers ( Fig . 6A - B ; Supplemental Movie S10 ) and ventral stress fibers in the lamellar protrusions ( Fig . 6C - D ; Supplemental Movie S11 ) . Discussion We conclude that the anterograde movements we observe for NM2 are indeed processive for the following reasons : first , they travel against the direction of actin retrograde flow ; second , the velocity of movement is consistent with in vitro measurements of NM2 processivity ( 21 ) ; third , they often travel along actin bundles that terminate at the leading edge , the exact actin architecture where NM2 processivity would theoretically thrive ; and finally , stalling actin dynamics did not inhibit movement . These results , in combination with the previous in vitro work by Sellers and colleagues , establishes processivity as a property of NM2 filaments .

F and I ) Histograms of velocity measurements from automated tracking of NM2A - Halo and NM2B - Halo retrograde and anterograde movements in protrusions ( see Table 1 ) . Our collective observations provoke a range of questions , from the biophysical nature to the biological relevance of processive filaments . Previous studies have used a simple formula to estimate the likelihood of synergistic processivity for an ensemble of motors : r f = ( 1 − ( 1 − r ) n ) ( 1 ) where r f is the duty ratio of a filamentous ensemble , r is the duty ratio of an individual motor , and n is the number of motors in a filamentous ensemble ( 21 , 43 ) . As r f increases , the likelihood of processivity increases . Melli et al . calculated NM2A could be processive with a duty ratio of 0 . 05 and ∼ 50 motors per side of the bipolar filament ( ∼ 25 " monomers " per side with two motors per monomer ) ( 21 ) . Considering NM2A filaments mature with ∼ 30 monomers per filament ( ∼ 30 motors per side ) ( 18 ) , only two mature filaments would be required to create a processive ensemble . Previous EM studies ( 44 , 45 ) demonstrate the existence of filament stacks in the lamella , with multiple filaments in register . If many lamellar filamentous structures are indeed small sub - resolution stacks with at least two filaments , this would provide sufficient motors to maintain binding to the actin track and enable NM2A to move processively towards the leading edge . A similar theoretical approach was taken by Nagy et al . who calculated that NM2B would be processive with a duty ratio of 0 . 22 and ∼ 10 - 12 motors per side of the bipolar filament ( 43 ) , although previous contrasting work suggested NM2B monomer processivity ( 46 ) . This theoretical 10 - 12 NM2B motors is easily attained in a single filament . However , the increased duty ratio of NM2B relative to NM2A should lead to more motors engaged with filamentous actin , especially if there are multiple mature filaments in an ensemble in a dense actin network . We hypothesize that this increased actin binding explains our observation that NM2B filaments often struggle to reach the leading edge , as they are more easily entangled in the lamellar actin network . In addition , the moderate decrease in NM2B velocity relative to NM2A could be explained by this increased NM2B duty ratio and decreased ATPase kinetics ( 47 ) , adding drag to the ensemble with decreased motor cycling . In reality , our kinetic measurements are complicated by a number of factors . The cellular actin architecture is more complex than the in vitro assays . Cellular actin is decorated with an array of actin binding proteins , unlike the pure actin filaments in vitro . Any of these actin binding proteins could potentially enhance or inhibit processive NM2 . Cellular NM2 filaments are in dynamic equilibrium with monomeric NM2 , and could be bound to numerous binding partners ( see below ) . Perhaps most importantly , NM2 isoforms have the ability to co - assemble into mixed filaments ( 34 , 48 ) . The cell types analyzed in this study are skewed towards NM2A expression over NM2B . Our immunostaining of endogenous isoforms , consistent with previous observations ( 42 ) , demonstrates spatial sorting of NM2 filaments , with NM2B restricted to central regions in the cell body and NM2A extending more peripherally . Therefore , our kinetic measurements of peripheral EGFP - NM2A processivity are likely to be measuring filaments largely composed of NM2A , while EGFP - NM2B processive filaments in more centripetal regions are likely to be 6 | bioR χ iv Vitriol , Quintanilla and Tidei et al . | Processive Myosin 2 Fig . 6 .

Purple boxes in ( A ) and ( C ) indicate ROI for time - lapses in ( B ) and ( D ) , where processive movements are indicated with orange highlight . mixed NM2A / NM2B filaments . When NM2A and NM2B were mixed 2 : 1 in vitro and allowed to co - polymerize , the velocity was indistinguishable from NM2B alone ( 21 ) , suggesting that relatively small numbers of NM2B motors can significantly alter filamentous biophysical and kinetic properties . Therefore , we hypothesize that the EGFP - NM2B kinetics we measure for mixed NM2A / NM2B filaments are revealing the underlying properties of NM2B processivity . More sophisticated experimental approaches are required to further dissect these concepts . A curious question is " why has NM2 processivity not been previously reported ? " Certainly , there has been an abundance of live - cell imaging of NM2 . We suspect a confluence of factors can explain this discrepancy . Both subcellular conditions and experimental approach must be optimal . First , there must be a relatively high ratio between parallel actin bundles and other actin structures ( antiparallel bundles , mesh networks , etc . ) . This excludes many stress fibers , transverse arcs , contractile rings , cortices , lamella and lamellipodia . Second , actin retrograde flow must be significantly slower than the velocity of NM2 processive movements in order for the NM2 processive movements to be observable . This is especially true for NM2B , which has slower velocities in vitro and in cells . Considering retrograde flow in some immune cell lamellipodia can be ∼ 100 nm / sec ( 49 ) , many anterograde NM2 movements would be difficult to observe . Third , NM2 density must be sufficiently low to observe filament dynamics . Many regions of non - muscle cells contain dense actomyosin networks , and discerning the movements of individual filaments or small filamentous ensembles is beyond the resolution of most light microscopy . Considering these caveats , we suggest that protrusions with highly bundled parallel actin , as can be found in neuronal growth cones , filopodia , stereocilia , invadopodia , etc . , are the most likely subcellular environments where NM2 processivity might be apparent . Consistently , previous immmunostaining of neuronal growth cones demonstrated ample NM2 signal in peripheral structures and filopodia ( 50 , 51 ) . Finally , concerning experimental approach , temporal sampling frequency needs to be sufficiently high ( ∼ 1 - 2 Hz ) that processive movements can be revealed . Studies that observe NM2 dynamics in slower cellular processes ( e . g . migration , cytokinesis , epithelial dynamics , etc . ) by sampling with longer intervals are likely to miss any processive movements . The most outstanding question remains as to the biological function of processive NM2 . One obvious answer is that as a processive motor NM2 could act as a cargo transporter . Numerous NM2 binding partners have been identified ( 52 – 55 ) , and NM2 has been localized to various vesicle and organelle populations ( exocytic vesicles , lytic granules , lipid droplets , Golgi vesicles , etc . ) ( 35 – 38 ) . It is possible that these or other cargos are being transported to the distal regions of these parallel actin structures . However , as other specialized processive myosins ( e . g . myosins V , X and XV ( 56 , 57 ) ) exist with this capability , it is unclear why the cell would rely on NM2 for this function . One also wonders if processive NM2 in these structures would compete with or complement the function of these other myosins . Another potential model for the functional relevance of NM2 processivity is that it serves to localize NM2 itself into peripheral structures with parallel actin bundles . This model , however , seems inefficient compared to the numerous phosphorylation assembly mechanisms that are used throughout cell biology ( 52 , 58 ) . In addition , signaling pathways exist that specifically inhibit NM2 assembly at the leading edge ( 59 ) . It would be interesting to test if these pathways are turned off in CAD cells or during PFN1 over - expression . Manipulation of NM2 to dissect these models is likely to prove challenging . Studies that broadly inhibit NM2 function throughout the cell via knockdown / KO or small - molecule inhibitors ( e . g . blebbistatin ) would be difficult to interpret , as they would disrupt the entirety of the actomyosin network . Photomanipulation approaches that can target NM2 specifically in protrusions ( e . g . iLID - based inhibitor ( 60 ) ) might provide the spatio - temporal precision required . Finally , correlative imaging with NM2 and potential cargos , could also prove insightful but requires identifying potential cargos to make it practical . In conclusion , the identification of NM2 processivity forces us to broaden the potential functional roles for NM2 in cell physiology . While its dominant function is to drive contractility , its ability to function as a monomer , to drive actin expansion , to cross - link actin , and to move processively should not be overlooked .

NMIIA ( a . a . 1936 - 1950 , ECM Biosciences ) Rabbit polyclonal antibody used at 1 : 2000 NMIIB ( clone A - 3 , SC - 3769 - 42 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) Mouse monoclonal antibody used at 1 : 2000 GFP ( clone B - 2 , SC - 9996 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) Mouse monoclonal antibody used at 1 : 2000 Imaging . NM2 isoform analyses ( immunostaining and NM2A - Halo and NM2B - Halo imaging ) , JL experiments , and ventral lamellar EGFP - NM2A primary MEF imaging was done on a Zeiss Airyscan 880 Microscope using a Plan - Apochromat 63x / 1 . 4 Oil DIC M27 objective and 633 nm laser . Raw data was processed using Zen software with automated processing strength . Subnuclear stress fiber imaging in EGFP - NM2A primary MEF was done using total internal reflection fluorescence structured - illumination microscopy ( TIRF - SIM ) , as previously described ( 48 ) . To decrease the background artefact inherent in SIM processing , TIRF - SIM data were blurred once with " Smooth " in Fiji / ImageJ ( 64 ) . Imaging of CAD cells expressing RLC - iRFP , EGFP - NM2A , and NM2A - Halo in PFN1 KO / OE experiments was performed using a Nikon CSU - W1 SoRa spinning disk confocal microscope using a 100X 1 . 49NA SR objective and a Hamamatsu Fusion BT Camera . All images from these data sets were acquired in SoRa mode with the 2 . 8X magnifier . Movies used for NM2 - Halo tracking were acquired with 2×2 binning to enhance signal to noise and increase acquisition speed to 5 Hz . All data from the SoRa had background noise removed using Denoise . ai ( NIS - Elements , Nikon ) , a trained neural network that uses deep learning to estimate and remove the noise component of an image . Images acquired using 1×1 binning were also deconvolved in NIS - Elements using the Blind Deconvolution algorithm . Before analysis , images were exported into Fiji / ImageJ and corrected for photobleaching using the histogram matching algorithm . Western blotting . To quantify isoform ratios for NM2A and NM2B in CAD cells , whole - cell lysates were collected from untransfected , EGFP - NM2A expressing , and EGFP - NM2B expressing cells . By separating EGFP - tagged NM2 from endogenous , we obtained a ratio between the two bands for each isoform . Using an anti - GFP blot , we obtained a ratio between EGFP - NM2A and EGFP - NM2B . The final NM2A / NM2B ratio was then obtained using these three ratios : NM2A / EGFP - NM2A : EGFP - NM2A / EGFP - NM2B : EGFP - NM2B / NM2B . Quantification of myosin motion . All tracking analysis was performed in python . The code and example data can be found at https : / / github . com / OakesLab . Briefly , images were first filtered with a 15 pixel square Laplacian of Gaussian filter with a standard deviation of 2 , to emphasize the myosin filaments . Filaments were then tracked using the trackpy software package ( https : / / github . com / soft - matter / trackpy ) with the following relevant parameters : feature _ size = 11 pixels , memory = 2 , and separation = 3 . As trackpy doesn’t use sub - pixel localization the resulting tracks were filtered using a running window average over ∼ 2 . 5 seconds ( translating to 5 - 8 frames depending on the imaging frequency ) . The resulting tracks were further filtered to only consider tracks with a path length of at least 900 nm ( e . g . the length of ∼ 3 myosin filaments ) to ensure that we were only considering persistent motion . While tracks shorter than this certainly occurred , we restricted measurements to this range to ensure we could have confidence in the measurements of the particle velocities . To determine the direction of the flow , we first defined the image intensity center of mass . A vector drawn from the center of the image to the center of mass determined the mean direction of retrograde flow . The direction of the myosin movement was defined as the vector drawn from the first position in the smoothed track to the last . By calculating the dot product of these two vectors we were able to define an angle , θ , relative to the mean direction of flow . We considered any angle θ < π / 3 to be retrograde flow , while any angle θ > 2 π / 3 to be anterograde flow ( essentially creating 120 degree cone in each direction ) . Tracks with angles between these two directions were not considered in our analysis , as they were predominantly moving parallel to the edge of the cell . Mean values for both retrograde and anterograde flow rates were determined by fitting a gaussian to the histogram of the pooled data . The data is reported as the mean of the gaussian fit ± the standard deviation of the gaussian curve . Quantification of NM2A - Halo anterograde events . The number of NM2A - Halo anterograde events in lamellipodia protrusions was quantified by drawing an 8×8 µm region 8 | bioR χ iv Vitriol , Quintanilla and Tidei et al . | Processive Myosin 2 of interest against the leading edge and manually counting all puncta that moved > 1 µm in the anterograde direction during the duration of the movie . Three 8×8 µm regions were analyzed per movie and then averaged so that each movie recieved a single score . To quantify the density of NM2A - Halo puncta at the leading edge , all puncta within a 1 µm region of interest placed against the cell edge in lamellipodia protrusions were manually counted in frames 1 , 100 , and 200 . The number of puncta was divided by the area that was analyzed for each region , and then all puncta density values were averaged so that each movie received a single score . All manual counting was performed by researchers who were blinded to the experimental conditions and molecules being imaged . Statistical analysis . Number of cells analyzed and experimental replicates were as follows : Fig . 1E = 10 cells from 3 independent repeats . Fig . 3G = 17 cells from 3 independent repeats . Fig . 4G = 11 cells from 3 independent repeats . Fig . 4H = 12 cells from 3 independent repeats . Fig . 4I = 10 + cells for each condition from 3 independent repeats . Fig . 4J = 9 cells for each condition from 3 independent repeats . Fig . 5F = 21 cells from 3 independent repeats . Fig . 5I = 12 cells from 2 independent repeats To compare the number of anterograde NM2A movements in lamellipodia protrusions of PFN1 KO , control , and PFN1 overexpressing cells ( Fig . 4I ) , we used one - way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test . To compare the number of NM2A puncta at the leading edge of control and PFN1 overexpressing cells ( Fig . 4J ) , we used a student’s t - test . Statistical analysis was performed using Prism ( GraphPad ) . To compare the distributions of myosin 2A and 2B in both retrograde and anterograde flows ( Fig . 5F , I ) , we used a Kolmogorov - Smirnov test . Briefly , the cumulative distributions functions of the distributions were calculated and compared using the stats module from scipy . p - values less than 0 . 05 were considered significant . The anterograde distributions were found to be significantly different . Data availability .
