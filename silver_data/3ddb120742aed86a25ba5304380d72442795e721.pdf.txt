GPI - APs possess unique prop - erties in terms of their intracellular traf ﬁ cking and association with lipid rafts . Although it is clear that GPI - APs play critical roles in various biological phenomena , it is poorly understood how the GPI moiety contributes to these mechanisms . More than 30 genes are involved in the correct biosynthesis of GPI - APs . We here constructed a cell library in which 32 genes involved in GPI biosynthesis were knocked out in human embryonic kidney 293 cells . Using the cell library , the surface expression and sensitivity to phosphatidylinositol - speci ﬁ c phos - pholipase C of GPI - APs were analyzed . Furthermore , we identi ﬁ ed structural motifs of GPIs that are recognized by a GPI - binding toxin , aerolysin . The cell - based GPI - knockout library could be applied not only to basic researches , but also to applications and methodologies related to GPI - APs . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 021 - 02337 - 1 OPEN 1 Key Laboratory of Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biotechnology , Ministry of Education , School of Biotechnology , Jiangnan University , Wuxi , Jiangsu , China . 2 Research Institute for Microbial Diseases , Osaka University , Suita , Osaka , Japan . 3 WPI Immunology Frontier Research Center , Osaka University , Suita , Osaka , Japan . ✉ email : fujita @ jiangnan . edu . cn COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2021 ) 4 : 777 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 021 - 02337 - 1 | www . nature . com / commsbio 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 0 ( ) : , ; V arious types of proteins , including single - membrane - spanning or multi membrane - spanning transmembrane proteins , lipidated proteins , and peripheral proteins , are localized on the cell surface . A number of proteins are covalently bound with a glycolipid , named glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) , and are localized at the plasma membrane . GPI anchoring of proteins is one of the common posttranslational modi ﬁ cations in eukaryotes 1 – 4 . GPI confers unique properties to modi ﬁ ed proteins . GPI - anchored proteins ( GPI - APs ) are the major pro - teins that associate with lipid rafts , which are dynamic membrane microdomains composed of sphingolipids and cholesterol 5 . The association with lipid rafts regulates GPI - APs in polarized transport , endocytosis , and signal transduction in mammalian cells 6 – 9 . The core structure of GPI is conserved and consists of EtNP - 6 - Man - α 1 , 2 - Man - α 1 , 6 - Man - α 1 , 4 - GlcN - α 1 , 6 - inositol - phospholipid ( EtNP , ethanolamine - phosphate ; Man , mannose ; GlcN , glucosa - mine ) among eukaryotic species , whereas the lipid moieties and glycan side chains are different 10 . In mammalian cells , several side chain modi ﬁ cations on GPI - glycan structures are found . The ﬁ rst Man ( Man1 ) is modi ﬁ ed with a side chain , EtNP . The fourth Man ( Man4 ) can be attached to the third Man ( Man3 ) via an α 1 , 2 - linkage 11 . In some proportions of mammalian GPI - APs , N - acetylgalactosamine ( GalNAc ) is modi ﬁ ed to the Man1 through the β 1 , 4 - linkage 12 , 13 , and it can be further modi ﬁ ed by β 1 , 3 - galactose ( Gal ) 14 or β 1 , 3 - Gal with α 2 , 3 - sialic acid 15 , 16 . The GPI lipid portion is 1 - alkyl - 2 - acyl - glycerol or diacylglycerol in mammals . The biosynthesis of GPI is essential for embryonic develop - ment , neurogenesis , immune responses , and fertilization . Patho - logical congenital mutations in GPI biosynthetic genes cause inherited GPI de ﬁ ciencies ( IGDs ) , which are characterized by intellectual disability , epileptic seizures , hypotonia , and facial dysmorphisms 17 . Acquired mutations in a GPI biosynthesis gene in hematopoietic stem cells lead to paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria , in which hemolysis of red blood cells occurs by self - activation of the complement system 18 . On the other hand , the expression of GPI - APs , such as carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) 19 , mesothelin 20 , folate receptor 21 , glypican - 3 22 , and CD52 23 is upregulated in various cancer cells , and such GPI - APs are utilized as biomarkers and therapeutic targets . GPI biosynthesis and transfer to proteins are carried out in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . After GPI is transferred to proteins , the lipid and glycan parts of GPI moieties are processed at the ER and the Golgi during GPI - AP transport . Some GPI - APs are cleaved at the GPI moiety by GPI - cleaving enzymes ( GPIases ) 24 . There are at least 23 steps in which 33 genes ( including 21 phosphatidylinositol - glycan ( PIG ) genes and 6 post - GPI attach - ment to proteins ( PGAP ) genes ) are involved for correct GPI - AP biogenesis . Among them , it was reported that defects in 23 GPI biosynthetic genes cause IGDs 25 . Although the genes responsible for reactions in most steps were identi ﬁ ed , it is still not clear how GPI biosynthesis is regulated and which GPI structures are required for these functions . Here , we performed a systematic genetic disruption of GPI biosynthetic genes in a human embryonic kidney 293 ( HEK293 ) cell line , providing a knockout gene cell library with different GPI - anchor biosynthesis capabilities ( GPI - KO cell library ) . We used the CRISPR - Cas9 system to construct the library and sys - tematically analyzed the expression and sensitivity to phosphatidylinositol - speci ﬁ c phospholipase C ( PI - PLC ) of GPI - APs . We proved that the GPI - KO cell library can be applied to determine toxin recognition sites and the unique biological characteristics of prion proteins . Our GPI - KO cell library is a sustainable resource for exploring various applications and methodologies of GPI - AP biology . Results GPI - AP synthesis capacity of HEK293 cells . HEK293 cells , which are widely used in both basic and applied studies , were used to construct a GPI - KO cell library . We obtained the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis , processing , and transport of GPI - APs in HEK293 cells using RNA - seq ( Supple - mentary Fig . 1a ) . All the genes required for GPI - AP biogenesis were expressed in HEK293 cells , whereas the expression of some genes , such as PIGY , PIGZ , and B3GALT4 , was limited . In addition , the expression pro ﬁ les of genes encoding GPI - APs were analyzed . At least 67 GPI - APs were expressed ( TPM value ≥ 1 ) in HEK293 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . We detected endogenous GPI - APs expressed on the surface of HEK293 cells by ﬂ ow cytometry ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . Several GPI - APs that were not expressed in HEK293 cells were exogenously expressed , and their surface expression was detected ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) , suggesting that HEK293 cells could be used for the study of the biological characteristics of GPI - APs . Genetic disruption of GPI biosynthesis in HEK293 cells . Using similar strategies to those employed for the knockout cell libraries of N - glycosylation 26 and glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) 27 , genes encoding GPI biosynthesis were knocked out using the CRISPR – Cas9 system ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . We systematically designed knockout constructs targeting genes involved in GPI biosynthesis and validated the guide RNAs ( gRNAs ) for disrup - tion ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Table 2 ) . Two targets were selected on one exon of each gene and designed to allow knockout con ﬁ rmation by eliminating the sequence on that exon . Then , using the validated gRNAs , we constructed 32 gene knockout cells ( Fig . 1a ) , generating a GPI - KO cell library . Initial steps of GPI biosynthesis . GPI biosynthesis starts with the addition of N - acetylglucosamine ( GlcNAc ) to PI at the cytosolic side of the ER membrane . GPI - GlcNAc transferase ( GPI - GnT ) , composed of six core subunits , PIGA , PIGC , PIGH , PIGP , PIGQ , and PIGY , mediates GlcNAc to PI 28 ( Fig . 1a , Step 1 ) . KO of PIGA , PIGC , PIGH , and PIGP completely lost GPI - AP expres - sion , whereas KO of PIGQ and PIGY maintained weak expression of GPI - APs ( Fig . 2 and Supplementary Fig . 4a ) , suggesting that KO of regulatory subunits retained GPI - GnT activity . PIGL is required for the deacetylation of GlcNAc - PI to generate GlcN - PI 29 ( Fig . 1a , Step 2 ) . GlcN - PI is then ﬂ ipped into the luminal side of the ER . Inositol acyltransferase , PIGW , catalyzes the addition of an acyl chain to the 2 - position of the inositol ring on GlcN - PI to form GlcN - ( acyl ) PI 30 ( Fig . 1a , Step 4 ) . KO of these genes completely eliminated the synthesis of GPI - APs ( Fig . 2 and Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . GPI - mannosyltransferases ( GPI - ManTs ) and GPI - EtNP trans - ferases . The complex composed of PIGM 31 and PIGX 32 ( GPI - ManT - I ) ( Fig . 1a , Step 6 ) , PIGV 33 ( GPI - ManT - II ) ( Fig . 1a , Step 7 ) , PIGB 34 ( GPI - ManT - III ) ( Fig . 1a , Step 9 ) , and PIGZ 11 ( GPI - ManT - IV ) ( Fig . 1a , Step 10 ) catalyzes the transfer of the ﬁ rst , second , third , and fourth Man to the GPI intermediate . PIGM and PIGX make a complex for GPI - ManT - I . The surface expression of GPI - APs was completely removed by KO of PIGM , which encodes the catalytic subunit of GPI - ManT - I . On the other hand , weak expression of GPI - APs remained after KO of PIGX , which encodes the regulatory subunit . KO of PIGV also completely removed the surface expres - sion of GPI - APs . In contrast , KO of PIGB left some GPI - AP expression . The fourth Man modi ﬁ cation by PIGZ was nonessential and its KO did not affect the biosynthesis of GPI - APs ( Fig . 2 ) . Since both PIGB and PIGZ are α 1 , 2 - ManTs , we knocked out PIGZ in PIGB - KO cells to check the redundancy . Even if PIGZ was knocked ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 021 - 02337 - 1 2 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2021 ) 4 : 777 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 021 - 02337 - 1 | www . nature . com / commsbio out in PIGB - KO cells , the expression of CD55 was not changed ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) , suggesting that PIGB and PIGZ do not have redundancy . Since it was shown that other ER - localized ManTs such as ALG3 , 9 , and 12 , which are required for the bio - synthesis of lipid - linked oligosaccharides , have strict speci ﬁ city 35 , it would not be possible that those ManTs have redundancy to GPI - MTs . Instead , a GPI - anchor structure , in which a protein is attached to the second EtNP on Man2 , was found 36 . Therefore , it is possible that proteins linked to the second EtNP of GPI are expressed in PIGB - KO cells . Three EtNPs are added to Man1 , Man3 , and Man2 mediated by PIGN 37 ( GPI - EtNP transferase - I ) ( Fig . 1a , step 8 ) , PIGO and PIGF complex 38 , 39 ( GPI - EtNP transferase - III ) ( Fig . 1a , step 11 ) , and PIGG and PIGF complex 40 ( GPI - EtNP transferase - II ) ( Fig . 1a , step 12 ) , generating a complete GPI precursor consisting of EtNP - Man - ( EtNP ) Man - ( EtNP ) Man - GlcN - ( acyl ) PI . GPI - APs were still expressed in PIGN - de ﬁ cient cells , although the expression level was reduced to approximately 50 % . In PIGG - KO cells , the expression of GPI - APs was normal , whereas it was extremely low in PIGO - de ﬁ cient cells ( Fig . 2 ) . Although PIGB and PIGO mediate the addition of Man3 and EtNP to Man3 for protein binding , respectively , the KO cells did not completely lose GPI - AP expression . As mentioned above , we found a GPI - anchor structure in which a protein is attached to the second EtNP on Man2 36 . In PIGO - KO cells , a proportion of proteins utilize the second EtNP for GPI anchoring . GPI attachment to proteins . GPI - transamidase ( GPI - TA ) is a multisubunit complex containing ﬁ ve subunits : PIGK 41 , GAA1 42 , PIGT 43 , PIGS 43 , and PIGU 44 . It recognizes the C - terminal GPI attachment signal of proteins 45 . PIGK is a catalytic subunit that cleaves the GPI attachment signal and forms an enzyme - substrate intermediate 46 . GPI is then transferred to the newly exposed C - terminus of the protein 3 ( Fig . 1a , Step 13 ) . The deletion of every subunit caused the inactivation of GPI - TA , and GPI - APs were not synthesized ( Fig . 2 ) . GPI - anchor remodeling . PGAP1 is a GPI - inositol deacylase that removes an acyl chain from the inositol ring of GPI 47 ( Fig . 1a , Step 14 ) . Subsequently , a side chain EtNP attached to the second Man is removed by PGAP5 48 ( Fig . 1a , Step 15 ) . Although KO of PGAP1 or PGAP5 causes delayed transport of GPI - APs from the ER to the Golgi 47 , 48 , it did not affect the expression of GPI - AP on the cell surface at a steady state ( Fig . 2 ) . In the Golgi apparatus , GPI fatty acid remodeling occurs , in which an unsaturated fatty acid at the sn - 2 position of the GPI lipid is replaced with a saturated fatty acid . Elimination of an unsaturated fatty acid and transfer of a saturated fatty acid are mediated by PGAP3 49 , 50 ( Fig . 1a , Step 17 ) and PGAP2 51 ( Fig . 1a , Step 18 ) , respectively . The surface expression of GPI - APs in PGAP3 - KO cells was only mildly affected , whereas in PGAP2 - de ﬁ cient cells , the surface expression of GPI - APs , except prion , was signi ﬁ cantly reduced ( Fig . 2 ) . This is because , in PGAP2 - de ﬁ cient cells , lyso - GPI - APs having only one hydrocarbon chain are transported to the cell surface , but they are unstable and released from the plasma membrane . The expression of prion in PGAP2 - KO cells was almost comparable with that in WT cells , which was analyzed below . Glycan moieties in some GPI - APs are further modi ﬁ ed in the Golgi . PGAP4 transfers GalNAc to Man1 via 1 , 4 - linkage 12 , 13 ( Fig . 1a , Step 19 ) . B3GALT4 could transfer Gal to the GalNAc residue 14 ( Fig . 1a , Step 20 ) . The KO cells did not affect the expression of GPI - APs ( Fig . 2 ) . Shedding of GPI - APs from the cell membrane . GPI - APs can be cleaved at GPI moieties and released from the membrane as intact proteins ( Fig . 1a ) . Angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) , gly - cerol phosphodiesterase 2 ( GDE2 ) ( also known as GDPD5 ) , GPI - speci ﬁ c phospholipase D ( GPI - PLD / GPLD1 ) , and PGAP6 have GPI - cleaving enzyme ( GPIase ) activity on speci ﬁ c GPI - APs 24 . We also constructed gene knockout cells to study the biological function of speci ﬁ c GPI - APs . The surface expression levels of CD59 in PGAP6 - KO cells , CD55 in GPLD1 - KO , and CD55 and prion in GDPD5 - KO and ACE - KO cells were mildly but sig - ni ﬁ cantly higher than that in WT cells ( Fig . 2 ) . In the WT cells , a fraction of those GPI - APs would be released constantly by those GPIases . By the gene - KO , the surface expression was increased because the GPI - APs are not released . Fig . 1 The biosynthesis of GPI - APs in mammalian cells . a GPI biosynthesis is carried out in the ER , Golgi , and the cell surface through a series of catalytic reactions . It starts with the transfer of GlcNAc to PI . The ﬁ rst two steps occur on the cytoplasmic side of the ER , and then the modi ﬁ cation of polysaccharides and lipids occurs on the luminal side of the ER and Golgi . Proportions of GPI - APs further undergo side chain modi ﬁ cation .

PI - PLC hydrolyzes PI at the site between the phosphate and glycerol backbone 10 , 52 . Via treatment with PI - PLC , GPI - APs on the cell surface are cleaved and released ( Fig . 3a ) . When an acyl chain is modi ﬁ ed to the inositol ring , the GPI - APs show resistance to PI - PLC . Among the GPI - KO cell library , KO cells that still show GPI - APs on the cell surface were picked up and used to detect the PI - PLC sensitivity of GPI - APs with different GPI structures . In the WT cells , more than 90 % of CD55 and CD59 were cleaved by PI - PLC , whereas approximately 50 % of the prion proteins showed resistance to PI - PLC treatment ( Fig . 3b ) , suggesting that half of the prion expressed on the cell surface of HEK293 cells has an additional acyl chain . By KO of PGAP1 , which encodes GPI - inositol deacylase , GPI - APs showed complete resistance to PI - PLC ( Fig . 3b ) . In the PGAP2 - KO cells , the majority of GPI - APs were not cleaved by PI - PLC ( Fig . 3b ) , suggesting that GPI - APs retained on the cell surface in PGAP2 - KO cells are inositol - acylated . Since it is known that inositol - acylated GPI - APs cannot be a substrate for PGAP3 50 , GPI - APs that are not processed by PGAP1 may be expressed as inositol - acylated GPI - APs having three hydrocarbon chains in PGAP2 - KO cells . In other GPI remodeling - de ﬁ cient cells , including PGAP5 - KO , PGAP3 - KO , PGAP4 - KO , and B3GALT4 - KO cells , GPI - APs are processed by PI - PLC at a similar ef ﬁ ciency in WT cells . Similarly , cells defective in GPI - cleaving enzymes ( including PGAP6 - KO , GPLD1 - KO , GDPD5 - KO , and ACE - KO cells ) showed that GPI - APs were as sensitive to PI - PLC as WT cells . To determine the correlation of GPI - inositol deacylation with the presence of side chain EtNPs and Mans on GPI structures , we used cells defective in PIGN , PIGB , PIGO , PIGZ , or PIGG for GPI - AP cleavage by PI - PLC . In PIGZ - KO and PIGG - KO cells , the PI - PLC sensitivity of GPI - APs was normal , suggesting that the fourth Man and the second side chain EtNP on GPI do not affect GPI - inositol deacylation . On the other hand , in PIGO - KO cells , GPI - APs on the cell surface were resistant to PI - PLC treatment . KO of PIGB or PIGN mildly reduced PI - PLC sensitivity . These results suggest that the GPI structure affects GPI - inositol deacylation . Dissection of inositol - acylated GPI on prion . In the initial analysis of GPI - AP expression and PI - PLC sensitivity in the GPI - KO cell library , the prion protein behaved differently from other GPI - APs , such as CD55 and CD59 ( Figs . 2 and 3b ) . In PGAP2 - KO cells , CD55 and CD59 surface expression decreased by more than 90 % , whereas prion proteins on the cell surface were only 20 % reduced on average ( Fig . 4a and b ) . The PGAP2 - rescued cells restored the reduction in CD59 and CD55 ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . According to western blotting of cell lysates , CD59 and CD55 were not detectable in PGAP2 - KO cells , whereas prion proteins could be detected ( Fig . 4c ) . Approximately , 50 % of prion proteins were cleaved by PI - PLC in WT cells , whereas in PGAP2 - KO cells , 85 % of prion proteins on the cell surface showed resistance against PI - PLC ( Fig . 3b ) , suggesting that prion proteins have inositol - acylated GPI anchors . To determine whether PI - PLC resistance of prion proteins is caused by inef ﬁ cient inositol deacylation in HEK293 cells , we transiently overexpressed PGAP1 encoding a GPI - inositol deacy - lase in WT and PGAP2 - KO cells to facilitate inositol deacylation ( Fig . 4d ) . The sensitivity of prion proteins to PI - PLC increased when PGAP1 was overexpressed , and at the same time , prion expression was signi ﬁ cantly reduced in PGAP2 - KO cells . This con ﬁ rms that most of the prion protein on the surface of HEK293 cells is present without inositol deacylation . Compared with CD55 and CD59 , PGAP1 seems to have a lower af ﬁ nity with prion protein , which leads to the presence of prion protein without inositol deacylation in PGAP2 - de ﬁ cient cells . To determine regions of the prion protein that cause inef ﬁ cient deacylation by PGAP1 , we constructed EGFP - FLAG - tagged prion chimera proteins , in which the N - terminal ER insertion signal sequence , mature protein , or C - terminal GPI attachment signal was replaced with corresponding regions of CD59 ( Fig . 4e ) . Compared to endogenous prion proteins , the EGFP - FLAG - tagged chimeric constructs showed high PI - PLC sensitivity ( Fig . 4f ) . Nevertheless , PPP ( prion signal sequence / prion mature / prion GPI - attachment signal ) , CPP ( CD59 signal sequence / prion mature / prion GPI - attachment signal ) , and PPC ( prion signal sequence / prion mature / CD59 GPI - attachment signal ) constructs showed around 11 – 15 % resistance to PI - PLC in WT cells . On the other hand , the PCP ( prion signal sequence / CD59 mature / prion GPI attachment signal ) construct on the cell surface was almost completely cleaved by PI - PLC . These results indicate that the mature part of the prion protein determines unique PI - PLC resistance , probably its structure is not ef ﬁ ciently recognized by the GPI - inositol deacylase PGAP1 . Alternatively , it is possible that a lower % of PI - PLC sensitivity is caused by the prion dimer formation since it has been reported that prion proteins form dimer structures 53 . GPI - KO library for determination of GPI signatures recog - nized by aerolysin . Aerolysin 54 is a member of the pore - forming toxin family secreted from Aeromonas hydrophila , which causes Fig . 2 GPI - AP expression on the cell surface in the GPI - knockout cell library . Cell surface expression of three endogenous GPI - APs , CD55 , CD59 , and prion , was detected by ﬂ ow cytometry .

Aerolysin binds to GPI - APs to target cells , and the C - terminal peptide of aerolysin is cleaved off by cell surface proteases , forming an activated heptameric complex , which is inserted into the mem - brane and acts as a channel 55 . Therefore , cell lines defective in GPI biosynthesis showed resistance to aerolysin 56 . Although it has been reported that the GPI - glycan structure and N - glycan structures on GPI - APs are required for toxin binding 57 , 58 , the precise GPI signature recognized by aerolysin remains unclear . To determine the GPI structures that aerolysin recognizes , we used a GPI - KO cell library to compare the sensitivity of 15 cell lines to aerolysin ( Fig . 5a , b ) .

On the other hand , the cell lines with weak or no expression of GPI - APs on the cell surface , such as PIGA - , PIGB - , PIGO - , and PIGK - de ﬁ cient cells , showed resistance to aerolysin treatment ( Fig . 5b ) . In PIGK - de ﬁ cient cells , although non - protein - linked free GPIs are expressed on the cell surface , aerolysin does not bind with them , showing hyper resistance to aerolysin 57 , 59 . The PIGN - and PGAP2 - de ﬁ cient cells also showed resistance to aerolysin , even if GPI - APs were expressed at low levels ( Fig . 2 ) . On the other hand , PGAP5 - de ﬁ cient cells express GPI - APs on the cell surface at the same level as WT cells . However , the cells showed resistance to aerolysin ( Fig . 5a ) . PGAP5 - KO cells showed resistance to aero - lysin at 60 nM and then showed sensitivity at higher concentra - tions ( Fig . 5b ) . The phenotype was rescued by the expression of PGAP5 in PGAP5 - KO cells ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . The results indicate that the presence of EtNP on Man2 negatively affects the binding of aerolysin to GPI - APs . In addition , PGAP6 - de ﬁ cient cells are highly sensitive to aerolysin , probably due to the increased expression of GPI - APs on the cell surface . The slightly high sensitivity of PGAP4 - and B3GALT4 - de ﬁ cient cells to aerolysin means that the glycan side chain modi ﬁ cations of GPI weaken aerolysin binding . These observations indicate that the GPI - KO library is useful to clarify the signature of GPI for toxin recognition . Discussion Due to the complex biosynthetic pathway and variable side chain modi ﬁ cations of GPI anchors , it is dif ﬁ cult to compare how gene knockout impacts GPI - AP expression and function . Here , we established and utilized a knockout cell library to analyze the surface expression of GPI - APs and their sensitivity to PI - PLC and to determine the structural signature of GPIs recognized by aerolysin . In addition , we showed that prion proteins have unique properties , the majority of which was resistance to PI - PLC in HEK293 cells . In this study , we constructed a knockout cell library consisting of single - gene knockout cell lines . Since we have already validated a set of gRNAs against each GPI biosynthetic gene , the current knockout cell library could be established using these materials . It is possible to generate complicated GPI structures via a combination of the library with the gRNAs . When the effects of gene - KO on GPI biosynthesis in mam - malian cells are compared with those in yeast cells , similar and different phenomena are observed . It is known that yeast GPI1 , which is the mammalian PIGQ homolog , is a non - essential gene among the GPI - GnT genes , suggesting that GPI - GnT is still active in gpi1 - de ﬁ cient yeast cells 60 . The PIGQ - KO still showed the expression of GPI - APs , consistent with yeast GPI1 . On the other hand , KO of mammalian PIGZ , which encodes GPI - ManT - IV , did not affect the surface expression of GPI - APs , whereas the yeast homolog SMP3 is essential for the GPI biosynthetic path - way . The difference would be due to the different substrate recognition of the mammalian and yeast GPI - EtNP transferase - III ( mammalian PIGO and PIGF or yeast Gpi13 and Gpi11 ) 61 . The GPI - KO cell library could be utilized for the complementa - tion analysis of homologous genes in different species . The knockout cell library of GPI biosynthetic genes enables us to produce GPIs with unique structures and functions . In parti - cular , when KO cells defective in genes required for GPI glycan and lipid remodeling are used , we can evaluate the functions of GPI side chains and lipid moieties . In PGAP5 - KO cells , a side chain EtNP remains attached to the second Man on GPI . Although the expression of GPI - APs was compatible with that in WT cells , the KO cells showed resistance to aerolysin , providing evidence that aerolysin recognizes the second Man without modi ﬁ cation . Furthermore , the GPI - KO cell library would be useful to assay the effect of GPI structures on the conversion of prion proteins from cellular forms to scrapie forms . Some reports suggest the importance of GPI - anchors on prion structural changes and pathogenicity 62 – 64 . It would be possible to check the ef ﬁ ciency of prion structural changes dependent upon GPI structures by culturing KO cells with the scrapie forms . When a GPI attachment signal is added to the C - terminus of secretory proteins or extracellular regions of type - I membrane proteins , the proteins can be expressed as GPI - APs . Therefore , the GPI - anchoring system is useful to tether the target proteins on the cell surface ( Supplementary Fig . 7a ) . In addition , it is known that many GPI - APs are incorporated into extracellular vesicles , such as exosomes and virus - like particles ( VLPs ) ( Sup - plementary Fig . 7b ) . It has been reported that various immuno - modulatory proteins , antigens , and single - chain variable fragments are expressed as GPI - APs and loaded on VLPs to enhance immune responses , vaccination , and targeting , respectively 65 – 67 . Another unique feature is that puri ﬁ ed GPI - APs can be inserted into the cell membrane through their lipid moi - eties in vitro . This is called GPI cell painting 68 ( Supplementary Fig . 7c ) , which enables the addition of the characteristics into the targeted cells . When recombinant proteins are expressed as GPI forms , the KO cell library produces recombinant proteins with different GPI structures , which might affect protein behaviors , Fig . 4 Fractions of prion proteins in HEK293 cells possess inositol - acylated GPI . a Expression of CD55 , CD59 , and prion on the surface in WT and PGAP2 - KO cells was analyzed by ﬂ ow cytometry .
