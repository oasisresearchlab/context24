Introduction The  2 - adrenoreceptor (  2 AR ) is a member of the large family of G protein – coupled signaling receptors ( GPCRs ) , and is fundamentally regulated by ligand - induced endocytosis via clathrin - coated pits ( Moore et al . , 2007 ) . The functional conse - quences of regulated endocytosis , specifically whether catechol - amines produce sustained or transient effects , are determined by molecular sorting of internalized  2 ARs between recycling and lysosomal pathways ( Hanyaloglu and von Zastrow , 2008 ; Marchese et al . , 2008 ) .  2 ARs recycle efficiently to the plasma membrane after endocytosis , but , in contrast to the ability of some endocytic cargo to recycle essentially by bulk membrane flux , efficient recycling of the  2 AR requires a postsynaptic density 95 / discs large / zonus occludens - 1 ( PDZ ) domain – interacting motif present in its distal cytoplasmic tail ( Maxfield and McGraw , 2004 ; Hanyaloglu et al . , 2005 ) . If this motif is disrupted by phos - phorylation or mutation , internalized  2 ARs traffic preferentially to lysosomes and are degraded ( Cao et al . , 1999 ; Gage et al . , 2001 ) . The  2 AR - derived recycling motif can bind to a family of PDZ proteins related to Ezrin - binding phosphoprotein of 50 kD ( EBP50 ) or Na + / H + exchange regulatory factor ( NHERF ; Hall et al . , 1998 ; Cao et al . , 1999 ; He et al . , 2006 ) . These observa - tions , and results from the study of other PDZ motif – bearing GPCRs ( Wente et al . , 2005 ; Delhaye et al . , 2007 ; Hanyaloglu and von Zastrow , 2008 ) , have motivated the hypothesis that PDZ motifs mediate a discrete endosome - to - plasma membrane sorting operation ( Gage et al . , 2005 ; Wang et al . , 2007 ) . A problem with the PDZ - directed recycling hypothesis is that NHERF family PDZ proteins , although often concentrated in the cortical cytoplasm near endosomes , are not known to localize directly to the endosome membrane when expressed at endogenous levels ( Bretscher et al . , 2000 ; Donowitz et al . , 2005 ) , and can mediate additional effects on receptors ( Hall et al . , 1998 ) . It is also known that PDZ domain – mediated interactions P ostsynaptic density 95 / discs large / zonus occlu­ dens­1 ( PDZ ) domain – interacting motifs , in addition to their well­established roles in protein scaffold­ ing at the cell surface , are proposed to act as cis­ acting determinants directing the molecular sorting of transmembrane cargo from endosomes to the plasma membrane . This hypothesis requires the existence of a specific trans­acting PDZ protein that mediates the proposed sorting operation in the endosome mem­ brane . Here , we show that sorting nexin 27 ( SNX27 ) is required for efficient PDZ­directed recycling of the  2 ­adrenoreceptor (  2 AR ) from early endosomes . SNX27 mediates this sorting function when expressed at endog­ enous levels , and its recycling activity requires both PDZ domain – dependent recognition of the  2 AR cytoplasmic tail and Phox homology ( PX ) domain – dependent associ­ ation with the endosome membrane . These results iden­ tify a discrete role of SNX27 in PDZ­directed recycling of a physiologically important signaling receptor , and extend the concept of cargo­specific molecular sorting in the recycling pathway .

Subsequent analysis established that , although actin connectivity is sufficient to promote recycling of engineered receptors in the absence of a natural PDZ motif , this connectiv - ity does not fully recapitulate the natural characteristics of  2 AR recycling ( Lauffer et al . , 2009 ) . As such , we sought to test whether or not NHERFs 1 and / or 2 are actually the limiting factors for  2 AR recycling . To do so , we used an established HEK293 cell clone expressing a FLAG - tagged  2 AR construct and depleted both NHERF family proteins simultaneously using a mixture of RNA duplexes ( Fig . 1 B ) . We then applied a fluorescence flow cytometric assay to measure receptor inter - nalization occurring in response to application of the adrenergic agonist isoproterenol ( 10 µM ) , and recycling of receptors after subsequent washout of this agonist ( Fig . 1 C ) . As shown previ - ously , surface  2 AR immunoreactivity recovered nearly to con - trol levels within 50 min after agonist removal ( Fig . 1 C , solid line ; Cao et al . , 1999 ) , whereas surface recovery of an alanine - extended ( PDZ binding defective ) mutant receptor construct (  2 AR - Ala ) was greatly reduced ( Fig . 1 C , broken line ) . Calcu - lation of fractional recycling ( Hanyaloglu et al . , 2005 ) con - firmed this effect across multiple experiments ( Fig . 1 D , left and middle bars ) . Strikingly , simultaneous knockdown of NHERFs 1 and 2 did not have a major effect on  2 AR recycling when compared with control levels ( Fig . 1 D , first and third bars ) . Consistent with this , we also observed PDZ motif – dependent recycling of the  2 AR in a cell line ( PS120 ) that expresses NHERF proteins at low levels ( Donowitz et al . , 2005 ) relative to HEK293 cells ( unpublished data ) . Thus , we considered whether another PDZ protein might function alternately , or additionally , in endosome - to - plasma membrane trafficking of  2 ARs . An intriguing candidate was SNX27 ( also called Mrt1 ) , which is widely expressed and unique among PDZ proteins because it contains a PX domain with various membrane proteins can enhance net surface accu - mulation indirectly , such as by scaffold - promoted posttransla - tional modification ( Gardner et al . , 2007 ) or physical stabilization of proteins in particular plasma membrane domains ( Perego et al . , 1999 ) . A critical unresolved question , therefore , is whether there exists any trans - acting PDZ protein that sorts relevant motif - bearing cargo into the recycling pathway directly from the endosome membrane . Such a bona fide sorting protein for the PDZ - directed re - cycling pathway , if it exists , would be expected to possess sev - eral key properties . First , of course , the putative sorting protein should be capable of binding the relevant cis - acting PDZ motif . Second , the putative sorting protein should localize to , or physi - cally interact with , endosomes traversed by the internalized cargo . Third , the putative sorting protein should be essential for PDZ - directed recycling when expressed at endogenous levels . Fourth , and most important for establishing a direct endosome - based sorting function , the recycling activity of the putative sorting protein should require both binding to the cis - acting PDZ motif and localization to the relevant endosomes from which recycling occurs . Here , we show that sorting nexin 27 ( SNX27 ) meets all of these criteria , and that this PDZ protein plays an essential role regulating the  2 AR . Results and discussion Two NHERF family PDZ proteins that bind the  2 AR tail , NHERF1 and NHERF2 , are not known to localize to endosomes at steady state , but possess a C - terminal Ezrin / Radixin / Moesin ( ERM ) protein - binding domain ( Fig . 1 A ) that can mediate a network of protein connectivity linking integral membrane pro - teins to actin ( Bretscher et al . , 2000 ) . We initially proposed such indirect actin connectivity as the basis for  2 AR recycling Figure 1 .

Further , binding to the SNX27 PDZ domain in vitro was destabilized by the alanine extension that blocks the recycling activity of this sequence in intact cells ( Fig . 2 B , dotted line ; K d > 100 µM ) . We next asked if full - length SNX27 associates with endo - somes traversed by internalized  2 ARs . To do so , we expressed a that binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate en - riched on the cytoplasmic surface of early / sorting endosomes ( Lunn et al . , 2007 ; Rincón et al . , 2007 ) . SNX27 has not been shown previously to interact with the  2 AR’s PDZ motif , but sequence analysis suggests a close relationship between SNX27’s PDZ domain and those present in NHERF family pro - teins ( Fig . 2 A , bold residues ; Donowitz et al . , 2005 ) . In particu - lar , we noted similarity or identity at several residues thought to directly contact the PDZ motif ( colored residues ; Appleton et al . , 2006 ) . Consistent with this , equilibrium binding analysis Figure 2 . SNX27 is a distinct NHERF­related PDZ protein that interacts with the  2 AR in early endosomes .

Sequences obtained from the Swiss / UniProt database were aligned with ClustalW ( Thompson et al . , 1994 ) and displayed with ESPript ( Gouet et al . , 1999 ) . Secondary structure elements of the first PDZ domain of NHERF1 ( Protein Data Bank accession No . 1g9o ) are indicated above the alignment .

( B ) Interaction of the  2 AR - derived tail sequence with the SNX27 - derived PDZ domain . Purified , recombinant PDZ domain was mixed in increasing concentration with FITC - labeled peptides corresponding to the six C - terminal residues of the wild - type  2 AR ( a transplantable recycling sequence , solid line ) , or an alanine - extended version that lacks detectable recycling activity ( broken line ) .

S1 A ; Pearson’s coefficient = 0 . 33 ± 0 . 15 ; n = 12 ) . GFP - NHERF2 was enriched near the plasma membrane but also localized to a fraction of  2 AR - containing endosomes ( Fig . 2 C , bottom ) . The fluorescence in - tensity of GFP - NHERF2 on endosomes was not high , however ( Pearson’s coefficient = 0 . 29 ± 0 . 15 ; n = 12 ) , and GFP - NHERF2 colocalization was visible only when  2 ARs were also present ( Fig . S1 B , second row from the top , compare left and right image pairs ) . SNX27 - GFP was unique in localizing prominently to en - dosomes either in the absence or presence of  2 ARs ( Fig . S1 B , bottom two rows ) . The SNX27 - associated endosomes colocal - ized extensively with EEA1 ( Fig . 2 D , top ; 92 % overlap , 4 , 119 endosomes , 54 cells , three experiments ; Pearson’s coefficient = 0 . 60 ± 0 . 14 ; n = 28 images ) . In contrast , we observed little GFP - tagged version of SNX27a in the FLAG -  2 AR – expressing HEK293 cell clone used for trafficking studies . We then ex - posed these cells to 10 µM isoproterenol for 25 min in the pres - ence of Alexa Flour – conjugated M1 anti - FLAG monoclonal antibody to drive fluorescently tagged  2 ARs to steady state throughout the recycling pathway ( Gage et al . , 2001 ) . SNX27 - GFP localized prominently to endosomal membranes , as shown previously ( Joubert et al . , 2004 ; Lunn et al . , 2007 ; Rincón et al . , 2007 ) , and a large fraction of these endosomes contained in - ternalized  2 ARs ( Fig . 2 C , top ) . We quantified this observa - tion by counting the number of  2 AR - containing endosomes colocalized with SNX27 in coded specimens ( 90 % overlap , 8 , 586 endosomes , 124 cells , three experiments ) . We addition - ally verified extensive overlap by determining Pearson’s cor - relation coefficient between the respective image channels ( 0 . 62 ± 0 . 09 , n = 12 images ) . In contrast , GFP - tagged NHERF1 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm with visible enrichment Figure 3 .

To further verify the specificity of the SNX27 knock - down effect , we investigated rescue using rat - derived SNX27 constructs not targeted by the human - specific siRNA duplexes . Selective knockdown and replacement were confirmed by anti - SNX27 immunoblotting ( Fig . 4 A ) . Both a and b isoforms of SNX27 , which differ by alternative splicing affecting the C - terminal 15 residues ( Kajii et al . , 2003 ) , effectively rescued  2 AR recycling , whereas control expression of GFP did not ( Fig . 4 B ) . We also verified rescue of net surface receptor immuno - reactivity when measured at steady state in the absence of ag - onist ( unpublished data ) . Gating the flow cytometric analysis according to GFP signal ( Fig . 4 C ) further verified transgenic rescue of  2 AR recycling by both SNX27 isoforms over a range of expression levels ( Fig . 4 D ) . We next asked if the recycling activity of SNX27 requires its ability to bind the PDZ motif present in the  2 AR tail . To do so , we mutated a single conserved histidine residue present in the second  helix of the SNX27 PDZ domain ( position 112 in rat SNX27 corresponds to position 114 in human , highlighted in red in Fig . 2 A ) , which is predicted to form a critical hydro - gen bond with the Ser / Thr residue located at the  2 position of the PDZ - interacting motif ( corresponding to S411 of the human  2 AR ; Doyle et al . , 1996 ; Tonikian et al . , 2008 ) . This point mu - tation destabilized binding of SNX27 to the  2 AR - derived sort - ing motif ( Fig . 5 A ) , and did so to a similarly large degree as mutating the PDZ motif itself ( compare to Fig . 2 B ) . Using cir - cular dichroism and gel filtration , we ruled out changes in PDZ fold stability or oligomerization state as an explanation for this result ( unpublished data ) . Further , the H112A mutation did not overlap with LAMP3 or with Rab11 ( Fig . 2 D , middle and bot - tom ; Pearson’s coefficient = 0 . 38 ± 0 . 16 [ n = 28 ] and 0 . 25 ± 0 . 10 [ n = 27 ] ) . These observations define the SNX27 - associated membrane compartments primarily as early endosomes . We next applied RNA interference to test the functional significance of candidate PDZ proteins when knocked down individually ( Fig . 3 A ) . Consistent with the dual - knockdown results , depletion of NHERF1 did not significantly affect  2 AR recycling ( Fig . 3 B , compare first and second bars from the left ) . Depletion of NHERF2 produced a significant inhibition of  2 AR recycling , but the magnitude of this effect was small ( Fig . 3 B , third bar from the left ) . Depletion of SNX27 , in contrast , caused a pronounced inhibition of  2 AR recycling ( Fig . 3 B , rightmost bar ) that was similar in magnitude to the effect of disrupting the cis - acting PDZ motif itself (  2 AR - Ala mutant receptor ; Fig . 1 D ) . Pronounced inhibition of  2 AR re - cycling in SNX27 - depleted cells was further verified by visual inspection of epifluorescence micrographs ( Fig . S1 C ) . SNX27 knockdown increased net receptor internalization measured at a steady state , which is consistent with the ability of  2 ARs to repeatedly endocytose and recycle in the continu - ous presence of an agonist ( von Zastrow and Kobilka , 1992 ) . Kinetic analysis indicated that increased net receptor internal - ization was accounted for by the reduced fractional recycling of receptors ( F r ) produced by SNX27 depletion ( Figs . 3 C and S2 C ) . Also supporting this interpretation , surface biotinylation and immunoblot analysis established that SNX27 knockdown increased agonist - induced proteolysis of the  2 AR ( Fig . 3 , D and E ) . Further , SNX27 depletion produced a net down - regulation of surface and total cellular receptor number mea - sured by fluorescence flow cytometry and a radioligand binding assay , respectively , in cells maintained in the absence of agonist ( Fig . S2 , A and B ) . All of these observations are consistent with Figure 4 . Transgenic rescue of  2 AR re­ cycling by recombinant SNX27 .

However , the H112A mutant SNX27 was unable to rescue  2 AR recycling ( Fig . 5 C , middle two bars ) . We also asked if SNX27’s sorting activity requires its associa - tion with the endosome membrane . To do so , we used a mutant version of SNX27a possessing a wild - type PDZ domain but lacking the PX domain ( SNX27  PX ) . SNX27  PX failed to localize to endocytic vesicles ( Fig . 5 B , bottom ; Pearson’s co - efficient = 0 . 19 ± 0 . 12 ; n = 20 images ) and did not rescue the recycling defect caused by depletion of endogenous SNX27 ( Fig . 5 C , rightmost bar ) . Together , these results indicate that the recycling activity of SNX27 requires both PDZ motif bind - ing and direct association with the endosome membrane . As an independent test of the specificity of SNX27 for PDZ - directed recycling , we examined the effect of replacing the PDZ motif present in the  2 AR cytoplasmic tail with a dis - tinct 17 - residue sequence derived from the cytoplasmic tail of the  opioid neuropeptide receptor ( Fig . S3 A ) . This µ receptor – derived recycling sequence ( mrs ) does not conform to a PDZ motif , and does not bind PDZ domains in vitro , but represents a PDZ - independent sorting motif that is sufficient to direct ef - ficient recycling when substituted for the PDZ motif present in the wild - type  2 AR ( Tanowitz and von Zastrow , 2003 ) .  2 - mrs recycling was insensitive to SNX27 knockdown ( Fig . 5 D ) . SNX27 depletion also did not increase agonist - induced degradation of  2 - mrs ( Fig . S3 , B and C ) . We further verified SNX27’s localization and discrete sorting activity in a physiologically relevant cell type . SNX27 colocalized extensively with  2 AR - containing endosomes in aortic smooth muscle ( A10 ) cells ( Fig . 5 E ; Pearson’s coefficient = 0 . 58 ± 0 . 10 ; n = 6 ) . Knock - down of endogenous SNX27 in these cells inhibited recycling of the  2 AR , but not the  2 - mrs engineered receptor . Finally , this specific knockdown effect was rescued by recombinant SNX27 ( Fig . 5 F ) . Together , we believe that the present results provide sev - eral lines of evidence indicating that SNX27 is a critical sorting protein for PDZ motif – directed endosome - to - plasma membrane traffic , and that it mediates this sorting function directly from the endosome membrane . We note that the presently described function of SNX27 in PDZ - directed recycling is fundamentally different from the previously proposed roles of SNX27 in pro - moting endocytosis or lysosomal delivery of PDZ motif – bearing cargo ( Joubert et al . , 2004 ; Lunn et al . , 2007 ) . These previous studies relied entirely on the effects of SNX27 overexpression , and , consistent with this , we observed some agonist - independent accumulation of  2 ARs in endosomes when SNX27 - GFP was overexpressed ( Fig . S1 B , agonist - naive condition is shown in the bottom two rows ) . Depleting native SNX27 produced a much more pronounced retention of receptors in endosomes , how - ever , which was evident under both agonist - induced ( Fig . S2 C ) and - naive ( Fig . S1 C ) conditions . Thus , although SNX27 over - expression can indeed produce additional effects consistent with expression - dependent differences in the functional effects of other sorting nexins ( Carlton et al . , 2005 ) , we are confident that a primary function of SNX27 expressed endogenously is to promote PDZ motif – directed recycling from ( rather than se - questration in ) endosomes . This function of SNX27 is also different from the roles of all other sorting nexins established previously . Sorting nexins are known to have a variety of effects on endocytic membrane organization and function , and several possess Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) domains that detect or impose membrane curvature . SNX27 lacks a recognized BAR domain , is the only known family member containing a PDZ domain , and , except for its PX domain , is largely distinct from other sorting nexins . It is interesting to note that sorting nexin 17 ( SNX17 ) , although it lacks a PDZ domain , shares homology with SNX27 elsewhere ( Xu et al . , 2001 ) and has been found to promote recycling of the low - density lipoprotein receptor – related protein ( LRP ) by interacting with a tyrosine - based sequence distinct from a PDZ motif ( van Kerkhof et al . , 2005 ) . SNX27 could potentially func - tion via PDZ - dependent inhibition of receptor interaction with the lysosomal sorting machinery or , alternatively , by promoting PDZ - directed packaging of receptors into recycling vesicles . The present data cannot distinguish these possibilities , but set the essential groundwork for further mechanistic elucidation of SNX27’s discrete sorting activity . We focused here on trafficking of the  2 AR because this was the integral membrane protein for which the hypothesis of PDZ - directed recycling was first proposed ( Cao et al . , 1999 ) , because endosome - to - plasma membrane trafficking of this re - ceptor is well established to have physiologically significant effects ( Moore et al . , 2007 ) , and because there is emerging evi - dence that the PDZ - dependent recycling mechanism is conversely regulated by  2 AR signaling ( Yudowski et al . , 2009 ) . We note that several other signaling receptors have been found to exhibit PDZ motif – dependent recycling ( Wente et al . , 2005 ; Delhaye et al . , 2007 ; Hanyaloglu and von Zastrow , 2008 ) . Further , PDZ domain – mediated protein interactions are recognized to func - tion more widely in determining the endomembrane traffick - ing of various membrane proteins ( e . g . , Lin and Huganir , 2007 ; on M a y 29 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 23 , 2010 JCB • VOLUME 190 • NUMBER 4 • 2010 572 obtained from GE Healthcare ( anti – mouse and anti – rabbit IgG ) and Pierce ( anti – goat IgG ) . Cell culture and transfection Human embryonic kidney 293 cells and A10 aortic smooth muscle cells ( American Type Culture Collection ) were maintained in DME supple - mented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( University of California , San Fran - cisco Cell Culture Facility ) . NHERF - deficient PS120 cells were provided by M . Donowitz ( Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , MD ) . For siRNA trans - fection , cells at  30 % confluency in 6 - cm dishes were transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMax ( Invitrogen ) and 40 pmol of siRNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions , split into 12 - well plates 48 h after transfec - tion , and assayed at 72 h after transfection . For cotransfection of DNA and siRNA , Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) was used with 40 pmol siRNA and  2 µg DNA in the same plating format and recommended protocol . DNA transfection was performed in 6 - well or 12 - well plates at  50 % cell conflu - ency using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instruc - tions . Stably transfected cells were selected in 500 µg / ml Geneticin ( Life Technologies ) , and cell clones expressing FLAG - tagged receptor constructs were chosen at similar levels based on mean surface immunofluorescence / cell measured through flow cytometry , and found to have at least 90 % of cells expressing surface immunoreactivity . Radioligand binding assay ( performed as described in the next paragraph ) verified that total receptor expression in each clone was in the range of 2 – 4 pmol / mg protein . Radioligand binding assays A single - point radioligand binding assay to estimate total receptor ex - pression was performed using a minor variation of a previously de - scribed method ( von Zastrow and Kobilka , 1992 ) . In brief , cells plated in 6 - well dishes were washed with PBS , exposed to one cycle of freezing (  20°C ) and thawing , and mechanically resuspended in 200 µl PBS . Equal amounts of cell lysate ( 50 – 100 µg total protein as determined by a Bradford assay ) were aliquoted into 96 - well plates and brought to a total volume of 100 µl PBS including 11 . 5 nM [ 3 H ] dihydroalprenolol ( GE Healthcare ) , a saturating concentration used to estimate B max . Each lysate was assayed in triplicate , and nonspecific binding was determined by including 10 µM of unlabeled alprenolol ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with shaking , and membranes were harvested by filtration binding through glass fiber ( GF / C ; GE Health - care ) using a vacuum - driven harvester ( Filtermate 196 ; Packard Instru - ments ) . Filters were washed extensively with 20 mM Tris Cl , pH 7 . 5 , and bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting ( Tri - Carb 2100TR ; Packard Instruments ) . Fluorescence polarization assays Wild - type and H112A mutant PDZ domains derived from SNX27 , cloned in pBH4 , were transformed into E . coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) pLYS - S for ex - pression , and recombinant proteins were purified using a Ni 2 + - NTA ( QIA - GEN ) column . Proteins were further purified on a 16 / 60 Sephacryl S - 100 gel filtration column ( GE ) run in 20 mM Hepes / 100 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 4 . The purified proteins were concentrated to 600 – 800 µM , frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at  80°C . Concentrations were determined using the Bradford method . The binding of the N - terminal fluorescein - labeled peptides ( TNDSLL and TNDSLLA ) was monitored by following the in - crease in fluorescence polarization upon titration of the concentrated PDZ domain . The assay was performed in 384 - well plates containing 10 nM of labeled peptide in each well . The experiments were performed in 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , and 20 mM DTT at room temperature . Fluorescence polarization was measured using an Analyst HT Fluorom - eter ( Molecular devices ) with excitation and emission set to 485 nm and 530 nm , respectively ( Harris et al . , 2001 ) . Fluorescence microscopy To assess localization of  2 ARs , PDZ proteins , and / or endosomal markers in HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG - tagged  2 AR , cells were trans - fected with siRNA or constructs encoding GFP - tagged PDZ protein where appropriate . 48 h later , agonist - naive cells were incubated in the pres - ence of Alexa Fluor 647 – conjugated M1 anti - FLAG antibody ( 10 µg / ml ) or rabbit anti - FLAG antibody ( 2 µg / ml ) for 20 min to selectively label  2 ARs present in the plasma membrane . To label the internalized receptor pool , cells were subsequently incubated for 25 min in the presence of 10 µM isoproterenol , a condition that is sufficient to drive labeled  2 ARs to steady state in the recycling pathway . Cells were then quickly washed with cold PBS and fixed in 4 % formaldehyde / PBS for 10 min at room tempera - ture , followed by a Tris - buffered saline quench for 5 min . Cells were then permeabilized where needed for 20 min in 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 and 5 % Cushing et al . , 2008 ; Maday et al . , 2008 ; Wieman et al . , 2009 ) . We also note that the general concept of sequence - directed molecular sorting in the recycling pathway is now firmly estab - lished , particularly in polarized cell types ( Mellman and Nelson , 2008 ) . The molecular basis of such sorting has been studied most extensively in epithelial cells , where non - PDZ interactions of membrane cargo with AP - 1B promote basolateral surface de - livery involving Rab8 and components of the exocyst ( Fölsch et al . , 1999 , 2003 ; Gan et al . , 2002 ; Ang et al . , 2003 ) , and where such sorting has been shown to occur in recycling endosomes ( Ang et al . , 2004 ) . We believe that the present study , by estab - lishing SNX27 as a mediator of PDZ motif – directed recycling from the early endosome membrane , significantly extends the concept of molecular sorting in the recycling pathway and sup - ports its physiological significance . Materials and methods Constructs and specialized reagents Epitope - tagged receptor constructs have been described previously ( von Zastrow and Kobilka , 1992 ; Cao et al . , 1999 ; Tanowitz and von Zastrow , 2003 ) . GFP - NHERF1 was generated from a previously described HA - tagged version of human EBP50 / NHERF1 ( Cao et al . , 1999 ) . The cod - ing sequence was subcloned from pcDNA3 . 0 ( Invitrogen ) into pEGFP - C3 ( Clontech ) using XmnI and HindIII , and the C - terminal HA tag was removed by introduction of a stop codon using oligonucleotide site - directed muta - genesis ( QuikChange ; Agilent Technologies ) . GFP - NHERF2 was generated by PCR from a cDNA encoding human NHERF2 / E3KARP ( No . 5296143 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . SNX27 - GFP was generated from rat SNX27 / mrt1 ( isoform a , GenBank / EMBL / DDBJ accession No . NM _ 001110151 , obtained from American Type Culture Collection ) subcloned into pENTR . D . TOPO ( Invitrogen ) . GFP tagging was accomplished by recombination into pcDNA - DEST47 ( Gateway system ; Invitrogen ) . The b isoform and the H112A mutant version were generated from SNX27 - GFP using oligo - nucleotide site - directed mutagenesis . The  PX construct ( deleting residues 162 – 263 ) was constructed using stitch PCR of the flanking sequence and insertion into the pENTR . D . TOPO vector followed by recombination into the pcDNA - DEST47 vector . For production of recombinant protein in E . coli , wild type or H112A mutant SNX27 PDZ domain ( corresponding to residues 39 – 131 in the NM _ 001110151 coding sequence ) were ampli - fied by PCR and inserted using NcoI and XhoI sites to a pET19b - derived ex - pression vector ( pBH4 ) incorporating an N - terminal His 6 tag . All constructs were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing ( Elim Biopharmaceuticals , Inc . ) . Control ( nonsilencing ) and silencing siRNAs were obtained from the HP GenomeWide siRNA collection ( QIAGEN ) . The sense - strand , silencing siRNA sequences are as follows : NHERF1 , 5  - GAAGGAGAACAGUC - GUGAA ( dTdT ) - 3  ; NHERF2 , 5  - GAGACAGAUGAACACUUCA ( dTdT ) - 3  ; and SNX27 , 5  - CCAGGUAAUUGCAUUUGAA ( dTdT ) - 3  . SNX27 silenc - ing in rat A10 cells was accomplished with a mix of the four siRNAs available for that species commercially ( HP GenomeWide siRNA collec - tion , QIAGEN ) . To verify specific rescue in rat A10 cells , knockdown was achieved using 5  - GACCAAGUGUACCAGGCUA ( dTdT ) - 3  targeting en - dogenous SNX27 , and this target sequence was removed from the SNX27 rescue construct by synonymous mutation ( GTGTAC → GTATAT , nucleo - tides 1012 – 1017 of NM _ 001110151 ) . Peptides corresponding to the C - terminal six residues of the  2AR ( TNDSLL ) and an alanine - extended version ( TNDSLLA ) , labeled at the N terminus with fluorescein ( FITC ) , were obtained from Genemed Synthesis . Monoclonal anti - FLAG antibody ( M1 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) was conjugated with Alexa Fluor dyes ( Invitrogen ) accord - ing to the manufacturer’s instructions . Alexa Fluor – conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from the same vendor . The dilutions and sources of other primary antibodies used were : 1 : 500 rabbit anti - FLAG ( Sigma - Aldrich ) ; 1 : 1 , 000 rabbit anti - EBP50 ( ab3452 ; Abcam ) ; 1 : 100 goat anti - NHERF2 ( sc - 21117 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) ; 1 : 500 mouse anti - EEA1 ( 610457 ; BD ) ; 1 : 500 mouse anti - LAMP3 / CD63 ( H5C6 ; Devel - opmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , University of Iowa ) ; and 1 : 100 rabbit anti - Rab11 ( 71 – 5300 ; Invitrogen ) . Anti - SNX27 mouse monoclonal IgG was generated using residues 1 – 267 of hSNX27 ( Joubert et al . , 2004 ) and used at a 1 : 1 , 000 dilution . HRP - coupled M2 antibody ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was used for receptor Westerns . HRP - coupled secondary antibodies were on M a y 29 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 23 , 2010 573 PDZ - directed recycling from early endosomes • Lauffer et al . in TBST containing 5 % milk or BSA ( anti - NHERF2 ) . Immunoreactive species were identified using HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1 : 3 , 000 ) or HRP - conjugated M2 antibody ( 1 : 500 ) followed by chemiluminescence detection ( SuperSignal ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Exposures were captured using x - ray film or , for quantitative assessment , using a FluorChem 8000 luminescence imaging system ( Cell Biosciences ) . Statistical and kinetic analysis In flow cytometric assays , mean fluorescence / cell of duplicate or triplicate collections of cells were used to calculate relative changes in basal surface receptor expression , agonist - induced internalization , and recycling effi - ciency for each independent experiment . Integrated densities of receptor – antibody – HRP luminescence in individual samples from biotin degradation immunoblots were similarly normalized to the indicated reference for each independent experiment . Data were collected as replicates in a Prism spreadsheet for statistical and graphing analysis ( GraphPad Software , Inc . ) . Replicate values were compared with the given reference using a Student’s t test or paired t test as indicated in the figure legends . Curve fit - ting of internalization and recycling time courses used replicate percent - ages over the multiple time points indicated to generate rate constants according to a two - compartment endocytic recycling model . The rate of re - cycling was described by recycling % = F r ( 1  e  krt ) and the internalization kinetics were described by F SR = [ F r k r + k e × e  ( ke + Fr kr ) t ] / [ ke + Fr kr ] , where F r is the recycling efficiency or maximum fraction recycled , k r is the re - cycling rate constant , t is the time in minutes , F SR is the fraction of surface receptor remaining , and k e is the endocytic rate constant . Fitting of tripli - cate fluorescence polarization values of peptides to increasing concentra - tions of PDZ protein using a single binding site model have been described previously ( Harris et al . , 2001 ) .

A10 cells were transfected with receptor constructs and additional oligonucleotide as indicated , and labeled for FLAG - tagged receptors similarly . Surface - accessible Alexa Fluor 647 – conjugated M1 antibody was further labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 – conjugated anti – mouse IgG at 4°C before fixation . Fixed specimens were mounted to glass slides in Fluormount - G ( SouthernBiotech ) and examined at room temperature . Laser - scanning confocal microscopy was performed using a microscope ( LSM510 ; Carl Zeiss , Inc . ) fitted with a 63× / NA 1 . 4 oil objective lens . Wide - field ( epifluorescence ) microscopy was performed using a micro - scope ( Diaphot ; Nikon ) equipped with a 60× / NA 1 . 4 oil objective lens , mercury arc lamp , standard dichroic filter sets ( Chroma Technology Corp . ) , and a 12 - bit cooled charge - coupled device camera ( MicroMax ; Princeton Instruments ) interfaced to a computer running MetaMorph acquisition and analysis software ( MDS Analytical Technologies ) . Wide - field images were rendered using ImageJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ; Collins , 2007 ) and confocal images were rendered using LSM software ( Carl Zeiss , Inc . ) . Illus - trations were prepared using Photoshop and Illustrator software ( Adobe ) . Background subtraction and scaling were performed using nonsaturated images and linear lookup tables . Colocalization analysis was assessed in confocal optical sections in two ways . First , independent scoring of positive structures in SNX27 , EEA1 , or receptor channels was done visually , with manual counting . Positive structures were defined by fluorescence intensity at least three standard deviations above background and encompassing contiguous pixels representing at least 500 nm . Degree of overlap was cal - culated from individual images and averaged over the indicated number of specimens selected at random . Second , colocalization was estimated by calculating the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the indicated image channels using the Manders _ Coefficients . java plugin for ImageJ ( T . Collins and W . Rasband , Wright Cell Imaging Facility , Toronto Western Research Institute , and National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . Fluorescence flow cytometry Internalization and recycling of FLAG - tagged receptor constructs was as - sessed using Alexa Fluor 647 – conjugated M1 anti - FLAG antibody and a FACSCalibur flow cytometer ( BD ) as described previously ( Hanyaloglu and von Zastrow , 2007 ) . Internalization was determined by reduction of surface receptor immunoreactivity observed after incubation of cells in the presence of the adrenergic agonist isoproterenol ( 10 µM ) for the indicated number of minutes at 37°C . Recycling in HEK293 cells was determined by recovery of surface receptor immunoreactivity measured after a 25 - min exposure to isoproterenol and a subsequent agonist - removal incubation ( 50 min unless indicated otherwise ) in the presence of the adrenergic an - tagonist alprenolol ( 10 µM ) to prevent any residual agonist effects ( cor - responding to the ALP segment in Fig . 1 C ) . Analysis of recycling data according to the level of recombinant SNX27 expression was performed using dual - channel flow cytometry in cells transiently transfected with the indicated version of SNX27 - GFP , also as described previously ( Lauffer et al . , 2009 ) . Recycling in A10 smooth muscle cells was evaluated by internalizing Alexa Fluor 647 – conjugated M1 antibody with receptors as described above for microscopy experiments , and determining internal receptor fluorescence loss after a 50 - min agonist withdrawal incubation and subsequent cell dissociation ( TrypLE trypsin replacement buffer ; Invitrogen ) at 4°C to retain internalized fluorescent antibodies while removing surface - accessible ones . Each experiment used duplicate or triplicate determina - tions of 2 – 10 , 000 cells each , and results shown represent the receptor recycling in cells transfected with negative control siRNA minus that seen in cells transfected with SNX27 siRNA . Western blot analysis To assess knockdown efficiency , duplicate wells from the indicated analysis performed in a 12 - well plate were combined and solubilized in 200 µl of lysis buffer : 0 . 1 % ( vol / vol ) Triton X - 100 , 150 mM NaCl , 25 mM KCl , 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , and complete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 20 , 000 g in a micro - centrifuge , the protein concentration of extracts was determined using a Bradford assay , and equal protein loads were mixed 3 : 1 with 4× LDS sample buffer ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 5 %  - mercaptoethanol be - fore heating to 95°C for 5 min . Biotin - labeled , GPCR degradation assays have been described previously ( Gage et al . , 2001 ) , and were used here for isolation of mature receptor via surface protein biotinylation , streptavidin - agarose precipitation , and anti - FLAG immunoblotting . Protein samples from these experiments were reduced and denatured at 37°C for 1 h . The solubilized extracts were separated by SDS - PAGE , transferred to nitro - cellulose , and Ponceau S stained to verify equal loading before immuno - blotting .

( A ) Representative dual - channel epifluorescence micrographs showing the localization of GFP - NHERF1 and FLAG -  2 AR in a focal plane near the base of the cell . ( B ) Representative epifluorescence micrographs showing localization of the indicated GFP - tagged PDZ - directed recycling from early endosomes • Lauffer et al . S3 PDZ proteins relative to agonist - naive ( left ) and agonist - internalized ( right ) FLAG -  2 AR observed in a focal plane near the middle of cells . Arrowheads indi - cate examples of receptor - containing endosomes . ( C ) Stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing FLAG -  2 AR were transfected with nonsilencing negative control or SNX27 - silencing siRNA . FLAG -  2 AR localization in representative cells is shown , as visualized by epifluorescence microscopy using a mid - focal plane . ( C , left ) SNX27 depletion produced a partial but clearly visible increase in internal FLAG -  2 AR immunoreactivity in agonist - naive cells ( compare top and bottom images ) , which is consistent with a low level of constitutive ( agonist - independent ) endocytosis of receptors and impaired recycling in SNX27 - depleted cells . ( C , middle ) SNX27 depletion did not detectably impair isoproterenol - induced internalization of FLAG -  2 AR . ( C , right ) SNX27 depletion produced a visually obvious reduction in FLAG -  2 AR recycling after agonist washout , effectively preventing the internalized receptor pool from returning to the plasma membrane and thereby further verifying the primary recycling defect established quantitatively by flow cytometry . , Bars , 10 µm . JCB S4 Figure S2 . Effects of PDZ protein knockdown on steady - state receptor expression and internalization . ( A ) Effect of the indicated PDZ protein knockdown on steady - state surface expression of FLAG -  2 AR ( bars on the left ) and FLAG -  2 AR - Ala ( bars on the right ) was assessed by fluorescence flow cytometry . HEK293 cells expressing the indicated receptor construct were transfected with the indicated siRNA and assessed for surface receptor immunoreactivity by anti - FLAG surface staining and flow cytometry 72 h later . Data are normalized to the surface receptor measured in the same cell clone transfected with nonsilencing negative control RNA duplex . Error bars reflect the SEM of at least four experiments , and p - values of a Student’s t test between the surface receptor to negative control - treated cells are shown . ( B ) The effect of SNX27 knockdown on total cellular receptor density of FLAG -  2 AR measured by radioligand binding . FLAG -  2 AR – expressing HEK293 cells were mock - transfected ( left ) , transfected with nonsilencing negative control siRNA ( middle ) , or transfected with SNX27 siRNA ( right ) , and total cellular receptor expression was estimated by B max determination using the membrane - permeant radioligand dihydroalprenolol , as described in Materials and methods , 72 h later . Error bars indicate SEM ( n = 6 ) , and p - values shown are results of a Student’s t test relative to the mock - transfected condition . ( C ) Flow cytometric analysis of isoproterenol - induced FLAG -  2 AR internalization in cells depleted of the indicated PDZ protein . Data were incorporated into a two - compartment model reflecting simultaneous endocytosis and fractional recycling , assuming first order kinetics for each process , as specified as an equation in the figure and further described in Materials and methods . The recycling rate constant ( k r ) and maximum fraction of recycled receptor ( F r ) were derived from experiments shown in Fig . 3 , in which recycling was measured in the absence of receptor endocytosis . Endocytic rate constants ( k e ) were calculated by iterative best - fit analysis performed using GraphPad Prism software . The inset table shows a summary of the kinetic parameters determined for each condition . Error bars indicate SEM of four experiments . This analysis indicates that SNX27 depletion primarily affected F r . PDZ - directed recycling from early endosomes • Lauffer et al . S5 Figure S3 .
