[ CANCER RESEARCH 55 , 2270 - 2274 , June l , 1W5 ] Advances in Brief The Neurofibromatosis Type 2 Gene Product , Schwannomin , Suppresses Growth of NIH 3T3 Cells1 Mohini Lutchman and Guy A . Rouleau2 Centre for Research in Neitroscietices , Medii University and the Montreal General Hospital , Montreal , Quebec H3G IA4 , Canada Abstract Cancer Â¡sa multistep process that involves the activation of oncogenes and the inactivation of antioncogenes . Recently , a new putative tumor suppressor , the neurofibromatosis type 2 ( NF2 ) gene , was mapped to chromosome 22 , cloned , and found to encode for a new protein , merlin / schwannomin , a member of the band 4 . 1 family of proteins . Members of this family have not been implicated previously in tumorigenesis . They possess significant homology in their MHz - terminal domain , which is thought to be important in the binding of the plasma membrane to the underlying actin cytoskeleton . To determine whether schwannomin may affect cell growth , we transfected NIH 3T3 cells with the wild type and an NF2 cDNA lacking 111 amino acids at the Ml , terminus . We observed slowing of growth and changes in cellular morphology only in cells ex pressing the wild - type NF2 cDNA . This finding suggests that schwan nomin can suppress growth directly and confirms its role in tumor sup pression . This system will provide a useful assay to identify important functional domains of the protein . Introduction NF23 is an autosomal dominant disease that predisposes patients to the development of vestibular schwannomas , meningiomas , and other tumors of the neuroectoderm ( 1 ) . The gene was mapped to chromo some 22 ( 2 ) , and more recently it was cloned ( 3 , 4 ) and found to encode a protein , SCH , which is a new member of the band 4 . 1 family of proteins . This family includes numerous structural proteins such as ezrin , radixin , and moesin , as well as enzymes such as the protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPH1 and PTPMEG ( 5 ) . Protein band 4 . 1 is an important structural protein that plays a key role in regulating membrane physical properties , including mechanical stability and deformability , by stabilizing spectrin - ankyrin interaction ( 6 ) . Ezrin , radixin , and moesin appear to be expressed widely but have been found to localize to various subcellular compartments ( 7 - 9 ) . Ezrin ( or cytovillin ) is a microvillar cytoplasmic peripheral membrane protein , with prominent expression in placenta ! syncytiotrophoblasts and cer tain human tumors ( 10 ) . Radixin is an actin - barbed end - capping protein that is highly concentrated in the undercoat of the cell - cell adherens junction and the cleavage furrow of cells in the interphase and mitotic phases ( 8 , 11 ) . Moesin is a membrane - organizing exten sion spike protein that is localized in cultured cells near the plasma membrane especially in microspikes , retraction fibers , blebs , filopo - dia , and lamellopodia ( 7 , 12 ) . These proteins are all involved in maintaining the focal contact points between the plasma membrane and cytoskeleton . It has been postulated that certain proteins in this class may act as tumor suppressor genes ( 13 ) . Received 2 / 15 / 95 ; accepted 4 / 20 / 95 .

Many lines of evidence support the hypothesis that SCH is a tumor suppressor . NF2 shares many features with retinoblastoma , the para digm for a genetic disease caused by mutation of a tumor suppressor ( 14 ) . These include autosomal dominant mode of inheritance , inacti vation of germline mutations , and the occurrence of multiple tumors at a young age . In sporadic and A ' F2 - associated meningiomas and schwannomas , loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 22 and a high frequency of inactivating mutations of the NF2 gene strongly support the hypothesis that SCH is a tumor suppressor ( 3 , 4 , 15 - 25 ) . To determine whether SCH can suppress growth , we transfected the gene into NIH 3T3 cells in culture . SCH expression significantly slowed growth and caused morphological changes . Transfection with a mutant NF2 gene isolated from an NF2 patient did not cause any phenotypic changes . These results confirm that SCH can act as a tumor suppressor . This system will allow the dissection of key SCH domains . Materials and Methods RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription - PCR . The following cell lines were analyzed for NF2 mRNA : P19 embryonic carcinoma cells ; NG108 and SH5Y human neuroblastoma cells ; and NIH 3T3 Swiss mouse fibroblasts . Total RNA was isolated with the use of the GIBCO - BRL ( Gaithersburg , MD ) TRIzol reagent from 2 X Iff cells and was reverse transcribed for l h at 37Â°C with the use of primer 906 ( GCAGAATATCCAGAGCTGTCTC ) . Primers 840 ( TGCTTGCTTGGAGTGGATG ) and 906 were then used for PCR am plification [ 94Â°Cfor 2 min ( hot start ) and the addition of Taq polymerase , followed by 94Â°Cfor 1 min , 55Â°Cfor 30 s , and 72Â°Cfor 2 min , for 30 cycles ] . The product was visualized on a 1 % agarose gel . Transfection of Mouse Fibroblasts ( NIH 3T3 Cells ) . The full - length 2046 - bp wild - type cDNA was subcloned into the EcnRl site of the pcDNAHI expression vector ( Invitrogen , San Diego , CA ) . The construct was cotrans - fected with the ÃŸ - galactosidase gene into NIH 3T3 Swiss mouse fibroblasts that were cultured to 70 % confluency . The GIBCO - BRL lipofectamine system was used for transfection . A mock transfection was achieved with the use of the pcDNAIII vector alone . The cells were allowed to recover for 2 days after transfection , and at least 2 X 10 ' ' cells were used to extract RNA for reverse transcription - PCR and protein for Western analysis . The transfection effi ciency was determined with the use of X - galactosidase staining . For develop ment of a stably transfected cell line , 800 fig / ml of G418 ( Geneticin ; GIBCO - BRL ) were used in the selection protocol over a period of 2 months . Effect of Antisense Oligonucleotides . An antisense oligonucleotide ( GGAAGCGATGGCCCGGCCAG ) from the 5 ' end of the gene and crossing the ATG was tested in cell lines transfected stably with the wild - type NF2 gene and then observed for reversal of the growth changes . The same experiment was carried out using 80 JAMof the sense oligonucleotide ( CCTCCCTAC - CGGGCCGGTC ) in 3 - h pulses every day for 6 days . Growth rate and thymi - dine uptake were assessed in treated cells . Effect of Epidermal Growth Factor on NF2 Stable Transfectants . Ap proximately 2 X IO6cells were plated in 10 - cm tissue culture plates and grown in serum - free medium for fibroblasts ( GIBCO - BRL ) in the presence and absence of 100 nM EGF . EGF at this concentration is known to stimulate growth rate ( 26 ) . The cells undergoing the different treatment were plated in triplicate . Morphological changes in the cells were assessed , and growth rate , thymidine uptake , and protein content ( 27 ) were measured . Characteristics of the SCH protein were investigated by Western blotting . 2270 on May 3 , 2017 . © 1995 American Association for Cancer Research . cancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from SCHWANNOMIN SUPPRESSES GROWTH Ã¤2S * t | Sw & - Â § g Â» - 1 . 4 kb Fig .

This observation was also confirmed by Northern blotting analysis ( data not shown ) . Western Blots of Cell Lysates . The polyclonal antiserum used in this assay has been characterized previously . 4 Cell lysates were collected from cultured cells by pelleting by centrifugation at 2500 rpm in a clinical centrifuge and then resuspcnding the pellet in 200 ml of NP40 buffer as described previously . Total protein extracted was quantified against a BSA standard . Equal volumes of protein ( 10 p . g ) were loaded in duplicate on 8 and 10 % denaturing polyacrylamide gels electrophoresed at 100 mV for 1 h . After this time one gel was stained with Coomassie and the other was blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane for l h at 4Â°C . The gel was checked to ensure that the protein had transferred with the use of Ponceau - S staining ( Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) . The membrane was preblocked for l h at room temper ature in TBS - 10 % milk - 0 . 5 % Tween , and then the SCH polyclonal antiserum was bound to the membrane for l h at room temperature ( 28 ) . The filter was then washed once for 15 min and 3 times for 5 min at room temperature in TBS - 5 % milk and then bound to the goat anti - rabbit horseradish peroxidase ( Sigma ) secondary antibody for l h at room temperature . This was followed by one 15 - min wash in TBS - 5 % milk - 0 . 05 % Tween , three 5 - min washes in the same solution , followed finally by two 5 - min washes in TBS . The signal was visualized with the use of the Amersham Enhanced Chemilumincscence ( ECL ; Amersham , United Kingdom ) technique ( see manufacturer ' s protocol ) . Immunofluorescence of Cultured Cells . Cells in log phase were trypsinized and plated onto 2 - mm Corning glass coverslips . The cells were incubated overnight and then fixed with cold acetone ( BDH , Germany ) for 1 min . They were rinsed twice for 5 min at room temperature in IX TBS [ 25 mM TBS ( 8g NaCl , 0 . 2 g KO , 3 g Tris + 800 ml H2O ) , pH 7 . 4 ] - 0 . 05 % Tween . Fifty jbil of a solution containing DMEM - 10 % normal goat serum - l : 100 primary SCH antiserum were added to each coverslip and incubated for l h at room temperature . The coverslips were rinsed twice for 5 min in l x TBS at room temperature , and then the secondary antibody , goat anti - rabbit rhodam - ine - conjugatcd antibody , was added at a dilution of 1 : 1 ( MH ) ; the coverslips with cells were incubated for l h at 37Â°C . The coverslips were rinsed twice for 5 min in IX TBS at room temperature and mounted in Immunofluorc ( ICN Biochemicals , Inc . . Cleveland , OH ) mounting fluid . The slides were examined on the Polyvar microscope , and photographs were taken with the use of Tmax 3200 ASA film ( Eastman Kodak Co . . Rochester , NY ) . Measurements of Growth Rate and Thymidine Uptake . Six different clones from each of the untransfected , mock transfccted , and stably transfccted cells ( the wild - type NF2 gene and a deletion mutant ) were grown lo confluency ( 2 X IO6 ) in % - well plates , and during the last 16 h of growth they were subjected to 50 mCi of ( ' H ] thymidine . The cells were blotted onto Whatmann ( Whatmann , Kent , UK ) paper ( triplicate for each ) , put into a 3 - ml volume of scintillation fluid ( Beckman Instruments , Fullerton , CA ) in pony vials , and then counted with the use of a Beckman counter . In separate experiments , untransfected . mock transfected , stably A ' F2 - transfected . and mutant NF2 - transfected NIH 3T3 cells were plated in triplicate with 2 X 10 " cells / well in a 96 - well plate . The cells were counted every 24 h for 5 days with the use of a haemocytometer , and the results were plotted ( Cricket graph ) . Image Analysis and Statistics . Tissue culture dishes containing cultures of the untransfected , mock transfected , and stably transfected NIH 3T3 cells were used for image analysis on an inverted light microscope attached to an IBAS computer ( IBM ) network . Cells ( approximately 50 each ) were selected , and the length of the cell process and the cell body diameters were measured . The ratio was taken and then compared with the use of the Student ' s / test ( 2 - tailed ) , and significance was determined . Results Reverse Transcription - PCR . Reverse transcription - PCR ( Fig . 1 ) was used to test several cell lines for the expression of the NF2 gene product .

P19 ( rat embryonic carcinoma cells ) , PC12 ( mouse pheochromocytoma ) , and NG108 and S5HY ( both are human neuroblastoma cells ) were found to express the NF2 gene at about the same relatively high levels . NIH 3T3 Swiss mouse contact - inhibited cells were found to express the gene at extremely low levels . Therefore , these cells were used for the subsequent experiments . Transfection Experiments . Confluent NIH 3T3 cells were trans fected with the vector only , the full length wild - type NF2 cDNA , or the mutant cDNA as described in " Materials and Methods . " The transfection efficiency was determined to be more than 50 % by cotransfection with the ÃŸ - galactosidasegene . Western analysis using the SCH polyclonal antiserum of the untransfected , wild - type NF2 - transfected , and mutant - transfected cells indicated that the cells ex pressed no , normal , or mutant protein , respectively ( Fig . 2 ) . Overex - pression of SCH in the wild - type / VF2 - transfected cell lines was confirmed by immunofluorescence ( Fig . 3 ) . No distinct phenotypic differences were seen among untransfected cells , mock transfected cells , or cells transfected with the mutant NF2 gene . However , phenotypic changes were seen in cells transfected with the wild - type NF2 gene ( Table 1 ; Fig . 4 ) . There was a 3 - fold decrease in the growth rate ( Fig . 5 ) and morphological changes in the cells . Control cells are flattened and spindle shaped with short filopo - Fig . 4 .

The graph illustrates that there is little difference among the growth rates of the untransfected , mock transfected , and mutant - transfccted ( Mm ) cells . However , the growth rate was slowed almost 3 - fold in the wild - type NF2 - transfected cells . dial extensions . However , transfected cells were round , globular ( re fractive cell bodies ) , and had long processes , which were 5 - 10 times the diameter of the cell body . These changes were reversed by subjecting the stably transfected clones to 80 JUMof an antisense oligonucleotide designed to span the ATO of the NF2 gene . The sense oligonucleotide had no effect . Effect of EGF . Incubation of the stably transfected cell lines with medium containing 100 nMresulted in no changes in cell growth rate or morphology ( data not shown ) . Western analysis showed no change in the size of the protein ( data not shown ) . Discussion The NF2 tumor suppressor gene was cloned recently ( 3 , 4 ) and found to be highly homologous to the band 4 . 1 family ( 29 ) , which encodes proteins involved in interaction of the plasma membrane with the underlying actin cytoskeleton ( 6 , 13 ) . We have now shown that overexpression of the NF2 gene results in decreased growth rate and altered morphology of N1H 3T3 cells . These phenotypic changes were not seen in mock transfected cells or cells transfected with an inacti vated derivative of the NF2 gene . The phenotypic changes in stably transfected cells could be reversed by exposure to an antisense oligo nucleotide designed to inhibit SCH translation . These results confirm that growth suppression results from the overproduction of SCH and provides direct evidence that this protein is a tumor suppressor . Transfection of a deletion mutant failed to induce phenotypic changes . Western analysis showed the presence of a truncated protein of M , 50 , 000 , the expected size given the 111 - amino acid deletion . These results indicate that this mutant protein is inactive . The same mutation causes NF2 in a well studied kindred ( 3 ) , suggesting that our assay might be a useful bioassay for other inactivating NF2 mu tations . This system will allow the rapid assessment of the effects of the missense and internal inframe deletion NF2 mutations on cell function , allowing the identification of key functional domains of SCH . Cells stably transfected with the NF2 gene alter their shape . This may result from interactions between SCH and extracellular matrix molecules via integrins , interactions that may lead to changes in morphology in the actin cytoskeleton . The filopodial extensions sug gest that SCH may play a role in this process , which is frequently seen in terminally differentiating cells . Perhaps SCH is important in the organization and maintenance of myelin sheaths surrounding axons , as well as the dendrites of neurons and the extensions of melanocytes , cell types where SCH is expressed highly . 4 Alternatively , SCH may be involved in the formation of growth cones . Moesin is important in the development of filopodial extensions , which are thought to be important in exploration , attachment , and the movement of cells in vitro , as well as events in epithelial - mesenchymal interactions during oncogenic transformation ( 5 , 9 ) . Transfected cells were incubated in the presence of EGF to see whether there was any change in growth rate or size of the NF2 protein . No significant changes were observed . We conclude that SCH possibly differs from Ezrin where phosphorylation of Tyr 353 permits its translocation from the microvillar core to the membrane in the process of " ruffling of the membrane , " as described by experiments in overexpressing A431 cells treated with EGF ( 26 ) . Further experiments need to be done to determine whether SCH is phosphorylated . We conclude that overexpressing SCH results in a decreased growth rate in NIH 3T3 cells . However , how this novel protein interacts , directly or indirectly , with the cell cycle needs to be deter mined . The observed morphological changes suggest that SCH may be important in exploration and organization of membrane - cytoskel - etal elements . In addition , this cell culture assay provides a means for studying the effects of mutations affecting different functional do mains of SCH . Results of these studies will provide clues to possible interacting molecules such as growth factors , adhesion molecules , cytoskeletal elements , and signaling molecules , all of which may be important to SCH function and tumorigenesis .
