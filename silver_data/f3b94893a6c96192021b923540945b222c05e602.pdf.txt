While the naïve conditions described thus 20 far endow human PSCs with different extents of naivety features , isolating human pluripotent cells 21 that retain characteristics of ground state pluripotency while maintaining differentiation potential 22 and genetic integrity , remains a major challenge . Here we engineer reporter systems that allow 23 functional screening for conditions that can endow both the molecular and functional features 24 expected from human naive pluripotency . We establish that simultaneous inhibition of SRC - NF κ B , 25 WNT / ßCATENIN and PKC signalling pathways is essential for enabling expansion of teratoma 26 competent fully naïve human PSCs in defined or xeno - free conditions . Divergent signalling and 27 transcriptional requirements for maintaining naïve pluripotency were found between mouse and 28 human . Finally , we establish alternative naïve conditions in which MEK / ERK inhibition is 29 substituted with inhibition for NOTCH / RBPj signalling , which allow obtaining alternative human 30 naïve PSCs with diminished risk for loss of imprinting and deleterious global DNA 31 hypomethylation . Our findings set a framework for the signalling foundations of human naïve 32 pluripotency and may advance its utilization in future translational applications . 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 2 Highlights of key findings : 1 2 • Combined inhibition of SRC , WNT and PKC signaling consolidates human naïve pluripotency 3 • Stable expansion of DNA / RNA methylation - independent and TGF / ACTIVIN - independent 4 human naïve PSCs 5 • Opposing roles for ACTIVIN and WNT / ßCATENIN signaling on mouse vs . human naive 6 pluripotency 7 • 2i and MEK / ERKi independent alternative human naïve PSC conditions via inhibiting 8 NOTCH / RBPj signaling 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 3 Introduction 1 A continuum of pluripotent configurations represent changes occurring during in vivo transition 2 of naïve pre - implantation pluripotency toward that of primed post - implantation pluripotent state , can be 3 captured in vitro to various extents ( ( Brons et al . , 2007 ; Hackett and Surani , 2014 ; Nichols and Smith , 4 2009 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ; Weinberger et al . , 2016 ) . Many naïve and primed pluripotency properties can be 5 individually characterized and attributed to pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs ) expanded in distinct conditions . 6 In mice , defined serum free 2i / LIF conditions ( 2 inhibitors of MEK and GSK3 supplemented with LIF ) 7 have been extensively characterized where many naïve molecular and functional properties are endowed 8 by this combination ( Ying et al . , 2008a ) . The latter include global DNA hypomethylation , loss of 9 bivalency over developmental genes ( Marks et al . , 2012 ) , exclusive nuclear localization of TFE3 10 transcription factor ( Betschinger et al . , 2013 ) , tolerance for lack of exogenous L - glutamine ( Carey et al . , 11 2015a ) , tolerance for loss of repressors like DNMT1 , METTL3 and DGCR8 / DICER ( Geula et al . , 2015 ) . 12 Mouse ESCs expanded in Fetal Bovine Serum ( FBS ) / Lif conditions are also considered naïve and possess 13 features such as retention of pre - X inactivation state , ability to tolerate lack of repressors like Mettl3 and 14 Dnmt1 ( Geula et al . , 2015 . However , they do not retain a global hypomethylated epigenome and acquire 15 H3K27me3 over developmental genes ( Weinberger et al . , 2016a ) , and thus are considered relatively less 16 naïve than 2i / LIF grown mouse PSCs ( Marks et al . , 2012 ) . Rodent EpiSCs expanded in Fgf2 / Activin A 17 conditions show further consolidation and acquisition of their milieu of primed pluripotency 18 characteristics ( Brons et al . , 2007 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ) . EpiSC lines are heterogeneous in their epigenetic 19 and transcriptional patterns ( Kojima et al . , 2014 ) , and while they are pluripotent and give rise to 20 differentiated cells from all three germ layers , they are epigenetically restricted as evident for example in 21 their reduced ability , after long - term maintenance in FGF2 / ACTIVIN A conditions , to differentiate into 22 primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) ( Hayashi et al . , 2011 ) or contribute to chimera formation when injected in 23 the pre - implantation ICM ( Wu et al . , 2015a ) . 24 25 While conventional human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) and iPSCs ( hiPSCs ) growth 26 conditions entailed FGF / TGF as typical for murine EpiSC , these two cell types are not identical , and 27 hESC share several molecular features with naïve mESCs including expression of E - CADHERIN ( rather 28 than N - CADHERIN ) ( Weinberger et al . , 2016 ) . Further , conventional human ESCs express high levels of 29 PRDM14 and NANOG as murine naïve ESCs , and they are functionally dependent on their expression 30 4 ( Chia et al . , 2010 ) . Still however , hESCs retain a variety of epigenetic properties that are consistent with 1 possessing a primed pluripotent state . This includes inability to tolerate MEK / ERK signaling inhibition 2 ( Weinberger et al . , 2016 ) , predominant utilization of the proximal enhancer element to maintain OCT4 3 expression , tendency for initiation of X chromosome inactivation ( XCI ) in most female ESC lines 4 ( Mekhoubad et al . , 2012 ) , high levels of DNA methylation , prominent deposition of H3K27me3 and 5 bivalency acquisition on lineage commitment regulators ( Gafni et al . , 2013 ) . 6 7 The proof of concept for the metastability between naïve and primed state in rodents ( Hanna et 8 al . , 2009 ) , have raised the possibility that the human genetic background is more “stringent” in regards to 9 requirement for exogenous factors provided in allowing preservation of ground state - naïve pluripotency 10 in comparison to rodents . Indeed , several groups have previously established condition to derive naïve 11 MEK / ERK signaling independent genetically unmodified human PSCs . For example , NHSM conditions 12 do not require the use of exogenous transgenes or feeder cells , maintain teratoma formation competence 13 and entail the following components : 2iLIF , P38i / JNKi , PKCi , ROCKi , ACTIVIN and FGF2 . NHSM 14 conditions endow human PSCs with variety of naïve features including maintaining pluripotency while 15 MEK / ERK signaling is inhibited , predominant TFE3 nuclear localization , resolution of bivalent domains 16 over developmental regulators , in vitro reconstitution of human PGCLC and a mild reduction in DNA 17 methylation ( Gafni et al . , 2013 ; Irie et al . , 2015 ) . The latter effect is profoundly weaker than that seen in 18 mouse pluripotent cells , suggesting sub - optimal human naïve pluripotency growth conditions . 19 20 Exciting alternative conditions that generate MEK independent human naïve cells and retain a 21 more compelling milieu of transcriptional markers expressed in the human ICM were developed . Several 22 components found in NHSM conditions ( 2i , ROCK inhibitor , ACTIVIN , FGF2 ) were supplemented with 23 BRAF inhibitors , to generate MEF dependent naïve cell lines ( termed : 5iLA - , 5iLAF - , 6i / LA - and 4i / LA - 24 MEF ) ( Theunissen et al . , 2014 ) . Globally these conditions generated more pronounced downregulation in 25 DNA methylation and upregulation of naïve pluripotent cell markers . However , the hypomethylation in 26 these conditions was accompanied by immediate and global loss of imprinting over all imprinted loci 27 ( Theunissen , 2016 ) ( Bar et al . , 2017 ; Pastor et al . , 2016 ) and obligatory confounding chromosomal 28 abnormalities in nearly 100 % of the lines generated within 10 passages only ( Liu et al . , 2017 ) . Derivation 29 of human naïve ESC in t2iL - Go conditions has been reported with and without the use of exogenous 30 5 transgenes induction . In both cases , the generated cell lines do not form teratomas in vivo and can only 1 differentiate in vitro after an extended 3 - week transfer to primed - like conditions , thus questioning their 2 pluripotent functionality and stability ( Guo et al . , 2016 ; Liu et al . , 2017 ; Takashima et al . , 2014 ) . The 3 latter is in striking difference from rodent ground state naïve PSCs , which are fully pluripotent and can 4 initiate differentiation in vivo following autonomous induction of the needed priming ( capacitation ) 5 signals toward differentiation ( Ko et al . , 2009 ; Müller et al . , 2010 ; Takahashi et al . , 2003 ; Ying et al . , 6 2008 ) . 7 8 Therefore , these prior studies collectively suggest that none of the conditions devised so far are 9 optimal or enable closing the gap between mouse and human naive pluripotency characteristics . In this 10 study , we set out to devise enhanced defined conditions that enable the stabilization of hPSCs with 11 stringent functional and molecular properties , previously attributed to mouse ground state naïve ESCs and 12 to human preimplantation stages , while preserving cell - autonomous teratoma formation competence and 13 decipher defining features of their signaling and regulatory circuitry . We also aimed to establish 14 principles for capturing alternative human naïve PSCs without inhibiting MEK / ERK pathway that tends 15 to compromise DNA imprinting stability in both mouse and human naive PSCs ( Choi et al . , 2017 ; Di 16 Stefano et al . , 2018 ; Yagi et al . , 2017 ) . 17 18 Results 19 Defining human naïve pluripotency conditions that endow tolerance for depletion of RNA / DNA 20 methylation 21 22 A major challenge for capturing human naïve PSC conditions has been the lack of stringent 23 functional assays that allow screening for conditions endowing functionally naïve human PSCs ( De Los 24 Angeles et al . , 2015a ) . Recent studies have defined the functional ability of mouse naïve 2i / LIF 25 conditions to maintain their pluripotency upon knocking - out epigenetic repressors like Mettl3 and Dnmt1 26 ( m 6 A mRNA and DNA methyltransferase enzymes , respectively ) , while EpiSCs differentiate and undergo 27 apoptosis upon complete ablation of the same factors ( Geula et al . , 2015 , Liao et al . , 2015 ) . Further , 28 DNMT1 ablation leads to cell death and differentiation of human primed ESCs further underscoring this 29 primed aspect of their molecular identity ( Liao et al . , 2015 ) . As such , we hypothesized that the latter 30 6 functional attributes might be utilized to screen and define conditions endowing this stringent naïve 1 pluripotency feature ( i . e . maintenance of pluripotency in the absence of defined epigenetic repressors ) . 2 We engineered human WIBR3 hESC lines with conditional inducible ablation of the expression of 3 METTL3 ( Fig . 1a ) . This was obtained via introducing an exogenous METTL3 transgene under the 4 regulation of Tet - OFF promoter ( Liao et al . , 2015 ) , followed by CRISPR / Cas9 mediated ablation of both 5 endogenous human METTL3 alleles ( Fig . 1a ) . Two resultant clones were validated for METTL3 6 expression only from the exogenous allele , which can be shut off by addition of DOX to the media ( Tet - 7 OFF - METTL3 lines ) ( Fig . 1b ) . 8 9 Primed Tet - OFF - METTL3 hESCs expanded in primed TeSR or KSR / FGF2 conditions could 10 not be sustained in the presence of DOX more than four passages ( both on MEF or Geltrex coated dishes ) 11 and resulted in massive cell death and differentiation ( Fig . 1c ) , analogous to the result previously reported 12 for mouse EpiSCs ( Geula et al . , 2015 ) . The latter is also consistent with lack of reports showing 13 generation of complete KO METTL3 cells in human primed cells ( Bertero et al . , 2018 ) . In the presence 14 of MEFs , Tet - OFF - METTL3 could be poorly maintained in previously described human naive NHSM 15 conditions and with a very slow proliferation rate , but not in 4iLA - MEF , 5iLAF - MEF , 5iLA - MEF , 6iLA - 16 MEF , TESR / 3iL - MEF previously described naïve conditions ( Fig . 1c , S1a ) . However , in the absence of 17 MEFs , also NHSM conditions could not support maintenance of pluripotency when METTL3 was 18 completely ablated , suggesting that NHSM conditions can possibly be enhanced to endow the cells with 19 such ability ( Fig . S1a ) . We thus set out to test candidate molecules that may enrich NHSM condition and 20 allow to maintain Tet - OFF - METTL3 on Geltrex coated plates in the presence of DOX . 21 22 We tested whether supplementing NHSM conditions with individual small molecules that have 23 been previously implicated in boosting mouse or human naïve pluripotency formation or iPSC derivation 24 efficiency might achieve this goal ( Fig . 1d ) . Remarkably , supplementing NHSM conditions with the 25 Tankyrase inhibitor named IWR1 , but not any of the other 15 compounds tested , enabled expanding Tet - 26 OFF - METTL3 on DOX with great homogeneity ( Fig . 1e ) . IWR1 is a WNT inhibitor ( WNTi ) small 27 molecule that stabilizes AXIN protein in the cytoplasm by inhibiting Tankyrase enzyme ( abbreviated 28 herein as TNK inhibitor – TNKi ) ( Huang et al . , 2009 ) . It was included serendipitously among our 29 compounds of interest since when combined with GSK3 inhibitors on mouse and human primed cells , 30 7 this effect lead to enriching β Catenin only in the cytoplasm and such primed cells could be expanded 1 without exogenous FGF2 ( Kim et al . , 2013a ) . Using an independent specific TNKi , XAV939 , yielded a 2 similar effect , while using exo - IWR1 an inactive modified version of IWR1 failed to do so , supporting 3 specific inhibition of Tankyrase as the target yielding stability of these pluripotent cells ( Fig . 1f ) . Notably , 4 a number of recent publications have included TNKi among other ingredients for both naïve , extended 5 potential or primed hPSCs , however none of these different conditions that employ TNKi ( Bredenkamp et 6 al . , 2019a ; Smith et al . , 2012 ; Yang et al . , 2017a , 2017b ; Zimmerlin et al . , 2016a ) allow to maintain 7 OCT4 + in the absence of METTL3 or DNMT1 , likely due to the absence of other key ingredients 8 synergistically used in NHSM conditions but not in these previously described conditions ( i . e . 9 combination of ACTIVIN , PKCi , P38i / JNKi together with TNKi combination ) ( Fig . S1b ) . 10 11 We used previously described WIBR3 hESC line carrying knock - in Δ PE - OCT4 - GFP reporter 12 ( Theunissen et al . , 2014 ) ( Fig . S1c ) and found that supplementation of TNKi to NHSM conditions 13 yielded a dramatic increase in GFP signal when compared to primed , NHSM or 4i - LA conditions ( Fig . 14 1g , Fig . S1c ) . Consistent with studies conducted in mice ( Kim et al . , 2013a ) , including TNKi rendered 15 exogenous supplementation of FGF2 dispensable even in feeder free conditions ( Fig . 1g ) . Further , as 16 XAV939 inhibits WNT signaling , we validated that including GSK3 inhibitor is dispensable and , in fact , 17 compromises the intensity of Δ PE - OCT4 - GFP signal ( Fig . S1d ) . JNK / P38 inhibition boosted naïve 18 pluripotency marker expression and cell viability , therefore were maintained in the media used herein 19 ( Fig . S1e ) . Importantly , after optimizing NHSM conditions , we retried to substitute TNKi with other 20 components included in the screen , to exclude the possibility that the latter optimizations may facilitate a 21 different screening result . However , none of them allowed expanding METTL3 depleted cells in vitro as 22 seen with supplementing TNKi ( including VPA , BRAFi , Forskolin , Kenopaullone , SHHi , DOT1Li , 23 LSD1i , TGFRi , ERK5i ) ( Fig . S1f ) . 24 25 Defining human naïve pluripotency conditions independent of TGF / ACTIVIN signaling 26 27 Following the latter modifications human ESCs maintained uniformly high Δ PE - OCT4 - GFP 28 levels only in the presence of exogenous ACTIVIN A , and consistently differentiated when TGFR 29 inhibitor was provided ( Fig . 1h - i , Fig . S1g ) . We next tested whether a second targeted screening strategy 30 8 would allow us to identify a small molecule whose supplementation will render human PSCs that are 1 independent of exogenous ACTIVIN / TGF supplementation . It should be noted that none of the 2 previously described human naïve conditions have been able to maintain teratoma competent pluripotent 3 cells that can be maintained long term and validated for their naïve identity after prolonged specific 4 inhibition of ACTIVIN / NODAL signaling ( Liu et al . , 2017 ) . To do this , the latter TNKi supplemented 5 NHSM conditions were used in the absence of ACTIVIN A , and candidate molecules were added to 6 screen for allowing expanding OCT4 + PSCs independent of METTL3 expression ( on DOX ) and the 7 absence of exogenous ACTIVIN A ( Fig . 2a ) . While in most conditions OCT4 + cell fraction rapidly 8 deteriorated , we noted that a validated SRC inhibitor ( SRCi = CGP77675 ) dramatically maintained the 9 stability of dome like cells that were uniformly OCT4 + ( Fig . 2b ) . The latter led us to assemble a defined 10 FGF / TGF / ACTIVIN / MEF independent and serum free conditions which we term Human Enhanced 11 Naïve Stem cell Medium – HENSM ( Fig . 2c - d ) , which we systematically characterize and validate 12 herein . We also note that supplementation of SRCi in ACTIVIN A containing conditions , although was 13 not essential to maintain Δ PE - OCT4 - GFP + when ACTIVIN A was provided , supported consistency in 14 domed like morphology among naïve cells ( Fig . S1h ) ( we term this conditions HENSM - ACT and is 15 highlighted herein when used ) . 16 17 Both with and without METTL3 depletion in HENSM conditions , WIBR3 cells maintained their 18 typical domed like morphology and uniformly expressed pluripotency markers including KLF17 that is 19 specific to the human naïve state ( Fig . S2a - b ) . Measurement of m 6 A on mRNA showed over 90 % 20 depletion of total levels after DOX addition ( Fig . 2e ) , comparable to those seen upon knockout of the 21 Mettl3 / 14 in mouse naïve cells . ESCs maintained in the absence or presence of DOX for over 30 passages 22 remained pluripotent and , as it is typically standardized for murine ESCs and iPSCs , the human cells were 23 capable of generating mature teratomas in vivo without the need to passage them first for a period of time 24 in primed conditions or capacitation via unique conditions ( Rostovskaya et al . , 2019 ) prior to their 25 injection in immune - compromised mice ( Fig . 2f ) . The latter validate maintenance of naïve pluripotency 26 in human PSCs expanded in HENSM conditions , including when METTL3 protein and m 6 A levels on 27 mRNA were ablated . 28 29 9 To extend the previous findings to another repressor machinery , Δ PE - OCT4 - GFP - WIBR3 1 reporter human ESCs were targeted by CRISPR / Cas9 to generate DGCR8 null cells ( Fig . S2d - e ) . While 2 conducting such targeting on primed cells did not yield any null clones ( Fig . S2d ) , consistent with 3 inability to sustain mouse primed and human ESCs without DGCR8 due to its essentiality in this state 4 ( Geula et al . , 2015 ) , DGCR8 null cells could be obtained when the targeted cells were expanded in 5 HENSM conditions ( Fig . S2e - f ) . DGCR8 KO cells expanded in HENSM retained human naïve 6 pluripotency specific traits despite lacking microRNA expression equivalent to results obtained in mouse 7 naïve PSCs ( Fig . S2g ) . To test which of the naïve conditions enable expanding human naïve PSCs in the 8 absence of DNMT1 cells , a similar approach to that applied for making Tet - OFF - METTL3 herein , has 9 been recently used to generate TET - OFF DNMT1 in HUES64 ESC line ( Fig . 2g ) ( Liao et al . , 2015 ) . Cells 10 expanded in previously described naïve conditions including NHSM , 5i / LA . t2iL - GO ( or PXGL ) and 11 TESR / 3iL - MEF could not be maintained in the presence of DOX for more than 3 passages ( Fig . 2h - i , 12 S2h ) . HENSM and HENSM - ACT conditions allowed stable and unlimited expansion of DNMT1 13 depleted human naïve ESCs both in feeder and feeder free conditions ( Fig . 2i , S2h ) . Whole Genome 14 Bisulfite Sequencing ( WGBS ) confirmed global loss of DNA methylation in naïve DNMT1 depleted cells 15 expanded in HENSM conditions ( Fig . S2i ) that also maintained expression of all pluripotency markers 16 ( Fig . S2j ) . Removal either of ERKi , PKCi , SRCi or TNKi in HENSM conditions resulted in loss of 17 pluripotency when DNMT1 or METTL3 were depleted ( Fig . S2k ) . Collectively these results demonstrate 18 that HENSM conditions closely mimic stringent characteristics of mouse naïve ground state ESCs and , 19 for the first time , enable generation of human PSCs ablated for epigenetic repressors ( both in feeder and 20 feeder free conditions ) and that are independent from ACTIVIN / TGF signaling . 21 22 Tolerance for absence of exogenous L - Glutamine in HENSM conditions 23 24 Murine naïve ESCs retain bivalent metabolic capability utilizing both oxidative phosphorylation 25 ( OXPHOS ) and glycolytic metabolism , while upon priming they become dependent only on glycolytic 26 metabolism . As shown previously , naïve hPSCs in NHSM , 5i - LA and transgene induced t2iL - Go 27 conditions increase OXPHOS activity leading to retention of a bivalent metabolic profile ( Sperber et al . , 28 2015 ) . HENSM conditions were similarly tested herein . Measured basal oxygen consumption rate ( OCR ) 29 was substantially higher in HENSM conditions than in primed PSC ( Fig . S2l ) . Higher electron transport 30 10 chain activity in HENSM was evidenced by a greater OCR increase in response to the mitochondrial 1 uncoupler FCCP ( Fig . S2l ) . Both NHSM , HENSM and transgene dependent t2iL - Go reset conditions , but 2 not primed or 5iLA conditions , PSCs maintained pluripotency when glucose uptake was blocked with 3 1mM 2 - Deoxy - D - Glucose ( DG ) , similar to what was observed with mouse naïve PSCs in 2i / LIF ( Fig . 4 S2m ) . 5 More stringently , a newly identified metabolic feature in naive ESCs in 2i or 2i / LIF is that they 6 can endogenously synthesize glutamine at sufficient levels to maintain adequate alpha - ketogluterate 7 ( α KG ) levels ( Carey et al . , 2015a ) . While they benefit from exogenous L - Glutamine supplementation , it 8 is not essential for their stability or pluripotency as they can metabolically synthesize it endogenously as 9 part of their altered metabolic configuration ( Carey et al . , 2015a ) . FBS / LIF naïve murine ESCs or primed 10 EpiSCs cannot be maintained in the absence of exogenous L - Glutamine for an extended period of time 11 ( Carey et al . , 2015a ) . To compare the latter observation and apply them on distinct human pluripotent 12 states , WIBR3 - OCT4 - GFP knock - in ESC line , Δ PE - WIBR3 - OCT4 - GFP knock - in ESC line and H9 - 13 NANOG - GFP ESC lines were then tested for ability to maintain pluripotency in the presence and absence 14 of exogenously added L - Glutamine ( Fig . 2j ) . Importantly , we failed to maintain primed PSCs or other 15 previously described naïve PSCs in the absence of L - Glutamine ( in NHSM , 4i / LA - MEF , 5i / LAF - MEF , 16 6iLA - MEF , TESR / 3iL - MEF , t2iLGo even in feeder cells presence for more than 10 days ( Fig . 2j ) . 17 However , Δ PE - WIBR3 - OCT4 - GFP expanded in HENSM was not compromised when L - glutamine was 18 not included in HENSM conditions ( Fig . S3a ) and GFP signal was positive for H9 - NANOG - GFP ESC 19 both in the presence and absence of L - Glutamine ( both on feeder and feeder free conditions ) ( Fig . S3a ) . 20 Cells expressed general and naïve specific pluripotency markers in HENSM with and without exogenous 21 L - Glutamine and generated differentiated teratomas without the need for in vitro passaging in primed 22 conditions before subcutaneous in vivo injection ( Fig . S3b - c ) . Other previously published combination 23 that entailed TNKi among other ingredients for both naïve and primed PSCs ( Bredenkamp et al . , 2019 ; 24 Wu et al . , 2015 ; Yang et al . , 2017 , Zimmerlin et al . , 2016 ) , failed to preserve pluripotency in the absence 25 of exogenous L - Glutamine as seen in HENSM based conditions described herein ( Fig . 2j ) . The latter is 26 due to the absence of other key ingredients synergistically used in NHSM conditions contributing to naive 27 pluripotency that are used herein but not in these previously described conditions ( i . e . the unique 28 combination of SRCi , PKCi together with TNKi combination in HENSM ) ( Fig . 2j ) . Collectively , these 29 11 results validate that HENSM conditions can maintain naïve pluripotency characteristics and endow the 1 cells with ability to be expanded in the absence of exogenous L - Glutamine as previously described for 2 murine 2i / LIF naïve PSCs ( Carey et al . , 2015a ) . 3 4 Transcriptional characterization of human PSCs in HENSM conditions 5 6 We next aimed to revert previously established primed PSCs lines and to derive new lines 7 directly in HENSM - ACT and HENSM conditions from the ICM of human blastocysts . Human 8 blastocysts were plated on mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) coated plates and medium successfully 9 generated domed cell outgrowths following 6 - 8 days of plating . ICM derived outgrowths were then 10 trypsinized and passaged . Subsequently , we were able to establish and characterize 5 newly derived stem 11 cell lines termed LIS36 , LIS42 and LIS46 in HENSM - ACT and LIS41 and LIS49 ESCs in HENSM 12 conditions ( Fig . S4a ) . Multiple conventional ( hereafter will be named “primed” ) hESC lines ( WIBR1 , 13 WIBR2 , WIBR3 , HUES64 , H1 , H9 ) were plated on Geltrex coated dishes in HENSM medium ( Fig . 14 S4b ) . Within 4 - 8 days of applying this protocol , dome - shaped colonies with packed round cell 15 morphology , typical of mESCs , could be readily isolated and further expanded ( Fig . S4b ) . Adult human 16 dermal fibroblast cells or peripheral blood cells were reprogrammed to iPSCs in HENSM conditions 17 following either lentiviral transduction with DOX inducible OKSM factors ( BF1 hiPSC ) or by non - 18 integrating sendai viruses ( JH1and MECP5 hiPSC ) ( Fig . S4c ) . All polyclonal and subcloned hESC and 19 iPSC lines expanded in HENSM conditions were uniformly positive for pluripotent markers alkaline 20 phosphatase ( AP ) , OCT4 , NANOG , SSEA4 , TRA1 - 60 and TRA1 - 81 ( representative images in Fig . S5 ) 21 and robustly formed mature teratomas in vivo without the need for short - or long - term exposure to primed 22 growth conditions prior to their injection into host mice , and as typically observed with rodent ground 23 state naïve PSCs ( Fig . S6a ) . Naïve lines were passaged with TryplE every 3 - 5 days and had single cell 24 cloning efficiency up to 40 % , while primed cell single cell cloning increased only up to 10 % even when 25 ROCK inhibition was used . Human naïve pluripotent lines maintained normal karyotype after extended 26 passaging in HENSM - ACT or HENSM in most lines of tested ( Fig . S7a ) . In some cultures ( < 10 % ) and 27 after over 30 passages , minor aneuploidy cells were observed however we did not observe a recurrent 28 abnormality between any of these lines as determined by G - banding of metaphase chromosomes ( Fig . 29 S7a ) . The latter results were corroborated by performing e - karyotyping that is based on RNA - seq 30 12 expression of HENSM derived lines ( Fig . S6b ) , thus indicating that epigenetic resetting in HENSM does 1 not cause obligatory chromosomal abnormalities nor select for pre - existing abnormal variants , as has been 2 seeing for other naïve conditions like 5iLA - MEF or t2iL - Go conditions that induce 96 - 100 % 3 chromosomal abnormality already by passage 10 ( Liu et al . , 2017 ) . 4 5 We compared global gene expression patterns between naïve and primed hESCs and hiPSCs , 6 many of which were genetically matched . Unbiased clustering of genome - wide expression profiles 7 demonstrated that naïve hESC and hiPSCs possess a distinct gene expression pattern and clustered 8 separately from conventional / primed hESCs and hiPSCs ( Fig . 3a - b ) . Transcripts associated with naïve 9 pluripotency were significantly upregulated in naïve cells ( Blakeley et al . , 2015a ) . The later included 10 NANOG , TFCP2L1 , KLF17 , KLF4 , STELLA ( DPPA3 ) , DPPA5 , DNMT3L , KHDC1L and ARGFX 11 shown in two independent datasets ( Fig . S8a and Table S1 - S2 ) . RT - PCR analysis validated the dramatic 12 upregulation in naïve PSCs expanded both in HENSM and HENSM - ACT conditions ( Fig . 3c ) . When 13 including previously and independently published naïve datasets generated in 5iLA - MEF , 4i - LAF and 14 t2i - LIF - GO - NK2 , we note that cells generated in HENSM and HENSM - ACT conditions clustered with 15 all the latter naïve conditions and not with primed samples ( Fig . 3a - b , Fig . S8b - f ) . The same 16 transcriptional qualities were detected in human PSCs expanded in HENSM Xeno - Free ( HENSM - XF 17 conditions ) on BioLaminin511 ( Fig . 3a ) . FACS analysis confirmed upregulation of previously identified 18 human naïve pluripotency markers Gb3 / CD77 and IL6ST / CD130 in HENSM conditions , and primed 19 pluripotency marker CD24 was downregulated in HENSM conditions ( Fig . S8g ) ( Collier et al . , 2017 ) . 20 SUSD2 surface marker was also expressed on all naïve cells lines tested , however was meaningfully 21 expressed on nearly 50 % human primed cell lines tested ( Fig . S9e ) , which provides a cautionary note 22 regarding recent claims ( Bredenkamp et al . , 2019 ) that it is an exclusive and decisive marker to exclude 23 the human primed state in vitro . Importantly , naïve pluripotent cells had profoundly down regulated 24 transcripts associated with lineage commitment genes including T , ZIC2 and VIM1 that are expressed in 25 primed hESCs ( Fig . S8a , S9a - b ) . By comparing the transcriptome to that described during early human 26 pre - implantation development , cells expanded in HENSM conditions , but not primed cells , showed 27 specific enrichment to profile of late morula - early blastocysts specific signature ( Fig . 3d ) . We 28 additionally introduced STELLA - CFP knock - in allele via CRISPR / Cas9 ( Fig . S9c - d ) , to monitor 29 pluripotency maintenance in the different tested conditions , and STELLA - CFP was upregulated in both 30 13 HENSM and 5iLA conditions ( Fig . S9d ) . Similar to its upregulation and importance in maintaining 1 human naïve pluripotency in 5i / LA conditions ( Pastor et al . , 2018 ) , TFAP2C KO lines ( Fig . S10a - d ) 2 showed that it is essential for deriving and maintaining human naïve PSCs in both HENSM and HENSM - 3 ACT conditions ( Fig . S10e ) . ESRRB is not detectable in human genetically unmodified cells expanded in 4 HENSM conditions ( Fig . S10f - j ) , consistent with its negative expression in the human ICM ( Blakeley et 5 al . , 2015b ; Petropoulos et al . , 2016 ) . The latter results confirm that HENSM conditions attain consensus 6 transcriptional features observed in other previously published naïve hPSCs studies or in vivo measured 7 human embryo transcriptional data , while uniquely retaining the critical ability to generate teratomas after 8 being directly injected as naïve cells in immune - compromised mice . 9 10 We profiled and compared Transposable Element ( TE ) - derived transcripts in conventional and 11 naïve human PSCS expanded in HENSM conditions ( Theunissen et al . , 2016 ) . The top 5 , 000 TEs with 12 largest SD separated naïve and primed samples both in hierarchical clustering ( Fig . S11a , Table S3 ) and 13 in PCA based analysis ( Fig . S11b ) . Members of the SINE - VTR - Alu ( SVA ) family of TEs and HERVK - 14 associated LTR were transcribed almost exclusively in HENSM conditions similar to previously obtained 15 in 5i / LA and transgene dependent t2iLGo conditions ( Fig . S12 ) ( Theunissen et al . , 2016 ) . We used TE 16 profiling to measure the degree to which HENSM and primed conditions resemble pluripotent cells in 17 early human embryos in vivo . HENSM naïve , but not primed cells , demonstrated the most significant 18 overlap with the human morula and epiblast stages when looking at TEs ( Fig . S11c ) , as was similarly 19 shown for coding genes ( Fig . 3d ) . 20 21 Epigenetic characterization of human PSCs in HENSM conditions 22 23 To further delve into the patterns which distinguish the naïve condition from its primed 24 counterpart in hESC and converge with its in vivo equivalents , we explored change in chromatin 25 accessibility of each condition by ATAC - seq . By comparing unique chromatin accessibility loci found in 26 different pre - implantation stages ( i . e . 2 - cell , 8 - cell and ICM ) we compared how much of these loci show 27 an increase or decrease in chromatin accessibility of naïve compared to primed hESCs . Like in datasets 28 generated in 5iLA - MEF and t2iL - Go - MEF , HENSM hESCs chromatin accessibility corresponds more to 29 the ICM than earlier stages ( Fig . 3e ) . These results support the endowment of late pre - implantation like 30 14 transposon expression and chromatin accessibility profile in PSCs expanded in HENSM conditions in 1 vitro . 2 3 We next moved to test whether HENSM conditions endow human naive PSCs with a pre - X 4 chromosome configuration . We used previously generated primed human WIBR2 hESCs carrying 5 knock - in MECP2 - tdTomato and MECP2 - GFP alleles ( Fig . 4a ) ( Theunissen et al . , 2016 ) . Correctly 6 targeted clone # 29 - 9 expresses only the red allele , however upon transferring the cells into HENSM 7 conditions > 99 % of cells expressed both fluorescent markers consistent with reactivation of both x 8 chromosome alleles . Transferring the cells into primed media allowed inactivation of X chromosome as 9 evident by obtaining GFP - / tdTomato + pattern > 95 % of the reprimed cells ( Fig . 4a ) . We carried out FISH 10 analysis for ATRX in female cells as this locus is expressed from one copy even in human primed 11 WIBR3 hESCs that have undergone erosion of X chromosome ( Xe ) . Indeed , two ATRX foci could be 12 uniformly found in naïve , but not primed , human female PSCs supporting reactivation of X chromosome 13 ( Fig . 4b ) . SNP based analysis of X chromosome allele expression as detected in RNA - seq datasets 14 showed biallelic expression of X chromosome encoded genes in HENSM but not primed conditions ( Fig . 15 4c ) , consistent with functional reactivation of X chromosome in female naïve PSCS induced in HENSM 16 ( Bar et al . , 2019 ) . 17 18 We sampled human naïve PSCs in HENSM and HENSM - ACT for DNA methylation status by 19 Whole genome Bisulfite Sequencing ( WGBS ) . Lines tested displayed profound downregulation of global 20 methylation levels ( Fig . 4d - e ) from 80 % in primed hPSCs to 50 % in HENSM - ACT and to 65 % in 21 HENSM expanded human hPSCs . It has been previously shown in mouse ground state naive conditions 22 that rapid loss of global DNA methylation level result from partial decrease in UHRF1 protein expression 23 levels while maintaining DNMT1 levels ( von Meyenn et al . , 2016 ) . Indeed , in human cells expanded in 24 HENSM , DNMT1 methyltransferase protein expression is maintained , while UHRF1 protein is partially 25 ( 50 - 60 % ) depleted ( Fig . 4f ) which may underlie the global downregulation in DNA methylation in 26 HENSM conditions . It is important to note that supplementing HENSM with BRAF inhibitor used in 27 5i / LAF conditions leads to dramatic downregulation also in DNMT1 ( Fig . 2h ) . This pattern is also 28 observed in 5i / LAF condition which might explain the immediate and global loss of imprinting ( loss of 29 imprinting of > 95 % of imprinted loci within 5 passages ) . As DNMT1 levels are maintained in HENSM 30 15 conditions and UHRF1 protein downregulation was partial , we did not observe immediate global loss of 1 all imprinted genes in HENSM or HENSM - ACT conditions ( Fig . S13 ) as has been previously seen in 2 5iLA or 2iL - Go based conditions ( Pastor et al . , 2016b ; Theunissen , 2016b ) . However , loss of imprinting 3 in HENSM occurred sporadically only at some individual loci , at lower frequencies and only after 4 prolonged cell passaging ( > 15 - 20 passages , Fig . S13 ) , which constitutes an improvement over previously 5 reported hypomethylated human naïve PSCs and comparable frequency to those observed in human 6 primed cells ( Bar et al . , 2017 ) . Collectively , the above findings indicate that HENSM and HENSM - ACT 7 conditions consolidate human naïve pluripotency identity and endow them with nearly all known naïve 8 pluripotency and differentiation features that have been attributed to human ICM in vivo , previously 9 derived human naïve cells and murine naïve ground state cells . 10 11 Differentiation competence of naive hiPSC following interspecies chimaerism in mice 12 13 Given that the naïve hPSCs described above maintained genetic integrity and were capable of 14 forming teratoma without the need for exogenous priming or capacitation prior to injection , we next 15 moved to evaluate whether human naïve iPSCs can integrate and differentiate following microinjection 16 into host mouse blastocyst ( Gafni et al . , 2013b ; Wu and Izpisúa Belmonte , 2016 ) . Microinjection of 17 human GFP labeled naïve iPSCs ( maintained for at least 3 passages in HENSM based conditions ) into 18 mouse E2 . 5 morulas showed robust integration in mouse in vitro developed ICMs at E3 . 5 . Blastocysts 19 obtained after micro - injection with human naïve iPSCs were implanted in pseudo - pregnant female mice 20 and their survival and integration was assayed throughout next 14 days using various imaging techniques . 21 HENSM - derived hiPSCs are able to colonize mouse embryos up to E17 . 5 at various anatomic regions of 22 different embryonic germ layers ( Fig . S14 - S15 ) . Specific marker staining for human nuclei excluded any 23 contamination by mouse PSC lines ( Fig . S14 ) . 24 25 Our results indicate that the contribution levels of human GFP + cells in mouse embryos , although 26 meaningful and reproducible , are relatively low ( ~ 3 % of mice are chimeric with naïve hiPSC derived 27 cells ) . Thus , we sought to develop technical platforms that can enhance such integration and also allow us 28 to better visualize integrating human cells in the developing mouse embryo . Recently , mouse ESC 29 depleted for p53 outcompete host pluripotent cells after blastocyst microinjection by cell competition 30 phenomenon that has been recently documented in mice ( Dejosez et al . , 2013 ) , and can generate very 31 16 high contribution chimeras by blocking their tendency for apoptosis . Based on the latter , we tested 1 whether manipulating these pathways might similarly endow injected naïve hiPSCs with competitive 2 advantage and increase human cell chimerism in developing mouse embryos . GFP hiPSC lines were 3 targeted with CRISPR / Cas9 to generate P53 - / - cell lines ( Fig . S16 , S17 ) . Remarkably , after microinjection 4 into mouse morulas or aggregation with 2 - cell embryos ( Fig . S18 ) , a 4 - fold increase in the number of 5 chimeric animals was obtained ( Fig . 4g , Fig . S18 - S25 ) and a dramatic increase in the extent of chimerism 6 per embryo ( up to 20 % cells per embryo Fig . S25c ) . Furthermore , differentiation was validated in 7 chimaeric embryos for major developmental markers covering all three embryonic germ layers 8 overlapping extensively with human - derived GFP signal ( Fig . 4h , Fig . S18 - S25 ) . Taken together , these 9 results substantiate generation of advanced human - mouse interspecies chimaera with various engraftment 10 in many defined lineages up to E17 . 5 from HENSM based conditions . 11 WNT / ß - CATENIN and SRC / NFkB signaling are major priming pathways compromising human 12 naïve pluripotency 13 14 The results above indicate that functional naïve pluripotency in HENSM composition not only 15 relies on inhibition of ERK and PKC pathways , but also on inhibition of TNK and SRC . Depletion of any 16 of the inhibitors for these 4 pathways compromised naïve pluripotency as exemplified by X chromosome 17 inactivation in reporter female hESCs ( Fig . 5a ) . Combined depletion of TNKi and SRCi pushed human 18 PSCs toward complete loss of pluripotency within a number of passages ( Fig . 5b , S26a ) , underlining the 19 conclusions that ERKi together with simultaneous tripartite inhibition of PKCi - SRCi - TNKi are essential 20 for functional defined conditions for human naïve pluripotency . We next aimed to define the signaling 21 pathway downstream of Tankyrase inhibition that facilitate human naïve PSCs stabilization . WNT 22 signaling is a well - established promoter of rodent naive pluripotency where it leads to ß - CATENIN 23 ( ßCAT ) nuclear localization which in turn neutralizes the repression by TCF3 effector and derepresses 24 naïve pluripotency targets ( ten Berge et al . , 2011 ; Wray et al . , 2011 ) . Although some studies have 25 indicated that titrating WNT stimulation level is needed when working with human naïve cells via using 26 lower doses of GSK3 inhibitor or by adding Tankyrase inhibitor together with GSK3i ( leading to high 27 cytoplasmic ß - CAT ) ( Theunissen et al . , 2014 ; Zimmerlin et al . , 2016 ) , they concluded that WNT 28 stimulation is helpful for promoting human naïve pluripotency exactly as seen in mouse PSCs . Other 29 studies , indicated that WNT inhibition is beneficial for initial reversion of primed to naïve pluripotency , 30 17 however its continued application compromised human naive pluripotency and that 2i with titrated WNT 1 stimulation is the optimal pattern for maintaining human naive PSCs ( Bredenkamp et al . , 2019a , 2 Bredenkamp et al . , 2019b ) , and that WNT inhibition , rather than stimulation , was needed for priming and 3 capacitation of human naïve pluripotency ( Bredenkamp et al . , 2019a ) . 4 5 Given that prior studies did not rely on exacting reporter and knockout models for WNT signaling 6 components and did not use teratoma competent cell lines , we turned to generate ßCAT KO cells on naïve 7 pluripotency reporter cell lines to give a definitive answer for this fundamental question ( Fig . S27 ) . 8 ßCAT - KO hESCs maintained high levels of Δ PE - OCT4 - GFP in HENSM condition , and upon removal of 9 XAV939 , GFP level was not decreased in BCAT - KO , but only in WT ESCs ( Fig . 5c ) . Supplementing 10 naïve cells with WNT stimulator , like CHIR99021 , or depleting BCAT inhibitor ( TNKi ) , activated WNT 11 signaling in human PSCs ( Fig . 5d ) compromised Δ PE - OCT4 - GFP levels ( Fig . 5c ) , compromised their 12 domed shape like morphology ( Fig . 5e ) and their naïve - like transcriptional profile ( Fig . 3a ) . We 13 introduced tamoxifen induced ßCAT - ERT transgene into ßCAT - KO hESCs , and we noted that in human 14 Δ PE - OCT4 - GFP signal , naïve transcription profile and domed morphology were compromised upon 15 4OHT stimulation ( Fig . 5f , Fig S26b - d ) . This is in striking contrast to mouse Δ PE - Oct4 - GFP ESCs 16 expanded in N2B27 LIF conditions that upon tamoxifen treatment induced Δ PE - Oct4 - GFP reporter and 17 naive characteristic domed like morphology ( Fig . 5f ) . Similarly , while KO of Tcf3 boosts mouse naïve 18 pluripotency and alleviates the need for WNT stimulation ( Wray et al . , 2011b ) , TCF3 KO human ESCs 19 ( Fig . S28a - b ) still required WNTi to maintain their naïve identity in HENSM conditions highlighting a 20 major difference between mouse and human naïve pluripotency ( Fig . S28c - d ) . Finally , supplementing 21 HENSM conditions with CHIR compromised their ability to maintain pluripotency upon depletion of 22 DNA and RNA methylation or omitting L - Glutamine from the culture conditions ( Fig . S28e ) . Cross - 23 species comparison of in vivo mouse and human RNA - seq data of pre - implantation blastocysts shows a 24 strong signature for AXIN1 / 2 upregulation in human but not mouse ICM ( Fig . S28f ) . Collectively , these 25 findings clearly establish WNT - ßCAT signaling as a major priming agent for human , but not mouse , 26 naïve pluripotency and establish that ablation of ßCATENIN can substitute for the need for Tankyrase or 27 WNT pathway inhibition . 28 29 18 SRC inhibition has been shown previously to deplete activation of downstream effectors 1 including ERK , PKC and NFkB signaling ( Lee et al . , 2007 ; Lluis et al . , 2007 ) . Given that SRCi was 2 needed in HENSM conditions despite continued direct blocking of ERK and PKC pathways , this has led 3 us to focus on NFkB as a potential effector mediating the beneficial effect of the use of SRCi ( Torres and 4 Watt , 2008 ) . Luciferase reporter assay activity showed pronounced activity for NFkB signaling in primed 5 conditions in comparison to HENSM naïve expanded cells ( Fig . 5g ) , and activity of NFkB became 6 prominently induced upon omission of SRC in HENSM conditions ( Fig . 5g , Fig . S29a ) . The transfection 7 of dominant negative IkB (cid:0) subunit , which blocks NfKB signalling , in ßCAT - KO ; Δ PE - OCT4 - GFP 8 hESCs allowed maintenance of Δ PE - OCT4 - GFP not only in HENSM without TNKi , but also without 9 SRCi ( Fig . 5h ) . These results establish that WNT - BCAT and SRC - NFkB pathways compromise human 10 naïve pluripotency . Further , the results on Δ PE - OCT4 - GFP , RT - PCR and DNA hypomethylation 11 establish that ACTIVIN A , rather than BMP4 , supports human naïve pluripotency ( Fig . 1h , 3c and 4d - 12 e ) . The latter can be consistent with the observations that single cell - RNA - seq data on mouse and human 13 ICMs show that human ICM retains high NODAL expression but not that of BMP4 which is highly 14 expressed only in the mouse ICM ( Blakeley et al . , 2015a ; Weinberger et al . , 2015 ) . 15 16 In mouse ground state naïve conditions , LIF / Stat3 has been shown to be a booster for naïve 17 marker expression however they can be omitted without entire collapse of the naïve PSC circuit ( Ying et 18 al . , 2008b ) . By omitting LIF from HENSM conditions and by generating STAT3 KO human naïve PSCs , 19 we show that LIF can slightly boost the purity of undifferentiated cells in culture ( Fig . 5a ) and naïve 20 marker expression by RT - PCR ( Fig . S29a ) however it is dispensable and human naive PSCs can maintain 21 their naïve identity even in the absence of LIF / STAT3 signaling ( Fig . S29b - d ) as has been previously 22 shown for rodent ground state naïve PSCs in 3i conditions ( 3 inhibitors of ERK , GSK3 and FGFR ) ( Ying 23 et al . , 2008b ) . 24 25 KLF17 is functionally essential for human , but not mouse , naïve pluripotency 26 27 Analysis of chromatin accessibility revealed differences in accessibility of DNA binding proteins 28 and protein families , unique for each pluripotent configuration . Binding motifs of different TFs like 29 KLF17 and KLF4 were found to be significantly enriched ( corrected p - value ~ 0 ) in naïve chromatin 30 19 accessible loci whereas GATA family are more prone to be found in the primed condition ( Fig . 6a , Table 1 S4 ) . We initially focused on KLF17 gene , which is specifically expressed in human naïve conditions and 2 has been shown to promote ERV expression pattern in humans ( Pontis et al . , 2019 ) however the 3 essentiality of its functional importance for maintaining human naïve circuitry remains to be established . 4 We generated single and double KO ESC lines for KLF4 and KLF17 TFs ( Fig . S30 ) . Remarkably KO of 5 KLF17 led to collapse of naïve pluripotency in HENSM conditions , while cells maintain their 6 pluripotency in HENSM - ACT as measured by OCT4 - GFP reporter ( Fig . 6b ) . The latter also support the 7 notion how ACTIVIN A supplementation promotes naïve pluripotency in humans . However , double KO 8 naïve ESCs for KLF4 / KLF17 deteriorated toward differentiation and most cells lost OCT4 - GFP 9 expression in both HENSM and HENSM - ACT conditions ( Fig . 6b ) . In mice , Klf17 is not expressed in 10 the mouse ICM or ESCs , but rather only until the 4 Cell stage in vivo ( Fig . S31a ) . Newly generated Klf17 11 KO mice were viable and pups were obtained at the expected mendelian ratios and were fertile ( Fig . 12 S31b - f ) . Unlike the strong phenotype seen in human KLF17 KO ESCs in HENSM conditions , mouse 13 Klf17 KO ESCs were indistinguishable from WT cells and did not show any compromise in their naïve 14 pluripotency marker expression ( Fig 6c , Fig . S31g ) . These results establish a great dependency of human , 15 but not mouse , naïve pluripotency on KLF17 that greatly stabilizes the TF circuitry . 16 17 To better understand the role of naïve specific pluripotency factors like KLF4 and KLF17 versus 18 regulators of both naïve and primed cells like OCT4 and SOX2 , we examined the DNA binding profile of 19 the master pluripotent TF regulators OCT4 and SOX2 and naïve promoting TFs like KLF17 , KLF4 and 20 TFAP2C using ChIP - seq . KLF17 binds 12197 genes , mostly in their promoter ( 59 % in < = 1kb from TSS , 21 Fig . 6d ) , unlike OCT4 / SOX2 that bind typically to enhancers ( 72 % and 85 % in Distal intergenic regions 22 and introns , respectively ) . KLF17 binds more substantially to naïve - specific open regions ( Fig . 6e ) . 23 Interestingly , OCT4 and SOX2 , known to work as a complex ( Merino et al . , 2014 ) , show high correlation 24 between their binding targets , yet share significantly less reciprocal binding sites with other naïve specific 25 KLF17 and KLF4 ( Fig . 6f ) . The latter explain why despite the presence of OCT4 and SOX2 in human 26 naïve PSCs , they could not compensate for depletion of KLF4 or KLF17 as the latter constitute major 27 regulators of pluripotency specific genes and that are not bound by OCT4 or SOX2 ( e . g . KLF4 , DPPA3 , 28 NODAL , HORMAD1 , Fig . 6g , Table S5 ) . The latter also provides wider basis for the importance of 29 KLF17 in human naïve pluripotency . 30 20 1 2 Inhibition of NOTCH / RBPj pathway facilitates maintenance of human naïve pluripotency without 3 ERK inhibition 4 5 As has been previously shown in mice ( Choi et al . , 2017 ; Yagi et al . , 2017 ) , the use of MEK / ERK 6 inhibition is the major mediator for inducing global DNA hypomethylation which in turns leads to 7 sporadic erosion of imprinting that gets more severe with extended passaging . In mice , using alternative 8 naïve conditions that do not employ ERK inhibitor or titrating ERKi , allows isolating murine PSCs with 9 all features of naivety except from global hypomethylation ( Choi et al . , 2017 ; Yagi et al . , 2017 ) . The 10 latter murine cells are naïve by nearly all features and are capable of generate all - iPS mice with 11 contribution to the germline , and thus provide a safer route for exploiting mouse naïve PSCs . 12 13 Although erosion of imprinting was slow and sporadic on few loci in HENSM conditions and 14 only after extended passaging ( Fig . S13 ) , this may complicate the use of naïve cells in future clinical 15 applications . We thus aimed to define alternative HENSM ( a HENSM ) conditions that allow naïve hPSC 16 isolation and maintenance but without global DNA hypomethylation . Notably , recent studies showing 17 titration of ERKi in 5i / LA conditions slightly improved the chromosomal aberrancies frequency per line 18 in hESCs , still all lines had at least one genetic abnormality , and titrating ERKi levels in these conditions 19 did not abrogate global hypomethylation and global loss of imprinting at all loci ( Di Stefano et al . , 2018 ) . 20 The latter was likely because these conditions still had BRAF inhibitor which is upstream to MEK / ERK 21 pathway and contributes to the rapid and radical DNA hypomethylation induced in these cells ( Pastor et 22 al . , 2016 ) . 23 24 Withdrawal or partial ( 33 % ) titration of ERKi from HENSM compromised the naivety of human 25 ESC as evident by a decrease in Δ PE - OCT4 - GFP levels and loss of X - reactivation state in most of the 26 cells within the expanded population ( Fig . 7a - b ) . Supplementing ACTIVIN A upon omission of ERKi 27 from HENSM conditions did not block loss of X reactivation in female cell lines ( Fig . 7d – lower 28 panels ) . Thus , we set out to screen for added compounds that would enable maintenance of pre - x 29 inactivation upon omitting or titrating MEKi / ERKi ( Fig . 7c ) . Remarkably , we noted that adding of 30 21 gamma secretase inhibitor DBZ , which blocks NOTCH pathway ( Ichida et al . , 2014 ) , allowed robust and 1 feeder free maintenance of human naïve cells when ERKi was omitted ( 0 HENSM conditions ) or titrated 2 down from 1 μ M to 0 . 33 μ M termed ( t HENSM conditions ) ( Fig . 7d - e ) 3 4 Human PSCs expanded in aHENSM conditions ( 0HENSM and tHENSM ) maintain Δ PE - OCT4 - 5 GFP signal equivalent to HENSM conditions ( Fig . 7f ) , and maintained pre - X inactivation state in female 6 cell lines ( Fig . 7d ) . RT - PCR analysis showed that the lines expressed naïve pluripotency markers ( Fig . 7 7h ) , although levels were less induced in comparison to when ERKi was used . Global gene expression 8 analysis showed that the cells clustered with HENSM naïve PSCs rather than primed PSCs ( Fig . 7i , Fig 9 S32a ) . At the functional levels , the cells showed no enhanced tendency for obtaining chromosomal 10 abnormalities and were competent in differentiating into PGCLCs in vitro ( Fig . S32e ) and making 11 teratomas without any need for priming in vitro before injections ( Fig . S6a ) . Cells could be maintained 12 upon depletion of DNMT1 , METTL3 or exogenous L - glutamine and these qualities depended on the 13 presence of DBZ ( Fig . S32b - d ) . WGBS analysis showed that these alternative 0HENSM and tHENSM 14 conditions did not upregulate DNMT3L enzyme and did not show trends of global hypomethylation that 15 were seen in HENSM or HENSM - ACT even after extended passaging ( Fig . 4d - e , Fig . S33a ) and 16 consistently did not show accelerated loss of imprinting compared to parental primed cells Fig . S33b - c ) . 17 Generation of RBPj KO hESCs ( Fig . S34 ) allowed expanding human naïve PSCs in tHENSM and 18 0HENSM without adding DBZ , proving that NOTCH / RBPj ( Castel et al . , 2013 ) is the main mediator of 19 dismantling naïve pluripotency in human cells when ERKi is depleted ( Fig . 7j - k ) . These results show 20 that , equivalent to what was obtained in rodent in vitro PSCs with t2iL and a2iL mouse conditions that 21 endow naïve features in murine PSCs without compromising global DNA methylation and imprinting 22 regulation ( Choi et al . , 2017 ; Yagi et al . , 2017 ) , this can now be obtained also with human naïve - like 23 PSCs . 24 25 Discussion 26 27 The findings reported herein consolidate the previously raised notion that different genetic 28 backgrounds assume distinct states of pluripotency in vitro , the stability of which is regulated by 29 endogenous genetic determinants that remain unknown , and can be modified by defined exogenous 30 22 factors that support the naïve ground state of pluripotency ( Reik and Surani , 2015 ) . The stringency in 1 requirement for these exogenous factors appears to be different among distinct species , as exemplified 2 by the requirement for simultaneous inhibition of SRC , PKC , NOTCH and multiple MAPK kinase 3 pathways in human naïve cells . However , certain pathway like WNT and ACTIVIN signaling are 4 divergent between mice and humans , as only in humans WNT inhibition and ACTIVIN stimulation 5 promote naïve pluripotency and contribute to the unique molecular and epigenetic configuration of 6 naïve pluripotency described herein . The molecular basis for the latter findings remains to be 7 mechanistically defined . Our results also suggest that epigenetic priming of human pluripotent cells is 8 predominantly caused by supplementation of WNT and FGF . 9 10 The above results on the requirement for integrated WNT - SRC - PKCi to maintain human naive 11 pluripotency can explain why previous described conditions that applied only some of these three 12 essential components had compromised and unstable naïve pluripotency features . For example , Zambidis 13 and colleagues indicated Tankyrase to promote human PSCs in ERKi containing conditions , however did 14 not include PKCi , SRCi and still used WNT stimulation ( Zimmerlin et al . , 2016 ) , which yields cells with 15 low Δ PE - OCT4 - GFP signal and lack of X reactivation . Similarly , conditions describing extended 16 potential cells in mouse or humans did not utilize PKCi or SRCi and still used WNT activation together 17 with TANKYRASE inhibition ( Yang et al . , 2017 ) , explaining again why these cells have unique 18 characteristics , they fail to contain naïve pluripotency defining features and cannot sustain stable in vitro 19 naive pluripotency independent of repressive DNA and RNA methylation marks . 5iLA conditions did not 20 include PKCi and did not actively inhibit WNT pathway ( Theunissen et al . , 2014 ) . 21 22 Equivalent to what has been previously established for rodent ESCs in 3i conditions ( Ying et al . , 23 2008 ) , we now establish the ability to expand transgene independent human naïve PSCs independent of 24 any exogenous cytokine supplementation ( i . e . without LIF or ACTIVIN ) and by only inhibiting human 25 PSC autologous driven signaling pathways with small molecule inhibitors . We can also expand bona 26 fide human naïve pluripotent cells by omitting MEK / ERK inhibitors . It will be important to decipher 27 the downstream regulators of pluripotency influenced by NOTCH / RBPj , SRC - NFkB and PKC 28 pathways . We cannot exclude that alternative growth conditions may be devised to capture human 29 naïve pluripotent cells with features similar to those described herein , or that HENSM conditions might 30 23 be modified for improving and consolidating the extent of naïve features in human pluripotent cells . 1 Indeed , X reactivation in the naïve conditions described here in still cannot yield random inactivation 2 upon differentiation of human PSCs and this is similar to previously generated conditions ( Sahakyan et 3 al . , 2016 ) . 4 5 The fact that murine naïve cells , rather than primed cells , are tolerant to ablation of epigenetic 6 repressors supports the concept of naïve pluripotency as a synthesis with a relatively minimal 7 requirement for epigenetic repression ( in comparison to primed pluripotent and somatic cells ) ( Geula et 8 al . , 2015 ; De Los Angeles et al . , 2015 ) . In this study , conditional mutants for METTL3 and DNMT1 9 were used for optimizing more stringent human naïve pluripotency growth conditions . Further , our 10 results in mice and human indicate that the ability to tolerate complete and permanent ablation of such 11 repressors may be one of the key features of naïve pluripotency across different species and might 12 prove an efficient method for defining ground state of pluripotency from other mammalian species in 13 vitro ( e . g . monkeys , bovine , swine ) . 14 15 16 17 Acknowledgements 18 19 This work was funded by Pascal and Ilana Mantoux ; Nella and Leon Benoziyo Center for 20 Neurological Diseases ; David and Fela Shapell Family Center for Genetic Disorders Research ; Kekst 21 Family Institute for Medical Genetics ; Helen and Martin Kimmel Institute for Stem Cell Research ; Flight 22 Attendant Medical Research Council ( FAMRI ) ; Helen and Martin Kimmel Award for Innovative 23 Investigation ; Dr .

HENSM medium was generated 29 by including : 240 ml Neurobasal ( ThermoFisher 21103049 ) and 240ml of DMEM - F12 without HEPES 30 ( ThermoFisher 21331020 ) , 5 ml N2 supplement ( ThermoFisher 17502048 or in - house prepared ) , 5mL 31 GlutaMAX ( ThermoFisher 35050061 ) , 1 % nonessential amino acids ( BI 01 - 340 - 1B ) , 1 % Penicillin - 32 Streptomycin ( BI 03 - 031 - 1B ) , 10ml B27 supplement ( Invitrogen 17504 - 044 or in - house made or 33 Xenofree B27 Invitrogen A1486701 ( for XF conditions ) ) , 0 . 8mM Dimethyl 2 - oxoglutarate ( aKG ) ( add 34 60µL from purchased solution from Sigma 349631 ) , Geltrex ( Invitrogen A1413202 / A1413302 - add 1ml 35 rapidly in media to obtain 0 . 2 % final conc ) , 50µg / ml Vitamin C ( L - Ascorbic acid 2 - phosphate 36 sesquimagnesium salt hydrate - Sigma A8950 ) , 20 ng / ml recombinant human LIF ( Peprotech 300 - 05 ) and 37 the following small molecule inhibitors : MEKi / ERKi ( PD0325901 1 µM - Axon Medchem 1408 ) ; 38 31 WNTi / TNKi ( IWR1 - endo 5µM - Axon Medchem 2510 or XAV939 2µM - Axon Medchem 1527 ) ; 1 P38i / JNKi ( BIRB0796 0 . 8µM - Axon Medchem 1358 ) , PKCi ( Go6983 2µM - Axon Medchem 2466 ) , 2 ROCKi Y27632 ( 1 . 2µM - Axon Medchem 1683 ) , SRCi ( CGP77675 1 . 2µM – Axon Medchem 2097 ) . For 3 HENSM - ACT , the latter HENSM conditions were supplemented with 4 - 20 ng / ml recombinant human 4 ACTIVIN A ( Peprotech 120 - 14E ) . We avoided using β - mercaptoethanol or adding additional BSA . Cells 5 in HENSM were grown on 1 % Growth factor reduced Matrigel ( BD ) or 1 % GELTREX ( ThermoFisher 6 A1413202 or A1413302 ) or Biolaminin - 511 ( Biolamina Inc ; including for HENSM - XF conditions ) 7 coated plates for at least 1 hour in 37 o C . Notably , coated plates with 0 . 2 % gelatin and irradiated ICR - DR4 8 MEFs can also be used to maintain human naïve cells in HENSM conditions . Enhanced single cell 9 cloning efficiency can be obtained with HENSM supplementation with additional 5µM of Y - 27632 10 ROCKi for 24 hours after cell passaging . TrypLE ( ThermoFisher 12604013 or 12604054 ) ( diluted into 11 0 . 5X - EDTA 0 . 75mM ) is optimal for single cell passaging ( 2mL per 10cm dish , 0 . 75ml per 6 well - for 5 12 min at 37°C ) . After removal of TrypLE and air - drying at RT for 3 min . , cells are resuspended in PBS . 13 Rapid 0 . 05 % trypsinization ( 0 . 5 - 1 min at 37C ) is optimal for passaging as small clumps . Longer 0 . 05 % 14 trypsinization for 3 - 5 minutes at 37°C is optimal for microinjection into as the cells come out less sticky . 15 Harvested cells should be centrifuged for 4 min x 1300RPM . Cells were expanded in 5 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 16 conditions and passaged every 4 - 5 days . Medium was freshly replaced every 24 hours . Assembled media 17 can be used for up to 7 days after preparation if kept at 4C . Passage numbers of naïve - hiPSC / hESCs 18 indicate number of passages counted after induction or stabilization of the naïve state ( and do not include 19 previous passages when the cells were established and maintained in other conditions ) . For transfection of 20 mouse and human naïve iPSCs / ESCs , 10 million cells were harvested with 0 . 05 % trypsin - EDTA solution 21 ( Invitrogen ) , and cells resuspended in PBS + / + were transfected with 100 - 150 μ g DNA constructs ( Gene 22 Pulser Xcell System ; Bio - Rad ; 220V , 25 μ F , square wave , 20 ms , 4 mm cuvettes ) . Cell lines were 23 monthly checked for Mycoplasma contaminations ( LONZA – MYCOALERT KIT ) , and all samples 24 analyzed in this study were not contaminated .

For exogenous L - GLUTAMINE withdrawal assay ( “no GLUT 27 assay” ) ( Carey et al . , 2015b ) , media indicated were used without addition of non - essential amino acids , 28 without L - Glutamax , without added aKG , and without Matrigel / Geltrex as some of these components can 29 introduce L - Glut precursors as well . Laminin511 or Gelatin & irradiated feeders were used as coating 30 33 material for no - GLUT assay . 1 2 ESC derivation from human blastocysts in HENSM conditions 3 The use of human preimplantation embryos for ESC derivation was performed in compliance 4 with protocols approved by LIS hospital ESCRO committee , Lis hospital Institutional review committee 5 and Israeli National Ethics Committee ( 7 / 04 - 043 ) and following the acceptance of a written informed 6 consent . The couples ' participation in the study was voluntary after signing informed consent forms and 7 there was no monetary compensation for their embryo donation . Inner cell masses ( ICMs ) were isolated 8 mechanically by laser - assisted micromanipulation from spare IVF embryos , at day 6 - 7 following 9 fertilization . The intact ICM clumps were placed on a feeder cell layer of irradiation treated DR4 mouse 10 embryonic fibroblasts and cultured in HENSM or HENSM - ACT media . Initial outgrowths of 11 proliferating ESCs were evident by days 4 - 8 , and were trypsinized into single cells , 6 - 10 days following 12 ICM plating . The newly established cell lines were further propagated by 0 . 05 % trypsin and then either 13 frozen or used for further analysis . 14 15 Culture of conventional / primed human ESCs and iPSCs 16 The following already established conventional human ESCs and iPSC lines were used 17 ( indicated passage number of the cell line taken for conversion into naïve pluripotency is indicated in 18 parentheses ) : Human induced pluripotent stem cells C1 ( P25 ) hiPSC lines and the human embryonic 19 stem cell ( hESC ) lines H1 ( P42 ) , H9 ( P39 ) , WIBR1 ( P51 ) , WIBR2 ( P44 ) , WIBR3 ( P42 ) , HUES64 , LIS1 , 20 WIS1 , LIS2 hESCs were maintained in 5 % O2 conditions ( unless indicated otherwise ) on irradiated 21 mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) feeder layers or Matrigel coated plates as indicated . Two conventional 22 and established conditions were used as indicated throughout the figures and manuscript : TeSR 23 conditions on Matrigel coated plates ( Stem Cell Technologies ) or FGF / KSR conditions on MEF substrate : 24 DMEM - F12 ( Invitrogen 10829 ) supplemented with 15 % Knockout Serum Replacement ( Invitrogen 25 10828 - 028 ) , 1mM GlutaMAX ( Invitrogen ) , 1 % nonessential amino acids ( Invitrogen ) , 1 % Sodium - 26 pyruvate ( BI 03 - 042 - 1B ) , 1 % Penicillin - Streptomycin ( BI 03 - 031 - 1B ) , 0 . 1mM β - mercaptoethanol 27 ( Sigma ) , and 8ng / mL bFGF ( Peprotech ) and 2ng / ml recombinant human TGF β 1 ( Peprotech ) . Cultures 28 34 were passaged every 5 – 7 days either manually or by trypsinization ( 24 hours pre and 24 hours after 1 addition of ROCK inhibitor at 5 - 10µM concentration ) . For transfection of hiPSC and hESC lines , cells 2 were cultured in Rho kinase ( ROCK ) inhibitor ( Y27632 ) 24 h before electroporation . Primed human ESC 3 and iPSC cells were harvested with 0 . 25 % trypsin - EDTA solution ( Invitrogen ) , and cells resuspended in 4 PBS were transfected with 75 μ g DNA constructs ( Gene Pulser Xcell System ; Bio - Rad ; 250 V , 500 μ F , 5 0 . 4 - cm cuvettes ) . Cells were subsequently plated on MEF feeder layers ( DR4 MEFs for puromycin or 6 neomycin selection ) in hESC medium supplemented with ROCK inhibitor for the first 24 hours , and then 7 antibiotic selection was applied . Previously described 5iLA or 4iLA were assembled and applied as 8 previously described ( Theunissen et al . , 2016 ) . T2iL - Go reset and PXGL conditions were used and 9 assembled as previously described ( Brendenkamp et al . , 2019a ; Takashima et al . , 2014b ) . Media for 10 extended potential stem cells or region specific primed cells were also devised where indicated as 11 originally reported ( Wu et al . , 2015 ; Yang et al . , 2017 ) . 12 13 Mouse naïve and primed stem cell lines and cultivation 14 Murine naïve V6 . 5 ESCs ( C57B6 / 129sJae ) pluripotent cells were maintained and expanded in 15 serum - free chemically defined N2B27 - based media : 240 ml Neurobasal ( ThermoFisher 21103049 ) and 16 240ml of DMEM - F12 with HEPES ( SIGMA D6421 ) , 5ml N2 supplement ( Invitrogen ; 17502048 ) , 5ml 17 B27 supplement ( Invitrogen ; 17504044 ) , 2mM glutamine ( Invitrogen ) , 1 % nonessential amino acids 18 ( Invitrogen ) , 0 . 1mM β - mercaptoethanol ( Sigma ) , 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) , 5mg / ml BSA 19 ( Sigma ) .

Where indicated 2i was added : small - molecule inhibitors CHIR99021 ( CH , 3 μ M - Axon 21 Medchem ) and PD0325901 ( PD , 1 μ M – Axon Medchem 1408 ) . Murine naïve ESCs and iPSCs were 22 expanded on gelatin - coated plates , unless indicated otherwise . Primed 129Jae EpiSC line ( derived from 23 E6 . 5 embryos ) or C57BL6 / 129sJae EpiSC line ( derived following in vitro priming of V6 . 5 mouse ESCs ) 24 were expanded in N2B27 with 12ng / ml recombinant human bFGF ( Peprotech ) and 20ng / ml recombinant 25 Human ACTIVIN A ( Peprotech ) . Murine EpiSC were expanded on feeder free Matrigel coated plates . 26 Cell lines were routinely checked for Mycoplasma contaminations every month ( LONZA – 27 MYCOALERT KIT ) , and all samples analyzed in this study were not contaminated . 28 29 35 Reprogramming of somatic cells and cell infection 1 Virus - containing supernatants of the different reprogramming viruses : STEMCCA - OKSM 2 polycistronic vector ( DOX inducible and constitutive expression ) was supplemented with the FUW - lox - 3 M2rtTA virus ( when necessary ) and an equal volume of fresh culture medium for infection . For 4 derivation of iPSCs directly from fibroblasts ( and not from already established iPSC lines ) , fibroblasts 5 were grown in the presence of DOX in HENSM conditions on Matrigel - coated plates until initial iPSC 6 colonies were observed and subcloned . Generation of JH1 hiPSCs from human PBMCs was conducted by 7 OSKM Sendai virus Cyto - Tune - iPS2 . 0 Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions but in HENSM 8 conditions applied starting from day 4 of the reprogramming process . 9 Sources of cell lines and plasmids 10 WIBR3 - OCT4 - GFP knock in reporter ESCs and Δ PE - OCT4 - GFP WIBR3 hESCs were 11 previously described ( Theunissen et al . , 2016 ) . 29 - 8 WIBR2 and 29 - 9 WIBR2 hESCs reporters for X 12 chromosome reactivation were previously described ( Theunissen et al . , 2016 ) . Targeting strategy and 13 CRIPS / Cas9 used for targeting of human ESCs are delineated in supplementary figures . Correct targeting 14 was validated by southern blot analysis and normal karyotype was revalidated before use of all generated 15 new lines or subclones . Klf17 - / - mouse ESCs ( and its littermate control WT ESC ) were derived from 16 blastocysts obtained following mating of Klf17 - / - adult mice . ßCAT - ERT transgenic construct and ßCat - 17 KO mESCs were previously described and validated ( Kim et al . , 2013 ) . pBabe - Puro - IKBalpha - mut 18 ( super - repressor ) ( dominant negative mutant ) ( Addgene 15291 ) and its control pBabe - Puro - IKBalpha - 19 WT ( Addgene 15290 ) were used to generate transgenic lines analyzed in Fig . 5h . TET - OFF DNMT1 20 HUES64 hESC line was previously described and validated ( Liao et al . , 2015 ) . H9 hNanog - pGZ hESC 21 that contains NANOG - GFP reporter was obtained from WiCell . 22 23 Mouse embryo micromanipulation and imaging 24 Human naïve pluripotent iPSCs were treated with 20 μ M ROCKi the night before injection and 25 trypsinized and microinjected into E2 . 5 BDF2 diploid morulas or aggregated with 2 - Cell BDF2 embryos , 26 and were subsequently allowed to develop in vitro until E3 . 5 ( in KSOM medium ) . Microinjection into 27 E2 . 5 morulas placed in M16 medium under mineral oil was done by a flat - tip microinjection pipette . A 28 36 controlled number of 4 - 8 cells were injected into the morulas . After injection , morulas were returned to 1 KSOM media ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 - 20 um ROCKi for 4h , then transferred to KSOM 2 without ROCKi and placed at 37 o C until transferred to recipient females at E3 . 5 . Ten to fifteen injected 3 blastocysts were transferred to each uterine horn of 2 . 5 days post coitum pseudo - pregnant females . 120 - 4 150 embryos were obtained and transferred for each injection batch . Embryos were dissected at the 5 indicated time points and imaged for GFP + cell localization . The latter experiments were approved by 6 Weizmann Institute IACUC ( 00330111 - 2 ) and by the Weizmann Institute Bioethics and ESCRO 7 committee . In Toto confocal imaging of chimeric mouse embryos was conducted after that the embryos 8 were removed from the uterus into Tyrode’s solution , the decidua removed and the embryo carefully 9 isolated with yolk sac intact . Embryos were moved into a droplet of culture media on a paper filter 10 attached to a coverslip with vacuum grease . Starting farthest away from the embryo , the yolk sac was 11 gently peeled open and lightly pressed onto the paper filter , which has adherence qualities , to anchor the 12 embryo to the filter . To expose the tissue of interest , the embryo can be stretched and lightly pressed onto 13 the filter . After mounting the embryos , a glass - bottomed dish was placed over the embryos using vacuum 14 grease drops for spacing . The dish was inverted , filled with culture media and placed in the imaging 15 chamber on an inverted Zeiss confocal LSM700 microscope . No blinding or randomization was 16 conducted when testing outcome of microinjection experiments . Mounted embryos were placed in a heat - 17 and humidity - controlled chamber ( 37°C ; 5 % O2 , 5 % CO2 and 90 % N2 gas mixture ) on a motorized stage 18 of an inverted Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope . Images were acquired with a 20x / 0 . 8 M27 lens with 19 0 . 5 - 0 . 6x digital zoom - out or 10x / 0 . 3 Ph1 M27 lens with 0 . 5 - 0 . 6x digital zoom - out . For GFP detection , a 20 448 - nm laser ( 30 - 50 % power ) was used . Orange - Tracker ( Molecular Probes , cat # C2927 . Used at 20 21 μ M ) was excited by a 555 - nm laser ( 30 % power ) .

The day after , samples were subjected to increasing 28 gradient of OCT concentration in Sucrose / PBS followed by embedding in OCT on dry ice and stored at - 29 80°C until further processing . Cryoblocks were cut with LEICA CM1950 and washed once with 1xPBS 30 38 and incubated with 0 . 3 % H 2 O 2 for 20 min . After permeabilization with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 10 1 min . , slides were again washed three times with 1xPBS for 2 min . each and blocked with blocked in 10 % 2 normal donkey serum in PBS in humidified chamber for 20 min . at RT . Antibody incubations were 3 carried out analogously to PFE stainings . All images were collected on a Zeiss ( Oberkochen , Germany ) 4 LSM700 confocal microscope and processed with Zeiss ZenDesk and Adobe Photoshop CS4 ( Adobe 5 Systems , San Jose , CA ) . For FACS analysis of mouse embryos , they were harvested and washed once in 6 PBS . Thereafter , they were trypsinized in 0 . 05 % trypsin / EDTA for 5 min and filtered through a cell 7 strainer in MEF - medium before subjected to FACS analysis using FACS ARIA III analyzer and sorter 8 system . Non - injected mouse embryos were used for proper gating and exclusion of auto - fluorescence . 9 10 Luciferase activity assays 11 WNT TOP - Flash reporter constructs ( ten Berge et al . , 2011 ) were used to determine the 12 regulation pattern of WNT signalling activity and were electroporated into 0 . 5 – 3 × 10−6 cells along 13 with the pRL - TK ( Renilla ) vector for normalization .

Blots were developed using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate ( Thermo 20 Scientific 34580 ) . 21 22 Whole - Genome Bisulfite Sequencing ( WGBS ) Library preparation 23 DNA was isolated from cells using the Quick - gDNA miniprep kit ( Zymo ) . DNA ( 50ng ) was then 24 converted by bisulfite using the EZ DNA Methylation - Gold kit ( Zymo ) . Libraries were prepared using the 25 TruSeq kit ( Illumina ) and length distribution of each library was measured using the Bioanalyzer and 26 product concentration was measured using Qubit Fluorometric Quantitation . For sequencing , the 27 libraries , NextSeq 500 / 550 High Output v2 kit ( 150 cycles ) was used . The following secure token has 28 42 been created to allow review of record GSE125555 while it remains in private status : 1 https : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / geo / query / acc . cgi ? acc = GSE125555 2 3 Whole - Genome Bisulfite Sequencing ( WGBS ) analysis 4 The sequencing reads were aligned to the human hg19 reference genome ( UCSC , 2009 ) , using a 5 proprietary script based on Bowtie2 . In cases where the two reads were not aligned in a concordant 6 manner , the reads were discarded . Methylation levels of CpGs calculated by WGBS were unified . Mean 7 methylation was calculated for each CpG that was covered by at least 5 distinct reads ( X5 ) . Average 8 methylation level was calculating by taking the average over all covered X5 covered CpG sites in that 9 genome . 10 11 ChIP - seq library preparation 12 Cells were crosslinked in formaldehyde ( 1 % final concentration , 10 (cid:3) min at room temperature ) or 13 double crosslinked in DSG / formaldehyde ( 2 mM DSG , 30 min at room temperature ) , then formaldehyde 14 1 % final concentration , 10 (cid:3) min at room temperature ) as detail bellow per antibody , and then quenched 15 with glycine ( 2 . 5M 5 (cid:3) min at room temperature ) . Cells were lysed in 50 (cid:3) mM HEPES KOH pH (cid:3) 7 . 5 , 16 140 (cid:3) mM NaCl , 1 (cid:3) mM EDTA , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 alternative , 0 . 25 % Triton supplemented with 17 protease inhibitor at 4 (cid:3) °C ( Roche , 04693159001 ) for 10 min , and later centrifuged at 950 g for 10 (cid:3) min . 18 Supernatant was discarded and pellet was resuspended in RIPA - 1 ( 0 . 2 % SDS , 1 (cid:3) mM EDTA , 0 . 1 % DOC , 19 140 (cid:3) mM NaCl and 10 mM Tris - HCl ) with protease inhibitor . Cells were then fragmented with a Branson 20 Sonifier ( model S - 450D ) at −4 (cid:3) °C to size ranges between 200 and 800 (cid:3) bp and centrifugation at max 21 speed for 10 min . Supernatant lysate was extracted and diluted with RIPA 2 - 3 - fold ( 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 (cid:3) mM 22 EDTA , 0 . 1 % DOC , Triton 1 % , 140 (cid:3) mM NaCl and 10 mM Tris - HCl ) . Small amount of lysate were saved 23 for whole cell extract at this point . Antibody was pre - bound by incubating with Protein - G Dynabeads 24 ( Invitrogen 10004D ) in blocking buffer ( PBS supplemented with 0 . 5 % TWEEN and 0 . 5 % BSA ) for 1 (cid:3) h 25 at room temperature . Washed beads were added to the lysate for incubation as detail per antibody . 26 Samples were washed five times with RIPA buffer , twice with RIPA buffer supplemented with 500 (cid:3) mM 27 NaCl , twice with LiCl buffer ( 10 (cid:3) mM TE , 250mM LiCl , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % DOC ) , once with TE 28 ( 10Mm Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 1mM EDTA ) , and then eluted in 0 . 5 % SDS , 300 (cid:3) mM NaCl , 5 (cid:3) mM EDTA , 29 10 (cid:3) mM Tris HCl pH (cid:3) 8 . 0 . Eluate was incubated treated sequentially with RNaseA ( Roche , 30 43 11119915001 ) for 30 (cid:3) min in 37°C and proteinase K ( NEB , P8102S ) for 2 (cid:3) h in 37°C and de - crosslinked 1 in 65 (cid:3) °C for 8 (cid:3) h . DNA was purified with Agencourt AMPure XP system ( Beckman Coulter Genomics , 2 A63881 ) . Libraries of cross - reversed ChIP DNA samples were prepared according to a modified version 3 of the Illumina Genomic DNA protocol , as described previously ( Rais et al . , 2013 ) .

H3K27ac – 12 crosslinked , cell amount : 5 million , antibody : 5ug ab4729 Abcam , incubation time : 6 hours . 13 14 ChIP - seq analysis 15 We analyzed Chip - seq data of the following DNA - binding proteins : NANOG , SOX2 , OCT4 , 16 KLF4 , KLF17 , TFAP2C , H3K27AC , in HENSM or primed conditions , with replicates or triplicates for 17 each antibody per single condition . For alignment and peak detection , we used bowtie2 software to align 18 reads to human hg19 reference genome ( UCSC , 2009 ) , with default parameters . We identified enriched 19 intervals of all measured proteins using MACS version 1 . 4 . 2 - 1 . We used sequencing of whole - cell extract 20 as control to define a background model . Duplicate reads aligned to the exact same location are excluded 21 by MACS default configuration . The number of peaks in Primed conditions were in - par with previous 22 publications ( e . g . PMID 25409831 , PMID 19829295 , Supplementary Table S5 ) . Peaks that were 23 observed in at least two replicates were kept for further analysis . Peaks were assigned to genes using 24 Homer software ( Supplementary Table S5 ) . Motif enrichment analysis was performed using Homers 25 findmotifsgenome . pl , with parameter - size 50 ( Supplementary Table S4 ) . Significance of overlap 26 between TF targets was calculated using Fisher exact test ( Figure 6h ) . 27 28 RNA - seq library preparation 29 44 Total RNA was isolated from indicated cell lines and extracted from Trizol pellets by chloroform - 1 phenol extraction protocol , then cleaned using Ribo - Zero ( Illumina Ribo - Zero Plus rRNA Depletion Kit , 2 ID - 20037135 ) or Poly - A ( Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT Kit ( Invitrogen ) , ID - 61012 ) depletion Kits . 3 Cleaned RNA was next utilized for RNA - Seq by ScriptSeq Preparation Kit v2 ( Illumina ) according to 4 manufacturer’s instruction . 5 6 RNA - seq analysis 7 hESCs grown in naïve and primed conditions , from different cell lines ( LIS41 , LIS49 , WIBR2 , 8 WIBR3 , H1 , H9 , HUES64 ) were used for RNA - seq analysis . Overall 36 samples were sequenced using 9 poly - A single - end strategy , and 19 samples were sequenced using ribo - zero paired - end strategy . STAR 10 software version 2 . 5 . 2b was used to align reads to human GRCh38 reference genome ( 2013 ) , using the 11 following flags : - - outFilterMultimapNmax 1 - - outReadsUnmapped Fastx - - twopassMode Basic - - 12 outSAMstrandField intronMotif . Read count values were estimated with HTSeq V0 . 7 . 2 software over 13 all aligned reads using GRCh38 general feature format ( GFF ) , with the following flags : - a 10 - s no - t 14 exon - i gene _ id . Mitochondrial and ribosomal genes were filtered out . Genes with a sum count across 15 all samples < 10 , were filtered out as well . The filtering was done independently in each analysis , 16 therefore the number of genes included may change , as it is dependent on the samples that were included 17 for that analysis . Count values were normalized using R DESeq2 V1 . 26 software , and corrected for batch 18 effects using R Limma V3 . 42 . Variance stabilizing transformation was performed to all datasets as well . 19 Dataset analysis and plotting was performed by R V3 . 6 . Sample correlation was performed using 20 Spearman method . Hierarchical clustering was carried out using “complete” or “Ward . D2” methods . 21 Heatmap plots were first Z - scored by sample to better emphasize gene separation . Differentially 22 expressed genes between Naïve and Primed samples were performed by the following parameters : 23 log2 ( Fold change ) > 2 or log2 ( Fold change ) < - 2 , and adjusted p - value < 0 . 1 . RNA - Seq data are deposited 24 under GEO no . GSE125555 . 25 26 ATAC - seq library preparation 27 Cells were trypsinized and counted , 50 , 000 cells were centrifuged at 500 g for 3 min , followed by 28 a wash using 50 μ l of cold PBS and centrifugation at 500 g for 3 min . Cells were lysed using cold lysis 29 buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 10 mM NaCl , 3 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 1 % IGEPAL CA - 630 ) . Immediately 30 45 after lysis , nuclei were spun at 500 g for 10 min using a refrigerated centrifuge . Next , the pellet was 1 resuspended in the transposase reaction mix ( 25 μ l 2× TD buffer , 2 . 5 μ l transposase ( Illumina ) and 22 . 5 2 μ l nuclease - free water ) . The transposition reaction was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C and immediately 3 put on ice . Directly afterwards , the sample was purified using a Qiagen MinElute kit . Following 4 purification , the library fragments were amplified using custom Nextera PCR primers 1 and 2 for a total 5 of 12 cycles . Following PCR amplification , the libraries were purified using a QiagenMinElute Kit and 6 sequenced . 7 8 ATAC - seq analysis 9 Reads were aligned to hg19 human genome using Bowtie2 with the parameter - X2000 ( allowing 10 fragments up to 2 kb to align ) . Duplicated aligned reads were removed using Picard MarkDuplicates tool 11 with the command REMOVE _ DUPLICATES = true . To identify chromatin accessibility signal we 12 considered only short reads ( ≤ 120bp ) that correspond to nucleosome free region . To detect and separate 13 accessible loci in each sample , we used MACS version 1 . 4 . 2 - 1 with - - call - subpeaks flag ( PeakSplitter 14 version 1 . 0 ) . To generate the final ATAC loci of naïve and primed conditions , we selected peaks that 15 appear in the majority of the replicates of each condition , i . e . 3 out of 4 naïve samples , and 2 out of 3 16 primed samples . 17 18 Enhancer Identification 19 H3K27ac peaks were detected using MACS version 1 . 4 . 2 - 1 and merged for each condition 20 ( naïve and primed ) using bedtools merge command . All ATAC peaks were filtered to include only peaks 21 which co - localized with the merged H3K27ac peaks in at least one condition . Finally , peaks that co - 22 localized with promoter or exon regions based on hg19 assembly ( UCSC , 2009 ) were filtered out . Finally , 23 we were left with defined genomic intervals which we annotated as enhancers . 24 25 SNP Score Calculation from WGS 26 SNP score calculation was done as previously described ( Bar et al . , 2017 ) . Briefly , we 27 downloaded WGS data for H1 and H9 cell lines from the SRA database 28 ( http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / sra ) . The files were extracted using SRAtools and aligned to the hg19 29 reference genome using BWA . SAMtools was used to convert from SAM to BAM . We then detected 30 46 polymorphisms with the same pipeline as described previously for RNA - seq ( without filtering for 1 FPKM ) . In order to test if genomic SNPs are properly detected in the RNA - seq analysis , we extracted 2 SNPs from exons of control pluripotent genes and calculated the average percentage of overlapping SNPs 3 between WGS and RNA - seq of the appropriate H1 and H9 samples . In order to test if there is a difference 4 in the existence of genomic SNPs between imprinted genes governed by maternal and paternal gDMR , we 5 extracted the SNPs located at exons of imprinted genes from WGS of H1 and H9 cell lines and then 6 calculated the percentage of genes with genomic SNPs in each group . We used a chi - square test , which 7 confirmed that the bias was not significant . 8 9 Quantifying X : A allelic ratio 10 X : A allelic ration was done as previously described ( Bar et al . , 2019 ) . Briefly , to generate a 11 quantifiable score of allelic expression across the X chromosome , we developed the X : Autosomes ( X : A ) 12 allelic ratio . For this we first counted the number of biallelic SNPs in each chromosome . Since our 13 analysis is based on expressed SNPs , this sum is expected to be dependent on the number of genes in the 14 chromosome . Therefore , to overcome this bias we generated a normalized SNP sum by dividing the SNP 15 sum with the number of known genes in each chromosome . We validated that the average of this 16 normalized SNP sum was similar across all autosomes . Next , for each sample we calculated the ratio of 17 normalized SNP sum of X chromosome and the average normalized SNP sum of autosomes : 18 19 NS ( normalized sum ) = Sum ( biallelic SNPs ) / No . of genes in chromosome 20 X : A allelic ratio = X chromosome - NS / Average ( Autosome - NS ) 21 22 By comparing the normalized sum of X and autosomes within each sample , we avoid potential 23 biases which are due to coverage and batch issues . Samples with very low normalized SNP sums in 24 autosomes ( for example haploid samples or their diploid genetic match which are completely 25 homozygous ) , were discarded from this analysis . 26 27 Transposon expression profiling 28 TE profiling was performed as previously described ( Theunissen et al . , 2016 ) . For repetitive 29 sequences an D . Trono lab curated version of the Repbase database was used ( fragmented LTR and 30 47 internal segments belonging to a single integrant were merged ) . TEs counts were generated using the 1 multiBamCov tool from the bedtools software . TEs which did not have at least one sample with 20 reads 2 ( after normalizing for sequencing depth ) were discarded from the analysis . TEs overlapping exons were 3 also removed from the analysis . Normalisation for sequencing depth and differential gene expression 4 analysis was performed using Voom ( Law et al . , 2014 ) as it has been implemented in the limma package 5 of Bioconductor ( Gentleman et al . , 2004 ) . A gene ( or TE ) was considered to be differentially expressed 6 when the fold change between groups was bigger than 2 and the p - value was smaller than 0 . 05 . A 7 moderated paired t - test ( as implemented in the limma package of R ) was used to test significance . P - 8 values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini - Hochberg’s method ( Benjamini , 1995 ) . 9 Single cell RNA - Seq data was downloaded from GEO ( Edgar et al . , 2002 ) ( GSE36552 ) . Data was 10 mapped and processed as explained above . When merging with in - house RNA - Seq , only TEs which were 11 expressed in both datasets were used . To be considered expressed , the TE needed to have at least as many 12 reads across all samples as samples existed in each dataset . Correspondence between naive / primed ESCs 13 and single cell expression data from human embryonic stages w ` s also done as described before 14 ( Theunissen et al . , 2016 ) . For every cell state we perform a statistical test to find the genes ( or TEs ) that 15 have a different expression level compared to the other cell states ( Yan et al . , 2013 ) . For this we use a 16 moderated F - test ( comparing the interest group against every other ) as implemented in the limma package 17 of Bioconductor . For a gene ( or TE ) to be selected as expressed in a specific cell state it needs to have a 18 significant p - value ( < 0 . 05 after adjusting for multiple testing with the Benjamini and Hochberg method ) 19 and an average fold change respective to the other cell states greater than 10 . Note that with this approach 20 a gene ( or TE ) can be marked as expressed in more than one cell state . Once we have the genes ( or TEs ) 21 that are expressed in a specific cell state we ask if those genes are more expressed in primed or in naive . 22 For that we see how many of the genes are up ( or down ) regulated in the primed / naive pairwise 23 comparison . For a gene to be considered differentially expressed it needs to have a p - value ( after multiple 24 testing correction with the Benjamini and Hochberg method ) lower than 0 . 05 and a fold change greater 25 than 2 . 26 27 28 Figure Legends 29 48 1 Figure 1 .

Western blot analysis for DNMT1 expression 13 in HENSM conditions supplemented with either DOX of BRAF inhibitor ( SB590885 – 0 . 25µM ) . Please 14 note that DOX ablates DNMT1 expression and that BRAFi depletes DNMT1 expression to much lower 15 levels than seen in HENSM conditions ( without DOX ) , yet still they retain residual DNMT1 expression 16 that is necessary for their survival and viability when BRAFi is added to HENSM conditions . i . DNMT1 17 TET - OFF ESC clone was maintained in the presence of DOX for up to 4 passages in different conditions 18 and stained for OCT4 to quantify percentage of cells that retained their pluripotency . Graph shows that 19 only HENSM and HENSM - ACT conditions ( with and without MEFs ) maintain robust expansion of 20 dome - like undifferentiated human PSCs in vitro . Omitting TNKi and SRCi ( in other words WNTi and 21 SRCi ) form HENSM leads to loss of ability to maintain DNMT1 depleted human naïve PSCs , as evident 22 from loss of OCT4 + cells . j . Mouse or human ESCs carrying NANOG - GFP pluripotency reporter were 23 expanded in the indicated naïve and primed conditions in the absence of exogenous L - Glutamine 24 supplementation for 4 passages . Percentage of pluripotent cells was quantified based on GFP expression 25 levels . Graph shows that only HENSM and HENSM - ACT conditions ( with and without irradiated feeder 26 cells – MEFs ) maintain expansion and stability of human NANOG + pluripotent cells when exogenous L - 27 Glutamine is omitted , and that this is similar to 2iL conditions on mouse naïve ESCs . Omitting TNKi and 28 SRCi form HENSM leads to loss of ability to maintain human naïve PSCs without exogenous L - 29 Glutamine supplementation , as evident from loss of NANOG - GFP + cells . 30 50 Figure 3 . HENSM endows human PSCS with canonical naïve - like transcriptional features . 1 a . Unbiased hierarchical clustering was performed on RNA - seq measurement obtained from different 2 human ESC and iPSCs expanded in HENSM , HENSM - ACT naïve and TeSR primed conditions .

Cell Stem Cell 2016 ) , Reset conditions ( Naïve Reset * , 5 Takashima et al . Cell 2014 – composed of NANOG - KLF2 transgenes and 2iLGo ) or Primed conditions 6 ( Primed * ) . Figure shows that HENSM and HENSM - ACT conditions ( Dark blue ) resemble 5iLA and 7 Reset conditions ( light blue ) and cluster separately from primed cells ( Red and orange ) . b .
