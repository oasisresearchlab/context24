Dr . Bretscher ' s present address is the Department of Cell Biology , The University of Texas Health Science Center at Dallas , Dallas , Texas 75235 . ABSTRACT (cid:9) A 68 , 000 mol wt polypeptide has been identified as one of the few major proteins in the microfilament bundles of the microvilli present on intestinal epithelial cells . Antibodies against the purified protein have been used in indirect immunofluorescence microscopy on several cultured cells . The protein is found particularly prominent in membrane ruffles , microspikes , and microvilli . Microfilaments , one of the three cytoskeletal filamentous sys - tems of eucaryotic cells , have been implicated both in the maintenance of cell shape and in several cellular motile phe - nomena ( for a review , see reference 10 ) . Over the last five years , several proteins have been identified by immunofluores - cence microscopy as components of the microfilament bundles of tissue culture cells . Antibodies to actin ( 15 ) , myosin ( 25 ) , tropomyosin ( 12 ) , a - actinin ( 14 ) , and filamin ( 7 ) have shown these proteins as being present along microfilament bundles . Recently , a new protein , vinculin , was found to be enriched in the areas of the cell where these bundles attach to the substra - tum ( 6 ) . Some of these proteins show a restricted distribution ; for example , myosin and tropomyosin cannot be detected in the highly motile cellular areas , such as the ruffles , whereas actin , a - actinin , and filamin are all prominent components ( 7 , 12 , l3 ) . In addition , besides actin , none of these proteins has been found in the microvilli of the intestinal epithelial cells ( l , 5 , 20 ) . Although the limited sensitivity of the immunofluores - cence technique does notrule out the possible presence of small amounts of some of these components in the membrane ruffle and intestinal microvillus , it strongly suggests that different arrangements of microfilaments with different associated pro - teins exist . In the case of the microvillus , the results are strengthened by biochemical studies ( 2 , 3 , 16 ) which were unable to detect myosin , tropomyosin , filamin , or a - actinin in isolated microvilli . Indeed , it is to be expected that different microfilament arrangements exist in view of the wide variety of functions attributed to these structures in nonmuscle cells ( 10 ) . All the microfilament - associated proteins discussed above were initially identified by raising antibodies to proteins iso - lated from muscle tissues . It seems likely , therefore , that new proteins will be found in nonmuscle cells associated with those microfilaments which provide structural support or which are involved in motile processes not based on the actomyosin iti [ JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY - VOLUME 86 July 1980 335 - 340 © The Rockefeller University Press - 0021 - 9525 / 80 / 07 / 0335 / 06 $ 1 . 00 interaction . Presently , it is not easy to isolate intact microfila - ments from tissue culture cells in order to establish which proteins are associated with which system of microfilaments . We have chosen to study the core bundle of the microvilli present on intestinal epithelial cells as a model system for one type of microfilament arrangement in nonmuscle cells . Cells of the intestinal epithelium each have about one thou - sand microvilli on their apical surface as part of a structure known as the brush border . Nearly twenty years ago , Miller and Crane ( 17 ) developed a method for the rapid isolation of intestinal brush borders . Since then , a method has been devel - oped for the purification of microvilli from disrupted brush borders ( 2 ) , so allowing a biochemical and ultrastructural analysis of the cytoskeleton of the microvillus . The core of the microvillus is a highly ordered bundle of microfilaments at - tached to the membrane both at the tip of the microvillus and laterally down its length by a series of regularly spaced cross - filaments ( 3 , 4 , 19 , 21 ) . This simple structure contains anumber ofproteins besides actin ( 2 , 16 ) . Recently we described amajor protein ( mol wt 95 , 000 ) ofthe microvillus core , which we called villin ( 3 ) and which we have so far been unable to detect in tissue culture cells . Here we describe a second major protein ( mol wt 68 , 000 ) from the microvillus core which is also present in membrane ruffles of tissue culture cells and in structures containing highly ordered microfilament bundles . As this pro - tein appears to be preferentially associated with surface struc - tures of cells , we propose the name fimbrin ( from the Latin " fimbria , " meaning border , fringe ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation of Fimbrin Highly purified brush borders ( 2 ) were extracted for 30 min at 0°C in 0 . 6 M KI , I mM CaCl , , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 20 mM Tris - HCI , pH 7 . 8 . Theextracted material 335 was recovered as the supernatant fraction after centrifugation at 100 , 000 g for l h . The extract was then dialyzed for 3 h against 51 of the G - actin buffer of Spudich and Watt ( 24 ) , during which time much of the myosin precipitated and was subsequently removed by centrifugation . This low salt extract was fraction - ated by adding 45 % ammonium sulfate whichprecipitatedmost ofthe cytoskeletal proteins with the exceptions offimbrin , andsome ofthe villin andactin . Fimbrin was isolated from the 45 % ammonium sulfate soluble material by preparative SDSgel electrophoresis ( 15 ) . During the isolation of fimbrin , all buffers included 0 . 25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to reduce proteolysis . Immunological Techniques Antibodies to fimbrin were elicited in rabbits . Affinity purified antibodies were prepared from the positive sera using a Sepharose column to which fimbrin was covalently attached . The affinity purified antibodies to actin and chicken gizzard a - actinin have been described ( 26 ) . Fluorescein labeled goat - anti - rabbit lgGs were purchased from Miles - Yeda , Israel and preabsorbed extensively on methanol - fixed chick embryo fibroblasts before use at a final concentration of - 0 . 4 mg / ml . Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy on intestinal epithelial cells has been described ( I ) . Immunofluorescence microscopy on tissue culture cells was performed on cells fixed and made permeable by a 5 - min incubation in - 20°C methanol . Cells attached to coverslips were then immediately washed in phosphate - buffered saline and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy ( 15 ) . Gel Electrophoresis Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence ofsodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS PAGE ) was performed as described ( 11 ) . Theimmune replica method was performed using , ' °I - labeled protein A to detect immune complexes ( 23 ) . RESULTS The Brush - border 68 , 000 Protein is a Component of the Microvillus Core Highly purified brush borders can readily be prepared from the small intestine of the chicken ( 19 ) . Removal of the mem - brane by treatment with Triton X - 100 reveals the brush - border cytoskeleton ( 18 ) which contains about half of the total brush - border protein . Because - 15 mg of brush - border cytoskeletal protein can be isolated from a single bird , the brush border provides a rich source of any particular cytoskeletal protein . The polypeptide composition of brush borders and their cyto - skeletons has been documented in part elsewhere ( 2 , 16 , I8 ) ; here we summarize what is known about the distribution of the major proteins between the microvilli and the terminal web region . The polypeptide composition of purified brush borders as analyzed by SDS PAGE is shown in Fig . 1 . Cytoskeletons recovered after treatment of brush borders with Triton X - 100 ( track B ) appear to be intact because essentially none of their major components are found in the Triton X - 100 soluble material ( track C ) and morphological studies have shown that they retain their prominent ultrastructural features ( 18 ) . Anal - ysis of the protein components of the brush - border cytoskeleton reveals several proteins having polypeptide mol wt above 40 , 000 . Prominentspecies of280 , 000 , 250 , 000 , 200 , 000 , 145 , 000 , 110 , 000 , 95 , 000 , 68 , 000 , and 43 , 000 are easily detected . The 250 , 000 , 200 , 000 , 145 , 000 , and 68 , 000 proteins can sometimes be resolved into more than one species . Of these cytoskeletal proteins , the 200 , 000 species has been identified as the heavy chain of myosin ( 20 ) and the 43 , 000 species as a mixture of f3 and y nonmuscle actin ( 2 ) . Higher cross - linked gels ( see , for example , references 2 , 16 , and 18 ) reveal in addition some lower molecular weight components , among which is a doublet at 30 , 000 , identified as typical nonmuscle tropomyosin ( 2 , 18 ) . Purified microvilli ( tract D ) do not contain the 280 , 000 , 250 , 000 , 200 , 000 , 145 , 000 , or 30 , 000 ( not shown ) polypeptides . 336 (cid:9) RAPID COMMUNK : Ar1ONS FIGURE 1 (cid:9) 7 . 5 % SDS PAGE of the polypeptide components of brush borders , microvilli and their cytoskeletons .

Approximate molecular weights are shown at left . M , myosin heavy chains ; V , villin ; F , fimbrin ; A , actin ; FM , filamin , a - A , a - actinin . As discussed previously ( 2 ) , these species are located in the terminal web region of the brush border . Prominent compo - nents of the microvillus cytoskeleton ( track E ) include actin ( 43 , 000 ) and the 110 , 000 , 95 , 000 ( villin ) , and 68 , 000 ( fimbrin ) polypeptides . We have described villin as the major protein associated with actin in the microvillus core ( 3 ) . In agreement with others ( 5 , 16 ) , we now find the 110 , 000 protein to be a relatively major component . Previously we did not detect it as a major species because of its high protease sensitivity , espe - cially in the presence of polyethylene glycol which we used to stabilize the microvillus cores ( 2 ) . In addition to these higher molecular weight components , Howe and Mooseker ( 9 ) re - cently reported that calmodulin is a component of the micro - villus core . We can confirm this result . We have found that purified microvillus cores contain a 16 , 500 polypeptide that comigrates by SDS PAGE with calmodulin , and that immu - nofluorescence microscopy using calmodulin antibody reveals this protein as a component of the microvilli of the brush border . Antibody to Fimbrin Having identified fimbrin as a component of the microvillus core , the protein was isolated from brush borders ( Fig . 2 ) . The brush borders were extracted with a 0 . 6 M KI buffer that solubilizes most of the cytoskeletal proteins . The salt was removed by dialysis against the G - actin buffer of Spudich and Watt ( 24 ) , during which time most of the myosin precipitates . The clarified extract was then subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation , rendering most of the cytoskeletal proteins in - soluble , and leaving fimbrin and some of the actin and villin in the soluble fraction . Fimbrin was then isolated from the supernate by preparative SDS PAGE . Antibodies to fimbrin were elicited in two rabbits . Both animals were found to be positive by immunodiffusion analysis FIGURt 2 7 . 5 % SIDS PAGE of the fractionation steps used in the isolation of fimbrin .

Approximate molecular weights ( x 103 ) are shown at left . against the isolated protein . The sera were further characterized by the immune replica method , where the immunological reaction between a serum and proteins separated by SDS PAGE is determined ( 23 ) . Both sera reacted strongly with a polypeptide of 68 , 000 mot wt present in the microvillus core and in cultured chick embryo fibroblasts ( Fig . 3 ) . Antibodies specific for fimbrin were isolated by affinity chromatography on a column to which the isolated protein was covalently bound . Either these affinity purified antibodies ( at 0 . 05 mg / ml ) , or a 100 - fold dilution of the positive sera , were used in indirect immunofluorescence microscopy . Essentially identical results were obtained using the different antibody preparations . Localization of Fimbrin in Nonmuscle Cells Immunofluorescence microscopy on chicken , mouse , or guinea pig intestinal epithelial cells visualizes fimbrin in the microvilli of the brush border ( Fig . 4 ) . Owing to the intense fluorescence from the microvilli , it is not possible to determine independently at the light microscope level whether fimbrin is also present in the terminal web region of the brush border . Control experiments in which nonimmune first antibody was used in place of the fimbrin antibody showed only weak background fluorescence ( not shown , but see controls in ref - erence 1 ) . In tissue culture cells , structures containing fimbrin could best be seen as cells reattached after replating . Fig . 5 shows chick embryo fibroblasts ( 8 ) 2 . 5 h after replating and viewed in immunofluorescence microscopy after decoration with either antibody to fimbrin ( A - C ) or to actin ( D ) . Fimbrin can be seen to be present in all membrane ruffles , in the microfilament meshwork which lies between the cell body and the ruffling membrane , in surface microvilli , and in microspikes . Weak staining of stress fibers was also seen , particularly in the regions FICURt 3 (cid:9) Immune replica showing the immunological reactivity of oneof the antifimbrin sera to proteins separated by 8 . 5 % SIDS PAGE .

For comparison , two cells stained with antibody to actin ( D ) are shown ; here both the membrane ruffles and stress fibers are strongly stained , giving rise to a staining pattern characteristically different from that obtained with fimbrin antibody . Fimbrin can also be detected in a wide variety of cultured mammalian cells . Fig . 6 shows the edges of two fully spread rat mammary cells ( 22 ) in culture , one stained with antibody to fimbrin and , for comparison , one with antibody to a - actinin . Again the fimbrin antibody stained the membrane ruffle and microspikes , as well as the substratum attachment points ofthe stress fibers ( arrows ) . As described for this and other cell lines ( 15 , 22 , 25 ) , a - actinin is present in the membrane ruffle , attachment points of the stress fibers , and in the stress fibers themselves . Other cell surface structures were examined to see if they also contained fimbrin . Fig . 7A shows a rat mammary cell stained with fimbrin antibody 2 . 5 h after replating . The cell has two rows of large surface microvilli which are probably derived from two large membrane ruffles which passed back on the body of the cell from the periphery .

( 8 ) described virus - induced microvilli found on chick embryo fibroblasts infected with vaccinia virus and reported that these induced microvilli contain both actin and a - actinin . Fig . 7 B shows part of an infected cell covered with virus - induced microvilli and viewed in immunofluorescence micros - copy after decoration with fimbrin antibody . These microvilli as well contain fimbrin as a prominent component . DISCUSSION We have identified the 68 , 000 mot wt polypeptide of the brush border as a major component of the microvillus core . Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with antibody to this protein reveals it as a prominent component of a number of microfil - ament - containing surface structures of nonmuscle cells . These include the membrane ruffle , intestinal epithelial cell micro - villi , microspikes , both the small surface microvilli and the larger microvilli derived from folded - back membrane ruffles , and microvilli induced after infection of fibroblasts with vac - cinia virus . In addition , the 68 , 000 protein is present in the microfilament bundle of the stereocilia found on sensory hair cells of the inner ear ( A . Bretscher and A . Flock , unpublished results ) . It is clearly a protein , therefore , which is associated with both highly ordered microfilament arrangements , such as microvilli , microspikes , and stereocilia , as well as being asso - ciated with the fine microfilament network of the membrane ruffle . It is the first microfilament - associated protein described that is much more prominent in the peripheral microfilament - containing structures of the cell than in the stress fiber system . For this reason we propose the name " fimbrin , " which is derived from the Latin " fimbria , " meaning border or fringe . What is the function of fimbrin ? No obvious function is suggested by its distribution between various cell structures . It is most prominent in those structures that appear to lack myosin and tropomyosin ( such as membrane ruffles , micro - spikes , microvilli [ 1 , 7 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 201 ) and present in structures that either contain filamin and a - actinin ( membrane ruffles [ 7 , 141 ) or appear to lack these proteins ( microvilli ofthe intestinal epithelium [ 11 ) . It is abundant in the highly ordered microfil - ament arrangements so far examined , with the exception of stress fibers . To understand the function of fimbrin , its bio - chemical properties , and its role in at least one of these struc - tures will have to be elucidated . At present , the microfilament core of the microvillus of the intestinal epithelium provides the one highly ordered microfilament arrangement available ultra - structurally intact and in sufficient quantities for biochemical analysis ( 2 ) . This structure contains , in addition to actin and fimbrin , at least three other proteins ( 16 ) . We have recently shown ( manuscript in preparation ) that one of these , villin , has the ability to bundle F actin in vitro and so is probably a microfilament cross - linking protein and not the microfilament - membrane cross - filament protein as previously suggested ( 3 ) . Another microvillus protein , the 110 , 000 polypeptide , has been suggested by Matsudaira and Burgess ( 16 ) to be the true cross - filament protein based on their ultrastructural studies of mi - crovillus cores extracted under various conditions . The fifth protein known to be present in the microvillus core is calmod - ulin ( 9 ) , although its role there is not yet understood . We are currently attempting to determine how these proteins are as - sembled into the microvillus core and we anticipate that these experiments will give some insight into the function of fimbrin . We are very grateful to Dr . Gerhard Hiller for discussions andprovid - ing the chick embryo fibroblasts . We thank Dr . Mary Osborn for actin antibody . Receivedforpublication 10 March 1980 .
