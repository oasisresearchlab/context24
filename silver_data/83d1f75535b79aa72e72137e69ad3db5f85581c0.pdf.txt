CN 22 2 Highlights 23 • ULK1 / 2 interact with PXN and phosphorylate PXN at S32 and S119 in response to 24 mechanical stimuli 25 • ULK1 / 2 - mediated phosphorylation of PXN regulates mechanotransduction and migration of 26 breast cancer cells 27 • ULK1 / 2 modulate the biomaterial properties of focal adhesions through PXN phosphorylation 28 • ULK1 / 2 and FAK / Src act antagonistically in mechanotransduction through competitive 29 phosphorylation of PXN 30 31 Abstract 32 The remodeling and stiffening of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) associated with breast cancers is a 33 well - recognized modulator of disease progression . However , how changes in the mechanical 34 properties of the ECM are converted into biochemical signals that direct tumor cell migration and 35 metastasis remains poorly characterized . Here , we describe a new role for the autophagy - inducing 36 serine / threonine kinases ULK1 and ULK2 in mechanotransduction . We demonstrate that ULK1 / 2 37 activity inhibits the assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions ( FAs ) , and as a consequence 38 impedes cell contraction and migration . Mechanistically , we identify PXN / paxillin , a key component of 39 the mechanotransducing machinery , as a direct binding partner and substrate of ULK1 / 2 . ULK - 40 mediated phosphorylation of PXN at S32 and S119 weakens homotypic interactions and liquid - liquid 41 phase separation of PXN , impairing FA assembly , which in turn impedes the mechanotransduction of 42 breast cancer cells . ULK1 / 2 and the well characterized PXN regulator , FAK / Src , have opposing 43 functions on mechanotransduction and compete for phosphorylation of adjacent serine and tyrosine 44 residues . Thus , our study reveals ULK1 / 2 as important regulators of PXN - dependent 45 mechanotransduction . 46 3 Introduction 47 The extracellular matrix ( ECM ) continuously modulates various aspects of cellular behavior , 48 including division , growth , migration , and death . Cells sense changes in the biochemical composition 49 or mechanical properties of the ECM through focal adhesions ( FAs ) , which are dynamic protein 50 assemblies involved in mechanotransduction . Upon engagement with the ECM , transmembrane 51 heterodimeric integrin receptors recruit numerous FA - associated components , which in turn connect 52 with the actin cytoskeletal network . In response to increasing stiffness , cells actively strengthen 53 opposing contractile and tension forces through actin polymerization and actomyosin motors . In this 54 manner , mechanical cues are converted into biochemical outputs , which include extensive post - 55 translational modifications and changes in protein - protein interactions . 56 Tumor - associated breast tissues exhibit augmented rigidity compared to normal mammary 57 tissues . Indeed , palpation is used as an initial diagnostic method for breast tumors due to their 58 prominently rigid nature . It is now widely appreciated that stiffened ECM instructs invasion of breast 59 cancer cells ( Levental et al . , 2009 ; Riehl et al . , 2020 ) . However , the molecular mechanisms through 60 which breast cancer cells sense and transduce these mechanical signals into biological activities 61 remain less well understood . 62 Most steps in mechanotransduction pathways are energy consuming , requiring 63 approximately 50 % of total cellular ATP ( Bernstein and Bamburg , 2003 ) . Therefore , these pathways 64 are likely to engage in crosstalk with metabolic programs ( Romani et al . , 2021 ; Salvi and DeMali , 65 2018 ) . In principle , metabolism can impinge on mechanotransduction in two distinct manners . First , 66 energy - producing catabolism can fuel processes such as actin polymerization . Alternatively , certain 67 metabolites can directly modulate cellular processes that are essential for mechanotransduction . 68 Preliminary evidence suggests that mechanotransduction and metabolism can be coupled . For 69 instance , the metabolic sensor AMPK is activated in response to mechanical stimuli and stimulates 70 both ATP production and glucose transport ( Bays et al . , 2017 ) , which may in turn reinforce cell 71 adhesions and the actin cytoskeletal network . However , whether AMPK - mediated glucose transport 72 and ATP production or other targets of AMPK , such as ULK1 / 2 , are responsible for the enhanced 73 cell - cell contact remains unclear . 74 ULK1 / 2 are functionally redundant serine / threonine kinases that regulate multiple steps of 75 the autophagy pathway , which targets superfluous or damaged proteins and organelles for 76 lysosomal degradation and recycling to maintain cellular energy homeostasis ( Dikic and Elazar , 77 2018 ; Wang and Kundu , 2017 ; Zachari and Ganley , 2017 ) . Phosphorylation of ULK1 / 2 by AMPK 78 increases flux through the autophagy pathway ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . The inhibition of ULK1 - dependent 79 4 autophagic function under hypoxic conditions has been associated with increased invasion and 80 migration of breast cancer cell lines in vitro and in xenograft models ( Dower et al . , 2017 ) , and 81 although autophagy has been shown to promote FA disassembly and cell motility ( Bressan et al . , 82 2020 ; Kenific et al . , 2016 ; Sharifi et al . , 2016 ) , the role of ULK1 / 2 in mechanotransduction has not 83 been explored . Indeed , the links between mechanotransduction and autophagy remain controversial . 84 Whereas autophagy activity is enhanced via nuclear - localized YAP / TAZ induced by high ECM 85 stiffness ( Totaro et al . , 2019 ) , autophagy can also be increased in cells grown on soft matrix ( Vera - 86 Ramirez et al . , 2018 ) . These observations highlight a context - dependent relationship between these 87 two pathways . Not surprisingly , autophagy can be anti - or pro - tumorigenic depending on the tumor 88 stage and context ( Niklaus et al . , 2021 ) . 89 In examining the relationship between autophagy and mechanotransduction , we made the 90 unexpected discovery that ULK1 and ULK2 negatively regulate mechanotransduction in breast 91 cancer cells . Specifically , we demonstrate that ULK1 / 2 interact directly with the FA scaffold protein 92 PXN / paxillin , and phosphorylate PXN at S32 and S119 in a mechanosensitive manner . 93 Phosphorylation of PXN by ULK1 weakens homotypic interactions , thereby reducing PXN’s ability to 94 drive the assembly of FA condensates in vitro , and decelerating the kinetics of FA assembly in cells , 95 thus compromising mechanotransduction and migration . These observations may help to explain 96 why decreased expression of ULK1 in breast cancer samples is associated with a worse prognosis . 97 98 Results 99 ULK1 / 2 negatively regulate mechanics of breast cancer cells in an autophagy - independent manner 100 In order to begin exploring the relationship between the ECM , mechanotransduction and autophagy , 101 we collected 6 samples from breast cancer patients along with paired adjacent normal tissues and 102 performed immunoblot analyses . Consistent with previous report ( Levental et al . , 2009 ) , we 103 observed increased levels of certain ECM proteins , including collagen and fibronectin , in the tumor 104 samples compared to normal tissues ( Fig . 1A - 1B ) . Consistent with the results of our sc - RNAseq 105 analyses , tumor samples also showed increased levels of several markers of cellular contraction and 106 integrin signaling , such as α - smooth muscle actin ( α - SMA ) , focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) 107 phosphorylated at Y397 , and PXN phosphorylated at Y118 ( Fig . 1A - 1B ) . We found no detectable 108 change in the protein levels of several key markers ( ATG13 , FIP200 / RB1CC1 , p62 , and LC3II ) of 109 autophagic activity , except ULK1 , whose levels were decreased ( Fig . S1A - 1B ) . 110 5 Due to the well - known cellular complexity of tissues infiltrated by breast cancer , and 111 heterogeneity of breast cancer cells , we sought to identify consistent cell intrinsic differences 112 between normal and malignant breast epithelial cells . Towards this end , we used a publicly available 113 single - cell RNA sequencing ( sc - RNAseq ) dataset to compare gene expression profiles from normal 114 and malignant mammary epithelial cells after computationally separating them from other cell types 115 in the heterogeneous tissue samples ( Pal et al . , 2021 ) . Gene ontology ( GO ) enrichment revealed 116 111 significantly altered cellular processes . Among the top 15 most significant hits , we found 117 prominent enrichment of mitochondria and ribosome - related activities ( Fig . 1C ) , both of which are 118 frequently associated with breast cancers ( Ebright et al . , 2020 ; Li and Li , 2021 ) . Interestingly , the top 119 GO terms also included FA and cell substrate junction , both of which are directly relevant to cellular 120 mechanosensing and transduction ( Fig . 1C ) . We next performed gene set enrichment analysis 121 ( GSEA ) , which revealed that genes related to cell substrate junction , contractile fiber , cell cortex , and 122 actin cytoskeleton were significantly upregulated in the malignant mammary epithelial cells ( Fig . 1D ) . 123 These data highlight the aberrant activation of the mechanotransduction pathway in breast cancer 124 cells compared to normal mammary epithelium . Notably , the abundance of important autophagy - 125 associated genes remained unchanged between normal and malignant cells ( Fig . S1C ) . 126 The reduced levels of ULK1 in cancerous breast tissues drew our attention because ULK1 127 expression has been reported as an independent prognostic factor in breast cancer ( Tang et al . , 128 2012 ) . Using the TCGA database , we independently confirmed the association between the 129 expression of ULK1 and ULK2 and breast cancer prognosis [ i . e . , decreased ULK1 and ULK2 mRNA 130 levels were associated with a significantly ( p = 8 . 9 x 10 − 07 and 0 . 0098 for ULK1 and ULK2 , 131 respectively ) worse prognosis ] ( Fig . 1E ) . 132 To test the effect on ULK1 expression on cell migration , we used a chemoattractant - based 133 transwell assay in which cells are cultured in the upper compartment and allowed to migrate through 134 a microporous membrane into the lower compartment , where chemotactic agents are present . Since 135 highly metastatic breast cancer cells such as MDA - MB - 231 exhibit relatively low levels of ULK1 136 expression compared to those that are less metastatic ( Mao et al . , 2020 ) , we chose to inducibly 137 express ULK1 wildtype ( WT ) , ULK1 kinase dead ( KD , K46A ) , ULK2 WT , or ULK2 KD ( K39T ) in these 138 cells . The steady state levels of ULK1 ( WT and KD ) were higher than that of ULK2 ( WT or KD ) in the 139 stable cell lines ( Fig . S1D ) . Overexpression of ULK1 WT , but not ULK1 KD , strongly impeded cell 140 migration in this assay ( Fig . 1F - 1G ) without any appreciable impact on cell proliferation ( Fig . S1E ) . 141 We also generated ULK1 null HeLa cells , reconstituted them with ULK1 WT or ULK1 KD ( Fig . S1F ) , 142 and assessed the migratory potentials of these cells using the transwell assay . Again , ULK1 WT , but 143 not ULK1 KD , inhibited cell migration in these cells ( Fig . S1G - 1H ) , suggesting that this function of 144 6 ULK1 in tumor cell migration is likely not cell type - specific . Silencing either ULK1 or ULK2 markedly 145 increased migration of HeLa cells ( Fig . S1I - 1J ) , highlighting their functional redundancy . 146 To test whether this inhibitory effect of ULK1 / 2 in cell migration is related to its effects on 147 autophagy , we chose to knock down expression of several key autophagy genes , including ATG13 , 148 FIP200 / RB1CC1 , ATG7 , and ATG14 , and assess the subsequent impact on cell migration ( Fig . 149 S1K ) . Among these , ATG13 and FIP200 form complexes with ULK1 / 2 , ATG7 is required for most 150 known forms of autophagy , and ATG14 is a substrate of ULK1 / 2 during autophagy initiation ( Dikic 151 and Elazar , 2018 ; Park et al . , 2018 ) . Knockdown of ATG13 , ATG7 , or ATG14 did not significantly 152 alter cell migration , whereas knockdown of FIP200 significantly increased cell migration ( Fig . S1L - 153 1M ) . Although recent studies have focused on FIP200’s role in autophagy , FIP200 was initially 154 identified as a direct interactor and regulator of the FA components FAK and Pyk2 ( Ueda et al . , 155 2000 ) . Indeed , FIP200’s regulation of cell motility and focal adhesion stability is independent of its 156 role in autophagy ( Abbi et al . , 2002 ; Assar and Tumbarello , 2020 ) . Taken together , these results 157 suggest that ULK1 / 2 negatively regulate breast cancer cell migration in an autophagy - independent 158 manner . 159 Because MDA - MB - 231 cells are known for extreme morphological and mechanical 160 heterogeneity ( Shen et al . , 2020 ) , for subsequent studies we used HeLa cells for morphological 161 analyses and performed critical functional assays ( e . g . , transwell ) using MDA - MB - 231 cells to test 162 the applicability of our findings in breast cancer cells . 163 Given our finding of the negative correlation between integrin signaling and ULK1 protein 164 levels in patient cells , we hypothesized that ULK1’s inhibition of cell migration may at least in part be 165 related to an inhibitory effect on integrin activation . To test this concept , we next examined signaling 166 proteins downstream of integrin activation in response to manipulation of ULK1 expression or 167 activity . Indeed , overexpression of ULK1 WT was associated with decreased abundance of signaling 168 proteins downstream of integrin activation , including FAK phosphorylated at Y397 and Y925 as well 169 as PXN at Y31 and Y118 ( Fig . 1H , and S1N ) . We next asked if the overall activity of integrin 170 receptors was altered by ULK1 . We took advantage of a well - characterized antibody ( 12G10 ) that 171 specifically recognizes the activated integrin β1 receptor . Indeed , depleting ULK1 led to significantly 172 increased intensities of activated integrin β1 receptor and re - introducing the kinase - active ULK1 173 attenuated the intensities ( Fig . 1I - 1J ) . Because integrin signaling is tightly associated with cell 174 contraction , we performed a 3D collagen contraction assay , which measures the cellular contractile 175 forces towards the matrix , to assess the role of ULK1 in this process . Depleting ULK1 significantly 176 diminished cellular contractile forces , which was reversed by reconstituting kinase active ULK1 ( Fig . 177 1K - 1L ) . Again , this function of ULK1 was unrelated to autophagy since knockdown of other 178 7 representative autophagy proteins did not have similar effects ( S1O - 1P ) . We next employed 179 quantitative traction force microscopy ( TFM ) to evaluate the average cellular contractile force , which 180 was reduced from 200 Pa in ULK1 - / - cells to less than 100 Pa by the expression of functional ULK1 181 ( Fig . 1M - 1N ) . Collectively , these results suggest that ULK1 is a negative regulator of cell contraction 182 and migration . 183 ULK1 / 2 suppress stiffness - dependent cell spreading , actin reinforcement and FA assembly 184 Based on the findings described above , we hypothesize that ULK1 / 2 govern cellular 185 response to mechanical changes of the ECM . To mimic the fluctuating mechanical stimulation of the 186 ECM , we fabricated polyacrylamide ( PA ) gels with various stiffness ranging from 2 . 7 kPa ( soft ) to 187 glass ( stiff ) and used these as substrates for HeLa cell growth . We then collected lysates from these 188 cells and examined markers of cell contraction and integrin signaling by immunoblot . As expected , 189 we found upregulation of α - SMA , phosphorylated myosin light chain 2 ( MLC2 ) , FAK , and PXN with 190 increasing stiffness of the substrate ( Fig . 2A - 2B ) . We also examined metabolic proteins to 191 investigate potential association between mechanotransduction and metabolism . Among proteins we 192 examined , AMPK was significantly activated with increasing substrate stiffness ( Fig . 2A - 2B ) , 193 consistent with the idea that AMPK safeguards the energetic needs for resisting increases in 194 substrate stiffness ( Bays et al . , 2017 ) . mTOR activity was also markedly augmented by higher 195 substrate stiffness , in line with the idea high substrate stiffness promotes cell growth ( Fig . 2A - 2B ) . In 196 contrast to prior studies showing changes in autophagic activity in response to increases in substrate 197 stiffness ( Totaro et al . , 2019 ; Vera - Ramirez et al . , 2018 ) , we found that autophagy flux remained 198 stable , as indicated by unchanged levels of p62 , LC3II , and phosphorylated ATG14 protein ( Fig . 2A - 199 2B ) . Morphologically , cells expressing ULK1 WT showed significantly shrunken size and disrupted 200 actin remodeling compared to those expressing no ULK1 or KD ULK1 ( Fig . 2C - E , and S2A ) , 201 suggesting that ULK1 negatively governs cellular mechanics in a kinase - dependent manner . 202 Knockdown of ATG13 , FIP200 / RB1CC1 , ATG7 , or ATG14 had no appreciable effects on cell 203 spreading and actin structure , whereas knockdown of ULK1 resulted in over - spreading and actin 204 super - assembly ( Fig . S2B - D ) , implying that ULK1 participate in mechanotransduction pathways 205 independent of autophagy . We found similar effects of ULK2 ( i . e . , ULK2 - / - cells with re - expression of 206 ULK2 WT and KD ) in regulating cell size and actin structure ( Fig . 2F - 2G , and S2E ) . Live cell imaging 207 revealed that ULK1 - expressing cells showed delays in cell spreading on glass ( Fig . S2F - 2G ) . This 208 phenomenon was independently validated by silencing ULK1 and ULK2 using shRNAs ( Fig . S2H ) . 209 For cells growing on glass , the decreased actomyosin contraction due to ULK1 expression was 210 accompanied by lower cellular stiffness measured by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) ( Fig . 2H ) . 211 8 Together , our data implicate an intriguing role of ULK1 / 2 in negatively regulating actin assembly , 212 leading to reductions in cell stiffness , contractile forces and adaptability to mechanical inputs . 213 FAs are dynamic transmembrane macromolecular assemblies serving as a major node to 214 translate mechanical stimuli to biological signal and dictate downstream cellular behavior , including 215 cell migration , differentiation , and division ( Parsons et al . , 2010 ) . Based on our findings that ULK1 / 2 216 negatively regulate cell mechanotransduction , we next tested the hypothesis that ULK1 / 2 influence 217 the dynamics of FAs . Consistent with this hypothesis , stiffer substrates significantly increased the 218 formation of FAs , which was markedly attenuated by expression of ULK1 WT but not ULK1 KD ( Fig . 219 2I - 2J ) . We next treated cells expressing different ULK variants grown on glass with the myosin 220 inhibitor blebbistatin and allowed the cells to recover while we monitored the assembly / maturation of 221 FAs . We found that ULK1 significantly hindered FA assembly / maturation ( Fig . 2K - 2L ) . In contrast , 222 knockdown of ATG13 , FIP200 / RB1CC1 , ATG7 , or ATG14 resulted in relatively modest changes in 223 FA morphology as compared to ULK1 knockdown ( Fig . S2I - S2K ) . Based on these results , we 224 propose that ULK1 / 2 suppress stiffness - dependent cell spreading , actin reinforcement , and FA 225 assembly via autophagy - independent mechanisms . 226 ULK1 / 2 interact with and phosphorylate PXN directly both in vitro and in cells 227 To pursue the molecular mechanism by which ULK1 / 2 has these effects , we first examined PXN , a 228 well - studied adaptor protein within FAs that has been shown to genetically interact with ULK1 / 2 in 229 Drosophila ( Chen et al . , 2008 ) . PXN is a highly conserved protein that harbors 5 LD domains in its N 230 terminus and 4 LIM domains in its C terminus . Both the N and C termini mediate protein - protein 231 interactions that are implicated in FA dynamics and mechanotransduction ( Deakin and Turner , 2008 ) . 232 We began by testing interactions between ULK1 / 2 and PXN by immunoprecipitation in 233 HEK293T cells . We found that exogenously expressed PXN co - immunoprecipitated with ULK1 / 2 234 ( Fig . 3A ) . Recombinant PXN also pulled down with ULK1 / 2 immunopurified from HEK293T cells , 235 suggesting direct interactions ( Fig . 3B ) . We next generated a series of tagged ULK1 and PXN 236 truncation mutants and expressed these proteins in HEK293T cells ( Fig . 3C ) . We found that ULK1 / 2 237 co - immunoprecipitated with the LIM4 domain located within the C terminus of PXN ( Fig . 3D - 3E , and 238 Fig . S3A ) , and that full - length PXN co - immunoprecipitated with the C terminus of ULK1 ( Fig . 3F ) . 239 These results prompted us to examine whether ULK1 / 2 were also present in FAs along with PXN . 240 Indeed , both ULK1 and ULK2 colocalized with PXN in the FAs in HeLa cells ( Fig . 3G - 3H ) . 241 We also examined interactions between ULK1 / 2 and HIC5 , a close paralogue of PXN 242 sharing extensive sequence and structural similarities ( Alpha et al . , 2020 ; Deakin and Turner , 2008 ) . 243 9 Both redundant and non - redundant functions have been reported for PXN and HIC5 ( Alpha et al . , 244 2020 ; Deakin and Turner , 2008 ) . Not surprisingly , HIC5 also interacted with ULK1 and ULK2 in a 245 fashion akin to PXN ( Fig . S3B - S3C ) , and C - terminal regions of HIC5 and ULK1 were responsible for 246 these interactions ( Fig . S3D - S3E ) . Given the homology and functional redundancy between PXN 247 and HIC5 , we focused our subsequent studies on PXN . 248 Proteins interacting with ULK1 / 2 are often direct substrates of these kinases ( Wang and 249 Kundu , 2017 ) . We took advantage of a previously described p ( S / T ) Phe antibody that recognizes 250 phosphorylated serine / threonine residues with tyrosine , tryptophan , or phenylalanine at the −1 251 position or phenylalanine at the + 1 position . When phosphorylated , the target serine / threonine sites 252 of many substrates of ULK1 / 2 can be detected by this antibody ( Joo et al . , 2016 ; Russell et al . , 253 2013 ) . We transiently co - expressed PXN with ULK1 , ULK2 , and their KD mutants in HEK293T cells 254 and found that PXN was phosphorylated by both ULK1 and ULK2 in a kinase - dependent manner 255 ( Fig . 3I ) . Human PXN harbors 8 serine / threonine sites that when phosphorylated , can be detected 256 by the p ( S / T ) Phe antibody . To determine which of these sites were targets of ULK1 / 2 257 phosphorylation , we performed site - directed mutagenesis to substitute each of these residues with 258 alanines ( S32A , S89 / 90 / 91A , S119A , S164A , S382A , T475A , S481A , T540A ) . We found that that 259 alanine substitutions at S32 and S119 dramatically diminished ULK1 - mediated phosphorylation of 260 PXN in HEK293T cells ( Fig . S3F ) . As expected , a 2SA ( S32A , S119A ) PXN mutation was sufficient 261 to abolish the phosphorylation ( Fig . 3J ) . We next performed in vitro kinase assays , finding that 262 ULK1 / 2 - mediated phosphorylation of PXN at S32 and S119 was direct ( Fig . 3K - 3L ) . We attempted to 263 generate antibodies raised against phospho - peptides containing S32 and S119 , respectively , but did 264 not succeed ( data not shown ) . Therefore , we continued to utilize the p ( S / T ) Phe antibody to 265 characterize PXN phosphorylation by ULK1 / 2 . Mechanical stimulation with increasing substrate 266 stiffness elicited striking upregulation of PXN phosphorylation ( Fig . 3M ) , which was attenuated by a 267 selective ULK inhibitor , SBI - 0206965 ( Fig . 3N - 3O ) . Furthermore , the PXN 2SA mutant was refractory 268 to mechanical stimuli - induced phosphorylation ( Fig . 3M - 3O ) . When cells growing on still glass were 269 treated with myosin inhibitor blebbistatin , PXN phosphorylation was dramatically reduced ( S3G - 270 S3H ) . Conversely , when cells growing on relatively soft substrate ( 60 kPa ) were stimulated with 271 RhoA activator ( Rho activator II ) , PXN phosphorylation was markedly enhanced . Collectively , our 272 data demonstrate that ULK1 / 2 directly phosphorylate PXN at S32 and S119 in vitro and likely in 273 cellular mechanotransduction as well . 274 ULK1 / 2 - mediated phosphorylation of PXN gate - keeps cellular mechanotransduction 275 To determine the functional impact of ULK - mediated phosphorylation of PXN , we stably expressed 276 EV ( empty vector ) , PXN WT , the phospho - defective 2SA , or a phospho - mimetic 2SD and assessed 277 10 their ability to restore the aberrant migration and mechanotransduction of PXN null cells . In MDA - 278 MB - 231 cells , PXN WT efficiently rescued the compromised migration of PXN - / - cells , whereas 279 expression of PXN 2SD failed to do so ( Fig . 4A - 4B ) . Such inhibitory effects of PXN phosphorylation 280 on cell migration were similarly observed in HeLa cells ( Fig . S4A - S4B ) . More importantly , the PXN 281 2SD mutant was capable of restraining cell migration even in cells depleted of ULK1 by shRNA ( Fig . 282 S4C - S4D ) , suggesting that PXN functions downstream of ULK1 in this pathway . 283 We next asked if PXN phosphorylation by ULK1 / 2 affect breast cancer cell metastasis in 284 vivo . We injected PXN - reconstituted PXN - / - MDA - MB - 231 cells , which also stably expressed 285 luciferase , into nude mice through their tail vein . Bioluminescence imaging using luciferase showed 286 that compared to WT PXN , cells harboring the PXN 2SA mutant metastasized much more 287 extensively to the lung , whereas the 2SD mutant decreased lung metastases ( Fig . 4C - 4D ) . These 288 results suggest that ULK1 / 2 - dependent phosphorylation of PXN restrains breast cancer metastasis . 289 To test the consequences of PXN phosphorylation in mechanotransduction , we used PXN - / - 290 HeLa cells , which exhibited severely compromised ability to spread , rearrange their F - actin 291 cytoskeletal network , and assemble FAs on substrates of high stiffness . WT PXN potently rescued 292 these defects of PXN - / - cells . In contrast , expression of 2SA PXN caused the cells to over - spread , 293 arrange a more elaborate actin network , and assemble more FAs , ( Fig . 4E - 4H and S4E - 4F ) . Next , 294 we sought to investigate if PXN phosphorylation alters actin assembly dynamics . We used 295 cytochalasin D to disrupt intracellular actin polymerization and then removed the inhibitor to permit 296 actin growth over time . This experiment showed that F - actin polymerized more quickly in cells 297 expressing the 2SA mutant than those with either WT or 2SD PXN ( Fig . S4G - S4H ) . This observation 298 suggests that ULK1 / 2 limits cell spreading and actin remodeling through phosphorylating PXN in 299 response to mechanical inputs . The activity of Rho GTPases family , including RhoA and Rac1 , is 300 tightly associated with cell mechanotransduction ( Lawson and Burridge , 2014 ; Ohashi et al . , 2017 ) . 301 For instance , RhoA promotes the formation of actin stress fibers and the production of contractile 302 forces and Rac1 facilitates FA maturation ( Lawson and Burridge , 2014 ; Ohashi et al . , 2017 ) . 303 Therefore , we reasoned that PXN phosphorylation alters the overall cellular activity of RhoA and 304 Rac1 . We performed GST pull - down assay with GST - RTNK and GST - PAK1 , which specifically bind 305 to activated RhoA and Rac1 , respectively . Interestingly , PXN - / - cells showed low levels of active 306 RhoA and Rac1 , which were greatly increased by reconstituting WT PXN . Expression of PXN 2SA 307 resulted in much higher degree of RhoA and Rac1 activation ( Fig . S4I - 4J ) , entirely consistent with 308 the enhanced mechanotransduction of these cells . Furthermore , we used AFM to measure the 309 impact of PXN phosphorylation on cellular stiffness . Depleting PXN substantially softened the cells , 310 which were markedly reversed by reintroducing WT PXN ( Fig . 4I ) . Cells expressing phospho - 311 11 defective 2SA PXN were much stiffer compared to those expression WT or 2SD PXN ( Fig . 4I ) and 312 exerted significantly augmented contractile forces towards the matrix , as evidenced by both 3D 313 collagen contraction assay ( Fig . 4J - 4K ) and TFM ( Fig . 4L - 4M ) . Taken together , these results suggest 314 that phosphorylation of PXN by ULK1 / 2 suppresses cell mechanics , dysfunction of which facilitates 315 breast cancer metastasis . 316 Phosphorylation of PXN by ULK1 / 2 alters its biophysical properties 317 FAs are the major cellular structure responsible for mechanosensing and mechanotransduction . The 318 intracellular portion of FAs consists of hundreds of proteins and exhibits liquid - like properties ( Horton 319 et al . , 2015 ; Kuo et al . , 2011 ) . Intriguingly , several recent investigations have reported a role for 320 liquid - liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) in governing FA dynamics ( Case et al . , 2022 ; Li et al . , 2020 ; 321 Wang et al . , 2021 ; Zhu et al . , 2020 ) . Consistent with these reports , our unpublished data suggest 322 that PXN undergoes LLPS to promote the macromolecular assembly of the cytosolic FA complex 323 ( Wang et al . , 2022 ) . Given these findings , we hypothesized that ULK1 / 2 - mediated phosphorylation of 324 PXN might influence PXN LLPS , and therefore FA dynamics , cancer cell mechanics , and metastasis . 325 To test this hypothesis , we first purified recombinant PXN WT , 2SA , and 2SD from E . coli ( Fig . S5A ) 326 and assessed the behavior of these proteins in vitro . PXN WT began forming micro - sized droplets at 327 a concentration of 6 . 25 µM in physiologically relevant buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 0 ) without any 328 molecular crowder ( Fig . 5A ) . The threshold concentration required for LLPS was slightly higher for 329 PXN 2SA ( ~ 10 µM ) and dramatically higher for PXN 2SD ( > 25 µM ) ( Fig . 5A - 5B ) , suggesting an 330 inhibitory effect of PXN phosphorylation on PXN LLPS . 331 We next sought to determine whether a similar phenomenon occurs in cells by using an 332 optogenetic tool wherein intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) of target proteins are fused with Cry2 333 ( Shin et al . , 2017 ) . In this system , Cry2 oligomerizes upon blue light illumination , serving as the initial 334 nucleation event to trigger intracellular LLPS ( Shin et al . , 2017 ) . Because the N terminus of PXN was 335 predicted to be largely disordered ( data not shown ) , we expressed this fragment fused with Cry2 - 336 mCherry ( PXN - Cry2 ) as well as mCherry - Cry2 alone ( Control - Cry2 ) ( Fig . 5C ) . Whereas PXN - / - HeLa 337 cells stably expressing Control - Cry2 remain unresponsive to brief blue light exposure ( 2 mins ) , more 338 than 90 % of cells expressing PXN - Cry2 WT rapidly formed numerous cytoplasmic condensates 339 upon blue light exposure ( Fig . 5D - 5E ) . Similar results were obtained with cells expressing PXN - Cry2 340 2SA ( Fig . 5D - 5E ) . Strikingly , cells expressing PXN - Cry2 2SD were almost refractory to blue light 341 stimulation ( Fig . 5D - 5E ) , indicating diminished light - induced PXN LLPS due to PXN phosphorylation . 342 We next performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) to assess the 343 molecular dynamism of PXN mutants in cells . All the GFP - PXN fusion protein , including WT , 2SA , 344 12 and 2SD , localized to the FAs . When we photobleached the GFP - PXN within the FAs , the recovery 345 rate was significantly faster for PXN 2SA and significantly slower for PXN 2SD , compared to GFP - 346 PXN WT , ( Fig . 5F - 5G ) , indicating weaker physical interactions between the 2SD mutant with the FA 347 constituents . 348 Given that high order homotypic oligomerization often promotes protein LLPS ( Zhang et al . , 349 2020 ) , we sought to determine if PXN forms oligomers and if so , is it affected by phosphorylation ? 350 Using in vitro cross - linking with bis - sulfosuccinimidyl suberate ( BS 3 ) , we found that purified PXN WT 351 was capable of forming dimers . This ability was prominently diminished for the PXN 2SD mutant 352 ( Fig . S5B ) . We further took advantage of dynamic light scattering to evaluate the oligomeric status of 353 recombinant WT and 2SD PXN proteins . PXN monomer was predicted to be 60 . 9 kDa , and the 354 molecular weight of PXN WT in aqueous solution was determined to be 111 . 0 kDa , suggesting that 355 the majority of PXN WT likely exists as dimers under our experimental condition ( Fig . 5H ) . In 356 contrast , the molecular weight of PXN 2SD was decreased to 89 . 0 kDa , suggesting a decreased 357 proportion of PXN 2SD dimers in the solution ( Fig . 5H ) . Consistent with this observation , we found 358 that PXN 2SD was less likely to initiate self - interaction in cells as shown by immunoprecipitation 359 ( Fig . S5C ) . Taken together , we propose that phosphorylation of PXN by ULK1 / 2 weakens homotypic 360 interactions , decelerates molecular thermodynamics , and therefore increases the threshold for 361 LLPS , which subsequently leads to impeded FA assembly / maturation . 362 ULK1 / 2 and FAK act antagonistically to regulate cell mechanotransduction 363 Notably , the serine phosphorylation sites of PXN mediated by ULK1 / 2 ( S32 and S119 ) are 364 adjacent to the tyrosine phosphorylation sites mediated by FAK / Src ( Y31 and Y118 ) ( Brown and 365 Turner , 2004 ) . All of these residues are evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates ( Fig . S6A ) , 366 suggesting their functional importance . Given the opposing trends of ULK1 / 2 and FAK / Src 367 expression in breast cancer tissues ( Fig . 1A , and Fig . S1A ) , we hypothesized that these two sets of 368 kinases might have an antagonistic regulatory relationship in mechanotransduction . To test this 369 hypothesis , we generated PXN mutants with altered FAK / Src phosphorylation sites , either alone or 370 in combination with mutated ULK1 / 2 phosphorylation sites . Thus , we generated forms of PXN that 371 were phospho - defective ( PXN 2YF ) , phospho - mimetic ( PXN 2YE ) , quadruple phospho - defective 372 ( PXN 2YF / 2SA ) , or quadruple phospho - mimetic ( PXN 2YE / 2SD ) , and then reconstituted PXN - / - cells 373 with these proteins ( Fig . S6B ) . As expected , PXN WT rescued the aberrant cell spreading , disrupted 374 actin stress fibers , and defective FA assembly / maturation of the PXN - / - cells . Whereas expression of 375 PXN 2YF yielded phenotypes indistinguishable from those associated with PXN WT , expression of 376 PXN 2YE resulted in even greater cell spreading , longer F - actin length , and greater FA assembly 377 than did expression of PXN WT ( Fig . 6A - 6D ) , suggesting a positive role for FAK / Src - mediated 378 13 phosphorylation of PXN in cell mechanotransduction . Importantly , the impact of PXN phosphorylation 379 at Y31 and Y118 on cellular morphology and FA assembly / maturation was reversed by PXN 380 phosphorylation at S32 and S119 ( Fig . 6A - 6D ) . Compared to WT PXN , PXN 2YF expression 381 resulted in a small but consist decrease in cell contraction in the 3D collagen contraction assay . This 382 compromised cell contractility due to defective FAK phosphorylation was dramatically rescued by the 383 quadruple phospho - defective ( 2YF / 2SA ) PXN mutant ( Fig . 6E - 6F ) , indicating functional antagonism 384 of serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of PXN in cell contraction . 385 We next performed biochemical studies to investigate the apparent antagonism between 386 ULK1 / 2 and FAK / Src . In in vitro kinase assays , pre - incubation of PXN with ULK1 / 2 WT , but not 387 ULK1 / 2 KD , dramatically inhibited PXN phosphorylation by FAK in vitro ( Fig . 6G ) , consistent with our 388 observation that PXN 2SD showed lower levels of phosphorylation by FAK and Src compared with 389 PXN WT ( Fig . 6H , S6C ) . Conversely , pre - incubation of PXN with FAK markedly reduced PXN 390 phosphorylation by ULK1 / 2 ( Fig . 6I ) , and the PXN 2YE mutant showed decreased levels of 391 phosphorylation by ULK1 / 2 ( Fig . 6J ) . These data demonstrate that ULK1 / 2 and FAK / Src 392 competitively phosphorylate PXN . 393 We further noted that while the PXN 2SD mutant showed decreased interaction with FAK 394 and Src ( Fig . 6K - 6L ) , PXN 2YE exhibited enhanced binding to FAK and Src ( Fig . 6M - 6N , and S6D - 395 S6G ) . This altered binding affinity of PXN 2YE was specific for FAK , as we detected no changes in 396 binding to other interacting partners , such as Vinculin and Kindlin - 2 , in the PXN phospho - mutants 397 compared with PXN WT ( Fig . S6H - S6K ) . We next examined the binding partners of PXN 2SA and 398 2SA by co - immunoprecipitation in cells . We found that PXN 2SA displayed stronger association with 399 several binding partners , including HIC - 5 , FAK , Src , GIT - 1 , and kindlin - 2 , whereas PXN 2SD showed 400 little interaction with these proteins ( Fig . 6O ) . Therefore , we propose that PXN phosphorylation by 401 ULK1 / 2 disfavors heterotypic interactions between FAK / Src and PXN , and subsequently inhibits 402 PXN tyrosine phosphorylation . This PXN - centric signaling node functions as a dynamic modulator of 403 mechanotransduction , which is linked to the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells . 404 405 Discussion 406 Here , we demonstrate that independent of autophagy regulation , ULK1 / 2 negatively govern breast 407 cancer cell mechanotransduction and migration through phosphorylating PXN . Phosphorylation of 408 PXN by ULK1 / 2 weakens homotypic interactions , decelerates molecular thermodynamics , and 409 14 therefore increases the threshold for LLPS , which subsequently leads to impeded FA 410 assembly / maturation and aberrant mechanotransduction . 411 Our demonstration of ULK1 / 2 in autophagy - independent mechanotransduction adds to their 412 expanding non - canonical functional spectrum ( Joo et al . , 2016 ; Wang et al . , 2018 ; Wang and Kundu , 413 2017 ; Wang et al . , 2019 ) . Although ULK1 / 2 - mediated phosphorylation of PXN in 414 mechanotransduction appears to be unrelated to autophagy under nutrient - rich culture conditions , it 415 does not exclude the possibility that ULK1 / 2 may regulate autophagy flux through PXN 416 phosphorylation . Indeed , PXN has been implicated in autophagy regulation in several independent 417 studies ( Chen et al . , 2008 ; Lv et al . , 2022 ; Sharifi et al . , 2016 ) . ULK1 / 2 may redirect cellular 418 resources to autophagy - related pathways in response to metabolic stress ( Wang and Kundu , 2017 ) 419 and we therefore speculate that such a rewiring mechanism may also apply for the ULK1 / 2 - PXN 420 complex . For example , ULK1 / 2 might relay mechanical signals to downstream machinery by 421 phosphorylating PXN in response to mechanical stimuli where both AMPK and mTOR are activated , 422 but redirect PXN ( and perhaps other FA components ) for stress - induced autophagy under starvation 423 conditions , when AMPK is activated and mTOR is inhibited . Thus , our study establishes a ULK1 / 2 - 424 PXN signaling nexus in mechanotransduction in breast tumors , which may function as a molecular 425 switch between mechanotransduction and autophagy regulation . 426 The macromolecular assembly of FAs in the cytoplasm is facilitated by LLPS . Several lines 427 of evidence suggest that the phase separation properties of FA - associated proteins , and therefore 428 FA dynamics , are modulated by ECM mechanical stimuli ( Case et al . , 2022 ; Li et al . , 2020 ; Wang et 429 al . , 2021 ; Zhu et al . , 2020 ) . For example , LIMD1 , which is structurally similar to PXN , was recently 430 shown to undergo LLPS and mechanical force - dependent localization to mature FAs ( Wang et al . , 431 2021 ) . Yet , how the dynamics of FAs are regulated in response to mechanostimulation , and the role 432 of LLPS in this process , are much less clear . To our knowledge , the present study represents the first 433 demonstration of a causal relationship between posttranslational modification and LLPS , FA 434 dynamics , mechanotransduction , and tumor metastasis . Significant efforts are being devoted to 435 targeting the biophysical properties of biomolecular condensates for treating disease . Hence , 436 modulating the material properties of FAs , which are membrane - associated condensates , could 437 provide a new perspective for breast cancer therapy . 438 Our studies also demonstrate that ULK1 / 2 and FAK / Src act oppositely in 439 mechanotransduction by competitive phosphorylation . Phosphorylation of PXN by one kinase 440 ( ULK1 / 2 or FAK / Src ) substantially attenuated the phosphorylation of PXN by the other ( FAK / Src or 441 ULK1 / 2 ) both in vitro and in cells , and we found that phosphorylation by these kinases acted 442 antagonistically in mechanotransduction . Such a precise regulatory mechanism likely entails an 443 15 upstream kinase to coordinate the activity of ULK1 / 2 and FAK / Src such that cells properly respond to 444 mechanical stimulation . The identity of such kinase ( s ) remains unknown . Importantly , FAK / Src - 445 mediated phosphorylation at Y31 and Y113 , and ULK1 / 2 - mediated phosphorylation at the 446 neighboring S32 and S119 , are evolutionarily conserved in the vertebrates , highlighting the 447 importance of this signaling nexus . Such an elegant regulatory mechanism by serine and tyrosine 448 kinases reflects the intricate cellular programs to gate - keep mechanosensing and 449 mechanotransduction . 450 Dysfunctional mechanosensing and mechanotransduction contribute to tumorigenesis and 451 metastasis ( Broders - Bondon et al . , 2018 ; Riehl et al . , 2020 ) . Non - tumorous cells are sensitive to 452 mechanical cues from the ECM . In contrast , tumorous cells often are refractory to these cues and 453 gain uncontrolled growth and migration . Here , we reveal that breast cancer cells hijack the 454 suppressive forces of mechanotransduction mediated by the ULK1 / 2 - PXN complex and boost the 455 mechanotransduction - promoting mechanisms fulfilled by the FAK / Src - PXN complex to accelerate 456 tumor metastasis . We propose that the ULK1 / 2 - PXN - FAK / Src signaling node in the 457 mechanotransduction pathway can be targeted to treat breast tumors . In fact , FAK inhibitors hold 458 great promise for breast cancer treatment ( Lorusso et al . , 2022 ; Timbrell et al . , 2021 ) . As ULK1 / 2 459 agonists are now commercially available , augmenting ULK1 / 2 kinase activity may represent a new 460 therapeutic avenue . 461 462 16 Materials and methods 463 Clinical tissue analysis 464 Clinical study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to 465 Xiamen University in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki .

The proteins were eluted 583 with elution buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 500 mM NaCl , 300 mM imidazole ) . Eluate was concentrated 584 and cleaved with TEV protease at 4°C . The cleaved tags and TEV protease were separated from the 585 protein samples by a second round of Ni - NTA affinity chromatography followed by a Sephadex 200 586 size - exclusion column in 20 mM Hepes , 100 mM NaCl , pH 8 . 0 . The collected fractions were then 587 verified with SDS – PAGE . Purified fractions were pooled , concentrated , and flash - frozen in liquid 588 nitrogen . FAK purification has been described previously ( Wang et al . , 2022 ) . 589 20 Gel contraction assay 590 6 ×10 5 cells were resuspended in 750 µL medium and added to 200 µL rat tail tendon collagen type I 591 ( Shengyou ; 200110 - 50 ) , followed by intensive mixing . The cells and collagen mixture were then 592 seeded into a 6 - well plate and cultured at 37°C with 5 % CO 2 for 30 min . The collagen gels were 593 isolated from the well by shaking gently and then 2 mL medium was added into each well . Photographs 594 of the collagen gels were taken at 0 , 16 , 32 and 48 h . Fiji was used to measure the area of collagen 595 gels at each time point . 596 Atomic force microscopy 597 AFM experiments were carried out in a Bruker Nanowizard 4 ( JPK ) mounted onto an inverted optical 598 microscope ( Zeiss Observer 7 ； Zeiss , Germany ) . Force indentation measurements were carried out 599 using in - house - prepared AFM colloidal probes ( a spherical silica bead with a diameter of 10 μ m glued 600 on the cantilever by epoxy ) . Before each experiment , we performed a calibration to determine the 601 elastic coefficient of the cantilever . During the experiment , cells were kept at 37°C in 1 x PBS buffer . 602 Indentations were performed at a loading force of 0 . 5 nN and a constant speed of 4 μ m / s . Young ' s 603 modulus was obtained by fitting the force - distance curve to the Hertzian sphere model . 604 Preparation of PA gels 605 Preparation of PA gels with different stiffness was done as previously described ( Denisin and Pruitt , 606 2016 ) . The acrylamide mix was dropped on the glass slides . PA gels were removed from the slide 607 glass after solidification . The stiffness of PA gels was measured by AFM . 608 We functionalized the PA gels with fibronectin according to the following procedure : ( 1 ) PA 609 gels were treated with soaking buffer ( 137 mM NaCl , 5 % glycerol ) for 1 hour ; ( 2 ) After removing the 610 soaking buffer , the PA gels were further treated with buffer mix containing EDC / NHS and 611 conjugation buffer ( 0 . 2 M MES , 10 % glycerol , pH 4 . 5 ) in the dark ; ( 3 ) The gels were coated with 612 fibronectin at a final concentration of 50 µg / mL at 4°C overnight . 613 Traction force microscopy 614 We manufactured a glass slide with a chamber , and spread PA gel ( 8 kPa ) embedded with 580 / 605 615 100 nm - diameter on the bottom of the chamber . The cells were allowed to adhere to the substrate for 616 at least 12 h prior to imaging . Fluorescence images of the embedded beads were captured on LSM 617 980 ( Zeiss ) confocal imaging system . After collecting the images of the beads , 0 . 25 % trypsin / EDTA 618 was added to detach the cells for at least 5 min , and images of the bead position without cellular 619 21 forces were captured . Displacement of the beads and reconstruction of force field were calculated 620 based on Matlab algorithm ( https : / / github . com / DanuserLab / TFM ) The corresponding gel deformations 621 were obtained by 2D Gaussian distribution interpolation . Using an algorithm based on Fourier 622 transform , the stress field of the gel deformation was calculated . 623 Transwell assay 624 3 × 10 4 cells were seeded into the upper chamber of the transwell plates ( Corning Incorporated ; 3422 ) 625 in FBS - free medium . Medium containing 10 % FBS were added to the lower compartment as 626 chemoattractant . After incubation at 37°C for 16 - 18 h , the migrated cells were fixed by 4 % PFA 627 ( Leagene ; DF0135 ) for 10 min and stained with 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) crystal violet ( Sangon Biotech ; A600331 - 628 0100 ) for 10 min and washed with ddH 2 O . The stained cells were imaged by Olympus IX51 4 x 629 objective , and Fiji was used to count the cell number . All migration assays were repeated at least 3 630 times . 631 Fluorescence recovery after photo - bleaching 632 FRAP experiments were performed using water lens on a Cell Discoverer 7 ( Zeiss ) system . Cells 633 were maintained at 37°C and 5 % CO2 . Cells were imaged for a total of 100 s at a maximum rate of 1 634 frame per s . After 3 pre - bleach frames , the fluorescence signal from a region of interest ( 2 μm × 2 635 μm ) was bleached with a 488 nm laser at 100 % power . The s ignal from the bleached ROI was 636 measured for 90 s afterwards . We used ZEN to derive the raw fluorescence values . EasyFRAP 637 software ( https : / / easyfrap . vmnet . upatras . gr / ) was used for rectify and normalize the data . 638 Protein labelling 639 The Fluro 488 NHS ester ( AAT Bioquest ; 1810 ) or Cy3 NHS ester ( AAT Bioquest ; 271 ) were 640 dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mg / mL . The labelling dye was incubated with the target 641 protein 1 : 1 ( molar ratio ) at RT for 1 hour with continuous stirring . Free dye was removed using a 642 desalting column ( Merck Millipore ; UFC501024 ) , the labeled proteins was aliquoted and flash - frozen 643 in liquid nitrogen . 644 In vitro LLPS assay 645 Mixtures in a total solution volume of 2 μL were placed in on slides with double - sided tape . Cover 646 glasses were placed on top to seal the slides . Droplet formation of purified protein was monitored by 647 fluorescence microscopy using a confocal microscope ( Zeiss LSM 900 ) . 648 22 Size - exclusion chromatography coupled with multi - angle light scattering ( SEC - MALS ) 649 SEC - MALS experiments were carried out on DAWN HELEOS - II ( Wyatt Technology Corporation ) 650 coupled with a Shimadzu liquid chromatography system equipped with a Superdex 200 10 / 300 GL 651 ( GE Healthcare ) gel - filtration column . Protein samples for this experiment were dialyzed to a buffer 652 containing 20 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 400 mM NaCl , 2 mM DTT , and 0 . 03 % NaN 3 . 200 μL proteins at a 653 concentration of 0 . 02 - 0 . 05 mM were injected and run at a flow rate of 0 . 03 mL / min . The ASTRA 654 version 6 . 0 . 5 ( Wyatt Technology Corporation ) was used for data collection and analyses . 655 Quantification and statistical analyses 656 Measurements of adhesion area were done with the Imaris software ( Bitplane ) using the surface 657 reconstruction tool . 658 To quantify protein colocalization , the cloco2 plug - in ( Analyze - Colocalization - Coloc 2 ) of the 659 image j software was used to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the two target 660 channels per the instructions . 661 Actin filament were analyzed by applying a steerable filter approach with a deposited software 662 FSegment ( http : / / www2 . medizin . uni - greifswald . de / anatomie / forschung / niere / fsegment / ) . We counted 663 the total length of microfilaments in each image , and then calculated the average length of each cell . 664 All analyses were performed blindly . All quantitative data are shown as mean ± SEM or median 665 ± 95 % confidence interval from n ≥ 3 biological replicates unless otherwise specified . Statistical 666 significance was determined by Student’s t - test or ANOVA as appropriate , and * p < 0 . 05 was 667 considered statistically significant . Statistical parameters are also reported in the figures and legends . 668 669 Declaration of interests 670 The authors declare no competing interests 671 672 Acknowledgements 673 We are grateful to Dr .
