Rapid changes in tissue mechanics regulate cell behaviour in the developing embryonic brain Amelia J Thompson † , Eva K Pillai † , Ivan B Dimov , Sarah K Foster , Christine E Holt , Kristian Franze * Department of Physiology , Development and Neuroscience , University of Cambridge , Cambridge , United Kingdom Abstract Tissue mechanics is important for development ; however , the spatio - temporal dynamics of in vivo tissue stiffness is still poorly understood . We here developed tiv - AFM , combining time - lapse in vivo atomic force microscopy with upright fluorescence imaging of embryonic tissue , to show that during development local tissue stiffness changes significantly within tens of minutes . Within this time frame , a stiffness gradient arose in the developing Xenopus brain , and retinal ganglion cell axons turned to follow this gradient . Changes in local tissue stiffness were largely governed by cell proliferation , as perturbation of mitosis diminished both the stiffness gradient and the caudal turn of axons found in control brains . Hence , we identified a close relationship between the dynamics of tissue mechanics and developmental processes , underpinning the importance of time - resolved stiffness measurements .

Recent measurements at specific time points suggested that tissue mechanics change during developmental ( Koser et al . , 2016 ; Iwashita et al . , 2014 ; Majkut et al . , 2013 ) and pathological ( Murphy et al . , 2011 ; Moeendarbary et al . , 2017 ) processes , which might significantly impact cell function . Furthermore , several approaches have recently been developed to measure in vivo tissue stiffness , including atomic force microscopy ( Barriga et al . , 2018 ; Koser et al . , 2016 ; Gautier et al . , 2015 ) , magnetic resonance elastography ( Sack et al . , 2008 ) , Brillouin microscopy ( Scarcelli and Yun , 2012 ) , and magnetically responsive ferrofluid microdroplets ( Serwane et al . , 2017 ) . However , the precise spa - tiotemporal dynamics of tissue mechanics remains poorly understood , and how cells respond to changes in local tissue stiffness in vivo is largely unknown . To enable time - resolved measurements of developmental tissue mechanics , we here developed time - lapse in vivo atomic force microscopy ( tiv - AFM ) , a method that combines sensitive upright epi - fluorescence imaging of opaque samples , such as frog embryos , with iterated AFM indentation measurements of in vivo tissue at cellular resolution and at a time scale of tens of minutes ( Figure 1 ) . A fluorescence zoom stereomicroscope equipped with an sCMOS camera ( quantum yield 82 % ) was custom - fitted above a bio - AFM set - up ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , which had a transparent pathway along the area of the cantilever . To cope with the long working distance required for imag - ing through the AFM head , the microscope was fitted with a 0 . 125 NA / 114 mm WD objective . The AFM was set up on an automated motorised stage containing a temperature - controlled sample holder to maintain live specimens at optimal conditions during the experimental time course .

In the OT , retinal ganglion cell ( RGC ) axons grow in a bundle across the brain surface , making a stereotypical turn in the caudal direction en route that directs them to their target , the optic tectum ( McFarlane and Lom , 2012 ) . We previously demonstrated that by later stages of OT outgrowth ( i . e . when axons had reached their target ) , a local stiffness gra - dient lies orthogonal to the path of OT axons , with the stiffer region rostral to the OT and softer region caudal to it ( Koser et al . , 2016 ) . This gradient strongly correlated with axon turning , with the OT routinely turning caudally towards softer tissue ( Koser et al . , 2016 ) . We therefore wanted to determine when this stiffness gradient first developed , whether its emergence preceded OT axon turning , and what the origin of the stiffness gradient was . To answer these questions , we performed iterated tiv - AFM measurements of the embryonic brain in vivo at early - intermediate stages , that is , just before and during turn initiation by the first ‘pioneer’ OT axons . The apparent elastic modulus K , which is a measure of the tissue’s elastic stiffness , was assessed in an ~ 150 by 250 m m raster at 20 m m resolution every ~ 35 min , producing a sequence of ‘stiffness maps’ of the area ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . The applied force ( F = 10 nN ) and can - tilever probe ( r = 18 . 64 m m ) were chosen to measure the stiffness mainly of the top ~ 20 – 30 m m of the tissue , within which RGC axons grow ( Holt , 1989 ; Harris et al . , 1987 ) . To reduce noise , raw AFM data were interpolated and smoothed in x - , y - , and time dimensions using an algorithm based on the discrete cosine transform ( Figure 2a , b , see Materials and methods for details ) ( Garcia , 2010 ; Garcia , 2011 ) . Simultaneously , we recorded optical time - lapse images of fluorescently labelled RGC axons growing through the region of interest ( Figure 2a , Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . To assess whether repeated AFM measurements of the Xenopus brain affect RGC axon growth , we first conducted time - lapse AFM measurements on one group of embryos while we exposed another group to the same conditions without making force measurements . At the end of the experiments ( i . e . , at stage 37 / 38 ) , OTs were labelled with DiI ( Wizenmann et al . , 2009 ) , and their elongation and turning angles measured . We did not find any significant differences between the groups ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) , suggesting that repeated AFM measurements do not affect axon growth . eLife digest Neurons in the brain form an intricate network that follows a precise template . For example , in a young frog embryo , the neurons from the eyes send out thin structures , called axons , which navigate along a well - defined path and eventually connect with the visual centres of the brain . This journey requires the axons to take a sharp turn so they can wire with the right brain structures . Axons find their paths not only by following chemical signals but also by reacting to the stiffness of their environment . In an older frog embryo for instance , the brain is stiffer at the front , and softer at the back . As neurons from the eyes make their way through the brain , they turn to follow this gradient , moving away from stiffer areas towards the softer regions . Here , Thompson , Pillai et al . investigate when and how this stiffness gradient is established in frogs . To do so , a new technique was developed . Called time - lapse in vivo atomic force microscopy , the method measures how brain stiffness changes over time in a live embryo , while also taking images of the growing axons . The experiments show that the stiffness gradient arose within tens of minutes , just as the first ‘pioneering’ axons from the eyes began to grow across the brain . These axons then responded to the gradient , turning towards the softer tissue . Changes in the number of cells in the underlying brain tissue governed the formation of the gradient , with rapidly stiffening areas containing more cells than those that remained soft . In fact , using drugs that stop cells from dividing reduced both the mechanical gradient and the turning response of the axons . The technique developed by Thompson , Pillai et al . is a useful tool that can help elucidate how variations in stiffness control the brain wiring process . It could also be used to look into how other developmental or regenerative processes , such as the way neurons reconnect after injuries to the brain or spinal cord , may be regulated by mechanical tissue properties .

Early in the time - lapse sequence ( i . e . prior to axon turning ) , the stiffness of the brain was similar on both sides of the OT . However , over the time course of the measurements a stiffness gradient arose , mostly due to rising stiffness of tissue rostral to the OT ( Figure 2a , b ) . Visual inspection of the fold - change in tissue stiff - ness from one time point to the next indicated that significant changes in tissue mechanics were already occurring approximately 40 – 80 min after the onset of measurements ( Figure 2b ) , that is before axons started turning caudally , suggesting that the tissue stiffness gradient was established prior to axon turning . To test this hypothesis , we quantified the temporal evolution of the stiffness gradient in a small region immediately in front of the advancing OT ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1a ) . At the begin - ning of each time point in the sequence of tiv - AFM maps , we calculated the angle through which axons turned ( ‘OT turn angle’ ) . For each animal , minimum and maximum absolute values were rescaled to 0 and 1 , respectively ( Figure 2c ) . The projected appearance of the stiffness gradient pre - ceded the projected onset of axon turning on average by 18 min ( Figure 2d , e ) , indicating that axons indeed turned after the stiffness gradient was established , which is consistent with a role for mechan - ical gradients in helping to guide OT axons caudally ( Koser et al . , 2016 ) . Based on the first time point at which we detected axon turning in each animal , our data suggested that a stiffness gradient of at least ( 0 . 9 ± 0 . 4 ) Pa / m m ( mean ± SEM ) was required for axons to change their growth direction . In line with this idea , RGC axons from heterochronic eye primordia transplants growing through Xen - opus brains at stages before the stiffness gradient is established grow rather straight and do not turn caudally in the mid - diencephalon ( Cornel and Holt , 1992 ) .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 39356 4 of 18 Short report Developmental Biology Physics of Living Systems We have previously shown that tissue stiffness scales with local cell body density ( Barriga et al . , 2018 ; Koser et al . , 2015 ) , and that in Xenopus embryo brains local stiffness gradients at later devel - opmental stages ( 39 - 40 ) correlate with a gradient in cell density ( Koser et al . , 2016 ) . To determine if changes in cell densities are driving changes in tissue stiffness , and thus parallel the evolution of the stiffness gradient at earlier stages , we assayed cell densities using DAPI labelling of nuclei in whole - mounted brains with fluorescently labelled OTs , beginning at the morphological stage corre - sponding to the start of tiv - AFM measurements ( 33 / 34 ) and repeated for the two subsequent stages encompassing OT turning ( 35 / 36 and 37 / 38 ) . While at the first stage cell densities on both sides of the OT were similar , a clear difference in nuclear densities rostral and caudal to the OT developed at later stages ( Figure 3a ) . Cell densities at the two later stages were significantly higher in the region rostral to the OT ( i . e . where tissue was stiffer ) than caudal to it , and the overall magnitude of the cell density gradient significantly rose over time ( Figure 3b ) . Plotting the stage - specific gradient in cell body densities against the stiffness gra - dient revealed a strong linear correlation between them ( Pearson’s correlation coefficient r = 0 . 97 ) ( Figure 3c ) . To test if local cell densities drive the evolution of the stiffness gradient during OT turning , we repeated both nuclear staining and tiv - AFM measurements on embryos treated with the mitotic blocker BI2536 ( Le´na´rt et al . , 2007 ) , which inhibits Polo - like kinase 1 and has previously been used to inhibit in vivo cell proliferation in the embryonic retina ( Weber et al . , 2014 ) . BI2536 also triggered mitotic arrest in brains of developing Xenopus embryos , as the number of phosphorylated histone H3 ( pH3 ) - positive cells ( Hugle et al . , 2015 ) was significantly higher in treated compared to control brains , and the cross - sectional area of treated brains was significantly decreased at later stages , indi - cating a decrease in total cell number ( Figure 4a – c ) . Inspection of the stage - dependent distribution of cells in the developing Xenopus brain suggested that in BI2536 - treated brains , the nuclear density was decreased particularly rostral to the OT ( Figure 4d , Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . In tiv - AFM experiments , blocking cell proliferation significantly attenuated the increase of both the stiff - ness gradient and the OT turn angle over the time course of the experiment ( Figure 4e , f ) , suggest - ing that the gradient in cell densities strongly contributed to the stiffness gradient , which in turn helps instruct axon growth . The absence of an increase in tissue stiffness near the advancing OT in BI2536 - treated brains was furthermore accompanied by a decrease in OT elongation ( Figure 4g ) . Similarly , OT elongation decreased when brains were softened by manipulating the extracellular matrix ( Koser et al . , 2016 ) , confirming that tissue stiffness is involved in regulating axon growth in vivo . We obtained similar results using a different mitotic blocker , hydroxyurea / aphidicolin ( HUA ) , which inhibits DNA replication ( Gilman et al . , 1980 ; Ikegami et al . , 1978 ) and has previously been used to block cell division in Xenopus embryos ( Harris and Hartenstein , 1991 ) . HUA also decreased the gradient in nuclear densities ( mainly by reducing nuclear densities rostral to the OT ) , decreased brain stiffness , and generated defects in OT outgrowth ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . In order to test if the mitotic blocker BI2536 perturbs neuronal mechanosensing , we cultured eye primordia on laminin - coated polyacrylamide substrates of different stiffnesses ( Koser et al . , 2016 ) , exposed the outgrowing RGC axons to the drug , and quantified axon growth as a function of sub - strate stiffness . While RGC axon growth on stiff substrates with a shear modulus G’ ~ 5 , 500 Pa was not altered by the presence of BI2536 if compared to control conditions ( Figure 4—figure supple - ment 3e ) , axons grew longer on soft substrates of G’ ~ 200 Pa when they were exposed to 50 nM BI2536 but not when they were exposed to 500 nM ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3f ) , suggesting that the drug might partially impact axon growth on very soft substrates ( although no significant dif - ferences were observed when axons were grown on slightly stiffer substrates of G’ ~ 300 Pa , Figure 2 continued Figure supplement 1 .

However , similar to control conditions , axons exposed to differ - ent concentrations of BI2536 grew significantly longer on stiff substrates compared to softer sub - strates . Hence , RGC axons responded to substrate stiffness despite the presence of the mitotic blocker ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3g ) . Our data show that , during early embryonic development , local tissue stiffness may change signif - icantly within only tens of minutes ( Figure 2 ) , leading to heterogeneous stiffness distributions which , in the developing Xenopus brain , impact RGC axon growth . These stiffness heterogeneities were largely governed by differential cell proliferation ( Figures 3 and 4 ) , which is in agreement with previ - ously published correlations between cell body densities and tissue stiffness ( Barriga et al . , 2018 ; Koser et al . , 2016 ; Koser et al . , 2015 ; Weber et al . , 2017 ) . Mitotic blockers almost completely abolished the rise of the stiffness gradient ( Figure 4 ) , which was accompanied by a decrease in turn - ing angle of the OT , emphasizing the importance of the control of local cell proliferation for mecha - nosensitive cellular processes in vivo . As changes in substrate stiffness have been shown to promote cell proliferation in vitro ( Georges and Janmey , 2005 ) , an increase in cell density might lead to a mechanical positive feed - back loop , facilitating further cell proliferation . Perturbing cell division , on the other hand , might alter not only local tissue stiffness but also topological cues in the tissue , which may also provide important signals regulating axon growth . Having fewer cell bodies rostral to the OT might decrease the amount of steric hindrance and provide more space for axons to grow into , contributing to the reduction in OT turning angle ( Figure 4e ) . Our analysis of the correlation between local cell body density gradients and stiffness gradients suggests that other structures may contribute to the stiffness gradient as well ( Figure 3c ) , although perhaps to a smaller degree . Potential candidates include radial glial cells ( MacDonald et al . , 2015 ) as well as components of the extracellular matrix ( Moeendarbary et al . , 2017 ) . Tiv - AFM allows simultaneous time - lapse measurements of tissue mechanics in vivo and optical monitoring of fluorescently labelled structures at the surface of otherwise optically opaque samples , at length and time scales that are relevant for developmental processes . It enabled us for the first time to trace the in vivo mechanical properties of the embryonic Xenopus brain as the embryo Figure 4 continued treated embryos compared with controls ( p = 5 . 7e - 05 , Wilcoxon rank - sum test ) , indicating a decrease in total cell number .

As in all other AFM applications , in tiv - AFM forces are applied to sample surfaces , restricting it to biological processes that occur within tens of micrometers away from the surface , such as OT elongation in developing Xenopus embryos . Mapping of the whole Xenopus brain at cellular resolution takes about half an hour , which defines the maximum temporal resolution that can currently be achieved . Future developments of alternative approaches may enable measurements within tissues at even higher rates . However , tiv - AFM in its current form revealed that significant changes in tissue stiffness occur in vivo within tens of minutes , and that these changes have significant implications for a bio - logical process , the outgrowth of RGC axons along the developing embryonic brain . More broadly , tiv - AFM can also be easily adapted for in vivo applications in other small organ - isms , or alternatively in tissues ex vivo . It can be used to study cellular responses to a range of mechanical stimuli via the AFM in vivo , such as sustained compression ( Barriga et al . , 2018 ; Koser et al . , 2016 ) , or to track the temporal mechanical response of tissues or organs to different pharmacological treatments ( such as the mitotic inhibitor used here ) . Additionally , the setup is very versatile and can be further expanded , for example , by combining it with calcium imaging to investi - gate how cellular activity is regulated by changes in tissue stiffness during development and pathol - ogy . Tiv - AFM will greatly expand the range of bio - AFM experiments possible , allowing for more scope both for a detailed characterisation of in vivo tissue mechanics during development and dis - ease progression , and for testing how mechanics shapes cell behaviour and function .

Single - cell - stage , wild - type Xeno - pus laevis embryos of both sexes were obtained via in vitro fertilisation . Embryos were reared in 0 . 1 (cid:2) Modified Barth’s Saline ( MBS ) at 14 – 18 ˚ C to reach the desired developmental stage , as described by Nieuwkoop and Faber , 1958 . All embryos used in this study were below stage 45 . Thompson et al . eLife 2019 ; 8 : e39356 .

To visualise the developing OT during time - lapse AFM experiments , an ath5 : : GAP - eGFP construct ( pCS2 + vector ) ( Poggi et al . , 2005 ; Das et al . , 2003 ) was injected ( 100 pg / 5 nL ) into one dorsal blas - tomere of embryos at the 4 cell stage . The construct consisted of a membrane - tagged GFP fusion under control of the retinal ganglion cell ( RGC ) - specific atonal homolog 5 promoter ( Kanekar et al . , 1997 ) . This selectively labelled RGCs in a single retina , the axons of which grew across the optic chi - asm and into the unlabelled brain hemisphere . Exposed brain preparation Stage 33 / 34 embryos were anaesthetised , the eye primordium was removed and the underlying brain hemisphere exposed as described ( Chien et al . , 1993 ; Irie et al . , 2002 ) . Briefly , embryos were transferred to 1 . 3 (cid:2) MBS solution ( composition : 1 . 3 (cid:2) MBS with 0 . 04 % ( w / v ) MS222 anaesthetic ( 3 - aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester methanesulfonate ) and 1 (cid:2) penicillin / streptomycin / Fungizone ( P / S / F ; Lonza ) , pH 7 . 4 ) . The higher osmolarity retards skin regrowth , allowing for experiments spanning sev - eral hours . Embryos were immobilised on low Petri dishes ( TPP , Switzerland ) coated with Sylgard 184 using bent 0 . 2 mm minutien pins , with one side of the body facing up . The eye , epidermis , and dura were removed with 0 . 1 or 0 . 15 mm minutien pins and fine forceps to expose one brain hemi - sphere from the dorsal to ventral midline and from the hindbrain to the telencephalon . Embryos were then immediately used for time - lapse in vivo AFM ( tiv - AFM ) measurements or , alternatively , transferred to a 4 - well plate containing either 1 . 3 (cid:2) MBS solution + 50 m M BI2536 ( MedChem Express ) ( control , 1 . 3 (cid:2) MBS solution + 0 . 5 % v / v DMSO ) or 1 . 3 (cid:2) MBS solution + 20 mM hydroxyurea and 150 m M aphidicolin ( control , 1 . 3 (cid:2) MBS solution + 1 . 5 % v / v DMSO ) and allowed to develop at ~ 25 ˚ C until the desired developmental stage . Embryo viability throughout all in vivo experiments was assessed by the presence of a visible heartbeat ( which begins at st . 33 / 34 ( Gurdon et al . , 1997 ) ) . Cryosectioning Xenopus embryos BI2536 inhibitor or mock - treated embryos were fixed at the requisite stages in 4 % PFA overnight at 4 ˚ C , washed thrice in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) for 10 min , and kept in 30 % sucrose for 1 hr at 4 ˚ C . The embryos were embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound ( OCT , VWR ) . 12 m m - thick coronal sections were made and collected on Superfrost plus slides ( ThermoScientific ) . In vitro assays Fabrication of polyacrylamide hydrogel substrates Polyacrylamide hydrogels were prepared as previously described ( Koser et al . , 2016 ) . Briefly , 19 mm ‘bottom’ coverslips were coated with 1N NaOH using a cotton bud and allowed to air dry . Cov - erslips were treated with ( 3 - aminopropyl ) trimethoxysilane ( APTMS ) for 3 min , washed thoroughly , treated with 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde solution for 30 min , and then washed and allowed to air - dry . 18 mm ‘top’ coverslips were treated with Rain - X ( Shell Car Care International Ltd , UK ) for 10 min and then dried . Gel pre - mixes were prepared using 40 % ( w / v ) acrylamide ( AA ) solution and 2 % bis - acrylamide ( Bis - AA ) solution ( Fisher Scientific , UK , or SIGMA ) diluted in PBS . Concentration titration measure - ments used a premix composition previously determined to give a shear modulus G ( a measure of stiffness ) of ~ 300 Pa ( 5 % AA , 0 . 07 % Bis - AA in PBS ) . For gels used for stiffness sensing experiments , the precise stiffness was measured using AFM . Stiff gels were comprised of 7 . 5 % AA / 0 . 2 % Bis - AA in PBS , resulting in a shear modulus of G ~ 5 , 500 Pa ; soft gels were comprised of 5 % AA / 0 . 04 % Bis - AA in PBS , resulting in G ~ 200 Pa . Premix polymerization was initiated by adding 5 m L ammonium persulfate followed by 1 . 5 m L of N , N , N’ , N’ - tetramethylethylenediamine ( TEMED , ThermoFisher ) . 25 m L of premix was pipetted onto the bottom coverslip and the top coverslip placed on top . Once the gel had polymerized , the top coverslip was removed and gels were treated with hydrazine hydrate for 3 . 5 – 4 hr , and then with 5 % acetic acid ( ACROS Organics ) for 1 hr . Gels were then washed , sterilized by 30 min UV treatment , and functionalized with 10 m g / mL Poly - D - lysine ( MW 70 , 000 – 150 , 000 ) overnight followed by 5 m g / mL laminin for 2 hr immediately prior to plating cells .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 39356 11 of 18 Short report Developmental Biology Physics of Living Systems Xenopus tissue culture and in vitro inhibitor treatments For eye primordia culture experiments , stage 33 / 34 or 35 / 36 embryos were placed in a Petri dish coated with Sylgard 184 ( Dow Corning ) and anaesthetized with 0 . 04 % ( w / v ) MS222 solution ( dis - solved in 1 (cid:2) MBS + 1 % v / v PSF , adjusted to pH 7 . 6 – 7 . 8 , and filter - sterilized ) . Whole eye primordia were dissected out using insect pins , and placed onto hydrogels with the lens facing up . BI2536 or control solution ( DMSO ) was added 2 hr after explants were plated . Dishes were cultured at 20 ˚ C for 22 – 24 hr in Xenopus cell culture medium ( 60 % L15 medium + 1 (cid:2) PSF , adjusted to pH 7 . 6 – 7 . 8 , and filter sterilized ) . In all experiments , DMSO controls utilized the amount of DMSO equivalent to that in the most concentrated BI 2536 condition ( 0 . 1 % v / v for concentration titration , 0 . 01 % v / v for stiff - ness sensing experiments ) . Explants were imaged on a Leica DMi8 inverted microscope with a 10 (cid:2) NA = 0 . 4 phase contrast objective . Sholl analysis of RGC axon outgrowth Eye primordia explant morphology was analyzed using the Sholl Analysis plugin in Fiji ( Ferreira et al . , 2014 ) . An ellipse was fitted to the explant , and the innermost ( starting ) radius set to R ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ A = p p , with A being the ellipse area . Images were filtered with an FFT bandpass filter to correct uneven background illumination and manually thresholded . The outer radius was set to a point beyond the reach of the longest axon . Spacing between consecutive measurements was set to 5 m m . ‘Median sholl radius’ was calculated as the median outgrowth radius reached by axons of a par - ticular explant . Fluorescence labelling of cellular structures Visualization of the optic tract and nuclei in wholemount brains Where required , to visualise the OT and nuclei for cell body density measurements , embryos at the desired developmental stage were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 1 . 5 – 2 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4 ˚ C . OTs were either labelled with ath5 : : GAP - eGFP or by injecting a solution of DiI crystals diluted in ethanol at the boundary between lens and the retina ( as previously described Wizenmann et al . , 2009 ) . Fixed brains were then dissected out and stained with 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ; 1 m g / ml ) . Stained specimens were mounted in either Fluoromount - G ( eBio - science , UK ; ath5 : : GAP - eGFP - labelled OTs ) or 1 (cid:2) PBS ( DiI - labelled OTs ) and the lateral brain sur - face , including the OT , was imaged using an SP - 8 confocal microscope ( SP8 , Leica Microsystems , UK ; 20 (cid:2) air , NA = 0 . 75 ; z - step size = 1 m m ) . Phospho - histone H3 immunolabelling and imaging in tissue cross - sections Sectioned tissues on slides were washed thrice in PBS , followed by three 10 min washes in PBS with 0 . 1 % TritonX . The sections were blocked in 5 % goat serum in PBS with 0 . 1 % TritonX for 30 – 45 min and incubated with Rabbit polyclonal anti - phospho - Histone H3 ( Ser10 ) ( EMD Millipore , 06 – 570 , dilu - tion = 1 : 1000 in blocking solution ) overnight at 4 ˚ C or for 2 hr at room temperature . This was fol - lowed by three 10 min washes in PBS and secondary antibody incubation with goat anti - rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 ( Abcam , ab150084 , dilution = 1 : 500 in blocking solution ) for 45 – 60 min . The slides were washed twice for 10 min with PBS and nuclei were labeled using 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI , 1 m g / ml ) . Sections were mounted with Fluoromount - G ( eBioscience ) and imaged with a confo - cal microscope ( SP8 , Leica Microsystems , UK ; 20 (cid:2) / 0 . 75 air and 63 (cid:2) / 1 . 4 oil ) . Z - stacks were taken across 8 m m of tissue ( z - step size = 1 m m ) . Only slices with eye tissue present were selected , to reli - ably ensure that the brain sections imaged and analysed were indeed exposed to the treatment sol - utions . This also allowed us to easily ascertain the intact - versus exposed - brain side in each section . In vivo AFM Probe and instrument preparation Tipless silicon cantilevers ( Arrow - TL1 , NanoWorld ) were calibrated using the thermal noise method ( Hutter and Bechhoefer , 1993 ) to determine the spring constant k , and those with k between 0 . 02 – 0 . 04 N / m were selected . Monodisperse spherical polystyrene beads ( diameter 37 . 28 ± 0 . 34 m m ; microParticles GmbH ) were glued to the cantilever ends as probes . Cantilevers were mounted on a CellHesion - 200 AFM head ( JPK Instruments ) , which was set up on an x / y motorised stage ( JPK Thompson et al . eLife 2019 ; 8 : e39356 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 39356 12 of 18 Short report Developmental Biology Physics of Living Systems Instruments ) controlled by custom - written Python scripts ( Koser et al . , 2016 ) . Indentation measure - ments ( maximum indentation force : 10 nN , approach speed : 5 m m / s , data rate : 1 , 000 Hz ) were per - formed automatically in a user - defined rectangular grid to create a 2 - D ‘stiffness map’ of the area . After each measurement , the cantilever was retracted by 100 m m , and the stage moved by a set dis - tance ( 20 – 25 m m ) to the next position ( Koser et al . , 2016 ) . Combined optical imaging and AFM measurements To allow simultaneous time - lapse imaging of the growing OT and in vivo stiffness measurements of live Xenopus brains , which are optically opaque , an upright epifluorescence set - up was custom - fit above the AFM head , which was based on a Zeiss AxioZoom V16 fluorescence stereomicroscope ( without eyepieces ) . The microscope was mounted on a custom - designed horizontal sliding stand ( parts obtained from ThorLabs ) via a custom - made adaptor ( K - Tec Microscope Services ) bolted to the side of the microscope ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . A long working distance objective with automatic zoom and high NA ( PlanApo Z 0 . 5 (cid:2) / 0 . 125 , working distance 114 mm , Zeiss ) allowed in vivo fluorescence imaging of RGC axons through the transparent AFM head , which was re - fitted with optical elements optimised for fluorescence imaging . The sample was illuminated through the AFM head using a metal halide lamp , and bright - field as well as epifluorescence images of the brain collected with an sCMOS camera ( Andor Zyla 4 . 2 ; quantum efficiency 82 % ) ( Figure 1a , b ) . Tiv - AFM Stage 33 / 34 embryos with ath5 : : GAP - eGFP - labelled OTs were prepared with one brain hemisphere exposed as described above , and those in which the OT was clearly visible ( but had not yet formed the mid - OT bend ) were selected . Embryos were mounted on the AFM motorised stage and a mea - surement region of approximately 150 (cid:2) 250 m m defined to include both the growing OT and the region of the mid - diencephalic turn . Images of the upper right and lower left corners of the selected region ( with cantilever approached ) were collected to identify the precise area mapped by the AFM . A stiffness map of the area was collected and the map iterated over the same area every ~ 35 min . At the end of every line in the measurement grid , the stage was moved back to a pre - defined loca - tion and a fluorescence image of the optic tract automatically collected . Temperature was main - tained at 25 ˚ C for the duration of the measurement by a PetriDish Heater ( JPK Instruments ) . Data analysis Processing of raw AFM data Force - distance curves obtained from stiffness measurements were analysed with a custom - written MATLAB script ( Koser et al . , 2016 ; Christ et al . , 2010 ) to obtain the reduced apparent elastic mod - ulus K . Raw AFM data were fitted to the Hertz model , F ¼ 4 3 K d 32 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ R p where F is the applied force , K the reduced apparent elastic modulus E / ( 1 - n 2 ) ( with Poisson ratio n ) , R the radius of the indenter , and d is sample indentation ( Crick and Yin , 2007 ; Hertz , 1882 ) . Force - distance curves were analysed at the maximum applied force F = 10 nN . Points where the AFM data were not analysable were excluded ; criteria for excluding individual force - distance curves were ( 1 ) inability to apply linear fits through the baseline region , for example due to noise , and ( 2 ) inability to apply good - quality Hertzian fits to the indentation region , that is , the fit did not align with the raw data . To minimise noise for region - of - interest analysis of small areas , previously sorted , gridded AFM data were smoothed in x - , y - , and time dimensions using an algorithm based on the discrete cosine transform by Garcia et al ( Garcia , 2010 ; Garcia , 2011 ) . Briefly , an iteratively weighted version of the penalized least squares approach was used to smooth the data and interpolate missing values where the force - distance curves were not analysable . Stiffness data from each experiment were arranged into a 3D array ( x * y * frame number ) and used as an argument for the smoothn . m MATLAB implemen - tation of the algorithm ( Garcia , 2010 ) . This algorithm has the advantage of using the entire data set to interpolate missing values , as opposed to only the nearest neighbouring data ( as , for example , in other smoothing methods such as a simple spline interpolation ) . Thompson et al . eLife 2019 ; 8 : e39356 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 39356 13 of 18 Short report Developmental Biology Physics of Living Systems For visual presentation of interpolated stiffness data , additional arrays of robustly smoothed K values were generated using the separate ‘robust’ option available in smoothn . m . This automatically reduces the weight assigned to high - leverage points and outliers , which optimises visualisation of overall changes in stiffness . To generate time - lapse montages of both raw and robustly smoothed AFM data , values of K were converted to 8 - bit scale , colour - coded maps using the desired MATLAB colourmap pre - set . The resulting stiffness maps were then mapped onto images of the brain and OT using custom - written MATLAB scripts ( Koser et al . , 2016 ) . Quantifying in vivo stiffness gradients Another MATLAB script ( Koser et al . , 2016 ) was used to calculate local tissue stiffness gradients in the area just ahead of the advancing OT . Mean values of K were calculated for a 50 (cid:2) 50 m m 2 region of interest ( ROI ) on the rostral ( K R ) and caudal sides ( K C ) of the OT , and the gradient calculated by : Stiffness gradient ¼ K R (cid:0) K C 50 (cid:22) m For each frame in a given time - lapse series , ROIs were defined three times and the mean of the three measurements for each ROI was used for further analysis . Where direct comparison between the dynamics of stiffness gradients and OT turning was required across different animals , values for both parameters were rescaled . The minimum value obtained for each embryo measured was set to 0 and the maximum set to 1 , using the following formula : Rescaled data ¼ data (cid:0) minimum value maximum value (cid:0) minimum value When linear fits to AFM data and OT turning angles were required , the built - in MATLAB first degree polynomial fit was used in all cases . Analysis of OT turning For each embryo , in vivo time - lapse movies of the growing OT were created by collating fluores - cence images taken at the beginning of every successive AFM stiffness map . The magnitude of the OT turn was calculated from each frame of these movies using the FIJI Angle tool . Three points were defined manually ( chiasm , mid - diencephalic turn , and end of OT ) such that the two lines drawn through these points ran through the centre of the OT . Each measurement was repeated three times , averaged , and subtracted from 180 ˚ to give the angle through which the OT had turned ; a positive value denotes turning in the caudal direction . Analysis of OT elongation Maximum projections were made across 10 m m confocal image stacks of wholemount brains with DiI - labelled OTs . The OTs were manually outlined in Adobe Illustrator . Elongation of the OT was cal - culated by the major - to - minor axis ratio using a previously described automated algorithm in Matlab ( Koser et al . , 2016 ) . In short , axes were determined by fitting ellipses , with the same normalized second central moment as the OT area , around the OTs . Cell body density measurements Confocal image stacks of fixed brains ( with fluorescently - labelled OT and nuclei ) were imported into FIJI . For each brain , the image where the leading axons were in focus was selected . A maximum intensity projection was generated of this image and one image above and below it in the stack . Two 50 m m (cid:2) 50 m m regions of interest ( matching the size of regions of interest used in stiffness gra - dient analysis ) were selected , rostral ( D R ) and caudal ( D C ) to the region corresponding to the OT caudal bend . Noise was removed with a Gaussian blur filter ( sigma = 2 . 0 ) . The resulting image was thresholded , with the threshold manually adjusted to capture all nuclei as accurately as possible . The image was binarised and the FIJI built - in function ‘Analyse Particle’ ( size : 1 – ¥ ; circularity : 0 . 2 – 1 . 00 ) was used to determine the area in each region covered by nuclei . Relative cell body density was cal - culated by dividing the area occupied by nuclei by the total region area . Where required , gradients in relative cell body density were obtained using : Thompson et al . eLife 2019 ; 8 : e39356 .

Maximum projections were made of the stacks ( z - stack height = 8 m m ) . The brain was identified in each section and both intact and exposed hemispheres were outlined . The area occupied by nuclei in each brain hemi - sphere was measured using the ‘Analyse > Measure’ tool . Normalised brain areas were obtained by calculating the ratio of exposed brain area to intact brain area . Quantification of phospho - histone H3 immunolabeling Confocal images taken with the 20 (cid:2) air objective were imported into FIJI . Maximum projections were made of the stacks ( z - stack height = 8 m m ) and pH3 + cells were counted and normalized to the total measured brain area in each section . The data is presented as the number of pH3 + cells per 10 , 000 m m 2 of brain tissue . number of pH3 þ cells brain area (cid:22) m 2 ð Þ (cid:3) 10 ; 000 Statistics and visualisation Data were collected from at least three independent experiments ( N (cid:21) 3 ) . The order of data collec - tion was randomized with no blinding and no data were excluded from the analysis . Non - parametric tests as well as linear regression analysis were used for statistical analyses of the data as described in the figure captions . R 2 values provide an estimate of the quality of the fits used in the plots . Pear - son’s correlation coefficient , on the other hand , provides a measure of the magnitude of correlation between the cell body density gradient and the stiffness gradient .
