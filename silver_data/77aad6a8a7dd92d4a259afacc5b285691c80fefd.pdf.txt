Cells rely on actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) to organize F - actin and to integrate its polymeric characteristics into diverse cellular processes . Yet , the multitude of ABPs that engage with and shape F - actin make studying a single ABP’s influence on cellular activities a significant challenge . Moreover , without a means of manipulating actin - binding subcellularly , harnessing the F - actin cytoskeleton for synthetic biology purposes remains elusive . Here , we describe a suite of designed proteins , Controllable Actin - binding Switch Tools ( CASTs ) , whose actin - binding behavior can be controlled with external stimuli . CASTs were developed that respond to different external inputs , providing options for turn - on kinetics and enabling orthogonality . Being genetically encoded , we show that CASTs can be inserted into native protein sequences to control F - actin association locally and engineered into new structures to control cell and tissue shape and behavior . Introduction Filamentous proteins of the cytoskeleton drive activities necessary to sustain life , including migration 1 – 3 , adhesion 4 – 6 , endocytosis 7 , 8 , and cell division 9 – 12 . One example is actin , a highly abundant protein that can form filaments ( F - actin ) within cells . F - actin adopts multiple higher - order structures 13 , and cells rely on these distinct architectures to facilitate many actions . To organize F - actin into different architectures subcellularly , actin - binding proteins bind directly to F - actin , influencing the local kinetics of F - actin assembly and integrating F - actin into multiprotein complexes 14 . In this molecular logic , local abundance and activity of actin - binding proteins regulate how the wide variety of F - actin - dependent processes unfold in living cells . The largest and most diverse set of actin - binding proteins are those that interface with the sides of actin filaments 15 , 16 . Within these proteins , actin - binding domains ( ABDs ) recognize surfaces and grooves built from multiple monomers of actin 17 – 20 . Proteins possessing ABDs often contain additional domains , linking F - actin side binding to other protein activities . In certain cases , ABDs are combined with sequences that mediate actin - specific functions , such as filament severing and polymerization , motor activity , and multiple filament crosslinking , providing feedback between actin binding and filament assembly and disassembly 14 . With such a large repertoire of ABD - containing proteins , recent work has focused on the timing and location of single protein engagement with F - actin and the subsequent impact on cell behavior . For instance , the ERM protein , ezrin , was found to associate with membrane - proximal F - actin after phosphorylation of threonine 567 , in turn regulating cell cortex mechanics 21 , 22 . Yet , despite a few notable examples , probing the role of a single actin - binding protein in a multistep cellular process remains a significant challenge due to the lack of tools to control single ABD - F - actin associations . At present , most methods for manipulating cellular actin cause global perturbation to F - actin structures and binding . Commonly used small molecule drugs and natural products , including latrunculin A and cytochalasin D , disrupt F - actin across the entire cell 23 – 27 , and genetic 2 alterations , such as ABD deletions , lead to constitutive off states 28 – 31 , a major limitation for determining when actin binding is necessary . Several widely used probes exist for visualizing and decorating actin filaments in living cells 32 , but imaging and colocalization experiments , unfortunately , do not report on ABD activity . Rather , an approach that controls one ABD against a background of many other ABDs would offer the specificity needed for isolating the impact of single ABD - F - actin engagement . As well , manipulating the F - actin association would enable temporal control over F - actin - dependent cellular properties , a goal for synthetic biology applications in eukaryotic cells . Here , we take advantage of short actin - binding motifs ( ABMs ) to engineer a new suite of Controllable Actin - binding Switch Tools ( CASTs ) in cells . We and others have recently described native ABMs that consist of short peptide sequences capable of F - actin engagement , including ZO - 1’s ABS 33 , F - tractin 34 , and Lifeact 35 . To construct CASTs , our approach relies on installing intramolecular binders on the ends of ABM peptides . By optimizing intramolecular binding , the peptides are forced to adopt constrained or occluded conformations that limit F - actin binding , shifting their association to an inactive state ( Fig . 1 ) . The addition of a stimulus , which releases intramolecular binding , then activates the ABM , allowing the sequence to adopt a conformation competent for engaging F - actin . Below , we report on three CASTs that offer different turn - on timescales and orthogonal triggering in living cells . As the described CASTS are genetically encoded , we demonstrate their insertion into multi - domain protein structures to control single protein actin - binding activity in living cells and tissue . We also show that protein switches can be combined with other design elements to generate synthetic actin regulatory proteins that re - organize actin filaments in the presence of a stimulus . These molecular tools provide researchers with new options 36 – 39 for studying single protein F - actin association and for engineering cytoskeletal architectures within living cells . Results and Discussion Engineering CASTs to Control F - actin Binding Native ABM sequences spontaneously adopt active conformations that engage with F - actin ( Fig . 1 ) . Recently solved Cryo - EM structures for the ABM , Lifeact , show an active a - helical structure bound to F - actin at an n / n + 2 site near F - actin’s D - loop 18 , 40 . Active ABM conformations , such as Lifeact’s , represent more energetically stable structures in the presence of F - actin compared to inactive states . To construct F - actin protein switches , we sought to re - engineer ABM structures , such that they adopt inactive , yet stable , states . We reasoned that short ABMs would be more sensitive to structural changes compared to larger ABDs since ABMs lack buffering amino acids or domain architectures , offering an opportunity for rational - based design . To inactivate ABMs , we settled on an approach where intramolecular binders are placed on the N - and C - termini of the ABM sequence . Termini binding would lead to a stable state that conformationally constrains or occludes the ABM , rendering it inactive ( Fig . 1 ) . Strong intramolecular binding can then be disrupted by activators , such as peptides , small molecules , or light , that relieve the constraint on the ABM and favor the active form of the ABM structure . Here , we focus on engineering two native ABMs , ZO - 1’s ABS and Lifeact ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) , the latter a higher affinity ABM sequence toward F - actin and a widely used F - actin marker in cells 35 , into CASTs . With our strategy , the ABM’s active state would be perturbed in the switch’s ‘off’ state , and upon activation , a conformational change would ensue , leading to an unconstrained conformation and resulting in the ‘on’ state . To directly translate our approach to living cells , we screened CAST candidates in cells using microscopy and co - stained for F - actin to characterize the CAST’s properties . 3 Peptide - Based CASTs for Long Timescale Activation For our first CAST design , we took advantage of heterospecific synthetic peptides , SynZips ( SZs ) , that form coiled - coil interactions with their peptide partners 41 . SZ4 binds to either SZ3 or SZ21 , albeit with a significantly higher affinity for SZ21 . We envisioned a design , where SZ3 and SZ4 bind intramolecularly ( Fig . 2a ) , which would disrupt the active form of the ABM constrained between them . Expression of SZ21 , the stimulus in this case , would outcompete intramolecular binding , relieving the constraint on the ABM and leading to F - actin association . Modeling predicted a parallel coiled - coil for the interaction between SZ3 and SZ4 and a C - to N - terminal distance of 7 . 4 nm ( Fig . 2b ) . This distance must be spanned by the ABM and any adjacent amino acids to allow for intramolecular binding . Since ABMs are short peptide sequences , we considered three different scenarios ( Fig . 2c ) : i ) the ABM length alone does not span the 7 . 4 nm distance , leaving the ABM in the active state , ii ) a linker sequence on either end of the ABM accommodates the 7 . 4 nm distance , inactivating the ABM by constraining its conformation , and iii ) additional linker sequences span the required distance for intramolecular binding but do not result in ABM inactivation . To estimate the amino acid lengths necessary to span the C - to N - terminal distance , we applied a worm - like chain ( WLC ) model of linker sequences to predict the end - to - end distance distributions 42 , 43 for both ZO - 1’s ABS and Lifeact ( Fig . 2d ) . Probabilities over 0 . 01 were observed for linker lengths with > 50 amino acids ( AAs ) . Accordingly , we designed and cloned long linker SZ - based CAST constructs containing 0 - 9 five AA - long linkers on both sides of the ABMs , pep0 - pep9 , for ABS and Lifeact ( Fig . 2d ) . To examine ABM activity , we expressed pep0 - pep9 designs in HeLa cells , which present abundant actin filaments within stress fibers and lamellipodial structures 44 , 45 , and stained for endogenous F - actin using phalloidin ( Fig . 3a , c , Supplementary Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . We observed similar F - actin engagement for short and long linker pep designs compared to ABM - only controls , as was anticipated from the structural demands of the SZ3 - SZ4 interaction ( see above ) . However , for intermediate linker lengths , we observed robust inactivation of ABM F - actin - binding activity . Using the phalloidin stain as a mask , we compared the fluorescence intensities of the pep0 - 9 designs on F - actin to the intensities in the cytoplasm and calculated a percent inhibition of F - actin engagement compared to the native ABM’s localization ( Fig . 3b , d ) . Designs with > 50 % inhibition were considered inactive . For both ABS and Lifeact , the pep6 designs , containing 60 AA linker residues , yielded the highest levels of inactivation and were selected for further development ( termed pepCAST ) . With pepCAST candidates , we turned our attention to the activation of the ABM upon the introduction of SZ21 . The presence of SZ21 should disrupt SZ3 - SZ4 intramolecular binding and enable ABM engagement with F - actin . To test this , we expressed pepCASTs of ABS and Lifeact in the presence or absence of SZ21 . Only in the presence of SZ21 did activation and F - actin engagement of pepCASTs occur ( Fig . 3e ) , with the ABS pepCAST reaching > 80 % activation . The stimulus alone , SZ21 , was entirely cytoplasmic , but upon dual expression with pepCASTs , SZ21 transitioned to decorating F - actin filaments , consistent with an intermolecular interaction leading to activation of the pepCASTs . To determine the kinetics of pepCAST activation , we first generated stable cells expressing either the ABS pepCAST or the Lifeact pepCAST . With these cells , we expressed SZ21 from an inducible promoter ( Fig . 3f ) . SZ21 expression was observable two hours after induction with Anhydrotetracycline ( ATc ) ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , and we quantified pepCAST F - actin engagement from this time point over the course of 7 hours . Both pepCASTs activated as pseudo first - order rate processes on the timescale ( t 1 / 2 ) of 2 - 3 hours ( Fig . 3g and Supplementary Video 1 ) . Our results suggest that intramolecular binding , indeed , leads to inactivity of both ZO - 1’s ABS and Lifeact , and that F - actin engagement can be restored by disrupting intramolecular binding with a stimulus , in this case SZ21 . 4 Small molecule - based CAST Leads to Faster Activation Encouraged by our pepCAST results , we next sought to develop other CAST systems with different turn - on kinetics and stimuli , providing tools that can be used for a variety of actin experiments requiring compatible turn - on times and involving multiple actin - binding proteins . Small molecules as stimuli offer fast turn - on kinetics since they can readily diffuse through the cell membrane and bind to their targets with large rate constants 46 , 47 . Several small molecules are known to bind tightly to both the catalytically competent and the catalytically dead NS3a protease from the hepatitis C virus and have been used previously to trigger cellular processes 48 – 51 . To take advantage of these small molecules as stimuli for CASTs , we constructed several possible CAST constructs by fusing catalytically dead NS3a and an NS3a binding ligand ( CP5 - 46A - 4D5E , referred to here as CP5 ) 52 , to the termini of the ABMs with and without linkers ( Fig . 4a ) . One arrangement , sm2 , caused noticeable disruption to F - actin engagement ( Fig . 4b - d ) . Using AlphaFold2 53 , 54 , we compared a model for the ABS to that of sm2 , which we termed smCAST ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . The model indicated that ABS in isolation sits as an a - helix . However , within smCAST , the ABS appeared constrained , where it adopts a disordered structure , a conformational change that would inhibit ABS’s F - actin activity when embedded in smCAST . To examine activation of smCAST , we incubated smCAST - expressing HeLa cells with either Asunaprevir ( Asu ) , Danoprevir ( Dano ) , or Grazoprevir ( Grazo ) , small molecules known to bind tightly to NS3a’s active site 55 , 56 . In all cases , activation of smCAST and corresponding F - actin engagement occurred , with Asu giving rise to the highest level of activation ( Fig . 4e ) . We also visualized smCAST over time in cells that were treated with the different drugs . Similar to pepCASTs , smCAST followed pseudo first - order turn - on kinetics . However , in contrast to pepCASTs , smCAST activated faster than pepCASTs , on the timescale ( t 1 / 2 ) of 20 to 30 minutes , with Asu providing the fastest response of the small molecules tested ( Fig . 4f , g and Supplementary Video 2 ) . This data suggests that varying the intramolecular binders and types of stimuli can lead to new CAST systems with different turn - on kinetics . Rapid Activation of Light - based CASTs pepCAST and smCAST activate on hours and tens of minutes timescales , respectively . Still , some cellular processes occur on shorter timescales ( single minutes ) and , as such , demand more rapid turn - on 57 , 58 . Light - sensitive protein domains , for example , LOV 59 , 60 and CRY 61 , 62 domains , are known to isomerize and conformationally change on shorter timescales 63 than pepCAST’s and smCAST’s activation . To test whether light can act as a stimulus for CAST activation , we designed optical CASTs , opto1 - opto2 , by fusing either AsLOV2 - Ja’ or a mutant with stronger intramolecular association ( AsLOV2 L514J - Ja’ L531E ) 64 to the ABMs . LOV2 domains can sterically occlude short peptide sequences 64 , 65 , which motivated us to examine protein architectures with ABMs at the terminus . For both opto1 and opto2 , we observed significant inhibition of F - actin - binding activity , with Lifeact opto1 reaching ~ 90 % inhibition ( Fig . 5b , c ) . The opto1 constructs , termed optoCASTs , were subsequently tested for activation with blue light illumination . This resulted in rapid and effective redistribution of optoCASTs to F - actin in cells ( Fig . 5d ) , achieving 80 % activation , with a t 1 / 2 of 3 - 5 minutes ( Fig . 5e , f and Supplementary Video 3 ) . With smCAST and optoCAST – two switches that can be activated within the same order of magnitude – in hand , we next examined whether orthogonal triggering was possible . To do this , we co - expressed smCAST and Lifeact optoCAST in cells and triggered activation with either small molecules , such as Asu , Dano , and Grazo , or blue light ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . In the presence of small molecule stimuli , activation of smCAST ensued with re - localization of smCAST to F - actin , while optoCAST remained cytoplasmic . Similarly , blue light stimulus caused optoCAST to decorate F - actin , whereas smCAST remained cytoplasmic . Together , these experiments show 5 that each CAST is sensitive to its distinct stimulus and that multiple CASTs can be used simultaneously for multiplexed and orthogonal control over F - actin binding in cells . Dimeric optoCASTs Enable Control Over F - actin Architecture and Cell Shape with Light By varying F - actin’s organization , cells regulate their shape , movement , and mechanics . Bundled filaments , for instance , represent a prominent F - actin architecture in stress fibers and at the cell cortex 13 , 66 , 67 . CASTs offer an opportunity to induce F - actin re - organization and subsequent cellular responses by engineering the intramolecular - bound states into structures that can alter F - actin architecture dynamically . Dimeric ABD - containing proteins , so - called actin crosslinkers , are responsible for forming bundled filaments in the cell 68 – 70 , and we reasoned that generating a dimeric CAST should provide control over filament bundling in a user - defined manner . To construct multimeric CASTs in cells , we appended a self - dimerizing peptide sequence to the N - terminus of optoCASTs , termed dOptoABS and dOptoLifeact ( Fig . 6a ) , and expressed these sequences in HEK 293 cells , which lack extensive bundled filaments ( Supplementary Fig . 6a ) . After illuminating with blue light , we observed dramatic re - organization of F - actin into heavily crosslinked architectures at both the cell periphery and in the cell body for both dOptoABS and dOptoLifeact ( Fig . 6b and Supplementary Video 4 ) . Coincident with crosslinking , cells also appeared to contract after blue light triggering . Quantification of cell area indicated an area reduction of approximately 10 % for dOptoABS and 20 % for dOptoLifeact upon activation . Next , we wondered whether triggering actin crosslinking and cell area changes would be possible in more crowded environments , such as in tissues . We , consequently , expressed either dOptoABS or dOptoLifeact in MDCKII epithelial monolayers and activated with blue light . After blue light illumination , we observed similar F - actin re - organization as in isolated cell experiments ( Fig . 6c and Supplementary Video 5 ) , but , in the case of tissue , we also found that cell contacts were disrupted with the majority of cells becoming detached from their neighbors after dimeric CAST activation . These experiments show that CASTs are amenable to further engineering for synthetic biology applications , where control over F - actin organization is desired . Manipulating Proteins and Cellular Processes Dynamically by Replacing Native ABDs with CASTs Finally , we sought to test whether CASTs can be used in place of a native ABD to control protein activity in cells . To do this , we focused on the junctional protein , ZO - 1 , which plays an active role in focal adhesion formation and cell migration 71 , 72 . ZO - 1 , a major component of the tight junction in epithelial tissue , also helps drive persistent migration of subconfluent cells by interacting with integrin a 5 b 1 and regulating focal adhesions 73 , 74 . We expressed either wildtype ZO - 1 ( WT ZO - 1 ) or ZO - 1 lacking its ABS ( ZO - 1 D ABS ) in subconfluent cells ( Fig . 7a ) and found that , indeed , WT ZO - 1 localizes to focal complexes at the cell periphery and to larger focal adhesion clusters under the cell body ( Fig . 7b ) . In contrast , ZO - 1 D ABS primarily localized to small focal complexes on the cell periphery , indicating that ZO - 1’s engagement with F - actin modulates its adhesion activity . Next , we constructed a version of ZO - 1 that replaces ZO - 1’s native ABS sequence with our ABS smCAST , termed ZO - 1smCAST ( Fig . 7a ) . From our data above , we anticipated that if actin - binding of ZO - 1 occurred , then the protein would populate larger focal adhesion clusters over time . By fluorescence microscopy , we first imaged ZO - 1smCAST and found that it localizes to small focal complexes at the cell periphery ( Fig . 7c ) , similar to ZO - 1 D ABS . After activation with either Asu , Dano , or Grazo , however , ZO - 1smCAST re - localized over the course of 60 min , occupying larger focal adhesions under the cell body and mirroring that of WT ZO - 1 ( Fig . 7c and Supplementary Video 6 ) , ( Fig . 7d , e ) . Encouraged by these results , we then turned to a wound healing assay of collective cell migration . We’ve previously shown that ZO proteins , including ZO - 1 , are essential for epithelial cell migration using a knockout line for ZO - 1 6 and ZO - 2 72 . To this knockout line , we expressed either WT ZO - 1 or ZO - 1smCAST and performed a wound healing experiment . WT ZO - 1 - expressing cells were able to migrate and close the wound area over the course of 24 h , whereas the ZO - 1smCAST - expressing cells did not close the wound area after 52 h ( Fig . 7f - h ) , suggesting that ZO - 1’s ability to bind to F - actin is necessary for collective migration . To test this directly , we repeated the wound healing assay with ZO - 1smCAST - expressing cells and added Asu , Dano , or Grazo to activate the smCAST module within ZO - 1’s structure . Gratifyingly , in all cases , ZO - 1smCAST - expressing cells were able to migrate and close the wound area in the presence of small molecule stimuli on timescales similar to WT ZO - 1 - expressing cells ( Fig . 7f - i and Supplementary Fig . 7a - c ) . Small molecule stimuli , Asu , Dano , or Grazo , had no effect on WT ZO - 1 - expressing cells . Taken together , our data show that CASTs can be incorporated into the primary sequence of endogenous proteins to control their engagement with F - actin in both cells and tissue . Conclusion F - actin plays numerous roles throughout the cell . A diverse set of proteins bearing an ABD orchestrate the varied activities of F - actin . Identifying which ABD - containing proteins are necessary for certain cellular processes and defining their time evolution of actin engagement remain challenging due to a lack of compatible probes and molecular tools . Here , we developed CASTs , which enable control over ABD activity in response to peptide , small molecule , or light stimuli . CASTs add to a growing toolbox of engineered proteins that can be expressed and subsequently activated to probe the influence of F - actin 75 – 78 . CASTs offer different timescales of activation and the possibility of multiplexing as they can be triggered orthogonally . We showed that CASTs can be inserted into native protein sequences , allowing user - defined manipulation of single protein ABD activity in a background of abundant and diverse ABDs . We also found that CASTs can be further engineered into synthetic structures , creating architectures that re - organize the cytoskeleton . Since CASTs are genetically encoded , their use is facile and will provide researchers with a much - needed strategy for uncovering key aspects of the cytoskeleton and for manipulating cell mechanics and behavior in a user - defined manner . Experimental Model and Subject Details Cell culture and cell lines HeLa and HEK 293T cells were a gift from Jeanne Stachowiak ( UT Austin ) , and MDCK II cells were a gift from Keith Mostov ( UCSF ) . All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 in high glucose DMEM ( 4 . 5 g / l ) , supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( pen - strep ) . All transient transfections were performed using FuGENE HD ( Promega ) at a ratio of 1 : 1 and 3 : 1 FuGENE HD : DNA ( µL : µg ) for HeLa and HEK 293T cells , respectively . For transfections , an 8 - well chambered cover glass ( Cellvis # C8 - 1 . 5H - N ) was coated with fibronectin ( Sigma - Aldrich # F0895 ) before cells were seeded and left to grow overnight . The DNA was mixed with transfection reagent , added to the cells , and then allowed to incubate overnight at 37 °C . Transfection efficiency was confirmed the next day through confocal imaging . Stable cell lines were generated through lentivirus infection . Briefly , HEK 293T cells were transfected using TransIT - 293 ( Mirus ) according to manufacturer’s instructions with three plasmids , pMD . 2g , p8 . 91 , and the construct - of - interest cloned into a pHR vector . Cells were grown for 3 days , after which media was collected and the virus was concentrated with Lenti - X ( Clontech ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . Freshly passaged MDCK II cells or HeLa cells cultured for 24 hours were transduced with the collected virus and were grown for two days before passaging and removing media . Stable cell lines created with fluorescently tagged proteins were sorted and normalized for expression using a Sony MA900 Cell Sorter at the UT Austin 7 Center for Biomedical Research Support Microscopy and Flow Cytometry Facility . After sorting , cell lines were cultured for 2 - 3 days and fluorescence was confirmed with confocal imaging . Method Details General methods All of the chemical reagents were of analytical grade , obtained from commercial suppliers , and used without further purification unless otherwise noted . Alexa Fluor 488 and 647 phalloidin were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific . Anhydrotetracycline ( ATc ) was obtained from ThermoFisher Scientific ( # AAJ66688MA ) . For smCAST experiments , Asunaprevir ( Asu # HY - 14434 ) and Grazoprevir ( Grazo # HY - 15298 ) were purchased from MedChem Express , and Danoprevir ( Dano # RG7227 ) was purchased from ApexBio . Stock solutions were prepared and stored according to manufacturer’s instructions . Working small molecule solutions were obtained by diluting reconstituted stocks in serum - free media . Fluorescence imaging was carried out on an Eclipse Ti2 microscope ( Nikon ) equipped with 405 / 488 / 560 / 640nm lasers ( Andor ) , a Dragonfly 500 high - speed spinning disk confocal module ( Andor ) , and a Zyla 4 . 2 sCMOS camera ( Andor ) . Fluorescence micrographs of cells were acquired with a 60x objective ( Nikon , NA 1 . 49 TIRF ) at 2x camera magnification ( unless stated otherwise ) and were analyzed using Fiji ( ImageJ ) and MATLAB . Plasmid construction All PCR and ligation reactions were performed with OneTaq polymerase and Gibson Assembly Master Mix from New England Biolabs ( NEB ) , respectively . Vector digestions were performed with HindIII - HF ( NEB ) and EcoRI - HF ( NEB ) for pcDNA vectors and MluI ( NEB ) and NotI ( NEB ) for pHR vectors . All recombinant DNA was isolated and purified through Miniprep kits according to manufacturer’s instructions ( Qiagen ) . Sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing . Peptide - Based CAST Designs DNA encoding SZ3 - linker - ABM - linker SZ4 - eGFP sequences was obtained via Gibson Assembly . Designs pep1 - 9 included a ( GGGGS ) n flexible linker on either end of the ABM , where 1 £ n £ 9 . For pepCAST activation , SZ21 was fused by Gibson Assembly to mCherry at its C - terminus with flexible linker units between the two fragments . Plasmids encoding SZ 3 , 4 , and 21 were obtained from Addgene ( Addgene plasmid # 80659 , # 80660 , and # 80675 ) . SZ sequences were amplified via PCR and the fragments were cloned into a digested pcDNA vector backbone . For plasmid constructs with ³ 60 total AA residues of flexible linker , the ABM with the linker residues and Gibson Assembly overhangs was obtained as a g - Block from Integrated DNA Technologies ( IDT ) . Small molecule - based CAST Designs Switch modules were designed with NS3a or CP5 on either end of the ABM and with a C - terminal eGFP . Additional variants were designed to include a GGGGS flexible linker on either end of the ABM . Gibson Assembly was used to generate the DNA encoding sequences . Plasmids encoding NS3a and CP5 were obtained from Addgene ( Addgene plasmid # 133608 and # 133614 ) . Cloning was performed similarly to the peptide - based CAST designs through PCR amplification and Gibson Assembly of the fragments . Optical - based CAST Designs Amino acids 403 - 540 of the AsLOV2 sequence 65 were amplified by PCR . ABMs were fused to the C - terminus of AsLOV2 immediately after AA 540 while mCherry was fused to the N - 8 terminus of the amplified AsLOV2 sequence followed by a flexible linker unit ( SRGGSGGSGGSPR ) . All fragments were joined together by Gibson Assembly ( mCherry - LOV - ABM ) . Variants with L514K and L531E mutations on the AsLOV2 domain were designed similarly 64 . To construct dimeric versions of the optoCAST ( dOptoCAST ) , a self - recognizing dimerization domain ( DD ) 79 was appended to the optoCAST sequence . The DD sequence was fused to the N - terminus of mCherry followed by two flexible linker units ( GGGGS ) 2 for dOptoABS ( DD - mCherry - LOV - ABS ) or placed between mCherry and the LOV domain , also with two flexible linker units , ( GGGGS ) 2 , between mCherry and DD for dOptoLifeact ( mCherry - DD - LOV - ABS ) . The AsLOV2 plasmid was acquired from Addgene ( Addgene plasmid # 80406 ) . The LOV2 mutant and DD sequences were obtained as g - Blocks from IDT . Cloning was performed similarly to the peptide - based CAST designs through PCR amplification and Gibson Assembly of the fragments . ZO - 1 - smCAST ZO - 1smCAST was obtained by introducing smCAST in place of ABS by making use of a plasmid we previously generated containing ZO - 1 with a deleted ABS ( ZO - 1 D ABS ) 33 . For cloning of smCAST into ZO - 1 D ABS , a pHR plasmid encoding the ZO - 1 D ABS sequence was digested using Ajil ( BmgBI ) from ThermoFisher Scientific . The ‘GACGTG’ enzyme recognition sequence was generated during the cloning for deletion of the ABS . Cloning steps are similar to those described in the plasmid construction and CAST design sections above with PCR for fragment amplification and Gibson Assembly for ligation . Fluorescence microscopy HeLa , HEK 293T , and MDCK II cells expressing plasmids with fluorescent proteins were seeded in 8 - well chambered cover glass as previously described in the cell culture section above . The inhibited or activated states were imaged by acquiring fluorescent micrographs in the absence or presence of SZ21 peptide , small molecule inhibitor , or blue light for the peptide - , small molecule - , and optical - based CASTs , respectively . For quantification of F - actin binding inhibition and activation , CAST - expressing cells in the absence or presence of SZ21 peptide , small molecule inhibitor or blue light were fixed with 4 % PFA ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , permeabilized with Triton X - 100 ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) and stained with 0 . 1 µM Alexa Fluor 488 or 647 phalloidin ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) for F - actin visualization . CAST activation kinetics pepCAST Stable HeLa cells expressing either pepCAST ABS or pepCAST Lifeact were cultured and seeded in 8 - well chambered cover glass as previously described in the cell culture section above . 24 hours after seeding , the cells were co - transfected with a TetR - expressing plasmid and a TetO 2 - containing SZ21 - mCherry plasmid at a ratio of 6 : 1 ( 460 ng total DNA ) and allowed to incubate overnight . SZ21 expression was induced with the addition of 1 µM ATc , and fluorescence micrographs were acquired every 20 minutes for 7 hours to image pepCAST and SZ21 localization . smCAST WT HeLa cells were cultured and seeded in 8 - well chambered cover glass as previously described in the cell culture section . 24 hours after seeding , the cells were transfected with smCAST and incubated overnight . Next , media was removed from the wells and 10 µM Asu , Dano , or Grazo in serum - free media was added in its place . The well was mounted on the microscope and fluorescence images were acquired every 5 minutes for 1 . 5 hours to image smCAST localization . 9 optoCAST WT HeLa cells were cultured and seeded in 8 - well chambered cover glass as previously described in the cell culture section . 24 hours after seeding , the cells were transfected with optoCAST ABS or optoCAST Lifeact and incubated overnight . Activation and imaging were performed using the following excitation settings : simultaneous 405 nm ( 25 mW ) , 488 nm ( 55 mW ) , and 561 nm ( 55 mW ) lasers at 55 % , 90 % , and 8 % laser powers , respectively . This provided blue light illumination to the cells through the 405 nm and 488 nm laser lines and allowed visualization of the mCherry - tagged optoCASTs through the 561 nm laser line . Sample irradiation occurred via combined laser line pulses every 2 . 5 seconds for the duration of the experiment ( 8 - 15 minutes ) . F - actin binding quantification in cells F - actin binding quantification was performed using Fiji and MATLAB . Briefly , a custom macro script written in Fiji was used to demarcate single cells and separate the CAST candidate channel and the total F - actin channel for each cell . A custom MATLAB code was then written to binarize the total F - actin image and perform background subtraction on the CAST candidate channel . Pixel intensities of the processed CAST candidate channel were used to quantify localization to F - actin and the cytoplasm with the binarized F - actin image as a mask . The following ratio represents the extent of F - actin binding : < I F - actin > < I cyto > . The percent inhibition or activation of each CAST candidate was calculated relative to the intensity ratio of the GFP - only control ( 0 % ) and GFP - ABM control ( 100 % ) for inhibition or the inhibited pep , sm , optoCAST ( 0 % ) and the GFP - ABM control ( 100 % ) for activation . For activation kinetics , F - actin binding quantification was performed as described above but on a frame - by - frame basis . CAST activation kinetic data was fit to a one - phase exponential association model with GraphPad . The computed half - time ( t 1 / 2 ) represents the time taken to achieve 50 % of the max F - binding ratio . Cell contraction and area change analysis HEK 293T cells were cultured and seeded in 8 - well chambered cover glass as previously described in the cell culture section above . dOptoCASTs were co - transfected with eGFP at a 1 : 1 ratio ( 460 ng total DNA ) . Photoactivation was performed as described for optoCAST for 10 minutes . Cell area changes were determined based on the eGFP - only channel before and after activation using Fiji . Stable MDCK II lines expressing dOptoCASTs were generated via Lentivirus and cultured in 8 - well chambered cover glass . Photoactivation was performed similarly as in the HEK 293Ts . Analysis of cell monolayer detachment was performed by counting single - cell detachment events within clusters of cells . ZO - 1smCAST activation and localization analysis WT HeLa cells were cultured and seeded in 8 - well chambered cover glass as previously described . 24 hours after seeding , the cells were transfected with WT ZO - 1 or ZO - 1smCAST and incubated overnight . Activation was performed by the addition of 10 µM small molecule inhibitor in serum - free media . Fluorescence images were acquired every 5 minutes for 60 minutes to observe ZO - 1 localization . ZO - 1 cluster size was determined using the Fiji plug - in . Wound healing assay WT MDCK II cells and a ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 null MDCK II cell line ( dKO ) 33 were cultured as previously described . dKO cells were used to generate stable cell lines expressing WT ZO - 1 and ZO - 1smCAST fusions via Lentivirus . For the wound healing assay , stable cell lines were seeded at a density of 400 , 000 cells / well on fibronectin - coated 8 - well chambered cover glass and incubated overnight to form a monolayer . On the day of the experiment , the cells were washed 3 times with 1X PBS before a sterile 200 µL tip was used to create a wound in the monolayer by 10 scratching the surface of the well . The wells were washed with 1X PBS to remove unadhered cells and then incubated with serum - free media or serum - free media supplemented with 10 µM of small molecule inhibitor . An image of each well was acquired immediately after wounding , and the cells were incubated at 37°C until subsequent image acquisitions over the course of 3 days . Analysis of cell migration , including wound area over time and wound healing velocity , was performed using Fiji . Protein structure modeling and analysis Structural predictions for SZ3 , SZ4 , ZO - 1’s ABS , and smCAST were obtained via AlphaFold2 modeling 53 , 54 and visualized on ChimeraX . The top - ranking models ( rank 1 ) were chosen for analysis . To estimate the end - to - end distance of SZ3 and SZ4 , a model predicting the SZ3 : SZ4 bound state was generated by introducing a very long flexible linker ( GGGGS ) fused to SZ3 and SZ4 through their C - and N - terminus , respectively . The flexible linker was omitted in the model shown in Fig . 2 . Distances were then measured using the distance tool in ChimeraX . WLC model For pepCAST designs , the end - to - end probability distributions for varying residue lengths were determined according to the worm - like chain ( WLC ) model 43 . The contour length ( l c ) used in the model was calculated as the product of the number of peptide bonds and the length of a single residue ( 3 . 8 Å ) . The persistence length used was 3 . 04 Å found for GS linkers 42 , 43 . Statistics Statistical analyses were performed in Prism 9 ( GraphPad Software ) . Specific statistical tests used are noted in figure legends for the corresponding experiments .

Engineering Controllable Actin - binding Switch Tools ( CASTs ) from actin - binding motifs . Peptide actin - binding motifs ( ABMs ) adopt conformations capable of recognizing and binding filamentous actin ( F - actin ) ( top panel ) , where the bound complexes are energetically favored . To control ABM binding to F - actin , intramolecular binders can be engineered into ABMs’ termini ( bottom panels ) , giving rise to Controllable Actin - binding Switch Tools ( CASTs ) . The intramolecular association leads to energetically favorable unbound forms in the presence of F - actin . ABMs can be either ( i ) conformationally constrained ( bottom left ) or ( ii ) sterically occluded ( bottom right ) to disrupt native F - actin binding . Introduction of a stimulus ( red star ) that relieves the constraint or steric hinderance would then favor the bound F - actin form of the CAST , turning ‘on’ binding to F - actin in a user - defined manner . Figure 2 . Design of a peptide - responsive CAST . a , Schematic of a peptide - based CAST system . The ABM is initially constrained ( grey ) in an ‘off’ state by two SynZip sequences , SZ3 and SZ4 , which form a coiled coil interaction intramolecularly . After the introduction of a peptide stimulus ( SZ21 ) , which outcompetes SZ3 for SZ4 binding , a transition to the active ‘on’ state ( blue ) capable of F - actin binding occurs . b , AlphaFold2 model prediction of SZ3 : SZ4 complex with a C - to - N - terminal distance of 7 . 4 nm . c , Structural considerations for initial ‘off’ state of CASTs . The C - to - N - terminal distance of the SZ3 : SZ4 complex must be spanned by the interdomain residues . Flexible linkers can be installed on either end of the ABM to increase interdomain length . Short linker lengths impede SZ3 : SZ4 binding , allowing the ABM to remain active ( left ) . Long linker lengths , on the other hand , lead to SZ3 : SZ4 binding but no constraint on ABM ( right ) . Only the optimal linker length will allow for both SZ3 : SZ4 interaction and a conformational constraint on the ABM ( middle ) , resulting in the ‘off’ state . d , Probability distributions of end - to - end terminal distances for ABS and Lifeact pep0 - pep9 ( see bottom ) with varying interdomain residue lengths from a worm - like chain ( WLC ) model ( top ) .
