Passive diffusion accounts for the majority of intracellular vesicle transport Méghane Sittewelle 1 and Stephen J . Royle 1 , (cid:0) 1 Centre for Mechanochemical Cell Biology and Division of Biomedical Sciences , Warwick Medical School , University of Warwick , Coventry , UK During membrane trafficking , a vesicle formed at the donor compartment must travel to the accep - tor membrane before fusing . For large carriers , it is established that this transport is motor - driven ; however , the mode by which small vesicles , which outnumber larger carriers , are transported is poorly characterized . Here we show that intracellular nanovesicles ( INVs ) , a substantial class of small vesicles , are highly mobile within cells and that this mobility depends almost entirely on passive diffu - sion ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 3 µm 2 s −1 ) . Using single particle track - ing , we describe how other small trafficking vesi - cles have a similar diffusive mode of transport , that contrasts with the motor - dependent movement of larger endolysosomal carriers . We also demon - strate that a subset of INVs are involved in consti - tutive secretion and that delivery of cargo to the plasma membrane during exocytosis is decreased when diffusion of INVs is specifically restricted . Our results suggest that passive diffusion is sufficient to explain the majority of small vesicle transport . transport vesicle | mobility | diffusion | exocytosis | membrane traffic Correspondence : s . j . royle @ warwick . ac . uk Introduction Trafficking of proteins , lipids and other molecules be - tween cellular compartments is carried out by vesicular carriers . Material destined for transfer is packaged into a small trafficking vesicle at the donor compartment ; the vesicle must then travel to its destination , before fus - ing with the target compartment to deliver the mate - rial ( Bonifacino and Glick , 2004 ) . The textbook view of vesicle transport , informed by work on positioning of or - ganelles and large vesicles , stipulates that this transport is active , occurring via motors and using the cytoskeletal network that constitutes the highways of the cell ( Vale , 2003 ) . Exactly how small vesicles , which make up the majority of membrane trafficking events , reach their tar - get compartment , is unclear . Several classes of vesicles have been described in cells . Well - characterized examples include clathrin - coated vesicles ( 50 – 100 nm diameter ) formed at the plasma membrane ( PM ) or trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) , COPII - coated ( 60 – 70 nm ) or COPI - coated vesicles ( 50 – 60 nm ) originating at the ER or Golgi , and intra - Golgi transport vesicles ( 70 – 90 nm ) ( Vigers et al . , 1986 ; Balch et al . , 1994 ; Orci et al . , 2000 ; Bykov et al . , 2017 ) . In addition , there is a very large number of uncoated vesicles inside cells that cannot be so easily catego - rized . For example , intracellular nanovesicles ( INVs , ∼ 30nm diameter ) are a large , diverse class of vesicles on the anterograde and recycling pathways ( Larocque and Royle , 2022 ) . Collectively , INVs have a broad range of Rab GTPases and R - SNAREs indicating that they are formed from a variety of donor compartments and travel to a host of different destinations ( Larocque et al . , 2020 ) . It is well established that endolysosomal organelles and tubules are moved around the cell using microtubule motors for long - range transport and the actomyosin system for short range movements ( Jongsma et al . , 2023 ; Bonifacino and Neefjes , 2017 ; S Mogre et al . , 2020 ) . For example , Rab5 - positive endosomes can un - dergo linear , micron - scale , directed motions . With the majority of motions being dynein - driven with speeds of 1 – 2 µm s −1 ( Flores - Rodriguez et al . , 2011 ) . How - ever , these membranous entities are large , ranging from 100 nm to 1 µm in size . For smaller carriers , it is unclear if their transport absolutely depends on motors . In the case of INVs , where the vesicle itself is only a little larger in diameter than that of a single microtubule ( 25 nm ) and the population of vesicles is so large , it seems unlikely that the cell’s energy budget for transport is used up in this way . We set out to describe how INVs are transported in the cell . We found that passive diffusion dominates the mo - bility of this vesicle class and that motor - based trans - port accounts for only a minority of motions . This mobil - ity profile , which contrasts with that of larger carriers , is shared by a variety of small trafficking vesicles that we tested . We also show how diffusion of INVs is impor - tant for delivery of cargo to the target membrane , during constitutive exocytosis . Results Rapid capture of vesicles at mitochondria suggests INVs are highly mobile Previously , we showed that it is possible to capture INVs at the surface of mitochondria using an inducible heterodimerization system ( Figure 1A ) . Relocalization of mCherry - FKBP - TPD54 to MitoTrap at the mitochon - dria causes the capture of INVs from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria surface ( Larocque et al . , 2020 , 2021 ) . Upon induction , the relocalization of fluorescence to Sittewelle | | May 10 , 2023 | 1 – 21 the mitochondria is rapid ( τ = 38 . 6s ) ( Figure 1B , C ) . To compare the relocation of vesicles with the relo - calization of a protein that has similar properties , we used a TPD54 mutant ( R159E ) that cannot bind INVs ( Larocque et al . , 2021 ) . This construct , mCherry - FKBP - TPD54 ( R159E ) , was relocalized an order of magnitude more quickly ( τ = 3 . 8s ) consistent with a freely diffusing protein ( dimeric mass 128 kDa ) . Induced relocalization is not an active process . That is , mitochondria do not “attract” FKBP - tagged proteins from far away ; instead , relocalization occurs through chance collisions between the vesicles and the mitochondria Therefore , these ex - periments suggest that INVs have a high mobility inside cells , but that their mobility is slower than a freely dif - fusing protein . The mobility is such that all INVs in the cell can be captured at the mitochondria in just over a minute . Besides vesicle mobility , the other factor in relocaliza - tion efficiency is the abundance and spatial distribution of the MitoTrap . To quantify the median distance that an INV may need to traverse in order to collide with a mi - tochondrial surface , we generated a 3D distance map from MitoTrap positive structures in a cell . This analy - sis revealed a distance of 1 . 1 ± 0 . 2 µm ( mean ± sd , Fig - ure 1D , E ) . This means that when we add rapamycin , a vesicle is on average ∼ 1 . 1 µ m away from a mitochon - drial surface and is captured with a T 1 / 2 = 26 . 6s . Us - ing these measurements , we can estimate an appar - ent diffusion coefficient of ∼ 0 . 3 µ m 2 s − 1 for INVs . This rough calculation suggests that INVs collectively have high motility , regardless of their mode of transport . Direct imaging of INVs reveals heterogeneous , but mainly diffusive , movement To begin to understand the mobility of INVs , we used fast capture imaging of GFP - TPD54 knock - in cells . By eye , three states of motion were evident . First , the ma - jority of vesicles underwent a random , Brownian mo - tion ( Figure 2A , B ) . Second , there were a small num - ber of immobile vesicles , likely attached to a larger sub - cellular structure . Third , another minority of vesicles underwent directed movement . Vesicles could switch between these states over time and were otherwise in - distinguishable in terms of size or brightness . Simulta - neous imaging of microtubules and INVs revealed that the directed motions likely correspond to motor - based transport along microtubules ( Figure 2C and Supple - mentary Video SV4 ) . Using single particle tracking , we could identify directed motions and found that they constituted 5 – 11 % of tracks ( Figure 2D , E ) . These di - rected motions could be reduced by depolymerizing mi - crotubules using nocodazole ( 20 µ M ) but not by actin depolymerization using Latrunculin B ( 1 µ M ) , confirm - ing that they represent microtubule - dependent transport ( Figure 2D , E , Supplementary Video SV5 ) . However , the size of this microtubule - dependent fraction of INVs mo - tions is too small to account for transport of INV cargo . Diffusion of INVs dominates recovery after photo - bleaching To further investigate INV mobility , we used fluores - cence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) . In GFP - TPD54 knock - in cells , almost all of the TPD54 is asso - ciated with INVs and the association is tight ( Larocque et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore the bleach of GFP - TPD54 and subsequent recovery of signal in the bleached region is an indirect readout of INV mobility ( Figure 3A ) . The re - covery of GFP - TPD54 was with τ = 12 . 7s whereas re - covery of GFP or GFP - TPD54 R159E mutant that is not associated with INVs was τ = 0 . 5s or 1 . 0s , respectively ( Figure 3B ) . The order of magnitude difference in recov - ery mirrors the observations made by relocalization ex - periments ( Figure 1 ) and , together with the observation of high mobility ( Figure 2 ) suggest that recovery reflects INV movement rather than exchange of protein on the surface of stationary INVs . To estimate the contribution of diffusion to INV mobil - ity , we used osmotic compression of cells . Addition of PEG1450 at up to 25 % is a reversible manipula - tion to decrease cellular volume by water exchange and thereby limit diffusion due to a crowding effect ( Guo et al . , 2017 ) . Compression of cells using 6 % or 12 % PEG1450 resulted in a slowing of GFP - TPD54 FRAP to τ = 23 . 8s or 24 . 1 s and an increase in the immobile frac - tion from ∼ 20 % to ∼ 45 – 60 % ( Figure S1 ) . GFP - TPD54 R159E diffusion was also slowed to τ = 2 . 0s or 4 . 9 s ( Figure 3C , D ) . This manipulation was reversible ( Figure S1D ) and supports the idea that mobility is mainly via diffusion . To assess the contribution of active transport to INV mo - bility , we performed two manipulations . First , nocoda - zole ( 20 µ M for > 1h ) was used to depolymerize the mi - crotubule network . FRAP of GFP - TPD54 in these cells was indistinguishable from control conditions ( τ = 9 . 4s control , 9 . 0 s nocodazole ; Figure 3E , F ) . Second , ATP depletion ( see Materials and Methods ) was used to in - hibit motor activity ( Supplementary Video SV5 ) . Again , FRAP of GFP - TPD54 was indistinguishable from con - trol τ = 9 . 2s control , 9 . 0 s ATP depletion ; Figure 3G , H ) The lack of effect of either manipulation suggests that diffusion of INVs dominates the recovery of GFP - TPD54 signal after photobleaching and points to diffusion rather than active transport as being the main mode of INV mobility . Diffusion coefficient of INVs Given the mobility of INVs is mainly diffusive , can we determine the diffusion coefficient for this vesicle class ? The FRAP experiments allow us to infer that GFP - TPD54 associated with INVs has a diffusion coefficient of 0 . 220 ± 0 . 096 µm 2 s −1 ( Figure 4A ) . By contrast , the R159E mutant of TPD54 which doesn’t bind INVs has an inferred diffusion coefficient of 2 . 20 ± 0 . 62 µm 2 s −1 . These values correspond reasonably well to our initial estimate based on the induced relocalization experi - ments ( diffusion coefficients are summarized in Figure Sittewelle | Diffusive vesicle transport | 2 Figure 1 .

To verify these measurements , we used two further approaches . First , fluorescence loss in photobleaching ( FLIP ) . While FRAP assesses the diffusion coefficient of local INVs , FLIP experiments allow us to evaluate the mobility of the whole cellular vesicle content . Here GFP - TPD54 knock - in HeLa cells , grown on micropatterns to stan - dardize the procedure were subjected to repeated pho - tobleaching and the loss of cellular fluorescence was measured ( Figure 4C and Supplementary Video SV6 ) . Using a small target region of the cell ( 3 . 2 % of the total area ) , the total cellular signal was bleached in ∼ 15min using pulses every 3 s ( τ = 430s , Figure 4C , D ) . This re - sult underscores the high mobility of INVs , because it suggests that every INV in the cell had passed through this small bleaching area in ∼ 15min . To derive a diffu - sion coefficient from these data , we used a computer simulation and asked what coefficient could describe these observations . Using pulses of 60 ms , with the same interval of repeated photobleaching ( see Materi - als and Methods , Figure 4E ) , the simulations suggested D ≈ 0 . 32 µ m 2 s − 1 . Second , we returned to single particle tracking to di - rectly analyze the movement of individual vesicles . This is a significant technical challenge . Acquisition must be fast enough to capture the motions accurately , in GFP - TPD54 knock - in cells , the signal - to - noise was very low at high frame rates . A more significant issue was the sheer density of INVs ( estimated 20 000 per cell ) which reduces the accuracy of tracking especially if they move at high speed and in a non - directed manner ( Supple - mentary Figure S3A ) . To track these vesicles accurately , we bleached StayGold - TPD54 in a subregion of the cell and then tracked INVs entering this blank region ( Sup - plementary Figure S3B - E ; Supplementary Video SV7 ) . Again , the tracked vesicles mainly moved by random diffusion ( Figure 4F ) . The diffusion coefficient derived from the mean squared displacement of all tracks was 0 . 104 µm 2 s −1 ( Figure 4G ) . Single track analysis shows that the population follows normal diffusion where the median MSD exponent α = 0 . 97 ( Figure 4H ) . The diffu - sion coefficients measured or inferred in all experiments are summarized in Figure 4B and suggest that INV mo - tion is mainly diffusive with a D of 0 . 1 – 0 . 3 µm 2 s −1 . Small trafficking vesicles move by diffusion To characterize the movement of INVs and compare this with the mobility of other vesicle types , we again used a fast capture imaging and single particle track - ing approach . Tracking was done with cells express - ing different vesicular markers ( GFP - SCAMP3 , ATG9A - GFP , GFP - Rab30 , StayGold - TPD54 , mCherry - Rab11 , GFP - 2xML1N , GFP - SCAMP1 , GFP - Clathin light chain a , GFP - Rab35 ) , markers of endosomes and lysosomes ( GFP - Rab5 , LAMP1 - mCherry - FRB ) , or a microtubule plus - end protein as a control for directed movement ( mNeonGreen - EB3 ) ( Figure 5 ) . The density of small vesicles was much higher ( 1 . 9 to 3 . 2 vesicles µm −2 ) than that of endosomes , lysosomes , and MT plus - ends ( Figure 5A , B ) . INVs marked by TPD54 were the most numerous of all those we imaged ( 5 . 4 vesi - cles µm −2 after photobleaching to reduce the density ) . The motion of all vesicles types was heterogeneous , with three states of movement and switching between Sittewelle | Diffusive vesicle transport | 4 Figure 3 .

A broken line is overlaid to show a single exponential fit ( τ in seconds is indicated ) . these states , as previously described for INVs ( Fig - ure 2 ) . We analyzed single particle tracking data us - ing a custom - written R package , TrackMateR ( Royle , 2022 ) . This allowed us to measure several parame - ters that collectively describe the motion of each vesi - cle track during the imaging period ( Figure 5B - F ) . We used a dimension - reduction method , principal compo - nent analysis ( PCA ) , to compute and visualize a mo - bility profile for each vesicle type , using these parame - ters for each track ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) . Plotting all track data on the two principal component axes al - lowed us to see the shape of the data for each marker ( Figure 5F ) . The similarity of these data shapes could be assessed using a distance - based method ( see Ma - terials and Methods ) . Subsequent hierarchical cluster - ing revealed that the markers could be grouped into three classes based upon their motion ( Figure 5G ) . The purely directed motion of EB3 – corresponding to the growth rate of microtubules – placed it clearly in a third category . The endosomal and lysosomal markers Rab5 and LAMP1 were most similar to EB3 , having a mainly directed motion . The remaining vesicle markers were in one robust class containing Rab35 , Clathrin , SCAMP1 , TPD54 , SCAMP3 , Rab30 , ATG9A , Rab11 and ML1N ( Figure 5G ) . The motion of these vesicles was mainly diffusive , with an MSD exponent α ≈ 1 ( Figure 5D , E ) . This class was distinct and robust when the clustering was repeated with subsampling of the data . To sum - marize , small trafficking vesicles ( which include INVs and clathrin - coated vesicles ) are numerous and mainly move by normal diffusion . Conversely , larger objects which are lower abundance have a higher fraction of directed motion which is consistent with microtubule - based transport . Some INVs are constitutively exocytosed In order to understand how diffusion of INVs is related to vesicle transport , we need to be able to assay the deliv - ery of INV cargo at its target compartment . Since INVs are involved in anterograde transport and receptor re - cycling ( Larocque et al . , 2020 , 2021 ) , we reasoned that we should be able to assay the delivery of INV cargo at the plasma membrane . We used synaptophysin - pHluorin ( sypHy ) as a cargo molecule and assayed de - livery by direct visualization of fusion using either TIRF microscopy of spinning disk confocal microscopy ( see Sittewelle | Diffusive vesicle transport | 5 Figure 4 .

Bright flashes corresponding to exocytic events could be imaged , occurring with a frequency of ∼ 0 . 5 µ m − 2 min − 1 ( Figure 6A ) . We con - firmed that sypHy was trafficked in INVs by performing a co - relocation experiment . Here , INVs were captured on the mitochondria by the induced relocalisation of mCherry - FKBP - TPD54 , and the co - relocation of sypHy was confirmed in the green channel ( Figure 6B ) . The co - relocation was even more obvious when the pHlu - orin was unquenched with 50 m M NH 4 Cl , which sug - gests that the INVs carrying sypHy are acidified . No co - relocation of sypHy was observed when mCherry - FKBP - TPD54 R159E mutant was relocalized to the mi - tochondria , confirming that the co - relocation was spe - cific to INVs ( Figure 6B ) . In order to confirm that the exocytic carriers that deliver sypHy to the plasma membrane are indeed INVs , we measured the exocytic frequency of sypHy before and after the capture of INVs are the mitochondria ( Figure 6C ) . To do this we co - expressed sypHy with blue Mito - Trap and either mCherry - FKBP - TPD54 WT or mCherry - FKBP as a control .

Diffusion is important for constitutive exocytosis of INVs Having confirmed that we could assay the delivery of INVs at a target compartment , we wanted to test if diffu - sion of INVs was important for delivery . We initially used osmotic compression induced by incubating cells in a solution containing 12 % PEG1450 . Under these condi - tions , we saw a dramatic reduction in the rate of sypHy exocytosis compared to control conditions , suggesting that diffusion is important for vesicles to deliver their cargo ( Figure 7A ) . However , it is likely that osmotic com - pression affects other forms of transport besides diffu - sive movement . In order to specifically slow the diffu - sion of INVs , we used a large ( estimated 14 nm ) protein “dongle” ( Küey et al . , 2019 ) to increase the effective size of INVs ( Figure 7B ) . We reasoned that in GFP - TPD54 knock - in cells , expression of a GFP nanobody coupled to three copies of FKBP would bind GFP - TPD54 , dec - orating the surface of INVs to generate “furry” vesicles . Because diffusion is related to the size of the particle , an artificial increase in size will slow diffusion . We calcu - lated that an INV with an effective diameter of 36 nm has a theoretical diffusion coefficient of 0 . 29 µm s −2 whereas an INV decorated with dongles is predicted to have a 64 nm diameter , resulting in a 0 . 16 µm s −2 diffusion co - efficient ( see Materials and Methods , Figure 7C ) . We first confirmed that diffusion of furry vesicles was slowed compared to regular INVs by performing FRAP measurements on endogenous GFP - TPD54 . The mea - sured diffusion coefficient reduced from 0 . 24 µm s −2 in control to 0 . 18 µm s −2 in cells where the dongle was expressed ( Figure 7D ) . Using the curve in Figure 7C , these measured diffusion coefficients correspond to di - ameters of 44 . 0 nm and 56 . 4 nm for the INV and the INV plus dongle , respectively . Under these conditions , we next analyzed the rate of sypHy exocytosis and ob - served an approximately 50 % decrease in cells ex - pressing the dongle compared to the control ( Figure 7E , F ) . Together these experiments confirm that diffu - sion is an important mode of transport for delivery of cargo at the target compartment . Discussion Vesicle traffic is a cellular solution to the problem of how to selectively transfer material between compart - ments , without each compartment losing its identity . Here , we investigated how vesicles move between com - partments . The textbook view of vesicle transport is that it is motor - dependent . We find instead that small vesicles do not rely on motor - based transport and that their high mobility is predominantly via normal diffusion . We showed that this diffusion is sufficient to explain the transport of INVs to a target compartment , the plasma membrane , during constitutive exocytosis . One strong concept in membrane traffic is that a vesi - cle must move “from A to B” and this is usually taken to mean from “point A to point B” . Obviously , a vesi - cle emerges at a specific point and fuses at a single place ; therefore a random diffusion model for transport appears woefully inadequate to fulfill this function . How - ever , the goal of membrane traffic is to transfer ma - terial from identity A to identity B . Identity B can be large expanse like the plasma membrane or it could be present intracellularly as multiple copies of compart - ment B . Now , we can see that random diffusion per - forms well ; as long as the diffusion coefficient is not too low and the proximity to the target compartment is high . For small vesicles in compact cells both of these con - ditions are met . In larger cells , or polarized cells such as neurons , different transport paradigms are in place ( Drechsler et al . , 2017 ; Goldstein and van de Meent , 2015 ; Maday et al . , 2014 ) , but even here local trans - port between proximal compartments is likely also to be via normal diffusion . One major finding of our work is that the diffusion coefficient of small vesicles is high . Measurements on INVs ( corroborated with four differ - ent methods ) suggests D is 0 . 1 – 0 . 3 µm 2 s −1 and single particle tracking suggests other vesicle types have sim - ilarly high coefficients , supported by the work of others ( Zhao and Keen , 2008 ; Broadbent et al . , 2023 ) . Previ - ous attempts to model vesicle traffic have favored active transport over normal diffusion ( Klann et al . , 2012 ) , but it seems that the diffusion coefficient was likely under - estimated because values consistent with large carriers and organelles were used . The vesicle transport model we propose suggests two further concepts for membrane traffic . First , there may be redundancy built in to small vesicle transport be - cause there are many small vesicles , rather than one large carrier , transferring cargo from compartment A to compartment B . If cargo is distributed among the vesi - cles , the consequence of a single failure is minimised . Second , traffic is likely probablistic . We saw that for a distributed compartment like the mitochondria , when INVs were induced to dock there , delivery of all INVs in the cell could occur in about one minute . In nor - mal membrane traffic , each vesicle and target mem - brane must be compatible in order to fuse ( Jahn and Scheller , 2006 ) . Passive diffusion allows for small vesi - cles to sample multiple compartments before finding the cognate machinery for fusion , suggesting a probabilis - tic element to cargo delivery . This final delivery process is known to be assisted by tethers and other machin - ery which biases the fusion of compatible vesicles ( Shin et al . , 2020 ; Szentgyörgyi and Spang , 2023 ; Maib and Murray , 2022 ) . To test the idea that diffusion was required for vesicle transport we used a method to decrease the diffusion of INVs specifically and observed a decrease in deliv - ery at the target membrane ( exocytosis ) . It is possi - Sittewelle | Diffusive vesicle transport | 9 ble that this result is due to the dongle method inter - fering with exocytosis itself . However , we found that in both the control and in the dongle condition , the vesi - cles fuse immediately after approach . We saw no evi - dence that vesicles approached the plasma membrane but did not fuse , suggesting that the decrease in rate simply reflects a decrease in vesicle transport . A sec - ond interpretation could be that motor - based transport for INVs is actually what delivers the vesicle for exo - cytosis , and diffusion is simply what the vesicle does when it is not being actively transported . There are three reasons why this is very unlikely . First , even with such a large number of INVs , the directed events are probably too small a fraction to fully account for the exocytic rates observed , especially when we consider that not all INVs are destined for exocytosis , based on their Rab profile ( Larocque et al . , 2020 ) . Second , the restriction on INV diffusion that we imposed resulted in a decrease in exocytic rate ( ∼ 38 % ) which is larger than the fraction of INVs that show directed movement ( 5 – 11 % ) . Third , if diffusion was simply a precursor to functional , motor - based transport , then the modest re - striction we imposed is unlikely to alter the number of vesicles supplied to motor - based transport , as the prox - imity to microtubules is generally high , and the supply of motors to a vesicle is based on freely diffusing protein , which is faster than INV diffusion . In fact , the Rab5 - or Rab7 - positive carriers have much more restricted diffu - sion suggesting that our imposed restriction of diffusion of INVs should have increased motor - based transport if anything . Rather than membrane traffic being under any kind of master control – deciding where the energy budget is best deployed – we think that the trafficking behaviors we have described emerge from the physical proper - ties of the components involved . Diffusion is the de - fault state if a vesicle is not transported or tethered , and small vesicles diffuse faster than larger ones . Rather than this meaning that the larger ones need more as - sistance from the transport network , we wonder if their slow diffusion allows them to engage with the motors necessary to traverse the cytoskeletal network . Con - versely , fast diffusion of small vesicles may generally preclude active transport . While active transport and tethering ( or slow diffusion ) allow a concentration of ob - jects to a certain area , the fast diffusion of INVs will maximize exploration of the cell volume and probabilis - tic encounter with identity B . Methods Molecular biology The following plasmids were available from previ - ous work : GFP - FKBP - TPD54 WT and R159E mutant ( Larocque et al . , 2021 ) , synaptophysin - pHluorin / sypHy ( Granseth et al . , 2006 ) , mCherry - MitoTrap ( Cheese - man et al . , 2013 ) , LAMP1 - mCherry - FRB ( Küey et al . , 2022 ) , GFP - Rab35 , GFP - Rab30 , mCherry - FKBP - Rab11a ( Larocque et al . , 2020 ) and GFP - clathrin light chain A ( Royle et al . , 2005 ) . StayGold - TPD54 was made by DNA synthesis ( Twist Bioscience ) using Stay - Gold N1 / C4 as the tag ( Hirano et al . , 2022 ) . GFP - SCAMP1 and GFP - SCAMP3 were cloned by PCR and insertion into BglII and SalI sites in pEGFP - C1 . ATG9A - GFP was cloned by amplifying human ATG9A ( gift from Sharon Tooze ) by PCR to SalI and EcoRI sites , remove the stop codon and insert into pFKBP - EGFP - N1 be - fore moving the insert to pEGFP - N1 using the same sites . Plasmids mCherry - Rab5a ( # 2769 ) , pEBFP2 - N1 ( # 54595 ) , GFP - 2xML1N ( # 67797 ) or mNeonGreen - EB3 - 7 were from Addgene or Allele Biotech . Blue Mito - Trap ( pMito - eBFP2 - FRB ) , was cloned by cutting eBFP2 from pEBFP2 - N1 and inserting in place of mCherry in pMito - mCherry - FRB using AgeI and BsrGI sites . Cell biology Wild - type HeLa cells ( HPA / ECACC 93021013 ) or GFP - TPD54 knock - in ( clone 35 ) HeLa cells ( Larocque et al . , 2020 ) were maintained in DMEM with Gluta - MAX ( Thermo Fisher ) supplemented with 10 % FBS , and 100 U mL −1 penicillin / streptomycin . RPE1 cells stably expressing EB3 - tdTomato ( kind gift from Anne Straube , Warwick ) , were cultured in DMEM / Nutrient Mixture F - 12 Ham ( Sigma ) supplemented with 10 % FBS , and 100 U mL −1 penicillin / streptomycin , 2 m M L - Glutamine and 0 . 25 % Sodium bicarbonate ( Sigma ) ; supplemented with 500 µg mL −1 G418 . All cells were kept in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 ; and were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamina - tion by a PCR - based method . Cells were transfected with GeneJuice ( Merck ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Relocalization of FKBP - tagged TPD54 to MitoTrap was induced by application of rapamycin ( Alfa Aesar ) at a final concentration of 200 n M , as described previously ( Larocque et al . , 2020 ) . For microtubule depolymer - ization , cells were treated with 20 µ M nocodazole for at least 1 h . For actin depolymerization , cells were treated with 1 µ M Latrunculin B ( Merck ) for 25 min . For ATP depletion experiments , cells in full me - dia were washed twice with PBS , then cultured in DMEM glucose - free ( Gibco 11966 - 025 ) supplemented with 10 % FBS , and 100 U mL −1 penicillin / streptomycin , 6 m M of 2 - deoxyglucose ( Apexbio ) and 10 m M of sodium azide ( G - Biosciences ) for 1 h . The efficiency of deple - tion was assayed by measuring intracellular ATP lev - els using Luminescent ATP Detection Assay Kit ( Abcam ab113849 ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Osmotic compression was applied by exchanging full culture medium with full media supplemented with various concentrations of PEG 1450 ( Sigma P7306 ) . Washout of PEG 1450 was done by progressive and successive dilutions until the medium was completely changed , to avoid osmotic shock by immediate replace - ment . Where cells were grown on micropatterns , a total of Sittewelle | Diffusive vesicle transport | 10 27 000 Hela cells were seeded onto micropatterned chips ( CYTOO chips™ Standard ; CYTOO Inc . , Greno - ble , France ) and incubated for 1 h . As cells began to at - tach to the micropatterns , the medium was changed to remove all non - attached cells and then returned to the incubator to complete attachment . Later the same day , cells were either imaged live or fixed for immunofluores - cence ; only micropatterns containing a single cell were analyzed . Here , cells were fixed at room temperature with PFA solution ( 3 % formaldehyde and 4 % sucrose in PBS ) for 15 min and permeabilized at room temper - ature in 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS ( or 0 . 1 % saponin in PBS ) for 10 min , followed by blocking with 3 % BSA in PBS for 1 h . To amplify GFP signal , cells were incubated with GFP - booster ( Alexa Fluor 488 , 1 : 200 ; Invitrogen ) . After three PBS washes , coverslips were mounted with Mowiol solution DAPI . To visualize the cytoskeleton , microtubules were stained in live cells using 0 . 5 µ M of SiR - Tubulin ( Spirochrome ) . Microscopy For live cell imaging , cells were plated onto fluorodishes ( WPI ) and imaged in complete media in an incubated chamber at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . All live cell imaging was done using a Nikon CSU - W1 spinning disc con - focal system with SoRa upgrade ( Yokogawa ) with a Nikon 100× 1 . 49 NA oil CFI SR HP Apo TIRF objec - tive with optional 2 . 8× intermediate magnification and 95B Prime camera ( Photometrics ) . This system has a CSU - W1 ( Yokogawa ) spinning disk unit with 50 µm and SoRa disks ( SoRa disk used ) , Nikon Perfect Fo - cus autofocus , Okolab microscope incubator , Nikon mo - torized xy stage and Nikon 200 µm z - piezo . Excitation was via 405 nm , 488 nm , 561 nm and 638 nm lasers with 405 / 488 / 561 / 640 nm dichroic and Blue , 446 / 60 ; Green , 525 / 50 ; Red , 600 / 52 ; FRed , 708 / 75 emission filters . Acquisition and image capture was via NiS Elements ( Nikon ) . For fast imaging to analyze vesicle movement , images were typically acquired every 60 ms . Exposure time was limited so a high laser power was used ( ∼ 80 % ) and movies were limited by photobleaching . StayGold imaging allowed a lower laser power ∼ 40 % and longer movie acquisition . To image exocytosis , early experiments used a Nikon TIRF microscope system , although we found that imag - ing the ventral plane of the cell with the spinning disc system gave similar results . Images were acquired every 200 ms , which was sufficient to see events and spread of sypHy in the plasma membrane . For experi - ments where exocytosis was imaged in clone 35 cells , we found that the increase in fluorescence from sypHy fusion and dequenching was easily distinguishable from GFP - TPD54 in the background . For experiments where pHluorin was fully dequenched , a solution containing 50 m M NH 4 Cl was added to the cells . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) and fluorescence loss in photobleaching ( FLIP ) exper - iments were controlled by NiS Elements . Photobleach - ing was performed via C - TIRF 405 C200812 Chroma filter . A circular region of interest ( ROI ) of 4 µm or 6 µm was defined for FRAP or FLIP respectively , and 100 % laser power , 40 µs dwell time were empirically determined to bleach the GFP - or Staygold - tagged con - structs . The effective size of the bleached region was confirmed by bleaching a fixed cell and measuring the bleached area . For FRAP experiments , images were taken with low laser power to limit photobleaching , within the same focal plane at regular intervals ( between 80 ms and 1 s ) to monitor fluorescence recovery in the ROI . For FLIP experiments on GFP - TPD54 , regular ( ev - ery 3 s ) sequential bleaching was done with continual image acquisition . Data analysis Generally , images were analyzed in Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) using custom scripts and the outputs were processed and plotted using R . For quantification of TPD54 relocalization , we used a custom - written ImageJ script . Briefly , mitochondria were segmented using LabKit and used as a mask to quantify the mean pixel density in the TPD54 channel in each frame after back - ground subtraction . Data were averaged and fitted with a single exponential function as described below . Equiv - alent results were obtained with GFP - FKBP tags rather than mCherry - FKBP , and with a C - terminally tagged WT rather than an N - terminally tagged construct . Mean pixel densities of the FRAP / FLIP region were measured for each cell , background - subtracted and then normalized to the pre - bleach point . In R , the aver - age relative intensity was used for fitting using the equa - tion , y 0 + Aexpx − x 0 τ ( 1 ) with the reciprocal of the standard deviation of each time point used for weighting ( FRAP only ) . The diffusion co - efficients from FRAP experiments were calculated us - ing the corrected the Soumpasis equation ( Kang et al . , 2012 ) , D = r 2 e + r 2 n 8 τ 1 / 2 ( 2 ) where r e is the effective post - bleach radius and r n is the user - defined radius , both in µm ; and τ 1 / 2 is the half time determined on the recovery curves in seconds . To calculate mitochondrial proximity , cells and mito - chondria were each segmented by two LabKit classi - fiers using the TPD54 and MitoTrap channels , respec - tively . A distance map from mitochondria ( within the cell of interest ) was generated using the 3D suite ImageJ ( Ollion et al . , 2013 ) . Voxel 3D distances for the entire cell volume ( excluding mitochondria ) were imported into R and the median distance was calculated for each cell . All single particle tracking was done using TrackMate v7 . 10 . 2 ( Tinevez et al . , 2017 ) . The outputs were an - Sittewelle | Diffusive vesicle transport | 11 alyzed using the R package TrackMateR , which was written specifically for this project ( Royle , 2022 ) . To identify directed transport of vesicles , TraJClassifier was used ( Wagner et al . , 2017 ) . Tracks classified by TraJ as “directed” contained significant diffusive motion so , we pooled all tracks not classified as directed and mea - sured their efficiency ( related to linearity of track ) . The upper limit for the experiment was then used to iden - tify tracks that were moving in a truly directed man - ner . Track parameters assessed by TrackMateR were used in the principal component analysis . The individual points on PC2 vs PC1 were used to generate a contour map which is a 3D shape that describes the population of tracks for each marker in principal component space . For hierarchical clustering , a dissimilarity matrix was as - sembled from pairwise comparisons ( total distance ) of these 3D shapes in IGOR Pro . To quantify exocytosis , we constructed a simple au - tomated detection procedure . All movie frames were projected onto a single image and Find Maxima in Fiji was used to center ROIs in order to measure intensity over time in the movie . These outputs were read into R , normalized and then a peakfinding procedure was used to find peaks ( exocytic events ) and thereby cal - culate number of events per unit area per unit time . A manual method was also used following an automated blinding procedure . Here exocytic events were checked manually to ensure that they represented true exocytic events . Theory and simulations To estimate diffusion of an INV or an INV decorated with dongles , we used the Stokes – Einstein equation , D = k B T 6 πηr ( 3 ) where k B is the Boltzmann constant , T is temperature , η is the cytoplasmic viscosity , taken as 4 . 4 × 10 −2 Pa s ( Kalwarczyk et al . , 2011 ) , and r is the radius of a spher - ical particle . To approximate the diffusion coefficient from FLIP mea - surements , a custom - written routine for IGOR Pro 9 was used . Briefly , a circular cell area of 15 µm radius was used and the bleach area set as a variable between 2 . 6 – 2 . 8 µm radius in 5 steps ( to simulate small differ - ences in the bleach area and cell footprint ) . 100 vesi - cles were simulated to diffuse with their positions cap - tured at 60 ms intervals , and a bleach pattern of 60 ms bleach every 3 s used to match the experiments . Any vesicles that fell inside the bleach region while the laser was simulated as on were inactivated . The half - time of inactivation was found by averaging 10 simulations at defined D and bleach radius . This simple simulation as - sumes that the number of vesicles in the cell is constant ( no new vesicles are made and no vesicles fuse during the simulation period ) . To assess the ability of TrackMate to accurately track high density , high mobility vesicles at different frame rates , a simulation was used in Fiji where vesicles were “imaged” in a simulated confocal plane as they diffused through a 14 × 14 × 14 µ m volume . The resulting im - ages from these simulations were automatically tracked by TrackMate using identical settings to detect the spots and the outputs analyzed by TrackMateR . The ground truth locations of spots outputted by Fiji were used to verify the mobility of simulated vesicles .

Sittewelle | Diffusive vesicle transport Supplementary Information | 15 Figure S3 . Tracking diffusing particles is compromised at high particle densities . ( A ) Results of a simulation where the indicated number of INV - sized particles were diffusing with known D in a 3D space and captured in a confocal plane . Simulated images were captured at 10ms , 60ms , 100ms intervals and then particles were tracked using TrackMate ( v7 . 10 . 2 ) . At 60ms , the frame rate used in this study , tracking is close to the ground truth value at D < 0 . 1 and degrades for particles with higher coefficients . Higher densities lead to greater underestimation as tracks become mislinked due to particle density . Slower frame rate capture leads to consistent underestimation of D . ( B - E ) Bleaching of StayGold - TPD54 to reduce the number of INVs to be tracked leads to more accurate estimation of D . ( B ) Stills from a region of a cell expressing StayGold - TPD54 before ( pre ) and after ( post ) bleach . ( C ) Tracking in such regions leads to a decrease in the number of particles to track . Median track density is the number of neighboring tracks in a 1µm radius circle . So “pre” equates to 5 . 57 vesicles and “post” to 2 . 55 vesicles µm −2 . These densities translate to respective values of 16982 and 7774 vesicles for the simulation shown in A . ( D ) Diffusion coefficient measured in the same cells pre and post bleach . ( E ) Mean squared displacement for these datasets . Sittewelle | Diffusive vesicle transport Supplementary Information | 16 Figure S4 . Principal component analysis of single particle tracking data . ( A ) All tracks from all markers represented on the two principal component axes following principal component analysis ( PCA ) . ( B ) Influence of variables on the PCA : alpha ( MSD exponent ) , neighbours ( number of neighboring tracks within a 1µm radius ) , density ( density of tracks in a unit area ) , cumdist ( cumulative distance ) , cumtime ( cumulative time ) , speed ( in µms −1 , wide ( furthest point - to - point distance in a track ) , fractal dimension ( fd ) of track . ( C ) Tracks from a equal number of randomly - selected tracks plotted on the two principal component axes to show that the shape of points in principal component space is similar regardless of sample size .
