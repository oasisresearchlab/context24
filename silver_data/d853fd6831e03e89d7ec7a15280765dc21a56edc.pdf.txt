In this paper , we first illustrate with a simple example that the I 2 statistic is heavily dependent on the study sample sizes , mainly because it is used to quantify the heterogeneity between the observed effect sizes . To reduce the influence of sample sizes , we introduce an alternative measure that aims to directly measure the heterogeneity between the study populations involved in the meta - analysis . We further propose a new estima - tor , namely the I 2A statistic , to estimate the newly defined measure of heterogeneity . For practical implementation , the exact formulas of the I 2A statistic are also derived under two common scenarios with the effect size as the mean difference ( MD ) or the standardized mean difference ( SMD ) . Simulations and real data analysis demon - strate that the I 2A statistic provides an asymptotically unbiased estimator for the absolute heterogeneity between the study populations , and it is also independent of the study sample sizes as expected . To conclude , our newly defined I 2 A statistic can be used as a supplemental measure of heterogeneity to monitor the situations where the study effect sizes are indeed similar with little biological difference . In such scenario , the fixed - effect model can be appropriate ; nevertheless , when the sample sizes are sufficiently large , the I 2 statistic may still increase to 1 and subsequently suggest the random - effects model for meta - analysis .

M E ] 25 M a r 2024 1 Introduction Meta - analysis is a statistical technique for evidence - based practice , which aims to synthe - size multiple studies and produce a summary conclusion for the whole body of research ( Egger and Smith , 1997 ) . In the literature , there are two commonly used statistical models for meta - analysis , namely , the fixed - effect model and the random - effects model . Among them , the fixed - effect model assumes that the effect sizes of different studies are all the same , which is somewhat restrictive and may not be realistic in practice . The effect sizes often differ between the studies due to variability in study design , outcome measure - ment tools , risk of bias , and the participants , interventions and outcomes studied ( Higgins et al . , 2019 ) , etc . Such diversity in the effect sizes is known as the heterogeneity . When the heterogeneity exists , the random - effects model ought to be applied for meta - analysis . In such scenarios , it is of great importance to properly quantify the heterogeneity so as to explore the generalizability of the findings from a meta - analysis . To describe the heterogeneity in detail , we first introduce the random - effects model for meta - analysis . Let k be the total number of studies , and y i be the observed effect sizes from the studies i = 1 , . . . , k . For each study with true effect size µ i , we assume that y i is normally distributed with mean µ i = E ( y i | µ i ) and variance σ 2 y i = var ( y i | µ i ) . Moreover , to account for the heterogeneity between the studies , we also assume that the individual effect sizes µ i follow another normal distribution with mean µ and variance τ 2 > 0 . Taken together , the random - effects model for meta - analysis can be expressed as y i = µ + δ i + ϵ i , δ i i . i . d . ∼ N ( 0 , τ 2 ) , ϵ i ind ∼ N ( 0 , σ 2 y i ) , ( 1 ) where “i . i . d . ” represents independent and identically distributed , “ind” represents inde - pendently distributed , τ 2 is the between - study variance , and σ 2 y i are the within - study variances . In addition , the study deviations δ i = µ i − µ and the random errors ϵ i are assumed to be independent of each other . When δ i are all zero , model ( 1 ) reduces to the fixed - effect model and there is no heterogeneity between the studies . To test the existence of heterogeneity for model ( 1 ) , Cochran ( 1954 ) proposed the Q 2 statistic as Q = (cid:80) ki = 1 w i ( y i − (cid:80) ki = 1 w i y i / (cid:80) ki = 1 w i ) 2 , where w i = 1 / σ 2 y i are the inverse - variance weights . Noting that σ 2 y i can often be estimated with high precision , it is a common practice in meta - analysis that the within - study variances are regarded as known . Nevertheless , when used as a measure of heterogeneity , it is often criticized that the value of Q will increase with the number of studies . Another measure for heterogeneity is to apply the between - study variance τ 2 , yet it is known to be specific to a particular effect metric , making it impossible to compare across different meta - analyses ( DerSimonian and Laird , 1986 ) . To have a fair comparison , Higgins and Thompson ( 2002 ) and Higgins et al . ( 2003 ) introduced the I 2 statistic by a two - step procedure , under the assumption that the within - study variances σ 2 y i = σ 2 y are all the same . They first defined the measure of heterogeneity between the studies as ICC HT = τ 2 var ( y i ) = τ 2 τ 2 + σ 2 y , ( 2 ) and then proposed I 2 = ˆ τ 2 ˆ τ 2 + ˆ σ 2 y = max (cid:26) Q − ( k − 1 ) Q , 0 (cid:27) ( 3 ) to estimate the unknown ICC HT , where ˆ τ 2 = max { { Q − ( k − 1 ) } / ( (cid:80) ki = 1 w i − (cid:80) ki = 1 w 2 i / (cid:80) ki = 1 w i ) , 0 } is the Dersimonian - Laird estimator ( DerSimonian and Laird , 1986 ) and ˆ σ 2 y = (cid:80) ki = 1 w i ( k − 1 ) / { ( (cid:80) ki = 1 w i ) 2 − (cid:80) ki = 1 w 2 i } . When the within - study variances are all the same , ˆ σ 2 y is an estimate for the common σ 2 y . Otherwise if they differ , B¨ohning et al . ( 2017 ) has showed that ˆ σ 2 y is asymptotically identical to the harmonic mean ( (cid:80) ki = 1 w i / k ) − 1 of the within - study variances . Moreover , the I 2 statistic is also guaranteed to be within the interval [ 0 , 1 ) , which is appealing in that it does not depend on the number of studies and is irrespective of the effect metric . Thanks to its nice properties , the I 2 statistic is nowadays routinely reported in the forest plots for meta - analyses , and / or used as a criterion for model selection between the fixed - effect model and the random - effects model . In Google Scholar , as of March 2024 , the two papers by Higgins and Thompson ( 2002 ) and Higgins et al . ( 2003 ) have been cited more than 30 , 000 and 52 , 000 times , respectively . Despite of its huge popularity , 3 there were evidences in the literature reporting the limitations of the I 2 statistic . In particular , R¨ucker et al . ( 2008 ) found that the I 2 statistic always increases rapidly to 1 when the sample sizes are large , regardless of whether or not the heterogeneity between the studies is clinically important . For other discussions on the I 2 statistic as a measure of heterogeneity , one may refer to , for example , Riley et al . ( 2016 ) , IntHout et al . ( 2016 ) , Borenstein et al . ( 2017 ) , Sangnawakij et al . ( 2019 ) , Holling et al . ( 2020 ) , and the references therein . This motivates us to further explore the characteristics of the I 2 statistic as a measure of heterogeneity for meta - analysis . To answer this question , we first present a motivating example to demonstrate that the I 2 statistic was defined to quantify the heterogeneity between the observed effect sizes rather than that between the study populations . In view of this , we regard the I 2 statistic as a relative measure of heterogeneity . We further draw a connection between the one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and the random - effects meta - analysis , and subsequently introduce an alternative measure for quantifying the heterogeneity in the random - effects model , which is independent of study sample sizes and can serve as an absolute measure of heterogeneity . For details , see Section 3 . 2 for the defined ICC MA in formula ( 7 ) . To move forward , the statistical properties of ICC MA are also derived to explore the distinction between our new measure and the existing measures including ICC HT . Lastly , we propose an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the unknown ICC MA , referred to as the I 2A statistic , and show by simulations and real data analysis that it is independent of the study sample sizes . The remainder of the paper is organized as follows . In Section 2 , we give a motivating example to illustrate that ICC HT heavily depends on the study sample sizes . In Section Section 3 , by drawing a close connection between ANOVA and the random - effects meta - analysis , we introduce an alternative measure for quantifying the heterogeneity between the studies . In Section 4 , we derive the I 2A statistic as an asymptotically unbiased esti - mator for the newly proposed absolute measure of heterogeneity . In Sections 5 and 6 , we provide the detailed formulas of the I 2A statistic for two common scenarios with the 4 mean difference or the standardized mean difference as the effect size . While for practi - cal implementation , real data analysis and numerical results are also presented for each scenario . Finally , we conclude the paper in Section 7 and provide the technical details in the Appendix . 2 A motivating example In this section , we illustrate how ICC HT in ( 2 ) varies along with the sample sizes , and so may not be able to serve as a measure of heterogeneity between the study populations . To confirm this claim , we first consider a motivating example of three studies with data gen - erated from normal populations N ( − 0 . 05 , 1 ) , N ( 0 , 1 ) and N ( 0 . 05 , 1 ) , respectively . From the top - left panel of Figure 1 , it is evident that the three study populations are largely overlapped . Taken the three study means as a random sample , the between - study variance can be estimated by the sample variance as ˜ τ 2 = { ( − 0 . 05 − 0 ) 2 + ( 0 − 0 ) 2 + ( 0 . 05 − 0 ) 2 } / 2 = 0 . 0025 . −3 −1 0 1 2 3 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 Population distributions −0 . 3 −0 . 1 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 2 4 6 8 Sampling distributions with n = 400 Effect size −0 . 10 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 5 10 15 20 25 Sampling distributions with n = 4000 Effect size Figure 1 : Population distributions of the three studies and the sampling distributions of the observed effect sizes . Left panel : Population distributions are N ( − 0 . 05 , 1 ) in blue , N ( 0 , 1 ) in green and N ( 0 . 05 , 1 ) in red , respectively . Middle panel : Sampling distribu - tions are N ( − 0 . 05 , 0 . 0025 ) , N ( 0 , 0 . 0025 ) and N ( 0 . 05 , 0 . 0025 ) , respectively . Right panel : Sampling distributions are N ( − 0 . 05 , 0 . 00025 ) , N ( 0 , 0 . 00025 ) and N ( 0 . 05 , 0 . 00025 ) , re - spectively . To explain why ICC HT is not a measure of heterogeneity between the study popula - tions , we consider two scenarios to meta - analyze the three studies , with the population 5 means being treated as the effect sizes . The first scenario assumes n = 400 patients in each study . By taking the sample means , the sampling distributions of the observed effect sizes are thus N ( − 0 . 05 , 0 . 0025 ) , N ( 0 , 0 . 0025 ) and N ( 0 . 05 , 0 . 0025 ) , respectively , yielding σ 2 y = 0 . 0025 as the common within - study variance . Further by the definition in ( 2 ) , we have ICC HT ≈ 0 . 0025 0 . 0025 + 0 . 0025 = 50 % . In the second scenario , we consider n = 4000 for each study . This leads to the sam - pling distributions of the observed effect sizes as N ( − 0 . 05 , 0 . 00025 ) , N ( 0 , 0 . 00025 ) and N ( 0 . 05 , 0 . 00025 ) , respectively . Further by σ 2 y = 0 . 00025 , the measure of heterogeneity is ICC HT ≈ 0 . 00025 0 . 00025 + 0 . 0025 = 90 . 9 % . Finally , for ease of comparison , we also plot the sampling distributions of the observed effect sizes in Figure 1 for the two hypothetical scenarios with varying study sample sizes . The above example clearly shows that ICC HT , defined in ( 2 ) by Higgins and Thomp - son ( 2002 ) , measures the heterogeneity between the observed effect sizes and thus heavily depends on the study sample sizes . In other words , ICC HT is a relative measure of hetero - geneity for meta - analysis . Consequently , as a sample estimate of ICC HT , the I 2 statistic is also heavily dependent on the sample sizes . This coincides with the observations by R¨ucker et al . ( 2008 ) . Specifically , in our motivating example , ICC HT increases rapidly to about 90 % when the sample sizes are 4000 , even though it is evident that the three pop - ulations are largely overlapped with each other . To summarize , when the study sample sizes n i are large enough , it will always yield an I 2 value being close to 1 . On the other hand , compared with the population variance 1 , the differences between the three study means ( − 0 . 05 , 0 , 0 . 05 ) may not be clinically important . To support this claim , we note that the Scientific Committee of the European Food Safety Authority have also empha - sized the importance of assessing the biological differences ( EFSA Scientific Committee , 2011 ) . This hence motivates us to introduce an alternative measure that quantifies the 6 heterogeneity between the study populations directly , in a way to reduce the influence of sample sizes . 3 A new measure of heterogeneity To further explore the characteristics of ICC HT , we also draw in this section an interesting connection between one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and meta - analysis . And on basis of that , a new measure for quantifying the heterogeneity between the study popu - lations will be introduced , and moreover by studying its statistical properties , it is also explained why it can add new value to meta - analysis . 3 . 1 Connection between ANOVA and meta - analysis To introduce the one - way ANOVA , we let y ij be the j th observation in the i th population , i = 1 , . . . , k and j = 1 , . . . , n i , where k is the number of studies and n i are the study sample sizes from each population . The random - effects ANOVA for the observed data is then y ij = µ + δ i + ξ ij , δ i i . i . d . ∼ N ( 0 , τ 2 ) , ξ ij i . i . d . ∼ N ( 0 , σ 2 ) , ( 4 ) where µ is the grand mean , δ i are the treatment effects , and ξ ij are the random errors . We further assume that δ i are i . i . d . normal random variables with mean 0 and variance τ 2 ≥ 0 , ξ ij are i . i . d . normal random errors with mean 0 and variance σ 2 > 0 , and that δ i and ξ ij are independent of each other . In addition , we refer to µ i = µ + δ i as the individual means , τ 2 as the between - study variance , σ 2 as the common error variance for all k populations , and τ 2 + σ 2 as the total variance of each observation . To draw a close connection between ANOVA and meta - analysis , we consider a hypo - thetical scenario in which the experimenter first computed the sample mean and its vari - ance for each population , namely y i = (cid:80) n i j = 1 y ij / n i and ˆ σ 2 y i = (cid:80) n i j = 1 ( y ij − y i ) 2 / { n i ( n i − 1 ) } for i = 1 , . . . , k , and then reported these summary data rather than the raw data to the public . In practice , there are reasons why one must do so , including , for example , due to 7 Table 1 : Connection between the ANOVA model in ( 4 ) and the meta - analysis model in ( 5 ) , where y i = (cid:80) n i j = 1 y ij / n i and ϵ i = (cid:80) n i j = 1 ξ ij / n i for i = 1 , . . . , k and j = 1 , . . . , n i . ANOVA Meta - analysis Model y ij = µ + δ i + ξ ij y i = µ + δ i + ϵ i Between - study variance τ 2 τ 2 Error ( or within - study ) variance σ 2 σ 2 / n i Total variance var ( y ij ) = τ 2 + σ 2 var ( y i ) = τ 2 + σ 2 / n i the privacy protection for which the individual patient data cannot be released . Under such a scenario , if some researchers want to re - analyze the experiment using only the publicly available data , it then yields a new random - effects model as y i = µ + δ i + ϵ i , δ i i . i . d . ∼ N ( 0 , τ 2 ) , ϵ i ind ∼ N ( 0 , σ 2 / n i ) , ( 5 ) where y i are the sample means , µ and δ i are the same as defined in model ( 4 ) , and ϵ i = (cid:80) n i j = 1 ξ ij / n i are independent random errors with mean 0 and variance σ 2 / n i , where i = 1 , . . . , k . Now from the point of view of meta - analysis , if we treat y i as the reported effect sizes and ˆ σ 2 y i as the within - study variances representing σ 2 / n i , then model ( 5 ) is essentially the same as the random - effects model in ( 1 ) . This interesting connection shows that , when the ANOVA model with raw data only releases the summary data to the public , it will then yield a meta - analysis model with summary data . For ease of comparison , we also summarize some key components in Table 1 for both the ANOVA model in ( 4 ) and the meta - analysis model in ( 5 ) . For the meta - analysis model , under the assumption that the within - study variances , i . e . σ 2 / n i , are all equal , Higgins and Thompson ( 2002 ) interpreted the measure of heterogeneity as the proportion of total variance that is “between studies” . More specifically , by the last column of Table 1 , they introduced the measure of heterogeneity for meta - analysis as in ( 2 ) , where σ 2 y = σ 2 / n i is the common within - study variance for the observed effect sizes . This clearly explains why ICC HT will be heavily dependent on the study sample sizes . When the sample sizes go to 8 infinity , the within - study variances will converge to zero so that ICC HT will increase to 1 , as having been observed in R¨ucker et al . ( 2008 ) . This also coincides with our motivating example in Section 2 that , when the sample size varies from 400 to 4000 , their measure of heterogeneity will increase from 50 % to about 90 % , regardless of whether or not the heterogeneity between the studies is clinically important . For the ANOVA model , it is well known that the intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) is the most commonly used measure of heterogeneity ( Fisher , 1925 ; Smith , 1957 ; Donner , 1979 ; McGraw and Wong , 1996 ) , which interprets the proportion of total variance that is “between populations” . More specifically , by Table 1 , ICC can be expressed as ICC = τ 2 var ( y ij ) = τ 2 τ 2 + σ 2 . ( 6 ) As shown in the hypothetical scenario , the ANOVA model in ( 4 ) and the meta - analysis model in ( 5 ) are , in fact , modeling the same populations , even though one uses the raw data and the other uses the summary data . In the special case when the mean value is taken as the effect size , it is known that the sample mean is a sufficient and complete statistic for the normal mean ; in other words , the raw data and the summary data contain exactly the same information regarding the effect size . With this insight , we expect that the measures of heterogeneity between the study populations for the two models should also be the same , regardless of whether the raw data or the summary data are being used . 3 . 2 An intrinsic measure of heterogeneity Inspired by the intrinsic connection between ANOVA and meta - analysis , we now follow the same assumption as in ANOVA that the population variances n i σ 2 y i are all equal . For ease of presentation , we also denote the common study population variance as σ 2pop . Then by following ICC in ( 6 ) for ANOVA , we propose the following measure of heterogeneity for meta - analysis : ICC MA = τ 2 var ( y ij ) = τ 2 τ 2 + σ 2pop . ( 7 ) 9 Note that the range of ICC MA is always within the interval [ 0 , 1 ) . Regarding the rationale of ICC MA for meta - analysis , one may also refer to the proposed measure in Sangnawakij et al . ( 2019 ) . To further study the properties of ICC MA and explain why it can serve as an absolute measure of heterogeneity for meta - analysis , we first present the three statistical properties of ICC HT as follows . ( i ) Monotonicity . ICC HT is a monotonically increasing function of the ratio τ 2 / σ 2 y . When the common within - study variance σ 2 y is fixed , ICC HT will solely increase with the between - study variance τ 2 . This property was referred to as the “dependence on the extent of heterogeneity” by Higgins and Thompson ( 2002 ) . ( ii ) Location and scale invariance . ICC HT is not affected by the location and scale of the effect sizes . This property was referred to as the “scale invariance” by Higgins and Thompson ( 2002 ) . ( iii ) Study size invariance . ICC HT is not affected by the total number of studies k . This property was referred to as the “size invariance” by Higgins and Thompson ( 2002 ) . Thanks to the above properties , the I 2 statistic is nowadays the most popular measure for quantifying the heterogeneity in meta - analysis , compared to other existing measures including Q and τ 2 . Nevertheless , we do wish to point out that the “size invariance” in their property ( iii ) only represents the study size invariance but not includes the sample size invariance . As shown in the motivating example and also from the historical evidence in the literature , ICC HT does suffer from a heavy dependence on the study sample sizes . While for the new measure of heterogeneity in ( 7 ) , we show in Appendix A that ICC MA shares the following four properties : ( i ′ ) Monotonicity . ICC MA is a monotonically increasing function of the ratio τ 2 / σ 2pop . When the common population variance σ 2pop is fixed , ICC MA will solely increase with the between - study variance τ 2 . 10 ( ii ′ ) Location and scale invariance . ICC MA is not affected by the location and scale of the effect sizes . ( iii ′ ) Study size invariance . ICC MA is not affected by the total number of studies k . ( iv ′ ) Sample size invariance . ICC MA is not affected by the sample size n i of each study . Note that the first three properties for ICC MA are essentially the same as those for ICC HT . While for the importance of property ( iv ′ ) , let us illustrate again using the motivating example in Section 2 . Under the assumption of a common population variance , the term σ 2pop remains constant at 1 no matter how the sample sizes vary . Further by ( 7 ) , the value of ICC MA under each scenario will always be 0 . 0025 / ( 0 . 0025 + 1 ) ≈ 0 . 25 % , indicating that the three study populations are indeed highly overlapped with a small amount of heterogeneity . To conclude , it is because of the sample size invariance in property ( iv ′ ) that distinguishes our new ICC MA from the existing ICC HT , which also perfectly explains why ICC MA can serve as a new measure for quantifying the heterogeneity between the study populations . Due to its sample size invariance , we regard ICC MA as an absolute measure of heterogeneity . 4 The I 2A statistic In this section , we propose an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the newly defined measure of heterogeneity in ( 7 ) , namely the I 2A statistic , for the practical implementation to meta - analysis . More specifically , to better estimate ICC MA , we first provide a litera - ture review on the estimation of ICC in the ANOVA setting . Following the random - effects ANOVA in ( 4 ) , the total variance of the observations is given by (cid:80) ki = 1 (cid:80) n i j = 1 ( y ij − ¯ y ) 2 , which can be divided into two components as the sum of squares between the populations and the error sum of squares within the populations . Based on this variance partition - ing , Cochran ( 1939 ) derived the method of moments estimators of τ 2 and σ 2 , and then by plugging them into formula ( 6 ) , it yields the well known ANOVA estimator for the 11 unknown ICC . Additionally , Thomas and Hultquist ( 1978 ) and Donner ( 1979 ) proposed an approximate confidence interval for ICC . For a comprehensive review on other existing estimators of ICC , one may refer to Appendix B . Following the random - effects model for meta - analysis in ( 1 ) , we first assume that ˆ σ 2 y i are the estimated within - study variance from each study , as also mentioned in Section 3 . 1 . We further define the mean square between the populations as MSB MA = 1 k − 1 k (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:8) n i ( y i − ¯ y ) 2 (cid:9) , ( 8 ) where ¯ y = (cid:80) ki = 1 ( n i y i ) / (cid:80) ki = 1 n i , and the mean square within the populations as MSW MA = 1 (cid:80) ki = 1 ( n i − 1 ) k (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:8) n i ( n i − 1 ) ˆ σ 2 y i ) (cid:9) . ( 9 ) Moreover , let ¯ n = 1 k − 1 (cid:32) k (cid:88) i = 1 n i − k (cid:88) i = 1 n 2 i / k (cid:88) i = 1 n i (cid:33) ( 10 ) be the adjusted mean sample size ( Thomas and Hultquist , 1978 ) that accounts for the variation of the sample sizes from different studies . To estimate ICC MA , we first derive the expectations of MSB MA and MSW MA by the following lemma . Lemma 1 . With model ( 4 ) and the summary data y i , ˆ σ 2 y i for i = 1 , . . . , k in meta - analysis , E ( MSB MA ) = ¯ nτ 2 + σ 2pop , and E ( MSW MA ) = σ 2pop . Further by equating MSB MA and MSW MA as their respective means E ( MSB MA ) and E ( MSW MA ) , we can derive the method of moments estimators of the between - study variance and the common population variance as ˆ τ 2 = ( MSB MA − MSW MA ) / ¯ n and ˆ σ 2pop = MSW MA . Finally , by plugging them back to ( 7 ) , our new estimator for ICC MA is given as I 2A = max (cid:26) MSB MA − MSW MA MSB MA + ( ¯ n − 1 ) MSW MA , 0 (cid:27) . ( 11 ) The footnote “A” in our I 2 A statistic can represent that we are estimating the alternative measure , or the absolute measure , of the heterogeneity between the study populations . 12 In contrast , the original I 2 statistic can be expressed as the I 2R statistic , which indeed provides an estimate of the relative measure for the heterogeneity between the observed effect sizes . Moreover , the same as in ( 3 ) for I 2 , the maximum operation is taken to avoid a negative estimate . Next , to derive a confidence interval for ICC MA , we first consider the balanced case where the sample sizes for different studies are all the same and introduce the following lemma . Lemma 2 . With model ( 4 ) and the notations in Lemma 1 , for the balanced case , MSB MA is distributed with ( nτ 2 + σ 2pop ) χ 2 k − 1 / ( k − 1 ) , MSW MA is distributed with σ 2pop χ 2 k ( n − 1 ) / { k ( n − 1 ) } , and they are independent of each other . Based on the results of Lemma 2 , an exact 100 ( 1 − α ) % confidence interval for ICC MA can be constructed as (cid:20) max (cid:26) F MA / F 1 − α / 2 − 1 n + F MA / F 1 − α / 2 − 1 , 0 (cid:27) , max (cid:26) F MA / F α / 2 − 1 n + F MA / F α / 2 − 1 , 0 (cid:27)(cid:21) , ( 12 ) where F MA = MSB MA / MSW MA , and F α is the ( 100 α ) th percentile of the F distribution with k − 1 and k ( n − 1 ) degrees of freedom . For the unbalanced case when n i are not all the same , MSB MA does not follow a chi - square distribution so that an exact confidence interval for ICC MA will not be possible . In view of this , we follow the same spirit as in Thomas and Hultquist ( 1978 ) and Donner ( 1979 ) and apply the adjusted mean sample size ¯ n to replace n in the confidence interval , yielding an approximate 100 ( 1 − α ) % confidence interval for ICC MA as (cid:20) max (cid:26) F MA / F 1 − α / 2 − 1 ¯ n + F MA / F 1 − α / 2 − 1 , 0 (cid:27) , max (cid:26) F MA / F α / 2 − 1 ¯ n + F MA / F α / 2 − 1 , 0 (cid:27)(cid:21) . ( 13 ) When n i = n for all i = 1 , . . . , k , we note that the adjusted mean sample size ¯ n reduces to the common sample size n . This shows that the confidence interval in ( 12 ) is , in fact , a special case of that in ( 13 ) . Because of this , we can regard ( 13 ) as the unified confidence interval for both the balanced and unbalanced cases , and so will not distinguish the two formulas in the remainder of the paper . 13 Table 2 : The summary data of the 10 studies for the meta - analysis from Jeong et al .

This is the simplest scenario , in which the effect sizes are represented by the means y i from individual studies , each considering only one arm . In Sections 5 and 6 , we will consider two other commonly used effect sizes , including the mean difference ( MD ) and the standardized mean difference ( SMD ) , and moreover derive the detailed formulas for the I 2A statistic respectively . More specifically , we will describe how to calculate MSB MA , MSW MA and ¯ n in formula ( 11 ) for different effect size types . Additionally , we will also provide real data analyses and numerical results for each effect size to illustrate the performance of the I 2A statistic in practice . 4 . 1 Real data analysis To illustrate the application of the I 2A statistic in quantifying the heterogeneity among studies , we revisit a previous meta - analysis conducted by Jeong et al . ( 2014 ) , which 14 investigated the stem cell - based therapy as a novel approach for the stroke treatment . Specifically , among various measures of efficacy and safety , we focus on the point difference in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale as the outcome . The summary data for the 10 studies are presented in Table 2 . To calculate the I 2A statistic , we have (cid:80) 10 i = 1 n i = 92 , ¯ y = (cid:80) 10 i = 1 n i y i / (cid:80) 10 i = 1 n i = − 7 . 55 , MSB MA = 189 . 83 , MSW MA = 25 . 81 , and ¯ n = 8 . 97 . Further by formula ( 11 ) , it yields that I 2A = max (cid:26) 189 . 83 − 25 . 81 189 . 83 + ( 8 . 97 − 1 ) × 25 . 81 , 0 (cid:27) = 0 . 41 . While for comparison , we also compute the I 2 statistic . By treating ˆ σ 2 y i in Table 2 as the true values of σ 2 y i , we have (cid:80) 10 i = 1 w i = 7 . 68 and (cid:80) 10 i = 1 w i y i = − 43 . 39 . This leads to Cochran’s Q statistic as Q = 106 . 26 . Moreover , by formula ( 3 ) , we have I 2 = max (cid:26) 106 . 26 − ( 10 − 1 ) 106 . 26 , 0 (cid:27) = 0 . 92 . −30 −20 −10 0 10 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 Population distributions −30 −20 −10 0 10 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 Sampling distributions Figure 2 : Population distributions of the ten studies and the sampling distributions of the observed effect sizes . For each study , the population distribution is assumed to be normal with mean y i and variance n i ˆ σ 2 y i . The sampling distribution of the effect size is assumed to be normal with mean y i and variance ˆ σ 2 y i . To further compare the I 2A statistic and the I 2 statistic , as a common practice we 15 assume that the 10 studies are all normally distributed . Then by the reported means and variances , we plot their respective population distributions and the sampling distributions of the observed effect sizes in Figure 2 for visualization . From the figure , it is evident that the 10 studies are not very heterogeneous since most of the study populations are largely overlapped in the range roughly from - 15 to 5 , corresponding to a measure of 0 . 41 for the I 2A statistic . By contrast , the sampling distributions of the observed effect sizes are less overlapped with each other , indicating a much higher heterogeneity at 0 . 92 by the I 2 statistic . 4 . 2 Numerical results To conduct simulations that compare the performance of the I 2A statistic to the I 2 statistic , we consider the random - effects model ( 5 ) with µ = 0 and σ 2 = 100 . For the between - study variance , we consider τ 2 = 9 or 90 that corresponds to ICC MA as 9 / ( 9 + 100 ) = 0 . 083 or 90 / ( 90 + 100 ) = 0 . 474 , respectively . We also let k = 3 or 10 to represent the small or large number of studies included in the meta - analysis . For the sample size of each study , we consider the unbalanced design with the sample size of the i th study being i ∗ n , where i = 1 , . . . , k and the common n ranges from 10 to 100 . With each of the above settings , we then generate the raw data from model ( 5 ) and report the summary data y i and ˆ σ 2 y i for the k studies . Finally with M = 10 , 000 repetitions , we compute the mean values of the I 2A and I 2 statistics and plot them in Figure 3 . From Figure 3 , it is evident that the I 2 statistic is always monotonically increasing with the sample size n . This is consistent with what was observed in R¨ucker et al . ( 2008 ) that the I 2 statistic always increases rapidly to 1 when the sample sizes are large . By contrast , with each dashed line representing the heterogeneity ICC MA between the study populations , we note that the performance of the I 2A statistic is not impacted by the sample size . And more interesting , it can perform even better when the number of studies k is large , which coincides with the asymptotic results on the consistent estimates of the unknown quantities . 16 k = 3 , ICC MA = 0 . 083 n 10 30 50 70 90 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 IQ I 2 k = 10 , ICC MA = 0 . 083 n 10 30 50 70 90 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 k = 3 , ICC MA = 0 . 474 n 10 30 50 70 90 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 k = 10 , ICC MA = 0 . 474 n 10 30 50 70 90 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 Figure 3 : Simulated mean values of the two statistics for the raw mean with 10 , 000 repetitions .

For a meta - analysis of the mean difference , the summary statistics for each study often include the observed mean differences between treatment and control groups y i , the sample sizes n Ti and n Ci , and the standard errors ˆ σ y Ti and ˆ σ y Ci . By defining the adjusted sample size as n i = 1 / ( 1 / n Ti + 1 / n Ci ) for each study , MSB MA and ¯ n can be computed by formulas ( 8 ) and ( 10 ) , respectively . Moreover , MSW MA can be computed by MSW MA = (cid:80) ki = 1 (cid:110) n Ti (cid:0) n Ti − 1 (cid:1) ˆ σ 2 y Ti + n Ci (cid:0) n Ci − 1 (cid:1) ˆ σ 2 y Ci (cid:111) (cid:80) ki = 1 ( n Ti + n Ci ) − 2 k . Finally , the I 2A statistic can be computed directly by formula ( 11 ) . For a comprehensive understanding of the model specification and the whole procedure for estimating the I 2A statistic , one may refer to Appendix C . 5 . 1 Real data analysis To exemplify the utilization of the I 2A statistic for the mean differences , we revisit a meta - analysis conducted in a study by Avery et al . ( 2022 ) . This study explores the effect of interventions to taper long term opioid treatment for chronic non - cancer pain . Among the several interventions , we consider the effect of acupuncture . For each study , the observed effect size is the mean difference of reduced opioid dose . For easy reference , we provide the summary data for the three studies in Table 3 . 18 By Table 3 , the estimated effect sizes y i for the three studies are computed as 32 . 0 , - 4 . 8 and - 14 . 8 , and the adjusted sample sizes n i for the three studies are 3 . 60 , 26 . 67 and 8 . 74 , respectively . From these values , we can further obtain ¯ y = − 3 . 65 , MSB MA = 2848 . 76 , MSW MA = 586 . 93 , and the adjusted mean sample size ¯ n = 9 . 24 . Finally , by formula ( 11 ) , it yields that I 2A = max (cid:26) 2848 . 76 − 586 . 93 2848 . 76 + ( 9 . 24 − 1 ) × 586 . 93 , 0 (cid:27) = 0 . 29 . To compute the I 2 statistic , we first derive the within - study variances of y i as 272 . 14 , 20 . 29 and 65 . 48 , respectively . Then we have (cid:80) 3 i = 1 w i = 0 . 07 and (cid:80) 3 i = 1 w i y i = 0 . 35 . This leads to Cochran’s Q statistic as Q = 6 . 50 . Moreover , by formula ( 3 ) , we have I 2 = max (cid:26) 6 . 50 − ( 3 − 1 ) 6 . 50 , 0 (cid:27) = 0 . 69 . To further compare the I 2A and I 2 statistics , we also plot the population distributions for the three studies and the sampling distributions of the observed effect sizes in Figure 4 for visualization . We note that two of the populations are largely overlapped with little heterogeneity , whereas the third population is moderately deviated . Given this , we conclude that the heterogeneity among the three studies may not be substantial overall , if measured by the I 2A statistic . By contrast , the I 2 statistic concludes a very substantial heterogeneity between the sampling distributions of the observed effect sizes . 5 . 2 Numerical results To numerically compare the I 2A and I 2 statistics , we generate the data from two - arm studies as follows : y Tij = µ T + δ Ti + ξ Tij , j = 1 , . . . , n Ti , y Cij ′ = µ C + δ Ci + ξ Cij ′ , j ′ = 1 , . . . , n Ci , ( 14 ) where ξ Tij and ξ Cij ′ are i . i . d . normal random errors with mean 0 and common variance σ 2 . For a more detailed description of model ( 14 ) , one may refer to Appendix Appendix D . 19 −50 0 50 100 0 . 000 0 . 010 0 . 020 Population distributions −50 0 50 100 0 . 00 0 . 04 0 . 08 Population distributions Figure 4 : Population distributions of the three studies and the sampling distributions of the observed effect sizes with blue for Zheng ( 2008 ) , green for Zheng ( 2019 ) , and red for Jackson ( 2021 ) . For each study , the population distribution is assumed to be normal with mean y Ti − y Ci and variance { n Ti ( n Ti − 1 ) ˆ σ 2 y Ti + n Ci ( n Ci − 1 ) ˆ σ 2 y Ci } / ( n Ti + n Ci − 2 ) . The sampling distribution of the effect size is assumed to be normal with mean y Ti − y Ci and variance ˆ σ 2 y Ti + ˆ σ 2 y Ci . Without loss of generality , we set µ T = µ C = 0 and σ 2 = 1 . We also generate δ Ti and δ Ci independently from N ( 0 , 0 . 045 ) or N ( 0 , 0 . 45 ) . With the observed effect sizes being (cid:80) n T j = 1 y Tij / n Ti − (cid:80) n C j ′ = 1 y Cij ′ / n Ci , the between - study variance is τ 2 = 0 . 09 or 0 . 9 , yielding an ICC MA value of 0 . 083 or 0 . 474 , respectively . For other settings , we consider k = 3 or 10 to represent a small or large number of studies within the meta - analysis , and the sample sizes of both treatment arms , n Ti and n Ci , to be identical . We further let the sample sizes for both arms of the i th study be i ∗ n , where i ranges from 1 to k , and n varies from 10 to 100 . Then for each simulation setting , we proceed to generate the raw data and compute the summary statistics , including y Ti , y Ci , ˆ σ 2 y Ti and ˆ σ 2 y Ci , for each of the k studies . Finally with M = 10 , 000 repetitions , we calculate and visualize the mean values of the I 2A and I 2 statistics in Figure 5 . From Figure 5 , we once again observe that the I 2 statistic monotonically increases with the sample size n . On the other hand , the performance of the I 2 A statistic is not impacted by the sample size , and meanwhile it performs even better when the number of 20 studies k is large . k = 3 , ICC MA = 0 . 083 n 10 30 50 70 90 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 IQ I 2 k = 10 , ICC MA = 0 . 083 n 10 30 50 70 90 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 k = 3 , ICC MA = 0 . 474 n 10 30 50 70 90 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 k = 10 , ICC MA = 0 . 474 n 10 30 50 70 90 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 Figure 5 : Simulated mean values of the two statistics for the mean difference with 10 , 000 repetitions . The red lines with circles represent the I 2A statistic , the green lines with tri - angles represent the I 2 statistic , and the dashed lines stand for the absolute heterogeneity ICC MA . 6 The I 2A statistic for the standardized mean differ - ence In addition to the mean difference ( MD ) , another commonly used effect size for continuous outcomes in two - arm studies is the standardized mean difference ( SMD ) . The SMD is par - ticularly useful when the assumption of equal population variances across different studies 21 cannot be made . In such cases , the mean difference in each study is standardized to a uni - form scale , ensuring comparability for the subsequent meta - analysis . Consequently , the estimated standardized mean difference y i can be viewed as the observed mean difference of two population arms , both with a variance of 1 , indicating σ 2pop = 1 . To compute the I 2A statistic for SMD , we employ the same procedures as those used for MD to determine MSB MA and ¯ n . More specifically , considering the summary statistics including the observed SMD y i , the sample sizes n Ci for the control groups , and the sample sizes n Ti for the treatment groups , in conjunction with the adjusted sample sizes n i = 1 / ( 1 / n Ci + 1 / n Ti ) for each study , we compute MSB MA and ¯ n by formulas ( 8 ) and ( 10 ) , respectively . Further by σ 2 pop = 1 , we also set MSW MA directly to 1 . Ultimately , the heterogeneity among the studies can be quantified by the I 2A statistic as described in ( 11 ) . For a comprehensive understanding of the model specifications as well as the methodology for estimating the I 2A statistic , one may refer to Appendix Appendix E . 6 . 1 Real data analysis To assess the utility of the I 2A statistic in quantifying the heterogeneity for SMD , we revisit the real data example presented in Section 5 . 1 . With the summary data provided in Table 3 , we first compute the estimated SMD and its corresponding variance for each study . Two commonly used statistics for estimating SMD are Cohen’s d ( Cohen , 2013 ) and Hedges’ g ( Hedges , 1981 ) . For a detailed guide on computing Cohen’s d and Hedges’ g , one may refer to Lin and Aloe ( 2021 ) . In this section , we employ Hedges’ g that derives an unbiased estimate for SMD . By the formulas provided in Lin and Aloe ( 2021 ) , we can derive the estimated SMDs for the three studies as 0 . 96 , - 0 . 20 and - 0 . 62 , and the adjusted sample sizes n i as 3 . 60 , 26 . 67 and 8 . 74 , respectively , Moreover , we have ¯ y = − 0 . 19 , MSB MA = 3 . 19 , MSW MA = 1 , and the adjusted mean sample size ¯ n = 9 . 24 . Finally , by formula ( 11 ) , the I 2A statistic is 22 given as I 2A = max (cid:26) 3 . 19 − 1 3 . 19 + ( 9 . 24 − 1 ) × 1 , 0 (cid:27) = 0 . 19 . To compute the I 2 statistic , we first derive the within - study variances of y i as 0 . 31 , 0 . 04 and 0 . 12 , respectively . Further with (cid:80) 3 i = 1 w i = 38 . 12 and (cid:80) 3 i = 1 w i y i = − 7 . 43 , Cochran’s Q statistic can be computed as Q = 5 . 83 . Finally , by formula ( 3 ) , we have I 2 = max (cid:26) 5 . 83 − ( 3 − 1 ) 5 . 83 , 0 (cid:27) = 0 . 66 . To further compare the two statistics , we plot the scaled population distributions for the three studies and the sampling distributions of the observed effect sizes in Figure 6 . Specifically , with SMDs as the effect sizes , all the scaled populations have a common variance of 1 . Moreover , we apply the estimated SMDs as the population means . Com - pared to Figure 4 , the three scaled populations in Figure 6 get more close to each other , resulting in a even smaller value for the I 2A statistic . On the other hand , a measure of 0 . 66 for the I 2 statistic indicates a large heterogeneity between the observed effect sizes . 6 . 2 Numerical results To compare the I 2A and I 2 statistics for SMD , we generate the data from the following two - arm studies : y Tij = σ i ( µ T + δ Ti + ξ Tij ) , j = 1 , . . . , n Ti , y C ij ′ = σ i ( µ C + δ C i + ξ C ij ′ ) , j ′ = 1 , . . . , n C i , ( 15 ) where ξ Tij and ξ Cij ′ are i . i . d . normal random errors with mean 0 and variance 1 . Compared with model ( 14 ) , this new model contains an additional parameter σ i , which is used to rescale each study . For a more detailed description of model ( 15 ) , one may refer to Appendix Appendix E . In this simulation , we let σ i follow a uniform distribution U ( 0 . 5 , 1 . 5 ) , which yields unequal population variances for the k studies and thus SMD ought to be applied rather than MD . The other settings are kept the same as those in Section 6 . 2 .

For each study , the population distribution is assumed to be normal with mean SMD and variance 1 . The sampling distribution of the effect size is assumed to be normal with mean SMD and the variance is assumed to be the within - study variance . simulation setting , we proceed to generate the raw data and compute the summary statis - tics , including y Ti , y Ci , ˆ σ 2 y Ti and ˆ σ 2 y Ci , for each of the k studies . Finally with M = 10 , 000 repetitions , we compute and plot the mean values of the I 2A and I 2 statistics in Figure 7 . From Figure 7 , it is evident that the I 2 statistic is always monotonically increasing with the sample size n , which is consistent with the simulation results in Sections 4 . 2 and 5 . 2 . By contrast , the I 2A statistic can always provide a good measure for the quantify of heterogeneity between the study populations , no matter whether the study sample sizes are large or not . 7 Conclusion and discussion Quantifying the heterogeneity is an important issue in meta - analysis for decision making . The presence of heterogeneity affects the extent to which generalizable conclusions can be formed and determines whether the random - effects model or the fixed - effect model should be employed . The Q statistic is commonly used to test for the existence of the 24 k = 3 , ICC MA = 0 . 083 n 10 30 50 70 90 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 IQ I 2 k = 10 , ICC MA = 0 . 083 n 10 30 50 70 90 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 k = 3 , ICC MA = 0 . 474 n 10 30 50 70 90 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 k = 10 , ICC MA = 0 . 474 n 10 30 50 70 90 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 Figure 7 : Simulated mean values of the two statistics for the mean difference with 10 , 000 repetitions . The red lines with circles represent the I 2A statistic , the green lines with tri - angles represent the I 2 statistic , and the dashed lines stand for the absolute heterogeneity ICC MA . 25 heterogeneity . However , as mentioned in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions ( Higgins et al . , 2019 ) , this test may have lowe power when the number of studies is small . Some also argue that the heterogeneity always exists , whether detectable by statistical tests or not . Thus , as a way to remedy , the I 2 statistic was further introduced to measure the extent of heterogeneity . Nowadays , both the Q statistic and the I 2 statistic are routinely reported in the forest plot in meta - analysis , and the choice between the random - effects model and the fixed - effect model often relies on these two statistics . More specifically , if the p - value of the Q statistic is less than 0 . 1 and the I 2 statistic exceeds 0 . 5 , the random - effects model is preferred for meta - analysis ; otherwise , the fixed - effect model will be chosen ( Jiang and Huang , 2021 ; Chinnaratha et al . , 2016 ; Yang et al . , 2012 ) . It is noted , however , that these two statistics are highly correlated since the I 2 statistic is a monotonically increasing function of the Q statistic . Additionally , the p - value based on the Q statistic only indicates whether there is a statistical significance ( Gelman and Stern , 2006 ) , but not reflect regarding the biological difference between the studies . In this paper , we have introduced a new measure , denoted as ICC MA , to quantify the between - study heterogeneity for meta - analysis . To explore the distinction between ICC HT and ICC MA , we have also drawn an interesting connection between ANOVA and meta - analysis , and learned that the essence of ICC HT is to quantify the heterogeneity between the observed effect sizes . As demonstrated by the motivating example in Section 2 , the sampling distributions of the observed effect sizes may exhibit a significant depen - dency on the sample sizes , and they will asymptotically converge to their true effect sizes . Accordingly , with large sample sizes , the observed effect sizes will also yield an increased ICC HT close to one , no matter whether the underlying heterogeneity between the study populations is truly large or not . As an important alternative , our newly defined ICC MA is proposed to directly quantify the heterogeneity between the study populations . More specifically , we have systemati - cally studied the statistical properties of ICC MA , including the monotonicity , the location and scale invariance , the study size invariance , and the sample size invariance . It is the 26 sample size invariance that distinguishes our new absolute measure of heterogeneity from ICC HT . Moreover , we have also proposed the I 2A statistic to serve as the estimator of ICC MA . The footnote “A” represents that that we are to estimate the absolute measure of heterogeneity in meta - analysis . For practical use , the exact formulas for the I 2A statistic are also derived under two common scenarios with the mean difference or the standard - ized mean difference as the effect size . Simulations and real data analysis demonstrate that the I 2A statistic provides an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the absolute hetero - geneity between the study populations , and as expected , it also does not depend on the study sample sizes . To conclude , the I 2A statistic can serve as a supplemental measure to monitor the situations where the study effect sizes are indeed similar with little biological difference . In such scenario , the fixed - effect model can be appropriate . Whereas if the sample sizes are very large , we note that the I 2 statistic may still rapidly increase to 1 showing a large heterogeneity and subsequently a random - effects model will continue to be adopted . In view of this , we are thus confident that the I 2A statistic can add new value to meta - analysis , for example , being included in the forest plot as a supplement to the I 2 statistic . Lastly , it is worth noting that there are also several interesting directions for future research . First , the current work has presented its primary focus on meta - analysis with continuous outcomes . As a parallel work , it can be equally important for the I 2A statistic to be further extended to meta - analysis with binary outcomes , which are also commonly encountered in clinical studies . Second , it is of interest to study whether the I 2A statistic can be further improved , and in particular , by Figures 3 , 5 and 7 , we note that the I 2A statistic tends to slightly underestimate ICC MA when k is small and ICC MA is large . In addition , future research may also be warranted to , more deeply , explore the practical performance of the I 2A statistic in evidence - based practice . 27 References Avery , N . , McNeilage , A .

By the definition in ( 7 ) , we can rewrite ICC MA as ICC MA = 1 1 + σ 2pop / τ 2 . This shows that ICC MA is a monotonically increasing function of τ 2 / σ 2pop and so property ( i ′ ) holds . Proof of “Location and scale invariance” . To prove the location and scale invariance , for any constants a and b > 0 , we assume that the newly observed effect sizes are y ′ ij = a + by ij for i = 1 , . . . , k and j = 1 , . . . , n i . Let also µ ′ i = a + bµ i be the true effect sizes of the new study populations . Then consequently , the between - study variance and the common population variance are given as ( τ 2 ) ′ = var ( µ ′ i ) = var ( a + bµ i ) = b 2 τ 2 , ( σ 2pop ) ′ = var ( a + by ij | a + bµ i ) = b 2 σ 2pop . Further by ( 7 ) , the measure of heterogeneity between the new studies is ICC ′ MA = ( τ 2 ) ′ ( τ 2 ) ′ + ( σ 2pop ) ′ = b 2 τ 2 b 2 τ 2 + b 2 σ 2pop = τ 2 τ 2 + σ 2pop = ICC MA . This verifies the property of location and scale invariance . Proof of “Study size invariance” . To prove the study size invariance , we assume there are a total of k ′ studies . Then by the random - effects model in ( 1 ) , since the individual means µ i are i . i . d . from N ( µ , τ 2 ) , the between - study variance will remain unchanged as τ 2 regardless of the number of studies . Further by the common population variance assumption , we have var ( y ij | µ i ) = σ 2pop for all i = 1 , . . . , k ′ and j = 1 , . . . , n i . This proves the property of study size invariance . Proof of “Sample size invariance” . To prove the sample size invariance , we assume that the new sample sizes are n ′ i for each study , and consequently y ′ i = (cid:80) n ′ i j = 1 y ij / n ′ i are the new 32 effect sizes . Then under the common population variance assumption that var ( y ij | µ i ) = σ 2pop for all i and j , we have σ 2 y ′ i = var ( y ′ i | µ i ) = σ 2pop / n ′ i , or equivalently , n ′ i σ 2 y ′ i = σ 2pop . That is , no matter how the sample sizes vary , the common population variance will always remain unchanged . Finally , noting that τ 2 also remains since the study populations are unaltered , we thus have the property of sample size invariance . Appendix B Methods for estimating ICC To estimate ICC from the random - effects ANOVA in ( 4 ) , we first partition the total variation of the observations into two components as k (cid:88) i = 1 n i (cid:88) j = 1 ( y ij − ¯ y ) 2 = k (cid:88) i = 1 n i ( y i − ¯ y ) 2 + k (cid:88) i = 1 n i (cid:88) j = 1 ( y ij − y i ) 2 , ( 16 ) where y i = (cid:80) n i j = 1 y ij / n i are the individual sample means , and ¯ y = (cid:80) ki = 1 (cid:80) n i j = 1 y ij / (cid:80) ki = 1 n i is the grand sample mean . More specifically , the term on the left - hand side of ( 16 ) is the total sum of squares ( SST ) , and the two terms on the right - hand side are the sum of squares between the populations ( SSB ) and the error sum of squares within the populations ( SSW ) , respectively . By equating SSB and SSW to their respective expected values , Cochran ( 1939 ) derived the method of moments estimators of τ 2 and σ 2 . Further by plugging these two estimators in formula ( 6 ) , it yields the ANOVA estimator for the unknown ICC . By Smith ( 1957 ) , the ANOVA estimator is a biased but consistent estimator . Moreover , as the method of moments estimators may take a negative value when SSB / k < SSW / ( (cid:80) ki = 1 ( n i − 1 ) , one often truncates the negative value to 0 when it occurs . For the balanced case when the sample sizes are all equal , Searle ( 1971 ) derived an exact confidence interval for ICC based on the ANOVA table . For the unbalanced case , however , the exact confidence interval from the ANOVA table is not available . As a remedy , Thomas and Hultquist ( 1978 ) and Donner ( 1979 ) suggested an adjusted confidence interval in which the common sample size in the balanced case is replaced by the average sample size . They further showed by 33 simulation studies that the adjusted confidence interval performs very well in terms of the coverage probability . Besides the well - known ANOVA estimator , it is noteworthy that there are also other estimators for ICC in the literature . To name a few , Thomas and Hultquist ( 1978 ) con - structed a confidence interval for ICC based on the unweighted average of the individual sample means ˜ y = (cid:80) ki = 1 y i / k . Observing that ICC = ( τ 2 / σ 2 ) / ( τ 2 / σ 2 + 1 ) , Wald ( 1940 ) proposed another estimator for ICC by first estimating τ 2 / σ 2 , yet as a limitation , there does not exist a closed form for either the point estimator or its confidence interval . As another alternative , by the facts that cov ( y ij , y il ) = τ 2 for j ̸ = l and var ( y ij ) = τ 2 + σ 2 , Karlin et al . ( 1981 ) proposed to estimate ICC by the Pearson product - moment correlation computed over all the possible pairs of ( y ij , y il ) for j ̸ = l with some weighting schemes . In addition , Donner and Koval ( 1980a , b ) proposed an iterative algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimator ( MLE ) for ICC directly , and presented its performance by simulations when the number of studies is large . For more estimators of ICC , one may also refer to Donner ( 1986 ) , Sahai and Ojeda ( 2004 ) , and the references therein . Despite the rich literature on the estimation of ICC , none of the existing estimators is known to be uniformly better than the others in the unbalanced case ( Sahai and Ojeda , 2004 ) . In practice , thanks to its simple and elegant form , the ANOVA estimator is frequently treated as the optimal estimator and so is most commonly used for estimating ICC . Lastly , we also note that the ANOVA estimator and the confidence interval suggested by Thomas and Hultquist ( 1978 ) and Donner ( 1979 ) can be readily implemented by the function ICCest in the R package ‘ICC’ . 34 Appendix C The derivation of the point estimate ( 10 ) and the confidence interval ( 11 ) for ICC MA To prove the properties of the point estimator and the confidence interval for ICC MA in ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) , we first give the proofs of the two lemmas . Proof of Lemma 1 . Denote by σ 2 y i = σ 2 / n i . With the summary data , y i are independent normal random variables with mean µ and variances τ 2 + σ 2 y i . Then the variance of (cid:80) ki = 1 n i y i is Var (cid:32) k (cid:88) i = 1 n i y i (cid:33) = k (cid:88) i = 1 Var ( n i y i ) = τ 2 k (cid:88) i = 1 n 2 i + k (cid:88) i = 1 n 2 i σ 2 y i . Thus , E (cid:32) k (cid:88) i = 1 n i y i (cid:33) 2 = Var (cid:32) k (cid:88) i = 1 n i y i (cid:33) + (cid:40) E (cid:32) k (cid:88) i = 1 n i y i (cid:33)(cid:41) 2 = τ 2 k (cid:88) i = 1 n 2 i + k (cid:88) i = 1 n 2 i σ 2 y i + µ 2 (cid:32) k (cid:88) i = 1 n i (cid:33) 2 . Further , it can be derived that E (cid:40) k (cid:88) i = 1 n i ( y i − ¯ y ) 2 (cid:41) = k (cid:88) i = 1 n i E (cid:0) y 2 i (cid:1) − 1 (cid:80) ki = 1 n i E (cid:32) k (cid:88) i = 1 n i y i (cid:33) 2 = k (cid:88) i = 1 n i (cid:2) Var ( y i ) + { E ( y i ) } 2 (cid:3) − 1 (cid:80) ki = 1 n i E (cid:32) k (cid:88) i = 1 n i y i (cid:33) 2 = k (cid:88) i = 1 n i (cid:0) τ 2 + σ 2 y i + µ 2 (cid:1) − 1 (cid:80) ki = 1 n i (cid:40) τ 2 k (cid:88) i = 1 n 2 i + k (cid:88) i = 1 n 2 i σ 2 y i + µ 2 ( k (cid:88) i = 1 n i ) 2 (cid:41) = τ 2 ( k (cid:88) i = 1 n i − (cid:80) ki = 1 n 2 i (cid:80) ki = 1 n i ) + k (cid:88) i = 1 n i σ 2 y i − (cid:80) ki = 1 n 2 i σ 2 y i (cid:80) ki = 1 n i . 35 Since σ 2 y i = σ 2pop / n i , and ¯ n = ( (cid:80) ki = 1 n i − (cid:80) ki = 1 n 2 i / (cid:80) ki = 1 n i ) / ( k − 1 ) , E (cid:40) k (cid:88) i = 1 n i ( y i − ¯ y ) 2 (cid:41) = ( k − 1 ) ¯ nτ 2 + ( k − 1 ) σ 2pop . Thus , E ( MSB MA ) = ¯ nτ 2 + σ 2pop . As for E ( MSW MA ) = σ 2pop , it is derived directly by the fact that E ( n i ˆ σ 2 y i ) = σ 2pop . Proof of Lemma 2 . With model ( 4 ) and the notations in Lemma 1 , y i is independent of n ˆ σ 2 y i for i = 1 , . . . , k . Given that MSB MA is a function of y i , and MSW MA is a function of n ˆ σ 2 y i , they are independent of each other . Besides , let n be the common sample size , the adjusted mean sample size ¯ n reduces to n for the balanced case . Let Y = ( y 1 , . . . , y k ) T , Σ = Var ( Y ) = ( τ 2 + σ 2 y ) I k with I k being the k × k identity matrix , and 1 k be the column vector of length k with all the elements being 1 . Let Z ∼ N ( 0 , I k ) . Then Y can be expressed as Y = Σ 1 / 2 Z + µ 1 k = ( τ 2 + σ 2 y ) 1 / 2 Z + µ 1 k . By the above notations , (cid:80) ki = 1 n ( y i − ¯ y ) 2 can be written as k (cid:88) i = 1 n ( y i − ¯ y ) 2 = n Y T (cid:18) I k − 1 k 1 k 1 T k (cid:19) Y = n (cid:0) Σ 1 / 2 Z + µ 1 k (cid:1) T (cid:18) I k − 1 k 1 k 1 T k (cid:19) (cid:0) Σ 1 / 2 Z + µ 1 k (cid:1) = ( nτ 2 + nσ 2 y ) Z T (cid:18) I k − 1 k 1 k 1 T k (cid:19) Z . Note that ( I k − 1 k 1 k 1 T k ) is an idempotent matrix with rank k − 1 . So it can be decomposed as ( I k − 1 k 1 k 1 T k ) = V Λ V T , where Λ = diag ( 1 , . . . , 1 , 0 ) and V = ( v 1 , . . . , v k ) is an orthogonal matrix . With v T i Z i . i . d . ∼ N ( 0 , 1 ) , the distribution of (cid:80) ki = 1 ( y i − ¯ y ) 2 can be derived as k (cid:88) i = 1 n ( y i − ¯ y ) 2 = (cid:0) nτ 2 + nσ 2 y (cid:1) ( V T Z ) T Λ ( V T Z ) = (cid:0) nτ 2 + nσ 2 y (cid:1) k − 1 (cid:88) i = 1 ( v T i Z ) 2 = (cid:0) nτ 2 + nσ 2 y (cid:1) χ 2 k − 1 = { nτ 2 + σ 2pop } χ 2 k − 1 . 36 Thus , MSB MA = (cid:80) ki = 1 { n ( y i − ¯ y ) 2 } / ( k − 1 ) is distributed with { nτ 2 + σ 2pop } χ 2 k − 1 / ( k − 1 ) . Since ( n − 1 ) n ˆ σ 2 y i follow distributions σ 2pop χ 2 n − 1 and are independent of each other for i = 1 , . . . , k , MSW MA ∼ σ 2pop χ 2 k ( n − 1 ) / { k ( n − 1 ) } . Derivation of ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) . With Lemma 1 , E ( MSB MA − MSW MA ) = ¯ nτ 2 , and E { MSB MA + ( ¯ n − 1 ) MSW MA } = ¯ n ( τ 2 + σ 2pop ) . Thus , ICC MA = τ 2 / ( τ 2 + σ 2pop ) can be estimated by ( MSB MA − MSW MA ) / { MSB MA + ( ¯ n − 1 ) MSW MA } . Truncating the negative value to zero , the I 2A statistic in ( 11 ) can be derived . Denote F k − 1 , k ( ¯ n − 1 ) by the F distribution with k − 1 and k ( ¯ n − 1 ) degrees of freedom . Let F α be the ( 100 α ) th percentile of F k − 1 , k ( ¯ n − 1 ) and ¯ F MA = MSB MA / MSW MA . Then with Lemma 2 , under the balanced case , σ 2pop / ( ¯ nτ 2 + σ 2pop ) · ¯ F MA is distributed with F k − 1 , k ( ¯ n − 1 ) . We have 1 − α = Pr (cid:18) F α / 2 ≤ σ 2pop ¯ nτ 2 + σ 2pop ¯ F MA ≤ F 1 − α / 2 (cid:19) = Pr (cid:18) ¯ F MA / F 1 − α / 2 ≤ ¯ nτ 2 + σ 2pop σ 2pop ≤ ¯ F MA / F α / 2 (cid:19) = Pr (cid:26) 1 ¯ n (cid:0) ¯ F MA / F 1 − α / 2 − 1 (cid:1) ≤ τ 2 σ 2pop ≤ 1 ¯ n (cid:0) ¯ F MA / F α / 2 − 1 (cid:1)(cid:27) . For the left inequality , Pr (cid:26) 1 ¯ n (cid:0) ¯ F MA / F 1 − α / 2 − 1 (cid:1) ≤ τ 2 σ 2pop (cid:27) = Pr (cid:26) 1 ¯ n (cid:0) ¯ F MA / F 1 − α / 2 − 1 (cid:1) ≤ 0 (cid:27) + Pr (cid:18) τ 2 + σ 2pop τ 2 ≤ ¯ n + ¯ F MA / F 1 − α / 2 − 1 ¯ F MA / F 1 − α / 2 − 1 (cid:19) = Pr (cid:18) ¯ F MA / F 1 − α / 2 − 1 ¯ n + ¯ F MA / F 1 − α / 2 − 1 ≤ τ 2 τ 2 + σ 2pop (cid:19) . For the right inequality , Pr (cid:26) τ 2 σ 2pop ≤ 1 ¯ n (cid:0) ¯ F MA / F α / 2 − 1 (cid:1)(cid:27) = Pr (cid:26) 1 ¯ n (cid:0) ¯ F MA / F α / 2 − 1 (cid:1) > 0 , ¯ n + ¯ F MA / F α / 2 − 1 ¯ F MA / F α / 2 − 1 ≤ τ 2 + σ 2pop τ 2 (cid:27) = Pr (cid:18) τ 2 τ 2 + σ 2pop ≤ ¯ F MA / F α / 2 − 1 ¯ n + ¯ F MA / F α / 2 − 1 (cid:19) . 37 Thus , the 100 ( 1 − α ) % confidence interval for ICC MA is (cid:20) ¯ F MA / F 1 − α / 2 − 1 ¯ n + ¯ F MA / F 1 − α / 2 − 1 , ¯ F MA / F α / 2 − 1 ¯ n + ¯ F MA / F α / 2 − 1 (cid:21) . The confidence interval in ( 12 ) is derived by truncating the negative values of the above limits to zero . Appendix D The derivation of the I 2A statistic for the mean difference To generalize the I 2 A statistic to mean difference , we also start with modeling the individual patient data in a single study . In analogy with model ( 4 ) , we model the individual observations y Tij and y Cij ′ of the treatment group and the control group for the i th study as y Tij = µ T + δ Ti + ξ Tij , j = 1 , . . . , n Ti , y Cij ′ = µ C + δ Ci + ξ Cij ′ , j ′ = 1 , . . . , n Ci , where the superscript “T” represents the treatment group , and the superscript “C” repre - sents the control group . Similar to the assumptions in model ( 4 ) , we assume that δ Ti , ξ Tij ′ , δ Ci and ξ Cij ′ are independent of each other . For the random errors of different observations in the same study , it is natural to assume they are i . i . d . normal random errors with mean 0 and share a common variance σ 2 . Then the true effect size for each study is routinely presented by the mean difference MD i = ( µ T + δ Ti ) − ( µ C + δ Ci ) . For each study , the observed mean difference is y Ti − y Ci = ( µ T − µ C ) + ( δ Ti − δ Ci ) + ( (cid:80) n Ti j = 1 ξ ij n Ti − (cid:80) n Ci j ′ = 1 ξ ij n Ci ) , ( 17 ) where y T i = (cid:80) n T j = 1 ξ ij / n Ti , and y Ci = (cid:80) n C j = 1 ξ ij / n C i . Further , let y i = y T i − y C i , µ = µ T − µ C , δ i = δ Ti − δ Ci , and ϵ i = (cid:80) n Ti j = 1 ξ ij / n Ti − (cid:80) n Ci j ′ = 1 ξ ij / n Ci . Regardless of the dependence between 38 δ Ti and δ Ci , we simply assume that δ i are i . i . d . normal random variables with mean 0 and variance τ 2 ≥ 0 , where τ 2 measures the magnitude of the heterogeneity between studies . Then model ( 17 ) reduces to y i = µ + δ i + ϵ i , ( 18 ) where δ i i . i . d . ∼ N ( 0 , τ 2 ) and ϵ i ind ∼ N ( 0 , ( 1 / n Ti + 1 / n Ci ) σ 2 ) . We note that model ( 18 ) has the same form as in ( 5 ) , except for the variance of ϵ i . To estimate ICC MA for the mean difference , we apply the results for the single - arm studies directly . Letting n i = 1 / ( 1 / n Ti + 1 / n Ci ) , Lemma 1 in Appendix Appendix B also holds that E ( MSB MA ) = ¯ nτ 2 + σ 2 , E ( MSW MA ) = σ 2 . Together with the notation of ¯ n , the I 2A statistic in ( 11 ) can be derived . Appendix E The derivation of the I 2A statistic for the standardized mean difference For the standardized mean difference , we model the individual observations y Tij and y Cij ′ of the treatment group and the control group for the i th study as y Tij = σ i ( µ T + δ Ti + ξ Tij ) , j = 1 , . . . , n Ti , y Cij ′ = σ i ( µ C + δ Ci + ξ Cij ′ ) , j ′ = 1 , . . . , n Ci , where the superscript “T” represents the treatment group , and the superscript “C” rep - resents the control group . Similar to the assumptions in model ( 4 ) , we assume that δ Ti , ξ Tij ′ , δ Ci and ξ Cij ′ are independent of each other . In ( ipdsmd ) , ξ Tij ′ and ξ Cij ′ are assumed to be i . i . d . normal random errors with mean 0 and variance 1 . Then with different values of σ i , the population variances for different studies are σ 2 i , respectively . To eliminate the influence of the scale , SMDs are considered to represent the effect sizes , which is defined by SMD i = { ( σ i µ T + σ i δ Ti ) − ( σ i µ C + σ i δ Ci ) } / σ i = ( µ T + δ Ti ) − ( µ C + δ Ci ) . 39 For each study , SMD i is estimated by y Ti − y Ci ˆ σ i = σ i ˆ σ i { ( µ T − µ C ) + ( δ Ti − δ Ci ) + ( (cid:80) n Ti j = 1 ξ ij n Ti − (cid:80) n Ci j ′ = 1 ξ ij n Ci ) } , ( 19 ) where ˆ σ i is an estimate for σ i , y Ti = (cid:80) n T j = 1 ξ ij / n Ti , and y Ci = (cid:80) n C j = 1 ξ ij / n Ci . For simplicity , we assume that σ i can be accurately estimated and thus σ i / ˆ σ i = 1 . Further , let y i = y Ti − y Ci , µ = µ T − µ C , δ i = δ Ti − δ Ci , and ϵ i = (cid:80) n Ti j = 1 ξ ij / n Ti − (cid:80) n Ci j ′ = 1 ξ ij / n Ci . Regardless of the dependence between δ Ti and δ Ci , we simply assume that δ i are i . i . d . normal random variables with mean 0 and variance τ 2 ≥ 0 , where τ 2 measures the magnitude of the heterogeneity between studies . Then model ( 19 ) reduces to y i = µ + δ i + ϵ i , ( 20 ) where δ i i . i . d . ∼ N ( 0 , τ 2 ) and ϵ i ind ∼ N ( 0 , 1 / n Ti + 1 / n Ci ) . We note that model ( 20 ) has the same form as in ( 5 ) , except for the variance of ϵ i . To estimate ICC MA for the mean difference , we also apply the results for the single - arm studies directly . Letting n i = 1 / ( 1 / n Ti + 1 / n Ci ) , Lemma 1 in Appendix Appendix B also holds that E ( MSB MA ) = ¯ nτ 2 + 1 . Together with the notation of ¯ n and MSB MA = 1 , the I 2A statistic in ( 11 ) can be derived . 40
