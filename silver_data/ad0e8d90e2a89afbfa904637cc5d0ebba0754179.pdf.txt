Sabatini , New York University School of Medicine , New York , NY , and approved March 15 , 2012 ( received for review October 21 , 2011 ) A long - standing paradigm in cell biology is the shutdown of endocytosis during mitosis . There is consensus that transferrin uptake is inhibited after entry into prophase and that it resumes in telophase . A recent study proposed that endocytosis is continuous throughout the cell cycle and that the observed inhibition of transferrin uptake is due to a decrease in available transferrin receptor at the cell surface , and not to a shutdown of endocytosis . This challenge to the established view is gradually becoming accepted . Because of this controversy , we revisited the question of endocytic activity during mitosis . Using an antibody uptake assay and controlling for potential changes in surface receptor density , we demonstrate the strong inhibition of endocytosis in mitosis of CD8 chimeras containing any of the three major internalization motifs for clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( YXX Φ , [ DE ] XXXL [ LI ] , or FXNPXY ) or a CD8 protein with the cytoplasmic tail of the cation - independent mannose 6 - phosphate receptor . The shutdown is not gradual : We describe a binary switch from endocytosis being “ on ” in interphase to “ off ” in mitosis as cells traverse the G 2 / M check - point . In addition , we show that the inhibition of transferrin up - take in mitosis occurs despite abundant transferrin receptor at the surface of HeLa cells . Our study ﬁ nds no support for the recent idea that endocytosis continues during mitosis , and we conclude that endocytosis is temporarily shutdown during early mitosis . cell division | moonlighting | receptor traf ﬁ cking | endosomal recycling | prometaphase C lathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is important for diverse processes such as cell signaling , nutrient uptake , and cell motility ( 1 ) . Receptors destined for CME become concentrated in clathrin - coated pits at the cell surface where they bind to adap - tor proteins and , hence , clathrin via speci ﬁ c endocytic motifs present in their cytoplasmic tails ( 2 ) . A long - standing tenet in cell biology is the shutdown of en - docytosis during mitosis . Nearly 50 years ago , the separation of ferritin - containing coated vesicles from the plasma membrane was found to be inhibited during cell division ( 3 ) . Subsequently , suppression of a broad range of endocytic processes was ob - served during mitosis ( 4 ) . Quanti ﬁ cation of this phenomenon revealed a 30 - fold decrease in ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis , a process that is largely attributable to CME ( 5 ) , which occurred within 30 s of entry into prophase ( 6 ) . Further studies demonstrated that uptake of ﬂ uorescent dextran ceases during mitosis and also con ﬁ rmed the timing of shutdown to be in early prophase ( 7 ) . Many other studies went on to con ﬁ rm and further develop the theory of mitotic shutdown of endocytosis , showing that it is temporary and resumes in telophase ( 8 – 17 ) . The reason for shutdown is unclear ( 18 , 19 ) , but one recent idea is that “ moonlighting ” functions for endocytic proteins during mitosis may contribute to the inhibition ( 20 , 21 ) . Despite this wealth of evidence , a recent report suggested that CME is , in fact , normal throughout all phases of cell division ( 22 ) . The authors suggested that the amount of plasma mem - brane decreases at the beginning of mitosis and then increases during anaphase and telophase , with complete recovery before abscission ( 22 , 23 ) . It was proposed that this phenomenon could occur if CME is continuous throughout cell division , whereas recycling of internalized membranes back to the cell surface is slowed considerably at the beginning of mitosis and reactivated in anaphase , leading to plasma membrane recovery ( 22 ) . What made this study so compelling was that it argued that previous results describing endocytic shutdown had been misinterpreted . For example , as in many other studies , the authors described a reduction in transferrin uptake in mitotic cells , being lowest at metaphase ( 22 ) . However , measurements of surface - bound transferrin showed an even larger decrease indicating that the endocytic rate is actually increased , not decreased , during mitosis ( 22 ) . It was suggested that the relative amount of receptors at the surface had not been accounted for , leading to a misinterpre - tation of the results . In addition , a recent report using a similar methodology showed an increase in endocytosis of some , but not all , chimeric myc - tagged TGF - β type I receptors during mitosis ( 24 ) . Despite relatively little evidence , the idea that endocytosis is continuous throughout mitosis seems to be becoming estab - lished ( 21 , 25 – 27 ) . Becauseofthiscontroversy , wesetouttoreexamine endocytosis during cell division . Because transferrin receptor ( TfR ) surface levelsmayvarybetweendifferentstagesof thecellcycle ( 7 , 22 ) and also between different cell lines ( 7 ) , transferrin uptake measure - ments may be dif ﬁ cult to interpret . We therefore used an alter - native reporter of CME , the CD8 chimera system ( 28 – 30 ) . We found that endocytosis is severely reduced during mitosis for all of the endocytic motifs examined , with cells rapidly transitioning from possessing full endocytic activity to only minimal levels as cells go into mitosis . We also show that , in HeLa cells , transferrin uptake is severely reduced despite surface receptor levels remain - ingnormalthroughoutmitosis . Ourresultsarguethatthetheoryof endocytic shutdown during mitosis is correct . Results Endocytosis Is Strongly Inhibited During Mitosis . To characterize the endocytosis of proteins with a range of important endocytic motifs , we used the well - described CD8 chimera system ( 28 – 31 ) . This system comprises a set of constructs , each with the extra - cellular and transmembrane domain of CD8 α - chain , with vary - ing cytosolic domains . Brie ﬂ y , CD8 WT ( CD8 - WT ) contains no known sorting signals in its cytoplasmic tail , is therefore not subject to endocytosis and is resident at the plasma membrane ( 28 ) . CD8 - cation – independent mannose 6 - phosphate receptor ( CIMPR ) contains the cytoplasmic domain of CIMPR , a well - characterized cargo that is ef ﬁ ciently internalized in clathrin - coated vesicles before being traf ﬁ cked to the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) and a subset of late endosomes , via sorting and recycling endosomes ( 32 , 33 ) . The remaining constructs contain “ designer ” tails that represent three well - established endocytic motifs : YXX Φ ( CD8 - YAAL ) , [ DE ] XXXL [ LI ] ( CD8 - EAAALL ) , and FXNPXY ( CD8 - FANPAY ) , all transposed on a background of eight alanines ( CD8 - 8xA ) ( 28 ) . To study endocytosis in mitotic cells , we ﬁ rst used a ﬂ ow cytometry - based antibody uptake assay that allowed us to Author contributions : S . J . R . designed research ; A . B . F . , A . K .

In this assay , cells are incubated with Alexa488 - conjugated anti - CD8 at 37 °C for 40 min to label any CD8 that is internal - ized in this time . Cells are then shifted to 4 °C to prevent uptake , and plasma membrane CD8 ﬂ uorescence is ﬁ rst quenched with an anti - Alexa488 antibody and then relabeled with an anti - mouse Alexa633 antibody before ﬁ xation and analysis by ﬂ ow cytometry ( 28 ) . Thus , measuring green ﬂ uorescence from cells displaying similar far - red ﬂ uorescence ( surface ) allows quanti ﬁ cation of in - ternalized CD8 ( Fig . 1 A ) . Cells transfected with the set of CD8 constructs were synchro - nizedatvariousstagesofthecellcycle ; ininterphasebyarrestingin S phase using thymidine , at the G 2 / M checkpoint using RO - 3306 ( 34 ) , or in mitosis by 30 - min release from RO - 3306 or arrest using nocodazole . In addition , hypertonic sucrose , which inhibits en - docytosis ( 35 ) , was used as a control to represent endocytic block . Fig . 1 B shows example ﬂ ow cytometry plots of interphase ( thy - midine treated ) , mitotic ( RO - 3306 , 30 - min release ) , and sucrose - treated interphase cells . Under all conditions , CD8 - WT and CD8 - 8xA display the same pro ﬁ le , with cells expressing CD8 at their surface and showing essentially no uptake of CD8 ( Fig . 1 B ) . Cells expressing higher amounts of CD8 - WT or CD8 - 8xA at the surface show some green ﬂ uorescence , which is probably due to inef ﬁ cient quenching of surface anti – CD8 - Alexa488 ( 28 ) . Cells in interphase expressing CD8 chimeras with internalization motifs display a markedly different pro ﬁ le ( Fig . 1 B , Top ) . In these cells , high levels of internalized ﬂ uorescence are apparent at moderate levels of surface expression , indicating CME . By contrast , cells in mitosis expressing CD8 chimeras containing endocytic motifs display a similar distribution as CD - WT or CD8 - 8xA cells ( Fig . 1 B , Mid - dle ) , with very little internalization . These pro ﬁ les can be com - pared with those from interphase cells where endocytosis has been inhibited using hypertonic sucrose ( Fig . 1 B , Bottom ) . This result indicates endocytosis of these constructs is strongly inhibited during mitosis . Toquantify these data , events were gatedtoselectcells expressing similar , moderate surface CD8 levels ( Fig . 1 C ) , as described ( 28 ) . Antibody uptake , normalized to CD8 - YAAL expressing , thymidine - arrested cells , was then plotted for each of the constructs ( Fig . 1 D ) . As expected , in interphase , cells expressing constructs with inter - nalization motifs showed robust internalization compared with CD8 - WT and CD8 - 8xA . However , mitotic cells showed an essen - tially complete inhibition of internalization , because the average green ﬂ uorescence was reduced to the same levels as CD - WT or CD8 - 8xA ( Fig . 1 D ) . Endocytic Shutdown in Mitosis Is a Binary Event . Although mitotic cells showed an inhibition of internalization down to CD8 - WT or CD8 - 8xA levels , it was noted that cells treated with , but not re - leased from , RO - 3306 before the antibody uptake assay ( RO - 3306 no release ) showed uptake but that it was signi ﬁ cantly lower than cells in S phase ( Fig . 1 D ) . This observation could mean that cells at the G 2 / M boundary show a reduced but not complete inhibition of mitosis , perhaps suggesting a slowing down of endocytosis as cells approach mitosis . Alternatively , these data could be explained by Fig . 1 . Internalization of CD8 chimeras is strongly inhibited in mitosis .

Cells were released from a thymidine block and the anti – CD8 - Alexa488 uptake assay performed in the presence of nocodazole , RO - 3306 or sucrose . Fielding et al .

This possibility could be accounted for by the release of a portion of the cells from the G 2 / M block into mitosis during the time course of the antibody uptake assay . To investigate this ob - servation , the gated ﬂ ow cytometry events for thymidine and RO - 3306 0 - or 30 - min release were plotted as histograms for com - parison ( Fig . 1 E ) . In CD8 - WT or CD8 - 8xA cells , the same single peak is observed in all three conditions , indicating no uptake re - gardless of cell cycle stage . In thymidine - treated cells expressing CD8 - CIMPR , CD8 - YAAL , CD8 - EAAALL , and CD8 - FANPAY , a single peak at high green ﬂ uorescence intensity is observed , representing internalized CD8 . At 30 - min release from RO - 3306 , this peak is shifted to the left , indicating the inhibition of endo - cytosis . However , the RO - 3306 0 - min release shows two distinct peaks , one overlaying with the thymidine peak and the second with the 30 - min release from RO - 3306 peak ( Fig . 1 E ) . This result indicates that this sample is a mixed population of cells , each showing binary responses , and the observed decrease in Fig . 1 D wasnotdueto partialendocytic shutdown inlate G 2 , butratherthe average result of a sample containing cells at the G 2 / M border with interphase levels of endocytosis and a mitotic population with inhibited endocytosis . We interpret this result to mean that en - docytosis is under binary control by the cell cycle : It is either on in interphase or off during early mitosis . We next tested whether the observed inhibition of endocytosis was due to the stage in the cell cycle or if the drugs used for synchronization caused the observed endocytic defects . Accord - ingly , we transiently treated interphase - synchronized cells with either nocodazole or RO - 3306 and performed the antibody up - take assay ( Fig . 1 F ) . Internalization of the CD8 constructs was not affected by transient treatment with either nocodazole or RO - 3306 , demonstrating that the effects observed in Fig . 1 D were due to the cell cycle stage of the cells and not an effect of the small molecules per se . Mitotic Inhibition of Endocytosis Was Con ﬁ rmed Using Fluorescence Microscopy . The ﬂ ow cytometry assay of CD8 traf ﬁ cking was carried out on synchronized cells in suspension . To verify our observations , we next used the same labeling protocol ( Fig . 1 A ) on asynchronous HeLa cells grown on coverslips and visualized the cells by confocal microscopy . Internalization was evident at interphase for CD8 - CIMPR , CD8 - YAAL , CD8 - EAAALL , and CD8 - FANPAY , but not for CD8 - WT and CD8 - 8xA ( Fig . 2 A ) . In mitosis , virtually no internalization was seen for any CD8 con - struct . In all conditions , good surface expression was detected ( Fig . 2 A and Fig . S1 ) . These data con ﬁ rm that there is no ap - preciable uptake of CD8 constructs in mitotic cells . So far , our CD8 experiments were carried out with a single labeling time point ( 40 min ) . It is possible , but rather unlikely , that internalization can occur , but it is not detected because of rapid recycling . To visualize whether internalization occurs at all , we imaged living HeLa cells expressing the CD8 constructs and applied Alexa488 - conjugated anti - CD8 to monitor endocytosis . Again , uptake was seen for CD8 constructs with internalization signals during interphase but not during early mitosis . Example frames from these experiments are shown for CD8 - YAAL and CD8 - FANPAY ( Fig . 2 B ) . CD8 at the cell surface was intensely stained during this procedure , indicating that the lack of in - ternalization was due to inhibition of endocytosis and not due to problems in surface labeling . To further verify our results , we next determined the steady - state subcellular localization of the transfected CD8 chimeric constructs in interphase and mitotic cells ( Fig . 2 C ) . Cells were ﬁ xed , permeabilized , and stained with the Alexa488 - conjugated anti - CD8 antibody and 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) . The localization of all of the constructs in interphase recapitulated the results of the antibody uptake experiments . CD8 - WT and CD8 - 8xA were almost exclusively localized at the plasma mem - brane , whereas CD8 - CIMPR , CD8 - YAAL , CD8 - EAAALL , and CD8 - FANPAY were all resident in intracellular puncta and / or perinuclear compartments , with little plasma membrane staining . However , in mitotic cells , CD8 - YAAL , CD8 - EAAALL , and CD8 - FANPAY were now predominately localized at the plasma membrane , with little intracellular ﬂ uorescence . The CD8 - CIMPR chimera had a substantial intracellular pool in mitotic cells . This pool is likely due to different traf ﬁ cking routes . Al - though proteinscontainingYXX Φ , [ D / E ] XXXL [ L / I ] , orFXNPXY motifs typically show rapid recycling back to the plasma membrane after internalization , a proportion of CIMPR also traf ﬁ cs to the TGN and late endosomes ( 33 ) . Recycling from here to the plasma membrane will necessarily take more time . Therefore , intracellular CD8 - CIMPR that is present in mitotic cells was probably in - ternalized before mitotic entry . Taken together , these results sug - gest that the dynamics of clathrin - coated vesicle internalization are dramaticallyalteredduringmitosis . Moreover , theycon ﬁ rmthatthe lack of CD8 uptake in mitosis is due to endocytic shutdown and not due to a decrease of the population of receptors at the plasma membrane , as argued ( 22 ) . Transferrin Uptake Is Reduced in Mitotic Cells Despite Abundant Surface TfR . There is consensus that transferrin uptake is inhibi - ted during mitosis ( for example , refs . 11 , 15 , 22 , 36 , and 37 ) . Fig . 2 .

However , it was contended recently that this inhibition is not due to endocytic shutdown but is instead due to a reduction in TfRs at the surface ( 22 ) . We next investigated the internalization of endogenous TfRs in HeLa cells during interphase and mitosis . First , we measured by ﬂ ow cytometry the uptake of Alexa488 - conjugated transferrin in synchronized HeLa cells ( Fig . 3 A ) . These experiments once again con ﬁ rmed that uptake of trans - ferrin is inhibited during mitosis . Second , the uptake of Alexa488 transferrin was followed by labeling of surface TfRs with Alexa647 transferrin at 4 °C . Here , mitotic cells showed similar surface labeling to interphase cells suggesting that the lack of uptake during mitosis is not due to a decrease in TfRs at the cell surface ( Fig . S2 ) . To con ﬁ rm these observations by an alternative approach , we labeled the endogenous TfR by using a similar protocol to that used for the CD8 experiments ( Materials and Methods ) . In these experiments , the ratio of labeled TfRs that were internalized versus those on the surface was decreased signi ﬁ cantly in mitotic cells compared with those in interphase ( Fig . 3 B ) . This ratio was comparable to blockade of CME in interphase cells by using hypertonic sucrose . Importantly , the level of TfR at the surface of mitotic cells was not reduced compared with interphase cells , as suggested ( Fig . 3 C ) . Inhibition of TfR Endocytosis During Early Mitosis Observed Using Fluorescence Microscopy . We next veri ﬁ ed our ﬂ ow cytometry measurements of TfR traf ﬁ cking by using asynchronous HeLa cells on coverslips and confocal microscopy . Cells were in - cubated with Alexa488 - labeled transferrin at 4 ° C before being shifted to 37 ° C for 7 min to allow potential uptake . Cells were then acid - washed to remove surface - bound transferrin before ﬁ xation and subsequent staining with anti - TfR antibody , without cell permeabilization . Full Z - series of interphase or mitotic cells were captured , and the total ﬂ uorescence was quanti ﬁ ed ( Fig . 4 A ) . The amount of internalized transferrin was signi ﬁ cantly reduced in mitotic cells compared with those in interphase , whereas the amount of surface TfR was signi ﬁ cantly increased . Again , we found that the ratio of internalized transferrin versus the surface TfR was signi ﬁ cantly reduced during mitosis ( Fig . 4 A Inset ) . Once more , these experiments verify that the inhibition of transferrin uptake seen during mitosis by all investigators is not due to a reduction in TfRs at the cell surface . To examine the mitotic shutdown of endocytosis and its sub - sequent recovery , cells were labeled as above and imaged at different stages of mitosis . Fig . 4 B and Fig . S3 show that al - though transferrin was readily internalized in interphase cells , prometaphase , metaphase , and anaphase cells displayed a marked decrease in uptake . However , in the same cells , TfR staining remained abundant at the cell surface throughout all stages of cell division , being at least as pronounced as in neighboring interphase cells visible in the same ﬁ eld . This experiment suggests that , in HeLa cells , TfR availability at the cell surface cannot be a limiting factor for endocytosis at any stage of the cell cycle . In cells that have progressed to telophase and cytokinesis , robust uptake is apparent ( Fig . 4 B ) . These data indicate that the mitotic shutdown of endocytosis occurs during early mitosis , peaking at prom - etaphase and metaphase . How is CME shut down during early mitosis ? CME is a multi - step pathway , and so we looked at what stage the process might be inhibited to inform future work . The colocalization of TfRs and clathrin was assessed in mitotic cells by using confocal microscopy . TfRs at the cell surface could clearly be seen to colocalize with clathrin puncta ( Fig . 4 C ) . These puncta likely correspond to cla - thrin - coated pits that are arrested ( 8 ) . These observations suggest that the inhibition occurs at a comparatively late stage of CME . Receptors on the surface of mitotic cells are able to engage adaptorsandtoconcentrateinpitsbutthattheinvaginationand / or progression of pits into vesicles is inhibited speci ﬁ cally . Having con ﬁ rmed that CME is shut down during mitosis , we wonderedwhetherthisregulationisspeci ﬁ ctoCMEorwhetherall forms of constitutive endocytosis are inhibited . Accordingly , we labeled the plasma membrane of live cells by using 15 μ M FM4 - 64 for 10 min . Excess dye was washed from the plasma membrane with constant perfusion for 10 min , and any uptake of labeled membrane was then visualized by ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( Fig . 4 D ) . In interphase cells , many bright puncta were observed , sug - gesting robust internalization of plasma membrane . By contrast , neighboring mitotic cells showed very few , if any , intracellular puncta , indicating that general uptake of plasma membrane is substantially decreased in mitotic cells . These experiments pro - vide a further indication of reduced endocytic activity during mi - tosis . In addition , this assay is independent of receptor availability at the plasma membrane and suggests that all forms of constitutive endocytosis are shut down during mitosis . Discussion A long - established concept in cell biology is the shutdown of en - docytosis during mitosis ( for reviews , see refs . 18 and 38 ) . How - ever , this idea was challenged recently by two studies that reported endocytosis to be normal throughout all phases of cell division ( 22 , 24 ) . These studies argued that because potential changes in sur - face receptor number may not have been controlled for , previous work showing that uptake was inhibited during mitosis could have been misinterpreted ( 22 ) . This argument was compelling , and a new view — that endocytosis continues during mitosis — was fast becoming established ( 21 , 25 – 27 ) . Here , we revisited this question by using a variety of approaches and found no evidence for continued endocytosis during mitosis . Our methods allowed us to monitor the number of receptors at the cell surface , and we did not detect a decrease duringearly mitosis . If anything , thenumber ofreceptors atthesurface ofmitotic cells may actually be increased , and so it is highly unlikely that the mitotic inhibition of uptake , which is undisputed , is due to unavailability of receptors at the cell surface . Instead , our results , supported by de - Fig . 3 . Transferrin uptake and endocytosis of endogenous transferrin receptors ( TfRs ) is inhibited during mitosis despite abundant surface TfR .

PNAS | April 24 , 2012 | vol . 109 | no . 17 | 6575 C E LL B I O L O G Y cades of previous work , point de ﬁ nitively to a direct inhibition of the process of endocytosis during early mitosis . We initially used the CD8 reporter system and ﬂ ow cytometry , which allowed us to control for the surface population of receptors and only analyze cells with similar , moderate amounts of CD8 at the cell surface . In brief , we found that CD8 - CIMPR or CD8 constructs with any one of three endocytic motifs ( YXX Φ , [ D / E ] XXXL [ L / I ] , or FXNPXY ) were internalized during inter - phase but not during early mitosis . In fact , mitotic uptake of these proteins was comparable to that of CD8 - WT or CD8 - 8xA , which are unable to be internalized . Moreover , the degree of shutdown was similar to inhibition of endocytosis in interphase cells by using hypertonic sucrose treatment ( 35 ) . Similar results were obtained by microscopy using adherent cells that were growing asynchro - nously . In fact , the subcellular distributions of the CD8 constructs indicated that a large proportion of the CD8 chimeras that contain endocytic motifs was localized at the plasma membrane at steady - state during mitosis , again indicating that endocytosis is shut down during mitosis . Analysis of the dynamics of endocytic shutdown revealed that CME is , at least with our temporal resolution , essentially a bi - nary event . It is at normal levels at the end of G 2 , yet completely inhibited during early mitosis . This observation supports pre - vious work that described endocytic shutdown occurring rapidly after cells enter prophase ( 6 , 7 ) . The speed at which endocytosis decreases does not support the hypothesis that membrane area could be reduced by 50 % or more as cells enter mitosis ( 22 ) . As the cell rounds up on mitotic entry , the cytoplasmic volume is decreased ( 23 , 39 , 40 ) , but there is not a clear consensus on any change in the surface area of the plasma membrane . Several studies have variously reported a decrease ( 22 ) , an increase ( 41 ) , or no change in cell surface area ( 39 , 42 , 43 ) . Accurate mea - surement of cell surface area by low - resolution light microscopy ( 22 ) is not straightforward because the plasma membrane in mitotic cells is puckered ( 39 , 42 , 43 ) . Interestingly , our live cell anti - CD8 labeling experiments ( Fig . 2 B ) highlighted the signi ﬁ - cant amount of plasma membrane surrounding the retraction ﬁ bers that hold the cell to the coverslip ( 44 ) . We speculate that this membrane may not have been accounted for in previous work ( 22 ) . Cell rounding in mitosis is primarily driven by osmotic changes with a contribution by the actomyosin cell cortex ( 40 ) . Although the later stages of cell division ( e . g . , cytokinesis ) clearly involve massive membrane remodeling , this situation need not be the case in early mitosis when endocytosis is shut down . To further con ﬁ rm the shutdown of endocytosis during early mitosis , we also tested the endogenous TfR . As expected , the re - ceptor , which contains a YXX Φ sorting motif was regulated in the same way as the CD8 - YAAL reporter . Our transferrin uptake experiments con ﬁ rmed many previous reports of reduced trans - ferrinuptakeduringmitosis ( 7 , 11 , 15 , 22 , 36 , 37 ) . Stainingofsurface TfR indicated that it was abundant at the cell surface during all stages of the cell cycle in HeLa cells . Mitotic A431 cells display re - duced staining of TfR at the cell surface compared with interphase cells , although the same study reported a less marked reduction in HeLa cells ( 7 ) . The availability of TfR at the surface of HeLa cells indicates that the observed decrease in transferrin uptake is not due to a lack of TfR in this cell type , as suggested ( 22 ) . Therefore , the most likely explanation of this result is a decrease in endocytosis during prometaphase , metaphase , and anaphase ( 7 , 15 ) . What seems clear from this study and the many preceding it , is that constitutive endocytosis is de ﬁ nitely inhibited during early mitosis . So are there any cases where endocytosis can occur during mitosis ? In some specialized cases , there is good evidence for an override mechanism . For example , the atypical cadherin Celsr1 , which is internalized to maintain an asymmetric distri - bution at the plasma membrane ( 45 ) . This protein uses a di - leucine sorting motif for internalization , and this phenomenon seems to be particular to this planar cell polarity component . Another example is the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , which can be internalized in mitotic cells in a ligand - dependent manner , albeit after a long delay ( 37 ) . In contrast to EGFR in - ternalization in interphase cells , mitotic uptake of EGFR was shown to be kinase - dependent and clathrin - independent ( 37 ) . Al - though the nature of potential override mechanisms needs further investigation , this work should follow on from the more funda - mental question of how and why constitutive endocytosis is halted during cell division ; a full molecular picture of which still remains to be elucidated . Understanding how the cell regulates constitutive endocytosis is important because if mitotic shutdown can be mim - icked pharmacologically in interphase cells , infection of cells by pathogens using this entry pathway may be preventable .

( Scale bars : 10 μ m . ) 6576 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1117401109 Fielding et al . Materials and Methods Cell Culture and Reagents . HeLa cells were grown in DMEM containing 10 % ( vol / vol ) FBS and penicillin / streptomycin at 37 °C / 5 % CO 2 . CD8 chimera cDNA constructs ( 28 ) were a kind gift from Scottie Robinson ( University of Cam - bridge , Cambridge , United Kingdom ) . H2B - GFP , H2B - mCherry , and GFP - LCa were available from previous work ( 36 ) . Flow Cytometry . Analysis of surface and internalized CD8 was performed as described ( 28 ) . HeLa cells expressing CD8 constructs were synchronized in S phase with 2 mM thymidine for 18 h , at the G 2 / M checkpoint with 9 μ M RO - 3306 for 18 h ( 34 ) and in M - phase either by 30 - min release from RO - 3306 treatment or with 40 ng / mL nocodazole for 16 h . Thymidine and RO - 3306 arrested cells were trypsinized , whereas cells in mitosis ( nocodazole - arrested or those released for 30 min from RO - 3306 block ) were gently isolated by shake - off . For endocytic block , interphase ( thymidine ) cells were incubated with hypertonic sucrose ( 0 . 45 M ) during the uptake assay ( 35 ) . For analysis of transferrin uptake , synchronized cells were suspended , serum - starved for 30 min , then incubated with 50 μ g / mL Alexa488 - conju - gated transferrin for 5 min at 4 °C , then moved to 37 °C and incubated for 10 min . Cells were pelleted , washed in ice cold 1 % BSA / PBS , acid - washed twice , and ﬁ xed before ﬂ ow cytometric analysis . Analysis of internalized and surface TfR was performed by using a similar method to CD8 labeling . For each sample , 1 × 10 4 events were acquired and geometric means with no gating ( or > 1 × 10 3 events after gating for CD8 experiments ) fromthreeindependentexperimentswereusedforcomparison . Immuno ﬂ uorescence and Live - Cell Labeling . Immuno ﬂ uorescence was as de - scribed ( 36 ) , before mounting in Mowiol containing 10 μ g / mL DAPI . For immuno ﬂ uorescence analysis of the CD8 uptake assay , asynchronous HeLa cells on coverslips were labeled as above , except Alexa568 - conjugated anti - mouse IgG secondary was used to label the surface CD8 . For live - cell imaging of CD8 uptake , cells were synchronized by using RO - 3306 as above , released for 25 min then transferred to CO 2 - independent media and a 37 °C , humidi ﬁ ed microscope chamber . Cells in prometaphase or metaphase were identi ﬁ ed by H2B - mCherry . Alexa488 - conjugated anti - CD8 antibody was then added at 1 : 100 dilution in CO 2 - independent media , and images were acquired every 30 s for 30 min . For transferrin uptake experiments , the cells were serum - starved for 45 min at 37 °C in DMEM . Cells were incubated on ice for 5 min followed by addition of 50 μ g / mL Alexa488 - conjugated transferrin ( Invitrogen ) in DMEM . After 30 min on ice , cells were transferred to 37 °C for 7 min , then acid - washed ( 0 . 1 M glycine and 150 mM NaCl at pH 3 ) before ﬁ xation ( wt / vol 3 % paraformaldehyde and 4 % sucrose in PBS ) . Subsequently , cells were stained with rabbit anti - TfR ( CBL47 ; Chemicon ) followed by anti - rabbit Alexa568 secondary ( 1 : 500 , Invitrogen ) . For FM4 - 64 uptake experiments , HeLa cells expressing H2B - GFP were in - cubated with FM4 - 64 ( 15 μ M ; Invitrogen ) for 10 min . Excess dye was washed by using normal extracellular solution ( 136 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 1 . 3 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM Hepes , 2 mM CaCl 2 , and 10 mM glucose at pH 7 . 4 ) for 10 min .

HeLa cells were grown in DMEM containing 10 % ( vol / vol ) FBS and penicillin / streptomycin at 37 ° C and 5 % CO 2 . Transfections were carried out according to manufacturer ’ s instructions by using either GeneJuice ( Novagen ) or Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) . The CD8 - chimera con - structs ( 1 ) were a kind gift from Scottie Robinson ( University of Cambridge , Cambridge , United Kingdom ) . The amino acid sequences of the latter parts of CD8 proteins were as follows : CD8 - WT KRLKRRRVCKCPRPVVKSGDKPSLSARYV * CD8 - CIMPR KRLKYKKERREMVMSRLTNCCRRSANVSY KYSKVNKEEEADENETEWLMEEIQPPAPRPGKEGQENGHVAAKSVRAADTLSALHGDEQDSEDEVLTLPEVKVRPPGRAPGAEGGPPLRPLPRKAPPPLRADDRVGLVRGEPARRG RPRAAATPISTFHDDSDEDLLHV * CD8 - 8xA KRLKRRRIPAAAAAAAAV * CD8 - YAAL KRLKRRRIPAAYAALAAV * CD8 - EAAALL KRLKRRRIPAEAAALLAV * CD8 - FANPAY KRLKRRRIPAFANPAYAV * H2B - GFP , H2B - mCherry , and GFP - LCa were available from previous work ( 2 ) . Mouse monoclonal anti - clathrin heavy chain antibody was puri ﬁ ed from hybridoma CRL - 2228 ( ATCC ) . All reagents were from Sigma , unless stated otherwise . Flow Cytometry . Analysis of surface and internalized CD8 was performed as described ( 1 ) . Brie ﬂ y , HeLa cells expressing CD8 constructs were synchronized in S phase with 2 mM thymidine for 18 h , at the G 2 / M checkpoint with 9 μ M RO - 3306 for 18 h ( 3 ) and in M - phase either by 30 - min release from RO - 3306 treat - ment or with 40 ng / mL nocodazole for 16 h . Thymidine and RO - 3306 arrested cells were trypsinized , whereas cells in mitosis ( nocodazole - arrested or those released for 30 min from RO - 3306 block ) were gently isolated by shake off . We estimate that interphase - synchronized cell populations and ( after shake off ) mitotic populations were > 99 % pure . Cells were then centri - fuged at 4 , 000 × g for 5 min and resuspended in growth medium containing mouse anti - human CD8 Alexa488 - conjugated anti - body ( 1 : 50 , MCA1226A488 ; Serotec ) at 37 °C for 40 min to allow internalization . Subsequently , cells were washed in ice - cold 1 % ( wt / vol ) BSA / PBS before incubation with rabbit anti - Alexa488 ( 1 : 67 , A11094 ; Invitrogen ) and anti - mouse IgG Alexa633 - con - jugated secondary antibodies ( 1 : 200 ; Invitrogen ) , at 4 °C for 30 min . Cells were then washed and ﬁ xed in 3 . 7 % ( wt / vol ) para - formaldehyde before analysis by ﬂ ow cytometry ( FACSCalibur ; Becton Dickinson ) . For quanti ﬁ cation of internalized anti - CD8 Alexa488 , cells expressing equivalent amounts of surface CD8 construct were gated , as described ( 1 ) . The gate was a rectangle that spanned the x axis and excluded the nontransfected cells and those with very high amounts of CD8 on the surface ( 20 – 200 a . u . in Fig . 1 C ) . As a control representing endocytic block , in - terphase cells were incubated with hypertonic sucrose ( 0 . 45 M ) during the uptake assay ( 4 ) . For each condition , 1 × 10 4 cells were measured and after gating , > 1 × 10 3 events were analyzed . This number is far in excess of the tens of cells analyzed by light microscopy in previous studies ( 5 ) . For analysis of transferrin uptake , synchronized cells were trypsinized or isolated by shake off and starved for 30 min in serum - free media . Cells were then incubated with 50 μ g / mL Alexa488 - conjugated transferrin for 5 min at 4 °C , then moved to 37 °C and incubated for 10 min . Cells were pelleted , washed in ice cold 1 % ( wt / vol ) BSA / PBS , acid - washed twice , and ﬁ xed before ﬂ ow cy - tometric analysis . For surface bound and internalized transferrin analysis cells were incubated with Alexa488 - labeled transferrin as described above . After an acid wash , cells were resuspended in ice cold 1 % ( wt / vol ) BSA / PBS containing 50 μ g / mL Alexa647 - con - jugated transferrin ( Invitrogen ) and incubated for 30 min on ice . Cells were then washed , ﬁ xed , and analyzed by ﬂ ow cytometry . For each sample , 1 × 10 4 events from each sample were acquired , and geometric means from four independent experiments were used for comparison and statistical analysis . Analysis of internalized and surface transferrin receptor ( TfR ) was performed by using a similar method to CD8 labeling . HeLa cells were synchronized with thymidine , RO - 3306 ( 10 μ M ) , or nocodazole for 18 h . After synchronization , cells were harvested appropriately ( cells synchronized in M phase by using RO - 3306 were released for 60 min from the drug treatment ) , centrifuged , and resuspended in growth medium containing mouse anti - hu - man TfR - FITC conjugated antibody ( 1 : 5 , SAB4700518 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . Samples were preincubated on ice for 20 min to allow antibody binding to the surface receptors before transfer to 37 °C for 20 min for the internalization to occur . Control ( 4 °C ) sam - ples were not transferred to 37 °C but kept on ice . As a control representing endocytic block , thymidine - treated cells were in - cubated with hypertonic sucrose ( 0 . 5 M ) during the 37 °C uptake assay . After incubation with the antibody , cells were washed in ice - cold 1 % BSA / PBS , before incubation with rabbit anti - FITC ( 1 : 50 , 71 – 1900 ; Invitrogen ) and anti - mouse IgG Alexa633 - con - jugated antibodies at 4 °C for 30 min . Cells were then washed , ﬁ xed , and analyzed by ﬂ ow cytometry . For each sample , 1 × 10 4 events were acquired and geometric means with no gating from three independent experiments were used for comparison and statistical analysis . Immuno ﬂ uorescence and Live - Cell Labeling . HeLa cells on glass coverslips were ﬁ xed with 3 % paraformaldehyde and 4 % sucrose in PBS ( wt / vol ) . For steady - state localization of CD8 constructs , cells were permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS ( vol / vol ) for 10 min . For staining of surface transferrin receptor , no per - meabilization was carried out . Cells were blocked [ 3 % ( wt / vol ) BSA and 5 % ( vol / vol ) goat serum in PBS ] before addition of primary antibodies , followed by washing and secondary antibody incubation ( where necessary ) . Finally , cells were washed and mounted in Mowiol containing 10 μ g / mL 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phe - nylindole ( DAPI ) . For immuno ﬂ uorescence analysis of the CD8 uptake assay , cells were prepared and stained as above except cells were grown on coverslips with no synchronization and anti - mouse IgG Alexa568 - conjugated secondary antibody was used . For live - cell imaging of CD8 uptake , cells were cotransfected with H2B - mCherry and the CD8 constructs . Cells were syn - chronized by using RO - 3306 as above , released for 25 min , then transferred to CO 2 - independent media and a 37 °C , humidi ﬁ ed microscope chamber ( Okolab S . r . l ) . Cells in prometaphase or metaphase were identi ﬁ ed by H2B - mCherry . Alexa488 - conju - gated anti - CD8 antibody was then added at 1 : 100 dilution in CO 2 - independent media , and images were acquired every 30 s for 30 min . For transferrin uptake experiments , the cells were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in serum - free DMEM . Cells were ﬁ rst in - cubated on ice for 5 min followed by addition of 50 μ g / mL Alexa488 - conjugated transferrin ( Invitrogen ) in serum - free me - Fielding et al . www . pnas . org / cgi / content / short / 1117401109 1 of 4 dia . After 30 min on ice , cells were transferred to a 37 ° C / 5 % CO 2 incubator for 7 min ( adequate time to allow substantial uptake but suf ﬁ ciently short so that cells are unlikely to have progressed signi ﬁ cantly through the cell cycle during the course of the up - take ) . Cells were then acid - washed ( 0 . 1 M glycine and 150 mM NaCl , pH 3 ) to remove surface - bound transferrin before ﬁ xation ( 3 % paraformaldehyde and 4 % sucrose in PBS ) for 15 min . Subsequently , cells were processed for immuno ﬂ uorescence as above and stained with rabbit anti - transferrin receptor ( CBL47 ; Chemicon ) followed by anti - rabbit Alexa568 secondary antibody ( 1 : 500 ; Invitrogen ) . For FM4 - 64 uptake experiments , HeLa cells transiently expressing H2B - GFP were incubated with FM4 - 64 ( 15 μ M ; In - vitrogen ) for 10 min . Excess dye was washed from the plasma membrane by using normal extracellular solution ( 136 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 1 . 3 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM Hepes , 2 mM CaCl 2 , and 10 mM glucose at pH 7 . 4 ) for 10 min . Microscopy . Microscopy was performed on a Leica confocal mi - croscope SP2 with a 63 × ( 1 . 4 N . A . ) oil - immersion objective . Alexa488 and Alexa568 were excited by using Ar / Kr 488 nm or He / Ne 543 nm laser lines , respectively . DAPI was excited by using a multiphoton laser . Excitation and collection of emission were performed separately and sequentially . Z - series were ac - quired by using the software ’ s optimized z - depth between each slice ( 0 . 122 μ m ) . For live - cell experiments , either a Nikon Ti ﬂ uorescence microscope and DS - Qi 1Mc camera ( CD8 experi - ments ) or an Olympus IX81 ﬂ uorescence microscope and Orca - ER camera ( FM dye experiments ) was used with a 60 × oil - im - mersion objective . Data Analysis . Flow cytometry data were analyzed , plots were generated in CellQuest ( Becton Dickinson ) , and histograms were made in WinMDI . Quanti ﬁ cation of transferrin uptake and surface transferrin receptor from confocal Z - series was per - formed in Image J by thresholding the stack , drawing around cell outlines , and measuring each section . The background - corrected mean intensities for all slices were summed to give the total intensity for each cell . Alternative methods of quanti ﬁ cation produced the same result . Image J was used to create the max - imum intensity projections shown in supporting information . Data were plotted in Igor Pro - 6 . 2 ( Wavemetrics ) . Figures were assembled in Adobe Photoshop . For statistical testing , one - way ANOVA with Tukey ’ s or Dunnett ’ s post hoc test was used to compare multiple groups . Where only two groups were com - pared , Student ’ s t test was used in Instat ( GraphPad ) . 1 . Kozik P , Francis RW , Seaman MN , Robinson MS ( 2010 ) A screen for endocytic motifs .
