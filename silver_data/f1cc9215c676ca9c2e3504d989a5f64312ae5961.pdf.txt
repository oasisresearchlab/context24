Wiener 3 1 Department of Psychology , University of Warwick , Coventry , United Kingdom , 2 Center for Cognitive Science , University of Freiburg , Freiburg , Germany , 3 Psychology Research Centre , Bournemouth University , Bournemouth , United Kingdom Abstract A considerable amount of research has claimed that animals’ foraging behaviors display movement lengths with power - law distributed tails , characteristic of Le´vy flights and Le´vy walks . Though these claims have recently come into question , the proposal that many animals forage using Le´vy processes nonetheless remains . A Le´vy process does not consider when or where resources are encountered , and samples movement lengths independently of past experience . However , Le´vy processes too have come into question based on the observation that in patchy resource environments resource - sensitive foraging strategies , like area - restricted search , perform better than Le´vy flights yet can still generate heavy - tailed distributions of movement lengths . To investigate these questions further , we tracked humans as they searched for hidden resources in an open - field virtual environment , with either patchy or dispersed resource distributions . Supporting previous research , for both conditions logarithmic binning methods were consistent with Le´vy flights and rank - frequency methods – comparing alternative distributions using maximum likelihood methods – showed the strongest support for bounded power - law distributions ( truncated Le´vy flights ) . However , goodness - of - fit tests found that even bounded power - law distributions only accurately characterized movement behavior for 4 ( out of 32 ) participants . Moreover , paths in the patchy environment ( but not the dispersed environment ) showed a transition to intensive search following resource encounters , characteristic of area - restricted search . Transferring paths between environments revealed that paths generated in the patchy environment were adapted to that environment . Our results suggest that though power - law distributions do not accurately reflect human search , Le´vy processes may still describe movement in dispersed environments , but not in patchy environments – where search was area - restricted . Furthermore , our results indicate that search strategies cannot be inferred without knowing how organisms respond to resources – as both patched and dispersed conditions led to similar Le´vy - like movement distributions .

Power - law distributed movement patterns are superdiffusive , with straight - line movement length , l , having probability distribution function P ( l ) * l { m , with 1 , m , 3 . A common interpretation of power - law distributed movements is that they represent the outcome of Le´vy walks ( with probabilities based on duration ) or Le´vy flights ( with probabilities based on distance traveled ) [ 2 , 5 , 6 ] . When velocities are constant , we can consider these two synonymous , as we do here ( and simply use the term Le´vy flights ) . Both refer to scale - free random walks in which run duration or movement lengths are independently drawn from a probability distribution with a heavy power - law tail . Though the power - law distribution of movement lengths for many organisms has come into question [ 7 ] , the processes which create animal paths are potentially still Le´vy processes . We define a Le´vy process with respect to foraging as a stochastic process in which increments are independently drawn and statistically identical for non - overlapping portions of the path [ 8 ] . Examples of Le´vy processes are Brownian motion , Le´vy flights , Le´vy walks , and Poisson processes . Because the underlying movement distributions do not change in response to resource encounters , Le´vy processes imply that organisms do not use information about recent resource encounters to localize search in space . In contrast to Le´vy processes , patterns of extensive and intensive foraging in response to resource absence or presence , respectively , have also been widely observed across species [ 9 – 11 ] . This pattern of movement is called area - restricted ( or area - concentrated ) search . Area - restricted search requires memory in order to create local intensive searching around locations where resources have been found in the past . Moreover , area - restricted search is capable of generating distributions of movement lengths with heavy - tailed power - law distributions [ 12 , 13 ] . Though some work has been interpreted as suggesting that Le´vy flights are optimal foraging strategies [ 14 ] , these were not compared with alternative strategies like area - restricted search . Comparisons of these foraging strate - gies in destructive foraging environments – where resources are not replaced – have found that when resource locations are spatially PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e60488 uncorrelated ( distributed independently ) , ballistic foraging strate - gies are optimal , whereas when resource locations are spatially auto - correlated ( distributed in clusters ) , then area - restricted search strategies are optimal [ 12 – 16 ] . Historically , the methodological difficulties associated with determining what generates a power - law distribution have led to considerable debate over which animals , if any , actually use Le´vy processes [ 4 , 6 , 7 , 12 , 17 , 18 ] . In part , this argument has tried to address whether animals do Le´vy flights by focusing on the statistical methodology used to identify the underlying distribu - tions [ 4 , 7 , 16 , 17 ] . Still others have investigated behavioral mech - anisms that can generate such distributions [ 12 , 13 , 19 , 20 ] . Here we take a different approach by focusing on the fact that a Le´vy process samples from the same movement length distribution without regard to resource encounters , whereas area - restricted search strategies are processes that sample from different distributions depending on the time passage since last resource encounter [ 21 – 23 ] . Thus , our approach to identifying the underlying data generating process requires knowing exactly where resources are and how behavior changes in response to encountering them . In the present study we focus on human foraging . Consistent with what has been shown for other animals , several studies have attempted to show that human movement patterns may be Le´vy flights [ 2 , 24 – 26 ] . However , other studies have suggested that humans do not use Le´vy flights , because – using maximum likelihood methods and goodness - of - fit tests – the observed distri - butions were found not to follow power - law distributions [ 7 ] . No previous studies have investigated the broader theoretical question of Le´vy processes in humans , nor have previous studies investigated how human search may respond adaptively to the correlational structure of resource distributions . Here we present an analysis of human foraging in a virtual environment , resembling a large open field . Using both clustered Figure 1 .

Our aim was to determine how the movement lengths of human search trajectories are distributed and to address under what circumstances these distributions may represent Le´vy processes or area - restricted search . Methods Participants ( n = 32 ) searched in a circular virtual arena that contained hidden targets . The environment consisted of a textured ground plane resembling a large meadow and was surrounded by a fence , with large distal landmarks ( e . g . , mountains ) to provide global orientation cues . There were no local cues , such as depressed grass , to signal where participants had been ( Fig . 1A ) . Targets were either uniformly distributed ( dispersed condition , Fig . 1B ) or organized in patches ( patched condition , Fig . 1C ) in a between subjects design . People searched the virtual circular meadow ( 110m radius ) displayed on three computer screens , representing 180 u field of view . They did this using the arrow keys , which allowed them to either move forward or turn , but not both at the same time . The distance between two turns was defined as a movement length . 1440 items were randomly located : in the dispersed condition locations were independently and uniformly determined ; in the patched condition , the centers of 24 patches were uniformly assigned , but non - overlapping , and 60 items were randomly located within 8 . 65 meters of the patch center . Participants heard a tone when they encountered an item ( detected at a distance of 0 . 75 meters ) and were required to search for and collect 90 items . The participants were randomly assigned to the two conditions , told to search for 90 items , with the search repeated 5 times for each participant . Participants were not told about the resource distribution . However , participants appear to have learned this rapidly , because behavior did not substantially vary over the 5 repeated foraging trials . We therefore report our analyses on the aggregated individual data over the 5 trails . Statistical analyses used standard likelihood methods and Akaike weights to compare four statistical models : unbounded power - law , bounded power - law , unbounded exponential , and bounded exponential . Methods and code can be found in previous work [ 7 , 27 ] . For reference with past literature supporting Le´vy flights , we also present results based on logarithmic binning [ 18 , 28 ] . In order to evaluate whether or not movements were independent of recent resource encounters , we compared observed turning with baseline turning following resource encounters . Baseline turning was measured by selecting random locations along the recorded trajectories and calculating the turning response as a function of the distance after these random locations ( ‘‘Random dispersed’’ and ‘‘Random patched’’ ) . To establish whether or not paths were adapted to their environments , we compared paths across environments ; paths observed in one resource distribution were simulated 100 times in the alternative resource distribution by rotating them using a uniform random sampling of the initial heading around 360 u . Results Figure 2 presents rank / frequency plots of the data and the model fitting for the aggregated data from each condition and for each individual separately . Data are presented on logarithmic axes because a power - law distribution appears as a straight line on these axes . For the aggregated models ( Fig . 2A , B ) , only the bounded power - law appears to fit the data with any degree of precision . The unbounded power - law overestimates the size of longer moves and the exponential fits underestimate these longer moves . For the individual data , model fits vary widely ( Fig . 2C , D ) , with few individuals appearing to be well described by any statistical model . Before we discuss the statistical tests associated with these distributions , we first present the results of logarithmic binning . For reference with previous literature [ 1 , 5 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 28 – 30 ] , the insets of Figure 2A and 2B present the data using logarithmic binning methods . The slope for the patched condition was m = 2 1 . 45 6 0 . 40 and for the dispersed condition was m = 2 1 . 23 6 0 . 31 . These were not statistically different ( P . . 05 ) . Though necessary for an interpretation of Le´vy flights , these results are far from sufficient . Moreover , the method of logarithmic binning has come under attack for multiple reasons and fails to compare alternative hypotheses [ 7 , 27 ] . Our statistical analyses thus used standard likelihood methods and Akaike weights to compare four statistical models based on the rank / frequency plots : unbounded power - law , bounded power - law , unbounded exponential , and bounded exponential . Table 1 presents the analyses based on aggregated data , providing the evidence ratios for the different models – which represent the Akaike weight of a model divided by the best fitting Akaike weight , such that the best fitting model has a value of 1 . 0 and other models have values . 1 . 0 . Table 2 presents the analyses based on individual data , showing the proportion of participants best fit by each model . For both aggregated and individual data , the bounded power - law model ( truncated Le´vy flight ) was the best fitting model in all cases . We used a G - test ( likelihood ratio test ) to compare the bounded power - law with the data , with the null hypothesis that the data are consistent with this model [ 7 ] . Both aggregated data sets failed the goodness of fit test ( Table 1 ) and all but two individuals in each condition failed the goodness of fit test ( Table 2 ) . This indicates that even the truncated Le´vy flight – despite it being the best of the models we tested – still appears to poorly characterize human behavior . Figure 2 .

These results lend themselves to two conclusions . Foremost , despite a strong apparent fit to power - law distributions when using logarithmic binning , the movement distributions are not well described by power - law distributions and therefore fail to meet a basic requirement of Le´vy flights . Second , the two conditions do not appear to be significantly different from one another based on movement distributions alone , and are therefore potentially consistent with a common underlying search strategy ( but see below ) . The first conclusion is likely to come under some criticism . Only bounded power - laws are meaningful in natural systems , because ‘‘all power laws in nature have upper and lower cutoffs’’ ( p . 41 , [ 16 ] ) . Thus , realistically , we can expect true Le´vy - like behaviors to be best characterized by truncated Le´vy flights , especially if foragers stop when encountering items . Failures to fit bounded power - law distributions may simply reflect improper bounds , which may in this case be a function of , for example , human reaction times or different cognitive processes being used over very short or very long movement intervals . Despite failing the goodness of fit tests , because our data are statistically most consistent with truncated Le´vy flights this may lead some readers to infer that the processes underlying the movement are indeed Le´vy processes . But this is an unfounded inference . Even if the distributions were bounded power - law distributions , different behavioral processes ( besides Le´vy processes ) can generate bounded power - law distributions . As noted in previous literature , inferences based on distributions alone are insufficient evidence to infer Le´vy flights [ 12 , 13 ] . Ruling out such alternative explanations requires an analysis of movement based on where and when resources were encountered . To address this issue , we compared turning angles following resource encounters for both patched and dispersed conditions with a baseline reference class of turning angles evaluated at random points along participants’ paths ( Fig . 3 ) .

We compared path performance by randomly simulating paths from the alternative environment using 100 simulated versions of each observed path in the alternative resource distribution . Paths from the patched condition simulated in the dispersed environment performed as well as dispersed paths in the dispersed environment ( t ( 15 ) = 0 . 05 , P = . 97 , two - tailed t - test ) . However , paths from the dispersed environ - ment simulated in the patchy environment were outperformed by the original paths from the patchy environment ( t ( 14 ) = 2 3 . 91 , P = . 002 , two - tailed t - test ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0060488 . g004 Adaptive Search in Human Foraging PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 5 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e60488 increase their turning angles above the baseline in response to encountering a resource item , this suggests that movement lengths are not independently sampled , but reflect the participant’s initiating intensive foraging . Indeed , following a resource encoun - ter turning angles in the patchy environment were sharper than in the dispersed condition ( M patched = 65 . 47 u , M dispersed = 19 . 85 u ) and sharper than turning angles taken relative to random points along the path ( M random patched = 29 . 79 u ) . Thus , for the patched condition , the results support a transition to an intensive search following resource encounters , confirming area - restricted search . The observed turning angles for the dispersed condition were not different from their random reference class ( M dispersed = 19 . 85 u , M dispersed _ random = 16 . 89 u ) , indicating insensitivity to resource en - counters and consistent with a Le´vy - flight - like process ( possibly a truncated Le´vy flight ) . Was the area - restricted search in the patched condition associated with improved performance , as proposed in previous literature [ 12 , 13 , 16 ] ? To establish whether increased turning following resource encounters was an adaptive change in search strategy , we asked how the paths produced in one environment would have performed had they been observed in the other environment ( Fig . 4 ) . Paths transferred from the dispersed environment to the patchy environment performed worse than paths originally generated in the patchy environment ( observed - new : M dispersed = 2 1 . 47 , SD = 1 . 46 ) . However , paths transferred from the patchy environment to the dispersed environment did not perform differently than the original dispersed paths ( M patched = 2 0 . 31 , SD = 2 . 84 ) . This is consistent with previous theoretical claims and demonstrates empirically that in patchy environments paths adapted to the spatially auto - correlated structure of the resource environment – responding to resource encounters with intensive search – are more efficient than a putative Le´vy - flight - like process . However , in the spatially uncorrelated resource environment , information about resource locations was not provided by resource encounters and participants could efficiently utilize a random Le´vy - like process . Discussion The present work follows Benhamou [ 12 ] in suggesting that the test for a Le´vy flight requires two components : 1 ) an analysis of path distribution , and 2 ) evidence that the path is intrinsically generated and not a result of external resource encounters . Our results demonstrate that these two criteria are possibly met for humans foraging in dispersed , spatially uncorrelated resource environments – where we found movement lengths most consistent with a bounded power - law , though these failed the goodness of fit tests . These paths also showed no sensitivity to resource encounters , suggesting they may be consistent with Le´vy processes . On the other hand , humans exposed to spatially auto - correlated resource environments , with resources distributed in patches , showed similarly distributed movement lengths but adapted their search to the structure of the environment by responding to resource encounters with increased turning , characteristic of area - restricted search . The putative claim for Le´vy flights in diverse categories of living organisms – ranging from T cells to hunter - gatherer foraging camps [ 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 , 31 ] – raises fundamental questions about the underlying generative processes driving these behaviors and the optimality of the resulting search . Our results offer potential inroads to future studies , as well as providing grounds for alternative explanations . In particular , putative Le´vy flights may adapt to the resource structure of their environment by a change in the characteristic scale of their movement length distribution [ 6 ] , movement distributions similar to bounded power - law distributions and possibly changes in movement length distributions may further arise as a result of adaptive changes in behavioral responses to encounters with resources . Because of the similar nature of the two movement length distributions in our two conditions , our results further warn against inferring behavior based on curve fitting . In addition , when behavioral ecologists have investigated how animals respond to resources , area - restricted search has been observed in animals across the metazoan lineage ( e . g . , vertebrates and invertebrates ) and typically involves similar neuromolecular mechanisms [ 32 ] . A common hypothesis when observing both shared traits and shared mechanisms is that the trait existed in an ancestor common to the different species under study . In the case of metazoans , this species would have existed approximately 6 to 7 hundred million years ago . This indicates that area - restricted search is likely to be an extremely common strategy for localizing search around patchy resources in space and should , at the least , represent an alternative hypothesis for comparison in future studies of Le´vy - like movement patterns . Finally , we note that the observed relationship between Le´vy - flight - like processes and area - restricted search , in a single animal ( i . e . , humans ) , provides a foothold for further investigating the behavioral and neuromolecular mechanisms driving power - law distributed behavior across a wide range of species and environ - ments [ 3 , 12 , 29 , 33 , 34 ] . This is in part because the neuromolecular mechanisms underlying behavioral changes in response to environmental rewards are well studied [ 10 , 35 – 37 ] , which allows us to pose new questions for our understanding of the physiological and evolutionary origins of power - law distributed behavior patterns , specifically in terms of how they may be a response to resources .
