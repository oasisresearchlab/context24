Understanding how the ESCRT - III polymer interacts with membrane , pro - moting and / or stabilizing membrane deformation , is an important step in elucidating this sculpting mech - anism . Using a combination of genetic and biochem - ical approaches , both in vivo and in vitro , we identify two essential modules required for ESCRT - III - mem - brane association : an electrostatic cluster and an N - terminal insertion motif . Mutating either module in yeast causes cargo sorting defects in the MVB pathway . We show that the essential N - terminal insertion motif provides a stable anchor for the ESCRT - III polymer . By replacing this N - terminal motif with well - characterized membrane insertion modules , we demonstrate that the N terminus of Snf7 has been tuned to maintain the topological con - straints associated with ESCRT - III - ﬁlament - medi - ated membrane invagination and vesicle formation . Our results provide insights into the spatially unique , ESCRT - III - mediated membrane remodeling . INTRODUCTION The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport ( ESCRTs ) are critical for sorting certain transmembrane proteins into vesicles that bud into the lumen of the endosome . In addition to sorting cargo into intraluminal vesicles ( ILVs ) of multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) ( Babst et al . , 1997 , 2002a , 2002b ; Katzmann et al . , 2001 ) , ESCRTs drive ILV formation and scission . Addition - ally , the ESCRT machinery is involved in viral budding from the plasma membrane and in cytokinesis , where they function as part of the scission machinery ( Carlton and Martin - Serrano , 2007 ; Garrus et al . , 2001 ; Spitzer et al . , 2006 ) . ESCRT - depen - dent membrane deformation is unique when compared to other vesicle formation events in the cell as it is topologically inverted relative to those formed by coats , such as clathrin , COPI , or COPII . Furthermore , the ESCRT machinery localizes only to the neck of the invaginated vesicle and is not incorporated into the nascent vesicle . How the ESCRT machinery achieves this unique form of membrane deformation and scission is the focus of extensive research . The ESCRT - III polymer , consisting of four core subunits , Vps20 , Snf7 , Vps24 , and Vps2 , is believed to play a key role in membrane invagination and vesicle scission . The transient nature of this hetero - oligomeric ﬁlament has made character - izing the ﬁlament difﬁcult . However , recent efforts to visualize the ESCRT - III polymer on lipid monolayers using high - resolution electron microscopy techniques have identiﬁed a key role for electrostatically charged lipids in modulating ESCRT - III ﬁlament architecture ( Henne et al . , 2012 ) . This raises key questions about the ESCRT - III - lipid interaction . For example , how does ESCRT - III bind membrane , and what is the role of this interaction in invaginating membrane , sculpting the vesicle , and promoting scission ? Understanding how the ESCRT - III subunits interact with lipid is critical to elucidating the mechanism for ESCRT - mediated membrane deformation . Here , we identify two key components for its membrane binding : a charged interaction surface and a membrane - inserting N terminus . Interestingly , we ﬁnd that although membrane insertion modules often drive curvature , the membrane - inserting motif of Snf7 has been tuned to maximize its role as a membrane anchor for the ESCRT - III polymer without disrupting the topologically inverted curvature associated with ILV formation . RESULTS Positively Charged Interfaces on ESCRT - III Interact with Membrane ESCRT - III subunits are structurally similar , consisting of a core domain , a ﬂexible linker , an autoinhibitory alpha - helix , and a MIT - interacting motif ( MIM ) ( Figure 1A ) . The core domain con - sists of four tightly bundled alpha - helices . The ﬁrst elongated helix of Vps24 , termed helix - 1 , forms a highly basic surface con - sisting of arginine and lysine residues ( Figure 1B ; Figure S1A available online ) ( Muzio 1 et al . , 2006 ) . Alignment analysis showed not only a high degree of conservation of the positive charges on helix - 1 between the human and yeast orthologs of Vps24 ( 12 and 10 , respectively ) but also with the ESCRT - III subunit Vps2 ( 11 ) ( Figure 1B ) . These conserved , positively charged residues may constitute the membrane interaction interface during binding of ESCRT - III to endosomes . Developmental Cell 27 , 201 – 214 , October 28 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 201 To investigate the role of helix - 1 in membrane binding , we generated mutants of Snf7 , Vps2 , and Vps24 that had an increasingnumberofchargeinversionson helix - 1 . Intheabsence of Vps4 , which recycles ESCRT - III subunits from membrane , greater than 90 % of Vps24 localized to the P13 membrane frac - tion in cellular fractionation experiments ( Figures 1C and 1F ) . There was very little effect on this membrane association with a single charge inversion . However , inverting the charges of two , three , or four residues on helix - 1 sequentially reduced the Vps24 association with the membrane fraction ( Figures 1C and 1F ) . Although membrane - associated Vps24 was reduced after three or four charge inversions , we also noticed that these muta - tions affected protein stability ( Figure S1B ) . To ensure this reduc - tion was not due to the instability of the mutant Vps24 , we changed two positive charges to glutamate and two to neutral alanine residues ( Vps24 EEAA ) .

These results show that the positive charges on helix - 1 of Vps24 are important for membrane association . Accumulating charge inversions on helix - 1 of Vps2 produced similar results to Vps24 ( Figures 1D and 1F ) . Importantly , mutations on helix - 1 of Vps2 did not abolish its ability to bind to and modify Snf7 ﬁla - ments , suggesting that they did not affect its ability to interact with other ESCRT - III subunits ( data not shown ) . This suggests that both Vps2 and Vps24 utilize helix - 1 for their interaction with membrane . Strikingly , similar mutations on Snf7 resulted in greater than 90 % of protein remaining membrane associated ( Figures 1E and 1F ) , indicating that helix - 1 may not contribute to the mem - brane binding of Snf7 . Sequence alignments revealed that many of the helix - 1 - positive charges are not conserved on Snf7 ( Figure 1B ) . Because Snf7 is the most abundant ESCRT - III subunit ( Teis et al . , 2008 ) , understanding its membrane inter - action is essential . An alternative membrane - binding interface on Snf7 , consisting of a series of highly conserved lysines on helices - 2 and - 3 , was identiﬁed from a structure generated using the comparative structural program Modeler ( Figure 1G ) ( Eswar et al . , 2008 ) . Single or multiple charge inversions on this interface impaired the sorting of Mup1 - pHluorin to the vacuole lumen ( Fig - ure S1F ) . These inversions also decreased the membrane asso - ciation of Snf7 by cellular fractionation ( Figure 1H ) . These results were conﬁrmed by light microscopy , as the charge inversion mutants increasingly relocalized Snf7 - GFP to the cytoplasm ( Figure S1H ) . To further investigate these residues , we per - formed liposome sedimentation assays using the Snf7 core domain , which is sufﬁcient to bind membrane in vitro ( Henne et al . , 2012 ) . As expected , introducing two charge inversions from helix - 3 onto the Snf7 core background reduced membrane association ( Figure 1I ) . This provides direct in vitro conﬁrmation of our in vivo results , placing residues from helices - 2 and - 3 at the membrane interface . Importantly , mutations on this interface did not disrupt the ability to form ﬁlaments , suggesting that the altered membrane localization was not due to disrupting Snf7’s ability to oligomerize ( data not shown ) . Thus , Snf7 surprisingly utilizes a different cationic interface for membrane binding , sug - gesting that ESCRT - III subunits uniquely orient in the polymer to contact membrane . The N Termini of ESCRT - III Subunits Contribute to Membrane Binding One ESCRT - III subunit , Vps20 , is N - terminally myristoylated . This lipid modiﬁcation often works in cooperation with other lipid binding modules , such as an electrostatic interface , to provide a high - afﬁnity protein - membrane interaction . We wondered if the other ESCRT - III subunits were similarly utilizing a second mem - brane - interacting module . Many membrane - associated proteins utilize hydrophobic residues that insert into lipid bilayers to stabilize membrane binding . We noted the presence of bulky hydrophobic residues at the N termini of Snf7 , Vps2 , and Vps24 ( Figure 2A ) and hypothesized that , similar to the myristoy - lation of Vps20 , these residues stabilize membrane interactions . Consistent with this idea , liposome binding of human Vps2 was dependent on two conserved N - terminal hydrophobic residues ( Bodon et al . , 2011 ) . We tested the functional signiﬁcance of the N termini of the ESCRT - III subunits by assaying the delivery of GFP - Cps1 to the vacuole . Similar to what was previously reported for the Vps20 myristoylation mutant ( Babst et al . , 2002a ) , deletion of the N - terminal region upstream of helix - 1 on Vps20 resulted in a partial block in GFP - Cps1 sorting . The cargo accumulated both in the vacuole lumen and on the vacu - ole membrane , but not at the aberrant endosomal E dot , where cargo accumulates when Vps20 is absent ( Figure 2B ) . Similar to Vps20 , deletion of this N - terminal region on Vps2 also resulted in a partial sorting defect ( Figure 2E ) . This was in contrast to dele - tion of the homologous N - terminal regions of Snf7 or Vps24 , in which GFP - Cps1 was present at the E dot , suggesting a severe sorting defect ( Figures 2C and 2D ) . These data suggest that the extreme N termini of the ESCRT - III subunits are functionally important for efﬁcient cargo sorting . To better understand the partial sorting defects observed with the N - terminal deletion mutants , we used a quantitative sorting assay that takes advantage of the pH - sensitive nature of the GFP - derivative pHluorin and the acidic environment of the vacuole . By tagging the plasma membrane cargo Mup1 with pHluorin and monitoring its ﬂuorescence after internalization , one can determine whether the cargo is efﬁciently delivered to the vacuole , partially missorted , or trapped at the E dot . By calculating the percent of ﬂuorescence that is quenched , the efﬁciency of sorting can be quantiﬁed and used to assess the severity of the sorting defect ( Figure 2F ) . Using this approach , we found that Vps20 and Vps2 had sorting efﬁciency ratings of 71 % and 74 % , respectively , indicative of the partial sorting defect observed with GFP - Cps1 . In contrast , Snf7 and Vps24 had sorting efﬁciencies of 13 % and 25 % ( Figure 2G ) , consistent with severe sorting defects . These results conﬁrm that although the N termini of all four ESCRT - III subunits are required for efﬁ - cient cargo sorting , they do not all contribute equally . Because the N terminus of Snf7 had the greatest effect on cargo sorting , we replaced the N termini of the other ESCRT - III subunits with the N terminus of Snf7 . This resulted in completely normal MVB sorting ( Figure S2E ) . In contrast , replacing the N ter - minus of Snf7 with that of Vps24 or Vps2 only weakly rescued cargo sorting ( Figure S2F ) . This was surprising due to the homol - ogy between the N termini of Snf7 and Vps2 ( Figure 2A ) . Accord - ingly , changing a negatively charged glutamate in Vps2 to glycine ( E5G ) , as it is in Snf7 , greatly enhanced this rescue ( Fig - ure S2F ) . These data conﬁrm the differential importance of the N termini of ESCRT - III subunits in MVB sorting . Because Snf7 is the most abundant ESCRT - III subunit and is the predominant subunit in the ESCRT - III polymer and has the greatest N - terminal deletion phenotype , we focused our analysis on the N terminus of Snf7 . We next used GFP - fusion constructs to assess the effect of the N - terminal deletion on Snf7 endosomal localization . When expressed in WT yeast , Snf7 - GFP was located in puncta . Dele - tion of the N terminus of Snf7 redistributed Snf7 - GFP from its punctal localization to the cytoplasm ( Figure 2H ) , consistent with a role for the N terminus in associating with membrane . To further demonstrate that the N - terminal sorting defect was due to reduced membrane binding , we performed liposome sedimentation assays using Snf7 core and D N - Snf7 core . As ex - pected , deletion of the N terminus nearly completely abolished the ability of Snf7 core to associate with membrane ( Figure 2I ) .

Similar to what was observed for the human Vps2 ( Bodon et al . , 2011 ) , deletion of the N terminus of Vps2 also resulted in reduced membrane association , although not nearly as drastic as Snf7 ( Figure S2H ) . This provides further correlation between the sorting results and membrane association . To ensure the altered localization was not due to oligomeriza - tion defects , we introduced a mutation on D N - Snf7 that pro - motes Snf7 ﬁlament formation ( Henne et al . , 2012 ) . D N - Snf7 R52E was able to form ﬁlaments on EM grids , conﬁrming that the N ter - minus did not affect oligomerization ( Figure S2I ) . Furthermore , ﬁlaments formed by Snf7 R52E can be clearly visualized associ - ating with liposomes by electron microscopy . However , deletion of the N terminus abolished this association ( Figure S2J ) . These data clearly demonstrate that the N terminus of Snf7 is important for membrane association . The N Terminus of Snf7 Requires Hydrophobic Residues By sequence alignment , we noticed the conserved position of key hydrophobic residues at the N terminus ( Figure 3A ) .

Map - ping the N - terminal sequence of Snf7 on a helical wheel revealed an amphipathic helix , with a hydrophobic surface made up of these large N - terminal residues aligned opposite of a polar interface made up of several serine res - idues ( Figure 3B ) . Substitution of the N - termi - nal tryptophans ( Snf7 W2E and Snf7 W8E ) or the highly conserved phenylalanine ( Snf7 F6E ) with negatively charged glutamate resulted in the aberrant sorting of both GFP - Cps1 ( Figures 3C and S3B ) and Mup1 - pHluorin ( Figures 3D and S3C ) . Importantly , replacing the phenylal - anine with other hydrophobic residues did not affect the sorting of either cargo . Point muta - tions of key residues on the other ESCRT - III subunits similarly resulted in reduced sorting of Mup1 - pHluorin ( Figure S3D ) , thus demonstrating the importance of the hydro - phobicity of the N terminus . We next sought to correlate the functional defect associated with the hydrophobicity of the N terminus with membrane asso - ciation . Importantly , addition of the F6E mutation to the cationic interface mutant ( 4KE ) further reduced membrane binding , reducing the amount of protein associated with the P13 fraction from 52 % to 24 % ( Figure 3E ) . By light microscopy , addition of F6E to Snf7 - GFP redistributed the protein from puncta to the cytoplasm , similar to what was observed for D N - Snf7 - GFP ( Figure 3F ) . Although some puncta were still present , the F6E mutation in combination with the cationic interface mutant ( Snf7 F6E / 4KE - GFP ) resulted in nearly complete cytoplasmic localization . These results conﬁrm a role for both the hydropho - bic N terminus and the cationic interface of Snf7 in membrane binding . Liposome sedimentation assays were used as an additional conﬁrmation for the role of the N - terminal hydrophobics in mem - brane binding . Both puriﬁed Snf7 core / W2E and Snf7 core / F6E had Developmental Cell ANCHRing ESCRT - III to Membrane Developmental Cell 27 , 201 – 214 , October 28 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 205 impaired binding to liposomes in vitro . In contrast , Snf7 core / F6W associated with liposomes at similar levels as the wild - type ( WT ) Snf7 core ( Figure 3G ) . Thus , two regions in Snf7 mediate membrane interactions : a positively charged cationic interface and an N - terminal hydrophobic motif . The N Terminus of Snf7 Inserts into the Membrane N - terminal amphipathic helices on proteins , such as Arf1 or the N - BAR family , insert into membrane bilayers to induce mem - brane curvature ( Farsad and De Camilli , 2003 ) . Because the N terminus of Snf7 is involved in membrane binding and is depen - dent on hydrophobic residues , we reasoned that these residues might insert into the membrane bilayer to generate or stabilize membrane deformations . To test this , we ﬁrst utilized the ﬂuores - cent dye 7 - nitrobenz - 2 - oxa - 1 , 3 - diazole ( NBD ) , which undergoes an increase in emission intensity and a change in its maximum emission upon shifting to a hydrophobic environment ( Johnson , 2005 ; Saksena et al . , 2009 ) . We labeled Snf7 core with NBD on cysteine residues introduced into the N terminus ( Snf7 core / F6C , helix - 1 ( Snf7 core / K35C ) , helix - 2 ( Snf7 core / Q75C ) , or helix - 3 ( Snf7 core / H118C ) ( Figures 4A and S4A ) . A large increase in emis - sion intensity and a shift in maximum emission was observed upon addition of excess liposomes to the Snf7 core domain labeled at the N terminus ( Figures 4B , 4C , and S4B ) . In contrast , addition of liposomes to Snf7 core labeled with NBD on helices - 1 , - 2 , or - 3 resulted in only a very slight increase in intensity ( Figures 4B , 4C , and S4C ) . Thus , the N terminus shifts to a hydrophobic environment in the presence of liposomes . Membrane - inserting motifs prefer to bind liposomes with smaller radii because of their high - membrane curvature ( Bigay et al . , 2005 ) . To investigate if the Snf7 N - terminal motif could sense membrane curvature , we tested the ability of Snf7 core to bind liposomes of different sizes . To mitigate the contribution of the cationic interface , we used uncharged liposomes composed of 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) alone , generated by extrusion through progressively smaller ﬁlter pores 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 F6CN - term K35Ch - 1 Q75Ch - 2 H118Ch - 3 R e l a t i ve A b s o r b a n ce a t 530 n m 0 40000 80000 120000 160000 500 550 600 F l uo r esce n ce Wavelength F6C F6C + Lipos H188C H188C + Lipos Buffer Liposomes Alone B U B U WT 800 nm Filter : B U B U 100 nm 30 nm F6E No Lipos 100 mol % POPC Snf7 core : 8 % ±1 % 33 % ±4 % 32 % ±3 % 43 % ±3 % 5 % ±3 % 4 % ±4 % 3 % ±6 % 3 % ±3 % h - 3 H118C F6C N - term K35C h - 1 h - 2 Q75C A D C B in vitro liposome sedimentation Figure 4 .

This observation , in combina - tion with the previous results , provides strong evidence that Snf7 contains a membrane - inserting N - terminal motif . The Snf7 N Terminus Can Be Replaced by Known Membrane - Inserting Motifs We next investigated if the N terminus of Snf7 is a general inser - tion module or a sequence - speciﬁc recognition module by testing if unrelated membrane - inserting motifs could rescue the D N - Snf7 - sorting defect . We replaced the N terminus of Snf7 with the well - characterized membrane - inserting modules of the curvature - sensing ALPS motif of Osh4 ( ALPS - Snf7 ) , cur - vature - inducing helix - 0 of Rvs161 ( h0 - NBAR - Snf7 ) , or the scis - sion - promoting N terminus of Arf1 ( Arf1 - Snf7 ) ( Beck et al . , 2011 ; Bigay et al . , 2005 ; Drin et al . , 2007 ) . Both the well - charac - terized helix - 0 of Rvs161 and the ALPS motif were able to rescue the sorting of Mup1 - pHluorin ( Figure 5A ) . This rescue was dependent on key N - terminal hydrophobic residues , similar to what was observed for Snf7 , as substituting these residues for glutamate failed to rescue cargo sorting ( Figure S5C ) .

Unexpectedly , addition of the Arf1 N - terminal amphipathic he - lix to D N - Snf7 did not rescue Mup1 - pHluroin sorting ( Figure 5A ) , despite maintaining the ability to localize to membrane puncta ( Figure S5D ) . Because this helix is posttranslationally modiﬁed with a myristoyl group , we reasoned that this modiﬁcation would adversely affect Snf7 function by providing too high of an afﬁnity reaction with membrane . To test this , we replaced the N terminus of Snf7 with the myristoylation sequence of Vps20 ( Myr - Snf7 ) and found , surprisingly , that it was sufﬁcient to rescue Mup1 - pHluroin sorting . This rescue was dependent on the myristoyl group , as mutating the glycine residue at position two to alanine ( Myr - Snf7 G2A ) did not rescue Mup1 - pHlourin sorting ( Figure 5C ) . Perhaps even more surprising , we found that mutation of the myristoylated glycine residue of Arf1 - Snf7 to an alanine ( Arf1 - Snf7 G2A ) also restored sorting to wild - type levels ( Figure 5C ) . Therefore , addition of the unmyristoylated , but not myristoy - lated , Arf1 N - terminal helix to Snf7 is sufﬁcient to rescue cargo sorting . These data show that a myristoyl group or a known membrane - inserting amphipathic helix , but not both , are able to function at the N terminus of Snf7 . We were intrigued by the rescue of cargo sorting by both the membrane curvature - sensing and curvature - inducing helices and the myristoyl group . We reasoned that one role of the N ter - minus of Snf7 could be to insert into the bilayer and drive membrane curvature during ILV morphogenesis . Alternatively , membrane deformation could be driven by the previously visual - ized ESCRT - III helices ( Hanson et al . , 2008 ; Henne et al . , 2012 ) . In this model , the predominant role of the N terminus is to act as a membrane - inserting anchor to allow the polymer assembly to exert the mechanical forces necessary for driving membrane deformation . Because the well - characterized modules that rescue cargo sorting are predicted to deform membrane to differing degrees , the ﬁrst model would predict that they would produce intraluminal vesicles of varying morphology ; the amphi - pathic helices that promote deformation would result in smaller vesicles . In contrast , the latter model predicts that the N terminus allows the mechanical force of ESCRT - III polymer assembly to drive deformation and that the intraluminal vesicle morphology would be independent of the N - terminal insertion module . Expression of either h0 - NBAR - Snf7 or Myr - Snf7 resulted in ILVs with wild - type size and morphology ( Figures 5D and 5E ) , providing support for the latter model . We thus propose that the ESCRT - III oligomer is the predominant driver and stabilizer of membrane deformation during intraluminal vesicle morpho - genesis . The N terminus , by inserting into membrane , provides a high - afﬁnity anchor that allows for the oligomer - membrane interaction to drive this deformation . We will hereafter refer to the N terminus of Snf7 as the a mphipathic N terminus c ontaining h ydrophobic r esidues motif ( ANCHR ) . The Snf7 ANCHR Motif Balances Opposing Curvatures during ILV Formation Generation of an intraluminal vesicle requires maintaining an intricate balance of competing curvatures . Although the rim of the invagination contains a high degree of positive curvature , the curvature of the membrane at the inside and bottom of the invagination is negative ( Figure 6A ) . Whereas the helical nature of the ESCRT - III oligomer ( Henne et al . , 2012 ) could stabilize the negative curvature of the invagination , the insertion of its N - terminal amphipathic anchor would have a competing effect and promote the opposing positive curvature . The ability of an amphipathic helix to insert into and deform membrane is dependent upon both the residency time in mem - brane and the shape ( length and bulkiness ) of the helix . Helices , such as the ALPS motif , that are believed to sense , but not actively promote , deformation contain polar residues on the hydrophilic interface ( Drin et al . , 2007 ) . In contrast , amphipathic helices that contain positively charged residues on the hydro - phillic interface have increased residency time in the membrane because of the interaction of these positive charges with the negatively charged lipid head groups ( Drin and Antonny , 2010 ) . Insertion of an amphipathic helix with high deforming properties that would generate positive curvature would compete with the negative curvature stabilized by the oligomer and would be detrimental to intraluminal vesicle formation . In support of this hypothesis , the properties of the ANCHR motif of Snf7 are consistent with anchoring and not deformation - promoting heli - ces , namely , it is small in size and contains only polar residues on the hydrophilic interface ( Figure 3B ) . Experimentally , this would explain why the myristoyl group and ALPS motif were bet - ter able to rescue cargo sorting than were the chimeras with known membrane - deforming helices , such as the helix - 0 of N - BAR proteins , ENTH domain , and the N terminus of Arf1 ( Fig - ures 5A and S5F ) . To further test the effect of altering the insertion properties of the ANCHR motif of Snf7 on intraluminal vesicle formation , we generated several N - terminal amino acid extensions . We ﬁrst added a string of positive charges ( 6K - Snf7 ) and then converted it to an amphipathic helix by substituting three lysines for three tryptophans ( 6WK - Snf7 ; MWKKWWK ) . We then varied the length of the N terminus by adding lysine and tryptophan residues to generate progressively longer helices with more membrane deforming potential ( 10WK - Snf7 and 14WK - Snf7 ) . As expected , the 6K - Snf7 construct did not rescue sorting ( Fig - ure 6B ) , demonstrating that positive charges were insufﬁcient to anchor Snf7 and reafﬁrming the requirement for a membrane - in - serting element . In contrast , the 6WK - Snf7 construct sorted Mup1 - pHluorin at wild - type levels . Intriguingly , increasing the length of the N - terminal motif through addition of tryptophan and lysine residues progressively decreased the ability of the chimeras to efﬁciently sort Mup1 - pHluorin ( Figure 6B ) . Further analysis of the 10WK - Snf7 mutant showed that its decreased ability to sort cargo was not due to its mislocalization in cells ( Fig - ure S6B ) or the inability to bind membrane . In fact , 10WK - Snf7 core bound liposomes in vitro better than did both Snf7 core and 6WK - Snf7 core ( Figure 6C ) , two N termini that efﬁciently rescue the D N - Snf7 - sorting defect in vivo . To further demonstrate the negative correlation between efﬁ - cient cargo sorting and promoting membrane deformation , we assayed the ability of the chimeras to deform membrane . The insertion of hydrophobic amino acids into membrane can generate bilayer asymmetry and drive membrane curvature ( Gallop et al . , 2006 ) . In order to assay the membrane curva - ture - generating ability of the N - terminal chimeras separate from the curvature generated by the ﬁlaments , we took Developmental Cell ANCHRing ESCRT - III to Membrane 208 Developmental Cell 27 , 201 – 214 , October 28 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . advantage of the Snf7 core domain , which is unable to form Snf7 ﬁlaments ( Henne et al . , 2012 ) . Addition of puriﬁed Snf7 core to liposomes did not result in tubulation or deformation of lipo - somes . In contrast , addition of puriﬁed h0 - NBAR - Snf7 core to liposomes resulted in membrane tubule formation , which ap - peared to be stabilized by a protein coat ( Figures 6D and S6C ) . Although some tubules were present after addition of 10WK - Snf7 core to liposomes , most of the liposomes were con - verted to small vesicles ( Figures 6D and S6C ) . Tubulation has been described as a highly unstable vesicle budding intermedi - ate formed by scaffolding proteins , such as a BAR domain or coat protein , which can subsequently promote vesiculation A B C D Figure 6 .

Addition of the highly deforming 10WK - Snf7 core promoted this transition to vesicula - tion . Although whether the vesicles were independent vesicles or connected like beads on a string was unclear , 10WK - Snf7 core clearly promoted the highest degree of membrane remodeling . Notably , a similar trend in the ability to deform membrane was observed when full - length constructs of the chimeras were used ( Figure S6D ) . These results are consistent with the decreasing ability of the respective chimeras to sort cargo , providing evidence that the ability to strongly induce positive curvature during ILV invagination decreases the ability to efﬁ - ciently sort cargo . The Snf7 ANCHR Motif Alters the Kinetics of Cargo Sorting The factors involved in generating and stabilizing the membrane curvature associated with ILV morphogenesis , both positive and negative , have been tuned to maintain the delicate balance of opposing curvatures . Disrupting this balance decreases the efﬁ - ciency of vesicle formation and slows the kinetics of cargo sort - ing . Although steady - state sorting assays were sufﬁcient to detect mutants that adversely affect this intricate balance , we sought to further test these mutants using a kinetic assay to monitor cargo sorting . We monitored the ﬂuorescence quench - ing of Mup1 - pHluorin after methionine stimulation using a mutant with impaired membrane localization ( Snf7 F6E ) , with a nonde - forming N - terminal motif ( Myr - Snf7 ) and a deformation - promot - ing N - terminal helix ( h0 - NBAR - Snf7 ) . As expected , Myr - Snf7 sorted with wild - type kinetics , whereas Snf7 F6E exhibited a very slow quenching rate ( Figures 7A and 7B ) . Interestingly , cargo sorting by h0 - NBAR - Snf7 was signiﬁcantly delayed compared to the wild - type sample , even though under steady - state conditions h0 - NBAR - Snf7 had the ability to signiﬁcantly rescue cargo sorting ( Figures 7A and 7B ) . Thus , although h0 - NBAR - Snf7 functions , it does so less efﬁciently than wild - type Snf7 , consistent with the hypothesis that the presence of the NBAR helix - 0 disrupts the delicate membrane curvature equilib - rium in ILV formation . By light microscopy , Mup1 - pHluorin was found in highly dynamic green puncta in the wild - type and Myr - Snf7 samples , but in larger , less mobile structures in the h0 - NBAR - Snf7 and Snf7 F6E samples , consistent with the accu - mulation of endosomal intermediates ( Figure S7 ) . Thus , the N - terminal interaction with membrane is important for fast cargo sorting . Our mutational analysis has provided key insights into the role of the endogenous Snf7 ANCHR motif by identifying three func - tional categories of N - terminal mutants ( Figure 7C ) . Mutants that are unable to insert into membrane , for example , Snf7 F6E or D N - Snf7 , cannot provide the anchoring function necessary to allow the ESCRT - III polymer to exert the required forces to stabilize the invagination and are therefore functionally defective ( Fig - ure 7D ) . Mutants that are able to provide a membrane anchor without promoting a high degree of positive curvature , such as Myr - Snf7 or ALPS - Snf7 , are able to efﬁciently rescue cargo sort - ing to near wild - type levels . In contrast , the ability to rescue cargo sorting decreases as the ability to deform membrane increases . This is likely due to disrupting the intricate balance of positive and negative curvatures associated with forming a nascent vesicle . DISCUSSION Although ESCRT - III drives MVB morphogenesis , the mecha - nistic basis for membrane remodeling is unclear . The inability to visualize the ESCRT - III polymer at atomic resolution has hin - dered efforts to elucidate ESCRT - III’s role in membrane defor - mation and scission . Our approach to address these issues has been to focus on the distinct functions of ESCRT - III : ( 1 ) membrane binding , ( 2 ) oligomer assembly , ( 3 ) cargo sequestra - tion , ( 4 ) membrane invagination , ( 5 ) ILV neck narrowing , and ( 6 ) scission . We have recently provided visual evidence of the ESCRT - II / ESCRT - III ring architecture capable of cargo seques - tration ( Henne et al . , 2012 ) . Although constructs that promote ﬁlament formation have provided insights into the nature of the ESCRT - III ﬁlament ( Ghazi - Tabatabai et al . , 2008 ; Hanson et al . , 2008 ; Lata et al . , 2008 ) , other assays are required to deﬁne ESCRT - III’s role in membrane remodeling . Recent studies have highlighted that ESCRT - III accumulates at the highly curved neck of an invagination . This , and the fact that ESCRT - III is not consumed during ILV morphogenesis , underscores the importance of studying ESCRT - III membrane interactions . Through a series of complimentary in vivo and in vitro approaches , we provide a detailed analysis of ESCRT - III membrane binding and remodeling . We identiﬁed two features shared among the four core ESCRT - III subunits important for membrane binding : a cationic interface consisting of a cluster of positively charged residues on one face of the ESCRT - III pro - teins and a membrane - inserting N - terminal ANCHR motif con - sisting of an amphipathic helix on Snf7 , Vps24 , and Vps2 , and a myristoyl group in Vps20 . The ﬁrst feature , the cationic inter - face , was unexpectedly different on Snf7 , suggesting that the subunits may uniquely orient in the ESCRT - III polymer . This het - erogeneity underscores the functional difference among a group of structurally similar subunits . The presence of the N - terminal ANCHR motif is not surprising as the generation of other cellular vesicles is associated with membrane - inserting motifs , including the topologically equivalent budding of inﬂuenza virus , which requires the amphipathic helix of the M2 viral protein ( Antonny et al . , 1997 ; Ford et al . , 2002 ; Gallop et al . , 2006 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ; Rossman et al . , 2010 ) . Any model to describe ESCRT - III - mediated scission needs to account for both the structural features of the ESCRT - III polymer and the properties of the various scission events it mediates . In other words , the ESCRT - III ﬁlament must have the ability to mediate diverse scission events , from the generation of small in - traluminal vesicles at the endosome and HIV viral particles at the plasma membrane , to the much larger - scale abscission during cytokinesis . One key feature that allows ESCRT - III to mediate such diverse events is the regulated assembly of the ESCRT - III polymer by key upstream factors , such as ESCRT - I and – II , in ILV formation or the HIV Gag protein in viral budding . This regulated assembly likely accounts for one remarkable feature of ILV’s , their consistently regular size ; however , future experi - ments must investigate this further . Another key feature shared among these scission events re - quires that ESCRT - III binds tightly to and constricts membrane , acting as a membrane scaffold . This requires maintaining mem - brane binding under conditions of increased force due to mem - brane tension . The tightening spiral must therefore be anchored Developmental Cell ANCHRing ESCRT - III to Membrane 210 Developmental Cell 27 , 201 – 214 , October 28 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % 100 % 0 20 40 60 80 100 % I n i t i a l F l uo r esce n ce Minutes Post Methionine Additon Kinetic Sorting Delay of N - terminal Snf7 Mutants WT F6E h0 - NBAR MYR Deformation stabilized by ESCRT - III polymer Snf7 N - terminal insertion anchors ESCRT - III ionic interactions to membrane m = - 1 . 91 % m = - 0 . 65 % m = - 1 . 03 % y = - 1 . 79 % 0 . 0 % 20 . 0 % 40 . 0 % 60 . 0 % 80 . 0 % 100 . 0 % 8 40 Slope Comparison of Snf7 Mutants Minutes ∆N - Snf7 6K - Snf7 Snf7 F6E Myr - Snf7 G2A Snf7 WT Myr - Snf7 6WK - Snf7 ALPS - Snf7 Snf7 F6W Snf7 W2E h0 - NBAR - Snf7 10WK - Snf7 14WK - Snf7 Arf1 - Snf7 D e f o r m i ng P o t en t i a l MVB Formation Arf1 - Snf7 G2A Impaired Binding Unbalanced Curvature Invagination Vesicle formation WT Snf7 Vesicle formation ∆N - Snf7 No ILV Formation X ILV Scission Polymer assembly Elongation Disassembly Membrane : ESCRT - III : Vps4 E - II E - II E - II E - II A E B C D Figure 7 .

As the polymer elongates and the number of protein - mem - brane contacts increase , the afﬁnity of the polymer to membrane is ampliﬁed , allowing the polymer to provide the mechanical force necessary to act as a scaffold and stabilize the invagina - tion . Under conditions in which Snf7’s ANCHR motif is compro - mised ( Snf7 F6E or D N - Snf7 ) , the ESCRT - III polymer is unable to drive membrane invagination and efﬁciently progress to vesicle formation ( Figure 7E ) . Our study of Snf7’s ANCHR motif addresses the balance of curvatures associated with ILV formation . The rim of the invagi - nation is positively curved ( Figure 6A ) and may initially be gener - ated by upstream ESCRT machinery and clustered cargo ( Boura et al . , 2012 ; Wollert and Hurley , 2010 ) . Snf7’s ANCHR motif may act as both a sensor of this positive curvature and a curvature stabilizer . Studies have shown that Snf7 localizes to both invag - inations and along highly curved membranes ( Fyfe et al . , 2011 ; Henne et al . , 2012 ; Wollert and Hurley , 2010 ) . An invagination also contains negative curvature around its circumference . The ESCRT - III polymer acts as a circular scaffold that binds the membrane and stabilizes this invagination ( inward deformation and cargo - laden nascent vesicle ) . We observed that other well - characterized membrane - inserting wedge domains known to promote or sense positive curvature ( h0 - NBAR - Snf7 and ALPS - Snf7 ) rescue the D N - Snf7 - sorting defect to varying de - grees . Interestingly , Arf1 - Snf7 did not rescue cargo sorting , likely due to its strong membrane deformation and scission - promoting properties ( Beck et al . , 2011 ) , which cause it to disrupt the intri - cate balance of curvatures associated with ILV formation . This is consistent with the reduced functionality of the synthetic 10WK - Snf7 chimera , which also has the ability to promote a high degree of membrane deformation ( Figure 6D ) . Furthermore , the Arf1 - Snf7 chimera was able to rescue cargo sorting when its mem - brane afﬁnity was reduced by preventing its myristoylation ( Figure 5C ) . These results demonstrate that the properties of different amphipathic helixes have been tuned to their speciﬁc roles in curvature sensing and anchoring ( ALPS motif , Snf7’s ANCHR motif ) , membrane bending ( h0 on N - BAR proteins ) , or vesicle scission ( Arf1 ) . We have exploited these helices to pro - vide insights into the delicate balance of competing curvatures that exist during ILV morphogenesis between the ESCRT - III polymer and the insertion events . How does the growing ESCRT - III polymer deform membrane as it assembles ? We propose that the ESCRT - III polymer initially forms a ring on the surface of the endosome , ( restricting the ANCHR motifs to the circular rim of the membrane invagination ) , surrounding the cargo clustered by the upstream ESCRT machinery . The elongating ESCRT - III ﬁlament assembles into a three - dimensional ( 3D ) helical spiral ( corkscrew ) , which is anchored to membrane by the ANCHR motif , further invaginating the membrane domain contained within the ESCRT - III ring . In this model , the tight membrane binding of the growing ﬁlament may keep the transmembrane protein cargo concentrated in this membrane domain , ahead of the growing , narrowing ﬁla - ment , ultimately forming the vesicle at the front , leading edge , of the ESCRT - III spiral . Upon scission at the leading edge , and narrowest point of the ﬁlament , the concentrated cargo would be packaged into the nascent ILV , excluding the ESCRT - III ﬁla - ment from the nascent vesicle ( Figure 7D ) . What promotes the ESCRT - mediated scission event ? As the polymer elongates , the counterforce due to the increasing resistance from the de - forming membrane and the tension from the insertion of the ANCHR motif into the bud neck may restrict the elongating helix into a tightening 3D spiral that promotes scission at its narrow end . Alternatively , the constriction of the ESCRT - III polymer may be coupled to the binding and disassembly reaction driven by the AAA - ATPase Vps4 . The ANCHR motif of Snf7 forms a tight association between the ESCRT - III polymer and the membrane prior to vesicle scission and removal of the membrane - anchored ESCRT - III scaffold may destabilize or buckle the membrane , triggering ﬁssion . Altering the properties of the ANCHR motif may also affect the ability of Vps4 to disassemble the ESCRT - III scaffold , delaying the kinetics of ILV formation . The ESCRTs have emerged as cargo recognition , cargo sequestering , and membrane remodeling machinery , with a particular emphasis on a role for the ESCRT - III polymer in membrane deformation . Of the six distinct stages of ESCRT - III activity , this study provides important insights into ESCRT - dependent membrane bending and vesicle formation . Additional studies and new assays will be required to further analyze the neck narrowing and scission steps , including a precise role for the Vps4 ATPase in these reactions .

Liposomes were made in 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) and 150 mM NaCl by classical dehydration and sonication for 1 min . The liposome composition was 60 % DOPC : 30 % phosphatidylser - ine : 10 % phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate . Variations of the composition were 100 % DOPC or 25 % DOPC : 75 % PS . All lipids were purchased from Avanti or CellSignals . Where indicated , liposomes were extruded through 800 , 100 , or 30 nm ﬁlters . The supernatant ( unbound ) and pellet ( bound ) were directly prepared for SDS - PAGE and visualized with Coomassie stain . Value is average of three independent sedimentation assays . Fluorescence Spectroscopy Cysteine residues on puriﬁed Snf7 core constructs were labeled with excess IANBD ( N , N ’ - dimethyl - N’ - ( iodoacetyl ) - N ’ - ( 7 - nitrobenz - 2 - oxa - 1 , 3 - diazole - 4 - yl ) ethylenediamine ) ( Molecular Probes ) for 2 hr at 4 (cid:1) C protected from light . Samples were double dialyzed into buffer containing 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 0 . 1 % b - mercaptoethanol to quench and remove excess IANBD . All reactions were performed in 150 m l ﬁnal volume in quartz cuvettes . Liposomes were incubated in excess ( 250 m M ) with protein for 10min . The excitation wavelengthwas 468nm and theemission wasscanned at 500 – 590 nm . Electron Microscopy Visualization of Snf7 polymers on EM grids with or without liposomes was per - formed as previously described ( Henne et al . , 2012 ) . For Snf7 liposome assays , 15 m M Snf7 R52E was mixed with 600 m M liposomes for 10 min and was added to EM grid . For tubulation experiments , 10 m M protein was added to600 m Mliposomesandincubatedfor15min . Sampleswerenegativestained with ammonium molybdate . Yeast cells were ﬁxed with 2 . 5 % ( v / v ) glutaraldehyde for 1 hr and sphero - plasted with 250 m g zymolyase and 50 m l gluculase before embedding in 2 % ultra - low temperature agarose . Cells were incubated in 1 % osmium tetrox - ide / 1 % potassium ferrocyanide ( 30 min ) , 1 % thiocarbohydrazide ( 5 min ) , and 1 % osmium tetroxide / 1 % postassium ferrocyanide ( 5 min ) . Cells were extensively washed in water after each treatment . After dehydration through an ethanol series , samples were transitioned into 100 % propylene oxide and embeddedinSpurr’sresin . AllelectronmicroscopywasperformedonaMorg - nani 268 transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) with an AMT digital camera .
