Gregory M . Mocko , Committee Chair Dr . Georges F . Fadel Dr . Melur Ramasubramanian ii ABSTRACT Biomimetic design offers an avenue for designers to expand the solution realm by offering surface dissimilar analogies . However , a significant challenge within biomimetic design has been offering a suitable method for discovery and retrieval of inspiring biological phenomena to aid in conceptual design . This research proposes an approach for classifying both biological systems and engineering products into the type of problem being addressed . This allows designers to search for inspirational phenomena based on the type of problem that they are trying to solve . Initially this classification is performed with product - phenomenon pairings that have already been attributed to biomimetic design from an online database of bio - inspired products . Three experiments are performed to develop and validate the set of classifications . These experiments tested designers’ ability to classify biological phenomena , evaluated the classifications , and validated the correctness of the classification for each product - phenomenon pairing . The experiments resulted in a classification schema of six problem types : materials , machines , fluids and dynamics , heat transfer , mechanics of materials , and energy . The average Kappa is 0 . 73 , which is significant agreement between raters . The product classification was performed by three separate raters and showed a high level of inter - rater agreement . Furthermore two raters classified the products using a primary and secondary classification schema . The primary and secondary classifications resulted in a Kappa value of 0 . 92 . Future research work to complement the classification scheme is the identification of rules based from text mining of biologically inspired products . iii Specifically text mining approaches and Artificial Neural Networks ( ANN ) , as well as a biological classification are integrated to discover relations . iv DEDICATION This thesis is dedicated to my parents , Peter and Patricia Murray , and my siblings , Dylan and Connor Murray . My family has helped me every step of the way to obtain higher education and given me the motivation to continually strive for success . Their love has and always will be known and appreciated . v ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to thank my advisor , Dr . Gregory M . Mocko . His advice and patience has aided me throughout my graduate career and in life . He continually pushed me outside of my comfort zone . This has taught me to think deeper , be more creative , and always strive to do my best given any situation . I could not have picked a better advisor and will always remember my time spent working for Dr . Mocko . I would highly recommend Dr . Mocko to any graduate student . I would also like to thank all of the members of CEDAR for the support and collaboration throughout the years . The advantages of collaboration have led to an improvement in my creativity as well as ability to reason . I would like to specifically thank Matthew Peterson and Rahul Renu for their aid with my database coding . Also Patrick Harrington and Blake Linnerud for their aid in research efforts . Finally I would like to thank the Mechanical Engineering Department at Clemson University for financial support the past two years . vi TABLE OF CONTENTS Page TITLE PAGE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i ABSTRACT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ii DEDICATION . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . iv ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . v LIST OF TABLES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ix LIST OF FIGURES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . xi CHAPTER ONE CHALLENGES IN BIOMIMETIC DESIGN . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 CHAPTER TWO LITERATURE REVIEW . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 2 . 1 Design By Analogy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 2 . 2 Biomimetic Design . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 2 . 3 Current Tools for Biomimetic Design . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 2 . 4 Summary of Gaps . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 vii Table of Contents ( Continued ) Page CHAPTER THREE PROPOSED APPROACH . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 3 . 1 General Framework . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16 3 . 2 Tasks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18 CHAPTER FOUR EXPERIMENTAL CLASSIFICATION AND VALIDATION . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22 4 . 1 Experiment 1 -

For example , George de Mestral was awarded the patent for Velcro™ in 1955 . The inspiration for Velcro™ came to de Mestral after letting his dog inside only to realize that the dog had a number of burrs stuck to its fur . Upon further examination of the burrs , de Mestral realized that the burrs contained tiny hooks that were able to clasp onto the fibers in the dog’s fur . Seeing this de Mestral thought it could serve as a novel mechanism for fastening . Through adaptation of the materials used , George de Mestral released Velcro™ . Velcro™ is now a household item that can be found on products ranging from shoes to astronaut suits . De Mestral’s discovery of Velcro™ was an example of both a solution driven problem , as well as a chance discovery . Had de Mestral’s dog not explored the woods , or de Mestral had merely thrown out the burrs , then he may not have been able to realize the potential for Velcro™ . Upon the realization , de Mestral continued to produce a solution driven product . Therefore the creation of Velcro™ came from a chance discovery of the biological solution , followed by a refinement of that solution to an applicable product realm . The drawback of solution driven problems is that engineers do not often create products in this manner . Some products may be created in this manner but are often a 2 result of chance discovery rather than the following of a systematic design process . More and more companies are moving toward forward systematic design processes as a manner of realizing products [ 1 ] . Engineers are often tasked with a problem statement and continue to find solutions to the problem at hand [ 1 ] . Early in the design process a high level modeling of products and functions is encouraged . The objective of this research is to provide a means of classifying biologically inspired products and developing a tool to aid engineers’ discovery of applicable biological phenomena . Specifically a means of discovering biological phenomena based on the type of engineering problem they are applicable to . Specifically this research identifies a classification method based on the problem type addressed by the product . This method of classification will help aid inspiration for biomimetic design by viewing the biological phenomena from an engineering perspective . Many of the current biomimetic products have either been developed through a chance discovery of nature , or in another non - systematic method for discovery of inspirations . These methods for biomimetic design cannot be sustained . Tools must be developed to aid the designer in the discovery of biological phenomena that may be applicable to the problem at hand . The growth of biomimetic design has led to a flow of information regarding products that have already been inspired by biological phenomena . Many biomimetic products have been well documented , and provide knowledge allowing for grouping sets of inspirational phenomena . In order to aid in future inspirations , it would be 3 advantageous to group the products and phenomena based on the type of product developed . To perform this grouping a set of product - phenomenon pairings were taken from the AskNature [ 2 ] website . These pairings represent a set of biological phenomena that have inspired an actual product , and therefore have some relevance to that products general classification . Therefore the groupings of biological phenomena can be discovered based on this set of product - phenomenon pairings . Current tools for biomimetic design have not approached classification of products and phenomena based on the type of problem they are addressing . These tools have found other means of searching and discovering products that can be difficult to manage , or do not provide a clear relation to engineering . Providing engineers with this relation will aid their ability to understand biological descriptions from the correct perspective . Biomimetic designs also involve design by analogy principles , because biological solutions cannot be directly transferred into engineering solutions . This is made clear for multiple reasons . Engineering products and biological solutions face different challenges in similar situations . For example compare a building and a palm tree both faced with the task of withstanding hurricane winds . A palm tree reacts to hurricanes through numerous strategies ; some trees shed their leaves to reduce the force of the wind being applied to the tree , others simply are flexible enough to bend and allow the wind to pass by . Buildings cannot perform this feat in the same manner , the building must maintain its main functionality of being able to house humans , and a structure that can bend severely 4 in the wind , or would shed part of its structure would be unable to perform this task . Also buildings cannot grow back the pieces it loses in a hurricane . The differences between the technical realm and the natural realm cause the need for analogical thinking to allow for biomimetic design . This research focuses on a means for providing designers with the ability to discover biological phenomenon that may be relevant to the problem domain they are attempting to design in . This is performed through the development of a classification approach towards products and inspirational phenomena , and then extended to the development of a database enabling searching for biological phenomena . The main objective is to provide designers with a means of retrieving biological phenomena relevant to the problem being addressed . Specifically this is performed through the classification of realized biomimetic products into engineering problem domains . This classification is then extended to the inspirational phenomena for each product . A web - based tool is then developed for execution of search retrieval for sources of potential biological phenomena . This also begins to form the analogy for the designer by introducing the problem domain in the technical realm . This will reduce amount of time spent attempting to discover relevant biological processes therefore improve the ability to perform biomimetic design . 5 CHAPTER TWO LITERATURE REVIEW Biomimetic design offers engineers many opportunities for inspiration , yet many of the examples of biomimetic design have resulted from specific cases and have not been generalized into an approach that would allow a designer to formulate solutions based off natural systems . Much of the research performed on biomimetic design focuses on transferring the biological system after it has been realized . Discovering the biological system appears to be the difficult and unaddressed task of biomimetic design due to the fact that engineers tend to look towards artificial solutions for inspiration rather than to the natural realm . This is not a problem of a lack of information , but a lack of communication and misunderstanding . 2 . 1 Design By Analogy Design by analogy , as specifically applied to biomimetic design , has been researched and proven to have its advantages . Design by analogy is realizing an analogy between one problem ( or system ) and applying that analogy toward the task at hand . For example , a designer may consider changing the type of energy used in the system to create an analogy [ 1 ] . Analogies have also proven helpful in understanding the problem statement being addressed [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] . The effects of using biological representations as analogies has been studied [ 3 – 9 ] . These studies have shown that biological examples offer a surface dissimilar analogy 6 that is able to increase novelty and variety of concepts generated during the design process [ 5 ] . Surface dissimilar analogies are analogies that do not come from the same realm . A surface similar analogy comes from the same realm and can be discovered more easily . For example , analogies between bikes and motorcycles would be surface similar analogies while analogies between a bike and a biological system would be surface dissimilar analogies . Research has shown that using biological examples as surface analogies has increased the novelty and variety of solutions ; however surface similar analogies increased the novelty to a higher degree [ 5 ] . The surface dissimilar analogy increased the variety of solutions generated due its distance from the technical realm . This decreased the amount of fixation by designers . Methods for producing problem driven and solution driven analogies from nature have been developed . Proposed methods of transferring biological information into useful engineering information are forms of TRIZ , functional modeling , reverse engineering methods , a biological - to - engineering thesaurus , and causality approaches [ 10 – 16 ] . This research proposes that each of these methods can be used to draw analogies from the biological realm into the technical realm , however do not provide a means of realizing solutions and performing forward engineering . Analogies aid the designer in concept formulation as well as clarification of task [ 3 – 5 ] . Analogies are useful in biomimetic design due to the inability of solutions to be directly copied from nature , more abstract understandings of the concepts must be transferred . 7 2 . 2 Biomimetic Design Many of the successful cases of biomimetic design appear to be solution driven designs . Design problems are usually problem driven and require the search for a large number of solutions . A problem driven approach has been created , however designers became fixated due to the amount of time required to discover and understand the biological solutions in the appropriate context [ 9 ] . It is necessary that a tool is developed in order to aid in the search and retrieval of biological phenomena to problem driven designs . This would enhance the ability of designers to discover biological solutions regardless of problem statement . Other methods involve the training of students and engineers to turn towards biological solutions [ 17 ] . Some problems arise as the engineers attempt to directly transfer physical components from bio - systems and implement them into the solution [ 3 , 18 ] . A correct tool for biomimetic inspiration would allow designers to look at the source of inspiration from an engineering standpoint , and aid in the formation of an analogy . Another study involving student designs showed that while students utilized a biological example in 52 % of designs , the designs contained variety due to the lack of fixation on a specific engineering solution [ 5 ] . However in this study students were given a biological concept that was applicable to the design problem . Other studies have shown that students become fixated on biological solutions when they are asked to discover their own solutions [ 3 , 4 ] . This fixation can be attributed to the large amount of time required of engineering students to discover and understand the biological phenomena . 8 Methods of categorizing biological solutions through the use of keywords have been explored to create a hierarchy of biological transformative solutions [ 19 ] . This categorization method is performed on the biological processes and does not aid the designer in performing forward engineering . Similar categorizations of biological information have been performed and can be difficult to understand and manage when creating technical solutions [ 2 ] . The following challenges are presented in the literature :  Solution driven rather than problem driven designs  Fixation due to amount of time required to discover and understand biological solutions  Focus on biological solutions , does not provide engineers a means of performing forward engineering through problem statements 2 . 3 Current Tools for Biomimetic Design Researchers at the University of Toronto have developed a tool for search and retrieval of biological solutions based on a Natural Language transformation [ 7 , 12 , 15 , 20 ] . These transformations are heavily rooted in Wordnet and present a causal relationship to the user . It is believed that this causal relationship will help the user to identify the means by which the biological phenomena are performing the desired functionality . However , the tool does not enable searching on the problem being addressed , and is founded strongly in the functional word used to describe the task . While this theoretically makes sense , many designers can develop different functional words for the 9 same action . The difference in these functional words will omit inspirational phenomena depending on the user . Another tool developed for aiding biomimetic inspiration is Vattam’s DANE [ 21 ] . DANE allows the user to search a variety of biological systems that have been developed into a Function - Behavior Structure ( SBF ) model . The SBF model describes how a functionality of a system is reached through both its behavior and structure . The development of these models is very time consuming , and sometimes can take up to 100 hours of development time per model . This is not a sustainable model to maintain the growth of the tool . Currently DANE contains 31 inspirations . There is also no good means of searching DANE , and some of the information is lacking . When performing a search , the biological phenomena are presented in a list with a sentence describing the system . There is no relation presented between the biological realm and an engineering realm . Examination of DANE shows that there is a difficulty associated with ease of use as well as understanding the biological terminology that is being used . The difficulty in understanding the terminology leads to a difficulty in realization of analogies . Although the information is presented in an SBF structure that is familiar to engineers , it is difficult to navigate and understand the information that is being presented . Furthermore there are not enough inspirations captured by the database . This is due to the large amount of time that is required to create the SBF model . Another tool for biomimetic design is AskNature . The Biomimcry institute has been developing a website ( Asknature . org ) to aid engineers in the inspirational process . 10 Figure 2 . 1 - Biomimcry Taxonomy Cooperate and compete Chemically assemble Detach a functional group 11 They have developed a Biomimcry Taxonomy believed to allow engineers the ability to search biological phenomena . The website has classified biological processes based on this taxonomy ( see Figure 2 . 1 ) . The Biomimcry Taxonomy contains 156 different classifications and contains vocabulary such as “detach functional group” , “chemically assemble” , and “cooperate and compete” . This vocabulary may be useful in classifying biological phenomena ; however as an engineer looking for conceptual designs to a problem statement this terminology is not helpful . Also having 156 different classifications increases the difficulty of searching especially in early stages of design . In the early stages of the design process , engineers are encouraged to explore many possibilities of solutions , and are approaching the problem from a high level [ 1 ] . Therefore tools that allow engineers to maintain this high level approach to the problem should be encouraged . A total of 156 separate classifications do not allow the designer to remain at a high level when searching , and will require a large amount of time to explore . The large amount of time required to discover an appropriate biological inspiration often leads to fixation [ 9 ] . Fixation is discouraged early in the design process [ 1 ] . A high level classification schema would enable the designers to search for appropriate biological phenomena early in the design stage without a large investment in time . Currently the biological systems are not easily searched based on engineering terminology or principles . Designers attempting to perform biological design often become fixated on a certain concept due to the amount of time invested in discovering an applicable concept to their problem [ 9 ] . The large amount of time required can be attributed to the difficulties of engineers to search and understand biological terminology . 12 This is an issue as engineers have been trained to approach problems through the perspective of engineering terminology and principles . There is a need to provide designers with a means of performing forward engineering , through the ability to search biological phenomena based on engineering principles . Discovery of these phenomena may allow for the use of other tools to aid in the ability to perform an analogical design , however the means for aiding in retrieval must be developed further . The following challenges are presented by the current tools :  Time consuming methods of database expansion and population  AskNature classification schema difficult to navigate and understand through an engineering perspective  No means of understanding what types of products biological solutions may be applicable to  No means of searching based on problem type 2 . 4 Summary of Gaps The major challenges in biomimetic design are related to the ability to realize an appropriate source of information , and determine an appropriate analogy . The majority of this research will focus on aiding the designers in discovery of inspirational sources . The work will address the gaps found in the literature and allow an appropriate means for discovery of relevant phenomena ( see Table 2 . 1 ) . 13 Table 2 . 1 – Gaps in Literature Gap Literature No means of searching biological information based on problem type , the means of searching for biological inspirations is time consuming and causes designers to become fixated [ 5 , 7 , 12 , 16 , 19 , 22 ] Time consuming methods of expanding repositories and means of transferring biological solutions into the technical realm [ 9 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 21 ] Biological terms are often difficult for engineers to understand and add a value of ambiguity to the descriptions and therefore hinders the designers’ ability to realize an analogy [ 5 , 18 , 20 , 23 ] Suggested methods are not very sustainable and may involve including biologists at the design table , training of future engineers , or creating solution driven problems [ 3 , 4 , 16 , 17 , 24 ] 14 CHAPTER THREE PROPOSED APPROACH Current inspirational methods in biomimetic design involve a one to one mapping from the natural realm of solutions into the engineering realm ( see Figure 3 . 1 ) . The mapping of natural solutions involves the elements of chance discovery solution driven problems . Figure 3 . 1 – Current inspirational method A few challenges arise from taking this approach . Biological language and engineering language are not similar . Engineers describe products in methods such as function , behavior and structure . Biological textual descriptions are very technical and difficult for an engineer ( with little exposure to biology ) to understand . Shu [ 15 ] identifies the difficulty of engineers to understand biological text . Functional keywords 15 for engineers may have an unintuitive counterpart in the natural realm . For example , an engineer may be attempting reach a functionality of clean . Natural phenomena often reach their desired cleanliness through preventative measures such as defending against unwanted agents [ 15 ] . It would not be intuitive for designers to use defend and clean as counterparts . Furthermore it can often be difficult for numerous engineers to agree upon one function within the engineering realm . For example , some engineers may use the phrase “transfer electrical energy” to describe the functionality of a wire , while others may describe use the phrase “provide electrical energy” . These discrepancies would propagate through the transfer into the biological realm . A second challenge is that the one to one mapping of a biological phenomenon to an engineering product tends to promote solution driven problems . A solution driven problem is when a product idea is formulated , and then a purpose for that product is found . Engineers tend to design in a problem driven manner . That is , understanding the problem at hand , and then attempting to find appropriate solutions . Again using the example of Velcro™ , de Mestral determined that the hooks and burr would be a novel means of attaching two separate fabrics . He was not previously attempting to find a solution for attaching two fabrics together . Solution driven problems do serve a purpose in the design of new products , but does not account for the majority of products [ 1 ] . For the most part engineers do not create products in this manner . Design processes are very forward moving from an initial problem statement stage , to a final design . Engineers work in this manner of forward design . Note that the product solutions are initially sought during the conceptual design phase [ 1 ] . At this stage of design , solutions are still 16 high level ideas and do not contain a large amount of detail . When searching for solutions it is advantageous to remain at a high level of functionality and abstraction . 3 . 1 General Framework In an attempt to avoid one to one mapping , chance discovery of biological phenomena a classification of products their associated inspirational phenomena was performed ( see Figure 3 . 2 ) . Determining realized biomimetic products’ classification allows for classification of the inspirational phenomena . Returning to the Velcro™ example , Velcro™ would be classified under materials . It is known that cockleburs inspired Velcro™ , therefore cockleburs can be classified into materials . In order to address the current gaps identified in Table 2 . 1 , it is suggested that this method of classifying inspirational phenomena is implemented . Figure 3 . 2 – Grouping inspirational phenomena based on product type 17 The suggested classification method is based on the following principles :  Many biomimetic products currently have been realized  Products can be grouped together based on the type of problem they are addressing  Biological systems have many similar systems that can be discovered through textual processing Based on these principles , the classification of product - phenomena pairings can be performed and expanded upon to allow for a higher level process of searching for inspirations . Due to the challenges posed by the current methods of biomimetic design , the authors sought to create a tool for designers to use during a typical design process . Grouping the biological phenomena based on the type of engineering problem they could address would increase the designers’ ability to discover appropriate phenomena at a high level . It is often difficult for engineers to realize a correct conceptual extraction from all the complexities associated with biological systems [ 13 ] . Yet selecting biological phenomena and choosing its applicable classifications would be very opinionated and would involve the need for interdisciplinary teams of biologists and engineers . The solution was to use products that had already been credited to biomimetic design . A group of products described on AskNature were collected along with their inspiring phenomena . Because these inspirations have already been credited to biomimetic design , we can begin to group the biological inspirations based on the type of 18 product that they inspired ( see Figure 3 . 1 ) . These classifications are generalizations of the type of engineering problem with which a designer would be faced . This classification process sets a base set of inspiring phenomena that can be built upon by searching for similarities within textual biological descriptions . The textual descriptions of the base set of biological phenomena can be used to develop a training set to discover new biological phenomena . Similarities in the textual descriptions will allow for an automated expansion of the database . To create the previously described tool , it is necessary to realize the appropriate set of classifications . A correct set of classifications needs to be developed based on descriptions that engineers would use to describe problem types . The following experiments were developed to realize the correct set of product classifications , and validate that the product classifications are correct . The correct set of classifications will then be used to develop a database , and text mining paired with ANN will be used to expand the database . 3 . 2 Tasks The proposed method becomes valid through verification of the following hypothesis :  Designers have difficulty identifying the correct classification of biological phenomena  Problem types are an appropriate means of classifying engineering products 19  Engineers can agree on the specific classifications of realized biomimetic products  A method for expansion of biological phenomena and a means of classifying can be developed Verification of these hypotheses will ensure that the gaps discussed in Table 2 . 1 are appropriately addressed . Figure 3 . 2 can be updated to reflect the tasks that need to be performed ( see Figure 3 . 3 ) . The appropriate classifications must be determined , the products and corresponding biological solutions must be classified appropriately , and biological solutions that have not yet lead to inspiration must be placed into a relevant classification . 20 Figure 3 . 3 - Classification Process Four experiments were performed to accomplish the verification of the hypotheses . Detailed explanations of the experimental procedures and results are outlined in the following section . It was determined that classifying products based on problem types is a useful means of representing potential sources of inspiration for designers . A set of classifications was also agreed upon by four participants ( see Table 3 . 1 ) and a set of forty five products was classified with a high level of inter - rater reliability . 21 Table 3 . 1 - Classification Schema Classification Definition Example Variables of Interest Materials The development of a material’s structure , at the atomic or molecular scales in order to improve its macroscopic properties Coefficient of Friction , Hardness , Density , Ductility Machines Device used to alter , direct , and transmit forces for a useful purpose ( Myszka ) Position , Velocity , Acceleration , Work Fluid Dynamics Concerned with the effects of external forces acting on a body or system of bodies Drag , Lift , Pressure Heat Transfer Dealing with problems relating to heating and cooling ΔT , q , q’ , q’’ Mechanics of Materials The arrangement of a collection of parts , improving the overall abilities of a structure Stress , Strain Energy Concerned with the ability to capture and transfer power from another source BTU , Voltage , Watts , 22 CHAPTER FOUR EXPERIMENTAL CLASSIFICATION AND VALIDATION Four different experiments have been performed to validate the classifications of biological products into engineering disciplines . Each experiment served a different purpose within this process ( see Figure 4 . 1 ) . Figure 4 . 1 – Summary of four experiments B 1 B 2 B 3 B 4 . . . . B m - 1 B m P 1 P 2 P 3 P 4 . . . .

If designers have a difficult time realizing this connection then a means of providing the connection for them should be established . The second experiment determines the correctness of the classification schema that is used , as well as provides validation for the means of using a classification schema based on the type of problem being addressed . Experiment 3 classifies the engineering products that have been attributed to biological inspiration and sets up determination of a proper key of biologically inspired products that will be used for implementation of the database . Experiment 4 refines the key developed in Experiment 3 through the use of primary and secondary classifications . The primary and secondary classifications add an element of knowledge to the data by separating the information into a direct and indirect correlation . A relation between near field and far field analogies can also be realized using this primary and secondary classification schema . The combination of experiments addressed these issues :  A designer’s ability to recognize biological systems that have led to inspirations  The correctness of the engineering classifications  The correctness of the categorization of products  The necessity of primary and secondary classifications These validations are necessary to determine an appropriate schema and motivation for the work . Experiment 1 determined how well designers are able to determine the correct classification of biological phenomena . Experiment 2 evaluated the correctness of the 24 classifications , and lead to the development of a new set of classifications . Experiment 3 used closed card sorting techniques perform classification of biomimetic products to determine a level of inter rater agreement . Experiment 4 displayed a necessity for primary and secondary classifications , as well as an improvement in the level of inter rater agreement . The combination of experiments provided validation for the classification approach discussed in Chapter Three . A more detailed discussion of each of the experiments is presented in the following sections . 4 . 1 Experiment 1 - Testing Designers’ Ability to Classify Biological Phenomena This experiment was performed with the purpose of determining engineers’ ability to classify biological phenomena into engineering classifications ( see Figure 4 . 2 ) . This is intended to determine if engineers are able to classify biological problems from a purely biological description . The experiment was useful for determining if engineers are able to recognize a correct product type based solely on biological descriptions . The biological descriptions used had already been attributed to a product , and therefore the type of problem being addressed was already known . If engineers are not able to perform this classification then there will be a need for providing engineers with the classification of biological solutions . The four experiments involved four raters , each with different backgrounds within engineering ( see Table 4 . 1 ) . The raters represent varying levels of expertise in Mechanical Engineering as well as a varying level of knowledge in biomimetic design . 25 Figure 4 . 2 – Focus of Experiment 1 B 1 B 2 B 3 B 4 . . . .

Not involved with research in biomimetic design . 4 . 1 . 1 Method The first experiment performed was a closed card sorting experiment . Closed card sorting experiments involve asking participants to sort a listing into a predefined set of classifications . The author formed a collection of 45 products that had already attributed inspiration to biological phenomena . These products were then categorized into a set of initial classifications developed by Rater 1 and Rater 2 ( see Table 4 . 2 ) . 27 Table 4 . 2 – Original set of classifications Classification Definition Materials The study of a product’s properties of matter and the affect it has on its applications Machines Collection of components assembled together in order perform a useful task Fluid Dynamics Products behavior under certain external forces and reactions Structures Product’s whose overall structure affects the reaction of various forces on the product Energy Products that are able to harness one form of energy and transfer it into another form Each of 45 products was categorized into these classifications based on the type of problem that the product was solving . Some products were categorized into multiple classifications . This initial categorization served as the key for the type of product to which the biological phenomenon was applicable . Descriptions of each of the inspiring phenomena were also collected . Participants in the experiment were given 15 different biological descriptions as well as the classifications and definitions described above . The participants were then asked to select all the classifications to which they believed the biological descriptions were applicable . The survey was administered to graduate and undergraduate students at Clemson University . These students are well schooled in design and have a high level of experience with product creation . 28 4 . 1 . 2 Data The results were collected from the participants and evaluated against four criteria : True Positive , True Negative , False Positive , and False Negative ( see Table 4 . 3 ) . A true positive response is one in which , using the biological description , the participant was able to identify the correct type of product inspiration , while a true negative response represents a participant correctly identifying that there was no inspiration . True positives and negatives were considered as the most desirable responses . Table 4 . 3 - Results of Experiment ( % ) Classifications True Positive True Negative False Positive False Negative Materials 59 . 26 60 . 61 39 . 39 40 . 74 Machines 23 . 68 73 . 17 26 . 83 76 . 32 Fluids / Dynamics 47 . 50 85 . 00 15 . 00 52 . 50 Structures 50 . 00 73 . 75 26 . 25 50 . 00 Energy 43 . 18 85 . 53 14 . 47 56 . 82 Total 45 . 83 76 . 04 23 . 96 54 . 17 4 . 1 . 3 Results A distinction must be made between the false responses and their meanings . A false positive response means that a participant identified a problem type that currently has no known inspiration from the biological phenomena . This is not a poor response since this simply means that there currently is no product that has been inspired from the biological phenomena , that does not inhibit the potential for inspiration and could be a future avenue for a product . False negatives were considered the undesirable response . 29 A false negative represents that a participant was unable to correctly identify that a biological phenomenon led to inspiration of a product . These are products that are verified to have biological inspiration . This was the undesirable response . Table 4 . 3 shows the results of the responses received from the survey . Each correct response was either a true positive or a true negative . Therefore the percentages shown above do not represent a percentage of the total responses , but a percentage of the possible responses . A response for an identified materials product would either receive a true positive or false negative depending on how the participant responded . An inverse correlation is present between true positives and false negatives as well as between true negatives and false positives ( see Table 4 . 3 ) . The data shows a high percentage of false negatives , 54 % of the time participants were not able to correctly identify a source of inspiration . As previously mentioned , this is the most undesirable response . Participants had a particularly difficult time identifying inspirations in machines ( 76 % ) . Participants were able to identify that a biological phenomenon was not a source of inspiration 76 % of the time . In general the materials classification tended to have overall better scores . 4 . 1 . 4 Discussion Experiment 1 showed that it is difficult for engineers to realize what classification of engineering products biological phenomena are relevant to . This may be due to a lack of knowledge within the biological realm , or the difficulty presented by the use of biological terminology for transfer into technical classifications . Generally , engineers do 30 not possess the means of realizing the application of biological solutions in the technical realm . This verifies the need to provide engineers with a means of searching biological information based on a product type . This presents a need for a method to classify phenomena that have not been attributed to product inspiration . 4 . 2 Experiment 2 - Evaluation of Classifications The second experiment is intended to evaluate the classifications for correctness and motivation for use ( see Figure 4 . 3 ) .

P n - 1 P n Classifications Biological Solutions Engineering Solutions 31 In other words , are there other types of problems that should be reflected in the classifications , and is using problem classifications a useful means of representing potential solutions ? Verification of these two aspects assures that the research has merit and will be useful for designers . Once the proper classifications have been realized the remaining classification process can be completed . 4 . 2 . 1 Method To validate the accuracy of the classifications used in the previous experiment , two more participants were asked to develop their own classification schemas for products ( Rater 3 and Rater 4 ) . One of these participants was an undergraduate researcher , and the other was a graduate researcher . Both participants are current students in the Mechanical Engineering department at Clemson University . The experiment performed was an open card sorting experiment . The participants were given the same list of 45 products ; however they were not given the list of classifications . Participants were asked to evaluate the 45 products and determine the type of engineering problem . The participants performed this experiment individually and without any prior knowledge of the classifications developed by Rater 1 and Rater 2 . The primary takeaway from this experiment was the evaluation of the correctness of the classifications developed by Rater 1 and Rater 2 . It was also desired to determine if any product types were excluded from the initial list . A secondary result from the experiment is agreement between raters regarding the categorization of products . The level of agreement between these raters is not highly accurate ( due to the inconsistent 32 classifications across raters ) , but can be used to gain some insight to agreement between raters . The two participants developed similar classifications in that they included the original classifications in some form with some additional classifications as well . However the classifications that were developed by all three raters were similar in nature and seemed to only differ in the nomenclature provided by each participant . There was a high level of agreement in the type of classifications that should be used . The participants developed classifications very similar to the original set of classifications . A final set of classifications was developed through collaboration of the participants and used to determine how well the raters agree on the classification of each product . 4 . 2 . 2 Data The open card sorting experiment yielded a new set of classifications from each of the raters . The participants were not told how many classifications to use , as a result Rater 3 identified seven classifications and Rater 4 identified six classifications . Table 4 . 4 shows a summary of the classifications developed by each set of raters . 33 Table 4 . 4 – Classifications Identified by Rater Rater Classifications R1 and R2 Materials , Machines , Fluids / Dynamics , Structures , Energy R3 Materials , Chemical , Mechanical , Fluids , Heat Transfer , Structure , Electrical R4 Materials , Machines , Fluids / Aero , Heat Transfer , Mechanics of Materials , Energy 4 . 2 . 3 Results While the number of classifications varies across the raters , there are some similarities between the raters . Each rater identified materials , machines ( mechanical was determined to be the same classification ) , fluids ( coupled with others ) . This helps to verify that engineers think in similar a similar manner , especially when identifying problem types . Through discussion it was identified that the inconsistency between raters is attributed to a difference in terminology . All the raters met and determined which classifications could be considered similar between one another . Relationships between the raters’ differing classifications were made ( see Table 4 . 5 , Table 4 . 6 , and Table 4 . 7 ) 34 Table 4 . 5 – Relationships between classifications ( R1 and R2 – R3 ) R1 and R2 Materials Machines Fluids / Dynamics Structures Energy R 3 Materials x Chemical x Mechanical x Fluids x Heat Transfer x Structure x Electrical x Table 4 . 6 – Relationships between classifications ( R1 and R2 – R4 ) R1 and R2 Materials Machines Fluids / Dynamics Structures Energy R 4 Materials x Machines x Fluids / Aero x Heat Transfer x Mechanics of Materials x Energy x 35 Table 4 . 7 – Relationships between classifications ( R3 – R4 ) R4 Materials Machines Fluids / Aero Heat Transfer Mechanics of Materials Energy R 3 Materials x Chemical x Mechanical x Fluids x Heat Transfer x Structure x Electrical x Note that within each pair of raters , the rater with the higher number of classifications is fit into the rater with the lower number of classifications . This was done because it would have been difficult to separate the results from one classification into two separate classifications . Therefore multiple classifications were lumped into one . Using this information a Cohen’s Kappa score was calculated to determine how well raters agreed . This Cohen’s Kappa does not accurately reflect the level of inter rater agreement since the raters were evaluating the products across different classifications . It does however provide some insight and can be used to draw conclusions . A value of 0 . 6 or higher is considered to be in good agreement . The data shows that overall there was no set of data that is considered to be in good agreement . The highest score is 0 . 53 between R1 / R2 and R4 . There is good agreement between raters within some of the classifications . These classifications tend to be the ones that raters agreed upon and did not involve the lumping of multiple classifications . This is seen best 36 in the materials classification . Every rater identified materials as a classification for the products . R1 / R2 and R4 have a Kappa value of 0 . 62 and R3 and R4 had a Kappa value of 0 . 79 . Both scores represent strong agreement . R1 / R2 and R3 have a Kappa value of 0 . 58 which is close to 0 . 6 , but this score is evaluated with R3’s chemical classification lumped into materials ( see Table 4 . 8 ) .

It was determined that using example state variables for each classification would aid in the categorization process . This is helpful since many of the problems that engineers address , involve some variable . For example a machine involves work and velocity , while energy related products involve Watts and Voltage . The new set of classifications , definitions , and example variables were developed as a result of this experiment ( see Table 4 . 9 ) . 37 Table 4 . 9 – Final Set of Classifications Classification Definition Example Variables of Interest Materials The development of a material’s structure , at the atomic or molecular scales in order to improve its macroscopic properties Coefficient of Friction , Hardness , Density , Ductility Machines Device used to alter , direct , and transmit forces for a useful purpose ( Myszka ) Position , Velocity , Acceleration , Work Fluid Dynamics Concerned with the effects of external forces acting on a body or system of bodies Drag , Lift , Pressure Heat Transfer Dealing with problems relating to heating and cooling ΔT , q , q’ , q’’ Mechanics of Materials The arrangement of a collection of parts , improving the overall abilities of a structure Stress , Strain Energy Concerned with the ability to capture and transfer power from another source BTU , Voltage , Watts , 4 . 2 . 4 Discussion The experimental results show that designers think similarly with respect to problem domains . The three groups of raters developed similar problem domains and were able to collaborate to create one set of classifications . This shows that a high level , designers do think within terms of problem domains , and are able to classify products based on the problem types . Therefore this verifies that using problem domains as a means for classification of products is a valid form of representation for designers . This 38 is important because the biological information must be represented in a manner that would be helpful to engineers working within the design process . At early stages in the design process it is helpful to use high level concepts and this schema would aid the ability to remain at a high level . This would also enable engineers to perform biomimetic design through forward engineering and discover problem driven products rather solution driven products . 4 . 3 Experiment 3 - Correctness of Product Classification Correct classification of the base set of products is necessary for database expansion . The product classification is used to remove subjectivity in classification of biological phenomena . Since there is a set of biological phenomena that have been attributed to biomimetic design , it can be stated that the inspirational biological phenomena has relevance to its product’s classification . Therefore identifying the correct product classifications is essential ( see Figure 4 . 4 ) . 39 Figure 4 . 4 – Focus of Experiment 3 Every product in the database ( P 1 , P 2 , … P n ) has an inspirational biological phenomena ( B 1 , B 2 , … B n ) that will be classified based on the product classification . Future expansion of the biological solutions ( B m + 1 , B m + 2 , … B n ) will be performed by finding biological solutions that are similar to the already classified solutions . 4 . 3 . 1 Method As a follow up to the previous experiment , a consolidated set of classifications was developed by all four of the raters . This set of classifications was then used by Rater 1 , Rater 3 , and Rater 4 to perform a second closed card sorting experiment . This experiment output a re - categorized list of products . Again each participant performed the 40 classification experiment individually and could categorize each product into multiple classifications . This experiment was intended to create a unified set of classifications that could be used as a key for future experiments . Also agreement between raters would ensure that the classifications are correct , and that a set of engineers can understand the classifications . Understanding the classifications is important for an engineer . If engineers are not able to understand and agree on these classifications then they will not be useful for product development . To evaluate the agreement between raters a Cohen’s Kappa value was calculated between each pair of raters . The Cohen’s Kappa value calculates the appropriateness of the classifications , as well as the participants’ ability to understand the classification . More discussion on the Cohen’s Kappa value will be discussed in the results section . 4 . 3 . 2 Data Using the new set of classifications , that were output from the second experiment , the three raters reevaluated the set of products . Again a Cohen’s Kappa value was calculated between each pair of raters , and used to evaluate the inter - rater agreement ( see Table 4 . 10 ) . These values represent a more accurate insight to the level of inter - rater agreement than in Experiment 2 . The Kappa values show a significant level of inter - rater agreement . This shows that three separate raters individually came up with similar classifications of 48 separate 41 products . The Kappa value increased significantly between the two experiments . All of the Kappa values shown in are above the strong agreement value of 0 . 6 . Table 4 . 10 – Closed Card Sorting Cohen’s Kappa Values Classifications R1 – R3 R1 – R4 R3 – R4 Materials 0 . 96 0 . 74 0 . 75 Machines 0 . 86 0 . 59 0 . 45 Fluid Dynamics 0 . 85 0 . 52 0 . 60 Heat Transfer 1 . 00 0 . 79 0 . 79 Mechanics of Materials 0 . 90 0 . 59 0 . 51 Energy 0 . 86 0 . 75 0 . 82 Overall 0 . 91 0 . 75 0 . 67 4 . 3 . 3 Results The strongest level of agreement occurred between R1 and R3 . There was a Kappa value of 0 . 91 , a large improvement from the 0 . 38 Kappa value calculated in the previous experiment . The other two Kappa values were increased be approximately 0 . 2 . This data shows that the new classifications accurately capture the products , and that the raters are in strong agreement of which classification each product would fall into . Kappa values across the materials , heat transfer , and energy classifications appeared to be in consistent agreement across all three pairs of raters . The remaining three classifications ( machines , fluid dynamics , and mechanics of materials ) had varying levels of agreement . Overall , the agreement between raters was improved once the new set of classifications had been developed . The new set of classifications also allowed for a 42 significant level of agreement between raters ( see Table 4 . 10 ) . Therefore it is accurate to state that this set of classifications correctly captures the set of products . This improvement in Cohen’s Kappa values between the two experiments can be seen in Table 4 . 11 . Table 4 . 11 – Comparison of Cohen’s Kappa Values Raters Round 1 Cohen ' s Kappa Round 2 Cohen ' s Kappa R1 – R3 0 . 38 0 . 91 R1 – R4 0 . 53 0 . 75 R3 – R4 0 . 47 0 . 67 It should be noted that the raters were allowed to classify each product into more than one classification . Therefore one product may fall into multiple classifications . The disagreements between raters were often found in products that were marked as having multiple classifications . The raters would also agree on at least one classification for each product , meaning there may be a desire to place products into primary and secondary classifications . Primary and secondary classifications could be used to further perform classifications on products and find more similarities as more and more inspiring phenomena are discovered . 4 . 3 . 4 Discussion The Cohen’s Kappa values increased between Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 . This verifies that the classification schema is correct and that the raters are able to understand it . The significant level of inter rater agreement suggests that the raters’ 43 classification of products are similar . A higher level of inter rater agreement is desired for use in the database . Exploration of primary and secondary classifications of products is hypothesized to increase the agreement between raters . 4 . 4 Experiment 4 - Primary and Secondary Classifications Accuracy of the database needed to be improved upon and discrepancies between raters needed to be resolved . To reach a higher level of agreement the usefulness of primary and secondary classifications was explored ( see Figure 4 . 5 ) . Separating the classification schema into primary and secondary classification would help to improve the accuracy of classifications , as well as offer more insight into the potential inspirational phenomena . 44 Figure 4 . 5 – Focus of experiment 4 4 . 4 . 1 Method The varying level of Cohen’s Kappa scores inspired the need to classify the products into primary and secondary classifications . Separating classifications into primary and secondary would eliminate some of the classification discrepancies between raters . This experiment was performed by two participants individually . Each participant was allowed to put each product into one primary classification , and multiple secondary classifications . B 1 B 2 B 3 B 4 . . . . B m - 1 B m P 1 P 2 P 3 P 4 . . . . P n - 1 P n Classifications Biological Solutions Engineering Solutions Primary Secondary 45 This experiment was inspired by the fact that many products tend to fall within multiple classifications , and many of the discrepancies between raters were due to these multiple classifications . Overall the raters tended to agree on at least one classification per product , therefore to eliminate any discrepancies the raters were asked to classify based on primary and secondary classifications . Although strong inter rater agreement had already been reached , it was desired that a higher level of agreement was reached to supply a key for future experiments involving student surveys . Primary and secondary classifications would also allow for different combinations of products that would improve the ability to discover similar sets of products . This offers a higher level of variability to the product type as opposed to simply trying to classify products into one classification . This would also improve a designer’s ability to search the product types by combining multiple primary and secondary classifications . It should also be noted that one of the products used in the original classification was translated into two separate products . This was done because it was determined that previously a product family was being examined since they had the same inspiration . For previous experiments combining the products into one family was acceptable since raters were able to classify a product into numerous classifications . However now that the classification scheme was separated into primary and secondary , the different products within the family would have separated primary and secondary classifications . For this experiment 49 products were used . 46 4 . 4 . 2 Data Examination of the results from each participant showed a high level of agreement . Cohen’s Kappa scores were evaluated based on primary , secondary , and overall agreement between the two participants ( see Table 4 . 12 ) . The Cohen’s Kappa values have again increased across the board . The overall Cohen’s Kappa score was calculated to be 0 . 92 , with a 0 . 96 score for the primary , and 0 . 78 for the secondary . Table 4 . 12 – Cohen’s Kappa Values for Primary / Secondary Experiment Classifications Primary Secondary Overall Materials 0 . 96 0 . 83 0 . 96 Machines 1 . 00 0 . 69 0 . 84 Fluid Dynamics 1 . 00 1 . 00 1 . 00 Heat Transfer 1 . 00 1 . 00 1 . 00 Mechanics of Materials 0 . 93 0 . 83 0 . 92 Energy 0 . 79 0 . 62 0 . 73 Overall 0 . 96 0 . 78 0 . 92 4 . 4 . 3 Results The results support the hypothesis that primary and secondary classification of products is an accurate means of representation . There was a stronger agreement within the primary classifications with a lower level of agreement within the secondary classifications . The lower level of agreement within the secondary classifications came from two sources : disagreement of the type of secondary classification , and the number of secondary classifications . On seven separate instances there was one rater that would 47 include a secondary classification that the other rater excluded . However , every time this occurred the raters would still agree on the primary classification . For this reason it is clear that the primary classifications will have a stronger relation to the product . It is believed that this relation is significant since the raters disagreed more often within the secondary classifications . Looking at just the primary classifications , the Cohen’s Kappa value was improved to 0 . 96 , with a perfect Cohen’s Kappa score in three separate classifications . The lowest primary and secondary Kappa scores were realized in the energy classification . The low energy scores can be attributed to the fact that there were not many products that were classified as energy . Therefore due to the low number of energy products , the Cohen’s Kappa was more sensitive to disagreements between raters . This is clear when looking at the raw data because the two raters disagreed on a primary energy classification only once and a secondary energy classification only three times . For the 49 products used this was not a large percentage of the number of products that were classified . 4 . 4 . 4 Discussion The improvement of inter rater reliability verifies the hypothesis that primary and secondary classifications exist within the products . The primary classifications should be used as the main representations of the biological phenomena due to the high level of inter rater reliability ( 0 . 96 ) . Furthermore combinations of primary and secondary classifications can aid in the search and retrieval process . For example a designer faced 48 with the task of designing a new method of capturing solar energy in materials could examine biological phenomena that have a primary relevance to materials and a secondary relevance to energy . This could aid in the quality of inspirations that are returned to the designer . 4 . 5 Experimental Discussions The experiments previously discussed offer many benefits to the classification of biomimetic products for the purpose of aiding engineers in search and retrieval . It can be claimed that designers have the ability to classify products into the problem domain that is being addressed . This also validates that engineers think within problem domains . That is , when designing products an engineer is able to determine what type of product they are developing . One of the first stages of the design process is to understand the problem statement and abstract out to a very basic level [ 1 ] . Some methods of this include very basic functional modeling however an understanding of the type of product being addressed should also be obtained . It was also determined that the classifications accurately reflect the type of problems that engineers address . Three participants individually identified very similar sets of classifications . This assures that the classification schema used from this point forward is an accurate representation of the engineering problems addressed in the corpus of biomimetic products used . Furthermore the experiments verified that engineers have a difficult time understanding which biological phenomena are applicable to certain classifications . The large amount of false negatives show that engineers cannot effectively determine an 49 actual relevance to the engineering realm . Making this connection for engineers will aid in the search and abstraction of the products , and should allow engineers to view the biological descriptions through an engineering perspective . The experiments also displayed that it would be advantageous and more accurate to model the classifications with a primary and secondary tag . The combination of primary and secondary tags would allow the engineers to search for biological phenomena based on multiple criteria , and eventually as the database grows it will aid in narrowing searches so that designers are not overwhelmed with a large number of potential inspirational phenomena that can be difficult to navigate . The results from the four experiments have led to the following conclusions :  The classification schema has been correctly identified for the current list of biomimetic products  The current collection of products have accurately been classified into sets of primary and secondary classifications  The classification approach is a good method of representing biological phenomena for concept inspiration  Engineers have difficulty classifying the biological products into technical classifications These conclusions validate different stages of the proposed classification method . Validation of the model shows its potential for aiding designers in biomimetic design . Based on these conclusions a database was designed and implemented for use . This 50 database serves as a tool for designers to search for biological phenomena relevant to the design problem being addressed . The following chapter discusses the design and implementation of the database . 51 CHAPTER FIVE DATABASE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION This chapter details the design and development of a repository to support the classification based search and retrieval approach discussed in Chapter Four . . With the information obtained from the experiments , the correct data modeling could be performed for database development . This section will discuss the data modeling that was performed as well as the implementation of the database . This database will accurately reflect data that is useful to aid engineers in search and retrieval of potential sources of inspiration . The classification based method , presented in Chapter Three and validated in Chapter Four , can be transferred to an Entity Relationship diagram that will enable the desired search retrievals . The database should be designed such that it allows designers numerous options for search and retrieval of potential sources of inspiration . The following user search retrievals were determined to be necessary in the database :  Search for biological phenomena based on classification ( primary / secondary )  Search for products based on classification ( primary / secondary )  Discover the inspirational phenomena for a specified product  Discover the classification for a specified product 52  Search for related biological phenomena based on a specified product Knowing the necessary functionality of the database , the data was modeled to allow for this functionality , as well as follow basic database development strategies . The database design and development lead to the BIOMIMETIC INNOVATION REPOSITORY FOR DESIGN ( BIRD ) . BIRD is a knowledge representation for organizing and discovering inspirational biological phenomena for engineering problems . This web - based repository allows for users to search for biological phenomena as well as existing bio - inspired products for design application . Further , the interface allows for new products and phenomena to be added as users continue to find more biomimetic innovations . 5 . 1 Classical Database Development The development of BIRD will follow the classical database development method . The development follows a four phase process from requirement analysis through implementation ( see Figure 5 . 1 ) . Each stage in this development will be discussed in subsequent sections . 53 Figure 5 . 1 – Classical Database Development Model 5 . 1 . 1 Repository Requirement Analysis The first phase of the traditional database development method provides the high - level overview of the database system . In particular , the overall system design and the information flow diagram are provided . The overall system design will show the interface views involved with the system . Two interfaces are used in the database , the web based interface should allow the general users to read information that has already been entered into the database , as well as enter new products that have been discovered . Administrators have access to the database through the back end client phpMyAdmin and can adjust information such as classification definitions , and production phases . The user system provides a web - based interface for accessing the repository . This system allows users to search the database for biological processes and bio - inspired products and add Information Flow Diagram ER Diagram Tasks Relational Platform PHP Code w / SQL Relational Schema Abstract code w / SQL 1 2b 2a 4a 4b 3a 3b 1 . Requirements Analysis 2 . Specification 3 . Design 4 . Implementation 54 new products and processes . There are two types of intended users of BIRD . The first users are engineers that are searching for products and sources of inspiration . This type of user is the target audience of BIRD , and the main focus of this research . The second user is one that will aid in the expansion of the biological solutions to present engineers with a larger collection of possible inspirations . An Information Flow diagram was created to understand the various search retrievals within the system ( Appendix A ) ; however it was more important to understand the types of queries that would be required as well as the types of access to the database . The database is modeled to collect the information gathered by the experiments in Chapter Four ( see Figure 5 . 2 ) and enable the associated query functions . 55 Figure 5 . 2 – Overall system captured by BIRD 5 . 1 . 1 . 1 Searching for products based on classification Engineers currently search databases such as the Design Repository to discover engineering solutions based on a specific functionality . BIRD enables a similar type of query by returning biomimetic solutions that have already been discovered based on a classification ( see Figure 5 . 3 ) . The query enters the database , and discovers all the product relationships for a classification ( primary or secondary ) and returns them to the user . Note that this functionality can also search for multiple classification criterions . BIRD 56 For example BIRD can be queried for products that have a primary classification of materials and secondary classifications of energy and fluid dynamics . Figure 5 . 3 – Query of database for products given a classification 5 . 1 . 1 . 2 Searching for processes based on classification The database also enables engineers to search for biological phenomena based on their associated classifications . The phenomena that are returned include a set of inspirational phenomena as well as non - inspirational phenomena . The non - inspirational phenomena are found using similarities in biological descriptions and will be discussed BIRD Search Return 57 later in the chapter . For this query the user would select a classification ( or numerous classifications ) and would be returned the associated biological phenomena ( see Figure 5 . 4 ) . Figure 5 . 4 – Query of database for processes given a classification 5 . 1 . 1 . 3 Discovering inspirational phenomena for a specified product Another desired functionality of BIRD is the ability to discover a product’s inspirational phenomena . The relationship between an inspirational phenomena and its BIRD Search Return 58 inspired product should also be easy to discover . This is done by relating each inspirational product directly to the product that it has inspired . Creating this relation also allows for the classification of inspirational phenomena to be performed easily . This will be discussed further in Section 5 . 1 . 2 . BIRD allows engineers to search for the inspirational phenomena for each product in the database ( see Figure 5 . 5 ) . Figure 5 . 5 – Query of database for inspirational process for a specific product BIRD Search Return 59 5 . 1 . 1 . 4 Searching for related biological phenomena based on a specified product The final necessary query is an extension of the previous query . As the database expands more biological phenomena will be inserted into the biological solutions . It is necessary to find a means of relating these biological solutions to the products and classifications . A relationship between the inspirational and non - inspirational phenomena will be established , which will indirectly relate the new phenomena to bio - products and engineering classifications ( see Figure 5 . 6 ) . Research surrounding the means to provide this relation is currently being performed . It is believed that methods such as TF - IDF and Artificial Neural Net training would be desirable since this will remove subjectivity in the relationships . Other means of discovering relationships could include having experts in biology perform relate processes , or providing a set of classifications for biological processes such as means of locomotion or types of skin . 60 Figure 5 . 6 – Query for non - inspirational processes based on a given product 5 . 1 . 2 Repository Specification The system specification phase will begin to detail the structure of BIRD . In particular , the ER model and task definitions are provided . The ER model will show what data will be captured by the requirement submission database system . An ER model portrays information regarding the types of data as well as the relationships between the data . In an ER model an entity is displayed with a box . An entity is a noun and BIRD Search Return 61 represents an important element of the data that is being modeled . For example some entities within BIRD are products , classifications , and biological processes . Each entity has numerous attributes associated with it , and they are represented by circular shape . Primary key attributes are used as unique identifiers for each entity and are represented by an underlined text . Attributes are descriptive information surrounding an entity . For example , for the entity “person” some attributes may be “name” , “gender” , “age” , or “social security number” . Note that there can be a large number of attributes for each entity . For this reason it is important to capture the attributes that are important to the data modeling . When modeling the data for BIRD it was determined that the products should be at the center of the data modeling . The experiments examined information related to the product . For this reason most of the entities have a relation to the “bio - product” entity . The final information captured in an ER diagram is the relationships between entities . Relationships are represented by diamonds in an ER diagram . Relationships reflect information between entities that is necessary for the database . In this database one relationship may be between bio - products and their respective classifications . Relationships can have multiple cardinalities that reflect the type of relationship present between the entities . For example , a bio - product is only allowed to have one primary classification but can have multiple secondary classifications . Therefore the relationship between primary classifications and bio - products is n : 1 meaning one bio - product can have one primary classifications , while a primary classification can have n products in it . The relationship between secondary classifications and bio - products is n : m meaning one 62 bio - product can have “m” secondary classifications and one secondary classification can have “n” bio - products . The ER model accurately captures all the information necessary for the desired search retrievals of the database ( see Figure 5 . 7 ) . Figure 5 . 7 – ER model for BIRD Each entity and associated attributes were carefully selected to allow for the search and retrieval of the system ( see Table 5 . 1 ) . The system was also designed to allow for database expansion . It is believed that future work will focus on improving the organizational structure of the biological phenomena . The database design allows for ease of model improvement .

Cannot be altered by users Engineers Phase Name Description Patent Patent ID A listing of the patent numbers for each bio - product ( if a patent exists ) . Each product can have numerous patents . Can be entered by users . Engineers Patent Name 64 The experiments output a set of classified products . Since a product has a classification , as well as an inspirational product , users can then search for inspirational products through this relationship . New “non - inspirational” processes can be added to the database and related to other biological processes . Since the new biological process is related to an original inspirational biological process , the new process may have some application within the same classification ( see Figure 5 . 8 ) . This allows for the database to be expanded once identification of new possible inspirations can be discovered . Figure 5 . 8 – Relation of “non - inspirational” biological processes to classifications . The solid arrows represent an attributed inspiration , and a dashed arrow represents a potential inspiration due to similarities Classifications Biological Solutions Inspirational Potentially Inspirational 65 5 . 1 . 3 Repository Design The repository design begins to create abstract code based heavily on the SQL queries . The MySQL code reflects the desired functionality of the tool , and will be directly implemented in the next stage through PHP . Transforming the desired searches as well as the insertion functions into MySQL is the most important step in the database design . Once the desired searches and insertion statements were finalized they were transferred into an abstract MySQL code . MySQL is a fairly robust and user friendly language , that involves simple statements such as “SELECT * FROM ` bio - product ` WHERE name = ‘Velcro™’” . This statement would select the entire row of data , for Velcro™ , from the bio - product table . MySQL also has INSERT , UPDATE , DELETE , and many more simple functions for database development . From the ER model a relational schema is created for insertion of data regarding the various entities . The relational schema creates the desired tables in the database to reflect the ER diagram ( see Table 5 . 2 through Table 5 . 10 ) . These tables capture the attributes and relations of entities . The relational schema can be changed by administrators as the database develops further and more information must be captured . The implementation stage will involve the actual coding through PHP , and add aesthetics and user friendly design to the database to improve the ease of navigation for users . The relational schema provides the structure of the database , and determines where information is going to be captured . Relations of the cardinality n : 1 can be captured by placing the primary key of one entity and placing it in a field in the corresponding 66 entity’s table . This can be seen in the table for “bio - product” . The ER diagram shows that the bio - product has an n : 1 relationship with primary classifications , and inspirational processes . Therefore the primary IDs of both these entities are captured in the “bio - product” table , thus capturing the relation ( see Table 5 . 2 ) .

For example “bio - products” and “companies” have an n : m relationship . Therefore when a relationship between a “bio - product” and a “company” is determined , the primary keys of each entity are placed in the “bio - product _ has _ company” table ( see Table 5 . 7 ) .

A screenshot of the homepage is provided in Figure 5 . 9 . The navigation bar on the left enables users to access the different aspects of BIRD . The links are separated by entity : product , bio process , and classification . The relations link provides a guided search of the database based upon the user inputs . 69 Figure 5 . 9 – Screenshot of BIRD Homepage The Products page provides the users with the options to view all products , insert products into the database , or relate products to processes . Viewing all products provides users with the full list of products . This provides the name and description of all products in BIRD . The products page also provides users with the ability to insert new products into the database ( see Figure 5 . 10 ) . This allows BIRD to stay updated with current research and developments in biomimetic design . BIRD requires all fields except the patent number in order to accept the submission . The last Products page allows a product to be related to a process . This relation adds additional functionality when searching the database . Two products are selected from the dropdown menus to create the relationship within the database . 70 Figure 5 . 10 – Screenshot of insert products page The Bio - Processes pages contain similar functionality as the Products pages . The Bio Processes page provides allows users to view all processes , insert new processes , or relate processes to one another . Viewing all processes returns a list of all the biological processes captured by BIRD . The Processes page also provides users with the ability to insert new processes into the database . It is required that the user input both the name 71 and a description of the process . The last Processes page allows two processes to be related to one another . This relation adds additional functionality when searching the database . Two products are selected from the dropdown menus to create the relationship within the database . The relations page provides users with a guided search of the repository . Four options are provided . Users may :  View the products of a selected classification  View the classifications of a selected product  View the processes of a selected classification  View the processes of a selected product These searches allow users to utilize BIRD as a tool for design inspiration . Whether a designer is curious about a product , a process or a classification , the customized searches provide insight into biomimetics ( see Figure 5 . 11 ) . shows a screenshot of the relations page . 72 Figure 5 . 11 – Screenshot of the relations page 5 . 2 Validation A validation of BIRD was performed to show the contribution of the work and the usefulness of the problem based classification schema . Participants were given a simple design problem and asked to find biological solutions applicable to the problem . The participants were tasked with designing a product that reduced the amount of drag on a 73 submarine . Participants were then told to navigate the problem based classification schema of BIRD , and the Biomimcry taxonomy of AskNature and find the biological solutions they would pursue further to solve the design problem . Participants were afterwards given the entire list of processes in the database and asked to select the bioprocesses that they would pursue further to solve the design problem . The participants’ button clicking and amount of time required to discover applicable phenomena were tracked ( see Figure 5 . 12 and Figure 5 . 13 ) . The average difference in button clicks and time per search was calculated . A dependent t - test was used to determine if the difference was statistically significant between the two tools . The use of a dependent t - test is valid because each participant used both websites to perform the search ; therefore the results were paired samples dependent on the participant . The t - test showed with 95 % confidence that BIRD required less button clicking , and with 94 % confidence the BIRD took less time to perform the search . This shows that classification schema for BIRD is more intuitive for engineers for search and retrieval . Participants were often switching between classifications in the Biomimcry Taxonomy and had a difficult time managing the database . 74 Figure 5 . 12 – Number of button clicks to search for relevant solutions Figure 5 . 13 – Total time to search for relevant solutions 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 1 2 3 4 5 B u tt o n C li c k s Participant AskNature BIRD 0 50 100 150 200 250 1 2 3 4 5 T i m e ( s ec o nd s ) Participant AskNature BIRD 75 Once a list of biological processes was returned , the participants were asked to determine which processes they believed were relevant to the design problem . Based on the relevance , precision could be calculated for each website . Precision is defined as the percentage of selected results returned by the search . Figure 5 . 14 – Comparison of precision between AskNature and BIRD BIRD produced more precise results for the design problem than AskNature . Specifically for the experiment precision examines the percentage of solutions within a selected classification ( either for BIRD or AskNature ) that are relevant to the design problem at hand . Less precise results are inefficient and could cause designers to become overwhelmed with the large number of irrelevant results . The structure of BIRD offers designers with a more applicable means of search and retrieval for solutions to design problems . 0 % 10 % 20 % 30 % 40 % 50 % 60 % 70 % 1 2 3 4 5 Participant AskNature BIRD 76 Furthermore the recall for BIRD could be calculated based on the number of relevant biological phenomena returned in a search and the number of relevant biological processes in the BIRD database . Recall is defined as the percentage of results returned based on the total number of relevant results in the database . The total number of relevant results was taken from the participants selections when they were given the entire list of processes that were available in BIRD . This method was chosen since different designers would chose different processes as a means of inspiration . Therefore , the desired relevant processes would vary for each designer and desirably all of these would be returned through the search process . Three different search methods were used for the design problem ; however the recall of relevant phenomena remained high for each search method ( see Table 5 . 11 ) . Table 5 . 11 – Participants search method and recall for design problem Participant Primary Search Secondary Search Recall 1 Fluid Dynamics Materials 100 % 2 Fluid Dynamics NULL 100 % 3 Fluid Dynamics NULL 100 % 4 Fluid Dynamics Materials 100 % 5 Fluid Dynamics Energy 88 % The high amount of recall shows that the classifications are useful to the engineer for searching , and that the data is correctly modeled within the database . Each of the participants realized that Fluid Dynamics would be the primary classification for the design problem , and even though multiple selections were made for the secondary classification , a high recall existed across participants . The database has also shown 77 robustness as three different searches were used , and each participant identified a different set of processes in the database they deemed relevant . Based on the participants search methods , these particular results were returned ( see Figure 5 . 15 ) . Figure 5 . 15 – Comparison of results for each participant . Green represents the total number of applicable processes within BIRD . Red represents the number of those applicable process returned by the search , and Blue represents the number of those processes the participant chose to pursue for the design problem . Participants described BIRD as easy to use and navigate , as well as intuitive to the design problem that they were tasked with . The comparison with AskNature shows that BIRD improves designers’ abilities to search for relevant biological phenomena when tasked with a design problem . It has also shown that the database has been correctly modeled to 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 N u m b er o f P r o ce ss e s Participant ApplicableChosen ApplicableReturned Totalapplicable 78 return the applicable products . A high percentage of recall and precision was produced for the given design problem which aids designers in selecting applicable biological processes . 5 . 3 Conclusion BIRD is a design support tool for biomimetic design . This repository allows designers to both gain inspiration from the repository as well as add inspiration . This report follows the development of BIRD from requirement analysis through implementation . Following the classical database development method provided a systematic way to design the repository . The phases provided guidance throughout the process for efficiency and quality . Completing the IF diagram provided a foundation that organized the requirements of the repository . The ER diagram and Task Definitions provided structure for the repository . The relations were then created and organized in third normal form for efficient use of resources . Finally , BIRD was deployed as a web - based repository using an Apache webserver , MySQL database server , and PHP / HTML . 79 CHAPTER SIX CONCLUSION This research has developed a classification approach for potential sources of biological inspiration into engineering classifications to aid engineers in realizing biomimetic solutions in the conceptual design stage . Furthermore a tool has been developed that improves a designer’s ability to search and retrieve these sources of inspiration . The contributions of this work are as follows :  A method for classifying biomimetic products and therefore inspirational phenomena has been developed . This classification approach utilizes primary and secondary classification of products and can be transferred to their inspirational phenomena . Furthermore the biological phenomena can be related to one another to create a larger source for inspiration .  An appropriate set of classifications have been developed through numerous experiments . These classifications are based on engineering problem domains and provide designers with a means of discovering inspirational phenomena based on the type of classifications .  A web based tool has been implemented that allows designers various methods of searching for sources of inspiration during the design process . Specifically designers can search for products based on the type of product they are designing through combinations of primary and secondary 80 classifications . Also biological phenomena can be searched for based on the type of problem being addressed , or through its relation to an already realized biomimetic product . Users can also discover the classification of a realized product .  The web based tool has been proven to ease a designers’ ability to realize potential sources of inspiration for biomimetic design . This will make it easier for designers to search for and realize analogies between the biological and technical realms . These contributions address the gaps in literature that were determined in Table 2 . 1 . The contributions of this work should allow engineers a means of performing forward engineering in biomimetic design . This will mitigate the elements of chance discovery as well as solution driven products . Biomimetic design is an expanding field that will benefit greatly from an engineering based classification approach . This will allow designers to search for solutions based on the type of problem they are addressing . This creates an easy means of discovery of inspirational phenomena . It also allows designers to view the inspirational phenomena through the perspective of the problem that they are addressing . This is important as it may be difficult for engineers to understand the biological language . Providing designers with an engineering perspective to view the biological descriptions will aid in the ability to draw analogies between the biological realm and the technical realm . 81 Future work will focus on the biological processes and a means of finding similarities between the processes . Currently work has been performed exploring TF - IDF tagging and the training of Artificial Neural Nets to realize these similarities . This method would allow for the automatic retrieval of biological process from large banks of information such as biological texts and information available on the web . Other means of finding similarities between biological descriptions include determining a classification of biological processes based on criteria such as methods of locomotion , skin types , and other descriptive means of classifying the types of biological solutions . This method or collaboration with experts in biology would allow relationships between processes to be formed . A drawback to this method is that it introduces a factor of subjectivity to the relational process . The most desirable solution is one that would remove subjectivity completely and would allow for automatic retrieval of phenomena . For this reason it is believed that a form of text mining and combined with machine learning would be the most desirable . Future work will examine the benefits of a search bar in BIRD . Terms can be linked to certain classifications and then used for searching for products or processes . These terms can be discovered through key term tagging such as those used by popular search engines such as Google© . It was determined that this was one of the useful functions of the AskNature website that users found particularly helpful . The use of a search bar is believed to be a natural form of searching for many web - based tools and would improve the ease of use of BIRD . 82 The tool BIRD was developed to enable users to search for sources of biological inspiration based on engineering problem types . This allows designers to perform forward engineering by realizing what type of problem they are addressing and searching based on this criteria . This aids designers in the search and retrieval of concepts within the design process . Furthermore , the classification schema has been validated as an appropriate method of information modeling and can be applied to future instances of biomimetic design . 83 REFERENCES [ 1 ] Pahl G . , and Beitz W . , 2007 , Engineering Design : a systematic approach , Springer .
