The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between neurovascular indices and cognitive changes after CEA . Methods : We studied 55 patients with severe (  70 % ) symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis before and six months after CEA . A wide array of neuropsychological tests was arranged in eight cognitive domains and cognitive functions specific to hemisphere ipsilateral to operation . Differences in cognitive performance between patients and 38 matching healthy controls were studied with linear mixed models . Neurovascular functioning and microembolic signals were assessed with transcranial Doppler ultrasound of the middle cerebral artery . Associations between neurovascular indices and cognitive change were assessed with linear regression analyses . Results : On group level , the CEA patients improved more than controls in working memory , whereas no cognitive deterioration was detected . Also on individual level , improvement was most frequently observed in working memory . Worse preoperative cerebrovascular reactivity was related with improvement in cognitive functions of the ipsilateral hemisphere . Low preoperative pulsatility index was associated with improvement in executive functioning and ipsilateral cognitive functions . Poorer preoperative blood flow velocity associated with improvement in complex attention . Microembolic signals were rare . Conclusion : The present findings suggest that CEA may have beneficial long - term effects on cognition . These effects may specifically involve patients with impaired preoperative circulatory adaptive mechanisms .

The commonly suggested underlying mechanisms are hemodynamic impairment caused by the stenotic lesion as well as continuous silent embolization from the atherosclerotic plaque , with more evidence supporting the former ( 1 , 3 ) . The protective mechanisms against hypoperfusion caused by carotid stenosis are both anatomical and physiological : redistribution of blood flow through collateralization , which is dependent on individually variable anatomy , and physiological compensation within the vasculature through autoregulation . Autoregulation refers to changes in vascular resistance , mainly by arterial contraction or dilatation , as a response to varying blood pressure ( 4 ) . When carotid stenosis starts to diminish blood flow , cerebral arteries adapt to the lowered blood supply and pressure by reducing vascular resistance . Transcranial Doppler ultrasound of cerebral arteries ( TCD ) ( 5 ) is an accessible noninvasive bedside technique which can provide versatile information on effects of carotid stenosis on brain vasculature . The middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) mean blood flow velocity ( MFV ) corresponds roughly to changes in absolute cerebral blood flow ( 6 , 7 ) which the progression of carotid stenosis will ultimately decrease . The pulsatility index ( PI ) is a measure of vascular resistance distal to examined artery , calculated as the difference between peak systolic velocity ( PSV ) and minimal diastolic velocity ( EDV ) divided by MFV ( PI = ( PSV − EDV ) / MFV ) ( 8 , 9 ) . Both high and low PI measures may be considered as indicators for disorders . On the one hand , increasing arterial stiffness results in increment of vascular resistance and PI values ( 10 ) . On the other hand , the brain may try to reduce vascular resistance to compensate for inadequate circulation e . g . , in the case of carotid stenosis . Thus , low PI values may correspond to hypoperfusion of the brain . Cerebrovascular reactivity ( CVR ) , i . e . , the vasomotor response to changes in gaseous blood levels , is another way to assess hemodynamic reserve of the brain . It is usually measured with either the breath - holding index ( BHI ; reactivity to breath - holding for at least 30 seconds ) ( 11 , 12 ) , carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) reactivity ( reactivity to inhaled CO 2 ) ( 13 ) , common carotid artery compression ( 14 ) or reactivity to acetazolamide administration ( Diamox test ) ( 15 , 16 ) . If cerebral arteries are maximally dilated due to constant decrease in cerebral blood flow , cerebrovascular reactivity will become exhausted ( 11 ) . TCD is also used to record microembolization from the atherosclerotic carotid plaque to cerebral circulation , which has been shown to associate with stroke risk in carotid stenosis patients ( 17 , 18 ) . The standard treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis is carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) which is well established for stroke prevention ( 19 – 21 ) . However , the reversibility of cognitive decline and prospect of cognitive change are less clear , as reviewed by several authors ( 22 – 29 ) . Hence , carotid endarterectomy is not recommended for the prevention of cognitive impairment ( 29 ) . There is some evidence from earlier studies that TCD indices of arterial flow , autoregulation and cerebrovascular reactivity may at least partly explain why some patients show cognitive benefit from CEA and others do not ( 30 – 33 ) , but in all studies these associations have not been found ( 34 ) . We are aware of only one study examining the associations between preoperative microembolization and postoperative cognitive change after CEA , with no significant associations found ( 35 ) , and no studies investigating postoperative change in microembolization in the context of cognitive change after CEA . In sum , cerebrovascular measures of cerebral blood flow , autoregulation and cerebrovascular reactivity seem potential candidates to explain and predict postoperative cognitive changes after CEA , but more systematic understanding of how cerebrovascular functioning contributes to domain - wise cognitive performance in a steady phase after CEA is still lacking . J ou r na l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof 4 We studied neurovascular functioning together with a comprehensive cognitive assessment before and six months after CEA in patients with a severe carotid stenosis to evaluate their significance in domain - specific cognitive change . The primary outcome measure was domain - wise cognitive change between pre - and postoperative assessments . A set of neurovascular parameters served as secondary outcome measures . Based on our earlier findings ( 36 ) , and considering the vulnerability of especially anterior brain regions in case of carotid hypoperfusion , we hypothesized that cognitive domains most dependent on frontal networks would be the first to show association with hemodynamic indices . 2 Materials and Methods 2 . 1 Setting This study was performed as a prospective substudy of the Helsinki Carotid Endarterectomy Study 2 ( 37 ) – Brain and Eye Substudy ( HeCES - BEST ) . The data was collected in Helsinki University Hospital , Helsinki , Finland between March 2015 and December 2018 . The study was approved by the local ethical committee and performed according to the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki . 2 . 2 Participants The number of participants in each assessment is shown in Figure 1 . We studied 58 consecutive , independent Finnish - speaking elective carotid endarterectomy patients exhibiting severe (  70 % ) carotid stenosis in computed tomography angiography ( CTA ) according to North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial ( NASCET ) criteria ( 38 ) . Both asymptomatic and symptomatic ( amaurosis fugax , reduced visual acuity , or transient ischemic attack ; TIA ) patients were included . We excluded patients with evidence for cerebral stroke ( focal symptoms or signs of infarct on computed tomography scan ; CT ) within six months to avoid the possibility that observed cognitive change after CEA would be related to rehabilitation from stroke rather than CEA per se . Other exclusion criteria were major psychiatric diseases requiring continuous treatment , substance abuse , contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) or Mini - Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) score < 25 . Of the original study population , three subjects missed the six - month assessment and were excluded from the final study population : one patient was excluded because of postoperative cerebral stroke , one failed to respond to contact and one declined . Thus , the final study population comprised 55 patients . All participants gave written informed consent . The patients were examined prior to CEA ( range 1 - 79 days , median 2 days ; the operation of one subject was postponed because of hematological illness ) and on average six months ( range 131 - 273 days , median 181 days ) after CEA with neuropsychological assessment , TCD ultrasound of cerebral arteries and a three - tesla MRI of the brain . The control group consisted of 38 healthy nonmedicated subjects with no history or signs of potential cardiovascular , neurological , inflammatory , or metabolic disease , major psychiatric morbidity or substance abuse . The controls , matched with the patients for age , gender , education level and occupation level , performed neuropsychological assessments at same intervals as the patients ( range 159 - 222 days between assessments , median 180 days ) . In control subjects , MRI and J ou r na l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof 5 TCD assessments were performed only at baseline . Carotid ultrasonography was used to rule out carotid stenosis in controls . Figure 1 . Patients and controls in each assesement . TCD , Transcranial Doppler ultrasound of cerebral arteries ; MES ' s , microembolic signals . * Assessed upon availability of personnel and TCD facilities . 2 . 3 Surgical procedure CEA was performed with standardized routine by experienced vascular surgeons , mostly by one of the authors ( PV ) . Local anesthesia was preferred . Shunting was performed if the patient developed symptoms in local anesthesia or there was a significant drop in the TCD velocity in the general anesthesia patients . NIRS and TCD were used as cerebral monitoring on top of local anesthesia . CEA routinely lasted 60 - 90 minutes and internal carotid artery closure times varied between 15 and 30 minutes . Patch closure was the preferred technique . Target blood pressure value was above systolic 170 mmHg during closure and below 150 mmHg upon opening . As a completion control , we used transit time flow measurement and selective ultrasound control . There were no perioperative or 90 - day complications among the included patients . Further details of the CEA procedure have been described earlier ( 37 ) . 2 . 4 Baseline characteristics We scored education into three levels according to the Finnish educational system : basic level ( compulsory education ; 6 – 9 years ) , middle level ( vocational training , matriculation examination and / or bachelor’s degree ; 8 – 15 years ) , or higher level ( university level master’s degree or higher ; minimum 16 years ) . Occupation was scored based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations ( ISCO - 08 ) occupational skill levels on a four - code scale , one referring to simple physical J ou r na l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof 6 or manual routine tasks and four to tasks that require complex problem solving and decision making based on extensive theoretical knowledge in a specialized field ( 39 ) . Cardiovascular risk factors such as diagnosis of diabetes , hypertension or hypercholesterolemia , statin use ( more than three months regular use prior to baseline ) , smoking ( smoker / quit smoking within one year or non - smoker / quit smoking more than one year before ) , alcohol consumption ( Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test AUDIT ) ( 40 ) , low physical activity ( less than recommendations ) and body mass index ( BMI ) were recorded . Depressive symptoms and anxiety were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale ( HADS ) ( 41 ) . 2 . 5 Neuropsychological assessment The comprehensive neuropsychological test battery , shown in Table 1 , included both computerized and classical paper - pencil tests . Computerized tests included subtests from the CogState battery ( www . cogstate . com ) ( 42 ) and from a novel Flexible Attention Test ( FAT ) developed by Dr . Paajanen at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health ( 43 , 44 ) . The neuropsychological battery comprised multiple tests arranged in eight cognitive domains : working memory , complex attention , executive functioning , learning , delayed memory , reasoning , speed and motor dexterity . In addition , we composed a separate domain of ipsilateral cognitive functions consisting of verbal tests for patients with CEA on the left side and visual tests for patients with CEA on the right side . Ipsilateral cognitive functions were not determined for controls who were not operated with CEA . The same neuropsychologist assessed each participant and parallel memory test versions in variable order were used in repeated measurements to minimize learning effects .

Of this subpopulation , 39 patients were assessed J ou r na l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof 8 also 6 months postoperatively . In control subjects , TCD assessments were performed only at baseline . TCD examinations were performed according to a standardized routine in the same place in the afternoon hours . The participants were asked to refrain from smoking and coffee in the preceding hours . After the instructions they were allowed to rest for five minutes in supine position before blood pressure and TCD measurements . The cerebral arteries were insonated through the transtemporal window using SonaraTek device ( SONARA™ Viasys Healthcare , USA ) with a hand - held 2MHz PW transducer by an experienced ultrasonographer using a standardized protocol . The highest flow parameters and PIs in the first segment of each cerebral artery were recorded at the end of the resting period during normal spontaneous inhalation of room air . The BHI test was performed as described earlier ( 11 ) . Three 30 - second breath - holding episodes with 3 - minute breaks were recorded , and the mean value of two technically best measurements was used . In 22 patients preoperatively and 21 postoperatively as well as 3 controls the BHI measurements were not successful either due to their inability to perform the 30 - second apnea reliably or the relative insufficiency of the transtemporal window , or registrations were not available due to a storage error which prevented their retrieval and blinded re - analysis . We used the following TCD variables to assess pre - and postoperative hemodynamics of ipsilateral MCA : ipsilateral BHI , ratio of ipsilateral and contralateral MFV and ipsilateral PI < 0 . 8 ( 30 ) . In addition , contralateral PI in patients with no  70 % stenoses in contralateral carotid artery was used as an index of general arterial stiffness and vascular resistance . Postoperative change in hemodynamics was assessed with change scores in ipsilateral BHI and ratio of ipsilateral and contralateral MFV . For the controls , we used the mean of right and left MFV and PI values . A subpopulation of 30 patients was assessed preoperatively and 26 patients postoperatively ( 18 patients both pre - and postoperatively ) for microembolic signals ( MES ) upon availability of personnel and TCD facilities , with an ambulatory registration of ipsilateral MCA flow with a portable device ( Atys TCD - X , Atys Medical , Soucieu - en - Jarrest , France ) . We excluded 3 measurements due to analyzable recording times below 30 minutes , resulting in 28 preoperative and 25 postoperative measurements . Median analyzable recording time was 1 h 57 min ( range 45 min – 3 hours 8 minutes ) . 2 . 7 Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS 25 and 28 . We standardized the neuropsychological test results relative to the controls’ baseline performance and inverted timed z - scores so that negative z - scores always indicated inferior cognitive performance . Next , we averaged the standardized results within each cognitive domain . All analyses of cognitive performance were carried out within each cognitive domain . P - values below 0 . 05 were counted significant . We used Mann – Whitney U tests , independent samples t - tests , χ² tests , Fisher ' s exact tests , Wilcoxon signed – rank tests and McNemar tests for univariate analyses . Differences between the patient and control groups as well as interactions between group and measurement ( baseline and six months ) in cognitive performance were assessed with linear mixed models adjusting for age , sex and education class . Beforehand , reflection and square root transformation were applied to processing speed and J ou r na l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof 9 reflection and logarithmic transformation to complex attention . We chose compound symmetry as repeated effect covariance structure based on Bayesian information criteria . Significant interactions were assessed post hoc between groups within both measurements with Bonferroni corrected pairwise comparisons based on estimated marginal means . To allow for normal variation and practice effects , we used the reliable change index ( RCI ) ( 54 – 56 ) to assess postoperative cognitive performance within the patient group . Postoperative cognitive decline ( POCD ) and improvement ( POCI ) were defined based on RCI with a cut - off criterion of ±2 . Associations between cardiovascular risk factors , TCD variables and domain - wise RCI were evaluated with separate linear regression models controlling for symptomatic stenosis , age , sex and education class . Beforehand , square root transformation was applied to executive functioning and logarithmic transformation to complex attention . We calculated local effect sizes of statistically significant models with Cohen ' s F 2 based on the R squares of the models ( 57 , 58 ) . Both linear mixed models and regression models were first performed including all patients and then excluding the patients who were bilaterally operated during the follow - up time . 3 Results 3 . 1 Baseline characteristics Baseline characteristics of the patient and control groups are shown in Table 2 . Age , gender , occupational level or education class of the patient population did not differ from the controls ( Table 2 ) .

TIA , transient ischemic attack . Of the patients , 24 ( 44 % ) were asymptomatic and 31 ( 56 % ) symptomatic . Symptoms included amaurosis fugax in 19 ( 35 % ) , hemispheric TIA in 10 ( 18 % ) and reduced visual acuity due to neovascular glaucoma or branch retinal arterial occlusion in 2 ( 4 % ) patients . For practical and logistical reasons , the most urgent patients could not be included in the study . The median delay from index symptom to surgery in symptomatic patients was 12 , 5 days . There were no significant differences in age , sex , education class , occupation level , baseline cognitive performance or postoperative cognitive change in any cognitive domain between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients ( all p - values > 0 . 05 , Mann – Whitney U tests , χ² tests and Fisher’s exact tests ) . The operation was performed on the left side for 33 ( 60 % ) and on the right side for 22 ( 40 % ) patients . Of the patients , 8 had  70 % contralateral stenosis and 4 underwent contralateral CEA J ou r na l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof 11 during the 6 months follow - up time . The bilaterally operated patients did not differ significantly from the other patients in age , sex , education class , occupation level , any cognitive domain at baseline or in domain - wise postoperative cognitive change ( all p - values > 0 . 05 , Mann – Whitney U tests and Fisher’s exact tests ) . The three patients who dropped out of postoperative assessments were inferior to the other patients in baseline motor dexterity ( U = 16 . 00 , p = 0 . 01 , Mann – Whitney U test ) but did not differ from the other patients in age , sex , education class , occupation level or any other cognitive domain at baseline ( all p - values > 0 . 05 , Mann – Whitney U tests and Fisher’s exact tests ) . 3 . 2 Pre - and postoperative cognitive performance between patients and controls Cognitive performance of patients and controls is shown in Table 3 . Results of linear mixed models assessing interactions in cognitive performance between group ( patients and controls ) and measurement ( baseline and six months ) are reported as follows . There was an interaction between group and measurement in working memory ( F ( 1 , 91 ) = 4 . 31 , p = 0 . 04 ) . Post hoc analysis showed that the patient group performed inferior to control group at baseline ( t ( 108 . 77 ) = 0 . 38 , p = 0 . 007 ) but no longer at six months ( t ( 108 . 77 ) = 0 . 19 , p = 0 . 17 ) . When patients who underwent bilateral CEA during follow - up time were removed from analysis , there was a trend in interaction ( F ( 1 , 87 ) = 3 . 12 , p = 0 . 08 ) . There were no other interactions between group and measurement , but there was a significant main effect of group showing inferior performance in patients compared with controls in all remaining cognitive domains : complex attention ( F ( 1 , 86 ) = 5 . 89 , p = 0 . 02 ) , executive functioning ( F ( 1 , 87 ) = 9 . 70 , p = 0 . 003 ) , learning ( F ( 1 , 87 ) = 9 . 54 , p = 0 . 003 ) , delayed memory ( F ( 1 , 87 ) = 5 . 78 , p = 0 . 02 ) , reasoning ( F ( 1 , 87 ) = 11 . 51 , p = 0 . 001 ) , processing speed ( F ( 1 , 87 ) = 13 . 95 , p < 0 . 001 ) and motor dexterity ( F ( 1 , 86 ) = 5 . 64 , p = 0 . 02 , linear mixed models ) . These results remained significant also after excluding bilateral CEA patients ( all p - values < 0 . 05 ) . Table 3 . Cognitive performance of patients and controls .

To sum up , patients exhibited significantly poorer ipsilateral BHI than controls ( U = 166 . 0 , p < 0 . 001 , Mann – Whitney U test ) and there were more patients than controls with low ( < 0 . 8 ) PI at baseline ( p = 0 . 04 , Fisher ' s exact test ) . In addition , the patients with no severe contralateral carotid stenosis had a significantly higher PI value in the contralateral side at baseline than controls ( U = 361 . 5 , p = 0 . 001 , Mann – Whitney U test ) . Looking at neurovascular functioning within patients , ipsilateral PI was significantly increased ( Z = - 3 . 45 , p < 0 . 001 , Wilcoxon signed – rank test ) and there were fewer patients with low ( < 0 . 8 ) ipsilateral PI ( p = 0 . 03 , McNemar test ) at six months compared with baseline .

Each patient exhibiting MES’s was symptomatic , resulting in 16 % symptomatic patients with preoperative MES’s and 30 % symptomatic patients with postoperative MES’s . Due to the small number of patients with MES’s , further analyses were not conducted . 3 . 5 Predictors of postoperative cognitive change There were statistically significant predictors of cognitive change in linear regression analyses in the domains of working memory , complex attention and executive functioning as well as ipsilateral cognitive functions ( Table 6 ) . Hence , other cognitive domains were excluded from further inspection . Looking at cardiovascular risk factors , hypertension was inversely associated with postoperative change in complex attention (  = - 0 . 35 , p = 0 . 04 ) and directly associated with postoperative change in working memory (  = 1 . 01 , p = 0 . 04 ) . The effect sizes in these associations were small ( F² < 0 . 15 ) . The observed trend between hypercholesterolemia and change in executive functioning is subject to unreliability due to a very small proportion of patients without hypercholesterolemia ( four patients ) . Statin use related with postoperative change in executive functioning (  = 0 . 30 , p = 0 . 001 ) , with a moderate effect size ( F² > 0 . 15 ) . After excluding bilaterally operated subjects from analyses , the results remained essentially unchanged , but the association between hypertension and working memory was no longer significant (  = 0 . 90 , p = 0 . 06 ) . Regarding neurovascular parameters , BHI at baseline was inversely related with postoperative change in ipsilateral cognitive functions (  = - 3 . 20 , p = 0 . 01 ) and there was a near - significant inverse trend between BHI at baseline and postoperative change in working memory (  = - 2 . 67 , p = 0 . 06 ) , both with large effect sizes ( F² > 0 . 35 ) . There was an inverse association between preoperative ratio of ipsi - and contralateral MFV and complex attention (  = - 0 . 66 , p = 0 . 046 ) and a trend between postoperative change in ratio of ipsi - and contralateral MFV and executive functioning (  = 0 . 46 , p = 0 . 08 ) , with moderate effect sizes ( F² > 0 . 15 ) . Furthermore , there were significant associations between low preoperative ipsilateral PI and greater improvement in ipsilateral cognitive functions (  = 1 . 70 , p = 0 . 002 ) and executive functioning (  = 0 . 39 , p = 0 . 008 ) with moderate effect sizes ( F² > 0 . 15 ) . When bilaterally operated subjects were excluded from analyses , the results remained mostly unchanged , but the associations between BHI and ipsilateral cognitive functions (  = - 3 . 04 , p = 0 . 08 ) and preoperative ratio of ipsi - and contralateral MFV and complex attention (  = - 0 . 56 , p = 0 . 06 ) no longer reached statistical significance .

J ou r na l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof 18 4 Discussion This study was set out to explore associations between neurovascular mechanisms and cognition in non - stroke carotid patients undergoing CEA . Our results indicate cognitive improvement particularly in working memory . The findings also corroborate the association between indices reflecting arterial flow parameters , autoregulation and cerebrovascular reactivity and postoperative cognitive improvement ( 30 – 33 ) , with an emphasis on the functions of anterior cerebrum and ipsilateral hemisphere . CEA patients as a group improved significantly more than controls in the domain of working memory , whereas no group - level deterioration was observed . Working memory was most frequently improved also on individual level , although the frequencies of domain - wise postoperative cognitive improvement were in general rather low , presumably owing to the adopted strict definition of postoperative cognitive decline and improvement . Notably , after excluding the four patients who were operated on bilaterally during the follow - up , there was only a trend of working memory improvement . Taken together , the present results suggest that working memory may be the most sensitive cognitive domain to postoperative changes after CEA , but on group level , this improvement is modest and more pronounced after bilateral operation . The anterior cerebral cortex , perfused by carotid arteries via the anterior and middle cerebral arteries , subserves both working memory ( 59 ) and other complex cognitive functions such as executive functioning ( 60 ) . Why , then , is working memory in the present study more sensitive to postoperative changes six months after CEA than other cognitive domains ? Methodological reasons may in part explain our findings . We used established neuropsychological tests to assess each cognitive domain , but also modern , probably more sensitive computerized tests were used in the assessment of working memory , complex attention and processing speed . Furthermore , although generally considered as tests of working memory , the computerized N - back tests used in this study also test other cognitive abilities , such as attentional and executive control ( 61 , 62 ) . Indeed , in our previous work of a historical cohort using only traditional paper - and - pencil assessment methods , postoperative cognitive improvement in working memory was rare , whereas executive functioning was the most improved domain in a follow - up time of one week and three months after CEA ( 36 ) . In this light and considering the importance of anterior cerebrum in executive functioning ( 60 ) , it is somewhat surprising that improvement in executive functioning domain was rare in this study . It is probable that inconsistent results are at least partly related to differences in study populations ( proportion of symptomatic patients , index symptoms ) due to study protocols and changes in surgery indications . Differences in follow - up times can hardly explain deviant findings because it is plausible that with increasing cerebral restructuring after restored carotid circulation , cognition would rather improve than deteriorate in later surveillance after CEA ( 22 ) . While the six - month interval for follow - up adopted in the present study allows for both passing of perioperative stress and time for cerebral restructuring , it is possible that cognitive improvement could be even more pronounced at longer surveillance . In sum , the present study implicates that at six months after CEA , cognitive improvement is mainly detected in sensitive tests and demanding performance requiring working memory as well as attentional and executive control . J ou r na l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof 19 In the present study , only few cardiovascular risk factors showed predictive value on postoperative cognitive functioning after CEA . There were contradictory findings on the associations between hypertension and postoperative cognitive change . Continuous ( regularly more than three months prior to baseline ) statin use associated with postoperative change in executive functioning with a moderate effect size . This finding corroborates earlier studies showing an association between statin use and lower incidence of postoperative cognitive decline after CEA ( 63 , 64 ) and presumably reflects vulnerability to postoperative decline in patients with sub - optimally treated cardiovascular disease . Looking at neurovascular functioning , the patients had poorer cerebrovascular reactivity , measured with breath - holding index , than controls at baseline . This result corroborates earlier findings on the association between carotid stenosis and cerebrovascular reactivity ( 65 , 66 ) . Furthermore , there was an association between lower preoperative cerebrovascular reactivity and cognitive improvement six months after CEA , notably with large effect sizes . More specifically , impaired cerebrovascular reactivity associated with improved ipsilateral cognitive functions , corroborating previous findings ( 32 ) , although no longer significantly after excluding bilaterally operated patients . In addition , there was a near - significant trend between impaired cerebrovascular reactivity and improved working memory . There were no significant group - level postoperative changes in patients’ cerebrovascular reactivity , contrasting earlier findings ( 66 – 69 ) , nor were there significant associations between postoperative change in cerebrovascular reactivity and cognitive functioning , also reported earlier ( 31 ) . This discrepancy probably relates to Type II error due to restricted sample size in cerebrovascular reactivity measurement . However , even in a limited cohort , our results suggest a rather robust association between preoperative cerebrovascular reactivity and cognitive change after CEA , particularly in bilaterally operated patients . In contrast to earlier findings ( 70 ) , there were no significant group - level changes in preoperative mean blood flow velocity ( MFV ) between patients and controls , nor in ipsilateral MFV after revascularization within patients . However , looking at individual contrasts in MFV between ipsi - and contralateral hemispheres , we observed an association between lower preoperative ipsilateral MFV and improving complex attention , but it no longer reached significance after excluding bilaterally operated patients . There was also a trend between postoperative improvement in ipsilateral MFV and executive functioning . These results are in accordance with earlier findings at the acute phase , one day after CEA ( 30 ) and further suggest that a simple measure of cerebral blood flow may have some predictive value on postoperative cognitive functioning still at six months after CEA . Reduced vascular resistance , measured with ipsilateral pulsatility index ( PI ) , was common among CEA patients and related with cognitive improvement . Ipsilateral PI was low more often among patients than controls at baseline and increased postoperatively , in line with previous findings ( 70 – 72 ) . Low preoperative PI associated with postoperative improvement in ipsilateral cognitive functions and executive functioning with a moderate effect size . Earlier , an association between low preoperative PI and cognitive improvement has been found at the acute phase after CEA ( 30 ) . Our results further implicate that the association between reduced preoperative ipsilateral vascular resistance and postoperative cognitive improvement is still prevalent at a stable phase after CEA . The patients with no contralateral carotid stenosis had a significantly higher contralateral PI value than controls at baseline , indicating increased vascular resistance related to general vascular stiffness ( 10 ) . The finding is not surprising given the differences in atherosclerotic disease and J ou r na l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof 20 cardiovascular risk factors between patients and healthy controls . Contralateral PI did not associate with postoperative cognitive change , suggesting that the patients’ ability to gain cognitive benefit from CEA is not heavily affected by general arterial stiffness and vascular resistance per se ; rather , it is mediated by hemodynamic changes resulting from the stenosed carotid artery . Microemboli are often proposed as a potential source of cognitive decline in carotid stenosis ( 73 ) but associations between microembolic signals and cognitive functioning in asymptomatic carotid patients ( 74 ) or preoperative microemboli and cognitive change after CEA ( 35 ) have not been found . The paucity of microembolic signals in this study suggests that the hemodynamic changes outweigh their contribution to cognitive change . A larger study would be needed to assess the interplay and synergy between flow parameters and microemboli . The main limitation of the present study is the restricted sample size that may risk Type II error , i . e . , missed associations between potential predicting variables and postoperative cognitive performance . Especially the number of patients undergoing TCD measurements , in particular BHI assessments , was limited . There is also a risk of Type I error due to the exploratory nature of the study with a wealth of uncorrected comparison . Nevertheless , our findings on fairly consistent associations between neurovascular parameters and cognitive performance in a relatively small dataset , with mostly moderate to large effect sizes , implicate their weight in the prediction of postoperative cognitive changes after CEA , overshadowing the predictive power of traditional cardiovascular risk factors . These preliminary results serve guidance to future larger - scale studies towards incorporating vascular physiological parameters among the predictors of domain - wise cognitive change in a stable phase after CEA . There are also methodological limitations in the neurosonological assessment . End - tidal CO 2 concentrations were not monitored during the breath - holding test , which may add to the variability of the results . Another arguable weakness of the present study is that , in contrast to most of the earlier studies studying hemodynamic changes and cognition in CEA patients ( 30 , 33 , 34 ) , both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were included in this study . In order to avoid confusing postoperative cognitive change and spontaneous rehabilitation from stroke , patients with radiological or clinical signs of acute / subacute ischemic stroke were excluded . In addition , for practical and logistical reasons , the more urgent patients were naturally excluded . Hence , the patients included in this study ( 56 % symptomatic patients with no recent strokes , median delay from index symptom to surgery 12 , 5 days ) do not represent the usual severity and distribution of CEA indications in our hospital ( 81 % symptomatic patients , delay from symptom to surgery 12 days ) ( 75 ) . However , it must be noted that cerebrovascular changes are more probable in symptomatic patients who may not have proper collateral circulation to compensate for reduced blood supply from the carotid arteries . Our sample size did not allow for separate analyses within symptomatic and asymptomatic patient groups , but we included symptom status , albeit not significantly associated with either preoperative cognitive level or postoperative cognitive change , in statistical models looking for predictive elements of cognitive change . Notwithstanding these limitations , the present study has considered many of the pitfalls of earlier studies investigating cognitive changes after CEA , pointed out in recent reviews ( 3 , 22 , 76 ) . In contrast to many earlier studies using only screening tests or a limited selection of neuropsychological tests , we used an extensive neuropsychological testing battery organized in multiple well - covered J ou r na l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof 21 cognitive domains , including tests sensitive for functions of both hemispheres . Other strengths include neuropsychological assessments conducted by a specialized neuropsychologist , comparison with a control group and statistical methods used to account for learning effects and the definition of postoperative cognitive decline and improvement , and a long follow - up time . Moreover , this study presents a comprehensive evaluation of neurovascular parameters in relation to cognitive outcome after CEA . 5 Conclusions In conclusion , our study suggests that group - wise cognitive changes at a stable phase , six months after CEA are subtle , with modest improvement of working memory particularly in bilaterally operated patients . Moreover , our findings indicate that neurovascular mechanisms , in particular reduced preoperative cerebrovascular reactivity and vascular resistance , may explain individual differences in postoperative cognitive changes particularly in cognitive functions operated in the ipsilateral hemisphere and anterior cerebrum . Although carotid revascularization cannot in general be recommended based on cognitive expectations , it is possible that patients who benefit cognitively from carotid surgery could be identified by focusing on preoperative neurovascular functioning . Future studies investigating cognitive functioning after carotid revascularization should focus on cognitive functions dependent on frontal networks as well as hemisphere - specific cognitive functions and their relations to preoperative cerebrovascular reactivity and vascular resistance .
