Intentional and serendipitous diffusion of ideas : Evidence from academic conferences Misha Teplitskiy 1 * † , Soya Park 2† , Neil Thompson 2 , 3 , David Karger 2 1 . University of Michigan School of Information 2 . MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory 3 . MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy This paper investigates the effects of seeing ideas presented in - person , even when they are easily accessible online . Presentations may increase the diffusion of ideas intentionally ( when one attends the presentation of an idea of interest ) and serendipitously ( when one sees other ideas presented in the same session ) . We measure these effects in the context of 25 computer science conferences using data from the scheduling application Confer , which lets users browse papers , Like those of interest , and receive schedules of their presentations . We address endogeneity concerns in presentation attendance by exploiting scheduling conflicts : when a user Likes multiple papers that are presented at the same time , she cannot see them both , potentially affecting their diffusion . Estimates show that being able to see presentations increases citing of Liked papers within two years by 1 . 5 percentage points ( 62 . 5 % boost over the baseline rate ) . Attention to Liked papers also spills over to non - Liked papers in the same session , increasing their citing by 0 . 5 percentage points ( 125 % boost ) , and this serendipitous diffusion represents 30 . 5 % of the total effect . Both diffusion types were concentrated among papers semantically close to an attendee’s prior work , suggesting that there are inefficiencies in finding related research that conferences help overcome . Overall , even when ideas are accessible online , in - person presentations substantially increase diffusion , much of it serendipitous . † These authors contributed equally . * To whom correspondence should be addressed : Misha Teplitskiy , tepl @ umich . edu 1 . Introduction Innovators in science and technology often build on the ideas of others by recombining them in novel ways ( Fleming , 2001 ; Uzzi et al . , 2013 ; Weitzman , 1998 ) . Consequently , to understand the rate and direction of innovation it is crucial to understand how innovators encounter and learn others’ ideas , that is how ideas diffuse . Yet idea diffusion is notoriously difficult to study . As Paul Krugman famously quipped , “knowledge flows … are invisible ; they leave no paper trail by which they may be measured and tracked” ( quoted in ( Jaffe et al . , 1993 ) ) . Consequently , scholars have had to make do with indirect or aggregated measures , and key questions about the drivers of diffusion remain open . In particular , a persistent finding in the voluminous literature on diffusion is that its amount and intensity are associated with geographical proximity ( Azoulay et al . , 2011 ; Belenzon & Schankerman , 2013 ; Duede et al . , 2024 ; Jaffe et al . , 1993 ; Kabo et al . , 2014 ; Lin et al . , 2023 ; van der Wouden & Youn , 2023 ; Wuestman et al . , 2019 ) . The association may be caused by a variety of factors ( Boschma , 2005 ) and a robust debate asks whether the primary factor is interpersonal ties between innovators ( Head et al . , 2019 ) , the geographical concentration of related ideas ( Wuestman et al . , 2019 ) , or something else . Scholars also debate at what scale the association is meaningful , if at all ( Thompson & Fox - Kean , 2005 ) , and even if it was meaningful in the past , whether recent technological progress supporting remote communication has made it obsolete ( Head et al . , 2019 ; Presidente & Frey , 2022 ) . A challenge to progress in these debates is that most studies examine data on the outputs of teams , such as patents and research papers , making it difficult to establish processes at the individual - level and that lead up to those outputs . In particular , it is plausible that the effects of geographical proximity on diffusion are driven by the benefits of in - person communication ( Atkin et al . , 2022 ; Azoulay et al . , 2011 ; Torre , 2008 ) relative to online or another modality . The importance of the online modality has only increased with the COVID pandemic and its long - term effects on technology and the nature of work ( Barrero et al . , 2023 ) and a burgeoning literature seeks to understand the multifaceted consequences . Exemplary studies in this area typically randomize individuals to collaborate on and learn ideas either online vs . offline ( Brucks & Levav , 2022 ; Kofoed et al . , 2021 ) . However , increasingly often individuals face an information environment where the same ideas are available online and in - person . It is possible that when online access to ideas exists seeing them communicated in - person adds little if any value . This paper contributes to the debate on geographical proximity and diffusion by assessing the effect of in - person communication of ideas when they are easily accessible online . To do so we use the setting of academic conferences . Conferences are ubiquitous in scientific research and many other industries , and their future has been the subject of significant debate ( Jarvis et al . , 2021 ; Klöwer et al . , 2020 ; Reshef et al . , 2020 ; Thorp , 2020 ) . Besides their intrinsic importance as a method of organizing and communicating ( T . T . Hansen & Budtz Pedersen , 2018 ; Hauss , 2020 ) , conferences provide an attractive setting to study the value - add of in - person communication . In prior decades , researchers looking to read the newest papers could only find them once they were published , via personal connections , or as presentations at conferences and seminars . In that information environment , the choice to attend a conference presentation represented a choice between accessing the information or not . With the growing accessibility of papers online , the choice to attend presentations represents a choice between seeing information presented in - person and accessing it online vs . only accessing it online . Measuring the effect of in - person presentations on diffusion is challenging . First , accumulating evidence of idea diffusion takes time . A researcher may be influenced by a conference presentation that inspires a paper published many years later . Second , researchers do not choose to attend paper presentations at random . This means that the natural comparison group for presentations attended – those not attended - will be on average less relevant or of lower quality . Consequently , when observational studies find that attendees self - report learning important information at presentations , e . g . ( Lalonde et al . , 2007 ) , it is unclear if that outcome would have occurred even without the presentation . We address these challenges with unique data from conferences and a novel identification strategy based on scheduling conflicts . Sometimes , a conference attendee finds that two or more presentations of interest are scheduled at the same time . When these scheduling conflicts occur , the person is on average less able to see either presentation in - person . In this way scheduling conflicts affect attendees’ opportunities to attend presentations , without affecting their online access to the papers . We highlight that this variation is in the opportunities to attend presentations rather than actual attendance , and our research design can be interpreted as yielding intention - to - treat estimates of actual attendance . Thus , if we could instead measure actual attendance , we would expect the effects to be even higher than those we report here . Our main identifying assumption is that , conditional on fixed effects for the user and the presented paper , a person’s scheduling conflicts are plausibly random . In other words , we exploit the variation that a particular person may have a scheduling conflict with a particular paper but another person may not . User and paper fixed effects enable us to avoid confounding the results by a paper’s quality , topic , or position in the overall schedule , or the user’s propensity to Like , attend , or cite papers . We apply this strategy to unique data from the conference scheduling application Confer , which lets attendees screen ( “ Like ” ) papers and generates a personalized schedule of their presentations . The application was deployed at 25 computer science conferences between 2013 - 2022 , and our analytic sample includes 5996 papers , 2481 users , and 83 , 726 Likes . We then identify users of this application in the bibliometric database OpenAlex and track whether they cited the presented papers in their subsequent work . We find that even when individuals have access to papers online , being able to see them in person increases citations within two years by 65 % . Conferences are also an attractive setting to study serendipity . The key role that serendipity has played in the history of many innovations is well documented ( Balzano , 2022 ; Busch , 2022 ; Copeland et al . , 2023 ; Merton & Barber , 2011 ; Simonton , 2004 ; Yaqub , 2018 ) . Evidence is also accumulating that serendipity can to some extent be engineered by exposing innovators to unsought ideas through policy or other exogenous events ( Catalini , 2017 ; Lane et al . , 2021 ; Nahm et al . , 2023 ) . There is much less clarity on how big a role serendipity plays in the normal , everyday conduct of research . Are the colorful historical anecdotes of serendipity swamped by equally colorful but intentional events ? And which serendipitous ideas are likeliest to be taken up ? Studying conferences enables us to contribute to the literature on serendipity by , first , providing a quantitative estimate of its role in diffusion . Many academic conferences present attendees with several tracks and many papers to choose from . Attendees will generally screen papers to select a few of interest , possibly attend those presentations , and utilize some of them in their subsequent work . We refer to this type of diffusion as intentional . Attendees may also encounter papers incidentally . A common type of incidental exposure is when an individual attends a session with a paper of interest and because of decorum or other pragmatic reasons remains in the room for other paper presentations , which she may have earlier screened out or not been aware of . If these unsought papers are later utilized we refer to this as serendipitous diffusion . Following the intuition that attendees are likely to see multiple papers in a session , we focus on the papers a user did not Like but that are presented in the same sessions as Liked papers . We find that when attendees could see sessions with Liked papers , they were 125 % more likely to cite the non - Liked papers . A back - of - the - envelope calculation suggests that this serendipitous diffusion represents 30 . 5 % of the total citations induced by presentations . This estimate shows that even when serendipity is operationalized as one arguably narrow type , it represents a very substantial fraction of the diffusion . Lastly , examining treatment effect heterogeneity illuminates which ideas are likeliest to diffuse through presentations . In particular , we measure the semantic distance between a conference attendee’s papers before the conference and papers they intend to learn about or encounter serendipitously . We find that in both cases the effects are concentrated on papers semantically close to the attendee , with the effect for distant papers statistically indistinguishable from zero . That both intentional and serendipitous effects from prsentations are so important , even for work quite close to an attendees own research , corroborates existing work showing that information frictions in science are substantial ( Azoulay et al . , 2019 ; D . Feenberg et al . , 2016 ) . Furthermore , it suggests that efforts to exogenously expose scientists to semantically distant ideas , for example via interdisciplinary events , may struggle to achieve diffusion . Overall , the study contributes to the debate on what drives the association between geographical proximity and diffusion by examining diffusion in an exceedingly common but rarely studied information environment – where the same ideas are available online and via an in - person modality , in this case presentations . The results show that in - person presentations greatly increase diffusion above the online - access baseline , both by increasing the uptake of ideas one intends to learn about and encounters serendipitously . The rest of this paper is organized as follows . The next section reviews the literature on conferences and states the research questions . Section 3 describes the data and elaborates the identification strategy . Section 4 presents the three sets of results on intention diffusion , serendipitous diffusion , and heterogeneity across semantic distance . Section 5 concludes with limitations and implications . 2 . Diffusion through presentations In this section we review the several mechanisms through which conference presentations may drive diffusion of ideas beyond the level resulting from other communication modalities , in particular online access . We call these mechanisms awareness , engagement , and maturation . Furthermore , we distinguish between ideas that pass an initial screening , or do not pass or were never screened , and call their diffusion intentional or serendipitous , respectively . Lastly , we highlight the importance for diffusion of the semantic distance between an idea and an individual’s existing research . Following existing work , we operationalize the diffusion of academic ideas using citations to papers ( Azoulay et al . , 2011 ; Leon & McQuillin , 2018 ) . Meetings and conferences play a substantial role in science and technology and a growing literature attempts to identify their many functions and consequences ( Atkin et al . , 2022 ; T . T . Hansen & Budtz Pedersen , 2018 ; Hauss , 2020 ) . For example , studies have examined how conferences help attendees network ( Campos et al . , 2018 ; Chai & Freeman , 2019 ; Lane et al . , 2021 ) and crystallize and legitimize new fields ( Garud , 2008 ; Gross & Fleming , 2012 ) . But arguably the most important function of academic conferences is diffusing ideas through presentations . Papers can diffuse through many other channels ; for instance , a study of a random sample of citations found that most originated from researchers searching databases like Google Scholar ( Teplitskiy et al . , 2022 ) . Researchers can and do cite papers without ever seeing them presented , leading to a baseline citation rate . How do conference presentations increase citing above the baseline rate ? The mechanisms will vary with whether papers are screened - in or not . Individuals generally do not choose to attend presentations at random , but first screen them , for example by reading an abstract , and attend those that are screened - in . Consequently , individuals will have at least superficial knowledge , i . e . awareness , of screened - in papers . Presentations may increase citing of screened - in papers by , first , improving engagement . A person may encounter an interesting abstract at a conference or elsewhere and plan to read the paper later but fail to execute the plan ( Buehler et al . , 1994 ) . In - person conference presentations help execute the plan by providing a commitment mechanism ( Bryan et al . , 2010 ) : the decision to attend a conference in the first place , often made long in advance of it , largely commits the individual to go , the concreteness and immediacy of the presentation’s schedule may provide additional commitment ( Trope & Liberman , 2003 ) , and once an individual attends a session , it may be difficult to leave in the middle because of decorum or other pragmatic reasons . The link between in - person communication and improved engagement with ideas is further suggested by studies of schools ( Jack et al . , 2023 ) and universities , where students have described trouble concentrating when ideas are communicated online ( Kofoed et al . , 2021 ) . Second , academic presentations often provide opportunities for attendees to give feedback to the presenter ( Rose et al . , 2022 ) . The feedback may improve the ideas and make them more attractive for citing . This mechanism has been called maturation ( Leon & McQuillin , 2018 ) . In our setting , the maturation mechanism is ruled out because the conferences comprising the data were archival , i . e . not works - in - progress . We refer to an attendee’s citing of screened - in papers as “intentional diffusion” since the attendee expressed explicit intent to learn about them , and ask RQ1 : Do in - person presentations increase intentional diffusion ? For ideas that a conference attendee initially screens out or never gets to screen , presentations may act via the mechanisms described above and the additional mechanism of awareness . Studies of scientific knowledge flows find that due to the overabundance of papers , researchers are often not aware of even the relevant ones ( Azoulay et al . , 2019 ; D . R . Feenberg et al . , 2015 ) . In - person presentations may increase awareness through incidental exposure . Papers are often organized into sessions , and it can be difficult to leave a session immediately before or after seeing the presentation ( s ) of interest . Consequently , attendees’ attention to presentations of screened - in papers may spill over to other presentations in the same session . We refer to the citing of these other ideas as “serendipitous diffusion , ” since it does not fall into the intentional category , and ask : RQ2 : Do in - person presentations increase serendipitous diffusion ? A key question regarding serendipitous diffusion is its magnitude relative to intentional diffusion . Many of humanity’s most prominent discoveries – from Velcro to Viagra – can be attributed to serendipity ( Busch , 2020 ; Meyers , 2007 ) . The literature has also established that serendipity can be engineered top - down through policy or other exogenous events . For example , rearranging the locations of where individuals work ( Catalini , 2017 ; Lee , 2019 ) and access information ( Nahm et al . , 2023 ) , or assigning them at random to different conference rooms ( Lane et al . , 2021 ) , can all lead to diffusion and collaborations that would not have occurred otherwise . However , such exogenous changes are relatively rare . How much serendipity is there in the normal course of research ? Do the historical anecdotes and exogenous changes play a minor role in research relative to intentional diffusion and discoveries ? Besides the intellectual interest , the question of magnitude has policy implications . Different communication modalities afford different levels of serendipity : for instance , it may be easier to exit an online session of paper presentations without compromising decorum than an in - person one . If so , online sessions may generate less serendipitous diffusion and conference organizers need to consider whether this is an issue worth addressing . However , if serendipitous diffusion is minor even at in - person sessions , the implications for the organizers are also minor . Accordingly , we ask RQ3 : What fraction of total diffusion is serendipitous ? The effect of presentations on diffusion is likely to vary with the semantic distance between a paper’s ideas and a person’s research area . Previous work has found that the probability of citation between two papers is lower the more semantically distant they are ( Baldi , 1998 ; Wuestman et al . , 2019 ) . On the one hand , presentations may increase a researcher’s citing above this baseline particularly when a paper is distant , because she is less likely to encounter it outside of the conference . On the other hand , presentations may do little to increase the citing of distant papers for two reasons . First , presentations may increase awareness and engagement for these ideas but their utility , as measured by citations , may remain low . Second , our research design relies on variation in opportunities to see presentations , i . e . intent - to - treat effects of seeing presentations . Researchers may be less likely to take advantage of opportunities to see semantically distant presentations , i . e . comply less with the assignment to a high opportunity to see them . This topic also has policy implications . It is often claimed that the organization of researchers into groups with clear boundaries , such as university departments , has the effect of creating information silos that slow down innovation ( Jeppesen & Lakhani , 2010 ; Lifshitz - Assaf , 2018 ) . If so , it is appealing for policy - makers and administrators to stimulate diffusion by exogenously exposing researchers to ideas outside of their silo , which they often find particularly influential ( Duede et al . , 2024 ) . However , if presentations are ineffective at stimulating intentional or serendipitous diffusion of distant ideas , top - down efforts may prove equally ineffective . RQ4 : How do presentations’ effects on intentional and serendipitous diffusion vary across paper - person semantic distance ? Existing research that addresses these questions convincingly is very limited . To our knowledge , the study that comes closest is by de Leon and McQuillin ( 2018 ) , which estimates the causal effect of conferences on citations using the unexpected cancellation of a major political science conference . By comparing that year’s conference to prior instances , as well as to a smaller annual conference used as a control , the authors estimate that being presented at a conference increased a paper’s chances of being cited at least once within four years after the conference by five percentage points . However , the study left several questions unresolved . First , it could not identify which activities of the conference ( i . e . presentations , banquets ) caused the effects , since all activities were canceled . Second , the conferences were for works - in - progress , so many papers underwent substantial changes or were abandoned ; the authors were able to track the citations of only 27 % of the presented papers . Third , the setting is mechanically complicated by the possibility of maturation , i . e . feedback improving papers and citations . Lastly and perhaps most importantly , it is likely that attendees of those conferences did not have synchronous access to those ideas outside of the conferences . In contrast , our interest is in the effect of presentations in the increasingly common case where the same ideas are easily available online and as presentations . 3 . Data and Methods 3 . 1 . Confer Many conferences use scheduling software deployed via apps and websites to help attendees create their schedules . We use data from one such platform , Confer , which lets a user browse papers and Like those that are of interest , and displays a convenient , individualized schedule 0F 1 . Supplementary Information ( SI ) : 1 . Illustration of the software provides screenshots of the interface . Data from Confer comprise metadata on the presented papers , such as their titles and timeslots , the names and affiliations users used when registering , and users’ Liked papers . Confer was deployed at 25 prominent computer science conferences held between 2013 - 2020 , representing 9070 paper presentations and other events like banquets and tutorials . The raw data included 2 , 759 unique usernames and 105 , 442 Likes to paper presentations and other events like banquets and tutorials . We excluded from analysis Likes that were to users’ own papers , papers published before the conference ( i . e . “Test of Time” award sessions ) , and non - research - paper events . Non - research - paper events were identified using a variety of heuristics , such as keywords like “coffee” appearing in the session name or there being more than eight works scheduled for presentation . SI 3 . Full vs . analytic sample details how the 470 non - research - paper events were identified . After Likes to such events were excluded there remained 2 , 541 unique user names and 89 , 536 Likes . 3 . 1 . 1 . Measuring learning intentions with Likes Liking papers on Confer indicates which papers a user intends to learn about . For a particular user the non - Liked papers at a particular conference consist of ones screened - out and never screened . Some non - Liked papers will be presented in the same sessions as a user’s Liked papers ; the user is unlikely to learn these papers intentionally , but given the challenges of entering and leaving in - person sessions in the middle , may do so incidentally . We focus on these same - session papers to measure serendipitous diffusion , and for convenience refer to them as non - Liked papers , although technically they are only a subset of all non - Liked papers . Users may also be incidentally exposed to papers outside of sessions with Liked papers , although our research design gives us little leverage for such cases . We highlight that measuring the amount of serendipitous diffusion only through non - Liked papers in certain sessions is conservative , as 1 Confer has been recently discontinued . An archived version is available at https : / / web . archive . org / web / 20221222092038 / https : / / confer . csail . mit . edu / . Accessed 2023 - 12 - 29 . this represents only one type of incidental exposure . The number of non - Liked user - paper pairs in the analytic sample is 108 , 402 . The total number of user - paper pairs in the analytic sample was 192 , 128 . 3 . 2 . Bibliometric data and matching The Confer user and paper data was supplemented with bibliometric data from the databases OpenAlex ( Priem et al . , 2022 ) , SemanticScholar ( Kinney et al . , 2023 ) , and Crossref . These databases are among the most comprehensive and widely used for bibliometric analyses . 3 . 2 . 1 . Matching Confer users to OpenAlex records Matching was done in two steps . First , we searched for a user’s affiliation in OpenAlex to get its institution ID . We then performed an author search using the user’s user name , institution ID ( using the field last _ known _ institution ) , and the topic “Computer science” ( x _ concepts with ID C41008148 ) . If this search yielded matches , we took the first match as the correct one 1F 2 . If it yielded no matches , we repeated the search without using the institution constraint . This matching process failed to link seven users to OpenAlex author IDs . Author IDs with more than 500 papers were excluded because inspection revealed these to be disambiguation errors in OpenAlex . Inspection by one of the authors ( M . T ) of twenty randomly selected remaining user names showed that the matching was correct in 90 % of the cases . The three most common institutions of the users were University of Washington ( 86 ) , Microsoft ( 68 ) , and Carnegie Mellon University ( 68 ) . The mean number of papers up to 2024 per user was 86 . 5 ( SD = 95 . 2 , median = 51 ) . 3 . 2 . 2 . Matching Confer papers to DOIs and metadata Data from Confer included DOIs for 1591 papers . For the other papers and events ( e . g . tutorials ) , we used a three - step matching process . First , we searched each paper in SemanticScholar using the title ( with colons removed ) , the field ( fieldsOfStudy ) of “Computer Science , ” and the publication year equal to the year of the conference or the year prior . Second , if the search did not yield a result we repeated it after removing any part of the title after the colon . Third , for any remaining unmatched papers , we used the Crossref search API with a string consisting of “author names + paper title + conference year . ” We took the first result as the match . 9 , 664 papers were linked to DOIs in one of these ways , leaving 368 papers or events unmatched . To increase match quality , we used the DOI prefix ( the digits before the slash ) , which identifies the publishing organization , e . g . ACM . For each of the 25 conferences , we identified the most common prefix , 2 Results are ranked by a relevance score , which is described in the API documentation https : / / docs . openalex . org / how - to - use - the - api / get - lists - of - entities / search - entities , accessed 2023 - 12 - 28 . Relevance is calculated by text similarity and citations , with higher cited entities scoring higher . and excluded from the analytic sample DOIs with different prefixes . This exclusion reduced the number of included DOIs to 9231 , and manual inspection did not uncover any inaccurate matches . 3 . 3 . Semantic distance and shared affiliation Next , we obtained from SemanticScholar the papers’ Specter2 embeddings , which are 768 - dimensional vectors embedding the papers’ titles and abstracts and yielding state - of - the - art performance on domain - specific tasks , such as predicting citations ( Singh et al . , 2022 ) . We used these embeddings to calculate the semantic distance between a user’s research and the presented paper as follows . We identified all of the user’s papers published in the five years before the year of a particular paper’s presentation and measured the average cosine distance between each of the user’s papers and the presented paper . 13 . 1 % of user - paper pairs had missing semantic distance because either the user had no papers before the conference or the embedding was not available in SemanticScholar . Lastly , using OpenAlex we obtained the presented papers’ author IDs , affiliations , and metadata on the papers citing them ( up to 10 , 000 ) . Using these metadata we identified if and when a user cited a paper after its presentation , as well as whether she and the authors shared an affiliation at the time of analysis in 2023 . Data limitations prevented us from measuring shared affiliations dynamically . 3 . 4 . Research design 3 . 4 . 1 . Scheduling conflicts The research design uses scheduling conflicts in a user’s personal schedule for variation in her opportunities to see paper presentations . Our data did not include the exact scheduled time of each presentation but did have the session’s starting time and presentations’ order in the session . We assumed that presentations in sessions starting at the same time and with the same order were in the same ~ 15 - minute timeslot . Scheduling conflicts are defined at the user - paper level : for example , if a user Likes only one paper in a timeslot , that user - paper pair has scheduling conflict level 0 . If she likes two presentations in the same minute , both user - paper pairs have conflict level 1 . While defining scheduling conflicts for Liked papers is relatively straightforward , for serendipity papers it is less so . One reason is that users often Like multiple papers in a session , and each of them might have a different level of conflict . We take the average number of conflicts for all papers the user Liked in a session as the conflict level for the session’s serendipity papers . For example , consider a user who Liked two papers in a session with four papers , one that is co - scheduled with one in another session and one that is co - scheduled with three in other sessions . Then for this user the two non - Liked ( serendipity ) papers in the session would have scheduling conflicts of ( 1 + 3 ) / 2 = 2 . For ease of exposition , we bin that variable as follows : “0” = [ 0 , 1 ) , “1” = [ 1 , 2 ) , “2” = [ 2 , 3 ) , “3 + ” = [ 3 , infinity ) . 3 . 4 . 2 . Identification assumption Scheduling conflicts vary the level or “dose” of treatment 𝜏𝜏 – opportunity to see presentations – that user - paper pairs receive . ( This design can also be thought of as intention - to - treat , where the treatment is seeing presentations . ) If a user Likes only one paper in a timeslot , then she has a full opportunity , or dose of 𝜏𝜏 , to see it . If a user likes two papers in a timeslot , she can see only one of the presentations , so the average level of opportunity for these user - paper pairs is 𝜏𝜏 / 2 . Similarly , for a timeslot with n papers , the average opportunity to see them is 𝜏𝜏 / n . A key concern for a causal interpretation of our results is that conference schedules are not exogenous , and so any user’s scheduling conflicts may not be exogenous to their potential outcomes . To address the potential endogeneity we take two steps . First , we make only a conditional independence assumption , where we condition scheduling conflicts on paper and user fixed effects . Paper fixed effects control for potential underlying differences in papers’ qualities , scheduling positions , presenter characteristics , and any other stable differences . This enables us to use only the variation in citing a paper that occurs when one user has many scheduling conflicts in seeing it while another does not . For example , if papers with more famous authors are scheduled in more attractive timeslots and attract more citations , such patterns will not affect our estimated treatment effect . Furthermore , we use user fixed effects to control for the overall propensity to attend presentations , publish and cite papers , and any other stable differences . Second , we test for any possible remaining endogeneity in scheduling conflicts using two features of user - paper pairs that , based on prior work , we assume to strongly affect scheduling conflicts . These features are the semantic distance between a user’s body of work and the presented paper , and whether a user and the presented paper’s author ( s ) share an affiliation . In section 4 . 4 . we test whether controlling for them affects our estimated treatment effects . We also test the sensitivity of the results to excluding cases with zero scheduling conflicts , on the assumption that if individuals change their schedules to avoid conflicts with particularly important papers , they will reduce conflicts to 0 . We use a linear probability model with the following specification 𝑌𝑌 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = � 1 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 . 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑁𝑁𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 𝑠𝑠𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑐𝑐𝑠𝑠 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 1 � ⋅ 𝜏𝜏 + 𝑃𝑃 𝑖𝑖 + 𝑈𝑈 𝑖𝑖 + 𝜖𝜖 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ( 1 ) where 𝑌𝑌 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝐼𝐼�𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑛𝑛 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 1 � is an indicator for whether paper i was cited by user j within some time - frame , and 𝜏𝜏 measures the effect of scheduling conflicts , which we call the presentation effect . 𝑃𝑃 𝑖𝑖 is the paper fixed effect , and 𝑈𝑈 𝑖𝑖 is the fixed effect for user j , and 𝜖𝜖 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the error . We refer to the grand average of the fixed effects 𝑃𝑃 𝑖𝑖 + 𝑈𝑈 𝑖𝑖 as the baseline , capturing all the non - presentation pathways leading to citations , in particular online access . As the denominator ( 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 . 𝑠𝑠𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑁𝑁𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑠𝑠 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 1 ) goes to infinity , the user has no chance to see any of the presentations and the expression reduces to only the baseline and error . We also estimate logistic models for our main results to test for possible sensitivity to functional form . We emphasize that the baseline or “control” relative to which the presentation effect is measured is not a complete lack of access to the information , but access to the paper online or through other non - conference channels . This feature of the design mimics the realistic choice facing conference attendees : to attend a paper presentation in person and access it online for any additional details later or to only access it online later . 3 . 5 . Descriptive statistics The 25 computer science conferences comprising the Confer data varied substantially in topic and number of user - paper pairs . Figure 1 below displays the distribution of Liked and non - Liked user - paper pairs by conference acronym and conference year . Two prominent annual conferences comprise the majority of the data : the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems ( CHI ) and the ACM Conference On Computer - Supported Cooperative Work And Social Computing ( CSCW ) . Topics represented by the other conferences include databases and data management ( SIGMOD and VLDB ) , user interfaces ( UIST ) , and data mining ( KDD ) . Altogether the conferences represent a broad sample of computer science topics . Figure 1 . Distribution of Liked and non - Liked user - paper pairs by conference . Crucially , all these conferences were archival , meaning that paper presentations were of final papers and not works - in - progress . This feature of the data removes the possibility that diffusion was affected by mature maturation ( see Section 2 ) . The number of user - paper pairs contributed by each user was also uneven . Figure 2 displays the distribution of pairs across users . The maximum number of pairs for a user was 1420 , which is omitted from the figure for legibility . Figure 2 . Histogram of user - paper pairs contributed by each user . Figure 3 displays the distribution of scheduling conflicts . The modal user - paper pair for both Liked and non - Liked papers had no scheduling conflicts . In less than 1 % of cases , users had four or more scheduling conflicts in a timeslot . Figure 3 .

Descriptive statistics for serendipity papers . The correlation tables for Liked and non - Liked user - paper pairs are displayed in Figures S4 and S5 in the SI . 4 . Results 4 . 1 . The effect of presentations on citations Within two years of the conference , users cited 3 . 5 % of the papers they Liked and 0 . 8 % of the non - Liked papers . Figure 4 shows that in the raw data , i . e . without any regression adjustments , citation probabilities decreased with the level of scheduling conflicts . Figure 4 . Unadjusted ( raw data ) citation probabilities across user - paper pairs with different levels of scheduling conflicts for A : Liked user - paper pairs and B : non - Liked ones . Non - Liked scheduling conflicts are the mean of the Liked papers’ conflicts in that session . These differences in raw citation probabilities may reflect characteristics beyond just the number of scheduling conflicts . They could be confounded by differences among papers or users . For example , paper presentations with fewer scheduling conflicts might be of higher quality because conference organizers scheduled them in less busy timeslots in the overall schedules . Accordingly , we use fixed effects models with specification ( 1 ) and vary the citation time window from one to nine years after the conference . Estimated baseline and presentation effects are displayed in Figure 5 , while Table 3 is the regression table for Liked papers and Table 4 for non - Liked ones . The Tables highlight that the number of observations decreases with the length of the time window ; for example , only conferences in 2013 have accrued a nine - year citation time window . Figure 5 . Presentation and baseline effects from regressions of form ( 1 ) predicting citation 1 to 9 years after the conference . Presentation effects are the coefficients of the 1 / ( num . scheduling conflicts ) term and baseline effects are grand means of the fixed effects . A : Liked user - paper pairs and B : non - Liked ones . Error bars represent 95 % confidence intervals with standard errors clustered at the level of the fixed effects . Figure 5 Panel A shows that the estimated presentation effects are substantively and statistically significant for almost all years after the conference ; the statistically non - significant estimates are for the longest time windows , which have the fewest observations . For example , two years after a conference users cite 2 . 4 % of papers they Liked without seeing presentations ( baseline ) , and an extra 1 . 5 % if they could see them presented ( presentation effect ) , which represents a 62 . 5 % boost . For non - Liked papers , the analogous estimates are baseline = 0 . 4 % , and presentation effect = 0 . 5 % , which represents a 125 % boost . Such a large presentation effect supports the interpretation of non - Liked paper citations as serendipitous diffusion , as it was very unlikely to happen without presentations . We underscore that these effects appear despite attendees having access to all of these papers online . Furthermore , if treatment is defined as seeing rather than having opportunities to see presentations , then our presentation effects are intention - to - treat , and the treatment effects are likely larger . These results answer Research Questions 1 and 2 in the affirmative : in - person presentations increase intentional and serendipitous diffusion , and are especially important for the latter .

Fixed effects regression estimates predicting citation of non - Liked papers t years after the conference . The model number is t . Intercept is the grand mean of the fixed effects . Standard errors are clustered at the level of the fixed effects ( user , paper ) . 4 . 2 . Relative contributions of direct and serendipitous diffusion To compare the magnitude of intentional vs . serendipitous diffusion , we make the following back - of - the - envelope calculation . Focusing on 2 - year citations , we assume that the presentation effect for each Liked user - paper pair is 𝜏𝜏 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝐿𝐿𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 = 0 . 015 ( Table 3 , column 2 ) and for each non - Liked one is 𝜏𝜏 𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑒−𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝐿𝐿𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 = 0 . 005 ( Table 4 , column 2 ) . We then divide this effect by each user - paper pair’s actual number of scheduling conflicts . Summing across pairs separately for the two types of papers gives the expected amount of intentional and serendipitous diffusion . The sums are 𝑐𝑐𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑒𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑒 . 𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑁𝑁𝑠𝑠𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑛𝑛 = ∑ 𝜏𝜏 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 1 + 𝑒𝑒𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 . 𝑠𝑠𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑐𝑐𝑠𝑠 𝑖𝑖 𝑒𝑒𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 .

The relative contribution of serendipity is thus 410 . 3 934 . 9 + 410 . 3 = 30 . 5 % . We answer Research Question 3 by showing that , conservatively , about 30 % of diffusion created by ( opportunities to see ) presentations was serendipitous . 4 . 3 . Semantic distance Lastly , we explore how presentation effects vary across papers that are semantically close or distant to the user . To do so , we split the semantic distance variable into quartiles , and interact the treatment variable in specification ( 1 ) with the quartile indicators . The resulting estimates are visualized in Figure 6 and presented in Table 5 . Figure 6 .

Regression estimates predicting citation within two years of the conference as a function of semantic distance between the user’s work and the presented paper . Models ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are fixed effects models for Liked and non - Liked papers . Model ( 3 ) is an OLS model including a control for the mean semantic distance of Liked papers . Standard errors are clustered at the level of the fixed effects . The presentation effects decrease with semantic distance and are statistically insignificant at the 0 . 05 level for the farthest two quartiles . We answer Research Question 4 with the observation that presentations cause diffusion primarily of semantically proximate papers . There are two plausible interpretations of this pattern . First , presentations have little effect on absorbing semantically distant ideas . Second , users may have not attended distant presentations despite having the opportunities to do so and never got exposed to the ideas . To help adjudicate between these interpretations , we make the assumption that users’ choices of which sessions to attend were driven primarily by characteristics of the Liked papers , not the non - Liked ones . In particular , we assume users were likelier to attend sessions with semantically close Liked papers than distant ones . Conditional on this distance to Liked papers , sometimes the non - Liked papers in those sessions were distant and sometimes close , resulting in variation in semantic distance that was plausibly unrelated to attendance . Following these assumptions , we estimate citation rates to non - Liked papers after adding a control for the mean semantic distance of Liked papers in those sessions . The distance for non - Liked papers is highly correlated with the mean distance for Liked papers ( 𝜌𝜌 = 0 . 79 , p < 0 . 001 ) , leading to inflated standard errors in the fixed effects models 2F 3 . Accordingly , we estimate the model without fixed effects and show the estimates in Table 5 , Model 3 . Results show that citation rates are much lower for semantically distant non - Liked papers even after controlling for Liked paper distance , suggesting that these ideas are harder to absorb . 4 . 4 . Testing the identification assumption and functional form We interpret the presentation effect 𝜏𝜏 in ( 1 ) as causal because we assume scheduling conflicts are exogenous conditional on the fixed effects . How credible is this assumption ? We consider two potential sources of endogeneity and test for them with alternative model specifications . First , users might curate their schedules to avoid scheduling conflicts for presentations they are most interested in seeing . Given the extensive evidence that semantic and institutional proximity predict diffusion ( Azoulay et al . , 2011 ; Belenzon & Schankerman , 2013 ; Catalini , 2017 ; M . T . Hansen , 1999 ; Head et al . , 2019 ; van der Wouden & Youn , 2023 ; Wuestman et al . , 2019 ) , we assume that two key proxies of interest are semantic proximity and if the presenter is from the same institution as the user . If accounting for these two proxies does not meaningfully change the results , then it is unlikely that other confounders will do so either . We estimated models of form ( 1 ) for two - year citations with and without controls for semantic distance and shared institution and display the results in Table S2 in the SI . Strikingly , adding the controls did not change the estimated presentation effect for either Liked ( models 1 and 2 ) or non - Liked papers ( models 4 and 5 ) . 3 These estimates are available upon request . Second , consider how a user might curate their schedule , if they wish to do so 3F 4 . If after Liking papers and generating her schedule the user discovers that a presentation of particular interest is conflicting with others , she is likely to delete all the others from the schedule , i . e . ensure there are zero scheduling conflicts . In contrast , timeslots with one or more conflicts are unlikely to have been curated in this way . Accordingly , we estimated models after excluding all user - paper pairs with zero scheduling conflicts and display the results in Table S2 , models 3 and 6 . The exclusion drops by about half the number of observations , and greatly increases estimated presentation effects ( 1 . 5 % → 4 . 3 % for Liked papers and 0 . 5 % → 1 . 8 % for non - Liked ) . A possible explanation for the much larger estimates in the subset is that younger scholars Like more papers , more often have > 1 conflict , are overrepresented in the subset , and are more affected by presentations . Overall , both tests provide support for the identification assumption that scheduling conflicts are conditionally exogenous . The analyses throughout the paper relied on linear probability models for interpretive ease , despite the outcomes being binary . To test for the sensitivity of the results to functional form we estimated logistic models predicting citation within two years of the conference . Coefficients and average marginal effects from these models are displayed in Tables S3 and S4 , respectively . Many user - and paper - groups had no variation in the outcome variable and were dropped during estimation , resulting in much smaller sample sizes . The coefficient of the presentation effect was positive and statistically significant in all models , matching our preferred specifications . The average marginal presentation effects were generally much larger than in the linear probability models , likely due to the more selected samples used in estimation . We conclude that the results from the linear probability models are consistent with and possibly more conservative than those from logistic models . 5 . Discussion This study explored the role in diffusion of seeing ideas presented in person when the same ideas are easily accessible online . The information environment where individuals can access the same ideas through different modalities is an increasingly common but rarely studied one , and it is not a priori clear how much value short in - person presentations add to online access , if any . We posed four research questions about presentations and developed answers by combining fine - grained data from Confer , a platform researchers use to create personalized schedules at academic conferences , and researchers’ subsequent citing decisions . The identification strategy used scheduling conflicts , which we argued are plausibly exogenous after conditioning on user and paper fixed effects . Scheduling conflicts create variation in whether an individual can see a paper presented in - person without changing other determinants of diffusion , such as underlying knowledge or interest . In this 4 We thank Nicholas Bloom for this idea . research design the treatment is opportunities to see presentations , and we called the associated causal effects “presentation effects . ” We note that another interpretation of these effects is as intent - to - treat , where the treatment is seeing presentations . Further , we utilized the fact that in Confer users can browse all papers and Like only those they want added to their schedules . Liking provides an explicit measure of intention to learn , enabling us to distinguish between intentional ( Liked ) and serendipitous diffusion ( non - Liked papers ) . Research Questions 1 and 2 ask whether in - person presentations increase intentional and serendipitous diffusion . Focusing on citations within two years after the conference , the presentation effects increased intentional diffusion by 62 . 5 % ( 2 . 4 % → 3 . 9 % ) and serendipitous diffusion by 125 % ( 0 . 4 % → 0 . 9 % ) . Presentat ions were thus quite effective at stimulating diffusion of both types . Mechanistically , presentations could have stimulated the diffusion of Liked papers by improving engagement and non - Liked papers by improving awareness and engagement . Because the presentation effect was , in relative terms , much larger for non - Liked papers , presentations likely increased awareness of unsought ideas . That so many evidently useful non - Liked papers would not have been cited without presentations also supports our interpretation of this diffusion as serendipitous . Research Question 3 concerns the contribution of serendipity to diffusion . A back - of - the - envelope calculation showed that even using our narrow definition of serendipitous diffusion as that of non - Liked papers , that contribution was 30 . 5 % of the total diffusion caused by presentations two years post - conference . To our knowledge , this is the first such quantification and it reveals serendipity plays a very substantial role at in - person conferences . Lastly , Research Question 4 concerns the role of semantic distance in diffusion . We found that presentation effects were precipitously lower for papers that were semantically distant from the researchers and were statistically non - significant at the farthest levels . This pattern leads to two implications . First , it corroborates previous work showing inefficiencies in scientific communication ( D . R . Feenberg et al . , 2015 ) . If communication was very efficient , researchers would readily utilize ideas that are useful and can be found and absorbed at low cost , and semantically proximate ideas should be relatively easy to find and absorb . Yet even ~ 15 - minute presentations greatly increase the utilization of proximate ideas . Second , previous work has found that researchers identify semantically distant ideas as particularly influential for their work ( Duede et al . , 2024 ) , raising the question of whether such diffusion can be stimulated exogenously , for example via events designed to promote interdisciplinarity ( Lane et al . , 2021 ) . Our results suggest that the effectiveness of such efforts is likely to be very limited . This study has several limitations , which offer fruitful avenues for future work . First , we use observational data and rely on the identification assumption that scheduling conflicts are conditionally independent of potential outcomes ; experimental and quasi - experimental research designs would help establish causality more conclusively . Second , our data do not measure actual presentation attendance , resulting in intent - to - treat effects of presentations . Intent - to - treat effects are particularly useful for policy - makers and administrators who may be interested in encouraging researchers to see ideas that are interdisciplinary or of other types but cannot force them to do so . The effects of actual attendance can be expected to be even larger than our intent - to - treat estimates . Third , we analyzed conferences only in the field of computer science . The role of presentations in other fields is less clear and deserves investigation . On the one hand , presentations in fields where conferences are non - archival may be even more important as they may enable attendees to provide feedback , adding a “reverse” direction of knowledge flow ( Leon and McQuillin 2018 ) . On the other hand , attendees may invest less effort into attending presentations of works - in - progress . Lastly , our sample of conferences was in - person , and enabled measuring the added value of presentations when ideas are easily available online . However , it is also important to compare different communication and conferencing modalities directly , which we hope future work will do . 6 . Conclusion Knowledge flows between innovators shape the ideas they draw on and affect the rate and direction of their efforts . Two aspects of knowledge flows - geographic proximity and serendipity - continue to be a major focus and debate in the literature . A central challenge of previous work has been to access the micro - level of these flows , how individuals encounter , and learn and utilize specific ideas . Another challenge is establishing causality , since individuals do not invest attention into ideas at random . Lastly , most existing studies do not address changes to the information environment : ideas are increasingly accessible online , so individuals often decide not whether to access ideas or not but whether to access them in ways additional to online . This paper partially overcomes these challenges by using fine - grained measures of idea diffusion in the setting of academic conferences . We found that in - person presentations increased the diffusion of papers of interest and unsought ones by very large margins despite all the papers being easily available online . Placing these findings within the literature on geographical proximity and innovation leads to three implications . First , the findings suggest that in - person communication does offer advantages that are not completely substitutable by online access to the same information . Those advantages likely lie in increasing awareness of semantically related ideas , as well as engagement with their details . It is important to note the timeframe of our evidence – conferences held between 2013 and 2020 . Some recent scholarship has argued that progress in the technologies enabling remote collaboration has materially changed the role of geography in innovation . For example , Presidente and Frey found that research by teams collaborating remotely was less likely to lead to breakthroughs before 2010 , after which the pattern reversed ( Presidente & Frey , 2022 ) . Relatedly , Head and co - authors find that in mathematics geographical proximity does not predict citations , once interpersonal ties are controlled for , after 2004 . It is tempting to hypothesize from such studies that geographical proximity plays little role in diffusion in recent years . Our findings caution against such a sweeping conclusion , as even in recent years seeing ideas presented in - person was important for diffusion . Second , the effects of proximity are unlikely to be entirely mediated by collaboration ties and the geographic distribution of ideas , which are also geographically concentrated ( Head et al . , 2019 ; Wuestman et al . , 2019 ) . Third , it is important to note that the large presentation effects occurred through co - location that was very temporary ( ~ 15 - minute presentations ) , suggesting as a few others have done that long - term co - location may not be needed to achieve much of its communication benefits ( Chai & Freeman , 2019 ; Lane et al . , 2021 ; Torre , 2008 ) . We found that about 30 % of the diffusion generated by presentations was of ideas that researchers were very unlikely to learn about outside of the conference . If we interpret researchers’ screening of papers into their schedules as predictions about which ones are worth investing attention into , the substantial amount of serendipity suggests that the predictions are often wrong , and presentations help correct some of these mistakes . An important question for future research is whether other communication methods , such as online conferences , achieve similar effectiveness in stimulating serendipitous diffusion . The effectiveness of presentations also provides some support for centering conferences around them , instead of other activities , such as informal networking . The diffusion of ideas through formal presentations is also likely to be more inclusive than if informal activities , which are likely to be less inclusive ( Forrester 2021 ) , are made central . Lastly , the paper contributes to the toolkit of social scientists an attractive identification strategy based on scheduling conflicts . Scheduling conflicts are ubiquitous in the daily lives of individuals and affect which ideas and people they encounter , helping estimate the effect of the latter on important outcomes like diffusion and collaboration .

Confer’s “My Schedule” interface . 2 . Full vs . analytic sample The raw data contained many observations with missing values of critical covariates , particularly presentation type and the timeslots of presentations . Additionally , the conferences contained a number of sessions that are of a social or celebratory nature , such as banquets , keynotes or poster sessions . Consequently , several exclusion criteria were applied to the full sample to reduce it to the “analytic sample” used in the analyses . Of the 3 , 061 sessions across all the conferences 2 , 177 had a valid “type” . Of the ones with a valid type 1 , 150 are classified as “paper” , “workshop” or “journal” . We sought to exclude the types representing non - research sessions . The excluded types are shown in Table S1 , comprising types such as “lunch” , “coffee” , and “tutorial . ” Excluded sessions were not used to track citations but may nevertheless contribute to scheduling conflicts , i . e . an attendee might have a conflict between a research paper session and a banquet . We include these non - research sessions when measuring scheduling conflicts . As a robustness check , we also measure conflicts excluding these sessions , and find that the two measures correlated at 0 . 994 . Consequently , we rely on the former measure in the rest of the analyses . Keyword Number of sessions tutorial 65 course 60 coffee 56 student 42 lunch 41 keynote 38 poster 38 panel 33 award 31 demo 31 reception 28 registration 12 lasting impact 7 banquet 5 steering committee 3 townhall 3 uist closing 2 < = 1 or > = 9 or more presentations in the session ( and not one of the keywords above ) 12 Total 470 Table S1 . The first column contains keywords from titles of sessions that we assumed to indicate a non - research session . The second column shows how many session titles included that keyword and were excluded from the analytic sample . Second , we excluded from the analytic sample user - paper pairs where the user had cited the paper before the conference . Such cases occurred in “Lasting Impact” sessions , where the papers presented had been published many years prior to the conference , or the paper was matched to an Arxiv preprint . There were 68 such cases . Other steps in the construction of the analytic sample are described in the main manuscript . 3 . Supplementary tables Table S2 .
