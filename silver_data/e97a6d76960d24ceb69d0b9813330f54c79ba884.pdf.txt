When compared to broad traits , the model suggests that situation - specific traits exert a more pervasive influence on IT situation - specific individual dif - ferences .

From a theoretical perspective , the findings help to further our understanding of the nomological network among individual differences that lead to computer self - efficacy . From a practical perspective , the findings may help IT managers design training programs that more effectiveiy increase the com - puter self - efficacy of users with different disposi - tional characteristics .

Individual differences refer to factors M / S Quarterly Vol . 26 No . 4 . pp . 381 - 396 / December 2002 381 Thatcher & Perrewe / Computer Anxiety & Computer Self - Efficacy suctn as personaiity , situationai , and demographic variabies that influence user ' s beiiefs about and use of information technoiogy ( Agarwai and Prasad 1999 ) . Researchers have found that stabie situation - specific individuai differences such as personai innovativeness in iT ( Agarwai and Prasad 1998b ) or computer piayfuiness ( Webster and Martocchio 1992 ) as weil as dynamic , situation - specific individuai differences such as computer self - efficacy ( Compeau and iHiggins 1995a ) and computer anxiety ( iHarrison and Rainer 1992 ) influence how individuais perceive and use information technoiogy . Aithougin mounting evidence suggests individual differences infiuence IT use , more integrative research is needed to better understand the nomologicai net among individuai differences that reiate to IT acceptance and use ( Marai ^ as et ai . 2000 ; Weii and Wugaiter 1990 ) . Theory suggests that broad stabie traits such as neuroticism ( Watson and Ciark 1984 ) and situation - specific , stabie traits such as innovativeness ( Goidsmith and Hofai < er 1991 ) infiuence dynamic individuai differences such as situation - specific efficacy or anxiety that lead to individuals ' beiiefs and behavior ( Kanfer and Heggested 1997 ) . Given that dynamic individual differences have been directly United with behaviors , perhaps under - standing the fundamental underpinnings of how dynamic individuai differences can arise vwoutd be of vaiue for deveioping iT training programs more effectiveiy . Hence , we examine the reiationships among broad and stable , situation - specific indivi - duai traits on dynamic , situation - specific individual differences . Specificaliy , this study examines the pattern of reiationships among dynamic , iT - specific indivi - dual differences ( i . e . , computer anxiety and computer seif - efficacy ) and stable individuai dif - ferences ( i . e . , personal innovativeness , negative affectivity , and trait anxiety ) . The paper begins by examining the reiationship between computer self - efficacy ( CSE ) and computer anxiety ( CA ) . Next , we lini < individual differences to CSE and CA . Then , we empiricaliy examine the hypothesized reiationships . The paper conciudes with a discussion of results , limitations , and implications for practice . We extend our understanding of how stabie individual differences ( both broad and situation - specific ) affect CA and CSE . Theoretical Model The theoretical modei underpinning this study is presented in Figure 1 . The model suggests that dynamic , IT - specific individual differences ( i . e . , computer seif - efficacy and computer anxiety ) are a function of stabie situation - specific ( i . e . , per - sonal innovativeness in IT ) and broad ( i . e . , nega - tive affectivity and trait anxiety ) traits . Tabie 1 presents definitions of constructs used in this study . The foliowing sections elaborate on the constructs in the modei and the proposed relationships among them . Dynamic Individual Differences Dynamic , situation - specific individuai differences refiect maiieable dispositions that affect re - sponses to stimuli within a specific situation . Dynamic individuai differences differ from stabie traits in that training , incentives , or other environ - mental factors may diminish or increase their infiuence on behavior over time ( Ghiseili et ai . 1981 ) . Within innovation diffusion research , CSE and CA are well - established dynamic , situation - specific individual differences . Computer Self - Efficacy Computer self - efficacy ( CSE ) refers to individuals ' judgment of their capabiiities to use computers in diverse situations ( Compeau and iHiggins 1995b ; Marai ^ as et ai . 1998 ) . Research suggests that individuais who possess high CSE are more likely to form positive perceptions of IT ( Venkatesh and Davis 1996 ) , and , more frequently , use of IT ( Compeau et al . 1999 ) . In a review ofthe iitera - ture , Marakas et ai . ( 1998 ) identified numerous behavioral , cognitive , and environmentai influ - ences on CSE . They suggest that computer anxiety is an important correiate of CSE . 382 MIS Quarterly Voi 26 No . 4 / December 2002 Thatcher & Perrewe / Computer Anxiety & Computer Self - Efficacy NegativeAffect H3 : Personal Innovativenessin IT H2b : - Computer â€¢ ' Self - Efficacy , H5 : Mediation Figure 1 .

MIS Quarterly Vol . 26 No . 4 / December 2002 383 Thatcher & Perrewe / Computer Anxiety & Computer Self - Efficacy Computer Anxiety Computer anxiety ( CA ) refers to fears about the implications of computer use such as the loss of important data or fear of other possible mistakes ( Sievert et al . 1988 ) and , as such , it is the product of combinations of psychological variables such as neuroticism and locus of control ( Marakas et al . 2000 ) , Theory and research suggests that an individual ' s computer anxiety is dynamic in that it may be influenced by dispositional and environ - mental factors ( Marakas et al , 2000 ) , Individuals who have more confidence in their capabilities tend to demonstrate lower levels of CA , Studies ( for example , Kinzie et al . 1994 ) have demon - strated that CA has a strong relationship with CSE and technology use . Results suggest that as anxiety grows , individuals demonstrate lower levels of CSE and a weaker proclivity to use computers . The Relationship between Computer Anxiety and Computer Self - Efficacy Social learning theory ( SLT ) suggests that self - efficacy and anxiety influence each other ( Bandura 1977 , 1997 ) , SLT suggests that as individuals experience higher anxiety , they may report lower levels of efficacy : however , as their efficacy levels rise , individuals report a corre - sponding decrease in anxiety ( Bandura 1997 ) . Even though the relationship is reciprocal , SLT research has found that efficacy beliefs are the primary influence on how individuals make decisions about their ability to perform tasks or interpretations of experiences ( Bandura 1997 , p . 137 ) , Forexample , Zimmerman ( 1995 ) found that academic self - efficacy mediated the relationship between math anxiety and classroom perfor - mance . Consistent with SLT , management infor - mation systems research has modeled computer self - efficacy and computer anxiety as having a reciprocal relationship ( Marakas et al , 1998 ) . Although we acknowledge the reciprocal relation - ship , we agree with Bandura ( 1997 ) that efficacy beliefs are the primary influence on behaviors and that it makes sense to model computer anxiety as an antecedent to computer self - efficacy . Because stable traits have been found to affect CA and CSE ( e . g . , Harris 1999 ; Watson and Clark 1984 ) , we believe it is important to model how CA may mediate the relationship from stable ( both situation - specific and broad ) traits to CSE , Hypothesis 1 : Computer anxiety will have a negative relationship with com - puter self - efficacy . Stable Individual Differences Theory suggests that stable , situation - specific and broad traits may demonstrate distinct relationships with dynamic individual differences , such as CSE and CA . Stable , situation - specific traits predispose individuals to respond consistently , but within a fairly narrow context or toward specific targets ( e , g . , using new technology ) . When compared to situation - specific traits , broadly conceptualized traits may exert a less pervasive influence on dynamic individual dif - ferences ( Day and Silverman 1989 ) , Because broad traits lack specific targets , Bandura ( 1997 ) argues that they may not shed light on the development of efficacy within specific domains . However , within the organizational stress litera - ture , research suggests that broad affective dispositions , such as negative affectivity and trait anxiety , are predictors of situation - specific anxiety ( Watson and Clark 1984 ; Watson et al , 1989 ) , Due to their consistent influence , stress re - searchers have recommended including broad traits in studies that examine stress and stress - linked outcomes such as anxiety . In light of these divergent opinions , it is important to consider the influence of both situation - specific traits ( i . e . , personal innovativeness in IT ) as well as broad traits ( i . e . , trait anxiety and negative affectivity ) on dynamic IT - specific individual differences ( i . e . , CA and CSE ) . Personal Innovativeness in iT Personal Innovativeness refers to individuals ' willingness to change ( Hurt et al . 1977 ) , and it is 384 MIS Quarterly Vol . 26 No . 4 / December 2002 Thatcher & Perrewe / Computer Anxiety & Computer Self - Efficacy believed to be a function of individuals ' tolerance of risk ( Bommer and Jalajas 1999 ) . If individuals are more willing to take risks , they are more likely to engage in innovative behavior ( Agarwal and Prasad 1998a ) . Personal innovativeness in infor - mation technology ( PUT ) is " the willingness of an individual to try out any new information tech - nology " ( Agarwal and Prasad 1998b , p , 206 ) . Consistent with recent research , PUT is con - ceptualized as a situation - specific , stable trait ( i . e . , it is expected to have a stable influence across situations involving information technology ) . Because traits shape individuals ' perceptions of their capabilities ( Lord et al . 1986 ) , the present study examines PIIT ' s role as an antecedent to computer self - efficacy and computer anxiety . Research suggests that highly innovative indivi - duals more frequently seek out new , mentally , or sensually stimulating experiences ( Uray and Ayla 1997 ; Venkatramen 1991 ) . in general , innovative individuals tend to demonstrate higher levels of self - confidence about perfornning new tasks or when entering new situations ( Kegerreis et al . 1970 ) . In the context of IT , this suggests that individuals who are high in PUT are more likely to seek out " stimulating experiences , " and demon - strate more confidence in their capacity to use a new technology ( Agarwal et al . 2000 ) . Alternately , individuals who report lower levels of PUT should have less tolerance for risk , and be more likely to report general computer anxiety ( Harris 1999 ) . Hence , Hypothesis 2a : Personal innovative - ness in information technology will have a positive relationship with computer self - efficacy . Hypothesis 2b : Personal innovative - ness in information technology will have a negative relationship with computer anxiety . Negative Affectivity and Trait Anxiety Neuroticism may influence individuals ' disposi - tions to respond to information technology ( Marakas et al . 2000 ) . Negative affectivity ( NA ) and trait anxiety ( TA ) measure different aspects of neuroticism ( Watson and Clark 1984 ) . NA is a broad stable trait that influences emotions and behavior ( Hochwarter et ai . 1998 ; Watson et al . 1984 ) . High NA individuals more frequently report anger , " distress , discomfort , and dissatisfaction overtime and regardless of the situation , even in the absence of any overt or objective source of stress " ( Watson and Clark 1984 , p . 483 ) . Evi - dence suggests that high NA individuals react more strongly to negative environmental stimuli than their low NA peers ( Fiske and Taylor 1991 ) . When thinking about different situations , high NA individuals are more likely to dwell on mistakes or inadequacies than their low NA peers . When extended to the domain of information technology , these findings suggest that NA should demon - strate a direct positive association with computer anxiety . Hence , Hypothesis 3 : Negative affectivity will have a positive relationship with com - puter anxiety . TA refers to a general tendency to experience anxiety when confronted with problems or chal - lenges ( Spielberger et al . 1970 ) . TA is relatively enduring such that individuals are more likely to experience anxiety overtime and across situations ( Tellegen 1985 ) . Although an aspect of neuroti - cism , high TA individuals may not be predisposed to experience emotions associated with NA such as anger , sadness , or a sense of rejection ( Spector et al . 2000 ; Watson sand Clark 1984 ) . Thus , although correlated , NA and TA remain conceptually distinct constructs . Anxiety about using computers is considered to be a form of a domain - specific trait anxiety . Thus , it is expected that TA will demonstrate a direct , positive asso - ciation with CA , Hence , Hypothesis 4 : Trait anxiety will have a positive relationship with computer anxiety . The theoretical model ( see Figure 1 ) identifies the proposed links among broad and situation - specific personality traits , computer anxiety , and computer MIS Quarterly Vol . 26 No . 4 / December 2002 385 Thatcher & Perrewe / Computer Anxiety & Computer Self - Efficacy self - efficacy . PUT , NA , and TA are proposed to have direct effects on computer anxiety . Because it is situation - specific , PUT is also proposed to have a direct effect on computer self - efficacy . Computer anxiety has a direct negative effect on individuals ' computer self - efficacy ( Weil and Wugalter 1990 ) and is proposed to serve as a mediator between stable traits and computer self - efficacy . Hypothesis 5 : Computer anxiety will mediate the relationships between the stable traits of personal innovativeness , negative affectivity , and trait anxiety and computer self - efficacy . Method Sample The sample consisted of students at a large public university in the Southeastern United States . Respondents completed self - reported ques - tionnaires the first week of spring semester during regularly scheduled class times . As an incentive , respondents received extra credit in a required introductory computing course , A total of 280 sur - veys were distributed and a total of 235 responses ( 83 % ) were received . Due to missing data , 211 responses ( 75 % ) were used in this analysis . The sample consisted of 120 males , 179 respondents who own a computer , an average age of 24 years old ( std . dev = 3 . 45 ) , 3 years of college ( std . dev . = . 94 ) , 2 . 5 computer courses ( std . dev . - 2 . 05 ) , and 7 . 16 years of computer experience ( std . dev . = 3 , 74 ) , Measures Computer self - efficacy was measured using 10 items developed by Compeau and Higgins ( 1995b ) , and computer anxiety was measured using four items drawn from the Computer Anxiety Rating Scale ( Heinssen et al , 1987 ) , Regarding the individual trait measures , trait anxiety was measured using four items from Lehrer and Woolfolk ( 1982 ) , negative affectivity was mea - sured using 10 items from the positive and negative affect scale ( PANAS ) ( Watson et al . 1988 ) , and personal innovativeness in IT was measured using four items developed byAganwal and Prasad ( 1998a , 1998b ) , Construct means and standard deviations may be found in Table 2 . A more detailed description of the measures can be found in Appendix A . Data Analysis To test the model , we used partial least squares ( PLS ) , a structural equation modeling ( SEM ) technique . PLS allows researchers to integrate measurement and structural models ( Bollen 1989 ) , The measurement model examines hypo - thesized links between indicators and latent constructs , whereas the structural model esti - mates hypothesized paths between exogenous ( independent ) and endogenous ( dependent ) latent constructs . ^ Results Measurement Model To assess reliability and validity using PLS , researchers typically calculate a block of indi - cators ' composite reliabilities , average variance extracted ( AVE ) ( Barclay et al . 1995 ; Chin 1998 ) . Interpreted like a Cronbach ' s alpha internal consistency reliability estimate , a composite reliability of . 70 or greater is considered accep - table for research ( Fornell and Larcker 1981 ) . The AVE measures the variance captured by the indictors relative to measurement error ( Fornell and Larcker 1981 ) , and it should be greater than The modei was estimated using PLS Graph Version 2 . 91 , 03 , 04 { Chin and Frye 1996 ) , Each construct was modeled as reflective . To test the statistical significance of the path coefficients , a bootstrapping procedure was used to generate 100 samples of 211 cases . Then , a T - test was conducted ( d , f , = 99 ) between the full sample and the mean of subsamples to test for significance . 386 MIS Quarterly Vol . 26 No . 4 / December 2002 Thatcher & Perrewe / Computer Anxiety & Computer Self - Efficacy Table 2 .

For adequate discriminant validity , diagonal elements should be greater than corresponding off - diagonal elements . , 50 to justify using a construct ( Barclay et al , 1995 ) , Results indicate adequate composite reliabilities and AVEs ( see Table 2 ) , To evaluate discrirrrinant and convergent validity , we examined the correlation of constructs and factor loadings . When the square root of each construct ' s AVE is greater than the correlation of the construct to other latent variables , the correla - tion of constructs demonstrates discriminant validity . A second way to evaluate discriminant validity is to examine each indicator ' s factor loadings ( Chin 1998 ) . Indicators should load higher on the construct of interest than on any other variable . Due to low factor loadings for two items , NA was reduced to an eight - item scale . The revised model ' s correlations of constructs ( see Table 2 ) and factor loadings ( see Table 3 ) demon - strate adequate discriminant and convergent validity . Structural Model A bootstrapping procedure was used to generate t - statistics and standard errors ( Chin 1998 ) . Interpreted like multiple regression , the R ^ indi - cates the amount of variance explained by the model ( Barclay et al . 1995 ) , To evaluate the full model . R ^ values were calculated for computer anxiety and computer self - efficacy . Structural model results are presented in Figure 2 . CA demonstrated a direct , statistically significant , negative relationship with CSE ( H1 p < . 01 ) , Individuals who experienced more CA were less likely to report high levels of CSE , thus supporting Hypothesis 1 , PI IT demonstrated a direct , statistically significant , positive relationship with CSE ( H2a p < , 01 ) , Individuals who reported higher levels of PI IT were more likely to report high levels of CSE , Additionally , PUT had a direct negative rela - tionship with CA ( H2b p < , 01 ) . These results support Hypotheses 2a and 2b . NA did not demonstrate a direct , statistically significant relationship with CA , thus Hypothesis 3 was not supported . In this sample , individuals with high NA were no more likely to experience CA than were their peers , TA demonstrated a direct statistically significant relationship to computer anxiety ( H4 p < , 025 ) , supporting Hypothesis 4 . Due to findings for NA and TA , we conducted supplemental analyses . Because they are concep - tually related , we examined the correlation between NA and TA and found them to be corre - lated at , 61 , High correlations between constructs may result in collinearity that magnify or obscure relationships between constructs . To formally test for collinearity ' s presence , we calculated the variable inflation factor ( VIF ) for constructs in the model .

Because the VIF ' s did not exceed 1 . 7 , our analysis indicates collinearity did not influence results . As a further test , we estimated a separate model that tested the affect of NA on CA in the absence of TA . Results suggest that NA did not directly effect CA ( p = n , s . ) . Despite its high correlation with NA , results suggest that TA has a distinct negative effect on CA , Finally , we found partial support for our mediation hypothesis ( H5 ) . We tested for mediation in three steps ( Baron and Kenny 1986 ) , First , we sepa - rately tested the direct effects of CA , PUT , TA and NA on CSE . Although TA ( p = n . s . ) and NA ( p ^ ns . ) were not significant correlates of CSE , CA ( p < , 01 ) and PUT ( p < , 01 ) demonstrated direct relationships to CSE . Then , we simultaneously tested paths from CA , PUT , TA , and NA to CSE . CA ( p < , 01 ) and PUT ( p < . 01 ) remained signi - ficant correlates of CSE . Finally , we added paths from TA , NA , and PUT to CA . PUT demonstrated a significant relationship to CA ( p < . 01 ) and CSE ( p < . 01 ) , TA ' s relationship to CA was significant ( p < . 05 ) , but it did not demonstrate a significant relationship to CSE ( p = n . s , ) . Hence , support was not found for direct effects of broad , stable traits on CSE , However , our results suggest that CA partially mediates the relationship from PUT ( a situation - specific , stable trait ) to CSE . Because efficacy beliefs have been concep - tualized as having a reciprocal relationship with anxiety , we conducted supplemental analyses testing the relationship from PUT , NA , and TA to CA that controlled for CSE ' s influence . Even though CSE ( p < , 01 ) was a significant correlate , results support the notion that PUT ( p < . 01 ) and TA ( p < . 05 ) demonstrate direct effects on CA . Controlling for CSE explained an additional . 06 of the variance in CA . Limitations Before discussing the results and the implications of this study , it is important to consider the study ' s limitations . The primary limitation relates to exter - nal validity . Sampling was limited to voluntary respondents enrolled in classes in a business MIS Quarterly Vol . 26 No . 4 / December 2002 389 Thatcher & Perrewe / Computer Anxiety & Computer Seif - Efficacy schooi of a large Southeastern university . There - fore , the resuits might have iimited generalizability to the individuais outside ofthe sample population in the nonacademic world . Further research is needed to assess the extent to which this study ' s resuits are appiicabie in diverse organizationai and task settings . Another limitation of this study concerns internal validity . Measures were gathered through self - reports at a single point in time . Seif - report measures may suffer from common method variance that could inflate observed relationships between constructs . However , James etal . ( 1979 ) suggested that common method variance is a concern when there appears to be a systematic infiation in the correlation of constructs matrix . Examination ofthe matrix in Tabie 2 demonstrates that correiations were varied across constructs at relativeiy iow ieveis . Aithough negative affectivity and trait anxiety were correiated at . 61 , forma ! tests for coilinearity suggested the correlation did not significantiy infiuence results . Thus , common method variance does not appear to be a signi - ficant flaw in this study . it is also important to note that respondents had not yet actually interacted with the technology required by their course . We do not know what effect participation in the training course wiii have on computer seif - efficacy or anxiety . Prior research suggests that a " treatment " or training wiii directly influence individuals ' beiiefs about their specific capabiiities ( Aganwai et al . 2000 ) . Future research should extend this study longi - tudinaity to evaluate the infiuence of broad and situation - specific traits on links between computer seif - efficacy and anxiety over time . Discussion Overaii , our findings provide insight into the nomoiogicai net among dynamic Individuai dif - ferences , situation - specific stabie traits , and broad stabie traits that reiate to IT acceptance and use . With the exception of NA , analysis supported mostofthe hypothesized relationships and resuits compiement prior research on computer anxiety and computer seif - efficacy . Where many studies focus on sociai explanations for efficacy { Com - peau and Higgins 1995a ; Martocchio 1992 ) , this study extends prior research by demonstrating how stable traits relate directiy to computer self - efficacy or indirectly through computer anxiety . Not surprisingly , our findings suggest situation - specific , stable traits influence iT - specific dynamic individuai differences . Consistent with Agarwal et ai . ( 2000 ) , this study found PUT to be a positive correlate with CSE . This study extends PiiT ' s nomoiogicai net by demonstrating it has a negative relationship with CA . Given research has demonstrated that CSE and CA are important antecedents to computing beiiefs ( Venkatesh and Davis 1996 ) and attitudes ( Harris 1999 ) , future research should examine if the effect of personal innovativeness on beliefs , ( e . g . , the ease of use of iT , and negative or positive attitudes toward computing ) is mediated by computer seif - efficacy and computer anxiety . More importantly , our findings iiiustrate how stable traits reiate to CA and CSE . Contrary to expec - tations , NA did not have a significant relationship with CA . However , consistent with prior research ( Weii and Wugaiter 1990 ) , TA demonstrated a positive association with CA . Further , NA and TA did not demonstrate significant direct effects on CSE . However , CA partiaily mediated PIIT ' s influence on CSE . in iight of PilTs significant direct effect on CSE , these findings provide sup - port for Bandura ' s ( 1997 ) argument that stable , situation - specific traits may provide insight into situation - specific efficacy beiiefs . However , this finding does not suggest that broad traits are not relevant to our understanding of CSE . Rather , it suggests that researchers need to seiect traits that most directiy relate to the dependent variable of interest ( Spector et ai . 2000 ) . These findings aiso suggest that it is important to distinguish between types of neuroticism . Although NA and TA have both been considered types of neuroticism , only TA had a positive asso - ciation with CA . High NA individuals experience a generaiized anxiety and dissatisfaction , regardiess 390 MIS Quarteriy Voi . 26 No . 4 / December 2002 Thatcher & Perrew ^ Cornputer Anxiety & Computer Seif - Efficacy of the situation . High TA individuals , however , experience anxiety when confronted with specific chalienges or problems such as using information technology . Given these differences , perhaps focusing on traits that are more reactive to specific challenges ( e . g . , TA ) will demonstrate more predictive validity than traits that are more general in nature ( e . g . , NA ) when examining IT use in organizations . Overall , findings shed light on how stable traits may affect CA and CSE . Research suggests that training interventions frequently exacerbate parti - cipants ' computer anxiety ( Marakas and Hornik 1996 ) and that training may sensitize participants to possible mistakes and lead them to report higher levels of CA . Thus , trait anxiety may serve as a contributor to the " cycle of computer anxiety " identified in prior research ( Marakas and Hornik 1996 ; Weil and Wugalter 1990 ) . To gain a richer understanding of the role of personality in IT , future research is needed to examine how different stable traits ( both broad and situation - specific ) relate to constructs , such as CA or CSE , that influence actual computer use . Practical Implications For the practicing professional , this research may have implications for implementing computer - training programs . Understanding the sources of self - efficacy or anxiety that influence IT training ' s effectiveness may help us design and place employees in training programs . We have identified two stable individual differences ( i . e . , PUT and TA ) that are associated with CA and one stable situation - specific trait ( i . e . , PUT ) that are associated with both CA and CSE . Because traits should exert a stable influence on dynamic indivi - dual differences ( i . e . , their influence doesn ' t change with training ) ( Chen et al . 2000 ) , it may be possible to use trait measures to place groups of employees in training programs . This would enable course designers to develop techniques that address the unique needs of different groups of IT users . For example , if participants are high on PUT , training may emphasize the new or interesting features of a new technology . If course design addresses participants ' predispositions to respond to stimuli ( i . e . , feel computer anxiety or self - efficacy ) , training will be more likely to lead to transferring lessons from the classroom to the workplace ( Karl et al . 1993 ) . Conclusion This study is a first step in developing a more robust understanding of individual differences that may inform managers ' decisions , enhance trainings ' effectiveness , and extend our under - standing of factors linked to computer usage . This study articulated and tested a conceptual model that posited three stable traits ( i . e . , PUT , NA , and TA ) would influence two dynamic ( i . e . , CA and CSE ) individual differences . Although there were no effects for NA , support for the relationships between PUT and TA with CA were supported . Given CA and CSE ' s influence on computing beliefs ( Marakas et al . 1998 ; Venkatesh and Davis 1996 ) , results underscore the importance of extending the nomological net surrounding dynamic individual differences in the IT context . By identifying how stable dispositional traits influence more dynamic , malleable individual differences such as CSE and CA , we may develop a more comprehensive model of how organiza - tions encourage IT acceptance and use .

About the Authors Jason Bennett Thatcher is an assistant profes - sor in the Department of Management in the Coilege of Business and Behaviorai Science at Ciemson University . He received his Ph . D . in Management Information Systems from Florida State University . His current research interests inciude individuai differences and behavior toward information technoiogy , strategic management of information technology , and the recruitment , motivation , and retention of IT workers . Pamela L . Perrewe is the Jim Moran Professor of Management and Associate Dean for Graduate Programs in the Coilege of Business at Fiorida State University . She received her Ph . D . in Organizational Behavior and Theory from the University of Nebraska . Her current research interests include the role of personality in organi - zational research , social support and controi as coping mechanisms for occupationai stress , coilective and seif - efficacy , and the role of moods and emotions In the organizational stress process . Appendix A Measures Used in the Study Computer Self - Efficacy ( Mean = 7 . 5 , Standard Deviation = 2 . 08 ) Computer self - efficacy was measured using 10 items developed by Compeau and Higgins ( 1995b ) . When using this measure , researchers have reported reiiabilities that range from 0 . 95 ( Compeau and Higgins 1995a ) to 0 . 91 ( Agarwai and Karahanna 2000 ) , Also , Agarwal and Karahanna reported a mean value of 7 . 32 ( std . dev . = ^ 1 . 7 ) fortheCompeauand Higgins CSE measure . Consistentwith prior research , analysis of the data indicates a reliability of 0 . 93 and mean of 7 . 5 ( std . dev . = 2 . 08 ) for the CSE measure . To coilect the data , respondents were asked to assess the magnitude and strength of their abiiity to use an unfamiliar computer software package . First , they indicated whether they believed they couid perform a task or not . Second , respondents assessed their level of confidence in the abiiity to perform tasks . Responses couid range from 1 = not confident to 10 = very confident , individuais with high computer seif - efficacy should have higher confidence in their capacity to perform tasks than those with lower computer seif - efficacy . The items were : 394 MiS Quarteriy Voi . 26 No . 4 / December 2002 Thatcher & Perrewe / Computer Arixiety & Computer Self - Efficacy Indicate if you could use the software under the condition by circling YES or NO . For each condition answered " Yes , " respondents rated confidence by writing in a number from 1 to 10 , where 1 indicate " Not at all confident , " and 10 indicates " Totally confident . " I could complete my job using the technology if . . . 1 , . . . there was no one around to tell me what to do 2 , . . . 1 had never used a package like it before , 3 , . . . I had only the software manuals for reference . 4 , , . . I had seen someone else using it before trying it myself , 5 , , , , I could call someone for help if I got stuck , 6 , , . , someone else helped me get started , 7 , , . . I had a lot of time to complete the job for which the software was provided . 8 , . . , I had just the built - in help facility for assistance 9 , . . . someone showed me how to do it first , 10 . . I had used similar packages like this one before to do the job . Computer Anxiety ( Mean = 2 . 87 , Standard Deviation = 1 . 04 ) Computer anxiety was measured using four items drawn from the Computer Anxiety Rating Scale ( Heinssen et al . 1987 ) . Respondents evaluated whether computers were intimidating or inspired apprehensive feelings ( on a scale of 1 to 7 ) . Compeau and Higgins ( 1995b ) identify these items as best capturing anxiety associated with computer use . Although Compeau and her colleagues have used this measure twice , they did not report means or standard deviations for this measure of computer anxiety in either MIS Quarterly an \ c \ e ( see Compeau and Higgins 1995b ; Compeau et al . 1999 ) , However , Compeau and her colleagues do report composite reliabilities ranging from of 0 . 92 ( Compeau et al . 1999 ) to 0 . 87 ( Compeau and Higgins 1995b ) . In the current study , data analysis indicates a composite reliability of 0 . 94 . 1 . I feel apprehensive about using computers . 2 . It scares me to think that I could cause the computer to destroy a large amount of information by hitting the wrong key . 3 . I hesitate to use a computer for fear of making mistakes that 1 cannot correct . 4 . Computers are somewhat intimidating to me . Trait Anxiety ( Mean = 3 . 12 , Standard Deviation = 1 . 28 ) Trait anxiety was measured using four items drawn from Lehrer and Woolfolk ( 1982 ) , The original 10 - item trait anxiety scale included items such as fear for misfortune to one ' s family or social sanctions . When evaluating the scale ' s psychometric properties , Lehrer and Woolfolk reported reliabilities ranging from 0 . 84 to 0 , 91 . They did not report means or standard deviations in their study . In this study , items were selected that evaluated individuals ' general preoccupation with problems . Similar to Lehrer and Woolfolk ' s study , the reduced scale reliability was 0 . 88 . Respondents were asked to report feelings of anxiety and mental preoccupation with problems experienced during a typical day ( on a scale of 1 to 7 ) , 1 . I picture some future misfortune . 2 . I can ' t get some thoughts out of my head . 3 . I keep busy to avoid uncomfortable thoughts , 4 . I have to be careful not to let my real feeling show . MIS Quarterly Vol . 26 No . 4 / December 2002 395 Thatcher & Perrew6 / Computer Anxiety & Computer Self - Efficacy Negative Affectivity ( Mean = 1 . 85 , Standard Deviation = 0 . 65 ) Negative affectivity was measured using 10 items from the positive and negative affect scale ( PANAS ) ( Watson et al . 1988 ) . Participants evaluated the degree to which they generally experience emotions such as hostility , guilt , or shame . Possible responses ranged from 1 ( very slightly or not at all ) to 5 ( extremely ) . In a recent study . Miles and Perrewe ( 2001 ) used the full 10 - item measure of NA and reported a mean of 1 . 58 ( std . dev . = . 62 ) and Cronbach ' s a of . 88 . In the current study , the 10 - item measure ' s mean was 1 . 80 ( std . dev . = . 55 ) with a Cronbach ' s a of . 81 , After two items were dropped from the measure due to low factor loadings indicated by an asterisk , NA ' s mean was 1 . 85 ( std . dev . = . 65 ) with the Cronbach ' s a of . 85 . Because of the comparable reliability and standard deviation estimates , we are comfortable with the psychometric properties ofthe reduced NA measure . 1 . scared 2 . irritable 3 . ashamed 4 . distressed 5 . hostile 6 . jittery 7 . afraid 8 . guilty 9 . upset * 10 . nervous " " Dropped due to low factor loading . Personal Innovativeness in IT ( Mean = 4 . 65 , Standard Deviation = 1 . 12 ) Personal innovativeness in IT was measured using four items developed by Agarwal and Prasad ( 1998a , 1998b ) . In a recent study of cognitive absorption and technology acceptance , Agarwal and Karahanna ( 2000 ) used these items and reported comparable values for the mean ( 4 . 87 , std . dev . = 1 . 07 ) and reliability ( composite reliability = 0 . 87 ) . The items reflect an individual ' s propensity to experiment with existing and new information technologies ( on a scale of 1 to 7 ) . 1 . If I heard abut a new information technology , I would look for ways to experiment with it . 2 . Among my peers , I am usually the first to try out new information technologies . 3 . In general , I am hesitant to try out new information technologies . 4 . I like to experiment with new information technologies . 396 MIS Quarterly Vol . 26 No . 4 / December 2002
