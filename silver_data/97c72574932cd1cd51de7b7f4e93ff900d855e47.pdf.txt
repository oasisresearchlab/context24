Abstract Altered synaptic bioactive lipid signaling has been recently shown to augment neuronal excitation in the hippocampus of adult animals by activation of presynaptic LPA 2 - receptors leading to increased presynaptic glutamate release . Here , we show that this results in higher postsynaptic Ca 2 + levels and in premature onset of spontaneous neuronal activity in the developing entorhinal cortex . Interestingly , increased synchronized neuronal activity led to reduced axon growth velocity of entorhinal neurons which project via the perforant path to the hippocampus . This was due to Ca 2 + - dependent molecular signaling to the axon affecting stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton . The spontaneous activity affected the entire entorhinal cortical network and thus led to reduced overall axon ﬁ ber numbers in the mature perforant path that is known to be important for speci ﬁ c memory functions . Our data show that precise regulation of early cortical activity by bioactive lipids is of critical importance for proper circuit formation .

Formation of this pathway follows a precise spatiotemporal pattern of axon outgrowth ( Del Rio et al . 1997 ) . In the develop - ing entorhinal cortex ( EC ) , periodic spontaneous glutamate receptor - mediated events parallel the outgrowth of the entorh - inal – hippocampal projection and show a characteristic time - locked increase during the ﬁ rst postnatal days ( Sheroziya et al . 2009 ; Unichenko et al . 2015 ) . In the early postnatal animal , space - encoding neurons show characteristic activity when the animal ﬁ rst starts to explore its environment , suggesting that the EC forms functional local excitatory connections to the hippocampus already during the early postnatal period ( Langston et al . 2010 ) . A role for early excitatory local activity in axon growth has been described in subcortical structures ( Mire et al . 2012 ) , indicating that early neuronal activity in the EC may be essential for the development of proper adult connectivity . Glutamate not only acts as a neurotransmitter at excitatory synapses in the entorhinal – hippocampal system but also regu - lates axon growth ( Yamada et al . 2008 ) . Application of gluta - mate to the somatodendritic area induced axon retraction via calcium waves that propagated from the cell body to the growth cone ( Yamada et al . 2008 ) . This is in line with recent data showing that electrical activity induced by optogenetic stimulation decreased horizontal axon growth of cortical neu - rons ( Malyshevskaya et al . 2013 ) . Here , we show that glutama - tergic signaling in the EC depending on proper regulation by synaptic bioactive phospholipid signaling critically in ﬂ uences axonal outgrowth and circuit formation via Ca 2 + - dependent pathways . This signaling pathway is regulated by the postsy - naptic molecule plasticity related gene 1 ( PRG - 1 / PLPR4 ) , which is an integral membrane protein and has a homology to lipid phosphate phosphatases , and is mediated via the presynaptic LPA 2 - receptor ( R ) in ﬂ uencing glutamate release ( Trimbuch et al . 2009 ) . PRG - 1 expression starts around birth ( Brauer et al . 2003 ) , concomitant with the development of the entorhinal – hippo - campal perforant path ( Del Rio et al . 1997 ) , and increases towards the end of the second postnatal week ( see Fig . S1a – c ) . This expression pattern suggests that entorhinal – hippocampal projection would be affected by increased glutamatergic trans - mission caused by PRG - 1 de ﬁ ciency . Indeed , in PRG - 1 − / − mice , which lack the postsynaptic PRG - 1 - dependent regulation of phospholipid signaling , we detected a premature appearance of early spontaneous glutamatergic activity in the EC by 2 days . This was mediated by presynaptic LPA 2 - Rs and led to Ca 2 + - dependent molecular signaling to the axon growth cone resulting in reduced axon growth velocity of entorhinal ﬁ bers . Reduced axon growth speed was due to speci ﬁ c alterations in Ca 2 + - dependent signal transduction ( Wayman et al . 2008 ) including increased phosphorylation of CaMKI but not of other members of the Ca 2 + / Calmodulin ( CaM ) - pathway . A target of the Ca 2 + / CaM - dependent protein kinases ( Takemura et al . 2009 ; Saito et al . 2013 ) , LimK1 , which inactivates co ﬁ lin activity via phosphorylation ( Mizuno 2013 ) , showed reduced phosphoryl - ation levels in the EC . Since co ﬁ lin negatively regulates actin dynamics and destabilizes axons via actin depolymerization ( Mizuno 2013 ; Saito et al . 2013 ) , reduced co ﬁ lin phosphorylation levels explain the negative effect on axon outgrowth of entorh - inal ﬁ bers to the hippocampus . Our ﬁ ndings show that precise regulation of local excitatory networks is critical for circuit formation in the entorhinal – hippocampal connection mediated via Ca 2 + - dependent axonal signaling pathways . Materials and Methods Transgenic Animals and Breeding PRG - 1 − / − and PRG - 1 − / − / LPA 2 - R − / − mice and their littermate con - trols were obtained as described ( Trimbuch et al . 2009 ) . For cocul - ture experiments , Thy - 1 . 2 - EGFP _ L17 ( Caroni 1997 ) and C57BL / 6 TgN ( ßact - EGFP ) Osb 1 ( Okabe et al . 1997 ) mice were crossbred with PRG - 1 − / − mice . All experiments involving animals were con - ducted in accordance with national laws for the use of animals in research and approved by the local ethical committee . Ca 2 + - Imaging and Electrophysiology In Vitro at P5 Slice preparation , extracellular ﬁ eld potential recordings , Ca 2 + - imaging and single cell electrophysiology were performed according to standard procedures ( Unichenko et al . 2015 , 2016 ) . EEPSCs were elicited by focal electrical stimulation through a glass pipette ﬁ lled with the ACSF ( ~ 10M Ω ) . The stimulation pip - ette was always positioned within layer 2 of MEC . N - ( 2 , 6 - dimethylphenylcarbamoylmethyl ) - triethylammonium bromide ( QX 314 , 2mM ) was added to the intracellular solution to pre - vent generation of action potentials in the tested neurons . An isolated stimulation unit was used to generate rectangular elec - trical pulses . Pulse duration was set to 0 . 2ms . Pulse intensity was adjusted to activate a unitary synaptic input ( minimal stimulation ) . Stimulation was accepted as minimal if the fol - lowing criteria were satis ﬁ ed : 1 ) eEPSC latency remained stable ( < 20 % ﬂ uctuations ) , 2 ) lowering stimulus intensity by 20 % resulted in a complete failure of eIPSCs , and 3 ) an increase in stimulus intensity by 20 % changed neither mean eEPSC ampli - tude nor eEPSC shape . In addition , eEPSCs were inspected at a holding potential of − 50 mV , Nernst Cl − reversal potential . Depolarizing eEPSCs recorded at this membrane potential con - ﬁ rmed the glutamatergic nature of the evoked signals . Typical pulse intensity was between 2 and 4 µ A . Surgical Preparation and In Vivo Recordings in P5 Mice Brie ﬂ y , after 30 – 60 min recovery from the surgical procedure ( Yang et al . 2013 ; Reyes - Puerta et al . 2015 ) , a 4 - shank 16 - channel electrode ( 125 µ m horizontal shank distance and 50 µ m vertical inter - electrode distance , 1 – 2 M Ω ; NeuroNexus Technologies ) or an 8 - shank 128 - channel electrode ( 200 µ m horizontal shank dis - tance and 75 µ m vertical inter - electrode distance , 1 – 2 M Ω ; NeuroNexus Technologies ) was inserted into cortical layer II / III of the anesthetized mouse to obtain FP recordings . One hour after the electrode was inserted into the EC , spontaneous activ - ity was recorded for 1 h . Usually , spontaneous events were recorded from 1 to 2 groups of channels . The channel with max - imum occurrence of spontaneous events was chosen for further analysis . Data Analysis of In Vivo Recordings FP data were imported and analyzed of ﬂ ine using MATLAB soft - ware version 7 . 7 ( MathWorks ) . In each experiment , 900s spontan - eous extracellular local FP recording was used for the analysis . To detect spontaneous events , raw data were ﬁ ltered between 1 and 80Hz using a Butterworth 3 - order ﬁ lter . Spontaneous events were detected as FP de ﬂ ections exceeding 5 times the baseline stand - ard deviation ( SD ) . The events were analyzed in their occurrence , 132 | Cerebral Cortex , 2017 , Vol . 27 , No . 1 duration , and frequency with maximal fast Fourier transform - ation power within event . MUA was detected in 200Hz highpass ﬁ ltered signals by applying a threshold at 7 times the baseline SD . We calculate the MUA ﬁ ring rate in channels located in MEC and further calculate the mean MUA ﬁ ring rate from the chan - nels with MUA ﬁ ring rate > 0 . Measurement of Axon Outgrowth Using Ex Vivo Organotypical Slice Cultures Live - Imaging Measurements Organotypic slice cultures containing EC from GFP - expressing transgenic mice and hippocampus from non - GFP transgenic mice were performed as described . After DIV3 cocultures were placed in a preheated chamber ( 37 ° C ) aerated with humidi ﬁ ed 5 % CO 2 ambient air ( Ludin chamber , Life Imaging Services ) . Imaging of outgrowing entorhinal axons in living slice cultures was performed using a microscope ( TCS SP2 , Leica ) equipped with a 2 - photon laser ( Coherent , Titan : Saphire Chameleon ) . GFP ﬂ uorescence was obtained at an excitation wavelength of 900nm and was imaged using a 20x water objective ( Olympus XLUMPlanFL 0 . 95 NA ) . Axon growth velocity was calculated measuring the distance covered by single axons over time . Before imaging , slices were equilibrated for at least 1h in the imaging chamber . Multiple optical sections ( up to 30 sections , z - spacing of 0 . 8 µ m ) were collected every 10 min for up to 3 h . This observation condition did not induce photobleaching of GFP ﬂ uorescence nor did it alter axon outgrowth speed during the experiment . According to experimental conditions , 0 . 5mM glutamate was directly applied to the medium . For data ana - lysis , optical sections were reconstructed into single projection images for each time point using the maximum brightness operation of the Leica software . Each data point represents the outgrowth speed of 1 axon ﬁ ber . For analysis of the axon growth , individual axon growth speed during imaging was grouped in growth categories using the advance phase of WT → WT as a standard .

An inhibitor cocktail containing TTX ( 1 µ M ) , CNQX ( 20 µ M ) , and nifedipine ( 10 µ M ) ( all from Sigma ) was added to the cultures that were incubated for 48 h before microscopic analysis . To evaluate the axonal outgrowth of the explants , neurite density was analyzed 100 µ m in front of the concave side of the explant with ImageJ . Each data point represents measurements in 1 entorhinal slice culture . Axon outgrowth was normalized to the mean value of the corresponding PRG - 1 - expressing slices . Measurement of Axonal Ingrowth of GFP - expressing Axons into the Dentate Gyrus Experiments were performed according to established protocols ( Walsh et al . 2015a ; Vogt et al . 2012 ) . Brie ﬂ y , after 3 days in vitro , ( DIV3 ) or after DIV7 , respectively , cultures were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) , resliced , coverslipped , and imaged with a ﬂ uorescence microscope ( Olympus , BX 50 ) equipped with a Cool SNAP ES digital camera ( Roper Scienti ﬁ c ) . To measure axonal ingrowth , ﬂ uorescence intensity of the GFP - positive EC projection was determined in the ML using the soft - ware ImageJ or MetaMorph ( Molecular Devices ) . Two regions of interest ( ROIs , all ROIs were identical ) comprising the full width of the ML were randomly selected in the ML and in the DG . The average ﬂ uorescence in the DG was used to determine the background ﬂ uorescence , and the difference in ﬂ uorescence intensity between the ML and the DG re ﬂ ected the speci ﬁ c ﬁ ber ingrowth in the ML . Data were normalized to the ﬂ uorescence intensity of ﬁ ber ingrowth of WT → WT ( Fig . 3 f , g ) . Immunohistochemistry Cocultures with entorhinal cortices from Thy - 1 . 2 - EGFP _ L17 mice growing into the PRG - 1 - de ﬁ cient hippocampal target tis - sue ( EGFP - negative ) were ﬁ xed with 4 % PFA , resliced , and incu - bated with an antibody against Calbindin ( Swant , Bellinzona ) or with accustom - made antibody against PRG - 1 ( Trimbuch et al . 2009 ) . For developmental expression studies , antibodies against autotaxin ( Tanaka et al . 2004 ) , LPA 2 - receptor ( Trimbuch et al . 2009 ) , VGlut1 ( Synaptic Systems ) , GFAP ( DAKO ) , ß - Gal ( Abcam ) , and Calbindin and Calretinin ( Swant ) were used . Secondary antibodies Al 488 or AL 568 ( Invitrogen ) were applied overnight at 4 ° C . For DAB conversion , biotinylated secondary antibodies were used and DAB - staining was performed as described ( Vogt et al . 2012 ) . For assessment of PRG - 1 expression , heterozygous PRG - 1 - de ﬁ cient mice expressing a ß - Gal reporter were used ( for detailed description , see Trimbuch et al . , ( 2009 ) ) . Confocal imaging was performed on a Leica TCS SP8 or on a Leica TCS SL confocal laser scanning microscope . Analysis of Phosphorylation Levels Western blot analysis of brain lysates or of puri ﬁ ed phospho - proteins was performed following standard procedures . Brie ﬂ y , P5 animals were killed and entorhinal cortices from 2 animals ( for WT versus PRG - 1 − / − ) or 3 animals ( for WT versus LPA 2 - R − / − or PRG - 1 − / − / LPA 2 - R − / − , respectively ) were pooled to one bio - logical sample and analyzed as described in the ﬁ gure legends for the respective experiment . A total of 2 . 5 mg of protein was then loaded onto the PhosphoProtein puri ﬁ cation column ( Qiagen ) . Fractions containing phosphorylated proteins were reduced to 200 µ L using Startorius stedim biotech Columns . Protein levels using western blot analysis was performed using following antibodies : CamKI ( 1 : 2000 ; AbCam ) , Calmodulin ( 1 : 1000 ; Millipore ) , CamKK ( 1 : 500 ; AbCam ) , CamKIV ( 1 : 1000 ; Cell Signaling ) , pCamKI ( 1 : 100 ; provided by Naohito Nozaki and described in Tokumitsu et al . , ( 2004 ) ) , LimK1 , pLimK1 / 2 , Co ﬁ lin and pCo ﬁ lin ( 1 : 1000 ; Cell Signaling ) , and beta - actin ( 1 : 10 . 000 ; MP Biomedicals , LLC ) . Subsequently , blots were processed for 1h at room temperature with HRP - conjugated anti - mouse and anti - rabbit secondary antibodies ( 1 : 5000 ; Dianova ) . Densitometric analyzes were performed using ImageJ . Viral Infection and Fiber Outgrowth Assessment Complex hippocampal – entorhinal slice cultures were prepared from E18 pregnant conditional PRG - 1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice and infected using an AAV expressing mCherry or Cre and mCherry under the synapsin promotor . In the AAVs , a 480bp fragment of the synapsin ( Syn ) promoter ( Kugler et al . 2003 ) controlled neuronal expression of Cre - mCherry , whereby a 2A - mediated peptide cleavage linker ( Donnelly et al . 2001 ) was introduced between Cre recombinase and mCherry to enable the production of 2 separate protein products . The production of the AAV 1 / 2 EGFP ( titer 1 . 0 × 10 11 copies / ml ) of the AAV 6 Syn - mCherry ( titer 1 . 05 × 10 12 copies / ml ) and of the AAV 6 Syn - Cre - mCherry ( titer 6 . 55 × 10 11 copies / ml ) was performed as previously described ( Guggenhuber et al . 2010 ) . After slice preparation , Syn - mCherry , Syn - Cre - mCherry or EGFP expressing AAV were injected at a dilution of 1 : 5 in the EC using glass pipettes attached to a microinjection device ( Toohey Spritzer ) . In line with recent data ( Aschauer et al . 2013 ) , we did not see differences in infec - tion ef ﬁ ciency between these 2 AAV serotypes . After 5 days , in vitro ( DIV5 ) slices were ﬁ xed , resliced , and restained for a better visualization of mCherry ﬁ lled axons ( 1 : 1000 ; Rockland ) . Fluorescent images were taken on a Leica SP8 equipped with a white light laser and HyD detectors . For visualization of the axonal projection , 7 . 5 µ m thick image stacks were used in the maximal projection . Image analysis was performed with ImageJ . To avoid bias by unspeci ﬁ c background staining , a threshold was measured in areas devoid of axonal projections ( e . g . , granule cell layer of the DG , which contains the cell bod - ies ) and subtracted from the images . Gray values were mea - sured in the ROIs that comprised the entorhinal performant path projection in the ML of the DG or the infected neurons in the EC . Since AAV application may infect varying amounts of EC neurons , gray values of the EC performant path projection was correlated to the number of infected cells and calculated as a ratio to the gray values of the infected EC - cells . Analysis of PRG - 1 expression upon cre - infection was performed by immuno ﬂ uorescent staining using a custom - made rabbit anti - PRG - 1 antibody as described ( Trimbuch et al . 2009 ) . Stereological Analysis of Entorhinal Perforant Path Axons Myelin staining was performed according to standard proce - dures and was quanti ﬁ ed using unbiased high - precision stereo - logical methods ( Vogt et al . 2009 ) . Brie ﬂ y , brains were cut in serial sections on a vibratome , and every forth section was selected and stained . De ﬁ nition of the ROI in the hippocampus : EC ﬁ bers crossing the hippocampal ﬁ ssure were stereologically counted . This ROI was delimited by characteristic anatomical formation of the hippocampus and the ﬁ mbria . Every second section of the following 10 was used for stereological assess - ment . The number of EC ﬁ bers in individual animals was 136 | Cerebral Cortex , 2017 , Vol . 27 , No . 1 normalized to the mean of the WT group or to the mean of the LPA 2 - R − / − group representing the strain background . Statistical Analysis After assessing for normal distribution ( using the Kolmogorov – Smirnov test ) , statistical analyses between the 2 groups were calculated as using a t - test for normal distributed data or with a Mann – Whitney U test for nonparametric data . Statistical ana - lyses between more than 2 groups were performed using an one - way analysis of variance with a Bonferroni correction for normal distributed data or a Kruskal – Wallis test and a Dunn ’ s post hoc comparison for nonparametric data . All statistical cal - culations were performed with GraphPad Software ( GraphPad Software , Inc . ) . Results Appearance of Excitatory Activity and Postsynaptic Ca 2 + Transients in Developing Entorhinal Neurons Depends on Phospholipid Signaling Periodic spontaneous glutamatergic events in the EC incremen - tally develop during the ﬁ rst postnatal week ( Unichenko et al . 2015 ) and decrease towards the end of the second postnatal week ( Sheroziya et al . 2009 ) . We investigated the role of bio - active phospholipids in regulation of these local excitatory activity and their consequences for circuit formation . To this end , we used PRG - 1 − / − mice which , at adult ages , were reported to have an increased synaptic lysophospholipid signaling resulting in enhanced presynaptic glutamate release mediated via presynaptic LPA 2 - R ( Trimbuch et al . 2009 ) . First , we analyzed neuronal activity at single cell level at P5 in layer II of the EC . PRG - 1 − / − neurons displayed signi ﬁ cant higher mEPSC frequencies with unaltered amplitudes ( Fig . 1 a , b , Table S1 ) . Since altered mEPSC frequency implies a presynaptic effect , we measured paired pulse ratios to prove for this assumption . Therefore , we recorded evoked EPSC ( eEPCSs ) elicited by paired pulse electrical stimulation in the presence of GABA A receptor blocker gabazine ( 10 µ M , Fig . 1 c ) . Paired pulse ratio was signi ﬁ cantly higher in wild - type ( WT ) mice as compared with PRG - 1 − / − littermates ( Fig . 1 c , d ) . In PRG - 1 − / − , the mean amplitude of eEPSCs was increased , while failure rate , i . e . , number of trials in which an electrical pulse failed to elicit the ﬁ rst eEPSC in a pair , was decreased ( Fig . 1 e ) . These ﬁ ndings re ﬂ ect an increased basal presynaptic glutamate release and neuronal hyperexcitability of PRG - 1 − / − developing entorhinal neurons as previously shown for CA1 - neurons in adult PRG - 1 − / − animals ( Trimbuch et al . 2009 ) . We next analyzed which type of glutamate receptor mediates the effects of the increased presynaptic release using subtype - speci ﬁ c inhibi - tors . As the mean amplitude of mEPSCs is small , we recorded eEPSCs at P5 , elicited in MEC L2 neurons by electrical stimula - tion in close proximity to a cell of interest in the presence of gabazine ( 10 µ M ) , a GABAA receptor blocker . NBQX ( 10 µ M ) , a selective AMPA ( but not kainate ) receptor antagonist , com - pletely blocked eEPCSs both in slices from PRG - 1 − / − animals ( n = 4 ) , and from their WT littermates ( n = 5 , data not shown ) . However , NASPM ( 25 µ M ) , a Ca 2 + - permeable AMPA receptor blocker failed to affect eEPSCs both in slices from PRG - 1 − / − ani - mals or from their WT littermates ( Fig . S1d , e ) , suggesting that mostly Ca 2 + - impermeable AMPA receptors mediate glutamater - gic synaptic transmission .

( a ) Axonoutgrowth number was lower in PRG - 1 − / − EC explants ( when compared with WT EC explants ) and rescued to WT levels upon inhibition of neuronal activity ( 1 µ M TTX , 10 µ M Nifedipine , 20 µ M CNQX ) .

Phospholipids Modulate Cortical Circuit Formation Vogt et al . | 137 PRG - 1 − / − animals or in WT littermates ( Fig . S1f , g ) . As both sub - stances did not affect PPR , the presynaptic expression of func - tional kainate and / or Ca 2 + - permeable AMPA receptors appears to be unlikely . From these data , we conclude that contribu - tions of both kainate and Ca 2 + - permeable AMPA receptors to glutamatergic transmission in L2 of mEC at P5 is minor and that postsynaptic responses are predominantly mediated by Ca 2 + - impermeable AMPA receptors . Analyses of active cells in layer II of PRG - 1 − / − MEC slices using Ca 2 + imaging revealed signi ﬁ cantly increased percentage of active cells exhibiting Ca 2 + transients at P3 and at P5 re ﬂ ect - ing increased discharge rates in the MEC layer II neurons ( Fig . 1 f ) . This shows that immature entorhinal neuron activity is regulated by bioactive phospholipids . Altered phospholipid signaling results in higher basal glutamate release that aug - ments the neuronal ﬁ ring probability leading to increased Ca 2 + - concentrations in individual neurons . Premature Onset of Excitatory Activity in Entorhinal Neurons Alters Axon Outgrowth Neuronal activity was shown to affect axon outgrowth in dif - ferent systems ( Gomez and Spitzer 1999 ; Mire et al . 2012 ) . We therefore established 2 - photon live - imaging in organotypic entorhinal – hippocampal cocultures ( Fig . 2 a , S Movie1 ) , which maintain all elements of the trisynaptic hippocampal cir - cuitry and are regarded as an ex vivo model displaying a com - parable development of the entorhinal projection to the situation in vivo ( Frotscher et al . 2000 ) . Organotypic slice cul - tures were prepared from newborn mice , when entorhinal axons start to enter the dentate gyrus ( Del Rio et al . 1997 ) . Ingrowing axons were imaged after 3 days in vitro ( DIV3 , which is comparable with P3 in vivo ( see also Fig . S2 a , b ) , when excitatory activity of entorhinal neurons was almost not present , and at DIV5 ( comparable with P5 in vivo ) , when robust excitatory discharge activity was observed in WT ani - mals . Axon growth velocity at DIV5 ( when entorhinal axons started to contact their targets , the granule cell dendrites ( Frotscher et al . 2000 ) ) was signi ﬁ cantly decreased when com - pared with DIV3 ( Fig . 2 b ) . This decrease of axon growth speed at arrival in its synaptic target region is in line with axon behavior described in other systems ( Stamatakou et al . 2015 ) . Thus , decreased axon growth speed at DIV5 correlates with increased Ca 2 + transients in WT slices at P5 ( Fig . 3 d ) . In order to understand the mechanisms underlying these developmental changes , we performed detailed analyses of axon growth . Since axon growth is not uniform but rather complex containing peri - ods 1 , where axons display a fast outgrowth , 2 , where axon growth speed slows down or 3 , where axons stop growing or 4 , even retract , we have analyzed axon outgrowth according to these categories . Detailed analysis of axon outgrowth dynamics revealed that increased discharge activity of entorhinal neurons at DIV5 ( when compared with DIV3 ) signi ﬁ cantly altered pattern switching axon growth from a fast advancing category ( adv ) to a slow outgrowth category ( slow ) ( Fig . 2 c 1 – 3 ) , Here , axon growth speed was more than 50 % slower than in the fast advancing cat - egory ( Fig . S2c ) . Interestingly , DIV5 axons displayed a signi ﬁ cant decrease in axon outgrowth speed in the fast advancing cat - egory , while the axon growth speed in the slow category was not changed pointing to the fact that increased synchronized neuronal activity speci ﬁ cally affected periods of fast axon out - growth ( Fig . S2c ) .

Interestingly , growth rates of PRG - 1 − / − axons were signi ﬁ cantly lower independent whether the target region , here the hippo - campus , was derived from PRG - 1 expressing or from PRG - 1 - de ﬁ cient mice ( Fig . 2 e ) . These ﬁ ndings argue against a change in attractive properties of the target region in PRG - 1 − / − mice as an underlying cause for the observed changes . To exclude possible bias by transient PRG - 1 expression in the growth cone , which might account for a decreased outgrowth speed of axons derived from PRG - 1 − / − neurons , we analyzed WT growth cones in detail but found no PRG - 1 expression in these structures ( Fig . S2 e – h ) . Moreover , analysis of growth categories revealed that DIV3 axons derived from PRG - 1 − / − entorhinal neurons displayed a similar switch from a fast advancing category towards a slow outgrowth category as observed for DIV5 WT - ﬁ bers ( Fig . 2 f 1 – 3 ) . This suggests a speci ﬁ c role of increased discharge activity as cause for decreased outgrowth of axons originating from PRG - 1 − / − entorhinal neurons . In line , outgrowth speed of axons originating from PRG - 1 − / − neurons was decreased in the fast advancing category , while no changes in outgrowth speed were observed in the slow outgrowth category pointing to a speci ﬁ c effect of neuronal activity and postsynaptic Ca 2 + increase on fast outgrowing axons ( Fig . S2d ) . Moreover , devel - opmental analysis of the regions where the perforant path ori - ginates ( the EC ) as well as of the region where it terminates and makes synaptic connections [ the dentate grus { DG } ] did not reveal differences in maturation arguing against bias by an altered maturation of these regions in PRG - 1 − / − animals ( Fig .

Since increased discharge activity indicated elevated gluta - matergic levels in the MEC of PRG - 1 − / − , we tested this assump - tion via direct manipulation of axon growth by glutamate application ( 500 µ M ) . Already 10 min after glutamate applica - tion , axon growth rates signi ﬁ cantly decreased ( Fig . 2 g 1 – 2 , 2 h ) and remained at low levels throughout the whole experi - ment ( Fig . 2 h , i ) . Axon growth velocity was not signi ﬁ cantly different after 10 and 70 min of glutamate application arguing against a progressive neuronal damage induced by glutamate ( Fig . 2 i ) . Premature Onset of Excitatory Activity in Assemblies of Entorhinal Neurons Alters Outgrowth in the Entorhinal – Hippocampal Projection An increase in mEPSCs leading to neuronal hyperexcitability may affect large group of neurons eventually leading to epilep - tic discharges ( Fang 2016 ) .

To directly determine affection of postsynaptic Ca 2 + - levels , we imaged Ca 2 + - changes in the same MEC slices prep - aration ( Fig . 3 b ) . Field potential measurements revealed signi ﬁ - cantly increased number of events revealing that spontaneous glutamatergic activity affecting large groups of neurons occurs at signi ﬁ cantly higher rates in layer II of PRG - 1 − / − MEC slices at P3 and P5 when compared with the respective WT slices ( Fig . 3 c ) . These data argue for the fact that synaptic phospholi - pids that regulate presynaptic basal glutamate release and thereby increase excitatory activity of the single neurons , increase synchronous ﬁ ring rates of large neuronal populations in the MEC . This supports the general idea that spontaneously active neurons are required for the initiation of synchronous glutamatergic events comprising large groups of neurons . To analyze the effect of bioactive phospholipids on neuronal Ca 2 + changes following discharges spreading over large areas of the layer II MEC , we analyzed the number of Ca 2 + transients simul - taneously occurring in distant regions of the MEC as depicted in Figure 3 a , b . In line with the results shown in Figure 3 c , we found highly signi ﬁ cant increases in these global events at P3 and at P5 in the MEC of PRG - 1 − / − mice ( for direct comparison of synchronous network discharges at P3 , P5 , P7 , see Fig . S3a ) . To prove the direct role of synaptic phospholipids and their spe - ci ﬁ c presynaptic LPA 2 - R , we further analyzed the occurrence of these global excitatory events in PRG - 1 − / − animals on an LPA 2 - R − / − background ( for exemplary presynaptic LPA 2 - R expression at P5 , see Fig . S3e , f ) and found levels that were not different to WT values ( Fig . 3 d , middle ) suggesting that premature develop - ment of local excitatory networks is mediated via presynaptic LPA 2 - Rs . Furthermore , to exclude bias due to an altered amount of presynaptic inputs , we have assessed the dendrite - associated VGlut1 - punctae in layer II of the MEC at P5 in WT , PRG - 1 − / − and LPA2 − / − mice ﬁ nding no difference in presynaptic terminals between these genotypes ( Fig . S3g – l ) . To corroborate the role of LPA 2 - R and its cognate ligand LPA , we analyzed phospholipid signal transduction at the level of the LPA - synthesizing enzyme Autotaxin ( ATX , for ATX - expression at P5 see Fig . S3d ) . Therefore , we applied 10 µ M HA130 , an inhibitor of ATX , able to reduce LPA levels ( Albers et al . 2010 ) and observed a signi ﬁ cant decrease of discharge frequency in slices from PRG - 1 − / − mice at P5 ( Fig . 3 e ) . Altogether , we provide mechanistic and molecular evidence at different levels of the LPA / LPA 2 - R / PRG - 1 axis showing that altered synaptic LPA levels leading to increased basal presynaptic gluta - mate release eventually induced premature activity of excitatory networks in the EC , which critically affected axon outgrowth . To prove that not only single axons but also the entire per - forant path projection was affected by premature neuronal net - work activity , we analyzed the development of the whole EC projection using organotypic slice cultures . In this well - established approach ( Walsh et al . 2015 ) , axons from EC of β - actin - green ﬂ uorescent protein ( GFP ) expressing animals are growing into hippocampus of β - actin - GFP – negative animals enabling quantitative assessment of ingrowing ﬁ bers to their target . In line with the live - imaging data on single axon level ( Fig . 2 d , e ) , the axonal projection derived from PRG - 1 − / − entorh - inal slices was signi ﬁ cantly diminished . To prove that this effect indeed resulted from altered lipid signaling , we mim - icked this effect in WT slices and treated these organotypic slice cultures with LPA ﬁ nding a similar effect as observed in PRG - 1 − / − slices ( Fig . S3b , c ) . Alltogether , these data con ﬁ rm the inverse relationship of increased excitatory discharge activity in the area of origin , the EC , and the lower outgrowth of the corresponding axonal projection . Excitatory Activity Mediated by Bioactive Lipid Signaling Controls Axon Outgrowth in the Entorhinal – Hippocampal System The effect of excitatory discharge activity was further tested on outgrowing axons from EC explants . Quantitative analysis revealed that axon numbers derived from PRG - 1 − / − EC slices explanted at P1 and cultivated for 48 h ( corresponding to P3 in vivo , a time point when discharge activity was almost absent in WT but signi ﬁ cantly increased in PRG - 1 − / − entorh - inal slices ) was signi ﬁ cantly lower but was rescued to WT levels when neuronal activity was blocked by a cocktail con - taining TTX , CNQX , and nifedipine ( Fig . 4 a , b ) . Since PRG - 1 - de ﬁ ciency altered synaptic LPA signaling and application of LPA on WT slices mimicked increased glutamatergic levels present in PRG - 1 − / − mice ( Trimbuch et al . 2009 ) , we investi - gated whether reduced outgrowth of axons from PRG - 1 − / − mice was mediated via presynaptic LPA 2 - receptors . Using WT and PRG - 1 − / − mice on an LPA 2 - R − / − background that blocks lipid signaling at the presynapse ( Trimbuch et al . 2009 ) , we found no more differences between axon outgrowth from WT and from PRG - 1 − / − slices ( Fig . 4 c , d ) . These results con ﬁ rm that the PRG - 1 effect on axon outgrowth was indeed mediated by presynaptic LPA 2 - receptors , which is supported by electro - physiological data showing that LPA 2 - receptors mediate pre - mature onset of neuronal activity upon increased lipid signaling in PRG - 1 − / − mice ( Fig . 3 d ) . Cell - type - speci ﬁ c PRG - 1 Deletion Reduces EC Axon Outgrowth We next aimed to provide direct evidence for the role of post - synaptic PRG - 1 in axon outgrowth from the EC to the hippo - campus . Therefore , we performed cell - type - speci ﬁ c PRG - 1 deletion using adeno associated virus ( AAV ) cre - expression in a subset of entorhinal neurons carrying a ﬂ oxed PRG - 1 gene . The used AAVs ( serotype 1 / 2 or 6 ) have a similar neuronal infection ef ﬁ ciency in the hippocampus ( Aschauer et al . 2013 ) . Cre - expression occurred under the synapsin promotor , thereby limiting cre - expression and PRG - 1 deletion to infected neurons . Infected neurons were visualized via enhanced green ﬂ uores - cent protein ( EGFP ) or mCherry expression , both well - described ﬂ uorescent proteins for axonal studies ( Bochorishvili et al . 2014 ; Liu et al . 2014 ) . These ﬂ uorescent proteins were co - expressed by the AAVs and stained cell bodies as well as their axons . Control AAVs expressed EGFP only . As shown in Figure 5 a , infected EC neurons in control slices ( neuronal cell bodies in control slices are shown in Fig . 5d ) formed a well - de ﬁ ned axonal projection terminating in the molecular layer ( ML ) of the DG . However , albeit robust neuronal EC infection by the cre - expressing virus , the perforant path projection ori - ginating from the infected and PRG - 1 - de ﬁ cient neurons ( shown in Fig . 5 e ) was signi ﬁ cantly weaker ( Fig . 5 b , c ) . To prove for ef ﬁ ciency of PRG - 1 deletion , we resliced and immunos - tained cre - transfected slices for PRG - 1 . As shown exemplarily in Figure 5 f , infected EC neurons identi ﬁ ed by mCherry expres - sion were clearly PRG - 1 depleted , while unaffected neurons located close to infected cells displayed strong PRG - 1 expres - sion . These data argue for a critical role of postsynaptic PRG - 1 in controlling synaptic phospholipid signaling , excitatory activity , and Ca 2 + levels , thereby eventually determining the number of axons that reach their target at a given time during development .

Activity - dependent protein phosphorylation is a key process in regulation and ﬁ ne - tuning of intracellular functions . We therefore analyzed phosphorylation of downstream mole - cules of the Calmodulin ( CaM ) - pathway in the EC of P5 WT and PRG - 1 − / − animals by phosphoprotein puri ﬁ cation and western blotting . Here , we found signi ﬁ cantly higher phosphorylation levels of CaMKI , a molecule critically involved in axon out - growth ( Ageta - Ishihara et al . 2009 ) , in PRG - 1 − / − animals when compared with WT litters ( Fig . 6 a , b ) . In contrast , we found no changes in phosphorylation of other calmodulin kinases ( CaM , CamKII , CamKK , CaMKIV , Fig . S4a – d ) . Higher phosphorylation levels of CaMKI in the EC were further corroborated using a speci ﬁ c antibody against pThr177 ( Fig . 6 c ) . In addition , using this antibody , we found a similar increase in Thr177 phosphor - ylation of CaMKI in the phosphoprotein enriched fraction from PRG - 1 − / − mice and found no signal in the ﬂ owthrough - fraction ( Fig . S4e ) . This corroborates the above - mentioned results and points to an effective phosphoprotein puri ﬁ cation procedure . Since neuronal hyperexcitation in PRG - 1 − / − mice required acti - vation of presynaptic LPA 2 - R ( Trimbuch et al . 2009 ) and add - itional deletion of this receptor reduced neuronal activity in PRG - 1 − / − slices ( Fig . 3 d ) and rescued the axon growth de ﬁ cit in PRG - 1 − / − explants to WT levels ( Fig . 4 c , d ) , we analyzed CaMKI phosphorylation in EC lysate from PRG - 1 − / − mice on an LPA 2 - R - de ﬁ cient background . Here , we found normal CaMKI phos - phorylation ( Fig . 6 d ) supporting the idea that normalized neuronal activity in the EC , as present in PRG - 1 − / − / LPA 2 - R − / − , rescued axon growth via Ca 2 + - dependent signal transduction . Since Ca 2 + - induced signaling was reported to regulate mole - cules directly involved in remodeling of the axon ’ s actin cytoskel - eton like LimK1 ( Saito et al . 2013 ) , we analyzed their expression and found signi ﬁ cantly decreased levels of phosphorylated LimK1 / 2 while total protein levels of LimK1 were not altered ( Fig . 6 e , f ) . LimK1 is critically involved in phosphorylation and thereby deactivation of co ﬁ lin , which in its active form stimulates actin depolymerization and disruption of actin ﬁ la - ments ( Mizuno 2013 ) . Therefore , we further assessed co ﬁ lin and its phosphorylation levels ﬁ nding unaltered protein levels but signi ﬁ cantly decreased levels of phosphorylated co ﬁ lin ( Fig . 6 g , h ) . This is in line with lower LimK1 / 2 phosphorylation levels and lower axon growth rates in axons derived from PRG - 1 − / − slices . Consequences of Premature Entorhinal Activity for the Adult Brain To test whether changes in the onset of excitatory activity in assemblies of entorhinal networks also occur in vivo , we recorded spontaneous ﬁ eld potentials in layer II / III of the MEC in living P5 WT and PRG - 1 − / − mice . As depicted in Figure 7 a 1 by color codes re ﬂ ecting the multiunit electrical activity ( MUA ) measured by an 8 - shank 128 - channel electrode , synchronous excitatory network activity was highly present in the EC of PRG - 1 − / − mice . Quantitative analysis revealed a signi ﬁ cantly higher occurrence of discharges and an increased mean ﬁ ring rate in the MEC of PRG - 1 − / − mice , con ﬁ rming the critical role of synaptic bioactive phospholipids in early excitatory network activity in the EC in vivo ( Fig . 7 a 1 – 5 ) . Next , we assessed the impact of premature network activity for the mature perforant path at a structural level in vivo and quanti ﬁ ed this projection in adult animals . Using a chemical staining approach of single axons , we labeled the EC perforant projection , which crosses the hippocampal ﬁ ssure where it can be visualized at the single ﬁ ber level ( Fig . 7 b , black box indicat - ing the hippocampal ﬁ ssure , and higher magni ﬁ cation of entorhinal axons in the insert ) . Axon ﬁ ber density in PRG - 1 − / − animals was visibly lower than in WT animals ( Fig . 7 c ) . Using unbiased high - precision stereological methods and serial sec - tions , we assessed the number of axons per animal crossing the hippocampal ﬁ ssure . To compare the results independently of the animal background , we calculated ﬁ ber number per ani - mal as a percentage of control ﬁ bers and found a signi ﬁ cant lower number of axons in PRG - 1 − / − mice compared with their WT litters ( Fig . 7 d ) . Since additional LPA 2 - R deletion restored early excitatory activity in the EC and axonal outgrowth to WT levels , we analyzed axon ﬁ ber numbers in WT and PRG - 1 − / − mice on an LPA 2 - R − / − background ( Fig . 7 e , f ) . We found no longer differences as seen in PRG - 1 − / − mice ( Fig . 7 g ) con ﬁ rming the effect of premature increase of entorhinal activity on circuit formation up to adult ages . Discussion Our study demonstrates that bioactive phospholipids modulate the onset of early neuronal activity in the developing EC and play a critical role in the formation of proper entorhinal – hippo - campal connectivity . This was mediated by glutamate - dependent Ca 2 + - signaling in entorhinal neurons via CaMKI and downstream pathways involving LimKI and co ﬁ lin , controlling the stability of the axonal cytoskeleton . Proper appearance of excitatory entorhinal network activity comprising large groups of neurons during critical periods of the development of the entorhinal projection to the hippocampus is under the control of synaptic phospholipid signaling and regulates the amount of ﬁ bers of this projection . The general view on early neuronal activity , so far , focused on defects in circuit formation upon its inhibition ( Catalano and Shatz 1998 ; Hanson and Landmesser 2004 ) . Here , we show that premature induction of entorhinal excitatory activity — by only 2 days before its normal appear - ance — decreased axon growth thereby causing structural alterations in the adult animal . Phospholipids Modulate Entorhinal Activity Affecting Axon Outgrowth Spontaneous network activity in the developing brain is a hall - mark of young neuronal circuits and is homeostatically regulated ( Hanson and Landmesser 2004 ; Blankenship and Feller 2010 ) . Here , we show that the bioactive phospholipid LPA and its post - synaptic regulatory molecule PRG - 1 are key players in this homeostatic control within the entorhinal – hippocampal circuit . While genetic studies suggested that spontaneous neuronal activity was suf ﬁ cient for embryonic ﬁ ber tract development ( Molnar et al . 2002 ) , recent studies show that increased glutama - tergic levels at the somatodendritic compartment inhibited neur - ite outgrowth ( Yamada et al . 2008 ; Malyshevskaya et al . 2013 ) . This is in line with our live - imaging analysis of outgrowing ﬁ bers showing that enhanced glutamatergic activity slows down axon growth , which could be rescued by blocking neuronal activity . Furthermore , our data do not support a negative effect of 142 | Cerebral Cortex , 2017 , Vol . 27 , No . 1 putative higher LPA concentrations in the PRG - 1 - de ﬁ cient hippo - campus on ingrowing entorhinal axons , which is conceivable from other experimental settings ( Campbell and Holt 2003 ) , but argue for the critical importance of the degree of glutamatergic activity . To prove that the observed reduced axon outgrowth was the direct result of increased excitatory drive of the outgrowing postsynaptic neuron , we performed cell - type - speci ﬁ c PRG - 1 deletion in entorhinal neurons that are embedded in an other - wise unaltered environment . Hereby , we could show that altered bioactive synaptic lipid signaling due to lack of postsy - naptic PRG - 1 and subsequent increased excitatory drive ( Trimbuch et al . 2009 ) in transfected neurons were responsible for the observed reduced axon outgrowth effect . Premature Onset of Excitatory Activity Reduced Axon Outgrowth Via Ca2 + - dependent Signaling It is generally accepted that increased neuronal activity affects gene expression ( Greer and Greenberg 2008 ) . To understand the mechanism coupling increased excitatory activity and decreased axon outgrowth on a molecular level , we investi - gated Ca 2 + - dependent signal transduction that is activated upon neuronal activity ( Wayman et al . 2008 ) . We found a sig - ni ﬁ cant phosphorylation increase of CaMKI , but not of other members of the Ca 2 + / CaM - pathway , which is a critical mol - ecule for axon outgrowth ( Ageta - Ishihara et al . 2009 ) . This is in line with recent data showing that phosphorylation of down - stream targets of neuronal activity like Ca 2 + - signaling mole - cules has to be homoeostatically regulated to assure proper function . Constitutive activation of the CaMKK α leading to hyperphosphorylation of CaMKI ( Kaitsuka et al . 2011 ) or chronic enhancement of CREB activity ( Viosca et al . 2009 ) , a down - stream target of the CaM kinase , both led to impairment of spa - tial memory acquisition . To further understand the downstream Ca 2 + - signaling up to molecules directly modeling the axon ’ s actin cytoskeleton , we analyzed EC - speci ﬁ c phosphorylation levels of LimK1 which is a target of the Ca 2 + / Calmodulin - dependent protein kinases ( Takemura et al . 2009 ; Saito et al . 2013 ) and inactivates co ﬁ lin activity via phosphorylation ( Mizuno 2013 ) . Co ﬁ lin negatively regulates actin dynamics and destabilizes axons via actin depolymerization ( Mizuno 2013 ; Saito et al . 2013 ) . In fact , we could show that both LimK1 / 2 and co ﬁ lin phosphorylation levels were decreased which results in an increased co ﬁ lin activity and a negative effect on axon outgrowth ( Mizuno 2013 ; Saito et al . 2013 ) . However , as reported in other systems ( Pandey et al . 2007 ) , it is well feasible that in parallel to a reduction of LimK1 / 2 - mediated co ﬁ lin phosphorylation , a direct , Ca 2 + - dependent co ﬁ lin dephosphorylation occurs , which results in alterations of axon outgrowth alike . Premature Excitatory Activity Affects Entorhinal – Hippocampal Networks in Adult Animals Since dentate gyrus innervation follows a precise spatio - temporal developmental pattern during the early postnatal period ( Frotscher et al . 2000 ) , our data imply alterations of the proper connectivity between EC and hippocampus . Since underlying mechanisms inducing premature neuronal activity in the EC occur in the postnatal period , other dentate gyrus input systems developing at earlier stages such as the septo - hippocampal projection ( Linke and Frotscher 1993 ) playing an important role for hippocampal function ( Hangya et al . 2009 ; Vandecasteele et al . 2014 ) are supposed to remain unaffected . In sum , our data suggest that synaptic LPA signaling via pre - synaptic LPA 2 - Rs and under physiological control of the post - synaptic PRG - 1 molecule regulates early entorhinal excitatory activity affecting neuronal circuit formation important for memory function in adult animals . Since the early postnatal processes studied here in the mouse brain are equivalent to the development in primates ( Amaral et al . 2014 ) and hippocampus - dependent memory emerges during early child - hood concomitant with the maturation of hippocampal cir - cuits ( Lavenex and Banta Lavenex 2013 ) , our ﬁ ndings imply an important role of proper onset of entorhinal excitatory activity during human brain development involving bioactive lipid sig - naling , and call for caution in affecting this process by any external intervention .
