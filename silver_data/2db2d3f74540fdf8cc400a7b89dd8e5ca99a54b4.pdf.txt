ThedeletionofbothRac1andRac2murineallelesleads to a massive egress of hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells ( HSC / Ps ) into the blood from the marrow , whereas Rac1 – / – but not Rac2 – / – HSC / Ps fail to engraft in the bone marrow of irradiated recipient mice . In contrast , Rac2 , but not Rac1 , regulates super - oxide production and directed migration in neutrophils , and in each cell type , the two GTPases play distinct roles in actin organization , cell survival , and proliferation . Thus , Rac1 and Rac2 regulate unique aspects of hematopoietic development and function . Rho GTPases , members of the Ras superfamily , are critical regulators of cellular function and sig - nal transduction pathways in eukaryotic cells . In mammalian cells , the best - studied members— Rho , Rac , and Cdc42—play distinct roles in reg - ulating actin assembly and motility ( 1 ) . However , the roles of Rho GTPases in hematopoietic cell development and function have only recently be - gun to be elucidated . There are three Rac GT - Pases—Rac1 , Rac2 , and Rac3—and their high degree of homology suggests potential overlap - ping functions ( 2 , 3 ) . Rac1 is ubiquitously ex - pressed , whereas the expression of Rac2 is re - stricted to cells of hematopoietic origin ( 2 , 3 ) and Rac3 is expressed primarily in the brain ( 4 ) . We have previously reported the critical roles of Rac2 in a wide variety of primary hematopoi - etic cells , including the regulation of adhesion , migration , oxidase activity , and gene expression ( 5 – 10 ) . These same functions have been attribut - ed to Rac1 in nonhematopoietic cells in which Rac2 is not expressed ( 11 – 14 ) . However , the roles of Rac1 compared with the roles of Rac2 in blood cells , which express both GTPases , remain to be elucidated . Because homozygous Rac1 - deficient mice die at (cid:5) E8 ( embryonic day 8 ) in utero ( 15 ) , we generated mice with a conditional Rac1 ( flox ) allele ( Rac1 flox / flox ) ( 16 ) ( fig . S1 ) . These were compared with mice that were homozygous for both the Rac1 flox allele and a Rac2 - null allele ( Rac1 flox / flox ; Rac2 – / – ) . Floxed Rac1 sequences were deleted by means of two methods , and the deletion of Rac1 sequences was confirmed with polymerase chain reactions ( PCRs ) and immuno - blots ( figs . S2 and S3 ) ( 17 ) . Most prominently , the absence of Rac1 led to a significant reduction compared with that of the wild type in the ability of hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells ( HSC / Ps ) to reconstitute hema - topoiesis in a non - obese diabetic / severe com - bined - immunodeficiency ( NOD / SCID ) engraft - ment model ( 18 ) ( Fig . 1A ) . Engraftment is a multistep process requiring proliferation and dif - ferentiation of stem cells after the movement of these cells into the bone marrow from the blood and adhesion in the hematopoietic microenviron - ment ( 19 ) . Rac2 – / – cells demonstrated normal short - term engraftment , indicating that defective engraftment was specific for Rac1 deficiency . Although modest movement ( mobilization ) of HSC / Ps out of the marrow cavity into the circu - lating blood was observed in Rac2 – / – mice , as previously reported ( 6 ) , the absence of both Rac1 and Rac2 resulted in a massive mobilization of progenitor colony - forming unit cells ( CFU - C ) into the peripheral circulation ( Fig . 1B ) . These phenotypes occurred despite the normal expres - sion of (cid:6) 1 integrin adhesion molecules ( 20 ) and the normal expression of CXCR4 , the receptor for the stromal - derived factor - 1 ( SDF - 1 ) , both of which have previously been implicated in the engraftment and mobilization of stem cells ( 21 ) ( Fig . 1C ) . However , whereas Rac1 – / – HSC / Ps showed normal adhesion to fibronectin , Rac2 – / – HSC / Ps and , more prominently , Rac1 – / – ; Rac2 – / – cells displayed significantly decreased adhesion to fibronectin ( Fig . 1D ) , strongly suggesting that Rac2 has a predominant but overlapping role with Rac1 in integrin - mediated stem cell adhe - sion . Moreover , mobilization of Rac1 – / – ; Rac2 – / – HSC / Ps was associated with significantly in - creased expression of CXCR4 ( Fig . 1C ) . Rac1 – / – HSC / Ps also displayed impaired growth factor – stimulated in vitro growth , as de - termined by progenitor colony formation ( Fig . 2A and fig . S4 ) and expansion in liquid culture ( fig . S5 ) . Reduced Rac1 – / – HSC / P growth was associ - ated with significantly decreased thymidine incor - poration ( Fig . 2B ) . Rac1 – / – ; Rac2 – / – cells had a more severe reduction in proliferation compared with that of the wild - type and Rac2 – / – cells , and they formed profoundly abnormal colonies with no cellular halo , suggesting combined effects of impaired growth and migration . Indeed , this se - vere phenotype in Rac1 – / – ; Rac2 – / – cells was asso - ciated with reduced proliferation ( Fig . 2B ) , in - creased apoptosis associated with Rac2 deficiency ( Fig . 2C and fig . S6 ) , and profoundly decreased migrationinresponsetoSDF - 1 , ascomparedwith that of wild - type cells ( Fig . 2D ) . To determine the mechanism of reduced HSC / P growth , we undertook additional analysis .

Rac1 – / – but not Rac2 – / – HSC / Ps also showed decreased extracellular signal – regulated kinase ( ERK ) ( p42 / p44 ) phosphorylation ( Fig . 3C ) . We found these defects in cell cycle progression and signaling directly related to Rac1 deficiency , be - cause expression of the Rac1 protein but not the Rac2 protein , induced with retrovirus - mediated gene transfer , restored cycle progression and ERK activation in Rac1 – / – cells ( Fig . 3A and fig .

S9 and S10 ) . In addition , SCF - induced reduction in expression of cyclin - dependent kinase ( Cdk ) inhibitor p27 kip1 was ab - sent in Rac1 – / – cells ( Fig . 3B ) . In contrast , increased apoptosis of Rac2 – / – HSC / Ps was associated with reduced Akt activa - tion compared with that of wild - type cells after SCF stimulation ( Fig . 3D ) . Apoptosis and Akt activation in Rac1 – / – HSC / Ps were similar to those of the wild - type cells . Expression of Rac2 but not Rac1 in Rac2 – / – HSC / Ps by means of retrovirus - mediated gene transfer led to a com - plete reversal of the apoptotic phenotype ( fig . S11 ) . Inhibitor studies in wild - type cells con - firmed the roles of phosphoinositide 3 - kinase and Akt in mediating survival ( fig . S12 ) . Thus , al - though some overlap exists in these pathways , Rac1 predominantly regulates HSC / P cell cycle progression . Defective proliferation in these cells likely contributes to their lack of engraftment in vivo . Rac2 predominantly regulates apoptosis , which likely contributes to the profound defect in growth in vitro seen in Rac1 – / – ; Rac2 – / – HSC / Ps . To further examine the effects of Rac1 and Rac2 on cytoskeleton changes that are impor - tant in engraftment and mobilization , SDF - 1 – induced actin polymerization and cell shape changes were studied . Rac2 – / – but not Rac1 – / – HSC / Ps demonstrated markedly impaired cor - tical F - actin assembly ( Fig . 3E ) ( 22 ) . In timed - lapsed video microscopy images , Rac1 – / – ; Rac2 – / – cells demonstrated significantly re - duced cell spreading and actin - based membrane protrusion and essentially no coordinated mi - gration in response to SDF - 1 . Although Rac1 – / – HSC / Ps showed relatively normal migration in this assay , in some cases , Rac1 deficiency was associated with an apparent delay or defect in the retraction of the uropod trailing the cell ( movie S1 ) . Thus , Rac1 and Rac2 appear to play both unique and overlapping roles in reg - ulating the cytoskeleton , which affects adhesion and mobilization of HSC / Ps from the medullary cavity into the blood circulation . We next studied whether Rac1 and Rac2 play unique roles in the regulation of cytoskel - eton in neutrophils that are derived from HSC / Ps . Consistent with HSC / Ps , agonist - induced assembly of F - actin was distinctly different in Rac1 – / – and Rac2 – / – neutrophils ( Fig . 4A ) . Rac2 – / – , but not Rac1 – / – , neutrophils demon - strated impaired cortical F - actin assembly ( 23 ) . Rac1 – / – and Rac2 – / – neutrophils displayed nor - mal adhesion , but Rac1 – / – cells notably showed increased cell spreading by means of (cid:6) 2 inte - grins compared with that of wild - type cells ( Fig . 4 , B to D ) . Rac2 – / – cells showed decreased cell spreading and Rac1 – / – ; Rac2 – / – neutrophils were comparable in circumference to Rac2 – / – cells but showed decreased adhesion by means of (cid:6) 2 integrins ( Fig . 4D ) . We next examined the functional signifi - cance of these changes in neutrophil actin assem - bly . In contrast to Rac2 – / – neutrophils , which showed impaired chemotaxis ( Fig . 4E ) , no de - fect in migration was observed in Rac1 - deficient neutrophils stimulated with N - formyl - Met - Leu - Phe ( f MLP ) . Rac1 – / – ; Rac2 – / – neutrophils demon - strated markedly reduced migration . Rac1 – / – cells also displayed normal frequency of migra - tion when observed by video microscopy ( movie Fig . 3 . Effect of Rac deﬁciency on cell cycle progression , signaling pathways , and actin polymeriza - tion in HSC / Ps . Wild - type , Rac2 – / – , Rac1 – / – , and Rac1 – / – ; Rac2 – / – HSC / Ps ( lin – , c - kit (cid:9) ) that were generated by in vivo Cre ex - pression ( as in Fig . 2 ) were used for these assays . Similar results were obtained with cells trans - duced in vitro with a Cre - express - ing retrovirus vector . ( A ) Cell cycle progression . Cells were starved and stimulated with SCF ( 100 ng / ml ) . Cycle progression into S and G 2 / M phases was determined by bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) incor - poration 48 hours after SCF stim - ulation , and cell cycle distribution was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry using the antibody to BrdU and 7 - amino actinomycin D staining . Error bars show the mean (cid:2) SD ; n (cid:4) 3 . For genetic restoration studies , Rac1 – / – and Rac2 – / – HSC / Ps were transduced with a retrovirus , MIEG3 – hemagglutinin antigen ( HA ) – Rac2 ( expressingwild - typeRac2 ) orMIEG3 - HA - Rac1 ( expressingwild - typeRac1 ) . Two days after transduction , EGFP (cid:9) and c - Kit (cid:9) cells were isolated by a ﬂuorescence - activated cell sorter and used for cell cycle analysis . ( B to D ) Immunoblot analyses . HSC / Ps of each genotype were starved as above and stimulated with SCF ( 100 ng / ml ) at the time points indicated . Cell lysates were prepared for immunoblot analyses using antibodies speciﬁc for ( B ) cyclin D1 , p27 kip1 , and p21 cip1 , ( C ) phospho - p42 / p44 , and ( D ) phospho - Akt . Membranes were then stripped and blotted with antibodies for ( B ) (cid:6) - actin , ( C ) total p42 / p44 , and ( D ) total Akt as loading controls . ( E ) F - actin subcellular localization . HSC / Ps were serum - depleted in Hanks’ balanced salt solution and stimulated with the che - mokine , SDF - 1 ( 100 ng / ml ) , for 30 s before they were ﬁxed with 2 % parafor - maldehyde . Cells were stained with rhodamine - labeled phalloidin on chamber slides . Fluorescence images were acquired on a Leica microscope equipped with a deconvolution system driven by OpenLab software ( 31 ) . Images shown are representatives of more than 100 cells examined for each genotype . The results shown in each panel are representatives of three independent experiments .

However , as seen in HSC / Ps , Rac1 defi - ciency was also accompanied by an abnormal retraction of the uropod in some migrating neutrophils , suggesting a subtle defect in F - actin polymerization ( 24 ) . Rac2 – / – neutrophils and , more prominently , Rac1 – / – ; Rac2 – / – neu - trophils showed defects in cell polarization and migration . Both Rac1 and Rac2 have been demonstrated to be essential for oxidase activity of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phos - phate ( NADPH ) in cell free assays ( 25 , 26 ) . How - ever , after stimulation with f MLP , the percentage of nitro blue tetrazolium ( NBT (cid:9) ) cells , a measure of oxidase activity , was identical in Rac1 – / – neu - trophils and wild - type cells ( Fig . 4F ) . Rac2 - deficient neutrophils displayed (cid:5) 60 % reduction in the number of NBT (cid:9) neutrophils compared with that in wild - type cells . Deficiency of both Rac1 and Rac2 was associated with a higher reduction in the percentage of NBT (cid:9) cells com - pared with that of Rac2 – / – cells ( Fig . 4F ) . We next determined whether , in a manner similar to HSC / Ps , Rac proteins regulated ERK activation in neutrophils . A reduction in f MLP - induced ERK phosphorylation was seen in both Rac1 – / – and Rac2 – / – cells , but this reduction was reproducibly more pronounced in Rac2 – / – neutro - phils ( Fig . 4G ) . Rac1 – / – ; Rac2 – / – neutrophils dem - onstrated severely reduced ERK phosphorylation . In wild - type neutrophils’ cortical F - actin assem - bly , cell migration but not superoxide production was inhibited in the presence of the Mek ( ERK kinase ) inhibitor U0126 ( figs . S13 to S16 ) . Thus , Rac2 appears to be a physiologically critical Rac GTPase in neutrophil migration and NADPH ox - idase function , whereas Rac1 plays a role in con - trolling cell spreading . Adhesion and migration of cells within the hematopoietic microenvironment are critical for blood formation and blood cell function ( 27 ) . We show here that the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Rac2 are key regulators of these functions in hemato - poietic cells . Despite the high degree of sequence identity , each GTPase plays unique physiological roles , particularly with respect to cell growth , sur - vival signaling pathways , and distinct actin struc - turesthatmediatedifferentcytoskeletonfunctions . Given that each Rac protein contains identical sequences mediating known effector interactions , the basis for the specificity of these functions is still to be determined . We propose that these differences likely reside in the subcellular local - ization of each protein ( 28 ) . References and Notes 1 . A . Hall , Science 279 , 509 ( 1998 ) . 2 . J . Moll , G .

Considerable F - actin polymerization at the cell pe - riphery was seen in wild - type and Rac1 – / – HSC / Ps stimulated with 100 ng / ml of SDF - 1 . In contrast , F - actin polymerization at the cell periphery was not detectable in Rac2 – / – and Rac1 – / – ; Rac2 – / – HSC / Ps . Indeed , in the absence of both GTPases , no obvious F - actin was seen on immunoﬂuorescence images , and the cytoplasm of these cells appeared to collapse toward the cell nucleus . 23 . The well - deﬁned rim of cortical actin present at the cell periphery of wild - type cells completely disappeared in Rac2 – / – cellsbutremainedclearlyvisiblein Rac1 – / – cells . In Rac1 – / – ; Rac2 – / – neutrophils , the F - actin structure ap - peared to collapse into a dense network immediately surrounding the nucleus , showing a complete loss of structural organization consistent with a lack of cell spreading ( Fig . 4B ) . Whereas previous reports demon - strate an important role for Rac1 in F - actin assembly in many cells , most of these studies were done in nonhe - matopoietic cells , which do not express Rac2 . 24 .

Greenblatt , 4 Mark Gerstein 1 , 3 † We have developed an approach using Bayesian networks to predict protein - protein interactions genome - wide in yeast . Our method naturally weights and combines into reliable predictions genomic features only weakly associated with interaction ( e . g . , messenger RNA coexpression , coessentiality , and colo - calization ) . In addition to de novo predictions , it can integrate often noisy , experimental interaction data sets . We observe that at given levels of sensi - tivity , our predictions are more accurate than the existing high - throughput experimental data sets . We validate our predictions with TAP ( tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation ) tagging experiments . Our analysis , which gives a comprehensive view of yeast interactions , is available at genecensus . org / intint . Many fundamental biological processes in - volve protein - protein interactions , and comprehensively identifying them is im - portant to systematically defining their cel - lular role . New experimental and computa - tional methods have vastly increased the number of known or putative interactions , cataloged in databases ( 1 – 7 ) . Much genom - ic information also relates to interactions indirectly : Interacting proteins are often significantly coexpressed ( as shown by mi - croarrays ) and colocalized to the same sub - cellular compartment ( 8 , 9 ) . Unfortunately , interaction data sets are of - ten incomplete and contradictory ( 10 – 12 ) . In the context of genome - wide analyses , these inaccuracies are greatly magnified because the protein pairs that do not interact ( nega - tives ) far outnumber those that do ( positives ) . For instance , in yeast , the (cid:5) 6000 proteins allow for (cid:5) 18 million potential interactions , but the estimated number of actual interac - tions is (cid:1) 100 , 000 ( 10 , 13 , 14 ) . Thus , even reliable techniques can generate many false positives when applied genome - wide . This is similar to a diagnostic with a 1 % false - positive rate for a rare disease occurring in 0 . 1 % of the population , which would roughly produce one true positive for every 10 false ones . Further information is necessary . Consequently , when evaluating protein - protein interactions , one needs to integrate evi - dence from many different sources ( 15 – 17 ) . Here , we propose a Bayesian approach for inte - grating interaction information that allows for the probabilistic combination of multiple data sets and demonstrate its application to yeast ( 18 ) . Our approach can be used for combining noisy inter - action data sets and for predicting interactions de novo , from other genomic information . The basic idea is to assess each source of evidence for interactions by comparing it against samples of known positives and negatives ( “gold - stan - dards” ) , yielding a statistical reliability . Then , extrapolating genome - wide , we predict the chance of possible interactions for every protein pair by combining each independent evidence source according to its reliability . We verified our predictions by comparing them against existing experimental interaction data ( not in the gold - standard ) as well as new TAP ( tandem affinity purification ) tagging experiments . Among the many possible machine - learning approaches that could be applied to predicting interactions ( ranging from simple unions and intersections of data sets to neural networks , decision trees , and support - vector machines ) , Bayesian networks have several advantages ( 19 ) : They allow for combining highly dissimilar types of data ( i . e . , numeri - cal and categorical ) , converting them to a common probabilistic framework , without unnecessary simplification ; they readily ac - commodate missing data ; and they naturally weight each information source according to its reliability . In contrast to “black - box” predictors , Bayesian networks are readily interpretable as they represent conditional probability relation - ships among information sources . The gold - standard data set on which we train ( “parameterize” ) the Bayesian network should ideally be ( i ) independent from the data sources serving as evidence , ( ii ) sufficiently large for reliable statistics , and ( iii ) free of systematic bias . We used the MIPS ( Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences ) complexes catalog as the gold - standard for pos - itives ( 6 ) .
