Structural Comparison Between MHC Classes I and II ; in Evolution , a Class - II - Like Molecule Probably Came First Yanan Wu 1 † , Nianzhi Zhang 1 † , Keiichiro Hashimoto 2 , Chun Xia 1 * and Johannes M . Dijkstra 2 * 1 Department of Microbiology and Immunology , College of Veterinary Medicine , China Agricultural University , Beijing , China , 2 Institute for Comprehensive Medical Science , Fujita Health University , Toyoake , Japan Structures of peptide - loaded major histocompatibility complex class I ( pMHC - I ) and class II ( pMHC - II ) complexes are similar . However , whereas pMHC - II complexes include similar - sized II a and II b chains , pMHC - I complexes include a heavy chain ( HC ) and a single domain molecule b 2 - microglobulin ( b 2 - m ) . Recently , we elucidated several pMHC - I and pMHC - II structures of primitive vertebrate species . In the present study , a comprehensive comparison of pMHC - I and pMHC - II structures helps to understand pMHC structural evolution and supports the earlier proposed — though debated — direction of MHC evolution from class II - type to class I . Extant pMHC - II structures share major functional characteristics with a deduced MHC - II - type homodimer ancestor . Evolutionary establishment of pMHC - I presumably involved important new functions such as ( i ) increased peptide selectivity by binding the peptides in a closed groove ( ii ) , structural ampli ﬁ cation of peptide ligand sequence differences by binding in a non - relaxed fashion , and ( iii ) increased peptide selectivity by syngeneic heterotrimer complex formation between peptide , HC , and b 2 - m . These new functions were associated with structures that since their establishment in early pMHC - I have been very well conserved , including a shifted and reorganized P1 pocket ( aka A pocket ) , and insertion of a b 2 - m hydrophobic knob into the peptide binding domain b - sheet ﬂ oor . A comparison between divergent species indicates better sequence conservation of peptide binding domains among MHC - I than among MHC - II , agreeing with more demanding interactions within pMHC - I complexes . In lung ﬁ shes , genes encoding fusions of all MHC - II a and MHC - II b extracellular domains were identi ﬁ ed , and although these lung ﬁ sh genes presumably derived from classical MHC - II , they provide an alternative mechanistic hypothesis for how evolution from class II - type to class I may have occurred .

MHC class I ( MHC - I ) is expressed by most nucleated cell types and important for presentation of peptides from intracellular antigens to CD8 + cytotoxic T cells , which can kill the presenting cell in case of infection or cancerous mutations . MHC - II is expressed by professional antigen presenting cells and important for presentation of peptide fragments from digested endocytosed / phagocytosed antigens to CD4 + T cells , which help to decide on how to proceed with a possible immune response . Bjorkman et al . ( 3 , 4 ) and Brown et al . ( 5 ) were the ﬁ rst to determine the structures of the ectodomains of pMHC - I and pMHC - II , respectively , namely of human pHLA - A2 and pHLA - DR1 . The similarity between MHC - I and MHC - II , already evident from the sequences ( 6 ) , was even more impressively observed in the structures ( 5 ) . The ectodomain structures formed by both MHC classes consist of two membrane - distal domains which each constitute a similar half of a pseudo - symmetric unit consisting of a curved b - sheet topped by two antiparallel a - helix structures which leave a groove in between , and two membrane - proximal domains of the immunoglobulin superfamily ( IgSF ) C1 set . In MHC - I structures , a heavy chain ( HC ) comprising the two membrane - distal domains ( I - a 1 and I - a 2 ) , a membrane - proximal IgSF domain ( I - a 3 ) , and a connecting peptide / transmembrane / cytoplasmic tail ( CP / TM / CY ) region , binds a free single IgSF domain molecule , b 2 - microglobulin ( b 2 - m ) . On the other hand , MHC - II structures consist of two similarly sized molecules , the II a and II b chains , which each possess a membrane - distal domain ( II - a 1 or II - b 1 ) , a membrane - proximal IgSF domain ( II - a 2 or II - b 2 ) , and a CP / TM / CY region . MHC - I molecules , within the groove — formed by their membrane - distal domains — which is closed at both ends , typically bind peptides of 8 - 11 amino acids ( aa ) , most commonly of 9 aa , whereas MHC - II molecules typically bind peptides of 12 - 25 aa that extend beyond the ends of their open groove ( 7 – 9 ) . The above described structures and functions concern “ classical ” MHC - I and MHC - II and they are — except a few cases that represent gene losses [ e . g ( 10 , 11 ) ] — found throughout jawed vertebrate species . The wide distribution and their conservation of ancestral traits suggest that these classical types are the evolutionary oldest types among known extant MHC - I and MHC - II types ( 12 – 15 ) . However , at various times during evolution , classical MHC - I and MHC - II genes were duplicated and modi ﬁ ed for encoding “ nonclassical ” MHC molecules which exhibit diverged features , a diversity of functions , and a more restricted distribution among species ( 12 – 18 ) . In the present article , if not speci ﬁ ed , “ MHC - I ” and “ MHC - II ” refer to the classical type molecules , with MHC - I referring to both HC and b 2 - m , and MHC - II referring to both MHC - II a and MHC - II b . In jawless ﬁ sh and invertebrates , MHC genes or MHC - homologous genes have not been found , and MHC features as well as the distinctions between MHC - I and MHC - II probably were established during the early evolution of jawed vertebrates ( 19 ) . The ﬁ rst MHC molecule in evolution probably was a homodimer with class II - like features , as postulated by Kaufman et al . ( 20 ) based on sequence comparisons [ see also ( 6 ) ] and considerations of parsimony . The model was further explored and supported in later studies [ e . g . , ( 21 – 23 ) ] . In the model , after geneduplicationanddifferentiation , thehomodimerevolvedintoa class II - type heterodimer molecule that was ancestral to both extant MHC - I and MHC - II [ Figure 1 , the model shown here is essentially as proposed by Kaufman et al . ( 20 , 21 ) ] . The generation of MHC - I genes HC and b 2 - m from MHC - II - type genes involved exon shuf ﬂ ing events ( Figure 1 ) . The model implies that the I - a 1 + b 2 - m and II - a 1 + II - a 2 domain sequences form a phylogenetic lineage , in the present study called the “ a ” lineage , while the I - a 2 + I - a 3 and II - b 1 + II - b 2 sequences form the “ b ” lineage ( Figure 1 ) . The model is consistent with sequence - based computerized phylogenetic tree analyses ( 22 , 24 ) and with structural analysis of pMHC - I and pMHC - II complexes ( 4 , 5 ) . The present article refers to this model of MHC class evolution as the “ II - to - I ” model . Some scientists do not subscribe to this model and proposed that MHC - I organization came before MHC - II organization ( 25 , 26 ) , but such I - to - II model cannot explain the close phylogenetic relatedness between the I - a 1 / II - a 1 and I - a 2 / II - b 1 sequences and between the b 2 - m / II - a 2 and I - a 3 / II - b 2 sequences . Structures of pMHC - I have now been determined throughout the major clades of jawed vertebrates including cartilaginous ﬁ sh ( 27 ) , bony ﬁ sh ( 28 , 29 ) , amphibians ( 30 ) , the birds chicken [ e . g . , ( 31 – 33 ) ] and duck ( 34 ) , and a variety of mammals [ e . g . , ( 4 , 35 – 38 ) ] , whereas pMHC - II structures only have been determined for chicken ( 39 ) , mouse [ e . g . , ( 40 ) ] , and human [ e . g . , ( 5 ) ] ; most of the here listed studies in primitive vertebrates were performed by our group . This recent accumulation of MHC structural information across widely divergent species invites a deeper analysis of MHC evolution . Here , we present a comprehensive analysis of MHC sequences and structures , and a deduction of major evolutionary developments within the course of pMHC structural evolution . Our study supports the II - to - I model and is the ﬁ rst to analyze pMHC structural evolution beyond the issue of covalent domain organization . It concludes that pMHC - II structures share important similarities with the deduced ancestral MHC homodimer , whereas pMHC - I structures acquired a signi ﬁ cantly new peptide binding mode in which b 2 - m plays a pivotal role . MATERIALS AND METHODS Alignment of MHC Sequences and Phylogenetic Tree Analysis The sequence alignment between various MHC - I and MHC - II sequences was made with the intention to , as good as possible , align evolutionarily corresponding residues . MHC sequences and structures were retrieved from databases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ; https : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / ) . Representative MHC sequences were aligned by hand [ see also ( 12 – 14 , 41 ) ] based on similarities between sequences , considerations of likely evolutionary events , and structural comparisons of various pMHC - I and pMHC - II ( Supplementary File 1B ) . For most parts of the b - strands and helices the alignments are unambiguous , but in many of the loop regions , and in some b - strand and helical regions with insertions or deletions , the best possible alignment is uncertain . That superimposing of structures does not provide de ﬁ nite clues for Wu et al . Structural Evolution of MHC Classes Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 621153 2 all parts of the alignment can be seen in Supplementary File 1B . Secondary structures as indicated in the sequence alignment ﬁ gures were determined by DSSP software [ https : / / swift . cmbi . umcn . nl / gv / dssp / ( 42 ) ] . Leader sequences were predicted using SignalP software [ http : / / www . cbs . dtu . dk / services / SignalP / ( 43 ) ] . For alignment of lung ﬁ sh MHC - IIabSol sequences only , we used CLUSTAL 2 . 1 software ( https : / / www . genome . jp / tools - bin / clustalw ) . For phylogenetic tree analysis of lung ﬁ sh MHC - IIabSol and classical MHC - II sequences the neighbor joining method was applied using MEGA7 software ( 44 ) . Calculations and Generation of Illustrations Peptide - contacting residues were identi ﬁ ed using the program CONTACT and were de ﬁ ned as residues containing an atom within 4 . 0 Å of the target partner ( 45 ) . Structural illustrations and the electron density - related ﬁ gures were generated using the PyMOL molecular graphics system ( http : / / www . pymol . org / ) , and the same software system was used for making structural superposition ﬁ gures by using the program “ super ” and to calculate dihedral angles of the pep56 backbone using the program “ Measurement - Dihedrals ” . PDBePISA software [ http : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / msd - srv / prot _ int / cgi - bin / piserver ( 46 ) ] was used for interdomain contact analysis and for measuring the exposed surface areas ( = Accessible Surface Area minus Buried Surface Area ) of the peptide ligands .

( 20 , 21 ) . In the model , MHC - I ( HC + b 2 - m ) and MHC - II ( II a + II b ) gene sets were derived from an ancestral MHC - II - like gene that encoded a homodimer - forming molecule with a peptide binding domain ( p ) and an IgSF domain ( i ) . The ancestral gene duplicated , followed by differentiation into lineages “ a ” ( with domains pa and ia ) and “ b ” ( with domains pb and ib ) that together encoded a heterodimeric structure . After this , an exon shuf ﬂ ing event involving translocation of the pa domain exon was part of the creation of the MHC - I genes HC and b 2 - m . Wu et al .

Ampli ﬁ cation and Sequencing of MHC - IIabSol for Slender Lung ﬁ sh ( Protopterus dolloi ) A slender lung ﬁ sh ( Protopterus dolloi ) was obtained from Meitosuien Co . Ltd . ( Nagakute , Aichi , Japan ) . The animal was handled according to the Guidelines for the Management of Laboratory Animals in Fujita Health University . Total RNA was isolated from kidney by use of “ TRIzol ” ( Gibco ) following the instructions of the manufacturer , except that the protocol was repeated for additional removal of DNA and proteins . SuperScript III reverse transcriptase kit ( Invitrogen ) with random hexamer primers was used for the construction of cDNA . PCR was conducted using ExTaq DNA polymerase ( Takara ) with 40 PCR cycles and primers MHC - IIabSol - F , 5 ’ - AGAACCGTTTGGCACTGGGATC , and MHC - IIabSol - R , 5 ’ - TTCTGAAGCACATCAGTAATACTGCCTG . The ampli ﬁ ed fragment was inserted into plasmid vector , followed by transformation to E . coli , and sequence analysis of multiple clones ( to minimize the chance of PCR or sequencing artefacts ) by using BigDye Terminator v3 . 1 Sequencing Standard kit ( Applied Biosystems ) and 3100Avant / 3130xl Genetic Analyzer ( Applied Biosystems Life Technologies , Foster City , CA , USA ) . The puri ﬁ ed MHC - IIabSol sequence was con ﬁ rmed by its identity with SRA reports , and was deposited to GenBank as accession MT909553 . RESULTS Overall pMHC - I and pMHC - II Structures , and Introduction of a Nomenclature for Similar Domains A comparison of ﬁ ve and three representative pMHC - I and MHC - II structures , respectively , of different species , reveals an overall similarity in organization ( Figure 2A ) . Their most readily observed distinctionisthecon ﬁ nementofthepeptidewithinaclosedgroovein the case of pMHC - I ( 4 , 5 ) . For the phylogeny of the species whose pMHCstructuresareshownin Figure2A , see Figure2B . Asreported previously [ e . g . , ( 19 ) ] , the absence of MHC genes in jawless vertebrates and invertebrates , combined with the presence of classical MHC - I and classical MHC - II in all extant classes of jawed vertebrates , concludesarelativelyrapidemergenceanddifferentiation of MHC molecules early in jawed vertebrate evolution ( Figure 2B ) . To allow convenient comparisons between similar type domains of pMHC - I and pMHC - II structures , we introduced a nomenclature denoting I - a 1 and II - a 1 as “ pa ” domains ( MHC peptide binding domain a ) , I - a 2 and II - b 1 as “ pb ” domains , b 2 - m and II - a 2 as “ ia ” domains ( MHCIgSFdomaina ) , andI - a 3andII - b 2as “ ib ” domains , respectively ( Figures 1 , 2A ) . The combination of a pa and a pb domain , commonly referred to as the peptide binding domain or PBD — which would be a confusing term in the present study — is denoted as “ pab ” domain . Residue numbering in the present study followsthesequencealignmentsin Figure3 and SupplementaryFile 1A , and is based on the residue numbering by Saper et al . ( 49 ) for HLA - A2 a 1 domain and human b 2 - m . Sequence Comparison of MHC - I and MHC - II Molecules Sequence similarities are readily found between MHC - I and MHC - II , and also between the pa and pb domains , and between the ia and ib domains ( Figure 3 and Supplementary File 1A ) . Some sequence features are well conserved in both MHC - I and MHC - II , while others are characteristic for either class . A relatively large set of residues are characteristic for MHC - I . The sequences of the representative pMHC - I and pMHC - II structures compared in Figure 2A are aligned per domain - type in Figure 3 with indications of their secondary structures . In Supplementary File 1A , additional representative MHC sequences throughout jawed vertebrates are compared . Most parts of the sequence alignments readily agree with structural superimpositions ( Supplementary File 1B ) , but in some highly variable — mostly loop — regions , the best possible alignments are not certain . The Figure 3 and Supplementary File 1A sequence alignments show that , arguably , the most dramatic consistent difference between the MHC - I and MHC - II sequences maps to the N - terminal part of the pa - domain helical region , where II - a 1 domains exhibit deletions of a few residues compared to the MHC p - domain consensus situation ( 5 ) . Moreover , compared to I - a 2 and II - b 1 , the I - a 1 sequences have insertions of one or few residues around position p55 plus , in most cases , deletions of a few residues around position p62b , which are coincident with the presence and absence of helix interruptions ( kinks ) , respectively . Among the l - a 3 domain sequences , length variation is observed in the S1S2 - loop regions , and , in teleost ﬁ sh , in the C - terminal regions [ Supplementary File 1A ( b ) and see also ( 51 ) ] . The color shadings of residues in Figure 3 and Supplementary File 1A are based on , partially subjective , comparisons of sequences , and help to estimate when in evolution certain residues or “ residue - types ” were established or ﬁ xated . “ Residue - types , ” here , refers to the sets of residues indicated above the alignment , which were chosen based on observed MHC sequence conservation patterns [ see also ( 12 – 14 ) ] , and on similarities between amino acids . In Figure 3 , residues or residue - types that , by deduction , were probably present at the respective position in the assumed ancestral homodimer , are shaded black . Residues or residue - types that probably were present in early members of , and are characteristic for , the a lineage ( I - a 1 + b 2 - m / II a ) and the b lineage ( I - a 2 + I - a 3 / II b ) , are shaded dark blue and dark purple , respectively . Residues or residue - types that are characteristic for the I - a 1 + b 2 - m , II a , I - a 2 + I - a 3 , and II b lineages are shaded light blue , blue , pink , and purple , respectively . In Supplementary File 1A ( b ) , also some IgSF C1 set sequences of non - MHC molecules are compared , which shows that the IgSF residues shaded black in Figure 3 are common among IgSF C1 sequences . However , the tryptophan at position 95 is quite characteristic for MHC , and is shaded red . Wu et al . Structural Evolution of MHC Classes Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 621153 4 Importantly , Figure 3A and Supplementary File 1A ( a ) show that the MHC - I pa and pb domain sequences show many more speci ﬁ cally conserved residues than found in MHC - II . This is re ﬂ ected in the overall similarity levels per domain if comparing across wide species borders , as summarized for a set of representative sequences in Supplementary File 1C . For example , nurse shark UAA * 01 and b 2 - m compared with human HLA - A2 and b 2 - m show the following percentages of aa identities per domain ( alignment as in Figure 3 ) : pa , 45 % ; pb , 38 % ; ia , 40 % ; ib , 27 % , whereas between nurse shark MHC - II ( the II a and II b sequences shown in Supplementary File 1A ) and HLA - DR1 the identity percentages are : pa , 31 % ; pb , 21 % ; ia , 44 % ; ib , 44 % ( Supplementary File 1C ) . As for variation among MHC - I sequences , the better conservation across wide species borders of I - a 1 , I - a 2 , and b 2 - m compared to I - a 3 sequences ( Supplementary File 1C ) was already noticed by Kaufman et al . ( 52 ) . Furthermore , the lower levels of similarity among I - a 3 domain sequences compared to among b 2 - m , II - a 2 and II - b 2 domain sequences ( Supplementary File 1C ) was also re ﬂ ected in published phylogenetic tree analysis results [ e . g . , ( 53 ) ] . The relatively poor conservation of I - a 3 sequences probably is related to this domain participating in only few interdomain interactions and an apparent absence of stringent evolutionary pressure to conserve MHC - IgSF - typical intradomain features ( see below ) . Comparison Between pMHC - I and pMHC - II Structures Similarity in Overall Domain Organization but With Differences in ib Domain Orientations Structures of pMHC - I and pMHC - II are very similar ( Figure 2A ) ( 5 ) . Apart from the peptide lengths , the biggest differences in their overall structures are the orientations of the ib domains ( I - a 3 versus II - b 2 ; Figure 4 ) ( 5 ) . The orientations of ib domains do not only differ between pMHC - I and pMHC - II , but also among pMHC - Is ( 28 , 31 ) and among pMHC - IIs ( 54 ) ( Figure 4B ) . Compared to a 3 domains in mammalian pMHC - Is , the orientations of a 3 domains in pMHC - Is of primitive jawed vertebrates are more similar to the orientations of b 2 domains in pMHC - IIs [ Figures 4A ( c , d ) and 4B ] and they overlap with the outer range of reported II - b 2 orientations ( Figure 4B ) , suggesting that they represent the more primitive orientation of I - a 3 domains . The pb Domain Helices Are Similarly Organized in pMHC - I and pMHC - II , and May Represent the Ancestral Helix Organization To follow the curve of the b - sheet , both in pMHC - I and pMHC - II , and both in the pa and the pb domains , the a - helical regions are divided into parts separated by “ kinks ” ( 4 , 5 ) . The parts A B FIGURE 2 | ( A ) Representative pMHC - I and pMHC - II structures of different species . PDB accession numbers are between brackets .

( B ) Cladogram showing the phylogeny of the species shown in ( A ) ( 47 , 48 ) . Because in Agnatha no MHC genes are found and all classes of Gnathostomata possess both classical MHC - I and MHC - II , it can be assumed that MHC genes emerged and differentiated into classical MHC - I and MHC - II in the period highlighted by the blue bar . MYA , million years ago . Wu et al . Structural Evolution of MHC Classes Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 621153 5 separated by kinks are commonly named H1 and H2 in the case of the pa domains , and H1 , H2a , H2b , and H3 in the case of the pb domains ( Figures 3A , 5A , B ) ( 49 , 50 ) . The pb domain H1 helices are longer than those in the pa domains ( Figure 3A ) , and run parallel to , and above , the pb domain b - strands S3 and S4 ( Figure 5A ) . After a big kink ( “ elbow ” ) , this is followed by a long pb H2 helix that because of a small kink can be divided into H2a and H2b parts [ Figures 5A , B ( a ) ] . In pMHC - I pb , the H2b helix continues longer than in pMHC - II pb , and at the MHC - I - speci ﬁ c residue pbG85 the strand bends in a rather straight angle to continue as a small helix named H3 [ Figure 5B ( a ) ] . In pMHC - II pb , in the absence of pbG85 and having a few residues less to span the same distance as in pMHC - I , the H2b helix structure stops earlier and continues in a more tightly wound H3 helix without a - helix characteristics [ Figure 5B ( a ) ] ( 5 , 50 ) ; consequently , in pMHC - II there is no sharp H2 - H3 angle [ Figure 5B ( a ) ] . Compared to pMHC - II , the pbC11 - pbC74 cysteine bridge is pushed slightly upwards in pMHC - I , causing a slight rotational change in the pb H2b helix that results in a more upward orientation of pbW77 in pMHC - I compared to the pbN77 orientation in pMHC - II that presumably represents the ancestral situation [ Figure 5B ( a ) , - ( c ) , and - ( d ) ; see also below ] .

Residues that are within 4 . 0 Å distance of the peptide ligand are red underlined .

Structural Evolution of MHC Classes Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 621153 8 pMHC - I is accompanied by the evolutionary acquisition / ﬁ xation of pbG10 and a disruption of the regular b - sheet folding in the pb9 - pb11 stretch , whereas regular folding is found at corresponding positions in pMHC - II pb and in the pMHC - I and pMHC - II pa domains [ Figure 5B ( c ) and Supplementary File 1B ( a ) ] . The pbG10 - dependent b - sheet irregularity resulting in different positions / orientations of the pbC11 - pbC74 pair and the pb H2b helix region had been noted before in a classical MHC - I versus MIC - A ( nonclassical MHC - I ) comparison context ( 55 ) , but , as far as we know , not in a I - versus - II context . We assume that , in evolution , the ancestral MHC homodimer had a H1 - H2a - H2b helix organization similar to that in MHC - II b 1 domain , because : ( i ) a similar organization is found in MHC - I a 2 domain [ Figures 5A , B ( a ) ] ; ( ii ) the conservative nature of the MHC - I and MHC - II pb helices is suggested by their conservation of the ancestral pC11 - pC74 cysteine bridge [ Figure 5B ( c ) and Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] ; and , ( iii ) MHC - II b 1 helices can bind the peptide ligand orientated in either N - to - C or C - to - N direction using their ancestral pW60 and pN77 residues ( see below ) ( 56 ) . The pa Domain Helices of pMHC - I and pMHC - II Differ From Each Other and From the Presumed Ancestral Situation If , as we assume , the helix organization in the ancestral MHC homodimer was similar to that in extant pMHC - II pb indeed , the shared evolution of MHC - I and MHC - II pa domains probably involved the reorientation of the H1 helix from being parallel as in the pb domains to being rather perpendicular to the b - sheet as in the pa domains ( Figure 5A ) . However , the MHC - I and MHC - II pa domain helix organizations also differ from each other . In I - a 1 domains , compared to MHC pb domain helix organization , seemingly , insertions of residues around position p55 and deletions around position p62b deleted the H2a - H2b kink and repositioned the H1 - H2 kink , and herewith shortened the H1 helix and lengthened the H2 helix [ Figures 3A , 5B ( d ) , Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] ; this reorganization resulted in partial rotation of the helical stretch including residues p59 and p60 , so that in pMHC - I paY59 now points to the bottom of the groove ( see below ) and pMHC - I paW60 no longer is part of the groove but only connects the helix to the b - sheet [ Figures 5B ( b ) and - ( d ) , and see below ] . Compared to I - a 1 , in II - a 1 domains the H1 - H2 elbow region was shortened by deletion of a few residues and the helices partially melted ( 5 ) , while ancestral paW60 was lost [ Figures 3A , 5B ( b ) and - ( d ) , Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] ; given the diverged sequences of this MHC - II pa stretch , it can ’ t be determined with certainty at which precise positions the residues were deleted . Sequence comparisons suggest that the helix organization of II - a 1 found in mammals and chicken is common throughout MHC - II in jawed vertebrates , although the ancestral paC11 - paC74 cysteine pair that was independently lost in tetrapods and Elasmonbranchii ( sharks / rays ) has been retained in other clades of jawed vertebrates [ Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] . The losses in several clades of FIGURE 5 | The structure of the pab domains . ( A ) Structural organization of the pMHC - I and pMHC - II pab domains , shown from underneath with indications of pa and pb domains ( yellow and green ) , b - strands ( S1 - to - S4 ; PyMOL software does not recognize the shark pUAA a 1 domain S4 strand whereas DSSP software does , see Figure 3A ) , a - helices ( H1 - to - H3 ) , peptide ligand ( red ) , and peptide ligand P1 and P9 / W C a atoms ( blue spheres ) . ( B ) Comparison of pMHC - I and pMHC - II pab domain helices . ( B a , B b ) show superpositions of pb and pa domain helical structures , respectively , from different angles , of shark pUAA , pHLA - A2 , and pHLA - DR1 , based on superimposing of the pab domains , and ( B d ) shows a superposition of the helical regions of both the pa and pb domains of shark pUAA and pHLA - DR1 , based on superimposing of their position 1 - 82 stretches . In the ( B a , B b , B d ) ﬁ gures , the numbers 1 - to - 7 refer to : ( 1 ) The H1 helix regions of mammalian I - a 1 compared to I - a 1 in more primitive species lost a residue [ Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] and this seems to be compensated for by having a 3 10 - helix structure in mammalian I - a 1 H1 helix rather than a ( more loosely winding ) a - helix structure as found for some pMHC - I of primitive animals [ Figures 3A and 5B ( b ) , although frog pUAA also has a 3 10 - helix at this position ] ( 27 ) ; ( 2 ) Compared to the other classes of p domain , in II - a 1 a few helical turns were replaced by a stretch of extended chain ( 5 ) ; ( 3 ) In I - a 2 and II - b 1 , ancestral pW60 is part of the H1 helix and its sidechain points sideways into the groove ; in I - a 1 , pW60 became part of the long H2 helix and points downwards to the b - sheet ; in II - a 1 sequences pW60 was lost [ Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] ; ( 4 ) In I - a 1 , II - a 1 , and II - b 1 , p77 residues have the ability to form hydrogen bonds with the peptide ligand backbone ( see Figures 6B , C ) and are situated at the middle height of the groove , whereas in I - a 2 the ancestral p ( D / N ) 77 residue has been replaced by a tryptophan starting at a higher position and blocking the groove [ see also Figures 6F , G ) . The higher helix position of I - a 2 p77 is caused by an uplifting of the pbC11 - pbC74 disul ﬁ de pair caused by an absence of typical b - strand folding at the pbG10 position ( B c ) ; in ( B c ) , to help readers with orientation , small spheres indicate the C a of positions that are indicated with boxes ; ( 5 ) The pb domain H1 - H2 elbow organization is similar in shark pUAA and pHLA - DR1 , and different from pHLA - A2 , consistent with the number of residues in this region [ Figure 3A and Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] , but a possible functional impact is not known [ see also ( 30 ) ] . ( 6 ) The I - a 2 domains have a steeply downwards running H3 a - helix , but the II - b 1 sequences have fewer residues in this region [ Figure 3A and Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] and breach the same distance by a less steeply orientated and less tightly wound spiraling structure . The No . 6 indicator in ( B a ) points at pMHC - I pbG85 , at the border between pMHC - I pb helices H2b and H3 ; ( 7 ) The kink regions between helices H1 and H2 of the pb ( I - a 2 and II - b 1 ) domains are at a higher point relative to the b - sheet than the corresponding regions in the pa ( I - a 1 and II - a 1 ) domains . ( B e ) The differences between pMHC - I and pMHC - II in pa87 orientation are shown in a superposition of shark pUAA , pHLA - A2 , and pHLA - DR1 pab domains with highlighting the pa86 , pa87 , and pa88 sidechains in sticks format ; the shark pUAA and pHLA - A2 paQ87 sidechains and C a atoms are additionally highlighted in transparent spheres format to show how they , different from pHLA - DR1 paY87 , may be responsible for uplifting the end of the pa domain H2 helix . ( C ) The p33p34 b - bulges and the S2 - S3 clefts in the pab b - sheet . In ( C a - i , ii ) , ( C c - i , ii ) , respectively , shark pUAA and pHLA - DR1 pab domain b - sheet residues are shown in spheres format , while peptide ligand , a 1 helical region , and a 2 helix H1 are shown in cartoon format . Residues of interest are given individual colors . Whereas in the a 2 domain the b - bulge pb33 + pb34 residues form a supportive ridge together with pb45 for the above - positioned and parallel running pb domain H1 helix , in the a 1 domain the pa33 + pa34 b - bulge is not positioned under the a 1 domain H1 helix . In ( C a - iii ) , ( C c - i ) , the main chains of the pab b - sheets of shark pUAA and pHLA - DR1 , respectively , are shown from above in sticks format and hydrogen bonds between them are shown by dashed red lines ; residue colors match those in the pictures on the left . In pMHC - I pa and pMHC - II pb domains , the b - sheet connection between b - strands S2 and S3 extends to the p22 - p38 pair , whereas pMHC - I pb and pMHC - II pa have an “ S2 - S3 cleft ” meaning that the S2 - S3 b - sheet connection only extends to the p24 - p36 pair . ( C b , C d ) , showing superpositions of many pMHC - I or pMHC - II structures , reveal that this organization is conserved among pMHC - I and pMHC - II structures , respectively .

( D a ) The pab b - sheets of shark pUAA , pHLA - A2 , and pHLA - DR1 were superimposed and are shown from either side to highlight the loop orientations . ( D b ) The pa and pb domain b - sheets were also superimposed with each other . The conclusion from ( D a , D b ) is that the S2S3 - loop orientation is well conserved , even between pa and pb domains , but that there is a lot of variation in S1S2 - and S3S4 - loops [ see also ( C b , C d ) ] . ( D c ) shows a fragment of the ( D b ) superposition with the sidechains of the p3 , p28 , and p29 residues highlighted in sticks or lines format , with numbered dashed gray lines indicating the distance in Å between pHLA - A2 pbH3 , pbDY28 , and pbD29 . Wu et al . Structural Evolution of MHC Classes Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 621153 9 animals indicate that the paC11 - paC74 cysteine pair is not very important for MHC - II , and the pair has also been lost throughout MHC - I [ Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] . In both pMHC - I and pMHC - II , the region including pa11 interacts with the below ia domain ( b 2 - m or II - a 2 , respectively ) , and so may provide a regional stabilization causing redundancy of the stabilization by paC11 - paC74 ; in contrast , in both pMHC - I and pMHC - II , the well - conserved pbC11 - pbC74 cysteine bridge stabilizes a part of the pab domain that is free of IgSF interaction ( Supplementary File 3C ) . The lifting of the end of the C - terminal part of the pa domain helical region in pMHC - I compared to pMHC - II [ already noted by Brown et al . ( 5 ) ] may be explained by the pMHC - I pa domain strand bending backward for continuation as a pb domain strand , concurrently inserting the MHC - I - speci ﬁ c paQ87 sidechain into the pab domain bottom [ Figure 5B ( e ) ] . The pab Domain b - Sheets Show Conserved b - Bulges in Both pa and pb Domains of Both pMHC - I and pMHC - II , and Unique Differences in the Aligning of b - Strands Between pMHC - I and pMHC - II An unusual feature shared among all investigated pa and pb domains of both pMHC - I and pMHC - II is a b - bulge at positions p33 and p34 of b - strand S3 with both sidechains pointing upwards ( Figure 5C and Supplementary File 3D ) ( 5 , 49 ) . In the ancestral MHC homodimer molecule , these p33 and p34 residues probably were hydrophobic [ Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] , and the best residue conservation is found among MHC - I a 2 domains which tend to possess pb ( F / Y ) 33 and pb ( I / L ) 34 [ Figures 3A , 5C ( a ) , and Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] . Together with the pb - lineage - speci ﬁ c aromatic residue pb ( F / Y / W ) 45 , of which the sidechain “ leans over ” from b - strand S4 to b - strand S3 , in I - a 2 and II - b 1 domains the residues pb33 + pb34 + pb45 form an , in many instances hydrophobic , ridge on which the pb domain H1 helix rests ( Figure 5C ) . The better conservation of the pb33 and pb34 residues among I - a 2 than among II - b 1 sequences [ Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] suggests that the ridge function is under stricter requirements in pMHC - I than in pMHC - II . In the pa domains of pMHC - I and pMHC - II the b - bulge does not have the same function as in the pb domains because the H1 helices have a different orientation ( Figures 5A , C ) . Figure 5C and Supplementary File 3D also show remarkably conserved features that , to our knowledge , have not been noted before , and which we named “ pb S2 - S3 cleft ” in pMHC - I and “ pa S2 - S3 cleft ” in pMHC - II . These features concern that in pMHC - I pab b - sheets the a 2 domain strands S2 and S3 only show main chain pairing until residues pb24 and pb36 , respectively , and that beyond this contact the S3 + S4 strands bend away from the rest of the b - sheet ; in investigated pMHC - II structures a similar situation is found in the MHC - II a 1 domains , with pa24 and pa36 as border . Meanwhile , in pMHC - I a 1 and pMHC - II b 1 domains the S2 - to - S3 main chain pairings extend beyond the p24 - p36 interaction ( Figure 5C and Supplementary File 3D ) . The S2 - S3 clefts probably increase the regional ﬂ exibility , and their positions associate with structures that undergo pronounced positional changes upon peptide binding / editing , including the pMHC - I a 2 domain H1 helix ( 57 – 60 ) and the border region of helices H1 and H2 in pMHC - II a 1 domain ( 61 , 62 ) . Loops Connecting b - Strands S2 and S3 Show Conserved Orientations in Both pa and pb Domains of Both pMHC - I and pMHC - II , Whereas the Other pab b - Sheet Loops Can Display Considerable Variation The S2S3 - loop orientations are very well conserved in both pa and pb domains of both pMHC - I and pMHC - II [ Figure 5D ; see also the superimpositions of many pMHC - Is and pMHC - IIs in Figures 5C ( b ) and – ( d ) , respectively ] . In the MHC homodimer ancestor , though not conserved in most MHC - II pb ( II - b 1 ) domain sequences [ Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] , the S2S3 - loop probably bound to the S1 strand of the same domain by a hydrogen bond between pH3 and p ( D / E / N ) 29 as seen in extant pMHC - I pa ( I - a 1 ) , pMHC - I pb ( I - a 2 ) , and pMHC - II pa ( II - a 1 ) [ Figure 5D ( c ) ] ( 49 ) . In case of the pb domains , the S2S3 - loop tends to possess an aromatic residue at position pb28 which also participates in an interaction with residue pb3 [ Figure 5D ( c ) ] . Among MHC - II a 1 domain sequences a variety of hydrophobic residues is found at position pa28 [ Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] , which in higher tetrapods including mammals and birds tends to be phenylalanine which can interact with paH3 and paD28 reminiscent of the pMHC - I pb domain situation [ Figure 5D ( c ) ; for chicken pMHC - II see PDB 6KVM ] . Meanwhile , most MHC - I a 1 domain sequences possess paV28 which may affect the orientation of the important A pocket residue pbY81 with which it interacts ( see below ) . In contrast to the S2S3 - loops , considerable variations are observed in pa and pb domain S1S2 - and S3S4 - loop orientations among pMHC - Is [ for more details see ( 27 ) ] and in pa and pb domain S1S2 - loop orientations among pMHC - IIs [ Figures 5C ( b ) and – ( d ) , and 5D ] . The pa and pb domain S3S4 loop orientations of pMHC - II and pMHC - I in primitive animals are similar and probably re ﬂ ect the orientation within the ancestral MHC homodimer ; compared to this , the S3S4 loops of mammalian pMHC - I pa ( I - a 1 ) domains are two residues longer , and the S3S4 loops of mammalian pMHC - I pa ( I - a 2 ) domains have ﬂ ipped upwards [ Figures 3A , 5C ( b ) and – ( d ) , and 5D ] [ for more details see ( 27 ) ] . In pMHC - I the Peptide Ligand P1 and P9 Positions Are Closer Together Than in pMHC - II , and the P1 Sidechain Points Upwards Instead of Downwards . In contrast to pMHC - Is , in pMHC - IIs the groove ends are open , and the peptide lays in the groove in an extended , polyproline - like manner ( 5 , 63 ) . Although in pMHC - IIs the peptides typically are > 9 aa and extend beyond the groove ends , the core interaction within the pMHC - II groove concerns a 9 aa peptide fragment as in most pMHC - Is , and the start and end residues of such fragment are named P1 and P9 ( the residues N - terminal of the P1 residue are named P - 1 , P - 2 , etc . ) . Whereas in pMHC - I the P1 sidechain points upwards and the P W sidechain points downwards , in pMHC - II both the P1 and P9 sidechains point downwards ( Figure 6A ) in a semi - symmetric structure . The distances between the P1 and P9 pockets ( aka A and F pockets in pMHC - I ) in the groove of pMHC - II are larger than in pMHC - I ( Figure 6A ) , and the linear distances between the C a atoms of pMHC - I peptide residues P1 and P W ( P9 in 9 aa peptides ) are similar to those between pMHC - II peptide residues P2 and P9 Wu et al . Structural Evolution of MHC Classes Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 621153 10 A B D E F G C FIGURE 6 | Continued Wu et al . Structural Evolution of MHC Classes Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 621153 11 ( see Figure 6A legend ) . The different organization explains why peptide ligands of 9 aa length bulge in pMHC - Is , whereas in pMHC - IIs the peptide ligand main chains are in a regular extended con ﬁ guration ( Figure 6A ) . Naturally , as has been shown in multiple studies but is not shown here , in pMHC - I structures with peptides > 9 aa , the bulging is more extensive ( e . g . , 64 , 65 ) . At a different note , the closing of the pMHC - I P1 and P9 pockets for peptide extensions beyond the groove is not absolute , but for such discussion we refer to other articles ( 66 – 69 ) . Peptide Binding in pMHC - II Is Rather Symmetric , but in pMHC - I the P1 Pocket Very Much Changed in Comparison to pMHC - II and the Presumed Homodimer Ancestor The peptide binding mode in pMHC - II is characterized by pa - pb semi - symmetry and presumably similar to a symmetric peptide binding mode of the ancestral MHC homodimer . In pMHC - IIs , three ancient residues that make hydrogen bonds with the peptide ligand main chain are paN77 , pbW60 , and pbN77 ( 5 , 12 , 39 , 54 ) , and they can bind peptides in either N - to - C or C - to - N direction ( Figure 6B ) ( 55 ) . The ancestral MHC homodimer presumably possessed a symmetry of pW60 and p ( D / N ) 77 in each p domain , as speci ﬁ c loss of pW60 in the MHC - II pa lineage is suggested by the presence of pW60 in MHC - II pb as well as in MHC - I pa and pb [ Figure 3A and Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] . In pMHC - Is , ancestral residues ( or residue characteristics ) for forming hydrogen bonds with the peptide ligand were conserved in the form of pa ( D / N / S ) 77 and pbW60 ( better known as “ W147 ” ) , although their hydrogen bonding with the peptide ligand is not consistently conserved among pMHC - Is and may depend on the HC allele and the bulging of the particular peptide ligand ( e . g . , Figure 6C ) ( 27 , 30 , 70 ) . In pMHC - Is , the paW60 residue , because of reorganization of the respective pa domain helical region , can no longer participate in peptide binding [ Figures 5B ( b ) and – ( d ) , 6F , G ] . Furthermore , in pMHC - Is , the ancestral pb ( D / N ) 77 was replaced by the large hydrophobic pbW77 , which because of a rotation in the respective pb domain helical region has its sidechain pointing more upwards and blocking the groove at the P1 pocket side [ Figures 5B ( a ) , - ( c ) , and – ( d ) , 6F , G ] . Besides the ancestral paN77 , pbW60 , and pbN77 residues , the MHC - II lineage rather consistently possesses the two residues paN70 and pb ( H / N ) 76 for ( presumably ) making hydrogen bonds with the peptide ligand main chain ( Figure 6B ) ( 5 , 12 , 39 , 54 ) ; residue pbN76 is only common in MHC - II of primitive vertebrates [ Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] , and its possible hydrogen bonding with the peptide ligand remains to be determined . In pMHC - I , residues at positions pa70 and pb76 in pMHC - I do not possess homogeneous characteristics [ Figure 3A and Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] and do not usually bind the peptide ligand main chain ( Figure 6C ) . Therefore , and also because they are not part of an ancient pa - pb symmetry , we assume that paN70 and pb ( H / N ) 76 were speci ﬁ cally acquired / ﬁ xated in the MHC - II lineage . Conserved orientations of the here listed MHC - II residues are shown in the pMHC - II superposition ﬁ gure in Figure 6D ( note that mouse H2 - Ag7 possesses pbY60 instead of the typical pbW60 ) . The P9 pockets ( aka F pocket in case of pMHC - I ) are quite similar between pMHC - I and pMHC - II , but in pMHC - I a higher number of residues for peptide ligand main chain binding were acquired / ﬁ xated including pa ( R / Y ) 84 , pbT56 ( aka “ T143 ” ) , and pbK59 ( “ T146 ” ) [ Figures 3A , 6C and Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] ( 27 , 71 ) . Explanations for why in pMHC - Is the groove is closed , while in pMHC - IIs the groove is open , are , in the case of pMHC - I , the higher and lower positions of the sidechains of the pa84 and pb59 residues , respectively ( Figures 6F , G ) ( 5 ) . A mechanical explanation for the lifting of the C - terminal part of the pa domain helical region in pMHC - I compared to pMHC - II , was discussed above [ Figure 5B ( e ) ] . Even among pMHC - I P9 pockets there is some variation in the contribution of the conserved peptide binding residues ( examples in Figures 6C , E ) ( 27 , 70 , 72 ) , and pMHC - I P9 pockets may need some ﬂ exibility for engul ﬁ ng various amino acid sidechains . In contrast to the P9 pockets , the P1 pockets ( aka A pocket in case of pMHC - I ) are very different between pMHC - I and FIGURE 6 | The peptide binding groove and the peptide ligand . ( A ) Comparison of peptide orientations in shark pUAA and representative pMHC - I and pMHC - II structures based on superimposing of pab domains . Peptides are shown in ribbon format , with P1 and P9 / W main chain residues additionally shown in sticks format . P1 and P9 / W sidechains , and pbW60 and pa ( R / Y ) 84 residues ( shown to help with orientation ) , are shown in lines format . In the sticks and lines formats , red and blue represent oxygen and nitrogen atoms , respectively . The important conclusion is that the P9 / W residue is orientated similarly in pMHC - I and pMHC - II , but that compared to the presumed ancestral situation , as found in pMHC - II , the P1 residue in pMHC - I has shifted in C - terminal direction ( to the right ) and has rotated so that the sidechain points upwards instead of downwards . Examples of distances between C a atoms are : pHLA - DR1 P1 - P9 , 25 . 7 Å ; pHLA - DR1 P2 - P9 , 22 . 5 Å ; shark pUAA P1 - P9 , 23 . 2 Å ; and pHLA - A2 P1 - P9 , 22 . 1 Å . ( B ) The ancient character of the pMHC - II mode of binding is re ﬂ ected in HLA - DR1 being able to bind CLIP peptides in both orientations [ from the study by Günther et al . ( 56 ) ] . Names of residues commonly conserved among pMHC - IIs for binding the peptide ligand main chain are boxed , and yellow boxes indicate residues presumably inherited from the ancestral MHC homodimer ; some of the highlighted residues are only shown for easier comparison with the pMHC - I situation . Dashed yellow lines represent polar contacts . ( C ) This ﬁ gure is in a similar style as ( B ) , but from the viewpoint of pMHC - I , showing two representative pMHC - I structures . In the P1 pocket , a water molecule , indicated with a red sphere , participates in a hydrogen bond network by making hydrogen bonds with paY7 , paY59 , and paE63 . ( D ) Superposition of the pab domains of three representative pMHC - II structures shows the conserved orientations of the highlighted residues paN70 , paN77 , pbW60 , pbH76 , and pbN77 commonly involved in peptide ligand main chain binding ( B ) ; mouse H2 - Ag7 is an exception in that it has a tyrosine at the pb60 position . ( E ) is a similar ﬁ gure as ( D ) , but from the viewpoint of pMHC - I and a superposition of representative pMHC - I structures . Conserved residues involved in peptide ligand main chain binding ( C ) are highlighted , and show a better conservation in the P1 pocket ( left ) than in the P9 pocket ( right ) . ( F - i , F - iii , F - iv ) show pab domain ( without peptides ) superpositions of pMHC - I ( Shark UAA , Carp UAA , Chicken BF2 * 0401 , HLA - A2 ) and pMHC - II ( Chicken BL2 * 01901 , Mouse I - Ak , HLA - DR1 ) structures , and ( F - ii ) is a surface presentation of the shark pUAA pab orientation shown in ( F - i ) to make the ( F ) ﬁ gure panel easier to understand ; for this ﬁ gure , mouse I - Ak was chosen over mouse H2 - Ag7 because it possesses ancient pbW60 . ( F ) highlights the residues at positions p59 , p60 , p77 , and p84 , as they are very important for the groove end and peptide binding characteristics , and they may all represent ancient features or lineage - speci ﬁ c deviations from ancient features ; the ancestral MHC homodimer presumably possessed pW60 and p ( D / N ) 77 and may have possessed a large hydrophilic sidechain at p59 , while possibly the pa ( R / Y ) 84 residue was ancestral to the I - a 1 / II - a 1 lineage [ Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] . ( G ) shows , in surface format with coloring of all molecules as done for shark pUAA in ( F ) , the individual pab domains that were compared by superposition in ( F ) ; the view angles slightly differ per pMHC in order to maximally show their individual features . The views in ( F , G ) from P1 and P9 directions help to understand why in pMHC - Is the groove ends are closed and in pMHC - IIs they are not , although at the P9 ends the differences are rather subtle . Wu et al . Structural Evolution of MHC Classes Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 621153 12 pMHC - II . A critical difference caused by the change and reorientation of the ancestral pbN77 into pMHC - I pbW77 was explained above , and this change forced the P1 residue of the peptide ligand to bind more towards the center of the groove ( Figures 6A , F , G ) . This was accompanied by another critical change , namely the binding of the P1 main chain at the bottom of the P1 pocket instead of the P1 sidechain as seen in pMHC - II . For this purpose , in MHC - I sequences a number of new residues were acquired / ﬁ xated , including paY7 , paY59 , pa ( D / E / Q ) 63 , pbY70 ( “ Y159 ” ) , and pbY81 ( “ Y171 ” ) for participating in a hydrogen - bond network with the main chain of peptide ligand residue P1 [ Figures 3A , 6C and Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] ; the tyrosines among these residues show near - absolute conservation in orientation ( Figure 6E ) , which is possible because the pMHC - I P1 pocket needs little ﬂ exibility since the P1 sidechain points out of the groove ( Figure 6A ) ( 27 , 71 ) . For the evolutionary creation of the P1 pocket in the MHC - I lineage it was also important that residue paG26 was acquired / ﬁ xated [ Figure 3A and Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] , because the absence of a sidechain at this position allows paY7 to reach the P1 pocket [ Figure 5C ( a - i ) ] . It is dif ﬁ cult to speculate which of the unique pMHC - I P1 pocket residues and features was acquired ﬁ rst in evolution . In some MHC - I , the pbW77 was lost with the consequences not well understood , such as in the elucidated frog UAA structure ( 30 ) which possesses pbG77 ( Figure 6E ) . Although the Overall Orientation of the ia Domain Is Similar Between pMHC - I and pMHC - II , only in pMHC - I the Domain Acquired a Hydrophobic Knob That Inserts Into the pab Domain b - Sheet Supplementary Files 2A , B list all residues that according to PDBePISA software analysis are part of the ia to pab interface of several representative pMHC - I and pMHC - II structures ; relevant pHLA - A2 and pHLA - DR1 residues are highlighted in the structural ﬁ gures in Figures 7A ( a ) , 7B ( a ) , with their names colored according to conservation patterns as shown in Figure 3 and Supplementary File 1A . Among the , probably ancestral , interface residues shared between pMHC - I and pMHC - II are : pa ( D / E / Q ) 32 , paR48 , pbQ6 , pb ( Q / R ) 25 , iaP32 , iaP33 , and ia ( F / Y ) 62 [ also see Supplementary File 3A ( b ) ] ; among these residues , pa ( D / E / Q ) 32 is better conserved in MHC - II whereas pbQ6 , pb ( Q / R ) 25 and iaP33 are better conserved in MHC - I ( Supplementary File 1A ) . In contrast to pMHC - I , pMHC - II only has a few speci ﬁ c residues at the ia - to - pab interface [ shaded non - dark blue in Figure 7B ( a ) ] , namely iaF54 , pa ( E / Q ) 23 , pa ( D / E / N ) 31 , and paE32 , the last two of which participate in the connection between the pab domain and the IgSF domains at the P1 side of the pab domain ( see below ) . Compared to pMHC - II and , presumably , to the last common ancestor of MHC - I and MHC - II , the biggest change in the pMHC - I interdomain contacts was the acquisition of the iaF56 + iaW60 hydrophobic knob and its insertion into the pab pa9 pleat [ Figure 7A and Supplementary File 3E ] ; in pMHC - II structures , at the corresponding position , the pa9 pleat is closed by sidechains from the pleat ridge residues [ Figure 7B and Supplementary File 3E ] . The establishment of the iaF56 + iaW60 hydrophobic knob in MHC - I was accompanied by acquisition / ﬁ xation of a large set of interacting residues that have been well conserved throughout extant MHC - I from shark to human [ Figure 3 and Supplementary Files 1A , 2A , and 3A ( a ) ] [ for more details see ( 27 ) ] . The ib to pab Interdomain Interface in pMHC - II Acquired a Large Hydrophobic Tryptophan Residue Whereas in pMHC - I an iW60 residue was acquired in the ia ( b 2 - m ) domain [ Figure 3B and Supplementary File 1A ( b ) ] , making a large interaction with the pab domain that involves a set of additionally selected residues [ Figure 7A ( a ) ] , in pMHC - II a reminiscent situation is observed for a speci ﬁ cally acquired iW60 residue in the ib ( II - b 2 ) domain ( Figure 8 ) ( 73 , 74 ) . Figure 8A shows how in pHLA - DR1 the ibW60 residue inserts into the pab domain and is surrounded by multiple conserved residues including ones speci ﬁ cally selected in MHC - II , namely pa ( D / E / N ) 31 , paE32 , pa ( I / L ) 49 , and paF52 . Whereas the iaW60 residue in pMHC - I structures binds closer to the P9 side of the pab domain [ Figure 7A ( b ) ] , the ibW60 residue in pMHC - II structures binds to the ﬂ oor at the P1 end of the pab domain ( Figure 8B ) ( 73 , 74 ) . Figure 8C shows the dramatic difference in ib - pab interfaces caused by having a large ibW60 in pMHC - II b 2 domains rather than a small ibG60 common among pMHC - I a 3 domains . Considering the frequent ﬁ nding of iG60 in non - MHC IgSF sequences [ Supplementary File 1A ( b ) ] , we speculate that glycine represents the ancestral MHC residue at this position . At the end of the MHC - I pb domain , residue pbL90 , which is speci ﬁ cally conserved in MHC - I but probably also ancestral to MHC - II , forms a conserved structure with MHC - I - speci ﬁ c residues paV28 , paW51 , and pbY81 ( Figure 8D ) . The nearby pbR90b residue also appears to be ancestral to both MHC - I and MHC - II [ Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] and tends to strengthen the contact between the end of the pb domain and the ib domain by making one or more polar contacts with the main chain of ibG60 ( in case of pMHC - I ) or ibW60 ( in case of pMHC - II ) in most of the investigated structures ( Figure 8D and data not shown ) . Shark UAA is an exception , as a residue was lost in this region [ Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] , and the sidechain of shark pUAA pbR90b points in a different direction ( Figure 8D ) . The ia to ib Interdomain Interface Is Different Between pMHC - I and pMHC - II Supplementary Files 2C , D list all residues that according to PDBePISA software analysis are part of the ia to ib domain interface of representative pMHC - I and pMHC - II structures . In both pMHC - Is and pMHC - IIs , the interaction between the ia and ib domains basically involves their S1 - S2 - S5 - S4 ( ABED ) sheets , with the ia domain participating more with its S1 and S2 strands , and the ib domain participating more with its S4 and S5 strands [ Supplementary File 3B ( a ) ] ( 49 ) . The iaY10 - ibP56 bond , which is highly conserved in pMHC - I , appears to be absent in pMHC - II . Namely , ( i ) in MHC - II sequences ibP56 is very uncommon and iaY10 is only partially conserved and seems , judging from its conservation pattern [ Supplementary File 1A ( b ) ] , functionally Wu et al .

( A a ) The pMHC - I structures , here represented by pHLA - A2 , have many conserved residues / features at the b 2 - m to a 1 a 2 interface ( for a complete list of interface residues see Supplementary Files 2A , B ) , especially at the pa9 pleat contact region . Also , a contact patch involving paT10 and pbQ6 ( both part of the pa9 pleat ) and pbT4 and b 2 - m ia33 ( mostly iaP33 ) and iaF62 is relatively well conserved . Many of the indicated residue names are shaded with non - white colors , which are based on estimated conservation patterns and are also used in Figure 3 and Supplementary File 1A : black , inherited from the MHC homodimer ancestor ; dark blue , ancestral to the I - a 1 + b 2 - m / II a lineage ; purple , ancestral to the I - a 2 + I - a 3 / II b lineage ; light blue , characteristic for the I - a 1 + b 2 - m lineage ; pink , characteristic for the I - a 2 + I - a 3 lineage . The a 1 a 2 domain is indicated in surface format with only yellow for pa9 pleat top ridge residues ( the ability to see them in this ﬁ gure is evidence of the pleat being open ) and element coloring for the other a 1 a 2 domain residues with red , blue , and gold for O , N , and S atoms , respectively , dark and light green for the C atoms of the pa9 pleat pa8 and pa10 lower ridge residues , respectively , and white for the other C atoms . The b 2 - m domain is shown in cyan transparent cartoon format with sidechains of highlighted residues in element color sticks format . The black and white striped region is the a 1 a 2 domain with a 3 domain contact region . Residue pbS35 does not directly contact b 2 - m but pa ( A / S / T ) 45 is a conserved part of the constellation . ( A b ) The b 2 - m iaF56 + iaW60 residues ( shown in individual , element color spheres format ) insert into the pa9 pleat , which can easily be seen from this angle with the a 1 a 2 domain [ coloring as in ( A ) ] shown in ribbon format and the sidechains of the pa9 pleat pa8 and pa10 lower ridges in sticks format .

( A ) Shown here for pHLA - DR1 , the MHC - II b - speci ﬁ c residue ibW60 residue together with the more ancient residue ibY31 forms a knob ( indicated in sticks format plus transparent surface presentation ) which inserts into the pab domain . Pab residues surrounding this knob , and also paH3 as being part of the paH3 / paF28 / paD29 interaction [ Figure 5D ( c ) ] , are highlighted in sticks format . Residue ibW60 makes polar contacts with paD31 and paE32 . Color shading of residue names , as in Figure 7B ( a ) , refers to conservation patterns ( see above and Supplementary File 1A ) , with light purple used for MHC - II b - characteristic residues . ( B - i ) and ( B - ii ) help to understand the position of pHLA - DR1 ibW60 ( sidechain in spheres format ) relative to the pab groove and the P1 residue . ( C ) At the position where pMHC - II possesses the very large ibW60 , in pMHC - Is the very small ibG60 tends to be found ( together with ibY31 indicated in spheres format ) . Whereas in pMHC - IIs the sidechain of a characteristic paD31 residue makes a polar contact with the ibW60 main chain , in pMHC - Is a variety of residues is found at pa31 ( green ) . The pa + pb + ia domains are indicated in wheat color transparent surface format and the ib domains are indicated in cyan color cartoon format . ( D ) Shared between most elucidated pMHC - IIs and pMHC - Is is a polar contact between pbR90b sidechain and ib60 main chain , but in shark pUAA this contact was lost . Some other residues characteristic for this region in either pMHC - II or pMHC - I , and their counterparts in the other MHC class , are highlighted in several manners , with only ib60 coloring based on elements . Wu et al . Structural Evolution of MHC Classes Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 621153 15 equivalent to iaF10 ( bearing a sidechain without polar groups ) , and ( ii ) in elucidated pMHC - II structures , in contrast to pMHC - I , the ib56 residue is not close to the ia10 residue ( Figure 9 ) . On the other hand , in both chicken and mammalian pMHC - IIs , a tyrosine at position ia67 makes a hydrogen bond with the ibN57 main chain [ Supplementary File 3B ( b ) ] and , given the presence of these residues in MHC - II of cartilaginous ﬁ sh — though iaY67 is poorly conserved in ray - ﬁ nned ﬁ sh [ Supplementary File 1A ( b ) ] — , iaY67 - ibN57 may represent an ancestral pMHC - II interaction . The pMHC IgSF Domains Inherited Some Unique Structural Features From the Presumed Homodimer Ancestor That Are Best Conserved in pMHC - II ; For Unknown Reasons , Some Consensus IgSF Features Have Not Been Well Conserved in pMHC - I The b - strands of C1 set IgSF domains of various MHC and non - MHC molecules superimpose well ( 75 ) . However , considerable variation can be found in the relative orientations of their S1S2 - loops and interacting S5S6 - loops ( Figure 10A ) , which in pMHCs are positioned distal to ( away from ) the pab domain . Although among the different pMHC IgSF domains the S5S6 - loop orientations tend to be similar , the S1S2 - loop orientation can differ a lot ( Figure 10A ) . The pMHC ia domains ( b 2 - m and II - a 2 ) possess the MHC IgSF consensus orientation of the S1S2 - loops ( Figure 10A ) , which we assume to have been inherited from the MHC homodimer ancestor . This S1S2 - loop consensus orientation is only found in approximately half of the investigated pMHC - II ib ( II - b 2 ) domain structures , while among the pMHC - I ib ( I - a 3 ) domains there is little consensus ( Figure10A ) ; thevariationamongI - a 3S1S2 - loopsisalsore ﬂ ected intheirvariablelengths [ Figure3B and SupplementaryFile1A ( b ) ] . When pMHC structures representative of the MHC IgSF S1S2 - loop plus S5S - loop consensus organization are compared with several non - MHC C1 set IgSF domains , it is seen that this organization is uncommon ( Figure 10B ) . Figure 11 shows important structures in the internal organization of the pMHC IgSF domains . Interestingly , compared to pMHC - II and the deduced ancestral situation , in pMHC - I evolution there have been complete or partial losses of features that probably increase the rigidity of the IgSF domains . Namely : ( i ) in pMHC - II a 2 and b 2 domains , as common among IgSF domains ( 76 ) , the conserved iW39 and iL68 residues interact and form part of a topohydrophobic inner core , whereas iW39 ( 77 ) and iL68 were lost in b 2 - m , iL68 was lost in I - a 3 , and iW39 has not been not stringently conserved in I - a 3 [ Figure 11A and Supplementary File 1A ( b ) ] ; ( ii ) The iW95 residue and its orientation , possibly supporting the S1S2 and S5S6 loops region , are very well conserved among pMHC - II a 2 and b 2 domains , but not among pMHC - I a 3 and b 2 - m domains [ Figure 11B and Supplementary Files 1A ( b ) , 1B ( b ) last picture ] . The iW95 residue is very uncommon in non - MHC IgSF molecules and probably was speci ﬁ cally established in the MHC homodimer ancestral molecule [ Supplementary File 1A ( b ) ] . The iW95 orientation in pMHC - II IgSF domains [ Figure 11B ] probably represents the ancestral situation . Experimental replacement of b 2 - m iW95 by a glycine has been reported to induce protein instability , con ﬁ rming a role of iW95 in b 2 - m stabilization ( 78 ) . The lack of strict conservation of the I - a 3 domain structures is highlighted by the single residue shift in the main chain pairing between b - strands S6 and S7 in frog pMHC - I [ last two pictures in Supplementary File 1B ( b ) ] . Taken together , among the different pMHC IgSF domains , the MHC - II a 2 domain appears to be the most conservative and representative of the IgSF structure in the MHC homodimer ancestor regarding the combined features of S1S2 - loop orientation , IgSF - typical topohydrophobic inner core , and iW95 orientation . MHC - II a Plus MHC - II b Genetic Fusions in Lung ﬁ shes Suggest Another Possible Route for the Creation of MHC - I Genes From MHC - II - Like Ancestral Genes In four different lung ﬁ sh species , we found transcripts encoding soluble proteins consisting of fusions of MHC - II a and MHC - II b with a linker in between ( Figure 12A and Supplementary File 4 ) , which we named MHC - IIabSol . For three of the species we assembled these sequences by hand from single read archive ( SRA ) NCBI databases , namely for slender lung ﬁ sh ( Protopterus dolloi ) , West African lung ﬁ sh ( Protopterus annectens ) , and Australian lung ﬁ sh ( Neoceratodus forsteri ) . For South American lung ﬁ sh ( Lepidosiren paradoxa ) sequence , a similar sequence was retrieved from an NCBI transcriptome shotgun assembly ( TSA ) database . For slender lung ﬁ sh , we con ﬁ rmed the MHC - IIabSol sequence experimentally using RNA from kidney . Indications that the gene encoding MHC - IIabSol might also produce single a or b chains , or transmembrane proteins , were not observed ; however , we dedicated little effort to potentially ﬁ nding alternatively spliced transcripts , and we cannot deny their possible existence . Although recombinant fusions between A B FIGURE 9 | The interface between the ia and ib domains .

Structural Evolution of MHC Classes Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 621153 16 II a and II b have been created arti ﬁ cially as a tool for MHC research ( e . g . , 79 ) , we are not aware of previous reports on their natural existence . Considering their conservation of peptide - binding residues ( Supplementary File 4B ) , the MHC - IIabSol proteins are expected to bind proteins . How a secreted pMHC - II molecule can have a biological function is unclear at this moment . The Australian and other lung ﬁ shes separated > 150 million years ago ( 80 ) , concluding that MHC - IIabSol is ancient . Phylogenetic tree analysis is not conclusive on how to cluster MHC - IIabSol with classical MHC - II sequences ( Supplementary File 4C ) , which is a common problem when comparing proteins with different functions over large evolutionary distances ( 14 ) . However , the sequences ( Supplementary File 4B ) and trees for the different domains ( Supplementary File 4C ) collectively suggest that MHC - IIabSol was established from classical MHC - II genes only in Sarcopterygii ( lobe - ﬁ nned ﬁ sh plus tetrapods ) , possibly only in Dipnomorpha ( lung ﬁ shes ) . In the context of the present paper , we are predominantly interested in MHC - IIabSol because its MHC - II a to MHC - II b fusion suggests an alternative possible route for II - I evolution . Namely , rather than that a translocation event directly created an MHC - I / b 2 - m ectodomain exon organization from an MHC - II - like organization ( the Figure 1 model ) , an intermediate step in the creation of the MHC - I / b 2 - m system might have been an MHC - II a / MHC - II b genetic fusion as speculated in Figure 12B . DISCUSSION The present study is the ﬁ rst to extensively compare structures of pMHC - I with pMHC - II . After Pamela Bjorkman as part of the Don Wiley group was the ﬁ rst in 1987 to elucidate a pMHC - I structure ( 4 ) , hitherto , the most comprehensive analysis of pMHC - I structural organization had been the seminal study in 1991 by Saper , Bjorkman , and Wiley ( 49 ) ; both studies only investigated pHLA - A2 . After the ﬁ rst pMHC - II structure was reported in 1993 by Brown et al . ( 5 ) , global comparisons between pMHC - I and pMHC - II structures were made [ e . g . , ( 5 , 7 ) ] , but those studies did not achieve the comprehensiveness of the Saper et al . ( 49 ) analysis , and the majority of the pMHC structural studies that followed focused on peptide - binding groove properties . To our knowledge , other than discussion of how genes and exons may have been duplicated , differentiated , and / or shuf ﬂ ed [ e . g . , ( 20 – 23 ) ] , the early evolution of pMHC structures has hardly been discussed before . In Supplementary File 5 , we propose a model of the major structural changes in the evolution of an ancestral MHC homodimer towards extant pMHC - I and pMHC - II . In the present study , we do not speculate on the type of homodimer molecules that may have been the evolutionary origin of the MHC homodimer molecules , and for such speculation we refer to our previous study ( 15 ) . A B FIGURE 10 | Organization of MHC IgSF domain S1S2 and S5S6 loops . ( A ) Superpositions of representative pMHC - II and pMHC - I IgSF domains ( left part of the ﬁ gure ) and many pMHC - II and pMHC - I IgSF domains ( all colored in gray ; right part of the ﬁ gure ) show that the MHC IgSF consensus orientation of the S1S2 and S5S6 orientations are well conserved in the pMHC - II and pMHC - I ia domains ; ( B ) if representative MHC IgSF domains possessing this organization are compared with a variety of non - MHC IgSF C1 set domains , it can be seen that especially their S1S2 - loop orientation is quite uncommon . Wu et al . Structural Evolution of MHC Classes Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 621153 17 The MHC homodimer ancestral state probably concerned a symmetric molecular structure ( Figure 13 , which corresponds to Stage 1 in Supplementary File 5 ) . Probable features were a pab domain with an 8 - stranded b - sheet , as common in extant pMHC - I and pMHC - II ( Figure 5A ) , topped by two helical structures each similar to as found in extant pMHC - II pb ( II - b 1 ) domains [ Figures 4B ( a ) , 5B ( a ) ] . Characteristic features of the b - sheet were the p33 + p34 b - bulge ( Figure 5C and Supplementary File 3D ) and the S2S3 - and S3S4 - loop orientations [ Figures 5C ( b ) and - ( d ) , and 5D ] . The peptide probably was bound , as in extant pMHC - II , in an extended poly - proline - like fashion , and important residues for peptide main chain binding presumably were pW60 and p ( D / N ) 77 ( Figure 6 ) . Unique features of the MHC homodimer IgSF domains appear to have been their S1S2 - plus S5S6 - loop orientations ( Figure 10 ) in combination with residue iW95 ( Figure 11 ) ; these features locate distal from the pab domains , and , although this is speculation only , by increasing local stability they may have allowed modi ﬁ cations in other parts of the IgSF domains . The homodimer ancestral gene must have duplicated and given rise to the early MHC a - and b - lineage genes ( Figure 1 ) ( 20 , 21 ) , which together encoded an MHC - II - like heterodimer structure . Several a - and b - lineage - speci ﬁ c residues are rather well conserved in both MHC - I and MHC - II ( Figure 3 and Supplementary File 1A ) . The most dramatic change from the homodimer ancestral structure to the last common structure before the evolutionary separation of the MHC - I and MHC - II lineages ( Stage 2 in Supplementary File 5 ) presumably was the repositioning of the IgSF domain ia domain ( b 2 - m or II - a 2 in extant pMHC ) . Bjorkman et al . ( 4 ) already noted that the asymmetrical organization of the pMHC - I IgSF domains was very distinct from a typical homodimer - like structure , and the observed , unusual , central position of the ia domain under the pab ﬂ oor was later con ﬁ rmed for pMHC - II ( 5 ) . Given that there is no space for two IgSF domains at that central position , this cannot have been the IgSF orientation in a symmetrical ancestral MHC homodimer structure , and the IgSF domain orientations may have been more similar to those of ib domains ( I - a 3 and A B FIGURE 11 | Representative MHC IgSF domains with the structurally important residues iC25 - iC80 cysteine pair , iW39 , iL68 , and iW95 , or their replacements . Highlighted residues are shown with individual colors per position and with spheres format presentation for sidechains . ( A , B ) Are from different angles . Residue coloring in ( B ) is as in ( A ) , but In ( A ) the i95 residues are not highlighted . Wu et al . Structural Evolution of MHC Classes Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 621153 18 II - b 2 ) in extant pMHC ( as speculated in Figure 13A ) . The central position of the ia domain orientation may have stabilized the pab ﬂ oor and so have allowed modi ﬁ cations of the pa domain helix organization . However , it is unclear in how far the different pa domain helix organizations in extant pMHC - I a 1 and pMHC - II a 1 share a common history , although they do share common differences from the presumed ancestral helix organization found in extant pMHC - II b 1 domains [ Figures 3A , 5B ( b ) and – ( d ) ] . Possibly , an increased ﬂ exibility of the pa domain helical region near the P1 pocket may have contributed to peptide ligand selectivity , as is known for extant pMHC - II in mammals ( 62 ) . Dominant changes from the time of the last common MHC - I and MHC - II ancestor towards extant MHC - II ( Stage 3a in Supplementary File 5 ) presumably were : ( i ) the melting of part of the pa domain ( II - a 1 domain ) helical region at the border between the H1 and H2 helices [ Figure 5B ( b ) ] , probably in order to enhance peptide editing abilities ( 12 , 56 ) ; ( ii ) acquisition of residue ibW60 in the MHC - II b 2 domain [ Supplementary File 1A ( b ) ] for insertion into the pab domain near the P1 pocket ( Figure 8 ) ( 73 , 74 ) , possibly for strengthening the local pab ﬂ oor ; ( iii ) the acquisition of peptide binding groove residues paN70 in the II - a 1 domain and pb ( H / N ) 76 in the II - b 1 domain for binding the peptide ligand main chain ( Figure 6B ) , possibly to compensate for the loss of the ancestral pW60 in the II - a 1 domain ( Figures 3A , 6F and Supplementary File 1A ) ; and ( iv ) — although this remains to be determined for amphibians and ﬁ shes — an “ S2 - S3 cleft ” in the pa part of the pab domain b - sheet , possibly for increasing the ﬂ exibility of the P1 pocket region ( Figure 5C and Supplementary File 3D ) . Sequence comparisons indicate that the change of the P1 pocket pa helical region together with the probable strengthening of the P1 pocket ﬂ oor by ibW60 is shared among MHC - II throughout jawed vertebrate species ( Supplementary File 1A ) , despite that nonclassical MHC - II lineage DM , which binds to the classical pMHC - II P1 pocket pa helical wall and so participates in peptide editing ( 62 ) , has only been found from the level of Rhipidistia ( Dipnomorpha plus tetrapods ) ( 15 ) . It has been speculated that in more primitive jawed vertebrates , DM - like peptide editing function may be executed by classical MHC - II in higher order complexes ( 12 , 15 ) . Pronounced changes did occur from the last common ancestor with MHC - II towards extant MHC - I ( Stage 3b in Supplementary File 5 ) . We propose that the major changes for creating extant MHC - I were : ( i ) Establishment of covalent pa + pb + ib + CP / TM / CY ( HC ) and free ia ( b 2 - m ) by a process involving exon shuf ﬂ ing events , possibly by a route as proposed in Figure 1 ( 20 , 21 ) or as in Figure 5 ; ( ii ) Creation of a closed pab groove ( Figures 5B and 6F , G ) with a new P1 pocket closer to the pab center ( Figures 5A , 6 ) and the acquisition of new / additional P1 and P9 pocket residues [ Figures 3A , 6 and Supplementary File 1A ( a ) ] ( iii ) Establishment of three unique interdomain interactions involving the ia domain residues iaY10 , iaD53 , and iaF56 + iaW60 ( Figures 7 , 9 and Supplementary Files 1 , 3A , B , E ) ; and ( iv ) , an “ S2 - S3 cleft ” in the pb part of the pab domain b - sheet which may increase the ﬂ exibility of the P9 pocket region ( Figure 5C and Supplementary File 3D ) . As for the third point , especially the insertion of the hydrophobic iaF56 + iaW60 knob into the pa9 pleat of the pab domain made a big structural difference and , in evolution , was accompanied by the A B FIGURE 12 | The ﬁ nding of a natural genetic fusion between MHC - II a and MHC - II b in lung ﬁ shes suggest the possibility of a “ II - to - I ” evolution route different from that proposed by Kaufman et al . ( 20 , 21 ) . ( A ) In lung ﬁ shes , transcripts encoding MHC - IIabSol were identi ﬁ ed , comprising a leader sequence , MHC - II a 1 and a 2 domains , a linker , MHC - II b 1 and b 2 domains , and a short C - terminus ( for sequences see Supplementary File 4A ) . ( B ) A genetic fusion combining the four MHC - II a - like and MHC - II b - like ectodomain exons may have been an intermediate in the creation of MHC - I from MHC - II - like ancestral genes .

Structural Evolution of MHC Classes Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 621153 19 acquisition / ﬁ xation of a large set of interacting residues [ Figure 7A ( a ) and Supplementary Files 1A , 2A , B , 3A ] . In our joint study we provided experimental evidence by alanine exchanges showing that all four b 2 - m residues iaY10 , iaD53 , iaF56 , and iaW60 are important for pMHC - I complex formation ( 27 ) , whereas previous studies only showed this for iaD53 and iaW60 ( 78 , 81 ) . Comparison of sequences and structures suggest that the ia and ib IgSF domains in pMHC - I lost some rigidity compared to these domains in pMHC - II and in the presumed ancestral MHC homodimer ( Figure 11 ) . This may be related to a single b 2 - m molecule having to be able to bind a variety of different I - a 3 domains of classical and nonclassical MHC - I ( e . g . , 17 ) , or with an induced ﬁ t mechanism . However , as for the latter , the only consistent structural difference of free b 2 - m versus b 2 - m within pMHC - I complexes , analyzed for a variety of species , appears to concern that the orientations of the iaF56 and iaW60 residues in free b 2 - m are different from that in pMHC - I ; however , although their orientations are similar among pMHC - Is , they differ between free b 2 - m of different species , making a more detailed discussion dif ﬁ cult ( 27 ) . MHC - II appear to represent the older MHC organization in regard to molecular structure , intron - exon organization , and peptide binding . Nevertheless , overall , the pa and pb domain sequences of MHC - I are better conserved in long term evolution , including ancestral residues that predate the separation of the MHC - I and MHC - II lineages ( Supplementary Files 1A , C ) . This probably relates to the requirements for MHC - I function being more stringent than for MHC - II function . A big question is why both MHC - I and MHC - II evolved and were both maintained in most jawed vertebrate species . Extant pMHC - II may have functions quite similar to the ancestral MHC homodimer , although with an improved capacity for A B D E F C FIGURE 13 | Probable features of the deduced ancestral pMHC homodimer . ( A ) Overall structure shown without peptide ligand . The peptide binding domain ( PDB ) consisting of two identical p domains was roughly similar to as found in extant pMHC . The orientation of the IgSF domains is very speculative , and possibly was as known for ib domains in extant pMHC ( as shown in the ﬁ gure ) or more as structures found in antibodies ( not shown ) . ( B ) The orientation of the peptide ligand probably was as in extant pMHC - II , with overhanging peptide ends and the sidechains of the P1 and P9 residues ( shown until the C b atom in black sticks format ) pointing downwards into the groove . ( C ) The p - domain helical regions were probably as in pb domains of extant pMHC - I and pMHC - II : helices H1 , H2a , H2b , and possibly H3 were separated by kinks and formed a structure curving over the b - sheet , and a cysteine at position 74 in the H2b helix participated in a disul ﬁ de bridge with the underlying b - sheet ( the b - sheet is not shown here ) . ( D ) Peptide binding residues . The groove was probably open at both sides allowing overhang of peptides as in extant pMHC - II , and important binding residues were pW60 and pN77 as in the pb domain of extant pMHC - II . Positions of the P1 / 9 pockets are indicated . ( E ) The p - domain b - sheet . As in extant pMHC , each p - domain contributed four strands of a b - sheet , with a b - bulge in b - strand S3 at positions 33 and 34 with hydrophobic sidechains pointing upward ( the p33 and p34 residues shown are just examples , as indicated by their underlining ) . As common among pa domains in extant pMHC - I and pMHC - II , and pb domains in extant pMHC - I , there was a hydrogen bond between pH3 and pD29 . ( F ) The homodimer IgSF domain presumably had a structure similar as in extant pMHC - II ia domain , with an IgSF typical core including the iC25 - iC80 cysteine bridge and the hydrophobic interacting residues iW39 and iL68 . The orientation of the S1S2 plus S5S6 loops was unusual compared to other C1 category IgSF domains and formed a structure together with a unique iW95 residue .

Structural Evolution of MHC Classes Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 621153 20 peptide editing . On the other hand , in pMHC - I a substantially different peptide binding mode was created , with closed grooves , a shorter distance of P1 - P9 binding , and a soluble ia ( b 2 - m ) domain . Probably , similar to the evolution of the MHC - II peptide editing system ( 12 , 15 , 56 , 82 , 83 ) , the HC + b 2 - m system was developed to more strictly select only a subset of possible peptide ligands . Laws of thermodynamics conclude that synergistic binding of peptides to HC and its non - stably associated heterodimer partner b 2 - m ( 84 , 85 ) should select for higher af ﬁ nity peptides than in an imaginary situation with a similar but stable peptide - receptive MHC ( e . g . , imaginary covalent HC + b 2 - m ) complex ( three non - stably associated units have a stronger tendency to dissociate than two ) . Furthermore , closing of the grooves at the P1 and P9 pocket ends in MHC - I , compared to an open groove in the MHC - II - like ancestral situation , caused a major restriction to the lengths of peptides that could be bound . Additionally , the MHC - I groove acquired unfavorable properties for a stretched polyproline - type peptide conformation of most peptide ligands , resulting in the bulging of these peptides in individual ways ( Figure 6A ) ( e . g . , 70 , 72 , 86 ) . Such individual bulging can structurally amplify peptide ligand sequence differences ( 87 ) and in case of tumor cells that probably makes it easier for T cells to distinguish between pMHC - I complexes with peptide ligands that differ in only single residues , even if the sidechains of those residue are not exposed at the pMHC - I surface . Considering these arguments , we speculate that the pMHC - I peptide binding mode has been developed to structurally maximize small sequence differences in peptide ligands so that it is better equipped to also recognize tumor antigens . In addition , the increased selectivity for peptide ends by having a closed groove such as in MHC - I , may have improved the ability of the immune system to distinguish between peptides generated by the different peptidase activities of proteasomes versus immunoproteasomes ( 88 ) , and thus between homeostasis and in ﬂ ammation conditions . After MHC - I was established , it has been superior compared to MHC - II as a source for creating a wide array of divergent nonclassical MHC molecules ( e . g . , 25 , 89 ) , which might be explained by the covalent association of the pa and pb domains providing a stabler situation for making functional changes . Given this superior plasticity of MHC - I , it is puzzling why most species still have MHC - II . We speculate that in unstable / variable endocytic / phagocytic compartments , where classical MHC - II molecules are loaded with peptides , the seemingly simple and robust classical MHC - II loading system ( 90 ) has advantages over the classical MHC - I loading system which — at least for the initial loading with peptide — requires free b 2 - m and multiple other factors ( 2 ) . It probably would be dif ﬁ cult to deliver the different molecules of the MHC - I loading system in proper stoichiometry to the variable endocytic / phagocytic compartments , and the system might also be susceptible to the biochemical variations in those compartments . That the classical MHC - I loading system in mammals and ﬁ shes is similar is suggested by the conservation of relevant genes ( 91 – 93 ) . It has been argued that the presence of classical MHC - I genes on human Chr . 6 and of a nonclassical MHC - I gene ( encoding FcRn ) on human Chr . 19 suggest that MHC - I is older than MHC - II ( 26 ) . This hypothesis is based on a model , from a time before whole genome sequences were known , that these human chromosomal regions are paralogues deriving from a whole genome duplication very early in vertebrate evolution ( 94 ) . However , previously , we have shown that the corresponding genomic regions are linked in teleost ﬁ shes , so that many similarities between the regions may have derived from tandem gene duplications and intrachromosomal rearrangements occurring before the separation between Actinopterygii ( ray - ﬁ nned - ﬁ shes ) and Sarcopterygii , which then in the tetrapod lineage were separated by an interchromosomal translocation event ( 95 ) . Moreover , the FcRn lineage probably only separated from the classical MHC - I lineage within tetrapod evolution ( 14 ) and , in our opinion , FcRn is not a candidate for representing MHC molecules that predated the I - II divide . With the ﬁ nding of the natural MHC II a - II b fusions in lung ﬁ sh , which we designated MHC - IIabSol , the present study provides evidence that nature allows structures other than — complete or partial — consensus MHC - I or MHC - II organizations . Although the MHC - IIabSol sequences are very different from the classical MHC - II sequences in lung ﬁ shes , they probably were established from duplicates of classical MHC - II genes within Sarcopterygii or even within Dipnomorpha ( lung ﬁ shes ) ( Supplementary File 4 ) . Thus , these fusions represent a principle of how MHC - II exons can be combined for encoding larger structures , although we do not propose lung ﬁ sh MHC - IIabSol itself to belong to an MHC lineage that predated the I - II divide . Whether the exon shuf ﬂ ing events for the evolutionary creation of MHC - I genes from an MHC - II - like origin were similar totheoriginalmodelproposedbyKaufmanetal . ( 20 ) ( Figure1 ) or involved a II a - II b fusion as hypothesized in our Figure 12 model , can ’ t be determined . In short , the present study provides structural and genetic support for the II - I model of MHC evolution , identi ﬁ ed critical evolutionary events , and recognized a large set of characteristic features — some of which for the ﬁ rst time — in especially pMHC - I . Future studies should use these insights to further unravel MHC functions and mechanisms .
