Wizard of Oz Studies in HRI : A Systematic Review and New Reporting Guidelines Laurel D . Riek University of Notre Dame Many researchers use Wizard of Oz ( WoZ ) as an experimental technique , but there are methodologi - cal concerns over its use , and no comprehensive criteria on how to best employ it . We systematically review 54 WoZ experiments published in the primary HRI publication venues from 2001 - 2011 . Us - ing criteria proposed by Fraser and Gilbert ( 1991 ) , Green et al . ( 2004 ) , Steinfeld et al . ( 2009 ) , and Kelley ( 1984 ) , we analyzed how researchers conducted HRI WoZ experiments . Researchers mainly used WoZ for verbal ( 72 . 2 % ) and non - verbal ( 48 . 1 % ) processing . Most constrained wizard produc - tion ( 90 . 7 % ) , but few constrained wizard recognition ( 11 % ) . Few reported measuring wizard error ( 3 . 7 % ) , and few reported pre - experiment wizard training ( 5 . 4 % ) . Few reported using WoZ in an iterative manner ( 24 . 1 % ) . Based on these results we propose new reporting guidelines to aid future research . Keywords : Wizard of Oz , human - robot interaction , systematic review , reporting guidelines , method - ology 1 . Introduction As robots move more toward being “in the loop” and having increased autonomy in their interactions with humans , it is important that Human - Robot Interaction ( HRI ) practitioners and researchers are employing scientiﬁcally rigorous practices during the robot design lifecycle . One commonly employed technique in the HRI researchers’ toolkit is the Wizard - of - Oz ( WoZ ) technique ( Kelley , 1984 ) . WoZ refers to a person ( usually the experimenter , or a confederate ) re - motely operating a robot , controlling any of a number of things , such as its movement , navigation , speech , gestures , etc . WoZ may involve any amount of control along the autonomy spectrum , from fully autonomous to fully tele - operated , as well as mixed initiative interaction . Researchers who employ WoZ argue that because robots are not sufﬁciently advanced to interact autonomously with people in socially appropriate or physically safe ways , this kind of puppeteering allows participants to envision what future interaction could be like . They also might use it to test out early aspects of their design that have yet to be fully implemented , as part of an iterative design process . However , some researchers have raised methodological concerns regarding the use of this tech - nique . For social interaction , Weiss ( 2010 ) suggests that a WoZ controlled robot is serving more as a proxy for a human and less as an independent entity . Thus , it is not really human - robot interaction so much as human - human interaction via a robot .

Others have raised ethical concerns about the use of WoZ and social deception . Fraser and Gilbert ( 1991 ) discusses participant gullibility , and subsequent embarrassment , over ﬁnding out they have been deceived . Fraser and Gilbert ( 1991 ) also discuss ethical conundrums faced by the exper - imenter in terms of how to mitigate the necessity of deceiving a participant to keep the simulation realistic against the act of deception . Riek and Watson ( 2010 ) and Miller ( 2010 ) also suggest ethical problems when participants can not tell whom or what they are interacting with - a particular human , a human masquerading as another human , or a machine . ( Miller refers to these as “Turing Deceptions” ) . In the UK , the funding agency EPSRC drafted ethical rules for robots , and went so as far to state that users should always be able to “lift the curtain , ” since robot intelligence is , currently , an illusion ( EPSRC , 2011 ) . From an engineering perspective , Breazeal et al . ( 2005 ) suggest that relying on WoZ as an experimental technique can make it all the more difﬁcult to build robots capable of successfully mitigating errors on their own in the future ( Breazeal , Kidd , Thomaz , Hoffman , & Berlin , 2005 ) . One way to mitigate these methodological , ethical , and engineering concerns is to design exper - iments that employ WoZ in a rigorous and repeatable manner , allowing for a smoother transition to a more autonomous and capable system in the future . In the ﬁeld of HRI we traditionally have not had explicit criteria to guide us in this task , but the Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) community does . According to Fraser and Gilbert ( 1991 ) , to conduct a valid WoZ simulation the following requirements must be met : 1 . “It must be possible to simulate the future system , given human limitations ; ” 2 . “It must be possible to specify the future system’s behavior ; ” 3 . “It must be possible to make the simulation convincing . ” Fraser and Gilbert ( 1991 ) discuss controlling for various aspects of the Wizard’s behavior , such as Wizard recognition variables ( i . e . , is the Wizard perfect ? How is error controlled for ? ) , Wizard production variables ( i . e . , how fast should the Wizard respond ? ) , and Wizard training ( i . e . , giving 120 L . D . Riek , Wizard of Oz Studies in HRI : A Systematic Review and New Reporting Guidelines the Wizard enough training time to be as similar as possible to the envisioned autonomous sys - tem ) . While Fraser and Gilbert ( 1991 ) suggested these requirements in the context of non - embodied speech and dialogue systems , they are very applicable HRI WoZ systems as well . Another important consideration for WoZ experiments is to employ the use of scenarios to place additional constraints on the study . Dahlb¨ack et al . ( 1993 ) and Fraser and Gilbert ( 1991 ) stress the importance of scenario constraints for NLP WoZ experiments , as do Green , H¨uttenrauch , and Eklundh ( 2004 ) for HRI . This allows researchers to provide participants with “a task to solve whose solution requires the use of the system , but where there does not exist one single correct answer , and / or where there is more than one way to reach the goal” ( D¨ahlback , J¨onsson , & Ahrenberg , 1993 ) . Thus , Green et al . ( 2004 ) suggest the following method for WoZ HRI scenario construction : User instruction gives information to the user to help them perform the intended task . ( i . e . , “What should the user do ? ” ) Behavior hypotheses reﬂects the designer’s beliefs about users actions within the sce - nario . ( i . e . , “What will the user do ? ” ) Robot behavior speciﬁes what the robot will do , for any level of autonomy . ( i . e . , “What should the robot do ? ” ) Steinfeld , Jenkins , and Scassellati ( 2009 ) argue that it is important for WoZ studies to also take into account how the environment can affect both the robot and the human , how the level of auton - omy of the robot can affect how humans control it , and , in some cases , how to model , simulate and otherwise account for the actions of the Wizard . Thus , one may need to design studies that employ one or more human or robot centric ex - perimental techniques throughout the design lifecycle , including not only Wizard of Oz , but also Wizard with Oz ( human - centric method that uses real technology in a simulated environment ) , Wiz - ard and Oz ( human - centric method that uses real technology in a real environment ) , Oz with Wizard ( robot - centric method that includes humans but doesn’t measure them ) , Oz of Wizard ( robot - centric method where humans are either simulated or minimally involved ) , and Wizard nor Oz ( all aspects of the system are simulated ) . Finally , returning to the original article by Kelley ( 1984 ) who ﬁrst introduced the WoZ technique to the usability community , iteration is a key component of valid design . A single WoZ simulation was not intended to be the end point of a research question , but part of an iterative process in which the Wizard is gradually phased out of the communication loop and autonomy is phased in ( Kelley , 1984 ) . Thus , it is with the WoZ methodological criteria proposed by Fraser and Gilbert ( 1991 ) , Green et al . ( 2004 ) , Steinfeld et al . ( 2009 ) , and Kelley ( 1984 ) that we perform a systematic review of the HRI literature to synthesize existing evidence of how researchers are currently designing and conducting WoZ studies . A systematic review “involves the application of scientiﬁc strategies , in ways that limit bias , to the assembly , critical appraisal , and synthesis of all relevant studies that address a speciﬁc . . . question” ( Cook , Mulrow , & Haynes , 1997 ) . Section 2 of this paper describes our review protocol and methodology , Section 3 describes our results , and Section 4 discusses the implications of these results for the HRI community and proposes new reporting guidelines to guide future research with WoZ . 2 . Review Protocol We searched the ACM Digital Library ( ACM , 2012 ) and IEEExplore ( IEEE , 2012 ) , as these include the major peer - reviewed HRI and general robotics publication venues . While there are several HRI 121 L . D . Riek , Wizard of Oz Studies in HRI : A Systematic Review and New Reporting Guidelines Table 1 : Literature review search strategy . Search Terms Source Publications ( “wizard of oz” OR WoZ ) AND “human robot interaction” AND ( experiment OR “user study” OR pilot ) ACM International Conference on Human Robot Interaction ( HRI ) IEEE / RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems ( IROS ) IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation ( ICRA ) IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Inter - active Communication ( RO - MAN ) IEEE Transactions on Systems , Man , and Cybernetics ( SMC ) IEEE Transactions on Robotics ( TRO ) publication venues not indexed by ACM or IEEE , for example Interaction Studies and The Journal of Social Robotics , it was necessary to constrain the search space , so they were not included in this review . The publications we included and the search terms used are detailed in Table 1 . We included papers in this systematic review that ( 1 ) had been published in a peer - reviewed conference or journal , ( 2 ) included at least one physically embodied robot that interacted with at least one human participant , and ( 3 ) described an experiment or user study that included ﬁve or more participants . This review excluded unpublished or non - peer - reviewed manuscripts , book chapters , posters , talks , demonstrations , exhibits , videos , and abstracts . We also excluded “lightly peer reviewed” publications , such as HRI Late Breaking Reports and CHI Extended Abstracts . Any papers published before 2001 were also excluded from the search . Since robotics as a discipline advances so rapidly , studies published before 2001 may not reﬂect the state of the art in terms of robot capability . Papers that solely described simulated platforms or virtual avatars were excluded from this re - view , as well as any papers that only referenced or alluded to a WoZ study or experiment but did not actually describe one . Finally , if an author reported the exact same study or experiment in two or more different papers , only one paper was included and the others were excluded . 3 . Results 3 . 1 General Paper Demographics The original search returned 177 results . After removing duplicates across the two databases and applying the exclusion criteria , 54 papers were included in the analysis . The included papers were published from 2003 - 2011 , the mode being 2009 . Figure 2 depicts the major publication venues . IEEE RO - MAN and ACM HRI were the ma - jor venues the included studies appeared in at 38 % and 32 % respectively . The other major IEEE 122 L . D . Riek , Wizard of Oz Studies in HRI : A Systematic Review and New Reporting Guidelines Figure 2 . Pie chart showing the distribution of included WoZ articles in this review . Seventy percent ap - peared in proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Human - Robot Interaction ( HRI ) and IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication ( RO - MAN ) . Robotics Conferences ( Humanoids , ICRA , IROS , and ICORR ) held 13 % of the publications . Only 5 % of the included studies appeared in IEEE robotics journals ( T - RO and SMC Part II ) . The remain - ing 12 % of publications appeared in other ACM and IEEE conferences , such as OZCHI , Creativity and Cognition , etc . Figure 3 depicts the types of robots used across the 54 papers . 4 papers used androids ( e . g . , Repilee ) , 18 papers used humanoids ( e . g . , NAO ) , 3 papers used both humanoids and mechanical - looking robots ( e . g . , Robovie and a Cart robot ) , 20 used mechanical - looking robots ( e . g . , Pioneer 3AT ) , and 9 used zoomorphic robots ( e . g . , Pleo ) . The number of participants in the studies / experiments ranged from 5 to 159 ; the mean was 37 . 96 ( s . d . = 39 ) . If a paper contained more than one experiment / study that met the inclusion criteria , the participant counts were summed . 3 . 2 Types of Wizard control Figure 4 displays the types of Wizard control employed across the 54 papers . Some papers described using more than one type of control . 3 . 2 . 1 Natural language processing . In 72 . 2 % of papers ( n = 39 ) , authors reported using Natu - ral Language Processing as a component controlled by a Wizard . For example , having the robot appropriately respond to things the user said to it , making utterances , etc . 3 . 2 . 2 Nonverbal behavior . In 48 . 1 % of papers ( n = 26 ) , authors reported having the Wizard make the robot generate some sort of visible utterance ( i . e . , non - verbal behavior ) . For example , making the robot nod its head , point , ﬁx its gaze upon a user , etc . 123 L . D . Riek , Wizard of Oz Studies in HRI : A Systematic Review and New Reporting Guidelines Figure 3 .

Chart depicting the types of Wizard control employed in the included papers . Some papers described using more than one type of control . 124 L . D . Riek , Wizard of Oz Studies in HRI : A Systematic Review and New Reporting Guidelines 3 . 2 . 3 Navigation and mobility . In 29 . 6 % of papers ( n = 16 ) , authors reported having the Wizard perform navigation and mobility tasks . For example , positioning the robot at a particular stage of the experiment . 3 . 2 . 4 Manipulation . In 3 . 7 % of papers ( n = 2 ) , authors reported having the Wizard perform ma - nipulation tasks . Ralph and Moussa ( 2008 ) describe a task where the Wizard takes both user’s commands and the robot’s limitations into account when selecting commands for it ; Robins et al . ( 2008 ) describe a Wizard controlling a 3 - DOF drumming robot . 3 . 2 . 5 Sensing . In 1 . 9 % of papers ( n = 1 ) , authors reported having the Wizard do sensing for the robot . This sensing component was part of a semi - autonomous system Yamaoka et al . ( 2010 ) described for visual object selection . 3 . 2 . 6 Mapping and / or localization . In 1 . 9 % of papers ( n = 1 ) , authors reported having the Wizard do mapping and / or localization for the robot . Fischer ( 2011 ) described using a Wizard to localize a robotic wheelchair for a user . 3 . 3 Fraser and Gilbert ( 1991 ) Criteria 3 . 3 . 1 Possible to simulate the future system , given human limitations . In 92 . 6 % of included papers ( n = 41 ) , authors clearly articulated that the component ( s ) of the system being WoZ controlled was feasible to simulate , meaning either the component could be realized in the near future , or else it was within the realm of something a human could do . For example , Okita and Sarvadevabhatla ( 2009 ) describe using a Wizard to simulate speech recognition for children interacting with ASIMO , as robust child - speech recognition is still in its infancy . 3 . 3 . 2 Possible to specify the future system’s behavior . In 94 . 4 % of included papers ( n = 51 ) , au - thors clearly articulated that the component ( s ) of the system being WoZ controlled was speciﬁable , meaning the researchers formulated a detailed speciﬁcation of the future system’s behavior . Some went as far to state this explicitly in the Methodology section of their paper , for example , Burghart et al . ( 2007 ) wrote , “While the studies presented in this work have been conducted as a Wizard - of - Oz experiment , the functionality of the system has been designed to match the functionality that can be developed with a standalone system” ( Burghart , Holzapfel , Haeussling , & Breuer , 2007 ) . 3 . 3 . 3 Constrained Wizard recognition ability . Only 11 % of included papers ( n = 6 ) described con - trolling what the Wizard could recognize and perceive in the interaction . For example , Shiomi et al . ( 2008 ) describe a semi - autonomous robot at a train station . The Wizard only intervenes in interaction when the autonomous system requests it , and furthermore , “does not listen to the inter - action unless the robot asks for help so that [ the wizards ] could fairly well observe whether [ their ] semi - autonomous [ system ] works . ” In 81 . 5 % of included papers ( n = 44 ) , authors did not control for what the Wizard could recognize during the interaction . Thus , the Wizard had a perfect audio and / or video feed from the experiment , the data sent to the Wizard was not explicitly delayed , etc . 3 . 3 . 4 Constrained Wizard production ability and Wizard errors . Although 90 . 7 % of included pa - pers ( n = 49 ) described controlling for what constraints the Wizard had while operating the robot , only 3 . 7 % ( n = 2 ) of included papers clearly described the Wizard deliberately making errors when controlling the robot , and only 3 . 7 % ( n = 2 ) of papers measured or discussed accidental Wizard er - rors . ( These four papers were different ) . No papers described actually controlling for Wizard error , deliberate or otherwise . 125 L . D . Riek , Wizard of Oz Studies in HRI : A Systematic Review and New Reporting Guidelines One example of deliberate Wizard errors : Tanaka et al . ( 2007 ) describe an experiment where a Wizard controlled an AIBO to half the time behave randomly , mimicking a “before learning phase , ” and the other half of the time behave correctly only 80 % of the time , mimicking a “during - learning phase” . And one example of measuring Wizard error : Shiwa et al . ( 2008 ) describe sampling 237 experimental trials to measure Wizard error and found very few . Only 1 . 9 % of included papers ( n = 1 ) explicitly stated the authors did not control for Wizard production ability , and 7 . 4 % of papers ( n = 4 ) did not provide sufﬁcient detail to make an assessment . 3 . 3 . 5 Provided training to Wizards . Only 5 . 4 % of included papers ( n = 3 ) described providing the Wizard training . Ralph and Moussa ( 2008 ) provided their Wizard two months of training prior to beginning their experiment , to ensure that the Wizard “did not inﬂuence each participant’s choice of language or commands used during the study . ” The remaining 94 . 4 % of papers ( n = 51 ) did not provide sufﬁcient detail about Wizard training to make this assessment . Thus , it is not clear whether such training took place . 3 . 3 . 6 Possible to make the simulation convincing . In 72 . 2 % of included papers ( n = 39 ) , authors clearly articulated that the component ( s ) of the system being WoZ controlled was convincing to participants , meaning that the illusion of interacting with an autonomous robot was maintained . For instance , a few papers described ways in which they simulated robot response lag time ; Funakoshi et al . ( 2008 ) inserted random , system - level communication delays between 0 and 15 seconds to both the Wizard and the User throughout their experiment . Other researchers employed scenario constraints to immerse users in the experiment , see Section 3 . 4 . 1 for more details . The remaining 27 . 8 % of included papers ( n = 15 ) did not provide sufﬁcient detail to make this assessment . Thus , it is not clear if their WoZ simulations were convincing to participants . 3 . 4 Green et al . ( 2004 ) Criteria 3 . 4 . 1 Speciﬁed user instruction . In 94 . 4 % of included papers ( n = 51 ) , authors clearly speciﬁed what the users could do during the interaction and / or gave them a clear scenario . For example , Siino et al . ( 2008 ) gave participants a scenario where they were on a futuristic spaceship and had to command a robot to help them perform repairs to the life support system . 3 . 4 . 2 Speciﬁed behavior hypotheses . In 79 . 6 % ( n = 43 ) of included papers , authors clearly spec - iﬁed their hypotheses for user behavior during the interaction . For example , Kim et al . ( 2009 ) test three behavioral hypotheses for users interacting with a Pleo robot in terms of their affective vocalizations . The remaining 20 . 4 % ( n = 11 ) of included papers did not clearly state their behavioral hypotheses for users , or otherwise did not provide sufﬁcient detail to make this assessment . 3 . 4 . 3 Speciﬁed robot behavior . In 98 . 1 % ( n = 53 ) of included papers , authors clearly speciﬁed the robot’s behavior during the interaction . For example , Heerink et al . ( 2006 ) described the com - municative scripts they developed for their iCat robot and detailed its social expressivity , including smiling , attentive listening , and so on . 3 . 5 Kelley ( 1984 ) Criteria In only 24 . 1 % ( n = 13 ) of included papers did authors clearly articulate that their use of WoZ was part of an iterative design process . For example , Lee et al . ( 2009 ) describe several prototype iterations as they developed Snackbot , using WoZ in early parts of their process . 126 L . D . Riek , Wizard of Oz Studies in HRI : A Systematic Review and New Reporting Guidelines Figure 5 . Pie chart depicting the types of WoZ models used across the 54 included papers . Of the remaining 75 . 9 % ( n = 41 ) of included papers authors did not provide sufﬁcient detail to make this assessment . Thus , it is unclear if they were utilizing WoZ in an iterative way . 3 . 6 Steinfeld et al . ( 2009 ) Criteria Figure 5 displays the types of WoZ models used across the 54 included papers . In 68 . 5 % of included papers ( n = 37 ) , authors described employing the Wizard of Oz model , wherein the robot behavior is simulated and the researcher is primarily interested in measuring how the user interacts with the robot , not measuring the robot itself . In this model , frequently realistic robot behavior “can be estimated but may not be realized until years of technology advances have occurred” ( Ste - infeld et al . , 2009 ) . This model might be described as “human - centric , ” on one extreme of the WoZ experimental spectrum . In 14 . 8 % of papers ( n = 8 ) , authors described employing the Wizard with Oz model , a human - centric method that uses real technology , but within simulated or controlled environments , such as a laboratory . For example , Ryokai et al . ( 2009 ) test physical and digital authoring languages for children to do storytelling on a Pleo robot , and ran their study in a controlled playspace in their lab . In 7 . 4 % of papers ( n = 4 ) , authors described employing the Wizard and Oz model , a human - centric method that uses real technology in a real environment . For example , Iwamura et al . ( 2011 ) conducted a ﬁeld experiment in a supermarket with a semi - autonomous robot that provides shopping assistance to older adults . They suggest their robot can be fully autonomous in the near future . In 7 . 4 % of papers ( n = 4 ) , authors described employing the Oz with Wizard model , a robot - centric method where users are involved in a WoZ experiment but not precisely measured . For example , Noda et al . ( 2007 ) describe an experiment testing a haptic interaction classiﬁcation method at the Osaka Science Museum , allowing participants to freely interact with their robot . The participants themselves are not measured , but how robot classiﬁes their actions is . In 1 . 9 % of papers ( n = 1 ) , authors described employing the Oz of Wizard model , a robot - centric 127 L . D . Riek , Wizard of Oz Studies in HRI : A Systematic Review and New Reporting Guidelines method focused on “advancing enabling technologies . ” In this model , the user is simulated ( or min - imally involved ) , and their performance is tightly intertwined ultimately with system performance . No studies employed the Wizard Nor Oz model , a method in which all aspects of the system are simulated . This is explained by the fact that our inclusion criteria explicitly speciﬁed a physically embodied robot interacting with a real human . 4 . Discussion 4 . 1 How WoZ is currently used in HRI research 4 . 1 . 1 Types of wizard control . For the papers included in this review , HRI researchers used WoZ primarily for natural language processing and non - verbal behavior simulation ( 72 . 2 % and 48 . 1 % respectively ) . Wizards also often performed navigation and mobility tasks ( 29 . 6 % ) ; while manipu - lation , sensing , and mapping simulations were far less commonly employed ( 3 . 9 % , 1 . 9 % , and 1 . 9 % respectively ) . This usage pattern suggests that the truly “hard problems” in HRI still lie in verbal and visual human language understanding , requiring the use of a Wizard . Lee ( 2003 ) suggested that natural language processing is “AI - complete” , meaning that it is one of the most challenging problems in artiﬁcial intelligence . This sentiment has recently been echoed by Picard ( 2009a , 2009b ) , a pioneer in affective computing , who stated that machine understanding of facial expressions alone is one of the hardest , most complex problems in computer science . Thus , we will likely see Wizards being used for these tasks for the foreseeable future . 4 . 1 . 2 Fraser and Gilbert ( 1991 ) criteria . Generally , authors clearly articulated that their WoZ simulation was feasible to simulate ( 92 . 6 % ) , convincing ( 72 . 2 % ) , and speciﬁable ( 94 . 4 % ) . However , given the majority of papers used WoZ for fairly complex verbal and visual human language understanding , it is unclear if these systems were truly speciﬁable . While the majority of papers constrained what the Wizard could produce ( 90 . 7 % ) , very few constrained what the Wizard could recognize ( 11 % ) . Further , of those papers that did constrain Wizard production , very few researchers had Wizards deliberately make machinelike errors simulating a future system ( 3 . 7 % ) , and very few actually measured Wizard error ( 3 . 7 % ) . However , even if an HRI researcher creates recognition constraints and deliberate production errors for a Wizard , a savvy Wizard ( and User ) could likely overcome them . For example , even with simulating an occluded visual sensor , a degraded audio signal , and system lag , a Wizard could still ‘thin slice’ the situation to know what action to take ( Ambady & Rosenthal , 1992 ) , whereas this would be an incredibly difﬁcult , if not impossible feat for a robot ( Riek & Robinson , 2011 ) . Nonetheless , controlled Wizard recognition and production errors could still help to address some of the aforementioned WoZ methodological concerns . Another way researchers can ensure a speciﬁable system is to provide sufﬁcient training to their Wizards . Only 3 papers ( 5 . 4 % ) actually described Wizard training ; it is unclear if the experiments from the other 51 papers actually provided training , or if it was in any way controlled or considered by the researchers . It is also not clear what the Wizards knew in advance of the experiment in terms of its hypotheses , robot behavioral expectations , etc . These too may be inﬂuencing the experimental results . 4 . 1 . 3 Green et al . ( 2004 ) criteria . Overall , the included papers followed criteria by Green et al . ( 2004 ) closely , by specifying what users could do during the interaction and providing them with a clear scenario ( 94 . 4 % ) , specifying their behavioral hypotheses for the user ( 79 . 6 % ) and for the robot ( 98 . 1 % ) . 128 L . D . Riek , Wizard of Oz Studies in HRI : A Systematic Review and New Reporting Guidelines It would be helpful if authors were more explicit about their behavioral hypotheses or predictions of the user , as often this was not easy to determine , particularly in the robot - centric papers . This lack of clear reporting makes future replication more difﬁcult . 4 . 1 . 4 Kelley ( 1984 ) criteria . Only a quarter of papers ( 24 . 1 % ) clearly described their WoZ simula - tion as being part of an iterative design process . It is unclear from the remaining papers if researchers were indeed performing iterative WoZ simulations and just not describing doing so , or if they were declaring their reported results as ﬁnal . Also , authors did not always mention their use of WoZ as a limitation when reporting their results . One thing that would be helpful is for authors to clearly sketch out their iterative plans for using WoZ control for their robot . Doing so would help other HRI researchers either replicate or carry on the work . Also , it would be useful for authors to mention the limitations of their results , given they are a part of an iterative methodology . 4 . 1 . 5 Steinfeld et al . ( 2009 ) criteria . Authors predominantly used the Wizard of Oz model ( 68 . 5 % ) , a human - centric method using possibly very futuristic technological simulation on the robot . This is unsurprising given the majority of papers using WoZ control for human language understanding . Only 7 . 4 % of papers employed the Wizard and Oz model , a human - centric method that uses real technology in a real environment . This is unfortunate given Steinfeld et al . suggest this is the ‘preferred method’ of all six types of WoZ simulations ( Steinfeld et al . , 2009 ) . However , given the inherent challenges in conducting real - world HRI studies with real robots ( Burke et al . , 2011 ) , it is not surprising . 4 . 2 Limitations and Future Work This systematic review has a few limitations . First , due to the fact that the review spanned a decade of literature , a few tradeoffs had to be made regarding inclusion criteria . By only including ACM and IEEE peer - reviewed publications , we excluded papers from other venues that publishes HRI work in our community , such as publications from professional societies such as the Ameri - can Association for the Advancement of Artiﬁcial Intelligence ( AAAI ) and the Human Factors and Ergonomic Society ( HFES ) , as well as journals such as the Journal on Social Robotics and the In - teraction Studies Journal . A broader search may have yielded different ﬁndings , and is a reasonable next step for future work in this area . Secondly , by only including publications written in English , we may have excluded relevant publications from other countries’ professional societies and journals that publish HRI work in other languages . Hopefully HRI researchers who speak these other languages ﬂuently can replicate this systematic review and include those publication venues to see if the same trends appear there . Third , with regard to the Steinfeld et al . criteria , the use of the term “Wizard of Oz” in our initial search may have inadvertently biased our selection against “Oz of Wizard” papers . Papers of this sort ( primarily robot - centric ) are less likely to use the term “Wizard of Oz . ” In the future , a broader search which includes more keywords robot - centric papers are likely to use ( e . g . , “remote operator” ) would help address this . Finally , these ﬁndings will be most applicable to those who wish to contribute generalizable knowledge to the HRI community through the use of WoZ as an experimental technique . For those researchers who only intend to use WoZ as an early protoyping design technique , where unscripted , uncontrolled wizard operation is acceptable , these ﬁndings may be less applicable . 129 L .

Riek , Wizard of Oz Studies in HRI : A Systematic Review and New Reporting Guidelines 4 . 3 New WoZ reporting guidelines for HRI In the ﬁeld of biomedical research , reporting guidelines “specify a minimum set of items re - quired for a clear and transparent account of what was done and what was found in a research study , reﬂecting , in particular , issues that might introduce bias into the research” ( U . S . National Library of Medicine , 2011 ) . Thus , in order to encourage easy replication and peer - assessment of WoZ studies , we suggest the following reporting guidelines , shown in Table 2 . These guidelines are based on our results as well as the aforementioned WoZ and HRI literature . Though it is not critical that every single HRI WoZ paper details every single one of these criteria , it will be helpful if researchers at least carefully consider these questions . The table is divided up into four experimental components ( Robot , User , Wizard , and General ) , each with afﬁliated questions to motivate thinking about the topic . The Robot component asks questions about which robots were used , their capabilities , and the researcher’s predictions for what the robot will do during the experiment . These questions were primarily motivated by Green et al . ( 2004 ) . The User component asks questions about the users interacting with the robot , and includes questions regarding their demographics , the instructions they were provided , experimental hypothe - ses about their behavior , the user’s expectations about the robot , and the user’s perceptions of the WoZ simulation . These questions were motivated by Green et al . ( 2004 ) , Dahlb ¨ ack et al . ( 1993 ) , Fraser and Gilbert ( 1991 ) , and Lohse ( 2010 ) . Next , the Wizard component asks questions about the Wizard operating the robot , and includes questions concerning the wizard’s demographics , prior knowledge of the experimental hypotheses , identiﬁcation and control of wizard production / recognition variables , how the researcher controlled wizard errors , and quantity and type of training the wizard received . These questions were motivated by Fraser and Gilbert ( 1991 ) and Steinfeld et al . ( 2009 ) . Finally , the General section includes questions regarding the experimental environment , experi - mental scenarios , whether the experiment was part of an iterative design process , and , ﬁnally , if the paper discussed the limitations of using WoZ . These questions were motivated by Kelley ( 1984 ) , Fraser and Gilbert ( 1991 ) , Green et al . ( 2004 ) , Dahlb ¨ ack et al . ( 1993 ) , and Steinfeld et al . ( 2009 ) . 4 . 4 Summary We presented a systematic review of the HRI literature between 2001 - 2011 that included the use of the WoZ experimental technique . Using methodological criteria proposed by Fraser and Gilbert ( 1991 ) , Green et al . ( 2004 ) , Steinfeld et al . ( 2009 ) , and Kelley ( 1984 ) , 54 papers were analyzed on how they controlled for various aspects of system speciﬁcation and experimental design , as well as how clearly they presented their results to the scientiﬁc community . Our key ﬁndings are summarized below : Types of Wizard control . The majority of experiments used a Wizard to control for natural language ( 72 . 2 % ) and non - verbal behavioral ( 48 . 1 % ) processing . Wizards also often performed nav - igation and mobility tasks ( 29 . 6 % ) ; while manipulation , sensing , and mapping simulations were far less commonly employed . Wizard constraints and training . Most papers reported constraining what Wizards could produce on the robot ( 90 . 7 % ) , but very few reported constraining what the Wizard could recognize ( 11 % ) . Even fewer papers reported measuring Wizard error ( 3 . 7 % ) , and few described giving the Wizards training before the experiment ( 5 . 4 % ) . 131 L . D . Riek , Wizard of Oz Studies in HRI : A Systematic Review and New Reporting Guidelines User scenario constraints . Most papers clearly speciﬁed giving users a scenario , as well as speci - fying both their user and robot behavioral hypotheses . WoZ paradigms employed . Authors predominantly used the Wizard of Oz model ( 68 . 5 % ) , a human - centric method using possibly very futuristic technological simulation on the robot ; only 7 . 4 % used the preferred Wizard and Oz model , a human - centric method using real technology in a real environment . Iterative design . Only a quarter of included papers clearly mentioned their use of WoZ was part of an iterative design process . Based on these ﬁndings , we presented new reporting guidelines with the aim of guiding re - searchers toward more rigorous means of conducting and reporting HRI WoZ experiments , ideally helping circumvent the existing methodological concerns surrounding this methodology .
