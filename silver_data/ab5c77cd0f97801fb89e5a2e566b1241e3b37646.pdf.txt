For example , shareholders of large corporations often need to motivate managers to pursue more innovative business strategies . This paper shows that the opti - mal incentive scheme that motivates innovation exhibits substantial tolerance ( or even reward ) for early failure and reward for long - term success . Moreover , com - mitment to a long - term compensation plan , job security , and timely feedback on performance are also essential ingredients to motivate innovation . In the context of managerial compensation , the optimal incentive scheme that motivates inno - vation can be implemented via a combination of stock options with long vesting periods , option repricing , golden parachutes , and managerial entrenchment . ∗ MIT Sloan School of Management , 50 Memorial Dr E52 - 446 , Cambridge , MA 02142 ( e - mail : manso @ mit . edu , url : www . mit . edu / ∼ manso / ) .

Electronic copy available at : http : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 891514 Electronic copy available at : http : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 891514 Berle and Means’ ( 1932 ) seminal contribution brought to light the potential draw - backs produced by the separation of ownership and control . For example , in large corporations , shareholders delegate decision rights to a manager , who has the ability to manage resources to his own advantage . To alleviate possible conﬂicts of interest between shareholders and managers , incentive plans that align their interests are commonly used in practice . A large subsequent literature , which includes Harris and Raviv ( 1978 ) and Holmstrom ( 1979 ) , has developed principal - agent models to study this issue . In these models , the principal oﬀers the agent an incentive plan to induce the agent to act in the principal’s best interest . Most of the papers in this literature focus on the problem of inducing the agent to exert eﬀort or avoiding the agent from tunneling resources away from the corporation . Here I study a diﬀerent problem : how to structure incentives when the principal needs to motivate the agent to be more innovative ? Such problem arises naturally in several situations in which there is separation between ownership and control . Shareholders may need to motivate a CEO to pursue more innovative business strategies . Managers of large corporations often complain that it is hard to induce their employees to be more innovative . Regulators may want to stimulate entrepreneurship , for example , through the design of bankruptcy laws . The key contribution of the paper is to show that incentive schemes that motivate innovation should be structured diﬀerently from standard pay - for - performance schemes used to induce eﬀort or to avoid tunneling . Innovation involves the exploration of new untested approaches that are likely to fail . Therefore , standard pay - for - performance schemes that punish failures with low rewards and termination may in fact have adverse eﬀects on innovation . In contrast , the optimal incentive scheme that motivates inno - vation exhibits substantial tolerance ( or even reward ) for early failure and reward for long - term success . Under this incentive scheme , compensation depends not only on total performance , but also on the path of performance ; an agent who performs well initially 1 Electronic copy available at : http : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 891514 Electronic copy available at : http : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 891514 but poorly later earns less than an agent who performs poorly initially but well later or even an agent who performs poorly repeatedly . The paper also shows that commitment to a long - term compensation plan , job security , and timely feedback on performance are essential ingredients to motivate innovation . In the context of executive compensation , the optimal contract that motivates inno - vation can be implemented via a combination of stock options with long vesting periods , option repricing , golden parachutes , and managerial entrenchment . Stock options with long vesting periods combined with option repricing and golden parachutes bring on tol - erance for early failure and reward for long - term success , so that compensation depends not only on total performance but also on the path of performance as described above . Managerial entrenchment gives the manager job security , since an entrenched manager may keep his job even if it is ex - post eﬃcient for the shareholders of the ﬁrm to ﬁre him . In the public debate on corporate governance , golden parachutes , option repricing , and managerial entrenchment are often criticized because they protect or even reward the manager after poor performance , potentially undermining the incentives for the manager to exert eﬀort . Occasionally there are proposals to adopt regulations that restrict the use of some these practices . 1 As argued here , in some cases , these practices may be part of an optimal incentive scheme that motivates innovation and regulations that restrict their use may thus have an adverse eﬀect on innovation . In order to assess the actual impact of such regulations , it remains to be studied empirically the actual contribution of these practices to innovation as well as the value of additional investments in innovation . To model the process of innovation , I use a class of Bayesian decision models known as bandit problems . 2 In bandit problems , the agent is uncertain about the true distribution of payoﬀs of the available actions . Innovation in this setting is the discovery , through experimentation and learning , of actions that are superior to previously known actions . I focus on the central concern that arises in bandit problems : the tension between the exploration of new untested actions and the exploitation of well known actions . Explo - ration of new untested actions reveals information about potentially superior actions , 2 but is also likely to waste time with inferior actions . Exploitation of well known actions ensures reasonable payoﬀs , but may prevent the discovery of superior actions . To study the incentives for exploration and exploitation , I embed a bandit problem into a principal principal - agent framework . The principal - agent relationship could be , for example , between shareholders of a ﬁrm designing the compensation package oﬀered to a manager , the manager of a ﬁrm designing an incentive plan for a worker , or a venture capitalist ﬁnancing an entrepreneur . The model has two periods and two possible outcomes in each period ( success or failure ) . In each period the agent can choose between shirking , exploiting a well - known approach , or exploring a novel approach , which has an unknown probability of success . There are two important special cases . First , if exploration and exploitation are costless to the agent , there is no conﬂict of interest between the principal and the agent . The model then reduces to the two - armed bandit problem that captures the tension between exploration and exploitation . Second , if exploration is extremely costly to the agent , the agent chooses between exploitation or shirking . The model then reduces to a stan - dard principal - agent model where the principal must motivate the agent to exert eﬀort . Therefore , the model developed here incorporates the tension between exploration and exploitation present in bandit problems , as well as the tension between working and shirking present in standard principal - agent models . The optimal contracts that motivate exploitation and exploration are fundamen - tally diﬀerent from each other . Since exploitation is just the repetition of well known actions , the optimal contract that motivates exploitation is similar to standard pay - for - performance contracts used to motivate repeated eﬀort . On the other hand , since with exploration the agent is likely to waste time with inferior actions , the optimal contract that motivates exploration exhibits substantial tolerance ( or even reward ) for early fail - ures . Moreover , since exploration reveals information that is useful for future decisions , the optimal contract that motivates exploration rewards long - term success . 3 The threat of termination after poor performance also aﬀects the incentives for ex - ploration and exploitation . Since the threat of termination helps to prevent the agent from shirking or exploring new actions , termination facilitates the provision of incentives for exploitation . Excessive termination may thus be optimal to motivate exploitation . In contrast , the eﬀects of termination on the incentives for exploration are ambiguous . First , the threat of termination prevents the agent from shirking . Second , the threat of termination encourages the agent to exploit conventional actions . Depending on which of these two eﬀects is more important , termination may either facilitate or hinder the provision of incentives for exploration . Either excessive termination or continuation may thus be optimal to motivate exploration . The roles of feedback on performance and commitment to a long - term contract also diﬀer depending on whether the principal wants to motivate exploration or exploitation . While not important to motivate exploitation , commitment to a long - term contract and timely feedback on performance are essential to motivate exploration . The model produces testable empirical implications . For example , one can study whether incentive practices used in tasks for which motivating innovation is more ( less ) important resemble the incentive practices that , according to this paper , motivate ex - ploration ( exploitation ) . Moreover , one can study whether the adoption of incentive practices that motivate exploration ( exploitation ) indeed leads to more ( less ) innovation . I discuss later in the paper how to interpret and test these predictions in the context of executive compensation , bankruptcy laws , and intrapreneurship in large corporations . The paper is organized as follows . Section I discusses the related literature . Section II discusses the tension between exploration and exploitaiton in a single - agent decision problem . Section III introduces the tension between exploration and exploitation into a principal - agent model . Section IV studies incentives for exploration and exploitation . Section V studies implementation without commitment . Section V I studies the optimal termination policy of the principal . Section V II studies the provision of feedback . Section V III discusses empirical implications and applications of the model to corporate 4 governance and executive compensation , bankruptcy laws and entrepreneurship , and the incentives for intrapreneurship in large corporations . Section IX contains additional discussion and Section X concludes . All proofs are in the Appendix . I . Related Literature Other papers have studied the incentives for innovation from an optimal contracting perspective . Holmstrom ( 1989 ) proposes an alternative explanation for why incentives schemes that motivate innovation must exhibit tolerance for failures . He argues that performance measures for innovative activities are noisier , and therefore to motivate innovation the principal should rely on compensation schemes that are less sensitive to performance . In the same vein , Aghion and Tirole ( 1994 ) argue that the outcomes of innovation activities are unpredictable and , therefore , hard to contract ex ante . In an incomplete contract framework , they derive the optimal allocation of control rights that motivates innovation . These two papers focus on measurability and contractability aspects of the innovation activity . In contrast , the present paper models the innovation process explicitly and focuses on the central trade - oﬀ that arises in innovation activities , the trade - oﬀ between exploration and exploitation . The model of the innovation process adopted here follows a long tradition in the study of innovation . Schumpeter ( 1934 ) argues that innovation results from the experimenta - tion with “new combinations” of existing resources . Arrow ( 1969 ) associates innovation with the production of knowledge and proposes the use of Bayesian decision models to study innovation . Bandit problems are Bayesian decision models that allow for knowl - edge acquisition through experimentation . Weitzman ( 1979 ) applies a simple bandit problem to study the innovation process . March ( 1991 ) uses the terms exploration and exploitation to describe the fundamental tension that arises in learning through exper - imentation . The literature in industrial organization , including Roberts and Weitzman ( 1981 ) , Jensen ( 1981 ) , Battacharya , Chatterjee , and Samuelson ( 1986 ) , and Moscarini 5 and Smith ( 2001 ) , has relied extensively on bandit problem and related models of learn - ing through experimentation to study the innovation process . Also , recent papers on growth theory , such as Jovanovic and Rob ( 1990 ) , Jovanovic and Nyarko ( 1996 ) and Aghion ( 2002 ) , develop quite detailed models of innovation as the result of learning from the exploration of new technologies . In contrast to the above papers , which study individual decision problems , I embed bandit problems into a principal - agent framework to study incentives for exploration and exploitation . Other papers have studied principal - agent models in which the choice of the agent is not limited to the level of eﬀort . Holmstrom and Milgrom ( 1991 ) develop a multi - task principal - agent model in which the agent allocates eﬀort across multiple tasks and the principal observes a performance measure for each of these tasks . They show that in - creasing compensation in one task will cause some reallocation of attention away from other tasks , and therefore pay - for - performance contracts may not be optimal . The cur - rent model resembles the multi - task model in that the agent can choose to allocate eﬀort to exploration or exploitation and the intuition for why standard pay - for - performance is suboptimal when motivating innovation is related to the multi - task intuition . Even though the two models share some features , modeling the innovation process explicitly as a bandit problem and analyzing optimal incentives in that setting leads to richer predictions and insights about how to provide incentives for innovation . In particular , by having a dynamic model , I am able to show how the compensation of the agent de - pends not only on total performance but also on the path of performance . Moreover , the results on lack of commitment , termination , and feedback are not present in multi - task principal - agent models . The paper is also related to the managerial short - termism literature , which argues that managers are biased towards short - term projects due to career concerns ( Narayanan 1985 ) , takeover threats ( Stein 1988 ) , concerns about near - term stock prices ( Stein 1989 ) , the presence of noise traders ( Shleifer and Vishny 1990 ) , and herding behavior ( Zwiebel 1995 ) . Graham , Harvey , and Rajgopal ( 2005 ) ﬁnd , in a survey of ﬁnancial executives , 6 that the majority of managers would pass a positive NPV project to avoid missing the current quarter’s consensus earnings forecast . Using ﬁrm - level data , Dechow and Sloan ( 1991 ) and Bushee ( 1998 ) ﬁnd that short - termism is more prevalent for CEOs near retirement and in ﬁrms held by transient institutional investors . To study the ﬁnancing of innovation , Bergemann and Hege ( 2005 ) develop a principal - agent model in which there is learning about the quality of the project . The tension between exploration and exploitation does not arise in their model though , as the agent can only choose one type of project . Moreover , their paper only considers implemen - tation with a sequence of short - term contracts . Also related are Hellmann ( 2007 ) and Hellmann and Thiele ( 2008 ) , who study incentives for innovation using a multi - task principal - agent model . Some contemporaneous papers ﬁnd empirical support for a few of the results de - rived here . For example , Acharya and Subramanian ( 2009 ) ﬁnd that debtor - friendly bankruptcy laws lead to more innovation . Acharya , Baghai - Wadji , and Subramanian ( 2009 ) ﬁnd that stringent labor laws that restrict the dismissal of employees encourage ﬁrm - level innovation . Francis , Hasan , and Sharma ( 2009 ) show that golden parachutes as well as long - term incentives in the form of vested and unvested options have a pos - itive and signiﬁcant eﬀect on patents and citations to patents . Tian and Wang ( 2010 ) ﬁnd that ﬁrms backed by venture capitalists that tolerate failures are signiﬁcantly more innovative . Seru ( 2010 ) provides evidence that high - level managers in conglomerates are more reluctant to invest in novel projects because of the threat of reallocation of resources by headquarters . Azoulay , Graﬀ Zivin , and Manso ( 2010 ) show that funding policies with tolerance for early failure and long horizons to evaluate results motivate creativity in scientiﬁc research . In a laboratory experiment , Ederer and Manso ( 2010 ) show that compensation schemes that tolerate early failure and reward long - term suc - cess encourage innovation . Several empirical predictions remain untested though and are discussed in more detail in Section V III . 7 More generally , the paper is related to the literature that studies the eﬀect of insti - tutions on ﬁnancial organization and economic growth . Previous work in this literature has documented the eﬀect of the institutional environment ( e . g . corporate governance , investor protection , political risk ) on ﬁnancial development ( La Porta , Lopez - de Silanes , Shleifer , and Vishny 1997 ) , and economic growth ( King and Levine 1993 , Rajan and Zingales 1998 , Acemoglu , Johnson , and Robinson 2002 , Bekaert , Harvey , and Lundblad 2005 ) , Since innovation is an essential ingredient of growth ( Romer 1986 , Aghion and Howitt 1992 ) , the ﬁndings of the current paper complement this literature and provide directions for future research on the topic . II . The Tension Between Exploration and Exploita - tion In this section , I review the classical two - armed bandit problem with one known arm . This model illustrates the tension between exploration and exploitation in a single - agent decision problem . The agent lives for two periods . In each period , the agent takes an action i ∈ I , producing output S ( “success” ) with probability p i or output F ( “failure” ) with probability 1 − p i . The probability p i of success when the agent takes action i ∈ I may be unknown . To obtain information about p i , the agent needs to engage in experimentation . I let E [ p i ] denote the unconditional expectation of p i , E [ p i | S , j ] denote the conditional expectation of p i given a success on action j , and E [ p i | F , j ] denote the conditional expectation of p i given a failure on action j . When the agent takes action i ∈ I , he only learns about the probability p i , so that E [ p j ] = E [ p j | S , i ] = E [ p j | F , i ] for j 6 = i . 8 The central concern that arises when the agent learns through experimentation is the tension between exploration of new actions and exploitation of well known actions . To focus on the tension between exploration and exploitation , I assume that in each period the agent chooses between two actions . Action 1 , the conventional work method , has a known probability p 1 of success , such that p 1 = E [ p 1 ] = E [ p 1 | S , 1 ] = E [ p 1 | F , 1 ] . Action 2 , the new work method , has an unknown probability p 2 of success such that E [ p 2 | F , 2 ] < E [ p 2 ] < E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] . I assume that the new work method is of exploratory nature . This means that when the agent experiments with the new work method , he is initially not as likely to succeed as when he conforms to the conventional work method . However , if the agent observes a success with the new work method , then the agent updates his beliefs about the probability p 2 of success with the new work method , so that the new work method becomes perceived as better than the conventional work method . This is captured by : E [ p 2 ] < p 1 < E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] . ( 1 ) The agent is risk - neutral and has a discount factor normalized to one . The agent thus chooses an action plan h i jk i to maximize his total expected payoﬀ R ( h i jk i ) = { E [ p i ] S + ( 1 − E [ p i ] ) F } + E [ p i ] { E [ p j | S , i ] S + ( 1 − E [ p j | S , i ] ) F } + ( 1 − E [ p i ] ) { E [ p k | F , i ] S + ( 1 − E [ p k | F , i ] ) F } , ( 2 ) 9 where i ∈ I is the ﬁrst - period action , j ∈ I is the second - period action in case of success in the ﬁrst period , and k ∈ I is the second - period action in case of failure in the ﬁrst period . Two action plans need to be considered . Action plan h 111 i , which I call exploitation , is just the repetition of the conventional work method . Action plan h 221 i , which I call exploration , is to initially try the new work method , stick to the new work method in case of success in the ﬁrst period , and revert to the conventional work method in case of failure in the ﬁrst period . The total payoﬀ R ( h 221 i ) from exploration is higher than the total payoﬀ R ( h 111 i ) from exploitation if and only if E [ p 2 ] ≥ p 1 − p 1 ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 ) 1 + ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 ) . ( 3 ) If the agent tries the new work method , he obtains information about p 2 . This information is useful for the agent’s decision in the second period , since the agent can switch to the conventional work method in case he learns that the new work method is not worth pursuing . The agent may thus be willing to try the new work method even though the initial expected probability E [ p 2 ] of success with the new work method is lower than the probability p 1 of success with the conventional work method . The second term on the right - hand side of equation ( 3 ) represents the premium in terms of ﬁrst - period payoﬀ that the agent is willing to pay to obtain information about p 2 . The agent is willing to sacriﬁce more in the ﬁrst period if he lives for multiple periods . With multiple periods , the beneﬁts of experimenting with the new work method are higher , since the agent can use the information he learns from experimentation for a longer period of time . The same is true if the problem is to maximize the output of a team . In a team , the optimal action plan involves more sacriﬁcing of ﬁrst period output for at least one of the agents . In case the agent discovers that the new work method is better than the conventional work method , the whole team beneﬁts from his discovery . 10 III . The Principal - Agent Problem In this section , I introduce incentive problems into the classical two - armed bandit prob - lem with one known arm reviewed in the previous section . The principal hires an agent to perform the task described in the previous section . In each period , the agent incurs private costs c 1 ≥ 0 if he takes action 1 , the conventional work method , private costs c 2 ≥ 0 if he takes action 2 , the new work method , but can avoid these private costs by taking action 0 , shirking . The costs c 1 and c 2 associated with the new and conventional work methods will be important in determining the form of the optimal contract . When c 2 is high relative to c 1 , it is more costly for the agent to employ the new work method than the conventional work method , perhaps because it takes more eﬀort for the agent to search and implement new ideas . When c 1 is high relative to c 2 , it is more costly for the agent to employ the conventional work method than the new work method , perhaps because the agent dislikes monotonous work , or extracts private beneﬁts from learning new work methods . Shirking has a lower probability of success than either of the two work methods , so that p 0 < E [ p i ] for i = 1 , 2 . ( 4 ) I assume that the principal does not observe the actions taken by the agent . 3 As such , before the agent starts working , the principal oﬀers the agent a contract ~ w = { w F , w S , w SF , w SS , w FF , w FS } that speciﬁes the agent’s wages contingent on future performance . The agent has limited liability , meaning that his wages cannot be negative . 11 Both the principal and the agent are risk - neutral and have a discount factor of 1 . When the principal oﬀers the agent a contract ~ w and the agent takes action plan h i jk i , the total expected payments from the principal to the agent are given by W ( ~ w , h i jk i ) = { E [ p i ] w S + ( 1 − E [ p i ] ) w F } + E [ p i ] { E [ p j | S , i ] w SS + ( 1 − E [ p j | S , i ] ) w SF } + ( 1 − E [ p i ] ) { E [ p k | F , i ] w FS + ( 1 − E [ p k | F , i ] ) w FF } . When the agent takes action plan h i jk i , the total expected costs incurred by the agent are given by C ( h i jk i ) = c i + E [ p i ] c j + ( 1 − E [ p i ] ) c k . I say that ~ w is an optimal contract that implements action plan h i jk i if it minimizes the total expected payments from the principal to the agent , W ( ~ w , h i jk i ) subject to to the incentive compatibility constraints , 4 W ( ~ w , h i jk i ) − C ( h i jk i ) ≥ W ( ~ w , h lmn i ) − C ( h lmn i ) . ( IC h lmn i ) This is a linear program with 6 unknowns and 27 constraints . When there is more than one contract that solves this program , I restrict attention to the contract that pays the agent earlier . 5 The principal’s expected proﬁt Π ( h i jk i ) from implementing action plan h i jk i is given by Π ( h i jk i ) = R ( h i jk i ) − W ( ~ w ( h i jk i ) , h i jk i ) . ( 5 ) 12 where R ( h i jk i ) is the principal’s total expected revenue when the agent uses action plan h i jk i , and ~ w ( h i jk i ) is the optimal contract that implements action plan h i jk i . The principal thus chooses the action plan h i jk i that maximizes Π ( h i jk i ) . Both the classical two - armed bandit problem and the standard work - shirk principal - agent model are special cases of this model . On one hand , when c 1 = c 2 = 0 , there is no conﬂict of interest between the principal and the agent . Therefore , the principal does not need to provide incentives to the agent , and the principal just solves the two - armed bandit problem described in Section II . On the other hand , when c 2 = ∞ , it is too costly for the agent to employ the new work method . The agent either shirks or employs the conventional work method . The principal’s problem is thus just to prevent the agent from shirking , as in standard principal - agent models . The assumptions in the principal - agent problem studied here are standard except that there is learning about the technology being employed . This gives rise to the tension between exploration and exploitation , since there is nothing to be learned about the conventional technology , but a lot to be learned about the new technology . IV . Incentives for Exploration and Exploitation In this section , I study the optimal contracts that implement exploration and exploita - tion respectively . In the online appendix , I study the choice of the principal between exploration and exploitation and the distortions relative to the ﬁrst best produced by agency costs . For clarity of exposition , I will restrict attention to c 2 / c 1 ≥ ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) / ( p 1 − p 0 ) . ( 6 ) 13 The right - hand side of equation ( 6 ) is lower than 1 . Restricting attention to ( 6 ) thus rules out situations in which the cost of employing the new work method is much lower than the cost of employing the conventional work method . Similar results hold without this restriction . However , the analysis is more complicated and does not add new insights . A . Incentives for Exploitation Proposition 1 derives the optimal contract that implements exploitation . Recalling from Section II exploitation is given by the action plan h 111 i . The following deﬁnitions are useful in stating Proposition 1 : α 1 = c 1 p 1 − p 0 β 1 = ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) + E [ p 2 ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ) ( p 1 − p 0 ) + E [ p 2 ] ( p 1 − p 0 ) Proposition 1 The optimal contract ~ w 1 that implements exploitation is such that w F = w SF = w FF = 0 , w SS = w FS = α 1 , w S = α 1 + c 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( p 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) (cid:18) β 1 − c 2 c 1 (cid:19) + , where ( x ) + = max ( x , 0 ) . The formal proofs of all the propositions are in the Appendix . Here is the main intuition behind Proposition 1 . To implement exploitation , the principal must prevent the agent from shirking and from exploring . If c 2 is high relative to c 1 , only shirking constraints are binding , and thus the optimal contract that implements exploitation is similar to the optimal contract used to induce the agent to exert eﬀort in a standard word - shirk principal - agent model . If c 2 is low relative to c 1 , the exploration constraint is binding . To prevent exploration , the principal must pay the agent an extra premium 14 w S 0 5 10 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 c 2 / c 1 w SS 0 5 10 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 c 2 / c 1 w SF = 0 w F = 0 w FS 0 5 10 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 c 2 / c 1 w FF = 0 Figure 1 . The optimal contract that implements exploitation under the base case parameters . The contract resembles a repetition of standard pay - for - performance con - tracts . Total pay of the agent depends only on total output , except if c 2 / c 1 is small , in which case the agent gets an extra reward for early success to prevent exploration . in case of success in the ﬁrst period . This extra premium is decreasing in c 2 / c 1 , since as c 2 / c 1 increases the agent becomes less inclined to explore . Figure 1 shows the optimal contract ~ w 1 that implements exploitation for diﬀerent values of c 2 / c 1 under the base case parameters . 6 B . Incentives for Exploration Proposition 2 derives the optimal contract that implements exploration . Recalling from Section II , exploration is given by action plan h 221 i . The form of the optimal contract that implements exploration will depend on whether exploration is moderate or radical . Deﬁnition 1 Exploration is radical if 1 − E [ p 2 ] 1 − p 1 ≥ E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] p 21 , 15 and moderate otherwise . Exploration is radical if the likelihood ratio between exploration and exploitation of a failure in the ﬁrst period is greater than the likelihood ratio between exploration and exploitation of two consecutive successes . I call this exploration radical because it has a high expected probability of failure in the ﬁrst period relative to the probability of failure of the conventional action . The following deﬁnitions will also be useful in stating Proposition 2 : α 2 = max ˜  ∈ { 0 , 1 } ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) c 2 − p 0 c ˜  E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 E [ p ˜  ] + ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) p 0 α 1 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 E [ p ˜  ] . β 2 = ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 ) + E [ p 2 ] ( p 1 E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 ) ( p 21 − p 0 p 1 ) + E [ p 2 ] ( p 21 − p 0 p 1 ) Proposition 2 The optimal contract ~ w 2 that implements exploration is such that w FS = α 1 , and w S = w SF = w FF = 0 . If exploration is moderate , then w F = 0 , and w SS = α 2 + p 1 − p 0 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 p 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) c 1 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 2 1 (cid:18) c 2 c 1 − β 2 (cid:19) + . If exploration is radical , then w F = p 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) c 1 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 E [ p 2 ] (cid:18) c 2 c 1 − β 2 (cid:19) + , and w SS = α 2 + E [ p 2 ] − p 0 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 p 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) c 1 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 E [ p 2 ] (cid:18) c 2 c 1 − β 2 (cid:19) + . 16 To implement exploration , the principal must prevent the agent from shirking or exploiting . The principal does not make payments to the agent after a failure in the second period , since this only gives incentives for the agent to shirk . Moreover , the principal does not make payments to the agent after a success in the ﬁrst period for two reasons . First , rewarding ﬁrst - period success gives the agent incentives to employ the conventional work method in the ﬁrst period , since the initial expected probability E [ p 2 ] of success with the new work method is lower than the probability p 1 of success with the conventional work method . Second , in case of a success in the ﬁrst period , additional information about the ﬁrst - period action is provided by the second - period performance , since the expected probability of success with the new work method in the second period depends on the action taken by the agent in the ﬁrst period . Delaying compensation to obtain this additional information is thus optimal . Although there are 27 incentive compatibility constraints , it is easy to see that only a few may bind . The relevant incentive compatibility constraints are ( p 1 − p 0 ) w FS ≥ c 1 ( IC h 220 i ) ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 20 ) w SS − ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) w F − ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) p 1 w FS ≥ c 2 + E [ p 2 ] ( c 2 − c 1 ) + p 0 c 1 ( IC h 001 i ) ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 ) w SS − ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) w F − ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) p 1 w FS ≥ c 2 + E [ p 2 ] ( c 2 − c 1 ) ( IC h 011 i ) ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 21 ) w SS + ( p 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) w F + ( p 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 1 w FS ≥ ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( c 2 − c 1 ) ( IC h 111 i ) 17 The ﬁrst three incentive compatibility constraints are associated with shirking . The last incentive compatibility constraint is associated with exploitation . One important thing to note is that w F enters with a positive sign on the left hand side of the incentive compatibility constraint associated with exploitation . Rewarding the agent for ﬁrst - period failures may be useful to prevent the agent from exploiting , since the initial expected probability ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) of failure when the agent employs the new work method is higher than the probability ( 1 − p 1 ) of failure when the agent employs the conventional work method . The ﬁrst incentive compatibility constraint is always binding . To prevent the agent from shirking in the second period after a failure in the ﬁrst period , the principal pays w FS = α 1 to the agent just as in standard principal - agent models . It remains to discuss how the principal uses w SS and w F to induce the agent to experiment with the new work method . If c 2 / c 1 < β 2 , then exploitation is too costly for the agent . Only incentive com - patibility constraints associated with shirking are binding . To prevent the agent from shirking in the ﬁrst period and in the second period after a success in the ﬁrst period , the principal pays w SS = α 2 to the agent . If c 2 / c 1 ≥ β 2 , then exploitation is not too costly for the agent . The incentive compat - ibility constraint associated with exploitation is binding . To prevent exploitation , the principal can either reward the agent for failure in the ﬁrst period or reward the agent for two consecutive successes . The principal’s choice between these two instruments depends on whether exploration is moderate or radical . With moderate exploration , it is cheaper for the principal to provide incentives through w SS , since two consecutive success are a stronger signal that the agent explored and not exploited than a failure in the ﬁrst period . With radical exploration , it is cheaper for the principal to provide incentives through w F , since a failure in the ﬁrst period is a stronger signal that the agent explored and not exploited than two consecutive successes .

The optimal contract that implements exploration under the base parame - ters . Under this contract , an agent who succeeds early and fails later has lower total compensation than an agent who fails early and succeeds later or even an agent who fails twice if c 2 / c 1 is high . for failure , however , induces the agent to shirk in the ﬁrst period . To prevent shirking , delayed compensation w SS must also be used . Figure 2 shows the optimal contract that implements exploration for diﬀerent values of c 2 / c 1 under the base case parameters . The optimal contract that implements explo - ration rewards long - term success , but not short - term success . On the contrary , it may even reward short - term failure . This safety - net is provided even though the agent is risk - neutral . The intuition is that if the agent is not protected against failures , then the agent may prefer to exploit in order to avoid failures . An alternative way to interpret the optimal contract that implements exploration is to look at how it compensates diﬀerent performance paths . The total compensation w F + w FS when performance is F S is higher than the total compensation w S + w SF when performance is SF . An agent who recovers from failure has a higher compensation than an agent who obtains short - lived success . Rewards are thus contingent on the 19 performance path , and not only on the number of successes or failures obtained by the agent . If w F > 0 , then the total compensation w F + w FF when performance is F F is higher than the total compensation w S + w SF when performance is SF . Even an agent who fails twice may have a higher compensation than an agent who obtains short - lived success . Because of the risky nature of exploration , failing twice may be a stronger signal for the principal that the agent explored and not exploited than obtaining a short - lived success . Some principal - agent models assume that the agent can destroy output . In a static setting , this assumption implies that the optimal contract is non - decreasing . In a dy - namic setting , however , this is not necessarily true . For example , in the model developed here , setting p 0 = 0 will have the same eﬀect as allowing the agent to destroy output . Still , from Proposition 5 , the optimal contract that implements exploration may have w S < w F . Under this contract , if the agent decides to destroy output at the end of the ﬁrst period to obtain w F , the agent foregoes the opportunity of earning w SS in the second period . V . Lack of Commitment In contrast to the previous section , I now assume that the principal cannot commit to a long - term contract . In practice , commitment to a long - term contract may be achieved through explicit contracts , such as stock options or vesting stock , or through implicit contracts , based on reputation . Sometimes these options are not available , and the prin - cipal can only oﬀer the agent a short - term contract specifying the agent’s compensation contingent on the current period performance . The problem becomes similar to the one proposed in Section III , except that there are additional constraints to guarantee that the principal is willing to keep the promised wages in the second period . 20 Fudenberg , Holmstrom , and Milgrom ( 1990 ) provide conditions under which a se - quence of short - term contracts perform just as well as the optimal long - term contract . The model proposed here violates two of these conditions . First , there may not be common knowledge of technology . With learning through experimentation , the agent may be better informed than the principal about the technology in the second period , since ﬁrst - period actions aﬀect second - period expected probability of success . Second , the utility frontier may not be downward sloping , since the agent has limited liability . Proposition 3 The optimal contract ~ w 1 that implements exploitation , derived in Propo - sition 1 , can be realized through a sequence of short - term contracts . To implement exploitation , a sequence of short - term contracts performs just as well as the optimal long - term contract , because the optimal long - term contract that implements exploitation derived in Proposition 1 relies only on short - term incentives . Commitment is thus irrelevant to implement exploitation . The following deﬁnition will be useful in stating Proposition 4 : β 4 = ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) ( 1 + p 1 ) ( p 1 − p 0 ) (cid:16) 1 + p 1 E [ p 2 ] − p 0 E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 (cid:17) . Proposition 4 The optimal contract ~ w 2 that implements exploration , derived in Propo - sition 2 , cannot be replicated by a sequence of short - term contracts . Moreover , if • c 2 / c 1 ≥ β 4 , then exploration is not implementable via short - term contracts . • c 2 / c 1 < β 4 , then the optimal sequence of short - term contracts ~ w 4 that implements exploration is such that w S = c 2 E [ p 2 ] − p 0 − p 0 w SS + p 0 w FS , w F = w SF = w FF = 0 , 21 w SS = c 2 E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 , w FS = c 1 p 1 − p 0 . Without commitment , the principal can only use short - term incentives to imple - ment exploration . When c 2 / c 1 ≥ β 4 , short - term incentives are not enough to induce exploration . If the principal rewards the agent for success in the ﬁrst period , then the agent employs the conventional work method , which is relatively cheaper and yields a higher probability of success than the new work method . If , on the contrary , the prin - cipal rewards the agent for failure in the ﬁrst period , then the agent shirks , which is cheaper and yields a higher probability of failure than the new work method . There - fore , if c 2 / c 1 ≥ β 4 , exploration cannot be implemented with a sequence of short - term contracts . 7 When c 2 / c 1 < β 4 , short - term incentives may be enough to implement explo - ration . If the principal rewards the agent for success in the ﬁrst period , it is too costly for the agent to employ the conventional work method . Exploration may thus be im - plementable with a sequence of short - term contracts . However , the cost W ( ~ w 4 , h 221 i ) of implementing exploration with short - term contracts is higher than the cost W ( ~ w 2 , h 221 i ) of implementing exploration with a long - term contract . When a long - term contract is used , the principal can wait until the second period to pay the agent , gathering more information about the agent’s ﬁrst period action . Figure 3 compares the cost of implementing exploration when the principal can and cannot commit to a long - term contract . Exploration is implementable via a sequence of short - term contracts only if c 2 / c 1 is low . Even if this is the case , the cost W ( ~ w 4 , h 221 i ) of implementing exploration with short - term contracts is higher than the cost W ( ~ w 2 , h 221 i ) of implementing exploration with a long - term contract . This section contrasts the eﬀect of lack of commitment on the implementation of exploration and exploitation . To implement exploitation , a sequence of short - term con - tracts performs as well as the optimal long - term contract . On the other hand , to imple - ment exploration , the optimal long - term contract performs better than any sequence of 22 0 5 10 15 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 ImplementationCost c 2 / c 1 Figure 3 . Cost of implementing exploration when the principal can ( solid line ) and cannot ( dashed line ) commit to a long - term contract under the base parameters . Even if it is feasible to motivate exploration with a sequence of short - term contracts ( low c 2 / c 1 ) , it is less costly to implement exploration if the principal can commit to a long - term contract . short - term contracts . For some parameters , it is even impossible to implement explo - ration with a sequence of short - term contracts . These results show the importance of commitment when implementing exploration . VI . Termination In this section , I allow the principal to terminate the agent after a failure in the ﬁrst period . Termination can be interpreted , for example , as the decision to ﬁre a manager or worker in a corporation , or the decision to interrupt funding of a startup company . The principal may use termination as a screening device , ﬁring the agent if it is not worthwhile to keep him in the second period . In addition to that , the principal may use termination as a disciplinary device to induce the agent to take the appropriate action in the ﬁrst period . I derive the optimal contracts that implement exploitation with termination and exploration with termination . I then study when it is optimal for the principal to implement exploitation with termination instead of exploitation , and exploration with termination instead of exploration . Exploitation with termination is represented by 23 action plan h 11 t i , and exploration with termination is represented by action plan h 22 t i , where t means that the principal terminates the agent after a failure in the ﬁrst period . For simplicity , the agent’s outside wages after termination are zero . 8 The principal’s expected revenues when implementing exploration with termination and exploitation with termination are given by R ( h 11 t i ) and R ( h 22 t i ) , which may incorporate , for example , the possibility of hiring a replacement agent after termination . For brevity , the results on the implementation of exploitation with termination are derived in the online appendix . Figure 4 compares the optimal contracts that implement exploitation and exploitation with termination for diﬀerent values of c 2 / c 1 under the base case parameters . If the agent shirks or employs the new work method , he is more likely to fail in the ﬁrst period than if he employs the conventional work method . To avoid failure , and consequently termination , the agent has more incentives to employ the conventional work method in the ﬁrst period . Therefore , the principal needs to pay the agent lower ﬁrst - period wages to implement exploitation with termination than to implement exploitation . This result is similar to Stiglitz and Weiss ( 1983 ) , where the principal uses termi - nation to induce the agent to exert eﬀort . Because termination serves this additional role in providing incentives to the agent , it is optimal for the principal to use excessive termination when implementing exploitation . Proposition 5 derives the optimal contract that implements exploration with termi - nation . The following deﬁnitions will be useful in stating Proposition 5 : α 5 = max ˜  ∈ { 0 , 1 } ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) c 2 − p 0 c ˜  E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 E [ p ˜  ] , β 5 = ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 ) + E [ p 2 ] ( p 1 E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) ( p 21 − p 0 ) + E [ p 2 ] ( p 21 − p 0 ) . 24 w S 0 5 10 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 c 2 / c 1 w SS 0 5 10 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 c 2 / c 1 w SF = 0 w F = 0 Figure 4 . The optimal contracts that implement exploitation ( solid line ) and exploita - tion with termination ( dashed line ) under the base parameters . With termination , the agent loses the rents he was able to extract in the second period after a failure in the ﬁrst period . The threat of termination thus induces the agent to exert more eﬀort in the ﬁrst period , and therefore the principal needs to pay less to the agent for early success in order to implement exploitation . Proposition 5 The optimal contract ~ w 5 that implements exploration with termination is such that w S = w SF = 0 . If exploration is moderate , then w F = 0 , and w SS = α 5 + p 1 − p 0 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 p 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) c 1 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 2 1 (cid:18) c 2 c 1 − β 5 (cid:19) + . If exploration is radical , then w F = p 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) c 1 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 E [ p 2 ] (cid:18) c 2 c 1 − β 5 (cid:19) + and w SS = α 5 + E [ p 2 ] − p 0 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 p 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) c 1 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 E [ p 2 ] (cid:18) c 2 c 1 − β 5 (cid:19) + . 25 The eﬀects of termination on the incentives for the agent to employ the new work method in the ﬁrst period will depend on the relative costs c 2 / c 1 of the new and con - ventional work methods . If c 2 / c 1 ≥ β 5 , then the incentive compatibility constraint associated with exploitation with termination is binding . Termination makes it harder to provide incentives for the agent to employ the new work method in the ﬁrst period , since to avoid failure and termination the agent has more incentives to employ the con - ventional work method in the ﬁrst period . If c 2 / c 1 < β 5 , then the incentive compatibility constraint associated with shirking is binding . Termination makes it easier to provide incentives for the agent to employ the new work method in the ﬁrst period , since to avoid failure and termination the agent has less incentives to shirk in the ﬁrst period . Figure 5 compares the optimal contracts that implement exploration and exploration with termination for diﬀerent values of c 2 / c 1 under the base case parameters . If c 2 / c 1 is high , the principal pays higher wages w F to implement exploration with termination than to implement exploration . If c 2 / c 1 is low , the principal pays lower wages w SS to implement exploration with termination than to implement exploration . I now compare the total expected proﬁts of the principal when he implements explo - ration with the total expected proﬁts of the principal when he implements exploration with termination . It is optimal for the principal to implement exploration with termi - nation instead of exploration if R ( h 221 i ) − R ( h 22 t i ) < W ( ~ w 2 , h 221 i ) − W ( ~ w 5 , h 22 t i ) To keep the agent working in the second period after a failure in the ﬁrst period , the expected payments from the principal to the agent are equal to ( 1 − p 1 ) p 1 α 1 . It is thus ex post eﬃcient for the principal to terminate the agent after a failure in the ﬁrst period if R ( h 221 i ) − R ( h 22 t i ) < ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 1 α 1 . ( 7 ) 26 w S = 0 w SS 0 15 30 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 c 2 / c 1 w SF = 0 w F 0 15 30 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 c 2 / c 1 Figure 5 . The optimal contract that implements exploration ( solid line ) and exploration with termination ( dashed line ) under the base parameters . With termination , the agent loses the rents he was able to extract in the second period after a failure in the ﬁrst period . To prevent the threat of termination from drawing the agent away from exploration in the ﬁrst period , the principal needs to pay an additional bonus to the agent after early failure if c 2 / c 1 is high . 27 When ( 7 ) holds , the beneﬁts from inducing the agent to work in the second period after a failure in the ﬁrst period are lower than the expected payments that the principal must make to the agent after a failure in the ﬁrst period to keep the agent working in the second period . Deﬁnition 2 There is excessive termination with exploration if W ( ~ w 2 , h 221 i ) − W ( ~ w 5 , h 22 t i ) > ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 1 α 1 , and there is excessive continuation with exploration if W ( ~ w 2 , h 221 i ) − W ( ~ w 5 , h 22 t i ) < ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 1 α 1 . There is excessive termination with exploration if the actual threshold for termina - tion is higher than the ex post eﬃcient threshold for termination . There is excessive continuation with exploration if the actual threshold for termination is lower than the ex post eﬃcient threshold for termination . Excessive continuation or termination may arise because the termination policy aﬀects the incentives for the agent’s ﬁrst - period action . Corollary 1 investigates the conditions under which there is excessive termination with exploration or excessive continuation with exploration . The following deﬁnitions will be useful in stating Corollary 1 : κ m ≡ ( p 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 p 0 ) ( p 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 p 0 ) + ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 21 ) , κ e ≡ ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 ) ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 ) + E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) . 28 Corollary 1 If c 2 / c 1 < max ( κ m , κ e ) β 2 + ( 1 − max ( κ m , κ e ) ) β 5 , then there is excessive termination with exploration . If c 2 / c 1 > max ( κ m , κ e ) β 2 + ( 1 − max ( κ m , κ e ) ) β 5 , then there is excessive continuation with exploration . As shown in Proposition 5 , the eﬀects of termination on the incentives for the agent to employ the new work method in the ﬁrst period depend on c 2 / c 1 . For low values of c 2 / c 1 , the agent is inclined to shirk . The threat of termination allows the principal to pay the agent lower wages to prevent shirking , oﬀsetting the losses from excessive termination . For high values of c 2 / c 1 , the agent is inclined to exploit . Excessive continuation allows the principal to pay the agent lower wages in the ﬁrst period , oﬀsetting the losses from excessive continuation . As shown in Corollary 1 , there is excessive continuation with exploration even if exploration is moderate . This is in contrast to the results in Proposition 2 which say that there is reward for failure only if exploration is radical . With moderate exploration , the principal does not reward the agent for failure because it is cheaper to use rewards for long - term success to induce exploration . However , the surplus the agent obtains in the second period after a failure in the ﬁrst period still provides incentives for the agent to explore when c 2 is high relative to c 1 . This section contrasts the optimal termination policies when implementing exploita - tion and exploration . Similarly to models of repeated eﬀort , there is excessive ter - mination when implementing exploitation . On the other hand , depending on which constraints are binding , there may be excessive termination or excessive continuation when implementing exploration . There is excessive termination if only shirking con - straints are binding , while there is excessive continuation if the exploitation constraint is binding . To sum up , termination is useful to prevent shirking but it may be harmful when implementing exploration as it may induce exploitation from the agent . 29 VII . Feedback In this section , I study what happens if the principal is better able than the agent to evaluate performance . This could be relevant , for example , in studying the relation be - tween a venture capitalist and an entrepreneur , in which the venture capitalist knows more about the commercial value of the enterprise than the entrepreneur . Also , ﬁrms often have better information about the potential market performance of products be - ing developed by their R & D employees . The focus of the section will be on whether the principal should provide feedback on performance to the agent . I show that the optimal provision of feedback will depend on whether the principal wants to implement exploration or exploitation . I assume that the principal privately observes interim performance at the end of the ﬁrst period , yet the performance path is publicly observable at the end of the second period . If the principal does not reveal interim performance realizations , then only incentive compatibility constraints IC h i jk i where j = k need to be satisﬁed , since without feedback the agent cannot adjust his action according to the realization of ﬁrst - period performance . However , for the same reason , only action plans h i jk i with j = k can be implemented without feedback . Therefore , if the action plan to be implemented involves repetitive actions , then it is optimal for the principal not to provide feedback on performance . On the other hand , if the action plan to be implemented requires adjustments in action depending on the realized interim performance , then feedback on performance must be provided . For brevity , the detailed analysis of the provision of feedback when the principal im - plements exploitation is presented in the online appendix . Because exploitation involves repetitive actions , it is optimal for the principal not to provide feedback on performance to the agent . This result is similar to Lizzeri , Meyer , and Persico ( 2002 ) and Fuchs ( 2007 ) who ﬁnd that , in a setting where the principal’s problem is to induce the agent 30 to exert repeated eﬀort , it is optimal for the principal not to reveal information about performance to the agent . In contrast , as shown by the next proposition , feedback is essential to motivate exploration , as it permits eﬃcient experimentation . Proposition 6 To implement exploration , the principal must provide feedback to the agent . The optimal contract ~ w 6 that implements exploration when the principal is better able than the agent to evaluate performance is the same as the optimal contract ~ w 2 that implements exploration derived in Proposition 2 . The function of feedback here is to provide information that improves the agent’s future performance . No punishment is associated with feedback . On the contrary , for some parameters the agent is even rewarded in case of failure . If the agent is not protected against failures , then the agent is inclined to employ the conventional work method to avoid failures . 9 This section contrasts the feedback policy when implementing exploitation and ex - ploration . It shows that , similarly to repeated - eﬀort models , the principal should never provide feedback on performance to the agent when implementing exploitation , but should always provide timely feedback on performance to the agent when implementing exploration . VIII . Empirical Implications The main contribution of the paper is to contrast incentive schemes that motivate explo - ration and exploitation . Motivating exploitation requires standard pay - for - performance schemes , excessive termination , short - term contracts , and no feedback on performance . In contrast , motivating exploration involves tolerance ( or even reward ) for early failure and reward for long - term success , so that not only total performance but also the path of 31 performance matters for compensation . Moreover , excessive continuation , commitment to a long - term incentive plan , and timely feedback on performance are also important ingredients to motivate exploration . Two empirical tests arise naturally . First , one can study whether incentive practices used in tasks for which innovation is more ( less ) important resemble the incentive prac - tices that , according to this paper , motivate exploration ( exploitation ) . Second , one can study whether the adoption of incentive practices that motivate exploration ( exploita - tion ) indeed leads to more ( less ) innovation . In the remainder of this section , I discuss the application of the results of the paper to diﬀerent settings , providing more details about how they can be tested empirically . Executive Compensation and Corporate Governance Executive compensation has increasingly been criticized as excessive and not related to performance . This pub - lic outcry creates pressure for regulations that limit the use of stock options , golden parachutes , entrenchment , and option repricing . 10 We will argue here that stock options , golden parachutes , entrenchment , and options repricing may be part of an optimal con - tract that motivates innovation . Therefore , passing regulations that restrict their use may in some cases have an adverse eﬀect on innovation . In order to assess the actual im - pact of such regulations , it remains to be studied empirically the actual contribution of these practices to innovation as well as the value of additional investments in innovation . From Propositions 2 and 5 it is easy to see that the optimal compensation that moti - vates exploration with and without termination can be implemented via a combination of stock options with long vesting periods , option repricing , and golden parachutes . For simplicity , I assume that the ﬁrm does not pay dividends until the second period . By granting the manager stock options that vest and mature at the end of the second period and have a strike price of S , it is possible to commit to a payment of w SS to the man - ager after two consecutive successes . If the manager fails in the ﬁrst period , there are two situations to consider . When parameters of the model are such that the manager 32 needs to be ﬁred , he may leave the ﬁrm with a payment w F as shown in Proposition 5 . This payment can be implemented by promising the manager a severance payment ( for example , in the form of a golden parachute ) to be paid in case the manager gets ﬁred . When the manager is to stay in the ﬁrm , then the optimal contract can be implemented by repricing the original stock option . The option repricing needs to be done in a way that guarantees that the manager puts eﬀort in the second period ( w FS > c 1 / ( p 1 − p 0 ) ) , and also that the manager gets an extra surplus ( w F ) for early failures as shown in Proposition 2 . 11 Corollary 1 shows that , under the optimal contract that motivates exploration , share - holders may need to commit not to ﬁre the manager even if it is ex - post eﬃcient to do so . Managerial entrenchment can produce this desired excessive continuation , as it makes it harder for shareholders to ﬁre the manager . The appointment of a board of directors that is friendly to the manager may lead to managerial entrenchment . Alterna - tively , dispersed ownership , typical in large public corporations , reduces the incentives for shareholders to intervene , eﬀectively entrenching the manager . 12 This naturally raises the question of why a lot of the innovation in the economy comes from ﬁrms ﬁnanced by venture capital , which has concentrated ownership . Some of the practices adopted by venture capitalists may help motivating innovation . 13 For example , excessive continuation may be achieved by delegating the decision to stop a project to the general partner . The bulk of the compensation of the general partner is in the form of carried interest , which is eﬀectively a call option on the projects being ﬁnanced . This provides incentives for the general partner to keep alive projects beyond the point under which it would be eﬃcient to terminate them . Moreover , the entrepreneur in a start - up company ﬁnanced by a venture capitalist typically does not earn rewards for early successes , and most of his compensation comes in the long - term , when the company goes through an IPO or is sold to another ﬁrm . Venture capitalists are also known for providing detailed feedback on performance to entrepreneurs . 33 The theory developed here suggests that stock options with long vesting periods , entrenchment , and golden parachutes should be more often used in situations in which exploration and innovation are important . One potentially interesting direction of re - search is to study if these instruments are indeed more common in ﬁrms and industries involved in innovation . Francis , Hasan , and Sharma ( 2009 ) show that golden parachutes as well as long - term incentives in the form of vested and unvested options have a positive and signiﬁcant eﬀect on patents and citations to patents . Atanassov ( 2008 ) and Sapra , Subramanian , and Subramanian ( 2009 ) study the eﬀects of corporate governance on in - novation . Tian and Wang ( 2010 ) ﬁnd that startup ﬁrms ﬁnanced by venture capitalists that are more tolerant to early failures are more innovative . Previous studies , such as Lambert ( 1986 ) , and Feltham and Wu ( 2001 ) have devel - oped static models in which the optimal compensation that encourages risk - taking is convex , resembling a stock option . Other studies derived optimal contracts that , for diﬀerent reasons than the one proposed here , involve golden parachutes , entrenchment , or option repricing . In a setting in which the manager observes a private signal about the future prospects of the ﬁrm , Inderst and Mueller ( 2010 ) and Rayo and Sapra ( 2009 ) show that stock options and golden parachutes may be optimal to induce the manager to reveal information to the board after bad outcomes . In an incomplete contracting framework , Almazan and Suarez ( 2003 ) show that a contract consisting of bonus and severance pay may be optimal to induce the incumbent manager to invest in ﬁrm - speciﬁc human capital when there is the threat that a better rival manager becomes available . In a setting where the only instruments available to the principal are at - the - money call op - tions , Acharya , John , and Sundaram ( 2000 ) show that option repricing may be optimal because it motivates the agent to exert eﬀort after poor performance . Bankruptcy Laws and Entrepreneurship Bankruptcy laws in Europe and in the United States have recently been under debate . On one hand , to encourage entrepreneurial 34 activity , the European Council issued in June of 2000 the “European Charter for Small Enterprises , ”which states that . . . failure is concomitant with responsible initiative and risk - taking and must be mainly envisage as a learning opportunity . The Charter declares that bankruptcy law reforms should become a clear priority for the Member States and that new bankruptcy laws should allow failed entrepreneurs a fresh start . On the other hand , after eight years of discussion , the U . S . Congress passed in April of 2005 a new creditor - friendly bankruptcy law , the “Bankruptcy Abuse and Consumer Protection Act , ” which makes it more diﬃcult for insolvent debtors to obtain exemptions and discharge of obligations . The model developed in this paper sheds light on the incentive eﬀects of diﬀerent bankruptcy laws . If the entrepreneur borrows money to undertake some project and the project fails , then the entrepreneur will not have the funds to pay his debts and will be insolvent . From Propositions 1 and 2 , the optimal contracts that motivate exploration and exploitation are quite diﬀerent in the way they treat insolvent debtors . The optimal contract that motivates exploration rewards the agent after failure . One can interpret this as a bankruptcy law based on the principle of a fresh start , as it provides the entrepreneur with generous exemptions and an immediate full discharge of debt , so that the entrepreneur keeps some surplus after failure ( in a violation of the absolute priority of claims ) . By protecting the entrepreneur against early failure , these bankruptcy laws make the entrepreneur more inclined to explore . On the other hand , the optimal contract that implements exploitation does not reward the agent after failure . One can interpret this as a bankruptcy law based on the principle of absolute priority . The creditor seizes the goods owned by the entrepreneur and discharge takes several years . A natural question to ask is why governments impose a single mandatory bankruptcy law , instead of oﬀering a menu of bankruptcy laws that contains the optimal law for dif - ferent situations . By considering the incentives for exploration , this paper provides 35 a potential explanation for this question . Due to knowledge spillovers and imperfect intellectual - property - rights ( IPR ) protection , individuals involved in exploratory activi - ties cannot fully appropriate the economic value generated by the knowledge they pro - duce . As argued by Nelson ( 1959 ) , this leads to under - exploration when compared to the socially eﬃcient level of exploration . One way to alleviate the under - exploration problem , is by imposing a debtor - friendly bankruptcy law . There is a large literature on the design of bankruptcy laws . Based on standard models of incentives , Jensen ( 1991 ) and Aghion , Hart , and Moore ( 1992 ) are strong proponents of bankruptcy laws that respect the absolute priority of claims . Other papers have found beneﬁcial eﬀects of deviations from absolute priority . For example , Bebchuk and Picker ( 1993 ) , and Berkovitch , Israel , and Zender show that deviations of absolute priority may encourage investments in ﬁrm - speciﬁc versus general human capital . Baird ( 1991 ) and Povel ( 1999 ) show that deviations of absolute priority induce the entrepreneur to reveal private information to creditors when bad outcomes occur . 14 Ayotte ( 2007 ) shows that a mandatory debtor - friendly bankruptcy law may increase social welfare , because it prevents the monopolist bank from extracting too much surplus from the entrepreneur . Acharya and Subramanian ( 2009 ) analyze the eﬀect of bankruptcy laws on entrepreneurship using cross - sectional and time series data of several countries . They ﬁnd that debtor - friendly bankruptcy laws lead to more innovation . Intrapreneurship in Large Corporations Managers of large corporations often claim that it is hard to motivate their employees to be more creative . 15 One potential explanation is the diﬃculty large corporations face in credibly promising to reward employees for their discoveries and to tolerate early failures . In the case of executive compensation , companies can overcome this problem by using stock options with long vesting periods , option repricing , golden parachutes , and entrenchment . For lower level employees , however , these types of contracts may not be available , since , for example , there may be no veriﬁable measures of the long - term performance of the employee . 36 To overcome these diﬃculties , business consultants have argued that nurturing a corporate culture that allows freedom to experiment and tolerates failures is essential to motivate innovation among employees of large corporation . Farson and Keyes ( 2002 ) and Sutton ( 2002 ) contain several examples of innovative corporations , such as IBM and 3M , that adopt such culture . As shown in Proposition 4 , the ability to commit to a long - term contract is essential to encourage exploration . Promises made in the form of a corporate culture can be enforced through reputation . From Proposition 2 , a corporate culture that tolerates early failure and rewards long - term success is optimal to motivate exploration . Innovative organizations may also rely on explicit long - term contracts to overcome the commitment problem and induce exploration . For example , research departments in business or academic organizations often grant tenure to their researchers . Know - ing that they will not lose their jobs , researchers are wiling to explore new research directions that are likely to fail , but may lead to breakthroughs . Even before obtaining tenure , researchers in academic organizations are usually given a period of time under which they cannot be terminated . From Corollary 1 , by committing not to terminate researchers , research departments are able to motivate exploration . Researchers are also often given explicit rewards for long - term success . Lerner and Wulf ( 2007 ) have found that more long - term incentives to the heads of research and development departments are associated with more heavily cited patents , while short - term incentives are unrelated to measures of innovation . The way a corporation organizes its internal capital markets may also have an impact on innovation . Seru ( 2010 ) ﬁnds evidence that high - level managers in conglomerates are more reluctant to invest in novel projects because of the threat of relocation of resources by headquarters in case of failure . Sometimes a corporation is able to overcome this problem by creating a central fund that provides resources for experiments in diﬀerent units , so that an experiment failure does not aﬀect the budget situation of the division . Thomke ( 2002 ) discusses the case of Bank of America , which created a central fund to 37 fund experiments and assigned 25 of its branches to being used as real - life laboratories where new products and service concepts were tested . Consistent with the predictions of the model developed here , the incentive scheme of the exploration team responsible for these branches is very diﬀerent from the incentive schemes of the rest of workers in Bank of America . Initially , the exploration team was assigned a target failure rate of 30 % . In the ﬁrst year of operation the team had only 10 % failure . As the leader of the exploration team explained , “We are trying to sell ourselves to the bank . If we have too many failures , we just won’t be accepted . ” To make it clearer that failures are welcome , the top executives of Bank of America were contemplating an increase in the target failure rate from 30 % to 40 % . IX . Additional Discussion I assumed throughout the paper that the agent is risk - neutral and has limited liability . Results similar to the ones obtained here hold if the agent is risk - averse . The critical elements inﬂuencing the optimal contracts are the likelihood ratios between the diﬀerent action plans , and not the agent’s preferences . If the agent is risk - neutral , then the problem of ﬁnding the optimal contract that implements a given action plan simpliﬁes to a linear programming problem . This allows me to focus on incentive issues rather than on risk - sharing issues . For tractability , I restricted the analysis to a model with two periods and two possible outcomes in each period . Having more periods can strengthen the results obtained here . As discussed in Section II , if the agent lives for multiple periods , the agent is willing to sacriﬁce even more output in the ﬁrst period by employing the new work method , since the information learned in the ﬁrst period can be used for a longer period of time . On the other hand , having multiple possible outcomes in each period may change some of the results . For example , if the new work method can produce a big success in the ﬁrst period , then it is possible that the optimal contract that implements exploration 38 rewards the big success in the ﬁrst - period . Two considerations justify the restriction to two possible outcomes . First , most of the studies on innovation point to the high rate of failure in innovative projects as the fundamental diﬀerence between innovative and traditional projects . If this is indeed the case , even with multiple possible outcomes in each period , the principal will still rely on reward for early failures , as it is the cheapest way to distinguish exploration from exploitation . Second , if the agent is risk - averse , then both rewards for failure and rewards for big successes will be used . Since the probability of a big success in the ﬁrst period when the agent employs the new work method is usually very low , we will see more often in practice rewards for failure than rewards for big successes . Lazear ( 1986 ) makes the distinction between input - based pay , where the principal compensates the agent based on the action taken by the agent , and output - based pay , where the principal compensates the agent based on the output produced by the agent . I assumed in this paper that the principal observes only the output produced by the agent , and consequently , can use only output - based pay . Prendergast ( 2002 ) argue that in uncertain environments , such as the innovation environment studied here , it is diﬃcult for the principal to evaluate the diﬀerent projects available to the agent , and therefore the principal delegates responsibilities to the agent , which in turn leads to output - based pay . Even in such uncertain environments though , a noisy signal about the action taken by the agent may be observable by the principal . One can show that if such signal is available for contracting , then the principal uses both input - based pay and output - based pay to compensate the agent . As the signal about the actions taken by the agent becomes more precise , the principal relies more on input - based pay , but still relies on output - based pay in the form studied in this paper . It is only in the extreme case in which the principal perfectly observes the actions taken by the agent that the principal does not rely on output - based pay . In the model , the agent chooses between a conventional technology , which has known probability of success , and a new technology , which has unknown probability of success . 39 In a strict interpretation , the model seems to apply better to mature ﬁrms ( with existing business to exploit ) . However , if one interprets the choice of the agent as a choice between more innovative and less innovative strategies , then it is easy to see that the model can also be applied to start - up companies , since entrepreneurs in those companies often face this type of decisions . The paper analyzes the problem of motivating innovation as an individual incentive problem . It is common that an individual , such as a manager in an organization , has to choose between more innovative or less innovative projects . Moreover , there are often performance measures associated with the outcomes of this choice which can be used to compensate this individual . Therefore , modeling the problem as an individual incentive problem seems reasonable and produces a rich set of predictions . Since innovation is often produced by teams of individuals working together on a problem it is interesting to study the team incentive problem . Ederer ( 2010b ) extends the model in this paper to allow for multiple agents and ﬁnds some new results that arise from the strategic interaction between members of the innovation team . X . Conclusion This paper proposes a framework to study the incentives for innovation . In this frame - work , innovation is the result of learning through the exploration of untested approaches that are likely to fail . Because of that , the optimal incentive scheme that motivates ex - ploration is fundamentally diﬀerent from standard pay - for - performance schemes used to motivate eﬀort . Tolerance ( or even reward ) for early failure , reward for long - term success , excessive continuation , commitment to a long - term incentive plan , and timely feedback on performance are all important ingredients to motivate exploration . Practices such as golden parachutes , managerial entrenchment , and debtor - friendly bankruptcy laws protect or even reward the agent when failure occurs . These practices 40 are often criticized , because by protecting or rewarding the agent after poor performance , they undermine the incentive for the agent to exert eﬀort . This paper shows that these practices may arise as part of an optimal incentive scheme that motivates exploration . Therefore , regulations that limit their use may in some cases have an adverse eﬀect on innovation . In order to assess the actual impact of such regulations , it remains to be studied empirically the actual contribution of these practices to innovation as well as the value of additional investments in innovation . There are several potentially interesting extensions of the theoretical model proposed here . For example , if the agent has superior information about his own type , then contracts may be used to sort agents . This raises a new issue : how to design contracts that attract creative workers while avoiding conventional workers and shirkers ? Answers to this problem could be relevant , for example , for ﬁrms trying to hire a turnaround manager , or simply trying to attract a more creative workforce . Another interesting question is the eﬀect of public versus private ownership on innovation . Earnings in public companies are transparent to the market , which may put pressure on the manager to meet short - term earnings expectations , potentially reducing incentives for innovation . I leave these questions for future research . Empirical research mentioned in the paper provides support to some of the results de - rived here . Some of the predictions of the model remain untested though , and additional empirical work seems warranted . For example , it would be interesting to investigate if the combination of stock options with long vesting periods , option repricing , golden parachutes , and managerial entrenchment is more prevalent in ﬁrms for which motivat - ing innovation is important . It would also be interesting to study whether more feedback is provided when the goal is to motivate exploration . The venture capital industry may be a natural place to test this hypothesis as venture capitalists are known to use their expertise to provide feedback to entrepreneurs . 41 A . Appendix The following deﬁnitions will be useful in stating the incentive compatibility constraints : V S ( ~ w , h i jk i ) = w S + E [ p j | S , i ] w SS + ( 1 − E [ p j | S , i ] ) w SF , V F ( ~ w , h i jk i ) = w F + E [ p k | F , i ] w FS + ( 1 − E [ p k | F , i ] ) w FF . Proof of Proposition 1 : The optimal contract ~ w that implements action plan h 1 1 1 i satisﬁes the following incentive compatibility constraints : ( p 1 − E [ p i ] ) ( V S ( ~ w , h 111 i ) − V F ( ~ w , h 111 i ) ) + E [ p i ] ( p 1 − E [ p j | S , i ] ) ( w SS − w SF ) + ( 1 − E [ p i ] ) ( p 1 − E [ p k | F , i ] ) ( w FS − w FF ) ≥ ( c 1 + p 1 c 1 + ( 1 − p 1 ) c 1 ) − ( c i + E [ p i ] c j + ( 1 − E [ p i ] ) c k ) . ( IC h i jk i ) First , I show that w F = w FF = w SF = 0 . Suppose w F > 0 or w FF > 0 . A contract ~ w ′ that is the same as ~ w but has w ′ F = 0 and w ′ FF = 0 satisﬁes all IC h i jk i and has W ( ~ w ′ , h 111 i ) < W ( ~ w , h 111 i ) . Suppose now that w SF > 0 . Let the contract ~ w ′ be the same as ~ w except that w ′ SF = 0 , w ′ SS = w SS − w SF and w ′ S = w S + w SF . The contract ~ w ′ satisﬁes all IC h i jk i , W ( ~ w ′ , h 111 i ) = W ( ~ w , h 111 i ) , but ~ w ′ pays the agent earlier than ~ w . I now argue that some incentive compatibility constraints are redundant . If ( i , j ) 6 = ( 1 , 1 ) , then it follows from IC h 110 i and IC h ij 1 i that IC h ij 0 i are redundant . If ( i , k ) 6 = ( 1 , 1 ) , then it follows from IC h 101 i and IC h i 1 k i that IC h i 0 k i are redundant . If h i jk i 6 = h 221 i and either 42 i = 2 , j = 2 , or k = 2 , then it follows from c 2 / c 1 ≥ ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) / ( p 1 − p 0 ) that IC h i jk i is redundant . Rewriting the incentive compatibility constraints that are not redundant : ( p 1 − p 0 ) w SS ≥ c 1 ( IC h 101 i ) ( p 1 − p 0 ) w FS ≥ c 1 ( IC h 110 i ) ( p 1 − p 0 ) w S + ( p 21 − p 0 p 1 ) w SS − ( p 21 − p 0 p 1 ) w FS ≥ c 1 ( IC h 011 i ) ( p 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) w S + ( p 21 − E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) w SS − ( p 21 − E [ p 2 ] p 1 ) w FS ≥ c 1 − c 2 + E [ p 2 ] ( c 1 − c 2 ) ( IC h 221 i ) I now show that IC h 101 i and IC h 110 i are binding . If that is not the case , then either ∆ 1 ≡ w SS − c 1 p 1 − p 0 > 0 or ∆ 2 ≡ w SF − c 1 p 1 − p 0 > 0 Let ~ w ′ be the same as ~ w except that w ′ SS = w SS − ∆ 1 , w ′ S = w S + p 1 ∆ 1 , w ′ FS = w FS − ∆ 2 , and w ′ F = w F + ( 1 − p 1 ) ∆ 2 . The contract ~ w ′ satisﬁes the above constraints , W ( ~ w ′ , h 111 i ) = W ( ~ w , h 111 i ) , and ~ w ′ pays the agent earlier than ~ w . The incentive compatibility constraints IC h 221 i and IC h 011 i become ( p 1 − p 0 ) w S ≥ c 1 ( IC h 011 i ) ( p 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) w S + E [ p 2 ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 ) c 1 p 1 − p 0 ≥ c 1 − c 2 + E [ p 2 ] ( c 1 − c 2 ) ( IC h 221 i ) If c 2 / c 1 ≥ β 1 then IC h 011 i is binding . Otherwise , IC h 221 i is binding . 43 Proof of Proposition 2 : The optimal contract ~ w that implements action plan h 221 i satisﬁes the following incentive compatibility constraints : ( E [ p 2 ] − E [ p i ] ) ( V S ( ~ w , h 221 i ) − V F ( ~ w , h 221 i ) ) + E [ p i ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − E [ p j | S , i ] ) ( w SS − w SF ) + ( 1 − E [ p i ] ) ( p 1 − E [ p k | F , i ] ) ( w FS − w FF ) ≥ ( c 2 + E [ p 2 ] c 2 + ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) c 1 ) − ( c i + E [ p i ] c j + ( 1 − E [ p i ] ) c k ) . ( IC h i jk i ) First , I show that w S = w SF = w FF = 0 . Suppose w S > 0 . Let ~ w ′ be the same as ~ w except that w ′ S = 0 , w ′ SS = w SS + w S E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − ǫ . There exists an ǫ > 0 such that the contract ~ w ′ satisﬁes all IC h i jk i and W ( ~ w ′ , h 221 i ) < W ( ~ w , h 221 i ) . Now suppose w SF > 0 . Let the contract ~ w ′ be the same as ~ w except that w ′ SF = 0 and w ′ SS = w SS + 1 − E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] w SF − ǫ . There exists an ǫ > 0 such that the contract ~ w ′ satisﬁes all IC h i jk i and W ( ~ w ′ , h 221 i ) < W ( ~ w , h 221 i ) . Finally , suppose w FF > 0 . If the contract ~ w ′ is the same as ~ w , except that w ′ FF = 0 , and w ′ F = w F + ( 1 − p 1 ) w FF , then all IC h i jk i are still satisﬁed , W ( ~ w ′ , h 221 i ) = W ( ~ w , h 221 i ) , and the contract ~ w ′ pays the agent earlier than ~ w . If follows from IC h 220 i and IC h ij 1 i that IC h ij 0 i and IC h ij 2 i are redundant . From IC h 220 i , we have that w FS ≥ c 1 p 1 − p 0 and IC h ij 1 i implies IC h ij 0 i . Since c 2 ≥ E [ p 2 ] − p 0 p 1 − p 0 c 1 , IC h ij 1 i implies IC h ij 2 i . Rewriting the incentive compatibility constraints that are not redundant : ( p 1 − p 0 ) ( w FS − w FF ) ≥ c 1 ( IC h 220 i ) ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 E [ p j ] ) w SS + ( p 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) w F + ( ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 1 − ( 1 − p 1 ) p 0 ) w FS ≥ ( c 2 + E [ p 2 ] c 2 + ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) c 1 ) − ( c 1 + p 1 c j ) ( IC h 1 j 1 i ) 44 ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 E [ p j ] ) w SS − ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) w F + ( ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 1 − ( 1 − p 0 ) p 0 ) w FS ≥ ( c 2 + E [ p 2 ] c 2 + ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) c 1 ) − p 0 c j ( IC h 0 j 1 i ) ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − E [ p j ] ) w SS ≥ c 2 − c j . ( IC h 2 j 1 i ) The incentive compatibility constraint IC h 220 i is binding and w FS = c 1 p 1 − p 0 . Suppose w FS > c 1 p 1 − p 0 . If the contract ~ w ′ is the same as ~ w , except that w ′ FS = c 1 p 1 − p 0 , and w ′ F = w F + ( 1 − p 1 ) ( w FS − w ′ FS ) , then all IC h ij 1 i are still satisﬁed , W ( ~ w ′ , h 221 i ) = W ( ~ w , h 221 i ) , and the contract ~ w ′ pays the agent earlier than ~ w . On the other hand , the incentive compatibility constraints IC h 121 i , IC h 101 i , IC h 211 i , and IC h 201 i are redundant . If c 2 ≥ c 1 , IC h 111 i implies IC h 121 i , and if c 2 < c 1 , IC h 121 i is trivially satisﬁed . Also , IC h 011 i and IC h 012 i imply IC h 101 i . Moreover , IC h 021 i implies IC h 201 i . Finally , IC h 111 i + p 1 − E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 ] − p 0 IC h 011 i implies IC h 211 i . If c 2 / c 1 ≥ β 2 , then one can show that w SS ≥ c 1 p 1 − p 0 ≥ c 1 − c 2 p 1 − E [ p 2 ] . Therefore , IC h 011 i implies IC h 001 i and IC h 021 i . Either w F > 0 , and IC h 111 i and IC h 011 i are binding or w F = 0 and IC h 111 i is binding . When IC h 111 i and IC h 011 i are binding , the contract is always feasible . Comparing the promised wages in each of the two possible contracts one can show that when 1 − E [ p 2 ] 1 − p 1 ≥ E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] p 21 , the former contract is less costly for the principal than the latter contract . Otherwise , the latter contract is less costly . If c 2 / c 1 < β 2 , then the candidate for the optimal contract is such that IC h 0 j 1 i and IC h 220 i are binding , w SS = w 0 j 1 SS , and w F = 0 , where j ∈ arg max ˜  ∈ { 0 , 1 } w 0˜  1 SS ≡ ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) c 2 − p 0 c ˜  ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 E [ p ˜  ] ) + ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) p 0 c 1 p 1 − p 0 ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 E [ p ˜  ] ) 45 I ﬁrst prove that the candidate contract is feasible . For that it suﬃces to show that IC h 111 i is satisﬁed . If E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ≥ p 21 , then IC h 011 i implies IC h 111 i . If E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] < p 21 , w 0 j 1 SS < ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) β 2 c 1 − p 0 c 1 ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 ) + ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) p 0 c 1 p 1 − p 0 ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 ) = ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) β 2 c 1 − ( 1 + p 1 ) c 1 ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 21 ) − ( p 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 0 c 1 p 1 − p 0 ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 ) < ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) c 2 − ( 1 + p 1 ) c 1 ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 21 ) − ( p 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 0 c 1 p 1 − p 0 ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 ) In addition to that , IC h 0 j 1 i is not satisﬁed for any w SS < w 0 j 1 SS . Therefore , it is impossible to improve on the candidate contract . Proof of Proposition 3 : Follows from the fact that IC h 101 i and IC h 110 i are binding under the optimal long - term contract . Proof of Proposition 4 : In order to implement h 221 i , the following incentive compati - bility constraints must be satisﬁed : ( E [ p 2 ] − E [ p i ] ) ( V S ( ~ w , h 221 i ) − V F ( ~ w , h 221 i ) ) + E [ p i ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − E [ p j | S , i ] ) ( w SS − w SF ) + ( 1 − E [ p i ] ) ( p 1 − E [ p k | F , i ] ) ( w FS − w FF ) ≥ ( c 2 + E [ p 2 ] c 2 + ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) c 1 ) − ( c i + E [ p i ] c j + ( 1 − E [ p i ] ) c k ) . ( IC h i jk i ) Moreover , for the contract to be renegotiation - proof , we must have j , k ∈ I such that IC h 2 j 1 i and IC h 22 k i bind . If c 2 ≥ E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 − p 0 c 1 , from IC h 211 i we have that w SS = c 2 − c 1 E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 w SF = 0 . 46 This contradicts IC h 111 i + p 1 − E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 ] − p 0 IC h 011 i . Therefore , h 221 i is not implementable with a sequence of short - term contracts if c 2 ≥ E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 − p 0 c 1 . If c 2 < E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 − p 0 c 1 , from IC h 201 i we have that w SS = c 2 E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 w SF = 0 . From IC h 22 k i , k ∈ { 0 , 2 } we have that w FS = c 1 p 1 − p 0 w FF = 0 Using the above equations we can rewrite the following incentive compatibility con - straints : w S ≥ c 2 ( 1 − p 0 ) E [ p 2 ] − p 0 + p 0 c 1 p 1 − p 0 ( IC h 021 i ) w S ≥ c 2 ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ( 1 − ( p 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) ) ) ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ) ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) − c 1 p 0 ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ) ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ) ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) + p 0 c 1 p 1 − p 0 ( IC h 011 i ) w S ≥ c 2 ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) + p 20 ) ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ) ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) + p 0 c 1 p 1 − p 0 ( IC h 00 k i ) It is easy to show that , given c 2 < E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 − p 0 c 1 , IC h 001 i implies IC h 011 i and IC h 021 i . There - fore , from IC h 001 i , our candidate for w S is w S = c 2 E [ p 2 ] − p 0 − p 0 c 2 E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 + p 0 c 1 p 1 − p 0 47 It can be shown that the candidate contract satisﬁes all other incentive compatibility constraints if and only if c 2 < ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ) ( 1 + p 1 ) ( p 1 − p 0 ) ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 E [ p 2 ] − p 0 + p 1 ) c 1 In this case , the sequence of short - term contracts derived above is the optimal sequence of short - term contracts . Proof of Proposition 5 : Similar to the proof of Proposition 2 . Proof of Corollary 1 : Follows from comparing the costs of implementing exploration and exploration with termination from the contracts derived in Propositions 2 and 5 . If c 2 / c 1 > max ( κ m , κ e ) β 2 + ( 1 − max ( κ m , κ e ) ) β 5 , then W ( ~ w 2 , h 221 i ) − W ( ~ w 5 , h 22 t i ) > ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 1 α 2 and there is ineﬃcient continuation with exploration . If c 2 / c 1 < max ( κ m , κ e ) β 2 + ( 1 − max ( κ m , κ e ) ) β 5 , then W ( ~ w 2 , h 221 i ) − W ( ~ w 5 , h 22 t i ) < ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 1 α 2 and there is in - eﬃcient termination with exploration . Proof of Proposition 6 : Action plan h 221 i can only be implemented if the principal provides feedback on performance to the agent . References Acemoglu , D . , S . Johnson , and J .

Bergemann and Valimaki ( 2006 ) survey the applications of bandit problems to economics . 3 This assumption is important because it implies that the principal will rely on output - based pay to provide incentives to the agent . I discuss in Section IX alternatives to the non - observability assumption and the consequences of relaxing it . 4 For simplicity , I assume that the agent has zero reservation utility . The participation constraints is thus not binding , since the agent has limited liability . 5 The other contracts that solve the above program are similar to the contract analyzed here except that the principal acts as a bank , keeping the wages of the agent to be paid later without obtaining any additional beneﬁts from this . The contract analyzed here is also the contract that arises if the agent is slightly more impatient than the principal . 6 The base case parameters used in all the ﬁgures are p 0 = 0 . 25 , E [ p 2 ] = 0 . 3 , p 1 = 0 . 5 , E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] = 0 . 7 , and c 1 = 1 . From Bayes’ rule , E [ p 2 | F , 2 ] = 0 . 129 . Each of the graphs in the ﬁgure corresponds to a wage paid to the agent in a particular contingency for diﬀerent values of c 2 / c 1 . When a node has no graphs , it is because the wage paid to the agent in that contingency is zero . 7 Hermalin and Katz ( 1991 ) show that an action is implementable if there does not exist a random - ization over actions that induces the same density over outcome and costs less to the agent . When c 2 / c 1 ≥ β 4 , a randomization over actions 0 and 1 induces the same density over ﬁrst - period outcome as action 2 and costs less to the agent . 8 In this context , implementing action plan h ijt i is the same as implementing action plan h ij 0 i with w FF = w FS = 0 . 9 Other research provide alternative rationale for the provision of feedback . Ederer ( 2010a ) shows that feedback may be useful when the agent is uncertain about his ability . Outside a principal - agent setting , Ray ( 2007 ) develops a model in which interim performance evaluation serves the purpose of screening bad projects . 56 10 See , for example , Bebchuk and Fried ( 2004 ) and “Rewards for Failure , ” British DTI consultation , June 2003 . 11 This extra surplus w F can be paid in the ﬁrst period , as in the optimal contract derived in Propo - sition 2 . Alternatively , the extra surplus w F may be paid only in the second period . Any such contract performs as well as the optimal long - term contract derived in Proposition 2 as long as after two periods an extra expected surplus w F is paid to the manager if he fails in the ﬁrst period . 12 Burkart , Gromb , and Panunzi ( 1997 ) and Myers ( 2000 ) develop models in which dispersed ownership serves as a way to reduce intervention by shareholders . 13 Lerner and Gompers ( 2004 ) describe in detail the practices used in the venture capital industry . 14 Landier ( 2002 ) develops a model with multiple equilibria in which the stigma of failure may prevent entrepreneurs from abandoning bad projects . 15 “CEO Challenge 2004 : Perspectives and Analysis , ” The Conference Board , Report 1353 . 57 Online Appendix for “Motivating Innovation” Gustavo Manso A . The Principal’s Choice Between Exploration and Exploitation This section studies the choice of the principal between motivating exploration and exploitation . In particular , it investigates the distortions that arise due to agency prob - lems . In the agency model studied in the paper , the principal chooses the action plan h i jk i that maximizes his expected proﬁt : Π ( h i jk i ) = R ( h i jk i ) − W ( ~ w ( h i jk i ) , h i jk i ) . Therefore , the principal chooses exploration over exploitation if and only if R ( h 221 i ) − W ( ~ w ( h 221 i ) , h 221 i ) > R ( h 111 i ) − W ( ~ w ( h 111 i ) , h 111 i ) If there were no agency problems , however , it would be optimal for the principal to choose exploration over exploitation if and only if R ( h 221 i ) − C ( h 221 i ) > R ( h 111 i ) − C ( h 111 i ) This corresponds to the ﬁrst - best decision criterion . The goal here will be characterize the distortions relative to the ﬁrst - best decision criterion that are produced by agency problems . This leads to the following deﬁnition : 1 Deﬁnition 3 The principal is biased against exploration if W ( ~ w ( h 221 i ) , h 221 i ) − C ( h 221 i ) > W ( ~ w ( h 111 i ) , h 111 i ) − C ( h 111 i ) and the principal is biased towards exploration if W ( ~ w ( h 221 i ) , h 221 i ) − C ( h 221 i ) < W ( ~ w ( h 111 i ) , h 111 i ) − C ( h 111 i ) The principal is biased against ( towards ) exploration when the extra cost of moti - vating exploration is greater ( lower ) than the extra cost of motivation exploitation . The following proposition establishes conditions under which the principal is biased against or towards exploration . Proposition 7 The principal is biased against exploration if c 2 / c 1 > β 2 and is biased towards exploration if c 2 / c 1 < β 2 . The intuition for the result is as follows . If c 2 / c 1 < β 2 , only shirking constraints are binding when implementing exploration . With learning the signal observed in the second period provides information about the action taken by the agent in the ﬁrst period and therefore exploration is relatively cheaper to implement than exploitation . If c 2 / c 1 > β 2 , however , the exploitation constraint binds when implementing exploration , making exploration relatively more expensive to implement than exploitation . Proof of Proposition 7 : The expected payment associated with exploitation is W ( ~ w 1 , h 111 i ) = p 1 " 2 α 1 + c 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) p 1 − E [ p 2 ] (cid:18) β 1 − c 2 c 1 (cid:19) + # , 2 while the expected payment associate with exploration is W ( ~ w 2 , h 221 i ) = ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 1 α 1 + E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] α 2 + E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] p 1 − p 0 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 p 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) c 1 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 21 (cid:18) c 2 c 1 − β 2 (cid:19) + if exploration is moderate , and W ( ~ w 2 , h 221 i ) = ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 1 α 1 + E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] α 2 + E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] E [ p 2 ] − p 0 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 p 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) c 1 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 E [ p 2 ] (cid:18) c 2 c 1 − β 2 (cid:19) + + ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) c 1 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 E [ p 2 ] (cid:18) c 2 c 1 − β 2 (cid:19) + . if exploration is radical . Therefore , the exact payments depend on four conditions : ( 1 ) The value of α 2 , ( 2 ) Whether β 1 is greater or less than c 2 / c 1 , and ( 3 ) Whether β 2 is greater or less than c 2 / c 1 . ( 4 ) Whether exploration is radical or moderate . The following deﬁnitions will be useful in simplifying the problem : α 20 = ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) c 2 + ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) p 0 α 1 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 20 , α 21 = ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) c 2 − p 0 c 1 + ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) p 0 α 1 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 . Under these deﬁnitions , α 2 = max { α 20 , α 21 } . Then α 20 − α 21 = p 0 ( c 1 E [ p 2 ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ) − c 2 ( p 1 − p 0 ) ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 20 ) ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 ) , 3 so α 20 − α 21 ≤ 0 if c 1 E [ p 2 ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ) ≤ c 2 ( p 1 − p 0 ) ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) , or , equivalently , E [ p 2 ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ) ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( p 1 − p 0 ) ≤ c 2 c 1 . In other words , α 2 = α 21 if E [ p 2 ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ) ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ( p 1 − p 0 ) ) ≤ c 2 c 1 , and α 2 = α 20 otherwise . It is thus easy to see that E [ p 2 ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ) ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( p 1 − p 0 ) < β 1 < β 2 . E [ p 2 ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ) ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( p 1 − p 0 ) < β 1 < β 2 . Moreover , one can note that as long as β 2 > c 2 c 1 , W ( ~ w 2 , h 221 i ) does not depend on whether exploration is radical or moderate . Therefore , depending on how large c 2 c 1 is compared to each of the three expressions above and on whether exploration is radical or moderate , the problem can be divided into ﬁve cases : Case Xm . c 2 c 1 ≥ β 2 , and exploration is moderate , Case Xr . c 2 c 1 ≥ β 2 , and exploration is radical , Case Y1 . β 1 ≤ c 2 c 1 < β 2 , Case Y2 . E [ p 2 ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ) ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( p 1 − p 0 ) ≤ c 2 c 1 < β 1 , and 4 Case Y3 . c 2 c 1 < E [ p 2 ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ) ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( p 1 − p 0 ) . The expected payment for each case is : Case Xm . Here α 2 = α 21 , β 1 < c 2 c 1 , β 2 ≤ c 2 c 1 , and exploration is moderate . W ( ~ w 1 , h 111 i ) = p 1 · 2 α 1 , W ( ~ w 2 , h 22 1 i ) = ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 1 α 1 + E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] α 21 + E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] p 1 − p 0 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 p 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) c 1 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 21 (cid:18) c 2 c 1 − β 2 (cid:19) Case Xr . Here α 2 = α 21 , β 1 < c 2 c 1 , β 2 ≤ c 2 c 1 , and exploration is radical . W ( ~ w 2 , h 221 i ) = ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 1 α 1 + E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] α 21 + E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] E [ p 2 ] − p 0 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 p 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) c 1 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 E [ p 2 ] (cid:18) c 2 c 1 − β 2 (cid:19) + ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) c 1 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 E [ p 2 ] (cid:18) c 2 c 1 − β 2 (cid:19) . Case Y1 . Here α 2 = α 21 , β 1 ≤ c 2 c 1 , and β 2 > c 2 c 1 . W ( ~ w 1 , h 111 i ) = p 1 · 2 α 1 , W ( ~ w 2 , h 221 i ) = ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 1 α 1 + E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] α 21 . 5 Case Y2 . Here α 2 = α 21 , β 1 > c 2 c 1 , and β 2 > c 2 c 1 . W ( ~ w 1 , h 111 i ) = p 1 (cid:20) 2 α 1 + c 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( p 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) (cid:18) β 1 − c 2 c 1 (cid:19)(cid:21) , W ( ~ w 2 , h 221 i ) = ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 1 α 1 + E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] α 21 . Case Y3 . Here α 2 = α 20 , β 1 > c 2 c 1 , and β 2 > c 2 c 1 . W ( ~ w 1 , h 11 1 i ) = p 1 (cid:20) 2 α 1 + c 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( p 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) (cid:18) β 1 − c 2 c 1 (cid:19)(cid:21) , W ( ~ w 2 , h 221 i ) = ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) p 1 α 1 + E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] α 20 . With some algebraic simpliﬁcation , the distortion ( W ( ~ w 2 , h 221 i ) − C ( h 221 i ) ) − ( W ( ~ w 1 , h 111 i ) − C ( h 111 i ) ) towards exploration under the ﬁve diﬀerent cases is : Case Xm . p 1 ( p 1 ( c 1 p 0 + c 2 ( p 1 − p 0 ) ) ( 1 + p 2 ) − c 1 ( 1 + p 1 ) E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) ( p 1 − p 0 ) ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 21 ) Case Xr . p 1 ( c 1 p 0 + c 2 ( p 1 − p 0 ) ) ( 1 + p 2 ) − c 1 ( 1 + p 1 ) E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ( p 1 − p 0 ) E [ p 2 ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 ) Case Y1 . p 0 ( p 1 ( c 1 p 0 + c 2 ( p 1 − p 0 ) ) ( 1 + p 2 ) − c 1 ( 1 + p 1 ) E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) ( p 1 − p 0 ) ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 ) 6 Case Y2 .

E [ p 2 ] ( p 1 − p 0 ) ( p 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) ( E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 20 ) × × (cid:18) c 2 ( p 1 − p 0 ) ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( p 1 E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 20 ) − c 1 (cid:18) p 30 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) + p 0 ( 1 + p 1 ) E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ( 1 + E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) + p 20 ( p 1 + E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) (cid:19)(cid:19) Each of the above expressions is increasing in c 2 c 1 . The next step is to ﬁnd the critical values of c 2 / c 1 that make each expression equal to zero . Denote these critical values by γ Xm , γ Xr , γ Y 1 , γ Y 2 , and γ Y 3 for each of the ﬁve cases . Solving for the critical values gives : 7 γ Xm = γ Xr = γ Y 1 = ( 1 + p 1 ) E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 p 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( p 1 − p 0 ) p 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) γ Y 2 = p 20 p 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) + p 1 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ( 1 + E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) ( p 0 − p 1 ) p 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( p 0 − E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) − p 0 ( p 21 + E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] + 2 p 1 E [ p 2 ] sp 2 ) ( p 0 − p 1 ) p 1 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( p 0 − E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) γ Y 3 = p 30 ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) + p 1 E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ( 1 + E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) ( p 0 − p 1 ) ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( p 20 − p 1 E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) − p 0 ( 1 + p 1 ) E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 20 ( p 1 + E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) ( p 0 − p 1 ) ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( p 20 − p 1 E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) It is straightforward to check that γ Y 1 = β 2 , γ Y 2 > β 1 , and γ Y 3 > E [ p 2 ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ) ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( p 1 − p 0 ) . Using these observations , one can reach conclusions about the distortions in each of the ﬁve cases : Cases Xm and Xr . Since c 2 c 1 ≥ β 2 and β 2 = γ Y 1 , we also have c 2 c 1 ≥ γ Y 1 , so the principal is biased against exploration . Case Y1 . Since c 2 c 1 < β 2 and β 2 = γ Y 1 , we also have c 2 c 1 < γ Y 1 , so the principal is biased towards exploration . 8 Case Y2 . Since c 2 c 1 < β 1 and β 1 < γ Y 2 , we also have c 2 c 1 < γ Y 2 , so the principal is biased towards exploration . Case Y3 . Since c 2 c 1 < E [ p 2 ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ) ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( p 1 − p 0 ) and E [ p 2 ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 0 ) ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( p 1 − p 0 ) < γ Y 3 , we also have c 2 c 1 < γ Y 3 , so the principal is biased towards exploration . B . Exploitation with Termination Proposition 8 The optimal contract ~ w 8 that implements exploitation with termination is such that w F = w SF = 0 , w SS = α 1 , and w S = ( 1 − p 0 ) α 1 + c 1 ( p 1 − p 0 ) ( p 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) (cid:18) β 1 − c 2 c 1 (cid:19) + . Proof of Proposition 8 : Similar to the proof of Proposition 1 . I now compare the total expected proﬁts of the principal when he implements ex - ploitation with the total expected proﬁts of the principal when he implements exploita - tion with termination . It is optimal for the principal to implement exploitation with termination instead of exploitation if R ( h 111 i ) − R ( h 11 t i ) < W ( ~ w 1 , h 111 i ) − W ( ~ w 8 , h 11 t i ) . ( 8 ) To keep the agent working in the second period after a failure in the ﬁrst period , the expected payments from the principal to the agent are equal to ( 1 − p 1 ) p 1 α 1 . It is thus 9 ex post eﬃcient for the principal to terminate the agent after a failure in the ﬁrst period if R ( h 111 i ) − R ( h 11 t i ) < ( 1 − p 1 ) p 1 α 1 . ( 9 ) When ( 9 ) holds , the beneﬁts from inducing the agent to work in the second period after a failure in the ﬁrst period are lower than the expected payments that the principal must make to the agent after a failure in the ﬁrst period to keep the agent working in the second period . Deﬁnition 4 There is excessive termination with exploitation if W ( ~ w 1 , h 111 i ) − W ( ~ w 8 , h 11 t i ) > ( 1 − p 1 ) p 1 α 1 . and there is excessive continuation with exploitation if W ( ~ w 1 , h 111 i ) − W ( ~ w 8 , h 11 t i ) < ( 1 − p 1 ) p 1 α 1 . There is excessive termination with exploitation if the actual threshold for termina - tion is higher than the ex post eﬃcient threshold for termination . There is excessive continuation with exploitation if the actual threshold for termination is lower than the ex post eﬃcient threshold for termination . Excessive continuation or termination may arise because the termination policy aﬀects the incentives for the agent’s ﬁrst - period action . Corollary 2 There is excessive termination with exploitation . Proof of Corollary 2 : Comparing the costs of implementing exploitation and exploita - tion with termination from the contracts derived in Propositions 1 and 8 , one obtains 10 that : W ( ~ w 1 , h 111 i ) − W ( ~ w 8 , h 11 t i ) = ( 1 − p 1 + p 0 ) p 1 α 1 > ( 1 − p 1 ) p 1 α 1 . There is ineﬃcient termination with exploitation . As shown in Proposition 8 , termination acts as a disciplinary device so that to imple - ment exploitation with termination the principal needs to pay the agent lower ﬁrst - period wages than to implement exploitation . There is excessive termination with exploitation because the lower wages paid to the agent oﬀset the losses from excessive termination . C . Exploitation without Feedback The following deﬁnitions will be useful in stating Proposition 9 : α 9 = 2 c 1 p 21 − p 20 , β 9 = E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 20 p 21 − p 20 . Proposition 9 To implement exploitation , it is optimal for the principal not to provide feedback on performance to the agent . The optimal contract that implements exploitation without feedback is such that w S = w F = w FF = 0 , w SF = w FS = ( p 1 + p 0 ) c 1 p 0 ( p 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) + E [ p 2 ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 ) (cid:18) β 9 − c 2 c 1 (cid:19) + , and w SS = α 9 − 2 ( 1 − p 1 − p 0 ) c 1 p 0 ( p 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) + E [ p 2 ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 ) (cid:18) β 9 − c 2 c 1 (cid:19) + . 11 Proof of Proposition 9 : For the no feedback policy to have any eﬀect the principal must set w S = w F , or otherwise the agent can infer the output in the ﬁrst period from the ﬁrst period wages . Therefore , the optimal contract ~ w that implements action plan h 111 i without feedback must have w S = w F and satisfy the following incentive compatibility constraints : ( p 1 − E [ p i ] ) ( V S ( ~ w , h 111 i ) − V F ( ~ w , h 111 i ) ) + E [ p i ] ( p 1 − E [ p j | S , i ] ) ( w SS − w SF ) + ( 1 − E [ p i ] ) ( p 1 − E [ p k | F , i ] ) ( w FS − w FF ) ≥ ( c 1 + p 1 c 1 + ( 1 − p 1 ) c 1 ) − ( c i + E [ p i ] c j + ( 1 − E [ p i ] ) c k ) ( IC h i jk i ) for all h i jk i 6 = h 111 i with j = k . First , I show that w S = w F = 0 . Suppose w S = w F > 0 . A contract ~ w ′ that is the same as ~ w but has w S = w F = 0 satisﬁes all the above constraints and has W ( ~ w ′ , h 111 i ) < W ( ~ w , h 111 i ) . Next , I show that w FF = 0 . Suppose that w FF > 0 . A contract ~ w ′ that is the same as ~ w but has w FF = 0 satisﬁes all the above constraints and has W ( ~ w ′ , h 111 i ) < W ( ~ w , h 111 i ) . Since c 2 / c 1 ≥ ( E [ p 2 ] − p 0 ) / ( p 1 − p 0 ) , IC h 011 i and IC h 000 i imply IC h 022 i . Similar arguments can be used to show that IC h 211 i , IC h 122 i and IC h 200 i are redundant . The remaining incentive compatibility constraints can be written as ( p 21 − p 20 ) w SS + ( p 1 ( 1 − p 1 ) − p 0 ( 1 − p 0 ) ) w SF + ( p 1 ( 1 − p 1 ) − p 0 ( 1 − p 0 ) ) w FS ≥ 2 c 1 ( IC h 000 i ) 12 ( p 21 − E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) w SS + ( p 1 ( 1 − p 1 ) − E [ p 2 ] ( 1 − E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) ) w SF + ( p 1 ( 1 − p 1 ) − ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) E [ p 2 | F , 2 ] ) w FS ≥ 2 ( c 1 − c 2 ) ( IC h 222 i ) ( p 21 − p 0 p 1 ) w SS + ( 1 − p 1 ) ( p 1 − p 0 ) w SF − p 1 ( p 1 − p 0 ) w FS ≥ c 1 ( IC h 011 i ) ( p 21 − p 0 p 1 ) w SS − p 1 ( p 1 − p 0 ) w SF + ( 1 − p 1 ) ( p 1 − p 0 ) w FS ≥ c 1 ( IC h 100 i ) Using Bayes’ rule the incentive compatibility constraint IC h 222 i can be written as ( p 21 − E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) w SS + ( p 1 ( 1 − p 1 ) − E [ p 2 ] ( 1 − E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) ) w SF + ( p 1 ( 1 − p 1 ) − E [ p 2 ] ( 1 − E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) ) w FS ≥ 2 ( c 1 − c 2 ) ( IC h 222 i ) I now show that we can restrict attention to contracts that have w SF = w FS . Suppose w SF 6 = w FS . Therefore , a contract ~ w ′ that has w ′ SF = w ′ FS = ( w SF + w FS ) / 2 satisﬁes all of the above incentive compatibility constraints and has W ( ~ w , h 111 i ) = W ( ~ w ′ , h 111 i ) . The candidate for the optimal contract is the one in the statement of Proposition 9 . If c 2 / c 1 ≥ β 9 then only IC h 0 0 0 i is binding . If c 2 / c 1 < β 9 , then both IC h 000 i and IC h 2 2 2 i are binding . One can check that IC h 100 i and IC h 011 i are satisﬁed under the optimal contract . If the principal does not provide feedback , then incentive compatibility constraints associated with exploration , shirking in the second period in case of a success in the ﬁrst period , and shirking in the second period in case of failure in the ﬁrst period , which are binding when interim performance is publicly observable , can be ignored . Therefore , it 13 is less costly to implement exploitation if information about interim performance is not revealed to the agent . The relevant incentive compatibility constraints are : ( p 21 − p 20 ) w SS + ( p 1 ( 1 − p 1 ) − p 0 ( 1 − p 0 ) ) w SF + ( ( 1 − p 1 ) p 1 + ( 1 − p 0 ) p 0 ) w FS ≥ 2 c 1 ( IC h 000 i ) ( p 21 − E [ p 2 ] E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) w SS + ( p 1 ( 1 − p 1 ) − E [ p 2 ] ( 1 − E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) ) w SF + ( ( 1 − p 1 ) p 1 + ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) E [ p 2 | F , 2 ] ) w FS ≥ 2 ( c 1 − c 2 ) ( IC h 222 i ) The optimal contract that implements exploitation without feedback has w SS ≥ w SF = w FS ≥ w FF = 0 . If c 2 / c 1 > β 9 , then IC h 000 i is binding , and incentives are provided through w SS only . If c 2 / c 1 < β 9 , then IC h 222 i is binding and w SS > w SF = w FS > 0 , since providing incentives only through w SS could induce the agent to try the new work method . 14
