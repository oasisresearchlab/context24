Interactions of ADF / cofilin , Arp2 / 3 complex , capping protein and profilin in remodeling of branched actin filament networks Laurent Blanchoin , Thomas D . Pollard and R . Dyche Mullins * Background : Cellular movements are powered by the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments . Actin dynamics are controlled by Arp2 / 3 complex , the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASp ) and the related Scar protein , capping protein , profilin , and the actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF , also known as cofilin ) . Recently , using an assay that both reveals the kinetics of overall reactions and allows visualization of actin filaments , we showed how these proteins co - operate in the assembly of branched actin filament networks . Here , we investigated how they work together to disassemble the networks . Results : Actin filament branches formed by polymerization of ATP – actin in the presence of activated Arp2 / 3 complex were found to be metastable , dissociating from the mother filament with a half time of 500 seconds . The ADF / cofilin protein actophorin reduced the half time for both dissociation of γ - phosphate from ADP – P i – actin filaments and debranching to 30 seconds . Branches were stabilized by phalloidin , which inhibits phosphate dissociation from ADP – P i – filaments , and by BeF 3 , which forms a stable complex with ADP and actin . Arp2 / 3 complex capped pointed ends of ATP – actin filaments with higher affinity ( K d ~ 40 nM ) than those of ADP – actin filaments ( K d ~ 1 µ M ) , explaining why phosphate dissociation from ADP – P i – filaments liberates branches . Capping protein prevented annealing of short filaments after debranching and , with profilin , allowed filaments to depolymerize at the pointed ends . Conclusions : The low affinity of Arp2 / 3 complex for the pointed ends of ADP – actin makes actin filament branches transient . By accelerating phosphate dissociation , ADF / cofilin promotes debranching . Barbed - end capping proteins and profilin allow dissociated branches to depolymerize from their free pointed ends . Background The assembly of actin filament networks at the leading edge of motile cells pushes forward the plasma membrane [ 1 , 2 ] . Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates actin filament branches and links the pointed end of the new daughter filament to the side of the mother filament , a mechanism that has been called dendritic nucleation [ 3 , 4 ] . Highly purified Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates poorly [ 3 , 5 ] but can be activated by ActA , the surface protein of the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes [ 6 ] , or by the carboxyl termini of members of the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASp ) / Scar family [ 7 , 8 ] . WASp / Scar proteins also bind a number of proteins thought to provide signals for actin polymerization [ 5 ] . A new assay using light microscopy to visualize branched actin filaments generated by the activated Arp2 / 3 complex reveals that these branches are metastable [ 4 ] . Here , we established that phosphate release from aged actin fila - ments favors dissociation of Arp2 / 3 complex from the pointed ends of filaments by showing that proteins of the actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF , also known as cofilin ) family promote both dissociation of γ - phosphate from ADP – P i - bound actin ( ADP – Pi – actin ) filaments and debranching . We also established that Arp2 / 3 complex has a lower affinity for the pointed ends of ADP - bound actin ( ADP – actin ) filaments than those of ATP - bound actin ( ATP – actin ) filaments . The products of debranching were long unbranched filaments , as short dissociated branches annealed rapidly unless they were capped at one end . We found that , if a barbed - end capping protein was present to block annealing and profilin was present to block addi - tion of dissociated actin subunits at free pointed ends , ADF / cofilin could depolymerize the free branches . We also found that ADF / cofilin binds Arp2 / 3 complex , another possible mechanism to promote disassembly . Results Using single turnover experiments [ 9 , 10 ] , we followed the time course of the dissociation of subunits from the ends of actin filaments . Filaments were assembled from actin monomers with a nucleotide ( ε ATP ) that has a higher flu - orescence when bound to actin monomers or filaments than when free .

Research Paper 1273 filaments into buffer containing excess unlabeled ATP , these monomers exchange ε ADP for unlabeled ATP , reducing the fluorescence regardless of whether or not the monomers repolymerize . All single turnover experi - ments reported here began with steady - state samples of approximately 7 . 4 µ M actin with capped barbed ends and free pointed ends at steady state . The rate of change of the fluorescence depends on the concentrations of free barbed and pointed ends and the concentration of unpolymerized actin available to add to these ends . In the simplest case for Mg – ATP monomers and filaments with no free barbed ends , rate = k + ( pointed ends ) ( free actin monomer ) – k – ( pointed ends ) . For Mg – ATP – actin in polymerization buffer , k + = 1 . 3 µ M – 1 sec – 1 and k – = 0 . 8 sec – 1 [ 11 ] , so at steady state the concentration of free Mg – ATP – actin monomer is 0 . 6 µ M , the concentration required to give equal associa - tion and dissociation rates . A positive rate indicates elon - gation , a negative rate shortening . The response of this steady state to the addition of excess unlabeled ATP depends on many factors . When un - labeled ATP was added to a steady state sample of fila - ments , the fluorescence changed only slowly ( Figure 1a , open triangles ) , as exchange of unlabeled for labeled sub - units at pointed ends is slow . On the other hand , when ATP was added with an excess of profilin ( Figure 1a , filled circles ) , the filaments depolymerized at a rate equal to k – ( pointed ends ) , as profilin binds tightly to ATP – actin monomers [ 12 ] and the complex does not elongate pointed ends [ 13 ] . Subunits dissociated but did not reassociate . The relevant dissociation rate constant was that for Mg – ADP – actin , 0 . 3 sec – 1 . Addition of a mixture of ATP , profilin and Arp2 / 3 complex ( to cap pointed ends ) slowed but did not stop profilin - induced dissociation of Mg – ADP – actin subunits from gelsolin - capped filaments ( Figure 1a , open circles ) , so Arp2 / 3 complex does not cap pointed ends tightly under these conditions . The ADF / cofilin protein actophorin also accelerated disas - sembly of gelsolin - capped filaments containing fluorescent actin subunits ( Figure 1b , filled circles ) . Severing ( increas - ing the concentration of ends ; [ 14 ] ) and / or faster subunit dissociation [ 15 ] may increase this rate . The fluorescence decreased faster when profilin was included with ATP and actophorin ( Figure 1b , filled squares ) , as profilin catalyzes exchange of ε ADP for unlabeled ATP on monomers and blocks dissociated monomers from elongating pointed ends [ 9 , 16 ] . Remarkably , 100 nM Arp2 / 3 complex had no effect on the time course of fluorescent subunit dissocia - tion by actophorin ( Figure 1b ) , either in the absence ( open circles ) or presence ( open squares ) of profilin . Thus , in the presence of profilin and / or actophorin , Arp2 / 3 complex caps depolymerizing ADP – pointed ends poorly , in spite of its ability to cap both polymerizing and depoly - merizing pointed ends [ 3 ] . We considered two possibilities : first , the nucleotide on subunits near the pointed end influences binding of Arp2 / 3 complex to the pointed end of actin filaments ; second , either actophorin or profilin may directly inhibit binding of Arp2 / 3 complex to pointed ends . Effect of nucleotide on capping of pointed and barbed filament ends We re - investigated capping of pointed ends by Arp2 / 3 complex using filaments capped on their barbed ends with gelsolin to isolate events at the pointed end . The amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex inhibits elongation of gelsolin - capped actin filaments by amoeba or muscle Mg – ATP – actin monomers in a concentration - dependent manner . The pointed end elongation rate of either amoeba and muscle Mg – ATP – actin as a function of Arp2 / 3 concentration gave an apparent K d of 41 ± 7 nM for amoeba complex and a 1274 Current Biology Vol 10 No 20 Figure 1 Effects of profilin , actophorin and Arp2 / 3 complex on the time course of dissociation of actin subunits from filaments capped on their barbed ends by gelsolin .

A fluorescence microscopy assay [ 4 ] confirmed efficient capping of pointed ends . We started with short gelsolin - capped filaments labeled red with rhodamine – phalloidin and added muscle actin monomers with Alexa green – phal - loidin to label new filaments green . The bicolor filaments in the control without Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 3a ) showed that actin elongated only the free pointed ends . The average length of the elongated green filaments was 0 . 7 µ m . A saturating concentration of amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex ( above the dissociation equilibrium constant for pointed ends ) prevented detectable growth from 90 % of gelsolin - capped filaments . Microscopy revealed a side reaction that accounted for the residual actin polymeriza - tion of gelsolin - capped filaments saturated with Arp2 / 3 complex to cap their pointed ends . A few filaments formed spontaneously , separate from the added capped seeds ( perhaps stimulated by the high concentration of Arp2 / 3 complex ) , grew long and aggregated into bundles [ 17 ] . These green filaments were so long that they must have grown from barbed ends . As they had no red segments , they did not form by annealing of seeds . As pointed ends grow so slowly , this side reaction gave an appreciable background of polymerization ( Figure 2a ) even though most of the seeds were capped on both ends by gelsolin and Arp2 / 3 complex . Bovine Arp2 / 3 complex also inhibited pointed - end elonga - tion by muscle ATP – actin monomers with a K d of 220 ± 100 nM and an efficiency of 60 % ( Figure 2a , filled circles ) . The microscopy assay confirmed this inhibition . The number of filaments growing ( 15 % ) and the length grown ( < 0 . 4 µ m ) in the presence of bovine Arp2 / 3 complex were very similar to the results with the amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex . As with the amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex , a few long filaments formed independently of the seeds in the pres - ence of the bovine Arp2 / 3 complex . This side reaction may explain the residual 40 % polymerization rate observed with seeds capped with gelsolin and bovine Arp2 / 3 complex . A similar experiment with bovine Arp2 / 3 complex by Ressad et al . [ 10 ] generated new barbed ends rather than capping pointed ends . In our hands and others [ 3 , 7 – 18 , 19 ] , neither amoeba nor bovine Arp2 / 3 complex generated many new barbed ends without an activator like the WASp - WA domain . The Ressad Arp2 / 3 complex , which was prepared by affinity chromatography on a WASp column [ 10 ] , may have been contaminated by a glu - tathione - S - transferase ( GST ) – WA fusion protein . In contrast to the situation in ATP , the amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex weakly inhibited elongation of gelsolin - capped filaments by amoeba Mg – ADP – actin monomers ( Figure 2a , open squares ) . The concentration dependence of inhibition of pointed - end elongation gave an apparent K d of ~ 1 µ M for amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex blocking pointed ends . Therefore , the affinity of the amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex for amoeba ADP – actin filament ends was more than 20 - fold lower than for amoeba ATP – actin filament ends . The microscopy assay revealed that , in ADP , either 1 . 1 µ M of amoeba ( Figure 3c ) or bovine ( data not shown ) Arp2 / 3 complex blocked growth at the pointed end of only 70 % of the gelsolin - capped actin seeds . These results provide the following insights about events at the pointed end . In ADP , Arp2 / 3 complex will dissoci - ate from and not rebind actin filament pointed ends during depolymerization . Even in ATP , Arp2 / 3 complex will not rebind providing that ATP – actin monomers are prevented from binding pointed ends by profilin . These properties explain both the lack of effect of Arp2 / 3 complex on depolymerization in the presence of Research Paper Disassembly of actin filament networks Blanchoin et al . 1275 Figure 2 Effect of nucleotide on capping of actin filament ends by Arp2 / 3 complex and capping protein . ( a ) Dependence of pointed - end capping on the concentration of Arp2 / 3 complex . Freshly prepared seeds consisting of short actin filaments capped on their barbed ends with gelsolin with 5 nM free pointed ends were incubated with a range of concentrations of bovine or amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex for 1 min in 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 10 mM imidazole pH 7 . 0 , with either 0 . 2 mM ATP or ADP . The time course of elongation was recorded after adding 1 . 4 µ M Mg – ATP – pyrenyl – actin or 1 . 4 µ M Mg – ADP – pyrenyl – actin to this mixture . The initial rate of increase of pyrene fluorescence was plotted as a function of the concentration of bovine Arp2 / 3 complex in ATP ( filled circles ) , or amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex in ATP ( filled squares , amoeba actin ; triangles , muscle actin ) or ADP ( open squares , amoeba actin ) .

They also highlight the importance of ATP hydrolysis and the rate - limiting release of phosphate from ADP – P i – actin sub - units for polymer stability in the presence of regulatory proteins . The situation at the barbed end was dramatically different . First , although capping protein bound better in ATP than ADP ( Figure 2b ) , this 2 - fold difference was small compared with the 40 - fold difference in affinity of Arp2 / 3 complex for ATP – and ADP – pointed ends . This emphasizes the sensitivity of Arp2 / 3 complex to the nucleotide on subunits at pointed ends . Second , barbed ends were more likely to have ATP than pointed ends in the presence of profilin because of exchange of ATP – sub - units and exchange of ATP from the medium with the terminal subunits at the barbed end [ 20 ] . Another series of microscopy experiments showed that the bovine Arp2 / 3 complex blocked all pointed ends of the daughter filaments at the branch point but that barbed - end capping by capping protein was intermittent ( Figure 3d ) . Experiments started with branched filaments labeled red with rhodamine – phalloidin . In the presence of 100 nM capping protein , muscle ATP – actin monomers elongated pointed ends rapidly and barbed ends slowly ( labeled green with Alexa green – phalloidin ) . Pointed ends growing faster than barbed ends is opposite to what happens with uncapped filaments . We never observed new filament growth at the pointed end of filaments at branch points . Thus , pointed ends residing at branches are capped more effectively by Arp2 / 3 complex than unbranched pointed ends . This observation also shows that branches rarely , if ever , form by Arp2 / 3 complex joining the pointed end of a preformed filament ( even a newly polymerized ATP – pointed end ) to the side of another filament . The fact that some barbed ends had short green extensions ( Figure 3d ) means that capping protein dissociates inter - mittently from barbed ends to allow for elongation or annealing . As growth on these barbed ends was short , recapping must be efficient or else barbed - end growth would have greatly exceeded pointed - end growth . From the concentration of capping protein and the association rate constant [ 21 ] , we estimated that the half time for capping protein to rebind was about 2 seconds , which is in agreement with the limited growth of barbed ends . Slow growth in the presence of saturating capping protein sug - gests that capping protein may dissociate from barbed ends faster than proposed previously ( t 1 / 2 = 30 minutes , [ 21 ] ) . Dissociation of branches during aging and depolymerization of dendritic networks As Arp2 / 3 complex bound ADP – pointed ends much more weakly than ATP – pointed ends , we examined how three factors that affect phosphate dissociation — phalloidin , BeF 3 and actophorin — affect the stability of actin fila - ment branches formed by Arp2 / 3 complex on the side of actin filaments ( Figure 4 ) . Phalloidin inhibits phosphate release [ 22 ] whereas actophorin promotes phosphate release [ 23 ] . BeF 3 substitutes for γ - phosphate , forming a much more stable complex with ADP and actin than phos - phate [ 24 ] . We assembled branched networks from con - centrations of pure actin and activated Arp2 / 3 complex that yielded branching density and lengths suitable for light microscopy . To follow the time course of any rearrangements in these samples , we terminated the reac - tions at intervals by adding rhodamine – phalloidin and 1276 Current Biology Vol 10 No 20 Figure 3 Visualization by fluorescence microscopy of the products generated by elongation of red - labeled ( a – c ) gelsolin - capped actin filament seeds or ( d ) branched filaments nucleated by Arp2 / 3 complex .

Phalloidin conjugated to Alexa green ( Alexa green – phalloidin ) was present during the elongation to stabilize the new filaments . Samples were prepared by dilution and application to a cover slip . ( a ) Gelsolin - capped seeds ( 5 nM ) stabilized with rhodamine – phalloidin were incubated with 1 µ M Mg – ATP – actin for 15 min in the presence of Alexa green – phalloidin and with an additional 1 µ M Mg – ATP – actin for 15 min .

Dendritic networks of filaments assembled from muscle Mg – ATP – actin and activated bovine Arp2 / 3 complex in ATP buffer de - branched spontaneously with a half time of about 500 seconds ( Figure 4a – c , g ; open circles ) . The frac - tion of branched filaments at each time point varied between experiments because of experimental factors that we cannot yet fully control , but the mean values gave a reliable estimate of the time course , which is similar to the time course of phosphate release under these conditions [ 23 , 25 ] . Remarkably , short branched filaments were con - verted to long unbranched filaments in this experiment . The most likely mechanism to account for the change of length is rapid end - to - end annealing of the short dissoci - ated branches , as the concentration of polymerized actin is constant during this time [ 19 ] . The alternative mechanism of subunit redistribution between filaments is unlikely because of the slow rate of ADP – subunit dissociation ( 8 sec – 1 at barbed ends and < 1 sec – 1 at pointed ends ) . As annealing requires a free barbed end and a free pointed end , pointed ends must dissociate from Arp2 / 3 complex during debranching . Two factors that stabilized the ADP – P i state of actin poly - mers , BeF 3 ( Figure 4h ) and phalloidin [ 4 ] , slowed the time course of de - branching . BeF 3 extended the half time for de - branching to over 2000 seconds . Phalloidin stabilized branches for hours [ 4 ] . These control experiments show that two agents that reduce the rate of phosphate release from actin filament also slow dissociation of branches . Actophorin accelerated de - branching more than 10 - fold ( Figure 4g , filled circles ) compared with controls . Again , densely branched networks of short filaments were rapidly converted to long unbranched filaments ( Figure 4d – f ) , sug - gesting that in these experiments annealing of short fila - ments is faster than severing or depolymerization . Actophorin promotes dissociation of γ - phosphate from ADP – P i – actin filaments [ 23 ] . Under the conditions of these de - branching experiments , the MESG assay for phosphate release [ 23 , 25 , 26 ] confirmed that actophorin promotes phosphate dissociation from filament networks formed by activated Arp2 / 3 complex , similar to the effect of actophorin on unbranched filaments . The half time for phosphate release with 40 µ M actophorin was about 30 seconds . Binding of actophorin to Arp2 / 3 complex We studied the interaction of actophorin with the amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex by chemical cross - linking and analytical ultracentrifugation . Using conditions known to cross - link profilin to Arp2 / 3 complex [ 17 ] , the zero - length cross - linker EDC together with NHS ( see Materials and methods ) cross - linked 35 S - labeled actophorin to Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 5 ) . The major cross - linked band containing 35 S - labeled actophorin ran at ~ 58 kDa ( Figure 5a ) and reacted with antibodies to the p40 ( ARPC1 ) subunit of Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 5b ) , as expected from the size of the product . A fainter doublet of bands containing 35 S - labeled actophorin ran at ~ 68 kDa and reacted with anti - bodies to Arp2 . Another band with 35 S - labeled actophorin at about 34 kDa could be actophorin cross - linked to the p14 , p18 or p19 subunits of Arp2 / 3 complex . We used sed - imentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation [ 17 ] to measure the affinity of rhodamine - labeled actophorin S88C mutant to Arp2 / 3 complex ( data not shown ) . Least - squares fitting [ 17 ] gave a K d of 12 µ M for actophorin binding to Arp2 / 3 complex .

As far as we know , all disassem - bly takes place at the ends of actin filaments where elon - gation and shortening are fully explained by the simple relationship : rate = k + ( ends ) ( free actin monomer ) – k – ( ends ) . However , the relationship is made complicated by the fol - lowing : the two ends of filaments differ in kinetic proper - ties ; nucleotide bound to actin monomers ( ADP or ATP ) or subunits in actin filaments ( ATP , ADP – P i or ADP ) influence reaction rates and interactions with regula - tory proteins ; at least at the barbed end , nucleotide in the medium appears to exchange with nucleotide on ter - minal subunits ; regulatory proteins ( profilin , thymosin , ADF / cofilin ) bound to monomers influence their reactions with nucleotides and the ends of filaments ; and capping / uncapping , severing / annealing and branching / de - branch - ing all influence the concentrations of ends . Even in the minimal system required to reconstitute assembly of actin comet tails by bacteria [ 27 ] , five different proteins partici - pate : actin , Arp2 / 3 complex , profilin , ADF / cofilin and capping protein . Each has an optimal concentration and their inter - relationships are extensive and sometimes subtle ( reviewed in [ 28 ] ) . For example , to cap barbed ends effec - tively , capping protein requires profilin to suppress its ten - dency to nucleate new pointed ends , because , if unchecked , this side reaction consumes all of the capping protein [ 4 ] . The present study of depolymerization reactions yielded four main findings . First , dissociation of γ - phosphate from actin filament branches weakens the interaction of the pointed end of the branch with Arp2 / 3 complex . It also causes the branch to dissociate and , by preventing recap - ping , probably contributes to making depolymerization of ADP – actin filament subunits from pointed ends proces - sive . Second , actophorin promotes de - branching by accel - erating the rate - limiting release of phosphate from ADP – P i – actin filament subunits . Third , if their barbed ends are not capped , dissociated branches rapidly anneal , perhaps contributing to the pool of long unbranched fila - ments observed in cells . Fourth , provided that most barbed ends are capped , actophorin and profilin dissociate ADP – actin filament subunits from free pointed ends and recycle them back to the profilin – ATP – actin pool , ready to elongate new barbed ends created by Arp2 / 3 complex . Although this work is a step towards understanding disas - sembly , we are impressed by the complexity of the reac - tions and expect that surprises lie ahead . Nevertheless , our findings do explain how cells achieve endwise disassembly of actin filaments in the presence of high concentrations of proteins that cap both barbed ends ( capping protein , gel - solin ) and pointed ends ( Arp2 / 3 complex , tropomodulin ) of actin filaments and inhibit dissociation of subunits . Our findings also explain why filament ends created by ADF / cofilin shorten rather than anneal or become capped , and what makes the shortening processive . De - branching mechanism Our central finding is that Arp2 / 3 complex binds the pointed end of ATP – actin filaments with much higher affinity ( K d ~ 40 nM ) than ADP – pointed ends ( K d ~ 1 µ M ) . In ATP , saturating concentrations of the amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex inhibited pointed - end elongation by 95 % on the basis of the absence of visible growth at the pointed end of most filaments and slow or intermittent growth on the remainder . Pointed - end capping by Arp2 / 3 complex at branches was absolute . In ADP , the lower affinity of Arp2 / 3 complex for pointed ends allowed growth of 30 % of gelsolin - capped actin seeds in the pres - ence of 1 . 1 µ M complex . The difference in the affinity of Arp2 / 3 complex for ATP – and ADP – pointed ends provides a mechanism for de - branching , and explains the effects of phalloidin , BeF 3 1278 Current Biology Vol 10 No 20 Figure 5 Products of cross - linking Acanthamoeba actophorin to Arp2 / 3 complex .

All of the data are consistent with phosphate dissociation from the pointed end of the branch being the key event in chang - ing the affinity and with the de - branching reaction being dissociation of the pointed end from Arp2 / 3 complex , which may or may not remain associated with the mother filament . Nevertheless , more detailed mechanistic studies are desirable in the future . In principle , the nucleotide state of the mother filament and of Arp2 / 3 complex might also influence the stability of the branch point . However , the frequency of branching from ADP – filaments is approximately the same as from newly polymerized fila - ments ( ATP – filaments and ADP – P i – filaments ) [ 4 ] , suggest - ing that the lateral interaction with the mother filament is less sensitive to the nucleotide in the filament . As irreversible ATP hydrolysis [ 29 ] followed by slow dis - sociation of the γ - phosphate [ 30 ] are inevitable following polymerization of ATP – actin , de - branching may also be inevitable , although external factors may influence the rate of these reactions . The first example is the ability of ADF / cofilin to accelerate de - branching . The ability of actophorin to promote phosphate dissociation from ADP – P i – actin filaments is sufficient to explain its effect on de - branching , but actophorin may influence de - branching and disassembly in other ways . Binding of actophorin to Arp2 / 3 complex , although weak , may reduce the affinity of Arp2 / 3 complex for pointed ends . In addi - tion , the conformational change induced when ADF / cofil - ins bind actin filaments [ 31 ] may dissociate Arp2 / 3 complex from filament ends or sides . This conformational change may also influence binding of capping protein to barbed ends . On the other hand , WASp / Scar proteins may stabilize branches by interacting with both Arp2 / 3 complex and actin . All of these possibilities deserve more detailed investigation . Response of filaments and branched networks to actophorin and profilin Much previous work considered how individual actin - binding proteins interact with actin monomers and fila - ments , but it is now clear that understanding actin filament turnover in cells requires insights about ensembles of regu - latory proteins . This task is built on knowledge of the indi - vidual reactions , but light microscopy has revealed that it is much more complex than one might have anticipated . We have found that the responses of actin filaments and branched actin filament networks to actophorin and profilin involve not only effects on subunit dissociation at filament ends [ 15 ] and severing [ 14 , 23 , 32 , 33 ] , but also effects of ADF / cofilin on the rate of phosphate dissociation , de - branching , capping and annealing . Capping is particularly important . Barbed - end capping is required for profilin to sequester ATP – actin monomers [ 34 ] , but it also prevents annealing of filaments [ 35 ] created by severing or de - branching , allowing these free pointed ends to disassemble . Thus barbed - end capping is essential for effective disas - sembly of pointed ends . Addition of actophorin to uncapped filaments results in severing , but the mean length of the fil - aments reaches a plateau with time [ 23 , 32 ] . We postulated that this steady state results from a balance between the rates of severing and annealing . The light micrographs in this paper confirmed annealing , but its rate and extent need further quantitative studies . Given the impressive annealing observed by light microscopy , we expect that previous solu - tion studies underestimated the extent of severing . Light microscopy with immobilized filaments [ 14 , 33 ] may have given a more accurate account of severing . Addition of pro - filin to uncapped filaments has no effect on actin monomer or polymer concentrations , but most of the actin monomer binds profilin . Addition of actophorin and profilin to uncapped filaments promotes subunit flux from filaments to ADP – actin – actophorin to ATP – actin – profilin and back to free barbed ends [ 15 , 16 , 23 ] . Research Paper Disassembly of actin filament networks Blanchoin et al . 1279 Figure 6 Model . Weak binding of actophorin to ADP – P i – actin subunits accelerates phosphate release and promotes further actophorin binding . The low affinity of Arp2 / 3 for ADP – pointed ends results in de - branching of actin filaments , creates free ends for depolymerization and makes depolymerization processive by limiting re - capping of ADP – pointed ends . Severing by actophorin generates additional pointed ends , which depolymerize provided barbed ends are capped and profilin is present to sequester monomers . 1 . ADF / cofilin promotes phosphate release from ADP – Pi actin filaments 2 . ADF / cofilin binds and severs ADP – actin filaments creating a barbed end and a pointed end 3 . ADP - containing pointed ends dissociate from Arp2 / 3 complex creating a new free pointed end Potential sites of subunit dissociation Current Biology Capping barbed ends influences all of these reactions . Capping blocks both association and dissociation of sub - units at the barbed end , and as actin – profilin does not associate with pointed ends , the only reaction allowed is dissociation at pointed ends , eventually depolymerizing the filaments ( Figure 1a ) . The combination of actophorin and profilin depolymerizes capped filaments faster because of severing and possibly enhanced ADP – actin dissociation from pointed ends ( Figure 1b ) . Actophorin has a special effect on filaments with Arp2 / 3 complex branches , but otherwise the effects of profilin and / or actophorin on branched actin filament networks closely parallel their effects on unbranched actin filaments . By promoting phosphate dissociation ( and possibly by other mechanisms considered above ) , actophorin accelerates de - branching , creating short filaments with free pointed ends . If free barbed ends are available , the short dissociated branches anneal rapidly to form long unbranched filaments . This side reaction will affect the observation of the early time course of branch dissociation . Consequently , we prob - ably underestimated the extent of debranching , but ADF / cofilin clearly promoted debranching ( Figure 4g ) . If capping protein is present , capping and annealing will compete . Although all filaments near the leading edge are branched , annealing of dissociated branches may contribute to the formation of longer unbranched filaments found deeper in the cytoplasm . De - branching and annealing may also contribute to formation of bundles of long actin fila - ments in the cortex and filopodia . If the rate of barbed - end capping exceeds the rate of annealing , free pointed ends will be available for disassembly by actophorin and profilin , recycling actin back to the profilin – actin pool . Although clear in broad outline , essentially every reaction on these pathways needs more work . For example , having established the existence of both severing by actophorin and annealing of the fragments , the rates of these reactions need to be determined . With that understood , it should be possible to evaluate more rigorously exactly how fast branches dissociate , how fast actophorin – ADP – actin disso - ciates from free pointed ends and to learn if the combina - tion of severing and enhanced dissociation account fully for the turnover of filaments in the presence of actophorin ( and profilin ) . As most of the components in the system appear to be interchangeable across the phylogenetic tree , we expect that the basic mechanisms have been conserved , as Acanthamoeba branched from the main line of eukaryotes more than 1 billion years ago . Nevertheless , comparative studies are needed to confirm that higher organisms use the same mechanisms as amoeba . Conclusions The effect of bound nucleotide on capping of pointed ends allows Arp2 / 3 complex and ATP – actin monomers to form a stable , rigid , but temporary branch on the side of another actin filament ( Figure 6 ) . Assembly of the branched network is favored near the plasma membrane where prenylated GTP - bound Cdc42 and phosphatidyl - inositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) activate WASp to stimulate nucle - ation by Arp2 / 3 complex . Deeper in the cytoplasm , inevitable hydrolysis of bound ATP and dissociation of phosphate lead to de - branching and processive depolymer - ization of the pointed end of the ADP – filament , provided that most barbed ends are capped ( to prevent annealing and to maintain the profilin – actin pool ) and that profilin is avail - able to sequester dissociated subunits . Thus phosphate dis - sociation from polymerized ADP – P i – actin is a key event in giving a direction to the whole cycle of actin assembly and recycling . ATP hydrolysis is the only irreversible step , but as actin filaments containing ATP or ADP – P i are identical in every aspect measured , it is the subsequent dissociation of phosphate that initiates disassembly . Actophorin pro - motes filament turnover by dissociating phosphate from ADP – P i – filaments ( enhancing actophorin binding and dis - sociating Arp2 / 3 complex from pointed ends ) . Actophorin also contributes through severing , which makes more ADP – pointed ends , and by dissociating ADP – subunits . Materials and methods Reagents DTT , EDTA , Tris , sodium azide , DMSO , hexokinase , ATP , ADP , phal - loidin , and Sephadex G - 25 medium were from Sigma ; Tris - ( 2 - car - boxyethyl ) phosphine , tetramethylrhodamine maleimide 5 ′ isomer ( TCEP ) , and Alexa green – phalloidin were from Molecular Probes ; 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) - carbodiimide hydrochloride ( EDC ) , and N - hydroxy - succinimide ( NHS ) were from Pierce ; DEAE – cellulose DE - 52 was from Whatman ; and rhodamine – phalloidin was from Fluka . Protein purification Acanthamoeba actin was purified from DEAE column fractions by poly - merization – depolymerization and gel filtration [ 36 ] and stored in Buffer G ( 2 mM Tris - Cl pH 8 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM azide ) . Actin was labeled on Cys374 to a stoichiometry of 0 . 8 – 1 . 0 with pyrene iodoacetamide ( [ 37 ] as modified by [ 36 ] ) and diluted with nine parts of unlabeled actin for polymerization assays . Mg – ATP – actin monomers were prepared on ice by addition of 0 . 2 mM EGTA and 11 - fold molar excess of MgCl 2 over actin and used within hours . Mg – ADP – actin monomers were prepared by treatment of Mg – ATP – actin monomers with soluble hexokinase and glucose [ 36 ] . ADP – BeF 3 actin filaments were prepared by polymerizing 20 µ M Mg – ATP – actin in 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM NaF , 150 µ M BeCl 2 at room temperature for 4 h [ 24 ] . Wild - type actophorin and the S88C mutant of actophorin [ 16 ] in plasmid vector pMW172 were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS and purified [ 38 ] with 2 mM DTT in all buffers to avoid cysteine oxidation . Purified actophorins were stored in 10 mM Tris - Cl pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 2 mM DTT , 1 mM NaN 3 . Actophorin S88C was labeled with tetramethylrho - damine maleimide 5 ′ isomer and purified [ 16 ] . Actophorin was labeled with 35 S according to Gao et al . [ 39 ] . Arp2 / 3 complex was purified from Acanthamoeba by ion exchange on DEAE followed by poly - L - proline affinity chromatography [ 40 ] , or from bovine thymus [ 5 ] . Recombinant plasma gelsolin was purified according to Yu et al . [ 41 ] . Acanthamoeba profilin - I was purified by poly - L - proline affinity chromatography [ 42 ] . Acanthamoeba capping protein was purified according to Cooper et al . [ 43 ] . Recombinant WASp - WA domain was purified from E . coli [ 5 ] . Polymerization assays Polymerization buffer contained 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM imidazole pH 7 . 0 and , except where noted , actin buffer G . We 1280 Current Biology Vol 10 No 20 formed gelsolin - capped actin seeds as described by Mullins et al . [ 3 ] . Briefly , we incubated purified recombinant plasma gelsolin with a twofold molar excess of Acanthamoeba or muscle actin ( Buffer : 200 – 400 µ M CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 2 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 ) for 2 h at room tem - perature followed by an overnight incubation at 4°C ( this step is essential as gelsolin - capped actin dimers form quite slowly ) . We warmed these gel - solin - capped actin dimers to room temperature , added a fivefold excess of actin and then adjusted the buffer to 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM Imidazole pH 7 . 0 by adding 0 . 1 volume of a 10 × stock solution . We quantified the number of free pointed ends by elongation assays using known concentrations of pyrenyl – actin . We verified that seeds prepared in this manner contained no free barbed ends by adding profilin to the elongation reaction . When the percentage of pyrene - labeled actin was low , 1 – 5 % excess profilin completely inhibited elongation from our gelsolin - capped actin seeds . In our experience , gelsolin - capped seeds formed this way and stored on ice are good for up to 5 days . Light microscopy assay Actin at 4 µ M was polymerized under the conditions specified in the figure legends , labeled with rhodamine – phalloidin during polymeriza - tion or at an indicated time point thereafter and diluted for observation to a final concentration of 10 nM in fluorescence buffer containing 10 mM imidazole pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM DTT , 100 µ g / ml glucose oxidase , 3 mg / ml glucose , 20 µ g / ml catalase , 0 . 5 % methylcellulose [ 4 ] . A dilute sample of 2 µ l was applied to a 22 × 22 mm coverslip coated with 0 . 1 % nitrocellulose in amyl acetate . Actin filaments were observed by epi - fluorescence illumination with an Olympus IX - 70 microscope and digital images were collected with a Hamamatsu ORCA CCD camera using Metamorph software . Analysis of the images was done using Metamorph software . Filament turnover assay Dissociation of subunits from filaments labeled with fluorescent nucleotide ( ε ATP ) was measured in single turnover experiments [ 9 , 10 ] . Dissociation of fluorescent subunits from the ends of filaments did not change the fluorescence , but in the presence of an excess of unlabeled ATP in the buffer , ε ATP exchanged for ATP with an irreversible reduc - tion in fluorescence regardless of subsequent reactions . Chemical cross - linking Stock solutions of 100 mM EDC and NHS were made fresh in dry DMSO immediately before use . The final concentration of DMSO in all reactions was 10 % . Reactions were carried out for 1 h at room temper - ature and quenched by addition of 100 mM glycine , 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 .
