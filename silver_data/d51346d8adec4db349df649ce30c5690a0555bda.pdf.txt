BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY Prenatal acoustic communication programs offspring for high posthatching temperatures in a songbird Mylene M . Mariette * and Katherine L . Buchanan In many species , embryos can perceive and learn external sounds . Yet , the possibility that parents may use these embryonic capacities to alter their offspring ’ s developmental trajectories has not been considered . Here , we demonstrate that zebra finch parents acoustically signal high ambient temperatures ( above 26°C ) to their embryos . We show that exposure of embryos to these acoustic cues alone adaptively alters subsequent nestling begging and growth in response to nest temperature and influences individuals ’ reproductive success and thermal preferences as adults . These findings have implications for our understanding of maternal effects , phenotypic plasticity , developmental programming , and the adaptation of endothermic species to a warming world . B y shaping offspring phenotype to the en - vironment experienced by the mother , ma - ternal effects have the capacity to alter population dynamics in fluctuating envi - ronments ( 1 – 3 ) . Maternal effects , as other forms of phenotypic plasticity , may therefore pro - vide a mechanism for species ’ persistence under global warming ( 4 , 5 ) . In particular , parental ef - fects may improve offspring thermal acclimation ( 6 ) and optimize offspring growth in current tem - perature regimes , as demonstrated in inverte - brates ( 7 ) and recently in ectothermic vertebrates ( 8 ) . Whether parents in endothermic species can program their offspring for current climatic con - ditions is currently unknown . Here , we investigated whether avian parents can signal environmental conditions to their em - bryos , allowing them to adaptively modulate their growth in response to temperature . Because , in birds , mothers can no longer affect the bio - chemical environment of their embryos after laying , we tested the possibility that parents sig - nal current climatic conditions via acoustic cues . Indeed , parents call to their eggs during incu - bation in several bird species ( 9 – 11 ) , and late - stage avian embryos can perceive , and even produce , sound ( 12 – 15 ) . Prenatal acoustic com - munication , mostly in precocial birds , has been found to synchronize hatching ( 14 ) , allow em - bryos to solicit parental incubation ( 12 , 15 ) , and improve imprinting , perceptual learning , and brain functions ( 16 – 18 ) , although the direct fit - ness impact of these effects has not been quan - tified . Recent studies in two species of fairy wrens ( Malurus spp . ) showed that nestlings imitate the call of their foster incubating mother , and provisioning mothers tend to discriminate against foreign - sounding nestlings ( 10 , 11 ) . Therefore , by altering nestling begging , incubation call - ing may have the potential to function sim - ilarly to other avian maternal effects , such as yolk hormone content that modifies nestling begging and growth ( 3 , 19 , 20 ) . Yet , whether parents signal environmental conditions and alter the developmental trajectory of their off - spring using prenatal acoustic communication is unknown . TheAustralianzebrafinch ( Taeniopygiaguttata ) is an arid - adapted songbird that breeds opportun - isticallyinfluctuatingtemperatureregimes ( 21 ) and inwhichnestling mass before fledging varies by up to 30 % , depending on nesting density ( 22 ) and parental care coordination ( 23 ) . We iden - tified that , in outdoor aviaries , wild - derived zebra finchesproducedan “ incubationcall ” while alone with their eggs ( real or dummy ) with their partner away from the nest ( 24 ) ( fig . S1 ) . This call was exclusively uttered toward the end of the incubation period , within 5 days of hatching ( Fig . 1A ) ( time to expected hatch date : linear : Z = 2 . 19 , P = 0 . 03 ; quadratic : Z = – 2 . 38 , P = 0 . 02 , n = 266 recordings ) ( table S1 ) , and calling rate per hour increased closer to expected hatch date ( table S1 ) . In addition , incubation calling was very clearly associated with elevated ambient temperatures , occurring only when maximal daily temperature rose above 26°C ( Z = 2 . 81 , P = 0 . 005 , n = 266 ) ( Fig . 1B ) , regardless of seasonal varia - tion ( fig . S2 and table S1 ) . Therefore , as suggested in fairy wrens ( 10 , 11 , 25 ) , zebra finch parents appear to control the production of incubation calls to signal environmental conditions to their embryos , because calling only occurred close to hatching , rather than as a spontaneous reac - tion to heat . To investigate experimentally whether this calling behavior may prepare offspring for high ambient temperatures , eggs were artificially in - cubated at a standard temperature ( 37 . 7°C ) and exposed to acoustic playback of either incuba - tion calls ( “ treatment ” ) or control contact calls in the last 5 days of incubation ( fig . S1 ) ( 24 ) . Nestlings hatched in the incubators were then returned to the aviary to be raised in nest boxes with naturally contrasting temperature pro - files , depending on sun exposure throughout the day . Nestlings exposed to incubation calls as embryos followed a different growth pattern in response to nest temperature than did control nestlings : Treatment nestling mass ( and to a lesser extent tarsus length ) on day 13 decreased with nest temperature , whereas it increased in control nestlings ( Fig . 2 ) ( mass : t = – 3 . 30 , P = 0 . 001 , n = 130 nestlings from 45 broods ) ( tables S2 and S3 ) . This effect at the end of the nestling period ( day 13 ) was already arising just 1 day 812 19 AUGUST 2016 (cid:127) VOL 353 ISSUE 6301 sciencemag . org SCIENCE Centre for Integrative Ecology , School of Life and Environmental Sciences , Deakin University , Waurn Ponds Campus , 75 Pigdons Road , Waurn Ponds VIC 3216 , Australia . * Corresponding author .

RESEARCH | REPORTS after hatching [ linear mixed model ( LMM ) on mass at day 1 : t = – 2 . 18 , P = 0 . 032 , n = 125 nestlings from 45 broods ] and was observed throughout nestling development ( same interac - tion on two random subsamples : 2 days post - hatching : t = – 2 . 20 , P = 0 . 0037 , n = 61 nestlings from 30 broods ; and 10 days : t = – 2 . 91 , P = 0 . 0094 , n = 44 nestlings from 22 broods ) . This interaction was , however , not present at hatch - ing ( LMM : playback by future nest temperature : t = – 1 . 03 , P = 0 . 31 ; playback alone : t = – 0 . 13 , P = 0 . 89 , n = 130 nestlings from 45 broods ) and was not due to differential nestling mortality ( Cox proportional hazard regression : playback by nest temperature : Z = 0 . 25 , P = 0 . 80 , n = 166 nestlings in 52 broods ; nest temperature in treatment : Z = – 0 . 43 , P = 0 . 67 , n = 79 nestlings in 35 broods ; nest temperature in control : Z = – 0 . 38 , P = 0 . 70 , n = 87 nestlings in 37 broods ) . In birds , maternal effects on nestling growth induced by differential hormone concentra - tions in the egg are partly mediated posthatch - ing by their effects on nestling begging ( 19 , 20 ) . Therefore , and because incubation calling al - tered nestling begging in fairy wrens ( 10 , 11 ) , we investigated whether differences in nestling begging could underlie the differential growth patterns followed by experimental nestlings in response to nest temperatures ( 24 ) . According - ly , in the first 3 days after hatching , treatment nestlings ( i . e . , incubation call playback ) were more likely to call while begging when they had experienced high temperatures in the nest since hatching , whereas control nestlings called less , independently of temperature ( Fig . 3 ) ( gener - alized LMM : playback by temperature in nest : Z = 2 . 23 , P = 0 . 026 , n = 77 recordings for 59 chicks from 19 broods ) . Nestling mass and satiation at the time of recording had no effect on the probability of calling while begging ( mass : Z = – 0 . 71 , P = 0 . 48 ; presence of seeds in crop : Z = 0 . 86 , P = 0 . 39 ) , which suggests that this call might signal thermal state ( 12 , 15 ) rather than hunger level or body condition . The decrease in mass with increasing nest temperatures that we found in treatment nest - lings ( compared with control nestlings ) ( Fig . 2 ) is consistent with the current pattern observed in many wild bird species worldwide ( 26 ) . Al - though this environmentally driven size reduc - tion is generally expected to have negative effects on offspring fitness [ e . g . , ( 27 , 28 ) ] , reducing mass gain at high temperature might be beneficial if it reduces oxidative damage associated with growth in such an environment or if small body size facilitates heat loss ( 26 , 29 , 30 ) . Therefore , to determine whether such a pattern is adap - tive , we measured the reproductive success of our experimental birds at adulthood ( 24 ) . Re - sembling the pattern in treatment nestlings , females that as nestlings had low body mass under hot conditions during development or greater body mass in cold rearing conditions produced more fledglings in their first breed - ing season ( Fig . 4A ) [ generalized linear model ( GLM ) : Z = – 2 . 66 , P = 0 . 0078 , n = 39 females ] . This effect applied to both treatment and control SCIENCE sciencemag . org 19 AUGUST 2016 (cid:127) VOL 353 ISSUE 6301 813 Fig . 2 .

RESEARCH | REPORTS females ( no additional effect of playback treat - ment : Z = 0 . 39 , P = 0 . 69 ) after controlling for female mass as adult ( Z = 2 . 83 , P = 0 . 005 ) . Furthermore , this fitness effect of early mass and thermal conditions persisted in females ’ second year of life despite repairing ( GLM : Z = – 2 . 31 , P = 0 . 021 ; repairing : Z = 1 . 17 , P = 0 . 24 ; adult mass : Z = 2 . 82 , P = 0 . 005 , n = 36 females , including 25 with a new partner ) . Males fol - lowed a similar trend to females in their first year [ GLM with temperature in nest ( i . e . , am - bient temperature + nest differential ) : Z = – 1 . 97 , P = 0 . 049 , n = 36 males ] but not their second year ( GLM : Z = 1 . 65 , P = 0 . 10 , n = 38 males ) . Last , the evolutionary advantage of maternal effects has been questioned in unpredictable environments , where environmental conditions during development do not predict those en - countered later in life ( 31 ) . However , individuals may partly compensate for this by seeking microhabitats that best suit their phenotype . Accordingly , treatment individuals exposed to incubation calls in the egg went on to consist - ently breed in hotter nest boxes than control birds , because control males used cooler boxes and treatment males used warmer boxes than expected by chance in the first and second years , respectively ( Fig . 4B ) ( Monte - Carlo sim - ulations : first - year control males : P = 0 . 024 , n = 22 , and females : P = 0 . 075 , n = 15 ; second - year treatment males : P = 0 . 046 , n = 10 ; all others : P > 0 . 05 ) ( 24 ) . Overall , we have demonstrated experimen - tally that by acoustically signaling high ambient temperatures to their embryos before hatch - ing , zebra finch parents can program the de - velopmental trajectories of their offspring in response to this key environmental variable . Our findings therefore provide both an adapt - ive function for prenatal communication and a type of maternal effect where parental con - trol over signal production can be unambigu - ously tested . By uncovering a mechanism for a transgenerational effect of temperature on development in endotherms , our study also ad - vances our understanding of the acclimatization capacities of organisms to rising temperatures .

Briggs 1 ‡ Coexpression networks and gene regulatory networks ( GRNs ) are emerging as important tools for predicting functional roles of individual genes at a system - wide scale . To enable network reconstructions , we built a large - scale gene expression atlas composed of 62 , 547 messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) , 17 , 862 nonmodified proteins , and 6227 phosphoproteins harboring 31 , 595 phosphorylation sites quantified across maize development . Networks in which nodes are genes connected on the basis of highly correlated expression patterns of mRNAs were very different from networks that were based on coexpression of proteins . Roughly 85 % of highly interconnected hubs were not conserved in expression between RNA and protein networks . However , networks from either data type were enriched in similar ontological categories and were effective in predicting known regulatory relationships . Integration of mRNA , protein , and phosphoprotein data sets greatly improved the predictive power of GRNs . P redicting the functional roles of individ - ual genes at a system - wide scale is a com - plex challenge in biology . Transcriptome data have been used to generate genome - wide gene regulatory networks ( GRNs ) ( 1 – 4 ) and coexpression networks ( 5 – 7 ) , the design of which was based on the presumption that mRNA measurements are a proxy for protein abundance measurements . However , genome - wide correlations between the levels of proteins and mRNAs are weakly positive ( 8 – 15 ) , which indicates that cellular networks built solely on transcriptome data may be enhanced by 814 19 AUGUST 2016 (cid:127) VOL 353 ISSUE 6301 sciencemag . org SCIENCE 1 Division of Biological Sciences , University of California San Diego , La Jolla , CA 92093 , USA . 2 Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology , Iowa State University , Ames , IA 50011 , USA . 3 Plant Biology Laboratory , The Salk Institute for Biological Studies , La Jolla , CA 92037 , USA . 4 Genomic Analysis Laboratory , The Salk Institute for Biological Studies , La Jolla , CA 92037 , USA . 5 Department of Agronomy and Horticulture , University of Nebraska , Lincoln , NE 68583 , USA . 6 Howard Hughes Medical Institute , The Salk Institute for Biological Studies , 10010 North Torrey Pines Road , La Jolla , CA 92037 , USA . * These authors contributed equally to this work . † Present address : Department of Genetics , Davison Life Sciences , 120 East Green Street , Athens , GA 30602 , USA . ‡ Corresponding author .
