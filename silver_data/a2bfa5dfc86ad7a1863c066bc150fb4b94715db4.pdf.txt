Here we reveal a novel approach for regulating lifespan . Using a genetic or a pharmacological strategy to lower the rate of sphingolipid synthesis , we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells live longer . The longer lifespan is due in part to a reduction in Sch9 protein kinase activity and a consequent reduction in chromosomal mutations and rearrangements and increased stress resistance . Longer lifespan also arises in ways that are independent of Sch9 or caloric restriction , and we speculate on ways that sphingolipids might mediate these aspects of increased lifespan . Sch9 and its mammalian homolog S6 kinase work downstream of the target of rapamycin , TOR1 , protein kinase , and play evolutionarily conserved roles in regulating lifespan . Our data establish Sch9 as a focal point for regulating lifespan by integrating nutrient signals from TOR1 with growth and stress signals from sphingolipids . Sphingolipids are found in all eukaryotes and our results suggest that pharmacological down - regulation of one or more sphingolipids may provide a means to reduce age - related diseases and increase lifespan in other eukaryotes .

Except for caloric restriction ( CR ) , there has been little prospect for increasing lifespan . But recent studies offer hope for developing drugs that increase lifespan by reducing the incidence of age - related diseases that kill most humans . The immunosuppressant drug rapamycin has been shown to reduce age - related diseases and increase lifespan in yeasts , flies and mice [ 1 – 3 ] and these results have stimulated searches for new ways to enhance lifespan [ 4 – 6 ] . Here we introduce a novel strategy to extend the lifespan of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells that involves reducing the rate of sphingolipid synthesis . This strategy increases lifespan at least partly by reducing the activity of the Sch9 protein kinase , a homolog of mammalian ribosomal S6 kinase , both of which regulate lifespan and function downstream of the target of rapamycin ( TOR ) protein kinase , a well established and evolutionarily conserved regulator of lifespan [ 7 – 10 ] . Sphingolipids are recognized as structural components of eukaryotic membranes and as signaling molecules for regulating cell growth and migration , differentiation , apoptosis , senescence and inflammation [ 11 – 13 ] . This wide range of functions arises from the variation in carbon chain length , degree and location of unsaturation and hydroxylation along with other modifications of the long - chain bases ( LCBs ) and fatty acids that are amide - linked to each other to form ceramides , to which polar groups are attached to form complex sphingolipids [ 14 ] . Variation in polar head groups further expands the types of sphingolipids found in nature and implies that many more functions await discovery . Although yeast sphingolipids ( Figure S1 in Text S1 ) lack the complexity of those in mammals , S . cerevisiae has , nevertheless , been vital in identifying sphingolipid metabolic genes and in understanding sphingolipid functions [ 15 – 17 ] . Studies in yeast , worms , flies and mice establish the TOR pathway as a vital regulator of aging and lifespan [ 1 , 2 , 8 , 10 , 18 , 19 ] . Eukaryotes have two types of TOR complexes and TOR complex 1 ( TORC1 ) regulates lifespan . Yeast TORC1 phosphorylates serine and threonine residues in the C - terminus of Sch9 ( Figure 1A ) [ 20 ] while an additional residue , T570 , in the activation loop of the kinase domain must be phosphorylated also for Sch9 to be active [ 20 , 21 ] . Residue T570 is phosphorylated by the redundant Pkh1 and Pkh2 protein kinases , homologs of mammalian phosphoinosi - tide - dependent protein kinase 1 ( PDK1 ) [ 20 – 22 ] . Dual regulation of Sch9 provides a way to monitor environmen - tal and cellular cues and integrate them with multiple biological processes necessary for growth and survival . TORC1 senses and is activated by nutrients , particularly amino acids , and growth factors to promote biosynthetic processes such as protein synthesis [ 10 , 23 ] . In contrast , nutrient depletion or environmental stresses reduce TORC1 activity and biosynthetic processes become less active while catabolic processes , such as autophagy , become more active in order to salvage nutrients and reduce their consumption . Pkh1 / 2 are also involved in nutrient and stress signaling and activate not only Sch9 ( Figure 1A ) , but also the Ypk1 and Ypk2 protein kinases ( homologs of mammalian serum and glucocorticoid - inducible kinase , SGK ) , Pkc1 and PKA thereby controlling many cellular processes PLoS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 1 February 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e1002493 including endocytosis , cell wall integrity , growth , actin dynamics and stress resistance [ 15 , 16 , 24 , 25 ] . Sphingolipids are known activators of Pkh1 / 2 [ 15 , 16 , 26 , 27 ] and we posit that they ought to regulate lifespan by controlling the activity of the Pkh1 / 2 - Sch9 pathway . By lowering the rate of sphingolipid biosynthesis , we demonstrate enhancement of chronological lifespan ( CLS ) , a measure of how long non - dividing cells survive in stationary phase . The increase in lifespan is due to Sch9 - dependent and independent processes that are also con - trolled by sphingolipids . Results Genetic strategy for down - regulating sphingolipid synthesis In one strategy to determine if sphingolipids regulate CLS we used a tetracycline - repressible promoter cassette ( tetO7 ) to regulate gene transcription [ 28 ] . The utility of this strategy for studying CLS was verified by using cells having transcription of the SCH9 gene ( tetO7 - SCH9 ) or the RIM15 gene ( tetO7 - RIM15 ) controlled by the tetO7 promoter . Based on the roles of Sch9 and Rim15 in lifespan [ 7 ] , we expected CLS to increase in doxycycline ( Dox ) - treated tetO7 - SCH9 cells and to decrease in Dox - treated tetO7 - RIM15 cells . We find that a low concentration of Dox ( 100 ng / ml ) significantly increases the CLS of tetO7 - SCH9 cells ( Figure 1B ) while a higher dose of Dox ( 1000 ng / ml ) is needed to decrease the CLS of tetO7 - RIM15 cells ( Figure 1C ) . In control experiments we find that Dox treatment has no effect on the CLS of the parental strain R1158 ( Figure 1B and 1C , WT ) . Thus , this experimental strategy is able to recapitulate the CLS phenotype of sch9 D and rim15 D mutant cells . It also recapitulates the increased oxidative stress resistance of sch9 D cells and the reduced resistance of rim15 D cells [ 7 ] ( Figure 1D ) . Down - regulating tetO7 - LCB1 and tetO7 - LCB2 increases CLS The essential LCB1 and LCB2 genes encode subunits of serine palmitoyltransferase ( SPT ) , the first and rate - limiting enzyme in sphingolipid biosynthesis ( Figure S1 in Text S1 ) [ 15 ] and we expected that by lowering expression of LCB1 or LCB2 it should be possible to lower the level of sphingolipids and extend lifespan via reduction of the sphingolipid - controlled Pkh1 / 2 - Sch9 path - way . We identified concentrations of Dox that reduce the initial rate of growth but not the final cell density of strains with tetO7 - LCB1 or tetO7 - LCB2 alleles , consistent with a lowered rate of sphingolipid synthesis but not low enough to affect the final cell density or mass yield ( Figure 2A and 2B ) . Under these conditions Dox - treated and untreated cells should be in a similar metabolic state upon entering stationary phase and any effect of Dox on lifespan should be due to down - regulation of LCB1 or LCB2 rather than to off target effects . We find that the CLS of tetO7 - LCB1 or tetO7 - LCB2 cells treated with 100 or 300 ng / ml of Dox increases significantly ( Figure 2C and 2D ) . Control experiments demonstrate that this increase in CLS is due to down - regulation of LCB1 or LCB2 and not to off target effects of Dox . First , Dox treatment has no effect on the CLS of wild - type R1158 cells , the parent of tetO7 - LCB1 and tetO7 - LCB2 cells ( Figure 1B and 1C ) . Next , we reasoned that introduction of a plasmid - borne wild - type LCB1 gene into tetO7 - LCB1 cells should preclude Dox from increasing CLS , since the wild - type LCB1 allele will not respond to Dox and SPT activity should be normal . As expected , the CLS of Dox - treated tetO7 - LCB1 cells transformed with a single - copy vector carrying the LCB1 gene is reduced compared to cells transformed with just the vector and is similar to cells not treated with Dox ( Figure 2E ) . Analogous experiments with tetO7 - LCB2 cells give similar results ( Figure 2F ) . We conclude from these data that Dox treatment of cells carrying a tetO7 - LCB1 or tetO7 - LCB2 allele increases CLS because expression of the LCB1 or LCB2 gene is reduced . Finally , most experimental manipulations enhance lifespan in part by increasing stress resistance . Thus we anticipated that down - regulating the tetO7 - LCB1 or tetO7 - LCB2 genes by Dox treatment would increase stress resistance and , indeed , resistance to heat and hydrogen peroxide stress did increase ( Figure 2G ) . Myriocin treatment increases CLS A second strategy for determining if sphingolipids regulate CLS uses myriocin , an inhibitor of SPT , to down - regulate enzyme activity . We examined the effect of low doses of myriocin on three strains : DBY746 , used extensively to study CLS [ 7 ] , BY4741 , the parent of one of the non - essential yeast gene deletion sets which is often used to study lifespan [ 8 ] , and a derivative of BY4741 , R1158 , the parent strain for making tetO7 - regulated genes [ 28 ] . The initial rate of R1158 cell growth is the least impaired by myriocin treatment while growth of DBY746 and BY4741 cells is more impaired ( Figure 3A , 3C and 3E ) . The highest concentration of myriocin used for each strain causes a delay in initial cell growth and increases the time it takes for DBY746 and BY4741 cells to enter stationary phase . However , the final cell density is either the same as or within 20 % of the cell density found in the absence of drug , which argues that differences in final cell density or failure to enter stationary phase are not likely to explain the effect of myriocin on CLS . Using these same drug concentrations , there is a robust , dose - dependent and statistically significant increase in the CLS of each strain ( Figure 3B , 3D and 3F ) with DBY746 cells showing the largest increase ( Figure 3B ) . DBY746 cells treated with 400 ng / ml of myriocin grow slowly and , unlike the other cells , do not stop growing at 72 hrs ( CLS day 1 ) , but keep growing up to about the 120 hr time point . This causes an increase in viable cells on CLS days 3 and 6 ( Figure 3B , solid red line ) and overstates the increase in CLS . To compensate for this extended growth phase , we set the 120 hr time point as CLS day 1 Author Summary Studies with rats in the 1930s showed a surprising increase in lifespan when the diet contained 30 % – 40 % fewer calories than normal . This experiment has been repeated on many organisms and is the gold standard for extending lifespan . While we are beginning to understand how calorie restriction regulates lifespan , the mechanisms are complex and much remains to be learned . In the work presented here , we demonstrate a novel way to increase lifespan in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Our strategy is to lower the rate of sphingolipid synthesis either by reducing the synthesis of the first enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway or by using a drug to reduce enzyme activity . This strategy works in part by lowering the activity of a protein kinase , termed Sch9 in yeast and S6K in mammals , both of which are involved in the processes affected by calorie restriction and that control lifespan . In addition , we find that reducing sphingolipid synthesis increases lifespan in ways that are independent of Sch9 and calorie restriction . Since sphingolipids are found in all eukaryotes , our results suggest that pharmacological down - regulation of one or more sphingolipids may provide a means to reduce age - related diseases and increase lifespan in other eukaryotes . Sphingolipids Control Lifespan PLoS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 2 February 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e1002493 ( compared to the 72 hr time point for the other cultures ) . This corrected survival curve still shows an increase in lifespan ( Figure 3B , dashed red line ) , but not as large an increase as the uncorrected curve ( Figure 3B , solid red line ) . Myriocin treatment , similar to down - regulation of LCB1 or LCB2 expression , increases resistance of DBY746 cells to both heat and hydrogen peroxide stress ( Figure 3G ) . In summary , the data presented in Figure 3 provide additional and independent support for the hypothesis that sphingolipids regulate stress resistance and CLS . Wild - type yeast cells normally grow to a specific size , but mutation of SCH9 has the unusual effect of reducing cell size [ 29 ] . If a reduction in sphingolipid synthesis increases CLS by reducing Sch9 activity as we predict ( Figure 1A ) , then cell size ought to be reduced . We find that the volume of myriocin - treated DBY746 cells on CLS day 1 is 28 % lower than that of untreated cells ( Figure S2 in Text S1 , 59 verses 82 m m 3 ) . This reduction is less than the 40 % reduction reported for sch9 D cells compared to wild - type DBY746 cells [ 30 ] , but probably reflects just a partial reduction of Sch9 activity in myriocin - treated cells ( see below ) compared to no activity in sch9 D cells . Acetic acid accumulation in the diauxic shift has been proposed as a major cause of cell death , but it can be alleviated by buffering the medium [ 31 ] . To eliminate the possibility that myriocin treatment extends CLS by preventing acetic acid killing , we compared the effect of myriocin treatment in buffered and unbuffered medium . Medium was buffered with succinate ( 200 mM ) , pH 4 . 5 , because this compound is not metabolized by yeast cells . Myriocin treatment extended CLS in either buffered or unbuffered media ( Figure 3H ) . Thus , myriocin treatment does not extend lifespan simply by increasing resistance to acetic acid and additional support for this conclusion is provided below . Also , we found that the rate of cell death increased because the concentration of iron ( 1 . 23 m M ) in SDC medium was limiting and we added 3 - fold more iron to the medium ( indicated in figure legends ) to eliminate this variable . The succinate - buffered medium Figure 1 . The tetO7 promoter can be used to regulate CLS . ( A ) Model showing how sphingolipids are proposed to regulate lifespan . In this model LCBs and perhaps other sphingolipids activate the Pkh1 and Pkh2 protein kinases which phosphorylate residue T570 in the activation loop of the Sch9 protein kinase . Activation of Sch9 also requires phosphorylation of C - terminal residues by the TORC1 kinase . Ceramide - mediated activation of the Sit4 protein phosphatase may also play roles in regulating lifespan as outlined in the Discussion .

The low pH of this medium is advantageous because the solubility of iron increases greatly at lower pHs [ 33 ] . Down - regulating LCB1 or SPT lowers sphingolipid levels If sphingolipids mediate increased CLS , then we predict that down - regulating tetO7 - LCB1 expression by Dox treatment or reducing SPT activity by myriocin treatment should lower sphingolipid levels . We measured LCBs , made primarily as intermediates in the de novo sphingolipid synthesis pathway , as well as the terminal complex sphingolipids found primarily in the plasma membrane . We also measured LCBPs made by phosphorylation of LCBs and thought to primarily represent intermediates in the degradation of LCBs ( Figure S1 in Text S1 ) . We find that Dox treatment of tetO7 - LCB1 cells , grown the same way as in a CLS assay , reduces total LCBs ( C16 - , C18 - and C20 - dihydrosphingosine and C18 - and C20 - phytosphingosine ) by 84 % with individual species of LCBs responding uniquely to drug treatment ( Figure 4A ) . The much less abundant LCBPs are also reduced in toto by about 70 % ( Figure 4A ) . Dox treatment of wild - type R1158 cells does not produce a statistically significant change in the level of LCBs and LCBPs ( data not shown ) . Similarly , myriocin treatment of DBY746 cells , grown in the same way as in a CLS assay , reduces total LCBs by 64 % and total LCBPs 62 % ( Figure 4B ) . Next , we examined the effect of down - regulating sphingolipid synthesis on complex sphingolipids including inositol - phosphocer - amide ( IPC ) , mannose - inositol - phosphoceramide ( MIPC ) and mannose - ( inositol - P ) 2 - ceramide ( M ( IP ) 2 C ) ( Figure S1 in Text S1 ) . There is a statistically significant reduction in IPCs in both Dox treated tetO7 - LCB1 cells and myriocin - treated DBY746 cells ( Figure 4C , 4D and 4E ) . Because MIPCs are not well separated from IPCs ( Figure 4C ) , both types of sphingolipids , not just IPCs , may be reduced in drug - treated cells . There is a tendency for M ( IP ) 2 Cs to decrease in Dox - treated tetO7 - LCB1 cells but to increase in myriocin - treated DBY746 cells . However , neither change is statistically significant , suggesting that M ( IP ) 2 Cs are not playing roles in CLS . Our data show that down - regulating the rate of sphingolipid synthesis by impairing activity of the first enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway lowers the concentration of LCBs , LCBPs , IPCs and perhaps MIPCs and some or all of these changes could influence CLS . Pkh2 regulates CLS As further support for our hypothesis that sphingolipids regulate CLS by controlling the Pkh1 / 2 - Sch9 signaling pathway , we sought to show that PKH1 or PKH2 or both genes regulate CLS . Recently , deletion of PKH2 in the diploid BY4743 strain background was shown to produce a small but significant increase in CLS [ 34 ] . To verify these data and extend them to a haploid strain background and culture conditions with a different pH and buffering ions , we measured the CLS of a pkh2 D mutant made in the R1158 strain background . We find a small but statistically significant increase in the CLS of pkh2 D cells ( Figure 5A ) . Our data are very similar to results obtained with BY4743 cells where the mean survival interval ( area under a survival curve ) was 3 . 10 for wild - type cells compared to 4 . 05 ( 34 % increase ) for pkh2 D cells whereas our values are 4 . 14 verses 5 . 23 ( 29 % increase ) . Together , the published data and our data establish a role for Pkh2 in regulating CLS . Phosphorylation of residue T570 in Sch9 is critical for protein kinase activity and is mediated in vivo and in vitro by Pkh1 / 2 [ 20 , 25 ] and is stimulated by LCBs [ 21 ] . If Pkh1 / 2 regulate Sch9 activity by phosphorylating residue T570 , we anticipate less phosphorylation in pkh2 D cells , since this would reflect reduced Sch9 activity and would explain the increase in CLS of pkh2 D cells . We find a statistically significant 20 % reduction of T570 phosphorylation in pkh2 D cells compared to wild - type PKH2 cells which supports the hypothesis that Pkh2 phosphorylates this key Sch9 residue ( Figure 5B and 5C ) . Another prediction of the proposed signaling pathway going from sphingolipids to Pkh1 / 2 to Sch9 and other downstream kinases ( Figure 1A ) is that growth of cells with a low level of Pkh kinase activity ought to be more sensitive to myriocin ( reduced SPT activity ) compared to cells with a higher level of kinase activity if sphingolipids regulate Pkh activity . Comparison of the myriocin sensitivity of cells with varying combinations of mutant and wild - type PKH1 and PKH2 alleles shows that cells with a temperature - sensitive PKH1 allele or a deletion allele are very sensitive to myriocin at a permissive temperature compared to cells with PKH1 or PKH2 or both wild - type genes ( Figure 5D ) . Likewise , deletion of either gene in a tetO7 - LCB1 strain reduces Pkh activity and increases sensitivity to myriocin ( Figure S4A in Text S1 ) , moreover , Dox treatment further reduces Pkh activity by lowering sphingolipid levels and impairs growth compared to the parent tetO7 - LCB1 ( PKH1 PKH2 ) strain ( Figure S4B in Text S1 ) . These data all support the proposed role of sphingolipids as upstream activators of the Pkh1 / 2 kinases . Sphingolipids control phosphorylation of Sch9 - T570 and Sch9 substrates To explore further the hypothesized role of sphingolipids in regulating CLS via the Pkh1 / 2 - Sch9 signaling pathway , we examined phosphorylation of Sch9 residue T570 . If sphingolipids control T570 phosphorylation , then reducing SPT activity by myriocin treatment or by Dox treatment of tetO7 - LCB1 cells should decrease phosphorylation . Cells were grown as in a CLS assay , but because drug - treated cells grow slower than untreated cells , comparisons were made with cells grown to similar A 600 nm values ( , 1 ) rather than for similar times . We find a statistically significant 35 % reduction in T570 phosphorylation in log phase DBY746 cells treated for 7 – 8 cell doublings with myriocin compared to untreated cells ( Figure 5E and 5F , n = 4 cultures ) . Also , in parental R1158 ( LCB1 ) and tetO7 - LCB1 cells myriocin treatment reduces T570 phosphorylation by 40 % ( Figure 5G , compare lane 1 with 2 and lane 3 with 4 ) . Lastly , there is a 40 % reduction in T570 phosphorylation in Dox - treated tetO7 - LCB1 cells ( Figure 5H , compare lanes 3 and 4 ) but no effect in parental R1158 cells , as expected since LCB1 is not regulated by the tetO7 promoter ( Figure 5H , compare lanes 1 and 2 ) .

In all cases examined ( Figure 5E , 5G and 5H ) , the total level of Sch9 protein is not changed by drug treatment . However , drug treatment does cause a shift of the Sch9 band to a slightly faster migrating form , similar to what is seen when phosphorylation of Sch9 is reduced [ 20 ] . In the case where Pkh activity was reduced by deleting PKH2 rather than by down - regulating sphingolipid synthesis , there was no shift in the mobility of Sch9 to a faster migrating form even though phosphorylation of T570 decreased ( Figure 5B ) . Thus , the band shift we observe suggests that a reduction in sphingolipids triggers dephosphorylation of other Sch9 amino acid residues in addition to T570 and further work will be required to identify the residues involved . The effect of myriocin treatment on the phosphorylation level of the Sch9 substrate Dot6 was also examined . Sch9 regulates ribosome biogenesis in part by phosphorylating transcriptional repressor proteins including Dot6 , Tod6 and Stb3 [ 35 , 36 ] . Dot6 controls transcription of ribosome biogenesis [ 37 ] genes that are essential for ribosome formation . We find that Dot6 - 5HA in myriocin - treated cells migrates faster on a denaturing gel than it does in untreated cells ( Figure 5I ) , indicating reduced phosphor - ylation by Sch9 [ 36 ] . To directly demonstrate reduced Sch9 activity in these myriocin - treated cells , the blot shown in Figure 5I was reprobed for T570 phosphorylation . As found in other myriocin - treated cells , there was a reduction in T570 phosphor - ylation and an increase in Sch9 mobility , both indicative of reduced Sch9 activity ( Figure 5J ) . Together , the data shown in Figure 5 demonstrate that down - regulating sphingolipid synthesis by treatment of cells with myriocin or Dox reduces Sch9 activity . Reduced activity is at least partly responsible for the increase in CLS we observe in drug - treated cells ( Figure 2 , Figure 3 , and Figure 7 ) . Down - regulating sphingolipid synthesis enhances CLS by Sch9 - dependent and - independent mechanisms Part of the mechanism for increased CLS in sch9 D cells is greater resistance to oxidative , heat and acetic acid stress [ 7 , 31 ] . If sphingolipids are regulating CLS by Sch9 - dependent mechanisms , then reducing the rate of sphingolipid synthesis should increase stress resistance . Indeed , resistance to heat and oxidative stress do increase ( Figure 2G and Figure 3G ) as does resistance to acetic acid when tetO7 - LCB1 cells are treated with Dox , and resistance is nearly as robust as in sch9 D cells ( Figure 6A ) . Likewise , treating DBY746 cells with myriocin increases resistance to acetic acid albeit resistance is not enhanced as much as in sch9 D cells ( Figure 6B ) . These data support the hypothesis that sphingolipids regulate CLS by Sch9 - dependent mechanisms . Deletion of SCH9 is known to extend CLS by enhancing respiration [ 38 , 39 ] . To determine if myriocin treatment also extends CLS by inducing respiration we measured oxygen consumption . We find a more than 2 - fold , statistically significant increase in oxygen consumption in myriocin - treated cells com - pared to untreated cells ( Figure 6C ) . In contrast , there is no statistically significant stimulation of oxygen consumption in sch9 D cells treated with myriocin , indicating that Sch9 mediates most if not all of the effect of myriocin on oxygen consumption ( Figure 6C ) . Sch9 also affects aging and lifespan by controlling genome stability [ 40 , 41 ] . For example , sgs1 D cells display premature age - dependent genome instability that is prevented by deletion of SCH9 [ 42 ] . Sgs1 is a member of the RecQ helicase family of DNA unwinding proteins which maintain genome stability . Sgs1 is related to human RecQ helicases WRN , defective in the premature aging disorder Werner’s syndrome , and BLM , defective in the cancer - prone disorder Blooms’ syndrome [ 42 ] . If sphingo - lipids control Sch9 activity , then age - dependent genome instability in a sgs1 D strain should be prevented by treating cells with myriocin . Genome instability was quantified by measuring the frequency of Can r mutations . As in previous studies [ 42 ] , we find Can r mutations accumulating at a faster rate in sgs1 D cells during chronological aging and by day 12 they are 4 - fold more abundant than in wild - type cells ( Figure 6D ) . Deletion of SCH9 reverses the effect of the sgs1 mutation since cultures of sgs1 D sch9 D cells have fewer Can r mutants than the wild - type cultures . Notably , treating sgs1 D cells with myriocin reduces the frequency of Can r mutants to the wild - type level at all times during a CLS assay ( Figure 6D ) . In a second assay of genome instability the frequency of gross chromosomal rearrangements ( GCRs ) was measured [ 42 ] . By day 12 there are five times more GCRs in sgs1 D cells than in wild - type or sgs1 D sch9 D cells ( Figure 6E ) . Again , myriocin treatment reduces the frequency of GCRs about 75 % at day 12 in sgs1 D cells , very similar to the reduction obtained by deleting SCH9 ( sgs1 D sch9 D cells , Figure 6E ) . In summary , the data presented in Figure 6 support the hypothesis that sphingolipids regulate CLS by Sch9 - dependent mechanisms . Finally , if myriocin enhances CLS entirely by mechanisms requiring Sch9 , then myriocin should not enhance CLS in sch9 D cells . We find that a dose of 25 or 100 ng / ml myriocin has no effect on the CLS of sch9 D cells , but a higher dose of 300 ng / ml produces a statistically significant increase in CLS starting around day 22 ( Figure 7A ) . Thus , myriocin most likely extends CLS in the early and middle time - frame of a CLS assay by Sch9 - dependent mechanisms , but at later times the enhancement in lifespan is independent of Sch9 . Possible mechanisms for the Sch9 - indepen - dent effects on CLS are presented in the Discussion . Down - regulating sphingolipid synthesis extends CLS in caloric - restricted cells Since calorie restriction increases the CLS of sch9 D cells [ 30 ] , we determined if myriocin produces an effect similar to CR . CR Figure 3 . Myriocin treatment extends CLS . ( A ) Growth rate of DBY746 cells + / 2 myriocin ( Myr ) treatment .

This extreme form of CR was used because it prevents adaptive regrowth and eliminates regrowth as an explanation for myriocin - induced CLS extension [ 40 ] . We find that myriocin produces a dose - dependent increase in the CLS of cells subjected to extreme CR ( Figure 7B ) . Thus , myriocin extends CLS in sch9 D cells similar to CR treatment , extends CLS even under conditions where adaptive regrowth does not occur , and programs cells for an extended lifespan prior to the end of the diauxic shift ( prior to shifting cells to water ) . In addition , these data further support the conclusion that myriocin does not simply extend CLS by protecting cells from acetic acid killing , since replacing the culture medium with water and changing the water every third day eliminates acetic acid accumulation . Finally , we find that myriocin also enhances CLS when CR is applied by reducing the concentration of glucose from 2 to 0 . 5 % ( Figure S3 in Text S1 ) . Discussion The desire for a long and healthy life is universal , but most of us will succumb sooner than hoped for due to age - related disorders , particularly cancer , cardiovascular disease and diabetes . Fortu - nately , strategies that enhance lifespan in model organisms work to a large degree by delaying the onset of these diseases . A striking example of this relationship is seen in monkeys during CR where the incidence of age - related diseases decreases while lifespan increases [ 43 , 44 ] . CR is not a practical strategy to extend lifespan in humans , but pharmacological agents are , and the rapamycin - type compounds seem quite promising [ 4 – 6 ] . As promising as rapamycin and related drugs are for improving human health and extending lifespan , they may have unforeseen drawbacks and be suitable only for individuals with specific genotypes . Hence , other strategies are needed . Sphingolipids regulate yeast lifespan Our data show that down - regulating sphingolipid synthesis produces an increase in the CLS of S . cerevisiae cells ( Figure 2 , Figure 3 , and Figure 7 ) and that part of this increase depends on the Sch9 protein kinase ( Figure S2 in Text S1 , Figure 5 , Figure 6 , and Figure 7A ) , an established regulator of lifespan . We show that CLS can be increased by lowering sphingolipid synthesis via manipulation of SPT , the initial enzyme in sphingolipid biosynthesis ( Figure 2 , Figure 3 , and Figure 7 ) . We propose that lowering SPT activity increases CLS , at least in part , by reducing the concentration of LCBs thereby lowering the activity of Pkh1 / 2 and Sch9 which programs cells for an extended lifespan ( Figure 1A ) . This scenario is supported by data showing that myriocin treatment or down - regulation of tetO7 - LCB1 gene expression diminishes Pkh1 / 2 - dependent phosphorylation of Sch9 residue T570 , essential for activity ( Figure 5 ) and reduces phosphorylation of the Sch9 substrate Dot6 ( Figure 5I ) . In addition , as a surrogate for Sch9 activity in vivo , we measured processes that play key roles in lifespan and are regulated by Sch9 . All processes including resistance to heat , oxidative and acetic acid stress ( Figure 2 , Figure 3 , Figure 6A and 6B ) , cell size ( Figure S2 in Text S1 ) , mitochondrial oxygen consumption ( Figure 6C ) , and genome stability ( Figure 6D and 6E ) responded to down - regulation of sphingolipid synthesis in a manner indicative of reduced Sch9 activity . Deletion of PKH2 was recently shown to extend CLS [ 34 ] . We verified this finding ( Figure 5A ) and show that phosphorylation of Sch9 T570 is reduced in pkh2 D cells ( Figure 5B ) . Finally , we show that cells with low Pkh kinase activity are much more sensitive to growth inhibition by myriocin or Dox than are cells with higher Pkh activity ( Figure 5D and Figure S4 in Text S1 ) . Together these data add further support for a signaling pathway comprised of sphingolipids R Pkh1 / 2 R Sch9 R CLS . While most of our data suggest that down - regulating sphingo - lipid synthesis increases lifespan by Sch9 - dependent mechanisms , the finding that myriocin causes a mobility shift in Sch9 , indicative of reduced phosphorylation , and increases the CLS of sch9 D cells argues for some aspects of CLS extension operating by Sch9 - independent mechanisms . Down - regulation of the protein kinase A [ 45 ] pathway is the most likely way for sphingolipids to affect lifespan independently of Sch9 , since these two pathways have been known to interact ever since the initial discovery of Sch9 [ 46 ] . Also , the pathways are known to interact in a way that extends CLS , since ras2 D sch9 D double mutant cells have a longer lifespan than the single mutants [ 30 ] . This interaction phenotype is similar to what we find with myriocin treatment of sch9 D cells ( Figure 7A ) . Recent publications have detected biochemical links between the Pkh1 / 2 - Sch9 and PKA pathways [ 24 , 25 , 47 ] and these may explain how myriocin increases the lifespan of sch9 D cells , but further effort is needed to determine if this is actually the case . In addition to LCBs , complex sphingolipids ( IPCs and perhaps MIPCs ) may be regulating CLS , since their concentration is lowered along with LCBs when SPT activity is down - regulated ( Figure 4C , 4D , and 4E ) . A multi - membrane spanning protein Nce102 has been proposed to sense complex sphingolipids and negatively regulate Pkh1 / 2 [ 26 ] . According to this proposal , a reduction in complex sphingolipids should increase Pkh1 / 2 activity by releasing Nce102 - mediated down - regulation . As a consequence , Sch9 activity should increase ; however , this would not enhance CLS and is contrary to our finding that reducing sphingolipids decreases Sch9 activity . Thus , Nce102 is unlikely to be mediating the increase in CLS that we observe . Figure 5 . Evidence for the sphingolipid R Pkh1 / 2 R Sch9 pathway .

These authors found that short - term , acute dose myriocin treatment of cells failed to reduce Pkh1 / 2 - mediated phosphorylation of residue T504 in the Ypk1 kinase . And recently , short - term , acute dose treatment of cells with myriocin did not decrease Pkh1 / 2 - mediated phosphorylation of T570 in Sch9 [ 25 ] . In contrast to these results , we show that lowering the rate of sphingolipid synthesis by long - term , low dose myriocin treatment or down - regulation of LCB1 expression reduces Pkh1 / 2 - mediated phosphorylation of T570 ( Figure 5 ) and , in addition , myriocin treatment reduces phosphorylation of the Sch9 substrate Dot6 ( Figure 5I ) . These results clearly support the idea that sphingolipids regulate lifespan by reducing Pkh1 / 2 - mediated phosphorylation of T570 thereby reducing Sch9 activity . Further work is required to determine which sphingolipids control Sch9 activity and CLS ( Figure 1A ) . Studies of the ISC1 gene also implicate sphingolipids in controlling lifespan . Isc1 hydrolyzes the polar head group from complex sphingolipids to yield ceramides . The CLS of isc1 D cells is reduced partly because of mitochondrial dysfunctions [ 48 ] , but CLS can be extended in these cells even beyond the wild - type value by deleting the SIT4 gene . Sit4 is the catalytic subunit of a PP2A - type protein phosphatase whose activity is down - regulated by TORC1 but up - regulated by ceramides ( Figure 1A ) . In our experiments , enhancement of CLS by down - regulating sphingo - lipid synthesis in both wild - type and sch9 D cells may involve Sit4 , because reducing the abundance of IPCs , and perhaps MIPCs ( Figure 4 ) , may lower the amount of ceramide generated by Isc1 . Figure 6 . Down - regulating sphingolipid synthesis enhances CLS by Sch9 - dependent mechanisms . ( A ) Doxycycline treatment enhances resistance of tetO7 - LCB1 ( RCD956 ) and tetO7 - SCH9 ( RCD952 ) cells to acetic acid . Cells from CLS day 1 , grown in the presence or absence of Dox ( 300 ng / ml , were treated with acetic acid . ( B ) Myriocin treatment enhances resistance of DBY746 ( WT ) cells to acetic acid . Cells were grown and treated with myriocin ( Myr ) as described in ( A ) . The sch9 D strain was PF102 . ( C ) The rate of oxygen consumption was measured in WT ( DBY746 ) or sch9 D ( PF102 ) cells treated on not treated with myriocin ( 400 ng / ml ) . Cells were grown as described in panel B of Figure 5 . Because cell volume is affected by myriocin treatment and deletion of SCH9 , we measured cell volumes and normalized the values to the volume of 10 6 WT cells grown without myriocin treatment . Average values for four cultures and statistical significance are indicated . ( D ) Myriocin treatment ( 300 ng / ml ) reduces the frequency of Can r mutations in sgs1 D cells .

Strains are : WT , RCD1009 ; sgs1 D , RCD1010 ; sgs1 D sch9 D , RCD1011 . ( E ) Myriocin treatment reduces the frequency of gross chromosomal rearrangements in sgs1 D cells . Strains , culture conditions are the same as described in ( D ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1002493 . g006 Sphingolipids Control Lifespan PLoS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 11 February 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e1002493 This should in turn lower Sit4 activity and increase CLS just like deletion of SIT4 ( Figure 1A ) . Finally , other studies implicate complex sphingolipids in CLS , since ipt1 D and skn1 D cells , which lack the most complex sphingolipid M ( IP ) 2 C , have a slight increase in CLS and deletion of both genes yields an additive increase in CLS [ 49 ] . It remains to be determined how a reduction in M ( IP ) 2 C increases CLS , but this effect is probably real as skn1 D cells ranked high in a survey of lifespan in the yeast single - deletion strain set [ 1 ] . Sphingolipids have been implicated also in RLS . The first S . cerevisiae gene found to regulate RLS , LAG1 ( Longevity - Assurance Gene 1 ) [ 50 ] , was later shown to encode a component of ceramide synthase which catalyzes ceramide synthesis from LCBs and fatty acids ( Figure S1 in Text S1 ) [ 51 , 52 ] . Deleting LAG1 increases RLS but has no effect on CLS [ 1 ] . Since the mechanism for increased RLS without increased CLS is unknown , it is difficult to relate these data to our CLS data . In cases where a decrease in LCBs has perturbed a cellular process in yeast it has been possible to restore the process by adding LCBs to the culture medium [ 53 – 55 ] . This strategy suggests that exogenous PHS should prevent the increase in CLS produced by Dox treatment of tetO7 - LCB1 cells . In actuality , low levels of PHS ( 10 – 500 nM ) did not thwart the increase in CLS and higher doses ( 10 m M ) actually enhanced CLS . Exogenous PHS is likely to enhance CLS by inducing the general stress response via activation of genes with stress response elements ( STREs ) in their promoter , as previously reported [ 53 , 56 ] . In addition , exogenous PHS is known to down - regulate amino acid and other nutrient transporters in yeast [ 57 , 58 ] and this is likely to increase lifespan since amino acid or glucose deprivation enhance yeast lifespan [ 1 , 59 ] . Lifespan regulation by myriocin and CR Because CR is the standard for judging interventions that extend lifespan , we determined if myriocin enhances lifespan in CR - treated cells . We found that myriocin treatment does enhance CLS in cells grown under moderate ( 0 . 5 % glucose , Figure S3 in Text S1 ) or extreme CR ( water ) conditions ( Figure 7B ) . These results are similar to the recent finding that rapamycin treatment increases the lifespan of caloric restricted Drosophila [ 3 ] and they have implications for human health . For example , it may be possible to reduce disease incidence and increase human lifespan by combining a drug with low level CR or with a CR mimetic such as rapamycin . Furthermore , a combination regime may reduce disease incidence in genotypic backgrounds which are unrespon - sive to single treatment regimes . Sphingolipids and lifespan in multicellular eukaryotes Increasing lifespan by using a pharmacological agent to down - regulate sphingolipid synthesis may be applicable to other organisms in addition to yeasts much as rapamycin treatment has been used to down - regulate the TOR pathway and increase lifespan in yeast , worms , flies and mice [ 1 – 3 , 10 , 18 ] . The sphingolipids that regulate lifespan in yeast may not be present in mammals and , thus , lifespan extension may require modulating another type of mammalian sphingolipid [ 11 ] . Ceramides and sphingosine - 1 - phosphate are the most widely appreciated sphin - golipid signaling molecules in mammals [ 11 , 12 ] . Ceramides are thought to promote age - related diseases since their concentration increases with age in many mammalian cells and tissues where they regulate processes that may control lifespan [ 60 – 64 ] . Recently long - chain hexosylceramides and lactosylceramides have been implicate in aging and lifespan in mice and cultured human cells [ 65 ] . The challenge will be to determine if mammalian lifespan can be extended by preventing the increase in ceramides or whether up or down - modulating the concentration of other sphingolipids will extend lifespan . There is , however , precedent for extending lifespan in multicellular eukaryotes through modulation of sphingolipids : inactivation of the Dacer gene , which encodes an Figure 7 .

As mutations and chromosomal rearrangements promote mammalian tumor cell formation , our demonstration that myriocin treatment reduces the rate of mutation and gross chromosomal rearrangements in yeast ( Figure 5D and 5E ) could lead to novel preventive measures and treatments for human cancers and thereby enhance lifespan . Materials and Methods Yeast strains , media , and plasmids Yeast strains used in our studies are listed in Table S1 in Text S1 . Viability assays were done by using YPD agar plates ( 2 % yeast extract , 1 % peptone , 2 % dextrose and 2 % agar ) . For CLS and stress resistance assays , cells were grown in SDC medium supplemented with a 4 - fold excess of the tryptophan , leucine , uracil and histidine to avoid possible artifacts due to auxotrophic deficiencies of the strain [ 30 ] . For initial experiments , SDC medium was lightly buffered to pH 6 . 0 ( 1 . 6 gm NaH 2 PO 4 N H 2 O / liter ) , while in later experiments it was more strongly buffered with succinic acid ( 200 mM , final pH 4 . 5 ) . Initially the concentration of iron in SDC medium was 1 . 23 m M ( 1 6 yeast nitrogen base ) but in later experiments the concentration was raised 3 - fold to avoid iron - starvation and reduced viability . In summary , SDC medium , pH 6 . 0 , 1 6 iron , was used for the experiments shown in Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Figure 3A – 3F , while the same medium , but with 3 6 iron , was used for the experiments shown in Figure 3H , Figure 4 , and Figure 6A . For the experiments shown in Figure 3G , 3H , Figure 5 , Figure 6C – 6E , Figure 7 , and Figures S2 , S3 , S4 in Text S1 the medium was SDC , pH 4 . 5 , 3 6 iron . The pRS315 and pRS316 vectors [ 67 ] were used to make pRS315ADE2 by ligating a 2 . 3 Kb PstI - SpeI fragment carrying ADE2 into the corresponding sites of pRS315 . Similarly , a genomic EcoRI - XhoI fragment was ligated to pRS316 cut with the same enzymes to make pRS316 - PKH1 and a genomic BamHI - SalI fragment was ligated to pRS316 cut with the same enzymes to make pRS316 - PKH2 . pLCB1 - 5 was made by ligating a 4 Kb NruI - SacI chromosomal fragment containing LCB1 and its promoter [ 68 ] to pRS315ADE2 digested with SacI and NaeI ( made blunt ended ) . pRS315 - LCB2 - B7 was made by ligating a 7 Kb BamHI chromosomal fragment containing LCB2 and its promoter [ 69 ] to pRS315 digested with BamHI . The plasmid encoding HA - tagged Dot6 has been described [ 36 ] . Lifespan assays CLS was measured as previously described [ 30 ] . Drug treatments were performed in medium containing a final concentration of 0 . 3 % ethanol ( ethanol plus drug ) . This was done be first adding a calculated volume of 95 % ethanol to the medium followed by diluting a stock solution of myriocin ( 200 m g / ml in 95 % ethanol , Sigma , # M1177 ) or doxycycline ( 100 m g / ml in 50 % ethanol , Sigma , # D9891 ) to yield the desired concentration of drug ( indicated in figure legends ) . Drugs were stored at 2 20 u C and warmed to room temperature before dilution into medium , followed by thorough mixing . Cells grown overnight at 30 u C in SDC medium were diluted into 25 ml of medium ( 125 ml flask ) to give an initial A 600 nm of 0 . 002 or as indicated in figure legends . Cultures were incubated at 30 u C in an air bath shaker ( 220 rpm ) for three days and cell viability was measured ( CLS day 1 ) by diluting and spreading cells on YPD plates . After 2 – 3 days of incubation at 30 u C colonies were counted and expressed a fraction of the day 1 value . Statistical significance was determined by using the two - tailed Student’s t - test . Stress resistance and oxygen consumption assays Cells grown in SDC medium for the time indicated in figure legends were diluted to an A 600 nm of 1 . 0 in K - phosphate buffer ( pH 6 . 0 ) , treated with hydrogen peroxide for 60 min at room temperature with mixing , serially diluted ( 10 - fold ) , spotted onto YPD plates , and incubated at 30 u C for 2 – 3 days . For thermal stress resistance , cells were serially diluted ( 10 - fold dilution starting with an A 600 nm = 1 ) , spotted onto YPD plates , and incubated at either 55 u C ( heat - shocked ) or 30 u C ( control ) for 45 – 180 min . Plates were incubated for 2 – 3 days at 30 u C . For acetic acid resistance , cells from day 1 ( 72 hrs of incubation ) of a CLS assay were treated with acetic acid as specified in the legend to Figure 6 for 2 hours at 30 u C , followed by dilution and plating on YPD plates to measure colony forming units ( CFUs ) . CFUs of the treated samples were expressed as a percentage of the untreated samples . Oxygen consumption was measured on cells grown from an A 600 nm of 0 . 005 to 1 at which time the cell concentration was quantified by counting cells in a Petroff - Hausser counting chamber , cell size was measured as described in Supplemental Information and oxygen consumption was measured by using an Oxytherm System [ 38 ] . Data are expressed as nmol of oxygen consumed per min per total volume of 10 6 DBY746 cells . Age - dependent DNA damage measurements The frequency of spontaneous canavanine - resistant mutants ( Can r ) mutants was measured by using a published assay [ 42 ] . Cells were grown as described for CLS experiments and assayed for CFUs except that cultures were started at a density of 0 . 05 A 600 nm units / ml and the SDC medium was buffered with succinate ( 200 mM , pH 4 . 5 ) and contained 3 . 69 m M iron ( 3 6 normal ) . These changes were necessary to prevent parental cells from dying so rapidly that they behaved like sgs1 mutant cells . Mutant sgs1 cells were grown in medium containing 300 ng / ml of myriocin . The frequency of Can r mutants was measured on the days indicated in Figure 6D . To identify Can r mutants , a sample of the culture was centrifuged and the cell pellet was washed once with sterile water and plated on selection medium ( SDC - ARG supplemented with 60 m g / ml L - canavanine sulfate ) s . After 3 – 4 days of incubation at 30 u C , the colonies were counted and expressed as the ratio to total viable cells . GCRs were assayed as described previously [ 42 ] . Strains carried a URA3 cassette at the HXT13 locus which is located 7 . 5 kb from the CAN1 gene towards the telomeric of chromosome V . The experimental protocol was similarly to the one for measuring Can r mutations but the frequency of simultaneous loss of CAN1 and URA3 was measured by plating cells on SDC plates containing 1 mg / ml 5 - fluoroorotic acid ( 5FOA ) and 60 m g / ml L - canavanine sulfate [ 70 ] . Analysis of LCBs , LCBPs , and complex sphingolipids To extract LCBs and LCBPs , cells were grown as described for CLS assays and at the indicated time points 10 A 600 nm units of cells were treated by slowly adding cold TCA to a final concentration of 6 % . After incubating on ice for 5 min , cells were collected by centrifugation , washed twice with cold water , and suspended in 500 m l of fresh 80 mM triethylamine ( made in HPLC grade absolute ethanol ) . Samples were sonicated in a water bath for 5 min at 37 u C , heated for 30 min at 65 u C , centrifuged and the supernatant fluid ( 150 m l ) was transferred to an HPLC sample vial insert . AQC ( 6 - aminoquinolyl - N - hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate ) reagent ( 30 m l ) was added and samples were treated at Sphingolipids Control Lifespan PLoS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 13 February 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e1002493 room temperature for 40 min followed by addition of 20 m l of 1 . 5 N KOH ( made in MeOH ) and incubation at 37 u C for 30 min . The pH was adjusted by adding 20 m l of 1 . 74 M acetic acid ( made in MeOH ) and 40 m l of the sample were assayed by HPLC [ 71 ] . Complex sphingolipids were analyzed as described previously [ 72 ] except for three changes . First , cells were grown in SDC medium ( pH 6 , 3 . 69 m M Fe ) from 0 . 005 to 1 A 600 nm units to produce uniform radiolabeling . Second , the concentration of [ 2 - 3 H ] myoinositol ( American Radiochemicals , Inc . , catalog # ART116 ) in the growth medium was 40 m Ci / ml . Finally , each lane on the thin - layer plate contained 20 m L of non - radioactive yeast sphingolipids ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) , which after charring , were used to verify the location of radioactive sphingolipids . Protein extraction and Western blotting analysis Cells were grown as described for a CLS assay and cell - free yeast extracts were prepared by using a modified published procedure [ 73 ] . Ten A 600 nm units of cells were treated with cold TCA as described above , suspended in 400 m l of water followed by the addition of 400 m l of 0 . 2 M NaOH . Thoroughly mixed samples were incubated 5 min at room temperature , concentrated by centrifugation and suspended in 200 m l of lysis buffer ( 0 . 06 M Tris - HCl , pH 6 . 8 , 5 % glycerol , 2 % SDS , 1 % b - mercaptoethanol ) . After heating at 95 u C for 5 min , samples were centrifuged and the protein concentration of the supernatant fluid was determined by using the DC protein assay kit ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . Samples ( 50 m g of protein ) electrophoresed on a 9 % SDS - PAGE gel were transferred for 1 . 5 hours onto a PVDF membrane ( Millipore Immobilon ) by using a Bio - Rad semi - dry transfer system . For the blots shown in Figure 5I and 5J the acrylamide - bisacrylamide ratio was changed from the normal 37 . 5 : 1 ratio to 172 : 1 . Membrane blocking and antibody binding were done in TBST ( 20 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 , pH 7 . 5 ) containing 5 % nonfat dry milk . Membranes were incubated for 2 hrs at room temperature with custom made polyclonal rabbit anti - Sch9 antibodies ( Batch 2872 , 1 : 1000 , OpenBiosystems ) , phosphor - specific anti - Sch9T570 antibodies ( 1 : 10 , 000 dilution ) [ 20 ] , anti - HA antibodies ( clone 3F10 , 1 : 5000 , Roche ) or commercial monoclonal mouse anti - Vma2 ( 1 : 3 , 000 dilution ) or anti - Vph1 ( 1 : 1000 dilution ) antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) . Other antibodies included alkaline phosphatase - linked anti - rabbit or anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 5000 , Sigma - Aldrich ) . Fluorescent signals from membranes exposed to an ECF substrate ( Amersham Biosciences ) were analyzed by using a PhosphorImager ( Amersham Biosciences ) and quantified by using ImageQuaNT Software .

Metabolic intermediates and complex sphingolipids are shown in bold font , genes are shown in italics and enzyme names are in regular lettering . Structures of compounds have been presented previously [ 74 , 75 ] . Figure S2 : Myriocin treatment decreases cell size . DBY746 cells were grown with and without myriocin ( Myr ) as in a CLS assay using SDC medium ( pH 4 . 5 , 3X iron ) . After 72 hrs of incubation , cells were stained directly with Calcofluor white M2R ( 25 m / ml ) and photographed at room temperature by using a Nikon Eclipse E600 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Plan Apo 100 6 1 . 40 oil immersion objective , a SPOT RT 9 . 0 Monochrome - 6 camera and SPOT basic software . For measurements , we excluded extremely large or small cells and cell diameter was calculated by measuring and averaging the long and short axes ( perpendicular to each other ) of each cell as described previously [ 30 ] . The median diameter for one hundred cells is indicated by a horizontal bar in the scatter plot . Figure S3 : CLS of WT ( DBY746 ) cells grown in SDC medium ( pH 4 . 5 , 3X iron ) with CR ( 0 . 5 % glucose ) or without CR ( NR , 2 % glucose ) + / 2 myriocin ( Myr ) treatment .
