None of the more recent additions to the set of journal indicators has focused specifically on interdisciplinarity ( Zitt , 2005 ) . Leydesdorff ( 2007 ) experimented with betweenness centrality as an indicator of interdisciplinarity in aggregated journal - journal citation networks . Stirling ( 2007 ; cf . Rao , 1982 ) proposed a diversity measure as part of “a general framework for analyzing diversity in science , technology and society” ( Rafols and Meyer , 2010 ) . The indicator integrates the ( in ) equality in a vector with the distance metrics of the network . In this study , we compare ( i ) this indicator with ( ii ) betweenness centrality as a network indicator , and ( iii ) the Gini and probabilistic entropy as vector - based indicators of specificity / diversity for the case of journals . Method The analysis is based on the aggregated citation matrix among the 8 , 207 journals contained in the JCRs of the Science and Social Science Citation Indices 2008 . This asymmetrical matrix is normalized using the cosine , both cited and citing . Euclidean distances were normalized as relative frequencies in order to prevent effects of differences in size causing spurious distances . Additionally , ( 1 – cosine ) can be used as a measure of dissimilarity . The three sets of indices— ( i ) Rao - Stirling diversity , ( ii ) matrix - based , and ( iii ) vector - based—are evaluated against one another . The structure of the set is explored using factor - analysis , and in relation to other journal indicators ( e . g . , the impact factor ) . Results On the citing side , one expects peripheral journals such as Chinese university journals to integrate different knowledge bases and thus to rank high on an indicator for “interdisciplinarity . ” On the cited side , a crucial question is how and to which extent an indicator corrects for the size effect of multidisciplinary journals such as Science and Nature . The results based on Euclidean distances versus ( 1 – cosine ) were not or negatively correlated : the diversity measure is highly sensitive to the choice of similarity criterion . The results using Euclidean distances were difficult to interpret ; the results based on ( 1 – cosine ) were size - dependent despite the normalization implied .

We added the Journal of Informetrics as a lower - ranked journal . With the exception of diversity measured on the basis of ( normalized ) Euclidean distances , all other indicators rank this journal between 48 and 51 on a list of 61 . The journal therefore is ranked as disciplinary , and is in this respect very different from JASIST or Scientometrics . Conclusion The factor analysis teaches us that betweenness centrality and Rao - Stirling diversity indicate different aspects of interdisciplinarity ( Wagner et al . , 2010 ) . The Gini coefficient does not qualify as an indicator of interdisciplinarity since the latter is not just the opposite of ( disciplinary ) specificity . Although sensitive to size , the journals top - ranked by the entropy measure are recognizable as intuitively the most interdisciplinary among the journals . An algorithm that would weigh the cosine values as a basis for the computation of betweenness centrality would perhaps improve our capacity to indicate interdisciplinarity ( Brandes , 2001 ) .
