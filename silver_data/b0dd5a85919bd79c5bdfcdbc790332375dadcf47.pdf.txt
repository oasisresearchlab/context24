Support Designer - Teacher Collaboration in Educational Game Design Using Learning Science Principles Qianou Ma qianoum @ andrew . cmu . edu Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , USA Erik Harpstead harpstead @ cmu . edu Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , USA ABSTRACT Educational game design requires interdisciplinary collaboration between game designers and teachers , and tools like learning sci - ence principles have been suggested to facilitate this process and help design better - integrated games . However , the translation from learning science theory to practice is not well studied , and no pre - vious study has examined how the presentation format of learning science principles may influence the effectiveness of a realistic , col - laborative game design process between designers and teachers . In this paper , we present the initial design of a study that will exam - ine how the forms and presentation of learning science principles might influence designer - teacher collaboration , which has both theoretical and practical implications in the fields of educational game design and learning science .

But the design of educational games is a complicated process that involves both game designers and pedagogical experts . Efficient communication among people from vastly different disciplines is crucial to the design process to create an engaging and educational game product [ 39 , 44 ] .

To scaffold the educational game design process and make better games to be used in education contexts , researchers have proposed several solutions to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration , such as using learning science principles [ 2 ] , design patterns [ 22 , 27 ] , and card - based tools [ 13 , 42 ] . Learning science principles are sci - entific , theoretical , and highly synthesized prescriptions about how students learn and how to optimize learning [ 4 , 18 ] . They can be used to inform instructional decision making , optimize educational practices , and improve learning outcomes [ 24 ] . Other studies have explored design patterns , which are practical , reusable sets of design solutions and examples [ 3 ] . Specifically , a prior study on another type of serious game ( brain injury therapy games ) showed that de - sign patterns effectively facilitated designer - therapist collaboration in the game ideation phase , which indicates that presenting design patterns as a prototype tool has the potential to help produce better games when an interdisciplinary team of designers and subject matter experts is involved [ 8 ] . In the game design industry , digital or physical card - based tools are also well - adopted at the ideation phase to serve different functionalities , such as refreshing concepts using keywords and triggering reflection with questions [ 33 , 36 ] . While there has been an abundance of work in support tools for games and learning technology design , few studies have directly examined the application of learning science principles on the de - sign process of educational games , and no prior study turned these learning science principles into digital cards to test out their influ - ence on the early ideation phase of a design process . Furthermore , given the variety of forms and formats in which information can be presented to facilitate design communication , such as prescriptions of learning science principles , examples in design patterns , and questions in design cards , it is important to understand the influ - ence of the ways information is presented to the interdisciplinary team , but few studies have tackled it . Therefore , we propose this study aiming to examine the following research questions in an educational game design context : RQ1 : Would the usage of learning science principles improve the quality of the design product ? RQ2 : How would the presentation format of the principles influ - ence the quality of the design product ? RQ3 : How would the presentation and the formats of the princi - ples influence the interdisciplinary collaboration process ? 2 RELATED WORK Designisasolution - focused , creative , andhighly cognitively - involved problem - solving and knowledge construction process [ 11 , 21 ] . Com - plex collaborative design projects that involve multidisciplinary 117 CHI PLAY ’21 , October 18 – 21 , 2021 , Virtual Event , Austria Ma and Harpstead teams can be benefited from design support tools to address the diffi - culties in information sharing and knowledge construction [ 14 , 47 ] . Educational game design relies heavily on interdisciplinary collab - oration . Therefore , the productivity of this process , as well as the diversity and creativity of the design product , can all be improved by design support tools that facilitate idea exchange and generation [ 15 , 30 , 44 ] . To motivate our proposed study , we first review some common design support tools used in educational game design , and then discuss multiple formats in which these design support tools are presented to guide and inform designers . We also present insights from the psychology and education literatures on the cognitive bases of different presentation formats to explain why they could boost collaboration and creativity . 2 . 1 Educational Game Design Support Tools Learning science researchers have produced many lists of principles of effective instructional design , some of which specifically target game - based learning [ 17 , 24 , 28 ] . These learning science principles have been incorporated into the design process as learning tech - niques , pedagogical features , or instructional components , which often take the form of brief prescriptions or keywords [ 5 , 6 , 39 ] . For example , educational game design frameworks like EDGE sug - gest the incorporation of learning science principles during the collaborative design process of educational games [ 2 ] . However , most of these frameworks simply inform designers that they need to employ these scientific findings , with little guidance on how to apply those known learning science principles , resulting in a gap between theory and practice [ 9 ] . Other bodies of work on design support tools proposed design patterns that incorporate both learning and gaming elements and provide support mostly in a form of context , problem , solution , and example [ 22 , 27 ] , which are more favorable by design practitioners [ 9 ] . Researchers have found that design patterns are capable of solving recurring problems , supporting information sharing and communication across disciplines , and fostering creativity in the ideation phase of serious game design [ 8 ] . Card - based tools , digital or physical , have been embraced by prac - titioners and widely examined in collaborative design and creativity support tool literature . They are effective for scaffolding multidisci - plinary collaborative design in that they can improve knowledge construction , communication , and idea generation [ 25 , 33 ] . There are also cards developed specifically for serious game and educa - tional game design , which have various utilities including facilitat - ing completeness and collaboration , reducing designers’ cognitive load with keywords , pinpointing design issues , and scaffolding reflection and refinement using guiding questions [ 13 , 36 , 42 ] . 2 . 2 Presentation Formats in Collaborative Design and Creativity Support Tools There are many types of design support tools to facilitate educa - tional game design as mentioned above , but there are also different ways or formats in which these collaborative design and creativity support tools could be presented . In the collaborative and creative design literature , concrete examples and guiding questions are two frequently adopted presentation formats because of their unique benefits . 2 . 2 . 1 Concrete Examples . According to cognitive psychology and education literature , exposure to examples has been proven to im - prove understanding , organization , generalization , and discrimina - tion of concepts [ 21 , 32 ] . Concrete examples have been extensively used in design disciplines to inspire designers and help them repre - sent and compare different features [ 20 ] . They affect the originality and fluency of idea generation and the variety and quality of ideas [ 45 ] . A potential danger in the use of examples , however , is design fixation which limits designers’ creativity as designers tend to re - produce what they observe in the examples [ 31 ] . The effectiveness of examples is influenced by factors such as the quantity , diversity , type , originality , modality , timing of presentation , and stress of designers [ 10 , 40 ] . For example , studies have shown that presenting examples re - duce the diversity of generated ideas , and if only few examples are provided , it is more likely to lead to design fixation than providing a variety of examples . However , a single , uncommon example may be the most effective in producing higher quality , more novel ideas [ 40 ] . Moreover , presenting original examples can better trigger creativity than random examples [ 38 ] , but it may hinder fluency of idea generation [ 45 ] , and presenting alternative perspectives in varied examples facilitates digestion of complex ideas [ 21 ] . A previous study has examined the effects of design principle cards on the quality , quantity , and novelty of ideas generated [ 29 ] . They found that presenting textual descriptions of principles with illustrations and real world examples is an effective approach in inspiring designers , especially those with limited expertise in a specific subject area , which is very common in interdisciplinary collaboration such as educational game design . Despite using varied formats of texts , i . e . , descriptions and examples , this study did not probe the potentially distinct influence of different presentation formats of the principles . Our study aims to address this gap by varying the presentation of design supports to different groups of designers . 2 . 2 . 2 Guiding Questions . Studies have used various research meth - ods to study the use of guiding questions in learning environments . Some found guiding questions to have a positive influence over stu - dents’ understanding , explanation , argumentation , reflection , and collaboration in classroom for various ages of students [ 16 , 23 , 46 ] . Others have found that guiding questions may not be as effective in a collaborative setting compared to when students work on their own , in that multiple students working together may pose questions to each other , thus reducing the benefits of externally provided guiding questions [ 41 ] . Nonetheless , guiding questions have been proven effective in supporting complex problem - solving and collaborative learning as they foster students’ higher - order thinking and metacognitive strategies [ 23 ] . Asking questions has been considered a useful teaching strategy to help students consolidate new information , connect to their prior knowledge , and stimulate their creative potential for divergent thinking . However , the power of guided inquiry depends on the quantity , depth , and specificity of questions , and the autonomy of students [ 12 , 21 , 32 , 34 ] . Open - ended guiding questions are shown to support the recall of conceptual and procedural knowledge as 118 Educational Game Design Support CHI PLAY ’21 , October 18 – 21 , 2021 , Virtual Event , Austria well as cognitive and metacognitive abilities including creation , evaluation , and analysis [ 43 ] . Despite the abundance of theoretical work of questioning strategies in the fields of cognitive psychology and education , and the common use of guiding questions in actual design practice through ideation cards [ 33 , 36 ] , no prior study has directly examine the effects of guiding questions in early phases of collaborative design processes , which is a target of our study . 3 PROPOSED STUDY Our proposed study tries to understand if the presence of learning science principles and the different formats in which the principles are presented will influence the quality of design products and the effectiveness of collaboration , and if so , in what ways . To answer our research questions , our study will investigate the following three presentation formats of learning science principles in a digital card - based design support tool : prescriptive statements , guiding questions , and concrete examples . Most learning science principles that appear in the literature are presented in a simple prescriptive statement , for example , “space practice across time > mass practice all at once” is a prescription of the spacing principle , which describes the benefit of leaving some time in between practice opportunities [ 24 ] . Nevertheless , it may not be the most effective form of presentation in comparison to a guiding question like “When do players get opportunities to practice skills in your game ? ” or a concrete example like “Duolingo encourages users to take a break in between lessons by providing incentives for streaks of practicing multiple days in a row . ” There - fore , we propose the following hypotheses in correspondence to our research questions : H1 : Using the design support of learning science principles will produce a better product than not having any support . H2 : There will be differences in product quality with different formats of principles in the design support tool . H3 : There will be differences in collaboration dynamics with or without the presentation of principles , as well as with different formats . 3 . 1 Methods To test our proposed hypotheses on the presentation format of learningscience principlesin realistic designsituations andexamine their effectiveness in supporting designer - teacher collaboration , we will use methodologies similar to a previous study on a serious game design support tool [ 8 ] . Specifically , we will conduct game ideation workshops with our design support tool , which will be a web - based interface with learning science principles shown in flippable digital cards . 3 . 1 . 1 Game Ideation Workshop Protocol . For each of 4 conditions ( prescriptive statement - PS , guiding question - GQ , concrete ex - ample - CE , and control group - CG ) , we plan to recruit 4 pairs of participants , each made up of one game designers and one teacher or instructional designer . Teachers or instructional designers should have a comparable amount of experience creating instructional materials for and working with middle school students on math subjects , in accordance to the design prompt that we plan to use in the game ideation workshop . A total of 16 educators and 16 designers will be chosen with a comparable level of expertise ( e . g . , 2 - 5 years ) in their respective areas as a student or in the field . Each game ideation workshop will involve a pair of a designer and a teacher , and they will be assigned to one of the 4 condition groups ( PS , GQ , CE , CG ) . They will be provided with the same design prompt of an educational game for a computer science class , “design an individual game to help 9 - 10th grade students learn the concepts of loop and conditional in python on their personal laptops , ” with a main learning goal of “improving students’ compu - tational thinking about loop and conditionals and clarify miscon - ceptions , ” and a secondary goal of “improve students’ interest in computer science and engagement in the course . ” Each pair of participants will be asked to collaboratively con - ceive a game idea and produce a written game design pitch given a template to illustrate the game concept and gameplay . This would be a 90 - minutes game ideation workshop conducted through Zoom remote meeting , where audio and screen recordings will be col - lected . 3 . 1 . 2 Design Support Tool . Depending on their assigned condi - tion , participants will ( or will not in CG ) be provided with a design support tool presenting learning science principles in the corre - sponding formats , i . e . , prescriptive statements , guiding questions , or concrete examples ( Fig . 1 ) . The design support tool used in the game ideation workshops will be adapted from the simplified version [ 26 ] of a website that presents learning science principles in flippable digital cards [ 19 ] . The presented principles will be taken from a list of 30 learning science principles compiled by Koedinger , Booth , and Klahr [ 24 ] , excluding 5 multimedia principles ( 19 - 24 ) , which were deemed inappropriate to the study design as they relate to final polish of a game implementation than to early ideation stages of game design that will be the focus of our design workshops . Figure 1 : Prototype Sketch of the Design Support Tool and an Example in the PS , GQ , CE Conditions . 3 . 2 Measures In the game ideation workshops , we will collect design pitches of game concepts , which will then be used for evaluating the quality of participants’ design product . We also plan to collect recordings of 119 CHI PLAY ’21 , October 18 – 21 , 2021 , Virtual Event , Austria Ma and Harpstead the workshops , participants’ responses to a post - workshop survey , and their interaction data with the design support tool , which will be used to analyze the dynamics and effectiveness of the collabora - tive game design process . 3 . 2 . 1 Game Concept Quality . After design ideation workshops , participants’ final design pitches will be anonymously evaluated in game evaluation interviews . The semi - structured Zoom interviews will be separately conducted with an expert game designer , an educational subject matter expert , and learning scientists , who will all have more experience in their respective field ( e . g . , 5 years + ) . These experts will look at the game design pitches developed in workshops and evaluate the quality of the game concepts with given rubrics , which will include 5 - point Likert scale questions about the game’s mechanics , theme , concept , cognitive difficulty , engagement , educational effectiveness in addressing the presented learning goals , and some open - ended questions about experts’ general impressions on the game pitch . 3 . 2 . 2 Collaborative Design Process . Similar to the previous study [ 8 ] , the participants of the game ideation workshops will be pro - vided with a survey asking about their satisfaction with the collab - oration process and the design support tool . The survey responses will help us understand participants’ subjective experiences collab - orating with their partner using the design support tool and also provide valuable feedback on how to further improve the tool and the presented principles to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration . Additionally , the game ideation workshop recordings will be inductively coded in a 10 - second window to encode the primary collaboration activity in the window , such as explanation , question , concern , idea suggestion , etc . Two coders will create a codebook and check for inter - rater reliability on their qualitative thematic analysis [ 7 , 37 ] . We will also collect information about when and for how long participants view certain principles by tracking participants’ in - teraction with the design support tool using interaction telemetry on the support tool . The click patterns will help us analyze the activity level during the interdisciplinary collaboration process and highlight the potentially different ways of using the design support tool by game designers and teachers . 3 . 3 Anticipated Findings The evidence of expert evaluation results of the design pitches , participants’ survey responses , the qualitative coding of the video , and the click - tracking of the design support tool usage will help us better understand the collaboration dynamics of teams in each condition in more granular details . In particular , guiding questions and concrete examples could foster designer - teacher collaboration in different ways , where the former may facilitate higher - order reflections and help designers or educators better frame their con - fusions , and the latter may help them quickly see how principles can be applied in practice and transfer useful features to their game designs . We hypothesize that presenting learning science principles in either guiding question or concrete example format will lead to smoother collaboration and better game designs than in prescrip - tive statements , but presenting any of them is better than providing nothing ( control group ) . Thus , for example , if the design pitches in all three conditions are rated as better than those in the control group , it will suggest that the use of learning science principles is indeed beneficial in the educational game design process . If participants in the guiding ques - tion condition voice fewer concerns or confusions and participants in the concrete example condition suggest more ideas than those in the prescriptive statement condition , it will support our hypothesis that presentation formats contribute to better collaboration in the design process in specific ways . 4 FUTURE WORK We are currently recruiting participants for our study , so the next steps will be to to conduct workshops and evaluation interviews , code and perform data analysis as planned , and interpret the results with our hypotheses . Understanding how to effectively present learning science prin - ciples in an educational game design context can shed lights on both theoretical research of learning science principles and applied endeavors of interdisciplinary game development , and it will be a valuable translational resource that helps bridge the gap between theoretical work and practical applications [ 9 ] .
