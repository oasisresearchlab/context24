1308 volume 41 | number 12 | december 2009 Nature GeNetics l e t t e r s We performed a genome - wide association study ( GWAS ) in 1 , 713 individuals of European ancestry with Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) and 3 , 978 controls . After replication in 3 , 361 cases and 4 , 573 controls , we observed two strong association signals , one in the gene encoding a - synuclein ( SNCA ; rs2736990 , OR = 1 . 23 , P = 2 . 24 × 10 −16 ) and another at the MAPT locus ( rs393152 , OR = 0 . 77 , P = 1 . 95 × 10 −16 ) . We exchanged data with colleagues performing a GWAS in Japanese PD cases . Association to PD at SNCA was replicated in the Japanese GWAS 1 , confirming this as a major risk locus across populations . We replicated the effect of a new locus detected in the Japanese cohort ( PARK16 , rs823128 , OR = 0 . 66 , P = 7 . 29 × 10 −8 ) and provide supporting evidence that common variation around LRRK2 modulates risk for PD ( rs1491923 , OR = 1 . 14 , P = 1 . 55 × 10 −5 ) . These data demonstrate an unequivocal role for common genetic variants in the etiology of typical PD and suggest population - specific genetic heterogeneity in this disease . Advances in genotyping technology have allowed rapid genome - wide screening of common variants in large populations , launching a new era in the investigation of the genetic basis of complex diseases . So far , GWAS have contributed little in the field of PD 2 – 4 , likely because previous studies lacked the power to detect effects of the size expected in these diseases . The present study was designed as a two - stage GWAS . Characteristics of the cohorts are shown in Table 1 . For stage I , genotyping was per - formed using Infinium BeadChips ( Illumina ) . After quality control , 463 , 185 SNPs were analyzed in 1 , 713 PD cases and 3 , 978 controls . To assess the homogeneity of our cohort , pairwise identity - by - state ( IBS ) distances were calculated using HapMap data as a reference . These analyses revealed that our samples share common European ancestry ( Supplementary Figs . 1 and 2 ) . We chose not to use genomic control because false positive association , possibly caused by popula - tion substructure ( λ = 1 . 17 ) , would be controlled for by our two - stage design . Power calculations showed our sample had 80 % power to detect variants conferring an odds ratio ( OR ) of 1 . 3 with an allele frequency of 10 % ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Each SNP was tested for association using a Cochran - Armitage genotypic trend model .

Three SNPs at the MAPT locus on chromosome 17q21 also surpassed genome - wide significance in stage I ( most significant P = 5 . 05 × 10 −8 , rs199533 ) . A logistic regres - sion analysis , adjusted for the two first components of the multi - dimensional scaling values after calculation of pairwise IBS distance , suggested that the significant results obtained are not biased by popu - lation substructure ( see Supplementary Note ) . Replication comprised genotyping of the 384 most associated SNPs after stage 1 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Genotyping was performed in an independent cohort of 3 , 452 cases and 4 , 756 controls from the United States , Germany and Britain . Taking into account the results obtained from pairwise IBS distance calculations and considering that genetic heterogeneity and allelic heterogeneity are not likely to produce type I and type II errors when North American and North European populations of European descent are pooled , we decided to analyze all stage II samples together . After quality control filtering , 345 SNPs were analyzed in 3 , 361 cases and 4 , 573 controls . Twenty - one SNPs within the SNCA and MAPT loci surpassed the Bonferroni threshold for significance ( P < 0 . 000145 ; Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2 ) . Three hundred forty - five stage II SNPs passed our quality control procedures ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Notably , we observed clusters of SNPs showing improved association signals when our stage I and stage II datasets were combined ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Although some of these SNPs are at loci that contain biologically plausible can - didate genes for PD , they did not reach genome - wide significance , and thus , we have resisted drawing conclusions from these data ; however , of particular note is a cluster of seven SNPs on chromosome 10q24 . 32 with P values < 1 × 10 −3 ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . These and other variants showing a consistent , moderate association across stages war - rant independent replication . To further delineate the signals at SNCA and MAPT , we tested the allelic association of significant SNPs conditioned on alleles of other significant SNPs at the same locus . No independent signals were identified from this test , suggesting that a single detectible patho - genic variant exists at each locus ( Supplementary Table 3 ) ; however , without complete sequence data across these loci , we cannot rule out independent effects . We did not find evidence for epistasis between the SNCA and MAPT risk alleles . Analysis of the linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) structure across the SNCA locus revealed two blocks of LD ( Fig . 2a ) . The 3 ′ block contains three of the four significantly associated SNPs , suggesting that the causal variant is located in the 3 ′ region of the SNCA gene . This idea is strengthened by analysis of the haplotype fre - quencies at this locus ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) and previous studies 5 . The REP1 microsatel - lite in SNCA was previously associated with PD 5 , and its pathological effect has been sug - gested to be mediated by gene expression 6 . Analysis of REP1 genotype data in 1 , 774 samples from the US cohort revealed that the risk allele of REP1 is in LD with the 3 ′ risk alleles identified here ( r 2 = 0 . 365 with rs3857059 ; Supplementary Fig . 7a ) ; thus , the associations identified at the REP1 locus and at the SNPs identified here may be the result of residual LD between these loci . This theory is supported by logistic regression analysis conditioned on REP1 genotypes , showing that the association at REP1 is not inde - pendent of the association identified here . We recently reported a significant association of SNCA SNPs with another synucleinopathy , multiple system atrophy ( MSA ; P = 5 . 5 × 10 −12 ) 7 ; comparison of these data reveals disparate SNCA risk SNPs in MSA and PD , a finding that may shed light on the exact pathogenic substrate and molecular etio - logy of these disorders ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . As expected , one large , highly inter - correlated block of high LD was observed across the MAPT locus ( Fig . 2b ) . Available genotype data of the H1 and H2 haplotypes in this region showed that the risk alleles of the associated SNPs are in LD with the H1 haplotype ( r 2 = 0 . 761 with rs393152 ; Supplementary Fig . 7b ) . It is unclear from the current data whether the MAPT PD - risk haplotype identified here corresponds to table 1 study characteristics of cases and controls in stage I and II Cases Controls Sample size Mean aao ( s . d . ) Male / female ratio Sample size Mean aae ( s . d . ) Male / female ratio Stage I United States 988 55 . 9 ( 15 . 1 ) 1 . 09 3 , 071 61 . 8 ( 15 . 6 ) 0 . 96 Germany 757 55 . 6 ( 11 . 6 ) 1 . 49 976 NA 1 . 08 Stage II United States 1 , 528 62 . 5 ( 8 . 6 ) 2 . 44 2 , 044 63 . 2 ( 15 . 6 ) 2 . 45 Germany 1 , 100 60 . 8 ( 11 . 3 ) 1 . 37 2 , 168 57 . 1 ( 10 . 5 ) 1 . 40 UK 824 58 . 7 ( 12 . 3 ) 3 . 50 544 NA 0 . 57 Aao , age at onset ; aae , age at examination ; NA , not available .

Because of the LD struc - ture , we cannot rule out the possibility that other genes at this locus are the pathogenically relevant genes ; however , MAPT is biologically the most plausible candidate . Following data exchange with colleagues performing a PD GWAS in Japan , we chose to study two loci on chromosomes 1q32 and 4p15 found to be associated with PD in the Japanese population 1 . In our stage I data , the most significant P values at the 12 SNPs found in the Japanese GWAS were 1 . 3 × 10 −4 and 6 . 5 × 10 −3 ( 1q32 and 4p15 . 3 , respectively ) . The signal at 1q32 was significant enough to carry through to stage II replication , but this SNP had been excluded from consideration because of its low minor allele frequency in controls ( 0 . 03 ) . Genotyping of these 12 SNPs was performed in an available subset of our replication cohort comprising 2 , 816 cases and 3 , 401 controls . The signal on chromosome 1q32 was replicated in this cohort ( rs823128 , P = 1 . 9 × 10 −4 ; Table 2 ) . Although this locus did not surpass Bonferroni - corrected significance , the P value across stages was highly significant ( rs823128 , P = 7 . 3 × 10 −8 ) , and it is worth noting that the significance improved for all SNPs at this locus when stage I and II results were combined ( Fig . 2c ) . For these reasons and because the association at this locus ( designated PARK16 ) was consistently detected in the Japanese cohort 1 , we are confident that this signal represents a true association to PD . Although we failed to replicate the signal on chromosome 4p15 , which included only one gene , BST1 , the low minor allele frequency of the associated SNPs in individuals of European descent may have affected our ability to observe an association . Mutations in SNCA and MAPT have been associated with autosomal dominant forms of parkinsonism 9 , 10 . Given this , it is interesting that table 2 top three sNPs at the two loci that surpass Bonferroni threshold for multiple testing in both stages and top three sNPs at the LRRK2 locus and additional loci on chromosomes 1 and 4 Locus Stage I Stage II Stage I + II combined SNP Chr .

Nature GeNetics volume 41 | number 12 | december 2009 1311 l e t t e r s we observed association to PD proximal to LRRK2 , which also contains mutations causing autosomal dominant PD 11 , 12 . In stage I , 23 SNPs upstream of LRRK2 and 12 SNPs within LRRK2 were associated with PD ( lowest P = 5 . 03 × 10 −6 at rs2896905 , located in SLC2A13 , 0 . 27 Mb upstream of LRRK2 ) . Of these , three SNPs surpassed our threshold for replication and were analyzed in stage II . Only one SNP , 0 . 17 Mb upstream of LRRK2 , remained associated with PD after stage II analysis ( rs1491923 , P = 0 . 01 ; Table 2 and Fig . 2d ) . Although this did not surpass our threshold for multiple testing , the combined stage I and II P values revealed a suggestive association to PD ( P = 1 . 6 × 10 −5 ) . Notably , the other two replicated SNPs at this locus were also nominally associated with PD after the stage I and stage II datasets were combined ( P values = 9 . 5 × 10 −5 and 7 . 8 × 10 −3 ; rs11564612 and rs2896905 , respectively ) . Data from the Japanese cohort also revealed a significant association with PD at this locus 1 . SLC2A13 , neighboring LRRK2 , cannot be ruled out as the gene of effect at this locus ; however , given the existing evidence linking LRRK2 with familial forms of PD , this gene is clearly the more plausible candidate 11 , 12 . Although mutations and copy number variants of SNCA are the cause of rare familial forms of PD 10 , 13 , association of common variants has been a subject of dispute . This study provides unequivocal evi - dence that variation in SNCA contributes to the etiology of sporadic PD . The clustering of associated SNPs in the 3 ′ untranslated region suggests that the causal variant might affect post - transcriptional RNA processing or RNA stability , possibly mediated by microRNA binding sites or by alternative splicing . Association of the H1 haplotype at the MAPT locus with PSP and CBD has been described and replicated 8 ; however , association studies of variants at MAPT in PD have produced conflicting results 14 , 15 . Our data provide unequivocal evidence for an association of the MAPT locus with PD . This is notable given the classic separation of synuclei - nopathies and tauopathies , although a cross - talk between molecular pathways characterized by different aggregating proteins has been repeatedly suggested . Though there are additional genes at the MAPT locus , the role of MAPT in neurodegenerative diseases is well estab - lished , and this association is biologically plausible . We provide evidence for an association of PD with variability proximal to LRRK2 and at a new locus at 1q32 ( PARK16 ) . The kinase activity of LRRK2 is an attractive therapeutic target ; our data suggests that this protein is also relevant to the etiology in sporadic PD cases without LRRK2 mutations . The PARK16 locus spans five transcripts : SLC45A3 , NUCKS1 , RAB7L1 , SLC41A1 and PM20D1 . In the future , it will be important to define the immediate biological consequences of all four risk loci identified here . It is notable that three of the most significant loci identified here contain genes known to be mutated in mendelian forms of parkinsonism . This supports the notion that rare familial disease is etiologically related to typical sporadic PD and suggests that genes that contain common risk variants are excellent candidates to also contain rare disease - causing mutations . One might also predict that deep sequencing of these loci will reveal rare mutations that alter risk for , rather than cause , disease . It is also inter - esting that two of the four loci discussed here are risk factors for other neurodegenerative diseases , including MSA ( SNCA ) , PSP ( MAPT ) and CBD ( MAPT ) . The combined population - attributable risk associated with the identified loci , considering the genotypic counts of the most associated SNPs in our cohort , is approximately 25 % ( see Online Methods ) . Our study was a retrospective case - control study , and the frequency of the risk variants detected might not reflect the frequencies of true causal variants ; thus , these values should be interpreted with caution . In an attempt to define a biological consequence of risk variants , we mined data produced within our laboratory . In this work , genome - wide genotyping and expression profiling of > 22 , 000 transcripts was performed in 133 human frontal cortex samples , allowing us to deter - mine which SNPs are significantly associated with gene expression level ( P = 1 × 10 −3 ) . These data revealed a strong association between genotype at the risk alleles of the MAPT locus and expression levels of both MAPT and LRRC37A ( Fig . 3 ) , in addition to less significant association with expression levels of other transcripts at this locus , but they did not reveal association between risk SNPs and expres - sion levels of proximal genes at the SNCA , LRRK2 or PARK16 loci ( Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Notably , the alleles at the MAPT locus associated with increased risk of PD are associated with increased expression of MAPT in the human brain . Our study shows a clear role for common genetic variability in the risk of developing PD . Further , we describe a possible population - specific genetic heterogeneity in this disorder , as the association with MAPT was absent in the Japanese study 1 .

The results of the analysis are shown as log - transformed P values color coded to match the transcript of interest . Notably , genotypes across this locus are associated with MAPT ( pink ) and LRRC37A ( blue ) levels . ( b , c ) Box plots illustrate a dose relationship between allele load at the most significantly associated PD SNP ( rs393152 ) and expression of MAPT ( b ) and LRRC37A ( c ) ; P values 4 . 1 × 10 −6 and 1 . 7 × 10 −13 , respectively . Notably , the allele associated with higher risk for PD , A , is associated with higher levels of MAPT expression and lower levels of LRRC37A expression . © 2009 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . 1312 volume 41 | number 12 | december 2009 Nature GeNetics such genetic heterogeneity , particularly at minor risk loci , has the potential to mask true associations when analyses are performed across populations . With the discovery of the PARK16 locus in the Japanese population , this finding highlights the power of comparing GWAS across different populations . A further increase in the number and size of cohorts for GWAS in PD will likely reveal additional com - mon genetic risk loci , and these , in turn , will improve understanding and , ultimately , treatment of this devastating disorder .

Stage I of our study comprised a total of 5 , 820 individuals originally from the United States and Germany . All participants gave written informed consent , and approval was obtained from the relevant local ethical committees for medical research . All patients were diagnosed according to the UK Brain Bank criteria 16 . Details are provided in the Supplementary Note . Stage I genotyping . All samples were genotyped using Infinium Beadchips ( Illumina ) . These chips allow the genotyping of tagSNPs derived from Phase I and Phase II International HapMap Project 17 and display a comprehensive genomic coverage across populations of European descent . On average , there is 1 common SNP every 5 . 5 kb across the genome in the CEU population . Genotyping of the samples was performed with either HumanHap550 v1 beadchips , HumanHap550 v3 beadchips or with a combination of HumanHap300 and HumanHap240S beadchips ( providing the same genotype information as the HumanHap550 v1 beadchips ) . Using these platforms , 507 , 861 unique SNPs were genotyped for each sample . Details are provided in the Supplementary Note . Stage I quality control . Samples were excluded for the following reasons : low call rates , gender ambiguity , non - European ancestry and evidence of related - ness . SNPs were excluded from the analysis based on call rates , low minor allele frequencies ( MAF ) and departure from Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium . Details are provided in the Supplementary Note . Stage I statistical analysis . Quanto software was used to estimate power . Odds ratios considering a P value of 1 . 7 × 10 −7 ( genome - wide significance level after Bonferroni correction ) and different minor allele frequencies were cal - culated . These simulations revealed 80 % power to detect variants exerting a risk for PD with an OR as low as 1 . 3 in our stage I cohort ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . For association analyses , all estimates and tests were performed with the PLINK toolset 18 . For each SNP that successfully passed our quality control process , MAF and HWE filters , a Cochran - Armitage trend test of association was applied based on the Fisher theory of additivity . OR , 95 % CI and P values were calculated for each test performed ( each SNP ) . Because a large number of tests were performed , conservative Bonferroni corrections were applied to correct for multiple testing . Stage II subjects . Stage II included a total of 8 , 208 individuals of European ancestry . All participants gave written informed consent , and approval was obtained from the relevant local ethical committees for medical research . Details are provided in the Supplementary Note . Stage II genotyping . For stage II , 384 SNPs were selected based on the P value observed in stage I under the trend model of association and predicted assay efficiency following Illumina guidelines ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Each of the samples was independently typed for these 384 SNPs using GoldenGate technology for VeraCode platform from Illumina . Details are provided in the Supplementary Note . In addition to the 384 SNPs from the stage I analysis , 12 SNPs were genotyped on chromosomes 1 and 4 ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . These were genotyped using the matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization time of flight ( MALDI - TOF ) mass spectrometry method ( MassArray system , Sequenom ) . Stage II quality control . To check the accuracy of this methodology , 96 samples previously genotyped in stage I of this project were re - assayed with GoldenGate . Those SNPs in which genotypes were not in agreement across 10 or more samples ( ~ 10 % ) were considered as consistent failures and removed from further analyses . This approach led to the exclusion of 11 non - concordant SNPs . After removing these SNPs from our dataset , genotyping concordance between HumanHap550 BeadChips and GoldenGate was greater than 99 . 2 % . Visual examination of SNP clusters using Beadstudio led to the removal of 12 more SNPs , resulting in a total of 23 SNPs that were excluded from further analysis . SNPs genotyped in less than 90 % of the samples , with a MAF below 5 % or with an extreme departure from Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium ( P < 1 × 10 −7 ) were also removed . After the initial removal of all samples with a call rate below 90 % and following the quality control procedures described above , our stage II dataset consisted of 345 SNPs genotyped in a total of 3 , 361 cases and 4 , 573 controls . Stage II statistical analysis . Power calculations were performed as described in stage I . Considering a P value of 1 . 44 × 10 −4 ( genome - wide significance level after Bonferroni correction for 345 SNPs ) and different minor allele frequen - cies , these simulations showed that our stage II sample had 80 – 90 % power to detect a variant exerting a risk with an OR as low as 1 . 2 ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . Association analyses were performed as described for stage I . Secondary analyses . The LD structure of the identified loci was analyzed using Haploview 4 . 1 ( ref . 19 ) and LD blocks delimited using the D ′ - based confidence interval method developed by Gabriel et al . 20 . For the SNCA locus , haplotypes were counted using Haploview and risk values plotted with R ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . To check if the association signal detected in SNCA was in significant LD with that previously reported for the REP1 microsatellite , genotype data at this marker was included in a subset of 1 , 774 US samples from our stage I ( REP1 genotyping performed as previously described 5 ) . LD calculations revealed that both our risk allele at the 3 ′ end of SNCA and the risk allele of REP1 tag the same risk haplotype ( D ′ = 0 . 872 and r 2 = 0 . 365 ) ( Supplementary Fig . 7a ) . To further substantiate this finding , we performed a logistic regression analy - sis conditioned on the genotypes at REP1 . Results derived from this analysis show a drop in the association detected at rs2736990 from P = 0 . 003649 to P = 0 . 03934 , suggesting that variation at REP1 and at this SNP are not inde - pendent of each other . To compare the signals of the MAPT locus with previous studies , we included genotype data of the H1 and H2 polymorphism . One hundred fifty - four individuals of the stage II sample were genotyped with previously described methods 21 . The remaining H1 and H2 genotypes were imputed in the combined cohort . These genotypes were used to compute LD between the H1 and H2 polymorphism and the genotyped SNPs ( D ′ = 0 . 902 and r 2 = 0 . 742 ) ( Supplementary Fig . 7b ) . To define whether there were multiple independent effects at MAPT and SNCA , conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate the effects of indi - vidual SNPs at these loci . Additive minor allele dosages for each SNP in com - bined German and US samples were used in the conditional models to test for possible independence of association . The tight linkage at the MAPT locus contributed to a collinearity of effects for each SNP , causing no significant parameters in the additive models to be identified in the conditional regres - sion models . In analyses of the SNCA locus , a single SNP ( rs2736990 , OR = 1 . 21 , P = 0 . 0034 ) showed some degree of possible independence of association when conditioning the regression on neighboring genic SNPs . Because these SNPs often serve as proxies for the actual functional variant ( s ) identified in follow - up , we estimate that a relatively narrow credible interval of ~ 33 kb surrounding this SNP as an ideal target for future re - sequencing to identify additional functional variant ( s ) associated with PD risk at SNCA . Test of epistatic interaction . To test for an interaction between SNCA and MAPT loci , we used a likelihood ratio test . Forward selection procedure was used to develop a final model to test an epistatic interaction . In brief , both unrestricted and restricted models were fitted using the maximum likelihood method . PAR . We computed population attributable risk ( PAR ) for SNCA and MAPT . PAR % was calculated using the formula : PAR = ( p [ OR – 1 ] ) / ( p [ OR – 1 ] + 1 ) × 100 where p is the prevalence of the risk allele in the population and OR is the odds ratio . As there was no evidence of interaction , we further estimated the combined population attributable ( cPAR ) risk for these genes using the fol - lowing formula cPAR = 1 − ( 1 − PAR SNCA ) × ( 1 − PAR MAPT ) . Comparison of MSA , PD and control SNCA risk genotypes . Genotype and allele frequencies were selected from 92 pathologically proven MSA cases that had previously been genotyped for the selected SNCA variants and published by us 7 . The frequency of these variants was compared to that observed in stage II PD and control groups using Haploview 19 ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . Expression analysis . Frozen tissue samples of the frontal cortex were obtained from 133 neurologically normal subjects of European ancestry . Genotyping © 2009 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . Nature GeNetics doi : 10 . 1038 / ng . 487 was performed using Infinium HumanHap550 BeadChips ( Illumina ) followed by imputation to ~ 1 . 6 million SNPs . After data cleaning , profiling of 22 , 000 mRNA transcripts was performed using HumanRef - 8 Expression BeadChips ( Illumina ) as previously described 22 . A regression analysis was performed on the expression intensities generated for mRNA . Gender , age , postmortem interval , tissue source and hybridization batch were included as covariates . Residuals from the regression analysis for each probe were then used as the quantitative trait for that probe in genome - wide association analysis looking for quantitative trait loci . The sequences of probes with significant correlation to a trait were exam - ined for the presence of polymorphisms using CEU HapMap data , and , if present , that QTL was removed from the result set . Notably , we failed to detect sufficient expression at the probe for LRRK2 , thus precluding analysis of the levels of this transcript as a quantitative trait ( Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) .
