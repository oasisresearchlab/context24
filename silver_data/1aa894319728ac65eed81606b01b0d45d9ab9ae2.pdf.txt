To identify the mechanism by which different membrane deformations can be achieved , we reconstitute the basic membrane deformation modes of inward and outward bending in a con ﬁ ned geometry by encapsulating a minimal set of cytoskeletal proteins into giant unilamellar vesicles . Formation of membrane protrusions is favoured at low capping protein ( CP ) concentrations , whereas the formation of negatively bent domains is promoted at high CP concentrations . Addition of non - muscle myosin II results in full ﬁ ssion events in the vesicle system . The different deformation modes are rationalized by simulations of the underlying transient nature of the reaction kinetics . The relevance of the regulatory mechanism is supported by CP overexpression in mouse melanoma B16 - F1 cells and therefore demonstrates the importance of the quantitative understanding of microscopic kinetic balances to address the diverse functionality of the cytoskeleton .

One key player is the nucleating Arp2 / 3 com - plex , which initiates the formation of the dendritic - like , branched networks at the plasma membrane and leads to the propulsion of spherical objects 12 – 16 in absence of any motor proteins . ATP hydrolysis driven ﬁ lament polymerization against the plasma membrane is suf ﬁ cient to push the membrane forward . Thereby the resulting membrane growth speed depends on the number of pushing actin ﬁ laments 17 , 18 . The biochemical properties of the Arp2 / 3 complex have been well characterized 19 , 20 . The Arp2 / 3 complex is activated by VCA ( verprolin , central , acidic ) domains of N - WASP ( Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ) and SCAR / WAVE ( suppressor of cAMP receptor / WASP - family verprolin - homologous protein ) proteins at the plasma membrane to create new branches from preexisting mother ﬁ laments . Coupled to the outside of a lipid vesicle , such actin networks can create suf ﬁ cient forces to produce protrusions into the vesicle by self - stabilization of the membrane 21 . Surprisingly , the very same nucleation and growth processes are also thought to be responsible for the for - mation of negative curvatures in the plasma membrane and ﬁ nal membrane ﬁ ssion , as found in endocytosis 22 – 25 . However , still very little is known about the processes that allow cells to switch between these two fundamentally different deformation modes . Clearly , the microscopic organization of the actin cytoskeleton de ﬁ nes its function , yet how it is achieved remains to be resolved . A central regulator of the microscopic network properties is heterodimeric capping protein ( CP ) 15 , 26 – 29 . It binds to actin ﬁ lament barbed ends to inhibit polymerization 30 . In the presence of CP branching by Arp2 / 3 complex is favoured 15 , whereas depletion of CP results in the formation of actin bundles and thus switches from lamellipodium to ﬁ lopodium formation 2 , 7 , 29 . Local monomer depletion is a second parameter , which controls net - work density and architecture . The local depletion leads to dif - ferent growth velocities of the polymerizing actin network and controls steering of the actin network 31 . To study the physical principles underlying membrane defor - mation in vitro reconstitution systems are a promising approach 21 , 32 – 37 . By reconstitution of actin cortices inside of giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) it was shown that only con - tractile actin cortices are capable to drive shape remodelling and blebbing 36 , 37 , while in the absence of any molecular motors no shape deformation of the membrane could be observed 35 . In the present study , we encapsulated actin , Arp2 / 3 complex and CP inside of GUVs and localized Arp2 / 3 complex activation to the membrane by coupling His - tagged VCA to nickel - nitrilotriacetic acid ( Ni - NTA ) lipids . We show that a limited pool of actin monomers can lead to inhomogeneous actin poly - merization , where CP regulates the local actin density at the membrane . We found two distinct network architectures , which deformed the membrane either outwards or inwards . Only at high CP concentrations and in presence of the molecular motor non - muscle myosin II ( NMM II ) membrane invaginations were induced , which ultimately led to ﬁ ssion events . Simulating the underlying reaction diffusion kinetics under depleting protein pool conditions revealed that two distinct network patterns of actin growth beneath the membrane could be distinguished . The resulting inhomogeneous growth velocity pro ﬁ le of the network promoted the formation of membrane protrusions at low CP concentration and induced negative membrane curvatures at high CP concentration . Overexpression of CP in B16 - F1 cells sup - ported the role of CP in switching between these two deformation modes , since besides diminished lamellipodium formation and inhibition of microspikes , increased CP concentration markedly ampli ﬁ ed the number of intracellular vesicles . Altogether , CP controls membrane localized growth kinetics of Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymerization and thereby determines mem - brane shape deformations . Results Arp2 / 3 complex - induced polymerization at the membrane . We manufactured a minimal model system of a cytoskeletal vesicle by encapsulating actin monomers and actin - binding proteins into vesicles with a radius of 10 – 25 µm using a modi ﬁ ed emulsion transfer technique continuous droplet interface crossing encap - sulation ( cDICE ) ( Fig . 1a ) 37 , 38 . The lipid membrane was com - posed of a mixture of Egg - PC , PEG - PE and Ni - NTA . The encapsulation of actin monomers alone resulted in the sponta - neous nucleation and polymerization of actin ﬁ laments spanning the vesicle ’ s volume without any enrichment of the network at the membrane ( Fig . 1b ) . In the following series of experiments we added Arp2 / 3 complex , His - tagged VCA from N - WASP and pro ﬁ lin to the solution prior to encapsulation . Pro ﬁ lin blocks polymerization at the pointed end of actin ﬁ laments and diminishes the spontaneous actin nucleation in the vesicle ’ s volume . His - tagged VCA was tethered to the membrane by Ni - NTA lipids to restrict Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin poly - merization to the membrane resulting in localized networks due to the self - amplifying nature of Arp2 / 3 complex . Still a signi ﬁ cant amount of actin was polymerized spontaneously , resulting in a ﬁ ne volume spanning network ( Fig . 1c ) . This is consistent with measurements from bulk actin - pyrene assays , which showed that despite the presence of pro ﬁ lin actin assembly was instanta - neously initiated due to high amounts of VCA - activated Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 1d ) . CP is the central component for localized network formation . CP binds to actin ﬁ lament barbed ends and in cooperation with pro ﬁ lin suppresses spontaneous nucleation and elongation of ﬁ laments in solution as seen in actin - pyrene ﬂ uorescence mea - surements ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Measurements of pyrene ﬂ uorescence of the full system in the presence of 20 nM CP thus showed a lag phase of 1 . 5 ± 0 . 3 min in the polymerization curve ( Fig . 1d ) . During encapsulation in vesicles this lag phase should ensure that the Arp2 / 3 complex can freely diffuse to the mem - brane before its activation as nucleation of actin was effectively suppressed within the volume of the vesicles . Indeed the encap - sulation of this system into vesicles resulted for 78 % of the vesicles in the localization of actin networks at the membrane without appearance of any visible volume spanning network . Two types of network morphologies could be distinguished ( Fig . 1e ) . In 36 % of the vesicles , spatially separated actin patches ( domains ) appeared at the membrane ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . In 42 % of the vesicles , almost homogeneous closed cortices were observed . This suggests that small ﬂ uctuations of CP concentrations are already suf ﬁ cient to modify nucleation rates leading to the for - mation different domain morphologies . A further increase of CP resulted in the formation of three distinct domain morphologies of actin , which could be distin - guished based on their curvature : ( i ) convex actin protrusions ( protrusion ) with a length of up to 4 µm ( Fig . 2a ) . These were able to push forward the vesicle ’ s membrane and induced a convex deformation of the membrane ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . ( ii ) Concavely bent actin domains ( concave domain ) , which induced a localized negative curvature into the vesicle ’ s membrane ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Figure 3 ) and ( iii ) ﬂ at actin domains , which had no discernible change of membrane curvature ( Fig . 2c ) . The appearance and distribution of the different vesicle morphologies depended on the CP concentration ( Fig . 2d ) . While the vesicles with a protrusion con ﬁ guration almost exclusively appeared at 40 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 03918 - 1 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 1630 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 03918 - 1 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications nM , the concavely bent domains were observable for several CP concentrations ( from 40 to 120 nM ) ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . Only at low ( 20 nM ) and high ( 120 and 180 nM ) CP concentrations closed cortex formation was observable ( 40 % and 60 % , respectively ) ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Figure 4 ) . However , cortex morphology was distinct : at 20 nM CP the cortex appeared as an almost homogenously grown network ( Supple - mentary Figure 2 ) , whereas at 120 nM CP the cortex consisted of many small actin domains , which overlapped with each other ( Fig . 2d ) . In the latter case , concavely bent areas were observable within the cortex in 30 % of the vesicles ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . A further increase of CP to 180 nM led to the appearance of volume spanning networks ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Figure 4 ) . Importantly , only one type of domain morphology was exclusively present in each vesicle ; no vesicles were observed where two types of morphologies appeared simultaneously . We also labelled VCA with a ﬂ uorescent dye to ensure that the observed domain formation was induced by actin polymerization and not by VCA clustering . The distribution of VCA in the absence of any actin polymerization was homogeneous at the membrane for several hours ( Fig . 2e ) . Arp2 / 3 complex labelled in the same manner bound homogeneously to the membrane via the membrane adsorbed VCA molecules in the absence of any actin polymerization ( Fig . 2f ) . In the presence of localized actin polymerization VCA started to concentrate at the polymerization sites ( Fig . 2g ) . Thus , domain formation was not induced by any VCA clustering . Rather nucleation seeds of actin formed randomly at the membrane and led to an increased accumulation of VCA in the polymerizing actin domains . Domain nucleation and growth is controlled by CP . To char - acterize the growth process of the differently shaped domains we obtained time - dependent snapshots at 40 and 120 nM CP ( Fig . 3a , b ) . We observed that the time of actin seed formation at the membrane strongly depended on the CP concentration . At 40 nM CP nucleation was initiated rapidly as small actin patches appeared immediately , whereas at 120 nM CP seeds were only recognizable at a later time ( 4 min ) . After 4 min domain forma - tion was fully completed at 40 nM CP and after 7 min at 120 nM CP . The formation of concave actin domains was observed at both CP concentrations , whereas the formation of protrusions appeared only at 40 nM CP ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) . Protrusion formation was quick as compared to the formation of concave domains . Membrane deformations could be observed after 7 min ( Fig . 3a , b ) , whereas a membrane protrusion became instantly visible ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) . These observations indicate that the ﬁ nite pool of actin monomers must compete with all nucleation sites such that the monomers are already consumed before the nucleation sites can grow large enough to fuse together . Consequently , separate actin domains of different ﬁ lament density emerge at the membrane . In accordance , a correlation between the number of domains in a vesicle and the type of morphology was found ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) . The number of domains was lower for protrusions compared to concave domains and ﬂ at domains . As soon as the monomer pool was fully consumed the heterogeneities within the network remained stable for several hours . For a better characterization of CP - dependent domain growth , we performed total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence ( TIRF ) measurements of actin domains growing on a His - VCA functionalized lipid monolayer at different CP concentrations . We observed that domain growth became more con ﬁ ned and the number of domains increased with an increase of CP ( Supple - mentary Figure 7 ) . This is consistent with the CP - dependent results from the actin - pyrene measurements . Here , the lag phase before polymerization initiation increased with an increasing CP concentration , whereas polymerization speed decreased with an increase of CP ( Supplementary Figure 8 ) . NMM II is most ef ﬁ cient to bend actin domains at high CP . The diameter of the concavely bent domains was about 5 µm for 40 and 60 nM CP , respectively , while at 120 nM CP a signi ﬁ cant a Actin monomer Profilin bound Actin monomer VCA Arp2 / 3 Capping protein NiNTA - lipids + Actin + VCA + Arp2 / 3 + profilin + CP 0 12 4 120 80 40 0 16 8 t ( min ) I no r m ( a . u . ) d + VCA + Arp2 / 3 + Profilin c Actin b E qua t o r i a l p l ane + CP e E qua t o r i a l p l ane Fig . 1 Actin polymerization at the membrane is mediated by Arp2 / 3 complex and CP . a Molecular components required to produce cytoskeletal vesicles : Actin , His - tagged VCA , Arp2 / 3 complex , CP and pro ﬁ lin were encapsulated inside of giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) .

This correlated inversely to the domain curvature , which increased with an increasing CP concentration from − 0 . 1 µm − 1 to − 0 . 13 µm − 1 ( Fig . 4b ) . Scatter plots also con ﬁ rmed that the domain size directly correlated to the domain curvature . Only at domain diameters lower than 4 µm , we mea - sured curvatures higher than − 0 . 2 µm - 1 ( Fig . 4c ) . Curvatures up to − 0 . 5 µm − 1 could be observed , but in none of the vesicles the formation of strong membrane invaginations nor any ﬁ ssion events were seen . The interplay of the polymerized actin gel with the membrane was not strong enough to induce full detachment of the invaginations . Thus , we added NMM II to the solution prior to encapsulation . The resulting contractile response of the motors within the actin network was strongly dependent on the CP concentration . At 20 nM CP the presence of NMM II resulted in the formation of star - like actin clusters with a diameter of a few micrometres ( Fig . 4d ) . In some cases , global deformations of the vesicle into non - spherical shapes were observable . Here the NMM II induced tensions were balanced by the osmotic pressure 37 . The addition of NMM II at a CP concentration of 60 nM resulted in formation of domains , which remained connected to the membrane . The diameters of the domains contracted from 5 to 3 . 2 µm ( Fig . 4a ) and small membrane invaginations were discernible in 52 % of the vesicles . Complete ﬁ ssion events occurred in 3 . 7 % of the vesicles ( Fig . 4d and Supplementary Figure 10 ) . A slight curvature increase of the concave domains from − 0 . 1 µm − 1 to − 0 . 12 µm − 1 was observed ( Fig . 4b ) . A further increase of CP to 120 nM was suf ﬁ cient to promote ﬁ ssion events of membrane invaginations in 27 . 5 % of the vesicles ( Fig . 4d and Supplementary Figure 10 ) . This was consistent with a curvature increase from − 0 . 13 µm − 1 to − 0 . 22 µm − 1 ( Fig . 4b ) . The domain diameters remained constant ( Fig . 4a ) . Structure of actin domains depends on CP .

All involved protein pools are ﬁ nite , and equilibrate either by two - dimensional ( 2D ) or three - dimensional ( 3D ) diffusion processes . The network growth and chemical composition are determined by the two antagonistic key players Arp2 / 3 and CP . The Arp2 / 3 complex must be acti - vated by VCA ( Fig . 5a ) , which is localized at the membrane and needs to bind an actin monomer prior to activation . Upon acti - vation , activated Arp2 / 3 complex ( Arp2 / 3 * ) induces the nuclea - tion of new ﬁ laments by branching from an existing ﬁ lament ends . CP terminates barbed end elongation , which results in shorter ﬁ laments and less branching possibilities . The elongation and branching rates are set by the available monomer pool and the availability of Arp2 / 3 * . As all monomeric actin is incorpo - rated into the network at the membrane , we computed the network growth as the density of barbed ends with time ( Fig . 5b ) . Hence the time dependence re ﬂ ects the vertical network growth . At the start of the simulation all VCA is bound to the membrane in the inactive state , and all other proteins are monomeric inactive and in the bulk . The VCA - G actin complex formation and subsequent activation of Arp2 / 3 is almost instantaneous , while the nucleation of ﬁ rst actin ﬁ laments are delayed . These ﬁ laments are necessary to initiate network growth ( seeding ) and once they are formed a rapid increase in the density of barbed ends is observed ( initial growth ) . As the pool of available Arp2 / 3 * is ﬁ nite and capping antagonizes branching , the growth rates of barbed ends decrease ( transient phase ) and barbed end density ﬁ nally reaches a steady state . The growth processes towards the steady state are controlled by CP ( Fig . 5b ) . To observe the steady state , we ﬁ rst discuss the case of a distant in ﬁ nite reservoir of proteins , in which concentration gradients could still occur . The system started far away from equilibrium . This resulted in a branching dominated by the initial growth phase that transitioned into the CP concentration - dependent steady - state . Increasing CP concentration lowered the steady - state barbed end density ( Fig . 5c and Supplementary Figure 11 ) . The steady - state concentration of available Arp2 / 3 * was higher with increasing CP , as the available barbed end density was decreased , which in turn resulted in a lower branching rate ( Fig . 5d , e ) . Directly after a seeding event of a domain only few barbed ends were present . Increasing CP concentration resulted in a decrease of the growth rate , as also experimentally observed in pyrene assays . The low barbed end density resulted in an accumulation of Arp2 / 3 * , as VCA activated more Arp2 / 3 complex than requested by the network ( Fig . 5c , d ) . Subsequently , the high Arp2 / 3 * concentration was rapidly transformed into branches due to the self - amplifying reaction . The binding rate of CP is slower and thus it needed some time that CP could follow up and counteracted this increase of the activated Arp2 / 3 * and barbed a Lo w e r he m i s phe r e U ppe r he m i s phe r e 40 nM CP Actin Membrane 1 min 4 min 7 min 7 min Lo w e r he m i s phe r e U ppe r he m i s phe r e b Lo w e r he m i s phe r e U ppe r he m i s phe r e 120 nM CP Actin Membrane 1 min 4 min 7 min Lo w e r he m i s phe r e U ppe r he m i s phe r e 7 min Fig . 3 Snapshots of the temporal evolution of actin domain formation controlled by CP concentration are shown . a , b Projections of epi ﬂ uorescence z - stacks show the temporal evolution of actin domain formation at the membrane in the presence of 40 and 120 nM CP , respectively . a Domain formation of actin at the membrane was fast in the presence of 40 nM CP . Already one minute after production has been ﬁ nished , domains were visible at the membrane . Domain growth continued over time and a bending of the membrane was observable after 7 min ( arrows ) . b Domain formation at 120 nM CP was slowed down . One minute after production domains were not observable , after 4 min domains became visible and after seven minutes a concave shaping of the membrane was induced ( arrows ) . Please note that during the acquisition the vesicles were freely rotating and thus the domains occur at different positions in the images . To avoid bleaching effects only very limited number of snapshots was taken .

Together with the steady - state conditions two distinct cases emerged : for low CP ( 40 nM ) , the increasing barbed end density slowly levelled off to a high steady - state concentration . Simultaneously , the Arp2 / 3 * concentration rapidly reached its steady - state value . The balance between the rates of Arp2 / 3 * activation and capping resulted in a transient and weak peak of branching events . For high CP ( 80 , 120 nM ) , the initial increase in barbed end density was slower than at low CP , the resulting barbed end maximum was much higher than the steady - state level . This resulted in a peak of the barbed end densities . Next , we considered systems with ﬁ nite reservoirs and observed the spatial spreading along the membrane , which was implemented as a diffusive random walk of the barbed ends scaled by the local polymerization speed in a time dependent effective 2D simulation . In addition to the kinetic effects , now the depletion of the molecules during the growth process established gradients in the barbed end densities . The depletion of CP and actin monomers was found to be equivalent to continuously changing the starting conditions . We adjusted the simulation volume to take account for the observed number of domains that share the protein pools in the vesicles . At all CP concentrations , the behaviour discussed above was modulated by the global protein pool depletion . This corresponded to continuously dropping steady - state levels , which resulted in an initial peak for all cases . At low CP concentration ( 40 nM ) , a continuous growth with a transient peak of barbed ends density was observable , which resulted from the drop of the steady - state levels . As the actin pools get used up , the maximum of the peak decreased continuously during spreading along the membrane . The growth and spreading of the barbed end density along the membrane resulted in a ﬂ at radial distribution of barbed ends after 40 s ( Fig . 5f ) . Raising the CP concentration ( 80 nM ) , we again observed the peak of barbed end densities due to the excess in Arp2 / 3 * . As the network spread along the membrane , ﬁ laments entered membrane regions that also exhibited this excess in Arp2 / 3 * . This resulted in a polymerization wave , creating a propagating high barbed end density at the rim of the domain and a lower density in the middle ( Fig . 5f ) . At the highest here studied CP concentration ( 120 nM ) , the concentration pro ﬁ les became ﬂ at again ( Fig . 5f ) . This was due to the implementation of the number of domains in the simulation , effectively reducing the available monomer pool . This additional depletion by competition of multiple domains shows that global conditions are also essential for the growth process of the domains . Here , the experimentally observed nucleation at multiple sites due to the increased CP results in local variation of polymeriza - tion conditions . Overall , we observed CP - dependent radial patterns of the barbed end density that we relate to the geometry of the observed actin domains in vesicles , considering that network growth velocities directly depend on the barbed end density 17 . CP overexpression induces vesicle formation in B16 - F1 cells . Finally , we tested the capability of CP to induce membrane deformations in cells . To this end we overexpressed heterodimeric CP in the widely used B16 - F1 mouse melanoma cells using a doxycycline - inducible expression system .

Ectopically expressed CP accumulated at the leading edge , and consistent with previous work reporting on the explosive increase of ﬁ lopodia in CP - depleted B16 - F1 cells 29 , we found that the formation of micro - spikes was largely inhibited in the strong CP overexpressors , as opposed to the numerous microspikes in the lamellipodia of untransfected control cells ( Fig . 6a , b ) . As expected the thickness of the lamellipodium also decreased from 1 . 7 to 0 . 7 µm in cells overexpressing CP ( Fig . 6c ) . Most importantly , however , the cells strongly overexpressing CP exhibited a substantial increase of actin - containing vesicles by about 50 % ( Fig . 6d ) . However , since neither the endosomal marker Rab7 , nor the lysosomal marker LAMP1 or the ﬂ uid - phase marker TRITC dextrane was found to colocalize with the majority of these CP - containing vesicles , we could exclude the possibility that the formed vesicles were regular endosomes , lysosomes or vesicular structures entrapped by micropinocytosis ( Supplementary Figure 13 ) . Our observations therefore clearly corroborate the view that an increase of CP concentration is already suf ﬁ cient to induce and shift membrane deformations from concave to convex in vivo , but further implies that overexpression of CP alone without upregulation of the other components of the machinery and appropriate signalling is not suf ﬁ cient to increase the number of endocytic vesicles .

After polymerization start the available Arp2 / 3 complex reservoir must equilibrate towards a new steady - state concentration as the regeneration rate is slow . The balance between branching by Arp2 / 3 complex and capping by CP determines the ﬁ nal network mechanics leading two the observed shape deformations of the membrane . b Network growth can be observed by modelling the temporal evolution of barbed ends . Four different growth regimes occur . The seeding phase , where ﬁ rst barbed ends are formed , is followed by an initial rapid growth . Finally the barbed ends level off to a steady - state by passing a transient phase . The growth processes depend on the concentration of CP . c – e The temporal evolution of barbed ends ( c ) , activated Arp2 / 3 complex ( Arp2 / 3 * ) ( d ) , branching and capping events ( e ) at in ﬁ nite protein pools is shown . The ﬁ nal steady - state of barbed end density and Arp2 / 3 * was set by CP concentration . The balance between branching and capping events controlled the equilibration process of network growth towards the steady state . f The spatio - temporal network growth was modelled along the membrane at ﬁ nite protein pools . Two distinct barbed end patterns emerged . At 40 and 120 nM CP a ﬂ at barbed end distribution was observed and at 80 nM a double - peaked density distribution occurred NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 03918 - 1 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 1630 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 03918 - 1 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 7 within networks formed by Arp2 / 3 complex , which induce either positively or negatively curved membrane deformations . Low CP concentrations ensure fast network nucleation and growth at the membrane , which results in the formation of homogeneous cortices . Higher CP concentrations slow down nucleation ef ﬁ - ciency of the network such that a few nucleation sites appear at the membrane and the ﬁ nite actin pool is partitioned between those . Distinct actin domains form at the membrane , which ultimately induce shape deformations in the membrane . High CP concentrations slow down network extension , thus over time slow and con ﬁ ned growing domains emerge at the membrane until they are densely packed to form closed cortices . This balance between nucleation and growth speed ﬁ nally leads to the observed appearance of volume spanning networks at the highest CP concentrations studied here ( 180 nM ) . The temporal resolved TIRF - measurements of domain growth on a lipid monolayer dependent on the CP concentration con ﬁ rm that Arp2 / 3 induced nucleation and domain growth correlate with the CP con - centration . Confocal measurement of the distribution of ﬂ uor - escent VCA at the vesicle ’ s membrane identi ﬁ ed an up - concentration of the Arp2 / 3 activator during polymerization , which is in agreement with experimental and theoretical work 1 , 10 . By kinetic simulations we identi ﬁ ed that the out of equilibrium nature of the reaction kinetics of actin and its binding proteins are responsible for the observed deformations . The coupled kinetic equations result in two distinct non - uniform poly - merization patterns leading to inhomogeneous barbed end den - sity pro ﬁ les . These can be directly linked to different protrusion velocities of the growing networks based on a ratchet model for membrane protrusions 39 . Compared to in vivo and most in vitro studies ( that use a ~ 100 - fold VCA density 14 , 15 ) , the number of barbed ends in our model system is low ( < = 450 / µm 2 ) and therefore we assume that protrusion velocities are not dominated by monomer depletion , but rather by membrane tension 17 , 40 . In this regime the load per ﬁ lament decreases with increasing net - work density . Consequently , the protrusion velocity increases exponentially with an increasing number of barbed ends 17 . For low CP concentrations the number of barbed ends is constant along the membrane . Therefore , the network grows homo - geneously and an actin protrusion is formed . For higher CP concentrations the number of barbed ends is lower in the domain centre than at the domain edges . Thus , the network protrusion is faster at the domain edges and slower in the domain centre . A concave actin domain is formed . Although the kinetic simulations are able to rationalize the emerging structures , it remains a major challenge to combine the kinetic simulations with mechanical responses of the complete system . Our experiments further reveal that CP is an important reg - ulator of the network structures in cells . While upregulation of CP leads to an increased formation of actin - containing vesicles , decrease of lamellipodium width and the inhibition ﬁ lopodia formation , a down regulation was previously shown to result in an explosive increase of ﬁ lopodia and complete suppression of lamellipodia formation 17 . The strong interdependence of the network structures results from a homeostasis effect of the actin cytoskeleton structures in cells , as ﬁ rst demonstrated to be an CP Dox CP no Dox no CP Dox N V e s i c l e s / c e l l 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 d Actin CP Composite C P D o x C P no D o x no C P D o x a CP Dox CP no Dox no CP Dox N M i c r o s p i k e 0 5 20 10 15 b CP Dox CP no Dox no CP Dox 1 0 . 5 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 T h i ck ne ss ( μ m ) c Fig . 6 CP affects membrane deformations in vivo . a The distribution of phalloidin stained F - actin ( red ) and of CP visualized by HA - Tag antibody labelling ( green ) in ﬁ xed cells is shown : In the top cells overexpressed CP after induction with 1 µ g / ml Doxycyclin ( CP Dox , N = 21 ) .

In this case , the lim - ited actin monomer pool is split between the different actin structures , depending on the activation of the nucleation factors Arp2 / 3 complex and formin . In our experiments the growth - induced network stresses alone were not suf ﬁ cient to induce ﬁ ssion of the invaginations from the membrane in the in vitro system . By the addition of NMM II membrane ﬁ ssion events are induced in a CP - dependent manner and endocytic - type vesicles were formed in the in vitro system . The requirement of myosins is in accordance with observations in vivo 43 – 46 . Further studies are needed to shed light on the dynamics and physical mechanisms behind membrane ﬁ ssion events . To conclude , we demonstrated that the growth conditions of branched actin networks are decisive for ful ﬁ lling their multiple tasks . CP controls in a concentration - dependent manner of the microscopic assembly kinetics , which in turn alters the mechan - ical properties of the growing network suf ﬁ ciently to induce either negative or positive curvatures to the actin network and the attached vesicle membrane . A detailed ﬁ nite - element analysis of the CP - dependent growth patterns is required to fully link microscopic actin assembly to mesoscopic membrane deforma - tions . In cells the CP regulatory protein CARMIL and V - 1 were identi ﬁ ed to tightly control the amount of available CP 47 – 49 , which could be decisive for cells to switch between the diverging demands of function . It is the balance between the presence of nucleation factors and CPs , which sets the ﬁ nal function of cytoskeletal structures via the assembly kinetics . This underlines the urgent need to understand the full reaction kinetics in net - works beyond the steady - state conditions . Methods Protein puri ﬁ cation . G - actin was puri ﬁ ed from rabbit skeletal muscle by a modi ﬁ ed protocol of Spudich et al . 50 . It was stored at 4°C in G - Buffer ( 2 mM Tris , 0 . 2mM ATP , 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT and 0 . 005 % NaN 3 , pH 8 . 0 ) . G - actin was labelled with Atto 488 NHS - ester ( Jena Bioscience ) 51 at cysteine 374 or with N - ( 1 - pyrenyl ) iodoacetamide to perform pyrene assays 52 . Arp2 / 3 complex was extracted from pig brain and puri ﬁ ed as described previously 53 . It was ﬂ uorescently labelled by adding a 3 - fold excess of maleimide Atto 647N dye ( Atto - Tec ) and incubated while rotating for 2h at − 4 °C . Finally , the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1mM DTT and the excess dye was removed by a NAP size - exclusion chromato - graphy column ( NAP - 25 Columns , GE Healthcare ) . The C - terminal domain ( VCA ) of murine N - WASP was expressed in BL21 Codon Plus DE3 - RIPL ( Agilent Technologies ) as a His - tagged protein overnight in LB medium . After puri ﬁ cation by Ni - NTA af ﬁ nity chromatography in SoniBuffer ( 50 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 50mM NaH 2 PO 4 ·2H 2 O , 300 mM NaCl , pH 8 . 0 ) , the protein was dialysed against storage buffer ( 20 mM Tris / HCl , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM EGTA , 2mM DTT , pH 7 . 0 ) and stored at − 80°C . We kept the histidine - tag to enable the binding of VCA to Ni - NTA lipids . VCA was labelled by the addition of a 3 - fold excess of maleimide dye Atto 647N ( Atto - Tec ) and incubated for 2 h at 4°C . Afterwards it was quenched by 1 mM DTT and the excess dye was removed by size - exclusion chromatography using a NAP - 25 column ( GE Healthcare ) . Pro ﬁ lin ( mPfn2a ) was expressed in BL21 Codon Plus DE3 - RIPL ( Agilent Technologies ) as a glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion protein . After its puri ﬁ cation it was dialysed against 20 mM Tris ( pH 7 ) , 150mM NaCl , 1mM DTT and stored at 4°C 54 . The GST - tag was removed by proteolytic cleavage after puri ﬁ cation . The mouse α 1 - and β 2 - subunits of CP 55 cloned into pRSFDuet ™ - 1 ( Novagen ) were expressed in BL21 Codon Plus DE3 - RIPL ( Agilent Technologies ) and puri ﬁ ed using ﬂ ag - tag af ﬁ nity chromato - graphy . The cells were grown at 37 °C until the A 600nm of 0 . 6 was reached . The expression was induced by the addition of 0 . 5mM IPTG and shaking was con - tinued overnight . The cells were collected and resuspended in 20 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 250 mM NaCl , 1mM EDTA , 5 % glycerol . After centrifugation ( 30 , 000r . p . m . , 10 min , 4°C ) supernatant was mixed with 100 µl ANTI - FLAG M2 Af ﬁ nity Gel ( Sigma Aldrich ) per 100 ml supernatant , rotated for 90min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at low speed ( 500 r . p . m . ) . Beads were washed several times with the same buffer before adding 100µl FLAG Peptide ( Sigma Aldrich F3290 - 25mg lyophilized powder ) per 1ml buffer . After a 1 h incubation on a rotating wheel at 4°C they were centrifuged for 2min at 14 , 000 r . p . m . Supernatant with CP was dialysed against 10 mM Tris / HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 50mM KCl , 1 mM DTT overnight then ﬂ ash - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80°C . NMM II was puri ﬁ ed from human blood platelets and stored at − 20 °C in 60 % sucrose following a standard protocol 56 . Encapsulation . The encapsulated protein solutions were mixed on ice directly before vesicle production . Here 3 µM G - actin , 300 nM VCA , 300 nM Arp2 / 3 complex , 13 . 5µM pro ﬁ lin and the desired amount of CP were added to the polymerization buffer ( 10 mM imidazole , 3mM MgCl 2 , 30 mM KCl , 1mM EGTA , pH 7 . 4 ) . We replaced 10 % of unlabelled G - actin by covalently labelled Atto 488 actin to mark the network structures ﬂ uorescently . To measure the contractile behaviour dependent on CP , 5µM non - muscle myosin II were added additionally to the encapsulation mix . In all experiments the amount of all protein buffers was kept constant . Only 300 nM VCA ( 25 % were labelled with Atto 647N ) were encapsulated in the absence of any other proteins to study effects of VCA clustering on domain formation . To study VCA induced Arp2 / 3 clustering , we encapsulated 300 nM of Arp2 / 3 ( 35 % were labelled with Atto 647N ) additional to 300 nM VCA . The osmotic pressure of the outside solution , which was prepared of 1 M glucose , was adapted 10 to 20 mosmol higher compared to the encapsulated solution . A total concentration of 0 . 5 mM lipids were dissolved in a mixture of 14 % mineral oil ( Sigma Aldrich , M3516 ) , 80 % silicone oil ( Roth , 4020 . 1 ) and 6 % decane ( Sigma Adlrich , D901 ) as previously described 37 . The ﬁ nal lipid oil mixture contained 87 . 4 % Egg - PC ( Sigma Aldrich , P3556 ) , which was dissolved at 50mg / ml in a chloroform / methanol mixture ( 9 : 1 , v / v ) , 10 % Ni - NTA ( Avanti Lipids , 790404 C ) and 2 . 5 % PEG2000 PE ( Avanti , Lipids , 880160C ) . To label the membrane 0 . 06 % of the ﬂ uorescent lipid Texas Red ( Thermo Fischer , T1395MP ) was added to the lipid mix . Vesicles were produced for 5min at 5 °C using a slightly modi ﬁ ed protocol of the recently published cDICE encapsulation method 38 . We used capillaries with a diameter of 40µm to prevent protein clogging and adapted the speed of rotation to 1200 r . p . m . The capillary was injected in a solution containing 70 % decane and 30 % mineral oil . The vesicles were imaged 30min after production and remained stable for several hours . All reported experiments we performed at least twice with different preparations of proteins . Quality of protein charges were determined by bulk assays . Pyrene assays . The polymerization kinetics of the encapsulated protein mixtures were measured by pyrene assays . To this end 20 % of the unlabelled G - actin were replaced by pyrenyl actin . The measurements were carried out with the microplate reader SpectraMax M5 ( Molecular Devices ) . Imaging and data acquisition . Bright - ﬁ eld and epi ﬂ uorescence images of the vesicles were taken by a ×63 numerical aperture ( NA ) 1 . 3 oil immersion objective on a commercially built Leica Microscope DMI3000 B in combination with a Hamamatsu ORCA - ER camera . Confocal images were taken by a ×63 NA 1 . 4 oil immersion objective with on a Leica TSC SP5 . The temporal evolution was observed by acquiring 3D stacks of epi ﬂ uorescence snapshots with a ×100 NA 1 . 4 oil immersion objective or a ×40 NA ( 1 . 25 – 0 . 75 ) oil immersion objective on a commercially built Leica Microscope DMI3000 B . The 3D image acquisition was started one minute after ﬁ nishing the encapsulation process . We acquired snap - shots of the 3D epi ﬂ uorescence stacks of the vesicles every three minutes in order to avoid any artefacts by phototoxicity . Imaging of ﬁ xed cells was performed with an LSM510Meta confocal microscope ( Zeiss ) equipped with a ×63 / 1 . 3 Plan - Neo ﬂ uar objective using the 488nm and 543 nm laser lines . Confocal and ﬂ uorescent images were used to measure the domain length and curvature by ImageJ . Actin domains at the membrane were counted with the 3D object counter provided by ImageJ . Vector construction . For the expression of human heterodimeric CP the bicis - tronic IRES Tet - On 3G inducible expression system ( Clontech ) was employed . pTRE3G - IRES is a Tet - inducible , bicistronic mammalian expression vector designed to coexpress two genes of interest under the control of the Tet - responsive promoter pTRE3 . pCMV - Tet3G expresses Tet - On 3G , a tetracycline - controlled transactivator that exhibits high activity in the presence of the inducer doxycycline . To generate pTRE3G - IRES - HA - CP α 1 , the corresponding sequence was ampli ﬁ ed by PCR from cDNA as a MluI - BamHI fragment using the primers 5 ′ - CGCACGCGTATGTATCCTTACGACGTGCCTGACTACGCCATGGCC - GACTTCGATGATCGTGTG - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - GAGGGATCCTTAAGCATTCTG - CATTTCTTTGCC - 3 ′ and inserted into the same sites of the second multiple cloning site ( MCS2 ) of pTRE3G - IRES . The longer upstream primer contained additional sequences to allow expression of the α 1 subunit with an N - terminal HA epitope ( aa YPYDVPDYA ) for later immunostaining . The corresponding sequence encoding the β 2 subunit was ampli ﬁ ed by PCR as a SalI - EagI fragment using the primers 5 ′ - CGCGTCGACATGAGTGATCAGCAGCTGGAC - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - GAGCGGCCGTTAGCATTGCTGCTTTCTCTTC - 3 ′ and inserted into the same sites of MCS1 in pTRE3G - IRES - HA - CP α 1 yielding pTRE3G - IRES - HA - CP α 1 / CP β 2 . All sequences were veri ﬁ ed by DNA sequencing . Cell culture and transfections . B16 - F1 mouse melanoma cells ( ATCC CRL - 6323 ) were grown in DMEM with 4 . 5 g / l glucose ( Lonza ) supplemented with 10 % FCS ( Biowest ) , 2 mM UltraGlutamine ( Lonza ) and 1 % of a 100× penicillin / strepto - mycin stock solution ( Biowest ) at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . Absence of mycoplasma was routinely checked by the VenorGeM Mycoplasma Detection Kit ( Sigma ) . Trans - fections were carried out with JetPrime ( Polyplus ) , according to the manufacturers ’ NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 03918 - 1 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 1630 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 03918 - 1 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 9 protocols at a 4 : 1 ratio of pTRE3G - IRES - HA - CP α 1 / CPß2 and pCMV - Tet3G . Prior to transfection the cells were seeded on glass coverslips coated with 25 µg / ml laminin ( Sigma ) overnight . Induction of CP overexpression was induced by addition of 1 µg / ml of Doxycyclin ( Clontech ) 4h after the transfection . Fixation , labelling and analyses of cells . After 24 h of induction , the cells were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min , extracted with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 1min and stained with ﬂ uorescent phalloidin to visualize ﬁ la - mentous actin and with anti - HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 ( undiluted hybri - doma supernatant ) , which is a subclone of H26DO 57 , to visualize the HA epitope . Atto550 - phalloidin ( 1 : 200 dilution , # AD 550 - 81 ; Atto - Tec ) was used to stain F - actin and secondary goat - anti - mouse Alexa488 - labelled antibodies ( 1 : 1 , 000 dilu - tion ; # A32723 ) were from Thermo Fisher . Anti - Rab7 antibody ( 1 : 200 dilution ; # 9367 ) was from Cell Signalling , anti - LAMP1 antibody ( 1 : 200 ; # ab24170 ) was from Abcam , and lysine - ﬁ xable TRITC dextrane ( 1mg / ml ; 70 , 000 MW , # D1818 ) was from Thermo Fisher . For immunohistochemistry , secondary Alexa - 555 - conjugated goat - anti - rabbit polyclonal antibodies ( 1 : 1 , 000 dilution ; # A21429 ; Invitrogen ) were used . Immunoblotting was performed according to standard protocols using undiluted hybridoma supernatant of anti - HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 , anti - CP - beta monoclonal antibody ( 1 : 200 ; # sc - 136502 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , and anti - GAPDH monoclonal antibody ( 1 : 1000 ; # 6C5 ; Calbiochem ) . Primary anti - bodies in immunoblots were visualized with phosphatase - coupled anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 1 , 000 , # 115 - 055 - 62 ; Dianova ) . Lamellipodium thickness was determined by ImageJ . The phalloidin ﬂ uorescence intensity in lamellipodia was measured at four different positions to calculate the full width half maximum for two independent experiments ( n = 2 ) .
