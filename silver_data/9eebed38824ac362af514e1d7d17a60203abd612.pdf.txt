Multiple studies have looked at the effect of nonpharmaceutical interventions for preventing SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in traditional summer camp settings , but none in the medical summer camp setting . Our objective was to describe and evaluate the nonpharmaceutical interventions on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission rate in a medical summer camp setting . Methods : This was a single institution cross sectional study conducted between June 2021 and August 2021 in a rural summer camp setting in upstate New York . Nonpharmaceutical interventions consisted of prearrival guidance on low - risk activities , obtaining negative SARS - CoV - 2 PCR within 72 h prior to arrival , adult SARS - CoV - 2 vaccine mandate , universal masking mandate , small cohorts , daily symptom screening , and rapid testing on site . Primary cases were defined as an individual with a positive SARS - CoV - 2 test of any type while at camp or 2 wk after departure from camp without any known exposure at camp ; secondary cases were defined as cases from potential exposures within camp . Results : Two hundred and ninety - three campers were included . Nine individuals were tested due to potentially infectious symptoms while at camp . Thirty - four campers were tested due to arriving from a county with an a priori intermediate SARS - CoV - 2 community spread . Zero on - site rapid tests were positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . Conclusions : We describe the implementation of multilayered nonpharmaceutical interventions at a medical summer camp during the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic . Keywords : COVID - 19 , nonpharmaceutical interventions , risk mitigation , public health J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 Introduction 1 2 Advances in medical diagnostics and therapeutics have resulted in more children living with 3 chronic medical conditions . 1 While mortality for these individuals has decreased , the 4 psychosocial morbidity such as anxiety , depressionm and self - esteem disturbances have 5 increased . 2 SARS - CoV - 2 , the microbe responsible for COVID - 19 , has had significant 6 ramifications on the lives of children since 2019 . 3 Children have been exposed to loss of loved 7 ones , household financial hardship , food insecurity , asynchronous education , restrictions of in - 8 person interactions , and gaps in typical psychosocial outlets resulting in negative health 9 outcomes . 4 - 7 Summer camps foster the development of social skills , team work , problem solving , 10 and self - identity . 8 , 9 Medically complex children often cannot participate in traditional summer 11 camps and therefore are not provided the opportunity to develop such skills . Medically complex 12 children do , however , have the opportunity to attend medical summer camps where they learn 13 the same life - long skills as traditional summer camp in addition to learning different coping 14 mechanisms , management of their own illness , and altruism . 10 - 14 Therefore , the pandemic has the 15 potential for greater negative biopsychosocial ramifications in the medically complex 16 child . 11 , 15 , 16 17 18 Multiple studies have described the range of nonpharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) 19 implemented in traditional summer camp settings . These NPIs have been used to mitigate the 20 transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 with varying degrees of success . 17 - 22 To our knowledge , none of 21 these studies have evaluated the role of NPIs in a medical summer camp setting . The objective of 22 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 this study is to describe the demographics , NPIs , and transmission patterns of SARS - CoV - 2 23 among staff and medically complex children while attending a medical summer camp . 24 25 Methods 26 27 Study design : This is a single institution cross - sectional study conducted between June 2021 and 28 August 2021 in a rural summer camp setting in upstate New York . The study was conducted at a 29 residential medical summer camp with approximately 50 - 60 campers per session with 6 sessions 30 of 5 d duration . The study was determined to be exempt for review by the Albany Medical 31 Center institutional review board and therefore consent was not required . All enrolled campers 32 were included . No one was excluded from the study . Data were entered directly into a Research 33 Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ) tool hosted at Albany Medical Center . Individual level 34 demographic data ( ie , age , gender , and county of residence ) and medical data ( ie , past medical 35 history , SARS - CoV - 2 vaccination status , and SARS - CoV - 2 infection history ) was gathered from 36 the self - reported application . All “prearrival” SARS - CoV - 2 PCR test and “during session” 37 SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acid amplification tests ( NAAT ) and their results were gathered on an 38 encrypted central camp database . 39 40 Nonpharmaceutical interventions 41 42 Pre - arrival screening : 43 44 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 Seventy - two hours prior to the first day of a camp session , the medical team assessed the 45 level of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission within the 11 counties surrounding camp . An a priori 46 definition of risk included low risk , intermediate risk , and high risk ( Figure 1 ) . 47 48 If community risk was low , prearrival mitigation strategies and in session mitigation 49 strategies were implemented as described below . If community risk was intermediate , the 50 same mitigation steps as low risk were implemented in addition to performing rapid 51 SARS - CoV - 2 NAAT upon arrival to camp for all individuals coming from counties with 52 non - low – risk community infectivity . If community risk was high , the camp did not open 53 for that session . 54 55 Mitigation steps : 56 57 Prearrival mitigation steps included a prearrival screening phone call and prearrival 58 SARS - CoV - 2 testing . Screening phone calls were performed by the medical staff calling 59 the camper’s family 2 wk prior to arrival to evaluate travel / exposure history . The medical 60 staff also informed the family that the household should quarantine until arrival to 61 camp . Prearrival testing involved all campers providing documentation of a negative 62 SARS - CoV - 2 PCR from within 72 h prior to arrival on site . 63 64 In - session mitigation steps : 65 Staff vaccination mandate : All staff and volunteers were required to be fully 66 vaccinated against SARS - CoV - 2 2 wk prior to arrival on site . 67 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 68 Daily symptom screening : Every morning prior to leaving their cabin , all staff 69 members and campers underwent a standardized symptoms screen by medical 70 staff ( Pinpoint SARS - CoV - 2 screening , Wellcheck . Monkton , MD ) . If an 71 individual reported any symptom , they were evaluated by the camp physician . 72 73 Cohorting : On site cohorts were made up of 10 campers and 5 - 7 staff members . 74 75 Universal masking : Masks were worn by all campers / staff unless the only people 76 present were within the on - site cohort , they were eating / drinking , participating in 77 an aquatic activity , or they were sleeping . 78 79 Intentional staffing pattern : Activity areas that required specific 80 training / certifications had dedicated staff assigned to that area and were counted 81 within an on - site cohort . This allowed for small cohorts without a lot of “cross 82 contamination” within a program area by program staff . 83 84 Intentional common space utilization to allow for social distancing : Each on - site 85 cohort had a designated indoor and outdoor dining area as to physically distance 86 every cabin from one another while all masks were down during mealtime . 87 88 Specific person under investigation protocols : Any potentially infectious 89 complaint was evaluated in an infirmary physically separate from the 90 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 noninfectious infirmary . Any infectious complaint had a rapid SARS - CoV - 2 91 NAAT performed on site . If negative , they could return to camp activities per 92 standard medical policies . If positive , the whole cabin cohort was sent home . 93 94 Statistical analysis 95 96 Descriptive analysis was used to describe camper demographics , index cases , primary 97 cases , secondary cases , primary attack rate , and secondary attack rate . Index cases were 98 defined as an individual with a positive SARS - CoV - 2 test of any type while at camp or 2 99 wk after departure from camp without any known exposure at camp ; primary cases were 100 defined as cases from potential exposures while at camp . Secondary cases were defined 101 as cases from potential exposures to primary cases . A contact was defined as any 102 individual who had close contact ( less than 2 m [ 6 ft ] for 15 min or more within a 24 h 103 period ) with a primary case with or without masks while at camp . Primary attack rate and 104 secondary transmission rate were calculated according to previous studies . 18 Primary 105 attack rate was calculated as the number of new primary cases during the camp session of 106 infection divided by the number of campers on - site during the session of infection . 107 Secondary transmission rate was calculated as the number of secondary cases among 108 contacts of index cases . Chronic medical conditions were defined as any medical 109 condition expected to last > 12 mo and require the care of a specialist provider . 110 111 112 Results 113 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 114 The study cohort consisted of 499 total individuals , with 242 of those being campers . The mean 115 age of campers was 12 y . As seen in Table 1 , 168 ( 69 % ) were from the state of NY , with 27 % of 116 those campers being from the Capital District region of NY ( comprised of Albany , Columbia , 117 Fulton , Greene , Montgomery , Rensselaer , Saratoga , Schenectady , Schoharie , Warren , and 118 Washington counties ) . Of the 242 campers , 192 ( 79 % ) of campers had a chronic medical 119 condition ; the most common being sickle cell disease ( 22 % ) , bleeding / clotting disorders ( 13 % ) , 120 cerebral palsy ( 10 % ) , and epilepsy ( 6 % ) . Of the 242 campers , 87 were vaccinated ( 36 % ) . All 121 eligible campers were vaccinated with Pfizer Biontec mRNA vaccine since this was the only 122 SARS - CoV - 2 vaccine that had FDA emergency use approval in patients < 18 y old at the time of 123 the study . Two - hundred thirty - nine campers ( 99 % ) had a negative SARS - CoV - 2 PCR test prior 124 to arrival at camp . 125 126 A total of 232 infirmary visits were logged , a combination of both staff , volunteers , and campers . 127 Thirty - eight total SARS - CoV - 2 tests were performed during the study period , with 4 resulting 128 from symptomatic testing and 34 resulting from asymptomatic screening in persons coming from 129 counties with intermediate risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Overall , there were no positive 130 SARS - CoV - 2 tests while persons were on site or for 2 wk after their departure from camp . There 131 were no index , primary , or secondary cases of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . No sessions were 132 cancelled due to high community spread . 133 134 Discussion 135 136 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 No transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 was observed within this residential summer camp over 60 d . 137 This is the first study to our knowledge that evaluates the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 within a 138 residential summer camp for medically complex children . Our findings correspond with previous 139 studies that show low transmission rates when a multilayered mitigation approach to infection 140 control is implemented . 17 - 22 Similarly , our findings are consistent with studies showing low 141 transmission rates within schools that have a multilayered mitigation approach to infection 142 control . 23 - 26 Our findings are contrasted by studies which show high transmission rates within 143 residential summer camp communities without a multi - layered mitigation approach to infection 144 control . 27 145 146 Limitations of our study include a small sample size of 242 campers . This study was limited to 147 only one medical summer camp in one isolated geographic region of the United States . Each 148 camper was only on site for 5 d . This study was conducted during a period when Alpha and 149 Delta variants of SARS - CoV - 2 were the most prevalent variants . The lower transmissibility of 150 these variants compared to other variants , such as Omicron , pose a potential limitation to the 151 generalizability of this study . Lastly , this study took place during a period with low community 152 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission rates ( 28 cases / 100K 7 d average in New York State over the 60 d 153 study period ) . 154 155 Conclusions 156 157 In this study , we describe the implementation of a multilayered mitigation approach to infection 158 control in a medically complex summer camp population . Future research should focus on 159 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 evaluating the effectiveness of such measures in broader geographic locations , times of higher 160 community SARS - CoV - 2 transmission rates , in times of differing variants of concern , and in 161 populations of varying chronic medical conditions . 162 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 Acknowledgments : Erik Reidel , MD J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 Author contributions : Study concept and design ( KW , SN , AA , CW ) ; data acquisition ( KW , SN , AA , CW ) ; data analysis ( KW , SN , AA , CW ) ; drafting and critical revision of the manuscript ( KW , SN , AA , CW ) ; approval of final manuscript ( KW , SN , AA , CW ) .
