ON THE EVOLUTION OF RANDOM GRAPHS by P . ERDŐS and A . RÉNYI Dedicated to Professor P . Turán at his 50th birthday . Introduction Our aim is to study the probable structure of a random graph rn N which has n given labelled vertices P , P2 , . . . , Pn and N edges ; we suppose that these N edges are chosen at random among the l n 1 possible edges , 2 so that all ~ 2 = Cn , n possible choices are supposed to be equiprobable . Thus 1V if G , , , , , denotes any one of the C , , N graphs formed from n given labelled points and having N edges , the probability that the random graph - Pn , N is identical with G , , , N is 1 . If A is a property which a graph may or may not possess , Cn , N we denote by P n N ( A ) the probability that the random graph T . , N possesses the property A , i . e . we put Pn , N ( A ) = An ' N where An , N denotes the Cn N number of those Gn , N which have the property A . An other equivalent formulation is the following : Let us suppose that n labelled vertices P , , P2 , . . . , Pn are given . Let us choose at random an edge among the l n I possible edges , so that all these edges are equiprobable . After 2 this let us choose an other edge among the remaining I n - 1 edges , and continue this process so that if already k edges are fixed , any of the remaining ( n ) - k edges have equal probabilities to be chosen as the next one . We shall 2study the " evolution " of such a random graph if N is increased . In this investi - gation we endeavour to find what is the " typical " structure at a given stage of evolution ( i . e . if N is equal , or asymptotically equal , to a given function N ( n ) of n ) . By a " typical " structure we mean such a structure the probability of which tends to 1 if n - * + - when N = N ( n ) . If A is such a property that lim Pn , N , ( n ) ( A ) = 1 , we shall say that „almost all " graphs Gn , N ( n ) n - - - possess this property . 17 2 A Matematikai Kutató Intézet Közleménye ! V . A / 1 - 2 . 18 The study of the evolution of graphs leads to rather surprising results . For a number of fundamental structural properties A there exists a function A ( n ) tending monotonically to + - for n - i - - such that ( 1 ) ( 2 ) such that ( 3 ) lim Pn , N ( n ) ( A ) n - . - ( 4 ) lim Pn , N ( n ) ( A ) _ n - + - Clearly ( 3 ) implies that lim Pn , N ( n ) ( A ) _ n - . - i ERDŐS - RÉNYi i jr t ( x ) _ 1 0 if lim X ( v ) = 0 n - A ( n ) if lim N ( n ) _ _ + co . n - A ( n ) If such a function A ( n ) exists we shall call it a " threshold function " of the property A . In many cases besides ( 1 ) it is also true that there exists a probability distribution function F ( x ) so that if 0 < x < + - and x is a point of conti - nuity of F ( x ) then lim n ) = x . n - • + m n - > - A ( n ) If ( 2 ) holds we shall say that A ( n ) is a „regular threshold function " for the property A and call the function F ( x ) the threshold distribution function of the property A . For certain properties A there exist two functions A , ( n ) and A 2 ( n ) both tending monotonically to + - for n - - > - + - , and satisfying lim Á2 ( n ) = 0 , n - - Al ( n ) " M Pn , N ( n ) ( A ) - F ( x ) i f if lim ( n ) - A , ( n ) _ - n - + - A2 ( n ) if lim N ( n ) - Al ( n ) _ + 00 . n - - + a A2 ( n ) 0 if lim sup N ( n ) < 1 n - a + m Al ( n ) ~ ' 1 if liro inf + ( n ) > 1 . n - + ro A , . ( n ) If ( 3 ) holds we call the pair ( Al ( n ) , A2 ( n ) ) a pair of °sharp threshold " - functions of the property A . It follows from ( 4 ) that if ( Aj ( n ) , A2 ( n ) ) is a pair of sharp threshold functions for the property A then A , ( n ) is an ( ordinary ) threshold function for the property A and the threshold distribution function figuring in ( 2 ) is the degenerated distribution function ( 1 for x < 1 for x > 1 and convergence in ( 2 ) takes place for every x 1 . In some cases besides ( 3 ) it is also true that there exists a probability distribution function G ( y ) defined for - - < y < - ) - - such that if y is a point of continuity of G ( y ) then ( ő ) lim Pn . N ( n ) ( A ) = G ( y ) n - ON THE EVOLUTION OF RANDOM GRAPHS if lím NT ( n ) - A , ( n ) = y n - - x A ( n ) 1 9 if ( ő ) holds we shall say that we have a regular sharp threshold and shall call G ( y ) the sharp - threshold distribution function of the property A . One of our chief aims will be to determine the threshold respectively sharp threshold functions , and the corresponding distribution functions for the most obvious structural properties , e . g . the presence in rn N of subgraphs of a given type ( trees , cycles of given order , complete subgraphs etc . ) further for certain global properties of the graph ( connectedness , total number of connected components , etc . ) . In a previous paper [ 7 ] we have considered a special problem of this type ; we have shown that denoting by C the property that the graph is con - nected , the pair C , ( n ) - 1 n log n . C2 ( n ) = n is a pair of strong threshold 2 functions for the property C , and the corresponding sharp - threshold distri - bution function is e - 2v ; thus we have proved ' that putting AT A ( 12 ) = 1a n log n + y n + o ( n . ) we have ( Ó ) lim PnMn ) ( C ) = e _ e 2Y ( - - < y < + - ) n - - In the present paper we consider the evolution of a random graph in a more systematicc manner and try to describe the gradual development and step - by - step unravelling of the complex structure of the graph F . , N when N increases while n is a given large number . We succeeded in revealing the emergence of certain structural properties of - V N . However a great deal remains to be done in this field . We shall call in § 10 . the attention of the reader to certain unsolved problems . It seems to us further that it would be worth while to consider besides graphs also more complex structures from the same point of view , i . e . to investigate the laws governing their evolution in a similar spirit . This may be interesting not only from a purely mathematical point of view . In fact , the evolution of graphs may be considered as a rather simplified model of the evolution of certain communication nets ( railway , road or electric network systems , etc . ) of a country or some other unit . ( Of course , if one aims at describing such a real situation , one should replace the hypothesis of equiprobability of all connections by some more realistic hypothesis . ) It seems plausible that by considering the random growth of more complicated structures ( e . g . structures consisting of different sorts of " points " and connections of different types ) one could obtain fairly reasonable models of more complex real growth processes ( e . g . i Partial result on this problem has been obtained already in 1939 by P . ERDős and 11 . WH ITNEY but their results have not been published . 2 * 20 ERDÖS - RÉNYI the growth of a complex communication net consisting of different types of connections , and even of organic structures of living matter , etc . ) . § § 1 - 3 . contain the discussion of the presence of certain components in a random graph , while § § 4 - 9 . investigate certain global properties of a random graph . Most of our investigations deal with the case when N ( n ) - enn with c > 0 . In fact our results give a clear picture of the evolution of r n N ( n ) when c = N ( n ) ( which plays in a certain sense the role of time ) increases . n In § 10 . we make some further remarks and mention some unsolved problems . Our investigation belongs to the combinatorical theory of graphs , which has a fairly large literature . The first who enumerated the number of possible graphs with a given structure was A . CaYLEY [ 1 ] . Next the impor - tant paper [ 2 ] of G . PÓLYA has to be mentioned , the starting point of which were some chemical problems . Among more recent results we mention the papers of G . E . UHLENBEcK and G . W . FORD [ 5 ] and E . N . GILBERT [ G ] . A fairly complete bibliography will be given in a paper of F . HaRARY [ 8 ] . In these papers the probabilistic point of view was not explicitly emphasized . This has been done in the paper [ 9 ] of one of the authors , but the aim of the probabilistic treatment was there different : the existence of certain types of graphs has been shown by proving that their probability is positive . Random trees have been considered in [ 14 ] . In a recent paper [ 10 ] T . L . AusTIN , R . E . FAGEN , W . F . PENNEY and J . RioRDAN deal with random graphs from a point of view similar to ours . The difference between the definition of a random graph in [ 10 ] and in the present paper consists in that in [ 10 ] it is admitted that two points should be connected by more than one edge ( " parallel " edges ) . Thus in [ 10 ] it is supposed that after a certain number of edges have already been selected , the next edge to be selected may be any of the possible l n 1 edges between 2 the n given points ( including the edges already selected ) . Let us denote such a random graph by I n N . The difference between the probable properties of r n N resp , rn , N are in most ( but not in all ) cases negligible . The correspond - ing probabilities are in general ( if the number N of edges is not too large ) asymptotically equal . There is a third possible point of view which is in most cases almost equivalent with these two ; we may suppose that for each pair of n given points it is determined by a chance process whether the edge connecting the two points should be selected or not , the probability for select - ing any given edge being equal to the same number p > 0 , and the decisions concerning the different edges being completely independent . In this case of course the number of edges is a random variable , haying the expectation ( nl p ; thus if we want to obtain by this method a random graph having in 2 the mean N edges we have to choose the value of p equal to N f ~ l . We shall denote such a random graph by F , N . In many ( though not all ) of the problems treated in the present paper it does not cause any essential difference if we consider instead of rn N the random graph Q * X , . ON THE EVOLUTION OF RANDOM GRAPHS 2 1 Comparing the method of the present paper with that of [ 10 ] it should be pointed out that our aim is to obtain threshold functions resp . distributions , and thus we are interested in asymptotic formulae for the probabilities con - sidered . Exact formulae are of interest to us only so far as they help in determi - ning the asymptotic behaviour of the probabilities considered ( which is rarely the case in this field , as the exact formulae are in most cases too compli - cated ) . On the other hand in [ 10 ] the emphasis is on exact formulae resp . on generating functions . The only exception is the average number of connected components , for the asymptotic evaluation of which a way is indicated in § 5 . of [ 10 ] ; this question is however more fully discussed in the present paper and our results go beyond that of [ 10 ] . - Moreover , we consider not only the number but also the character of the components . Thus for instance we point out the remarkable change occuring at N - n . If L - ' - ne with c < 1 / 2 2 then with probability tending to 1 for n + - all points except a bounded number of points of rn , N belong to components which are trees , while for N tint with c > 1 this is no longer the case . Further for a fixed value of 2 n the average number of components of rn , N decreases asymptotically in a linear manner with N , when N : < n , while for N > n the formula giving 2 2 the average number of components is not linear in N . In what follows we shall make use of the symbols O and o . As usually a ( n ) = a ( b ( n ) ) ( where b ( n ) > 0 for n = 1 , 2 , . . . ~ means that Mim lI b ( n ) l - 0 , n - + - while a ( n ) = 0 ( b ( n ) ) means that la ( n ) j . is bounded . The parameters on b ( n ) which the bound of ja ( n ) 1 may depend will be indicated if it is necessary ; b ( n ) sometimes we will indicate it by an index . Thus a ( n ) = 0 , ( b ( n ) ) means that ~ a ( n ) I < K ( E ) where K ( E ) is a positive constant depending on e . We write b ( n ) a ( n ) - b ( n ) to denote that Mim a ( n ) = 1 . n + . b ( n ) We shall use the following definitions from the theory of graphs . ( For the general theory see [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] . ) A finite non - empty set V of labelled points P l , P2i . . . , Pn and a set E of different unordered pairs ( P ; , Pj ) with P1 E V , Pi E V , i j is called a graph ; we denote it sometimes by G = { V , E } ; the number n is called the order ( or size ) of the graph ; the points Pl , P2 , . . . , Pn are called the vertices and the pairs ( Pi , Pj ) the edges of the graph . Thus we consider non - oriented finite graphs without parallel edges and without slings . The set E may be empty , thus a collection of points ( especially a single point ) is also a graph . A graph G2 - { V2 , E2 } is called a subgraph of a graph Gl = { Vl , El } if the set of vertices V 2 of G2 Ms a subset of the set of vertices V , of G l and the set EZ of edges of G2 is a subset of the set El of edges of GI . 22 ERDŐS - RÉNYi A sequence of k edges of a graph such that every two consecutive edges and only these have a vertex in common is called a path of order k . A cyclic sequence of k edges of a graph such that every two consecutive edges and only these have a common vertex is called a cycle of order k . A graph G is called connected if any two of its points belong to a path which is a subgraph of G . A graph is called a tree of order ( or size ) k if it has k° vertices , is connected and if none of its subgraphs is a cycle . A tree of order k has evidently k - 1 edges . A graph is called a complete graph of order ~ , if it has k vertices and 2 edges . Thus in a complete graph of order k any two points are connected by an edge . A subgraph G ' of a graph G will be called an isolated subgraph if all edges of G one or both endpoints of which belong to G ' , belong to G ' . A con - nected isolated subgraph G ' of a graph G is called a component of G . The number of points belonging to a component G ' of a graph G will be called the size of G ' . Two graphs shall be called isomorphic , if there exists a one - to - one mapp - ing of the vertices carrying over these graphs into another . The graph G shall be called complementary graph of G if G consists of the same vertices Pl , P2 , . . . . P n as G and of those and only those edges ( P ; , P j ) which do not occur in G . The number of edges starting from the point P of a graph G will be called the degree of P in G . A graph G is called a saturated even graph of type ( a , b ) if it consists of a + b points and its points can be split in two subsets V , and V2 consisting of a resp . b points , such that G contains any edge ( P , Q ) with P E V , and Q E V2 and no other edge . A graph is called planar , if it can be drawn on the plane so that no two of its edges intersect . We introduce further the following definitions : If a graph G has n vertices and N edges , we call the number 2 N the " degree " of the graph . V ( As a matter of fact 21ti is the average degree of the vertices of G . ) If a graph n G has the property that G has no subgraph having a larger degree than G itself , we call G a balanced graph . We denote by P ( . . . ) the probability - of the event in the brackets , by M ( ~ ) resp . D2 ( á ) the mean value resp . variance of the random variable s . In cases when it is not clear from the context in which probability space the probabilities or respectively the mean values and variances are to be under - stood , this will be explicitly indicated . Especially Mn , N resp . Dn , N will denote the mean value resp . variance calculated with respect to the probabilities Pn . N • ( 7 ) ON THE EVOLUTION OF RANDOM GRAPHS We shall often use the following elementary asymptotic formula : k ' - 0 in ! nk e 2n 6n = valid for k = o ( n ' l = ) . k Our thanks are due to T . GALLAI for his valuable remarks . § 1 . Thresholds for subgraphs of given type If N is very small compared with n , namely if N - o ( Vn ) then it is very probable that rn . N is a collection of isolated points and isolated edges , i . e . that no two edges of rn , N have a point in common . As a matter of fact the probability that at least two edges of rn , N shall have a point in common is by ( 7 ) clearly n 2N ) 1 - ~ 2 . ( = 0 ( 1T2 n lnj Y11 ' 23 If however íl c I / Inn where c > 0 is a constant not depending on n . , then the appearance of trees of order 3 will have a probability which tends to a posi - tive limit for n - * + - , but the appearance of a connected component consist - ing of more than 3 points will be still very improbable . If N is increased while n is fixed , the situation will change only if N reaches the order of magnitude of n 2j3 . Then trees of order 4 ( but not of higher order ) will appear with a pro - bability not tending to 0 . In general , the threshold function for the presence k - 2 of trees of order k is nk - 1 ( k = 3 , 4 , . . . ) . This result is contained in the following Theorem 1 . Let k > _ 2 and l ( k - 1 < Z < lk I be positive integers . Let _ l 9 k„ denote an arbitrary not empty class of connected balanced graphs consisting of k points and l edges . The threshold function for the property that the random graph considered should contain at least one subgraph isomorphic with some ele - 2 - k ment of yk , , is n t . The following special cases are worth mentioning Corollary 1 . The threshold function for the property that the random graph k - 2 contains a subgraph which is a tree of order k is nk - I ( k : = 3 , 4 . . . . ) . Corollary 2 . The threshold function for the property that a graph contains a connected subgraph consisting of k > _ 3 points and k edges ( i . e . containing exactly one cycle ) is n , for each value of k . Corollary 3 . The threshold function for the property that a graph contains a cycle of order k is n , for each value of k _ > _ . 3 . 24 Corollary 4 . The threshold function for the property that a graph contains - 1 ) a complete subgraph of order k > _ 3 is n z ( i k - 1 , . Corollary 5 . The threshold function for the property that a graph contains a saturated even subgraph of type ( a , b ) ( i . e . a subgraph consisting of a + b a + b points P1 , . . . , Pa , QI , . . . Q b and of the ab edges ( P 1 , Q j ) is n2 ab . To deduce these Corollaries one has only to verify that all 5 types of graphs figuring in Corollaries 1 - 5 . are balanced , which is easily seen . Proof of Theorem 1 . Let B k I > _ 1 denote the number of graphs belong - ing to the class which can be formed from k given labelled points . Clearly if Pn , N ( & k , l ) denotes the probability that the random graph rn , N contains at least one subgraph isomorphic with some element of the class ^ Vjk , l , then n Pn , N ( & k , l ) < k Bk , 1 ERDŐS - RÉNYI 7 - l = o ` J ( n n21 - k I 12N As a matter of fact if we select k points ( which can be done in 171 different ways ) and form from them a graph isomorphic with some element of the class 66k , í ( which can be done in B k , l different ways ) then the number of graphs G n , N which contain the selected graph as a subgraph is equal to the number of ways the remaining N - 1 edges can be selected from the I 2 n - l other possible edges . ( Of course those graphs , which contain more subgraphs iso - morphic with some element of k , 1 are counted more than once . ) 2 _ k Now clearly if N = o ( n 1 ) then by Pn , N ( k , l ) = O ( 1 ) which proves the first part of the assertion of Theorem 1 . To prove the second part of the theorem let - Vki denote the set of all subgraphs of the complete graph consisting of n points , isomorphic with some element of 56k 1 . To any SE & let us associate a random variable e ( S ) such that E ( S ) = 1 or e ( S ) = 0 according to whether S is a subgraph of P n N or not . Then clearly ( we write in what follows for the sake of brevity W instead of Mn , N ) n l ( 1 . 2 ) M ( ~ E ( S ) 1 = M ( E ( S ) ) _ ( n ) Bk l N - l , Bk , l ( 2 N ) ' .

Thus Theorem 1 is proved . It is interesting to compare the thresholds for the appearance of a sub - graph of a certain type in the above sense with probability near to 1 , with the number of edges which is needed in order that the graph should have necessarily a subgraph of the given type . Such - compulsory " thresholds have been considered by P . TURÁN [ 11 ] ( see also [ 12 ] ) and later by P . ERDŐS and A . 11 . STONE [ 17 ] ) . For instance for a tree of order k clearly the compulsory - ] threshold is I n ( k 2 2 ) + 1 ; for the presence of at least one cycle the com - pulsory threshold is n while according to a theorem of P . TURÁN [ 11 ] for complete subgraphs of order k the compulsory threshold is ( k ? ) ( n2 - r 2 ) + 2 ( k - 1 ) where r = - n - ( k - - 1 ) ~ - - v In the paper [ 13 ] of T . KŐVÁ RI , ~ 21 Is - 11 ' V . T . Sós and P . TuRÁN it has been shown that the compulsory threshold for the presence of a saturated even subgraph of type ( a , a ) is of order of magni - tude not greater than n2 a . In all cases the " compulsory " thresholds in TURÁN ' s sense are of greater order of magnitude as our " probable " thresholds . § 2 . Trees Now let us turn to the determination of threshold distribution functions for trees of a given order . We shall prove somewhat more , namely that if k - 2 N e nk - 1 where o > 0 , then the number of trees of order k contained in rn , N has in the limit for n - y + oo a Poisson distribution with mean value _ ( 2 P ) k 1 kk - z V . This implies that the threshold distribution function for trees of order k is 1 - e - ~ . In proving this we shall count only isolated trees of order k in Fn N , i - e . trees of order k which are isolated subgraphs of I ' n N ' According to Theorem 1 . this makes no essential difference , because if there would be a tree of order k which is a subgraph but not an isolated subgraph of P n N , then rr , , N would have a connected subgraph consisting of k + 1 points and the probability - ( of this is tending to 0 if N = o l - n . k which condition is fulfilled in our k - 2 case as we suppose N - g . n k - I . Thus we prove Theorem 2a .

Note that Theorem 2c generalizes the results of the paper [ 7 ] , where only the case 1c = 1 is considered . § 3 . Cycles Let us consider now the threshold function of cycles of a given order . The situation is described by the following Theorem 3a . Suppose that ( 3 . 1 ) N ( n ) - c n where e > 0 . Let yk denote the number of cycles of order k contained in F , , N ( k = 3 , 4 , . . . ) .

Suppose again that ( 3 . 1 ) holds . Let yk denote the number of isolated cycles of order k contained in rn N ( k = 3 , 4 , . . . ) . Then we have ( 3 . 4 ) lira P * = j ) _ UJ e u ( Í = 0 , 1 , . . ) n , N ( n ) ( Yk ) n - + ? where ( 2 r ( 3 . 5 ) e - 2c ) k , u = 2k Remark .

The details may be left to the reader . Similar results can be proved for other types of subgraphs , e . g . complete subgraphs of a given order . As however these results and their proofs have the same pattern as those given above we do not dwell on the subject any longer and pass to investigate global properties of the random graph T , , , . § 4 . The total number of points belonging to trees We begin by proving Theorem 4a . If N = o ( n ) the graph rn N is , with probability tending to 1 for n - > - + - , the union of disjoint trees . Proof of Theorem 4a . A graph consists of disjoint trees if and only if there are no cycles in the graph . The number of graphs Gn , N which contain at least one cycle can be enumerated as was shown in § 1 for each value k o£ the length of this cycle . In this way , denoting by T the property that the graph is a union of disjoint trees , and by T the opposite of this property , i . e . that the graph contains at least one cycle , we have ( n ) - k . N - k , . _ O ~ Nj . in n 2 ) N ) It follows that if N = o ( n ) we have lim Pn N ( T ) = 1 which proves Theorem 4a . n - • - If N is of the same order of magnitude as n i , e . il ' - c22 with c > 0 , then the assertion of Theorem 4a is no longer true . Nevertheless if c < 1 / 2 , ON THE EVOLUTION OF RANDOM GRAPHS still almost all points ( in fact n - 0 ( 1 ) points ) of I ' n N belong to isolated trees . There is however a surprisingly abrupt change in the structure of " n , N with 1V - en , when c surpasses the value 2 . If c > 1 / 2 in the average only a positive fraction of all points Of rn , N belong to isolated trees , and the value of this fraction tends to 0 for c + . Thus we shall prove Theorem 4b . Let ti ' n , , , denote the number of those points of Tn N which belong to an isolated tree contained in hn , N . Let us suppose that ( 4 . 2 ) hill N ( v ) = c > 0 . n - - - n Then we have ( / 1 for c < 1 / 2 M ( y ~ n .

Then clearly n ( 4 . 8 ) V n N = N k - r d k k = 1 and thus n ( 4 . 9 ) M ( i ' n , N ) _ ` k M ( T I ) . k = 1 By ( 2 . 18 ) , if ( 4 . 2 ) holds , we have V1 ( 4 . 10 ) lim 1 M ( ~ k ) _ 1 k - 2 ( 2 c e - 2c ) k n - + . n 2c kI 37 38 ( 4 . 13 ) n - > + . n holds with c > 1 / 2 we obtain ( 4 . 15 ) M ( Vn N ( n ) ) = n 2 n 2N ERDŐS - RÉNYI Thus we obtain from ( 4 . 10 ) that for c < 1 / 2 ( 4 . 11 ) lim inf M ( Vn , N ( n ) ) > I kk - 1 ( 2 c e - 2c ) k for any s > . 1 . nJ - + ~ n - 2c k _ 1 k !

But according to ( 4 . 7 ) for c < 1j2 we have kk - 1 ( 2 c e - 2c ) k = 2c . k = 1 k ! Thus it follows from ( 4 . 12 ) that for c < _ 112 lim inf M ( V n , N ( n ) ) > _ 1 . n - . n As however Vn , N ( n ) n and thus lim sup ~ I ( yrn , N ( n ) ) < 1 it follows that n - ~ n if ( 4 . 2 ) holds and c < 1 / 2 we have ( 4 . 14 ) lim M ( Vn , N ( n ) ) = I . Now let us consider the case c > 1 . It follows from ( 2 . 18 ) that if ( 4 . 2 ) kk - 1 2 N ( n ) - 2Nnn ) ~ k k ! n e 0 ( 1 ) where the bound of the term 0 ( 1 ) depends only on c . As however for N ( n ) N - nc with c > 1 / 2 kk - 1 J2 AT ( n ) e - 2 N ( n ) , k k = , , + 1 k ! n n it follows that ( 4 . 16 ) M ( Vn , N ( n ) ) = 2 2 _ x ( ln ) 1 + 0 ( 1 ) where x = x ( N ( n ) n 1 is the only solution with o < x < 1 of the equation I ` JI 2 N ( n ) - 2N ( n ) xe - x = e n Thus it follows that if ( 4 . 2 ) holds with c > 1 / 2 n we have ( 4 . 17 ) lim M ( Vn , N ( n ) ) _ x ( c ) n - . + m n 2c where x ( c ) is defined by ( 4 . 5 ) .

Let us remark that in the same way as we obtained ( 4 . 16 ) we get that if ( 4 . 2 ) holds with c < 1 / 2 we have ( 4 . 18 ) M ( V n , N ( n ) ) = n - 0 ( 1 ) where the bound of the 0 ( 1 ) term depends only on c . ( However ( 4 . 18 ) is not , true for c = 1 as will be shown below . ) 2 It follows by the well known inequality of Markov ( 4 . 19 ) P ( ~ > a ) _ < - 1 M ( s ) a , valid for any nonnegative random variable ~ and any a > M ( ~ ) , that the following theorem holds : Theorem 4c .

We prove Theorem 4d . Let " , , , N denote the number of those points of rn , N which belong to an isolated tree contained in . Let us suppose that ( 4 . 2 ) holds with c > 1 / 2 . It follows that if wn tends arbitrarily slowly to + we have ( 4 . 21 ) " M P 1 , n2 ' rl ( n ) V n , N ( n ) - 9 N ( n ) x ( 1 n I ~ n a ) n where x = x ~ N ( n ) - ~ is the only solution with 0 < x < 1 of the equation l n 2N ( n ) Te - x - 2 ~ 4T ( n } _ e n n . k Proof . We have clearly , as the series } k ( 2 ce - 2 c ) k is convergent , h ` _ , k t D2 ( Vn , N ( n ) ) = 0 ( n ) . Thus ( 4 . 21 ) follows by the inequality of Chebyshev . Remark . It follows from ( 4 . 21 ) that we have for any c > 112 and any e > o ( 4 . 22 ) hm P iVmN ( n ) _ x ( c ) < e = 1 n - + - n 2 c where x ( c ) is defined by ( 4 . 5 ) . As regards the case c ij2 we formulate the theorem which will be needed latter . ON THE EVOLUTION OF RANDOM GRAPHS 41 Theorem 4e .

The total number of points belonging to cycles Let us determine first the average number of all cycles in rn N . W e prove that this number remains bounded if N ( n ) cn and c < 1 ' 2 but not if c = 1f2 . Theorem 5a . Let H n , N denote the number of all cycles contained in F , , , N . Then we have if N ( n ) - V en holds with c < 1 2 ( 5 . 1 ) ' I ' ll M ( Hn , N ( n ) ) = 2 log 1 12 c - c - c 2 n Ta while we have for c - 1 2 ( 5 . 2 ) M ( H , , N ( n ) ) - 4 log n . Proof . Clearly - i£ y k is the number of all cycles of order I contained in - r , , , N we have n Hn , N = G yk - k = I Now ( 5 . 1 ) follows easily , taking into account that ( see ( 3 . 8 ) ) l2l k 2N k M 1 0 k2 ( Yk ) 2 ( k ~ ( k ) n 2 k + ~ 2 N 4 2 ERDŐS - - RÉNYI If c = 1f 2 we have by ( 3 . 8 ) 30 ( 5 . 1 ) M ( Yk ) 2 Ic e 2n n 1 _ 3k ' 1 As } e 2n - loge , it follows that ( 5 . 2 ) holds . Thus Theorem 5a k = 3 2 k 4 is proved . Let us remark that it follows from ( 5 . 2 ) that ( 4 . 18 ) is not true for c = 1 / 2 . Similarly as before we can prove corresponding results concerning the random variable H n N itself . We have for instance in the case c = 1 / 2 for any s > o lim P ( H n . N ( n ) - 1 ' < a = 1 . ( 5 . 5 ) n - . + ~ logn 4 This can be proved by the sane method as used above : estimating the variance and using the inequality of Chebyshev . An other related result , throwing more light on the appearance of cycles in P n , N runs as follows . Theorem 5h . Let K denote the property that a . graph contains at least one cycle . Then we have i f N ( n ) . no holds with c 1 / 2 ( 5 . 6 ) lira P n , N ( n ) ( K ) = 1 - 1 - 2 c e + ' ~ Y . n - - + z Thus for e = 1 it is , almost sure " that rn N ( n ) contains at least one cycle , while 2 for c < 1 the limit for n - > + co of the probability of this is less than 1 . 2 Proof . Let us suppose first c < . By an obvious sieve ( taking into account that according to Theorem 1 the probability that there will be in I ' n , N ( n ) with N ( n ) ~ - no ( c < 1 / 2 ) two circles having a point in common is negligibly small ) we obtain ( 5 . 7 ) _ lim M ( H„ , ~ v ( „i ) lim Pn , N ( n ) ( K ) = e 1 - 2 e eC + ~ ~ . - Thus ( 5 . 6 ) follows for c < 1 / 2 . As for c 1 / 2 the function on the right of ( 5 . 6 ) tends to 1 , it follows that ( 5 . 6 ) holds for c = 1 / 2 too . The function y = - 1 - V1 - 2c eC + C = is shown on Fig . 3 . We prove now the following Theorem 5c . Let Hn , N denote the total number of points of rnN which belong to some cycle . Then we have for N = N ( n ) on with 0 e c < ' 1 / 2 ( 5 . 8 ) lim M ( H 4 ca n , N ( n ) ) - n . + ~ 1 - 2c ( 5 . 10 ) 1 0 ON THE EVOLUTION OF RANDOM GRAPHS Figure 3 . Proof of Theorem 5c . As according to Theorem 1 the probability that two cycles should have a point in common is negligibly small , we have by ( 5 . 3 ) tJ = 1 - v1 - 2r , . ec , c M ( Hn n k y4 _ ( 2c ) 3 4c 3 , N ( n ) ) Z k = t 2 ( 1 - 2c ) 1 - 2c The size of that part of I ' n , N which does not consist of trees is still more clearly shown by the following Theorem 5d . Let ~ 0n , N denote the number of those points of rn N which belong to components containing exactly one cycle . Then we have for N = N ( n ) - en in case c * 1 12 ( 5 . 9 ) lien M ( On , N ( n ) ) = 1 ( 2 ee - 2 c ) k ~ 1 + k + + . . . + 0 - 3 n - ~ 2 g _ _ g 1 ! 21 ( k - 3 ) ! while for c = 1 / 2 we have h ~ 1 ~ M 3 n 2 , r3 ( n , N ( n ) 12 12 where I ( x ) denotes the gamma - function 1 ' ( x ) _ f tx - 1 e - t dt for x > 0 . 0 43 44 M ( ' 9i ; , N ( n ) ) Remark . Note that for c - ~ 1 / 2 ERDŐS - RÉNYI Proof of Theorem 5d . ( 5 . 9 ) follows immediately from ( 3 . 11 ) ; for c - 1 ; 2 we have by ( 3 . 14 ) k ' ~ I 13 ) e n ~ . ti b 2 3 . 1 2 1 ( J ce - 2c ) k j + 1k , + . . . kk - 3 1 2 ( k - 3 ) 11 4 ( 1 - 2c ) 2 Thus the average number of points belonging to components containing exactly one cycle tends to + - as 1 for c - * 1 1 ` 2 . 4 ( 1 - 2 c ) 2 We now prove Theorem 5e . For í1 ( n ) - v cn with 0 < c < ' / 2 all camponents of r n . lY ( n ) are with probability tending to 1 for n either trees or components contain - ing exactly one cycle . Proof . Let ipn , , N , denote the number of points of F , ' , v ; belonging to com - ponents which contain more edges than vertices and the number of vertices of which is less than V log n . We have clearly for X ( n ) cn with c < 1 ' 2 2 [ log n - k ( kl r log2 M ( Vn , N ( n ) ) < _ k l n I 2 21 - ~ - ~ - - 1 - 0 ( n 2 - 1 ~ k = 41 k n ( 12 Thus P ( Vn , N ( n ) > 1 ) - 0 ( 1 log2 ) 22 On the other hand by Theorem 4c the probability that a component con - sisting of more than V log n points should not be a tree tends to 0 . Thus the assertion of Theorem 5e follows . § 6 . The number of components Let us turn now to the investigation of the average number of compo - nents of It will be seen that the above discussion contains a fairly com - plete solution of this question . We prove the following Theorem 6 . If ~ n N denotes the number of components of r , , N then we have if N ( n ) - on holds with 0 < c < 12 ( 6 . 1 ) M ( sn , N ( n ) ) = 9t - N ( n ) - } - 0 ( 1 ) where the bound of the 0 - term depends only on c .

Clearly if we 2 add a new edge to a graph , then either this edge connects two points belong - ing to different components , in which case the number of components is decreased by 1 , or it connects two points belonging to the same component in which case the number of components does not change but at least one new cycle is created . Thus 2 ( 6 . 5 ) where Proof of Theorem ON THE EVOLUTION ' OF RANDOM GRAPHS 45 lim M ( ~ rz , N ( n ) ) _ - I x ( e ) - X2 ( C ) } n - - + m 9t 2 C 22 6 . Let us consider first the case Sn , N - ( n - N ) < Hn , N where Hn , N is the total number of cycles in ' . , N . Thus by Theorem 5a it follows that ( 6 . 1 ) holds . Similarly ( 6 . 2 ) follows also from Theorem 5a . Now we consider the case 1 C > - . 2 It is easy to see that for o < y < 1 we have ( see e . g .

To prove the second part , let us remark first that the number of compo - nents of order greater than 4 is clearly < . Thus if n , ti .

As 4 can be chosen arbitrarily large we obtain from ( 6 . 9 ) that n ( 6 . 10 ) MGl ? , n , ) - o , M ( T k ) - k = 1 According to ( 2 . 18 ) it follows that n 2 - ` n kk - 2 2 N - 2 k ( 6 . 11 ) M ( ; n , N ) e n . 2k 1 k ! n and thus , according to ( 6 . 6 ) if N ( n ) - cn holds with c > 1 , 12 We have ( 6 . 12 ) lim MGn , N ( n1 ) = 1 . x ( c ) - xu ( c ) n - - n 2 e 2 where x ( c ) is defined by ( 6 . 4 ) . Thus Theorem 6 is completely proved . Let us add some remarks . Theorem 6 illustrates also the fundamental change in the structure of which takes place if IV passes n . While the average number of components of - r , , , N ( as a function of N with n fixed ) decreases linearly if N < n this is no longer true for N > n ; the average 2 2 number of components decreases from this point onward more and more slowly .

The size of the greatest tree If N - cn with c < 1 / 2 then as we have seen in § 6 all but a finite num - ber of points of F , N belong to components which are trees . Thus in this case the problem of determining the size of the largest component of F , , N reduces to the easier question of determining the greatest tree in " , , N . This question is answered by the following . Theorem 7a . Let do , ~ denote the number of points of the greatest tree which is a component of F . , N * Suppose N = N ( n ) - cn with c + 1 / 2 . Let wn be a sequence 48 tending arbitrarily slowly to + ~ . Then we have ( 7 . 1 ) s lim P 4 n , N ( n ) > f log n - 2 loglog nI + ( o r , = 0 and ( 7 . 2 ) lim P An , Mn ) > _ I log n - 2 loglog n w n ~ - s = 1 where ( 7 . 3 ) e - a = 2 ee1 - 2 c ( i . e . a = 2 c - 1 - log 2 c and thus a > 0 . ) Proof of Theorem 7a . We have clearly ( 7 . 4 ) P ( d nMO > - z ) = P f Z k > I < ` k > x k ? z and thus by ( 2 . 18 ) ne ° x1 ( 7 . 5 ) POn , N ( n ) > z ) - O - Z 5 , 2 It follows that if z 1 = 1 log 71 - 5 loglog nl + co n a 2 we have ( 7 . 6 ) P ( ln , N ( n ) z zi ) = O ( e °n ) This proves ( 7 . 1 ) . To prove ( 7 . 2 ) we have to estimate the mean and variance of r , , where z 2 = I ( log n - 2 loglog n ~ - w n . We have by ( 2 . 18 ) 1 5 ~ ` 2 ( 7 . 7 ) M ( TZ2 ) a eaw - 2cV27r and ( 7 . 8 ) Clearly ERDŐS - RÉ NYI D2 ( r , , ) = O ( M ( Zzs » .

Thus we obtain ( 7 . 10 ) P ( 4 n , N ( n ) > - z2 ) I - O ( e - aw n ) . Thus ( 7 . 2 ) is also proved . Remark .

A11 - 2 . 49 of I ' n N , as T n , N contains with probability tending to 1 besides trees only com - ponents containing a single circle and being of moderate size . This follows evidently from Theorem 4c . As will be seen in what follows ( see § 9 ) for c > 1 the situation is completely different , as in this case rn N contains 2 a very large component ( in fact of size G ( c ) n with G ( c ) > 0 ) which is not a tree . Note that if we put c = 1 log nn we have a = 1 log n and 1 log n k 2k k a in conformity - with Theorem 2c . We can prove also the following Theorem 7b . If N - en , where c - / - 1 and e = 2ce 1 - 2 c then the number 2 of isolated trees of order h = flog n - 5 loglog n , + l resp . of order > _ h ( where I is an arbitrary real - number such that h is a positive - integer ) contained in Fn , N has for large it approximately a Poisson distribution with the mean value I = a s 2 6 - al res p . _ a5 !

This could be guessed from the fact that the constant factor in the expression 1 log n - 5 loglog n of the . probable size " of the greatest compo - nent of Fn , N figuring in Theorem 7a becomes infinitely large if c = 1 . 2 For the size of the greatest tree in F„ , N with N - n the following 2 result is valid : Theorem 7c . If N - n and 4 , , , N denotes again the number of points 2 of the greatest tree contained in I ' n N , we have for any sequence co n tending to ~ - ~ for n + - ( 7 . 11 ) 11111 P ( 4 n N > . 11213Wn ) = 0 n - - T and 1 Corollary .

We have by some simple computation using ( 7 ) ( ín - kl kk _ 2 22 N - k + ( 7 . 13 ) M ( zk ) _ Thus it follows that ~ n ti f21 ERDŐS - RÉNYI nk k - 2 e - k e 6n ' . k1 ( 7 . 14 ) P d > n 2 - 3 w < M t O í 1 ( n N = n ) = k ~ ~ mn ( k ) - V ~ 0n which proves ( 7 . 11 ) . On the other hand , considering the mean and variance of z * _ it follows that M ( a * ) z A ( 03 ' 2 where A > 0 and Dz ( t * ) = 0 ( 0 ) 3 ! 2 ) and ( 7 . 12 ) follows by using again the inequality of Chebyshev . Thus Theorem 7c is proved . The following theorem can be proved by developing further the above argument and using Lemma 1 . Theorem 7d . Let r ( y ) denote the number of trees of order > yn2 1 3 contained in rn , N ( n ) where 0 < y < + - and N ( n ) tin . Then we have 2 ( 7 . 15 ) where ( 7 . 16 ) e - ' " M Pn , N ( n ) ( T ( P ) = 9 ) = , h - ( j = 0 , 1 , . . . ) + m = 1 e - x dx . V12 n x 3 ; 2 s k ~ , n z " - Tk ' § 8 . When is F , , , N a planar graph ? We have seen that the threshold for a subgraph containing k points k and k + d edges is n2 k + a ; thus if N en the probability of the presence of a subgraph having k points and k + d edges in Fn , N tends to 0 for n - + - , for each particular pair of numbers k > 4 , d > 1 . This however does not imply that the probability of the presence of a graph of arbitrary order having more edges than vertices in rn N with N - nc tends also to 0 for n - { - ~ . In fact this is not true for c > _ If2 as is shown by the following Theorem 8a . Let Y . N ( d ) denote the number of cycles of Gn , N of arbitrary order which are such that exactly d diagonals of the cycle belong also to pn , N . Then if N ( n ) = n + ~ n 2 + o ( V - n ) where - ~ < A < + - , we have ( 8 . 1 ) where ( 8 . 2 ) and thus if N ( n ) = n + R Vn + o ( Vn ) 2 4 * ON THE EVOLUTION OF RANDOM GRAPHS 2 51 lim P ( Yn , N ( n ) ( d ) = y ) _ eJ e - Q ( j = 0 , 1 , . . . ) n - + w j1 AY 0 1 2a - iel ' 3 •e 2 d P = 2 . 6 a d ! y y • o Proof of Theorem 8a . We have clearly as the number of diagonals of a k - gon is equal to k ( k - 3 ) k ( k - 3 ) l2 ~ ~ 2 , n - - M ( xn , N ( d ) ) = ~ 1 ~ n l ( k - 1 ) f 2 N n k d , t JI d l 21N n f k 3 k ' ( 8 . 4 ) M ( Xn , N ( n ) ( d ) } ^ ' 2a + a ld ! nd k2d - 1 I 1 + V n e 2n k = 4 It follows from ( 8 . 4 ) that W a ~ ~ 1 ra lim M ( Xn , N ( n ) ( d ) ) = 2 6a d yea - 1 e Y3 2 dy . 0 The proof can be finished by the same method as used in proving Theorem 2a . Remark . Note that Theorem 8a implies that if N ( n ) = n + con V 2 with wn + °O then the probability that F , , , N ( n ) contains cycles with any prescribed number of diagonals tends to 1 , while if N ( n ) = n - wn Vn 2 the same probability tends to 0 . This shows again the fundamental difference in the structure of ' , , N between the cases N < n and N > n . This differ - 2 2 ence can be expressed also in the form of the following Theorem 8h . Let us suppose that N ( n ) - nc . If c < 1 the probability 2 5 2 ERDŐS - RÉNYI that the graph rn , N ( , ) is planar is tending to 1 while for c > 1 this probability tends to 0 . Proof of Theorem 8b . As well known trees and connected graphs contain - ing exactly one cycle are planar . Thus the first part of Theorem Sb follows from Theorem 5e . On the other hand if a graph contains a cycle with 3 dia - gonals such that if these diagonals connect the pairs of points ( P ; , P i ) ( i = = 1 , 2 , 3 ) the cyclic order of these points in the cycle is such that each pair ( P ; , P , ) dissects the cycle into two paths which both contain two of the other points then the graph is not planar . Now it is easy to see that among the k ( k - 3 ) 2 k . 3 ( l triples of 3 diameters of a given cycle of order k there are at least 6 triples which have the mentioned property and thus for large values of k approximately one out of 15 choices of the 3 diagonals will have the mentioned property . It follows that if N ( n ) _ n + CJ ' , I / rn with wn + - , the proba - bility that I ' n N ( n ) is not planar tends to 1 for n - ~ + - . This proves Theorem 8b . We can show that for N ( n ) = n + 7 . with any real A the probability 2 of rn N ( n ) not being planar has a positive lower limit , but we cannot calculate is value . It may even be 1 , though this seems unlikely . § 9 . On the growth of the greatest component We prove in this § ( see Theorem 9b ) that the size of the greatest com - ponent of r n N ( n ) is for N ( n ) - en with c > I / 2 with probability tending to 1 approximately G ( c ) n where ( 9 . 1 ) G ( c ) = 1 - x ( c ) 2e and x ( c ) is defined by ( 6 . 4 ) . ( The curve y = G ( c ) is shown on Fig . 2b ) . Thus by Theorem 6 for N ( n ) en with c > 1 / 2 almost all points of rn N ( n ) ( i . e . all but o ( n ) points ) belong either to some small component which is a tree ( of size at most 1 / a ( logn - 2 loglogn ) + 0 ( 1 ) where a = 2c - 1 - log 2c by Theorem 7a ) or to the single " giant " component of the size - G ( C ) n . Thus the situation can be summarized as follows : the largest component of rn N ( n ) is of order loge for N ( n ) _ c < 1 / 2 , of order n2 , ' 3 for ( n ) 1 and n n 2 of order n for INT ( n ) N c > 1 / 2 . This double " jump " of the size of the largest n component when N ( n ) passes the value 1 / 2 is one of the most striking facts n concerning random graphs . We prove first the following 0 \ THE EVOLUTION OF RANDOM GRAPHS 53 Theorem 9a . Let , - r , , , N ( A ) denote the set of those points of rn , N which belong to components of size > A , and let ff . , N ( A ) denote the number of elements of the set n , N ( A ) . If N 1 ( n ) ( c - s ) n where e > 0 , c - s > 1 / 2 and N 2 ( n ) en then with probability tending to 1 for n - - - > - + - from the H , , N , ( n ) ( A ) points belonging to . - Tn , Nl ( n ) ( A ) more than ( 1 - b ) Hn , N , ( n ) ( A ) points will be contained in the same component of ~ n , N2 ( n ) for any b with 0 < b < 1 provided that ( 9 . 2 ) A > 50 E2 62 Proof of Theorem 9a . According to Theorem 2b the number of points belonging to trees of order : < A is with probability tending to 1 for n - ~ + equal to / q kk - 1 n - [ 2 ( c , - E ) ] k - 1 eo ( n ) . ~ . k = 1 kl On the other hand , the number of points of rn N , ( n ) belonging to components of size _ < A and containing exactly one cycle is according to Theorem 3c o ( n ) for c - e > 112 ( with probability tending to 1 ) , while it is easy to see , that the number of points of I ' n , Nl ( n ) belonging to components of size < A and containing more than one cycle is also bounded with probability tending to 1 . ) Our last statement follows by using the inequality ( 4 . 19 ) from the fact that the average number of components of the mentioned type is , as a simple calculation similar to those carried out in previous § § , shows , of order 0 1 . I n ( 9 . 3 ) Let En 1 ) denote the event that ~ Hn , Nl ( n ) ( A ) - nf ( A , c - E ) I < znf ( A , c - E ) where r > 0 is an arbitrary small positive number which will be chosen later and f ( A , c ) = 1 - c kk - 1 ( 2 ce - 2 C ) > 0 and let E ; , 1 ) denote the contrary event . It follows from what has been said that ( 9 . 5 ) lim P ( E ( , 1 ) ) = 0 . n - ; We consider only such rn N , ( , ) for which ( 9 . 3 ) holds . Now clearly I ' n , N , ( n ) is obtained from - P . NI ( n ) by adding N2 ( n ) - Y , _ ( n ) ~ - - ns new edges at random to r n N , ( n ) . The probability that such a new edge should f Hn , Nj ( n ) ( A ) - AT 2 ( n ) connect two points belonging to n , Ni ( n ) ( A ) , is at least I1 2 ( n ~ 2 and thus by ( 9 . 3 ) is not less than ( 1 - 2z ) f2 ( A , c - e ) , if n is sufficiently large and ' r sufficiently small . 54 As these edges are chosen independently from each other , it follows by the law of large numbers that denoting by v n the number of those of the N 2 ( n ) - N 1 ( n ) new edges which connect two points of n . Nl ( n ) and by E ( 2 ) the event that ( 9 . 6 ) v n > _ E ( 1 - 3r ) J2 ( A , c - E ) n and by En 2 ) the contrary event , we have ( 9 . 7 ) lim P ( En 2 ) ) = 0 . n - - . + We consider now only such rn N2 ( n ) for which En 2 ) takes place . - Now let us consider the subgraph rn NE ( n ) of I ' n , N2 ( n ) formed by the points of the set n , N ( , , ) ( A ) and only of those edges of r .

Put S j = a ( j = 1 , 2 , . . . , r ) . Let jo denote the least integer , for which S j > 1 / 2 . In case S jo - 1 / 2 > 1 / 2 - S jo _ 1 choose k = j o - 1 , while in case Sao l - 1 / 2 S 1 / 2 - S 1o _ 1 choose k = j o . In both cases we have I S k - 1 / 2 1 < amp < a which proves our Lemma . 2 2 Let the sizes of the components of Fn N2 ( n ) be denoted by b 1 , b 2 , . . . , br . Let En3 ) denote the event ( 9 . 9 ) max b j > Hn , NI ( n ) ( A ) ( 1 - S ) and E ( , , 3 ) the contrary event . Applying our Lemma with a = 1 - b to the numbers aj = bj it follows that if the event E n ( 3 ) takes place , the H n , Nl ( n ) ( A ) Set ` n N , ( n ) ( A ) can be split in two subsets An and rn containing Hn and Hn points such that Hn } Hn = H n , NI ( n ) ( A ) and ( 9 . 10 ) H , , Nl ( n ) ( A ) 2 S min ( Hn , H " t ) < max ( Hn , Hn ) < H , , , N , ( n ) ( A ) I I - 2 , further no point of . ° ' is connected with a point of rn in F * , N2 ( n ) It follows that if a point P of the set ' - - n Nl ( n ) ( A ) belongs to n ( resp . ten } then all other points of the component of I ' n , NI ( n ) to which P belongs are ON THE EVOLUTION OF RANDOM GRAPHS 55 also contained in rn ( resp . rf ) . As the number of components of size > A Of rn , Ni ( n ) is clearly < Hn , N ) ( A ) th e number of such divisions of the set 1 xR ~ . ~ > ( A ) - °n , N , ( n ) ( A ) does not exceed 2A If further En 3 ) takes place then every one of the v„ new edges connect - ing points of n .

The possible number of such choices of these edges is clearly As by ( 9 . 10 ) it follows that ( 9 . 12 ) H , 1 and thus by ( 9 . 3 ) and ( 9 . 6 ) ( 2n + 2 l I2rZ 2 ) wn ~ Hn 2 2 b 2 2 1 , 1 < + ( 11á + b < 1a . - = - - 4 l 21 2 2 1 H , . v , 1n7 ( A ) ( á 2 ~ e ( 1 - 3r ) f 2 ( A , e - e ) n P ( E ( n3 ) < 2A 1 - ( 9 . 13 ) P ( En3 » < exp 1nf ( A , c - e ) ~ ( 1 + - r ) log 2 e ( 1 - 3 i ) f ( Á , e s ) á A 2 1 Thus if ( 9 . 14 ) A sá ( 1 - 3 z ) f ( A , c - s ) > ( 1 + z ) log o then ( 9 . 15 ) 1im P ( EW ) = 0 . nom + As however in case c - e > i / 2 we have I ( A , c - e ) > G ( c - s ) > 0 for any A , while in case c - s - . 1 / 2 ( 9 . 15x ) f lA , 1 = I - kk - 1 = kk - 1 > _ 1 if A z Ao 2 . k = 1 k 1 Ck k = A + , k ! ek 2 VA the inequality ( 9 . 13 ) will be satisfied provided that r < 1 and A > 50 10 E 2á2 Thus Theorem 9a is proved . Clearly the " giant " component of rn , N2 ( n ) the existence of which ( with probability tending to 1 ) has been now proved , contains more than ( 1 - T ) ( 1 - á ) nf ( A , c - s ) 56 ERDŐS - E ( ; N l I points . By choosing e , t and 6 sufficiently small and A sufficiently large , ( 1 - z ) ( 1 - S ) f ( A , c - E ) can be brought as near to G ( c ) as we want . Thus we have incidentally proved also the following Theorem 9b . Let en , , , , denote the size of the greatest component of rn , N ' If V ( n ) - en where c > lf2 we have for any 7 ) > 0 ( 9 . 16 ) lim P Qn , N ( n ) - G ( c ) n - - ~ , ' n k 1 where G ( c ) = 1 - x ( c ) and x ( c ) _ - ( 2c e - 2c ) k is the solution satisfying 2c k - 1 k . 0 < x ( c ) < 1 of the equation x ( c ) e - Y ( c ) = 2ce - 2c Remark . As G ( c ) - - - > - 1 for c - * + - it follows as a corollary - from Theorem 9b that the size of the largest component will exceed ( 1 - a ) n if c is suffi - ciently large where a > 0 is arbitrarily small . This of course could be proved directly . As a matter of fact , if the greatest component of r , , , N ( , , ) with N ( n ) - vne would not exceed ( 1 - a ) n ( we - denote this event by Bn ( a , c ) ) one could by Lemma 2 divide the set V of the nn points Pl , . . . , Pn in two subsets P resp .

ON THE EVOLUTION OF RANDOM GRAPHS 57 ' e have seen that for N ( n ) - en with c > 112 the random graph r n , N ( n ) consists with probability tending to 1 , neglecting l o ( n ) points , only of isolated k 2 trees ( there being approximately n k - ( 2c e - 2c ) k trees of order k ) and of 2c k ! a single giant component of size G ( c ) n . Clearly the isolated trees melt one after another into the giant compo - nent , the " danger " of being absorbed by the " giant " being greater for larger components . As shown by Theorem 2e for N ( n ) 21 k n log n only isolated trees of order < k survive , while for N ( n ) - 1 / 2 n log n - ~ + - the whole n graph will with probability tending to 1 be connected . An interesting question is : what is the " life - time " distribution of an isolated tree of order k which is present for AT ( n ) - cn ? This question is answered by the following Theorem 9r , . The probability that an isolated tree of order k which is present in . 1 , , N , ( . ) where N , ( n ) - ~ - cn and c > 1 / 2 should still remain an isolated tree in rn M ( n ) where í1 ' 2 ( n ) ( c + t ) n ( t > 0 ) is approximately e - 2kt ; thus the „Life - time " of a tree of order k has approximately an exponential distribution with mean value n and is independent of the " age " of the tree . 2 k - Proof . The probability that no point of the tree in question will be connected with any other point is ( n - k ` N , ( n ) 2 I - 9 + k , 1 e - 2kt n , l = N , ( n ) + I ~ ~ - This proves Theorem 9e . § 10 .

( Only Theorem 1 embraces some problems concerning the range N ( n ) - n , with 1 < a < 2 . ) We want to deal with the structure of rnN ( n ) for N ( n ) - cn° with a > 1 in greater detail in a fortcoming paper ; here we make in this direction only a few remarks . First it is easy to see that - P , , ( r ) N ( n ) is really nothing else , than the 2 complementary graph of Fn , N ( n ) • Thus each of our results can be reformulated to give a result on the probable structure of " , , N with N being not much less than In For instance , the structure of r n N will have a second abrupt 2 change when ű ' passes the value n ; if N < ~ nl - en with C > 1 / 2 2 2 22 then the complementary graph of - F , , N will contain a connected graph of order f ( c ) n , while for c < i / 2 this ( missing ) " giant " will disappear . 58 ERDŐS - RÉNYI To show a less obvious example of this principle of getting result for N near to ~ 2 , let us consider the maximal number of pairwise independent 2 points in rn , N • ( The vertices P and Q of the graph F are called independent if they are not connected by an edge ) . Evidently if a set of k points is independent in rn , N ( n ) then the same points form a complete subgraph in the complementary graph rn , N ( n ) • As however rn , N ( n ) has the same structure as F n ( Z ) _ N ( n ) it follows by Theorem 1 , that there will be in rn , N ( n ) almost surely no k independent points if rn , - 2 - - N ( n ) = o In2 ( 1 k 11 ) iL e . if N ( n ) _ rn , - o n2 ( 1 - k 1 i . ) but there will be in 2 i rn , N ( n ) almost surely k independent points if N ( n ) _ ( ~ - co , , n2 0 - k - i - where co n tends arbitrarily slowly to + - . An other interesting question is : what can be said about the degrees of the vertices of rn , N • We prove in this direction the followingTheorem 10 . Let Dn , N ( n ) ( Pk ) denote the degree of the point Pk in rn , N ( n ) ( i . e . the number of points of rn , N ( n ) which are connected with Pk by an edge ) . Put D n = min D , , , N ( n ) ( Pk ) and D n = max Dn , N ( n ) ( Pk ) I < k : s ~ n t < kSn Suppose that ( 10 . 1 ) lim N ( n ) = T o0 n + m n log n Then we have for any e > o ( 10 . 2 ) lim e f D We have further for N ( n ) ~ - ca for any k ( 10 . 3 ) n + ~ Dn n - 1 Proof . The probability that a given vertex P k shall be connected by exactly r others in rn , N is n - 1 n - i 1 ) 2 h ~ 2N ~ r - 2N n e r N - r , N n . ( ~ n 2 , N r ! lim P ( Dn , N ( n ) ( pk ) _ % ) _ ( 2 c ) J e - 2c ( i - 0 , 1 , . . . ~ ) • n - - + - ? proximately OA THE EVOLUTION OF RANDOM GRAPHS thus if N ( n ) - on n the degree of a given point has approximately a Poisson distribution with mean value 2c . The number of points having the degree r is thus in this case approximately ( 2 C ) r e - 2c n - ( r = 0 , 1 , . . ) r ? If N ( n ) _ ( n log n ) wn with con - * + - then the probability that the degree of a point will be outside the interval 2 N ( n ) ( 1 - e ) and 2 N ( n ) ( 1 + E ) is ap - ( 2 o ) „ •l ogn ' ke - 2w „ lo g n - O ( 1 j , k - 21ogn . w , 2 , > e . 2logn •w , i k . neYw and thus this probability is o [ 1 1 , for any E > 0 . n 59 Thus the probability that the degrees of not all n points will be between the limit ( 1 ± E ) 2w n log n will be tending to 0 . Thus the assertion of Theorem 10 follows . An interesting question is : what will be the chromatic number of r n , lY ' ? ( The chromatic number Ch ( P ) of a graph r is the least positive integer h such that the vertices of the graph can be coloured by h colours so that no two vertices which are connected by an edge should have the same colour . ) Clearly every tree can be coloured by 2 colours , and thus by Theorem 4a almost surely Ch ( . Tn N ) - 2 if N = o ( n ) . As however the chromatic number of a graph having an equal number of vertices and edges is equal to 2 or 3 according to whether the only cycle contained in such a graph is of even or odd order , it follows from Theorem 5e that almost surely Ch ( I ' n p , ) < 3 for N ( n ) - no with c < IJa • For N ( n ) ti 2 we have almost surely Ch ( Pn tvCn > ) > 3 . As a matter of fact , in the same way , as we proved Theorem 5b , one can prove that r n N ( n ) contains for N ( n ) - 2 almost surely a cycle of odd order . It is an open problem how large Ch ( Pn N ( n ) ) is for N ( a ) - on withc > 1 / 2 ? A further result on the chromatic number can be deduced from our above remark on independent vertices . If a graph T has the chromatic number h , then its points can be divided into h classes , so that no two points of the same class are connected by an edge ; as the largest class has at least n points , h it follows that if f is the maximal number of independent vertices of r we have f > _ n . IVOw we have seen that for N ( n ) = n _ + 2 ( 1 k ) I almost surely h 2 J f < k ; it follows that for N ( n ) = t2 j - o ( . 2 ( 1 k ~ l almost surely Ch ( rn , lY ( n ) ) > 6 0 E RDŐS - RÉNYI Other open problems are the following : for what order of magnitude of N ( n ) has r n , ~ ~ n1 with probability tending to 1 a Hamilton - line ( i . e . a path which passes through all vertices ) resp . in case n is even a factor of degree 1 ( i . e . a set of disjoint edges which contain all vertices ) . An other interesting question is : what is the threshold for the appear - ance of a " topological complete graph of order k " i . e . of k points such that any two of them can be connected by a path and these paths do not inter - sect . For k > 4 we do not know the solution of this question . For k = 4 it follows from Theorem 8a that the threshold is n 2 . It is interesting to compare this with an ( unpublished ) result of G . DIRAC according to which if N > _ 2n : - 2 then GTn , N contains certainly a topological complete graph of order 4 . We hope to return to the above mentioned unsolved questions in an other paper .
