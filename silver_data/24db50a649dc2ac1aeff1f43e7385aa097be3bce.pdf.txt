Squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) of the head and neck region represents a major worldwide health problem , with patients exhibiting a 5 - year survival rate of < 50 % . 2 Com - pared with SCC , PEH lacks pronounced nuclear atypia , abun - dant or abnormal mitosis , and prominent dyskeratosis . 3 How - ever , the histological features of PEH may be similar to well - differentiated SCC and their differential diagnosis may be diffi - cult . 4 E - cadherin is an intercellular homophilic calcium - dependent cell adhesion molecule that plays a critical role in cell adhesion and the suppression of tumor invasion . 5 Loss of E - cadherin ex - pression has been reported in various malignant tumors , includ - ing SCC , and immunohistochemistry for E - cadherin may be a useful tool to differentiate SCC from PEH . 4 Loss of E - cadherin expression may be a promising prognostic marker for SCC of the head and neck region . 6 Cortactin is an F - actin - binding protein that binds and acti - vates the actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex to regulate Expressions of E - cadherin , Cortactin and MMP - 9 in Pseudoepitheliomatous Hyperplasia and Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck : Their Relationships with Clinicopathologic Factors and Prognostic Implication Tack Kune You 1 · Kyoung Min Kim 1 Sang Jae Noh 1 · Jun Sang Bae 1 Kyu Yun Jang 1 , 2 , 3 ·Myoung Ja Chung 1 , 2 , 3 Woo Sung Moon 1 , 2 , 3 Myoung Jae Kang 1 , 3 Dong Geun Lee 1 , 3 · Ho Sung Park 1 , 2 , 3 1 Department of Pathology , Chonbuk National University Medical School , 2 Research Institute for Endocrine Sciences , Chobnuk National University , 3 Research Institute of Clinical Medicine of Chonbuk National University Hospital , Chonbuk National University , Jeonju , Korea Background : E - cadherin , cortactin , and matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) - 9 have roles in tumor development or progression , but their expression has not been fully investigated in pseudoepi - theliomatous hyperplasia ( PEH ) and squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) of the head and neck . Methods : We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of E - cadherin , cortactin , and MMP - 9 in 29 cases of PEH and 97 cases of SCC . Additionally , we evaluated their relationship with clinicopathologic factors and prognostic implications in SCC . Results : Thirty - five cases of SCC showed reduced expression of E - cadherin , whereas none of the PEH did . A total of 20 cas - es and 11 cases of SCC were immunoreactive for cortactin and MMP - 9 , respectively , whereas none of the PEH did . In SCC , reduced expression of E - cadherin was correlated with cortactin ex - pression and invasion depth . Cortactin expression was correlated with differentiation , T classifi - cation , and recurrence and / or metastasis . MMP - 9 expression was correlated with invasion depth . Cortactin expression was correlated with poor overall survival and relapse - free survival and it was an independent prognostic factor . Conclusions : The reduced expression of E - cadherin and the expression of cortactin may be helpful for the differential diagnosis of PEH and SCC . Further - more , cortactin expression in association with reduced E - cadherin expression is correlated with poor prognosis in SCC .

In addition , it has been reported to be an essential regulator of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) secretion and ex - tracellular matrix degradation in invadopodia of head and neck SCC , 9 and its overexpression has been reported in several hu - man cancers of the esophagus , liver , stomach , and breast . 10 - 13 MMPs are a large family of proteases that collectively can de - grade virtually all extracellular matrix components and can reg - ulate the tumor microenvironment by processing substrates in - cluding growth factors and their receptors , cell adhesion mole - cules , cytokines , chemokines , apoptotic ligands , and angiogenic factors . 14 MMP - 9 degrades type IV collagen , which is major component of the basement membrane in human tissues , and allows the tumor cells to escape the site of the primary tumor , leading to invasion and metastasis . 15 An increased concentration of serum MMP - 9 has been detected in many patients with head and neck SCC 16 and MMP - 9 expression has been shown to be a prognostic indicator for shortened survival in patients with head and neck SCC . 17 In addition , overexpression of cortactin may increase extracellular matrix degradation and secretion of MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 , correlated with cortactin expression level . 9 Recent studies of E - cadherin , cortactin , and MMP - 9 have suggested that the proteins play roles in tumor development or progression , although their expressions has not been fully inves - tigated in PEH and SCC of the head and neck region . In this study , we evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of E - cadherin , cortactin , and MMP - 9 in PEH and SCC of the head and neck region and the correlations between cortactin , MMP - 9 , and E - cadherin expression and clinicopathologic factors and their prognostic significance . MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients and tissue samples This study included 29 cases of PEH obtained from mucosal biopsy , 21 cases of SCC from biopsy , and 97 cases of SCC from excision or resection in the head and neck region obtained be - tween June 2000 and December 2008 in Chonbuk National University Hospital . We obtained clinical data as well as sur - vival data from the medical records of PEH and SCC patients . Histologic findings for all cases were reviewed by two authors ( T . K . You and H . S . Park ) , with consensus . We considered a case to be PEH when there was a downward proliferation of epithe - lium characterized by thin , markedly elongated , ananstomosing strands into the submucosa , and heavy infiltration by inflam - matory cells . 4 The individual cells were mature with only occa - sional dyskeratosis . Hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) stained slides of SCC were reviewed and were graded according to the World Health Organization classification . 18 Pathologic staging was reviewed based on the tumor , node , metastasis staging sys - tem of the American Joint Committee on Cancer . 19 SCC pa - tients were grouped according to age , sex , differentiation , inva - sion depth , T classification , perineural invasion , lymphovascular invasion , recurrence and / or metastasis , and stage . The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Institutional Re - view Board of Chonbuk National University Hospital . Immunohistochemical staining and scoring The tissue sections were de - paraffinized and treated in sodi - um citrate buffer ( pH 6 . 0 ) for 10 minutes using a pressure - cooker antigen - retrieval procedure . Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubation with a peroxidase blocker ( Dako , Car - pinteria , CA , USA ) for 10 minutes . Then the tissue sections were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with a mono - clonal anti - cortactin antibody ( 1 : 50 , clone 30 , BD Bioscience , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) and monoclonal anti - E - cadherin ( 1 : 200 , clone 36 , BD Bioscience ) . Another tissue section was in - cubated overnight at 4˚C with a polyclonal anti - MMP - 9 anti - body ( 1 : 100 , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Fremont , CA , USA ) . For the negative controls , sections were treated in the same manner but incubated using Tris - buffered saline without the primary antibody . Reaction products were visualized by im - mersing the section in 3 - amino - 9 - ethyl - carbazole ( AEC ) chro - mogen ( Dako ) , and the samples were counterstained with Mey - er’s hematoxyline . Immunohistochemical analysis was per - formed by consensus of two authors ( T . K . You and H . S . Park ) who were blinded to clinicopathologic information . Immuno - reactivity of E - cadherin , cortactin , and MMP - 9 was evaluated by multiplying the staining intensity and stained area scores . Staining intensity was rated as : weak , 1 ; moderate , 2 ; and strong , 3 . The stained area of E - cadherin was categorized into four groups : negative , 0 ; ≤50 % of cells , 1 ; 51 - 75 % of cells , 2 ; and > 75 % of cells , 3 . 20 The stained area of cortactin was classi - fied into four groups : negative , 0 ; < 25 % of cells , 1 ; 25 - 50 % of cells , 2 ; and > 50 % of cells , 3 . 21 The stained area of MMP - 9 was divided into four groups : negative , 0 ; < 10 % of cells , 1 ; 10 - 50 % of cells , 2 ; > 50 % of cells , 3 . 22 The immunoreactivity of E - cadherin was divided into two groups based on the product of the scores ; a score > 6 was defined as preserved immunoreac - http : / / www . koreanjpathol . org http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 4132 / KoreanJPathol . 2012 . 46 . 4 . 331 E - cadherin , Cortactin , and MMP - 9 in SCC • 333 tivity and a score of 0 - 6 were defined as reduced immunoreac - tivity . The immunoreactivity of cortactin and MMP - 9 was di - vided into two groups in the same manner ; a score of 0 - 3 was defined as negative immunoreactivity and a score ≥4 was de - fined as positive immunoreactivity . Statistical analysis The endpoints of interest were overall survival and relapse - free survival . The endpoint of follow - up was the date of the last contact or the date of death through December 2011 . Overall survival was calculated as the time from diagnosis to the date of death or last contact . Patients who were alive at last contact were censored for overall survival analysis . Relapse - free survival was calculated from the time of diagnosis to the date of recur - rence , metastasis , death , or last contact . Patients who were alive at last contact and who did not have recurrence or metastasis were censored for relapse - free survival analysis . The correlations between clinicopathologic factors and the expressions of E - cad - herin , cortactin , and MMP - 9 were analyzed using Pearson’s χ 2 test . Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards re - gression analyses were performed to estimate the impact of the clinicopathologic factors and the expression of each marker on overall survival and relapse - free survival . Kaplan - Meier survival curves were constructed to further illustrate the impact of over - all survival and relapse - free survival when indicated . SPSS ver . 18 . 0 ( SPSS Inc . , Chicago , IL , USA ) was used for statistical anal - ysis , and p < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant .

All of the PEH cases showed pre - served expression of E - cadherin , whereas 47 . 6 % ( 10 of 21 cases from biopsy ) and 36 . 1 % ( 35 of 97 cases from resection ) of SCC specimens showed reduced E - cadherin expression , respectively ( Table 2 , Fig . 1C , D ) . Compared with PEH , 36 . 2 % of well - dif - ferentiated SCC also showed reduced E - cadherin expression . None of the PEH cases expressed cortactin , whereas 38 . 1 % ( 8 of 21 cases from biopsy ) and 20 . 6 % ( 20 of 97 cases from resec - tion ) of SCC cases expressed cortactin , including 13 . 8 % of well - differentiated SCC cases ( Table 2 , Fig . 1E , F ) . Cortactin was de - tected in the cytoplasm of the SCC cells . None of the PEH cases expressed MMP - 9 , whereas 9 . 5 % ( 2 of 21 cases from biopsy ) and 11 . 3 % ( 11 of 97 cases from resection ) of SCC cases ex - pressed MMP - 9 , including 13 . 8 % of well - differentiated cases ( Table 2 , Fig . 1G , H ) . MMP - 9 was detected in the cytoplasm of the SCC cells . In SCC cases from resection , reduced E - cadherin expression was associated with invasion depth ( p = 0 . 045 ) ( Table 3 ) . Cor - tactin expression was associated with differentiation ( p = 0 . 043 ) , T classification ( p = 0 . 002 ) and recurrence and / or metastasis ( p = 0 . 032 ) ( Table 3 ) . MMP - 9 expression was associated with invasion depth ( p = 0 . 022 ) ( Table 3 ) . However , other clinico - pathologic factors including age , sex , perineural invasion , lym - phovascular invasion , and stage had no association with reduced expression of E - cadherin , expression of cortactin and MMP - 9 . There was an association between reduced E - cadherin expres - sion and cortactin expression ( p = 0 . 028 ) , however neither was associated with MMP - 9 expression ( Table 3 ) . Associations of E - cadherin , cortactin , and MMP - 9 expression with overall survival and relapse - free survival in SCCs Univariate Cox proportional hazard analysis of E - cadherin , cortactin , and MMP - 9 expression and their association with overall survival and relapse - free survival is shown in Table 4 . Perineural invasion ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 2A ) , lymphovascular inva - sion ( p = 0 . 028 ) , recurrence and / or metastasis ( p < 0 . 001 ) , stage ( p = 0 . 008 ) ( Fig . 2B ) , postoperative radiation ( p = 0 . 022 ) , and cortactin expression ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 2C ) predicted shorter overall survival . In addition , perineural invasion ( p = 0 . 027 ) ( Fig . 2D ) , stage ( p = 0 . 002 ) ( Fig . 2E ) , postoperative radiation ( p < 0 . 001 ) , and cortactin expression ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 2F ) pre - dicted shorter relapse - free survival . In addition , the combined expressions of E - cadherin and cortactin was analyzed to evaluate its relationship with overall survival and relapse - free survival . Table 3 .

In this analysis , 94 cases of SCC were divided into three groups : E - cadherin - preserved / cortactin - negative , E - cadherin - reduced / cortactin - negative , and E - cadherin - reduced / cortactin - positive . Cases of E - cadherin - preserved / cortactin - positive SCC were ex - cluded because of their small number . The E - cadherin - reduced / cortactin - positive group had the worst prognosis in overall sur - vival ( p = 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 3A ) and relapse - free survival ( p = 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 3B ) . Multivariate analysis was performed in all 97 cases of SCC patients with complete information for all variables . Variables considered in the analysis were age , sex , stage , postoperative ra - diation , differentiation , perineural invasion , cortactin expres - sion , MMP - 9 expression , and E - cadherin expression . From the multivariate analysis , the independent prognostic factors that were significantly associated with overall survival and relapse - free survival were stage ( p = 0 . 005 and p = 0 . 011 , respectively ) , perineural invasion ( p < 0 . 001 and p = 0 . 010 , respectively ) , and cortactin expression ( p < 0 . 001 and p = 0 . 001 , respectively ) ( Ta - ble 5 ) . In addition , reduced E - cadherin expression ( p = 0 . 002 ) was an independent prognostic factor significantly associated with poor relapse - free survival . DISCUSSION We investigated the immunohistochemical expressions of E - cadherin , cortactin , and MMP - 9 in PEH and SCC specimens of the head and neck region , as well as the correlations between expression of E - cadherin , cortactin , and MMP - 9 and clinico - pathologic factors and their prognostic significance . We found that 1 ) 47 . 6 % of SCCs from biopsy and 36 . 1 % of SCCs from resection showed reduced E - cadherin expression , whereas none of the PEH specimens did , and the reduced preservation of E - cadherin expression was significantly correlated with an inva - sion depth of more than 10 mm ; 2 ) 38 . 1 % of SCCs from biopsy and 20 . 6 % of SCCs from resection expressed cortactin , whereas none of the PEH specimens did , and cortactin expression was significantly correlated with moderate or poor differentiation , advanced T stage ( T3 , 4 ) , and recurrence and / or metastasis ; 3 ) 9 . 5 % of SCCs from biopsy and 11 . 3 % of SCCs from resection expressed MMP - 9 , whereas none of the PEH specimens did , and its expression was significantly correlated with an invasion depth of more than 10 mm ; 4 ) reduced E - cadherin expression was associated with cortactin expression in SCCs of the head and neck region ; 5 ) cortactin expression was associated with http : / / www . koreanjpathol . org http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 4132 / KoreanJPathol . 2012 . 46 . 4 . 331 E - cadherin , Cortactin , and MMP - 9 in SCC • 337 Fig . 2 .

Histologically , PEH does not demonstrate cytological fea - tures of malignancy such as nuclear pleomorphism , maturation atypia , mitosis , and stromal invasion , although it may show re - active atypia . 4 However , it is sometimes extremely difficult to distinguish PEH from SCC , especially from well - differentiated SCC . Moreover , mistaking PEH for SCC may lead to the un - necessary removal of additional tissue or to unnecessary therapy , such as radiation therapy . For this reason , some studies have tried to distinguish PEH from SCC using immunohistochemi - cal markers including E - cadherin ; p53 ; MMP - 1 , - 7 , - 12 , - 13 , and - 19 ; and p16 . 4 , 23 The increased expressions of p53 and MMP - 1 , - 7 , - 12 , and - 13 , and decreased expression of E - cad - herin , p16 , and MMP - 19 has been shown in SCC . 4 , 23 In this study , SCCs from both biopsy and resection showed reduced immunoexpression of E - cadherin and immunoreactivity for cortactin and MMP - 9 , whereas this was not true of the PEH specimens . Moreover , well - differentiated SCCs showed a differ - ent immunoexpression pattern from those of PEH . E - cadherin is a transmembrane molecule that plays an im - portant role in both cell - cell adhesion and cell signal transduc - tion . Decreased expression of E - cadherin has been reported in various malignant tumors including carcinomas of the breast , esophagus , stomach , and colon . Moreover , it has been associated with vascular invasion and poor prognosis in SCCs of the head and neck . 24 Our results showed that reduced expression of E - cadherin is associated with invasion depth and relapse - free sur - vival . In addition , the E - cadherin - reduced / cortactin - positive SCC group had a worse prognosis for overall survival and re - http : / / www . koreanjpathol . org http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 4132 / KoreanJPathol . 2012 . 46 . 4 . 331 E - cadherin , Cortactin , and MMP - 9 in SCC • 339 lapse - free survival than the other two groups . This suggests that reduced expression of E - cadherin may play a role in tumor progression in association with cortactin expression in SCCs of the head and neck . Cortactin contributes to the formation of the adherens junc - tion , which is formed upon homophilic binding of E - cadherin molecules on juxtaposed cells . In MDCK cell monolayers , cor - tactin localizes to E - cadherin - based cell - cell contacts , and cor - tactin is recruited along with the Arp2 / 3 complex to the ex - tending outer margins of cadherin - based lamellipodia . 8 These data indicate that cortactin plays a role in the actin re - organiza - tion required for the formation of stable cadherin - based contact zones . A regulator of Arp 2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization contributes to tumor cell growth and cancer progression . 7 The amplification of cortactin has been reported in 30 % of SCCs in the head and neck region , 25 and it is correlated with metastasis of esophageal SCC and poor prognosis of SCC in the head and neck . 26 , 27 Our results are concordant to those of previous studies in that 20 . 6 % of SCCs expressed cortactin , and its expression was an independent prognostic factor associated with poor over - all survival and relapse - free survival . MMPs are a family of proteolytic enzymes involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix components that play a role in several steps of tumor progression including invasion , angio - genesis , and metastasis . In some studies that investigated the expression of MMPs of SCC in the head and neck , these en - zymes were up - regulated in SCC , and their levels were correlat - ed with tumor invasion , metastases , and patient survival . 28 It has also been reported that MMP - 9 expression is associated with the invasion in SCCs of the esophagus 29 and with poor survival in SCCs of the head and neck . 30 However , in the pres - ent study , MMP - 9 expression was associated with invasion depth only . Moreover , MMP - 9 expression was not associated with other clinicopathologic factors or prognosis . We believe that the different results between the present and others may be due to differences in sample size , methods of scoring criteria , and the antibodies used to evaluate expression . Furthermore , enzymatic activity is more important to proper function than is immunohistochemical expression . More studies are needed to evaluate the correlations between MMP - 9 expression and clini - copathological factors in SCCs of the head and neck region . In conclusion , the expression of E - cadherin , cortactin , and MMP - 9 may play a role in the progression of SCCs in the head and neck region . Moreover , we suggest that the expression of cortactin , which is associated with reduced expression of E - cad - herin , may be a marker for poor prognosis of SCCs in the head and neck region .
