Polarized growth of pollen tubes or root hair cells requires molecule delivery to the growing apex through F - actin . Regulation of the stomatal opening , which is important for plants to adapt to humidity changes , is dependent on F - actin ( Higaki et al . 2010 ) . F - actin also plays important roles in responses against microbial attacks ( Day et al . 2011 ; Higaki et al . 2011 ; Takemoto and Hardham 2004 ) . Numerous actin - binding proteins regulate F - actin organ - ization and dynamics , and thus various cellular and physi - ological functions ( Henty - Ridilla et al . 2013 ; Higaki et al . 2007 ; Huang et al . 2015 ; Sun et al . 2013 ; van Gisbergen and Bezanilla 2013 ) . Actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) is a relatively small ( 13 – 19 kDa ) actin - binding protein that is conserved among eukaryotes . Historically , the first mem - ber of ADF was isolated from the porcine brain and named “cofilin , ” indicating “cofilamentous protein” ( Nishida et al . 1984 ) . Proteins with F - actin depolymerizing activities , including cofilin , were independently identified in several organisms . Sequence analyses later revealed that those pro - teins were related ( Moon and Drubin 1995 ) . For this histor - ical reason , ADF members in yeast and animal models are generally called ADF / cofilin . Although the major function of ADF / cofilin is recognized as severing and depolymeriz - ing F - actin , it can also stabilize F - actin at higher concen - tration and promote nucleation of F - actin at very high con - centration as shown by real - time imaging analysis of single F - actin ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard 2006 ) . In addition to the regulation of F - actin organization and dynamics , other cellular functions of ADF / cofilin have been proposed , such as inducing apoptosis by triggering the release of Ca 2 + from mitochondria , and chaperoning G - actin to the Abstract ACTIN DEPOLYMERIZING FACTOR ( ADF ) is a conserved protein among eukaryotes . The main func - tion of ADF is the severing and depolymerizing filamen - tous actin ( F - actin ) , thus regulating F - actin organization and dynamics and contributing to growth and develop - ment of the organisms . Mammalian genomes contain only a few ADF genes , whereas angiosperm plants have acquired an expanding number of ADF s , resulting in the differentiation of physiological functions . Recent studies have revealed functions of ADFs in plant growth and devel - opment , and various abiotic and biotic stress responses . In biotic stress responses , ADFs are involved in both suscepti - bility and resistance , depending on the pathogens . Further - more , recent studies have highlighted a new role of ADF in the nucleus , possibly in the regulation of gene expression . In this review , I will summarize the current status of plant ADF research and discuss future research directions . Keywords Actin · Actin depolymerizing factor · Plant development · Plant – pathogen interactions · Stress response · Defense signaling Introduction Actin , including both globular ( G ) and filamentous ( F ) , regulates various cellular functions that are necessary for plants to grow and respond to environmental changes . * Noriko Inada norikoi @ bs . naist . jp 1 The Graduate School of Biological Sciences , Nara Institute of Science and Technology , 8916 - 5 Takayama - cho , Ikoma - shi , Nara 630 - 0192 , Japan J Plant Res 1 3 nucleus , where G - actin functions in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin remodeling ( Bernstein and Bam - burg 2010 ) . In plants , the first ADF was isolated from lilies ( Lilium longiflorum ) in a genetic screen for clones that were prefer - entially expressed in anthers ( Kim et al . 1993 ) . Biochemical characterization of plant ADF was first performed with Zea mays ADF3 ( ZmABP3 then renamed as ZmADF3 ) , con - firming its conserved activity to bind both F - and G - actin ( Rozycka et al . 1995 ) . It was also shown that Arabidopsis thaliana ADF1 ( AtADF1 ) increases assembly of F - actin at higher concentration ( Carlier et al . 1997 ) . To date , ADF has been identified in many plants , including moss ( Physcom - itrella patens ) ( Augustine et al . 2008 ) , rice ( Oryza sativa ) ( Huang et al . 2012 ) , and wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) ( Ouel - let et al . 2001 ) . In planta , reduced expression of AtADF1 increased bundling of F - actin , whereas overexpression of AtADF1 reduced bundling ( Dong et al . 2001b ) . Loss of AtADF4 expression reduced severing frequency of F - actin ( Henty et al . 2011 ) . Organisms in animal lineages possess only a few ADF / cofilin variants , whereas plants have acquired an expanded number of ADF s through evolution . For example , mam - mals such as mice ( Mus musculus ) and human ( Homo sapi - ens ) possess three ADF / cofilin members , whereas A . thali - ana and O . sativa have 11 ADF loci ( annotation in rice is referred to Huang et al . 2012 ) , and Populus trichocarpa has 14 ( Roy - Zokan et al . 2015 ) . This expansion of gene number has allowed plant ADF to acquire functional specializations as suggested in many recent reports ( e . g . , Burgos - Rivera et al . 2008 ; Fu et al . 2014 ; Inada et al . 2016 ; Tang et al . 2015 ; Tian et al . 2009 ; Wang et al . 2009b ) . Although the progress of animal ADF / cofilin research has been reviewed extensively ( Bamburg and Bernstein 2010 ; Bamburg and Wiggan 2002 ; Bernstein and Bam - burg 2010 ; Hild et al . 2014 ; Maciver and Hussey 2002 ; Van Troys et al . 2008 ) , there have been no reviews focused on plant ADF to my knowledge . A review by Maciver and Hussey ( 2002 ) included research on plant ADFs , however , significant progress has been made since then . Therefore , in this review , I will summarize the current status of plant ADF research with much emphasis on the importance of ADF as a regulator of plant growth and stress responses . I will use “ADF / cofilin” to refer to animal proteins , and “ADF” for those in plants . Plant ADF variations As described above , angiosperms have acquired an expanded number of ADF genes , which is hypothesized to have derived from a single ADF in P . patens ( Augus - tine et al . 2008 ; Roy - Zokan et al . 2015 ) . These plant ADFs share protein structure with yeast and mammalian ADF / cofilin ( Bowman et al . 2000 , Fig . 1 ) . Residues required for ADF activity and regulation , such as those for actin binding and phosphorylation ( see below ) , have also been conserved in plant ADFs ( Fig . 1 ) . The functional divergence and specialization resulting from this expansion of ADF genes are clearly manifested in differences in tissue - and organ - specific gene expres - sion patterns . For example , among 11 members of A . thaliana ADF s , AtADF1 , − 2 , − 3 , and − 4 , which are clas - sified into subclass I , are expressed throughout the plants Fig . 1 Sequence alignment of ADF . Saccharomyces cereviseae COF1 ( ScCOF1 ) , Homo sapiens COF1 ( HsCOF1 ) , Physcomitrella patens ADF ( PpADF ) , Arabidopsis thaliana ADF1 and ADF7 ( AtADF1 and AtADF7 , respectively ) , and Oryza sativa ADF1 ( OsADF1 ) . Boxes indicate phosphorylation sites , and a black box indicates a nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) . Although angio - sperm ADFs lack conventional NLS , their nuclear localization has been confirmed . Shaded residues indicate phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate binding sites ( Zhao et al . 2010 ) , and residues indi - cated as bold characters are actin - binding sites ( Dong et al . 2013 ) J Plant Res 1 3 at relatively high levels , whereas AtADF7 and AtADF10 , which belong to subclass IIa , are expressed only in flowers , particularly in pollens . Another subclass of ADF s , AtADF8 and AtADF11 in subclass IIb , showed specific expression in root epidermal cells . Although both subclass III and subclass IV showed expression in a wide variety of tis - sues , the restricted expression of subclass III AtADF5 and AtADF9 in root apical meristem is not seen with subclass IV AtADF6 ( Ruzicka et al . 2007 ) . The distinct expression patterns of AtADF1 ( subclass I ) , AtADF5 ( subclass III ) and AtADF6 ( subclass IV ) were also observed by Dong et al . ( 2001a ) , in which the restricted expression of AtADF5 in root apical meristem was clearly noted . In rice , OsADF2 , − 4 , and − 5 are expressed throughout the plant , whereas OsADF9 and − 10 show specific expression in spikelets , and OsADF1 and − 8 show high expressions in spikelets and are also expressed in other organs . OsADF3 and − 11 are expressed throughout plants , except for roots . Promoter - GUS analysis also revealed the vascular specific expression of OsADF1 and − 3 ( Huang et al . 2012 ) . In addition to variations in expression patterns , biochem - ical activity also varies among ADFs . Particularly , it has been noted that pollen ADFs have structural and biochemi - cal characters different than vegetative ADFs . The antibody raised against pollen - specific ADF did not cross - react with vegetative ADFs ( Allwood et al . 2002 ; Smertenko et al . 2001 ) . Pollen - specific LlADF1 exhibited much lower activ - ity in actin depolymerization than maize ZmADF3 , which is expressed in vegetative organs ( Smertenko et al . 2001 ) . Accordingly , pollen - specific AtADF7 is less efficient at dis - assembling F - actin than vegetative AtADF1 ( Zheng et al . 2013 ) . Although ADFs are commonly regulated by phos - phorylation , as described later , pollen - specific LlADF1 seems to be exceptional ( Allwood et al . 2002 ) . Further differences have been seen in microscope images of the intracellular localization of pollen - specific ADFs . Vegeta - tive ADFs exhibit nucleoplasmic localization in addition to co - localization with F - actin ( Dong et al . 2013 ; Inada et al . 2016 ; Ruzicka et al . 2007 ; Tholl et al . 2011 ; Tian et al . 2009 ) , whereas both immunostaining analysis and expres - sion of fluorescent protein - tagged ADFs have shown the absence of pollen - specific ADFs in the nucleus ( Allwood et al . 2002 ; Smertenko et al . 2001 ) . The differentiation of physiological function has also been reported for ADFs . Purified AtADF9 shows strong F - actin bundling activity , whereas AtADF1 exhibits clas - sical ADF activity in F - actin destabilization ( Tholl et al . 2011 ) . The loss of AtADF9 expression causes early flower - ing phenotypes , which are not complemented with the con - stitutive expression of distant AtADF4 or AtADF8 ( Burgos - Rivera et al . 2008 ) . Transient expression of AtADF1 , − 5 , − 6 , − 7 , and − 10 ( referred as AtADF12 in the paper ) , but not that of AtADF2 , − 3 , − 4 , and − 9 , inhibits the resistance of barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) against powdery mildew fun - gus Blumeria graminis f . sp . hordei ( Miklis et al . 2007 ) . Overexpression of AtADF6 , but not that of AtADF5 , inhib - its the transport of RPW8 . 2 - YFP , a resistant protein for powdery mildew fungi , to the membrane surrounding spe - cialized infection hyphae , haustoria ( Wang et al . 2009b ) . These differences in cellular function could be caused by differences in biochemical activity or regulatory mecha - nisms of ADFs , however , the underlying mechanisms remain unknown . Transcriptional regulation of ADF Characterized angiosperm ADF s show well conserved gene structures , comprising three exons , including a very short 1st exon . As represented by the gene structure of A . thaliana 11 ADF members ( Fig . 2 ) , ADF s of angiosperms , including petunia ( Petunia hybrid ) ( Mun et al . 2002 ) and rice ( Huang et al . 2012 ) , possess a very short 1st exon that contains only start codons , which is followed by a long 1st intron in most cases . Notably , mammalian ADF / cofilin sequences also have a short 1st exon ( Maciver and Hussey 2002 ; Thirion et al . 2001 ) , whereas P . patens ADF do not possess introns ( Augustine et al . 2008 ) . The long 1st intron ( 1659 bp ) of petunia ADF ( PhADF1 ) functions in enhancing expression of PhADF1 ( Mun et al . 2002 ) . When the GUS gene was fused to the 1 . 7 kb upstream region of PhADF1 and expressed in A . thaliana , GUS expression was only seen in the vascular area , whereas a construct containing PhADF1 1 . 7 kb promoter - 1st intron - GUS showed strong GUS activity throughout the plant . Notably , when the PhADF1 genomic region from the 1 . 7 - kb native promoter to the 2nd intron was fused upstream of GUS , the transgenic plant showed much lower expression levels than plants expressing PhADF1 promoter - 1st intron - GUS , suggesting that PhADF1 introns function differently in the regulation of gene expression ( Mun et al . 2002 ) . The enhancement of gene expression by the 1st intron is con - served in another member of petunia ADF , PhADF2 , as well as in AtADF1 ( Jeong et al . 2007 ) . In addition , insert - ing the PhADF1 1st intron can alter both expression level and pattern of other genes . A . thaliana profilin 5 ( PRF5 ) normally expresses only in reproductive organs . Insertion of the PhADF1 1st intron between the 1st exon of PRF5 and GUS gene results in PRF 5 expression throughout the plant . Owing to the high A / T composition , no meaningful conserved sequences were found in these ADF 1st intron sequences ( Jeong et al . 2007 ) ; thus , the regulatory mecha - nisms remain unknown . The structure of the promoter region has been exam - ined in petunia and rice . For petunia PhADF1 , several potential transcription factor - binding sites and hormone J Plant Res 1 3 response domains were found in the upstream region of the gene body ( Mun et al . 2002 ) . Huang et al . ( 2012 ) per - formed comprehensive analyses on the promoter structure and expression pattern of all the 11 rice ADF s and found the presence of stress - related cis - acting elements , includ - ing ABA - responsive element , dehydration - responsive element / C - repeat , and low - temperature responsive element in the 1 - kb promoter regions . Accordingly , the expression of some OsADF s is induced by stresses such as low tem - perature , drought , ABA , and salt ( Huang et al . 2012 ) . The alternative splicing of ADF / cofilin that pro - duces variations in both the ADF / cofilin sequence and function has been reported in human ( Thirion et al . 2001 ) and Caenorhabditis elegans ( McKim et al . 1994 ; Ono and Benian 1998 ; Ono et al . 2008 ) . The A . thali - ana database ( TAIR , http : / / www . arabidopsis . org / ) indi - cated that AtADF1 , − 3 , − 4 , and − 5 have splicing vari - ants . For AtADF1 ( At3g46010 ) , which has a 139 amino acid long At3g46010 . 1 variant and 150 amino acid long At3g46010 . 2 variant , the sequence of At3g46010 . 1 has been identified in the A . thaliana EST database ( Dong et al . 2001a ) , and its biochemical activity has been ana - lyzed ( Dong and Hong 2013 ; Dong et al . 2013 ) . How - ever , At3g46010 . 2 , which has an additional 11 residues following the start codon , has not been characterized and it is not known whether the two variants differ in expres - sion pattern or activity in F - actin depolymerization . Fig . 2 Gene structure of the Arabidopsis thaliana ADF fam - ily . Black boxes indicate exons . All 11 members of AtADF s comprise three exons , and the 1st exons contain either a single ( only start codon ) or a couple of amino acids . The 1st exon is followed by a long 1st intron in many AtADF s J Plant Res 1 3 Regulation of ADF activity The activity of ADF / cofilin in animal models is post - tran - scriptionally regulated by many factors , including environ - mental pH and phosphorylation . Interactions with 14 - 3 - 3 protein , phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) , and actin - interacting protein ( AIP ) also affect the activity of ADF / cofilin ( Bernstein and Bamburg 2010 ) . These regulatory factors are well conserved in plants . Regarding the pH dependency of ADF activity , plant ADFs , such as those in wheat ( TaADF ) ( Ouellet et al . 2001 ) , tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum , NtADF1 ) ( Chen et al . 2002 ) , lily ( LlADF1 ) , and maize ( ZmADF3 ) ( Allwood et al . 2002 ) , show high activity in binding to F - actin at pH 6 . 5 , whereas they bind to G - actin more efficiently at pH 8 . 0 , similarly to ADF / cofilin in animal models . This pH - dependent change in ADF / cofilin activity is possibly caused by the pH - dependent conformational changes of actin ( Blondin et al . 2002 ) . Other factors known to regulate activities of plant ADFs are summarized below . Phosphorylation Phosphorylation of serine ( Ser ) at the N - terminus is a con - served regulatory mechanism of ADF activity in F - actin disassembly . Upon phosphorylation , ADF becomes inacti - vated and loses its F - actin - binding ability ( Blanchoin et al . 2000 ; Ressad et al . 1998 ) . In animals , this serine is located at the 3rd amino acid of ADF / cofilin , whereas many plant ADFs have the 6th serine ( S6 ) phosphorylated ( Fig . 1 ) . This S6 phosphorylation of plant ADFs was first shown with ZmADF3 . A phosphomimetic mutation at S6 made ZmADF3 lose its ability to bind F - or G - actin ( Smertenko et al . 1998 ) . Microscopic observation also confirmed the loss of the F - actin - binding ability of plant ADFs by phos - phorylation . Porter et al . ( 2012 ) produced A . thaliana plants stably overexpressing a coding sequence of AtADF4 conju - gated with green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) and found that the co - localization of AtADF4 - GFP with F - actin was dis - rupted when a phosphomimetic mutation was incorporated at S6 of AtADF4 ( Porter et al . 2012 ) . Similarly , phosphom - imetic AtADF1 that was conjugated to GFP and transiently expressed in onion peels lost its filamentous localization pattern ( Dong and Hong 2013 ) . However , this reduction in co - localization with F - actin by the incorporation of a phos - phomimetic mutation was not reproduced in another study that used transgenic plants stably expressing the genomic region of AtADF4 containing a 1 . 5 - kb native promoter , exons , introns , and 3 ′ UTR ( Inada et al . 2016 ) . Biochemical analysis needs to be performed using those plants express - ing the mutant form of ADFs to conclusively determine the relationship between the phosphostatus of ADF and its intracellular localization . In animal systems , both kinases and phosphatases regu - lating the phosphostatus of ADF / cofilin were identified and well characterized ( Bernstein and Bamburg 2010 ; Mizuno 2013 ) . In plants , several candidate ADF kinases have been reported . Calcium - dependent protein kinase ( CDPK ) pos - sibly phosphorylates ZmADF3 ( Smertenko et al . 2001 ) and was partially purified ( Allwood et al . 2001 ) . How - ever , chelating Ca 2 + by EGTA does not abolish ZmADF3 phosphorylation , thus other factor ( s ) can also function in ZmADF3 phosphorylation ( Smertenko et al . 1998 ) . An in vitro assay using purified proteins showed that AtCDPK6 phosphorylates AtADF1 ( At3g46010 . 1 ) at S6 . Induced expression of AtCDPK6 increased F - actin bundling in planta , a phenotype similar to that of Atadf1 , indicating the function of AtCDPK6 in the suppression of ADF activ - ity ( Dong and Hong 2013 ) . Meanwhile , a 52 - kD kinase that requires Mn 2 + for its activity , which is a property of plant receptor - like protein kinases , was identified to phos - phorylate wheat TaADF ( Ouellet et al . 2001 ) . Recently , A . thaliana CASEIN KINASE1 - LIKE PROTEIN2 ( CKL2 ) was identified to regulate activities of subclass I AtADFs ( AtADF1 , −2 , −3 , and −4 ) and stomatal closure upon ABA treatment or drought ( Zhao et al . 2016 ) . Knockout mutant ckl2 is unable to close stomata under ABA treatment or drought stress , and this phenotype is partially suppressed by Atadf4 . CKL2 physically interacts with and phosphoryl - ates subclass I AtADFs . It will be of interest to determine whether CKL2 regulates the functions of AtADF in other pathways , such as pathogen responses ( Inada et al . 2016 ; Porter et al . 2012 , see below ) . Although phosphorylation is an important regulatory mechanism of ADF activity in F - actin disassembly , its importance in ADF function may vary depending on the variants or physiological events that ADF is involved in . In P . patens , which has a single ADF in the genome , phospho - regulation of ADF is essential for cell growth , because both phosphodeficient and phosphomimetic mutants of PpADF expression only partially complement the effect caused by the loss of PpADF expression ( Augustine et al . 2008 ) . Similarly , neither phosphodeficient nor phosphomimetic mutants of AtADF4 complement the enhanced resistance against powdery mildew disease in Atadf4 ( Inada et al . 2016 , see below ) . On the other hand , the phosphomimetic mutant of AtADF4 did complement the Atadf4 susceptible phenotype against bacterial pathogens ( Porter et al . 2012 ) . Furthermore , the F - actin - binding activity of ZmADF3 was inhibited by the incorporation of a phosphomimetic muta - tion , whereas its activity on F - actin disassembly was not ( Smertenko et al . 1998 ) . In addition to S6 , tyrosine 68 ( T68 ) is also a residue that is commonly phosphorylated in mammalian , chicken J Plant Res 1 3 ( Gallus gallus ) , and Xenopus cofilin , but is not present in mammalian or chicken ADF ( Bernstein and Bamburg 2010 ) . Upon phosphorylation of T68 , ubiquitination and degradation of cofilin is increased ; therefore regulating the level of cofilin protein ( Yoo et al . 2010 ) . This tyrosine residue is conserved in some plant ADFs ( Fig . 1 ) , although there have been no reports to date showing the phospho - rylation of ADF tyrosine residue or ubiquitination of plant ADFs . Phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate Phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) is an estab - lished regulator of mammalian ADF / cofilin , and upon the binding of PIP 2 , the ADF / cofilin activity is inhibited ( Bern - stein and Bamburg 2010 ) . The only example of PIP 2 regu - lation on plant ADF is shown with ZmADF3 . Biochemical analysis showed that the activity of recombinant ZmADF3 on F - actin depolymerization was inhibited by both PIP 2 and phosphatidylinositol 4 - monophosphate ( PIP ) ( Gunga - bissoon et al . 1998 ) . ADF / cofilin interacts with PIP 2 through a large , posi - tively charged surface , consisting of lysine ( K ) and arginine ( R ) ( Zhao et al . 2010 ) . These K – R clusters are conserved in plant ADFs ( Fig . 1 ) , indicating the conservation of the PIP 2 regulation of plant ADFs . 14 - 3 - 3 proteins 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , which were named after their particular elution and migration patterns on two - dimensional DEAE cellulose chromatography and starch gel electrophoresis , are present in all eukaryotic organisms including plants . 14 - 3 - 3 proteins act as phosphosensors , monitoring the phosphostatus of a specific site , and translating the infor - mation into a change in the activity of the target protein . In plants , 14 - 3 - 3 proteins are involved in various aspects of plant physiology including biotic responses ( Lozano - Duran and Robatzek 2015 ) . In mammals , 14 - 3 - 3ζ binds and stabi - lizes phosphorylated ADF / cofilin , thus negatively regulat - ing the ADF / cofilin activity of severing and depolymeriz - ing F - actin ( Gohla and Bokoch 2002 ) . Arabidopsis thaliana 14 - 3 - 3λ interacts with AtADF1 and regulates F - actin organization in vivo ( Zhao et al . 2015 ) . However , contrary to what is expected from animal 14 - 3 - 3 that stabilizes phosphorylated ADF / cofilin thus sup - presses F - actin depolymerizing activity of ADF / cofilin , a knockout mutant of 14 - 3 - 3λ exhibited an elongated hypoc - otyl phenotype , similarly to Atadf1 and Atadf4 . Authors also observed that a 14 - 3 - 3λ loss - of - mutant increased the phosphorylation level of AtADF1 thus hindered the proper localization of AtADF1 to F - actin ( Zhao et al . 2015 ) . Therefore , the regulatory mechanism of ADF by 14 - 3 - 3 may differ between animals and plants . As ADF phospho - rylation is an important component of the regulation by 14 - 3 - 3 , it is necessary to understand the entire mechanism , in which both kinase and 14 - 3 - 3 are involved , to reveal the regulatory mechanisms of ADF function . Actin - interacting protein Actin - interacting protein ( AIP ) is a conserved WD - repeat protein , which is required for efficient disassembly of F - actin by ADF / cofilin ( Ono et al . 2004 ) . Recently , it was demonstrated that AIP1 severs F - actin that is fully deco - rated with ADF / cofilin , possibly by competing with ADF / cofilin in F - actin binding , thus lowering the concentration of ADF / cofilin , which promotes F - actin severing by ADF / cofilin ( Chen et al . 2015 ; Gressin et al . 2015 ) . Several papers have described a conserved role of plant AIP in promoting ADF - mediated F - actin disassembly . Allwood et al . ( 2002 ) identified interaction between A . thaliana AIP1 and lily LlADF1 using the yeast two hybrid assay and co - immunostaining analysis . They also per - formed an in vitro assay and demonstrated that A . thali - ana AIP1 promotes F - actin depolymerization by LlADF1 ( Allwood et al . 2002 ) . Two AIP1 genes are encoded in the A . thaliana genome , and suppression of AIP1 expression impairs the growth and development of plants and induces increased bundling of F - actin , which is a phenotype seen in adf mutants ( Ketelaar et al . 2004 ) . Overexpression of AtAIP1 reduces F - actin bundling and induces swollen root hairs ( Ketelaar et al . 2007 ) . Knockout of P . patens AIP1 , which is encoded by a single gene in the genome , causes severe defects in the tip growth , which is partially rescued by PpADF expression . F - actin in the P . patens aip1 mutant was more static and slower in remodeling than that in wild type moss , thus providing support that moss AIP functions in F - actin regulation through ADF ( Augustine et al . 2011 ) . Shi et al . ( 2013 ) showed that rice AIP1 ( OsAIP1 ) could promote ADF activity in severing and depolymer - izing F - actin by an in vitro assay . In vivo , a knockdown of OsAIP1 promotes , whereas its overexpression inhibits , F - actin assembly . Co - sedimentation analysis showed the enhancement of F - actin disassembly by OsAIP1 only in the presence of ADF . The increase in frequency of in vivo F - actin severing by OsAIP1 in the presence of ADF was also confirmed by observation with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) , by which the organi - zation and movement of F - actin at the cell surface can be visualized at high resolution , thus confirming the role of OsAIP in regulating F - actin dynamics ( Shi et al . 2013 ) . J Plant Res 1 3 Function of ADF in plant development and growth ADF controls cell elongation via the regulation of F - actin organization , thus contributes to plant growth . The knock - down of PpADF suppresses the tip growth of moss ( Augus - tine et al . 2008 ) , whereas the reduction of single ADF expression in angiosperms often exhibits cell elongation . Cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum ) ADF1 ( GhADF1 ) expresses abundantly in fiber cells , and GhADF1 downregulation alters the cell wall morphology and elongates length of fiber cells ( Wang et al . 2009a ) . Knockdown of AtADF1 signifi - cantly elongates organ length , such as that of cotyledons , hypocotyls , roots , and stems , whereas over - expression sig - nificantly shortens their lengths ( Dong et al . 2001b ) . The effect of AtADF1 overexpression on the elongation of dark - grown hypocotyl is suppressed by the introduction of muta - tions in the actin - binding domain of AtADF1 ( Dong et al . 2013 ) . The loss of AtADF4 expression also causes hypoco - tyl elongation when grown in the dark ( Henty et al . 2011 ) , but shortens the root hairs in the standard growth condition with light ( Inada et al . 2016 ) . Therefore , ADF regulates cell elongation differently depending on tissues . Organ morphology is also affected by altered ADF expression . AtADF1 overexpression causes wavy hypocot - yls ( Dong et al . 2001b ) , and Atadf4 exhibits wavy and flat - tened mature leaves , which is not observed in Atadf1 or Atadf3 ( Inada et al . 2016 ) . However , as this phenotype in leaf shape was more strongly manifested in plants in which expressions of all of subclass I AtADF s were suppressed , other members of subclass I AtADFs , AtADF1 , −2 , and −3 , possibly contribute to the regulation of leaf shape redundantly ( Inada et al . 2016 ) . The alteration in leaf shape is also reported with induced AtADF2 knockdown plants ( Clement et al . 2009 ) . Ethanol - inducible AtADF2 RNAi plants exhibited more serration of leaves at the circumfer - ence . In addition , ectopic appearance of lateral roots , and small , shrunken , and bent siliques that contained less fertile seeds were observed ( Clement et al . 2009 ) . Although leaf serration and phenotypes of lateral root and silique were not observed in subclass I AtADF s knockdown lines ( Inada et al . 2016 ) , this difference in phenotypes could be due to difference in the level of AtADF2 expression suppression . The role of ADF in regulating flowering timing has been indicated in two reports . The downregulation of AtADF1 expression significantly delayed the timing of flowering , whereas plants overexpressing AtADF1 flowered with tim - ing similar to that of the wild type ( Dong et al . 2001b ) . AtADF9 expresses at relatively low levels in seedlings and mature tissues , but at very high level in the callus ( Ruzicka et al . 2007 ) . The knockout mutant Atadf9 shows delayed growth and early flowering ( Burgos - Rivera et al . 2008 ) . This early flowering phenotype is correlated with a lower expression of FLC and higher expression of other flowering - related genes such as CO and LFY in Atadf9 ( Burgos - Rivera et al . 2008 ) . As mentioned above , this early flowering phenotype of Atadf9 was not complemented with AtADF4 or AtADF8 expression , which is correlated with the results that Atadf4 showed no changes in flowering tim - ing ( Inada et al . 2016 ) . Thus , AtADFs functionally differ - entiate regarding the regulation of flowering timing . Function of ADF in plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses The acquisition of multiple ADF genes in angiosperm line - ages has made it possible for plant ADFs to obtain a role in responses to both abiotic and biotic stresses , as emphasized in recent studies . Function of ADF in abiotic stresses Many papers reported increased protein accumulation or gene expression of ADF , particularly ADFs of grasses , when plants are subjected to various abiotic stresses . Drought stress induced accumulation of OsADF in leaves of rice seedlings ( cv . CT9993 and IR62266 ) ( Sale - kdeh et al . 2002 ) and accumulation of OsADF2 expression in the rice variety Azucena ( Yang et al . 2003 ) . OsADF3 accumulates in the sheath of the cultivars Nipponbare and Zhonghua 8 during drought and osmotic stresses , but not during cold or salt stresses ( Ali and Komatsu 2006 ; Huang et al . 2012 ) . On the contrary , in roots , salt stress induces OsADF3 accumulation in Nipponbare ( Huang et al . 2012 ; Yan et al . 2005 ) , indicating a tissue - specific function of OsADF3 . In a cDNA library of smooth cordgrass ( Spartina alterniflora ) , which is a halophyte that is capable of tolerat - ing salinity as high as double that of sea water , the gene expression of ADF is induced when plants are subjected to salinity stress ( Baisakh et al . 2008 ) . ADF could also be involved in the tolerance to both high - and low - temperature stresses . Smooth cordgrass ADF was induced under heat stress ( Baisakh and Subudhi 2009 ) . The expression level of OsADF3 in anthers is higher in heat - tolerant cultivars than less tolerant ones ( Gonzalez - Schain et al . 2016 ) . However , wheat ADF ( TaADF ) has been identified as a gene of which expression is rapidly and strongly upregulated during low temperatures ( Dany - luk et al . 1996 ) . TaADF accumulates at higher levels when wheat plants are subjected to low temperatures . The accu - mulation of TaADF is much higher in freezing - tolerant cultivars than less tolerant ones , thus suggesting its role in cold acclimation ( Ouellet et al . 2001 ) . The exogenous application of the plant hormone , absci - sic acid ( ABA ) , induces swelling , root hair formation , and J Plant Res 1 3 initiation of lateral root primordia in tips of young semi - nal rice roots . Proteomic analysis revealed that two ADFs of rice ( Taichung native 1 ) , called as ADF - 1 and - 2 in the paper , accumulate in response to ABA application . These OsADFs exhibit the same amino acid sequences ; thus , are possibly the same protein of phosphorylated or dephospho - rylated form ( Chen et al . 2006 ) . This ABA - induced OsADF was later identified as OsADF3 ( Huang et al . 2012 ) . ABA , but not salicylic acid , jasmonic acid , and ethylene , induces TaADF3 expression . The induction of TaADF3 expression was also seen during drought and cold stresses , but not salt stress or wounding ( Tang et al . 2015 ) . The only example for the functional indication of ADFs during abiotic stresses is from a study of OsADF3 overexpressed in A . thaliana . OsADF3 overexpressing A . thaliana plants became more tolerant against both drought and osmotic stresses ( Huang et al . 2012 ) . Further genetic studies are necessary to clarify the role of ADF in abiotic stresses in the future . Function of ADF in biotic stresses The role of plant ADFs in interactions with pathogenic microbes , including nematodes , bacteria , viruses , and fungi , in both compatible ( results in pathogen growth and proliferation ) and incompatible ( results in arrest of patho - gen growth and often in plant cell death ) interactions , has been recently highlighted in many reports . Generally , ADF positively regulates plant susceptibility in compatible inter - actions and plant resistance in incompatible interactions , although there are exceptions . In a compatible interaction with nematodes , A . thaliana ADF2 acts as a positive regulator to establish the interac - tion , i . e . , helps the nematode infecting the host plant . The root knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita forms giant cells in infected host roots , where the dynamic reorganiza - tion of host F - actin is observed ( de Almeida Engler et al . 2004 ) . Clement et al . ( 2009 ) found that AtADF2 gene expression is increased in cells containing giant cells . Transgenic plants with reduced AtADF2 expression exhibit severely delayed maturation of giant cells and signifi - cantly reduced egg production , which are correlated with increased bundling of F - actin in giant cells in AtADF2 knockdown plants ( Clement et al . 2009 ) . In an incompatible interaction with the bacterial patho - gen , Pseudomonas syringae pv . tomato ( Pst ) DC3000 har - boring the avirulent protein AvrPphB , A . thaliana ADF4 plays a role in host resistance . The knockout mutant of AtADF4 shows increased susceptibility against Pst DC3000 AvrPphB , but not against lines carrying AvrRps2 or AvrB ( Tian et al . 2009 ) . This increased susceptibility is corre - lated with reduced RPS5 expression , a gene responsible for resistance against Pst DC3000 AvrPphB ( Porter et al . 2012 ) . Soybean mosaic virus ( SMV ) establishes a compatible interaction with the soybean ( Glycine max ) , and SMV P3 , a protein with unknown function , interacts with soybean ADF2 . This P3 - GmADF2 interaction was shown in a yeast two hybrid assay and bimolecular fluorescent complemen - tation assay . As SMV P3 possibly functions in virus rep - lication , systemic infection , pathogenicity , overcoming resistance , and cell - to - cell movement , the authors sug - gested that the interaction between P3 and GmADF2 could facilitate the cell - to - cell movement of P3 ( Lu et al . 2015 ) . The functions of ADFs in both compatible and incom - patible interactions with fungi are highlighted in many reports . In an incompatible interaction with stem rust Puc - cinia graminis f . sp . tritici race QCCJ , barley rpg4 - medi - ated resistance locus 1 ( RMRL1 ) mediates a resistance against this fungus . This locus contains HvRga1 , Rpg5 , and HvAdf3 , although suppression of HvAdf3 expression alone did not induce resistance against P . graminis ( Wang et al . 2013 ) . In an incompatible interaction with P . strii - formis f . sp . tritici CYR23 , the ADF7 expression of the wheat genotype Suwon 11 ( TaADF7 ) was sharply elevated , whereas an infection by compatible CYR31 caused much smaller changes in TaADF7 expression . Reduced expres - sion of TaADF7 caused increased susceptibility to CYR23 ( Fu et al . 2014 ) . On the other hand , TaADF3 functions in an opposite manner in interactions with P . striiformis f . sp . tritici . The expression of TaADF3 is downregulated by incompatible CYR23 , but upregulated by compatible CYR31 . The suppression of TaADF3 expression enhances resistance to both incompatible CYR23 and compatible CYR31 , and impedes both fungal entry and haustoria for - mation of CYR31 ( Tang et al . 2015 ) . In addition , we recently reported a function of A . thali - ana subclass I ADFs , particularly AtADF4 , in a contribu - tion to the susceptibility against compatible powdery mil - dew fungus , Golovinomyces orontii ( Inada et al . 2016 ) . We found that the knockout mutant of Atadf4 shows signifi - cantly enhanced resistance against G . orontii . The altered susceptibility is not observed in Atadf1 , whereas Atadf3 shows enhanced yellowing , which is a sign of enhanced immune response , at later infection stages . Transgenic plants in which the expression of all of four subclass I ADF s is suppressed ( ADF1 - 4Ri ) exhibit even more enhanced resistance against G . orontii and no visually noticeable mycelium formation at 2 weeks post inoculation , indicat - ing the functional redundancy among subclass I ADFs in response to G . orontii . This increased resistance against G . orontii in Atadf4 and ADF1 - 4Ri is correlated with the infected cell - specific accumulation of reactive oxygen spe - cies and cell death , which are mediated by both salicylic acid and jasmonic acid . From this prominently enhanced J Plant Res 1 3 resistance of Atadf4 and ADF1 - 4Ri , significant reorganiza - tion of F - actin in those mutants and transgenic plants was expected . However , we observed no changes in F - actin organization in uninfected Atadf4 and ADF1 - 4Ri , and only a transient increase in F - actin density in infected ADF1 - 4Ri cells at a very early infection stage . These unexpected results prompted us to examine another function of ADF in the nucleus . An expression of a construct containing an AtADF4 genomic sequence fused to GFP and a nuclear exporting signal revealed the importance of nuclear locali - zation of AtADF4 in the A . thaliana – G . orontii interaction , suggesting an unconventional role of AtADF4 ( Inada et al . 2016 , further discussed below ) . Perspective As summarized above , ADF is involved in many aspects of plant physiology . Particularly , as plant ADFs can func - tion in resistance to various abiotic and biotic stresses , the achievements obtained from plant ADF research could be translated into applications , such as a production of stress - tolerant plants . For future plant ADF research , I would like to propose two major issues that need to be resolved . 1 . Elucidation of regulatory mechanism of plant ADF : although the cellular function of plant ADF in regulat - ing F - actin organization and dynamics has been well characterized by biochemical analyses and observation of in vivo F - actin organization or dynamics in the pres - ence or absence of ADF , the regulatory mechanism of plant ADF activity remains elusive . Recently , CKL2 was identified as a kinase of A . thaliana subclass I ADF in regulating stomatal opening ( Zhao et al . 2016 ) ; however , it remains unknown whether the same kinase regulates the other functions of ADF , such as those in pathogen responses . Plant ADF phosphatases have not been identified . In addition , there are only a few exam - ples regarding regulation of plant ADF by 14 - 3 - 3 , PIP 2 or AIP . ADF regulatory factors can possibly regulate event - specific function of ADF , thus could be a target of modification to produce stress tolerant plants . There - fore , more efforts should be paid to understand the plant ADF regulatory pathway in the future . Forward genetic analysis to isolate mutants that either revert or aggravate adf phenotypes as well as proteomic analyses of ADF - interacting partners will contribute to the iden - tification of the ADF regulatory factors thus clarify the regulatory mechanism of ADF . 2 . Understanding the mechanism of gene expression reg - ulation by ADF : in addition to the conventional role of ADF in the destabilization of F - actin at the cell sur - face , the role of plant ADF in regulating gene expres - sion has been repeatedly suggested . In a knockout mutant of AtADF9 , which shows a reduction in plant size and early flowering under long day conditions , the expression level of genes related to flowering , such as FLOWERING LOCUS C , is altered ( Burgos - Rivera et al . 2008 ) ; the increased susceptibility of Atadf4 against the bacterial pathogen Pst DC3000 AvrPphB is correlated with a significant reduction in expressions of RPS5 , a resistance gene required for the recognition of AvrPphB , and FRK1 , a marker of innate immunity , in response to Pst DC3000 AvrPphB infection ( Porter et al . 2012 ) ; in plant – powdery mildew fungus interac - tion , ADF1 - 4Ri exhibited significantly higher levels of PR1 expression , even in uninfected leaves ( Inada et al . 2016 ) . In the case of plant – powdery mildew fungus interactions , the importance of nuclear localization of ADF has also been shown . Furthermore , in papers describing the role of ADF in plant – pathogen interac - tions , a correlation between changes in F - actin organi - zation and plant phenotypes caused by ADF loss is often not shown or is unclear . For example , an arrange - ment of F - actin in mesophyll cells , the main site of attack by P . striiformis f . sp . tritici , was not altered in plants with reduced TaADF3 expression and enhanced resistance against this fungus ( Tang et al . 2015 ) . Therefore , this unconventional role of ADF could play an important role in regulating a wider range of plant physiology . There have been a couple of implications for the mech - anism of ADF / cofilin in regulation of transcription and gene expression . Nishida et al . reported that DMSO or heat shock treatment induces cofilin - dependent for - mation of nuclear actin rods and speculated that cofi - lin regulates the amount of available G - actin through the formation of actin rods ( Nishida et al . 1987 ) . As G - actin is a component of RNA polymerase and nuclear remodeling complex and thus functions in regulating transcription and gene expression ( Zheng et al . 2009 ) , ADF / cofilin could contribute to the regu - lation of transcription and gene expression through the formation of actin rods . The formation of nuclear actin rods that contain ZmADF3 is also observed in maize roots treated with cytochalasin ( Jiang et al . 1997 ) . More recently , mouse cofilin - 1 was shown to form a complex with actin and RNA polymerase II ( pol II ) and to play a key role in pol II transcription ( Obrdlik and Percipalle 2011 ) , although the functional form of pol II - associated actin is not known . In addition to J Plant Res 1 3 G - actin , nuclear F - actin has also emerged as a regula - tor of various nuclear events including transcription and gene expression ( Belin and Mullins 2013 ) . ADF / cofilin could affect transcription and gene expression through its function in regulation of the nuclear F - actin structure , although the mechanism that nuclear F - actin regulates transcription and gene expression is still unclear . To elucidate the nuclear function of ADF , multifac - eted approach including imaging analysis of dynamic nuclear structures such as nuclear F - actin ( Baarlink et al . 2013 ) and actin rods , biochemical analysis to identify interaction partners of nuclear ADF followed by genetic analysis of the function of identified pro - teins , detailed examination how altered ADF expres - sion affect gene expression and chromatin structure should be performed . In summary , further studies on plant ADFs will not only contribute to understanding of plant physiology , but also greatly contribute to basic cell biology .
