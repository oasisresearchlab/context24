Data - driven techniques can increasingly enable the retrieval of inspirational stimuli based on non - text - based representations , beyond semantic features of stimuli . However , there is a lack of fundamental understanding regarding how humans evaluate similarity between non - semantic design stimuli ( e . g . , visual ) . Toward this aim , this work examines human - evaluated and computationally derived representations of visual and functional similarities of 3D - model parts . A study was conducted where participants ( n = 36 ) assessed triplet ratings of parts and categorized these parts into groups . Similarity is defined by distances within embedding spaces constructed using triplet ratings and deep - learning methods , representing human and computational representations . Distances between stimuli that are grouped together ( or not ) are determined to understand how various methods and criteria used to define non - text - based similarity align with perceptions of ‘near’ and ‘far’ . Distinct boundaries in computed distances separating stimuli that are ‘too far’ were observed , which include farther stimuli when modeling visual vs . functional attributes .

Inspirational stimuli may also lead to undesirable outcomes such as design ﬁxation ( Jansson and Smith , 1991 ) , thus requiring the thoughtful selection of stimuli presented to designers . Consider - ation of stimulus selection is especially relevant when derived from large datasets , increasingly used when applying data - driven design methods ( Jiang et al . , 2022 ) . In a recent review on data - driven design - by - analogy ( DbA ) , Jiang et al . identify analogical distance between source and target domains as the most widely studied factor impacting this process . To retrieve stimuli with varying analogical distances to a given design problem or designer speciﬁed input , similarity relationships need to be computed . For instance , text - based processing has been used by Fu et al . ( 2013 ) to deﬁne contextual similar - ity between patents . Semantic networks include the Technology Semantic Network ( TechNet ) , which uses unsupervised learning and natural - language - processing ( NLP ) techniques to retrieve and relate technology - based knowledge from patent texts ( Sarica et al . , 2021 ) . However , beyond utilizing stimuli represented by textual information , there is increasing interest in using 2D - image and 3D - model datasets to support multi - modal analogy for design inspiration ( Jiang et al . , 2022 ) . Zhang and Jin ( 2021 ) used an unsupervised deep - learning model to construct a latent space for a dataset of sketches . Jiang et al . ( 2021 ) constructed a convolutional neural network - based model to derive a vector space where feature vectors embed visual and technology - related informa - tion from patent images . Kim and Maher ( 2023 ) developed a co - creative artiﬁcial intelligence ( AI ) partner that provides inspirational sketches related by visual and conceptual similarity to designers’ sketches . The eﬀects of providing sketches with varying levels of visual and conceptual similarity to the designer’s sketch were investigated ( Kim and Maher , 2023 ) . Visually similar sketches with low conceptual similarity were associated with higher quality ideation . However , visual similarity was not examined in isolation from conceptual similarity . In prior work from our team , deep neural networks modeling visual and functional relationships between 3D - model parts were used to develop a multi - modal search platform for inspiration discovery ( Kwon et al . , 2022a ) . Findings across two subsequent user studies involving this system revealed that , when searching for stimuli in terms of appearance and function - based similarities to a speciﬁed input , designers frequently encountered results they did not expect ( Kwon et al . , 2023 ) . Insights from this prior work motivate the aim of the present study . Speciﬁcally , to deepen our under - standing of the deﬁnition and evaluation of non - text - based measures of similarity , which have not been widely studied in interactive settings . Currently , there is a gap in knowledge regarding how relation - ships deﬁned in terms of non - textual properties of inspirational stimuli align with human perceptions and expectations . Increased availability , interest , and use of 2D - image and 3D - model datasets support the development of tools enabling discovery of design stimuli related to an input by non - text - based fea - tures rather than semantic distances . Evaluations of human and AI - based representations of visual and functional similarity are compared in this work through the two synergystic research questions : • ( RQ1 ) How do evaluations of human and AI - based representations of non - text - based similarities of inspirational stimuli compare ? • ( RQ2 ) How does the evaluation of non - text - based similarities compare when considering visual vs . functional attributes of inspirational stimuli ? These research questions are studied within the context of using 3D - model parts as a source of design relevant inspiration , which contain both visual and functional information . Findings from a categoriza - tion task are analyzed in which stimuli are organized based on visual and functional similarity ( n = 36 ) . This study uses the categorization of stimuli to evaluate similarities computed in terms of human vs . AI - based representations and visual vs . functional similarity . Low levels of similarity are expected to align with diﬀerent - group categorization and vice versa . Leveraging the notion of “near” and “far” , typ - ically attributed to conceptual distances ( e . g . , ( Fu et al . , 2013 ) ) , “near” distances are associated with same - group categorization and “far” with diﬀerent - group categorization . Understanding how similar - ity in terms of non - textual information is assessed can support the retrieval of relevant and impactful sources of inspiration for designers . 1726 ICED23 2 METHODS This work investigates how humans evaluate visual and functional similarities between 3D - model parts . Similarity is represented by distances between stimuli in embedding spaces derived using two approaches . The ﬁrst approach uses deep learning to construct neural networks to model these relation - ships , resulting in computational embedding spaces for a large dataset of 3D - model parts ( developed in prior work by Kwon et al . ( 2022a ) ) . Presented in the current work , the second approach uses human - evaluated similarities of a selection of 3D - model parts to build psychological embedding spaces of stimuli . In Sec . 2 . 1 , the study conducted and steps taken in order to develop psychological embed - ding spaces for both visual and functional similarity are outlined . The analytical approach presented in Sec . 2 . 2 is followed to quantify how the perception of similarity between stimuli in terms of their mutual categorization can be related to measures of similarity , as deﬁned within these two embedding spaces . 2 . 1 Experimental design A human subjects study ( n = 36 ) was conducted , consisting of two main tasks : a triplet rating task and a categorization task , each completed twice ( for visual and functional similarity , separately ) . For one sim - ilarity type , participants completed 25 trials of the triplet rating task followed by the categorization task . The same two tasks were then repeated for the other stimulus set . The order of presentation was coun - terbalanced across participants . To determine which stimuli to present in these tasks , two distinct sets of 16 3D - model parts were selected from the computational embedding spaces with varying pairwise distances in either visual and functional similarity . 2 . 1 . 1 Participants For this study , 36 participants ( 13 female , 22 male , 1 non - binary ) were recruited including 14 graduate students , 12 undergraduate students , and 6 industry professionals ( with < 1 to 9 years of experience ) . In prior work from the authors , any impact of expertise when engaging with inspirational stimuli was in their utilization in a structured design task ( not relevant to the current study ) ( Kwon et al . , 2022b ) . No particular level of engineering design knowledge or experience was required . Participants were recruited via email from among current students in Mechanical Engineering and those who previously completed research studies related to engineering design . Compensation of $ 10 was provided for completion of the 30 min . study . This human subjects research study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of California , Berkeley . 2 . 1 . 2 Computationally derived stimulus sets The stimulus sets provided to participants in the triplet rating and categorization tasks were selected by considering distances between 3D - model parts in the deep - learning - based computational embedding spaces . These neural networks were trained on 573 , 585 part instances belonging to 26 , 671 3D - model object assemblies across 24 object categories . To encode similarity of 3D - model parts by visual appear - ance , the deep - learning model takes 2D snapshots from various angles of each part to understand its geometric and physical form . The functional network is developed by considering neighboring parts within a part’s respective object assembly such that two parts are similar if they share similar neighbors ( e . g . , a chair leg and back are functionally similar because a chair seat is a common neighbor ) . The development of these neural networks is fully described in our past work ( Kwon et al . , 2022a ) . While components of common objects may provide limited inspiration , prior work utilizing these stimuli in a 3D - modeling design task demonstrated that they could be useful for uncovering new and unexpected features to designers’ ideas ( Kwon et al . , 2022b , 2023 ) . Euclidean distances between parts in the computational embedding spaces are used to represent how similar ( low distance ) or dissimilar ( high distance ) parts are . Given the size and diversity of the full dataset , candidate stimuli were restricted to “chair” and “table” object categories , speciﬁcally consid - ering chair seats , chair backs , and tabletops ( as labelled within the PartNet dataset ( Mo et al . , 2019 ) ) , resulting in 2043 possible parts . This constraint was imposed to reduce the potential diﬃculty of rat - ing similarity between and categorizing very diverse objects ( e . g . , bottles and tables ) . Although task complexity is reduced as a result , ultimately , the aim of this selection of stimuli was to encourage the assessment of similarity in terms of visual and functional features only . This aim could be better achieved without the inﬂuence of semantic information , including product category . The full 16 - part ICED23 1727 stimulus sets selected to present in the triplet rating and categorization tasks are shown in Fig . 1 . While distance between neighbors is not constant , neighboring parts ( e . g . , 1 and 2 ) are always nearer in terms of pairwise distance than non - neighboring parts ( e . g . , 1 and 5 ) . By maintaining consistency in pairwise distances , we ensure that the stimulus sets contain a diversity of distances , where all parts belong to both low and high distance pairs . Figure 1 . Stimulus set used when assessing ( a ) visual similarity and ( b ) functional similarity between parts in triplet rating and categorization tasks . 2 . 1 . 3 Human - evaluated similarities of stimuli Developing a psychological embedding space that models human representations of a given stimulus set requires the collection of many trials of human judgments . A common task used to elicit these judgments is a triplet rating task where one of two options is selected as being more similar to a given reference . Prior work by Nandy and Goucher - Lambert ( 2022 ) and Ahmed et al . ( 2019 ) have used triplet similarity ratings to generate embedding spaces for human representations of design stimuli . Preceding each triplet rating task of 25 trials , participants were told that “In the [ ﬁrst / second ] section of this study , you will consider the [ function / appearance ] of parts when assessing similarity” . At the beginning of each trial , participants were asked to “Select the option with the most similar part in [ function / appearance ] to the reference part” with two options presented , such as in the example shown in Fig . 2 . Participants were instructed to make this selection based on the red - highlighted 3D - model part in the object assembly . When considering functional similarity , participants were told to consider the object the red part belongs to , other neighboring parts in the object , and that parts with high functional similarity may be used in the same object and / or neighbor similar parts . For visual similarity trials , no further detail was provided . Figure 2 . Example triplet of 3D - model parts shown to participants . 1728 ICED23 For the number of parts in each stimulus set ( 16 ) , a total of 1680 unique triplet trials are possible . Ahmed et al . ( 2019 ) recommend that a minimum of 30 % of the full stimulus set is needed to construct a robust embedding space of human representations . In our study , 36 participants completed 25 triplet ratings for each stimulus set . Due to data collection errors and exclusion of data from one participant who failed the attention check for the visual similarity triplet rating task , a total of 801 trials for visual similarity and 826 trials for functional similarity were included , constituting 48 % and 49 % of all potential trials . 2 . 1 . 4 Categorization of stimuli Following the triplet rating task , participants provided a short written response to describe the criteria used to evaluate visual or functional similarity between parts . A categorization task was next conducted for the same stimulus set ( presented unordered ) . Rather than allow participants to freely group parts , two diﬀerent criteria were speciﬁed to consider for each similarity type . Participants were instructed to examine the ( 1 ) shape ( e . g . , geometry ) and ( 2 ) size ( e . g . , thickness ) of a part when categorizing parts by visual similarity . The ( 1 ) object the reference part belongs to and ( 2 ) neighboring parts to the reference part were criteria speciﬁed when categorizing parts by functional similarity . These criteria were selected based on knowledge of the part features learned by the computationally derived neural networks as well as the similarity evaluation criteria participants provided in pilot testing . For each stimulus set , participants constructed two sets of 3 or 4 categories for the speciﬁed criteria . By associat - ing computed similarities derived by the previously speciﬁed methods and criteria with categorization outcomes , insight into how similarities are evaluated can be gained . 2 . 2 De(cid:2)nition and evaluation of similarities between stimuli Using the similarity assessments obtained in the triplet rating tasks , a psychological embedding space was constructed for each stimulus set to model human representations of parts , as described in Sec . 2 . 2 . 1 . Similarity between parts is represented by their embedding - space distances . The relationship between similarity and categorization was then used to gain insight into how computed similarities between stimuli are evaluated , as described in Sec . 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 1 Construction of psychological embedding spaces Using the triplet rating task observations , psychological embedding spaces were constructed , which each include two layers : an embedding layer representing multidimensional features , and a similarity kernel . The Python library PsiZ was used to generate these models , which speciﬁcally handles behavioral data such as triplet ratings to infer psychological representations ( https : / / github . com / psiz - org / psiz ) . The sim - ilarity kernel consists of a distance function ( weighted Minkowski distance ) and a similarity function ( exponential decay in similarity with increased distance ) . The use of this two - component kernel is moti - vated by psychological theory and has been used to successfully represent psychological embeddings ( Roads and Mozer , 2019 ) . The number of dimensions to use for each model was determined by training models with dimensions between two and ten and selecting the highest value at which validation set ( 10 % of trials ) losses stopped improving . The ﬁnal psychological embedding spaces for both visual and functional similarity are two dimensional . 2 . 2 . 2 Relationship between similarity and categorization of parts To represent similarity between pairs , the process conceptualized in the example in Fig . 3 was followed . First , the Euclidean distances between all 120 pairs of parts in both the psychological and compu - tationally derived embedding spaces were computed and ordered by decreasing distance . Measuring similarity in terms of Euclidean distances implies symmetry in pairwise relationships that may not always be appropriate to maintain , as explored by Chaudhari et al . ( 2019 ) . However , in the context of 3D - shape retrieval for the properties of similarity explored , symmetric distance - based measures are considered suitable ( Tangelder and Veltkamp , 2004 ) . Lower distance between parts is used to represent higher similarity , and vice versa . According to pairwise embedding - space distances , pairs were assigned a similarity level between 1 and 5 , where each level contains 24 pairs . Lower levels were assigned to high distance , and thus low similarity , pairs ( such as 5 and 15 in the example ) and higher levels to low distance , high similarity pairs ( such as 5 and 9 in the example ) . As described in Sec . 2 . 1 . 4 , each participant created three to four categories to organize stimuli in terms of given criteria . Based on these categories , every unique pair of parts ( 120 in total ) was associated ICED23 1729 Figure 3 . Conceptual overview of process used to assign similarity levels to pairs of parts by ordered pairwise distances . Each similarity level ( 1 - 5 ) was assigned to 24 / 120 part pairs . with an outcome of either being grouped together or separately . Each pair of parts was also assigned to a similarity level ( 1 - 5 ) consisting of 24 pairs in total . For each participant , the proportion of pairs in each similarity level categorized into diﬀerent groups was computed . The mean proportion across participants was then found for each similarity level . Signiﬁcantly above chance group means ( where the lower limit of the 95 % conﬁdence interval is greater than 50 % ) indicate diﬀerent - group categorization of pairs of parts with the speciﬁed similarity level . Using the notion of “near” and “far” prevalent in DbA ( e . g . , Chan et al . ( 2015 ) ) , above chance diﬀerent - group categorization is used to distinguish the boundary between similarity levels at which stimuli may be evaluated as “too far” . Analogously , stimuli with a similarity level associated with below chance diﬀerent - group categorization ( i . e . , same - group categorization ) may be “too near” to be relevant . We propose that in between these similarity levels lies the “sweet spot” referred to by Fu et al . ( 2013 ) in inspirational stimuli avoiding these extremes . A similar approach was used by Cooke et al . ( 2007 ) to model the relationship between similarity and categorization of 3D objects . The boundary separating parts that are “too far” is expected to be observed at low similarity levels , corresponding to parts separated by greater distances within the embedding spaces , while stimuli perceived as “too near” are expected to be related by high levels of similarity . 3 RESULTS Using the approach outlined in Sec . 2 . 2 . 2 , the relationship between the similarity and categorization of parts is explored . RQ1 and RQ2 are addressed by comparing how the categorization of parts with vary - ing similarities diﬀers when similarities are obtained from computational or psychological embedding spaces and deﬁne visual or functional similarity . Represented in Fig . 4 , mean proportions of pairs cat - egorized in diﬀerent groups are shown for each level of visual and functional similarity between parts . The computational and psychological similarity levels of a pair of parts are plotted separately and are assigned based on the pairwise distances between the parts in each embedding space . High - distance pairs are associated with low similarity levels ( 1 ) while low - distance pairs have high similarity lev - els ( 5 ) . Mean proportion values and associated 95 % conﬁdence intervals are also detailed in Table 1 . Above chance ( 50 % ) average proportions represent that participants did not categorize pairs with the speciﬁed level of similarity together . Proportions are plotted with error bars of 95 % conﬁdence intervals to determine whether same or diﬀerent group categorization of pairs with the speciﬁed similarity level is statistically signiﬁcant . Conﬁdence interval limits that do not cross the 50 % threshold are bolded in Table 1 to indicate signiﬁcant proportions of same or diﬀerent group categorization . 3 . 1 Categorization of visually similar inspirational stimuli The categorization of stimuli related by visual similarity is ﬁrst examined . When evaluating based on shape ( Fig . 4a ) , parts with similarity levels up to 2 and 3 in terms of psychological and computational embedding space distances , respectively , are categorized in diﬀerent groups above chance . Psycholog - ical boundaries in Fig . 4a show humans may consider pairs with similarity levels up to 2 to be “too far” . 1730 ICED23 Figure 4 .

For parts categorized based on size ( Fig . 4b ) , the same diﬀerence between human and AI - based representations is found where pairs with a similarity level of 1 in the psychological embedding space and up to level 2 in the computational embed - ding space may be “too far” . Diﬀerences between human and AI evaluations of similarity are discussed in Sec . 4 . 1 . The “farther” boundary in size vs . shape suggests that size is a less discriminating factor when evaluating visual similarity . Combining both categorization criteria , stimuli sharing similarity up ICED23 1731 to level 3 are not grouped together and are thus associated with being “too far” . These stimuli represent 20 - 60 % of all pairs that may be discounted as being too visually dissimilar to be relevant , with humans associating greater visual dissimilarity ( lower similarity levels ) with diﬀerent group categorization . 3 . 2 Categorization of functionally similar inspirational stimuli The relationship between categorization and functional similarity is also determined . Across both crite - ria used to categorize functional similarity , the most similar pairs in the psychological embedding space ( level 5 ) are placed in diﬀerent categories below chance ( or , in the same categories above chance ) . High similarity pairs in this context are evaluated as “too near” or too obviously related to be relevant . This ﬁnding , which is not observed with high levels of computationally determined similarity , may reveal that these criteria align with how participants made their similarity judgments . For categories made based on the object a part belongs to ( Fig . 4c ) , diﬀerences were observed based on how similarities between parts were derived . For computationally derived similarities , pairs with similarity levels of 1 and 2 , the 40 % least similar pairs , are considered “too far” . Based on psychological embedding space distances , pairs of stimuli with similarity levels up to 3 are “too far” , including 60 % of all pairs . Also notable is the steep dropoﬀ between the mean proportion of pairs that are grouped in diﬀerent categories with psychological similarity levels of 3 ( 0 . 93 ) compared to 4 ( 0 . 40 ) . The boundary separating parts that are “too far” to categorize together by neighboring parts ( Fig . 4d ) is between similarity levels 2 - 3 and 3 - 4 in computational and psychological embedding space distances , respectively . Across both cat - egorization criteria , stimuli that are “too far” to be grouped together constitute 40 - 60 % of pairs . These boundaries are “nearer” than observed when categorizing by visual similarity . Parts do not need to be as far in functional as in visual similarity to be divided into separate groups . The opposite relationship between human and AI evaluations of functional vs . visual similarity is found where more similar pairs in terms of human than AI - based representations are categorized separately . Diﬀerences in human vs . AI evaluations and visual vs . functional similarity are further discussed in Sec . 4 . 1 and 4 . 2 . 4 DISCUSSION In general , the results presented demonstrate that across deﬁnitions of pairwise similarities ( human - evaluated and computationally derived ) and criteria for categorization ( form and function - based features ) , increasing similarity between pairs is consistently associated with decreasing proportions of pairs categorized in diﬀerent groups . “Near” and “far” are used to describe similarity levels associated with stimuli that are categorized together and separately . Based on the present ﬁndings , the evaluations of diﬀerent measures of similarities are impacted by various factors discussed in this section . 4 . 1 Comparing evaluation of human and computational representations of similarity Through RQ1 , a comparison of the perception of computationally derived and human - evaluated similar - ities was sought . Results from four categorization tasks were used to determine whether the placement of stimuli into the same or diﬀerent groups aligned with these similarity measures . Boundaries between similarity levels of pairs of stimuli associated with diﬀerent - group categorization were observed . Com - paring human and AI - evaluated similarities , AI - based boundaries were “nearer” when categorizing by visual similarity , but “farther” when categorizing by functional similarity . Parts need to be less visu - ally similar according to psychological than computational similarities and less functionally similar according to computational than psychological similarities to be categorized separately . Visual features considered by AI may be less obvious to humans ( e . g . , shapes at diﬀerent angles ) , which can explain the increased separation of parts with higher levels of computationally derived similarities . Regarding functional similarity , this diﬀerence reﬂects that in the triplet rating tasks participants may have rated parts as more functionally similar if they belonged to the same object type . This ﬁnding is in line with the presence of three distinct object categories ( 4 / 16 chair backs , 9 / 16 chair seats , and 4 / 16 tabletops ) in the functional similarity stimulus set . By contrast , the computationally derived functional embedding space does not incorporate semantic knowledge of individual parts and their associated object assem - blies , thus similar objects may share low functional similarity . It is possible that by introducing more complex and diverse stimuli , the use of object - related criteria to categorize stimuli by functional sim - ilarity may be less relevant to investigate and further diﬀerences may be observed when other criteria are considered . This emphasizes that it is important for computational methods to develop relationships 1732 ICED23 between inspirational stimuli that agree with human representations . These ﬁndings suggest that these representations are dependent on the stimuli considered ( e . g . , object diversity within the stimulus set ) . 4 . 2 Comparing evaluation of visual and functional similarity Addressing RQ2 , the evaluations of visual and functional similarity are compared . Distinct boundaries dividing stimuli that are “too far” were observed , where boundaries identiﬁed for functional similarity are “nearer” than those found for visual similarity and include more similar parts as “too far” . When considering visual similarity between parts , the top 20 - 60 % least similar pairs are found to be “too far” to categorize together , while these boundaries lie between the top 40 - 60 % of least similar pairs when categorizing by functional similarity . One reason for this diﬀerence may be that , when evaluating visual similarity , multiple visual features may be easily analyzed simultaneously ( e . g . , parts should have the same shape and thickness ) . If multiple criteria are used to determine visual similarity through triplet comparisons , but categorization is performed for one criteria at a time ( shape or size ) , less similar pairs ( as assessed in the triplet rating task ) may be similar enough to group together . It is notable that under evaluation of these non - text - based similarities , up to 60 % of stimulus pairs are found to be “too far” . Deﬁnitions of “far” applied in prior work to retrieve conceptually related analogies tend to be more extreme , constituting crowd - sourced ideas occurring once or examples in the 10th percentile of text - based similarities to a design challenge ( Goucher - Lambert and Cagan , 2019 ; Chan et al . , 2015 ) . Taken together , one level of similarity at which stimuli are “too far” may not exist for all sets of design stimuli or deﬁnitions of similarity . 4 . 3 Limitations and future work It is important to note that the interpretation of these results is limited to the speciﬁc stimulus sets pre - sented and the similarity types assessed by participants . While selected to reduce the diﬃculty of this study and present exploratory ﬁndings on evaluation of non - text - based similarities , the reduced diver - sity and complexity of stimuli chosen limit the current results . As well , although the tasks conducted were not explicitly design relevant , design experience of participants may impact their judgments of relationships between the shown stimuli . Furthering this study , future work is encouraged to investigate additional sources of inspirational stimuli containing multi - modal information from which to extract and deﬁne non - text - based similarities and study in a design context . By gaining more knowledge regarding how these similarities are perceived and evaluated , new sources of inspiration can be eﬀectively engaged with and utilized by designers . 5 CONCLUSION This work investigates similarities based on non - textual features of inspirational stimuli , represented by distances in computational and psychological embedding spaces derived using deep learning and human - evaluated similarity assessments . Through a categorization task , similarity levels between stim - uli that were categorized together or separated were associated with distances considered “near” and “far” . Boundaries separating stimuli that are “too far” were observed , which include stimuli that were not grouped together at above chance levels . For similarities derived from psychological and com - putational embedding spaces , diﬀerences in the boundaries separating stimuli that are “too far” were observed . Human vs . AI - based boundaries are “farther” in visual similarity but “nearer” in functional similarity . Comparing across similarity types , the boundaries for stimuli that are “too far” in functional similarity are “nearer” than for visual similarity , implying that functionally related stimuli do not need to be as dissimilar as visually related stimuli to be “too far” . Thus , depending on the type of similarity criteria involved , computed distances between stimuli have diﬀerent implications with respect to per - ceptions of “near” and “far” . Overall , this work presents an exploration of less explored , increasingly relevant , deﬁnitions of similarity of inspirational stimuli based on form and function - based attributes .
