Kurth , 1984 , J . Biol . Chem . 259 : 7480 - 7487 ) . Chromatography of actin and gelsolin mixtures in EGTA - containing solutions isolates a stable binary complex , GA1Cal ( Kurth , M . , and J . Bryan , 1984 , J . Biol . Chem . 259 : 7473 - 7479 ) . The effects of platelet gelsolin and the binary gelsolin - actin complex on the depolymerization kinetics of rabbit skeletal muscle actin were studied by diluting pyrenyl F - actin into gelsolin or complex - containing buffers ; a decrease in fluorescence repre - sents disassembly of filaments . Dilution of F - actin to below the critical concentration required for filament assembly gave a biphasic depolymerization curve with both fast and slow components . Dilution into buffers containing gelsolin , as GCa2 , increased the rate of depoly - merization and gave a first order decay . The rate of decrease in fluorescence was found to be gelsolin concentration dependent . Electron microscopy of samples taken shortly after dilution into GCa2 showed a marked reduction in filament length consistent with filament severing and an increase in the number of ends . Conversely , occupancy of the EGTA - stable actin - binding site by an actin monomer eliminated the severing activity . Dilution of F - actin into the gelsolin - actin complex , either as GA1Cal or GA ~ Ca2 , resulted in a decrease in the rate of depolymerization that was consistent with filament end capping . This result indicates that the EGTA - stable binding site is required and must be unoccupied for filament severing to occur . The effectiveness of gelsolin , GCa2 , in causing filament depolymerization was dependent upon the ionic conditions : in KCI , actin filaments appeared to be more stable and less susceptible to gelsolin , whereas in Mg ~ + , actin filaments were more easily fragmented . Finally , a comparison of the number of kinetically active ends generated when filaments were diluted into gelsolin versus the number formed when gelsolin can function as a nucleation site suggests that gelsolin may sever more than once . The data are consistent with a mechanism where gelsolin , with both actin - binding sites unoccupied , can sever but not cap F - actin . Occupancy of the EGTA - stable binding site yields a gelsolin - actin complex that can no longer sever filaments , but can cap filament ends . In nonmuscle cells the assembly of actin filaments from monomeric actin is thought to be a highly reversible reaction . A theory describing actin polymerization in vitro has been developed by Oosawa and Asakura ( 31 ) and extended by Wegner and collaborators ( 39 - 41 ) . According to this theory , actin monomers interact to form small aggregates that can serve as centers for filament growth . When a sufficient num - ber of intermolecular bonds form in an aggregate , whose size is estimated at three monomers ( 12 , 34 ) , growth is favored over dissociation , and elongation proceeds at both ends of the growing filament ( 2 , 10 , 32 ) until a steady - state is reached . Depolymerization occurs from the polymers and would be favored by dilution . Polymer depolymerization has been stud - ied by Purich and co - workers ( 22 , 25 ) who have developed a kinetic model for predicting the shape of depolymerization curves after dilution from initial polymer length distributions . The initial rates of depolymerization are proportional to the number concentration of polymer ends , and the shape of the 1236 THE JOURNAL Or - CELL BIOLOGY .

In vitro studies on actin assembly suggest that in nonmuscle cells the regulation of actin polymerization must be tightly controlled by various types of actin - associated proteins ( 23 , 38 ) . The analysis of depolymerization kinetics is a useful method to study accessory proteins suspected to change the number of kinetically active ends , for example , by severing filaments and / or by capping filament ends . This group in - dudes Acanthamoeba capping protein ( 21 ) , villin ( 5 , 13 , 17 , 30 ) , fragmin ( 20 ) , severin ( 6 , 16 ) , actin depolymerizing factor ( 9 , 19 ) , brain actin depolymerizing factor ( 1 ) , and gelsolin ( 36 , 42 ) . The severing and capping activities of several of these proteins are modulated by calcium . Gelsolin , a 90 , 000 - mol - wt protein , was originally isolated from macrophages by Yin and Stossel ( 42 ) who proposed a severing function for this protein . Wang and Bryan ( 36 ) described a 90 , 000 - mol - wt protein in platelets that would nucleate G - actin assembly , cap the barbed end of heavy meromyosin - decorated filaments , and reduce the viscosity of F - actin solutions . Immunologic studies have shown that these proteins are related ( 27 , 43 ) . Both macrophage and platelet gelsolins bind two atoms of calcium with a Ka of ~ 106 M - j . The interaction between gelsolin and actin was initially thought to be freely reversible depending on the free Ca 2÷ concentration . More recently we have shown that gelsolin has two actin - binding sites that are quite different ( 8 ) . Gelsolin ( G ) will bind with one actin ( A ) and one Ca 2÷ to form a 1 : I : 1 complex , GA1Cal , which is relatively stable in EGTA . For example , Kurth and Bryan ( 26 ) have shown that a 4 ~ Ca2 * - labeled complex can be isolated and is stable in EGTA and high salt for weeks . A ternary complex , GA2Ca2 , can also be isolated ( 26 ) by centrifugation or gel filtration if Ca 2÷ is present . The second Ca z÷ is easily removed , however , and GA2Cal is not sufficiently stable that it can be isolated by centrifugation or gel filtration , although we have estimated this binding constant at ~ 30 nM ( 26 ) . In this paper , we have used pyrenyl actin , originally re - ported by Kouyama and Mihashi ( 24 ) , as a sensitive fluores - cent probe for actin polymerization , to study the effects of gelsolin and the gelsolin - actin complex on dilution - induced filament depolymerization . Walsh et al . ( 35 ) have used this methodology to study filament severing and capping by villin and have shown that villin in 200 ~ M Ca 2÷ caps the preferred end , severs filaments , and increases the number of nonpre° ferred ends available for disassembly . Depletion of Ca 2÷ results in rapid uncapping of the villin - blocked preferred ends and hence , more rapid depolymerization . We can define solution conditions in which we have pre - dominately one of the following four species ; G , GCa2 , GAjCa ~ , or GA ~ Ca > For example , in 1 mM EGTA , pH 7 . 5 , gelsolin will be in the unliganded form , whereas in 0 . 1 mM CaC12 the predominant species will be GCa2 . Similar consid - erations hold for GA , Ca ~ and GA ~ Ca2 . Using these condi - tions , we have found that the gelsolin - actin complexes , but not GCa2 , act to cap the preferred end of actin filaments . There are quantitative differences between the capping activ - ity of GA , Ca , and GA ~ Ca2 . GCa2 on the other hand appears to sever actin filaments at a rate proportional to the gelsolin concentration . How effective GCa2 is in causing filament depolymerization is dependent upon the ionic conditions : in KCI , actin filaments appear more stable and difficult for gelsolin to fragment , whereas in MgC12 , filaments are more easily severed . Finally , we have compared the number of kineticaUy active ends generated when filaments are diluted into gelsolin with the number generated when G - actin is assembled in the presence of gelsolin . The results suggest that gelsolin may sever actin filaments more than once . MATERIALS AND METHODS Actin Purification and Labeling : Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle by the method of Spudich and Watt ( 33 ) and gel - filtered on Sephadex G - 150 following the procedures outlined by MacLean - Fletcher and Pollard ( 29 ) . Actin concentrations were determined using an extinction coeffi - cient of 0 . 65 at 290 nm for 1 mg / ml . Pyrene - labeled actin was prepared as follows : G - actin , before the G - 150 gel - filtration step , was dialyzed versus 0 . 2 mM CaCI2 , 0 . 5 mM ATP , 2 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 ( G - buftkr ) , to remove the mercaptoethanol used during the extraction step . The G - actin was diluted to a final concentration of 40 I ~ M . Pyrene iodoacetamide ( Molecular Probes , Junc - tion City , OR ) , freshly dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide , was added from a 5 - mM stock to a final concentration of 45 ~ tM . This was added dropwise to a rapidly stirring actin solution to minimize precipitation of the pyrene iodoacetamide . KCI and MgCI2 were added to 100 and 2 mM , respectively , and the actin was allowed to polymerize for 12 - 18 h at room temperature in the dark . The pyrene - F - actin was collected by centrifugation at 100 , 000 g for 3 h , resuspended at - I0 mg / ml , then depolymerized by dialysis against G - buffer plus 1 mM sodium azide . Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100 , 000 g for 3 h , and the G - actin superuatant was chromatographed on a G - 150 column equilibrated with G - buffer plus 1 mM sodium azide . Actin monomers eluted as a slightly skewed peak . The most concentrated fractions were collected and pooled . For immediate use , the G - actin was stored on ice with 0 . 5 mM ATP added . Alternatively , 0 . 5 - 1 . 0 - ml aliquots of pyrenyI G - actin were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at - 80 * ( 2 . Before use , this actin was thawed quickly in a water bath and held on ice for 3 - 6 h . The assembly and disassembly characteristics of the gel - filtered actin stored on ice , measured as rates and extents of assembly , are identical to that of the protein frozen in liquid nitrogen then thawed . The protein concentration for pyrene - actin was determined as outlined by Cooper et al . ( 11 ) . After the optical density ( OD ) at 344 nm and 290 nm was determined , the total actin was calculated using mM actin = ( OD29o - 0 . 127 OD3 ~ , ~ ) / 26 . 6 mM - 1 cm - L The pyrene / actin ratio was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 22 , 000 M - ~ cm - ' for pyrene with pyrene / actin = ( OD3 ~ / 22 . 0 ) / mM actin . The labeling ratios were between 0 . 65 and 0 . 95 , but never greater than 1 . 0 . In the dilution experiments described here , we have used the pyrene - actin without dilution with unlabeled actin to have sufficient signal - to - noise to follow the depolymerization process . The OD per 1 # M pyrenyl F - actin at 365 nm was ~ 0 . 001 I . Inner filter effects were not a problem at the concentrations used in the dilution experiments . Fluorescence data were taken with an Aminco SPF - 500 spectrofluorometer ( American Instrument Co . , Silver Springs , MD ) in the ratio mode . The exci - tation wavelength was 365 nm , and the emission wavelength was 407 nm . The temperature was 25 " C . Unless specified , the data are plotted as arbitrary relative fluorescence values . The data have not been normalized . We use a tetraphen - ylbutadiene standard , at ~ 0 . 1 # M , embedded in plastic to standardize the fluorometer and compare experiments done at different times . The standard is available from Starna Cells , Inc . ( Atascadero , CA ) . Celsolin and Binary Complex Purification : Gelsolin and the EGTA - stable binary complex of actin and gelsolin were purified as previously described ( 7 , 27 ) . Alternatively we have used immunoaffinity - purified gelsolin and gelsolin - actin complexes ( Hwo , S . , and J . Bryan , manuscript submitted for publication ) . Calcium Concentrations : The free Ca 2÷ concentrations in solution were determined using the computer algorithms and binding constants given by Goldstein ( 18 ) . The original programs have been rewritten to run on an IBM - PC ( IBM Instruments , Inc . , Danbury , CT ) with an 8087 arithmetic co - processor . The 8087 support software was from MicroWare inc . ( Kingston , MA ) . Other Methods : Protein concentrations were determined by a modi - fication of the Bradford method ( 4 ) using bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) as a standard . Alternatively , the gelsolin concentrations were estimated using a BRYAN AND COLUCClO Gelsolin , F - actin Severing and Depolymerization 12 3 7 on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m molar extinction coefficient of 150 , 000 at 280 nm determined for bovine serum brevin . Depolymerization experiments were done by diluting F - actin , usually from a 3 uM stock solution , into buffer or buffer - containing gelsolin . Solutions were mixed by gently agitating the cuvette for 5 - 6 s then starting to take recordings . The first data points were usually obtained 9 - 10 s after sample addition . Every effort was made to standardize this mixing to keep any filament breakage that occurs as constant as possible . RESULTS The Celsolin - Actin Complex Caps the Preferred End of Actin Filaments When F - actin is diluted to a concentration below its critical concentration , there is a net disassembly of polymer . Fig . 1 shows the results of diluting pyrenyl F - actin , initially assem - bled at an actin concentration of 3 # M in G - buffer containing 100 mM KCI and 3 mM MgC12 , into the same buffer either with or without 4 nM gelsolin - actin complex . The final actin concentration after dilution was 40 nM . The calculated free Ca 2 + concentration after adjusting for binding to ATP was 0 . 17 mM ; therefore , > 99 % of the gelsolin - actin complex was in the GA ~ Ca2 form before addition of the F - actin . This percentage was estimated assuming that the Ca 2÷ binding constant for GA ~ Ca ~ is 106 M - t . The results indicate that upon dilution , GA ~ Ca2 very rapidly binds to filaments and slows their rate of disassembly . We assume that actin filaments will depolymerize only from their ends ; therefore , a decrease in the depolymerization rate as measured by a loss of fluores - cence indicates a decrease in the number of depolymerizing ends . This result is consistent with a capping mechanism that blocks monomer loss from the kinetically more active , ie . , the preferred end . In this particular experiment , in order to block ends rapidly , the amount of complex used was in excess of the number of filament ends . For example , the average initial filament length is ~ 2 - 3 urn , which indicates that we should have about a 100 - fold excess of complex to filaments . In other experiments , we have used complex concentrations as low as 0 . 3 nM and observed significant capping activity . 100 - - 8O Q > O o 60 0 , 7 40 . _ ~ FIGURE 1 ~ | Hi | | 0 0 0 - - 0 0 0 O0 • ill • • 0 0 000 0 0 • l I Nml • iBm 0 000000 0 O00 I I I 1 I 1 2 3 4 5 Time , seconds x 10 " - a Depolymerization of pyrenyl F - actin in the presence and absence of the GA1Ca2 complex .

Pyrene - labeled rabbit skeletal muscle actin at 3 ~ M was assembled overnight at room temperature in 5 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 5 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM azide , and 1 . 0 mM EGTA by the addition of KCI and MgCI2 to 100 mM and 3 mM , respectively . To induce disassembly , 20 # 1 of the F - actin was diluted to a final concentration of 40 nM into buffer either with ( ii ) or without ( O ) 3 . 85 nM gelsolin - actin complex . In the presence of EGTA , depolymerization as measured by a decrease in fluorescence was slowed in the presence of complex . We estimated the ratio of the dissociation rate constants at the preferred and nonpreferred ends by assuming all the preferred ends are rapidly capped when diluted into this excess of GA ~ Ca2 . The initial rate for the uncapped sample is given by dP dt = k° + ff [ + ends ] + kofr [ - ends ] , ( 1 ) where P is the concentration of actin in polymer , and ko + ff and ko ~ are the dissociation rate constants at the preferred ( + ) and nonpreferred ( - ) ends , respectively . Similarly , the initial rate for the fully capped sample is given by dP - dt = kofr [ - ends ] . ( 2 ) Using the values of the slopes , in arbitrary fluorescence U / s ( from Fig . 1 ) of 0 . 006 for the capped experiment and 0 . 05 for the uncapped experiment , and solving Eqs . 1 and 2 , the ratio of k + ofr / kofr is - 7 - 7 . 5 . Under similar solution conditions , Bon - der et at . ( 3 ) , using the Limulus bundle assay , quote a 4 - 7 - fold difference in the dissociation rate constants at the two ends . Fig . 2 illustrates the same type of experiment done using EGTA to reduce the Ca 2÷ concentration . The calculated free Ca 2÷ concentration was < 10 - 9 M . The result demonstrates that GA ~ Ca ~ also caps the preferred end in the absence of calcium , but its rate of association is lower . This is consistent with the reduced binding constant for monomer observed in EGTA ( 8 ) .

Pyrene actin at a concentration of 3 pM was polymerized for 18 - 24 h at 20°C in 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 2 mM CaClz , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 50 mM KCI , and 3 mM MgCI2 . Depolymerization was initiated by dilution of a 20 - ~ I aliquot into 1 . 5 ml of 10 mM imidazole , 0 . 2 mM CaCI2 , 50 mM KCI , and 3 mM MgClz . The fluorescence values for dilutions with 60 pM ( I ) , 300 pM ( i - ] ) , 600 pM ( A ) , and 1 . 2 nM ( A ) gelsolin are compared with a control containing no gelsolin ( O ) . Note that data are plotted on a logarith - mic scale of fluorescence . less than the concentration ofactin in polymer . The calculated free Ca 2 + concentration was 0 . 17 raM , therefore the gelsolin was mainly GCa2 before the actin was added . Dilution of pyrenyl F - actin into gelsolin markedly enhanced the rate of depolymerization in contrast to the results seen with GAjCa2 . A plot of the initial rates of disassembly versus the concentra - tion of gelsolin in the dilution buffer was linear ( data not shown ) . The results are consistent with a severing mechanism that generates new ends , but could also be due to increased dissociation of monomers . In support of the severing mecha - nism , we have taken samples in the first 20 - 30 s after dilution of F - actin into gelsolin and found , by electron microscopy , a twofold decrease in average filament length when the depo - lymerization reaction was less than 10 % complete ( data not shown ) . Yin et al . ( 44 ) have reported a similar rapid reduction of filament length using macrophage gelsolin . Although we cannot completely rule out an increase in the dissociation rate , perhaps by an " exo " cutting mechanism , it seems un - likely to us that an increased monomer dissociation rate constant could account for the rapid decrease in filament length with no corresponding fluorescence change . We inter - pret the electron microscope data as support for a mechanism involving depolymerization from an increased number of ends generated by an " endo " cutting mechanism . The dilution of F - actin into gelsolin should eventually lead to the formation of GA ~ Ca2 , GA2Ca2 , and higher oligomers with capping activity . This was tested by making a second F - actin addition after baseline fluorescence was reached . In contrast to the rapid decrease in fluorescence that was seen when F - actin was originally diluted into gelsolin , the added F - actin now behaves as if it were capped and depolymerizes more slowly than do the controls . The results as shown in BRYAN Fig . 4 demonstrate that depolymerization blocking activity is present . We have attempted to determine ifgelsolin , not complexed with actin , will bind preferentially to a preferred end . Our expectation was that if gelsolin had a substantially higher affinity for the preferred end than for interior actin molecules , we would see a reduced rate ofdepolymerization after dilution into low concentrations of gelsolin , since under these condi - tions each preferred end is depolymerizing at least seven times more rapidly than a nonpreferred end . Simulations to study the validity of this conclusion depend upon a number of factors including the concentrations of gelsolin and actin , the initial length distribution , which establishes the concentration of ends , the relative binding constants for an end ( KE ) versus the side ( KL ) of a filament , the mechanism of severing , and the relative dissociation constants at the two ends of a fila - ment . For example , if we assume a population of filaments with an average length of ~ I . l urn , or - 400 monomers , the number of ends in a 40 nM solution is 0 . I nM . For simple binding mechanisms , GE , the gelsolin bound to an end is KE [ G ] [ ends ] . Similarly GL , the gelsolin bound laterally to a filament is - - KL [ G ] [ actin in filaments ] if the ratio ofactin to gelsolin is large . If the initial gelsolin concentration is 0 . 1 nM , we calculate that the affinity for an end , KE , must be 800 - 1 , 000 times larger than KL , for KL values > l0 s M - ~ , if one - half the preferred ends are to be capped . This would produce an easily detectable 40 - 50 % decrease in the initial rate of depolymerization relative to the control when F - actin was diluted into gelsolin . This can be calculated by substituting the relative values in Eq . 1 using ko ~ = 7 , and k ~ er = 1 as estimated from Fig . 1 . This conclusion holds even if all the remaining gelsolin molecules make one cut in a filament provided they remain at the preferred end and block depoly - merization , but , if gelsolin molecules are released and can sever more than once , the situation is more complex and the calculated initial rates are greater than the controls .

The total actin concentration in these samples was now 80 nM . Depolymerization in the original gelsolin - containing sample was now slower than in the control , indicating that the gelsolin bound to the disassembled monomers to form complexes that behave as caps .

This figure summarizes the data from the three types of dilution experiments discussed in the text . The data points fall in two groups . The group labeled precapped ( 0 ) is for dilution of pyrenyl F - actin capped with gelsolin into buffer alone . The second group , labeled severed , is for dilution of either uncapped ( A ) or capped ( [ 3 ) pyrenyl F - actin into buffer containing varying amounts of gelsolin ( GCa2 ) . For the precapped group ( 0 ) , 3 # M pyrenyl G - actin was assembled in the presence of 3 . 75 - 75 nM concentrations of GCa2 . These capped filaments were diluted into gelsolin - free buffer to a final actin concentration of 40 nM . The final gelsolin concentrations range from 0 . 05 to 1 . 0 nM . The initial rate data , after conversion to nanomolar actin by comparison with pyrenyl F - actin at known concentrations , were plotted versus the final gelsolin concentrations . For the uncapped samples in the severed group ( & ) , 3 # M pyrenyl F - actin was diluted into buffer plus gelsolin . For the capped samples in the severed group ( F - I ) , 3 # M pyrenyl G - actin was assembled with 15 nM gelsolin plus KCI and MgCI2 , then diluted to a final actin concentration of 40 nM into buffer plus gelsolin . The initial rates , for both sets of severed samples after conversion to actin concentrations , were plotted versus the concentration of gelsolin in the dilution buffer . Note that the precapped samples diluted into gelsolin each contain an additional 0 . 2 nM gelsolin initially associated with the filaments . The data from the severing experiments lie on one line with a slope of 0 . 27 molecules of actin released per molecule of gelsolin per second . The data from the precapped filaments gave a different line with a lower value for the slope : 0 . 069 s - 1 + 0 . 008 ( SD ) . Several of the experiments in each group were done on the same preparations of actin and gelsolin to minimize differences among samples . The line for the severed group extrapolates to the rate expected for F - actin nucleated with 0 . 2 nM gelsolin . This coincides with the initial rates of disassembly of uncapped F - actin assembled at 3 # M . The buffer was 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM KCI , 1 mM MgCI2 , 0 . 2 mM CaCI2 . 1 240 THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY ' VOLUME 101 , 1985 Single Versus Multiple Cut Mechanisms We have begun to study the mechanism of cutting by comparing the incremental change in the initial rate of de - polymerization per gelsolin molecule using three separate conditions . The assumption is that the initial rate of depoly - merization is a reasonable measure of the number of kineti - cally active filament ends and that changes in the number of ends will be reflected in the initial rates . First , we have studied the dilution of precapped filaments . These were prepared by incubating solutions of G - actin ( 3 gM ) with increasing concentrations of gelsolin , 3 . 75 - 150 nM , then polymerizing by addition of KC1 and MgC12 . Under these conditions the preferred ends are capped by gelsolin since the final polymer concentration is reduced to the critical concentration of the nonpreferred ends ( 1 uM ) . To determine the initial rate of depolymerization , the samples were diluted to a final actin concentration of 40 nM . The initial rate of depolymerization is given by Eq . 2 or dP dt = kgffa [ gelsolin ] , ( 3 ) where a is a factor that specifies the number of ends formed per gelsolin molecule , and a [ gelsolin ] is the concentration of ends . We assume initially that a is equal to 1 and that on a plot of the initial rates versus [ gelsolin ] the slope is k ; fra ( see Fig . 5 ) . Second , we have studied the dilution of uncapped actin filaments into gelsolin . This is the same experimental design as indicated in Fig . 3 . Under these conditions , if we assume for the sake of simplicity that capping does not take place , then the initial rate of depolymerization is given by dP dt = ( ko ~ + kofr ) [ ends ] o ~ d + koff ~ [ gelsolin ] , ( 4 ) which is Eq . 1 plus the contribution from the newly generated ends . We introduce a factor / ~ that specifies the number of new ends formed per gelsolin molecule and indicate the dissociation constant as koff since it is uncertain whether gelsolin caps the newly formed preferred ends , in which case kou would be equal to kgu , or may cut several times and generate new preferred ends . In this latter case , kofr should be equal to ( kgff + k + ff ) . On a plot of the initial rate versus the concentration of gelsolin , the intercept gives the contribution from the old ends , while the slope gives kofr ~ . It is important to note that for a mechanism in which gelsolin cuts a filament a single time , then remains on the preferred end and blocks monomer dissociation , the slopes for the first and second dilution experiments should be equal . Finally , we have studied the dilution ofprecapped filaments into gelsolin . In this case the initial rate of depolymerization is given by dP dt = kgfr [ ends ] o ~ d + koff ~ [ gelsolin ] . ( 5 ) The experiment is done by polymerizing 3 ~ tM G - actin in 15 nM gelsolin as outlined for the precapped dilution experi - ments . After each dilution we have a final actin concentration of 40 nM . The concentration of the F - actin - associated gel - solin that is carried over from the dilution is 0 . 2 nM . The variable is the concentration of gelsolin in the dilution buffer . on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m On a plot of the initial rates versus the concentration of gelsolin , the intercept gives the contribution from the old ends and the slope gives kofffl . Note again that the slope for a mechanism with one cut and obligatory capping should be the same as the precapped case . Fig . 5 summarizes the data for multiple individual experi - ments for each case discussed above . The dilution buffer for this particular set of experiments was 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 2 mM CaCI2 , 50 mM KC1 , and 1 mM MgC12 . The results show that under these solution conditions the slopes of the two severing experiments , F - actin diluted into gelsolin and precapped F - actin diluted into gelsolin , are about the same , but are significantly greater , ~ 4 - 5 - fold , than the slope for dilution of precapped F - actin into buffer without gelsolin . We interpret the similarity of slopes in the two severing experiments to mean , first , that the presence of a cap does not interfere with the length restriction mechanism . For ex - ample , we think that cyclic " nibbling " mechanisms that re - quire a free preferred end are unlikely . A second point is that capping of the old preferred ends by gelsolin does not make a large contribution to the depolymerization reaction . The difference in slopes between the two severing cases and the precapped case strongly suggests that gelsolin generates different numbers of kinetically active ends when it can combine with G - actin and act as a nucleation site rather than combine directly with F - actin and introduce breaks . One possibility is that a significant amount of gelsolin is not actin associated in the nucleation case and that the number of ends per gelsolin is low , or a < 1 . We favor a mechanism where a = 1 and the number of ends generated by dilution into gelsolin is greater than 1 per gelsolin , fl > I . One reason to favor this mechanism is that k2rra determined from Fig . 5 is - 0 . 069 s - ~ which is close to , but lower than , the kofr determined by other methods , suggesting that a = 1 . Direct measurements by electron microscopy using microvillus cores or Limulus bun - dles have given values for kgfr ranging from 0 . 27 to 1 . 4 s - t ( 3 , 10 , 32 ) . Our determination is lower than these values by a factor of from 4 to 20 depending upon the value chosen for comparison . The significance of this difference is not yet clear .

For reasons that are not yet clear , the brevin num - ber , 1 . 8 x 104 M - ~ s < , for k ~ , is somewhat low ( 14 ) . A second reason to favor a value of a = 1 is the high affinity ofgelsolin for aetin under polymerizing conditions ( 8 , 26 ) . A final reason to favor a variable - cut mechanism is that the concentration of KCI and Mg 2÷ markedly affect the values of ko ~ r as discussed below . [ KCI ] and [ Mg 2 + ] Affect kort We have repeated the comparison shown in Fig . 5 using several different solution conditions . Figs . 6 and 7 show the results at two extremes . For Fig . 6 , the dilutions were made into G - buffer with 100 mM KCI and l0 ~ M MgCl2 . The final salt concentrations including the contribution from the F - actin were 101 mM KCl and 50 gM MgCI2 . The most obvious effect is that the slope of the line , kofrfl , for the two severing experiments is now lower than the precapped value , ko ~ ra , by a factor of - 3 . 5 . This is the reverse of the result found when the dilution buffer was 50 mM KCl and l mM MgCl2 , as shown in Fig . 5 . Fig . 7 illustrates the results of a set of dilution experiments where the dilution buffer was G - buffer containing 5 mM MgC12 plus 1 . 3 mM KC1 carried over from the F - actin . Under these conditions kofr [ 3 > koffa , but the ratio , 2 . 3 , is less than that shown in Fig . 5 . The results show that the number of ends generated per gelsolin molecule are continuously variable and are a function of the ionic conditions . We have studied the effect of adding Mg 2÷ to F - actin depolymerizing in the presence of 1 nM gelsolin and a fixed concentration of KCI . The results of one experiment are given in Fig . 8 . At time zero , F - actin was diluted into G - buffer containing 100 mM KC1 , 10 uM MgC12 in the presence or absence of 1 nM gelsolin . Depolymerization was allowed to proceed for 3 min before the addition of Mg 2÷ to 5 mM . The control , without gelsolin in the dilution buffer , showed little change in the rate of depolymerization .

Pyrene - labeled ac - tin , in G - buffer , was assembled at 3 # M by the addition of KCI and MgCl2 to 100 mM and 3 mM , respectively . 20 - ul aliquots were diluted into G - buffer containing 100 mM KCl and 10 t ~ M MgCI2 to a final actin concentration of 40 nM either in the presence ( n ) or absence ( O ) of gelsolin at 1 nM . In both cases , once assembly was begun , MgCIz was added to 5 mM . The effect of Mg 2 + on samples precapped with gelsolin was also tested . Actin was precapped with 75 nM gelsolin so that dilution of actin to 40 nM resulted in a final gelsolin concentration of 1 nM . Once assembly was begun , MgClz was added to 5 mM in one case ( i - I ) with no MgCI2 addition to the other ( O ) . Additions were made from a 1 M stock solution of MgCl2 at the times indicated by the arrows . gelsolin , on the other hand , showed a very marked increase in the depolymerization rate . The results cannot be explained by changes in the dissociation rates upon Mg 2÷ addition , since Mg 2÷ has been reported to decrease the rate of dissociation ( 14 ) and , in our control experiments , depolymerization that accompanies dilution of precapped filaments disassembling from their nonpreferred ends is unaffected by increasing Mg 2÷ in the dilution buffer ( Fig . 8 ) . The results are compatible with mechanisms in which Mg 2÷ binding either to F - actin and / or gelsolin facilitates severing . Fig . 9 compares the initial depolymerization rates , mea - sured after Mg 2÷ addition , as a function of Mg 2÷ concentra - tion . The experiment was repeated at various KCI concentra - tions . The general conclusion is that KC1 either stabilizes filaments against the action of gelsolin or inhibits gelsolin , while Mg 2÷ appears to destabilize filaments or promote the action of gelsolin . A comparison of the single points at 50 mM KCI , 1 mM Mg 2÷ , and at 100 mM KC1 , 40 t ~ M Mg 2÷ agrees with the data in Figs . 5 and 6 . Gelsolin is the least effective in KC1 alone , while addition of Mg 2÷ increases the rate of depolymerization . The half - maximal stimulation val - ues for 50 and 100 mM KCI are 0 . 45 and 0 . 55 mM Mg ~ ÷ , respectively . DISCUSSION There are three major experimental results in this paper . ( a ) We note a marked difference in the effects of the gelsolin - actin complex , GA ~ Ca2 , versus gelsolin , GCa2 , on dilution - induced F - actin depolymerization . ( b ) We observe that the initial rates of depolymerization per gelsolin molecule differ depending on whether gelsolin is used to nucleate assembly or is present in the buffer into which F - actin is diluted . ( c ) The ability of gelsolin in the dilution buffer to affect the depolymerization rate is dependent upon the ionic condition : KCI appears to stabilize filaments against gelsolin , whereas 1242 THE JOU . NAL OF CELL B , OLOG¥ • VOLUME 101 , 1985 Mg 2÷ promotes fragmentation . We have interpreted these results in terms of either severing or capping of actin filaments by gelsolin or the gelsolin - actin complex , respectively . We have provided evidence previously that GA ] Ca2 will cap the barbed end of F - actin . GAjCa2 blocks the growth of monomers from the barbed end ( 36 ) , will nucleate actin assembly ( 36 ) , and will increase the steady - state concentration of actin to that expected for the pointed end ( 27 ) . The direct evidence for severing is more problematic . Rapid shortening of filaments after gelsolin addition has been reported ( 44 ) , and we confirm that result here . Similarly , viscometric measurements consistent with severing have been reported ( 36 , 44 ) . The major argument against severing has been the idea that fragmentation can occur either sponta - neously or as a result of mixing , and that gelsolin then caps the fragments and blocks reannealing . We demonstrate that this is not the situation since GAtCa2 , which does bind to barbed ends , has the reverse effect from gelsolin . The question of whether gelsolin alone can cap a barbed end remains open . We could not find conditions or concentrations where gelsolin 0 . 16 0 . 14 f , 3 m 0 . 12 o 0 . 10 0 . 08 0 , 06 u , . - 8 0 . 04 ® 0 . 02 0 . 01 FIGURE 9 ° (cid:127) ° f f ° o / / / / ° a / ' / m - - .

Pyrenyl G - actin was assembled overnight in G - buffer containing 100 mM KCI and 3 mM MgCI2 . To induce disassembly , 20 - p . I aliquots of F - actin were diluted into G - buffers each containing 10 / zM MgCI2 and 1 nM gelsolin but with different KCI concentrations ( 25 mM [ 71 ] ; 50 mM [ A ] ; 100 mM [ U ] ) . Disassembly was allowed to proceed for 180 s at which time different amounts of MgCI2 were added . The initial rates of change in fluorescence upon addition of Mg 2÷ are plotted vs Mg 2 + concen - tration . High concentrations of KCI acted to stabilize the F - actin from disassembly in the presence of gelsolin , i . e . , at higher KCi concentrations , more MgCI2 was needed to produce the same effect . oO + oo + G l ! Go 4 11 211 - i - G FIGURE 10 Schematic representation of the gelsolin - actin inter - action during the dilution experiments . Step 1 indicates lateral binding of a gelsolin molecule liganded with Ca 2÷ to an actin filament . This binding requires that site I , the EGTA - stable actin - binding site , be unoccupied . Step 2 is the severing reaction , and we propose that gelsolin may be released . Step 3 indicates a competing reaction where site I becomes occupied by an actin monomer and forms an EGTA - stable complex that can only cap the barbed filament end , step 4 . on N o v e m be r 6 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m will decrease the initial rate ofdepolymerization and conclude that gelsolin , as GCa2 , does not preferentially bind to barbed filament ends . Using the model in Fig . 10 , we illustrate two possibilities : gelsolin , as GCa2 , can bind laterally to an actin filament ( step 1 ) , sever the filament ( step 2 ) , and be released . We assume that reannealing , which would be the reverse of step 2 , is extremely rare at the concentrations of actin in - volved . The second possibility is that gelsolin binds with an actin monomer to form a complex ( step 3 ) that then caps a preferred filament end ( step 4 ) . When F - actin is diluted into gelsolin , these two sets of reactions compete , but the G - actin concentration is initially low and lateral binding is favored . This leads to severing and the generation of additional kinet - ically active ends . This gives a fl value > 1 . As depolymeriza - tion proceeds , the chance for complex formation is greater and an increasing number of gelsolin molecules become trapped on the barbed ends of filaments . In this model , KCI and MgC12 could affect the action of gelsolin at several steps . Lateral binding , for example , could be dependent upon the Mg 2÷ concentration and inhibited by KC1 . Alternatively , these cations could bind directly to gelsolin and influence its func - tion . A third possibility , the one that we favor , is that KCI and MgCI2 , which are known to bind to F - actin , affect the stability of the actin filaments and their resistance to severing by gelsolin and other severing proteins . This idea is supported by the studies of Wegner and Savko ( 41 ) on fragmentation of actin polymers . Filaments in 40 mM KC1 appear to fragment less than those in 0 . 6 mM MgC12 . Actin - binding proteins like tropomyosin , which stabilize filaments , also protect against gelsolin in vitro and may be important in controlling its action in vivo ( 15 ) . We can now relate severing and capping to the two actin - binding sites on gelsolin . For the sake of simplicity , we define the site that retains a Ca 2÷ and an actin in the presence of EGTA as site I ; the other as site II . Severing clearly requires that site I be unoccupied . In terms of the model in Fig . 10 , it is not clear which step , lateral binding or severing , is Ca 2÷ - sensitive or whether site I is involved in lateral binding or only severing . Our preliminary experiments suggest lateral binding requires Ca 2÷ . The relatively small Ca2 + - sensitivity of capping by the gelsolin - actin complex suggests that site II is involved in the capping reaction . Both capping and occupancy of site II by an actin monomer can occur in EGTA , but the association constants are higher in Ca 2÷ . Whether site II is required for severing is not yet clear . Gelsolin shares several characteristics with other actin - sev - ering proteins . Depactin ( 28 ) and brain actin depolymerizing protein ( 1 ) are small , 15 - 20 - kD proteins , that sever filaments but are Ca2÷ - insensitive . Fragmin ( 20 ) , severin ( 6 , 16 ) , and the sea urchin 45 - kD protein ( 37 ) sever and nucleate actin filaments and are Ca2 + - sensitive . In addition , these proteins all appear to have a single actin binding site and will form EGTA - stable complexes with actin . The significance of this stability in situ is unknown . Villin ( 5 , 13 , 17 , 30 ) has two actin binding sites , will sever and nucleate filaments , but does not form an EGTA - stable complex with actin . We are cur - rently working on determining the structure of gelsolin in order to define the actin - and Ca2 + - binding domains and look for homology with the other actin - severing proteins .
