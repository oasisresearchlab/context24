Upon activation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) , Rac1 associates with a variety of proteins in the cell thereby regulating various functions , including cell migration . However , activation of Rac1 can lead to opposing migratory phenotypes raising the possibility of exacerbating tumour progression when targeting Rac1 in a clinical setting . This calls for the identiﬁcation of factors that inﬂuence Rac1 - driven cell motility . Here we show that Tiam1 and P - Rex1 , two Rac GEFs , promote Rac1 anti - and pro - migratory signalling cascades , respectively , through regulating the Rac1 interactome . In particular , we demonstrate that P - Rex1 stimulates migration through enhancing the interaction between Rac1 and the actin - remodelling protein ﬂightless - 1 homologue , to modulate cell contraction in a RhoA - ROCK - independent manner .

NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 7 : 10664 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms10664 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 1 C ell migration and invasion play an important role in various physiological functions , such as embryonic devel - opment , immune cell responses and wound healing . In addition , aberrant regulation of cell motility is linked to tumour progression with increased cell migration and invasion marking a key step in metastasis , the major cause of death in cancer patients 1 , 2 . Studies focused on deciphering the underlying mechanisms involved in cell migration and invasion have identiﬁed ﬁve key steps that govern the mesenchymal - mode of single - cell motility : ( 1 ) front - rear polarization ; ( 2 ) membrane protrusion at the leading edge ; ( 3 ) cell – extra - cellular matrix ( ECM ) adhesion ; ( 4 ) actomyosin contractility ; and ( 5 ) detachment of the cell rear 3 , 4 . Given the required interplay between the actin cytoskeleton , cell – ECM adhesions and myosin motor contractile forces , various signalling proteins are implicated in regulating cell migration . Rac1 , a member of the Rho family of small GTPases , is of particular importance . Similarly to other small GTPases , Rac1 serves as a molecular switch cycling between an inactive GDP - bound form and an active GTP - bound form . Upon activation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) , Rac1 undergoes a conformational change allowing it to bind to and activate downstream effectors that directly and indirectly inﬂuence cell migration and invasion in normal and cancer cells 3 , 5 , 6 . However , activation of Rac1 can lead to opposing migratory phenotypes . Through its ability to promote front - rear polarization 7 , 8 , lamellipodia formation 9 – 11 , as well as assembly of focal complexes at the leading edge 12 , 13 , Rac1 promotes cell migration and invasion . However , Rac1 is also essential for maintaining cell – cell contacts in epithelial cells via promoting cadherin - mediated cell – cell junctions 14 – 16 . As a result , Rac1 is implicated in impeding cell migration and invasion . The dual role of Rac1 in cell migration and invasion is further demonstrated by its ability to regulate the expression and release of matrix metalloproteinases 17 , 18 , which aid in ECM degradation , as well as the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 19 . These contrasting roles of Rac1 in migration and invasion make its therapeutic potential uncertain and call for the identiﬁcation of factors that regulate Rac1 downstream speciﬁcity . Rac1 differential downstream effects are often attributed to differences in cell type and upstream signalling from the ECM 20 , 21 ; however , the mechanism by which these inputs control selectivity downstream of Rac1 is poorly understood . Interestingly , GEFs have been shown to inﬂuence responses downstream of Rho1 in yeast cells 22 , 23 . Moreover , a limited number of studies propose a scaffolding role of GEFs , whereby they bind either directly to GTPase effectors 24 – 26 or indirectly through other scaffolding proteins 27 , 28 . Thus GEFs present an interesting class of proteins that could potentially play a role not only in Rac1 activation but also in dictating Rac1 downstream effects that govern its anti - migratory versus pro - migratory cellular phenotypes . To rigorously evaluate the hypothesis that GEFs determine output downstream of Rac1 by regulating its interaction with effectors , we were particularly interested in comparing Rac1 GEFs known to induce opposing Rac1 - driven cellular effects . We therefore focused on Tiam1 and P - Rex1 , two Rac GEFs that have been associated with contrasting migratory phenotypes 14 , 29 – 33 . Interestingly , we show that activation of Rac1 by either GEF , under the same cellular conditions , results in distinct morphological phenotypes and differential actin cytoskeletal rearrangements that dictate Rac1 anti - versus pro - migratory roles . In addition , we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry screen uncovering distinct sets of interactors with differential Rac1 binding , dependent on the upstream GEF . Focusing on P - Rex1 - enriched Rac1 binding partners , we identify protein ﬂightless - 1 homolog ( FLII ) , a gelsolin protein superfamily member , as a novel Rac1 effector that is required for mediating P - Rex1 - Rac1 - driven cell migration through modulating cell contraction in a RhoA - ROCK - independent manner . Thus , our data demonstrate the importance of GEFs in dictating Rac1 functional speciﬁcity through modulating effector binding and uncover a previously unreported signalling cascade that regulates Rac1 - driven cell migration . Results Tiam1 and P - Rex1 induce differential Rac1 downstream effects . To achieve selective activation of Tiam1 - Rac1 and P - Rex1 - Rac1 signalling cascades irrespective of upstream signalling , we utilized a doxycycline ( dox ) - inducible system to overexpress wild - type ( WT ) Tiam1 or P - Rex1 in NIH3T3 cells . In addition , to exclude phenotypic changes due to GEF overexpression alone rather than GEF - mediated Rac1 activation , previously described Tiam1 and P - Rex1 GEF - dead mutants ( GEF * ) 34 , 35 were also introduced into cells and analysed in parallel with WT proteins ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Active Rac1 pulldown experiments demonstrated the ability of Tiam1 WT and P - Rex1 WT but not their GEF * mutants to activate Rac1 ( Supplementary Fig . 1b , c ) . In addition , unlike Rac1 , levels of active Cdc42 and RhoA , two small GTPases that are also implicated in cell migration , were not affected upon expression of the different GEF constructs , conﬁrming the selectivity of Tiam1 and P - Rex1 in activating Rac1 ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Changes in cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton rearrange - ments are known to accompany cell migration 4 , therefore using the dox - inducible system we examined the effect of GEFs in regulating these processes . In NIH3T3 cells , expression of Tiam1 WT was associated with increased cell aggregation and membrane rufﬂing inducing an epithelial - like morphology in the otherwise mesenchymal NIH3T3 cells ( Fig . 1c , d ) . These morphological changes were also accompanied with increased actin localization at cell – cell contacts , consistent with the observed cell aggregation ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . More importantly , expression of Tiam1 WT resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in cell migration ( Fig . 1e , f ) . In contrast , expression of P - Rex1 WT was predominantly associated with an elongated morphology and the formation of thin membrane protrusions ( Fig . 1c , d ) rich in polymerized actin ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . In addition , Oris migration assays demonstrated that unlike Tiam1 WT , P - Rex1 activation of Rac1 resulted in signiﬁcantly increased cell migration ( Fig . 1e , f ) . Importantly , these observations were limited to dox treated cells expressing the WT proteins but not the GEF * mutants ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , indicating that the observed phenotypes following expression of Tiam1 and P - Rex1 are Rac1 - driven . Interestingly , expression of Tiam1 WT and P - Rex1 WT , but not their GEF * mutants , in the epithelial squamous cell carcinoma cell line , A431 , and the epithelial immortalized Madin - Darby canine kidney cell line , MDCKII , resulted in phenotypic effects similar to those observed in NIH3T3 cells ( Fig . 2 and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Expression of Tiam1 WT induced an even more compact epithelioid morphology asso - ciated with membrane rufﬂing and more deﬁned cell – cell contacts that were distinguishable from control cells ( Fig . 2a , b and Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) . Consistently , increased actin localization at cell junctions was observed in A431 cells expressing Tiam1 WT ( Fig . 2c ) . On the other hand , P - Rex1 WT expression resulted in a prominent morphological shift to elongated cells ( Fig . 2a , b and Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) , with disrupted actin staining at cell – cell contacts ( Fig . 2c ) . GEF expression was also accompanied by differential cell migration in MDCKII cells , with Tiam1 WT signiﬁcantly suppressing migra - tion and P - Rex1 WT promoting migration ( Supplementary ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms10664 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 7 : 10664 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms10664 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 245180 63 245180 NIH3T3 Cdc42 RhoA Rac1 25 25 25 Active GTPase pulldown WB : Tiam1 WB : α - Tubulin Input WB : Cdc42 WB : RhoA WB : Rac1 WB : P - Rex1 G D P G T P γ S C on t r o l T i a m 1 W T P - R e x 1 W T T i a m 1 G E F * P - R e x 1 G E F * G D P G T P γ S C on t r o l T i a m 1 W T P - R e x 1 W T T i a m 1 G E F * P - R e x 1 G E F * + Dox – D o x + D o x Control Tiam1 WT Tiam1 GEF * P - Rex1 WT P - Rex1 GEF * NIH3T3 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 Rac1 Cdc42 RhoA G D P ( I na c t i v e ) C on t r o l T i a m 1 W T T i a m 1 G E F * P - R e x 1 W T P - R e x 1 G E F * G T P γ S ( A c t i v e ) N o r m a li z ed G T P a s e a c t i v a t i on NS * * * * * * NS NS NIH3T3 + Dox Control Tiam1 WT Tiam1 GEF * P - Rex1 WT P - Rex1 GEF * NIH3T3 0 h 24 h – D o x + D o x 0 h 24 h 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 C e ll s ( % ) Elongated Epithelial - like Mesenchymal C on t r o l T i a m 1 W T P - R e x 1 W T T i a m 1 G E F * P - R e x 1 G E F * C on t r o l T i a m 1 W T P - R e x 1 W T T i a m 1 G E F * P - R e x 1 G E F * – Dox + Dox NIH3T3 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 1 . 4 N o r m a li z ed c e ll m i g r a t i on ( % ) NS NS * * 0 C on t r o l T i a m 1 W T P - R e x 1 W T T i a m 1 G E F * P - R e x 1 G E F * C on t r o l T i a m 1 W T P - R e x 1 W T T i a m 1 G E F * P - R e x 1 G E F * * * NS NS * * * NS – Dox + Dox NIH3T3 a b c d e f Figure 1 | Activation of Rac1 by Tiam1 or P - Rex1 induces differential effects in NIH3T3 cells .

Moreover , Tiam1 WT expression impeded epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) - induced cell scattering in A431 cells and hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) - induced cell scattering in MDCKII cells , while P - Rex1 WT expression resulted in enhanced scattering detected as early as 3 h post growth factor treatment ( Fig . 2d , e and Supplementary Fig . 2e , f ) . As expected and similarly to NIH3T3 cells , elevated levels of active Rac1 were only detected upon expression of the WT but not the GEF * mutants ( Fig . 2f and Supplementary Fig . 2g ) further conﬁrming the dependency of Tiam1 and P - Rex1 on Rac1 to induce differential phenotypes . Taken together these data demonstrate the ability of Tiam1 and P - Rex1 , irrespective of upstream signalling , to induce cell morphological changes and actin cytoskeletal rearrangements that govern Rac1 - driven anti - and pro - migratory phenotypes , respectively , in both normal and cancer cell lines . Tiam1 and P - Rex1 differentially regulate the Rac1 interactome . Having demonstrated that Tiam1 and P - Rex1 elicit distinct Rac1 - driven phenotypes , we were interested in deciphering the mechanism by which these contrasting phenotypes are mani - fested . We hypothesized that the observed GEF - induced differ - ential cell migratory phenotypes might be mediated by the ability of Tiam1 and P - Rex1 to modulate Rac1 - effector binding . To test this hypothesis , we engineered a double dox - inducible system for expression of StrepII - FLAG - tagged Rac1 ( SF - Rac1 ) alone or together with either Tiam1 or P - Rex1 ( WT or GEF * mutants ) in NIH3T3 cells . We then coupled the efﬁciency of SF - tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation ( TAP ) 36 – 38 with the quantitative power of stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture ( SILAC ) 39 , 40 to examine the Rac1 interactome following induction of either Tiam1 or P - Rex1 . By designing a ﬁve - way SILAC screen we were able to directly compare the relative abundance of Rac1 - associated proteins upon expression of Tiam1 WT / GEF * or P - Rex1 WT / GEF * to cells expressing SF - Rac1 only ( control ) . Given that the same control cells were used to identify changes in the Rac1 interactome between WT GEF expression ( Set1 ) and GEF * mutant expression ( Set2 ) , we were also able to indirectly assess the effect of WT versus GEF * GEF expression on Rac1 - effector binding . In addition , to increase the robustness of the SILAC quantiﬁcation , we performed reverse SILAC in which the SILAC labelling media were switched between Tiam1 WT / GEF * and P - Rex1 WT / GEF * cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Combined , 350 proteins were identiﬁed as putative Rac1 interacting proteins from a total of two SILAC and two reverse SILAC screens . We ﬁrst assessed the ability of the SF - TAP / SILAC approach to identify bona ﬁde Rac1 binding partners via conducting an extensive literature review combined with search - ing available protein databases , such as the human protein reference database ( ref . 41 ) , NetPath ( ref . 42 ) and the human protein – protein interaction predictions database 43 , 44 , to analyse the full list of identiﬁed proteins . As expected the SILAC screen yielded several known Rac1 binding partners , predicted Rac1 interactors , as well as proteins implicated in Rac1 signalling ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , thus suggesting that a large number of the remaining proteins are genuine novel Rac1 interactors . From the identiﬁed proteins , 231 were associated with quantiﬁable SILAC ratios in Z 2 SILAC screens . Interestingly , using a commonly accepted cutoff of ± 1 . 3 fold - change 45 , we identiﬁed a subset of Rac1 interactors that showed changes in Rac1 binding only upon expression of either GEF ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) , thus highlighting a role of Tiam1 and P - Rex1 in differentially modulating the Rac1 interactome . FLII is a novel P - Rex1 - enriched Rac1 binding partner . To determine whether GEF - mediated regulation of the Rac1 inter - actome is important for inducing differential effects downstream of Rac1 , we further classiﬁed the identiﬁed Rac1 binding partners according to their cellular functions using the Ingenuity inte - grated pathway analysis ( IPA ) software . Given the observed GEF - induced differential effects on cell migration , we focused on a shortlist of differentially regulated proteins falling within func - tional categories that relate to cell motility , including cell movement , cell morphology , cell signalling , cell - to - cell signal - ling and interaction , as well as cell assembly and organization ( Fig . 3a ) . Among the identiﬁed proteins , FLII exhibited a signiﬁcant GEF - dependent Rac1 binding fold - change between Tiam1 WT and P - Rex1 WT expressing cells . Relative to NIH3T3 cells expressing SF - Rac1 alone , SILAC ratios indicated that FLII was associated with approximately a ﬁve - fold ( P ¼ 1 . 46 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 6 ) and a 10 - fold ( P ¼ 7 . 13 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 9 ) increase in SF - Rac1 binding in a forward and reverse SILAC experiment , respec - tively , that was speciﬁc to P - Rex1 WT . In addition , FLII was not co - puriﬁed with SF - Rac1 upon expression of either Tiam1 GEF * or P - Rex1 GEF * , suggesting that it is functionally important for P - Rex1 - Rac1 - driven cellular effects . In contrast , the known Rac1 interactor RhoGDI1 showed limited SILAC ratio ﬂuctuations across the different samples that were comparable to ratios observed for Rac1 itself ( Supplementary Fig . 3c ) , indicating that the relative abundance of RhoGDI1 protein associated with Rac1 does not change upon expression of the different GEF con - structs . Taken together , these data demonstrate that SILAC ratios associated with proteins identiﬁed from the screens are not due to ﬂuctuations in Rac1 puriﬁcation , and more impor - tantly that expression of P - Rex1 WT induces speciﬁc changes in FLII SILAC ratios that are not observed for other proteins , such as RhoGDI1 . FLII is a member of the actin - remodelling gelsolin protein superfamily and has been implicated in cell migration . It has been shown to translocate from the nucleus and perinuclear region in motile NIH3T3 cells to actin - rich regions at the cell periphery , including membrane rufﬂes and the leading edge 46 . Moreover , FLII is implicated in regulating focal adhesion turnover through inhibiting the phosphorylation of paxillin in a Rac1 - dependent manner 47 , providing a link between FLII and Rac1 signalling . Using western blot analysis , we conﬁrmed that exogenous SF - Rac1 co - precipitates endogenous FLII following a streptavidin ( Strep ) pulldown of SF - Rac1 from HEK293T cells ( Fig . 3b ) . In addition , endogenous FLII also co - precipitated endogenous Rac1 conﬁrming that FLII is a novel Rac1 binding partner ( Fig . 3c ) . Furthermore , GST - pulldown experiments with puriﬁed GST or GST - Rac1 loaded with either GDP or GTP g S and incubated with endogenous FLII from HEK293T lysates revealed that FLII binds preferentially to active Rac1 ( Fig . 3d , e ) . To further validate this interaction , we utilized the Duolink in situ proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) to visualize the interaction between endogenous Rac1 and endogenous FLII upon expression of the different GEFs in NIH3T3 cells . Interestingly , an increased Duolink signal was only detected upon expression of P - Rex1 WT ( Fig . 3f , g ) . We also investigated the effect of P - Rex1 WT overexpression in MCF7 cells , which express higher levels of endogenous P - Rex1 compared with NIH3T3 cells , thus presenting a cell line that is conﬁgured to respond physiologically to P - Rex1 signalling . Similarly to NIH3T3 cells , overexpression of P - Rex1 WT in MCF7 cells stimulated the endogenous Rac1 - FLII interaction as indicated by the increased Duolink signal detected only in P - Rex1 WT expressing cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3d , e ) . Pulldown of SF - Rac1 from MCF7 cells following SF - TAP also revealed an enhanced interaction with endogenous FLII upon expression of P - Rex1 WT but not the other GEF constructs . In contrast , there was no change in the levels of co - precipitated RhoGDI1 upon expression of the different GEF constructs ( Supplementary Fig . 3f , g ) . Together , the Duolink in situ PLA assays and the SF - TAP further validate the NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms10664 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 7 : 10664 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms10664 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 5 SILAC screen and conﬁrm that the Rac1 - FLII interaction is enhanced upon P - Rex1 WT expression . FLII is a novel P - Rex1 binding partner . Given the proposed role of GEFs in controlling GTPase signalling through acting as molecular scaffolds , we were interested in determining whether , in addition to Rac1 , FLII binds to P - Rex1 and not Tiam1 . Immunoprecipitation of FLAG - tagged FLII from HEK293T cells co - expressing Myc - Tiam1 WT or Myc - P - Rex1 WT revealed that FLII binds preferentially to P - Rex1 ( Fig . 4a ) . Similarly , Myc - P - Rex1 WT but not Myc - Tiam1 WT co - precipitated FLAG - tagged FLII ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) .

P - Rex1 has been shown to drive cell migration and invasion in a number of melanoma cell lines , including CHL1 ( ref . 32 ) . Thus , to address whether this interaction occurs in a cellular setting in which P - Rex1 promotes migration and invasion we utilized the Duolink in situ PLA assay to visualize P - Rex1 - FLII binding in CHL1 cells . Interestingly , there was a signiﬁcant increase in the Duolink signal in CHL1 cells when both the P - Rex1 and FLII antibodies were applied compared with cells subjected to the FLII antibody only , indicating a strong endogenous interaction in these cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4c , d ) . Moreover , we found that both P - Rex1 WT and P - Rex1 GEF * bind to FLII in equal levels , demonstrating that the P - Rex1 - FLII interaction is independent of the P - Rex1 GEF activity ( Fig . 4c ) potentially occurring upstream of Rac1 activation . Although GEF activity is not a prerequisite for P - Rex1 - FLII interaction , GTP - loading of Rac1 enhances the Rac1 interaction with FLII . This hints at a dual role of P - Rex1 as both a Rac1 GEF and a molecular scaffold . FLII binds to Rac1 and P - Rex1 through different domains . As a member of the gelsolin protein superfamily , FLII possesses the characteristic gelsolin - like ( GEL ) domain . However , unlike other superfamily members , FLII also contains an N - terminal leucine - rich repeats ( LRR ) domain ( Fig . 5a ) with the two domains governing distinct functions . The GEL domain is mainly responsible for FLII - mediated actin remodelling 48 . On the other hand , LRR domains serve as protein – protein interaction motifs via forming a doughnut - or horseshoe - like conformation that serves as a hydrophobic pocket for protein binding 49 – 51 . To gain functional insight into the Rac1 - FLII and P - Rex1 - FLII interactions , previously described FLAG - tagged full - length FLII ( FLII FL ) , a GEL only mutant ( FLII GEL ) , and an LRR only mutant ( FLII LRR ) ( ref . 52 ) ( Fig . 5a ) were used to determine the FLII domain responsible for mediating its interaction with Rac1 and P - Rex1 . Intriguingly , FLAG co - immunoprecipitation of the different FLII domain mutants revealed that P - Rex1 binds to the GEL domain ( Fig . 5b ) , whereas Rac1 binds preferentially to the LRR domain of FLII ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . Using puriﬁed proteins we showed that P - Rex1 binds directly to the GEL domain of FLII ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . Rac1 binding to the LRR domain of FLII was also further conﬁrmed by GST pulldown of puriﬁed GTP g S loaded GST - Rac1 incubated with lysates from HEK293T cells expressing the different FLAG - tagged FLII domain mutants ( Fig . 5c ) . Together , the above data imply that P - Rex1 , Rac1 and FLII might form a ternary complex in cells that is functionally important for eliciting P - Rex1 - Rac1 - driven cellular phenotypes . FLII is required for P - Rex1 - Rac1 - driven cell migration . Despite a negative role for FLII in cell migration having previously been described 53 – 56 , P - Rex1 promotes migration through Rac1 activation concomitant with increased Rac1 - FLII binding , raising the possibility that FLII might positively inﬂuence migration . FLII depletion by siRNA in both (cid:2) dox and þ dox treated control NIH3T3 cells was associated with a modest yet signiﬁcant decrease in the ability of cells to migrate when compared with mock and non - targeting ( NT ) treated cells ( Supplementary Fig . 6a ) . Similar results were observed in (cid:2) dox treated NIH3T3 cells transduced with the different GEF dox - inducible systems ( Supplementary Fig . 6b – d and Fig . 6a – c ) . Interestingly , compared with mock and NT treated cells , there was no additive effect of FLII knockdown on the ability of Tiam1 WT to reduce cell migration in NIH3T3 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 6b ) . FLII depletion in Tiam1 GEF * and P - Rex1 GEF * expressing cells , on the other hand , resulted in a modest yet signiﬁcant reduction in cell migration ( Supplementary Fig . 6c , d ) similar to that observed in control NIH3T3 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 6a ) . Importantly , FLII depletion was sufﬁcient to abolish the ability of P - Rex1 WT to stimulate cell migration ( Fig . 6a – c ) . To further understand the role of FLII in P - Rex1 - Rac1 - driven cell migration we performed single - cell tracking following scratch assays in NIH3T3 cells treated with dox to induce expression of P - Rex1 WT . Consistent with the ORIS migration assays described above , FLII depletion using two different siRNAs was associated 63 Myc Myc - P - Rex1 FLAG - FLII Myc - Tiam1 HEK293T + 245180245180245 180135180 FLII Control – + P - Rex1WT – Tiam1WT – + FLAG IP WB : Myc WB : P - Rex1 WB : FLAG M2 WB : Tiam1 Input WB : α - Tubulin Control – + P - Rex1WT – + Tiam1WT – + * 63 MCF7 WB : FLII WB : P - Rex1 WB : α - Tubulin Input IgG P - Rex1 180135245180 IP FLII P - Rex1 IgG P - Rex1 63 P - Rex1 FLAG - FLII HEK293T 180135180245 FLAG IP FLII P - Rex1GEF * – + P - Rex1WT – + WB : P - Rex1 WB : FLAG M2 Input WB : α - Tubulin P - Rex1GEF * – + P - Rex1WT – + a b c Figure 4 | FLII is a novel P - Rex1 interactor that does not bind to Tiam1 .

Interestingly , FLII knock - down had no effect on the straightness of the track of cell movement ( Fig . 6g ) indicating that while FLII is important for mediating P - Rex1 - driven cell migration it does not inﬂuence directionality . Active Rac1 pulldown experiments following FLII depletion in NIH3T3 cells expressing P - Rex1 WT also demon - strated that the diminished migratory capacity of FLII knock - down cells is not due to reduced levels of either total or active Rac1 in these cells ( Supplementary Fig . 6e , f ) . Importantly , levels of active RhoA were not affected upon expression of P - Rex1 WT in conﬂuent monolayers of NIH3T3 cells that were scratched to induce cell migration ( Supplementary Fig . 6g , h ) . Similarly , there was no signiﬁcant increase in the levels of active RhoG in NIH3T3 cells expressing P - Rex1 WT upon stimulation of migration following scratching ( Supplementary Fig . 6i ) suggest - ing that P - Rex1 acts directly on Rac1 and not through RhoA or RhoG to stimulate cell migration in a FLII - dependent manner . Knockdown of FLII was also associated with reduced cell migration in CHL1 cells ( Fig . 6h – j ) , indicating that FLII is important for optimal cell migration in a cellular setting in which endogenous P - Rex1 is known to drive cell migration and invasion 32 . Interestingly , in migrating CHL1 cells both P - Rex1 and FLII co - localize at the leading edge together with actin ( Supplementary Fig . 6j ) . All together , these data highlight the interplay between P - Rex1 , Rac1 and FLII that is required for optimal P - Rex1 - Rac1 - driven cell migration . FLII is required for P - Rex1 - induced cell contractility . FLII has been shown to regulate cell contraction 47 . Activation of myosin II through myosin light chain ( MLC ) phosphorylation induces actomyosin contractility that is crucial for mediating cell migration 4 . The level of phosphorylated myosin II at the cell centre and rear is mediated through RhoA - ROCK signalling 57 ; however , two recent studies have implicated Rac1 in regulating myosin II phosphorylation and localization at the leading edge 58 , 59 . This combined with our ﬁndings demonstrating that GEF expression does not induce RhoA activation in NIH3T3 cells hinted at a potential role of P - Rex1 in promoting contractility in a FLII - dependent manner . To explore this possibility , primary ( 1 (cid:2) ) human ﬁbroblasts expressing pRetroX - Tight - Pur empty vector ( EV ) , Tiam1 WT or P - Rex1 WT were mixed with acid extracted rat - tail collagen I and the ability of either GEF to mediate contraction was assessed using a ﬁbroblast - collagen matrix contraction assay as previously described 60 . Interestingly , expression of P - Rex1 WT , but not Tiam1 WT enhanced ﬁbroblast - collagen matrix contraction signiﬁcantly compared with the (cid:2) dox treated and EV controls ( Fig . 7a , b ) . This was further demonstrated by examining the levels of phosphorylated MLC ( pMLC ) upon expression of either GEF . We found that expression of P - Rex1 WT but not Tiam1 WT resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in levels of pMLC compared with the EV control ( Supplementary Fig . 7a , b ) . Consistently , immunohistochemistry of ﬁbroblast - collagen matrices following expression of the different constructs showed a signiﬁcant increase in the number of pMLC positive cells , only upon expression of P - Rex1 WT ( Supplementary Fig . 7c ) . Importantly , depletion of endogenous P - Rex1 in both CHL1 and MCF7 cells was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in pMLC levels ( Fig . 7c , d and Supplementary Fig . 7d , e ) .

As suggested by the picrosirius staining and SHG imaging , expression of P - Rex1 WT but not Tiam1 WT was associated with increased collagen crosslinking and remodelling ( Fig . 7g – i ) .

Interestingly , bleb - bistatin treatment was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in P - Rex1 - driven cell migration , while the ROCK inhibitor had no effect on cell migration ( Fig . 8a , b ) . Similarly , treatment of CHL1 cells with blebbistatin but not the inactive enantiomer or the ROCK inhibitor impeded migration ( Fig . 8c , d ) , indicating that RhoA - ROCK - independent cell contraction is required for opti - mal P - Rex1 - driven cell migration in an endogenous setting . Taken together , these results indicate that P - Rex1 promotes cell contractility and consequently migration through Rac1 and FLII in a RhoA - ROCK - independent manner . Discussion When considering the contribution of Rac1 signalling to cancer dissemination , a challenge facing the ﬁeld is accounting for its contrasting effects on migration and invasion . This conundrum can be resolved by deﬁning contexts eliciting a given behaviour and identifying factors that dictate Rac1 downstream signalling cascades that govern its anti - and pro - migratory roles . Work presented here provides direct evidence implicating GEFs in modulating Rac1 downstream signalling . Through the use of a controlled cell system in which GEF expression is the only variable , we demonstrate that expression of Tiam1 and P - Rex1 induces distinct phenotypes in three different cell lines . In addition , via assessing the role of GEF * mutants of both proteins , we show that these effects are Rac1 - driven . Moreover , the quantitative proteomic screen we undertook has allowed us to begin to dissect the mechanisms by which GEFs regulate the Rac1 interactome to mediate Rac1 anti - and pro - migratory effects . This is demonstrated by the role we now show for FLII in regulating P - Rex1 - driven cell contraction , which accounts , at least in part , for P - Rex1 - Rac1 - mediated cell migration ( Fig . 8e ) . Through our work , we conﬁrm that Tiam1 activation of Rac1 stimulates cell – cell adhesion and reduces cell migration . This was particularly evident in the mesenchymal NIH3T3 cells in which we show that expression of Tiam1 induces an epithelial - like morphology accompanied by reduced cell migration , as pre - viously described by Sander et al . 29 A similar phenotypic switch is also seen in metastatic melanoma cells , in which Tiam1 is shown to impede cell migration through regulating the actin cytoskeleton to promote cell – cell contacts and induce an epithelial - like morphology 30 . In addition , we demonstrate that Tiam1 not only antagonizes HGF - induced cell scattering of MDCKII cells , as reported by Hordijk et al . 14 , but also impedes EGF - induced scattering of A431 cells .

( e ) Schematic representation of the P - Rex1 - Rac1 - FLII signalling cascade . Activation of Rac1 by P - Rex1 results in Rac1 binding to a set of downstream effectors , including FLII . P - Rex1 , via its scaffolding ability , binds to FLII through its GEL domain and brings it in close proximity to active Rac1 further stimulating the Rac1 - FLII interaction via the LRR domain of FLII . Through this interaction , P - Rex1 induces phosphorylation of MLC ( pMLC ) thereby enhancing cell contraction in a FLII - dependent manner . This cascade accounts , in part , for P - Rex1 - Rac1 - driven cell migration . NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms10664 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 7 : 10664 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms10664 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 11 suggest that Tiam1 activation of Rac1 is associated with reduced cell migration potentially through its ability to increase actin and cadherin deposition at cell – cell contacts , as previously suggested 14 , 30 . The selective ability of Tiam1 to promote Rac1 - dependent anti - migratory functions may be through regulation of the Rac1 interactome . Indeed , our proteomic analysis indicates an increased binding of Rac1 and IQGAP1 upon Tiam1 expression . Interestingly , active Rac1 has been shown to reduce the ability of IQGAP1 to interact with b - catenin 62 , thereby counteracting the negative regulatory role of IQGAP1 on cadherin - mediated cell – cell adhesions 63 . In addition , active Rac1 suppresses IQGAP1 - induced translocation of a - catenin which precedes cell scattering in MDCKII cells 64 . The increased Rac1 - IQGAP1 binding upon Tiam1 expression might therefore explain the anti - migratory phenotypic changes associated with these cells . In contrast to Tiam1 , P - Rex1 expression in NIH3T3 , A431 and MDCKII cells induces the formation of actin - rich membrane protrusions and cells exhibit reduced cell – cell contacts with an increased rate of cell migration and scattering . Consistent with our observations , P - Rex1 - Rac1 signalling has been shown to drive cell migration in an immortalized primary human ﬁbroblast cell line 31 . In vivo studies also show that mice deﬁcient in P - Rex1 have a decreased rate of melanoblast migration 32 . In addition , upregulation of P - Rex1 has been implicated in promoting metastasis in prostate cancer as well as in melanoma 32 , 33 . Importantly , our data describes a novel signalling cascade involving P - Rex1 , Rac1 and FLII that promotes cell migration . Evidence from the literature supports a crosstalk between FLII and small GTPases , where FLII has been shown to co - localize with Ras and other small GTPases at the leading edge of motile cells in actin - rich structures , including membrane rufﬂes and lamellipodia 46 . FLII was shown to interact with Ras in vitro through the LRR domain 65 . We show that similarly to Ras , Rac1 binds to the LRR domain of FLII . In contrast , P - Rex1 binds to the GEL domain of FLII . These observations suggest that both P - Rex1 and Rac1 could bind to FLII simultaneously forming a ternary complex that mediates P - Rex1 - Rac1 - driven cellular functions ( Fig . 8e ) . Intriguingly , FLII is considered a negative regulator of wound healing and cell migration 47 , 53 – 56 , 66 . However , we show that FLII is required for P - Rex1 - Rac1 - driven cell migration through modulating P - Rex1 - mediated cell contraction . This indicates that , similarly to Rac1 , FLII plays a dual role in regulating cell migration that is potentially dependent on the cellular context and FLII binding partners . Consistent with our data , ﬁbroblasts from FLII heterozygous ( FLII þ / (cid:2) ) mice exhibit reduced contractility in collagen contraction assays 47 . Activation of myosin II through the phosphorylation of MLC has been directly implicated in cell migration through its role in promoting stress ﬁbre formation and focal adhesion assembly in the centre of migrating cells . However , this process is mainly mediated through RhoA and its downstream effector ROCK 57 . Given that expression of P - Rex1 WT does not affect levels of active RhoA in migrating cells , together with the inability of ROCK inhibition to impede P - Rex1 - driven cell migration , our ﬁndings support a RhoA - ROCK - independent pathway by which MLC phosphorylation and cell contraction can be modulated in cells , potentially at the leading edge where we observed co - localization of P - Rex1 and FLII . This is particularly interesting since Rac1 has been shown to regulate chemotaxis through its effector PAK1 , which modulates the phosphorylation and localization of myosin IIB at the leading edge 58 . More recently , Rac1 activation has also been shown to stimulate MLC phosphorylation through inhibiting the MLC phosphatase 59 . Our data also indicates that P - Rex1 - mediated cell contraction is important for collagen crosslinking and remodelling . We propose that P - Rex1 - induced collagen remodelling is also dependent on FLII since FLII has recently been shown to interact with nonmuscle myosin IIA ( NMMIIA ) at cell protrusions , which is important for cell extension formation that enables FLII - dependent collagen remodelling by ﬁbroblasts 67 . Given the link between ECM remodelling and cancer metastasis ( reviewed in ref . 68 ) , the role of P - Rex1 in collagen crosslinking and remodelling described in this manuscript may have important implications for P - Rex1 - Rac1 - driven cancer cell invasion and metastasis . In conclusion , our data provides clear evidence supporting a role of Tiam1 and P - Rex1 in driving differential signalling cascades downstream of Rac1 through modulating the Rac1 interactome . Characterization of the P - Rex1 - FLII and Rac1 - FLII interactions also highlights a novel role of P - Rex1 as a scaffolding protein to stimulate Rac1 pro - migratory phenotypes . Taken together our data indicate that P - Rex1 not only activates Rac1 but is also able to direct proteins , such as FLII , to the active form of Rac1 to mediate speciﬁc cellular functions , including cell contraction , that enable P - Rex1 to enhance cell migration . Therefore , this study provides insight into previously unreported P - Rex1 - Rac1 cellular functions that mediate cell migration and highlights additional modes by which P - Rex1 and Rac1 might drive cancer dissemination .

Samples were prepared as indicated in the respective experimental sections and were resolved using NuPAGE Novex Tris - Acetate pre - cast gels ( Life Technologies , 3 – 8 % 10 - well EA0375BOX , 3 – 8 % 12 - well EA03752BOX ) or NuPAGE Novex Bis - Tris pre - cast gels ( Life Technologies , 12 % 10 - well NP0341BOX , 12 % 12 - well NP0342BOX , 4 – 12 % 10 - well NP0321BOX , 12 - well NP0321BOX ) . The BLUeye Pre - Stained Protein Ladder ( Geneﬂow Ltd , S6 - 0024 ) was run alongside the samples for protein size reference . Proteins were transferred from gels onto Immobolin PVDF membranes ( Millipore , IPFL00010 ) . Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies listed in Supplementary Table 2 as outlined therein and visualized on Hyperﬁlm ECL ( GE Healthcare , 28 – 9068 ) using the ECL western blotting analysis system ( GE Healthcare , RPN2109 ) . Adobe Photoshop software was used to crop full blots ( Supplementary Figs 8 and 9 ) . Band intensities were quantiﬁed using the ImageJ Gel analysis tool . SILAC labelling and protein identiﬁcation . Stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture ( SILAC ) media was prepared using high glucose DMEM without lysine ( K ) or arginine ( R ) ( PAA ) supplemented with 10 % dialysed FBS ( Life Technologies , 26400 - 044 ) , 1 % L - glutamine ( Sigma - Aldrich , G7513 ) and 10 m gml (cid:2) 1 penicillin - streptomycin . For labelling , cells were cultured for six doubling rounds using three different SILAC culturing media prepared using different amino acids stock solutions as outlined in Supplementary Tables 4 and 5 . The efﬁciency of SILAC labelling was evaluated by determining the amino acid incorporation rate as outlined in Supplementary Methods . For protein identiﬁca - tion by mass spectrometry , concentrated mixed SF - TAP eluates were prepared and processed as detailed in Supplementary Methods . Ingenuity analysis and heat map generation . Information obtained from the SILAC screens were used to generate a heat map representing a cluster of Rac1 binding partners falling under one of the following IPA functional groups : cell movement , cell morphology , cell signalling , cell - to - cell signalling and interaction , as well as cell assembly and organization . The heat map , generated using the R Project software , represents the Log2 of SILAC protein ratios relative to control cells expressing SF - Rac1 alone from a representative SILAC and reverse SILAC experiment . Statistical analysis . For assessing statistical signiﬁcance between two sets of data a two - tailed paired or two - sample equal variance student’s t - test was conducted with P value r 0 . 05 considered signiﬁcant and P value r 0 . 01 considered highly signiﬁcant . Test and P values are speciﬁed in ﬁgure legends where appropriate . References 1 . Geiger , T . R . & Peeper , D . S . Metastasis mechanisms . Biochim . Biophys . Acta 1796 , 293 – 308 ( 2009 ) . 2 .
