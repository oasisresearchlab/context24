Viale Berti Pi hat 6 / 2 , 40127 Bologna , Italy § Abstra t High - throughput experiments are shedding light on the topology of large regulatory networks and at the same time their fun tional states , namely the states of a tivation of the nodes ( for example trans ript or protein levels ) in di(cid:27)erent onditions , times , environments . We now possess a ertain amount of information about these two levels of des ription , stored in libraries , databases , ontologies . A urrent hallenge is to bridge the gap between topology and fun tion , i . e . developing quantitative models aiming at hara terizing the expression patterns of large sets of genes . However , approa hes that work well for small networks , be ome impossible to master at large s ales , mainly be ause parameters proliferate . In this review we dis uss the state of the art of large - s ale fun tional network models , addressing the issue of what an be onsidered as (cid:16)realisti (cid:17) and whi h the main limitations an be . We also show some dire tions for future work , trying to set the goals that future models should try to a hieve . Finally , we will emphasize the possible bene(cid:28)ts in the understanding of biologi al me hanisms underlying omplex multifa torial diseases , and in the development of novel strategies for the des ription and the treatment of su h pathologies . ∗ e - mail : Mar o .

Understanding this olle tive behavior is an important biologi al hal - lenge . In general , regulation of gene expression is exerted through several steps , the (cid:28)rst of whi h is trans ription into mRNA , modulated by the ombinatorial binding of trans ription fa tors and adapter proteins . This step is followed by possibly several post - trans riptional regulation events [ 1 , 2 , 3℄ , eventually leading to translation into a protein , whi h an in turn dire tly or indire tly regulate trans ription . Sin e the number of genes and of gene fun tions are fairly high , and genes may intera t in omplex ways , a useful approa h to understanding the behavior of ells is to hara terize this system from a global , or " network " point of view . Sin e trans riptional regulation is one of the basal ellular me hanisms by whi h ells perform the variety of responses to stimuli , through simple intera tions or omplex pathways [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9℄ , it is possible to simplify the s enario by onsidering this kind of intera tion alone , as a dire t a tion of a trans ription fa tor ( TF ) on a target ( a gene or another TF ) . To this aim , trans riptional regulation networks are de(cid:28)ned starting from the basi fun tional elements of trans ription [ 10℄ . This information is represented as a dire ted graph , ( Fig . 1 ) to whi h we will refer to as a Trans riptional Network ( TN ) , usually identifying ea h gene trans ript and their protein produ ts with an unique node , and ea h regulatory intera tion with a dire ted edge A → B between the node B ( the target ) and the node A ( the gene oding for a trans ription fa tor that has at least one binding site in the is - regulatory region of B ) . With this de(cid:28)nition , the TN stru ture an be obtained both by large - s ale or olle tions of small - s ale experiments [ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14℄ and its main stru tural features ( i . e its topology ) an be studied both to investigate its biologi al impli ations , or to gain deeper insight into the main evolutionary me hanisms that may have shaped it . In this review , we will show how in re ent times the bioinformati / biophysi ommunity is gradually moving from (cid:17)simple(cid:17) analysis of TN topologi al ar hite ture to studies in whi h this knowledge is integrated with (cid:16)fun tional(cid:17) onsiderations , on erning the onsequen es of trans riptional ar hite ture on gene expression patterns under several experimental on - ditions . Given the a tual a hievements of " omi s " te hnologies , it will be important in the near future to develop realisti large - s ale models of trans riptional regulation . We will re - 2 view the state of the art in this (cid:28)eld , mainly onsidering dis rete models de(cid:28)ned on graphs , borrowed from Statisti al Physi s , and how these models should ( and ould ) be adapted to biologi ally relevant questions . Our main goal is to dis uss how su h approa hes , given the network topology of the system , may be used to predi t its qualitative fun tional behav - ior , even in variable environmental onditions that are well known to a(cid:27)e t gene expression patterns [ 15 , 16℄ . In order to onne t TN topology with gene expression , it is ne essary to develop models that must be simple enough to be omputationally ( and possibly analyti ally ) tra table , but at the same time they must grasp the essential features of biologi al omplexity . An important requirement for su h models should be to isolate biologi al questions from omplex available data , and in lude just the most important features to hara terize the spe i(cid:28) question addressed . In our opinion , the models of Statisti al Physi s that are urrently used for these studies la k some important features , but they may be useful starting points nonetheless , given their (cid:29)exibility , relative ease of treatment , and ri hness in behavior . We will restri t our dis ussion to networks de(cid:28)ned by physi al / hemi al in - tera tions ( trans ription , metaboli , or protein - protein intera tion networks ) di - re tly obtained by experiments ( like Chip - CHIP or two - hybrid te hniques [ 17 , 18℄ ) or by suitable databases representing up - to - date biologi al knowledge ( like KEGG www . genome . ad . jp / kegg , Panther www . pantherdb . org , Rea tome www . rea tome . org , Mint http : / / mint . bio . uniroma2 . it / mint ) . Though the ultimate goal is to model these heterogeneous data sets , their omplexity puts them far from the ideal starting point for model development . It is preferable to build up from simple or simpli(cid:28)ed des riptions , by adding up ingredients gradually [ 19℄ . We will not take into a ount the problem of network inferen e or re onstru tion starting from indire t measurements ( see [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24℄ as referen es of network re onstru tion methods starting from di(cid:27)erent experimental designs of gene expression measurements ) . The (cid:28)rst se tion of this review fo uses on the topology of TNs , from the on epts of (cid:16)network motifs(cid:17) , to the global features su h as e . g . the hierar hi al stru ture of TNs . Subsequently , the problem of the evolution of TN topology is addressed . The se tion ends with des ribing studies that onsider the dire t relations of TN topology with gene expression and ell response to di(cid:27)erent stimuli . In the se ond se tion , fun tional models are introdu ed in whi h agents ( genes ) are represented by the network nodes and intera t on the basis of 3 TN topology . The main mathemati al models used so far are presented : we survey their prin ipal features and the main onstraints to be a ounted for in order to be biologi ally sound . In the (cid:28)nal se tion we resume the ideas presented , giving indi ations for the future dire tions that may be undertaken , and showing some very re ent examples that in our opinion are moving in the " right dire tion " . Fun tion and Topology In this se tion , we review the urrent approa hes to ( trans ription ) network analysis based on the study of topologi al features . We will des ribe the urrent analyses of the empiri al data , starting from the pure set of all possible intera tions and gradually adding (cid:16)fun tional(cid:17) information regarding nodes and their intera tion . Topology Alone At the lowest level of des ription , the main fun tional features of the ar hite ture of TNs an be inferred by studying their topology . Topologi al analysis is able to apture fun tional properties , and important ar hite tural features of the network [ 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31℄ . The most basi example of this kind of observable is the degree sequen e ( number of in oming / outgoing edges ) of ea h node [ 32℄ . In parti ular , degree sequen es that follow a s ale - free distribution are widespread in biologi al networks of di(cid:27)erent kinds , and have been onne ted to a variety of fun tional aspe ts [ 33℄ . An example of topologi al features that have revealed useful to gain biologi al insight are the so - alled network motifs [ 11 , 34℄ , small subgraphs ( i . e . subsets of the whole TN ) that appear with signi(cid:28) antly higher frequen y in empiri al networks as ompared to suitably randomized network realizations [ 35 , 36℄ . Be ause of their small size within the network ( less than 10 nodes ) , the dynami s of these ir uits an be understood with quantitative models , su h as ordinary or sto hasti di(cid:27)erential equations [ 34℄ . Experimental studies targeted on spe i(cid:28) network motifs [ 34 , 37 , 38℄ have on(cid:28)rmed the importan e of these sub - ir uits , and the fa t that in many ases they an work independently from the intera tions surrounding them . On the other hand , parallel studies have pointed out that in some ases a well - de(cid:28)ned fun tional identity of network motifs is di(cid:30) ult to (cid:28)nd [ 39℄ , so that the dis overy of these 4 topologi ally relevant subgraphs should not lead dire tly to their identi(cid:28) ation as fun tional sub - ir uits . For example , in some ases the subgraph nodes are found to be a tive in very di(cid:27)erent onditions . Moreover , on abstra t grounds , it is known that subgraphs intera t topologi ally with the graph ' s large - s ale organization [ 40℄ , so that their presen e might re(cid:29)e t an higher level of organization . Overall , despite network motifs are a very powerful on ept , it seems plausible that looking at them as independent building blo ks might be an oversimpli(cid:28) ation , and it is more realisti to regard them as fun tional modules that are deeply wired into the global stru ture of the network . Thus , even a full understanding of their fun tionality will likely not exhaust the subje t of large - s ale trans riptional regulation . Consequently , while the hallenge of onstru ting fun tional models using topology and other biologi al knowledge has been ta kled in di(cid:27)erent ways [ 28 , 41 , 42℄ , large - s ale fun tional models for gene expression do not ease to be needed in order to understand the behavior of larger modules or entire biologi al networks . Two important and related large - s ale properties of the known TNs are the hierar hi al feedforward layered stru ture of TFs [ 28 , 30 , 31℄ , and the feedba k , whi h in ba teria is often essentially limited to a rather large set of autoregulations [ 31 , 43℄ . The existing pyramidal hierar hi al stru tures , with most TFs at the bottom levels and only a few master TFs on top , have evoked the (cid:16)organization hart(cid:17) stru tures observed in so ial networks . Notably , while the distributions of small network features ( su h as three - nodes network motifs ) seem to be ommon among known trans ription networks of di(cid:27)erent organisms ( e . g . E . oli and yeast ) [ 25℄ , global topologi al observables , long - range feedba k among several TN layers [ 44℄ , hierar hy in the intera tions [ 45℄ and o - regulatory stru ture [ 9℄ seem related to in reasing organization omplexity , in parallel with the in rease in omplexity in uni ellular organisms , e . g . from E . oli to yeast . While the relevan e of (cid:16)pure(cid:17) network topology is lear from the studies presented so far , it would be naive to believe that network stru ture stri tly determines the dynami s of a network . Two basi reasons for this are that , at (cid:28)xed topology , signal integration fun tions may have large ombinatori s [ 46℄ , and at (cid:28)xed topology and signal integration fun tions , the dynami s depends on the stru ture of inputs . This is evident for example at the level of network motifs , where the ri hness of possible behaviors at (cid:28)xed topology has been elegantly proven using ordinary di(cid:27)erential equation models [ 47℄ . In order to onstrain the dynami s to a spe i(cid:28) behavior , it is ne essary to supplement topologi al information 5 with a spe i(cid:28) model for the promoters [ 48℄ and for the kineti parameters , and dynami time series experimental data should be available for model validation . We remark that this sort of data are generally not available or highly stylized for large - s ale analysis . For example , the best - known ele troni ally en oded database , that of E . oli [ 19℄ , represents signal integration as annotations to the a tivity of a trans ription fa tor at a given promoter ( a tivator , repressor od dual ) , and de(cid:28)nes the input stru ture by the nodes that are a tive in di(cid:27)erent growth onditions . In general , all the parameters ne essary for developing a detailed model are not available , thus a request for an optimal model is to be robust to su h la k of (cid:28)ne details . It should rely only on a limited number of parameters , that should be obtained as a sort of " prin ipal omponents " of the available experimental eviden es . Topology And Evolution The fun tional role of topology an be further investigated by taking an evolutionary point of view . The idea is that if we understand the (cid:16)target(cid:17) topologi al features of a network during evolution , this will give us information on its fun tioning . Evolution of a trans ription network is driven by three main biologi al me hanisms : ( i ) gene dupli ation , ( ii ) rewiring of edges by mutation / sele tion of TF / DNA intera tions and ( iii ) horizontal gene transfer , whi h is espe ially relevant for ba teria [ 49℄ . These me hanisms , in parti ular the (cid:28)rst one , have been shown to play a substantial role in TN evolution , although the extent to whi h they an shape the network is debated [ 10 , 27 , 39 , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54℄ . Looking at the elementary dupli ated topologi al stru tures onserved by sele tive pressure an give indi ations on erning their fun tional importan e . For example , network motifs have been reported not to emerge from divergent evolution [ 10 , 39 , 50℄ , leading to a substantial debate on their nature and their relationship to the rest of the network , along the lines that we mentioned above . On the other hand , the properties of hierar hy and feedba k in the E . oli network are ompatible with evolution by dupli ation / divergen e [ 31℄ , in whi h gene dupli - ation preserves the abundant self - regulations and the (cid:16)shallow(cid:17) layered organization , whi h an be hypothesized to fa ilitate fast signal propagation with short regulatory as ades , thereby optimizing the time onstraints for the expression of target genes in response to stimuli [ 28 , 30 , 31℄ . While TFs were sometimes a quired together with the adja ent operon 6 that they regulate [ 53℄ , the in lusion of horizontally transferred genes is estimated to be very slow and based on the re ruitment of existing trans ription fa tors of the host , as re(cid:29)e ted by fast evolution of their is - regulatory sequen es , and by the fa t that genes resulting from in reasingly an ient transfer events show an in reasing number of trans riptional regulators . Parti ularly interesting results ome from re ent studies that attempt to use the knowl - edge of many sequen ed genomes . Lozada - Chavez and ollaborators [ 55℄ studied the on - servation of E . oli and B . subtilis TN stru ture on a large number of known ba terial genomes . They found large plasti ity of regulatory intera tions , witnessed for example by the underrepresentation of signi(cid:28) antly onserved trans riptional regulatory intera tions among di(cid:27)erent phyla of ba teria , and by the la k of onstraints on the o - evolution of om - binatorial intera tions . Their results indi ate that trans riptional regulation is more (cid:29)exible than the geneti omponent of the organisms , and its omplexity and stru ture plays an important role in the pro ess of phenotypi adaptation . Analogous results were obtained by Babu and oworkers [ 56℄ , who noted that di(cid:27)erent trans ription fa tors have emerged independently as dominant regulatory hubs in 175 prokaryotes , suggesting that they have onvergently a quired the observed s ale - free ( or at least heavy - tailed ) out - degree sequen e . Also , ommon lifestyle brings to onservation of orthologous intera tions and network motifs over a large phylogeneti distan e , indi ating that network stru tures are onserved if the sele tive pressure of environmental stimuli is present . A riti al point in these studies is that the network topology is known to an a eptable extent for very few TNs only ( essentially the E . oli and B . subtilis sets used in the two studies ) so that arbitrary , though reasonable , proje tion algorithms have to be used in order to infer the network topology of genomes with known sequen e , reating the danger of ir ular arguments . Topology Studies In luding Fun tional Features A further step towards fun tional models that relate networks to gene expression is the bioinformati integration of data on erning the a tivity and roles of promoters , targets and TFs . The most important step in this dire tion is probably the work by Lus ombe and oworkers [ 57℄ , who integrated , in a pioneering study on yeast , trans riptional regulatory information and gene - expression data in multiple onditions . These authors have observed 7 that not all network intera tions are always a essible to the system , but only spe i(cid:28) net - work subsets are swit hed on simultaneously . A ordingly , only few trans ription fa tors serve as permanent hubs , while most a t transiently and are a tive only under ertain stim - uli . Thus the e(cid:27)e tive intera tion topology , i . e . the network formed by the trans ription fa tors that are a tive at the same time in response to a spe i(cid:28) perturbation , varies greatly in di(cid:27)erent onditions and environments , and may di(cid:27)er substantially from the global inter - a tion topology . This point has broad impli ations . For example , from the point of view of inferen e , it implies that models onstru ted based on data obtained under di(cid:27)erent onditions or even from di(cid:27)erent organisms may be strongly de eptive sin e they in lude intera tions that do not o ur at the same time [ 58℄ . This point must be taken into a ount when onsidering the network stru ture to be used for modelling ( dis ussed in the following se tion ) . By studying these sub - networks , they show that environmental responses fa ilitate short - time signal propagation , whereas pro esses driven by internal stimuli su h as ell y le and sporulation pro eed by su essive slower stages ( see [ 59℄ for a re ent review on these aspe ts of trans riptional regulation ) . The former signals are also overrepresented for dire t trans riptional feedba k [ 44℄ . Another study by Janga and oworkers [ 60℄ lassi(cid:28)es TFs into external - , internal - and hybrid - sensing , and shows how di(cid:27)erent network motifs use di(cid:27)erent sensing stru tures , whi h are also related to regulatory modes ( a tivation , repression , or dual regulation ) [ 9℄ . Finally , one an onsider the o - regulatory network of TFs sharing ommon targets [ 61℄ , whi h enables to distinguish between regulators that integrate di(cid:27)erent ellular pro esses and those a ting spe i(cid:28) ally on one or a few major pro esses . The above mentioned approa hes are powerful , but at the same time they are limited by a purely data - driven approa h . A model - guided analysis is potentially more powerful , be ause it a ounts for all the possible phenomena given ertain initial assumptions motivated by the system . As a positive example we would like to mention the ase of (cid:29)ux balan e analysis for metaboli networks [ 62 , 63℄ , a onstraint - based modelling approa h that in orporates a sim - pli(cid:28)ed rea tion stoi hiometry in terms of maximization of (cid:29)uxes . This te hnique simpli(cid:28)es enough the system making it treatable as ompared to the unrea hable full stoi hiomet - ri problem , and at the same time allowing nontrivial and orre t predi tions on mutant viability and phenotypes . The key feature of this strategy is that it does not attempt to predi t the exa t network behavior , but rather it uses known physi o hemi al onstraints to 8 separate the states that a system an a hieve from those that it an not . Analogous e(cid:27)orts for protein - protein intera tion networks are being dis ussed in the literature [ 64℄ . Su h an e(cid:27)e tive level of des ription is la king for TNs . Therefore the next step , and hallenge , is to perform integrative bioinformati analysis dire tly using models to guide them , and on - versely to test models with data , in order to (cid:28)nd the most suitable (cid:16) oarse - grained(cid:17) level of des ription , as we will outline in the next se tion . Hypotheses and onstraints for e(cid:27)e tive fun tional models The remainder of this review will address the problem of the possible abstra t models that an des ribe empiri al data , onsidering both the network intera tions and the a tivation state of the nodes . We will review some of the available andidates for a network model that in lude agents ( the genes ) intera ting between themselves ( i . e . binding to promoters and enhan ing / inhibiting trans ription ) through the network onne tions , trying to elu idate the questions that an be posed using these tools , and the main needs in their formulation ( see Box 1 , 2 ) . As anti ipated , we believe that the most relevant needs are on eptual simpli ity and omputational manageability , and thus we will not onsider models of TNs that take into a ount the (cid:28)ne details of ( bio ) hemi al rea tions , whi h immediately lead to a proliferation of unknown parameters ( e . g . rea tion onstants ) [ 65 , 66℄ . While these models are well established for small regulatory ir uits , it is not feasible to simply (cid:16)s ale them up(cid:17) and model global expression states . Rather , we on entrate on e(cid:27)e tive oarse - grained models whi h redu e to the minimum the number of relevant parameters . It should be obvious , given the previous dis ussion , that su h models annot aspire to des ribe a spe i(cid:28) TN in detail . Rather , they should be able to hara terize ( in a statisti al fashion ) the behaviour of lasses of networks or subnetworks with similar topologi al or fun tional stru tures . We will also limit the dis ussion to models in whi h only dis rete states are allowed for ea h trans ript on entration ( or level of gene a tivation ) , in ontrast with models in whi h ontinuous values are onsidered ( like those based on Mass A tion Law , su h as Mi haelis Menten kineti s ) . We do not ex lude that ontinuous variable models an be useful , but we believe that the assumptions of treatability and low number of e(cid:27)e tive parameters should hold also in this ase . 9 Dynami s versus Optimization Most of the urrently available oarse - grained models fo us on dynami al features . The prototype of these models are Random Boolean Networks ( RBN ) , whi h have a long history starting from the original Kau(cid:27)man model of the late ' 60s [ 67 , 68 , 69℄ . RBNs have been studied extensively on theoreti al grounds sin e the ' 80s [ 70 , 71 , 72 , 73℄ , and have re ently re eived renewed attention by the introdu tion of new onne tivity topologies [ 74 , 75℄ , that led to new results in terms of possible dynami states of the network . RBNs are typi ally studied under a wide set of random initial onditions , allowing to hara terize the basins of attra tion of the (cid:28)nal states of the system . The lassi Kau(cid:27)man model is formulated to apture on abstra t grounds the " dynami " behaviour of the ell : N two - state genes ( on - o(cid:27) , 0 - 1 , true - false as in Boolean logi ) hange state as a fun tion of the states of their regulators . In the original model , the network ensemble is onstrained to K random regulators per gene , and the ontrol fun tions are hosen randomly among all possible Boolean fun tions . Depending on the initial onditions , several attra tors like (cid:28)xed points ( i . e . a (cid:28)xed state for ea h element of the system ) or y les ( in whi h a limited number of system states are periodi ally visited ) may exist , with basins of attra tion of di(cid:27)erent size . These di(cid:27)erent attra tors of the system are ommonly interpreted as spe i(cid:28) biologi al tasks performed by the ell , or as spe i(cid:28) ell types ( phenotypes ) arising from a di(cid:27)erentiation pro ess , and the system is hara terized on the basis of the number of these attra tors , their typi al length , and the probability of swit hing among them due to noise or external perturbations . In the ase of " lassi al " RBNs , in whi h all nodes update syn hronously , the possible phenomenology in ludes (cid:28)xed points or y les of length at most 2 N . Also , a number of variants of this model are now available [ 69 , 76℄ . Ea h variant of the model an be further hara terized by 1 ) the topology of the network , 2 ) the hoi e of the Boolean fun tions ( that may di(cid:27)er among nodes ) and 3 ) the update rule . Varying K ( the inward onne tivity degree ) , the system may undergo a transition between a state of ordered dynami s ( in whi h perturbations to the system tend to die out ) to one of haoti dynami s , hara terized by large y les ( of exponential length in N ) in whi h even a small perturbation may propagate throughout the whole system inde(cid:28)nitely . The study of pos - sible dynami states as a fun tion of more omplex and biologi ally relevant topologies is 10 developing in the latest years [ 65 , 74 , 76℄ , in whi h the relevant feature of the system are ontrolled by a limited number of parameters ( e . g . the exponent of the power - law distri - bution of node onne tivities ) . Also the set of Boolean fun tions , hosen to represent gene a tivation / inhibition , an in(cid:29)uen e system dynami al transition : for example , the hoi e of more (cid:16) analizing(cid:17) fun tions ( i . e . less variable with respe t to (cid:29)ips in the state of a small number of inputs ) an ontrol the length of the typi al y les [ 69 , 76 , 77℄ . Regarding the update rules of the network , several options are available [ 69℄ : syn hronous update , in whi h all nodes are updated together ; random asyn hronous update , in whi h one or more nodes are hosen randomly at ea h step , and y li update , in whi h one or more nodes are up - dated at (cid:28)xed periods . These update rules share ommon properties ( e . g . the number of (cid:28)xed points [ 78 , 79℄ ) , but also show a di(cid:27)erent behavior in the size of the basins of attra tion and in the existen e and size of y les . For random asyn hronous update rules there annot be y les , but network states may get trapped into loose attra tors in whi h the same group of states may be visited repeatedly but with a di(cid:27)erent order . This property essentially puts random - update asyn hronous models in relation to (cid:16)equilibrium(cid:17) models , in whi h it is su(cid:30) ient to supply the behavior of the attra tors for a omplete hara terization ( see below ) . Even if the ompletely syn hronous updating rule may be unrealisti for a real TN , a ertain degree of oordination in TN a tivation must surely be present . The interplay between y li updating ( resembling housekeeping tasks like ell y le or ir adian rhythms ) and random update ( due to response to external stimuli ) might be interesting to investigate , sin e it is very likely that a real TN ombines a mixture of both updating rules . Other dis rete dynami al models , that allow more omplex behaviour , are Thomas ' model [ 80 , 81℄ , and Petri - nets [ 82℄ . Thomas ' model is essentially an asyn hronous - update dis rete network in whi h also multiple values of the state variables are allowed . The asyn hronous update is generally not thought as randomly ordered , but sometimes used to introdu e a time hierar hy . Petri - nets are ellular automata des ribing the (cid:29)ows of masses through a network , and thus espe ially well - adapted to des ribe metaboli networks . However , they also have been applied very re ently to di(cid:27)erent regulatory networks , in luding TNs [ 83 , 84℄ . Both Thomas ' model and Petri nets are formulated to introdu e more realisti features as ompared to the simplest Boolean models , prominently time and time - hierar hies related to biologi al omplexity [ 80 , 84℄ , while preserving a oarse - graining des ription of the states . As su h , they are espe ially useful to model mid - sized networks , in whi h a ontinuous 11 approa h ( as with ordinary di(cid:27)erential equations ) may fail , but a Boolean des ription might be too rude . They have been mainly applied to inferen e problems from gene expression data , or to small network models , and generally not in a large - s ale ontext ( see for example [ 85℄ for a more extended dis ussion ) . More systemati large - s ale studies are needed in order to establish the distin t features of their typi al behaviour . A di(cid:27)erent approa h is to formulate the model as an optimization problem , in whi h the addressed question is to (cid:28)nd the (cid:16)equilibrium(cid:17) gene expression patterns ompatible with a set of (cid:16) onstraints(cid:17) set by the network intera tions . This formulation is simpler than onsidering system dynami s , but possibly still useful to extra t relevant biologi al information ( see Box 1 ) . It is more suitable for problems in whi h time is not a entral issue , for example studying the response of the ell to environment or ( pharma ologi al ) treatments that may alter its equilibrium state , as opposed to transient gene expression hanges during the ell y le . In general , su h a model an be useful in studies on erning the stru ture of stable states and basins of attra tion of the system as a fun tion of network topology [ 79 , 86℄ , and how they may hange if the network stru ture is perturbed . It has also been used to hara terize the behavior of random - update Boolean networks [ 87℄ . The referen e models for su h equilibrium studies are the so alled (cid:16)spin models(cid:17) . These are one of the most " versatile " models in Statisti al Physi s , and have been su essfully applied in several ontexts . Their terminology is rooted in their original physi al appli ation , des ribing the dis rete atomi states ( magneti spins ) of ferromagneti materials . Biologi ally relevant results have been obtained , to ite only some of them , in their adaptation and appli ation for memory formation and information storage in neurons [ 88 , 89℄ , in the des ription of stability properties in biologi al membranes [ 90 , 91℄ and in the spread of politi al opinion in so ial networks [ 92 , 93℄ . In the simplest spin model , only two states are allowed for ea h element of the system ( orresponding to a tive / ina tive expression states of a gene , as in RBN ) but it is possible to onsider an arbitrary number of states ( Potts ' model [ 94℄ ) , that in ase of gene expression models ould mimi multiple levels of a tivation ( e . g . due to a di(cid:27)erent ombination of trans ription fa tors bound to the gene promoter regions ) . Spin models have been re ently applied to models of gene regulation [ 95 , 96 , 97℄ , to des ribe how some network features an a(cid:27)e t global stability properties . 12 Choosing the intera tions An important problem for any realisti modelling of a TN is how to represent the biologi al intera tions , e . g . how the signals arriving at promoter regions are integrated for trans ription initiation . For many organisms , the exa t stru ture of TN has not been des ribed yet : while the presen e or absen e of an intera tion is often known , its a tual role in inhibition or a tivation is not so often annotated in the data sets . Moreover , it is lear that TF regulation is a so - alled many - body intera tion ( involving more than two TFs at a time ) , sin e the ombinatorial a tion of several TFs may be paramount in determining the output . In this sense , the typi al hoi e of general lasses of Boolean fun tions in RBNs is biologi ally realisti . It an be also shown , using the Shea - A kers ' model [ 46 , 98℄ that signal integration an realize all Boolean fun tions . Spin models as well an have many - spin intera tions . On the other hand , it is not known whi h fun tions are e(cid:27)e tively realized in a biologi al ontext . For example , many Boolean fun tions an be onstant with respe t to a number of inputs , while in a biologi al situation , if an intera tion exists , it is very probably used in at least some ontext , so that the problem of sele ting (cid:16)realisti (cid:17) fun tions is still open [ 99℄ . Large - s ale data on the e(cid:27)e tive ombinatorial fun tions involved in trans riptional pro ess are largely unavailable , ex ept for few well hara terized promoters . To date , the work of Davidson and oworkers is the most omplete in hara terizing the trans riptional intera tion logi for a large number of network intera tions in developmental pathways [ 100 , 101℄ . For some E . oli [ 102℄ and Yeast TN data sets , annotations are available on erning the a tivating or inhibiting role of TFs parti ipating in trans riptional intera tions [ 35 , 103℄ , so it would be possible to onsider lasses of fun tions ompatible with these onstraints , or to simplify the model using pairwise intera tions based on these annotations . Given the heterogeneity of intera tions , the most suitable spin models for this purpose may fall into a subgroup referred to as spin glasses [ 104℄ , in whi h spin - spin intera tions vary along the network and may give rise to the phenomenon of frustration , i . e . the fa t that not all ooperative / ompetitive relationships an be satis(cid:28)ed at the same time , leading to multiple equivalent lusters of ompatible states . These models have been widely hara ter - ized theoreti ally , also leading to the development of analyti al solution tools ( " repli a " and " avity " methods , see [ 104 , 105℄ ) . Note that , however , if onne tions are not symmetri ( as in real TNs ) , the s enario an be mu h more omplex as ompared to the results available 13 with spin - glass models . Whi h topology for a plausible model ? As emerging from previous dis ussions , the (cid:28)rst key point in obtaining biologi ally plau - sible results is thus related to the introdu tion of an adequate network topology . If we onsider , for example , the (cid:28)xed in - degree ensemble of lassi al Kau(cid:27)man networks , this topology is learly unrealisti as ompared to known TNs . First , there are no input nodes ( i . e . only aimed at re eiving signals ) , but all nodes equally re eive and send signals . Se ond , the number of in oming onne tions is the same for ea h node , while empiri al TNs have been observed to have di(cid:27)erent in oming and outgoing degree distributions , with the se ond group mu h more heterogeneous than the (cid:28)rst [ 33 , 106℄ . Thus , to make the above men - tioned models dire tly appli able to empiri al networks , they must be onstrained as mu h as possible by all the biologi al knowledge available from experimental data , in luding some of the empiri al features dis ussed above , su h as network motifs , hierar hi al stru ture of nodes , degree orrelations , and loops . In many network - based models , topology is ru ial in altering equilibrium as well as dy - nami al properties of a system [ 107 , 108 , 109℄ . Some re ent investigations [ 74 , 95 , 96 , 97℄ have introdu ed more realisti degree distributions for network onne tivity in RBN and spin models , showing how some properties of the system depend riti ally from the exponent of the power - law onne tivity degree distribution . The s ale - free property of onne tivity de - gree distributions , as observed in many biologi al networks [ 33 , 42℄ is only a (cid:28)rst step : many other stru tures an be embedded in a s ale - free network ( and in any other network topology as well ) su h as for example assortativity / dissortativity [ 110 , 111℄ or non trivial relationships between network observables ( e . g . entrality measures [ 112℄ ) or the presen e of feedba k loops [ 31 , 44℄ . The role of these topologi al features is still to be investigated . As an example , re ent experimental results [ 113℄ show the existen e of a " metri s " on hro - mosomes , su h that genes a tivated by the same TF tend to be loser in terms of base - pair distan es . The same kind of e(cid:27)e t an be aused by hromatin remodelling , whi h intro - du es orrelations in the a tivation of lose genes , even if they are not oregulated [ 114 , 115℄ . These observations suggest the existen e of orrelations in TN onne tivity , fa ilitating the oordinated expression of genes with similar tasks . 14 Introdu ing environment and perturbations In a ell , the signalling ma hinery transfers to and integrates in the regulatory networks a ri h variety of external stimuli , su h as hanges in nutrient on entration , hormonal signals or pathogeni aggressions . This orresponds to introdu ing external onstraints in the model , or (cid:16)(cid:28)elds(cid:17) , whi h may in(cid:29)uen e the a tivation states of spe i(cid:28) groups of nodes . For this purpose , a realisti model should in lude in the (cid:28)rst pla e a set of re eptor or input nodes , and it should a ount for the possibility of having spe i(cid:28) subnetworks a tivated ( or silen ed ) by proper input patterns . As stated previously , we believe this feature is biologi ally relevant , sin e depending on the state of the ell only some subnetworks may be e(cid:27)e tive [ 57℄ , rather than having the whole set of possible intera tions a tivated at every time . Moreover , it is not unusual that several signals rea h the system on omitantly and repeatedly ( e . g . during di(cid:27)erentiation or apoptosis ) forming spe i(cid:28) input patterns . Ideally , a model ould allow in sili o experiments in order to reprodu e qualitatively experimental results , or to verify system properties like robustness to hanges in the input pattern ( as it has been done for the ase of the yeast ell y le [ 116 , 117℄ ) . The e(cid:27)e t of varying input stru tures has been re ently addressed experimentally with a systemati approa h applied to a dis rete Boolean model . In [ 65℄ , the regulatory ma hinery , interpreted as an " information pro essing network " , has been subje ted to a large number of random input ombinations , and the analysis of system response has revealed its apability to perform sharp lassi(cid:28) ation tasks even in presen e of added noise . One of the simplest questions along these lines ould be to study the e(cid:27)e t of a perturba - tion to a single network element . In RBNs , the results of single - site perturbation have been studied by allowing a node to swit h its state arbitrarily and observing the e(cid:27)e t on system dynami s ( e . g . the possibility of a transition to a di(cid:27)erent system state ) . However , su h an approa h is not feasible for modelling the out ome of re ent experiments , in whi h a single gene is onditionally a tivated or inhibited ( see [ 23 , 118℄ ) , and only re ent studies [ 119℄ are beginning to apply perturbations to RBNs that may resemble biologi ally plausible situa - tions . This is analogous to the ase of organisms with fully sequen ed genomes , in whi h systemati methods have been used to analyze , both from a proteomi and genomi point of view , the e(cid:27)e t of suitable perturbations on spe i(cid:28) pathways ( as in [ 120℄ ) . Variations on the theme of (cid:17)atta k - toleran e models(cid:17) [ 121 , 122℄ have shown that single network elements an 15 in(cid:29)uen e the system properties to a di(cid:27)erent extent , revealing a omplex hierar hy based on system topologi al stru ture . It is surely an important question to he k if the most relevant elements in a network from a purely topologi al point of view ( in the sense of a stati des ription of the network ) are also the most relevant in in(cid:29)uen ing the dynami al properties of the system . In fa ts , network dynami s following a spe i(cid:28) perturbation ould also depend on other fa tors , su h as the intera tion rules ( e . g . the a tivation fun tions ) hosen at ea h node . More omplex (cid:17)ideal experiments(cid:17) an be performed , by onsidering the on omitant swit hing of groups of nodes hosen on the basis of their role inside the network : e . g . how a stimulus an be propagated through the network a ting on (cid:17) ore(cid:17) nodes as ompared to (cid:17)peripheral(cid:17) nodes , ranked by di(cid:27)erent entrality measures . Su h in - sili o experiments may help in redu ing the number of real experiments to be performed , that in general would (cid:17)explode exponentially(cid:17) with the number of genes to be perturbed together , eviden ing the potentially most interesting situations . Vi eversa , di(cid:27)erent network - based ranking of the nodes ould be he ked experimentally , providing deeper insight into the analogies between models and real TNs . Dis ussion and Con lusions In this review , we have reported the in reasing need of quantitative models for the in - terpretation of large - s ale experiments on gene regulatory networks , that are ontinuously in reasing in number , a ura y and quality of the generated data . We surveyed some of the available models for su h purposes . The lands ape omprises a wealth of possibilities , but a uni(cid:28)ed view is still missing , mainly due to the fa t that most available models an only be studied on a very abstra t level , and the possibility of a omparison between experiments and models is opening only in re ent years . The key issues arising in this (cid:28)eld that we aimed to address are the following . First , not all global properties of networks may be simple onsequen es of the behavior of small sub - parts or sub - networks , so that there is the need of models able to deal with the regulatory network as a whole . Se ondly , models that are very useful for small - s ale systems generally fail when s aled up , be ause of parameter proliferation : a large - s ale model must meet the requirement of being based on a small number of relevant degrees of freedom . Thirdly , 16 as a onsequen e of the two previous statements , su h large - s ale models annot be all - in lusive , but must be targeted to spe i(cid:28) biologi al questions . The key ingredients for the model should then be isolated from the plethora of available data , sele ting just the most important ones to hara terize the spe i(cid:28) question addressed . A ordingly , we have proposed some onstraints that TN models should satisfy in order to be (cid:16)realisti (cid:17) , and some possible questions that ould be isolated . A (cid:28)rst key point is simpli ity and treatability ( i . e . ontaining a small number of parameters to be " tuned " ) but at the same time they must be able to des ribe the main features derived from experimental observations , for example regarding the intera tions between nodes ( network topology ) and the way a node may elaborate the in oming signals ( the a tivation fun tion ) . In our opinion , some key features have not been taken into a ount yet , regarding both the stru ture of trans - regulation relationships and the detailed modelling of the environmental onditions in whi h the system is embedded , in parti ular how the model may re eive stimuli and respond to them , whi h is a key point in des ribing realisti ally a biologi al system . Based on what we des ribed as reasonable assumptions for a realisti model , it may be ome possible to address some more spe i(cid:28) questions of biologi al relevan e . For example , a hara terization of the stru ture of system " attra tors " as a fun tion of network topology ould help answer to questions su h as whether it is possible to hara terize the states of a ell as unique ( e . g . a unique " healthy " or " basal " state ) . This issue may be important for pra ti al appli ations , be ause apparently identi al ells ( i . e . with similar phenotype ) ould respond di(cid:27)erently to external threats , depending on the e(cid:27)e tive regulatory state they o upy ( a very re ent paper [ 123℄ dis usses this issue in detail , posing the question also in terms of the evolutionary advantages of su h (cid:17)redundan y(cid:17) ) . This point is emerging in re ent studies on genomi pro(cid:28)ling of tumors [ 124℄ , where new tumor subgroups are found that are not re ognizable by usual phenotypi observations of ells and tissues . This re(cid:28)nement of tumoral ell lassi(cid:28) ation is leading to new insights in the underlying biologi al me hanisms , and also opening new dire tions for the hoi e of optimal therapeuti strategies ( e . g . in terms of pharma oresistan e or tumor aggressiveness level ) . An interesting example omes from the work of Kitano and ollaborators [ 125 , 126 , 127℄ , in whi h topologi al " double funnel " stru tures alled bow - ties are repeatedly found in ell signaling system at various levels . The hypothesis is that spe i(cid:28) elements in this stru ture 17 are more suitable as targets for therapy , mainly on the basis of their role in the regulatory network rather than on their biologi al fun tion only . Also the role of external perturbations a(cid:27)e ting the system ( from single - gene kno k out to the typi al (cid:29)ow of biologi al information entering a ell ) and the role of other modulating fa tors ( hromatin stru ture and post - translational me hanisms ) are open to more detailed investigations with the help of suitable models . A fundamental question , in many biologi al ontexts , is to understand if external stimuli produ e a " perturbation of the basal state " ( to whi h the ell should thus be able to return to ) , or if they may indu e a swit h to a di(cid:27)erent stable state , for example in the ase of tumors , Alzheimer disease or autoimmune pathologies . Su(cid:30) iently realisti models should help to larify how many external / internal fa tors , and of whi h entity and a ting for how long , should be needed in order to rea h su h " point of no return " . We on lude by noti ing that re ent experiments present a design that makes them in - reasingly more suited for theoreti al modelling , rather than being fo used on issues of dire t biologi al / medi al relevan e . This is a lear sign of the times , re(cid:29)e ting the in reasing in - terest towards novel approa hes in understanding biologi al pro esses , di tated by the new quantitative points of view that are nowadays gathered under the large hat of Systems Biol - ogy . As an example , Isalan and oworkers [ 128℄ onstru ted a large set of re ombinations of promoters and regulatory regions in E . oli ( possibly the whole set of permutations allowed for its TN ) and showed that most new networks are tolerated by the ba teria and that ex - pression levels orrelate with fa tor position in the wild - type network hierar hy . We believe that the hallenge of testing a simple and biologi ally realisti model in the des ription of these and similar experiments on TNs is be oming feasible , and the results will help pave the way to a new biologi al on eptual framework .

The elements of the modelled system ( genes and / or proteins ) are represented as nodes , and the existen e of a relationship between elements ( e . g . inhibi - tion by one gene trans ript on the produ tion of another gene trans ript by means of a protein / DNA binding ) is represented by a link between nodes . Links may be dire ted or not , that is relations an in general be asymmetri ( " 1 " in(cid:29)uen es " 2 " but the opposite is not true ) . The stru ture of the relationships ( network topology ) determines the main system properties at a global s ale , also imposing a hierar hy at the single node level . In (cid:16)fun tional(cid:17) models , variables are de(cid:28)ned on the nodes , representing e . g . gene expression . 25 BOX 1 : Spin Models and Random Boolean Networks In a spin model , the system has equilibrium states ( right ) orresponding to minima of an " energy fun tion " ( left ) ; the stru ture of the energy fun tion is de(cid:28)ned by the regulatory relationships in the graph , and hara terizes the stable state features as well as the transitions between states as a onsequen e of perturbations . In a Random Boolean Network , the system is hara terized by the set of possible states and the dynami transitions between them , with parti ular attention to (cid:28)xed points , y les ( i . e . periodi dynami s ) and the size of their basins of attra tion . 26 BOX 2 : Dis rete versus Continuous models , a resume . Continuous Models In kineti models , the network is des ribed by the set of hemi al dynami rate equations asso iated to the network intera tions . These models , in the form of ordinary or sto hasti di(cid:27)erential equations , are the standard des ription for small to medium networks [ 129 , 130℄ . They require the detailed knowledge of many parameters , whi h is one of the main issues in the (cid:28)eld [ 66℄ . For this reason , it is unlikely that these models ( with today ' s te hnology ) are s alable to entire network des riptions . Furthermore , for the ase of trans riptional intera tions , extra models , su h as the Shea A kers model , are required for the des ription of promoter a tivity . The model of Shea and A kers omputes the probability of trans ription initiation using a stati equilibrium des ription of binding at a known promoter , and given the binding a(cid:30)nities and intera tions of all trans ription fa tors binding in the is - regulatory region . If the mass a tion law is assumed for the produ ts and stationarity of gene expression an be assumed , this model ould be used to ompute output ompatible states , given the input on entrations of TFs . However , it still su(cid:27)ers from the parameter proliferation problem . Dis rete Models The mostly used dis rete dynami models are Boolean Networks , that have been su - essfully employed in empiri al studies [ 117℄ . In this model , gene expression levels are simpli(cid:28)ed to on / o(cid:27) dynami s , and regulation is represented by Boolean fun tions . Syn - hronous dynami s mimi s the time hierar hy of events of gene regulation . These models an be run on ensembles of network topologies and / or a tivating fun tions , or spe i(cid:28) realizations may be onsidered for both features . More omplex models for dis rete - state dynami s are given by Thomas ' model , or Petri nets [ 80 , 81 , 82 , 85℄ . Spin Models are aimed at hara terizing the ompatible states for a set of dis rete agents ( the spins ) representing the gene expression levels , intera ting in pairs or groups through some onstraints , a ting through the network topology , representing the is - regulatory intera tions governing gene expression . These models ( very abstra t but (cid:29)exible ) an be used to des ribe the essential features of TNs and to produ e qualitative observables re - lated to the olle tive behavior of gene regulation in di(cid:27)erent spe i(cid:28) problems ( response to perturbation , robustness , inferen e of intera tions , et . ) . In parti ular , for topologies that are ri h in y les it is possible to (cid:28)nd frustration ( namely the impossibility to sat - isfy all onstraints at the same time ) and onsequently the phenomenology of spin - glass models , in whi h multi - s ale lusters of stable states emerge . 27
