However , it is still unknown how actomyosin contractility generates force and 31 maintains cellular morphology . Here , we demonstrate an optogenetic method to induce relaxation 32 of actomyosin contractility . The system , named OptoMYPT , combines a catalytic subunit of the 33 type I phosphatase - binding domain of MYPT1 with an optogenetic dimerizer , so that it allows light - 34 dependent recruitment of endogenous PP1c to the plasma membrane . Blue - light illumination was 35 sufficient to induce dephosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chains and decrease in traction 36 force at the subcellular level . The OptoMYPT system was further employed to understand the 37 mechanics of actomyosin - based cortical tension and contractile ring tension during cytokinesis . We 38 found that the relaxation of cortical tension at both poles by OptoMYPT accelerated the furrow 39 ingression rate , revealing that the cortical tension substantially antagonizes constriction of the 40 cleavage furrow . Based on these results , the OptoMYPT system will provide new opportunities to 41 understand cellular and tissue mechanics . 42 43 44 INTRODUCTION 45 Actomyosin contractility underlies force generation in a wide range of cellular and tissue 46 morphogenesis in animals . Prominent examples include the tail retraction of directionally migrating 47 fibroblasts and the constriction of a contractile ring during cytokinesis ( Green , Paluch , and Oegema 48 2012 ; Ridley et al . 2003 ) . The actin - rich cell cortex , a thin network underneath the plasma 49 membrane , is also relevant to the actomyosin contractility involved in maintaining cell morphology ; 50 namely , the actomyosin contractility at the cell cortex not only tunes mechanical rigidity , but also 51 renders cells rapidly deformable as manifested in cell division and amoeboid migration ( Kelkar , 52 Bohec , and Charras 2020 ; Paluch , Aspalter , and Sixt 2016 ) . Thus , it is of critical importance to 53 disentangle the mode of action of actomyosin in order to understand how cells generate force and 54 shape their morphology . 55 The actomyosin contractility in nonmuscle cells is mainly attributed to the force generated 56 by nonmuscle myosin II ( NMII ) ( Vicente - Manzanares et al . 2009 ) . NMII contains two heavy 57 chains , two essential light chains , and two regulatory light chains ( Vicente - Manzanares et al . 2009 ; 58 Heissler and Manstein 2013 ) . The myosin regulatory light chains ( MLCs ) are phosphorylated by 59 myosin light chain kinase ( MLCK ) and Rho - kinase ( ROCK ) , thereby inducing conformational 60 change in NMII and increasing its motor activity ( Vicente - Manzanares et al . 2009 ) . Small chemical 61 3 compounds have been widely used to perturb the actomyosin contractility , such as blebbistatin ( an 62 inhibitor for NMII ATPase activity ) , Y - 27632 ( a ROCK inhibitor ) , and ML - 7 ( an MLCK inhibitor ) 63 ( Straight et al . 2003 ; Uehata et al . 1997 ; Saitoh et al . 1987 ) . While these compounds have allowed 64 researchers to better understand the function of NMII , it is still technically challenging to control 65 their actions at the subcellular resolution because of their rapid diffusion . 66 To overcome this limitation , recent efforts have been devoted to the development and 67 application of optogenetic tools to manipulate cell signaling related to actomyosin contractility 68 ( Krueger et al . 2019 ) . The most popular approach is to control the activity of RhoA , a member of 69 Rho family small GTPases . Light - induced recruitment of RhoGEF triggers RhoA activation , which 70 in turn activates ROCK and inactivates myosin light chain phosphatase ( MLCP ) ( Wagner and 71 Glotzer 2016 ; Kimura et al . 1996 ; Valon et al . 2017 ) ( Fig . 1a ) . These reactions eventually induce 72 myosin light chain phosphorylation , followed by an increase in the actomyosin contractility . It has 73 been reported that local accumulation of RhoGEF by light increases contractile force at the 74 subcellular scale ( Wagner and Glotzer 2016 ; Oakes et al . 2017 ; Valon et al . 2017 ) . These 75 technologies allow activation of NMII at the equator and the induction of partial constriction in 76 rounded cells in metaphase ( Wagner and Glotzer 2016 ) . Valon et al . further demonstrated that 77 trapping of overexpressed RhoGEF to the outer membrane of mitochondria resulted in a decrease in 78 actomyosin contractility ( Valon et al . 2017 ) . In addition , depletion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma 79 membrane by optogenetic membrane translocation of 5 - phosphatase OCRL has been shown to 80 modulate cell contractility and inhibit apical constriction during Drosophila embryogenesis 81 ( Guglielmi et al . 2015 ) . Although many of these tools enhance actomyosin contractility through 82 RhoA or phospholipids , tools that reduce actomyosin contractility below the basal level have not 83 yet been developed . 84 Here , we report a new optogenetic tool to directly inactivate NMII ; the system , called 85 OptoMYPT , is designed to recruit an endogenous catalytic subunit of type Ic phosphatase ( PP1c ) to 86 the plasma membrane with light , thereby dephosphorylating and inactivating NMII . We 87 demonstrate that MLCs are dephosphorylated and the traction force exerted by cells is reduced at 88 the local area where blue light was illuminated . Moreover , this system was applied to the mechanics 89 of cytokinesis to understand how and to what extent actomyosin - based cortical tension antagonizes 90 contractile ring tension and contributes to the cleavage furrow ingression rate . 91 92 93 94 95 4 RESULTS 96 Design of an OptoMYPT system for reducing intracellular contractile force . 97 To manipulate the intracellular contractile force , we focused on MLCP , which is composed of three 98 subunits , a catalytic subunit PP1c , a regulatory subunit ( MYPT1 ) , and a smaller subunit of 20 - kDa 99 ( M20 ) ( Ito et al . 2004 ) . MYPT1 contains a PP1c - binding domain ( PP1BD ) and myosin heavy chain 100 ( MHC ) - binding domain ( Fig . 1b ) . MYPT1 holds PP1c through the PP1BD , and recruits it to NMII 101 to dephosphorylate MLC , leading to the inactivation of NMII . Phosphorylated MLC is mainly 102 localized near the plasma membrane such as at cortical actin and stress fibers , where the NMII 103 exerts mechanical force ( Du and Frohman 2009 ) . 104 Our strategy for the reduction of contractile force is based on inducing membrane 105 translocation of the PP1BD in MYPT1 with light , resulting in the co - recruitment of endogenous 106 PP1c at the plasma membrane and dephosphorylation of MLC . We refer to this system as the 107 OptoMYPT system . It has been reported that the 1 to 38 amino acids ( a . a . ) in the PP1BD are 108 particularly important for binding to PP1c , and that the 170 to 296 a . a . in the PP1BD serve as a 109 phosphorylated MLC - binding domain ( Hirano , Phan , and Hartshorne 1997 ) . As an optogenetic 110 switch in this study , we mainly employed the improved Light - Induced Dimer ( iLID ) system , which 111 binds to its binding partner , SspB , upon blue light illumination and dissociates from SspB under the 112 dark condition ( Guntas et al . 2015 ) . The iLID - based OptoMYPT system consists of a light - 113 switchable plasma membrane localizer , Stargazin - mEGFP - iLID , and an actuator , SspB - mScarlet - I - 114 PP1BD , which is translocated to the plasma membrane for the co - recruitment of the endogenous 115 PP1c with blue light ( Fig . 1c ) . The Stargazin - mEGFP - iLID is suited for the subcellular protein 116 recruitment , because the large N - terminal transmembrane anchor limits the diffusion of SspB 117 proteins ( Natwick and Collins 2021 ) . Alternatively , we developed a cryptochrome 2 ( CRY2 ) - based 118 OptoMYPT system , in which CRY2 - mCherry - PP1BD was recruited to the plasma membrane with 119 blue light through binding to the plasma membrane localizer CIBN - EGFP - KRasCT ( Kennedy et al . 120 2010 ) . 121 We first compared the efficacy of light - induced membrane translocation between three 122 different lengths of PP1BDs : 1 - 38 , 1 - 169 , and 1 - 296 ( hereafter referred to as MYPT38 , MYPT169 , 123 and MYPT296 , respectively ) . In line with the previous study ( Wu et al . 2005 ) , SspB - mScarlet - I - 124 PP1BDs accumulated at the nucleus ( Fig . S1a , b ) . To circumvent this problem , the nuclear export 125 signal ( NES ) was fused with the C terminus of the PP1BDs to export them to the cytoplasm ( Fig . 126 S1a , b ) . As a control , we confirmed that Madin - Darby Canine Kidney ( MDCK ) cells exhibited the 127 translocation of SspB - mScarlet - I from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane upon blue light 128 illumination ( Fig . 1d , e ) . SspB - mScarlet - I - MYPT169 showed the best membrane translocation in 129 three differential lengths of PP1BDs ( Fig . 1e ; Movie S1 ) . We recognized that a small fraction of 130 5 SspB - mScarlet - I - MYPT38 still resided in the nucleus ( Fig . 1d , yellow arrowhead ) , and CRY2 - 131 mCherry - MYPT38 formed aggregates and puncta in a blue light - dependent manner for an unknown 132 reason ( Fig . S2 ) . Next , we investigated whether PP1BDs of MYPT1 indeed bind to PP1c and 133 recruit it to the plasma membrane . In control cells , PP1c fused with miRFP703 ( PP1c - miRFP703 ) , 134 which was mainly localized at the nucleus , did not show any change in the subcellular localization 135 upon blue light illumination ( Fig . 1d , f ) . As expected , SspB - mScarlet - I - MYPT38 , - MYPT169 , and - 136 MYPT296 demonstrated similar levels of translocation of PP1c - miRFP703 from the cytoplasm to 137 the plasma membrane upon blue light illumination ( Fig . 1d , f ; Movie S2 ) . We further evaluated the 138 effect of overexpression of PP1BD on basal phosphorylation of MLC ( ppMLC ) by western blotting 139 analysis . Interestingly , MLCs were almost completely dephosphorylated in MYPT296 - 140 overexpressing cells ( Fig . S1c ) . Indeed , the cells expressing MYPT296 showed flattened 141 morphology with membrane protrusions similar to the morphology of cells treated with ROCK 142 inhibitor or myosin inhibitor ( Worthylake and Burridge 2003 ; Totsukawa et al . 2004 ) ( Fig . S1a ) . 143 This result is consistent with the previous report pointing out the existence of the ppMLC - binding 144 domain at the 170 – 296 a . a . , which may facilitate recruitment of PP1BD to NMII and 145 dephosphorylation of MLC without any stimulation ( Hirano , Phan , and Hartshorne 1997 ) . Taken 146 together , these results led us to conclude that MYPT169 is well suited for the OptoMYPT system . 147 6 148 Figure 1 . Development of the OptoMYPT system .

Stargazin - mEGFP - iLID is anchored to the plasma 151 membrane . Upon blue light illumination , the SspB - mScarlet - I - fused PP1c - binding domain 152 ( PP1BD ) of MYPT1 translocates to the plasma membrane along with endogenous PP1c , and 153 inactivates NMII at the cell cortex .

The blue light was locally illuminated for 15 168 min , followed by fixation and immunofluorescence staining with the anti - ppMLC antibody ( Fig . 169 2a ) . We herein adopted a CRY2 - based OptoMYPT system ( Kennedy et al . 2010 ) , because the 170 slower dissociation kinetics of the CRY2 - CIB system compared to that of the iLID - SspB system 171 was preferable for this experiment . Local illumination of blue light induced spatially restricted 172 recruitment of CRY2 - mCherry and CRY2 - mCherry - MYPT169 ( Fig . 2b , right column ) . In addition , 173 the local recruitment of CRY2 - mCherry - MYPT169 , but not CRY2 - mCherry , attenuated the 174 ppMLC signal ( Fig . 2b , left column ) . The quantification of ppMLC fluorescence intensity in dark 175 and light illuminated areas ( Fig . 2a ) revealed a significant reduction in the ppMLC level ( Fig . 2c ) . 176 The decrease in ppMLC by OptoMYPT prompted us to examine the effect on contractile 177 force by light . To do this , traction force microscopy was applied to randomly migrating MDCK 178 cells expressing the OptoMYPT system . The cells were seeded on polyacrylamide gel containing 179 infra - red fluorescence beads , so that we could infer the traction force by the displacement of 180 fluorescence beads and the mechanical properties of the polyacrylamide gel ( Fig . 2d ) . The blue 181 light was locally focused on the lamellipodial region , where the cells were generating strong 182 traction force . SspB - mScarlet - I - MYPT169 was successfully recruited to the locally illuminated area 183 ( Fig . 2e , upper ) . Under this condition , the traction force was reduced after blue light illumination 184 ( Fig . 2e , lower ; Fig . 2f , Movie S3 ) . These results indicate that the OptoMYPT system can 185 dephosphorylate ppMLCs by local blue light illumination , leading to a reduction of traction force . 186 187 188 8 189 Figure 2 .

( f ) Quantification of the traction force before and 203 after blue - light illumination . n = 13 cells . 204 205 206 Membrane protrusion induced by local dephosphorylation of ppMLC with OptoMYPT 207 We next examined whether local dephosphorylation of ppMLC and reduction of contractile force 208 have an impact on cell morphology by using OptoMYPT . The control MDCK cells that expressed 209 SspB - mScarlet - I , Stargazin - mEGFP - iLID , and Lifeact - miRFP703 demonstrated local accumulation 210 9 of SspB - mScarlet - I by blue light illumination , but did not show morphological change ( Fig . 3a ) . On 211 the other hand , the OptoMYPT - expressing MDCK cells reproducibly showed peripheral membrane 212 protrusions in the blue - light exposed area ( Fig . 3b ; Movie S4 ) . We evaluated light - induced 213 membrane protrusion with a kymograph and time - course graph , which showed the movement of the 214 cell edge upon blue light illumination in OptoMYPT - expressing cells ( Fig . 3c , d ) . The protruding 215 membrane was subsequently maintained under dark conditions . Interestingly , we often recognized 216 membrane retraction on the opposite side of the blue - light illumination area ( Fig . 3e , arrowhead ; 217 Movie S5 ) . The OptoMYPT - induced membrane protrusion and retraction are consistent with the 218 previous reports showing Rac1 activation by inhibiting NMII or ROCK ( Even - Ram et al . 2007 ; 219 Martin et al . 2016 ) and regulation of cell polarity by membrane tension ( Houk et al . 2012 ) . 220 221 222 223 Figure 3 .

The thin and bold lines indicate the individual and 233 averaged data , respectively . n = 15 , 13 , and 12 cells for Control - light ( local blue light illumination ) , 234 10 OptoMYPT - dark ( dark condition ) , OptoMYPT - light ( local blue light illumination ) , respectively . ( e ) 235 Representative images of the induction of membrane retraction ( yellow arrowhead ) on the opposite 236 side of the blue - light illuminated area . 237 238 239 Acceleration of the ingression rate of cleavage furrows during cytokinesis by the optical 240 relaxation of cortical tension . 241 We next applied the OptoMYPT system to elucidate the mechanical regulation of the actin cortex 242 during cytokinesis . In this process , a contractile ring , which is mainly composed of F - actin and 243 NMII , transiently forms in the equatorial plane and generates tension to constrict the ring and divide 244 a cell into two daughter cells ( Fig . 4a , solid arrows ) . The tension in the contractile ring is 245 counteracted by the tension generated by cortical actomyosin ( Fig . 4a , dashed arrows ) . Recent 246 studies showed that genetic and pharmacological perturbations to the cortical actomyosin disrupted 247 proper cytokinesis ( Taneja et al . 2020 ; Yamamoto et al . 2019 ; Sedzinski et al . 2011 ; O’Connell , 248 Warner , and Wang 2001 ) , suggesting that the cortical tension plays a vital role . However , there is 249 still controversy in regard to the importance of cortical tension , because it is difficult to estimate the 250 strength of cortical tension relative to the contractile ring . 251 To address this issue , we perturbed the cortical tension by using the OptoMYPT system . 252 Blue light was locally and repeatedly illuminated at both poles from the onset of chromosome 253 segregation ( Fig . 4a ) . SspB - mScarlet - I and SspB - mScarlet - I - MYPT169 were trapped in the polar 254 region ( Control - pole and OptoMYPT - pole , respectively ) ( Fig . 4b ; Movies S6 , S7 ) . Because the 255 overexpression of OptoMYPT might reduce basal actomyosin activity ( Fig . S1c ) , cells expressing 256 SspB - mScarlet - I - MYPT169 under a dark condition throughout cytokinesis ( OptoMYPT - dark ) were 257 also used as a control ( Fig . 4b ; Movie S8 ) . 258 To evaluate the reduction of cortical tension by local activation of the OptoMYPT , we 259 focused on the dynamics of membrane blebbing during cytokinesis ( Fig . 4c ) . Because it has been 260 reported that high cortical tension causes membrane blebbing ( Tinevez et al . 2009 ) , we presumed 261 that the appearance of membrane blebbing and the number of blebs could be used as an indicator of 262 cortical tension . We counted the number of membrane blebs since the onset of cleavage furrow 263 ingression , and found a decrease in the number of blebs in OptoMYPT - pole cells as compared to 264 Control - pole and OptoMYPT - dark cells ( Fig . 4c , d ) . This result is consistent with previous 265 observations , in which NMIIA - knockout or knockdown alleviated cortical tension during 266 cytokinesis ( Yamamoto et al . 2019 ; Taneja et al . 2020 ) . Furthermore , smaller membrane blebbing 267 emerged in Control - pole and OptoMYPT - dark cells from the early phase of cleavage furrow 268 ingression , and the number of blebs gradually increased as furrow ingressed , whereas OptoMYPT - 269 11 pole cells exhibited larger membrane blebbing from the late phase of cleavage furrow ingression 270 ( Figs . 4e and S3 ) . Based on these results , we concluded that the cortical tension in both poles 271 decreased through local application of the OptoMYPT system . 272 Finally , to estimate the strength of cortical tension relative to that of contractile ring tension , 273 we adapted a coarse - grained physical model describing the mechanics of cytokinesis ( Sedzinski et 274 al . 2011 ; Yoneda and Dan 1972 ; Turlier et al . 2014 ) . In this model , the furrow ingression rate ( v ) is 275 considered to be proportional to the difference between the contractile force of the ring ( F r ) and the 276 resisting force exerted by the cortices ( F c ) , v ∝ F r - F c ( see the Materials and Methods , Fig . S4 , and 277 the Supplementary Discussion ) . Thus , we measured the furrow ingression rate under each 278 condition . The ingression rate of the cleavage furrow was significantly higher in OptoMYPT - pole 279 cells ( 2 . 26 ± 0 . 25 μm / min ) than in Control - pole cells ( 1 . 55 ± 0 . 20 μm / min ) and OptoMYPT - dark 280 cells ( 1 . 93 ± 0 . 33 μm / min ) ( Fig . 4f , g ) , indicating that the reduced cortical tension accelerates the 281 cleavage furrow ingression rate . These results highlight the negative contribution of the cortical 282 tension to the cleavage furrow ingression . Based on the coarse - grained physical model and 283 experimental data , we estimated that the cortical tension corresponds to at least 14 . 6 % of the ring 284 tension during cytokinesis ( see the Supplementary Discussion ) . 285 286 12 287 Figure 4 .

Schematic model of mechanical regulation of the contractile ring and the actin 309 cortex during cytokinesis . In control cells , high cortical tension acts as a decelerator of the ring 310 constriction . The high cortical tension and cytoplasmic pressure induce blebbing from the early 311 phase of cytokinesis . The increased cytoplasmic pressure associated with ring constriction in the 312 late phase is released by the increased number of blebs . In pole - illuminated OptoMYPT cells , the 313 cleavage furrow ingression is accelerated due to the decrease in the cortical tension . As cleavage 314 furrow ingression progresses , large blebs emerge due to the increased cytoplasmic pressure . 315 316 317 DISCUSSION 318 In this study , we developed a new optogenetic tool , OptoMYPT , and demonstrated light - dependent 319 relaxation of cellular forces at the subcellular level . The OptoMYPT is substantially different from 320 existing optogenetic tools related to the cell mechanics in two ways . First , the OptoMYPT reduces 321 contractile forces below the basal level , and therefore provides additional flexibility for in situ 322 control of actomyosin contractility and cellular morphology . Second , the OptoMYPT directly 323 regulates NMII through MLC dephosphorylation , whereas optogenetic modulation of RhoA activity 324 or PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 may affect pathways other than NMII , since RhoA and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 are known to control 325 various downstream effectors such as ROCK , mDia , and the ezrin - radixin - moesin ( ERM ) proteins 326 ( Oshiro , Fukata , and Kaibuchi 1998 ; Yonemura et al . 2002 ; Narumiya , Tanji , and Ishizaki 2009 ) . 327 14 Using the OptoMYPT system , we experimentally revealed the negative contribution of the 328 cortical tension to the cleavage furrow ingression rate during cytokinesis ; i . e . , the decrease in 329 cortical tension at both poles by OptoMYPT accelerates furrow ingression ( Figs . 4 and 5 ) . It has 330 been reported that the reduction of cortical tension by laser ablation in the polar region decelerates 331 cleavage furrow ingression in cytokinesis of C . elegans embryos ( Khaliullin et al . 2018 ) . This 332 discrepancy could be due to the difference in the force balance between the pole and equator ; in C . 333 elegans embryos , NMII is actively removed from the polar region and accumulates at the equator 334 due to the cortical flow , and thus cortical tension is much weaker than ring tension ( Chapa - Y - Lazo 335 et al . 2020 ; Reymann et al . 2016 ) . Meanwhile , our results indicate that cortical tension in cultured 336 mammalian cells is comparable to contractile ring tension ( Fig . 4 ) , which is in good agreement with 337 the previous work ( Sedzinski et al . 2011 ) . Such a high cortical tension is advantageous because it 338 confers shape stability to mitotic cells ( Sedzinski et al . 2011 ) . This has been corroborated in a 339 recent paper demonstrating that high cortical stiffness in cancer cells allows them to divide in a 340 confined environment ( Matthews et al . 2020 ) . The benefit of cortical tension is not required in C . 341 elegans embryos , because they are covered and protected by a rigid eggshell . However , high 342 cortical tension is a double - edged sword , because excessive cortical tension induces cytokinetic 343 shape oscillation and abscission failure ( Mukhina , Wang , and Murata - Hori 2007 ; Taneja et al . 344 2020 ; Girard et al . 2004 ) . The estimated cortical tension relative to ring tension ( F c / F r ) , ~ 14 . 6 % , 345 may achieve a balance between morphological maintenance and timely cytokinesis . 346 We also focused on the dynamics of membrane blebbing during cytokinesis ( Fig . 4 ) . 347 Although the functional significance of blebbing is poorly understood , except in relation to cell 348 migration , the mechanisms underlying membrane blebbing have been increasingly reported . 349 Membrane blebbing is initiated by local rupture of the actin cortex and / or detachment of the actin 350 cortex from the plasma membrane ( Charras and Paluch 2008 ) . The growth of membrane blebs 351 requires a condition under which hydraulic pressure caused by actomyosin - based cortical tension 352 overcomes plasma membrane tension ( Tinevez et al . 2009 ) . We showed that numerous small blebs 353 emerged in the “early phase” of furrow ingression in control MDCK cells , and these were 354 suppressed by relaxation of cortical tension with OptoMYPT ( Figs . 4e , 5 , and S3 ) . This 355 phenomenon is clearly consistent with the aforementioned mechanisms . Meanwhile , MDCK cells 356 expressing OptoMYPT exhibited large blebs in the “late phase” of cleavage furrow ingression when 357 both poles were illuminated with blue light ( Figs . 4 and 5 ) . The late onset of blebbing in the pole - 358 illuminated cells probably occurs because the progression of cleavage furrow ingression raises 359 hydraulic pressure , and thereby induces detachment of the actin cortex from the plasma membrane , 360 leading to the pressure release through bleb formation . To the best of our knowledge , the mechanics 361 of bleb formation in the “late phase” of the furrow ingression are a hitherto unrecognized process . 362 15 There still remain some issues to be addressed with respect to the OptoMYPT . First is the 363 issue of substrate specificity in OptoMYPT . We could not exclude the possibility that the 364 OptoMYPT dephosphorylates additional substrates other than MLC . However , based on the fact 365 that the OptoMYPT activation at both poles during cytokinesis did not induce bleb formation , it is 366 unlikely that OptoMYPT dephosphorylates and inactivates the ERM proteins cross - linking the 367 plasma membrane and actin cortex to prevent membrane bleb formation ( Rodrigues et al . 2015 ) . 368 The next issue is the localizer of optogenetic switches . In the current OptoMYPT system , 369 dephosphorylation of MLC was induced by recruiting MYPT169 to the plasma membrane upon 370 illumination with blue light . However , it is plausible that the OptoMYPT dephosphorylates and 371 inactivates only the NMII existing in the vicinity of the plasma membrane , and not the NMII in the 372 other subcellular locations . The use of a localizer that is closer to endogenous active NMII or a 373 specific localization such as the apical membrane of epithelial cells could result in an OptoMYPT 374 system with better specificity and spatial resolution than the current version . 375 The OptoMYPT system will provide opportunities not only to understand the mechanics of 376 morphogenesis , but also to shape the morphology of cells and tissues with precision and flexibility 377 as desired . Recent papers have applied optogenetic systems in vivo , and succeeded in inducing 378 arbitrary forms of the apical constriction ( Izquierdo , Quinkler , and De Renzis 2018 ) . By combining 379 red light - responsive optogenetic tools such as PhyB - PIF with blue light - responsive tools ( Levskaya 380 et al . 2009 ; Uda et al . 2017 ) , it will be possible to create more sophisticated morphology with an 381 increase or decrease in contractile force in the same cells and tissues . 382 383 384 Materials and Methods 385 Plasmids 386 The cDNAs of human MYPT1 and PP1c were derived from HeLa cells ( Human Science Research 387 Resources Bank ) . SspB - mScarlet - I - PP1BDs were obtained by Gibson assembly cloning , combining 388 the SspB obtained from pPBbsr tgRFPt - SspB and cDNAs of PP1BDs . Stargazin - mEGFP - iLID was 389 obtained by Gibson assembly cloning , combining the Stargazin derived from Stargazin - GFP - 390 LOVpep ( plasmid # 80406 : Addgene ) and pPBbsr Venus - iLID - CAAX . CRY2 and CIBN - EGFP - 391 KRasCT were obtained from pCX4puro - CRY2 - CRaf and pCX4neo - CIBN - EGFP - KRasCT ( Aoki et 392 al . 2013 ) and inserted into the pCAGGS vector ( Niwa , Yamamura , and Miyazaki 1991 ) . The 393 cDNAs of Lifeact and NES were obtained by oligo DNA annealing and ligation , and inserted into 394 each vector . The cDNA of hyPBase , an improved PiggyBac transposase ( Yusa et al . 2011 ) , was 395 synthesized ( FASMAC ) , and inserted into the pCAGGS vector . The nucleotide sequences of newly 396 generated constructs are provided in Table S1 . 397 16 398 Cell culture 399 MDCK cells ( no . RCB0995 : RIKEN Bioresource Center ) were maintained in minimal essential 400 medium ( MEM ; 10370 - 021 : ThermoFisher Scientific ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum 401 ( FBS ; 172012 - 500ML : Sigma ) , 1x Glutamax ( 35050 - 061 : ThermoFisher ) , and 1 mM sodium 402 pyruvate ( 11360070 : ThermoFisher ) in a 5 % CO 2 humidified incubator at 37°C . The cells were 403 split as previously reported ( Aoki et al . 2017 ) . 404 405 Transfection 406 Because PP1BDs of MYPT1 fused with fluorescent proteins tend to aggregate for long - term 407 expression , most experiments were performed by transient expression . The MDCK cells were 408 electroporated by using Nucleofector IIb ( Lonza ) according to the manufacturers’ instructions ( T - 409 023 program ) with a house - made DNA - and cell - suspension solution ( 4 mM KCl , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 410 107 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 13 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 11 mM HEPES pH . 7 . 75 ) . After electroporation , the cells 411 were plated on collagen - coated 35 - mm glass - base dishes . 412 413 Establishment of stable cell lines 414 For transposon - mediated gene transfer , MDCK cells were transfected with PiggyBac donor vectors 415 and PiggyBac transposase - expressing vectors at a ratio of 3 : 1 . One day after transfections , cells 416 were treated with 10 μg / mL blasticidin S ( InvivoGen , San Diego , CA ) or 1 . 0 μg / mL puromycin 417 ( InvivoGen ) for selection . The bright bulk cell population was collected using a cell sorter ( MA900 ; 418 SONY ) . 419 420 Live - cell fluorescence imaging 421 Cells were imaged with an IX83 inverted microscope ( Olympus , Tokyo ) equipped with an sCMOS 422 camera ( Prime : Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ; or ORCA - Fusion BT : Hamamatsu Photonics , 423 Hamamatsu , Japan ) , a spinning disk confocal unit ( CSU - W1 ; Yokogawa Electric Corporation , 424 Tokyo ) , and diode lasers at wavelengths of 488 nm , 561 nm , and 640 nm . An oil immersion 425 objective lens ( UPLXAPO60XO , N . A . 1 . 42 ; Olympus ) or an air / dry objective lens 426 ( UPLXAPO40X , N . A . 0 . 95 ; Olympus ) was used . The excitation laser and fluorescence filter 427 settings were as follows : Excitation laser , 488 nm ( mEGFP ) , 561 nm ( mScarlet - I ) , and 640 nm 428 ( miRFP703 ) ; dichroic mirror , DM 405 / 488 / 561 dichroic mirror ( mEGFP , mScarlet - I , and 429 miRFP703 ) ; emission filters , 500 – 550 nm ( mEGFP ) , 580 – 654 nm ( mScarlet - I ) , and 665 – 705 nm 430 ( miRFP703 ) . During observation , cells were incubated with a stage incubator set to 37 °C and 431 containing 5 % CO 2 ( STXG - IX3WX ; Tokai Hit ) . 432 17 For global illumination of the blue light , blue LEDs ( 450 nm ) were manually illuminated 433 from the top of the stage or pulsed blue light ( 488 nm ) was illuminated through the objective lens . 434 For local light illumination in the interphase cells , a digital micromirror device ( Polygon 400 ; 435 Mightex ) mounted on the IX83 microscopic system , and pT - 100 ( CoolLED ) were used . For local 436 light illumination during cytokinesis , an SP8 FALCON inverted confocal laser scanning 437 microscope ( Leica ) equipped with a water immersion objective lens ( HC PL APO 63x / 1 . 20 W 438 motCORR ; Leica ) was used . Local light illumination was started using the FRAP function just after 439 chromosome segregation onset . We illuminated every 3 . 11 sec , and acquired images every 15 . 54 440 sec . The positions of regions of interest ( ROIs ) were manually corrected every 2 min in all samples . 441 For all time - lapse imaging , MDCK cells were plated on 35 mm glass - base dishes ( IWAKI ) . 442 Before time - lapse imaging , the medium was replaced with FluoroBrite ( Invitrogen ) supplemented 443 with 10 % FBS , 1x Glutamax . 444 445 Immunofluorescence 446 Cells were fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min , followed by permeabilization by 5 447 min incubation in 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 - containing PBS . Samples were soaked for 30 min in Can 448 Get Signal immunostain ( solution A ) ( Toyobo , Japan ) , and then incubated with ppMLC antibody 449 ( 1 : 50 dilution ; Cell Signaling Technology # 3674 ) in Can Get Signal immunostain ( solution A ) for 1 450 h at room temperature . Next , the cells were washed 3 times with PBS , and then incubated for 1 h at 451 room temperature with Alexa 555 - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG ( 1 : 100 dilution ; ThermoFisher ) in Can 452 Get Signal immunostain ( solution A ) . Finally , the cells were washed 3 times with PBS and 453 subjected to fluorescence imaging . 454 455 Traction force microscopy 456 Polyacrylamide gel substrates were prepared in accordance with previously published protocols 457 ( Tambe et al . , 2011 ; Trepat et al . , 2009 ) . In brief , the gel solution was prepared with 4 % 458 acrylamide , 0 . 1 % bisacrylamide , 0 . 8 % ammonium persulfate , 0 . 08 % TEMED ( Nacalai Tesque ) , 459 and 5 % deep red fluorescent carboxylate - modified beads ( 0 . 2 μm diameter ; F8810 ; Thermo Fisher 460 Scientific ) . 13 μL of the mixture was added to a 35 mm glass - base dish ( IWAKI ) and then covered 461 with a glass coverslip of 15 mm diameter ( Matsunami ) . After gel polymerization at room 462 temperature , the surface was coated with 0 . 3 mg / mL type I collagen ( Nitta Gelatin , Osaka , Japan ) 463 using 4 mM sulphosuccinimidyl - 6 - ( 4 - azido - 2 - nitrophenylamino ) hexanoate ( Sulfo - SANPAH ; 464 Pierce ) . Cells were seeded on the gel , and imaged with a spinning disk confocal microscope . To 465 quantify the traction force , two Fiji plugins , i . e . , the iterative PIV and FTTC plugins , were used . 466 18 Note that Young’s modulus of the gel was estimated as ~ 2 kPa according to a previous report ( Tse 467 and Engler 2010 ) . The traction force in locally illuminated areas was used for the quantification . 468 469 Immunoblotting 470 Cells were lysed in 1x SDS sample buffer . After sonication , the samples were separated by 5 – 20 % 471 gradient SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( Nagaiki precast gels ; Oriental Instruments , Ltd . ) 472 and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes ( Millipore ) . After blocking with Odyssey 473 Blocking Buffer - TBS ( LICOR Biosciences ) for 1 h , the membranes were incubated with primary 474 antibodies overnight at 4°C , followed by the secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature . For 475 primary antibodies , ppMLC antibody ( 1 : 500 dilution ; Cell Signaling Technology # 3674 ) , phospho - 476 Ezrin / Radixin / Moesin antibody ( 1 : 500 dilution , Cell Signaling Technology # 3276 ) , and α - Tubulin 477 antibody ( DM1A ) ( 1 : 5000 dilution ; sc - 32293 : Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) were diluted in Odyssey 478 Blocking Buffer - TBS . For secondary antibodies , IRDye680LT - conjugated goat polyclonal anti - 479 rabbit IgG ( H + L ) ( 1 : 5000 dilution ; LI - COR Bioscience ) and IRDye800CW - conjugated donkey 480 polyclonal anti - mouse IgG ( H + L ) ( 1 : 5000 dilution ; LI - COR Bioscience ) were diluted in Odyssey 481 Blocking Buffer - TBS . Proteins were detected with an Odyssey infrared scanner ( LI - COR 482 Bioscience ) . 483 484 Imaging analysis 485 All fluorescence imaging data were analyzed and quantified by Fiji ( Image J ) . For all images , the 486 background was subtracted and images were registered by StackReg , a Fiji plugin to correct 487 misregistration , if needed . To quantify the cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity changes in Figure 1 , 488 the ROI was selected in each image and normalized by the mean fluorescence intensity of the first 489 10 images under the dark condition . To quantify the area of membrane protrusion in Figure 3 , the 490 ROI was chosen so as to coincide with the local light - irradiated area . In OptoMYPT - dark cells , the 491 ROI was a region of lamellipodia similar to that of light - illuminated cells . Fluorescence images of 492 Lifeact - miRFP703 were binarized and the difference between the area at each time point and at t = 493 0 was calculated . 494 495 Physical modeling 496 According to previous modeling efforts on the force balance in a dividing cell ( Sedzinski et al . 497 2011 ; Yoneda and Dan 1972 ) , the temporal change in radius of the contractile ring , R r , is described 498 as 499 𝛼 ! " ! ! # = − ( 𝑇 $ − 2 𝑅 $ 𝑇 % cos𝜃 ) - ( 1 ) , 500 19 where α is ring viscosity , T r is the tension of the contractile ring , T c is the tension in the actomyosin 501 cortex , and θ is the angle between the equatorial plane and polar surface at the furrow ( see Fig . S4 502 for the details ) . Note that our model was simplified from Eq . S1 in the report of ( Sedzinski et al . 503 2011 ) , since we consider symmetric pole shapes . For brevity , let F r and F c denote T r ( ring tension ) 504 and 2 R r T c cos θ ( cortical tension ) , respectively ( Fig . S4 ) . Then , the furrow ingression rate , v , can be 505 expressed as 506 𝑣 ∝ 𝐹 $ − 𝐹 % . - ( 2 ) 507 508 509 Acknowledgments 510 We thank all members of the Aoki Laboratory for their helpful discussions and assistance .
