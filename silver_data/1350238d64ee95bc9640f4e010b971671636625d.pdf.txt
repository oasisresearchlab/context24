Upon ultraviolet - B irradiation , UVR8 undergoes an immediate switch from homodimer to monomer , which triggers a signalling pathway for ultraviolet protection . The mechanism by which UVR8 senses ultraviolet - B remains largely unknown . Here we report the crystal structure of UVR8 at 1 . 8A˚ resolution , revealing a symmetric homodimerof seven - bladed b - propeller that is devoid of any external cofactoras the chromophore . Arginineresidues that stabilizethe homodimeric interface , principally Arg 286and Arg 338 , make elaborate intramolecular cation – p interactions with surrounding tryptophan amino acids . Two of these tryptophans , Trp285 and Trp233 , collectively serve as the ultraviolet - B chromophore . Our structural and biochemical analysesidentifythemolecularmechanismforUVR8 - mediatedultraviolet - Bperception , inwhichultraviolet - Bradiation results in destabilization of the intramolecular cation – p interactions , causing disruption of the critical intermolecular hydrogen bonds mediated by Arg 286 and Arg 338 and subsequent dissociation of the UVR8 homodimer . Perception of light is important for all kingdoms of life 1 . Light regulates the circadian clock in worms and social activity in fruitflies 2 , 3 . In plants , light is a major source of energy and regulates all major develop - mental and physiological processes 4 , 5 . A wide wavelength range of light is sensed by specific families of photoreceptors : phytochrome for red and far red 6 ; phototropin and cryptochrome for ultraviolet - A and blue 7 – 11 ; and UVR8 for ultraviolet - B ( wavelength range 280 – 315nm ) 4 , 12 . Except for UVR8 , all other photoreceptors contain specific external cofactors as chromophores : bilin for phytochrome ; FAD and MTHF for cryptochrome ; and FMN for phototropin 4 , 13 . It remains unclear whether UVR8 contains any external cofactor for ultraviolet - B perception . UVR8 , originally identified as a regulatory protein for ultraviolet - B - triggered signal transduction 14 , was recently shown to be a receptor for ultraviolet - B 12 . Ultraviolet - B perception was thought to induce dissociation of the UVR8 homodimer , allowing its subsequent inter - action with COP1 and transcriptional activation of ultraviolet - B - responsive genes 12 , 15 – 17 ( Fig . 1a ) . A number of tryptophan residues , particularly Trp 285 , were shown to have an important role in ultraviolet - B - triggered signalling 12 . Despite these advances , it remains unknown how ultraviolet - B is sensed by UVR8 or how ultraviolet - B perception leads to dissociation of the UVR8 homodimers . Biochemical characterization of UVR8 The full - length , wild - type UVR8 and two variants , W285F and W285A , were purified to homogeneity . As reported 12 , both wild type and W285F existed mainly as homodimers on SDS – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS – PAGE ) in the absence of heating ( Fig . 1b , lanes 1 – 2 ) . However , only wild type , not W285F , was able to undergo ultraviolet - B - induced monomerization ( lanes 7 – 8 ) . By contrast , the variant W285A appeared only as a monomer both before and after ultraviolet - Birradiation ( lanes3and9 ) . Heatingat96 u Cinthepresence ofSDSreducedallUVR8homodimerstoamonomericstate ( lanes4 – 6 ) . These results are in agreement with published observations 12 . The ionic detergent SDS is a protein denaturant . Homodimer formation of wild - type UVR8 , however , is remarkably stable and resists treatment by up to 12 % SDS in the absence of heating ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Because the SDS sample buffer contains 200 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , we speculated that two molecules of UVR8 are held together through a covalent linkage—such as a disulphide bond—that is susceptible to heating in the presence of DTT or ultraviolet - B irradiation . Quite unexpectedly , elevated ionic strength led to efficient conversion of the UVR8 homodimers to a monomeric state ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . This observation strongly suggests that the forces that hold together two UVR8 molecules are ionic in nature . Use of SDS – PAGE may not allow faithful evaluation of native protein conformation . To alleviate this potential problem , we used the more sensitive method of gel filtration to examine the oligomeric state of UVR8 under physiological pH and ionic strength ( Fig . 1c ) . Before ultraviolet - B irradiation , wild - type UVR8 was eluted from gel filtration with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 150 kDa , larger than that calculated for a UVR8 homodimer ( , 100 kDa ) . This discrepancy is probably caused by the extended flexible sequences at the amino and carboxy termini of UVR8 . After ultraviolet - B irra - diation , the elution volume for wild - type UVR8 corresponded to a molecular mass of about 75 kDa ( Fig . 1c ) . This observation confirms the reported , ultraviolet - B - induced dimer - to - monomer switch 12 . As anticipated , the variant UVR8 ( W285F ) appeared as a homodimer irrespective of ultraviolet - B radiation ( Fig . 1c ) . However , unlike the SDS – PAGE result 12 ( Fig . 1b ) , UVR8 ( W285A ) existed mainly as a homodimer both with and without ultraviolet - B treatment ( Fig . 1c ) . Ultraviolet - B irradiation seemed to have weakened formation of the W285A homodimer as judged by the presence of a small fraction of monomers ( Fig . 1c ) . The WD40 repeats of UVR8 are thought to be responsible for ultraviolet - B perception 12 . Supporting this notion , the protease - resistant core domain of UVR8 ( residues 12 – 381 ; Supplementary * Theseauthorscontributedequallytothiswork . 1 Tsinghua - PekingCenterforLifeSciences , CenterforStructuralBiology , SchoolofLifeSciencesandSchoolofMedicine , TsinghuaUniversity , Beijing100084 , China . 2 CollegeofLifeSciences , Peking University , Beijing100871 , China . 3 StateKeyLaboratoryofBio - membraneandMembraneBiotechnology , CenterforStructuralBiology , SchoolofLifeSciencesandSchoolofMedicine , TsinghuaUniversity , Beijing100084 , China . 4 Peking - YaleJointCenterofPlantMolecularGeneticsandAgrobiotechnology , StateKeyLaboratoryofProteinandPlantGeneResearch , PekingUniversity , Beijing100871 , China . 0 0 M O N T H 2 0 1 2 | V O L 0 0 0 | N AT U R E | 1 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

To elucidate the mechanism of ultraviolet - B perception by UVR8 , we crystallized its core domain . Intriguingly , ultraviolet - B irradiation resulted in cracking of these crystals ( Fig . 1d ) , indicating that the UVR8 core domain retained the ability to sense ultraviolet - B in the crystals . We also crystallized the core domain variants W285F and W285A . By contrast , the W285F and W285A crystals failed to crack even after prolonged ultraviolet - B irradiation ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , consistent with loss of ultraviolet - B responsiveness 12 ( Fig . 1c ) . Overall structure of UVR8 The crystal structure of the UVR8 core domain ( residues 12 – 381 ) , which represents 84 % of the full - length UVR8 protein , was deter - mined by selenium - based , single - wavelength anomalous dispersion ( SAD ) . The atomic models of the UVR8 core domain and its variants W285F and W285A were refined at resolutions of 1 . 8 , 2 . 0 and 1 . 8 A ˚ , respectively ( Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . The UVR8 core domain forms a seven - bladed b - propeller ( Fig . 1e ) . In contrast to all previously determined structures of photoreceptor 13 , UVR8 does not contain any external cofactor as the chromophore . Unlike canonical WD - 40 repeats 18 , each blade in UVR8 comprises only three b - strands , termed A , B andC 19 ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . An extended loop , designated loop CD , follows strand C in each blade . By convention 19 , loops AB and CD reside on the bottom face of the b - propeller whereas the BC loop is located on the top face ( Fig . 1e ) . A prominent sequence motif , GWRHT , is present in the AB loops of blades 5 – 7 ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . The seven blades in UVR8 have a nearlyidentical main - chain conformation , which is similar to that of the cell cycle regulatory protein RCC1 ( ref . 20 ; Supplementary Fig . 4b , c ) . In the crystals , two molecules of the UVR8 core domain form a homodimer . Two surface patches of complementary charges are located on the bottom face of each core domain ( Fig . 2a ) . The acidic surface patch comprises five negatively charged amino acids , Glu 43 , Asp 44 and Glu 53 from blade 1 and Asp 96 and Asp 107 from blade 2 . The basic patch contains four positively charged residues , Lys 252 from blade 5 , Arg 286 from blade 6 , and Arg 338 and Arg 354 from blade 7 . The acidic and basic surface patches from one UVR8 core domain associate with the complementarily charged surface patches of another core domain to form a symmetric homodimer ( Fig . 2b and SupplementaryFig . 5 ) . Thishomodimericinterface , involving2 , 566 A˚ 2 buried surface area , is mediated by 32 intermolecular hydrogen bonds . Charged amino acids in the two prominent surface patches contri - bute a total of 20 intermolecular hydrogen bonds at the homodimeric interface ( Fig . 2c ) . In blade 1 of one UVR8 molecule , Glu43 , Asp44 andGlu53acceptfourcharge - stabilizedhydrogenbondsfromArg338 and Arg354 in blade 7 of the other UVR8 molecule . Arg354 also donates a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of residue 52 in blade 1 . In blade 2 , Asp96 and Asp107 mediate four intermolecular hydrogen bonds from Arg286 of blade 6 , whereas Ser106 receives an intermolecular hydrogen bond from Lys252 of blade 5 . In addition to the two prominent surface patches , residues in blade 3 of one UVR8 molecule associate symmetrically with amino acids in blades 4 and 3 from the other UVR8 molecule , contributing 12 additional inter - molecular hydrogen bonds ( Fig . 2c , bottom right ) . All 32 intermolecular hydrogen bonds involve side chains , of which 28 are mediated exclusively by side chains . Apart from two contacts between Gln 148 and Asn 149 ( Fig . 2c , bottom right ) , all 30 other hydrogen bonds rely on charged amino acids and 24 are made between residues of opposite charges . Notably , Arg 286 of blade 4 contributes eight intermolecular hydrogen bonds ( four from each molecule ) at the homodimeric interface . This analysis explains the finding that homodimerization of UVR8is disrupted by elevated ionic strength ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Intramolecular cation – p interactions The overall structures of the UVR8 variants W285F and W285A are nearly identical to that of the core domain , with a pair - wise root - mean - squared deviation of less than 0 . 5 A˚ for all aligned C a atoms ( Fig . 3a , left ) . Analysis of the local structural features surrounding residue 285 reveals no significant conformational changes between the core domain and the variant W285F ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . The aromatic side chain of Phe 285 in W285F occupies the same position , with a similarly planar orientation , as Trp 285 in the core domain . By sharp contrast , major changes occur to three critical residues in the variant W285A ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Compared to wild - type UVR8 , the indole ring of Trp 337 swings approximately 4 A˚ to occupy the vacated space due to replacement of Trp 285 by Ala . Consequently , the indole ring of Trp 233 is rotated 180 u around the C b – C c axis , which in turn drives a 3 . 8 - A˚ movement by the carboxylate group of Asp 129 . Cation – p interactions , known to stabilize protein structure 21 , make considerably more contribution to free energy terms than simple ionic interactions 22 , 23 . Arginine and tryptophan are the most preferred amino acids for cation – p interactions 21 , with strong interactions for the distance range of 3 . 4 – 4 . 5 A ˚ between the cation and the aromatic ring 22 . A detailed analysis of the UVR8 structure revealed an extensive network of intramolecular cation – p interactions surrounding Trp 285 and Arg 286 in blade 6 ( Fig . 3b ) . At the centre of the network , Arg 286 is surrounded by four aromatic amino acids ( Fig . 3b ) . The guanidinium group of Arg 286 is positioned at approximately 3 . 8 and 4 . 2 A ˚ away from the indole d e UV UV - B Heat Before UV - B radiation Molecular weight standard ( kDa ) mAU Dimer Monomer ABloop CD loop BC loop CD loop C N Top face Bottom face Bottomface 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Elution volume ( ml ) UVR8WT UVR8W285F UVR8W285A 60 40 60 40 60 40 158 75 43 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 UVR8 core crystals WT 285F 285A WT 285F 285A WT 285F 285A Dimer Monomer Lane 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 UVR8 UVR8 UVR8 UVR8 COP1 After UV - B radiation 20 0 UV - B UV - B 20 0 UV - B UV - B 20 0 UV - B UV - B 90° 36 Å 50 Å a b c – – – – – – – – – – – – + + + + + + Figure 1 | Characterization and structure of the ultraviolet - sensing protein UVR8 . a , A schematic diagram of ultraviolet - B - induced , UVR8 - mediated signalling cascade .

Arg 286 also interacts with the phenyl ring of Tyr 253 and weakly associates with Trp 250 . In addition , the indole ring of Trp 285 associates with the guanidinium group of Arg 338 through strong cation – p interactions , whereas the indole ring of Trp 285 binds to Trp 233 and Trp 337 through p – p stacking inter - actions 24 ( Fig . 3b ) . The essence of p – p stacking is the cation – p inter - action , as the edge of the tryptophan indole ring ( around the amine group ) carries net positive charges 23 . Furthermore , Trp 233 appears to have an important role in this network by making p – p stacking inter - actions with Trp 337 and strong cation – p interactions with Arg 234 ( Fig . 3b , c ) . It is unusual to have such a high density of cation – p interactions within a protein structure 21 ( Fig . 3c ) . Ultraviolet - B chromophore identification Because UVR8 contains no external cofactor , the chromophore for ultraviolet - Bperceptionmustbeaminoacid ( s ) . Amongthe20naturally occurring amino acids , only tryptophan and tyrosine , with maximal absorption wavelengths of 280 and 275nm , respectively , are potentially capable of perceiving ultraviolet - B ( 280 – 315nm ) . The UVR8 core domain contains thirteen tryptophan and eight tyrosine residues . Six of the thirteen tryptophans are located in the hydrophobic core and away from the homodimeric interface ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) , making them unlikely candidates for ultraviolet - B perception . Among the eight tyrosine residues , only Tyr253 is located close to the homodimeric interface ( Fig . 3b ) . This analysis suggests that the chromophore for ultraviolet - B is among the seven tryptophan residues at the homodi - meric interface . Ultraviolet - B perception is probably coupled with chemical and / or conformational changes around the chromophore , presumably lead - ing to alteration of its fluorescence emission spectra . Mutation of the key chromophore should result in abrogation of its ability to sense ultraviolet - B and consequent loss of fluorescence changes that are characteristic of ultraviolet - B perception . To identify conclusively the chromophore , we individually mutated the seven tryptophan residues to phenylalanine . First , we examined the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra for wild - type UVR8 . In the absence of prior ultraviolet - B treat - ment , wild - type UVR8 was continuously monitored at an emission wavelength of 335nm , with an ultraviolet - B excitation wavelength of 295nm . Consistent with saturable ultraviolet - B perception , the fluor - escence signal increased rapidly over the initial 200s and reached a maximum after 400s ( Fig . 4a , top ) . Prolonged irradiation , however , resulted in a gradual decrease of the fluorescence signal ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 8a ) , presumably due to fluorescence quenching . With prior ultraviolet - B treatment , the fluorescence signal of wild - type UVR8 decreasedveryslowlyover time ( Fig . 4a , top ) , again duetofluorescence quenching . By sharp contrast , the UVR8 variants W285F and W285A completely lost the ability to perceive ultraviolet - B ( Fig . 4a , bottom ; Supplementary Fig . 8b ) . These observations identify Trp 285 as an essential component of the chromophore . Next , we examined the other six UVR8 missense proteins . Most notably , the variant W233F no longer showed an increase in fluor - escence induced by ultraviolet - B ( Fig . 4b , left ) , suggesting that Trp 233 also has an essential role in ultraviolet - B perception . By sharp contrast , each of the five variants W337F , W302F , W250F , W198F and W94F retained the ability to sense ultraviolet - B and to undergo ultraviolet - B - induced dimer - to - monomer switches ( Fig . 4b and Sup - plementary Fig . 8c ; W94F , datanotshown ) . Theseanalysesunambigu - ously identify Trp 285and Trp 233collectively as the chromophore for ultraviolet - B perception . Consistent with this conclusion , Trp285 and Trp 233 are involved in considerably more and stronger cation – p 1 2 3 4 5 Arg 354 Glu 53 Arg 338 Asp 44 Arg 200 Glu 158 Glu 182 Asn 149 Gln 148 Arg 146 Gln 148 Asn 149 157 O Asp 107 Arg 286 Asp 96 Lys 252 Ser106 Glu 43 52 O 6 7 Bottom face N C c 90° 90° a b 90° 7 1 Blade 1 Blade 2 2 6 5 4 3 Blade 3 Figure 2 | Structural basis of UVR8 homodimer formation . a , The bottom face of the UVR8 propeller contains two surface patches of complementary charges .

All rights reserved ©2012 interactions compared to other tryptophans such as Trp 337 and Trp 198 ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Ultraviolet - B perception by Trp 285 and Trp 233 probably results in disruption of the cation – p interactions with key arginine residues , causing disruption of arginine - mediated intermolecular hydrogen bonds and consequent dissociation of UVR8 homodimers . To identify the key arginine residues , we generated five UVR8 variants , each targeting an arginine at the UVR8 homodimeric interface . Compared to wild - type UVR8 , the variants R286A and R338A exhib - ited a grossly altered ability to perceive ultraviolet - B ( Supplementary Fig . 10 , left ) . Notably , these two UVR8 variants existed exclusively in a monomeric state ( Supplementary Fig . 10 , right ) , consistent with the important role of Arg 286 and Arg 338 at the homodimeric interface . By contrast , the variants R354A , R200A and R146A retained the abilities to perceive ultraviolet - B and to undergo an ultraviolet - B - induced dimer - to - monomer switch ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . Transient nature of monomeric UVR8 Absorption of ultraviolet - B is predicted to excite the indole rings of the chromophore Trp285 and Trp233 . Because the excited indole rings may dissipate energy to return to their ground state , we suspected that the ultraviolet - B - irradiated UVR8 monomers may revert back to homodimers over time . To examine this prediction , we subjected the UVR8 core domain to a saturating amount of ultraviolet - B radiation , lefttheproteinatroomtemperature ( 23 u C ) torecover inthe absenceof ultraviolet - B , and applied aliquots of the protein to SDS – PAGE at various time points . The result clearly shows that the UVR8 monomer slowly but steadily converted back to the homodimeric state ( Fig . 4c ) . The partially recovered UVR8 homodimers can be completely mono - merizedagainbyultraviolet - Birradiation ( Fig . 4c , lane8 ) . Thetransient nature of monomeric UVR8 has obstructed repeated crystallization efforts , which were designed to capture the conformation of the ultra - violet - B - activated UVR8 core domain . The crystals were eventually obtained but only contained the homodimeric form ( Fig . 4d ) . Obviously , ultraviolet - B - irradiated UVR8 core domain in the crystal - lization drops slowly reverted to a dimeric state before crystallization . Nonetheless , we solved this structure , which is identical to that of the UVR8 core domain before ultraviolet - B irradiation . Perspective Photoreceptors rely on chromophores to perceive light . For example , phytochrome covalently associates with a single bilin molecule 25 , 26 , cryptochrome contains a non - covalently - bound FAD molecule 27 , 28 , and phototropin depends on FMN 29 , 30 . In contrast to all known photo - receptors , UVR8 does not contain any external cofactor and instead uses two tryptophan residues , Trp 285 and Trp233 , as the chromo - phore for ultraviolet - B perception . This seems natural , because the absorption wavelengths for tryptophan coincide with the range of ultraviolet - B . Consequently , the ultraviolet - B - sensing mechanism of UVR8 differs markedly from those of other photoreceptors . Our experimental evidence , in conjunction with knowledge of tryptophan fluorescence , yields a mechanistic model of ultraviolet - B perception by UVR8 ( Fig . 4e ) . Ultraviolet - B irradiation results in excitation of the Trp 285 and Trp 233 indole rings , which is thought to disrupt the P - bond over the indole rings , leading to destabilization and abrogation of the intramolecular cation – p interactions . Such disruption is likely to trigger conformational switch of the side chains of Arg 286 and Arg 338 , which would no longer be able to maintain intermolecular hydrogen bonds with Asp or Glu residues from the neighbouring UVR8 molecule , causing dissociation of the UVR8 homodimer ( Fig . 4e ) . Furthermore , the excited indole rings are known to undergo a process of excited - state proton transfer 31 , which allows the indole ring to carry a positive charge and completely destroys the cation – p interactions . Importantly , excited - state proton transfer also leads to quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence , providing a plausible explanation for the observed slow decrease of Core W302 R338 R286 W285 W233 R234 D129 W337 A24 W285 W337 W233 D129 F285 W337 W233 D129 A285 W337 W233 D129 W302 R338 Y253 K252 R286 W233 W285 W337 W250 R234 a b c Core – W285F Core – W285A 6 . 3 Å 3 . 8 Å 4 Å D77 Core W285F W285A Positive Negative R338 W337 W302 W285 W233 R234 K252 R286 W250 Y253 Figure 3 | Structural features of the ultraviolet - B - sensing amino acids . a , Structural comparison of UVR8 core domain ( coloured green ) with the variants W285F ( red ) and W285A ( blue ) .

Notably , Asp 129 , Glu 182 and Arg 234 are all located in close proximity to Trp 233 and Trp 285 ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) and may well serve as proton donors . In this model , ultra - violet - B perception involves no covalent modification of UVR8 , such as tryptophan oxidation or crosslinking . This notion is supported by mass spectrometric analysis ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . Further sup - porting this conclusion , ultraviolet - B - induced monomerization of UVR8 was unaffected by the presence of strong reducing or oxidizing agents ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . The observed fluorescence emission represents the total input from all 13 tryptophan residues and potentially other aromatic amino acids inUVR8 . However , onlythoseresiduesthatareaffectedbyultraviolet - B perception or ultraviolet - B - induced environmental changes contribute to alteration of the fluorescence signal . The fact that a missense muta - tion of either Trp285 or Trp233 completely abrogates increase of the fluorescence signal identifies these two amino acids collectively as the chromophore for ultraviolet - B .

This analysis alsovalidatesthemeasurementofintrinsictryptophanfluorescenceasasensitivemethodforthedetectionofultraviolet - B perception . Our study serves as a framework for understanding mutant pheno - types in plants . For example , the Arabidopsis mutants G145S and G202R lost the ability to perceive ultraviolet - B and the mutant proteins G145S and G202R were no longer able to form a homodimer 12 . In our crystal structure , Arg146 and Arg200 make an important contribution to stabilize formation of the UVR8 homodimer ( Fig . 2c ) ; both Gly145 and Gly202 are located in close proximity to Arg146 and Arg200 , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . Thus the mutations G145S and G202R may have a deleterious consequence on homodimer formation . Despiterevealingthestructurerevelationandunderlyingmechanism , important questions remain about the UVR8 - mediated signalling pathway . It is unclear how UVR8 interacts with the central regulator of light signalling , COP1 . How the UVR8 – COP1 complex regulates downstream signalling events is uncertain . Answers to these questions await further experimental investigations . While this manuscript was under final revision at Nature , Christie et al . reported similar findings in Science 32 . METHODS SUMMARY Wild - type UVR8 and all variants were subcloned by standard molecular biology , expressed , and purified . Tryptophan fluorescence was measured in a fluorescence spectrophotometer ( HITACHIF - 4600 ) , withexcitationandemissionwavelengths of 295 and 335nm , respectively . Gel filtration was used to observe ultraviolet - B - induced conformationalchanges . Allcrystalswere generatedbythe hanging - drop vapour - diffusionmethod . AlldatasetswerecollectedattheShanghaiSynchrotron Radiation Facility ( SSRF ) beamline BL17U and the SPring - 8 beamline BL41XU and processed using the HKL2000 package 33 . Further processing was carried out using programs from the CCP4 suite 34 . The UVR8 structure was solved using the SeMet - derived UVR8 ( W285A ) crystals . The selenium positions were determined usingtheprogram SHELXD 35 . A partial modelwastraced automaticallyusingthe program BUCCANEER 36 . The resulting map was in good quality and the partial model was manually rebuilt in COOT 37 . Sequence assignment was aided with the selenium sites in the anomalous difference Fourier map . The final structure was refined with PHENIX 38 . Using UVR8 ( W285A ) coordinates as the initial search model , crystalstructuresofW285Fandwild - typeUVR8weresolvedbymolecular replacement using PHASER 39 and refined with COOT 37 and PHENIX 38 .

All constructs of A . thaliana UVR8 ( full - length , residues 1 – 440 ) were cloned into pET - 29b ( Novagen ) with a hexahistidine ( 6 3 His ) tag at the C terminus . The plasmids were then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) andoverexpressedbyinductionwith0 . 2mM b - D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) at 18 u Covernight . Thebacteriawere harvestedbycentrifugationandresus - pended in 150mM NaCl , 25mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , and lysed by sonication . After centrifugation , the supernatant was loaded into Ni 2 1 - NTA affinity columns ( Qiagen ) , and washed with 150mM NaCl , 25mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) . The target protein waselutedby250mMimidazole ( pH8 . 0 ) , 25mMTris ( pH8 . 0 ) andfurtherpurified by a Source - 15Q column ( GE Healthcare ) . The protein was then concentrated , and purifiedbygelfiltration ( Superdex - 200 , 10 / 30 , GEHealthcare ) withabuffercontain - ing150mMNaCl , 25mMTris ( pH8 . 0 ) and5mMDTT . Theproteinswerereadyfor biochemical assay . The core domain of UVR8 ( residues 12 – 381 ) was purified by gel filtration with the same protocol described above and concentrated to about 4mg ml 2 1 for crystallization . Ultraviolet - Bradiation . Theproteinwasexposedtoultraviolet - Bradiationfrom an ultraviolet - B lamp ( 11W , l max 5 308nm ) , at a distance of 20cm , for 30min on ice before biochemical assay or crystallization . Tryptophan fluorescence measurements . The protein was adjusted to about 1 m M in the buffer containing 150mM NaCl , 25mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 5mM DTT . Tryptophanfluorescencewasmeasuredinafluorescencespectrophotometer ( HITACHI F - 4600 ) . The excitation and emission wavelengths were 295 and 335nm , respectively . Gelfiltration . Superdex - 200 ( 10 / 30 , GEHealthcare ) wasusedtoobserveultraviolet - B - induced conformational changes . The column was pre - equilibrated with 150mM NaCl , 25mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 5mM DTT , and calibrated with molecular weight standards ( GE Healthcare ) . The protein with or without ultraviolet - B irradiation was injected into the column , and eluted with a flow rate of 0 . 4mlmin 2 1 . Mass spectrometry . The untreated and ultraviolet - irradiated wild - type , full - length UVR8 samples were mixed with 0 . 5 m l of 10mgml 2 1 a - cyano - 4 - hydroxysuccinnamic acid in 50 % acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) TFA , and applied onto a MALDI plate . MALDI mass spectra were recorded with a MALDI _ TOF / TOF massspectrometeroperatedinthelinearmode . Bovineserumalbumin ( BSA ) was used as the internal standard . The mass difference for the whole protein before and after ultraviolet - B treatment is less than 1Da , indicating the there is no mass change upon ultraviolet - B irradiation . For detection of potential protein oxidation , the untreated and ultraviolet - irradiated UVR8 samples were separated on SDS – PAGE , excised , and in - gel digested with trypsin at 37 u C overnight . The peptides were extracted twice with 1 % TFA in 50 % acetonitrile for 30min , and applied to LC - MS / MS analysis in the LTQ - Orbitrap mass spectrometer . The MS / MS spectra from each run were searched for possible tryptophan hydroxylation and formation of N - formyl - kyneurine . No apparent oxidation was detected for any tryptic frag - ment . This result suggests that ultraviolet radiation does not induce noticeable tryptophan oxidation . Crystallization . SeMet - derived UVR8 ( W285A ) crystals were grown at 18 u C using the hanging - drop vapour - diffusion method by mixing 1 . 2 m l of SeMet - derived UVR8 ( W285A ) protein with 1 . 2 m l of reservoir solution contain 23 % ( w / v ) PEG3350 , 100mMBis - Trisbuffer ( pH6 . 0 ) and0 . 2 m l30 % ( w / v ) 1 , 5 - diaminopentane dihydrochloride . Wild - typeUVR8crystalswereobtainedbymixing1 . 5 m lofprotein withanequal volume of reservoir solutioncontaining 18 % ( w / v ) PEG8000 , 100mM Tris buffer ( pH 9 . 2 ) and 200mM magnesium chloride . The UVR8 variant W285F was crystallized similarly using a reservoir solution containing 17 % ( w / v ) PEG8000 , 100mMTris buffer ( pH 8 . 5 ) and200mMmagnesium chloride . Allnative andSe - Met crystals were directly flash - frozen in a cold nitrogen stream at 100K . Data collection and structural determination . The data sets for UVR8 ( W285F ) and SeMet - derived UVR8 ( W285A ) were collected at the SSRF beamline BL17U , thewild - typeUVR8datawerecollectedattheSPring - 8beamlineBL41XU . Alldata sets were integrated and scaled using the HKL2000 package 33 . Further processing wascarriedoutusingprogramsfromtheCCP4suite 34 . Datacollectionstatisticsare summarized in Supplementary Table 1 . The UVR8 structure was solved using the SeMet - derived UVR8 ( W285A ) crystals in the I 222 space group . The selenium positions were determined using the program SHELXD 35 . The identified selenium positions were refined and initial phases were calculated using the PHASER SAD experimental phasing module 39 . Solvent flattening and histogram matching were applied to the electron density map in DM 34 . A crude partial model was traced automatically using the program BUCCANEER 36 , then the model was fed back to the program PHASER tocombine SAD phasing and partial structure information . TheresultingmapwasingoodqualityandthepartialmodelwasmanuallyrebuiltinCOOT 37 . Sequenceassignment was aidedwith the selenium sites inthe anomalous difference Fourier map . The final structure was refined with PHENIX 38 . Using UVR8 ( W285A ) coordinates as an initial model , crystal structures of W285F and wild - type UVR8 were solved by molecular replacement using PHASER 39 and manually refined with COOT 37 and PHENIX 38 .
