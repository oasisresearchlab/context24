The PPFIA1 gene for liprin - a 1 is frequently ampliﬁed in human breast cancers . We recently demonstrated that liprin - a 1 is an important regulator of cell edge dynamics during motility . We show , herein , that the liprin - a 1 protein is highly expressed in human breast tumors . Functional analysis shows that liprin - a 1 is speci - ﬁcally required for the migration and invasion of highly invasive human breast cancer MDA - MB - 231 cells . We used time - lapse analysis to demonstrate defects in the motility of liprin - a 1 - depleted cells that include a striking instability of the lamellipodia . Liprin - a 1 levels altered by either RNA interference or overexpression affected also cell spreading and the number of invadopodia per cell , but not the density of invadopodia per unit of surface area . On the other hand , silencing of liprin - a 1 inhibited the degradation of the ECM , whereas its overexpression enhanced degradation , resulting in signiﬁcant negative or positive effects , respectively , on the area of degradation per invadopodium . Transfection of ﬂuorescent - labeled cortactin revealed that depletion of liprin - a 1 also affected the assembly and disassembly of invadopodia , with decrease of their lifetime . Our results strongly support a novel important role of liprin - a 1 in the regulation of human tumor cell invasion .

As all other members of the family , the widely expressed liprin - a 1 / PPFIA1 protein is made by an amino - terminal coiled - coil region and a carboxy - term - inal region including three predicted steryl alpha motifs , which are present in several proteins to mediate interactions with either proteins , RNA or lipid membranes ( Qiao and Bowie , 2005 ) . Liprins show some degree of homology with kazrinE , a widely expressed cytoplasmic protein with three carboxy - terminal steryl alpha motifs that is involved in epidermal differentiation ( Nachat et al . , 2009 ) . Liprin - a proteins may interact with different ligands , including liprin - b , the tyrosine phosphatase receptor LAR , kinesin motor proteins , the ArfGAP GIT1 and the adaptor proteins ERC and CASK ( see de Curtis , 2011 for a review ) . Liprin - a 1 is required for the assembly of neuronal synapses ( Span - gler and Hoogenraad , 2007 ) and is implicated in the regulation of non - neuronal cell migration ( Shen et al . , 2007 ) . We have recently shown that liprin - a 1 is an essential regulator of cell spreading on extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ( Asperti et al . , 2009 , 2010 ) . Interestingly , the gene for liprin - a 1 is included in the human chromosomal region 11q13 ( Katoh and Katoh , 2005 ; Ja¨rvinen et al . , 2006 ) that is frequently ampliﬁed in various malignant tumors , including B 20 % of breast cancers ( Al - Kuraya et al . , 2004 ) . Based on this information , we have addressed the role of liprin - a 1 in the regulation of the different cellular processes required for the invasion of the MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells . Results and discussion Liprin - a 1 is required for tumor cell invasion Ampliﬁcation of the PPFIA1 / liprin - a 1 gene has been reported in various cancers including B 20 % of breast cancers . Whether this ampliﬁcation reﬂects an increase in the liprin - a 1 protein is not known . By using afﬁnity - puriﬁed antibodies , we found that liprin - a 1 is highly expressed in breast cancer ( Figure 1a ) . In support of a possible role of liprin - a 1 in breast cancer , we found that 57 of 116 human breast cancer samples examined by immunohistochemistry show a clear increase in the expression of the endogenous protein in tumor cells ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . Given the published effects of liprin - a 1 on cell motility , we used RNA interference to study the function of this protein in the motility of human MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells , an established system Received 18 May 2010 ; revised 1 November 2010 ; accepted 8 November 2010 ; published online 13 December 2010 Correspondence : Professor I de Curtis , Cell Adhesion Unit , Division of Neurosciences , San Raffaele Scientiﬁc Institute and University Vita - Salute San Raffaele , Via Olgettina 58 , Milano 20132 , Italy .

Liprin - a 1 was efﬁciently depleted ( 89 – 98 % silencing ) in MDA - MB - 231 cells by either of two different small interfering RNAs ( Figure 1b ) . Liprin - a 1 depletion had no effect on cell adhesion to ﬁbronectin ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) , but it was required for migration ( Figure 1c ) . MDA - MB - 231 cells are highly invasive in response to speciﬁc stimuli ( Supple - mentary Figure S3 ) , and liprin - a 1 depletion strongly inhibited also invasion of these cells through Matrigel ( BD Transduction ) ( Figure 1d ) . Conversely , depletion of components of the PIX / GIT complexes that may interact with liprin - a 1 ( Totaro et al . , 2007 ) did affect Figure 1 Liprin - a 1 is required for human breast cancer cell invasion . ( a ) Expression of liprin - a in human tumors , detected with afﬁnity - puriﬁed anti - liprin - a 1 antibodies . Sections from parafﬁn - embedded tissues were incubated for 1h with 0 . 25 m g / ml afﬁnity - puriﬁed anti - liprin - a 1 immunoglobulin G and peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies , and counterstained with hematoxylin . Bars ¼ 100 m m . ( b ) Downregulation of endogenous proteins in MDA - MB - 231 cells transfected with small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) . Bars are percentages ± s . e . m . of protein after silencing ( n ¼ 2 (cid:2) 4 experiments ) . MDA - MB - 231 cells from ATCC ( American type culture collection , Manassas , VA , USA ) were used up to the tenth passage . Antibodies for liprin - a 1 and b PIX have been characterized ( Asperti et al . , 2009 ) . We utilized monoclonal antibodies against Flag and tubulin ( Sigma - Aldrich , St Louis , MO , USA ) , GIT1 / 2 ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA ) and cortactin ( Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) ; polyclonal antibodies against Flag ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , GIT1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) and GFP ( green ﬂuorescent protein ) ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA ) . siRNAs ( from Invitrogen , Paisley , Scotland , UK or Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) for human liprin - a 1 ( liprins1a and b ) , human GIT2 , human b PIX and control ( luciferase ) were as described ( Frank et al . , 2006 ; Asperti et al . , 2009 ) . The siRNA for human GIT1 targeted the sequence 5 0 - GCCTGGATGGAGACCTAGA - 3 0 . Cells transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) and 50 – 100n M of siRNAs were used after 2 days for immunoblotting ( Asperti et al . , 2009 ) . ( c , d ) MDA - MB - 231 siRNA - transfected cells were tested for migration ( c ) and invasion ( d ) . For migration , siRNA - transfected serum - starved cells ( 30000 / well ) were seeded in 8 m m 24 Transwells ( Corning Inc . Life Sciences , Lowell , MA , USA ) with lower chamber coated with 20 m g / ml ﬁbronectin and analyzed after 8h . For invasion , cells ( 100000 / well ) were seeded on Matrigel ( BD Transduction , San Jose , CA , USA ) - coated Transwells with lower chambers ﬁlled with NIH 3T3 - conditioned medium ( Shaw , 2005 ) . After 5h , cells invading to the lower side were counted ( n X 4 experiments , in duplicate ) . All quantitative analyses presented in this and the following ﬁgures were blinded . Bars are normalized means ± s . e . m . ( migration assays : 4 – 6 experiments ; 2 experiments with b Pix siRNAs . Invasion assays : 4 – 5 experiments ; 2 experiments with liprin1b siRNA ) . Signiﬁcance was set at P o 0 . 05 by the Student’s t - test ( * o 0 . 05 ; * * o 0 . 01 ) . Regulation of tumor cell invasion by liprin - a 1 V Astro et al 1842 Oncogene neither migration nor invasion ( Figures 1c and d ) . These data demonstrate a unique role of liprin - a 1 in breast cancer cell invasion . The LAR tyrosine phosphate receptor is another binding partner of liprin - a 1 ( Serra - Page ` s et al . , 1995 ) . LAR is expressed in MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Figure 2a ) . We found that LAR depletion by small interfering RNA inhibited MDA - MB - 231 cell spreading on ﬁbronectin ( Figures 2b and c ) . Moreover , the steryl alpha motif2 domain required for the interaction of liprin - a 1 with Figure 2 For caption please see page 1844 . Regulation of tumor cell invasion by liprin - a 1 V Astro et al 1843 Oncogene LAR was required for the positive effects of liprin - a 1 on cell spreading ( Figures 2e and f ) and on the redistribution of active b 1 - integrins ( Figures 2g – i ) , thus conﬁrming the effects of these proteins described in non - tumorigenic COS7 cells ( Asperti et al . , 2009 ) . On the other hand , LAR depletion had no detectable effects on invasion by MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Figure 2d ) . Therefore , the effects of liprin - a 1 on tumor cell invasion appear to be independent from LAR . Liprin - a 1 regulates cell edge dynamics and the motility of tumor cells We investigated the possible causes of the observed inhibition of MDA - MB - 231 cell migration and invasion by time - lapse analysis during random migration ( Pankov et al . , 2005 ) . Liprin - a 1 silencing had a striking effect on the behavior of cells freely moving on ﬁbronectin ( Figure 3a ) , with a signiﬁcant decrease of both the path ( (cid:2) 17 % ) and Euclidean distance ( (cid:2) 38 % ) covered by the liprin - a 1 - depleted cells , and a non - signiﬁcant decrease in spontaneous directionality ( (cid:2) 24 % ) , suggesting a defect in the persistence of directed movement ( Figures 3b and c ) . Interestingly , time - lapse analysis highlighted a dramatic effect of liprin - a 1 silencing on lamellipodia , the lamellar protrusions driving locomotion of cells on ECM ( Supplementary movies S1 and S2 ) . Quantiﬁcation revealed in liprin - a 1 - depleted cells a twofold increase in the number of lamellipodia per cell and a 60 % decrease in the average life of lamellipodia ( Figure 3d ) . These data show that liprin - a 1 is important for the stabilization of lamellipodial protrusions , and suggest that the defect in lamellipodial persistence may underlie the defect in migration and invasion observed in MDA - MB - 231 tumor cells depleted of liprin - a 1 . We also tested the effects of liprin - a 1 in other human tumor cell lines that include cervical cancer HeLa cells , poorly invasive breast cancer MCF7 cells , ﬁbrosarcoma HT1080 cells and epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells . All these cells express liprin - a 1 , but only invasion by HeLa cells was inhibited by the depletion of endogenous liprin - a 1 ( Supplementary Figures S4a – b ) , whereas for MCF7 , invasion was very poor under the experimental setting utilized ( data not shown ) . We then compared the effects of liprin - a 1 depletion on the motile behavior of HeLa and HT1080 cells on ﬁbronectin ( Supplementary Figure S4c ) . As for MDA - MB - 231 cells , liprin - a 1 depletion inhibited both the path and the path rate ( Vp ) of HeLa cells , whereas it had an opposite effect in HT1080 cells , where liprin - a 1 depletion resulted in an increase of both parameters ( Supplementary Figure S4d ) . On the other hand , overexpression of liprin - a 1 did not signiﬁcantly affect the behavior of either cell types ( Supplementary Figure S4e ) . As observed in MDA - MB - 231 cells , liprin - a 1 depletion in HeLa cells caused also an increase in the number of lamellipodia per cell and a decrease in the average life of the lamellipodia ( Supplementary Figure S4f ) . Interest - ingly , depletion of liprin - a 1 caused similar effects on the number and persistence of lamellipodia even in the poorly invasive MCF7 breast cancer cells , although these cells were almost non - motile on ﬁbronectin ( Supplementary Figure S4f ) . Altogether , these results indicate that different types of human tumor cells respond differently to liprin - a 1 depletion and suggest that liprin - a 1 is important for the invasion of different types of tumor cells . Liprin - a 1 is required for efﬁcient ECM degradation Invadopodia are dynamic ﬁlamentous actin - rich protru - sions effecting ECM degradation and tumor cell invasion ( Weaver , 2008 ; Albiges - Rizo et al . , 2009 ) . We investigated whether liprin - a 1 inﬂuences the formation and / or function of invadopodia . Endogenous liprin - a 1 did not colocalize with cortactin - positive , ﬁlamentous actin - positive invadopodia ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . We quantiﬁed the number of both centrally located ( perinuclear ) and total invadopodia per cell . Liprin - a 1 silencing decreased the number of invadopodia per cell , whereas liprin - a 1 overexpression increased the number of invadopodia per cell ( Figures 4a and b ) . On the other hand , no signiﬁcant differences in the density of invadopodia were observed in cells with altered liprin - a 1 levels when compared with controls ( Figure 4c ) . These results suggest that the effects of liprin - a 1 on the Figure 2 LAR is required for spreading , but not for invasion .

The 9EG7mAb and the anti - LAR mAb recognizing the 150kDa E subunit were from BD Biosciences . The siRNA for LAR and the plasmid for FLAG - liprin - D SAM2 have been described previously ( Asperti et al . , 2009 ) . Regulation of tumor cell invasion by liprin - a 1 V Astro et al 1844 Oncogene number of invadopodia per cell may simply reﬂect the inhibitory or promoting effect on spreading induced by liprin - a 1 silencing or overexpression , respectively ( Figure 4d ) . We then tested whether liprin - a 1 inﬂuences the function of invadopodia by assessing ECM degradation . Active invadopodia can be found both in the perinuclear region and at the periphery of cells ( Supplementary Figure S6 ) . Liprin - a 1 silencing evidently inhibited ECM degradation , both as percentage of cells showing matrix degradation ( 48 % after liprin - a 1 silencing versus 90 % in control cells ) and as the fraction of cell area overlapping with matrix degradation , which was reduced by 7 . 7 - fold ( Figure 5a ) .

Regulation of tumor cell invasion by liprin - a 1 V Astro et al 1846 Oncogene Figure 5 For caption please see page 1848 . Regulation of tumor cell invasion by liprin - a 1 V Astro et al 1847 Oncogene for the reduction in spreading induced by liprin - a 1 silencing ( Figure 5a ) , the fraction of basal cell area associated with ECM degradation was still reduced by fourfold , and the area of ECM degradation per invadopodium was reduced by 4 . 5 - fold . On the other hand , liprin - a 1 - overexpressing cells showed a 2 . 6 - fold increase of ECM degradation ( Figure 5b ) . Normal - ization for the increase in projected cell area induced by liprin - a 1 overexpression revealed a twofold increase in the average fraction of cell area associated with ECM degradation in liprin - a 1 - transfected cells , whereas the area of ECM degradation per invadopodium was increased by 1 . 6 - fold . The effects of liprin - a 1 levels on ECM degradation suggest a role of this protein in the regulation of invadopodia function . Liprin - a 1 inﬂuences the dynamics of invadopodia Time - lapse imaging on cells cotransfected with DS - Red - Cortactin and liprin - a 1 small interfering RNA ( Supple - mentary movies S3 and S4 ) revealed a signiﬁcant decrease ( 30 % ) of the average lifespan of invadopodia compared with controls ( Figures 5c and d ) . Both the rates of assembly and disassembly of invadopodia were markedly higher in liprin - a 1 - depleted cells ( Figure 5d ) . Altogether , these ﬁndings indicate a higher turnover of invadopodia upon liprin - a 1 depletion and suggest a role of this protein in the stabilization of invadopodia . The higher turnover of invadopodia may underlie the inhibitory effects of liprin - a 1 silencing on matrix degradation ( Figure 5 ) and invasion ( Figure 1 ) . Conclusions Our data show that liprin - a 1 is required for breast and cervical cancer cell invasion , and suggest that this protein is highly expressed in human breast cancer . We have shown that the inhibitory effects of the depletion of endogenous liprin - a 1 on the motility of highly invasive breast cancer cells correlates with alterations in the turnover of both lamellipodia and invadopodia , two cellular structures important for invasion . Similar effects were also observed on the motile properties of cervical cancer HeLa cells . The effects of liprin - a 1 depletion on the stability of lamellipodia and invadopodia support the hypothesis of a role of liprin - a 1 in the regulation of dynamic events associated with invasion . In apparent contrast with our conclusion , liprin - a 1 depletion increases invasion of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells ( Tan et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , a correlation between liprin - a 1 expression and invasive - ness cannot be general for tumors . On the other hand , it is reasonable to postulate that the positive effects of liprin - a 1 in the invasion of MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells may depend on speciﬁc liprin - related signaling networks available in these cells . We therefore would like to propose the hypothesis that the combina - tion of liprin - a 1 expression with speciﬁc sets of signaling molecules may result in the promotion of invasion by liprin - a 1 in certain tumor cells , whereas different combinations may explain the observed lack of positive effects or even opposite effects of liprin - a 1 in other tumor cell types . In this direction , the tumor suppressor ING4 may interact with liprin - a 1 , thus suppressing migration of colon carcinoma cells ( Kim et al . , 2004 ) . Conversely , whereas ING4 gene deletion has been associated with the invasiveness of 10 – 20 % of human breast cancer cell lines and tumors , no such deletion was detected in invasive MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Kim et al . , 2004 ) . Moreover , we have shown , herein , that other liprin - a 1 - interacting partners , those of the GIT / PIX complexes and LAR phosphatase receptors do not appear to be involved in the invasion of MDA - MB - 231 cells . Future work is needed to identify the partner ( s ) mediating the effects of liprin - a 1 on breast cancer cell invasion . Our study strongly supports a role for liprin - a 1 in tumor progression through its ability of regulating invasion , and provides the basis for further functional validation that may lead to the identiﬁcation of novel candidates for prognosis and targeted therapies .

MDA - MB - 231 cells transfected for 2 days with small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) ( a ) or 1 day with plasmids for Flag - liprin - a 1 ( b ) were replated for 5h ( 50000 cells per coverslip ) on Oregon - green 488 - conjugated gelatin ( Invitrogen ) and 10 m g / ml ﬁbronectin ( Artym et al . , 2006 ) . An Olympus IX70 microscope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) was used to measure degradation , projected cell areas and number of cortactin - , ﬁlamentous actin - positive invadopodia ( 60 cells per condition , three experiments ) .
