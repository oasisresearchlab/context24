However , less is understood about the mechanisms by which particular as - pects of a community may drive perceptions of social norms in the community . Using anti - vaccine conspiracies as a testbed , this paper experimentally examines three such features and their relation - ships : prevalence of conspiratorial content , community response , and explicit community rules . Results show that prevalence of con - tent has a significant effect on norm perceptions , while the results did not support the effects of explicit rule on norm perceptions . However , these effects can be mitigated by the way a community responds to such content . Furthermore , perceived norms also in - fluence other expectations about the community , from escalated behaviors to belief in other conspiracy theories . The paper con - cludes by highlighting the implications of these findings for online platform design , for community governance , and for future research about the relationships among conspiratorial content and norm perceptions .

The spread of such content has extensive impacts on people’s lives and on society at large — from misleading people about medical and health information [ 15 , 47 , 125 ] , to giving inaccurate impressions about popular opinions [ 69 , 89 , 104 ] , to escalating disagreements in ways that negatively influence social interactions and relationships [ e . g . , 134 , 135 ] , to damaging trust in science and authorities [ e . g . , 24 , 105 ] . In several cases , conspiracy beliefs on social media have transferred to offline , often escalated , interactions [ e . g . , 3 , 95 , 95 , 106 , 132 ] . For example , online conspiracy theories about COVID - 19 vaccination have made vaccine coverage more challenging around the world [ 95 , 132 ] and have inspired different incidents of violent attacks in offline interactions [ e . g . , 3 , 106 ] . Numerous approaches have been developed and investigated to address conspiratorial theories and related misinformation [ e . g . , 1 , 4 , 5 , 20 , 68 , 115 , 128 ] . Examples include employing human and automatic fact - checkers [ 4 , 5 ] , reducing the visibility of misleading content [ 25 , 128 ] , or designing interventions to improve individuals’ media related literacy skills [ 17 , 60 , 115 , 133 ] . However , most of these approaches are primarily technical and predominantly focused on the individual pieces of content [ 7 ] . This individualistic focus downplays the role that online communities have on the way people make sense of different issues . For exam - ple , beliefs in conspiracy theories are rarely the result of a lack of knowledge about a certain topic , but are more influenced by the ways online communities respond to such topics [ 41 , 73 , 102 ] . The way a community responds to conspiratorial content ( e . g . , sharing , liking , commenting ) can significantly shape the influence that such content has [ 19 , 37 , 52 , 56 , 57 , 124 , 130 ] . This influence can occur both for individuals and at the broader community level . At the individual level , prior work has shown how the activities of community members contribute to the ex - posure of other members to conspiratorial content [ 12 ] , thereby influencing their opinions about and their responses to such con - tent [ 37 , 53 ] . However , less work has investigated the community level effects of members’ responses to such content , such as per - ceived norms around conspiratorial content , increasing political polarization [ 79 ] , or mistrust in science and authorities [ 22 ] . In particular , the response of community members to an event influ - ences perceptions about what people in the community do , what they approve of , and how they expect other members to behave with respect to a certain event . Such perceptions are referred to as perceived norms [ 110 , 111 ] . Perceived norms in turn influence CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Zhila Aghajari , Eric P . S . Baumer , and Dominic DiFranzo people’s behaviors [ 81 , 111 , 129 ] . Indeed , prior work demonstrates the influence of perceived norms on people’s behaviors in a variety of domains , from drinking habits [ 129 ] , to decision making about the disclosure of personal information online [ 81 ] , to individual language use [ 9 ] . Recent work has specifically acknowledged the role of perceived norms on the way people respond to misleading and conspiratorial content [ 37 , 70 ] . As acknowledged by prior work [ e . g . , 50 , 82 , 114 ] , perceived norms are important not only by influencing individual behav - iors but also through their broad impacts . Examples include the ways perceived norms contribute to social tolerance of certain ac - tions [ e . g . , 50 , 97 ] , escalated behaviors [ e . g . , 82 ] , and impressions about popularity of ( dis ) trust in science [ 38 , 61 , 114 ] , among oth - ers . Each of these impacts can have important consequences . For instance , perceptions of social tolerance impact not only the way people respond to individual actions , but also the impressions that people take about a community’s opinions as a whole around dif - ferent topics [ e . g . , homosexual marriage 97 , 138 ] , [ e . g . , mandatory vaccination 50 ] . In addition , perceived norms can impact expecta - tions around escalated behaviors , where people form exaggerated perceptions about a community’s norms and consider escalated behaviors as normative as well [ 82 , 123 ] . These perceptions in turn can influence expectations about how a community responds to such attitudes . Thus , it is important to investigate the ways by which perceived norms are formed and to explore strategies to design around them . However , relatively less is known about the mechanisms by which norms around conspiracy theories and related misinforma - tion are perceived in online communities . In other contexts , prior work has explored various mechanisms to manipulate the perceived norms of a community . Examples include the prevalence of content exhibiting certain behaviors [ 21 , 32 , 34 , 81 ] , the response of commu - nity members to those behaviors ( e . g . , via supportive or opposing comments ) [ 37 , 53 , 70 ] , and the expectations established by the community ( e . g . , explicit rules on social media platforms ) [ 31 , 82 ] . With one exception [ 81 ] , these prior studies employed these mech - anisms to manipulate social norms ( e . g . , using confederates ) and explored the effects of those norms on individuals’ behaviors , but they did not directly measure whether these mechanisms actually influenced participants’ perceptions of those norms . Thus , it is not clear whether the effects of these mechanisms on individual’s be - haviors occur through influencing perceived norms . In addition , it is also not clear by which of these mechanisms a community’s norms are most readily perceived in the context of conspiratorial content and related misinformation . Furthermore , little is known about how perceived norms around conspiratorial content might then lead to other broad impressions about online communities . While the role of perceived norms could be investigated in the context of many different conspiracy theories [ e . g . , 102 , 141 ] , those around vaccination offer a valuable testbed for three main reasons . First , vaccination is a contentious topic , and there are many con - spiracy theories associated with this issue ( e . g . , harmful side effects of vaccines are hidden from the public , vaccines are pushed by phar - maceutical companies and government to make money ) [ 63 , 64 ] . Such misleading theories can influence people’s vaccination inten - tions and more broadly their trust in science and health authori - ties [ 63 , 65 ] . Second , perceived norms are specifically relevant in the context of vaccination and its surrounding conspiracy theories . In particular , numerous conspiracy theories about vaccines , espe - cially during health crises ( e . g . , the COVID - 19 pandemic ) , make the situation uncertain for many people . In such situations , and to deal with the involved uncertainty , people are highly likely to look to others’ behaviors to determine what is normative , and use that as guidance about appropriate behaviors ( i . e . , perceived norms ) [ 86 , 121 , 137 ] . Thus , understanding how people perceive norms of their community is particularly important in this context and can impact people’s decisions around vaccination . Third , the anti - vaccine conspiracy theories and related misinformation are crucial concerns for the ongoing ( i . e . , the COVID - 19 pandemic ) , and also future global health crises . Expanding knowledge about perceptions of norms around anti - vaccine behaviors can inform ways to mitigate the impacts of such misleading theories on indi - viduals and online communities . However , despite its importance , relatively less is known about how norms are perceived in this context . Thus , this paper investigates the effects of the aforementioned mechanisms on perceived norms around conspiratorial content and related misinformation in online settings . To do so , it presents two studies that focus on perceived norms around anti - vaccine conspiracies and related misinformation . These studies investigate how the previously mentioned mechanisms ( i . e . , the prevalence of certain behaviors , the community’s response to such behaviors , and the presence or absence of explicit community rules ) can directly influence norm perception , as well as the broader impacts of such perceived norms . Thus , this paper has four primary goals : to inves - tigate ( 1 ) the mechanisms by which people perceive a community’s norms around conspiratorial content and related misinformation , ( 2 ) the relationship between ( the mechanisms of ) norm percep - tion and social tolerance , and ( 3 ) the relationship between ( the mechanisms of ) norm perception and expectations around esca - lated behaviors , both within and outside a community , and ( 4 ) the relationship between ( the mechanisms of ) norm perception and ex - pectations about a community’s beliefs around other conspiratorial topics not directly exhibited within the community . To answer these questions , we developed two complementary between - subjects experiments . In both experiments , motivated by prior work discussed above [ 37 , 53 , 70 , 81 , 82 ] , we examined the effects of aforementioned mechanisms through manipulating three variables : ( 1 ) the ratio of anti - vaccine posts the participants observe , ( 2 ) the way the community’s members respond to the anti - vaccine posts ( i . e . , supportive vs . opposing the anti - vaccine content ) , and ( 3 ) the presence or absence of explicit community rules around misinformation . The combined results from these two studies provide insights about how the prevalence of misleading content , even when con - stituting a minority of posts in the feed , impacts different types of perceived norms and broader impressions about the community . However , the way other members of the community respond to such content can also strongly impact norm perceptions , thus in some cases mitigating the effects of misleading content on norm perceptions . In addition , while prior work suggests that making a community’s rules explicit might impact individuals’ behaviors [ e . g . , 82 ] , none of the conducted experiments support the effects of this intervention in addressing the perceptions about a community’s What’s the Norm Around Here ? Individuals’ Responses Can Mitigate the Effects of Misinformation Prevalence CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany norms . Moreover , perceived norms contribute to broader expecta - tions about the community as a whole . Specifically , people’s percep - tions of norms regarding a certain conspiracy theory guide their expectations around how the community would respond to other conspiracy theories not directly observed in the community , as well as expectations around escalated behaviors both within and outside the community . The paper concludes by discussing the implications that the findings suggest for the design , policies , and governing online communities . 2 Related work This section reviews prior work on the definition and impacts of social norms . It illustrates two different types of social norms , known as collective norms and perceived norms [ 109 – 111 ] , and highlights the importance of perceived norms compared to col - lective norms on people’s behavior . It illustrates how perceived norms influence people’s behaviors in a variety of subjects [ e . g . , 26 , 34 , 77 , 81 , 109 , 111 , 129 ] . Next , it outlines the role that perceived norms play on individuals’ response to conspiratorial and related misinformation [ 37 , 53 , 70 ] . 2 . 1 Social Norms : A key Mechanism that Impacts Individuals’ Behavior Social norms are defined as “rules or standards that are under - stood by members of a group , and guide and / or constrain social behavior without the force of law” [ 34 , p . 152 ] . Social norms influ - ence people’s opinions and behaviors in a variety of subjects [ e . g . , 26 , 77 , 81 , 111 , 129 ] . For example , norms of underage or exces - sive drinking influence people’s opinions about acceptable drink - ing habits and can in turn influence their own consumption pat - terns [ 91 , 93 ] . What matters here is not the actual prevalence of underage or excessive drinking , referred to as collective norms . Instead , it is perceived norms , perceptions of others’ behaviors [ 30 , 33 , 72 , 111 ] , that influence an individual’s opinions and be - haviors . People’s perceptions of norms ( i . e . , perceived norms ) can diverge from the actual norms ( i . e . , collective norms ) [ 72 ] . For example , students often held exaggerated perceptions about the prevalence of drinking [ 101 ] . Such perceptions influence some in - dividuals to rationalize their own excessive drinking habits [ 72 ] . The stronger influences of perceived norms compared to col - lective norms occurs for at least three reasons [ 91 , 93 , 111 ] . First , prior studies show that many people are often poor at estimating collective norms [ 84 , 101 ] . For example , Perkins and Berkowitz [ 101 ] show students tend to perceive alcohol consumption as more prevalent than it actually is . These perceived norms influence peo - ple to believe their alcohol consumption patterns are within the prevailing norms of their community [ 91 , 93 ] . Second , people can - not make inferences about others’ actual beliefs independent of their own perceptions of others’ beliefs and attitudes [ 111 ] . That is , individuals’ knowledge about others’ beliefs and attitudes is influenced by their perceptions and interpretations of their social interactions with others , which is inherently subjective [ 72 ] . Third , prior work demonstrates that even if people are informed about others’ actual views , still their behaviors are influenced more by their perceptions of others’ behaviors compared to others’ actual behaviors [ 111 ] . There are three types of perceived norms , which refer to people’s perceptions of what others do ( i . e . , descriptive norms ) , what others approve of and what they condemn ( i . e . , injunctive norms ) , and how an individual thinks they are expected to behave ( i . e . , subjective norms ) [ 30 , 32 , 34 , 111 ] . All three types of perceived norms can in - fluence people’s behaviors via different mechanisms [ 98 , 111 , 121 ] . For example , observing a behavior repeatedly within a community leads people to perceive the behavior as part of the community’s norms ( i . e . , descriptive norms ) [ e . g . , 90 , 119 ] , and a desire for so - cial conformity increases the likelihood of people exhibiting that behavior themselves [ 110 , 111 ] . As another example , when people perceive a certain behavior as approved by a community ( i . e . , in - junctive norms ) , they are more likely to approve of the behavior and adopt it themselves [ 32 , 72 ] . Similarly , people’s behavior is in - fluenced by their perceptions of others’ expectations ( i . e . , subjective norms ) , due to their desire to avoid risking interpersonal harmony by going against others’ expectations [ 30 ] . In online communities , perceived norms can similarly influence people’s impressions about popular opinions and behaviors , and consequently impact their opinions and behavior [ e . g . , 48 , 81 , 82 , 107 ] . For example , people’s opinion about acceptable language in online discussion [ 58 , 82 ] , privacy concerns [ 48 , 81 , 107 ] , reliabil - ity of different pieces of news [ 37 , 53 , 99 ] and views of different events [ 102 , 139 ] are shaped based on what they perceived as preva - lent among ( i . e . , descriptive ) , and approved of ( i . e . , injunctive ) , by others within their community . While numerous studies acknowledges the influence of perceived norms online , the mechanisms by which norms have their influ - ences online may have some differences with those in offline set - tings . For example , anonymous online settings [ 43 , 75 ] , lack of nonverbal cues [ 16 ] , among others , can impact the ways by which people perceive and are influenced by social norms . Therefore , it is important to explore the mechanism by which norms are perceived and impact online communities . 2 . 2 The Role of Perceived Norms on Individuals’ Response to Conspiratorial Content and Related Misinformation Perceived norms particularly influence people’s behavior around conspiratorial content and related misinformation [ 11 , 37 , 53 , 70 , 99 , 120 , 139 ] . Specifically , perceived norms play a role on the types of content that people share within their community [ 11 , 13 , 92 , 99 , 139 ] , and the way they identify misinformation and respond to it [ 37 , 53 , 70 ] . For example , Colliander [ 37 ] demonstrates that many people’s perceptions of news credibility are influenced by the re - sponses of others . That is , if others point out the news is fake , they are more likely to consider it as fake news as well , and less likely to share it [ 37 ] . In an experimental study , Andı and Akesson [ 11 ] design an intervention based on descriptive norms , wherein partic - ipants are shown a message that suggests most people think twice before sharing news . They show that displaying this normative information can make people less likely to share fake articles and il - lustrate this influence occurs due to norm conformity to descriptive norms . In another experiment , however , Gimpel et al . [ 53 ] show that injunctive norms most strongly influence people’s response to fake news compared to descriptive norms . Specifically , they show CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Zhila Aghajari , Eric P . S . Baumer , and Dominic DiFranzo that highlighting reporting fake news as a socially desired behavior using an injunctive norm intervention leads to higher reporting rates for fake news , while descriptive norms do not have such an effect . Koo et al . [ 70 ] , instead of manipulating perceived norms and investigating their effects , directly ask participants about percep - tions of norms of correcting misinformation . Specifically , they ask , “If a typical American has posted information that was made - up , how likely is it that they will correct it ? ” . Their analysis reveals that perceived norms around self - correct influence individuals to self - correct themselves . The impacts of perceived norms are particularly significant when people try to make sense of conspiracy theories [ 39 , 102 , 141 ] . In - deed , conspiracy theories are often associated with incomplete , uncertain data [ 102 , 141 ] . To deal with such uncertainty , many peo - ple tend to look to others’ behavior for guidance about appropriate behaviors [ 86 , 121 , 137 ] . To deal with uncertainly involved in con - spiracy theories , people similarly look at how others respond to such arguments as guidance Cookson et al . [ 39 ] , Xiao et al . [ 141 ] . Given the role of perceived norms around conspiracy theories , it is important to explore the mechanisms by which these norms are perceived . 3 Mechanisms of Perceiving a Community’s Norms in an Online Context While a growing body of work acknowledges the role of perceived norms on individuals’ response to misinformation [ e . g . , 11 , 37 , 53 , 70 ] , relatively less work has explored the mechanisms by which norms around conspiracies and misinformation are perceived . Studies in other contexts have provided insights into how in - dividuals might perceive norms in offline and online settings . In offline settings , observing a behavior as common among others is a key source of information that influence individuals’ behaviors around various topics [ 21 , 32 , 34 ] . This influence could potentially occur via influencing the perceived norms [ 32 ] . Indeed , recent work has explored and acknowledged that observing common behaviors of others regarding privacy practices influences people’s privacy settings in online settings [ 18 , 81 , 131 ] . For example , if others within the community have private profiles , participants are more likely to have private profiles as well [ 81 ] . Masur et al . [ 81 ] show that this influence occurs through influencing perceived norms around privacy concerns . We hypothesize that this relationship between observing exhibitions of common behavior and perceived norms will similarly hold in the context of conspiratorial content and re - lated misinformation . More precisely , we posit that the prevalence of posts that exhibit anti - vaccine behaviors in an online commu - nity results in a higher perception of norms around anti - vaccine behavior . H1 : Seeing a higher prevalence of posts with anti - vaccine con - tent will result in higher participants’ perception of norms about anti - vaccine beliefs and behaviors . This includes ( H1 . a ) descriptive , ( H1 . b ) injunctive , and ( H1 . c ) subjective norms . Another element that influences individuals’ response to various issues is how other people respond to it [ 37 , 53 , 70 ] . For example , as discussed in Section 2 . 2 , many people tend to read others’ com - ments to a piece of content when deciding whether or not to share it , and how to respond to it themselves [ 37 ] . This influence becomes strong when the situation involves uncertainty [ 86 , 121 , 137 ] , which is particularly true regarding conspiracy theories and related mis - information . This work aims to investigate whether this influence of others’ responses occurs via influencing perceived norms . H2 : When users respond to anti - vaccine content with support , participants’ perceptions of norms about anti - vaccine beliefs and behaviors will increase , and when users respond to anti - vaccine content with opposition , participants’ perceptions of such norms will decrease . This includes ( H2 . a ) descriptive , ( H2 . b ) injunctive , and ( H2 . c ) subjective norms . Another source of information that informs people about com - munity’s norms can be through the expectations established by institutions [ 31 ] , especially when institutions indicate the ways by which those expectations will be enforced [ 40 , 108 ] . For example , Matias [ 82 ] demonstrates that providing normative information in the form of community rules decreases unruly and harassing conversations . Matias [ 82 ] argues that these effects occur by in - fluencing perceptions around what is normative in a community . In this study , we explore whether displaying a community’s rules actually influences perceived norms , and will similarly hold in the context of anti - vaccine content . H3 : Seeing a community’s established rules about misinforma - tion will result in lower participants’ norm perceptions of anti - vaccine beliefs and behaviors . This includes ( H3 . a ) descriptive , ( H3 . b ) injunctive , and ( H3 . c ) subjective norms . 3 . 1 Perceived Norms and Social Tolerance Perceived norms can lead people to tolerate events that they used to prohibit [ 29 , 97 ] . An individual may disapprove of a particular behavior , but if they perceive that the community thinks that be - havior is normative they may be willing to tolerate it . For example , if LGBTQ + behaviors are perceived as normative , individual people who do not approve of such identities may nonetheless be willing to tolerate them because of those norm perceptions [ 50 ] . Such social tolerance is distinct from injunctive norms , which refer to people’s perceptions of what others approve of . In contrast , perceived social tolerance refers to what people believe others are willing to tolerate . These perceptions can be as important as per - ceived norms , as they can affect how people choose to behave , and how they react to the behaviors of others [ 51 ] . For example , when disparaging humor ( e . g . , racist or sexist humor ) is observed as socially tolerated , regardless of whether or not this behavior is approved by others ( i . e . , injunctive norms ) , people high in hostile sexism or those high in racism may be more likely to exhibit such behaviors . In addition , observing these behaviors as socially toler - ated may make other people less likely to speak up against such behaviors . In online communities , perceptions of social tolerance can sim - ilarly affect people’s behaviors [ 10 , 50 ] . The effects include both positives and negatives . For example , social tolerance of marginal - ized groups such as LGBTQ + individuals can reduce prejudiced attitudes towards them on social media [ 50 ] . On the other hand , social tolerance of toxic language online can increase instances of toxic conversations [ 10 , 82 ] . Social tolerance of conspiratorial con - tent and misinformation can similarly have negative consequences . Examples include increasing the spread of conspiracy theories and What’s the Norm Around Here ? Individuals’ Responses Can Mitigate the Effects of Misinformation Prevalence CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Figure 1 : We hypothesize that the prevalence of conspiratorial content ( e . g . , anti - vaccine content ) , the response of community members to such content , and the community’s established rules impact different types of perceived norms ( i . e . , descriptive , injunctive , and subjective ) , as well as broader perceptions about the community ( e . g . , social tolerance and escalated behaviors ) . expanding their reach and influencing perceptions around the pop - ularity of such misleading theories [ 69 , 89 , 104 ] . This study examines how different elements of an online com - munity influence perceptions of social tolerance of anti - vaccine behaviors . It asks : RQ1 . a : What elements in an online community ( i . e . , prevalence of anti - vaccine content , the response of other users , and community rules ) play a role on participants’ perceptions of social tolerance of anti - vaccine behaviors in the community ? In addition , this study examines whether perceptions of different types of perceived norms around anti - vaccine behaviors influence perceptions around social tolerance of such behaviors in a commu - nity . It asks : RQ1 . b : Do participants’ perceptions of a community’s norms ( i . e . , descriptive norms , injunctive norms , subjective norms ) online influence their perceptions around social tolerance of anti - vaccine behaviors in that community ? 3 . 2 Perceived Norms and Escalated Behaviors As discussed in Section 2 , people’s perceptions of social norms are often inaccurate and sometimes even deviated from the actual norms ( i . e . , collective norms ) [ 110 , 111 ] . In particular , people might form exaggerated perceptions about a community’s norms , thereby consider escalated behaviors as normative as well [ 110 , 111 ] . For example , people sometimes develop exaggerated beliefs about oth - ers’ alcohol consumption , thus consider their excessive alcohol consumption as normative based on their inaccurate perceptions of norms [ 101 ] . Put differently , the ( inaccurate ) perception of exces - sive alcohol consumption as normative contributes to an escalation of an individual’s alcohol consumption . In online contexts , exaggerated perceptions of social norms can similarly lead people to consider escalated behaviors as normative . For example , people might hold exaggerated perceptions of norms of toxic language [ 82 ] . As a result , they may consider escalated toxic conversations as normative as well , while such escalated conversa - tions are neither pervasive ( i . e . , descriptive norms ) nor approved by the majority ( i . e . , injunctive norms ) , or expected by the major - ity ( i . e . , subjective norms ) . Perceiving escalated behaviors of toxic language as normative can lead people to tolerate , approve of , or even engage in toxic conversations themselves [ 28 , 82 ] . In addition , such perceptions can discourage many people from engaging in discussions to avoid potential consequences [ 35 , 87 ] . Recent work suggests that people might similarly hold exagger - ated perceptions of norms around conspiracy theories , and overes - timate the extent to which others endorse conspiracy theories [ 39 ] . Do such exaggerated perceptions of norms around conspiracy the - ories lead to expectations around escalated behaviors around this topic ? This study examines whether and how the elements of an online community influence people’s expectations around escalated behaviors in the context of anti - vaccine behaviors . It asks : RQ2 . a : What elements of an online community ( i . e . , prevalence of anti - vaccine content , the response of other users , and commu - nity’s rules ) play a role on participants’ expectations around exhi - bitions of escalated behaviors by members of the community ? In addition , this study explores whether and how perceived norms and / or perceived social tolerance of anti - vaccine behaviors in an online community lead to expectations around an exhibition of escalated behaviors around this topic by members of the community . It asks : RQ2 . b : Do participants’ perceptions of a community’s norms and / or social tolerance of anti - vaccine behaviors guide their expec - tations around escalated behaviors around this topic ? Figure 1 depicts the hypotheses and the research questions dis - cussed in this section . CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Zhila Aghajari , Eric P . S . Baumer , and Dominic DiFranzo 4 Study 1 This study investigated the effects of three independent variables : the prevalence of anti - vaccine content , the response of commu - nity members to such content , and displaying explicit community - established rules about such content . It measured how each of these affected three dependent variables : perceived norms around anti - vaccine content , social tolerance of anti - vaccine content , and expectations about escalated behaviors related to such content . This section presents Study 1’s methods , including the procedure , partic - ipant recruitment , experimental design , measures to operationalize our key variables , and the data analysis methods , followed by the results and discussion thereof . 4 . 1 Procedure The consent form , including information about the study’s require - ments and its length , was shown to the participants . After con - senting to participate , the participants were given instructions as follows . They were asked to scroll through and read over a screen - shot of a feed from an online community , for 10 minutes . The feed consisted of 50 posts and their respective comments are created using a social media platform for experimental studies , called Eat - Snap . Love ( Described in detail in section 6 . 1 ) . The content of the posts and the responses were created by researchers in Social De - sign Lab at Lehigh University . The posts were related to various everyday topics , in addition to the study’s manipulated variables based on the experimental conditions ( Described below ) . These posts were controlled to be about everyday life ( e . g . , posting food , photographs of nature , and sports activities ) , and not to include any political opinions in them . The posts related to anti - vaccine content were informed by the anti - vaccine posts on different social media platforms and crafted by the first author , and several research assistants at Social Design Lab . The authors pilot - tested the posts iteratively and refined the posts to ensure posts are not artificial and resembled a realistic experimental setting . After reading the content in the screenshot , participants were asked about their perceptions of the community using the measures described below . 4 . 2 Ethical Consideration Our experimental design involves exposing our participants to vac - cine misinformation . Prior work shows that exposure to vaccine misinformation can impact people’s opinion about vaccines [ 78 , 124 ] . To account for such potential consequences , after the ex - periment , we debriefed our participants about the purpose of the experiments and informed them about how the content related to vaccines that they observed during the experiment was misin - formation and intentionally misleading . In addition , we provided our participants with information about the safety and efficacy of vaccines . Prior work suggests that corrective information is effective in addressing the effects of being exposed to health misin - formation [ 62 , 68 , 76 , 136 ] . We also provided our participants with information about the harm that sharing such content can have for individuals , and the broader society . In addition , our experimental design involves deceptions about how other actors in the platform are real people , and how the content is created by those actors . The decision not to disclose this information to our participants was made to ensure they engage with the experiment , and to improve experimental realism in our study . Thus , after the experiment , we debriefed our participants about this deception as well . We informed them that every actor in the feed was actually a bot , and all the content was crafted by the researchers . We explained the reasons why we did not reveal this information prior to the experiment ( i . e . , to improve experimental realism and to help with the validity of our experimental findings ) . The procedures for this study were approved by the IRB at Lehigh University . 4 . 3 Recruitment and Participants Data was collected during July 2021 . 1939 participants were re - cruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk to participate in the study . Participants were compensated $ 1 for their time . After the removal of the participants who failed an attention check ( n = 549 ) , our final sample was 1390 . We conducted a power analysis for a small effect size ( f = 0 . 15 ) with 0 . 95 power and determined we should need 1093 participants . Thus , our sample met the required size based on our power analysis . The participants reported a mean age of 40 . 78 ( SD = 12 . 94 ) . Fifty seven percent of the participants ( n = 803 ) were female , forty per - cent were male ( n = 566 ) , one percent were non - binary ( n = 15 ) , and less than one percent of the participants ( n = 6 ) preferred not to disclose their gender . The majority of our sample was white ( 80 . 14 % ) , followed by Black or African American ( 9 . 42 % ) , Asian ( 5 . 32 % ) , Hispanic , Latino , or Spanish ( 3 . 88 % ) , and all other races and ethnicities were less than 1 % . The distribution of education among participants was as follows : 4 . 34 % high school incomplete or less , 16 . 6 % high school graduate , 9 . 85 % some college degree , 37 . 5 % four year college degree or bachelor’s degree , 31 . 1 % some post graduate school but not graduate degree , and 0 . 63 % postgraduate or profes - sional degree . Neither age ( F ( 1378 , 11 ) = 0 . 901 , p = 0 . 538 ) nor gender ( 𝜒 2 = 6 . 758 , p = 0 . 818 ) , race ( 𝜒 2 = 60 . 07 , p = 0 . 681 ) , and education ( 𝜒 2 = 68 . 394 , p = 0 . 12 ) differed by experimental condition . 4 . 4 Experimental Design For the three independent variables ( i . e . , prevalence , community re - sponse , and explicit rules ) , we employed a 3 x 2 x 2 between - subjects experimental design . The prevalence of anti - vaccine content was manipulated based on the ratio of anti - vaccine posts in each ex - perimental condition . Specifically , depending on the experimental condition , each participant saw a feed with either 5 % , 30 % , or 60 % of the posts showing anti - vaccine content . The community’s re - sponse to anti - vaccine posts was manipulated to either support or oppose the anti - vaccine posts . See Figures 2a , and 2b for examples of pro - vaccine and anti - vaccine responses . The presence or absence of the community’s established rules was controlled to examine the effects of this element on norms perceptions . To do so , in the condi - tion with the presence of the community’s rules , the community’s rules were displayed using a “sticky note” on the side of the feed , and in the condition with the absence of the community’s rules , this sticky note was not displayed ( Figure 2c ) . Other content of the feed was kept identical across the experimental conditions . What’s the Norm Around Here ? Individuals’ Responses Can Mitigate the Effects of Misinformation Prevalence CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) Figure 2 : Figures ( a ) and ( b ) show two examples of posts with anti - vaccine content . Figure ( a ) shows examples of community members’ responses to anti - vaccine content with opposition , and figure ( b ) shows examples of responses to anti - vaccine content with support . Figure ( c ) shows a screenshot of the community’s established rules , that is displayed on the participants’ news feed during the experiment . 4 . 5 Measures 4 . 5 . 1 Perceptions of Norms To measure participants’ perceptions of norms , the scale developed by Park and Smith [ 98 ] was adopted and modified to fit the focus of this study . This scale includes four items for descriptive norms ( e . g . , “The majority of people on EatSnap . Love post anti - vaccine content” ) , four items for injunctive norms ( e . g . , “The majority of people on EatSnap . Love approve of posting anti - vaccine posts . ” ) , and four items for subjective norms ( e . g . , “The majority of people on EatSnap . Love expect others to share anti - vaccine posts . ” ) . All of these items are measured using a 7 - point scale ranging from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 7 ( strongly agree ) 1 [ 98 ] . In our data , this scale demonstrates a high degree of reliability for each type of perceived norms , that is descriptive norms ( 𝛼 = 0 . 99 , 𝑀 = 4 . 44 , 𝑆𝐷 = 0 . 07 ) , injunctive norms ( 𝛼 = 0 . 97 , 𝑀 = 4 . 123 , 𝑆𝐷 = 0 . 080 ) , and subjective norms ( 𝛼 = 0 . 95 , 𝑀 = 3 . 784 , 𝑆𝐷 = 0 . 164 ) . Since this study aims to investigate the mechanisms of perceiving each type of perceived norms , different types of perceived norms are considered as distinct factors in the analysis . 4 . 5 . 2 Perceptions of Social Tolerance Participant perceptions of how anti - vaccine content is tolerated by people in the EatSnap . Love community were measured using a self - developed scale . This scale 1 Across all measures that pertain to vaccine attitudes , higher numbers indicate greater anti - vaccine norms . includesthreequestions ( i . e . , “Themajorityof peopleonEatSnap . Love do not mind if other users share posts with anti - vaccine content . ” , “The majority of people on EatSnap . Love tolerate posting anti - vaccine content . ” , and “The majority of people on EatSanp . Love think it is okay for people to express their anti - vaccine beliefs . ” ) . It demonstrates a high degree of reliability ( 𝛼 = 0 . 97 , 𝑀 = 4 . 24 , 𝑆𝐷 = 0 . 10 ) . 4 . 5 . 3 Expectations of Escalated Behaviors Prior studies ( discussed in Section 3 . 2 ) suggest that perceiving certain behaviors as norma - tive can lead to escalated behaviors . This study explores whether people’s perceptions of norms around anti - vaccine content create expectations around escalated behaviors related to conspiratorial content . To do so , participants are asked about their expectations around escalated anti - vaccine behaviors by members of the Eat - Snap . Love community . Specifically , two posts that display examples of escalated behaviors are shown to the participants ( See Figure 3 ) . Participants are asked about how the EatSnap . Love community would respond to these posts ( e . g . , “The majority of people on EatSnap . love would share this post . ” , “The majority of people in Eat - Snap . Love would approve of this post” ) . Responses were solicited from 1 = “Extremely unlikely” to 7 = “Extremely Likely” . In addition , participants are asked some questions about escalated behaviors in offline settings ( e . g . , The majority of people on EatSnap . love are CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Zhila Aghajari , Eric P . S . Baumer , and Dominic DiFranzo likely to join a protest to fight for their anti - vaccine beliefs ) . How - ever , given that the reliability score for this question was not high , we combined them with the questions about escalated behaviors in the community . This way , study 1 uses a single scale for measuring and analyzing perceptions of escalated behaviors . The scale demon - strates a high degree of reliability ( 𝛼 = 0 . 81 , 𝑀 = 4 . 12 , 𝑆𝐷 = 0 . 08 ) . 4 . 6 Data Analysis The effects related to our hypotheses and research questions were investigated using structural equation modeling ( SEM ) [ 59 , 126 ] . This approach is chosen for two reasons . First , the dependent vari - ables of this study are highly correlated , requiring a model that takes into account the variables’ correlations . Second , based on our hypotheses , the perceptions of social tolerance and escalated behaviors can depend on the latent factors of perceived norms . SEM helps to estimate the hypothesis of a hierarchical structure , required for modeling perceived social tolerance and perceived escalated behaviors . The SEM analysis is conducted in R using Lavaan package [ 116 ] . Figure 4 depicts the results of this analysis . The multi - dimensional model fitted the data well ( 𝜒 2 ( 367 ) = 3088 . 142 , 𝑝 < . 001 , 𝐶𝐹𝐼 = 0 . 96 , 𝑇𝐿𝐼 = 0 . 95 ; 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸𝐴 = 0 . 074 , 𝑆𝑅𝑀𝑅 = 0 . 164 ) . Tukey’s WSD ( Wholly Significant Difference ) post - hoc tests using simultane - ous 95 % confidence intervals is used for multiple comparisons between experimental groups [ 103 ] . Specifically , we used the func - tion tukeySEM in R to conduct Tukey’s WSD post - hoc analysis [ 83 ] . Demographics are included in the models as between - subjects co - variates , and are reported when significant . While SEM is chosen for the aforementioned reasons , the Lavaan package in R that is used to conduct the SEM analysis does not support analysis of interactions 2 [ 6 , 116 ] . Therefore , the poten - tial interaction effects are examined using multivariate analysis of variance ( MANOVA ) . Tukey’s honestly significant difference ( HSD ) tests using simultaneous 95 % confidence intervals are used for investigating the details of the interaction effects . Due to the hypothesis of a hierarchical structure between perceived norms and the broader perceptions about the community ( i . e . , perceptions of social tolerance , and expectations of escalated behaviors ) , the potential interaction effects of the manipulated variables are only investigated for the perceived norms , and they are only reported when significant . 4 . 7 Results of Study 1 The analysis investigates how each of the manipulated elements of the community ( i . e . , the prevalence of anti - vaccine content , the response of community members to such content , and displaying explicit community - established rules about such content ) affected three dependent variables : perceived norms around anti - vaccine content , social tolerance of anti - vaccine content , and expectations about escalated behaviors . This section organizes the results based on the dependent variables and shows how each of these variables are affected by different elements of a community . 4 . 7 . 1 Perceived Descriptive Norms In line with our prediction in H1 . a , prevalence of posts with certain behaviors ( i . e . , anti - vaccine 2 While the Lavvan package allows for specifying the interaction terms in the SEM model , when fitting the model it does not include those interaction terms . content ) had a positive , and significant effect on perceived descrip - tive norms of anti - vaccination ( 𝐵 = 0 . 43 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . Based on Tukey’s WSD post - hoc analysis , there was a significant difference across all levels of posts with anti - vaccine content ( 5 % , 30 % , and 60 % ) . However , the difference in perceived descriptive norms was larger between conditions with 5 % and 30 % anti - vaccine posts com - pared to the difference between conditions with 30 % and 60 % anti - vaccine posts ( 0 . 96 vs . 0 . 19 ) . These results suggest that a relatively small sharing of anti - vaccine posts might provide enough evidence for people to form perceptions about a community’s attitudes to - wards anti - vaccine behaviors . The response of other users to the anti - vaccine content also had significant effects on perceptions of descriptive norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 51 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) ( supporting H2 . a ) . The effects of community mem - bers’ response to anti - vaccine content on perceived descriptive norms were relatively larger than the effect of prevalence of anti - vaccine content ( 𝐵 = 0 . 51 ) vs . ( 𝐵 = 0 . 43 ) . These results connote that even if anti - vaccine posts are shared frequently in an online community when the other members of the community speak up against such misleading content , they can mitigate the effects of sharing such content on perceptions of the community’s descrip - tive norms . Figure 5a depicts the way the prevalence of content impacts perceptions of descriptive norms , and how these effects are mitigated by the way community members respond to such content . A small but significant interaction effect occurred between the prevalence of anti - vaccine content and the response of community members to such content ( 𝐹 ( 1356 , 2 ) = 9 . 71 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . A post - hoc Tukey HSD test reveals that , unsurprisingly , higher ratios of anti - vaccine comments and the presence of supportive comments to these posts boost each others’ effects . However , the commu - nity’s response to anti - vaccine content can mitigate the effects of such content on perceived descriptive norms . For example , in a condition wherein 30 % of posts exhibit anti - vaccine behaviors , but the community responds to those posts via opposing comments , the perceived norms of anti - vaccine are lower compared to the condition wherein only 5 % of the posts are anti - vaccine but the community responds to those posts via supportive comments ( i . e . , anti - vaccine comments ) ( M = 3 . 71 vs . M = 4 . 13 , P < 0 . 001 ) . Displaying the community’s established rules , however , had neither a large nor statistically significant effect on participants’ perceptions of descriptive norms in our results ( i . e . , there is insuf - ficient evidence to support H3 . a ) . The community’s rules did not show any interaction effects with the other manipulated variables of the experiment either . 4 . 7 . 2 Perceived Injunctive Norms Prevalence of posts with anti - vaccine content greatly and significantly impacted perceived injunc - tive norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 23 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) , supporting H1 . b . Tukey’s WSD Post - hoc tests demonstrate while the difference between perceived injunctive norms in conditions with 5 % and 30 % was significant , the conditions with 30 % and 60 % ratio of anti - vaccine posts did not result in significant difference in perceptive injunctive norms . This result suggests that even if the posts that state certain behavior ( e . g . , anti - vaccine ) constitute the minority of the posts , they still can greatly influence what the community as a whole approves of ( i . e . , injunctive norms ) . The response of other users to the anti - vaccine What’s the Norm Around Here ? Individuals’ Responses Can Mitigate the Effects of Misinformation Prevalence CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany ( a ) ( b ) Figure 3 : Examples of posts that show escalated behaviors regarding anti - vaccine behaviors ( i . e . , protesting to fight against vaccinations , and spreading a message to support an anti - vaccine movement . Figure 4 : The SEM results show that , of the community elements tested , the community’s response to anti - vaccine conspiratorial content has the strongest effect on perceptions of all three types of norms . These norm perceptions in turn predict participants’ expectations about the community , both their tolerance for anti - vaccine beliefs and behaviors , and their expectations about escalated behaviors . posts had a greater , and significant effect on perceived injunctive norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 72 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) ( supporting H2 . b ) . The greater role of other members’ responses to anti - vaccine content on perceived injunctive norms suggests that the community members can mit - igate the effects of frequent sharing of anti - vaccine content on perceptions around what the community approves or disapprove of . Figure 5b depicts the way the prevalence of content impacts per - ceptions of injunctive norms , and how these effects are mitigated by the way community members respond to such content . There was a moderate and significant interaction effect between the prevalence of anti - vaccine content and the community’s re - sponse to such content in terms of perceived injunctive norms CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Zhila Aghajari , Eric P . S . Baumer , and Dominic DiFranzo ( a ) Descriptive Norms ( b ) Injunctive Norms ( c ) Subjective Norms Figure 5 : The effect of prevalence of anti - vaccine content ( i . e . , the ratio of anti - vaccine posts ) , and the community members’ response to anti - vaccine posts on perceived A ) descriptive , B ) injunctive , and C ) subjective norms around anti - vaccine behaviors . Greater values indicate perceptions of anti - vaccine beliefs and behaviors as more normative . The spread of anti - vaccine content , even when constituting the minority of the posts in the feed , influences perceived norms around anti - vaccine behaviors . However , the way community members respond to such content can mitigate its effects . ( 𝐹 ( 1356 , 2 ) = 35 . 2562 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . A post - hoc Tukey HSD test shows that , similar to descriptive norms , the community’s response to anti - vaccine content , if having an opposing stance , can mitigate the effects of the prevalence of anti - vaccine content . For example , in a condition wherein the anti - vaccine posts constitute 60 % of the posts on the feed , but the community members oppose such content in the response , the perceived injunctive norms on average are lower compared to when the anti - vaccine posts only constitute 5 % of the posts but the community shows supports for such content ( M = 2 . 96 vs . M = 4 . 46 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Perceived injunctive norms , similar to perceived descriptive norms , were not statistically significantly affected by the com - munity’s established rules in our results ( i . e . , there is insufficient evidence to support H3 . b ) . However , the results show that the com - munity’s rules have a small but statistically significant interaction effect with the prevalence of anti - vaccine content ( 𝐹 ( 1356 , 2 ) = 3 . 83 , 𝑝 = 0 . 021 ) . The post - hoc Tukey test suggests that display - ing a community’s rules can amplify the effects of the prevalence of content on perceived injunctive norms . Specifically , when the prevalence of anti - vaccine content aligns with the community’s rules against misinformation , participants on average reported even lower perceived injunctive norms compared to when the rules are not displayed . Put differently , when the prevalence of misinforma - tion is relatively low , displaying the community’s rules resulted in further lowering the perceived injunctive norms . However , when the prevalence of content contradicts the explicit community rules about misinformation , participants reported even higher injunctive norms . For example , when the anti - vaccine content constitutes 30 % of the post on the feed , displaying the community’s rules about misinformation resulted in a further increased perceived injunctive norms compared to when the rules are absent . This pattern , how - ever , has not been observed for the condition wherein 60 % of the posts are anti - vaccine content ( See Figure 6a ) . 4 . 7 . 3 Perceived Subjective Norms Prevalence of posts with anti - vaccine content strongly and significantly predicted perceived sub - jective norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 30 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) ( supporting H1 . c ) . Tukey’s WSD post - hoc tests demonstrate that there is a significant differ - ence between conditions with 5 % and 30 % , and conditions with 5 % and 60 % posts with anti - vaccine content . However , the differ - ence between conditions with 30 % and 60 % anti - vaccine posts is small and non - significant . Again , the response of other users to anti - vaccine content most strongly , and significantly impacted per - ceived subjective norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 59 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) ( supporting H2 . c ) . That is , while frequent sharing of misleading content influences the expectations around anti - vaccine behaviors in a community , the response of other members can mitigate the effects of such content on perceived subjective norms . Figure 5c depicts the effects of the prevalence of content on perceptions of subjective norms , and how What’s the Norm Around Here ? Individuals’ Responses Can Mitigate the Effects of Misinformation Prevalence CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany ( a ) Injunctive Norms ( b ) Subjective Norms Figure 6 : Displaying the community’s rules can amplify the effects of the prevalence of content . When the anti - vaccine content has a lower prevalence ( i . e . , 5 % ) , displaying rules can lower the perceived anti - vaccine injunctive and subjective norms ( Green line compared to the red line at 5 % prevalence of content in Figure a ) and b ) respectively . ) However , when the anti - vaccine content has a higher proportion ( 30 % and 60 % , with one exception in figure a ) at 60 % ) , displaying community rules results in higher perceived injunctive and subjective norms . Note that greater values in these figures indicate perceptions of anti - vaccine beliefs and behaviors as more normative . these effects are mitigated by the way community members respond to such content . In addition , the interaction of the prevalence of anti - vaccine content and the response of community members to such content had a moderate , and statistically significant effect on the perceived subjective norms ( 𝐹 ( 1356 , 2 ) = 20 . 67 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . In particular , the results suggest that the community’s response that opposes anti - vaccine posts can mitigate the effects of such con - tent on perceived subjective norms . For example , in the condition wherein 60 % of the posts on the feed include anti - vaccine content , but the community members oppose those posts in the comments , the participants on average reported lower perceived subjective norms compared to the conditions wherein such posts are less prevalent ( i . e . , 30 % ) , yet supported in the community’s response ( M = 3 . 12 vs . M = 5 . 22 ) . Displaying the community’s established norms did not have any statistically significant effect on perceived subjective norms ( i . e . , there is insufficient evidence to support H3 . c ) . That is , even if the community’s rules emphasize the expectations around not sharing health misinformation , in our experiment , such expecta - tions are not seen as the community’s subjective norms . However , there was a small but significant interaction effect between the prevalence of anti - vaccine content and the presence or absence of the community’s rules in terms of perceived subjective norms ( 𝐹 ( 1356 , 2 ) = 3 . 65 , 𝑝 = 0 . 026 ) . In particular , the post - hoc Tukey HSD test suggests that displaying the community’s rules can am - plify the effects of the prevalence of content on perceived subjective norms . When the prevalence of anti - vaccine in the feed was rel - atively lower , displaying community rules about misinformation lowered the perceived subjective norms . However , when the preva - lence of content was relatively higher ( 30 % and 60 % compared to 5 % ) , the presence of community rules about misinformation further increased perceived subjective norms on average . These results suggest that when a community’s rules are not manifested in peo - ple’s behavior , making those rules explicit not only is less likely to address the effects of certain behaviors on the impressions about CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Zhila Aghajari , Eric P . S . Baumer , and Dominic DiFranzo the community , it may even amplify the effects of those behaviors on the perceptions about the community ( See Figure 6b ) . 4 . 7 . 4 Perceived Social Tolerance In response to RQ1 . a , the effects of the prevalence of posts with anti - vaccine content on perceptions around social tolerance of such content were very small , yet sig - nificant ( 𝐵 = 0 . 07 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . The response of others members of the community to anti - vaccine content had a relatively larger , and significant effect on perceptions around what the community is willing to tolerate ( i . e . , social tolerance ) ( 𝐵 = 0 . 19 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . However , displaying the community’s rules did not have any effect on this factor . With regard to RQ1 . b , different types of perceived norms influ - enced perceived social tolerance of anti - vaccine behaviors . How - ever , the size of these effects varied . In particular , perceived injunc - tive norms most strongly influenced perceived social tolerance of anti - vaccine behaviors ( 𝐵 = 0 . 65 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) , followed by perceived subjective norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 17 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) , and perceived descriptive norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 04 , 𝑝 < 0 . 05 ) . 4 . 7 . 5 Expectations of Escalated Behaviors In response to RQ2 . a , among the elements of the community ( i . e . , the prevalence of anti - vaccine content , the response of community members to such con - tent , and displaying explicit community - established rules about such content ) , only the response of community members to anti - vaccine content had a significant effect on expectations around esca - lated behaviors . However , this effect was very small ( 𝐵 = 0 . 07 , 𝑝 < 0 . 05 ) . Regarding RQ2 . b , all the three types of perceived norms ( i . e . , descriptive norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 29 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) , injunctive norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 22 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) , and subjective norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 22 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) ) had a large and significant effect on expectations around escalated be - haviors . In addition , participants’ perceptions of social tolerance are larger and significantly predict expectations around escalated behaviors ( 𝐵 = 0 . 21 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . We also investigated the potential impacts of demographics ( e . g . , gender , age , race ) on all three dependent variables , and found no significant effects . 4 . 8 Discussion of Study 1 As discussed , observing the prevalence of anti - vaccine content in - fluences perceived norms around anti - vaccine beliefs and behaviors . In particular , different degrees of the prevalence of anti - vaccine content lead to different perceptions of norms around anti - vaccine behaviors . However , the relationship between the prevalence of con - tent and perceptions of norms is unlikely to be linear . Specifically , the difference in perceived norms was larger between small ( i . e . , 5 % ) and moderate ( i . e . , 30 % ) prevalence of posts with anti - vaccine content in comparison with the difference between moderate ( i . e . , 30 % ) and large ( i . e . , 60 % ) ratio of posts with anti - vaccine content . This finding suggests that even when a minority of posts in the feed ( i . e . , 30 % ) exhibit a certain behavior , that behavior can be perceived as normal , both in terms of norms of what others do ( i . e . , descriptive norms ) and what others approve of ( i . e . , injunctive norms ) . This result is also in line with prior work on how people often perceive exaggerated norms in various contexts [ 81 , 111 ] . The community’s response to the anti - vaccine content had the most impact on the different types of perceived norms , as well as perceived social tolerance of anti - vaccine behaviors . These results suggest that while frequent sharing of misleading content ( e . g . , anti - vaccine content ) can influence perceptions around a community’s norms , the community’s response can mitigate such effects . For example , in a community wherein people frequently share anti - vaccine content , if other members of the community speak against such content , they can prevent that content from being perceived as normative . Put differently , the reaction of community members to misleading content can prevent the broad impacts of such content on the impressions about the community as a whole . In addition , the effects of the prevalence of certain content and the community members’ response to such content are not limited to influencing perceived norms . The content that members of a community share ( e . g . , anti - vaccine posts ) , and the way other mem - bers respond to it ( e . g . , with support vs . with opposition ) guide expectations around escalated behaviors around the topic . In line with our prior work [ 7 ] , this finding suggests that the activities of community members not only can contribute to the spread of misleading content , they can also have broader impacts at the com - munity level , such as the impressions they give to others about the community as a whole . While prior work suggests that displaying a community’s rules impacts individuals’ behaviors [ e . g . , 82 ] , the results of this study did not support the effects of this intervention on perceptions of the community’s norms . The effects of displaying a community’s rules on the perception of social tolerance of certain behaviors were not supported either . These results could occur for one or both of the following reasons . First , the community’s established rules might be perceived to be set and enforced by the community’s moderators , or even the platform , rather than the community’s members , thus not influencing perceptions of a community’s norms . Future research should investigate the impacts of other ways of conveying a community’s norms . For example , does providing such information using the frame of community’s norms rather than community’s rules make any difference on norms perceptions ? Second , the results could be due to the limitations in the employed experimental design . The study last only for a few minutes , and the participants could possibly have overlooked the presence of the community’s rules during such a short experiment . Explicit statements of rules might only have an effect after extended or repeated exposure . Even though the results of Study 1 did not support the effects of displaying rules on norm perceptions , they reveal evidence sug - gesting that the community’s rules can amplify the effect of the prevalence of content on injunctive and subjective norm perception . When the prevalence of misinformation aligns with community rules against such content , then perceived injunctive and subjective norms are even lower . However , when the prevalence of misin - formation runs contrary to the explicitly stated community rules , participants perceived even higher injunctive and subjective norms about anti - vaccine behaviors . These results suggest that displaying rules is likely to be effective only if they are indeed enforced in the platform as well . What’s the Norm Around Here ? Individuals’ Responses Can Mitigate the Effects of Misinformation Prevalence CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany 4 . 9 Limitations of Study 1 Study 1 has two primary limitations . First , participants’ perceptions of norms are reported based on observing the screenshots of a community for a relatively short period of time . Although studies using screenshots can provide insights into behaviors on social media [ e . g . , 66 ] , this method faces some limitations . For example , this method only allows participants to observe the interactions of others for a short period of time . In addition , it does not allow them to interact with other members of the community . However , people’s perceptions of a community’s norms are formed not only based on observing others’ interactions but also based on their own interactions with others [ 111 ] . In addition , while the screenshot study approach employed in Study 1 provided experimental control to manipulate the elements of the community and examine their impacts on norms , this method offers low ecological validity [ 8 ] . As with any screenshot study , participants may respond differently than when they are actually involved in interactions on a social media site . Second , while study 1 designs items that include escalated be - haviors to measure expectations of escalated behaviors , it is not clear if the participants interpreted the designed items as such . In addition , study 1 does not distinguish between perceived escalated behaviors in online and offline settings . However , people might have different expectations around escalated behaviors in online vs . offline settings . More broadly , perceptions of a community’s norms may differently impact expectations about beliefs and be - haviors within that community vs . beliefs and behaviors beyond that community . For instance , expectations about liking or sharing conspiratorial or other misleading content are essentially expec - tations about how community members will escalate the impact of such content within that community . In contrast , expectations about making donations to an activist organization or showing up to demonstrate at a public rally are essentially expectations about how community members are likely to escalate certain behaviors or views beyond the boundaries of that community . Given that Study 1 did not make this distinction , we do not know whether norms have varying impacts on expectations about escalated behaviors within a community vs . outside the community . 5 Motivations for Study 2 Study 2 improves and expands upon the previous study . Namely , Study 2 provides a more realistic experimental setting , differentiates between expectations about escalated behaviors within an online community and escalated behaviors beyond an online community , and examines how perceptions of norms around one conspiratorial topic ( e . g . , opposition to vaccines ) might influence expectations about beliefs around other conspiratorial topics . 5 . 1 Improvement of Experimental Settings Study 2 provides an improved experimental setting for studying norm perceptions . To do so , it utilizes a simulation - based method , which is successfully used in other experimental research [ e . g . , 44 , 81 , 127 ] . In particular , it uses a social media platform called EatSnap . Love , that is created for conducting controlled experimen - tal research [ 2 ] ( Described in more detail in Section 6 ) . Using this setting , participants can form norm perceptions based on their in - teractions with other users , and during a relatively longer period of time . In addition , this simulation based approach provides a high degree of ecological validity , as reported by prior work [ e . g . , 44 , 81 , 127 ] . Put differently , it goes from participants observing a community , as in Study 1 , to participants directly participating in a community . 5 . 2 Perceived Norms and Perceived Escalated Behaviors Beyond a Community Study 1 demonstrated that norms about conspiratorial behaviors ( such as anti - vaccine content ) can guide expectations about es - calated behavior . However , Study 1 did not differentiate between escalated behaviors within ( e . g . , resharing a post to a broader au - dience ) and outside a community ( e . g . , attending an anti - vaccine demonstration ) . There is no guarantee that norm perception will have the same influence on expectations about escalated behavior outside a community , such as in offline settings , as it does about escalated behaviors within that community . Thus , Study 2 investi - gates this link in more detail , and asks the following questions : RQ2 . c : Do participants’ perceptions of a community’s norms , and / or their perceptions of social tolerance of anti - vaccine behav - iors , guide their expectations of escalated behaviors within the community ? RQ2 . d : Do participants’ perceptions of a community’s norms , and / or their perceptions of social tolerance of anti - vaccine behav - iors , guide their expectations of escalated behaviors outside the community ? 5 . 3 Perceived Norms and Perceived Beliefs in other Conspiracy Theories Above , we suggest that expectations about escalated behaviors online may differ from those offline . In some ways , offline escala - tion represents the participant inferring other behaviors that they have not directly observed as being likely of community mem - bers . Similarly , participants may make inferences about community members’ beliefs based not on direct observation of content about those beliefs , but based on perceived norms around other content . For example , norms of online communities can play an important role on the way community members perceive and respond to conspiracies and related misinformation [ 39 , 102 , 122 ] . Prior work has shown that belief in one conspiracy is predictive of belief in other conspiracy theories [ 54 , 117 , 141 ] . Scheffer et al . [ 117 ] argue that the tendency for dichotomous or black - and - white thinking as one of the reasons that can explain why people who believe in one conspiracy theory can be prone to believe in other conspiracy theories . Thus , if members in a community are perceived as believing in one conspiracy theory , then that perception may increase the expectation that community members similarly believe other con - spiracy theories not directly related . These perceptions can then attract people with pre - existing beliefs in such theories , leading to a homogeneous , like - minded group . The interplay between people’s prior beliefs and the interactions with other people with similar beliefs in such theories can contribute to reinforcing and making CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Zhila Aghajari , Eric P . S . Baumer , and Dominic DiFranzo such beliefs stronger , and can potentially lead to polarization of beliefs [ 112 , 117 ] . Thus , we first ask : RQ3 . a : What elements of an online community ( i . e . , prevalence of anti - vaccine content , the response of other users , and commu - nity’s rules ) influence participants’ expectations around a commu - nity’s beliefs in other conspiracy theories ? We then ask whether different types of norm perceptions and / or social tolerance of anti - vaccine behaviors guide people’s expecta - tions around a community’s beliefs in other conspiracy theories , not directly observed in the community ? RQ3 . b : Do participants’ perceptions of a community’s a ) descrip - tive , b ) injunctive , and c ) subjective norms and / or social tolerance of anti - vaccine behaviors influence their expectations of the com - munity’s beliefs in other conspiracy theories , not directly observed in the community ? 6 Study 2 This section presents Study 2’s methods , including the employed social media site for the experiment ( i . e . , the EatSnap . Love site ) , pro - cedure , participant recruitment , the experimental design , measures to operationalize our key variables , and the data analysis methods , followed by the results and discussion . 6 . 1 EatSnap . Love - Social Media Platform for Experimental Social Media Studies EatSnap . Love is an online web application , which enhances the design and conduction of experimental research related to social media [ 44 ] . This platform was originally created as an “Instagram for food” , and is similar to other popular social networking sites , such as Facebook and Instagram [ 44 ] . The EatSnap . Love platform provides the basic functionality of other popular social media plat - forms . Specifically , the participants are able to sign up , create an account , ( optionally ) fill in their profile information , browse the site and the activities of other users ( e . g . , check their posts , and their comments to others’ posts ) , and check the profile of other users on the site . In addition , the participants can interact with other users by liking and commenting under their posts . This setting on EatSnap . Love achieves a high degree of experimental realism , as reported in prior work [ 81 , 127 ] . In addition to enhancing experimental realism , this experimental setting in EatSnap . Love achieves a high degree of experimental control . In particular , within the EatSnap . Love platform , researchers can simulate social interactions of online users . To do so , all the posts , actors , and interactions on the platform are controlled by the research team . Specifically , the other users that each participant sees and interacts with are all designed bots . This way , in each experimental condition , every participant experiences the same social media experience . Yet , to make the experiment look realistic , the posts are displayed dynamically , and the replies to them also appear dynamically based on a pre - defined schedule . In addition , the programmed bots 3 respond to the participants’ posts after the participants share a post , again based on a pre - defined schedule . These responses are generic and defined by the authors of this 3 The bots that respond to the participant’s posts are not chosen from the actors who are part of the stimuli to avoid introducing any potential , unknown effects . paper ( e . g . , " nice " , " love it ! " ) . However , future research can design conversational - AI that reply back to the particpants’ posts based on the content or their posts , and further improve the experimental realism of this study . In summary , On EatSnap . Love , researchers have the full exper - imental control to design various social media scenarios and test their research questions , while achieving a high degree of experi - mental realism . ( Please check more detail on the implementations of this platform on this Github repository ) . In study 2 , we employed this simulation - based approach to address the limitations of the previous study , and investigate our research questions based on a realistic social media experience . 6 . 2 Procedure The participants were told they were going to help with beta testing a new social network site , called EatSnap . Love , for one day . They were instructed that they would be asked to share their experience with the platform designers once the experiment was over . After consenting to participate , participants completed a pre - survey with demographics . Next , they were randomly assigned into one of the experimental conditions , and given onboarding instructions about the use of the EatSnap . Love website . Participants were asked to log onto the site for a minimum of five minutes at least twice during the experiment and to post content at least once . Participants were sent an email reminder every eight hours about the requirements of the study . At the end of the study , participants were sent a link to a post - study survey , and their account was deactivated . Last , the participants were debriefed about the actual goal of the study . In particular , in the debrief section , we accounted for the ethical concerns discussed in Study1 , Section 4 . 2 . In addition , given that the study involved deceptions about how the other actors on the site were real people , we also informed our participants that all the actors on the site were actually programmed bots designed to post content and reply to other actors’ posts based on a pre - defined program . We described that the purpose of this deception was to ensure that the study was realistic , and resembled an actual social media experiment . This study was approved by the IRB at Lehigh University . 6 . 3 Recruitment and Participants 3204 participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk , from October 2021 to Jun 2022 . Participants were compensated for their time as follows : 50 cents for attending pre - survey , $ 3 for completing the activities on the site , and $ 2 for completing the post - survey . Of 3204 participants who submitted the pre - survey , 1770 created an account on EatSnap . Love website . Among them , 1579 participants attempted the post - survey . This way , of the 3204 number of participants recruited for the study , 1579 participants completed all parts of the study . The attrition rate was therefore 49 . 28 % . After removing the responses where participants did not finish all the steps of the experiment , and the participants who did not pass a simple attention check test , the data of 1096 participants was used for our analysis . Given the small effect size observed in Study 1 , the same priori power analysis used for Study 1 is employed for Study 2 . According to this priori power analysis , we needed a sample What’s the Norm Around Here ? Individuals’ Responses Can Mitigate the Effects of Misinformation Prevalence CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany size of 1093 to detect a small effect ( 𝑓 = 0 . 15 ) with 0 . 95 power . The participants reported a mean age of 37 . 12 ( SD = 10 . 79 ) . Sixty four percent of the participants ( n = 706 ) were female , thirty three percent were male ( n = 365 ) , less than one percent were non - binary ( n = 3 ) , less than one percent of the participants ( n = 4 ) preferred not to disclose their gender , and less than one percent of the participants ( n = 5 ) preferred to self describe their gender . The majority of our sample was white ( 75 . 15 % ) , followed by Black or African American ( 9 . 23 % ) , Hispanic , Latino , or Spanish ( 6 . 69 % ) , Asian ( 5 . 79 % ) , all other races and ethnicity were less than 1 % . The distribution of education among participants was as follows : less than one percent high school incomplete or less , 13 . 86 % high school graduate , 38 . 60 % some college degree , 28 . 92 % four year college degree or bachelor’s degree , 4 . 11 % some post graduate school but not graduate degree , and 14 . 87 % postgraduate or professional degree . Neither gender ( 𝜒 2 = 6 . 94 , 𝑝 = 0 . 803 , nor age ( 𝐹 ( 1288 , 11 ) = 0 . 97 , 𝑝 = 0 . 465 ) , race ( 𝜒 2 = 90 . 19 , p = 0 . 38 ) , and education ( 𝜒 2 = 63 . 11 , p = 0 . 21 ) differed by experimental condition . 6 . 4 Experimental Design Similar to Study 1 , Study 2 also follows a 3 x 2 x 2 between - subjects experimental design . The prevalence of anti - vaccine content are set to 5 % , 30 % , or 60 % of the posts in the experiment depending on the experimental condition . The community response to anti - vaccine content is manipulated to either support or oppose the anti - vaccine posts . The community’s established rules are present or absent depending on the experimental condition as well . However , the experimental setting is designed using a simulation - based approach . Specifically , this study is conducted using a social media site , EatSnap . Love , described in Section 6 . 1 . All the posts , actors , and interactions on the platform are con - trolled by the research team . In particular , similar to the content for the Study 1 , the content of this experiment ( e . g . , posts , comments ) are crafted by the lab members at Social Design Lab at Lehigh University . The control posts are related to every day life ( without being political ) , and the anti - vaccine content is gathered from sev - eral anti - vaccine communities online , as well as from general feel on social media . Once all the posts are created , the research team created comments for the posts . Each post receives 3 to 5 replies , where they are displayed dynamically during the experiment to make the experiment looks live to our participants . 6 . 5 Measures 6 . 5 . 1 Perception of Norms The same scales as in Study 1 were used to measure different types of perceived norms in Study 2 . Responses were solicited on a 7 - point Likert scale ( 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree ) . This scale demonstrated a high degree of reliability for perceived descriptive norms ( 𝛼 = 0 . 97 , 𝑀 = 4 . 76 , 𝑆𝐷 = 0 . 121 ) , injunctive norms ( 𝛼 = 0 . 98 , 𝑀 = 4 . 66 , 𝑆𝐷 = 0 . 08 ) , and subjective norms ( 𝛼 = 0 . 91 , 𝑀 = 3 . 39 , 𝑆𝐷 = 0 . 66 ) . Since this study aims to investigate the mechanisms of perceiving each type of perceived norms , different types of perceived norms are considered as distinct factors in the analysis . 6 . 5 . 2 Perceptions of Social Tolerance To measure perceptions of social tolerance of anti - vaccine behaviors , a two - part scale is de - veloped . The first part includes items identical to the scale used in Study 1 ( 𝛼 = 0 . 85 , 𝑀 = 4 . 77 , 𝑆𝐷 = 0 . 11 ) . The second part displays a post with anti - vaccine content and asks participants’ perceptions about how EatSnap . Love community would tolerate the post ( e . g . , “The majority of people on EatSnap . Love are willing to tolerate this post in their feed . ” ) ( 𝛼 = 0 . 88 , 𝑀 = 4 . 74 , 𝑆𝐷 = 0 . 10 ) . Since these items were correlated strongly ( 𝑟 between 0 . 68 to 0 . 76 ) , we contin - ued our analyses with a single factor to present social tolerance of anti - vaccine behaviors 𝛼 = 0 . 91 , 𝑀 = 4 . 75 , 𝑆𝐷 = 0 . 15 ) ) . 6 . 5 . 3 Expectations of Escalated Behaviors Study 1 found that peo - ple’s perceptions of a community’s norms influence expectations about escalated behaviors . Study 2 intends to separate escalation within the community from escalation outside the community . To do so , we showed people the same posts from Study 1 ( Fig - ure 3 ) . However , to capture expectations around escalated behav - iors within and outside the EatSnap . Love community , we developed two distinct measures , as follows . 6 . 5 . 3 . 1 Expectations of Escalated Behaviors Within the Commu - nity Participants were asked about the likelihood of escalated be - havior online ( e . g . , sharing posts that encourage the spread of an anti - vaccine movement ) ( Figure 3 ) . A six - item scale is used to mea - sure this factor ( e . g . “The majority of people on EatSnap . Love would share this post . ” , “The majority of people on EatSnap . Love would like this post . ” ) ( 𝛼 = 0 . 93 , 𝑀 = 4 . 36 , 𝑆𝐷 = 0 . 083 ) . 6 . 5 . 3 . 2 Expectations of Escalated Behaviors Outside the Commu - nity Participants were asked about the likelihood that EatSnap . love community members take escalated behaviors outside their com - munity ( e . g . , in physical world ) to support anti - vaccine activities . To do so , a six - item scale was developed ( e . g . , “The majority of people on EatSnap . Love are likely to take actions encouraged by this post . ” , “The majority of people on EatSnap . Love are likely to support this cause with their time , their money , or other resources . ” ) . The responses are recorded based on a 7 - point likert scale , ranging from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 7 ( strongly agree ) . The scale shows a high degree of reliability ( 𝛼 = 0 . 93 , 𝑀 = 4 . 11 , 𝑆𝐷 = 0 . 12 ) The expectations about escalated behaviors beyond the commu - nity were still highly correlated to perceptions of escalated behav - iors online ( 𝑟 > 0 . 80 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . However , a motivating question for Study 2 was whether any differences occur between the expec - tations about escalated behaviors within vs . outside a community . Thus , Study 2 still treats these expectations as distinct factors in the analysis . 6 . 5 . 4 Perceived Beliefs in Other Conspiracy Theories Study 1 shows that perceptions of a community’s norms guide people’s perceptions around the community’s behavior regarding escalated behaviors that they have not directly observed in the community . Study 2 aims to examine whether perceived norms can similarly lead to inferring the community’s beliefs regarding content not directly observed in the community . Specifically , it examines whether perceptions of norms around anti - vaccine content result in perceiving beliefs in other conspiracy theories . To do so , participants are shown two posts around two other conspiracy theories around climate change , and the U . S . 2020 presidential election . They are asked about their perceptions around how members of the EatSnap . Love commu - nity would respond to this post using a 6 - item measure ( e . g . , “The majority of people on EatSnap . Love would share this post . ” ) . The CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Zhila Aghajari , Eric P . S . Baumer , and Dominic DiFranzo reliability of responses to both conspiracies posts was high ( i . e . , 𝛼 = 0 . 93 for the conspiracy on climate change , 𝛼 = 0 . 94 for the conspiracy on the election ) . Given that the responses about both these conspiracies were strongly correlated ( r > 0 . 80 ) , and that we had little reason to interrogate separately perceptions about beliefs in different kinds of conspiracy theories , we continued our analysis using a single factor based on the responses . The reliability was high for the single factor scale as well ( 𝛼 = 0 . 92 , 𝑀 = 4 . 82 , 𝑆𝐷 = 0 . 04 ) . 6 . 5 . 5 Satisfaction and Enjoyment The participants’ satisfaction about the use of EatSnap . Love was measured using a single - item ( i . e . , “How satisfied were you using EatSnap . Love ? ” ) . The scale was measured on a 7 - point likert scale , ranging from 1 ( extremely dissatisfied ) to 7 ( extremely satisfied ) ( M = 3 . 297 , SD = 1 . 67 ) . Their enjoyment with EatSnap . Love was measured using a self - developed scale with six items ( e . g . , “I found using EatSnap . Love entertaining” ) . The scale was measured on a 7 - point likert scale , ranging from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 7 ( strongly agree ) , and demonstrated a high degree of reliability ( 𝛼 = 0 . 90 , M = 5 . 17 , SD = 0 . 61 ) . 6 . 5 . 6 Participants Perceptions of Vaccinations Participants were asked about how they think of vaccines and vaccinations using a self - developed , 3 - item scale ( e . g . , “I think vaccines are generally safe . ” , “I think vaccines are generally effective” . ) The responses are recorded based on a 7 - point likert scale , ranging from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 7 ( strongly agree ) . The scale shows a high score of reliability ( 𝛼 = 0 . 89 , 𝑀 = 4 . 60 , 𝑆𝐷 = 0 . 60 ) . 6 . 5 . 7 Participants’ posts The participantsmade atotal of1979 posts on the platform during the experiment . Only 6 of these posts were related to vaccines . Five posts had a pro - vaccine stance , and one post had an ant - vaccine stance . Given the very few vaccine - related posts , and since these posts were scattered across the conditions , we were not able to draw any conclusive conclusions about potential links between our independent variables , and people’s posting behaviors related to vaccines . 6 . 6 Results of Study 2 Similar to Study 1 , Study 2 uses SEM to test the causal relation - ships between the elements of the community , and perceptions of norms and social tolerance of anti - vaccine , as well as broader impressions about the community ( i . e . , expectations of escalated behaviors and beliefs in other conspiracy theories ) . Figure 7 depicts the results of the constructed SEM . The model fitted the data well ( 𝜒 2 ( 717 ) = 4207 . 610 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 , 𝐶𝐹𝐼 = 0 . 93 , 𝑇𝐿𝐼 = 0 . 92 , 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸𝐴 = 0 . 067 , 𝑆𝑅𝑀𝑅 = 0 . 047 ) . This section uses the results of this SEM to test the proposed hypotheses and to investigate the study’s research questions . Similar to Study 1 , and for the reasons mentioned in 4 . 6 , Study 2 examines the potential interaction effects of the manipulated variables on the perceived norms using multivariate analysis of variance ( MANOVA ) . In addition , the details of the interactions are examined using post - hoc Tukey HSD analysis , and reported when significant . Following the approach of reporting the results for Study 1 , this section discusses the results based on the depended variables ( i . e . , perceived norms , perceived social tolerance , expectations of esca - lated behaviors within and outside the community , and expectations of beliefs in other conspiracy theories not stated in the community ) . 6 . 6 . 1 Perceived Descriptive Norms In line with our prediction in H1 . a , prevalence of content with certain behaviors ( i . e . , anti - vaccine content ) had a large , and significant effect on perceived descrip - tive norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 51 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . Tukey’s WSD post - hoc tests demonstrate a significant difference across all levels of posts with anti - vaccine posts ( i . e . , 5 % , 30 % , and 60 % ) . However , the difference in perceived descriptive norms was greater between the condi - tions with 5 % vs . 30 % anti - vaccine posts on the feed , compared to the conditions with 30 % vs . 60 % anti - vaccine posts . These results again suggest that a small occurrence of content that stated certain behaviors ( e . g . , anti - vaccine content ) can provide enough signals for participants to perceive the attitudes as normative . Others’ re - sponse to anti - vaccine content also greatly and significantly influ - ence people’s perceptions of descriptive norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 27 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) ( supporting H2 . a ) . Therefore , the results show that the effects of observing posts with anti - vaccine content on perceived descrip - tive norms was relatively larger compared to the effects of others’ reactions to such content ( B = 0 . 51 vs . B = 0 . 27 , p < 0 . 001 ) . However , given the noticeable role of community members’ responses , they can still mitigate the impacts of the spread of misleading content on perceived descriptive norms . Figure 8a depicts the impacts of the prevalence of content on perceived descriptive norms , and how these impacts are mitigated by the response of community members respond to such content . On the other hand , displaying a community’s rules that forbid posting of misinformation did not have a statistically significant effect on perceived descriptive norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 03 , 𝑝 = 0 . 24 ) ( i . e . , there is not sufficient evidence to support H3 . a ) . The community’s rules did not have any interaction effects with the other manipulated variables of the experiment either . 6 . 6 . 2 Perceived Injunctive Norms Prevalence of posts with anti - vaccine content ( 𝐵 = 0 . 36 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) greatly and significantly influenced people’s perceptions of injunctive norms ( supporting H1 . b ) . Based on Tukey’s WSD post - hoc analysis for SEM , there was a significant difference across all levels of prevalence of posts with anti - vaccine content in the feed . However , the difference of perceived injunctive norms between conditions with 5 % and 30 % anti - vaccine posts was greater than the difference between the conditions with 30 % and 60 % anti - vaccine posts . In addition , the results shows that the way other users respond to anti - vaccine content had a large and significant effect nor perceived injunctive norms as well ( 𝐵 = 0 . 45 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) ( supporting H2 . b ) . In fact , the effects of others’ responses on perceived injunctive norms was relatively larger than the effects of posts with anti - vaccine content ( 𝐵 = 0 . 45 vs . 𝐵 = 0 . 36 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . These results are in line with the definition of injunctive norms ( See Figure 8b ) . In particular , injunctive norms refer to perceptions around what members of a community approve of ( Discussed in more detail in Section 2 . 1 ) . Here , the response of other users to anti - vaccine posts can be a proxy of whether or not the community as a whole would approve or disapprove of the anti - vaccine content . What’s the Norm Around Here ? Individuals’ Responses Can Mitigate the Effects of Misinformation Prevalence CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Figure 7 : The SEM results show that , of the community elements tested , both the prevalence of content and the community’s response to such content had a strong effect on different types of perceived norms , as well as perceptions around social tolerance of anti - vaccine behaviors . These norms perceptions and perceptions around social tolerance in turn lead to broader perceptions about the community , such as expectations about escalated behaviors both within and outside the community , and perceptions of beliefs in other conspiracy theories . ( a ) Descriptive Norms ( b ) Injunctive Norms ( c ) Subjective Norms Figure 8 : The effect of prevalence of anti - vaccine content , and the community members’ response to anti - vaccine posts on perceived A ) descriptive , B ) injunctive , and C ) subjective norms about anti - vaccine behaviors . Greater values indicate perceptions of anti - vaccine beliefs and behaviors as more normative . In contrast with Study 1 , community’s response mitigates , but does not completely eliminate , the effect of prevalence on norm perception . The interaction effects of the prevalence of anti - vaccine content and the community’s response to such content on perceived in - junctive norms was small , yet statistically significant ( 𝐹 ( 1089 , 2 ) = 5 . 39 , 𝑝 < 0 . 01 ) . A post - hoc Tukey HSD test shows that when the community members respond to anti - vaccine content via opposing comments ( i . e . , comments with a pro - vaccine stance ) , they can mit - igate the effects of such content on the perceived injunctive norms . For example , the results show that when the anti - vaccine content constitutes 60 % of the posts on the feed , but the community mem - bers respond to such content with opposition in the comments , the participants on average reported lower perceived injunctive norms CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Zhila Aghajari , Eric P . S . Baumer , and Dominic DiFranzo compared to when these posts are less prevalence ( i . e . , constitute 30 % of the posts ) yet supported by the community members in comments ( M = 4 . 40 vs . M = 5 . 59 , p < 0 . 001 ) . The effect of displaying community’s rules on perceived injunc - tive norms was neither large nor statistically significant ( i . e . , there is not sufficient evidence to support H3 . b ) . The community’s rules did not have any interaction effects with the other manipulated variables of the experiment either . 6 . 6 . 3 Perceived Subjective Norms Prevalence of posts with anti - vaccine content ( 𝐵 = 0 . 32 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) , as well as the way other members of the EatSnap . Love community responds to such content ( 𝐵 = 0 . 28 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) greatly and significantly influenced people’s perceptions of subjective norms ( supporting H1 . c and H2 . c ) ( See Figure 8c ) . The interaction effects of the prevalence of anti - vaccine content and the response of the community to such content were small , yet statistically significant ( 𝐹 ( 1089 , 2 ) = 4 . 49 , 𝑝 < 0 . 05 ) . In particular , the results show that the community’s response to anti - vaccine content , if opposing such content , can mitigate the effects of the prevalence of anti - vaccine content . For example , in the con - dition wherein 60 % of the posts exhibit anti - vaccine content but the community oppose such content in the response , the participants on average reported lower perceived subjective norms compared to when 30 % of the posts exhibited anti - vaccine content but the content was supported in the community’s response ( M = 2 . 76 vs . M = 3 . 23 , p < 0 . 001 ) However , displaying community norms did not have a statisti - callysignificanteffecton perceived subjectivenorms ( 𝐵 = − 0 . 009 , 𝑝 = 0 . 83 ) ( i . e . , there is not sufficient evidence to support H3 . c ) . The com - munity’s rules did not have any interaction effects with the other manipulated variables of the experiment either . 6 . 6 . 4 Perceived Social Tolerance In response to RQ1 . a , prevalence of posts with anti - vaccine content had a very small , yet significant effect on perceived social tolerance of anti - vaccine content ( B = 0 . 07 p < 0 . 005 ) . The effects of the response of other users to such content on social tolerance of anti - vaccine behavior were also significant , but relatively larger ( 𝐵 = 0 . 11 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . To investigate RQ1 . b , the constructed SEM includes a regres - sion model that explores the effects of different perceived norms on perceptions of social tolerance of anti - vaccine attitudes . Per - ceived injunctive norms most strongly and significantly predict social tolerance of anti - vaccine behaviors ( 𝐵 = 0 . 81 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . Perceived descriptive ( 𝐵 = 0 . 11 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) and subjective norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 10 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) both had small , yet significant effects on perceived social tolerance as well . 6 . 6 . 5 Expectations of Escalated Behaviors Within the Community In response to RQ2 . c , people’s perceptions of descriptive norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 10 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) , subjective norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 07 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) , as well as their perceptions of social tolerance ( 𝐵 = 0 . 75 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) influenced expectations around escalated behaviors within the community . In particular , perceived social tolerance of anti - vaccine behaviors most strongly predicted expectations around escalated behaviors within the community . None of the elements of the community ( i . e . , the prevalence of anti - vaccine posts , other responses of other users to such content , and the community’s rules ) directly and significantly predicted participants’ expectations around escalated behaviors within the community . 6 . 6 . 6 Expectations of Escalated Behaviors Outside the Community With respect to RQ2 . d , perceived subjective norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 17 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) had a significant effect on perceptions of escalated behav - iors offline . Perceptions of social tolerance , however , had a greater impact on expectations of escalated behaviors outside the commu - nity ( 𝐵 = 0 . 59 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . As discussed in Section 6 . 6 . 5 , perceived social tolerance most strongly influenced perceptions of escalated behaviors within the community as well . Among the elements of the community , only the response of other users to anti - vaccine content directly and significantly influ - enced perceptions of escalated behaviors outside the community . However , the effect of this element was very small ( 𝐵 = 0 . 07 , 𝑝 < 0 . 05 ) . 6 . 6 . 7 Expectations of Beliefs in other Conspiracy Theories None of the manipulated elements of the community ( i . e . , the prevalence of content that exhibits certain behaviors , the response of other members to such content , and the community’s established rules ) had neither a large nor statistically significant effect on expectations around the community’s beliefs in other conspiracy theories that were not directly stated in the community ( responding to RQ3 . a ) . However , in response to RQ3 . b , perceived descriptive norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 08 , 𝑝 < 0 . 05 ) , perceived subjective norms ( 𝐵 = 0 . 21 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) , and perceived social tolerance ( 𝐵 = 0 . 57 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) of anti - vaccine behaviors significantly predicted perceptions of beliefs in other conspiracy theories . As repeatedly observed for other perceptions about the community , people’s perceptions of social tolerance had the strongest effect on expectations around the community’s beliefs in other conspiracy theories not directly stated in the community as well . Participants’ opinions on the safety and efficacy of vaccination had a small , yet significant effect on perceptions of descriptive norms . Specifically , participants who reported higher trust in vac - cines’ safety and efficacy on average reported slightly higher per - ceived descriptive norms of anti - vaccines ( 𝑀 = 4 . 624 vs . 𝑀 = 4 . 383 ) . However , this factor did not affect perceptions around any other types of norms , social tolerance , or escalated behaviors . These results may be partially because of the small variation in the partic - ipants’ reported opinions on the safety and efficacy of vaccination ( 𝑀 = 4 . 60 , 𝑆𝐷 = 0 . 60 ) . Future work can clarify the potential effects of opinions about vaccinations on perceptions of norms around vaccines . In addition , none of the study’s outcome variables varied based on participant demographics . 6 . 7 Discussion of Study 2 The results of study 2 confirm the effects of the prevalence of anti - vaccine content on perceptions of norms around anti - vaccine behaviors . Specifically , the frequent sharing of anti - vaccine content had the most effects on perceptions around what others do ( i . e . , descriptive norms ) and how they expect the rest of the community to behave ( i . e . , subjective norms ) regarding anti - vaccine behaviors . In line with the findings of Study 1 , the results also demonstrate that the response of the community members to anti - vaccine con - tent has a relatively greater effect than the effect of the content What’s the Norm Around Here ? Individuals’ Responses Can Mitigate the Effects of Misinformation Prevalence CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany itself on perceptions around what the community approves of ( i . e . , injunctive norm perceptions ) and what the community is willing to tolerate ( i . e . , social tolerance ) . These results connote the significant role that community members can play in mitigating the impacts of the prevalence of conspiratorial content on impressions about the community as a whole . However , while displaying a commu - nity’s rules might influence individuals’ behaviors [ e . g . , 82 ] , in our results , once again we did not observe the effects of this interven - tion on perceptions about a community’s norms . As discussed in Section 4 . 8 , the community’s rules might appear to be established by the moderators or platform rather than by its members . Future work should investigate the impacts of other ways of communicat - ing a community’s rules . In addition , it is possible that the presence of rules around misinformation in our experiment have not been salient enough . In particular , given that the rules about misinfor - mation are displayed in conjunction with other community’s rules ( e . g . , rules around respectful interactions ) , their presence may not be as noticeable to our participants . Future work should investigate the impacts of other ways of communicating a community’s rules . In line with study 1 , study 2 acknowledges that the prevalence of misleading content shared in a community , and the response of other members to such content do not only impact perceptions of norms . Through their impacts on perceived norms , these elements of a community contribute to the broader impressions about the community . For example , perceived norms around conspiratorial content ( e . g . , anti - vaccine content ) impact perceptions of social tolerance of opinions and behaviors stated in the content . These perceptions can in turn impact both individuals and online com - munities . For example , perceiving conspiracies theories as socially tolerated can contribute to expanding their reach . It can also have consequences at the community level , such as influencing impres - sions taken by outsiders about the community , impacting who joins the community and how they choose to behave In addition , perceived norms of a community guide broader im - pressions that individuals form about a community . For example , this study demonstrates that perceived norms of anti - vaccine behav - iors impact expectations around escalated behaviors , both within and outside the community . Moreover , perceived norms around one conspiracy theory can guide expectations around conspirato - rial thinking in the community . At least two possible explanations could account for this effect . First , many conspiracy theories are based on a broad distrust in science [ 14 , 45 , 94 , 100 ] . Perceiving one such anti - scientific conspiracy ( here , opposition to vaccines ) as popular in a community may lead to perceptions of belief in other conspiracy theories founded on a distrust of science . Second , conspiracy theories more generally involve certain psychological similarities . They tend to be fairly speculative , to involve significant complexity , to provide a sense of control over uncertainty , etc . [ 46 ] . Thus , participants who perceived a community as believing in one conspiracy theory may view that belief as stemming from under - lying cognitive proclivities that make community members more likely to believe in other conspiracy theories . 7 Broader Implications The combined results from Study 1 and Study 2 did not support our hypothesis that making a community’s rules explicit impact per - ceptions of norms . However , both the prevalence of certain content ( e . g . , anti - vaccine posts ) shared by the members of a community and the response of other members to such content do contribute to the perceptions of a community’s norms . In addition , the results show how perceived norms can have broader impacts , including influenc - ing perceptions around social tolerance of conspiratorial content , guiding expectations about escalated behaviors both within and outside the community , and shaping impressions about community members’ beliefs around other conspiratorial topics not directly exhibited within the community . The remainder of this section considers how our findings offer implications , not only in terms of designing platforms for online communities but also in terms of community policies and governance . 7 . 1 Implications for Designing Platforms for Online Communities Although the prevalence of content influences perceptions about a community’s norms , the community’s response to such content impacts perceived norms as well . Indeed , the response of commu - nity members to such content can have an even more substantial impact on perceptions around what the community approves of and what it will tolerate . Thus , with their responses , community members can mitigate some of the impacts of misleading content on perceptions about the community . Therefore , the response of community members to misleading content not only can have indi - vidual level impacts ( e . g . , influence people’s view of and responses to the immediate issues ) [ 37 ] , it can also address some of the com - munity level impacts of misleading content , such as its effects on perceptions about a community . These findings suggest the impor - tance of foregrounding the way members of a community respond to different content , especially in the case of conspiratorial content and related misinformation . Platform designers and academic researchers can thus consider design solutions that spotlight responses from the community mem - bers . For example , instead of relying only on highlighting the num - bers of downvotes or question marks to misleading pieces of con - tent [ e . g . , 20 ] , future research could investigate the impacts of high - lighting the authentic comments from the community members . Could such highlighting influence perceived norms ? Future work can also examine designing interventions that encourage people to join this effort of addressing misleading content . Such interventions might , for instance , ask a user whether there is information in a given post that the user believes should be corrected for other com - munity members . Doing so via selective notifications could provide just - in - time responses to misinformation , not from an automated fact checker but from other human community members . Indeed , these community - oriented interventions should be designed in a way to ensure that the involvement of the community members is effective and will not result in disrupting the community and its interactions . Similar to unintended side effects of some content moderation practices [ e . g . , 49 ] , community - oriented approaches can potentially result in deleterious effects as well . For example , if not provided with proper guidance , some people may attempt to CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Zhila Aghajari , Eric P . S . Baumer , and Dominic DiFranzo correct misinformation using uncivil comments [ 80 ] . Not only are such involvements less favorable [ 80 ] and less effective [ 36 , 118 ] , they can even negatively impact perceptions of norms around toxic conversations . In addition , the proposed community - generated re - sponses can potentially be effective in situations wherein there are agreed - upon facts ( e . g . , scientific topics , such as climate change , and vaccines ) . However , there exist cases where there is no clear objective truth [ 42 , 142 ] . For example , discussions around religious issues , or cultures , are not objective , but subjective and dependent on social constructs , which vary from one culture to another , and / or from one religion to another [ 42 ] . In addition , there are situations of uncertainty , for example just after a sudden , shocking event takes place ( e . g . , the Boston Marathon bombing ) , where there are no verifiable facts about the event , thus no one still knows the truth . In such cases , promoting community - centered may result in privi - leging certain points of view over others . Thus , future researchers should consider carefully such possible side effects when designing community - oriented interventions . In addition , users could be prompted about the damages of mis - leading content on their community as a whole . Users could be told that the goal in responding to such content is not necessar - ily to correct the individual person who posted the misinforma - tion but rather to ensure that others are not misled by it . In fact , such policies could be established explicitly in community rules or governance procedures . Put differently , just as researchers should consider community - level effects and interventions , so , too , should community members be encouraged to think about the effects of misinformation and their responses to it at the community level . 7 . 2 Implications for Designing Policies and Governance for Online Communities While prior work suggests that displaying explicit community rules can impact individuals’ behaviors [ e . g . , 82 ] , our results did not support the direct effects of this intervention on perceptions about community norms . Indeed , these results do not imply that online communities should abandon explicitly displaying their rules . However , it suggests that displaying rules may not fully address the broader impacts of misleading content in terms of impressions about the behaviors and opinions of a community . Thus , online community leaders can expect explicit posting of rules to influence some behaviors , but if they want to shape perceptions about a community’s norms , they will likely need to pursue other strategies . The prevalence of certain types of content shared in a com - munity , however , strongly impacts what people perceive as norma - tive within a community . For example , when anti - vaccine posts are shared frequently , the behavior exhibited in the content can influ - ence perceptions about what people of a community do and believe in ( i . e . , descriptive norms ) , what they approve of ( i . e . , injunctive norms ) , and what they expect others to do regarding vaccinations ( i . e . , subjective norms ) . In addition , the impacts of content are not limited to only influencing perceived norms regarding the immedi - ate , observed topic ( e . g . , anti - vaccine views ) . The frequent sharing of content with certain behaviors impacts perceived norms , through which it contributes to the broader perceptions about the commu - nity as a whole ( e . g . , how the community as a whole tolerates anti - vaccine behavior , the community’s beliefs in other conspiracy theories ) . Therefore , the findings suggest that to address the broader im - pacts of conspiratorial topics and related misinformation , social media companies , as well as community moderators and adminis - trators , still need to account for the role of misleading content . Put differently , addressing misleading content is not only required to ad - dress the spread of misleading content on individuals but also vital for addressing the broader impacts of misleading content at com - munity level ( e . g . , perceptions about normative behaviors within an online community ) . Therefore , while we do need to move towards community - oriented aspects of misleading content , as suggested by prior work [ 7 ] , we should not abandon approaches that address individual pieces of content or the individual actors involved in its spread . 8 Limitations and Future Work Directions This work has two primary limitations , which both suggest impor - tant directions for future work . First , our experiment examines the role of prevalence of content and community response to it in a ho - mogeneous setting . Specifically , the vaccine related content in our experiments only exhibits anti - vaccine attitudes . However , in real world scenarios , online communities are often heterogeneous in terms of views on vaccinations . That is , people might share content with different stances towards vaccines ( i . e . , pro - vaccine and anti - vaccine content ) . For example , when people encounter posts with anti - vaccine stance , they might in response share counter - argument content that disputes such misleading posts and / or provides addi - tional information about vaccines’ safety and efficacy . Observing such pro - vaccine content shared by members of a community is likely to signal what the community approves of , and mitigate the impacts of conspiratorial content on norm perceptions . Therefore , future work is encouraged to investigate how the interplay between the prevalence of pro - vaccine and anti - vaccine content impact per - ceived norms in heterogeneous environments . Such settings also allow future work to explore whether and how the community’s re - sponse to vaccine related content in a heterogeneous environment might impact perceived norms around vaccines . In addition , we restricted the community’s response to anti - vaccine content to be either all supporting or all opposing anti - vaccinecontent . Wemadethisdesignchoice tohelpexplore whether or not community response has any effects on norm perceptions in the first place . Uniform agreement or disagreement was an effec - tive way to test that . However , we acknowledge that in real world scenarios , there is often a mixture of supportive and opposing com - ments to conspiratorial content . In addition , there are more nuanced discussions around conspiracy theories , such as anti - vaccine con - tent , broader than expressions of agreements and disagreements . Thus , future work can make valuable contributions by exploring the effects of such nuances in community response in heterogeneous environments . Second , regarding explicit community rules , this work investi - gates the direct effects of displaying explicit community rules on perceived norms . While the results do not support the direct effects of displaying the community’s rules on perceived norms , this inter - vention may still impact perceived norms via impacting individuals’ What’s the Norm Around Here ? Individuals’ Responses Can Mitigate the Effects of Misinformation Prevalence CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany behaviors . Put differently , the impacts of rules on norms percep - tions can occur via a two - step process . Initially , the community’s rules can impact individuals’ behaviors [ e . g . , 82 ] . Consequently , the behaviors of individuals , even a minority of a community’s members as seen in the results , can impact perceived norms . Future work is encouraged to explore such processes by which displaying the community’s rules may impact perceived norms . In addition , the effects of community rules are explored in a homogeneous environment in terms of opinions related to vaccines . That is , in our experiments , all the vaccine - related posts have anti - vaccine stances , and the community responses to those posts all have either pro - vaccine or anti - vaccine stance . However , as discussed above , in real world scenarios people might be exposed to various stances toward vaccines . Future work can also examine the effects of dis - playing community rules on perceived norms in a heterogeneous environment in terms of stances toward vaccines . Also , the conducted studies examined only one way of providing information on community’s established expectations , i . e . , via dis - playing explicit community rules , to manipulate perceived norms . Future work can examine the impacts of other ways of convey - ing community norms . For example , does providing information using the frame of community’s norms rather than community’s rules impact perceived norms ? In addition , does highlighting the community - level concerns about the impacts of misleading content ( e . g . , protecting their community and its image ) influence percep - tions around the community’s norms ? Future work is encouraged to investigate these questions to manipulate perceptions of the norms of a community , and the broader impacts norm perceptions have on online communities . Furthermore , the paper suggests two important research direc - tions , which , while outside the scope of this work , are valuable for future work to explore . In both studies , we only tested three different fixed proportions of anti - vaccine posts ( i . e . , 5 % , 30 % , and 60 % of the posts on the feed ) . This approach was motivated by prior work on norms perceptions in other contexts [ 81 ] . Both studies demonstrate that observing a minority of anti - vaccine posts ( i . e . , 30 % ) in the feed led people to perceive the behavior stated in the posts as normative . However , this design prevents us from know - ing the exact proportion at which anti - vaccine content would be perceived as normative . Future work could examine whether there is a tipping point , as observed in other contexts [ 27 , 96 ] , where a minority of the content that states conspiratorial beliefs reaches a critical mass and is perceived as normative . The exact proportion at which that tipping point occurs may vary due to factors such as the affordances of the platform , the type of conspiratorial content , and the viewer’s familiarity with the community , among others . Thus , rather than exhaustively testing different proportions of conspira - torial content , future work can investigate the contexts in which such a tipping point occurs and if it is often significantly less than the majority of content ( i . e . , 51 % ) . In addition , in our experimental studies , the participants did not have membership in the EatSnap . Love community for more than the duration of the experiment . Prior work shows that salience of membership [ 67 ] , needs to belong [ 23 ] , among other factors , may impact the mechanisms of norms perceptions . The experimental settings in our experiments , however , do not allow us to explore the effects of such factors on norms perceptions . Future work , perhaps using an observational study , can examine the potential effects of such factors on the mechanisms by which norms around conspiracy theories and related misinformation are perceived in an online community . 9 Conclusion Perceptions about a community’s norms influence impressions about the behaviors and opinions of the community regarding con - spiracy theories and related misinformation . This paper identifies some of the mechanisms by which people perceive norms of online communities around these topics . It reveals that frequent sharing of misleading content in a community , even when constituting a minority of posts in the community , impacts different types of perceived norms ( i . e . , descriptive , injunctive , and subjective norms ) . However , the community’s response to such content can play a great role , sometimes even a greater role than the role of content , thus mitigating the impacts of misleading content on perceptions about normative behaviors . On the other hand , our results did not support the effects of displaying a community’s rules on perceptions of the norms of an online community . This paper also examined some of the broader impacts of per - ceived norms . It demonstrates that perceptions of norms around one conspiracy theory lead to perceptions around social tolerance of conspiratorial content ; expectations about escalated behaviors , both within and outside the community ; and community members’ beliefs around other conspiratorial topics not directly stated within the community . These effects have a variety of broader impacts on online communities . For example , these perceptions can influ - ence how community members perceive their own community , thus guiding the way people make sense of different events and respond to them . In addition , these perceptions also influence how outsiders perceive the community thereby influencing who joins the community and how they choose to behave . Thisresearchunderscorestheimportanceofcommunity - oriented interventions to address the impacts of conspiratorial content on perceptions about a community . It offers specific guidance , both for future researchers and for platform designers to investigate strategies that are likely to affect perceptions of online communi - ties . For example , to address the effects of misleading content on the perceived norms of a community , future research can examine the impacts of highlighting the responses of members who aim to debunk misleading content and / or disapprove of it . In addition , future research can design interventions to prompt community members to join this effort , thereby protecting their community and its image . To reiterate , the behaviors of online communities ( e . g . , the con - tent they share , and the way they respond to the content shared by others ) can influence perceived norms . Perceptions of norms then lead to broader impressions about the community and guide ex - pectations about the community’s behaviors and beliefs regarding other issues . Therefore , in line with our prior work [ 7 ] , this work once again acknowledges the need to account for the community - oriented interventions to address the broader , community - level impacts of misleading content .
