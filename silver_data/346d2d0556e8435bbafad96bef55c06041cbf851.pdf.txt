In addition , the error attributed to using relatively few observation sites to estimate global averaged MCF has become smaller . The differences in MCF concentra - tion gradients between measurement sites are now one - fourth the size of those in the 1980s and early 1990s . Montzka et al . also found a small OH IAV when they analyzed several other gases primarily oxidized by OH . OH is involved in tropospheric oxida - tion processes ( see the ﬁ gure ) that inﬂ uence pollutants and greenhouse gases , includ - ing nitrogen dioxide ( NO 2 ) , carbon monox - ide ( CO ) , sulfur dioxide ( SO 2 ) , ozone ( O 3 ) , hydrochlorofluorocarbons ( HCFCs ) , and CH 4 . These reactions drive three major pro - cesses . First , in “source reactions , ” O 3 mol - ecules are broken down by photons and inter - act with water vapor to form OH . Second , in “loss reactions , ” OH is removed , although some recycling of OH can occur . In reactions with CO and CH 4 , there is also a feedback loop that enhances the loss of OH . Finally , there are reactions in which OH destroys pol - lutants and greenhouse gases , with OH levels remaining relatively unchanged . Of particular interest is the role that OH may play in the recent trends and year - to - year variation of CH 4 ( 8 , 9 ) . Changes in methane may originate either from changes in emissions or from changes in its rate of loss , mainly through reactions with OH . To understand the role played by OH vari - ability , however , it is extremely important to know whether OH IAV is just a few per - cent , as indicated by Montzka et al . and by model studies ( 2 – 5 ) , or is up to 10 % or 20 % , as indicated by past analyses ( 6 , 7 ) , includ - ing studies that measured carbon isotopes ( 14 CO ) ( 10 ) . There are considerable uncer - tainties in the models , and they can vary by a factor of 2 in the calculated lifetime of meth - ane because of reaction with OH ( 11 , 12 ) . Although the accuracy of the MCF and 14 CO meth - ods has been questioned ( 13 , 14 ) , the much larger IAV in past MCF and 14 CO studies prompted discus - sion of the lack of a the - oretical understanding of the OH budget . Now , Montzka et al . ’s ﬁ ndings support several past model studies ( 2 – 5 ) and indicate that global OH is quite stable . It could be that increased OH forma - tion by nitrogen oxides ( 5 ) compensated for depletion of OH by reactive carbon gases . In the future , human - induced pollution and climate change could lead to substantial changes in the OH budget if they alter some of the central processes that involve OH . To bet - ter understand these issues , investigators need models that have higher resolution , include interactive coupling with biospheric processes and climate change , and draw on improved emission inventories . Observational networks of pollutants and climate compounds should include more stations to get better global cov - erage , and funding is required to secure long - term data series . As the concentration of MCF approaches zero , perhaps the most useful tool for estimating global OH will disappear . The possibility of producing and releasing dedicated “tracer” gases ( 2 ) to replace MCF should be investigated . References 1 . S . Montzka et al . , Science 331 , 67 ( 2011 ) . 2 . J .

In the troposphere , the hydroxyl radical ( OH ) is involved in reactions that affect pollutants and greenhouse gases . Reactions result in OH production ( blue ) , recycling ( green ) , or loss ( red ) . For CO and the greenhouse gas CH 4 , a feedback loop ( dashed red arrows ) enhances the OH loss . OH also destroys pollutants and greenhouse gases ( gray ) , with OH levels remaining relatively unchanged . MCF ( CH 3 CCl 3 , light blue ) is destroyed through reactions with OH . 10 . 1126 / science . 1199773 Formin Tip Tracking CELL BIOLOGY Thomas D . Pollard A simple protein machine tracks the tip of a growing actin ﬁ lament . E ukaryotic cells , including those of humans , depend on ﬁ laments of actin protein for their physical integrity and movements . Formins are a class of pro - teins that regulate actin assembly , produc - ing ﬁ laments that participate in cell divi - sion , cell migration , and intracellular trans - port , among other cellular processes ( 1 ) . Although many proteins have been iden - tified that regulate actin , we need to bet - ter understand their modes of action at the molecular level . Technical advances , such as single - molecule imaging in real time with puriﬁ ed proteins and in live cells , are extending this knowledge . On page 80 of this issue , Mizuno et al . ( 2 ) present a method for visualizing the rotational movement of actin ﬁ laments as they grow from immobi - lized formin proteins . The study conﬁ rms that actin elongation is coupled to rotation motion of the ﬁ lament , and provides clues about how formins might transmit actin - generated force to other cellular structures . Formin proteins exist as dimers through the interaction of their homology 2 ( FH2 ) domain . The dimer of FH2 domains initiates the polymerization of a new actin ﬁ lament and then remains bound to the fast - growing end ( known as the barbed end ) of the ﬁ la - ment as it elongates ( 3 , 4 ) . Remarkably , as each new actin molecule associates with the ﬁ lament , the formin dimer moves reliably onto a new elongated end ( see the ﬁ gure ) .

Consequently , a formin anchored to a structure in the cell can send out an actin ﬁ lament to explore the surrounding cyto - plasm . In one well - studied example in bud - ding yeast , these ﬁ laments grow at a rate of 100 subunits per second , or 0 . 27 µ m / s ( 5 ) . Because actin subunits in a ﬁ lament are arranged in a helix , and given speciﬁ c inter - actions between the donut - shaped dimer of formin FH2 domains with the end of the ﬁ la - ment ( 6 ) , one expects the formin to follow a helical path as the polymer grows . According to this view , if the ﬁ lament were anchored , the formin would rotate , or if the formin were anchored , the ﬁ lament would rotate . However , when the distal end of a ﬁ lament and the for - min on the growing end were both attached to a glass microscope slide , actin polymeriza - tion produced enough force to buckle the ﬁ la - ment but , contrary to expectations , the doubly tethered ﬁ lament did not twist into a super - coil , as expected if the formin tracked along the growing helix ( 7 ) . Two hypotheses were proposed to explain this “rotation paradox” ( 8 ) : Torque might cause the formin to slip around the end of the ﬁ lament , or the connec - tion of the formin to the slide might rotate . Mizuno et al . observed an actin ﬁ lament growing from a formin that was attached to a microscope slide by antibody mole - cules . Their innovation was to label just a few of the actin molecules in the ﬁ lament with a ﬂ uorescent dye and to observe the ﬁ laments with polarized light . By exciting the dye molecules with polarized light and observing the emitted ﬂ uorescence through a polarizer , only those subunits in the ﬁ la - ment with a favorably oriented dye were visible . The authors observed that the ﬂ uo - rescence appeared and disappeared every time the ﬁ lament underwent half a rotation , showing that the ﬁ lament rotates relative to the immobilized formin on the end , exactly as predicted if the formin tracks along the growing helical polymer . Mizuno et al . also conﬁ rmed that the ﬁ lament does not rotate when both the growing end ( with the for - min ) and the distal end of the ﬁ lament are immobilized . This supports the idea that the slippage is between the formin and the slide , but does not rule out slippage between the formin and the ﬁ lament . In addition to initiating ﬁ lament forma - tion and tracking processively on the fast - growing end , formins also allow actin poly - mers to break the diffusion speed limit as they polymerize . Biophysical experiments established long ago that the rate of elonga - tion is determined by the frequency of col - lisions of diffusing actin molecules with the end of the ﬁ lament , with about 2 % of the collisions resulting in incorporation of a new subunit into the ﬁ lament . Remark - ably , the FH1 domain of a formin allows ﬁ laments to grow at rates that exceed this diffusion limit by a factor of 2 to 5 ( 9 ) . The ﬂ exible FH1 domain is positioned next to the FH2 domain and , like a tentacle , binds to the protein proﬁ lin , which brings along a molecule of actin . Binding of proﬁ lin - actin to the FH1 domain is rate - limiting because the actin subunit is transferred very rapidly onto the end of the filament . These reac - tions provide more sites for diffusion to pro - vide subunits to grow the ﬁ lament . Mizuno et al . show that ﬁ laments elongating by the FH1 - proﬁ lin pathway rotate as they track the actin ﬁ lament helix . Mizuno et al . use their new assay to con - ﬁ rm that hydrolysis of adenosine 5 ′ - triphos - phate ( ATP ) bound to actin is not required for formins to mediate elongation of actin ﬁ laments , but they ﬁ nd that the nucleotide bound to the actin subunits inﬂ uences both polymerization and depolymerization . After assembly , each actin subunit quickly hydro - lyzes its bound ATP to ADP ( adenosine 5 ′ - diphosphate ) and phosphate , followed by slow dissociation of the phosphate . Mizuno et al . show that formin - mediated elongation reactions are reversible . The FH2 domain tracks along the actin helix of shortening ﬁ laments of ADP - actin subunits and pro - ﬁ lin promotes this process , but not if the γ - phosphate of ATP remains bound to the subunits . Thus , in principle , a shortening actin ﬁ lament might be able to produce force on a processively associated formin and any attached cargo . Formidable challenges remain . One for the biophysicists is to characterize the mechanics that allow formin FH2 domains to track processively on the end of a grow - Actin elongation pathway Profilin - actin elongation pathway Actin monomer binds to filament end FH2 domain steps onto new terminal actin subunit and filament rotates FH2 domain steps onto new terminal actin subunits and filament rotates Profilin - actin transfers rapidly to filament end Actin filament Formin FH2 domain Formin FH1 domain GST dimer anchored to slide Profilin - actin Profilin - actin binds FH1 A B Actin ﬁ lament enlongation . ( A ) Actin can be added to the end of a ﬁ lament from the bulk phase . ( B ) A proﬁ lin - actin complex can bind to one of multiple sites ( purple ) in the ﬂ exible FH1 domain of formin and then transfer rapidly onto the end of the ﬁ lament . In both cases , the dimeric FH2 domain of formin steps reli - ably onto the new actin subunit . When formin is anchored ( 2 ) , the ﬁ lament rotates as the FH2 domain tracks along the elongating helical ﬁ lament . GST , glutathione S - transferase . C RE D I T : Y .

Another is to determine how bundles of cross - linked ﬁ laments elongate from formin attached to cellular structures . Formins have well - established distinct roles in fungi ( 3 ) , but cell biologists must sort out the overlapping functions of more than a dozen formins in human cells . References 1 . T . D .

A few years ago , a new type of large - scale laser infrastructure specifi - cally conceived to produce the high - est peak power and focused intensity was announced : the Extreme Light Infrastructure , ELI ( 1 ) , designed to be the ﬁ rst exawatt - class ( 10 18 W ) laser . This gargantuan power will be obtained by cramming a kilojoule of energy into a pulse only 10 fs in duration . Analysis of the history of laser development reveals that the pulse duration and intensity of lasers ( or derived coherent radiation bursts ) are linearly related over more than 18 orders of magni - tude ( see the ﬁ gure ) . This observation leads us to the conclusion that the shortest coherent pulse should come from such a large - sized laser . If zeptosecond and perhaps yoctosec - ond pulses can be produced using kilojoule - megajoule systems , it would open a route to time - resolved nuclear physics exploration and the possibility of peeking into the nucleus interior in the same way that chemical reac - tions or atoms can be probed today . The motivation underpinning the push toward such extreme power ( 2 ) is not only ultrahigh laser intensity and the associated ﬁ eld that could be attained , but also the pros - pect of producing exceedingly short bursts of energetic radiation and particles . Since the ﬁ rst laser demonstrated by Maiman in 1960 ( 3 ) that operated with kilowatt - scale peak powers and internal intensity in the kW cm – 2 range with an overall pulse duration in the microsecond regime , the continual devel - opments in laser design have produced peak intensities exceeding 1 TW cm – 2 with pulses 10 fs or shorter ( 4 – 6 ) . At this point , the pulse bandwidth for the broadest bandwidth ampli - fying material , Ti : sapphire . Shorter pulses need to acquire a broader spectrum before they can be recompressed . This is accomplished in a gas - filled hol - low fiber ( 7 ) that can achieve the single - wavelength limit of 2 . 6 fs for 800 nm . To go to even shorter than one light period , higher frequencies must be generated . This is done by high harmonic generation ( 8 ) in a gas jet . The laser intensity is increased by focus - ing the compressed pulse beam after the ﬁ ber and the compressor . A fraction of the harmonic spectrum is selected to produce pulses down to 0 . 08 fs ( 9 ) . If we want to obtain even shorter pulses , we need to resort to even higher intensities , leave the nonlinear bound electron regime , and enter the high - energy relativistic regime , which is greater than 10 18 W cm – 2 for a wave - length of 1 µ m . In this relativistic regime , the strength of the laser ﬁ eld propels the electrons to such high speeds that their “mass” changes as they oscillate . A laser pulse producing this intensity will make the target surface elec - trons oscillate in and out at relativistic veloc - ity . As a consequence , any light hitting this oscillating mirror is modulated periodically , resulting in the generation of high harmon - ics ( 10 , 11 ) . Relativistic high harmonic gen - eration gives the prospect of a much broader 1 Institut Lumiere Extreme , ENSTA , Chemin de la Huniere , 91128 Palaiseau , France . 2 Faculty of Physics , Ludwig - Maximillians - Universität München , 85748 Garching , Ger - many .
