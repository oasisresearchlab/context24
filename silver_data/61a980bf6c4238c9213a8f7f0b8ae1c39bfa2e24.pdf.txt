In polarized cells , signal transduction by cholera toxin ( CT ) requires apical endocytosis and ret - rograde transport into Golgi cisternae and perhaps ER ( Lencer , W . I . , C . Constable , S . Moe , M . Jobling , H . M . Webb , S . Ruston , J . L . Madara , T . Hirst , and R . Holmes . 1995 . J . Cell Biol . 131 : 951 – 962 ) . In this study , we tested whether CT’s apical membrane receptor gan - glioside GM1 acts specifically in toxin action . To do so , we used CT and the related Escherichia coli heat - labile type II enterotoxin LTIIb . CT and LTIIb distinguish between gangliosides GM1 and GD1a at the cell sur - face by virtue of their dissimilar receptor - binding B subunits . The enzymatically active A subunits , how - ever , are homologous . While both toxins bound specifi - cally to human intestinal T84 cells ( K d (cid:60) 5 nM ) , only CT elicited a cAMP - dependent Cl (cid:50) secretory response . LTIIb , however , was more potent than CT in eliciting a cAMP - dependent response from mouse Y1 adrenal cells ( toxic dose 10 vs . 300 pg / well ) . In T84 cells , CT fractionated with caveolae - like detergent - insoluble membranes , but LTIIb did not . To investigate further the relationship between the specificity of ganglioside binding and partitioning into detergent - insoluble mem - branes and signal transduction , CT and LTIIb chimeric toxins were prepared . Analysis of these chimeric toxins confirmed that toxin - induced signal transduction de - pended critically on the specificity of ganglioside struc - ture . The mechanism ( s ) by which ganglioside GM1 functions in signal transduction likely depends on cou - pling CT with caveolae or caveolae - related membrane domains . I n polarized epithelial cells , signal transduction by chol - era toxin ( CT ) 1 and the structurally related Escheri - chia coli heat - labile toxin type I ( LTI ) requires en - docytosis of toxin – receptor complexes into the apical endosome , retrograde transport into Golgi cisternae or ER ( Lencer et al . , 1992 , 1993 , 1995 a ; Orlandi et al . , 1993 ; Majoul et al . , 1996 ; Orlandi , 1997 ) , and finally transport of toxin across the cell to its site of action on the basolateral membrane . In the human intestine , this process leads to intestinal salt and water secretion and the massive diar - rhea seen in cholera . CT and LTI are composed of five identical B polypep - tides that bind GM1 at the cell surface , and a single A polypeptide . The A polypeptide is composed of two do - mains ( A 1 and A 2 ) linked by an exposed loop containing a site for proteolytic cleavage and a disulfide bond that bridges the cleavage site ( Sixma et al . , 1991 ; Spangler , 1992 ; Zhang et al . , 1995 ) . The pentameric B subunit ( 55 kD ) binds specifically five GM1 molecules with high affin - ity . Proteolytic cleavage within the exposed loop of the A subunit and reduction generates the enzymatically active A 1 peptide ( (cid:122) 22 kD ) , which enters the cell and activates adenylyl cyclase by catalyzing the ADP - ribosylation of the (cid:97) subunit of the heterotrimeric GTPase Gs ( for review see Spangler , 1992 ) . The A 2 peptide ( (cid:122) 5 kD ) forms the scaf - folding that tethers the A and B subunits together and contains a COOH - terminal K ( R ) DEL motif . The KDEL - motif protrudes from the pentameric B subunit on the side that binds GM1 at the cell surface ( Zhang et al . , 1995 ) . Based on our published data , we have proposed that tar - geting of toxin into the cell may plausibly depend on the structure and function of the toxin’s endogenous receptor ganglioside GM1 ( Lencer et al . , 1995 a ) . For example , we find that the endoplasmic reticulum targeting K ( R ) DEL Address all correspondence to W . I . Lencer , M .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 141 , 1998 918 motif on the toxin’s A subunit is not absolutely required for toxin action ( but in its absence , signal transduction is significantly less efficient ) , and that purified CT B subunit , in the absence of signals from A subunit , will also traverse a transcytotic pathway . Thus , simply binding or clustering GM1 by the toxin’s pentameric B subunit appears to be sufficient for transport into all intracellular compartments necessary for signal transduction . Whether GM1 provides specific targeting information to this system ( or whether other glycosphingolipids could perform the same func - tion ) , and if so , how such a glycolipid may act as a sorting motif in vesicular transport , remains unknown . In many cell types , a large fraction of GM1 clusters in caveolae . In fact , cholera toxin has already been used to identify caveolae in human A431 epidermoid cells , canine MDCK epithelial cells , and endothelium of rat lung ( Par - ton , 1994 ; Parton et al . , 1994 ; Schnitzer et al . , 1995 b ) . Ca - veolae and related membrane structures display light den - sity and resistance to detergent extraction by virtue of their lipid and possibly protein composition ( Anderson , 1993 a ; Schroeder et al . , 1994 ; Simons and Ikonen , 1997 ) . These specialized membrane domains exist on both intra - cellular ( Brown and Rose , 1992 ) and plasma membranes ( Anderson , 1993 a ) . Caveolae are thought to mediate key cellular functions that include ligand - induced signal trans - duction , protein and lipid sorting , endocytosis , and ( in vas - cular endothelium ) transcytosis ( van Meer and Palade , 1989 ; Simons and Wandinger - Ness , 1990 ; Anderson et al . , 1992 ; Dupree et al . , 1993 ; van Meer , 1993 ; Lisanti et al . , 1994 ; Parton et al . , 1994 ; Schnitzer et al . , 1994 , 1995 c ; Rodgers and Rose , 1996 ; Liu et al . , 1997 ) . Whether caveo - lae mediate toxin - induced signal transduction in human intestine , however , remains unknown . Our aim in the present study was to test whether toxin action depends on binding or clustering GM1 specifically . To address this hypothesis , we took advantage of a mem - ber of the family of related type II heat - labile toxins pro - duced by E . coli . The structures of type II toxins are simi - lar but not identical to CT or LTI ( Guth et al . , 1986 ; Holmes et al . , 1986 ; Chang et al . , 1987 ; Fukuta et al . , 1988 ) . The major structural differences are found in the penta - meric B subunits , and this is reflected functionally in that CT or LTI and type II toxins bind to different glycosphin - golipids . In particular , the type II toxin LTIIb binds with highest affinity to ganglioside GD1a and not at all to GM1 ( Fukuta et al . , 1988 ) . The structure and function of the en - zymatic A subunits of CT or LTI and LTIIb , however , are homologous . They are ADP - ribosyltransferases with simi - lar enzymatic activities in vitro ( Chang et al . , 1987 ; Lee et al . , 1991 ) . Like CT , the A 2 peptide of LTIIb also contains a COOH - terminal KDEL - motif that protrudes from the B pentamer in a position where the KDEL - sequence may plausibly interact with membrane receptors ( van den Ak - ker et al . , 1996 ) . The studies reported here show that signal transduction by heat - labile enterotoxins in the model polarized intesti - nal cell line T84 depends specifically on binding or cluster - ing GM1 . Binding to a closely related ganglioside , GD1a , ren - ders the toxin inactive . We also find that ganglioside structure dictates toxin association with caveolae - like mem - brane domains . Thus , the mechanism ( s ) by which ganglio - side GM1 functions in signal transduction likely depends on the ability of GM1 to couple cholera and related heat - labile enterotoxins with caveolae or caveolae - related mem - brane structures . Materials and Methods Materials , Toxins , and Antibodies CT was obtained from Calbiochem ( San Diego , CA ) , cholera toxin B sub - unit – colloidal gold was from List Biological Laboratories ( Campbell , CA ) , and purified gangliosides GM1 and GD1a from Matreya , Inc . ( Pleasant Gap , PA ) . All other commercially available reagents were from Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) unless otherwise stated . Periplasmic extracts from recombinant E . coli containing CT and LTIIb and purified LTIIb were prepared as previously described ( Lencer et al . , 1995 a ) . Where indicated , LTIIb ( 20 nM ) was activated by preincu - bation with 20 (cid:109) g / ml trypsin for 30 min at 30 (cid:56) C as described ( Lencer et al . , 1997 ) . Purified anthrax protective antigen was a gift from R . J . Collier ( Harvard Medical School ) . Purified mutant LT G33D B subunit was a gift from T . R . Hirst ( University of Bristol , Bristol , UK ) . Sulfo - NHS - biotin ( Pierce Chemical Co . , Rockford , IL ) was used to label purified CT and LTIIb as previously described ( Lencer et al . , 1992 ) . Antibodies used in - cluded polyclonal rabbit antiserum against CT A and B subunits ( Lencer et al . , 1995 b ) and LTIIb holotoxin ( Connell and Holmes , 1992 ) and mono - clonal antibodies raised against CT B and A subunits ( Holmes and Twiddy , 1983 ) and LTIIb B and A subunits ( as described in Holmes and Twiddy , 1983 ) . Monoclonal antibody 11E5 is specific for the B subunit of LtIIb , and 3C4 is specific for the A subunit of LTIIb . Neither 11E5 nor 3C4 cross - reacts with the A or B subunit of CT . Cell Culture T84 and Y1 cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD ) were cultured and passaged as previously described ( Lencer et al . , 1995 a ) . Cells from passages 70 – 98 ( T84 ) and 41 – 70 ( Y1 ) were used for these experiments . Preparation of Recombinant Wild - Type and Mutant CT and LTIIb Chimeric Toxins All holotoxin - producing clones were made in the vector pBluescript SKII (cid:50) ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) and were expressed from the IPTG - inducible lac promoter of the vector . Table I identifies the toxin constructs used in this study . pMGJ148 encodes native CT holotoxin with the LTIIb - B gene leader expressing CT B ( Jobling et al . , 1997 ) , and pMGJ176 encodes native LTIIb holotoxin . Chimeric holotoxin clones were made by recipro - cal exchange of restriction fragments encoding the A 1 polypeptide or A 2 and B polypeptides using the unique ClaI restriction site naturally present in the DNA encoding the 11 - residue loop between cys - 187 of CT A 1 and cys - 199 of CT A 2 . A ClaI restriction site was introduced into the DNA en - coding the loop between cys - 185 of LTIIb A 1 and cys - 197 of LTIIb A 2 in two steps . First , the LTIIb - A 1 coding sequence was PCR - amplified from a native LTIIb holotoxin clone ( MGJ176 ) with oligonucleotides IIbA1RC ( 5 (cid:57) GCCATCGATGCTTTATTATTTGGTAGACA3 (cid:57) ) and M13 reverse primer and cloned into SmaI - digested pUC18 to produce pMGJ182 . Sec - ond , the LTIIb - A 2 - B coding sequence was similarly amplified and cloned using oligonucleotides IIb - A 2 ( 5 (cid:57) CGGGCATCGATGGATACCTGTG - CCTC3 (cid:57) ) and M13 - 20 primer to produce pMGJ178 . An XbaI - ClaI frag - ment of pMGJ182 ( LTIIb - A 1 ) and a ClaI - SalI fragment of pMGJ178 ( LTIIb - A 2 - B ) were cloned into XbaI - SalI – digested pBluescript SKII (cid:50) to create pMGJ183 . This clone produced LTIIb - holotoxin with a single amino acid substitution ( S193M ) in the A 1 - A 2 loop encoded by the ClaI site . A ClaI - KpnI fragment of pMGJ178 ( LTIIb - A 2 - B ) was cloned into a ClaI - KpnI – cut pMGJ148 to create pMGJ179 encoding the CT - A 1 / LTIIb - A 2 / LTIIb - B chimera . An NheI - ClaI fragment of pMGJ182 ( LTIIb A 1 ) was cloned into XbaI - ClaI – cut pMGJ148 to create pMGJ184 , encoding the LTIIb - A 1 / CT - A 2 / CT - B chimera . Plasmid pMGJ187 was created to produce an LTIIb A - CT B chimera with a fusion joint in the middle of the A 2 domain so as to maximize the homologous A 1 – A 2 and A 2 – B domain interactions , predicted to enhance holotoxin formation . The dibasic KR peptide at the fusion joint is con - served between CT A 2 and LTIIb A 2 and is located at the point where the A 2 domain penetrates the B subunit in both toxins . A hybrid LTIIb A2 - CT A2 oligonucleotide IIBCTKR ( KR coding sequence underlined ; Wolf et al . Sorting of Cholera Toxin by Ganglioside GM1 919 TTTAAGAAATATATAAAGAGACAAATATTTTCAGGC ) was used in conjunction with a CTB reverse primer ( SP4 , CTTGAAAAGTTGCA - CCATTC ) to PCR amplify the region encoding CT - A 2 - CT - B from a clone lacking T7 primer sequences . LTIIb - A 1 sequences were added by using the PCR product to prime on a IIb holotoxin clone and reamplifying with a vector primer ( T7 ; Stratagene ) and SP4 . The product was then digested with AccI and cloned into pMGJ184 , replacing the A 2 encoding sequences . For chimeric toxins 179 ( pMGJ179 ) and 184 ( pMGJ184 ) , junctions of the chimeric A subunits were made within the C - loop connecting the A 1 and A 2 peptides . This preserved the complete A 2 peptide , including the KDEL - motif , and all interactions between the A 2 peptide and its respec - tive pentameric B subunit . For chimeric toxin 187 ( pMGJ187 ) , the junc - tion of the chimeric A subunit was in the middle of the A 2 domain , thereby conserving the entire loop region between A 1 and A 2 from LTIIb . Preparation of Toxin Extracts 500 ml Luria Broth cultures of E . coli TE1 bearing each of the plasmids in Table I were grown at 37 (cid:56) C with 50 (cid:109) g / ml each of ampicillin and methicil - lin and induced overnight with 200 (cid:109) M IPTG . Extracts were prepared es - sentially according to French et al . ( 1996 ) , except that cells were resus - pended in 15 ml 20 % sucrose , 0 . 2 M Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mg / ml lysozyme , incubated for 15 min at ambient temperature followed by os - motic shock with the addition of 15 ml cold sterile water , mixed , and incu - bated 15 min on ice . The supernatant was cleared by centrifugation at 16 , 000 g at 4 (cid:56) C and retained as crude toxin extract . Periplasmic extracts were dialyzed overnight at 4 (cid:56) C against 1 , 000 - vol excess HBSS ( containing in g / liter 0 . 185 CaCl 2 , 0 . 098 MgSO 4 , 0 . 4 KCl , 0 . 06 KH 2 PO 4 , 8 NaCl , 0 . 048 Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 glucose , to which 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , was added ) . Electrophysiology , Mouse Y1 Adrenal Cell , and Toxin - binding Assays HBSS was used for all assays unless otherwise stated . An antibody - based or ligand - binding ELISA was used to define binding isotherms of purified CT and LTIIb , and biotin - labeled LTIIb was used to define binding speci - ficity as previously described ( Lencer et al . , 1995 c ) . For electrophysiologi - cal studies on T84 cells , measurements of short circuit current ( Isc ) and re - sistance ( R ) were performed with 0 . 33 cm 2 monolayers as previously described ( Lencer et al . , 1992 ) . Toxin action on mouse Y1 adrenal cells was assessed as a cAMP - dependent shape change as described ( Guth et al . , 1986 ) . Two methods were used to calibrate toxin activity . First , 100 - (cid:109) l samples of serial twofold dilutions in culture medium of periplasmic extracts containing toxins were applied to 96 - well plates of Y1 cells grown to confluence for 2 d . After overnight incubation at 37 (cid:56) C , toxin - induced shape change was scored based on the fraction of cells exhibiting rounding , as assessed by light mi - croscopy . Scores from 0 to 4 (cid:49) were assigned as follows : 4 (cid:49) ( 75 – 100 % cells rounded ) , 3 (cid:49) ( 50 – 75 % cells rounded ) , 2 (cid:49) ( 25 – 50 % cells rounded ) , 1 (cid:49) ( (cid:44) 25 % cells rounded ) , and 0 ( no detectable cell rounding ) . The amount of toxin present in the last dilution giving 4 (cid:49) rounding was as - signed a value of 1 unit ( U ) . Toxin titers were calculated as ( dilution fac - tor ) (cid:51) 10 U / ml original sample . In the second method , toxin titers were as - sessed in a 3 - h time course and graded against standard curves constructed in parallel by serial dilutions of purified LTIIb ( 20 – 0 . 08 nM ) . Detergent Extractions of Filter - grown Monolayers T84 cells grown on 5 - cm 2 filters were incubated apically with 20 nM CT , LTIIb , or no toxin in HBSS for 20 – 30 min at 4 (cid:56) C , washed to remove all unbound toxin , immersed in 1 . 0 ml of ice - cold 1 % TTBS ( 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris , 1 % Triton X - 100 , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 175 mM PMSF , and 20 (cid:109) g / ml chy - mostatin ) , and tumbled end over end for 30 min at 4 (cid:56) C . Triton - soluble proteins were removed and saved . Triton - insoluble proteins were solubi - lized in 1 % TTBS containing 1 % N - octylglucoside at 4 (cid:56) C . Acetone pre - cipitates of solubilized proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 15 , 000 – 20 , 000 g for 15 min and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting ( Lencer et al . , 1995 b ) . Sucrose Equilibrium Density Centrifugation One or two confluent monolayers of T84 ( 45 cm 2 each ) or a 150 - cm 2 flask of confluent Y1 cells was used for isolation of detergent - insoluble mem - branes . All steps were performed at 4 (cid:56) C . Cells were scraped into 2 ml of ice - cold 1 % TTBS and homogenized with five strokes in a tight - fitting Dounce homogenizer on ice . The homogenate was adjusted to 40 % su - crose by addition of 2 ml of 80 % sucrose in 1 % TTBS , layered under a lin - ear 5 – 30 % sucrose gradient , and centrifuged at 39 , 000 rpm for 16 – 20 h in a swinging bucket rotor ( model SW41 ; Beckman Instruments , Palo Alto , CA ) . The presence of a floating membrane fraction was noted visually . Sequential 0 . 5 - or 1 - ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradi - ent . 20 (cid:109) l from each fraction was analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie stain or Western / ligand blot . Sucrose density was monitored by refractom - etry . Light scattering was measured as absorbance at 600 nm ( Spectra Max ; Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) . Ganglioside Extraction and Analysis Ganglioside - enriched lipid extracts and ligand blots using LTIIb and CT were prepared as modified from described methods ( Fukuta et al . , 1988 ; Schnaar and Needham , 1994 ) . Total lipids were extracted from 1 , 500 – 4 , 500 cm 2 confluent T84 monolayers in chloroform / methanol / water ( 10 : 10 : 1 ) in a total volume of 10 ml . For quantitative thin layer chromatography , phospholipids and cholesterol were removed on silica gel . Thereafter , the glycosphingolipids were separated by ion exchange chromatography , and the gangliosides were eluted in a monosialoganglioside fraction and poly - sialoganglioside fraction . The fractions were separated on HPTLC plates ( Silica Gel 60 ; E . Merck , Darmstadt , Federal Republic of Germany ) , and the gangliotetrose series ( GM1 , GD1a , GD1b , and GT1b ) was detected by ligand blotting with CT B subunit ( 1 nM ) and anti – CT B subunit antibod - ies in an ELISA performed on the HPTLC plate . Values are presented as total mass gangliosides ( pmol ) per mg cell protein . For “dot blots” and for qualitative thin layer chromatography , the concentrated total lipid ex - tracts were enriched for gangliosides by Folch cut in chloroform / metha - nol / water ( 10 : 10 : 1 ) . 100 ng each of ganglioside GM1 and GD1a and 10 – 15 (cid:109) l representing 20 – 30 % of total T84 cell ganglioside - enriched lipid ex - tracts were applied to HPTLC strips or HPTLC plates and analyzed as de - Table I .

For dot blots , GM1 and GD1a were detected by ligand blotting with CT ( 1 nM ) and LTIIb ( 1 nM ) and anti - CT or LTIIb antibodies in an ELISA performed on the HPTLC plate . Statistics Data were analyzed using Statview 512 (cid:49) software ( Brainpower , Inc . , Cal - abasas , CA ) . Results We used CT and the type II heat - labile toxin from E . coli LTIIb to test the hypothesis that GM1 provides specificity to toxin action . LTIIb and CT are structurally and func - tionally homologous . LTIIb , however , binds GD1a and displays no detectable binding to GM1 ( Fukuta et al . , 1988 ; Lee et al . , 1991 ) . CT and LTIIb Bind Specifically to T84 Cell Apical Membranes Initial experiments showed that both CT and LTIIb bound to receptors on T84 cells with high affinity ( 2 – 5 nM ) ( Fig . 1 A ) . Competition experiments showed that receptor bind - ing was specific ( Fig . 1 B ) . Competition with LTIIb ( 1 (cid:109) M ) inhibited by 70 % the binding of biotin - labeled LTIIb to T84 cell membranes . Binding was not inhibited , however , by competition with anthrax protective antigen ( 200 nM ) , chicken IgY ( 1 (cid:109) M ) , bovine serum albumin ( 5 mg / ml ) , or rLTI B subunit ( G33D ) ( 500 nM ) . Similarly for CT , com - petition with rCT B subunit inhibited CT binding by 93 % . To demonstrate that T84 cells express GD1a and GM1 , ganglioside - enriched lipid extracts of confluent monolay - ers of T84 cells ( 1 , 500 – 4 , 500 cm 2 ) were prepared and dot - ted onto HPTLC strips , dried , blocked for nonspecific binding , and assessed for the presence of GM1 and GD1a by ligand affinity - blot using purified CT ( 20 nM ) or rLTIIb ( 20 nM ) . Purified GM1 and GD1a were used as standards ( 300 ng each ) . Fig . 2 A shows that T84 cells ex - press lipids to which both CT and LTIIb bind specifically . Anthrax toxin protective antigen ( 12 nM ) did not label the lipid dot blots . Neither CT nor LTIIb bound proteins of total T84 cell extracts ( 50 – 100 (cid:109) g ) as assessed by SDS - PAGE and ligand blot ( not shown ) . Analysis of glycolipid composition by thin layer chromatography confirmed the presence of GM1 and GD1a in polarized T84 cell mem - branes ( Fig . 2 B ) . T84 cells contained per microgram total Figure 1 . CT and LTIIb bind specifically with high affinity to intact T84 monolayers .

Ganglioside - enriched lipid extracts of T84 cell monolayers contain both GM1 and GD1a . ( A ) Lipid extracts prepared from 1 , 500 cm 2 confluent T84 cells ( third lane ) and purified GM1 ( first lane ) and GD1a ( second lane ) standards ( 300 ng each ) were applied to activated sil - ica gel plates , processed as described in Materials and Methods , and ligand blotted with CT ( 1 nM , top ) or LTIIb ( 1 nM , bottom ) . Toxin bind - ing to ganglioside extracts was assessed by application of specific antitoxin antibod - ies , followed by HRP - conju - gated secondary antibody , and development using en - hanced chemiluminescence .

In this preparation , the bulk of acidic gly - colipids including GD1a remained associated with the lower lipid soluble phase because of conditions of Folch extraction ( low salt and pH ) . Gangliosides migrating with GD1a are apparent in the third lane ( and faintly in the fourth ) . Gangliosides migrating with GM1 are apparent in the fourth lane . Wolf et al .

Thus , T84 cells express specific high - affinity receptors for LTIIb and CT , which represent ganglioside GD1a and GM1 , re - spectively . Toxin Binding to GM1 but Not GD1a Leads to a Physiological Response We next examined the ability of CT and LTIIb to elicit cAMP - dependent Cl (cid:50) secretion . Fig . 3 A shows the time course of Cl (cid:50) secretion elicited by CT ( 20 nM ) or LTIIb ( 20 nM ) applied to apical reservoirs of T84 cell monolay - ers . After a characteristic “lag” phase , CT elicited a brisk secretory response . LTIIb , however , was inactive . The ad - dition of vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP , 3 nM ) to baso - lateral reservoirs at 125 min elicited a rapid response , demonstrating the viability of these monolayers . The in - ability of LTIIb to elicit a response from T84 cells was not dose dependent , as 500 nM LTIIb was still inactive . ( A small signal , Isc (cid:53) 4 . 8 (cid:109) A / cm 2 was obtained at 10 (cid:109) M LTIIb , n (cid:53) 2 . ) Structural differences between CT and LTIIb in the C - loop connecting the A 1 and A 2 peptides did not explain these results since proteolytic activation of the LTIIb A subunit by trypsin pretreatment in vitro had no effect on signal transduction by LTIIb ( n (cid:53) 2 ) . LTIIb was also not active when applied to basolateral membranes of T84 cells , indicating that toxin function did not depend on cell polarity ( data not shown ) . To demonstrate that LTIIb was nonetheless as equally functional as an ADP - ribosyl transferase , we applied both CT and LTIIb to mouse Y1 adrenal cells . Y1 adrenal cells respond to cAMP - agonists , including both CT and LTIIb with a characteristic shape change ( Fig . 3 , B – E ) . In this assay , LTIIb displayed greater potency than CT ( toxic dose 10 vs . 300 pg / well , LTIIb vs . CT ) . Data from 12 independent experiments on T84 cells are summarized in Table II . The results of these studies show that high - affinity binding of LTIIb to the cell surface of T84 cells is not sufficient for signal transduction . These re - sults provide evidence that signal transduction by CT in T84 cells depends on toxin binding or clustering GM1 spe - cifically—a function of the toxin’s B subunit . Functional Association of Ganglioside GM1 with Detergent - insoluble Membrane Domains The requirement for binding GM1 specifically in toxin ac - tion implies that GM1 can distinguish between membrane components in T84 cells that function in toxin - induced sig - nal transduction . Based on available evidence , the mem - brane structures recognized by GM1 ( or clusters of GM1 ) and likely to subserve such a function are caveolae or “ca - veolae - like” detergent - insoluble membrane domains ( Par - ton , 1994 ; Parton and Simons , 1995 ; Schnitzer et al . , 1995 b , 1996 ) . Thus , to test whether CT and LTIIb may partition differentially into caveolae - like membranes , we examined the detergent - solubility of CT – GM1 and LTIIb – GD1a complexes in T84 cells . Initial studies showed that the CT – GM1 complex frac - tionated with Triton - insoluble membrane fractions iso - lated from T84 cell monolayers at 4 (cid:56) C ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . These membrane fractions were enriched (cid:46) 100 - fold in a subset of cellular proteins that included CD73 ( the GPI - linked 5 (cid:57) - ectonucleotidase ) and caveolin 1 ( Strohmeier et al . , 1997 ) but were depleted in B1 integrins and the Na (cid:49) K (cid:49) 2Cl (cid:50) cotransporter ( data not shown ) . The interactions be - tween CT – GM1 and Triton - insoluble membranes were stable and resisted six successive rounds of extraction in detergent ( as assessed biochemically ) . While some vari - ability was observed in the fraction of CT – GM1 solubi - lized by 1 % Triton X - 100 , CT – GM1 always fractionated Figure 3 .

In six of nine stud - ies , the overwhelming mass of CT – GM1 fractionated with these membranes ( as in Fig . 4 A ) . In contrast , nearly all of the LTIIb – GD1a complex was solubilized by 1 % Triton X - 100 , and both A and B subunits of LTIIb were found at the bottom of the gradient with all other solubilized pro - teins ( Fig . 4 B , n (cid:53) 9 ) . In some studies ( especially when concentrations (cid:46) 50 nM were used ) , a small amount of LTIIb could be detected in detergent - insoluble light - den - sity membrane fractions ( estimated (cid:44) 1 – 2 % ) . In all studies on T84 cells , the differential association of LTIIb and CT with Triton - insoluble membranes was readily apparent . As CT elicited a physiological response from T84 cells but LTIIb did not , these data raised the distinct possibility that toxin association with detergent - insoluble membranes may be required for signal transduction . To test this idea , mouse Y1 adrenal cells were examined . As defined above , both CT and LTIIb elicit a cAMP - dependent shape change in this cell type , and LTIIb is more potent than CT . Thus , if toxin action depends on association with deter - gent - insoluble membranes , studies on Y1 cells should show that both CT – GM1 and LTIIb – GD1a fractionate with membranes that float up into the sucrose gradient af - ter detergent extraction . These studies showed the pre - dicted results . In Y1 cells , both CT – GM1 and LTIIb – GD1a complexes fractionated with detergent - insoluble membranes ( Fig . 4 C , n (cid:53) 2 ) . Thus , in human T84 and mouse Y1 cells , the ability of each toxin to associate with this specialized membrane fraction correlated with the ability of each toxin to elicit a cAMP - dependent intracel - lular signal . LTIIb - CT Chimeric Toxins To verify this idea , recombinant chimeric toxins were pre - pared by combining the enzymatic A 1 domains of CT with the A 2 domains and B subunit of LTIIb , and vice versa ( Table I ) . In doing so , LTIIb A subunits with CT A 2 do - mains were targeted into the cell by CT B subunits , which bind GM1 ( chimeras 187 and 184 , termed LTIIb A / CT B ) , and CT A subunits with LTIIb A 2 domains were targeted into the cell by LTIIb B subunits , which bind GD1a ( chi - mera 179 , termed CT A / LTIIb B ) . Recombinant LTIIb S193M ( see Materials and Methods ) was used to construct the chimeric toxins described above , and this toxin pre - dicted to exhibit wild - type phenotype was also prepared . Trypsin - cleavage sites between A 1 and A 2 domains were present in all of the chimeric toxins . The chimeras 184 and 187 containing alternative fusion sites within the A polypeptide were generated to test for possible effects of the fusion joint location on A and B subunit assembly and function . Western blots of each preparation confirmed the predicted structures of the chimeric toxins ( data not shown ) . The function of each recombinant toxin in periplasmic extracts prepared from E . coli TE1 was examined by ap - plying samples of the extracts to apical membranes of po - Figure 4 .

Polarized human intestinal T84 or nonpolarized mouse Y1 adrenal cell monolayers were exposed apically to CT ( 20 nM ) or LTIIb ( 20 nM ) at 4 (cid:56) C for 30 min , and unbound toxins were removed by washing .

Sorting of Cholera Toxin by Ganglioside GM1 923 larized human intestinal T84 cell monolayers or to mouse Y1 adrenal cells . Preparations of all wild - type and chi - meric toxins elicited a potent cAMP - dependent shape change from mouse Y1 adrenal cells , demonstrating that all toxins were functional . Thus , in Y1 cells , toxin binding to either GM1 or GD1a led to cAMP - dependent shape change . In contrast , signal transduction by chimeric toxins applied to T84 cells was dependent on toxin binding to GM1 specifically . Chimeric Toxins That Enter the Cell via Binding or Clustering GM1 Fig . 5 A shows that wild - type LTIIb and LTIIb S193M tox - ins , which bind GD1a ( 5 , 000 U / ml ) , were inactive when applied to apical membranes of T84 monolayers ( as ex - pected ) . The chimeric toxin 184 ( LTIIb A / CT B , 5 , 000 U / ml ) , however , which was predicted to enter the cell via binding GM1 , elicited a distinct Cl (cid:50) secretory response . Nearly identical results were obtained with chimeric toxin 187 ( also LTIIb A / CT B , 5 , 000 U / ml ) , indicating that the failure of wild - type LTIIb to elicit a secretory response in T84 cells cannot be due solely to the structure of the peptide loop between C185 to C197 that joins the A 1 and A 2 do - mains of LTIIb . We also found that currents induced by LTIIb A / CT B chimeric toxins were not as great as those in - duced by wild - type ( wt ) CT , suggesting that CT and LTIIb A subunits may display differential potencies for intact hu - man T84 cells . These data are summarized in Fig . 6 A . To show that the Cl (cid:50) secretory response induced by chi - meric toxin 184 ( LTIIb A / CT B ) was dependent on the spec - ificity of B subunit binding to GM1 , we examined the time course of toxin action in the presence or absence of excess soluble GM1 or GD1a as competitive and specific inhibi - tors of B subunit function . Fig . 5 B shows that preincuba - tion with 10 (cid:109) M GM1 blocked completely the secretory response elicited by chimera 184 ( LTIIb A / CT B , 5 , 000 U / ml ) . Preincubation with GD1a ( 10 (cid:109) M ) , however , had no effect . Furthermore , competition with rCT B subunit to block binding of holotoxin also inhibited ( dose dependently ) the Cl (cid:50) secretory response induced by chimera 184 ( LTIIb A / CT B ) . Competition with 10 (cid:109) M LTIIb had no inhibitory effect , but these studies ( though still interpretable ) were confounded by a small secretory response induced by LTIIb at this high dose ( 4 . 8 (cid:109) A / cm 2 , n (cid:53) 2 ) . These data ( summarized in Fig . 6 A ) show that the secretory response elicited by chimera 184 ( LTIIb A / CT B ) was dependent on binding GM1 , a function of its chimeric B subunit . Chimeric Toxins That Enter the Cell via Binding or Clustering GD1a Fig . 5 C shows the secretory response elicited by the com - plementary chimeric toxin 179 ( CT A / LTIIb B ) . While re - combinant wild - type CT elicited a strong secretory re - sponse ( as expected ) , toxin - induced Cl (cid:50) secretion was greatly attenuated when the CT A subunit was forced to enter the cell via binding GD1a ( data summarized in Fig . 6 B ) . In two of three independent preparations , periplasmic extracts containing chimeric toxin 179 were completely in - active on T84 cells , even though the chimeric toxin elicited a potent cAMP - dependent response from Y1 cells ( 5 , 000 U / ml ) . In all studies , periplasmic extracts from E . coli TE1 not harboring toxin - producing plasmids were physiologi - cally inactive when applied to either cell type ( human T84 or mouse Y1 , data not shown ) . Thus , to show that the ac - tion of chimeric toxin 179 ( CT A / LTIIb B ) on Y1 cells was dependent on the specificity of B subunit binding to GD1a ( as predicted ) , we examined the cAMP - dependent shape change induced by chimeric toxin 179 in the presence or absence of excess soluble GM1 or GD1a as competitive Figure 5 .

All toxins were applied in equivalent concentrations of 5 , 000 U / ml as as - sessed by bioassay on Y1 cells . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 141 , 1998 924 and specific inhibitors of B subunit function . Both wt rCT and chimeric toxin 179 ( CT A / LTIIb B ) ( 5 , 000 U / ml ) elicited maximal cell rounding ( 75 – 100 % cells rounded ) after in - cubation at 37 (cid:56) C for 100 min . Preincubation with 10 (cid:109) M GD1a almost completely inhibited the cell rounding re - sponse to chimera 179 ( 0 – 25 % cells rounded at 100 min , n (cid:53) 2 in quadruplicate ) . In contrast , preincubation with 10 (cid:109) M GM1 had no effect ( 75 – 100 % cells rounded at 100 min ) . The converse was found for wt rCT . As expected , preincubation with GM1 ( 10 (cid:109) M ) inhibited the shape change induced by rCT , but preincubation with GD1a ( 10 (cid:109) M ) had no effect . In parallel experiments , signal transduction by wt LTIIb and chimeric toxin 184 ( LTIIb A / CT B ) was also examined in mouse Y1 cells . GM1 ( 10 (cid:109) M ) completely inhibited the response of Y1 cells to chimeric toxin 184 ( LTIIb A / CT B ) ( 0 – 25 % rounded cells at 140 min , n (cid:53) 2 in quadruplicate ) , but GD1a ( 10 (cid:109) M ) had no effect ( 75 – 100 % cells rounded at 140 min ) . Likewise , GD1a inhibited the response to wt LTIIb ( 25 – 50 % rounded cells at 140 min , n (cid:53) 2 in quadru - plicate ) , but GM1 had no effect ( 75 – 100 % cells rounded at 140 min ) . Thus , signal transduction by chimeric toxin 184 and wt LTIIb in Y1 cells was also dependent on the speci - ficity of ganglioside binding . Taken together , these studies show that LTIIb A sub - units were rendered functional in T84 cells by targeting them into T84 cells via binding GM1 ( chimeric toxins 184 and 187 , LTIIb A / CT B ) , and conversely , CT A subunits were rendered inactive by targeting them into the cell by binding GD1a ( chimeric toxin 179 , CT A / LTIIb B ) ( summa - rized in Fig . 6 , A and B ) . Thus , the cAMP - dependent re - sponses elicited by both chimeric toxins 179 ( CT A / LTIIb B ) and 184 ( LTIIb A / CT B ) in mouse Y1 or human T84 cells were dependent on binding GD1a or GM1 , respectively , functions of their chimeric B subunits . Ganglioside Structure Dictates Association with Caveolae - like Membrane Domains To strengthen the correlation between toxin - induced sig - nal transduction and association with caveolae - like deter - gent - insoluble membranes , chimeric toxins 184 ( LTIIb A / CT B ) and 179 ( CT A / LTIIb B ) bound to apical receptors on T84 cell monolayers were solubilized in Triton X - 100 and fractionated on sucrose gradients . Fig . 7 shows that chi - meric toxin 184 ( LTIIb A / CT B ) floated into the sucrose gra - dient as predicted . In contrast , the complementary chi - meric toxin 179 ( CT A / LTIIb B ) was completely solubilized and remained at the bottom of the gradient ( n (cid:53) 2 ) . Thus , in T84 cells , binding ( or clustering ) GM1 dictates both toxin association with detergent - insoluble membrane do - mains and toxin - induced signal transduction . Discussion Functional Specificity of GM1 in CT - induced Signal Transduction The results of these studies show that specific functional properties of GM1 that are not shared by GD1a are essen - tial for cholera toxin action in human intestinal T84 cells . Ganglioside function was assessed using two related en - terotoxins , CT and LTIIb . These toxins distinguish be - tween gangliosides GM1 and GD1a at the cell surface by virtue of their dissimilar receptor binding B subunits . Their enzymatically active A subunits , however , are ho - mologous in structure and function . Both toxins activate adenylyl cyclase inside the cell via the same mechanism of action : ADP - ribosylation of the heterotrimeric GTPase Gs (cid:97) . Our data show that signal transduction by CT and LTIIb depends on the specificity of receptor binding , a function of the toxin’s B subunit . Figure 6 .

Sorting of Cholera Toxin by Ganglioside GM1 925 Two lines of evidence support this view . First , CT and type I E . coli heat - labile toxin LTI bound GM1 in T84 cells and induced a physiological cAMP - dependent Cl (cid:50) secre - tory response ( this study and Lencer et al . , 1995 a , 1997 ) . Unlike CT and LTI , however , type II E . coli heat - labile toxin LTIIb displayed no detectable binding to GM1 , and LTIIb did not elicit a physiological response in T84 cells . Even so , LTIIb bound with high affinity to GD1a on hu - man T84 cells , and the enzymatic A subunit of LTIIb was capable of activating adenylyl cyclase , as evidenced by the cAMP - dependent shape change elicited by LTIIb in cul - tured mouse Y1 adrenal cells . That toxin action depended critically on the specificity of ganglioside binding ( a func - tion of the B subunit ) was confirmed by using recombinant CT and LTIIb chimeric toxins . Thus , LTIIb A subunits were rendered functional in T84 cells by targeting the A subunit into the cell via binding GM1 ( chimeric toxin LTI - Ib A / CT B ) , and conversely the function of CT A subunits were rendered inactive by targeting the A subunit into the cell by binding GD1a ( chimeric toxin CT A / LTIIb B ) . Toxin Action Depends on Association with Detergent - insoluble Membrane Domains We also find that the structure of the ganglioside receptor determines association of toxin with caveolae - like deter - gent - insoluble membrane domains . This was closely corre - lated with toxin function as assessed by the activities of wt CT , LTIIb , and chimeric toxins CT A / LTIIb B and LTIIb A / CT B on human intestinal T84 and mouse Y1 adrenal cells . That partitioning into detergent - insoluble membranes in T84 cells depended critically on the specificity of ganglio - side binding was confirmed by using recombinant CT and LTIIb chimeric toxins as described above . Thus , in human intestinal T84 cells , binding or clustering GM1 , a function of the B subunit , directs CT into a specialized detergent - insoluble membrane fraction . In this respect , GM1 acts as a sorting motif . As glycosphingolipids such as GM1 are lu - minally oriented and cannot span the membrane bilayer to interact with cytoplasmic proteins , these data imply that the functional membrane receptor for CT and LT must in - volve a membrane structure of greater complexity than ganglioside GM1 alone . Based on current evidence , we believe the membrane structure ( s ) most likely to subserve such a sorting function are caveolae or “caveolae - like” detergent - insoluble mem - branes ( Parton et al . , 1995 ; Schnitzer et al . , 1996 ; and this study ) . The fact that GM1 represents a structural compo - nent of caveolae in many other cell types ( Parton , 1994 ; Parton et al . , 1994 ; Schnitzer et al . , 1995 b ) provides evi - dence in support of this hypothesis . Furthermore , that gly - cosphingolipids can self - assemble with other similarly pre - disposed cellular components is well described ( Sharom and Grant , 1978 ; Hakomori , 1983 ; Thompson and Tillack , 1985 ; Simons and van Meer , 1988 ; van Meer et al . , 1989 ; van Genderen and van Meer , 1993 ; van Meer , 1993 ) . Such a propensity for self - assembly may contribute to the driv - ing force for lipid sorting and caveolae biogenesis in many if not all cell types ( Bretscher and Munro , 1993 ; Schroeder et al . , 1994 ; Thomas et al . , 1994 ; Gorodinsky and Harris , 1995 ; Hanada et al . , 1995 ) . On the other hand , detergent - insoluble membranes from T84 cells exclude GD1a in preference to GM1 , but detergent - insoluble membranes from Y1 cells do not . These data provide evidence that membrane components other than gangliosides contribute to caveolae biogenesis , structure , and function , and this likely varies among differentiated cell types and / or species as previously suggested ( Stan et al . , 1997 ) . How specific gangliosides may function as discrete sort - ing motifs for partitioning ligands into membrane subdo - mains , however , remains undefined . The structures of GM1 and GD1a differ most significantly in their respec - tive carbohydrate head groups , and even these are closely related ( Hakomori , 1983 ) . Nonetheless , detergent - insolu - ble membrane microdomains of human intestinal T84 cells clearly distinguish between these similar glycolipids . Thus , one possibility is that carbohydrate head groups may de - fine specificity in this system . If so , the results of these studies would imply that epitopes on proteins or lipids res - ident in the exoplasmic bilayer leaflet provide motifs for sorting of membrane components at the cell surface and possibly within endosomes and other transport vesicles ( as previously hypothesized ; Fiedler et al . , 1994 ; Simons and Ikonen , 1997 ) . Alternatively , glycosphingolipids exhibit heterogeneity in structure of their lipid tails ( Hakomori , 1983 ) , and this may also impart specificity to glycolipid function ( Sandvig et al . , 1994 ; Mayor and Maxfield , 1995 ) . When tested experimentally , replacing the ceramide moi - ety on GM1 with aliphatic amines , cholesterol , or phos - pholipid enhanced or reduced CT - induced signal trans - duction in rat glioma C6 cells ( Pacuszka et al . , 1991 ) . Mechanism of Action : Signal Transduction by CT in Human Intestinal T84 Cells Taken together , the results of these studies show that hu - man intestinal T84 cells discriminate between toxin bound to GM1 and GD1a by sorting GM1 – toxin complexes into caveolae - like detergent - insoluble plasma membrane sub - domains . This appears to be critical for toxin function . Based on available data , we can envision two plausible consequences of such sorting on the mechanism of toxin - induced signal transduction . First , by analogy with the biology of GPI - linked ( Roth - berg et al . , 1990 ; Anderson , 1993 b ; Deckert et al . , 1996 ) and dual - acylated proteins ( Shenoy - Scaria et al . , 1994 ; Bhatna - gar and Gordon , 1997 ; Rehm and Ploegh , 1997 ) , CT may Figure 7 .

For gradient labeled chimera 179 , fractions 12 – 16 represent 19 – 28 % sucrose . Fractions 20 – 25 represent solubilized proteins at 40 % su - crose . Association of toxin with detergent - insoluble membranes depends on binding GM1—a function of the toxin’s B subunit . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 141 , 1998 926 ensure its own delivery to its target enzyme adenylyl cy - clase by binding GM1 and thus partitioning itself into ca - veolae - like membrane structures that also cluster Gs (cid:97) and adenylyl cyclase into a functional unit ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) . Alternatively , as signal transduction by CT in polarized cells requires endocytosis and transport of toxin through multiple intracellular compartments ( Lencer et al . , 1992 , 1993 , 1995 a , b ; Orlandi et al . , 1993 ; Majoul et al . , 1996 ; Or - landi , 1997 ) , the results of these studies raise the possibil - ity that GM1 may sort CT into caveolae or caveolae - like membrane structures , which then mediate endocytosis of toxin - receptor complexes . If so , this would fit nicely with morphological evidence that CT enters hepatocytes , fibro - blasts , A431 , and endothelial cells via smooth , non – clath - rin - coated membrane invaginations characteristic of cave - olae ( Montesanto et al . , 1982 ; Tran et al . , 1987 ; Parton et al . , 1994 ; Schnitzer et al . , 1996 ) . The biological plausibility of such a hypothesis is emphasized by evidence that caveolae mediate endocytosis of albumin , alkaline phosphatase , protectin ( CD59 ) , and SV - 40 virus in endothelial , epider - moid A431 , Jurkat T - lymphocyte , and CV1 cell systems ( Parton et al . , 1994 ; Schnitzer et al . , 1994 ; Deckert et al . , 1996 ; Stang et al . , 1997 ) ; that endothelial caveolae contain the transport machinery for vesicular traffic ( Schnitzer et al . , 1995 a , 1996 ) ; and that both GM1 and caveolin - 1 likely re - cycle between the plasma membrane and trans - Golgi in murine NCTC 2071 and rat glioma C6 cells ( GM1 ) ( Fish - man et al . , 1983 ) and in canine MDCK cells and human fibroblasts ( VIP - 21 / caveolin - 1 ) ( Kurzchalia et al . , 1992 , 1994 ; Smart et al . , 1994 ; Conrad et al . , 1995 ) . These data also provide reason to suggest that caveolae - like membrane domains may carry the CT – GM1 complex sequentially from the site of toxin binding on the apical membrane through endosomes to trans - Golgi of human intestinal T84 cells , where the toxin may plausibly encoun - ter KDEL - receptors . We do not envision , however , that caveolae or caveolae - like detergent - insoluble membranes in T84 cells necessarily form unique transport vesicles af - ter endocytosis . Evidence from other cell systems indicates that ligands internalized by non – clathrin - coated and clath - rin - coated mechanisms ultimately merge in common intra - cellular compartments ( Tran et al . , 1987 ; Hansen et al . , 1993 ) . That detergent - insoluble membrane subdomains are present on intracellular organelles and transport vesi - cles ( Brown and Rose , 1992 ; Harder et al . , 1997 ) provides further evidence that such structures may function along - side classic transmembrane receptors to target membrane components to specific sites within the vacuolar network of eukaryotic cells . Whether CT – GM1 complexes in T84 cells remain associated with detergent - insoluble mem - brane subdomains during transport into or beyond the api - cal endosome , however , remains unknown . In summary , the results of these studies show that signal transduction by CT in polarized intestinal epithelial cells depends on binding or clustering specifically the ganglio - side GM1 . Remarkably , toxin binding to the closely re - lated ganglioside GD1a renders the toxin inactive in such polarized epithelial cells . We also find that ganglioside structure dictates toxin association with caveolae - like membrane domains , and this is closely correlated with toxin function . Thus , the mechanism ( s ) by which ganglio - sides GM1 and GD1a function in signal transduction likely depend on their ability to couple cholera and related heat - labile enterotoxins with caveolae or caveolae - related mem - brane subdomains in specific cell types .
