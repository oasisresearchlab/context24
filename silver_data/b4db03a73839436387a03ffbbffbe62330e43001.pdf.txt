Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 Abstract The goal of this work is to develop collaborative mechanisms which help people gain understand - ing of complex phenomena . We start by presenting an online , collaborative system for the study of child development . Moving from practice to theory , we proceed by introducing an abstract mathematical model for user retention , facilitating the design of eﬃcient crowd collaboration systems . The ﬁrst part of the work is dedicated to the Baby CROINC ( CROwd INtelligence Curation ) system , which is an online early - childhood development tracker designed to be both personalized and objective . To meet these goals , we rely on Crowd Curated Intelligence ( CCI ) , a process in which experts curate personalized inputs to connect with the crowd’s aggregate data , providing parents with objective and personalized feedback on their children’s development . We describe Baby CROINC’s design , with a focus on CCI , and assess the extent to which it meets its design goals of objectivity and personalization . In the second part of the work , we present the Collaborative Discovery model of guru - follower dynamics , which explains why “smarter” gurus tend to retain a larger following in the face of competition and limited follower attention . We deﬁne a natural class of retentive scoring rules to model the way followers evaluate gurus they interact with , and show that these rules are tightly connected to the classical notion of truth - eliciting proper scoring rules studied in Deci - sion Theory . We then move our attention from the dynamics of interaction between gurus and followers to the study of the intrinsic properties of distributions that deem them appropriate for instruction by a guru . Finally , we take a modest ﬁrst step towards relating retention mod - els to other established computational complexity measures , namely , dual distance and query complexity , when the phenomena in question can be modeled by a uniform distribution over a linear space . 1 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 1 . Introduction The process of understanding complex phenomena involves a constant interplay between two conﬂicting desires : We want answers , but we want them quick . Understanding complex systems such as climate or the stock market can be very beneﬁcial , but not if we ﬁnd our information too slowly to react . Modeling such systems is intrinsically challenging due to the strong dependencies and interactions between the various parts , and therefore one has to take limited time and budget into account when facing such a problem . One possible way to tackle this is to harness the wisdom of the crowds , building upon the cumulative life experience of many people . In recent years , the crowd - based approach had much success with “technical” tasks such as image recognition [ VAD04 , VAMM + 08 ] , protein folding [ KDC + 11 ] , or quantum simulations [ SPM + 16 ] . These results give rise to a very natural question : Can such methods be applied to the study of complex systems and phenomena ? In the ﬁrst part of this work presented in chapter 2 ( joint work with Ayelet Ben - Sasson , Eli Ben - Sasson and Kayla Jacobs [ BBJS17 ] ) , we approach this question from the empirical side by building a system which uses the power of the crowds to understand a complex phenomenon . The speciﬁc phenomenon that we studied is that of early child development : We present the Baby CROINC system , in which child - development experts and parents of newborn babies work together to collect child - development data and predict developmental outcomes . Crowd - collaboration in the system is maintained through the use of Curated Crowd Intelligence ( CCI ) , a process in which child - development experts curate personalized inputs behind the scenes , solving semantic ambiguities and classifying developmental milestones which are new to the system . After describing the system design principles , we show that the insights accumulated in Baby CROINC are surprisingly valid by comparing them to established literature , and point out the unique developmental insights that emerged using this method . Speciﬁcally , the validity of accumulated data is demonstrated by examining the well - studied cases of preterm vs . fullterm and boys vs . girls , showing signiﬁcant correlations between medians reported in our system and those appearing in known literature . The expressive power of the crowd - based approach was evident through users’ rich and diverse reports , and by the continuous system increase in new developmental concepts . CCI led to a dramatic increase in users’ ability to view crowd - based statistics , indicating that CCI is critical for enabling objectivity while maintaining personaliza - tion . The work on Baby CROINC strengthened our belief that the CCI approach can be generalized to the study of additional phenomena . This leads us to the second part of the work , which is a mathematical model which captures the tension between the limited attention span of the users , and the “complexity” of the phenomenon being considered . In the second part of this work ( chapter 3 , joint work with Eli Ben - Sasson [ BS17 ] ) , we introduce the Collaborative Discovery model , which abstracts the interaction between a guru and her followers . A guru has mental powers of insight that surpass those of her followers , but they ( i ) might not believe in her powers and ( ii ) have limited attention span , so may terminate interaction with her before reaching full “enlightenment” . The main question that interests us is to understand when are gurus likely to retain their ﬂock . This question aﬀects not 2 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 only spiritual leaders , but also automated processes competing to retain users in a congested information world . Our model assumes followers interact with the guru while keeping in mind a single “retention parameter” that measures the strength of their belief in her predictive power , and the guru’s objective is to reinforce and maximize this parameter through “informative” and “correct” predictions . We make three contributions . First , we deﬁne a natural class of retentive scoring rules to model the way followers update their retention parameter and thus evaluate gurus they interact with . These rules are shown to be tightly connected to truth - eliciting “proper scoring rules” studied in Decision Theory since the 1950’s [ McC56 ] . Second , we focus on the intrinsic properties of phenomena that are amenable to collaborative discovery with a guru . Assuming follower types ( or “identities” ) are sampled from a distribution D , the retention complexity of D is the minimal initial retention value ( or “strength of faith” ) that a follower must have before approaching the guru , in order for the guru to retain that follower throughout the collaborative discovery , during which the follower “discovers” his true “identity” . Third and last , we take a modest ﬁrst step towards relating retention complexity to other established computational complexity measures , namely , dual distance and query complexity , when D is a uniform distribution over a linear space . We show that ( i ) the retention complexity of Walsh - Hadamard codes is constant and ( ii ) that of random Low Density Parity Check ( LDPC ) codes is , with high probability , linear in the code’s blocklength ; intriguingly , for these two interesting families of linear codes , retention complexity is roughly equal to query complexity as locally testable codes . Overall , we conclude that crowd - sourcing is a viable tool in the research of human - related phenomena , even in cases where an external source of validation is not available . The viability is demonstrated by the unique empirical results of Baby CROINC . By combining the insights gained from the abstract Collaborative Discovery model , we hope that this work will facilitate the design of similar systems and help increase their eﬃciency , helping the scientiﬁc community shed light on additional phenomena which are currently poorly understood .

Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 2 . Baby CROINC : An Online , Crowd - Based , Expert - Curated System for Monitoring Child Development 2 . 1 . Introduction Developmental screening of young children is important for detecting developmental delays . This can facilitate referral for early intervention [ oCwD + 01 ] when support resources are more eﬀective [ DAC00 ] , as well as reassurance and education of parents of normally developing chil - dren . Early childhood developmental screening is typically performed by pediatricians and baby - wellness specialists , and requires the administration of complex , expensive , and time - consuming standardized tests ; properly interpreting the results requires additional time and expertise [ LHP15 ] . Without expert help , the average parent faces challenges both in admin - istering tests and in deciphering their outcomes . These challenges are particularly relevant to developing countries and lower socio - economic strata , where they become more acute due to the limited availability of screening and patient - provider time [ DSH + 01 ] . New technologies provide new opportunities for parents to monitor and learn about their children’s development . Many parents of young children search the Internet for information re - garding their children’s health and development , and use social media to record developmental milestones [ KBB + 08 , PD09 , WSLB + 06 , BF04 ] . However , it is diﬃcult for parents to obtain information that is both objective and based on quantitative data while still being personalized and catering to speciﬁc , parent - driven interests and concerns . With a few notable exceptions described below , there is a shortage of tools that lie between the two extreme points of stan - dardized tests , which are objective but not personalized , and parenting forums and social media , which are personalized but not objective . 2 . 1 . 1 . Baby CROINC and CCI Baby CROINC ( CROwd INtelligence Curation ) is a free early childhood development tracker available as a website 1 and as iPhone 2 and Android 3 mobile apps . It aims to resolve the tension between objective feedback and personalization , using what we call Curated Crowd Intelligence ( CCI ) . In Baby CROINC , the parent or caregiver creates a custom developmental diary for their child via a sequence of personalized , age - dated milestones like “ﬁrst smile” at ﬁve weeks old or “eating with a spoon” at seven months old . For each diary - recorded event the system provides the user with objective statistical information about the milestone associated with it . In addition , parents / caregivers can view ages predicted for achievement of future milestones . This parent - driven system achieves the goal of personalization because caregivers choose what to record and track , and are encouraged to author new milestones as well as select from 1 baby . croinc . org 2 itunes . apple . com / lt / app / baby - croinc / id1185899162 3 play . google . com / store / apps / details ? id = com . babycroic . croinc 4 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 suggestions of common existing milestones . Simultaneously , information displayed regarding each milestone is quantitatively based on aggregated statistics gathered from all users’ children , thereby achieving the goal of objectivity . To seamlessly integrate these two seemingly contradictory goals , and to ensure the statistics’ high quality , the CCI approach involves child - development experts cleaning and curating the personalized parent - authored data , as explained later in the “Design Goals and Curated Crowd Intelligence ( CCI ) ” section . 2 . 1 . 2 . Related Work When designing Baby CROINC , we have beneﬁted from lessons learned from existing child development educational resources and prior interactive and web - based developmental trackers , several of which are described below . Static , curated data Static , curated information on child development is already available online , and frequently sought out by parents of young children [ KBB + 08 , WSLB + 06 , JDC12 ] . For example , the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) publishes lists of milestones for children aged 0 - 5 years , categorized by developmental domains , in an eﬀort to increase parental knowledge of age - appropriate milestones and red ﬂags . These lists are based on two developmental guideline books for caregivers by the American Academy of Pediatrics [ She09 , Hag08 ] . Parenting forums Many parents are active on various online parenting forums , social media networks , and Q & A communities , asking questions and raising concerns of their own . Sometimes health care professionals and developmental experts respond as well . But overall , this online interaction is limited , biased , and narrow in terms of the data provided by parents and experts [ BSYT16 , MM04 ] . Our CCI approach is further motivated by existing work that stresses the need to improve the quality of general crowd - sourced wisdom using real - time expert guidance [ CDD16 , MJAL17 ] . Popular apps and websites Many technologies allow parents of young children to track their in - fant’s activities , schedule , and / or physical growth . Examples include Trixie Tracker TM [ Mac17 ] , Text4Baby TM [ Inc17 ] and MyPreemie [ DTPL13 ] . Baby CROINC diﬀers from these by ( i ) ex - panding its focus beyond the physical aspects of early childhood development ; and ( ii ) its unique CCI approach . An interesting use of hand - held electronic devices to obtain precise and objective data re - garding early childhood development is reported in [ EDSF + 12 ] . In that experiment , a cohort of 40 expectant mothers was trained to identify important motor milestones and report them on a Palm Pilot . This provided excellent quantitative results but , in contrast with Baby CROINC , required rigorous training and does not support user - driven authoring of new milestones . @ BabySteps is another inﬂuential system , and the ﬁrst interactive Twitter - based developmen - tal tracker [ SPHK14 ] . This system prompts parents via Twitter messages to answer age - relevant developmental questions drawn from the Ages & Stages Questionnaire [ Squ09 ] screening tool . It yields quantitative results [ SPHK14 , KAA09 ] but is not as personalized as Baby CROINC . PatientsLikeMe R (cid:13) ( PLM ) is a popular platform sharing conceptual and technological similar - ities with Baby CROINC , though it does not focus on early childhood development [ FM08 ] . PLM is a social network for people with common health conditions , where users share their symptoms and treatment schedules , mainly through built - in surveys , and track their health status relative to the crowd . Numerous visualization tools assist users in interpreting the data . Research indicates that PLM is associated with increased patient health knowledge and im - proved well - being and decision - making capabilities [ WMF + 10 ] .

Paper Organization In the next section we explain our two design goals and CCI in more detail , followed by a fuller description of Baby CROINC’s features and usage patterns . In the Assessment section , we examine the extent to which our goals are achieved and the impact of CCI . We conclude with a discussion of our ﬁndings and thoughts for future work . 2 . 2 . Baby CROINC Design Goals The main purpose of Baby CROINC is to help parents and caregivers track and understand their child’s unique early developmental trajectory in a personalized and objectively meaningful way , achieving both these seemingly - divergent goals through CCI . 2 . 2 . 1 . Design Goal : Personalization Standardized tests achieve high levels of validity , reliability , and replicability . These advantages come at the price of ( i ) speciﬁcity to particular child development histories and trajectories , ( ii ) rigidity of the test format regardless of changing times and ethnic / cultural environments , and ( iii ) considerable research eﬀort required to calibrate test scores and interpret them [ Sac99 , Kel82 ] . Personalized , non - standardized assessments are more ﬂexible and can adapt quickly to changing environments and parent interests . ( See , e . g . , [ Bea95 ] and references within for more discussion of the ongoing “standardized vs . personalized” testing / assessment debate . ) Our Baby CROINC system oﬀers a high level of personalization by encouraging users to choose and author the milestones recorded for their children ( see Figure 2 . 1 ) . The diaries thus cater to parents’ and caregivers’ speciﬁc interests and concerns . Additionally , the statistical data is presented to users in a child - focused manner ( see Figure 2 . 2 ) , so that the parent can easily interpret what the data says about his or her child . 6 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 Figure 2 . 2 . : Exploring statistics for the “started to smile” milestone with the Baby CROINC mobile app . In the ( simulated ) example above , the child is late for this mile - stone ( 21st percentile , with sample size of n = 119 ) , having a reported age of 2 months . Notice the implementation of the system’s design goals ( see section “Baby CROINC Design Goals” ) : a personalized graphical display , providing objective , non - parametrized , percentile - based statistics . 2 . 2 . 2 . Design Goal : Objectivity The level of personalization we oﬀer in Baby CROINC could lead to a biased and subjective assessment of child development . To compensate for this risk , Baby CROINC is also based on a quantitative research approach , pooling together data from across children’s individual diaries , and presents only non - parametric statistics to avoid making any assumptions about the underlying distribution . 2 . 2 . 3 . Design Goals and Curated Crowd Intelligence ( CCI ) Personalization and objectivity lead to seemingly contradictory data collecting procedures ; per - sonalization means that users log whatever milestones they ﬁnd interesting or relevant , while objectivity and quantitative analysis typically require data from large populations that answer the same set of questions . We have resolved this tension in Baby CROINC with a new process in which experts curate the data provided by users ( the crowd ) . Caregivers may add to their child’s diary any milestone written in whichever words or style they like , in keeping with the goal of personalization . In order to provide objective statistical feedback , expert curators work behind the scenes to connect the milestone to others that are conceptually synonymous , even if the text is diﬀerent . For example , diﬀerent children might have milestones in their diaries with unique texts like “began walking , ” “he started walking , ” “Sophie is walking already ! ”—all of which collectively draw from a shared pool of statistical data . We call this collection of conceptually synonymous milestones with pooled statistics canonical milestone concepts . 7 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 2 . 3 . Description of Baby CROINC 2 . 3 . 1 . User Input and Engagement Baby CROINC aims to provide users with an intuitive and engaging interface . Parents and caregivers simply add developmental milestones their child currently or retrospectively achieved to a dated timeline . Milestone texts are short phrases with a mean length of 6 . 90 words ( median = 6 . 00 words , SD = 3 . 56 words , range = 1 – 27 words ) , and can be either selected from a list of suggestions or authored uniquely by the user . In addition , users may view anticipated upcoming future milestones as reported by older children , as well as milestone - focused parenting tips provided by other caregivers . See Figure 2 . 1 for screenshots of the interface . Automatic e - mail notiﬁcations update users after extended periods of inactivity , encourag - ing them to update their children’s diaries with a suggested list of age - relevant milestones . Additionally , users are notiﬁed when statistics are available for milestones previously without viewable statistics . 2 . 3 . 2 . System Output For each milestone , such as “started crawling , ” Baby CROINC calculates aggregated informa - tion from all other users who added that same milestone to their children’s diaries . Simple percentile - based statistics are presented to users using an intuitive graphical user interface , in - cluding the child’s percentile and the overall age distribution for all children ( see Figure 2 . 2 ) . The statistics are percentile / median - based as opposed to mean - focused , to make them less sen - sitive to undue inﬂuence from statistical outliers ( severely delayed or advanced children whose ages lie at extreme values ) Statistics are only shown for milestones which have appeared in at least ﬁve children’s diaries . For milestones below this threshold , an e - mail notiﬁcation is sent to users once the threshold is reached , alerting them to the availability . The chosen cut - oﬀ balances ( i ) the desire to provide statistics for as many milestones as possible without an overly long delay , against ( ii ) the need for the statistics to be numerically meaningful and based on a non - trivial sample size . We always provide users with the sample size so they can evaluate the strength of the statistics , to distinguish between milestones with few vs . many children . As Baby CROINC continues to expand , the sample sizes for most milestones will increase as they are added for more children , and statistical relevance will increase . 2 . 3 . 3 . System Initialization When the system was launched , before any users joined , 252 canonical milestone concepts were seeded for the introductory Baby CROINC suggestion list . These milestones were drawn from a list of published developmental milestones from the U . S . CDC ( described above in the Related Work section ) . 2 . 3 . 4 . Curated Crowd Intelligence ( CCI ) Expert Review Process The high quality statistical output provided to users is dependent on behind - the - scenes expert curation . The team of experts performing this regular curation has a background in child development and were trained to consistently and reliably curate milestone texts . The ﬁrst author of [ BBJS17 ] , a research academic specializing in child development , conducts periodic reviews of milestone classiﬁcation to ensure quality and to provide team members with additional feedback . 8 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 When a user adds a milestone to their child’s diary via a system suggestion of an existing mile - stone , that child’s age is automatically included in the milestone’s pool of statistics . However , for new milestone texts authored by users , expert curation is required . If the milestone’s underlying idea already exists in the system as a canonical milestone con - cept , but the user’s milestone uses text that varies somewhat in language , the expert merges the milestone with the existing canonical milestone concept to associate them together . For example , a new milestone text “Bobby can ride a three - wheeled bike” could be merged with the existing “learned to use a tricycle . ” This reduces redundant milestone concepts and provides aggregated statistics , independent of minor variations in text language . For milestones that represent an entirely new concept in the system , the expert approves the creation of a new canonical milestone concept . Before it is added to the system - wide list of milestone suggestions , the expert may lightly edit the text if needed to ﬁx typos , remove any references to gender or the child’s name to make it more universal , translate to English if originally written in a non - English language , etc . These language edits always stay true to the original intended meaning of the milestone text , but make it more accessible to other users who may want to add it to their children’s diaries . Additionally , the new canonical milestone concept is assigned one or more developmental domain categories like gross motor , ﬁne motor , language comprehension , etc . ( described further in the Developmental Domains of Milestones section below ) . If the milestone does not qualify as a developmental milestone ( e . g . “ﬁrst visit to Grandma” ) , or is gibberish , the expert ﬂags the milestone to ensure it is not suggested to other users or included in overall developmental statistics . This expert curation process ensures clean , reliable , aggregated statistics for milestones and high - quality suggestions , while preserving the user’s unique , personalized language choices and authorship within their own diaries . 2 . 3 . 5 . Current User Base The current user base ( as of December 27 , 2016 ) comprises 490 users who completed the reg - istration process for a total of 518 children . Users were recruited through advertising on social media , especially targeting groups supporting parents of young children , and through media exposure about the project . A small number of users were recruited as participants in studies performed by university students and researchers in child development , aﬃliated with the ﬁrst author . Most ( 95 . 10 % ) users registered one child , and almost all ( 99 . 03 % ) identiﬁed themselves as the children’s biological mothers . The average age of children at registration was 16 . 15 months ( median = 10 . 37 months , SD = 18 . 34 months , range = 3 days – 13 . 29 years ; see Figure 2 . 3 ) . As ﬁtting for the early childhood focus of the project , 95 . 75 % were under age 4 years , 91 . 70 % were under age 3 years , and 81 . 27 % were under age 2 years . We found the few ( 4 . 25 % ) older children in the system tended to fall into one of two categories : ( 1 ) older children who were the siblings of young children , added by users who focused primarily on the younger sibling ( s ) but also created diaries for the older sibling ( s ) ; and ( 2 ) children with signiﬁcant developmental delays , whose parents continued to closely monitor their milestones past the young ages at which typically - developing children are routinely monitored . It is important to note that since the statistics shown to users are based on percentiles , which are insensitive to outliers , any developmentally - delayed children do not noticeably skew statistics for typically - developing children . About half ( 50 . 97 % ) of children were boys , and the average pregnancy length was 38 . 90 weeks ( median = 39 weeks , SD = 1 . 94 ) , with 8 . 16 % of the sample born preterm ( deﬁned as < 37 weeks 9 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 of gestation ) . For those who provided extra elective information , on average birth weight was 3 . 25 kg ( median = 3 . 27 kg , SD = 0 . 63 kg , range = 1 . 30 – 5 . 19 kg ) , 3 . 28 % of children were part of a multiple - order pregnancy like twins or triplets . A majority ( 67 . 67 % ) were the ﬁrst - born children in their families , and another 19 . 23 % second - born . Figure 2 . 3 . : Child ages at registration ( 0 - 4 years ) . 2 . 3 . 6 . User Activity Patterns Counted together , users added a total of 5 , 894 milestones to their children’s diaries , correspond - ing to 537 canonical milestone concepts ( for example , “started walking” and “began to walk” counted as two milestones but as a single canonical milestone concept ) . The mean number of diary milestones per child , after accounting for some deletions , is 10 . 99 ( median = 5 . 00 , SD = 23 . 63 , range = 1 – 142 , see Figure 2 . 4 ) . Figure 2 . 4 . : Number of milestones per child’s developmental diary . An additional 8 . 97 % of diaries have over 25 milestones , up to 142 ( not shown ) . Users added milestones to their diaries in any of three main ways ( see Figure 2 . 5 ) : 1 . selecting from a list of suggested existing milestones ( 58 . 16 % of milestones ) ; 2 . entering their own unique , original milestone text ( 16 . 74 % ) ; or 10 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 3 . starting to type their own milestone text and then selecting an existing milestone from an “auto - complete” suggestion matching their partial text to a list of existing milestones ( 14 . 93 % ) . No matter the method , users always recorded the age ( or , equivalently , date ) at which their child achieved that milestone . Figure 2 . 5 . : The various methods users chose to add milestones to their children’s diaries . Users mostly add milestones from the accumulating suggestion lists . The age at which a milestone was achieved was typically not the same day the milestone was recorded in Baby CROINC— in fact , only 4 . 13 % of milestones were recorded the same day , though 10 . 26 % were recorded within a week . The lag time between a milestone’s achievement and its addition to the diary could be because the user reported a child’s milestones retrospec - tively for ages prior to Baby CROINC registration , or because they only thought to record it later ( perhaps after seeing it on the list of suggested milestones ) . The median time lag is 2 . 47 months ( mean = 5 . 96 months , SD = 11 . 10 months ) . As is common for websites and mobile apps , most users did not subsequently return to Baby CROINC to add additional milestones to their children’s diaries after their initial visits . ( Users may have returned to view the existing diary and statistics while not entering additional milestones , but such behavior is not currently logged , and hence is not included in the visit count . ) However , 22 . 10 % of users did return for additional diary entries ; of these , over half came back for a single additional visit , and the rest up to 43 times . The overall user activity time range—that is , the time between the dates of the user’s ﬁrst and last / latest active visit— averaged 73 . 56 days ( median = 39 days , SD = 88 . 19 days , range = 1 day – 1 . 25 years ; see Figure 2 . 6 ) with 88 . 70 % within 6 months . Figure 2 . 6 . : User activity time range ( 0 – 6 months ) . 11 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 2 . 4 . Assessment We now examine how Baby CROINC performs with regard to the two design goals of person - alization and objectivity , and explore the impact of CCI . 2 . 4 . 1 . Assessment of Personalization Goal Users personalized their children’s diaries in several ways . Milestone Choices Which milestones to include in their children’s diaries was entirely up to the user , and their choices are highly diverse . For example , consider the three most popular milestones in the system : 1 . “began to smile at people” in 115 ( 22 . 20 % ) diaries , 2 . “started walking alone” in 100 ( 19 . 31 % ) diaries , and 3 . “started crawling” in 96 ( 18 . 53 % ) diaries . Of the 518 children in the system , only 9 ( 1 . 74 % ) had all three milestones in their diaries , while 326 ( 62 . 93 % ) did not have any of them . 15 ( 2 . 89 % ) children had ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) but not ( 3 ) ; another 15 ( 2 . 89 % ) children had both ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) but not ( 2 ) ; and 31 ( 5 . 98 % ) children had both ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) but not ( 1 ) . Developmental Domains of Milestones Part of the user’s choices about which milestone to record is also which aspect of child develop - ment to focus on , whether more physical or communicative . Figure 2 . 7 shows the distribution of all diary milestones as categorized by developmental domain . Gross motor ( e . g . , “started crawling” ) is the most popular domain , followed by ﬁne motor ( “started eating with a spoon” ) , cognitive ( “follows things with eyes” ) , speech ( “began to babble” ) , social ( “shows aﬀection to parents” ) , emotional ( “shows fear of strangers” ) , and language comprehension ( “follows simple instructions” ) . Additional lower - frequency developmental domains , not shown in the ﬁgure , include self - care activities ( “began to help undress himself” ) , non - verbal communication ( “points at what she wants” ) , events ( “ﬁrst day of nursery school” ) , regulation ( “sleeping through the night” ) , medical ( “ﬂu vaccination” ) , and behavior problems ( “started throwing food intentionally” ) . A few parents also chose to record attributes ( “loves music” ) and physical features ( such as weight measurements ) . Ages of Milestones Another part of the user’s choices about which milestone to record is also which age to focus on . Most milestones were reported during the child’s ﬁrst year of life : the overall median milestone age is 229 days ( SD = 308 . 02 , range = birth – 10 . 4 years , see Figure 2 . 8 ) , and 97 . 17 % of milestones were reported for under the age of four years . As expected , this milestone age distribution followed the general shape of the distribution of ages at registration ( Figure 2 . 3 ) . For those children with at least two diary milestones , the average age range of reported milestones—i . e . , the time gap between the youngest to the oldest milestone within the diary— is 9 . 52 months ( median = 6 . 08 months , SD = 12 . 17 months , range = 1 day – 10 . 42 years ; see 12 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 Figure 2 . 7 . : Percentages of diary milestones by developmental domain . About a third of diary milestones are devoted to motor development . Figure 2 . 8 . : The child ages ( 0 – 4 years ) for which milestones were reported . Figure 2 . 9 ) . Of course , the overall age of the child 4 is important to consider when understanding this diary age range . For example , a 6 month diary range for a 6 - month - old child covers 100 % of the child’s lifetime , whereas the same 6 month diary range for a 2 - year - old child covers only 25 % of the child’s lifetime . On average , the diary covered 56 . 32 % of the child’s lifetime ( median = 58 . 50 % , SD = 27 . 66 % , range = 1 . 08 – 100 % ; see Figure 2 . 10 ) . 4 We calculated a child’s overall age at the date of the last diary activity , thus preventing skewing from the children’s natural continuation of aging even after the parent has ceased or paused using the system to record milestones . Note the date of the last diary activity is always later than ( or occasionally , the same as ) the date of the last recorded milestone , as milestones are always recorded as having happened in the past ( or occasionally , the present day ) . 13 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 Figure 2 . 9 . : The range of time covered within a child’s diary . Figure 2 . 10 . : The percentage of a child’s life covered by his or her diary . 2 . 4 . 2 . Assessment of Objectivity Goal Internal Validity for Baby CROINC Percentiles Child development research ( detailed in the Baby CROINC section ) shows developmental dif - ferences between preterm children and full - term children , as well as between boys and girls . We analyzed Baby CROINC for these patterns . An independent samples t - test showed that preterm children ( deﬁned as being born before 37 weeks of gestation ) had signiﬁcantly lower me - dian percentiles , relative to full - term children , in the gross motor ( 22 % diﬀerence , t ( 305 ) = 4 . 10 , p ≤ 0 . 001 ) and social ( 17 % diﬀerence , t ( 238 ) = 2 . 70 , p = 0 . 008 ) domains . Independent samples t - tests for the developmental domains , indicated that girls had higher median percentiles than boys in the social domain ( 10 % diﬀerence , t ( 238 ) = 2 . 76 , p = . 006 ) . External Validity for Baby CROINC Percentiles For the 252 canonical milestone concepts in Baby CROINC which corresponded to published CDC milestones ( described previously in the System Initialization section ) , we investigated the average age diﬀerence between the published CDC ages and the children’s ages in CROINC for that milestone . 14 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 We expected a skew towards positive age diﬀerences—meaning the Baby CROINC milestone was achieved earlier ( at a younger age ) than the published CDC age . This is because the CDC age does not indicate the age at which the milestone was achieved ( as the Baby CROINC age does ) but rather the age by which the CDC recommends pediatricians start being concerned , if the milestone was not achieved anytime earlier . Additionally , CDC ages are purposefully published to correspond to typical well - baby visit ages ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 months and 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 years ) , which may not correspond to the milestone’s “natural” age range . On the other hand , any Baby CROINC children with developmental delays contribute towards a skew in the opposite direction . The results show that the median diﬀerence between the CDC age and the Baby CROINC age , across all milestones in all developmental domains , is 2 . 96 months ( SD = 8 . 40 months ) . See Figure 2 . 11 for age diﬀerences between CDC and Baby CROINC per domain . Spearman correlations were high ( r = 0 . 72 – 0 . 95 across domains ) and signiﬁcant ( p < 0 . 001 ) between the median age reported for milestones in Baby CROINC across children and the age cutoﬀ set by the CDC for corresponding milestones in each of the seven main developmental domains . Figure 2 . 11 . : Median age diﬀerence between Baby CROINC age and CDC age , per develop - mental domain . The age diﬀerence is between 2 . 29 and 6 . 05 months with more complex domains showing the largest gap 2 . 4 . 3 . Assessment of Curated Crowd Intelligence ( CCI ) Learning New Concepts Using the Crowd In exploratory research , the amount of meaningful collected data grows over time . Milestones reported by users in Baby CROINC are considered novel when they represent new canonical milestone concepts which didn’t previously exist in the system , as opposed to simply a diﬀerent language formulation of an existing context . For example , consider when a user adds a milestone like “David began to smile” when the “started smiling” canonical milestone concept already exists in the system—this does not add novel information to the system ( even though the exact language of the milestone is new ) . However , novel information is added when a user creates a “David began interacting with videoconferencing” if no prior “began interacting with videoconferencing” - like canonical milestone concept existed . After some minor language edits 15 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 from the expert curator , there is now a new canonical milestone concept in the system , available for other users to add to their own children’s diaries . As described in the User Activity Patterns section , the system was initialized with 252 canon - ical milestone concepts drawn from a published CDC list . Over time , user input increased the number of canonical milestone concepts in the system by 285 , to reach the current total of 537—i . e . , 238 % of the original number of canonical milestone concepts . Figure 2 . 12 shows that the amount of meaningful knowledge in the system grows steadily as the users interact with it , demonstrating that our system is able to harness crowd intelligence to extensively create new , meaningful insights . Of especial interest , the average slope of Figure 2 . 12 does not signiﬁcantly decrease or plateau over time . This indicates that the system has not yet reached a “saturation” point . As a result , we anticipate that there is still a signiﬁcant amount of childhood development milestone concepts that Baby CROINC has not yet captured . This evidence shows the importance of personalized , parent - authored and expert - curated recording systems like Baby CROINC , which greatly expand upon the existing knowledge base devised only by child development experts . Figure 2 . 12 . : Exploratory data accumulation over time . The ﬁgure shows the growth of canon - ical milestone concepts in the system over time as users interact with the system , relative to the amount the system had when initially launched . The growth does not appear to have plateaued to a maximum value , indicating even more concepts are likely to be added in the future . Making Milestone Statistics More Signiﬁcant Baby CROINC only shows its users statistics for milestones which have been recorded in the diaries of at least ﬁve children ; below this threshold we consider the statistics as essentially meaningless . Merging equivalent milestones together makes it possible to display signiﬁcant statistics , even when the data for each individual milestone text is relatively sparse . For exam - ple , if essentially identical milestones like “started walking” and “began to walk” were treated as separate canonical milestone concepts , instead of being merged through the CCI process , then only 12 . 80 % of milestones would contain enough data to provide users with signiﬁcant statistics . By grouping equivalent milestone texts as canonical milestone concepts , the number 16 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 of milestones which have signiﬁcant statistics increased to 68 . 35 % —an increase of 534 % . This emphasizes the value of the CCI process . Quantifying the Amount of Expert Curation Eﬀort Although very beneﬁcial to Baby CROINC’s ultimate quality , the CCI approach does add to the cost of running the system . To date , 1 , 013 milestone texts were created by the experts as clariﬁcations for new user milestone texts ( 46 % of all unique milestone texts in the system ) . In addition , 745 user - created milestones have been identiﬁed by the experts as equivalent to existing canonical milestone concepts . This level of curation requires regular review time by the trained expert team . Analysis of system logs shows that curator work amounts to 1 – 2 hours during normal weeks , and 6 – 8 hours during peak weeks ( e . g . , time spent translating content when native speakers of a new language are introduced to the system ) . During normal weeks , the amount of curation work has a linear relation to the amount of user - created milestones in the system ( R 2 = 0 . 977 ) . Assuming that user - created milestones are the main factor driving the need for expert curation , linear regression analysis shows that curators spend an average time of 4 minutes and 11 seconds ( ± 4 seconds ) on each user - created milestone . 17 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 3 . Collaborative Discovery : A Study of Guru – Follower Dynamics 3 . 1 . Introduction Aspiring gurus face the problem of attracting new followers , and retaining existing ones , as they journey together to a better future . This is an old problem . Moses , for instance , raised it before The Lord before assuming leadership of the Israelite Exodus from Egypt , asking : “What if they won’t believe me or listen to me ? What if they say , ’The Lord never appeared to you’ ? ” [ Exodus 4 : 1 ] . Many gurus resolve the problem by predicting unlikely events as a demonstration of their powers ; the Biblical Exodus story contains several such events ( culminating with the crossing of the Red Sea ) , all of which were predicted correctly by Moses . In today’s information society , crowd - based automated gurus gather data from users on a voluntary basis in order to produce meaningful insights . The quality of insights greatly depends on the amount and quality of data provided by the users , but those users have limited attention , giving rise to the study of attention economy [ Gol97 , Lan06 ] . By asking “interesting questions” and making “meaningful predictions” , an automated guru can retain users , but only if it “knows” how to ask “interesting” questions and provide “meaningful” feedback . The phenomenon that motivated this research is that of early child development ; the gurus are experts in this ﬁeld and the followers are parents of newborn babies [ BBJS17 ] . For the sake of concreteness we shall continue using this particular setting to describe our model but it may be conveniently replaced by the reader with physicians or psychologists playing the gurus as they interact with patients ( followers ) regarding a complex medical or mental problem , or with ﬁnancial advisors as gurus and their follower clientele . In these and similar settings , gurus and followers discuss a complex phenomenon that evolves over time , which the followers wish to understand , and about which the guru claims to have an advantage of “wisdom” over them . The main contribution of this paper is a mathematical model which explains why “smarter” gurus tend to retain a larger following , in a way that is compatible with the incentives of both gurus and followers . A clean mathematical model sheds light on the studied phenomena and may facilitate the future design of more eﬃcient and successful automated gurus . Roadmap As the introduction is long , here is a roadmap to it : Section 3 . 1 . 1 includes a formal description of the model . In Section 3 . 1 . 2 , we discuss the concept of retentive scoring , which allows us to describe the collaborative discovery process in an incentive compatible way , taking agent rationality into account . Section 3 . 1 . 3 adds the layer of limited memory span to character - ize the discrepancies between the guru and follower , and between fellow gurus . In Section 3 . 1 . 4 , we demonstrate the diﬀerent properties of the model by analyzing its behavior in the universe of linear spaces . Section 3 . 1 . 5 reviews the latest related work , and ﬁnally Section 4 . 2 summarizes the main contributions and questions to be explored in the future . 18 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 3 . 1 . 1 . The Collaborative Discovery model The phenomenon about which the guru and her followers interact is modeled by a distribution T over X Γ , where Γ is the set of properties manifested by the phenomenon and X is an arbitrary input space . The two input spaces mentioned in this paper are the binary space X = { 0 , 1 } and the ﬁnite categorical space X = { 0 , . . . , n } . In the context of childhood development , Γ is the set of developmental milestones like “ﬁrst smile” , and each follower ( associated , for simplicity , with a parent of a single child ) is represented by a sample u ∈ X Γ that describes the ages at which that child achieved each milestone . By time t , the follower discloses to the guru u (cid:23) Γ t , the restriction of her sample u to a subset Γ t ⊆ Γ . Additional attributes of u may be revealed later in time , others might be disclosed by the followed if prompted to do so , while certain attributes will remain forever latent . The follower seeks the guru’s assistance in predicting “meaningful information” that is cur - rently unknown to the follower . The guru and follower interact over a number of rounds but the follower will terminate the interaction if the guru is judged to be unhelpful ( in a manner formalized below ) . During each round of interaction , the guru makes a prediction by announc - ing a distribution P γ t over X that she claims is the true one for a latent attribute γ t (cid:54)∈ Γ t ; the follower has a distribution Q γ that she believes corresponds to γ t . ( Modern gurus and followers are comfortable discussing probabilities rather than predicting a single event as is the case with pre - election polling results . ) The way γ t is selected from Γ \ Γ t and its eﬀect on the process is left to future work . The follower now queries γ t and reports the true value , denoted u γ t , which is derived from Nature’s “true” distribution . After each round the follower updates the strength of her retention by the guru . We assume this strength is given by a retention parameter r t that starts with a ﬁxed value r 0 and varies with time ; once r t turns negative the follower will be said to have lost all faith in the guru and therefore terminate the interaction . The main objective of the guru is to maintain r t ≥ 0 for all t ≥ 0 ; jumping ahead , a distribution T for which there exists a guru that , in expectation , manages to retain followers to eternity ( or until t = | Γ | for ﬁnite Γ ) will be said to be r 0 - retainable and the retention complexity of T will be the minimal r 0 such that T is r 0 - retainable ( see Deﬁnitions 3 . 1 . 5 , 3 . 1 . 6 ) . When the user updates her retention parameter at the end of round t , she uses a function S ( · , · , · ) that is real - valued and takes three inputs : ( i ) the guru’s predicted distribution P γ t ; ( ii ) the follower’s assessment of that distribution Q γ t ; and ( iii ) the value u γ t that materialized , sampled by Nature . The retention parameter at time t is given by r t = r t − 1 + S ( P γ t , Q γ t , u γ t ) ( 3 . 1 . 1 ) Remark 3 . 1 . 1 ( Simplifying assumptions ) . The formula ( 3 . 1 . 1 ) makes the following assump - tions on the follower’s update rule : that it is Markovian , uses r t − 1 additively and does not depend on the follower’s identity nor on the identity of the attribute γ t being predicted . Such assumptions are common when modeling human behavior and we leave the study of more general update functions to future work . 3 . 1 . 2 . Retentive scoring rules The deﬁnition of the function S above , and the surprising corollaries of this deﬁnition , are what dominates the ﬁrst part of our study . We assume S belongs to a class of functions that elicit the true beliefs of both guru and follower regarding the distribution for the attribute γ t . Truth eliciting rules are ones that incentivize ( rational ) players to supply the rule with what they believe to be the truth . A famous early example of a truth eliciting rule is that of a one - party 19 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 proper scoring rule , which will be tightly related to our two - party retentive scoring rule S , so we start with the simpler , one - party , case . Proper ( one - party ) Scoring Rules One - party proper scoring rules are used to compensate a single forecaster of Nature in a truth - eliciting manner ; these rules are studied extensively in the Decision Theory literature [ McC56 , Sav71 , GR07 ] and have interesting connections to the ﬁelds of estimation , information theory , and machine learning ; see [ DM14 ] for a recent survey . A scoring rule receives a single forecast , which is a distribution P over X as an input ( say , this could be the temperature at noon tomorrow at a ﬁxed location ) , and scores the forecaster based on the outcome selected by Nature ( the actual temperature ) . A scoring rule is called proper if it is maximized by forecasting the true distribution . We recite the deﬁnition as it appears in [ Sav71 , GR07 ] : Deﬁnition 3 . 1 . 1 ( Proper Scoring Rule ) . Let P be a convex set of distributions over an arbitrary input space X . A ( one - party ) scoring rule is a function s : P × X → R . The scoring rule s is proper with respect to P if , for all R ∈ P ( viewed as Nature’s true distribution ) , the expected score E x ∼ R [ s ( P , x ) ] is maximized over P ∈ P at P = R : ∀ P ∈ P E x ∼ R [ s ( P , x ) ] ≤ E x ∼ R [ s ( R , x ) ] ( 3 . 1 . 2 ) Intuitively , when the agent forecasts a distribution P ∈ P and event x ∈ X materializes , the reward for the expert is s ( P , x ) . To increase clarity when one - party and two - party ( retentive ) scoring rules are involved , we will use a lowercase s to denote a proper ( one - party ) scoring rule , and a calligraphic S to denote a retentive ( two - party ) one . Many proper scoring rules can be constructed using elementary functions , for example the logarithmic scoring rule : s ( P , i ) = log p i ( 3 . 1 . 3 ) and Brier’s scoring rule [ Bri50 ] : s ( P , i ) = 2 p i − (cid:88) j p 2 j = 2 p i − (cid:107) P (cid:107) 22 ( 3 . 1 . 4 ) Retentive ( two - party ) scoring rules In the spirit of proper scoring rules , we deﬁne a retentive scoring rule which involves two parties : guru and follower . Using an axiomatic approach , we start by deﬁning the desired properties of such a rule : Deﬁnition 3 . 1 . 2 ( Retentive Scoring Rule ) . Let P be a convex set of distributions over an arbitrary input space X . A function S : P × P × X → R is called a retentive scoring rule if it satisﬁes the following conditions : 1 . Cost of ignorance : For all distributions P ∈ P and outcomes x ∈ X , S ( P , P , x ) = − 1 ( 3 . 1 . 5 ) 2 . Proper scorings : for any distribution R ∈ P dictated by Nature : a ) Guru - side : For any ﬁxed follower belief Q ∈ P , the best guru prediction P ∈ P is Nature’s : E x ∼ R [ S ( P , Q , x ) ] ≤ E x ∼ R [ S ( R , Q , x ) ] ( 3 . 1 . 6 ) 20 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 b ) Follower - side : For any ﬁxed guru prediction P ∈ P , the best follower belief Q ∈ P is Nature’s : E x ∼ R [ S ( P , Q , x ) ] ≥ E x ∼ R [ S ( P , R , x ) ] ( 3 . 1 . 7 ) Intuitively , the cost of ignorance condition models the “attention economy” cost of interaction , and captures the intuition that the follower will penalize gurus that are no “smarter” than he is . For example , no guru / meteorologist will get followers by predicting “100 % chance of sun in the Sahara desert” . The predictions must be surprising to the followers . In the formal deﬁnition , the penalty constant is normalized to − 1 to simplify analysis . The output of S is a quantity that the guru wishes to maximize , because doing so will mean the follower is retained longer , as seen by Equation ( 3 . 1 . 1 ) . Therefore , the guru - side properness requirement ( Equation ( 3 . 1 . 6 ) ) implies that a rational guru will strive to report the correct distribution used by Nature ( R ) , if the guru knows that distribution . In other words , we require the scoring rule to elicit truthful guru - side inputs . Similarly , since the follower has a limited attention span , she is incentivized to judge the guru’s quality “honestly” , and this is modeled by the follower - side properness condition ( Equa - tion ( 3 . 1 . 7 ) ) ; it means the follower too will supply the rule S with Nature’s distribution , if known to her . Notice that the combination of the cost - of - ignorance and two properness results mean that a rational guru will not oﬀer “obvious advice” about which both guru and follower “know the ( same ) truth” . Retentive Rule Construction One - party scoring rules give rise to two - party retentive scor - ing rules in a straightforward way : Score the guru and follower separately based on Nature’s outcome using , perhaps , two diﬀerent functions , and deﬁne the retentive score as the diﬀer - ence between the one - party scores minus a ﬁxed constant ( to account for the cost - of - ignorance ( 3 . 1 . 5 ) ) . A retentive scoring rule of this form is said to be separable , and a special case is that of a symmetric rule , in which both guru and follower are scored using the same ( one - party ) scoring rule , formally : Deﬁnition 3 . 1 . 3 ( Symmetric Retentive Scoring Rule ) . A retentive scoring rule S : P×P×X → R is called symmetric if there exists a proper one - party scoring rule s : P × X → R such that : S ( P , Q , i ) = s ( P , i ) − s ( Q , i ) − 1 ( 3 . 1 . 8 ) Characterization Restricting the discussion to categorical distributions , i . e . , to cases where X is ﬁnite , and assuming the retentive scoring rules are analytic , meaning that a uniformly convergent power series expansion exists about any P ∈ P , our ﬁrst main result is the following statement : Theorem 3 . 1 . 1 ( Retentive Scoring Rules are Symmetric ) . The function S : P × P × X → R is an analytic retentive scoring rule for categorical distributions if and only if there exists a proper and analytic scoring rule s : P × X → R such that : S ( P , Q , x ) = s ( P , x ) − s ( Q , x ) − 1 ( 3 . 1 . 9 ) We ﬁnd the statement somewhat surprising because it is not intuitively clear that a two - party retentive rule must be separable ; symmetry follows rather directly from separability and the cost - of - ignorance assumption . For the proof — given in Section 3 . 2 — we use a known result which relates proper scoring rules to convex functions over the probability simplex . We show 21 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 that each retentive scoring rule corresponds to a solution of a system of partial diﬀerential equations ( PDEs ) . Solving the system and characterizing the family of solutions yields the result ( see Section 3 . 2 . 2 ) . 3 . 1 . 3 . Memory Span To model the diﬀerent prediction capacities of gurus and followers , the forecasting abilities of both types of agents in the Collaborative Discovery model are characterized by a parameter called memory span , deﬁned below . A variety of psychological studies could be summarized by saying that the human short - term memory has a capacity of about “seven , plus - or - minus two” chunks , where each chunk can be roughly deﬁned as a collection of elementary information relating to a single con - cept [ Mil56 , TC00 ] . What counts as a chunk depends on the knowledge of the person being tested . For instance , a word is a single chunk for a speaker of the language but is many chunks for someone who is totally unfamiliar with the language and sees the word as a collection of phonetic segments . In the world of child development , young parents ( who usually don’t have signiﬁcant expe - rience or formal child - development education ) are likely to predict that their child will start walking around the average time for the entire population . Child development experts , on the other hand , usually have better ability to pick up subtle developmental signals from observed child behavior , and provide a better prediction based on them . In this spirit , we proceed with the formal deﬁnition . In what follows , let ∆ (cid:0) X Γ (cid:1) denote the simplex of probability distributions over X Γ and ∆ ( X ) is the simplex of distributions over X . Deﬁnition 3 . 1 . 4 ( Memory Span ) . Let T ∈ ∆ (cid:0) X Γ (cid:1) be a distribution . An agent is said to have memory span m ≥ 0 when its prediction P γ ∈ ∆ ( X ) for coordinate γ t ∈ Γ of an instance u ∈ X Γ with disclosed parameters Γ t ⊆ Γ ( i . e . for which u (cid:23) Γ t is known ) is based on m disclosed coordinates or less : ∀ γ ∈ Γ , ∃ I t ⊆ Γ t : | I t | ≤ m , P γ = ( T γ | u (cid:23) I t ) ( 3 . 1 . 10 ) where ( T γ | u (cid:23) I t ) is the marginal distribution of T on coordinate γ , conditioned on the event that the coordinates I t are set to u (cid:23) I t . Intuitively , this means that every prediction of an agent is based on its entire knowledge of at most m coordinates . When m = 0 , a prediction is only based on the marginal distribution of the corresponding parameter in the entire population . Monotonicity Our second result , stated next , says that if guru G is “smarter” than guru G (cid:48) , meaning her memory span ( m g ) is greater than his ( m (cid:48) g ) , the smarter guru G will also have higher success in retaining followers , in expectation . ( Whether this optimistic result holds in the real world is highly debatable . ) This result is not implied directly by the deﬁnition of the Collaborative Discovery model , and shows that our model exhibits intuitive and desirable properties that substantiate its theoretical appeal : Theorem 3 . 1 . 2 ( Knowledgeable Gurus Retain Better ) . Let S : P × P × X → R be an analytic retentive scoring rule , let G 1 , G 2 be two gurus with memory spans m ( 1 ) g ≥ m ( 2 ) g . Then for any distribution T , any coordinate x , and follower with memory span m f ≤ m ( 2 ) g : E T [ S ( P 1 , Q , x ) ] ≥ E T [ S ( P 2 , Q , x ) ] ( 3 . 1 . 11 ) 22 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 where P 1 , P 2 ∈ ∆ ( X ) are the distributional forecasts of gurus G 1 and G 2 respectively , and Q ∈ ∆ ( X ) is the belief of the follower . A technical discussion of the theorem and its proof are provided in Section 3 . 3 . Retainability as a function of memory span discrepancy From here on we assume that the guru has memory span m g , and her follower has memory span m f and moreoever , both parties provide to the retentive scoring rule a distribution that is the correct marginal T γ t | u (cid:23) J t , conditioned on some subset of J t ⊂ Γ t of size m g for the guru and m f for the follower , respectively . Under this assumption , notice that if m g = m f then both parties supply the same distribution , so the cost - of - ignorance assumption of Deﬁnition 3 . 1 . 2 means the follower will terminate the interaction within r 0 steps ; in other words , ignorant gurus will not prevail . Henceforth assume m g > m f . Combining the concepts of limited user attention , retentive scoring , and limited memory span , we can now ask : Is it possible for the guru to retain her follower throughout the process ? This leads to the concept of retainablility : Deﬁnition 3 . 1 . 5 ( Retainable Distribution ) . Let T ∈ ∆ (cid:0) X Γ (cid:1) , and assume | Γ | = n . Given a retentive scoring rule S : P × P × X → R , guru memory span m g ≥ 0 , follower memory span m f ≥ 0 , and an initial retention parameter r 0 > 0 , we say that T is retentively learnable with respect to ( S , m g , m f , r 0 ) if there exists an ordering γ 1 , . . . , γ n of of Γ , and a sequence of sets I 1 , . . . , I n such for all t ∈ [ n ] : 1 . I t ⊆ { γ 1 , . . . , γ t − 1 } 2 . | I t | ≤ m g 3 . For every sequence of sets J 1 , . . . , J n such that J t ⊆ { γ 1 , . . . , γ t − 1 } , | J t | ≤ m f : r t = r 0 + t (cid:88) t (cid:48) = 1 S (cid:0)(cid:0) T γ t (cid:48) | u (cid:23) I t (cid:48) (cid:1) , (cid:0) T γ t (cid:48) | u (cid:23) J t (cid:48) (cid:1) , T (cid:1) ≥ 0 ( 3 . 1 . 12 ) Intuitively , a probability distribution is retainable when it is possible to maintain a positive retention parameter throughout the process . From ( 3 . 1 . 12 ) we can see that increasing r 0 does not hurt retainability . In other words , for r (cid:48) 0 > r 0 , if a distribution is retainable with respect to ( S , m g , m f , r 0 ) , then it is also retainable for ( S , m g , m f , r (cid:48) 0 ) . We know that attention is a very limited resource , so we cannot expect it to be arbitrarily large . This leads to the following question : How large should the “initial retention” be in order for the guru to sustain her follower throughout the collaborative discovery process ? Deﬁnition 3 . 1 . 6 ( Retention Complexity ) . The retention complexity of a distribution T ∈ ∆ (cid:0) X Γ (cid:1) with respect to ( S , m g , m f ) is the minimal value of r 0 such that T is retainable : r S , m g , m f ( T ) = min { r 0 | T is retainable with respect to ( S , m g , m f , r 0 ) } ( 3 . 1 . 13 ) 3 . 1 . 4 . The retention complexity of linear spaces To initiate the study of the retention complexity of speciﬁc distribution , a class of simple - to - understand , but non - trivial distributions , is needed . Uniform distributions over linear spaces are such a family and the object of discussion next . While such distributions are far from ones appearing in the “real world” , studying them in this context provide convenient tools and 23 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 insights about the Collaborative Discovery model , and the intuition and techniques we develop here will be generalized as we move to more “applied” settings . Our limited scope is inspired by other initial works , like that of Valiant which studied machine learning in the “restricted , but nontrivial context” of boolean functions [ Val84 ] and that of Goldreich , Goldwasser and Ron that studied property testing in the context of graph properties [ GGR98 ] . Consider a realization of the model in which each attribute ranges over a binary space , i . e . , X Γ = { 0 , 1 } n . The Binary Attributes model describes a universe where each attribute is either present or not for a given user . Restricting our scope to binary attributes makes it possible to use the rich frameworks of locally testable codes ( LTCs ) and Property Testing [ GGR98 ] to draw theoretic conclusions and build intuition . We start by redeﬁning the problem using ﬁnite - ﬁeld linear algebra , and then study the retention complexity of several natural families of linear codes , including the Walsh - Hadamard codes and the family of random Low Density Parity Check ( LDPC ) codes . In particular , identify { 0 , 1 } with the two - element ﬁnite ﬁeld F 2 and consider a uniform distribution U over a linear space U ⊆ F n 2 . Let U ⊥ denote the space dual to U . Let d ( U ) denote the Hamming distance of U ( and d ( U ⊥ ) is its dual distance ) , recalling that distance is equal to the minimum Hamming weight of a non - zero word in U ( or U ⊥ , respectively ) . We assume the guru has inﬁnite memory span and the follower has memory span 0 . ( The study of the general case of 0 < m f < m g < ∞ is left for future work . ) This means the follower’s distribution for each i ∈ [ n ] is the uniform distribution on F 2 ( this assumes U is not constant on any i ∈ [ n ] ) . We shall use a retentive scoring rule denoted S bin , that has expected value 1 when the guru can predict the next coordinate exactly , i . e . , when the value of that coordinate depends linearly on the values of coordinates exposed thus far , and gives expected value − 1 otherwise , when the distribution on that coordinate is linearly independent of all previously revealed bits . The following result sets the bounds for our study of retention complexity in this setting : Lemma 3 . 1 . 1 ( Retention Complexity Bounds for Linear Spaces ) . For a uniform distribution U over a linear space U ⊆ F 2 n with unbounded guru memory span and zero follower memory span , the retention complexity satisﬁes : d (cid:16) U ⊥ (cid:17) − 1 ≤ r ( S bin , ∞ , 0 ) ( U ) ≤ dim ( U ) ( 3 . 1 . 14 ) Next , we show that the both bounds are tight . We begin by showing that a uniform distribu - tion over codewords of the Walsh - Hadamard ( WH ) code achieves the lower retention complexity bound : Lemma 3 . 1 . 2 ( Walsh - Hadamard Retention Complexity ) . For all k ∈ N , a k - dimensional Walsh - Hadamard code satisﬁes : r ( S bin , ∞ , 0 ) ( WH ) = 2 ( 3 . 1 . 15 ) Finally , we show that a random LDPC code achieves the upper bound ( up to multiplicative constants ) with high probability : Theorem 3 . 1 . 3 ( LDPC Retention Complexity ) . For a proper choice of constants c , d > 0 and suﬃciently large n , the retention complexity of a random ( c , d ) - regular LDPC code over F n 2 is linear with high probability : r ( S bin , ∞ , 0 ) ( LDPC ) = w . h . p Ω ( dim ( LDPC ) ) ( 3 . 1 . 16 ) The proofs of these results are provided in Section 3 . 4 . 2 , the most technically challenging one is the third one and relies on the lower bounds for the testability of random LDPC codes of [ BHR05 ] . 24 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 3 . 1 . 5 . Related work The study of reputation systems is interested in ranking gurus in “meaningful” ways , and is highly investigated empirically and theoretically ; cf . [ RKZF00 , RZ02 ] and references therein . Closest in rigour to our approach are the papers by ( i ) Ban and Linial [ BL11 ] which uses the theory of random processes to identify situations where gurus ( called “experts” there ) can be robustly ranked , assuming user participation continues indeﬁnitely , and ( ii ) Chan et al . [ CKY09 ] that classiﬁes interactive crowd - computation games using a small list of modeling parameters . In the context of machine learning , the task of detecting users who are likely to stop par - ticipating in a voluntary system is known as churn prediction . For this task , machine learning algorithms are trained to recognize typical usage patterns and predict the likelihood of a termi - nation [ WC02 , DPRS12 ] . Even though general machine learning models provide good “black - box” churn predictors when trained correctly , gaining deep understanding of the underlying phenomena might be challenging . Comparing our model to prior work , there are two main diﬀerences . First , our aim is to model the dynamics of long - term interaction between a follower and her guru about a single complex phenomenon of interest , asking when do followers abandon their gurus . Second , we are interested in the mathematical properties of phenomena that are prone to collaborative discovery , meaning that for these phenomena a “good” guru will successfully instruct her followers from start to end without losing their attention and faith . This motivation is somewhat similar to that taken in the ﬁeld of Property Testing [ GGR98 ] which attempts to understand which properties are amenable to “testing” . 3 . 2 . Retentive Scoring In this section we study retentive scoring rules , and prove Theorem 3 . 1 . 1 . 3 . 2 . 1 . Preliminaries and Notations Categorical Probability Distributions Recall that a categorical distribution is a discrete prob - ability distribution that describes the possible results of a random event that can take one of K possible outcomes . In this section , we assume P is a convex set of categorical distributions with K = ( n + 1 ) possible outcomes , i . e . X = { 0 , . . . , n } . We deﬁne the number of possible outcomes as n + 1 instead of n to simplify later calculations . In addition , recall that the space of categorical distributions with ( n + 1 ) possible outcomes is equivalent to the n - dimensional simplex : P ⊆ ∆ n = (cid:40) ( p 0 , . . . , p n ) ∈ R n + 1 | (cid:88) i p i = 1 ; ∀ i : p i ≥ 0 (cid:41) ( 3 . 2 . 1 ) where p i is the probability of categorical event i . Expected Score Notation Recall Deﬁnition 3 . 1 . 2 . Following the conventions of the proper scoring literature , and given probability distributions P , Q , R ∈ P , we denote the expected retentive score as : S ( P , Q , R ) ≡ E i ∼ R [ S ( P , Q , i ) ] ( 3 . 2 . 2 ) To avoid diﬃculties in ( 3 . 2 . 2 ) , we will assume S ( P , Q , R ) exists and is ﬁnite . Similarly , for one - party scoring rules , the common notation of expected score is : s ( P , R ) ≡ E i ∼ R [ s ( P , i ) ] ( 3 . 2 . 3 ) 25 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 The analysis below will use both the single event notation S ( P , Q , i ) and the expected score notation S ( P , Q , R ) ( and similarly for one - party scoring rules ) . To avoid confusion , we will always use upper - case letters to denote random variables and lower - case letters to denote events . Remark 3 . 2 . 1 ( Scoring Rules on Inﬁnite Sample Spaces ) . Similar to proper ( one - party ) scor - ing rules , it is possible to deﬁne retentive scoring rules on inﬁnite sample spaces using measure - theoretic tools . Computers are ﬁnite , and therefore many applications can be modeled as ﬁnite - dimensional categorical distributions . In this work we consider the ﬁnite sample space for con - creteness and simplicity , and leave the rigorous measure - theoretic analysis to future work . Characterization of Proper Scoring Rules One of the fundamental results in the research of proper scoring rules is the characterization theorem , ﬁrst stated by [ McC56 ] , which deﬁnes a correspondence between proper scoring rules and convex functions over the probability simplex . We start with some preliminary deﬁnitions , and proceed with the characterization theorem itself : Deﬁnition 3 . 2 . 1 ( Subgradient ) . A function ∇ ∗ G : P → R n + 1 is a subgradient of G at the point P if the following inequality holds for all Q ∈ P : G ( Q ) ≥ G ( P ) + (cid:104)∇ ∗ G ( P ) , ( Q − P ) (cid:105) ( 3 . 2 . 4 ) where (cid:104)· , ·(cid:105) denotes the euclidean inner product over R n + 1 : (cid:104) X , Y (cid:105) = (cid:80) ni = 0 x i y i . Remark 3 . 2 . 2 ( Subgradients of Diﬀerentiable Functions ) . If G is diﬀerentiable at P ∈ P then G has a unique subgradient at P and it equals the gradient ∇ G = (cid:16) ∂G∂p 0 , . . . , ∂G∂p n (cid:17) at P . Recall that a real - valued function G : P → R is convex if : G ( ( 1 − λ ) P + λQ ) ≤ ( 1 − λ ) G ( P ) + λG ( Q ) for all P , Q ∈ P and λ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] . Lemma 3 . 2 . 1 ( [ HB71 ] , Theorem 2 . 1 ) . G : P → R is convex if and only if it has a subgradient ∇ ∗ G at each point P ∈ P . Theorem 3 . 2 . 1 ( McCarthy’s Theorem , [ GR07 ] ) . A scoring rule s : P × Ω → R is proper relative to P if and only if there exists a convex , real - valued function G on P such that : s ( P , i ) = G ( P ) − (cid:104)∇ ∗ G ( P ) , P (cid:105) − ( ∇ ∗ G ) i ( 3 . 2 . 5 ) where ( ∇ ∗ G ) i is the i th component of ( ∇ ∗ G ) . We also deﬁne the Generalized Entropy as the convex function which is induced by the proper scoring rule : Deﬁnition 3 . 2 . 2 ( Generalized Entropy ) . The convex function G ( P ) = s ( P , P ) induced by a proper scoring rule s is called the generalized entropy function of s . Note that a convex general entropy function exists for every proper scoring rule by Theo - rem 3 . 2 . 1 . For the logarithmic scoring rule deﬁned in ( 3 . 1 . 3 ) , the associated general entropy function is the additive inverse of the Shannon entropy : G ( P ) = (cid:80) ni = 0 p i log p i . Additional information - theoretic quantities can be generalized using proper scoring rules . See [ DM14 ] for a recent review . 26 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 3 . 2 . 2 . Separability of Retentive Scoring Rules In this section , we prove that every proper retentive scoring rule can be written as the diﬀerence between two proper scoring rules . Recall Theorem 3 . 1 . 1 : Theorem 3 . 1 . 1 ( Retentive Scoring Rules are Symmetric ) . The function S : P × P × X → R is an analytic retentive scoring rule for categorical distributions if and only if there exists a proper and analytic scoring rule s : P × X → R such that : S ( P , Q , x ) = s ( P , x ) − s ( Q , x ) − 1 ( 3 . 1 . 9 ) The proof has several steps : 1 . We verify that symmetric retentive scoring rules are indeed proper ( Lemma 3 . 2 . 2 ) . 2 . Conversely , we ﬁrst deﬁne the notion of a separable scoring rule , which is a rule which can be written as the diﬀerence between two one - party scoring rules . Given a retentive scoring rule , we use the proper scoring characterization theorem ( Theorem 3 . 2 . 1 ) to construct a system of partial diﬀerential equations which describes the constraints that must be satisﬁed by such a rule ( Lemma 3 . 2 . 3 ) . We then solve the characterizing system of partial diﬀerential equations ( Claim 3 . 2 . 1 ) , and show that every possible solution corresponds to a separable retentive scoring rule ( Lemma 3 . 2 . 4 ) . 3 . Finally , we show that every separable retentive scoring rule with constant cost of ignorance is also symmetric , proving the theorem . We proceed by stating and proving the lemmas , and conclude the section by proving the theorem itself . Preliminaries The proofs of Lemma 3 . 2 . 2 and Lemma 3 . 2 . 3 rely on the formalism of proper scoring rules and retentive scoring rules . The proof of Claim 3 . 2 . 1 relies on basic results from the theory of quasi - linear partial diﬀerential equations ( refer to [ PR05 ] for a thorough introduction ) . For D ⊆ R n , we will refer to a function f : D → R as analytic if its Taylor expansion about x ∈ D converges to f ( x ) for all x ∈ D . We use e i ∈ R n to denote the i th vector of the standard basis . The gradient of a diﬀerentiable function g ( x , y ) : R n × R n → R with respect to x ∈ R n is denoted by ∂g∂ x ≡ (cid:16) ∂g∂x 1 , . . . , ∂g∂x n (cid:17) T . Symmetric Rules are Retentive Lemma 3 . 2 . 2 . Let S : P × P × X → R be a scoring rule . If there is a proper scoring rule s : P × X → R such that : S ( P , Q , i ) = s ( P , i ) − s ( Q , i ) − 1 , then S ( P , Q , i ) is retentive . Proof . Let P , Q , R ∈ P . Using ( 3 . 1 . 8 ) , the expected score S ( P , Q , R ) is : S ( P , Q , R ) = s ( P , R ) − s ( Q , R ) − 1 ( 3 . 2 . 6 ) s is proper , and therefore s ( P , R ) ≤ s ( R , R ) . Plugging into ( 3 . 2 . 6 ) we obtain : S ( P , Q , R ) ≤ s 1 ( R , R ) − s 2 ( Q , R ) = S ( R , Q , R ) ( 3 . 2 . 7 ) satisfying ( 3 . 1 . 6 ) . Similarly , s 2 is also proper , and therefore : S ( P , Q , R ) ≥ s 1 ( P , R ) − s 2 ( R , R ) = S ( P , R , R ) ( 3 . 2 . 8 ) satisfying ( 3 . 1 . 6 ) . For Q = P we get S ( P , P , i ) = − 1 for all i ∈ X , and therefore S is retentive according to Deﬁnition 3 . 1 . 2 . 27 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 Retentive Rules are Separable We start by formally deﬁning the notion of a separable scoring rule : Deﬁnition 3 . 2 . 3 ( Separable Retentive Scoring Rule ) . A proper retentive scoring rule S : P × P × Ω → R is called separable if there exists two proper scoring rules s 1 , s 2 : P × Ω → R such that : S ( P , Q , i ) = s 1 ( P , i ) − s 2 ( Q , i ) ( 3 . 2 . 9 ) We also say that a two - party scoring rule is proper if it satisﬁes ( 3 . 1 . 6 ) , ( 3 . 1 . 7 ) . In the following lemma , we say that a bi - variate function G : P × P → R is convex with respect to its ﬁrst argument if G ( P , Q ) is a convex function of P for any constant Q ∈ P ; convexity with respect to the second argument is similarly deﬁned by switching the roles of P and Q . Lemma 3 . 2 . 3 ( Characterization by subgradients ) . A two - party scoring rule S is proper with respect to class P if and only if there exist two functions G , H : P × P → R such that : 1 . G ( P , Q ) is convex with respect to P . 2 . H ( P , Q ) is convex with respect to Q . 3 . For all P , Q , R ∈ P : G + (cid:104)∇ ∗ P G , ( R − P ) (cid:105) = − (cid:0) H + (cid:10) ∇ ∗ Q H , ( R − Q ) (cid:11)(cid:1) ( 3 . 2 . 10 ) where ∇ ∗ P G is a subgradient of G ( P , Q ) with respect to its ﬁrst argument , and ∇ ∗ Q H is a subgradient of H ( P , Q ) with respect to its second argument . Proof . For the ﬁrst direction , let S ( P , Q , i ) be a proper retentive scoring rule , and deﬁne s Q ( P , i ) ≡ S ( P , Q , i ) . Using ( 3 . 1 . 6 ) we obtain that s Q ( P , R ) ≤ s Q ( R , R ) . Therefore s Q is proper , and according to Theorem 3 . 2 . 1 there exists a convex function G Q : P → R that depends on Q , such that : s Q ( P , i ) = G Q ( P ) − (cid:104)∇ ∗ G Q ( P ) , P (cid:105) + ( ∇ ∗ G Q ( P ) ) i ( 3 . 2 . 11 ) where ( ∇ ∗ G Q ( P ) ) i is i th entry of ∇ ∗ G Q at point P . Similarly , deﬁne s P ( Q , i ) ≡ S ( P , Q , i ) . By the same reasoning and using ( 3 . 1 . 7 ) we obtain that − s P is proper , and therefore there exists a convex function H P : P → R such that : − s P ( Q , i ) = H P ( Q ) − (cid:104)∇ ∗ H P ( Q ) , Q (cid:105) + ( ∇ ∗ H P ( Q ) ) i ( 3 . 2 . 12 ) Deﬁne G ( P , Q ) ≡ G Q ( P ) and H ( P , Q ) ≡ H P ( Q ) . Note that G is convex with respect to P and H is convex with respect to Q , satisfying conditions 1 , 2 . Let R ∈ P . Using the fact that s P ( P , R ) = s Q ( Q , R ) , we can combine ( 3 . 2 . 11 ) , ( 3 . 2 . 12 ) to obtain : G + (cid:104)∇ ∗ P G , ( R − P ) (cid:105) = − (cid:0) H + (cid:10) ∇ ∗ Q H , ( R − Q ) (cid:11)(cid:1) ( 3 . 2 . 13 ) satisfying condition 3 . Conversely , let G , H be the functions which satisfy the three conditions above . Deﬁne : s Q ( P , i ) ≡ G − (cid:104)∇ ∗ P G , P (cid:105) + ( ∇ ∗ P G ) i ( 3 . 2 . 14 ) s P ( Q , i ) ≡ − (cid:16) H − (cid:10) ∇ ∗ Q H , H (cid:11) + (cid:0) ∇ ∗ Q H (cid:1) i (cid:17) ( 3 . 2 . 15 ) Note that s Q = − s P by equation ( 3 . 2 . 10 ) , and that s P and − s Q are proper by Theorem 3 . 2 . 1 . Deﬁne S ( P , Q , i ) = s Q ( P , i ) = − s P ( Q , i ) . s Q is proper , and therefore S ( P , Q , R ) ≤ S ( R , Q , R ) , satisfying the properness condition in ( 3 . 1 . 6 ) . Similarly , the properness of − s P implies S ( P , R , R ) ≤ S ( P , Q , R ) , satisfying ( 3 . 1 . 7 ) , and therefore S is proper . 28 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 The following lemma contains a solution of a partial diﬀerential equation that will assist us in solving the characterizing equations of proper retentive scoring rules . We obtain the solution using basic tools from the theory of partial diﬀerential equations , and the proof is given in Section A . 1 for completeness : Claim 3 . 2 . 1 . Let D ⊆ R n such that x , y ∈ D . For every analytic function u : D × D → R satisfying the equation u ( x , y ) − n (cid:88) i = 1 ( y i − x i ) ∂u ( x , y ) ∂x i = 0 ( 3 . 2 . 16 ) there exist functions α 1 , . . . , α n : D → R such that : u ( x , y ) = n (cid:88) i = 1 α i ( y ) ( y i − x i ) ( 3 . 2 . 17 ) The following lemma is the heart of this part of the proof of Theorem 3 . 1 . 1 . Lemma 3 . 2 . 4 ( Proper Retentive Rules are Separable ) . Let S : P × P × X → R be a retentive scoring rule . If S is a proper retentive scoring rule with analytic generalized entropy functions , then there exist two functions s 1 , s 2 : P × Ω → R such that S ( P , Q , i ) = s 1 ( P , i ) − s 2 ( Q , i ) . Proof outline : 1 . Given a proper retentive scoring rule , Lemma 3 . 2 . 3 implies the existence of two generalized entropy functions G , H : P × P → R related by equation ( 3 . 2 . 10 ) . 2 . We choose a parametrization for points on the simplex ∆ n , and use it to deﬁne ( 3 . 2 . 10 ) in the convex domain D = (cid:8) ( x 1 , . . . , x n ) ∈ R n + | (cid:80) i x i ≤ 1 (cid:9) . 3 . We simplify the resulting equation , and solve it using Claim 3 . 2 . 1 . 4 . Applying the correspondence established in Theorem 3 . 2 . 1 between convex functions on the simplex and proper scoring rules , we show that the generalized entropy functions G , H induce a separable scoring rule . Following the conventions of multivariate calculus , in the proof we will use the · symbol to denote the euclidean inner product over R n : x · y = (cid:80) ni = 1 x i y i . In addition , the proof employs terms from the theory of multivariate convex analysis : Given a non - empty convex subset S ⊆ R n , its aﬃne hull Aﬀ ( S ) is the smallest aﬃne set containing S . A relative interior point is a member of the set { x ∈ S : ∃ (cid:15) > 0 , N (cid:15) ( x ) ∩ Aﬀ ( S ) ⊆ S } , where N (cid:15) ( x ) is the (cid:15) - ball around point x . Refer to [ Roc15 ] for an introduction to convex analysis . In the proof , we also use the gradient theorem for line integrals , which is a common generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus . We recall it here without proof . Refer to Wikipedia entry [ Gra17 ] for discussion and proof : Claim 3 . 2 . 2 ( Gradient Theorem ) . Let ϕ : U ⊆ R n → R and γ is any curve from p to q . Then : ϕ ( q ) − ϕ ( p ) = (cid:90) γ [ p , q ] ∇ ϕ ( r ) · d r ( 3 . 2 . 18 ) 29 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 Proof of Lemma 3 . 2 . 4 . Let S be a proper retentive scoring rule . By Lemma 3 . 2 . 3 , there exist two functions G , H : P × P → R such that G ( P , Q ) is convex with respect to its ﬁrst argument , H ( P , Q ) is convex with respect to its second argument , and equation ( 3 . 2 . 10 ) is satisﬁed . When P , Q and R are categorical random variables with n + 1 possible outcomes , equation ( 3 . 2 . 10 ) is deﬁned over the n - dimensional simplex ∆ n . Let D = (cid:8) ( x 1 , . . . , x n ) ∈ R n + | (cid:80) i x i ≤ 1 (cid:9) . Each point P on the simplex can be represented by a vector P = ( p 0 , . . . , p n ) ∈ R n + 1 + such that (cid:80) ni = 0 p i = 1 . To simplify the constraints , we deﬁne a bijection f : ∆ n → D as follows : f ( P ) ≡ ( p 1 , . . . , p n ) ∈ R n ( 3 . 2 . 19 ) f − 1 ( x ) ≡ (cid:32) 1 − n (cid:88) i = 1 x i , x 1 , . . . , x n (cid:33) ∈ ∆ n ( 3 . 2 . 20 ) using this bijection , we represent each point on the simplex using a n - dimensional vector in the domain . Denote : P ≡ f − 1 ( x ) , Q ≡ f − 1 ( y ) , R ≡ f − 1 ( z ) , f ( P ) ≡ { f ( P ) | P ∈ P } . Using this correspondence , we also deﬁne g ( x , y ) ≡ G ( P , Q ) , h ( x , y ) ≡ H ( P , Q ) . The as - sumption that G , H are analytic implies that the gradients of each function coincide with their corresponding subgradients ( See Remark 3 . 2 . 2 ) . We will now write ( 3 . 2 . 10 ) using the new parametrization . Let x , y , z ∈ f ( P ) . For the left - hand side of ( 3 . 2 . 10 ) we obtain : ∂g ∂ x · ( z − x ) = n (cid:88) i = 1 ∂g ∂x i ( z i − x i ) ( 3 . 2 . 21 ) [ Calculate the derivative of g using the chain rule ] = n (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:18) ∂G ∂p i − ∂G ∂p 0 (cid:19) ( z i − x i ) ( 3 . 2 . 22 ) [ Rearrange the summations ] = ∂G ∂p 0 n (cid:88) i = 1 ( − z i + x i ) + n (cid:88) i = 1 ∂G ∂p i · ( z i − x i ) ( 3 . 2 . 23 ) = ∂G ∂p 0 (cid:32)(cid:32) 1 − n (cid:88) i = 1 z i (cid:33) − (cid:32) 1 − n (cid:88) i = 1 x i (cid:33)(cid:33) + n (cid:88) i = 1 ∂G ∂p i · ( z i − x i ) ( 3 . 2 . 24 ) [ Use the deﬁnition of x , z ] = n (cid:88) i = 0 ∂G ∂p i ( r i − p i ) ( 3 . 2 . 25 ) = ∇ G · ( R − P ) ( 3 . 2 . 26 ) A similar argument on the right - hand side of ( 3 . 2 . 10 ) shows that ∇ H · ( R − Q ) = h + ∂h∂ y · ( z − y ) , and therefore the system deﬁned in ( 3 . 2 . 10 ) is equivalent to : ∀ x , y , z ∈ f ( P ) : g + ∂g ∂ x · ( z − x ) = − (cid:18) h + ∂h ∂ y · ( z − y ) (cid:19) ( 3 . 2 . 27 ) We will now simplify ( 3 . 2 . 27 ) using its linear properties . Denote the aﬃne hull of f ( P ) by Aﬀ ( f ( p ) ) ≡ v 0 + V , and assume v 0 is a relative interior point . Taking z = v 0 in equation ( 3 . 2 . 27 ) yields : g + ∂g ∂ x · ( v 0 − x ) = − (cid:18) h + ∂h ∂ y · ( v 0 − y ) (cid:19) ( 3 . 2 . 28 ) 30 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 Similarly , denote the i th basis vector of V by ¯ v i . For any i ∈ [ dim V ] , taking z = v 0 + ¯ v i in equation ( 3 . 2 . 27 ) , with appropriate scaling of ¯ v i such that z ∈ f ( P ) , yields : ∀ i ∈ [ dim V ] : g + ∂g ∂ x · ( v 0 + ¯ v i − x ) = − (cid:18) h + ∂h ∂ y · ( v 0 + ¯ v i − y ) (cid:19) ( 3 . 2 . 29 ) Subtracting ( 3 . 2 . 28 ) from ( 3 . 2 . 29 ) we obtain : ∀ i ∈ [ dim V ] : ∂g ( x , y ) ∂ x · ¯ v i = − ∂h ( x , y ) ∂ y · ¯ v i ( 3 . 2 . 30 ) thus ∂g ( x , y ) ∂ x and − ∂h ( x , y ) ∂ y are equal component - wise , and therefore ∂g ( x , y ) ∂ x + ∂h ( x , y ) ∂ y is orthogonal to the aﬃne hull : ∀ v ∈ V : (cid:18) ∂g ( x , y ) ∂ x + ∂h ( x , y ) ∂ y (cid:19) · v = 0 ( 3 . 2 . 31 ) Note that ( z − x ) , ( z − y ) , ( y − x ) ∈ V . Substitute ( 3 . 2 . 31 ) back into ( 3 . 2 . 27 ) to obtain : g + ∂g ∂ x · ( y − x ) = − h ( 3 . 2 . 32 ) Apply ∂∂ y on both sides to get : ∂g ∂ y + ∂ ∂ y n (cid:88) i = 1 ∂g ∂x i ( y i − x i ) = − ∂h ∂ y ( 3 . 2 . 33 ) And using ( 3 . 2 . 31 ) again we obtain : ∂ ∂ y n (cid:88) i = 1 ∂g ∂x i ( y i − x i ) = 0 ( 3 . 2 . 34 ) Which is equivalent to : ∀ k ∈ [ n ] : ∂g ∂y k + n (cid:88) i = 1 ( y i − x i ) ∂ ∂x i ∂g ∂y k = 0 ( 3 . 2 . 35 ) This is a system of n independent ﬁrst - order partial diﬀerential equations for each element in ∂g∂ y . Using Claim 3 . 2 . 1 , we obtain the general solution for each k : ∀ k ∈ [ n ] , ∃ α k , 1 , . . . , α k , n : ∂g ∂y k = n (cid:88) i = 1 α k , i ( y ) ( y i − x i ) ( 3 . 2 . 36 ) Packing back the equations to vector form , we deﬁne a matrix operator A : D → R n × n such that A i , j [ y ] = α k , i ( y ) . The system in ( 3 . 2 . 36 ) in now be compactly represented using matrix multiplication : ∂g ∂ y = A [ y ] ( y − x ) ( 3 . 2 . 37 ) We now use the correspondence established in Theorem 3 . 2 . 1 to show that the generalized entropy functions G , H induce a separable scoring rule . Applying the gradient theorem ( 3 . 2 . 18 ) along the curve γ ( t ) = 0 + t y for t ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] yields : g ( x , y ) − g ( x , 0 ) = (cid:90) 1 0 (cid:32) y T (cid:32) ∂g ∂ y (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) x , t y (cid:33)(cid:33) d t ( 3 . 2 . 38 ) = (cid:90) 1 0 (cid:0) y T A [ t y ] ( t y − x ) (cid:1) d t ( 3 . 2 . 39 ) 31 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 Denote ψ ( x ) ≡ g ( x , 0 ) and ϕ ( x , y ) ≡ (cid:82) 10 (cid:0) y T A [ t y ] ( t y − x ) (cid:1) d t . Note that ϕ ( x , y ) is a linear function of x . The scoring rule which corresponds to g is given by Theorem 3 . 2 . 1 : S ( x , y , z ) = g ( x , y ) + ∂g ( x , y ) ∂ x · ( z − x ) ( 3 . 2 . 40 ) = ψ ( x ) + ∂ψ ( x ) ∂ x · ( z − x ) (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) ≡ s 1 + ϕ ( x , y ) + ∂ϕ ( x , y ) ∂ x · ( z − x ) (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) ≡ s 2 ( 3 . 2 . 41 ) The terms denoted by s 1 only depend on x and z , and therefore s 1 = s 1 ( x , z ) . In addition , ϕ ( x , y ) is a linear function of x and therefore both ∂ϕ ( x , y ) ∂ x and (cid:16) ϕ ( x , y ) − ∂ϕ ( x , y ) ∂ x · x (cid:17) do not depend on x , thus s 2 = s 2 ( y , z ) . The scoring rule S ( x , y , z ) can therefore be written in the following form : S ( x , y , z ) = s 1 ( x , z ) − s 2 ( y , z ) ( 3 . 2 . 42 ) and applying the reverse transformation from x , y , z ∈ D to P , Q , R ∈ P implies the separability of the original scoring rule S . Concluding the Proof We can now conclude the section by proving the characterization theorem for retentive scoring rules . For the ﬁnal proof , recall Deﬁnition 3 . 1 . 3 of symmetric retentive rules . Proof of Theorem 3 . 1 . 1 . Given a proper scoring rule s : P × X → R such that S ( P , Q , i ) = s ( P , i ) − s ( Q , i ) − 1 , we can apply Lemma 3 . 2 . 2 to show that S ( P , Q , i ) is retentive . Conversely , given an analytic retentive scoring rule , we can apply Lemma 3 . 2 . 4 and obtain s 1 , s 2 such that S ( P , Q , i ) = s 1 ( P , i ) − s 2 ( Q , i ) . The rule S is retentive , and therefore satisﬁes ( 3 . 1 . 5 ) . for all P ∈ P and Q = P we obtain : S ( P , P , i ) = s 1 ( P , i ) − s 2 ( P , i ) = − 1 ( 3 . 2 . 43 ) and therefore s 1 ( P , i ) = s 2 ( P , i ) − 1 for all P , proving that S is symmetric . 3 . 3 . Monotonicity In this section we show that expected retention score in each round grows with the size of memory span , proving Theorem 3 . 1 . 2 : Theorem 3 . 1 . 2 ( Knowledgeable Gurus Retain Better ) . Let S : P × P × X → R be an analytic retentive scoring rule , let G 1 , G 2 be two gurus with memory spans m ( 1 ) g ≥ m ( 2 ) g . Then for any distribution T , any coordinate x , and follower with memory span m f ≤ m ( 2 ) g : E T [ S ( P 1 , Q , x ) ] ≥ E T [ S ( P 2 , Q , x ) ] ( 3 . 1 . 11 ) where P 1 , P 2 ∈ ∆ ( X ) are the distributional forecasts of gurus G 1 and G 2 respectively , and Q ∈ ∆ ( X ) is the belief of the follower . The proof will require a deﬁnition and a lemma : We ﬁrst deﬁne the notion of Localized Expected Gain ( Deﬁnition 3 . 3 . 1 ) , which is a set function that quantiﬁes the expected score for diﬀerent choices of prior data . We then show that this function is monotone by proving Lemma 3 . 3 . 1 , and use the result to prove the theorem itself . 32 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 Preliminaries We denote the jointly distributed vector by ( X 1 , . . . , X n ) ∼ T . The marginal distribution of coordinate i is denoted by X i . For t ∈ [ n ] and I ⊆ [ n ] such as t / ∈ I , the marginal value of coordinate t conditioned on the event X (cid:23) I = x (cid:23) I is denoted by ( X t | x I ) . When probability calculations are involved , we will omit the harpoon notation for brevity , and x I and x (cid:23) I will be used interchangeably . Deﬁnition 3 . 3 . 1 ( Localized Expected Gain ) . Let ( X 1 , . . . , X t ) ∼ D ∈ ∆ (cid:0) X t (cid:1) be a set of t jointly - distributed random variables , let I ⊆ [ t − 1 ] , and let s : ∆ ( X ) × X → R be a proper ( one - party ) scoring rule . The localized expected gain is a set function f : 2 [ t − 1 ] → R deﬁned as follows : ∀ I ⊆ [ t − 1 ] : f ( I ) ≡ E ( x 1 , . . . , x t ) ∼ D [ s ( ( X t | x I ) , x t ) ] ( 3 . 3 . 1 ) Intuitively , the localized expected gain function f ( I ) describes the expected score when X (cid:23) I is being used as a prior . For example , for the log scoring rule s ( P , i ) = log p i deﬁned in ( 3 . 1 . 3 ) , the associated expected localized gain function is : f log ( I ) = (cid:88) x I Pr ( x I ) (cid:88) x t Pr ( x t | x I ) log Pr ( x t | x I ) = − H ( X t | X I ) ( 3 . 3 . 2 ) which is the additive inverse of the conditional entropy of X t given X I . We now show that this function is also monotone for general proper scoring rules , which means that expected scores don’t decrease when adding prior information , or “more knowledge doesn’t hurt“ regardless of the proper scoring rule being used : Lemma 3 . 3 . 1 . f is a monotone set function : ∀ I ⊆ J ⊆ [ t − 1 ] : f ( I ) ≤ f ( J ) ( 3 . 3 . 3 ) Proof . We start with the deﬁnition of f ( I ) : f ( I ) = E ( x 1 , . . . , x t ) ∼ D [ s ( ( X t | x I ) , x t ) ] ( 3 . 3 . 4 ) = (cid:88) x [ t − 1 ] , x t Pr (cid:0) x [ t − 1 ] , x t (cid:1) s ( ( X t | x I ) , x t ) ( 3 . 3 . 5 ) [ Decompose Pr (cid:0) x [ t − 1 ] , x t (cid:1) using the law of total probability ] = (cid:88) x [ t − 1 ] , x t Pr ( x J ) Pr ( x t | x J ) Pr (cid:0) x [ t − 1 ] \ J | x t , x J (cid:1) s ( ( X t | x I ) , x t ) ( 3 . 3 . 6 ) [ s does not depend on y [ t ] \ J . Rearrange the summation ] = (cid:88) x J Pr ( x J ) (cid:88) x t Pr ( x t | x J ) s ( ( X t | x I ) , x t ) (cid:88) x [ t − 1 ] \ J Pr (cid:0) x [ t − 1 ] \ J | x t , x J (cid:1) ( 3 . 3 . 7 ) [ The rightmost factor is equal to 1 ] = (cid:88) x J Pr ( x J ) (cid:88) x t Pr ( x t | x J ) s ( ( X t | x I ) , x t ) ( 3 . 3 . 8 ) Using the deﬁnition of expected one - party score deﬁned in ( 3 . 2 . 3 ) , we obtain that the rightmost factor in ( 3 . 3 . 8 ) is the expected score of P = ( X t | x I ) when the reference distribution is R = ( X t | x J ) : f ( I ) = (cid:88) x J Pr ( x J ) s ( ( X t | x I ) , ( X t | x J ) ) ( 3 . 3 . 9 ) 33 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 We can now use the properness of s ( see Deﬁnition 3 . 1 . 1 ) to obtain : f ( I ) ≤ (cid:88) x J Pr ( x J ) s ( ( X t | x J ) , ( X t | x J ) ) ( 3 . 3 . 10 ) and apply steps ( 3 . 3 . 4 ) , . . . , ( 3 . 3 . 8 ) in reverse order to obtain (cid:88) x J Pr ( x J ) s ( ( X t | x J ) , ( X t | x J ) ) = f ( J ) ( 3 . 3 . 11 ) proving that f ( I ) ≤ f ( J ) . Using Lemma 3 . 3 . 1 we can generalize the result to retentive scoring rules , and prove the monotonicity theorem for retentive scoring rules : Proof of Theorem 3 . 1 . 2 . Guru 1 has memory span m 1 g , and therefore P 1 = ( T | u (cid:23) I 1 ) such that | I 1 | = m 1 g . Similarly , for guru 2 we obtain P 2 = ( T | u (cid:23) I 2 ) such that | I 2 | = m 2 g and for the follower Q = ( T | u (cid:23) J ) such that | J | = m f . S is analytic , and therefore symmetric according to Theorem 3 . 1 . 1 . Denote S ( P , Q , i ) = s ( P , i ) − s ( Q , i ) − 1 . Taking the expectation over T we obtain : E T [ S ( P , Q , i ) ] = E T [ s ( P , i ) ] − E T [ s ( Q , i ) ] − 1 ( 3 . 3 . 12 ) Using Deﬁnition 3 . 3 . 1 we obtain : E T [ S ( P , Q , i ) ] = f ( I ) − f ( J ) − 1 ( 3 . 3 . 13 ) When m 1 g ≥ m 2 g and under the optimal choice of I 1 , there exists I (cid:48) 1 such that I 2 ⊆ I (cid:48) 1 and f ( I (cid:48) 1 ) ≤ f ( I 1 ) . Applying Lemma 3 . 3 . 1 we obtain : E T [ S ( P 1 , Q , i ) ] = f ( I 1 ) − f ( J ) − 1 ( 3 . 3 . 14 ) ≥ f (cid:0) I (cid:48) 1 (cid:1) − f ( J ) − 1 ( 3 . 3 . 15 ) ≥ f ( I 2 ) − f ( J ) − 1 ( 3 . 3 . 16 ) = E T [ S ( P 2 , Q , i ) ] ( 3 . 3 . 17 ) and therefore E T [ S ( P 1 , Q , i ) ] ≥ E T [ S ( P 2 , Q , i ) ] . 3 . 4 . The Binary Attributes Model Under the Binary Attributes model , the universe of users is modeled using a k - dimensional linear subspace of F n 2 . U = span { ¯ u 1 , . . . , ¯ u k } ( 3 . 4 . 1 ) where ¯ u 1 , . . . , ¯ u k ∈ F n 2 are a choice of basis vectors for the subspace . Under this realization of the Collaborative Discovery model , each user is represented using an n - dimensional binary vector , formally X n = F n 2 . Preliminaries This section will assume familiarity with basic linear algebra over ﬁnite ﬁelds . A view I ⊆ [ n ] of a vector u ∈ F n 2 , denoted by u (cid:23) I , is a linear projection of u to the subspace V I = span { e i | i ∈ I } . Similar to the previous section , we omit the harpoon notation when complex conditional probability expressions are involved . Given a vector space U , its dual space is deﬁned as the set of linear constraints : U ⊥ ≡ { v ∈ F n 2 | ∀ u ∈ U : (cid:104) u , v (cid:105) = 0 } . The support of a vector u ∈ U is the of coordinates that contain non - zero elements : support ( u ) = { i | u i (cid:54) = 0 } . We denote the hamming distance of a vector u ∈ U by d ( u ) = | support ( u ) | . The hamming distance of the space U is deﬁned as d ( U ) = min u ∈ U \ { 0 } d ( u ) . 34 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 3 . 4 . 1 . User Types as a Linear Subspace We follow with a rigorous deﬁnition of the process under the Binary Attributes realization : Initialization At the start of the Collaborative Discovery process , the type of user u is picked uniformly from U , all the coordinates are undisclosed , and the initial retention parameter is r 0 . We will denote the uniform random variable over the linear space by U ∼ Uniform ( U ) . Prediction Rounds During each round , the expert picks a coordinate i and provides a predic - tion distribution P ∈ ∆ ( { 0 , 1 } ) for its value . The retentive scoring function for this realization of the model is : S bin ( P , Q , x ) = 2 log 2 p x − 2 log 2 q x − 1 ( 3 . 4 . 2 ) where x ∈ { 0 , 1 } . S bin can be represented as S bin ( P , Q , x ) = s ( Q , x ) − s ( Q , x ) − 1 , where s ( P , x ) = 2 log 2 p x is the logarithmic scoring rule deﬁned in ( 3 . 1 . 3 ) , and therefore S bin is sym - metric according to Deﬁnition 3 . 1 . 3 . We’ll proceed to show that S bin has very intuitive properties . We start with a few claims about the structure of this probability space . The claims can be proved using basic linear algebra and probability . Proofs are included in Section A . 2 : Claim 3 . 4 . 1 . Let I ⊆ [ n ] . For every vector u I ∈ U I : Pr ( U I = u I ) = 2 − dim ( U I ) ( 3 . 4 . 3 ) For the following claim , recall that a singleton distribution is a probability distribution in which a single outcome has probability 1 . Claim 3 . 4 . 2 . Let I ⊆ [ n ] and m ∈ [ n ] \ I , and assume a vector u ∈ F n 2 has been picked uniformly at random from a vector space U . Pr ( u m | u I ) is a singleton distribution if and only if e m ∈ U ⊥ (cid:23) [ n ] \ I . Claim 3 . 4 . 3 . Let U be a linear space over F 2 n , and let I ⊆ [ n ] , m ∈ [ n ] \ I . e m ∈ U ⊥ (cid:23) [ n ] \ I if and only if dim ( U (cid:23) I ) = dim (cid:0) U (cid:23) I ∪ { m } (cid:1) . Using this framework , we now have enough tools to characterize the dynamics of scoring rule we deﬁned : Lemma 3 . 4 . 1 ( Binary Attributes Scoring Rule Dynamics ) . For a uniform distribution U over a linear space U without constant bits , the retention score for a collaborative discovery process with inﬁnite expert locality and zero layperson locality is given by : S bin ( ( X m | x I ) , X m , U ) = (cid:40) 1 e m ∈ U ⊥ (cid:23) [ n ] \ I − 1 otherwise ( 3 . 4 . 4 ) = (cid:40) 1 dim (cid:0) U (cid:23) I ∪ { m } (cid:1) = dim ( U (cid:23) I ) − 1 dim (cid:0) U (cid:23) I ∪ { m } (cid:1) = dim ( U (cid:23) I ) + 1 ( 3 . 4 . 5 ) Proof . When e m / ∈ U ⊥ (cid:23) [ n ] \ I , we get that dim (cid:0) U (cid:23) { m } (cid:1) = 1 , allowing us to apply Claim 3 . 4 . 1 and obtain Pr ( u m = 0 | u I ) = 12 . When e m ∈ U ⊥ (cid:23) [ n ] \ I there exists v ∈ U ⊥ , I (cid:48) ⊆ I such that support ( v ) = I (cid:48) ∪ { m } . Claim 3 . 4 . 2 implies that u m is determined given u I . 35 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 Combining the results , we obtain for all I ⊆ [ n ] , m / ∈ I : Pr ( u m = 0 | u I ) ∈ (cid:40) { 0 , 1 } e m ∈ U ⊥ (cid:23) [ n ] \ I (cid:8) 12 (cid:9) otherwise ( 3 . 4 . 6 ) There are no constant bits in U , and therefore dim U (cid:23) { m } = 1 for all m ∈ [ n ] . By Claim 3 . 4 . 1 we obtain that the marginal distribution for each coordinate is uniform , and therefore a layper - son with zero locality will always predict a uniform distribution . Plugging ( 3 . 4 . 6 ) into the deﬁnition of S bin in equation ( 3 . 4 . 2 ) , the score for the ﬁrst case is log 2 1 2 · 0 . 5 2 = 1 , and the score for the second case is log 2 0 . 5 2 2 · 0 . 5 2 = − 1 , leading to equation ( 3 . 4 . 4 ) . The transition from ( 3 . 4 . 4 ) to ( 3 . 4 . 5 ) is given by Claim 3 . 4 . 3 . 3 . 4 . 2 . Retention Complexity of Linear Codes We will now apply the notion of retention complexity introduced in Deﬁnition 3 . 1 . 6 to the Binary Attributes model . We will ﬁrst show that there exist non - trivial upper and lower bounds for retention complexity in this realization of the Collaborative Discovery model , and then show that the bounds are tight . Recall Lemma 3 . 1 . 1 : Lemma 3 . 1 . 1 ( Retention Complexity Bounds for Linear Spaces ) . For a uniform distribution U over a linear space U ⊆ F 2 n with unbounded guru memory span and zero follower memory span , the retention complexity satisﬁes : d (cid:16) U ⊥ (cid:17) − 1 ≤ r ( S bin , ∞ , 0 ) ( U ) ≤ dim ( U ) ( 3 . 1 . 14 ) Proof of Lemma 3 . 1 . 1 . The retention parameter at the end of each round t is deﬁned according to equation ( 3 . 1 . 1 ) : r t = r 0 + t (cid:88) i = 1 S bin ( ( X σ i | x I i ) , X σ i , U ) ( 3 . 4 . 7 ) For the lower bound , observe that U ⊥ (cid:23) [ n ] \ I t does not contain any singleton element when | I t | ≤ d (cid:0) U ⊥ (cid:1) − 2 . Since | I t | ≤ t − 1 by deﬁnition , we can combine the inequalities and obtain that no punctured - dual - space singleton exists when t ≤ d (cid:0) U ⊥ (cid:1) − 1 . We can now apply Lemma 3 . 4 . 1 and obtain that S bin ( ( X σ i | x I i ) , X σ i , U ) = − 1 for all i ∈ { 1 , . . . , t } . Plugging into the retention parameter at time t = d (cid:0) U ⊥ (cid:1) − 1 : r t = r 0 + d ( U ⊥ ) − 1 (cid:88) i = 1 ( − 1 ) = r 0 − (cid:16) d (cid:16) U ⊥ (cid:17) − 1 (cid:17) ( 3 . 4 . 8 ) And the positivity constraint on r t implies that r 0 ≥ (cid:0) d (cid:0) U ⊥ (cid:1) − 1 (cid:1) . For the upper bound , assume without loss of generality that the ﬁrst k = dim ( U ) coordinates of U are linearly independent , and set σ i = i , I i = { 1 , . . . , ( i − 1 ) } for all i ∈ { 1 , . . . , k } . Observe that : dim ( U (cid:23) I i ) = (cid:40) i − 1 1 ≤ i ≤ k k k < i ( 3 . 4 . 9 ) Applying Lemma 3 . 4 . 1 we get : S bin ( ( X σ i | x I i ) , X σ i , U ) = (cid:40) − 1 1 ≤ i ≤ k 1 k < i ( 3 . 4 . 10 ) Hence for r 0 = k we get r t ≥ 0 for all t ∈ { 1 , . . . , n } . 36 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 In the asymptotic setting it is common to consider n , k → ∞ . In this case , d (cid:0) U ⊥ (cid:1) can stay constant , forming a large gap between the bounds . We will proceed to show that the upper and lower bounds are indeed tight in the asymptotic setting . Walsh - Hadamard Codes are Easy to Retain Let n = 2 k − 1 . Given a binary message x ∈ { 0 , 1 } k , the Walsh - Hadamard code ( WH ) encodes the message into a codeword WH ( x ) using an encoding function WH : { 0 , 1 } k → { 0 , 1 } n , such that for every y ∈ (cid:16) { 0 , 1 } k \ (cid:8) 0 k (cid:9)(cid:17) , the y th coordinate of WH ( x ) is equal to ( x · y ) . Walsh - Hadamard a (cid:2) 2 k − 1 , k , 2 k − 1 (cid:3) 2 locally - correctable code with q = 2 queries 1 . See [ AB09 ] for a thorough discussion of Walsh - Hadamard codes and its applications in theoretical computer science . We will show that a uniform distribution over the WH code achieves the retention complexity lower bound for all k ∈ N . Recall Lemma 3 . 1 . 2 : Lemma 3 . 1 . 2 ( Walsh - Hadamard Retention Complexity ) . For all k ∈ N , a k - dimensional Walsh - Hadamard code satisﬁes : r ( S bin , ∞ , 0 ) ( WH ) = 2 ( 3 . 1 . 15 ) In order to prove the lemma , we ﬁrst characterize the constraints of the WH code ( Claim 3 . 4 . 4 , Claim 3 . 4 . 5 ) , and then use the results to construct an explicit formula for the retention score when the S bin retentive score rule is being used ( Lemma 3 . 4 . 2 ) , giving an upper bound for r ( S bin , ∞ , 0 ) ( WH ) which is equal to the lower bound we established in Lemma 3 . 1 . 1 . Proofs for the claims can be found in Section A . 2 . Claim 3 . 4 . 4 . Let y ( 1 ) , . . . , y ( m ) ∈ (cid:16) { 0 , 1 } k \ (cid:8) 0 k (cid:9)(cid:17) . (cid:32) m (cid:88) i = 1 e y ( i ) (cid:33) ∈ WH ⊥ ⇐⇒ m (cid:88) i = 1 y ( i ) = 0 ( 3 . 4 . 11 ) Claim 3 . 4 . 5 . d (cid:16) WH ⊥ (cid:17) = 3 ( 3 . 4 . 12 ) Lemma 3 . 4 . 2 . For collaborative discovery over u ∈ R WH with respect to ( S bin , ∞ , 0 ) , where σ i = (cid:0) i mod 2 k (cid:1) and r 0 = 2 , and for all t ∈ (cid:8) 1 , . . . , 2 k − 1 (cid:9) : ∀ 1 ≤ t < 2 k : r t = t − 2 (cid:98) log 2 t (cid:99) ( 3 . 4 . 13 ) Proof . By induction . For t ∈ { 1 , 2 } , we can use Claim 3 . 4 . 5 and an argument similar to the one in Lemma 3 . 1 . 1 to show that there’s no singleton in the punctured dual - space in the ﬁrst two rounds . Therefore r 1 = 1 , r 2 = 0 , and indeed we can substitute 0 , 1 into ( 3 . 4 . 13 ) see that 1 − 2 (cid:98) log 2 1 (cid:99) = 1 and 1 − 2 (cid:98) log 2 2 (cid:99) = 1 . For t > 2 , assume the formula holds for t − 1 , and consider the two following cases : • When t is not a power of two , it can be represented as the XOR between two preceding coordinates , for example t (cid:48) = 2 (cid:98) log 2 t (cid:99) and t (cid:48)(cid:48) = t − 2 (cid:98) log 2 t (cid:99) . Using Claim 3 . 4 . 4 we obtain that e t is a singleton in the punctured dual - space , and therefore r t = r t − 1 + 1 by Lemma 3 . 4 . 1 . 1 Note that we slightly deviate from the common deﬁnition by omitting the 0th coordinate which is always equal to zero . 37 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 Using the induction hypothesis and the fact that (cid:98) log 2 t (cid:99) = (cid:98) log 2 ( t − 1 ) (cid:99) when t is not a power of two , we obtain : r t = r t − 1 + 1 = ( t − 1 ) − 2 (cid:98) log 2 ( t − 1 ) (cid:99) + 1 = t − 2 (cid:98) log 2 t (cid:99) • When t is a power of two , it cannot be represented as the XOR between preceding co - ordinates , as for all of them the index of the most signiﬁcant bit is strictly less than log 2 t . By Lemma 3 . 4 . 1 we obtain that r t = r t − 1 − 1 , and using the fact that (cid:98) log 2 t (cid:99) = (cid:98) log 2 ( t − 1 ) (cid:99) + 1 when t is a power of two we indeed get : r t = r t − 1 − 1 = ( t − 1 ) − 2 (cid:98) log 2 ( t − 1 ) (cid:99) − 1 = t − 2 (cid:98) log 2 t (cid:99) Remark 3 . 4 . 1 . Using a slight variation of this proof it is possible to construct an upper bound for the stricter case of r ( S bin , 2 , 0 ) ( WH ) ( using a proper choice of reference groups I t ⊆ [ n ] ) , but for now we are interested with the simpler case of m g → ∞ . We can now conclude and prove Lemma 3 . 1 . 2 : Proof of Lemma 3 . 1 . 2 . Lemma 3 . 4 . 2 shows an upper bound of 2 for the retention complexity of WH . Lemma 3 . 1 . 1 tells us that this is also the lower bound for the retention complexity in this case , and therefore r ( S bin , ∞ , 0 ) ( WH ) = 2 . Random LDPC Codes are Asymptotically Hard to Retain Let G = ( L , R , E ) be a bipartite multigraph with | L | = n , | R | = m . Associate a distinct Boolean variable x i with any i ∈ L . For each j ∈ R , let N ( j ) ⊆ L be the set of neighbors of j . The j th constraint is A j ( x 1 , . . . , x n ) = (cid:80) i ∈ N ( j ) x i mod 2 . The code deﬁned by G is : C ( G ) = { x ∈ { 0 , 1 } n | ∀ j ∈ [ m ] : A j ( x ) = 0 } A random ( c , d ) - regular LDPC code of length n is obtained by taking C ( G ) for a random ( c , d ) - regular G with n left vertices . Random LDPC codes were ﬁrst described and analyzed by [ Gal62 ] . We will show that a randomly chosen LDPC code asymptotically achieves the upper bound for retention complexity with high probability . Recall Theorem 3 . 1 . 3 : Theorem 3 . 1 . 3 ( LDPC Retention Complexity ) . For a proper choice of constants c , d > 0 and suﬃciently large n , the retention complexity of a random ( c , d ) - regular LDPC code over F n 2 is linear with high probability : r ( S bin , ∞ , 0 ) ( LDPC ) = w . h . p Ω ( dim ( LDPC ) ) ( 3 . 1 . 16 ) Deﬁnition 3 . 4 . 1 ( ( q , µ ) code locality , [ BHR05 ] ) . A linear space V is ( q , µ ) - local if every v ∈ V that is a sum of at least µm basis vectors has d ( v ) ≥ q . 38 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 The following lemma shows that a random LDPC code has ( q , µ ) - locality with high probability for a proper choice of parameters : Lemma 3 . 4 . 3 ( [ BHR05 ] , Lemma 3 . 6 ) . Fix odd integer c ≥ 7 and constants µ , δ , d > 0 satisfying : µ ≤ c − 2 100 ; δ < µ c ; d > 2 µc 2 ( µ c − δ ) 2 ( 3 . 4 . 14 ) Then , for all suﬃciently large n , with high probability for a random ( c , d ) - regular graph G with n left vertices and m = cd n right vertices , the corresponding LDPC code C ( G ) is linearly - independent , and ( δn , µ ) - local . Remark 3 . 4 . 2 ( A Proper Choice of Parameters ) . For our proof of Theorem 3 . 1 . 3 , the constants in ( 3 . 4 . 14 ) need be chosen such that δ − 2 µcd ≥ 0 . Such a choice of random code parameters is indeed possible : For example , by ﬁxing c ≥ 7 and taking µ = c − 2 100 , δ = ( µ c − ε 0 ) , d = 8 µc 2 ( µ c − δ ) 2 we get : δ − 2 µc d = µ c − ε 0 − 2 µc 8 µc 2 ( µ c − δ ) 2 = µ c − ε 0 − ε 20 4 c Which is strictly larger than zero for all 0 < ε 0 < 2 c (cid:18)(cid:113) 1 + µ c c − 1 (cid:19) . We now use this to prove Theorem 3 . 1 . 3 : Proof of Theorem 3 . 1 . 3 . Fix odd integer c ≥ 7 and constants µ , ε , δ , d > 0 satisfying equation ( 3 . 4 . 14 ) and δ ≥ µcd . See Remark 3 . 4 . 2 for a speciﬁc choice of such constants . Let V be a random LDPC code of dimension n corresponding to this choice of constants . Assume that n is large enough to satisfy Lemma 3 . 4 . 3 . Assume by contradiction that r 0 ≤ n (cid:16) δ − 2 µcd (cid:17) − 1 , and the Collaborative Discovery process lasts until round n . Set t = (cid:98) δn (cid:99) − 1 . At the end of round t , the coordinates I t ⊆ [ n ] are disclosed . Denote by n − the number of times a uniform distribution was predicted by the expert . Using Lemma 3 . 4 . 1 , the total retention accumulated at the end of round t is equal to : r t = r 0 − n − + ( t − n − ) ( 3 . 4 . 15 ) r t ≥ 0 , and therefore n − ≤ t + r 0 2 . Using Lemma 3 . 4 . 1 again , we obtain that n − = dim ( V (cid:23) I t ) . In addition , the dimensions of a vector space and its dual sum up to t , hence dim (cid:16) ( V (cid:23) I t ) ⊥ (cid:17) = ( t − n − ) ≥ t − r 0 2 . This gives us a lower bound for dim (cid:16) ( V (cid:23) I t ) ⊥ (cid:17) . ( V (cid:23) I t ) ⊥ consists of vectors v ∈ V ⊥ such that support ( v ) ⊆ I t . The conditions of Lemma 3 . 4 . 3 are satisﬁed by our choice of constants , and we can apply it to obtain that V ⊥ of the random code we picked is ( δn , µ ) - local with high probability , and therefore every v ∈ V ⊥ that is a sum of at least cd µn dual basis vectors has d ( v ) ≥ δn . For t < δn , all the vectors of ( V (cid:23) I t ) ⊥ are a sum of cd µn basis vectors at most , hence dim (cid:0) V ⊥ I (cid:1) ≤ cd µn , implying an upper bound for dim (cid:16) ( V (cid:23) I t ) ⊥ (cid:17) . Combining the bounds we obtain : t − r 0 2 ≤ dim (cid:16) ( V (cid:23) I t ) ⊥ (cid:17) < c dµn ( 3 . 4 . 16 ) 39 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 For t = (cid:98) δn (cid:99) − 1 and r 0 ≤ n (cid:16) δ − 2 µcd (cid:17) − 1 we have : t − r 0 2 ≥ ( δn − 1 ) − (cid:16) n (cid:16) δ − 2 µcd (cid:17) − 1 (cid:17) 2 = c dµn ( 3 . 4 . 17 ) Leading to a contradiction , since the lower bound in equation ( 3 . 4 . 16 ) must be greater than the upper bound . From this we get r 0 > n (cid:16) δ − 2 µcd (cid:17) , and therefore r 0 = Ω ( n ) = Ω ( dim ( V ) ) . 40 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 4 . Discussion of Main Results and Conclusions 4 . 1 . Baby CROINC Baby CROINC is a crowd - based platform for child development tracking and screening , which integrates expert - curated crowd data using a CCI process to achieve its two main design goals , personalization and objectivity . Baby CROINC facilitated the creation of personalized devel - opmental diaries , as demonstrated by the rich array of milestone choices and developmental domains focuses seen in diﬀerent users’ diaries . Parents’ activity patterns show the value of allowing free selection and narration of a personal developmental proﬁle that matches the stage , context and interests of each child and family . Parents tended to describe milestones in the context of speciﬁc activities , objects , or family ( e . g . , “Jim started playing with shape sorter” ) . From a health care perspective , this developmental documentation can highlight areas of particular concern for a given family and milestones of which parents may be unaware . At the same time , personalization makes it diﬃcult to mean - ingfully compare diaries containing such diﬀerent behaviors , ages , time frames , and language choices . Baby CROINC relies on the power of crowd wisdom in overcoming these challenges , as well as the CCI approach for identifying common milestones across diaries despite variations in parent language . The most common milestones were in the gross - and ﬁne - motor domains . This is probably because these domains are easily observable and constantly changing during the ﬁrst year of life . Tracking motor milestones is important , as they are often the ﬁrst warning signs observed at an early age even if the disorder is not neuro - muscular ( e . g . , [ OYS + 09 ] ) . However , it is important to increase parental awareness of milestones attained and expected in social - communication domains as well . This awareness is critical for identifying delays and helping parents meet and enrich their child’s social - communication development . It is possible to facilitate the cre - ation of developmentally diverse diaries by tweaking the pool of suggested milestones presented to parents ; however , this may compromise the crowd - based approach Baby CROINC takes . The development of a design balancing both considerations is needed . These ﬁndings call for providing parents with more information regarding early childhood development , to promote awareness of age - appropriate development in the social - communication domain . Of course , Baby CROINC is meant to support and augment , not replace , real - world health care professional evaluations when they are available . In the absence of such evaluations , whether because of time gaps between doctor check - ups or because of insuﬃcient resources in developing or lower socio - economic communities , inaccurate information risks leading to un - necessary parental anxiety , and possibly resulting in false positive diagnoses of developmental delays—or worse , false negatives ( where the child needs intervention but is not properly di - agnosed ) . Considering these risks , research validating crowd - based percentiles is important to promote conﬁdence in their accuracy . The ﬁndings presented in this paper start this process by demonstrating “real - world” patterns . The data in the Internal Validity for Baby CROINC Per - centiles section show girls were in higher communication percentiles than boys , ﬁndings which are in line with traditional child development data [ BSC12 ] . Similarly , our ﬁndings about the lower developmental percentiles of preterm versus full - term children are in line with existing 41 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 evidence [ HORT02 ] . In the External Validity for Baby CROINC Percentiles section , the Baby CROINC percentiles were also validated against the published CDC age norms for comparable milestones . While most Baby CROINC percentiles tend to present a more advanced devel - opmental picture than the CDC , this is expected because the former records “ﬁrst achieved” while the latter lists “when to worry” which is generally later . This diﬀerence was greatest for milestones in the emotional , speech , and cognitive domains . We oﬀer two plausible hypotheses : ( 1 ) milestones in these domains have a higher threshold for clinical concern and a wider range of what is considered typical ; or ( 2 ) parents may be less equipped to precisely characterize these abstract domains . Similar diﬀerences were demonstrated in previous research , where mo - tor milestones were recorded earlier by mothers via electronic diary methods than they were observed clinically [ EDSF + 12 ] . This pattern of diﬀerences between modes of assessment can be attributed to standardized assessment’s goal of minimizing “false positives . ” One of the potential threats to the objectivity of such a platform is its sample bias . However , our user base shows encouraging indications of sample representation , as seen in the equal distribution of boys and girls and the reported rate of preterm births amongst Baby CROINC children ( 8 . 16 % ) , which corresponds to the population rate [ FCO + 16 ] . The correlations between Baby CROINC percentiles and CDC - published norms in corresponding developmental domains indicate that the sample is not biased in terms of a greater percentage of children with a developmental delay . Further work is needed to look at sample representation across other demographic features in a diverse population . Finally , results from this study indicate that CCI is a feasible and critical approach , given the personalized nature of the crowd data entered . Expert curators were highly involved in merging new milestones with existing ones and in classifying milestones into developmental domains . Figure 2 . 12 shows a continuous increase in new information entered by users over time , information that required curation . The experts’ work on merging and clarifying milestones directly aﬀected the crowd’s adoption of existing milestones and signiﬁcantly increased the users’ chances of viewing statistics for their children’s milestones . Our study is consistent with previous research showing that expert facilitators using a dashboard to manage real - time crowd data increased the quality of the information entered [ CDD16 , MJAL17 ] , and in our case also the information provided . As with any manual process , there is a cost to the use of human experts in terms of scalabil - ity and on - going resources . Enhancing the eﬃciency of the experts’ decision making is needed through the integration of automatic algorithms and assistance using natural language process - ing ( NLP ) and machine learning tools , and potentially with a crowd of experts . The manual work done so far by curators provides a natural source of high - quality training and evaluation examples to aid the development of such algorithms . For Baby CROINC’s purposes , the cu - ration must be of extremely high quality to maintain user trust . As automatic algorithms are likely to fall short of human quality , the tools will initially assist the curator behind the scenes in providing time - saving top suggestions to curators , which will then be conﬁrmed or overridden . Only when , or if , the tools are assessed as reliable enough to approach perfect performance ( as compared to the human gold standard ) will we consider replacing some or all of the expert curators’ tasks with automatic algorithms . In the meantime , however , as a helpful guide for humans , we expect them to increase the eﬃciency and scalability of the curators’ work . 4 . 1 . 1 . Limitations While we believe that the user - driven approach is beneﬁcial and needed in today’s online envi - ronment , it doesn’t allow control of the number and type of milestones entered by parents , thus posing new challenges when seeking to compare diﬀerent developmental trajectories for children 42 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 in our system . In addition , showing statistics to parents and particularly the skewness of the entries to early achievement may create a bias in data entry ; parents may wish to modify their reported milestone dates to improve their child’s statistics and present them as “early achievers , ” or reluctant to record milestones for which their children are more delayed . Adding information about standardized norms for each milestone can assist parents in interpreting skewed statistics . Characterizing parents who use the system—in terms of their technological proﬁciency , personal impact , and their user experience—may improve its applicability to diverse socio - economical backgrounds . For research in child development , studies looking at Baby CROINC percentiles’ correlation with traditional developmental test scores would be highly informative and would improve our understanding of the value of our system as a pre - screening tool . In absence of a clinical sample of children with known developmental disorders , the validity of Baby CROINC as a pre - screening tool has yet to be demonstrated . Finally , the amount of expert curation currently grows linearly with system size , making it too costly for massive - scale systems . However , the eﬀectiveness of automatic and curator - assisting algorithms utilizing NLP and machine learning tends to increase as the amount of data grows , and therefore we believe that an algorithm - assisted CCI approach will remain feasible even as the system continues to grow in size . 4 . 1 . 2 . Potential design improvements This study raises several ideas for further improvements to Baby CROINC : 1 . Integrating NLP and machine learning tools to improve the scalability of the crowd - curating process ( either as an aid to the expert and / or to automate aspects of the cura - tion ) ; 2 . Prompting parents to add milestones in developmental domains that they have not thought to focus on yet ; 3 . Presenting age - corrected statistics for children born preterm ; 4 . Increasing the amount of demographical / background information collected from parents , to improve the personalization of statistics and for child development research ; 5 . Providing ways to share the developmental conclusions in Baby CROINC with the chil - dren’s health care providers . 4 . 1 . 3 . Conclusions Baby CROINC is a crowd - based platform for child development tracking and screening , which integrates expert - curated crowd data . Its two main design goals are personalization and objec - tivity , using CCI to resolve the tension between them . Unlike pre - deﬁned developmental screening tools based on a ﬁxed number and type of mile - stones , Baby CROINC provides parents with an opportunity to describe development from their perspective , in their own words , and focus on their own interests and concerns . Yet unlike completely free - form narratives , like those on online parenting forums or social media , Baby CROINC provides objective statistical data to educate parents about their child’s development . Our work demonstrates the value of expert involvement in curating crowd - based child de - velopment data to provide high - quality , personalized statistics to parents . Further research is important for measuring the impact of using the system on advancing parental knowledge , parenting practices , and for early detection of developmental delays . 43 Technion - Computer Science Department - M .

Main contributions The properties of retentive scoring rules , the eﬀect of memory span discrepancy on the retention of followers , and the study of retention complexity of speciﬁc distributions are the main topics of this work . The main contributions reported in this work are : 1 . Introducing a mathematical model which explains why a “smarter” guru is expected to retain a larger following , in a way which is compatible with the individual incentives of the diﬀerent agents . 2 . Characterizing the functions that can act as retentive scoring rules , and showing that they can each be written in a surprisingly simple form , as symmetric ( and separable ) rules . 3 . For memory span , we prove the monotonicity theorem ( “more knowledge is better” ) , which shows that experts with larger memory span retain followers longer in expectation . 4 . We initiate the study of retention complexity , focusing on uniform distributions over linear spaces in F n 2 , exhibiting non - trivial lower bounds for random LDPC codes . 4 . 2 . 2 . Future directions We point out a few questions that emerge from the work : 1 . The gurus and followers studied here are assumed to have optimal knowledge of the distribution , up to their memory span limit . In particular , a guru with inﬁnite memory span does not need to learn the distribution at all . However , in most realistic settings the distribution is unknown , leading to the question of learning distributions in a way that also maintains good retention properties . For instance , suppose the distribution is an unknown linear space U with retention complexity r . What is the minimal number of followers with initial retention parameter r 0 > r ( say , r 0 = 2 · r ) that will be “spent” or “lost” by the guru before she learns enough about U to fully retain new followers ? This particular question is highly relevant to automated gurus that seek to attract users while maintaining high reputation ( e . g . , high app - store ratings ) . 2 . The gurus and followers used here are computationally unbounded ( or , more precisely , bounded only by attention span ) . Realistically , the computational complexity of com - puting marginals and evaluating which new attribute γ t to interact about will be highly non - trivial . 3 . Walsh - Hadamard codes are locally testable , correctable and decodable , while random LDPC codes have none of these properties ; moreover , the retention complexity for both families of codes is approximately equal to their query complexity ( for testability and cor - rectability ) . This leads to an interesting question : Are there tighter connections between retention complexity and query complexity of locally testable / correctable codes ? Do all q - query locally testable ( or correctable ) codes have retention complexity f ( q ) for some function that depends only on q and is independent of n ( input size ) ? Likewise , it seems interesting to ask whether retention complexity is related to basic machine learning mea - sures like VC dimension . 44 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc .

From ( A . 1 . 7 ) we obtain : ∀ j 1 , . . . , j n ∈ N : c j 1 , . . . , j n (cid:32) 1 − n (cid:88) i = 1 j i (cid:33) = 0 ( A . 1 . 8 ) Therefore c j 1 , . . . , j n = 0 when (cid:80) ni = 1 j i (cid:54) = 1 , and analytic solutions for ( 3 . 2 . 16 ) can only contain linear coeﬃcients of ( y i − x i ) in their series expansion . Let k ∈ [ n ] . when j k = 1 we denote c j 1 , . . . , j 2 n ≡ c k , j n + 1 , . . . , j 2 n .

A . 2 . Binary Attributes Appendices A . 2 . 1 . The Binary Attributes Model Claim 3 . 4 . 1 . Let I ⊆ [ n ] . For every vector u I ∈ U I : Pr ( U I = u I ) = 2 − dim ( U I ) ( 3 . 4 . 3 ) Proof of Claim 3 . 4 . 1 . Without loss of generality assume that I = { 1 , . . . , | I | } , and choose a basis U = span { ¯ u 1 , . . . , ¯ u k } which is diagonalized . Each vector in U can be represented as linear combination of basis elements . By deﬁnition , only only the ﬁrst dim ( U I ) diagonalized basis vectors have support in I , and therefore every vector in U I can be written as a linear combination of the view of the ﬁrst dim U I basis vectors of U : ∀ u I ∈ U I , ∃ α 1 , . . . , α dim ( U I ) : u I = dim ( U I ) (cid:88) i = 1 α i ( ¯ u i ) (cid:23) I ( A . 2 . 1 ) Picking u at random is equivalent to choosing each α i uniformly , or equivalently , pick - ing (cid:0) α 1 , . . . , α dim ( U I ) (cid:1) ∼ Uniform (cid:16) { 0 , 1 } dim ( U I ) (cid:17) . From this correspondence it follows that Pr ( u I ) = Pr (cid:0) α 1 , . . . , α dim ( U I ) (cid:1) = 2 − dim ( U I ) . Claim 3 . 4 . 2 . Let I ⊆ [ n ] and m ∈ [ n ] \ I , and assume a vector u ∈ F n 2 has been picked uniformly at random from a vector space U . Pr ( u m | u I ) is a singleton distribution if and only if e m ∈ U ⊥ (cid:23) [ n ] \ I . Proof of Claim 3 . 4 . 2 . When e m ∈ U ⊥ (cid:23) [ n ] \ I there exists a vector v ∈ U ⊥ and I (cid:48) ⊆ I such that support ( v ) = { m } ∪ I (cid:48) . v is a dual - space vector , and therefore (cid:80) i ∈ I (cid:48) u i + u m = 0 . The value u m ∈ { 0 , 1 } is completely determined by the values of u I (cid:48) , and therefore Pr ( u m | u I ) is a singleton distribution . 47 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 Conversely , observe that restricting a vector to a subset of coordinates I ⊆ [ n ] can be viewed as a linear projection operation P I ≡ (cid:80) i ∈ I e i e Ti . Let v ∈ U be a vector for which v I = u I . The set of vectors u (cid:48) ∈ U for which u (cid:48) I = u I is an aﬃne subspace U (cid:48) of U : U (cid:48) = v + V (cid:48) = (cid:8) v + v (cid:48) | v (cid:48) ∈ U , P I v (cid:48) = 0 (cid:9) ( A . 2 . 2 ) Note that V (cid:48) is a linear subspace of U , and therefore : (cid:0) V (cid:48) (cid:1) ⊥ = span (cid:16) U ⊥ ∪ { e i | i ∈ I } (cid:17) ( A . 2 . 3 ) Using the assumption that Pr ( u m | u I ) is a singleton distribution , we get that the m - th co - ordinate is constant in U (cid:48) , and therefore P { m } V (cid:48) = 0 , and e m ∈ ( V (cid:48) ) ⊥ . denote U ⊥ = span (cid:8) ¯ u ⊥ 1 , . . . , ¯ u ⊥ n − k (cid:9) . Using ( A . 2 . 3 ) we can write e m as a linear combination of spanning set elements : e m = | I | (cid:88) i = 1 α i e i + n − k (cid:88) j = 1 β j ¯ u ⊥ j ( A . 2 . 4 ) Restricting the view to coordinates [ n ] \ I , the terms in the ﬁrst sum vanish , yielding : e m = P [ n ] \ I e m = n − k (cid:88) j = 1 β j P [ n ] \ I ¯ u ⊥ j ( A . 2 . 5 ) We have shown that it’s possible to write e m as a linear combination of punctured dual space elements , hence e m ∈ U ⊥ (cid:23) [ n ] \ I . Claim 3 . 4 . 3 . Let U be a linear space over F 2 n , and let I ⊆ [ n ] , m ∈ [ n ] \ I . e m ∈ U ⊥ (cid:23) [ n ] \ I if and only if dim ( U (cid:23) I ) = dim (cid:0) U (cid:23) I ∪ { m } (cid:1) . Proof of Claim 3 . 4 . 3 . Assume a uniform distribution over U , then e m ∈ U ⊥ (cid:23) [ n ] \ I , if and only if Pr ( u m | u I ) is a singleton distribution by Claim 3 . 4 . 2 . According to the law of total probability , Pr ( u m | u I ) is a singleton distribution if and only if the following marginal distributions are equal : Pr (cid:0) u I ∪ { m } (cid:1) = Pr ( u I ) . Using Claim 3 . 4 . 1 we obtain that the two probabilites are equal if and only if dim ( U (cid:23) I ) = dim (cid:0) U (cid:23) I ∪ { m } (cid:1) . A . 2 . 2 . Retention Complexity of the Walsh - Hadamard Code Claim 3 . 4 . 4 . Let y ( 1 ) , . . . , y ( m ) ∈ (cid:16) { 0 , 1 } k \ (cid:8) 0 k (cid:9)(cid:17) . (cid:32) m (cid:88) i = 1 e y ( i ) (cid:33) ∈ WH ⊥ ⇐⇒ m (cid:88) i = 1 y ( i ) = 0 ( 3 . 4 . 11 ) Proof of Claim 3 . 4 . 4 . By deﬁnition , (cid:16)(cid:80) mi = 1 e y ( i ) (cid:17) ∈ WH ⊥ if and only if (cid:16)(cid:80) mi = 1 e y ( i ) (cid:17) · u = 0 for all u ∈ WH . For an arbitrary u , let w ∈ { 0 , 1 } k such that u = WH ( w ) . Plug into the deﬁnition 48 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc . Thesis MSC - 2018 - 16 - 2018 of WH and obtain : (cid:32) m (cid:88) i = 1 e y ( i ) (cid:33) · u = m (cid:88) i = 1 u y ( i ) = m (cid:88) i = 1 w · y ( i ) = w · (cid:32) m (cid:88) i = 1 y ( i ) (cid:33) Observe that the inner product is equal to zero for all u ∈ WH if and only if w · (cid:0)(cid:80) mi = 1 y ( i ) (cid:1) for all w ∈ { 0 , 1 } k . This happens if and only if (cid:0)(cid:80) mi = 1 y ( i ) (cid:1) = 0 , proving our claim . Claim 3 . 4 . 5 . d (cid:16) WH ⊥ (cid:17) = 3 ( 3 . 4 . 12 ) Proof of Claim 3 . 4 . 5 . By Claim 3 . 4 . 4 , the vectors corresponding to the support of each con - straint in WH ⊥ must have their XORs equal to zero . 0 k / ∈ (cid:16) { 0 , 1 } k \ (cid:8) 0 k (cid:9)(cid:17) , and therefore there are no constraints of size 1 , and we have d (cid:0) WH ⊥ (cid:1) > 1 . Similarly , for all x , y ∈ (cid:16) { 0 , 1 } k \ (cid:8) 0 k (cid:9)(cid:17) such that x (cid:54) = y we get x + y (cid:54) = 0 , and therefore there are no constraints of size 2 , and d (cid:0) WH ⊥ (cid:1) > 2 . Taking x (cid:54) = y and z = x + y gives 3 coordinates with corresponding vectors that sum up to zero , and therefore d (cid:0) WH ⊥ (cid:1) ≤ 3 according to Claim 3 . 4 . 4 . Combining the conclusions we obtain d (cid:0) WH ⊥ (cid:1) = 3 . 49 Technion - Computer Science Department - M . Sc .
