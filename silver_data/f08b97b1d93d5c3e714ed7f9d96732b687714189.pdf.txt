The search system learns the user intent based on this feedback and employs it to recommend novel results . However , the amount of user feedback is very limited compared to the size of the information space to be explored . To tackle this problem , we take into account user feedback on both the retrieved items ( documents ) and their features ( keywords ) . In order to combine feedback from multiple domains , we introduce a coupled multi - armed bandits algorithm , which employs a probabilistic model of the relationship between the domains . Simulation results show that with multi - domain feedback , the search system can find the relevant items in fewer iterations than with only one domain . A preliminary user study indicates improvement in user satisfaction and quality of retrieved information .

INTRODUCTION The dominant information retrieval paradigm relies on the user’s ability to form a precise query , which is difficult at least in the about 50 % of search sessions where the user is uncertain about her information need [ 17 ] . Furthermore , the information need can shape throughout the search session . For instance , when the user prepares for writing a summary about a particular topic , the search process typically takes several iterations in which the user directs the search by tuning the initial query and the initial search intent , after observing the results . This important type of a search scenario is called exploratory search [ 10 , 12 , 18 ] . There is a wide variety of qualitative definitions of exploratory search [ 19 ] . Marchionini [ 12 ] illustrated exploratory and lookup tasks as an overlapping cloud and suggested that lookup tasks are embedded in exploratory tasks and vice versa . The problem context that motivates the search process is typically characterized in definitions of exploratory search [ 18 ] . Imprecise task requirements or open - ended search goals are the two primary attributes often used to define exploratory search with respect to the problem context [ 11 ] . The exploratory search process is considered to be cognitively complex with the information seeker being uncertain about the search process [ 18 ] . To help the user in exploratory search , her interactions with the system can be employed to infer her search intent . This is challenging for two reasons . First , active interaction is required from the user ; however , users are often not willing to invest in actively giving feedback to search systems . Second , even if the interface was appealing enough , the user can only provide a limited amount of feedback , which makes user intent modelling challenging . In this paper we make it easier for the user to give feedback in exploratory search , by allowing feedback on multiple domains , in this case keywords and documents . For this we formulate the user intent modelling task as a new coupled multi - armed bandit problem , instead of using only one multi - armed bandit for one modality as in earlier approaches [ 14 ] . The rest of the paper is organized as follows : First we model exploratory search as a learning problem with limited feedback . Next , we propose the coupled multi - armed bandits algorithm that employs Thompson sampling with a novel probabilistic user model . We conclude the paper by evaluating the proposed method in a simulation scenario and a user study . PROPOSED APPROACH Problem Setting Let 𝐷𝐷 be a set of documents in a corpus and 𝐾𝐾 be a set of keywords extracted from these documents . For each user , it is assumed that the relevance of each document 𝑑𝑑 ∈ 𝐷𝐷 is an unknown distribution over [ 0 , 1 ] . This distribution encodes the uncertainty of the user about the relevance of each item , which is a key element of exploratory search .

The document 𝑑𝑑 ∈ 𝐷𝐷 is more relevant than 𝑑𝑑 ′ ∈ 𝐷𝐷 , if 𝐸𝐸 𝐷𝐷 [ 𝑑𝑑 ′ ] < 𝐸𝐸 𝐷𝐷 [ 𝑑𝑑 ] . Similarly , it is assumed that the relevance of each keyword 𝑘𝑘 ∈ 𝐾𝐾 is an unknown distribution over [ 0 , 1 ] with its expected relevance denoted by 𝐸𝐸 𝐾𝐾 [ 𝑘𝑘 ] . We call this set of distributions the user intent model . The expected relevances of keywords and documents are connected through a model of the data that defines how keywords belong to documents . In each session , a user with a fixed but unknown intent model arrives . Each session consists of 𝑁𝑁 iterations . In each iteration , the user provides input based on her intent model as relevance values to keywords and documents , and the algorithm provides a set of new documents and keywords . It is assumed that user feedback consists of samples from the relevance distributions . The retrieval system should look for the most relevant document 𝑑𝑑 ∗ = argmax 𝑑𝑑∈𝐷𝐷 𝐸𝐸 𝐷𝐷 [ 𝑑𝑑 ] and present it to the user . To solve this maximization the system needs to explore the document space to estimate the expected relevance of documents based on user feedback . At the same time it should exploit the estimates to show relevant documents as early as possible . This kind of a black box optimization problem , where the objective function is unknown and expensive to sample , has been studied in multi - armed bandit [ 6 ] and Bayesian optimization [ 4 , 16 ] literature . A natural performance criterion for these problems is regret , which is the loss due to not presenting the most relevant documents to the user . The cumulative regret after receiving feedback for a set of documents 𝑛𝑛 𝐷𝐷 is 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 _ 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = | 𝑛𝑛 𝐷𝐷 | 𝐸𝐸 𝐷𝐷 [ 𝑑𝑑 ∗ ] − ∑ 𝐸𝐸 𝐷𝐷 [ 𝑑𝑑 ] 𝑑𝑑∈𝑛𝑛 𝐷𝐷 . The goal is to minimize the cumulative regret , which is equivalent to maximizing the sum of expected relevance feedback on documents in 𝑛𝑛 𝐷𝐷 . However , since the expected relevance of documents is hidden to the system , this measure cannot be calculated in practice . In practice , an exploratory search system is successful if it presents to the user items , e . g . documents , that the user finds interesting . How we measure this “interest” is through maximizing the average number of clicks ( or other types of positive relevance feedback ) on documents in 𝑁𝑁 iterations [ 15 ] . Since it is reasonable to assume that the user provides positive feedback mostly on relevant documents , this user behavior model also minimizes the cumulative regret defined from the theory point of view . By modeling the problem as regret minimization , there is little hope to achieve a reasonable result by only considering the limited feedback on documents . In exploratory search , it is more convenient for the user to express the abstract understanding of her needs in terms of higher - level information , such as a set of keywords . In this paper we take advantage of both feedback on documents and on keywords in order to improve the regret of an exploratory search system . We tackle the problem by modeling it as coupled multi - armed bandits where it is possible to provide feedback both to the arms and the features defining the arms . In our exploratory search problem , the arms are documents and the features are keywords defining the documents . Connecting Documents and Keywords We assume there exists a document - keyword matrix 𝑀𝑀 defined as 𝑀𝑀 = � 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝑘𝑘 1 | 𝑑𝑑 1 ) ⋯ 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝑘𝑘 | 𝐾𝐾 | | 𝑑𝑑 1 ) ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝑘𝑘 1 | 𝑑𝑑 | 𝐷𝐷 | ) ⋯ 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝑘𝑘 | 𝐾𝐾 | | 𝑑𝑑 | 𝐷𝐷 | ) � | 𝐷𝐷 | × | 𝐾𝐾 | where 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝑘𝑘 𝑖𝑖 | 𝑑𝑑 𝑗𝑗 ) specifies the likelihood of document 𝑑𝑑 𝑗𝑗 generating keyword 𝑘𝑘 𝑖𝑖 . This matrix is generated from the data model that expresses how keywords and the documents are related . An example , which we use , is to consider documents as bags of words and to use normalized tf - idf representations of documents . We make the simplifying assumption that the connection between expected relevance of a document and keywords is as follows : 𝐸𝐸 𝐷𝐷 [ 𝑑𝑑 𝑗𝑗 ] = � 𝐸𝐸 𝐾𝐾 [ 𝑘𝑘 𝑖𝑖 ] 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝑘𝑘 𝑖𝑖 | 𝑑𝑑 𝑗𝑗 ) | 𝐾𝐾 | 𝑖𝑖 = 1 With the compact notation 𝐸𝐸 𝐷𝐷 [ 𝐷𝐷 ] = �𝐸𝐸 𝐷𝐷 [ 𝑑𝑑 1 ] , … , 𝐸𝐸 𝐷𝐷 �𝑑𝑑 | 𝐷𝐷 | �� 𝑇𝑇 , and analogously for keywords , this becomes 𝐸𝐸 𝐷𝐷 [ 𝐷𝐷 ] = 𝑀𝑀𝐸𝐸 𝐾𝐾 [ 𝐾𝐾 ] ( 1 ) Note that we made the simplifying assumptions only for the expected relevances ; the shapes of the relevance distributions can be different . Coupled Bayesian Bandits The user provides relevance feedback to both documents and keywords . The relevance ( reward ) distributions for document 𝑑𝑑 and keyword 𝑘𝑘 are denoted by 𝑟𝑟 𝑑𝑑 ~ 𝑓𝑓 𝐷𝐷 ( . | 𝑥𝑥 𝑑𝑑 , 𝜃𝜃 ) and 𝑟𝑟 𝑘𝑘 ~ 𝑓𝑓 𝐾𝐾 ( . | 𝑥𝑥 𝑘𝑘 , 𝜃𝜃 ) , respectively . The 𝑥𝑥 𝑑𝑑 and 𝑥𝑥 𝑘𝑘 are the feature ( context ) vectors associated with 𝑑𝑑 and 𝑘𝑘 . The fixed but unknown parameter 𝜃𝜃 defines the shared link between these two relevance distributions . After the user has interacted with a set of documents 𝑛𝑛 𝐷𝐷 and a set of keywords 𝑛𝑛 𝐾𝐾 , we can write the posterior at time 𝑟𝑟 = | 𝑛𝑛 𝐷𝐷 | + | 𝑛𝑛 𝐾𝐾 | as 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡 ( 𝜃𝜃 ) ∝ 𝜋𝜋 0 ( 𝜃𝜃 ) ∏ 𝑓𝑓 𝐷𝐷 ( 𝑟𝑟 𝑑𝑑 | 𝑥𝑥 𝑑𝑑 , 𝜃𝜃 ) 𝑑𝑑∈𝑛𝑛 𝐷𝐷 ∏ 𝑓𝑓 𝐾𝐾 ( 𝑟𝑟 𝑘𝑘 | 𝑥𝑥 𝑘𝑘 , 𝜃𝜃 ) 𝑘𝑘∈𝑛𝑛 𝐾𝐾 , ( 2 ) where 𝜋𝜋 0 ( 𝜃𝜃 ) is the prior distribution for 𝜃𝜃 . In order to apply Bayesian bandit methods [ 1 , 9 ] it is only necessary to be able to perform the following two steps : draw a sample from the posterior at time 𝑟𝑟 , and after that score all the documents and keywords by 𝐸𝐸 𝐷𝐷 [ 𝑟𝑟 𝑑𝑑 | 𝑥𝑥 𝑑𝑑 , 𝜃𝜃 𝑝𝑝 ] and 𝐸𝐸 𝐾𝐾 [ 𝑟𝑟 𝑘𝑘 | 𝑥𝑥 𝑘𝑘 , 𝜃𝜃 𝑝𝑝 ] . These two steps are the minimum requirements for employing the Thompson sampling algorithm for bandits [ 1 , 7 , 9 ] . In Thompson sampling , the exploration and exploitation are controlled indirectly by the uncertainty in the posterior . We can easily draw a sample from the posterior by using any sampling method , after specifying the shared parameter 𝜃𝜃 that connects the relevance distributions , and the feature vectors 𝑥𝑥 𝑑𝑑 and 𝑥𝑥 𝑘𝑘 . These parameters are defined by the user model . IUI 2016 • User Modelling March 7 – 10 , 2016 , Sonoma , CA , USA 72 Figure 1 . Probabilistic model for user feedback on documents and keywords . Probabilistic User Model We propose a simple model for received relevance feedback on documents and keywords . Since the amount of feedback from the user is limited , we need to impose a structure on the expected relevance of items to be able to generalize well . We assume that the expected relevance of keywords is linearly related to their feature vectors by the unknown weight vector 𝜃𝜃 , i . e . 𝐸𝐸 𝐾𝐾 [ 𝐾𝐾 ] = 𝑀𝑀 𝑇𝑇 𝜃𝜃 . Based on this linearity assumption and our previous assumption in equation ( 1 ) , we have 𝐸𝐸 𝐷𝐷 [ 𝐷𝐷 ] = 𝑀𝑀𝐸𝐸 𝐾𝐾 [ 𝐾𝐾 ] = 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 𝑇𝑇 𝜃𝜃 . Using this feature transformation , we only need to estimate one set of unknown weights to specify expected relevance of both documents and keywords . Considering Gaussian distributions for relevance , we propose the following model ( plate diagram in Figure 1 ) : 𝑓𝑓 𝐾𝐾 ( 𝑟𝑟 𝑘𝑘 | 𝑥𝑥 𝑘𝑘 , 𝜃𝜃 , 𝛽𝛽 𝐾𝐾 ) = 𝑁𝑁 ( 𝑟𝑟 𝑘𝑘 ; 𝑥𝑥 𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 𝜃𝜃 , 𝛽𝛽 𝐾𝐾2 ) 𝑓𝑓 𝐷𝐷 ( 𝑟𝑟 𝑑𝑑 | 𝑥𝑥 𝑑𝑑 , 𝜃𝜃 , 𝛽𝛽 𝐷𝐷 ) = 𝑁𝑁 ( 𝑟𝑟 𝑑𝑑 ; 𝑥𝑥 𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 𝜃𝜃 , 𝛽𝛽 𝐷𝐷2 ) 𝜋𝜋 0 ( 𝜃𝜃 ) = 𝑁𝑁 ( 𝜃𝜃 ; 0 , 𝜂𝜂 2 Ι ) Here , 𝑥𝑥 𝑘𝑘 is the 𝑘𝑘 𝑡𝑡ℎ column of 𝑀𝑀 and 𝑥𝑥 𝑑𝑑 is the 𝑑𝑑 𝑡𝑡ℎ column of 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 𝑇𝑇 ; they define feature vectors for keyword 𝑘𝑘 and document 𝑑𝑑 , respectively . Since all the distributions are Gaussian , the posterior is also a Gaussian distribution , with : 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡 ( 𝜃𝜃 ) = 𝑁𝑁 ( 𝜃𝜃 ; 𝜇𝜇 𝑡𝑡 , Σ 𝑡𝑡 ) Σ 𝑡𝑡−1 = 𝛽𝛽 𝐷𝐷−2 𝑋𝑋 𝑛𝑛 𝐷𝐷 𝑇𝑇 𝑋𝑋 𝑛𝑛 𝐷𝐷 + 𝛽𝛽 𝐾𝐾−2 𝑋𝑋 𝑛𝑛 𝐾𝐾 𝑇𝑇 𝑋𝑋 𝑛𝑛 𝐾𝐾 + 𝜂𝜂 −2 Ι ( 3 ) 𝜇𝜇 𝑡𝑡 = Σ 𝑡𝑡 �𝛽𝛽 𝐷𝐷−2 𝑋𝑋 𝑛𝑛 𝐷𝐷 𝑇𝑇 𝑅𝑅 𝑛𝑛 𝐷𝐷 + 𝛽𝛽 𝐾𝐾−2 𝑋𝑋 𝑛𝑛 𝐾𝐾 𝑇𝑇 𝑅𝑅 𝑛𝑛 𝐾𝐾 � where 𝑋𝑋 𝑛𝑛 𝐷𝐷 is a | 𝑛𝑛 𝐷𝐷 | × 𝐷𝐷 design matrix containing feature vectors for the observed documents in the set 𝑛𝑛 𝐷𝐷 , and 𝑅𝑅 𝑛𝑛 𝐷𝐷 is a | 𝑛𝑛 𝐷𝐷 | × 1 matrix of the corresponding observed relevance values . With the same logic , 𝑋𝑋 𝑛𝑛 𝐾𝐾 is a | 𝑛𝑛 𝐾𝐾 | × 𝐷𝐷 design matrix containing feature vectors for the observed keywords in the set 𝑛𝑛 𝐾𝐾 , and 𝑅𝑅 𝑛𝑛 𝐾𝐾 is a | 𝑛𝑛 𝐾𝐾 | × 1 matrix of the corresponding observed relevance values . The computational complexity of ( 3 ) comes from the covariance matrix inversion . The coupled multi - armed bandits algorithm employing Thompson sampling for controlling exploration - exploitation tradeoff is as follows : ALGORITHM 1 : Coupled multi - armed bandits At time step 𝑟𝑟 1 . draw 𝜃𝜃 𝑝𝑝 ~ 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡 ( 𝜃𝜃 ) from ( 3 ) 2 . for document bandit : select 𝑑𝑑 + = argmax 𝑑𝑑∈𝐷𝐷 𝑥𝑥 𝑑𝑑𝑇𝑇 𝜃𝜃 𝑝𝑝 3 . for keyword bandit : select 𝑘𝑘 + = argmax 𝑘𝑘∈𝐾𝐾 𝑥𝑥 𝑘𝑘𝑇𝑇 𝜃𝜃 𝑝𝑝 4 . update the posterior ( 3 ) based on user feedback and observed feature vectors SIMULATION In each exploratory search session , the simulator considers a small set of documents and keywords as targets , and assumes their expected relevance to be 1 . The simulated user employs Latent Semantic Indexing ( LSI ) and cosine similarity measure to calculate similarities to the targets for all documents and keywords . According to these similarities , an expected relevance value in [ 0 , 1 ] is assigned to each document and keyword , defining 𝐸𝐸 𝐷𝐷 [ 𝐷𝐷 ] and 𝐸𝐸 𝐾𝐾 [ 𝐾𝐾 ] . In each iteration , the algorithm presents five documents and five keywords to the user ( by repeating steps 2 and 3 of Algorithm 1 ) . We assume that the simulated user selects document 𝑑𝑑 as relevant with probability equal to relevance value 𝑟𝑟 𝑑𝑑 ~ 𝑁𝑁 ( 𝐸𝐸 𝐷𝐷 [ 𝑑𝑑 ] , 𝛽𝛽 𝐷𝐷2 ) , and provides relevance feedback 𝑟𝑟 𝑘𝑘 ~ 𝑁𝑁 ( 𝐸𝐸 𝐾𝐾 [ 𝑘𝑘 ] , 𝛽𝛽 𝐾𝐾2 ) for keyword 𝑘𝑘 with probability proportional to | 𝑟𝑟 𝑘𝑘 − 0 . 5 | . The motivation is that users usually give feedback to keywords that are highly relevant or irrelevant . We used a fixed pool of 750 computer science arXiv articles , with only 50 of them having high expected relevance in the user intent model . The model parameters were set to 𝛽𝛽 𝐷𝐷 = 𝛽𝛽 𝑘𝑘 = 0 . 3 and 𝜂𝜂 = 0 . 5 . We compared our method with variants that only consider feedback on keywords or documents to update the posterior ( 3 ) . Based on the simulation result in Figure 2 , we can conclude that considering feedback on both documents and keywords will significantly increase the number of relevant items that the user can find with the same number of iterations . Figure 2 . Histogram for 100 independent runs of the methods . The sum of expected relevanc es of selected documents after 10 iterations is significantly higher when both types of feedback ( doc + key ) are considered . IUI 2016 • User Modelling March 7 – 10 , 2016 , Sonoma , CA , USA 73 USER EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS We implemented the proposed method in an existing exploratory search system SciNet [ 8 ] . SciNet uses the LinRel algorithm [ 2 ] to learn the user intent model based on feedback on keywords visualized on a radar - like interface . In our implementation , we replaced LinRel with Algorithm 1 . Furthermore , user interactions with documents , i . e . clicks or bookmarks , are considered as relevance feedback on documents , in addition to feedback on keywords . The computational complexity of both algorithms is the same . We conducted a preliminary user study on 10 university students and researchers . All the participants were fluent in English and had some background in computer science or a related field . Each participant performed two exploratory tasks in which they had to do a literature survey on a topic and answer three questions in a fixed amount of time . The topics were reinforcement learning and neural networks . The participants reported their knowledge of the topics on 1 - 5 Likert scale ( with 2 . 2 on average ) . The user interface and real time performance of the systems were identical , and the participants were naïve about which exploratory search engine was used for each task . In each iteration , five documents were shown to the user and the user could bookmark the relevant ones . All user interactions were logged by the system including the typed query , documents and keywords presented to the user , and documents and keywords that the user interacted with . After each task the participants answered a questionnaire containing SUS [ 5 ] and a short version of ResQue [ 13 ] using 1 - 5 Likert scale , where 1 indicates “strongly disagree” . A short interview with each participant was conducted after the tasks . Answers to all the tasks and the bookmarked documents were rated by experts in a double - blind assessment using a scale from 0 ( no answer ) to 5 ( perfect answer ) . All the shown documents were assessed on a binary scale based on their relevance to the search topic . The inter - rater agreement between the experts showed that the rankings overlapped more than 80 % . One of the users was excluded from the analysis because he did not bookmark any article . Table 1 summarises different performance measures for the proposed algorithm and the baseline system . The percentage of all the shown articles that were labelled as relevant by the experts was calculated as a measure of the quality of the shown information . For the proposed system this value was 5 percent better compared to the baseline . However , the difference was not statistically significant .

P erformance measures for the proposed and baseline systems . The better value on each row is shown in bold . The proposed algorithm had better SUS and ResQue scores compared to the baseline . However , due to the small sample size these differences were not statistically significant . It should be noted that most of the questions in SUS and ResQue target areas such as user interface , which was the same in both systems . There are two questions in ResQue that measure the novelty and diversity of search results [ 13 ] : The recommender system helped me discover new items and The items recommended to me are diverse . In both questions the proposed method scored higher ( 4 . 1 and 3 . 7 ) against the baseline system ( 3 . 5 and 3 . 3 ) . User task performance was measured by averaging the expert assessments of the answers for the three questions in each task . The users were hard pressed to gather a report in time , which was also evident in their answers . In these reports both systems achieved the same average performance . In the interviews , 6 out of 9 users reported higher satisfaction with the proposed system ( more diversity and better results ) , one reported that he could not tell the difference , and two said that the baseline was better . Overall , the preliminary results indicate that the proposed system gave the users a more satisfying image of the topic they were exploring . Furthermore , the usability of the total system has also improved . DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION In this paper we introduced the coupled multi - armed bandits algorithm as the exploratory search method that employs the user feedback on both the retrieved items and their features . Our approach is based on two main ideas . First , we model user behavior as a generative probabilistic model . Second , we couple different sources of feedback in a unified model . Our simulation results and preliminary user study indicate that considering these two sources of feedback can improve the performance and quality of the exploratory search . From the practical point of view , our algorithm provides the opportunity to exploit several types of relevance feedback that are available for documents , in addition to relevance feedback available for individual keywords . For example in [ 3 ] it was shown that it is possible to detect implicit relevance feedback from physiological signals such as electrodermal activity and facial electromyography on documents . We believe that this is an important step for the future of exploratory search applications since an increasing amount of research studies the feasibility of performing information retrieval based on novel types of relevance signals both on keywords and on documents .
