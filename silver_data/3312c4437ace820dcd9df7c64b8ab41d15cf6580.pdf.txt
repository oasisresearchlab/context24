However , the mechanisms by which cells maintain steady - state EGFR expression remain poorly understood . Here , we report a novel role of Golgi - localized , γ - adaptin ear - containing , ADP ribosylation factor - binding protein 2 ( GGA2 ) in the control of EGFR turnover . Whereas GGA1 - or GGA3 - depletion increased EGFR expression , GGA2 - depletion by RNAi greatly reduced steady - state expression of EGFR , reflecting enhanced lysosomal degradation of EGFR . Subsequent pull - down assays showed interactions of VHS - GAT domains from three GGAs with the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region ( jxt ) of EGFR , which was dependent on N108 in the VHS domain . Proximity ligation assay also revealed the steady - state interaction between GGA2 and EGFR in situ . Moreover , reduced expression of EGFR in GGA2 - depleted cells was reversed by additional depletion of GGA1 or GGA3 , suggesting that GGA1 and GGA3 promote EGFR degradation . In addition , GGA2 - depleted cells had reduced EGF signaling and cell proliferation in cell culture and xenograft experiments . Finally , GGA2 was upregulated in 30 . 8 % of human hepatocellular carcinomas and 23 . 3 % of colorectal cancers . Together , these results indicate that GGA2 supports cell growth by interacting with EGFR for sustaining the receptor expression . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ; also known as ErbB1 or Her1 ) is a receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) that is involved in eukaryotic development and cancer pathogenesis 1 . Several sequential and parallel events reportedly occur upon EGF binding , including EGFR dimerization and activation of signal cascades , endocytosis , ubiquiti - nation , recycling back to plasma membrane , sorting into inner vesicles of multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) , and lys - osomal degradation , and these processes of maintenance and suppression of EGFR have been documented under EGF signaling conditions 2 , 3 . However , the regulatory mechanisms of steady - state EGFR expression in the absence of EGF stimulation remain poorly understood . Although this concept has been overlooked , it has become evident that gene amplification , overexpression , mutation , and aberrant activation of EGFR are frequently found in many human cancers 4 . The GGA proteins GGA1 , GGA2 , and GGA3 are a family of ubiquitously expressed ADP ribosylation factor ( ARF ) - dependent monomeric clathrin adaptors that are conserved from yeast to humans . All GGA proteins comprise three folded domains of VHS , GAT , and GAE and a hinge domain between GAT and GAE . Previous studies have established that the VHS domain binds acidic cluster - dileucine ( ACLL ) sorting signals in the cyto - plasmic domain of cargoes and that the GAT domain interacts with class I ARF GTPases that are essential for the recruitment of GGAs onto membranes . Moreover , an unstructured hinge region has been shown to bind clathrin , and the GAE domain reportedly binds a cohort of accessory proteins 5 . These domains mediate trans Golgi net - work ( TGN ) – endosome transport of cargo molecules with ACLL motifs , such as mannose 6 - phosphate receptors ( MPRs ) , sortilin , SorLA / LR11 , LRP - 3 / 9 / 12 , BACE , stabilin - 1 , consortin , and Cl channel 7 5 – 7 . However , various in vivo roles and functional redundancies of GGAs and their cargoes remain poorly understood . Recent studies using knockout mice showed that deficiency of GGA2 but not GGA1 or GGA3 resulted in embryonic or neonatal 1 Department of Anatomy and Histology , Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine , 1 Hikariga - oka , Fukushima City , Fukushima , 960 - 1295 , Japan . 2 Department of Physical Therapy , Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine , 1 - 1 - 20 Daiko - minami , Higashi , Nagoya City , Aichi , 461 - 8673 , Japan .

However , the specific roles of GGA2 in protein transport and the precise causes of death due to GGA2 deficiency are largely unknown . In this study , we determined the effects of GGA knockdown on EGFR trafficking and discovered a novel link between GGA2 and sustained EGFR expression that greatly supports the growth of cells . Results GGA2 - depletion facilitates lysosomal degradation of EGFR via post - Golgi compartments . To determine whether GGA depletion influences the behavior of EGFR , siRNAs with two specific target sequences for each GGA were applied to ARPE - 19 , a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line . EGFR protein expression in western blotting was greatly reduced following GGA2 - depletion ( P < 0 . 001 , n = 4 ) , and was slightly but sig - nificantly increased following GGA1 - ( P < 0 . 05 , n = 3 ) or GGA3 - ( P < 0 . 001 , n = 3 ) depletion ( Fig . 1a and b ) . Subsequently , decreases in EGFR expression in GGA2 - depleted cells were confirmed using immunofluorescence microscopy ( Fig . 1c ) . Surface biotinylation experiments indicated that GGA2 - depletion decreased EGFR expres - sion not only in total lysates but also in the plasma membrane fractions ( Supplementary Fig . S1a ) . Modest expres - sion of HA - tagged GGA2 in GGA2 - depleted cells partially restored EGFR localization to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 1d and e ) , supporting that this effect was not caused by off - target effects of siRNAs . Moreover , pulse - chase experiments with [ 35 S ] - methionine and cysteine followed by immunoprecipitation of EGFR indicated increased turnover rates of EGFR in GGA2 - depleted cells ( Fig . 2a and b ) . Specifically , levels of EGFR mRNA and newly translated EGFR protein were unchanged after GGA2 - depletion ( Supplementary Fig . S1b – d ) . Moreover , treat - ment with lysosomal enzyme inhibitors increased a fraction of cytoplasmic punctate signals double positive for EGFR and cathepsin D , a lysosome marker , in both control and GGA2 - depleted cells ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Fig . S2a and b ) . These results indicate that EGFR is posttranslationally missorted toward lysosomes for degrada - tion in GGA2 - depleted cells . In further experiments , intracellular trafficking of EGFR to lysosomes was investigated in GGA2 - depleted cells by expressing mutant proteins . Overexpression of GGA VHS - GAT reportedly inhibits ARF1 - mediated function of GGAs , leading to retention of MPRs at the TGN 9 , 10 . Overexpression of VHS - GAT from GGA2 in GGA2 - depleted cells increased EGFR expression , which was retained at perinuclear Golgi regions ( Supplementary Fig . S2c ) . These data indicate that transport of EGFR from the ER to Golgi is not affected by GGA2 depletion . In subsequent experiments , endocytic pathways from early endosomes to late endosomes / lys - osomes were perturbed by overexpressing mutant rabs . It has been shown that GFP - Rab5 QL overexpression causes a redistribution of EGFR into enlarged endosomal compartments that also contain markers for early / late endosomes and lysosomes 11 – 13 , and that overexpression of GFP - Rab7 TN impairs biogenesis of late endo - somes / lysosomes 14 , 15 . EGFR expression was restored by concomitant expression of these mutant proteins in GGA2 - depleted cells ( Supplementary Fig . S2d and e ) . More precisely , EGFR was accumulated at abnormal early endosomal structures positive for both EEA1 and cathepsin D by GFP - Rab5 QL overexpression ( Fig . 2d ) , or at aberrant late endosomal structures by GFP - Rab7 TN overexpression ( Fig . 2e ) . Together , these results suggest that EGFR is constitutively transported between post - Golgi compartments before entering lysosomes for degradation in GGA2 - depleted cells . GGA2 VHS - GAT recognizes EGFR juxtamembrane ( jxt ) region . To explore interactions between GGA2 and the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR , we performed GST pull - down assays and observed significant interactions between GST - GGA2 VHS - GAT and the GFP - tagged cytoplasmic region of EGFR , and with endog - enous CIMPR ( Fig . 3b ) . Mutation of the Asn108 residue ( N108A ) , which is required for binding to ACLL in cargoes , also reduced EGFR binding , indicating a dependency on the ACLL recognition site in GGA2 ( Fig . 3b ) . To identify EGFR sites that are recognized by GGA2 VHS - GAT , we examined jxt , kinase , and tail domains of EGFR using GGA2 binding assays ( for domain organizations , see Fig . 3a ) . Pull down experiments showed that only the jxt domain – GGA2 VHS - GAT interaction was N108 dependent ( Fig . 3c ) . In separate experiments , each GAT , GAE , and VHS domain of GGA2 did not interact with the jxt domain ( Fig . 3d ) , and the association of GGA2 VHS - GAT was not affected by the GAT mutations N211A , F280R , R281E , and L293A ( Fig . 3d ) , which reportedly reduce binding of GGAs to ARF1 , rabaptin5 , phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate ( PI4P ) , and ubiquitin , respectively 10 , 16 – 18 . Thus , the VHS domain was required but not sufficient for this interaction . We assume that the addition of N - terminal residues of GAT domain to VHS would restore this binding , as has been reported for CIMPR 19 . Taken together , similar to other ACLL containing cargoes , EGFR jxt domain is recognized by the GGA2 VHS - GAT domain via interactions involving N108 in the VHS domain . GGA2 colocalizes and interacts with EGFR in vivo . In triple labelling experiment , overexpressed GFP - GGA2 was colocalized with EGFR in some intracellular compartments , including the TGN , EEA1 - positive early endosomes ( 58 . 4 ± 11 % ; n = 10 ) and cathepsin D - positive lysosomes ( 13 . 3 ± 11 % ; n = 10 ; Fig . 4a ) . Moreover , very small fractions of endogenous GGA2 colocalized with EGFR in the early endosomes ( Fig . 4b ) . To corroborate interactions between GGA2 and EGFR in situ , we applied the proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) 20 to immunofluorescence microscopy . Definite cytoplasmic signals for GGA2 - EGFR interaction were detected , whereas they were drastically reduced by the knockdown of GGA2 or EGFR ( Fig . 4c ) . This assay also revealed that the distribution pattern was largely different from perinuclear signals for GGA2 - CIMPR interaction ( Fig . 4c ) , suggesting that the GGA2 - EGFR interaction mainly occurs in endosomal structures . These results indicate that GGA2 interacts with EGFR in vivo . GGA1 and GGA3 negatively regulate EGFR protein expression . Previously , GAT domains of GGA1 and GGA3 were shown to interact with ubiquitin 16 , 21 , 22 , and binding of GGA3 to ubiquitinated EGFR reportedly facilitated its lysosomal degradation 16 .

In the present western blotting and immunofluorescence experiments , addi - tional depletion of GGA1 or GGA3 restored EGFR expression in GGA2 - depleted cells ( Fig . 5a and b ) . Moreover , binding assays showed that the EGFR jxt domain was recognized by VHS - GAT from GGA1 and GGA3 , and that the interactions were dependent on N92 and N91 residues , respectively , which are responsible for binding to Figure 4 .

In subsequent experiments , influences of GGA1 - or GGA3 - depletion on the GGA2 - EGFR interaction were investigated using PLA . Knockdown of GGA3 , but not of GGA1 , caused a significant increase in the GGA2 - EGFR interaction ( Fig . 5d and e ) . These observations strongly suggest that the three GGAs can bind to the EGFR jxt domain , and that GGA1 and GGA3 , but not GGA2 , facilitate EGFR transport to lysosomes . GGA2 - depletion suppresses cell growth in vitro and in vivo . In further investigations of the effects of GGA2 - depletion on cell growth , downstream signaling of EGFR was monitored according to MAPK phos - phorylation , which was significantly reduced in GGA2 - depleted ARPE - 19 cells ( Fig . 6a and b ) . To examine cell growth , we selected A549 , ARPE - 19 , HeLa , and LoVo cells , whose growth can be suppressed by an EGFR inhib - itor , cetuximab ( Supplementary Fig . S3a ) . shRNA - GGA2 was then introduced to generate cell lines that consti - tutively deplete GGA2 . All of these cell lines showed decreased EGFR expression ( Supplementary Fig .

These results sug - gest that GGA2 controls cell growth by regulating EGFR expression . GGA2 protein is upregulated in human cancer tissues . In subsequent studies , we investigated the relationship between GGA2 expression and cancer using hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) tissues . Western blot analyses showed that the GGA2 expression was significantly higher ( P < 0 . 05 , Mann - Whitney U - test ) in tumor regions than in non - tumor regions ( Fig . 7a and b ) . However , expression of GGA2 mRNA in corresponding sam - ples did not necessarily increase ( Supplementary Fig . S4c ) . Interestingly , higher expressions of EGFR protein were Figure 6 .

Similarly , expressions of both GGA1 and GGA3 were higher in some tumor regions than in non - tumor regions , but the increases were not statistically significant ( Supplementary Fig . S4a and b ) . Also , mRNA expressions of GGA1 and GGA3 did not correlate with the protein expression levels ( Supplementary Fig . S4c ) . Tissue arrays of HCC and colorectal carcinoma ( CRC ) were then examined by immunohistofluorescence microscopy using specific anti - body against GGA2 ( Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . As shown in Fig . 7c several cytoplasmic punctate signals for GGA2 were detected in 30 . 8 % ( 4 / 13 cases ) of HCC and 23 . 3 % ( 7 / 30 cases ) of CRC cases . These results indicate that higher GGA2 protein expression may support cell growth in significant proportions of HCC and CRC tissues . Discussion The relationship between GGAs and EGFR has been reported for GGA3 , which links ubiquitinated EGFR with ubiquitin sorting machinery at endosomes 16 . In this study , reduced expression of GGA3 resulted in accumulation Figure 7 . Expression of GGA2 in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) and colorectal carcinomas ( CRC ) .

Although we partly confirmed this observation by demon - strating that GGA3 or GGA1 depletion increased cellular EGFR expression , EGFR expression was drastically reduced following GGA2 depletion . To our knowledge , these are the first data to show opposing effects of GGA2 and GGA1 / 3 . Moreover , the present experiments show that all three GGAs interact with the EGFR jxt domain , and that these interactions are dependent on the amino acid that is responsible for recognition of ACLL signals in cargoes . Previous studies have shown that the EGFR jxt domain contains a di - leucine motif at the 679 / 680 ( 679 - LL ) position , which is required for efficient lysosomal degradation of EGFR 23 , 24 . However , 679 - LL does not conform to the consensus ACLL signal ( DXXLL ) for GGAs due to the lack of an N - terminal acidic residue . Moreover , NMR spectroscopy revealed α - helical structural propensities of these residues , which is distinguished from ACLL that are recognized in extended β or β - like conformations 25 . Therefore , although roles of 679 - LL in the interaction of GGAs with EGFR jxt have not been shown , the binding mode may differ from known mecha - nisms , warranting further studies of additional sites that are involved in this interaction . Multiple studies have demonstrated that GGA1 / 3 but not GGA2 recognize ubiquitin 16 , 21 , 22 . Moreover , using crystal structure analyses , Prag et al . 26 showed sequence differences in ubiquitin - binding hydrophobic patches on GAT domains of GGA1 / 3 and GGA2 , potentially reflecting the lower affinity of GGA2 than that of GGA1 / 3 . In the present study , EGFR expression in GGA2 - depleted cells was restored by additional knockdown of GGA1 or GGA3 . Hence , although all three GGAs bind to EGFR jxt domains , GGA1 / 3 but not GGA2 mediates EGFR degradation . Moreover , in situ PLA apparently demonstrated that GGA3 depletion , but unfortunately not GGA1 depletion , caused increased signal for GGA2 - EGFR interaction . Accordingly , these observations suggest that GGA1 / 3 and GGA2 have an opposing function for EGFR degradation via their common binding site in EGFR . Interestingly , this mechanism might proceed under no additional EGF stimulus , which is in contrast to the GGA3 - mediated degradation of ubiquitinated EGFR occurring after administration of EGF 16 . However , it may be possible that the binding of GGA1 / 3 to EGFR jxt domain contributes to the efficient associations between GGA1 / 3 and ubiquitin on EGFR at steady - state for its lysosomal degradation . Other properties that distin - guish GGA2 from GGA1 / 3 have been reported . Among these , GGA2 lacks the autoinhibitory mechanisms that are mediated by interactions between VHS and ACLL in the hinge 27 , 28 and GGA2 is more efficiently enriched in isolated HeLa clathrin coated vesicles than GGA1 / 3 29 , 30 . Although these differences can be applied to the ACLL - containing cargoes , it may somehow link to the interaction between GGA and EGFR jxt domain . It should also be noted that GGA1 appeared to bind the jxt domain with highest affinities among GGAs ( Fig . 5C ) , while depletion of GGA3 , but not GGA1 , affected the PLA signal for GGA2 - EGFR interaction ( Fig . 5d and e ) . Although these results may suggest different behaviors between GGA1 and GGA3 for the binding to jxt domain in vitro and in vivo , the precise mechanisms remain elusive . Moreover , compelling evidence of distinguishing features of GGAs has been shown using GGA - deficient mice 6 , 8 . According to these studies , GGA2 - deficient mice are embryonic or neonatal lethal , whereas GGA1 - or GGA3 - deficient mice lack severe phenotypes . This phenotypic difference may be consistent with the opposing actions of GGA2 and GGA1 / 3 on EGFR stabilization . Potentially , the lack of EGFR and its signaling cascades in GGA2 - deficient embryos and neonates would arrest development , although the ensuing details remain subjects of future studies . To identify sites of GGA2 - affected EGFR trafficking , we demonstrated occasional colocalization of endog - enous GGA2 and EGFR in early endosomes by immunofluorescence , and in situ interaction of both molecules by PLA . The PLA data also indicated that the interaction occurred preferentially in the peripheral area rather than the perinuclear TGN in cells . Moreover , EGFR was successfully trafficked to the endocytic pathway in GGA2 - depleted cells , as indicated by blocked receptor transport in experiments using mutants for Rab5 and Rab7 . Taken with a previous study showing that GGA3 promoted degradation of ubiquitinated EGFR in MVBs 16 , the present data indicate that GGA2 together with GGA1 / 3 might regulate EGFR trafficking in early endosomes / MVBs . Nonetheless , these lines of evidence do not completely exclude the possibility that GGA2 - depletion affects other trafficking machineries . More recently , it has been shown that GGA3 promotes recycling of another RTK , Met , from endosomes in association with gyrating clathrin structures 31 , 32 . It is still an open question if this dynamic structures would be involved in the GGA2 - mediated EGFR stabilization . Finally , we demonstrated GGA2 expression is required for cell growth in vitro and in a xenograft model , and that a significant proportion of HCC ( ~ 31 % ) and CRC cells ( ~ 23 % ) showed higher levels of GGA2 expression . In agreement , overexpression of EGFR protein has been reported in 40 – 70 % of conventional HCC and 35 – 50 % of CRC patients 33 – 35 . However , increased EGFR protein expression did not correlate with oncogenic mutations or increased EGFR copy numbers in previous studies 33 , 36 . Therefore , EGFR overexpression may reflect dysregu - lation of EGFR protein turnover , among other mechanisms . The present results suggest that EGFR is stabilized in cancer cells that overexpress GGA2 , likely supporting growth of HCC and CRC . However , because the pres - ent data also indicated that the protein expressions of GGA1 and / or GGA3 were also increased in some cancer tissues , relative amounts of GGA1 , 2 , and 3 could determine the EGFR stability . Further studies with increasing number of patient cases are required to determine correlations between EGFR and three GGAs in cancer tissues . In our searches of previous DNA microarray analyses , GGA2 was not listed as a significantly upregulated gene in HCC 37 – 43 or CRC 44 – 49 . In agreement with this , our data indicated no correlation of GGA2 protein expression with mRNA expression . Therefore , GGA expression may be primarily regulated by protein turnover mechanisms . To date , some of GGA cargos containing ACLL motifs have also been involved in tumor growth . CIMPR is also known as the IGF2 receptor suppressing cell growth by IGF2 clearance 50 . Sortilin has recently been reported to promote EGFR internalization limiting its signaling 51 . It remains unclear how these mechanisms would affect GGA - mediated EGFR transport and tumor growth in vivo . Taken together , we conclude that GGA2 - assisted stabilization of EGFR contributes to the growth of cells , offering a potential therapeutic target for anticancer drug development . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 11 ScieNTific RepoRts | ( 2018 ) 8 : 1368 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 19542 - 4 Materials and Methods Antibodies and reagents .
