Spatio - Temporal Cellular Dynamics of the Arabidopsis Flagellin Receptor Reveal Activation Status - Dependent Endosomal Sorting C W Martina Beck , Ji Zhou , Christine Faulkner , Daniel MacLean , and Silke Robatzek 1 The Sainsbury Laboratory , Norwich NR4 7UH , United Kingdom The activity of surface receptors is location speci ﬁ c , dependent upon the dynamic membrane traf ﬁ cking network and receptor - mediated endocytosis ( RME ) . Therefore , the spatio - temporal dynamics of RME are critical to receptor function . The plasma membrane receptor FLAGELLIN SENSING2 ( FLS2 ) confers immunity against bacterial infection through perception of ﬂ agellin ( ﬂ g22 ) . Following elicitation , FLS2 is internalized into vesicles . To resolve FLS2 traf ﬁ cking , we exploited quantitative confocal imaging for colocalization studies and chemical interference . FLS2 localizes to bona ﬁ de endosomes via two distinct endocytic traf ﬁ cking routes depending on its activation status . FLS2 receptors constitutively recycle in a Brefeldin A ( BFA ) – sensitive manner , while ﬂ g22 - activated receptors traf ﬁ c via ARA7 / Rab F2b – and ARA6 / Rab F1 – positive endosomes insensitive to BFA . FLS2 endocytosis required a functional Rab5 GTPase pathway as revealed by dominant - negative ARA7 / Rab F2b . Flg22 - induced FLS2 endosomal numbers were increased by Concanamycin A treatment but reduced by Wortmannin , indicating that activated FLS2 receptors are targeted to late endosomes . RME inhibitors Tyrphostin A23 and Endosidin 1 altered but did not block induced FLS2 endocytosis . Additional inhibitor studies imply the involvement of the actin - myosin system in FLS2 internalization and traf ﬁ cking . Altogether , we report a dynamic pattern of subcellular traf ﬁ cking for FLS2 and reveal a de ﬁ ned framework for ligand - dependent endocytosis of this receptor . INTRODUCTION Receptor - mediated endocytosis ( RME ) plays important roles in development , growth , and pathogen defense , regulating the levels and distribution of cell surface receptors ( Geldner and Robatzek , 2008 ; Kleine - Vehn and Friml , 2008 ; Frei dit Frey and Robatzek , 2009 ; Sorkin and von Zastrow , 2009 ) . In plants , these include members of the Leu - rich repeat receptor - like kinase ( RLK ) family , such as BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 ( BRI1 ) , which is responsible for brassinosteroid hormone signaling ( Li and Chory , 1997 ) ; FLAGELLIN SENSING2 ( FLS2 ) , which mediates the perception of a conserved domain of bacterial ﬂ agellin ( Gómez - Gómez and Boller , 2000 ; Chinchilla et al . , 2006 ) ; and BRI1 - ASSOCIATED KINASE1 ( BAK1 ; also called SERK3 for SOMATIC EMBRYO RECEPTOR KINASE3 ) , which forms a complex with BRI1 and FLS2 and is required for downstream signaling ( Li et al . , 2002 ; Chinchilla et al . , 2007b ) . Localization studies using BRI1 fused to the green ﬂ uorescent protein ( GFP ) showed that BRI1 - GFP is found both at the plasma membrane and in endosomal compartments . These endosomal compart - ments can be labeled with the endocytic tracer FM4 - 64 and the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) and early endosome ( EE ) marker VHAa1 ( Geldner et al . , 2007 ) . Subcellular localization of BRI1 is sensitive to Brefeldin A ( BFA ) . BFA is an inhibitor of endosomal recycling to the plasma membrane , acting by targeting the ADP - ribosylation factor – GTP exchange factor GNOM and leading to the accumulation of so - called BFA bodies ( Geldner et al . , 2003 ; Robinson et al . , 2008 ) . Plasma membrane and BFA - sensitive endosomal localization patterns were also described for BAK1 / SERK3 ( Russinova et al . , 2004 ) , SERK1 ( Kwaaitaal et al . , 2005 ) , and the non - Leu - rich repeat RLK CRINKLY4 ( ACR4 ) ( Gifford et al . , 2005 ; Karlova et al . , 2006 ) , demonstrating that many de - scribed receptors undergo constitutive recycling . Coexpression of BRI1 and BAK1 / SERK3 in protoplasts revealed distinct endo - somal populations either containing both receptors together or each individually ( Russinova et al . , 2004 ) . This highlights that RME is directed through different endosomal compartments , and in - tracellular receptor localization is transient in nature and depends on the maturation of these highly dynamic membrane compart - ments along the endocytic pathways ( Robatzek , 2007 ; Geldner and Robatzek , 2008 ; Irani and Russinova , 2009 ) . The nature of these different endosomes and the extent to which they contribute to the receptor ’ s function remain mostly unknown . FLS2 functions as an important cell surface receptor in plant immunity against bacterial infection and triggers plant defenses following elicitation by bacterial ﬂ agellin or the ﬂ agellin - derived peptide ﬂ g22 ( Zipfel et al . , 2004 ) . Impairment of FLS2 in - ternalization correlates with altered ﬂ g22 responses ( Robatzek et al . , 2006 ; Salomon and Robatzek , 2006 ; Chinchilla et al . , 2007a ) . Thus , it is essential to identify the key steps of the en - docytic traf ﬁ cking pathway of FLS2 that can regulate aspects of plant immunity .

FLS2 - GFP is translocated from the plasma membrane into small mobile vesicles only when ﬂ g22 is applied , unlike BRI1 endocytic traf ﬁ cking ( Geldner et al . , 2007 ) , which is constitutive and independent of its ligand brassino - steroid ( Robatzek et al . , 2006 ) . The internalization of FLS2 re - quires BAK1 / SERK3 and can be abolished by single amino acid substitutions in the FLS2 kinase domain that may be subject to posttranslational modi ﬁ cations , such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination ( Robatzek et al . , 2006 ; Salomon and Robatzek , 2006 ; Chinchilla et al . , 2007b ) . Flg22 - induced subcellular traf - ﬁ cking is sensitive to Wortmannin ( Wm ) , a phosphatidylphosphate - 3 - kinase inhibitor that interferes with vesicle formation from the plasma membrane and the maturation of late endosomes ( LEs ) and multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) , resulting in their enlargement ( Tse et al . , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 2009 ) . Considering that ﬂ g22 - activated FLS2 - GFP signals decrease over time and that FLS2 internalization is insensitive to BFA , ligand - induced FLS2 en - dosomal traf ﬁ cking must occur in a different pathway to that of BRI1 . Notably , most RLKs , including BRI1 and BAK1 , carry the conserved tetrapeptide Yxx F motif in their cytoplasmic do - mains , which are known to mediate the endocytosis of cell surface proteins ( Geldner and Robatzek , 2008 ; Reyes et al . , 2011 ) . This motif is not present in FLS2 , providing additional evidence for differences in endosomal traf ﬁ cking between re - ceptors ( Geldner and Robatzek , 2008 ; Reyes et al . , 2011 ) . In plants , the occurrence of endocytic traf ﬁ cking is well es - tablished . A key example is root cell polarity , which is based on the asymmetric localization of the PIN FORMED ( PIN ) proteins ( Kleine - Vehn and Friml , 2008 ) . Plasma membrane – resident PIN proteins enter an endocytic traf ﬁ cking pathway in a clathrin - dependent manner , localize to TGN / EE compartments , and re - cycle through a BFA - sensitive pathway , resulting in their polar localization at one side of the cell ( Geldner et al . , 2001 , 2003 ; Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ) . PIN proteins can also enter endocytosis for vacuolar degradation ( Petrásek et al . , 2006 ; Kleine - Vehn et al . , 2008 ; Laxmi et al . , 2008 ) ; thus , endosomes resemble a population of varying distinct compartments transiently present in speci ﬁ c traf ﬁ cking pathways . Endocytosis of PIN proteins depends on ARA7 / Rab F2b ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2008 ) , and members of this Rab5 GTPase family are known to label distinct endosomal compartments ( Ueda et al . , 2001 ; Ueda and Nakano , 2002 ; Pfeffer , 2005 ) . In Arabidopsis thaliana , the Rab5 homologs ARA6 / Rab F1 and ARA7 / Rab F2b localize to different endo - somal populations with a small degree of overlap ( Ueda et al . , 2004 ; Ebine et al . , 2011 ) . ARA6 / Rab F1 localizes mainly to LE , while ARA7 / Rab F2b is found at both EE and LE compartments , thus representing suitable markers for these endosomal pop - ulations ( Ueda et al . , 2004 ; Ebine et al . , 2011 ) . De ﬁ ning the en - dosomal pathways of cell surface proteins is important for understanding their function , in particular in ligand - induced RLK signaling . In this study , we de ﬁ ned the endocytic traf ﬁ cking pathway of the A . thaliana FLS2 receptor in the absence of ﬂ g22 ligand and upon ﬂ g22 - induced activation . The transient behavior of FLS2 endocytosis raises technical challenges for studying this process in detail . To address this issue , we employed cutting - edge quantita - tive , high - throughput , live - cell imaging techniques and developed EndomembraneQuanti ﬁ er and EndomembraneCoLocQuanti ﬁ er algorithms and software implementations for quantifying and identifying colocalized small membrane objects , respectively . With EndomembraneCoLocQuanti ﬁ er , we were able to follow the spatial and temporal dynamics of FLS2 subcellular traf ﬁ ck - ing in detached Arabidopsis cotyledons by evaluating endo - somal numbers over time compared with those of ARA6 / Rab F1 and ARA7 / Rab F2b endosomal markers . In addition , experi - ments involving FM4 - 64 colocalization and membrane traf ﬁ ck - ing inhibitors showed that activated FLS2 receptors traf ﬁ c along the endosomal pathway and mature into LE / MVB compartments in a BFA - insensitive manner . By contrast , FLS2 recycles via a BFA - sensitive endocytic route in the absence of ﬂ g22 . Overall , our study demonstrates that traf ﬁ cking of FLS2 is subject to targeted endosomal sorting that is dependent on the activation status of the receptor . RESULTS Nonactivated FLS2 Constitutively Recycles via a BFA - Sensitive Endocytic Pathway in a BAK1 - Independent Manner Plasma membrane – resident FLS2 accumulates into mobile vesicles upon elicitation with its ligand ﬂ g22 ( Robatzek et al . , 2006 ) , but in its nonactivated state , FLS2 - GFP is mainly present at the cell surface where it colocalized with the lipophilic dye FM4 - 64 , which stains the plasma membrane ( Figure 1A ) ( Bolte et al . , 2004 ) . Because the constitutive recycling of plasma membrane proteins is a well - known process in plant cells and an essential component of their function and regulation , we exam - ined whether FLS2 - GFP recycles between the plasma membrane and TGN / EE compartments . BFA inhibitor treatments affect se - cretory pathways , and in both root and cotyledon cells cause the accumulation of recycled proteins and TGN / EE but not LE or MVBs in BFA bodies ( see Supplemental Figure 1 online ; Langhans , et al . , 2011 ) . Despite the absence of ﬂ g22 , FLS2 - GFP accumulated in BFA bodies as revealed by FM4 - 64 costaining as a positive marker for plasma membrane – derived EE in Arabi - dopsis cotyledons ( Figure 1A ) . Inhibition of protein synthesis by cyclohexamide treatments ( see Supplemental Figure 2 online ) did not interfere with BFA body accumulation of FLS2 - GFP ( Figure 1A ) . As previously described , BFA treatment did not in - hibit ﬂ g22 - induced FLS2 endocytosis ( Robatzek et al . , 2006 ) , and some endosomes showing FLS2 - GFP signals upon ﬂ g22 treatment did not colocalize with BFA bodies ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . Instead , we observed that ﬂ g22 - induced FLS2 - GFP vesicles localized around the BFA body , similar to patterns of known markers labeling LE compartments in the presence of BFA ( Fig - ures 1A and 1B ; see Supplemental Figure 1 online ) . When treating with BFA and the antagonistic peptide ﬂ g222 , which binds but does not activate FLS2 ( Bauer et al . , 2001 ) , FLS2 - GFP accumu - lated solely in BFA bodies and no additional FLS2 - GFP vesicles were present ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . Furthermore , FLS2 - GFP re - cycling is independent of its coreceptor BAK1 . BFA body accu - mulation occurred in the bak1 - 3 mutant background ( Chinchilla et al . , 2007b ) , whether samples were treated with ﬂ g22 or not ( Figure 1A ) . These data show that nonactivated FLS2 receptors 2 of 15 The Plant Cell are subject to constitutive endocytic cycling between the plasma membrane and EE compartments regardless of BAK1 and that ﬂ g22 - activated FLS2 receptors are likely transported from BFA - insensitive EE compartments to LE / MVBs . Flg22 - Induced FLS2 Vesicles Are Bona Fide Endosomes and Colocalize with LE Compartments To determine the identity of the ﬂ g22 - induced FLS2 vesicles , we investigated colocalization of FLS2 compartments with known endosomal markers . To further examine the utility of the endo - cytic tracer FM4 - 64 in this study , we established that time - dependent staining of different endocytic compartments by this dye is comparable in Arabidopsis cotyledons ( see Supplemental Figure 3 online ) to that observed in protoplasts and roots ( Bolte et al . , 2004 ; Jelínková et al . , 2010 ) . To trace FLS2 - GFP com - partments , we treated cotyledons of Arabidopsis seedlings ex - pressing a functional FLS2 - GFP with ﬂ g22 for 15 min to induce RME ( Göhre et al . , 2008 ) and stained the cotyledons with FM4 - 64 . FLS2 - GFP vesicles colocalized with FM4 - 64 – labeled compart - ments after 30 min of ﬂ g22 treatment ( Figure 2A ) . As FM4 - 64 can only label vesicles that originate from the plasma membrane , this demonstrates that FLS2 - GFP is internalized via endocytic uptake and localized to bona ﬁ de endosomes . Colocalization experi - ments using FLS2 - GFP lines crossed into red ﬂ uorescent protein ( RFP ) - ARA7 / Rab F2b and ARA6 / Rab F1 - RFP – expressing plants revealed considerable overlap of these LE markers with FLS2 - GFP endosomes after 30 to 50 min of ﬂ g22 elicitation ( Figure 2B ) , con ﬁ rming that activated FLS2 receptors are targeted to LE compartments . Activated FLS2 Traf ﬁ cs via ARA6 / Rab F1 – and ARA7 / Rab F2b – Positive Endosomal Compartments in a Time - Dependent Manner Flg22 - induced FLS2 endocytosis is a transient phenomenon . To determine the precise dynamics of its subcellular traf ﬁ cking pathway , we performed detailed time - course analysis . We ap - plied our recently established high - throughput confocal imaging techniques , which successfully allow the quanti ﬁ cation of spot - like structures in images of Arabidopsis leaves ( Salomon et al . , 2010 ) . We developed a new image analysis algorithm called EndomembraneQuanti ﬁ er , which subtracts background signals ( e . g . , those derived from chloroplasts , deeper tissues , and guard cells ) , and detects genuine endomembrane compartment sig - nals with high accuracy ( Figures 3A and 3B ; see Supplemental Figure 4 online and Methods ) . This improves extensively upon our previously described endomembrane script ( Salomon et al . , 2010 ) , which suffered from discovering redundant background signals when monitoring FLS2 - GFP endocytosis ( Chinchilla et al . , 2007b ; Salomon et al . , 2010 ) . Among the new features in EndomembraneQuanti ﬁ er , we included codes to use image ﬁ les acquired with two channels ( GFP and chlorophyll auto ﬂ uorescence ) and to record the time of measurement , which enables the tem - poral analysis of image data sets ( see Supplemental Data Set 1 and Supplemental Table 1 online ) . We applied quantitative imaging to monitor ﬂ g22 - induced FLS2 endocytosis over time . FLS2 - GFP endosomes appeared 30 to 45 min after ﬂ g22 application and their numbers increased signi ﬁ cantly during time , reaching a maxi - mum at 60 to 75 min ( Figures 3C and 3D ) . FLS2 - GFP endosomal numbers then decreased over prolonged incubation times of 90 to 115 min ( Figures 3C and 3D ) . This demonstrates that these endosomes are dynamic and transient . Figure 1 .

FLS2 Endosomal Traf ﬁ cking 3 of 15 To compare FLS2 traf ﬁ cking to that of known endosomal mark - ers , we crossed plants expressing FLS2 - GFP to those expressing RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b or ARA6 / Rab F1 - RFP and developed the EndomembraneCoLocQuanti ﬁ er script to analyze the individual and overlapping endosomal numbers of GFP - and RFP - labeled endo - somes ( Figure 4 ) . The EndomembraneCoLocQuanti ﬁ er algorithm includes a code to use image ﬁ les acquired with three channels ( GFP , RFP , and auto ﬂ uorescence signals ) ( see Supplemental Data Set 2 and Supplemental Table 2 online ) . These features allow the detection of spot - like objects labeled with two different ﬂ uorophores using the coordinates of the detected objects in the two separated channels to make counts of colocalized objects . In this algorithm , the objects are superimposed and all objects in one channel that converge with objects in the second channel are considered colocalized ( see Supplemental Figure 5 online ) . Man - ual reinspection of images using GFP markers in channel one and RFP markers in channel two con ﬁ rmed that overlapping GFP - and RFP - labeled compartments were precisely and robustly identi ﬁ ed by the procedure . EndomembraneCoLocQuanti ﬁ er was applied to maximum projections of 21 planes taken 1 µ m apart and to con - secutive projections of three planes each 1 µ m apart . There was no signi ﬁ cant difference between the percentage of overlapped spots identi ﬁ ed in a maximum projection compared with those identi ﬁ ed in the three plane analyses ( see Supplemental Figures 6A and 6B online ) . However , object detection was more precise and ef ﬁ cient based on maximum projections , which was therefore chosen for our high - throughput colocalization quanti ﬁ cation . Since imaging 21 planes for both GFP and RFP signals occurred consecutively and was associated with a time lapse of 120 ms between each plane , the position of endosomes differed slightly between planes ; thus , we considered endosomes to be colocalized when their outlines either merged completely or simply intersected ( see Supplemental Figure 6C online ) . Quanti ﬁ cation of the endosomal markers revealed signi ﬁ cantly more RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b - than ARA6 / Rab F1 - RFP – labeled compartments ( Figure 4B ) . This is in agreement with previously observed quantitative differences between distinct endomem - brane compartments and the localization patterns described for ARA7 / Rab F2b and ARA6 / Rab F1 ( Salomon et al . , 2010 ; Ebine et al . , 2011 ) . Importantly , transcript levels of both UBQ10 promoter - driven RFP - tagged ARA7 / Rab F2b and ARA6 / Rab F1 are compa - rable between the transgenic lines , and differences in RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b and ARA6 / Rab F1 - RFP protein abundances are likely to re ﬂ ect differences in the respectively labeled endosomal compart - ments ( see Supplemental Figure 7 and Supplemental Methods online ) . Furthermore , FLS2 - GFP is expressed at similar levels in these crossed RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b and ARA6 / Rab F1 - RFP lines . We triggered FLS2 - GFP endocytosis with ﬂ g22 and deter - mined time - dependent colocalization with RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b and ARA6 / Rab F1 - RFP using quantitative imaging . No sig - ni ﬁ cant differences in RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b endosomal numbers were detected during ﬂ g22 elicitation ( Figure 4B ) . At 60 to 75 min , when FLS2 endocytosis was at its maximum , ; 90 % of the FLS2 - GFP endosomes were classi ﬁ ed as colocalized with RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b compartments ( Figure 4C ) . This level of colocalization remained relatively stable over time and showed no signi ﬁ cant decrease up to 120 min upon ﬂ g22 elicitation . By contrast , a sig - ni ﬁ cantly lower proportion of FLS2 - GFP endosomes was classi ﬁ ed as colocalized with ARA6 / Rab F1 - RFP compartments . About 60 % of the FLS2 - GFP and ARA6 / Rab F1 - RFP signal colocalized in the same endosomes from 30 to 45 min to 60 to 75 min after ﬂ g22 elicitation ( Figure 4C ) . This proportion then dropped to 50 % and remained at this level until 120 min . These data demonstrate that during endocytic traf ﬁ cking , ; 50 % of activated FLS2 receptors are constantly in close association with LE compartments . Flg22 - Induced FLS2 Endosomal Traf ﬁ cking Is Differentially Affected by the Inhibitors Tyrphostin A23 , Endosidin 1 , Wortmannin , and Concanamycin A Perturbation by known chemical inhibitors is a well - established approach to probe the endomembrane traf ﬁ cking in a controlled manner and can overcome limitations frequently encountered by genetic analysis of membrane traf ﬁ cking mutants ( Drakakaki et al . , 2009 ; Hicks and Raikhel , 2010 ; Drakakaki et al . , 2011 ) . We used a series of inhibitors combined with quantitative imaging to further dissect the ﬂ g22 - induced FLS2 endocytic pathway . As our colocalization studies revealed FLS2 at LE compartments , we considered inhibitors that can interfere with LE endocytic traf ﬁ cking . Prolonged incubation with the phosphatidylphosphate - 3 - kinase inhibitor Wm caused an enlargement of FLS2 - GFP endosomes ( see Supplemental Figure 8A online ) . Since Wm additionally affects LE / MVBs by inducing homotypic fusions and Figure 2 . FLS2 - GFP Differentially Colocalizes to Known Endosomal Markers . Standard confocal micrographs of Arabidopsis transgenic lines express - ing FLS2 - GFP show optical sections of cotyledon epidermis untreated or treated with ﬂ g22 .

Bar = 10 µ m . 4 of 15 The Plant Cell thereby enlarging these compartments ( see Supplemental Figure 8A online ; Wang et al . , 2009 ) , the observed increase in FLS2 - GFP endosomal size further con ﬁ rms FLS2 traf ﬁ cking via LE compartments . Another effect of Wm is the inhibition of en - docytic uptake at the plasma membrane ( Emans et al . , 2002 ; Ito et al . , 2012 ) . Treatment with Wm also resulted in about a 70 % decrease in ﬂ g22 - induced FLS2 - GFP endosomal numbers ( Figure 5 ; see Supplemental Figure 9 online ) , which shows that FLS2 internalizes from the plasma membrane and is in agreement with previous ﬁ ndings ( Robatzek et al . , 2006 ) . Another well - established membrane traf ﬁ cking inhibitor is Concanamycin A ( ConcA ) , which is known to block vacuolar transport ( Dettmer et al . , 2006 ) . ConcA targets the vacuolar ATPase activity at the TGN / EE , which is required for MVB / LE biogenesis ( Scheuring et al . , 2011 ) . When treated with ConcA , the number of ﬂ g22 - induced FLS2 - GFP endosomes increased more than twofold on average ( Figure 5 ; see Supplemental Figure 9 online ) . Colocali - zation studies with FM4 - 64 and FLS2 - GFP in the presence of ConcA revealed clustering of these endosomal compartments around small roundish structures ( see Supplemental Figure 8B online ) . Taken together , these data suggest that the ﬂ g22 - induced FLS2 endosomes mature into LE / MVBs , which likely target the activated FLS2 receptor for vacuolar degradation . Next , we focused on inhibitors known to interfere with RME . Tyrphostin A23 ( TyrA23 ) is a well - described inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis in protoplasts , roots , and leaves affecting the endocytosis of PIN proteins and cell surface receptors ( Ortiz - Zapater et al . , 2006 ; Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ; Konopka et al . , 2008 ; Kaiserli et al . , 2009 ) . Surprisingly , TyrA23 did not fully block ﬂ g22 - induced FLS2 - GFP endocytosis , but instead reduced FLS2 - GFP endosomal numbers to 60 % ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . Endosidin 1 ( ES1 ) was also reported to interfere with RME and to speci ﬁ cally inhibit endocytic traf ﬁ cking of BRI1 , PIN2 , and AUX1 but not PIN1 and PIN7 ( Robert et al . , 2008 ) . Similar to TyrA23 , ES1 treatments did not block internalization of FLS2 - GFP , but in contrast with TyrA23 did not affect endosomal numbers ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . However , we observed that ES1 application reduced the mobility of the FLS2 - GFP endosomes ( see Supplemental Figure 10A online ) . This is reminiscent of the reduced vesicle traf ﬁ cking by alterations of the cytoskeleton Figure 3 . Time Dependency of ﬂ g22 - Induced FLS2 - GFP Endocytosis Measured by Quantitative Imaging .

We therefore examined transgenic lines expressing GFP - ACTIN BINDING DOMAIN , which labels the actin cytoskeleton in the presence of ES1 . We detected strong bundling and evidence of depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton ( see Supplemental Figure 10A online ) . Consistent with our data , ES1 was recently identi ﬁ ed as an actin stabilizing molecule ( Tóth et al . , 2012 ) . We further addressed the role of the actin cytoskeleton on FLS2 endocytosis using the known actin cytoskeleton inhibitor Latrunculin B ( LatB ) ( Voigt et al . , 2005a ) , which exhibited only a minor impact on FLS2 - GFP internalization ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . This result is in contrast with previous ﬁ ndings ( Robatzek et al . , 2006 ) , and we therefore tested whether this effect could be due to the different tissues ( true leaves versus cotyledons ) and Figure 4 .

Nonetheless , no actin ﬁ laments were visible after a 1 - h incubation with LatB in both cotyledons and primary leaves , revealing no signi ﬁ cant differences between these tissues ( see Supplemental Figure 10B online ) . Although FLS2 was internalized in the presence of LatB , the FLS2 - GFP endosomes remained close to the plasma mem - brane and immobile as detected by high - resolution imaging ( see Supplemental Figure 10 online ) . A number of recent studies showed that the activity of myosins is involved in the dynamics of plasma membrane processes ( Konopka et al . , 2008 ; Sattarzadeh et al . , 2008 ) , which led us to investigate their role during interna - lization . Treatment with the general myosin inhibitor 2 , 3 - butanedione monoxime ( BDM ) ( Radford and White , 2011 ) reduced the number of ﬂ g22 - induced FLS2 - GFP endosomes by ; 80 % compared with the control . Thus , the BDM - mediated inhibition of the ac - tivity of myosins was suf ﬁ cient to block FLS2 internalization from the plasma membrane and provides evidence for myosin - dependent endocytic events ( Figure 5 ) . Traf ﬁ cking Inhibitors Differentially Alter FLS2 , ARA7 / Rab F2b , and ARA6 / Rab F1 Endosomes and Affect Their Overlap To further dissect the effects of chemical interference of mem - brane traf ﬁ cking and FLS2 endocytosis , we combined inhibitor treatments with colocalization of the ARA7 / Rab F2b and ARA6 / Rab F1 endosomal markers by quantitative imaging ( Figure 6 ) , which was supported by qualitative assessment of the images for possible alterations in endosome morphology ( see Supplemental Figure 5 .

FLS2 Endosomal Traf ﬁ cking 7 of 15 Figure 11 online ) . This approach provides a useful tool to differ - entiate between the effects of chemical inhibition on ligand - induced RME and steady state endosomal populations within the same cell . As for FLS2 - GFP transgenic plants , overall similar patterns of FLS2 - GFP endosomal numbers in response to in - hibitor treatments were obtained in the crossed dual marker lines that express FLS2 - GFP and RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b or FLS2 - GFP and ARA6 / Rab F1 - RFP ( Figure 6A ; see Supplemental Figure 11 online ) . In the presence of Wm , a decrease of ; 30 % in RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b and ARA6 / Rab F1 - RFP endosomal numbers was observed ( Figure 6A ) . This coincided with enlarged endosomal areas for FLS2 - GFP endosomes as well as RFP - ARA7 – and ARA6 - RFP – labeled endosomes ( Figure 6B ; see Supplemental Figure 11 online ) , which is in agreement with the described effects of Wm on the maturation of LE , and con ﬁ rms that both ARA7 / Rab F2b and ARA6 / Rab F1 can be found at LE compartments . This enlargement was neither found in BFA - nor ConcA - treated cells and shows the speci ﬁ c effect of Wm on the morphology of LE ( Figure 6B ) . For ConcA treatment , the distinct endosomal pop - ulations revealed differential effects . Although FLS2 - GFP num - bers were increased in both dual - color lines , ConcA did not affect the number of RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b endosomes , but it did cause a decrease in ARA6 / Rab F1 - RFP endosomal numbers ( Figure 6A ) . This could be attributed to a block of endosomal traf ﬁ cking from the TGN / EE to LE / MVB compartments ( Scheuring et al . , 2011 ) . While ﬂ g22 - induced FLS2 - GFP endosomes remained mostly unaffected by BFA treatment , we detected a decrease of ; 10 % of RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b endosomes following BFA treatment . By contrast , the number of ARA6 / Rab F1 - RFP endosomes was not affected in the presence of BFA . This suggests that a small but signi ﬁ cant proportion of the ARA7 / Rab F2b compartments comprise EE subject to endocytic recycling ( Figure 6A ) . In - terestingly , TyrA23 treatment caused a 30 % decrease in FLS2 - GFP endosomes , similar to that observed in RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b and ARA6 / Rab F1 - RFP endosomal numbers ( Figure 6A ) . This in - dicates that a signi ﬁ cant proportion of these compartments are generated via AP2 - dependent clathrin - mediated endocytic traf - ﬁ cking . When comparing the effect of TyrA23 on FLS2 - GFP in - ternalization between cotyledons and primary leaves , we did not detect any signi ﬁ cant difference ( see Supplemental Figure 12 online ) . Although we cannot generally exclude tissue - speci ﬁ c differences , these data suggest similar modes of action of che - mical inhibition in cotyledons used in our study compared with published data mostly obtained from root meristem and protoplast cells and to some extent from leaves ( Ortiz - Zapater et al . , 2006 ; Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ; Robert et al . , 2008 ; Drakakaki et al . , 2011 ) . Based on these quantitative data , we determined the degree of overlap between FLS2 - GFP and both RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b and ARA6 / Rab F1 - RFP endosomes . Wm treatment affected the overlap of FLS2 - GFP and RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b endosomal numbers , which was signi ﬁ cantly reduced to ; 55 % of coloc - alization , while the overlap between FLS2 - GFP and ARA6 / Rab F1 - RFP endosomal numbers remained unaltered ( Figure 7 ) . Although Wm treatment decreased the numbers of both ARA7 / Rab F2b and ARA6 / Rab F1 endosomal compartments to a similar extent , the reduction was signi ﬁ cantly higher for FLS2 - GFP endosomes , possibly re ﬂ ecting that FLS2 is internalized from the plasma membrane alongside a small proportion of RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b that localizes to EE . BFA and ConcA treatment did not alter the proportion of endosomal colocaliza - tion between FLS2 - GFP and both markers ( Figure 7 ) . As BFA treatment did not alter FLS2 - GFP endosomal numbers , the decrease in RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b compartments ( Figure 6A ) likely re ﬂ ects a different endosome population . In the case of ConcA treatment , despite contrasting ﬁ ndings of increased FLS2 - GFP endosomal numbers , unaltered RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b endosomal numbers , and decreased ARA6 / Rab F1 endosomal numbers , the overlap between these compartments was not signi ﬁ cantly affected ( Figure 7 ) . Treatment with TyrA23 leads to a small but signi ﬁ cantly reduced overlap between FLS2 - GFP and RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b and ARA6 / Rab F1 - RFP endosomes , respectively ( Figure 7 ) . This is in line with the detected reduction in endo - somal numbers of all three markers in the presence of TyrA23 . The Function of ARA7 / Rab F2b GTPase Is Required for ﬂ g22 - Induced FLS2 Endocytosis To investigate the signi ﬁ cance of activated FLS2 traf ﬁ cking via ARA7 / Rab F2b – positive compartments , we studied ﬂ g22 - induced endocytosis of FLS2 - GFP in the presence of dominant - negative ARA7 / Rab F2b ( RFP - DN - ARA7 / Rab F2b ) . Transient expression of RFP - DN - ARA7 / Rab F2b was previously shown to reduce endocytosis in root meristem cells and impairs PIN1 and BRI1 endocytic traf ﬁ cking ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2006 , 2008 ; Irani et al . , 2012 ) . For transient expression , we used particle bom - bardment of Arabidopsis leaves and ﬁ rst con ﬁ rmed that epidermal cells bombarded with soluble and endoplasmic reticulum – targeted monomeric RFP ( mRFP ) show normal plasma membrane lo - calization of FLS2 - GFP in the absence of ﬂ g22 and endocytosis of FLS2 - GFP in the presence of ﬂ g22 ( see Supplemental Figure 13 online ) . When transiently expressing RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b in FLS2 - GFP plants , we detected colocalization of ﬂ g22 - induced FLS2 - GFP endosomes with RFP - ARA7 / Rab F2b – positive com - partments ( see Supplemental Figure 13 online ) , as observed in our stable crossed lines ( Figure 2 ) . This demonstrates that en - docytic traf ﬁ cking of activated FLS2 is not generally in ﬂ uenced by bombardment - mediated transient expression , thus making this approach suitable to test for effects by DN - ARA7 / Rab F2b . Epi - dermal cells transiently expressing RFP - DN - ARA7 / Rab F2b were almost completely abolished in ﬂ g22 - induced FLS2 - GFP endo - cytosis ( Figure 8 ) . By contrast , neighboring nontransformed cells showed normal endocytosis of FLS2 - GFP upon ﬂ g22 trigger . These ﬁ ndings revealed that activated FLS2 requires a functional Rab5 GTPase pathway for its endosomal traf ﬁ cking . DISCUSSION In this study , we resolved the endocytic pathway of FLS2 in an activation - state and time - dependent manner . In its nonactivated state , FLS2 enters the endocytic route and constitutively cycles between the plasma membrane and EE compartments via the common endocytic pathway under the control of GNOM , being the ADP - ribosylation factor - guanine - nucleotide exchange factor target of BFA ( Geldner et al . , 2003 ) . Cycling via this common en - docytic route is known for a number of plasma membrane pro - teins , including the PIN proteins , to mediate patterns of subcellular 8 of 15 The Plant Cell localization ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ) , and for cell surface re - ceptors , such as BRI1 , BAK1 / SERK3 , SERK1 , and ACR4 , to regulate the abundance of receptors at the plasma membrane and maintain a constant pool of signaling receptors ( Russinova et al . , 2004 ; Reyes et al . , 2011 ) . The latter may be particularly relevant for BRI1 recognizing an endogenous ligand ( Geldner et al . , 2007 ) , while BAK1 / SERK3 endocytic recycling may allow the retrieval of this protein from the activated receptor complex to allow de novo interactions with other ligand binding receptors ( Russinova et al . , 2004 ; Geldner and Robatzek , 2008 ) . In the case of FLS2 , endocytic recycling occurs in the absence of both its ligand and its coreceptor BAK1 and is likely linked to the maintenance of steady state levels of FLS2 at the plasma membrane . When activated by ﬂ g22 , FLS2 enters the endocytic pathway and accumulates in bona ﬁ de endosomes , as revealed by FM4 - 64 tracing . BFA treatment does not alter FLS2 endo - some numbers , and ﬂ g22 - induced FLS2 endosomes appear not to be part of the BFA body , demonstrating that activated FLS2 is endocytosed via a GNOM - insensitive pathway . Therefore , our results indicate that endocytosis of the same cargo , FLS2 , can occur in both a GNOM - sensitive and - insensitive manner , depending on its activation status ( Figure 9 ) , which suggests differential regulation at the transition from a plasma membrane – resident receptor complex to endosomes . A similar observation of a regulatory switch between the re - cycling and degradation pathways of endocytosis was reported for the boron exporter BOR1 ( Takano et al . , 2005 , 2010 ) . Under steady state conditions and low boron concentrations , BOR1 localizes primarily to the plasma membrane with a small pro - portion undergoing constitutive endocytic recycling . In response to high boron , BOR1 is rapidly internalized and targeted for vac - uolar degradation and thereby prevents boron toxicity ( Takano et al . , 2005 ) . Also , although BRI1 is mainly subject to constitutive endocytic recycling , a proportion of endocytosed BRI1 is targeted Figure 6 .

FLS2 Endosomal Traf ﬁ cking 9 of 15 for vacuolar degradation ( Geldner et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , BOR1 and BRI1 subcellular traf ﬁ cking provided evidence that distinct modes of RME coexist in plants but the respective pathways remain to be de ﬁ ned ( Jürgens and Geldner , 2007 ) . To date , our understanding of RLK localization is based largely on qualitative information gained from interpretation and analysis of confocal image series . To measure quantitative dif - ferences in endosomal localization patterns over time , we de - veloped a robust and sensitive method for dissecting endocytic traf ﬁ cking by de ﬁ ned parameters . Determining the numbers and area of endomembrane compartments over time takes into consideration the transient nature of endosomes , exempli ﬁ ed by induced FLS2 endocytosis ( Robatzek et al . , 2006 ) . In combina - tion with chemical interference of membrane traf ﬁ cking and comparative analysis of known endosomal markers , this enables de ﬁ ned dissection of endocytic traf ﬁ cking . Previously , ARA7 / Rab F2b has been described to localize to EE / TGN as well as to LE / MVBs compartments ( Ebine et al . , 2011 ) , and while ARA7 / Rab F2b – and ARA6 / Rab F1 – positive endosomes mostly over - lapped ( Ueda et al . , 2004 ; Ebine et al . , 2011 ) , ARA6 / Rab F1 was more speci ﬁ cally associated with LE / MVBs ( Ueda et al . , 2004 ; Ebine et al . , 2011 ) . Both TyrA23 and Wm treatments reduced ARA6 / Rab F1 and ARA7 / Rab F2b endosomal numbers , while BFA treatment speci ﬁ cally reduced ARA7 / Rab F2b endosomal numbers . This observation is consistent with the notion that a proportion of ARA7 / Rab F2b – positive compartments are EEs that incorporate into BFA bodies , and another proportion mature into LE / MVBs , while ARA6 / Rab F1 more speci ﬁ cally localizes to LE / MVBs ( Ebine et al . , 2011 ) . These localization patterns sug - gest that these two Rab5 GTPases have partially redundant but distinct roles in endosomal traf ﬁ cking . Our quantitative imaging approach allows the dissection of such partially overlapping but otherwise distinct pathways in time and thus provides comprehensive insights into the dy - namics of the endosomal network . Applying this methodology to dissect the FLS2 traf ﬁ cking pathway , we determined that in - duced FLS2 endocytosis peaks at ; 60 to 75 min after induction , coincident with the maximal overlap of ARA7 / Rab F2b – positive endosomes . Maximal overlap with ARA6 / Rab F1 – positive en - dosomes occurred at ; 45 to 60 min and , in contrast with the sustained overlap between ARA7 / Rab F2b and FLS2 , decreased by 75 to 90 min of ﬂ g22 elicitation . The large overlap between ARA6 / Rab F1 and ARA7 / Rab F2b compartments and their transient behavior indicates that activated FLS2 is sequentially traf ﬁ cked from ARA7 / Rab F2b – positive compartments to endo - somes labeled by both Rab5 GTPases . Using transient expres - sion of DN - ARA7 / Rab F2b to genetically interfere with endocytic traf ﬁ cking con ﬁ rmed that this Rab5 GTPase pathway is required for endocytosis of activated FLS2 receptors , similar to ﬁ ndings with PIN1 and BRI1 ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2008 ; Irani et al . , 2012 ) . The signi ﬁ cant reduction in number and enlargement in area of ﬂ g22 - induced FLS2 endosomes upon Wm treatment shows that activated FLS2 is sorted and accumulates at LE / MVBs , in agreement with previous data ( Robatzek et al . , 2006 ) . It is currently thought that activated FLS2 is degraded in a ubiquitin - dependant Figure 7 .

A Functional Rab5 GTPase Pathway Is Required for FLS2 - GFP Endocytosis .

RFP signals in - dicate successful transiently transformed cells . Flg22 - induced FLS2 - GFP endosomes are detected in RFP - expressing cells but not when DN - ARA7 is present . However , neighboring cells show FLS2 - GFP endosomes . Arrowheads point at FLS2 - GFP endosomes . FLS2 - GFP is shown in green , RFP and RFP - DN - ARA7 / Rab F2b in red , and auto ﬂ uorescence from chloroplasts in blue . Similar results were obtained from eight transformed cells of at least two independent experiments . Bars = 10 µ m . 10 of 15 The Plant Cell manner by the PUB12 and PUB13 E3 ligases ( Göhre et al . , 2008 ; Lu et al . , 2011 ) , possibly in association with vacuolar degrada - tion ( Robatzek et al . , 2006 ; Geldner and Robatzek , 2008 ) . Our data show that ConcA treatments increase ﬂ g22 - induced FLS2 endosomes , forming clusters around small round structures , putatively of vacuolar nature . Genetic interference of PUB12 / 13 will be required to determine the mechanics of FLS2 degrada - tion with respect to FLS2 endocytic traf ﬁ cking . Chemical inhibition is often employed to dissect membrane traf ﬁ cking and is widely used in plant cell biology ( Geldner et al . , 2003 ; Robert et al . , 2008 ; Drakakaki et al . , 2009 ; von Kleist and Haucke , 2011 ) . ES1 was found to speci ﬁ cally trigger the ag - gregation of PIN2 , AUX1 , and BRI1 into SYP61 - and VHAa1 - positive endosomes ( Robert et al . , 2008 ) , but it did not alter FLS2 subcellular localization , as it does for PIN1 and PIN7 . We identi ﬁ ed that ES1 disrupts the actin cytoskeleton , which is a signi ﬁ cant observation and a likely explanation for the reduced motility of FLS2 endosomes observed following ES1 treatment . Likewise , our re ﬁ ned analysis now shows that the actin depo - lymerizing drug LatB does not inhibit internalization and instead impairs the motility of FLS2 - GFP endosomes . As a conse - quence , these immobile FLS2 - GFP endosomes remain in close proximity to the plasma membrane , which may have been overlooked in previous studies ( Robatzek et al . , 2006 ) . However , the internalization of FLS2 endosomes was arrested upon in - terference with the general activity of myosins by BDM treat - ment . This provides evidence that the actin - myosin system is critical for FLS2 endocytosis , whereby myosin functions in in - ternalizing endosomes and actin is required for intracellular traf ﬁ cking . The differential effect of BFA and ES1 on BRI1 and ﬂ g22 - induced FLS2 traf ﬁ cking , respectively , shows that endocytosis of both receptors is routed via distinct endosomal pathways . This raises an interesting issue in light of the observation that BAK1 / SERK3 forms a complex with BRI1 and FLS2 in a ligand - dependent manner ( Russinova et al . , 2004 ; Chinchilla et al . , 2007b ) . Differential regulation of RME is likely associated with sequence motifs present in the cytosolic domains of the cell surface receptors ( Geldner and Robatzek , 2008 ) . FLS2 lacks the conserved endocytic motif Yxx F , while this is present in most plant RLKs and receptor - like proteins . The role of the Yxx F motif in regulating RME in plants was revealed by mutational analysis inhibiting the function of the tomato ( Solanum lyco - persicum ) xylanase receptor LeEix2 ( Ron and Avni , 2004 ) and by TyrA23 - mediated inhibition of endocytic traf ﬁ cking of in planta expressed human transferrin receptor , hTfR ( Ortiz - Zapater et al . , 2006 ) . Although described as an inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and thus expected to fully block RME processes in plants ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) , TyrA23 treatment only partially impaired ﬂ g22 - induced FLS2 endocytosis . In plants , TyrA23 interferes with the recognition of the Yxx F residues , a motif involved in speci ﬁ c cargo recruitment to clathrin - coated vesicles and known to in - teract with m 2 adaptin in the AP2 complex ( Banbury et al . , 2003 ; Happel et al . , 2004 ; Chen et al . , 2011 ) . This speci ﬁ c Yxx F motif is absent from FLS2 ( Geldner and Robatzek , 2008 ) . Our data suggest that in general the uptake of 30 to 40 % of endocytic vesicles in the Arabidopsis cotyledon seem to depend on the m 2 adaptin - AP2 complex , and additional adaptins - AP2 complexes could be involved in mediating FLS2 endosome biogenesis . Alter - natively , we cannot exclude the possibility of endocytic pathways Figure 9 . Schematic Model of the FLS2 Endocytic Routes . Depending on its activation status , FLS2 enters two distinct endosomal pathways . The nonactivated receptor follows a recycling and BFA - sensitive endosomal pathway . FLS2 receptors activated by its ligand ﬂ g22 traf ﬁ c via a BFA - insensitive pathway and are sequentially transported via ARA7 / Rab F2b – and ARA6 / Rab F1 – positive and ConcA - and Wm - sensitive endosomes to the vacuole . [ See online article for color version of this ﬁ gure . ] FLS2 Endosomal Traf ﬁ cking 11 of 15 mediated by components other than clathrin ( Bandmann and Homann , 2012 ; Li et al . , 2012 ) . In summary , using quantitative imaging combined with subcellular markers and chemical in - hibition , we established seedling cotyledons as a suitable model for studying cell biological processes in plants . We identi ﬁ ed dynamic and transient FLS2 endosomal pathways that revealed distinct endocytic traf ﬁ cking routes of nonactivated and ligand - activated FLS2 receptors . These data provide a well - de ﬁ ned framework for future research to investigate the role of FLS2 endocytosis in ﬂ g22 - triggered responses .

Chemicals and Treatments All chemicals were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich , if not otherwise in - dicated , and used at the following concentrations : Wm ( 10 mM in DMSO , working solution 30 µ M ) , ES1 ( provided by N . Raikhel and G . Hicks , Riverside , CA ; 1 . 13 mM in DMSO , working solution 10 µ M ) , BFA ( 10 mM in ethanol , working solution 30 µ M ) , LatB ( 10 mM in ethanol , working solution 30 µ M ) , ConcA ( 10mMinDMSO , workingsolution10 µ M ) , TyrA23 ( 30mMin DMSO , working solution 100 µ M ) , BDM ( 500 mM in water , 50 mM working solution ) , FM4 - 64 ( Synapto RED , 5 mg / mL in water , working solution 1 : 2000 ) , and cycloheximide ( 50 mM , working solution 50 µ M ) . Detached cotyledons were vacuum in ﬁ ltrated for 2 min in inhibitor solutions , followed by 60 min incubation at room temperature . Flg22 or ﬂ g222 ( EZBiolab ; in water , working solution 10 µ M ) was added to the inhibitor solutions , and imaging was done at different time points after the addition of ﬂ g22 .

Bombardment sites were imaged 16 h after bombardment by confocal microscopy with or without ﬂ g22 treatment . For ﬂ g22 treatment , bombarded leaves were incubated for 40 to 50 min in 10 m M ﬂ g22 . For each treatment , data were collected from at least two independent bombardment events and several independent plants . Confocal Microscopy Standard confocal laser microscopy was performed using the laser point - scanningmicroscopeLeicaSP5 .

RFPwasexcitedat561 nm , and emission was taken between 580 and 620 nm . The sequential scan mode was used for simultaneously imaging of GFP / RFP . Images were pro - cessed using the LeicaLite and Adobe Photoshop CS4 software packages . High - throughput confocal imaging was performed using the spinning disc automated Opera microscope ( Perkin - Elmer Cellular Technologies ) as described ( Salomon et al . , 2010 ) . Excitation of the samples was performed at 488 nm for GFP and 561 nm for RFP ; the emission spectrum for GFP was captured using the 540 / 570 band - pass ﬁ lter , and RFP emission was detected using the 600 / 40 band - pass ﬁ lter . The exposure time was set to 120 ms . Leaves were prepared in 96 - well plates with optical glass bottoms ( Greiner ) . Images of a consecutive series of 21 planes with a distance of 1 m m were taken and displayed as a maximum projection using Acapella software ( Perkin - Elmer Cellular Technologies ) . Image Processing and Data Analysis Images taken by high content and high - throughput confocal microscopy were analyzed with the image processing software Acapella ( version 2 . 0 ; Perkin - Elmer ) . Based on an earlier developed algorithm referred to as the Endomembranescript ( Salomon etal . , 2010 ) , wedesignedanalgorithmto robustly detect and quantify spots in one channel ( GFP ) , which can subtract background auto ﬂ uorescence signals in the same channel ( EndomembraneQuanti ﬁ er ; see Supplemental Table 1 and Supplemental Data Set 1 online ) . In particular , spots were initially detected as described previously and then ﬁ ltered based on their roundness , intensity , area , length , and width . The remaining spots are categorized into two groups ( dark region and bright region ) using a dynamic mask function ( see ex - planation in Supplemental Figure 4 online ) . After that , the script calculates acontrastvaluebetweentheaverageintensityofaspotanditssurrounding area , based on which genuine spots from two regional groups are selected . Generally speaking , real spots in the bright - region group have considerably high contrast values , whereas real spots in the dark - region group have relatively low contrast . By combining the ﬁ nal results from two groups , we can separate genuine spots from noise and image artifacts effectively . Only spotspassing ourselectionareretained ( seeSupplementalFigure8online ) . Theprocedureproduces25output ﬁ elds , includingspotnumberperimage , valid image area on pseudo - projection images , Opera imaging time , av - erage intensity of the recognized spots , and total number of spots in a well ( see Supplemental Table 1 online for details ) . For the detection of endomembrane vesicles labeled with two different colors and their colocalization , we created a two - channel spots - overlapping detection algorithm ( EndomembraneCoLocQuanti ﬁ er ; see SupplementalTable2andSupplementalDataSet2online ) . Thisalgorithm consists of three parts : ﬁ ltering background auto ﬂ uorescence signals , selecting genuine spots from images in two channels ( GFP and RFP ) , and overlapping these spots and output . The overlap detection places spots detected in each channel on a maximum projection image . If in this image a channel - one spot boundary touches or fully contains one or more channel - two spot boundaries ( at least share two pixels $ 10 % of spot size ) , thespotisconsideredtobeoverlapping ( seedetailsinSupplementalFigure 5 online ) .
