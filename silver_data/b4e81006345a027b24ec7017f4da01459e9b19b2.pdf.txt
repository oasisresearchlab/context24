Evaluation of two - way protein ﬂuxes across the alveolo - capillary membrane by scintigraphy in rats : effect of lung inﬂation . J Appl Physiol 102 : 794 – 802 , 2007 . First published September 21 , 2006 ; doi : 10 . 1152 / japplphysiol . 00742 . 2006 . — Pulmonary microvascular and alveolar epithelial permeability were eval - uated in vivo by scintigraphic imaging during lung distension . A zone of alveolar ﬂooding was made by instilling a solution containing 99m Tc - albumin in a bronchus . Alveolar epithelial permeability was estimated from the rate at which this tracer left the lungs . Microvascular perme - ability was simultaneously estimated measuring the accumulation of 111 In - transferrin in lungs . Four levels of lung distension ( corresponding to 15 , 20 , 25 , and 30 cmH 2 O end - inspiratory airway pressure ) were studied during mechanical ventilation . Computed tomography scans showed that the zone of alveolar ﬂooding underwent the same distension as the contralateral lung during inﬂation with gas . Increasing lung tissue stretch by ventilation at high airway pressure immediately increased microvas - cular , but also alveolar epithelial , permeability to proteins . The same end - inspiratory pressure threshold ( between 20 and 25 cmH 2 O ) was observed for epithelial and endothelial permeability changes , which corresponded to a tidal volume between 13 . 7 (cid:1) 4 . 69 and 22 . 2 (cid:1) 2 . 12 ml / kg body wt . Whereas protein ﬂux from plasma to alveolar space ( 111 In - transferrin lung - to - heart ratio slope ) was constant over 120 min , the rate at which 99m Tc - albumin left air spaces decreased with time . This pattern can be explained by changes in alveolar permeability with time or by a compartment model including an intermediate interstitial space . intermittent positive pressure ventilation ; microvascular permeability ; blood - air barrier GAS IN ALVEOLAR SPACES is separated from blood by a thin membrane composed of epithelial and endothelial cell layers that are either closely juxtaposed or separated by a small interstitial space . Permeability to proteins of the epithelial and endothelial layers widely differs , alveolar epithelium being much less permeable than the endothelium ( 21 ) . The alveolo - capillary membrane may face physical , chemical , or biological insults , and the response of the epithelial or endothelial layers may differ depending on insult type ( 1 , 17 , 25 , 27 , 32 , 54 ) . For example , Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase on the alveolar side produces alveolar epithelium leakiness that manifests as an increase in the clearance of aerosolized albumin , without evidence of edema ( 1 ) , whereas chronic heart failure due to large cardiac infarcts increases protein ﬂuxes in both directions ( 11 ) . In vivo noninvasive measurement of protein ﬂuxes across the pulmonary microvascular barrier has been proposed to detect lung injury in experimental models ( 22 , 48 ) and in patients as well ( 2 ) . The ﬁrst attempt to estimate protein inﬂux in lungs used 113m In - transferrin as the tracer and a scintillation probe positioned over the thorax ( 22 ) . This measurement was subsequently improved by the use of other tracers and gamma camera or positron emission tomography imaging ( 45 ) . This latter method allows direct measurement of protein exchange rates , whereas simple scintigraphy imaging , which is of more widespread use , only provides ( through lung - to - heart ratios ) indexes that are proportional to protein ﬂuxes ( 41 ) . Alveolar permeability to proteins is affected by lung volume changes . Aerosolized albumin clearance was slightly ( by 50 % ) increased by applying 10 cmH 2 O positive end - expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) in sheep ( 37 , 38 ) . It is , however , unclear whether this increase was due to increased exchange surface area , maybe by the unfolding of alveolar cells ( 20 ) . Similar changes may also occur in humans since increasing functional residual capacity ( 29 , 33 ) increased alveolar permeability to a small aerosolized solute like 99m Tc - diethylenetriamine - pentaacetate ( 99m Tc - DTPA ) . Static , supraphysiological , but not milder lung inﬂation ( 16 , 28 ) increased alveolar epithelial permeability to proteins in liquid - ﬁlled lungs . Short periods of overinﬂation resulted in a reversible increase in pulmonary microvascular permeabil - ity to albumin and perhaps some increase in alveolar / airway epithelial permeability as radiolabeled albumin injected in the systemic circulation was recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid ( 14 ) . More sustained high tidal volume ( V T ) ventilation produced endothelial and epithelial cell alter - ations and a pulmonary edema of the permeability type ( 13 ) . The acute response to high - volume ventilation probably results more from biochemical events , such as the response to increased cellular calcium concentration because of the open - ing of stretch - activated cation channels ( 35 , 36 ) , than simple physical events . Higher lung stretch may result in cell mem - brane damage ( stress failure ) at the endothelial ( 19 ) or epithe - lial ( 51 ) level . Stretching alveolar epithelial cells in vitro resulted in membrane rearrangements ( 52 ) and increased the permeability to small molecules across alveolar cell monolay - ers ( 8 ) .

We locally instilled liquid in one lung and used two tracers , 99m Tc - albumin ( in the alveolar instillate ) and 111 In - transferrin ( in the blood ) to simultaneously evaluate alveolar epithelial and pul - monary microvascular permeability to proteins by a noninva - sive method , scintigraphic imaging , in vivo . Instillation in one lung only allowed us to compare changes in microvascular permeability between liquid - ﬁlled and air - ﬁlled lungs . We examined the response of the alveolar epithelial and endothe - lial cell layers with this method with respect to the level of lung distension and duration of mechanical ventilation . MATERIAL AND METHODS Animals . All experiments were conducted in compliance with the recommendations for laboratory animal research of the European Union and the French Ministry of Agriculture . G . Saumon is recipient of an authorization ( decree no . 2001 – 464 ; authorization no . 75 – 409 ; delivered June 28 , 2001 ) issued by the French Veterinary Services to perform experiments on anesthetized rodents . Male Wistar rats ( n (cid:2) 22 , 326 . 3 (cid:1) 13 . 31g , Elevage Janvier , Le Genest Saint Isle , France ) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg / kg pentobar - bital ( Sigma , St . Quentin Fallavier , France ) . They were tracheos - tomized , and a cannula ( Braun , Melsungen , Allemagne ) was tightly secured to the trachea to avoid gas leaks . Computed tomography scan . Computed tomography ( CT ) scans were obtained in six rats with a dedicated scanner ( Biospace , Paris , France ) to verify that the liquid instilled in a bronchus homogenously ﬁlled a well - limited zone in one lung . Brieﬂy , after airway instillation as described below , rats were ventilated with conventional ventilation [ CV , 8 ml / kg V T ; PEEP 2 cmH 2 O ; respiratory rate ( RR ) 70 breaths / min ; and fractional inspired O 2 ( F I O 2 ) of 1 ] for 30 min and killed with an overdose of pentobarbital . Several CT scan acquisitions were immediately performed in the vertical position increasing lung vol - ume by 0 , 6 , 14 , 23 , and 27 ml / kg that corresponded to airway pressures ( Paw ) of 0 , 12 . 2 (cid:1) 0 . 86 , 18 . 2 (cid:1) 0 . 87 , 25 . 0 (cid:1) 0 . 48 , and 31 . 5 (cid:1) 0 . 55 cmH 2 O . Airway pressure was measured with a piezo - electric transducer connected to the tracheal cannula ( AST , Vanves , France ) . Tissue density was evaluated on slices performed at same levels of the lungs using a 256 - level gray scale ( Scion Image ; http : / / www . scioncorp . com / pages / scion _ image _ windows . htm ) . Bone density was set to zero , and air density was set to 255 . Scintigraphic imaging . Continuous planar thoracic acquisitions were performed using a dedicated small animal gamma camera ( (cid:3) - Imager , Biospace , Paris ) equipped with a parallel collimator . Ac - quisition lasted 120 min without interruption . Acquisition windows were 140 keV (cid:1) 15 % for 99m Tc and 245 keV (cid:1) 20 % for 111 In ( 99m Tc does not emit in this energy window ) . Spillover of 111 In in the 99m Tc energy window ( (cid:4) 60 % 111 In counts in the 245 - keV window ) was subtracted , and 99m Tc activity decay was taken into account . 99m Tc / 111 In lung count ratio in the 99m Tc window was always (cid:4) 10 so that the correction always remained well below 10 % of 99m Tc counts . Dynamic series of images of 150 s each were computed from the registered scintigraphy data . Measurement of pulmonary microvascular permeability . About 400 (cid:5) Ci of 111 In chloride were injected in the dorsal penile vein . Transferrin ( 76 kDa ) strongly binds 111 In , and the 111 In - transferrin complex is a good tracer of passive protein movement because it does not bind to transferrin receptors ( 34 ) . A region of interest ( ROI ) was delineated on the cardiac cavities using the early images before any signiﬁcant 111 In - transferrin diffusion in the lungs . Radioactivity counts in the ROIs corresponding to the instilled and contralateral lung ( ROI E and ROI CL ) and to cardiac cavities were averaged per pixel . 111 In - transferrin accumulation in lungs relative to blood ( or plasma ) was estimated using the normalized lung - to - heart activity ratio ( 41 ) . This index ( lung - to - heart ratio divided by its initial value ) accurately reﬂects 111 In - transferrin plasma to lung ﬂux assuming that lung and heart blood volumes do not vary during the observation period . The slope of this 111 In - transferrin accumulation index was calculated by linear regression . Measurement of alveolar epithelial permeability . 99m Tc - labeled albumin ( 69 kDa ) was prepared using a commercial kit ( Vasculocis ; Cis Bio International , Gif sur Yvette , France ) . Paper chromatography using methanol as a solvent was performed to verify the amount of free 99m Tc ( 12 ) ; 99 . 7 (cid:1) 0 . 08 % 99m Tc was bound to albumin . The solution was instilled in one lung so that pulmonary microvascular permeability could be compared between the instilled and the nonin - stilled lung . We were unable to reproducibly produce a localized zone of alveolar “ﬂooding” during preliminary experiments using 500 (cid:5) l of an isotonic solution . A smaller volume might have not uniformly ﬁlled distal airspaces . We obtained better results with 250 (cid:5) l of a solution in which osmolarity was made about twice that of plasma by adding mannitol ( 120 mg / ml ) . This solution was supplemented with 600 (cid:5) Ci 99m Tc - albumin , bovine serum albumin ( 80 mg / ml ) , 1 mM amiloride ( an epithelial sodium channel inhibitor ) , and 1 mM phloridzin ( a sodium - glucose cotransport inhibitor ) to inhibit alveolar liquid ab - sorption ( 3 ) . It was slowly instilled in a distal airway after a short period of ventilation with F I O 2 (cid:2) 1 . A ROI was drawn over the thorax ( ROI T ) . Two other ROIs were drawn over the ﬂooded zone ( ROI E ) and the contralateral lung ( ROI CL ) . The surface enclosed in these two ROIs was slightly smaller than ROI T . Activity in each ROI was integrated over 150 - s steps and divided by initial total , i . e . , ROI T , activity . The decrease in 99m Tc - albumin activity in ROI T during ventilation with 25 or 30 cmH 2 O end - inspiratory plateau pressure ( Pplat ) fol - lowed a two - phase exponential decay . Pooled data were ﬁtted with a two - exponential decay equation ROI T activity (cid:1) A (cid:2) exp ( (cid:6) K 1 (cid:2) t ) (cid:3) (cid:7) M 0 (cid:4) A (cid:8) (cid:2) exp ( (cid:6) K 2 (cid:2) t ) ( 1 ) where M 0 is initial lung 99m Tc - albumin content . The same time course was also observed during severe oleic - acid pulmonary edema for aerosolized 99m Tc - albumin ( 37 ) , the presence of a fast compartment being explained by the presence of more damaged lung regions . However , this time course can also be due to an intermediate , interstitial compartment as shown in Fig . 1 . Indeed , interstitial space may play a signiﬁcant role in the clearance of alveolar solutes during lung injury ( 24 ) . Proteins are assumed to pass through a unique airway / alveolar membrane and enter the microcirculation directly or via the pulmonary interstitium . We will simply give the solution for this classic compartment system because it has been published many times ( see , for example , Ref . 40 ) . Let F A be the fraction of the tracer in the alveolar compartment and F I the fraction in the interstitial compartment , then , with the notation k ij (cid:2) k from compartment j to compartment i : Fig . 1 .

When t 3 0 , F I 3 0 , and then the initial slope of the curve ( albumin clearance rate from alveoli ) would be : (cid:4) Ka (cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:7) k IA (cid:3) k 0A (cid:8) ( 5 ) This initial slope was calculated by linear regression using the ﬁrst six data points ( ﬁrst 15 min ) after the beginning of high - pressure ventilation . The alveolar / airway epithelium permeability - surface area product ( PS A ) for 99m Tc - albumin is thus K a (cid:12) V A , where V A is the volume of the ﬂooded zone , (cid:4) 0 . 5 ml because we instilled 250 (cid:5) l of a (cid:12) 2 hypertonic solution . Ventilation modalities . Rats were paralyzed by injection of 15 mg / kg succinyl - choline ( Sigma ) and ventilated using a Harvard rodent volume ventilator ( Ealing , Courtaboeuf , France ) . Conventional ven - tilation was applied for 30 min , followed by different ventilation modalities for 120 min . Four end - inspiratory Pplat pressures were tested , 15 , 20 , 25 , and 30 cmH 2 O ( n (cid:2) 16 ) , corresponding to V T of 7 . 8 (cid:1) 0 . 31 , 13 . 7 (cid:1) 4 . 69 , 22 . 2 (cid:1) 2 . 12 , and 25 . 9 (cid:1) 1 . 76 ml / kg , respectively , in the absence of PEEP . RR was adjusted so that minute ventilation was about the same for all ventilation modalities . Wet - to - dry lung weight ratio . Lungs were removed from the thorax , weighed , and placed at (cid:6) 20°C for 1 mo to allow radioactivity to decay . They were then weighed one more time to verify the absence of loss , and dry weight was determined after 7 - day desiccation at 80°C . Statistical methods . All results are expressed as means (cid:1) SE . Comparisons were made by ANOVA using Bonferroni’s post hoc test or the Student’s t - test . Nonlinear regressions were made using Graph - Pad Prism ( San Diego , CA ) . Statistical signiﬁcance was accepted at P (cid:13) 0 . 05 . RESULTS CT scan imaging . CT scans ( Fig . 2 ) showed that the instil - lation protocol resulted in localized lung condensation contain - ing an air bronchogram . Instillation was performed four times in the left lung and two times in the right lung . Average surface areas were similar at functional residual capacity for lung slices taken at the same slice level . They were ( cm 2 ) for instilled left lungs 0 . 321 , 0 . 446 , 0 . 385 , and 0 . 352 ( average 0 . 376 ) , and for uninstilled left lungs 0 . 422 and 0 . 281 ( average 0 . 352 ) . For instilled right lungs , they were 0 . 356 and 0 . 305 ( average 0 . 331 ) , and for uninstilled right lungs 0 . 301 , 0 . 414 , 0 . 378 , and 0 . 319 ( average 0 . 353 ) . There was an exponential decrease in lung density ( inverse of grayscale ) in the zone of alveolar ﬂooding as lung volume increased ( Fig . 3 ) . Both lungs received about the same relative volume of gas , as differences in grayscale at low and high volume did not differ signiﬁcantly . End - inspiratory pressures ( Pplat ) and wet - to - dry lung weight ratio during ventilation . Figure 4 A shows Pplat values at 30 min ( t 30 ) and 120 min ( t 120 ) . Pplat did not vary signiﬁ - cantly during the test ventilation period when initial value was 15 or 20 cmH 2 O , whereas it increased signiﬁcantly from 25 to 32 . 5 (cid:1) 1 . 44 cmH 2 O ( P (cid:13) 0 . 05 ) and from 30 to 44 . 0 (cid:1) 1 . 68 cmH 2 O ( P (cid:13) 0 . 01 ) in the two other groups . Wet - to - dry lung weight ratios ( Fig . 4 B ) were (cid:4) 61 % ( ﬂooded lungs ) and 89 % ( air - ﬁlled lungs ) higher in rats ven - tilated with 30 cmH 2 O Pplat compared with those ventilated with 15 cmH 2 O Pplat ( P (cid:13) 0 . 01 and P (cid:13) 0 . 05 for instilled and contralateral lungs , respectively ) . There was no signiﬁcant difference between other wet - to - dry lung weight ratios . Scintigraphic imaging . Examples of images integrating the ﬁrst and last 15 min of an experiment are shown on Fig . 5 . Alveolar ﬂooding remained localized and stable during 120 min ( 99m Tc window ) with 15 cmH 2 O Pplat ( Fig . 5 A ) , and there Fig . 2 . Left to right : examples of computerized tomography ( CT ) scan slices performed at functional residual capacity ( FRC ) airway pressure ( Paw ) (cid:2) 0 , 12 , and 17 cmH 2 O , showing the recruitment of the zone of alveolar ﬂooding . Inﬂation volumes were 0 , 6 . 3 , and 15 . 6 ml / kg , respectively . Arrow shows air bronchogram . Analyzed slices were on the same plane positioned on the ribs . The heart moved with lung inﬂation and disappeared from the slice as acquisitions were performed in the vertical position because of the scanner design . 796 PROTEIN FLUXES ACROSS ALVEOLO - CAPILLARY BARRIER J Appl Physiol • VOL 102 • FEBRUARY 2007 • www . jap . org b y 10 . 220 . 32 . 247 on J u l y 11 , 2017 h tt p : / / j ap . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m was a slow 111 In - transferrin lung accumulation . By contrast , 30 - cmH 2 O Pplat ventilation induced a contralateral dispersion of the tracer and an increase in alveolo - capillary barrier per - meability as attested by the obvious decrease in overall 99m Tc - albumin activity over the thorax ( Fig . 5 B ) and the signiﬁcant lung 111 In - transferrin uptake ( Fig . 5 C ) . Lung 111 In - transferrin accumulation . 111 In - transferrin lung - to - heart activity ratio increased linearly during the test venti - lation period ( between t 30 and t 120 ) in all groups ( Fig . 6 ) . Slopes of 111 In - transferrin accumulation in lungs were thus calculated by linear regression . 111 In - transferrin accumulated in lungs slowly in rats ventilated with 15 and 20 cmH 2 O Pplat but much faster in rats ventilated with 25 and 30 cmH 2 O Pplat ( see Figs . 6 and 9 A ) . Accumulation slope increased , although nonsigniﬁcantly , with 25 - cmH 2 O Pplat ( 0 . 05 (cid:13) P (cid:13) 0 . 1 compared with 15 cmH 2 O Pplat ) and was signiﬁcantly higher in rats ventilated with 30 cmH 2 O Pplat ( P (cid:13) 0 . 001 ) . 111 In - transferrin accumulated at the same rate in the instilled and contralateral lung , whatever the Pplat ( Fig . 6 ) . 111 In - transferrin slopes correlated with lung wet - to - dry ratios in the instilled lung ( r 2 (cid:2) 0 . 68 , P (cid:13) 0 . 001 ) and contralateral lung as well ( r 2 (cid:2) 0 . 82 , P (cid:13) 0 . 001 ) . These slopes were averaged to provide a unique index of lung 111 In - transferrin accumulation because they did not signiﬁcantly differ . Alveolar 99m Tc - albumin permeability . Ventilation with 15 and 20 cmH 2 O Pplat did not induce 99m Tc - albumin dispersion in the lungs ( variation in ROI E and ROI CL activities ) or leakage from airspaces ( change in ROI T activity ) . These results are summarized in Fig . 7 . In contrast , ventilation with 25 and 30 cmH 2 O Pplat was associated with a dispersion of the tracer in the lungs that manifested as an increase in ROI CL activity . There was also a decrease in ROI T activity that reﬂected the leakage of 99m Tc - albumin from air spaces ( Fig . 7 , C and D ) . This leakage did not appreciably increase blood 99m Tc - albumin content , as no signiﬁcant activity was found over the liver ( data not shown , but this is obvious from Fig . 5 B ) . There was , however , no correlation between the amount of 99m Tc - albumin that redistributed in the contralateral lung and the leakage of this tracer from the lungs during the period of ventilation under test ( r 2 (cid:13) 0 . 01 , NS ) . The two - exponential decay curves adjusted over mean ( for better legibility ) ROI T values obtained during 25 and 30 cmH 2 O Pplat ventilations are shown in Fig . 8 . Mean K a values and albumin clearance rates calculated with individual data are given in Table 1 . Relationships between Pplat and 111 In - transferrin lung - to - heart ratio slopes or 99m Tc - albumin clearance were similar ( Fig . 9 A ) . There was a linear relationship between albumin PS product and 111 In - transferrin lung - to - heart ratio slope ( PS A (cid:2) 67 . 20 (cid:12) slope (cid:6) 0 . 06 , r 2 (cid:2) 0 . 87 , P (cid:13) 0 . 0001 ) . There thus was a strong correlation between these indexes of endothelial and epithelial permeability ( Fig . 9 B ) .

Ventilation with airway pressures above 25 cmH 2 O ( that corresponded to an increase in lung volume of 22 . 2 (cid:1) 2 . 12 ml / kg above FRC ) immediately increased pulmonary microvascular permeability , an observation we already made with much higher distending pressures ( 14 ) . This increase was accompanied by a simulta - neous , immediate increase in alveolar / airway epithelial perme - ability to proteins , which is a new observation . The presence of a threshold volume / pressure for micro - vascular permeability increase with lung tissue stretch has already been evoked ( 13 ) , but information on the in vivo acute response of the alveolar / airway epithelial barrier to stretch is lacking , even if in vitro experiments ( 8 , 51 ) suggest that stretch may similarly affect epithelial and endothelial layer permeability . The acute changes in alveo - lar / airway permeability appear to be biphasic , which may correspond to a decrease in permeability with time , or more probably , as will be discussed below , to the participation of an interstitial compartment . Roselli and Riddle ( 41 ) have shown that the many indexes that have been used to describe plasma to lung protein ﬂuxes using radioactive tracers and an external detection method were all related to a single one that they called the normalized slope index . This index is independent of the amount of tracer injected and of interstitial lung volume , tends to be indepen - dent of microvascular pressure , and increases with microvas - cular permeability . However , this normalized slope index re - quires an intravascular marker ( usually 99m Tc - erythrocytes ) together with the diffusible protein ( often 111 In - transferrin ) . This technique could not be used here as we used 99m Tc - albumin for our double - isotope imaging of protein ﬂuxes across the alveolo - capillary barrier . We then used the normal - ized lung - to - heart ratio slope of 111 In - transferrin that is related to the normalized slope index in the absence of lung and blood volume change ( 41 , 47 , 49 ) . We already showed that the 111 In - transferrin lung - to - heart ratio slope correlates well with protein accumulation rate in lungs during ventilator - induced lung injury ( 6 ) . The correlation found between this slope and the wet - to - dry ratio further conﬁrmed that it reﬂected perme - ability edema severity . We instilled a hypertonic solution ( about twice that of rat plasma ) so that a large part of the alveolar ﬂooding came from the circulation , as this occurs during actual pulmonary edema . Lung epithelium was not altered by this solution as the per - meability of the alveolar barrier to 99m Tc - labeled albumin remained low during the 30 min of conventional ventilation , in agreement with previous reports that hypertonic solutions were not injurious , either for epithelial or endothelial cells ( 7 , 9 ) . Hyperosmolarity may protect lung endothelial barrier proper - ties during various insults ( 42 ) after a transient increase in permeability because of cell shrinkage ( 39 ) . However , we found no difference between instilled and noninstilled lungs ( Fig . 6 ) , suggesting that the protective effect of hyperosmolar - ity was weak . Mannitol was used as the osmotic agent as it is not actively absorbed by epithelia , and sodium transport inhib - itors were added to the solution to decrease the rate of liquid absorption ( 43 ) , thus stabilizing the volume of the ﬂooded lung . Some studies have used the pulmonary clearance of aero - solized 99m Tc - albumin to study alveolar permeability to pro - teins ( see , for example , Refs . 26 , 50 ) . We choose to deliver the tracer as a bulk solution as this has been done for a long time to study alveolar epithelium protein transport ( 16 , 31 ) . Al - though it is possible that ﬁlling lungs with liquid may modify active and passive transport across the alveolar epithelial bar - rier ( 44 ) , many studies have used liquid ﬁlled lungs to study lung protein transport ( 23 ) . Further , bulk instillation may better reﬂect what occurs during pulmonary edema . CT scans showed that lung density varied in about the same proportion ( Fig . 3 ) in both lungs as they were inﬂated with air , which suggested that they underwent comparable distension during ventilation as their FRC were comparable . Liquid - ﬁlled lungs are theoret - ically more distensible than air - ﬁlled lungs because of the absence of an air - liquid interface . However , in lungs ventilated with air , the air - surfactant interface is replaced by places by an air - water interface with higher surface tension . It is therefore Fig . 5 .

C : 111 In energy window . There was a strong contralateral dispersion and an obvious leakage of 99m Tc - albumin from the lungs ( decrease in overall activity ) and an increase in lung 111 In - transferrin content . Note the absence of signiﬁcant 99m Tc activity over the liver region that suggests that circulating 99m Tc - albumin concentration was low and could not account for the activity in the contralateral lung ( B , right ) .

On the whole , the observation that 111 In - transferrin accumulation , and thus microvascular perme - ability alterations , were similar in the ﬂooded and contralateral lung suggests that tissue stress was similar in both lungs . The immediate increase in lung - to - heart ratio slope once high - volume ventilation was applied suggested that acute lung distension was responsible for this increase in permeability rather than cellular injury resulting from opening / reopening of distal lung units or the displacement of liquid in airways ( 5 ) . An increase in exchange surface area was also unlikely to explain this observation as there was no correlation between Fig . 6 . 111 In - transferrin lung - to - heart activ - ity ratios .

Prior studies found that increasing lung volume by 10 cmH 2 O PEEP slightly accelerated the clearance of aerosolized 99m Tc - albumin in normal lungs ( 37 ) . We also observed that distension produced an increase in 99m Tc - albumin clearance in normal , ﬂooded lungs . Clearance became biphasic , as this has been previously observed for aerosolized 99m Tc - DTPA , a small solute ( 37 ) with 10 cmH 2 O PEEP or during oleic - acid edema ( 25 ) , and for aerosolized 99m Tc - albumin , during severe oleic - acid edema ( 37 ) or surfactant inactivation ( 26 , 50 ) . The expla - nation put forward for the biphasic shape of 99m Tc DTPA clearance in the presence of 10 cmH 2 O PEEP was that the aerosol deposited in lung areas with different permeability - surface area products ( 38 ) , whereas , during pulmonary edema , 99m Tc - albumin clearance biphasic shape was thought to be due to the presence of lung regions with different levels of injury ( 37 ) . It may also be due during high volume ventilation to a decrease in alveolar permeability with time , but this seems unlikely as increasing duration of ventilation usually worsens lung injury ( 13 ) . It is worth noting that the biphasic shape was only seen when solute clearance was high , whatever solute size . Another simple explanation for these observations is that DTPA or albumin removal from the lungs by the circulation occurs both directly , probably through the thin part of the alveolo - capillary barrier , and via lung interstitium , with a possible signiﬁcant backﬂux from interstitium to alveolus when the tracer is not rapidly enough cleared from the inter - stitium . This backﬂux may increase with interstitium hydration during pulmonary edema development ( 46 ) .

The albumin clearance rate we observed during low and moderate Pplat ventilation ( 1 . 44 % / h , averaging 15 and 20 Pplat values ) was comparable to that previously reported using a similar model [ 1 . 6 % / h ( 4 ) ] . One of the main ﬁndings of our study is that there seems to be a threshold for Pplat or V T value above which alveolo - capillary membrane becomes permeable to proteins during mechanical ventilation , resulting in acute lung distension . This pressure is lower than that found during static lobe distension in the rabbit ( 15 ) . Interestingly , the threshold pressure value was about the same ( above 20 cmH 2 O ) for the epithelial and endothelial barrier . It is worth noting that this threshold ap - proximately corresponds to the pressure at which a decrease in the respiratory system pressure - volume curve slope ( the so called “upper inﬂection point” ) is observed in rats ( 30 ) . This decrease in compliance has been ascribed to the beginning of “hyperinﬂation” ( 10 ) . Thus ventilation above the upper inﬂec - tion point may rapidly increase epithelial permeability to pro - teins and decrease alveolar epithelium reﬂection coefﬁcient for all solutes , which may have a negative impact on alveolar liquid clearance in addition to producing a permeability type edema . Alveolar liquid clearance is important for the improve - ment of patients suffering from the acute respiratory distress syndrome ( 53 ) . These abnormalities may rapidly reverse if the challenge is not sustained long enough ( 14 , 18 ) . In conclusion , a simple double - isotope imaging technique can be used to noninvasively explore the simultaneous changes of lung microvascular and alveolar permeability to proteins in vivo . Lung distension during mechanical ventilation is associ - ated with an increase in alveolo - capillary barrier permeability to proteins that is characterized by epithelial and endothelial permeability alterations that occur at about the same threshold pressure value .
