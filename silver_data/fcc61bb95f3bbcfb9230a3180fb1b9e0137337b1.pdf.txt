The SH3 domain - containing protein Bemlp is needed for normal bud emergence and mating projection formation , two processes that require asym - metric reorganizations of the cortical cytoskeleton in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . To identify proteins that functionally and / or physically interact with Bemlp , we screened for mutations that display synthetic lethality with a mutant allele of the BEM1 gene and for genes whose products display two - hybrid interactions with the Beml protein . CDC24 , which is required for bud emergence and encodes a GEF ( guanine - nucleotide exchange factor ) for the essential Rho - type GTPase Cdc42p , was identified during both screens . The COOH - terminal 75 amino acids of Cdc24p , outside of the GEF domain , can interact with a portion of Bemlp that lacks both SH3 domains . Bacterially expressed Cdc24p and Bemlp bind to each other in vitro , indi - cating that no other yeast proteins are required for this interaction . The most frequently identified gene that arose from the beml synthetic - lethal screen was the bud - emergence gene BEM2 ( Bender and Pringle . 1991 . Mol . Cell Biol . 11 : 1295 - 1395 ) , which is allelic with IPL2 ( increase in ploidy ; Chan and Botstein , 1993 . Genetics . 135 : 677 - 691 ) . Here we show that Bem2p contains a GAP ( GTPase - activating protein ) domain for Rho - type GTPases , and that this portion of Bem2p can stimulate in vitro the GTPase activity of Rholp , a second essential yeast Rho - type GTPase . Cells deleted for BEM2 become large and multinucleate . These and other genetic , two - hybrid , biochemical , and pheno - typic data suggest that multiple Rho - type GTPases control the reorganization of the cortical cytoskeleton in yeast and that the functions of these GTPases are tightly coupled . Also , these findings raise the possibil - ity that Bemlp may regulate or be a target of action of one or more of these GTPases . B uo emergence in yeast requires the assembly of cytoskeletal elements at a discrete region of the plasma membrane soon after entry into the cell cycle . Early events in the formation of a bud site include the local - ization of a cluster of cortical actin " patches , " the assembly of the neck filaments , and the capture of microtubules at the presumptive bud site ( Kilmartin and Adams , 1984 ; Ford and Pringle , 1991 ; Kim et al . , 1991 ; Snyder et al . , 1991 ) . Genes that are required for the assembly of cortical cytoskeletal structures have been identified during searches for cell - division cycle ( cdc ) ~ mutants defective in bud emergence . At restrictive temperature , cells that carry Ts - mutations in CDC24 , CDC42 , or CDC43 fail to bud and become mul - tinucleate , large , and round , suggesting that these genes are required specifically for bud emergence but not for entry into J .

Abbreviations used in this paper : cdc , cell - division cycle ; DBD , DNA - binding domain ; AD , activation domain . the nuclear - division cycle or delocalized secretion ( Hartwell et al . , 1974 ; Sloat et al . , 1981 ; Adams et al . , 1990 ) . Cdc42p is a GTPase of the Rho family ( Johnson and Pringle , 1990 ) . The functions of Cdc24p and Cdc43p are tightly linked to that of Cdc42p : Cdc24p is a GEF for Cdc42p ( Zheng et al . , 1994 ) and Cdc43p is the / 3 subunit of a type I geranylgeranyl transferase that is required for the proper modification of the COOH terminus of Cdc42p and other GTPases ( Ohya et al . , 1993 ) . One general model for the role of Cdc42p in bud initiation is that it is directly , physically involved in the assembly of cytoskeletal structures . The observation that Cdc42p is found to be most concentrated at the presumptive bud site and re - mains at the tip of a bud during the early stages of bud growth ( Ziman et al . , 1993 ) is consistent with such a model . How - ever , this pattern of localization of Cdc42p is also consistent with a second general model in which Cdc42p functions in a signal - transduction cascade . Possible support for this sec - ond model comes from recent reports that some mammalian Rho - type GTPases , including one that is 80 % identical in se - quence to yeast Cdc42p , can bind to the protein kinases PAK and ACK ( Manser et al . , 1993 , 1994 ) . The kinase domain of PAK is 70 % identical in sequence to Ste20p ( Manser et © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 94 / 12 / 1395 / 12 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of CeU Biology , Volume 127 , Number 5 , December 1994 1395 - 1406 1395 al . , 1994 ) , a yeast protein that functions in the mating phe - romone response pathway ( Leberer et al . , 1992 ; Ramer and Davis , 1993 ) . The region of PAK that binds to human Cdc42p is similar in sequence to a portion of Ste20p ( Man - ser et al . , 1994 ) , raising the possibility that Cdc42p might act in one or more MAP kinase pathways whose targets of phosphorylation control cytoskeletal rearrangements . Clues to the mechanism by which Cdc42p controls the re - organization of the cortical cytoskeleton may come from the study of genes that interact with CDC24 and CDC42 . The MSB1 gene was previously identified as a multicopy sup - pressor of the Ts - phenotype of cdc24 and cdc42 mutants ( Bender and Pringle , 1989 ; D . Mack and A . Bender , unpub - lished data ) . Deletion of MSB1 has no obvious deleterious effects on cell viability or morphology . From a screen for mutations that display synthetic lethality with a deletion al - lele of MSB1 , BEM1 and BEM2 were identified ( Bender and Pringle , 1991 ) . BEM2 is allelic with IPL2 , a gene that was identified during a screen for Ts - mutants that display an increase - in - ploidy phenotype at restrictive temperature ( Chan and Botstein , 1993 ) . Cells that are defective in either BEM1 or BEM2 function become large and multinucleate ( Bender and Pringle , 1991 ; Chant et al . , 1991 ; Chenevert et al . , 1992 ; Chan and Botstein , 1993 ) . These phenotypes and the genetic interactions with MSB1 suggest that BEM1 and BEM2 are in - volved in bud emergence . Support for the view that BEM1 plays a role in bud initiation comes from the observations that Bemlp is localized to the bud site early in the cell cycle ( K . Corrado and J . Pringle , personal communication ) and that bend mutants can display a cdc bud - emergence arrest phenotype when the bud - site selection gene BUD5 is also defective ( Chant et al . , 1991 ) . Consistent with the view that Bemlp is involved in the control of cytoskeletal reorganiza - tions is the finding that bern1 mutants are defective for mating projection formation ( Chenevert et al . , 1992 , 1994 ) . Bemlp contains two copies of the SH3 domain , a pro - tein - protein interaction motif found in a variety of proteins associated with the cortical cytoskeleton ( Chenevert et al . , 1992 ) . To investigate the molecular functions of Bemlp , we have sought to identify proteins that interact with it by searching for mutations that display synthetic lethality with a mutant allele of BEM1 and for proteins that display two - hybrid interactions with the Beml protein . Materials and Methods Plasmids , Strains , and Media The plasmids and yeast strains used in this study are described in Tables I and II . Bacterial strain LU1 ( gift of D . Hagen , University of Oregon , Eu - gene , OR ) is a pyrF : : Tn5 derivative of SB69 ( Hagen and Sprague , 1984 ) . Bacterial strain TG1 , which contains laciq , is from the Amersham Corpo - ration ( Arlington Heights , IL ) . Plasmid pPB443 , which contains bem2 - AI : : URA3 , was constructed in multiple steps as follows . The 1 . 2 kb SmaI - NsiI fragment of DNA that ex - tends from , ' 00 . 9 kb upstream of the start codon of BEM2 to the NsiI site at codon 57 ( Figs . I and 2 ) was inserted into the PstI - SmaI sites of M13mpl8 - ( which contains an EcoRI and an SphI site in the polylinker ) to give phage B42 . The resulting 1 . 2 - kb EcoRI - SphI fragment of B42 was then inserted into the EcoRI - SphI sitesof plasmid pBR322 to give plasmid pPIM42 . The 2 . 7 - kb BglII - NheI fragment of BEM2 that extends from position 5549 ( within the BEM2 open - readiag frame ; Figs . 1 and 2 ) to the NheI site 3 ' of BEM2 ( see Fig . l ) was inserted into the BamHI - XbaI sites of M13mp18 to give phage B20 . The portion of the BEM2 gene 5 ' of that AccI site which is 19 bp downstream of the stop codon of BEM2 ( corresponding to position 6826 in Fig . 2 ) in B20 was removed , as follows , to give phage B50 . First , the SalI site in B20 was destroyed by filling it in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase . The segment of DNA between the Accl site in BEM2 and the Sinai site in the polylinker was then deleted by blunt - ended ligation after filling in the AccI overhang using Klenow fragment . Phage URA3 - M13 was constructed by inserting the 1 . 6 - kb SphI - SacI fragment from YIpURA3 ( S . Lillie , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan ) into the SphI - SacI sites of M13mpl8 . Finally , the 1 . 6 - kh SphI - SacI fragment of URA3 - M13 plus the SacI - SphI fragment of B50 were inserted together into the Sphl site of pPIM42 to give pPIM43 . In this plasmid , the portion of BEM2 between the NsiI site at codon 56 and the Accl site that is 20 bp downstream of the stop codon of BEM2 have been replaced by URA3 and DNA from between the HindIII and SphI sites of pBR322 . The media used in this study were YPD ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % peptone , and 2 % glucose ) ; SD ( 0 . 17 % yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate , 0 . 5 % ammonium sulfate , and 2 % glucose ) ; SC ( SD plus 20 / zg / ml uracil , 80 # g / mi L - leucine , 20 # g / ml adenine sulfate , 20 / zg / ml L - histidine , 20 # g / ml L - tryptophan , 20 # g / ml L - methionine , and 30 / ~ g / mi L - lysine ) ; SC - Leu ( SC without L - leucine ) ; SC - Ura ( SC without ura - cil ) ; SC - His ( SC without L - histidine ) ; SC - Trp ( SC without L - tryptophan ) ; SC - Trp - Leu ( SC without L - tryptophan and L - leucine ) ; and SC - Trp - Leu + X - gal ( SC - Trp - Leu with 2 % sucrose instead of glucose , plus 100 mM KH2PO4 buffered to pH 7 . 0 with KOH and 40 # g / ml X - gal from a 40 mg / ml stock in dimethylformamide ) . Screen for Mutants That Display Synthetic Lethality with bend Colonies of PY429 and PY431 cells were grown on SC - His plates to select for plasmid pPB403 ( ate3 mutants are phenotypically His - ) , resuspended and diluted in YPD , plated to give , , o2 , 000 cells per plate , and mutagenized to " o10 % survival using UV irradiation . Plates were incubated at 30°C for 5 d and then put at 4°C to allow the red color to develop . Thoroughly red colonies ( lacking white sectors ) were first streaked on YPD and incubated at 30°C to confirm that they displayed the Sect - phenotype and then streaked on YPD and incubated at 37°C to assay for Ts - growth defects . All PY429 - derived Ts - Sect - mutants were crossed individually with all PY431 - derived Ts - Sect - mutants by plating mixed cell suspensions on YPD medium and incubating for one day at 30°C . Mating mixes were streaked onto SD supplemented with adenine , leucine , and uracil to select for diploids . Cells from individual colonies of the resulting diploids were streaked on YPD and then checked for growth after 2 d at 37°C . Com - plementation tests with known mutants were done using strains Y132 and Y134 ( for cdc24 ) , DJTDI - 14B and DJTDI - 24C ( for cdc42 ) , JPTI98BD4 - 4A and CJ198 - 2B ( for cdc43 ) , and Y529 and Y565 ( for bern2 ) , selecting when possible for diploids on an appropriate selective minimal medium . Cloning and Localization of BEM2 The lithium - thiocyanate procedure ( Kcszenman - Foreyra and Hieda , 1988 ) was used to transform plasmids into bern , 2 strain Y454 . Transformants were selected on SC - Leu or SC - Ura medium at room temperature . Four in - dividual transformants for each plasmid were streaked on YPD and assayed for growth after 2 d at 36°C . The following colony - bybridization procedure was used to clone the re - mainder of the BEM2 gane . Colonies of bacteria carrying a YCp50 - based genomic library ( Rose et al . , 1987 ) were lifted onto Whatman 541 filter disks . The disks were allowed to dry at room temperature and then succes - sively transferred onto Whatman paper wetted with 0 . 5 M NaOH + 1 . 5 M NaC1 ( 10 min ) ; 0 . 5 M Tris , pH 7 . 5 ( 5 min ) ; 0 . 5 M Tris , pH 7 . 5 ( 5 min ) ; and 2x SSC ( Maniatis et al . , 1982 ; 5 min ) . The disks were immersed in 95 % EtOH and shaken for 10 min and then immersed in fresh 95 % EtOH and shaken for an additional 10 min . Disks were allowed to dry at room temperature and then baked at 80°C for 2 h . They were then incubated in the following hybridization solution overnight at 65°C : 5x SSC , 2x Dan - hardt ' s reagent ( Maniatis et al . , 1982 ) , 50 mM NaPO4 ( pH 6 . 5 ) , 200 # g / ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA , and 0 . 1 % SDS . a - 32pdATP was incorpo - rated into a DNA probe by primer extension with Klenow fragment ( Mania - tis et al . , 1982 ) , using a segment of BEM2 in M13 as the template . The probe was denatured by incubation at 100°C for 15 min and then incubated with the disks in hybridization solution overnight at 65°C . Disks were washed in 2x SSC + 0 . 1 % SDS for 6 h at room temperature , with four changes of the wash solution . The positions of the colonies on the filters were determined by staining with 0 . 25 % methyl green dye , and the colonies that contained DNA that hybridized to the probe were identified by autora - diography .

Approxi - mately 25 , 000 transformants were screened for the development of blue color . 12 blue colonies were streaked onto SC - Trp - Leu + X - gal medium . In - dividual blue colonies from these streaks were inoculated into SC - Trp - Leu medium , and plasmids were recovered from yeast using a glass - beads pro - cedure ( Strathern and Higgins , 1991 ) . Escherichia coli strain LU1 , which contains a mutant allele of leuB , was transformed with plasmids from yeast and plated onto LB + Amp medium . Amp r transformants were replica - plated onto selective medium lacking leucine to identify Leu + transfor - mants . For / 3 - galactosidase activity assays in liquid culture , overnight cultures of yeast were diluted 10 - to 40 - fold in the appropriate synthetic liquid medium ( SC - Leu , SC - Trp , or SC - Trp - Leu ) and then grown for 8 - 9 h with shaking at 30°C . Cultures were harvested at an OD600 of 0 . 1 to 0 . 5 . / 3 - galactosidase assays were performed as previously described ( Reynolds and Lundblad , 1989 ) . Biochemical A nalyses The purification of GST - Rholp ( using the baculovirus expression system in Sf9 cells ) and GST - Bem2p ( from bacteria ) and the GTPase activity assay were performed as described previously ( Zheng et al . , 1994 ) . E . coli strain LU1 containing plasmid pGEX - KG ( Guan and Dixon , 1991 ) or pPB734 ( for expression of GST or GST - Cdc24p , respectively ) and strain TG1 containing plasmid pPB - / 13 ( for expression of 6xHis - Bemlp ) were grown at 30°C in LB + 100 # M ampicillin to an OD600 of 0 . 7 - 0 . 9 . ( The 6xHis - Bemlp fusion was used simply as a source of Bemlp ; the 6xHis tag itself was not used for these experiments . ) Expression of fusion proteins was induced with IPTG ( 0 . 2 - 1 mM ) , and growth at 30°C was continued for 3 - 5 h . Cells were harvested and resuspended in a volume of ice - cold sonica - tion buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HC1 pH 8 , 300 mM NaC1 , 5 mM fl - mercapto - ethanol , 100 mM PMSF , 400 ng / ml bestatin , 500 ng / ml leupeptin , 350 ng / ml pepstatin A ) that was 10 % of the volume of the original culture . Lyso - zyme was added to 1 mg / ml , and the mixtures were incubated on ice for 30 min . After sonication , the lysate was centrifuged at 17 , 000 g for 20 min at 4°C . The supernatants , to which was added Triton X - 100 ( 1 % final con - centration ) , were used for the binding studies ( see below ) . Glutathione - agarose resin ( Sigma Chem . Co . , St . Louis , MO ) was pre - pared according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . Aliquots of the resin were equilibrated in binding buffer ( sonication buffer containing 1 % Triton X - 100 ) and then incubated with rocking for 30 min at 4°C with extracts con - taining either GST or GST - Cdc24p . The resin was washed extensively with binding buffer and then incubated with the 6xHis - Bemlp - containing extract for 2 h at 4°C . After extensive washing with binding buffer , the samples were boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer and then subjected to SDS - PAGE analysis ( Laemmli , 1970 ) . Results Screen for Mutations That Display Synthetic - Lethal Interactions with bern1 Cells that lack Bemlp function appear to have an incom - pletely penetrant bud emergence defect at 30°C ; some of the cells display normal morphologies while others become large and multinucleate or lyse ( Bender and Pringle , 1991 ; Chenevert et al . , 1992 ) . Although a fair fraction of individ - ual beml cells display morphological defects and have poor viability even at such " permissive " temperatures , cultures of beml cells can be propagated at temperatures up to " o38°C . To identify genes that interact with BEM1 , we screened for mutants that require a wild - type copy of BEM1 for survival at 30°C . The general strategy used to find such mutants was to screen through clones of beml cells for mutants that were unable to survive the loss of a plasmid containing wild - type BEM1 . To identify such mutants , we used an ADE3 / ade2 ade3 - based colony - sectoring assay ( Bender and Pringle , 1991 ) . In this scheme , the BEM1 plasmid contains the ADE3 color marker and the beml strain carries mutant alleles of ADE2 and ADE3 . Cells that contain the plasmid are red ; The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 127 , 1994 1398 cells that have lost it are white . On rich medium , the starting strain forms red colonies that contain white sectors ( Sect + phenotype ) . However , mutants that become dependent upon Bemlp function for survival are predicted to form thoroughly red colonies that lack white sectors ( Sect - phenotype ) . To facilitate complementation analyses , bend synthetic - lethal mutants were sought from both a and ot strains ( PY429 and PY431 ) . 365 Sect - mutants were identified from PY429 and 315 Sect - mutants were identified from PY431 . All of the first 164 diploids analyzed from crosses involving 34 PY429 - derived Sect - mutants and 13 PY431 - derived Sect - mutants were Sect - , suggesting that it may not be possible to organize the mutants into complementation groups using the Sect phenotype . However , we found that those Sect - mutants that were also Ts - for viability could be organized into complementation groups based upon their Ts - pheno - type . We therefore restricted our analysis to those Sect - mutants that either failed to grow or grew only poorly at 37°C . 34 Ts - Sect - mutants , at least 14 of which were in - dependently derived , were isolated from strain PY429 , and 29 Ts - Sect - mutants , at least 14 of which were indepen - dently derived , were isolated from strain PY431 . Because substantial mutagenesis ( to 10 % survival ) was used in the generation of these mutants , we expected that the Ts - growth defects in many of them may be functionally un - related to the mutations responsible for the Sect - pheno - type ( i . e . , they may be fortuitous Ts - mutations ) . We there - fore chose to analyze only those Ts - Sect - mutants that arose more than once from the screen . Each of the PY429 - derived mutants was therefore crossed to each of the PY431 - derived mutants , and the resulting diploids were tested for Ts - growth defects . 15 of the diploids failed to grow at 37°C . These mutants fell into four complementation groups ( Table III ) . To determine whether any of these complementation groups contained mutations in genes known to be involved in bud emergence , every member of each group was crossed to Ts - cdc24 , cdc42 , cdc43 , and bem2 mutant strains , and the resulting diploids were assayed for growth at 37°C ( see Materials and Methods ) . Although all of the mutants com - plemented both the cdc42 and cdc43 mutants , the two mem - bers of group I failed to complement the Ts - growth defect caused by cdc24 , and all eight members of group II failed to complement the Ts - phenotype of bem2 mutants . When transformed with a low copy number plasmid containing CDC24 , both of the group I mutants could grow at 37°C , consistent with the view that these strains indeed are defec - tive in CDC24 function . In addition , these transformants now displayed a Sect + phenotype at 30°C , confirming that cdc24 is indeed synthetically lethal with beml . Analogous Table IlL Ts - Sect - Mutants Identified from a beml Synthetic - Lethal Screen Complementation No . of independent group isolates Gene I 2 CDC24 II 7 - 8 * BEM2 III 3 ? IV 2 ? * The range indicates the uncertainty as to how many isolates were actually in - dependently derived . results with group II mutants transformed with a low copy number plasmid carrying BEM2 confirmed that these mu - tants are defective in BEM2 function and that bem2 and beml display a synthetic - lethal interaction . The analyses of the mutants in groups III and IV will be presented elsewhere . Subcloning of BEM2 A plasmid containing a fragment of DNA from the BEM2 locus was previously isolated by complementation of the Ts - phenotype of a genomic bem2 mutation ( Bender and Pringle , 1991 ) . To localize BEM2 within this clone , various segments of the insert were tested for the ability to comple - ment the Ts - phenotype of a bem2 mutant ( Fig . 1 ) . The results of the subcloning analysis suggested that BEM2 ex - tends across the left - hand BgllI site , but that in appropriate contexts ( e . g . , plasmids pPB318 and pPB467 ) , sequences to the left of that BglII site are sufficient for suppression ( Fig . 1 ) . By sequence analysis , a single large open - reading frame was identified that crossed that BglII site and extended be - yond the right end of the original insert ( Fig . 1 ) . This open - reading frame was found to be in frame with an ATG in the tetracycline - resistance gene of the vector , starting 64 codons upstream of the BamHI site into which the insert was origi - nally cloned ( data not shown ) . Colony hybridization was used to isolate a plasmid containing the remainder of BEM2 ( see Materials and Methods ) . The sequence of BEM2 ( Fig . 2 ) is identical to that oflPL2 ( Kim et al . , 1994 ) . The BEM2 open - reading frame is predicted to encode a protein of 2 , 167 amino acids ( 245 kD ) .

Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of BEM2 . The Rho - GAP domain is boxed . The following restriction sites ( see Fig . 1 ) are overlined : EcoRV ( 1 ) , NsiI ( 472 ) , Sau3A ( 1684 ) , BglII ( 4347 ) , SphI ( 4953 ) , SpeI ( 5481 ) , BglII ( 5549 ) , BanI ( 6201 ) , AccI ( 6826 ) , and HindIII ( 6994 ) . These sequence data are available from EMBL / GenBank / DDBJ under accession number L33832 . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 127 , 1994 1400 for the suppression of the Ts - phenotype of bem2 mutants ( Figs . 1 , 2 , and 3 ) . Because BEM2 appears to be involved in bud emergence ( Bender and Pringle , 1991 ; Chan and Bot - stein , 1993 ) , and BEM2 was identified genetically through its interaction with MSB1 , itself a multicopy suppressor of Ts - mutations in CDC42 , it initially seemed likely that Bem2p would prove to be a GAP for Cdc42p . To investigate this possibility , a Rho - GAP domain - containing portion of Bem2p was previously expressed and purified as a GST fu - sion protein from bacteria and assayed for GAP activity upon a GST - Cdc42p fusion purified from a baculovirus expression system . Although the Rho - GAP domain - containing protein Bem3p can stimulate the GTPase activity of Cdc42p in this assay , the GST - Bem2p fusion was not able to serve as a GAP for Cdc42p ( Zheng et al . , 1993 , 1994 ) . Rholp is the only other known essential Rho - type GTPase in yeast . Strong overexpression of RH01 causes cells to be - come large and multinucleate ( Madaule et al . , 1994 ) , im - plicating Rholp as a potential target of Bem2p . To test this possibility , the GST - Bem2p fusion ( Fig . 4 a ) was assayed for GAP activity toward a GST - Rholp fusion ( Fig . 4 a ) from Sf9 cells . As shown in Fig . 4 b , Bem2p can stimulate the rate of release of nla from [ ~ - nP ] GTP , but not from [ a - nP ] GTP , bound to Rholp , indicating that Bem2p can indeed stimulate the hydrolysis of GTP on Rholp in vitro .

Bar , 10 # m . segregants grew poorly at 24°C and were completely invia - ble at temperatures above 32°C . Even at temperatures per - missive for colony formation , many bem2 - AI : : URA3 cells became large and multinucleate ( data not shown ) , as was seen previously for the original , presumed point - mutant al - leles of bem2 ( Bender and Pringle , 1991 ) . When grown at 36°C , the majority of bem2 - AI : : URA3 cells display these phenotypes ( Fig . 5 ) . These results are consistent with the view that BEM2 plays some role in bud - site assembly and / or bud growth . Physical Interaction between Bemlp and Cdc24p To search for proteins that display two - hybrid interactions with Bemlp , plasmid pPB550 , which encodes a fusion be - tween the DBD ( DNA - binding domain ) of lexA and nearly full - length Bemlp ( see Materials and Methods ) , was trans - formed into yeast strain CTY10 - 5d , which contains the lacZ reporter gene under the control of the lexA DNA - binding site . This DBD - Bemlp - bearing strain was then transformed with a plasmid library that contains random Sau3A frag - ments of genomic DNA fused to the coding sequence for the AD ( transcriptional activation domain ) of Gal4p ( Chien et al . , 1991 ) . Of ' ~ 50 , 000 transformants obtained , 12 expressed / 3 - galactosidase activity as detected by X - gal plate assays . The library plasmids from these 12 transformants were iso - lated and individually retransformed into CTY10 - 5d con - taining either no other plasmid or pPB550 . In all cases , ~ - galactosidase expression was dependent upon the presence of both the library plasmid and the DBD - Bemlp fusion . To investigate whether Bemlp itself was required for these in - ductions of / 3 - galactosidase expression , each library plasmid was introduced into a strain that contains pCTC52 , a plasmid that encodes a fusion between the DBD of lexA and human nuclear lamin C , a protein unrelated to Bemlp . All ofthese transformants were white on X - gal medium , suggesting that the products of these library clones might interact specifi - cally with DBD - Bemlp . Based upon restriction analysis , at least seven of the clones from the library were judged to contain DNA from a single genomic region ( data not shown ) . DNA sequence analysis indicated that at least six of these clones had non - overlap - ping , short ( 2 to 38 codons ) open - reading frames in frame with the AD . This result indicates that the gene responsible for the induction of / ~ - gal expression in this set of clones need not be fused to the AD . These clones were not analyzed further . Based upon DNA sequence and restriction analyses , it was determined that one of the remaining library clones contains CDC24 fused in - frame at its third codon to the AD ( data not shown ) . Quantitative / ~ - gal activity assays confirmed that the induction of / 3 - gal expression required the presence of both the DBD - Bemlp - and the AD - Cdc24p - encoding plasmids ( Fig . 6 , combinations 1 - 3 ) .

Two - hybrid interaction between Bemlp and Cdc24p . The portions of Bemlp fused to the DBD ( DNA - binding domain ) of LexA and the portions of Cdc24p fused to the AD ( activation do - main ) of Gal4p are represented by boxes . ~ galactosidase activities are given for the average values from three independent transfor - mants for each combination of plasmids used . The range of activi - ties for each set of measurements was always less than 60 % of the average . The following combinations of plasmids were used : pPB550 ( 1 ) , pPB553 ( 2 ) , pPB550 + pPB553 ( 3 ) , pPB594 ( 4 ) , pPB594 + pPB553 ( 5 ) , pPB623 ( 6 ) , pPB623 + pPB553 ( 7 ) , pPB689 ( 8 ) , and pPB623 + pPB689 ( 9 ) . both SH3 domains can display a two - hybrid interaction with Cdc24p ( Fig . 6 , combinations 6 and 7 ) , indicating that the SH3 domains are not required for this interaction . Con - versely , a segment of Bemlp that contains both SH3 domains but lacks its COOH terminus fails to interact with Cdc24p ( Fig . 6 , combinations 4 and 5 ) . A segment of the COOH ter - minus of Cdc24p that lacks both the GEF domain and a puta - tive PH ( Pleckstrin homology ) domain , a motif found in various proteins implicated in signal transduction ( Musac - chit et al . , 1993 ) , can display a two - hybrid interaction with Bemlp ( Fig . 6 , combinations 8 and 9 ) . This is the same por - tion of Cdc24p that has recently been shown to be lethal Figure 7 . In vitro binding studies using bacterially ex - pressed Bemlp and Cdc24p fusion proteins .

Sakaguchi , Y . Ohya , and Y . Anraku , personal communication ) . To investigate whether Bemlp binds directly to Cdc24p , the ability of bacterially expressed Bemlp to bind to a bac - terially expressed GST - Cdc24p fusion was tested ( Materials and Methods ) . As shown in Fig . 7 , Bemlp can indeed bind to GST - Cdc24p , but not to GST alone , indicating that the in - teraction between Bemlp and Cdc24p is direct and that no other yeast proteins are required for this interaction . The analyses of the remaining clones that were identified from the two - hybrid screen will be presented elsewhere . Discussion Interaction between Bemlp and Cdc24p Given that Bemlp and Cdc24p are both involved in bud emergence , and that beml displays synthetic lethality with cdc24 , the physical interaction between Cdc24p and Bemlp identified in this study almost certainly reflects a biologically relevant association . One model for the role of this interac - tion is that Bemlp acts to physically link Cdc24p to some " landmark " protein that marks the site at which a bud or a mating projection is supposed to form . In this scenario , Bemlp might serve simply as an adaptor between the puta - tive landmark protein and Cdc24p , or Bemlp might both link Cdc24p to the landmark protein and stimulate its GEF ( or other ) activity there . A second model is that Bemlp is a com - ponent of a complex of proteins that becomes assembled at the bud or mating projection site in response to the action of Cdc24p and / or Cdc42p . For example , Cdc24p may play a role in positioning Bemlp at the bud site , and Bemlp might in turn help to nucleate the assembly of cytoskeletal struc - tures there . A third model is that the primary role of Bemlp is to regulate the GTPase cycle of Cdc42p and perhaps other Rho - type GTPases ( see below ) . We are currently investigat - ing whether Bemlp affects the ability of Cdc24p to stimulate GTP - GDP exchange on Cdc42p in vitro . Although there are insufficient data to distinguish among specific models for the role of Bemlp , it seems likely , based upon the following immunolocalization and genetic data , that Bemlp acts at the bud site and plays an early role in bud emergence . In particular , Bemlp has recently been shown to be localized to the bud site early during the process of bud site assembly ( Kathy Corrado and John Pringle , personal communication ) , and BEM1 has been found to display a synthetic - lethal interaction with mutant alleles of the bud site selection gene BUD5 ( Chant et al . , 1991 ; Fig . 8 ) . Mutations in BUD5 can both lower the restrictive temperature ( from 39 to 37°C ) and confer a cdc arrest phenotype to beml mutants ( Chant et al . , 1991 ) . These genetic interactions between bud5 and beml might reflect a direct physical association be - tween the two gene products and so support the idea that Bemlp serves as a linker between the bud site selection ma - chinery and Cdc24p . However , for the following reasons , these genetic interactions between bud5 and bern1 are also consistent with the possibility that Cdc24p links the bud - site selection machinery to Bemlp , a situation in which Bud5p need not physically interact with Bemlp . Bud5p has recently been shown to behave genetically as a GEF for Rsrlp ( Bender , 1993 ; Fig . 8 ) , a Ras - type GTPase that is required for proper bud - site selection ( Bender and Pringle , 1989 ; Chant and Peterson et al . Interactions between Bemlp , Bem2p , and Rho GTPases 1403 Rsrl ( Cdc42 Beml Rhol ( ) Cdc2 I i ) B e m 2 , , ) GTP Cdc42 GTP . Msbl Rhol Figure 8 . Genetic and two - hybrid interactions among proteins im - plicated in cell polarity development . Double - headed arrows indi - cate synthetic - lethal interactions ; straight , single - headed arrows represent multicopy suppression ; and the straight , thick line indi - cates a physical interaction . Herskowitz , 1991 ) . RSR / was itself identified as a multicopy suppressor of Ts - mutations in CDC24 ( Bender and Prin - gle , 1989 ; Fig . 8 ) , raising the possibility that Rsrlp binds to Cdc24p . Thus , if the activated form of Rsrlp binds to Cdc24p ( Ruggieri et al . , 1992 ) , then mutations in BUD5 that prevent the activation of Rsrlp may interfere with the normal func - tioning of Cdc24p , a situation that could be lethal in the ab - sence of functional Bemlp ( given that cdc24 and beml dis - play synthetic - lethal interactions ; Fig . 8 ) . Consistent with this possibility is the observation that BUD5 is required for wild - type RSR / , but not for mutationally activated rsrl ~ " 2 , to serve as a multicopy suppressor of cdc24 ( Bender , 1993 ) . Interaction between BEM1 and BEM2 From preliminary studies using sucrose velocity gradient sedimentation and gel filtration , it appears that Bemlp may be part of a complex that is ~ 80 S in size ( L . Bender and A . Bender , unpublished data ) . It is possible that a number of genes whose products are either constituents of this com - plex or are required for the proper functioning of those constituents would display genetic interactions with BEM1 . Because of difficulty in organizing potential bern1 synthetic - lethal mutants into complementation groups using the Sect phenotype , we limited our analyses to those bend synthetic - lethal mutants that were also Ts - for viability . BEM2 was one of four such genes that were identified at least twice each during this screen . The synthetic - lethal interaction between beml and bern2 suggests that the functions of Bemlp and Bem2p may be closely linked , an idea that is supported by the following genetic and phenotypic data . In addition to displaying synthetic lethality with each other , beml and bem2 both display synthetic lethality with msbl ( Bender and Pringle , 1991 : Fig . 8 ) . These interactions with msbl seem particularly significant given that deletion of MSB1 in an otherwise wild - type strain does not have any obvious deleterious effect , and beml and bem2 are the only mutants known to display synthetic lethality with msbl at temperatures lower than 37°C ( Bender and Pringle , 1991 ; D . Fouts and A . Bender , unpublished data ) . Msblp is not simi - lar in sequence to other known proteins . The most distin - guishing feature of the Msblp sequence is that it is rich in prolines ; over a stretch of 300 amino acids near its COOH terminus , 16 % of the amino acids are prolines . Given that proline - rich sequences in some proteins have been found to bind to SH3 domains , it is possible that Msblp binds to one or both of the SH3 domains of Bemlp . Unlike CDC24 and CDC42 ( Coleman et al . , 1986 ; John - son and Pringle , 1990 ) , BEM1 ( Chenevert et al . , 1992 ) and BEM2 are not essential for viability , beml and bern2 mutants also have in common a lack of penetrance of their mutant phenotypes : some of the cells in a culture of beml or bem2 mutants grown even at permissive temperatures can be large and multinucleate , whereas the rest appear normal ( Bender and Pringle , 1991 ) . The following evidence is consistent with the view that both beml and bem2 mutants also have a ten - dency to become aneuploid and / or polyploid . First , BEM2 ( as IPL2 ) has recently been identified during a screen for mu - tations that cause cells to become polyploid ( Kim et al . , 1994 ) . Second , colonies of MATa bern1 or bem2 mutant cells often produce abnormally low amounts of a - factor phero - mone and in some cases instead produce a - factor , a situation that could result from instability of the MATa locus - con - taining chromosome ( A . Bender , unpublished data ) . Third , crosses involving either beml or bern2 mutants frequently give only inviable segregants ( A . Bender , unpublished data ) , consistent with the possibility that triploids or aneuploids are being formed in these crosses . Multiple Rho - type GTPases and Bud Emergence Its inferred amino acid sequence suggested that Bem2p would prove to be a GAP for one or more Rho - type GTPases . For the following reasons , Rholp was considered to be a possible target of the presumed GAP activity of Bem2p . Strong over - expression of RH01 can cause cells to become large and multinucleate ( Madaule et al . , 1994 ) , suggesting that the presence of too much Rholp can interfere with bud emer - gence . Expression of a constitutively activated allele of RHO1 also causes cells to become large , round , and unbud - ded ( Madaule et al . , 1994 ) . Since the phenotypes caused by an activating mutation in RH01 would be expected to resem - ble those caused by a loss of function of the GAP for Rholp , and mutations in BEM2 apparently cause defects in bud emergence , we considered the possibility that Bern2p might act as a GAP for Rholp . We found that the Rho - GAP domain of Bem2p can indeed stimulate the GTPase activity of Rholp in vitro . Because the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rholp is very low , we were not able to accurately calculate the amount of stimu - lation by Bem2p of the Rholp GTPase activity . However , given that the apparent rate of Bem2p - stimulated GTPase activity of Rholp appears to be low ( e . g . , it is approximately fourfold lower than the measured rate of the Bem3p - stim - ulated GTPase activity of Cdc42p Zheng et al . , 1994 ) , it appears that Bem2p has only weak GAP activity toward Rholp in vitro . It is possible that the GST - Bem2p fusion used in these assays lacks sequences and / or modifications that are necessary for full activity and that the GAP activity of Bem2p toward Rholp in vivo is therefore higher than the GAP activity measured in vitro . However , it is also possible that the observed in vitro GAP activity of Bem2p approxi - mates its in vivo activity and that this level of GAP activity The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 127 , 1994 1404 is sufficient for Bem2p to serve as an effective down - regulator of Rholp . Given its role in bud emergence , Cdc42p was considered to be another potential target of Bem2p . However , we have been unable to detect any GAP activity of Bern2p toward Cdc42p ( Zheng et al . , 1994 ) . The ability of the Rho - GAP domain of Bem3p to serve as a GAP for GST - Cdc42p indi - cates that the GST - Cdc42p fusion used in those experiments was functional . The finding that the GST - Bem2p fusion is ac - tive as a GAP toward Rholp demonstrates that the GST - Bem2p fusion used in those assays also was functional . Com - bined , these results argue strongly that Bem2p does not act as a GAP toward Cdc42p . Furthermore , the finding that GST - Bem2p will not competively interfere with the ability of Bem3p to serve as a GAP toward Cdc42p suggests that Bem2p cannot even bind to Cdc42p ( Zheng et al . , 1993 , 1994 ) . The other known Rho - type GTPases in S . cerevisiae are Rho2p , Rho3p , and Rho4p ( Madaule et al . , 1987 ; Mat - sui and Toh - e , 1992a ) . Depletion experiments suggest that Rho3p and Rho4p may be involved in bud growth ( Matsui and Toh - e , 1992b ) , raising the possibility that one or both of these GTPases may be targets of Bem2p . Efforts to test whether Bem2p can act as a GAP for Rho3p in vitro have been frustrated by our inability to purify a functional GST - Rho3p fusion ( Y . Matsui , Y . Zheng , and R . Cerione , unpub - lished data ) . In principle , genetic data could help identify the relevant in vivo targets of Bern2p . However , if the functions of multiple Rho - type GTPases are interconnected , such data may be difficult to interpret . Interactions between Bemlp and Multiple Rho - type GTPases BEM1 is able to serve as a multicopy suppressor of the lethal - ity caused by depletion of both Rho3p and Rho4p ( Matsui and Toh - e , 1992b ) . When combined with the genetic data linking Bemlp with Bem2p and the two - hybrid , biochemical , and genetic data linking Bemlp with Cdc24p , the finding that BEM1 is a multicopy suppressor of rho3 rho4 double mu - tants raises the possibility that Bemlp is a common target of action for , or regulator of , multiple Rho - type GTPases . Al - ternatively , it is possible that the main role of Bemlp involves its interaction with Cdc24p and that the genetic interactions between BEM1 and other Rho - type GTPases reflect a tight coupling of function between Cdc42p ( a target of Cdc24p ) and other Rho - type GTPases . Consistent with the latter view is the finding that CDC42 itself can also serve as a multi - copy suppressor of rho3 rho4 mutants ( Matsui and Toh - E , 1992b ) . Loss of Rholp function , either by depletion ( Madaule et al . , 1994 ) or by using a Ts - allele ( Yamochi et al . , 1994 ) , causes cells to arrest with small buds , suggesting that Rholp plays a role in bud development . Rholp appears to be con - centrated at sites of cortical actin patches , supporting the view that Rholp may play a role in the control of actin organi - zation ( Yamochi et al . , 1994 ) . The view that multiple Rho - type GTPases control cytoskeletal reorganizations in prepa - ration for bud emergence in yeast parallels findings that multiple Rho - type GTPases control the reorganization of the cortical cytoskeleton in fibroblasts in response to growth fac - tors ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ; Ridley et al . , 1992 ) . In ver - tebrates as in yeast , there appear to be functional interac - tions between Ras - and Rho - type GTPases and between Rho - type GTPases and SH3 domain - containing proteins ( Settleman et al . , 1992 ; Birge and Hanafusa , 1993 ; Musac - chio et al . , 1993 ) . Future studies in yeast and animals may reveal whether there exist evolutionarily conserved func - tional relationships among these and other sets of proteins and protein motifs involved in cellular morphogenesis and signal transduction .
