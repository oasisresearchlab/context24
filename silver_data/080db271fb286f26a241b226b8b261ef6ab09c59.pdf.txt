The mechanics of cryptic crossword clues are briefly explained , and 29 the process is set into the insight literature , with parallels being drawn between several different 30 types of cryptic crossword clues and other insight - triggering problems such as magic , jokes , 31 anagrams , rebus and remote association puzzles ( RAT ) , as well as ‘classic’ thematic or spatial 32 challenges . We have evidence from a previous survey of cryptic crossword solvers that the ‘Aha ! ’ 33 moment is the most important driver of continued participation in this hobby , suggesting that the 34 positive emotional ‘payback’ has an energizing effect on a participant’s motivation to continue 35 solving . 36 37 Given the success with which a good quality cryptic crossword elicits ‘Aha ! ’ moments , cryptics 38 should prove highly valuable in exploring insight under lab conditions . We argue that the crossword 39 paradigm overcomes many of the issues which beset other insight problems : for example , solution 40 rates of cryptic crossword clues are high ; new material can easily be commissioned , leading to a 41 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 2 limitless pool of test items ; and each puzzle contains clues resembling a wide variety of insight 42 problem types , permitting a comparison of heterogeneous solving mechanisms within the same 43 medium . Uniquely among insight problems , considerations of expertise also come into play , allowing 44 us to explore how crossword solving experts handle the deliberate misdirection of the cryptic clue 45 more effectively than non - expert , but equally experienced , peers . 46 47 Many have debated whether there is such a thing as an ‘insight problem’ per se : typically , problems 48 can be solved with or without insight , depending on the context . We argue that the same is true for 49 cryptic crosswords , and that the key to the successful triggering of insight may lie in both the 50 difficulty of the challenge and the degree to which misdirection has been used . Future research is 51 outlined which explores the specific mechanisms of clue difficulty . This opens the way to an 52 exploration of potential links between solving constraints and the experiencing of the ‘Aha ! ’ 53 moment , which may shed light on the cognitive processes involved in insight solution . 54 55 Introduction : insight and ‘insight problems ’ 56 The feeling of insight - a sudden , euphoric ‘cognitive snap’ ( Weisberg , 2015 ) signaling a 57 breakthrough in the solution of a problem - is well - known to most of us . In terms of its 58 phenomenological experience , four key elements of the insight , or ‘Aha ! ’ moment have been 59 identified : first , the suddenness and unexpectedness of the resolution , which arrives unheralded by 60 conscious awareness of the solution path or ‘feelings of warmth’ at the approaching dénouement ; 61 secondly that - however difficult it had proved before ( perhaps involving a state of impasse ) - the 62 problem can be rapidly processed once the solution has been identified ; thirdly that there is a 63 strong , typically positive , emotional response at the point of resolution ; and finally that the solver is 64 fully convinced that the correct solution has been identified ( Topolinski & Reber , 2010a ; see also 65 Metcalfe , 1986 ; Davidson , 1995 ; Gick & Lockhart , 1995 ; Danek , Fraps , Von Müller , Grothe , & 66 Öllinger , 2014b , 2014a ; Kounios & Beeman , 2014 ; Shen , Yuan , Liu , & Luo , 2015 ; on negative insight 67 ( ' Uh - oh ' ) see also Hill & Kemp , 2016 ) . The phenomenological experience of the Aha ! moment is thus 68 complex , with at least four contributory components : suddenness , surprise , happiness and certainty 69 ( Gick & Lockhart , 1995 ; Danek , et al . , 2014a ; Danek , Wiley , & Öllinger , 2016 ) . 70 71 One of the key problems in studying insight is the unpredictability of this moment in everyday life . 72 Although ‘everyday insight moments’ can be experienced ( such as the sudden realization of where a 73 bunch of keys has been left ) , the sudden and fleeting nature of this moment has led most studies to 74 attempt to elicit responses artificially under laboratory conditions , using a bank of so - called ‘insight 75 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 3 problems’ intended to trigger the identical phenomenological response ( Hill & Kemp , 2016 ) . 76 Nonetheless , even this approach is not without issues , primarily centered upon the difficulty of 77 finding an effective , convenient and reliable insight - triggering task for the participant to solve . 78 79 Current obstacles in exploring insight in the laboratory 80 Lab studies of insight in problem solving have met with a number of obstacles , which have been well 81 rehearsed in the literature . These include the historic paucity of standardized problem material 82 ( MacGregor & Cunningham , 2008 ; Batchelder & Alexander , 2012 ; Danek , et al . , 2014b ) ; the difficulty 83 and complexity of the tasks , leading to low solution rates and low numbers of problem trials within 84 the practical limitations of investigative time - frames ( Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003b ; MacGregor & 85 Cunningham , 2008 ; Batchelder & Alexander , 2012 ; Danek , et al . , 2016 ) ; and the memory advantage 86 obtained for solutions arrived at by insight ( Dominowski & Buyer , 2000 ; Danek , Fraps , von Müller , 87 Grothe , & Öllinger , 2013 ) which rules out test - retest options ( MacGregor & Cunningham , 2008 ) . 88 89 This last issue poses a particular problem for controlled , lab - based research , given that the solutions 90 to so many of the classic riddle - style ‘insight problems’ ( e . g . the 9 - dot problem , the reversed triangle 91 of coins , the broken necklace challenge - Cunningham , MacGregor , Gibb , & Haar , 2009 - see figure 1 ) 92 are now freely available on - line and in puzzle collections ; this commonly leads to the need to discard 93 trials due to familiarity with the puzzles ( Öllinger , Jones , & Knoblich , 2014 ; see also Danek , et al . , 94 2016 ) . 95 96 < Insert figure 1 somewhere here > 97 98 Following attempts to increase the pool of test material in recent years , larger collections of 99 calibrated problems do now exist ( Chu & MacGregor , 2011 ) : these have moved away from the 100 classic ‘riddle - style’ puzzles ( Webb , Little , & Cropper , 2016 ) and might include matchstick arithmetic 101 problems ( Knoblich , Ohlsson , Haider , & Rhenius , 1999 ) , compound remote association problems 102 ( ’CRA’ - a variation of ‘Remote Association Test’ ( RAT ) problems - Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003b ) , 103 the ‘Car Park Game’ ( Jones , 2003 ) , rebus puzzles ( MacGregor & Cunningham , 2008 ) , Bongard 104 problems and ‘tricky series completion’ problems ( Batchelder & Alexander , 2012 ) . Recently , magic 105 tricks have been added to the list of available paradigms ( Danek , et al . , 2014b ) . 106 107 When is insight ‘insight’ ? 108 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 4 The use of a canonical set of ‘insight problems’ to explore Aha ! moments in the laboratory has led to 109 a long - standing debate concerning the underlying cognitive mechanisms involved in their solution : 110 specifically , whether an Aha ! feeling is the result of ‘special’ thought processes , or is merely an 111 epiphenomenon arising from cognitive processes which are ‘business as usual’ ( for a review of this 112 debate see Davidson , 1995 ; Bowden , Jung - Beeman , Fleck , & Kounios , 2005 ; Ohlsson , 2011 ; Gilhooly , 113 Ball , & Macchi , 2015 ; Weisberg , 2015 ) . One confounding issue which has hampered investigation of 114 this question is the common assumption in many historical studies that ‘insight problems’ are , per 115 se , always solved with insight by every successful solver ; in other words , that ‘triggering insight’ is an 116 inherent and objective property of the ‘insight problem’ which unfailingly comes into play ( Bowden 117 & Jung - Beeman , 2007 ; Ohlsson , 2011 ; Öllinger , et al . , 2014 ) . Crucially , as a result of this a priori 118 assumption , no check was typically made as to whether the ‘Aha ! ’ moment had actually been 119 experienced in these trials , leading to a highly problematic circularity : “Insight problems are 120 problems that require insight , and insight occurs when insight problems are solved” ( Öllinger & 121 Knoblich , 2009 , p . 277 ; see also Danek , et al . , 2016 ; Webb , et al . , 2016 ) . An early attempt ( Weisberg , 122 2015 ; see Ash , Cushen , & Wiley , 2009 ) to circumvent this problem by categorizing ‘insight problems’ 123 into ‘pure’ problems ( those that could only be solved with insight ) , ‘hybrid’ problems ( those that 124 could be solved through insight and other methods ) and ‘non - insight’ problems ( those which are 125 always resolved through an analytical approach ) nonetheless still requires that a subset of problems 126 exists which infallibly trigger insight . 127 128 A critical flaw in this approach is that it overlooks the interactive nature of problem solving : 129 successful solving arises from the interplay of problem and person , with each individual bringing an 130 unique blend of knowledge , experience and cognitive approaches to bear upon it ( Ash , et al . , 2009 ; 131 Ohlsson , 2011 ) . It is therefore entirely possible for a so - called ‘insight puzzle’ to be solved through 132 controlled , deliberate , systematic and evaluative means by some solvers - analytic ‘Type 2’ thinking 133 according to dual process theory ( Evans & Stanovich , 2013 ; Sowden , Pringle , & Gabora , 2015 ; 134 Weisberg , 2015 ) - which is not thought to give rise to a characteristically strong emotional response , 135 other than satisfaction at the job completed ( Kounios & Beeman , 2014 ) . 136 137 Others , however , may solve the same puzzle with a flash of inspiration that they could not predict , 138 through processes operating below the threshold of their awareness , and will experience the impact 139 of the Aha ! moment . Much will depend on what each solver brings to the solving process : “each 140 problem can be solved without insight if the initial problem representation is adequate and the 141 appropriate heuristics are available” ( Öllinger , et al . , 2014 p . 267 ) , and this will vary from solver to 142 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 5 solver according to their skill - set and experience . The presence or absence of insight thus resides in 143 the solver’s approach to solving the puzzle , not simply in the problem itself ( Bowden & Jung - 144 Beeman , 2007 ; Cunningham , et al . , 2009 ; Webb , et al . , 2016 ) , and the categorization of ‘insight 145 problem’ stimuli as ‘pure’ or ‘hybrid’ , or ‘insight / non - insight’ on the grounds of a hypothetical 146 cognitive task analysis appears to be fundamentally flawed ( Ash , et al . , 2009 ; Webb , et al . , 2016 ) . 147 148 The purpose of insight research should not therefore be to develop a single theory which accounts 149 for all solutions to ‘insight problems’ arrived at by any manner under experimental conditions 150 ( Ohlsson , 2011 ) , but to isolate those solutions which have evoked the phenomenological events 151 specifically characteristic of an Aha ! event , and to use these to explore the cognitive mechanisms 152 underlying this experience ( Webb , et al . , 2016 ) . More contemporary studies have typically achieved 153 this by collecting subjective feedback from trial participants as to whether they have actually 154 experienced an ‘Aha ! ’ moment at the point of solution ( Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2007 ; Kounios , et 155 al . , 2008 ; Cranford & Moss , 2011 ; Jarosz , Colflesh , & Wiley , 2012 ; Danek , et al . , 2014b ; Salvi , 156 Costantini , Bricolo , Perugini , & Beeman , 2016 ; Webb , et al . , 2016 ) . This technique has been validated 157 by a number of neuroimaging studies , which have empirically demonstrated meaningful differences 158 between problems identified by participants as being solved with insight , or in a step - wise fashion 159 ( Zhao , et al . , 2013 ; Kounios & Beeman , 2014 ) . 160 161 Representational Change Theory 162 Notwithstanding this , it would be unhelpful to reject the term ‘insight problem’ altogether , given 163 that it is clear that some cognitive puzzles are more likely to trigger insight moments than others 164 ( Danek , et al . , 2014a ) , and indeed ‘insight problems’ may operate along a continuum of efficacy 165 ( Webb , et al . , 2016 ) . In particular , Representational Change Theory ( ’RCT’ - Ohlsson , Ernst , & Rees , 166 1992 ; Knoblich , et al . , 1999 ; Ohlsson , 2011 ; Öllinger , et al . , 2014 ) suggests that especially effective 167 insight - triggering puzzles use the solver’s prior knowledge and expectations to deliberately induce a 168 false conceptualization of the problem ( Ovington , Saliba , & Goldring , 2016 ) , leading to self - imposed 169 constraints which impede a solution . This can result in a feeling of ‘impasse’ : the situation where the 170 solver feels that they have explored all possible approaches to resolving the problem , and is now at a 171 loss as to what to try next ( Knoblich , Ohlsson , & Raney , 2001 ) . 172 173 The moment of insight is argued to be the point at which the hindering constraint is suddenly 174 removed , leading to a relaxation of the impasse and the rapid redefining of the problem space , 175 followed by a swift solution . The initially incorrect reading of the problem - termed ’ mental set ’ by 176 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 6 the Gestalt school ( Wiley , 1998 ; Öllinger , Jones , & Knoblich , 2008 ) - is argued to arise unavoidably 177 and unconsciously from implicit assumptions or well - practiced procedures which are activated 178 highly automatically ( Ohlsson , et al . , 1992 ; Knoblich , et al . , 1999 ; DeYoung , Flanders , & Peterson , 179 2008 ; Öllinger , et al . , 2008 ; Danek , et al . , 2014b ; Patrick , Ahmed , Smy , Seeby , & Sambrooks , 2015 ) , 180 making the less obvious , but correct , interpretation of the problem very unlikely to come to mind . It 181 is the dropping of the incorrect assumptions , and disengagement from the outdated hypothesis , 182 which is argued to allow progress to be made . 183 184 Heterogeneous Nature of Insight Puzzles and their Mechanisms 185 It is thus widely acknowledged that ‘insight problem’ solving involves some form of reconstructive 186 change of the initial representation of the problem ( Chronicle , MacGregor , & Ormerod , 2004 ; 187 Cunningham , et al . , 2009 ; Danek , et al . , 2014a ) ; however , the precise mechanisms to achieve this 188 reconstruction - and whether they are in any way ‘special’ - remain unclear . 189 190 A number of theoretical models to explain this restructuring in classic insight puzzles , such as the 9 - 191 dot or the 8 - coin puzzles , have been put forward : for example ‘elaboration , re - encoding or 192 constraint relaxation’ ( Ohlsson , et al . , 1992 ) ; ‘opportunistic assimilation’ ( Seifert , Meyer , Davidson , 193 Patalano , & Yaniv , 1995 ) ; ‘constraint relaxation and chunk decomposition’ ( Knoblich , et al . , 1999 ) ; 194 ‘solution - recoding’ ( Chronicle , et al . , 2004 ) ; see further the reviews by Ash , Cushen , & Wiley ( 2009 ) 195 and Batchelder & Alexander ( 2012 ) . Nonetheless , since the formulation of these theories , a wider 196 range of insight - triggering paradigms has been developed which on at least superficial grounds differ 197 greatly in their appearance and the demands they make upon the solver ( Bowden , et al . , 2005 ) . It is 198 therefore at least possible that the cognitive processes leading up to the moment of restructuring 199 differ according to the specific puzzle parameters at play ( Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2007 ) , making a 200 single - process theory of restructuring difficult ( Cunningham , et al . , 2009 ) . 201 202 In a study comparing the relationships among a small range of diverse insight puzzles ( classic ‘spatial’ 203 puzzles , RAT puzzles and rebus problems ) , Cunningham and colleagues identified the following 204 characteristics of restructuring which they believed were displayed , to a greater or lesser extent , by 205 each of their puzzle formats of interest ( Cunningham , et al . , 2009 ) . As predicted by RCT , some 206 puzzles involved the need to overcome misdirection or the relaxation of automatically elicited 207 constraints concerning the existing components of the puzzle or its spatial layout ( Cunningham , et 208 al . , 2009 ) . However , in others , the primary difficulty appeared to lie in identifying what the eventual 209 solution would look like , perhaps requiring the assimilation of extra incidental information , a sudden 210 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 7 ‘figure - ground’ reversal of perspective , or additional steps in order to hit upon the solution 211 ( Cunningham , et al . , 2009 ) . 212 213 One methodological issue thus lies in how ‘well - defined’ a problem type is ( DeYoung , et al . , 2008 ; 214 see also Simon , 1973 ; Pretz , Naples , & Sternberg , 2003 ; Davidson , 2003 ; Hélie & Sun , 2010 ; Danek , 215 et al . , 2016 ; Ovington , et al . , 2016 ; Webb , et al . , 2016 ) . An ill - defined problem has no clear 216 representation of the problem space in terms of key features such as the initial conceptualization of 217 the challenge , the final goal state , and the mechanizable steps which need to be taken to achieve 218 this goal . By contrast , ‘well - defined’ problems may be tackled by controlled and systematic 219 paradigmatic processes leading to steady progress towards a known target state ( Smith , 2003 ; 220 DeYoung , et al . , 2008 ) , and better defined problems of this kind therefore lead less often to solution 221 through insight ( Webb , et al . , 2016 ) . 222 223 Despite early attempts to categorize insight puzzles ( e . g . as pure / hybrid ) according to solving 224 process ( Ohlsson , et al . , 1992 ; Weisberg , 1995 ; Ansburg & Dominowski , 2000 ) , the heterogeneous 225 nature of the various problem collections therefore makes equivalence studies difficult ( Weisberg , 226 1995 ; Cunningham , et al . , 2009 ) , and this limits our understanding of the core components of 227 problem solving with insight ( Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003b ; MacGregor & Cunningham , 2008 ) . 228 Attempts to find one single explanation of the cognitive processes leading to insight solution by 229 pitting alternative theories against each other on a single puzzle type ( e . g . Jones , 2003 ) may on this 230 account be doomed : it is entirely possible that insight could arise from different interacting sets of 231 preceding processes depending upon the context and the challenge inherent in the problem and 232 that these processes may only imperfectly map onto these traditional problem type categories 233 ( Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2007 ; Shen , et al . , 2016 ) . A theoretical or computational model of ‘insight 234 problem’ solving which satisfactorily explains all facets and styles of insight challenge is therefore 235 proving elusive ( Ash , et al . , 2009 ; Batchelder & Alexander , 2012 ) . 236 237 Rapid Solving and Incubated Problems 238 Equally vexed is the question of whether a period of impasse is always involved in ‘insight problem’ - 239 solving ( as argued e . g . by Ohlsson , et al . , 1992 ) , with some studies reporting that - even within 240 puzzle type - solvers did not uniformly experience a period of impasse ( Cranford & Moss , 2012 ; Ash , 241 Jee , & Wiley , 2012 ; Danek , et al . , 2014a ) . 242 243 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 8 Indeed , studies have suggested that solvers can experience an instantaneous ‘Aha ! ’ moment within 244 seconds of the presentation of the puzzle . In a study of anagram solving , Novick and Sherman noted 245 that ‘pop - out’ solutions tended to be the first solution offered and to occur within 2 seconds of the 246 presentation of the letters ( Novick & Sherman , 2003 ) . In trials of highly skilled anagram solvers , 47 % 247 of the solutions were reported to be immediate ‘pop - out’ solutions , where the solver agreed that , 248 “The solution came to mind suddenly , seemingly out of nowhere . I have no awareness of having 249 done anything to try to get the answer . ” By contrast 27 % of solutions occurred with insight after a 250 period of trying fruitless combinations ; and 26 % were generated incrementally by the recursive 251 testing of morphemically probable combinations ( non - insight search solutions ) . 252 253 Similarly , a study of RAT problems ( Cranford & Moss , 2012 ) , found that 171 out of 218 solutions 254 arrived at with self - reported insight , under think - aloud conditions , were solved almost immediately , 255 in a mean time of 7 . 1 seconds . These were categorized as ‘Immediate Insight’ ( II ) moments ; 256 however , the authors also raised the possibility that the solution might simply have occurred so fast 257 that it appeared sudden and surprising , without evoking the full phenomenological experience 258 ( Cranford & Moss , 2012 ; see also Topolinski & Reber , 2010b ) . Indeed , an fMRI study comparing II 259 with Delayed Insight ( DI ) RAT solutions showed large differences in activation patterns for the two 260 types of insight , suggesting that they may represent distinct solution processes ( Cranford & Moss , 261 2011 ) . For this reason , some later studies have excluded II solutions from their discussion , on the 262 grounds that they may not reflect the full “Aha ! ” experience ( e . g . Salvi , Bricolo , Kounios , Bowden , & 263 Beeman , 2016 ) . 264 265 Conversely , the benefits of a period of incubation ( non - conscious solving activity , or a period of 266 respite away from the problem ) in resolving problems which have reached impasse have been well - 267 documented ( see the meta - analytic review by Sio & Ormerod , 2009 ; also Ohlsson , 2011 ; Baird , et al . , 268 2012 ; Sio & Ormerod , 2015 ; Gilhooly , 2016 ) , although the mechanisms which account for the 269 facilitation of the solution ( e . g . ‘unconscious work’ , ‘intermittent work’ , ‘beneficial forgetting’ - 270 Gilhooly , 2016 ) are as yet unclear . Incubation is clearly not always involved in insight problem 271 resolution - though it was present as the second of Wallas’ ( 1926 ) four stages of insight problem - 272 solving ( Sio & Ormerod , 2009 ) - and is rather seen as an ancillary feature , to be utilized where 273 necessary ( Gilhooly , 2016 ) . Engaging in a diversionary activity with a low cognitive load appears to 274 be most helpful ( Sio & Ormerod , 2009 ) , and many people report that the problem solution occurs to 275 them when engaged in everyday activities such as walking , driving or showering ( Ovington , Saliba , 276 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 9 Moran , Goldring , & MacDonald , 2015 ; Hill & Kemp , 2016 ) ; a substantial number also report 277 facilitation overnight , during their dreams or immediately upon waking ( Ovington , et al . , 2015 ) . 278 279 Cryptic Crosswords as potential triggers of Insight 280 Cryptic ( British - style ) crosswords afford a unique opportunity to explore the mechanisms of insight 281 and the issues highlighted above within an existing , readily available puzzle format . Devised in the 282 mid 1920’s ( Connor , 2014 ) , cryptic crosswords employ an extensive variety of highly ingenious 283 puzzle mechanisms , many of which also draw on shared characteristics with a range of other types 284 of ‘insight problem’ ( see review below ) . One puzzle may thus encapsulate a wide range of these 285 mechanisms , presenting a compendium of heterogeneous insight challenges unrivalled by any other 286 insight puzzle format . Studying cryptic crosswords may therefore enable us to understand better the 287 antecedents , solving processes and key triggers of the insight moment . 288 289 What are ‘cryptic crosswords’ ? 290 The nature of the cryptic crossword has been described in some detail in an earlier paper 291 ( Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ) , but key aspects are highlighted again below . Example cryptic crossword 292 clues , together with an explanation of the cryptic instructions for achieving the required solution , 293 are set out in Boxes 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 and 6 . < insert box 1 somewhere around here > . 294 Unlike their ‘straight definition’ American cousins , the challenge of the British - style cryptic 295 crossword lies not in the obscurity of the vocabulary to be retrieved , but in the quasi - algebraic 296 coded instructions which must be executed precisely in order to achieve the correct answer to the 297 clue ( Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ) : see Box 1 . Cryptic crossword clues usually comprise two elements : a 298 straight definition , plus the cryptic instructions for assembling the required solution—the 299 “wordplay” ( Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ; Pham , 2016 ) . It is not always obvious which part of the clue is 300 fulfilling what role , and there is often no clear division between the two parts ( Friedlander & Fine , 301 2016 ) . Even the ‘definitional’ element of the clue might be obliquely or whimsically referenced , 302 consciously exploiting ambiguities such as grammatical form , phrasal semantics , homophones , 303 synonyms and roundabout expressions ( Cleary , 1996 ; Aarons , 2015 ; Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ) . The 304 clue type also has to be identified and interpreted . All these factors mean that that cryptic 305 crosswords are typically ill - defined in both problem conceptualization and solution methodology 306 ( Johnstone , 2001 ) . 307 308 Each cryptic crossword clue is thus a tricky linguistic puzzle using non - literal interpretations of 309 deconstructed clue components in a ‘truly slippery and fundamentally ambiguous’ fashion ( Aarons , 310 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 10 2012 , p . 224 ) , stretching the conventions of everyday speech at all levels of structure and context 311 ( Aarons , 2015 ) . The misdirection is deliberate : the surface reading of the clue evokes our tacit 312 knowledge of language to suggest a plausible , yet unhelpful , interpretation of the clue ( the ‘red 313 herring’ ) , setting up a constraint which must be resolved for progress to be made ( Aarons , 2015 ; 314 Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ) . Once accomplished , the ‘Aha ! ’ experience is triggered : this is termed the 315 ‘Penny Dropping Moment’ or ‘PDM’ by crossword solvers ( Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ) . 316 317 In this use of misdirection , cryptic crosswords are similar to magic tricks : in both areas , the 318 practitioner exploits implicit assumptions of the audience which are activated highly automatically , 319 either ( in magic ) because of long - term exposure to the natural laws governing everyday life , such as 320 gravity ( Danek , et al . , 2014b ) or ( in crosswords ) because of a lifetime’s parsing habits as a reader 321 and interpreter of standard text ( Schulman , 1996 ) . The task of the setter , as for the magician , is to 322 conceal the clue mechanism so subtly that the pathway is not readily detectable ( Friedlander & Fine , 323 2016 ) . 324 325 Once deconstructed in this manner , there is no requirement for the cryptic components to make 326 further sense as a coherent whole : the beguilingly smooth surface reading of the clue is typically 327 abandoned in favor of a potpourri of dissociated cryptic fragments , each serving a quite different 328 purpose entirely ungoverned by word - order , grammatical or orthographic considerations ( Pham , 329 2016 ) . In this way cryptic crosswords can be seen as a type of ‘non - bona fide communication’ 330 ( Aarons , 2015 , p . 357 ) : the solver understands that the normal rules of communication must be 331 temporarily suspended ( just as they are required to suspend disbelief at a magic show ) , and that the 332 clue itself is simply a vehicle for the intellectual challenge of solving the clue . 333 334 Range of cryptic clue challenges and parallels with other insight problems 335 Although there is general agreement that the clues have to be fairly constructed ( i . e . , 336 unambiguously solvable ) , there are no hard - and - fast guidelines as to what the rules of engagement 337 are ( Aarons , 2015 ; Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ) , leading to an almost infinite number of innovative 338 ways to exploit the “versatile and quirky English language” ( Connor , 2013 ) . Nevertheless , there is 339 some consensus over a number of basic mechanism types , and a range of “Teach - Yourself” primers 340 exist ( Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ; see also now the on - line solving channel - Anthony & Goodliffe , 341 vlog ) . A brief review of the most striking parallels between a variety of insight puzzles and the 342 mechanics of solving cryptic crosswords follows . 343 344 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 11 Jokes and cryptic crosswords : deliberate misdirection 345 Individual differences in the ability to appreciate humor have been previously identified 346 ( Cunningham & Derks , 2005 ; Kozbelt & Nishioka , 2010 ; Dunbar , Launay , & Curry , 2016 ) and cryptic 347 crossword solvers appear to be particularly attuned to and to enjoy verbal ambiguity and wordplay . 348 In a study involving solvers and non - solvers ( Underwood , MacKeith , & Everatt , 1988 ) the strongest 349 correlation associated with cryptic puzzle - solving was the frequency of incidentally elicited laughter 350 during an experiment involving associative priming ( e . g . ‘strawberry’ priming ‘traffic’ through the 351 unpresented word ‘jam’ ) . 352 353 Linguistic jokes share many characteristics with cryptic crosswords , including deliberate misdirection 354 ( Aarons , 2015 ) , and - although only rarely used as such in the lab - jokes have been identified as a 355 type of insight puzzle ( Gick & Lockhart , 1995 ; Ramachandran , 1998 ; Robertson , 2001 ; Kounios & 356 Jung - Beeman , 2009 ; Kozbelt & Nishioka , 2010 ; Amir , Biederman , Wang , & Xu , 2015 ) on the basis of 357 the suddenness and rapidity of the solution , the lack of ‘feeling - of - warmth’ , the pleasant feelings 358 evoked at the moment of understanding , and the feeling of certainty in the correctness of the 359 solution . A punning joke is typically based on two alternative interpretations of a scripted feed - line , 360 which are both plausible in some sense , however absurd , ‘until the punchline , which highlights the 361 initially less obvious one , and reveals the other to be a dummy , designed intentionally to mislead the 362 listener’ ( Aarons , 2015 , p . 352 ) . 363 364 Working in a parallel tradition to that of psychological insight studies , linguistic humor studies have 365 long explored the operation of jokes in the context of a two - stage process of ‘Incongruity - 366 Resolution’ ( for a review see Forabosco , 2008 ) , which shares many points of similarity with RCT . 367 ‘Incongruity - Resolution’ proposes that the expectations of the joke’s audience are deliberately 368 manipulated to predict a sensible , but incorrect outcome , making the actual punchline initially 369 unexpected or incongruous ( the ’surprise’ phase ) . In the second phase ( termed ‘coherence’ ) , the 370 listener then engages in a rapid form of problem - solving in order to revisit and resolve the 371 incongruity , enabling the punchline to make plausible sense once it has been reconciled with an 372 amusing and perhaps off - beat alternative interpretation of the original joke setting ( Suls , 1972 ; 373 Bartolo , Benuzzi , Nocetti , Baraldi , & Nichelli , 2006 ; Forabosco , 2008 ; Hurley , Dennett , & Adams , 374 2011 ; Canestrari & Bianchi , 2012 ) . In other words , they must backtrack to search for an implicit 375 constraint in their interpretation of the joke wording , which can be relaxed sufficiently to 376 accommodate both the joke setting and its punchline within a revised interpretative structure ( Suls , 377 1972 ; Navon , 1988 ) . This process takes only a short time : there is an inverted relationship between 378 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 12 speed of appreciation and funniness ratings ( Cunningham & Derks , 2005 ; Kozbelt & Nishioka , 2010 ) , 379 and a joke falls flat if the explanation is too labored ( Kozbelt & Nishioka , 2010 ) . 380 381 If interpreted literally , the initially less dominant meaning ( ‘latent content’ - Kozbelt & Nishioka , 382 2010 ; Erdelyi , 2014 ) underpinning the correct interpretation of the punchline is often inappropriate , 383 impossible or surreal : an ‘as if’ resolution ( Navon , 1988 ; Amir , et al . , 2015 ) which is “seemingly 384 appropriate but virtually inappropriate” ( Navon , 1988 , p . 210 ) and - as for cryptic crosswords and 385 magic tricks - functions “only on account of a willing suspension of disbelief” ( Attardo , Hempelmann , 386 & Di Maio , 2002 , p . 5 ) . It is at this point that we experience the emotional payback , as we ’get’ the 387 joke , with the sudden , absurd resolution eliciting laughter ; recent studies have begun to explore the 388 neural correlates of these humorous insight moments ( Amir , et al . , 2015 ; Chan , 2016 ) . 389 390 The workings of this mechanism are exemplified in the following joke : 391 ‘So , I bought some animal crackers , and the box said : 392 “Do not consume if the seal is broken”…’ ( attrib . Brian Kiley ) 393 Here , the listener is primed to interpret the term ‘seal’ in terms of the intact packaging containing 394 the foodstuff . The punchline seems incongruously out of place given that a joke is ostensibly being 395 recounted : it appears to be a banal repetition of standard wording commonly found on packaged 396 goods , and is not inherently amusing . The feeling of ‘missing something’ - that “ nagging sort of 397 anxiety when you sense that something is funny - huh” ( Hurley , et al . , 2011 , p . 79 ) evokes an 398 uncomfortable state of incongruity akin to cognitive dissonance ( Festinger , 1957 ; Forabosco , 2008 ; 399 Yim , 2016 ) , and this discomfort will provide the motivational drive to reconcile or reduce the 400 perceived inconsistency by reassessing the initial interpretation of the joke setting . It is only upon 401 reinterpreting the word ‘seal’ ( in the context of ‘animal crackers’ ) that the alternative and 402 nonsensical latent content of the joke emerges : that the crackers should not be eaten if the seal 403 biscuit is broken . 404 405 Similarly , the cryptic crossword clue at Box 2 ( a ) leads initially to a deceptively straightforward 406 solution ( ’Scared stiff’ ) , which perhaps only subsequently reveals the underlying pun ‘Stiff - > Corpse - 407 > Frightened to death’ , confirming the accuracy of the solution . 408 409 < INSERT BOX 2 SOMEWHERE HERE > 410 411 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 13 Fundamental to punning humor of this nature is the concept of ‘bisociation’ – the perceiving of a 412 situation in two incompatible frames of reference ( Koestler , 1964 ; Dienhart , 1999 ; Canestrari & 413 Bianchi , 2012 ) . Following this account , ambiguous phonetic forms such as homophones , homonyms 414 and polysemes can act as triggers which abruptly switch the listener from one semantic script ( e . g . 415 ‘seal = box packaging’ ) to another ( e . g . ‘seal = biscuit shape’ ) . Koestler sees this as a sudden ‘Gestalt’ 416 reversal ( Koestler , 1964 ) . 417 418 Key to the workings of the joke or crossword clue is the initial concealment of the alternative 419 meaning ; and indeed it is a general feature of insight puzzles that the solution typically involves a 420 statistically infrequent response , such as an unusual use for an object , or a less familiar , less 421 dominant meaning for a word or phrase ( Dominowski , 1995 ) . So , for example , the cryptic crossword 422 clue at Box 2 ( b ) requires the solver to recognize that a potential solution word ( ’unearthed’ ) , in its 423 prototypical sense of ‘discovered’ , has a second , non - intuitive but highly appropriate role to play in 424 the clue ( ’without an earth wire’ ) . 425 426 The cryptic crossword solver is thus often gulled into a readily available , but false interpretation of 427 the clue setting ( the ‘surface reading’ ) based on a prima facie interpretation of everyday linguistic 428 rules , ambiguous phonetic forms , learned phraseological conventions , and context . This approach 429 leads initially to nagging puzzlement , impasse and cognitive dissonance , since the original 430 interpretation cannot be made to yield the desired answer ( the solver is ‘missing something’ ) . This 431 provides the motivation to detect and explore alternative interpretations ( some perhaps fruitlessly ) 432 in order to arrive at the moment of insight . As with jokes , the cryptic crossword’s ‘pay - off’ ( the final 433 understanding of the clue ) arrives when the original constraints are abruptly overturned in favor of a 434 switch to an alternative , non - intuitive reading of the cryptic elements - often leading to surprise , 435 laughter and the delight of the PDM ( Aarons , 2015 ) . No matter how lengthy and difficult this 436 problem - solving phase has been , the clue is typically processed rapidly once the constraint is cracked 437 ( Topolinski & Reber , 2010a ) . 438 439 Rebus puzzles and cryptic crosswords : reinterpretation of visual / spatial elements 440 Although many cryptic crossword clues rely heavily on punning misdirection , many also employ clue 441 mechanisms which indicate that letters or letter blocks must be transposed , reversed , removed , 442 substituted , extracted from a sequence or read as an acrostic ( Aarons , 2015 ) . In these clues , the 443 elements providing the wordplay fodder must be decontextualized from the natural surface reading , 444 either abandoning meaning altogether , or taking on new meaning of their own . Once these problem - 445 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 14 irrelevant ‘chunks’ have been decomposed ( Knoblich , et al . , 1999 ) the components are redeployed 446 in quasi - algebraic fashion to form new units answering to the clue definition ( Friedlander & Fine , 447 2016 ) : see further Box 1 . 448 449 One clue type of this nature is the ‘charade’ : a type of riddle in which the whole word is hinted at 450 enigmatically by reference to its component syllables ( Chambers , 2014 ) . In this process , cryptic 451 crosswords may not observe morphological rules : for example , the word ‘ discourage’ would be 452 segmented linguistically as ‘ dis - courage’ , but in a cryptic crossword might be clued , as ‘ Di ( girl’s 453 name ) + scour + age ’ ( Aarons , 2015 ) . See further clues 1 ( a ) and 4 ( f ) in Boxes 1 and 4 . 454 455 < INSERT BOX 3 SOMEWHERE HERE > 456 457 Similarly , rebus puzzles rely on the manipulation of words and word fragments to suggest common 458 phrases which fit the clues displayed in a ‘word - picture’ . Common rebus types involve charades , the 459 interpretation of the spatial locations of words in relation to each other , typographical trends ( letter 460 size growing , decreasing ) , font size or color ( capitalization etc . ) , numbers , and letters as words 461 ( MacGregor & Cunningham , 2008 ; Salvi , Costantini , et al . , 2016 ) : see examples in Box 3 . Rebus 462 puzzles are also examples of ill - defined problems ( Salvi , Costantini , et al . , 2016 ) : the mechanisms for 463 achieving the problem solution are unclear to the solver , who may have to try multiple strategies 464 before hitting upon a productive approach . As with cryptic crosswords , the solver has to relax the 465 ingrained rules of reading in order to overcome their tacit understanding of word - form and 466 contextual interpretation and to achieve a restructuring of the problem space ( Salvi , Costantini , et 467 al . , 2016 ) . For this reason , they are likely to trigger the insight experience ( MacGregor & 468 Cunningham , 2008 ; Salvi , Costantini , et al . , 2016 ) . 469 470 Rebus puzzles typically rely on the literal and quirky interpretation of encrypted elements and their 471 spatial arrangement , which are interpreted as part of the solution ( MacGregor & Cunningham , 472 2008 ) . In the British TV programme ‘ Catchphrase ’ , which was based upon the solving of pictorially 473 displayed rebus - type puzzles , the host , Roy Walker , used the tag line “Say what you see” in order to 474 prompt contestants to find the solution ( Wikipedia , 2017b ) . This is precisely the approach needed by 475 a number of the rebus - style cryptic crossword clues in Box 4 which use highly inventive gimmicks to 476 cryptically represent the solution word ( clues 4 b - e ) . 477 478 < INSERT BOX 4 SOMEWHERE HERE > 479 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 15 480 Anagrams and cryptic crosswords : dechunking , pattern detection and misdirection 481 Anagrams have been routinely used in investigations of insight ( for a review , see Ellis , Glaholt , & 482 Reingold , 2011 ) - both for anagram solving ( e . g . Novick & Sherman , 2003 ; Kounios , et al . , 2008 ; Salvi , 483 Bricolo , et al . , 2016 ) and through the use of a paradigm requiring a simple judgment as to whether 484 the anagram was solvable or not , in order to explore ‘feelings of warmth’ and solution speed ( e . g . 485 Novick & Sherman , 2003 ; Topolinski & Reber , 2010b ) . 486 487 Studies of anagram solution have consistently reported that solvers approach anagram problems 488 using two different strategies ( e . g . Novick & Sherman , 2003 ; Kounios , et al . , 2008 ; Ellis , et al . , 2011 ; 489 Salvi , Bricolo , et al . , 2016 ) : a search methodology , using a process of serially testing out and rejecting 490 solutions based on morphemically probable letter combinations ; and ‘pop - out’ solutions ( Novick & 491 Sherman , 2003 ) whereby the solution bursts suddenly into consciousness without apparent work , 492 often almost instantaneously . EEG research has demonstrated that self - reports distinguishing 493 between ‘pop - out’ and search anagram solving are reliably accurate ( Kounios , et al . , 2008 ) ; this 494 study also provides evidence that individual differences determine the solver’s preferred strategy , 495 and that different patterns of brain activity are associated with the two approaches . 496 497 It is well - established that structural features of the letter stimuli which are to be anagrammed ( such 498 as whether they are pronounceable , or form a real word in their own right ) affect the difficulty and 499 solution times of the puzzle . Thus , ZELBA or OARLY should be more difficult to resolve than HNWEI 500 or AOSLR ; and HEART should be more difficult to unscramble than THREA ( Dominowski , 1969 ; 501 Novick & Sherman , 2008 ; Ellis & Reingold , 2014 ; for a review see Topolinski , Bakhtiari , & Erle , 2016 ) . 502 Dominowski suggests that the pronounceability of the letters leads solvers to deal with them as a 503 unit rather than as a letter - sequence ( Dominowski , 1969 ) : in other words , that familiarity with the 504 letter patterns sets up an obstacle to solution by accessing automatically stored ‘chunks’ of data 505 which will be inappropriate to the solution ( cf . Knoblich , et al . , 1999 ) . It is the decomposing of these 506 chunks into component letters which paves the way to the solution . 507 508 Anagram clues are a staple of cryptic crosswords ( Upadhyay , 2008b ; Aarons , 2015 p . 371 ) , being 509 formed of the letters to be anagrammed ( the ‘fodder’ ) , an anagram indicator and the definition of 510 the resulting word ( see Box 5 ) . The letter fodder is typically concealed in misleading word units , 511 which will be unhelpful to the anagram solution as indicated above ; for this reason , many solvers will 512 write out the letter - fodder in a random arrangement ( such as a circle ) , in order to try to break up the 513 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 16 prior associations and allow new patterns to form ( Johnstone , 2001 - see Box 5 ) . However , difficulty 514 can also be heightened by misdirection in the surface reading and by heavy disguise of the anagram 515 indicator . 516 517 518 Remote Association Puzzles and Cryptic Crosswords : Spreading Activation 519 The Remote Associates Test ( RAT ) , originally developed as a test of creativity ( Mednick , 1962 ) , has 520 been refined and updated on a number of occasions , resulting in several sets of test materials 521 ( Functional Remote Associates Test ( FRAT ) Worthen & Clark , 1971 ; Compound Remote Associates 522 ( CRA ) Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003b ) , and has been translated into a number of languages ( Salvi , 523 Costantini , et al . , 2016 ) . The task challenge is for the participant to consider a triad of apparently 524 unconnected words ( e . g . Cottage , Swiss , Cake ) and to come up with a fourth word ( here ‘ Cheese’ ) 525 which is related to all three through some type of associative connective link . 526 527 Although no longer commonly used as a test of creativity per se ( Salvi , Costantini , et al . , 2016 ) , 528 remote association puzzles are frequently used to study facets of creative problem - solving such as 529 insight ( Bowden , et al . , 2005 ; MacGregor & Cunningham , 2008 ; Cranford & Moss , 2012 ; Jarosz , et 530 al . , 2012 ; Chein & Weisberg , 2014 ; Salvi , Bricolo , Franconeri , Kounios , & Beeman , 2015 ; Webb , et al . , 531 2016 ) , incubation effects ( Smith & Blankenship , 1991 ; Cai , Mednick , Harrison , Kanady , & Mednick , 532 2009 ; Sio & Ormerod , 2015 ) , and fixedness upon the wrong solution ( Smith & Blankenship , 1989 , 533 1991 ) . 534 535 RAT puzzles are thought to operate through a serendipitous spreading neuronal network ( Collins & 536 Loftus , 1975 ) akin to three ripples , whereby each triad member simultaneously but independently 537 activates a retrieval search of semantic memory ( Smith , Sifonis , & Angello , 2012 ; Kenett , Anaki , & 538 Faust , 2014 ; Olteţeanu & Falomir , 2015 ) . This global search operates as a multiple constraint 539 problem , each cue word indicating a different attribute of the target word to be satisfied ; the 540 solution is arrived at by confluence of the ripples upon a jointly shared node ( Gupta , Jang , Mednick , 541 & Huber , 2012 ; Smith , Huber , & Vul , 2013 ) . 542 543 Alternatively , participants can adopt a more controlled generate - and - test strategy by considering 544 just one of the three cues at a time , and testing out candidate solutions against each constraint for 545 suitability , to ensure all requirements are met ( Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2007 ; Smith , et al . , 2013 ) . 546 This type of analytic , step - wise process is associated with lower insight ratings and different patterns 547 of neural activity and eye movements when compared to sudden , non - methodical solutions 548 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 17 ( Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003a ; Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2007 ; Subramaniam , Kounios , Parrish , & 549 Jung - Beeman , 2009 ; Cranford & Moss , 2012 ; Salvi , Costantini , et al . , 2016 ; Webb , et al . , 2016 ) . 550 551 Impasse in solving RAT puzzles can arise from a fixation upon incorrect words , particularly those 552 which are closely associated , syntactically or semantically , with one or more of the target words , and 553 which therefore spring easily to mind ( Harkins , 2006 ; Gupta , et al . , 2012 ) . This blocks access to more 554 remotely associated words needed for the solution ( Gupta , et al . , 2012 ) . Indeed , fixation in RAT 555 problem - solving can be deliberately induced by priming commonplace associations which are 556 unhelpful to the correct solution of the problem ( Smith & Blankenship , 1991 ) . 557 558 Consequently , one factor leading to higher performance on RAT puzzles is the ability to avoid a bias 559 towards high - frequency candidate answers , thus allowing more remotely associated possibilities to 560 be accessed ( Gupta , et al . , 2012 ) . This accords well with Mednick’s conceptualization of an 561 uncreative person as one who possesses a ‘steep associative hierarchy’ containing an initially high 562 number of stereotypical responses which rapidly tail off . By contrast , the highly creative individual 563 will possess a ‘flat associative hierarchy’ containing many more items , and fewer stereotypical 564 responses ( Mednick , 1962 p . 223 ) . Creative individuals are thus argued to possess more associative 565 links , leading to a more complex and less rigid lexical network ( Gruszka & Necka , 2002 ; Kenett , et al . , 566 2014 ) . 567 568 In general terms , RAT puzzles pose a similar challenge to the ‘definition’ in cryptic crosswords , which 569 may reference the target word with considerable concealment . In many cases , the sense required 570 will not be the dominant association , but a secondary meaning ( sometimes quite obscure ) which will 571 come much less readily to mind , and fixation upon the wrong sense is often deliberately induced by 572 contextual means ( Cleary , 1996 - see Box 1 ( c ) ) . Breaking free from the stereotypical interpretation in 573 order to consider a range of potentially remote synonym options is therefore key to lighting upon 574 the correct solution ( cf . Dominowski , 1995 ) . 575 576 Even closer to the format of the RAT puzzle , however , is the ‘double definition’ clue ( Biddlecombe , 577 2009 ; Connor , 2011a ; Aarons , 2015 ) , whereby the solver is presented with two words , both of which 578 can be defined by the same polysemic or homographic solution word ( Aarons , 2015 ; Pham , 2016 ) . 579 Occasionally , triad cryptic definitions ( or even quadruple / quintuple ) are also found ( Connor , 2011a - 580 see Box 6 ) . As in jokes , double definition clues operate through ‘bisociation’ and an unexpected pay - 581 off : ‘the fun of seeing two disparate concepts suddenly become one’ ( Connor , 2011a ) . 582 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 18 583 < INSERT BOX 6 SOMEWHERE HERE > 584 585 Although the mechanism illustrated in Box 6 is very similar to that of RAT puzzles ( ’What one word 586 links the following words ? ’ ) , cryptic double definitions present extra difficulties , introducing 587 elements of misdirection which are generally absent in RATs . First , in a dyad pairing , the two words 588 are typically selected to form a familiar but unhelpful phrase with meaning of its own ( e . g . 6 ( a ) ’tea 589 shop’ ) , creating a distracting red herring ( Connor , 2011a ) . This automatically triggered impasse must 590 be resolved by decomposing the unhelpful ‘chunked’ phrase into its component features , allowing 591 for an alternative parsing of the problem elements ( Knoblich , et al . , 1999 ) . Secondly , at least one of 592 the words is usually ‘multicategorical’ , meaning that it can used as different parts of speech in each 593 of the clue and the solution ( Aarons , 2015 ) . Finally , the solver must identify the ‘double definition’ 594 mechanism unaided , since there is no clue - type indicator for this class ( Upadhyay , 2008a ) . For all 595 these reasons , double definitions can be one of the hardest clue types to crack ( Connor , 2011a ) , 596 requiring multiple constraining misconceptions about the meaning , form and function of the clue 597 elements to be resolved . 598 599 Advanced Cryptic Crosswords 600 So far , this article has only considered cryptic clues which might appear in daily ‘block - style’ cryptic 601 puzzles ( Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ) . However , a second type of cryptic crossword - advanced cryptics 602 - also exists , which raises the difficulty still further ( Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ) . Advanced cryptic 603 crosswords are found in weekend newspapers and some magazines , and the grids generally use bars 604 rather than blocked grids ( Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ) . Of these , the Listener Crossword is the most 605 notoriously difficult , employing a high degree of clue mechanism concealment , obscure vocabulary , 606 grids of startling originality and a thematic challenge , often involving a number of tricky lateral 607 thinking steps on the basis of minimal guidance ( Alberich , n . d . ; Listener Editorial Team , 2013 ) . 608 Solvers submit weekly solutions for the distinction of appearing on an annual roll of honor , but few 609 achieve an all - correct year ( Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ) . The Magpie , 1 a monthly specialist magazine 610 with five highly challenging advanced cryptic crosswords ( and one mathematical puzzle ) per issue , 611 runs a similar all correct / roll of honor system , and is broadly of Listener standard ( Friedlander & 612 Fine , 2016 ) . 613 614 1 http : / / www . piemag . com / about / . I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 19 It is difficult to pigeon - hole the challenges set by advanced cryptics : there is an acute thirst for 615 originality among the aficionados of these puzzles which drives setters to produce ever more 616 creative designs , mechanisms and themes which ‘require original thinking by the solver over and 617 over again’ ( Anthony , 2015 ) , and annual awards for the most admired crossword in the Magpie and 618 Listener series are presented to setters on the basis of solver recommendation ( e . g . the Listener 619 ‘Ascot Gold Cup’ 2 ) . However , two particularly prominent sources of challenge are described below . 620 621 Thematic challenge : acquisition of incidental hints 622 Many advanced cryptic puzzles contain a thematic challenge , lending extra difficulty to the puzzle . In 623 one common approach , a number of thematically related entries may have no clue , requiring the 624 solver to deduce the answers gradually from cross - checking letters , as the grid is populated . 625 Additionally , entire areas of the grid - such as the complete perimeter - may need to be completed 626 with thematically relevant items or messages . In other puzzles , letter sequences spelling out 627 thematic material may be concealed in the grid ( for example on the diagonals ) , requiring the solver 628 to find and highlight them through a ‘wordsearch’ process ( Alberich , n . d . ) . 629 630 Thematic puzzles rely upon the solver’s ability to make cross - connections between seemingly 631 disparate items drawn from unpredictable and often obscure fields of knowledge : in this they share 632 similarities with lateral thinking quizzes such as BBC2’s Only Connect and BBC Radio 4’s Round Britain 633 Quiz ( Connor , 2016 ) . Once again , the problem space is ill - defined : the nature of the connection , the 634 goal state and the pathway to achieve coherence are all unspecified . 635 636 In order to solve these puzzles , solvers have to accumulate incidental information along the way : 637 hints in the title or preamble might point obliquely to the theme ; suggestive word fragments might 638 appear in the grid , and thematic material might be gradually spelled out by other means - such as 639 corrections to misprints in the clues . The PDM comes at the instant when all the disparate pieces of 640 information suddenly come together to make sense . It is therefore comparatively rare for the theme 641 to be deduced from the start ( indeed this element of the puzzle is often termed the ‘endgame’ ) : the 642 solver must be able to tolerate - or even enjoy - the sensation of working for some time with unclear 643 goals and incomplete , potentially conflicting and imprecise data . This may imply that advanced 644 cryptic solvers tend towards personality traits such as a low ‘Need for Closure’ - the desire for 645 definite knowledge and resolution of an issue ( Webster & Kruglanski , 1994 ) ; and a high ‘Tolerance of 646 Ambiguity’ - the perceiving of ambiguous situations as desirable , challenging and interesting 647 2 http : / / www . listenercrossword . com / List _ Awards . html I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 20 ( Furnham , 1994 ; Zenasni , Besancon , & Lubart , 2008 ) . Earlier research has also found that cryptic 648 crossword solvers generally have a high ‘Need for Cognition’ , relating to a person ' s tendency to seek 649 out , engage in and enjoy effortful thinking ( Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ; see Cacioppo , Petty , & Kao , 650 1984 ; Von Stumm & Ackerman , 2013 ; Furnham & Thorne , 2013 ) . 651 652 An example of a thematic cryptic crossword challenge is shown in figure 2 . Here the well - known 653 children’s song ‘Old MacDonald Had a Farm’ is used as a source of thematic material : “the super - 654 familiar hiding under a thick cloak of obscurity , waiting to reward the determined solver with a PDM 655 that feels like a surprise from an old friend” ( Editorial Notes , 2013 p . 10 ) . 656 657 < Insert Figure 2 somewhere here > 658 659 Given the richness of the thematic material in this puzzle , which is expressed through multiple 660 different devices ( MacDonalds , animal noises , EIEIO title and the notation in the grid ) , it is likely that 661 solvers experienced a number of PDMs - a series of mini ‘insight moments’ - en route to a final 662 solution . Some PDMs would almost certainly have come out of the blue : in particular , the concealed 663 instruction to correct the title by deleting consonants ”hides in a simple statement of fact a truly 664 surprising vowel - only “correct” title that nobody could possibly have seen coming” ( Editorial Notes , 665 2013 p . 10 ) . The finding of the tune proved trickier : 666 667 “The common experience was an initial search ( often for “MacDonald” ) , followed by some 668 confusion , followed by careful examination of the letters in the appropriate area , followed 669 maybe by re - reading the preamble , combined with spotting some suspect letter duplications 670 … in other words , a penny that did drop , but did it slowly” ( Editorial Notes , 2013 p . 10 ) . 671 672 As with RAT puzzles , thematic challenges appear to operate through a ripple of spreading activation 673 ( Collins & Loftus , 1975 ) . Each ‘clue to coherence’ ( Bowers , Regehr , Balthazard , & Parker , 1990 ) 674 embodies a different attribute of the target connection to be made ; when these unconscious 675 activations achieve confluence , the pattern emerges quite suddenly into consciousness , leading to 676 the perception of coherence , and the PDM ( a process described as ‘intuitive guiding’ - Bowers , et al . , 677 1990 ) . Individual differences will again arise in the speed , complexity and gradient of the available 678 interassociative connections ( Bowers , et al . , 1990 ; Gruszka & Necka , 2002 ; Smith , et al . , 2012 ; 679 Kenett , et al . , 2014 ) . 680 681 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 21 Individual differences in the ability to assimilate chance hints may also be relevant : as Louis Pasteur 682 famously remarked of his ostensibly fortuitous scientific discoveries , “Chance favors only the 683 prepared mind” ( Lecture , University of Lille , 7 December 1854 Seifert , et al . , 1995 ) . ‘Opportunistic 684 assimilation’ ( Seifert , et al . , 1995 ; Sio & Ormerod , 2015 ) refers to the ability to absorb new and 685 serendipitously presented information , and to allow these additional jigsaw pieces to resolve or 686 reframe one’s understanding of a problem which has previously reached impasse . Much may 687 depend on the initial preparation stage in which the solver becomes attuned to salient or important 688 features they have already noted ( Seifert , et al . , 1995 ; Ormerod , MacGregor , & Chronicle , 2002 ) 689 which they maintain at a heightened level of activation , leading to priming effects ( Sio & Ormerod , 690 2015 ) . Although potentially experiencing a number of failures and false leads in the process 691 ( Ormerod , et al . , 2002 ) , progress is then made when the solver becomes intrigued by further 692 patterns or anomalies ( Kolodner & Wills , 1996 ) , or stumbles across other relevant information 693 ( Weisberg , 2006 ) during completion of the grid . 694 695 The process is well - illustrated by the editorial feedback on Magpie 151 / 2 ‘ Five - a - side ( on Tour ) ’ by 696 Wan , which was themed around a subset of the 72 names of French scientists , engineers and 697 mathematicians engraved on the Eiffel Tower ( five from each side ) : 698 699 “In solving terms , there was a single critical , and memorable , moment of realisation when 700 the set of names suddenly made sense . This was normally preceded by a number of less 701 memorable moments of thinking that there was some other reason for grouping , by 702 nationality , or by specialisation , or by university affiliation , or whatever . All the false trails 703 had some value , because you were always going to be alert to French scientists or engineers 704 once a few showed up . The feeling was of constant small steps forward , always with some 705 difficulty , but never with that feeling of brick - wall despair that can accompany certain 706 thematic endgames . ” ( Editorial Notes , 2015 p . 9 ) . 707 708 Individual differences in openness to experience and sensitivity to external stimuli could be relevant 709 in these contexts , regulating the degree to which a person inhibits or remains subconsciously 710 receptive to ostensibly incidental information ( Laughlin , 1967 ; Simonton , 2003 ; Carson , Peterson , & 711 Higgins , 2003 ; Weisberg , 2006 ; Carson , 2010 ; Russ & Dillon , 2011 ) . A reduced tendency to pre - filter 712 extraneous information as irrelevant ( i . e . reduced latent inhibition ) may enhance the ability to make 713 lateral associations , and has been associated with both psychometrically and behaviorally assessed 714 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 22 creativity , openness to experience , and richer , more diverse associative networks ( Simonton , 2003 ; 715 Carson , 2010 ) . 716 717 Spatial or Transformational Challenges : Reconceptualizing the layout 718 An additional source of difficulty in many advanced cryptic crosswords lies in the transformation of 719 some elements . For example , some or all of the answers might need to be encoded or otherwise 720 thematically altered before being entered in the grid . As in American - style ‘variety puzzles’ , such as 721 those appearing periodically in the Sunday edition of the NY Times ( Wikipedia , 2017a ) , this might 722 involve anagramming , reversing or curtailing entries ( resulting in non - words in the grid ) ; but more 723 complex adjustments might also be required . For example the solver might deduce that all overlong 724 items , such as APHID ( to fit a grid space of 3 ) and CHINWAG ( to fit 5 ) , might need to be entered 725 using Greek characters to replace the English names for the Greek alphabet ( i . e . AΦD and XNWAG 726 Alberich , n . d . ) . Or all entries might need to be encoded using a Playfair cipher , with the keyword to 727 be deduced ( Upadhyay , 2015 ) . Once again , the problem space is ill - defined : the solver has to 728 assimilate key hints or salient features as the puzzle progresses in order to deduce what adjustments 729 need to be made , and may pursue a number of false leads before hitting upon the correct solution . 730 Meanwhile , the completion of the grid is made much harder by the absence of securely confirmed 731 cross - checking letters while the entry mechanism remains unresolved . 732 733 Further to this , some advanced cryptics require a type of restructuring in which the dimensions , 734 layout or salient features of the grid itself are changed ( see Figure 3 ) . In these puzzles , there is a 735 need to reconceptualize spatial assumptions involving placement and layout constraints , and to 736 dismantle an existing array in favor of a new , radically different format . Cunningham highlights these 737 two characteristics as strong features of classic spatially - oriented insight puzzles such as the nine - dot 738 problem , the ten - coin triangle and the chain necklace puzzle ( Cunningham , et al . , 2009 - figure 1 ) . 739 Difficulty is also heightened in many of these classic puzzles by the need to identify and verify what 740 the eventual solution would look like ( MacGregor , Ormerod , & Chronicle , 2001 ; Cunningham , et al . , 741 2009 ) : this prevents steady progress towards a concrete and visualizable goal state ( MacGregor , et 742 al . , 2001 ) , even if the eventual solution criteria and constraints are made clear . 743 744 < Insert figure 3 somewhere here > 745 746 So , for example , in figure 3 , the solver is made aware by means of a hidden message that the grid 747 must be cut up and reassembled ; but the purpose of this transformation , the eventual grid layout 748 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 23 and even the cutting line must all be deduced . Additional difficulty is introduced by the elliptical 749 reference to a ‘saw’ ; given the need to cut the grid and the zig - zag nature of the cut , the required 750 interpretation of the term ( ’saw’ = a maxim , saying ) might not spring to mind . Without 751 understanding this hint , the unspoken endgame ( that of reconstructing a well - known phrase along 752 the top and bottom line ) cannot be interpreted correctly . 753 754 Incidental support for cryptic crossword clues as a form of insight puzzle 755 The paper review set out above plausibly suggests that cryptic crosswords can function as insight 756 problems , using a variety of techniques , such as misdirection and an ill - defined problem space , to 757 increase the likelihood of an ‘Aha ! ’ response . However , following the methodology set out in the 758 ‘ Grounded Expertise Components Approach ’ ( GECA - Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ) , the first step in the 759 current research program was to secure empirically based corroboration for this a priori assumption . 760 761 Confirmation was therefore sought as part of an 84 - item broad - based questionnaire , intended to 762 characterize the cryptic crossword solving population across a wide number of dimensions . The full 763 methodology for this research was set out in a previous publication ( Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ) . In 764 total , 805 solvers across the full range of solving ability took part , although there was some attrition 765 towards the end of the survey . Solvers were objectively assigned to research categories on the basis 766 of benchmarked criteria , resulting in both a 2 - way ( Ordinary / Expert - O / E ) and a 3 - way 767 ( Ordinary / High ability / Super - Expert - O / H / S ) categorization of participant expertise . For full details 768 of the categorization rationale , see Friedlander & Fine ( 2016 ) . 769 770 One key hypothesis of the survey was that “cryptic crossword solving regularly generates “Aha ! ” or 771 insight moments , supporting the hypothesis that the cryptic clue is a type of insight problem through 772 misdirection ; and that this pleasurable experience is a salient driver of cryptic crossword 773 participation” ( Friedlander & Fine , 2016 , p . 7 ) . To this end , the survey included a number of questions 774 pertinent to the current discussion : results are presented below . All chi - square analyses are 775 bootstrapped and 95 % confidence intervals are reported in square brackets . 776 777 Evidence for the ‘Penny - Dropping Moment’ ( PDM ) and Incubation effects 778 779 PDM as a motivating experience 780 Participants were asked to rate 26 statements relating to their motivation for solving cryptic 781 crosswords on a 5 - point Likert scale ( 1 = ‘Completely Disagree’ ; 5 = ‘Completely Agree’ ) . There were 782 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 24 786 responses ( O : n = 388 ; H : n = 221 ; S : n = 177 ) . Table 1 ( A ) shows the five highest responses to these 783 26 statements ( with abbreviated descriptions ) . As previously reported ( Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ) all 784 groups rated the ‘Aha ! ’ moment ( PDM ) as a key motivational factor for solving cryptics ; closely allied 785 with this was the statement ‘Solving well - written clues gives me a buzz - it makes me smile or laugh 786 out loud’ which was ranked 4th in importance . The feeling of fulfilment - whether with the 787 completed grid or with the ‘uniquely satisfying’ cryptic crossword puzzle format - was also ranked 788 highly ( 2nd and 5th most important ) . There were no statistically significant differences between the 789 expertise groups for any of these statements . This suggests that - as for jokes - an important part of 790 the crossword puzzle - solving experience lies in the pleasurable emotional reward bound up with the 791 resolution of incongruity at the moment of insight . Studies of jokes and humor have found that 792 laughter is associated with the release of endorphins which may be important in this context : the 793 opiate effects of endorphins create a sense of wellbeing , pleasure and a sense of satisfaction 794 ( Dunbar , et al . , 2011 ) . By contrast , extrinsic motivators , such as prizes , competitions or public 795 acclaim , were not important to participants across the board ( Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ) . 796 797 < Table 1 is inserted somewhere here > 798 799 Incubation effect 800 In a separate series of questions intended to capture the solving preferences of participants , 801 respondents were invited to rate statements on a 3 - way Likert scale ( ’No / Never’ - 802 ’Perhaps / Sometimes’ - ’Yes / Always’ ; together with a null response option ‘Don’t know / Not 803 applicable’ ) . 796 responses were made ( O : 395 ; H : 223 ; S : 178 ) . Results are given in Table 1 ( B ) : 804 figures represent the summed percentage of “Sometimes” and “Always” responses unless otherwise 805 indicated . 806 807 Nearly 95 % of solvers ( 94 . 6 % ; O : 95 . 7 % ; H : 95 . 5 % ; S : 91 . 1 % ) confirmed that ‘incubation effects’ - 808 setting the crossword aside for a while , in order to resolve periods of impasse - were a feature of the 809 solving process . Indeed , 80 . 3 % of participants agreed with the full ‘Yes’ option : “ Yes - the answer is 810 often obvious when I return to the crossword” with a further 14 . 3 % agreeing that “ I sometimes find it 811 helpful to take a break , but I often return to the thoughts I was having previously” . S solvers were 812 least likely to have taken advantage of incubation breaks ; even so , differences in the distribution of 813 incubation effect between groups failed to reach statistical significance ( χ 2 ( 4 ) = 8 . 681 , p = . 070 , 814 Cramer’s V = . 074 [ . 040 , . 135 ] ) . 815 816 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 25 Conversely , S participants were most likely ( 84 . 8 % ) to have found that solutions occurred to them at 817 least occasionally when they were engaged in totally unrelated activities ( e . g . shopping , driving , 818 taking a bath ) . Overall 79 . 8 % of participants agreed with this statement ( O : 77 . 4 % ; H : 79 . 9 % ; S : 819 84 . 8 % ) , but differences between the groups again failed to reach statistical significance ( χ 2 ( 4 ) = 5 . 393 , 820 p = . 249 , Cramer’s V = . 058 [ . 032 , . 115 ] ) . 821 822 Impasse and the ‘Aha’ moment 823 Most participants also agreed that their enjoyment of the PDM was enhanced if they had needed to 824 struggle with a clue ( 79 . 6 % ; O : 83 . 8 % ; H : 78 . 0 % ; S : 72 . 5 % ) although some respondents claimed that 825 the ‘Aha ! ’ moment was unaffected by the effort expended ( 16 . 3 % ; O : 13 . 7 % ; H : 17 . 0 % ; S : 21 . 3 % ) . 826 Very few participants claimed either that it decreased with effort expended ( 2 . 6 % ) or that they had 827 never experienced a PDM ( 1 . 4 % ) when solving cryptics . Differences between groups approached , 828 but did not achieve statistical significance ( χ 2 ( 6 ) = 11 . 796 , p = . 067 , Cramer’s V = . 086 [ . 059 , . 153 ] ) and 829 inspection of standardized residuals indicated that this was driven by the higher number of S solvers 830 in the ‘Makes no difference’ group ( z = 1 . 7 ) . 831 832 Differences in solving approach between cryptic crossword expertise groups 833 Participants were also asked about their approach to solving cryptics in order to explore potential 834 differences between the expertise groups ; Table 2 highlights a number of key findings . 835 836 < insert Table 2 somewhere here > 837 838 Suppression of the misleading surface reading 839 Survey participants were asked to indicate whether they noticed the surface reading of a clue first , 840 or read it purely as code . Two response options ( ’I always read the surface meaning first’ , ‘I tend to 841 read the surface first’ ) favored the surface reading ; two options indicated that deliberate attempts 842 were made to exclude ‘reading for sense’ ( ’I try to exclude the misleading context’ , ‘I always read as 843 code : the surface meaning could be gobbledygook’ ) ; and there was one mid - way option ( ’Bit of both ; 844 not sure which predominates’ ) . 797 responses were made ( O : n = 395 ; H : n = 223 ; S : n = 179 ) ; 845 summarized details ( Surface / Bit of Both / Code ) are given in Table 2 ( A ) . 846 847 Most solvers ( 45 . 4 % ; O : 50 . 4 % ; H : 42 . 6 % ; S : 38 . 0 % ) selected the mid - way point , though this 848 decreased with expertise ; S solvers were most likely to suppress ‘reading for sense’ in favor of 849 ‘reading for code’ ( 36 . 3 % ) ; the opposite was true for O solvers , who tended to read much more for 850 sense ( 33 . 2 % ) . Differences between the groups were highly significant ( χ2 ( 4 ) = 33 . 21 , p < . 001 , 851 Cramer’s V = . 144 [ . 105 , . 199 ] ) and inspection of standardized residuals indicated that this was driven 852 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 26 by higher levels of H ( 31 . 8 % , z = 2 . 0 , p < . 05 ) and S ( 36 . 3 % , z = 3 . 0 , p < . 01 ) solvers who suppressed the 853 surface reading ; and lower levels of O solvers who did this ( 16 . 5 % , z = - 3 . 5 , p < . 001 ) . 854 855 Personal preferences leading to greater enjoyment of Advanced Cryptic crosswords 856 Solvers were asked to identify whether they solved Advanced Cryptic crosswords , and , if so , whether 857 the quality of the clueing or the tricky endgame ( or a bit of both ) was their primary source of 858 enjoyment ( Table 2 ( B ) ) . A small proportion of both expert groups chose not to solve Advanced 859 Cryptic crosswords , although this was higher for H solvers than for S ( ’I don’t do Advanced Cryptics’ : 860 8 . 0 % ; H 12 . 1 % ; S 2 . 8 % ) . O solvers , by definition , do not solve this type of crossword ( Friedlander & 861 Fine , 2016 , p . 8 ) and were omitted from this analysis . Where a preference was indicated , for H 862 solvers the quality of the clueing was paramount ( 27 . 4 % ; H 35 . 9 % ; S 16 . 8 % ) whereas , for a larger 863 number of S solvers , the lateral - thinking endgame was the most important attraction ( 20 . 9 % ; H 864 13 . 5 % ; S 30 . 2 % ) . Differences between the groups were highly significant ( χ2 ( 3 ) = 40 . 47 , p < . 001 , 865 Cramer’s V = . 317 [ . 226 , . 407 ] ) and inspection of standardized residuals indicated that this was driven 866 by higher levels of H ( 12 . 1 % , z = 2 . 2 , p < . 05 ) and lower levels of S ( 2 . 8 % , z = - 2 . 5 , p < . 05 ) who failed to 867 tackle Advanced Cryptics ; higher levels of H ( 35 . 9 % , z = 2 . 4 , p < . 05 ) and lower levels of S ( 16 . 8 % , z = - 868 2 . 7 , p < . 01 ) whose main target for enjoyment was the smooth clueing ; and higher levels of S ( 30 . 2 % , 869 z = 2 . 7 , p < . 01 ) and lower levels of H ( 13 . 5 % , z = - 2 . 4 , p < . 05 ) whose primary focus was the endgame . 870 871 Speed - solving and challenge 872 Solvers were also asked whether they would be disappointed if they solved a crossword rapidly 873 ( Table 2 ( C ) ) . Although chi - square showed a significant association overall ( χ2 ( 4 ) = 9 . 99 , p = . 041 , 874 Cramer’s V = . 079 [ . 050 , . 139 ] ) , inspection of the standardized residuals revealed no stand - out 875 elements . As expected , S solvers ( among whom were a number of competition - focused ‘Speed 876 Solvers’ - see Friedlander & Fine , 2009 ) would be least troubled by a rapid solve ( ’No : I enjoy speed - 877 solving’ : 12 . 7 % ; O 9 . 9 % , z = - 1 . 6 ; H 14 . 3 % , z = 0 . 7 ; S 16 . 9 % , z = 1 . 6 ) , but , even for this group , numbers 878 were low , and standardized residuals were non - significant . Nearly half the solvers indicated that 879 they would be disappointed without a good challenge to wrestle with , and although there was some 880 variation across the expertise groups ( 48 . 0 % ; O 48 . 4 % , z = 0 . 1 ; H 52 . 0 % , z = 0 . 9 ; S 42 . 1 % , z = - 1 . 1 ) 881 inspection of the standardized residuals were once again non - significant . 882 883 Indeed , when asked whether they might switch newspapers if the crossword challenge became 884 routinely easy ( Table 2 ( D ) ) , nearly 70 % of solvers indicated that they would consider this ( 69 . 7 % ; O 885 70 . 1 % ; H 71 . 7 % ; S 66 . 3 % ) , with differences between the groups being statistically non - significant . 886 887 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 27 Potential contribution of cryptic crosswords to insight research 888 The above review suggests that the cryptic crossword domain could prove a useful addition to the 889 repository of insight problem paradigms . That they are capable of triggering insight on a regular 890 basis is quite clear : survey results reported above indicate that cryptic crossword solvers were 891 primarily motivated to solve cryptics because of the ‘Aha ! ’ or ‘Penny - Drop’ moment , and also 892 reported that the ‘laugh - out - loud’ moment at the point of solving the clues was highly enjoyable . 893 Furthermore , the detailed review of cryptic clues set out above demonstrates that they use a broad 894 variety of insight - triggering mechanisms shared in common with a wide range of other insight 895 problem formats . A single cryptic crossword puzzle thus presents a unique compendium of 896 heterogeneous challenges which sets it apart from all other methodologies currently available ; and 897 this should facilitate the comparison of outcomes between device types within the crossword itself , 898 as well as with other insight puzzle challenges external to the crossword . 899 900 One small caveat is that cryptic crosswords are primarily restricted to a number of English language 901 speaking countries , although a few cryptic type puzzles do exist in Dutch and German . This may 902 reduce the flexibility of cryptic crosswords as an insight puzzle paradigm . Straight - definition 903 crosswords are , of course , available in all languages , but lack the cryptic elements described in detail 904 in this paper which set this puzzle form apart and trigger the insight moment . 905 906 Cryptic crossword clues thus reliably trigger insight experiences , but ( as for all insight puzzles ) this is 907 not exclusively the case . In cryptic crossword trials filmed for transcription using Verbal Protocol 908 Analysis ( VPA ) , casual inspection of the recordings suggests that not every clue produces as many 909 PDMs ; and not every solver follows the same path to solution . Systematic analysis of the video 910 recordings ( on which see further Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ) will allow us to take full advantage of the 911 think - aloud protocol to capture a wide range of strategically important factors such as intuitive vs . 912 analytical approaches to clue solution ; the length of time spent in impasse on each clue before 913 moving onto another ; the frequency of return to an obstinately resistant item ; perseveration with an 914 incorrect solution pathway ; the antecedents of “Aha ! ” solution moments ; the use of cross - checking 915 letters as opportunistic solution prompts ; the suppression of the surface meaning on initial reading ; 916 the certainty of correctness ( without double - checking ) on solution ; and the use of jottings such as 917 candidate anagram letters ( see Box 5 above ) to facilitate solution ( on the use of VPA in the GECA 918 methodological approach , see further Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ) . These aspects are all highly relevant 919 to the discussion of insight problem solving across a wide range of problem domains . 920 921 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 28 As a precursor to the analysis , the clues used in the crossword trials will be individually analyzed to 922 identify salient features , such as the mechanisms employed , the level and number of the constraints 923 preventing solution , and the predicted difficulty which flows from this ( following e . g . Knoblich , et al . , 924 1999 ; MacGregor & Cunningham , 2009 ; Cunningham , et al . , 2009 ) . It is very possible that the clues 925 vary in difficulty on a principled basis , and if so , this might lead to a better understanding of what 926 makes a cryptic crossword clue enjoyable , and more likely to trigger insight , to lead to impasse , or to 927 invoke ‘Immediate Insight’ solutions . Given the cross - over between cryptic crossword clue types and 928 other insight puzzles , this should shed helpful light on insight mechanisms in other areas , too . 929 930 Logistically , cryptic crosswords also offer a number of advantages over other puzzle types . In the first 931 place , there is no lack of material : cryptic crosswords appear daily in all of the British newspapers , 932 and widely across the world in countries with historically strong connections to Britain ( e . g . Canada , 933 Ireland , Australia , New Zealand , India , and Malta : Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ) . It is thus entirely 934 possible to commission a professionally composed , high - quality puzzle specifically for a research 935 study thus guaranteeing that all participants will be naïve to the challenge . Clue solution rates are 936 high , too : in trials involving 28 solvers ( both expert and non - expert ) tackling a commissioned 27 - clue 937 crossword of medium difficulty , 682 of the 756 clues ( 90 . 2 % ) were solved correctly within the 45 938 minute time limit ( Fine & Friedlander , in preparation ) . Solving times for those who finished the 939 entire puzzle ( n = 19 ) could be very rapid indeed ( range solving times : 10m47s - 40m30s ; mean 940 solving time for finishers 23m : 43s , median 22m15s ) resulting in solutions occurring , on average , 941 approximately once a minute ( Fine & Friedlander , in preparation ) . 942 943 Fast solvers in this trial were all highly expert in the field ( Fine & Friedlander , in preparation ) , and the 944 survey results set out above also indicate that experts may approach the solving of cryptic clues in 945 subtly different ways to less expert solvers of equivalent experience . What could be seen as a 946 disadvantage for this methodology ( that cryptic crossword solving is a niche activity requiring inside 947 knowledge of and experience with the clue mechanisms ) thus becomes a compelling strength : there 948 is much that might be gained from studying expert insight puzzle solvers at work , and this is 949 currently impossible in other insight domains ( such as RAT puzzles or matchstick math ) which , by 950 necessity , always use naïve populations . 951 952 Lamenting the lack of expertise studies in the insight area , Batchelder and Alexander ( 2012 ) even 953 suggested artificially training groups of individuals to produce ‘expert’ solvers of such problems , 954 commenting that experts “might have the capacity to rapidly shift their search spaces until the type 955 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 29 of space that contains the solution occurs to them” ( Batchelder & Alexander , 2012 , p . 88 ) . However , 956 this proposal overlooks the potential role of individual differences : MacGregor and Cunningham 957 argue that there may be reliable variations in the ability of individual subjects to solve insight 958 problems ( 2008 ; see also DeYoung , et al . , 2008 ; Ovington , et al . , 2016 ) which may undermine the 959 ecological validity of training ‘experts’ from a randomly selected sample of individuals . Within the 960 crossword field we found naturally - occurring expertise groupings - all with equivalent levels of 961 experience over many decades in the field , but with quite different expertise outcomes ( Friedlander 962 & Fine , 2016 ) - and this presents a unique opportunity for exploration . 963 964 The cryptic crossword survey data set out in Tables 1 and 2 above hints at some interesting 965 differences between the various expertise groups and their approach to solving this form of puzzle . 966 Most intriguing of all is the possibility that experts have an enhanced capacity to resist the red - 967 herring set for them , by electively divorcing the reading of the clue from its surface meaning ( ’the 968 surface meaning could be gobbledygook’ ) , and thus shielding the mind from the deliberate 969 misdirection . Whether expert solvers therefore experience the full phenomenological experience of 970 the ‘Aha ! ’ moment upon solution of the clue is thus an interesting angle for further investigation : 971 experts claim to be equally motivated by the promise of the ‘Aha ! ’ moment ( Table 1 ) , yet , 972 paradoxically , appear to suppress that very need for Representational Change which might have 973 been considered fundamental to the insight experience . Experts also solve more rapidly , with speed 974 prowess being a primary focus for some ( Friedlander & Fine , 2009 ) , and this affords an opportunity 975 to explore rapid ‘pop - out’ solutions and the relevance of ‘Immediate Insight’ to the exploration of 976 the ‘Aha ! ’ moment . 977 978 It is also notable that significantly more ‘Super - Experts’ engage in Advanced Cryptic puzzles than 979 either High Expert or Ordinary solvers , and that their primary focus in doing so is significantly more 980 often linked , not with the appreciation of the smooth misdirection of the clueing itself , but with the 981 complexity , novelty and lateral thinking challenge of the Advanced Cryptic endgame , which is more 982 akin to the ‘classic’ insight puzzle format in its use of thematic or spatial features . This again affords 983 opportunities to examine the multi - dimensional nature of the demands posed by different insight 984 problem types , as described in the body of this article , and the interplay with individual differences 985 shown by problem solvers , in terms of their thinking and personality styles . 986 987 Conclusion 988 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 30 In sum , this preliminary review suggests that cryptic crossword puzzles may be a promising source of 989 insight problems offering a number of potential advantages over some of the puzzles and riddles 990 previously used : for example , they are readily obtainable in potentially unlimited supply , solvable 991 within acceptable time limits and suited to the simultaneous exploration of a variety of puzzle types 992 and their potentially distinct solving mechanisms . Uniquely among existing paradigms , they also 993 afford us the opportunity to study insight - solving expertise in action and to identify the 994 characteristics and methodological approaches of those with a particular propensity to solve these 995 puzzles effectively . There is therefore much to explore , and the discussion above suggests a number 996 of particularly interesting avenues which we are currently pursuing . We believe that this new 997 paradigm may prove to be a useful source of theoretically and empirically grounded , heterogeneous 998 insight challenges ; and that it is well - placed to shed a unique light on the workings of this elusive and 999 intriguing aspect of human cognition . 1000 1001 1002 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 31 1003 Table 1 : Responses by expertise category to questions about ‘insight’ properties of crossword 1004 clues 1005 1006 O H S All Groups ( A ) Top responses to ' Crossword Motivation ' question ( Mean scores , out of 5 ) Number of responses to question 388 221 177 786 1 .

Clue 1 ( b ) Grown - up kid starts to gossip on aunt’s Twitter ( 4 ) The definition is ‘Grown - up kid’ = a misleading circumlocution for GOAT The wordplay plays on the word ‘starts’ ( in the nounal sense of ‘leading letters’ , not verbal sense of ‘begins’ ) as an acrostic indicator : ‘Gossip On Aunt’s Twitter’ . Clue 1 ( c ) Scrub the cooker top and clean out ( 6 ) - ( Cleary , 1996 , from the Guardian , No . 20248 , 26 Jan 1995 ) The definition is ‘Scrub’ = CANCEL , a non - prototypical interpretation . The wordplay is a complex anagram of ‘C’ ( = ‘the cooker top’ i . e . its initial letter ) + CLEAN . The anagram indicator is the word ‘OUT’ . An important secondary function of the wordplay is to guide the solver away from the required definition of the target word , and to strongly promote the more prototypical sense ‘Scrub = Clean’ by contextual means ( Cleary , 1996 ) . Wordplay elements ( Friedlander & Fine , 2016 ) The algebraic / programming nature of the cryptic clue means that wordplay components may be flexibly recombined or anagrammed to form new units , e . g . : ● A + B = C ( FAT + HER = FATHER ) ● rev ( A ) = B ( TRAMS - > SMART ) ● anag ( A + B ) = C ( CAT + HAT = ATTACH ) ● trunc ( A ) = B ( CUTTER - > UTTER ) I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 33 Clues usually contain an ‘indicator’ identifying what type of transformation is required ( Biddlecombe , 2009 ) , but equally might be of a punning / novelty type ( usually indicated by a question mark at the end of the clue ) . 1021 1022 BOX 2 | Illustration of cryptic clue mechanisms : jokes and puns Clue 2 ( a ) Frightened to death ? ( 6 , 5 ) - ( Cleary , 1996 ) Answer = SCARED STIFF , with a punning reference to ‘STIFF’ = ‘corpse’ , confirming the correctness of the solution . Clue 2 ( b ) Discovered why electrical equipment was dangerous ? ( 9 ) - ( Collingridge , 2010 ) Answer = UNEARTHED ( the latent secondary sense relates to electrical wiring ) Clue 2 ( c ) Yorkshire beauty queen , we hear , pulls the wool over one ' s eyes ( 8 ) ( ’Orlando’ , in Connor , 2011b ) Answer = MISLEADS . The pun ( ’Miss Leeds’ ) is indicated by a homophone indicator ‘we hear’ , common in joke - style clues . Clue 2 ( d ) A wicked thing ? ( 6 ) - ( Aarons , 2015 ) Answer = CANDLE . The clue relies on the two different homographic senses of the word ‘wicked’ . Difficulty is heightened by the distinctly different pronunciation ( / wik’id / ; / wikt / ) and by the non - prototypical sense of ‘wicked’ which is required ( = ‘possessing a wick’ ) . As in most punning or riddle - style clues , the quirky or nonsensical nature of the answer is flagged by the use of a question mark , which serves as a clue - type indicator . 1023 1024 BOX 3 | Rebus puzzles 3 ( a ) poPPd ( MacGregor & Cunningham , 2008 ) Solution : ‘Two peas in a pod” : auditory pun on ‘P’ = ‘pea’ , together with spatial location of the letters inside the word ‘pod’ . 3 ( b ) TIMING TIM ING ( Smith & Blankenship , 1989 ) Solution : ‘Split second timing’ : the second instance of ‘timing’ is split into two parts . 3 ( c ) M CE / M CE / M CE ( Salvi , Costantini , et al . , 2016 ) Solution : ‘Three Blind Mice’ : the mice have no ‘I’s ( eyes ) 3 ( d ) R . P . I . ( MacGregor & Cunningham , 2009 ) Solution : ‘A grave error’ ( it should have been written as R . I . P . ) 1025 1026 1027 BOX 4 | Illustration of cryptic clue mechanisms : rebus - like components Clue 4 ( a ) : Player with only one leg ? ( 4 ) ( Guardian Crossword No . 25351 , by Tramp ; 17 June 2011 ) Answer = IPOD , a type of music player . I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 34 The clue works by comic analogy to ‘TRIPOD’ , with the letter ‘I’ standing in for the numeral ‘one’ . This is very similar to the rebus puzzle at Box 3 ( a ) . Clue 4 ( b ) : Must’ve ? ( 5 , 7 , 2 , 3 , 3 ) ( Guardian Crossword No . 25351 , by Tramp ; 17 June 2011 ) Answer = THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX . Wordplay : MUSE [ think ] outside of TV [ ‘the box’ ] - a rebus - like construction , also telling the solver what he must literally do to solve the clue . The punctuation is a highly distracting feature . Clue 4 ( c ) : Part of it ’it an iceberg ( 7 ) - ( Moorey , 2009 ) Answer = TITANIC . Wordplay : substring ( A + B + C + D ) leading to a hidden word , indicated by the instruction ‘Part of’ . The Titanic did indeed hit an iceberg , making this an ‘ & Lit’ ( or ‘all - in - one’ ) clue : the clue as a whole functions as both the definition and the wordplay ( Manley , 2014 ; Aarons , 2015 ) . Clue 4 ( d ) : GEGS ( 9 , 4 ) - ( A well - known but unattributed clue , see Aarons , 2015 ) Answer = SCRAMBLED EGGS . There is no guidance in the clue : the solver must literally ‘say what they see’ . Compare the rebus examples 3 ( b ) and 3 ( c ) in Box 3 above . Clue 4 ( e ) : H , I , J , K , L , M , N , O ( 5 ) - ( Another old chestnut of uncertain provenance , see Aarons , 2015 ) Answer = WATER . Wordplay : “H to O” , if spoken aloud , sounds like H 2 O . Clue 4 ( f ) : Somewhat swollen condition of female diving bird ? ( 9 ) - Times 24451 , Feb 3rd 2010 Answer = PUFFINESS = ‘Somewhat swollen condition’ Wordplay = a quirky charade of PUFFIN + ‘ - ESS’ suffix , often indicative of a female in an animal species ( e . g . ‘lioness’ ) . 1028 1029 BOX 5 | Cryptic Crosswords - Anagram clues 5 ( a ) Tube taken to theatre for three - act play ( 8 ) ( Aarons , 2015 p . 371 ) ANSWER = CATHETER ( = ’Tube taken to theatre’ ) . Letter fodder = THREE - ACT ; anagram indicator = ‘PLAY’ . There is heavy misdirection drawing the solver away from the required medical context and into theatrical performance and the ‘London Underground’ ( the ‘Tube’ ) . 5 ( b ) Doctor Watson ' s kit - or bits of modern office furniture ( 12 ) ( Biddlecombe , 2009 ) ANSWER = WORKSTATIONS ( ’bits of modern office furniture’ ) Letter fodder = WATSON’S KIT OR ; anagram - indicator = ‘Doctor’ Misleading disguise of anagram indicator in the name ‘Doctor Watson’ , making the parsing of the clue unclear . 5 ( c ) Find rare new frequencies beyond the visible range ( 8 ) ( Johnstone , 2001 , p . 70 ) ANSWER = INFRARED ( ’frequencies beyond the visible range’ ) Letter fodder = FIND RARE ; anagram indicator = NEW Johnstone points out that solvers often write out candidate letters as shown below , in order to facilitate the solving process : I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 35 1030 1031 BOX 6 | Illustration of cryptic ‘double definition’ clues : RAT - like mechanism Clue 6 ( a ) : Tea shop ( 5 ) ( Biddlecombe , 2009 , attributed to Azed ) Answer = GRASS . Synonym 1 : ‘Tea’ = slang for ‘marijuana’ = GRASS Synonym 2 : ‘Shop’ = slang for ‘betray to the police’ = GRASS . ‘Shop’ has to be taken as a verb in this meaning , in contrast to the nounal function in the clue itself . Clue 6 ( b ) : Savings book ( 7 ) ( Aarons , 2015 , p . 365 ) Answer = RESERVE . Synonym 1 : ‘Savings’ = a RESERVE of money Synonym 2 : ‘book’ = to RESERVE ( a table etc . ) : again verbal ( solution ) rather than nounal ( clue ) Clue 6 ( c ) : Quits flat ( 4 ) ( Connor , 2011a , by Rufus ) Answer = EVEN Synonym 1 : ‘Quits’ = ‘neither owing , nor owed’ = EVEN : adjective , not verb Synonym 2 : ‘Flat’ = ‘level’ = EVEN : adjective , not noun Clue 6 ( d ) : Left red wine in harbour ( 4 ) . ( Biddlecombe , 2009 ; Aarons , 2015 p . 366 ) Answer = PORT , a triple - definition Synonym 1 : ‘Left’ = ‘on PORT side’ : adjective , not verb Synonym 2 : ‘Red wine’ = fortified PORT wine Synonym 3 : ‘Harbour’ = PORT Clue 6 ( e ) Soldier even fixed uniform ( 7 ) - Daily Telegraph 28392 Answer = REGULAR , a quadruple definition with a misleading military surface reading Synonym 1 : ‘Soldier’ = REGULAR ( i . e . member of permanent forces ) Synonym 2 : ‘even’ = ‘level’ = REGULAR ( adjective , not adverb ) Synonym 3 : ‘fixed’ = ‘at set intervals’ = REGULAR ( adjective , not verb ) Synonym 4 : ‘uniform’ = ‘unvarying’ = REGULAR ( adjective , not noun ) 1032 1033 I n r e v i e w Aha moment Insight and Crosswords 36 1034 References 1035 1036 Aarons , D .
