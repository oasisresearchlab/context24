We ana - lyzed the DREB2A promoter and found a heat shock ele - ment that functions as a cis - acting element in the heat shock ( HS ) - responsive expression of DREB2A . Among the 21 Arabidopsis heat shock factors , we chose 4 HsfA1 - type proteins as candidate transcriptional activators ( HsfA1a , HsfA1b , HsfA1d , and HsfA1e ) based on transactivation activity and expression patterns . We generated multiple mutants and found that the HS - responsive expression of DREB2A disappeared in hsfa1a / b / d triple and hsfa1a / b / d / e quadruple mutants . Moreover , HS - responsive gene expres - sion , including that of molecular chaperones and transcrip - tion factors , was globally and drastically impaired in the hsfa1a / b / d triple mutant , which exhibited greatly reduced tolerance to HS stress . HsfA1 protein accumulation in the nucleus was negatively regulated by their interactions with HSP90 , and other factors potentially strongly activate the HsfA1 proteins under HS stress . The hsfa1a / b / d / e quadru - ple mutant showed severe growth retardation , and many genes were downregulated in this mutant even under non - stress conditions . Our study indicates that HsfA1a , HsfA1b , and HsfA1d function as main positive regulators in HS - responsive gene expression and four HsfA1 - type proteins are important in gene expression for normal plant growth .

Many genes are induced under heat shock ( HS ) stress and work together to increase thermotolerance . The accumulation of heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) is assumed to play a central role in the HS response . Heat shock transcription factors ( HSFs ) regulate the expression of many HS - inducible genes , including HSPs ( Kotak et al . 2007a ; Åkerfelt et al . 2010 ) . Animals and yeasts have from one to several HSF genes , whereas plants have many HSFs that are divided into three classes ( A , B , and C ) according to the structural features of their oligomerization domains . Class A HSFs have an acidic motif at the C - terminus and function as transcrip - tional activators , whereas class B HSFs have a repression domain and act as transcriptional repressors ( Kotak et al . 2007a ; von Koskull - Döring et al . 2007 ; Ikeda and Ohme - Takagi 2009 ; Åkerfelt et al . 2010 ) . HSFs bind heat shock response elements ( HSEs ) with the core sequence nGAAnnTTCn or nTTCnnGAAn and form trimers , thereby regulating downstream gene expression ( Wu 1995 ) . Many HSFs have been characterized in various plants and shown to form complex regulatory networks . This complex regulation of gene expression is thought to be important to allow X exible responses of plants , not only to HS stress , but also to other environmental conditions and developmental events . There are 21 HSFs in Arabidopsis , and several functions as upstream regulators of the HS response . HsfA1a and HsfA1b have roles in the immediate HS - responsive gene expression ( Lohmann et al . 2004 ; Busch et al . 2005 ) , and HsfA2 is essential for extending the duration of thermotolerance ( Nishizawa et al . 2006 ; Charng et al . 2007 ) . HsfA3 also plays a role in thermotolerance and its expression is regulated by DEHYDRATION - RESPON - SIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN 2A ( DREB2A ) ( Schramm et al . 2008 ; Yoshida et al . 2008 ) . HsfA4a is hypothesized to function as sensors of reactive oxygen spe - cies ( ROS ) ( Davletova et al . 2005 ) , and HsfA5 has been reported to function as a speci W c repressor of HsfA4 ( Baniwal et al . 2007 ) . Moreover , HsfA9 has been shown to function as a master regulator of HSP gene expression during seed development ( Kotak et al . 2007b ) . In Arabidopsis , DREB2A is one of the transcription fac - tors that activates the expression of drought - responsive and / or HS - responsive genes ( Yamaguchi - Shinozaki and Shinozaki 2006 ; Sakuma et al . 2006a ) . DREB2A has a con - served ERF / AP2 DNA - binding domain and recognizes a dehydration - responsive element ( DRE ) . This DRE was W rst identi W ed as a cis - acting promoter element that regulates gene expression in response to drought , salt , and cold stresses in Arabidopsis and it was recently reported to func - tion as an HS - responsive element ( Sakuma et al . 2006b ) . Although DREB2A activates the expression of many stress - responsive genes , its expression is also strongly induced by various stresses . DREB2A expression is induced rapidly and transiently by HS treatment , whereas it is induced gradually by drought stress ( Sakuma et al . 2006b ) . Here , we analyzed the regulation of DREB2A expression under HS stress and found that an HSE in the promoter region functions as a positive regulatory element for HS - inducible expression of DREB2A . We assessed the transac - tivation activity of all 21 HSF transcription factors in Ara - bidopsis cells and then focused on HsfA1 proteins . We characterized the HsfA1 genes in plants and demonstrated the roles for HsfA1 proteins in the expression of HS - induc - ible genes under both HS stress and non - stress conditions . Materials and methods Plant materials , growth conditions and stress treatments Arabidopsis plants ( Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia and Wassilewskija ) were grown on germination medium ( GM ) agar plates at 22°C for 9 – 14 days as described previ - ously ( Sakuma et al . 2006b ) . They were subsequently trans - ferred into vermiculite and grown under a 16 - h light / 8 - h dark regime . The hsfA1a / b double knockout mutant was iso - lated in a previous study ( Lohmann et al . 2004 ) . T - DNA insertion lines of hsfa1d - 1 ( SAIL _ 410 _ E01 ) , hsfa1d - 2 ( SALK _ 022404 ) , and hsfs1e ( SALK _ 094943 ) mutants were obtained from Arabidopsis Biological Resource Cen - ter ( ABRC ) . For stress treatments , Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on agar plates at 22°C for 2 weeks until they produced around six true leaves . As an HS treatment , the agar plates were transferred to 37°C . For drought stress treatment , the seedlings were removed from the agar plates and placed on Para W lm ( Pechiney Plastic Packaging ) at 22°C , when the seedlings had lost 30 , 50 and 70 % of their weight within 1 , 2 and 5 h , respectively . For geldanamycin ( GDA ) treatment , 2 - week - old seedlings were removed from agar plates and dipped in 50 (cid:2) M GDA ( Sigma ) . Ther - motolerance tests were performed as described in Sakuma et al . ( 2006b ) . Arabidopsis seeds were germinated and grown on W lter papers containing 4 mL of liquid GM in 90 - mm plastic Petri dishes at 22°C . Nine - day - old seedlings were treated for 45 min at 45°C in a hybridization oven ( HB - 80 , TAITEC , Saitama , Japan ) . After HS treatment , Mol Genet Genomics ( 2011 ) 286 : 321 – 332 323 123 plants were allowed to recover for 4 days at 22°C . Plants that were still producing new leaves were scored as surviving . Plant transformation Various lengths of DREB2A promoters were ampli W ed from Columbia using a high - W delity PCR and inserted in front of the (cid:2) - glucuronidase ( GUS ) gene by Bam HI or Eco RV sites in a pGK - GUS vector ( Hellens et al . 2000 ; Qin et al . 2008 ) . 35S : sGFP – HsfA1 plasmids were created by the insertion of each HsfA1 coding sequence into pGK - NsGFP by Not I - Xho I sites ( Qin et al . 2008 ) . The constructed plas - mids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 cells . Plants were transformed as described previously ( Sakuma et al . 2006b ) . Microarray analysis and quantitative real - time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) Total RNA was isolated with RNAiso reagent ( Takara ) from 14 - day - old seedlings of the hsfA1a / b / d triple and hsfA1a / b / d / e quadruple mutant , and WT plants , which were grown on GM agar plates with or without stress treatments at 37°C for 1 h . Genome - wide transcriptome analysis using the Arabidopsis 3 Oligo Microarray Kit ( Agilent Technolo - gies , http : / / www . home . agilent . com / agilent / home . jspx ) was conducted with total RNA as described previously ( Qin et al . 2008 ) . For each biological replicate , material from three plants was pooled to make a single sample for RNA puri W cation . Two independent RNA samples were used for each experiment . The reproducibility of the microarray analysis was veri W ed by a dye swap in each experiment . To search for cis - acting elements in promoters , 1 - kb upstream sequences were retrieved from the Arabidopsis Information Resource . Heat maps were constructed with the top 100 downregulated genes in each experiment , and stimuli responsiveness of each gene was derived from Genevesti - gator stimulus data sets ( www . genevestigator . ethz . ch ) . The qRT - PCR analyses were carried out with total RNA using an ABI 7500 real - time PCR system as described previously ( Qin et al . 2008 ) . The primers used in this work are listed in Table S1 . All microarray design and data have been depos - ited in the ArrayExpress database , www . ebi . ac . uk / arrayex - press ( Accession no . E - MEXP - 2870 , E - MEXP - 2873 and E - MEXP - 3030 ) . Transient expression assay Transient expression assays using protoplasts derived from Arabidopsis mesophyll tissue were performed as described previously ( Yoo et al . 2007 ) . The HSEx3 - GUS reporter plasmid was cotransfected with each e V ector plasmid . The pBI35S (cid:3) - LUC reporter plasmid ( Yoshida et al . 2010 ) was used as an internal control in the transactivation experi - ments . Transfection of protoplasts and luciferase ( LUC ) and GUS reporter assays were conducted as described pre - viously ( Kidokoro et al . 2009 ) . Fluorescence observation Bimolecular X uorescence complementation ( BiFC ) assays were performed as described previously ( Walter et al . 2004 ) . All coding sequences of HsfA1 and HSP90 genes were cloned into pUCSPYNE or pUCSPYCE vectors by Xba I - Xho I sites . Transient expression in onion epidermal cells or Arabidopsis mesophyll cells was performed as described previously ( Yoo et al . 2007 ; Qin et al . 2008 ) . Green X uorescent protein ( GFP ) and yellow X uorescent protein ( YFP ) X uorescence signals were analyzed with a confocal laser - scanning microscope ( LSM5 , Zeiss ) . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assays For ChIP experiments , 14 - day - old plants grown on MS media were treated for 1 h at 37°C in an air incubator . ChIP assays were performed as described previously ( Kim et al . 2008 ) with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against GFP ( Abcam ; ab290 ) . PCR was performed in a total volume of 25 (cid:2) L using 1 - ng template DNA . PCR products were sepa - rated by PAGE on a 10 % acrylamide : bis - acrylamide ( 19 : 1 ) TBE gel and stained with SYBR Gold ( Life Technologies ) . The signals were detected using Fluor Imager SI ( GE Healthcare ) . Relative values were evaluated with input DNA and compared with the binding enrichment on HSP18 . 2 gene regions as a positive control . PCR primers used in this study are listed in Table S1 . Accession numbers The complete set of microarray data has been deposited in the EBI ArrayExpress database ( www . ebi . ac . uk / arrayex - press / ; accession no .

Results Analyses of cis - and trans - acting factors in DREB2A expression To determine possible cis - elements controlling DREB2A expression under HS stress , we generated transgenic plants harboring a GUS reporter gene fused to various lengths of the DREB2A promoter ( Fig . 1a ) and performed qRT - PCR to investigate GUS expression during HS stress in transgenic 324 Mol Genet Genomics ( 2011 ) 286 : 321 – 332 123 plants . GUS expression was undetectable in N8 , N9 , C1 , C2 , C3 , and C4 plants with the promoter truncated between ¡ 147 and ¡ 161 , the region containing the HSE ( TTCn - nGAAnnTTC ) sequence ( Fig . 1b ) . This HSE may be important for DREB2A expression under HS stress . To examine the transactivation activity of HSFs via the HSE in the DREB2A promoter , we performed a transient transactivation assay using Arabidopsis protoplasts . We used 21 HSF genes driven by the 35S promoter as e V ector plasmids and the three tandem repeats of the 55 - bp HSE - containing region of the DREB2A promoter fused to the GUS gene as a reporter plasmid ( Fig . 1c ) . Co - expression of HsfA1a , HsfA1b , HsfA1d , HsfA1e , HsfA2 , HsfA3 , and HsfA6b resulted in reporter gene activity more than W vefold higher than that of the vector control . According to public databases such as GENEVESTIGATOR ( Zimmermann et al . 2004 ) , the HsfA1a , HsfA1b , and HsfA1d genes are constitutively expressed . Expression levels of the HsfA2 and HsfA3 genes are highly upregulated by HS , and those of HsfA1e and HsfA6b are very low ( Fig . S1 ) . Since previ - ous studies reported that the overexpression of HsfA2 and HsfA3 did not a V ect DREB2A expression ( Nishizawa et al . 2006 ; Yoshida et al . 2008 ) , we hypothesized that these genes may not function in the regulation of DREB2A expression . Among the remaining candidates , some HsfA1 s showed strong transactivation activity . Thus , we focused on HsfA1 - type genes , namely HsfA1a , HsfA1b , HsfA1d , and HsfA1e . We analyzed the expression of the HsfA1 and DREB2A genes under non - stress and HS conditions using qRT - PCR ( Fig . 1d ) . All of these genes were expressed at higher levels in shoots than in roots under HS and non - stress conditions , but the HsfA1e gene was expressed only at low levels under non - stress conditions . Analysis of DREB2A expression in hsfa1 knockout mutants To analyze whether HsfA1 proteins mediate the induction of the DREB2A gene under HS stress , we analyzed single and multiple knockout mutants . hsfa1a / d and hsfa1b / d dou - ble mutants and hsfa1a / b / d triple mutants were generated by crossing hsfa1d - 1 and hsfa1a / b T - DNA insertion Fig . 1 Analyses of cis - and trans - acting factors in the expression of DREB2A . a We generated transgenic plants ( designated as FL , N1 » 9 , and C1 » 6 ) harboring reporter genes containing various lengths of the DREB2A promoter . Diagrams of reporter genes are shown on the left . Induction of GUS mRNA under HS stress was analyzed in transgenic plants by qRT - PCR ( expression level at 0 h was set to 1 ) . Data represent the mean and SD of more than three independent lines . b Sequences contained between ¡ 183 and ¡ 129 of the DREB2A pro - moter are shown .

Scheme of e V ector and reporter plasmids for the transient assay is shown in the internal box . Coding sequences for the 21 Arabidopsis HSFs indicated on the left axis were used for the e V ec - tor plasmids , and the sequence indicated in Fig . 1b was used for the reporter plasmid . A 35S : LUC plasmid was cotransfected in each exper - iment to normalize for transfection e Y ciency .

Bars indicate SD ( n = 3 ) . d A qRT - PCR analyses of expression levels of HsfA1 genes ( left column ) and DREB2A ( right col - umn ) . Total RNA was prepared from 2 - week - old Col plants heated to 37°C . The HsfA1d expression level of shoot at 1 h was set to 100 . Bars indicate SD ( n = 3 ) (cid:2) Mol Genet Genomics ( 2011 ) 286 : 321 – 332 325 123 mutants ( Lohmann et al . 2004 ) . We crossed hsfa1a / b / d and hsfa1e mutants to obtain hsfa1b / d / e triple and hsfa1a / b / d / e quadruple mutants . RT - PCR analysis con W rmed the absence of HsfA1 gene expression in the mutants ( Fig . 2a ) . Compared with 2 - week - old wild - type ( WT ) seedlings growing on germination medium ( GM ) or on soil , only the hsfa1a / b / d / e quadruple mutant showed growth retardation ( Fig . S2a ) . This phenotype was more obvious when the plants were grown on soil ( Figs . 2b , S2a ) . We then ana - lyzed the expression of the DREB2A gene under HS stress in the mutants . The hsfa1a / b double mutant and the single mutants were di V erent ecotypes—Wassilewskija ( Ws ) and Columbia ( Col ) , respectively . Therefore , we used WT plants of both ecotypes as controls . In addition to multiple mutants , we analyzed the hsfa1d - 2 single mutant because HsfA1d has not been as extensively analyzed as HsfA1a or HsfA1b . Although this allele was not used to generate mul - tiple mutants , the expression patterns of DREB2A in WT , hsfa1d - 1 , and hsfa1d - 2 were similar under the HS stress conditions ( Fig . S2b ) . The induction of the DREB2A gene under HS stress was almost completely eliminated in the hsfa1a / b / d triple and hsfa1a / b / d / e quadruple mutants , whereas it was clearly induced in the other mutants ( Fig . 2c ) . We also checked the expression of HsfA3 , which is a representative downstream gene of DREB2A . We found that the expression was not upregulated in the hsfa1a / b / d triple mutant . This indicates that DREB2A - reg - ulated gene expression potentially does not function in the mutant under HS stress conditions . Furthermore , two inde - pendent transgenic transformants , comprising a 35S : HsfA1b construct in the hsfa1a / b / d mutant , complemented DREB2A expression ( Fig . 2d ) . Thus , we concluded that HS - responsive DREB2A expression is mediated by the HsfA1a , HsfA1b , and HsfA1d transcription factors . Despite the high HsfA1b expression levels in the complemented lines , their DREB2A expression level was similar to that observed in the WT . We also analyzed Columbia back - ground plants overexpressing HsfA1a , HsfA1b , or HsfA1d . DREB2A expression in the transgenic plants was not di V er - ent from that in the WT ( data not shown ) . DREB2A expression is also induced by drought stress . To investigate whether HsfA1s regulate DREB2A expres - sion under drought stress , we examined the mRNA levels of DREB2A and its target gene RD29A under drought con - dition in the hsfa1a / b / d triple mutant . We found that both genes were induced by drought stress , similar to the response in WT plants ( Fig . 2e ) . Therefore , HsfA1s could not mediate drought - responsive DREB2A expression . Microarray and qRT - PCR analyses of the hsfa1 mutants To examine the roles of HsfA1a , HsfA1b , HsfA1d , and HsfA1e in the transcriptional network in response to heat stress and plant growth , we compared the expression pro - W les of 2 - week - old hsfa1a / b / d triple and hsfa1a / b / d / e quadruple mutants with those of WT plants ( Col and Ws ) under both HS and non - stress conditions using the Agilent Arabidopsis 3 Oligo Microarray ( Agilent Tech - nologies , Palo Alto , CA ) covering » 26 , 000 genes . After 1 h of HS treatment , 713 and 992 genes showed reduced expression levels ( > twofold ) in the triple and quadruple mutants , respectively , compared with their respective expression in WT plants ( P value < 0 . 05 ) . Of these , 516 genes were commonly downregulated in these two mutants ( Table S2 ) . Among the 713 and 992 genes , respectively , 579 and 658 were upregulated ( > twofold ) by HS stress in WT plants , and 74 and 81 were upregu - lated ( > twofold ) in transgenic plants overexpressing a constitutive active form of DREB2A ( Sakuma et al . 2006b ; Qin et al . 2008 ) . Among the same 713 and 992 genes , respectively , 467 and 645 harbored HSEs in their 1 - kb promoter regions , and 184 and 268 harbored DRE motifs ( Table S2 ) . Focusing on the top 100 downregu - lated genes , HSE motifs were highly enriched when com - pared with the whole genome . DRE motifs were also enriched in these promoters ( Table S3 ) . HS - responsive expression of most HS - inducible genes , including HsfA2 , HSP101 , HSP90 , HSP70 , and HSP18 , were almost com - pletely eliminated in the triple and quadruple mutants ( Table S2 ) . Further analyses by qRT - PCR con W rmed that the triple and quadruple mutants lacked HS - responsive expression of HsfA2 , HSP18 . 2 , HSP90 . 1 , HSP90 . 3 , HSP70 , and HSP101 ( Fig . 2f , S2c ) . Of the top 100 genes downregulated in the triple and quadruple mutants , 81 were commonly downregulated in both mutants ( Table S2 ) . According to Genevestigator stimulus data sets ( www . genevestigator . ethz . ch ; Zimmer - mann et al . 2004 ) , most of these genes are responsive to HS stress ( Fig . 3a ) . Of the top 100 genes downregulated in the triple mutants , 72 and 71 were included in the top 100 genes upregulated in Col and WS WT plants after 1 h of HS treatment , respectively ( Fig . 3 b ) . Of the top 100 genes downregulated in the triple mutants , 31 were expected to encode molecular chaperones and 12 were expected to encode transcription factors ( Fig . 3c , Table S4 ) . We also used qRT - PCR to analyze the expression of some of the HS - inducible genes that were expected to be downregu - lated in the triple and quadruple mutants , but were not downregulated according to the microarray analysis . All of the analyzed genes were downregulated in the mutants ( Fig . S2d ) . Furthermore , a ChIP assay using 35S : sGFP – HsfA1b and 35S : sGFP – HsfA1d transgenic plants revealed that HsfA1s bind the promoter sequence containing HSE of target genes identi W ed by microarray analysis such as HSP18 . 2 , HsfA2 and DREB2A in plants , and the amounts of promoter - binding HsfA1b and HsfA1d proteins were 326 Mol Genet Genomics ( 2011 ) 286 : 321 – 332 123 clearly increased under HS stress conditions when com - pared with those under non - stress conditions ( Fig . 3d ) . Because the quadruple mutant showed severe growth retardation , we compared the expression pro W les of the 2 - week - old triple and quadruple mutants with the pro W les of WT plants under non - stress conditions . Expression of 310 genes was decreased ( > twofold ) in the quadruple mutant in non - stress conditions , and many of them were HS - inducible genes ( Fig . 3a ; Table S2 ) . Of the downregu - lated genes in the quadruple mutants under non - stress con - ditions , 126 genes were commonly downregulated in the quadruple mutants under HS stress ( Fig . 3b ) . In the triple mutants , the expression of only 21 genes was decreased under non - stress conditions ( Fig . 3a ; Table S2 ) . Among the top 100 genes out of the total of 310 , 16 and 8 genes poten - tially encode molecular chaperones and signal transduc - tion - related proteins , such as protein kinases , respectively ( Fig . 3c ; Tables 1 , S4 ) . Phenotypes of the hsfa1 mutants Many genes related to HS tolerance were downregulated in the hsfa1a / b / d triple mutant ; therefore , we evaluated its thermotolerance . The triple mutant and WT were grown on W lter papers pre - moistened with liquid GM for 9 days at 22°C and then exposed to 45°C for 45 min .

Bars indicate SD ( n = 3 ) Mol Genet Genomics ( 2011 ) 286 : 321 – 332 327 123 mutants survived , whereas 78 % of Col and 85 % of Ws WT plants survived during a subsequent 4 - day recovery period at 22°C ( Fig . 4a ) . We also evaluated the thermotolerance of the hsfa1a / b , hsfa1a / d , and hsfa1b / d double mutants . Only the hsfa1b / d mutant displayed reduced survival under HS conditions ( Fig . 4b ) . These results indicate that the HsfA1a , HsfA1b , and HsfA1d proteins have overlapping functions in thermotolerance . Because the expression pro W le of the quadruple mutant di V ered from those of WT plants , even under non - stress conditions , we observed several growth stages of the mutant plants under non - stress conditions . The growth of the quadruple mutant was retarded at every stage ( Fig . 4c ) . We also observed growth in the other mutant combinations ( Fig . S2a ) . None of these plants showed growth retardation at any stage ( data not shown ) . HsfA1a , HsfA1b , and HsfA1d interact with each other and HSP90 in plant cells The localization of the HsfA1a , HsfA1b , and HsfA1d pro - teins transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells was analyzed using GFP – HsfA1 fusion genes . HsfA1a was localized in the nucleus , whereas the other two proteins were localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm ( Fig . 5a ) . After incubation at 37°C for 30 min , the GFP X uorescence was concentrated in the nucleus . HSFs func - tion as trimeric complexes and an interaction between HsfA1a and HsfA1b has been reported previously ( Li et al . 2010 ) . Therefore , we assessed whether HsfA1d interacts with HsfA1a or HsfA1b using BiFC analysis . All of the combinations yielded YFP X uorescence in the nucleus , whereas the vector control failed to give a YFP signal ( Fig . 5b ) , suggesting that the HsfA1a , HsfA1b , and HsfA1d proteins interact with each other through homotrimer or heterotrimer formation . In human cells , HSP90 negatively regulates HSF1 by forming the HSF1 – HSP90 complex ( Zou et al . 1998 ) . To investigate if this regulation also exists in Arabidopsis , we assessed whether HsfA1 and HSP90 proteins interact with each other using BiFC analysis . We analyzed the localiza - tion of HSP90 . 1 and HSP90 . 3 using GFP fusion proteins . Both proteins are localized in the nucleus and the cyto - plasm with or without HS stress ( Fig . 5c ) . We used Fig . 3 Microarray analysis of hsfa1a / b / d triple mutant and hsfa1a / b / d / e quadruple mutant . a Heat maps indicate the responsiveness of the top 100 genes showing reduced expression levels in hsfa1a / b / d or hsfa1a / b / d / e compared with their respective expression in WT ( Col and Ws ) plants after 1 h of HS treatment or non - stress conditions as determined from GENEVESTIGATOR stimulus data sets ( www . genevestigator . ethz . ch : 12 ) .

Transgenic plants ( 14 days old ) overexpressing HsfA1d – GFP and HsfA1e – GFP fusion proteins were subjected to HS stress conditions ( 37°C for 1 h ) or non - stress conditions , followed by formaldehyde crosslinking and immu - noprecipitation . Immunoprecipitated DNA was ampli W ed by PCR . Equal amounts of input DNA and DNA recovered from immunopre - cipitation with an antibody against GFP ( 35S : sGFP – HsfA1b and 35S : sGFP – HsfA1d ) were included in the analysis (cid:2) 328 Mol Genet Genomics ( 2011 ) 286 : 321 – 332 123 HsfA1a , HsfA1b , and HsfA1d and two HSP90 proteins , HSP90 . 1 and HSP90 . 3 , in our analysis . All of the HsfA1 proteins interacted with the HSP90 proteins ( Fig . 5d ) . We obtained similar results using Arabidopsis protoplasts instead of onion epidermal cells ( Fig . S3a , b ) . Subcellular localization of HsfA1 proteins in transgenic plants and the e V ects of an HSP90 inhibitor To con W rm the subcellular localization of HsfA1 proteins , we generated transgenic plants harboring sGFP – HsfA1 fusion genes driven by the 35S promoter . In the leaf tissues , sGFP – HsfA1a X uorescence was detected in the nucleus , whereas sGFP – HsfA1b and sGFP – HsfA1e X uorescence signals were detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm , and sGFP – HsfA1d X uorescence signals were detected only in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 6a ) . To observe the X uorescence response of transgenic plants under HS stress , we kept the plants at 37°C for 15 min . sGFP – HsfA1a , sGFP – HsfA1b , and sGFP – HsfA1e X uorescence signals accumulated in the nucleus under HS stress and were not detected in the cytoplasm . However , sGFP – HsfA1d X uorescence signals were detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm ( Fig . 6a ) . To investigate whether HSP90 proteins in X uence the localization of HsfA1 proteins , we treated transgenic plants carrying sGFP – HsfA1 with the HSP90 inhibitor GDA . Plants were dipped in 50 (cid:2) M GDA solution for 30 min , and their X uorescent responses were observed . The localization of sGFP – HsfA1 was similar to that under HS stress ( Fig . 6a ) . We also analyzed the e V ect of GDA on the expression of DREB2A ( Fig . 6b ) . When plants dipped in water were exposed to HS stress at 37°C for 1 h , DREB2A expression was induced at more than 120 - fold increase ; however , DREB2A expression was induced at only 6 - fold increase after dipping the plants in GDA solu - tion for 1 h . We generated transgenic plants overexpressing nuclear export signals ( NESs ) - truncated sGFP – HsfA1b ( sGFP – HsfA1b (cid:3) ) and sGFP – HsfA1d ( sGFP – HsfA1d (cid:3) ) under the control of the 35S promoter ( Fig . S4a ) . sGFP – HsfA1b (cid:4) and sGFP – HsfA1d (cid:4) X uorescent responses were detected in the nucleus even under non - stress conditions , similar to Fig . 4 Development and thermotolerance of hsfa1 multiple mutants . a Nine - day - old WT and hsfa1a / b / d seedlings were subjected to 45°C for 45 min . b Nine - day - old WT and hsfa1 double mutant seedlings were subjected to a temperature of 45°C for 45 min .

S4b ) . We analyzed the expression of the DREB2A gene in the transgenic plants under non - stress conditions . Although each HsfA1 was overexpressed in the transgenic lines , the expression of DREB2A was unchanged ( Fig . S4c , d ) . We subsequently analyzed transactivation activity of the sGFP – HsfA1b (cid:4) and sGFP – HsfA1d (cid:4) proteins with the transient transactivation experiment using Arabidopsis protoplasts . We used full - length and NES - truncated sGFP – HsfA1b and sGFP – HsfA1d genes driven by the 35S promoter as e V ector plasmids and the DREB2A promoter fused to the GUS gene as a reporter plasmid ( Fig . S4e ) . Both sGFP – HsfA1b (cid:4) and sGFP – HsfA1d (cid:4) displayed less transactivation activity than full - length sGFP – HsfA1b and sGFP – HsfA1d . However , both truncated proteins activated the reporter genes signi W cantly more , at 40 and 50 times that of vector control , respectively , indicating that transactivation activities remained with the NES - truncated proteins ( Fig . S4e ) . These results suggest that overexpression and nuclear localization of the HsfA1 proteins are not su Y cient to initiate a response to HS stress .

We found that an HSE sequence in the DREB2A promoter region func - tions as a cis - acting element in HS - inducible gene expres - sion ( Fig . 1a ) . The GUS reporter gene driven by this region was transactivated by the HsfA1 transcription factors HsfA1a , HsfA1b , HsfA1d , and HsfA1e in Arabidopsis pro - toplasts ( Fig . 1c ) . Moreover , the HsfA1 proteins showed similar localization patterns ( Fig . 6 ) and complex forma - tions in the nucleus ( Fig . 5 ) . Under HS stress , however , DREB2A induction was almost completely eliminated in hsfa1a / b / d triple mutants ( Fig . 2c ) . It seems that HsfA1e does not contribute to DREB2A expression in plants under HS stress . Thus , we concluded that HsfA1a , HsfA1b , and HsfA1d redundantly regulate the expression of DREB2A in response to HS stress . Our microarray analyses of the hsfa1a / b / d triple and hsfa1a / b / d / e quadruple mutants revealed many genes downstream of the HsfA1 proteins during the response to heat stress , including seven HSF genes and several key fac - tors involved in thermotolerance ( Figs . 2f , S2c ; Table S2 ) . HsfA2 induction was almost completely eliminated in both mutants ( Fig . 2f ) . HsfA2 expression is signi W cantly upregu - lated under heat stress , and HsfA2 directly regulates many stress - related genes such as HSP genes ( Charng et al . 2007 ) . The expression of MBF1C , DGD1 , and BI1 genes was also clearly reduced in the triple mutants . These three genes have been reported to be involved in thermotolerance ( Kotak et al . 2007a ) . Furthermore , the expression of HSP90 . 1 , HSP90 . 2 , HSP90 . 3 , and many molecular chaper - ones was also decreased in both mutants . Almost 90 % of the top 100 genes upregulated in WT plants under HS stress were downregulated in both mutants . Furthermore , HSE motifs were found in the promoter regions of many of these genes , suggesting that under HS conditions these genes that are highly downregulated in the mutants are directly regu - lated by the HsfA1 proteins , which recognize HSE motifs ( Tables S2 , 3 ) . However , some of the genes downregulated in the mutants harbored DRE instead of HSE motifs in their promoter regions and might be regulated by DREB2A , downstream of HsfA1 ( Fig . 7 ; Table S3 ) . We also analyzed the expression of several HS - inducible genes that were not downregulated in the mutants accord - ing to the microarray analysis by using qRT - PCR . All of the analyzed genes , however , were signi W cantly downregu - lated in both hsfa1a / b / d triple and hsfa1a / b / d / e quadruple mutants ( Fig . S2d ) . These results suggest that most HS - inducible genes are regulated by HsfA1a , HsfA1b , and HsfA1d under HS stress conditions . Because of the low levels of HsfA1e expression under non - stress conditions ( Fig . 1d ) , the level of the HsfA1e protein may be insu Y - cient to induce downstream genes in response to HS stress . Moreover , HsfA1e expression was induced by HS stress in vegetative tissues , and this induced expression was down - regulated in the triple mutant ( Fig . S2c ) . While HsfA1e has high homology to the other HsfA1 proteins , its role may di V er . The HsfA1a , HsfA1b , and HsfA1d genes were signi W - cantly expressed in vegetative tissues , and disruption of these three genes eliminated the expression of most HS - inducible genes . This result suggested that these three genes were the main positive regulators of HS - responsive gene expression and function at the initiation of a transcriptional cascade for HS - responsive genes ( Fig . 7 ) . However , the functional details of these genes may be slightly di V erent . For example , the expression of some HSP genes is known to depend on HsfA1a / b ( Busch et al . 2005 ) . These genes are not induced by heat stress in the hsfa1a / b mutant despite the existence of HsfA1d . This indicates that the downstream genes of each HsfA1 are not the same . These Fig . 6 Accumulation of HsfA1 proteins and expression level of DREB2A in response to GDA treatment . a GFP X uorescence ( right side ) and Nomarski microscope images ( left side ) of 35S : sGFP – HsfA1 plants .

Expression level under non - stress conditions was de W ned as 1 . Bars indicate SD ( n = 3 ) Mol Genet Genomics ( 2011 ) 286 : 321 – 332 331 123 di V erences seem to enable Arabidopsis to regulate the di V erent expression patterns of stress - inducible genes by regulating HsfA1 activity . Recently , HsfA1 s have been reported as important components for not only heat stress but also for several abiotic stress responses , such as high salt and osmotic stresses ( Liu et al . 2011 ) . The activity of HsfA1s may therefore be optimized under each stress con - dition . This may allow Arabidopsis to X exibly respond to various stresses . Analysis of the hsfa1a / b / d / e quadruple mutant revealed that the elimination of all HsfA1 proteins caused severe plant growth retardation ( Figs . 2b , 4c , S2a ) . The transcrip - tome in the quadruple mutant drastically di V ered from that of WT under both HS and non - stress conditions ( Fig . 3 , Table S2 ) , suggesting that the transcriptional cascade regu - lated by the HsfA1 proteins is also necessary for normal plant growth under non - stress conditions ( Fig . 7 ) . A low level of HsfA1 expression can maintain normal growth under non - stress conditions , because in the hsfa1a / b / d triple mutant it was su Y cient to allow normal plant growth . Our phylogenetic analysis indicates that HsfA1 - type proteins are conserved throughout the plant kingdom ( Fig . S5 ) , sug - gesting their importance among many plant HSFs . Using BiFC analysis , we found that the HsfA1a , HsfA1b , and HsfA1d proteins interact with each other in all possible combinations in the nucleus , but not in the cyto - plasm ( Fig . 5 ) . In contrast , mutant analyses indicated that a single HsfA1 gene was su Y cient to regulate HS - responsive gene expression and to maintain plant growth under non - stress conditions . In vertebrates , interactions between di V erent HSFs provide distinct functional modes of tran - scriptional regulation ( Åkerfelt et al . 2010 ) . In Arabidopsis , however , the HsfA1 protein seems to redundantly function as heterocomplexes or homocomplexes in the nucleus , under both HS and non - stress conditions . HSP90 . 2 was reported to negatively regulate HS - inducible genes in Arabidopsis ( Yamada et al . 2007 ) . Other negative regulators such as HSP70 and HSBP1 were also reported , but these factors attenuate the HS response ( Åkerfelt et al . 2010 ; Hsu et al . 2010 ) . To ana - lyze the e V ect of HSP90 on HsfA1 proteins , plants were treated with GDA . The localization pattern of each sGFP - fused HsfA1 protein was similar to that under HS stress ( Fig . 6a ) . The expression level of DREB2A , however , did not increase in GDA - treated plants ( Fig . 6b ) . These results indicate that HSP90 proteins are involved in the localization of HsfA1 proteins , and that nuclear localiza - tion of HsfA1 proteins is not su Y cient for their activation . Other factors may be necessary to strongly activate HsfA1 proteins in the nucleus under stress conditions . Analysis using transgenic plants overexpressing sGFP – HsfA1b (cid:4) and sGFP – HsfA1d (cid:4) revealed that these NESs - truncated proteins were localized in the nucleus , but could not increase the expression of the target genes ( Fig . S4b , c , d ) . However , these truncated proteins did show su Y cient transactivation activity in the transient experiment using Arabidopsis protoplasts ( Fig . S4e ) . These results appear to support the idea that factors other than nuclear localiza - tion of the HsfA1 proteins may be necessary for their acti - vation . Multiple post - translational modi W cations of the vertebrate HSF1 protein , such as phosphorylation and sumoylation , are involved in the regulation of HSF1 acti - vation – attenuation cycle ( Åkerfelt et al . 2010 ) . However , these modi W cation sites are not conserved in the Arabid - opsis HsfA1 proteins . A more detailed analysis of the pro - teins that interact with HsfA1 under HS stress and non - stress conditions will provide further insights into the activation mechanisms of HsfA1 proteins during HS response . Fig . 7 Models for transcriptional cascades regulated by HsfA1 pro - teins under non - stress and hs stress conditions . Under non - stress con - ditions , four HsfA1 proteins , HsfA1a , HsfA1b , HsfA1d and HsfA1e , regulate the basal level of expression of many target genes , including HsfA2 and HSPs . These gene products are necessary for normal plant growth . HSP90 proteins regulate the localization of HsfA1 proteins . Under HS stress , HsfA1a , HsfA1b , and HsfA1d are activated and in - duce strong expression of most HS - responsive genes , including some transcription factors such as DREB2A and HsfA2 . These transcription factors then regulate additional target genes in the transcriptional cas - cade . Some genes ( e . g . , HSP90 and HsfB genes ) may play roles in feedback control 332 Mol Genet Genomics ( 2011 ) 286 : 321 – 332 123 Acknowledgments This work was supported by Grant - in - Aid for JSPS Fellows ( 21 . 5337 to T .
