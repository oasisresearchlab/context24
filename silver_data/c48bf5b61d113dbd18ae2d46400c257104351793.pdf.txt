The mechanisms by which many of these components are sorted to their specific 14 locations remain unknown . While some motifs mediating subcellular protein localization have been 15 identified , many membrane proteins and most membrane lipids lack known sorting determinants . A 16 putative mechanism for sorting of membrane components is based on membrane domains known as lipid 17 rafts , which are laterally segregated nanoscopic assemblies of specific lipids and proteins . To assess the 18 role of such domains in the secretory pathway , we applied a robust tool for synchronized secretory protein 19 traffic ( RUSH , Retention Using Selective Hooks ) to protein constructs with defined affinity for raft 20 phases . These constructs consist solely of single - pass transmembrane domains ( TMDs ) and , lacking other 21 sorting determinants , constitute probes for membrane domain - mediated trafficking . We find that while 22 raft affinity can be sufficient for steady - state PM localization , it is not sufficient for rapid exit from the 23 endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , which is instead mediated by a short cytosolic peptide motif . In contrast , we 24 find that Golgi exit kinetics are highly dependent on raft affinity , with raft preferring probes exiting Golgi 25 ~ 2 . 5 - fold faster than probes with minimal raft affinity . We rationalize these observations with a kinetic 26 model of secretory trafficking , wherein Golgi export can be facilitated by protein association with raft 27 domains . These observations support a role for raft - like membrane domains in the secretory pathway and 28 establish an experimental paradigm for dissecting its underlying machinery . 29 30 Introduction 31 Secretory and membrane proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) followed by export 32 of non - ER - resident proteins to the Golgi prior to sorting to their ultimate cellular location ( Lippincott - 33 Schwartz et al . , 2000 ) . Soluble and transmembrane proteins ( TMPs ) require somewhat different 34 mechanisms to exit the ER , but both are dependent on the coat protein complex II ( COPII ) , a multi - protein 35 assembly recruited to the ER membrane to sort cargo and facilitate membrane deformation ( Otte and 36 Barlowe , 2004 ; Sato and Nakano , 2007 ) . Cargo proteins are typically recognized for ER exit by binding 37 2 to COPII subunits via one of several short peptide motifs on their cytoplasmic tails ( Barlowe , 2003a ; 38 Kuehn et al . , 1998 ) . Proteins that lack these motifs can be sorted by binding to motif - containing adaptors 39 ( Castillon et al . , 2011 ; di Ronza et al . , 2018 ) . COPII mediated ER - to - Golgi transport is believed to proceed 40 via vesicles ( Gomez - Navarro et al . , 2020 ; McCaughey and Stephens , 2019 ) ; however , recent observations 41 suggest COPII mediates constrictions in continuous membrane structures connecting ER and Golgi 42 membranes ( Weigel et al . , 2021 ) . 43 The mechanisms and determinants of secretory and membrane protein sorting through the non - contiguous 44 cisternae of the Golgi apparatus are less well understood . Non - resident proteins of the Golgi flux through 45 distinct sub - compartments from cis - to - trans Golgi via several possible non - exclusive paths , including 46 vesicles that exchange between static cisternae and / or dynamic cisternae that themselves change their 47 composition and function over time ( Lujan and Campelo , 2021 ; Pantazopoulou and Glick , 2019 ) . Post - 48 Golgi sorting generally occurs at the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) , where exiting proteins are packaged into 49 transport carriers targeted to other organelles ( Luini et al . , 2008 ; Lujan et al . , 2022 ; Nishimura et al . , 2002 ; 50 Tan and Gleeson , 2019 ) . These sorting steps are at least partially mediated by clathrin ( Ford et al . , 2021 ) 51 and its cargo - binding adapter proteins ( Farias et al . , 2012 ; Nishimura et al . , 2002 ; Park and Guo , 2014 ) . 52 In some cases ( e . g . mannose - 6 - phosphate ) , the principles of sorting are well understood ( Puertollano et 53 al . , 2001 ) . But for many other TMPs , the specific determinants of their subcellular trafficking itineraries 54 and ultimate steady - state location are unknown . Even more mysterious are the rules for lipid sorting 55 between various membranes , though lipid transfer machineries at membrane contact sites are likely 56 important ( Elbaz and Schuldiner , 2011 ; Mesmin et al . , 2013 ; Phillips and Voeltz , 2016 ) . 57 In parallel with polymerizing coats and motif - recognizing adapters , a putative scheme for sorting 58 membrane lipids and proteins relies on nanodomains known as lipid rafts ( Levental et al . , 2020 ; Simons 59 and Ikonen , 1997 ) . Rafts arise due to the intrinsic capacity of biomembranes to laterally separate into 60 coexisting ordered and disordered domains ( Elson et al . , 2010 ) . Though still widely debated , recently 61 accumulating evidence has validated many of the key predictions of the lipid raft hypothesis ( Levental et 62 al . , 2020 ; Sezgin et al . , 2017 ) . One such predictions , indeed the original function for which lipid rafts were 63 proposed , is that rafts facilitate polarized sorting in epithelial cells , assembling lipids and proteins for 64 delivery from the trans - Golgi network to the apical PM ( Lafont et al . , 1999 ; Simons and Ikonen , 1997 ) . 65 Rafts have also been implicated in endocytic sorting ( Gagescu et al . , 2000 ) , with some proteins relying on 66 raft affinity for recycling to the PM after endocytosis ( Diaz - Rohrer et al . , 2023 ; Diaz - Rohrer et al . , 2014b ) . 67 Key evidence supporting the capacity for biomembranes to form raft domains is provided by studies of 68 plasma membranes isolated from living cells as Giant Plasma Membrane Vesicles ( GPMVs ) . Such 69 GPMVs separate into coexisting ordered and disordered phases that laterally sort membrane components 70 according to their preference for certain membrane environments ( Levental and Levental , 2015b ) . 71 Namely , saturated lipids , glycolipids , GPI - anchored proteins , and selected TMPs co - enrich within a 72 relatively tightly packed lipid phase ( termed the “raft phase” ) ( Sezgin et al . , 2012 ) , away from unsaturated 73 phospholipids and most TMPs ( Castello - Serrano et al . , 2020 ; Levental et al . , 2011 ) . GPMVs thus provide 74 a robust tool to quantitatively assess the intrinsic affinity of membrane components for raft - like domains 75 3 in biomembranes . Importantly , the preference of some TMPs for raft domains is tightly correlated with 76 their subcellular localization , with raft association being necessary and sufficient for PM localization 77 ( Diaz - Rohrer et al . , 2014b ) . For these , loss of raft affinity leads to accumulation in endo - lysosomes and 78 ultimate degradation ( Diaz - Rohrer et al . , 2023 ) . 79 While these observations , among many others ( Abrami et al . , 2003 ; Diaz - Rohrer et al . , 2014a ; Fabbri et 80 al . , 2005 ; Glebov et al . , 2006 ; Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) , suggest that lipid - driven microdomains are 81 involved in endocytosis and recycling , the role of rafts in the secretory pathway remains controversial and 82 poorly understood due in large part to methodological limitations . Classical protocols for measuring raft 83 association have been artifact - prone , non - quantitative , and difficult to interpret , while experiments relying 84 on raft disruption are often pleiotropic ( Levental et al . , 2020 ; Munro , 2003 ) . To circumvent these issues 85 and directly interrogate the role of raft association in secretory traffic , we constructed a panel of minimal 86 TMP probes with defined preferences for raft domains and measured their post - ER trafficking itineraries 87 using RUSH , a robust tool for synchronized secretory traffic ( Boncompain et al . , 2012 ) . We observed that 88 raft association is sufficient for the steady - state distribution of some proteins , ER exit kinetics are largely 89 determined by a sorting motif that likely mediates cargo association with COPII machinery . In contrast , 90 raft affinity is sufficient to confer rapid efflux from the Golgi . We rationalize these observations with a 91 kinetic model that generates a quantitative description of temporal transport of secretory cargo as a 92 function of its association with various membrane subdomains . This model reproduces experimental 93 observations and predicts separation of Golgi membranes into coexisting domains . Consistently , we 94 microscopically observe separation of raft from non - raft probes in Golgi compartments and disruption of 95 raft - associated Golgi efflux by inhibition of raft lipid synthesis . These observations reveal a role for lipid - 96 driven domains in Golgi cargo sorting and provide a quantitative description of membrane protein 97 dynamics through the secretory pathway . 98 99 Results 100 ER exit rates are determined more by cytosolic sorting motifs than raft affinity . In previous work , we used 101 protein constructs comprised solely of transmembrane domains ( TMDs ) to interrogate raft - dependent 102 recycling in the endocytic system ( Diaz - Rohrer et al . , 2023 ; Diaz - Rohrer et al . , 2014b ; Lorent et al . , 2017 ) . 103 The preference of these probes for raft domains can be quantified directly by measuring their partitioning 104 between ordered ( raft ) and disordered ( non - raft ) phases of isolated GPMVs ( Levental and Levental , 105 2015a ; Sezgin et al . , 2012 ) , as shown in Fig 1A - B . As previously shown ( Diaz - Rohrer et al . , 2014b ; Lorent 106 et al . , 2017 ) , the TMD of a single - pass transmembrane adapter called Linker for Activation of T - cells 107 ( LAT ) preferentially partitions into the raft phase of GPMVs , away from the non - raft phase lipid marker 108 ( F - DiO ) ( Fig 1A , left ) . A model raft - excluded TMD is a 22 - Leu construct ( i . e . allL ) which strongly prefers 109 the non - raft phase ( Fig 1A , right ) . This behavior can be quantified via the raft partition coefficient ( K p , raft ) 110 defined as the ratio of background - subtracted intensities for various constructs in the raft versus non - raft 111 phases ( Fig 1B ) . The LAT TMD ( open symbols ) retains the raft affinity of full - length LAT , while allL - 112 TMD , either on its own or inserted into full - length LAT ( LAT - allL ) , has very low raft affinity ( Fig 1B ) . 113 4 To quantitatively assay the effects of raft affinity on the kinetics of secretory trafficking , we inserted these 114 probes into the RUSH system , which allows synchronized release and tracking through the secretory 115 system ( Fig 1C ) . This assay is based on the reversible interaction of a target protein ( fused to streptavidin - 116 binding peptide , SBP ) with a selective “hook” ; e . g . , streptavidin stably anchored in the ER via a KDEL 117 motif . The strong interaction between the hook and SBP retains the protein of interest ( POI ) in the ER . 118 Introduction of biotin causes rapid release of the POI , which is then tracked via a fluorescent tag . SBP - 119 tagged versions ( i . e . RUSH ) of all constructs assayed here had indistinguishable raft affinity from non - 120 SBP versions ( RFP - only ) ( Fig 1B ) . 121 The isolated TMD of LAT was sufficient to recapitulate the steady - state plasma membrane ( PM ) 122 localization of its full - length protein ( Fig S1 ) , consistent with previous reports ( Diaz - Rohrer et al . , 2014b ; 123 Lorent et al . , 2017 ) . In clear contrast , LAT - TMD did not recapitulate the ER exit kinetics of full - length 124 LAT ( Fig 1D ) . 45 mins after biotin addition , LAT had completely exited the ER and was localized almost 125 exclusively to a bright perinuclear region , likely the Golgi . After 90 min , most full - length LAT achieved 126 its steady - state localization at the PM . In contrast , LAT - TMD expressed in the same cell was still in the 127 ER after 90 min and clearly accumulated at the PM only after several hours . Such slow kinetics were a 128 challenge for live - cell imaging , so ER exit was quantified on a population level , by fixing cells at various 129 time points after biotin addition and quantifying the fraction of cells with observable ER localization . The 130 temporal reduction in the fraction of ER - positive cells was well described by a single - exponential fit for 131 all constructs ( e . g . Fig 1E ) , revealing that the half - time for ER exit was > 4 - fold faster for LAT ( 0 . 7 h ) 132 than for LAT - TMD ( 3 . 1 h ) ( Fig 1E - G ) . 133 We next tested whether raft affinity affected ER exit kinetics . To this end , we generated a RUSH construct 134 of full - length LAT whose TMD was replaced with one that has minimal raft affinity ( LAT - allL , Fig 1A ) . 135 The general kinetics of ER exit of this non - raft LAT were comparable to LAT , with clear Golgi 136 accumulation after 60 min of biotin . Post - Golgi accumulation was prominent at 90 min for both LAT and 137 LAT - allL ( the steady state localization of LAT - allL is in endolysosomes , Fig S1 , as previously explained 138 ( Diaz - Rohrer et al . , 2023 ; Diaz - Rohrer et al . , 2014b ) ) . In contrast , the isolated allL - TMD had much slower 139 ER exit kinetics ( Fig 1F - G ) . This trend was generalizable to several other proteins , with full - length 140 versions having > 3 - fold faster ER exit kinetics than the TMD - only versions , regardless of their raft affinity 141 ( Fig 1F - G , Table S1 ) . It is worth noting that isolated TMDs still exited the ER and reached a steady - state 142 localization after several hours ( Fig S1 ) , despite no direct interactions with cytosolic trafficking machinery 143 ( e . g . COPII or clathrin ) . Altogether , we conclude that features present in cytosolic domains play a 144 dominant role over TMD - determined raft affinity in ER exit . 145 5 146 Figure 1 .

All scale bars correspond to 5 µm . 163 164 LAT has a C - terminal Φ x Φ x Φ ER exit motif . LAT is comprised of a minimal N - terminal ectodomain ( < 5 165 residues ) , a single - pass TMD , and a largely disordered cytosolic domain ( CTD ) . Since LAT - TMD showed 166 slow ER exit , we inferred that the determinant of rapid ER exit is likely located in the CTD and created a 167 series of C - terminal truncations to locate the signal ( Fig 2A ) . The two smaller C - term truncations ( D Ct1 168 and D Ct2 ) had no effect on ER exit kinetics , behaving like full - length LAT ( Fig 2B - C ) . In contrast , both 169 larger truncations ( D Ct3 and D Ct4 ) were significantly slower , behaving like LAT - TMD ( Fig 2B - C ) . Thus , 170 the motif facilitating fast ER exit of LAT is located within residues 140 - 185 ( Fig 2A ) . We analyzed this 171 fragment for possible COPII binding motifs ( Barlowe , 2003b ; Mikros and Diallinas , 2019 ) and identified 172 146 AAPSA 152 , which corresponds to a Φ x Φ x Φ motif ( Φ = hydrophobic residue , x = spacer ) ( Otsu et al . , 173 2013 ) ( Fig 2A - inset ) . Point mutations in this putative motif confirmed that P148 and A150 were essential 174 for fast ER exit , while other neighboring residues were not ( Fig 2D - E and S2 ) . We note that these two 175 residues are highly conserved in LAT from 30 species ( Fig 2A ) . Finally , inserting this AaPsA motif into 176 LAT - TMD signficantly accelerated its ER exit , nearly recapitulating that of full - length LAT ( Fig 2F ) . 177 Thus , we conclude that fast ER exit of LAT is mediated by a ΦxΦxΦ motif in the cytosolic CTD , which 178 likely mediates COPII association . 179 7 180 Figure 2 .

The RUSH system can be adapted to measure exit rates 191 from Golgi by changing the “hook” to Golgin84 , a resident protein of cis - Golgi ( Diao et al . , 2003 ) . As 192 expected , all RUSH constructs ( LAT , LAT - TMD , LAT - allL , allL - TMD ) cotransfected with this hook 193 were localized almost exclusively in the Golgi without biotin ( Fig 3A ) . Within 90 min of biotin 194 introduction , LAT exited the Golgi , achieving the expected steady - state PM localization ( Fig 3A ) . LAT - 195 allL was clearly slower , with abundant Golgi signal remaining after 90 min . Tracking the kinetics by 196 quantitative imaging , LAT exited the Golgi ~ 2 . 5 - fold faster than LAT - allL ( Fig 3B - C ) . Strikingly , the 197 TMD - only versions of these constructs behaved nearly identically to the full - length ( Fig 3B - C ) . LAT - 198 TMD , which has almost no residues that could interact with cytosolic trafficking machinery , had similar 199 Golgi - exit kinetics as full length VSVG ( Fig S3 ) , a model transmembrane secretory cargo . The kinetics 200 of VSVG traffic measured here with RUSH are consistent previous measurement by an orthogonal method 201 ( Hirschberg et al . , 1998 ) , validating our approach . 202 To validate these conclusions in a different experimental paradigm , we measured Golgi exit kinetics after 203 a temperature block . It was previously shown that culturing mammalian cells at 15 - 20°C leads to 204 accumulation of secretory cargo in the Golgi ( Milgram and Mains , 1994 ; Venditti et al . , 2019 ) . To 205 accumulate our probes in the Golgi , we used the ER - RUSH constructs to initially restrict them to the ER 206 ( Fig 3D , left ) . Biotin was then added at 17°C for 3 h to release the protein from the ER and allow sufficient 207 time to accumulate in the Golgi . The cells were then shifted to 37°C to synchronize Golgi export . As with 208 Golgi - RUSH , LAT largely exited the Golgi within 90 min , whereas LAT - allL was significantly slower , 209 with notable Golgi accumulation remaining after 2 h ( Fig 3D ) . The kinetics of the temperature - block 210 experiment were similar to Golgi RUSH , with raft - preferring LAT exiting Golgi ~ 2 - fold faster than non - 211 raft LAT - allL . Based on these observations , we conclude that TMD - encoded raft affinity is an essential 212 determinant of Golgi exit kinetics for LAT . 213 9 214 Figure 3 . Golgi exit kinetics of LAT are dependent on its association with raft domains .

All scale bars = 5 µ m . 227 228 10 Kinetic model of secretory traffic . We attempted to rationalize our observations of ER and Golgi efflux 229 using a kinetic model wherein the secretory kinetics of a TMP are determined by equilibrium partitioning 230 between coexisting compartments in the ER and Golgi ( Fig 4A ) . In the model , partitioning to an ER - exit 231 compartment ( ERex ) ( analogous to a cellular ER exit site ) allows ER efflux with first - order rate constant 232 k a . Full - length and TMD - only proteins have different partition coefficients into this ERex compartment , 233 represented by two free fit parameters K p , ERex _ full and K p , ERex _ TMD . 234 Analogously in the Golgi , we model coexisting compartments that enrich raft or non - raft proteins , again 235 with partition coefficients ( i . e . K p , raft _ LAT and K p , raft _ allL ) describing the ratio of a protein’s concentration in 236 the two compartments . These values were set by measurements of K p , raft for the various constructs in 237 GPMVs ( Fig 1A - B ) , with the assumption that raft affinities measured at the PM are representative of those 238 in the Golgi . A first - order rate constant k b is used to describe the transfer of proteins from the Golgi raft 239 sub - compartment to post - Golgi compartments . This conceptual model can be represented via a series of 240 coupled differential equations describing the temporal evolution of abundance of various constructs in 241 three compartments ( ER , Golgi , post - Golgi ) . We emphasize that this model is highly simplified and does 242 not include many features relevant to trafficking of endogenous proteins . Rather , the goal was to identify 243 the minimal set of features that could describe the secretory behavior of our defined set of probes . 244 This simple model ( four free parameters ) was used to simultaneously fit experimental observations of 245 eight independent data sets , i . e . release from the ER or from the Golgi for four different protein constructs 246 ( analogous to experiments described in Fig 1 and 3 , respectively ) . For comparison to the models , 247 experimental datasets were re - measured via live - cell imaging ( see Supp Fig 5 ) to directly quantify relative 248 construct abundance in the ER or Golgi . Model global fits nicely reproduced the general experimental 249 features of all constructs ( Fig 4B ) , though with notable divergences . The general shape of both ER and 250 Golgi efflux curves were well described by the model and the specific Golgi efflux kinetics for all four 251 proteins were modeled quite accurately ( Fig 4B , filled symbols ) . Consistent with expectation , the fitted 252 ER exit partition coefficient ( K p , ERex _ full ) for full - length constructs ( i . e . those containing the putative COPII 253 binding motif ) was ~ 20 - fold greater than for TMD - only constructs . In contrast , the specific ER release 254 kinetics could not be completely reproduced , with the model underestimating ER efflux rate for both 255 constructs with raft - preferring TMDs , and overestimating those of the non - raft proteins ( i . e . allL ) ( Fig . 256 4B , open symbols ) . 257 These fits could not be improved by adding a Golgi - to - ER retrieval path , consistent with none of our 258 constructs possessing a known retrieval motif ( i . e . KDEL ) ( not shown ) . However , excellent agreement 259 between the model and all experimental observations could be obtained by allowing the ERex partition 260 coefficients of LAT and LAT - allL to independently vary ( Fig 4C ) . Put another way , in this 5 - parameter 261 fit , the TMD of these constructs was allowed to influence their affinity for the ER exit compartment . The 262 best - fit was obtained when LAT with a wild - type TMD had ~ 6 - fold greater affinity for the ERex than 263 LAT - allL . 264 11 265 Figure 4 .

A key aspect of the model is that selective Golgi membrane domains are 277 important for Golgi exit kinetics of raft - associated cargo . To test this inference , we used inhibitors to block 278 the production of raft - forming lipids ( Lasserre et al . , 2008 ; Levental et al . , 2017 ) and tested their effects 279 on trafficking rates of our probes . Specifically , sphingolipid and cholesterol synthesis were inhibited by 280 treatment with 25 µ M myriocin and 5 µ M Zaragozic acid ( MZA ) , respectively , for 2 days . This treatment 281 was previously shown by us and others to reduce ordered membrane domain stability ( Lasserre et al . , 282 12 2008 ; Levental et al . , 2017 ; Wang et al . , 2023 ) . We observed significantly reduced Golgi exit kinetics of 283 LAT - TMD in MZA - treated cells , evidenced by clear Golgi localization up to 2 h after release of Golgi - 284 RUSH , in contrast to control cells ( Fig 4D ) . Quantifying exit kinetics by imaging Golgi residence , we 285 observed that the half - time for Golgi exit was significantly increased ( by ~ 60 % ) for the raft - preferring 286 TMD but not for the non - raft allL - TMD ( Fig 4E - F ) . 287 288 Segregation of raft from non - raft proteins in Golgi compartments . 289 To directly image separation between raft and non - raft probes in the Golgi , we co - transfected RUSH 290 versions of LAT - TMD and allL - TMD with the Golgin84 - hook to reversibly accumulate both constructs 291 in the Golgi . Their colocalization was then imaged using super - resolved Structured Illumination 292 Microscopy ( SIM ) ( Fig 5A - B ) . Prior to introduction of biotin , the two constructs showed near - perfect 293 colocalization , as expected from their association with the same “hook” . However , 5 minutes after 294 releasing the proteins with biotin , their colocalization was significantly reduced ( Fig 5C ) , with areas of 295 LAT - TMD and allL - TMD enrichment apparent within the general morphology of the Golgi ( Fig 5B ) . 296 Similar segregation of LAT - TMD from allL - TMD could be observed when both were accumulated in the 297 Golgi via a 20°C temperature block ( Fig 5D ) . Notably , such segregation was not observed when LAT - 298 TMD was co - accumulated in the Golgi with either the full - length LAT or with raft - preferring GPI - GFP , 299 which colocalized nearly completely with each other ( Fig 5D ) . 300 13 301 Figure 5 .

We combined 317 this treatment with the Golgi - RUSH ( Golgin84 - hook ) constructs to determine the fate of raft - and non - 318 raft probes when their Golgi exit is blocked . Trapping both constructs in Golgi via RUSH produced very 319 high co - localization , as expected ( Fig 5F ) . When the constructs were released with biotin in cells treated 320 with Cer - C6 , LAT - TMD and allL - TMD both remained in a perinuclear compartment with the general 321 morphology of the Golgi , but their colocalization was notably reduced , with raft - TMD - rich and - depleted 322 areas visible under confocal imaging ( Fig 5F ) . This reduced colocalization was also observed without 323 biotin present , suggesting that Cer - C6 led to a remodeling of the Golgi and associated spatial segregation 324 of raft from non - raft probe proteins , as previously proposed ( van Galen et al . , 2014 ) . 325 These observations are consistent with previous reports that proteins can segregate in Golgi ( Chen et al . , 326 2017 ) . Specifically , TGN46 , a resident protein in the vesicular trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) , was shown to 327 physically segregate from a trans - Golgi - resident enzyme Sialyltransferase ( ST ) under Cer - C6 treatment 328 ( van Galen et al . , 2014 ) . To determine whether this physical segregation was related to the behavior of 329 our raft domain probes , we co - transfected these Golgi - resident proteins with our probes and imaged them 330 under Cer - C6 treatment . Intriguingly , in Cer - C6 - treated cells , the raft probe ( LAT - TMD ) colocalized well 331 with TGN46 but not with ST ( Fig 5G - H ) . Conversely , the non - raft - preferring probe ( allL - TMD ) 332 colocalized with ST , but not TGN46 . These colocalization were consistent with the raft affinity of the 333 Golgi markers evaluated in GPMVs : TGN46 was enriched in the raft phase approximately at parity with 334 LAT - TMD , while ST was depleted from the raft phase ( like allL - TMD ) . These observations support the 335 hypothesis that proteins can segregate in Golgi based on their affinity for distinct membrane domains . 336 337 Discussion 338 The central paradigm of membrane protein traffic involves recognition of cargo sorting motifs by adaptor 339 proteins , which then associate with coat - forming machinery to form inter - organelle trafficking 340 intermediates with compositions that are distinct from their source organelles . Our study suggests that 341 lipid - mediated organization also plays a supporting role in this process . 342 15 Several short motifs in cargo cytosolic domains have been reported to mediate recognition by the COPII 343 machinery for ER efflux . Originally identified were di - acidic ( e . g . DxE ) and di - Leu motifs ( Barlowe , 344 2003b ) , and more recently other sequences with similar roles were identified ( Barlowe , 2003b ; Mikros 345 and Diallinas , 2019 ; Otsu et al . , 2013 ) . Our study reveals that a ΦxΦxΦ motif mediates fast ER exit of the 346 transmembrane scaffold LAT ( Fig 2 ) . Notably , constructs missing this motif ( including LAT - TMD ) still 347 eventually fully exit the ER and reach their steady - state localization , consistent with passive “leakage” 348 from the ER even in the absence of viable COPII interactions . 349 Although this motif plays a dominant role in determining LAT ER exit kinetics , our observations suggest 350 a minor contribution of lipid interactions with the protein’s TMD . This contribution is revealed in different 351 ER exit kinetics of raft - and nonraft - preferring versions of either full - length or TMD - only constructs ( Fig 352 1G ) . This inference was supported by the kinetic model , which showed the best global fit to experiments 353 when raft - preferring LAT - TMD had a somewhat higher partitioning to ER exit compartments than nonraft 354 LAT - allL ( Fig 4C ) . A possible contribution of lipid domains to ER traffic is surprising , as ER cholesterol 355 abundance is believed to be too low to allow formation of ordered lipid domains ( van Meer et al . , 2008 ) . 356 However , synthetic lipid experiments show that cholesterol concentrations as low as 10 mol % can support 357 liquid - ordered phases ( Veatch and Keller , 2002 , 2003 ) and locally high cholesterol concentrations are 358 possible through localized production , recruitment by proteins , and / or diffusion barriers ( Prasad et al . , 359 2020 ) . Indeed , enrichment of fluorescent cholesterol at some ER exit sites was recently reported ( Weigel 360 et al . , 2021 ) . We emphasize that our study provides no direct evidence for rafts in the ER and much more 361 extensive characterization would be required to make a convincing claim . However , both our data and 362 model reveal that preferences of certain proteins for ordered membrane regions affect their ER exit rates . 363 Sorting of protein and lipid cargo in the Golgi is the originally proposed role for raft domains in cells 364 ( Simons and Ikonen , 1997 ) , supported by the Golgi’s relatively high levels of cholesterol , sphingomyelin , 365 and glycolipids ( Jackson et al . , 2016 ; van Meer et al . , 2008 ) . Segregation of cargo prior to Golgi exit has 366 been microscopically observed ( Chen et al . , 2017 ) and anterograde sorting to the PM is facilitated by 367 palmitoylation ( Chum et al . , 2016 ; Ernst et al . , 2018 ) , a post - translational modification that imparts raft 368 affinity to many TMPs ( Levental et al . , 2010 ; Lorent et al . , 2017 ) . PM - directed vesicles in yeast are 369 enriched in sterols and sphingolipids relative to the Golgi , supporting a raft - based sorting model ( Klemm 370 et al . , 2009 ; Surma et al . , 2011 ) . Similarly , in mammalian cells , sphingomyelin is enriched in certain 371 Golgi - to - PM carriers ( Deng et al . , 2016 ; Sundberg et al . , 2019 ) . Our observations are fully consistent with 372 these results and implicate ordered lipid domains in LAT traffic from the Golgi . Full - length LAT and its 373 isolated TMD have similar Golgi efflux kinetics , both of which are approximately 2 - fold faster than 374 nonraft analogs ( Fig 3 ) . This behavior was observed with either RUSH or temperature - block and 375 supported by our kinetic model , which predicts raft - dependent exit from the Golgi ( Fig . 4 ) . Whether these 376 observations reflect faster movement between cisternae or faster exit at the TGN remains an open question . 377 Direct visualization of lipid - driven domains remains a challenge , particularly acute in intracellular 378 membranes which are often small and have complex morphologies . Our SIM imaging suggests 379 segregation of raft from nonraft cargo in the Golgi shortly ( 5 min ) after RUSH release ( Fig 5B ) , but these 380 16 images only reveal reduced colocalization not actual protein distributions . Moreover , segregation within 381 a Golgi cisterna would be very difficult to distinguish from cargo moving between cisternae at different 382 rates or exiting via Golgi - proximal vesicles . Perhaps the most striking instance of separation of raft - from 383 nonraft - Golgi is observable after treatment with a short - chain ceramide ( C6 - cer ) , which has been reported 384 to disrupt formation of post - Golgi vesicles ( Campelo et al . , 2017 ; van Galen et al . , 2014 ) . In these distorted 385 Golgi , we observe selective colocalization of the raft probe with TGN - 46 , and vice versa for nonraft and 386 ST ( Fig 6 ) . 387 Collectively , these observations suggest that raft domains play a major role in Golgi - to - PM traffic for 388 certain cargoes and that raft affinity is the dominant determinant of Golgi efflux kinetics for LAT . This 389 protein belongs to a family of transmembrane adaptor proteins ( TRAPs ) with similar general structures 390 and functions ( Chum et al . , 2016 ; Park and Yun , 2009 ) , suggesting that these observations may be relevant 391 for this class of proteins and perhaps others without motifs for clathrin - and adaptor - mediated sorting . In 392 contrast , rafts may play a more subordinate role in ER exit , perhaps facilitating the sorting of certain cargo 393 proteins and lipids to ER exit sites . 394 395 Material and methods 396 Cell culture 397 HEK - 293NT ( HEK ) and HeLa cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured in medium containing 89 % 398 Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium ( EMEM ) , 10 % FCS , and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin at 37 °C in 399 humidified 5 % CO2 . COS - 7 cells were cultured in medium containing the same formulation but with 400 Dulbecco Modified Essential Medium ( DMEM ) instead of EMEM and under the same conditions . 401 Transfection was done by Lipofectamine 3000 using the protocols provided with the reagents . 4 – 6 h after 402 transfection , cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with serum - free medium overnight . To 403 synchronize the cells , 1 h before biotin addition , the cells were given full - serum medium . Lipid synthesis 404 inhibitors ( 25 uM Myriocin and 5 uM Zaragozic Acid ) were added for to the medium and given to the 405 cells 2 days before transfection and during the whole experiment . D - Ceramide - C6 was added to the 406 medium alone or in combination with biotin and given to the cells for 4 h , and then cells were fixed . 407 Plasmids and mutations 408 All single pass protein constructs from the ER were based on the bicistronic GPI RUSH backbone 409 previously described . We replaced the protein and fluorophore by the amino acid sequence of LAT - TMD , 410 which is NH2 - MEEAILVPCVLGLLLLPILAMLMALCVHCHRLP followed by a short linker ( GSGS ) 411 and monomeric RFP ( mRFP ) . A full length ( LAT , LATallL , LAX ) and TMD library ( all - TMD , allA8L - 412 TMD , LAT - TMD6Dendo , TfR - TMD , LAX - TMD , VSVG - TMD , LATDC1 - 4 , P148E , P148S , P148A , 413 A150S , P151S , P151A , A183S ) were generated by amplifying the sequence of interest by PCR and 414 subsequent cloning of the mutant sequence into the LAT - TMD RUSH construct with KDEL hook to 415 synchronize from the ER . Several constructs were purchased from Addgene : full length RUSH version of 416 VSVG ( # 65300 ) . All the single pass RUSH constructs from Golgi were based on the bicistronic VSVG 417 17 RUSH backbone kindly donated by Jennifer Lippincott - Schwartz lab . We cut the construct with BamHI 418 and EcoRI and replaced the protein with LAT , LATallL , LAT - TMD or all - TMD by amplifying the 419 sequence of interest by PCR . TGN46 and ST plasmids were provided by Felix Campelo lab . 420 Imaging 421 Unless specified , imaging was performed on a confocal microscope using appropriate filters for GFP / RFP 422 fluorescence for transfected plasmids . Single - cell tracking live imaging was performed using u - dish Grid - 423 50 glass bottom plates ( Ibidi GmbH ) to relocate the selected cells at each acquisition after incubating at 424 37°C in the incubator when not imaging . When needed , cells were fixed using 4 % paraformaldehyde 425 ( PFA ) , 10 min at RT . Anti - Giantin ( 1 : 1000 Rabbit polyclonal , Abcam ab80864 ) was used to create Golgi 426 mask . 427 RUSH expression and chase 428 In brief , transfected cells with different plasmids containing the RUSH retention system were incubated 429 overnight at 37 °C , and then incubated in the presence of 100 µM biotin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) to release the 430 cargo proteins . Cells were incubated at 37°C for various chase times and either directly imaged or fixed 431 with PFA as described above . 432 GPMVs and Kp quants 433 Cell membranes were stained with 5 μg / ml of FAST - DiO ( Invitrogen ) , green fluorescent lipid dye that 434 strongly partitions to disordered phases ( Levental and Levental , 2015b ) . Following staining , GPMVs were 435 isolated from transfected HEK - 293 , or HeLa cells as described ( Sezgin et al . , 2012 ) ( cell type had no effect 436 on results ) . Briefly , GPMV formation was induced by 2 mM N - ethylmaleimide ( NEM ) in hypotonic 437 buffer containing 100 mM NaCl , 10 mM HEPES , and 2 mM CaCl2 , pH 7 . 4 . To quantify protein 438 partitioning , GPMVs were observed on an inverted epifluorescence microscope ( Nikon ) at 4°C after 439 treatment with 200 μM DCA to stabilize phase separation ; this treatment has been previously 440 demonstrated not to affect raft affinity of various proteins ( Zhou et al . , 2013 ) . The partition coefficient 441 ( K p , raft ) for each protein construct was calculated from fluorescence intensity of the construct in the raft 442 and non - raft phase for > 10 vesicles / trial ( e . g . Fig . 1 ) , with multiple independent experiments for each 443 construct . 444 Conservation analysis 445 After discarding uncharacterized proteins and taking just the first 100 results from 246 hits in the Blast 446 for LAT sequence extracted from Uniprot database , we have used Unipro Ugene to analyze the results of 447 30 species with > 80 % similarity . 448 Kinetic model for trafficking of RUSH constructs . Residence fraction data were analyzed globally by 449 numerically solving a first - order , homogeneous system of equations that accounts for intra - and inter - 450 compartment transport . A schematic of the trafficking model is shown in Fig . 4A . Briefly , the ER was 451 modeled with two sub - compartments representing bulk and exit sites , with an intra - ER partition 452 coefficient K p , ERex , defined as the ratio of concentrations between the exit and bulk compartments . 453 18 Similarly , the Golgi was modeled with two sub - compartments representing raft and non - raft sites , with an 454 intra - Golgi partition coefficient K p , raft , , i . e . the ratio of concentrations between the raft and nonraft 455 compartments . These values are set in the model via measurements of K p , raft in GPMVs ( Fig 1 ) ( Diaz - 456 Rohrer et al . , 2023 ; Lorent et al . , 2017 ) . Inter - compartment trafficking from ER to Golgi initiates from 457 ER exit sites and terminates at the Golgi with a rate constant k a , while unidirectional post - Golgi traffic 458 originating from Golgi raft sites was modeled with a rate constant k b . In total , the trafficking model for a 459 given construct is a function of two rate constants and two partition coefficients , one of which is fixed 460 experimentally . 461 Eight data sets representing the ER and Golgi efflux kinetics of LAT , LAT - TMD , AllL - LAT , and AllL - 462 TMD were fit to the trafficking model . We performed a single global analysis ( i . e . simultaneous fit of all 463 eight data sets ) using k a , k b , and two K p , ERex ( one for full - length and one for TMD - only ) as free fit 464 parameters . A second analysis included a third K p , ERex , allowing LAT and LAT - allL to be different . 465 All analysis was performed with custom code written in Mathematica v . 12 . 2 ( Wolfram Research Inc . , 466 Champaign , IL ) . Model parameters were optimized with a Levenberg - Marquardt algorithm implemented 467 in the built - in Mathematica function NonlinearModelFit . The target function for minimization was the 468 sum of squared residuals for the combined data sets , 𝜒 ! = ∑ ∑ ( 𝑦 " # − 𝑦’ " # ) ! # " , where 𝑖 indexes the eight 469 data sets , j indexes the data points within a data set , 𝑦 " # is the observed residence fraction , and 𝑦’ " # is the 470 predicted residence fraction . To improve the probability of finding the global minimum , the optimization 471 was repeated 10 3 times with different random initial values for the adjustable parameters ; the best - fit 472 parameters associated with the overall lowest 𝜒 ! value is reported as the solution . 473 474 Acknowledgements 475 We thank members of the Levental lab for their discussions and critical feedback .
