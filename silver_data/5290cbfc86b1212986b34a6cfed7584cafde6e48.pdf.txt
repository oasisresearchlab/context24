In vegetal biology , the term ‘ferromics’ has been coined ; it covers all as - pects of research unraveling the mysteries behind the percep - tion and response to iron deficiency in plants [ 12 ] . It is a glo - bal approach , facilitated by the development of analytical and computational tools , that has allowed to decipher the biologi - cal processes assuring iron homeostasis in plants at the ge - nomic , transcriptomic , and proteomic levels as well as to pro - pose an integrative view on how plants respond to a varying supply of iron . The expression ‘ironomics’ has been used by investigators analyzing the role of iron transporters among Yersinia pestis biotypes and its nearest neighbor , Yersinia pseudotuberculosis [ 13 ] , whereas the term ‘ironome’ was used by authors to describe iron metabolism and trafficking within cells and organelles [ 14 , 15 ] . This review addresses some im - portant physiologic pathways involved in iron metabolism of human that have relevance to transfusion medicine specialists in charge of donor management . Iron Metabolism and Proteins The physiology of iron trafficking and metabolism has been well evaluated over the last 20 years , and several com - prehensive reviews have been published on the subject [ 16 – 22 ] . Many proteins have been identified playing roles in iron metabolism . Some proteins such as ferritin or Tf are the main cargos of blood iron , whereas peptides such as iron regulatory proteins ( IRPs ) , hepcidin , and matriptase ( Mt2 ) are key de - terminants of iron regulation at different physiological levels . A set of different proteins , notably divalent metal trans - Keywords Iron · Metabolism · Transfusion medicine Summary A revolution occurred during the last decade in the com - prehension of the physiology as well as in the physiopa - thology of iron metabolism . The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent knowledge that has accumu - lated , allowing a better comprehension of the mecha - nisms implicated in iron homeostasis . Iron metabolism is very fine tuned . The free molecule is very toxic ; there - fore , complex regulatory mechanisms have been devel - oped in mammalian to insure adequate intestinal ab - sorption , transportation , utilization , and elimination . ‘Iro - nomics’ certainly will be the future of the understanding of genes as well as of the protein - protein interactions in - volved in iron metabolism . Introduction Various tests have been developed to evaluate iron metab - olism and iron stores , and nowadays bone marrow examina - tion has been replaced by the measurement of blood ferritin [ 1 ] . However , more sophisticated tests are available , notably measurements of transferrin ( Tf ) , of soluble transferrin recep - tor ( sTfr ) or of hepcidin , reflecting dynamics of iron metabo - lism . In addition , many genetic variations of proteins , directly or indirectly involved in iron metabolism have been de - scribed , and their identification proved useful for the diagno - sis of iron metabolic disorders [ 2 – 9 ] . D o w n l o aded b y : 83 . 77 . 1 34 . 247 - 5 / 14 / 201 4 10 : 16 : 01 P M Transfus Med Hemother 2014 ; 41 : 000 – 000 Waldvogel - Abramowski / Waeber / Gassner / Buser / Frey / Favrat / Tissot A JAK - STAT3 pathway , triggered by IL - 6 receptor dimer - ization with gp130 upon binding of the cognate ligand IL - 6 is the primary pathway for hepcidin regulation in inflammation [ 39 ] . Iron sensing is dependent on an external pathway impli - cating the interactions of Tf on Tfr1 and Tfr2 and aid by the protein HFE . The binding of iron - loaded Tf to Tfr1 followed by the binding of Tfr2 depends on iron saturation of Tf ; if iron - Tf is high , the Tfr2 - mediated signaling by theBMP6 re - ceptor complex is increased . [ 40 ] . After activation of the BMP receptor , the SMAD pathway is activated leading to over - ex - pression of hepcidin . In contrast , hepcidin mRNA is sup - pressed in anemia [ 59 ] , but this effect is probably indirect , de - pending on the erythropoietin production [ 60 ] . Furthermore , at least 3 other proteins play roles by interacting between BMPs and the BMP receptor . The first protein is hemojuvelin ( HJV ) a glycosylphosphatidylinositol - linked membrane pro - tein [ 41 ] , the second is Mt2 [ 42 ] , which regulates the levels of membrane - bound HJV , and the third is neogenin , a ubiqui - tously expressed transmembrane protein with multiple func - tions [ 43 – 48 ] . The gene of Mt2 carries several polymorphisms that have been linked to iron metabolic parameters , notably in patients presenting with iron - refractory iron - deficient ane - mia [ 49 – 58 ] . In blood , hepcidin exists in mature - and pro - hormone form ( prohepcidin ) . Prohepcidin was found to specifically bind to the STAT3 site in the promoter of the HAMP gene , thus sug - gesting that prohepcidin affects the expression of its own gene , indicating an autoregulatory loop of hepcidin gene ex - pression [ 24 ] . Using liquid chromatography in combination with high - resolution mass spectrometry , we and others were able to identify new forms of hepcidin in human plasma or serum samples [ 59 , 60 ] . porter - 1 ( DMT1 ) , ferroportin ( FPN1 ) , and transferrin recep - tors ( Tfrs ) in association with ferroxidases such as duodenal cytochrome B , ceruloplamin ( Cp ) and heme carrier protein ( HCP1 ) , are involved in the cellular membrane transportation of iron [ 23 ] . Others proteins such as myoglobin ( Mb ) , Hb , and many different enzymes are the ‘end’ products of iron metab - olism , because they require iron for their functions . Hepcidin ; the Queen of ‘Ironomics’ It is impossible to present a review dealing with iron me - tabolism without mentioning the central role of hepcidin as well as the pioneering works of Tomas Ganz and Elisabeta Nemeth . These two investigators , in collaboration with nu - merous other scientists , published about 100 scientific pa - pers between 2003 and 2013 , and more than a half of them contained the key word hepcidin . Hepcidin , is the biological equivalent of the Queen of the Night of the Mozart’s opera ‘The Magic Flute’ ; it is a 25 amino acid peptide hormone , mainly produced by hepatocytes ( fig . 1 ) . The peptide is en - coded by the HAMP gene [ 24 ] which codes for the precur - sor protein pro - hepcidin which then is cleaved into the ac - tive hepcidin . Many mechanisms involved in the regulation of hepcidin synthesis in relation to iron have been eluci - dated [ 25 – 27 ] . Physiological and pathological conditions such as release of bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) [ 28 ] , hypoxia [ 29 , 30 ] as well as endocrine [ 31 – 34 ] , metabolic [ 35 , 36 ] , and inflammatory [ 17 , 37 , 38 ] processes modulate hepci - din biosynthesis and may therefore regulate availability of iron to erythropoiesis by adaptation of iron absorption and recirculation . Fig . 1 . Many mechanisms are involved in the regulation of hepcidin synthesis . The peptide is mainly produced by the liver , in responses to many different mechanisms . In presence of inflammation as well as in situations with in - creased intracellular and extracellular iron stores , the concentration of hepcidin is increased . In - versely , when iron requirements are high , such as in increased erythropoiesis , hepcidin levels are low . Hepcidin blocks the exportation of iron from hepatocytes , macrophages as well as from the enterocytes , by binding to ferroportin ( FPN1 ) allowing it internalization and degrada - tion ( illustrations used elements from Servier Medical Art : www . servier . fr / servier - medical - art ) . D o w n l o aded b y : 83 . 77 . 1 34 . 247 - 5 / 14 / 201 4 10 : 16 : 01 P M Transfus Med Hemother 2014 ; 41 : 000 – 000 Physiology of Iron Metabolism teins such as Mb , cytochromes , or other ferroproteins . Only about 3 mg are bound to plasma Tf and constitute the mobile iron compartment which supplies the various intracellular iron stores . Figure 2 presents the main steps of iron metabolism . About 1 – 2 mg of iron is lost every day , through skin and enteric desquamation and minor blood losses . This loss is bal - anced by intestinal absorption . Therefore , iron recycling ac - counts for most of the iron homeostasis in human . The situa - tion is different in menstruating women [ 62 , 63 ] where there are controversial discussions about iron stores , ferritin , and Hb levels [ 64 , 65 ] . It appears that lower Hb and ferritin values in menstruating women have been accepted as normal rather than possibly representing widespread iron deficiency . The situation is even more complex in pregnant women ; neverthe - less , iron substitution has been shown to be beneficial for them [ 66 , 67 ] . Similarly , increased iron demand occurs during infancy and childhood due to growth and development de - mands [ 68 – 70 ] . Iron in the Food ; Unusual Aspects Iron is the most abundant element on earth , with potential of high toxicity to living cells . However , it has poor bioavaila - bility , and efforts have been made to provide iron for every - body , notably by food fortification within rice [ 71 ] , because it represents one of the most essential nutriments for human be - ings . Rice and most staple cereals contain low iron levels , since most iron - containing components are lost during grain processing . Populations with monotonous diets consisting mainly of cereals are especially prone to iron deficiency , which affects about two billion people . Food fortification programs to supplement nutrition with iron have not been very successful . One alternative solution is iron biofortification . Different approaches have been studied , including conventional breeding and directed genetic modifi - cation , which offer the most rapid way to develop iron - rich rice plants [ 71 ] . Biofortification of crops is also an interesting approach [ 72 ] , and at least two complementary approaches have been successfully adopted to increase the concentrations of bioavailable mineral elements in food crops . First , applica - tion of mineral fertilizers and / or improving the solubilization and mobilization of mineral elements in the soil has been im - plemented . Secondly , crops have been developed with in - creased abilities to acquire mineral elements and accumulate them in edible tissues . In the same context , it seems necessary to highlight the efforts made by some investigators , who de - veloped high - iron rice , using transgenic approaches . They cre - ated high - iron rice by insertion of soybean ferritin gene under the control of the endosperm - specific glutelin promoter into the genome of the Indica rice line [ 73 ] . However , and because of widespread skepticism about transgenic food , it is still nec - essary to know the iron content of the usual food taken by our Iron Regulatory Proteins Iron is present in many different types of cells , having spe - cific functions such as iron supply or iron storage . Iron - ex - porting cells include enterocytes , which absorb iron from the digested food , macrophages and hepatocytes , which both re - cycle iron according to demand . In addition , placental syncy - tiotrophoblast cells transport iron into the fetal circulation . Cellular iron homeostasis is maintained by IRP1 and IRP2 ( reviewed in [ 61 ] ) . IRPs bind to iron - responsive elements ( IREs ) located in the untranslated regions of genes and mRNAs encoding proteins involved in iron uptake , storage , utilization , and export . The IRP / IRE system is thus effectively involved in the fine - tuning of the synthesis as well as suppres - sion of the many proteins involved in the multiple ‘ironomics’ pathways . Iron in the Body Males contain about 4 , 000 mg of iron , of which 2 , 500 mg are within erythrocytes ; 1 , 000 mg is stored in splenic and he - patic macrophages , and the rest is distributed in various pro - Fig . 2 . Iron metabolism is finely regulated . Males contain about 4 , 000 mg of iron , of which 2 , 500 mg is within erythrocytes ; 1 , 000 mg is stored in splenic and hepatic macrophages , and the rest is distributed in various pro - teins such as myoglobin , cytochromes or other ferroproteins . About 1 – 2 mg of iron is lost every day , through skin and enteric desquamation and minor blood losses . This loss is balanced by intestinal absorption . Therefore , iron recycling accounts for most of the iron homeostasis in human . The situa - tion is different in menstruating women where there are discussions about iron stores , ferritin and hemoglobin levels ( illustrations used elements from Servier Medical Art : www . servier . fr / servier - medical - art ) .

The distinction is of potential interest , because it has been shown that high heme iron intake leads to increased body iron stores which are significantly associated with higher risk to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus [ 79 ] . In contrast , total die - tary iron , non - heme iron , and intake of iron supplements were not associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus . Several well regulated gate keeper proteins are expressed in the duodenum enterocytes and are differently regulated as compared to the same proteins in liver cells . DMT1 is the most important transporter of ferrous iron ( Fe 2 + ) , [ 80 , 81 ] . Of note , ferric reductase activities due to duodenal cytochrome B [ 82 ] and STEAPs ( six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate proteins ) [ 83 ] are present on the brush border of duodenum allowing reduction of ferric to ferrous iron , thus facilitating its absorption by DMT1 . Heme iron is an important nutritional source of iron in car - nivores and omnivores that is more readily absorbed than non - heme iron derived from vegetables and grain . Most heme is absorbed in the proximal intestine , with absorptive capacity decreasing distally , and the role of specific proteins such as hephaestin has been deciphered [ 84 , 85 ] . HCP1 , which presents homology to bacterial metal - tetracycline transport - ers , mediates heme uptake by the cells at the luminal brush border membrane of duodenal enterocytes . HCP1 mRNA has been shown to be highly expressed in the duodenum and reg - ulated by hypoxia and by IRPs . Intestinal Iron Exportation Once iron is present in the enterocyte , its fate de pends on the iron pool within the cell . Iron has to be exported from populations . This is why the knowledge of the iron content of various aliments as well as of the factors influencing its ab - sorption should be improved [ 74 ] . Finally , from a hematologist point of view , universal iron fortification of the food may be problematic , notably for indi - viduals with hemochromatosis and other iron loading diseases [ 75 ] . Even if iron fortification of food has been recognized by some authors as a suitable strategy to combat iron deficiency , some health authorities have abandoned it . Readers inter - ested in iron fortification , iron food , and other deviancies are referred to the recent reviews published in 2012 [ 67 , 76 ] . Intestinal Iron Absorption A typical European diet provides about 15 mg of iron , and only 10 % is absorbed . Iron absorption is the result of complex mechanisms that takes place in the upper parts of the gut , nota - bly in the duodenum and the proximal jejunum [ 16 , 77 ] ( fig . 3 ) . On the brush border of enterocytes , various iron import proteins are present , and specific pathways of absorption have been described for the two ionic forms of iron ( Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + ; both being non - heme iron molecules ) and also for iron associ - ated with heme ( heme iron ) [ 16 ] . Non - heme iron is associated with various storage proteins , including ferritin , whereas heminic iron is present within hemoproteins such as Mb or Hb . At acidic pH in the stomach , heme is dissociated from hemo - proteins , whereas non - heme iron stabilizes in its reduced form ( Fe 2 + ) . It is important to note that non - heme iron is captured by several complexes which can interfere with its absorption , notably plant - derived phytates or tannins [ 78 ] . Ascorbic acid and other acidic components derived from the diet can in - crease iron absorption . Nevertheless , it is known that different Fig . 3 . Regulation of iron absorption and ex - portation by enterocytes . Both heme and non - heme iron are absorbed by specific pathways , including divalent metal transporter - 1 ( DMT - 1 ) and heme carrier protein ( HCP1 ) , in association with the ferrireductase , duodenal cytochrome B ( Dcytb ) . Within the cell , iron can be stored within the ferritin molecule . The metal is exported by the protein ferroportin ( FPN1 ) , and transported into the blood by transferrin . In presence of hepcidin , ferroportin is internal - ized and degradated . Thus , iron exportation is blocked . Inversely , in the absence of hepcidin , ferroportin is maintained on the cell membrane , and iron transportation is facilitated ( illustra - tions used elements from Servier Medical Art : www . servier . fr / servier - medical - art ) . D o w n l o aded b y : 83 . 77 . 1 34 . 247 - 5 / 14 / 201 4 10 : 16 : 01 P M Transfus Med Hemother 2014 ; 41 : 000 – 000 Physiology of Iron Metabolism shed as a soluble form ( sTfr ) into the extracellular and intra - vascular space . This shedding of Tfr1 is known for more than 30 years , and its assessment is well accepted as a diagnostic marker of iron - depleted erythropoiesis [ 96 – 98 ] . Very recently , the cleavage site as well as the cleaving proteases of mem - brane Tfr1 have been identified [ 99 ] . Intracellular Iron Storage Only ferric iron is transported to the cytoplasm or to mito - chondria . It is therefore mandatory to reduce ferrous irons ; a family of ferrireductase has been identified . These proteins are known under the acronym STEAP . STEAP 1 – 4 are the most relevant [ 100 ] , STEAP 3 being particularly important within erythroid precursors [ 101 ] . DMT1 is also an essential protein involved in iron transportation from vacuole into the cytoplasm [ 102 ] . In macrophages , another protein ( Nramp1 ) is involved [ 103 , 104 ] . Due to its toxicity , iron within the cyto - plasm is associated with proteins such as poly ( RC ) - binding protein 1 [ 105 ] , functioning as cytosolic iron chaperone in the delivery of iron to ferritin . Within the ferritin molecule , iron is stored in the ferric form associated with hydroxide and phosphate anions [ 106 ] . Each ferritin molecule can sequester up to approximately 4 , 500 iron atoms . Ferritin also has enzy - matic properties , converting ferric to ferrous iron , as iron is internalized and sequestered in the ferritin mineral core . Small quantities of ferritin are also present in human serum and are elevated in conditions of iron overload and inflam - mation . Serum ferritin is iron - poor , and may contain a novel ‘G’ ( glycosylated ) subunit [ 107 ] . De Domenico et al . [ 108 ] showed that ferritin secretion results when cellular ferritin synthesis occurs in the relative absence of free cytosolic iron . An interesting observation was made by Mikhael et al . [ 109 ] who showed that ferritin in macrophages is not a significant source of iron for the cell’s own metabolic functions . For dec - ades , serum ferritin has been used for assessing iron disor - ders , and its value as a marker of body iron has been recently reviewed [ 110 ] . Several genetic alteration of ferritin genes have been re - ported [ 107 ] , notably in association with a specific neurologi - cal disease [ 111 ] . Iron and Erythropoiesis Erythroid precursors need much more iron than any other type of cells in the body , and , as previously mentioned , they take up iron almost exclusively through Tfr1 . Iron transport into mitochondria is provided by mitoferrin - 1 , the mitochon - drial iron transporter 1 of erythroid precurors [ 112 ] . Mitofer - rin - 1 interacts with an ATP - binding transporter and binds to ferrochelatase to form an oligomeric complex [ 113 ] , allowing iron uptake and heme biosynthesis . cells to the circulation , and a specific protein , FPN1 , has been identified in this function . FPN1 is a multipass protein found in the basolateral membrane of the enterocytes . Furthermore , FPN1 is the unique iron export membrane protein that is present in large quantities on macrophages . Over - expression of FPN1 is induced by cellular iron , and it is suppressed by hepcidin . Hepcidin binds to cell surface FPN1 inducing its in - ternalization which is followed by lysosomal degradation [ 21 ] . Thus , as a consequence , the iron efflux from enterocytes or macrophages is suppressed , leading to reduced iron absorp - tion by duodenal enterocytes . Deletion of the FPN1 gene re - sults in a complete block of iron exportation associated with accumulation of the metal within enterocytes and macro - phages [ 86 ] . Once exported by FPN1 , iron needs to be transformed from the ferrous into the ferric form by ferroxidases such as Cp in order to bind iron to Tf ( which can only fix Fe 3 + ) . With - out activity of ferroxidases , FPN1 is internalized and de - graded [ 87 , 88 ] . Thus , the ferroxidases at the cell surface me - diate stability of FPN1 . In humans with aceruloplasminemia , anemia is associated with impaired cellular iron export [ 89 ] . As previously mentioned , HCP1 , which is also a ferroxidase , has also an important role during iron export from intestinal enterocytes and its subsequent loading to Tf . Structurally , the ectodomain of HCP1 resemble Cp [ 90 ] . Iron Transportation in Blood and Import Tf is the main protein involved in iron transport in plasma . Normally , between 20 and 40 % of the binding sites of the pro - tein are occupied by ferric iron . The diagnostic value of Tf has just been reviewed [ 91 ] . It proved to be a useful parameter for assessing both iron deficiency and iron overload . The satura - tion of Tf is a strong indicator of iron overload . However , from a physiological point of view , the iron binding capacity of plasma Tf is often exhausted , with concomitant generation of non - Tf - bound iron ( NTBI ) as observed in transfused pa - tients . Using fluorescent tracing of labile iron in endosomal vesicles and cytosol , Kloss - Brandstatter et al . [ 92 ] showed that NTBI fractions derived from sera of polytransfused tha - lassemia major patients entered cells via endocytosis . Erythrocyte precursors restrictively take up iron by using Tfr , notably Tfr1 , whereas hepatocytes and other non - eryth - roid cells are also able to use NTBI . Iron - Tf binds to Tfr , and the complexes are internalized within the cell by the endo - somal recycling vesicles . Thus , the Tf cycle is dependent on the Tf - Tfr complex trafficking , involving internalization of the complex within endosome , followed by iron release upon acidification of the endosome and recycling of the Tf - Tfr com - plex to the cell surface . Each of these steps is mediated by a specific pathway and specific machinery [ 93 – 95 ] . Finally , at the cell surface , at neutral pH , Tf dissociates from Tfr , and is used to repeat the iron cycle . In addition , Tfr is cleaved and D o w n l o aded b y : 83 . 77 . 1 34 . 247 - 5 / 14 / 201 4 10 : 16 : 01 P M Transfus Med Hemother 2014 ; 41 : 000 – 000 Waldvogel - Abramowski / Waeber / Gassner / Buser / Frey / Favrat / Tissot anemia . McLaren et al . [ 126 ] evaluated the association be - tween polymorphic loci and iron deficiency defined by hypo - ferritinemia . They found significant association of SNPs at the Tf gene as well as at the HFE gene with iron deficiency . In an analysis of several genes modulating iron status , Pelucchi et al . [ 127 ] showed that CYBRD1 modulates the phenotype of homozygous C282Y hemochromatosis , indicating a role of CYBRD1 in regulation of iron metabolism . Conclusions and Perspective Iron is a key player in hemoglobin synthesis an erythrocyte production . At the same time , it is a potent poison to mam - malian cells and an indispensable nutrient for many disease - causing germs and microbes . Therefore , its metabolism in mammalians is very complex and stringently controlled by many different genes and proteins . Identification of the genes and their polymorphic alleles may shed light into the meta - bolic interplay of relevant proteins . ‘Ironomics’ may prove useful to better characterize patients with either iron defi - ciency or iron loading diseases . Finally , ‘ironomics’ may be the ultimate goal for qualification and selection of individuals for blood donation according to their iron stores and of their capacity to maintain adequate iron metabolism despite supra - physiological iron depletion by blood donation . Disclosure Statement BF and JDT received fees from Vifor Pharma . SWA , BF and JDT re - ceived research grants from Robapharm . BF also received research grants from Vifor Pharma . GW , CG , AB , and BMF declared no conflict of inter - est regarding this paper . Erythroid cells contain adaptative mechanisms to face iron deficiency and a class of kinases activated by different cellular stresses . For example , during iron deficiency , and as heme concentration drop , heme dissociate from the heme - regulated inhibitor kinase ( HRI ) , leading to its autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the α - subunit of eukaryotic transla - tion initiation factor 2 [ 114 , 115 ] . HRI - deficient mice have al - lowed identifying HRI as a protector of apoptosis and being involved in the formation of microcytes . Genetic Polymorphism of Proteins Involved in Iron Metabolism Several groups reported on the genetic polymorphism of the proteins involved in iron homeostasis , but not related to iron deficiency or overload [ 116 – 118 ] . Genetic analysis of iron deficiency in mice has been evaluated [ 119 ] . This study re - vealed that polymorphisms in multiple genes cause individual variations in iron regulation , especially in response to dietary iron challenge . In humans , genome - wide association studies found linkage of various gene polymorphism ( single nucle - otide polymorphism ; SNP ) and iron status , notably polymor - phism of the gene coding for Mt2 [ 56 , 120 – 123 ] . Other investi - gators showed an association between Mt2 polymorphism and the risk to develop type 2 diabetes [ 52 ] . The authors observed that individuals homozygous for iron - lowering alleles of Mt2 had a reduced risk of iron overload and of type 2 diabetes . In a genome - wide association study looking at heme iron uptake polymorphisms , no significant association with type 2 diabetes and iron metabolic pathways were identified [ 124 ] . An et al . [ 125 ] presented evidence that genetic polymorphism of the Mt2 gene is associated with the risk to develop iron deficiency References 1 Guyatt GH , Oxman AD , Ali M , Willan A , McIlroy W , Patterson C : Laboratory diagnosis of iron - defi - ciency anemia : an overview .
