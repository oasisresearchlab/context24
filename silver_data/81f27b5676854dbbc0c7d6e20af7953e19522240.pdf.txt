Goode 2 & Jeff Gelles 1 Precise control of actin ﬁlament length is essential to many cellular processes . Formins processively elongate ﬁlaments , whereas capping protein ( CP ) binds to barbed ends and arrests polymerization . While genetic and biochemical evidence has indicated that these two proteins function antagonistically , the mechanism underlying the antagonism has remained unresolved . Here we use multi - wavelength single - molecule ﬂuorescence microscopy to observe the fully reversible formation of a long - lived ‘decision complex’ in which a CP dimer and a dimer of the formin mDia1 simultaneously bind the barbed end . Further , mDia1 displaced from the barbed end by CP can randomly slide along the ﬁlament and later return to the barbed end to re - form the complex . Quantitative kinetic analysis reveals that the CP - mDia1 antagonism that we observe in vitro occurs through the decision complex .

A ctin ﬁlaments form architecturally and functionally diverse structures inside cells , and many of these structures have characteristic ﬁlament lengths 1 . It is clear that the polymerization of actin into ﬁlamentous networks is tightly regulated by numerous actin - associated proteins , some with seemingly antagonistic activities . In some cases cooperation among these proteins can provide new levels of regulatory control over the construction of actin networks 2 . One factor that contributes to limiting actin ﬁlament elongation and thus length in cells is capping protein ( CP ) . CP is present at m M concentrations in most cells , comparable to the concentration of ﬁlament barbed ends , and binds with high afﬁnity to barbed ends ( 100 pM ) and arrests dynamics ( reviewed in ref . 3 ) . As such , CP is a key component in the dendritic actin assembly model of lamellipodial - based cellular locomotion , and is necessary for a wide range of cellular and physiological processes that depend on actin dynamics 3 , 4 . In addition , CP is a prominent component of the Z lines of sarcomeres , where it helps to capture and anchor ﬁlament barbed ends . Interestingly , at least four different formins ( see below ) have also been localized to the Z lines 5 – 7 . The dynamics - arresting action of CP can be counteracted by barbed end - associated proteins such as formins and Ena / VASP , which at once prevent CP binding while still allowing elongation 2 , 8 – 10 . Among the 15 different formins expressed in mammals , mDia1 is one of the most well - studied and is notable for the very fast rates of ﬁlament polymerization it facilitates , accelerating elongation by at least ﬁvefold in the presence of proﬁlin 11 , 12 . Single - molecule ﬂuorescence experiments show that a single formin molecule can remain associated with the barbed end for minutes while it grows 13 , 14 . This persistent association by formins with the barbed ends of elongating ﬁlaments has led to the view that formins protect growing ﬁlament ends from CP , thus allowing growth even at the high concentrations of CP possible in cells 15 – 18 . Further , this view is supported by genetic observations suggesting that CP and formins counterbalance each other’s activities in vivo 17 , 19 , 20 . Until now , the mechanism underlying this antagonism between formins and CP , and precisely how it inﬂuences actin ﬁlament dynamics , has gone unresolved . Most biochemical evidence to date has been interpreted to suggest that a formin must dissociate from the barbed end of a ﬁlament before CP can bind and cap the ﬁlament 15 , 16 , 18 , but alternative interpretations are possible . Here we labelled mDia1 and CP each with a different colour ﬂuorescent dye and used multi - wavelength single - molecule ﬂuorescence methods 21 , 22 to directly and simultaneously observe the dynamic interactions of the labelled proteins with individual actin ﬁlament barbed ends . The antagonistic regulation of barbed - end growth by CP and mDia1 occurred exclusively through the reversible formation of a long - lived ‘decision complex’ intermediate , in which CP and mDia1 were simultaneously present at the barbed end . Through the decision complex , CP could displace mDia1 from the barbed end . Further , displaced Dia1 could randomly slide along the actin ﬁlament and could later re - form the decision complex , in some cases leading to CP displacement and resumed barbed - end growth . Taken together , our results quantitatively deﬁne the kinetic mechanism of mDia1 / CP associative competition and give new insights into how actin ﬁlament length and positioning may be controlled in vivo . Results CP arrest of mDia1 - mediated actin polymerization . To begin investigating the mechanism of antagonism between CP and formins , we asked whether CP interferes with the elongation of mDia1 - capped ﬁlaments by monitoring the rate of pyrene – actin incorporation into ﬁlaments previously nucleated by mDia1 . The mDia1 construct used contains the formin homology 1 ( FH1 ) domain through the C terminus and is constitutively active for ﬁlament nucleation and processive elongation 14 . In the presence of proﬁlin , nucleation is almost completely mDia1 dependent ( Fig . 1a , 0 – 100 s , red versus black curve ) , and essentially all ﬁlaments formed under these conditions are expected to retain mDia1 at their ends 12 , 23 . When CP was added to the growing ﬁlaments at a later time point , the rate of polymerization declined ( Fig . 1a , 125 – 1 , 000 s ) , with both the magnitude and the rate of the decline increasing at increasing CP concentrations . These data suggest that CP can arrest the polymerization of ﬁlaments previously initiated by mDia1 . Only B 0 . 1 nM CP is required to inhibit polymerization or depolymerization of uncomplexed actin ﬁlaments 24 , 25 . By contrast , the concentration of CP required in our experiments for half - maximal inhibition of the growth of formin - initiated ﬁlaments was roughly 100 - fold higher ( Fig . 1b ) . This is consistent with previous proposals 16 – 18 , 26 that formins protect barbed ends from CP , but suggests that this protection is only partial , in that growth of ﬁlaments nucleated and elongated by formins is stopped at high CP concentrations . b a F l uo r e sc en c e i n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) R a t e ( + C P ) / r a t e ( – C P ) Time ( s ) [ CP ] ( nM ) 5 10 15 20 0 0 200 400 600 800 1 , 000 1 , 200 0 0 1 , 000 22 500 2 25 2 . 5 2 2 mDia1 ( nM ) CP ( nM ) 0 1 , 400 1 , 600 1 , 000 800 600 400 200 0 0 – 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 Figure 1 | mDia1 - mediated actin assembly is antagonized by introduction of CP .

All rights reserved . Oligomeric state of mDia1 on growing ﬁlament ends . To further elucidate the mechanism of CP / mDia1 antagonism , we ﬁrst deﬁned the oligomeric state of mDia1 as it processively elongates a growing ﬁlament . mDia1 is a dimer in solution before it binds to ﬁlaments 2 , 14 – 16 and it has been hypothesized to retain a dimeric state on ﬁlament ends 2 , 13 , 15 , 27 , 28 , but that has never been demonstrated . We characterized the oligomeric state of mDia1 on growing ﬁlament end in three - colour single - molecule ﬂuorescence experiments . We ﬁrst prepared SNAP - mDia1 , a SNAP - tagged 29 construct that is a dimer in solution like native mDia1 and assembles ﬁlaments in vitro with kinetics essentially identical to the corresponding mDia1 fragment 14 . We reacted the SNAP - mDia1 with an equimolar mixture of the benzylguanine adducts of green - excited and red - excited ﬂuorescent dyes , yielding a statistical mixture of green ( 549 - mDia1 ) and red ( 649 - mDia1 ) subunits in the formin dimers . On incubation with blue - excited AF488 actin , the dual - labelled formin preparation was observed in total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to nucleate actin ﬁlaments that grew while ﬂuorescent formin molecules remained processively associated with their barbed ends ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Movie 1 ) . In addition to barbed ends containing only red or only green formin subunits , some ends with both red and green were observed ( Fig . 2b ) , suggesting that these ends were being elongated by a molecule containing at least two mDia1 subunits . The colours present at an end did not change during observation ( typically B 1 min per end ) suggesting that formin subunits did not exchange with others from solution at the sub - nM concentrations used . Counts of the numbers of growing ﬁlament ends with ﬂuorescence from only red , only green or both red and green subunits were far more consistent with the hypothesis that a formin dimer is the active species that catalyses elongation than they were with monomer , trimer or tetramer models ( Fig . 2b ) . The presence of a kinetically stable formin dimer at the barbed end is consistent with proposed dimer ‘stair - stepping’ models for formin function in actin ﬁlament elongation 15 , 27 . Formation of an mDia1 / CP / barbed - end complex . Next , we proceeded to use the same three - colour TIRF methodology to observe the interactions of ﬁlament ends with single molecules of both mDia1 and CP . For these experiments , we puriﬁed CP heterodimer with a SNAP tag fused to the N terminus of the b 2 subunit and ﬂuorescently labelled it . The resultant 649 - CP , like wild - type CP , quickly arrests actin ﬁlament elongation by binding to barbed ends ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . To simultaneously monitor mDia1 and CP interactions with ﬁlament barbed ends , actin ﬁlaments were grown in the presence of 50 pM 549 - mDia1 and 3 m M proﬁlin in the presence or absence of 649 - CP . As we previously reported 14 , in the absence of CP single molecules of mDia1 remained associated with the barbed ends as ﬁlament growth continued ( Supplementary Movie 2 ) . Typically , ﬁlaments were observed to grow continuously until they exited the microscope ﬁeld of view . In contrast , when 649 - CP ( at concentrations of 3 – 12 nM ) was added to the reaction , we frequently observed ﬁlaments initially growing with 549 - Dia1 at the barbed end and then being converted into non - growing ﬁlaments with 649 - CP at the end ( Supplementary Movies 3 and 4 ) , consistent with the behaviour seen in bulk ( Fig . 1 ) . Signiﬁcantly , the transition from a growing , mDia1 - associated end to a non - growing CP - associated end proceeded through a characteristic sequence of events . We never ( 0 % of N ¼ 40 mDia1 - bound barbed ends ) observed 549 - mDia1 dissociation followed by continuing ﬁlament growth and subsequent 649 - CP binding . Instead , we almost always ( 93 % ) saw that capping occurred through the formation of an unexpected long - lived ternary complex between 549 - mDia1 , 649 - CP and the barbed end ( Fig . 3a , b and Supplementary Movies 3 and 4 ) . ( In the remaining 7 % of events , the transition of the barbed end from 549 - mDia1 bound to 649 - CP bound happened too quickly to discern the order of the dissociation and binding events . ) The high proportion of events in which CP was observed to bind before departure of mDia1 from the barbed end suggested that CP usually or always acts on barbed ends being elongated by mDia1 through an ‘associative competition’ mechanism ( Fig . 3c , bottom ) , rather than the long - presumed dissociative mechanism ( Fig . 3c , top ) . Differentiating between these two mechanisms is critical , because they have profoundly different implications for cellular function , including the duration of formin ‘runs’ on ﬁlament ends , the regulation of ﬁlament length distribution in actin networks and the ability of localized CP to capture the barbed ends of growing ﬁlaments ( see Discussion ) . We next examined actin polymerization at barbed ends with bound mDia1 and CP .

Occasionally , a 549 - mDia1 - terminated ﬁlament was observed to grow con - tinuously and then stop , possibly due to photodamage . In contrast , during periods in which both 549 - mDia1 and 649 - CP were observed on the barbed end , the ﬁlament growth rate was uniformly zero within experimental uncertainty ( Fig . 3e ) , and as expected , barbed ends with 649 - CP alone did not grow . Thus , bound CP halts subunit exchange at barbed ends whether or not mDia1 is simultaneously present . Similar results were obtained for another ﬂuorescently labelled formin , human DAAM1 ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , showing that these phenomena are not conﬁned to mDia1 . Control experiments showed that formation of the mDia1 / CP / barbed - end complex was not an artefact of protein tagging and / or labelling ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Fates of the mDia1 / CP / barbed - end complex . In somewhat less than half ( 39 % ; 67 of 171 ) of the mDia1 / CP / barbed - end complexes , we observed the ﬁlament end eventually lose 549 - mDia1 ﬂuorescence , yielding a 649 - CP - capped ﬁlament that never resumed growth ( examples in Fig . 3b , e , top ) . Loss of ﬂuorescence was typically abrupt ( Fig . 3b at 400 s ) and the lifetime of 549 - mDia1 ﬂuorescence in the complexes was largely invariant to changes in laser exposure of the 549 dye ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . Thus , loss of ﬂuorescence was caused in nearly all cases by dissociation of 549 - mDia1 from the barbed end rather than by photobleaching . For other complexes ( 30 % ; 51 of 171 ; Fig . 3e , bottom ) , the simultaneous residence of 549 - mDia1 and 649 - CP ( at the barbed end ) ended with the disappearance of the 649 - CP spot . In 21 of a sample of 22 649 - CP loss events analysed in detail , ﬂuorescence disappeared in a single abrupt step ( for example , Supplementary Fig . 5 ) , and 549 - mDia1 ﬂuorescence duration in complexes was essentially independent of laser exposure ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . Since CP was labelled on only one subunit , this suggests that the complex contains a single CP heterodimer and that ﬂuorescence loss reports dissociation of the dimer from the complex rather than photobleaching . Most often ( 66 % ; 24 of 36 measurable ) , ﬁlament polymerization resumed immediately after 649 - CP departure ( for example , Supplementary Movie 5 ) . In a minority of cases ( 34 % ) growth did not resume , possibly because of actin photodamage 30 . Taken together , our observations suggest that the mDia1 / CP / barbed - end complex contains one mDia1 dimer and one CP dimer , and show that it is resolved by either mDia1 leaving , which yields a capped end , or CP leaving , which most often yields an mDia1 - associated polymerizing end . We therefore term the complex the ‘decision complex’ because it represents a decision point from which the ﬁlament either resumes growth or becomes conventionally capped .

When 549 - mDia1 molecules dissociated from the decision complex , they often disappeared in a time r 0 . 5 s , the duration of a single video frame , consistent with release into solution and expected rapid diffusion out of the evanescent ﬁeld of the TIRF microscope . However , in a signiﬁcant fraction of the 549 - mDia1 dissociation events ( 43 % of N ¼ 63 measurable ) , the molecule did not disappear from the image , and instead was observed to slide along the ﬁlament ( Fig . 4a – c and Supplementary Movie 6 ) . Such sliding has not been observed previously for mDia1 , but was reported for another formin , DAAM1 ( ref . 31 ) . The sliding motions were bidirectional , and had the characteristics of a one - dimensional random walk along the ﬁlament ( Fig . 4d ) . The apparent diffusion coefﬁcient ( Fig . 4d ) was B 100 - fold lower than that calculated from a barrier - less helical diffusion model ( described in ref . 32 and based on a model in which mDia1 is centred at a radial position 7 . 7 nm from the ﬁlament axis ) , indicating that the observed motion is consistent with either helical or linear sliding and that there is a small but signiﬁcant energy barrier for the sliding mDia1 molecule to move from one position to the next on the ﬁlament lattice . Two different fates were observed for sliding 549 - mDia1 molecules . In some cases , the sliding 549 - mDia1 was observed to eventually disappear from the side of the ﬁlament due to dissociation ( or possibly photochemical or chemical bleaching ) , leaving behind a ﬁlament with a CP - capped barbed end ( Fig . 4c ) . In other cases , 549 - mDia1 diffused back to the barbed end and re - formed the decision complex , which sometimes led to dissocia - tion of 649 - CP and resumed ﬁlament elongation ( Fig . 4a , b ) . These observations clearly demonstrate that a substantial fraction of mDia1 molecules enter the sliding state on leaving the ﬁlament barbed end ( the observed 43 % is likely an underestimate of this fraction since very short sliding episodes would not be detected ) . The data also show that when present on a capped ﬁlament , a sliding mDia1 molecule can re - form the decision complex and reverse capping . Dynamics of associative competition . To more fully understand the nature of the decision complex , we investigated its kinetic behaviour . The N ¼ 171 complexes we observed had an expo - nential lifetime distribution ( Fig . 5a ) . The mean lifetime of the decision complexes that ended by CP dissociation ( 199 ± 36 s ( s . e . m . ) ; N ¼ 51 ) was the same within experimental uncertainty as those that ended by mDia1 dissociation ( 171 ± 24 s ; N ¼ 67 ) . These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the same , single decision complex species produces both outcomes . This model is corroborated by our observations that mDia1 could return to a 649 - CP - capped barbed end ( thus re - forming the decision complex ) , wait for 649 - CP to dissociate , and then recommence elongation ( Fig . 4a , b and Supplementary Movie 6 ) . These observations show that the formation of the decision complex can occur from either direction . Thus , multiple lines of evidence suggest that the decision complex is the single kinetically signiﬁcant intermediate in the CP / mDia1 antagonism mechanism , can be formed by starting from either a CP - capped , static barbed end or an mDia1 - bound , growing barbed end , and can yield either of these barbed - end complexes as an outcome ( Fig . 5b , magenta ) . b a c d AF488 actin 549 - mDia1 649 - CP Time ( s ) Time ( s ) Δ t ( s ) M e an s qua r e d i s p l a c e m en t ( μ m 2 ) P o s i t i on ( μ m ) P o s i t i on ( μ m ) 44 40 36 32 28 0 40 80 380 420 0 50 100 150 20 25 30 35 1 2 3 4 5 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 20 60 400 440 25 s 55 s 100 s 435 s Barbed end 549 - mDia1 649 - CP Barbed end 549 - mDia1 649 - CP D 1D , mDia1 = 0 . 029 ± 0 . 001 μ m 2 s – 1 Figure 4 | Sliding of mDia1 molecules along actin ﬁlaments in the presence of 649 - CP ( N ¼ 63 sliding events observed ) .

The single - molecule measurements directly yield rate constants ( Fig . 5b ) that predict CP inhibition of mDia1 - mediated ﬁlament elongation similar to that observed in bulk and that quantitatively deﬁne the associative competition process ( see Methods ) . Binding of 649 - CP to 549 - mDia1 - bound ends was 4 20 - fold slower than to barbed ends without formin ( k 1 0 versus k 1 in Fig . 5b ) showing that mDia1 markedly protects barbed ends from CP binding , but does not prevent it altogether . The analysis also shows that CP kinetically destabilizes mDia1 binding to the barbed end : unambiguous dissociation of mDia1 from the decision complex was observed frequently ( for example , Fig . 4 ) and was at least sevenfold faster than its dissociation from a barbed end where mDia1 alone was present ( k 2 0 versus k 2 in Fig . 5b ) . Finally , the kinetic analysis predicts that associative competition is likely to be the dominant pathway over dissociative competition . The estimated total concentration of CP in cells is B 1 m M ( ref . 3 ) , although the free concentration may be lower 33 . At this concentration , the rate at which an mDia1 elongating ﬁlament would be capped through the associative pathway is calculated to be 0 . 0014 s (cid:2) 1 ( see Methods ) . This is sevenfold or more higher than the rate of capping predicted for the dissociative pathway , which is presumably limited by the rate of spontaneous mDia1 dissociation ( k 2 in Fig . 5b ) . Discussion It has long been established from biochemical and genetic studies that formins and CP have antagonistic activities on actin ﬁlament barbed ends 16 – 20 , 26 , 34 . In these studies , it has been assumed that the underlying mechanism is one of dissociative competition ( Fig . 3c ) . Here we made direct , simultaneous single - molecule observations of mDia1 and CP dynamic interactions with barbed ends , revealing the decision complex , a heretofore unknown intermediate that mediates competition for the barbed end by mDia1 and CP . The resultant associative competition mechanism and the role played by formin molecules sliding along the actin ﬁlament represent new processes by which cells may regulate formin occupancy of barbed ends and thereby contribute to control of actin ﬁlament growth rates , length distributions and barbed - end capture . One major consequence of the decision complex - mediated ﬁlament length regulation mechanism is that it explains a way in which highly processive formins can be attenuated to produce ﬁlaments of the lengths seen in cells . In vitro , formins by themselves can ride the growing ends of ﬁlaments for minutes , leading to the growth of ﬁlaments hundreds of micrometers in length 12 , 14 . We show that physiological concentrations of CP could accelerate the dissociation of mDia1 by sevenfold or more through decision complex formation , which would lead to the production of shorter actin ﬁlaments as typically observed in cells . Of course , other processes ( for example , ﬁlament severing ) also are likely to play a signiﬁcant role in decreasing the lengths of actin ﬁlaments in vivo . In the previously assumed dissociative competition mechanism , ﬁlament length depends only on formin processivity and polymerization rate . The associative competition mechanism establishes a means by which cells can locally tune the lengths of ﬁlaments in their actin arrays by controlling the levels of active CP . This is signiﬁcant because CP is non - uniformly distributed in cells ; furthermore , its activity can be locally regulated by phosphoinositides and modulated by speciﬁc CP - binding proteins 3 , 33 , 35 – 37 . Also of potential signiﬁcance to our understanding of actin network dynamics in vivo is the observation that CP termination Decisioncomplex Capped filament Capped filament with sliding mDia1 mDia1 only CP only CP and mDia1 k 1 ′ k – 1 ′ k 2 ′ k 1 k – 1 a k 2 b Decision complex lifetime ( s ) 0 500 1 , 500 2 , 500 1 , 000 2 , 000 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 F r a c t i on o f de c i s i on c o m p l e x e s k 1 or k 1 ′ ( M – 1 s – 1 ) k – 1 or k – 1 ′ ( s – 1 ) k 2 or k 2 ′ ( s – 1 ) CP only a 63±4 × 10 5 0 . 5±0 . 1 × 10 – 3 mDia1 only b ≤ 0 . 2±0 . 2 × 10 – 3 CP and mDia1 b 2 . 9±0 . 5 × 10 5 1 . 1±0 . 5 × 10 – 3 1 . 4±0 . 3 × 10 – 3 a From ref . 24 b From this study Figure 5 | Decision complex kinetics and mechanism . ( a ) Cumulative lifetime distribution of decision complexes containing 549 - mDia1 and 649 - CP ( black ; N ¼ 171 ) , and a maximum likelihood ﬁt ( see Methods ) of the measured lifetimes to a single - species ( exponential ) kinetic model ( red ; shading indicates 95 % CI ) . Fit yielded a characteristic lifetime m ¼ 359s ( s . e . : 41s ; 95 % CI : 290 – 448s ) ; this quantity includes contributions from both 549 - mDia1 and 649 - CP dissociation and from photobleaching of both dyes . ( b ) Deduced kinetic schemes and rate constants ( ± s . e . ) for the interaction of actin ﬁlament barbed ends with CP only ( red box ) , mDia1 only ( green box ) or both ( magenta box ) . Green and red arrows mark structures that can or cannot , respectively , add actin monomers to the ﬁlament end . Values of k (cid:2) 1 0 and k 2 0 are corrected for dye photobleaching ( see Methods ) . The value of k 2 is not corrected for photobleaching ; it is an estimated upper limit since only a single 549 - mDia1 disappearance event was observed , and this may have been caused by photobleaching rather than dissociation .

This provides a possible mechanism by which cells could restart ﬁlament growth in response to speciﬁc cues . In addition , the ability of the released mDia1 molecule to slide along the ﬁlament and to subsequently re - form a decision complex with CP at the barbed end implies a feedback mechanism that responds to ﬁlament length : assuming a constant probability of dissociation from the ﬁlament side , a shorter ﬁlament will have a higher probability of formin recapture at the barbed end . This will lead to preferential resumption of growth by shorter ﬁlaments , yielding a more uniform distribution of ﬁlament lengths . This is reminiscent of feedback mechanisms previously proposed to control microtubule length by kinesins 38 , 39 . Of particular signiﬁcance , the decision complex provides a mechanism by which CP that is anchored at speciﬁc cellular locations might capture ﬁlament barbed ends being elongated by formins , imposing precise yet dynamic control of ﬁlament length and position . In fact , CP and formins colocalize at many of the same cellular structures that capture ﬁlament barbed ends ( for example , ﬁlopodial tips and sarcomeric Z disks ) 3 , 5 , 6 , 40 , 41 . While our observations have deﬁned both the stoichiometry and the dynamic behaviour of the decision complex , its three - dimensional structure has yet to be determined . Formins processively elongate ﬁlaments via a stair - stepping mechanism in which the two halves of the formin dimer alternately block both protoﬁlament ends ( ‘closed’ conformations ( s ) ) or only a single protoﬁlament end , leaving the other exposed ( ‘open’ conformation ) 2 . For this reason , it is tempting to speculate that the decision complex has a ‘foot in the door’ structure in which the formin blocks only one protoﬁlament end ( as in the open conformation ) and that the other protoﬁlament end is occupied by one of the two CP subunits . This interpretation is consistent with our observations that the decision complex is less kinetically stable than the complexes made by either protein alone with the barbed end . Methods Protein puriﬁcation and labelling . mDia1 ( ref . 26 ) , SNAP - mDia1 ( ref . 14 ) , SNAP - DAAM1 ( ref . 31 ) , rabbit muscle actin 42 , CapZ 43 and human proﬁlin 15 were puriﬁed as described . Both mDia1 and SNAP - mDia1 constructs consist of the FH1 , FH2 and C - terminal domains 14 , 26 . Pyrene - labelled 44 and Alexa Fluor 488 - labelled rabbit muscle actin 45 were prepared as described . SNAP - mDia1 was labelled during puriﬁcation as described 14 using SNAP - surface - 549 ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) either by itself or together with an analogous benzylguanine derivative of Dyomics 649 ( Dyomics , Jena , Germany ) , yielding 549 - mDia1 and 649 - mDia1 subunits , respectively . Benzylguanine dye adducts were reacted with protein in 2 . 5 – 5 . 0 adduct : protein mole ratios ( 15 – 30 m M adduct ) . Labelling stoichiometries of the 549 - mDia1 and 549 - mDia1 / 649 - mDia1 were calculated from the dye absorbance in the labelled protein preparations ( using e 549 ¼ 2 . 5 (cid:3) 10 5 M (cid:2) 1 cm (cid:2) 1 and e 649 ¼ 0 for the 549 dye , and e 549 ¼ 8 . 5 (cid:3) 10 3 M (cid:2) 1 cm (cid:2) 1 and e 649 ¼ 1 . 5 (cid:3) 10 5 M (cid:2) 1 cm (cid:2) 1 for the 649 dye ) and protein concentrations measured by densitometry of Coomassie Blue - stained SDS – PAGE gels using BSA as a standard . Measured labelling stoichiometries were 0 . 79mol dye per mol protein monomer for 549 - mDia1 ( ref . 14 ) and 0 . 39 / 0 . 17 for 549 - mDia1 / 649 - mDia1 . For storage , labelled formin and capping protein preparations were frozen with liquid N 2 in HEK buffer ( 20mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 1mM EDTA and 150mM KCl ) supplemented with 1mgml (cid:2) 1 BSA and 10 % glycerol and stored at (cid:2) 80 (cid:2) C . Preparation of 649 - CP . A plasmid pSNAP - CAPZ , for simultaneous expression of a His - and SNAP - tagged b 1 subunit and untagged a 1 subunit of chicken CapZ , was derived from a plasmid for expressing the untagged subunits ( pET - 3d - b I 0 / b II in ref . 43 ) as follows : a DNA insert encoding MHHHHH , followed by the SNAP tag , followed by the linker SGSGSG was prepared by PCR ampliﬁcation from T7 ( II ) SNAP ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) using primers 5 0 - GGACCTGGA CATATGCACCACCACCACCACCACATGGCTAGCACCATGG - 3 0 and 5 0 - GAG CTCGAGCATATGGCTGCCGCTGCCGCTGCCATTAACCTCGAGCCCGGGGG - 3 0 , digested with NdeI , and then ligated to NdeI - digested pET - 3d - b I 0 / b II . Sequencing of the resulting plasmid revealed correct orientation of the insert and a single point mutation in the SNAP tag , L69Q ( T7 ( II ) SNAP numbering ) , which did not affect labelling . To express protein , pSNAP - CAPZ was transformed into BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS cells , grown at 37 (cid:2) C to OD 600 B 0 . 6 , induced with 0 . 4mM isopropyl - b - D - thiogalactoside , and grown further for 8h before collecting the cells by centrifugation . Cells were used immediately or frozen in liquid nitrogen . The SNAP - tagged CapZ was puriﬁed and labelled with a protocol similar to the one used to purify SNAP - mDia1 ( ref . 14 ) , except that the cells were lysed in the presence of 0 . 5mgml (cid:2) 1 of lysozyme , and sonicated with a probe sonicator for 3min on ice . SNAP - CapZ was ﬂuorescently labelled using a procedure analogous to that used to prepare 649 - mDia1 , except that the labelling reaction used 9 m M ( B 4 - fold excess ) dye adduct for 2h at room temperature , yielding 649 - CP . In - gel ﬂuorometry using the total dye added to the labelling reaction as an internal standard together with the measured protein concentration showed that the labelled protein contained 1 . 03mol dye per CP heterodimer . We conﬁrmed that the 649 - CP preparation was essentially 100 % dye labelled by observing capping protein binding to ﬁlaments with TIRF microscopy ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , which showed nine of nine ﬁlaments elongating before 649 - CP addition bound a 649 - CP at the time of elongation arrest . Pyrene – actin assembly assays . Pyrene – actin assembly assays were performed as previously described 20 with slight modiﬁcations . Brieﬂy , rabbit muscle actin preparations were thawed and pre - cleared in a TLA - 120 . 1 rotor ( Beckman Coulter , Indianapolis , IN ) at 90000r . p . m . for 1h before use . To make samples for the assembly assays , 2 m M 5 % pyrene - labelled rabbit muscle actin in G - buffer ( 3mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 2mM ATP , 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 and 0 . 5mM dithiothreitol ) was added to 10 (cid:3) exchange buffer ( 1mM MgCl 2 and 10mM EGTA ) , then to either HEK buffer , or proteins in HEK buffer ( 2nM mDia1 and 5 m M proﬁlin ) . This reaction was allowed to incubate for 2min , then mixed with 20 (cid:3) initiation mix ( 40mM MgCl 2 , 10mM ATP and 1M KCl ) for a ﬁnal volume of 58 m l and pipetted into a quartz microcuvette . Data were acquired on a PTI ﬂuorometer ( Photon Technologies International , Lawrenceville , NJ ) at 25 (cid:2) C , l ex ¼ 365 nm , l em ¼ 407nm . At B 100s , acquisition was paused and either 2 m l HEK buffer or the indicated concentration of CP was added to the reaction . Curve before the addition of CP ( Fig . 1a , black ) is the average of all of the pre - CP addition traces . Post - CP intensity data were offset to start at a common point . To ﬁnd the half - maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC 50 ) from the experimental pyrene – actin assembly data , assembly rates before and after the addition were measured by linear regression of the data record segments from B 60 – 100 and B 130 – 170s , respectively . Errors in the individual points ( Fig . 1b ) reﬂect the s . e . from the linear regression analysis . The ratios of these slopes were plotted and ﬁt according to 1 (cid:2) B 1 þ ½ CP (cid:4) IC 50 þ B ; where [ CP ] is the capping protein concentration and IC 50 and B are ﬁt parameters . To determine the IC 50 predicted by the associative competition kinetic model derived from the single - molecule ﬂuorescence measurements , simulated pyrene ﬂuorescence curves were constructed by numerical integration of the rate equations ( assuming a negligible concentration of free mDia1 ) and analysed using the same procedure as for the experimental pyrene ﬂuorescence records . The simulations yielded IC 50 ¼ 8 . 8 ± 3 . 6nM , indistinguishable from the experimental value IC 50 ¼ 10 ± 4nM ( Fig . 1b ) . TIRF microscopy . TIRF imaging was performed on a custom - built multi - wave - length micromirror microscope as described 21 , 45 , with the following minor changes to the slide passivation protocol , reagents and image acquisition protocol . Brieﬂy , slides were passivated with polyethylene glycol – silane ( PEG - silane ; 2kDa , 2 – 4mgml (cid:2) 1 , Laysan Bio , Arab , AL ) by reacting the microscope slide overnight with the PEG – silane in 80 % ethanol , pH 2 at 70 (cid:2) C . TIRF buffer was prepared as a stock at 2 (cid:3) the ﬁnal composition of 10mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 50mM CH 3 COOK , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA , 10mM dithiothreitol , 0 . 2mM ATP , 15mM glucose , 0 . 002mgml (cid:2) 1 catalase , 0 . 01mgml (cid:2) 1 glucose oxidase , 0 . 1 % BSA ( Calbiochem , ( Merck ) Darmstadt , Germany ) and 3 – 5 % 200kDa dextran . Proteins were individually diluted in G - buffer supplemented with 1mgml (cid:2) 1 BSA , then mixed with the 2 (cid:3) TIRF buffer and water so that the indicated ﬁnal protein concentrations were in 1 (cid:3) TIRF buffer supplemented with 0 . 5 (cid:3) G - buffer . Ten per cent AF488 - labelled actin ( 0 . 5 – 1 m M , ﬁnal ) was combined with a threefold excess of proﬁlin , 0 – 100pM of 549 - mDia1 or 549 - DAAM1 , 0 – 12nM CP or 649 - CP , and TIRF buffer , quickly mixed , then introduced into a 15 - m l ﬂow cell . Except where otherwise indicated , two images of 0 . 5s duration were collected every 5s , one with 488nm excitation ( 75 m W incident to micromirror ) and the other with simultaneous 532 and 633nm ( each 600 m W incident ) excitation . Separate sub - images were formed from emissions o 633nm and 4 633nm ( ref . 21 ) . One pixel was equivalent to 122 (cid:3) 122nm . Experiments were limited to sub - nanomolar concentrations of formins to avoid nucleation of excessive numbers of ﬁlaments . Image processing . Images recorded at different wavelengths were aligned as described 45 , 46 , converted into RGB AVI ﬁles , and imported into ImageJ ( NIH , Bethesda , MD ) . Contrast and brightness were adjusted independently for each colour . Each colour channel of images displayed in ﬁgures and Supplementary NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms9707 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 6 : 8707 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms9707 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 7 & 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . Movies was spatial ﬁltered to suppress noise ( 10 pixel rolling ball subtraction , then 3 (cid:3) 3 pixel median ﬁlter ) . Time records of ﬂuorescence intensities from ﬁlament ends were computed from each unﬁltered image as the average intensity in the 3 (cid:3) 3 pixel square centred at the end of the ﬁlament minus the average intensity in a nearby 3 (cid:3) 3 pixel background area . Single - molecule kinetic analysis . Times at which 649 - CP and 549 - mDia1 bound to ﬁlament ends were tabulated by inspection of unﬁltered movies . Apparent ﬁrst - order rate constants for association of 649 - CP to 549 - mDia1 - bound ﬁlament ends at various 649 - CP concentrations were calculated as the number of 649 - CP - binding events divided by the total time a barbed end occupied only by 549 - mDia1 was visible . A proportional ﬁt of the apparent ﬁrst - order rate constants versus concentration ( weighted by the inverse square of the standard error ) yielded the second - order rate constant k 1 0 . The association rate constant of CP to ﬁlament barbed ends not bound by formin was measured under similar conditions in ref . 24 . In the absence of CP , only a single 549 - mDia1 dissociation event was observed in 5 , 420s total observation time over 28 ﬁlaments , and even the single event may have been due to 549 - mDia1 photobleaching ( which may occur at a rate of B 10 (cid:2) 3 s (cid:2) 1 ; see Supplementary Fig . 4a ) rather than dissociation . Therefore , the reciprocal of the 5 , 400s observation time was used as the estimate the upper limit of the dissociation rate constant for mDia1 ( k 2 ) . To calculate the characteristic lifetime of the 649 - CP / mDia1 / ﬁlament end complex , we measured the lifetime t of each complex until it dissociated by loss of 649 - CP or 549 - mDia1 . Control experiments ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) showed that photobleaching did not substantially reduce the lifetime under the conditions used . For complexes that were not observed to dissociate , we separately compiled the time n that each was observed until observation was truncated by termination of the video recording , the ﬁlament end leaving the microscope ﬁeld of view or observation of the ﬁlament end being blocked by the growth of other ﬁlaments . In analysing these data , we used a modiﬁed version of the approach described in ref . 47 . Speciﬁcally , the set of individual measured lifetimes and truncated observation durations were globally ﬁt using the maximum likelihood algorithm to the probability density functions p t ð t Þ ¼ ð r (cid:2) t Þ m r e (cid:2) tm and p n ð n Þ ¼ 1 r e (cid:2) n m ; respectively , where r is the mean recording length weighted by the number of complexes observed in each recording and the ﬁt parameter m is the characteristic lifetime . Derivation of these functions is based on the approximation that t is signiﬁcantly smaller than r . This condition is satisﬁed in our data sets , where every measured t was less than r and the ( t / r ) distribution across all ﬁve experimental conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) had median 0 . 1 and 90th percentile 0 . 33 . The analytical method and its software implementation were validated using data produced by numerical simulations designed to mimic the effects of experimental data truncation . The conﬁdence intervals for the ﬁt parameter and ﬁt curves were estimated by bootstrapping . The reported mean lifetimes for complexes that terminated by 649 - CP or 549 - mDia1 are less than m because the former do not include the truncated observations ( 53 of 171 total ) . The rate constants for dissociation of the paused ﬁlament complex ( Fig . 5b , magenta ) were calculated as k 0(cid:2) 1 ¼ ð 1 (cid:2) P Þ m (cid:2) k p ; 649 - CP and k 0 2 ¼ P m (cid:2) k 0 p ; 549 - mDia1 ; where k 0 p , 549 - mDia1 and k p , 649 - CP are the measured photobleaching rates and P ¼ 0 . 568 ± 0 . 004 was the fraction ( ± s . e . ) of complexes observed to end by loss of 549 - mDia1 ﬂuorescence rather than by loss of 649 - CP ﬂuorescence . k p , 649 - CP was calculated as described ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) ; k 0 p , 549 - mDia1 was taken to be the weighted mean of k p , 549 - mDia1 ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) and k 2 ( Fig . 5b ) since the latter provides an independently measured upper limit on the 549 - mDia1 photobleaching rate . All reported uncertainties in lifetimes and rate constants are standard errors . The overall ﬂux R through the associative competition pathway ( Fig . 3c , bottom ) expected at a given concentration of capping protein [ CP ] was calculated as R ¼ k 0 1 k 0 2 CP ½ (cid:4) k 0(cid:2) 1 þ k 0 2 þ k 0 1 CP ½ (cid:4) ð Þ : References 1 .
