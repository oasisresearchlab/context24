( A ) Immunoblot analysis of Dok3 expression in lysates from purified Dok3 + / + and Dok3 - / - bone marrow cells . β - actin was used as loading control . Images are representative of three independent experiments . ( B ) Total cell counts of bone marrow ( BM ) ( n = 6 ) , spleen ( n = 9 ) and lymph nodes ( LN ) ( n = 3 ) from Dok3 + / + and Dok3 - / - mice . Data is pooled from > 3 independent experiments . Data is shown as mean±s . e . m . ( C ) Flow cytometric analysis of monocytes ( Ly6G - Ly6C + ) and neutrophils ( Ly6G + Ly6C + ) in BM and 2 spleen . Dot plots are pre - gated on singlet , live cells . Images are representative of > 5 independent experiments . ( D ) Flow cytometric analysis of macrophages ( F4 / 80 + MHC II lo / hi ) in spleen . Dot plots are pre - gated on singlet , live cells . Images are representative of 3 independent experiments . ( E ) Flow cytometric analysis of resident ( CD11c + MHC II + / lo ) and migratory ( CD11c + MHC II hi ) DCs in spleen and LNs . Dot plots are pre - gated on singlet , live cells . Images are representative of 3 independent experiments . ( F ) Flow cytometric analysis of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in LNs . Dot plots are pre - gated on singlet , live , TCR β + cells . Images are representative of 3 independent experiments . ( G ) Total number of neutrophils , monocytes , macrophages , DCs and T cells in BM , spleen and LNs of Dok3 + / + and Dok3 - / - mice ( n = 3 - 5 ) . Data is pooled from > 3 independent experiments . Data is shown as mean±s . e . m . 3 Supplemental Figure 2 . Comparable Dectin - 1 and Dectin - 2 expression on Dok3 + / + and Dok3 - / - BM neutrophils , splenic DCs and BM macrophages . ( A ) Dectin - 1 and ( B ) Dectin - 2 expression were analyzed by surface staining and flow cytometry after stimulation with zymosan ( 50µg / ml ) , HKCA in yeast ( MOI 2 : 1 ) and hyphae form ( MOI 2 : 1 ) . Histograms for neutrophils were pre - gated on singlet , live , Ly6G + Ly6C + cells . Histograms for DCs were pre - gated on singlet , live , CD11c + MHC II + cells . Histograms for macrophages were pre - gated on singlet , live , F4 / 80 + cells . Filled histograms represent isotype control . One representative out of three independent experiments is shown ( n = 3 ) . ( C ) mRNA expression level of Clec7a in purified Dok3 + / + and Dok3 - / - neutrophils with and without HKCA stimulation ( MOI 1 : 2 ) . Data is shown as mean±s . d . ( n = 3 ) . 4 Supplemental Figure 3 . Enhanced cytokines production by Dok3 - / - neutrophils . Flow cytometric analysis of indicated cytokines production by Dok3 + / + and Dok3 - / - neutrophils following zymosan stimulation . Dot plots are pre - gated on singlet , live , Ly6G + cells . One representative experiment from 3 independent experiments is shown ( n = 3 - 4 ) . 5 Supplemental Figure 4 . Quantifications of immunoblots in Figure 4 . Purified Dok3 + / + and Dok3 - / - neutrophils were stimulated for various times with zymosan ( 10µg / ml ) ( left ) or HKCA ( MOI 1 : 1 ) ( right ) . Bar graphs represent relative amounts of ( A ) p - Syk Y352 , ( B ) p - IKK α / β S176 / 180 , ( C ) p - JNK T183 / Y185 , ( D ) p - p38 T180 / Y182 and ( E ) p - Erk T202 / Y204 after normalization to total ( A ) Syk , ( B ) IKK α / β , ( C ) JNK , ( D ) p38 and ( E ) Erk respectively . Data is pooled from 3 - 4 independent experiments ( n = 3 - 4 ) . Data is shown as 6 mean±s . e . m . * p = 0 . 03 , 0 . 04 , 0 . 03 , 0 . 03 , 0 . 05 , * * p = 0 . 01 , 0 . 005 , 0 . 01 ( from left to right , top to bottom ) , unpaired two - tailed Student’s t - test . 7 Supplemental Figure 5 . Specificities of anti - Card9 antibodies . Immunoblot analysis of Card9 expression in lysates from Card9 + / + and Card9 - / - splenic cells using different clones of anti - Card9 antibodies . GAPDH was used as loading control . Images are representative of three independent experiments . 8 Supplemental Figure 6 . PKC dd d d activation in Dok3 + / + and Dok3 - / - neutrophils . Immunoblot analysis of phosphorylated PKC d ( p - PKC d Y311 ) and PKC d in purified Dok3 + / + and Dok3 - / - neutrophils stimulated for various times with zymosan ( 10µg / ml ) .
