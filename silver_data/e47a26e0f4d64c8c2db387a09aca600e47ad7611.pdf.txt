ISOLATION FROM ACANTHAMOEBA CAXTELLANII OF AN ENZYME SIMILAR TO MUSCLE MYOSIN * ( Received for publication , December 18 , 1972 ) THOMAS D . POLLARDI AND EDWARD D . KORN From the National Heart and Lung Institute , Laboratory of Biochemistry , Section on Cellular Biochemistry and Ultrastructure , Bethesda , Maryland 20014 SUMMARY An ATPase that accounts for about 0 . 3 % of the total cell protein has been isolated in 90 % purity from Acanfhamoeba castellanii . The enzyme has been identsed as a myosin - like ATPase by the following criteria . Maximal enzymatic activity occurs in the presence of EDTA and 0 . 5 M KCl , and is only 10 to 20 % as high in the presence of Ca2 + and less than 1 % in the presence of Mg2 + . The Mg2 + ATPase is activated by actin under physiological conditions and the enzyme binds to actin filaments in the absence but not in the presence of ATP . Acanthamoeba myosin shows some activity toward nucleoside triphosphates other than ATP but does not hydrolyze ADP or AMP . In contrast to myo - sins from other sources , Acanfhamoeba myosin is soluble under physiological conditions , and its partition coefficient on gel filtration suggests a native molecular weight of about 180 , 000 , which is smaller than other myosins . Several different experiments show that the isolated molecule is not formed by proteolytic cleavage of a larger native protein . The purified enzyme consists of three polypeptide chains with molecular weights of 140 , 000 , 16 , 000 , and 14 , 000 . The amino composition is remarkable for the absence of cysteine . This and the accompanying paper ( 4 ) are the first detailed re - ports on a myosin - like enzyme from the soil amoeba , Acanth - amoeba castellanii . They form part of our continuing investiga - tion of the molecular events generating the forces of ameboid movement . Although our ultimate goal is to understand move - ment at the cellular level , our immediate approach has been to purify and characterize the presumptive “motility” proteins be - cause the mechanism of movement of an intact cell is clearly too complicated to understand without extensive biochemical and physical knowledge of the molecules involved . Previous investigations in this laboratory have established the presence in Acanthamoeba of actin filaments ( 5 ) , determined * Some of the data in this paper have been published in prelimi - nary reports ( l - 3 ) . 1 Present address , Department of Anatomy , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachuset . ts 02115 . their general distribution within the cell ( 6 , 7 ) , provided evidence for the apparent association of some actin filaments with the plasma membrane ( 8 , 9 ) , and described in some detail the chemi - cal , physical , and biological properties of the pure protein ( 5 , 6 ) . Acanthamoeba actin , although not identical to muscle actin , is very similar to it in amino acid composition and general sequence ( 5 , lo ) , molecular weight ( lo ) , and ability to undergo polymeri - zation to F - actin filaments to which muscle heavy meromyosin will bind in characteristic fashion ( 6 ) and which will activate the Mg2 + ATPase of muscle heavy meromyosin ( 5 ) . We now show that Acanthamoeba also contains an enzyme that shares many of the properties of muscle myosin . Both have ATPase activity that is partially activated by Ca2 + , max - imally activated by K + in the presence of EDTA , and not ac - tivated by Mg2f ; muscle aetin strongly activates the Mg2 + ATP - ase of both enzymes ; and both enzymes bind reversibly to fila - aments of F - actin . We call the enzyme from the amoeba Acanthamoeba myosin , because it has these properties in common with muscle myosin . Other properties of the amoeba enzyme are unique among known myosins . Acanthamoeba myosin is smaller than myosins from other sources with a molecular weight of less than 200 , 000 , it probably consists of one large and two small polypeptides , and a newly discovered “cofactor” protein is required for actin to activate its Mg2f ATPase . In spite of these significant and interesting differences the properties of Acanthamoeba myosin are consistent with the proposal that it and Acanthamoeba actin act in concert with other proteins to generate force for cell motility by a mechanism that is closely related to that utilized for muscle contraction . This paper describes the purification of Acunthumoeba myosin and some of the physical , chemical , and enzymatic properties of the purified protein . The accompanying paper ( 4 ) describes the interaction of Acanthumoeba myosin with muscle F - actin and the partial purification and characterization from Acantha - moeba of a cofactor protein required for the Mg2 + ATPase of the muscle actin - Acanthumoebu myosin complex . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE Materials - Actin from the back and leg muscles of rabbits was purified free from troponin - tropomyosin using either gel filtration ( 11 ) or KC1 washes ( 12 ) . Imidazole , iodoacetamide , sodium dodecyl sulfate , ATP , ADP , ITP , and creatine phos - phate were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company .

AMP and CTP were products of P - L Biochemicals . Guanidine hy - drochloride , ammonium sulfate , and urea were the ultrapure grade from Schwarz - Mann . Other chemicals were reagent grade , and deionized water was used throughout . Culture Procedures - Acanthamoeba castellanii ( Neff strain ) was grown at 29” in 15 - liter carboys as described ( 5 ) with the following modifications which result in healthier , faster growing cells . ( a ) Stock cultures were maintained in aerated cultures tubes ( 13 ) . ( b ) Ten to twenty milliliters of stock culture were used to inoculate l - liter Fernbach culture flasks , which were aerated by shaking continuously ( 14 ) . ( c ) Single 4 - day Fern - bath cultures were used to inoculate the carboys . ( d ) The carboys were aerated with compressed air ( not oxygen as before ) and grew rapidly with a doubling time of about 15 hours . After 4 days the cells , which consisted of less than 2 % cysts , were harvested by low speed centrifugation and were washed twice with 0 . 1 M NaCI . Average yield was about 100 g / 15 liters . A TPase Assay - Measurements were made at 29” ( the optimal growth temperature of the cells ) in 1 . 0 ml containing 0 . 5 M KCI , 2 mM ATP , 10 mM imidazole chloride , pH 7 . 0 , and either 2 mu EDTA , 10 mM CaC & , or 10 mM MgC % . Activity under these conditions will be referred to as K + - EDTA ATPase , Ca2 + - ATPase , or Mg2 + ATPase , respectively . Inorganic phosphate was measured by a modification of the method of Martin and Doty ( 15 ) . The reaction was stopped and the protein pre - cipitated by adding a mixture of 2 ml of 1 : 1 2 - butanol - benzene with 0 . 5 ml of 3 N H & O4 and 4 % silicotungstic acid , and vortex - ing for about 1 s . Vortexing was repeated for 10 to 15 s after adding 0 . 2 ml of 10 % ammonium molybdate . After the phases separat , ed , 1 . 0 ml of the organic ( upper ) phase was added to 2 . 0 ml of 0 . 73 N H & O4 in ethanol . The yellow phosphomolyb - date complex was then reduced by adding 0 . 1 ml of a solution of stannous chloride prepared by diluting 1 ml of 10 % stannous chloride in 12 N HCl with 25 ml of 1 N H $ 04 . The blue color was read at 720 nm and characteristically gave an absorbance of 3 . 8 per pmole of phosphate . When the samples to be assayed contained inorganic phos - phate a radioactive assay was used . [ y - 32P ] ATP - ( New England Nuclear ) was added in trace amounts to the nonradioactive 2 mM ATP . The reaction was stopped and the phosphomolyb - date was extracted into 2 ml of isobutanol - benzene as usual . Then 0 . 2 ml of the organic phase was added to 15 ml of Aquasol ( New England Nuclear ) , and radioactivity was measured in a Beckman LS - 250 liquid scintillation spectrometer . Protein Concentration - Where possible , protein concentra - tion was estimated by the method of Lowry et al . ( 16 ) using bovine serum albumin as the standard . Alternatively , in very dilute samples of purified fractions freed of nucleotides , protein concentration was estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm , using A $ , = 6 . 5 . This approximate absorbancy was deter - mined with highly purified ( but not homogeneous ) fractions of Acanthamoeba myosin by comparing the absorbance at 280 nm with the protein concentrat . ion estimated by the Lowry reaction ( 16 ) . Gel Electrophoresis - Proteins were reduced in a solution of 5 M guanidine hydrochloride , 50 mM DTT , l and 0 . 2 M NH4HC03 , pH 8 . 0 , for 2 hours at 37” and alkylated for 15 min at 22” with 0 . 2 M recrystallized iodoacetamide at pH 8 . 0 . The reaction was stopped by adding 2 - mercaptoethanol to 2 M and the samples were then dialyzed against water and lyophilized . SDS - poly - 1 The abbreviations used are : DTT , dithiothreitol ; SDS , sodium dodecyl sulfate . acrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Fairbanks et al . ( 17 ) . Discontinuous polyacrylamide gel elec - trophoresis with 8 M urea in the gel and the sample was per - formed with the buffers described by Davis ( 18 ) but without a stacking gel . Instead , the sample was simply layered on the surface of the gel under the chamber buffer which contained no urea . The gels were stained with Coomassie blue according to Fairbanks et al . ( 17 ) . Isoelectric Focusing - Five per cent polyacrylamide gels with 8 M urea and pH 3 to 8 ampholytes ( LKB ) were prepared and run according to the procedure of Wrigley ( 19 ) . Densitometer Scans - Polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie blue were scanned at 550 nm using a gel - scanning accessory on a Beckman ACTA - III spectrophotometer . Amino Acid Analysis - Reduced and alkylated proteins were hydrolyzed at 105” in 6 N HCl for 18 hours , and the amino acid composition was determined by the single column method ( 20 ) on a Beckman 121 amino acid analyzer . The system described by Kuehl and Adelstein ( 21 ) was used for the detection of methyl - ated lysines and histidines . Column Chromatography - Column chromatography and all other steps in the purification procedure were carried out at 4” . DEAE - cellulose ( Whatman DE - 52 ) was precycled with HCl and NaOH , and deaerated , and fines were removed according to the manufa . cturer’s directions . Columns were packed using increasing pressures of nitrogen gas ( 22 ) . Hydroxylapatite was made as described by Levin ( 23 ) . There was considerable variation in the resolving power of three separate batches of hydroxylapatite made by this method . As described under “Results , ” proteins were purified by selec - tive adsorption to agarose at low ionic strength and elution with a salt gradient . For successful adsorption of the Acanthamoeba proteins , 8 % agarose ( Bio - Rad A - 1 . 5 , , 200 to 400 mesh ) was suspended in 1 . 0 M KC1 for 2 days before pouring into the column and equilibrating with starting buffer ( Fig . 3 ) . The capacity of the agarose was much less in one experiment in which the KC1 wash was omitted . When necessary , column flow was maintained with a Buchler peristaltic pump . Column effluents were monit . ored for ab - sorbance at 280 nm with an ISCO monitor . Salt gradients were made with a Buchler Varigrad using Peterson’s guidelines ( 22 ) . Salt concentrat , ions in column effluents were estimated by meas - urements of conductivity . RESULTS Identification of Myosin - like Activity in Amoeba Extracts - Cell extracts that contain F - a & in and myosin usually decrease in viscosity upon the addition of ATP , which dissociates the complex of actin and myosin , and then return to the original viscosity as the ATP is hydrolyzed ( 24 ) . Weihing and Korn ( 5 ) found this did not occur with extracts of Acanthamoeba known to contain F - actin . If myosin was present in those extracts , therefore , it must either have been in very low concentration or an atypical myosin . In either case , if a myosin - like enzyme was present it should be detectable by sensitive ATPase assays . We measured the ATPase activity of amoebae extracts in 0 . 5 M KC1 because in that solvent muscle myosin has the property unique among ATPases of being inhibited by Mg2 + and activated maximally by EDTA and partially by Ca * f . Homogenates of amoebae had considerable ATPase activity under all three assay conditions but it was readily shown that the Mg2 + ATPase and the K + - EDTA ATPase were different enzymes . Most of the Mg2fiiTPase was localized in the mitochondria , microsomes , by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 14 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 4684 TABLE I Purijication of Acanthamoeba myosin Purification of Acanthamoeba myosin from 588 g of amoebae . Details of the procedures are given in the text , Table II , and Figures 3 to 5 . SDS - gel electrophoretic analyses of the proteins at each step are shown in Figure 2 . These results are representa - tive of a typical preparation . Although there was some variation in the efficiency of each step , the final yield and specific activity of the purified enzyme was quite reproducible . In this experi - ment , the yield from the agarose column was lower and the yield from hydroxylapatite was higher than usual . Samples containing 2 . 0 and 4 . 0 pmoles per min of ATPase were removed for analysis at Steps 4 and 5 , accounting for part of the apparent losses . Total protein step Volume ml 1 .

When such high speed supernatants were fractionated by gel filtration in 0 . 5 M KC1 on Sephadex C - 200 or agarose ( Fig . l ) , the K + - EDTA ATPase eluted as a single major peak with a partition coefficient corresponding to that of a globular protein of molecular weight between 150 , 000 and 200 , 000 . Other peaks of ATPase activity were also observed on such columns : a con - sistent small peak of Ca2 + - ATPase ( Fig . 1 ) immediately pre - ceding the K + - EDTA ATPase ; and a variable peak of Ca * + - ATPase of much higher molecular weight , usually in the void volume even on 4 % agarose but having Ko Z 0 . 2 in the experi - ment reproduced in Fig . 1 . It seemed likely that these Cazf - ATPases were , at least in part , aggregated and partially dena - tured K + - EDTA ATPase because they reappeared when the K + - EDTA ATPase fraction isolated by gel filtration was re - chromatographed following ammonium sulfate fractionation , isoelectric precipitation , or prolonged storage . The Kf - EDTA ATPase peak from these gel filtration col - umns was identified as the sought for Acanthamoeba myosin by its ability to interact with purified muscle F - actin . At low ionic strength , muscle F - actin ( 1 mg per ml ) activated the Mg * + - ATPase 2 - to 6 - fold . Over 85 % of the K + - EDTA and Ca2 + - ATPase activities sedimented with the actin when the proteins from the gel filtration peak were mixed with muscle F - actin in 0 . 5 M KCl , 5 mM MgC12 , 10 InM imidazole chloride , pH 7 . 0 , and centrifuged at 140 , 000 x g for 90 min . In the presence of actin and 2 mM ATP , 90 % of the ATPase activity remained in the supernatant and the actin pellet was enzymatically inactive . 2 T . D . Pollard , R . Weihing , and E . D .

Agarose gel filtration of Acanthamoeba extract . The extract was prepared by homogenizing cells in 2 volumes of 75 mM KCl , 12 mM sodium pyrophosphate , 5 mlvI DTT , and 30 mM imidaz - ole chloride , pH 7 . 0 , and centrifuging 75 min at 40 , 060 rpm in a Beckman 40 rotor . Then 7 . 5 ml of the clear supernatant was ap - plied to a column ( 2 . 5 X 98 cm ) of Bio - Rad A - 1 . 5m ( 200 to 400 mesh ) and the column was eluted by pumped descending flow at 12 ml per hour with 0 . 5 M KCl , 1 mM DTT , and 5 mM imidazole chloride , pH 7 . 0 . Fractions of 6 . 3 ml were collected and analyzed for protein ( - - - ) and ATPase activity in the presence of K + - EDTA ( O ) , Ca * + ( 0 ) , or Mgz + ( A ) . Recoveries were 102 % for K + - EDTA ATPase and 90 % for Ca2 + - ATPase . The partition co - efficients ( KD ) of a number of protein standards are given at the top of the graph : muscle myosin ( 460 , 000 ) ) muscle heavy meromyo - sin ( 350 , 000 ) ) bovine serum albumin dimer ( 136 , 000 ) , bovine serum albumin monomer ( 68 , 000 ) ) ovalbumin ( 43 , 500 ) ) and myoglobin ( 17 , 500 ) . The void volume ( Ko = 0 ) and salt volume ( KD = 1 . 0 ) were determined by chromatographing blue dextran and ATP , respectively . All available evidence suggests that these tests are specific for myosin . There is a report ( 25 ) of other enzymes binding to actin filaments , but this binding is apparently nonspecific be - cause it occurs only at very low ionic strength . Purijication of Acanthamoeba Myosin - Standard techniques for precipitating myosin as a complex with actin which have proved useful in purifying myosin from other systems ( 24 , 26 - 28 ) did not succeed . Although it was possible to precipitate most of the K + - EDTA ATPase and Acunthmoeba actin at low ionic strength ( 0 . 05 M KCl ) at pH 6 . 4 ( but not at pH 6 . 8 or higher ) , most of the precipitated enzyme was irreversibly aggregated . Ammonium sulfate fractionation of crude extracts also caused irreversible aggregation . By the procedures out - lined in Table I , however , it was possible to prepare highly puri - fied Acanthamoeba myosin ( Fig . 2 ) . For a typical large scale preparation , 500 to 1 , 000 g of amoebae were mixed with extraction solution ( 2 ml per g ) containing 0 . 075 M KCl , 12 mM pyrophosphate , 5 mM DTT , and 30 mM imidazole chloride , pH 7 . 0 . More than 95 % of the cells were broken by rapid release from a Parr cell disruption bomb after equilibration for 5 min with Nz at 300 p . s . i . The homogenate was then centrifuged in one or more Beckman Ti - 15 zonal rotors ( used as batch rotors ) for 3 hours at 35 , 000 rpm ( 125 , 000 x g ) . The pH of the 125 , 000 x g supernatant was adjusted to 8 . 0 with a saturated solution of Tris base and dialyzed against two changes of 10 volumes of 7 . 5 mM pyrophosphate , 0 . 5 mM DTT , by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 14 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 4685 2 3 5 FIG . 2 . Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1 % SDS of the proteins at each step in the purification of Acanthamoeba myosin . The numbers of the gels correspond to the steps listed in Table 2 . GeZs 1 to 4 are 7 . 5 % acrylamide . Gel 5 is 7 . 5 % acrylamide but run at another time . Gel 6 is 9 % acrylamide . Horizontal lines mark the positions of the three Acanthamoeba myoein peptides in each gel . and 10 mM Tris Cl , pH 8 . 0 . Some material containing Ca2 + - ATPase activity usually precipitated and was removed by cen - trifugation . Without . pyrophosphate up to 70 % of the K + - EDTA ATPase precip . ilated during dialysis and could not be solubiliaed . Several different approaches to DEAELchroma - tography were tried but ncne was completely satisfactory . Con - tinuous gradient elution ( Fig . 3 ) , which ne usually used , sep - arated the enzyme frcm nucleic acids and increased its specific activity , but recovery of enzymatic activity was poor . In pre - liminary small scale experiments the use of step gradient elution gave satisfactory purification and enzyme recoveries up to 70 % . Ammonium sulfate fractionation was carried out on the en - zyme peak as eluted from the DEAE - column or after adjusting the eluate to a final concent , ration of 1 mM ATP , 1 mM MgCln , and 2 mM DTT . It . was necessary to examine all of the ammonium sulfa . te fractions between 1 . O M and 1 . 6 M for ATPase activity ( Table II ) beceuse of slight variations in the fractiona - tion pattern from preparation to preparation . The partially purified enzyme could be further purified up to 5 - fold by gel filtration on agarose in 0 . 5 M KC1 ( see Table II in the accompanying paFe : er ( 4 ) ) but we achieved better results by adsorption of the enzyme to agarose at very low ionic strength . Elution of the column with an appropriate salt gradient gave a lo - fold purification of the enzyme ( Fig . 4 ) . If the agarose col - umn was not washed with concentrated salt solutions after each run , its capacity was greatly reduced . Usually about 60 % of the enzyme was recovered from the column , and it appeared from the relatively constant specific activity across the peak and from gel electrophoresis ( Fig . 2 ) that the enzyme was ap - proaching purity at this stage . 16 I ?

Two large fractions , I ( 400 ml ) and II ( 1400 ml ) , whose Azso are shown by vertical bars , were collected during the application of the sample . The column was then eluted by a pumped flow of about 200 ml per hour with 4 . 5 liters of a linear 0 . 01 M to 0 . 25 M KC1 gradient , followed by 2 . 5 liters of a linear 0 . 25 M to 0 . 8 M KC1 gradient , all in 1 rnM DTT and 10 mM Tris chloride , pH 8 . 0 . Fractions of 25 ml were collected and analyzed for ab - sorbance at 280 nm and 260 nm and K + - EDTA ATPase . Recovery of ATPase was 53 % . Fractions 108 to 118 , which contained 28 % of the recovered ATPase , were pooled for ammonium sulfate frac - tionation . TABLE II Ammonium sulfate fractionation The fractionation was made at 4’ by adding appropriate vol - umes of saturated ammonium sulfate containing 0 . 01 M EDTA , pH 7 . 0 , to raise the ammonium sulfate concentration to the upper limit of a particular fraction .

Proteins purified through the ammonium sulfate step were dialyzed against 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT , and 2 mm Tris chloride , pH 7 . 6 , and then were applied ( in 39 . 5 ml ) to a column ( 5 X 75 cm ) of 8 % agarose ( Bio - Rad A - 1 . 5m ( 200 to 400 mesh ) ) equilibrated with the same buffer . After washing on the sample with 80 ml of starting buffer , the column was eluted with a concave KC1 gradient in the same buffer made in a 9 X lOO - ml chamber Varigrad with the following molar concentrations of KCI : 0 , 0 . 025 , 0 . 050 , 0 . 075 , 0 . 100 , 0 . 200 , 0 . 300 , 0 . 400 , 0 . 500 . This gradient was followed by unbuffered 1 . 0 M KC1 to wash the column . Downward flow of 32 ml per hour was maintained with 50 cm of hydrostatic pressure . Fractions were collected and measured for protein ( 0 ) , and K + - EDTA ATPase , expressed as pmoles per min per ml of column fraction ( 0 ) . Fifty - nine per cent of the applied K + - EDTA ATPase was recovered in the major Acanthamoeba myosin peak and the specific activity , shown in the upper part of the fig - ure , increased about lo - fold . assuming that all of the K + - EDTA ATPase activity in the ho - mogenate is Acanthamoeba myosin ( which seems justified by the data in Table I and Fig . I ) , about 0 . 3 % of the cell’s protein is Acanthamoeba myosin . In contrast , actin may account for about 10 % of the amoeba’s protein ( 3 ) so that there is a large molar excess of actin in the cell . The large amount of actin and the relatively small amount of myosin in the amoeba probably account for the difficulty in showing actomyosin - like decreases inviscosity when ATP was added to amoeba homogenates known to contain Acanthamoeba actin ( 5 ) . Stability - Acanthamoeba myosin was reasonably stable after purification through the ammonium sulfate or agarose adsorp - tion steps , retaining up to 80 % of its enzymatic act’ivity for 1 week at 4” in 0 . 1 M KCl , 1 mM CTT , and 10 InM imidazole chlo - ride , pH 7 . 0 , at a concentration of about 0 . 2 mg per ml . In contrast , Acanthamoeba myosin purified through the hydroxyl - apatite step was difficult to store and lost as much as 10 to 25a / , of its enzymatic activity per day . Attempts to concentrate the hydroxylapatite fractions by ultrafiltration on Amicon mem - branes , by vacuum dialysis , or by ammonium sulfate precipita - tion resulted in losses of enzyme as large as 50 % . Lyophilized protein could not be redissolved . Enzymatic Activity - Acanthamoeba myosin catalyzed the hydrolysis of several nucleoside triphosphates but the highest rate was obtained with ATP which is presumably its natural substrate ( Table III ) . The enzyme did not hydrolyze ADP or the several other nucleotides and related compounds that were t , ested , and ADP inhibited the hydrolysis of ATP ( Table III ) .

The NO - ml sample , containing a total of 15 . 8 pmoles per min of ATPase , and a column ( 1 . 5 X 26 cm ) of hydroxylapatite were separately equilibrated with 0 . 5 M KCl , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM phosphate , and 5 mM imidazole chloride , pH 7 . 0 . After sample application , the column was eluted by pumped flow at 30 ml per hour with a concave phos - phate gradient made with a 6 X loo - ml Varigrad chamber con - taining the following molar concentrations of potassium phos - phate , pH 7 . 0 , in the above buffer : 0 , 0 . 01 , 0 . 03 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 10 , 0 . 30 . The curves of absorbance are redrawn from the monitor record and measurements on individual fractions .

TABLE III Substrate specificity of Acanthamoeba myosin Substrate specificity of purified Acanthamoeba myosin ( 7 pg per ml ) was measured in 0 . 5 M KCl , 2 mM EDTA , and 10 mM imidazole chloride , pH 7 . 0 , at 29” .

The effect of temperature on the K + - EDTA ATPase activity is shown in Fig . 6 . For unknown reasons , the activity remained constant at temperatures about 30” which is , perhaps coin - cidentally , the maximum temperature at which the cells will grow ( 29 ) . Between 4” and 30” the energy of activation was 9 Cal per mole . The energy of activation of muscle myosin is 12 Cal per mole under these conditions ( 30 ) .

TABLE IV Effect of ions on ATPase activity of Acanthamoeba myosin Acanthamoeba myosin was purified by step elution from DEAE - cellulose , ammonium sulfate fractionation , gel filtration , and hydroxylapatite chromatography .

In the presence of EDTA , ATPase activity was dependent on K + , partial activity was retained in the presence of Caz + , and the enzyme was strongly inhibited by Mg” + . Criteria of Purity and Subunit Composition - The ultraviolet absorption spectrum of the purified enzyme had a maximum at 278 nm and a shoulder at 290 nm . The ration Azso : A260 was about 1 . 7 , indicating little or no contamination by nucleic acid . The high , constant specific activity ( 3 to 4 pmoles per nun per mg of protein ) across the peak eluted from hydroxylapatite ( Fig . 5 ) indicated a high degree of purity , but better estimates of the purity of the enzyme were obtained by gel electrophoresis . Electrophoresis of purified Acanthumoeba myosin in the presence of either SDS ( Fig . 2 ) or urea revealed only one slow moving polypeptide and two fast moving polypeptides . There were other minor bands but they were variable in amount and ac - counted for less than 10 % of the stained proteins in most prep - arations . Isoelectric focusing in gels containing 8 M urea gave similar results of one major band ( which concentrated at about RELATIVE MOBILITY FIG . 7 . Comparison of the light chains of Acanthamoeba myosin and muscle myosin by SDS gel electrophoresis .

A , purified Acanthamoeba myosin ; B , muscle myosin ; and C , Acanthumoeba myosin mixed with muscle myosin . For these gels the Acanthumoeba myosin consisted of equal portions of three separate preparations of Acanthamoeba myosin mixed together . The heavy chains are off scale at the left . The Acanthamoeba myosin light chains are labeled AM k - 1 and AM k - 2 . The muscle myosin light chains are labeled A - l , DTNB , and A - B according to the nomenclature of Weeds and Lowey ( 33 ) . It is clear the AM k - 1 and A - 9 are not separable electrophoretically . pH 8 ) and two less intense bands ( that concentrated at much lower pII levels ) . The following observations suggest that all three polypeptides were , indeed , subunits of Acunthamoeba myosin . The three polypeptides copurified with the enzymatic activity as shown by gel electrophoresis in SDS ( Fig . 2 ) and 8 M urea ( not illus - trated ) . Despite the approximately IO - fold difference in their molecular weight , the three polypeptides remained together after gel filtration on 801 , agarose in 0 . 5 M KCl . The subunit composition was very reproducible . When equal portions of three different preparations of purified Acanthumoeba myosin were mixed and subjected to SDS - gel electrophoresis the same three bands were seen ( Fig . 7A ) in the same positions and rela - tive concentrations as with the individual preparations ( Fig . 2 ) . By analogy with the nomenclature employed for similar poly - peptide subunits of muscle myosin the slowly migrating poly - peptide will be referred to as the heavy chain and the rapidly migrating polypeptides as light chains , lc - 1 and lc - 2 . In addi - tion to their much lower molecular weight , lc - 1 and lc - 2 are much more acidic than the heavy peptide as shown by isoelectric fo - cussing and by gel electrophoresis in urea . Molecular Weight of Acanthamoeba Myosin - The heavy chains of five preparations of purified Acanthamoeba myosin had a reproducible molecular weight of 140 , 000 by SDS - gel electro - phoresis . For unexplained reasons , the heavy chains of two earlier preparations had molecular weights of 115 , 000 and 120 , 000 ( 2 ) . Acanthumoeba myosin lc - 1 co - migrated with the smallest light chain ( A - 2 ) of muscle myosin ( Fig . 7 ) , which has a mo - lecular weight of about 16 , 000 to 17 , 000 ( 33 ) . The molecular weight of Acanthamoeba myosin lc - 2 was about 14 , 000 . by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 14 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 4688 Native Acanthumceba myosin had the partition coefficient of a globular protein of molecular weight between 150 , 000 and 200 , 000 as judged by gel filtration in 0 . 5 M KC1 on 8 % agarose ( Bio - Rad A - l . 5 , Fig . l ) , 6 % agarose ( Sephadex 6B ) , 4 % agarose ( Sephadex 4B ) , ( 3 ) ( Fig . 4 ) , Sephadex G - 150 ( 4 ) ( Fig . 4 ) , and Sephadex G - 200 . Although the enzyme does adsorb to Bio - Rad agarose at low ionic strength , these estimates of molecular weight ale probably reliable ( i . e . , not influenced by adsorption ) because such binding should be minimal in 0 . 5 M KC1 and because the same results were found with Sephadex columns to which the enzyme does not adsorb even at low ionic strength . On this basis the native Acunthamoeba myosin would consist of a single heavy chain and one or more of the light chains . The native molecule must be relatively globular since an asymmetric mole - cule containing a polypeptide of 140 , 000 would have had much smaller partition coefficients than were observed . Because the molecular weight of Acanthumoeba myosin was found to be considerably less than the molecular weight of mus - cle myosin ( about 460 , 000 ( 43 ) ) , slime mold myosin ( about 460 , 000 ( 35 ) ) and platelet myosin ( about 500 , 000 ( 36 , 37 ) ) , the possibility was considered that the isolated Acunthamoebu “my - osin” might have been a proteolytic fragment of a larger native molecule . The following observations make this unlikely . The yield of K + - EDTA ATPase and its partition coefficient by gel filtration were unchanged when an amoeba homogenate was allowed to stand at 0” for 0 , 2 , and 4 hours before preparing the active supernatant by ultracentrifugation . Even very minor peaks of K + - EDTA ATPase activity corresponding to a hy - pot . hetical larger native myosin were never seen on gel filtration of crude extracts ( Fig . 1 ) . There was no increase of ninhydrin - reactive material during the extraction and centrifugation of the amoeba homogenate indicating the absence of detectable proteolysis . Addition to the extraction solution of 5 . 4 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate , and inhibitor of some proteases , did not affect the yield or partition coefficient of the Acunthu - moebu myosin . SDS - gel electrophoresis of homogenates of Acanthumoebu incubated at room temperature for as long as 4 hours revealed no detectable loss of any high molecular weight polypeptide ( 9 ) . When muscle myosin , which is highly sus - ceptible to proteolytic cleavage ( 34 ) , was incubated with an amoeba homogenate there was no decrease in muscle myosin ATPase activity nor was the molecule degraded into Subfrag - ment 1 or heavy meromyosin as judged by gel filtration . Gel electrophoresis of the purified Acunthamoeba myosin in SDS or urea consistently showed only one heavy and two light chains in contrast to the heterogeneity of heavy meromyosin and Sub - fragment 1 which are produced by multiple cleavages of muscle myosin subjected to proteases ( 33 , 38 ) . From these observa - tions it can be concluded that Acunthumoeba myosin in situ can have a higher molecular weight than the isolated enzyme only if the myosin were hydrolyzed immediately upon homogeniza - tion of the amoebae by an endogenous protease that is resistant to diisopropyl fluorophosphate and that does not attack muscle myosin or most of the other amoeba proteins . Solubility of Acunthumoebu Myosin - In contrast to myosins from the cells of higher animals , the Acanthamoeba enzyme is soluble at low ( physiological ) ionic strength . It did not pre - cipitate at pH 7 . 0 in 0 . 05 to 0 . 5 M KC1 and had the same parti - tion coefficient on Sepharose 6B in 0 . 1 M and 0 . 5 M KCl , indica - tive of no aggregation at low ionic strength . It was soluble in 0 . 2 mM ATP and 2 InM Tris chloride , pH 7 . 6 , but insoluble in 0 . 05 M KC1 below pH 6 . 5 . No recognizable aggregates or thick filaments were observed in electron micrographs of negatively TABLE V Amino acid composition of two preparations of Acanthamoeba muosin Amino acid Asp . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The apparent absence of cysteine was confirmed in two other preparations of Acanthamoeba myosin . stained preparations of Acunthumoebu myosin in 0 . 05 to 0 . 1 M KCl , even with 10 mM CaC12 which stimulates filament forma - tion by Physurum myosin ( 39 ) . Amino Acid Composition - The amino acid analysis of purified Acunthamoeba myosin was remarkable because of the absence of cysteine in each of four different preparations tested ( Table V ) . In all cases cysteine was analyzed as X - carboxymethylcysteine after reduction and alkylation of the protein . Hatano and Ohnuma ( 40 ) have reported the absence of cysteine in their preparations of Physarum myosin . Even apart from the ap - parent absence of cysteine the amino acid composition of Acun - thumoebu myosin does not resemble the amino acid composition of muscle myosin or any of its proteolytic fragments that have been analyzed ( 34 ) . No evidence was found for the presence of methylated lysines or histidine , which are constituents of some muscle myosins ( 21 ) and of Acunthumoeba actin ( 5 ) , even when very large samples were applied to the amino acid analyzer . DISCUSSION The term “myosin” was originally used to describe a group of similar , but nonidentical , ATPases found in striated and smooth muscle cells . These muscle myosins share several characteristic properties that are thought to be central to the force - generating process ( 41 ) : their ATPase activities are strongly inhibited by Mgzf but , under physiological conditions , actin activates their MgzfATPase activities ; they bind to actin filaments forming complexes that are dissociated by Mg2 + and ATP ; and , at phys - iological ionic strength , they aggregate into bipolar thick filaments which can cross - link actin filaments . Muscle myo - sins from different sources vary , however , in their specific en - zymatic activities ( 42 ) , in the number and size of their low mo - lecular weight subunits ( 43 , 44 ) , in their content of methylated amino acids ( 45 ) and in the presence or absence of Ca % ensitive regulatory activity ( 46 ) . Recently , myosins sharing many of these properties ( Table VI ) have been purified from the acellular slime mold Physurum polycephulum ( 28 , 35 , 39 , 40 ) , human platelets ( 36 , 37 ) , and by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 14 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Source of my & n Acanthamoeba Horse smooth muscle Human platelet Mouse fibroblasl t Physarum Rabbit skeletal muscle Actin binding ~ . + + + + + - I - TABLE VI Comparison of myosins from different cells Mg2 + N ATPase activity0 fg’ * + acti ] + + + + + + f + + + + K + - EDTA + + + + + + + + + + + - + + + + jubunit molecular weights 1 x 140 , 000 ?

Probably as a consequence of its low molecular weight and its globular shape , purified Acunthumoeba myosin seems unable to form filaments nor have myosin “thick filaments” been ob - served in several extensive investigations of the ultrastructure of the amoeba ( 6 , 7 ) . The absence of thick filaments makes it difficult to localize Acanthumoebu myosin within cells by electron microscopy but the fact that pyrophosphate , which dissociates myosin from actin , is required for complete extraction of the enzyme suggests that at least some of the enzyme may be bound to actin filaments in situ .
