This study sought to determine whether there are differences in the odds of household transmission for younger children compared to older children . METHODS : We assembled a cohort of all individuals in Ontario , Canada with laboratory - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection between June 1 and December 31 , 2020 . The cohort was restricted to individuals residing in private households ( N = 132 , 232 cases in 89 , 191 households ) , identified through an address matching algorithm . Analysis focused on households in which the index case was aged < 18 years . Logistic regression models were fit to estimate the association between age group of pediatric index cases ( 0 - 3 , 4 - 8 , 9 - 13 , and 14 - 17 years ) and odds of household transmission . RESULTS : A total of 6 , 280 households had pediatric index cases , and 1 , 717 ( 27 . 3 % ) experienced secondary transmission . Children aged 0 - 3 years had the highest odds of household transmission compared to children aged 14 - 17 years ( model adjusted for gender , month of disease onset , testing delay , and average family size : 1 . 43 , 95 % CI : 1 . 17 - 1 . 75 ) . This association was similarly observed in sensitivity analyses defining secondary cases as 2 - 14 days or 4 - 14 days after the index case , and stratified analyses by presence of symptoms , association with a school / childcare outbreak , or school / childcare reopening . Children aged 4 - 8 years and 9 - 13 years also had increased odds of transmission ( 4 - 8 : 1 . 40 , 95 % CI : 1 . 18 - 1 . 67 ; 9 - 13 : 1 . 13 , 95 % CI : 0 . 97 - 1 . 32 ) . CONCLUSIONS : This study suggests that younger children are more likely to transmit SARS - CoV - 2 infection compared to older children , and the highest odds of transmission was observed for children aged 0 - 3 years . Differential infectivity of pediatric age groups has implications for infection prevention controls within households , as well as schools / childcare , to minimize risk of household secondary transmission .

Early in the pandemic , when countries implemented lockdown measures , close contact was mostly limited to households and testing strategies tended to prioritize healthcare workers and symptomatic individuals . 1 – 4 As a result there were relatively few diagnosed pediatric cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) 5 and it appeared that the proportion of children involved in the transmission of infection was small . 2 , 6 , 7 Since many jurisdictions relaxed public health measures and re - opened educational facilities in the fall of 2020 , the number of pediatric COVID - 19 cases has grown , providing the opportunity to better characterize the infectivity of children . Household studies to date have typically only compared infectivity between young and old individuals , often grouping children with young adults 8 – 12 or dichotomizing age to older adults versus younger adults / children . 13 , 14 These studies have reported mixed results , with some finding that older age ( ≥ 20 years ) was associated with increased transmission 6 , 8 – 10 , 15 , 16 , one study finding younger age ( < 20 years ) 12 , and others finding no age effect . 11 , 13 – 15 , 17 – 19 Conversely , few household studies have examined differences in transmission among children 15 , 16 , 20 – 23 , likely due to insufficient sample size . 2 , 24 Two meta - analyses reported no significant differences between younger children and older children for household susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 2 , 15 , however it remains unclear if this holds true for infectivity . These findings warrant a closer look at household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 by children , and whether there are any differences in the likelihood of transmission for particular age groups . We sought to conduct an age analysis of residents aged 0 - 17 years in Ontario , Canada that were the index case of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in their household between June and December 2020 . Pediatric index cases were divided into four age groups ( 0 - 3 , 4 - 8 , 9 - 13 , and 14 - 17 years ) to provide a more granular picture of any age differences . We were also interested in comparing characteristics of index cases by age group , exploring the direction of transmission by age , and assessing whether factors such as symptoms , school / childcare reopening , or school / childcare outbreaks were associated with differences in the odds of transmission from children to their household members . .

All individuals with laboratory - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection between June 1 and December 31 , 2020 were included . We obtained ethics approval from Public Health Ontario’s Research Ethics Board . Identification of private households Addresses of all cases were reviewed and classified as either private households , defined as individual houses or apartments / suites within multi - unit dwellings , or congregate settings ( e . g . , homeless shelters or long - term care homes ) . We excluded any individuals with missing or incomplete address information , individuals residing in congregate settings , and individuals identified as residing in multi - unit dwellings but missing suite information . Addresses were then matched between cases using a natural language processing algorithm from Python’s “sklearn” library in order to identify multi - case households . Details of the address matching process have been described previously . 25 Outcomes The outcome of interest was secondary household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 infection by a pediatric index case ( aged 0 - 17 years ) . Index cases were defined as the earliest case of a household , and were identified by comparing symptom onset dates of all cases in the household . 2 If symptom onset date was missing we used specimen collection date as a proxy ; no cases were missing both dates . Secondary cases were defined as cases ( adult or pediatric ) that had disease onset 1 - 14 days after the index case , as per previous studies of household transmission . 2 , 21 , 22 , 25 We excluded households with index cases missing age ( N = 12 ) , as well as households with multiple index cases ( i . e . , multiple cases occurring on the earliest case date of the household ; N = 4 , 335 ) , as they would present challenges for estimating associations between household transmission and characteristics of the index case . Individual - level and neighbourhood - level characteristics of index cases The main exposure of interest was age group of the index case : 0 - 3 , 4 - 8 , 9 - 13 , and 14 - 17 years . We also a priori selected a group of individual - level and neighborhood - level characteristics of the index case to adjust for in the models . At the individual - level , we included gender , month of disease onset , and testing delay between symptom .

For the testing delay , we additionally categorized cases that were asymptomatic , identified as cases that were missing symptom onset date ( thus specimen collection date was used ) and were reported as asymptomatic in provincial reportable disease systems . As we only had individual - level household size information reported for 59 . 6 % of index cases , we also included average family size for the neighbourhood of the index case . Average family size was available from 2016 Canadian census records for aggregate dissemination areas across Ontario , representing areas of approximately 5 , 000 - 15 , 000 persons . For stratified and sensitivity analyses , we additionally included information on the presence of symptoms , whether the index case was linked to a school / childcare outbreak , and whether the index case’s disease onset was before or after school / childcare reopening ( depending on the age of the index case ) . In Ontario , schools reopened in mid - September 2020 and childcare reopened mid - June 2020 . Statistical analysis We carried out descriptive analyses to assess the characteristics of pediatric index cases across the four age groups , and included index cases aged > 17 years for comparison . Direction of transmission from index case to secondary case by age was also examined . We then applied three logistic regression models to obtain odds ratios ( OR ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) for the associations between index case age group and odds of household transmission : ( 1 ) a crude , unadjusted model ; ( 2 ) a model adjusted for gender and month of disease onset ( adjusted model 1 ) ; and ( 3 ) a model adjusted for gender , month of disease onset , testing delay , and average family size ( adjusted model 2 ) . For stratified analyses , these models were re - fit to subsets of the data broken down by three additional index case characteristics : ( 1 ) presence of symptoms ; ( 2 ) association with a school / childcare outbreak ; and ( 3 ) disease onset before school / childcare reopening . For sensitivity analyses , we first updated the definition of secondary cases to increase certainty of the direction of transmission from the index case ; we re - ran the analyses with secondary cases that developed symptoms 2 - 14 days after the index case and 4 - 14 days after the index case . Second , we adjusted for individual - level household size instead of neighbourhood - level average family size in the subset of index cases that had this information available . Third , we ran the analysis on a symptomatic cohort , restricting to index cases and secondary cases that had .

Last , we re - ran the symptomatic cohort analysis with the adjusted definitions for secondary cases ( i . e . , 2 - 14 days and 4 - 14 days ) . Results Between June and December 2020 , a total of 6 , 280 private households had a pediatric index case ( Figure 1 ) . The mean age of pediatric index cases was 10 . 7 years and 45 . 6 % were female . Of the 6 , 280 households , 1 , 717 ( 27 . 3 % ) experienced secondary household transmission , leading to a median of 2 secondary cases ( percentiles : 25 th = 1 case , 75 th = 2 cases , 90 th = 3 cases ) . Pediatric index cases most frequently transmitted infection to individuals aged 0 - 20 years or 30 - 50 years , with older children tending to transmit to older individuals in those age ranges ( Figure 2 ) . The proportion of index cases in each age group increased with age , with 12 % aged 0 - 3 , 20 % aged 4 - 8 , 30 % aged 9 - 13 , and 38 % aged 14 - 17 ( Table 1 ) . Compared to index cases in the oldest age group , younger index cases had a higher proportion associated with a school / childcare outbreak and shorter testing delays . Index cases aged 4 - 8 years and 9 - 13 years had higher proportion with no symptoms reported compared to index cases 14 - 17 years or index cases 0 - 3 years . Across all age groups , more index cases had disease onset in the fall / winter ( September - December ) compared to the summer ( June - August ) , which aligns with the trajectory of the second wave of the pandemic in Ontario . Associations with index case characteristics Compared to index cases aged 14 - 17 years , index cases aged 0 - 3 years had higher odds of household transmission in all three models ( crude model OR = 1 . 20 , 95 % CI : 1 . 01 - 1 . 44 ; adjusted model 1 OR = 1 . 21 , 95 % CI : 1 . 01 - 1 . 45 ; adjusted model 2 OR = 1 . 43 , 95 % CI : 1 . 17 - 1 . 75 ) ( Table 2 ) . There were no significant differences in the odds of transmission for the 4 - 8 and 9 - 13 year age groups , with the exception of adjusted model 2 for index cases aged 4 - 8 years ( 1 . 40 , 95 % CI : 1 . 18 - 1 . 67 ) . Additionally , there were incremental odds of transmission with longer testing delays compared to a 0 - day delay ( ORs : 1 - day delay = 1 . 24 , 2 - day delay = 1 . 59 , 3 - day delay = 1 . 97 , 4 - day delay = 2 . 38 , ≥ 5 - day delay = 2 . 98 ) , as well as increased odds of transmission with larger average family size ( 1 . 63 per person increase , 95 % CI : 1 . 43 - 1 . 86 ) . No significant differences were observed by gender or by month of disease onset . In stratified analyses , we did not observe significant heterogeneity ( p < 0 . 05 ) in the odds of household transmission between index cases with versus without symptoms reported , index cases not associated versus associated with a .

Sensitivity analyses of the crude model and adjusted model 1 resulted in the same direction of association for the 0 - 3 year age group , but confidence intervals widened ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . In adjusted model 2 , associations were largely unchanged with the 2 - 14 day definition , in the symptomatic case analysis , and when controlling for individual - level household size for the 0 - 3 year age group ( adjusted model 2 OR = 1 . 43 , 95 % CI : 1 . 17 - 1 . 75 ; 2 - 14 day OR = 1 . 37 , 95 % CI 1 . 11 - 1 . 69 ; symptomatic OR = 1 . 32 , 95 % CI 1 . 06 - 1 . 64 ; household size OR = 1 . 31 , 95 % CI : 1 . 02 - 1 . 67 ) and 4 - 8 year age group ( adjusted model 2 OR = 1 . 40 , 95 % CI : 1 . 18 - 1 . 67 ; 2 - 14 day OR = 1 . 33 , 95 % CI 1 . 11 - 1 . 60 ; symptomatic OR = 1 . 33 , 95 % CI 1 . 10 - 1 . 61 ; household size OR = 1 . 31 , 95 % CI : 1 . 06 - 1 . 62 ) . Associations for the 0 - 3 year and 4 - 8 year age groups were also similar to adjusted model 2 in the combined 2 - 14 day definition and symptomatic case analysis ( 0 - 3 year OR = 1 . 25 , 95 % CI 1 . 00 - 1 . 57 ; 4 - 8 year OR = 1 . 23 , 95 % CI 1 . 00 - 1 . 50 ) , as well as for the 0 - 3 year age group with the 4 - 14 day definition ( 1 . 35 , 95 % CI 1 . 07 - 1 . 70 ) and after further restricting to symptomatic cases ( 1 . 26 , 95 % CI 0 . 96 - 1 . 64 ) . Discussion In this study of 6 , 280 pediatric index cases , we observed that children aged 0 - 3 years had greater odds of household transmission compared to children aged 14 - 17 years . This association was observed irrespective of factors such as presence of symptoms , school / childcare reopening , or association with a school / childcare outbreak . We also observed some evidence of greater odds of household transmission for children aged 4 - 8 years after controlling for testing delays and neighbourhood - level average family size ( as well as individual - level household size ) . We identified clustering of ages in our age - to - age transmission plot , which likely reflects the age structure of households with younger pediatric cases living with , and transmitting to , younger caregivers and siblings . To date , there have been challenges with comparing the roles of children in household spread of SARS - CoV - 2 due to small numbers of pediatric cases . Zhu et al . 2 and Thompson et al . 15 conducted meta - analyses of studies examining the age of index cases in households , and found that 3 % - 19 % of households had pediatric index cases , depending on the definitions of index cases and pediatric cases ( < 18 years and < 20 years , respectively ) . We identified pediatric index cases aged < 18 years in approximately 7 % of all households ( 6 , 280 / 89 , 191 households ) , which is similar to studies from Greece ( 9 % < 18 years ) 26 , Switzerland ( 8 % < 16 years ) 27 , Denmark ( 5 % < 20 years ) 21 , Hunan , China ( 5 % .

Our results align with Danish studies from Lyngse et al . 21 , 22 , which found that among children there were increased odds of transmission with younger age . In the Danish study the OR for children aged 0 - 5 was 1 . 11 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 01 - 1 . 19 ) compared to the 30 - 35 year reference group , versus 0 . 82 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 78 - 0 . 85 ) for children aged 10 - 15 . 22 Soriano - Arandes et al . 16 also found that the highest OR for transmission was among index cases 0 - 2 years ( 2 . 27 , 95 % CI : 0 . 62 - 8 . 35 versus 12 - 15 year group ) , but confidence intervals were wide . Grijalva et al . 23 observed high household secondary attack rates ( SAR ) for both pediatric and adult index cases in Tennessee and Wisconsin , USA ; the SAR for index cases < 12 years was 53 % ( 95 % CI : 31 % - 74 % ) and for cases 12 - 17 years was 38 % ( 95 % CI : 23 % - 56 % ) . This compared to 55 % ( 95 % CI : 46 % - 64 % ) for cases 18 - 49 years and 62 % ( 95 % CI : 44 % - 77 % ) for cases ≥ 50 years . Thompson et al . 15 conducted a meta - analysis of studies and reported no significant difference in household SAR for index cases 0 - 9 years versus index cases 10 - 19 years . Conversely , Park et al . 20 found that household contacts of index cases 10 - 19 years had the highest SAR among 10 - year age groups of both children and adults at 18 . 6 % ( 95 % CI 14 . 0 % - 24 . 0 % ) , compared to 5 . 3 % ( 95 % CI 1 . 3 % - 13 . 7 % ) for index cases 0 - 9 years . Differences in viral shedding , symptom expression , and behavioral factors may explain differences in the odds of household transmission for pediatric age groups across studies . 4 , 5 , 21 , 22 Viral load is suspected to be an important factor affecting the odds of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . 22 , 28 , 29 Several studies of age - specific viral shedding of SARS - CoV - 2 have reported that viral loads in children are similar or higher than viral loads in adults . 22 , 30 – 33 In particular , one study reported that children < 5 years of age might carry more viral RNA in their nasopharynx than older children and adults . 30 Additionally , biases in testing practices , such as the preferential testing of symptomatic cases and contacts , inherently leads to under - detection of pediatric cases and challenges estimating their rates of transmission . 4 , 5 , 15 Studies have found younger children are more likely to be asymptomatic 3 , 16 , 26 , which has been .

A possible explanation for this finding , as mentioned by Lyngse et al . 21 and supported by our findings , is that younger children are not able to self - isolate from their caregivers when they are sick , irrespective of the timing of testing . Finally , Li et al . 12 observed both increased risk of transmission from individuals < 20 years and faster isolation of pediatric cases in Wuhan , suggesting possible higher infectivity of children compared to adults . This study has some limitations that should be acknowledged . First , there is the possibility of misclassifying household transmission if secondary case infection was truly acquired outside of the household , or if the true index case of the household was untested . This is particularly relevant for pediatric cases due to their increased probability of having mild or asymptomatic infection , and thus increased probability of infection being missed . We attempted to account for this in sensitivity analyses by modifying the secondary case definition from 1 - 14 days to 2 - 14 and 4 - 14 days , and restricting analysis to symptomatic cases only . Second , this study used multiple evolving data systems for reporting COVID - 19 cases in Ontario . As a result , there was some inconsistency regarding how symptoms were reported , which may result in some misclassification of symptomatic cases . We carefully examined the reporting practices over the months covered in the study , and selected a combination of variables ( symptoms reported , symptom onset date available , and / or asymptomatic flag ) we felt reflected the most likely symptom status of cases . Third , we could not reliably calculate SARs in the study as we did not know the number of non - infected contacts in households for the full cohort . However , after controlling for individual - level household size within the subset of the cohort with this information available , our conclusions were unaltered . This study also has several strengths . This is a large , population - based study of all individuals with confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection in Canada’s most populated province , thus we had sufficient data to explore transmission within the understudied pediatric group . We were also able to include relevant covariates such as testing delays and household size ; our results suggest that early testing of pediatric index cases and reduced household size / crowding may be useful strategies to minimize secondary household transmission . Second , the use of a natural language .

Third , our application of various sensitivity analyses for symptom status and the definition of secondary transmission increased our certainty of the direction of transmission from index case to secondary case , further supporting our findings . Conclusion As the number of pediatric cases increases worldwide , the role of children in household transmission will continue to grow . We found that younger children are more likely to transmit SARS - CoV - 2 infection compared to older children , and the highest odds of transmission were observed for children aged 0 - 3 years . Differential infectivity of pediatric age groups has implications for infection prevention controls within households and schools / childcare to minimize risk of household secondary transmission . Although children do not appear to transmit infection as frequently as adults , caregivers should be aware of the risk of transmission while caring for sick children in the household setting . As it is challenging and often impossible to socially isolate from sick children , caregivers should apply other infection control measures where feasible , such as use of masks , increased hand washing , and separation from siblings . .
