Moreover , membrane flows , which are driven by tension gradients , can 23 limit exo - endocytosis coupling in space and time , as net membrane flow from exocytic to 24 endocytic sites is required to maintain membrane homeostasis 13 . However , there is 25 controversy over how rapidly plasma membrane flows can relax tension gradients ; 26 contrary to the common view 12 , 14 , 15 , recent work showed membrane tension does not 27 equilibrate in several cell types 16 . Here we show membrane tension can propagate rapidly 28 or slowly , spanning orders of magnitude in speed , depending on cell type . In a neuronal 29 terminal specialized for rapid synaptic vesicle turnover and where exo - endocytosis events 30 occur at distinct loci , membrane tension equilibrates within seconds . By contrast , 31 membrane tension does not propagate in neuroendocrine adrenal chromaffin cells 32 secreting catecholamines . Thus , slow membrane flow and tension equilibration may confine 33 exo - and exocytosis to the same loci 17 . Stimulation of exocytosis causes a rapid , global 34 decrease in the synaptic terminal membrane tension , which recovers slowly due to 35 endocytosis . Our results demonstrate membrane tension propagates rapidly at neuronal 36 terminals and varies during synaptic activity , likely contributing to exo - endocytosis 37 coupling . 38 39 Neuronal presynaptic terminals are hubs of intense and rapid membrane turnover . Upon 40 stimulation , the equivalent area of the synaptic vesicles ( SVs ) that fuse rapidly with the 41 presynaptic plasma membrane is recovered through compensatory endocytosis to restore cell 42 membrane area and to maintain a releasable pool of SVs ( Figure 1a ) . How exocytosis triggers 43 endocytosis is under debate 18 , 19 ; a possible mechanism involves sensing at the endocytic site a 44 drop in cell membrane tension upon exocytic membrane addition some distance away 20 , 45 supported by the observation that even modest increases in membrane tension strongly inhibit 46 endocytosis 21 - 23 . However , recent work indicated that membrane tension gradients in several cell 47 types do not equilibrate over micron length scales for tens of minutes , implying extremely slow 48 membrane flows 16 . Membrane tension propagating so slowly could not possibly act as a signal to 49 trigger rapid compensatory endocytosis even at sites a few hundred nanometers away from 50 typical release sites 20 . Even if a signal other than a decrease in membrane tension triggered 51 endocytosis , membrane flow would be too slow to supply membrane to endocytic locations in 52 the periphery of active zones , at least in terminals with rapid synaptic vesicle turnover 13 . These 53 results suggest that either synaptic terminals must be specialized for facile membrane flow , or 54 that sensing exocytosis and supplying membrane to endocytic sites must occur via other means . 55 Here we used goldfish retinal bipolar neurons as a model to test these possibilities , as they 56 possess a single , giant ( ~ 10 Œºm ) terminal , filled with up to 50 active zones marked by a ribbon , a 57 dense structure to which approximately 100 SVs are attached and at the base of which most 58 release takes place 24 , 25 . Each terminal contains a total pool of ~ 0 . 5 million SVs 26 , 27 . These cells 59 release glutamate rapidly ( time constants 28 ~ 1 - 2 ms and 150 ms ) to graded potentials : up to ~ 10 - 60 15 % of the initial area can be added to the terminal within 250 ms upon strong stimulation 28 - 31 . 61 Endocytosis restores terminal membrane area at longer time scales ( ~ 2 s and ~ 30 s for weak and 62 strong stimuli 29 ) . Importantly , in these cells most endocytosis is known to occur away from 63 ribbon sites where exocytosis occurs 32 , 33 , implying relatively fast membrane flow ( Figure 1b ) . 64 As a comparison , we tested membrane tension propagation and flows in neuroendocrine adrenal 65 3 chromaffin cells . In contrast to neurons , these cells release their cargo in less spatially restricted 66 regions into the blood stream , undergoing exocytosis and endocytosis in overlapping regions 17 , 34 67 which does not necessitate long - range membrane flows . We find that membrane flow is 68 remarkably rapid in bipolar cell terminals , while it is at least two orders of magnitude slower in 69 adrenal chromaffin cells , suggesting that the dramatically different cell membrane 70 hydrodynamics reflect unique functional needs of different cell types ( Extended Data Figure 1 ) . 71 72 Membrane tension dynamics 73 To probe propagation of membrane tension in bipolar cell presynaptic terminals , we pulled a pair 74 of thin membrane tethers from the cell surface using 3 Œºm latex beads as handles ( Figure 1c ) . 75 First , a short " probe tether " was pulled using an optical trap ( OT ) and maintained at constant 76 length . Then a second , " pulling tether " was extruded a few Œºm using a bead manipulated by a 77 micropipette mounted on a programmable piezo stage . After equilibration , we extended the 78 pulling tether at 1 ¬µm s‚ÅÑ for 4 0 ¬µm , held it for 30 s , then relaxed it to its initial position , while 79 monitoring tension changes in the probe tether using OT . Extension of the pulling tether caused a 80 local increase in cell membrane tension ( Extended Data Figure 2 ) . Propagation of this local 81 change to the probe tether was monitored via the force acting on the probe tether using OT , ùëì ! = 82 2ùúã , 2ùúÖùúé ! , where ùúé ! is the tether membrane tension and Œ∫ ‚âà 0 . 27 pN‚àôŒºm is the bending 83 modulus 35 . The tether force is deduced from deviations of the bead‚Äôs position from the center of 84 the OT and known calibration of the trap stiffness , allowing us to estimate ùúé ! ( Methods ) . To 85 prevent spontaneous depolarizations which lead to exo - endocytosis 36 that could perturb 86 membrane tension measurements , we maintained cells in a low extracellular calcium solution . 87 Remarkably , membrane tension perturbations created by the pulling tether were transmitted 88 rapidly , within at most a few seconds , to the probe tether , despite being separated by 4 ‚àí 11 ¬µm 89 ( Figure 1c , Supplementary Movie 1 ) . As the pulling tether was extended , increasing tension in 90 the tether and its base ( Extended Data Figure 2 ) , tension in the probe tether increased . When 91 extension of the pulling tether stopped , tension in the probe tether started relaxing . When the 92 length of the pulling tether was decreased , tension in the probe tether decreased ( Figure 1c ) . 93 Additional experiments confirmed these observations and ruled out potential artifacts . First , 94 using similar double - tether experiments , we confirmed that in HeLa cells membrane tension does 95 not propagate over micrometer length scales within several minutes , consistent with a recent 96 report 16 ( data not shown ) . Second , we confirmed that tethers pulled from bipolar cells are 97 cytoskeleton - free ( Extended Data Figure 3 ) , as the force - tension relationship above assumes . 98 Third , we confirmed that membrane tension in the probe tether tracked tension changes in the 99 pulling tether by monitoring fluorescence changes simultaneously in the two tethers ( Extended 100 Data Figure 4 ) . We conclude that membrane tension equilibrates over several microns within a 101 few seconds in presynaptic terminals , in stark contrast to other cell types 16 . 102 To probe propagation of membrane tension in the soma , we repeated the double tether 103 experiments of Figure 1c but pulled both tethers from the soma , with inter - tether distances 4 - 12 104 Œºm ( n = 8 ) . We found the membrane tension perturbation created by the pulling tether was again 105 transmitted rapidly to the probe tether , but the change in membrane tension relative to its initial 106 value was smaller at the probe tether ( Extended Data Fig . 5 ) . These results were consistent with 107 fluorescence - based simultaneous tension estimates of the two tethers ( Extended Data Fig . 4e ) . 108 The resting tensions covered a broad range and were indistinguishable in the somata and 109 4 terminals , while the tension perturbation created by extending a tether increased in a similar 110 manner ( Extended Data Figure 2c - e ) . Thus , membrane tension also propagates rapidly in the 111 soma . Terminal - to - axon transmission of membrane tension changes were also rapid , with a 112 slightly lower amplitude , but inter - tether distances were larger ( 14 - 17 Œºm , n = 4 , Extended Data 113 Figure 5 ) . 114 As a comparison , we tested how rapidly tension propagates in neuroendocrine chromaffin cells , 115 where endo - and exocytosis occur in overlapping regions , using double - tether experiments as 116 above . Extending the pulling tether strongly increased membrane tension locally ( Extended Data 117 Figure 2 ) , yet , we could not detect membrane tension propagation over 6 - 12 Œºm in several 118 minutes in any of the 6 cells tested ( Figure 1e and Supplementary Movie 2 ) . 119 We conclude that membrane tension propagates very rapidly in bipolar cells and unmeasurably 120 slowly in adrenal chromaffin cells , two cell types specialized for secretion but with different 121 spatiotemporal secretory vesicle dynamics , the latter not requiring long - range plasma membrane 122 transport . 123 124 Tracer diffusion and immobile obstacles 125 We tested whether a difference in the mobility of integral transmembrane domain ( TMD ) 126 proteins could explain the large differences in membrane flows we observed among chromaffin 127 cells , bipolar neuronal terminals , and somata . We labeled surface proteins with an organic dye 128 and used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) , fitting measured curves to find an 129 immobile fraction and a diffusion constant of mobile labeled proteins ( Extended Data Figure 6 ) . 130 Surprisingly , we found no significant difference among the tracer diffusivities for the three cases 131 ( ùê∑ ! = ( 10 ¬± 6 . 7 ) √ó 10 " # , ( 19 ¬± 5 . 8 ) √ó 10 " # , and ( 11 ¬± 4 . 8 ) √ó 10 " # ¬µm $ / s , for chromaffin 132 cells , termini , and somata , respectively ) . The immobile fraction was similar for the terminal 133 ( 0 . 39 ¬± 0 . 02 ) and soma ( 0 . 37 ¬± 0 . 04 ) , which were ~ 30 % lower than for chromaffin cells 134 ( 0 . 60 ¬± 0 . 03 ) . 135 We wanted to understand whether the differences in TMD protein immobile fractions could 136 explain the differences in membrane tension propagation . The presence of immobile obstacles 137 can dramatically hinder bulk flow even while tracer diffusion remains relatively unimpeded , 138 especially in 2 - dimensions ( 2D ) 16 , 37 . We tested if a recent model 16 in which TMD proteins that 139 interact with the underlying cytoskeleton represent a random array of fixed obstacles to flow 140 could explain our observations . The model predicts diffusive membrane tension propagation , 141 with a tension diffusion coefficient ùê∑ % = ùê∏ùëò / ùúÇ , where ùê∏ is the membrane stretch modulus , ùúÇ is 142 the 2D membrane viscosity , and ùëò is the Darcy permeability of the array of obstacles . In a simple 143 model where obstacles are randomly arranged in space , the Darcy permeability is a function of 144 the obstacle area fraction ùúô and the radius ùëé of obstacles 16 , 37 , ùëò = ùëé $ ùëì ( ùúô ) , where ùëì ( ùúô ) is a 145 rapidly decaying function with increasing ùúô . We estimated ùúô from the immobile membrane 146 protein fraction we measured above . Assuming ~ 25 % of membrane area is occupied by 147 transmembrane proteins 38 , 39 , ùúô ‚âà 0 . 093 ¬± 0 . 01 , ùúô ‚âà 0 . 096 ¬± 0 . 005 in the soma and terminal , 148 respectively , and ùúô ‚âà 0 . 149 ¬± 0 . 007 in chromaffin cells , yielding ùëò ‚âà 7 . 45 ¬± 3 . 7 nm 2 and 149 6 . 96 ¬± 2 . 3 nm 2 for the soma and terminal , and ùëò ‚âà 3 . 01 ¬± 1 . 06 . 7 nm 2 for chromaffin cells . 150 Assuming similar values for ùëé , ùúÇ and ùê∏ for bipolar and chromaffin cells , only a 2 . 4 - fold 151 difference in the tension diffusion coefficient ùê∑ % would be expected , which is insufficient to 152 explain the differences of membrane tension propagation between chromaffin cells and bipolar 153 5 neurons . Using numerical calculations , we estimate 100 - 1000 - fold larger ùê∑ % is needed to explain 154 the rapid membrane flow we observe in bipolar cells compared to chromaffin or HeLa cells , if 155 tension propagates diffusively ( Figure 2a , see also Supplementary Information and Extended 156 Data Figure 7 ) . In addition , the speed and amplitude of tension propagation show little , if any , 157 distance dependence ( Figure 2b , c ) , suggesting the underlying propagation mechanism may not 158 be diffusive in bipolar neurons . In summary , neither tracer diffusion nor the fraction of immobile 159 obstacles can explain the large differences in membrane tension propagation we observe in 160 bipolar and chromaffin cells . Thus , while our results cannot rule out a model in which the cell 161 membrane flows are heavily disturbed by immobile TMD proteins 16 , other factors likely 162 contribute to the propagation of membrane tension in bipolar cells . 163 164 Plasma membrane - cytoskeleton drag 165 The dominant resistance to membrane flow in cell membranes arises from interactions of the 166 plasma membrane with the adjacent layer of the underlying cytoskeleton 16 , 40 . Forcing membrane 167 tethers to slide on the cell surface and monitoring the force - velocity relationship provides a 168 measure of this resistance 41 . 169 We found most tethers ( 12 / 15 ) could be dragged with ease around the bipolar cell terminal as 170 soon as a finite tangential force was generated by moving the cell with respect to the bead 171 holding the end of the tether ( Figure 3a , b , and Supplementary Movie 3 ) . Occasionally , tethers 172 were transiently immobilized for 1 - 3 s . Combining image analysis with force measurements , we 173 quantified , ùëì ‚à• , the force tangent to the terminal membrane and the distance traveled by the tether 174 base for every frame ( Figure 3c ) . From the distance profile , we computed the frame - to - frame 175 velocities . Tether base velocity as a function of tangential force is shown in Figure 3d ( black 176 circles ) . Low forces ( ~ 6 pN ) were sufficient to produce large velocities . Tethers moved mostly 177 unimpeded , interspersed with transient pauses , likely due to the heterogeneous nature of the 178 underlying cytoskeleton . By contrast , most tethers extruded from chromaffin cells ( 8 / 10 ) were 179 immobile . Tethers that did slide here required much larger forces ( ~ 24 pN ) , and paused more 180 frequently after initial sliding for ~ 0 . 25 - 1 Œºm ( Figure 3h - j and Supplementary Movie 4 ) . Tethers 181 dragged from bipolar cell somata displayed intermediate behaviour ( Figure 3e - g , Extended Data 182 Figure 8 and Supplementary Movie 5 ) . 183 Disruption of the actin cortex using latrunculin A ( LatA , prevents actin polymerization 42 ) 184 facilitated tether sliding in terminals and somata , and to a lesser extent in chromaffin cells 185 ( Figure 3g , j , Extended Data Figure 8 ) . After treatment with 20 ŒºM LatA for 20 min , which does 186 not lead to visible bleb formation , most tethers drawn from somata ( 5 / 7 , 71 % ) could be dragged 187 with ease and supported forces ( Fùëì ‚à• G ‚âà 1 . 6 pN ) similar to those in treated terminals ( Fùëì ‚à• G ‚âà 0 . 9 188 pN ) . Tethers from treated chromaffin cells slid readily ( 2 / 2 ) , albeit at high angles and with higher 189 forces ( Fùëì ‚à• G ‚âà 18 pN ) than untreated termini or somata . 190 Together , these results suggest that the cytoskeleton impedes tether sliding to a much higher 191 degree in chromaffin cells than in bipolar cell somata . Tethers drawn from terminals display 192 minimal resistance to tether dragging , despite possessing a readily detectable F - actin cortex ( refs . 193 43 , 44 and Extended Data Figure 3 ) . 194 195 Activity - dependent changes in membrane tension 196 6 Membrane area changes of the terminal have been monitored directly using time - resolved 197 capacitance 29 , 30 , 45 : the excess area added to the terminal upon mild stimulation ( up to 0 . 2 s 198 depolarization to 0 mV , leading to fusion of ~ 2000 SVs , or ~ 8 % of the terminal area ) is 199 recovered through rapid endocytosis ( time constant ~ 1 s ) , whereas membrane area increases 200 elicited by stronger stimulation are restored over ~ 20 - 30 s . If synaptic vesicles fuse completely 201 with the active zone membrane 32 , 33 and tension perturbations propagate rapidly in the terminal , 202 we expect to observe a rapid , terminal - wide decrease in membrane tension upon strong 203 stimulation of exocytosis , followed by slower recovery due to endocytosis . 204 To test this hypothesis , we used two approaches . First , we took advantage of the fact that some 205 bipolar cells spontaneously develop calcium action potentials that drive exocytosis 36 . We loaded 206 cells with a calcium indicator , Fluo - 4 - AM , to monitor calcium fluctuations 46 while 207 simultaneously measuring membrane tension at the terminal using OT . Occasionally , cells 208 displayed robust calcium activity . Calcium spikes anti - correleated with membrane tension 209 ( Extended Data Figure 9 ) , consistent with calcium - stimulated exocytosis reducing membrane 210 tension and endocytosis driving its recovery 36 . Second , to exert better control over the release 211 process , we used a photochemical approach to stimulate exo - and endocytosis ( Figure 4 ) . 212 Neurotransmitter release in type Mb bipolar cells is driven by calcium entry via L - type calcium 213 channels 47 , 48 . To stimulate release , we bathed the cells in nifedipine ( 20 ŒºM ) , a blocker of L - type 214 DHP - sensitive calcium channels 49 . Photolysis of nifedipine at 405 nm removes the block , 215 allowing calcium influx and exocytosis 50 . We loaded cells with a calcium indicator , Fluo - 4 - AM , 216 to monitor calcium entry upon stimulation 46 . We pulled a membrane tether and monitored its 217 tension while imaging calcium signals using time - lapse spinning - disc confocal microscopy . 218 Stimulation with 405 nm illumination for 1 s caused a rapid increase in the calcium signal 219 ( Figure 4b , c ) . There was a concomitant decrease in membrane tension with a characteristic time 220 of ~ 1 - 2 s . Even though the cytosolic calcium increase and the accompanying exocytosis occur 221 instantly at the time resolution of these recordings ( 1 frame / s ) , the tension decrease is slower , 222 limited by how rapidly the cell membrane flows over the cell ' s surface and into the tether 223 ( Extended Data Fig 2f ) . Membrane tension recovered more slowly , over a 10 - 20 s time scale 224 ( Figure 4c ) . The initial rapid decrease in membrane tension was likely due to exocytosis , as no 225 change in cytosolic calcium or membrane tension occurred without nifedipine photolysis or 226 when photolyis was carried out in the absence of extracellular calcium ( Extended Data Figure 227 9e ) . The slow recovery of membrane tension was likely due to endocytosis , because treatment 228 with myristyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ( MiTMAB ) , an agent that blocks endocytosis by 229 inhibiting dynamins I and II 51 , 52 , inhibited recovery . The recovered fraction of membrane tension 230 within 50 s of stimulation was ~ 1 . 0 , 0 . 49 , and 0 . 29 with 0 , 10 , or 30 ŒºM MiTMAB , respectively 231 ( Figure 4 and Extended Data Figure 9 ) . We used pro - myristic acid , rapidly broken into myristic 232 acid in the cytosol , as a negative control , which did not affect membrane tension dynamics 233 ( Extended Data Figure 9 ) . No tension changes could be detected in the soma during neuronal 234 activity ( Figure 4d ) . Thus , synaptic vesicle recycling generates large changes in membrane 235 tension which are mostly confined to the terminal . 236 237 DISCUSSION 238 We have shown that cell membranes can flow at vastly different speeds , likely reflecting 239 physiological requirements . In neuronal presynaptic terminals , rapid membrane flow is likely an 240 adaptation required for maintaining SV exo - endocytosis at distinct loci , as recognized nearly 50 241 7 years ago 13 . Because endocytosis is inhibited strongly with increased membrane tension 21 - 23 , fast 242 terminal - wide equilibration of membrane tension gradients likely contributes to the signaling that 243 couples exo - and endocytosis 20 , 29 . Conversely , slow membrane flow likely limits the spatial and 244 temporal extent of exo - endocytic coupling in neuroendocrine adrenal cells . Upon fusion , 245 secretory granules rarely collapse into the plasma membrane in such cells 17 , 34 , and those that do 246 take seconds to do so 17 , 53 , consistent with the extremely slow membrane flow we observed in 247 chromaffin cells . 248 Resistance to membrane flow primarily arises from interactions of the cell membrane with the 249 underlying cytoskeleton 12 , 16 , 40 . Consistent with hydrodynamic models of 2D flow around fixed 250 obstacles 16 , we found tracer mobility is a poor predictor of membrane flow . The fraction of 251 immobile membrane proteins is a better indicator , but cannot quantitatively explain the large 252 differences between membrane flows we observed . Tether drag and its sensitivity to agents 253 disrupting the cortical F - actin network correlates much better with the observed membrane 254 flows . Thus , it is likely that membrane tension dynamics are governed not only by the density of 255 the immobile obstacles , but also by their spatial arrangements 54 , 55 , hydrodynamic drag between 256 the membrane and the cytoskeleton , and how easily the immobile obstacles can be detached from 257 the cytoskeleton under flow 40 , 56 . Like chromaffin cells 57 , bipolar cell terminals possess a 258 dynamic F - actin cortex 43 , 44 , but the arrangement of the actin cytoskeleton , how it is linked to the 259 PM , and how these interactions affect membrane flows at presynaptic terminals will need to be 260 addressed in the future . 261 262 8 263 Figure 1 | Membrane tension propagates rapidly in neuronal synaptic terminals , but not in 264 endocrine chromaffin cells . a .

In 268 goldfish retinal bipolar terminals release predominantly occurs at active zones marked by ribbons 269 where synaptic vesicles are tethered ( depicted as a grey oval ) .

For bipolar 322 cell terminals , and to a lesser extent for somata , very small forces were sufficient to set a tether 323 in motion , whereas tethers drawn from chromaffin cells required much larger forces to slide . 324 LatA treatment reduced forces in all cases , even though there was no visible blebbing under 325 these conditions . 326 12 327 Figure 4 | Activity - dependent changes in membrane tension in bipolar neurons . a . Principle 328 of photstimulation employed . Nifedipine ( depicted as a red hexagon ) blocks L - type calcium 329 channels . Photolysis at 405 nm removes the block , causing calcium entry and exocytosis 50 . b . 330 Example of a simultaneous calcium - imaging and tether - force measurement during 331 photostimulation of a bipolar cell terminal . A membrane tether was pulled from a bipolar cell 332 terminal and membrane tension monitored while nifedipine in the bath ( 20 ŒºM ) was photolysed 333 by a 1 s 405 nm pulse . The cell was pre - loaded with the calcium indicator Fluo - 4 . Top row : 334 Fluo - 4 fluorescence . Bottom row : brightfield imaging . The two channels were alternated during 335 acquisition . The tether becomes visible upon stimulation and calcium increase ( 2nd column ) , 336 indicating a sharp decrease in tether tension . Scale bar = 5 Œºm . c . Fractional changes in 337 membrane tension ( black , left axis ) and calcium signals ( red , right axis ) averaged over 6 338 experiments . Photolysis was applied for 1 s starting at ùë° = 0 s . Membrane tension recovered 339 completely within 50 s after stimulation . The region of interest used for fluorescence 340 quantification is indicated in the schematic as a dashed circle . d . Similar to c , but the tether - 341 forces were measured in the soma ( n = 4 ) . Most L - type calcium channels are in the terminal where 342 calcium dynamics are largely confined 48 . e . Inhibition of endocytosis by MiTMAB , a dynamin 343 inhibitor 51 , 52 , is expected to reduce recovery of membrane tension following exocytosis . f . 344 Similar to c , but measurements were made in the presence of 30 ŒºM MiTMAB to block 345 endocytosis ( n = 4 ) . Only ~ 30 % of the initial drop in membrane tension upon stimulation 346 recovered .

Goldfish retinal bipolar neuron dissection and dissociation was carried 501 out following ref . 58 . Goldfish were first dark adapted for at least 20 min . , then decapitated using 502 a scalpel and promptly pithed . Eyes were removed , hemisected , and placed in oxygenated 503 dissociation buffer containing ( in mM ) 120 NaCl , 2 . 5 KCl , 0 . 5 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES , 0 . 75 504 EGTA , 10 Glucose , pH 7 . 4 , 260 mOsm ( osmolarity was checked with a Precision Systems 505 Micro - Osmette Osmometer ) . Retina was removed from eyecups and placed in hyaluronidase 506 solution 1100 units / ml ( Sigma , H3884 ) , dissolved in dissociation buffer to remove vitreous for a 507 minimum of 12 minutes . Retinas were removed from hyaluronidase solution and cut into four to 508 six pieces ( each about 3 mm x 3 mm ) . Retina pieces were digested with papain solution ( 12 . 5 509 mg / ml , Sigma 76220 ) for 30 minutes containing 0 . 5 mg / ml L - cysteine ( Sigma C7352 ) added to 510 dissociation buffer . Pieces of tissues were removed from papain , rinsed in dissociation buffer , 511 and kept at 12 - 14¬∞C for 4 - 6 hours . To obtain dissociated retinal bipolar neurons , retina pieces 512 were mechanically triturated using a fire polished Pasteur pipette and plated onto glass - bottom 513 MatTek dishes coated with Poly - d - lysine ( MatTek , P35GC - 1 . 5 - 14 - C ) . Retinal bipolar neurons 514 were visually identified by morphology . 515 Mouse chromaffin cells from 1 - month - old mice ( C57Bl6 ) were cultured following ref . 59 . 516 Briefly , animals were euthanized using isoflurane overdose followed by cervical dislocation , the 517 abdomen was open and both adrenal glands were removed . The medullas were dissected using a 518 stereo microscope and transferred to a sterile Petri dish containing 1 mL of sterile ice‚Äêcold 519 Locke ' s solution containing ( in mM ) 154 NaCl , 5 KCl , 3 . 6 NaHCO 3 , HEPES , and 11glucose . 520 Tissues were disaggregated using papain ( 60 ‚Äì 90 UI / mL ) for 15 ‚Äì 20 min at 37¬∞C without shaking . 521 Subsequently , tissues were washed with 800 ¬µL of fresh Locke ' s solution and passed through 1 522 mL and 100 ¬µL pipette tips , until the suspension became turbid . Cells were plated onto glass - 523 bottom MatTek dishes coated with Poly - d - lysine . 524 Optical tweezers 525 The setup consists of a Perkin - Elmer Ultraview spinning - disc confocal system with a 526 NikonTE2000 inverted microscope , Yokogawa CSU - X1 scanhead , a Hamamatsu C9100 - 50 527 EMCDD camera , and laser lines for 405 , 488 , 532 , and 640 nm , controlled by Volocity or Œº - 528 manager software 60 . An optical trap is generated by focussing a 1064 nm laser beam ( Coherent 529 Matrix , 10 W ) through a 100x / 1 . 45 oil objective lens ( Nikon Plan Apo Œª ) ~ 10 Œºm above the 530 coverslip surface . Samples are moved by a piezoelectric stage ( 300 Œºm x 300 Œºm range , 531 Piezoconcept , France ) , which is controllable via a joystick , Labview Virtual Instruments ( VIs ) , 532 or analog signals from a waveform generator ( Agilent 33522A ) . A micropipette holder is 533 attached to another , programmable 3 - axis piezo unit ( 100 Œºm range per axis , P - 611 . 3 NanoCube , 534 with controller E - 727 and Mikromove software , Physik Instrumente , Germany ) that is used for 535 programmable motion of the " pulling tether " . The 3 - axis piezo stage is mounted onto a Newport 536 manual M - 462 Series xyz stage for coarse movement . 537 Trap stiffness was calibrated using a hydrodynamic flow method , following ref . 61 . In a closed 538 sample cell , the stage is oscillated with a sine wave , with peak - to - peak amplitude ùê¥ + + and drive 539 frequency ùëì , , while a bead is trapped with OT . The bead positions are recorded using the 540 EMCCD camera , at rates up to 85 Hz from small region of interest around the bead . The stage 541 18 velocity ùë£ , is assumed to be equal to the liquid velocity , ùë£ - . Inertial forces are negligible because 542 the Reynolds number is typically small : ùëÖ ) = ( ùë£ - √ó ùê∑ . ) / , √ó œÅ ) / Œ∑ ~ 10 " 0 with ùê∑ . ) / , ~ 1 Œºm , 543 œÅ ~ 10 " 1 ùëùùëÅ ‚ãÖ ùë† $ / ¬µùëö 2 ( 1 ùëòùëî / ùëö # ) , Œ∑ ~ 10 " # ùëùùëÅ ‚ãÖ ùë† / ¬µùëö $ , ùë£ - ~ 1 ‚àí 10 ¬µùëö / ùë† . The bead 544 experiences a hydrodynamic force ùëì 34 , 56 = Œ≥ ( ùë£ . ‚àí ùë£ - ) , where ùë£ . is the bead velocity and Œ≥ = 545 6ùúãùúÇùëÖ . ) / , . In the regime ùë§ , ‚ãÖ œÑ ‚â™ 1 , where ùë§ , is the angular frequency of stage oscillation 546 ( ùë§ , = 2œÄùëì , ) and œÑ = Œ≥ / ùëò 75 / + , the amplitude of the bead ' s motion is ùê¥ . ) / , = œÑùë§ , ùê¥ + + / 2 .

Trap stiffness was found to be linear with laser power . Trap 549 stiffnesses used were in the range 73 - 271 pN / ¬µ m . We used carboxylated latex beads of 1 . 9 ¬± 550 0 . 16 , or 3 . 2 ¬± 0 . 19 Œºm ( mean¬±SD ) diameter ( Invitrogen , referred to in text as 2 or 3 Œºm beads ) . 551 For tether force measurements , a bead was trapped in the OT and its zero - force position , ( ùë• 6 , ùë¶ 6 ) , 552 was recorded for at least 10 s and averaged at rate ~ 14 or 30 frames / s . The bead was then 553 brought into contact with the cell surface for ~ 1 s , and then pulled away from the membrane by 554 joystick control of the piezo stage to form a membrane tether . Typically more than half of 555 attempts were successful with bipolar cells but with chromaffin cells the success rate was 556 somewhat lower . Bead positions ( ùë• , ùë¶ ) were recorded using digital image stacks . The presence of 557 a tether was confirmed by visual assessment when possible ( e . g . when the cell membrane was 558 labeled with a dye or when the tether was visible in contrast - enhanced brightfield images ) or by 559 releasing the bead at the end of the experiment and observing it being pulled back to the cell 560 surface . Bead positions were tracked offline using a custom - made MATLAB ( Mathworks , MA ) 561 program that uses the Image Processing Toolbox function " imfindcircles " to detect the bead 562 using a circular Hough transform algorithm , then calculates the weighted centroid of the bead . 563 The deviation of the bead ' s position Œîùëü = , ( ùë• ‚àí ùë• 6 ) $ + ( ùë¶ ‚àí ùë¶ 6 ) $ from its zero - force position 564 was calculated for each frame and used to calculate the force acting on the bead , ùëì . = ùëò 75 / + Œîùëü , 565 using the trap stiffness calculated as above . Imaging beads immobilized on a coverslip indicated 566 the centroid of a bead can be detected with a root - mean - squared error of ~ 17 nm at 33 Hz 567 sampling in brightfield images . With a typical ùëò 75 / + = 75 pN / Œºm , this translates to an error in 568 force estimation of ùõøùëì . = 1 . 3 pN . 569 Membrane tension was estimated from the tether force acting on the bead 40 , 62 , ùëì ! = 2œÄ , 2Œ∫ œÉ ! , 570 where ùúé is the membrane tension , and ùúÖ = 0 . 27 pN ‚ãÖ ¬µm is the membrane bending modulus for 571 neuronal growth cones 62 , a value within the range reported for other cells 63 - 66 ( 0 . 18 ‚àí 0 . 32 pN ‚ãÖ 572 ¬µm ) . 573 Double tether pulling 574 Goldfish retinal bipolar neurons were dissociated and plated into Ringers solution without Ca 2 + 575 ( 130 mM NaCl , 4 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES , 10 mM Glucose , 4 mM EGTA , pH 576 7 . 3 , 260 mOsm ) . Chromaffin cells were plated into Locke ' s solution lacking Ca 2 + . Calcium was 577 omitted to prevent secretion that could affect membrane tension measurements . A micropipette 578 with a ~ 1 Œºm diameter tip was attached to a pipette holder and lowered into the solution while 579 applying positive pressure . Beads ( 3 Œºm diameter ) were added to the dish , and a bead was caught 580 at the tip of the pipette by applying negative pressure . Another bead was captured with the OT , 581 and a tether ( the " probe tether " ) was pulled to a few Œºm length and held stationary . The bead 582 held by the micropipette was then lowered further and used to pull a second tether ( the " pulling 583 tether " ) from the cell surface to a few Œºm length using a joystick . After equilibration , the pulling 584 19 bead was extended by 40 Œºm at 1 Œºm / s , held for 30 s , then returned to the initial position at 1 585 Œºm / s , using an automated protocol . Images were acquired at a rate of ~ 13 - 14 or 30 frames / s , 586 except for experiments shown in Extended Data Figure 4 that used CellMask Deep Red 587 fluorescence to track membrane tension changes , where the frame rate was limited to ~ 4 . 2 588 frame / s due to photobleaching . 589 Photostimulation 590 For photostimulation , goldfish retinal bipolar neurons were dissociated and plated into a glass - 591 bottom MatTek dish using 2 mM Ca 2 + Ringers solution ( 125 mM NaCl , 4 mM KCl , 1 mM 592 MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 10 mM HEPES , 10 mM Glucose , pH 7 . 3 , 260 mOsm ) supplemented by 593 1ŒºM Fluo - 4 - AM , a fluorescent calcium indicator dye , and 20 ŒºM Nifedipine , a photolyzable L - 594 type calcium - channel blocker . While allowing 30 minutes for attachment and dye uptake , a 595 bipolar cell was visually identified . Immediately after washing with 2 mM Ca 2 + Ringers solution 596 without nifedipine or Fluo - 4 - AM , a membrane tether was pulled from the presynaptic terminal 597 using a 3 Œºm diameter carboxylated latex bead . Images were recorded alternating between 598 brightfield ( to record the bead position ) and fluorescence ( 488 nm excitation , 0 . 5 % laser power , 599 Chroma 527 / 55 nm band - pass emission filter , for calcium imaging using Fluo - 4 ) at a rate 1 600 frame / s / channel . For stimulating calcium entry and secretion , nifedipine was photolysed using 601 the 405 nm laser at full power for 1 s . Bead displacements were analyzed to determine 602 membrane tension as above , and calcium dynamics were analyzed by plotting the fluorescence 603 ( background - corrected pixel values in a region of intetest ) relative to its initial value , ùõ•ùêπ / ùêπ 6 . 604 Tether Sliding 605 Goldfish retinal bipolar neurons were dissociated and plated into Ringers solution without Ca 2 + 606 ( 120 mM NaCl , 4 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES , 10 mM Glucose , 4 mM EGTA , pH 607 7 . 3 , 260 mOsm ) and with 5 ŒºM CellMask Deep Red ( Thermo Fisher ) to visualize tethers . A few 608 initial experiments used 14 ŒºM FM4 - 64 ( Invitrogen ) instead of CellMask Deep Red , with no 609 obvious difference in results . Tethers were extruded as above using a 2 or 3 Œºm diameter bead , 610 either from the terminal or soma of a retinal bipolar neuron , or from a chromaffin cell . In some 611 cases , 20 ŒºM Latrunculin - A ( LatA , Cayman Chemicals ) was added to the bath during cell 612 plating to disrupt the F - actin cytoskeleton . 613 Image Analysi s : Tether sliding was quantified using a pipeline incorporating semi - automated 614 image processing in ImageJ and analyses in MatLab . Bead force measurements were performed 615 as described above , using a custom MatLab script that tracked the bead center through every 616 frame utilizing the Computer Vision toolbox 67 . Videos were registered in the frame of the cell 617 using ImageJ‚Äôs Linear Stack Alignment with SIFT plugin 68 . Significant registration drift was 618 corrected with a manually tracked stationary landmark . The membrane contour was initiated 619 manually for an initial frame , which was then tracked for that and subsequent frames using the 620 Jfilament plugin 69 . The bead center was additionally tracked in the new reference frame . The 621 point at which the bead contacts the membrane ( the tether base ) was manually tracked through 622 each frame in ImageJ . 623 Data Analysis : Points from the tracked cell outline were fit with a spline , and the tangent line 624 calculated at the nearest point to the tether base . The angle between the line perpendicular to the 625 tangent and a straight line connecting the tether base to the bead defines the tether - membrane 626 angle ùúÉ . The tangential force on the membrane ùëì ‚à• is the sine of the tether - membrane angle ùúÉ 627 multiplied by the total tether force at the given frame . The cumulative distance traveled by the 628 20 tether base was extracted from each video . Cumulative distance and force traces were smoothed 629 with a Gaussian with width 1 s . The tether velocity ùë£ ! is then calculated per - frame as the 630 derivative of the cumulative distance trace . 631 Forces and velocities were collated across individual experiments within each cell type for 632 further analyses . The maximum supported force , ùëì ‚à• , 9 / : is the peak of the force trace when the 633 tether is stalled , i . e . when velocity is below 500 nm / s , estimated to be the level of noise for a 634 stationary tether . Obstacle density is the number of individual obstacles encountered divided by 635 the total distance traveled by the tether base . Obstacles result in tether base stalling ( ùë£ ! < 500 636 nm / s ) despite sustaining a substantial tangential force ( ùëì ‚à• > 5 pN ) . Obstacles were counted as 637 distinct if separated by velocities ùë£ ! > 500 nm / s . 638 Tracer diffusion and immobile fraction of membrane proteins 639 Retinal bipolar neurons and chromaffin cells were labeled with 250 ¬µg / ml Alexa - 488 - NHS dye 640 ( Thermo Fisher ) for 30 min at room temperature ( RT ) or 37 ¬∞ C respectively . Photobleaching was 641 performed using a Leica SP8 inverted confocal microscope by scanning the 488 nm and 480 nm 642 beams operating at 100 % laser power over a circular region of interest ( ROI , diameter 2 . 4 Œºm ) in 643 the imaging plane , set around the middle of the cell ' s height . With an optical section thickness of 644 ~ 0 . 85 Œºm , the cell membrane area that is bleached is approximately a 2 . 4 Œºm by 0 . 85 Œºm 645 rectangle ( in the xz plane ) . Four frames were acquired at low ( 2 % ) laser power for normalization 646 of the fluorescence signal before bleaching the ROI for 13 s as explained above . Recovery was 647 monitored for 30 frames every 1290 ms and then 15 - 30 frames every min at low laser power 648 ( 2 % ) . Image size was 512 x 512 pixels . The background was determined with the same ROI area 649 outside the cell using ImageJ and subtracted from the signal . 650 Postbleach fluorescence recovery traces were fit to F ( ùë° ) = qùêπ ‚Äô + ùêπ ; rùë° / ùë° < / $ st / r1 + ùë° / ùë° < / $ s 651 where ùêπ ‚Äô is the initial postbleach fluorescence , ùêπ ; is the asymptote , and ùë° < / $ is the half - time of 652 recovery . Best - fit values for these parameters were estimated using MatLab‚Äôs Curve Fitting 653 Toolbox . The tracer diffusion constant is calculated 70 as ùê∑ ! = ùê¥ . - ) / > 3 / r4 ùë° < / $ s , where 654 ùê¥ . - ) / > 3 = 2 . 4 √ó 0 . 85 ¬µm 2 is the photobleached area . The mobile fraction of proteins is 655 estimated as ùêπ ; ‚àí ùêπ ‚Äô . 656 Tether force as a function of tether extension 657 Goldfish retinal bipolar neurons were dissociated and plated into Ringers solution without 658 calcium . A 3 Œºm diameter bead was used to pull a short membrane tether as above . After the 659 tether force stabilized , the tether was extended by moving the cell away from the OT center via 660 programmable movement of the piezoelectric stage at 1 Œºm / s . Images were acquired at a rate of 661 13 - 15 frames / s , with ùëò 75 / + = 73 - 75 pN / ¬µ m . Changes in tether force or normalized membrane 662 tension vs . extension curves were plotted ( Extended Data Figure 2 ) . For chromaffin cells , a 663 similar protocol was used , except a larger trap stiffness ( ùëò 75 / + = 271 pN / ¬µ m ) had to be used to 664 prevent the bead from escaping the trap prematurely . 665 A sudden , short extension of a static tether was used to test the response of the tether force to a 666 step - like tether extension . After a tether was extruded , the tether force was allowed to stabilize 667 for ~ 10 s . The stage was moved by 1 - 3 Œºm at 10 - 500 Œºm / s while the force was monitored . Force 668 profiles were normalized to ùëìv = ( ùëì ‚àí ùëì ‚Äô ) / ( ùëì 9 / : ‚Äì ùëì ‚Äô ) and averaged ( Extended Data Figure 2 ) . A 669 double - exponential function was fit to the data using the Matlab Curve Fitting toolbox . 670 21 Fluorescence - based tether force estimates 671 To test the relationship between the tether force ùëì ! and tether diameter ùëü ! , cells were incubated 672 with 5 ŒºM CellMask Deep Red dye for 15 min in calcium - free Ringers . A short tether was 673 extruded in brightfield mode and held stationary until the force settled . Then the tether was 674 extended at 1 Œºm / s while fluroescence images were acquired at ~ 4 . 2 frames / s . Tether force was 675 calculated from the fluorescence channel images as above ( CellMask also labeled the beads , 676 allowing their tracking ) . Tether fluorescence was estimated from a region of interest ( ROI , see 677 Extended Data Figure 4 for an example ) . The number of pixels in the tether ROI was doubled 678 using bicubic interpolation , rotated and the pixels along the direction of the tether were averaged . 679 A Gaussian function was fit to the averaged lateral intensity profile and the area under the 680 Gaussian was taken as the background - corrected tether fluorescence intensity , ùêº ! . This procedure 681 was repeated for every frame in a movie stack . Typical tether diameters are much smaller than 682 the optical sectioning ( ~ 0 . 85 Œºm ) ; thus , tether fluorescence is integrated over the thickness of the 683 tether . Because ùëì ! ~ 1 / ùëü ! ~ , œÉ @ ( see above and refs . 40 , 62 ) and ùêº ! ~ 2œÄ ùëü ! ùëô , where ùëô is the length of 684 the ROI along the tether , ùëì ! ~ 1 / ùêº ! , and œÉ ! ~ 1 / ùêº ! $ . We plotted the relationship between ùëì ! and ùêº ! 685 both in dynamic experiments ( where the tether was being pulled at 1 Œºm / s , e . g . Extended Data 686 Figure 4a , b ) and static measurements ( where the tether was held at stationary length , Extended 687 Data Figure 4c ) . In both cases a linear relationship was obtained . 688 To test how membrane tension changes at the pulling tether are communicated to the probe 689 tether , we pulled two tethers simultaneously as described earlier , but we labeled the cells using 690 CellMask Deep Red as above , and imaged cells in fluorescence ( ~ 4 . 2 frame / s ) . We analyzed the 691 fluorescence of each tether as above , and plotted 1 / ùêº ! $ ~ ùúé ! for the two tethers ( Extended Data 692 Figure 4d , e ) . 693 Imaging of the F - actin cytoskeleton 694 Cells were incubated with 1 - 2 ŒºM of SiR - Actin ( Cytoskeleton , Inc . Spirochrome ) for 15 - 30 min 695 in calcium - free buffer , then a tether was pulled as described above . SiR - Actin fluorescence was 696 monitored using 640 nm excitation and a Chroma 485 / 60 nm , 705 / 90 nm band - pass emission 697 filter using spinning disc confocal microscopy . We could not detect any Sir - Actin fluorescence 698 in the tethers ( 5 , 5 , and 6 tethers extruded from the termini and somata of bipolar cells , and 699 chromaffin cells , respectively ) . Robust SiR - Actin labeling was evident in every case below the 700 plasma memrbane in intact regions of the cells ( Extended Data Figure 3 ) . 701 Reagents and materials 702 22 Modeling 703 A detailed description of the numerical simulations and fitting procedures can be found in the 704 Supplementary Information . 705 Statistics 706 Data were analyzed by MATLAB software . Statistical significance was determined by one - way 707 ANOVA ( Extended Data Figure 2c ) or Kolmogorov - Smirnov test ( CDF comparisons , Extended 708 Data Figure 8 ) . 709 710 Reporting Summary 711 Further information on experimental design is available in the Nature Reporting Summary 712 accompanying this paper . 713 714 Data Availability 715 The datasets generated during the current study are available from the corresponding author on 716 reasonable request . 717 718 Code Availability 719 All code generated to simulate and analyze the data presented in this study is available from the 720 corresponding author on reasonable request . 721 REAGENT OR IDENTIFIER SOURCE IDENTIFIER Hyaluronidase Sigma - Aldrich H3884 L - Cysteine Sigma - Aldrich C7352 Papain Sigma - Aldrich 76220 CellMask‚Ñ¢ Deep Red Invitrogen C10046 FM4 - 64 Invitrogen T13320 Fluo - 4 - AM Invitrogen F14201 Carboxyl latex bead 1¬µm Invitrogen C37274 Carboxyl latex bead 2¬µm Invitrogen C37278 Carboxyl latex bead 3¬µm Invitrogen C37281 Nifedipine abcam ab120235 MiTMAB abcam ab120466 Pro - Myristic acid abcam ab120476 Latrunculin A Cayman Chemical 10010630 Sir - Actin Spirochrome SC001 23 722 Methods references 723 724 16 Shi , Z . , Graber , Z .

After the force is 804 stabilized to its static value ùëì ‚Äô , the tether is extended at constant speed ( ùêøÃá = 1 ¬µm / s ) by moving 805 the cell away while the force acting on the bead ùëì ( ùë° ) is monitored .

The regions of interest marked with blue ( probe tether ) and 847 red ( pulling tether ) boxes were used to calculate the fluorescence intensities ( see Methods ) , 848 which were normalized to their initial values .

Fluorescence recovery in the bleached regions was 864 followed as a function of time . The intensity of the ROI for 4 frames prior to bleaching was 865 averaged and used for normalization of the pre - bleach intensity to 1 . Recovery was followed 866 initially at 0 . 773 frames / s for 30 frames , then at a lower rate ( 0 . 25 - 0 . 50 frames / s ) for the 867 remainder of the measurements to minimize photobleaching while capturing the initial rapid 868 phase . Recovery traces for every group were fit to an equation , with the mobile fraction of 869 protein ùúô 9 and the tracer diffusion coefficient ùê∑ ! estimated from the best - fit parameters ( see 870 Methods ) .

A pulling tether was extended from a bipolar cell 876 terminal by 40 Œºm at 1 Œºm / s , held for 30 s , then relaxed to its initial extension at 1 Œºm / s while a 877 probe tether measured the resulting membrane tension changes a distance ùëë away . Left , 878 34 schematic of the experiment . Right : individual measurements of membrane tension changes 879 ( black , solid ) , shown with the predicted tension changes at the probe tether assuming a 880 membrane tension diffusivity ùê∑ % = 0 . 024 Œºm 2 / s ( yellow , ref . 16 ) or a 100 - fold larger value 881 ( orange ) . The model 16 considers membrane flow through a random array of immobile obstacles 882 ( transmembrane domain proteins attached to the underlying cytoskeleton ) and predicts diffusive 883 propagation of membrane tension perturbations . The intermembrane distance ùëë for every 884 experiment is indicated . Agreement between simulations and measurements is poor in every 885 case . A good match is obtained only assuming ùëë = 0 . 1 Œºm ( black , dashed ) , suggesting the 886 tension perturbation created by the pulling tether is transmitted with little distance dependence to 887 the probe tether ( see Figure 2 ) . b . As in a , but both tethers were extruded from the soma ( blue 888 traces ) of bipolar neurons . c .

Schematic of the experiment . A 892 membrane tether was pulled from the cell surface , then the cell was moved ( by moving the xy 893 stage ) to create a tangential force ùëì ‚à• to drive sliding of the tether ' s base with velocity ùë£ ! ( see 894 Figure 3 and Methods for details ) . b . Cumulative distribution function ( CDF ) of tether - 895 membrane angles for bipolar cell terminals . Angles were smaller for LatA - treated cells , 896 indicating easier sliding and lower forces . c . Similar measurements for tethers drawn from 897 bipolar cell somata . d . Same as in c , for chromaffin cells . Angles were smaller for terminals and 898 somata compared to chromaffin cells , indicating easier sliding . LatA treatment shifted ùúÉ values 899 to lower values in terminals and somata , but not in chromaffin cells ( Kolmogorov - Smirnov test , 900 ùëù = 7 . 2 √ó 10 " < $ , 1 . 6 √ó 10 " < 1 , and 6 . 8 . √ó 10 " A for treated vs . untreated terminals , somata , 901 and chromaffin cells , respectively ) . e . Obstacle density for bipolar cell terminals and somata , and 902 chromaffin cells . Obstacles result in tether base stalling ( during which ùë£ ! < 0 . 5 Œºm / s ) despite 903 being subject to a substantial tangential force ( ùëì ‚à• > 5 pN ) . Obstacle density is defined as the 904 number of individual obstacles encountered during a trajectory , divided by the total distance 905 traveled by the tether base ( see Methods ) . 906 36 Extended Data Figure 9 | Additional experiments probing the relationship between 907 synaptic vesicle recycling and membrane tension changes . a . Top . Schematic of experiments 908 relating spontaneus exo - endocytic activity of bipolar neurons to membrane tension changes in 909 the terminal . A tether was extruded from the terminal using a bead held in an optical trap to 910 monitor membrane tension . The cell was pre - loaded with a fluorescent calcium indicator ( Fluo - 911 4 ) whose fluorescence intensity was monitored in the region of interest ( ROI ) indicated by the 912 dashed circle in the terminal . Two mM calcium was present in the extracellular medium . Some 913 cells develop spontaneous calcium action potentials ( monitored via Fluo - 4 fluorescence ) that 914 robustly drive exo - endocytosis 36 . Bottom : Snapshots from an image stack of a cell that 915 developed spontaneous calcium activity . Brightfield and fluorescence channels were alternated 916 ( 1 . 08 s between pairs of images ) . Scale bar = 5 Œºm . b . Quantification of the Fluo - 4 calcium 917 signals and membrane tension measurements for the example shown in a . Both the fluorescence 918 ( top , red ) and membrane tension ( bottom , blue ) are reported as changes relative to the initial 919 value ( ùõ•ùêπ / ùêπ ‚Äô or ùõ•ùúé / ùúé ‚Äô ) . Exocytosis occurs with the upstoke of the calcium wave , followed by 920 endocytosis restoring membrane area 36 . Note that calcium variations anti - correlate with 921 membrane tension changes , consistent with exocytosis lowering and endocytosis restoring 922 membrane tension , respectively . ( see Supplementary Movie 6 ) . Five other cells developed 923 spontaneous calcium activity during membrane tension measurements ; all such cells also 924 displayed anti - correlated membrane tension variations . c . Cross - correlation between calcium 925 signals and membrane tension for data shown in b .

Schematic of the 929 photostimulation protocol ( see Figure 4 ) . Calcium signals were integrated from the ROI shown 930 as a dashed red line in the terminal . e . When extracellular calcium was omitted , nifedipine 931 photolysis caused changes neither in calcium signals nor in membrane tension . f . When 932 endocytosis was inhibited with 10 ŒºM dynamin inhibitor MiTMAB , calcium signals and the 933 initial decrease in membrane tension were not affected , but the recovery of membrane tension 934 was compromised ( cf . Figure 4c ) . g . We used pro - myristic acid as a negative control for the 935 MiTMAB experiments . In the cell , pro - myristic acid is rapidly converted to myristic acid which 936 is not a dynamin inhibitor 51 . Membrane tension and calcium dynamics were not appreciably 937 altered compared to controls ( Figure 4c ) . In f and g , 2 mM extracellular calcium was present . 938
