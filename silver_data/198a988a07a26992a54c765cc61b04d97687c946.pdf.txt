It de - velops mostly within chronically sun - exposed areas of the skin . MCPyV is detected in 60 – 80 % of MCC cases as integrated within the genome and is considered a major risk factor for MCC . Viral negative MCCs have a high mutation burden with a UV damage signature . Aberrations occur in RB1 , TP53 , and NOTCH genes as well as in the PI3K - AKT - mTOR pathway . MCC is highly immuno - genic , but MCC cells are known to evade the host’s immune response . Despite the characteristic immunohistological proﬁle of MCC , the diagnosis is challenging , and it should be conﬁrmed by an experienced pathologist . Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered the most reliable staging tool to identify subclinical nodal disease . Subclinical node metastases are present in about 30 – 50 % of patients with primary MCC . The basis of MCC treatment is surgical excision . MCC is highly radiosensitive . It becomes chemoresistant within a few months . MCC is prone to recurrence . The outcomes in patients with metastatic disease are poor , with a historical 5 - year survival of 13 . 5 % . The median progression - free survival is 3 – 5 months , and the median overall survival is ten months . Currently , immunotherapy has become a standard of care ﬁrst - line therapy for advanced MCC . Keywords : Merkel cell carcinoma ; tumor mutational burden ; immunotherapy ; TP53 ; polyomavirus 1 . Introduction Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC ) is an uncommon and highly aggressive skin cancer developing within the dermis and subcutis . It has an immunophenotype ( Cytokeratin 20—CK20 ) corresponding to sensory Merkel cells of the skin—mechanoreceptor cells of the basal layer of the epidermis . More detailed analysis accumulating over the last years suggests that MCC cells ( CK20 + , CD56 + , CKAE1 / AE3 + , NSE + , PAX5 + , NSP + , TdT + , SATB2 + , TTF - 1 − , LCA − , S100 − , p40 − , chromogranin + / − , and synaptophysin + / − ) are not the progeny of mature Merkel cells ( Cytokeratin 20—CK20 + ) , and the true origin of MCC remains unknown [ 1 ] . There are a few hypotheses about the cellular origin of MCC , including deriving from epidermal and dermal stem cells , dermal ﬁbroblasts , as well Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / ijms22126305 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / ijms Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 2 of 39 as pre / pro B cells [ 2 ] . MCC incidence rate is estimated at 0 . 25 – 0 . 32 per 100 , 000 persons annually , reaching 9 . 8 per 100 , 000 persons annually among people older than 85 years . The incidence is increasing steeply , most likely due to the aging population , improved recognition , and rising awareness of MCC [ 3 ] . The 10 - year survival rate is estimated to be around 57 % [ 4 , 5 ] . The prevalence in men is 1 . 5 times higher than in women . It devel - ops within chronically sun - exposed areas of the skin and mostly affects the fair - skinned population at an advanced age . Around 30 – 50 % of MCC cases occur within the skin of the head , while other common sites are upper and lower extremities [ 4 , 6 ] . It is very rarely detected within oral or genital mucous membranes [ 7 ] . Immunosuppression , excessive UV exposure , and Merkel cell polyomavirus ( MCPyV ) infection are the greatest risk factors for MCC . In fact , MCC incidence is rising over the last years due to the aging of the popula - tion , increased sun exposure , and increased use of immunosuppressive medications [ 8 ] . Immunological disorders such as AIDS or hematological malignancies such as chronic lymphatic leukemia , as well as solid - organ transplantations and UV light , result in the impairment of the immune response , which plays a particularly important role in MCPyV + MCC development . In the process of non - viral - mediated carcinogenesis , ultraviolet radia - tion damages DNA [ 9 – 12 ] . MCPyV - MCCs contain numerous DNA mutations caused by UV damage , whereas MCPyV + MCCs have an incorporated viral genome and few muta - tions with “UV signature” . MCPyV - MCCs have between a 25 - and 90 - fold increased rate of UV - induced mutations compared to MCPyV + MCCs . Moreover , in the viral - mediated mechanism , the majority of genes are intact , and interaction between these wild - type genes and viral proteins results in the development of MCCs [ 9 , 13 , 14 ] . Additionally , the MCPyV + MCC patients have a three - fold higher 5 - year survival rate than MCPyV - MCC ones [ 15 ] . The median mutation burden in MCPyV - MCCs is estimated to be 1121 somatic single nucleotide variants ( SSNVs ) per exome with frequently downregulated RB1 and TP53 . Mutations affect genes responsible for chromatin modiﬁcations ( ASXL1 , MLL2 / 3 ) and DNA damage repair ( ATM , MSH2 , BRCA2 ) . Aberrations of x - Jun N - terminal kinases ( JNKs ) ( MAP3K1 , TRAF7 ) were also identiﬁed . Activation of the PI3K pathway and suppression of the NOTCH pathway are present in MCCs [ 14 ] . Virus - positive and virus - negative MCC of unknown primary origin ( MCC - UP ) exhibit an immune proﬁle similar to virus - positive and virus - negative primary cutaneous MCCs . Both virus - positive and - negative MCC - UP are immunogenic with high intratumoral PD - L1 expression as well as intratumoral CD8 and FoxP3 inﬁltrates . Moreover , MCPyV - negative MCC - UP tumors present typical UV signatures and high tumor mutational burden , and in contrast , low numbers of mutations are found in MCPyV - positive MCC - UPs [ 16 ] . The diagnostic clues for identiﬁcation of MCC can be described by the AEIOU acronym ( A—asymptomatic ; E—expanding rapidly ; I—immune - suppressed ; O—older than 50 years ; U—UV - exposed skin ) . While around 90 % of MCC patients fulﬁll at least three criteria , only in 7 % of them are all ﬁve detected . MCC is known to be solitary , and it is characterized as a ﬁrm , ﬂesh - colored , or red - violaceous nodule with a shiny and smooth surface . Telangiecta - sia could also be observed . Merkel cell carcinoma can be clinically indistinguishable from other cutaneous malignancies , such as amelanotic melanoma , squamous cell carcinoma , or basal cell carcinoma [ 7 , 17 , 18 ] . Nevertheless , the histopathological review from the excisional biopsy is essential to conﬁrm MCC diagnosis . In the microscopic examination , MCC manifests as expansile , nodular , or diffusely inﬁltrative lesions . Most MCC cases display neuroendocrine morphology . It consists of small blue cells with round or oval nuclei . There are plentiful active mitoses and apoptotic bodies . The nuclear – cytoplasmic ratio is high , and cytoplasm is scant . Granular chromatin creates “salt and pepper” nuclei , which are characteristic of neuroendocrine tumors . Further diagnosis is based on immuno - histochemical staining , which differentiates MCC cells ( CK20 + , CD56 + , CKAE1 / AE3 + , NSE + , PAX5 + , NSP + , TdT + , SATB2 + , TTF - 1 − , LCA − , S100 − , p40 − , chromogranin + / − , and synaptophysin + / − ) from other cancer cells such as basal cell carcinoma , metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma , lymphoma , or Ewing sarcoma . Additionally , radiological ex - aminations , including X - ray , computed tomography ( CT ) , and magnetic resonance imaging Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 3 of 39 ( MRI ) , allow detecting local and distant metastases ( Figure 1 ) [ 4 , 7 , 9 , 19 ] . The aforemen - tioned types of examinations reveal crucial prognostic factors such as the size of the primary lesion , the presence of regional lymph node involvement , and distant metastases . This information is vital to assess the stage of the lesion according to the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer ( AJCC ) TNM ( tumor – node – metastases ) criteria . The MCC stage determines further treatment and prognosis ( Figure 2 ) [ 4 , 20 ] . Most recently , in radiology reports , it has been shown that positron emission tomography / computed tomography ( PET / CT ) is an effective imaging tool in metastatic or unresectable MCC . In most reports , the glucose analog 18 F - ﬂuorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F - FDG ) was used as a ra - diotracer , although 68 Ga - labeled somatostatin analogs have been employed as well as 6 - ﬂuoro - ( 18 F ) - L - 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylalanine ( 18 F - DOPA ) . Nevertheless , currently , PET - CT is still inferior in sensitivity in detecting the early stages of MCC in comparison to sentinel lymph node biopsy , but an important role for 18 F - FDG PET / CT in the staging of MCC is expected [ 21 , 22 ] .

Merkel Cell Polyomavirus Within the polyomaviridae family of nonenveloped , icosahedral , double - stranded DNA viruses , 13 human polyomavirus ( HPyVs ) species have been discovered . HPyVs affect numerous human tissues such as the respiratory system , kidney , or skin , often causing asymptomatic , persistent infection . Nevertheless , they become active due to impairment of the immune system , resulting in severe diseases , including respiratory infections , allograft interstitial nephritis , hemorrhagic cystitis , multifocal leukoencephalopathy , and cancers . The risk of developing these diseases is particularly high in immunosuppressed patients after transplantation as well as after HIV infection [ 23 , 24 ] . Merkel cell polyomavirus ( MCPyV ) infection is ubiquitous amongst humans and is usually acquired in early childhood . No route of MCPyV transmission is validated , but saliva and / or skin - to - skin close contact , as well as the fecal – oral transmission route , are suggested . MCPyV was proven to have widespread tissue distribution with higher levels of MCPyV in the upper aerodigestive tract and digestive system in comparison to the genitourinary system or lungs . About 15 % of healthy individuals have MCPyV DNA on their skin . It mainly enters keratinocytes and dermal ﬁbroblasts . Seroprevalence for MCPyV depends on the examined population , but it presents a similar trend to increase with age with an estimated 53 – 96 . 2 % overall MCPyV seroprevalence [ 25 – 35 ] . Once acquired , MCPyV becomes a life - long resident of human skin ﬂora [ 35 ] . The copy number of integrated viral genomes varies from cell to cell , with a median of three viral copies per cell . Patients with a viral load higher than one copy per cell have better overall survival than MCPyV - ones . Detection of the virus in the blood is associated with worse outcomes [ 36 , 37 ] . Initially , MCPyV is latent , nonreplicative after infection , and detected in 60 – 80 % of MCC cases as integrated within the genome [ 38 , 39 ] . MCPyV has a circular , double - stranded DNA genome of 5387 base pairs . It is divided into the bidirectional early and late regions , which are separated by a non - coding regulatory region ( NCRR ) containing the viral replication origin . NCRR comprises an AT - rich tract , LT - binding domain , and early enhancer region . The late region consists of viral coat proteins VP1 and VP2 , while the presence of VP3 is questionable , as well as miRNA , which acts on T antigen transcripts . The early region encodes large T antigen ( LT ) and small T antigen ( ST ) as well as 57kT . Moreover , in the process of the alternative translation initiation , an alternative frame of the large T open reading frame ( ALTO ) is expressed . While the functions of 57kT and ALTO have not been identiﬁed , LT and ST play an important role in viral replication [ 9 , 36 , 40 , 41 ] . LT consists of an N - terminal DnaJ domain , an MCPyV unique region ( MUR ) , a DNA origin binding domain ( OBD ) , the zinc ﬁnger domain ( ZF ) , and a helicase domain / ATPase . The N - terminal DnaJ domain comprises a CR1 ( conserved region 1 ) motif and an HPDKGG motif that binds Hsc70 . MUR contains an LXCXE motif ( pRB binding motif ) and a nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) , and it binds to Vam6p , redistributing it to the nucleus . Moreover , the pRB binding motif presents a complementary sequence for an MCPyV viral miRNA . The C - terminal region of LT is thought to bind p53 by interaction with some bridging protein or one that changes LT conformation [ 42 , 43 ] . LT is responsible for viral replication not only by having a C - terminal DNA origin binding domain , but also by acting like a helicase , unwinding viral DNA . Additionally , it mobilises host cellular DNA polymerases [ 9 , 36 , 40 , 41 , 43 ] . ST shares a DnaJ domain with LT and at its C - terminal region contains two zinc - binding domains ( CXCXXC motif ) , which are responsible for ST stability , and two domains rich in cysteine and proline , forming a protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) binding site . ST is essential for stabilizing LT by its LT stabilizing domain ( LSD ) , increasing the effectiveness of the viral replication process ( Figure 3 ) [ 9 , 36 , 40 , 41 , 43 ] . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 6 of 39 Figure 3 . MCPyV genome and large T antigen structure . MCPyV genome consists of early and late regions . The late region comprises viral coat proteins VP1 and VP2 , while the presence of VP3 is questionable . The early region encodes large T antigen ( LT ) and small T antigen ( ST ) . When the early region undergoes alternative splicing , it produces 57kT . Moreover , in the process of the alternative translation initiation , an alternative frame of the large T open reading frame ( ALTO ) is expressed . Large T antigen consists of an N - terminal DnaJ domain , an MCPyV unique region ( MUR ) , a DNA origin binding domain ( OBD ) , the zinc ﬁnger domain ( ZF ) , and a helicase domain / ATPase . The N - terminal DnaJ domain comprises a CR1 ( conserved region 1 ) motif and an HPDKGG motif . MUR contains an LXCXE motif ( pRB binding motif ) and a nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) . Attachment of MCPyV requires sulfated polysaccharides like heparan sulfates and / or chondroitin sulfates and sialic acid as a coreceptor . It is internalized in small endocytic pits and enters the process of caveolar / lipid raft - mediated endocytosis . Microtubular transport , acidiﬁcation of endosomes , and redox environment are essential in the trafﬁcking . A minority of viruses are transported to the endoplasmic reticulum , while others remain at endosomal compartments . It is suggested that endosome - to - ER trafﬁcking is one of the most signiﬁcant limitations in MCPyV infection [ 44 , 45 ] . MCPyV DNA integration within the host genome displays a clonal pattern ; thus , it is suggested that MCPyV infection precedes clonal expansion of MCC cells [ 39 , 46 ] . MCPyV infection is facilitated by matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) , especially MMP1 , MMP3 , and MMP10 , which degrade the extracellular matrix of the cell , providing MCPyV easier access to its surface . The induction of MMP expression is stimulated by epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , ﬁbroblast growth factor ( FGF ) , and inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( GSK3 ) , inducing WNT / β - catenin signaling . The WNT signaling pathway is also increased by classical clinical Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 7 of 39 MCC risk factors , such as UV radiation and aging , which in this way facilitate MCPyV infection [ 1 , 32 , 40 ] . Viral integration into the human genome is reported within most chromosomes across genes . The site of MCPyV integration is unique for every tumor and thereby determines its further development . Nevertheless , due to the lack of integrase , integration is not a part of the MCPyV natural cell cycle . At the sites of microhomology between the host and MCPyV genomes , the mechanism of erroneous DNA repair is observed . It enables the virus to integrate into the human genome , mainly into transcriptionally active gene - dense regions and accessible chromatin as well as near short interspersed nuclear elements ( SINEs ) , B double prime one , and a subunit of RNA polymerase III transcription initiation factor IIIB ( BDP1 ) binding sites . Moreover , MCPyV tropism toward sensory perception and G - protein coupled receptor genes was suggested [ 46 – 48 ] . After infection , MCPyV enters in viral latency , which means that its genome does not replicate independently and it does not produce any infectious particles . Thus , a wide array of MCPyV mechanisms promotes this state . Highly phosphorylated LT protein initiates MCPyV genome replication by binding to the DNA replication origin . LT expression is suppressed by the autoinhibition of its own promoter in a negative feedback loop [ 49 ] . Additionally , the interaction between LT and RB1 results in activation of p14 ( ARF ) , which increases the cellular level of p53 [ 43 ] . Moreover , MCPyV encodes MCV - miR - M1 - 3p and MCV - miR - M1 - 5p single miRNAs , which are located on the antisense strand of the LT . MCV - miR - M1 displays a sequence complementary to the LXCXE motif in the LT mRNA transcript , repressing it . Additionally , MCV - miR - M1 targets antiviral protein SP100 , causing decreased secretion of CXCL8 in consequence , leading to neutrophil chemotaxis depletion . The host immune evasion promotes persistent , long - term infection of MCPyV [ 50 ] . Additionally , LT phosphorylation sites are recognized by Skp - Celli - F box ( SCF ) E3 ubiquitin ligases F - box / WD repeat - containing protein 7 ( Fbw7 ) , F - box / WD repeat - containing protein 1A ( β TrCP ) , and S - phase kinase - associated protein 2 ( Skp2 ) , which results in degradation of LT and preserves its low cellular level . Moreover , adverse cellular conditions , such as nutrient starvation , which inhibit the mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) kinase , LT mutations in phosphorylation sites , or downregulation of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases lead to accumulation of LT proteins and replication of MCPyV and initiate spreading to uninfected cells or to a new host [ 49 ] . In fact , oncogenic transformation by MCPyV requires two molecular events : integra - tion of the MCP genome into the human genome and truncation of LT that makes the virus non - replicating . Mutations of MCPyV result in truncated LT ( tLT ) . LT is truncated by premature stop codons or deletions that lead to loss of the C - terminal origin binding ( OBD ) and helicase domains , which are vital for MCPyV replication [ 36 ] . tLT preserves the pRB1 - binding domain ( LXCXE motif ) , which binds the cellular tumor suppressor retinoblastoma - associated protein ( RB1 gene ) and thereby releases elongation factor 2 ( EF2 ) , promoting progression to the S phase of the cell cycle [ 9 ] . tLT also retains the DnaJ chaperone , which allows it to interact with Heat shock 70 kDa protein 8 ( Hsc70 ) , releasing EF2 from RB1 and stimulating MCPyV replication [ 51 ] . It also stimulates the expression of protein atonal homolog 1 ( ATOH1 ) and SRY - box transcription factor 2 ( SOX2 ) . tLT is known to promote tumor growth more strongly than wild - type LT or 57kT [ 11 ] . Expression of the C - terminal 100 amino acids inhibits the growth of MCPyV + MCC , but the mech - anism is not known . It could be related to cell cycle checkpoint kinase , including ataxia telangiectasia mutated serine / threonine kinase ( ATM ) , casein kinase 2 β ( CSNK2B ) , and phosphatidylinositol - 5 - phosphate 4 - kinase type 2 β ( PIP4K2B ) , which alter cell proliferation by inhibiting progress from G1 to S cell cycle and promoting apoptosis [ 11 ] . Ubiquitin - speciﬁc protease 7 ( Usp7 ) binds with all MCPyV T - antigens , including LT , tLT , and 57kT , and probably in an indirect way with ST , suppressing MCPyV replication [ 52 ] . Additionally , either LT or ST decreases tumor cell autophagy by increasing the expression of miRNAs , such as miR - 30a - 3p , miR - 30a - 5p , and miRNA - 375 . Those miRNAs have complementary sequences within mRNAs that take part in the production of autophagy proteins , such as autophagy - related 7 ( ATG7 ) , sequestosome 1 ( SQSTM1 , p62 ) , and beclin 1 ( BECN1 ) . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 8 of 39 Interaction between miRNAs and mRNAs results in a decreased level of those autophagy proteins [ 53 ] . ST expression is required in the development of MCPyV + MCC . ST protein plays a signiﬁcant role in promoting mitogenesis and cell proliferation by upregulation of the PI3K - AKT - mTOR signaling pathway , which initiates cap - dependent translation ( Figure 4 ) . To promote this type of translation , eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E ( eIF4E ) has to bind with eIF4A and eIF4G , creating multisubunit eIF4F . By mTOR phosphorylation of 4E - binding protein 1 ( 4E - BP1 ) , it releases eIF4E , allowing it to start the cap - dependent translation . ST acts downstream in this pathway , leading to increased MCC growth by persistent hyperphosphorylation of 4E - BP1 [ 54 ] . Moreover , ST binds and inhibits protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) , thus maintaining AKT in a phosphorylated and active form . It also promotes the induction of the proglycolytic genes . ST inhibits particular E3 ubiquitin ligases , which normally take part in cell cycle regulation . It is known to promote centrosome overduplication ( supernumerary centrosomes ) and aneuploidy by targeting E3 ligases and on account of overlapping E3 ligase networks . It also induces the formation of micronuclei [ 55 , 56 ] . Additionally , the interaction between small T antigen and NF - κ B essential modulator ( NEMO ) leads to the inhibition of I κ B kinase α ( IKK α ) / IKK β - mediated I κ B phosphorylation , which regulates NF - κ B heterodimer translocation to the nucleus [ 57 ] . ST binds to L - myc - 1 proto - oncogene protein ( MYCL ) , thereby regulating EP400 histone acetyltransferase and chromatin remodeling complex , which results in changed gene expression [ 38 , 58 ] . ST has an LT stabilizing domain ( LSD ) , which increases the level of LT and enables it to disrupt the function of F - box / WD repeat - containing protein 7 ( FBXW7 ) and cell division cycle protein 20 homolog ( CDC20 ) . The LSD domain plays a crucial role in MCPyV + MCC development [ 9 , 11 , 36 , 38 ] . Figure 4 . PI3K – AKT – mTOR pathway .

Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 9 of 39 MCC patients are not contagious due to a tumor - related mutation in LT where the helicase domain is eliminated . tLT prevents autonomous replication of the viral genome , thus making MCPyV non - transmittable . Moreover , viral replication is inhibited by E3 ligase targeting of phosphorylated LT , downregulation of MCPyV promoter by LT , as well as underexpression of LT due to viral microRNA [ 38 , 49 , 59 ] . 3 . Immunogenicity of Merkel Cell Carcinoma The association between increased Merkel cell carcinoma incidence and mortality rate and pathological immune dysfunction suggests a signiﬁcant role of the immune system in MCC development . Approximately 10 % of all MCC patients have decreased immunity . Alterations in the immune system are observed in the course of solid organ transplantation immunosuppression , chronic inﬂammatory conditions , HIV infection / AIDS , and hemato - logical malignancies . A 30 - fold higher MCC incidence is observed among patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia [ 6 , 38 , 60 – 64 ] . Withdrawal of immune - suppressive treatment , as well as spontaneous regressions , are suggested to be linked with immune - cell mediated responses consisting of T cells and macrophages [ 65 , 66 ] . Ultraviolet radiation ( UVR ) also contributes to suppressed immunity due to the excess production of cytokine IL - 10 and the generation of Tr1 - like regulatory T cells . Both take part in the inhibition of Th1 and Th2 cells , which are essential for humoral immune response development [ 67 ] . As the cellular immune system is known to be pivotal in regulating MCC prevention and development , dense intratumoral inﬁltration , especially with CD8 T cells , is associated with a favorable prognosis [ 68 – 70 ] . MCPyV - speciﬁc CD4 and CD8 T - cell epitopes are observed in tumors and blood from MCPyV + MCC patients . A higher number of MCPyV - speciﬁc T cells is observed within the tumor environment than in the blood . T cells could identify LT and ST oncoproteins as well as capsid structural protein antigens [ 71 ] . The MCPyV VP1 capsid protein was reported to not be expressed by MCPyV + MCC , resulting in the lack of VP1 - related responses in the tumor - inﬁltrated lymphocytes ( TILs ) . However , anti - VP1 T cells are identiﬁed in peripheral blood lymphocytes [ 33 , 72 ] . In LT - and ST - directed responses , there is no difference between intratumoral and peripheral lymphocytes . While VP1 antigen - speciﬁc T cells are detected in both MCPyV + MCC patients and the healthy MCPyV + population , T - cell responses to the LT and ST antigens are observed only in MCPyV + MCC patients . Additionally , LT and ST antigen - speciﬁc T cells were detected to be present even three years after removal of the primary lesion , which could be explained by the appearance of memory T - cell response [ 73 , 74 ] . Intratumoral TCR clonality could be interpreted as a marker of cell - antigen variety . While the intratumoral TCR repertoire in MCPyV + MCC is clonal , MCPyV - MCC is known to have more diverse TCR due to its higher mutational burden . This phenomenon results from altered antigen expression caused by the presence of gene mutations . Those neoantigens are mostly patient - speciﬁc , and they could be used for future personalized treatment . Nevertheless , some data show that MCPyV + MCC could have greater immunogenicity than virus - negative MCC , despite its higher mutational burden and neoantigen expression [ 14 , 74 – 76 ] . CD4 T cells , also known as T helpers , have a diverse impact on the immune system . They play an essential role in immune system stimulation by releasing cytokines and mediators , and they are also required for activation of CD8 T cells , increasing cross - presentation of antigen - presenting cells , and enhancing phagocyte function . CD4 Th1 cells produce interferon - γ ( INF - γ ) , which is an important antiviral cytokine , while CD4 Th2 cells are the source of IL - 10 , an anti - inﬂammatory cytokine that suppresses Th1 and NK cells , as well as IL - 13 , which acts either as a promoter or inhibitor of tumor development [ 73 ] . Moreover , they are responsible for the stimulation of B cell antibody class switching . One study found that speciﬁc CD4 T cells with diverse receptor sequences were identiﬁed in 76 % of assessed MCCs , and their concentration was 250 - fold higher within the tumor environment than in the peripheral blood . The frequency of CD4 T cells is much lower in comparison with CD8 ones ; thus , research concerning tumor - speciﬁc CD4 T cells is more difﬁcult . Nevertheless , identifying MCC - speciﬁc CD4 T - cell epitopes enables the Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 10 of 39 development of CD4 - targeted therapies besides CD8 - based treatment [ 71 , 77 ] . The presence of tumor - associated neutrophil inﬁltration results in a longer recurrence - free period and increased overall survival . Additionally , tertiary lymphoid structures ( TLS ) located near MCC also correlate with prolonged recurrence - free survival due to exceeded CD8 / CD4 ratio in the tumor periphery , but not in its center [ 78 ] . Seroprevalence for MCPyV depends on the examined population , but it presents a similar trend to increase with age , with an estimated 53 – 96 . 2 % overall MCPyV seropreva - lence [ 29 – 31 , 33 , 34 ] . As observed in the cellular immune response , anti - VP1 antibodies are present in both MCPyV + MCC patients and the healthy MCPyV + population , while MCPyV large and small tumor - associated antigen antibodies are produced exclusively by MCPyV + MCC patients . Thus , screening of anti - LT and anti - ST oncoprotein antibody levels is useful in the disease progression and recurrence monitoring when anti - VP1 an - tibody titer could be a prognostic marker at the baseline . MCPyV + MCC patients with high antibody titers are thought to have a better progression - free survival , but there is no association with any tumor characteristics [ 72 , 76 , 79 – 82 ] . Merkel cell carcinoma immune evasion is the process that impairs the patients’ im - mune system , facilitating MCC progression ( Figure 5 ) . One of those mechanisms is altered HLA I expression , resulting from genomic modiﬁcations or transcriptional regulation . In the former one , mutations or loss - of - heterozygosity in HLA genes are observed , while tran - scriptional suppression is mostly based on epigenetic alterations , such as hypermethylation , and is reversible in the ex vivo cultures by both interferon - γ ( INF - γ ) and the hypomethy - lating agent 5 - azacytidine . INF - γ binds with the IFN receptor , which phosphorylates Janus kinase 1 and 2 as well as the signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 1 ( JAK1 / JAK2 / STAT1 ) , activating them . STAT1 stimulates interferon regulatory factor 1 ( IRF - 1 ) expression , which in turn upregulates MHC I expression [ 83 ] . To avoid immune resistance to cellular immunotherapy resulting from loss of particular HLA expression , the patient requires T - cell treatment , which is targeted to alternate HLAs whose expression is not decreased . Acquired immunotherapy resistance in the mechanism of transcriptional HLA downregulation is the consequence of MCC therapy restricted to a particular HLA T cell . It is also potentially reversible with drug treatment [ 84 ] . Antigen - speciﬁc T - cell re - sponses are restricted only by a few HLA contexts , which could be caused by transcriptional loss of HLA expression on account of speciﬁc T - cell pressure [ 74 ] . Even when intratumoral CD8 T cells are present , they often show an exhausted phenotype that suppresses the immune response . It is characterized by a reduced expression of CD69 and CD25 , which are the markers of early and late T - cell activation , respectively . Moreover , exhausted T cells have upregulated expression of programmed cell death 1 ( PD - 1 ) , T - cell immunoglobulin and mucin - domain containing - 3 ( TIM3 ) , and cytotoxic T - lymphocyte associated protein 4 ( CTLA - 4 ) , whose functions are described below . After in vitro treatment of MCC with IL - 2 and IL - 15 , increased production of various cytokines , such as IFN γ , TNF α , IL - 17 , IL - 10 , IL - 4 , and IL - 13 , was observed , which enhances immune system activity . Additionally , repertoire skewing of TCR expression and upregulation of CD137 were also identiﬁed . CD137 increases T - cell proliferation , cytolytic activity , as well as IL - 2 production [ 73 , 85 ] . Another sign of immune avoidance is the enhanced number of suppressive CD25 + FOX3P + Tregs with the downregulation / lack of activated CD25 + FOXP - T cells within the tumor environment . Moreover , CD4 and CD8 CD25 + FOX3P + Tregs increase CTLA - 4 , GITR , and HLA - DR expression , escalating immunosuppression . HLA - DR is thought to have high suppressive capacity . The proliferation of CD8 + FOX3P + Tregs is promoted by CD123 + plasmacytoid dendritic cells , which are located within the MCC environment [ 73 ] . Immune evasion is supported by macrophages switching from the M1 phenotype during tumor initiation toward M2 macrophages within the MCC development process . Their polariza - tion depends on transcription factors , including phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 ( STAT1 ) , recombination signal binding protein for immunoglob - ulin kappa J region ( RBP - J ) , or MAF bZIP transcription factor ( CMAF ) . M2 macrophage colonies could be stimulated by IL - 4 / IL - 13 , IL - 1 β / LPS with immune complex , and IL - Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 11 of 39 10 / TGF β / glucocorticoids . While classically activated M1 macrophages , stimulated by INF - γ and LPS , contribute to the Th1 response , alternatively activated M2 macrophages promote Th2 cells as well as tissue repair . Overall , M2 macrophage dominance supports tumor progression [ 86 , 87 ] . MHC class I chain - related protein ( MIC ) A and B production is stimulated by either viral infection or malignancy . MIC is known to take part in cell stress transmission within the immune system . It eliminates target cells by using Natural Killer group 2D ( NKG2D ) . NKG2D ligands , such as MIC , make altered cells more vulnerable to NK cell - dependent tumor lysis . Hypoacetylation of the MIC promoter leads to its epige - netic silencing , resulting in its decreased expression . Moreover , MIC proteolytic shedding from the tumor cell surface results in decreased lesion recognition of NK cells , and the ex - panding amount of soluble NKG2D ligands in the tumor microenvironment causes NKG2D internalization and suppresses NK cell activity . These phenomena could be observed in MCC patients , causing facilitated development of the tumor [ 88 – 90 ] . Toll - like receptor 9 ( TLR - 9 ) is stimulated by unmethylated cytosine – phosphate - guanine dinucleotides , which are located in bacterial as well as viral DNA . TLR - 9 is constantly expressed both in plas - macytoid dendritic cells and B cells . It is also identiﬁed in neutrophils , monocytes , and CD4 T cells . TLR - 9 ligands contribute to anti - tumor immune response . To prevent TLR - 9 - mediated activation of immune cells and promote tumor growth , LT and ST MCC antigens silence expression of this receptor [ 91 – 96 ] . CD47 , as well as CD200 overexpression , is also detected in MCC patients . CD200R is located in human monocytes and macrophages , and its activation by CD200 promotes immunosuppressive M2 polarization with increased IL - 10 production and Tregs induction . On the other hand , CD47 binds to SIPR α receptor on macrophages , preventing phagocytosis of altered cells [ 38 , 97 , 98 ] . Figure 5 . Merkel cell carcinoma immune evasion . To evade host immune response , MCC cells increase PD - L1 , CD47 , CD200 , and HLA - DR expression . Boosted PD - 1 / PD - L1 , CTLA - 4 / CD80 , or CD86 and TIM3 / CEACAM1 or galectin - 9 interactions as well as decreased MCH1 / TCR one result in immunosuppression . Overexpression of CD47 and CD200 , promoting M2 macrophage polarization . In MCC cells , MICA / MICB and TLR9 expression is downregulated . Higher soluble MICA / MICB concentration causes NKG2D internalization and suppresses NK cell activity . Reduced expression of CD69 and CD25 , which are the markers of T - cell activation , is observed . Moreover , the proliferation of CD8 + FOX3P + Tregs is promoted by CD123 + plasmacytoid dendritic cells , which are located within the MCC environment . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 12 of 39 3 . 1 . PD - 1 / PD - L1 Signaling in MCC One of the most important immune escape mechanisms is increased expression of PD - 1 either in tumor - inﬁltrating or peripheral antigen - speciﬁc T cells and upregulated PD - L1 expression at the surface of tumor cells , intratumoral macrophages , and peritumoral immune cells . PD - L1 shares homology with B7 . 1 ( CD80 ) and B7 . 2 ( CD86 ) [ 78 , 99 ] . PD - 1 / PD - L1 signaling suppresses the immune response in peripheral tissues in order to prevent damage to normal unchanged cells . The PD - 1 pathway is considered to suppress already activated T cells at the tissue sites . Normally , PD - 1L expression is detected on leukocytes and other cells , including those that are located within nonlymphoid tissues . Upregulation of PD - L1 is caused by inhibitory pathways , for instance resulting from IFN - γ interaction or tumor signaling . PD - L2 is expressed mainly on dendritic cells and monocytes . Nevertheless , it is also presented on a diverse group of other cells [ 100 – 103 ] . The PD - 1 / PD - L1 pathway enables MCC to avoid the immune system , resulting in undisturbed expansion . Approximately 42 – 49 % of MCCs , 55 % of TILs , and 39 % of peritumoral macrophages have a strong PD - L1 expression . Neither age nor sex nor initial diagnosis was associated with PD - L1 and PD - 1 number in cells . Moderate or high TIL inﬁltration correlates with 100 % PD - L1 expression by MCC cells . High PD - L1 expression and brisk lymphocyte response were exclusively demonstrated by MCPyV + MCC compared to MCPyV - MCC . Those ﬁndings suggest that tumor - speciﬁc , potentially MCPyV - antigens , increase tumor PD - 1L expression ; hence , virus - positive MCC is considered to have greater immunogenicity in comparison to virus - negative MCC due to better response to PD - 1 / PD - L1 blocking therapies . PD - 1 / PD - L1 signaling is a great therapeutic approach in the immune checkpoint inhibitor MCC therapy [ 75 , 78 , 99 ] . Moreover , PD - L1 and PD - L2 , which are both detected in the MCC microenvironment , are expressed by CD11c + inﬁltrating dendritic cells as well as a subpopulation of CD163 + macrophages , instead of being produced by tumor cells [ 73 ] . 3 . 2 . Other Immune Receptors in MCC OX40 ( CD134 , TNFRSF4 ) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) superfamily . It is expressed both in activated CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as on Tregs . CD4 T cells are considered to have more persistent expression of OX40 , while CD8 T cells are more likely to have transient expression . Neither most memory T cells nor naïve T cells have OX40 on their surface . TCR – MHC interaction , activation of other costimulatory receptors , including CD28 , as well as the presence of proinﬂammatory cytokines , such as IL - 1 , IL - 2 , IL - 4 , or TNF , in the microenvironment lead to enhanced OX40 expression . Moreover , OX40 contributes to the two stages of Tregs development . The ﬁrst one is driven by TCR signals with additional OX40 – OX40L co - stimulation , while the second process is TCR - independent and also requires IL - 2 and OX40 – OX40L interaction [ 104 ] . Conventionally , OX40L is present on antigen - presenting cells ( APC ) , but it is also detected on NK cells , mast cells , vascular endothelial cells , and smooth muscle cells [ 105 – 107 ] . Its upregulation results from the presence of inﬂammatory cytokines , including GM - CSF , IL - 1 , IL - 2 , IL - 12 , IL - 15 , TNF , and thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP ) , as well as by interaction with the NK cell receptor—NKG2D [ 108 – 110 ] . OX40 is expressed on T cells early after antigen activation , while upregulation of OX40L is observed in APC only within an acute inﬂammatory microenvironment [ 111 ] . OX40 and OX40L interaction enhances T - cell clonal expansion , effector differentiation , and survival , resulting in greater immune response . Increased cytokine secretion , such as IL - 2 , IL - 4 , IL - 5 , and IFN - γ by CD4 T cells , is also observed as a result of OX40 stimulation . Additionally , OX40 - stimulated T cells with expression of BCL - 2 , BCL - XL , and survivin play an important role in clonal proliferation of memory T cells [ 112 – 115 ] . As MCC is known to evade the immune response , downregulation of OX40 and OX40L could be observed . Thus , OX40 agonist treatment enhances anti - tumor immunity and could contribute to MCC regression [ 38 , 114 , 116 ] . Glucocorticoid - induced TNFR - related protein ( GITR , TNFRSF18 ) , as an OX40 , is a mem - ber of the TNFR superfamily . GITR is expressed on T and NK cells , and it is activated by GITRL , which is identified on APC and endothelial cells . GITR was detected on CD8 + FOX3P + Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 13 of 39 T cells and on CD4 + Tregs within the intratumoral environment of MCC [ 73 ] . Due to co - stimulation of T cells and NK cells , suppression of Tregs , and macrophages and DC activation , GITR – GITRL interaction leads to the development of immune response against infection and tumor [ 117 ] . The therapeutic targeting of GITR might inhibit Tregs while enhancing CD8 + T cells , hence providing the clinical benefits in MCC treatment [ 118 , 119 ] . CD28 , which binds either to CD80 or CD86 , results in increased proliferation , survival , and differentiation of T cells due to IL - 2 expression , metabolism upregulation , and higher expression of cell survival genes [ 101 ] . CTLA - 4 ( CD152 ) , a CD28 homolog , has opposed activity to CD28 , being a negative regulator of T - cell proliferation and activity . As with other checkpoint pathways , it plays an essential role in preventing autoimmunity by supporting peripheral tolerance . CTLA - 4 is thought to inhibit potentially autoreactive T cells during the initial stage of immune response development , especially in lymph nodes [ 100 ] . On account of CTLA - 4 expression in MCC , tumor cells are vulnerable to anti - CTLA - 4 antibody treatment . Moreover , interaction between anti - CTLA - 4 antibodies and CTLA - 4 on tumor cells results in activation of the EGFR pathway , which leads to increased PD - L1 expression . Upregulated PD - L1 expression induces a greater response to anti - PD - 1 treatment [ 120 , 121 ] . Moreover , the recombinant forms of CTLA - 4 ligands cause tumor cell apoptosis by inducing caspase - 8 and caspase - 3 [ 122 ] . Besides PD - 1 , MCC - targeting T cells express signiﬁcantly more T - cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain - containing protein 3 ( TIM3 ) than normal ones . TIM3 is detected on CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes , and it is deﬁned as a “co - receptor” . It plays a signiﬁcant role in immune suppression after binding to its two ligands , galectin 9 and carcinoembryonic antigen - related cell adhesion molecule 1 ( CEACAM1 ) . Activation of TIM3 results in releas - ing HLA - B - associated transcript 3 ( BAT3 ) , and it also increases interaction with the tyrosine kinase FYN [ 123 , 124 ] . It also has an impact on CD45 and CD148 [ 125 ] . Hence , TIM3 leads to immune synapse disruption and phosphatase recruitment , as well as participating in apoptosis . It is suggested that TIM3 function depends on the presence of a main inhibitory signal ; thus , due to the lack of suppressing motif , it might even act as a co - stimulatory receptor . Both PD - 1 and TIM3 are co - expressed and upregulated on dysfunctional T cells ; thus , co - blockade of TIM3 and PD - 1 in MCC therapy is promising [ 85 , 126 ] . 4 . Mutational Tumor Burden The mutational tumor burden of Merkel cell carcinoma varies signiﬁcantly between virus - negative and virus - positive MCCs . MCPyV - MCCs have a higher overall mutational rate with the median of 1121 somatic single nucleotide variants ( SSNVs ) compared to 12 . 5 SSNVs in MCPyV + MCCs . The number of SSNVs ranges from 3 to 4707 per exome [ 14 ] . Another study found 10 . 09 ± 2 . 32 mutations / Mb in MCPyV - tumors and 0 . 40 ± 0 . 09 muta - tions / Mb in MCPyV + [ 13 ] . MCPyV - and MCPyV + MCCs median numbers of neoantigens were estimated to be 173 and 7 SSNVs per exome , respectively . That is the reason why intratumoral TCR repertoire in MCPyV + MCC is clonal while MCPyV - MCC is known to have more diverse TCR . UV - mediated tumorigenesis is represented by a speciﬁc type of mutation , which is C to T transitions . Enrichment of UV - induced mutations was detected in 66 – 85 % of MCPyV - MCCs , while in MCPyV + MCCs they were not identiﬁed . The typical mutational signature of virus - positive MCCs has not been investigated . Mutational burden , as well as the number of C to T transitions , does not correlate with the primary MCC site and the patient’s age [ 13 , 14 ] . Those observations indicate diverse mechanisms of different types of MCC development . 5 . Deregulated Genes and Signaling Pathways 5 . 1 . RB1 Gene The RB1 gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein called pRB , which acts by inhibit - ing cell cycle progression . pRB forms a complex with E2F , binding to its transactivation domain and maintaining the cell in the G1 phase . This complex binds to promoters of the genes essential for the transition to the S phase , repressing their transcription . pRB also Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 14 of 39 remodels the chromatin structure by interaction with the proteins responsible for nucle - osome remodeling , histone de - acetylation , and methylation , including SWItch / Sucrose Non - Fermentable ( SWI / SNF ) proteins , brahma - related gene - 1 ( BRG1 ) , histone deacety - lase 1 ( HDAC1 ) , DNA ( cytosine - 5 ) - methyltransferase 1 ( DNMT1 ) , and heterochromatin protein 1 ( HP1 ) [ 127 ] . The copy loss of the RB1 gene is detected in 45 – 63 . 5 % of MCPyV - MCC cases ; thus , LT - negative tumors are mostly also pRB - negative [ 13 , 14 ] . Additionally , there is a signiﬁcant association between tumor RB1 and viral LT antigen expression in MCPyV + MCCs [ 128 , 129 ] . In MCPyV + MCCs , a viral truncated large T antigen binds to pRB by the LXCXE motif—MCPyV - LT potently . Inactivation of pRB by MCPyV - LT is sufﬁcient for MCC tumor growth out of MCPyV - positive MCC cells ( Figure 6 ) [ 130 ] . Addi - tional mechanisms indicated as inducing pRB downregulation in MCC are 13q deletions within the RB1 locus , RB1 promoter hypermethylation , truncating nonsense mutations , and miRNA - induced downregulation of expression [ 128 , 131 , 132 ] . Despite the difference in the mechanisms , in both viral and non - viral MCC , a lack of functional RB1 results in an uncontrollable proliferation of the altered cells . This pathologic process underlies MCC carcinogenesis [ 9 , 13 ] . Figure 6 . Alterations of pRB and p53 functioning in MCC . Truncated LT MCPyV inhibits pRB , causing E2F release and G1 to S phase transition . ST MCPyV binds to EP400 and MYCL , thus resulting in p53 downregulation as well as MDM4 overexpression by targeting MDM2 and CK1 α . In contrast , LT MCPyV induces accumulation of p14 ( ARF ) , which inhibits MDM2 , thereby releasing p53 . ( ATM—ATM serine / threonine kinase , ATR—ATR serine / threonine kinase , Chk1 / Chk2—checkpoint kinase 1 / 2 , CDK2—cyclin - dependent kinase 2 , CDK4 / 6—cyclin - dependent kinase 4 / 6 , CKDI— cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor , MYCL—MYCL proto - oncogene , bHLH transcription factor , EP400—E1A binding protein p400 , MDM2—MDM2 proto - oncogene , MDM4—MDM4 regulator of p53 , CK1 α —casein kinase 1 α , LT—large T antigen , ST—small T antigen ) . 5 . 2 . TP53 Gene Tumor protein p53 ( TP53 ) , also known as the “guardian of the genome” , is a well - known tumor suppressor gene . It maps on the short arm of chromosome 17 ( 17p13 . 1 ) . It is involved in cell cycle regulation , apoptosis induction , and DNA repair [ 133 ] . The frequency of TP53 inactivating mutations has been estimated to be between 10 % and 87 . 5 % [ 13 , 14 , 134 – 136 ] . MCPyV - MCCs frequently contain inactivating mutations of TP53 or its deletions , while Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 15 of 39 in MCPyV + MCCs , TP53 was reported mostly not to be mutated , but its activity was downregulated [ 9 , 13 ] . In fact , both in MCPyV - negative and in MCPyV - positive cases , TP53 inactivating mutations were reported [ 136 ] . Very recently , a complicated loop of molecular interactions was discovered in MCC pathogenesis . MCPyV LT that binds to pRB induces accumulation of p14 ( ARF ) ( cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor 2A ; p14 ) that physiologically is an inhibitor of MDM2 ( p53 ubiquitin ligase ) . At the same time , expression of ST reduced p53 activity . MCPyV ST recruits MYCL proto - oncogene to the EP400 chromatin remodeling complex that decreases p53 expression—MCPyV complex inactivates p53 . EP400 targets MDM2 and CK1 α , activators of MDM4 . As an effect , high levels of MDM4 , which binds the p53 tumor suppressor protein and inhibits its activity , are detected ( Figure 6 ) [ 137 ] . 5 . 3 . NOTCH Genes In MCCs , mutations also occur in the NOTCH family , which can function as either oncogenic or suppressor genes , depending on the type of cell . Both NOTCH1 signaling , which takes part in cell fate determination , proliferation , differentiation , and apoptosis , and NOTCH2 signaling , which is responsible for the determination of the cell destiny in the embryo as well as for regulation of the immune system and tissue repair , are particularly affected in MCCs . A total of 75 % of MCPyV - MCCs demonstrate NOTCH alterations , where NOTCH1 mutations are identiﬁed in 50 – 96 % of MCCs cases [ 138 ] . The majority of mutations contain a typical UV signature . NOTCH mutations are mostly identiﬁed within EGF and ankyrin repeat regions , which conﬁrms the inactivating nature of these mutations . Loss - of - function mutations occurring in MCPyV - MCCs indicate their suppressive role in MCCs and other neuroendocrine malignancies [ 9 , 13 , 14 ] . It was shown that the expression of NOTCH3 is an independent predictor of MCC outcome [ 139 ] . 5 . 4 . Hedgehog Signaling Pathway The hedgehog ( HH ) signaling pathway regulates growth in embryos as well as en - ables maintenance of the stem / progenitor cell population and control of hair follicle and sebaceous gland development . HH signaling also controls cell proliferation by upreg - ulation of MYCN , cyclin D , and E , as well as forkhead box protein M1 ( FOXM1 ) [ 140 ] . It is activated by HH ligands including Sonic HH , Indian HH , and Desert HH as well as by alternative cascades triggered by V - Ki - Ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog ( KRAS ) , transforming growth factor - beta 1 ( TGF - β ) , phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) , AKT serine / threonine kinase ( protein kinase B , PKB ) , and protein kinase C alpha ( PKC - α ) that stimulate glioma - associated oncogene ( GLI ) zinc ﬁnger transcription factor ( TF ) [ 141 ] . In the conventional pathway , HH ligand binds to trans - membrane receptors—protein patched homolog 1 ( PTCH1 ) and protein patched homolog 2 ( PTCH2 ) , which sustain PTCH - SMO ( Smoothened , Frizzled Family Receptor ) inhibi - tion . SMO transmembrane G protein - coupled receptor releases GLI proteins ( GLI1 / 2 / 3 ) from their repressor—cytoplasmic suppressor of fused homolog 9 ( SUFU ) protein [ 142 ] . GLI TFs transmit the signal to the nucleus , and depending on its type ( GLI1—activation , GLI2 / 3—activation or suppression ) , they regulate transcription of target genes , including cell cycle regulators such as E2F , D - type cyclins , Cyclin A2 , CDK1 , and Cyclin B1 , as well as proto - oncogene int - 1 homolog ( WNT ) , TGF - β , forkhead transcription factor ( FOXE1 ) , zinc ﬁnger protein SNAI1 , PTCH1 , and itself— GLI1 . GLI1 creates a positive feedback loop , whereas PTCH1 , PTCH2 , and hedgehog interacting protein ( HIP ) act as negative regula - tors [ 140 , 143 – 147 ] . Hedgehog pathway - related genes are upregulated in the majority of MCCs cases . Altered expression was observed in Sonic HH ( 93 % ) , PTCH ( 86 % ) , GLI3 ( 86 % ) , Indian HH ( 84 % ) , SMO ( 79 % ) , GLI1 , and GLI2 ( 79 % ) genes . Moreover , higher expression of Sonic HH was identiﬁed in virus - positive MCCs in comparison with virus - negative ones . Increased expression of Sonic HH , Indian HH , PTCH , and GLI1 was signiﬁcantly correlated with a better patient prognosis [ 148 , 149 ] . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 16 of 39 5 . 5 . PI3K – AKT – mTOR Pathway The PI3K – AKT – mTOR pathway is known to be overactivated in MCCs . Phosphatidyli - nositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) , whose p110 α subunit is encoded by the PIK3CA gene , takes part in cell movement , growth , and proliferation as well as migration and translation of new proteins . Moreover , it phosphorylates signaling molecules that transmit signals from the cytoplasm to the cell nucleus and is involved in the regulation of insulin and maturation of fat cells . Thus , the PI3K / AKT pathway is essential for cell survival . PTEN acts as a negative regulator of PI3K and is a tumor suppressor , preventing the cell from growing and dividing uncontrollably . Allelic loss at 10q23 is associated with loss of the PTEN gene . Gain - of - function mutations in AKT1 , HRAS , and KRAS have also been reported . Moreover , activating mutations occur in phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate dependent Rac exchange factor 2 ( PREX2 ) , which is an inhibitor of PTEN [ 9 , 13 , 14 , 150 ] . 5 . 6 . Chromatin Modifying Genes BMI - 1 is a subunit of the polycomb repressor complex 1 ( PRC1 ) , which performs chromatin remodeling by histone 2A monoubiquitylation and its further methylation . It plays an important role in the regulation of morphogenesis in embryonic development and hematopoiesis during pre - and postnatal life , controlling the cell cycle as well as the DNA damage response [ 151 ] . BMI - 1 expression is altered in 78 % of MCCs [ 152 ] . Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 ( EZH2 ) is a member of the polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) . This complex methylates lysine 27 of histone H3 , causing inhibition of gene transcription and heterochromatin formation [ 153 ] . In 54 % of MCC , EZH2 is overexpressed and results in downregulation of tumor suppressor genes , thus contributing to tumor progression . Higher expression of EZH2 is associated with a poorer MCC patient’s prognosis [ 154 , 155 ] . Lysine methyltransferase 2D ( KMT2D ) and lysine methyltransferase 2C ( KMT2C ) encode mixed - lineage leukemia 2 ( MLL2 ) and mixed - lineage leukemia 3 ( MLL3 ) , respectively . Both KMT2D and KMT2C are tumor suppressors and are downregulated in MCC . Moreover , KMT2D was demonstrated to be involved in MCPyV integration , which leads to the inactivation of this tumor suppressor in MCPyV + MCC [ 14 , 46 ] . Additionally , sex combs like transcriptional regulator 1 ( ASXL1 ) , a member of polycomb group proteins , take part in the deubiquitylation of mono - ubiquitylated lysine 119 on histone H2A . ASXL1 is a tumor - suppressor gene , so its lower expression in MCC results in inhibition of cell - protective INK4B - ARF - INK4A signaling , especially production of p53 , and as a consequence of tumor progression [ 14 , 156 ] . 5 . 7 . Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors Vascular endothelial growth factors ( VEGFs ) are endothelial cell - speciﬁc mitogens that are responsible for angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis . Enhanced expression of intratumoral VEGFA , which promotes angiogenesis within the MCC environment , results in higher risk of metastases and is associated with poorer recurrence - free and overall sur - vival [ 157 – 159 ] . VEGFA upregulation is suggested to be driven by MCPyV oncoproteins in virus - positive MCCs due to its signiﬁcantly higher level than in MCPyV - MCCs . VEGFA is overexpressed in 91 – 95 % of MCC cases [ 152 , 160 ] . Additionally , VEGFC is also upregulated in 75 % of MCCs [ 152 ] . Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor - 2 ( VEGFR - 2 ) expression in MCC correlates with tumor size as well as metastatic potential . VEGFR - 2 is upregulated in 91 % of large ( > 2cm ) MCCs and in 70 % of small size ( < 2 cm ) MCCs [ 161 ] . 5 . 8 . Tyrosine Kinase Receptors KIT proto - oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase , which is a transmembrane receptor for stem cell factor ( SCF ) and is known to enhance the progression of human tumors [ 162 ] . KIT is expressed in 42 . 5 – 67 % of MCCs , while its ligand is detected approxi - mately in 8 . 6 – 31 % of them . Co - expression of KIT and SCF is identiﬁed only in 16 % of MCC cases . Four KIT point mutations were detected where two silent mutations were within ex - ons 16 and 18 and two more were located in intron 16 - 17 . KIT overexpression is associated Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 17 of 39 with higher risk of progression and metastases . Platelet - derived growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFRA ) is a surface tyrosine kinase receptor for the PDGF family . PDGFRA is responsible for wound healing , organ development , and tumor development , including MCCs . PDGFRA and PDGFA are overexpressed in 31 . 9 – 87 % and 81 % of MCCs , respectively . Co - expression of these molecules was detected in 81 % of all MCC cases . Approximately 12 . 5 % of MCC patients have common PDGFRA exon 10 S478P substitution [ 163 – 165 ] . Anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) is also a receptor tyrosine kinase , occurring within many types of human tumors . ALK signaling exhibits anti - apoptotic function and also promotes proliferation , differentiation , and migration . ALT upregulation is observed in 51 % of MCCs [ 154 , 166 , 167 ] . 5 . 9 . BCL - 2 Family The BCL - 2 family is responsible for the regulation of apoptosis . BCL - 2 itself is a pro - survival protein , such as BCL - XL and myeloid cell leukemia - 1 ( MCL - 1 ) . The ratio of anti - apoptotic and pro - apoptotic proteins determines whether a cell will survive or die [ 168 ] . BCL - 2 is considered a proto - oncogene , mainly due to its pro - survival effect . As normal Merkel cells , 80 – 85 % of MCC cells also express BCL - 2 constitutively . There were no differences in MCPyV DNA between BCL - 2 positive and negative MCC . BCL - 2 negative tumors are more likely to metastasize and have lower overall survival compared to BCL - 2 positive MCCs [ 169 , 170 ] . Anti - BCL - 2 therapy alone was considered insufﬁcient . Glaucarubin - induced DNA damage results in apoptosis of MCPyV + MCC , promoting its regression . Thus , the combination of BCL - 2 inhibition and DNA damage - induced apoptosis constitutes a future treatment strategy for virus - positive MCCs [ 171 ] . MCL - 1 sequesters pro - apoptotic BAK / BAX proteins , resulting in inhibition of apoptosis . It is altered in approximately 88 % of MCC patients . MCL - 1 targeting therapy may be a promising tumor treatment [ 152 , 172 ] . 5 . 10 . Toll - Like Receptors Toll - like receptors ( TLRs ) play a signiﬁcant role in the ﬁrst line of the immune system . They are expressed in all innate immune cells and in cells of other tissues . TLRs recognize either exogenous or endogenous danger signs , pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) , and damage - associated molecular patterns ( DAMPs ) , respectively . PAMPs are known to be microbial molecular structures , including pathogen - speciﬁc proteins , lipoteichoic acid , peptidoglycan from Gram - positive bacteria , and lipopolysaccharide of the Gram - negative bacteria outer membrane as well as RNA of viruses and DNA from viruses and bacteria . DAMPs are products of host cell injury or non - physiological death , such as extracellular matrix and plasma membrane components , cytosolic and nuclear proteins , and damaged elements of organelles [ 173 ] . TLRs altered expression is considered to reﬂect a clinicopathological hallmark as well as to be a prognostic marker of MCC . Downregulation of TLR9 , which identiﬁes unmethylated CpG DNA motifs , is signiﬁcantly associated with virus - positive MCC . Nuclear expression of both TLR2 , which is a receptor , e . g . , for peptidoglycan and lipoarabinomannan , and TLR5 , a receptor for ﬂagellin , correlates with large tumor size , while higher cytoplasmic TLR2 expression is observed within smaller tumors . Older age contributes to upregulation of nuclear TLR4 , a lipopolysaccharide receptor , as well as decreased expression of TLR7 , which is a single - stranded RNA receptor [ 173 , 174 ] . 5 . 11 . Chromosomal Abnormalities The presence of chromosomal abnormalities is correlated with a larger size of MCC and increased risk of metastases . They are more frequently observed within virus - negative than virus - positive MCCs . The median number of extensive genetic aberrations was 5 . 5 ± 1 . 1 changes per tumor . The majority of alterations are gains of chromosome arms as well as whole chromosomes [ 175 ] . Ampliﬁcations were observed on the following chromosomes : 1 ( 37 – 63 % ) , 3q ( 33 % ) , 5p ( 32 – 38 % ) , 6p ( 42 % ) , 8q ( 38 % ) , 19 ( 63 % ) , and X ( 41 % ) , while losses Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 18 of 39 are detected on 3p ( 46 % ) , 4q ( 16 % ) , 5q ( 21 – 26 % ) , 7q ( 37 , 5 % ) , 8p ( 21 % ) , 10 ( 33 % ) , 11q ( 17 % ) , 13q ( 21 – 33 % ) , 16q ( 11 % ) , and 17p ( 25 % ) . 13q14 – 21 and 13q12 – 12 deletion is associated with loss of the RB1 and BRCA2 gene , and the gain of 1p34 is correlated with overexpression of the MYCL gene [ 14 , 175 – 179 ] . 5 . 12 . MicroRNAs miRNA proﬁle varies between virus - positive and virus - negative MCCs . The ex - pression proﬁle of miR - 203 , miR - 30a - 3p , miR - 769 - 5p , miR - 34a , miR - 30a - 5p , and miR - 375 signiﬁcantly differs between those two types of MCC . Based on miRNA expression , MCCs could be divided into three groups , suggesting their heterogeneity , whereas MCPyV - MCCs are more diverse than MCPyV + tumors . miR - 203 , which suppresses cell growth and in - hibits proliferation by targeting oncogenic molecules , is overexpressed in MCPyV - MCCs , while it is expressed at a lower level in MCPyV + MCCs . Thus , miR - 203 is thought to promote regression of virus - negative MCC . Additionally , an increased level of miR - 105 is considered to correlate with MCC metastases [ 177 , 180 ] . 5 . 13 . Other Genes Loss - of - function mutations occur in NF1 , which inhibits cell growth and turns off the RAS protein ( which has an adverse , stimulating effect ) as well as in PRUNE2 , which is a proapoptotic factor . PRUNE2 is suppressed in 62 . 5 % of MCC cases [ 13 ] . The GRIN2A gene , which encodes a protein that forms a subunit of NMDA receptors , and BRCA2 , which is involved in repairing damaged DNA , are downregulated in MCCs . The ex - pression of the TSC1 gene is also decreased [ 9 , 13 ] . Overexpression of matrix metal - loproteinases ( MMP ) , such as MMP7 and MMP10 / 2 , is signiﬁcantly associated with metastatic MCC ( mMCC ) [ 158 ] . The p16 ( INK4A ) and p14 ( ARF ) proteins are encoded by the cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor 2A ( CDKN2A ) gene located at the short arm of chromosome 9 ( 9p21 . 3 ) . Both of them control the cell cycle and are involved in cell senescence . The p16 ( INK4A ) protein inhibits CDK4 and CDK6 , which normally take part in cell cycle progression . p14 ( ARF ) prevents p53 from being degraded . p16 ( INK4A ) is upregulated in almost every MCC ( 97 . 7 % ) to prevent uncontrollable proliferation , resulting from suppression of RB1 gene [ 166 ] . Mutations in DNA repair gene pathways , including mutL homolog 1 ( MLH1 ) , ATM , BRCA1 associated protein 1 ( BAP1 ) , checkpoint kinase 2 ( CHEK2 ) , and FA complementation group A ( FANCA ) , were observed in 29 % of MCC patients [ 13 , 181 ] . 6 . MCC Treatment 6 . 1 . General Rules for MCC Treatment and Prognosis MCC should be treated in highly specialized centers by an experienced multidisci - plinary team . Surgical treatment is the mainstay of therapy in local and loco - regional primary MCC . For local disease , excision should be done with 1 – 2 cm margins and down to the fascia or periosteum . Patients with the clinical node - positive disease should undergo com - plete lymph node dissection ( CLND ) . For clinical node - negative cases , sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) is required . In some cases , CLND should be followed by radiation ther - apy [ 182 ] . Chemotherapy is used in some cases in the perioperative setting and unresectable and metastatic disease . Adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage I – III disease does not improve overall survival . Neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy are not routinely recommended for the loco - regional disease but may be considered in some selected cases . Based on recently published clinical trial results , immunotherapy has become the mainstay of treatment of metastatic disease . Chemotherapy , which was the standard of care in mMCC in the past , is recommended in case of contraindications to immunotherapy . Participation in clinical trials remains a valuable and recommended option [ 183 ] . MCC has a high rate of local recurrence , regional lymph node metastasis , and distant metastasis . The prognosis is poor and correlates with the stage of the disease . 10 - year overall survival is about 65 % in women and 50 . 5 % in men ( 57 % on average for all patients ) . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 19 of 39 The most important prognostic factor is the size of the primary tumor . Additionally , extra - cutaneous extension is of important prognostic value . Depending on the size of the primary MCC , the 10 - year survival rate is 61 % for tumors with up to 2 cm and 39 % for tumors above 2 cm [ 184 ] . For patients with loco - regional disease ( stage IIIB ) , the 5 - year survival rate is 37 % , and for patients with mMMC , it is 16 % [ 185 ] . Lymph node involvement is also associated with poorer prognosis , with worsening of prognosis with increasing nodal involvement . Additionally , non - surgical treatment of the primary tumor is associated with worse outcomes , and positive or narrow surgical margins , lymphovascular invasion , and location in the head or neck are associated with poorer prognosis [ 182 , 186 , 187 ] . Comor - bidities like HIV , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , solid organ transplant , and chronic T - cell immunosuppression are also known risk factors [ 182 ] . 6 . 2 . MCC Staging The appropriate MCC management requires proper staging . MCC staging is per - formed according to the 8th edition of AJCC classiﬁcation ( American Joint Commission on Cancer ) . This system is based on the analysis of prognostic factors from 9387 MCC cases in the US [ 188 – 190 ] . 6 . 3 . Treatment of MCC Stage I – II The goal of surgical treatment is complete surgical excision with clear surgical margins . Surgical margins have to be balanced with the morbidity of the surgery . The current guidelines include wide ( to a margin of at least 1 – 2 cm ) deﬁnitive scar excision . In some cases , when tissue sparing is necessary , Mohs micrographic surgery and modiﬁed Mohs surgery or other methods may be considered . If radiation therapy is planned , narrow surgical margins are likely sufﬁcient . In the absence of detectable metastases to regional lymph nodes , a sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) is recommended . The sentinel lymph node metastases occur in 25 – 35 % of patients with no clinically detected metastases . The risk of micrometastases increases signiﬁcantly in patients with a primary focus greater than 1 cm in diameter [ 182 , 191 , 192 ] . For patients with local or loco - regional disease who are not candidates for surgical treatment or refuse surgery , treatment including deﬁnitive radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy may be an acceptable option . 6 . 4 . Treatment of MCC Stage III In cases of the presence of metastases to regional lymph nodes ( both micro - and macrometastases ; stage III , Figure 7 ) , complete lymph node dissection ( CLND ) is indicated . Adjuvant radiotherapy to the bed after lymph node dissection may improve treatment outcomes [ 193 ] . In some selected cases , perioperative systemic chemotherapy may be considered , but data about the efﬁcacy of this approach are limited . No survival beneﬁt has been reported in retrospective studies [ 194 – 196 ] . Even though the preliminary results of the trials with immunotherapy in the neoadju - vant setting are promising , this systemic treatment should not be used outside of clinical trials . The activity of nivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting has been shown in the Check - Mate 358 study ( NCT02488759 ) . In this phase I / II clinical trial , thirty - nine patients with stage IA - IV MCC received nivolumab in a dose of 240 mg intravenously on days 1 and 15 . The surgery was planned for day 29 . The responses were assessed by imaging and pathology examinations . The surgery was done on thirty - six patients . Three patients were not operated on , one due to disease progression and two due to toxicity . A total of 47 . 2 % of patients ( n = 17 ) who underwent surgery achieved the pathological complete re - sponse ( pCR ) . In 54 . 5 % of thirty - three operated patients evaluable for radiological response ( n = 18 ) , tumor reductions of at least 30 % were reported . Responses were not dependent on the status of TMB , PD - L1 , and MCPyV . Tumor recurrence was not observed in patients with pCR . The median follow - up was 20 . 3 months . The median recurrence - free survival ( RFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) were not achieved . There was a signiﬁcant correlation between RFS and pCR and radiological response at the time of surgery . Any grade treatment - related Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 20 of 39 adverse events ( TRAE ) were reported in 46 . 2 % of patients ( n = 18 ) , and TRAEs G3 / G4 were observed in 7 . 7 % of patients ( n = 3 ) . In this group of patients , no unexpected toxic effects were reported [ 197 ] . Figure 7 . Locally advanced , unresectable MCC with in - transit metastases ( stage III ) in immunocom - promised patient ( patient with CLL , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ) . 6 . 5 . Radiotherapy MCC is considered a radiosensitive tumor . Adjuvant radiotherapy in MCC could eliminate micrometastases and occult disease . However , there is a lack of evidence coming from randomized controlled trials . In a large retrospective analysis of 6908 patients with MCC , adjuvant radiotherapy signiﬁcantly improved overall survival in patients without lymph node metastases ( stage I and II ) in comparison to non - irradiated patients [ 198 ] . Nevertheless , the same analysis showed that adjuvant radiotherapy did not improve the survival of patients with stage III disease . Other retrospective studies conﬁrmed the beneﬁt of adjuvant radiotherapy for local control and survival [ 193 , 199 – 201 ] . Thus , adjuvant radio - therapy should be considered in the majority of patients with stage I - III MCC after surgery , especially those with a primary tumor larger than 2 cm , inadequate surgical margins , lymphovascular space invasion , primary site in head and neck , or immunodeﬁciency [ 182 ] . There are no clear recommendations regarding target volumes , but in the vast majority of reports and protocols , elective margins are extensive , achieving 5 cm added to the primary tumor bed volume [ 182 , 202 , 203 ] . Moreover , it is recommended to consider encompassing the draining lymph node stations localized within 20 cm of the primary tumor [ 195 , 196 ] . The decision of elective lymph node irradiation should be based on nodal status . Adju - vant radiotherapy may be omitted in the case of negative SLNB in anatomical areas that are not at risk of false - negative results or after lymphadenectomy in the case of a single macroscopic clinically detected lymph node without extracapsular extension . The clear indications for nodal irradiation are clinically evident lymphadenopathy or positive SNLB Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 21 of 39 without lymphadenectomy and multiple lymph node metastases and / or extracapsular extension after lymphadenectomy . Due to the high radiosensitivity of MCC , deﬁnitive radiotherapy or radiochemother - apy may be offered to the patients who are not suitable for surgery or refuse operation ( Figure 8 ) . There is no evidence regarding the routine use of radiochemotherapy both in the adjuvant and deﬁnitive settings . There are no clinical trials on the recommended fractionation regimens in MCC . The proposed total doses in 2 Gy fractions were proposed by NCCN ( Table 1 ) [ 182 ] . Table 1 . Total doses in 2 Gy fractions recommended by National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines in various clinical situations . Setting Indication DoseRange Adjuvant Negative resection margins , high - risk 50 – 56 Gy Microscopically positive resection margins 56 – 60 Gy Macroscopically positive resection margins 60 – 66 Gy Positive sentinel lymph node biopsy with no evidence of clinically palpable or radiologically suspicious for nodal metastases without lymphadenectomy 50 – 56 Gy Multiple involved lymph nodes and / or extracapsular extension after lymphadenectomy 56 – 60 Gy Deﬁnitive Unresectable or refused surgery or at high risk of postsurgical morbidity 60 – 66 Gy Clinically palpable or radiologically evident nodal metastases without lymphadenectomy 60 – 66 Gy Int .

Follow - Up after Deﬁnitive Treatment Follow - up after loco - regional treatment in patients with MCC should include a com - plete physical examination , including skin and imaging examinations for distant metastases ( especially for high - risk patients ) , and these should be done every 3 – 6 months for the ﬁrst 3 years [ 182 ] . 6 . 7 . Treatment of Local and Disseminated Recurrences Published meta - analyses and retrospective analyses have shown that the prognosis in case of disease recurrence is poor . Local relapses are the most common and happen in about 30 % of patients treated surgically . Postoperative radiation therapy reduces this percentage to approximately 11 % [ 204 ] . Local recurrences can be treated as a primary MCC and should be individualized . If possible , tumor lesions should be excised with clear surgical margins , with adjuvant radiotherapy , if not used previously . Systemic chemotherapy may also be considered . For disseminated recurrences ( Figures 9 and 10 ) , systemic therapy recommended for mMCC should be used [ 182 ] . Figure 9 . Extensive MCC skin lesions in patient with disease disseminated to skin and lungs ( stage IV ) . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 24 of 39 Figure 10 . MCC spreading to the skin of the chest and abdomen ( stage IV ) . 6 . 8 . Treatment of MCC Stage IV 6 . 8 . 1 . Chemotherapy Historically based on similarities to small cell carcinoma , regimens of platinum and etoposide or cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , and vincristine are most commonly used for ﬁrst - line chemotherapy in MCC . Cyclophosphamide with doxorubicin or epirubicin and with vincristine combination was the most commonly used chemotherapy regimen with an overall response rate of 75 . 7 % ( 35 . 1 % complete , 35 . 1 % partial , and 5 . 4 % minor responses ) . Etoposide wth cisplatin or carboplatin was the next most commonly used regimen with an overall response rate of 60 % ( 36 % complete and 24 % partial responses ) [ 205 ] . In general , chemoregimens combining carboplatin , cisplatin , and etoposide , cyclophosphamide with vincristine , doxorubicin , prednisone , bleomycin , or 5 - ﬂuorouracil have been used in MCC treatment [ 206 ] . Most commonly cisplatin 25 mg / m 2 / day × 3 days ( days 1 to 3 ) with etoposide 100 mg / m 2 / day × 3 days ( days 1 to 3 ) is used . The high RR is not followed by durable responses in MCC . Tumors often recur / progress within 4 – 15 months [ 183 ] . A retrospective study of 6908 patients found that chemotherapy is not associated with an overall survival beneﬁt in patients who presented with either local or nodal MCC [ 198 , 207 ] . In speciﬁc settings , chemotherapy is used . In a ﬁrst - line setting , RR range from 53 % to 61 % with a median PFS of 3 . 1 months and duration of response < 8 months . In a second - line - setting , RR rates range from 23 % to 45 % with a median PFS of 2 months and duration of response < 8 months . In a later - lines setting , RR range from 10 % to 29 % with no complete responses and median duration of response < 2 months and median PFS of 2 – 3 months and OS of 4 – 5 months [ 5 , 208 ] . 6 . 8 . 2 . Immunotherapy One of the most recent and rapidly developing treatment options for all cancers , in - cluding MCC , is immunotherapy . Clinical studies with immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated the clinical activity of anti - PDL1 / anti - PDL1 antibodies in MCC . Additionally , durable responses have been shown . Due to the high activity of anti - PD - 1 and anti - PD - L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of metastatic MCC , conﬁrmed in phase II clinical trials , the current guidelines recommend immunotherapy as the treatment of Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 25 of 39 choice for metastatic MCC . Additionally , pembrolizumab may be considered for recurrent regional disease [ 182 ] . In 2017 , the FDA approved avelumab to treat adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC ) irrespective of prior therapy , and EMA approved avelumab as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma . These approvals were based on data from an open - label , single - arm , multicenter clinical trial JAVELIN Merkel 200 ( NCT02155647 ) . This study consisted of part A , which included patients treated in the second line ( n = 88 ) , and part B for systemic treatment - naive patients ( n = 116 ) . The ﬁrst data from part A of this study , published in 2016 , resulted in the approval of this drug for MCC therapy [ 209 ] . The patients eligible for part A of the JAVELIN Merkel 200 study were adult patients , in good performance status ( ECOG 0 - 1 , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 - 1 ) , with mMCC conﬁrmed by histology , disease progression following at least one previous sys - temic therapy used in the metastatic setting , measurable disease according to RECIST v . 1 . 1 criteria ( Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ) , and adequate bone marrow , renal , and hepatic function . The participants received avelumab at a dose of 10 mg / kg of body weight intravenously every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . The primary end - point was conﬁrmed objective response ( CR or PR ) based on independent assessment and RECIST 1 . 1 criteria . Efﬁcacy and safety populations included patients who received at least one dose of the study drug . The ORR was 31 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : 21 . 9 – 43 . 1 % ; n = 28 ) , with CR in eight patients and PR in twenty patients . Stable disease ( SD ) was observed in nine patients . The responses were long - lasting and , at the time of analysis , were maintained in 23 patients . The duration of response ( DOR ) was at least 6 months in 92 % of cases . The mPFS was 2 . 7 months ( 95 % CI : 1 . 4 – 6 . 9 ) , and the rate of PFS at 6 months was 40 % . The PFS curve reached a plateau . The mOS was 11 . 3 months ( 95 % CI : 7 . 5 – 14 . 0 ) , and the OS rate at 6 months was 69 % . In this analysis , ﬁve grade 3 treatment - related adverse events were reported in four ( 5 % ) patients : lymphopenia in two patients , aminotransferase increase in one patient , creatine phosphokinase increase in one patient , and blood cholesterol increase in one patient . No treatment - related Grade 4 AEs or treatment - related deaths were reported . In 74 patients , PD - L1 expression was assessed ( ≥ 1 % positive cells ) , and it was present in 58 cases . The test for MCPyV was done in 77 cases and was positive in 60 % ( n = 46 ) . Better outcomes were reported in patients who received fewer prior lines of systemic therapy [ 209 ] . The results from the ﬁrst analysis were conﬁrmed by the updated analyses with a median follow - up of 18 months and 24 months published in 2018 . The patients were followed up for 29 . 2 months ( 24 . 8 – 38 . 1 ) . The mOS was 12 . 6 months ( 95 % CI : 7 . 5 – 17 . 1 ) , and the 2 - year survival rate was 36 % . The median treatment duration was 3 . 9 months ( 0 . 5 – 36 . 3 ) . The conﬁrmed ORR was 33 . 0 % ( 95 % CI : 23 . 3 – 43 . 8 ) . The median DOR was not reached ( 2 . 8 – 31 . 8 ) . The PFS values were 29 % after 12 , 29 % after 18 , and 26 % after 24 months of follow - up . Clinical activity was observed irrespectively of PD - L1 expression status and MCPyV status [ 210 , 211 ] . The results of the next updated analysis published in 2020 also conﬁrmed the efﬁcacy of avelumab in the group of previ - ously pretreated patients . The ORR was 33 . 0 % ( 95 % CI : 23 . 3 – 43 . 8 % ) . CR was observed in 10 patients ( 11 . 4 % ) . In 17 of 29 patients who achieved response to treatment ( 58 . 6 % ) , the response was maintained . Four patients had a continuous response lasting at least 3 years . DOR was 40 . 5 months ( median ; 95 % CI : 18 . 0 months—not estimable ) . PFS rate at 2 years and 3 years was 26 % ( 95 % CI : 17 – 36 % ) and 21 % ( 95 % CI : 12 – 32 % ) , respectively . After ≥ 44 months of follow - up , OS was 12 . 6 months ( median ; 95 % CI : 7 . 5 – 17 . 1 months ) . OS rate at 3 years and 3 . 5 years were 32 % ( 95 % CI : 23 – 42 % ) and 31 % ( 95 % CI : 22 – 41 % ) , respectively . High tumor mutational burden and high expression of MHC I ( major histo - compatibility complex class I ) were associated with trends in the improvement of OS and ORR . Long - term responses , i . e . , responses for at least 3 years , were observed regardless of PD - L1 expression . Any grade AEs and Grade ≥ 3 AEs were reported in 97 . 7 % and 73 . 9 % , respectively . Any grade TRAEs and TRAES G ≥ 3 occurred in 77 . 3 % and 11 . 4 % of participants , respectively . The most frequently reported TRAEs were fatigue , diarrhea , and Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6305 26 of 39 nausea . Immune - related adverse events ( irAE ) were reported in nineteen patients ( 21 . 6 % ) . Four irAE were Grade ≥ 3 : increased transaminases , increased alanine aminotransferase , autoimmune disorder , and hypothyroidism . Eight patients ( 9 . 1 % ) discontinued therapy due to TRAEs . There were no deaths related to the study treatment [ 212 ] . The preliminary results of part B of JAVELIN Merkel 200 with avelumab in the ﬁrst - line treatment of patients with mMCC were published in 2017 . In 16 patients , after a follow - up period of at least 3 months , the unconﬁrmed response rate was 68 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : 41 . 3 – 89 . 0 ) . Safety was assessed in 29 patients . TRAEs Grade ≥ 3 were reported in ﬁve patients ( 17 . 2 % ) . They included two cases of infusion - related reaction , one case of aspartate aminotransferase increase , one case of alanine aminotransferase increase , one case of cholangitis , and one case of paraneoplastic syndrome . They were the reason for treatment discontinuation [ 213 ] . The extrapolated survival data were published in 2018 . The mean survival rate was 49 . 9 months ( 6 . 3 ; 179 . 4 ) , and 1 - year and 5 - year survival rates were 66 % and 23 % , respectively [ 214 ] . The updated results conﬁrmed that 77 . 8 % ( 14 out of 18 ) of treatment responses were maintained . The response duration in 83 % of cases was longer than 6 months ( 95 % CI : 46 – 96 % ) [ 215 ] . The next updated analysis , with a median follow - up of 21 . 2 months ( range , 14 . 9 – 36 . 6 ) , was published in 2019 ( n = 116 ) . The median treatment duration was 5 . 5 months ( range , 0 . 5 – 35 . 4 ) . Treatment was continued in 26 patients ( 22 . 4 % ) at the data cut - off . The ORR was 39 . 7 % ( 95 % CI : 30 . 7 – 49 . 2 % ) , with CR in 19 patients ( 16 . 4 % ) and PR in 27 participants ( 23 . 3 % ) . In PD - L1 + patients ( n = 21 ) , ORR was 61 . 9 % ( 95 % CI : 38 . 4 – 81 . 9 % ) , and in the PD - L1 - participants ( n = 87 ) , the ORR was 33 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 23 . 6 – 44 . 3 % ) . Median DOR was 18 . 2 months ( 95 % CI : 11 . 3 months—not estimable ) . A response that lasted at least 6 months was seen in 35 patients . PFS rate at 6 months and at 12 months was 41 % ( 95 % CI : 32 – 50 % ) and 31 % ( 95 % CI : 23 – 40 % ) , respectively . Median OS was 20 . 3 months ( 95 % CI : 12 . 4 months—not evaluable ) . The OS rate at 1 year was 60 % ( 95 % CI : 50 – 68 % ) , and in PD - L1 + and PD - L1 groups , 1 year OS rates were 71 % ( 95 % CI : 47 – 86 % ) and 56 % ( 95 % CI : 45 – 66 % ) , respectively . Any grade TRAEs occurred in 94 patients ( 81 . 0 % ) . Grade ≥ 3 TRAEs were reported in 21 participants ( 18 . 1 % ) . No treatment - related deaths were reported [ 216 ] . The efﬁcacy of avelumab in the real world was assessed in the expanded access pro - gram , which included mMCC patients with disease progression during or after chemother - apy and patients ineligible for chemotherapy or clinical trial participation . The efﬁcacy and safety results were consistent with those from the JAVELIN Merkel 200 clinical trial ( Table 2 ) . The enrolled population also included patients who had an ECOG PS 2 or 3 , had brain metastases stable after therapy , or were potentially immunocompromised . The me - dian duration of avelumab treatment was 7 . 9 months ( range , 1 . 0 – 41 . 7 ) . A total of 240 out of 494 enrolled patients were evaluable for efﬁcacy . The ORR was 46 . 7 % in the evaluable patients , and 22 . 9 % and 23 . 8 % of participants achieved CR and PR . The safety data are limited . The most frequently reported AEs were an infusion - related reaction , fever , fatigue , rash , asthenia , abdominal pain , chills , and dyspnea [ 217 ] . Pembrolizumab , another immune checkpoint inhibitor , anti - PD1 monoclonal antibody , was approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of patients with recurrent locally ad - vanced or metastatic MCC , based on KEYNOTE - 017 study results ( NCT02267603 ) . The pri - mary end - point was ORR in the ﬁrst - line setting . Fifty patients with MCC stage IIIB – IVC were enrolled in this study . The median follow - up was 14 . 9 months ( range 0 . 4 – 36 . 4 months ) . The ORR was 56 % ( 95 % CI : 41 . 3 – 70 . 0 % ) , with complete responses in 24 % and partial re - sponses in 32 % of participants . Among the 28 patients with responses , a response duration of more than 6 months and 12 months was observed in 96 % and 54 % of participants , respectively . The median PFS was 16 . 8 months , and the PFS ratio after 2 years was 48 . 3 % . The median OS was not reached , and the OS rate after 2 years was 68 . 7 % . The presence of polyomavirus did not correlate with ORR , PFS , or OS . The ORR in MCPyV ( + ) and MCPyV ( - ) patients was 59 % and 53 % , respectively . In patients with PD - L1 expression , some trends for better PFS and OS were observed . Grade 1 or 2 treatment - related adverse events were reported in 68 % of participants ( n = 34 ) .

One treatment - related death was reported in this study [ 218 , 219 ] . The safety and efﬁcacy of nivolumab have been assessed in advanced MCC in a group of 25 patients in CheckMate 358 study ( Table 2 ) . The ORR rate in patients evaluable for response ( n = 22 ) was 68 % after the 26 - week follow - up ( range 5 – 35 weeks ) , 71 % ( n = 14 ) in treatment - naïve participants , and 65 % in pretreated patients ( n = 8 ) [ 220 ] .

The Resistance to the Available Systemic Therapies MCC resistance , either primary or secondary , to chemotherapy and checkpoint in - hibitors remains a major clinical challenge ( Figure 11 ) . The data regarding effective therapy for patients whose disease is refractory to PD - 1 pathway blockade are missing . The pub - lished case studies and case series describe patients treated with additional immune check - point inhibitors after MCC progression during anti - PD - 1 therapy . LoPiccolo et al . [ 116 ] reported objective responses in four of thirteen ( 31 % ) patients treated with anti - CTLA - 4 , alone or in combination with anti - PD - 1 . There are currently many clinical trials conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of new therapies in MCC . Figure 11 .

Conclusions Merkel cell carcinoma is an uncommon and highly aggressive skin cancer develop - ing within the dermis and subcutis with an immunophenotype corresponding to sensory Merkel cells of the skin—mechanoreceptor cells of the basal layer of the epidermis . Histori - cally , advanced MCC patients have a poor prognosis , with less than 20 % alive at ﬁve years . MCC is transiently sensitive to chemotherapy , including platinum agents and etoposide ( EP chemo regimen ) , with reported ﬁrst - line response rates ( RR ) between 53 % to 61 % . In March 2017 , the ﬁrst approval of immunotherapy , avelumab—an anti - PD - L1 checkpoint inhibitor—has increased the PFS of MCC patients . In the avelumab trial , 74 % of responses were longer than one year ( median duration not reached ) . Thanks to the development of next - generation sequencing ( NGS ) , the mutational proﬁle of MCC was recently described in detail . It was shown that the pathogenesis of MCC is variable with MCPyV integrated within the genome detected in 60 – 80 % of cases . The mutational tumor burden of Merkel cell carcinoma varies signiﬁcantly between virus - negative and virus - positive MCCs . Viral negative MCCs are characterized by the UV damage signature—involving C to T transi - tions at dipyrimidine bases ( i . e . , CC to TT ) . In particular , mutations occur in RB1 , TP53 , and NOTCH genes as well as in the PI3K – AKT – mTOR and HH pathways . The PI3K – AKT – mTOR pathway is often hyperactivated in MCCs , and p16 ( INK4A ) is upregulated in almost every MCC . Viral - negative tumors show low to non - expression of RB protein deriving from RB1 copy number loss and loss - of - function of the gene . Similarly , pathogenic mutations in the TP53 gene and deregulation of p53 protein expression are also detected mostly in viral - negative tumors . The presence of chromosomal abnormalities is correlated with a larger size of MCC and an increased risk of metastases . They are more frequently observed within virus - negative than virus - positive MCCs . Genome - wide copy number analysis has conﬁrmed recurrent large regions of chromosomal gain and loss . Similarly , the expression proﬁle of miR - 203 , miR - 30a - 3p , miR - 769 - 5p , miR - 34a , miR - 30a - 5p , and miR - 375 signiﬁcantly differs between those two types of MCC . Recent data on the molecular biology of MCC enable the identiﬁcation of new potential therapeutic targets . Currently , multiple clinical trials investigating novel drugs , including immunotherapy , are ongoing . MCC patients should be treated by an experienced multidisciplinary team .
