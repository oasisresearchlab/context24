Both designers and entrepreneurs create opportunities for innovation in products , services , processes , and business models . More specifically , both design thinking and entrepreneurship education encourage individuals to look at the world with fresh eyes , create hypotheses to explain their surroundings and desired futures , and adopt cognitive acts to reduce the psychological uncertainty associated with ambiguous situations . In this article , we illustrate how we train students to apply four well - established cognitive acts from the design cognition research paradigm—framing , analogical reasoning , abductive reasoning , and mental simulation—to opportunity creation . Our pedagogical approach is based on scholarship in design cognition that emphasizes creating preferred situations from existing ones rather than applying a defined set of tools from management scholarship . In doing so , we provide avenues for further development of entrepreneurship education , particularly the integration of design cognition .

INTRODUCTION As universities around the world have incorporated entrepreneurship education ( Oxford , 2013 ) , scholars and entrepreneurs alike have grown increasingly skeptical of the usefulness of traditional teaching methods , which rely on business plans , case studies , and guest speakers ( Gartner & Vesper , 1994 ; O ' Connor , 2013 ; Vesper & Gartner , 1997 ; Williams Middleton & Donnellon , 2014 ) . After all , entrepreneurs ( Busenitz & Barney , 1997 ; Dyer , Gregersen , & Christensen , 2008 ; Sarasvathy , 2001 ) think very differently from managers and the rest of the population . The ill - defined nature of entrepreneurial problems contradicts students’ expectations of well - defined processes aimed at reaching a single answer with significant guidance from instructors ( Austen , 2012 ) . In response , many business schools , and even entrepreneurial programs , are adopting design thinking techniques and tools . To strengthen students’ understanding of these design thinking tools , we claim that teachers should emphasize their cognitive underpinnings . A lucid comment from one of our students about customer journey maps supports our assertion . The student commented that “due to the complex and personal nature of decision - making , it is not always possible to map an experience as a set of linear , cause - and - effect steps . Doing so results in only a partial understanding of the journey , with no consideration of the user’s context and past experiences . ” At the end of the course , he offered the following reflection . “By supplementing these tools with additional cognitive activities , such as framing and abductive reasoning , we gain a deeper appreciation of not only what the user is feeling , but why they are feeling that way . Ultimately , this allows us to comprehend the root cause of the user’s frustrations , but also leads to a broader understanding of the problem . It is this broader Page 4 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 3 understanding at a higher level of abstraction that leads to genuine and impacting innovation . ” 1 This article extends recent contributions to entrepreneurship scholarship ( Glen , Suciu , & Baughn , 2014 ; Van Burg & Romme , 2014 ) to explicate how design thinking , defined as the cognition , processes , and tools designers use to imagine a desired future , informs the process and skills needed to spot and develop opportunities ( Garbuio & Lovallo , 2015 ) . Specifically , we respond to Glen et al . ’s ( 2014 ) call to incorporate design thinking in entrepreneurship education in a way that complements , rather than replaces , the analytical tools and teaching styles of most business schools . To do this , we expand on a stream of design thinking scholarship ( Johansson - Sköldberg , Woodilla , & Çetinkaya , 2013 ) that advocates consideration of the cognition that underlies design thinking methods . Analytical reasoning , the typical mode of reasoning taught in business schools , equips students with cognitive skills and technical methods to deal with varying degrees of uncertainty ; however , there is a gap in management education when it comes to addressing complex , ill - defined problems with scarce or ambiguous facts and unclear means - end relationships ( Schön , 1983 ) . Design cognition addresses these gaps by identifying specific cognitive acts and structures associated with productive outcomes to open - ended and unstructured situations . Four recent and convergent developments support the need for a more nuanced understanding of the contribution of design cognition to entrepreneurship education : ( 1 ) opportunity creation as a cognitive skill , ( 2 ) the fact that opportunities are created rather than discovered , ( 3 ) the popularity of lean start - up approaches ( which further exemplifies the practical resolution of the debate between opportunity discovery and creation ) , and ( 4 ) design thinking as a cognitive rather than process - based construct . 1 Massimo Garbuio thanks Rob Dongas for this reflection .

Design cognition scholarship provides a well - researched and teachable set of cognitive acts , including convergent and divergent thinking , framing , analogical reasoning , pattern recognition , counterfactual thinking , mental simulation , and abductive reasoning ( Baron , 2004 ; Cornelissen & Clarke , 2010 ; Gaglio , 2004 ; Grégoire , Cornelissen , Dimov , & Burg , 2015 ; Mitchell et al . , 2002 ) . Yet many instructors do not know how these processes contribute to opportunity creation and how to effectively introduce students to these acts . Second , the longstanding debate over whether opportunities are discovered or created ( Alvarez & Barney , 2010 ) has been resolved , in practice rather than theory , by budding entrepreneurs’ preference for methods that are compatible with creation rather than discovery . Specifically , older scholarship in entrepreneurship has explored how exogenous shocks to preexisting industries form opportunities , which unusually alert individuals or firms discover ( Kirzner , 1989 ; Shane , 2003 ) . Newer approaches instead lean toward the assumption that entrepreneurs themselves form opportunities endogenously through an enactment process ( Aldrich & Ruef , 2006 ; Shane & Venkataraman , 2003 ) . The difference has profound pedagogical implications . In the discovery approach , opportunities can be identified through typical tools of strategic analysis , such as evaluating threats and opportunities in the environment ( Porter , 1980 ) . The central features of the creation approach are a willingness to experiment and an ability to learn from experimentation ( Alvarez & Barney , 2010 ) . This learning requires creativity , mental flexibility , the ability to be open to conflicting feedback , and a willingness to fail and learn from experience . In contrast , the discovery approach draws Page 6 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 5 on the techniques for strategic analysis for pedagogy ; those teaching creation opportunities are inspired more by creative design and art ( Baker & Nelson , 2005 ; Sarasvathy , 2001 ) Third , the increasing pace and dynamism of business environments , in which entrepreneurs pitch their ideas , suggest that an extensive business plan is often not feasible . The lean start - up approaches taught as part of accelerators and incubators provide incentives for students to pitch both raw and well - formed ideas , refine them , and iterate until a commercially viable concept emerges . Accelerators , incubators , and online programs offer both brief and long courses on developing opportunities and business models , often filling the gap left by conventional entrepreneurship courses . For entrepreneurs , the frameworks and concepts of the lean start - up ( Ries , 2011 ) , the business model canvas ( Osterwalder & Pigneur , 2010 ) , the long - term value of customers , and the cost of acquiring a customer are far more commonly used than the strategic analysis tools introduced in early entrepreneurship education . Both lean start - up and the business model canvas approach refer to design thinking tools and processes , though they shy away from explicitly teaching the cognitive acts that facilitate the development of new opportunities . Finally , as entrepreneurial scholarship has emphasized the cognitive aspects of opportunity creation , so has design thinking ( in design studies scholarship ) emerged as a cognitive rather than procedural construct ( Visser , 2006 , 2009 ) . Teaching cognition rather than process has also emerged as a fundamental pedagogical perspective ( Eastman , 1999 ; Oxman , 2004 ) in which the cognitive acts rather than the process of design comprise the explicit teaching content . Similarly , in a meta - analysis of creativity training , cognitive strategies have indeed been found to play a critical role in enhancing individuals’ creative skills ( Scott , Leritz , & Mumford , 2004 ) . The role of the educator is to challenge students with questions that lead them to think differently about problems ( Gómez Puente , van Eijck , & Jochems , 2013a ; Gómez Puente , van Eijck , & Jochems , 2013b ) . Over the years , and across Page 7 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 6 disciplines , as design thinking has evolved into different meanings , its foundations often have been taken for granted ( Johansson - Sköldberg et al . , 2013 ) . A fundamental distinction can be made between the evolution of design thinking in the design discourse and in the management discourse . Some time ago , the research focus of design discourse shifted toward the discovery of cognitive skills , reflective practice , and the creation of meanings , among other aspects . Meanwhile , the latter has become popular through a narrower interest on ( 1 ) how designers work ( Brown , 2008 , 2009 ; Kelley , 2007 ) , relying heavily on IDEO’s way of working with innovation ; ( 2 ) a way to approach organizational problems from a practical perspective ( Dunne & Martin , 2006 ; Liedtka & Ogilvie , 2011 ; Martin , 2009 ) ; and ( 3 ) management theory , which views design thinking as an organizational resource leading to innovation ( Collopy & Boland , 2004 ) . In this article , we adhere to design thinking rooted in the cognitive design discourse , which recommends that designers and educators nurture a set of cognitive skills rather than processes and tools . In the cognitive design research paradigm , design practice emanates from a set of cognitive acts and forms of knowledge representations associated with the parallel feat of creating a new object , service , or system and the way this new creation works ( Dorst , 2011 ) . The cognitive acts presented here are based on empirical research spanning over 60 years ( Cross , 2007 ) , which confirms that the choice of cognitive acts and the forms of knowledge representations determine the productivity of the designer and the quality of the solution . With this in mind , we are able to provide a clearer contribution to entrepreneurial education by building on the most current design discourse . Next , we review current approaches to entrepreneurial education , expand on key emerging trends and show how design thinking and design cognition have reached both scholarship and practice . Then we briefly expose the four cognitive acts at the basis of design and entrepreneurial cognition and follow with a framework for a design - driven Page 8 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 7 entrepreneurship education . We conclude with a discussion of applications of this approach and some final remarks . 2 . ENTREPRENEURIAL EDUCATION : A ROAD PAVED BY DESIGN COGNITION Over the years , entrepreneurship education has evolved dramatically in part due to influences from other fields .

Over time , it became apparent that entrepreneurs themselves can create opportunities through an endogenous enactment process . Some examples include : the contingency planning approach , which emphasizes divergent thinking , a perspective that train entrepreneurs to better recognize opportunities through a process that unfolds over time ; opportunities - centered learning , which focuses on exploration and development of opportunities through case studies ; and , effectual entrepreneurship , which encourages entrepreneurs to develop goals based on personal strengths and available resources . Entrepreneurship scholars and practitioners increasingly call for design thinking concepts and design methodologies to assist with entrepreneurship teaching and new venture creation more broadly ( see , e . g . , Glen et al . , 2014 ; Van Burg & Romme , 2014 ) . Design thinking has been identified as an efficient way of dealing with highly uncertain situations and uncovering unanticipated problems early ( Fixson & Rao , 2014 ; Fixson & Read , 2012 ) . In the practice of entrepreneurship education , the lean start - up approach and the business model canvas practice both build on the management discourse of design thinking . Page 9 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 8 The lean start - up approach ( Blank , 2013 ; Ries , 2011 ) incorporates aspects of the management discourse of design thinking . Stemming from quality improvement and engineering , lean methodology encourages entrepreneurs to focus on experimenting and getting feedback from potential customers for the next development iteration rather than following a rigid business plan . A lean start - up creates a “minimal viable product , ” a product with the minimum features customers need so that it can be “pivoted” or changed along the way based upon feedback . Like the management discourse , it encourages iteration , but its focus on developing a functioning commercial prototype means that it devotes less time to broadly and deeply characterizing the problem and ideating on solutions , as design thinking emphasizes . It also assumes that the firm should validate hypotheses about product and feature desirability with users in the marketplace . This methodology has been widely adopted , especially by incubators and government agencies such as the U . S . National Science Foundation in its Innovation Corps program . 2 Although the business model canvas approach is not derived from design thinking and involves setting up a different problem ( i . e . , the business model itself ) , it shares several characteristics with design thinking : a focus on identifying users’ needs , a cross - disciplinary view of the “business model” and its underlying value proposition ( the product or service “design” ) , and significant collaborative work for ideating new business models . Accordingly , the business model canvas approach resembles design thinking’s phases as described in the management discourse of design thinking , and some of its tools , such as empathy maps and persona profiles ( Johansson - Sköldberg et al . , 2013 ) . In managerial scholarship , the concept of design thinking is rather equivocal , largely because design thinking has entered the field from design practice rather than from design scholarship . The tools and processes of design thinking brought into management practice— 2 National Science Foundation ( 2013 ) .

Although the processes , techniques , and tools of design are indeed relevant to management , in design research , the object of study has turned toward the behaviors of design practitioners . Design researchers seek to explain designers’ behaviors through the causal importance of the structures and processes of cognition , such as prototyping and its psychological outcomes , rather than through their tools and methods per se ( Gerber & Carroll , 2012 ) . Hence , design cognition research focuses on identifying productive mental representations , structures , and processes for various design situations ( Goel & Pirolli , 1992 ) . Furthermore , a critical limitation of lean start - up and business model canvas and related approaches is their reliance on a structured , step - by - step process ( Liedtka & Ogilvie , 2011 ) , which may restrict their usefulness in dynamic business environments . Linearity may be an artifact of pedagogical and communication needs , but we have found , and instructors have noted , that proceeding in a fixed linear sequence can help students see where they are in the process and , more importantly , what knowledge they are gaining with a discrete stage . Yet design scholarship reveals that design as a fixed process does not work , as it may lead to design fixation , “a blind , and sometimes counterproductive adherence to a limited set of ideas in the design process” ( Jansson & Smith , 1991 , p . 4 ) . Thus , design scholars suggest that problems and solutions must co - evolve to generate the most novel yet feasible solutions ( Maher , 2000 ; Wiltschnig , Christensen , & Ball , 2013 ) . When problem formulation can be modified , there is no clear linear sequence of problem definition , enumeration of solutions , and selection of a solution . Rather , the solution emerges from one problem frame that can be modified as a result of an emergent solution , thereby yielding different solutions ( Dorst & Cross , 2001 ) . Similarly , an understanding of the Page 11 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 10 customer problem to be solved can change over time by iterating the proposed solution and its validation , whether through mental simulation ( explained later ) or physical prototypes . Hence , it is critical to master a set of cognitive acts that can be flexibly applied in various situations , rather than focus on tools and techniques that risk becoming routinized ( such as Porter’s Five Forces ) . Some educators might initially find it helpful to follow the design stages / cognitive acts in a phased manner . Notably , any process or design tool has a set of underlying cognitive acts that can be opaque to practitioners—sometimes deliberately so . 3 . THE THINKING IN DESIGN THINKING This section establishes the cognitive language of design thinking that we apply to entrepreneurship education in the next sections . Design cognition research ( Visser , 2006 , 2009 ) , as well as option generation research ( Garbuio , Lovallo , Porac , & Dong , 2015 ) , have identified four fundamental cognitive acts : framing , analogical reasoning , abductive reasoning , and mental simulation . We briefly introduce these four cognitive acts ; the references in Table 2 offer more in - depth theoretical and empirical investigations of them . A creative solution is based on the novel standpoint from which a problematic situation can be tackled , an act referred to as framing ( Dorst , 2011 ) . The cognitive act of framing ( or reframing a “stale” problem ) is widely regarded as a key creative aspect of the design process ( Cross , 2006 ; Lawson , 1997 ) . In entrepreneurship and design , every problem has a problem frame and a solution frame , which are defined through problem framing and solution framing . Analogical reasoning is the cognitive act of transferring the properties of a source domain to a target domain based on an abstract conceptualization ( mental representation ) of structured similarity between the two domains ( Holyoak & Thagard , 1995 ) . Analogical reasoning is a part of human cognition ( Hofstadter & Sander , 2013 ) , as it can occur spontaneously ( Goldschmidt , 1999 ; Hofstadter , 2001 ) .

The hypothesis may or may not be logically or empirically true . In classical logical reasoning , abductive reasoning proposes the most plausible and parsimonious explanation for observations . Dorst ( 2011 ) describes two types of abduction in design : explanatory abduction and innovative abduction . Explanatory abductions introduce hypotheses to explain surprising observations While innovative abductions introduce hypotheses about a new product , service , or system and its working principle that influence the production of the only known observation : the intended value . Mental simulation involves reassessing past events and imagining future environments before making decisions and taking action ( Sanna , 2000 ) . According to Gaglio ( 2004 ) , mental simulation is a key cognitive act of entrepreneurs as it allows emotions to be re - experienced and helps individuals anticipate physical and social environments by envisioning strategies and tactics to make accurate estimates and enable goal achievement . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Insert Table 2 about here - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 4 . APPLYING DESIGN COGNITION TO OPPORTUNITY CREATION In this section , we elaborate on a fundamental theme in entrepreneurial education ( Kickul , Janssen - Selvadurai , & Griffiths , 2012 ) for which the integration of design cognition provides the greatest value : opportunity discovery . 3 We discuss key cognitive acts from design cognition and integrate them into opportunity creation ( see Figure 1 ) . Notably , we focus on the thinking aspect of design thinking rather than on tools , techniques , and processes , as the 3 There is no doubt that business model design , scalability , and financial resources are fundamental to the success of startup companies . However , opportunity creation appears to be the most urgent area for cognition , both theoretically and from an educational point of view .

A wealth of research identifies preconditions of opportunity recognition , including prior knowledge and external conditions ( Shane , 2000 ; Shepherd & DeTienne , 2005 ) , the thought processes that transform knowledge and observations of the environment into opportunities ( Cornelissen & Clarke , 2010 ; Ucbasaran , Westhead , & Wright , 2009 ) and the impetus to act on them ( Dimov , 2007 ) . Importantly , opportunity creation comprises a large component of entrepreneurship courses and a very specific aspect of entrepreneurial education . Whereas marketing , operations , and strategy are assumed to be prerequisite knowledge for entrepreneurship courses , opportunity creation and the creation of new business models for resource - constrained startups are peculiar aspects of entrepreneurial education ( Kickul et al . , 2012 ) . While entrepreneurship education research identifies various approaches to search for problems to solve , opportunity creation has often been described as a creative process ( Lumpkin , Hills , & Shrader , 2004 ) . Overcoming the comfort of familiar situations is the key hurdle facing opportunity creation ( Berns , 2008 ) . Alvarez and Barney ( 2010 ) highlight that prior industry or market experience may actually hinder learning ( Sine , Haveman , & Tolbert , 2005 ; Weick , 1979 ) . While “natural” entrepreneurs and innovators alike constantly question the existing order ( Dyer et al . , 2008 ) , students often have difficulty looking at the world with fresh eyes to discover unmet needs . Entrepreneurial alertness , information asymmetry , prior knowledge , social networks , personality traits , and type of opportunity all influence the process of Page 14 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 13 opportunity creation ( Ardichvili et al . , 2003 ) . Studies in entrepreneurial cognition have highlighted that opportunity emerges from pattern recognition ( Baron , 2006 ; Baron & Ensley , 2006 ) , similarity judgments ( Grégoire , Barr , & Shepherd , 2010 ) , and associational thinking ( Dyer et al . , 2008 ) . Gielnik and coauthors ( 2012 ; 2014 ) investigate the role of divergent thinking , or the general ability to identify multiple original ideas ( Guilford , 1950 ) , in opportunity recognition . They postulate that divergent thinking is the end product of more specific cognitive acts , such as conceptual combination , analogical reasoning , and abstraction ( Mumford , 2003 ; Ward , 2007 ; Welling , 2007 ) . However , from a pedagogical ( and experimental ) perspective , there is reason to examine these processes separately , as we have done . During opportunity identification , we help students use all four cognitive acts to define and elaborate on ambiguous problems and identify new opportunities ( see Figure 2 for examples of usage ) . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Insert Figure 2 about here - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 4 . 1 . 1 . Framing in opportunity creation Framing aims to establish alternative ways of interpreting situations in accordance with different perspectives on various dimensions . These may be achieved by observing situations involving user behavior , user - or designer - generated problem statements , and even solution concepts and their underlying principles ( used to induce backwards the “problems solved” ) . Specifying when and where framing occurs allows the designer to name and clarify the bounds of problem and solution spaces and provides a systematic way of expanding those spaces . The most common act of framing is to help students see different types of users and stakeholders as individuals rather than as “average users . ” For example , when working on a credit card project , it is important to interview not only card users and their families , but also Page 15 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 14 call - center staff , employees in shops where the cards will be used , and even those who cannot afford to use credit cards . In general , the range of problem frames encountered will depend on the sample of users and the manner of data collection . An in - class reframing exercise that we find effective is inspired by the reframing approach of the Austin Center for Design . In this exercise , Center instructors use a toothbrush as the object of design and ask students to consider three new scenarios . First , they ask them to reframe the toothbrush as it would be used in an atypical environment ( e . g . , in the kitchen , in an airplane , at a conference ) . Second , they ask the students to reframe the toothbrush from a different perspective ( e . g . , for use by a dentist , a hotel housekeeper , a blind date ) . Third , they ask the students to reframe the toothbrush as a different type of object ; what if it were a plant , a spray , or a service ? The new frames help students observe unmet customer values , which become novel problems to address . There are several ways we can induce framing and reframing . Abstraction is a means of stepping back and reconsidering problems more generally or through opposites . Based on design creativity , abstraction involves prompting students with abstract variations of statements of their current design problem or solution formulation to help them think creatively about problem or solution ( Chiu & Shu , 2008 ; de Vries , Jessurun , Segers , & Achten , 2005 ; Linsey , Markman , & Wood , 2012 ) . Abstract variations use words that subsume a concept , such as is - a ( e . g . , a dog is a pet ) and has - a ( e . g . , a dog has a companion ) relationships . For example , we prompt students who imagine a start - up aiming to challenge the insurance industry to think in terms of pricing risks rather than selling insurance policies . We could reframe the opportunity in terms of a more abstract concept , pricing intangible value , because risk is an intangible value . In the classroom , we have implemented abstraction in the spirit , if not the form , of experiential learning ( Amador , Miles , & Peters , 2006 ; Duch , Groh , & Allen , 2001 ; Kolb , Page 16 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 15 1984 ) . Rather than teaching this framing technique to students directly , we let them explore different ways of looking at a situation by organizing a simulated experimental session in class . After organizing the class into two groups , we ask one group to redesign an object ( e . g . , the classroom ) and the other to redesign a concept ( e . g . , how we educate people ) . When we move toward the solution stage , the second group systematically provides many and more interesting solutions because it had a larger problem space . Some of these solutions might not be feasible , but this is not important during the opportunity - identification stage . Directing students to think in opposites and extremes can help them frame situations in novel ways to reveal new dimensions and perspectives . Thinking in opposites is a common method of creative thinking ( Rothenberg , 1973 ) . For example , when students are looking for opportunities for a new insurance startup , instead of having them focus on innovative ways to “price risk” ( the fundamental activity of an insurance company ) , we ask them to “price love . ” This challenge sparks ideas they would not have discovered if the focus had been on the insurance business itself . They may then apply analogical reasoning , as they wonder how they can adopt principles from companies that price love ( e . g . , De Beers ) to the situation at hand . 4 . 1 . 2 . Abduction in opportunity creation Abductive reasoning is a cognitive act in which we invent a hypothesis to explain observations that are often surprising . Importantly , these hypotheses may or may not be logically or scientifically true . If the hypotheses were already known to be true , there would not be much scope for entrepreneurial action since revenue generation models would be well established . Getting students to recognize that they are involved in abductive reasoning is important , as it helps alleviate the bias of prior knowledge or known reasons . The two types of abductive reasoning are useful in two different circumstances : when we are inferring reasons for an observation ( e . g . , a user behavior ) and when we infer an idea that a user will respond to in certain ways . Explanatory abduction , is a form of reasoning in Page 17 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 16 which individuals hypothesize novel explanations to empirical observations . The aim is to avoid pattern - recognition bias by explaining observations through recourse to alternative relationships between causes and effects . This is the typical instance in which we ask students to explicitly search for surprising facts and observations that show some value to users and then find a cause - effect relationship that explains them . The second , innovative abduction , is a form of reasoning in which we hypothesize about what to create ( i . e . , product , service , or system ) and its working principle to arrive at an aspired value ( the only “known” ) ( Dorst , 2011 ) . The hypothesis explains the causal reasons for the existence of the value ; that is , if the hypothesis turns out to be empirically true , then the value exists . In this case , the challenge is not only to understand what needs to be true to support the observation or what new value to create for the user , but also to come up with a new rule that makes the new value come alive , such as the need to create a new business model ( for more details , see Dong , Garbuio , and Lovallo ( 2016a , 2016b ) ) . In facilitating prospective and actual entrepreneurs in our classes to construct abductive hypotheses , we have observed two characteristics . First , the process helps prospective entrepreneurs better qualify and quantify the market need and value of their proposed offering , as it grounds their assumptions in actual behaviors and observations rather than in secondary research on markets and segments . Second , we find that prospective entrepreneurs generate opportunities to satisfy needs that go beyond the offering they originally had in mind . For instance , during the study of a user experience at the movies , students originally hypothesized that the user who was going to the movies regularly was looking for “a convenient offer” . A more robust ethnography ( e . g . , observations of filmgoers ) , open - ended interviewing , and a lecturer’s recollection of seeing Japanese businessmen dressed in suits watching movies in the middle of the day identified the surprising observation that many filmgoers did not search for a movie to watch – they simply went into the theater . Page 18 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 17 The students hypothesized instead that moviegoers were looking for “an escape - life opportunity . Overall , to help students in their journey , we stress the importance of observations that students find surprising ( given their knowledge ) , workarounds that users employ , and contradictions ( e . g . , between what the user says and her behavior ) . These points are often sufficient to help students create hypotheses to explain their observations of ( possibly true reasons for ) customers’ behaviors and , in so doing , to help them break free of existing preconceptions , such as “believed sources of problems . ” 4 . 1 . 3 . Analogical reasoning in opportunity creation New opportunities can emerge from making novel associations between existing things ( Bar , 2009 ) and learning from others’ success and mistakes . Analogical reasoning hence assists in increasing opportunity creation and productivity . Analogies have figured prominently as inspirations for architectural design , wherein a building is designed to “look like” a natural object , but also to exert a framework over subsequent sequences of problem formulation , interpretation , and solution assessment ( Rowe , 1982 ) . In design cognition , analogies are used in problem formulation ( Visser , 1996 ) , problem solving ( i . e . , ideation of solutions and “inspiration” ( Goel , 1997 ; Holyoak & Thagard , 1996 ; Rowe , 1982 ) ) , and uncertainty resolution to explain whether proposed solutions could work ( Ball & Christensen , 2009 ) . Scholars have identified two types of analogies : within - domain ( close field ) and between - domain ( far field ) analogies ( Vosniadou & Ortony , 1989 ) . Between - domain analogies typically are used in problem formulation ( in our case , primarily in opportunity creation ) ; within - domain analogies are primarily used in uncertainty resolution ; and solution - oriented analogies are a mixture of within - and between - domain analogies ( Christensen & Schunn , 2009 ) . Page 19 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 18 At the most basic level , working with analogies forces students to explore the source of the analogy ( the exemplar ) and its structural characteristics , and to transfer these solution principles to the case at hand ( Blanchette & Dunbar , 2000 ) . Instead of letting students use the exemplar at a very basic level ( e . g . , we should be the Uber of our industry ) , we ask them to identify key characteristics of the exemplar ( e . g . , the matching mechanisms , the entry strategy ) and examine the extent to which these characteristics can be transferred to the target domain . An intriguing application of analogical reasoning lies in thinking about a new product , service or business model using the analogs and antilogs technique . As Mullins and Komisar ( 2009 ) discuss , business ideas do not have to be revolutionary ; rather , entrepreneurs can develop them by looking at analogs—what has worked in the past—and imitating or building on these exemplars . Ideas can also be developed by looking at antilogs—businesses that have been unsuccessful—and avoiding past mistakes ( Mullins & Komisar , 2009 ) . We use the example of Apple’s iPod to explain analogs and antilogs . In a reverse - engineering exercise , we could say that the Sony Walkman is the analog that inspired Apple . Because the Walkman proved that millions of people were willing to pay for a device that allow them to listen to music on the go , Apple did not need to create or validate this hypothesis . 4 Apple also could have developed valuable insights by looking at antilogs , such as Napster , to develop a legitimate platform for downloading music : the iTunes store . The popularity of Napster as a peer - to - peer music - sharing site signified a growing trend toward downloading music . After piracy and illegal downloading led to Napster’s ultimate failure , Apple created an online store where people could download and save music after paying a small fee to avoid such legal issues . 4 Note how this hypothesis was confirmed . Prior to this confirmation , it was an abductive hypothesis . In this case , we used analogical reasoning to confirm a hypothesis . In fact , the invention of the Walkman itself also depended on the abductive hypothesis and analogy that people would enjoy personalized music on the go , just as they enjoy other personalized experiences on the go , such as reading newspapers or talking .

Mental simulation in opportunity creation Mental simulation is proposed as a key cognitive act for opportunity creation ( Gaglio , 2004 ) , especially once a proposal for a new product , service or business model has been devised . Mental simulation helps the transition from a newly identified opportunity to a better one , allowing for predictions of the outcomes of its possible implementation , even in the absence of data or previous experience . Unlike traditional means of prototyping , which only focus on a single user’s perspective , mental simulation illustrates the broad class of simulative experiences necessary to operate a competitive business . Once students have identified a new opportunity , we ask them to mental simulate in two areas . First , we focus on how to make the opportunity work in the marketplace from a business model perspective . Next , we ask them to simulate the scaling of the business , such as expanding into new occasions of consumption and new geographies . Third , we ask students to mentally simulate competitors’ reactions . We ask them to go beyond identifying which competitors and competing technologies are capable of thwarting the new venture to stress - test the opportunity . This last step can be supported by traditional business model and strategy frameworks ( Hambrick & Frederickson , 2001 ; Porter , 1980 ) . More specifically , we encourage students to consider the following questions : Are these customer needs scalable to other customer segments ? How will competitors react ? How will we defend our position ? Who are we displacing in the value chain ? Do we have the capabilities needed to produce the new offering ? Which capabilities are we missing ? Do we need partners ? Will we create value for them ? In sum , mental simulation help them identify deficiencies and contradictions within the structure of the solution and fundamentally improve it ( Dörner , 1999 ) . 5 . A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT In this section , we illustrate how we use the cognitive acts to help students identify new opportunities , whether products , services , or business models . Figure 3 summarizes our Page 21 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 20 eight - step approach to better understanding opportunity creation , which we describe in detail below . Notably , educators do not have to follow this process step by step , just as their students won’t as they identify extraordinary opportunities . However , this process should help them get a flavor for the cognitive acts that are in play . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Insert Figure 2 about here - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - At the very start , we ask the students to identify the problem they are trying to solve—e . g . , from a user perspective—and any solution that is already available or that they have in mind ( typically , a very rough idea of what the new product or service will look like ) . For the first step , we question students to help them reframe the problem from a different user perspective or by describe the problem more abstractly . For example , we might reframe the problem of reducing street violence by reframing it as the problem of how to help young people have fun in their free time . This allows us to view the problem broadly and solve different kinds of problems . An example from a different industry or even a different biological system ( analogical reasoning ) can also be useful . We might ask , how would nature solve this problem ? Bio - mimicry and biological analogies are fairly common sources of inspiration for new frames in architecture and design ( Benyus , 1997 ; Mazzoleni , 2013 ) . Second , we ask students to create ( innovative abductive ) hypothesis for a new offering . When students are stuck , we prompt them to think about different user needs , different types of users , and completely new services and occasions of consumption . The innovative abduction will help generate a new problem frame and solution frame . Third , we ask them to state the new frames , which will be the focus of the rest of the thought process . Generally , the new frames tend to be broader than the initial ones , allowing for greater opportunities for innovation as they target larger , new , or emerging markets . Page 22 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 21 Fourth , we ask students to consider how to make an opportunity work in practice . At this stage , the solution concept might still be very hypothetical ( Is it technically feasible ? Financially viable ? ) . It is often useful to find an analogy and transfer the principles from one existing , proven solution to the case at hand . Typical prompts might include : “What would you do if you were Uber ? What would you do if you were eBay ? ” Such questions help students think about a problem more abstractly ( for example , as a platform business or a platform - based marketplace ) . Design by analogy is a powerful technique , as numerous products and architectural forms have been designed through being based on analogies with nature or forms in other domains . In architecture for instance , one of the most well - known is the Sydney Opera House , whose roofs mimics sails ( Dorst , 2015 ) . In business , the common business model of a razor and blades mimics Gillette’s original sales proposition . The fifth step is to create an explanatory ( abductive ) hypothesis to explain the existence of the new product and a hypothesis that would negate the existence of the new product . Typical questions we use to encourage explanatory abduction include , “Is there a market for this problem if we use this kind of solution ? Can it work ? ” Sixth , we ask students to state the new opportunity in terms of “value that is delivered to the customers” as well as the business models that emerged from the previous two steps . Seventh , since the opportunity might still have several uncertainties ( e . g . , Is there a market ? How big is it ? How urgent is the need for a solution ? What will competitors do ? ) , we use mental simulation to prune off ideas that might be interesting but not currently feasible , such as a lack of capabilities or available customers . Once these non - ideal solutions have been eliminated , we are left with a solution that the students feel comfortable pushing forward ( that is , we have reduced the psychological uncertainty of facing the unknown ) .

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EDUCATORS Educators of design thinking have to transition to teaching in a team - , project - , and studio - based learning environment . This section provides recommendations on introducing design cognition within a problem - and team - based pedagogy , which is the common approach to entrepreneurship education . We then discuss the environment , based on studio learning ; the role of lecturers as coaches ; external support from designers and the design community ; and the importance of students’ critical reflection as a key learning tool . 6 . 1 . Design and Project - based Education Design education is fundamentally different from managerial education , as it is more about coaching students in the discovery of problem and solution spaces than spoon - feeding them information . Students who are accustomed to more common , traditional didactic teaching methods tend to resist this new approach due to its uncertainty , messiness , and highly qualitative , real - world aspects . It is useful to keep in mind certain practices common to all project - based learning approaches . First , if a client buys into the design process and is willing to accept , a modifiable brief can be a useful starting point to transform a traditional course into a design - based one . The problem statement is often bounded by the client’s needs , which can address some of the variables that students would otherwise have to explore themselves ( e . g . , Which real problem should we solve ? What situation should we study ? ) . This “realness” comes from the client providing objective and real feedback on the usefulness and appropriateness within the actual domain for the output of each step . Of course , this is not always possible or even advisable Page 24 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 23 when the goal of the course is a full - immersion entrepreneurial journey from opportunity identification to business model design . However , when the goal is to nurture entrepreneurial mindsets in a relatively safe environment , the use of a client brief has proven to be helpful . Second , continuous assessment is necessary in project - based learning . Having milestones related to specific deliverables and “stages” of the process will help keep projects aligned and moving forward . Under the true design approach , each team may slip back or move ahead in stages , depending on its effort and returns on effort . However , teams should illustrate learning points from their project on a regular basis . Third , as project - based learning is effectively team - based learning , traditional measures used to assure effective teamwork are needed ( e . g . , team composition , leadership , and management processes ) . Much of the learning also comes from an appreciation of how teams generate different or unique solutions to the same problem . Therefore , it is important that teams share their intermediate and final outputs wherever possible . Finally , design projects are often most effective when teams are multidisciplinary . Well - known multidisciplinary programs such as Stanford’s d . school and Rotman’s DesignWorks actively seek to “seed” their teams with students from different disciplines , such as business , engineering , and design ( Fixson , 2009 ; Fixson , Greenberg , & Zacharakis , 2015a ; Fraser , 2012 ; Vogel , Cagan , & Mather , 1997 ) . An engineering or medical student will bring different perspectives on user problems and available technologies , as well as different problem - solving mindsets than those found in business schools . 6 . 2 . The Environment : Studio Learning To facilitate this work , students need space to develop their ideas , both individually and as a group . Design studios commonly used in fields such as architecture , industrial design , and art have been adopted for design thinking spaces ( Barry & Meisiek , 2015 ; Doorley & Witthoft , 2011 ) . Many design studios have artifacts as their output require physical space . Similarly , Page 25 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 24 design - driven entrepreneurship education needs a space where we can display and continually see research ( as suggested by cognitive load theory , see Lee and Anderson ( 2013 ) ) to remind students of their journey toward a final goal . The team is usually composed in a very close setting that encourages collaborative work . In the studio - learning environment , we bring the entire class together to share moments that facilitate additional cross - team learning and reflection while instructors serve as mentors , advisors , consultants , and critics ( Fixson , 2009 ) . Spaces should be reconfigurable and readily available ( Doorley & Witthoft , 2011 ) , and they should feel comfortable and relaxed . Teams working for long periods may need space to store artifacts , whiteboards , and prototypes . Physical space should be designed to support the skills and mindsets required by innovating activities ( Fixson , Seidel , & Bailey , 2015b ) and the practice of the cognitive acts . Well - known design spaces , such as those at Stanford’s d . school and Babson College’s Design Zone , have a sparse , industrial look and reconfigurable furniture that encourages participants to explore and rearrange the space as their projects and ideas evolve ( Barry & Meisiek , 2015 ; Doorley & Witthoft , 2011 ; Fixson et al . , 2015b ) . Rapid prototyping tools are increasingly a part of the setting , especially entrepreneurship spaces associated with engineering schools . 6 . 3 . The Instructors : Lecturers as Coaches As a mentor and advisor , the lecturer’s role is to help students examine a problem or solution from different angles and see each perspective’s strengths and weaknesses ( Gómez Puente et al . , 2013a ) . Students often have a hard time recognizing the purpose of “following process , ” which is not to tie them down but to strengthen and organize their thinking . An examination of the conversation in design reviews and entrepreneurship pitches found substantial differences in the thinking processes of groups taught with the traditional didactic approach and those taught with a design - driven approach ( Dong , Garbuio , & Lovallo , 2016c ) . In the Page 26 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 25 former groups , questions were aimed at killing ideas , somewhat prematurely in the design process ; in the latter , questions were asked to stimulate new hypotheses and opportunities . In our classes , we have found it is useful to clarify our position at the beginning of the semester . We highlight how we assist students in generating questions that lead them to the answers ( describing it as a sort of Socratic method for philosophy and law students ) , whether they need to bring it to the fore or search for it . We also explain that , due to the open - ended nature of the problems we are dealing with , the answers are sometimes unknown . 6 . 4 . External support : Leveraging designers in class While designers may be new to business practice , instructors can benefit from encouraging them to creatively cross - fertilize ideas , practices , and knowledge . To effectively implement the design - driven approach , we recommend that instructors look for assistance from designers who understand design cognition rather than design processes and who are able to mentor students in the co - evolution of problem and solution frames or to co - mentor with business - trained instructors in framing exercises . Students should learn the cognitive acts , which are more generalizable and useful for them in the long run than specific tools and techniques . For instructors seeking to adopt a design - driven approach to entrepreneurship education , we recommend a gradual transformation that begins with shadowing someone else , then developing one’s own materials . In the end , design is still a “practiced” art more than a science . We have found it useful to attend classes taught by designers or design - trained faculty to absorb teaching methods and to understand the subtleties of various processes and tools . Designers from traditional design professions can shed light on their creative processes and ways of thinking . But unless they have been working in a real - world domain related to what is being designed , they may not be as helpful at solving actual service - design problems . We also find that inviting designers to class to discuss their problems ( or , if serving as clients , to discuss the problems they are posing to the class ) and problem - solving approaches as “case Page 27 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 26 studies” can help introduce students to the “whys” of design thinking and its methods ( i . e . , why employ a certain technique at a certain point in time ) . Importantly , the teaching team should include not only designers but also staff from multiple fields . Indeed , the discovery of opportunities is not a single - person or single - insight attribution ( Dimov , 2007 ) , but rather the result of a process in which a set of unitary , distinct events lead to the emergence of a pattern ( Oliver & Roos , 2005 ) . Hence , we encourage a multidisciplinary approach in which design , engineering , and law students attend entrepreneurship classes with business students . 6 . 5 . The Students : Critical Reflection Fundamental to both design ( Dong , Kleinsmann , & Deken , 2013 ; Valkenburg & Dorst , 1998 ) and management ( Schön , 1983 ) , reflection helps students extrapolate learning from a situation and improve their cognitive skills . At the end of each activity ( e . g . , observation or interview ) , we ask the students to reflect in a systematic way using a learning template . We first ask them to acknowledge their previous knowledge and experiences on a similar task , then about the surprises that emerged from this new application , and ultimately how the experience is changing the way they will approach similar situations . 7 . CONCLUDING THOUGHTS 7 . 1 . Implications for Entrepreneurship Scholarship Appling design cognition to entrepreneurship education raises several potentially fruitful implications for the teaching of entrepreneurship . First , entrepreneurs’ awareness of cognitive acts enables them to apply these acts with the most appropriate tools or even to design their own tools . Importantly , whereas the processes , techniques , and tools are sometimes not transferable to other domains , cognition is . For example , applying an overly rigid user experience perspective when designing a market entry strategy for a start - up creates Page 28 of 51 Academy of Management Learning & Education 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 P e e r R e v i e w P r o o f - N o t F i n a l V e r s i o n 27 the risk of developing a myopic strategy that only satisfies customers who have been observed or interviewed as part of the opportunity discovery phase . By contrast , through the continuous act of observing and framing , entrepreneurs can recognize evolving needs and thus adapt their offerings and strategies . Another appealing aspect of the cognitive view on design thinking is that the cognitive acts demystify notions of creative insight or “genius” in both design and entrepreneurship . Instead , fluency in a relatively ordinary set of cognitive acts can support the framing of a novel problem space through distant analogical references and the formation of possible corresponding solutions . This fluency can also increase confidence ( and decrease psychological uncertainty ) that the correct problem and a set of plausible solutions have been identified through within - domain analogies and mental simulation . As such , design thinking does not arise solely from the application of a defined set of activities but rather through the application of particular ways of thinking . As we have attempted to convey , it is not possible to provide a set of tools for design , from journey mapping to prototyping , without teaching a set of cognitive acts to accompany them ( Kumar , 2012 ) . 5 The cognitive acts are at least as important as mechanical design skills , such as diagramming , sketching , and prototyping . 7 . 2 . Future Research Design - driven entrepreneurial education opens further research opportunities . First , much of our discussion has discussed how individual cognition is exercised in class settings and as a result of in - class activities . However , several studies find that opportunity discovery is not a single - person and single - insight attribution ( Dimov , 2007 ) , but rather the result of a 5 Typical tools used in design thinking include , for gathering data on customers’ experiences : customer journey mapping , empathy maps , and employment of the “five whys” ( root cause analysis ) ; for brainstorming , tools include classical group brainstorming techniques , mnemonics for helping transform knowledge such as the SCAMPER technique ; and finally , tools for prototyping include sketching , rough prototyping , storyboarding , and various service prototypes . Cognitive tools are ones that naturally rely more on the cognitive faculties , such as keen observational skills for data gathering , analogical mappings for brainstorming , and mental simulation for prototyping .

This is particularly relevant in technology entrepreneurship , which has been found to be more effective when it is built on the efforts of many ( Garud & Karnøe , 2003 ) . Van Burg and Romme ( 2014 ) suggest social aspects of entrepreneurial cognition that can be studied in conjunction with the design cognition approach . We encourage further studies that examine the application of cognitive acts to team - based learning in the context of entrepreneurial opportunity creation . Further , while we treat a problem and its solutions as separate elements in a design process , we recognize that they coexist and , often , when treated as separate activities ( e . g . , problem identification through fieldwork ) , coevolve over time ( Dorst & Cross , 2001 ) : new solutions may suggest a new presentation of the problem , and new problems may require new solutions . Qualitative and quantitative studies that investigate how problems and solutions co - evolve over time in entrepreneurial education could suggest more effective teaching methods . The approach presented in this paper is corroborated by many years of global design research and design disciplines , but is based only on our experience teaching entrepreneurship over the past seven years . Our hope is that we have begun to spread a new way of looking at design that can be effectively applied to entrepreneurship education . The lean start - up and business model canvas approaches have been widely adapted but largely untested as educational tools . In fact , although appealing from an educational perspective , these approaches might not be appropriate for complex engineered products with long lead times and high capital requirements . We hope that educators now have a greater choice of tools to experiment with in the classroom .

Key works : Schön ( 1983 ) ; Dorst ( 2011 ) ; Stumpf and McDonnell ( 2002 ) ; Cross ( 2006 ) ; Lawson ( 1997 ) In solving the problem of crime in a neighborhood , framing the problem from a policing perspective may regard the problem as one of curbing anti - social behavior , whereas framing the problem from a resident’s perspective may regard the problem as one of improving social amenities . The content of the frame makes it possible for the designer to identify salient requirements and determine the extent to which the proposed solution can satisfy them . The frame connects surveillance to curbing anti - social behavior , and parks and social clubs to improving social amenities . It is considered by some to be a key strategy in design cognition . See Dorst ( 2011 ) . Analogical reasoning (cid:1) Act of identifying and carrying over knowledge from prior situations to support the current situation . Analogical reasoning can involve within - domain ( close field ) and between - domain ( far field ) analogies . Between - domain analogies are normally used in problem formulation ; within - domain analogies are primarily used in uncertainty resolution ; and solution - oriented analogies are a mixture of within - and between - domain . Research shows that introducing between - domain design cases to prime analogical reasoning results in novel solutions when the goals of the design situation are open . Key works : Dorst ( 2011 ) ; Holyoak and Thagard ( 1995 ) ; Hofstadter and Sander ( 2013 ) ; Leclercq and Heylighen ( 2002 ) ; Christensen and Schunn ( 2007 ) ; Ball and Christensen ( 2009 ) ; Ahmed and Christensen ( 2009 ) ; Ball et al . ( 2004 ) Within - domain analogical reasoning is straightforward . Example of between - domain analogies : to identify a new opportunity for a company operating in the healthcare industry ( a heavily regulated environment that has numerous dynamic startups ) , you can study companies that operate with innovative business models in challenging environments . Alternatively , you can investigate how microorganisms have overcome challenges to survive in hostile environments . While healthcare delivery and microorganisms are indeed very different on the surface , the use of analogical reasoning forces you to focus on whether the problems might share some important characteristics .

Abductive reasoning can have either explanatory or innovative purposes . Key work : Dorst ( 2011 ) ; Kolko ( 2010 ) ; Peirce ( 1931 , 1998 ) ; Roozenburg ( 1993 ) ; Explanatory abduction creates hypotheses to explain some ( surprising ) news while working with a limited set of data to come up with the most plausible and parsimonious explanation for given observations – for instance , this happens when an entrepreneur is trying to interpret the reaction of an incumbent in the industry . Innovative abduction is employed by inventing a new product or business model . An entrepreneur must propose both a new idea ( e . g . , a new value to create for customers ) and the means for executing the new idea ( e . g . , a business model ) , with the premises ( links between the components ) that are surmised to allow it to work . Mental simulation ( mental time travel in cognitive science ) (cid:1) The act of mentally trying out the operation of an opportunity or business model to predict its outcomes in the absence of data or previous experiences . Key works : Markman , Klein , and Suhr ( 2012 ) ; Ball and Christensen ( 2009 ) ; Ball , Onarheim , and Christensen ( 2010 ) ; Heylighen and Nijs ( in - press ) ; Bilda and Gero ( 2007 ) Mental simulation is used when there is less than complete knowledge about an anticipated future into which a new design will be introduced , often entailing a large number of possibilities . The mental representation of a design solution entails the assembly , combination , and recombination of individual elements ; mental simulation is brought in to consider the effects caused by a change in any elements . Mental simulation appears to reduce the psychological uncertainties that designers face during the course of their work , such as the concern that they do not fully understand a somewhat complex design problem , the efficacy of proposed design solutions , or how end - users will interact with the product . For example , using well - established frameworks , such as the business model canvas , PESTEL , or the strategy diamond , we ask students to mentally simulate all possible scenarios and in particular how external shocks ( e . g . , changes in regulation and technology ) and competitors’ actions will affect the new venture .
