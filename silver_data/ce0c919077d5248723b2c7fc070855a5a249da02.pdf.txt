Repeated evolution of the same mutations , particularly in variants that are now rapidly spreading in various regions of the world , suggests a fitness advantage . Mutations at position P681 in Spike – possibly affecting viral transmission - have also evolved multiple times , including in two variants of concern . Here , we describe three variants circulating in New York State that have independently acquired a P681H mutation and the different trajectories they have taken . While one variant rose to high prevalence since later summer 2020 it appears to be in decline . The other two variants were more recently detected in New York and harbor additional Spike mutations that might be cause for continued monitoring . The latter two P681H variants have shown moderate increases in prevalence but ultimately all might be subject to the same fate as more competitive variants come to dominate the scene . Introduction New York State has served as a bellwether during the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic in the United States ( US ) . It was the initial epicenter of the pandemic in the US , highlighting both the effects of delayed containment efforts and successful mitigation strategies ( Rosenberg et al . 2020 ; Lasek - Nesselquist , Singh , et al . 2021 ; Maurano et al . 2020 ; Gonzalez - Reiche et al . 2020 ) . An outbreak in Westchester County led to the widespread distribution of the 20C clade , demonstrating the rapidity with which SARS - CoV - 2 could spread through a community and beyond ( Lasek - Nesselquist , Singh , et al . 2021 ; Deng et al . 2020 ; Zhang et al . 2020 ; Gonzalez - Reiche et al . 2020 ) . New York was also one of the first to identify the presence of the B . 1 . 1 . 7 variant in the US ( associated with 40 - 70 % increased growth rate ; ( Volz et al . 2021 ) and possibly 30 % increased mortality rate ; Iacobucci 2021 ) , serving as both a source and a sink for this variant of concern ( Alpert et al . 2021 ) . Recently , the number of B . 1 . 526 variants harboring Spike E484K or S477N mutations ( possibly enabling increased transmission and / or evasion of monoclonal antibodies ) were identified as rapidly growing within the state ( Annavajhala et al . 2021 ; Lasek - Nesselquist , Lapierre , et al . 2021 ; West et al . 2021 ) , underscoring the need for fortified surveillance efforts . Here we report on the trajectory of three SARS - CoV - 2 variants in New York with P681H mutations in the Spike protein . The Spike protein is required for entry into the host cell and is composed of an S1 subunit that attaches to the host cell receptor angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) , an S2 subunit necessary for fusion between virus and cell membranes , and a .

P681 is adjacent to the furin cleavage site , which facilitates efficient SARS - CoV - 2 transmission and infection ( Peacock et al . 2020 ; Hoffmann , Kleine - Weber & Pöhlmann 2020 ) . Mutations at this location ( P681H and P681R ) have been acquired by the B . 1 . 1 . 7 variant rapidly spreading around the world and the A . 23 . 1 lineage , recently reported as the dominant lineage in Uganda ( Rambaut et al . 2020 ; Bugembe et al . 2021 ) . Currently , the P681H mutation is the most commonly identified Spike mutation in SARS CoV - 2 genomes from New York State ( aside from D614G , which characterizes the B . 1 . lineage and is essentially ubiquitous in the US ) . While the majority of these genomes are members of the B . 1 . 243 lineage , we detected independently acquired P681H mutations in several lineages belonging to clades 19B , 20A , 20C , 20D , and 20G . Notably , we identified a lineage B . 1 . 1 . 222 variant ( clade 20B ) with both P681H and T478K Spike mutations and a lineage B . 1 variant ( clade 20C ) variant with Spike mutations P681H and S494P . T478 and S494 sit within the receptor binding domain ( RBD ) responsible for binding the spike protein to the ACE2 - receptor of host cells . Mutations at both positions were shown to reduce the activity of some monoclonal antibodies ( Liu et al . 2021 ; Greaney et al . 2021a ; Weisblum et al . 2020 ) . Evidence of convergent evolution as well as the structural location of P681 suggest that mutations at this position could contribute to an adaptive advantage . While the two variants described here show only moderate increases since their first appearances in New York , the combination of P681H and T478K or P681H and S494P mutations could confer additional benefits to the virus and are worthy of continued surveillance . New York is thus an experimental field , where variants endowed with differing fitness compete . It remains to be seen whether the P681H variants described here gain a foothold or succumb to more dominant forms on the rise . Results As of 2020 - 03 - 04 , over 12 % of all SARS - CoV - 2 genomes sequenced in New York carried a P681H mutation ( Figure 1 ) . After an initial peak from September to November 2020 , the proportion of genomes with this mutation remained stable until a small increase in early winter 2020 ( Figure 1 ) . The rapid spread of B . 1 . 1 . 7 , which also has a P681H mutation as well as outbreaks in congregant settings , likely contributed to the increase in later months ( Figure 1 ) . In fact , excluding B . 1 . 1 . 7 genomes from the analysis revealed a small decline in the number of P681H - containing genomes by the end of February 2021 ( Figure 1 ) . The majority of SARS - CoV - 2 genomes within New York state that carry a P681H mutation are members of the B . 1 . 243 lineage ( clade 20A ; 63 % ; Supplementary Figure 1 ) , which is detected mostly within the United States ( https : / / cov - lineages . org / lineages ) . Phylogeographic analyses indicated that B . 1 . 243 likely emerged in California mid - March 2020 ( CA 100 % CI , 2020 - 03 - 10 to 2020 - 03 - 20 ) with the P681H mutation acquired shortly thereafter ( Figure 2 ) . The B . 1 . 243 variant was probably introduced in early August 2020 to New York ( New York 100 % CI , 2020 - 07 - 20 to 2020 - 08 - 22 ; Figure 2 ) . Aside from California , New York and Hawaii have sequenced the greatest proportion of B . 1 . 243 genomes in the US and have the largest number of B . 1 . 243 genomes with a P681H mutation ( Figure 3 ) . While the B . 1 . 243 variant appears to have mostly displaced the parental form in New York , other locations with both forms do not demonstrate the same trend ( Figure 3 ) . Similarly , .

For example , California has sequenced ~ 0 . 5 % of its COVID - 19 cases , of which only 0 . 5 % of those sequenced are the B . 1 . 243 variant ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Washington sequenced ~ 2 . 5 % of all COVID - 19 cases but the percentage of B . 1 . 243 variants remained the same as that of California ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . In contrast , Hawaii has sequenced ~ 3 . 4 % of its COVID - 19 cases and 76 % are characterized as B . 1 . 243 with a P681H mutation ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Further , the proportion of B . 1 . 243 variants in New York has dramatically declined as others , such as B . 1 . 1 . 7 and B . 1 . 526 , have entered the arena ( Figure 4 ) . Thus , the foothold this variant had gained in certain locations , mainly Hawaii and New York , could reflect the effects of random processes , such as founder effects , rather than an adaptive advantage . A second variant carrying a P681H mutation has emerged within the 20B clade , lineage B . 1 . 1 . 222 , which also harbors a T478K mutation in the spike protein . Phylogeographic analyses suggest that the B . 1 . 1 . 222 variant emerged in Mexico around Mid - September 2020 ( Mexico 100 % CI , 2020 - 08 - 26 to 2020 - 09 - 29 ; Figure 2 ) with subsequent spread , including to 48 / 50 states ( the greatest proportion occurring in Texas , California , and New York ; Supplementary Table 2 ) . The B . 1 . 1 . 222 variant first appeared in New York on 2020 - 12 - 23 and now represents the majority of B . 1 . 1 . 222 genomes ( 66 % ; Table 2 ) from multiple introductions into the state ( Figure 2 ) . However , B . 1 . 1 . 222 variants have increased only ~ 2 % since December 2020 and represent a minor fraction of the circulating viral population in New York ( Table 1 and Figure 4 ) . A third variant carrying a P681H mutation evolved independently within the 20C clade , lineage B . 1 , with an inferred date of introduction into New York in early November 2020 ( NY 100 % CI 2020 - 10 - 05 to 2020 - 12 - 06 ; data not shown ) . Additionally , this variant harbors T716I and S494P mutations in the spike protein , the latter of which has been shown to reduce the efficacy of some monoclonal antibodies ( Greaney et al . 2021 ; Liu et al . 2021 ; Weisblum et al . 2020 ) . Examination of almost 6500 B . 1 genomes from the United States that were deposited in GISAID with collection dates between 2020 - 10 - 01 and 2021 - 02 - 26 revealed that only 4 . 4 % harbored both S494P and P681H mutations . Of these , 68 % derived from New York , representing the majority of cases ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . New Jersey , the state with the second highest number of B . 1 variants had only 6 % ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Since its initial detection in New York on 2020 - 12 - 01 , the number of SARS - CoV - 2 genomes with a P681H mutation attributable to this variant has risen , approaching 50 % of all SARS - CoV - 2 genomes with a P681H mutation in February 2021 ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . The proportion of SARS - CoV - 2 genomes containing P681H and S494P mutations in New York also increased by over 4 % since December 2020 ( Table 1 and Figure 4 ) . This is less than the increase demonstrated by B . 1 . 1 . 7 and both B . 1 . 526 variants but greater than B . 1 . 427 and B . 1 . 429 ( Table 1 and Figure 4 ) , which carry the L452R mutation and were identified as rapidly spreading in California ( Zhang et al . 2021 ; Tchesnokova et al . 2021 ) . In fact , if we count the B . 1 variants separately from the B . 1 lineage , they ranked 12 th in abundance in January 2021 compared to other lineages detected and 5 th in February 2021 , surpassed only by B . 1 and B . 1 . 2 , which have been circulating in New York since the early days of the pandemic ( Lasek - Nesselquist , Singh , et al . 2021 ; Maurano et al . 2020 ; Gonzalez - Reiche et al . 2020 ) , and the B . 1 . 1 . 7 and B . 1 . 526 variants . .

Within New York , B . 1 . 243 genomes with a P681H mutation represent ~ 7 % of the total number of SARS CoV - 2 genomes sequenced . This variant showed an initial spike in frequency in late summer 2020 and slowly rose in prevalence only to decrease again in recent months . Sampling biases likely do not substantially influence the decline in the B . 1 . 243 variant . While the regionally diverse sampling that occurred in September and October 2020 coincided with an uptick in COVID - 19 cases due to this variant , it was already in decline by January 2021 when more New York counties were sampled at a greater depth ( Figure 5 ) . Analyses of B . 1 . 243 in other states suggests that the rise of the B . 1 . 243 variant in New York could be due to chance rather than increased fitness . Indeed , the initial spike of cases due to B . 1 . 243 variants in October and November 2020 and a later smaller spike in December 2020 are associated with outbreaks in congregant settings , where founder effects could be responsible for rapid propagation . Alternatively , it is possible that P681H conferred a minor advantage to the B . 1 . 243 lineage , allowing it to spread more easily in congregant settings , but was outcompeted by more recently emerged , highly transmissible variants , such as B . 1 . 1 . 7 and B . 1 . 526 , and even other variants with a P681H mutation . Indeed , the dramatic decline of B . 1 . 243 variants in February 2021 coincides with the explosion of other variants in New York ( Figure 4 ) . However , we cannot rule out the effects of some sampling bias as almost all SARS - CoV - 2 genomes sequenced during this time period derived from the NYC metropolitan area ( New York City , the Mid - Hudson , and Long Island ) , which had fewer B . 1 . 243 variants in comparison to the rest of the state ( Figure 5 ) . In contrast to the recent decline in B . 1 . 243 variants , other variants with a P681H mutation carrying T478K or S494P mutations have modestly increased in frequency in New York . P681 is located five residues upstream of a multibasic site in the Spike protein , the cleavage of which facilitates processes ( such as membrane fusion ) required for viral entry into the cell ( Shang et al . 2020 ; Papa et al . 2021 ) . This mutation also occurs in B . 1 . 1 . 7 and could contribute to its increased rate of transmission ( Davies et al . 2021 ) . T478 is located in the RBD of the Spike protein , near the interface with ACE2 ( Figure 6 ) . A T478I mutation conferred moderate resistance to neutralization by two monoclonal antibodies and by convalescent serum from two patients ( Liu et al . 2021 ) . We would expect the T478K mutation to have a greater impact on neutralization , by introducing a larger residue with a positive charge at this position . The T478K mutation was identified in an in vitro evolution experiment to discover RBD mutations with increased affinity to ACE2 , but it was not characterized further ( Zahradnik et al . , 2021 ) . It is unclear why the T478K mutation would result in increased binding affinity , although it could be caused by either the change in the electrostatic potential in that region or by inducing a conformational change . S494 is located in a beta strand in the RBD , at the interface with the ACE2 receptor ( Figure 6 ) . An in vitro screen for spike mutations that escape neutralization by monoclonal antibodies and convalescent serum identified S494P ( Lui et al . , 2021 ) , which was later shown to reduce neutralization by 3 - 5 - fold in some convalescent sera ( Greaney et al . 2021b . However , this mutation was not as potent at neutralization as E484K ( Greaney et al . 2021b ) - a mutation harbored by B . 1 . 526 variants circulating in New York . .

However , we cannot rule out the effects of sampling biases , particularly for February 2021 , when almost all specimens sequenced derived from the NYC metropolitan area - the location where the majority of B . 1 . 1 . 222 and B . 1 variants were circulating ( Figure 5 ) . Considering the phenotypic characteristics conferred by the mutations present in B . 1 and B . 1 . 1 . 222 variants , their moderate increase in New York , and that convergent evolution is often indicative of positive selection , we believe both variants are worth monitoring . However , if B . 1 . 243 serves as an example , any potential selective advantage these variants have might be relatively inconsequential in the face of more transmissible or infectious forms , such as B . 1 . 526 and B . 1 . 1 . 7 . Thus , this could be a case of enhanced surveillance noting variants of interest before they became a concern . Methodology RNA extraction Respiratory swabs in viral transport medium ( VTM , UTM or MTM ) were received at the Virology Laboratory , Wadsworth Center , for SARS - CoV - 2 diagnostic testing . Total nucleic acid was extracted using either easyMAG or eMAG ( bioMerieux , Durham , NC ) , MagNA Pure 96 and Viral NA Large Volume Kit ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) , or EZ1 with the DSP Virus Kit ( QIAGEN , Hilden , Germany ) following manufacturers’ recommendations . Extracted nucleic acid was tested for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA using the 2019 - Novel Coronavirus Real - Time RT - PCR Diagnostic Panel ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) according to the Instructions for use on an ABI 7500Dx . Illumina library preparation and sequencing Library preparation and whole genome amplicon sequencing of SARS - CoV - 2 was performed using a modified ARTIC protocol ( https : / / artic . network / ncov - 2019 ) as described previously ( Lasek - Nesselquist , Lapierre , et al . 2021 ) . Bioinformatics processing Reads were processed with ARTIC nextflow pipeline ( https : / / github . com / connor - lab / ncov2019 - artic - nf / tree / illumina , last updated April 2020 ) as previously described ( Lasek - Nesselquist , Lapierre , et al . 2021 ) . Analysis of New York SARS - CoV - 2 genomes and detection of emerging variants All SARS - CoV - 2 genomes from New York were downloaded from GISAID as of 2021 - 03 - 04 or 2021 - 02 - 26 . Genomes were annotated with NextClade ( https : / / clades . nextstrain . org / ) , the results of which were inspected for changing trends in the data and further queried for mutations of interest . Pangolin lineages , geographic locations , and collection dates for genomes carrying mutations of interest were then extracted from the associated metadata provided by GISAID . Lineage frequencies were calculated on a monthly basis by dividing the number of genomes of a lineage by the total number of genomes sequenced each month . This was also performed for mutations and variants of interest . Stacked area plots and bubble maps were rendered in R v4 . 0 . 3 ( https : / / www . r - project . org / ) with ggplot2 and map packages and coloring provided by the viridis package . .

In summary , a total of 2689 genomes > 27 Kb in length were aligned in MAFFT v7 . 475 ( Katoh & Standley 2013 ) , a maximum likelihood phylogeny was generated with IQ - TREE v2 . 0 . 3 ( Nguyen et al . 2015 ) under a GTR + G4 nucleotide substitution model , and divergence times as well as ancestral traits were inferred with TreeTime ( Sagulenko et al . 2018 ) . The clock rate was fixed at 8x10 - 4 substitutions per site per year . Trees were visualized in Auspice ( Hadfield et al . 2018 ) and with the ggtree ( Yu et al . 2017 ) package for R . The timing of introduction for the B . 1 variant containing P681H and S494P mutations was estimated from a previous phylogeographic analysis ( Lasek - Nesselquist , Lapierre , et al . 2021 ) .
