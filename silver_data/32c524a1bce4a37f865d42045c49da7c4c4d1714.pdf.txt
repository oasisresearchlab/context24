As COVID - 19 infections and deaths increase in the pediatric population , characterization of SARS - CoV - 2 viral dynamics in children would enable data - driven public health guidance . Methods : Nasal swabs collected from children with COVID - 19 were analyzed . Viral load was quantified by RT - PCR ; viral culture was assessed by direct observation of cytopathic effects and semiquantitative viral titers . Correlations with age or symptom duration were analyzed . SARS - CoV - 2 whole genome amplification was compared with contemporaneous Massachusetts sequences to assess for clustering patterns . Results : Ninety - seven children with COVID - 19 ( median age 10 years , range 2 weeks - 22 years ) were included in this study . Age did not impact SARS - CoV - 2 viral load in nasal secretions : children of all ages were equally likely to carry live , replicating virus . Children within the first five days of illness had higher viral loads and rates of culture positivity , and viral load in hospitalized children ( n = 30 ) did not differ from hospitalized adults ( n = 21 ) with similar duration of symptoms . While pediatric SARS - CoV - 2 sequences were representative of those in the community , novel variants were identified . Conclusions : Children can carry high quantities of live , replicating virus , creating a potential reservoir for transmission and evolution of genetic variants . As guidance around social distancing and masking evolves following vaccine uptake in older populations , a clear understanding of SARS - CoV - 2 infection dynamics in children is critical for rational development of public health policies and vaccination strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID - 19 . .

Initially , epidemiology reports suggested that children may have been relatively spared from infection , however , as COVID - 19 testing became more available , it has been increasingly recognized that children can be infected with SARS - CoV - 2 at rates comparable to adults [ 1 , 2 ] . To date , roughly 4 million children in the Unites States have been reported as testing positive for COVID - 19 [ 3 ] . Children under 19 years of age now represent the age group with the highest rate of infection in some regions [ 4 ] . Most children generally have milder symptoms when infected with SARS - CoV - 2 [ 5 ] , although a small subset of individuals develop severe disease . In the US , over 16 , 000 children have been hospitalized for acute COVID - 19 with over 300 deaths reported [ 3 ] . A baseline understanding of infection in children is a necessary prerequisite to understanding the pathogenesis of severe presentations of COVID - 19 . At a population perspective , the role that children play in viral transmission remains poorly understood . Epidemiologic studies suggest that children exhibit lower transmission rates than adults [ 6 ] , however , these findings are potentially confounded by higher rates of asymptomatic or pauci - symptomatic infection in children , increased social isolation by children early in the pandemic , and reduced COVID - 19 testing in children . To date , one small study demonstrated that live virus can be cultured from children [ 7 ] . However , the types of systematic studies that have informed our understanding of the viral dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 in adult populations [ 8 - 10 ] have not similarly been carried out in children . As vaccination has become available for adults and adolescents many places in the world and our understanding of transmission dynamics have evolved , masking and distancing policies are being relaxed [ 11 ] . Policy changes have necessarily been made in the absence of any insight into the role that pediatric disease might play in ongoing transmission . As viral variants that enhance the potential for transmission .

Defining the virologic features of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in children and the potential for children to transmit virus will facilitate rational public health decision - making for pediatric populations . In this work , we sought to define fundamental virologic features of SARS - CoV - 2 in a pediatric population . We obtained nasal swabs from children presenting to urgent care clinics or the hospital with PCR - confirmed COVID - 19 infection . Clinical factors , such as age , COVID - 19 risk factors , and disease severity were compared with viral features including SARS - CoV - 2 viral load , isolation of replication - competent virus , and whole viral sequencing . Our data indicate that age , from infancy through adulthood , is not a predictor of viral infection dynamics , and that children of all ages can have high SARS - CoV - 2 viral loads of replication - competent virus , including variants , displaying comparable dynamics to those seen in adults . Methods Sample collection : Infants , children and adolescents < 22 years of age presenting to Massachusetts General Hospital urgent care clinics or the hospital with COVID - 19 as determined by PCR testing of nasal specimens ( 4 / 2020 - 4 / 2021 ) were offered enrollment in the Institutional Review Board - approved MGH Pediatric COVID - 19 Biorepository ( IRB # 2020P000955 ) . After informed consent , and assent when appropriate , was obtained verbally , a nasopharyngeal , oropharyngeal and / or anterior nares swab was obtained and placed in phosphate buffered saline . The samples were then aliquoted and stored at - 80 o C . Nasal samples from adults hospitalized with acute COVID - 19 ( 4 / 2020 - 8 / 2020 ; enrolled in Institutional Review Board - approved MGH COVID - 19 Biorepository , IRB # 2020P000804 ) were used for comparison of viral load . .

Trained reviewers collected demographics , SARS - CoV - 2 risk factors , comorbid conditions , medications , COVID - 19 related symptoms , and laboratory tests . Outcome of initial presentation to care , admission status , and complications of COVID - 19 disease were also extracted by manual review . SARS - CoV - 2 viral load quantification : Virions were pelleted from anterior nasal , oropharyngeal , and nasopharyngeal swab fluids by centrifugation at approximately 21 , 000 x g for 2 hours at 4°C . RNA was extracted using Trizol - LS ( Thermofisher ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . RNA was then concentrated by isopropanol precipitation and SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was quantified using the CDC N1 primers and probe [ https : / / www . cdc . gov / coronavirus / 2019 - ncov / lab / rt - pcr - panel - primer - probes . html ] as previously described [ 9 ] . Viral Culture : Vero - E6 cells ( ATCC ) were maintained in D10 + media [ Dulbeco’s modified Eagle’s media ( DMEM ) ( Corning ) supplemented with HEPES ( Corning ) , 1X Penicillin / Streptomycin ( Corning ) , 1X Glutamine ( Glutamax , ThermoFisher Scientific ) and 10 % Fetal Bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Sigma ) ] in a humidified incubator at 37C in 5 % CO2 . Vero - E6 cells were passaged every 3 - 4 days , detached using Trypsin - EDTA ( Fisher Scientific ) and seeded at 150 , 000 cells per wells in 24w plates for culture experiments and 20 , 000 cells per well in 96w plates the day before inoculation for median tissue culture infectious dose ( TCID50 ) experiments . .

The viral culture experiments were performed as previously reported [ 16 ] with the following modifications : 100uL of the solution was used to inoculate wells in a 24 well plate and 1mL of D 2 + media [ D + media with 2 % FBS ] was added to each well after 1h of incubation . The plates were then placed in a 5 % CO2 incubator at 37C . For TCID50 measurements conducted in parallel , 25uL of the Spin - X flow - through was used to inoculate Vero - E6 cells in a 96w plate in the presence of 5ug / mL of polybrene ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) using 5 - fold dilutions ( 5 - 1 to 5 - 6 ) and 4 repeats for each sample . The plates were centrifuged for 1 hour at 2 , 000 x g at 37C before being placed in a 5 % CO2 incubator at 37C . The SARS - CoV - 2 isolate USA - WA1 / 2020 strain ( BEI Resources ) was used as a positive control for CPE in both culture and TCID50 experiments . Viral culture and TCID50 plates were observed at 3 - and 6 - days post - infection with a light microscope and wells showing CPE were counted . The TCID50 titers were calculated using the Spearman - Karber method . For the culture plates , the supernatant of the wells displaying CPE was harvested 10 - 14 days post - infection and RNA was isolated using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit ( QIAGEN ) for confirmation of the viral sequence . SARS - CoV - 2 sequencing : cDNA synthesis was performed using Superscript IV reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) . Whole viral amplification was performed with the Artic protocol using multiplexed primer pools designed with Primal Scheme generating 400 - bp tiling amplicons [ 17 , 18 ] . PCR products were pooled and Illumina library construction was performed using the Nextera XT Library Prep Kit ( Illumina ) . The comparison dataset included 183 representative contemporaneous SARS - CoV - 2 genomes from .

Nucleotide sequence alignment was performed with MAFFT ( multiple alignment using fast Fourier transform ) [ 19 ] . Best - fit nucleotide substitution GTR + G + I was used for the datasets using model selection in IQ - Tree followed by maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree construction using IQ - Tree web server with 1000 - bootstrap replicates [ 20 ] . Analysis : All statistical analyses were performed using parametric comparisons in GraphPad Prism ( Version 9 . 1 . 1 ) , including Pearson correlation , ANOVA with multiple comparisons , and unpaired t test . Results Clinical cohort Ninety - seven children diagnosed with COVID - 19 with a mean age of 10 years ( range 0 - 22 years ) were included in the study ( Table 1 ) . Twenty - six children ( 27 % ) were asymptomatic but presented because of a COVID - 19 exposure or were identified on routine screening . There were more boys ( 59 % ) than girls ( 41 % ) who acquired SARS - CoV - 2 infection . One third of the participants were White ( 31 % ) , 10 % African American / Black race , and 4 % were Asian ; one third ( 37 % ) reported their ethnicity as Hispanic . Past medical history in children is reported in Supplemental Table 1 . The majority of participants did not require hospitalization ( 68 % ) ; seventeen percent required supplemental oxygen and four percent required invasive or non - invasive respiratory support . Age does not impact SARS - CoV - 2 viral load or recovery of replication competent virus To assess the relationship between age and viral load ( RNA copies / ml ) at the time of diagnosis , we performed quantitative PCR on respiratory secretions from children newly diagnosed with .

The age of each infected child was analyzed to determine whether age impacted viral load : There was no significant correlation of age with viral load ( Pearson correlation , P = 0 . 39 ) ( Figure 1A ) , nor were there significant differences between ages when grouped by school ages : 0 - 4 years ( infant through pre - school ) , 5 - 10 years ( elementary school ) , 11 - 16 years ( middle school ) , 17 and older ( high school and higher education ) ( ANOVA , P = 0 . 12 ) ( Figure 1B ) . We then compared viral loads from hospitalized children with hospitalized adults ( Adult demographics in Supplemental Table 1 ) with comparable duration of symptoms and found no differences between groups ( Figure 1C ) . Thus , a child’s age did not appear to impact viral load : all children , from 2 weeks through 22 years of age , were capable of carrying a viral load comparable to adults . As SARS - CoV - 2 RNA detection by RT - PCR does not specify whether replication - competent virus is being shed , we next sought to ascertain risk factors for shedding live virus by performing viral culture assays for recoverable SARS - CoV - 2 in parallel with viral load testing . From the 97 participants , we collected 113 samples ; live virus was cultured from 32 samples coming from 30 participants . Of note , eight of these children with cultured SARS - CoV - 2 were asymptomatic . Higher viral load was significantly predictive of shedding of live virus ( t test , P < 0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 2A ) . Consistent with the results for viral load , age was not correlated with viral culture results ; virus was recovered from children ages 1 month through 22 years ( Figure 2B ) . Semi - quantitative assessment of the amount of virus shed by an individual participant was assessed by median tissue culture infectious dose ( TCID50 ) . TCID50 for culture - positive specimens correlated strongly with viral load ( Pearson correlation r = 0 . 68 , P < 0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 2C ) but did not correlate with age across all pediatric participants ( Figure 2D ) and did not significantly differ when participants were binned by school age group ( Figure 2E ) . Children with COVID - 19 are most infectious within first five days of illness .

Consistent with prior reports in adults [ 8 ] , viral loads in children were the highest earliest in the course of illness and declined over time ( Pearson , r = - 0 . 38 , P < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 3A ) . Viral load was highest in the first two days after symptom onset , with significant decrease after 5 days of symptoms and further decline after 10 days of symptoms ( ANOVA , P < 0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 3B ) . The relationship between viral load and days of symptoms was consistent between pediatric and adult populations with no evidence of more rapid viral clearance in children ( Figure 3C ) . Analysis of pediatric viral culture results demonstrated that children tested early after symptom onset were more likely to shed replication competent virus ( P = 0 . 004 ) ( Figure 3D ) . Correspondingly , semi - quantitative assessment of infectious viral shedding in children showed that the TCID50 was higher early after symptom onset and decreased over time ( Pearson r = - 0 . 27 , P = 0 . 004 ) , with only rare positive cultures detected after the first five days of illness ( Figure 3E ) . When grouped by days of symptoms , children in days 0 - 2 of their symptoms had the highest infectivity , while children with greater than six days of illness were less infectious ( ANOVA , P = 0 . 009 ) ( Figure 3F ) . Pediatric SARS - CoV - 2 sequences are representative of those found in the community We successfully performed whole - viral sequencing of 57 respiratory samples from 54 children . Phylogenetic analysis of these pediatric sequences with contemporaneous Massachusetts sequences from GISAID showed that they are representative of the spectrum of sequences found in the community ( Figure 4 ) . Notable variants identified in the pediatric samples included four B . 1 . 1 . 7 and three B . 1 . 526 . 2 variants . To validate our culture results on a subset of culture - positive samples , we sequenced virus isolated from the supernatant from 8 positive samples . Sequences from the supernatant and respiratory specimens were identical in 7 cases and demonstrated only 1 nucleotide change in the last case . .

Because the majority of children display mild symptoms when infected with SARS - CoV - 2 , viral dynamics in children has been understudied and there is a misconception that children , especially younger children , are spared from the disease and cannot carry high level viral loads or shed transmissible virus . While it is now clear that children can become infected with SARS - CoV - 2 and develop COVID - 19 , a full understanding of the dynamics of infection in children is needed to inform public health policies specific to the pediatric population . Here , we show that pediatric patients of all ages , from infancy to young adulthood , can carry a high SARS - CoV - 2 viral load in their upper airways , particularly early in the course of infection , and an elevated viral load corresponds with high levels of viable , replicating virus . Pediatric sequences were largely reflective of those found in the general community and the presence of novel variants was identified . Our findings have significant implications for both public health policy and the potential role of universal vaccination of pediatric populations in fully curbing the COVID - 19 pandemic . As vaccination has rolled out in adult populations , public health policies are being adjusted to account for changes in risk that result from vaccination . Our results emphasize the importance of considering and clarifying how these policy changes relate to children . As adult populations have been vaccinated , pediatric cases have represented a growing proportion of infections , currently accounting for nearly 25 % of all COVID - 19 cases in the United States [ 3 ] . Our results suggest that the low rates of transmission in settings such as schools and daycares cannot be attributed to low viral loads , low rates of viral shedding , or rapid clearance of virus in younger patient populations . As changes in masking and distancing policies are implemented for adults , .

Our results additionally suggest that pediatric populations have the potential to serve as a community reservoir of actively replicating virus , with implications for both new waves of infection and the evolution of viral variants . The duration of natural and vaccine - induced immunity for each vaccine in clinical use are not yet known . If a community reservoir of actively replicating virus is maintained and transmitted within unvaccinated pediatric populations , that population could then serve as a source of new infections as vaccine - induced immunity wanes in vaccinated adult populations . In addition , viral genomic variants were readily identified in the pediatric samples and these variants have the potential to impact viral transmission [ 21 - 23 ] , disease severity [ 24 , 25 ] , and vaccine efficacy [ 26 ] . Ongoing viral replication within pediatric populations has the potential to serve as a source of existing and new viral variants that interfere with eradication efforts . Ultimately our results underline the importance of defining public health policy with viral dynamics in children in mind and of including pediatric populations in vaccine efforts aimed at eradication .
