Cytochalasin D , nocodazole , poly - L - lysine ( PLL ) were purchased from Sigma . Jasplakinolide and Latrunculin B were from Calbiochem . Oregon Green - phalloidin and Alexa Fluor594 anti - goat IgG were purchased from Molecular Probes . Live cell imaging and fluorescent speckle microscopy Speckle imaging and other live - cell imaging were carried out as described ( S3 ) . Briefly , XTC Xenopus fibroblasts were transfected with vectors using SuperFect ( Qiagen ) . Before experiments , cells were suspended in 70 % Leibovitz’s L15 medium ( Invitrogen ) without serum , and seeded into a hand - made flow cell with a PLL - coated glass coverslip ( 25 × 5 mm 2 , depth ~ 1 mm ) . After cell spreading , the flow cell was placed on the stage of an Olympus BX52 microscope equipped with 100 W mercury illumination and a cooled CCD camera ( MMX1300 - YHS , Roper Scientific ) . Time - lapse imaging was carried out at room temperature using the MetaMorph software ( Universal Imaging ) up to 120 min after cells were seeded . Fluorescent speckle microscopy was carried out by observing cells expressing a low amount of EGFP - mDia1 . A restricted area near the cell periphery was illuminated . Drug perfusion and wash - out were carried out by intermittently replacing the medium in the flow cell . Speckle velocity measurement was performed by tracking individual speckles manually with Track Points in MetaMorph software . Kymograph analysis was also performed using MetaMorph . Microinjection Recombinant RhoA - Val14 was expressed as a GST - fusion protein in E . coli , purified and cleaved from GST as described ( S1 ) . XTC cells expressing EGFP - mDia1Full were suspended as described above , and seeded onto PLL - coated round glass coverslips ( 25 mm diameter ) attached to a chamber , and allowed to spread for 30 min . The chamber was placed on the stage of an Olympus IX81 microscope equipped with a CCD camera ( MMX - 512BFT , Roper Scientific ) and unattenuated 100 W mercury illumination . Only cells expressing EGFP - mDia1Full at a low level were chosen for microinjection , and time - lapse images of EGFP were acquired at 0 . 18 - s intervals using a 100 × objective ( NA 1 . 4 ) . Then RhoA - V14 in injection buffer ( 10 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 2 mM MgCl 2 ) was microinjected into the cell at the concentration of 0 . 3 mg / ml . EGFP - mDia1Full images were intermittently acquired at 0 . 18 - s intervals 2 , 4 , 7 and 12 min after microinjection . Science Supporting Online Material Higashida , p . 2 (cid:21) Microscopic observation of actin polymerization Actin was purified from rabbit muscle according to the method of Pardee and Spudich ( S4 ) . Profilin was purified from human platelets using poly - L - proline chromatography ( S5 ) . The recombinant mDia1 ¤1(cid:22)(cid:3)ZDV(cid:3)SXULILHG(cid:3)DV(cid:3)IROORZV(cid:17) E . coli strain BL21trxB ( DE3 ) ( Novagen ) was transformed with the pGEX - 4T - mDia1 ¤1(cid:22) construct ( S1 ) , and grown overnight at 37 ° C . After subculturing into fresh media , cells were grown at 37 ° C for 3 h , and then grown for 24 h at 16 ° C with the addition of 0 . 5 mM isopropyl β - D - thiogalactopyranoside . Cells harvested by centrifugation were frozen , resuspended in buffer A ( 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , 10 % glycerol and 5 mM DTT ) containing 200 mM NaCl and a complete protease inhibitor tablet ( Roche ) , and sonicated . The sonicate was clarified at 50 , 000 g for 30 min , and mixed with glutathione - Sepharose ( Amersham Biosciences ) for 1 h at 4 ° C . Sepharose was washed three times with an excess amount of buffer A containing 500 mM NaCl . Bound proteins were then eluted with buffer B ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 5 , 50 mM KCl , 5 % glycerol , 20 mM glutachione , 1 mM DTT ) , and dialyzed against buffer C ( 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM EDTA , 50 mM KCl , 5 % Z % glycerol , 1 mM DTT ) . Purified proteins were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80 ° C . Thawed proteins were used within 2 days . Microscopy of phalloidin - labeled filaments was carried out as follows . GST - mDia1 ¤1(cid:22) ( 740 ng ) was labeled by mixing with 5 µ g GST - specific polyclonal antibody ( Amersham ) at 4 ° C for 30 min , and then with Alexa Fluor594 secondary antibody directed against goat IgG for another 30 min in buffer C . Actin ( 1 . 9 µ M ) , profilin ( 1 . 3 µ M ) and 1 / 50 ( Fig . 4 , A to D ) or 1 / 10 ( Fig . 4 , E to H ) of the labeling mixture were mixed in 40 µ l of buffer [ 20 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 2 mM Tris - HCl , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 2 . 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA , 100 mM KCl , 10 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mg / ml glucose oxidase , 3 mg / ml glucose , 20 µ g / ml catalase , 0 . 5 % methylcellulose , Oregon Green - phalloidin ] . From the mixture , 2 µ l was immediately placed on a glass slide , and squashed with a PLL - coated ( 2 µ g / ml ) glass coverslip . Time - lapse images were acquired at 22 ° C using an BX52 Olympus microscope and a 60 × objective ( NA 1 . 4 ) . Image acquisition was started after finding actin cloud , which typically took 5 to 10 min . References for Supplemental Material S1 . N . Watanabe , T . Kato , A . Fujita , T . Ishizaki , S .
