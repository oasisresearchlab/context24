One example of such skill is creativity , and the aim of this paper is to measure it . The majority of key competen - cies and skills include the creativity : the report of the World Economic Forum [ 1 ] , scientific research [ 2 , 3 ] , and Russian educational standards [ 4 , 5 ] . To measure complex skills , it is necessary to use both the tradi - tional tests ( question - responses or essay - writing ) and innovative approaches . Very often , innovative approaches are suggested for the testing environment , where it is necessary to solve tasks graphically . This is especially relevant for creative tasks , where the person undergoing the testing is directed to generate a product . Often experts score the generated products . This expert estimation is charac - terized by several disadvantages ( cost of training experts , subjective distortions , delayed feedback , etc . ) [ 6 ] . In addition , to correctly score tasks with graphical solutions , it is not sufficient to take into account each concrete action but the whole product generated during testing . To increase the quality of scoring pro - cedure of such tests , it becomes reasonable to use tech - nologies based on machine learning . Such technologies as machine learning or machine intelligence are being actively developed in many fields , including in education [ 7 ] . For example , it is very common to use automatic text analysis in educa - tional testing [ 8 – 11 ] . Automatic image analysis has not been examined to the degree of detail as text anal - ysis , and it is not used widely . At the same time , one of the most common approaches for creativity assess - ment is image analysis ( traditionally with the partici - pation of experts ) [ 12 ] . The paper introduces a computerized system for creativity assessment using automatic image analysis for overcome the subjectivity of expert scoring and for obtaining other advantages of computer testing : immediate feedback and saving time and resources , as no experts are involved . The aim of this study is to show the possibilities of machine learning for image analysis without experts’ participation in educational testing . 1 . MACHINE LEARNING FOR IMAGE ANALYSIS : APPLICATION EXPERIENCE Images are a large part of big data arrays , such as DNA matrixes , astronomical observations , satellite maps , 3D magnetic resonance images , and computer tomography . To examine these sources of information it is necessary to have complicated instruments , which should be comfortable for application . In [ 13 ] , it was described a set of algorithms for processing images in Python environment with open initial code . In educational testing , it is necessary to use machine learning for image analysis , as the task can be solved graphically . In [ 14 ] , it was used a procedure for image procession , where images are arguments under solving the scientific problem . Using statistical analy - sis , a correlation between image featuresand students’ performance in writing of scientific texts was shown . Graphical solutions can be identified in studies on suturing skills [ 15 , 16 ] . It was found that a simple com - puter algorithm can extract variables of digital images of surgical sutures and provide immediate feedback . 372 SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION PROCESSING Vol . 49 No . 5 2022 UGLANOVA et al . This approach is used as an educational instrument for suturing objective quality assessment – a basic skill for many medical specializations . In [ 16 ] , it was shown that the metrics obtained by image analysis are statis - tically significant for differentiating suturing skills by qualified and first - time surgeons . Automatic image procession can be used in other instruments for psychological and educational testing . For example , for measuring such skills as imagination [ 17 ] and creativity [ 18 , 19 ] . It is necessary to point out that in Russia , the field of automatic image analysis is just beginning to develop for psychology and educa - tion [ 20 ] . 2 . METHODOLOGY 2 . 1 . Instrument , Procedure , Sample In this study we examine the instrument “4K” for 21st - century skills assessment among fourth - graded schoolchildren . The instrument was developed in the Centre for Psychometrics and Measurements in Edu - cation ( Laboratory for New Constructs and Test Design ) of Institute of Education of HSE University ( in the framework of the Contribution to the Future project on scientific work for developing the instru - ments for 4K skills assessment ) . This instrument consists of six scenario - based tasks for the assessment of four skills : critical thinking , cre - ativity , communication , and cooperation . In general , in the 4K instrument , the following tendency is seen : one task aims to assess several skills simultaneously . In this study we examine one of the six tasks “Monster” , developed primarily for creativity assessment . The instrument is given to students in computer form . The task screen is interactive : students select the chosen area , and after that he sees the tested system’s reaction prepared in advance . Such format makes it possible to demonstrate the complex skills , keeps the motivation of students and decreases test anxiety . At the same time the real environment simulation makes it possible to fix the observed behavior , i . e . , to show that the student have the concrete skills . To develop the instrument , the authors define the theoretical framework of creativity construct [ 21 ] based on classical and modern theories [ 3 , 12 , 22 , 23 ] . In this study , we define creativity as an ability to pres - ent and develop the approaches on problem solution , answers the questions arising before the person or ways for solving the everyday problems . The creativity consists of two sub - constructs : • originality – the ability to generate new ideas and problems solutions , which can be expressed in new ideas and unobvious relations between existed ideas . • elaboration – the ability to study in details the presented idea . In the task “Monster , ” each student create three monsters using predefined set of elements and accord - ing to the student these monsters are amazing , unusual and differed from the other monsters in the town . There are several groups of elements ( body , mouth , eyes , etc . ) . Each element can be used more than once . Figure 1 depicts the task interface . Several monsters are shown on the screen as references for the originality of the generated monsters . The indicators according to three generated mon - sters are kept to each student . For scoring the original - ity the six dichotomous indicators are used . Value “1” is set , if : – legs position is differed from the reference ( not in the bottom part of body ) ; – hands position is differed from the reference ( not in upper part of the body ) ; – moth position is differed from the reference ( not in the bottom part of the body ) ; – eyes position is differed from the reference ( not in the upper part of the body ) ; – there are more than onebody ; – hands and legs are not symmetrical . To estimate elaboration , two dichotomous indica - tors are used : value “1” is set , if monster’s color is changed and if the rotation procedure is applied to the elements of the monster ; and seven indicators for gen - eral number of elements and the number of elements are chosen from each group . The sample was 1780 fourth grade students from three Russian cities ( Moscow , Kaluga , and Yaroslavl’ ) . The average time to complete the task was 10 min . Because each student created three monsters , the ini - tial database consisted of 5340 images . When profiles with missing values were removed , the number of monsters in the database was decreased to 5286 ( 1762 student profiles ) . Fig . 1 .

Methodology for Data Analysis Data are analyzed in two stages . The first stage aims to generate the labels over classes for training of the neural network . The results of psychometric data analysis in Latent Class Analysis ( LCA ) is the source of information for labels . In this study , we score according to the product of students’ activity ( the images of monsters ) for two creativity sub - constructs ( originality and elaboration ) separately . At the second stage the neural network architecture was chosen and the neural network was trained . 1 stage . The latent class analysis is a part of a mixed model methodology and it makes possible to reveal latent classes of students according to a group of indi - cators . In contrast to cluster analysis , the base of LCA is a mathematical model , which makes it possible to estimate how suitable the presented classification model is to the data . Let there be M observed binary indicators . The model supposesthat all M observed indicators form the unobserved category variable c consisting of K classes . The LCA model includes two key parameters : the size of latent classes and the conditional probability of indicators . The size of latent class p k determines the proportion of students in class k ; in this case , each stu - dent is an attribute of only one class , i . e . . The conditional probabilities of indicators t mk describe the correlation between the observed indicator value m and the estimation of category latent variable c ( in analogy with the factor loadings in the factor analysis methodology ) . In other words , the conditional proba - bility of the indicator determines the probability of the student from latent class k to be attributed to a certain category of the observed indicator ( in the binary case , to one of two categories , where 1 is the presence of the attribute , and 0 indicates absence of the attribute ) . Classes are compared according to conditional probability values and according to the odds ratio . The odds ratio shows how much higher the chance is to detect the attribute in one class with respect to another one ( reference ) . Let there be two classes , where the first class is the reference one . In this case , if the odds ratio is higher than 1 , the chance to detect the attribute is higher in the second class than the first one . If the odds ratio is less than 1 , the chance to detect the attri - bute is higher in the first class . To determine the structure of the LCA model , i . e . , to reveal an optimal number of latent classes with dif - ferent levels of construct , an exploratory approach is performed . A set of models with different numbers of classes ( the number of classes is set by the researcher ) is generated . The best model is chosen according to the follow - ing criteria . The quality of classification is determined according to the entropy index , where a value higher than0 . 8 is acceptable [ 24 ] . The models with a different 1 1 k k i p = =  number of classes are compared according to Akaike information criterion ( AIC ) and according to Bayes information criterion ( BIC ) in favor of models , where the criterion is minimal . In addition the Lo - Mendell - Rubin Adjusted Likelihood Ratio Test ( LRT ) is used for comparing models where the number of classes dif - fers by one . The significance of this criterion indicates that the model with the lower number of classes is less fit to data . According to [ 23 ] , preference is given to the model where the minimal proportion of observations in one class is not lower than 8 % . In this study , the number of latent classes charac - terizes the number of classes for monsters with differ - ent levels of originality and elaboration . The LCA results are the initial labels for neural network training and machine learning application . The analysis is done in the program Mplus , version 8 . 3 [ 26 ] . 2 stage . Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence , on the boundary between mathematical statistics , optimization methods , and classical mathe - matical disciplines . It studies the generation algo - rithms sufficient for learning . One of the commonest problems in the field of machine learning is the classi - fication problem . This class of problems refers to supervised learning , in which it is necessary to reveal general pattern according to the final set of precedents . The identification process can be automated using a binary image classifier . Among all of the machine learning algorithms , the most efficient are deep learning algorithms . Deep learning is a collection of machine learning algorithms based on learning representation , not by specialized algorithms adapted to a concrete problem . The multi - ple layers of artificial neural networks condition the learning depth . In 1998 , LeCun published an article on a new neu - ral network architecture [ 27 ] , which did not receive attention until 2012 , when competitions on machine vision on the base of ImageNet datawere performed [ 28 ] . Convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) , which are able to classify millions of images with an error of 15 . 2 % , was presented at this competition . From 2012 , the quality of convolutional neural networks has been increasing and becoming comparable with human possibilities [ 29 ] ( Fig . 2 ) . The basis of CNN operations is in filters that rec - ognize image patterns . These filters consist of cores presenting themselves as matrices of numbers . Cores move along the image and identify the presence of a pattern in concrete segments . Identification is per - formed by convolution operations , i . e . , by summing the product of filter elements and the input signals matrix [ 30 ] . A high value of convolution means a pat - tern is found in the decision area . Sub - discretizing layers ( pooling layers ) are placed between convoluting layers , and they are responsible for image compression by summing pixel blocks . 374 SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION PROCESSING Vol . 49 No . 5 2022 UGLANOVA et al . As a result , passing through convoluting and pool - ing layers , the image is presented as a set of convolu - tion maps ( feature maps ) , forming a fully connected layer . The neural network learning is performed by means of error back propagation , to control the weight of each neuron proportionally to its deposition into the total error . Because neural network learning from zero is a complicated computation process , we use the transfer learning procedure , which is widely used in the prob - lem on computer vision in medical images [ 31 ] . In transfer learning , neural network knowledge ( weight - ing ) training for one problem is transferred to another problem . The comparative performances of the most com - mon architectures of pre - training neural networks are presented in Table 1 . The classification of such images is not a standard problem , so the model is chosen by considering the number of layers . The model Dense net 201 [ 32 ] has the greatest number of layers of all mentioned models . Initially , this network was trained for problems with 1000 classes . Our problem is binary classification , so the number of neurons in the last layer should be equal to 2 . It is possible to add several fully connected layers before the last layer , consisting of two neurons . Before applying machine learning methods to image analysis , it is necessary to process the data – to balance classes for better training and stability of the model . For class balancing , we use data augmentation , which makes it possible to generate additional data for training by using the existed ones . For images , it is implemented by rotating images , changing color or reflecting with respect to the horizontal . 3 . RESULTS We compare LCA model with a different number of classes for the originality sub - construct , and the results are presented in Table 2 . Preference is given to two - class solutions with the highest entropy of the model ( 0 . 833 ) . The table indi - cates that if the number of classes is increased , the entropy index decreases . The maximal values of infor - mation criteria are seen in the model with four classes . Nevertheless , in three - class and four - class solutions , small classes form . It is difficult to interpret a small class , and it is not efficient to use it for neural network training . Let us examine in detail the images of monsters which were assigned to the first and second classes . Table 3 depicts the odds ratio according to each indi - cator . Category > 1 means that the indicator is binary , where category = 1 means that creativity is presented , while category = 0 means that there is no creativity . An odds ratio higher than 1 makes it possible to say that the original features according to the respective indi - cator are more pronounced for the second class mon - sters than for first class monsters . According to the results of the division into two classes , all monsters in the second class have one body ( i . e . , the originality factor for all monsters of this group are equal to zero ) therefore , the odds ratio for this indicator is not shown . Monsters from the first class ( 69 % of all monsters ) are differentiated by originality according to all indica - tors . Monsters from the second class ( 31 % of all mon - sters ) are differentiated from the reference : their limbs are not symmetrical , the eyes are in the lower parts , etc . Hereby , according to all indicators , the odds ratio is higher than 1 , which makes it possible to say that mon - sters in the first class are most likely not original , and monsters in the second class are most likely original . The same analysis was performed for revealing the latent classes with different levels of elaboration as a creativity sub - construct . All of the indicators showing the number of elements from different groups are transformed into an ordinal scale ( from 0 up to 6 ) by considering category fullness . Fig . 2 .

The two - class solution shows a high quality of qualification with respect to other models . Therefore , we choose the model with two classes . To characterize the classes , we can examine the odds ratios ( Table 4 ) . Odds ratios are presented for each threshold of ordinal indicator . The threshold is the point at which the probability to choose next cate - gory becomes equal to the probability to choose the previous one . For example , the odds ratio for the indi - cator “Others” category > 2 ( 0 . 490 ) means that with respect to the first class , monsters from the second class more probably fall into the second category ( two elements from the group “Others” are used for creat - ing monsters ) . The same interpretation is maintained for other thresholds . According to Table 5 the odds ratios for the elabo - ration model is lower than 1 . Therefore , for the mon - sters in the first class with respect to the second one elaboration features are seen rarely according to respective indicator and threshold . Monsters from the second class more probably consist of a number of ele - ments that are from different groups and to which the rotation is applied . Their color is differed from refer - ence one ( grey ) . Hereby , the second class ( 84 % of all monsters ) is characterized by high level of elaboration , according to all indicators ( more probable are elaborated ) with respect to the first class ( 16 % of all monsters ) , for which the level of elaboration is lower . The obtained division for classes is the initial labels for training the neural network and for applying machine learning at the second stage for analysis . The quality of neural network operation for identi - fying image originality is verified using a test dataset consisting of 1243 images ( 622 are original , and 621 are not ) ( Table 6 ) using a confusion matrix . A confu - sion matrix is a table , which makes it possible to visu - alize the classification algorithm efficiency by com - paring the predicting value of a target variable with its real value . From the confusion matrix , it is seen that 151 images of 1243 are identified incorrectly . Because the classes are sufficiently balanced , accuracy can be used as a metric for classifier assessment : Neural networks were also generated and studied to identify image elaboration . The model was tested at the sample also consisting of 1243 images ( 622 are Accuracy ( 606 486 ) / 606 486 135 16 ) 0 . 88 . = + + + + = Table 2 .

In particular , we presented the results of automated image analysis as an instrument for esti - mating students’ creativity at the end of elementary school . One problem with such testing is the reliance on expert judgment , which increases test resource - intensity ( time and money for expert training ) . Fur - ther , the feedback for the test results is not quick , and it is subjective . Another problem is mixing character - istics of the student within expert assessment . Since the instrument for creativity measurement “4K” assesses creativity consisting of two sub - constructs ( originality and elaboration ) , we can expect that the expert proposes more elaborated images as original ones and vice - versa . Automatic image analysis due to the use of machine learning makes it possible to overcome these problems . For the fruitful substitution of expert scor - ing by automated machine learning , it is necessary to obtain data of sufficient quality and to present proper initial labels for network training . Data quality in educational testing depends , first of all , on the quality of measurement instruments . The preliminary analysis of measurement instruments proves its high psychometric characteristics [ 21 ] . In our study , the labels are obtained without experts participation . For this purpose we use the model of latent class analysis ( LCA ) , for which the data sources are as follows : presence and indirect indi - cation of objects’ position in the interface due to image creation . To obtain the elaboration values , we analyze the total number of added elements , element rotation , and color variation . This is because originality is mea - sured asdifference from the reference . LCA model shows that it is optimal to draw a division into two classes according to elaboration and originality evi - dences . The division into two classes according to each sub - constructs is the basis for neural network training . For the given problem , we choose the pre - training neural network model Densenet [ 32 ] . The prediction accu - racy is 0 . 88 for the elaboration factor and 0 . 88 for the originality factor . Taking into account the specificity of the construct for which the assessment is per - formed , we suppose that this result is sufficiently high . In contrast to the majority of works dealing with com - puter vision , where the difference between classes is evident , and the presence of any pattern means that the object is a member of the class , in our research , the differences between classes are less apparent . There - fore , the neural network architecture is chosen itera - tively . In addition to Densenet , we tested the following neural network models : Inception , AlexNet , ResNet , and VGG . Among the limitations of this study , we identify the following : small sample for neural network training , and each student creates three monsters . Hereby , it is possible to say that images are in higher agreement to each other than if each image was created by an inde - pendent student . The three images is the required for obtaining accurate creativity evidence . Therefore , in the further studies for analyzing separate images and on presenting individual feedback to the student , it is necessary to consider the source of this variation . Let us point out that validation and rationale of creativity theoretical framework is not the aim of our study . The paper is important for interdisciplinary research on data and education . The idea to use meth - ods of machine learning for educational testing is the new and prospective field for solving theoretical and Table 5 . Odds ratio for elaboration model * р < 0 . 05 .
