G . ) Abstract : Via inhalation we are continuously exposed to environmental and occupational irritants which can induce adverse health effects , such as irritant - induced asthma ( IIA ) . The airway epithelium forms the ﬁrst barrier encountered by these agents . We investigated the effect of environmental and occupational irritants on the airway epithelial barrier in vitro . The airway epithelial barrier was mimicked using a coculture model , consisting of bronchial epithelial cells ( 16HBE ) and monocytes ( THP - 1 ) seeded on the apical side of a permeable support , and human lung microvascular endothelial cells ( HLMVEC ) grown on the basal side . Upon exposure to graphene ( G ) and graphene oxide ( GO ) in a suspension with fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , ammonium persulfate ( AP ) , sodium persulfate ( SP ) and hypochlorite ( ClO − ) , the transepithelial electrical resistance ( TEER ) and ﬂux of ﬂuorescent labelled dextran ( FD4 - ﬂux ) , was determined . Exposure to graphene nanoparticles ( GNPs ) induced an immediate negative effect on the epithelial barrier , whereas ClO − only had a negative impact after 24 h of exposure . AP and SP did not affect the barrier properties . The tight junctions ( TJ ) network showed less connected zonula occludens 1 ( ZO - 1 ) and occludin staining in GNP - exposed cocultures . Functional analysis of the phosphoproteomic data indicated that proteins in the adherens junction ( AJ ) and TJ pathways showed an altered phosphorylation due to GNP exposure . To conclude , the negative effect of GNPs on the epithelial barrier can be explained by the slightly altered the TJ organization which could be caused by alterations in the phosphorylation level of proteins in the AJ and TJ pathway . Keywords : tight junction ; adherens junction ; phosphoproteomics ; graphene nanoparticles ; barrier integrity 1 . Introduction The airway epithelium is located at the interface between the internal and external environment and therefore plays an important role in host defense [ 1 ] . Via intercellular junctional complexes , the airway epithelial cells are tightly connected and create a ﬁrst barrier to the outside world . Intercellular junctions are dynamic structures that confer a loose structure when ions , solutes or immune cells have to pass the epithelial layer , yet also establish an impenetrable fence to harmful agents [ 2 , 3 ] . Intercellular junctional complexes consist of apically localized tight junctions ( TJ ) which regulate paracellular transport of ions and small molecules and establish an apical – lateral polarity , and the underlying adherens junctions ( AJ ) which are important for initiation and maintenance of cell – cell adhesion . TJs are made up of adhesive transmembrane proteins ( e . g . , claudin , occludin and junction adhesion molecule ( JAM ) families ) , actin - binding cytoplasmic proteins ( e . g . , zonula occlu - dens ( ZO ) proteins 1 , 2 and 3 ) and associated scaffolding proteins . The principal proteins in Nanomaterials 2021 , 11 , 1283 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / nano11051283 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / nanomaterials Nanomaterials 2021 , 11 , 1283 2 of 16 AJs are the cadherin and nectin transmembrane protein family and intracellular β - catenin , α - catenin and p120 catenin [ 4 , 5 ] . Various types of environmental and occupational agents , such as allergens , pollution particles and respiratory tract viruses can impair the epithelial barrier integrity by dis - turbing the intercellular junctional complexes , and therefore lead to detrimental health consequences [ 4 , 5 ] . Dysregulation of the TJ and AJ has been implicated in a variety of pul - monary conditions , including asthma , rhinosinusitis and COPD [ 6 – 8 ] . In the current study , we aimed to investigate the effect of different types of environmental and occupational irritants on the airway epithelium . Exposure to respiratory irritants , either at a high dose or repeatedly lower doses , can result in the development of an asthmatic syndrome termed irritant - induced asthma ( IIA ) [ 9 , 10 ] . Because the airway epithelium is the ﬁrst line of cells that come into contact with respiratory irritants , its response upon irritant exposure might provide insight in the ﬁrst steps towards development to IIA . Since their discovery , graphene nanoparticles ( GNPs ) have gained considerable at - tention and research and applications have emerged rapidly [ 11 , 12 ] . Graphene consists of a single - atom thick , two - dimensional sheet of carbon atoms , resulting in a unique platelet - like shape . The GNP sheets are able to penetrate deep into the lungs , where they pose a possible risk for respiratory health [ 13 , 14 ] . Various studies investigated the toxic - ity of GNPs in vitro , however their effect on the epithelial barrier has not been studied before [ 13 , 15 – 18 ] . In this study , the effect induced by GNPs were compared with that of known irritants - hypochlorite and persulfate salts . Hypochlorite ( ClO − ) is a chlorine deriva - tive , used as household bleach and swimming pool disinfectant , which can exert a variety of respiratory symptoms , including IIA [ 19 ] through direct contact with the respiratory epithelium mediated by oxidative tissue injury [ 20 , 21 ] . Persulfate salts are an important component of hair bleaching powder [ 22 ] ; and have been identiﬁed as the main causal agents in occupational asthma in hairdressers , with limited information on the mechanism of the hypersensitive airway disorder [ 23 – 26 ] . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Cell Culture The human bronchial epithelial cells , 16HBE14o - ( 16HBE ) and THP - 1 cells ( a hu - man acute monocytic cell line ) , were cultured in DMEM / F12 and RPMI medium , respec - tively [ 27 , 28 ] . Human lung microvascular endothelial cells ( HLMVEC ) were cultured in human lung microvascular endothelial cell growth medium [ 27 ] . The medium was re - newed every 2 – 3 days , and when conﬂuent , the 16HBE and HLMVEC cells were released enzymatically ( 0 . 05 % trypsin - EDTA ) and transferred to a new culture ﬂask [ 27 , 28 ] . 2 . 2 . Exposure Conditions Graphene nanoparticles ( GNPs ) were purchased from Graphene - supermarket . com . Graphene ( G ) has a lateral dimension of 2 to 8 µ m and consists of 3 to 8 graphene monolay - ers based on the manufacturer’s description . Graphene oxide ( GO ) has a ﬂake size of 0 . 5 to 5 µ m and contains 80 % of graphene oxide monolayers . Figure 1 shows the Raman spectra of G and GO provided from the manufacturer . For G , the high intense peak at 1583 cm − 1 ( G band ) and a low intense peak between 2500 and 3000 cm − 1 ( 2D band ) indicate that the provided G consists of multiple layers of graphene ( Figure 1a ) . The Raman spectrum of GO shows the graphene characterizing peak at 1586 cm − 1 ( G band ) and a peak between 1270 and 1450 cm − 1 ( D band ) that indicates the different structure in the graphene layer due to the oxygen binding ( Figure 1c ) . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) images of the G and GO particles in suspension with 2 % FCS are shown in Figure 1 . The particle dimensions stated by the manufacturer correspond to the dimensions observed on the acquired TEM images . Based on the ‘darkness’ of the particles , it can be visualized that the G sheets mostly consisted of multiple layers , and few monolayers were present ( Figure 1b ) . For GO , aggregated monolayers as well as monolayers were observed ( Figure 1d ) . The levels of endotoxin in the sample suspensions were evaluated using the Endosafe ® - PTS Nanomaterials 2021 , 11 , 1283 3 of 16 Limuluss Amoebocyte Lysate ( LAL ) assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The sensitivity of the assay we used was 0 . 05 EU / mL . 2 Figure 1 . Characterization of G and GO NPs—Raman spectrum provided from the manufacturer of ( a ) G and ( c ) GO . Representative transmission electron spectroscopy ( TEM ) images of ( b ) G and ( d ) GO . The GNPs were weighed and dispersed in sterile water ( Baxter ) containing 2 vol % FCS ( = dispersion medium ) at a concentration of 2 . 56 mg / mL . These stock suspensions were dispersed using a Microson ultrasonic cell disruptor ( Microsonix , Newton , MA , USA ) , equipped with a disruptor horn , in a glass beaker on ice for 16 min at 730 watts [ 28 ] . Intermediate concentrations were made in the dispersion medium and afterwards diluted tenfold in the culture medium to obtain ﬁnal concentrations . The levels of endotoxin in the sample suspensions were evaluated using the Endosafe ® - PTS Limuluss Amoebocyte Lysate ( LAL ) assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The sensitivity of the assay we used was 0 . 05 EU / mL [ 28 ] . To prepare the ﬁnal ammonium persulfate ( AP ) and sodium persulfate ( SP ) solutions for the experiments , AP and SP salts were weighed and dissolved in culture medium containing 0 . 2 % FCS . Sodium hypochlorite with 13 % active chlorine ( act . Cl ) was dissolved and diluted in dispersion medium , to obtain ﬁnal concentrations that are expressed as parts per million ( ppm ) of act . Cl in the ﬁnal hypochlorite ( ClO − ) solution . 2 . 3 . Cytotoxicity Measurements In order to determine sub - toxic concentrations for exposure in the coculture , two dif - ferent cytotoxicity assays were performed on 16HBE monocultures . The cells were seeded in a 96 - well plate at a density of 200 , 000 cells / cm 2 . The next day , the cells were washed with serum - free culture medium and subsequently exposed to increasing concentrations of G , GO , AP , SP and ClO − . After the incubation period of 24 h , the lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) and the 2 - ( 4 - Iodophenyl ) - 3 - ( 4 - nitrophenyl ) - 5 - ( 2 , 4 - disulfophenyl ) - 2H - tetrazolium ( WST - 1 ) assay , cytotoxicity was estimated according to methods previously described [ 28 ] . Nanomaterials 2021 , 11 , 1283 4 of 16 2 . 4 . Coculture 2 . 4 . 1 . Setup A coculture model of the lung – blood barrier , using human bronchial epithelial cells ( 16HBE14o - ) , monocytes ( THP - 1 ) and human lung microvascular endothelial cells ( HLMVEC ) was established according to method described previously [ 27 , 28 ] . Brieﬂy , the HLMVECs were seeded the on the lower side of a non - coated polyester Transwell ® insert membrane ( 0 . 4 µ m pore density and 0 . 33 cm 2 surface area , Sigma - Aldrich , Overijse , Belgium ) followed by seeding of 16HBE cells on the upper side . A total of 4 days after seeding , the THP - 1 cells were added to the apical compartment in a 1 / 10 ratio with the 16HBE cells . The medium in the apical compartment consisted of a mix of 16HBE ( 9 / 10 ) and THP - 1 ( 1 / 10 ) medium with 0 . 2 % FCS [ 27 , 28 ] . 2 . 4 . 2 . Exposure On day 5 in culture , the cocultures were exposed on the apical compartment of the transwell insert . Concentrations of 64 or 256 µ g / mL for G , 16 or 64 µ g / mL for GO , 25 or 100 µ g / mL for AP or 12 . 5 or 6 . 25 µ g / mL for SP and 7 . 5 or 3 . 75 ppm act . Cl in ClO − in a medium containing a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 2 % FCS were used . Control cocultures were treated with the vehicle culture medium containing 0 . 2 % FCS . 2 . 4 . 3 . Measurement of the Transepithelial Electrical Resistance ( TEER ) The transepithelial electrical resistance ( TEER ) was measured using the Evom Voltohm - meter supplemented with the End - Ohm chamber or STX2 chopstick ( World Precision Instruments Inc . , Sarasota , FL , USA ) , at 30 min , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 and 24 h after the start of exposure , as previously described [ 27 ] . 2 . 4 . 4 . Paracellular Flux of Fluorescent Labelled Dextran Paracellular ﬂux of uncharged molecules was investigated by measuring passage of apically added markers across the cell layer as previously described [ 28 ] . Fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated 4 kDa - dextran ( 46 , 944 Sigma - Aldrich , Overijse , Belgium ) was added to the apical surface at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mg / mL . After 4 h of incubation at 37 ◦ C , triplicate basolateral samples were taken for assaying ( excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm ) [ 28 ] on a black 96 - well plate . The ﬂux or change in concentration was calculated by dividing the concentration and volume of the basolateral compartment by the concentration and volume of the apical compartment and expressed as a percentage . 2 . 4 . 5 . Staining of the Intercellular Junctional Proteins Integrity of the tight junction was assessed using immunoﬂuorescent staining of pro - teins zonula occludens 1 ( ZO - 1 ) and occludin . After the exposed cocultures were washed , ﬁxed with ice - cold methanol for 10 min at − 20 ◦ C and permeabilized with 0 . 3 % Triton - X100 for 10 min , the coculture was blocked with 1 % BSA solution for 1 h and incubated successively with Alexa Fluor ® 488 - conjugated mouse anti - human ZO1 antibody ( 1 / 100 , ThermoFisher , Gent , Belgium ) and Alexa Fluor ® 594 - conjugated mouse anti - human Oc - cludin antibody ( 1 / 100 , ThermoFisher , Gent , Belgium ) for 2 h in 0 . 5 % BSA solution . The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI ( 1 / 500 ) for 10 min . Finally , the membranes were excised from the insert and mounted using ProLong ® Gold Antifade Mountant ( Ther - moFisher , Gent , Belgium ) . Images were taken with an Olympus BX61 microscope using the XC30 camera at × 40 magniﬁcation . 2 . 5 . Phosphoproteomics 16HBE cells were exposed to 64 mg / mL of G or GO for 24 h , and after this the cells were washed and lysed using the Mem - PER™ Plus membrane protein extraction kit ( ThermoFisher , Gent , Belgium ) supplemented with 1 mM Phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride ( PMSF ) and phosSTOP™ ( Sigma - Aldrich , Overijse , Belgium ) to extract the membrane - Nanomaterials 2021 , 11 , 1283 5 of 16 associated proteins , according to the manufacturers’ instructions . Membrane protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) protein assay ( ThermoFisher , Gent , Belgium ) . A total of 180 µ g of membrane fraction lysates were subjected to reduction ( 5 mM DTT ) and alkylation ( 25 mM iodoacetamide ) followed by precipitation [ 29 ] . The proteins were digested overnight using 4 µ g trypsin at 37 ◦ C in 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate , 5 % acetonitrile , 0 . 01 % ProteaseMax ( Promega , Belgium ) . The resulting peptides were desalted with C18 Spin Columns ( Harvard Apparatus , Holliston , MA , USA ) and subjected to phosphopeptide enrichment on IMAC beads ( PHOS - Select iron afﬁnity gel , Sigma - Aldrich , Overijse , Belgium ) . The resulting peptides were desalted with C18 ZipTip pipette tips ( Millipore ) and subjected to high - resolution LC - MS / MS using an Ultimate 3000 nano UPLC system interfaced with a Q Exactive hybrid quadrupole - orbitrap mass spectrometer via an EASY - spray ( C - 18 , 50 cm ) column ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) [ 30 ] . Progenesis software ( Nonlinear Dynamics ) was used for relative quantiﬁcation of pep - tides . Peptides were identiﬁed by MASCOT ( Matrix Science ) using SwProt _ trEMBL _ homo sapiens ( 71 , 785 sequences ) as a database via Proteome Discoverer 2 . 2 software , incorpo - rating Percolator for peptide validation and ptmRS for PTM localization . The following search parameters were used—phosphorylation ( STY ) in combination with oxidation ( M ) as variable modiﬁcations and carbamidomethylation ( C ) was used as a ﬁxed modiﬁcation . Three missed cleavages were allowed for trypsin digestion . Peptide tolerance was set at 10 ppm and MS / MS tolerance at 20 mmu . Only peptides with a high ( PEP < 0 . 01 ) and middle ( PEP < 0 . 05 ) identiﬁcation conﬁdence were considered . The peptide and protein abundancies of the NP - exposed cells were divided by those of the control cells , to quantify the change in phosphorylation . If the ratio of phosphopeptide abundance of the NP - exposed cells compared to that of the control cells was larger or equal than 1 . 5 , or smaller or equal than 0 . 5 , these proteins were considered as relevantly hyper - or hypophosphorylated . These unique proteins were selected as per the type of NP and were further investigated . Functional analysis of the selected proteins was performed using the DAVID web tool for their involvement in cell pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) database ( https : / / www . genome . jp / kegg / ; accessed on 26 June 2018 ) [ 31 – 33 ] . As a background , the DAVID - supported ‘Homo sapiens’ gene set was used . 2 . 6 . Statistical Analysis The results are represented as mean ± SD or mean with individual values . Normality distribution was determined using the d’Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test . When normally distributed , the data were analyzed with a one - way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple - comparison test . When the data were not normally distributed , the Kruksal – Wallis test followed by a Dunn’s multiple comparison test was used . Time series of the TEER measurements were analyzed with a two - way ANOVA ( Graphpad Prism 5 . 00 , Graphpad Software Inc . , San Diego , CA , USA ) . A level of p < 0 . 05 was considered signiﬁcant [ 28 ] . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Effect on Transepithelial Electrical Resistance ( TEER ) Changes in ion permeability of the cell layers due to irritant exposure were exam - ined using measurement of the transepithelial electrical resistance ( TEER ) . Cocultures were apically exposed to 64 or 256 µ g / mL G , 16 or 64 µ g / mL GO , 25 or 100 µ g / mL AP , 12 . 5 or 6 . 25 µ g / mL SP , 7 . 5 or 3 . 75 ppm act . Cl in ClO − , or fresh medium ( Ctrl ) . These concentrations were sub - toxic for 16HBE cells , as determined by LDH and WST - 1 assay ( Figure 2 ) . TEER was recorded immediately before and at different time points ( 30 min , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 and 24 h ) after the start of the exposure . Exposure to each tested concentration of G resulted in an immediate and persistent decrease in TEER compared to the vehicle - exposed control Nanomaterials 2021 , 11 , 1283 6 of 16 ( Figure 3 ) . Exposure to GO also induced a signiﬁcant immediate decrease in TEER , which stayed signiﬁcantly lower than the control for a concentration of 64 µ g / mL ( Figure 3 ) . When the cocultures were exposed to AP or SP this did not result in changes in TEER compared to the control coculture ( Figure 3 ) . Both concentrations of active chlorine in ClO − initially did not alter the TEER , yet 24 h after the start of the exposure a signiﬁcant decrease in TEER compared to the control was found ( Figure 3 ) .

Permeability for FD4 was signiﬁcantly larger than in the control condition after exposure to 256 µ g / mL of G and 64 µ g / mL of GO ( Figure 4a ) . Other tested concentrations of G and GO , and both concentrations ClO − , AP and SP did not signiﬁcantly alter the FD4 - ﬂux after 24 h of exposure .

Of the large number of identiﬁed phosphopeptides , those that had a relevant alteration in phosphorylation level ( i . e . , a NP - exposed versus / Ctrl phosphopepetide abun - dance ratio ≤ 0 . 5 or ≥ 1 . 5 ) were taken into consideration .

The 15 differently phosphorylated proteins in the TJ and AJ pathways due to G , GO or both GNP exposures are depicted in colored boxes . TJ are essential to establish cell polarity and create a selective permeable barrier . The proteins Crumbs , PALS1 and PATJ constitute together the cell polarity complex in epithelial cells . TJs establish cell – cell contacts via transmembrane proteins of the claudin , occludin or junctional adhesion molecules ( JAM ) family and a cytoplasmic ‘plaque’ consisting of different proteins that form a complex and connect to the actin cytoskeleton . AJs are responsible for cellular adhesion in different types of tissues , thereby maintaining tissue architecture and limiting cell movement and proliferation . Cadherin is an essential cell adhesion molecule in AJ . The cytoplasmic tail of cadherin binds β - catenin , which in turn binds α - catenin , which connects to the actin cytoskeleton . Catenin - δ stabilizes the cadherin / β - catenin complex at the cell membrane . Phosphorylation of β - catenin and δ - catenin by receptor protein tyrosine kinases ( RPTKs ) and cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs , e . g . , Fer , Fyn , Yes and Src ) , negatively affects the integrity of the cadherin / catenin complex , leading to its dissociation . The integrity of this complex is positively regulated by dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases and , by phosphorylation by casein kinase II . Changes in β - catenin phosphorylation affects cell – cell adhesion and inﬂuences the cellular location of β - catenin , which , if not associated with cadherin , can degrade or signal as free β - catenin to initiate gene expression . Nectins also function as cell adhesion molecules and transduce signals that reorganize the actin cytoskeleton , regulate AJ formation and strengthen cell – cell adhesion .

Discussion As evaluated by TEER and FD4 - ﬂux , the nanoparticles G and GO immediately had a negative impact on the epithelial barrier , whereas ClO − only had a negative impact after 24 h of exposure . Exposure to AP and SP did not alter the barrier properties . Next , Nanomaterials 2021 , 11 , 1283 13 of 16 evaluation of the TJ network using immunoﬂuorescent staining of ZO - 1 and occludin , indicated that cocultures exposed to G or GO had a slightly less connected TJ network . In a large set of membrane - associated proteins , we found using phosphoproteomics that the proteins in the AJ and TJ pathways were signiﬁcantly hypo - or hyperphosphorylated due to GNP exposure , which therefore provides an explanation for the observed negative effect on the airway epithelial barrier . An intact epithelial barrier is crucial , since disruption will enhance the permeability , which will lead to increased penetration of potentially harmful agents towards the host . Therefore , in the ﬁrst part of this study , we evaluated the effect of GNPs and compared our observations to other environmental agents on the airway epithelial barrier . It was found that the GNPs had an immediate and persistent negative effect on the airway epithelial barrier . In comparison , the oxidizing chemicals sodium and ammonium persulfate did not have a negative effect on the barrier using the applied concentrations . Exposure to hypochlorite , on the other hand , impaired the barrier after 24 h of exposure . Transepithelial electrical resistance ( TEER ) measures the passage of ions and small molecules across the cell layers , whereas the ﬂux of ﬂuorescent - labeled dextran determines the paracellular transport of macromolecules [ 34 ] . In our experiments , these two parameters corresponded well and showed signiﬁcant changes in FD4 - ﬂux and TEER for the highest tested concentration of G and GO . According to the WST - 1 and LDH assay to determine cytotoxicity due to environmental exposure in 16HBE , these concentrations were non - cytotoxic . In a second part , we further wanted to investigate the interaction of the GNPs with the epithelium . To investigate whether G and GO could destroy the intercellular junctions , we stained for the TJ proteins occludin and ZO - 1 . These are important TJ proteins that surround epithelial cells in a belt - like manner . After exposure to G and GO , the organization of the TJ belts was slightly altered , and still clearly present . The fact that the deposited G and GO particles appear black on the images makes it difﬁcult to distinguish ‘disorganization of the TJ network’ from the black particles . Attempts to quantify our observations on the images were therefore unsuitable , making this only an indicative ﬁnding . In addition , not only the expression of the intercellular junctional proteins , but also their post - translational modiﬁcations ( PTMs ) determine the proper functioning of these proteins . In a way to screen for alterations in a large set of proteins of the intercellular junctions , we performed a phosphoproteome analysis . Phosphorylation is a dynamic and important PTM that has been shown to regulate folding , binding , location and stability of intercellular junction proteins [ 35 ] . Using a phosphoproteome analysis on the membrane - associated proteins , we could evaluate a large set of proteins , providing us substantial information on the alterations due to NP exposure . Selecting the proteins that were signiﬁcantly hypo - or hyperphosphorylated indicated that graphene oxide altered a slightly larger number of proteins than graphene . The analysis revealed speciﬁc enrichment for spliceosome components and that of ribosome biogenesis for both G and GO , as these pathways are tightly coupled . Changes in similar pathways have been observed for crude oil on human airway epithelial cells , where RNA - seq analyses revealed enrichment in ribosomal biosynthesis ( hsa03008 ) and spliceosome ( hsa03040 ) [ 36 ] . Interestingly ribosome biogenesis has also been linked to onco - genic signaling , including that of c - Myc [ 37 , 38 ] . Transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes in children with therapy - resistant asthma ( SA ) and controlled persistent asthma has revealed enrichment of pathways associated with ribosomal proteins , RNA transport and the spliceosome [ 39 ] . Also , in the context of development of severe asthma , KEGG enrichment of the spliceosome ( mRNAs ; SF3A1 , SNRPE , SF3B4 ) has been observed [ 40 ] . Speciﬁc proteins in the KEGG pathway included ACIN1 , serine / arginine - rich splicing factors , and Ubiquitin speciﬁc peptidase , the differential expression of which have been associated with altered cell proliferation and poor cancer prognosis , among others [ 41 – 43 ] . Another speciﬁc protein , SRSF6 ( serine and arginine rich splicing factor 6 ) , observed in our enrichment analysis , has also been shown to be dysregulated in ASM cells from asthmatic horses [ 44 ] . Nanomaterials 2021 , 11 , 1283 14 of 16 Functional analysis of these selected proteins also revealed that for both G and GO , the KEGG pathways AJ and TJ were found in the top ﬁve of signiﬁcantly enriched path - ways , which was in line with our hypothesis that GNP exposure might affect AJ and TJ protein functions . The enrichment in AJ and TJ pathways is speciﬁcally relevant , as such enrichment has also been observed in the Balb / c mice model ( eosinophilic , mixed , and neutrophilic ) of asthma from whole - genome transcriptome proﬁling of the lung , with en - richment in airway TJ [ 45 ] . For some speciﬁc proteins in these pathways , phosphorylation of speciﬁc residues is crucial in their function to maintain cell adhesion via interaction with different proteins ( see Figure 6 ) . Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in occludin , E - cadherin , ZO - 1 and β - catenin have repeatedly been associated with an increased bar - rier permeability , because of a reduced interaction between the proteins [ 35 , 46 , 47 ] . In our dataset of differentially phosphorylated AJ and TJ proteins , tyrosine phosphorylation was only found at Tyr865 in catenin δ - 1 , which is as expected because low abundant phospho - tyrosine phosphorylation is more efﬁciently captured by immunoafﬁnity enrichment than by the more generalistic IMAC enrichment that was used for this study [ 2 , 48 ] . This is a known phosphorylated residue , which , however , has not been described to cause barrier alterations . Not only tyrosine phosphorylation is of importance for interactions between proteins of the AJ or TJ pathway . Phosphorylation of serine at position 641 in α - catenin has been described to disturb the binding between α - catenin and β - catenin , resulting in increased transcriptional activity of β - catenin , as well as reduced association of the cadherin / β - catenin complex with the actin skeleton [ 49 ] . In our experiments , G exposure increased the phosphorylation at Ser641 in catenin α - 1 , which might result in ‘looser’ AJs that contribute to the decreased barrier function . Similarly , we found increased serine phosphorylation at residues 552 and 191 in β - catenin , which has been shown to cause its dissociation from the cell – cell contacts and stabilization of β - catenin in the nucleus , respectively , and thus could be involved in the observed impaired barrier function [ 50 , 51 ] . While such interpretation may be limited due to the present study design , based on evidence presented in the literature , it can be said that enrichment of pathways such as ‘Ri - bosome biogenesis’ , ‘RNA transport’ , ‘Tight junction’ , ‘Adherens junction’ , ‘RNA transport’ and ‘Cell adhesion molecules’ may also be indicative of a possible Epithelial - Mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) that may contribute to airway remodeling in asthma [ 52 – 55 ] . 5 . Conclusions In conclusion , in an in vitro model of the airway epithelial barrier , the nanoparticles G and GO had a negative impact on the barrier properties . To explain the negative impact of GNPs on the epithelial barrier , we evaluated whether the TJ proteins ZO - 1 and occludin were affected . A less organized TJ network was observed after exposure to G and GO , but since the deposited GNP appeared black on the images , this observation was difﬁcult to verify . Using phosphoproteomics , we revealed that the phosphorylation status of proteins of the AJ and TJ pathway changed due to GNP exposure , which could explain the observed negative impact of the GNPs on the epithelial barrier .
