Relaxing local travel behaviours on preventing 24 the spread of COVID - 19 , may increase the infection risk in subsequent waves of SARS - CoV - 25 2 transmission . In this study , we analysed changes in the travel behaviour of different 26 population groups ( adult , child , student , elderly ) during four pandemic waves in Hong Kong 27 before January 2021 , by 4 - billion second - by - second smartcard records of subway . A 28 significant continuous relaxation in human travel behaviour was observed during the four 29 waves of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Residents sharply reduced their local travel by 51 . 9 % , 30 50 . 1 % , 27 . 6 % , and 20 . 5 % from the first to fourth pandemic waves , respectively . The 31 population flow in residential areas , workplaces , schools , shopping areas , amusement areas 32 and border areas , decreased on average by 30 . 3 % , 33 . 5 % , 41 . 9 % , 58 . 1 % , 85 . 4 % and 99 . 6 % , 33 respectively , during the pandemic weeks . We also found that many other cities around the 34 world experienced a similar relaxation trend in local travel behaviour , by comparing traffic 35 congestion data during the pandemic with data from the same period in 2019 . The 36 quantitative pandemic fatigue in local travel behaviour could help governments partially 37 predicting personal protective behaviours , and thus to suggest more accurate interventions 38 during subsequent waves , especially for highly infectious virus variants such as Omicron . 39 40 Keywords : COVID - 19 , local travel behaviour , subway , public transport , traffic congestion 41 42 1 . Introduction 43 44 Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) continues to threaten human life and society . 3 45 Close contact and longer - range airborne are the main SARS - CoV - 2 transmission routes 46 ( Chen et al . , 2022 ; Tang et al . , 2021 ; Zhang et al . , 2021a ) . General non - pharmaceutical 47 interventions ( Miao and Zhang , 2022 ; Zhang et al . , 2021b ; Taylor , 2022 ) such as social 48 distancing , city lock - down , school closure , environmental controls , and personal hygiene had 49 been used in many countries . In some cities , complete lock - down or partial lock - downs have 50 been implemented . Pandemic fatigue is defined by the WHO as demotivation to follow 51 recommended protective behaviours , emerging gradually over time and affected by a number 52 of emotions , experiences and perceptions ( WHO , 2020 ) . This so - called pandemic fatigue has 53 been observed worldwide in terms of adherence to these protective behaviours ( Petherick et 54 al . , 2021 ) . Factors such as the need to reduce the economic burden of these behaviours , and 55 time - varying perceived risk adjustment ( e . g . following the observed reduced death rate ) have 56 been cited as possible explanations . However , the exact mechanism for the occurrence of 57 pandemic fatigue remains unknown . Understanding pandemic fatigue is important , since the 58 efficacy of current vaccines against newer variants is potentially low ( Mahase , 2021 ) . The 59 pandemic fatigue phenomenon might also be an important factor when governments consider 60 easing restrictions to live with the virus . 61 Local travel behaviour is understood to be an indirect indicator that can be used to assess 62 social distancing during a pandemic ( Badr et al . , 2020 ; Zhang et al . , 2021c ) . Due to the 63 pandemic , people did indeed reduce their movement in almost all locations ( Forsyth et al . , 64 2020 ; Irawan et al . , 2022 ) . Public transport , such as subways , play a critical role in virus 65 transmission , particularly in highly populated cities ( Ghosh et al . , 2020 ) . In New York City , 66 the subway ridership decreased by 89 % on average between 23 March and 19 April , 2020 , 4 67 due to the COVID - 19 pandemic ( Teixeira and Lopes , 2020 ) . In Seoul , there was a 41 % 68 reduction in subway ridership during late February , 2020 ( Lee et al . , 2020 ) . In some 69 European cities , ridership of public transport decreased by 80 % ( Bernhardt , 2020 ) . 70 Hence , we proceeded to examine changes in local travel behaviours during subsequent 71 pandemic waves in Hong Kong . Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated regions in 72 the world . In 2003 , Hong Kong recorded 21 . 7 % of all confirmed SARS cases worldwide 73 ( 1755 out of 8906 ) ( WHO , 2003 ) . Major outbreaks of influenza viruses , such as H1N1 , H5N1 74 and H7N9 , have also been reported in Hong Kong ( Tam , 2022 ; Wu et al . , 2010 ; Wu et al . , 75 2013 ) . As of 2 September 2020 , Hong Kong had reported 12 , 113 confirmed cases of COVID - 76 19 ( HKCHP , 2021 ) . There have been four epidemic waves of COVID - 19 since the first case 77 was reported in Hong Kong on January 23 , 2020 . No city - scale lock - down has ever been 78 implemented in Hong Kong , but local government constantly advised people to exercise 79 social distancing during each of the outbreak waves . It is unknown if people in general 80 relaxed their personal protective behaviour . 81 Most of the existing studies of human movement use location data from mobile phones 82 for the analysis . This may introduce bias as mobile phone usage does not reflect the use of 83 public transport . Most passengers use their smartcards when taking public transport , and 84 these records provide accurate data of travel behaviour . Hong Kong has an advanced Metro 85 Transit Railway system , and different demographic groups use different types of smart card 86 such as a student card for example . This system enables us to understand any changes in local 87 travel behaviours of these different population groups . 88 On average , 12 . 6 million passengers use the public transport system per day in Hong 5 89 Kong ( based on ridership statistics from 2013 to 2019 ) ( HKTD , 2020 ) . Previous research 90 looking at influenza transmission , showed that 4 % of infections occurred in subways ( Cooley 91 et al . 2011 ) . Therefore , we used human behaviour connected to subway riding as an index of 92 social distancing and pandemic fatigue . More than 42 % of all Hong Kong commuters use the 93 Mass Transit Railway ( MTR ) system every day , as measured over a recent three - year period 94 ( HKTD , 2020 ) . In this study , we clarified the changes in local travel behaviour via MTR . We 95 collected more than 4 billion smartcard records of MTR use from 1 January 2019 to 31 96 January 2021 . This allows us to understand the impact of the continuous waves of COVID - 19 97 outbreaks on human travel behaviours in Hong Kong , which may in turn reflect personal 98 protective behaviour . 99 100 2 . Method 101 102 2 . 1 Data sources 103 104 The MTR Corporation supplied detailed MTR data covering the period from 1 January 105 2019 to 31 January 2021 . The data includes masked smartcard information ( i . e . the ID of the 106 card was masked and processed without the original card ID ) , entry / exit station , entry / exit 107 time , and card type for each passenger . Four card types were selected for this study : adult ( no 108 discount ) ; child ( ages 3 – 11 years ) ; student ( ages 12 – 25 years and enrolled in a 109 primary / middle / high school , university or institution of higher education ) ; and senior ( 65 110 years and above ) ( Zhang et al . , 2021c ) . 6 111 Other sources of data we collected for this study were : ( 1 ) Reported COVID - 19 data 112 between 23 January 2020 and 31 January 2021 in Hong Kong were obtained from the Centre 113 for Health Protection of Hong Kong ( HKCHP , 2021 ) . We combined the infection data and 114 MTR data to analyse how human travel behaviour changed due to the pandemic and affected 115 the spread of infection . ( 2 ) Reported COVID - 19 data from the start of the pandemic to 31 116 January 2021 for selected cities ( Beijing , Hong Kong , London , Los Angeles , Madrid , 117 Moscow , New Delhi , New York , Paris , Singapore , Tokyo , and Wuhan ) were collected from 118 different sources ( see Appendix A for details ) . ( 3 ) Monthly local public transport data for 119 Hong Kong between January 2019 and January 2021were obtained from the Transport 120 Department of Hong Kong ( HKTD , 2020 ) . ( 4 ) When comparing human travel behaviours 121 among different cities / countries ( Fig . 5 , 6B , and 6C ) , traffic congestion data obtained from 122 TomTom ( www . tomtom . com ) was used as an index for local travel behaviour ( Tanveer et al . , 123 2020 ) . 124 125 2 . 2 Data selection and processing 126 127 Up to 31 January 2021 , Hong Kong experienced four COVID - 19 pandemic waves . We 128 selected four peak pandemic weeks , the week in each pandemic wave that had the highest 129 number of recorded daily cases . The four pandemic weeks are Week 1 ( 26 March to 1 April , 130 2020 ) , Week 2 ( 24 to 30 July , 2020 ) , Week 3 ( 4 to 10 December , 2020 ) , and Week 4 ( 18 to 24 131 January , 2021 ) . Four non - pandemic weeks , with the same dates in 2019 , were used as the 132 control groups . Changes in local travel behaviour could be obtained by comparing a 7 133 passenger’s data during and before the COVID - 19 pandemic , and during the different 134 pandemic weeks . 135 To ensure the accuracy of the results , we removed invalid data based on the following 136 criteria : ( 1 ) There has to be card scanning data for both entering and leaving the system for 137 every passenger . ( 2 ) A passenger cannot enter and leave the same station . ( 3 ) A passenger has 138 to enter and leave the station during MTR operating hours . 139 After this data screening , more than 203 million valid subway ridership records were 140 obtained for the four pandemic and non - pandemic weeks . To identify regular daily commutes 141 amongst all this data , we defined consecutive round trips between the same two stations to be 142 regular commutes ( Zhang et al . , 2021d ) . The effective reproduction number was used to 𝑅 𝑡 143 reflect the real - time severity of virus transmission . It measures changes in the transmissibility 144 of a disease such as COVID - 19 , and represents the average number of secondary infections 145 caused by a single infected individual at time in the partially susceptible population . An 𝑡 146 epidemic will tend to decline when drops below 1 but grow when exceeds 1 . We 𝑅 𝑡 𝑅 𝑡 147 estimated the time - varying from the incidence of COVID - 19 cases and the serial interval 𝑅 𝑡 148 distribution using the method proposed by Cori ( 2020 ) and Thompson et al . ( 2019 ) . 149 Confirmed cases of COVID - 19 from the Hong Kong Government are classified into six types 150 of cases , which are reclassified into imported or local cases as the incidence of COVID - 19 . 151 Asymptomatic cases are excluded in this study since we found that asymptomatic cases can 152 influence the peak value of for each pandemic wave , even though we impute onset date 𝑅 𝑡 153 of asymptomatic cases using a Weibull distribution of symptomatic cases’ onset date . The 154 estimated serial interval for COVID - 19 was assumed to be a normal distribution with a mean 8 155 of 7 . 5 days and a SD of 6 . 0 days . In addition , the serial interval distribution can also be 156 estimated from the interval - censored exposure data using the Markov chain Monte Carlo 157 algorithm . All analyses were carried out using EpiEstim version 2 . 2 - 3 and R version 4 . 0 . 1 158 ( Code is shown in Appendix B ) . 159 When assessing changes in local travel behaviours , a pandemic fatigue score ( ) was 𝑆 𝑃𝐹 160 used ( Eq . 1 ) . The higher the score , the more rapid is the onset of pandemic fatigue . 𝑆 𝑃𝐹 = ( 𝑁 𝑝 , 𝑙𝑤 𝑁 𝑛𝑝 , 𝑙𝑤 ― 𝑁 𝑝 , 𝑓𝑤 𝑁 𝑛𝑝 , 𝑓𝑤 ) × 100 % ∆𝑡 ( 1 ) 161 where ( ) and ( ) are the number of passengers in the first ( last ) 𝑁 𝑝 , 𝑓𝑤 𝑁 𝑝 , 𝑙𝑤 𝑁 𝑛𝑝 , 𝑓𝑤 𝑁 𝑛𝑝 , 𝑙𝑤 162 pandemic ( non - pandemic ) week ; ( month ) is the duration between the first and the last ∆𝑡 163 week . 164 In this study , mobility changes in MTR were represented by the difference ratio of 165 subway ridership in a pandemic week , compared to the average ridership in a non - pandemic 166 control week . In addition , because some students / workers go to school / workplace on 167 Saturdays ( Zhang et al . , 2021c ) , we focused on travel behaviour on weekdays and Sundays . 168 169 2 . 3 Study area 170 171 From the statistics , Hong Kong had a population of 7 . 47 million at the end of 2020 172 ( HKCSD , 2021 ) . The average daily passenger usage of public transport in Hong Kong from 173 January 2019 to May 2021 , was 10 . 6 million ( Figure . S1 ) . In 2019 and 2020 , 37 . 2 % and 174 35 . 2 % of all commuters used the MTR , respectively . In Hong Kong , there are 95 MTR 9 175 stations and 11 lines ( Figure . S2 ) . 176 177 3 . Results 178 179 3 . 1 Temporal local travel behaviours 180 181 Hong Kong had recorded a total of 10 , 453 confirmed cases by 31 January 2021 . Four 182 COVID - 19 pandemic peaks ( including both imported and local cases ) can be seen before 31 183 January 2021 ( Fig . 1A ) . The effective reproduction number is shown in Fig . 1A . The average 184 daily numbers of new cases in the four pandemic weeks were 50 . 7 , 128 . 7 , 100 . 3 , and 75 . 4 , 185 respectively . 186 Local travel behaviour changed a lot due to the pandemic ( Fig . 1B ) . During the non - 187 pandemic weeks , 78 . 6 % , 3 . 4 % , 7 . 8 % and 10 . 2 % of MTR passengers used adult , child , 188 student and senior cards , respectively . Non - pandemic travel on Sundays for adults , students , 189 and older people was 20 . 4 % , 32 . 1 % , and 17 . 5 % , respectively lower than on weekdays . 190 However , child passengers increased by 21 . 5 % on Sundays . The average daily number of 191 passengers during the four chosen pandemic weeks decreased by 51 . 9 % , 50 . 1 % , 27 . 6 % , and 192 20 . 5 % , respectively compared to ridership during the four non - pandemic weeks . Adults , 193 children , students , and older people on average reduced their MTR travel by 39 . 7 % , 80 . 1 % , 194 72 . 5 % , and 35 . 2 % respectively during pandemic weeks . 195 In this study , we assumed that most of the return trips per day were for daily commutes 196 ( e . g . , regular movement between school / workplace and residence ) . All types of passengers 10 197 took more return MTR trips per day during the pandemic weeks than in the non - pandemic 198 weeks ( Fig . 1C ) . Travel behaviour on weekdays was more regular ( 2 trips per day ) than on 199 Sundays . Adults and older people gradually reduced their rate of regular commutes , while 200 children and students became more regular during the four pandemic waves . 201 Subway ridership during the pandemic weeks decreased by 41 . 3 % , 45 . 5 % and 51 . 8 % on 202 weekdays , Saturdays and Sundays , respectively ( Fig . 1D ) . Few people have to go to work on 203 Sundays , which means that more than 50 % of MTR users avoided taking the subway to 204 schools or workplaces if it was not mandatory during the pandemic weeks . During the 205 pandemic , passenger numbers during the peak hours on weekdays , Saturdays , and Sundays , 206 decreased by 41 . 3 % , 57 . 1 % , and 66 . 0 % , respectively . 207 208 209 11 210 211 212 Fig . 1 . Subway ridership behaviour during four non - pandemic and pandemic weeks .

Adults reduced their regular commuters to the 224 workplace by 40 . 3 % , 46 . 4 % , 23 . 6 % , and 12 . 5 % during the weekdays of the four pandemic 225 weeks . At the school area , the numbers of commuters decreased by 95 . 4 % , 93 . 2 % , and 37 . 9 % 226 during the pandemic Weeks 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively ( Week 4 was not considered here because 227 the University station was closed during that week ) . On the non - pandemic weekdays , there 228 was an apparent peak in movement in shopping areas between 6 and 7 p . m . On pandemic 229 Sundays , adults , children , students and older people reduced their visits to shopping areas by 230 55 . 9 % , 77 . 5 % , 73 . 2 % and 55 . 1 % , respectively . The passenger volume to the shopping area 231 decreased by 75 . 4 % , 69 . 9 % , 32 . 5 % , and 45 . 3 % during the four pandemic Sundays , 232 respectively . 233 13 234 235 Fig . 2 . Half - hour subway ridership at residential , workplace , school , shopping area , 236 amusement area , and border stations during the week ( WKD ) and Sundays ( SUN ) of the four 237 non - pandemic and pandemic weeks ( At the workplace and school stations , the data only 238 showed those passengers with regular commutes . At the shopping and amusement area 239 stations , the data only showed those passengers without regular commutes ) . Because there 14 240 was a social movement in Hong Kong in non - pandemic Week 3 , the data from week 3 is not 241 shown here . 242 243 From the pandemic fatigue scores ( Table 1 ) , the most rapid fatigue occurred with 244 workers going to workplaces , with a value of 6 . 5 % per month . This high value showed the 245 social pandemic fatigue with respect to COVID - 19 prevention and control for workers . No 246 further strategies , such as work from home , were implemented during the four pandemic 247 waves . The border areas experienced the least pandemic fatigue , which means that the city 248 lock - down was strictly implemented because of the high morbidity of COVID - 19 in other 249 territories . During weekends , the rapid pandemic fatigue occurred with children going to 250 schools , which means that more weekend classes gradually returned to normal operation . 251 252 Table 1 .

Children and students reduced 255 their travel to amusement area by 98 . 9 % , 98 . 4 % , 96 . 6 % , and 84 . 1 % during the four pandemic 256 weeks . At the largest border point in Hong Kong , almost no passengers entered Lo Wu 257 station during the four pandemic weeks . Overall , during the pandemic weeks , the subway 258 ridership in the residential area , workplace , school , shopping area , amusement area and 259 border decreased by 30 . 3 % , 33 . 5 % , 41 . 9 % , 58 . 1 % , 85 . 4 % and 99 . 6 % , respectively . 260 During non - pandemic weekdays , Tsim Sha Tsui ( 285 , 000 passengers per day ) , Mong 261 Kok ( 275 , 000 passengers per day ) , and Central ( 252 , 000 passengers per day ) had the highest 262 passenger flow . Mong Kok ( 215 , 000 passengers per day ) , Lo Wu ( 209 , 000 passengers per 263 day ) , and Tsim Sha Tsui ( 202 , 000 passengers per day ) had the highest passenger volumes 264 during the non - pandemic weekends . A significant correlation was observed between 265 passenger volume before and during the pandemic ( p < 0 . 001 ) , and also between weekdays 266 and weekends ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Hong Kong residents avoided going to public places with high 267 population density during the pandemic ( Fig . 3 ) . However , this intention gradually eroded as 268 the gradient of the red line decreasing from the first to the fourth shows . Some stations had 269 greater passenger flow on Sundays than on weekdays such as borders and amusement areas , 270 especially in the non - pandemic period ( green indicates where the percentage reduction is 271 below 0 ) . 16 272 273 Fig . 3 . Relationship between population flow and reduction rate of passenger volume at 95 274 MTR stations ( there are 95 circles in each colour ) during the four pandemic / non - pandemic 275 weekdays / Sunday . The percentage reduction is defined as the difference ratio of the subway 276 ridership number between the pandemic and non - pandemic weeks divided by that for the 277 non - pandemic week or the difference between Sundays and weekdays divided by that for 278 weekdays . A negative value means that the pandemic traffic is greater than non - pandemic 279 traffic .

During the 286 first pandemic week with the highest number of newly reported cases , traffic congestion 287 decreased by 95 . 0 % in Singapore , 91 . 6 % in Moscow , 91 . 3 % in New York , 91 . 3 % in Beijing , 288 90 . 3 % in Paris , 86 . 9 % in Wuhan , 79 . 3 % in Madrid , 75 . 5 % in London , 63 . 1 % in Los Angeles , 289 55 . 4 % in New Delhi , 40 . 7 % in Tokyo and 34 . 7 % in Hong Kong ( Fig . 4 ) . 290 291 292 Fig . 4 . Daily reported COVID - 19 cases and traffic congestion in 12 cities / territories . 293 294 Children and older people gradually returned to peak hour travel during the week , over 295 the four COVID - 19 waves ( Fig . 5A ) . Adults and students also relaxed their travel behaviour 296 during the last two waves compared with the first two waves . Children and students exhibited 297 a more relaxed travel behaviour over the weekends of the last two COVID - 19 waves . 298 We looked at 10 cities that experienced more than two COVID - 19 waves to analyse how 299 human travel behaviour changed over time . Residents in all these cities relaxed their travel 300 behaviour during subsequent waves of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission ( Fig . 5B ) . People 18 301 gradually reverted to normal local travel patterns at an average rate of 12 . 4 % per 100 days . 302 Interestingly , almost all cities showed a similar increased rate of change in congestion , when 303 compared to the same period in 2019 . In all studied cities , Beijing had the lowest travel 304 behaviour relaxation rate ( 0 . 09 % per day ) , while Singapore had the highest , at 0 . 37 % per day . 305 The delay from the peak of the COVID - 19 outbreak to the valley of population flow 306 using the MTR is not associated with the continuing COVID - 19 waves ( Figure . S3 ) , but 307 rather with the severity of the outbreak ( Fig . 5C ) . The more serious the outbreak , the shorter 308 the response time to changes in local travel patterns . Most people began limiting their local 309 travel 10 . 0 days after the most serious day of the outbreak , but this delay was reduced to 7 . 1 310 days if the outbreak was the most serious ever in that city ( Fig . 5C ) . Hong Kong had the 311 shortest delay in changes to local travel behaviour as a result of the severity of the outbreak , 312 indicating that Hong Kong residents are the most sensitive to the severity of the COVID - 19 313 transmission . 314 315 19 316 317 318 Fig . 5 .

Discussion 330 20 331 Travel behaviour is probably affected by both the prevalence of the disease , and its 332 severity . Many cities and countries restricted travel during the COVID - 19 pandemic 333 ( Shakibaei et al . , 2020 ) . Local travel may also reflect personal responses to disease 334 transmission . Hong Kong offers a good opportunity for study since local travel was not 335 restricted during the entire pandemic period . In this study , we analysed changes in local travel 336 behaviours during four consecutive COVID - 19 outbreaks in Hong Kong , using 4 billion 337 MTR smartcard use records from 1 January 2019 to 31 January 2021 ( 2019 for the control 338 group ) . 339 Residents in all countries reduced their local travel due to the COVID - 19 pandemic , and 340 the most prominent reduction in number of trips was in public transport ( Munawar et al . , 341 2021 ; Zang et al . , 2022 ; Hartleb et al . , 2022 ) . In Canadian cities , peak rush - hour congestion 342 decreased by 54 % to 75 % ( Tian et al . , 2021 ) . In Australia , the use of public transport dropped 343 by 80 % . In Chile , Peru , and Argentina , residents reduced their trips by more than 50 % 344 ( Andara et al . , 2021 ) . Sensitivity of local travel behaviour to the COVID - 19 pandemic was 345 also associated with population groups . Our study found that adults , children , students , and 346 older people on average reduced their MTR travel by 39 . 7 % , 80 . 1 % , 72 . 5 % , and 35 . 2 % 347 during the pandemic weeks . Based on a previous study , susceptibility to the virus of children , 348 students , adults , and older people was 0 . 23 : 0 . 23 : 0 . 64 : 1 ( Jing et al . , 2020 ) , which means that 349 students and children had the highest resistance to the virus , while older people had the 350 lowest resistance and the highest morbidity . Therefore , a sharp reduction in local travel by 351 older people would be a very efficient way to prevent and control COVID - 19 transmission . 352 Authorities should appeal to older people to reduce their travel during a pandemic . 21 353 In addition to population group , the type of destination also influences local travel 354 behaviour . We found that the population flow to workplace , school , shopping , amusement 355 and border areas decreased on average by 33 . 5 % , 41 . 9 % , 58 . 1 % , 85 . 4 % and 99 . 6 % 356 respectively , during the pandemic weeks . People reduced their travel to workplaces or 357 schools the least , possibly because most of these trips are mandatory . Many trips to shopping 358 and amusement areas are based on personal choice . Densely - populated indoor environments 359 such as shopping malls , restaurants , bars , and karaoke rooms posed high infection risk 360 because of poor ventilation and frequent close contact ( Zhang et al . , 2021a ; Chen et al . , 2020 ; 361 Gu et al . , 2021 ) . Considering these high - risk indoor environments , effective prevention and 362 control policies could include local governments closing subway stations near areas with 363 many restaurants and amusement areas . The sharp reduction in the number of people 364 traveling to these areas in Hong Kong show that residents exhibit good protective behaviour 365 with social distancing . Local travel to shopping areas went from 66 . 4 % in the first pandemic 366 week to 40 . 1 % during the third pandemic week , and from 89 . 0 % to 77 . 2 % for amusement 367 areas . 368 The particular day of the week ( weekday / weekend ) also influences local travel 369 behaviour . In Spain , residents reduced their local travel by 86 % on weekends , but only by 370 65 % on weekdays ( Saladie et al . , 2020 ) . Our study showed that Hong Kong residents on 371 average , also reduced their local travel via public transport more on Sundays ( 51 . 8 % ) than on 372 weekdays ( 41 . 3 % ) during the pandemic weeks , because few people are mandated to go to 373 work / school on Sundays . Residents should control their travel behaviour during both 374 weekdays and weekends . More schools and workplaces should encourage online courses and 22 375 work - at - home during a serious pandemic , and local governments could monitor the 376 effectiveness of such interventions using smartcard type data . 377 Due to the consecutive waves of COVID - 19 , people gradually relaxed their personal 378 protective behaviours . Pandemic fatigue is an expected and natural response to prolonged 379 public health crises ( WHO , 2020 ) . Between 1 . 5 % and 5 . 5 % fewer residents followed the 380 physical distancing policies over the four pandemic waves in Hong Kong ( Du et al . , 2021 ) , 381 however , our study showed that the relaxation in local travel behaviour by subway was much 382 greater . Some studies found that ridership on the subway system slowly increased after the 383 outbreak ( Lee et al . , 2020 ; Park , 2020 ) , but no studies have shown how travel behaviour 384 relaxed over the consecutive COVID - 19 waves . Based on the subway use data , our study also 385 showed a pandemic fatigue for Hong Kong residents . They reduced their subway use by 386 51 . 9 % during the first pandemic week , but only reduced it by 20 . 5 % during the fourth 387 pandemic week . Although the vaccination rate in many countries was high , and existing 388 COVID - 19 vaccines appear to be effective against SARS - CoV - 2 ( Chagla , 2021 ) , the efficacy 389 of current vaccines against newer variants is potentially low ( Mahase , 2021 ) . Relaxed local 390 travel behaviour reflected a relaxation in personal protective behaviour , and this trend may 391 increase the potential risk of infection in new waves of virus variants . Local travel behaviours 392 were also strongly influenced by non - pharmaceutical interventions such as stay - at - home 393 orders , regional lockdowns , and travel restrictions ( Beaute and Spiteri , 2020 ; Schlosser et al . , 394 2020 ; Bian et al . , 2021 ; Hensher et al . , 2021 ) , but many of these interventions were gradually 395 removed because of the negative economic impact . As a variant virus , the basic reproduction 396 number of omicron was estimated to be several times greater than that of the Delta variant 23 397 ( Davido et al . , 2022 ) , pandemic fatigue lead to a high infection risk when a virus variant with 398 high infectivity broke out in Hong Kong . Local governments should take adequate 399 countermeasures quantitatively that take into consideration the inclination toward pandemic 400 fatigue , especially for those areas with high pandemic fatigue scores such as workplaces and 401 schools . 402 Pandemic fatigue occurred not only in local travel behaviours , but also in most personal 403 protective behaviours . Americans avoiding small gatherings with family and friends fell from 404 71 % in May , to 45 % in September , 2020 ( Meichtry et al . , 2020 ) . College students in the 405 Philippines are experiencing physical and psychological discomfort and are beginning to 406 resist the lockdown after a long period of lockdown ( Labrague et al . 2020 ) . The elderly 407 cooperated with the quarantine measures for their own protection , while the younger 408 generation , who have not experienced health risks , have gradually stopped complying with 409 the quarantine measures , and report quarantine fatigue ( Franzen and Woehner , 2021 ) . 410 Pandemic fatigue is strongly associated with an understanding of the dangers of COVID - 19 , 411 and it was more common in young people and males during the pandemic ( MacIntyre et al . , 412 2021 ) . In China , we found that university students relaxed their protective behaviours of 413 hand - washing and mask - wearing after vaccination , but healthcare workers did not change 414 their personal protective behaviours . In Australia , UK , and USA , avoiding public areas 415 ( 80 . 4 % ) , hand hygiene ( 76 . 4 % ) , mask wearing ( 71 . 8 % ) , and social distancing ( 67 . 6 % ) were 416 the most common measures adopted during the COVID - 19 outbreak , however , following 417 these guidelines became less common from March to July 2020 ( MacIntyre et al . , 2021 ) . The 418 rate of decline in protective behaviour decelerated over time , with small rebounds seen in 24 419 later months ( Petherick et al . , 2021 ) . 420 This quantitative measure of pandemic fatigue could be used by local governments to 421 impose more informed interventions in the face of additional pandemic waves . For example , 422 they could determine how many workers need to work at home , how many students need to 423 study online , and what percentage of passengers need to wear masks when using public 424 transport . In addition , without considering pandemic fatigue , interventions in different 425 cities / countries could not be adopted because of different human behaviours . Through 426 quantitatively comparing pandemic fatigue in different cities / countries , interventions in other 427 territories could be adopted to Hong Kong , and help assess the effectiveness of each 428 intervention . 429 Pandemic fatigue has been studied by many researchers . Hong Kong has implemented 430 strict interventions to curb COVID - 19 pandemic since January 2020 , especially in four 431 pandemic waves . Around 6 . 60 % more people worry about being infected and 3 . 77 % of 432 people avoid social gatherings when 100 new confirmed cases was reported ( Du et al . , 2022 ) . 433 The fourth pandemic would lead to 14 % of the infected less if there is no pandemic fatigue 434 ( Du et al . , 2022 ) . A survey with more than 500 participants showed that one third of people 435 relaxed their personal protection after roughly one year since the COVID - 19 occurred 436 ( Haktanir et al . , 2022 ) . During the pandemic , many countries put forward different strict 437 interventions and achieved great progress . However , pandemic fatigue ultimately became the 438 key factor for the following outbreak ( Ala ' a et al . , 2021 ) . Therefore , relieving pandemic 439 fatigue plays an important role in preventing the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 , especially during 440 the late pandemic period . Governments should pay more attention to the biopsychosocial 25 441 nature of human beings when making interventions to prevent and control infectious disease 442 transmission . If governments want to control infectious disease transmission effectively , they 443 need to keep monitoring human behaviors on interventions ( e . g . mask wearing , social 444 distancing ) and emphasize the importance of interventions when pandemic fatigue was 445 observed . Especially when a new outbreak is coming , the government should remind all 446 residents paying more attention to their personal protection than last time . 447 There were some limitations in this study . The accuracy and reliability of the results 448 would be influenced by following situations : ( 1 ) Aall Hong Kong residents were divided into 449 four groups : adult , child , student and senior . However , some seniors , children , and students 450 use non - discount cards ( e . g . adult ) , which may introduce some error into our analyses ; . ( 2 ) 451 Second , these four pandemic weeks and the non - pandemic weeks may not be completely 452 representative of the pandemic and non - pandemic periods ; . ( 3 ) In addition , that that one 453 week was considered to be the length of each wave may also introduce some errors . Due to 454 different cultures , human travel behaviours , and urban public transports design , the results 455 may not represent the characteristics of other cities . However , an accurate result which is 456 suitable for other cities could be generated using their local smartcard data . Pandemic fatigue 457 is influenced by many factors , such as local policies ( Table S3 ) for COVID - 19 prevention 458 and control , and the number of mild cases and asymptomatic cases , which cannot be 459 completely excluded . These all could introduce some errors . Finally , although the reduction 460 in subway ridership due to the social movement in October 2019 had riding almost 461 disappeared by December 2019 , a little error may exist when calculating pandemic fatigue for 462 the Week 3 ( 4 to 10 December , 2019 ) control group . 26 463 464 5 . Conclusion 465 466 Adults , children , students , and older people on average reduced their subway travel by 467 39 . 7 % , 80 . 1 % , 72 . 5 % , and 35 . 2 % respectively , during the four pandemic weeks . The 468 population reduced their travel to the amusement area ( 85 . 4 % ) and border area ( 99 . 6 % ) the 469 most , and to residential ( 30 . 3 % ) and workplace ( 33 . 5 % ) the least during four pandemic 470 weeks . People gradually reverted to their normal travel behaviour at an average rate of 471 0 . 124 % per day . Relaxed human travel behaviour reflected their protective behaviour during 472 the COVID - 19 pandemic , which very likely resulted in an increase in the infection risk 473 during subsequent waves of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , especially for the more infectious 474 variants such as the delta variant . 475 476 Declaration of interests 477 478 The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal 479 relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper . 480 481 Acknowledgements 482 483 This work is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China , grant number 484 52108067 , COVID - 19 Action Seed Funding , HKU ( 176FRCKCHE , 177DRCKCHE ) , 27 485 Innovation Wing Two Research Fund ( 000200000 . 000000 . 14200 . 100 . 01 ) , and a 486 Collaborative Research Fund ( grant number C7025 - 16G ) provided by the Research Grants 487 Council of Hong Kong .
