Introduction The protrusion of lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia is signalled via the Rho family small G - proteins , Rac and Cdc42 , respectively ( Machesky and Hall , 1997 ; Nobes and Hall , 1995 ; Ridley , 2001 ) . Insight into the players downstream of Rac and Cdc42 involved in mediating protrusion is now beginning to emerge from collected information on protein complexes inﬂuencing actin polymerisation in vitro ( Higgs and Pollard , 2001 ; Pantaloni et al . , 2001 ) and on the molecular determinants of actin - based pathogen motility ( Frischknecht and Way , 2001 ; Pantaloni et al . , 2001 ) , as well as on localisations of proteins in lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia in living cells ( Small et al . , 2002 ) . An understanding of the regulation of actin dynamics during cell motility requires characterisation of the complexes of proteins involved at sites of actin nucleation and turnover . Particularly relevant to the present report is the ﬁnding that several candidate proteins implicated in actin polymerisation dynamics in vitro are speciﬁcally recruited to the tips of lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia , where actin polymerisation for protrusion is initiated and controlled . These proteins include WAVE , a submember of the Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein ( WASP ) family ( Hahne et al . , 2001 ; Nakagawa et al . , 2001 ) , VASP / Mena family members ( Rottner et al . , 1999 ; Bear et al . , 2000 ) and proﬁlin ( Geese et al . , 2000 ) . Ena / VASP family proteins , including Mena , localise to the tips of lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia ( Lanier et al . , 1999 ; Nakagawa et al . , 2001 ; Rottner et al . , 1999a ; Rottner et al . , 2001 ) , as well as to the head of the actin comet tail of Listeria monocytogenes in infected cytoplasm ( Laurent et al . , 1999 ) , and are thought to participate in the regulation of actin ﬁlament dynamics ( Bear et al . , 2000 ; Bear et al . , 2002 ; Gertler et al . , 1996 ; Loisel et al . , 1999 ; Rottner et al . , 1999a ) . The WASP - related , WAVE / Scar family is represented by three isoforms in human tissues , WAVE1 - WAVE3 ( Suetsugu et al . , 1999 ) . All isoforms share a C - terminal acidic region that stimulates the actin ﬁlament nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ; Miki et al . , 2000 ) , and the conserved N - terminal WAVE / Scar homology domain ( WHD ) possesses lamellipodia localisation activity ( Nakagawa et al . , 2001 ; Nozumi et al . , 2003 ) . Proﬁlin provides monomeric actin molecules to the elongating actin ﬁlaments near the cell membrane ( reviewed by Miller , 2002 ) . 2577 The insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 ( IRSp53 ) links Rac and WAVE2 and has been implicated in lamellipodia protrusion . Recently , however , IRSp53 has been reported to bind to both Cdc42 and Mena to induce ﬁlopodia . To shed independent light on IRSp53 function we determined the localisations and dynamics of IRSp53 and WAVE2 in B16 melanoma cells . In cells spread well on a laminin substrate , IRSp53 was localised by antibody labelling at the tips of both lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia . The same localisation was observed in living cells with IRSp53 tagged with enhanced green ﬂorescence protein ( EGFP - IRSp53 ) , but only during protrusion . From the transfection of deletion mutants the N - terminal region of IRSp53 , which binds active Rac , was shown to be responsible for its localisation . Although IRSp53 has been reported to regulate ﬁlopodia formation with Mena , EGFP - IRSp53 showed the same localisation in MV D7 Ena / VASP ( vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein ) family deﬁcient cells . WAVE2 tagged with DsRed1 colocalised with EGFP - IRSp53 at the tips of protruding lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia and , in double - transfected cells , the IRSp53 signal in ﬁlopodia decreased before that of WAVE2 during retraction . These results suggest an alternative modulatory role for IRSp53 in the extension of both ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia , through WAVE2 .

IRSp53 was originally identiﬁed as the substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase , although a corresponding function remains outstanding ( Yeh et al . , 1996 ) . Miki et al . ( Miki et al . , 2000 ) found that IRSp53 linked Rac to WAVE2 , the ubiquitous member of the WAVE family ( Suetsugu et al . , 1999 ) . IRSp53 binds to Rac through its N - terminal region named the Rac binding region ( RCB ) ( Miki et al . , 2000 ; Miki and Takenawa , 2002 ) . In a later study , Govind et al . ( Govind et al . , 2001 ) reported that IRS - 58 , a C - terminal alternative splicing variant of IRSp53 ( Alvarez et al . , 2002 ) , bound to Cdc42 at its centre part . Furthermore , Krugmann et al . ( Krugmann et al . , 2001 ) identiﬁed IRSp53 as a Rac and Cdc42 binding protein using the yeast two - hybrid method . They deﬁned the Cdc42 binding region as that containing a partial CRIB motif ( Cdc42 and Rac binding motif ) ( reviewed by Hoffman and Cerione , 2000 ) at the same position as reported by Govind et al . ( Govind et al . , 2001 ) . IRSp53 binds to the proline - rich regions of both WAVE2 and Mena through its SH3 domain ( Krugmann et al . , 2001 ; Miki et al . , 2000 ) . From their recent studies , Krugmann et al . ( Krugmann et al . , 2001 ) concluded that IRSp53 acts synergistically with Mena in ﬁlopodia induction , rather than as a link between Rac and WAVE 2 in signalling lamellipodia formation ( Miki et al . , 2000 ) . IRSp53 has thus been attributed with apparently alternative roles in the formation of either lamellipodia or ﬁlopodia . To gain more insight into IRSp53 function , we investigated the localisation and dynamics of IRSp53 and its target proteins in living cells . Materials and Methods Expression contracts and transfection pEGFP - C1 , - N1 and pDsRed1 - N1 were purchased from Clontech ( Palo Alto , CA ) . cDNA of full - length IRSp53 was inserted into the Bam HI site of pEGFP - C1 . The central region of IRSp53 [ CNT ; 230 to 364 amino acids ( aa ) ] was ampliﬁed by PCR and inserted into the Bam H1 site of pEGFP - N1 . A cDNA fragment encoding the Rac binding ( RCB ; 1 to 229 aa ) region was cut out from pEGFP - IRSp53 by Sac I and Stu I , and inserted between the Sac I and Sma I sites of pEGFP - C1 . WAVE2 cDNA lacking the stop codon was ampliﬁed by PCR and inserted between Xho I and Age I sites of pDsRed1 - N1 . IRSp53 , SH3 and RCB tagged with myc were as reported previously ( Miki et al . , 2000 ; Miki and Takenawa , 2002 ) . These constructs were transfected with SuperFect ( QIAGEN K . K . , Tokyo , Japan ) according to the manufacturer’s guide . Antibodies and immunoﬂuorescence microscopy Affinity puriﬁed polyclonal antibodies against WAVE were characterised as described previously ( Miki et al . , 1998b ; Nakagawa et al . , 2001 ) . Rabbit aniserum against green ﬂuorescence protein was purchased from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ) . Monoclonal antibody against myc - tag ( clone no . 9E10 ) , FITC - conjugated anti - mouse immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) goat IgG and rhodamine - phalloidin were obtained from Sigma - Aldrich Japan K . K . ( Tokyo , Japan ) . The immunoﬂuorescence microscopy was performed using a confocal laser scaning microscope ( LSM510 , Zeiss , Japan ) as previously described ( Nakagawa et al . , 2001 ) . The pinhole of LSM510 was set to adjust the thickness of focal planes at 0 . 7 m m for immunoﬂuorescence microscopy . Video microscopy of living cells Transfected cells cultured on laminin - coated cover glass were mounted in an open heating chamber ( Warner Instruments , Hamden , CT ) operating at 32°C and 37°C for MV D7 cells and B16 cells , respectively . The treatment with aluminium ﬂuoride was carried out according to the method of Hahne et al . ( Hahne et al . , 2001 ) . The chamber was mounted on an inverted microscope ( Axiovert S100TV , Zeiss , Austria ) equipped for epiﬂuorescence and phase contrast microscopy . Data were acquired with a back - illuminated CCD camera ( Roper Scientiﬁc , Trenton , NJ ) . The interval time between video frames was set at 7 seconds ( Supplemental movie ) or 17 seconds . For the double transfections of EGFP - tagged IRSp53 and DsRed1 - tagged WAVE2 , the time between sequential frames in the two ﬂuorescent channels was 1 . 5 seconds . Measurement of ﬂuorescence intensity The ﬂuorescence intensity of the tips of ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia were measured using Scion Image 1 . 62c ( Scion Corporation , Frederick , MD ) . The ﬂuorescence intensity proﬁles were obtained within a frame of 0 . 5 m m width along ﬁlopodia or of 1 m m width across lamellipodia . The speciﬁc ﬂuorescence at the tip was obtained by subtracting the mean background ﬂuorescence on both sides of the tip ( see Fig . 7d ) . Results IRSp53 is recruited to the tips of protruding lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia through its N - terminal region To establish IRSp53 localisation , we ﬁrst transfected B16 melanoma cells with myc - tagged IRSp53 ( myc - IRSp53 ) , which preserves the binding activity to Cdc42 , Rac , Mena and WAVE2 ( Krugmann et al . , 2001 ; Miki et al . , 2000 ) and employed immunoﬂuorescence ( Fig . 1a - d ) and confocal microscopy . Highly expressing cells formed many branched extensions without clear localisation of myc - IRSp53 , as previously reported ( Fig . 1a , b , arrowheads ) ( Govind et al . , Journal of Cell Science 116 ( 12 ) Fig . 1 . Localisation of IRSp53 in B16 melanoma cells .

Double - arrowheads point to the non - lamellipodium cell membrane . Bars , 10 m m . 2579 IRSp53 dynamics with WAVE2 2001 ; Krugmann et al . , 2001 ) . However , cells expressing moderate levels of myc - IRSp53 extended lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia normally . As shown in Fig . 1c , d , IRSp53 was then more concentrated towards the tip of the actin meshwork in lamellipodia and was present at the tips of ﬁlopodia . To analyse how the localisation of IRSp53 was related to cell movement , we observed the dynamics of IRSp53 tagged with EGFP ( EGFP - IRSp53 ) in living B16 cells . In general , transfected cells were reluctant to spread , so cells were cotransfected with dominant active Rac1 ( Rac1V12 ) to promote cell spreading . As shown in Fig . 2a - d , EGFP - IRSp53 was concentrated at the lamellipodium tip similar to myc - IRSp53 . In cell edges undergoing retraction , EGFP - IRSp53 was absent but relocated to the tips following extension of lamellipodia ( Fig . 2c , d , white lines ) , as formerly found for other tip proteins ( Geese et al . , 2000 ; Hahne et al . , 2001 ; Rottner et al . , 1999a ; Stradal et al . , 2001 ) . The same dynamics of IRSp53 were observed in B16 cells stimulated with aluminium ﬂuoride ( Fig . 2e , f ) . In these cells , EGFP - IRSp53 localised at the protruding tips of lamellipodia and was absent from retracting tips , as well as from retraction ﬁbres ( Fig . 2e , f , arrowheads ) . EGFP - IRSp53 was retained in membrane ruffles at the edge of Rac1V12 cotransfected cells ( Fig . 2c , d ) , as also earlier observed with EGFP - VASP ( Rottner et al . , 1999a ) , and was also concentrated at the tips of elongating ﬁlopodia ( Fig . 6 ; Supplemental movie ) . These observations suggest that IRSp53 could function downstream of both Rac and Cdc42 . The localisation of EGFP - IRSp53 in living cells was consistent with the immunoﬂuorescence localisation of myc - IRSp53 . IRSp53 binds to both Rac and Cdc42 through its RCB region and CRIB motif , respectively , ( Govind et al . , 2001 ; Krugmann et al . , 2001 ; Miki et al . , 2000 ; Miki and Takenawa , 2002 ) . The SH3 domain of IRSp53 is reported to interact with WAVE2 and Mena to form lamellipodia and / or ﬁlopodia ( Krugmann et al . , 2001 ; Miki et al . , 2000 ) . To clarify which regions of IRSp53 regulate its localisation , we expressed deletion constructs of IRSp53 in B16 melanoma cells tagged with myc , which does not affect the interaction with Rac ( Miki et al . , 2000 ) . myc – D SH3 and myc - RCB fragments showed the same localisation as the full - length IRSp53 , but the SH3 domain Fig . 2 .

Arrows and arrowheads indicate the tips of ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia , respectively . Bars , 10 m m . 2580 alone ( myc - SH3 ) failed to localise ( Fig . 3d , e ) . These results indicate that the localisation of IRSp53 could be regulated independently from the interaction with WAVE2 and / or Mena , which are both mediated by the SH3 domain . They also suggest that the N - terminal sequence in the RCB region could tether IRSp53 to the tips of both lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia IRSp53 is localised at the tips of lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia protruding from Mena / VASP double - knockout cells Because overexpression of IRSp53 induced ﬁlopodial extensions , it was suggested that the complex of IRSp53 and Mena regulates ﬁlopodia elongation ( Krugmann et al . , 2001 ) . This conclusion is inconsistent , however , with the recruitment of both IRSp53 ( Figs 1 , 2 ) and Mena ( Gerlter et al . , 1996 ; Nakagawa et al . , 2001 ; Rottner et al . , 1999a ; Rottner et al . , 2001 ) to lamellipodia , as well as ﬁlopodia . To provide further insight into the in vivo relationship between IRSp53 and Mena , we analysed the localisation of EGFP - IRSp53 in MV D7 , Ena / VASP family deﬁcient cells ( Bear et al . , 2000 ) . When cotransfected with Rac1V12 and EGFP - IRSp53 , MV D7 cells plated on laminin extended lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia with EGFP - IRSp53 localised to their tips ( Fig . 4 ) . This result showed that the IRSp53 : Mena complex is not essential for ﬁlopodia elongation , and that IRSp53 may interact with WAVE2 rather than with Mena at these tips . WAVE2 , but not WAVE1 , localises to ﬁlopodia tips with IRSp53 Signiﬁcantly , IRSp53 binds only WAVE2 of the three WAVE isoforms and speciﬁcally enhances WAVE2 activity to induce Arp2 / 3 complex activation ( Miki et al , 2000 ) . These results suggested that WAVE2 might be localised at the tips of both lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia , together with IRSp53 . To investigate this possibility , we determined the localisation of WAVE2 and compared its dynamics with that of IRSp53 in B16 cells . Before the living cell observation , we localised endogenous WAVE in B16 cell using an anti - WAVE antibody that recognises all three WAVE isoforms . The antibody labelled the tips of both lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia ( Fig . 5a , b ) , in contrast to WAVE1 , which localises only at the lamellipodium tip ( Hahne et al . , 2001 ) when expressed in B16 cells . In the neural growth cone , WAVE2 and 3 localise to both tips of lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia but only WAVE1 localises to the lamellipodium tip ( Nozumi et al . , 2003 ) . Because WAVE1 and 3 are expressed mainly in neural tissues ( Suetsugu et al . , 1999 ; Benachenhou et al . , 2002 ) , the tip label observed by antibody labelling in untransfected B16 cells is most likely to be attributed to the ubiquitously expressing WAVE2 isoform . The localisation of DsRed1 - tagged WAVE2 ( WAVE2 - DsRed ) conﬁrmed this possibility ( Fig . 5c , d ) . WAVE2 - DsRed - transfected B16 cells were stimulated with aluminium ﬂuoride to enhance lamellipodia formation ( Hahne et al . , 2001 ) . As shown in Fig . 5c , d , WAVE2 - DsRed localised to the edge of extending lamellipodium and the tips of ﬁlopodia similar to the immunolabelling with anti - WAVE antibody .

Bars , 10 m m . 2581 IRSp53 dynamics with WAVE2 same cell , we could compare the dynamics of these two proteins . B16 cells were cotransfected with EGFP - IRSp53 and WAVE2 - DsRed and were microinjected with constitutively active Rac1L61 to promote cell spreading ( Fig . 6 ) . Consistent with the single label experiments , EGFP - IRSp53 and WAVE2 - DsRed were colocalised at the tips of lamellipodia . The ﬂuorescence intensity of EGFP - IRSp53 at the ﬁlopodium tip was decreased concomitant with retraction , whereas WAVE2 - DsRed was retained at the tip during the early retraction phase ( see ﬂuorescent intensity proﬁles in Fig . 6 ) . As shown in the bottom frame of Fig . 6 , when the ﬁlopodium was fully retracted , the ﬂuorescence intensity of both EGFP and DsRed at the tip was decreased to the same level . To analyse the difference of EGFP - IRSp53 and WAVE2 - DsRed dynamics at the ﬁlopodia tips , we measured their ﬂuorescence intensities during retraction . Because the expression time course was different between EGFP and DsRed1 vectors , it was difficult to ﬁnd cells with moderate ﬂuorescence of both EGFP and DsRed1 . Fig . 6 shows an example of three ﬁlopodia whose tips could be traced over at least six video frames ( 35 seconds ) sequentially before disappearing in lamellipodia . These ﬁlopodia elongated at a rate of 0 . 19 – 0 . 01 m m / min and retracted at a rate of 0 . 09 – 0 . 07 m m / min . The ﬂuorescence intensity of EGFP - IRSp53 decreased to nearly half ( I R = 45 . 2 – 11 . 3 % ) within 35 seconds , whereas that of WAVE2 - DsRed was preserved ( I R = 88 . 1 – 11 . 2 % ) in this period . The ﬂuorescence at lamellipodia edges in the same video frames did not change in the same period ; the I R values of EGFP - IRSp53 and WAVE2 - DsRed were 85 – 16 . 3 % and 95 . 6 – 18 . 1 % , respectively . To compensate for photobleaching , we estimated the ratios between the I R of ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia . The ratios of EGFP - IRSp53 and WAVE2 - DsRed were 53 % and 92 % , respectively . EGFP - IRSp53 and WAVE2 - DsRed showed essentially the same dynamics in other ﬁlopodia . These results suggest that EGFP - IRSp53 delocalises from the ﬁlopodia tip before WAVE2 - DsRed , during retraction . Discussion Although Krugmann et al . ( Krugmann et al . , 2001 ) reported that IRSp53 bound to Rac and WAVE2 in addition to Cdc42 and Mena , they concluded that IRSp53 regulated ﬁlopodia formation as its overexpression induced ﬁlopodia . Likewise , Govind et al . ( Govind et al . , 2001 ) showed that the overexpression of IRS - 58 , a C - terminal alternative splicing variant of IRSp53 ( Alvarez et al . , 2002 ) , induced ﬁlopodia formation in various cell lines . They observed that endogenous IRS - 58 was generally localised in ﬁlopodia . We also observed that the overexpression of myc - IRSp53 in B16 cells induced long , multibranched ﬁlopodia . Considering that B16 cells express endogenous IRSp53 ( H . N . and J . V . S . , unpublished ) , our result suggests that IRSp53 normally localises to the tips of both lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia . Because the cotransfection of Rac1V12 recovered lamellipodium formation of B16 cells on laminin substrata , the predominance of ﬁlopodia - like projections in cells overexpressing IRSp53 or the RCB region may be due to the sequestration of Rac by IRSp53 at high expression levels , leading to Rac inhibition . The observation of Krugmann et al . ( Krugmann et al . , 2001 ) that the overexpression of IRSp53 induced the atypical retraction of cell edges , and is dependent on incubation time , is consistent with the onset of deleterious effects at high expression levels . We show here that the N - terminal RCB region of IRSp53 is recruited to the tips of both lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia , whereas the central region including the CRIB motif is not responsible for the localisation . Although this N - terminal region has been reported to be essential for Rac binding ( Miki et al . , 2000 ; Miki and Takenawa , 2002 ) , it also Fig . 6 .

See supplementary video . 2582 recruits IRSp53 to the tips of ﬁlopodia , suggesting the involvement of other adaptors determining ﬁlopodia localisation . Alternatively , localisation in ﬁlopodia could reﬂect the derivation of ﬁlopodia from lamellipodia networks signalled via Rac ( see Small et al . , 2002 ) . Further exploration of proteins interacting with the IRSp53 N - terminal region should provide information about the additional adaptors or complexes involved . We show here that IRSp53 colocalises with WAVE2 at the tips of both protruding lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia , independently of Mena . From these results we propose a schematic model of IRSp53 function ( Fig . 7 ) that could explain the two different models of its role in cell movement ( Govind et al . , 2001 ; Krugmann et al . , 2001 ; Miki et al . , 2000 ) . Like WAVE1 , WAVE2 is recruited to the tips of both lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia through its WHD domain ( Nakagawa et al . , 2001 ; Nozumi et al . , 2003 ) . Mena localisation is regulated synergistically through both the EVH ( Ena VASP homology ) 1 and EVH2 domains ( Bear et al . , 2002 ) . Considering the binding of IRSp53 with both WAVE2 and Mena through its SH3 domain ( Fig . 7 , solid double - ended arrows ) and their colocalisation at the tips of lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia , IRSp53 could tie WAVE2 and Mena into a complex . This complex could contribute to the regulation of actin polymerisation at the cell membrane , in an alternative pathway , analogous to the complex of ActA and VASP at the surface of L . monocytogenes ( Lanier et al . , 1999 ) . As previously reported ( Miki et al . , 2000 ) , IRSp53 should also enhance WAVE2 activity to promote Arp2 / 3 complex - induced actin ﬁlament polymerisation in lamellipodia ( Fig . 7 , solid arrow ) . Because the Arp2 / 3 complex is absent from ﬁlopodia ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) , WAVE2 may regulate actin polymerisation there through the recruitment of actin molecules to ﬁlopodia tips by the interaction of its proline - rich region with proﬁlactin ( Miki et al . , 1998b ) . IRSp53 localisation is not dependent on WAVE2 or Mena . This is indicated by the observation that IRSp53 disappeared from the ﬁlopodia tips before WAVE2 ( Fig . 6 ) and by the peripheral tip localisation of IRSp53 in the absence of Mena . Therefore , IRSp53 may be involved in recruiting WAVE2 and Mena in lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia via Rac and Cdc42 , respectively . The localisation of Ena / VASP family proteins to the lamellipodium tip is highly correlated with the protrusion rate ( Rottner et al . , 1999a ) , but the roles of these proteins are still controversial ( Arguinzonis et al . , 2002 ; Bear et al . , 2000 ; Bear et al . , 2002 ; Nakagawa et al . , 2001 ; Rottner et al . , 1999a ) . It remains to be shown whether the interaction of IRSp53 with Mena inﬂuences actin polymerisation dynamics , either in vitro or in vivo . Although N - WASP plays an important role in Cdc42 - induced ﬁlopodia elongation ( Miki et al . , 1998 ; Suetsugu et al . , 1998 ) , ﬁlopodia can also be induced in N - WASP - deﬁcient ﬁbroblastic cells ( Lommel et al . , 2001 ; Snapper et al . , 2001 ) . These results suggest that , in the process of ﬁlopodia formation , N - WASP functions as a modulator of actin cytoskeleton reorganisation , but is not essential . From our present observation , WAVE2 represents an alternative regulator of actin polymerisation in ﬁlopodia . Recent studies have shown that WAVE1 exists in an inactive form in a heterotetrameric protein complex , and becomes accessible to Rac activation in the presence of Nck , whereby both Rac and Nck become involved in complex disassembly ( Eden et al . , 2002 ; Takenawa and Miki , 2001 ; Westphal et al . , 2002 ) . Because neither Nck nor Rac are present at lamelliopodia tips , this activation may precede the engagement of WAVE with IRSp53 . Further analysis of the temporal localisation of WAVE - interacting proteins should shed light on the differential regulation of lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia protrusion .

Mena is recruited to the protruding tips of both lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia through the synergetic function of its EVH1 and EVH2 domains . WAVE2 is recruited to the tips through the WHD domain . IRSp53 binding to the proline - rich region of WAVE2 enhances the activity of WAVE2 to stimulate the Arp2 / 3 complex . Because IRSp53 also binds to the proline - rich region of Mena , IRSp53 may tie WAVE2 and Mena into a complex . The shaded boxes show the proline - rich regions . Double - ended solid arrows between molecules indicate the previously reported interactions . Grey arrows show the tethering activity to the tips of both lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia .
