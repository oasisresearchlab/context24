Received : 2020 . 12 . 24 ; Accepted : 2021 . 02 . 08 ; Published : 2021 . 03 . 13 Abstract Background : The non - homogenous distribution of antibody - drug conjugates ( ADCs ) within solid tumors is a major limiting factor for their wide clinical application . Nanobodies have been shown to rapidly penetrate into xenografts , achieving more homogeneous tumor targeting . However , their rapid renal clearance can hamper their application as nanobody drug conjugates ( NDCs ) . Here , we evaluate whether half - life extension via non - covalent interaction with albumin can benefit the efficacy of a HER2 - targeted NDC . Methods : HER2 - targeted nanobody 11A4 and the irrelevant nanobody R2 were genetically fused to an albumin - binding domain ( ABD ) at their C - terminus . Binding to both albumin and tumor cells was determined by ELISA - based assays . The internalization potential as well as the in vitro efficacy of NDCs were tested on HER2 expressing cells . Serum half - life of iodinated R2 and R2 - ABD was studied in tumor - free mice . The distribution of fluorescently labelled 11A4 and 11A4 - ABD was assessed in vitro in 3D spheroids . Subsequently , the in vivo distribution was evaluated by optical molecular imaging and ex vivo by tissue biodistribution and tumor immunohistochemical analysis after intravenous injection of IRDye800 - conjugated nanobodies in mice bearing HER2 - positive subcutaneous xenografts . Finally , efficacy studies were performed in HER2 - positive NCI - N87 xenograft - bearing mice intravenously injected with a single dose ( 250 nmol / kg ) of nanobodies conjugated to auristatin F ( AF ) either via a maleimide or the organic Pt ( II ) - based linker , coined L x ® . Results : 11A4 - ABD was able to bind albumin and HER2 and was internalized by HER2 expressing cells , irrespective of albumin presence . Interaction with albumin did not alter its distribution through 3D spheroids . Fusion to ABD resulted in a 14 . 8 - fold increase in the serum half - life , as illustrated with the irrelevant nanobody . Furthermore , ABD fusion prolonged the accumulation of 11A4 - ABD in HER2 - expressing xenografts without affecting the expected homogenous intratumoral distribution . Next to that , reduced kidney retention of ABD - fused nanobodies was observed . Finally , a single dose administration of either 11A4 - ABD - maleimide - AF or 11A4 - ABD - Lx - AF led to long - lasting tumor remission in HER2 - positive NCI - N87 xenograft - bearing mice . Conclusion : Our results demonstrate that genetic fusion of a nanobody to ABD can significantly extend serum half - life , resulting in prolonged and homogenous tumor accumulation . Most importantly , as supported by the impressive anti - tumor efficacy observed after a single dose administration of 11A4 - ABD - AF , our data reveal that monovalent internalizing ABD - fused nanobodies have potential for the development of highly effective NDCs .

This cancer cell - specific delivery of the linked cytotoxic drug allows for lower minimum effective doses . Furthermore , the systemic toxicity such a drug could cause if administered alone is alleviated , enabling for higher maximum tolerated doses ( MTD ) and overall wider therapeutic windows [ 2 ] . Several aspects regarding the design of ADCs can influence their antitumor efficacy . Besides the choice of antigen target for the mAb part of an ADC [ 3 ] , the design of linkers and the optimization of conjugation strategies , as well as the available cytotoxic drugs are critical considerations being greatly explored , especially for ADCs targeting solid tumors [ 2 ] . To date , two out of the nine clinically approved ADCs are used for the treatment of HER2 expressing solid tumors [ 4 ] . Both , Kadcyla ® ( Trastuzumab emtansine or T - DM1 ) and Enhertu ® ( Trastuzumab deruxtecan ) consist of the humanized HER2 - targeted mAb trastuzumab , while employing two different types of linkers , i . e . a non - cleavable linker for Kadcyla and an enzymatically cleavable linker for Enhertu [ 5 , 6 ] . Next to the different linker technologies , the drug payloads used are displaying distinct modes of action . DM1 used in Kadcyla is a tubulin polymerization inhibitor , like the majority of drug payloads used in ADC clinical trials [ 4 ] . It has been shown that after lysosomal degradation , the released Lys - SMCC - DM1 cannot passively diffuse through the plasma membrane to the tumor microenvironment [ 7 ] , a common characteristic of hydrophilic drug payloads that are therefore unable to kill neighboring cells through a bystander mechanism [ 8 ] . On the other hand , drugs , such as Enhertu’s topoisomerase I inhibitor deruxtecan , demonstrating high membrane permeability could result in cytotoxicity against neighboring ( tumor ) cells that are not directly targeted by the ADC , conferring bystander cell killing effect . However , the same mechanism might also contribute to decreased tolerability and lower MTD . Differences in the in vivo efficacy and tolerability of these HER2 - targeted ADCs can therefore be attributed to different payloads as well as to different linker types used . Another major aspect greatly affecting the efficacy of ADCs is their heterogeneous intra - tumoral distribution [ 9 ] . Besides tumor microenvironment characteristics [ 10 ] , vascularization [ 11 ] , antigen expression [ 12 ] and clearance rates [ 13 ] , the physicochemical mAb characteristics , like size and high binding affinities [ 14 , 15 ] , can also result in slow tumor penetration . Often , mAb distribution is restricted to a few cell layers surrounding blood vessels ( resulting in the ‘binding site - barrier effect’ ) and it is generally poor at hypoxic areas of tumors , resulting in suboptimal drug delivery [ 16 – 18 ] . Intra - tumoral distribution is also mAb dose dependent , meaning that ADCs to be used at a low MTD will be prone to heterogenous distribution . Especially for ADCs conjugated to non - bystander drugs and / or ADCs that have to be used at low MTD , improvements in intra - tumoral distribution are important for increasing their in vivo efficacy [ 19 ] . Ideally , what needs to be achieved is the delivery of a certain amount of payload per cell throughout the tumor , sufficient for killing each individual cell [ 20 , 21 ] . Antibody fragments of smaller molecular weight , resulting in higher diffusivity [ 14 , 22 ] and vascular permeability [ 23 ] , have been shown to demonstrate more homogeneous tissue distribution over mAbs [ 14 , 24 – 26 ] . Over the past years , especially after the FDA approval of caplacizumab [ 27 ] , nanobodies ( registered trademark of Ablynx ) , also known as single - domain antibodies ( sdAb ) , have been receiving growing attention [ 28 , 29 ] . Nanobodies constitute the antigen - binding domain of the heavy - chain only antibodies first identified in members of the Camelidae family almost 30 years ago [ 30 ] . In contrast to other small ( artificial ) antibody fragments , nanobodies have the advantage of being derived from naturally binding affinity - matured libraries following immunization and they demonstrate excellent solubility and thermostability [ 31 ] . Conjugation of nanobodies to radio - isotopes or fluorescent dyes has already led to promising diagnostic imaging and tumor therapeutic applications in pre - clinical , but also clinical set - ups [ 25 , 31 – 35 ] . A major limitation arising when nanobodies are intended to be used as cytotoxic drug carriers in the form of nanobody - drug conjugates ( NDCs ) is their short presence in the circulation , as a result of fast renal clearance . The use of albumin and albumin - interacting moieties , due to the direct size increase above the renal filtration threshold ( ~ 40 - 50 kDa , 2 - 6 nm ) and because it allows for neonatal Fc receptor ( FcRn ) - mediated recycling , results in in vivo half - life extension of small biotherapeutics and has been widely used in the clinic [ 36 , 37 ] . To minimally affect the exceptional tissue distribution of nanobodies , non - covalent interaction with albumin , by fusion to albumin binding peptides [ 36 ] or albumin binding domains ( ABD ) [ 38 , 39 ] , could be an effective approach to extent their half - life . Theranostics 2021 , Vol . 11 , Issue 11 http : / / www . thno . org 5527 Another challenge in NDC development and production is related to solubility issues , taking into account that sometimes hydrophobic drugs have to be coupled to the small - sized hydrophilic nanobodies in a stable and inert way . For this purpose , the cationic metal - organic Pt ( II ) - based linker , [ ethylenediamine - platinum ( II ) ] 2 + , coined “L x ” ® , has shown great promise [ 40 , 41 ] . Lx - technology comprises a two - step approach . In the first step ( “complexation” ) , the drug is coupled to the precursor complex L x I 2 . These storable “semi - final” products contain a positively charged Pt ( II ) center , which increases the water solubility of drug - linker moieties compared to analogous non - Lx containing constructs . In the second step , these drug - linker moieties can be conjugated either to histidine residues of unmodified intact mAbs in a site - restricted way ( meaning that conjugation occurs preferentially to the Fc domain ) [ 42 ] , or to cysteine residues [ 43 ] that can be engineered at the C - terminus of nanobodies for site - specific coupling . In the present study , we evaluated the previously characterized HER2 - targeted nanobody 11A4 [ 44 ] genetically fused to an ABD [ 39 , 45 ] as a potential targeting moiety for developing NDCs . When targeting HER2 , the rapid recycling of the receptor [ 46 , 47 ] could negatively affect the cytoplasmic concentration of the released drug , influencing NDC efficacy . Despite the fact that receptor clustering using biparatopic antibodies or nanobodies has been shown to increase endocytosis and lysosomal trafficking [ 7 , 34 , 48 ] , comparative in vivo imaging studies using mono - as well as multi - valent nanobody formats suggested an advantage for monovalent constructs with respect to distribution and cell targeting [ 21 , 49 , 50 ] . Therefore , the monovalent 11A4 - ABD was chosen for coupling the highly potent microtubule stabilizing drug auristatin F ( AF ) . AF was coupled either via common maleimide - thiol conjugation or using the platinum - based Lx linker technology [ 40 ] , to allow the comparison between these conjugation technologies for NDC applications . The distribution of both 11A4 and 11A4 - ABD was assessed in vitro in 3D spheroids and in vivo in a HER2 - positive and negative subcutaneous breast cancer model in mice . The in vivo efficacy of the NDCs was evaluated in mice bearing xenografts of HER2 overexpressing cells . Our data confirm that half - life extension of monovalent nanobodies can result in increased homogenous tumor accumulation , significantly enhancing the in vivo efficacy of the NDC , even after single - dose administration . Results 11A4 - ABD maintains high binding affinity and is internalized even in the presence of albumin For generating a nanobody drug conjugate ( NDC ) , we made use of the nanobody 11A4 that was previously selected in our group to selectively bind HER2 [ 44 ] . In order to achieve extension of serum half - life in vivo , 11A4 , as well as the irrelevant nanobody R2 , were genetically fused at their C - terminus to the sequence encoding for the albumin - binding domain ( ABD ; G148 - GA3 ) derived from the Streptococcal protein G [ 39 ] . A C - terminal free cysteine was included in all sequences , to allow for site - specific conjugation . This was followed by a C - tag ( also termed EPEA tag ) to facilitate protein purification ( Figure 1A ) . The different nanobody constructs were produced in E . coli and C - tag purification yielded protein samples of high purity . Functionality of the free cysteine was confirmed , as site - specific conjugation to either maleimide - IRDye800CW ( abbreviated IR ; Figure S1A ) or maleimide - Alexa488 ( abbreviated A488 ) resulted in conjugates with high degrees of conjugation ( DoC ; 11A4 - IR : 0 . 7 - 0 . 8 , 11A4 - ABD - IR : 0 . 8 - 0 . 9 and R2 - ABD - IR : 0 . 8 - 1 . 0 . 11A4 - A488 and 11A4 - ABD - A488 : 0 . 9 ) . It was confirmed that both HER2 - targeted nanobody conjugates specifically bind to HER2 - over - expressing BT - 474 cells , with similar affinities ( K D , 11A4 = 8 . 3 ± 2 . 6 nM , K D , 11A4 - ABD = 3 . 0 ± 0 . 4 nM ; Figure S1B ) , whereas no binding was observed on HER2 - negative MDA - MB - 231 cells . No binding of the irrelevant control R2 - ABD - IR was detected on either of the cell lines . These findings illustrate that the fusion of the ABD has no influence on either the binding specificity or the affinity of 11A4 ( Figure S1B ) . The nanobody - ABD fusions showed high binding affinity for both mouse serum ( MSA ; K D , MSA : 5 . 5 ± 1 . 6 nM ) and human serum albumin ( HSA ; K D , MSA : 6 . 6 ± 1 . 8 nM ) , while no binding to bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) was observed ( Figure S1C ) , in agreement with previously reported data [ 45 , 51 ] . Consequently , BSA could be used as a blocking agent for the subsequent ELISA - based assays . Importantly , pre - incubation of 11A4 - ABD with either MSA or HSA , to allow a complex formation with albumin , minimally affected the apparent binding affinity of 11A4 - ABD - albumin complex on BT - 474 cells ( Figure 1B ; K D , + HSA = 4 . 8 ± 1 . 0 nM , K D , + MSA = 8 . 0 ± 1 . 4 nM , compared to K D , 11A4 - ABD = 3 . 0 ± 0 . 4 nM ) . Since 11A4 - ABD was intended to be used in vivo , we evaluated whether physiologically relevant concentrations of albumin could compete with HER2 binding . As indicated by the line fitted for competitive binding , there is no competition observed with either Theranostics 2021 , Vol . 11 , Issue 11 http : / / www . thno . org 5528 MSA ( Figure 1C ) or HSA ( Figure S1D ) for 11A4 - ABD - IR binding on BT - 474 cells , even when binding was assessed in 100 % BALB / c mouse plasma ( ~ 0 . 342 mM MSA ) or 100 mg / ml ( 1 . 5 mM ) HSA . Nanobody endocytosis , essential for NDC efficacy , was evaluated using BT - 474 cells . Both 11A4 and 11A4 - ABD were able to internalize during this 15 min incubation ( Figure 1D ) , either in the presence or absence of HSA ( k e , 11A4 : 0 . 0076 ± 0 . 002 min - 1 , k e , 11A4 + HSA : 0 . 0108 ± 0 . 0025 min - 1 , k e , 11A4 - ABD : 0 . 0038 ± 0 . 0005 min - 1 , k e , 11A4 - ABD + HSA : 0 . 0033 ± 0 . 0005 min - 1 ) . These data suggested that a monovalent NDC based on these 11A4 constructs would be able to mediate intracellular drug delivery . 11A4 - ABD maintains the diffusion characteristics of 11A4 in vitro To study the diffusion characteristics of 11A4 - ABD in the presence of HSA , distribution studies in three - dimensional in vitro BT - 474 spheroids were performed . Spheroids pre - treated with HSA - A647 were incubated with either 11A4 - A488 or 11A4 - ABD - A488 in the presence of equimolar amounts of HSA - Alexa647 ( HSA - A647 ) for different time intervals . Fixed samples were imaged and the distribution of the bound fluorescent probes , at a z - plane around the middle of the spheroid , was further analyzed ( Figure 2A , S2 ) . Images were thresholded just above background . Based on the percentage of the covered area , the probe’s displacement was calculated ( Figure S2 ) , expressed as a percentage of spheroid radius and plotted over time ( Figure 2B ) . Both 11A4 - A488 and 11A4 - ABD - A488 rapidly penetrated into the spheroid core , resulting in coverage of approximately 50 % of the spheroid’s radius already after 5 h of incubation ( Figure 2 ) . HSA - A647 signal was only detected in the presence of 11A4 - ABD - A488 , following a similar penetration pattern as 11A4 - ABD - A488 itself , indicating that the latter construct can simultaneously bind to albumin Figure 1 . 11A4 - ABD shows high binding affinity and is internalized in HER2 expressing cells , regardless of albumin presence .

B ) Binding to HER2 expressing BT - 474 cells of IRDye800 conjugated 11A4 - ABD ( 11A4 - ABD - IR ) alone ( green ) or in the presense of human serum albumin ( HSA ; red ) or mouse serum albumin ( MSA ; blue ) .

The data shown are representative experiments . Values were plotted as mean ±SD ( n = 3 ) . Theranostics 2021 , Vol . 11 , Issue 11 http : / / www . thno . org 5529 and HER2 ( Figure 2A , B ) . Despite the presence of HSA , 11A4 - ABD - A488 and 11A4 - A488 showed a similar trend , with both of them distributing throughout the spheroids within 24 h , suggesting that interaction with HSA via the ABD does not hamper the penetration of 11A4 - ABD . Fusion to ABD extends the serum half - life of nanobodies To explicitly assess the effect of ABD - fusion on the serum half - life of nanobodies , the irrelevant nanobody R2 was used in order to avoid any pharmacokinetic alterations resulting from a possible target - specific nanobody interaction ( “sink effect” ) . The in vivo serum half - life of both iodinated R2 and R2 - ABD ( SEC - purified ; Figure S3 ) was evaluated in tumor - free mice that were injected with a single dose of 125 I - probe . After measuring blood radioactivity levels at different time points post injection ( p . i . ) , it was confirmed that fusion to ABD resulted in a 14 . 8 - fold increase in serum half - life ( Figure 3A ; 125 I - R2 τ β 1 / 2 : 3 . 0 h and 125 I - R2 - ABD τ β 1 / 2 : 44 . 5 h ) . This increase gave rise to larger areas under the curve ( AUC ; AUC R2 : 5 . 7 μ g ⋅ h ⋅ mL - 1 and AUC R2 - ABD : 201 . 3 μ g ⋅ h ⋅ mL - 1 ) that translate to decreased clearance rates ( CL R2 : 2 . 17 mL ⋅ h - 1 and CL R2 - ABD : 0 . 09 mL ⋅ h - 1 ) for the irrelevant nanobody R2 - ABD , compared to R2 . The distribution volumes calculated suggest broad extravascular distribution for both , with R2 - ABD being slightly less distributed ( V d , R2 : 9 . 4 mL and V d , R2 - ABD : 5 . 6 mL ) . Importantly , no non - specific accumulation , suggesting non - specific targeting via the ABD , was observed for R2 - ABD at any of the organs analyzed 4 days after probe administration ( Figure 3B ) . Because of its extended serum half - life , 125 I - R2 - ABD was still detected in the blood of mice 4 days after administration ( 3 . 056 ± 0 . 318 % ID / g tissue ) , at levels 120 times higher compared to that of 125 I - R2 ( 0 . 024 ± 0 . 015 % ID / g tissue ) ( Figure 3B ) . 11A4 - ABD shows prolonged tumor accumulation in vivo To evaluate the influence of half - life extension on tumor accumulation , BALB / c nude mice bearing BT - 474 tumors were intravenously injected with a single dose of either 11A4 - IR , 11A4 - ABD - IR or R2 - ABD - IR allowing for molecular optical imaging analysis . At early time points , fluorescent signal was observed throughout the entire body of the mice for all three probes ( Figure 3C , S4A ) , as quantified by the background fluorescence measured at a non - tumor skin region of the pelvic area ( Figure S4B ) . For both HER2 - targeted nanobodies , tumor specific accumulation was observed already 1 h p . i . in BT - 474 but not in control MDA - MB - 231 xenografted mice ( Figure 3C - D , S4A , S5A , S5C ) . Fluorescence signal of 11A4 - ABD - IR at the tumor showed a gradual increase , reaching a maximum at 5 h p . i . It remained high for more than 24 h , while 3 days p . i . it was still present at levels above background , demonstrating a Figure 2 .

Theranostics 2021 , Vol . 11 , Issue 11 http : / / www . thno . org 5530 prolonged tumor accumulation when compared to 11A4 - IR ( Figure 3D , S4 ) . In both BT - 474 and MDA - MB - 231 xenografted mice , background signal levels followed the same trend overtime ( Figure S4B , S5B ) . In line with their longer half - life , background signal of the ABD - IR nanobodies persisted longer than 11A4 - IR ( Figure S4B , S5B ) . Instead , due to its rapid renal clearance , as highlighted by the prominent signal in the kidneys , 11A4 - IR background signal started fading away already 1 h p . i . Indicative of the different pharmacokinetics of ABD - fused nanobodies was their strongly diminished signal in the kidneys of mice bearing either HER2 - positive or negative xenografts ( Figure S4A , S5A ) .

Theranostics 2021 , Vol . 11 , Issue 11 http : / / www . thno . org 5531 Due to tissue and skin - mediated fluorescence absorption and scattering , as well as positioning of the tumors , optical molecular imaging analysis is considered semi - quantitative . For quantitative analysis of the IR - labeled nanobody uptake in tumors and organs , a biodistribution on tissues resected 72 h p . i . was performed ( Figure 3E ) . In BT - 474 tumor bearing mice , 11A4 - ABD - IR showed a significantly higher tumor accumulation over 11A4 - IR ( 5 . 8 ± 2 . 3 % ID / g tissue for 11A4 - ABD - IR and 1 . 1 ± 1 . 3 % ID / g tissue for 11A4 - IR ) and the irrelevant control R2 - ABD - IR ( 1 . 8 ± 0 . 4 % ID / g tissue ) ( Figure 3E ) . Furthermore , immunohistochemistry of resected BT - 474 tumors indicated a homogeneous distribution for 11A4 - ABD - IR 72 h p . i . ( Figure 3F ) . The fluorescent signal of 11A4 - IR was barely detectable compared to 11A4 - ABD - IR , being in agreement with the imaging and biodistribution data . This tumor accumulation was HER2 target - specific , as no probe was retained in MDA - MB - 231 xenografts ( Figure S5D ) . Of equal importance was the statistically significant reduction in kidney retention of the ABD - bearing nanobodies when compared to 11A4 - IR ( 54 . 0 ± 10 . 7 % ID / g tissue for 11A4 - IR , versus 10 . 9 ± 3 . 8 % and 8 . 4 ± 1 . 3 % ID / g tissue for 11A4 - ABD - IR and R2 - ABD - IR , respectively ) . This reduction was accompanied by a significant increase in liver content of ABD - containing probes ( 11A4 - IR : 3 . 8 ± 1 . 2 % ID / g tissue , 11A4 - ABD - IR : 9 . 2 ± 1 . 4 % ID / g tissue , R2 - ABD - IR : 8 . 3 ± 1 . 0 % ID / g tissue ) being in agreement with their altered pharmacokinetics and different clearance routes , as also indicated by the imaging study . Both 11A4 and 11A4 - ABD auristatin F conjugates are highly potent in vitro Auristatin F ( AF ) was conjugated via the free C - terminal cysteine of the nanobodies using common maleimide - thiol conjugation or the platinum - based Lx linker . The obtained AF NDCs presented high purity , a drug - to - antibody ratio ( DAR ) of 1 . 0 and the expected molecular weight , as confirmed by SEC - MS analysis ( Figure S6 ) . All four 11A4 - based NDCs showed specific binding to HER2 - positive BT - 474 and NCI - N87 cells with nanomolar range K D s , but not to HER2 - negative MDA - MB - 231 ( Figure 4A ) , being comparable to the nanobodies prior to conjugation ( Figure S1B ) . Similar to what was observed for BT - 474 cells , both 11A4 and 11A4 - ABD were internalized by NCI - N87 cells ( k e , 11A4 + HSA : 0 . 0135 ± 0 . 0013 min - 1 , k e , 11A4 - ABD : 0 . 0037 ± 0 . 0006 min - 1 , k e , 11A4 - ABD + HSA : 0 . 0036 ± 0 . 0006 min - 1 , Figure S7 ) , eventually chosen to be used for establishing xenografts for the in vivo efficacy testing of the NDCs . The anti - proliferative effect of both maleimide - and Lx - AF conjugated NDCs was evaluated after five days of treatment . Cytotoxicity at low nanomolar concentrations was observed for HER2 - positive BT - 474 and NCI - N87 cells ( Figure 4B ) for all HER2 - targeted NDCs . At the same time , the viability of HER2 - negative MDA - MB - 231 cells was not affected , indicating that cytotoxicity is highly target dependent ( Figure 4B ) . Furthermore , treatment of cells with the nanobody alone did not reduce cell viability ( Figure S8 ) , supporting that the observed cytotoxicity is attributed to the conjugated AF of the NDC constructs . Single dose administration of 11A4 - ABD - AF resulted in significant tumor regression To evaluate the effect that nanobody half - life extension can have on NDC in vivo efficacy , mice bearing NCI - N87 xenografts received a single intravenous dose of 250 nmol / kg of 11A4 - mal - AF , 11A4 - Lx - AF , 11A4 - ABD - mal - AF or 11A4 - ABD - Lx - AF . The dose chosen was assumed to be safe , based on previous studies performed with AF - Lx - trastuzumab conjugates [ 42 ] , and was further confirmed after the administration of a single NDC bolus injection at 500 nmol / kg of 11A4 - Lx - AF ( DAR 1 . 0 ) and 11A4 - ABD - Lx - AF ( DAR 1 . 0 ) in non - tumor - bearing mice ( Figure S9 ) . For the efficacy study in tumor bearing mice , control animals received the same volume of PBS as used for the NDC groups ( Figure S10A ) . During the first 10 days , all tumors of NDC treated groups showed growth delay in comparison to the control group ( Figure 5A , S11A ) . In groups that received 11A4 - mal - AF or 11A4 - Lx - AF , tumors regrowth was observed from day 10 onwards . At day 83 of the experiment , all mice of PBS or 11A4 - Lx - AF were euthanized , as tumor size has reached a maximum , as defined by the humane endpoint of the study ( Figure 5C , S11A , S11D ) . For the group injected with 11A4 - mal - AF , only one mouse survived from that day until the end of the study ( Figure 5C , S11B ) . Though , we believe this was not treatment related , as tumors had below average tumor volume and their size had decreased already 3 days p . i . ( Figure S11B ) . Remarkably , in the groups that received the half - life extended NDCs , tumor remission was sustained until day 100 . Only a slight tumor size increase , to a volume below the one at the day of NDC administration , was observed during the last 24 days of the study ( Figure 5B ) . Finally , 7 out of 8 mice treated with either 11A4 - ABD - mal - AF or 11A4 - ABD - Lx - AF survived until the end study , at day 124 ( Figure 5C , S11C , S11E ) , without showing any significant weight loss throughout the study , indicating good tolerability of the administered NDCs ( Figure S10B ) .

Values plotted as mean ± SD ( n = 3 ) . The tables display K D and IC 50 ( mean ± SD ) as calculated from the graphs in A ) and B ) respectively . Discussion Antibody drug conjugates are becoming an important category of targeted anti - cancer agents used in the clinic , as supported by the growing number of approved ADCs . However , their non - homogenous intratumoral distribution can often compromise their therapeutic effect . In the present study we showed that fusion of an albumin binding domain to the HER2 - targeted nanobody 11A4 extended its serum half - life in mice without compromising its homogenous intratumoral distribution . This half - life extension resulted in the exceptional in vivo efficacy of the 11A4 - ABD - auristatin F conjugates , already after a single - dose administration . These findings demonstrate that monovalent nanobodies can be effectively used for the development of NDCs for the treatment of solid tumors . After verifying that fusion of ABD did not affect the binding properties of the nanobody ( Figure 1B , S1B ) , the irrelevant nanobody R2 was exploited to analyze the effect of ABD on nanobody’s serum half - life . The high binding affinity to mouse serum albumin ( Figure S1C , in agreement with previous data [ 45 ] ) , resulted in a 14 . 8 - fold increase in the serum half - life of R2 - ABD ( 44 . 5 h ) , compared to R2 ( 3 h ) . This corresponds to four times longer half - life compared to the half - life reported for an irrelevant nanobody fused to an anti - albumin nanobody ( τ β 1 / 2 , Irr1 - Hle1 : 13 . 8 h ) , although that one had a considerably lower affinity for albumin [ 52 ] . Organ - radioactivity levels of 125 I - R2 - ABD were lower than those in the blood . This implies absence of non - specific 125 I - R2 - ABD organ retention , suggesting that albumin - binding per se is the dominant factor mediating its slower clearance . This is further supported by the fact that the observed half - life of R2 - ABD is similar to the measured half - life of radioiodinated albumin in mice ( ⁓ 39h ) [ 53 ] . Assuming that nanobody - ABD clearance will follow that of human serum albumin , we anticipate that its half - life in humans will be close to 19 days and thus closer to that of human IgGs [ 54 ] .

Nude mice bearing NCI - N87 tumors in both flanks received a single bolus injection of NDCs with DAR of 1 . 0 at a dose of 250 nmol / kg . A ) Schematic representation of the therapeutic efficacy study . B ) Relative tumor volume , expressed as mean ± SD , was measured twice a week for 124 days ; and C ) Kaplan - Meier survival curves of mice injected with 11A4 - mal - AF ( yellow filled squares , n = 8 ) , 11A4 - ABD - mal - AF ( green filled circles , n = 8 ) , 11A4 - Lx - AF ( brown open squares , n = 8 ) and 11A4 - ABD - Lx - AF ( green open circles , n = 8 ) or PBS ( black diamonds , n = 8 ) at day 0 . For representation purposes , tumor size of a given group was not included in the graph anymore when animal drop - out was more than 50 % . Size of individual tumors can be found in Supplementary Figure S11 . In addition , tumor accumulation of 11A4 - ABD was also prolonged , as was previously observed for other antibody fragments and nanobodies fused to albumin binding moieties [ 55 – 57 ] . For 11A4 , the highest tumor fluorescence intensity was observed already 1 h post injection ( p . i . ) , being in agreement with previously reported data [ 44 ] . Indicative of the difference in pharmacokinetics , tumor fluorescence signal of 11A4 - ABD showed a more gradual increase , reaching and maintaining a maximum from 5 to 24 h p . i . In vivo molecular imaging and biodistribution revealed reduced kidney retention for both targeted and irrelevant ABD - fused nanobodies . Concomitantly , the liver content increased for the nanobody - ABD constructs indicating that renal clearance partly shifted to catabolism at the liver . Such a drastic decrease in renal clearance and retention was not documented for neither the bivalent construct ( aTNF - aTNF - aAlb , serving as non - targeting control of that study [ 56 ] ) nor for anti - HGF monovalent nano - bodies [ 58 ] , both employing anti - albumin nanobodies ( anti - Alb ) instead of an ABD peptide for half - life extension . However , in those studies the hexa - histidine purification tag ( 6x His ) was not removed prior to in vivo administration . In general , kidney retention can depend on the charge of the molecule , and has been suggested to be megalin mediated [ 59 ] , with IRDye800CW - labelled nanobodies reported to have extended kidney retention [ 60 ] . The EPEA tag used in the present study could be offering an advantage over the highly charged 6× His tag of the anti - Alb - containing constructs , that has been shown to result in increased kidney retention [ 61 ] . Nevertheless , it cannot be excluded that the albumin dissociation constants of ABD and anti - Alb nanobody could also influence this . A direct comparison of such constructs is necessary to clarify the contribution of the purification tag and of the albumin binding moiety in kidney retention . Overall , based on our observations , the use of EPEA tagged ABD - fused constructs can be considered advantageous when designing NDCs , as it could decrease the accumulation of an NDC in the kidneys and thus minimize the risks of nephrotoxicity . Furthermore , our in vivo imaging study shows that the transient increase in the hydrodynamic radius of 11A4 - ABD did not affect its homogeneous intra - tumoral distribution in vivo . This was already anticipated , as 11A4 and 11A4 - ABD had comparable diffusion patterns in HER2 - expressing 3D spheroids that have been proposed to be a good in vitro model to evaluate in vivo distribution [ 49 ] . Consequently , 11A4 - ABD could be expected to maintain the intra - tumoral distribution advantage demonstrated in Theranostics 2021 , Vol . 11 , Issue 11 http : / / www . thno . org 5534 in vivo imaging studies of monovalent HER2 - targeted nanobodies over trastuzumab [ 50 ] . As expected from previous studies with AF - trastuzumab [ 42 ] , our NDCs demonstrated high cytotoxicity only against HER2 - expressing cells . NDCs were able to bind and internalize , with internalization rate constants ( k e ) being in the same range of what has been described for HER2 and HER2 - targeted nanobodies [ 34 , 46 , 62 ] , therefore allowing for cytoplasmic drug delivery . No significant differences were seen between the IC 50 of 11A4 - AF and 11A4 - ABD - AF , after 5 days of treatment in vitro . This observation was in agreement with the similar k e s of 11A4 and 11A4 - ABD , that could eventually be translated in comparable cytosolic concentrations of the delivered AF after 5 days . We finally tested the in vivo efficacy of AF NDCs in mice bearing xenografts established after inoculation of HER2 - positive NCI - N87 cells . A single bolus injection of 250 nmol / kg of 11A4 - ABD - AF demonstrated excellent efficacy in vivo . Durable remissions ( > 124 days ) were observed with 11A4 - ABD - AF conjugates - much longer than with 11A4 - AF conjugates - irrespective of whether maleimide or Lx conjugation was used . In total 7 out of 8 mice treated with either 11A4 - ABD - mal - AF or 11A4 - ABD - Lx - AF survived until the end of the study at day 124 . These therapeutic results are very similar to results previously obtained in the same xenograft model with trastuzumab - mal - AF and trastuzumab - Lx - AF [ 42 ] . The similar efficacy of the 11A4 - ABD - AF and trastuzumab - AF conjugates is remarkable when taking into account the tumor uptake levels . In the present therapy studies , 11A4 - ABD - AF was used at an AF dose of 250 nmol / kg . Based on the imaging studies , the tumor uptake levels of 11A4 - ABD could possibly be in the range of ~ 6 % ID / g at 3 days after injection . After administration of a single bolus injection of trastuzumab - AF at a dose of 15 mg / kg and a DAR of 2 . 6 , translating to roughly 260 nmol / kg , Sijbrandi and colleagues have reported trastuzumab - AF tumor uptake levels of 31 . 0 ± 6 . 0 % ID / g , 4 days p . i . [ 42 ] . These combined results suggest that the lower tumor uptake of 11A4 - ABD - AF , as opposed to trastuzumab - AF , seems to be compensated by the more homogeneous tumor distribution of the NDC , resulting in similar efficacy for both types of constructs . Further MTD and efficacy studies with 11A4 - ABD - AF , and side - by - side comparison with trastuzumab - AF , are needed to assess which of the two constructs has the most favorable therapeutic potential . Interestingly , trastuzumab has been shown to localize in brain metastasis both in pre - clinical models [ 35 ] and in patients [ 63 ] , something most probably explained by the presence of a fenestrated endothelium in brain lesions . Puttemans et al reported higher tumor accumulation for the HER2 - targeted nanobody [ 111 In ] - 2Rs15d ( 1h p . i . ) compared to [ 111 I ] - Trastuzumab ( 3d p . i . ) administered in a mouse model bearing intracranial SK - OV - 3 tumors , suggested to have less disrupted BBB . Hence , it would be of great interest to compare small - sized ABD - fused NDCs with trastuzumab , or trastuzumab - based ADCs also in the context of HER2 - expressing brain metastases treatment , which are frequently linked with poor prognosis for breast cancer patients . The model used in the present study is based on a highly expressed tumor target . Yet , targets with lower expression or with very slow internalization rates could be employed instead . In these cases , the use of bivalent NDCs should be considered in order to stimulate more efficient cytosolic delivery of the conjugated drug . However , increased internalization rate , along with high binding affinity and valency ( linked with a low k off ) can slow down or even completely prevent diffusion towards the center of the tumor mass [ 64 , 65 ] . The choice of an ABD over anti - Alb for half - life extension , can prevent a further increase in the size of dimeric constructs . Such a size increase could potentially affect their tumoral distribution , as suggested by studies where fusion to a non - targeting nanobody has been employed to account for the size effect [ 49 , 50 ] . Along these lines , in one of the very few examples of a solid tumor targeting NDCs , a cisplatin conjugated biparatopic anti - EGFR nanobody construct fused to anti - Alb was not able to demonstrate comparable tumor remission [ 66 ] . The tumor model used as well as differences in the dosing , payload ( repeated administration of an a NDC with 3× higher DAR versus single administration of a dose twice as high used here ) and physicochemical characteristics compared to the conjugates used in the current study could be greatly affecting their efficacy . A direct comparison between the distribution of these two different NDC formats would be very interesting to explore experimentally , in order to also evaluate how different half - life extension strategies ( i . e . anti - Alb nanobody versus ABD ) can be affecting NDC efficacy . Recently , Nessler et al ( 2020 ) reported equally promising results using single - domain antibody - based drug conjugates in a prostate cancer model [ 21 ] . As demonstrated in penetration studies performed in spheroids , as well as histological analysis of tumors , monovalent prostate - specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) - targeting Humabodies ® ( fully human heavy - chain variable domain antibodies derived from the Crescendo mouse ) were able to distribute more homogeneously compared to bivalent Humabodies or Theranostics 2021 , Vol . 11 , Issue 11 http : / / www . thno . org 5535 the monoclonal antibody used as reference in the study . Anti - PSMA Humabody conjugates were not able to demonstrate comparable remissions in a tumor model of high expressing cells ( ⁓ 10 6 receptors / cell ) , which is similar to the HER2 expression levels of the NCI - N87 cells in this study . On the other hand , the monomeric serum half - life - extended Humabody - drug conjugate demonstrated excellent efficacy in the moderate PSMA expression ( < 10 5 receptors / cell ) xenograft model , already after single dose administration of a considerably lower dose compared to that of 11A4 - ABD - AF . Even though a direct comparison cannot be performed , as different target and payload are used , both studies are highlighting that homogenous targeting of a larger population of cells , by means of smaller monovalent NDCs , can correlate with better efficacy when sufficient exposure is guaranteed . In conclusion , we have shown that nanobodies can be successfully used as a platform for the development of drug conjugates that can offer more complete tumor targeting . Of key importance for their in vivo efficacy is the extension of their serum half - life . Herein , we demonstrated that half - life extension , by the fusion of an ABD to the C - terminus of an anti - HER2 nanobody , resulted in prolonged and homogeneous tumor accumulation , accompanied by reduced kidney retention . A single dose administration of internalizing monovalent AF conjugates targeting HER2 resulted in excellent efficacy in a model of HER2 overexpressing tumors in vivo . This demonstrates the great potential of such an approach , encouraging further testing in different tumor models . Methods An in - depth description of production , purification and functionalization of nanobodies , as well as of the assays used for their in vitro characterization can be found in the Supplementary Materials and Methods . Cell lines All cancer cell lines used in this study were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) ( LGC Standards , Germany ) . The HER2 - positive invasive ductal carcinoma cell line BT - 474 ( ATCC ® HTB - 20 ™ ) and the HER2 - negative adenocarcinoma MDA - MB - 231 ( ATCC ® HTB - 26 ™ ) were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco ' s Modified Eagle ' s Medium ( DMEM 4 . 5 g / l glucose L - Glutamine ; Lonza Benelux BV , Breda , the Netherlands ) , while the HER2 - positive gastric carcinoma NCI - N87 cells ( ATCC ® CRL - 5822 ™ ) were cultured in RPMI - 1640 medium ( L - Glutamine , 25 mM HEPES , Gibco ™ ; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc , Breda , the Netherlands ) . All media were supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; GE Healthcare Europe GmbH , Eindhoven the Netherlands ) , 100 U / ml penicillin and 100 μg / ml streptomycin ( Sigma - Aldrich BV , Zwijndrecht , the Netherlands ) . Cells were kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 and were constantly tested negative for Mycoplasma . Nanobody constructs Codon optimized genes encoding for the HER2 - targeted nanobody 11A4 [ 44 ] and the irrelevant nanobody R2 [ 67 ] , fused to the streptococcal protein G ABD sequence [ 39 ] were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies ( IDT BVA , Leuven , Belgium ) and ligated into a pET28a vector provided with a C - terminal cysteine and EPEA affinity purification tag . Nanobody production , purification , iodination and fluorophore conjugation Nanobodies were produced and affinity purified from the periplasmic space of BL21 - CodonPlus ( DE3 ) - RIL E . coli bacteria employing the EPEA tag . Sample’s purity was analyzed with 15 % SDS - PAGE and stored at - 20 °C until further use . For radiolabeling of nanobodies the Iodogen method was used [ 68 ] . Nanobodies were labeled at their C - terminal cysteine with the near infrared fluorophore IRDye800CW ( IR ) - maleimide or Alexa488 - maleimide . Human Serum Albumin ( HSA ) was randomly conjugated to NHS - Alexa647 . The amount of free fluorophore was below 5 % in all samples . Auristatin F nanobody conjugate synthesis Free C - terminal cysteine - containing 11A4 and 11A4 - ABD were used for conjugation to auristatin F either via maleimide or employing the Lx linker technology following the procedure described in detail in the Supplementary methods . All samples were subjected to SDS - PAGE and SEC - MS analysis to evaluate their purity and integrity prior to use in vivo . Binding affinity determination on cells Binding affinity determination of nanobodies and NDCs on BT - 474 , NCI - N87 and MDA - MB - 231 cells was done as described previously [ 44 ] . Essentially , a dilution series of the different constructs were incubated with cells for 2 h at 4 o C , in the presence or absence of HSA . Bound nanobodies were either directly detected via measuring the IR fluorescence intensity of nanobody conjugates or indirectly detecting NDCs using an anti - VHH antibody . Theranostics 2021 , Vol . 11 , Issue 11 http : / / www . thno . org 5536 Evaluation of interaction with serum albumin An ELISA on immobilized serum albumin from different species was used to determine the binding affinity of ABD - containing nanobodies for albumin . To evaluate whether albumin competes for binding on HER2 expressing cells , a constant concentration of directly conjugated 11A4 - ABD was incubated with cells in the presence of varying amounts of BALB / c mouse plasma or HSA . Evaluation of nanobody internalization in cells Internalization of the different nanobody constructs was measured after incubation of a constant concentration of IR - conjugated samples with HER2 expressing cells at 37 °C for a period of 15 min . Total fluorescence as well as fluorescence attributed to the internalized fraction were measured and used to calculate the internalization rate constant as described by Heukers et al . [ 69 ] . In vitro cell viability assay The effect of auristatin F nanobody conjugates on the in vitro cell viability was measured using the AlamarBlue ® Reagent , following provider’s protocol . Spheroid 3D cell culture and immuno - fluorescence staining Three dimensional tumor cell spheroids of BT - 474 cells were cultured on top of a Matrigel ® scaffold and allowed to grow up to a size with a radius below 200 μm . Spheroids were treated for different time intervals with Alexa488 fluorescently labeled nanobodies in the presence of HSA - Alexa647 . Paraformaldehyde - fixed samples were imaged using confocal laser scanning microscopy . Determination of percentage of radius of area covered by the fluorescent proteins Spheroid images were acquired at a z - plane at the middle of the spheroid . Using ImageJ , obtained images were thresholded just above background . The thresholded area , corresponding to the area covered by the diffusing probe , as well as the total spheroid area were used to calculate the probe’s displacement . See Supplementary Material and Methods for a detailed description . Evaluation of in vivo half - life All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Principles of Laboratory Animal Care and Dutch national law ( “Wet op de dierproeven” , Staatsblad 1985 , 336 ) . For the determination of the nanobody half - life in blood circulation , two different groups of four female nude mice ( BALB / cOlaHsd - Foxn1 nu ) received intravenously 2 . 8x10 7 cpm of either R2 ( 12 . 5 μ g ) or R2 - ABD ( 17 . 5 μ g ) 125 I - labeled nanobody . Blood samples ( 10 μl ) were withdrawn through the vena saphena at 3 min , 30 min , 1 , 3 , 7 , 24 , 48 , 72 and 96 h post injection ( p . i . ) and radioactivity levels were immediately measured with a Packard Cobra II γ - counter ( PerkinElmer ) . The percentage of injected dose ( % ID ) was calculated and plotted as μ g per mL of blood over time . A curve was fitted with a two - phase decay model and terminal half - life [ τ β 1 / 2 ( hours ) ] as well as Area Under the Curve ( AUC ) , Clearance [ CL ( mL / time ) = Dose ( μ g ) / AUC ( μ g / mL ⋅ min ) ] , Rate of elimination [ k e ( h - 1 ) = ln2 / τ β 1 / 2 ] and Volume of distribution = [ V d ( mL ) = CL / k e ] were calculated . In vivo optical molecular imaging experiments For the optical imaging study female nude mice ( BALB / cOlaHsd - Foxn1 nu ) bearing BT - 474 xenografts of an average size of 79 mm 3 received intravenously 50 μg of a ) 11A4 - ABD - IR ( n = 4 ) , b ) R2 - ABD - IR ( n = 4 ) and c ) 11A4 - IR ( n = 2 ) . Mice with MDA - MB - 231 tumors received 50 μg of a ) 11A4 - ABD - IR ( n = 4 ) or b ) R2 - ABD - IR ( n = 4 ) . For imaging , mice were anesthetized and images were acquired before administration and 1 , 2 , 5 , 24 , 48 and 72 h p . i . using Pearl ® Impulse Small Animal Imaging System ( LI - COR ® Biosciences , Westburg BV , Leusden , the Netherlands ) . Images were analyzed using Pearl Impulse Software v2 . 0 ( LI - COR ® Biosciences ) were regions of interest ( ROI ; same size within each mouse ) were drawn around the tumors and at normal tissue areas ( background ) , fluorescent intensity per pixel was calculated and plotted over time . After the last imaging time point , mice were sacrificed and organs as well as tumors were collected . Tissue biodistribution of IR - probes as well as histological analysis of formalin fixed tumors were performed as described in supplementary Materials and Methods . In vivo safety and efficacy experiments In order to evaluate possible systemic toxicity of the auristatin - F NDCs , two groups of 5 animals each ( female 6 - 8 weeks old athymic Nude - Foxn1 Nu mice ) received retro - orbitally a single 8 mg / kg dose of either 11A4 - Lx - AF or 11A4 - ABD - Lx - AF . Weight was monitored daily for a total of 14 days . Safe dosing was determined as one where body weight reduction at two consecutive time points was not more than 10 % relative to the body weight at the start of the experiment . For the efficacy study , mice bearing subcutaneous NCI - N87 tumors on both flanks ( average tumor size of 80 mm 3 ) were randomly grouped ( 8 mice per group ) and received a single Theranostics 2021 , Vol . 11 , Issue 11 http : / / www . thno . org 5537 bolus dose of NDCs at 250 nmol / kg ( dose volume : 100 μ L per 25 g ) by retro - orbital injection . Groups were treated with either a ) 11A4 - Mal - AF or b ) 11A4 - Lx - AF or c ) 11A4 - ABD - Lx - AF or d ) 11A4 - ABD - Mal - AF or PBS , which served as the vehicle control . Tumor volume as well as body weight were measured twice a week over a period of 124 days after injection . Individual animals were monitored until a humane endpoint was reached ( among others tumor size greater than 1000 mm 3 and acute irreversible weight loss ) . Tumors between 50 and 300 mm 3 at the start of treatment were included in the final tumor regression calculations . Statistical analysis The statistical analysis of the tissue biodistribution was performed using Welch’s t - test of unpaired samples . A two - tailed significance was calculated , and P values < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant .
