ABSTRACT Epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is an important biological process whereby malignant tumor cells obtain the ability to migrate , invade , resist apoptosis and degrade the extracellular matrix . We found that Cofilin1 ( CFL1 ) expression was elevated in clinical gastric cancer specimens and correlated with biomarkers of EMT in BGC - 823 gastric cancer cells . BGC - 823 cells exhibited EMT phenotypes and increased metastatic ability when induced by TGF - β1 . By contrast , BGC - 823 cells transfected with Lv - siRNA - CFL1 did not exhibit EMT phenotypes under the same inducing conditions . As CFL1 expression increased , EMT cell filopodia stretched out . In addition , the ultrastructures observed using transmission electron microscopy indicated that silencing of CFL1 markedly inhibited depolymerization of fibrous actin and cytoskeletal reorganization during EMT . Similar results were obtained in vivo . These findings demonstrate that CFL1 induces EMT by promoting cytoskeletal rearrangement . Our results may provide the basis for developing new anticancer drugs to inhibit CFL1 . INTRODUCTION According to cancer statistics from 2015 , gastric cancer ( GC ) was the cancer with the highest incidence and mortality in China [ 1 ] . Although GC patients can benefit from early diagnosis and standardized surgical treatment , their overall survival is far from satisfactory [ 2 ] . Most tumor invasion and metastasis has already occurred by the time patients see a doctor [ 3 ] . The invasion and metastasis of GC are important factors preventing improvements in the patient survival rate ; therefore , inhibiting these processes is a critical treatment strategy [ 4 ] . The epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is the biological process whereby malignant tumor cells obtain the ability to migrate , invade [ 5 , 6 ] , resist apoptosis and degrade the extracellular matrix [ 7 , 8 ] . Cofilin 1 ( CFL1 ) is an important regulatory factor of cytoskeletal reorganization in tumor cells , and its expression strongly correlates with the EMT of tumors [ 9 – 11 ] . CFL1 may well become a new target for the treatment of malignant tumor cells undergoing the EMT , invasion and metastasis [ 12 – 15 ] . However , the specific function of CFL1 in the EMT of GC cells remains unclear [ 16 ] . In the present study , the expression of CFL1 and its relationship to the EMT was analyzed in clinical GC samples and GC cells . In addition , the mechanism whereby CFL1 is involved in the EMT in GC was assessed both in vitro and in vivo , with a particular focus on cytoskeletal reorganization . www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget / Oncotarget , 2017 , Vol . 8 , ( No . 24 ) , pp : 39131 - 39142 Research Paper Oncotarget 39132 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget RESULTS Expression of CFL1 in GC To determine the expression of CFL1 in GC tissues , we performed western blotting on 33 pair clinical samples and compared the results with those of the corresponding normal gastric tissues . CFL1 expression was markedly greater in tumor tissues than in control normal stomach tissues ( Figure 1 ) . To further confirm these results , we also quantified the expression of CFL1 in 33 pairs of frozen GC specimens . Consistent with the results obtained above , the expression of CFL1 was markedly higher in tumor tissues than in matched adjacent normal tissues . These results indicated that CFL1 was consistently upregulated in GC . EMT model and changes of cell morphology To study the involvement of CFL1 in the EMT , we used TGF - β1 to induce the EMT in BGC - 823 cells . The BGC - 823 cell morphology was greatly altered after the cells were cultured with 10 ng / mL TGF - β1 : the quadrilateral morphology became more spindle shaped . In addition , rich microfilaments endowed cells with a strong ability to migrate and invade ( Figure 2A and 2B ) . In Western blotting of EMT biomarkers , E - cadherin expression was obviously reduced , while N - cadherin , Vimentin and CFL1 expression were markedly enhanced in TGF - β1 - treated cells ( Figure 2C and 2D ) . Thus , TGF - β1 successfully induced the EMT in BGC - 823 cells . The correlation between CFL1 expression and the EMT To study the correlation between CFL1 expression and the EMT , we performed immunofluorescence and cytoskeletal staining assays simultaneously in the EMT model . The expression of CFL1 increased in accordance with the stretching out of lamellipodia and filopodia around EMT cells . Compared with the control group cells ( shown in the box ) , EMT cells appeared dark green in the immunofluorescence assay , indicating their high expression of CFL1 ( Figure 3 ) . Thus , CFL1 was directly involved in the EMT process in GC cells . Lv - CFL1 - siRNA For further studies of the function of CFL1 in GC , lentiviral vectors encoding siRNAs targeting CFL1 ( GenBank accession number NM _ 005507 ) were constructed by ABM ( Nanjing , China ) . Three different siRNAs targeting CFL1 ( Lv - CFL1 - siRNA ) were designed to ensure the interference effect . The three Lv - CFL1 - siRNAs were transfected into BGC - 823 cells with Viral - plus Transduction Enhancer G698 and polybrene so that their specificity for CFL1 disruption could be determined . The validated Lv - CFL1 - siRNA ( Target Seq : AGCATGAATTGCAAGCAAA ) was selected for the construction of the lentiviral vector ( Figure 4A and 4B ) . A non - silencing sequence was used as a negative control ( Lv - NC ) . Western blotting revealed that CFL1 was markedly silenced by the Lv - CFL1 - siRNA ( Figure 4C and 4D ) . Cytoskeletal reorganization and structural basis of the EMT BGC - 823 cells were used for a cytoskeletal staining assay in which Lv - siRNA - CFL1 cells were compared with NC cells . After the cells were cultured in the same inducing conditions for 24 hours , it was obvious that Lv - siRNA - CFL1 transfection had inhibited the EMT in terms Figure 1 : The expression of CFL1 was markedly higher in tumor tissues than in matched adjacent normal tissues . Oncotarget 39133 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget of both morphology and biomarker protein expression . In addition , the F - actin distribution was uneven and F - actin was enriched from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane when the CFL1 gene was silenced in BGC - 823 cells ( Figure 5A ) . EMT - related protein expression was also significantly lower in the Lv - siRNA - CFL1 group than in the NC / TGF - β1 group ( Figure 5B and 5C ) . CFL1 induces the EMT by promoting cytoskeletal reorganization As a further verification of the effects of CFL1 on the cytoskeleton , high - resolution TEM was used to observe the changes in the cell microstructure . The number of microfilaments in both the cytoplasm and the cell membrane were greater in the TGF - β1 - treated group than in the NC group . Under the same inducing conditions , the number of microfilaments in the Lv - siRNA - CFL1 group also increased , but most of them were concentrated in the cell membrane , and F - actin was significantly increased through G - actin polymerization into F - actin ( Figure 6A ) . Western blotting was also used to detect the levels of F - actin and G - actin . As shown in Figure 6B and 6C , TGF - β1 treatment increased the levels of F - actin and G - actin in the NC group , but only increased F - actin levels in Lv - siRNA - CFL1 group . Cell invasion and migration assays The EMT is the initial step in the ultimate enhancement of tumor cell invasion and metastasis . We used BGC - 823 cells to determine the effects of CFL1 on EMT cell invasion and metastasis . After being cultured in inducing conditions for 24 hours , Lv - NC cells were Figure 2 : ( A and B ) TGF - β1 successfully induced the EMT in BGC - 823 cells .

While 10 ng / mL TGF - β1 successfully induced tumor cell EMT , silencing of CFL1 significantly inhibited cell invasion and metastasis ( Figure 7 ) . Silencing of CFL1 suppresses tumor metastasis in vivo A nude mouse xenograft model was used to further study the effects of CFL1 inhibition on the EMT in vivo . BGC - 823 cells transfected with Lv - siRNA - CFL1 or Lv - NC were intraperitoneally injected into nude mice , and tumor metastasis was observed every seven days with a small - animal living imaging system ( Figure 8A ) . The extent of peritoneal carcinomatosis was significantly lower in the Lv - siRNA - CFL1 group than in the Lv - NC group ( Figure 8B and 8C ) . At the same time , the tumor size was measured by the reflected fluorescence signal . Metastatic tumors on the mesentery To observe the extent of tumor metastasis in the abdominal cavities of the nude mice , we removed and analyzed the mesentery . The results were consistent with Figure 6 : TEM revealed changes in the cell microstructure . ( A ) TGF - β1 increased the number of microfilaments in both the cytoplasm and the cell membrane . Lv - siRNA - CFL1 promoted actin aggregation on the cell membrane and the increase of F - actin , but reduced G - actin levels . Similar results were obtained by Western blotting ( B and C ) . Oncotarget 39137 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget the above results from the small - animal living imaging system : peritoneal carcinomatosis was significantly inhibited in the Lv - siRNA - CFL1 group compared to the Lv - NC group ( Figure 9A and 9B ) . The fluorescence signal data and the number of metastases are shown in Figure 9C and 9D . DISCUSSION GC is one of the most common malignant tumors in China , especially in rural areas [ 1 ] . Despite the benefits of early diagnosis and standardized surgical treatment , the overall survival of GC patients remains unsatisfactory [ 17 ] . Invasion and metastasis severely restrict the survival of GC patients [ 18 – 21 ] . Malignant tumor cells acquire the ability to migrate and invade as a result of the EMT [ 22 ] . In this study , we found that silencing of CFL1 significantly inhibited the EMT [ 15 ] . In addition , CFL1 expression correlated with cytoskeletal reorganization and EMT biomarker expression in GC . Based on the analysis of 33 clinical specimens , we determined that CFL1 was consistently overexpressed in GC tissues . Therefore , we speculate that CFL1 may promote tumor development . Figure 7 : ( A and B ) BGC - 823 cells achieved high levels of invasion and metastasis after being induced by TGF - β1 . The number of cells in Lv - siRNA - CFL1 group penetrating the membrane was significantly reduced in comparison to the Lv - NC group ( 100× ) . ( C and D ) The penetration of the membrane was clearly inhibited in the Lv - siRNA - CFL1 group relative to the Lv - NC group . * * * , p < 0 . 001 . Oncotarget 39138 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget Figure 8 : ( A ) Due to tumor metastasis and growth dispersion , the fluorescent signal was weaker in the Lv - NC group than in the Lv - siRNA - CFL1 group ( under the same exposure intensity ) . ( B ) The tumors in the Lv - siRNA - CFL1 group were more concentrated than those in the Lv - NC group . ( C ) The tumors in the Lv - NC group were more dispersed , and there were many tumor metastases . Oncotarget 39139 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget To further explore the involvement of CFL1 in the malignant behavior of GC , we employed the highly invasive GC cell line BGC - 823 . We found that CFL1 was overexpressed in the GC cell EMT model induced by TGF - β1 . This suggested that CFL1 was involved in the process of EMT , consistent with the data from the clinical samples . Additional evidence for the function of CFL1 in the EMT was obtained from immunofluorescence combined with a cytoskeletal staining assay . The EMT process under inducing conditions was significantly inhibited after CFL1 was silenced by Lv - siRNA - CFL1 . The absence of CFL1 was found to block actin depolymerization and inhibit the repeated disassembly and assembly of the microfilament . G - actin can only be aggregated into F - actin , and F - actin cannot be disaggregated into G - actin . This hindered the enrichment of actin and the formation of pseudopodia on the cell surface . Microscopic evidence provided by high - resolution TEM was used to support the conclusions above . TGF - β1 treatment increased the expression of CFL1 , G - actin and F - actin simultaneously . Actin filaments clustered on the cell membrane and cellular microfilament polymerization occurred . Based on the above experimental results , we believe that the silencing of CFL1 can directly inhibit cytoskeletal reorganization and destroy the structural basis for the EMT . In vitro and in vivo experiments provided additional support for the important function of CFL1 in the EMT . The silencing of CFL1 significantly inhibited the invasion and metastasis of GC cells in vitro . The same results were obtained following in vivo transplantation of nude mice . In summary , we demonstrated that CFL1 induces the EMT by promoting cytoskeletal rearrangement , while silencing of CFL1 inhibits the EMT , invasion and metastasis of GC cells . CFL1 thus appears to be a promising new target for the prognosis and treatment of GC patients . Figure 9 : ( A ) Metastatic tumor cells in the peritoneal cavities of Lv - NC nude mice .
