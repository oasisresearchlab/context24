We tested the hypothesis that circulating sex steroids modulate single - unit responses in the avian telencephalic auditory nucleus , field L . We mimicked breeding or nonbreeding conditions by manipulating plasma 17 (cid:1) - estradiol levels in wild - caught female Gambel’s white - crowned sparrows ( Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii ) . Extracellular responses of single neurons to tones and conspecific songs presented over a range of intensities revealed that estradiol selectively enhanced auditory function in cells that exhibited monotonic rate level functions to pure tones . In these cells , estradiol treatment increased spontaneous and maximum evoked firing rates , increased pure tone response strengths and sensitivity , and expanded the range of intensities over which conspecific song stimuli elicited significant re - sponses . Estradiol did not significantly alter the sensitivity or dynamic ranges of cells that exhibited non - monotonic rate level functions . Notably , there was a robust correlation between plasma estradiol concentrations in individual birds and physiological response proper - ties in monotonic , but not non - monotonic neurons . These findings demonstrate that functionally distinct classes of anatomically over - lapping forebrain neurons are differentially regulated by sex steroid hormones in a dose - dependent manner . Introduction Sex steroid hormones modulate vocal signaling in adult verte - brates ( Bass , 2008 ; Brenowitz , 2008 ) , but how these modulations impact the auditory function of listeners remains unclear . Song - birds are well suited for addressing this issue . Song is a complex , learned vocalization that serves several functions , including spe - cies and individual identification , mate attraction , and territory defense ( Catchpole and Slater , 1995 ) . In seasonal breeders , such as Gambel’s white - crowned sparrow , song behavior is sensitive to hormonal state ; high levels of circulating sex steroid hormones , typicalofthebreedingseason ( WingfieldandFarner , 1978 ) , increase singing rate , song duration , and song stereotypy ( Smith et al . , 1995 ; Meitzen et al . , 2009a ) . Associated changes in the morphology and physiology of the neural circuit underlying song production are also observed ( Nottebohm , 1981 ; Brenowitz et al . , 1991 ; Smith et al . , 1997 ; Tramontin et al . , 2003 ; Soma et al . , 2004 ; Park et al . , 2005 ; Meitzen et al . , 2007a , b , 2009b ; Phillmore et al . , 2011 ) . Recent work has explored the effect of sex steroid hormones on songbird auditory sensitivity at the level of the periphery and brain - stem ( Henry and Lucas , 2009 ; Caras et al . , 2010 ) . Additional studies haveexaminedtheimpactofsexsteroidhormonesontheprocessingofsongstimuliinregionsspecializedforsongperceptionorproduc - tionsuchasthesensorimotornucleusHVC ( propername ) , thecau - domedial nidopallium ( NCM ) or the caudomedial mesopallium ( CMM ) ( Maney et al . , 2006 ; Tremere et al . , 2009 ; Remage - Healey et al . , 2010 , 2012 ; Sanford et al . , 2010 ; Phillmore et al . , 2011 ; Tremere and Pinaud , 2011 ; Remage - Healey and Joshi , 2012 ) . Many issues remain unexplored . First , neurons in NCM , the main focus for the majority of studies on this topic , express hor - mone receptors ( Bernard et al . , 1999 ; Gahr , 2001 ; Jeong et al . , 2011 ) . Receptor expression is not a prerequisite for hormonal sensitivity , however , as steroid action can be mediated via other neuromodulatory systems ( Maney and Pinaud , 2011 ) . It is there - fore of interest to determine whether auditory regions upstream of NCM , some of which lack sex steroid receptors , are also af - fected by hormonal state . Similarly , it is unclear whether circu - lating sex steroids modulate fundamental aspects of auditory processing in the forebrain , and if so , whether the magnitude of these modulations depends on the plasma level of hormone . To address these questions , we brought adult female sparrows into breeding [ high 17 (cid:1) - estradiol ( E 2 ) ] or nonbreeding condition ( low E 2 ) in the laboratory and made in vivo extracellular record - ings from single units in the forebrain field L complex . Field L is the primary thalamic recipient of auditory information and is analogous to mammalian primary auditory cortex ( Fortune and Margoliash , 1992 ; Vates et al . , 1996 ; Reiner et al . , 2004 ) ( see Fig . 1 B ) . Unlike cells in downstream nuclei , field L neurons do not express steroid receptors ( Jeong et al . , 2011 ; Maney and Pinaud , 2011 ) . We found that modulations of systemic E 2 affect many fundamental response properties in monotonic field L neurons . ReceivedAug . 17 , 2012 ; revisedOct . 9 , 2012 ; acceptedOct . 10 , 2012 .

Birds were housed in outdoor aviaries at the Uni - versity of Washington for up to 30 weeks before being moved to indoor aviaries . Once inside , all birds were housed in groups on a short - day photoperiod ( SD ) ( 8 h light / 16 h dark ) for a minimum of 10 weeks to ensure sensitivity to the stimulating effects of hormones and photope - riod ( Wingfield et al . , 1979 ) . Food and water were available ad libitum . All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Washington , Seattle . Hormone and photoperiod manipulations Birds were brought into either nonbreeding - like condition or breeding - like condition in the laboratory . To induce a nonbreeding condition , we housed birds ( n (cid:1) 12 ) on a SD photoperiod as above . Birds housed on a SD photoperiod maintain regressed gonads , have basal plasma sex hor - mone levels , and display neural morphology and physiology typical of the nonbreeding season ( Middleton , 1965 ; Smith et al . , 1995 ; Tramontin et al . , 2000 ; Park et al . , 2005 ; Meitzen et al . , 2007b ) . To induce a breeding condition , we housed birds ( n (cid:1) 9 ) on a long day ( LD ) ( 20 h light / 4 h dark ) photoperiod typical of their Alaskan breeding grounds and im - planted them with subcutaneous hormone pellets made from SILASTIC tubing ( innerdiameter , 1 . 0mm ; outerdiameter , 2 . 0mm , length , 12mm ; VWR ) . Pellets were filled with crystalline E 2 , rinsed in ethanol , and soaked overnight in 0 . 1 M PBS before implantation ( Tramontin et al . , 2003 ) . Supplemental hormone is necessary to raise plasma hormone levels of laboratory - housed birds to physiological levels observed in breeding birds in the wild ( Smith et al . , 1995 ) . Birds were housed under these conditions for 3 weeks ; this time period is sufficient to induce neural morphology and physiology typical of the breeding season ( Tra - montin et al . , 2000 ; Park et al . , 2005 ; Meitzen et al . , 2007b ) . Electrophysiology Surgical procedures Allexperimentstookplaceinadouble - walledacousticallyisolatedcham - ber ( Acoustic Systems ) . At the beginning of each experiment , birds were anesthetized with 25 % urethane ( 6 (cid:2) l / g body weight ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , divided evenly into three intramuscular injections separated by 30 min . Supplementary doses ( 0 . 67 (cid:2) l / g ) were delivered throughout theexperimenttomaintainanestheticstateasassessedbytoepinch . After birds were fully anesthetized , we injected 0 . 1 ml of 1 % lidocaine ( APP Pharmaceuticals ) subcutaneouslyatthedorsalmidlineoftheskull , made anincision , andremovedtheskinandfascia . Ametalpostwasfixedtothe skull with dental cement ( Lang Dental ) , and birds were secured to a head holder / stereotaxicdevice . Bodytemperaturewasmaintainedat40 – 42°C by a heating pad using a cloacal thermal probe and digital controller ( TC - 1000 Temperature Controller ; CWE ) . A small craniotomy was made dorsal to field L in the right hemisphere using stereotaxic coordi - nates relative to the bifurcation of the midsagittal sinus ( 1 . 4 mm lateral , 1 . 8 – 2 . 3 mm anterior ) . The dura was removed and a glass micropipette electrode ( 5 – 19 M (cid:2) impedance ) filled with 10 % Fluoro - Ruby [ 10 , 000 molecular weight ( MW ) tetramethylrhodamine dextran ; Invitrogen ] or 10 % biontinylated detran amine ( BDA ) ( 10 , 000 MW , Invitrogen ) in 0 . 9 % NaClwaspositionedovertheopening . Theelectrodewasadvanced by an electric microdrive ( Newport ) , which was controlled by the exper - imenter from outside the sound attenuation booth . For some recording sessions , the craniotomy opening was covered in petroleum jelly to pre - vent tissue dehydration . We made one to three electrode penetrations in each bird . Although we recorded activity at a wide range of depths ( (cid:3) 800 – 3300 (cid:2) m ) , we restricted our analysis to units that were con - firmed histologically to be within field L ( see below , Electrode track reconstruction ) . Auditory processing is lateralized in songbirds , although the exact nature of hemisphere specificity depends on sex , species , brain area , anesthetic state , stimulus selection , and method of analysis ( Cynx et al . , 1992 ; George et al . , 2004 , 2005 ; Avey et al . , 2005 ; Hauber et al . , 2007 ; Poirier et al . , 2009 ; Phan and Vicario , 2010 ) . To avoid introducing a lateralization confound into our experimental design , we chose to focus only on the right hemisphere . Stimulus delivery and calibration The stimulus delivery system we employed has been used previously ( Caras et al . , 2010 ) . Briefly , a small speaker ( Etymotics ER - 2B ) and mi - crophone ( Etymotics ER - 10B ) were enclosed within a custom - made sound delivery tube and positioned flush against the skull surrounding the left external auditory meatus . Petroleum jelly was applied to the outside of the tube and skull , creating a closed sound delivery system . Sound delivery was controlled by custom scripts ( Python ) running on a computer located outside the sound attenuation chamber . Stimuli were routed through an RX6 multifunction processor ( Tucker - Davis Tech - nologies ) thatperformedbothdigital / analogconversionandattenuation of the signal before delivery to the speaker . Beforeeachexperiment , weusedrandom - phaseband - limited ( 6Hzto 20 kHz ) white noise to calibrate pure - tone sound pressure levels ( deci - belsSPLre : 20 (cid:2) Pa ) . Forourinitialexperiments , weusedthewhite - noise generated calibration table to determine root - mean squared sound pres - sure levels ( RMS decibels SPL ) for song stimuli . In later experiments , we presented individual songs to the microphone and determined RMS decibel SPL values separately for each song . The levels for earlier record - ings were corrected for each song type presented . RMS amplitudes for song stimuli were reliable within (cid:3) 4 . 9 dB SPL . Auditory stimuli We presented two different types of stimuli in this study . Pure - tone stimuli were 100 ms in duration with 5 ms linear ramp rise – fall times . Tones were generated on - line using the same custom software that con - trolled sound delivery . Song stimuli consisted of a set of songs recorded from seven individual male sparrows held under breeding condition in thelaboratory . Weusedmalesongsbecausefemalesofthisspeciesdonot sing . WerecordedsongsusingSyrinxsoftware ( JohnBurt ; www . syrinxpc . com , University of Washington , Seattle , WA ) and previously published protocols ( Meitzen et al . , 2007b , 2009a ) . Low - frequency background noisewasdigitallyfilteredoff - line . Werecordedonesongfromeachbird , for a total of seven songs . Gambel’s white - crowned sparrow songs typically consist of five sylla - bles : a whistle , a warble , and three buzzes ( see Fig . 1 A ) . The songs pre - sented in this study were 2 . 15 (cid:4) 0 . 19 s in duration ( mean (cid:4) SD ) and spanned an average frequency range of 2 . 44 – 5 . 98 kHz . These values are similar to those previously published for a larger song set ( Meitzen et al . , 2009a ) . The majority of song stimuli ( see Fig . 1 A , 1 through 4 ) were recorded from captive males before 2007 , and thus were unfamiliar to all of our experimental birds . Three songs ( seeFig . 1 A , 5 through 7 ) were recorded from males that had overlapping periods of captivity with some of the experimentalbirds , andthereforemayhavebeenfamiliar . Althoughsong familiarity can affect neurophysiological responses in more specialized auditoryregions , suchasNCM , fieldLdoesnotdisplaythischaracteristic ( Theunissenetal . , 2004 ) . Wethereforedidnotincludesongfamiliarityas a factor in our data analysis . Data acquisition We recorded the extracellular activity of well isolated single units . Spikes were amplified 10 , 000 (cid:5) ( ISO - 80 ; World Precision Instruments ; and MA3 ; Tucker - Davis Technologies ) , bandpass filtered 0 . 1 – 10 kHz with a 24 dB / octave roll - off ( Krohn - Hite model 3550 ) , digitized at 24 . 4 sam - ples / s ( RX6 multifunction processor ; Tucker - Davis Technologies ) , and monitored on - line via a digital oscilloscope and audio speaker . Custom data acquisition software displayed spike trains , isolated waveforms , and raster plots in real time . We analyzed raw waveforms off - line using cus - tom MATLAB scripts ( David Schneider and Sarah Woolley , Columbia University , New York , NY ) to ensure that only well isolated single units wereincludedinthedataset . Neuronswereassessedtobewellisolatedby thefollowingcriteria : ( 1 ) astablewaveformshape , ( 2 ) ahigh ( (cid:6) 4 ) signal - to - noise ratio , and ( 3 ) the absence of any interspike intervals (cid:7) 1 ms . The vast majority of recordings ( 71 of 77 ) met all three criteria . The remain - ing six recordings demonstrated the presence of two clearly separable 17598 • J . Neurosci . , December5 , 2012 • 32 ( 49 ) : 17597 – 17611 Carasetal . • EstradiolSelectivelyEnhancesAuditoryFunction waveforms with high signal - to - noise ratios . These waveforms were man - ually sorted off - line ; sorting efficacy was additionally verified by principal - components analysis . Band - limited white noise ( 0 . 25 – 8 kHz ) at 80 dB SPL was used as a search stimulus . Once a unit was well isolated , we presented song and tone stimuli , with the order of presentation randomized across cells . For song trials , we chose one song exemplar at random and presented it from 90to10dBSPLin10dBdescendingstepsatarateof0 . 14 / s . Werecorded 5 – 10trialsateachintensity . Fortonepresentations , weinitiallyestimated the characteristic frequency ( CF ) and best threshold of the unit on - line . We then presented a range of frequencies around the CF , in increments approximately equal to 10 % of the CF . Each frequency was presented from 90 to 10 dB SPL in 10 dB descending steps at a rate of 1 . 25 / s to construct the full response area of the unit . We recorded 5 – 10 trials for each frequency – intensity pair , with the order of frequency presentation randomized across trials . It should be noted that the stimulus intensities used here ( 10 – 90 dB SPL ) are similar to the sound amplitudes that would be experienced by free - living birds in the wild . Avian species are capable of singing at high intensities , with maximum values ranging from 74 to 105 dB SPL at 1 m ( Brackenbury , 1979 ; Brenowitz , 1982 ) , although some species can gen - erate song amplitudes as high as 111 . 5 dB SPL [ e . g . , the Screaming Piha ( Lipaugus vociferans ) ( Nemeth , 2004 ) ] . Therefore , we consider the stim - ulus levels used here to be within a normal , ethologically relevant range . Data analysis Tone responses . A unit was considered tone responsive if its average stimulus - evoked firing rate was significantly different ( Student’s paired t test , p (cid:7) 0 . 05 ) than its average spontaneous firing rate ( calculated from the 100 ms immediately preceding tone onset ) . The vast majority ( 54 of 56 ) of tone responses were excitatory . The remaining two cells ( one from a nonbreeding female , one from a breeding female ) gave what appeared to be postinhibitory rebound responses , as evidenced by strong excita - tionimmediatelyfollowingtoneoffset . Ifthesecellsweretrulyexhibiting postinhibitory rebound , their firing rates should be suppressed during tone presentation . The spontaneous firing rates of the cells were already quite low ( 1 . 48 and 1 . 67 spikes ( sp ) / s , respectively ) , however , making it difficult to detect a suppressive response . Because these potentially sup - pressiveresponsesweresorare , weremovedthemfromthetoneanalyses . Both of these cells did show suppressive responses to songs and were included in the song analyses ( see below , Song responses ) . To determine the pure - tone sensitivity of a unit , we measured the threshold for each stimulus frequency . Threshold was defined as the lowest intensity ( decibels SPL ) to elicit a significant response . An addi - tional criterion was that successively higher level stimuli must also elicit reliable responses . The CF was identified as the stimulus frequency with the lowest threshold . If multiple frequencies had the same ( lowest ) threshold , CF was defined as the stimulus with the greatest response strength ( RS ) at threshold . Here , we define RS as the difference between the average stimulus - evoked firing rate and the average spontaneous firing rate during the 100 ms immediately preceding tone onset , a win - dow equal to the duration of the tone . Wemeasuredthefrequencybandwidth10dBabovethebestthreshold of the neuron as an indicator of frequency tuning . In addition , we made the following measurements of the responses to the CF : First , we identi - fied the maximum average evoked firing rate , and the stimulus intensity that elicited the maximum response ( max decibels ) . Second , we set a noise floor 2 SDs above the baseline rate of the neuron . We then defined the firing rate range ( spikes per second ) of the neuron as the difference between the noise floor and the maximum evoked firing rate . Third , we calculated the dynamic range of the neuron , or the range of stimulus intensities within which a neuron is sensitive to differences in intensity . The dynamic range ( decibels SPL ) was calculated as the difference be - tween the max decibels and the threshold . During the early phases of our studies , it became clear that neuronal responses in field L could be either monotonically related to tone inten - sity at CF , or non - monotonic . Monotonic and non - monotonic neurons are thought to play different roles in auditory coding ( Polley et al . , 2006 ; Sadagopan and Wang , 2008 ; Watkins and Barbour , 2011 ) , raising the possibility that breeding condition might modulate each neuronal pop - ulation in a distinctive manner . We therefore chose to analyze mono - tonic and non - monotonic responses separately , as discussed below . To objectively determine whether a cell should be considered mono - tonic or non - monotonic , we set a boundary halfway between the noise floor and the maximum average evoked firing rate . A neuron was con - sidered non - monotonic if its average evoked firing rate dropped below this boundary at stimulus intensities above the decibel level that evoked the maximum firing rate . If the cell maintained a high evoked firing rate , staying above this boundary , it was considered monotonic ( see Fig . 2 ) . To determine whether these categorizations truly reflected two sepa - ratepopulationsofneurons , wecalculatedamonotonicityindex ( MI ) for each cell . The MI ranges from 0 to 1 , with increasing values indicative of increasing degrees of monotonicity . Similar measures of monotonicity have been used previously by other researchers ( Sutter and Schreiner , 1995 ; Recanzone et al . , 2000 ; de la Rocha et al . , 2008 ; Watkins and Bar - bour , 2011 ) . The MI was calculated for each cell as follows : MI (cid:1) Rate evokedathighestpure - toneamplitudepresented / maximumevokedrate of the neuron . In the majority of our cases ( 27 of 28 monotonic and 23 of 25non - monotonicneurons ) , thehighestpure - toneamplitudetestedwas 90 dB SPL . In the remaining three cases , the highest amplitude tested was 80 dB SPL . One non - monotonic neuron recorded in a breeding female had par - ticularly strong tone and song responses . To determine whether this cell was an outlier , we averaged tone and song - evoked (cid:1) RS (cid:1) values separately acrossstimuluslevelforeachnon - monotoniccellrecordedunderbreed - ingcondition . WeusedtheseaveragevaluestoperformDixon’s Q testfor outliers ( Dixon , 1950 ) . We found that the cell in question was an outlier at the 99th confidence interval ( Rorabacher , 1991 ) for both tone and song - evoked responses . We therefore removed this cell from all analyses . Song responses . To determine whether a unit was responsive to song , we first established a noise floor 2 SDs above and below the spontaneous rateoftheneuron . Foraunittobeconsideredsongresponsive , itsevoked firing rate had to fulfill the following criteria at a minimum of two con - secutivesongintensities : ( 1 ) surpassthenoisefloorand ( 2 ) bestatistically different ( Student’s paired t test , p (cid:7) 0 . 05 ) than the average spontaneous firing rate during the 2000 ms immediately preceding song onset , a win - dow approximately equal to the duration of each song stimulus . We found that these criteria reliably included units that were considered responsive by an experienced observer , while minimizing false positives . Two neurons clearly responded to song , but only at the highest stimulus intensity tested , and therefore could not meet the response criteria . An observer experienced in single - unit physiology blinded to the experi - mental conditions examined raster and poststimulus time histogram ( PSTH ) plots . A decision to include these cells in the analysis was made after this observer agreed that the neurons showed increased activity during song presentation . A unit’s song threshold ( decibels SPL ) was defined as the lowest of at least two consecutive intensities to elicit a significant response . We then identified the maximum average evoked firing rate ( for excitatory song responses ) , the minimum average evoked firing rate ( for suppressive song responses ) , and the stimulus intensity that elicited the maximum or minimum firing rate ( max or min decibels , respectively ) . We calculated the song dynamic range ( decibels SPL ) as the difference between max or min dB and the threshold . Finally , similar to tones , we used RS ( spikes per second ) as a measure of response magnitude . Songs elicited both excitatory and suppressive responses ( see Fig . 6 ) , however , which re - sultedinpositiveandnegativeRSvalues , respectively . Toanalyzeallsong responses as a whole , we used the absolute value of RS . Electrode track reconstruction Two injections of either 10 % Fluoro - Ruby ( 20 of 21 birds ) or 10 % BDA ( 1 of 21 birds ) were made at the end of each electrode penetra - tion to enable off - line reconstruction of recording sites . Fluoro - Ruby was injected iontophoretically through the recording pipette by using a current source ( BAB - 501 ; Kation Scientific ) set to (cid:8) 10 (cid:2) A for 1 min , followed by (cid:8) 4 (cid:2) A ( alternating 7 s on / off ) for 8 min . BDA was injected with 5 – 10 rapid 40 ms pulses of nitrogen gas at 20 psi using a picospritzer ( Parker ) . Carasetal . • EstradiolSelectivelyEnhancesAuditoryFunction J .

Parasagittal 40 (cid:2) m sections were cut on a freezing microtome and floated in 0 . 05 M PB . Sections were mounted onto gelatin - subbed slides and processed for Nissl ; alternates were air dried until fluorescent or BDA processing . Sections containing Fluoro - Ruby injections were cleared in xylene , coverslipped in DPX mounting medium ( Electron Microscopy Sci - ences ) , and dried overnight . Sections containing BDA injections were incubated in 30 % hydrogen peroxide in 100 % methanol , rehydrated in PBS , incubated in ABC ( Vector Laboratories ) , and visualized using DAB ( 3 (cid:9) , 3 - diaminobenzidine ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . All images were captured on a Olympus BH2 microscope fitted with a QImaging camera and QCap - ture software . Only units that could be localized unambiguously to field L were in - cluded in our analyses . It should be noted here that differences in spec - trotemporaltuninghavebeenreportedforthedifferentsubregionsofthefieldLcomplex ( Sen et al . , 2001 ; Nagel and Doupe , 2008 ; Kim and Doupe , 2011 ) , raising the possibility that E 2 has disparate effects on these different areas . There was insufficient statistical power to allow analysis by subregion , however , as our experimental design already consisted of multiple independent variables . We therefore did not separate our re - cording sites into anatomical subregions for our analysis . Hormone measurement Immediately before each recording session , we collected blood from the alar wing vein of each bird into a heparinized tube and centrifuged the sample at 4°C . Separated plasma was stored at (cid:10) 80°C until ELISA . Estra - diol levels were measured using a kit ( Cayman Chemicals ) that had not previously been used with this species , so the assay was first validated as described below . Multiple controls were used to assess the validity of the kit . First , plasma samples were pooled from multiple sparrows and stripped of steroids by incubating with dextran - coated charcoal in assay buffer ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . This stripped plasma is expected to contain no , or very low levels of estradiol . Second , stripped plasma was spiked with E 2 to 3200pg / mlandseriallydiluted .

These sam - ples are expected to differ in E 2 concentration by exactly 1000 pg / ml , and thus is a test of the precision of the kit . Finally , to determine whether lipids or proteins endogenous to white - crowned sparrow plasma inter - fere with the assay , hormones were extracted from all of the samples outlined above , reconstituted in assay buffer , and assayed separately . To extract hormones , anhydrous diethyl ether was added to each sam - ple aliquot and vortexed for 1 min . The ether fraction was pipetted into a new test tube , and the extraction was repeated for the remaining plasma layer . Ether fractions were combined for each sample and evaporated undernitrogengas . Dried , extractedhormonewasresuspendedinthekit assay buffer and samples were stored at 4°C until use . Results from the validation assay were as expected : stripped plasma contained extremely low levels of estradiol , serial dilutions paralleled the standard curve of the kit , and raw - spiked plasma differed from raw plasmaby (cid:3) 1000pg / ml . Nodramaticdifferenceswereobservedbetween extracted samples assayed in buffer and those assayed in raw plasma ; therefore , we did not extract hormone from experimental samples and instead assayed the raw plasma directly . We ran 50 (cid:2) l aliquots of each sample along with eight estrogen stan - dards ( 6 . 6 – 4000pg / ml ) inasingleassayfollowingtheprotocolofthekit . Some samples were lost during preparation ; therefore , only seven sam - ples were assayed for each experimental group . Most samples and all of the kit standards were run in duplicate ; however , three samples in each experimental group were run singly because of insufficient sample vol - ume . Briefly , weincubatedeachsamplewith50 (cid:2) lofE 2 antiserumand50 (cid:2) l of an E 2 - acetylcholinesterase conjugate for 1 h . After emptying and washing the plate , we added 200 (cid:2) l of enzymatic substrate ( Ellman’s reagent ) to all sample wells . After a 1 h incubation , we read the plate immediately at 405 nm on a Dynex MRX II microplate reader . We plotted the optical densities of the kit standards as a function of knownE 2 concentrationandfitthepointswithasigmoid4PLCequation ; sample hormone levels were extrapolated from this standard curve . In - traassay variability was 6 . 50 % . Statistics Monotonic and non - monotonic neurons were analyzed separately . To measure the effect of breeding condition on tone and song - evoked (cid:1) RS (cid:1) values , we set breeding condition as the between - subjects vari - able and stimulus level as the within - subject variable in two - way repeated - measures mixed - model ANOVAs . For some cells , we had an incomplete dataset , such that a given stimulus ( tone or song ) was only presented for a limited range of intensities . These missing values presented an obstacle for running a repeated - measures ANOVA . We therefore performed each ANOVA twice : In one version , we included all the cells in the dataset and discarded any stimulus level with missing values . In the other version , we discarded any cells that had missing values and included all the stimulus levels . Both of these versions gave similar results ; therefore , we report here only the results obtained when all cells were included in the ANOVAs . We used a Mann – Whitney U test to compare E 2 levels across experi - mentalconditions . Allcorrelations ( betweensongandtonethresholdsor between hormone levels and firing rates ) were assessed with Pearson’s r . For the remainder of our analyses , we indicate which statistical tests were used in table legends , or in Results , when appropriate . Unless otherwise stated , all values are reported as means (cid:4) SEMs . All statistical analyses were made using PASW Statistics 18 . 0 or GraphPad Prism . Results Plasma E 2 levels Females housed under breeding ( LD (cid:8) E 2 ) condition had elevated levels of plasma E 2 compared with females housed under non - breeding ( SD ) condition ( 397 . 8 (cid:4) 187 . 5 vs 26 . 3 (cid:4) 8 . 13 pg / ml ; Mann – Whitney U (cid:1) 1 . 000 ; n 1 (cid:1) n 2 (cid:1) 7 ; p (cid:1) 0 . 003 ) . Plasma E 2 levels in birds housed under breeding condition were similar to the physiological range reported by Wingfield and Farner ( 1978 ) for wild breeding female white - crowned sparrows ( (cid:3) 300 – 500 pg / ml ) . Auditory responses of field L neurons We recorded from a total of 77 auditory - responsive cells histo - logically confirmed to be in field L ( Fig . 1 C – E ) . Of these , 30 auditory cells were recorded from 9 birds in breeding condition and 47 cells were recorded from 12 birds in nonbreeding condi - tion ( Table 1 ) . For some cells , we were only able to record song responses ( either because the cell was unresponsive to tones , or because we could not hold the isolation long enough to record a full tone response area ) . Similarly , in another subset of cells , we were only able to record tone responses . We were able to record both song and tone responses in a final subset of cells . Tone responses Tone responses can be monotonic or non - monotonic Tone - responsive neurons in field L can be categorized as mono - tonic or non - monotonic , based on the shape of their rate level function . Monotonic neurons increase their firing rate with in - creasing stimulus intensities ( Fig . 2 A , C ) . Conversely , the firing rate of non - monotonic neurons increases up to some midlevel stimulus intensity before decreasing at higher intensities ( Fig . 2 B , D ) . We calculated a MI for each neuron to determine whether monotonic and non - monotonic cells were two separate popula - tions . The results of this analysis are shown in Figure 2 E . While there is a small amount of overlap between the two groups , the distributions clearly segregate from one another . Only 3 of 25 neurons classified as non - monotonic have MIs (cid:6) 0 . 70 . Each of these neurons had classic “inverted V” - shaped rate level func - tions , up through 80 dB SPL . At 90 dB SPL , each of these cells showed an increase in activity , such that their overall rate level function was “N” shaped . This “N” shape accounted for the high MI values in these cells . If the MI was instead calculated using 80 dB SPL as the maximum stimulus amplitude , each of these cells showed values of MI (cid:7) 0 . 70 . Similarly , only 2 of 28 cells that were classified as monotonic had values of MI (cid:7) 0 . 70 . Both of these cells showed rate level functions that saturated at midlevel intensities , with a small de - crease in firing rate at 90 dB SPL . This decrease , although not large enough for us to classify the cells as non - monotonic , ac - counts for the lower MI values . When we compared the groups using a two - sample t test , we found that monotonic neurons had significantly higher MIs than non - monotonic neurons ( 0 . 887 (cid:4) 0 . 025 vs 0 . 410 (cid:4) 0 . 054 ; t ( 51 ) (cid:1) 8 . 331 ; p (cid:7) 0 . 001 ) . Together , these findings suggest that the monotonic and non - monotonic cells we report on here likely comprise two distinct populations of neurons . Monotonic ( n (cid:1) 28 ) and non - monotonic ( n (cid:1) 25 ) cells were equally abundant in field L , and breeding condition had no effect Table1 .

Similarly , spike half - widths of monotonic and non - monotonic neurons remained stable across breeding conditions . These results are presented in more detail with their accompanying statistics in Table 2 . The anatomical positions of monotonic and non - monotonic neurons did not differ across the anterior – posterior and dorsal – ventral extents of field L . Individual recording sites overlapped along both the rostral – caudal and dorsal – ventral axes ( Fig . 3 ) , and breeding condition had no effect on the spatial distribution of monotonic or non - monotonic neurons ( Table 2 ) . Breeding condition does not affect CF distributions or frequency tuning Tone - responsive neurons in the avian auditory forebrain are tuned to specific frequencies arranged in a topographic manner ( Mu¨ller and Leppelsack , 1985 ; Wild et al . , 1993 ) . We investigated whether the CF distributions for monotonic and non - monotonic neurons differed between breeding conditions . Breeding condi - tion had no effect on the distribution of characteristic frequencies in monotonic or non - monotonic neurons . We also quantified tuning precision by calculating frequency bandwidths 10 dB above the best threshold of each neuron . No effect of breeding condition was observed on frequency bandwidths for monotonic or non - monotonic cells . Detailed results and accompanying sta - tistics can be found in Table 2 .

To determine whether E 2 has similar effects on field L neu - rons , a region that does not express steroid receptors , we calcu - lated average spontaneous and maximum evoked firing rates fromcellsinbirdsunderdifferentbreedingconditions ( Fig . 4 ) . E 2 treatment significantly increased spontaneous firing rates of monotonic neurons . Similarly , monotonic cells showed a trend toward an increase in maximum evoked firing rates at CF . Spon - taneous and maximum firing rates increased by the same relative amount , however , such that the firing rate range of these cells remained constant across breeding and nonbreeding conditions . Table 3 provides the statistical results of these comparisons . Figure 4 also illustrates that E 2 had different effects on non - monotonic neurons . While breeding condition did not have a significant effect on spontaneous firing rates of non - monotonic neurons , E 2 treatment significantly decreased maximum evoked firing rates of these cells . This combination resulted in a significant decrease in the firing rate range of non - monotonic neurons . The associated statistics for these comparisons are listed in Table 3 . Breeding condition increases tone - evoked response strength and sensitivity of monotonic neurons The effects of E 2 on maximum evoked firing rates could be ex - plained by an overall shift in evoked firing rates across stimulus levels , and / or a change in the shape of the rate level function , both of which could give rise to changes in auditory thresholds and dynamic ranges . To address this issue , we calculated RS level functions at CF for monotonic and non - monotonic neurons un - der different breeding conditions . Figure 5 A shows group RS data for monotonic neurons across stimulus level ; accompanying statistical results are listed in Table 4 . Input – output functions had similar shapes across experimen - tal conditions , peaking at 80 dB SPL under breeding condition and 90 dB SPL under nonbreeding condition . The effect of sound intensity was significant . In addition , breeding condition signif - icantly increased monotonic tone RS values across levels , by an average of 9 . 08 sp / s . The interaction between breeding condition and tone intensity on monotonic tone RS was also significant , such that the largest differences between the experimental groups occurred at midlevel intensities . Table 4 shows the accompanying statistics for this analysis . The effect of breeding condition on overall response magni - tude resulted in differences in auditory sensitivity . Breeding con - dition significantly lowered CF thresholds compared with nonbreeding condition in monotonic cells ( Fig . 5 C ) . The E 2 - induced decrease in threshold contributed to a slight , but non - significant increase in monotonic neuron dynamic range ( Fig . 5 E ) . The statistics for these comparisons can be found in Table 3 . Figure 5 B shows group RS data for non - monotonic neurons across stimulus level . As above , input – output functions for breeding and nonbreeding groups had similar shapes , peaking at 60 and 50 dB SPL , respectively , and the overall effect of sound level was significant . In contrast to the monotonic neurons , breeding condition significantly decreased tone RS values in non - monotonic neurons across stimulus levels by an average of 5 . 76 sp / s . The interaction term between level and breeding condition was not significant and no effect was found on CF threshold ( Fig . 5 D ) or on dynamic ranges ( Fig . 5 F ) in these cells . The results of these statistical analyses can be found in Tables 3 and 4 .

Song responses of field L neurons Song responses can be excitatory or suppressive Previous work has shown an effect of E 2 treatment on selectivity and discrimination of conspecific song stimuli in secondary au - ditory forebrain regions ( Maney et al . , 2006 ; Tremere et al . , 2009 ; Remage - Healey et al . , 2010 , 2012 ; Sanford et al . , 2010 ; Tremere and Pinaud , 2011 ; Remage - Healey and Joshi , 2012 ) . All of these studies presented song at a single intensity level , however . There - fore , before determining whether E 2 affects field L song response properties , we first examined song - evoked rate level functions in individualcells . Weobservedthat , whilethemajority ( 40of58 ) of responses to conspecific song were excitatory ( Fig . 6 A , C ) , in - creasingtheirrateasafunctionofsonglevel , asubstantialportion of them ( 18 of 58 ) were suppressive ( Fig . 6 B , D ) . Breeding con - dition did not influence the relative proportions of excitatory or suppressive song responses in field L ( Table 5 ) . To determine whether breeding condition affects song - evoked excitability , we calculated the maximum song - evoked (cid:1) RS (cid:1) for each cell ; we found no effect of breeding condition ( Table 5 ) . Breeding condition increases song - evoked response strength and dynamic range of cells with monotonic tone responses We used the absolute value of response strength ( (cid:1) RS (cid:1) ) to analyze the change in neuronal firing rate for all song responses together . Song (cid:1) RS (cid:1) values increased as a function of song level in both breeding and nonbreeding groups ( F ( 4 , 56 ) (cid:1) 14 . 46 ; p (cid:7) 0 . 001 ) . E 2 treatment , however , did not significantly affect rate level shapes or magnitudes ( F ( 1 , 56 ) (cid:1) 0 . 075 ; p (cid:1) 0 . 785 ) , and no interaction between breeding condition and song level was observed ( F ( 4 , 56 ) (cid:1) 0 . 313 ; p (cid:1) 0 . 870 ) . As noted in Table 5 , breeding and nonbreeding groupsalsohadsimilarsongthresholdsanddynamicranges .

Song thresholds were higher than tone thresholds . This finding is not surprising , given that tone thresholds were measured at CF , the optimal tonal stimulus of the unit . The correlation between song and tone thresholds led us to predict that E 2 treatment enhances song responses , but only in neurons with monotonic input – output functions in response to pure - tone stimuli . To examine this issue , we examined song - evoked (cid:1) RS (cid:1) level functions separately for cells that had mono - tonic and non - monotonic tone input – output functions . For cells that had monotonic tone responses , there was a significant effect ofsoundintensityonaveragesong - evoked (cid:1) RS (cid:1) valuesunderboth breeding and nonbreeding conditions ( Fig . 8 A ) . E 2 treatment significantlyincreasedsong - evoked (cid:1) RS (cid:1) valuesinthesecellsbyan average of 2 . 578 sp / s across levels . Importantly , there was a sig - nificant interaction between song intensity and breeding condi - tion ; while breeding condition had a small impact at even at the lowest intensity tested , this effect became more pronounced as song intensity increased . The greatest difference between condi - tions was observed at 90 dB SPL . Because the greatest shift in the input – output function occurred at higher stimulus levels , there was no significant change in song threshold ( Fig . 8 C ) . In addi - tion , there was a trend for breeding condition to increase song dynamic range in cells with monotonic tone responses ( Fig . 8 E ) , but this trend failed to achieve statistical significance . The results of these statistical analyses can be found in Tables 3 and 4 . Average song - evoked (cid:1) RS (cid:1) values are plotted as a function of sound level for cells that had non - monotonic tone responses in Figure 8 B . In these cells , the effect of level was not signifi - cant . E 2 treatment did not significantly alter (cid:1) RS (cid:1) values across sound intensity , nor was there a significant interaction be - tween song intensity and breeding condition ( Table 4 ) . Fi - nally , breeding condition did not have a significant effect on song thresholds ( Fig . 8 D ) or song dynamic ranges ( Fig . 8 F ) in cells that had non - monotonic tone responses ( see Table 3 for associated statistics ) . In summary , breeding condition increased song - evoked re - sponse strengths and dynamic ranges in neurons with mono - tonic tone responses , but not neurons with non - monotonic tone responses . Plasma E 2 concentrations predict firing rates and response strengths The observations that breeding condition influenced auditory response properties in a select subset of field L neurons ( Figs . 4 , 5 , 8 ) led us to ask whether plasma E 2 concentrations in individual birds correlate with single - unit firing rates or response strengths . To address this question , we compared the response properties of neurons from individual animals with the circulating level of plasma E 2 . As shown in Figure 9 , plasma E 2 concentrations were positively and significantly correlated with spontaneous firing rates ( r (cid:1) 0 . 71 ; n (cid:1) 18 ; p (cid:7) 0 . 001 ) and maximum evoked firing rates ( r (cid:1) 0 . 66 ; n (cid:1) 18 ; p (cid:1) 0 . 003 ) of monotonic neurons ( Fig . 9 A ) . Plasma E 2 concentrations did not correlate with either spon - taneous or evoked firing rates in non - monotonic cells ( Fig . 9 B ) . Similarly , while systemic E 2 levels positively predicted both tone - evoked ( Fig . 9 C ) and song - evoked ( Fig . 9 D ) response strengths in cells with monotonic rate level functions to pure tones , there was no correlation between E 2 and response strengths in cells with non - monotonic tone rate level functions ( Fig . 9 E , F ) . The re - sponse strengths shown in Figure 9 C – F were all elicited at 50 dB Table3 .

Thus , spontaneous firing rates , maximum firing rates , and sound - evoked response strengths of monotonic , but not non - monotonic neurons , are all modulated by plasma E 2 in a dose - dependent manner . Discussion Hormonal regulation of auditory processing in the CNS The influence of sex steroid hormones on central auditory pro - cessing has received considerable attention , particularly for its clinical relevance . The latency of auditory brainstem responses ( ABRs ) change across the menstrual cycle and after hormone replacement therapy in adult women ( Al - Mana et al . , 2008 , 2010 ) . In addition , sound localization is impaired in women with Turner’s syndrome , a chromosomal abnormality that results in estrogen deficiency ( Hederstierna et al . , 2009 ) . Recent work in both humans and rodents has demonstrated that ERs are ex - pressed widely in the mammalian auditory system , including au - ditory cortex ( Stenberg et al . , 2001 ; Charitidi et al . , 2010 ; Tremere et al . , 2011 ) . Whether plasma hormones affect the response prop - erties of single neurons in the mammalian auditory cortex , how - ever , is currently unknown . One group has reported that mouse cortical multiunit responses to pup isolation calls differ between mothersandvirgins , buttherelativecontributionsofhormonalstate and pup care experience cannot be separated in these experiments , andthesetwovariablesmayinteract ( MirandaandLiu , 2009 ) . Inthe current study , we demonstrate that single - unit auditory function in the telencephalon of an avian species is modulated by circulating reproductive hormones in a dose - dependent manner . Together , these findings highlight the need for detailed neurophysiological investigations of the mammalian auditory cortex under carefully controlled hormonal conditions . The majority of work investigating hormonal modulation of central auditory function focuses on the rapid action of brain - derived E 2 to increase neuronal responsiveness in the songbird nucleus NCM ( Pinaud and Tremere , 2012 ) . NCM is a secondary nucleus downstream of field L and is specialized for conspecific Table5 .

In ze - bra finches , direct infusion of E 2 into NCM increases single - unit evoked firing rates both locally in NCM and down - stream in HVC ( Tremere et al . , 2009 ; Remage - Healey et al . , 2010 ; Tremere and Pinaud , 2011 ; Remage - Healey and Joshi , 2012 ) . Here , we report that E 2 increases neuronal responsiveness in the primary auditory forebrain , indicating that the central effects of sex steroids are not lim - ited to higher processing regions , but ex - tend more generally within the auditory pathway . Surprisingly , the influence of sex steroids on auditory thresholds has never been assessed at a single - unit or multiunit level in the telencephalon . We show that monotonic field L cells have lower pure - tone thresholds and expanded song dy - namic ranges under breeding condition . These results indicate that hormones do not simply modulate specialized forebrain processing tasks , such as neural song se - lectivity or discrimination . Instead , E 2 also modulates fundamental aspects of auditory forebrain function across a wide range of stimulus intensities . Cellular basis of E 2 modulation of field L neurons In NCM , blockade of ERs decreases neu - ronal activity ( Tremere et al . , 2009 ; Tremere and Pinaud , 2011 ) , suggesting that E 2 influences neuronal responses by binding directly to ERs . Field L does not express classical ERs ( Jeong et al . , 2011 ; Maney and Pinaud , 2011 ) , and expresses little to no GPR30 ( a nonclassical ER ) in adulthood ( Acharya and Veney , 2012 ) , but demonstrates a clear sensitivity to E 2 . Here , we discuss multiple possibilities for the cellular basis underlying estrogenic modulation of field L neurons . One possibility is that E 2 directly mod - ulates activity in an area upstream of field L that contains ERs . In songbirds , ERs are absent in the auditory thalamus and mid - brain ( Gahr et al . , 1993 ; Gahr , 2001 ) . While no systematic study has examined ER expression in the songbird auditory brainstem , ER (cid:5) is expressed in three chicken brainstem nuclei : magnocellu - laris , angularis , and laminaris ( Y . Wang and E . W . Rubel , unpub - lished observations ) . Additionally , ER (cid:5) is expressed in hair cells and support cells of the zebra finch inner ear ( Noirot et al . , 2009 ) , and in the cochlear ganglion of Gambel’s white - crowned spar - rows ( Y . Wang , E . A . Brenowitz , and E . W . Rubel , unpublished observations ) . All of these auditory regions are possible candi - dates for direct estrogenic influence . Similarly , field L activity may be modulated by descending input from efferent regions that express ERs . Field L’s only known source of top – down input is from the caudolateral meso - pallium ( Vates et al . , 1996 ; Reiner et al . , 2004 ) ( Fig . 1 B ) , a sec - ondary auditory region that lacks ER expression ( Gahr , 1990 , 2001 ; Gahr et al . , 1993 ; Metzdorf et al . , 1999 ) . E 2 modulation could be initiated instead in brain regions that are indirectly con - nected with field L . NCM , which expresses ERs ( Bernard et al . , 1999 ; Gahr , 2001 ; Saldanha and Coomaralingam , 2005 ; Jeong et al . , 2011 ; Maney and Pinaud , 2011 ) , is reciprocally connected to field L via three synapses , which pass through the medial and lateral portions of the caudal mesopallium ( Fig . 1 B ) . Addition - ally , the cup of the robust nucleus of the arcopallium is auditory responsive ( MelloandClayton , 1994 ) andmayexpressERs ( Gahr et al . , 1993 ) . The cup sends projections to the shell of nucleus ovoidalis ( Mello et al . , 1998 ) , which provides input into field L ( Bonke et al . , 1979 ; Vates et al . , 1996 ) . None of these pathways can be ruled out at this time . Another possibility is that E 2 modulates field L activity via monaminergic signaling . The songbird auditory system receives catecholaminergic innervation and these inputs are sensitive to hormonal state ( Maney and Pinaud , 2011 ) . For example , sex ste - Figure 9 . Plasma E 2 concentration predicts monotonic neuron firing rates and response strengths .

In female white - throated sparrows ( a con - gener to the white - crowned sparrow ) , systemic E 2 increases the number of catecholaminergic cells in locus ceruleus ( LeBlanc et al . , 2007 ) and increases the density of monoaminergic fibers in the auditory midbrain and forebrain ( Matragrano et al . , 2011 , 2012 ) . Furthermore , monoamines modulate songbird auditory forebrain physiology ( Dave et al . , 1998 ; Shea and Margoliash , 2003 ; Cardin and Schmidt , 2004 ) and behavioral responses to song playback ( Appeltants et al . , 2002 ; Riters and Pawlisch , 2007 ; Vyas et al . , 2009 ; Pawlisch et al . , 2011 ) . Future experiments should test whether intact monoamine signaling is necessary to mediate the effects of systemic E 2 on field L neurons . Dose - responsive effects of E 2 on central sensory physiology Few studies have addressed whether the effects of circulating E 2 on central sensory physiology scale with hormone concentration in a graded manner or are exerted in an all - or - none fashion once hormone levels reach some critical level ( Oshima and Gorbman , 1969 ) . Here , we demonstrate that in monotonic neurons , firing rates and response strengths gradually increase with increasing plasma E 2 . These findings suggest that individual auditory re - sponsiveness is maximal when plasma E 2 is highest ( during courtship and copulation ) ( Wingfield and Farner , 1978 ) and is less sensitive at other times during the breeding season , when intersex communication may be less important . Given the meta - bolic cost of increased neural activity ( Niven and Laughlin , 2008 ) , a graded hormonal effect may serve to reduce unnecessary energy expenditure postmating , when other behaviors associated with the breeding season ( e . g . , feeding young , molting ) occur . Cell - specific effect of E 2 We found that E 2 has robust effects on monotonic auditory func - tion while leaving non - monotonic cell processing unchanged . While the precise roles of monotonic and non - monotonic cells in auditory coding are still a matter of speculation , several hypoth - eses have been proposed . One of these hypotheses , the level tol - erance model , suggests that non - monotonic neurons maintain sound source identity over a wide range of intensities , allowing the frequency content of a complex stimulus to be encoded by neuronal firing rates without the confounding influence of stim - ulus level ( Sadagopan and Wang , 2008 ) . If this model is true , then our findings suggest that E 2 may enhance sound responses in monotonic neurons to allow better signal detection in the breed - ing season , while the stability of non - monotonic cells might en - sure that signal identity remains constant under variable listening conditions . Maintaining a consistent representation of sounds across seasons could be important for the accurate recognition of species or individuals within a flock . Disparate effects of E 2 within auditory pathway In a previous study , systemic E 2 treatment elevated ABR thresh - olds in female white - crowned sparrows ( Caras et al . , 2010 ) . This result seems to contradict the findings presented here . To recon - cile this apparent discrepancy , it is important to note a few im - portant differences between the studies . First , the ABR is a population response , generated by electrical activity in the audi - tory nerve and brainstem ( Hall , 2007 ) . Because no particular pure - tone frequency will elicit an optimal response in all neurons contributing to the ABR , the threshold is actually a measurement of sensitivity to a suboptimal stimulus . Conversely , in the current study , we calculated threshold at the optimal stimulus of an in - dividual neuron : its CF . Furthermore , because the ABR is a pooled response recorded far - field ( Jewett et al . , 1970 ; Jewett and Williston , 1971 ) , it is better described as a measure of neural synchrony , as opposed to firing rate . It is therefore difficult to compare the two measurements directly . Regardless of the meth - odologicaldifferencesbetweenthetwostudies , thepossibilitystill remains that sex steroids have heterogeneous effects on separate portions of the ascending auditory system . This divergence could be explained by differences in hormone receptor expression pat - terns or mechanisms of hormonal action , as discussed above .
