HS1 , the hematopoietic ho - molog of cortactin , binds to Arp2 / 3 complex and promotes actin assembly by helping to form and stabilize actin filament branches . We investigated the role of HS1 in transendothe - lial migration ( TEM ) by NK cells . Depletion of HS1 led to a decrease in the efficiency of TEM by NK cells , as measured by transwell assays with endothelial cell monolayers on porous fil - ters . Transwell assays involve chemotaxis of NK cells across the filter , so to examine TEM more specifically , we imaged live - cell preparations and antibody - stained fixed preparations , with and without the chemoattractant SDF - 1 α . We found small to moderate effects of HS1 depletion on TEM , including whether the NK cells migrated via the transcellular or paracellu - lar route . Expression of HS1 mutants indicated that phosphorylation of HS1 tyrosines at po - sitions 222 , 378 and 397 was required for rescue in the transwell assay , but HS1 mutations affecting interaction with Arp2 / 3 complex or SH3 - domain ligands had no effect . The GEF Vav1 , a ligand of HS1 phosphotyrosine , influenced NK cell transendothelial migration . HS1 and Vav1 also affected the speed of NK cells migrating across the surface of the endotheli - um . We conclude that HS1 has a role in transendothelial migration of NK cells and that HS1 tyrosine phosphorylation may signal through Vav1 . Introduction Leukocytes leave the vasculature as part of inflammatory and immune responses . They are re - cruited to a site of inflammation through a series of steps including capture , rolling , activation , and adhesion , which culminates in migration through the endothelium , termed transendothe - lial migration ( TEM ) [ 1 ] . The route for TEM may be between endothelial cells ( paracellular ) or directly through one endothelial cell ( transcellular ) [ 2 , 3 ] . The paracellular route involves con - trolled loosening of endothelial cell - cell junctions , creating a space for the leukocyte to travel .

The funders had no role in study design , data collection and analysis , decision to publish , or preparation of the manuscript . Competing Interests : The authors have declared that no competing interests exist . The transcellular route requires exquisite control of membrane trafficking , because the endo - thelial cell creates a channel for the leukocyte while preserving the integrity of its plasma mem - brane . In both cases , the leukocyte generally squeezes itself through a relatively small hole and passes quickly from one side of the endothelium to the other . Molecular and cellular analysis of TEM has revealed critical roles for cell adhesion mole - cules , membrane trafficking and recycling components , and the actin cytoskeleton , under the control of several signaling cascades [ 4 ] . Among endothelial cell molecules , ICAM - 1 ( intercel - lular adhesion molecule - 1 ) and VCAM - 1 ( vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ) are involved in adhesion of the leukocyte to the endothelial surface through interaction with leukocyte integ - rins , leading to formation of a “ docking structure ” for the leukocyte [ 5 ] . Other membrane - asso - ciated molecules , including PECAM - 1 ( CD31 ) , CD99 , ICAM - 2 , and JAM family members , play important functional roles in leukocyte transmigration [ 4 ] . Leukocytes also have impor - tant roles during transendothelial migration [ 4 ] . Activation of integrin is required for leuko - cytes to adhere firmly and extend processes over the surface of the endothelium . β 2 and β 1 integrins ( e . g . CD11a / CD18 , CD11b / CD18 and VLA - 4 ) are the primary ones involved [ 6 ] . Natural killer cells ( NK cells ) are large granular lymphocytes and critical components of in - nate immunity [ 7 , 8 ] , providing resistance to infection and cancer . They response rapidly to im - mune signals , recognizing target cells in the absence of antibodies and MHC class 1 protein . NK cells are distinct from T and B lymphocytes in surface phenotype , target recognition , and function . They lack TCR complex ( CD3 ) expression , and they express N - CAM ( CD56 ) and Fc δ RIII ( CD16 ) in humans [ 9 ] . NK cells also participate in the adaptive immune response , by secreting cytokines and chemokines and by processing antigens [ 10 ] . Migration of NK cells to a site of inflammation is initiated by environmental signals , which lead to adhesive interactions between NK cells and vascular endothelial cells , resulting in attachment and transmigration across the endothelium layer [ 9 , 11 ] . NK cells express a number of cell - surface molecules re - sponsible for responding to chemotactic stimuli , binding to the endothelium and TEM [ 12 , 13 ] . NK cell actions during transmigration involve receptor - mediated signaling and cytoskele - ton - based processes . HS1 ( hematopoietic lineage cell - specific protein 1 ) can link signaling cascades and actin assembly with generation of force and movement [ 14 ] . HS1 is the hemato - poietic homolog of cortactin , a prominent Src substrate , which regulates actin dynamics during leading edge formation , invadopodia formation and cell invasion [ 15 ] . Cortactin and HS1 bind to Arp2 / 3 complex and to actin filaments to stabilize branching networks of actin filaments . HS1 contributes to formation of lamellipodia and podosomes , and it regulates T - cell signaling [ 16 – 18 ] . Tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 plays critical roles in lymphocyte trafficking , antigen - re - ceptor induced T - cell and B - cell signaling and apoptosis [ 19 , 20 ] . Phosphorylation of HS1 can regulate its interaction with other proteins such as the GEF Vav1 [ 14 ] . HS1 is a substrate of Syk and Src family kinases . Syk phosphorylation of HS1 on Tyr378 and Tyr397 generates high - af - finity binding sites for SH2 - domain - containing proteins , which can lead to HS1 tyrosine phos - phorylation at position 222 by Src family kinases [ 21 ] . In neutrophils , HS1 phosphorylation events on Tyr222 , Tyr378 , and Tyr397 are required for efficient chemotaxis and for binding of HS1 to Arp2 / 3 complex [ 22 ] . In NK cells , HS1 depletion impairs the formation of lytic synap - ses and cytolytic activity [ 14 ] . HS1 tyrosine phosphorylation at position 397 is important for adhesion of integrins to ICAM - 1 , lytic synapse formation and cytolytic activity , while phos - phorylation of HS1 Tyr378 is important for chemotaxis [ 14 ] . HS1 contains an N - terminal Arp2 / 3 - binding region , a repeat region that binds F - actin , a proline - rich region and a C - terminal SH3 domain . Cortactin can synergize with WASp family members to activate Arp2 / 3 complex [ 23 – 25 ] , based on the fact that Arp2 / 3 complex has two binding sites for acidic / DDW regions [ 26 , 27 ] , such as the one found at the N - terminus of HS1 and Transendothelial Migration of NK Cells PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0118153 February 27 , 2015 2 / 23 cortactin and HS1 . The proline - rich region and SH3 domain are important for binding to Vav1 , a member of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEF ) , and to the WIP / WASp heterodimer , which associate with numerous signaling molecules involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation [ 20 ] . Here we investigated whether and how HS1 contributes to the process of transendothelial migration by the NK cell . We tested endothelial and NK cell preparations in the presence and absence of a chemoattractant . We used live - cell movies to watch the migration of NK cells over the surface of endothelial monolayers and to follow their movement through the monolayer . Computer - assisted tracking of cell movements and non - parametric statistics of large non - Gaussian data sets facilitated the analysis . We also used conventional transwell assays and staining of fixed preparations . We investigated the importance of HS1 ’ s phosphorylated tyro - sine residues , as well as the role of the SH2 - containing GEF Vav1 , which interacts with phos - pho - HS1 . Materials and Methods Chemicals and reagents were obtained from Fisher Scientific ( Pittsburgh , PA ) or Sigma - Al - drich ( Saint Louis , MO ) , unless stated otherwise . Cell Culture Cells were cultured at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . Human NK - 92 cells ( ATCC CRL2407 ) were obtained from ATCC ( Manassas , VA ) and cultured in α - Minimum Essential Medium ( MEM ) base me - dium supplemented with 12 . 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 12 . 5 % horse serum , myo - inositol , folic acid , β - mercaptoethanol ( β - ME ) , interleukin 2 ( IL - 2 ) and penicillin / streptomycin , ac - cording to ATCC recommendations for complete growth medium . Human dermal microvas - cular endothelial cells ( HDMVECs ) were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Endothelial Growth Basal Medium ( EBM ) - 2 base medium supplemented with the Microvascular Endothe - lial Cell Growth Medium - 2 ( EGM - 2 MV ) kit with FBS from Lonza ( Allendale , NJ ) . Soft Substrate Preparation 20 - mm glass - bottom culture dishes ( MatTek , Ashland , MA ) were coated with aminosilane and activated by treatment with 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde for 30 min . Polyacrylamide with 0 . 4 % bis - ac - rylamide was prepared as described [ 28 ] . 20 μ L of the acrylamide mixture was placed onto an activated cover slip in a glass - bottom dish , and an 18 - mm coverslip was placed on top . The ac - rylamide was allowed to polymerize for 30 min at RT , the top coverslip was removed , and the gel was washed with PBS . Cloning and Mutagenesis HS1 cDNA was obtained from Origene ( NM _ 005335 . 3 ) and cloned into the Td - tomato N1 ex - pression vector ( gift of Dr . Paul Bridgman , Washington University ) at EcoR1 and AgeI restric - tion sites . Point mutations were introduced into the HS1 expression plasmid by site - directed mutagenesis ( QuikChange Kit , Agilent , Santa Clara , CA ) . First , wild - type ( WT ) and siRNA - re - sistant ( 2 , 3 - Res ) HS1 expression plasmids were constructed . Next , individual tyrosine residues were mutated to phenylalanine . Other constructs included a triple point mutant affecting the Arp2 / 3 - binding site , with amino acid residues 18 to 21 changed from DDW to AAA , and an SH3 - domain mutant , with amino acid residue 466 Trp changed to Lys .

HS1 and Transendothelial Migration of NK Cells PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0118153 February 27 , 2015 3 / 23 Antibodies and Immunofluorescence MatTek dishes were coated overnight at 4°C with ICAM - 1 ( 12 . 5 μ g / mL with 100 μ L per 10 - mm well ) . NK cells were treated with 10 μ M PMA ( phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ) for 30 min , added to ICAM - 1 - coated MatTek dishes ( 1 x 10 5 cells per well ) and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C to allow cells to attach to the glass surface . Cells were fixed and permeabilized in one step , using 4 % PFA ( paraformaldehye ) with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 10 min . After being washed with PBS , cells were blocked with 5 % BSA in PBS and then incubated with primary and secondary antibodies diluted in 3 % BSA in PBS . ProLong Gold ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) was used as the mounting agent . Primary antibodies included rabbit anti - human HS1 ( D83A8 ) , rabbit anti - human phospho - Tyr397 HS1 , rabbit anti - human VE - cadherin ( all from Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA ) and mouse anti - human ICAM - 1 / CD54 ( monoclonal antibody BBIG - I1 , R & D Systems ) . Secondary antibodies were Alexa - fluor conjugates ( Invitrogen ) . Alexa - fluor conjugated phal - loidin was used for F - actin . Assay for Route of Transendothelial Migration MatTek dishes , with or without polyacrylamide gel , were coated with 10 μ g / mL fibronectin in PBS and incubated overnight at 4°C . HDMVEC cells were added and allowed to form a mono - layer . After overnight treatment with TNF α ( 20 ng / mL ) , the HDMVEC monolayer was washed with HDMVEC media containing 30 ng / mL SDF - 1 α ( stromal cell - derived factor alpha ) , pre - warmed to 37°C . After several minutes , the SDF - 1 α - containing medium was removed , and NK cells ( 1 x 10 5 NK cells in 1 mL NK cell media ) were added onto the HDMVEC monolayer . After incubation for 2 hrs at 37°C , the preparation was fixed and immunostained as described above . This assay was also performed without the chemotactic factor SDF - 1 α . In this case , NK cells were incubated with the HDMVEC monolayer for 25 min at 37°C . Table 1 .

Scrambled siRNA was used as a negative control . Each sample included 30 pmol siRNA and 2 – 3 x 10 6 cells . Levels of HS1 knockdown in cell lysates were tested by anti - HS1 immunoblot after 72 hrs , with GAPDH as a loading control . HS1 expression plasmids were transfected into NK cells by nucleofection using the same nucleofector kit ( up to 2 μ g of DNA per sample ) . To express exogenous HS1 protein while knocking down endogenous HS1 , we cotransfected an siRNA - resistant HS1 ex - pression plasmid with the HS1 - targeting siRNA . For siRNA 2 , codon - neutral mutations were introduced by site - directed mutagenesis , as indicated in lowercase : GAGTaGAaaGAGAcC - GAAT . The target sequence of siRNA3 , CGGGAAAGTACGTCTAGAT , was in the 3 ’ UTR , so no expression - plasmid mutations were necessary . To confirm the results with siRNA , we targeted HS1 with shRNA expressed from a pLKO . 1 plasmid ( pBJ 2122 ) . The targeting sequence , termed HS1 - 05 , was GACACAGATCCT - GACTTTG . A control non - hairpin shRNA sequence in the same expression vector served as a negative control ( pBJ 2121 ) . To exclude off - target effects , the targeting construct was rescued by expression of a tdTomato - HS1 fusion made resistant to HS1 - 05 by the following codon - neutral point mutations ( lowercase ) : GAtACtGATCCaGACTTcG ( pBJ 2089 ) . The expression plasmid was transfected into NK cells by nucleofection using Amaxa cell line nucleofector kit R . For rescue experiments , the shRNA - resistant tdTomato - HS1 expression plasmid was co - transfected with the shRNA expression plasmid . For Vav1 , a set of four siRNAs ( Dharmacon SMARTpooI ON - TARGETplus VAV1 siRNA ) was used , as described previously [ 29 , 30 ] . Immunoblots documented decreased levels of Vav1 protein . Levels of Expression of HS1 Mutants To test for levels of expression of HS1 mutants in HS1 - knockdown cells , 15 x 10 6 cells ( five cu - vettes of 3 x 10 6 each ) were transfected using Amaxa nucleofector kit R . Each cuvette had a total volume of 100 μ L , 25 pmol each of HS1 siRNA oligonucleotides 2 and 3 , and 2 μ g of siRNA - resistant tdTomato - HS1 , wild - type or mutant . The amounts were optimized for trans - fection efficiency in pilot experiments . After 72 hrs , tdTomato - positive cells were selected by flow cytometry sorting . Cells were lysed in 1 % NP - 40 lysis buffer with the protease inhibitors PMSF , aprotinin , and leupeptin and the phosphatase inhibitor sodium ortho - vanadate . Cell ly - sates were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblots . Transwell Migration Assay To assay chemotaxis and transendothelial migration by NK cells , we used transwell chambers ( Corning ) with 8 - μ m pore - size inserts . The upper chamber was coated with 10 μ g / mL fibro - nectin in PBS overnight at 4°C and washed with PBS . HDMVEC cells were plated on the filter by adding 0 . 2 to 0 . 3 x 10 5 cells in 100 μ L HDMVEC medium . Medium ( 600 μ L ) was added to the bottom chamber . After 24 hrs , the medium was replaced with HDMVEC medium contain - ing TNF α ( 20 ng / mL , 100 μ L in the top chamber and 600 μ L in the bottom chamber ) . After in - cubation for 18 hrs , NK cells ( 2 x 10 5 cells in 100 μ L NK cell medium ) were added to the endothelial monolayer . NK cells were pretreated by transfection with siRNA targeting HS1 or Vav1 or with siRNA targeting HS1 plus the siRNA - resistant HS1 expression plasmid . For chemotactic migration assays , the medium in the bottom chamber was replaced with medium containing SDF - 1 α ( 30 ng / mL ) . The chambers were incubated for 4 hrs to allow for transmigration . NK cells were HS1 and Transendothelial Migration of NK Cells PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0118153 February 27 , 2015 5 / 23 collected from the bottom chamber , suspended in 100 μ L PBS and counted using a hemocy - tometer . To test for adequacy of monolayer formation in each transwell apparatus , the filter membrane was excised and fixed and stained with fluorescent phalloidin and anti - VE - cad - herin . Results were included only from those transwells where a complete monolayer was ob - served , without gaps . Live - Cell Imaging We performed live - cell imaging of NK cell migration in preparations with and without treat - ment by the chemoattractant SDF - 1 α . For experiments with chemoattractant , HDMVEC monolayers were formed on glass - bottom culture dishes ( 14 mm , Cat . # P35G - 1 . 5 - 14 - C , Mat - Tek , Ashland , MA ) previously coated with fibronectin ( 10 μ g / mL ) in PBS overnight at 4°C . HDMVECs ( 1 x 10 5 ) in HDMVEC medium were added to each dish and placed in culture overnight . The monolayers were treated with TNF α ( 20 ng / mL ) overnight . During the same time period , NK cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting HS1 and / or Vav1 for 72 hrs . The endothelial monolayer was washed with HDMVEC medium containing 30 ng / mL SDF - 1 α , pre - warmed to 37°C . After several minutes , the SDF - 1 α - containing medium was re - moved , and siRNA - treated NK cells were added to the monolayer and incubated for 1 hr . Prep - arations were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with a 40X 1 . 2 NA objective and an environmental chamber . DIC images were captured for 1 hr at 1 - min intervals as a stack of three z - axis focal planes ( 1 μ m thick ) , which included the endothelial surface and the NK cells . Maximum intensity projections of the z - axis focal planes were used to observe and measure the rate of NK cell migration on the endothelial monolayer . To observe the migration of NK cells in the absence of SDF - 1 α stimulation , the methods were similar , with minor differences . Glass - bottom culture dishes were coated with 15 μ g / mL fibronectin overnight and washed with cold PBS . To capture live cell images , HDMVEC medi - um was replaced with NK cell medium , the culture dish was placed on the incubator stage , and an area of the endothelial monolayer without gaps was identified . NK cells ( 1 x 10 5 ) were added , and images were captured immediately after the cells settled down onto the endothelial monolayer . Images were collected every 20 s for 1 hr , with a 10X objective . We used a spin - ning - disc confocal microscope ( IX73 , Olympus Corporation , Japan ) with a stage device to maintain cells at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 ( Tokai Hit CO . , Ltd , Japan ) . Quantitative Analysis of Cell Movements in Movies To quantify the migration results and analyze the data , computer - assisted tracking of cell position was performed . We collected the x - y coordinates of the front of NK cells over time , using MTrackJ , developed by Meijering and colleagues [ 31 ] ( available online at http : / / www . imagescience . org / meijering / software / mtrackj . ) We tracked all the cells in a given movie , without any selection . Migration rates were calculated as the change in distance per unit time ( μ m / min ) . We calculated instantaneous speed ( distance per time for each frame of every tracked cell ) , total path length per time for each cell track , and net displacement ( distance from start to finish ) per time for each cell track . Persistence , defined as net displacement divided by path length , was calculated for the entirety of one cell track and also in smaller windows of time that were moved over each track from beginning to end . Data were analyzed and statistics performed using GraphPad Prism . Distributions of speeds were far from Gaussian , so data were analyzed as medians and 95 % confidence intervals . Statis - tical tests of significance were unpaired and two - tailed , generating p values from Kolmogorov - Smirnov and Mann - Whitney tests as implemented in Prism . HS1 and Transendothelial Migration of NK Cells PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0118153 February 27 , 2015 6 / 23 An observer counted TEM events in the movie , scoring NK cells that moved underneath the monolayer . The total number of NK cells on the monolayer was counted , and percentage of TEM was calculated as the number of TEM events divided by the number of NK cells . The accumulated number of TEM events versus time was also plotted , based on the movie frame when a cell began to transmigrate . Cells that transmigrated back up to the top surface of the endothelial monolayer were not counted . Protein Pull - down Assays Total proteins were extracted from control and HS1 - siRNA - treated NK cells by lysing cells in IP buffer ( 20 mM Tris , 10 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 05 % NP40 ) containing PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktail ( complete , Mini , EDTA free tablet , Roche ) . Lysates were centrifuged at 15 , 000 x g for 10 min at 4°C , and supernatants were collected . To test whether HS1 knockdown inhibited Vav1 pull - down , we incubated protein A beads coated with anti - HS1 with control or HS1 - depleted NK cell lysates overnight at 4°C . After washing , the beads were boiled with SDS - PAGE sample buffer . Samples were electropho - resed on 10 % SDS polyacrylamide gels , followed by immunoblotting with antibodies to HS1 ( rabbit anti - human HS1 , Cell Signaling ) or Vav1 ( rabbit anti - Vav1 , Cell Signaling ) . Results HS1 and TEM of NK Cells in Transwell Assays To investigate the role of HS1 in TEM by NK cells , we depleted HS1 from NK cells using RNAi . As an initial approach , we assayed TEM using traditional transwell culture chambers with porous filters , as illustrated in Fig . 1A . NK cells added to an endothelial monolayer were challenged to migrate across the monolayer towards a chemoattractant , SDF - 1 α . Cells that crossed the monolayer were collected and counted at points over time . To deplete HS1 from NK cells , we tested four siRNA oligonucleotides , singly and as a pool . siRNA 2 , siRNA 3 and the pool of four caused substantial depletion of HS1 ( 69 % ) , assayed by immunoblot ( Fig . 1B ) . siRNA 4 produced a small effect , and siRNA 1 had no effect . In the transwell assay , HS1 depletion decreased the number of cells in the lower chamber , compared with control ( Fig . 1C ) . siRNA 2 , siRNA 3 and the pool caused statistically significant decreases , but siRNA 1 and siRNA 4 did not , consistent with the decreases in the level of HS1 protein . For subsequent experiments , we combined siRNA 2 and siRNA 3 , and the extent of HS1 depletion was 70 – 75 % by immunoblot . To document specificity for HS1 and to test HS1 mutants , we constructed tdTomato - HS1 expression plasmids resistant to siRNA 2 and siRNA 3 . First , we tested tdTomato - HS1 for ex - pression and localization . The fusion protein was expressed , and it localized to F - actin ( Fig . 1D ) . Next , we tested expression of tdTomato - HS1 for rescue of the transwell knockdown phenotype . Levels of HS1 in knockdown and expression - rescue cells , assessed by anti - HS1 immunofluorescence ( Fig . 1E ) and immunoblot ( Fig . 1F , S1 Fig . ) , were comparable to those in control cells . In the TEM transwell assay ( Fig . 1G ) , siRNA - resistant HS1 ( Res HS1 , green ) fully rescued the defect caused by HS1 knockdown ( red ) , with levels exceeding those of control cells ( blue ) , by a statistically significant margin ( p = 0 . 02 ) ( Fig . 1G ) . The non - siRNA - resistant construct ( WT HS1 , purple ) produced a smaller increase in the level , which was not statistically significant compared to HS1 knockdown ( p = 0 . 28 ) . The levels of rescue for the two wild - type constructs , siRNA - resistant and not siRNA - resistant , were consistent with the level of HS1 protein . We conclude that the level of HS1 is a key parameter controlling the ability of NK cells to perform TEM in the transwell assay in preparations treated with SDF - 1 α . HS1 and Transendothelial Migration of NK Cells PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0118153 February 27 , 2015 7 / 23 HS1 and Transendothelial Migration of NK Cells PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0118153 February 27 , 2015 8 / 23 To confirm these results with an independent RNAi approach , we targeted HS1 with shRNA expressed from a plasmid ( S2 Fig . ) . Overall , similar results were obtained . HS1 - deplet - ed NK cells showed decreased migration into the lower chamber in the transwell assay , com - pared to control , and the phenotype was rescued by expression of HS1 resistant to the HS1 - targeting shRNA . HS1 and Migration of NK Cells across the Surface of the Endothelium To investigate the role of HS1 in the individual steps that compose the process of TEM , we turned from transwell assays to direct visualization by light microscopy . When NK cells en - counter the surface of the endothelium , they adhere and migrate across the surface , as illustrat - ed in movies in S1 Movie and S2 Movie . Dynamic actin filaments and multiple actin regulatory proteins are enriched at the leading edge of migrating cells . Localization of HS1 and F - actin in NK cells migrating on the surface of endothelial monolayers revealed slight enrichment at the leading edge , based on fluorescence staining ( Fig . 2A ) . To test the functional importance of HS1 for NK - cell migration , we depleted HS1 with siR - NAs and collected movies of NK cells migrating across the endothelial surface ( Examples in Fig . 2B , S1 Movie and S2 Movie ) . We used two slightly different experimental protocols . In one set of experiments , the endothelial monolayer was incubated with SDF - 1 α for several minutes , then NK cells were added and allowed to interact with the monolayer for 1 hr before movies were collected . In a second set of experiments , SDF - 1 α was not included , and movies were col - lected immediately , as soon as the NK cells settled onto the endothelial monolayer . We tracked the positions of the NK cells over time , and we analyzed the movement in sever - al ways . To avoid selection bias , a computer - based tracking program followed all the cells over time . We calculated the frame - to - frame distance moved by each cell in each track , the distance from start to finish of each cell track ( net displacement ) , and the total distance moved by each cell along its track ( path length ) . From these distances , we calculated speeds . For “ instantaneous ” speeds , calculated from frame - to - frame distance , the time interval was sufficiently small that many distances were at or near zero , with a non - Gaussian distribution extending to higher values . Histograms of the value reveal that HS1 depletion had no signifi - cant effect , in either set of experiments . S3 Fig . shows representative results , from the protocol without SDF - 1 α treatment . For speeds based on path length , the two sets of experiments revealed different effects of HS1 depletion , which were modest but achieved statistical significance owing to the large amount of data ( Table 2 - 1 , 2 - 2 ) .

With SDF1 - α treatment , HS1 depletion produced a modest ( 20 % ) decrease in speed , with non - over - lapping 95 % confidence intervals and p values < 0 . 01 ( Table 2 - 1 ) . However , with untreated cells , HS1 depletion led to an increase in speed , by a slightly larger amount ( 34 % ) , with non - overlapping 95 % confidence intervals and p values < 0 . 0001 ( Table 2 - 2 , Fig . 2C ) . In each case , the number of data points ( N in the tables ) was large , which accounted for the differences achieving statistical significance . The differences were reproducible and consistent , observed on each of three different days in each set of experiments . For speeds based on net displacement ( start to finish ) , modest differences in the same direction were observed , but they failed to achieve statistical significance for the most part ( Table 3 - 1 and III - 2 ) . Again , the distributions were not Gaussian , and non - parametric statis - tical tests were performed . With SDF1 - α treatment , HS1 depletion produced a modest ( 22 % ) decrease in speed , but the 95 % confidence intervals overlapped , and the p values were 0 . 03 and 0 . 08 from KS and MW tests , respectively ( Table 3 - 1 ) . Results from three days were simi - lar . With untreated cells , HS1 depletion again led an increase in speed , as found for path - length speeds , but only by a small amount ( 6 % ) , with overlapping 95 % confidence intervals significant by z - test ( p = 0 . 15 ) or by Fisher ’ s exact test for a 2 x 2 contingency table ( p = 0 . 19 ) .

Moreover , the results on different days were not consistent ; two days showed small decreases and one day showed a larger increase . Over - all , this analysis revealed no significant difference between control and HS1 - depleted cells ; however , the trends were in the same direction as those for the path - length speeds . Finally , we calculated persistence , defined as net displacement divided by path length . Per - sistence values vary from zero to one , and persistence can be calculated for part or all of a track . We considered the possibility that one cell track might include segments with large movement and high persistence along with segments with little to no movement and low persistence . Therefore , we calculated persistence for sliding windows of 5 , 10 , 15 , and 30 frames , as well as the entire track , for each cell track . Values from zero to one were found , and smaller windows gave higher values , as expected . Only small differences between HS1 - depleted and control cells were observed . The differences were not consistent within one day or between days . Results from a representative experiment are shown in S4 Fig . Overall , persistence analyses revealed no difference between control and HS1 - depleted cells . HS1 Depletion Affects the Route and Overall Efficiency of TEM Next , we asked whether HS1 had a role in the ability of NK cells to perform TEM . First , we ob - served TEM directly in the live - cell movies used to analyze migration above . NK cells on the upper surface of the endothelium stopped , squeezed through the endothelium , and appeared below the endothelium ( Fig . 2B , S2 Movie ) . We counted these events and calculated their per - centage relative to the total number of NK cells . For SDF - 1 α - treated preparations , the frequency of TEM was 11 . 6 % ( 40 TEM events / 344 cells ) for control cells and 7 . 8 % ( 16 / 206 ) for HS1 - depleted cells ( Fig . 2E ) . The difference was not statistically significant . For non - treated preparations , the frequency of TEM was 8 . 4 % ( 108 / 1297 ) for control cells and 6 . 1 % ( 90 / 1482 ) for HS1 - depleted cells ( Fig . 2F ) . The Table 3 .

Using an independent approach , we fixed and stained the preparations , which allows one to observe many fields of view and to determine whether cells migrate via a paracellular route or a transcellular route ( Fig . 3A ) . The route is revealed by the position of the NK cell with respect to endothelial cell junctions , which are visualized with anti - ICAM - 1 and anti - VE - cadherin anti - body staining , respectively ( Fig . 3B ) . First , in experiments with SDF - 1 α treatment , HS1 depletion led to modest decreases in the total number of TEM events , for endothelial monolayers on glass or soft substrate ( Fig . 3C ) . HS1 depletion decreased the frequency of the transcellular route but not the paracellular route for both glass ( Fig . 3D ) and soft substrate ( Fig . 3E ) . Second , in experiments without SDF - 1 α , the ratio of transcellular to paracellular route events was also decreased with HS1 depletion ; however , the difference was small and only achieved statistical significance because of the large number of data points ( Fig . 3G ) . In these experiments , HS1 depletion led to a small non - signif - icant increase in the number of TEM events ( Fig . 3F ) . Tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 Tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 is known to be important for many of its cellular functions [ 16 – 18 ] . In NK cells , HS1 Tyr 397 is required for cell adhesion to ICAM - 1 and for target - cell killing , and Tyr 378 is required for chemotaxis [ 14 ] . In neutrophils , phosphorylation of HS1 Tyr 222 is important for chemotaxis [ 22 ] . We investigated the role of the three HS1 tyrosine residues , 222 , 378 and 397 , in NK cells using transwell assays of TEM . First , we showed that HS1 was phosphorylated on Tyr in our NK cell preparations treated with SDF - 1 α ( Fig . 4A ) . Immunoblots with anti - Pi - Tyr397 showed a low basal level of phos - phorylation , with increased levels at 10 min , followed by a decrease to below basal levels at 60 min . Next , HS1 was depleted from NK cells as above , by HS1 siRNA , and siRNA - resistant HS1 mutants were expressed and tested for the ability to rescue the TEM phenotype in transwell as - says . Immunoblots confirmed that endogenous HS1 was depleted and that the mutants were expressed at comparable levels ( S1 Fig . ) . Wild - type siRNA - resistant HS1 rescued the pheno - type , as discussed above ( Fig . 1G , reproduced on the left side of Fig 4B ) . In contrast , Y378F and Y397F single point mutants of HS1 , expressed in siRNA - resistant constructs , failed to rescue ( Fig . 4B , purple vs black and brown , respectively ) . A Y378F / Y397F double point mutant also failed to rescue ; the result was similar to those for the single point mutants ( Fig . 4B , dark pur - ple ) , suggesting that both tyrosine residues are necessary for the same pathway . For the Y222F single point mutant , the level of rescue was similar to that of the other point mutants ; however , the result was not statistically significant compared to wild - type ( Fig . 4B , orange vs purple ) . Together , the results indicate that HS1 tyrosine residues play important roles in NK cell TEM as measured by transwell assays . Role for the Phospho - HS1 ligand Vav1 Vav1 , a GEF for the Rho family of GTP binding proteins , is a potential ligand for phosphorylat - ed tyrosine residues of HS1 , because Vav1 is known to bind HS1 and to require the Tyr 397 res - idue [ 17 ] . To investigate a role for Vav1 in NK cell TEM , we depleted Vav1 by siRNA and performed transwell assays as above . Depletion of Vav1 protein was confirmed by immunoblot ( Fig . 5A ) . The level of transmigration for Vav1 - depleted NK cells was far less than the number for control cells , by more than half ( Fig . 5B ) . Thus , Vav1 may act as an effector downstream of HS1 in NK cells , helping to transmit or amplify signals required for TEM .

The mean and standard error of the values HS1 and Transendothelial Migration of NK Cells PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0118153 February 27 , 2015 14 / 23 We assayed the effect of Vav1 depletion on NK cell migration across the surface of the endo - thelial monolayer , as part of movie - based experiments testing the effect of HS1 depletion de - scribed above . Simultaneous depletion of both HS1 and Vav1 was also tested . Speeds were decreased for Vav1 - depleted cells , calculated from path length ( Fig . 2C , Table 4 - 1 ) and net dis - placement ( Fig . 2D , Table 4 - 2 ) , in contrast to the increases observed for HS1 depletion . Deple - tion of both HS1 and Vav1 produced intermediate values ( Fig . 2C and 2D , Table 4 - 1 and 4 - 2 ) . Frame - to - frame “ instantaneous ” speeds showed no effect of depletion of Vav1 or HS1 plus Vav1 ( S3 Fig . ) , as found for depletion of HS1 . Persistence values were also not affected . We examined the effect of Vav1 depletion on TEM by scoring events in live - cell movies ( Fig . 2F ) . Depletion of HS1 and Vav1 had similar effects , decreasing the level of TEM , and the double knockdown had a slightly larger effect . All the values for depletion samples were differ - ent from control by statistically significant amounts , but the differences between double and single knockdowns were not significant . Based on this result with this assay , HS1 and Vav1 ap - pear to function in the same pathway . To confirm that HS1 interacts with Vav1 in the NK cell system , we assayed for co - precipita - tion of Vav1 with HS1 ( Fig . 5C ) . HS1 was precipitated with anti - HS1 , and Vav1 was detected by immunoblot ( middle panel , Fig . 5C ) . In a control experiment , with cells depleted of HS1 by siRNA , Vav1 and HS1 were not observed in the immunoblots ( left and right panels , Fig . 5C ) . Arp2 / 3 - Binding and SH3 Domains of HS1 The N - terminal domain of HS1 has an acidic / DDW region , which binds to Arp2 / 3 complex , and the C - terminus has an SH3 domain [ 18 ] . We tested the importance of these domains by test - ing for rescue of the HS1 - knockdown transwell phenotype with expression of HS1 mutants . For Arp2 / 3 binding , we changed the DDW residues to AAA , and for SH3 binding , we changed Trp 466 to Lys . The DDW to AAA mutant of HS1 cannot bind Arp2 / 3 complex and changing Trp 466 to Lys in the SH3 domain of cortactin inhibits ligand binding [ 32 ] . Both mutants rescued the HS1 - depletion phenotype in the transwell assay , similar to wild - type HS1 ( Fig . 4C and 4D , respectively ) . Thus , we see no evidence of a critical role for HS1 binding to Arp2 / 3 or SH3 - do - main ligands in NK cells using this assay . Discussion HS1 is known to have an important role in NK cells in the processes of chemotaxis , cell adhe - sion , actin assembly at the lytic synapse and target cell lysis [ 14 ] . The multi - step process of TEM includes a number of similar motility - related phenomena . Therefore , we investigated whether NK - cell HS1 has an important role in TEM . Role for HS1 in TEM First , we found that depletion of HS1 decreased the frequency of transmigration events by NK cells on endothelial monolayers using conventional transwell assays . The knockdown pheno - type was specific for HS1 , and similar effects were found using two different RNAi approaches . of the plotted points are also indicated , by the dotted lines and error bars .

However , the transwell assay involves chemotaxis , because the NK cells are induced to mi - grate through the transwell filter , from the upper to lower chamber , by a chemoattractant . Therefore , we observed transendothelial migration directly , using microscopy of living and fixed cell preparations . We performed those experiments in two ways — with and without treat - ment of the cell preparations with a chemoattractant , SDF - 1 α . Fig 5 . Role of Vav1 in TEM by NK cells .

Small to moderate decreases in TEM were observed for HS1 depletion ( Fig . 2D , 2E ) . The decrease in TEM with HS1 depletion was statistically significant without but not with SDF - 1 α . An alternative approach was antibody staining of fixed preparations . Using this approach , we observed a moderate de - crease in TEM events for HS1 depletion with SDF - 1 α ( Fig . 3D ) but not without ( Fig . 3G ) . Transcellular vs Paracellular Route for TEM We found that HS1 depletion caused NK cells to prefer the paracellular route relative to the transcellular route for TEM . For preparations treated with SDF - 1 α , the number of transcellular - route events decreased while the number of paracellular - route events did not change ( Fig . 3E , F ) . Table 4 .

In both cases , the transcellular to paracellular ratio decreased with HS1 depletion . The molecular mechanisms for the two routes may differ substantially . Cell junction proteins play dominant roles in the paracellular route , and integrin - based adhesion molecules and receptors are critical for the transcellular route [ 3 ] . Migration of NK Cells on the Surface of the Endothelial Monolayer In movies of living cells , we observed NK cells migrating over the surface of the endothelial mono - layer , before they executed TEM . Computer - assisted tracking of many cells provided us with large quantities of data that revealed several moderate statistically significant differences . Depletion of HS1 led to increased rates of NK cell migration , based on measurements of path length and net displacement ( Fig . 2B , C ) . This result is unexpected if one assumes that HS1 promotes actin as - sembly and actin assembly is necessary for cell migration . However , the biochemical effects of HS1 on actin assembly are complex . HS1 binds directly to F - actin , and it binds and activates Arp2 / 3 complex ; together , these interactions stabilize the branches of the actin filament network . Several other acidic / DDW regulators can bind to Arp2 / 3 complex , in a 2 : 1 stoichiometry [ 23 , 26 , 27 ] . The roles of individual regulators remain to be defined , especially in the complex environment of the cell , as revealed by systematic mutational studies in budding and fission yeast [ 33 – 35 ] . HS1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation and the GEF Vav1 HS1 , like its homolog cortactin , is a prominent substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation down - stream of Src . We found that tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 is also important for NK - cell TEM , based on failure of tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants to rescue the depletion phenotype in the transwell assay . Tyr residues 378 and 397 , which have been implicated previously in NK - cell function , were both important [ 14 ] . The Tyr 222 mutant also failed to rescue , but quantita - tive analysis did not show statistical significance , limiting the strength of the conclusion . Phospho - HS1 interacts with the SH2 domain of the GEF Vav1 [ 17 ] . We confirmed that HS1 and Vav1 interact in our NK cell preparations , based on co - precipitation . siRNA - induced deple - tion of Vav1 decreased the efficiency of TEM in transwell assays ( Fig . 5B ) and movie - based assays ( Fig . 2E ) . The double depletion of Vav1 and HS1 did not decrease TEM more than either of the single depletions ( Fig . 2E ) , suggesting that Vav1 and HS1 function in the same pathway with re - spect to this function . Interestingly , Vav1 depletion decreased the rate of NK cell migration across the endothelial surface , in contrast to the increased rate caused by HS1 depletion ( Fig . 2C ) . Here , simultaneous depletion of both Vav1 and HS1 led to an intermediate phenotype , suggesting that their molecular mechanisms have independent elements . Comparison to Migration in Other Cell Types The role of HS1 in migration has been investigated in other immune cells . In neutrophils , HS1 depletion led to decreased chemotaxis to fMLP , with conventional transwell and live - cell imag - ing assays [ 22 ] . Neither random motility nor adhesion was affected by HS1 depletion . Tyrosine phosphorylation of three HS1 residues , 222 , 378 and 397 , was necessary for HS1 function in chemotaxis , based on Y to F mutations and transwell assays . The triple Y to F mutant did not rescue the chemotaxis phenotype , but the double mutant , 378 and 397 , did rescue , as did all three single mutants . In dendritic cells ( DCs ) from HS1 ( - / - ) mice , the loss of HS1 had no effect on chemotaxis in transwell assays with CXCL12 ( SDF - 1 α ) or CCL19 ( MIP - 3 β ) . However , when cells were ob - served by video microscopy , HS1 - deficient DCs displayed increased speed and decreased per - sistence , with cells migrating in a CCL19 gradient [ 16 ] . HS1 and Transendothelial Migration of NK Cells PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0118153 February 27 , 2015 19 / 23 Finally , a recent study reveals a role for HS1 in chemokine - induced migration of human T cells [ 36 ] . SDF - 1 α induced rapid and transient phosphorylation of HS1 tyrosine residues 378 and 397 . Phospho - HS1 interacted with Nck1 , and depletion of HS1 or Nck1 impaired chemo - kine - induced actin polymerization and cell migration . Other Domains of HS1 HS1 , like cortactin , has an SH3 domain and a domain that binds Arp2 / 3 complex [ 18 ] . Our tests of the functional importance of these domains , based on rescue of knockdown phenotypes by expression of mutants , did not reveal that either domain plays an important role in NK cell TEM . In transwell assays , the mutants provided a full level of rescue . This conclusion is limited , of course , by the assays and the cultured - cell system used in our experiments . Concluding Remarks Our study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for TEM by NK cell . The findings provide information that should be helpful to understand how NK cells provide rapid responses to virus - infected cells and tumor cells . The information may be relevant to other types of cells that display TEM , such as other immune cells and tumor cells , which need to transmigrate as part of metastasis .
