Protein recruitment through indirect mechanochemical interactions Andriy Goychuk 1 and Erwin Frey 1 1 Arnold Sommerfeld Center for Theoretical Physics and Center for NanoScience , Department of Physics , Ludwig - Maximilians - Universit¨at M¨unchen , Theresienstr . 37 , D - 80333 Munich , Germany ( Dated : October 3 , 2019 ) Some of the key proteins essential for important cellular processes are capable of recruiting other proteins from the cytosol to phospholipid membranes . The physical basis for this cooperativity of binding is , surprisingly , still unclear . Here , we suggest a general feedback mechanism that explains cooperativity through mechanochemical coupling mediated by the mechanical properties of phospho - lipid membranes . Our theory predicts that protein recruitment , and therefore also protein pattern formation , involves membrane deformation , and is strongly aﬀected by membrane composition . Protein pattern formation is essential for the spatial organization of intracellular processes [ 1 ] . Examples of biological signiﬁcance include Min oscillations that guide the positioning of the Z - ring to midcell in E . coli [ 2 ] , the roles of cell polarization in determining the position of a new growth zone or bud site in S . cerevisiae [ 3 ] and the anteroposterior axis of the embryo in C . elegans [ 4 ] , and spatiotemporal patterns formed by members of the Rho family of GTPases in eukaryotic cells [ 5 ] . Such self - organized patterns are the product of a dynamic interplay between diﬀusion ( both in the cytosol and on the mem - brane ) and biochemical reactions among proteins and be - tween proteins and the membrane . A crucial motif in all of the biochemical reaction networks that drive these processes is a nonlinear feedback mechanism , which is generally termed recruitment . Here , membrane - bound proteins facilitate the binding of other soluble proteins from the cytosol to the membrane [ 1 ] . For example , in E . coli , membrane - bound MinD is said to recruit both cytosolic MinD and MinE to the membrane . What then is the physical basis for such cooperative binding between proteins and the membrane ? One could adopt a purely chemical perspective and suggest an explanation based on classical concepts of binding cooperativity [ 6 , 7 ] . How - ever , an indiscriminately high chemical aﬃnity between recruiting proteins would also promote protein aggrega - tion in the cytosol as an unwanted side - eﬀect . Then , to still facilitate speciﬁc recruitment to the membrane , a possible strategy is for individual proteins to change their conformation upon binding to the membrane so as to be - come chemically aﬃne scaﬀolds for other proteins [ 8 , 9 ] . In addition to these chemical interactions , binding of pro - teins to membranes inevitably invokes forces that can lead to membrane deformation . Here we show how such mechanochemical coupling can lead to a mechanism for the cooperative recruitment of proteins to phospholipid membranes , and thereby pro - vide an alternative strategy for cooperative membrane binding . The basic idea is very simple : Attractive forces between proteins and phospholipids facilitate pro - tein attachment to the membrane . As equal and op - posite forces must act on the membrane as well , pro - k + k − b a x a b x σ ξ d x µ r ec r u i t 0 f m ec h u 0 u opt E o p t E B ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) FIG . 1 . ( a ) We divide intracellular space into reaction com - partments ( top ) , each containing one protein on average ( blue dot ) and identify the distance from the membrane x as the reaction coordinate . The proteins diﬀuse freely far away from the membrane ( x > d , blue area ) and sense a chemical poten - tial µ close to the membrane ( x < d , red area ) , which facil - itates protein binding . Membrane - bound proteins modulate the chemical potential µ ( arrow ) and therefore induce a pos - itive feedback in the attachment rate k + . ( b ) Exaggerated membrane deformation illustrates protein interactions . At - tachment occurs by ( top ) insertion of an anchor into the inner leaﬂet , or by ( bottom ) deposition through attractive surface interactions . ( c ) In both cases , the mechanical state change ( arrows , u ∈ { ρ , H } ) inﬂuences both the energy density f mech ( solid line ) stored in the deformation of the membrane and the binding energy of a protein E B ( dashed line ) . tein binding will induce mechanical deformation of the membrane . Indeed , it is well known that membrane shape changes can be caused by curvature - inducing poly - mers and proteins [ 10 – 19 ] containing BAR - domains [ 20 – 26 ] and – as recently shown [ 27 ] – also by the Min family of proteins . Equilibrium theories of the cou - pling between proteins and membrane generally lead to membrane - mediated interactions between membrane - bound proteins , as reviewed in [ 28 – 30 ] . The physical ori - gin of such interactions may be hydrophobic mismatch for integral proteins [ 31 – 35 ] , surface interactions that depend on curvature [ 24 , 25 , 32 , 36 – 41 ] , or membrane shape ﬂuctuations [ 42 , 43 ] . Furthermore , these inter - actions may also depend on the packing density [ 44 ] and composition [ 45 , 46 ] of the membrane . Then , pro - teins that are bound to the membrane eﬀectively attract or repel each other [ 47 – 50 ] , and form diﬀerent aggre - a r X i v : 1 9 10 . 00977v1 [ phy s i c s . b i o - ph ] 2 O c t 2019 2 gates [ 30 , 38 , 40 , 51 – 54 ] . Here , however , we do not focus on such self - organization eﬀects . Instead , we ask a dif - ferent and independent question , namely how membrane deformations aﬀect the aﬃnity and kinetic ( un ) binding rates of proteins . We propose a general protein recruit - ment mechanism caused by indirect interactions facili - tated through mechanical deformations of the membrane . As we are interested in quantifying the eﬀect of membrane - mediated interactions on the kinetic rates of protein membrane binding and unbinding , we need to analyze the dynamics of proteins that are subject to both cytosolic diﬀusion ( with diﬀusion constant D ) and a chemical potential gradient µ ( x ) caused by the mechanochemical interaction of proteins with the mem - brane . This is described by a Smoluchowski equa - tion [ 55 , 56 ] for the cytosolic protein density c ( x , t ) : ∂ t c ( x , t ) = D ∇ 2 c ( x , t ) + D k B T ∇ (cid:0) c ( x , t ) ∇ µ ( x ) (cid:1) . ( 1 ) As proteins diﬀuse freely in the cytosol and interact with the membrane only within some narrow range d , a typical spatial proﬁle of the chemical potential is ini - tially ﬂat in the cytosol ( µ = 0 ) and then monotoni - cally approaches that of the proteins at the membrane , µ m ( m , u ) = δF [ m ( σ ) , u ( σ ) ] / δm ( σ ) , where F denotes the free energy functional describing the mechanochemical interaction between proteins and membrane [ 57 ] . In gen - eral , F will depend on both the membrane’s protein den - sity , m ( σ ) , and its mechanical state , u ( σ ) , at position σ on the membrane surface ; see Fig . 1 for an illustration . The local free energy density describing the mechanochemical coupling between proteins and the membrane is determined by lipid - lipid and protein - lipid interactions . We assume that a ﬂuid phospholipid mem - brane can , on a coarse - grained level , be considered as an elastically deformable thin sheet , with bulk modulus κ s , vanishing shear modulus , and a bending modulus , κ b , that is equal for both principal curvatures [ 58 ] . For low levels of strain , we separate the mechanical degrees of freedom of the membrane into lateral stretching and out - of - plane bending [ 59 ] , and write each mechanical contribution to the free energy as f mech ( u ) = 12 κ ( u − u 0 ) 2 . ( 2 ) Here , u ∈ { ρ , H } is a placeholder variable for the mechan - ical state ( conformation ) of the membrane , κ ∈ { κ s , κ b } denotes the respective membrane bulk and bending mod - ulus , and u 0 denotes the equilibrium conformation ( equi - librium density or intrinsic spontaneous curvature [ 60 ] ) . As outlined above , there are several factors that de - termine the interaction between protein and membrane . Conceptually , one may distinguish between two limit - ing cases [ Fig . 1b ] : ( A ) Protein anchorage through a membrane - targeting domain that penetrates into the in - ner leaﬂet of the phospholipid bilayer and induces lat - eral membrane strain , or ( B ) protein attachment to the membrane by surface interactions and membrane bend - ing . In both cases , the binding energy , E B ≥ E opt , of a protein to the membrane will depend on the mechanical state ( conformation ) of the membrane , u . In particu - lar , the binding will be strongest , E B = E opt , for some optimal mechanical state , u opt , where it attains an opti - mal value E opt < 0 [ Fig . 1c ] . This optimal conformation can be understood as a compromise between maximal attractive interactions between proteins and lipids , and minimal steric repulsion [ Fig . 1b ] . As the membrane be - comes crowded with proteins , the binding energy will be reduced due to protein - protein interactions [ 61 ] . Given that the repulsive part of the Lennard - Jones potential scales as ∝ r − 12 at small distances r , this may be ac - counted for by a factor 1 + γ m 6 with γ < 0 ; note that the membrane protein density scales as m ∝ r − 2 . Then , a Taylor expansion of the chemical free energy density to lowest order in the membrane conformation , u , yields f chem ( u , m ) = m (cid:2) E opt ( 1 + γ m 6 ) + 12 (cid:15) ( u − u opt ) 2 (cid:3) , ( 3 ) where the parameter (cid:15) characterizes how strongly the membrane conformation aﬀects protein binding . As noted above , there is a broad range of cytosolic pro - teins that bind to lipid membranes in a curvature - dependent manner [ 17 , 20 – 23 , 26 , 62 ] ; cf . Fig . 1b , lower panel . For example , protein - curvature coupling can arise from bending proteins to the local membrane curva - ture [ 25 , 37 , 39 , 40 , 63 – 65 ] , or by bending the membrane to the shape of the proteins in order to maximize attrac - tive interactions [ Fig . 1b ] . In the following , we speciﬁ - cally consider proteins that couple to the membrane cur - vature ( sum of the two principal curvatures ) , u ≡ H , and discuss lipid - density - coupling proteins in the SM [ 66 ] . As mechanical degrees of freedom relax much faster than protein densities , we adiabatically eliminate the me - chanical degrees of freedom by assuming ∂ u f = 0 , where f = f mech + f chem [ 67 ] . This yields a relation between the membrane conformation u and the protein density m on the membrane : u ( m ) = u 0 + (cid:0) u opt − u 0 (cid:1) m / ( m × + m ) . Here , the ratio between the mechanical modulus κ , and the mechanochemical coupling parameter (cid:15) , deﬁnes a characteristic membrane protein density : m × = κ / (cid:15) . For low membrane protein density , m < m × , the interac - tion between the lipids dominates , and the mechani - cal state of the membrane is given by the equilibrium value u 0 ; cf . yellow symbols in Fig . 1c . With increas - ing number of attached proteins , the membrane grad - ually deforms and adopts the mechanical state that is preferred by the proteins ; cf . blue symbols in Fig . 1c . There is an interplay between a mechanical energy cost that is lowest at the relaxed state of the mem - brane , u 0 , and a binding energy gain that is highest in the deformed state of the membrane which is opti - mal for protein binding , u opt .

Free energy density ( a ) , f / ∆ f , and membrane chemical potential ( b ) , µ m / E opt , plotted as a function of the density of membrane - bound proteins , m / m × , for a series of diﬀerent protein binding speciﬁcities , | ∆ E / E opt | , indicated in the graph . Solid lines represent e γ = − 0 . 004 ; dashed lines represent a system without crowding eﬀects , e γ = 0 . and the lipids read ∆ f ≡ ∆ f mech = 12 κ ( u opt − u 0 ) 2 and ∆ E ≡ ∆ E B = 12 (cid:15) ( u opt − u 0 ) 2 , respectively . Upon eliminating the mechanical degrees of freedom using u ( m ) , the interplay between chemical and mechan - ical terms becomes obvious in the dependence of the free energy density on membrane protein density [ Fig . 2a ] , f ∆ f = e m 1 + e m + e m (cid:0) 1 + e γ e m 6 (cid:1) E opt ∆ E , ( 4 ) where e m : = m / m × and e γ : = γ / m 6 × . The ﬁrst term encodes free energy costs for membrane deformation through protein binding . With increasing protein den - sity , m , this contribution saturates , as the membrane de - forms towards a binding - favorable conformation , imply - ing that the corresponding mechanical free energy costs for binding of additional proteins diminish . For interme - diate membrane protein densities , the beneﬁt from pro - tein binding ( second term in Eq . ( 4 ) ) dominates . Finally , for very high protein densities , protein binding becomes unfavorable due to crowding ( e γ < 0 ) . The chemical potential at the membrane , µ m = ∂ m f , i . e . the energy needed to bind one additional protein to the membrane , reads µ m ( e m ) E opt = 1 + 7 e γ e m 6 + ∆ E E opt 1 ( 1 + e m ) 2 . ( 5 ) In the absence of crowding eﬀects , the chemical poten - tial approaches the optimal value E opt < 0 for large pro - tein densities on the membrane , m (cid:29) m × , meaning that there is an energy gain upon binding [ Fig . 2b , dashed lines ] . Crowding counteracts this gain , such that protein binding at high densities becomes unfavorable [ Fig . 2b , solid lines ] . For low densities ( m < m × ) , protein bind - ing is also disfavored , as there is a free energy cost for mechanically deforming the membrane that is largest for low membrane protein densities m , cf . the last term in Eq . ( 5 ) . The amplitude of this reduction is given by | ∆ E / E opt | , which we term the protein binding speciﬁcity , as proteins with a higher speciﬁcity have a greater prefer - ence for mechanical states other than the relaxed state of the membrane [ Fig . 2b ] . The less speciﬁc the binding of a protein , the smaller the changes in the chemical potential as a function of the protein density on the membrane . What then are the implications of these thermody - namic considerations for the kinetics of protein binding and detachment ? To answer this question one has to solve a ﬁrst - passage - time problem for a particle diﬀusing in a chemical potential as described by the Smoluchowski equation Eq . ( 1 ) . This is a well - studied problem , which dates back to Kramers’ theory of reaction kinetics [ 68 ] . For a one - dimensional reaction coordinate x , with a re - ﬂective boundary at x = a and an absorbing boundary at x = b , the ﬁrst - passage time is given by [ 55 , 56 ] : τ = 1 D Z b a dx e + µ ( x ) / k B T Z x a dy e − µ ( y ) / k B T , ( 6 ) where µ ( x ) is the spatial proﬁle of the chemical poten - tial . In Kramers’ classical escape problem , the reaction rate depends on the height of the barrier that the parti - cle has to cross by diﬀusion to reach its target [ 68 ] . In our case , however , there is no such barrier . Instead , as discussed above , we expect the landscape to exhibit a monotonically increasing or decreasing proﬁle , depend - ing on whether the chemical potential at the membrane , µ m , is larger or smaller than the value in the bulk of the cytosol ( µ cyt = 0 ) ; for an illustration see Fig . 1 . To estimate the kinetic rates , we simplify the geometry of the cell as follows . We divide the space near the mem - brane into small reaction compartments with respective sizes given by the average distance ξ between proteins , such that each compartment contains a single protein on average . Then , one may approximate a binding pro - cess as a one - dimensional diﬀusion process : an initially unbound protein diﬀusing in the cytosol enters one of these compartments at a distance ξ from the membrane and after some time encounters the membrane located at x = 0 . To calculate the corresponding ﬁrst - passage time , the membrane is considered as an absorbing boundary . The cytosolic boundary of each compartment can eﬀec - tively be approximated as a reﬂective boundary , since ( on average ) there is always one protein within each compart - ment , i . e . a protein leaving the compartment at x = ξ is replaced by one entering the compartment . Similarly , an unbinding process may be idealized as a stochastic process , where an initially bound protein detaches at x = 0 ( reﬂective boundary ) and leaves the compartment at x = ξ ( absorbing boundary ) . Given our limited knowledge of the proﬁle of the chem - ical potential , we chose to approximate it by a piece - wise linear function [ Fig . 1a ] . The protein diﬀuses freely ( µ = 0 ) at large distances from the membrane ( x > d ) . In the vicinity of the membrane ( x < d ) , we assume a linear proﬁle µ = µ m ( 1 − x / d ) . In the following , we discuss – for simplicity – the case where ξ = d . The more general ( and more realistic ) case , where the protein also crosses a preceding ﬂat potential of length ξ − d > 0 , yields qual - itatively similar results and is discussed in the SM [ 66 ] . 4 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 e m 0 1 2 3 τ k + 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 e m 0 1 2 3 τ k − 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 e m 0 1 2 3 τ k + 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 e m 0 1 2 3 τ k + 0 . 1 1 10 1 10 speciﬁcity | ∆ E / E opt | c oo p . n ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) FIG . 3 .

Solid and dashed lines represent e γ = − 0 . 004 and e γ = 0 , respectively . ( c ) For low membrane protein concentrations e m , the attachment rate can be approximated by a + b e m n ; corresponding ﬁts are indicated by the dotted lines . ( d ) The cooperativity coeﬃ - cient n increases with protein speciﬁcity | ∆ E / E opt | . With these approximations , we can use Eq . ( 6 ) to obtain an explicit analytic expression for the mean ﬁrst - passage times τ ± of attachment and detachment [ 69 ] . The cor - responding kinetic rates , k ± = τ − 1 ± , expressed in units of the basic diﬀusion time τ : = 2 D / ξ 2 , are found to be k ± τ = 12 (cid:16) µ m k B T (cid:17) 2 (cid:16) e ± µ m / k B T ∓ µ m k B T − 1 (cid:17) − 1 . ( 7 ) These rates exhibit a pronounced nonlinear dependence on the membrane protein density [ Fig . 3 ] . Hence , pro - tein attachment and detachment are both cooperative processes , owing to the mechanochemical coupling medi - ated by membrane elasticity . By ﬁtting the attachment rate , Eq . ( 7 ) , at low densities with k + ≈ a + b e m n , we infer a relationship between the protein speciﬁcity | ∆ E / E opt | and the ( Hill ) cooperativity coeﬃcient n [ Fig . 3c , d ] ; for an analysis in terms of Hill curves please refer to the SM [ 66 ] . Strong cooperativity ( n > 1 ) occurs only for high protein speciﬁcities , | ∆ E / E opt | > 1 . This implies that induction of a membrane conformation that favors protein binding requires the binding of a disproportion - ally large number of proteins to the membrane . There - fore , in the deterministic limit , proteins would not attach to the membrane at all [ Fig . 2a , empty triangles and di - amonds ] . However , stochastic binding events , while un - likely at low protein densities , reduce the free energy cost of subsequent binding events and thereby increase their likelihood . This positive feedback leading to recruitment is a purely stochastic eﬀect , and is related to nucleation during discontinuous phase transitions . To assess whether the proposed indirect cooperativity mechanism could actually come into play at physiological protein concentrations , we estimated its various param - eters from known literature values . For proteins with a membrane sensing domain , typical values for the optimal curvature and binding energy are H opt = 0 . 1 nm − 1 [ 21 , 70 ] and E opt ≈ − 5 k B T [ 71 ] ; we assume vanishing spon - taneous curvature ( H 0 = 0 ) . Across diﬀerent studies , the bending modulus of a phospholipid bilayer was measured to be in the range of κ ≈ 10 . . . 50 k B T , sug - gesting a typical value κ ≈ 30 k B T [ 28 , 72 , 73 ] . Tak - ing a value | ∆ E / E opt | = 2 for protein speciﬁcity where nonlinear binding kinetics is signiﬁcant ( recruitment ) [ Fig . 3d ] , the corresponding range of concentrations , m < m × ≈ 3 · 10 4 µ m − 2 , easily encompasses any physio - logical value ; the maximum packing density of proteins with size 10 nm is 1 · 10 4 µ m − 2 . In summary , we have shown that mechanochemical coupling between proteins provides a possible mecha - nism for the nonlinear binding kinetics ( recruitment ) of proteins to the membrane . The eﬀect originates from the interplay between protein - lipid and lipid - lipid interactions , which induce mechanical deformations of the membrane and thereby alter the protein binding environment . As protein - lipid interactions become domi - nant with increasing concentrations of membrane - bound proteins , the membrane’s mechanical state becomes more favorable for binding . This shows how cooperativ - ity and the recruitment of proteins can naturally emerge without any reliance on direct chemical interactions and conformational changes . The results should certainly be applicable to proteins that are known to bend membranes , e . g . proteins containing BAR domains [ 20 – 23 , 26 ] . As recent experiments have unexpectedly shown that Min protein oscillations can lead to oscillations in vesicle shape [ 27 ] , we would argue that our theory should also apply to the broad class of NTPases that are essential for cellular protein pattern formation . Thus , strain sensing and generation might not only be a property of a few specialized proteins , but might actually be a prominent and perhaps general feature of membrane - binding proteins . Further exploration of curvature sensing during macroscopic pattern formation might be highly rewarding [ 74 – 76 ] . Our theory predicts that one can alter the recruitment exponent n of membrane - binding proteins by tuning the protein speci - ﬁcity ( possibly by changing the membrane composition or introducing permanently - bound membrane - bending proteins ) . Such a change in cooperativity should have a much stronger eﬀect on emerging protein patterns than the tuning of reaction rates , because it changes the nature of the nonlinear coupling . We would expect profound changes in the protein dynamics that could be explored using appropriately modiﬁed reaction - diﬀusion models for various cellular systems [ 77 – 82 ] , as well as by experimentally tinkering with the composition of the membrane . Finally , it would be highly interesting and rewarding to quantify the mechanochemical eﬀect for speciﬁc membrane - binding proteins experimentally . This would provide an interesting basis for theoretical models of pattern - forming protein systems and con - 5 tribute towards revealing the universal role of membrane elasticity in cellular functions .

I . EQUIVALENT FORMS OF THE FREE ENERGY DENSITY In the literature one ﬁnds various equivalent represen - tations of the free energy density describing the thermo - dynamics of membrane - bound proteins that are coupled to membrane curvature . This section serves to show how these can be related to our model . As described in the main text , the free energy density is given by f ( u , m ) = 12 κ ( u − u 0 ) 2 + m (cid:2) E opt ( 1 + γ m 6 ) + 12 (cid:15) ( u − u opt ) 2 (cid:3) . ( S1 ) Upon collecting all terms that depend on the membrane deformation u , an equivalent form of the free energy is : f ( u , e m ) = 12 κ ( 1 + e m ) ( u − u × ) 2 + (cid:20) e m 1 + e m + e m (cid:0) 1 + e γ e m 6 (cid:1) E opt ∆ E (cid:21) ∆ f . ( S2 ) Here , we have deﬁned a characteristic membrane pro - tein density , m × = κ / (cid:15) , and rescaled our variables accord - ingly , e m : = m / m × and e γ : = γ / m 6 × . In this form of the free energy , the characteristic membrane conformation , u × = u 0 + ( u opt − u 0 ) e m / ( 1 + e m ) , directly gives the mem - brane deformation minimizing the free energy . Moreover , one can directly read oﬀ that protein attachment en - hances the stiﬀness parameter : κ eﬀ = κ ( 1 + e m ) . The second line of Eq . ( S2 ) represents a free energy density contribution that only depends on the protein density but not on the membrane conformation . This corresponds to Eq . ( ? ? ) in the main text , as u = u × minimizes Eq . ( S2 ) . Next we show how one can use Eq . ( S2 ) to obtain a Helfrich bending energy containing a spontaneous cur - vature that linearly depends on the membrane protein density [ 1 , 2 ] . We set u ≡ H and u opt ≡ H opt , and assume that the membrane is symmetric in the absence of membrane - bound proteins . Then , the intrinsic sponta - neous curvature of the membrane vanishes , u 0 ≡ H 0 = 0 . If the density of membrane - bound proteins is suﬃciently small , e m (cid:28) 1 , then the ﬁrst line of Eq . ( S2 ) simpliﬁes to : 12 κ ( H − e m H opt ) 2 . ( S3 ) This term can be rewritten in terms of protein surface coverage , θ = m / m s = e m / e m s , where m s is the surface saturation density of proteins . We also rescale the opti - mal curvature , H opt / θ = e m s H opt , to arrive at : 12 κ ( H − θ H opt / θ ) 2 . ( S4 ) The above expression is sometimes used when coupling proteins to membrane curvature [ 1 , 2 ] . S . II . ADDITIONAL FREE ENERGY CONTRIBUTIONS In the main text , we have restricted ourselves to re - pulsive interactions between the proteins , f rep = γm 6 , mainly in order to bound the surface density of surface proteins and to introduce a saturation coverage . Here , we study the additional eﬀects of entropic mixing of proteins and attractive interactions between proteins . The main conclusion drawn from the following analysis is : 1 . Im - portantly , in the high protein speciﬁcity and low protein density regime , where we ﬁnd protein recruitment in the main text , both of these contributions have only minor eﬀects on the binding kinetics . 2 . In the low protein speciﬁcity and high protein density regime , both of these contributions play major roles , as we will discuss below . A . Mixing entropy of membrane - bound proteins The free energy density including the mixing entropy but neglecting repulsive interactions is given by f ( u , m ) = 12 κ ( u − u 0 ) 2 + m (cid:2) E opt + 12 (cid:15) ( u − u opt ) 2 (cid:3) + k B T h m ln (cid:16) mm s (cid:17) + ( m s − m ) ln (cid:16) m s − m m s (cid:17)i , ( S5 ) where the second line denotes the mixing entropy contri - bution , with m s as the saturation density of the mem - brane . We proceed similar as described in the main text by adiabatically eliminating the mechanical degrees of freedom . Then , we ﬁnd the following expression for the chemical potential at the membrane : µ m ( e m ) E opt = 1 + ∆ E E opt 1 ( 1 + e m ) 2 + k B T E opt ln (cid:20) e m e m s − e m (cid:21) , ( S6 ) where e m s : = m 0 / m × is the non - dimensionalized satura - tion density . Comparing the chemical potentials , which include contributions from ( A ) mixing entropy , Eq . ( S6 ) , or ( B ) repulsion between proteins , Eq . ( ? ? ) in the main text , we ﬁnd that both variants show strong repulsion at high protein densities [ Fig . S1a ] . At low protein densi - ties , we ﬁnd that both chemical potential variants become more similar as we increase protein speciﬁcity , thereby re - ducing the relative weight of the entropic / repulsive terms in Eqs . ( S6 ) and ( ? ? ) , respectively [ Fig . S1 , compare solid with dashed lines ] . We proceed as described in the main text and use the chemical potential at the membrane to determine the a r X i v : 1 9 10 . 00977v1 [ phy s i c s . b i o - ph ] 2 O c t 2019 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 e m − 2 − 1 0 1 µ m / E o p t 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 e m 0 1 2 3 τ k + | ∆ E / E opt | 8 4 2 1 0 . 5 0 . 25 ( a ) ( b ) FIG .

The optimal bind - ing energy is given by E opt = − 5 k B T , and the membrane sat - uration concentration by e m s = 2 . 0 . protein binding rates . Analogously to the main text , the protein attachment rates increase nonlinearly as a function of membrane - bound protein density , for high protein speciﬁcities and low protein densities [ Fig . S1b , crosses and empty triangles ] . As discussed above , in this regime , where recruitment can be observed , the mixing entropy does not play a major role for the binding ki - netics . However , for low protein speciﬁcities , the bind - ing rates monotonically decrease ( for all densities ) with increasing membrane - bound protein density [ Fig . S1b , ﬁlled markers ] , because the proteins always compete for the available space . Note that , in contrast , in the main text , the attachment rates only decrease when repulsive interactions between proteins become dominant at high protein densities [ Fig . ? ? b ] . B . Attractive interactions between proteins Motivated by Ref . [ 2 ] , we additionally study the ef - fect of attractive interactions between membrane - bound proteins , which could for example arise from a conforma - tional change upon attachment to the membrane . Then , the free energy density is captured by a ( modiﬁed ) Flory - Huggins theory , including interactions between proteins and the membrane : f ( u , m ) = 12 κ ( u − u 0 ) 2 + m (cid:2) E opt + 12 (cid:15) ( u − u opt ) 2 (cid:3) + k B T h m ln (cid:16) mm s (cid:17) + ( m s − m ) ln (cid:16) m s − m m s (cid:17)i − χm 2 , ( S7 ) where m s is the saturation density of the membrane and χ encodes the strength of the attractive interactions be - tween proteins . We proceed similar as described in the main text by adiabatically eliminating the mechanical de - grees of freedom . Then , we ﬁnd the following expression 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 e m − 5 0 µ m / E o p t 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 e m 0 2 4 6 τ k + | ∆ E / E opt | 8 4 2 1 0 . 5 0 . 25 ( a ) ( b ) FIG . S2 .

Membrane chemical potential ( a ) , µ m / E opt , and kinetic attachment rate ( b ) , k + τ , plotted as a function of the density of membrane - bound pro - teins , m / m × , for a series of diﬀerent protein binding speciﬁci - ties , | ∆ E / E opt | , indicated in the graph . The optimal binding energy is given by E opt = − 5 k B T , the membrane saturation concentration by e m s = 2 . 0 , and the attractive interaction strength between proteins is given by e χ = 2 . 5 k B T . for the chemical potential at the membrane : µ m ( m ) E opt = 1 + ∆ E E opt 1 ( 1 + e m ) 2 + k B T E opt ln (cid:20) e m e m s − e m (cid:21) − 2 e χ E opt e m . ( S8 ) where e m s : = m 0 / m × is the non - dimensionalized satu - ration density and e χ : = χ m × is the rescaled protein - protein interaction strength . For small membrane - bound protein densities , the contribution of attractive interac - tions between proteins to the chemical potential vanishes , as the last term in Eq . ( S8 ) becomes negligible . Then , one obtains a similar behavior as in Sec . S . II A [ Fig . S2a , compare solid with dashed lines ] : with increasing protein speciﬁcity , the chemical potential , Eq . ( S8 ) , approaches the values from the main text , given by Eq . ( ? ? ) . We proceed as described in the main text and use the chemical potential at the membrane to determine the protein binding rates . Analogously to the main text , for high protein speciﬁcities , we ﬁnd a nonlinear recruitment of proteins from the cytosol to the mem - brane [ Fig . S2b , crosses and empty triangles ] . At low protein densities , the contribution from the attractive interactions between proteins becomes negligible . Then , recruitment originates from the mechanochemical inter - actions between proteins and membrane , as described in detail in the main text . At high protein densities , where mechanochemical contributions to the binding rates sat - urate regardless of protein speciﬁcity , attractive interac - tions between proteins becomes dominant and lead to recruitment . Therefore , we conclude that cooperative protein recruitment from the cytosol to the membrane is obtained for the following cases ( i ) at low protein densities by a highly speciﬁc mechanochemical coupling between proteins and membrane ( tunable nonlinear re - cruitment ) , or ( ii ) at high protein densities by attractive chemical interactions between proteins . Here , however , 3 a FIG . S3 . Lattice gas model of a membrane with N lattice sites of size a 2 . Most of the available sites are occupied by N l phospholipids ( yellow ) , which exhibit strong attractive in - teractions with other phospholipids . The remaining sites are either occupied by N p protein anchors ( blue ) , which bind to the membrane through attractive interactions with phospho - lipids , or remain empty . we observe only a linear / sublinear increase of the attach - ment rates with the membrane - bound protein density [ Fig . S2b , empty diamonds and pentagons , ﬁlled trian - gles and diamonds ] . S . III . PROTEIN BINDING THROUGH ANCHOR INSERTION In the main text , we have constructed a description of protein - membrane interactions via symmetry arguments . Then , we have argued that it applies to diﬀerent types of membrane deformations , like lateral strain by lipid den - sity changes . However , one might ask how single proteins can aﬀect the local lipid density , given that any changes of the lipid density in between membrane - targeting pro - tein anchors should relax quickly . While this is cer - tainly correct , at a ﬁnite density of membrane - bound proteins , the free energy density is aﬀected by three fac - tors : ( i ) lipid - lipid interactions , ( ii ) protein - lipid interac - tions , and ( iii ) the corresponding mixing entropy . In the following , we derive such free energy , and thereby pro - vide a more detailed rationalization for the description of protein - lipid coupling . We assume that the membrane can be described as a ternary lattice gas consisting of N l lipids , N p pro - tein anchors , and N − N l − N p unoccupied lattice sites [ Fig . S3 ] . In a lipid membrane , there should be much more lipids than protein anchors or unoccupied lattice sites : N l (cid:29) N p and N l (cid:29) N − N l − N p . To make our calculations as simple as possible , we assume that each lattice site ( size of a 2 ) can be occupied by one of these three key players . Then , the mixing entropy contribu - tion to the free energy density of such a ternary mixture is given by [ 3 ] : f mix = k B T h ρ ln (cid:16) ρρ s (cid:17) + m ln (cid:16) mρ s (cid:17) + ( ρ s − ρ − m ) ln (cid:16) ρ s − ρ − m ρ s (cid:17)i , ( S9 ) where we have introduced the saturation density ρ s = 1 / a 2 , the lipid density ρ = N l / ( Na 2 ) and the protein density m = N p / ( Na 2 ) . In addition to mixing entropy , we assume that lipids strongly attract each other with an interaction energy E ll (cid:29) k B T . Furthermore , pro - tein anchors and lipids also mutually attract each other E lp > k B T ; this attraction should exceed thermal energy to make protein binding favorable . In summary , we then obtain the following Flory - Huggins free energy : f = − E ll ρ s ρ 2 − E lp ρ s ρ m + f mix . ( S10 ) We collect the terms in the mixing free energy , Eq . ( S9 ) , into a protein mixing free energy density ( this contribu - tion does not depend on the lipid density ) , f mix / m = k B T h m ln (cid:16) mρ s (cid:17) + ( ρ s − m ) ln (cid:16) ρ s − m ρ s (cid:17)i , ( S11a ) and the remainder , f mix / r = f mix − f mix / m , f mix / r = k B T h ρ ln (cid:16) ρ ρ s − ρ − m (cid:17) + ( ρ s − m ) ln (cid:16) ρ s − ρ − m ρ s − m (cid:17)i . ( S11b ) Then , given that membrane - bound protein densities should be small , we expand the remainder f mix / r into a Taylor series , to ﬁrst order in m in the vicinity of m = 0 : f mix / r = f mix / ρ − m k B T ln (cid:0) ρ s − ρ ρ s (cid:1) , ( S11c ) where we have introduced the lipid mixing free energy density f mix / ρ = k B T h ρ ln (cid:16) ρρ s (cid:17) + ( ρ s − ρ ) ln (cid:16) ρ s − ρ ρ s (cid:17) i . ( S11d ) In summary , for small membrane - bound protein densi - ties , the free energy density is given by : f = − E ll ρ s ρ 2 + f mix / ρ + f mix / m − m h E lp ρ s ρ + k B T ln (cid:16) ρ s − ρ ρ s (cid:17)i . ( S12 ) For large attractive interaction energies between lipids , the ﬁrst line of Eq . ( S12 ) will have a minimum at an intrinsically preferred lipid density ρ 0 , which is close to the saturation density . Then , we can expand the ﬁrst line of Eq . ( S12 ) to second order in the vicinity of its minimum : − E ll ρ s ρ 2 + f mix / ρ ≈ 12 κ ( ρ − ρ 0 ) 2 + const . ( S13 ) In addition , we also expand the last term of Eq . ( S12 ) to second order in ρ in the vicinity of its minimum ρ opt = ρ s (cid:16) 1 − k B T E lp (cid:17) , ( S14 ) where E lp > k B T . Having done all that , we ﬁnally arrive at an expression which is analogous to the one used in the 4 main text ( plus an expression that contains the mixing entropy of proteins ) , f = 12 κ ( ρ − ρ 0 ) 2 + m (cid:2) E opt + 12 (cid:15) (cid:0) ρ − ρ opt (cid:1) 2 (cid:3) + f mix / m , ( S15 ) where the optimal binding energy is given by E opt = k B T (cid:16) 1 + ln E lp k B T − E lp k B T (cid:17) , ( S16 ) and the coupling between proteins and membrane is given by (cid:15) = 2 E 2lp ρ 2s k B T . ( S17 ) Therefore , an explicit thermodynamic calculation yields the same results that were obtained in the main text through symmetry arguments . Eﬀectively , this models a situation where high lipid densities prevent anchor inser - tion by steric repulsion , while low lipid densities lack the attractive interaction between the lipids and the anchor that is necessary for binding . Then , protein anchors , which are inserted into the inner membrane leaﬂet , in - duce bulk strain in the inner leaﬂet by increasing the density of lipids , while leaving the outer leaﬂet unper - turbed . S . IV . REALISTIC CHEMICAL POTENTIAL PROFILE In the main text , we have considered the special case where a protein interacts with the membrane across the whole reaction compartment ( ξ = d ) . Here we also dis - cuss the general case ξ > d , where a protein diﬀuses freely ( ﬂat chemical potential ) in the region x ∈ [ d . . . ξ ] , and interacts ( ramp potential ) with the membrane within the range x ∈ [ 0 . . . d ] . Then , the kinetic rates for biding and unbinding are given by : k ± τ = ξ 2 (cid:0) ( ξ − d ) 2 + 2 d 2 Γ 2 ∓ 2 d ( ξ − d ) Γ 1 (cid:1) − 1 , ( S18 ) Γ 2 = (cid:18) k B T µ m (cid:19) 2 (cid:18) e ± µ m / k B T ∓ µ m k B T − 1 (cid:19) , ( S19 ) Γ 1 = (cid:18) k B T µ m (cid:19) (cid:16) e ± µ m / k B T − 1 (cid:17) , ( S20 ) where µ m is the chemical potential of membrane - bound proteins and τ = ξ 2 / 2 D is the basic timescale of diﬀusion across the compartment . For ξ → d we recover the case discussed in the main text [ Eq . ( ? ? ) ] , while for d → 0 there is no spatial variation in the chemical potential and the resulting kinetic rates reduce to k ± = τ − 1 . We will discuss a situation where the protein does not interact with the membrane throughout most of the reac - tion compartment ( ξ − d (cid:29) d ) ; for speciﬁcity , we consider ξ − d = 100 d . Then , we observe a much smaller varia - tion of the detachment rates compared to the main text , where ξ − d = 0 [ compare Fig . S4b with Fig . ? ? b ] . This reduction can be explained as follows . After detachment the protein starts diﬀusing in the chemical potential land - scape at the membrane . Therefore , to leave the reaction compartment , the protein ﬁrst has to traverse the interac - tion range d , across which it interacts with the membrane and senses a steep chemical potential [ Fig . ? ? a , bottom panel ] . The shorter the interaction range d , the faster the protein leaves the steep chemical potential and enters the region of free diﬀusion , which is why for ξ − d (cid:29) d the rate - limiting timescale given by time τ that it takes to diﬀuse across the reaction compartment . In contrast , as in the main text , the attachment rate is a highly nonlinear function of the membrane - bound pro - tein concentration e m [ Fig . S4a ] . This is surprising since one might expect that , similar as for the detachment pro - cess , diﬀusion in the extended ﬂat region of the chemical potential is the dominant rate - limiting factor . However , this is not the case . To understand the origin for this dif - ference , note that the boundary conditions of these two processes are diﬀerent . During unbinding , the protein detaches from the membrane , whose reﬂective boundary condition quickly drives the protein across the interaction range d . The situation is genuinely diﬀerent for the at - tachment process , where the protein originates from the bulk and ﬁrst has to diﬀuse across the distance ξ − d to reach the membrane . Then , near the membrane , the pro - tein enters the interaction range d with its steep chemical potential , which is repulsive for small membrane - bound protein concentrations and only becomes attractive for high protein concentrations . As there is no nearby re - ﬂective boundary ( eﬀectively driving the protein away from it ) , the rate limiting factor of the attachment pro - cess becomes the time needed to diﬀuse against the steep chemical potential and to reach the absorbing boundary at the membrane . As discussed above , the detachment rate only varies slightly depending on the membrane - bound protein con - centration τ k − ∈ [ 0 . 7 . . . 1 ] . The nonlinear depen - dence of the binding rate k + on the membrane pro - tein density e m is well approximated by a Hill - like curve : τ ( k + − k + | e m = 0 ) ≈ A e m n / ( K n + e m n ) [ Fig .

( a ) The ﬁt τ ( k + − k + | e m = 0 ) ≈ A e m n / ( K n + e m n ) ( indicated by the dotted lines ) is in good agreement with the attachment rate . ( b ) The scale factor A , which indicates whether the attachment rate is constant or follows a Hill - like curve , indicates a transition from a diﬀusion - limited to a highly nonlinear attachment process at a protein speciﬁcity | ∆ E / E opt | ≈ 2 . Both the cooperativ - ity coeﬃcient ( c ) and the apparent dissociation constant ( d ) increase with the speciﬁcity of the protein | ∆ E / E opt | . Note that both measures only capture the prominent properties of the attachment process when A ≈ 1 . A ≈ 1 [ Fig . S5b ] . Similar as in the main text [ cf . Fig . ? ? d ] , this shows that proteins with a higher speci - ﬁcity | ∆ E / E opt | show higher cooperativity n [ Fig . S5c ] . Here , the scale factor A indicates whether the attachment rate is constant or nonlinear : k + ≈ k + | e m = 0 if A = 0 , while k + ≈ τ − 1 e m n / ( K n + e m n ) if A ≈ 1 ; note that max ( k + ) ≈ τ − 1 [ cf . Figs . S4a , S5a ] . We ﬁnd that the attachment process becomes highly non - linear above a protein speciﬁcity | ∆ E / E opt | ≈ 2 . Then , both the coop - erativity coeﬃcient [ Fig . S5c ] and the apparent dissoci - ation constant [ Fig . S5d ] increase with the speciﬁcity of the protein . Taken together , as in the main text , increasing pro - tein density deforms the membrane towards a binding - favorable conformation , and ultimately increases the at - tachment rate in a pronounced nonlinear fashion . S . V . VARIATIONAL TREATMENT OF THE MEMBRANE In this section , we sketch how one can extend the model presented in the main text to describe membranes of arbitrary shape . Furthermore , we show how gradi - ents in membrane conformation drive in - plane ﬂows of membrane - bound proteins . A . Shape equation for arbitrary deformations In the main text , we have adiabatically eliminated the mechanical degrees of freedom in the free energy by ﬁnd - ing the membrane conformation that locally minimizes the free energy density . However , it is a priori not clear why this should also correspond to the minimum of the global free energy functional . In this section , we show that the results obtained from the main text are valid as long as membrane deformations are suﬃciently small . We assume that proteins couple to the membrane cur - vature . Then , analogously to the main text , the free energy density is given by : f ( u , m ) = 12 κ ( H − H 0 ) 2 + m (cid:2) E opt + 12 (cid:15) ( H − H opt ) 2 (cid:3) + f PP ( m ) , ( S21 ) where f PP ( m ) models direct interactions between pro - teins ( which can be attractive , repulsive , or entropic ) . Note that , in principle , one could also consider proteins that couple to the lipid density in the membrane . Such a coupling could be achieved by insertion of lipid - targeting anchors into the inner leaﬂet of the membrane , while leaving the outer leaﬂet unperturbed . To account for such a coupling , one would separately consider the lipid densities in both membrane leaﬂets , which leads to a description of membrane deformations within the area - diﬀerence - elasticity model [ 4 ] . Below , we will determine an equation for the membrane shape that minimizes the free energy functional associated with Eq . ( S21 ) . In - plane motion arising from tangential stresses always keeps the membrane shape ﬁxed , while out - of - plane mo - tion due to normal stresses changes the membrane shape . Therefore , to ﬁnd the equilibrium shape of the mem - brane , one has to ﬁrst determine the normal stresses act - ing on its surface . This is achieved by considering a vir - tual displacement of all surface points by an inﬁnitesimal distance ϕ orthogonal to the basis vectors that span the membrane ; this is called a variation . Such a variation af - fects the free energy functional , F → F + δF , by changing membrane curvature , H + δH , surface area , S + δS , and surface protein density m + δm . Then , one can determine the normal stress , σ z = δF / δϕ , by a straight - forward cal - culation involving variational calculus [ 5 ] : σ z = 12 κ (cid:0) H − H 0 (cid:1) ( H 2 − 4 K + HH 0 ) + ∆ S (cid:2) κ ( H − H 0 ) (cid:3) + (cid:15) m (cid:0) H − H opt (cid:1)(cid:0) H 2 − 2 K (cid:1) + ∆ S (cid:2) (cid:15) m ( H − H opt ) (cid:3) + H [ m ∂ m f PP ( m ) − f PP ( m ) ] , ( S22 ) where K denotes the Gaussian curvature and ∆ S the sur - face Laplacian operator . The above equation has three main contributions , which we list below sorted by lines : 1 . stress from bending the membrane away from its intrinsic curvature [ 6 – 8 ] , 2 . stress from mechanochemical coupling between proteins and membrane , and 3 . stress from protein - protein interactions . Note that the last line suggests that interactions between proteins can lead to membrane deformations , for exam - ple by protein crowding [ 9 ] . In mechanical equilibrium , 6 normal stresses on the membrane must vanish , σ z = 0 . This yields the shape equation that minimizes the free energy functional associated with Eq . ( S21 ) . B . Shape equation for small deformations Here , we use the results from Sec . S . V A to derive a shape equation that is valid for suﬃciently small curva - tures . We assume that intrinsic membrane curvature , H 0 , and membrane curvature , H , are both suﬃciently small , and therefore neglect the corresponding nonlinear terms in Eq . ( S22 ) . Furthermore , we assume that direct interactions between proteins do not signiﬁcantly con - tribute to membrane deformations , and therefore neglect the third line of Eq . ( S22 ) . Then , the shape equation dramatically reduces to a Laplace equation : ∆ S (cid:2) κ ( H − H 0 ) + (cid:15) m ( H − H opt ) (cid:3) = 0 , ( S23 ) which can be easily solved by integrating twice . To that end , we consider a large membrane with ﬁxed curva - ture , H | ∂S = H 0 , and vanishing surface protein density , m | ∂S = 0 , at the boundaries of integration . The only so - lution to Eq . ( S23 ) that always satisﬁes these boundary conditions is given by H = H 0 + ( H opt − H 0 ) (cid:15) m κ + (cid:15) m , ( S24 ) which is identical to the expression derived in the main text . Therefore , we conclude that , as long as the curva - ture induced by the proteins remains suﬃciently small , the results obtained in the main text can be applied to a general spatially extended setting . C . Tangential forces on the proteins In the main text , we have neglected the eﬀects of gra - dients in membrane conformation and protein density on the distribution of proteins . When one considers such gradients , one ﬁnds that proteins can self - organize on the membrane [ 10 – 17 ] . Speciﬁcally , for proteins that lo - cally force the membrane to a given shape , one ﬁnds that proteins with a symmetric curvature proﬁle repel each other on the membrane , while crescent - shaped proteins can also attract each other [ 18 ] . Here , we consider pro - teins that do not strictly enforce a density - independent local curvature , but gradually deform the membrane with increasing protein density . In that case , one ﬁnds attrac - tive interactions between proteins that lead to the ac - cumulation of proteins in regions of preferred curvature , which we will brieﬂy outline in this section . Tangential displacements of surface points keep the shape of the membrane ( principal curvatures and sur - face area ) ﬁxed , while translating the protein density along the surface . Analogously to out - of - plane motion , see Sec . S . V A , in - plane translations can also have an ef - fect on the free energy , which then resulting in eﬀective tangential forces . We proceed by determining the chem - ical potential , µ m ( m ) = δF / δm , which is encodes how a protein density variation aﬀects the free energy func - tional : µ m ( m ) = 12 (cid:15) ( H − H opt ) 2 + (cid:15) ( H − H opt ) m ∂ m H + ∂ m f PP ( m ) . ( S25 ) Here , the membrane curvature depends on the protein density , as the mechanical degrees of freedom are as - sumed to relax instantaneously . Each protein that moves in the chemical potential , Eq . ( S25 ) , experiences an in - plane force given by f = − ∇ S µ m ( m ) . This becomes relevant when one considers protein self - organization on the surface ( agglomeration towards regions of preferred curvature ) in addition to protein recruitment , but has no eﬀect on the binding kinetics itself .
