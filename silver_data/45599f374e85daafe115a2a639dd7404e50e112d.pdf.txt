PAPKE AND JEFFREY M . WOOLDRIDGE Department of Economics , Michigan State University , Marshall Hall , East Lansing , Ml 48824 - 1038 , USA SUMMARY We develop attractive functional forms and simple quasi - likelihood estimation methods for regression models with a fractional dependent variable . Compared with log - odds type procedures , there is no difficulty in recovering the regression function for the fractional variable , and there is no need to use ad hoc transformations to handle data at the extreme values of zero and one . We also offer some new , robust specification tests by nesting the logit or probit function in a more general functional form . We apply these methods to a data set of employee participation rates in 401 ( k ) pension plans . I . INTRODUCTION Fractional response variables arise naturally in many economic settings . The fraction of total weekly hours spent working , the proportion of income spent on charitable contributions , and participation rates in voluntary pension plans are just a few examples of economic variables bounded between zero and one . The bounded nature of such variables and the possibility of observing values at the boundaries raise interesting functional form and inference issues . In this paper we specify and analyse a class of functional forms with satisfying econometric properties . We also synthesize and expand on the generalized linear models ( GLM ) literature from statistics and the quasi - likelihood literature from econometrics to obtain robust methods for estimation and inference with fractional response variables . We apply the methods to estimate a model of employee participation rates in 401 ( k ) pension plans . The key explanatory variable of interest is the plan ' s ' match rate , ' the rate at which a firm matches a dollar of employee contributions . The empirical work extends that of Papke ( 1995 ) , who studied this problem using linear spline methods . Spline methods are fiexible , but they do not ensure that predicted values lie in the unit interval . To illustrate the methodological issues that arise with fractional dependent variables , suppose that a variable y , O ^ y ^ l , is to be explained by a 1 x / ^ vector of explanatory variables \ = { Xi , X2 XK ) , with the convention that Xi = l . The population model E ( y \ x ) = ^ ^ - i - ^ 2X2 + - + fiKXK = ^ fi ( 1 ) where fiisa Kxl vector , rarely provides the best description of E ( y \ x ) . The primary reason is that y is bounded between 0 and 1 , and so the effect of any particular Xj cannot be constant throughout the range of x ( unless the range of Xj is very limited ) . To some extent this problem can be overcome by augmenting a linear model with non - linear functions of x , but the predicted CCC 0883 - 7252 / 96 / 060619 - 14 Received 25 October 1993 © 1996 by John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Revised 19 February 1996 620 L . E . PAPKE AND J . M . WOOLDRIDGE values from an OLS regression can never be guaranteed to lie in the unit interval . Thus , the drawbacks of linear models for fractional data are analogous to the drawbacks of the linear probability model for binary data . The most common alternative to equation ( 1 ) has been to model the log - odds ratio as a linear function . If y is strictly between zero and one then a linear model for the log - odds ratio is Ei \ og [ y / il - y ) ] \ x ) = xfi ( 2 ) Equation ( 2 ) is attractive because log [ 3 ^ / ( 1 - y ) ] can take on any real value as y varies between 0 and 1 , so it is natural to model its population regression as a linear function . Nevertheless , there are two potential problems with equation ( 2 ) . First , the equation cannot be true if y takes on the values 0 or 1 with positive probability . Consequently , given a set of data , if any observation } » , equals 0 or 1 then an adjustment must be made before computing the log - odds ratio . When the y ^ are proportions from a fixed number of groups with known group sizes , adjustments are available in the literature—see , for example , Maddala ( 1983 , p . 30 ) . Estimation of the log - odds model then corresponds to Berkson ' s minimum chi - square method . Unfortunately , the minimum chi - square method for a fixed number of categories is not applicable to certain economic problems . First , the fraction y may not be a proportion from a discrete group size—for example , j , could be the fraction of county land area containing toxic waste dumps , or the proportion of income given in charitable contributions . Second , one may be hesitant to adjust the extreme values in the data if a large percentage is at the extremes . In our application to 401 ( k ) plan participation rates , about 40 % of the > ' , takes on the value unity . It seems more natural to treat such examples in a regression - type framework . Even when model ( 2 ) is well defined , there is still a problem . Without further assumptions , we cannot recover E ( y \ x ) , which is our primary interest . Under model ( 2 ) the expected value of y given x is f ( " ' ' ' ' ' ^ " • " | ( 3 ) ( \ 1 + exp ( x > 3 + i ; ) where / ( - | x ) denotes the conditional density of u = \ og [ y / il - y ) ] - \ fi given x and t ; is a dummy argument of integration . Even if u and x are assumed to be independent , £ ' ( } ' | x ) = ^ exp ( xy9 ) ] / [ l + exp ( x > 3 ) ] , although Eiy \ \ ) can be estimated using , for example , Duan ' s ( 1983 ) smearing method . If u and x are not independent , model ( 3 ) cannot be estimated without estimating / ( - 1 x ) . This is either difficult or non - robust , depending on whether a non - parametric or a parametric approach is adopted . Instead , we prefer to specify models for £• ( ^ ^ I x ) directly , without having to estimate the density of u given x . Naturally , it is always possible to estimate E ( y \ \ ) by assuming a particular distribution for y given X and estimating the parameters of the conditional distribution by maximum likelihood . One plausible distribution for fractional y is the beta distribution ; MuUahy ( 1990 ) suggests this as one possible approach . Unfortunately , the estimates of E ( y \ x ) that one obtains are known not to be robust to distributional failure ( this follows from Gourieroux , Monfort , and Trognon ( 1984 ) ; more on this below ) . Clearly , standard distributional assumptions can fail in certain applications . One important limitation of the beta distribution is that it implies that each value in [ 0 , 1 ] is taken on with probability zero . Thus , the beta distribution is difficult to justify in applications where at least some portion of the sample is at the extreme values of zero or one . In the next section we specify a reasonable class of functional forms for E { y \ \ ) and show how to estimate the parameters using Bernoulli quasi - likelihood methods . These functional forms and estimators circumvent the problems raised above and are easily implemented . Some ECONOMETRIC METHODS FOR FRACTIONAL RESPONSE VARIABLES 621 new specification tests are offered in Section 3 , and Section 4 contains the empirical application relating 401 ( k ) plan participation rates to the plan ' s matching rate and other plan characteristics . 2 . FUNCTIONAL FORMS AND QUASI - LIKELIHOOD METHODS We assume the availability of an independent ( though not necessarily identically distributed ) sequence of observations { ( Xj , } » , ) : / = 1 , 2 , . . . , A ^ } , where 0 ^ 3 ' , ^ l and N is the sample size . The asymptotic analysis is carried out as N— * oo , Our maintained assumption is that , for all / , ( 4 ) where G ( - ) is a known function satisfying 0 < G ( z ) < l for all zEU . This ensures that the predicted values of y lie in the interval ( 0 , 1 ) . Equation ( 4 ) is well defined even if ) > , can take on 0 or 1 with positive probability . Typically , G ( - ) is chosen to be a cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) , with the two most popular examples being G ( z ) = A ( z ) = exp ( z ) / [ 1 + exp ( z ) ] —the logistic function—and G ( z ) = O ( z ) , where < E ) ( - ) is the standard normal cdf . However , G ( - ) need not even be a cdf in what follows . In stating equation ( 4 ) we make no assumption about an underlying structure used to obtain J , . In the special case that yi is a proportion from a group of known size n , , the methods in this paper ignore the infonnation on « , . There are some advantages to ignoring n , . First , one does not always want to condition on n , , in which case y , contains all relevant infonnation . Second , the methods here are computationally simple . Third , under the assumptions we impose , the method suggested here need not be less efficient than methods that use information on group size . ( See Papke and Wooldridge ( 1993 ) for methods that incorporate infonnation on n , in a similar framework . ) We have stated the functional form directly in terms of E ( y , | Xj ) , where Xj is observable . Stating the model of interest in terms of £ ( > , | Xj , ^ , ) , where 0 , is unobserved heterogeneity independent of X ; , requires one to specify a distribution for ^ , in order to obtain E ( j , | X ; ) ( which is ultimately of interest in any case ) . Generally , although not always , this will lead to a different functional form from equation ( 4 ) . Allowing for functional forms other than the index structure in equation ( 4 ) may be worth - while , but it is not within the scope of this paper . In Section 3 we present a general functional form test that has power against a variety of functional form misspecifications , including those that arise from models of unobserved heterogeneity . Under equation ( 4 ) , fi can be consistently estimated by non - linear least squares ( NLS ) . The fact that equation ( 4 ) is non - linear in ^ is perhaps the leading reason a linear model for _ y , or for the log - odds ratio is used in applied work . Further , heteroscedasticity is likely to be present since Var ( > ' , | Xj ) is unlikely to be constant when O ^ yi ^ l . Obtaining the NLS estimates and heteroscedasticity - robust standard enors and test statistics requires special programming , and the NLS estimator will not have any efficiency properties when Var ( y ^ | x ) is not constant . Still , the motivation underlying NLS is sound because it directly estimates E ( y \ x ) . See also MuUahy ( 1990 ) , who suggests NLS for continuously distributed outcomes on a bounded interval . The estimation procedure we propose is a particular quasi - likelihood method , as in Gourieroux , Monfort , and Trognon ( 1984 ) ( hereafter GMT ) and McCullagh and Nelder ( 1989 ) ( hereafter MN ) . The Bernoulli log - likelihood function , given by - y , log [ G ( Xib ) ] - h ( 1 - y , ) \ og [ l - G ( Xib ) ] ( 5 ) is well defined for O < G ( - ) < 1 and is attractive for several reasons . First , maximizing the Bernoulli log - likelihood is easy . Second , because equation ( 5 ) is a member of the linear exponential family ( LEF ) , the quasi - maximum likelihood estimator ( QMLE ) of fi , obtained 622 L . E . PAPKE AND J . M . WOOLDRIDGE from the maximization problem max b is consistent for ) 3 provided that equation ( 4 ) holds . ( This follows from GMT ( 1984 ) and is also easily seen by computing the score Si ( b ) = V ^ / , ( b ) ' and showing that E [ Si ( fi ) \ xi ] = O under equation ( 4 ) . ) In other words , the Bernoulli , QMLE fi is consistent and ViV - asymptotically normal regardless of the distribution of > ' , conditional on X ; ; > , could be a continuous variable , a discrete variable , or have both continuous and discrete characteristics . As we will see below , in some cases for fractional data the Bernoulli QMLE is efficient in a class of estimators containing all QMLEs in the LEF and weighted NLS estimators . A special case of equation ( 5 ) —namely , when G ( - ) is the logistic function—has been suggested in the GLM framework by MN ( 1989 ) . The GLM approach has two drawbacks for economic applications . First , for the logit QMLE it assumes that Var ( y , I Xi ) = a ^ G ( \ ifi ) [ l - G ( \ ; fi ) ] for some a ^ > 0 ( 6 ) where G ( - ) = A ( - ) . While we prefer equation ( 6 ) as a nominal variance assumption to the nominal NLS homoscedasticity assumption Var ( y , | Xj ) = a ^ imposing any particular conditional variance when performing inference is too restrictive . Mechanisms for which equation ( 6 ) fails are common and are related to the literature on binary choice models with over - dispersion ; see , for example , MN ( 1989 , section 4 . 5 ) . Briefiy , if each } ' , is computed as the average of n , independent binary variables , say y , ^ , such that P ( y . y = 11 Xj , / i , ) = G { Xifi ) , then it can be shown that Var ( y , \ xj = £ ( n " ' | x , ) Gix . , fi ) [ l - G { x , fi ) ] Unless n , and X ; are independent , equation ( 6 ) generally fails . In our application , where y ^ y is a binary indicator for whether worker j at firm i contributes to a 401 ( k ) plan , n , is the number of workers at firm / , and Xj contains firm characteristics , n , and Xj are unlikely to be independent in the population . In addition , equation ( 6 ) can fail if there are unobserved group effects . Notice , however , that neither of these situations invalidates equation ( 4 ) , which is all that is needed to consistently estimate fi using the Bernoulli QMLE . The second drawback to the GLM approach is related to the first : if the variance assumption ( 6 ) fails , MN ( 1989 , p . 330 ) reject the logit quasi - likelihood approach and suggest a more complicated quasi - likelihood . But this begs the issue of whether the conditional mean model ( 4 ) is appropriate . Here , we are primarily interested in the conditional mean . Rather than abandoning the Bernoulli QMLE because equation ( 6 ) might fail , we propose asymptotically robust inference for the conditional mean parameters . To find the asymptotic variance of the Bernoulli QMLE , define g ( z ) = dG ( z ) / dz , G , = Gix , fi ) = Si , and g , = gix ^ fi ) . Then the estimated infonnation matrix is , ( 1 - G , ) ] The standard error of ^ j reported from standard binary response analysis ( regardless of the nature of } ' , ) would be obtained as the square root of the y * diagonal element of A " ' . Under equation ( 4 ) only , this is not a consistent estimator of the true asymptotic standard error ; we also need the outer product of the score . Let iii = yi - G ( Xifi ) be the residuals ( deviations ECONOMETRIC METHODS FOR FRACTIONAL RESPONSE VARIABLES 623 between _ y , and its estimated conditional expectation ) , and define Then a valid estimate of the asymptotic variance of fi is ' ( 9 ) The standard enors are obtained as the square roots of the diagonal elements of equation ( 9 ) ; see GMT ( 1984 ) and Wooldridge ( 1991b ) for general treatments . Interestingly , the robust standard enors from equation ( 9 ) in the context of ordinary logit and probit are computed almost routinely by certain statistics and econometrics packages , such as STATA® and SST® . Unfortunately , the packages with which we are familiar automatically transform the dependent variable used in logit or probit into a binary variable before estimation , or do not allow non - binary variables at all ( STATA® and SST® fall into the first category ) . With the minor change of allowing for fractional y in so - called binary response analysis , standard software packages could be used to estimate the parameters in equation ( 4 ) and to perform asymptotically valid inference . Alternatively , programming the estimator in a language such as GAUSS® , as we do for our application in Section 4 , is fairly straightforward . If the GLM assumption ( 6 ) is maintained in addition to ( 4 ) then 6 ^ is consistently estimated by u \ ( 10 ) 1 = 1 where w , are the weighted residuals ( sometimes called the Pearson residuals ) : M , = M , / [ G , ( l - G , ) ] ' / 2 ( 11 ) ( It is standard practice in the GLM literature to use the degrees - of - freedom adjustment in equation ( 10 ) in estimating a ^ . ) Then the asymptotic variance of fi is estimated as a ^ A ' ' ; see also MN ( 1989 , p . 327 ) . In addition , under equation ( 6 ) Var ( } ' , | Xj ) is proportional to the variance in the Bernoulli distribution , and so by the results of GMT ( 1984 ) , the Bernoulli QMLE is efficient in the class of QMLEs in the LEF . This is essentially the same as the class of all weighted NLS estimators , and so it is a non - trivial efficiency result . To summarize , we have chosen a functional form that ensures estimates of E ( > ' | x ) are between zero and one , and a quasi - likelihood function that leads to a relatively efficient QMLE under a popular auxiliary assumption—namely , equation ( 6 ) . In addition , we guard against failure of this variance assumption by using equation ( 9 ) as the variance estimator . In the next section we suggest specification tests that are valid with and without equation ( 6 ) . 3 . SPECinCATION TESTING Specification testing in this framework can be carried out by applying the results of Wooldridge ( 1991a , b ) . We discuss two forms of the test . The first is valid under equations ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) ; these are non - robust tests because they maintain the GLM variance assumption . The second , robust form of the test requires only equation ( 4 ) . We focus primarily on Lagrange multiplier or score tests that nest E ( y \ x ) = Gixfi ) within a more general model . Let m ( x , z , fi , y ) be a model for £ ( y | x , z ) , where z is a 1 xy vector of 624 L . E . PAPKE AND J . M . WOOLDRIDGE additional variables ; the elements of z can be non - linear functions of x ( in which case E { y \ x ) = E ( y \ x , z ) ) , or variables not functionally related to x , or both . The vector y is a Q x 1 vector of additional parameters . The null is assumed to be HQ : y = yo for a specified vector y ^ ( often yo = 0 ) . Then , by definition , Gixfi ) ^ mix , z , fi , yo ) ( 12 ) Given the estimates under the null , fi , define the 1 x A " vector V ^ m , = 3m ( Xi , z , , fi , yo ) / dfi = g , Xi and the ixQ vector V ^ m , = 3m ( Xi , Zi , y § , yo ) / 3y ; these are the gradients of the regression function with respect to fi and y , respectively , evaluated under the null hypothesis . Define the weighted residuals ii , as in equation ( 11 ) and the weighted gradients as ^ ( 13 ) ( 14 ) As in equation ( 11 ) , the weights are proportional to the inverse of the estimated nominal standard deviation ( see equation ( 6 ) ) . A valid test of HQ : y = yo depends on what is maintained under the null hypothesis . Under the assumptions ( 15 ) and Var ( y , | x ^ , zj = a ^ G ( Xi ^ ) [ l - G ( Xi ^ ) ] ( 16 ) a valid statistic is obtained as NRl from the OLS regression « , on V ^ m , , V ^ m , . / = 1 , 2 , . . . , N ( 17 ) where Rl is the constant - unadjusted r - squared . Under equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) , NRl is distributed asymptotically as XQ —see Wooldridge ( 1991a ) . For binary choice models , Engle ( 1984 ) and Davidson and MacKinnon ( 1984 ) suggest a test based on regression ( 17 ) for logit and probit . Gurmu and Trivedi ( 1993 ) present results for a class of models that allows testing the logit function against a more general index function . But for fractional dependent variables it is important to use the NRl form rather than the explained sum of squares form suggested in Davidson and MacKirmon ( 1984 ) : the latter test requires a ^ = \ , which is always the case for binary response variables but is too restrictive for fractional response variables . Alternatively , as in Gurmu and Trivedi ( 1993 ) , each term in regression ( 17 ) can be divided by 6 and then the explained sum of squares can be used . This is essentially the same as the NRl statistic ( although they will differ if 6 is estimated with the degrees - of - freedom adjustment in equation ( 10 ) ) . It is often useful to have a likelihood - based statistic , especially for testing exclusion restrictions . Under the same two assumptions ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) , a quasi - likelihood ratio ( QLR ) statistic has a limiting chi - square distribution . Let ^ N ( A ^ O ) denote the log - likelihood evaluated under the null , and let ^ ^ ( fi , ) > ) denote the log - likelihood from the unrestricted model ( that is , the Bernoulli log - likelihood with m { x , z , fi , y ) used in place of Gixifi ) ) . Further , define m , sm ( x , , Zi , ) 8 , jJ ) , and let the variance estimator based on the unrestricted estimates be ( note that the summation is simply the sum of weighted squared residuals from the unrestricted ECONOMETRIC METHODS FOR FRACTIONAL RESPONSE VARIABLES 625 model ) . Then the QLR statistic , defined by QLR ^ 2 [ ^ M } > ) - ^ M 7o ) ] / ( ^ ' ( 19 ) is distributed asymptotically as XQ under the null hypothesis , provided equation ( 16 ) holds in addition to ( 15 ) . The validity of this statistic follows because the usual infonnation matrix equality holds up to the scalar a ^ when the conditional mean and conditional variance are conectly specified . A form of the LM statistic that is valid under equation ( 15 ) alone can be computed from an additional regression . First , regress V ^ m , on V ^ m , and save the 1 x < 3 residuals , f . ^ s ( fn , fi2 , . . . , fiQ ) , i = l , 2 , . . . , N . ( This is the same as regressing each element of Vym , on the entire vector V ^ m , , and collecting the residuals . ) Next , obtain the 1 x Q vector M . fj = ( w , f , , , w , r , 2 , . . . , « , r , e ) . The robust LM statistic is obtained as N - SSR , where SSR is the usual sum of squared residuals from the auxiliary regression of unity on w , T - J : lonM . fi i = l , . . . , N ( 20 ) Under HQ , which is equation ( 16 ) in this case , N - SSR ~ XQ - The validity of this procedure is discussed further in Wooldridge ( 1991a , b ) . Briefiy , A ^ - SSR from equation ( 20 ) is a quadratic form in the vector N ~ ^ ^ ^ Z / li f / " , , with a weighting matrix that is the inverse of a consistent estimator of its asymptotic variance whether or not equation ( 16 ) holds . In testing for omitted variables , one can use the QLR statistic or the usual LM statistic under equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) , or the robust LM statistic under equation ( 15 ) only . ( Of course , Wald statistics can also be defined for these two cases , but they are computationally more cumbersome than the QLR and LM statistics . ) For omitted variables tests , m ( Xi , Zi , / 3 , y ) = G ( Xiy8 + Ziy ) , V , m , = g , Zi = g ( Xi / 3 ) - Zi , and V , m , = giZy [ G , ( l - G , ) ] ' / ^ One way to test for functional form is to define Zj as polynomials , interactions , or other functions of x , . A general functional form diagnostic is obtained by extending Ramsey ' s ( 1969 ) RESET procedure to index models . For example , let the alternative model be E ( yi I x ; ) = G ( x , fi + y , { x , fi ) ' + y2 { x , fi ) ' ) ( 21 ) where , again , G ( - ) is typically the logistic function or the standard normal cdf . This alternative functional form ( or including even higher powers of Xj ^ ) can be motivated quite generally . Since G ( - ) is a strictly increasing function in most applications , any index model of the form F { yi I Xi ) = Hixxfi ) for unknown H can be arbitrarily well approximated by G ( ZA = I yMifiY ) for / large enough ( by standard approximation results for polynomials ) . Since models with unobserved heterogeneity of the form £ ( y , | Xi , ^ i ) = G { Xifi - f 0 , ) , where ^ , is independent of Xi , have an index structure , a test of the null model against equation ( 21 ) should have power for alternatives that can be derived explicitly from models of unobserved heterogeneity . In practice , the first few terms in the expansion are the most important , and we use only the quadratic and cubic terms . In the context of equation ( 21 ) , the hypothesis that equation ( 15 ) holds ( with Zi = Xi ) is stated as Hg : yi = O , 72 = 0 . This is easily tested using the LM procedures outlined above . ( By contrast , the QLR statistic is computationally difficult as well as nonrobust . ) First , estimate the model under the assumption y , = y ^ = 0 , as is always done . Define fi , Gj , g , , « , , V ^ m , , and u ^ as before . The gradient with respect to y = ( y , , y2 ) ' is Vym , = { gi• ( Xi ) 3 ) ^ ^ i ' iXifi ) ^ } , and V ^ m , is defined in equation ( 14 ) . The statistic obtained from regression ( 17 ) is distributed approximately as xl under ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) . The robust form is obtained from regression ( 20 ) . 626 L . E . PAPKE AND J . M . WOOLDRIDGE 4 . EMPIRICAL APPLICATION : PARTICIPATION IN 401 ( k ) PENSION PLANS 401 ( k ) plans differ from traditional employer - sponsored pension plans in that employees are permitted to make pre - tax contributions and the employer may match part of the contribution . Since participation in these plans is voluntary , the sensitivity of participation to plan characteristics—specifically the employer matching rate—will play a critical role in retirement saving . Pension plan administrators are required to file Form 5500 annually with the Intemal Revenue Service , describing participation and contribution behavior for each plan offered . Papke ( 1995 ) uses the plan level data to study , among other things , the relationship between the participation rate and various plan characteristics , including the rate at which a firm matches employee contributions . Papke ( 1995 ) also contains a discussion of the theoretical underpinnings relating participation and the size of the match rate . Not surprisingly , under standard assumptions on the utility function , participation is positively related to the match rate . The participation rate ( PRATE ) is constructed as the number of active accounts divided by the number of employees eligible to participate . An active account is any existing 401 ( k ) account—a contribution need not have been made that plan year . The plan match rate { MRATE ) is not reported directly on Form 5500 , but can be approximated by the ratio of employer to employee contributions for plans that provide some matching . This calculated match rate may exceed the plan ' s marginal rate because employer contributions include any fiat per participant contribution or any helper contribution made to pass anti - discrimination tests . While the calculated match rate exceeds the marginal incentive facing each saver , it may be a better indicator of overall plan generosity . See Papke ( 1995 ) for additional discussion . Papke ( 1995 ) uses a spline method to estimate models with the participation rate , PRATE , as the dependent variable . She finds a statistically significant positive relationship between PRATE and MRATE , with some evidence of a diminishing marginal effect . Here , we allow for a diminishing marginal effect of MRATE on PRATE by using a conditional mean of the form ( 4 ) with G ( - ) taken to be the logit function . We compare this directly with linear models where PRATE is the dependent variable . Table I presents summary statistics for the sample of 401 ( k ) plans from the 1987 plan year . Statistics are presented separately for the 80 % of the plans with match rates less than or equal to one . Match rates well above one likely indicate end - of - plan year employer contributions made to avoid IRS disqualification ; see Papke ( 1995 ) for further discussion . Initially , we focus on the subsample with MRATE < 1 . Participation rates in 401 ( k ) plans are high—averaging about 85 % in our sample . Over 40 % of the plans ( 42 - 73 ) have a participation proportion of exactly unity—all eligible employees have an active account . This characteristic of the data would make a log - odds approach especially awkward because an adjustment would have to be made to 40 % of the observations . The plan match rate averages about 41 cents on the dollar . Other explanatory variables include total firm employment ( EMF ) which averages 4 , 622 across the plans . The plans average 12 years in age ( AGE ) . SOLE is a binary indicator for whether the 401 ( k ) plan is the only pension plan offered by the employer . Sole plans comprise about 37 % of the sample . We begin with the linear model EiPRATE IX ) = / S , - H ^ 2MRATE + ^ 3 log ( £ : MP ) - 1 - ^ 4 log ( £ : MP ) ' + fi .

All variables are highly statistically significant except for the sole plan indicator . Interestingly , there is very little difference between the usual OLS standard enors and the heteroscedasticity - robust ones . The key variable MRATE has a / - statistic well over 10 . Its coefficient of 0 - 156 implies that if the match rate increases by 10 cents on the dollar , the participation rate would increase on average by almost 1 - 6 percentage points . This is not a small effect considering that the average participation rate is about 85 % in the subsample . The linear model implies a constant marginal effect throughout the range of MRATE that carmot literally be true . That the linear model does not fit as well as it should can be seen by computing Ramsey ' s ( 1969 ) RESET ( and its heteroscedasticity - robust version ) .

Then , the LM version of RESET is obtained as NR ^ from the regression u on X . v ^ v ^ / • = 1 2 N Uj yjii Ai , jfi , yi t — 1 , ^ , . . . , jv Under the null that equation ( 22 ) is true , NR ^ ~ xl ( homoscedasticity is also maintained ) .

Using either non - robust RESET or its robust form , equation ( 22 ) is strongly rejected ( the 1 % critical value for a ^ 2 is 9 - 21 ) . Because RESET is a test of functional form , we conclude that equation ( 22 ) misses some potentially important non - linearities .

SSR is the sum of squared residuals and SER is the standard error of the regression ; for QMLE , the SER is defined in terms of the weighted residuals . The values in parentheses below the RESET statistics are p - values ; these are obtained from a chi - square distribution with two degrees - of - freedom . where G ( - ) is the logistic function . ( The GAUSS® code used for the estimation and testing is available on request from the authors . ) The partial effect of MRATE on EiPRATE \ x ) is dEiPRATE I x ) / dMRATE , or , for specification ( 23 ) , gixfi ) fi2 , where g ( z ) sdG ( 2 ) / dz = exp ( z ) / [ 1 - f exp ( z ) ] ^ Because g ( z ) —»0 as z— > < » , the marginal effect falls to zero as MRATE becomes large , holding other variables fixed . Column ( 2 ) of Table II contains the results of estimating equation ( 23 ) . The variable MRATE is highly statistically significant and , with the exception of SOLE ( which is still not significant ) , the directions of effects of all other variables are the same as in the linear model . Unlike the linear model , the RESET statistic reveals no misspecification in equation ( 23 ) ; the p - value for the robust statistic is 0 - 676 , and it is even larger for the non - robust statistic . Based on this ECONOMETRIC METHODS FOR FRACTIONAL RESPONSE VARIABLES 629 RESET analog , equation ( 23 ) appears to capture the non - linear relationship between PRATE and the explanatory variables for MRATE ^ 1 . There is other evidence that equation ( 23 ) fits better than ( 22 ) . Table II also contains an r - squared for each model , which in either case is defined as 1 - SSR / SST , where SST is the total sun of squares of the y ^ . The SSRs , reported in Table II , are based on the unweighted residuals , " i = yt ~ Si for OLS and QMLE . Thus , the r - squareds are comparable across any model for EiPRATE I x ) and for any estimation methods . From Table II we see that the r - squared from the logit model is about 6 % higher than the r - squared for the linear model . Also , while OLS chooses fi to maximize the r - squared over all linear functions of x , the logit QMLE does not maximize r - squared given the logit functional form ; yet the logit model has a higher r - squared than the linear model . Since we are only modelling the conditional expectation , with other features of the conditional distribution left unspecified , the r - squared is the most appropriate goodness - of - fit measure . Before directly comparing estimates of the response functions and the marginal effects , some other comments are worth making about Table II . First , each method comes with an SER ( standard enor of the regression ) . These SERs are the estimates of a for the different models , and thus are not directly comparable . For OLS , a ^ is based on the unweighted OLS residuals , while for QMLE , o ^ is based on the weighted residuals ; see equation ( 11 ) . Because a = 0 - 438 for the QMLE , this implies that the usual logit standard enors obtained from the inverse of the Hessian , A ~ ' , are over twice as large as the GLM standard enors that are obtained as the squared roots of the diagonal elements of d ^ A ~ \ The latter ( smaller ) standard enors are the appropriate ones under the GLM assumption ( 6 ) because they do not assume that a = I . MRATE is underdispersed ( cr ^ < 1 ) relative to the Bernoulli variance ( a ^ = 1 ) . We now turn to a direct comparison of the linear and logistic models . To compare the estimated response functions and marginal effects , we need to choose values for MRATE , EMP , AGE , and SOLE . Because most 401 ( k ) plans are accompanied by other pension plans , we set SOLE = 0 . We also set AGE at roughly its sample average , AGE = 13 . To gauge the differences across firms of different sizes we choose three firm sizes : small ( £AfP = 200 ) , average ( EMP = 4620 ) , and large iEMP = 100 , 000 ) The estimated relationships between EiPRATE \ x ) and MRATE for the three different firm sizes are graphed in Figure 1 . Interestingly , for a small firm the linear and logistic predictions are most different at high match rates ; for the average sized firm , the difference is largest at low match rates ; and for a large firm the largest difference is at a match rate between 0 - 5 and 0 - 75 . As is seen from Table II , the marginal effect of MRATE on EiPRATE \ x ) for the linear model is 0 - 156 for any value of x . For the logistic model , we set SOLE = 0 , AGE = 13 , and EMP = 4 , 620 , and compute the estimated partial effect at three different match rates : MRATE1 = O , MRATE = 0 - 50 , and MRATE = 10 . The estimated derivatives are 0 - 288 , 0 - 197 , and 0 - 118 , respectively , which illustrates the diminishing marginal effect as MRATE increases . Perhaps not surprisingly , the marginal effect estimated from the linear model is bracketed by the low and high estimates from the non - linear model . The differences in the estimated marginal effects are not trivial ; for example , the non - linear model predicts an increase in participation of approximately 2 - 9 percentage points in moving from a zero match rate to MRATE = 0 - 10 , rather than the 1 - 6 percentage point increase obtained from the linear model . Similarly , at high match rates the marginal effect from increasing the match rate is estimated to be lower in the non - linear model . One way to try to salvage the linear model is to use a more fiexible functional form in the match rate . A popular functional form that allows a diminishing marginal effect is a quadratic . Column ( 3 ) contains estimates of the linear model that includes a quadratic in MRATE . The 630 L . E . PAPKE AND J . M . WOOLDRIDGE ( a ) . 9 - . 7 - ( b ) I - HI . 9 - .

But even with this additional regressor the model in column ( 3 ) does not fit as well as the logistic model without the quadratic term ( the r - squared for the linear model with the quadratic term is only 0 - 144 ) . Further , the rejection of the model by RESET is almost as strong as it was without the quadratic . Thus , we conclude that simply adding MRATE ^ to equation ( 22 ) is not sufficient . ( The spline approach used by Papke ( 1995 ) is more effective in capturing a diminishing effect in this application , but the coefficients are more difficult to interpret . ) When MRATE ^ is added to equation ( 23 ) it turns out to be insignificant . Thus , the logistic functional form , with the term linear in MRATE , appears to be enough to capture the diminishing effect , at least for MRATE ^ 1 . This is a useful lesson : a significant quadratic term in a linear model might be indicating that an entirely different , more parsimonious , functional form can provide a better fit . Model ( 23 ) is clearly the prefened specification thus far . As another test of model ( 23 ) , we interact log ( £ ' MP ) with each of MRATE , AGE , AGE ^ , and SOLE and test for exclusion of these four interactions using the LM and QLR tests discussed in Section 3 . This is similar in spirit to a Chow test where the sample is split based on firm size , but here we do not need to make an arbitrary choice about where to split the sample . The LM statistic is 16 - 52 , the robust LM statistic is 14 - 41 , and the QLR statistic , computed from equation ( 19 ) , is 15 - 78 ( a ? = - 1547 - 33 , < t = - 1548 - 84 , and o ^ = 0 - 1914 ) . The associated p - value for the robust LM statistic is 0 - ( X ) 6 , which rejects equation ( 23 ) at the 1 % significance level . Thus , equation ( 23 ) apparently misses some non - linearities , although the significance level is not very small given the large sample size ( compare the p - value for RESET in the linear model ) . From a practical perspective , the story about the relationship between expected PRATE and MRATE does not change : the / - statistic on the term logiEMP ) MRATE is only - 1 - 27 ( the robust r - statistic is - 1 - 13 ) . In fact , when logiEMP ) - MRATE is dropped from the more general model , the coefficient on MRATE becomes 1 - 396 , which is a trivial change from 1 - 390 , the ECONOMETRIC METHODS FOR FRACTIONAL RESPONSE VARL ^ BLES 631 estimate from equation ( 23 ) . The most significant interaction term is logiEMP ) - SOLE , with a / - statistic of - 3 . 48 ( robust / - statistic = - 3 - 47 ) . We report only equation ( 23 ) because of its simplicity and because it captures the economically important relationship between PRATE and MRATE . The full set of results is available on request from the authors . The basic story does not change when we estimate the models over the entire sample . One notable difference is that a quadratic term in MRATE is now significant in equation ( 23 ) , refiecting a faster diminishing effect at high match rates . Table III presents the same models as Table II , now estimated over the full sample . First consider the models without MRATE ^ . The discrepancy in r - squareds between equations ( 23 ) and ( 22 ) is even greater than before , but RESET now rejects both equations , although the logistic model is rejected less strongly . In columns ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) we put MRATE ^ into each equation . Model ( 22 ) is still soundly rejected , whereas ( 23 ) with MRATE ^ passes the RESET test with a p - value above 0 - 50 . For the full sample , it seems that a quadratic in MRATE —or some other way to capture additional non - linearities—is needed to provide a reasonable fit . Table III .

E . PAPKE AND J . M . WOOLDRIDGE Putting MRATE ^ into equation ( 23 ) has the usual drawback for quadratics : it implies an eventual negative marginal effect . In this case , the marginal effect becomes negative at a match rate of about 2 - 51 . This is a high value for MRATE , but there are some match rates this large in the full sample . 5 . CONCLUSION The functional forms offered in this paper are viable alternatives to linear models that use either y or the log - odds ratio of y as the dependent variable . No special data adjustments are needed for the extreme values of zero and one , and the conditional expectation of y given the explanatory variables is estimated directly . The quasi - likelihood method we propose is fully robust and relatively efficient under the GLM assumption ( 6 ) . The empirical application to 401 ( k ) plan participation rates illustrates the usefulness of these methods : while a linear model to explain the fraction of participants is strongly rejected , the logistic conditional mean specification is not . Methods for fractional dependent variables have many applications in economics . For example , Hausman and Leonard ( 1994 ) have recently applied the methods suggested here to estimate a model for Nielsen ratings for telecasts of NBA basketball games .
