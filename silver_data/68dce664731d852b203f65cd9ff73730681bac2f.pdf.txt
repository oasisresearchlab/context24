How it breaks membranes , though , remains unknown . Here , we characterize a sequential polymerization of ESCRT - III subunits that , driven by a recruitment cascade and by continuous subunit - turnover powered by the ATPase Vps4 , induces membrane deformation and ﬁssion . During this process , the exchange of Vps24 for Did2 induces a tilt in the polymer - membrane interface , which triggers transition from ﬂat spiral polymers to helical ﬁlament to drive the formation of membrane protrusions , and ends with the formation of a highly constricted Did2 - Ist1 co - polymer that we show is competent to promote ﬁssion when bound on the inside of membrane necks . Overall , our results suggest a mechanism of stepwise changes in ESCRT - III ﬁlament structure and mechanical properties via exchange of the ﬁlament subunits to catalyze ESCRT - III activity . INTRODUCTION Eukaryotic cells are characterized by a complex endomembrane system that requires membrane remodeling machineries for its maintenance and dynamics . While it is not known how this endo - membrane system evolved , it has been proposed that the endo - somal sorting complex required for transport - III ( ESCRT - III ) , which was presumably inherited from archaea during evolution , is essential to the emergence of endomembranes ( Baum and Baum , 2014 ) . Uniquely , ESCRT - III has the ability to catalyze membrane ﬁssion from within membrane necks and to function on virtually all cellular membranes : it catalyzes formation of intra - lumenal vesicles ( ILVs ) from the endosome membrane , cytoki - netic abscission of the plasma membrane , reformation of the nuclear envelope , and closure of autophagosomes ( Scho¨neberg et al . , 2017 ) . ESCRT - III - mediated membrane ﬁssion is also involved in the budding of various virions in eukaryotes and archaea and in repairing the plasma membrane as well as lyso - somal and nuclear membranes ( Vietri et al . , 2020 ) . This repair function was shown to help conﬁne bacterial pathogens to the host vacuole ( Vietri et al . , 2020 ) . Its ubiquitous role in vital cellular functions deﬁnes ESCRT - III as an essential membrane remodel - ing complex . Understanding how it performs its function is thus critical . Canonically recruited by ESCRT - II , ESCRT - III assembly starts with Vps20 followed by the core subunits Snf7 , Vps2 , and Vps24 . Vps2 and Vps24 bind Snf7 in tandem and then recruit the AAA - ATPase Vps4 ( Babst et al . , 2002 ; Obita et al . , 2007 ; Saksena et al . , 2009 ; Stuchell - Brereton et al . , 2007 ; Teis et al . , 2008 , 2010 ) , which induces subunit turnover within ESCRT - III promot - ing either polymer disassembly ( Adell et al . , 2014 ; Yang et al . , 2015 ) or growth ( Mierzwa et al . , 2017 ) . ESCRT - III subunits assemble into single - or multiple - stranded ﬁlaments , which exhibit high spontaneous curvature and low rigidity , leading to diverse shapes from spirals ( Chiaruttini et al . , 2015 ; Hanson et al . , 2008 ; Henne et al . , 2012 ; Shen et al . , 2014 ) to conical spi - rals ( Hanson et al . , 2008 ; McCullough et al . , 2015 ) and tubular helices ( Effantin et al . , 2013 ; Lata et al . , 2008 ) . To date , the mech - anism by which ESCRT - III polymers drive membrane remodeling remains unclear ( Chiaruttini and Roux , 2017 ) . However , many recent ﬁndings support the notion that ESCRT - III polymer re - modeling by Vps4 is required ( Adell et al . , 2017 ; Guizetti et al . , 2011 ; Mierzwa et al . , 2017 ) . Attempts to reconstitute membrane ﬁssion in vitro using ESCRT - III core subunits have led to conﬂicting reports regarding the role of Vps4 ( Scho¨neberg et al . , 2018 ; Wollert et al . , 2009 ) . Polymers observed with these subunits ( Snf7 , Vps2 , and Vps24 ) exceed radii of 15 nm ( Henne et al . , 2012 ; Lata et al . , ll OPEN ACCESS 1140 Cell 182 , 1140 – 1155 , September 3 , 2020 Crown Copyright ª 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc .

A B C D E F ( legend on next page ) ll OPEN ACCESS Cell 182 , 1140 – 1155 , September 3 , 2020 1141 Article 2008 ; Mierzwa et al . , 2017 ; Shen et al . , 2014 ) . While further constriction can be achieved by the addition of Vps4 ( Maity et al . , 2019 ) , these dimensions remain far from the theoretical limit of 3 nm required for spontaneous ﬁssion ( Kozlovsky and Ko - zlov , 2002 ) . This suggests that additional factors or mechanisms are at play in ESCRT - III - dependent membrane ﬁssion . Aside from the core ESCRT - III proteins , accessory ESCRT - III proteins have been proposed to play roles in the context of spe - ciﬁc ESCRT - III functions ( Scho¨neberg et al . , 2017 ) . Two of these , CHMP1 and IST1 , contribute to many ESCRT - dependent processes and have a strong loss - of - function abscission pheno - type ( Agromayor et al . , 2009 ; Bajorek et al . , 2009a , 2009b ; Xiao et al . , 2009 ) . Likewise , a knockout of Did2 ( yeast CHMP1 homo - log ) results in cargo sorting defects similar to those observed upon depletion of ESCRT - III core subunits ( Brune et al . , 2019 ; Nickerson et al . , 2006 ; Talledge et al . , 2018 ) . CHMP1B - IST1 co - polymers also form the tightest ESCRT - III helices and are able to constrict membrane tubules ( McCullough et al . , 2015 ; Nguyen et al . , 2020 ) . These observations point to a more impor - tant , yet unrecognized , role of Did2 / CHMP1 and Ist1 / IST1 in ESCRT - III function . RESULTS ESCRT - III Subunits Undergo Cascade - like Recruitment To study how ESCRT - III polymers recruit Did2 and Ist1 , we incu - bated Alexa488 - Snf7 - patches grown on supported lipid bilayers ( Chiaruttini et al . , 2015 ; Figure 1A ) with Atto565 - Did2 or Atto565 - Ist1 and varying combinations of ESCRT - III subunits at equi - molar concentrations ( Figures S1A – S1D ) . Like Vps2 and Vps24 , which bind Snf7 as an obligatory dimer ( Mierzwa et al . , 2017 ) , Did2 was co - recruited with Vps2 to Snf7 - patches sug - gesting that Vps2 and Did2 form a novel Snf7 - binding sub - com - plex , a notion supported by recent genetic studies ( Brune et al . , 2019 ; Heinzle et al . , 2019 ) . Did2 - binding was , however , strongly enhanced by Vps24 . Consistently with its known afﬁnity for Did2 , Ist1 recruitment mirrored that of Did2 , in that it was recruited with Vps2 - Did2 and bound most efﬁciently to Snf7 - patches in the presence of Vps2 - Vps24 - Did2 ( Figures S1C and S1D ) . Alto - gether , these ﬁndings indicate that ESCRT - III subunits are orga - nized in a recruitment cascade : membrane - bound Snf7 recruits Vps2 - Vps24 , which recruits Vps2 - Did2 , which then recruits Ist1 ( Figure 1B ) . This led us to wonder about the binding dynamics of the different subunits . Thus , we extracted kymographs of each subunit from midsections of pre - grown Snf7 - patches after simultaneous addition of all subunits ( Figure 1C ) . Strikingly , the recruitment dynamics of the subunits followed the same order expected from our afﬁnity study ( Figure 1B ) . Vps2 and Did2 Form an Snf7 Binding Complex To better characterize Vps2 - Did2 , the most poorly described ESCRT - III sub - complex , we performed negative stain electron microscopy of Snf7 - coated liposomes incubated with Vps2 , Vps24 , and Did2 ( Figure 1D ) . As previously reported ( Chiaruttini et al . , 2015 ; Mierzwa et al . , 2017 ) , Snf7 formed single - stranded spirals , which upon addition of Vps2 and Vps24 , transitioned into multimers of double - stranded spirals suggesting a lateral co - polymerization ( see STAR Methods ) . Interestingly , the further addition of Vps2 - Did2 resulted in the formation of three - stranded spirals indicating that Vps2 - Did2 forms a third ﬁlament along Snf7 - ( Vps2 - Vps24 ) ﬁlaments ( Figure 1D ) . Strikingly , intertwined multi - stranded spiral - like polymers formed upon addition of Vps2 - Did2 alone to Snf7 - spirals demonstrating that Vps2 - Did2 is sufﬁcient to induce Snf7 ﬁlament bundling ( Figure S1E ) . To better understand how Did2 - Vps2 and Vps24 - Vps2 interact within ESCRT - III polymers , Snf7 - patches were incubated with Vps2 , Atto565 - Did2 , and increasing concentrations of Vps24 . Consistent with the Vps24 - mediated enhancement of Did2 - Vps2 co - recruitment ( Figures S1A and S1B ) , the Did2 binding rate and level of recruitment were the highest when Vps2 , Vps24 , and Did2 were added at stoichiometric ratios of 2 : 1 : 1 ( Figures S1F and S1G ) . Conversely , higher concentrations of Vps24 reduced binding of Did2 to Snf7 - patches . Because competitive binding between Vps24 and Did2 for Vps2 seems unlikely in a scenario where Vps24 also participates in Did2 recruitment , the inhibition of Did2 - binding likely resulted from depletion of Vps2 from the soluble protein pool by binding to Vps24 . Because formation of a Did2 - homopolymer on top of pre - existing Snf7 - ( Vps2 - Vps24 ) ﬁlaments should not be affected by depletion of free Vps2 , the inhibition of Did2 - binding upon Vps2 - depletion strongly suggests that Did2 is recruited to ESCRT - III as Did2 - Vps2 heterodimers . Because Snf7 - Vps2 - Vps24 - Did2 forms three - stranded ﬁlaments , while Snf7 is sufﬁ - cient to recruit Vps2 - Did2 , and Vps2 - Vps24 enhances Did2 recruitment , we think that Vps2 - Did2 forms a heteropolymer that interacts with both Snf7 and Vps2 - Vps24 ﬁlaments ( Fig - ure 1D ) . We further speculate that the three strands observed in Snf7 - Vps2 - Vps24 - Did2 spirals are formed by a sequential Figure 1 .

Consistent with this sequence , Did2 did not affect Vps2 - Vps24 binding to Snf7 ( Figure S1H ) . Because Did2 appears to have similar interactions with ESCRT - III subunits as Vps24 , we next compared the functional properties of Vps2 - Did2 and Vps2 - Vps24 . First , we tested Vps2 - Did2 for its ability to inhibit Snf7 polymerization , a well described feature of Vps2 - Vps24 ( Mierzwa et al . , 2017 ; Teis et al . , 2008 ) . Although addition of Vps2 - Vps24 arrested growing Snf7 - patches , Snf7 - patches still grew slowly in presence of Vps2 - Did2 ( Figure 1E ) . This partial inhibition of growth could arise because Vps2 - Did2 is only a weak inhibitor of Snf7 polymeriza - tion , or because Vps2 - Did2 has a relatively low afﬁnity for Snf7 polymers ( Figure 1C ) . To discriminate these two possibilities , Snf7 - patches were saturated with Vps2 - Did2 in absence of free Snf7 , before free Snf7 was re - introduced . In this case , growth was fully inhibited ( Figure 1E ) . The addition of Vps2 - Vps24 - Did2 inhibited growth as efﬁciently as Vps2 - Vps24 ( Figure S1I ) . These results indicate that Vps2 - Did2 , like Vps2 - Vps24 , can fully inhibit Snf7 polymerization . However , presumably because of its lower afﬁnity for Snf7 , Vps2 - Did2 does not reach sufﬁcient stoichiom - etry in the copolymer to fully inhibit Snf7 polymerization . Most likely , this partial inhibition of Snf7 polymerization by Vps2 - Did2 explains the large variation in size and number of strands observed in Snf7 - Vps2 - Did2 spirals ( Figure S1E ) . The second function of Vps2 - Vps24 is to recruit Vps4 , which promotes disas - sembly of ESCRT - III in absence of free Snf7 . Interestingly , Vps2 - Did2 promoted disassembly of Snf7 - patches more efﬁciently than Vps2 - Vps24 ( Figure 1F ) . When both Vps24 and Did2 were present in equimolar amounts , Did2 dominated the disassembly dynamics ( Figure 1F ) . These results show that Vps2 - Vps24 and Vps2 - Did2 , although having seemingly redundant functions in ESCRT - III assembly , possess functional specializations , with Vps2 - Vps24 having a stronger afﬁnity for Snf7 - polymers , whereas Vps2 - Did2 stimulates Vps4 more efﬁciently . Vps4 Exchanges Vps2 - Vps24 for Vps2 - Did2 within ESCRT - III Polymers Because Vps2 - Vps24 and Vps2 - Did2 are sequentially recruited to Snf7 - patches , we wondered if their disassembly also follows a ﬁxed order . Thus , we monitored Vps24 and Did2 levels upon Vps4 - triggered disassembly of Snf7 - ( Atto565 - Did2 ) - ( Alexa488 - Vps24 ) - Vps2 - patches . Interestingly , Vps24 promptly disas - sembled upon addition of Vps4 / ATP , whereas Did2 intensity initially increased on Snf7 - patches ( Figure 2A ) suggesting that Vps4 exchanges Vps24 for Did2 in Vps2 heteropolymers . To test this , the disassembly of Snf7 - ( Alexa488 - Vps24 ) - ( Atto565 - Vps2 ) - patches was monitored in the presence and absence of Did2 , and the ratio of Vps24 and Vps2 ﬂuorescence intensities ( Vps24 / Vps2 ratio ) was observed . Similar experiments were performed using Snf7 - Vps24 - ( Alexa488 - Vps2 ) - ( Atto565 - Did2 ) - patches to assess the Did2 / Vps2 ratio . Intriguingly , the Vps24 / Vps2 ratio decreased upon Vps4 - induced subunit - turnover in presence of Did2 , whereas it remained stable when Did2 was missing ( Figure 2B ) . Conversely , the Did2 / Vps2 ratio initially increased and then plateaued , implying that Vps24 is ﬁrst exchanged for Did2 ( initial phase ) ( Figure 2B ) , before the Did2 - Vps2 ﬁlament disassembled ( plateau ) . Taken together , these ﬁndings reveal the exchange of subunits within a persistent ESCRT - III polymer that is driven by the different biochemical properties of the subunits themselves . Due to its stronger afﬁnity for Snf7 , Vps24 - Vps2 is recruited ﬁrst to Snf7 - patches . Vps24 is then exchanged for Did2 , which stimulates Vps4 activity to re - move Snf7 while Vps2 remains stably bound at the membrane . These dynamics are in good agreement with data from yeast in which Vps24 and Snf7 accumulated in the did2 D mutant ( Nicker - son et al . , 2006 ) . Vps2 - Vps24 versus Vps2 - Did2—Should I Shrink or Should I Grow ? When recruited by Vps2 - Vps24 , Vps4 induces subunit - turnover driving the growth of Snf7 - patches in presence of free Snf7 ( Mierzwa et al . , 2017 ) . By contrast , the recruitment of Vps4 by Vps2 - Did2 promotes the disassembly of Snf7 - patches ( Fig - ure 2C ) . These ﬁndings indicate that Vps2 - Vps24 and Vps2 - Did2 have opposing effects on the growth and disassembly of Snf7 - polymers . Because the ratio between Vps24 and Did2 in ESCRT - III assemblies changes over time ( Figures 1C and 2B ) , we asked if the overall growth or depolymerization rate was controlled by the Vps24 / Did2 molar ratio . To address this issue , we monitored the outcome ( growth or disassembly ) of Alex488 - Snf7 - Vps2 - patches incubated with varying ratios of Vps24 / Did2 upon addition of Vps4 / ATP . Thrillingly , Snf7 turnover dynamics could be shifted from growth to disassembly by decreasing the Vps24 / Did2 ratio in presence of free Snf7 ( Figure 2D ) . We envi - sion that a growing Snf7 - polymer ﬁrst recruits Vps2 - Vps24 due to it higher afﬁnity . Vps2 - Vps24 then recruits Vps4 , which upon low stimulation promotes polymer growth and exchanges Vps24 for Did2 . Increasing levels of Did2 slowly recruit and stim - ulate Vps4 so that , once the Vps24 / Did2 ratio falls below a critical value , highly active Vps4 triggers the disassembly of Snf7 - polymers . Sequential Disassembly of ESCRT - III Subunits The demonstration that the Vps24 / Did2 ratio controls the growth dynamics of ESCRT - III assemblies suggests a sequential pathway of polymer disassembly ( Figure 2 ) . To monitor the Vps4 - mediated disassembly dynamics of individual subunits within multi - subunit ESCRT - III assemblies , we added Vps4 / ATP to Snf7 - patches pre - incubated with saturating levels of Vps2 - Vps24 - Did2 - Ist1 ( Figure 3A ) , while maintaining the soluble pool of all subunits . Interestingly , subunits disassembled sequentially : Snf7 and Vps24 depolymerized rapidly , Vps2 dis - assembled with a delay , while Did2 and Ist1 remain stably bound to the assemblies . The delay in Vps2 - disassembly was depen - dent on Did2 ( Figure 3B ) and is most likely mediated by the for - mation of a stabilizing Vps2 - Did2 complex upon exchange of Vps24 with Did2 ( Figure 2B ) . Furthermore , Did2 depolymerized in absence of soluble Ist1 but remained at the patches when Ist1 was present ( Figure S1J ) . To further study this process , we switched colors of soluble pools of Did2 or Ist1 before addition of Vps4 / ATP by replacing Atto488 - labeled with Atto565 - labeled Did2 or Ist1 ( Figure 3C ) . Although Ist1 continuously exchanged with its soluble pool , Did2 did not . Previous structural studies ll OPEN ACCESS Cell 182 , 1140 – 1155 , September 3 , 2020 1143 Article suggested that , due to steric hindrance , CHMP1B ( mammalian Did2 homolog ) binds either IST1 or Spastin , an ATPase similar to Vps4 ( Obita et al . , 2007 ; Stuchell - Brereton et al . , 2007 ; Tall - edge et al . , 2018 ; Xiao et al . , 2009 ) . This led to the idea that Ist1 could prevent Did2 disassembly by masking its Vps4 bind - ing - site . Consistently , Did2 disassembly could be induced by decreasing the Ist1 / Vps4 molar ratio ( Figure 3C ) , demonstrating that Ist1 binding competes with Vps4 - triggered Did2 disas - sembly . In this way , Ist1 protects Did2 from depolymerization . In summary , our results indicate that a cascade of subunit recruitment is followed by a Vps4 - driven sequential polymer disassembly . This suggests the possibility that ESCRT - III func - tion is based on a speciﬁc sequence of subunit recruitment and exchange . To test this hypothesis , we set out to reconstitute this assembly sequence in vitro . Vps4 Drives a Polymerization Sequence of ESCRT - III Subunits To provide a nucleation platform for all subunits , we grew Snf7 - patches to which Snf7 - Vps24 - Vps2 - Did2 - Ist1 - Vps4 / ATP were added in a molar ratio of 2 : 1 : 0 . 8 : 1 . 5 : 1 : 1 . 5 respectively , resem - bling the experimentally estimated abundance of ESCRT - III sub - units ( 1 . 7 : 1 : N / A : 1 . 3 : 2 . 5 : 2 . 8 [ Ghaemmaghami et al . , 2003 ] and 2 . 5 : 1 : 1 : N / A : N / A : N / A [ Teis et al . , 2008 ] ; Figures 4A and S2A ) . For the analysis of subunit dynamics , we imaged Alexa488 - Snf7 with one Atto565 - labeled subunit and then normalized the sequence using Snf7 dynamics as reference ( Figure S2A ; STAR Methods ) . Alexa488 - Ist1 was normalized against Atto565 - Vps2 for technical reasons . Immediately after addition of all subunits , Snf7 - patches started to grow , accompanied by strong Vps24 recruitment to A B C D Figure 2 .

These results demonstrate that ESCRT - III is a dynamic polymer that , after nucleation , spontane - ously undergoes a Vps4 - driven sequence of assembly and A C B Figure 3 .

We ﬁnd that the initial Snf7 structure primarily recruit Vps2 - Vps24 , because of its high afﬁnity for Snf7 . Vps2 - Vps24 , in turn , recruits Vps4 , which promotes ﬁlament growth upon low stimulation via Vps2 - Vps24 . As increasing levels of Did2 further stimulate Vps4 activ - ity , highly sensitive Snf7 and Vps24 ﬁlaments then disassemble rapidly , while Vps2 depolymerizes with a delay and Did2 , pro - tected from disassembly by Ist1 , accumulates . Importantly , these sequential changes in ﬁlament composition all occur in the presence of a soluble pool of free subunits , indicating that the observed assembly and disassembly are unidirectional . The ESCRT - III recruitment sequence we describe here has never been observed before , probably because Did2 and Ist1 , which step in later in the sequence than Vps2 , Vps24 , and Snf7 , were omitted from similar experiments ( Adell et al . , 2017 ; Bleck et al . , 2014 ) . When ESCRT - III recruitment to endosomes was triggered by hypertonic shock in mammalian cells ( Mercier et al . , 2019 ) , we observed a delayed recruitment of IST1 relative to CHMP4B ( Snf7 homolog ) ( Figures 4B and S2B ) , indicating that asimilar sequence ofESCRT - III recruitment eventsoccurs invivo during triggered ESCRT - III activity . In vitro , one cycle of ESCRT - III assembly and disassembly took several minutes , which is longer than ILVs formation or viral budding but shorter than abscission ( Adell et al . , 2017 ; Bleck et al . , 2014 ; Christ et al . , 2016 ; Guizetti et al . , 2011 ; Johnson et al . , 2018 ) . Because mem - brane curvature in our supported bilayer assay and at the cyto - kinetic bridge is much smaller than that found at the neck of ILV buds , we speculate that membrane curvature could inﬂu - ence the kinetics of subunit recruitment and turnover . Interestingly , when Ist1 and Vps4 were present in equal amounts in vitro , Ist1 and Did2 saturated at the membrane , while disassembly occurred when more Vps4 was added ( Figure 4C ) . This implies that changing the balance between Ist1 - dependent Did2 - stabilization and Vps4 - induced Did2 - disassembly during the polymerization sequence could allow , ﬁrst , the formation of Did2 - Ist1 polymers , followed by their subsequent disassembly . When Vps4 targets besides Did2 and Ist1 are present ( e . g . , Vps2 ) , Ist1 - mediated Did2 - protection outcompetes Vps4 , resulting in the depletion of Vps2 while Did2 remains on the membrane . It is only when Did2 - Ist1 are alone that Vps4 can overcome Ist1 - mediated Did2 - protection to promote Did2 disassembly . Similarly , following recruitment in vivo , IST1 re - mained on endosomes , whereas CHMP4B was disassembled ( Figure 4B ) , as was seen in vitro in the presence of low Vps4 / Ist1 ratios . We speculate that global ESCRT - III recruitment might diminish the cytosolic pool of Vps4 and thereby inhibit disas - sembly of IST1 . Taken together , these data indicate recycling of ESCRT - III after membrane ﬁssion might occur via a shift in polymer composition that changes the outcome of competitive binding between Ist1 and Vps4 . Sequential Polymerization of ESCRT - III Drives Membrane Deformation Upon Vps4 - induced disassembly of ESCRT - III polymers on deformable membrane , we observed formation of bright puncta accumulating Atto565 - Vps2 , Atto565 - Did2 , Atto565 - Ist1 , the membrane marker Atto647N - dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanol - amine ( DOPE ) , and temporarily , Alexa488 - Snf7 ( Figure 4D ) . Because this accumulation of Atto647N - DOPE puncta could represent local membrane deformation , we analyzed liposomes coated with various ESCRT - III subunits by negative - stain and freeze - fracture electron microscopy . Incubation with Snf7 alone , Snf7 - Vps2 - Vps24 , or Snf7 - Vps2 - Vps24 - Vps4 / ATP yielded ﬂat spiral - ﬁlaments ( Figures 5A and S3A ) . The addition of Did2 resulted in a moderate 3D - deformation of spiral - ﬁlaments ( diam - eter , 31 . 5 nm ± 6 . 8 nm ) ( Figure 5A ) and modest membrane defor - mations ( diameter , 53 nm ± 12 . 8nm ) ( Figure 5A ) . Supplementing the mixture with Vps4 / ATP , caused massive 3D - deformations of ﬁlaments , characterized by tubular structures protruding from the spiral center ( diameter , 16 . 3 nm ± 3 . 5 nm ) ( Figure 5A ) . The corresponding membrane deformations frequently extended deep inside vesicles , eventually breaking during the fracturing procedure . Consistently , negative stain of the inner leaf ﬂat of burst vesicles revealed membrane protrusions expanding to - ward the inside of vesicles ( 22 . 1 nm ± 3 . 2 nm ) ( Figure 5A ) . We presume that these membrane protrusions are formed by the observed protein ﬁlaments and two layers of membrane bilayers ( ca . 4 nm each ) . Altogether , we show that Did2 incorporation into ESCRT - III ﬁlaments promotes their 3D - deformation , which trig - gers formation of inward - directed membrane protrusions . Because Vps4 promotes efﬁcient disassembly of Snf7 and Vps24 from polymers , whereas Vps2 - Did2 structures remain , this boost in membrane deformation by Vps4 is likely due to a shift in polymer composition . A recent computational model , in which driven sequential changes in the polymer orientation relative to the membrane caused ﬂat spirals to transition into conical and helical polymers , could explain how a shift in polymer properties imposed by changes in its composition might drive ﬁlament deformation ( Harker - Kirschneck et al . , 2019 ) .

This observed twist in the helical structure corresponds to the tilt of each subunit imposed in the simulations . We therefore extended the earlier model ( Harker - Kirschneck et al . , 2019 ) to include staged assembly / disassembly of multiple ﬁlaments as observed in our experiments ( Figure 5A ) . First , we modeled the recruitment of tilted ( helical ) Vps2 - Did2 polymers to the ﬂat membrane - bound spirals ( Snf7 - Vps2 - Vps24 ) before simulating removal of the ﬂat ﬁlament . Note that for these simulations , we chose to use two - stranded ﬁlaments to mimic the initial recruitment of Vps2 - Vps24 , and the subsequent Vps4 - dependent switch to Vps2 - Did2 within ESCRT - III assemblies . Strikingly , the binding of a helical ﬁlament to a ﬂat spiral ﬁla - ment resulted in the formation of conical structures ( Figure 5C ) . Upon disassembly of the ﬂat ﬁlament , we then observed a rapid transition from a conical to an extended helical ﬁlament . As observed in our experiments , these changes in ﬁlament organi - zation were associated with deformation of the underlying mem - brane ﬁrst into shallow membrane dimple upon the recruitment of the second polymer , and then tubular membrane protrusion upon removal of the ﬁrst ﬁlament ( Figures 5A and 5C ) . Interest - ingly , membrane deformation by the conical copolymers de - pended on the relative stiffness and membrane afﬁnity of the two ﬁlaments . Although ﬁlaments with equivalent mechanical properties induced a clear membrane deformation , the deforma - tion was less pronounced if the second ﬁlament was less stiff than the ﬁrst one ( Figure S4A ) . Reduction of the membrane afﬁn - ity of the second ﬁlament further decreased the membrane invagination depth ( Figure S4A ) . In summary , these results combining dynamic , structural , and simulation approaches strongly indicate that , by inducing the sequential assembly and disassembly of two polymer strands with orthogonal mem - brane - binding interfaces , ﬂat ESCRT - III spirals can transition into ﬁrst conical spirals ( ﬁlament recruitment ) before buckling into helical polymers ( ﬁlament removal ) accompanied by mem - brane deformation into ﬁrst shallow membrane dimples and then deeper membrane invaginations . Ist1 Binding Promotes Membrane Constriction and Fission Next , we examined the role of Ist1 by incubating Did2 - mediated inward protrusions with Ist1 . Strikingly , protrusions constricted from 22 . 1 nm ± 3 . 2 nm ( Figure 5A ) without Ist1 to 12 . 1 nm ± 1 . 8 nm when Ist1 was present ( Figures 6A and S3B ) . To further characterize this constriction , we used membrane - bound Vps2 - Did2 copolymers , which form outward tubular structures with a pearled appearance and helical collars . The diameter of these collars ( 20 . 1 nm ± 2 nm ) ( Figures 6B , 6C , and S3C ) were comparable to the inward membrane protrusions ( Figure 5A ) . When both , Ist1 and Vps4 / ATP , were added in solution , the col - lars appeared to constrict in between bulges ( 13 . 5 nm ± 3 . 5 nm ) with a spread distribution of diameters as expected for ﬁlaments undergoing a gradual asynchronous constriction . Based on our previous observations , Vps4 most likely depletes Vps2 from the ESCRT - polymer thereby establishing a tighter Did2 - Ist1 - polymer , fully consistent with a recent report of IST1 - driven constriction of CHMP1B - polymers and the underlying mem - brane by structural subunit elongation ( Nguyen et al . , 2020 ) . Intriguingly , when membrane tubes were pre - absorbed onto EM grids before Vps4 / ATP - treatment , Vps4 - triggered polymer constriction led to tubule scission , as revealed by rows of aligned vesicles ( Figures 6D and 6E ) . This suggests a role for tension in ESCRT - III - mediated ﬁssion , similar to dynamin - mediated ﬁssion ( Danino et al . , 2004 ; Morlot et al . , 2012 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ) . To further test the ﬁssion efﬁciency of the Did2 - Ist1 complex , we separated liposomes and small vesicles formed during ESCRT - III action by centrifugation , an assay previously used to test membrane ﬁssion by amphipathic helices ( Boucrot et al . , 2012 ) . Only when liposomes were treated with Vps2 - Did2 - Ist1 - Vps4 / ATP small vesicles accumulated in the supernatant ( Fig - ures 6F and S3D ) substantiating the notion that Ist1 - induced constriction leads to ﬁssion . A caveat of these experiments , however , is that ESCRT - III - mediated ﬁssion occurs in the reverse orientation relative to most instances of ESCRT - III func - tion in vivo , where subunits are found within the membrane neck . Thus , we set out to develop an assay that would enable us to investigate ESCRT - III - mediated ﬁssion with the reverse orientation . ESCRT - III Polymerization Sequence Can Fission Membrane Necks In Vitro A powerful assay to test recruitment of protein as a function of positive and negative curvature is pulling membrane tubes from giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) ( Simunovic et al . , 2017 ) . In this assay , streptavidin - coated beads are put in contact with an immobilized GUV containing exposed biotin moieties , and a tube is pulled by moving the bead trapped in optical tweezers . Tubes can be pulled outward the GUV , or inward the GUV ( Das - gupta and Dimova , 2014 ) . In the latter case , glass beads are nearly completely engulfed by the GUV membrane , because of Figure 5 .

As reported previ - ously , Snf7 did not polymerize on tubes pulled outward with a radius smaller than 35 nm ( Figure S5A ; Chiaruttini et al . , 2015 ) . Unexpectedly , Snf7 was also unable to bind to tubes pulled inward below a threshold radius of 115 nm ( Figure S5A ) . The addition of ESCRT - II and Vps20 , which were previously sug - gested to trigger the binding of Vps32 ( C . elegans Snf7 homolog ) or CHMP4B ( human Snf7 homolog ) to curved membranes ( Fyfe et al . , 2011 ; Lee et al . , 2015 ) , partially restored binding on posi - tively curved tubes smaller than 35 nm as large Snf7 structures formed , but had no effect on binding of Snf7 to negatively curved tubes . We reasoned that the unidirectional curvature of tubes might prevent Snf7 binding . Necks have a prototypical saddle - like structure , in which both positive and negative curvatures come into play . To reproduce this saddle - like membrane archi - tecture , instead of pulling engulfed glass beads into GUVs to form membrane tubes , we added ESCRT - III subunits to necks connecting engulfed beads to GUV membranes . At these necks , ESCRT - III nucleators ESCRT - II and Vps20 triggered site - spe - ciﬁc nucleation of Snf7 - structures ( Figures 7A and S5C ) . These ﬁndings suggest that a curvature - sensitive nucleation and a cur - vature - sensitive inhibition of Snf7 - polymer growth could help position polymerization of ESCRT - III polymers within neck structures . To test if the ESCRT - III polymerization sequence we discov - ered on ﬂat supported bilayers also occurs at these neck struc - tures , we added mixtures of Vps2 - Vps24 - Did2 - Ist1 - Vps4 / ATP to pre - grown ESCRT - II - Vps20 - Snf7 necks . As expected , Vps2 , Did2 , and Ist1 were recruited , and we observed disassembly of Snf7 , while Did2 and Ist1 remained at membrane necks upon Vps4 / ATP - induced subunit - turnover ( Figures 7B and S6A – S6E ) . We next tested if the ESCRT - III polymerization sequence can trigger ﬁssion of these membrane necks . To do so , engulfed beads with pre - grown Snf7 necks were incubated with various mixtures of ESCRT - III subunits before beads were pulled inside the vesicle using optical tweezers ( Figures 7C and S6F ) . Beads that instantly retracted to the membrane when released because of a membrane tube , and beads that could not be pulled in , were both scored as non - ﬁssion events . Only beads that , after being pulled and released , remained in the GUV center were scored as ﬁssion events . In this regard , it should be noted that in previous attempts to monitor ESCRT - III - mediated ﬁssion based on out - ward tube pulling , tube detachment due to rupture of the DOPE - biotin - streptavidin association could erroneously be confused with membrane ﬁssion ( Scho¨neberg et al . , 2018 ) . In contrast , in our assay , internalization of beads into the GUV signi - ﬁed by free diffusion of beads wrapped in ﬂuorescent membrane could only occur by ﬁssion of the membrane neck . ESCRT - II and Vps20 were required in these experiments for the site - speciﬁc nucleation of Snf7 - polymers at the neck structures ( Figure S5C ) . In absence of all ESCRT - subunits , 95 . 2 % of the beads did not undergo ﬁssion . In contrast , ﬁssion occurred with 27 . 5 % efﬁciency when ESCRT - II - Vps20 - Snf7 - Vps2 - Vps24 - Vps4 / ATP was added . Strikingly , the ﬁssion efﬁciency was dramatically increased , up to 72 . 8 % , when both Did2 and Ist1 were added to the mix . This demonstrates the importance of Did2 and Ist1 for ESCRT - III - catalyzed membrane ﬁssion in the physiologically relevant orientation . Our data strongly support the notion that Vps4 - catalyzed sequential conversion of Snf7 - Vps2 - Vps24 polymers to Did2 - Ist1 polymers induces enough constriction of ESCRT - III assemblies to promote efﬁcient membrane ﬁssion . DISCUSSION In this study , we report the discovery of a Vps4 - driven polymer - ization sequence of ESCRT - III subunits that promotes mem - brane deformation and ﬁssion ( Figures 7D and S7 ) . Our analysis reveals three essential features of the ESCRT - III - mediated mem - brane ﬁssion reaction . First , we show that membrane deforma - tion is coupled to changes of ﬁlament shape associated with changes of subunits stoichiometry . Second , we identify the last complex in the sequence , Did2 - Ist1 , as competent to pro - mote membrane ﬁssion , and third , we show that the sequence orients the polymerization of ESCRT - III within membrane necks . Because the number and the redundancy of ESCRT - III subunits are highly variable between species , the molecular sequence we identiﬁed with yeast proteins may be different in other species . However , we expect these three central principles to be com - mon to all . In clathrin - mediated endocytosis , the sequence of subunit recruitment ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) is also coupled to membrane deformation . However , while semi - recon - stituted assays established its dependence on ATP ( Wu et al . , 2010 ) , this sequence has never been reconstituted in vitro . Thus , the ESCRT - III sequence we identiﬁed here is the ﬁrst example of the in vitro reconstitution of a membrane remodeling process driven by sequential protein recruitment . Such a pathway had been postulated before from biochemical studies ( Henne et al . , 2012 ; Saksena et al . , 2009 ; Teis et al . , 2008 ) , but it was never directly observed . Our study deﬁnes three essential parameters to control the temporal order of the sequence : the subunit afﬁnity for the membrane , the speciﬁc afﬁnity between subunits , as the preceding subunits recruit the subsequent , and the role of Vps4 which , by fueling the subunit turnover , drives unidirectional progression . These principal aspects of the ESCRT - III polymerization sequence are different from the cla - thrin endocytic sequence , where membrane curvature and phosphoinositide metabolism are crucial ( Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ) . In our study , although membrane curvature may inﬂuence the dynamics of the sequence , we reconstituted the sequence onto non - deformable supported bilayers showing that curvature is not critical for driving the sequence . We previously proposed , based on theoretical work ( Lenz et al . , 2009 ) , that the ﬂat Snf7 - spirals buckle to induce curvature Snf7 + Vps2 + Vps24 + Vps4 / ATP : n = 4 , ROI = 110 ; Snf7 + Vps2 + Vps24 + Ist1 + Vps4 / ATP : n = 3 , ROI = 105 ; Snf7 + Vps2 + Vps24 + Did2 + Vps4 / ATP : n = 3 , ROI = 48 ; Snf7 + Vps2 + Vps24 + Did2 + Ist1 + Vps4 : n = 3 , ROI = 73 ; Snf7 + Vps2 + Vps24 + Did2 + Ist1 + Vps4 / ATP : n = 6 , ROI = 133 ; mean ± SD . ( D ) Model of the coupling between ESCRT - III recruitment sequence and membrane remodeling activities ( see also Figure S7 ) . See also Figure S5 . ll OPEN ACCESS 1152 Cell 182 , 1140 – 1155 , September 3 , 2020 Article ( Chiaruttini et al . , 2015 ) . While Snf7 ﬁlaments have all properties ( growth and elasticity ) to buckle , we never observed tubular pro - trusions with Snf7 ﬁlaments . Here , using both molecular dy - namics simulations and experimental data , we ﬁnd that the buckling transition is likely induced by the recruitment of ESCRT - III subunits that change the ﬁlament architecture . First addition of Vps2 - Vps24 , forms a secondary ﬁlament along Snf7 ﬁlaments ( Mierzwa et al . , 2017 ) and thereby rigidiﬁes the polymer increasing its potential to buckle spontaneously ( Henne et al . , 2012 ; Moser von Filseck et al . , 2020 ) . Subsequently , the exchange of Vps24 to Did2 results in the formation of conical spirals . Finally , Vps4 - mediated ﬁlament - removal triggers the formation of helical ﬁlaments . At the molecular level , we show that sequential assembly and disassembly of copolymers consisting of a ﬂat ( Snf7 ) and a helical ( Vps2 - Did2 ) ﬁlament mediate this buckling transition . Our simulations demonstrate that this depends on the two ﬁlaments having a different tilt in their membrane binding interface , relative to the main axis of the ﬁlament . The ﬁnal Did2 - Ist1 - assembly in the sequence , which was shown to constrict membrane tubes to 4 . 8 nm from their outside ( Nguyen et al . , 2020 ) , is the only ESCRT - III polymer identiﬁed so far that is compatible with constriction sizes that lead to ﬁssion . However , the exact dimensions of the pre - ﬁssion intermediate constituted of Did2 - Ist1 are not known , and its structure may differ from the equilibrium state presented in Nguyen et al . ( 2020 ) . Furthermore , we ﬁnd that Vps4 activity is required for constriction and ﬁssion . Thus , the ATPase might play a role in ﬁssion beyond establishment of the Did2 - Ist1 polymer . Similar to dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion ( Roux et al . , 2006 ) , additional external forces might be required to ﬁnalize the pro - gression from highly constricted membrane structures toward ﬁssion . Possible origins of such forces during ESCRT - III activity could be protein - and cargo - crowding in ILV formation or cell migration in abscission . Did2 - Ist1 can assemble around or inside membrane necks in vivo ( Allison et al . , 2013 ) and in vitro ( McCul - lough et al . , 2015 ) and induce ﬁssion in both orientations ( our study ) . Understanding how the same complex , in different orien - tation , still constricts the membrane sufﬁciently to trigger ﬁssion , and whether other important players , such as cargoes ( Mages - waran et al . , 2015 ) , are essential for ﬁssion , remains an open question for future studies . To conclude , in this study , we ﬁnd the principles of ESCRT - III activity to be an ATP - driven sequential subunit assembly and disassembly ( polymerization sequence ) that induces changes in ESCRT - III - polymer properties to trigger two steps of shape transitions : ﬁrst , ﬁlament buckling ( promoting membrane defor - mation ) and then ﬁlament constriction ( promoting membrane ﬁssion ) . The same principles have been suggested to apply to ESCRT - mediated abscission during archaea cytokinesis ( Risa et al . , 2019 ) . Here , a ring formed of CdvB ( archaeal ESCRT - III homolog ) recruits two other homologs CdvB1 and CdvB2 . Removal of CdvB then allows the constriction of the remaining CdvB1 / 2 ring that promotes membrane ﬁssion . These sequential changes in ESCRT - III ﬁlament structure that accompany mem - brane scission appear remarkably similar to the ﬁlament constriction pathway we observe here ( Figure 6 ) . Together with our mammalian cell data , these two in vivo examples highlight how conserved the common principles of ESCRT - III activity discovered in this study are . While the subunit composition of the ESCRT - III ﬁlaments may vary from species to species , and from one cellular function to another , the common principles of a sequence of subunit exchanges , that shifts the architecture and mechanical properties of ESCRT - III ﬁlaments , knock together a general mechanism by which ESCRT - III remodels membranes .

They were authenticated by Microsynth ( Balgach , Switzerland ) , which revealed 100 % identity to the DNA proﬁle of the cell line HeLa ( ATCC : CCL - 2 ) and 100 % identity over all 15 autosomal STRs to the Microsynth’s reference DNA proﬁle of HeLa . We obtained HeLa Kyoto cells stably expressing Ist1 - mCherry from Harald Stenmark ( Vietri et al . , 2015 ) . HeLa Kyoto cells are female . HeLa Kyoto cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and 2 % penicillin - streptomycin at 37 (cid:1) C and 5 % CO 2 . We used Rosetta2 E . coli for protein production . Bacteria were cultured in LB - medium at 37 (cid:1) C . METHOD DETAILS Protein puriﬁcation ESCRT - II ( Addgene plasmid # 17633 ) , Vps20 ( Addgene plasmid # 21490 ) , Snf7 ( Addgene plasmid # 21492 ) , Vps2 ( Addgene plasmid # 21494 ) , Vps24 ( kind gift from James Hurley lab , UC Berkeley , USA ) and Vps4 ( Addgene plasmid # 21495 ) were expressed and pu - riﬁed as previously described ( Hierro et al . , 2004 ; Wollert et al . , 2009 ) . In detail , proteins were expressed at 20 (cid:1) C overnight in Rosetta2 ( induction 0 . 5M IPTG ) , before lysis by sonication ( lysis buffer : 20 mM HEPES pH7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton , cOmplete ) and HisTrap puriﬁcation ( elution buffer : 20 mM HEPES pH7 . 4 , 100mM NaCl , 100 mM Imidazole ) . MBP - His - tag was cleaved off using TEV followed by puriﬁcation on a Superdex 200 26 / 60 column ( buffer : 20mM HEPES pH 8 . 0 ) . Did2 and Ist1 ( gift from David Katzmann lab , Mayo clinic , USA ) were expressed and puriﬁed as previously described ( Tan et al . , 2015 ) . In detail , proteins were expressed at 30 (cid:1) C overnight in Rosetta2 ( induction 0 . 5M IPTG ) , before lysis by sonication ( lysis buffer : 50mM Tris pH8 . 5 , 5mM b - Mercaptoethanol , 1 % Triton , cOmplete ) . The proteins were puriﬁed using a HisTrap ( elution buffer : 50mM Tris pH8 . 5 , 5mM b - Mercaptoethanol , 1M Imidazole ) followed by dialyses ( buffer : 50mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 150mM NaCl , 2mM DTT ) to re - move the Imidazole . Following the labeling procedure given by the reagent provider , Snf7 , Vps2 , Ist1 and Vps24 were labeled with TFP - AlexaFluor - 488 ( Ref N (cid:1) A - 30005 , ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc , ) . Vps2 and Vp24 were labeled with TFP - Atto - 565 ( Atto - Tec AD 565 - 3 ) . Did2 and Ist1 were labeled with maleimide - Atto - 565 ( Atto - Tec AD 565 - 3 ) . Did2 was labeled with maleimide - AlexFluor - 488 ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc , A - 30005 ) . If not otherwise mentioned , following protein concentration were used : ESCRT - II 1 m M , Vps20 1 m M , Snf7 500nM , Did2 1 m M , Ist1 1 m M , Vps4 1 m M , ATP 2 mM . In Figure S6E 100nM Vps2 and Vps24 were used . In experiments including Did2 Vps2 and Vps24 concentration were scaled up to 1 m M to match Did2 concentration . In general , labeled proteins were mixed 1 : 1 with unlabeled protein . Preparation of giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUV ) and large giant unilamellar vesicles ( LUV ) GUVs were prepared by electroformation : 20 - 30 m L of a 2mg / ml lipid solution in chloroform ( DOPC : DOPS : DOPE - Atto647N : DSPE - PEG ( 2000 ) Biotin , 6 : 4 : 0 . 01 : 0 . 003 ; Avanti Polar Lipids , Atto - tec ) were dried on indium - tin oxide ( ITO ) - coated glass slides for 1h . A growth chamber was assembled by clamping a rubber ring between the ITO - slides , ﬁlled with 500 m L of a sucrose buffer osmotically equilibrated with the experimental buffer . ITO - Slides were then connected to an AC generator set under 1V AC ( 10 Hz ) for 1 . 5h . GUVs were stored at 4 (cid:1) C for at maximum a week . For LUV preparation , DOPC : DOPS : Rhodamine - PE ( 6 : 4 : 1 ; 10 mg / ml ) mixture was evaporated in a glass tube , 500 m L of buffer were added , the tube was vortex followed by 5 times freezing and thawing . LUVs were stored at (cid:3) 20 (cid:1) C until usage . Supported membrane bilayer assay Supported membrane bilayer assay was performed as described in Chiaruttini et al . ( 2015 ) . Experiments were performed in 20 mM Tris pH . 6 . 8 , 200 mM NaCl and 1 mM MgCl 2 . 2 mM DTT was added to the buffer for experiments including Ist1 . GUVs diluted in buffer ll OPEN ACCESS e3 Cell 182 , 1140 – 1155 . e1 – e7 , September 3 , 2020 Article were burst on a plasma - cleaned coverslip forming the bottom of a ﬂow chamber ( coverslip and sticky - Slide VI 0 . 4 , Ibidi ) to form sup - ported bilayers . Thereafter , the chamber was passivated with Casein ( 1mg / ml Sigma - Aldrich ) for 10 min and washed with buffer , before the experiments was conducted . Subsequent changes of protein or buffer solutions in the chamber were made via a syringe pump connected to the ﬂow chamber . For comparison of the binding and disassembly kinetics of subunits ( Figures 1C and 3A ) , two subunits out of the complete mix ( ( Snf7 , ) Vps2 , Vps24 , Did2 , Ist1 ) were added as their labeled version ( either Alexa488 - or Atto565 - ) to unlabeled pre - grown Snf7 - patches and their ﬂuorescence was measured overtime . Then , the obtained single graphs were aligned using the time point of pro - tein - or Vps4 - addition , respectively . Artiﬁcial membrane necks assay For artiﬁcial membrane necks , partially adhered vesicles were prepared as described in Chiaruttini et al . ( 2015 ) . Brieﬂy , a ﬂow cham - ber assembled from a coverslip and sticky - Slide VI 0 . 4 , Ibidi was incubated with Avidin ( 0 . 1 mg / ml ) for 10 min , before washing with buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH . 6 . 8 , 200 mM NaCl and 1mM MgCl 2 ) and addition of GUVs ( including 0 . 03 % DSPE - PEG ( 2000 ) Biotin ) diluted in buffer . As soon as GUVs started to attach biotinylated - Albumin ( 1mg / ml , Sigma - Aldrich ) was added to stop attachment and prevent bursting of the GUVs . After 15 min of incubation , the chamber was washed with 3 chamber volumes of buffer and glass beads diluted in buffer were added ( 1 m m beads , 1 : 500 ; 2 m m beads , 1 : 200 ; Bangs Laboratories ) , which were nearly completely engulfed into attached GUV due to the adhesive forces between glass and lipids . For artiﬁcial necks preparation for EM , LUVs , formed in 500 mOsm sucrose , were diluted 1 : 100 in buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH . 6 . 8 , 200 mM NaCl and 1mM MgCl 2 ) , spun down ( 10’ , 5 , 000 g ) and resuspended in buffer containing 27 nm silicated NH 2 - PS beads ( 1 : 10 ) . Mixture was then vortexed for 30 s and incubated for 1h at RT before loading on a 75 % Sucrose cushion in a centrifuge tube , topped with buffer and centrifuged 20’ , 5 , 000 g to separate bead - containing vesicles from excessive beads . The ﬂoating layer containing the Rhodamine - labeled vesicles was carefully harvested , washed , and resuspended in buffer containing 30 % glycerol and processed identical to freeze - fracture samples . Silication of Amine - polystyrene beads 40 . 5 mL isopropanol and 8 mL ddH 2 O were mixed and pH was adjusted to 11 . 3 using ammonia solution . 27 nm NH 2 - PS beads ( Bangs Laboratories ) were sonicated ( 5 min ) , before 200 m L beads and 193 m L Tetraethylorthosilicat ( TEOS ) were added to the iso - propanol / water mixture under stir . After incubation for 1h , beads were spun down 15’ 13 , 000 g , washed twice with water and ﬁnally resuspended in 0 . 5 mL buffer . Beads were stored at 4 (cid:1) C until usage . Image acquisition Confocal Imaging was performed on an inverted spinning disc microscope assembled by 3i ( Intelligent Imaging Innovation ) consist - ing of a Nikon base ( Eclipse C1 , Nikon ) , a 100x 1 . 49 NA oil immersion objective and an EVOLVE EM - CCD camera ( Ropper Scientiﬁc Inc . ) . For analysis of supported bilayer experiments , 3 m m thick Z stack were maximally projected using a Fiji plugin ( Aguet et al . , 2008 ) . X - y drift of the microscopy was corrected using the plugin Turboreg and a custom - written ImageJ macro . For artiﬁcial mem - brane neck experiments , 15 m m thick Z stacks were acquired . Electron microscopy For EM experiments involving Snf7 , LUVs were diluted 1 : 100 in buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH . 6 . 8 , 200 mM NaCl and 1mM MgCl 2 ) , spun down ( 10’ , 5 , 000 g ) , resuspended in 4 . 5 m M Snf7 for 6h ( 4 (cid:1) C ) , before 1 m M Vps2 , 1 m M Vps24 , 2 m M Did2 and 2 m M Ist1 were added overnight at 4 (cid:1) C . In the experiments analyzing the number of strands per ﬁlament ( Figures 1C and S1E ) , in comparison to data from Mierzwa et al . ( 2017 ) , higher concentrations and longer incubation times of Vps2 - Vps24 were used to ensure comparability with the experiments including Vps2 - Did2 , for which high concentration and long incubation were required due to its low afﬁnity for Snf7 . High concentration and long incubation of Vps2 - Vps24 result in increased ﬁlament bundling a phenomena we ( data not shown ) and other using different ESCRT - III ﬁlaments ( Banjade et al . , 2019 ) observed previously . However , the clear prevalence of multi - mer - of - 2 strands per ﬁlament strongly indicates the occurrence of the lateral co - polymerization we described in Mierzwa et al . ( 2017 ) . In experiments with Vps4 , 1 m M Vps4 , 2 mM ATP and 1 mM MgCl 2 were added to the samples the next morning , and incubated at 30 (cid:1) C for 30 min . To stop Vps4 activity , samples were chilled on ice and diluted 1 : 100 in buffer containing 50 mM EDTA . Finally , all samples were spun down 10’ 5 , 000 g and resuspended in buffer ( negative stain EM ) or buffer containing 30 % glycerol ( cryofreeze - fracture ) . Negative stain samples were absorbed onto EM grids and stained with 2 % uranyl acetate for 30 s . Freeze fracture samples were transferred onto sample stamps , ﬂash - frozen and processed using a 060 Freeze - Fracture System ( BAF ) . To grow Vps2 - Did2 ( - Ist1 ) membrane tubes , 50 m l LUVs ( 10mg / ml ) were diluted in buffer , spun 10’ 5 , 000 g and incubated with 6 m M of Vps2 , Did2 and Ist1 for 60h ( 4 (cid:1) C ) . Samples were treated with Vps4 / ATP as follow : 1 m M Vps4 , 2 mM ATP and 1 mM MgCl 2 were either added in solution for 30 min at 30 (cid:1) C to 1 : 5 diluted samples or to 1 : 20 diluted samples absorbed for 5 min onto an EM - grid . ll OPEN ACCESS Cell 182 , 1140 – 1155 . e1 – e7 , September 3 , 2020 e4 Article Depolymerization in solution was stopped as described above . Depolymerization on grids was stopped by blotting and staining . Images were acquired on a Tecnai G2 Sphera ( FEI ) electron microscope . Optical tweezer tube pulling experiment Membrane nanotube pulling experiments were performed on the setup published in Chiaruttini et al . ( 2015 ) allowing simultaneous optical tweezer application , spinning disc confocal and brightﬁeld imaging based on an inverted Nikon eclipse Ti microscope and a 5W 1064nm laser focused through a 100 3 1 . 3 NA oil objective ( ML5 - CW - P - TKS - OTS , Manlight ) . Outward directed membrane nanotubes were pulled with streptavidin beads ( 3 . 05 m m , Spherotec ) from a GUV containing 0 . 01 % DSPE - PEG ( 2000 ) Biotin and aspired in a motorized micropipette ( MP - 285 , Sutter Instrument ) . Proteins were injected using a slightly bigger micropipette con - nected to a pressure control system ( MFCS - VAC (cid:3) 69 mbar , Fluigent ) . 2 m m glass beads internalized into GUVs adhered on the bot - tom of ﬂow chambers ( see artiﬁcial membrane necks protocol ) were pulled inward to form membrane nanotubes by moving the stage relative to the bead trapped in optical tweezers . Proteins were added via a syringe pump connected to the ﬂow chamber . Radius r of outward pulled membrane nanotubes were calculated from the force F and membrane rigidity k ( k = 12 kT ) using the formula r = ( 2 pk ) / F . F was determined following Hook’s law F = k * D x using the bead displacement and the trap stiffness k ( k = 79 pN / nm / W ) . Radii of inward pulled tubes were estimated using mean ﬂuorescence intensity of the tubes and a calibration curve ( Figure S2A ) which was established from outward pulled tubes . By changing the aspiration pressure in the pipette , the tension , and the radius of the tube can be changed . In vitro reconstitution of ESCRT - III sequence To reconstitute the ESCRT - III sequence , Snf7 - patches were pre - grown on membrane bilayers and washed with 3 chamber volumes of buffer . Then , 2 m M Alexa488 - Snf7 , 1 m M Vps24 , 800 nM Vps2 , 1 . 5 m M Did2 , 1 m M Ist1 , 1 . 5 m M Vps4 and 10 mM ATP were added to the pre - grown patches . To ensure maximal activity of the ATPase throughout the reconstitution , we used a higher ATP ( 10 mM ) con - centration than typically found in cells ( 2 mM ) . We did not observe noticeable changes in the kinetics of any protein as compared to experiments done at 2 mM , besides a faster Did2 disassembly in conditions where it disassembled . Atto565 - Vps2 , Atto565 - Vps24 , Alexa488 - Ist1 or Atto565 - Did were mixed 1 : 1 with unlabeled protein . Vps2 , Vps24 , Ist1 and Did2 dynamics were imaged separately , but together with either Alexa488 - Snf7 or Atto565 - Vps2 to provide a time reference . To align the experiments on the time axis a scaling factor was calculated from the ﬂuorescence intensity curve of Snf7 or Vps2 . All experiments were rescaled with this factor proportional to the time of the peak , and the time at which it reached the lower plateau value after depolymerization and the distance between these time points ( Figure S2A ) . Vps24 , Vps2 and Did2 graphs were aligned using the calculated scaling factor from Snf7 . Ist1 graph was aligned using the calculated scaling factor from Vps2 ( Figure 4A ) . Biochemical membrane ﬁssion assay Membrane ﬁssion assay was adapted from Boucrot et al . ( 2012 ) . Brieﬂy , Vps2 - Did2 ( - Ist1 ) membrane tubes were grown as described above . After incubation with Vps4 and ATP , liposomes were spun 15’ at 250 . 000 g , 4 (cid:1) C , supernatant and pellet were mixed with sam - ple buffer and separated using SDS - PAGE at 4 (cid:1) C . Gels were stained with 0 . 1 % Coomassie in 10 % acetic acid and destained in ddH 2 O . Bands were quantiﬁed using ImageJ ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . Membrane neck ﬁssion assay Artiﬁcial membrane necks generated by 1 m m beads were incubated ﬁrst with ESCRT - II , Vps20 and Snf7 for 5 0 , followed by 15’ incubation with Vps2 , Vps24 , Did2 , Ist1 , Vps4 and ATP , before the protein - mixture was replaced by buffer . Beads were pulled toward the center of the GUV with an optical trap and then released . Beads connected to the membrane of the GUV instantly retracted after release , in contrast to unconnected beads which stay in the center of the GUV . Kinetics of CHMP4B and IST1 endosomal relocalization after hypertonic shock For live - cell imaging , HeLa Kyoto cells stably expressing LAT - CHMP4B - GFP or LAT - IST1 - mcherry were seeded at 1 to 1 ratio into 35mm MatTek glass bottom microwell dishes ( MatTek Corporation ) . Before imaging , cells were rinsed 2 - fold with 1ml Leibovitz’s live imaging medium ( Life Technologies , Thermoﬁsher ) so that cells could be incubated without CO2 equilibration at room temperature . Cells were imaged using a 100x 1 . 4 NA oil DIC Plan - Apochromat VC objective ( Nikon ) with a Nikon A1 scanning confocal microscope at speed of 1 frame every 2 minutes . Hypertonic shock was done by addition of 0 . 5M sucrose containing Leibovitz’s medium for a ﬁnal osmolarity of 900 mOsm . Formation of protein polymers on bicelles We prepared micelles by solubilizing a dried lipid ﬁlm made from DOPC / DOPS ( 60 / 40 mol / mol ) at 25 (cid:1) C in 100 mM NaCl , 20 mM HEPES pH = 7 . 5 , 20 mM CHAPS ( 3 - [ ( 3 - Cholamidopropyl ) - dimethyl - ammonio ] - 1 - propanesulfonate hydrate , Sigma - Aldrich ) at a total lipid concentration of 12 mM . The following protocol is adapted from Szwedziak et al . ( 2014 ) . In brief , micelles were homogenized by bath sonication and stirring at 25 (cid:1) C for 1 h before addition of 4 m M Snf7 , 2 m M Vps24 and 2 m M Vps2 , making sure that the detergent ll OPEN ACCESS e5 Cell 182 , 1140 – 1155 . e1 – e7 , September 3 , 2020 Article concentration was above its critical micellar concentration after addition of all proteins . The sample was then gradually diluted four - fold over 30 min under agitation at 25 (cid:1) C and further incubated for 5 h . For cryo - EM , 4 m L of the sample were deposited on glow - discharged Quantifoil R1 . 2 / 1 . 3 300 mesh copper grids and plunge frozen in liquid ethane after a two - sided blot using a FEI Vitrobot . Vitriﬁed helical tubes were imaged in low - dose mode on a FEI Tecnai G2 Sphera LaB 6 at 200 kV using a 4k x 4k FEI Eagle Camera . RELION 2 . 0 . 4 was used for 2D classiﬁcation of manually selected helical segments . Molecular dynamics simulation The ﬁlament subunits were represented by the 3 - beaded model , as previously developed by us ( Harker - Kirschneck et al . , 2019 ) . The target geometry of the protein ﬁlaments was a ring , which was controlled by the 9 bonds between consecutive ﬁlament subunits . By setting the equilibrium bond lengths to different values , the ﬁrst ﬁlament was targeted as a ﬂat ring ( t 1 = 0 , Figure S4B ) and the second ﬁlament a tilted ring ( t 2 = 90 , Figure S4B ) . The tilt angle t is deﬁned as the angle between the radial axis and the triplet subunit axis ( see Figure 2a in Harker - Kirschneck et al . , 2019 ) . Force constants for the bonds between ﬁlament subunits were set as k 1 = k 2 = 48 $ k B T = nm 2 ( Figure 5C ) or k 1 = 24 $ k B T = nm 2 ; k 2 = 48 $ k B T = nm 2 ( Figure S4A ) . The central angle between neighboring ﬁlament subunits was set as a 0 = 15 + , so that the target radius R equals 13 . 2 ( 15 . 8 ) nm for the ﬁrst ( second ) ﬁlament . R is deﬁned as the in - plane distance between the cen - ter of the ring to the center of mass of each subunit . Lennard - Jones ( LJ ) potential ( r c = 1 : 3 $ r min , ε 1 = ε 2 = 3 : 0 k B T ( Figures 5C and S4A , left panel ) , ε 1 = 2 : 0 k B T , ε 2 = 4 : 0 k B T ( Figure S4A , right panel ) ) was applied to mimic the binding interfaces between the two bottom beads of each ﬁlament subunit ( light green , light purple ) and all membrane beads ( gray ) , as well as the bottom beads at the interface of the two ﬁlaments . Volume exclusion potential ( ε = 2 : 0 k B T , r c = r min ) was applied to all other pairs of protein beads . ε is the depth of the LJ potential , k B is the Boltzmann constant , T is the temperature , r c is the LJ cut off distance , r min is the distance at the potential minimum . The membrane was represented by the one - bead - thick model in the ﬂuid state ( Yuan et al . , 2010 ) with parameters ε = 4 : 34 k B T , m = 3 : 0 , x = 4 : 0 , q 0 = 0 + following the notation in the original paper . For the simulation of the disassembly of the second ﬁla - ment , we manually set all bonded and non - bonded interactions of this ﬁlament within itself and with other part of the system to zero . All beads were in the same size ( diameter d = 2 : 3 nm ) . The ﬁlaments were initialized as a set of loosely - packed double - stranded spiral in the ﬂat state , with each ﬁlament constructed of 186 subunits . The individual ﬁlament subunits were set as rigid bodies . A layer of 7360 membrane beads ( 184 3 184 nm 2 ) were laid under the ﬁlaments in the x - y plane ( see Figures S4C – S4E ) . Periodic boundary condition was applied to all directions . The box size in z direction was set to 2300 nm to avoid the periodic boundary effect in this direction . Time step was set as 0 . 01 t 0 , where t 0 is the reduced time unit . The simulation was performed in the NPH ensemble with the barostat targeted at zero pressure to model a mem - brane with a low tension ( Harker - Kirschneck et al . , 2019 ) . The Langevin thermostat was applied at each time step to model Brownian diffusion at the room temperature . Initially , the membrane was equilibrated for 10 , 000 steps with the protein ﬁlaments kept frozen . The protein ﬁlaments were then released with both ﬁlaments targeted at t = 0 . We then changed the target geometry of the second ﬁlament to the t 2 = 90 state , while made no change to the t 1 = 0 ﬁlament . Finally , the t 1 = 0 ﬁlament was disassembled and only the t 2 = 90 was kept on the membrane . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SBL - bilayer assay and membrane necks For quantiﬁcation of supported bilayer experiments , integrated ﬂuorescence intensity of single patches was measured , normalized to either their maximum or time point 0 and a kymograph was extracted . For artiﬁcial membrane neck experiments , sections containing membrane necks were selected manually , linearized and integrated ﬂuorescence intensity was measured along the contour and / or through time using Fiji . Fluorescence intensities were normalized by their maximum value . To determine the colocalization of Alexa488 - Snf7 and Atto647N - DOPE peaks , relative ﬂuorescence was measured along linearized membrane contours after smooth averaging , relative ﬂuorescence values were binarized ( 1 above threshold , 0 below , thresholds : 0 . 3 Snf7 , 0 . 4 DOPE ) . The percentage of no colocalization was extracted by the proportion of pixels with the value 1 from the Snf7 channel for which the value in the mem - brane channel was 0 . No colocalization was only counted at a minimal distance of four pixels to the nearest membrane neck ( value 1 ) . For all experiments the mean and standard deviation ( SD ) were calculated . Number of independent experiments ( n ) und number of patches or membrane necks ( ROI ) analyzed are indicated in the corresponding ﬁgure legends . The graph and statistics were done using Prism 8 ( GraphPad software ) . Cryo electron microscopy RELION 2 . 0 . 4 was used for 2D classiﬁcation of manually selected helical segments . Confocal imaging of mammalian cells For the analysis , the spots were detected for each frame for both channels using the spot detector plugin in Icy software and exported as ROIs . For each time point the sum of dots mean intensity was calculated using Excel , the value obtained before the shock was ll OPEN ACCESS Cell 182 , 1140 – 1155 . e1 – e7 , September 3 , 2020 e6 Article subtracted and the curve was normalized to 1 ( for its maximum value ) . The graph and statistics were done using Prism 8 ( GraphPad software ) . Mean and standard error of the mean ( SEM ) were calculated . Number of independent experiments ( n ) und number of spots ( ROI ) used in the analysis are indicated in the ﬁgure legend . Molecular dynamics simulation The duration of the last three production runs were (cid:4) 1 , 000 , 000 steps each . The molecular dynamics simulations were carried out with Lammps code ( https : / / lammps . sandia . gov ) ( Plimpton , 1995 ) . The invagination depth was calculated by taking the z coordinate difference in the average of highest 5000 and the average of lowest 5 membrane particles . ll OPEN ACCESS e7 Cell 182 , 1140 – 1155 . e1 – e7 , September 3 , 2020 Article Supplemental Figures Figure S1 .
