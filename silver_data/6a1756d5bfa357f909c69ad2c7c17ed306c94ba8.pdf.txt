The International Journal of Accounting and Business Society Vol . 22 , No . 1 August 2014 © Centre for Indonesian Accounting and Management Research Postgraduate Program , BrawijayaUniversity 113 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP CREATIVE BEHAVIORS Kunio Ikari School of Business Administration , Kobe University Japan Abstract The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between individual and group creative behaviors . Creativity is defined as the interaction among aptitude , process , and environment by which an individual or a group produces a perceptible product that is both novel and useful ( Plucker et al . 2004 ) . Group creativity are performed via brainstorming and group meetings ( Reiter - Palmon et al . , 2012 ) . Data was collected from 108 Indonesian college students . Individual creative behaviors were measured via the activity checklist developed by Runco et al . ( 2001 ) . Group creative behaviors were evaluated by the self - reported scale that clearly reflected the process to generate ideas in group activities . Factor analysis found five factor solutions for group creative behaviors . Linear regression analysis found that Runco’s individual creative behaviors exerted the significant influences on four out of five group creative factors , i . e . , collaborative , originality , ingenious , and self - confidence . Theoretical and practical implications are considered . Key Words : Individual Creative Behavior , Group Creative Behavior INTRODUCTION In recent years , most of activities are operated in organizations . Organizations provide products and services that are novel and useful . However , past studies put considerable focuses on individual processes that develop creative products ( Puccio and Cabra , 2012 ) . For example , cognitive process , creative thinking , and creative behavior are heavily studied . Regarding the organizational level , researchers investigate the planning process to generate creative products under the name of “innovation” ( Hunter , Cassidy , and Ligon , 2012 ) . Practically , organizations produce creative products through the group activities rather than individual works ( Paulus , Dzindolet , and Kohn , 2012 ) . A lot of project teams are composed in Google , IDEO , and Nintendo to develop new products . However , few studies uncover to what degree 114The Relationship Between Individual and , . . . . Vol . 22 , No . 1 August 2014 © Centre for Indonesian Accounting and Management Research Postgraduate Program , BrawijayaUniversity group processes are effective ( Palmon , Wigert , and Vreede , 2012 ) . This study aims to explore the process to generate creative products via group activities . Hocevar ( 1981 ) argued that past behaviors are one of the most effective predictors of creative outcomes . The behavioral approach focuses on behaviors and activities that ordinary people , not genius and incredible person , take to produce creative products ( Runco , Plucker , and Lim , 2001 ) . For example , the behavioral approach involves an activity that a sales clerk in the book store used to make unique point - of - purchase advertisings ( POP ads ) . Assessments of behaviors are usually used as self - reported scales ( Kaufman , Plucker , Baer , 2008 ) . However , the behavioral approach has the depending on a specific situation . Past studies tend to focus on educational setting ( Kaufman , Plucker , and Baer , 2008 ) . Researches on educational setting specified the two dimensional model : artistic and scientific ( Carson et al . 2005 ; Dollinger , Burke , and Gump , 2007 ; Hocevar , 1979 ; Ivcevic and Mayer , 2007 ) . However , the two dimensional model doesn’t fit organizational setting . In organizational setting , creativity defined as ideas that are novel and useful ( Mumford , Hester , and Robledo , 2012 ) . Because the ideas , such as new concepts of automobiles and planning surprise events in the hotel , are likely to contribute to the organization ( Acar and Runco , 2012 ) . Walczyk , Runco , Tripp , and Smith ( 2008 ) argued that the ideational behavior is the effective indicator to evaluate people who have a tendency to generate ideas well . In order to assess behaviors to generate ideas , Runco et al . ( 2001 ) developed the Runco Ideational Behavioral Scale ( RIBS ) . The scale measures ideational behaviours that reflect underlying potentials and talents to generate ideas ( Plucker and Makel , 2010 ) . Runco et al . ( 2001 ) designed the RIBS to target ordinary people who generate original and unique ideas in everyday life . However , the RIB Sevaluates ideational behaviors in individual works only , excluding ideational behaviors in group works . According to Reiter - Palmon , Herman , and Yammarino ( 2008 ) , the idea generation in groups are facilitated by the brainstorming and group meeting . The brainstorming is the most basic and effective technique of the ideas generation ( Baruah and Paulus , 2011 ; Brown and Paulus , 2002 ; Paulus and Yang , 2000 ) . Osborn ( 1957 ) organized the brainstorming based on the Guilford’s ( 1971 ) structure of intelligence ( SOI ) model . The SOI model explains that creative productions are produced by the combination with divergent and convergent thinking . Divergent thinking leads to four characteristics of ideas : quantity of ideas ( fluency ) , variety of ideas ( flexibility ) , quality of ideas ( Elaboration ) and uniqueness of ideas ( originality ) . Convergent thinking facilitates feasibility , workability , and persuasion of ideas . Osborn ( 1957 ) argued the brainstorming should be operated via two steps : 1 ) listing ideas ( divergent thinking ) and 2 ) sophisticating ideas ( convergent thinking ) . However , most of studies focus on the Step The International Journal of Accounting and Business Society Vol . 22 , No . 1 August 2014 © Centre for Indonesian Accounting and Management Research Postgraduate Program , BrawijayaUniversity 115 1only ( Reiter - Palmon , Wigert , and Vreede , 2012 ) . Especially , quantity of ideas is treated as creative outcomes ( Brown and Paulus , 2002 ) . Because original and unique ideas correlate with the number of ideas , quantity of ideas is the most important factor of creative outcomes ( Kohn , Paulus , and Choi , 2011 ) . Few studies examine both listing and sophisticating ideas in the brainstorming processes . Therefore it is important to examine both listing and sophisticating process in the group brainstorming . Two research questions are examined . First , this study aims to explore the factor structure of group ideational behaviors . Ideational behavior is one of the most effective predictors of creative outcomes ( Plucker 1998 ; Plucker and Makel , 2010 ) . In recent studies , two popular behavioral scales are existed : the Creative Achievement Questionnaire ( CAQ ; Carson , Peterson , and Higgins , 2005 ) and the Runco Ideational Behavior ( RIBS ; Runco , Plucker , and Lim 2001 ) . However , these two behavioral measurements are focused on behaviors in individual works only , not consider behaviors in group activities . This study assumes that the group ideational behavior is the multi - dimensional . According to Sawyer ( 2010 ) , in order to produce creative outcomes , individuals have to take more diverse roles in group processes than individual works . In this study , the structure of group ideational behaviours was explored in the brainstorming workshops empirically . Second , this study aims to specify the relationship between individual and group ideational behaviors . Because the best scientific explanation of creativity is hybrid , incorporating properties of both individuals and groups ( Sawyer , 2010 ) . This study assumes that the individual creative behavior positively influences on group ideational behaviors via divergent thinking , not influences on group ideational behaviors based on improving persuasions and feasibility of ideas . If the individual creative behaviourhas no relationship with behaviors based on implementability of ideas , groups might consist of not only people who are able to show high individual creativity , but also people who can commit to improve persuasion and feasibility of ideas . This study is the exploratory investigation of the group ideational behaviors . RESEARCH METHOD Data was collected from 108Indonesian university students ( 52 male and 54 female ) in economy and business majors . Five freshmen , 95 sophomore students , and 6 junior students completed the survey in the courses in the faculty of economy and business . The average age is 19 . 47 ( SD = . 73 ) . Individual creative behaviors . The RIBS ( Runco et al . 2001 ) is used as the measurement of individual creative behaviors , the RIBS describes creative behaviors in everyday life that are adaptable to organizational situations . Runco et al . ( 2001 ) provided the uni - dimensionality of the RIBS . The RIBS measures creative behaviors by 23items with 5 point Likert scale rating from 1 ( Never ) to 5 ( Very often ) . 116The Relationship Between Individual and , . . . . Vol . 22 , No . 1 August 2014 © Centre for Indonesian Accounting and Management Research Postgraduate Program , BrawijayaUniversity Group ideational behaviors . The group ideational behavior was measured by the original items in this study . The conceptual framework was derived from the discussion with two faculties and eight graduate students . By the close look at the actual brainstorming workshops , group ideational behaviors are differentiated into three constructs : flexibility of ideation , fluency of ideation , and storytelling . Flexibility of ideation means the degree to which the person makes open ideation and avoid stereotype in brainstorming . Fluency of ideation is based on Guilford’s ( 1967 ) four factors , i . e . fluency ( quantity of ideas ) , flexibility ( variety of ideas ) , originality , and elaboration ( quality of ideas ) . Fluency describes the behavior that stimulates the discussion and generates more ideas . Storytelling is the behavior that makes idea understood easily and improves the persuasion by making the plot and visual aids . In addition , levels of creative thinking and creative magnitude are measured . Levels of creative thinking and creative magnitude depend on the four C model of creativity ( Kaufman and Beghetto , 2009 ) : little C , big C , mini C , and pro C . Little C is described as everyday creativity which can be found in nearly all people . Big C means the eminent creativity which is the genius ideation and being able to find in the gifted innovator . Mini C is presented as creativity inherent in the learning process . Pro C is defined as the developmental and effortful progression beyond little C that represents professional level expertise in any creative areas . All items were described actual behaviors to perform creative ideation . 35 items , rating from 1 ( Never ) to 5 ( Very often ) were designed under the assumption of having the multi - dimensional structure divided into the ideational process and improving persuasion . FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION In order to examine the structure of group ideational behaviors , the exploratory factor analysis was used . The exploratory factor analyses were conducted by the maximum likelihood estimation with the promax rotation with the Kaiser normalization . Five factors eigen values were extracted of sizes looking at 7 . 27 , 1 . 77 , 1 . 44 , 1 . 14 , and 1 . 00 , accountingfor 25 . 08 % , 6 . 12 % , 4 . 96 % , 3 . 95 % , and 3 . 45 % of the total variance , respectively . Six items were eliminated because they didn’t have high loadings on five factors . Item loadings and eigen values of five factor solution were appeared in Table 1 . Factor 1 was interpreted as collaborative that was behaviors that stimulate discussions to generate ideas . Factor 2 was named as originality that was behaviors that showed originality in group discussions . Factor 3 was organized as storytelling that was behaviors that made the plot and storyline to present ideas . Factor 4was identified as ingenious that was behaviors that developed quality of ideas in group discussions . Factor 5 was categorized as self - confidence that was behaviours based on confidence own potentials and talents to generate ideas . The calculation of Cronbach’s alpha for overall group ideational behaviors produced an estimate ( . 86 ) .

First , this study explored the factor structure of group ideational behaviors . Second , this study explored the relationship between individual and group ideational behaviors . Regarding the first research question , the factor structure of group ideational behaviors was explored via factor analyses . The result of factor analyses found that the structure of group ideational behaviors had more complexity than the individual ideational behaviors . Although the individual ideational behaviors were found to be one factor ( Runco The International Journal of Accounting and Business Society Vol . 22 , No . 1 August 2014 © Centre for Indonesian Accounting and Management Research Postgraduate Program , BrawijayaUniversity 119 et al . 2001 ) , this study found the five factor solution of group creative behaviors : collaborative , originality , storytelling , ingenious , and self - confidence . Collaborative is defined as behaviors to commit and facilitate the discussion to generate ideas . Originality is interpreted as competencies to produce original and unique ideas . Storytelling described behaviors to improve persuasions of ideas in presentations . Ingenious was similar to originality , but more practical than originality . Ingenious was defined as activities to add more originality to ideas . Self - confidence consisted of the confidence in quality of own ideas . These five factors could be interpreted by brainstorming theories . Osborn ( 1957 ) argued that the brainstorming consisted of two dimensions : generating ideas and brushing up ideas . In order to generate quantity of ideas , group members are required taking on collaborative behaviors , originality , and self - confidence of own ideas . On the other hand , storytelling and ingenious ideations are useful for brushing up ideas . In summary of the implication about the first research question , the factor structure of group ideational behaviors was interpreted as two dimensions : 1 ) three factors ( collaborative , originality , and self - confidence ) were behaviors that stimulate quantity of ideas , and 2 ) two factors ( storytelling and ingenious ) were behaviours that sophisticate ideas . Regarding the second research question , this study found that the individual ideational behaviors significantly influenced on most of group ideational behaviors . The individual ideational behaviors positively were correlated with group ideational behaviors that improve quantity and quality of ideas . In contrast , the individual ideational behaviors were not related to storytelling . Storytelling is the behaviors to improve persuasions of ideas . In other words , people who have competencies to generate ideas in individual works take effective behaviors to generate ideas in groups . However , the individual ideational behavior does not influence on improving persuasions to present ideas . This study implies the practical benefits that organizations have to recognize the differentiation of ideation skills and presentation skills . In many organizations , ideational skills are sometimes confused with presentation skills . Presentation skills increase feasibility and persuasiveness of ideas by making prototypes , sketching and roughing ideas , and describing the plot and storylines ( Puccio and Cabra , 2012 ) . In order to produce creative outputs , both ideational skills and presentation skills need to be combined . It is desirable that groups have to be composed of diverse members ; person who can produce unique ideas , clever people who have critical thinking , and the storyteller who has good technique to present ideas . One of the biggest limitations of this study was the process of data collection . The present study collected data from university students only . Therefore , results need to be replicated with more diverse samples before they can be generalized confidently . Additionally , the 120The Relationship Between Individual and , . . . . Vol . 22 , No . 1 August 2014 © Centre for Indonesian Accounting and Management Research Postgraduate Program , BrawijayaUniversity present sample size was modest . Larger samples will provide greater findings than occurred herein in future researches . Future research is expected to develop the five factor model of group ideational behaviors more elaborately . The group ideational behavior receives influences from environments and group situations , e . g . organizational contexts , creative leadership , diversity of groups , and personality of group members . In order to confirm the validity , future researchis expected to specify the relationship between group ideational behaviors and creative outcomes . REFERENCES Acar S . and Runco M . A .
