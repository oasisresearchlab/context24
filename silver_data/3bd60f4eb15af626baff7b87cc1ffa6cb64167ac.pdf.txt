AnAlysis nAture methods | VOL . 14 NO . 7 | JULY 2017 | 673 Chromosome conformation capture ( 3C ) and fluorescence in situ hybridization ( Fish ) are two widely used technologies that provide distinct readouts of 3d chromosome organization . While both technologies can assay locus - specific organization , how to integrate views from 3C , or genome - wide hi - C , and Fish is far from solved . Contact frequency , measured by hi - C , and spatial distance , measured by Fish , are often assumed to quantify the same phenomena and used interchangeably . here , however , we demonstrate that contact frequency is distinct from average spatial distance , both in polymer simulations and in experimental data . Performing a systematic analysis of the technologies , we show that this distinction can create a seemingly paradoxical relationship between 3C and Fish , both in minimal polymer models with dynamic looping interactions and in loop - extrusion simulations . together , our results indicate that cross - validation of hi - C and Fish should be carefully designed , and that jointly considering contact frequency and spatial distance is crucial for fully understanding chromosome organization . While genomes are often considered as one - dimensional sequences , they are also physically organized in three dimensions inside the cell nucleus , with far - reaching consequences 1 – 4 . One of the many important implications relates to gene regulation : regions of regulatory DNA are often very far away in the linear genomic sequence from the genes they regulate , yet their regula - tory interactions are presumed to rely on direct encounters in three - dimensional space . Current methods provide indirect , yet complementary , readouts of the high - resolution chromosomal dynamics underlying these processes . Below we focus on two widely used techniques for assaying chromosomes , DNA - FISH and chromosome conformation capture ( 3C ) . 3C techniques have become popular for their high - throughput ability to connect spatial information to the genomic sequence 2 – 5 . 3C - based approaches use crosslinking and ligation to capture the information that two genomic loci are spatially proximal . Moreover , 3C techniques are readily generalized to the genome - wide scale , and are then usually termed Hi - C 6 ; here we refer to the contact frequency obtained from Hi - C and 3C interchangeably . Importantly , while 3C records whether two loci were in contact in some fraction of cells in the population , it does not record where in the nucleus this contact occurred . Also , 3C is usually performed on large populations of cells . This is advantageous in that 3C can assay both very frequent and very rare events , as the large population allows a large dynamic range . However , informa - tion regarding cell - to - cell variability is not available in popula - tion - average maps of chromosomal contact frequencies 7 , 8 . FISH technologies are appreciated for their ability to specifi - cally determine the spatial position of sets of chromosomal loci by imaging 9 . FISH is based on optically labeled probes that hybridize to complementary regions of chromosomes . Importantly , as an imaging - based approach , FISH is intrinsically able to probe cell - to - cell variability and directly record spatial position inside the nucleus . Many different labeling approaches have been consid - ered , including labeling pairs of loci ( two - locus FISH ) 10 as well as labeling larger contiguous regions 11 and even whole - chromosome painting 12 – 14 . High - throughput 15 , 16 and super - resolution 17 – 19 FISH approaches are currently in development . Still , obtaining high - resolution pairwise distance distributions for all pairs of loci—that is , constructing a pairwise distance map similar to a genome - wide Hi - C contact map—currently remains out of reach . For further experimental background on the connection between FISH and Hi - C , see ref . 20 . In studies that rely primarily on 3C - based approaches , FISH is often performed on a subset of loci as a means of validation . Typically , for loci at increasing genomic separations , their aver - age FISH spatial distance increases and 3C contact frequency decreases 6 , 21 – 23 . Additionally , for a limited set of tested pairs of loci , it was found that loci in the same A / B compartment contact each other more frequently and are on average closer 6 ; similar findings are obtained for loci in the same topologically associat - ing domain ( TAD ) 24 , 25 . Moreover , spatial distance and contact frequency are largely correlated at the ~ 300 kb – 10 Mb scale 26 . However , this does not seem to be strictly the case for all loci 8 , and such assessments can even lead to seemingly paradoxical observa - tions when comparing FISH and 3C 20 , 27 . Because of the stochastic and variable nature of chromosome folding in vivo , polymer models provide a useful framework Fish - ing for captured contacts : towards reconciling Fish and 3C Geoffrey Fudenberg 1 , 2 & Maxim Imakaev 1 1 Center for the 3D Structure and Physics of the Genome , and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science ( IMES ) , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , Massachusetts , USA . 2 Current address : Gladstone Institutes , University of California , San Francisco , California , USA .

Modeling efforts naturally started with homopolymer models , which assume the chemi - cal equivalence of all monomers ( i . e . , that there is no sequence specificity for chromosomal interactions or folding 28 ) . While chromosomes in vivo are generally better described by models that include locus - specific folding 8 , 28 , homopolymer models are highly studied in the physics literature and are often more amena - ble to analytical understanding . In the majority of homopolymer models , the further apart two monomers are along the polymer chain , the further apart they are in space , and the less frequently they are in contact ; this leads to an often - useful , but potentially misleading , heuristic that the two quantities are directly related ( Supplementary Note ) . As measuring contact frequency was largely unachievable in polymer systems prior to the develop - ment of 3C for chromosomes , the concordance or discordance of contact frequency and spatial distance has received relatively little attention in the polymer physics literature . Here we demonstrate how 3C and FISH generally probe differ - ent aspects of spatial chromosome organization . We first illustrate how spatial distance and contact frequency can display a seem - ingly paradoxical relationship in currently available experimental data , focusing on the simplest two - locus labeling approach for FISH , as it is most directly comparable to 3C . We then study the connection between contact frequency and average spatial dis - tance in a simple polymer model ; these simulations show that a minimal assumption , introduction of a single dynamic loop between two loci , can break the typical relationship between con - tact frequency and average spatial distance . We then consider pol - ymer simulations with loop extrusion , and find that this process can also affect contact frequency and spatial distances to greatly different degrees . Together our results show how seemingly para - doxical relationships between contact frequency and spatial dis - tance can easily emerge in experimental data for physical reasons , demonstrate that cross - validation of Hi - C and FISH must be very carefully considered , and argue that joint consideration of contact frequency and spatial distance will underlie further understand - ing of chromosome organization in vivo . results3C and Fish probe different aspects of spatial organization To investigate the connection between 3C and FISH , we focused on the simplest case of both methods , in which each method probes the relationship between a pair of loci ( Fig . 1a , b ) . A com - mon design for FISH experiments involves labeling a pair of genomic loci to directly visualize their distances in a population of cells ( Fig . 1a ) . This experimental design allows the measure - ment of the probability density function ( PDF ) of spatial distances between a pair of loci ( Fig . 1c ) . Results from such experiments are often shown as cumulative distribution functions ( CDFs , Fig . 1d ) as these do not require binning or density - estimation steps to obtain relatively smooth curves for limited numbers of cells . In contrast with FISH , 3C experiments capture rare contacts that occur when the loci are closer than the capture radius imposed by crosslinking and ligation ( Fig . 1b ) . Roughly , 3C measures the inte - gral of the spatial distance PDF up to the capture radius ( Fig . 1c ) , or , equivalently , the value of the CDF at the capture radius ( Fig . 1d ) 20 . Since such small distances are relatively rare , imaging many cells is certainly a requirement for directly comparing 3C contact probabilities with distances measured by FISH . We further examined the connection between 3C and FISH by considering recent publicly available Hi - C data 23 . The authors of this publication performed high - resolution Hi - C experiments and reported several thousands of CTCF - mediated peaks , termed loops , in the Hi - C data . As a validation of the loops by FISH , they report CDF FISH plots for four pairs of ‘loop’ and ‘control’ loci at matched genomic separations ( for example , peak1 – loop and peak1 – control , re - plotted in Supplementary Fig . 1 ) for the same cell type . As part of the validation , the authors reported that for each of the loop – control pairs of loci , the median spatial distance changed concordantly with the Hi - C signal 23 . While this holds , we also found that this was not always the case when we compared loops and controls from different pairs . Indeed , we found a seem - ingly paradoxical relationship between peak4 – loop and peak3 – control ( Fig . 2 ) : peak4 – loop has higher contact frequency despite being further away on average than peak3 – control . Nevertheless , the change in the value of the CDF at small distances actually was in agreement with measurements from Hi - C , suggesting that this short - range behavior of the CDF is more closely connected with contact frequency 21 . A similar situation is observed for peak4 – loop and peak2 – control . In contrast , for all control – control pairs of loci , the median spatial distance changed concordantly with the Hi - C signal . We note that seemingly paradoxical pairs involved comparisons between a loop and a control . Together , these observations suggest that locus - specific chro - mosome organization in vivo can be an important reason why average spatial distance and contact frequency could behave diver - gently . They additionally argue that to reconcile this divergence and cross - validate observations from 3C , it will be necessary to obtain the full spatial distance distribution from FISH , includ - ing very short distances .

Following past work in which we investigated the effect of a fixed chromatin loop 29 , we modeled chromatin as a semi - flexible polymer fiber with excluded volume interactions ( Online Methods , Supplementary Note ) . We per - formed simulations using OpenMM 30 , 31 , and calculated simulated contact maps ( Fig . 3a ) , spatial distance distributions ( Fig . 3b , c ) , and average spatial distance maps ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) from the simulated ensemble of conformations . We imposed the dynamic looping interaction using a short - ranged attractive force . Monomers at the base of the 25 - kb dynamic loop interacted with attractive energy ( 4 kT unless noted ) when they were closer than a distance of 2 monomer diameters ; for other monomers the attractive part of the potential was set to be negligibly small ( 0 . 1 kT ) . This pairwise interaction poten - tial could arise from direct molecular interactions , and the two monomers involved in the dynamic looping interaction can be thought of as hard spheres that stick to some degree upon coming into contact , following a stochastic encounter in 3D ( reviewed in refs . 8 , 32 ) . In our simulations , the dynamic looping interac - tion is clearly visible in the contact frequency map , but is faint in a map of average spatial distances ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) . Interestingly , the PDF of spatial distances for monomers at the base of the dynamic loop and control monomers ( Fig . 3b ) appeared quite similar , apart from a sharp peak at short distances for the monomers at the loop base . For typically considered polymer systems of indistinguish - able monomers , mean spatial distance and contact probability are generally inversely related ( Supplementary Note ) . However , our simulations demonstrate that even a minimal modification , introduction of a single dynamic loop , changes this typical behav - ior ( Fig . 4 ) . While a comparison between control loci of separa - tion 15 kb or 25 kb displays the typical monotonic behavior over all genomic separations ( Fig . 4b ) , an apparent paradox emerges when comparing the control loci separated by 15 kb with the 25 - kb dynamic loop ( Fig . 4c ) . While the 25 - kb dynamic loop is further apart on average , it displays a higher contact frequency . This behavior can emerge because contacts are rare events , and therefore contact frequency can increase many - fold without large changes in the average distance ( Supplementary Fig . 2d , f ) . Similar behavior emerges in simulations for a range of param - eter values of chromatin stiffness , chromatin density , dynamic loop attraction strength , and loop size ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Consideration of dynamic loop models as equilibrium ensembles of conformations provides further support for the widespread possibility of seemingly paradoxical pairs ( Supplementary Note ) . Together , our simulations show how , even in a particularly simple case , seemingly paradoxical relationships can emerge between spatial distance and contact frequency , arguing for caution when designing comparisons between FISH and 3C . simulations illustrate how experimental limitations could affect validation of a dynamic loop We next investigated how possible experimental limitations to either FISH or 3C can impact our ability to ascertain the presence of this simulated looping interaction . In FISH experiments , assaying a finite number of cells both imposes uncertainty on the PDF and makes the probability of rare events difficult to estimate . Consistently , it is more difficult to reliably detect changes in contact frequency than median spa - tial distance in simulations when assaying a limited number of conformations ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . As contact frequencies are often quite low , this indicates that consistent validations of Hi - C by FISH would require assaying orders - of - magnitude - larger numbers of cells than is typical in FISH experiments . For FISH , additional uncertainty can be imposed by factors including probe size , chromatin movement during denaturation and hybridization , background noise , and ambiguities arising 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 S pa t i a l d i s t 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 P ( < 300 n m ) 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 l og 10 ( H i - C ) 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 Spatial distance ( µ m ) Spatial distance ( µ m ) C u m u l a t i v e p r obab ili t y C u m u l a t i v e p r obab ili t y a b P ea k 3 – c on t r o l P ea k 4 – c on t r o l P ea k 3 – c on t r o l P ea k 4 – l oop 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 Peak3 – control Peak4 – control Peak3 – control Peak4 – loop S pa t i a l d i s t P ( < 300 n m ) l og 10 ( H i - C ) Figure 2 | Experimental data demonstrate the complex relationship between Hi - C and FISH .

In simulations , we considered how the first two factors might affect spatial distance distributions of loop and control loci ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . To simulate the impact of probe size , we considered the pairwise distributions between centroids of cho - sen regions , rather than an exact pair of monomers . To simulate uncertainty or perturbation of relative distances due to chromatin movement during the FISH protocol , we simulated probe localiza - tion uncertainty by adding Gaussian noise to each set of simulated probe distances . We find that even a small uncertainty or impreci - sion in the spatial localization of probes during FISH makes the existence of a dynamic looping interaction much more difficult to ascertain , whereas larger probe size had a relatively smaller impact on the spatial distributions ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . In a 3C experiment , whether two loci in close spatial prox - imity in a given cell are recorded as a contact depends on the effective capture radius . The capture radius can be influenced by a number of factors , including restriction efficiency , restric - tion frequency , and the details of crosslinking , which may depend on the particular complement of DNA - associated proteins at a given genomic locus 33 – 35 . Our simulations show that a larger contact radius for simulated 3C can also obscure the exist - ence of a dynamic looping interaction ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Additional measurement noise may also come from library complexity , sequencing depth , and ligations in solution 23 , 33 , 35 – 37 , which could all obscure the detection of looping interactions in 3C - based methods ( reviewed in ref . 36 ) . Together , these simulated perturbations to the idealized FISH and 3C protocols illustrate how considering many experi - mental details will be required to fully reconcile observations from FISH and Hi - C . loop - extrusion simulations can display divergent contact frequency and spatial distance After considering spatial distance and contact frequency in this minimal model , we then considered their relationship in simula - tions of loop extrusion with locus - specific boundary elements , recently proposed by us 38 and others 39 , 40 as explaining key aspects of interphase chromosome organization . Loop extrusion is a potential mechanism for the formation of TADs and loops in mammalian Hi - C maps , making it a subject of recent interest 41 – 45 ( for review , see ref . 1 ) . To consider genomic scales similar to those of the published 23 loop - control pairs considered above , we simu - lated a genomic region containing several TADs of 210 – 870 kb , with parameters of the chromatin fiber as defined in our previous study of interphase loop extrusion 38 . For each loop at the cor - ner of every TAD , we considered a matched control at the same genomic separation , but offset by 100 kb . 0 . 00 0 . 01 0 . 02 C on t a c t f r equen cy C on t r o l 1 5 C on t r o l 2 5 S pa t i a l d i s t an c e 0 4 8 12 0 . 00 0 . 04 0 . 08 C on t r o l 2 5 L oo p 2 5 0 4 8 12 b 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 – 6 . 4 – 4 . 8 – 3 . 2 – 1 . 6 0 . 0 log ( contact probability ) CD F Spatial distance ( monomers ) e a c d Control 25 Loop 25 Control 15 Control 25 Loop 25 Control 15 Control 15 Figure 4 | Simulations clarify the complex relationship between contact frequency and median spatial distance .

In simulations , we found that certain combinations of these parameters led to loop – control pairs with seemingly paradoxical relationships ( Fig . 5 ) . Such relationships could emerge because , much as in the mini - mal dynamic loop model considered above , certain regimes of loop extrusion can greatly increase contact frequency between subsequent boundary elements while minimally altering aver - age spatial distance ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . In our simulations , the number of seemingly paradoxical pairs increased with larger separation , and also for slower loop extrusion ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Interestingly , the best - fitting parameters from the sweep in our previous study 38 did not produce seemingly paradoxi - cal pairs for the considered TAD sizes . However , simply making loop extrusion slower was sufficient to create seemingly para - doxical pairs , while having little effect on the simulated contact map ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . This indicates that perturbing loop - extrusion dynamics could alter average FISH distances while having little effect on Hi - C contact maps , and thus using Hi - C alone to infer mechanisms of chromosomal folding may be insufficient . disCussion Our results illustrate that while median spatial distance and contact frequency are often inversely proportional , they are far from equivalent . Indeed , our simulations show that a relatively minor perturbation—the existence of a dynamic looping interac - tion between two loci—clearly breaks the equivalence between these two quantities . In particular , we show that there is great freedom to make large shifts in contact frequency with small shifts to median spatial distance , since contacts between distal chromosomal loci are generally rare events . We then show that loop extrusion can similarly break the typical correspondence between median spatial distance and contact frequency . Together , our simulations demonstrate that our expectation in vivo should be a nontrivial relationship between contact frequency and spatial distance , and that Hi - C and FISH data together will be necessary to better understand chromosome organization . Given these factors , 3C experiments cannot be simply validated ( or invalidated ) by FISH without carefully considering technical details of the two methods . Indeed , efforts to integrate results from these technologies will need to carefully address unknowns of the 3C capture radius and FISH localization uncertainty , in addition to assaying sufficiently large numbers of cells to populate the small - distance portion of the FISH distribution . While here we limit ourselves to considering the relatively simple compari - son between 3C and two - locus FISH , many other comparisons would be valuable in future work , including how to best integrate information obtained from contiguously stained regions 11 , 17 with Hi - C experiments . In addition to the implications for validation , our results also caution against certain modeling approaches . In particular , our results show how a common strategy of simply transforming ensemble average 3C contact frequencies into spatial distances ultimately leads to inconsistent models of chromosomal organiza - tion ( reviewed in ref . 8 ) . Finally , our results also demonstrate how polymer modeling can in principle be used to reconcile FISH spatial distances and 3C or Hi - C contact frequencies . This is because both quantities are readily calculable from an ensemble of simulated polymer con - formations . One of the central goals of the recently formed 4DN consortium is to systematically compare Hi - C and high - through - put high - resolution imaging data and understand any potential discrepancies ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 103499 ) . As these matched data become available , systematically comparing polymer models to both Hi - C and imaging data will be an essential step toward understanding principles of chromosomal organization . methods Methods , including statements of data availability and any associated accession codes and references , are available in the online version of the paper .

Polymer models were simulated with OpenMM 30 , 31 , a high - performance GPU - assisted molecular dynamics software ( https : / / simtk . org / home / openmm ) . We used an in - house openmm - polymer library to implement simulations ( pub - licly available http : / / bitbucket . org / mirnylab / openmm - polymer ) . Dynamic loop simulations . Dynamic loop simulations were per - formed as in the work of Doyle et al . , 2014 29 , albeit with a dynami - cally interacting loop rather than a static loop , implemented as described below . Following Doyle et al . , we modeled chromatin as a semi - flexible polymer fiber with excluded volume interactions , where spherical monomers of 15 - nm diameter represent ~ 500 bp , or approximately three nucleosomes . Adjacent monomers were connected by harmonic bonds with a potential U = 25 * ( r – 1 ) 2 ( here and below , energy is in units of kT ) . The stiffness of the fiber was modeled by a three point interaction term , with the potential U = k * ( 1 – cos ( α ) ) , where α is an angle between neighboring bonds and k is a parameter controlling stiffness , here set to 1 kT . To model the dynamic loop considered in the present work , we used a Lennard – Jones ( LJ ) potential U = 4 ε ij * ( 1 / r 12 – 1 / r 6 ) where ε ij was set to 4 kT for the monomers at the base of the dynamic loop ( i , j ) , and was set to negligibly small otherwise ( ε = 0 . 1 kT ) . We ini - tialized our simulations as a system of 8 compact rings ( see ref . 47 ) , and used periodic boundary conditions to achieve a density of 0 . 10 ( in the middle of the estimated range for mammalian cells 48 ) . We then simulated 50 runs of this system using Langevin dynamics , for 10e8 time steps . For the fiber lengths considered here , polymer simulations reached equilibrium in less than 1e7 time steps ; this was confirmed by observing that monomer dis - placement saturates after about 5e6 time steps . Conformations were saved every 1e5 time steps and an equilibrium ensemble of 900 conformations obtained after the initial equilibration was used for our analysis . To obtain simulated contact maps , we first found all contacts within each polymer conformation , and then aggregated these contacts for all pairs of monomers . Following ref . 29 , a con - tact was defined as two monomers being at a distance less than 3 monomer diameters . To obtain simulated FISH distributions , we calculated a list of spatial distances for a chosen set of loci , and built a histogram of distances starting at 0 in bins of 0 . 1 mono - mers . To display PDFs this histogram was then smoothed with a moving average window with a size of 0 . 7 monomers . Loop - extrusion simulations . Loop - extrusion simulations were performed as in ref . 38 with slight modification to the sizes and number of TADs , and an upgraded loop - extruding factor ( LEF ) simulation engine . To better span the genomic size range of TADs and loops probed by FISH in ref . 23 , we considered simulations of a 6 - Mb region , with 10 , 000 monomers , 12 TADs , and monomers representing 600 bp as in ref . 38 . These TADs were separated by 11 boundary elements that stalled loop extrusion , positioned at monomers : 750 , 1 , 550 , 1 , 900 , 3 , 000 , 3 , 650 , 4 , 300 , 5 , 750 , 6 , 550 , 6 , 900 , 7 , 550 , 9 , 000 . We used the same fiber stiffness and the same volume density as in the best - fitting model in ref . 38 : density of 0 . 2 and stiffness of 2 ; where values of parameters are as defined as previously . In the upgraded the loop - extruding factor ( LEF ) simulation engine , simulations do not need to be re - initialized between each subsequent step of loop extrusion . Instead , simulations are done in blocks of 100 loop - extrusion steps . At the start of each block , all LEF - mediated bonds that would occur in the next 100 loop - extrusion steps were initialized , and all but current ( step = 0 ) bonds were given a strength of zero . Current bonds were given the same strengths as previously . Langevin dynamics ( LD ) was then advanced by a certain number of LD timesteps , reflecting the relative velocity of loop extrusion ( 1 , 000 , 5 , 000 , 20 , 000 used in this manuscript ) . After that , strengths of the bonds were adjusted such that only bonds that exist at step = 1 of loop extrusion have nonzero strengths . This allowed us to avoid restarting simulations between subsequent extrusion steps , and do so only every 100 extrusion steps . The new engine lead to significant performance improvement , as it eliminated the necessity to frequently restart simulations . The reason for this updated scheme , with blocks of 100 LEF steps , is that OpenMM does not allow addition or removal of bonds once a simulation is initialized , but does allow for changing bond strengths . The new engine also allowed us to advance loop extrusion by only one step at a time ( 4 steps were used previously to decrease the number of restarts ) . This addi - tionally allows higher - fidelity simulations of loop extrusion , with less abrupt motion of the polymer after updating the positions of bonds imposed by loop extrusion . The new loop - extrusion engine was added to the example folder of the openmmlib pack - age ( http : / / bitbucket . org / mirnylab / openmm - polymer ) . We performed simulations for three different loop - extrusion speeds : 1 , 000 , 5 , 000 , and 20 , 000 LD steps per LEF step . Simulations with 1000 LD steps were run for 2 , 000 , 000 blocks of LD ; simula - tions with 5 , 000 steps were run for 500 , 000 blocks of LD , and simulations with 20 , 000 steps were run for 250 , 000 blocks of LD . We obtained every 20th block for the simulation with 20 steps , and every 5th block for other simulations , yielding 100 , 000 total conformation for simulations with 1 , 000 and 5 , 000 LD steps per LEF step , and 50 , 000 conformations for 20 , 000 LD steps . Contact maps were built using capture radius of 10 monomers . Simulated FISH distributions were calculated as above . Experimental data .
