This analysis revealed possible new consequences of perturbations to the p53 and Wnt / b - catenin pathways , identiﬁed a potential role for circRNAs in the epithelial - mesenchymal transi - tion , and provided new information about proteomic markers of clinical and genomic tumor subgroups , including relationships to known druggable path - ways . An extensive genome - wide acetylation survey yielded insights into regulatory mechanisms linking Wnt signaling and histone acetylation . We also char - acterized aspects of the tumor immune landscape , including immunogenic alterations , neoantigens , common cancer / testis antigens , and the immune microenvironment , all of which can inform immuno - therapy decisions . Collectively , our multi - omic ana - lyses provide a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians , identify new molecular associations of potential mechanistic signiﬁcance in the develop - ment of endometrial cancers , and suggest novel approaches for identifying potential therapeutic targets . INTRODUCTION Endometrial carcinoma ( EC ) is the sixth - most - common cancer in women globally ( Bray et al . , 2018 ) , with an estimated 61 , 880 new cases and 12 , 160 deaths in the United States in 2019 ( Siegel et al . , 2019 ) . Most women diagnosed with EC have early - stage disease and favorable outcomes ; this is particularly true for well - differentiated cancers with endometrioid histology ( Amant et al . , 2005 ) . However , there is a subset of low - grade , early - stage , well - differentiated endometrioid tumors in which unex - pected recurrences and poor outcomes do occur .

EC is one of the few human malignancies for which mortality is increasing ( Amer - ican Cancer Society , 2017 ) , which underscores the urgent need to develop more effective strategies for the diagnosis and treat - ment of this disease . The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) recently published a comprehensive genomic study of serous and endometrioid EC and reported four genomic subtypes : POLE , a rare ultramutated subtype with endometrioid histology and good prognosis ; micro - satellite instability ( MSI ) , a hypermutated endometrioid subtype ; copy - number ( CNV ) low , which consists of most of the rest of the endometrioid cases ; and CNV - high , comprised of all serous and the most aggressive endometrioid cancers ( Kandoth et al . , 2013 ) . To improve our understanding of the functional impact of the genomic alterations characterized by TCGA , we con - ducted an extensive multi - omic characterization of EC samples and appropriate normal tissues from a prospective cohort of 95 EC patients , under the auspices of the National Cancer Insti - tute’s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium ( CPTAC ) . Integrated measurements of DNA , RNA , proteins , and post - translational modiﬁcations ( phosphorylation and acetylation ) were used to identify novel regulatory relationships and potential avenues for identifying therapeutic targets . RESULTS Overview of the Proteogenomic Landscape We obtained 95 prospectively collected EC tumors ( 83 endo - metrioid and 12 serous ) and 49 normal tissue samples for multi - omic characterization . The clinical and pathological char - acteristics of the tumors are summarized in Table S1 . Each sam - ple underwent whole exome , whole genome , and total and miRNA sequencing , along with DNA methylation analyses . In addition , the relative levels of the proteins and post - translational modiﬁcation ( PTM ) sites across the tumor and normal tissue samples were quantiﬁed ( Figure 1 ; Figure S1A ) by using isobaric labeling with a universal reference strategy ( Mertins et al . , 2016 ; Zhang et al . , 2016a ) , applying a stringent 1 % false discovery rate ( FDR ) cutoff at the protein level . The methods and results , quan - tiﬁcation results , and normalization methods were carefully eval - uated to conﬁrm data quality ( STAR Methods ; Figures S1B – 1L ) . Processed data tables are available in Table S2 , the cptac Py - thon package , and LinkedOmics ( Vasaikar et al . , 2018 ) ; raw data are available via the Genomic Data Commons ( GDC ) and CPTAC Data Portal ( STAR Methods ) . Tumors were classiﬁed into the four genomic subtypes out - lined in the TCGA EC landmark study ( Kandoth et al . , 2013 ) : POLE , MSI , CNV - low ( also called endometrioid - like ) , or CNV - high ( also called serous - like ) ( STAR Methods ; Figure 1 ; Table S3 ) . Note that the endometrioid histological subtype mostly seg - regates into the POLE , MSI , and CNV - low genomic subtypes , whereas CNV - high consists of all serous tumors and a small number of endometrioid tumors . Our cohort included 7 POLE , 25 MSI , 43 CNV - low , and 20 CNV - high tumors ( Figure 1 ) . Protein and PTM levels differing between genomic subtypes ( FDR < 0 . 05 , Wilcoxon rank - sum test ) are shown in Figure 1 ( also see Table S3 ) . Functional analysis of protein levels by subtype indi - cated a relative downregulation of cell cycle proteins and phos - phorylation in the CNV - low subtype , associated with an increase in cell transport and metabolism proteins . Furthermore , phos - phorylation on proteins related to DNA double - strand break repair was decreased without a corresponding protein level change ( Table S3 ) . Conversely , the CNV - high subtype had increased phosphorylation on proteins involved in ATM signaling . As expected , mismatch repair was generally sup - pressed in POLE , MSI , and CNV - high subtypes . Serous samples have the highest upregulation of ribosome biogenesis , which has been associated with poor cancer prognosis ( Pelletier et al . , 2018 ) . Roughly 61 % of all somatic mutations were found in the seven POLE tumors ( n = 32 , 340 ; 32 , 188 point mutations and 152 Boris Reva , 15 Yuxing Liao , 1 , 2 , 3 Dmitry Rykunov , 15 Antonio Colaprico , 16 , 17 Xi Steven Chen , 16 , 17 Andrzej Czeka (cid:1) nski , 18 , 19 Marcin Je˛dryka , 18 , 19 Rafa 1 Matkowski , 18 , 19 Maciej Wiznerowicz , 20 , 21 , 22 Tara Hiltke , 23 Emily Boja , 23 Christopher R .

MSI tumors carried 88 % of all indels in the cohort ( n = 5 , 061 ) , and a focused analysis on microsatellite indels found higher mutation rates for signiﬁcantly mutated genes ( SMGs ) in this subtype than previously reported , including PTEN ( 92 % ) , ARID1A ( 76 % ) , and RPL22 ( 64 % ) ( all FDR = 0 , STAR Methods ) . We additionally identiﬁed INPPL1 ( 56 % ) , KMT2B ( 56 % ) , and JAK1 ( 44 % ) as putative SMGs in the MSI subtype , which were not reported in the TCGA study ( Figure S2A ) ( FDR = 0 , 0 . 001 , and 6 . 4e - 07 , respectively , STAR Methods ) . Of note , all of the JAK1 frameshift mutations were in MSI samples and were derived from microsatellite indels ( Figure S2B ) . JAK1 mutations , which are associated with high tumor grade ( Figure S2C ) , could promote immune evasion in MSI samples ( see Antigen Process - ing and Presentation Deﬁciency ) . Using a conservative proteo - genomics approach ( STAR Methods ) , we were able to conﬁrm 206 putative somatic coding variants at the protein level , along with 85 novel splice junctions ( Table S4 ) . The set of genes frequently altered by copy number variation , including ERBB2 , CCNE1 , FGFR3 , and IGF1R , was similar to that in the TCGA cohort . In summary , the genomic characteristics of our prospective EC cohort are consistent with those of the prior TCGA study , with the exception of some increases in observed mutations that could be attributable to differences in the DNA sequencing platforms used . Somatic Drivers Impact the Cancer Proteome and Phosphoproteome We examined the impact of somatic driver mutations on the proteome and phosphoproteome , both cis - acting ( acting on the gene in which the mutation occurs ) and trans - acting ( acting on other genes ) , focusing on 18 SMGs ( STAR Methods ) . Of these 18 SMGs , we identiﬁed 7 and 6 genes with cis and trans effects , respectively ( FDR < 0 . 05 , Wilcoxon rank - sum test ) . We Figure 1 .

For each sample , we display mutation load , copy number indices ( at both global and arm levels ) , and mutation status in SMGs . See also Figure S2 ; Table S3 . Cell 180 , 729 – 748 , February 20 , 2020 731 found a total of 143 trans associations ( 71 at the protein level and 72 phosphosites ) spanning 49 interacting proteins . The largest trans associations at both protein and phosphorylation levels involved mutations in ARID1A , TP53 , and CTNNB1 , likely in connection with their known regulatory roles ( STAR Methods , Figure 2A ) ( Bailey et al . , 2018 ) . As expected , in tumors with TP53 mutations , we observed an increase in levels of p53 itself , as well as in other proteins in the p53 pathway ( e . g . , CDK1 and CHEK1 ) . Through a similar process , we observed reduced levels of phosphorylated ARID1A , MAP3K4 , KMT2D , and INPPL1 in cis but increased levels of phosphorylated b - catenin and p53 ( Figure 2A ) . By assessing truncating and missense mutations separately , we detected distinct effects of the two mutation types on RNA , protein , and phosphoprotein levels of several key genes ( Fig - ure 2B ) . Missense mutations can either promote or stiﬂe gene expression at the protein level , though this was rarely reﬂected at the RNA level . As observed previously , there was an increase in protein levels of b - catenin and p53 associated with known hot - spot mutations ( Gao et al . , 2017 ; Suad et al . , 2009 ) and a D E C A B Figure 2 .

The effect of mutations on pro - tein levels in our cohort tended to correlate well with phospho - protein levels ; taken together with the lack of variance in RNA levels , this suggests strong translational and protein - stability - related regulation , especially as these patterns persist even when the hypermutated POLE and MSI tumors are removed from the analysis ( Figure S3A ) . Truncating mutations , mean - while , led to decreases in ARID1A , INPPL1 , JAK1 , PTEN , and RBM27 protein levels . Effects of CTNNB1 Mutations Exon 3 of CTNNB1 , an SMG that codes for the protein b - cate - nin , is known to have several mutational hotspots at or near phosphorylation sites that , when altered , lead to constitutive b - catenin activation . Altered b - catenin is thought to drive tumorigenesis in multiple cancers ( Gao et al . , 2017 ) , notably colorectal cancer ( Wong and Pignatelli , 2002 ) and EC ( Machin et al . , 2002 ) . EC patients with low - stage , low - grade endome - trioid tumors , who would normally have a good prognosis , have a much higher chance of recurrence when CTNNB1 is mutated , although the reason for this is unclear ( Kurnit et al . , 2017 ; Myers et al . , 2014 ) . To understand the underlying mech - anism , we analyzed the impact of hotspot CTNNB1 mutations , which were found in 23 tumors in the cohort , on the proteome and phosphoproteome ( Figure 2C ; Figure S3B ) . Of these 23 tu - mors , all but two are CNV - low or MSI , none are higher than grade 2 , and only three are stage III ; the rest are stage II or lower . We observed increased protein and phosphoprotein levels of known physically interacting complex partners and up - stream regulators of b - catenin in tumors with hotspot mutations ( Figure 2C ; Figures S3C and S3D ) . b - catenin , APC , and AXIN1 form the b - catenin destruction complex that serves as a major mediator within the Wnt signaling pathway ; APC and AXIN1 protein levels were also upregulated in CTNNB1 - mutated tu - mors ( Figure S3E ) . In fact , tumors with CTNNB1 hotspot muta - tions had higher Wnt signaling pathway activity ( STAR Methods ) than did their WT MSI and CNV - low counterparts ( Figure S3F ) ( p = 2 . 5e - 3 , Student’s t test ) . This study marks the ﬁrst instance of co - identiﬁcation of CTNNB1 complex part - ners and upstream regulators via global mass spectrometry - based proteomics . We used HotSpot3D ( Niu et al . , 2016 ) to assess whether 3D proximity of a mutation to a PTM can affect the protein . Indeed , the CTNNB1 exon 3 hotspot region ( centered at S33 ) formed a 3D cluster , consisting of the phosphosites at Y30 , S33 , and T40 , as well as recurrent mutations at D32 and G34 ( Figure 2C ) . This suggests a possible reason why mutated non - phosphosite residues in this region result in the same phenotype as mutations directly in the phosphosite codons . An alternative upstream mechanism for b - catenin overex - pression in EC involves the deactivation of APC , which normally promotes phosphorylation of b - catenin , leading to b - catenin degradation . In the 11 tumors without mutation - phosphosite overlaps in CTNNB1 but with mutations in APC , we observed reduced levels of APC and higher levels of b - catenin , although this increase was much less pronounced than that observed in tumors with CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations . Conversely , when considering CTNNB1 exon 3 mutants on their own , we observed regular protein levels of APC ( Figure S3E ) . By ac - counting for the proximity of mutations to phosphosites , we found that our results were consistent with the two mutually exclusive mechanisms for increasing b - catenin levels : either somatic mutation in CTNNB1 hotspots or mutational inactiva - tion of APC . To summarize , we observed co - regulation of CTNNB1 and key interacting proteins , including reciprocal activating mutations of CTNNB1 and inactivating mutations of APC as modulators of b - catenin levels , as well as providing mechanistic insight into the roles of speciﬁc CTNNB1 mutations . Effects of TP53 Mutations TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers ( Hainaut and Pfeifer , 2016 ) . TP53 mutations were observed in 23 tumors in our cohort , including all serous carcinomas . Instead of grouping all TP53 - mutated tumors together and looking for a single molecular phenotype , we segregated them by mutation type and location . We identiﬁed several proteomic and phospho - proteomic signatures that are consistent with the emerging hy - pothesis of neofunctionalization for hotspot missense mutations ( Kim et al . , 2015 ; Lang et al . , 2004 ) . Eleven tumors harbored missense mutations in a spatially clustered hotspot in p53’s DNA - binding domain ( Suad et al . , 2009 ) ( Figure 2D ) , which led to elevated protein levels ( Figure 2E ) . This cluster included the highly recurrent mutated residues R248 and R273 that interfere with p53’s ability to bind DNA ( Mello and Attardi , 2013 ) and cause cascading dysregulation of downstream proteins including AURKA ( Nikulenkov et al . , 2012 ) and XRN2 ( p = 7 . 8e - 06 , t test ) , an exoribonuclease that promotes the epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and metastasis ( Zhang et al . , 2017a ) . A variety of truncating TP53 mutations were found in seven tumors . Although the observed truncating mutations did not alter p53 protein levels ( p = 0 . 082 , t test ) , they were neverthe - less associated with downstream effects , including increased phosphorylation of PLK1 - T210 , which triggers recovery from the G2 DNA damage checkpoint ( Mac (cid:3) urek et al . , 2008 ; Paschal et al . , 2012 ) and mitotic entry ( Vigneron et al . , 2018 ) . Indeed , tu - mors with truncating TP53 mutations are enriched for mitotic cells ; among 14 mitotic marker proteins ( Ly et al . , 2017 ) , most showed increased levels in tumors with TP53 mutations ( Fig - ure S3G ) . This is likely caused by aberrant p53 function in mutant samples allowing cells to enter mitosis despite having DNA dam - age that would be detected in TP53 WT tumors . A third subset of p53 interacting proteins , including CDK1 , XPO1 , and TPX2 , was dysregulated whenever TP53 was mutated regardless of the speciﬁc type of mutation . Although TP53 hotspot mutations have been extensively stud - ied , including the likely differential functional consequences be - tween truncating mutations and neofunctionalization hotspot mutations , the actual effects of distinct TP53 mutations on the protein level of trans - interacting proteins in speciﬁc cancers have not been well described prior to this study . The mutation - type - speciﬁc effects described above appear to be unique to EC ; we examined the CPTAC data for ovarian and colon cancer , where TP53 mutations are very common , but observed no change in AURKA , CDK1 , XPO1 , or STK11 protein levels associ - ated with the type of TP53 mutation ( Figure S3H ) . Cell 180 , 729 – 748 , February 20 , 2020 733 A C E B F D ( legend on next page ) 734 Cell 180 , 729 – 748 , February 20 , 2020 Regulation of Histone Acetylation Characterization of the patient - derived cancer tissue acetylome has been limited . Similar to previous work in cell lines ( Choudh - ary et al . , 2009 , 2014 ) , we observed an enrichment in EC tumors of acetylated proteins involved with splicing , RNA transport , pro - tein synthesis and degradation , and metabolic pathways ( Fig - ure S4A ) . We observed a large degree of heterogeneity in histone acetylation patterns across tumor samples ( Figure S4B ) but no strong association with discrete genomic subtypes or clinical features . We found positive associations between BRD3 protein levels and several H2B N - terminal acetylation sites , as well as negative associations between SIRT1 , SIRT3 , BRD4 protein levels , and H3K27 and K36 acetylation levels ( Figure 3A ; Fig - ure S4C ) . This suggests that BRD3 can potentially bind to H2B N - terminal acetyl residues , which could make them less acces - sible to erasers and prevent their deacetylation . In addition , negative correlations between SIRT1 and SIRT3 and H3 acetyla - tion indicate that these histone deacetylases couldregulate H3K27 and K36 acetylation levels . Overall , we identiﬁed 322 sites that are upregulated ( n = 216 ) or downregulated ( n = 106 ) in tumor samples as compared with normal samples ( Figure 3B ; STAR Methods ) . We assessed how histone acetylation is affected by mutations in EC and found upregulation of H2B N - terminal acetylation sites K16 , K20 , and K24 in samples with CTNNB1 hotspot mutations ( Figures 3C and 3D ; Figure S4D ) and upregulation of H3 sites , including K27 and K36 , in both ARID1A - and KRAS - mutated samples ( Figures 3E and 3F ) . Previous reports have underscored the importance of acetylation - driven mechanisms in Wnt signaling ( Alok et al . , 2017 ; Le´vy et al . , 2004 ; Wolf et al . , 2002 ) ; we observed increases in BRD3 and SIRT1 protein levels in CTNNB1 hotspot mutants that were consistent with the observed effects of CTNNB1 hotspot mutations on H2B acetyla - tion ( Figure S4D ) . Additionally , we observe an upregulation of gene expression in several Wnt pathway genes in samples with high H2B acetylation levels ( Figure S4E ) . We identiﬁed 56 downregulated sites and 16 upregulated sites in the CNV - low subtype as compared with the CNV - high subtype ( Figure S4F ) . One upregulated site , FOXA2 - K274 , has been found , when deacetylated , to decrease FOXA2 stability ( van Gent et al . , 2014 ) . FOXA2 itself has been linked to increased cell proliferation and invasion in colon cancer ( Wang et al . , 2018 ) . Hence , the increased FOXA2 acetylation could indicate improved stability and activity of the protein , which might pro - mote proliferation of CNV - low EC tumors . However , FOXA2 has also been found to inhibit metastasis in lung adenocarci - nomas ( Li et al . , 2015 ; Tang et al . , 2011 ) , so further work is required to deﬁne the role of FOXA2 acetylation in EC . Our observations highlight the heterogeneity of the acetylome in EC and the potential impact of mutations in SMGs on histone acetylation levels , which could have overarching effects on tu - mor biology via newly identiﬁed interactions with the Wnt signaling pathway , BRD proteins , and methylation proteins . The extent to which these relationships are speciﬁc to EC or a general effect of CTNNB1 mutations on histone acetylation will require similar comprehensive studies of the acetylome in other cancers . Additionally , we identify tumor - speciﬁc upregulation of acetylation levels in translation elongation factors and methyl - transferase proteins , as well as a potential role for FOXA2 in the more aggressive CNV - high subtype . Multi - omic Analysis Reveals DNA Methylation and Somatic Copy Number Alteration Drivers DNA methylation ( DNAme ) analysis revealed elevated genome - wide CpG island DNAme in MSI tumors ( Figure S5A ) , which is consistent with previous reports ( Horowitz et al . , 2002 ; Tao and Freudenheim , 2010 ) . Methylation - silenced genes include MLH1 , an essential component of the DNA mismatch repair ( MMR ) machinery ( Figure 4A ; Figure S5B ) . We also found that several HOX family members were silenced by DNAme ( Fig - ure 4A ) . HOX genes have been previously connected to dou - ble - strand DNA break ( DSB ) repair ( Feltes , 2019 ) . We identiﬁed an anticorrelation between HOX protein levels and H2AX protein phosphorylation , a molecular indicator of DSBs . There has been speculation that tumors with MMR defects are also more prone to have DSBs ( Nowosielska and Marinus , 2008 ) . Our results sug - gest that increased methylation of the relevant factors could partially account for the dampening of both of these DNA repair pathways ( Figure S5B ) . Integrated analysis of somatic copy - number alterations ( SCNAs ) with transcriptomic and proteomic data revealed that 14 % of all SCNAs were associated with cis effects ( FDR < 0 . 01 , Spearman’s test ) . The SCNAs with the strongest trans ef - fects ( i . e . , demonstrating a broader impact on global gene expression ) were centered on chromosomes 1q , 3q , 4q , and 20q ( Figure 4B ; Table S5 ) and were identiﬁed in the CNV - high tumors ( Figure S5C ) . Proteins whose levels were positively associated with 3q ampliﬁcation included DNA replication and cell cycle proteins , such as cyclin - dependent kinases and mini - chromosome maintenance family members ( FDR < 0 . 05 , hyper - geometric test , Figure S5D ) . The pathways most impacted by 4q loss included cytoskeleton and cilium assembly ( Figure S5E ) ; interestingly , ciliopathy has recently emerged as an indicator of tumor onset ( Sa´nchez and Dynlacht , 2016 ) . Chromosome 1q ampliﬁcation was the only SCNA commonly observed in both MSI and microsatellite stable ( MSS ) tumors . Consistent with previous ﬁndings ( Horowitz et al . , 2002 ; Tao and Freudenheim , 2010 ) , we conﬁrmed that 1q ampliﬁcation was anticorrelated with p53 pathway activity ( p < 0 . 01 , Pearson’s correlation , Figure 4C ; STAR Methods ) .

( legend continued on next page ) 736 Cell 180 , 729 – 748 , February 20 , 2020 mutations are rare in MSI tumors , we speculated that 1q ampli - ﬁcation could be a major mechanism in repression of p53 pathway activity in these tumors . We conﬁrmed that the mRNA levels of MDM4 , a gene located in 1q that codes for a previously reported p53 inhibitor ( Depreeuw et al . , 2017 ) , were increased along with its copy number ( p < 0 . 01 , Spearman’s correlation ) . However , we did not detect the MDM4 protein , likely due to low abundance . To identify potential p53 pathway inhibitors with protein evidence , we ranked all genes based on the anticor - relation between their protein level and p53 activity and high - lighted the ones with SCNA cis effects ( Figure 4D ) . As expected , genes mapping to 1q exhibited stronger negative correlation with p53 pathway activity than did other genes ( p = 3 . 4e - 4 , STAR Methods ) . That negative correlation was even stronger for 1q genes with SCNA - protein correlation than for other 1q genes ( p = 1 . 1e - 4 , GSEA ) , suggesting a role for SCNA - driven overexpression of 1q genes in repressing p53 pathway activity . The top - ranked genes included many histone modiﬁers including SETDB1 , SDE2 , PARP1 , and GATAD2B ( Figures 4D and 4E ) . SETDB1 , the strongest candidate , showed anticorrelation to p53 pathway target proteins , including the cell cycle repressor CDKN1A and the apoptotic protein TNFRSF10B ( Figure 4F ; Figure S5F ) ( Pappas et al . , 2017 ) . Our analysis supports the possibility that the SCNA driver genes en - coded on chromosome 1q inhibit p53 activity by repressing p53 pathway components or downstream target genes . Discovery of a Potential Role for circRNAs in EMT Regulation Circular RNAs ( circRNAs ) have recently drawn interest for their role in tumor biology ( Chen et al . , 2019 ; Dragomir and Calin , 2018 ; Hansen et al . , 2013 ; Kristensen et al . , 2018 ; Vo et al . , 2019 ) . We identiﬁed 234 recurrent circRNAs ( see Figure S6A for the ten most commonly observed ) . The circRNA from the tu - mor - suppressor gene FBXW7 can be translated into a protein product that can reduce the half - life of c - Myc ( Yang et al . , 2018 ) ; two other circRNAs , circHIPK3 and circDOCK1 , are known to regulate cell growth and serve as cancer biomarkers ( Zhang et al . , 2017b ; Zheng et al . , 2016 ) . We observed an overall positive correlation among circRNAs ; such correlation was not observed among their host genes ( Figure 5A ) , suggesting core - gulation of circRNAs at the global level . To identify possible regulators , we correlated the protein levels of all RNA - binding proteins ( RBPs ) with circRNA levels ( Figure 5B ; Table S5 ) . The protein level of QKI , a recently reported circRNA regulator ( Conn et al . , 2015 ) , was positively correlated with 35 circRNAs , whereas the protein level of ESRP2 was negatively correlated with 20 circRNAs . These RBPs might serve as master regulators of circRNAs . QKI is upregulated during EMT and can promote EMT by regulating hundreds of alternative splicing targets ( Conn et al . , 2015 ; Nieto et al . , 2016 ; Pillman et al . , 2018 ) . We found a positive correlation between relative QKI protein level and EMT score ( Figure 5C ; STAR Methods ) and with the EMT ac - tivators ZEB1 and ZEB2 ( Krebs et al . , 2017 ; Zhang et al . , 2015 ) ( Figures S6B and S6C ) . The level of ESRP2 , which plays an important role in maintaining epithelial features ( Warzecha and Carstens , 2012 ; Warzecha et al . , 2009 ) , was negatively corre - lated with QKI level , as previously reported ( Conn et al . , 2015 ; Ishii et al . , 2014 ; Mizutani et al . , 2016 ) ( Figure 5D ) . Because miRNAs play critical roles in EMT ( Zaravinos , 2015 ) , and circRNAs can serve as miRNA sponges to regulate miRNA activity , we predicted miRNA binding sites in the 35 circRNAs that were correlated with QKI level , ﬁnding potential binding sites for 36 miRNAs ( p < 0 . 02 , Figure S6D ; STAR Methods ) . We further predicted sample - speciﬁc activities of these miRNAs based on the level of their known mRNA targets ( STAR Methods ) . We found that the activities of these miRNAs were negatively corre - lated with QKI expression , although their abundances showed varying relationships with QKI levels ( Figure 5E ) . This suggests that the activity of these miRNAs might be opposed by QKI , possibly through QKI - mediated expression of circRNAs . Inter - estingly , we found known QKI regulators miR - 200c and miR - 221 ( Cochrane et al . , 2009 ; Mukohyama et al . , 2017 ; Pillman et al . , 2018 ) among the miRNAs with the strongest negative cor - relations between their activity and QKI levels ; this set of miRNAs also included miR - 130a , miR - 130b , and miR - 183 , which are pre - dicted QKI regulators ( Figures S6E – S6I ) ( Dweep et al . , 2011 ; Lewis et al . , 2005 ) . In summary , the observed positive correlation between QKI and circRNAs , and the negative correlation of QKI with the activity of speciﬁc miRNAs , suggests a mechanism pro - moting the EMT in EC ( Figure 5F ) . Proteomic Markers of Clinical and Genomic Tumor Subtypes We compared proteomic and transcriptomic changes between subtypes ( Table S6 ) . Protein and mRNA changes were highly correlated for all subtypes ( Figures S7A – S7C ) . When comparing MSI to MSS tumors , we conﬁrmed that MLH1 and EPM2AIP1 were downregulated in MSI samples at both the protein and mRNA levels ( Figure 6A ) , likely due to methylation of their shared promoter ( Figure 4A ) , a common cause of microsatellite insta - bility ( Simpkins et al . , 1999 ) . However , PMS1 and PMS2 , two binding partners of MLH1 , were downregulated only at the pro - tein level ( Figure 6A ; Figure S7D ) . The stability of these proteins is known to decrease in the absence of MLH1 ( Chang et al . , 2000 ) . We further identiﬁed upregulation of RPL22L1 in MSI ( C ) 1q ampliﬁcation is anticorrelated with p53 pathway activity . The samples are ranked based on their inferred p53 pathway activity .

Its paralog gene , RPL22 , is mutated in many of the MSI tumors , and RPL22L1 pro - tein levels were highest in these tumors ( Figure 6B , p = 0 . 002 , rank - sum test ) . MSI tumors could upregulate RPL22L1 to compensate for the loss of RPL22 ; indeed , it has been shown that RPL22 and RPL22L1 share a synthetic lethal relationship ( McDonald et al . , 2017 ) . When comparing serous to endometrioid tumors , the most striking observation was that TP53BP1 - S1763 and CHEK2 - S163 were highly phosphorylated in serous tumors ( Figure 6C ) . These sites are among those phosphorylated by PLK1 to inacti - vate the DNA damage response ( DDR ) and drive progression through the G2M checkpoint ( van Vugt et al . , 2010 ) . The levels of phosphorylated TP53BP1 - S1763 and CHEK2 - S163 were correlated with PLK1 protein levels ( Figures 6D and 6E ) , which correlated in turn with G2M checkpoint score ( Figure 6F , R = 0 . 67 , p = 7 . 9e - 14 ) , indicating progression through the G2M checkpoint . These results are consistent with previous studies showing that overexpression of PLK1 is a driver of chromosomal instability ( de Ca´rcer et al . , 2018 ) and that DDR and G2M check - pointactivationarecloselylinked ( Liuetal . , 2000 ; Matsuokaetal . , 1998 ; Sancar et al . , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 2015 ) .

DDR score for our samples based on known DDR marker phosphoproteins ( Matsuoka et al . , 2007 ) ( STAR Methods ; Figure S7E ) . As expected , we found that PLK1 protein level ( Figure 6G ; and Fig - ure S7F ) and G2M protein level ( Fig - ure S7H ) were higher in samples with a high DDR score , as was phosphorylation on CHEK2 - S163 ( Figure S7G ) , even though neither protein was incorporated into the DDR score . DDR - high samples were enriched for serous tumors and therefore the CNV - high subtype , but the DDR - high endometrioid tumors came from the CNV - high , POLE , and MSI genomic subgroups ( Figure S7E ) , indi - cating that active DNA damage signaling is largely independent of genomic subtype . In order to nominate new chemotherapeutic targets for DDR - high tumors , we compared hyperphosphorylation , a proxy for abnormally high activity ( Huang et al . , 2017 ; Mertins et al . , 2016 ; Mundt et al . , 2018 ) , between DDR - high and DDR - low tu - mors , and found that several proteins that have known interac - tions with FDA - approved drugs were hyperphosphorylated in DDR - high samples ( Figure 6H ) . In particular , DNMT1 is a protein that was hyperphosphorylated in both endometrioid and serous DDR - high tumors . This protein has several known inhibitors , including azacitidine and decitabine ( Hollenbach et al . , 2010 ) , that have demonstrated use in treating several myelodysplastic syndromes and other blood cancers . This ﬁnding highlights the potential for personalized therapy beyond traditional PARP in - hibitors in tumors with elevated DNA damage . The subset of endometrioid samples that are CNV - high have a prognosis that is similar to the more aggressive serous histotype ( Kandoth et al . , 2013 ) . It is useful to determine whether they are also similar to serous tumors at a molecular level and therefore susceptible to the same treatments . It is also critical to determine what molecular underpinnings differentiate these tumors from the more treatable endometrioid tumors in the other three genomic subgroups , both in order to facilitate early diagnosis 738 Cell 180 , 729 – 748 , February 20 , 2020 G H I B A C F E D Figure 6 .

Cell 180 , 729 – 748 , February 20 , 2020 739 and to pinpoint possible therapeutic targets . Although no pro - teins were differentially expressed between CNV - high endome - trioid and non - CNV - high samples or between CNV - high serous and non - CNV - high samples , a subset of proteins were differen - tially hyperphosphorylated ; 45 proteins were hyperphosphory - lated in both endometrioid and serous CNV - high samples , whereas 479 proteins were hyperphosphorylated exclusively in the serous comparison and 53 exclusively in the endometrioid comparison ( Figure S7I ) . Because patients with CNV - high tu - mors have a particularly poor prognosis regardless of histology , we focused on identifying promising targets for future studies developing new chemotherapy drugs by ﬁnding proteins that are likely to be hyperactivated in CNV - high samples ( Blumen - berg et al . , 2019 ) .

See also Table S7 . six have potentially useful known drug in - teractions ; two of these , CDK12 and SMARCA4 , are targeted by FDA - approved drugs ( Figure 6I ) . Of the pro - teins differentially phosphorylated only in endometrioid CNV - high samples , six additional proteins have known drug in - teractions , including one protein ( PML ) that is the target of an FDA - approved anti - neoplastic drug ( Figure 6I ) . As a speciﬁc example , CDK12 is known to modulate the susceptibility of ovarian cancer to the PARP inhibitor olaparib ( Bajrami et al . , 2014 ) ; the hyperphosphorylation of CDK12 in EC suggests potential utility as a target for sensitization of EC to PARP in - hibitors . In addition , targeting of CDK12 has been shown to enhance responses to immune checkpoint blockade ( Omar and Tolba , 2019 ) , suggesting utility as an adjunct to immunotherapy . Finally , kinase activity inferred from phosphopro - teomic data identiﬁed several kinases activated in CNV - high endometrioid tu - mors compared to CNV - low tumors , including CDK4 , which can be targeted by multiple FDA - approved drugs ( Fig - ure S7J ; Table S6 ) . Tumor Antigens as Putative Vaccine Antigens Tumor antigens , including cancer / testis ( CT ) antigens and neoantigens derived from somatic mutations , can serve as candidates for vaccine development in cancer immunotherapy ( Almeida et al . , 2009 ; Lee et al . , 2003 ) . We found protein evidence for putative neoan - tigens in 49 . 3 % of the samples . The POLE molecular subtype contained the highest number of neoantigens per sample , fol - lowed by the MSI subtype ( Figure 7A ) . Eight known CT antigens were observed in R 10 % of tumors using a cutoff of R 3 - fold level increase in tumor samples as compared with normal tissue ( Fig - ure 7A ) . Overall , 59 % of tumors contained at least one CT anti - gen . Unlike neoantigen expression , CT antigen expression was independent of POLE and MSI status . CT antigen IGF2BP3 was highly upregulated in serous tumors as compared with en - dometrioid ; it has been identiﬁed as a biomarker of serous histol - ogy ( Mhawech - Fauceglia et al . , 2010 ; Zheng et al . , 2008 ) . We 740 Cell 180 , 729 – 748 , February 20 , 2020 also observed overexpression of ATAD2 or PBK CT antigens , both of which have also been suggested as potential clinical bio - markers for EC ( Berg et al . , 2017 ; Krakstad et al . , 2015 ) . In addi - tion to serving as cancer biomarkers , CT antigens are inherently immunogenic . For example , peptides derived from IGF2BP3 have been shown to be immunogenic in vitro ( Suda et al . , 2007 ) and in vivo in human esophageal cancer ( Kono et al . , 2009 ) . Overall , 78 % of tumors had either evidence of a neoanti - gen or high expression of a common CT antigen ( Figure 7A ; Table S7 ) , demonstrating the utility of proteogenomics in identi - fying potential tumor antigens for vaccine development in cancer immunotherapy . Antigen Processing and Presentation Deﬁciency Immunecheckpointinhibitionis anincreasingly successfulcancer immunotherapy . Higher tumor - mutation burden ( TMB ) has been shown to predict clinical beneﬁt of immune checkpoint inhibition across human cancers ( Samstein et al . , 2019 ) . However , effective immune targeting of tumor cells also requires that the cellular an - tigen processing and presentation machinery ( APM ) effectively displays the tumor antigens that allow T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells ( Baxevanis et al . , 2019 ; Eggermont et al . , 2014 ) . We found high variation in APM efﬁciency ( estimated based on APM protein levels , see STAR Methods ) that was independent of TMB ( Figure 7B ) . We divided the tumors into four groups based on TMB and APM scores ( STAR Methods ) . We then quantiﬁed the immune - cell inﬁltration scores of each tumor with single sample gene - set enrichment analysis based on recently published im - mune - cell signatures ( STAR Methods ; Table S7 ) ( Charoentong et al . , 2017 ) . Cell - type immune scores ( p < 0 . 05 , one - way ANOVA ) are shown in Figure 7C . Consistent with the inference above , the TMB - high and APM - low ( TMB - H / APM - L ) group had a relatively lower immune score for most of the immune cells than the TMB - high and APM - high ( TMB - H / APM - H ) group , including cytotoxic CD8 + T cells . Interestingly , TMB - low and APM - high ( TMB - L / APM - H ) had the highest immune score despite its low TMB . However , the highscore appears tobe dependent on high levels of suppressive immune cells , including myeloid - derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells ( Bianchi et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2017 ) ; this group had lower inﬁltration of acti - vated CD8 + and CD4 + T cells than did TMB - H / APM - H , which is suggestive of an immunosuppressive microenvironment . These results indicate that TMB and APM act independently to shape the tumor immune microenvironment in EC and could indepen - dently recruit different populations of immune cells . Although recent studies have shown TMB to be an indepen - dent predictor of response to immunotherapy ( Goodman et al . , 2017 ; Samstein et al . , 2019 ) , our results showed that high - TMB tumors have diverse APM efﬁciency and immune microenviron - ments . Based on the prevalence of microsatellite indel - derived JAK1 mutations in MSI EC samples ( Figure 1 ) and a correlation between the presence of microsatellite indel - derived JAK1 mu - tations and higher tumor grade in both this and the TCGA cohort ( Figure S2C ) , we focused our analysis on the JAK / STAT pathway , which activates interferon ( IFN ) pathways to regulate antigen presentation ( Aaronson and Horvath , 2002 ; Schindler et al . , 2007 ) . We observed that the TMB - H / APM - L group had lower IFN g and IFN a activity than the TMB - H / APM - H group ( Fig - ure 7C ) . The two POLE samples in the TMB - H / APM - L group had truncation mutations in JAK1 and STAT1 , respectively ( Fig - ure 7D ) ; we also found enrichment of JAK1 truncation mutations in the TMB - H / APM - L group . Because most of the JAK1 trunca - tion mutations in MSI tumors are derived from microsatellite indels , which are much more common in EC than in the MSI subtype of colon cancer ( Kim et al . , 2013 ) ( Figure S2B ) , JAK1 mi - crosatellite indels could represent a major immune evasion mechanism in MSI EC , a theory which has also been considered in other cancer types ( Shin et al . , 2017 ; Stelloo et al . , 2016 ) . TMB - H / APM - L tumors without JAK1 / STAT1 mutations had lower protein levels of antigen peptide transporters including TAP1 , TAP2 , and TAP2BP , providing an alternative mechanism for repressing antigen presentation and suppressing anti - tumor immune response ( Harel et al . , 2019 ) . Moreover , HLA protein levels were lower in TMB - H / APM - L tumors than in TMB - H / APM - H tumors . In summary , these results suggest several possible mechanisms by which EC cells could suppress the APM , leading to immune evasion . Although the FDA has approved MSI as a marker of immunotherapy for solid tumors ( Lemery et al . , 2017 ) , our results suggest that JAK1 / STAT1 mu - tations and TAP levels , which are markers of APM deﬁciency , should also be taken into account when selecting EC patients for treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors . DISCUSSION This study provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular systems of EC at the genomic , transcriptomic , and proteomic levels . We conﬁrmed protein - level expression of predicted events previously described at the genomic and transcriptomic level . Beyond that , we clearly demonstrated that distinct EC subtypes can be reliably distinguished by their patterns of protein levels and subsequent post - translational modiﬁcations . Although it is currently unclear how the distinct genomic subtypes deﬁned by TCGA can best be leveraged to improve outcomes for women diagnosed withEC , the functional information providedbyproteo - mic measurements , including protein phosphorylation and acety - lation , provides a basis for a deeper understanding of EC biology and new approaches to clinical management . A perennial issue has been the identiﬁcation of the subset of low - grade , low - stage EC with paradoxically poor outcomes . Constitutive b - catenin activation through CTNNB1 mutations and other mechanisms has previously been associated with less favorable outcomes in low - grade , low - stage endometrioid EC ( Liu et al . , 2014 ) . In this paper , we identify collaborating mechanisms of pathway activation arising when the known ef - fects of CTNNB1 somatic mutations are coupled with APC mu - tations . These ﬁndings could help reﬁne which tumors will behave in a more aggressive manner than expected and expand the range of biomarkers used for adjuvant therapies . The consequences of various common TP53 mutations are thought to affect treatment outcomes ( Meng et al . , 2018 ) ; here we describe the effect of gain - of - function TP53 mutations on the Aurora kinase pathway , supporting reported associations between AURKA expression and poor outcomes in EC ( Umene et al . , 2015 ) and providing a theoretical basis for the use of AURKA inhibitors in these tumors . On a related note , 1q Cell 180 , 729 – 748 , February 20 , 2020 741 ampliﬁcation has been associated with poor outcomes in seem - ingly favorable endometrioid EC ( Depreeuw et al . , 2017 ) . These observations could be used to stratify treatment for more aggressive EC tumors . EMT is an important component of EC progression with prog - nostic implications ( Tanaka et al . , 2013 ) . In this study we uncov - ered evidence for a novel regulatory pathway involving QKI , circRNA , and ESRP2 . ESRP2 regulates alternative splicing events associated with epithelial phenotypes of cells ( Ishii et al . , 2014 ) and plays a critical role during EMT by regulating iso - forms of FGFR2 , CD44 , CTNND1 , and ENAH ( Lamouille et al . , 2014 ; Warzecha et al . , 2009 ) . Through its known function in iso - form regulation , ESRP2 could also directly regulate circRNA levels , and , if so , it could compete with QKI in circRNA - mediated gene regulation . Further work is needed to investigate the inter - play of ESRP2 with circRNAs in EMT . High - grade endometrioid and serous EC are associated with frequent recurrences and poor clinical outcomes even when diagnosed at early stages ; unfortunately , consistently effective therapeutic options for these cancers are limited . We have iden - tiﬁed multiple gene products that are highly expressed in the CNV - high subset of ECs that includes all serous EC and many of the high - grade ECs proﬁled . One of these gene products , CDK12 , can be targeted to enhance clinical responses to im - mune checkpoint blockade ( Omar and Tolba , 2019 ) , providing an opportunity for improved selection of EC patients for check - point blockade immunotherapy . Long - term , these observations posit multiple strategies potentially useful for clinically managing CNV - high and other EC subtypes . It will be important to deter - mine whether the distinguishing features we have observed are associated with distinct rates of tumor recurrence , response to therapy , and clinical outcomes as the demographic data avail - able for this prospective cohort continues to mature . Although immunotherapy approaches , including checkpoint inhibition and tumor vaccination , have been highly successful as cancer treatments , a signiﬁcant proportion of patients fail to respond to these therapies . Our results indicate that measuring the capability of the tumor to process and present antigens would provide additional and possibly more effective criteria for the selection of patients for immunotherapy beyond the sim - ple measurement of tumor mutation burden . Integrating comprehensive quantitative measurements of pro - tein , phosphorylation , and acetylation with genomic and tran - scriptomic measurements not only has provided novel insights into fundamental biological processes associated with carcino - genesis but also has provided intriguing leads for new therapeu - tic approaches in EC , including potential criteria for selecting the most appropriate therapies . Although the results presented herein are predominantly observational , they provide the basis for multiple hypotheses of clinical relevance that can and should be further explored by the scientiﬁc community .

EC cases were graded using the FIGO ( International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics ) system or the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM staging system , which are functionally identical . METHOD DETAILS Sample Collection The CPTAC Biospecimen Core Resource ( BCR ) at the Pathology and Biorepository Core of the Van Andel Research Institute in Grand Rapids , Michigan manufactured and distributed biospecimen kits to the Tissue Source Sites ( TSS ) located in the US , Europe , and Asia . Each kit contained a set of pre - manufactured labels for unique tracking of every specimen respective to TSS location , disease , and sample type , used to track the specimens through the BCR to the CPTAC proteomic and genomic characterization centers . Tissue specimens averaging 250 mg were snap - frozen by the TSS within a 30 min cold ischemic time ( CIT ) ( CIT average = 18 min ) and an adjacent segment was formalin - ﬁxed parafﬁn - embedded ( FFPE ) and H & E stained by the TSS for quality assessment to meet the CPTAC EC requirements . Routinely , several tissue segments for each case were collected . Tissues were ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen ( LN 2 ) then transferred to a liquid nitrogen freezer for storage until approval for shipment to the BCR . Specimens were shipped using a cryoport that maintained an average temperature of under (cid:1) 140 (cid:3) C to the BCR with a time and temperature tracker to monitor the shipment . Receipt of specimens at the BCR included a physical inspection and review of the time and temperature tracker data for specimen integrity , followed by barcode entry into a biospecimen tracking database . Specimens were again placed in storage at LN 2 temperatures until further processing . Acceptable EC tumor tissue segments were determined by TSS pathologists based on the percent viable tumor nuclei ( > 80 % ) , total cellularity ( > 50 % ) , and necrosis ( < 20 % ) . Segments received at the BCR were veriﬁed by BCR and Leidos Biomedical Research ( LBR ) pathologists and the percent of total area of tumor in the segment was also documented . Additionally , disease - speciﬁc working group pathology experts reviewed the morphology to clarify or standardize speciﬁc disease classiﬁcations and correlation to the proteomic and genomic data . Specimens selected for the discovery set were determined on the maximal percent in the pathology criteria and best weight . Spec - imens were pulled from the biorepository using an LN 2 cryocart to maintain specimen integrity and then cryopulverized . The cryopulverized specimen was divided into aliquots for DNA ( 30mg ) and RNA ( 30mg ) isolation and proteomics ( 50mg ) for molecular characterization . Nucleic acids were isolated and stored at (cid:1) 80 (cid:3) C until further processing and distribution ; cryopulverized protein material was returned to the LN 2 freezer until distribution . Shipment of the cryopulverized segments used cryoports for distribution to the proteomic characterization centers and shipment of the nucleic acids used dry ice shippers for distribution to the genomic characterization centers ; a shipment manifest accompanied all distributions for the receipt and integrity inspection of the specimens at the destination . The DNA sequencing was performed at the Broad Institute , Cambridge , MA and RNA sequencing was performed at the University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , NC . Material for proteomic analyses was sent to the Proteomic Characterization Cen - ter ( PCC ) at Paciﬁc Northwest National Laboratory ( PNNL ) , Richland , Washington . Sample Processing for Genomic DNA and Total RNA Extraction Our study sampled a single site of the primary tumor from surgical resections , due to the internal requirement to process a minimum of 125mg of tumor issue and 50mg of adjacent normal tissue . DNA and RNA were extracted from tumor and adjacent normal spec - imens in a co - isolation protocol using QIAGEN’s QIAsymphony DNA Mini Kit and QIAsymphony RNA Kit . Genomic DNA was also isolated from peripheral blood ( 3 - 5mL ) to serve as matched normal reference material . The Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit was used with the Qubit (cid:2) 2 . 0 Fluorometer to determine the concentration of dsDNA in an aqueous solution . Any sample that passed quality control and produced enough DNA yield to go through various genomic assays was sent for genomic characterization . RNA quality was quantiﬁed using both the NanoDrop 8000 and quality assessed using Agilent Bioanalyzer . A sample that passed RNA quality control and had a minimum RIN ( RNA integrity number ) score of 7 was subjected to RNA sequencing . Identity match for germ - line , normal adjacent tissue , and tumor tissue was assayed at the BCR using the Illumina Inﬁnium QC array . This beadchip contains 15 , 949 markers designed to prioritize sample tracking , quality control , and stratiﬁcation . The genomic DNA and total RNA extraction were only applied to a subset of adjacent normal tissues without enrichment for endometrium . Whole Exome Sequencing Library Construction Library construction was performed as described in ( Fisher et al . , 2011 ) , with the following modiﬁcations : initial genomic DNA input into shearing was reduced from 3 m g to 20 - 250ng in 50 m L of solution . For adaptor ligation , Illumina paired - end adapters were replaced with palindromic forked adapters , purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies , with unique dual - indexed molecular barcode se - quences to facilitate downstream pooling . Kapa HyperPrep reagents in 96 - reaction kit format were used for end repair / A - tailing , adaptor ligation , and library enrichment PCR . In addition , during the post - enrichment SPRI cleanup , elution volume was reduced to 30 m L to maximize library concentration , and a vortexing step was added to maximize the amount of template eluted . In - solution Hybrid Selection After library construction , libraries were pooled into groups of up to 96 samples . Hybridization and capture were performed using the relevant components of Illumina’s Nextera Exome Kit and following the manufacturer’s suggested protocol , with the following excep - tions . First , all libraries within a library construction plate were pooled prior to hybridization . Second , the Midi plate from Illumina’s Cell 180 , 729 – 748 . e1 – e13 , February 20 , 2020 e3 Nextera Exome Kit was replaced with a skirted PCR plate to facilitate automation . All hybridization and capture steps were automated on the Agilent Bravo liquid handling system . Preparation of Libraries for Cluster Ampliﬁcation and Sequencing After post - capture enrichment , library pools were quantiﬁed using qPCR ( automated assay on the Agilent Bravo ) using a kit pur - chased from KAPA Biosystems with probes speciﬁc to the ends of the adapters . Based on qPCR quantiﬁcation , libraries were normalized to 2nM . Cluster Ampliﬁcation and Sequencing Cluster ampliﬁcation of DNA libraries was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( Illumina ) using exclusion ampliﬁca - tion chemistry and ﬂowcells . Flowcells were sequenced utilizing sequencing - by - synthesis chemistry . The ﬂowcells were then analyzed using RTA v . 2 . 7 . 3 or later . Each pool of whole exome libraries was sequenced on paired 76 cycle runs with two 8 cycle index reads across the number of lanes needed to meet coverage for all libraries in the pool . Pooled libraries were run on HiSeq4000 paired - end runs to achieve a minimum of 150x on target coverage per each sample library . The raw Illumina sequence data were demulti - plexed and converted to fastq ﬁles ; adaptor and low - quality sequences were trimmed . The raw reads were mapped to the hg38 human reference genome and the validated bams were used for downstream analysis and variant calling . PCR - Free Whole Genome Sequencing Preparation of Libraries for Cluster Ampliﬁcation and Sequencing An aliquot of genomic DNA ( 350ng in 50 m L ) was used as the input into DNA fragmentation ( aka shearing ) . Shearing was performed acoustically using a Covaris focused - ultrasonicator , targeting 385bp fragments . Following fragmentation , additional size selection was performed using a SPRI cleanup . Library preparation was performed using a commercially available kit provided by KAPA Bio - systems ( KAPA Hyper Prep without ampliﬁcation module ) and with palindromic forked adapters with unique 8 - base index sequences embedded within the adaptor ( purchased from IDT ) . Following sample preparation , libraries were quantiﬁed using quantitative PCR ( kit purchased from KAPA Biosystems ) , with probes speciﬁc to the ends of the adapters . This assay was automated using Agilent’s Bravo liquid handling platform . Based on qPCR quantiﬁcation , libraries were normalized to 1 . 7nM and pooled into 24 - plexes . Cluster Ampliﬁcation and Sequencing ( HiSeq X ) Sample pools were combined with HiSeqX Cluster Amp Reagents EPX1 , EPX2 , and EPX3 into single wells on a strip tube using the Hamilton Starlet Liquid Handling system . Cluster ampliﬁcation of the templates was performed according to the manufacturer’s pro - tocol ( Illumina ) with the Illumina cBot . Flowcells were sequenced to a minimum of 15x on HiSeqX utilizing sequencing - by - synthesis kits to produce 151bp paired - end reads . Output from Illumina software was processed by the Picard data processing pipeline to yield BAM ﬁles containing demultiplexed , aggregated , aligned reads . All sample information tracking was performed by automated LIMS messaging . Illumina Inﬁnium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Array The MethylationEPIC array uses an 8 - sample version of the Illumina Beadchip capturing > 850 , 000 methylation sites per sample . 250ng of DNA was used for the bisulﬁte conversation using Inﬁnium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Kit . The EPIC array includes sample plating , bisulﬁte conversion , and methylation array processing . After scanning , the data was processed through an automated ge - notype calling pipeline . Data generated consisted of raw idats and a sample sheet . RNA Sequencing QA and QC of RNA Analytes All RNA analytes were assayed for RNA integrity , concentration , and fragment size . Samples for total RNA - seq were quantiﬁed on a TapeStation system ( Agilent , Inc . Santa Clara , CA ) . Samples with RINs > 8 . 0 were considered high quality . Total RNA - seq Library Construction Total RNA Libraries were prepared on an Agilent Bravo Automated Liquid Handling System . Quality control was performed at every step , and the libraries were quantiﬁed using a TapeStation system . Total RNA Sequencing Indexed libraries were prepared and run on HiSeq4000 paired - end 75 base pairs to generate a minimum of 120 million reads per sample library with a target of greater than 90 % mapped reads . The raw Illumina sequence data were demultiplexed and converted to fastq ﬁles , and adaptor and low - quality sequences were quantiﬁed . Samples were then assessed for quality by mapping reads to hg38 , estimating the total number of mapped reads , amount of RNA mapping to coding regions , amount of rRNA in sample , number of genes expressed , and relative expression of housekeeping genes . Samples passing this QA / QC were then clustered with other expression data from similar and distinct tumor types to conﬁrm expected expression patterns . Atypical samples were then SNP typed from the RNA data to conﬁrm source analyte . FASTQ ﬁles of all reads were then uploaded to the GDC repository . miRNA - seq Library Construction miRNA - seq library construction was performed from the RNA samples using the NEXTﬂex Small RNA - Seq Kit ( v3 , PerkinElmer , Wal - tham , MA ) and barcoded with individual tags following the manufacturer’s instructions . Libraries were prepared on Sciclone Liquid Handling Workstation . Quality control was performed at every step , and the libraries were quantiﬁed using a TapeStation system and an Agilent Bioanalyzer using the Small RNA analysis kit . Pooled libraries were then size selected according to NEXTﬂex Kit speciﬁ - cations using a Pippin Prep system ( Sage Science , Beverly , MA ) . e4 Cell 180 , 729 – 748 . e1 – e13 , February 20 , 2020 miRNA Sequencing Indexed libraries were loaded on the HiSeq4000 to generate a minimum of 10 million reads per library with a minimum of 90 % reads mapped . The raw Illumina sequence data were demultiplexed and converted to FASTQ ﬁles for downstream analysis . Resultant data were analyzed using a variant of the small RNA quantiﬁcation pipeline developed for TCGA ( Chu et al . , 2016 ) . Samples were assessed for the number of miRNAs called , species diversity , and total abundance . Samples were uploaded to the GDC repository . MS Sample Processing and Data Collection Protein Extraction and Lys - C / Trypsin Tandem Digestion The cryopulverized tumor and normal uterine tissue samples were obtained through the CPTAC Biospecimen Core Resource . Approximately 50 mg of each of the pulverized uterine tumor and normal tissues were homogenized separately in 200 m L of lysis buffer ( 8 M urea , 75 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM EDTA , 2 m g / mL aprotinin , 10 m g / mL leupeptin , 1 mM PMSF , 10 mM NaF , 1 : 100 v / v Sigma phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2 , 1 : 100 v / v Sigma phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 3 , 20 m M PUGNAc , and 5 mM sodium butyrate ) . Lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 20 , 000 g for 10 min at 4 (cid:3) C and protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) and adjusted to 8 m g / m L with lysis buffer . Proteins were reduced with 5 mM di - thiothreitol for 1 h at 37 (cid:3) C and subsequently alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide for 45 min at 25 (cid:3) C in the dark . Samples were diluted 1 : 3 with 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 and digested with Lys - C ( Wako ) at 1 : 50 enzyme - to - substrate ratio . After 2 h of digestion at 25 (cid:3) C , an aliquot of the same amount of sequencing - grade modiﬁed trypsin ( Promega , V5117 ) was added to the samples and further incubated at 25 (cid:3) C for 14 h . The digested samples were then acidiﬁed with 100 % formic acid to 1 % of the ﬁnal concentration of formic acid and centrifuged for 15 min at 1 , 500 g at 4 (cid:3) C before transferring samples into new tubes leaving resulted pellet behind . Tryptic peptides were desalted on C18 SPE ( Waters tC18 SepPak , WAT054925 ) and dried using Speed - Vac . TMT - 10 Labeling of Peptides Desalted peptides from each sample were labeled with 10 - plex TMT reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) . Peptides ( 400 m g ) from each of the tumors were dissolved in 400 m L of 50 mM HEPES , pH 8 . 5 solution , and mixed with 3 . 2 mg of TMT reagent that was dissolved freshly in 164 m L of anhydrous acetonitrile . Channel 126 was used for la - beling the internal reference sample ( pooled from all tumor and normal samples ) throughout the sample analysis . After 1 h incubation at RT , 32 m L of 5 % hydroxylamine was added and incubated for 15 min at RT to quench the reaction . Peptides labeled by different TMT reagents were then mixed , dried using Speed - Vac , reconstituted with 3 % acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % formic acid and desalted on tC18 SepPak SPE columns . Peptide Fractionation by Basic Reversed - Phase Liquid Chromatography ( bRPLC ) Approximately 3 . 5 mg of 10 - plex TMT labeled sample was separated on a reversed phase Agilent Zorbax 300 Extend - C18 column ( 250 mm 3 4 . 6 mm column containing 3 . 5 - m m particles ) using the Agilent 1200 HPLC System . Solvent A was 4 . 5 mM ammonium formate , pH 10 , 2 % acetonitrile and solvent B was 4 . 5 mM ammonium formate , pH 10 , 90 % acetonitrile . The ﬂow rate was 1 mL / min and the injection volume was 900 m L . The LC gradient started with a linear increase of solvent B to 16 % in 6 min , then linearly increased to 40 % B in 60 min , 4 min to 44 % B , 5 min to 60 % B and another 14 of 60 % solvent B . A total of 96 fractions were collected into a 96 well plate throughout the LC gradient . These fractions were concatenated into 24 fractions by combining 4 fractions that are 24 fractions apart ( i . e . , combining fractions # 1 , # 25 , # 49 , and # 73 ; # 2 , # 26 , # 50 , and # 74 ; and so on ) . For proteome analysis , 5 % of each concatenated fraction was dried down and re - suspended in 2 % acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % formic acid to a peptide concentration of 0 . 1 mg / mL for LC - MS / MS analysis . The rest of the fractions ( 95 % ) were further concatenated into 12 fractions ( i . e . , by combining fractions # 1 and # 13 ; # 3 and # 15 ; and so on ) , dried down , and subjected to immobilized metal afﬁnity chromatography ( IMAC ) for phosphopeptide enrichment . Phosphopeptide Enrichment Using IMAC Fe 3 + - NTA - agarose beads were freshly prepared using the Ni - NTA Superﬂow agarose beads ( QIAGEN , # 30410 ) for phosphopeptide enrichment . For each of the 12 fractions , peptides were reconstituted in 500 m L IMAC binding / wash buffer ( 80 % acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % triﬂuoroacetic acid ) and incubated with 20 m L of the 50 % bead suspension for 30 min at RT . After incubation , the beads were sequen - tially washed with 50 m L of wash buffer ( 1X ) , 50 m L of 50 % acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % triﬂuoroacetic acid ( 1X ) , 50 m L of wash buffer ( 1X ) , and 50 m L of 1 % formic acid ( 1X ) on the stage tip packed with 2 discs of Empore C18 material ( Empore Octadecyl C18 , 47 mm ; Supleco , 66883 - U ) . Phosphopeptides were eluted from the beads on C18 using 70 m L of elution buffer ( 500 mM K 2 HPO 4 , pH 7 . 0 ) . Sixty micro - liter of 50 % acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % formic acid was used for elution of phosphopeptides from the C18 stage tips after two washes with 100 m L of 1 % formic acid . Samples were dried using Speed - Vac and later reconstituted with 10 m L of 3 % acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % formic acid for LC - MS / MS analysis . Immunoafﬁnity Puriﬁcation of Acetylated Peptides Tryptic peptides from the ﬂow - through of IMAC were combined into four samples follow concatenation scheme and dried down using Speed - Vac . The dried peptides were reconstituted in 1 . 4 mL of the immunoafﬁnity puriﬁcation ( IAP ) buffer ( 50 mM MOPS / NaOH pH 7 . 2 , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 and 50 mM NaCl ) . After dissolving the peptide , the pH of the peptide solution was checked using pH indicator paper . The amount of reconstituted peptides was quantiﬁed via BCA assay and concatenated into 4 fractions by combining 3 fractions that were 4 fractions apart ( i . e . , combining fractions # 1 , # 5 and # 9 as a new fraction ) . The antibody beads from PTMScan (cid:2) Acetyl - Lysine Motif [ Ac - K ] Kit ( Cell Signaling , # 13416 ) were freshly prepared . Brieﬂy , the antibody beads were centri - fuged at 2 , 000 x g for 30 s and all buffer from the beads were removed ; the antibody beads were then washed with 1 mL of IAP buffer Cell 180 , 729 – 748 . e1 – e13 , February 20 , 2020 e5 for four times and ﬁnally resuspend in 40 m L of IAP buffer . For each fraction , half of the antibody in each tube was transferred to the peptide solution and incubated on a rotator overnight at 4 (cid:3) C . After removing the supernatant , the reacted beads were washed with 1mL of PBS buffer ﬁve times . For the elution of acetylated peptides , the antibody beads were incubated 2 times each with 50 m L of 0 . 15 % TFA at room temperature for 10 min . The eluted peptides were transferred to the stage tip packed with two discs of Empore C18 material . The C18 stage tips were washed by 1 % formic acid and 50 % acetonitrile , and 0 . 1 % formic acid was used for elution of peptides from the C18 stage tips . The eluted peptides were dried using Speed - Vac , and reconstituted with 13 m L of 3 % acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % formic acid right before the LC - MS / MS analysis . The acetylated peptides prepared by IP from the IMAC ﬂow - through may very well miss those peptides that are both phosphor - ylated and acetylated . Splitting the samples for independent IP and IMAC may improve the chance of recovering such peptides , assuming having both PTMs on the same peptide does not impact the afﬁnity of either the IP or IMAC process . However , acetylated peptides are estimated to be 10 times lower in abundance than the phosphopeptides , hence much larger input may be needed to recover the dual - modiﬁed peptides . Given the extremely low stoichiometry of these dual - modiﬁed peptides and the sample size lim - itations , it was not pursued in this work . LC - MS / MS Analysis Fractionated samples prepared for global proteome , phosphoproteome , and acetylome analysis were separated using a nanoACQUITY UPLC system ( Waters ) by reversed - phase HPLC . The analytical column was manufactured in - house using ReproSil - Pur 120 C18 - AQ 1 . 9 m m stationary phase ( Dr . Maisch GmbH ) and slurry packed into a 25 - cm length of 360 m m o . d . x 75 m m i . d . fused silica picofrit capillary tubing ( New Objective ) . The analytical column was heated to 50 (cid:3) C using an AgileSLEEVE col - umn heater ( Analytical Sales and Services ) . The analytical column was equilibrated to 98 % Mobile Phase A ( MP A , 0 . 1 % formic acid / 3 % acetonitrile ) and 2 % Mobile Phase B ( MP B , 0 . 1 % formic acid / 90 % acetonitrile ) and maintained at a constant column ﬂow of 200 nL / min . The sample was injected into a 5 m L loop placed in - line with the analytical column which initiated the gradient proﬁle ( min : % MP B ) : 0 : 2 , 1 : 6 , 85 : 30 , 94 : 60 , 95 : 90 , 100 : 90 , 101 : 50 , 110 : 50 . The column was allowed to equilibrate at start conditions for 30 min between analytical runs . MS analysis was performed using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) . The global proteome and phosphoproteome samples were analyzed under identical conditions . Electrospray voltage ( 1 . 8 kV ) was applied at a carbon composite union ( Valco Instruments ) coupling a 360 m m o . d . x 20 m m i . d . fused silica extension from the LC gradient pump to the analytical column and the ion transfer tube was set at 250 (cid:3) C . Following a 25 - min delay from the time of sample injection , Orbitrap precursor spectra ( AGC 4x10 5 ) were collected from 350 - 1800 m / z for 110 min at a resolution of 60K along with data dependent Orbi - trap HCD MS / MS spectra ( centroid ) at a resolution of 50K ( AGC 1x10 5 ) and max ion time of 105 ms for a total duty cycle of 2 s . Masses selected for MS / MS were isolated ( quadrupole ) at a width of 0 . 7 m / z and fragmented using a collision energy of 30 % . Peptide mode was selected for monoisotopic precursor scan and charge state screening was enabled to reject unassigned 1 + , 7 + , 8 + , and > 8 + ions with a dynamic exclusion time of 45 s to discriminate against previously analyzed ions between ± 10 ppm . The acetylome sam - ples were analyzed under similar conditions except that the max ion time was 200 ms . Construction and Utilization of the Comparative Reference Samples As a quality control measure , two ‘‘Comparative Reference’’ ( ‘‘CompRef’’ ) samples were generated as previously described ( Li et al . , 2013 ; Tabb et al . , 2016 ) and used to monitor the longitudinal performance of the proteomics workﬂow throughout the course of this study . Brieﬂy , patient - derived xenograft ( PDX ) tumors from established basal and luminal breast cancer intrinsic subtypes were raised subcutaneously in 8 - week old NOD . Cg - Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl / SzJ mice ( Jackson Laboratories , Bar Harbor , ME ) using proced - ures reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Washington University in St . Louis . Xenografts were grown in multiple mice , pooled , and cryopulverized to provide a sufﬁcient amount of uniform material for the duration of the study . Full proteome , phosphoproteome and acetylome process replicates of each of the two CompRef samples were prepared and analyzed as standalone 10 - plex TMT experiments alongside every 4 TMT - 10 experiments of the study samples , using the same analysis protocol as the patient samples . These interstitially analyzed CompRef samples were evaluated for depth of proteome , phosphoproteome , and acetylome coverage and for consistency in quantitative comparison between the basal and luminal models . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Tumor Exclusion Criteria In the PCA analysis of proteomics ( Figures 1D and 1E ) and RNA - Seq data , three tumor samples were grouped with normal tissues . We estimated tumor purity using a methylation - based deconvolution method ( Onuchic et al . , 2016 ) . The three samples were found to have tumor purity < 10 % and were excluded from downstream analysis . Six more samples were excluded for other reasons , including four from histologic types where there were too few tumors for meaningful statistical analysis ( three carcinosarcoma and one clear cell ) , one which was not treatment - naive , and one which was a tumor that was analyzed twice ( the lower quality repli - cate was excluded ) . e6 Cell 180 , 729 – 748 . e1 – e13 , February 20 , 2020 Genomic Data Analysis Copy Number Calling Copy number variation was detected using BIC - seq2 ( Xi et al . , 2016 ) , a read depth – based CNV calling algorithm for WGS tumor data . Brieﬂy , BIC - seq2 divides genomic regions into disjoint bins and counts uniquely aligned reads for each bin . It then combines neigh - boring bins into genomic segments with similar copy numbers iteratively based on Bayesian information criteria ( BIC ) . We used paired - sample CNV calling that takes a pair of samples as inputs and detects genomic regions with different copy numbers between the two samples . We used a bin size of 100bp and a lambda of 3 ( smoothing parameter for CNV segmentation ) . Segments were called as copy gain or loss when their log2 copy ratios were larger than 0 . 2 or smaller than (cid:1) 0 . 2 , respectively . These cutoffs were obtained by comparing the proportion of ampliﬁcations and deletions in the EC TCGA study and adjusting the cutoffs to match the proportions in our cohort . To further summarize the arm - level copy number change , we used a weighted sum approach ( Vasaikar et al . , 2019 ) , in which the segment - level log2 copy ratios for all the segments located in the given arm were added up with the length of each segment being weighted . Somatic Variant Calling We called variants using paired tumor and blood normal from WXS data . Somatic variants were called by Strelka v . 2 ( Saunders et al . , 2012 ) , MUTECT v . 2 ( Cibulskis et al . , 2013 ) , VarScan v . 2 . 3 . 8 ( Koboldt et al . , 2012 ) , and Pindel v . 0 . 2 . 5 ( Ye et al . , 2009 ) . We kept SNVs called by any 2 callers among MUTECT v . 2 , VarScan v . 2 . 3 . 8 , and Strelka v . 2 and indels called by any 2 callers among MUTECT v . 2 , VarScan v . 2 . 3 . 8 , Strelka v . 2 , and Pindel v . 0 . 2 . 5 . For the merged SNVs and indels , we applied a 14X and 8X coverage cutoff for tumor and normal , separately . We also ﬁltered SNVs and indels by a minimal variant allele frequency ( VAF ) of 0 . 05 in tumors and a maximal VAF of 0 . 02 in normal samples . Finally , we ﬁltered any SNV which was within 10bp of an indel found in the same tumor sample . We identiﬁed a total of 52 , 630 somatic mutations , of which 5 , 757 were indels and 46 , 873 were point mutations . Speciﬁcally , there were 4 , 430 frameshift deletions , 1 , 035 frameshift insertions , 258 in - frame deletions , 34 in - frame insertions , 41 , 127 missense muta - tions , 4 , 580 nonsense mutations , 63 nonstop mutations , and 1 , 103 splice site mutations . We use MuSiC v0 . 4 in order to infer SMGs based on background mutation rate , coverage , gene length , etc . ( Dees et al . , 2012 ) . We cataloged PTM - overlapping mutations ( mutations located at most two amino acids away from a known PTM site ) in all genes ; genes with the most overlapping mutations were PTEN , MUC16 , CTNNB1 , MKI67 , and TP53 . When restricting to only phosphosites detected in our EC cohort , CTNNB1 had the most PTM - overlapping mutations . Mutational Signatures We use SignatureAnalyzer v0421 - 2017 ( Tan and Fe´votte , 2013 ) in order to infer mutational signatures for our cohort . We identiﬁed 6 signatures , which were mapped to the 30 mutational signatures from the Stratton study ( Alexandrov et al . , 2013 ) . Methylation Analysis The raw data from Illumina’s EPIC methylation arrays were available as IDAT ﬁles from the CPTAC consortium . The methylation analysis was performed using the cross - package workﬂow ‘‘methylationArrayAnalysis . ’’ Brieﬂy , the raw data ﬁles ( IDAT ﬁles ) were processed to obtain the methylated ( M ) and unmethylated ( U ) signal intensities for each locus . The processing step included an un - supervised normalization step called functional normalization that has been previously implemented for Illumina 450K methylation arrays ( Fortin et al . , 2014 ) . A detection p value was also calculated for each locus to capture the quality of detection at the locus with respect to negative control background probes included in the array . Loci having common SNPs ( MAF > 0 . 01 ) ( as per dbSNP build 132 through 147 via the UCSC snp132common track through snp147common track ) were removed from further analysis . Beta values were calculated as M / ( M + U ) ; that is , the fraction methylated for each locus . Beta values of loci whose detection p values were > 0 . 01 were assigned values of NA in the output ﬁle . All loci were annotated with the annotation information from ‘MethylationEPIC _ v - 1 - 0 _ B2 . csv’ from the zip archive ‘inﬁnium - methylationepic - v1 - 0 - b2 - manifest - ﬁle - csv . zip’ from https : / / www . illumina . com through the IlluminaHumanMethylationEPICanno . ilm10b2 . hg19 package on Bioconductor . For downstream integrated analysis , we focused only on the methylation levels ( represented as beta values ) of the probes located both in the CpG island and the promoter ( including 5 0 UTR ) regions . The gene - level methylation was derived by averaging these probe - level methylation values . Microsatellite Instability Prediction We used 5 criteria to predict microsatellite instability status : mutation load , mismatch repair ( MMR ) gene mutation status , MSIsensor ( v0 . 2 ) score , MSMuTect ( version 1 . 0 ) score , and MLH1 methylation . K - Means clustering method with 2 cluster centers was applied to mutation load , MSIsensor , MSMuTect , and MLH1 methylation . For each tool , samples in the higher group were assigned as MSI - H . Six MMR genes , MLH1 , MLH3 , MSH2 , MSH3 , MSH6 , and PSM2 , were considered in the analysis . Samples with a mutation in any of these genes were labeled as MSI - H for the MMR gene criterion . A sample was ofﬁcially called MSI - H if it was predicted to be MSI - H by no fewer than 3 of 5 methods ( Table S3 ) . Copy Number Classiﬁcation The copy number subtypes were mainly characterized by CNV deletion events . A sample was deﬁned as CNV - high more than 10 % of its genome was deleted , regardless of the number of CNV - independent events . However , a CNV event , deﬁned by the minimal copy number change ( in log2 scale ) , is dependent on the tumor purity . A sample with low purity will have a smaller change than samples with high purity . Here we deﬁned the per - sample threshold as 0 . 3 times the sample purity . Purity was estimated using ABSOLUTE ( Carter et al . , 2012 ) . Cell 180 , 729 – 748 . e1 – e13 , February 20 , 2020 e7 TCGA Subtype Classiﬁcation TCGA identiﬁed four subtypes of endometrial cancer : POLE , MSI , CNV - high , and CNV - low . We replicated this subtyping for the sam - ples in our study . The MSI subtype consists of all samples called MSI - H , as described in the Microsatellite Instability Prediction section . To identify the POLE subtype , which has better survival than other subtypes , we looked for samples with mutations in the POLE exonuclease domain ( McConechy et al . , 2016 ; Stelloo et al . , 2015 ; Talhouk et al . , 2017 ) . There were 8 samples carrying exonuclease domain mutations ( EDM ) in the cohort , including 7 missense mutations and 1 splice site mutation from the sample C3L - 01253 . How - ever , this sample failed to pass the criteria [ CA ] signature > 20 % and [ CG ] signature < 3 % . Thus , seven samples were classiﬁed as POLE . Samples identiﬁed as having high CNV , as described in the Copy Number Classiﬁcation section , were assigned to the CNV - high subgroup . All remaining samples not classiﬁed as MSI , POLE , or CNV - high were classiﬁed as CNV - low . HotSpot3D We conducted 3D structural clustering using HotSpot3D v1 . 8 . 2 with recurrence as the vertex type and a clustering distance of 10A˚ ( Niu et al . , 2016 ) . JAK1 Mutation Determination Gene level microsatellite instability ( MSI ) events from MSMuTect and gene mutation calling results were integrated to determine the JAK1 MS insertion / deletion status . There were nine MSI events from eight samples identiﬁed by both MSMuTect and mutation call - ing . Three JAK1 MSI events , which failed to pass ﬁltering steps from MSMuTect but had mutation calling evidence , were also clas - siﬁed as MS insertion / deletion . RNA Quantiﬁcation & Analysis RNA Quantiﬁcation and Circular RNA Prediction The Hg38 reference genome and RefSeq annotations were used for the RNaseq data analysis . They were downloaded from the UCSC table browser . First , CIRI ( v2 . 0 . 6 ) was used to call circular RNA with default parameters and BWA ( version 0 . 7 . 17 - r1188 ) was used as the mapping tool . The cutoff of supporting reads for circRNA was set to 10 . Then we used a pseudo - linear transcript strategy to quantify gene and circular RNA expression ( Li et al . , 2017 ) . In brief , for each sample , linear transcripts of circular RNAs were extracted and 75bp ( read length ) from the 3 0 end was copied to the 5 0 end . The modiﬁed transcripts were called pseudo - linear transcripts . Transcripts of linear genes were also extracted and mixed with pseudo - linear transcripts . RSEM ( version 1 . 3 . 1 ) with Bowtie2 ( version 2 . 3 . 3 ) as the mapping tool was used to quantify gene and circular RNA expression based on the mixed transcripts . After quantiﬁcation , the upper quantile method was applied for normalization . The normalized matrix was log2 - transformed and separated into gene and circular RNA expression matrices . miRNA - Seq Data Analysis Adapters of miRNaseq reads were trimmed using TRIMMOMATIC ( version 0 . 38 ) . The following constraints were used during trim - ming : 1 ) HEADCROP and TAILCROP were set to 4bp ; 2 ) Average read quality was set to 30 ; 3 ) Average base quality was set to 20 with a sliding window of 10bp ; 4 ) Trimmed reads shorter than 15 nucleotides in length were excluded from further analysis . Re - maining reads were then mapped to the human genome hg38 using BWA aln , allowing 0 mismatch and up to 10 mappings . 3 bp extension / shorten were allowed in both upstream and downstream regions of mature miRNA annotation to accommodate inaccu - rate processing of precursor miRNAs . Multiple aligned reads were equally distributed in counting . Then read counts were converted to RPM ( reads per million ) values using ( raw counts ) 3 10 6 / ( total count ) , where total count is the number of reads aligned to mature or precursor miRNAs . miRNA Binding Site Prediction RNA22 was used to predict miRNA binding sites on circRNAs with default parameters ( Miranda et al . , 2006 ) . The circRNA circCDR1as , which has 74 conﬁrmed miR - 7 binding sites , was used to determine the p value cutoff ( Memczak et al . , 2013 ) . RNA22 reported 49 potential binding sites of miR - 7 on this circRNA . The third quartile of p values , 0 . 0207 , was used as the cutoff for miRNA binding sites prediction . miRNAs with binding sites but without miRNA activity scores ( see Inferred Immune , EMT , APM , and miRNA Activity Scores ) were excluded from further analysis . After the ﬁltering , there were binding sites for 36 miRNAs from 16 of 35 QKI regulated circRNAs ( Figure S4C ) . Pathway Activity The PROGENy R package was applied to the log2 transformed RSEM mRNA matrix to estimate activity of 11 cancer related path - ways : EGFR , Hypoxia , JAK / STAT , MAPK , NFkB , PI3K , TGFb , TNFa , Trail , VEGF , p53 ( Schubert et al . , 2018 ) . MS Data Interpretation Quantiﬁcation of TMT Global Proteomics Data LC - MS / MS analysis of the TMT10 - labeled , bRPLC fractionated samples generated a total of 408 global proteomics data ﬁles . The Thermo RAW ﬁles were processed with mzReﬁnery to characterize and correct for any instrument calibration errors , and then with MS - GF + v9881 ( Gibbons et al . , 2015 ; Kim and Pevzner , 2014 ; Kim et al . , 2008 ) to match against the RefSeq human protein sequence database downloaded on June 29 , 2018 ( hg38 ; 41 , 734 proteins ) , combined with 264 contaminants ( e . g . , trypsin , keratin ) . The partially tryptic search used a ± 10 ppm parent ion tolerance , allowed for isotopic error in precursor ion selection , and searched a decoy e8 Cell 180 , 729 – 748 . e1 – e13 , February 20 , 2020 database composed of the forward and reversed protein sequences . MS - GF + considered static carbamidomethylation ( + 57 . 0215 Da ) on Cys residues and TMT modiﬁcation ( + 229 . 1629 Da ) on the peptide N terminus and Lys residues , and dynamic oxidation ( + 15 . 9949 Da ) on Met residues for searching the global proteome data . Peptide identiﬁcation stringency was set at a maximum false discovery rate ( FDR ) of 1 % at peptide level using PepQValue < 0 . 005 and parent ion mass deviation < 7 ppm criteria . A minimum of 6 unique peptides per 1000 amino acids of protein length was required for achieving 1 % at the protein level within the full dataset . Inference of parsimonious protein set resulted in the identiﬁcation of a total of 12 , 153 protein groups covering 11 , 099 genes . The intensities of all ten TMT reporter ions were extracted using MASIC software ( Monroe et al . , 2008 ) . Next , PSMs passing the conﬁdence thresholds described above were linked to the extracted reporter ion intensities by scan number . The reporter ion inten - sities from different scans and different bRPLC fractions corresponding to the same gene were grouped . Relative protein abundance was calculated as the ratio of sample abundance to reference abundance using the summed reporter ion intensities from peptides that could be uniquely mapped to a gene . The pooled reference sample was labeled with TMT 126 reagent , allowing comparison of relative protein abundances across different TMT - 10 plexes . The relative abundances were log2 transformed and zero - centered for each gene to obtain ﬁnal relative abundance values . Small differences in laboratory conditions and sample handling can result in systematic , sample - speciﬁc bias in the quantiﬁcation of protein levels . In order to mitigate these effects , we computed the median , log2 relative protein abundance for each sample and re - centered to achieve a common median of 0 . Evaluation of TMT Proteomics Data Coupled with extensive fractionation and tandem afﬁnity enrichment of the phosphopeptides and acetylated peptides , our 10 - plex TMT - based MS / MS workﬂow provided comprehensive proteomic coverage , conﬁdently identifying a total of 12 , 153 proteins ( 11 , 099 genes ) , 73 , 212 phosphosites , and 10 , 862 lysine acetylation sites across all tumors and an average of 10 , 088 proteins ( 9 , 765 genes ) , 29 , 710 phosphosites , and 3 , 821 lysine acetylation sites per tumor ( Table S2 ) . Stable longitudinal performance and low technical noise of the integrated proteomics platform were demonstrated by repeated interspersed analyses of QC samples ( Figures S1B and S1C ) . Principal component analysis clearly separated the tumors and normal endometrium tissue based on the TMT global pro - teome , phosphoproteome , or acetylome data and no batch effect was observed in the TMT plexes ( Figures S1D – S1F ) ( Wen et al . , 2017 ) . Steady - state mRNA and protein abundance showed a strong positive correlation ( median 0 . 48 ) ( Figure S1G ) . This average correlation was higher than the previous reported CPTAC colorectal ( r = 0 . 23 ) , breast ( r = 0 . 39 ) , and ovarian ( r = 0 . 45 ) mRNA - protein correlations . Around 78 % of all mRNA - protein pairs across the 95 samples showed signiﬁcant correlation ( adj p value < 0 . 01 ) . Eight normalization methods were tested for global proteomics matrix : 1 ) median normalization followed by batch correct ; 2 ) me - dian normalization ; 3 ) Median polish followed by batch correction ; 4 ) median polish ; 5 ) subtracted mean for each batch ; 6 ) median normalization ; 7 ) ﬁltering missing by batch followed by median normalization and batch correct ; 8 ) ﬁltering missing by batch followed by median normalization . The 50 % missing values cutoff for the whole cohort was used for methods 1 - 6 and the same cutoff for each TMT batch was used for methods 7 - 8 . The correlation in abundance between proteins from the same protein complex was used as a criterion to evaluate these methods and the performances are shown in Figure S1H . Methods 4 and 8 have the same performance and outperform other methods by the same criterion . However , method 4 has better classiﬁcation between serous and endometrioid . In sum , method 4 has the best performance for proteomics data . Similarly , six normalization methods were applied to the phosphoproteomics matrix : 1 ) median normalization with factor from pro - teomics data followed by batch correction ; 2 ) median normalization with factor from proteomics data ; 3 ) median normalization fol - lowed by batch correction ; 4 ) median normalization ; 5 ) median polish followed by batch correction ; 6 ) median polish . The 50 % missing values cutoff for the whole cohort was used for the analysis . The correlation between sites ( substrates ) from the same kinase was used as the criterion to evaluate these methods and performances are shown in Figure S1I . Method 6 outperforms other methods by the criterion . Quality Control via Machine Learning We also selected three clinically distinct phenotypes with at least 10 samples per group and compared the utility of multi - omics data to identify the phenotype of individual tumors using machine learning . Global proteomics data performed as well as most other tran - scriptomic and genomic data to distinguish between the histological serous and endometrioid subtypes ( Figure S1J ) . Similarly in identiﬁcation of samples with MSI , proteomics , RNA , and methylation data demonstrated comparable ability ( Figure S1K ) . While these phenotypes are visually or genomically distinct , low - grade FIGO stage 1B and 1A samples can be hard to differentiate , although pre - surgical classiﬁcation determines the necessity of lymphadenectomy ( Zhu et al . , 2017 ) . Proteomics data performed signiﬁcantly better ( median AUROC of 0 . 73 ) than any other data type in predicting whether a sample was stage 1B or stage 1A ( Figure S1L ) . Creation of a Patient - Speciﬁc Protein Sequence Database The proteogenomic database tool pyQUILTS ( Ruggles et al . , 2016 ) , available at http : / / quilts . fenyolab . org , was used to incorporate the germline and somatic single nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) , RNA - seq predicted junctions and fusion genes into a searchable protein database . The human RefSeq protein database ( downloaded 2018 / 06 / 29 ) was used as a reference for the hg38 proteome and genome . Cell 180 , 729 – 748 . e1 – e13 , February 20 , 2020 e9 Protein - Peptide Identiﬁcation and Quantiﬁcation with Patient - Speciﬁc Sequence Database Protein sequences output from pyQUILTS were digested in - silico to generate all unique tryptic peptides with up to one missed cleav - age allowing for N - terminal methionine cleavage . Isoleucine residues were then replaced with leucines to avoid I / L variants . The CPTAC3 reference proteome ( along with the human proteome downloaded from UniProt on 2016 / 07 / 29 ) were similarly processed to remove any possible reference peptides from the list of candidates , resulting in 5 , 295 , 726 unique peptide sequences . Candidate peptides were submitted to the Pepcentric search engine ( http : / / pepcentric . arsci . com : 8080 / ) for peptide - centric searching against the whole proteome EC dataset . For each peptide , the PSM with the lowest expectation value was selected as a representative and expectation values were converted to p values using a permutation test with twenty million randomly - permuted decoy peptides . TMT channel intensities were extracted from each spectra and intensities were summed across all PSMs associated with a particular candidate peptide sequence for quantitation at the sample level . A very stringent thresholding was performed to minimize the chance of false positive peptide identiﬁcation . First , all peptides with a q - value > 0 . 05 were removed , as were any peptides which had a lower expectation value than the best peptide in the closed ( exact match ) or open ( allowing for one modiﬁcation ) UniProt search . Next , all matches with a TMT intensity below 20 , 000 or lower than 80 % of the max TMT value for that peptide were removed , as these were more likely to be overﬂow from other channels . After that , all peptides with genomic or peptide evidence in more than a third of the dataset were removed , the rationale being that these would not have been rare variants and were therefore likely false positives that should have been classiﬁed as a reference peptide . Finally , all peptides that lacked genomic evidence in any of the samples in which the peptide was found were removed . Although this thresh - olding method is likely to remove many true positives , the objective was to be as certain as possible about the peptides that remained . Quantiﬁcation of Phosphopeptides Phosphopeptide identiﬁcation for the 204 phosphoproteomics data ﬁles were performed as in the global proteome data analysis described above ( e . g . , peptide level FDR < 1 % ) , with an additional dynamic phosphorylation ( + 79 . 9663 Da ) on Ser , Thr , or Tyr res - idues . The phosphoproteome data were further processed by the Ascore algorithm ( Beausoleil et al . , 2006 ) for phosphorylation site localization , and the top - scoring sequences were reported . For phosphoproteomic datasets , the TMT - 10 quantitative data were not summarized by protein , but left at the phosphopeptide level . All peptides ( phosphopeptides and global peptides ) were labeled with TMT - 10 reagent simultaneously . Separation into phospho - and non - phosphopeptides using IMAC was performed after the labeling . Thus , all the biases upstream of labeling are assumed to be identical between global and phosphoproteomics datasets . Therefore , to account for sample - speciﬁc biases in the phosphoproteome analysis , we applied the correction factors derived from median - centering the global proteomic dataset . Quantiﬁcation and Analysis of Acetylated Peptides Acetylated peptide identiﬁcation for the 68 acetylome data ﬁles were performed as in the global proteome data analysis described above , with additional dynamic acetylation ( + 42 . 0105 Da ) and carbamylation ( + 43 . 0058 Da ) on Lys residues . The acetylation site localization , protein inference , and quantiﬁcation of the acetylome data were performed in identical fashion as in the phosphopro - teome data . Theoretically , the IMAC - enriched phosphopeptide sample ( or , less likely , the acetylpeptide sample enriched by IP from the IMAC ﬂow - through ) could still contain the dual - modiﬁed peptides . However , it is currently difﬁcult to use the protein sequence database searching algorithms to identify such peptides , because a rather large number of ‘‘dynamic’’ modiﬁcations need to be considered during the database search ( dynamic phosphorylation on Ser , Thr , or Tyr residues , dynamic acetylation and carbamylation on Lys residues , dynamic oxidation on Met residues , and dynamic deamidation at the N - terminal ) , leading to unreliable estimation of the FDR . As a result , this was not pursued in this study . Histone acetylation values from one functional site but encoded for different histone genes paralogs were averaged . For example , reported peptides HIST1H2BH _ K12 and HIST1H2BD _ K12 were averaged to obtain the acetylation value for the H2B _ K12 site . To test the association between HATs / HDACs protein and acetylation levels of histone sites , we ﬁtted Lasso regression model with HATs / HDACs and histone protein expression as independent variables and a histone acetylation site as a dependent variable . Lasso regression has been chosen because it takes expression of all enzymes into account simultaneously and is insensitive to highly corre - lated dependent variables . We performed 300 bootstraps with 80 % training data and 20 % testing data , and reported averaged coefﬁcients returned by the model across 300 iterations . Differentially acetylated sites between tumor and enriched normal endome - trium samples were found using Wilcoxon rank sum test with at least 6 samples in both groups . The p values were FDR - corrected using the Benjamini - Hochberg procedure . Upregulated sites were deﬁned as ones with FDR - corrected p value < 0 . 05 and median difference > = 0 . 4 , while the corresponding protein change was either not signiﬁcant ( FDR > 0 . 05 ) , or median difference < 0 . 5 . Other Proteogenomic Analyses Phenotype Prediction We used XGBoost ( v0 . 81 ) ( Chen and Guestrin , 2016 ) to develop models for predicting clinical phenotypes using seven types ( muta - tion , copy number alteration , methylation , mRNA abundance , miRNA abundance , protein abundance , and phosphoprotein abun - dance ) of omics data . For each data type , we ﬁrst split the data into training and test ( 80 % / 20 % ) sets . We then tuned the model’s hyperparameters to improve its generalization performance using the training set . For XGBoost , there are two important parameters : the maximum number of nodes allowed from the root to the farthest leaf of a tree , max _ depth and the number of trees in the forest , e10 Cell 180 , 729 – 748 . e1 – e13 , February 20 , 2020 n _ estimators . We used grid search with cross validation to ﬁnd the best parameters , using the area under the receiver operating char - acteristic ( AUROC ) as the evaluation metric . A grid of 4 different n _ estimators values ( 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 ) and 5 different max _ depth values ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 ) was created and each combination was evaluated using 3 - fold cross validation within the training data . Finally , we ﬁt a new model on the whole training set with the parameters that yielded the best cross validation performance . For each data type , we repeated the entire procedure 10 times to capture the performance variation . Mutation Impact on the Proteome and Phosphoproteome We aggregated a set of interacting proteins ( e . g . , kinase / phosphatase - substrate or complex partners ) from Omnipath ( downloaded on 03 / 29 / 18 ) ( Tu¨rei et al . , 2016 ) , DEPOD ( 03 / 29 / 18 ) ( Duan et al . , 2015 ) , CORUM ( downloaded 06 / 29 / 18 ) ( Ruepp et al . , 2008 ) , Signor2 ( 10 / 29 / 18 ) ( Perfetto et al . , 2016 ) , and Reactome ( 11 / 01 / 18 ) ( Fabregat et al . , 2018 ) . We focus our analyses on 18 EC SMGs previously reported in the literature ( ARID1A , CTCF , CTNNB1 , FBXW7 , FLNA , GENE , HUWE1 , INPPL1 , JAK1 , KMT2B , KMT2D , KRAS , MAP3K4 , PIK3CA , PIK3R1 , PTEN , RPL22 , and TP53 ) ( Bailey et al . , 2018 ; Kandoth et al . , 2013 ) . For each interacting protein pair , we split samples with and without mutations in partner A and compare expression levels ( both protein and phosphosites ) both in cis ( partner A ) and in trans ( partner B ) , calculating a median difference in expression and testing for signiﬁcance with the Wilcoxon rank sum tests , with the Benjamini - Hochberg multiple test correction . We further reﬁne the list of trans interactions by ﬁltering proteins that are not part of oncogenic processes identiﬁed in TCGA ( Sanchez - Vega et al . , 2018 ) . Fusion Calls We use three callers to call consensus fusion / chimeric events in our samples ( STAR - Fusion , INTEGRATE , and ericscript ) . Calls by each tool using tumor and normal RNA - Seq data are then merged into a single ﬁle and extensive ﬁltering is done . As STAR - Fusion has higher sensitivity , calls made by this tool with higher supporting evidence ( deﬁned by fusion fragments per million total reads , or FFPM > 0 . 1 ) is required , or a given fusion must be reported by at least 2 callers . We then remove fusions present in our panel of black - listed or normal fusions , which include uncharacterized genes , immunoglobin genes , mitochondrial genes , and others , as well as fu - sions from the same gene or paralog genes ( https : / / www . genenames . org / cgi - bin / statistics ) and fusions reported in TCGA normal samples ( Gao et al . , 2018 ) , GTEx tissues ( reported in STAR - Fusion output ) , and non - cancer cell studies ( Babiceanu et al . , 2016 ) . Finally , we remove normal fusions from the tumor fusions to curate the ﬁnal set . PTMcosmos We gathered 438 , 983 human PTM sites from PTMcosmos ( https : / / ptmcosmos . wustl . edu / ) . PTM sites from PTMcosmos were retrieved from UniProt Knowledge Base ( UniProtKB ) version 2019 . 01 , PhosphoSitePlus ( snapshot on the date 2018 - 02 - 14 ) , and CPTAC phosphorylation and acetylation mass spectrometry data . A PTM site from UniProtKB was included if it was reported in at least one publication or by sequence similarity . A PTM site from PhosphoSitePlus was included if it was reported in at least one publication or validated internally by Cell Signaling Technology . A PTM site from CPTAC experiments was included if it was de - tected in at least one of the samples . We used genome - wide point mutations ( n = 46 , 031 ) and PTMs from the PTMcosmos database ( n = 363 , 670 ) , in order to account for both detected and undetected PTM sites in our cohort . We obtained 5 , 120 ( 11 % of point mutations ) PTM - overlapping mutations : 1 , 083 directly within the PTM site and 4 , 037 within two residues of the PTM site . Inferred Immune , EMT , APM , Wnt Pathway , and miRNA Activity Scores All scores were inferred by single sample gene set enrichment analysis ( ssGSEA ) method from the GSVA R package ( Barbie et al . , 2009 ; Ha¨nzelmann et al . , 2013 ) . The EMT gene signature set is from ( Mak et al . , 2016 ) , immune signatures are from ( Charoentong et al . , 2017 ) , and the KEGG antigen processing and presentation pathway gene set is used as the APM signature . The KEGG Wnt Signaling Pathway gene set was used to analyze the Wnt pathway signatures for our CTNNB1 - mutated and WT tumors . mRNA expression was used to infer EMT and immune scores and protein abundance was used to infer the APM score . Targets of miRNAs were downloaded from the miRNA targets database miRTarBase and only the miRNA / target pairs with strong experimental evidence were retained ( Chou et al . , 2018 ) . miRNA target sets with fewer than 10 genes were removed . The - log2 transformed ssGSEA score was used as the miRNA activity score . TMB and APM Subtyping The value of log2 transformed variants per million bp was used as TMB for the analysis . The k - means algorithm with two centers was applied to TMB and APM Z - score independently . The initial cluster centers were set as the mean values of the top 5 and bottom 5 samples . The classiﬁcation results reported by the k - means algorithm were directly used for tumor subtyping . Differential Proteomic Analysis TMT - based global proteomic , phosphoproteomic , and acetylation data were used to perform pairwise differential analysis between groups of samples . A Wilcoxon rank - sum test was performed to determine differential abundance of proteins and PTMs . At least four samples in both groups were required to have non - missing values and the p value was adjusted using the Benjamini - Hochberg method . For phosphorylation markers in each genomic subtype , the adjusted p value for the protein change was required to be > = 0 . 05 . Over - representation analysis of Wikipathways genesets was performed with the proteins containing the phosphorylation markers . Pathways were considered signiﬁcant with FDR < 0 . 05 . Kinase Activity Analysis Phosphoproteomic data for unique thirteenmer sequence motifs ( ± 6 amino acids from the phosphorylated site ) were combined by median for each sample . Differential abundance was performed as above and thirteenmers were ranked by the signed log p value . Pre - ranked GSEA was performed using WebGestaltR ( Liao et al . , 2019 ) with substrates collected from PhosphoSitePlus , Swiss - Prot , Cell 180 , 729 – 748 . e1 – e13 , February 20 , 2020 e11 and HPRD . A minimum of 10 substrates per kinase was required . Kinases were considered signiﬁcantly differentially active with an FDR < 0 . 05 . Phosphoproteome Outlier Analysis We performed outlier analysis using the BlackSheep package ( Blumenberg et al . , 2019 ) . Brieﬂy , we calculated the median and inter - quartile range ( IQR ) values for each phosphopeptide using TMT - based global phosphoproteomic data . Outliers were deﬁned for each phosphopeptide as any value higher or lower than the median plus or minus 1 . 5x IQR , respectively . Phosphopeptide data was then aggregated into genes by summing outlier and non - outlier values per sample . Outlier counts were used to determine en - riched genes in a group of samples . First , genes without an outlier value in at least 30 % of samples in the group of interest were ﬁltered out . Additionally , genes with a lower average fraction of outlier sites in the group of interest than in the rest of the samples were also ﬁltered out . Then the group of interest was compared to the rest of the samples using a Fisher’s exact test on the sum of outlier and non - outlier values per group . Resulting p values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini - Hoch - berg correction . Druggability was determined for each gene using the drug - gene interaction database ( DGIdb ) ( Cotto et al . , 2018 ) . DNA Damage Response Score Phosphoproteome outlier analysis was used to construct a DNA damage response ( DDR ) score . To isolate well - established phos - phorylation substrates during DNA damage , we focused on genes listed in Table S3 from ( Matsuoka et al . , 2007 ) . These proteins had SQ / TQ sites that were found to be phosphorylated by ATM , ATR or DNAPK in response to DNA damage , and had also been identiﬁed in previous literature as phosphorylation substrates . To calculate the DDR score , we standardized the fraction of phosphosites per gene across samples , and averaged values of this subset of genes per sample . We deﬁned DDR - high samples as all samples with a DDR score more than 1 . 5 IQR above the median DDR score . Cancer / Testis Antigens We downloaded cancer / testis antigens from CTdatabase ( http : / / www . cta . lncc . br ) ( Almeida et al . , 2009 ) . The database consists of 269 cancer - testis antigens with carefully curated and annotated literature - derived information . The CT antigens present in the pro - teomics dataset were selected and z - scores were calculated for each sample compared to the abundance distribution in all normal samples . Tumor samples with a z - score greater than 3 were considered to have high expression of that CT antigen . Only CT antigens with high abundance in at least 10 % of the tumors samples were retained . Variant Peptide Identiﬁcation and Neoantigen Prediction We used NeoFlow ( https : / / github . com / bzhanglab / neoﬂow ) for neoantigen prediction . Speciﬁcally , Optitype ( Szolek et al . , 2014 ) was used to ﬁnd human leukocyte antigens ( HLA ) in the WXS data . Then we used netMHCpan ( Jurtz et al . , 2017 ) to predict HLA peptide binding afﬁnity for somatic mutation – derived variant peptides with a length between 8 - 11 amino acids . The cutoff of IC 50 binding af - ﬁnity was set to 150 nM . HLA peptides with binding afﬁnity higher than 150 nM were removed . Variant identiﬁcation was also per - formed at both mRNA and protein levels using RNA - Seq data and MS / MS data , respectively . To identify variant peptides , we used a customized protein sequence database approach ( Wang et al . , 2012 ) . We derived customized protein sequence databases from matched WXS data and then performed database searching using the customized databases for individual TMT experiments . We built a customized database for each TMT experiment based on somatic variants from WXS data . We used Customprodbj ( https : / / github . com / bzhanglab / customprodbj ) for customized database construction . MS - GF + was used for variant peptide identi - ﬁcation for all global proteome , phosphorylation and acetylation data . Results from MS - GF + were ﬁltered with 1 % FDR at PSM level . Remaining variant peptides were further ﬁltered using PepQuery ( http : / / www . pepquery . org ) ( Wen et al . , 2019 ) with the p value cutoff % 0 . 01 . The spectra of variant peptides were annotated using PDV ( http : / / www . zhang - lab . org / ) ( Li et al . , 2019 ) and the anno - tated spectra are shown in Table S7 . mRNA and Protein and Protein and Phosphoprotein Correlation To compare mRNA expression and protein abundance across samples we focused on the 9575 genes with RNA - Seq based RSEM measurement and proteomics data . The analyses were carried out on normalized data where RSEM count data was upper - quartile normalized , while proteomics data was quantile normalized . Correlation was performed by Spearman’s correlation method . Both correlation coefﬁcient and p value were computed . Furthermore , p values were adjusted by the Benjamini – Hochberg procedure . The same procedure of mRNA - protein correlation was applied to protein - phospho cis pairs . Sorted Spearman’s correlation coefﬁ - cients were further used for ssGSEA analysis with default settings . SCNA Cis and Trans Effect Identiﬁcation The correlations between copy number ( gene level ) , RNA expression , and protein expression were performed using Spearman’s rank correlation for 9377 genes with quantiﬁed data from all three platforms . We deﬁned the SCNA cis effect as the signiﬁcant association ( FDR < 0 . 01 , Spearman’s rank test ) between a given copy number and the gene expression at both protein and RNA levels from the same genome loci , and the SCNA trans effect as the signiﬁcant association ( FDR < 0 . 01 , Spearman’s rank test ) between a given locus and global gene expression ( Zhang et al . , 2014 ) . Anti - p53 Pathway Driver Gene Prioritization The p53 pathway activity was inferred from known p53 transcription targets ( MSigDB INGA _ TP53 _ TARGETS , ( Inga et al . , 2002 ) ) us - ing ssGSEA ( Barbie et al . , 2009 ) implemented in the R package GSVA ( Ha¨nzelmann et al . , 2013 ) . In order to prioritize the genes whose protein expression is associated with p53 pathway activity , we used the following linear regression : p53 _ pathway _ score = b 1 X I ð TP53 mutation Þ + b 2 X ProExprs e12 Cell 180 , 729 – 748 . e1 – e13 , February 20 , 2020 Where the I ( TP53 mutation ) denotes the indicator function ( 1 if TP53 is mutated or 0 if TP53 is wild type ) , and ProExprs denotes the protein expression of the given gene . The association between protein expression and p53 activity was ranked based on the statistical signiﬁcance of b 2 . Furthermore , to summarize whether a given gene set ( e . g . , all qualiﬁed genes in 1q ) was signiﬁcantly associated with p53 activity , the ranking metric derived above for all the genes and the gene set was tested using the GSEA method implemented in the R package fgsea ( Sergushichev , 2016 ) .

Integrated Proteomics Workﬂow and Longitudinal Data Generation Quality Control , Related to STAR Methods ( A ) TMT - 10 based global proteome , phosphoproteome , and acetylome analysis workﬂow . The EC tumors and normal tissues were analyzed in 17 TMT 10 - plex experiments , each with 9 study samples and a common internal reference sample created by pooling all study samples ( equal contribution ) .
