Here we show that the mammalian cytosolic and nuclear chap - erone Hsc70 can act as both , as a ' holding 1 and a ' fold - ing ' system , depending on the chaperone cofactors which associate with Hsc70 . In conjunction with the cofactor Hsp40 , Hsc70 stabilizes heat - denatured fire - fly luciferase . The stabilizing activity turns into a fold - ing activity in the additional presence of the Hsc70 - in - teracting protein Hip . In contrast , the cofactor BAG - 1 abrogates the ' holding ' function of the Hsc70 / Hsp40 system and blocks the action of Hip on Hsc70 . Our study sheds light on the molecular mechanisms that determine the functional specificity of Hsc70 in the mammalian cell . Key words : ATPase cycle / Hdj - 1 / Hsp70 / RAP46 / Refolding . Introduction The cytosolic and nuclear heat shock cognate Hsc70 pro - tein participates in a wide range of cellular processes in mammals . Hsc70 is involved in the folding and assembly of newly synthesized proteins , the refolding of nonnative proteins following cellular stress , the sorting of proteins to different subcellular compartments , and the regulation of signal transduction pathways ( Craig et a / . , 1994 ; Hartl , 1996 ; Frydman and Höhfeld , 1997 ; Johnson and Craig , 1997 ) . Yet , how functional specificity of Hsc70 is achieved during these processes remains an enigma . In recent years , several cofactors have been identified which associate and cooperate with Hsc70 , defining the mammalian Hsc70 chaperone system ( Hartl , 1996 ; Prapa - panich et a / . , 1996 ; Höhfeld ei a / . , 1995 ; Höhfeld and Jentsch , 1997 ; Takayamaef a / . , 1997 ; Zeineref a / . , 1997 ; Michels ei a / . , 1997 ; Demand et a / . , 1998 ) . Association with cofactors is essential for the regulation of the ATPase cycle of Hsc70 , altering the affinity of the chaperone for nonnative polypeptide substrates . While Hsc70 in the ATP - bound conformation rapidly binds and releases a polypeptide substrate , stable substrate binding depends on the transfer of the chaperone to the ADP - bound state ( Hartl , 1996 ; Rüdiger ei a / . , 1997 ) . ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 is stimulated by cofactors of the Hsp40 protein family , such as Hsp40 ( Hdj - 1 ) , Hdj - 2 , and auxilin ( Freeman efa / . , 1995 ; Minamieia / . , 1996 ; Hartl , 1996 ; Holstein ef a / . , 1996 ; Terada et a / . , 1997 ) . Hsp40 is thus required for effi - cient substrate recognition by Hsc70 ( Freeman ef a / . , 1995 ; Minami efa / . , 1996 ) . Remarkably , the ADP - bound state of Hsc70 , generated through an interaction with Hsp40 , is affected by the Hsc70 cofactors Hip and BAG - 1 in opposite ways ( Höhfeld , 1998 ) . Hip slows down the re - lease of ADP from Hsc70 and may therefore stabilize an Hsc70 / substrate complex ( Höhfeld efa / . , 1995 ; Höhfeld and Jentsch , 1997 ) . In contrast , BAG - 1 accelerates ADP - release from the chaperone protein and thus strongly stimulates Hsc70 ' s ATPase activity in conjunction with Hsp40 ( Höhfeld and Jentsch , 1997 ) . Intriguingly , Hip and BAG - 1 both bind to the ATPase domain of Hsc70 in a mutually exclusive manner ( Höhfeld and Jentsch , 1997 ) . Hence , Hip and BAG - 1 represent competing Hsc70 co - factors that conversely affect the ADP - bound state of the chaperone protein . Here we describe the effects of Hsp40 , Hip , and BAG - 1 on protein folding mediated by Hsc70 . While Hsc70 in conjunction with Hsp40 stabilizes heat - denatured firefly luciferase , acting as a ' holding ' system , efficient refolding occurs in the additional presence of Hip , turning the ' hold - ing ' system into a ' folding ' system . On the other hand , BAG - 1 induces the release of the Hsc70 - bound polypep - tide and prevents Hip - mediated regulation of Hsc70 . The competing cofactors Hip and BAG - 1 thus directly deter - mine the fate of a nonnative polypeptide stabilized by Hsc70 and Hsp40 . The presented data reveal on a molec - ular level how functional specificity of Hsc70 in the mam - malian cell can be induced through the action of chaper - one cofactors . Results Hip Promotes the Chaperone - Mediated Refolding of Heat - Denatured Luciferase An in vitro assay to analyze the function of Hsc70 and its cofactors during the refolding of heat - denatured proteins has recently been established ( Minami efa / . , 1996 ) . In this assay , firefly luciferase , thermally denatured in the pres - ence of Hsc70 , Hsp40 , and ATP , can be efficiently refolded 1218 J . L dersefa / . upon addition of rabbit reticulocyte lysate . By employing this assay , we analyzed the role of the Hsc70 - interacting protein Hip in the chaperone - mediated refolding process . While Hip was previously shown to promote the Hsc70 / Hsp40 - mediated folding of chemically denatured luci - ferase ( H hfeld ef a / . , 1995 ) , it was unclear whether the co - factor similarly affects the refolding of heat - denatured lu - ciferase . When luciferase was thermally denatured in the presence of Hsc70 and Hsp40 ( at a molar ratio of both pro - teins of 3 : 2 , as calculated for monomeric forms ) , efficient refolding occurred upon subsequent incubation at 30 °C in the presence of 2 . 5 % rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( Figure 1 A ) . In contrast , denaturation of luciferase in the presence of Hsc70 and a two - fold molar excess of Hip oligomer over the chaperone did not allow efficient refolding . Apparent - ly , Hip is not able to substitute for Hsp40 in this assay , con - sistent with the distinct regulatory functions of the two Hsc70 cofactors ( Frydman and H hfeld , 1997 ; H hfeld and Jentsch , 1997 ) . On the other hand , the presence of Hip in an Hsc70 and Hsp40 containing reaction ( ratio of Hsc70 to Hsp40 of 3 : 2 ) led to a slight increase ( - 20 % ) in the amount of refolded luciferase following addition of reticulocyte lysate . The stimulating function of Hip be - came even more apparent when the concentration of Hsp40 was reduced in the folding assay . Following denat - uration of luciferase in the presence of Hsc70 and Hsp40 at a molar ratio of 3 : 0 . 8 , only about 40 % of the luciferase activity was recovered in the refolding reaction , whereas the amount of enzymatically active luciferase was in - creased to ~ 80 % when Hip was also present ( Figure 1B ) . Addition of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) instead of Hip led only to a minor increase in the amount of refolded lu - ciferase ( to about 45 % ) , demonstrating the specificity of Hip ' s activity in the refolding assay . These results might explain why Hip was not found to promote the refolding of heat - denatured luciferase in a previous study , where con - 70 + 40 > RL 70 + 40 + Hip > RL 70 + 40 + BSA > RL 70 > RL 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 time ( min ) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 time ( min ) 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 Hsp40 concentration ( μΜ ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 Hip concentration ( μΜ ) Fig . 1 Hip Promotes the Refolding of Heat - Denatured Luciferase Mediated by Hsc70 and Hsp40 in the Presence of Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate . ( A ) Luciferase was heat - denatured at 42 °C in the presence of Hsc70 ( 70 ) , Hsp40 ( 40 ) , Hip , and BSA as indicated , and refolding was per - formed at 30 °C in the presence of 2 . 5 % rabbit reticulocyte lysate . Concentration of purified proteins during refolding were as follows : 3 μΜ of Hsc70 , 2 μΜ of Hsp40 , 6 μΜ of Hip oligomer , and 6 μΜ of BSA . ' RL ' indicates addition of rabbit reticulocyte lysate after heat de - naturation . ( B ) Effect of Hip on luciferase refolding at a substoichiometric concentration of Hsp40 over Hsc70 . Refolding assays were performed as described under ( A ) except for the presence of a reduced amount of Hsp40 ( 0 . 8 μΜ ) . ( C ) Dependence of the refolding - pro - moting activity of Hip on the concentration of Hsp40 . Refolding assays were performed as described under ( A ) in the presence of different concentrations of Hsp40 . Values obtained for luciferase activity at 30 and 60 min of refolding in the presence of 6 μΜ Hip oligomer were av - eraged and divided by activity values from control reactions lacking Hip . ( D ) Titration of Hip in refolding assays containing 3 μΜ of Hsc70 and 0 . 8 μΜ of Hsp40 . Cofactor - Modulated Functions of Hsc70 1219 centrations of Hsp40 were close to those of HscZO ( Ge - bauer ei a / . , 1997 ) . Titration of Hsp40 further revealed that Hip stimulates the chaperone - mediated refolding of heat - denatured luciferase in particular at substoichiometric concentrations of Hsp40 over Hsc70 , with a 2 . 3 - fold stim - ulation observed at a ratio of Hsc70 to Hsp40 of 10 : 1 ( Fig - ure 1C ) . Half maximal stimulation of the refolding activity by Hip was already obtained at a molar ratio of Hsc70 to Hip oligomer of about 3 : 1 ( Figure 1D ) . Notably , the con - centration of Hsp40 in rabbit reticulocyte lysate is signifi - cantly lower than the concentration of Hsc70 , whereas Hip and Hsc70 are about equally abundant ( Terada et a / . , 1997 ; Prapapanich et a / . , 1998 ) . Thus , the experimental conditions that reveal a pronounced effect of Hip on the refolding of heat - denatured luciferase are close to the physiological situation . Hip Can Substitute for Reticulocyte Lysate in the Refolding Assay It has been noted previously that the requirement for rab - bit reticulocyte lysate in the refolding assay might reflect the presence of additional chaperones or chaperone co - factors in the lysate which cooperate with Hsc70 and Hsp40 during the refolding process ( Minami etal . , 1996 ) . Since Hip was a likely candidate for such a cofactor , we in - vestigated whether Hip can substitute for reticulocyte lysate in the refolding assay . Luciferase was thermally de - natured in the presence of Hsc70 and Hsp40 ( ratio 3 : 2 ) followed by incubation under refolding conditions in the presence of either reticulocyte lysate , different concentra - tions of Hip , or BSA ( Figure 2 ) . While incubation in the presence of 6 μΜ BSA did not allow efficient refolding of lu - ciferase , refolding in the presence of 6μΜ Hip oligomer - 70 + 40 > RL - 70 + 40 > 6μΜΗίρ - 70 + 40 > 3μΜΗίρ - 70 + 40 > 1 . 5μΜΗίρ - 70 + 40 > 6μΜΒ8Α 10 20 30 40 50 60 time ( min ) Fig . 2 In the Absence of Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate , Hip Is Re - quired for the Refolding of Luciferase Heat - Denatured in the Pres - ence of Hsc70 ( 70 ) and Hsp40 ( 40 ) . Concentrations of purified Hsc70 and Hsp40 during refolding were 3 μΜ and 2 μΜ , respectively . ' RU indicates addition of rabbit reticulocyte lysate after heat - denaturation to a final concentration of 2 . 5 % . In separate reactions , Hip and BSA were added at the in - dicated concentrations after heat denaturation . yielded about 80 % native luciferase and was thus similar - ly efficient as refolding observed after addition of reticulo - cyte lysate . Hip can apparently substitute for lysate in the refolding reaction . Most importantly , in the absence of lysate Hsc70 / Hsp40 - mediated refolding of luciferase was dependent on the presence of Hip ( Figure 2 ) . The data es - tablish Hip as a vital component of the mammalian Hsc70 chaperone system . It has to be pointed out , however , that the amount of pu - rified Hip added to the refolding reactions exceeded the amount of Hip present in the added lysate . This argues for yet additional proteins in the lysate that participate in the refolding process , such as the Hsc70 / Hsp90 - organizing protein Hop and Hsp90 ( Schneider ef a / . , 1996 ; Thulasira - 100 - 1 - 70 + 40 > RL - 70 + 40 + 1 . 5 μΜ BAG > RL - 70 + 40 + 3 . 0 μΜ BAG > RL - 70 + 40 + 6 . 0 μΜ BAG > RL - 70 > RL 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 time ( min ) B 100η - 70 + 40 > Hip - 70 + 40 > buffer - 70 + 40 + 12 μΜ BAG > buffer - 70 + 40 + 1 μΜ BAG > Hip - 70 + 40 + 3 μΜ BAG > Hip - 70 + 40 + 6 μΜ BAG > Hip - 70 + 40 + 12 μΜ BAG > Hip 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 time ( min ) Fig . 3 Presence of BAG - 1 during Heat Denaturation Inhibits Lu - ciferase Refolding Induced by Subsequent Addition of Reticulo - cyte Lysate and Hip , Respectively . ( A ) Luciferase was heat denatured in the presence of Hsc70 ( 70 ) , Hsp40 ( 40 ) and different concentrations of BAG - 1 , and refolding was analyzed following addition of reticulocyte lysate ( RL ) . Con - centrations of purified Hsc70 and Hsp40 during refolding were 3 μΜ and 2 μΜ , respectively . ( B ) Refolding assays were performed as described under ( A ) except for the addition of 6μΜ of Hip oligomer where indicated . Values represent the mean from two in - dependent experiments . 1220 J . L ders ei a / . man and Matts , 1996 ; Schumacher et a / . , 1996 ; Johnson et a / . , 1998 ) . In fact , at reduced concentrations of Hip fur - ther addition of Hop and Hsp90 increased the amount of reactivated luciferase ( data not shown ) . BAG - 1 Inhibits the Refolding of Heat - Denatured Luciferase and Blocks the Action of Hip The anti - apoptotic protein BAG - 1 was recently identified as a binding partner of Hsc70 ( Takayama et a / . , 1997 ; Zeiner et a / . , 1997 ) , and was shown to be involved in the regulation of the ATPase cycle of the chaperone protein ( H hfeld and Jentsch , 1997 ) . When luciferase was heat - denatured in the presence of Hsc70 , Hsp40 , and BAG - 1 , subsequent refolding of luciferase in the presence of retic - ulocyte lysate was significantly impaired ( Figure 3A ) . Moreover , when refolding was initiated by addition of Hip instead of reticulocyte lysate a two - fold molar excess of BAG - 1 over Hip completely blocked luciferase reactiva - tion ( Figure 3B ) . Apparently , BAG - 1 inhibits the chaperone activity of the Hsc70 / Hsp40 system and blocks the action of Hip . We also investigated the influence of BAG - 1 on lu - ciferase refolding when added after heat treatment . Fol - lowing denaturation of luciferase in the presence of Hsc70 and Hsp40 , subsequent addition of BAG - 1 led to an initial burst of luciferase activity under refolding conditions ( Fig - ure 4A ) . About 30 % of the denatured protein reached the native state within 5 min of incubation at 30 °C when BAG - 1 was present . However , at later time points BAG - 1 no longer promoted luciferase refolding . Between 5 and 60 min of refolding only about 15 % of the heat - denatured lu - ciferase reached the native state , which was comparable to the increase in activity during this time period in the presence of Hsc70 and Hsp40 alone ( Figure 4A and B ) . Re - markably , the BAG - 1 induced initial burst of luciferase ac - tivity was also observed when the ATPase cycle of Hsc70 was inhibited by EDTA ( Figure 4C ) . It appears that a certain portion of Hsc70 - associated luciferase can advance to the native state in a single release event triggered by BAG - 1 under these experimental conditions . In contrast , Hip - induced refolding was EDTA - sensitive , indicating that luciferase reactivation mediated by the Hsc70 / Hsp40 / Hip system requires multiple cycles of binding and release of the nonnative substrate . When refolding was initiated by addition of both BAG - 1 and Hip , again an initial burst of luciferase actitvity was observed during the first 5 min of refolding . However , in - creasing concentrations of BAG - 1 impaired luciferase re - folding that was stimulated by Hip at later time points , i . e . between 5 and 60 min of the refolding process ( Figure 4A and B ) . Apparently , BAG - 1 blocks the activity of Hip in the refolding process that is dependent on multiple binding and release cycles . The Hip - counteracting activity of BAG - 1 is probably caused by the competition of the two cofactors for interaction with the ATPase domain of Hsc70 ( H hfeld and Jentsch , 1997 ) . - 70 + 40 > buffer - 70 + 40 > Hip - 70 + 40 > 24 μΜ BAG - 70 + 40 > Ηίρ + 3μΜ BAG - 70 + 40 > Hip + 12uMBAG - 70 + 40 > Ηίρ + 18μΜΒΑ6 - 70 + 40 > Ηίρ + 24μΜ BAG 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 time ( min ) Hip + ' + BAG - 1 ( μΜ ) - 3 12 18 24 24 - 70 + 40 > buffer - 70 + 40 > buffer / EDTA - 70 + 40 > Hip - 70 + 40 > Hip / EDTA - 70 + 40 > BAG - 70 + 40 > BAG / EDTA 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 time ( min ) Fig . 4 Effects of Hip and Different Concentrations of BAG - 1 on the Refolding of Luciferase Heat - Denatured in the Presence of Hsc70 ( 70 ) and Hsp40 ( 40 ) . ( A ) BAG - 1 induces an initial burst of luciferase activity , but inhibits Hip - stimulated refolding at later time points . Concentrations of purified proteins during refolding were as follows : 3 μΜ of Hsc70 , 2 μΜ of Hsp40 , and 6 μΜ of Hip oligomer . Values were averaged from two independent experiments . ( B ) BAG - 1 blocks luciferase refolding induced by Hip between 5 and 60 min after initiation of the refolding process in a concentration - dependent manner . Val - ues represent the percentage of total luciferase that was refolded between 5 and 60 min of incubation under refolding conditions as determined in ( A ) . ( C ) The BAG - 1 - induced initial burst of luciferase activity is also detectable in the presence of EDTA , whereas Hip - stimulated refolding is inhibited by the chelating agent . Experiments were performed as described under ( A ) , ex - cept for the addition of 10 ITIM EDTA when indicated after heat treatment . Cofactor - Modulated Functions of Hsc70 1221 Hip and BAG - 1 Conversely Affect the Hsc70 / Hsp40 - Mediated Stabilization of Luciferase during Thermal Denaturation To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that under - lie the distinct activities of Hip and BAG - 1 we analyzed the effects of the two cofactors on the stabilization of lu - ciferase during thermal denaturation . To this end , lu - ciferase was heat - denatured alone or in the presence of 100 Fig . 5 Effects of Hsc70 and Hsc70 Cofactors on the Stability of Luciferase during Heat Treatment . Luciferase was treated at 42 °C in the presence of 3 μΜ of Hsc70 , 2 μΜ of Hsp40 , 3 μΜ of Hip oligomer , 3 μΜ of BAG - 1 , and 3 μΜ of BSA as indicated . The amount of aggregated luciferase was assessed after centrifugation at 100000 g . The total amount of luciferase in the supernatant and pellet was set to 100 % . Given values were averaged from three independent experiments . different combinations of Hsc70 and individual cofactors , followed by the removal of insoluble protein aggregates by centrifugation . In the absence of Hsc70 or cofactors , lu - ciferase quantitatively aggregated , and thus > 95 % of the protein was recovered in the pellet fraction after centrifu - gation ( Figure 5 ) . Denaturation in the presence of Hsc70 led to a partial stabilization of luciferase , resulting in a de - crease in the amount of aggregated protein to about 55 % . Hsp40 alone was unable to stabilize luciferase during heat denaturation . However , the cofactor enhanced the stabi - lizing function of Hsc70 , reducing the amount of aggregat - ed luciferase to about 30 % of total protein . This is in agree - ment with the essential function of Hsp40 for the efficient binding of Hsc70 to polypeptidesubstrates ( Minami ef a / . , 1996 ) . Intriguingly , addition of Hip to an Hsc70 / Hsp40 containing reaction led to a further stabilization of lu - ciferase . Under these conditions only about 5 % of the heat - treated luciferase formed insoluble protein aggre - gates ( Figure 5 ) . An opposite effect was observed upon addition of BAG - 1 . Compared with a reaction containing Hsc70 and Hsp40 alone , the amount of aggregated lu - ciferase was increased in the presence of BAG - 1 . The data thus reveal opposing effects of Hip and BAG - 1 on the Hsc70 / Hsp40 - mediated stabilization of luciferase during thermal denaturation . Notably , BAG - 1 and Hip alone , but not Hsp40 or BSA , were able to prevent the aggregation of heat - denatured luciferase to a certain extent ( Figure 5 ) , suggesting an at least transient association of both cofactors with unfolded luciferase molecules . In the case of BAG - 1 , however , this putative association did not promote the recovery of na - tive protein in refolding assays containing Hsc70 and Hsp40 ( Figure 3 , see above ) .

To further investigate the effects of the distinct HscTO cofactors on the formation and stability of Hsc70 / luci - ferase complexes we performed gel filtration chromatog - raphy . Following thermal denaturation of luciferase in the presence of Hsc70 and different cofactors and subse - quent removal of protein aggregates by centrif ugation , the soluble fraction was analyzed on a Superose 12 gel filtra - tion column . When luciferase was incubated at 42 °C in the presence of Hsc70 and ATP , no stable Hsc70 / substrate complex was formed ( Figure 6 ) . While luciferase eluted as a monomer in fractions 14 to 16 , Hsc70 appeared to elute largely in a dimeric form with a peak in fraction 11 . In con - trast , after heat treatment of luciferase in the presence of Hsc70 and Hsp40 , luciferase was mainly detected in a high molecular mass complex of about 700 kDa together with Hsc70 ( Figure 6 ) . The size of the complex might indi - cate the association of multiple Hsc70 proteins with one molecule of nonnative luciferase . However , oligomeriza - tion of Hsc70 has to be considered as an additional possi - ble cause for the formation of the high molecular mass complex ( Miao etal . , 1997 ) . In fact , after heat treatment of Hsc70 together with Hsp40 , but in the absence of lu - ciferase , a portion of Hsc70 was already detectable in 300 and 700 kDa complexes , respectively , suggesting oligo - merization of the chaperone ( Figure 6 ) . Intriguingly , the 700 kDa Hsc70 / luciferase complex was not observed when BAG - 1 was present during thermal denaturation of luciferase . In this situation , a minor portion of luciferase eluted as a 250 kDa complex , apparently in association with Hsc70 and BAG - 1 , while the majority of the protein was uncomplexed ( Figure 6 ) . It appears that BAG - 1 re - duces the stability of an Hsc70 / luciferase complex . In the presence of Hip the 700 kDa chaperone / substrate com - plex was only partially dissociated and , in addition , a 350 kDa complex was formed that contained Hip , Hsc70 and luciferase . Apparently , Hip and BAG - 1 affect Hsc70 / sub - strate complexes in distinct ways , explaining the oppos - ing effects of both cofactors on the chaperone - mediated stabilization of luciferase during thermal denaturation ( see above ) . A Polypeptide Substrate Modulates the ATPase Activity of Hsc70 in the Presence of BAG - 1 It was conceivable that BAG - 1 blocks the interaction of Hsc70 with a nonnative polypeptide substrate . We there - fore investigated whether a polypeptide substrate modu - lates the ATPase activity of Hsc70 when BAG - 1 is associ - ated with the chaperone protein . Due to its own ATP - hy - drolytic activity these experiments could not be per - formed using firefly luciferase as a substrate . Instead , the anti - microbial polypeptide preprocecropin A of Hyalopho - ra cecropia was used , which is posttranslationally import - ed into dog pancreas microsomes in a process apparent - ly dependent on Hsc70 ( Schlenstedt et a / . , 1990 ; Klappa etal . , 1991 ) . Preprocecropin A ( ppcec ) stimulated the AT - Fig . 7 Effects of Polypeptide Substrate and Cofactors on the ATPase Activity of Hsc70 . ( A ) By acting as a polypeptide substrate preprocecropin A stimu - lates the basal rate of ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 in the presence of BAG - 1 . Hsc70 ( 3μΜ ) was incubated with 150μΜ of preproce - cropin A and 6 μΜ of BAG - 1 as indicated and ATPase activity was determined in two independent experiments . ( B ) Preprocecropin A partially counteracts the ATPase - stimulating activity of BAG - 1 displayed in conjunction with Hsp40 . ATPase activity of Hsc70 ( 3 μΜ ) was analyzed in the presence of preprocecropin ( 150 μΜ ) , Hsp40 ( 6 μΜ ) , and BAG - 1 ( 6 μΜ ) as indicated . Values were aver - aged from two independent experiments . ( C ) The carboxy - termi - nal domain of BAG - 1 ( c - BAG , amino acids 129 - 264 of human BAG - 1 ) is sufficient for regulation of Hsc70 . Similar to BAG - 1 ( 6μΜ ) , c - BAG ( 6μΜ ) stimulated the ATPase activity of Hsc70 ( 3 μΜ ) in conjunction with Hsp40 ( 6 μΜ ) . Given values represent the mean of at least two independent experiments . Cofactor - Modulated Functions of Hsc70 1223 Pase activity of Hsc70 2 . 2 - fold at a 50 - fold molar excess over Hsc70 ( Figure 7A ) . A substrate - induced stimulation of the ATPase activity of Hsc70 was also observed in the presence of BAG - 1 ( Figure 7A ) , indicating that ppcec is recognized as a substrate by Hsc70 when the chaperone cooperates with the cofactor . This was further confirmed in experiments in which Hsp40 was included . In these experiments Hsp40 alone stimulated the Hsc70 ATPase activity about 5 . 5 - fold ( Figure 7B ) . Further addition of ppcec led to an additional stimulation of the ATPase activ - ity that was comparable to the stimulation of the basal hydrolysis rate of Hsc70 by ppcec . Apparently , polypep - tide substrate and Hsp40 together accelerate the ATPase cycle of Hsc70 in an additive manner . In contrast , BAG - 1 and Hsp40 acted synergistically in the regulation of Hsc70 ' s ATPase activity . While BAG - 1 alone was not able to accelerate the basal rate of ATP hydrolysis by the chap - erone , the cofactor triggered a strong overstimulation of the ATPase cycle of Hsc70 in conjunction with Hsp40 ( Fig - ure 7B ) . Intriguingly , the BAG - 1 effect in the presence of Hsp40 was partially compensated when ppcec was pre - sent during the incubation . Interaction of Hsc70 with the polypeptide substrate apparently counteracted in part the stimulation of ADP - release induced by BAG - 1 . Again , the data demonstrate the capacity of Hsc70 to bind a polypeptide substrate while the chaperone cooperates with BAG - 1 . The Carboxy - Terminal Domain of BAG - 1 Is Sufficient for Hsc70 Regulation It was recently reported that several isoforms of the BAG - 1 protein exist in the mammalian cell ( Packham ef a / . , 1997 ) . Due to the use of different translational initiation sites , isoforms with distinct amino - termini apparently arise . We therefore investigated whether a carboxy - termi - nal fragment of BAG - 1 ( c - BAG , amino acids 129 - 274 of human BAG - 1 / RAP46 ) is sufficient for the regulation of Hsc70 . Similar to the 46 kDa human BAG - 1 isoform used in the experiments described above , c - BAG strongly stim - ulated the ATPase activity of Hsc70 in conjunction with Hsp40 ( Figure 7C ) and impaired luciferase refolding medi - ated by Hsc70 in conjunction with Hsp40 and Hip ( data not shown ) . This is in agreement with a previous study showing that a carboxy - terminal fragment of murine BAG - 1 , similar to human c - BAG , was sufficient to inhibit the chaperone function of Hsc70 and Hsp40 during the refold - ing of chemically denatured ß - galactosidase ( Takayama ef a / . , 1997 ) . Apparently , the amino - terminal region and a ubiquitin - like domain of human and murine BAG - 1 are not essential for the regulatory function of the chaperone co - factor . This suggests that regulation of Hsc70 is a common function of the distinct BAG - 1 isoforms . Discussion The chaperone cofactors Hip and BAG - 1 were recently shown to regulate the ATPase cycle of Hsc70 which is ' holding 1 Hsc70 ' release 1 Fig . 8 Cofactor - lnduced Modulation of the Function of Hsc70 in the Stabilization and Refolding of Thermally Denatured Lu - ciferase . The ATP - bound state of Hsc70 is characterized by the rapid as - sociation and dissociation of unfolded polypeptide ( U ) or folding intermediates ( I ) . Hsp40 stimulates transfer of Hsc70 to the ADP - bound state , resulting in more stable substrate binding . Hsc70 and Hsp40 together stabilize thermally denatured luciferase but do not promote efficient luciferase refolding ( ' holding ' ) . In the ad - ditional presence of Hip , refolding of luciferase occurs ( ' folding ' ) . On the other hand , BAG - 1 appears to stimulate the release of lu - ciferase molecules from Hsc70 / Hsp40 independent of the folding state of the molecules ( ' release ' ) . Under certain experimental conditions a portion of the released luciferase appears to be able to advance to the native state ( N ) . coupled to cycles of binding and release of a nonnative polypeptide substrate ( Höhfeld and Jentsch , 1997 ; Höh - feld , 1998 ) ( Figure 8 ) . Following an initial stimulation of Hsc70 ' s ATPase activity by Hsp40 , Hip associates with Hsc70 and transiently stabilizes the ADP - bound state of the chaperone ( Höhfeld ef a / . , 1995 ; Irmer and Höhfeld , 1997 ; Höhfeld and Jentsch , 1997 ) . Notably , Hsc70 most stably interacts with a polypeptide substrate when in the ADP - bound conformation ( Rüdiger ef a / . , 1997 ) . It was therefore speculated that the regulatory function of Hip promotes Hsc70 / substrate interaction ( Frydman and Höhfeld , 1997 ; Johnson and Craig , 1997 ) . Consistent with this hypothesis , Hip , in conjunction with Hsc70 and Hsp40 , significantly reduced the amount of aggregated luciferase during thermal denaturation ( Figure 5 ) , and an Hsc70 / Hip / luciferase complex was formed ( Figure 6 ) . The stability of the resulting complex may be increased through direct binding of Hip to associated luciferase mol - ecules , since Hip alone was able to prevent luciferase ag - gregation during heat denaturation to a significant extent ( Figure 5 ) . Remarkably , Hip was absolutely required for the efficient refolding of luciferase after heat denaturation in the presence of Hsc70 and Hsp40 . The EDTA - sensitivity of the Hip - induced refolding process and the kinetics of re - folding indicate that nonnative luciferase has to interact with the chaperone system in multiple binding and release cycles to attain its native conformation ( Figure 4 ) . This is consistent with previous observations regarding the re - folding of luciferase mediated by bacterial Hsp70 and its cofactors ( Schröder ef a / . , 1993 ; Szabo ef a / . , 1994 ) . The transient stabilization of nonnative polypeptides mediat - ed by the observed Hsc70 / Hip complex in each reaction cycle appears to provide the basis for the productive fold - 1224 J . Lüders et a / . ing of heat - denatured luciferase ( Figure 8 ) . Hsc70 , Hsp40 , and Hip may thus constitute a folding machinery in the mammalian cytosol , in addition to the previously de - scribed Hsc70 / Hdj - 2 system ( Terada et a / . , 1997 ) . The Hip - comprising machinery may be of particular relevance for the regulation of signal transduction pathways ( Fryd - man and Höhfeld , 1997 ) . Hip was recently found associat - ed with protein kinases and steroid hormone receptors which require Hsc70 and Hsp90 for activation ( Höhfeld ei a / . , 1995 ; Prapapanich ef a / . , 1996 ) , and a dominant in - hibitory form of Hip blocked the activation pathway of progesterone receptor ( Prapapanich ef a / . , 1998 ) . In contrast to Hip , BAG - 1 stimulates the release of ADP from Hsc70 . In conjunction with Hsp40 , BAG - 1 thus strongly accelerates the Hsc70 reaction cycle ( Höhfeld and Jentsch , 1997 ) ( Figure 7 ) . Remarkably , Hsc70 / Hsp40 - mediated stabilization of luciferase during thermal inacti - vation was significantly impaired in the presence of BAG - 1 , resulting in an increased amount of aggregated lu - ciferase ( Figure 5 ) . Moreover , subsequent refolding of lu - ciferase induced by addition of Hip or rabbit reticulocyte lysate was completely blocked when denaturation was performed in the presence of BAG - 1 ( Figure 3 ) . BAG - 1 apparently interferes with the chaperone activity of the Hsc70 system . This is consistent with previous observa - tions on the function of BAG - 1 in Hsc70 - mediated folding ( Zeineref a / . , 1997 ; Gebauer ef a / . , 1997 ) . Furthermore , de - natured ß - galactosidase can be refolded by Hsc70 and Hsp40 ( Freeman and Morimoto , 1996 ; Takayama ef a / . , 1997 ) , but refolding is inhibited in the presence of BAG - 1 ( Takayama ef a / . , 1997 ) . Conceivably , accelerated cycling of Hsc70 between different nucleotide states in the pres - ence of Hsp40 and BAG - 1 may prevent an interaction of the chaperone with nonnative polypeptide substrates . However , ternary complexes of Hsc70 , BAG - 1 , and asso - ciated substrates have been observed ( Takayama ef a / . , 1997 ; Zeineref a / . , 1997 ) . Furthermore , a transient associ - ation of polypeptide substrate with Hsc70 in the presence of BAG - 1 is indicated by the observed effects of preproce - cropin A on the ATPase activity of Hsc70 cooperating with BAG - 1 ( Figure 7 ) . Thus , BAG - 1 does not prevent binding of a polypeptide substrate to Hsc70 . The nucleotide ex - change activity of BAG - 1 , however , may reduce the time window for stable substrate binding to Hsc70 in each AT - Pase cycle . In this situation nonnative luciferase is prema - turely released from Hsc70 , and refolding of luciferase be - comes unproductive . Notably , under certain experimental conditions a pro - moting effect of BAG - 1 on luciferase refolding was ob - served . When luciferase was thermally denatured in the presence of Hsc70 and Hsp40 , followed by addition of BAG - 1 upon transfer to refolding conditions , BAG - 1 stim - ulated an initial burst of luciferase activity ( Figure 4 ) . In this situation a subpopulation of luciferase molecules which was associated with Hsc70 apparently folded into the en - zymatically active state in a single release event triggered by the nucleotide exchange activity of BAG - 1 . The data in - dicate that BAG - 1 can act as a substrate - release factor of Hsc70 . Such afunction of the cofactor has not been noted previously . Since ternary complexes have been observed which comprise BAG - 1 , Hsc70 , and a polypeptide sub - strate such as c - Jun and reduced carboxymethylated a - lactalbumin , it rather appeared that BAG - 1 stabilizes an Hsc70 / substrate interaction ( Takayama ef a / . , 1997 ; Zei - neref a / . , 1997 ) . Possibly , different polypeptide substrates are differently affected by the regulatory activity of BAG - 1 on Hsc70 . However , analysis of Hsc70 / BAG - 1 / substrate complexes in previous studies was not performed in the presence of ATP and Hsp40 . Yet , only in the presence of Hsp40 , BAG - 1 strongly accelerates Hsc70 ' s ATPase ac - tivity , creating a highly dynamic situation apparently char - acterized by rapid cycles of substrate binding and release ( Höhfeld and Jentsch , 1997 ) ( see above ) . The capacity of BAG - 1 to induce substrate release from Hsc70 may be crucial for the physiological function of BAG - 1 . BAG - 1 was initially identified as a binding partner of the cell death inhibitor Bcl - 2 and shown to stimulate the anti - apoptotic activity of Bcl - 2 ( Takayama ef a / . , 1995 ) . In - triguingly , interaction of BAG - 1 with Bcl - 2 involves Hsc70 ( Takayama ef a / . , 1997 ) . BAG - 1 may thus assist chaper - one - mediated conformational changes of Bcl - 2 , conceiv - ably during insertion of the apoptosis inhibitor into the mitochondrial membrane or during complex formation of Bcl - 2 with CED - 4 homologs and caspases ( Reed , 1997 ; Golstein , 1997 ) . In this context it is interesting to note that distinct isoforms of the BAG - 1 protein exist which are lo - calized in the cytosol and the nucleus , respectively ( Pack - ham ef a / . , 1997 ) . While intracellular sorting signals appear to reside in the amino - terminus of the protein , the car - boxy - terminal domain is sufficient for regulation of Hsc70 ( Takayama ef a / . , 1997 ) ( see Figure 7 ) . Apparently , the amino - terminus of BAG - 1 serves to direct the substrate - release factor of Hsc70 to different subcellular locations . The data presented here on the refolding of firefly lu - ciferase show that functional specificity of Hsc70 is deter - mined by associating chaperone cofactors . When coop - erating with Hsp40 , Hsc70 represents a ' holding ' system which stabilizes nonnative molecules but is unable to me - diate folding to the native state ( Figure 8 ) . In the additional presence of Hip the ' holding ' system turns into a ' folding ' system that efficiently mediates refolding to the native state . On the other hand , BAG - 1 induces substrate re - lease from the Hsc70 / Hsp40 ' holding ' system , indepen - dent of the folding state of the bound polypeptide ( Figure 8 ) . ' Holding 1 and ' folding ' functions of Hsc70 were previ - ously described with regard to the Hsc70 / Hsp40 - mediat - ed refolding of ß - galactosidase ( Freeman and Morimoto , 1996 ) . Our findings extend this functional concept by re - vealing an additional level of regulation exerted by Hip and BAG - 1 through their antagonistic action . Although ob - tained for the folding of a model substrate , the presented data provide a conceptual framework for the understand - ing of Hsc70 - mediated processes in the mammalian cell . Cofactor - Modulated Functions of HscTO 1225 Materials and Methods Protein Expression and Purification Rat HscTO , rat Hip , human Hsp40 , and human BAG - 1 were re - combinantly expressed in Sf9 insect cells ( Hsc70 , Hip , and BAG - 1 ) and Escherichia coll ( Hsp40 ) and purified as described previ - ously ( H hfeld and Jentsch , 1997 ) . For expression of a carboxy - terminal fragment of human BAG - 1 ( c - BAG , amino acids 129 - 274 of human BAG - 1 / RAP46 ) , the corresponding cDNAfragment was amplified by PCR using pVL - bap ; - 7 ( H hfeld and Jentsch , 1997 ) as the template . Oligonucleotides used for PCR contained EcoRI and amHI restriction sites that were utilized for sub - cloning of the PCR fragment into vector pVL1392 ( PharMingen ) . The resultant plasmid was used to obtain recombinant bac - ulovirusfor infection of Sf9 insect cells . Sf9 cells were grown and maintained as described by the manufacturer ( PharMingen ) . After growth of infected cells for ~ 60 h , c - BAG was purified by chro - matography on DEAE - Sepharose ( Pharmacia ) , Bio - Gel HT hy - droxyapatite ( Βίο - Rad ) and Source 30Q material ( Pharmacia ) . Molar concentrations of Hip were calculated for a pentameric complex ( J . H hfeld , unpublished data ) . Molar concentrations of Hsc70 , Hsp40 , and BAG - 1 were calculated based on the molec - ular mass of a monomer . Preprocecropin A was chemically syn - thesized as previously described by Klappaef a / . ( 1991 ) . Luciferase Refolding Assay Chaperone - mediated refolding of heat - denatured firefly lu - ciferase was analyzed essentially as described by Minami et a / . ( 1996 ) . Hsc70 and Hsc70 cofactors were incubated in 10mM MOPS - KOH , pH 7 . 2 , 50 mM KCI , 3 mM MgCI 2 , 2 mM dithiothreitol , 2 mM ATP , for 5 min at room temperature . Purified luciferase ( Sig - ma ) was added to a final concentration of 0 . 06 μΜ and samples were incubated at 42 °C for 15 min . Subsequently , ATP was added to a final concentration of 4mM , and 2 . 5 % rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( Promega ) or purified Hsc70 cofactors were added as indi - cated followed by incubation at 30 °C . Given values for the con - centration of Hsc70 and Hsc70 cofactors represent the amount of protein present during refolding . Luciferase activity was deter - mined as described in the manufacturer ' s protocol ( Promega ) . The enzymatic activity of native luciferase diluted on ice in refold - ing buffer containing 1 mg / ml of BSA was set to 100 % . Luciferase Aggregation Assay Hsc70 ( 3 μΜ ) was incubated with 2 μΜ of Hsp40 , 3 μΜ of BAG - 1 , and 3 μΜ of Hip oligomer as indicated for 5 min at room tempera - ture in 20 mM MOPS - KOH , pH 7 . 2 , 50 mM KCI , 2 mM MgCI 2 , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 2mM ATP ( buffer A ) . After addition of luciferase ( 0 . 06 μΜ final concentration ) samples were incubated at 42 °C for 15 min , followed by transfer on ice and addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mM . Samples were centrif uged at 100 000 g for 20 min at 4°C , supernatant and pellet fraction were separated and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting using a poly - clonal anti - luciferase antibody ( Promega ) . Total luciferase in the supernatant and pellet fraction was quantified and set to 100 % . The amount of luciferase detected in the pellet fractions is pres - ented as percentage of total protein which formed protein aggre - gates during heat denaturation . Analysis of Luciferase / Chaperone Complexes by Gel Filtration Luciferase ( 1 μΜ ) was incubated in buffer A at 42 °C for 15 min in the presence of 3μΜ of Hsc70 , 2μΜ of Hsp40 , 6μΜ of Hip oligomer , and 6μΜ of BAG - 1 when indicated . Samples were transferred on ice , a two - fold volume of buffer Β ( 20 ΓΠΜ MOPS - KOH , pH 7 . 2 , 50 mM KCI , 1 mM dithiothreitol ) containing 2mM EDTA and 10 % glycerol was added , followed by centrifugation at 100000 g for 30 min at 4°C . The resultant supernatant was ap - plied to a Superose 12 gel filtration column ( Pharmacia ) equili - brated in buffer B containing 1 ITIM EDTA and 5 % glycerol . Col - lected fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE after protein pre - cipitation with trichloroacetic acid . Hsc70 and Hip were detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or by Ponceau S - stain - ing following transfer of separated polypeptides onto nitrocellu - lose membranes . BAG - 1 and luciferase were detected after im - munoblotting using an anti - BAG - 1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) and an anti - luciferase antibody ( Promega ) . ATPase Assays Rates of ATP hydrolysis were determined as described ( Liberek et a / . , 1991 ) . Hsc70 was incubated together with individual co - factors and preprocecropin A as indicated in 20 mM MOPS - KOH , pH 7 . 2 , 50 mM KCI , 2mM MgCI 2 , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 400 μΜ [ α - 32 P ] ATP at 30 °C . Formed ADP was quantified using a Phospho - rimager system after thin layer chromatography of aliquots that were ten - fold diluted in 20 mM MOPS - KOH , pH 7 . 2 , 20 mM EDTA .
