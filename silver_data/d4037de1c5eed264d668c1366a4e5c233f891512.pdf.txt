However , creative writers may have mixed perceptions about their ownership of the story when there are significant AI contributions . We explore opportunities for AIs to support fiction writers without compromising their feeling of story ownership . In this paper , we present preliminary results of a formative interview study with fiction writers ( ùëÅ = 9 ) , focusing on their practice and the challenges of the story - writing process . We discuss some of the challenges these writers face and propose design opportunities to address these challenges in ways other than text generation . KEYWORDS writing support tools , creativity support tools , interview study , fiction writing , human - AI collaboration 1 BACKGROUND HCI research on AI writing assistants has primarily focused on ap - plications for text generation . For instance , Chung et al . [ 3 ] presents a tool , TaleBrush , that generates a story according to a manual sketch of the protagonist‚Äôs fortune graph . While this approach has many useful applications ( e . g . [ 2 , 6 , 7 ] ) , creative writers are wary of AI text generation because of questions about ownership of the text and artistic integrity [ 1 ] . Yet AI support can take many forms , and we are inspired by others who have looked beyond text generation to support writers . These include providing constantly updated summaries to help writers structure and reflect [ 4 ] and assisting the writing process in line with the writers‚Äô values and preferences [ 5 ] . To identify areas where fiction writers could benefit from AI sup - port , we present preliminary results from a formative interview study . 2 FORMATIVE STUDY : INTERVIEWS WITH FICTION WRITERS We conducted 9 semi - structured interviews with fiction writers ( referred to as W0 - W8 ) to investigate the challenges they experience . Details of participants‚Äô experience can be found in Table 1 . The interview questions were selected to shed light on the specifics of their processes that related work on support systems for Category Number of Participants Genre Horror / Thriller 2 Fan Fiction 2 Historical Fiction 2 Science Fiction 1 Fantasy 1 Speculative 1 Story Type Character - driven 4 Character - and plot - driven 5 Writer Type Professional 4 Hobbyist 5 Experience ( Years ) Mean 9 Median 8 Min / Max 4 / 25 Table 1 : The breakdown of participants according to their writing experience . For genre , story type , and writer type , participants were asked to select one option that best de - scribed them . All professional writers report also writing as a hobby . writers has not focused on . We aimed to identify challenges writ - ers face during specific story - building processes such as character development , plot development , and writing dialogue . 3 SELECTED FINDINGS Based on our qualitative analysis , we identify several problems that can be addressed through new AI - driven support tools . Creating distinct characters . Creating believable characters with authentic , distinct voices and perspectives is a challenge . W4 dis - cusses how careful writers must be for each line of dialogue , where they consider the character‚Äôs personality traits and knowledge : ‚ÄúThe main question is , how much are they going to reveal through their dialogue ? How much do they know about the world or the sit - uation ? And then there‚Äôs things at the very sentence level . How do they talk ? Are they an anxious person ? They‚Äôre probably going to be using filler words like " like " or trailing off or speaking in fractured Conference‚Äô17 , July 2017 , Washington , DC , USA Jessi Stark , Anthony Tang , Young - Ho Kim , Joonsuk Park , and Daniel Wigdor fragments . A confident person is less likely to do that . ‚Äù There are also more sensitive aspects of creating characters , like avoiding stereotypes or otherwise offensive portrayals . W5 has encountered this when writing characters whose ethnic background is different from theirs : ‚Äú If I‚Äôm writing for a character from a different ethnic or historical background , I might ask someone from that particular culture , like , is this an accurate portrayal of that character ? I know in the literature scene , there‚Äôs a big emphasis now on what is known as sensitivity readers . So these are people who might just be people from a different background . They‚Äôll read through your story and say that , you know , this doesn‚Äôt seem representative of our culture . ‚Äù Writing about unfamiliar experiences . Writers can struggle to write about things they haven‚Äôt personally experienced , which can create difficulties when their characters go through such experi - ences . For example , as W6 mentioned : ‚Äú For the most part because I am not a super romantic person , most of the relationships that I‚Äôve had have been like familial , friendly . So that tends to be just what I write about : familial , friendly relationships . So it‚Äôs when I need to think about other types of relationships , like I‚Äôm thinking about business relationships or thinking about more romantically inclined relation - ships . Those tend to be a bit hard to start with , because I struggle with figuring out what exactly the conflicts could be between those . That‚Äôs probably the hardest part . ‚Äù W0 uses media and real people for inspi - ration when creating characters they don‚Äôt relate to : ‚Äú When I was creating this character , this girl is a 13 year old girl . Obviously I‚Äôm not a 13 year old girl , so I have to apply my logic of what I witnessed from media and how I perceive that , or even those who are younger than me that I‚Äôve had the privilege to talk to . I applied those experiences with them to generate a character based on all of that . So when I was making [ this character ] , for example , I had to look at , okay , she has the mysterious feelings of how Coraline Jones was in [ the film ] Coraline . But she maybe has a little bit of my younger cousin , who is a little bit more aggressive . You have to take combinations from real life experience . So living and watching a lot of stuff helps to generate ideas to form your character . ‚Äù Ensuring story timeline continuity . Writers often tinker with the timeline of stories as they are being written . Other times , they will explore adding one theme / aspect to see whether it helps to tell the story better . Removing one of these ideas may often mean needing to go back to find passages or dialogue that need to be revised . W0 discusses how challenging this can be : ‚Äú Keeping the continuity [ of character backstories ] intact is very difficult . . . I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve written a scene , and I would be like , " oh no , this is not supposed to happen like this , because I did it this [ other ] way in the backstory . " So which one do I change ? Do I change the backstory or do I change this ? ‚Äù In addition to the background details , the sequential order of events can also be difficult to keep track of . W3 keeps a written timeline to help with this : ‚Äú I think for me one of the important things has been not mixing up the timelines . So I do have a timeline that I‚Äôm working on for story I‚Äôm writing that just helps me keep everything straight and make sure that I haven‚Äôt accidentally written something happening in a year where the character wouldn‚Äôt have been there . ‚Äù Figure 1 : An example interaction using AI Character Models . Top : the model for John‚Äôs character has pointed out a piece of dialogue that doesn‚Äôt match John‚Äôs personality ; the user can ignore the model or heed its advice . Bottom : the model for Sally‚Äôs character has reviewed her dialogue and confirms that it is in line with her personality . Ensuring factual correctness . Many writers encounter challenges when writing about settings or objects that are unfamiliar ( e . g . loca - tions , time periods , tools , etc . ) , as this necessitates doing additional preparation / rigorous research work . Some do not do this , but then run the risk of writing something that becomes less believable . W5 encountered this exact issue : ‚Äú I remember when I was writing a novel in the medieval period , I tried to make sure that some of the details in the background story were actually accurate because I didn‚Äôt want to publish or to share it with someone else and then they‚Äôll say , " oh , that didn‚Äôt exist in that time period " . . . that‚Äôs one of the greatest challenges . ‚Äù 4 FUTURE WORK One limitation of our current study is the absence of any observa - tions of the micro - processes that fiction writers follow when using their current writing tools ( e . g . word processors ) . Such details will be very useful in future stages of this work , particularly when it comes to building tools such as the ones described below . Our work has thus far focused more on high - level conceptual ideas for writing support tools , but we plan to examine writers‚Äô micro - processes in future work . Nonetheless , based on the findings from our interviews , we have identified several opportunities for AI - driven tools for supporting fiction writers . We intend to prototype these tools and evaluate them with authors . AI Character Models . AI representations of fictional characters , created according to the writer‚Äôs input , could help the writer to maintain dialogue style ( Figure 1 ) , character knowledge , and charac - ter histories . Tools can assist by identifying dialogue and passages that are ‚Äúout of character‚Äù or inconsistent with prior behaviour ; alternatively , they could provide suggestions for amending such passages . Can AI Support Fiction Writers Without Writing For Them ? Conference‚Äô17 , July 2017 , Washington , DC , USA Experience Advising . AI tools can bridge the gaps between a writer‚Äôs own experience and what their character is experiencing . For example , if a character were experiencing a traumatic event that the author themselves has never been through , the tool could advise the author on the emotions , actions , and language that the character would be likely to exhibit . Alternatively , it could describe procedural experiences unfamiliar to the writer , like the steps involved in landing a plane or performing surgery . Continuity . Much like how semantic code editors can facilitate swapping out names of variables , or recognize when function calls are inconsistent with function definitions , we could imagine writing support tools being able to identify and locate continuity problems for writers that arise during the writing process . Fact Checking . Real - world facts sometimes need to be incorporated into fiction . For example , historical fiction and science fiction will likely make use of historical and scientific facts , respectively . AI tools could check the writer‚Äôs text for factual inaccuracies . Of course , intentionally fictitious aspects should remain untouched . Such tools could work either on - demand ( e . g . like how a compiler works ) , or on - the - fly as the writer is preparing the text . REFERENCES [ 1 ] Oloff C . Biermann , Ning F .
