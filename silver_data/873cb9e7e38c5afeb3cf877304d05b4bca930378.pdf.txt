Kinetics of ligand - dependent IGF - IR endocytosis determines how IGF induces such downstream signaling outputs . Here , we find that the insulin receptor substrate ( IRS ) (cid:0) 1 modulates how long ligand - activated IGF - IR remains at the cell surface before undergoing endocytosis in mammalian cells . IRS - 1 interacts with the clathrin adaptor complex AP2 . IRS - 1 , but not an AP2 - binding - deficient mutant , delays AP2 - mediated IGF - IR endocytosis after the ligand stimulation . Mechanistically , IRS - 1 inhibits the recruitment of IGF - IR into clathrin - coated structures ; for this reason , IGF - IR avoids rapid endocytosis and prolongs its activity on the cell surface . Accelerating IGF - IR endocytosis via IRS - 1 depletion induces the shift from sustained to transient Akt activation and augments FoxO - mediated transcription . Our study establishes a new role for IRS - 1 as an endocytic regulator of IGF - IR that ensures sustained IGF bioactivity , independent of its classic role as an adaptor in IGF - IR signaling .

Ligand binding to the IGF - IR extracellular domain causes conformational changes of the intra - cellular region , inducing the tyrosine kinase domain to autophosphorylate multiple Tyr residues and activate intrinsic RTK activity ( Kavran et al . , 2014 ; Favelyukis et al . , 2001 ) . IGF - IR then initiates downstream signaling through tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate ( IRS ) adaptor proteins to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) - Akt pathway and its various biological responses ( Myers et al . , 1996 ; Sun et al . , 1993 ; White , 2002 ) . IGF / IGF - IR stimulates the PI3K - Akt pathway in a stereotypical way – sustained tonal induction . Sustained induction is thought to define the specific biological outcomes of IGF signaling , and distin - guish the function of the IGF ligand from other RTKs / ligands that access the Akt cascade ( Gross and Rotwein , 2016 ; Kubota et al . , 2012 ) . In particular , sustained activation of the PI3K - Akt pathway , mediated by IGF - IR , induces cell proliferation in multiple types of cells , cell survival in neural cells , Yoneyama et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e32893 .

To date , the mechanism by which IGF - IR produces sustained signaling remains poorly understood . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is a major regulator of RTKs ( Goh and Sorkin , 2013 ) involv - ing the heterotetrameric AP2 complex composed of large a and b 2 , medium m 2 , and small s 2 subu - nits ( Collins et al . , 2002 ) . AP2 binds to transmembrane cargo proteins that contain specific motifs such as Yxx F ( Y denotes Tyr ; x , any amino acid ; and F , bulky hydrophobic residue ) serving as m 2 binding sites ( Owen and Evans , 1998 ; Traub and Bonifacino , 2013 ) . In addition , AP2 associates with clathrin and with endocytic accessory proteins at the plasma membrane to coordinate clathrin - coated pit ( CCP ) formation ( Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . Ligand - bound RTKs enter the endocytic process through CME , but perhaps with different signaling consequences . If endocytosed RTKs are sorted to lysosomes for degradation , this process down - regulates signaling as exemplified by the model RTKs including epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and platelet - derived growth factor receptor ( Goh and Sorkin , 2013 ) . On the other hand , some RTKs continue to signal locally across the endosome membrane even after endocytosis ( Schenck et al . , 2008 ; Villasen˜or et al . , 2015 ; Lin et al . , 2006 ) . In either case , RTK internalization strongly impacts its signaling outputs . Thus , the duration at the cell surface of ligand - bound RTKs , which is tightly regulated by CME , critically fine - tunes their signaling and biological functions . Accordingly , we hypothesize that ligand - bound IGF - IR , which exhibits sustained activation and slow degradation ( Fukushima et al . , 2012 ; Mao et al . , 2011 ; Zheng et al . , 2012 ) , undergoes slow or delayed CME ( Martins et al . , 2011 ; Monami et al . , 2008 ) . To evaluate this idea , here we study the molecular components regulating perdurance of IGF - IR at the cell surface through its interactions with CME , and elucidate how this dictates IGF sig - naling and outputs . Among IRS family proteins IRS - 1 and IRS - 2 are well known as major substrates of IGF - IR ( Taniguchi et al . , 2006 ; White , 2002 ) . We and others have shown that IRS - associated proteins con - tribute to the regulation of IRS - 1 / IRS - 2 function through distinct mechanisms ( Ando et al . , 2015 ; eLife digest Mammals , including humans , use signaling molecules called hormones to carry information from one cell to another . Insulin - like growth factor ( or IGF for short ) is a hormone that is essential throughout an animal’s lifetime . It is needed for growth and for many of the chemical processes that must occur to maintain life ( which are collectively referred to as an animal’s metabolism ) . IGF binds to and activates a protein found on the surface of cells , which then transmits the signal inside the cells . This surface protein is known as the IGF - I receptor , and once it is activated by IGF binding , it is removed from the cell surface and then incorporated inside the cell to switch off the signal . The IGF signal in cells needs to be properly balanced to prevent disorders of growth and metabolism . How long the activated IGF - I receptor remains at the cell surface and when the IGF - I receptor starts to enter inside the cells after cells receive IGF influence the signals within the cell . Often IGF signaling must be activated for long periods , for example when cells maintain their balance between making and breaking proteins . However , it remains poorly understood how the IGF - I receptor produces a sustained signal . Yoneyama et al . have now focused on a protein called IRS - 1 , which was known to act downstream of the receptor . The experiments revealed that this protein determines how long activated IGF - IR remains at the cell surface before it enters inside cells . It achieves this by binding to a complex of proteins , known as AP2 , which normally internalizes the IGF - I receptor . However , when IRS - 1 binds , it inhibits AP2 . This means that the receptor is no longer rapidly removed from the cell surface and can continue signaling for long periods of time . The findings of Yoneyama et al . help to explain how long - term IGF signaling is regulated . Further work that builds on these findings could help scientists to understand how uncontrolled IGF signals cause the development of diseases including cancer and metabolic disorders .

In this study , we discovered AP2 is also an IRS - 1 - associated protein . Unex - pectedly IRS - 1 promotes the surface retention of activated IGF - IR through inhibiting AP2 - dependent internalization of IGF - IR , and this is independent of IRS’s classic role as an adaptor protein in IGF - IR and insulin receptor signaling . The ability of IRS - 1 to prolong surface retention of IGF - IR is essential for long - term PI3K - Akt signaling . Our results establish a novel role of IRS - 1 in ensuring the sustained effects of IGFs via its direct control of IGF - IR internalization . Results IRS - 1 interacts with the clathrin adaptor AP2 complex through its Yxx ’ motifs To identify the IRS - 1 - interacting proteins that potentially regulate insulin / IGF signaling , we searched the candidates in our previous yeast two - hybrid screening ( Hakuno et al . , 2007 ) . We found the m 2 subunit of clathrin adaptor AP2 complex among the frequently obtained clones ( Figure 1A ) . Co - immunoprecipitation assay using HEK293T cells expressing FLAG - tagged IRS - 1 or IRS - 2 revealed that endogenous AP2 subunits ( a - adaptin and m 2 ) were detected in a complex with IRS - 1 , but not with IRS - 2 ( Figure 1B ) . In addition , a portion of AP2 was co - immunoprecipitated with endogenous IRS - 1 as well as ectopically expressed FLAG - IRS - 1 in L6 myoblasts , and this interaction was not affected by IGF - I stimulation ( Figure 1C , D ) . Using IRS - 1 truncated mutants , we mapped the central region ( amino acid residues 543 – 865 ) which is necessary for the binding to AP2 ( Figure 1E ) . This region is almost identical to that for the clathrin adaptor AP1 complex found in our previous study , which binds to Yxx F motifs of IRS - 1 including Tyr 608 , Tyr 628 , and Tyr 658 via its m 1 subunit ( Yoneyama et al . , 2013 ) . Indeed , the Ala mutation of all these Tyr residues in IRS - 1 , but not a single substitution , completely abolished the binding to m 2 in vitro ( IRS - 1 3YA mutant ; Figure 1F , G ) . We also analyzed the crystal structures of m 2 C - terminal subdomain ( C - m 2 ) bound to IRS - 1 Yxx F motifs ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A , B and Table 1 ) . Importantly , the side chains of Tyr and Met residues of IRS - 1 Yxx F motifs are inserted into the binding pockets of m 2 , which are shared by the AP2 cargo proteins ( Owen and Evans , 1998 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) . Collectively , these results indicate that IRS - 1 is recognized by the AP2 complex via the m 2 subunit in the very similar manner to conventional endocytic cargos . The m 2 subunit of AP2 cannot recognize phosphorylated Yxx F sequence due to its limited capac - ity ( Kittler et al . , 2008 ; Owen and Evans , 1998 ) . However , IGF - I stimulation did not inhibit the co - immunoprecipitation of IRS - 1 with AP2 ( Figure 1C , D ) . To evaluate the stoichiometry of IRS - 1 Tyr phosphorylation in IGF - I - stimulated cells , we analyzed the amount of IRS - 1 capable of binding to GST - C - m 2 in lysates of cells treated with or without IGF - I ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1D , E ) . Although the amounts of both pulled - down and immunoprecipitated IRS - 1 were comparable , Tyr - phosphorylated IRS - 1 was hardly pulled down by m 2 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1F ) , indicating low stoichiometry of IRS - 1 Tyr phosphorylation after IGF - I stimulation and existence of a non - phos - phorylated IRS - 1 pool which interacts with AP2 . IRS - 1 promotes cell surface retention of activated IGF - IR via its Yxx ’ motifs Since AP2 plays a central role in the CME of RTKs , we reasoned that the interaction of IRS - 1 with AP2 affects the internalization of IGF - IR . Using the surface biotinylation assay , we first analyzed the changes in cell surface IGF - IR in L6 cells . Long - term stimulation with IGF - I ( 3 to 12 hr ) induced the significant reduction of phosphorylated IGF - IR ( phospho - IGF - IR ) , which was assessed by Tyr 1131 phosphorylation in the activation loop ( Favelyukis et al . , 2001 ) , at the cell surface ( Figure 2A , B ) . Similar results were obtained in the analyses of other phosphorylation sites in IGF - IR ( Figure 2—fig - ure supplement 1A ) . No reduction of phospho - IGF - IR or total IGF - IR at the cell surface was observed during short - term stimulation with IGF - I ( 5 to 60 min ) ( Figure 2A and B ) . Ubiquitination of IGF - IR has been proposed as an important event inducing its internalization and down - regulation ( Monami et al . , 2008 ; Mao et al . , 2011 ) . We observed that IGF - I - induced ubiquitination of IGF - IR reached the maximum 60 min after IGF - I stimulation in L6 cells ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) .

Strikingly , phospho - IGF - IR at the cell surface was sustained even after pro - longed IGF - I stimulation in GFP - IRS - 1 - expressing cells while the reduction was observed in the con - trol cells expressing GFP only ( Figure 2D , E ) . In contrast , GFP - IRS - 2 expression did not affect the reduction in phospho - IGF - IR ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1C , D ) . To investigate the requirement Figure 1 .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 32893 4 of 34 Research article Biochemistry and Chemical Biology Cell Biology of IRS - 1 interaction with AP2 for the surface retention of phospho - IGF - IR , we analyzed the cells expressing the GFP - IRS - 1 3YA mutant , which lacks the binding motifs for the m 2 subunit of AP2 com - plex . In contrast to GFP - IRS - 1 wild - type ( WT ) - expressing cells , surface phospho - IGF - IR was reduced by prolonged IGF - I stimulation in GFP - IRS - 1 3YA - expressing cells ( Figure 2D , E ) . These data strongly suggest that IRS - 1 can promote cell surface retention of activated IGF - IR via its Yxx F motifs . The Tyr residues of the Yxx F motifs of IRS - 1 for binding to AP2 ( Tyr 608 , Tyr 628 , and Tyr 658 ) are known to be phosphorylated by IR / IGF - IR and in turn serve as putative binding sites of PI3K ( Sun et al . , 1993 ; Myers et al . , 1996 ) . We next asked whether their Tyr phosphorylation of IRS - 1 is involved in the surface retention of IGF - IR . Here , we used the IRS - 1 D PTB mutant which lacks the phosphotyrosine binding domain ( PTB ) and therefore cannot be phosphorylated due to the inability to interact with IGF - IR ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1E ) . As with GFP - IRS - 1 WT , expression of GFP - IRS - 1 D PTB resulted in the surface retention of phospho - IGF - IR after prolonged IGF - I stimula - tion ( Figure 2F , G ) , indicating that the IRS - 1 - induced surface retention of activated IGF - IR is indepen - dent on the Tyr phosphorylation of IRS - 1 .

In clathrin - depleted cells , the reduction in phospho - IGF - IR observed after long - term IGF - I stimulation was completely blocked ( Figure 3A ) . Similarly , the knockdown of AP2 ( m 2 ) , but not of another cla - thrin adaptor AP1 ( m 1 ) , inhibited the reduction of phospho - IGF - IR ( Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) . The canonical CME model of RTKs involves their rapid depletion from the cell surface in response to the ligands ( Goh and Sorkin , 2013 ) . Surface biotinylation analysis in Figure 2A revealed that the total amount of IGF - IR at the cell surface is not changed by IGF - I . Surface IGF - IR level reflects the balance between endocytosis , recycling , and the transport of newly synthesized receptor to the plasma membrane . When the recycling was inhibited by primaquine ( van Weert et al . , 2000 ) , sur - face IGF - IR levels were reduced by IGF - I treatment within 1 hr , and phospho - IGF - IR levels followed this time - dependent changes ( Figure 3C ) , indicating that IGF - I indeed triggers IGF - IR endocytosis from cell surface and that the recycling contributes to the apparent surface maintenance of IGF - IR . We also assessed the contribution of newly synthesized IGF - IR by using cycloheximide which could inhibit the increase in precursor IGF - IR observed in long - term IGF - I - stimulated cells . IGF - I reduced surface IGF - IR in the presence of cycloheximide ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2A ) . These observa - tions support the notion that transport mechanisms other than endocytosis contribute to the mainte - nance of surface IGF - IR level . Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B ( PTP1B ) , an endoplasmic reticulum - resident phosphatase , has been reported to down - regulate IGF - IR by dephosphorylation ( Buckley et al . , 2002 ) . We tested the possible involvement of PTP1B in long - term IGF - I - induced reduction in activated IGF - IR by using the substrate - trapping mutant ( PTP1B D181A ) . Phosphorylation levels of IGF - IR observed 1 hr after IGF - I treatment and the subsequent reduction at the later period ( 6 hr ) were comparable for both PTP1B D181A - expressing and non - expressing cells as revealed by immunofluorescence ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2B ) , indicating a negligible role of PTP1B in the down - regulation of phospho - IGF - IR in our observation . To directly monitor the internalized IGF - IR , we stimulated surface - biotinylated cells with IGF - I and then analyzed the internalized IGF - IR fraction ( see Materials and methods ) . It revealed that internal - ized IGF - IR was detected within 15 min after surface biotinylation ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3A ) . Similar results also came from the immunofluorescence analysis of a double - tagged IGF - IR - transfected cells . The IGF - IR - HA - EGFP construct that we developed contains an extracellular HA - tag and intracellular EGFP and can be utilized to directly monitor the internalization by following uptake of anti - HA antibody added to the media prior to ligand treatment ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3B , C ) . Internalized fraction of the double - tagged IGF - IR was detected within 15 to 60 min in both IGF - I - stimulated and non - stimulated conditions ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3D , E ) . The internali - zation of IGF - IR observed in the non - stimulated state was not affected by knockdown of AP2 ( Fig - ure 3—figure supplement 3F ) , indicating that the basal endocytosis of IGF - IR is not dependent on AP2 . In contrast , phospho - IGF - IR was predominantly localized to the cell surface and did not overlap with internalized IGF - IR ( HA - positive ) within 1 hr in the ligand - stimulated cells ( Figure 3—figure sup - plement 3D ) . At the later period ( 6 hr ) , phospho - IGF - IR was detected in LysoTracker - positive com - partments ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B , left ) . More importantly , the phospho - IGF - IR targeting to lysosomes was abolished by knockdown of AP2 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B , right ; Fig - ure 3—figure supplement 1C ) , suggesting that ligand - activated IGF - IR undergoes AP2 - dependent endocytosis . Using live cell total internal fluorescence microscopy ( TIRF - M ) , we investigated the detailed onset of IGF - IR internalization . The assembly of AP2 into clathrin - coated structures can be monitored by the expression of AP2 s 2 subunit fused with monomeric red fluorescent protein ( mRFP ) ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ) . IGF - IR - EGFP was uniformly distributed within the plasma membrane , and then gradually colocalized with s 2 - mRFP 30 min after IGF - I stimulation ( Figure 3D , left ) . We also observed similar results in the fixed cells where phospho - IGF - IR was overlapped with AP2 and cla - thrin ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4A – C ) . In more detail , IGF - IR clustered after IGF - I stimulation , and then accumulated in pre - existing AP2 - positive spots ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4D ) . EGFP - fused EGFR , which is a representative RTK showing rapid CME , was rapidly re - distributed into AP2 - Yoneyama et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e32893 .

Intriguingly , quantitative analyses revealed that IGF - I - induced increase in the colocalization rate of IGF - IR with AP2 was significantly slower than EGFR ( Figure 3D ) . IRS - 1 inhibits the AP2 - dependent internalization of IGF - IR Expression of IRS - 1 WT , but not 3YA mutant , induced surface retention of activated IGF - IR ( Figure 2D , E ) , which phenocopies that of AP2 knockdown ( Figure 3B ) . We next asked whether IRS - 1 could disrupt IGF - IR internalization . To clearly evaluate ligand - dependent receptor internalization , we performed surface biotinylation assay of IGF - I - stimulated cells when the recycling was inhibited by primaquine . While surface IGF - IR levels were gradually reduced after the ligand stimulation in cells expressing GFP and GFP - IRS - 1 3YA , such reduction turned to be slower in cells expressing GFP - IRS - 1 WT ( Figure 4A ) . In addition , the TIRF - M revealed that expression of GFP - IRS - 1 WT , but not of 3YA mutant , significantly inhibited the targeting of phospho - IGF - IR in AP2 - positive spots with diffused localization of phospho - IGF - IR ( Figure 4C , D ) , indicating that the IRS - 1 binding to AP2 inhib - its the ligand - induced association of IGF - IR with AP2 - positive spots . Since AP2 regulates CME of various membrane cargoes , we next asked if ectopic expression of IRS - 1 affects endocytosis of other cargoes . The internalization of transferrin receptor ( TfR ) , integrin , and EGFR , which are endocytosed through CME , was evaluated . We analyzed the endocytosis of TfR , which has no physical interaction with IGF - IR ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ) , by measuring uptake of fluorescent - labeled transferrin . Overexpression of IRS - 1 did not affect the uptake of trans - ferrin ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ) . Integrins including b 1 are involved in the crosstalk with IGF - IR signaling ( Kiely et al . , 2005 ) . Surface level and internalization of integrin b 1 were assessed by labeling cell surface with anti - integrin b 1 antibody and chasing its uptake ( see Materials and meth - ods ) . In L6 cells stably expressing integrin b 1 which modestly interacts with IGF - IR ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2A ) , surface expression of integrin b 1 was not statistically different between IRS - 1 - expressing and control cells ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2B ; p = 0 . 188 ) . The incorporated amount of anti - integrin b 1 antibody was partially reduced in IRS - 1 - expressing cells ( Figure 4—figure supple - ment 2C , D ) . We also examined the endocytosis of EGFR induced by low - dose EGF , which is depen - dent on CME ( Sigismund et al . , 2008 ) , by observing localization of the transfected EGFR - GFP . Modest delay of EGFR endocytosis was observed at the early period of EGF stimulation in IRS - 1 - expressing cells ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2E – F ) . These observations indicate that IRS - 1 can influence endocytosis of receptors other than IGF - IR . We also confirmed that the number of AP2 spots at TIRF field was not affected by the expression of IRS - 1 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ) . By using TIRF - M , we noticed that GFP - IRS - 1 colocalizing with AP2 is localized to submembraneous actin fibers , which possess critical roles in CME ( Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ) ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1D ) . If endogenous IRS - 1 inhibits IGF - IR internalization , knockdown of IRS - 1 would accelerate the pro - cess of active IGF - IR reduction triggered by long - term IGF - I stimulation . IRS - 1 knockdown in L6 cells resulted in a faster reduction of phospho - IGF - IR ( ~ 2 fold ) with a partial decrease in IGF - IR level ( Figure 5A , B ; reduction rate of p - IGF - IR from 1 to 3 hr of IGF - I treatment ( value ± SEM ( / hr ) ) , siCtrl , 7 . 8 ± 2 . 2 ; siIRS1 _ 1 , 15 . 1 ± 1 . 7 ; siIRS1 _ 2 , 17 . 2 ± 2 . 4 ; p < 0 . 05 versus siCtrl ) .

Notably , the partial reduction of total IGF - IR levels observed in IRS - 1 - depleted cells was res - cued by the combined knockdown of AP2 ( Figure 5C , D ) . The accelerated reduction of phospho - IGF - IR after IGF - I stimulation in IRS - 1 - depleted cells was also attenuated by the combined knock - down of AP2 ( Figure 5E , F ) , indicating that knockdown of IRS - 1 accelerates IGF - I - induced IGF - IR internalization as well as reducing IGF - IR levels in an AP2 - dependent manner . These results further support the notion that IRS - 1 inhibits AP2 - mediated internalization of IGF - IR and its long - term attenuation . mTOR - dependent degradation of IRS - 1 is required for the initiation of IGF - IR internalization Previous studies have demonstrated a negative feedback loop in which long - term IGF / insulin stimu - lation induces the degradation of IRS - 1 in a PI3K / mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) - sensitive and protea - some - dependent fashion ( Harrington et al . , 2004 ; Haruta et al . , 2000 ) . In L6 cells , the amount of IRS - 1 was significantly reduced 3 to 6 hr after IGF - I stimulation with a concomitant increase in its phosphorylation ( Figure 6A ) . Pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin or Torin1 blunted the IRS - 1 degradation ( Figure 6B ) . Simultaneously , the reduction of phospho - IGF - IR after IGF - I stimulation was also blocked by mTORC1 inhibition ( Figure 6B , C ) . TIRF - M analysis revealed that phospho - IGF - IR was less clustered , and overlapped very little with AP2 in Torin1 - treated cells ( Figure 6D , E ) . In IRS - 1 - depleted cells , phospho - IGF - IR levels were decreased after long - term IGF - I stimulation even in the presence of Torin1 ( Figure 6F , G ) . Collectively , these results suggest that the degradation of IRS - 1 via mTORC1 - mediated feedback loop is required for the internalization of acti - vated IGF - IR . IRS - 1 is critical for sustained activation of Akt and inactivation of FoxO Given that CME affects signaling duration , we tested the role of IRS - 1 in the temporal changes in downstream pathways of IGF - IR . Like phospho - IGF - IR , IGF - I - induced phosphorylation of Akt was sus - tained within 1 hr with a gradual decrease afterwards in L6 cells ( Figure 6A ) . Ectopic expression of IRS - 1 WT , however , significantly prolonged the phosphorylation of Akt in response to IGF - I ( Figure 7A , B ) . Phosphorylation of FoxO1 , a transcription factor targeted by Akt ( Calnan and Brunet , 2008 ) , was also prolonged in IRS - 1 WT - overexpressing cells . These described effects on Akt and FoxO1 were not observed in cells overexpressing IRS - 1 3YA mutant ( Figure 7A , B ) . In addition , over - expression of IRS - 2 did not prolong the IGF - I - dependent Akt phosphorylation with a slight increase in its maximum response ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1A ) . We next assessed the role of endogenous IRS - 1 in the Akt - FoxO signaling duration by using siRNA - mediated knockdown of IRS - 1 . In IRS - 1 - depleted cells , the phosphorylation of Akt showed a very transient pattern with the acute decrease in the later period of IGF - I stimulation ( Figure 7C , D ) . During the shorter stimulation , IRS - 1 depletion had a minimal effect on the Akt phosphorylation , which may be explained by the compensatory increase in IRS - 2 protein ( Figure 7—figure supple - ment 1B ) . The phosphorylation of FoxO1 was transient in IRS - 1 - depleted cells while it was stable ( phospho - S256 in FoxO1 ) or accumulated ( phospho - T24 in FoxO1 or T32 in FoxO3 ) in control cells ( Figure 7C , D ) . The shift from sustained to transient phosphorylation of Akt in IRS - 1 - depleted cells was completely recovered by the rescue expression of IRS - 1 ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1C ) .

IRS - 1 is required for efficient down - regulation of FoxO - targeting genes mediated by IGF Since Akt inhibits the transcriptional activity of FoxOs via their phosphorylation ( Calnan and Brunet , 2008 ) , we reasoned that sustained activation of Akt in response to IGF could efficiently suppress FoxO - targeting gene expression . Here , we measured the mRNA expression levels of a series of FoxO - regulated genes related to muscle atrophy in which ubiquitin - proteasomal and autophagic protein degradation is enhanced ( Milan et al . , 2015 ; Mammucari et al . , 2007 ; Moses et al . , 2014 ; Stitt et al . , 2004 ; Zhao et al . , 2007 ) . In L6 myotubes long - term IGF - I stimulation significantly reduced the mRNA expression level of the two muscle - specific E3 ubiquitin ligases ( Atrogin1 and Murf1 ) and recently reported E3 ligases ( Smart and Musa1 ) as well as autophagy - related genes ( Lc3b and Gabarapl1 ) ( Figure 8A and Figure 8—figure supplement 1A ) . These genes were also down - regulated by IGF - I in L6 myoblasts ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1B ) . To reveal the contribu - tion of IRS - 1 to their expression , we analyzed their mRNA levels in IRS - 1 - depleted L6 myoblasts . In these cells , IGF - I - induced decrease in the atrophy - related genes was markedly attenuated ( Figure 8B ) . We also tested whether IRS - 1 knockdown would affect the myotube morphology ( Fig - ure 8—figure supplement 1C ) . We confirmed that lentiviral IRS - 1 knockdown did not affect the fusion rate ( the number of nuclei in myotube fiber ) ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1D ) . IRS - 1 - depleted myotubes showed a significant reduction in their diameter ( Figure 8C , D ) . These data indi - cate that IRS - 1 depletion leads to insufficient suppression of the FoxO - targeting genes in response to IGF even when Akt is being activated , but in a transient fashion . Discussion The canonical function of IRS proteins is to mediate signaling of IGF - IR to the PI3K - Akt pathway through Tyr phosphorylation ( Figure 9A ) ( White , 2002 ) . The present results reveal a new role of IRS - 1 independent of its Tyr phosphorylation : IRS - 1 regulates IGF - IR internalization to produce sus - tained activation of IGF signaling ( Figure 9B ) . IRS - 1 binds with AP2 to prevent IGF - IR recruitment into clathrin - coated structures and thus enhance surface retention of activated IGF - IR . This function of IRS - 1 in prolonging IGF - IR activity is critical for sustained activation of the PI3K - Akt pathway , and provides a key mechanism for how IGF - IR signaling induces specific biological actions of IGF ( Sacheck et al . , 2004 ; Ness and Wood , 2002 ; Bailey et al . , 2006 ; Stewart and Rotwein , 1996 ) . Thus , IRS - 1 plays a dual role as a signaling adaptor of IGF - IR and an endocytic regulator of IGF - IR . The first key finding of the present study is that IRS - 1 interacts with AP2 thereby regulating the rate of ligand - dependent internalization of IGF - IR . AP2 - mediated recognition of Yxx F motif in car - gos is a critical step for CCP formation ( Traub and Bonifacino , 2013 ; Kadlecova et al . , 2017 ) . Our results indicate that IRS - 1 inhibits the recruitment of IGF - IR to CCPs through Yxx F motifs in IRS - 1 . We have previously reported that another clathrin adaptor complex AP1 also binds to the same sites of IRS - 1 as AP2 ( Yoneyama et al . , 2013 ) . Since AP1 depletion did not prevent the down - regulation of activated IGF - IR ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) , the inhibitory effect of IRS - 1 on IGF - IR inter - nalization is based on its interaction with AP2 . In addition , IRS - 1 - depleted cells show the fast onset of IGF - IR internalization in response to IGF - I and the partial decrease in IGF - IR levels , both of which are presumably caused by the promotion of AP2 - dependent IGF - IR internalization and subsequent degradation ( Figure 5 ) . These results suggest that IRS - 1 is an inhibitory upstream regulator for AP2 - dependent internalization of IGF - IR ( Figure 9B ) . EGFR and some G - protein coupled receptor / b - arrestin complexes are known to be recruited into pre - existing CCPs after the ligand stimulation ( Rappoport and Simon , 2009 ; Scott et al . , 2002 ) . We observed the similar behavior of IGF - IR in live - cell TIRF - M ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4D ) . Notably , less IGF - IR was recruited to AP2 - posi - tive spots in the cells ectopically expressing IRS - 1 WT , but not 3YA mutant , suggesting that IRS - 1 interferes with the recruitment step of IGF - IR to clathrin - coated structures through competing out AP2 from IGF - IR . This will need to be tested by more detailed observation at higher resolution . The second key finding of this study is that the ability of IRS - 1 to promote surface retention of IGF - IR can be separable from Tyr phosphorylation - mediated signaling function of IRS - 1 . The Tyr resi - dues of the Yxx F motifs of IRS - 1 ( Tyr608 , 628 , and 658 ) critical for the binding to AP2 are part of Yoneyama et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e32893 .

We showed that ectopic expression of the IRS - 1 mutant D PTB led to the accumulation of active IGF - IR at cell surface to the same degree as that of IRS - 1 WT ( Figure 2 ) , indicating that IRS - 1 inhibits the internalization of IGF - IR in a manner independent of its Tyr phosphorylation . In addition , AP2 would preferentially bind non - phosphorylated IRS - 1 since AP2 cannot recognize phosphorylated Yxx F sequence due to its limited capacity ( Kittler et al . , 2008 ; Owen and Evans , 1998 ) . In line with this , our biochemical analyses support the notion that non - phosphorylated IRS - 1 acts as an inhibitory fac - tor for IGF - IR internalization via its interaction with AP2 ( Figure 9B ) . Our observation indicates that ectopic expression of IRS - 1 affects endocytosis of receptors other than IGF - IR . As long as we tested , endocytosis of integrin b 1 and EGFR , which could interact with IGF - IR , but not of TfR , was inhibited by IRS - 1 , raising the possibility that IRS - 1 influences endocytosis of cargoes in the close proximity of IGF - IR . As observed in our TIRF - M observation ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1D ) , a fraction of IRS - 1 has been demonstrated to localize to membrane - associated cytoskeleton ( Clark et al . , 1998 ) . IRS - 1 may locally regulate the specific cargo recruitment to CCPs through association with a portion of AP2 at the actin cytoskeleton . Indeed , preferred sites of endo - cytosis have been observed in some cargo proteins ( Grossier et al . , 2014 ; Weng et al . , 2014 ) , although the molecular mechanisms of such spatial regulation for IGF - IR and other cargos remain unknown . In addition to the role of IRS - 1 in controlling the rate of IGF - IR internalization , we found that this ability of IRS - 1 is negatively regulated by mTORC1 ( Figure 6 ) . mTORC1 has been reported to sup - press IGF - IR activity via its direct substrate Grb10 ( Yu et al . , 2011 ; Hsu et al . , 2011 ) . Our findings propose another mode of IGF - IR regulation by mTORC1 : mTORC1 feedback signaling leads to the degradation of IRS - 1 , which functions as a brake release to trigger IGF - IR internalization ( Figure 9B ) . Figure 9 . Model of IRS - 1 - mediated control for delayed IGF - IR internalization and its role in the sustained IGF signaling . ( A ) The canonical view in which IRS - 1 functions as a signaling mediator of IGF - IR to the PI3K - Akt pathway through their Tyr phosphorylation . The molecular basis for closed interactions between IGF - IR endocytosis and its signaling components has been poorly understood . ( B ) A proposed model for IRS - 1 - mediated surface retention of IGF - IR and sustained IGF signaling . The ability of IRS - 1 to interact with AP2 prolongs the surface retention of active IGF - IR , which is caused by the inhibition of AP2 - dependent IGF - IR internalization . After long - term stimulation of IGF , IRS - 1 is degraded by mTORC1 feedback signal , which functions as a brake release to trigger the initiation of IGF - IR internalization . Accelerating IGF - IR internalization caused by IRS - 1 depletion leads to the shift from sustained to transient Akt signaling .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 32893 17 of 34 Research article Biochemistry and Chemical Biology Cell Biology Hence , the time length needed for IRS - 1 degradation , which is critically regulated by mTORC1 , should determine the initiation timing of IGF - IR internalization . Receptor endocytosis is now considered to play both negative and positive roles in the down - stream signaling ( Goh and Sorkin , 2013 ) . Our data demonstrated that CME is required for long - term attenuation of activated IGF - IR ( Figure 3 ) . Previous studies have demonstrated that ligand - acti - vated IGF - IR is ubiquitinated and subsequently undergoes CME for its down - regulation ( Monami et al . , 2008 ; Zheng et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , the recycling of IGF - IR has been shown to in part contribute to sustained activation of Akt in response to IGF - I ( Romanelli et al . , 2007 ) . In this study we showed that stable expression of IRS - 1 inhibits ligand - dependent internalization of IGF - IR , leading to sustained activation of IGF - IR kinase and the downstream Akt signaling . This effect of IRS - 1 on prolonging the Akt signaling is likely based on two independent functions of IRS - 1 . First , the interaction of IRS - 1 with AP2 is required since expression of the IRS - 1 mutant 3YA could prolong nei - ther IGF - IR phosphorylation nor Akt phosphorylation in IGF - I - stimulated cells . Second , the ability of IRS - 1 to engage PI3K is also necessary because expression of the IRS - 1 mutant D PTB could prolong phosphorylation of IGF - IR but failed to sustain Akt phosphorylation ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1F ) . Similar signaling events were also observed in AP2 - depleted cells where IRS - 1 degradation , a consequence of negative feedback , was normally induced by long - term IGF - I stimulation ( Figure 7— figure supplement 1D , E ) . Notably , the ability to interact with AP2 , enhance the surface retention of IGF - IR , and prolong the Akt signaling is specific for IRS - 1 , but not for IRS - 2 . Thus , IRS - 1 can act as a pivotal modulator for IGF signaling duration via its control of IGF - IR internalization while the down - stream signaling activation can be mediated by either IRS - 1 or IRS - 2 ( Figure 9B ) . It is generally recognized that IGF - IR preferentially mediates growth whereas insulin receptor ( IR ) functions in glucose homeostasis in spite of the fact that both receptors share common signaling pathways mediated by the IRS proteins ( Accili et al . , 1996 ; Liu et al . , 1993 ; Nakae et al . , 2001 ) . However , these functional differences between IR and IGF - IR cannot be attributed to characteristics of the receptors themselves , such as their kinetics of ligand binding or their tissue / cellular distribu - tion ( Siddle , 2012 ) . Moreover , insulin levels fluctuate in response to the nutrients while IGF levels are constantly maintained by circulating IGF binding proteins and by paracrine / autocrine production ( Jones and Clemmons , 1995 ) . Yet , despite these differences in temporal pattern , this is unlikely to explain the specificity of IGF - IR and IR because even in cell culture these receptors mediate different bioactivities as well as gene expression profiles ( Lammers et al . , 1989 ; Palsgaard et al . , 2009 ) , including in a recent study using reconstituted model cell lines solely expressing either receptor ( Cai et al . , 2017 ) . While differential substrate preference for each receptors has been proposed to explain this specificity ( Cai et al . , 2017 ) , both receptors still induce signaling through the PI3K - Akt cascade and involve many IRS proteins ( White , 2002 ; Taniguchi et al . , 2006 ) . In addition , the Akt signaling cascade itself can produce different temporal dynamics in response to specific stimuli and to induce different cellular outcomes ( Gross and Rotwein , 2016 ; Kubota et al . , 2012 ) . Our study demonstrates that the IGF - IR pathway encodes prolonged Akt activation via IRS - 1 - mediated delay of IGF - IR internalization ( Figure 9B ) . In contrast , IR has been shown to undergo rapid CME in response to insulin ( Choi et al . , 2016 ; Morcavallo et al . , 2012 ) . These observations raise the possi - bility that the bioactive difference between IGF - IR and IR arises in part through their differential tem - poral activation of the PI3K - Akt pathway governed by CME kinetics unique to each receptor . In this context , future studies could productively address whether and how the CME of IGF - IR and IR are selectively regulated , which is also a general issue in the context of CME selectivity for multiple car - gos ( Grossier et al . , 2014 ; Weng et al . , 2014 ) . Notably , Choi et al . ( 2016 ) revealed that IR , but not IGF - IR , uses the receptor - associated adaptor BUBR1 / MAD2 to facilitate rapid CME by recruiting AP2 to IR . We are likely to better understand the role of differential endocytic regulation of IGF - IR and IR in temporal dynamics of the PI3K - Akt pathway when we identify the specific adaptors for IGF - IR and IR that engage their CME , and determine their relationship with IRS - 1 . Our results demonstrate that the prolonged Akt signaling elicited by IRS - 1 - mediated surface retention of IGF - IR affects the FoxO - targeting gene expression . Long - term action of IGF is funda - mental for various physiological aspects including growth control and neural cell survival ( Ness and Wood , 2002 ; Gross and Rotwein , 2016 ; Stewart and Rotwein , 1996 ) . Thus , IRS - 1 - mediated delay of IGF - IR internalization is likely to be a common mechanism for long - term IGF actions . Yoneyama et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e32893 .

Bacteria were grown in LB supplemented with ampicillin and chloramphenicol at 37 ˚ C to OD 600 of 0 . 7 . Expression was induced with 0 . 1 mM isopropyl b - D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) at 17 ˚ C over - night . The cells were harvested by centrifugation and homogenized with a sonicator in a buffer of 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 500 mM NaCl , 20 mM imidazole , 5 % glycerol , and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 supple - mented with cOmplete EDTA - free protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) .

Crystallization and structure determination Three eight - residue peptides of IRS - 1 were chemically synthesized with their sequences GY ( 608 ) MPMSPG , DY ( 628 ) MPMSPK and GY ( 658 ) MMMSPS , where the tyrosine residue in a Yxx F motif is indicated with its residue number in parentheses ( Toray Research Center , Inc . , Tokyo , Japan ) . Here - after , they are referred to as Y608 peptide , Y628 peptide , and Y658 peptide , respectively . The pep - tides were dissolved in 10 mM HEPES buffer ( pH 7 . 5 ) containing 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT . C - m 2 was mixed with each peptide in the molecular ratio of 1 : 10 . Crystals of the Y608 peptide were grown by the sitting drop method at 293 K with the reservoir solution containing 1 . 4 M sodium formate , 50 mM nickel chloride and 100 mM sodium acetate ( pH 6 . 0 ) . Crystals of the Y628 and Y658 peptides were grown by the hanging drop method at 291 K with the reservoir solution containing 2 . 2 – 2 . 3 M sodium chloride , 400 mM sodium potassium phosphate , 10 mM DTT , 15 % ( v / v ) glycerol and 100 mM MES ( pH 6 . 5 ) .

Diffraction data were collected on BL26B2 at SPring - 8 , Har - ima , Japan , and processed using HKL2000 ( Otwinowski and Minor , 1997 ) and the CCP4 suite ( Winn et al . , 2011 ) . Molecular replacement was carried out with CCP4 program MOLREP Yoneyama et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e32893 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 32893 28 of 34 Research article Biochemistry and Chemical Biology Cell Biology ( Vagin and Teplyakov , 1997 ) using the m 2 subunit in the complex with EGFR internalization signal peptide ( Owen and Evans , 1998 ) ( PDB 1BW8 ) as the search model . Refinement was performed with REFMAC5 ( Murshudov et al . , 1997 ) and PHENIX ( Adams et al . , 2010 ) , while model building was performed with COOT ( Emsley and Cowtan , 2004 ) . The N - terminal residue and residues 220 – 237 of C - m 2 were not modeled for the complexes of the Y628 and Y658 peptides . As for the complex with the Y608 peptide , it appeared that the region encompassing residues 219 – 260 underwent a conformational change where the electron density was not enough to precisely trace the structure . Residues 224 – 260 were not modeled except for a five - alanine strand which was placed as uncon - firmed residues in a patch of visible electron density . Structural models in the figures were drawn using PyMOL ( The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System , Schro¨dinger , LLC ) . Coordinates and structure factors of the three complexes have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) with accession codes indicated in Table 1 . Statistical analysis Comparisons between two groups were performed using two - tailed , unpaired Student’s t test , whereas comparisons among more than two groups were analyzed by analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and the Tukey post hoc test . p Values of < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant .
