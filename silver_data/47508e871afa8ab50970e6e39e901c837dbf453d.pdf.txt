Butler 1 & Harvey T . McMahon 1 The ability to actively remodel membranes in response to nucleo - tide hydrolysis has largely been attributed to GTPases of the dynamin superfamily , and these have been extensively studied 1 . Epsin homology ( EH ) - domain - containing proteins ( EHDs / RME - 1 / pincher ) comprise a less - well - characterized class of highly con - served eukaryotic ATPases implicated in clathrin - independent endocytosis 2 , and recycling from endosomes 3 , 4 . Here we show that EHDs share many common features with the dynamin super - family , such as a low affinity for nucleotides , the ability to tubulate liposomes in vitro , oligomerization around lipid tubules in ring - like structures and stimulated nucleotide hydrolysis in response to lipid binding . We present the structure of EHD2 , bound to a non - hydrolysable ATP analogue , and provide evidence consistent with a role for EHDs in nucleotide - dependent membrane remodelling in vivo . The nucleotide - binding domain is involved in dimeriza - tion , which creates a highly curved membrane - binding region in the dimer . Oligomerization of dimers occurs on another interface of the nucleotide - binding domain , and this allows us to model the EHD oligomer . We discuss the functional implications of the EHD2 structure for understanding membrane deformation . EHDs comprise a highly conserved eukaryotic protein family with four members ( EHD1 – 4 ) in mammals and a single member in Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophila melanogaster and in many eukaryotic parasites , such as the genera Plasmodium , Leishmania and Entamoeba . The proteins have a molecular mass of approxi - mately 60 kDa and contain an amino - terminal G - domain , followed by a helical domain and a carboxy - terminal EH - domain ( Fig . 1a ; in plant homologues the EH - domain is N - terminal ) . The EH - domain is known to interact with Asn - Pro - Phe ( NPF ) motifs in proteins involved in endocytosis . Overexpressed EHDs can be found on tubules inside cells and EHD family members ( including RME - 1 / EHD1 and pincher ) have been shown to regulate exit from the endocytic recycling compartment , TrkA - receptor - mediated macro - pinocytosis and other trafficking pathways 2 – 12 . Here we explore the structure and function of mouse EHD2 as a model for the EHD family . Mouse full - length EHD2 was expressed in bacteria and purified to homogeneity ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . The purified protein was nucleotide - free , as judged by HPLC analysis , and was dimeric in analytical velocity centrifugation ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . It was pre - viously reported that EHDs—despite havinga predicted G - domain— bind to adenine nucleotides 13 . We confirmed these results by using isothermal titration calorimetry : the affinities for ATP - c - S and ADP were 13 m M and 50 m M , respectively ( Fig . 1b ) . Nucleotide binding was Mg 2 1 - dependent ( data not shown ) . A mutation in the GKT motif in the phosphate - binding ( P - ) loop , T72A , prevented binding to ATP - c - S in a manner similar to that of equivalent mutations in other GTPases . No binding signal was observed for GTP - c - S ( Fig . 1b ) . We still refer to the N - terminal domain as a G - domain because of sequence and fold similarity ( see below ) to other G - domains . We investigated membrane - binding properties of EHD2 and found effi - cient binding to liposomes of brain - derived lipids ( Folch extract ) and to 100 % anionic phosphatidyl - serine ( PtdSer ) liposomes ( Fig . 1c ) . However , using synthetic liposomes containing different phosphatidyl inositols ( PtdIns ) and more stringent conditions ( only 10 % PtdSer , Fig . 1c ) , we observed preferential binding to liposomes containing PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) bisphosphate , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The consequence of membrane binding was analysed by electron microscopy , and we found that EHD2 deforms PtdSer liposomes in a nucleotide - independent manner into 20 - nm diameter tubules and oligomerizes in ring - like structures around these tubules ( Fig . 1d , and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Nucleotide independence of liposome tubulation in vitro was also observed for dynamin 1 . No noticeable tubule fission or alteration in tubule diameter was found for EHD2 in the presence of ATP . Frequently , we observed a complex network of connected tubules that had an extensive surface area , implying that there is considerable fusion occurring between liposomes ( Supple - mentary Fig . 3 ) . We also saw a few instances where EHD2 oligomeric rings were of variable diameter ( Fig . 1d , right panel ) suggesting that the interface used for EHD2 oligomerization is rather flexible . Folch liposomes were also tubulated by EHD2 in a nucleotide - independent manner ( data not shown ) . However , with synthetic liposomes con - taining only 2 . 5 % PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and in the absence of PtdSer , the amount of EHD binding was reduced , and in this less - favourable binding condition we only observed tubulation in the presence of ATP - c - S and ADP , but not in the absence of nucleotides ( Supple - mentary Fig . 3 ) . When enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) - tagged EHD2 was overexpressed in HeLa cells it marked punctate and tubular structures ( Fig . 1e , endogenous EHD2 in various cell lines shows a similar peripheral distribution 5 , 14 ) . By total internal reflection fluor - escence microscopy , those structures were mainly found close to the plasma membrane ( data not shown ) , consistent with the observed PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 specificity . Although the nucleotide - free T72A mutant bound to Folch liposomes in vitro ( Fig . 1c ) , it showed a cytoplasmic distribution when overexpressed in vivo ( Fig . 1e ) , indicating that nucleotide binding is required for oligomerization in vivo , in agree - ment with previous results 3 . The effect of membrane binding on the ATPase activity of EHD2 was monitored under multiple - turnover conditions ( tenfold excess of ATP over EHD2 ) , in the presence and absence of Folch liposomes ( Fig . 1f , and Supplementary Fig . 4 ) .

In contrast to GBP1 ( ref . 15 ) , we did not observe hydrolysis to nucleo - side mono - phosphate . GTP was not hydrolysed in the presence or absence of Folch liposomes , and the T72A mutant did not show membrane - stimulated ATPase activity . EHD2 displays a 600 - fold slower stimulated nucleotide hydrolysis than dynamin , which hydro - lyses GTP under our standard conditions ( see Methods ) with a k cat of < 1 s 2 1 . To obtain structural insights , we solved the crystal structure of EHD2 in the presence of the non - hydrolysable ATP analogue AMP - PNP ( see Methods , Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1 for the statistics ) . The nucleotide - binding domain of EHD2 possesses a typical G - domain fold with a central b - sheet surrounded by a - helices ( Fig . 2a , b , and Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . An AMP - PNP molecule occu - pies the canonical nucleotide - binding site . In comparison to the Ras - like G - domain , EHD2 contains an insertion of two additional b - strands in the switch I region , which are also present in the G - domain of dynamin 16 ( Fig . 2b ) . Surprisingly , switch I and switch II are not well ordered in this dimeric protein ( Fig . 2a ) . Residues 110 – 130 , which are distal to switch I , are disordered and contain predicted EH - domain binding motifs , KPFxxxNPF . In agreement with our biochemical analysis , EHD2 crystallizes as a dimer , and the dimer axis corresponds to a crystallographic two - fold axis ( Fig . 2a ) . Dimerization is mediated by a highly conserved , mostly hydrophobic interface of approximately 2 , 100 A˚ 2 in the G - domain ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . At the centre of the interface , the entirely conserved W238 in helix a 6 is buried in a hydrophobic pocket , and mutations of this residue render the protein insoluble ( data not shown ) . This novel interface is highly conserved among EHD family members and involves a different face of the G - domain to the dimer interfaces from the structurally characterized GBP1 and bacterial dynamin - like protein ( BDLP ) dimers 15 , 17 . The helical domain is composed of helix a 1 and a 2 from the N - terminal region ( residues 18 – 55 , which follow disordered residues 1 – 18 ) and helices a 8 to a 12 ( residues 285 – 400 ) following the G - domain ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Helix a 8 is the organizing scaffold against which most of the other helices fold . It also has extensive contacts with the G - domain . The dimeric G - domain , together with the helical region , adopts a scissor shape , in which the membrane is proposed to bind between the blades ( see later ) . Following the middle domain , a 40 - residue linker connects the helical domain with the C - terminal EH - domain ( residues 443 – 543 ) . The EH - domain of EHD2 is similar to the previously determined second EH - domain of Eps15 solved by NMR studies 18 , 19 , with a root mean squared deviation of 1 . 5 A˚ for the main - chain atoms ( Fig . 2c ) . It is built of two closely packed perpen - dicular EF hands , which are connected by a short b - sheet . We included a Ca 2 1 - ion in the second EF hand , which is ligated by four oxygens from acidic side chains and one main - chain carbonyl oxygen b Molar ratio ( nucleotides : EHD2 ) ∆∆ H p e r m o l e o f nu c l e o t i d e s ( ca l m o l – 1 ) ADP c 0 4 2 0 6 1 , 000 2 , 000 3 , 000 0 20 40 60 80 100 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 200 Time ( min ) PtdIns ( 4 ) P P PtdIns ( 3 ) P PtdIns S S S P P PtdIns ( 5 ) P S P S P S S P P S P S P Folch PtdSer P S P S 1 56 Helical G - domain Helical EH - domain Linker a d Folch P S 285 400 440 543 EHD2 T72A ATP - γ - S K D = 13 µ M K D = 50 µ M T72A - ATP - γ - S GTP - γ - S PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 No lipids Wild type T72A e f A T P r e m a i n i n g ( µ M ) 50 nm 50 nm 500 nm Figure 1 | EHD2 shares common properties with the dynamin superfamily . a , Domain structure of EHD proteins ( numbering from mouse EHD2 amino acids ) . b , EHD2 binds to adenine nucleotides , as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry .

The EH - domain is localized on top of the G - domain ( the top - site position ) with a buried interface of 1 , 600 A˚ 2 . Eighteen disordered residues connecting the EH - domain to the helical domain mean that it is ambiguous which EH - domain con - nects to which helical domain . We assign the EH - domains to oppos - ing monomers ( red Elt - domain belongs to the red helical domain in Fig . 2a ) because the last visible residue of the linker from the helical domain is closer to the opposite EH - domain ( distance 29 A˚ ) than to the superjacent EH - domain ( distance of 34 A˚ ) , and , in this latter case , the linker would have to wind around the EH - domain and thus one would expect to see some parts of this in the structure ( Fig . 2a ) . Unexpectedly , the peptide - binding sites of both EH - domains are occupied by a GPF motif ( residues 420 – 422 ) from the linker region ( Fig . 2a and c ) . The GPF motif adopts a similar conformation to an NPF - containing peptide bound to the EH2 domain of Eps15 ( ref . 18 ) , involving a tight turn with F422 projecting into a hydrophobic pocket that is lined by W490 at its base ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Fig . 7a ) . R536 in the C - terminal tail of the EH - domain points into the active site of the G - domain below and forms a hydrogen bond to D222 from the NKxD motif , which in other GTPases is responsible for specific recognition of the guanosine base ( see Supplementary Fig . 8 for details ) . Furthermore , M223 sterically prevents binding of GTP , thus explaining the ATP specificity of EHD2 . To test if a polybasic stretch close to the tip of the helical domain was involved in lipid binding , we monitored lipid binding of K327D , K328D and also F322A ( Fig . 3a ) . These mutants showed reduced liposome binding and ATPase activity in the presence of Folch lipo - somes ( Fig . 3b , c ) . In vivo , F322A , and every lysine to aspartate mutation of K324 , K327 , K328 , K329 , led to a cytoplasmic distri - bution of the protein ( Fig . 3d , and data not shown ) . Thus , the lipid interaction site of EHD2 is composed of two closely apposing lipid - binding sites in the dimer , leading to a highly curved mem - brane - binding interface ( Fig . 3a , and Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Under stringent binding conditions , EHD2 indeed showed a binding pre - ference for very small liposomes , consistent with this curvature , but only in the nucleotide - free form ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . In the nucleotide - bound form , EHD binding was not curvature - sensitive , and this is probably due to oligomer formation along an axis per - pendicular to the high curvature ( see below ) . In EHD2 , the phosphate groups of the AMP - PNP molecule are occluded from the exterior by a ‘phosphate cap’ that is formed by switch I and the P - loop , which would not allow the insertion of a catalytic residue in trans into the catalytic site ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . We searched for in cis catalytic residues and found that the switch I mutant T94A bound to ATP - c - S with nearly wild - type affin - ity and oligomerized around PtdSer liposomes , but did not show any membrane - stimulated ATPase activity ( Fig . 3e ) . This is consistent with a catalytic function for T94 . When overexpressed in HeLa cells , the T94A mutant labelled extensive tubular structures with essen - tially no punctate staining ( compare wild type and T94A in Fig . 3d , f and g , and Supplementary Movies 1 – 4 ) , suggesting that ATP hydro - lysis is involved in the break - down of tubular structures in vivo . We previously observed severely inhibited GTP hydrolysis and an extens - ive tubulation phenotype ( like that found with EHD2 T94A ) with dynamin 1 when T65 in switch I was mutated to alanine 20 . We ana - lysed another mutant in switch II , in which a glutamine was intro - duced close to the catalytic site . I157Q hydrolysed ATP faster than wild type , even in theabsence of membranes andtubulated liposomes ( Fig . 3e ) . When overexpressed in HeLa cells this protein labelled only very short tubules and puncta ( Fig . 3f , g ) . Many of these puncta were highly mobile as determined by live - cell microscopy ( Supplementary Movies 5 , 6 ) . Thus , there is a clear correlation between the measured ATP hydrolysis rates in vitro and the extent of tubule formation in vivo . The ATPase rates might be further stimulated in vivo , by binding partners or modifications . Altogether , these results are consistent with a role of EHD2 ATP hydrolysis in membrane remodelling and / or the scission of membranes in vivo . A highly conserved surface patch encompasses switch I , switch II and the surrounding area of the EHD2 dimer ( Fig . 4a ) . GBP1 and BDLP use this same interface , with the same relative orientation of the G - domains , for dimerization 15 , 17 . Thus , the EHD2 dimer may further oligomerize into the observed rings ( Fig . 1d ) using this sec - ond G - domain interface . This oligomerization probably leads to the ordering of residues in the switch regions , leading to increased nuc - leotide hydrolysis . Four single mutations of conserved surface - exposed residues in this interface did not affect lipid binding or oligomerization on liposomes but greatly reduced the liposome - stimulated ATPase reaction ( Fig . 4b , Supplementary Fig . 11a ) . The most drastic mutant , K193D , was further tested in vivo and showed extensive tubulation , whereas the E91Q mutant , which had the mild - est effect on the stimulated ATPase reaction , was indistinguishable from wild type in vivo ( Supplementary Fig . 11b ) .

LETTERS NATURE 4 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup consistent with this interface being involved in oligomerization - dependent reorientation of residues responsible for ATP hydrolysis . Using the dimeric GBP1 . GDP . AlF 3 G - domain structure 15 as a tem - plate and taking into account the observed 20 - nm ring of the EHD2 coat ( Fig . 1d ) , we predicted the arrangement of the EHD2 dimers within the oligomer , in which the nucleotides of two opposing EHD monomers are facing each other in a head - to - head fashion ( see Methods and Fig . 4c ) . The predicted oligomer has a compact struc - ture with a high degree of shape - complementarity between the oli - gomerizing dimers ( Supplementary coordinates ) . Furthermore , the membrane - binding sites are pointing in the same direction towards the putative membrane interface ( Fig . 4c , Supplementary Fig . 12a ) , and the thickness of the oligomeric ring agrees well with the thickness of the rings observed by electron microscopy ( < 10 nm , Fig . 1d ) . In the predicted oligomer , the highly curved membrane interface of the EHD2 dimer is oriented perpendicular to the direction of the tubule curvature ( Supplementary Fig . 12b , c ) . Furthermore , the disordered surface loop at the side of the G - domain containing the two con - served PF motifs ( NPF and KPF ) comes into the vicinity of the EH - domain linker ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Fig . 7b ) . Thus , we speculated that the EH - domain might switch position from the observed top site in the dimer in solution to the side - site position of the opposing dimer , during oligomerization ( Fig . 4c ) . Inter - estingly , only a side - site NPF peptide , and not the top - site GPF peptide , bound with a measurable affinity ( < 130 m M ) to the isolated EH - domain of EHD2 ( Supplementary Fig . 7c ) . Furthermore , in agreement with our prediction we observed that a deletion mutant of the EH - domain ( D EH ) or a double mutant of the two side - site xPF motifs ( F122A / F128A ) did not show any membrane - stimulated ATPase activity ( Fig . 4b ) , and we did not find any regular oligomers on liposomes in electron microscopy studies for these mutants ( see Supplementary Fig . 7 for further discussion ) . On the basis of the conservation of structural and mechanistic elements we propose to expand the dynamin superfamily to include other multidomain large G - domain proteins such as EHDs and BDLPs . The structure outlined above , the architecture of the mem - brane interaction site and the proposed oligomer provide a frame - work to understand membrane remodelling for the EHD family , and perhaps for dynamin superfamily members . The EHD2 dimer inter - acts with membranes via ionic interactions mediated by a highly curved interface and we predict that this interaction results in the insertions of V321 and F322 into the hydrophobic phase of the lipid bilayer . Both the curved interface and the hydrophobic residue insertions ( see synaptotagmin 21 ) will result in the bending of the membrane towards the EHD2 dimer ( buckling ) . The membrane curvature imposed by our proposed oligomer would be perpendic - ular to the curvature imposed by the concave membrane - binding face of the EHD2 dimer ( Supplementary Fig . 12b ) . This would cause considerable curvature stress in the lipid bilayer and would thus facilitate the lipid rearrangement required for the formation of intermediate stages towards membrane fission / fusion 22 . Finally we observe that nucleotide hydrolysis is most probably leading to mem - brane scission in vivo , and thus we would argue that conformational changes induced by nucleotide hydrolysis are transmitted through helix 8 to the membrane - binding interface leading to further mem - brane destabilization .

NATURE LETTERS 5 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup METHODS Protein expression and structure determination . Mouse EHD2 full - length protein , the D EH - domain construct ( amino acids 1 – 404 ) and all mutants were expressed as N - terminal His - fusions followed by a PreScission cleavage site in Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 Rosetta ( Novagen ) from a modified pET28 vector . Bacterial cultures in TB medium were induced at a OD 600 of 0 . 2 with 40 m M IPTG , and grown overnight at 18 u C . Bacteria were lysed in 50mM HEPES ( pH7 . 5 ) , 400mM NaCl , 25mM imidazole , 2 . 5mM b - mercaptoethanol , 500 m M Pefablock SC ( Boehringer Ingelheim ) using an Emulsiflex homogenizer ( Avestin ) . After centrifugation at 100 , 000g for 45min at 4 u C , the soluble extract was applied to a NiNTA - column ( Qiagen ) equilibrated with lysis buffer . The column was extensively washed with 20mM HEPES ( pH7 . 5 ) , 700mM NaCl , 30mM imidazole , 2 . 5mM b - mercaptoethanol , 1mM ATP , 10mM KCl , and shortly with 20mM HEPES ( pH7 . 5 ) , 300mM NaCl , 25mM imidazole , 2 . 5mM b - mercaptoethanol . Bound protein was eluted with 20mM HEPES ( pH7 . 5 ) , 300mM NaCl , 100mM imidazole , 2 . 5mM b - mercaptoethanol , and dialysed overnight at 4 u C against 20mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 300mM NaCl , 2 . 5mM b - mercaptoethanol in the presence of 250 m g PreScission protease to cleave the His - tag . The protein was re - applied to a NiNTA column to which it bound under these buffer conditions in the absence of the His - tag . The column was extensively washed with 20mM HEPES , 300mM NaCl , 2 . 5mM b - mercaptoethanol , and the protein finally eluted with 20mM HEPES , 300mM NaCl , 2 . 5mM b - mercaptoethanol , 25mM imidazole , concentrated and further purified using a Sephadex200 size - exclusion column ( two conse - cutive runs for proteins used for the ATPase assays ) . Typical yields were 4mg of purified EHD2 / 1 bacterial culture . At 300mM NaCl , we could concentrate the protein to 40mgml 2 1 , but at lower salt concentration we observed some pre - cipitation at this protein concentration . The protein was partially stabilized by 1mM MgCl 2 . ATPase assays . Multiple turnover ATPase assays were performed in 20mM HEPES ( pH7 . 5 ) , 135mM NaCl , 15mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 at 30 u C with 10 m M EHD2 ( or mutants ) as enzyme and 100 m M ATP as substrate , in the absence or presence of 1mgml 2 1 sonicated Folch ( Sigma - Aldrich ) liposomes , with an average diameter of 135nm , as determined by dynamic light scattering . ReactionswerestartedbytheadditionoftheproteintothefinalreactionmixandnucleotidehydrolysiswasfollowedusingstandardHPLCmeasurement 23 . Initial ratesweredeterminedbyapplyingalinearfittodatapointsupto40 % nucleotide hydrolysis . For the dynamin reaction , 1 m M of protein with 1mM of GTP as substrate has been used . Crystallization and structure determination . For crystallization , a selenomethionine - substituted point mutant Q410A was prepared , as described 24 . This mutant showed identical biochemical properties as the wild - type protein but displayed less degradation in the linker region when incubated over longer periods of time . The protein was concentrated to 40mgml 2 1 and supplemented with 4mM MgCl 2 , 2mM AMP - PNP ( Sigma - Aldrich ; both final concentrations ) . The hanging - drop vapour - diffusion method was used for crys - tallization . Protein solution ( 2 m l ) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 3 % PEG2000 MME , 50mM MES ( pH6 . 4 ) , 4mM MgCl 2 . Crystals appeared after one week at 4 u C and had dimensions of < 0 . 2 3 0 . 2 3 0 . 05mm 3 . For flash - freezing in liquid nitrogen , they were first transferred for 10s into 50mM MES ( pH6 . 4 ) , 75mM NaCl , 4mM MgCl 2 , 2mM AMP - PNP , 14 % MPD before incubation in the final cryo - solution containing 50mM MES ( pH6 . 4 ) , 75mM NaCl , 4mM MgCl 2 , 2mM AMP - PNP , 27 % MPD . No crystals were obtained in the presence of ADP or in nucleotide - free conditions . One data set at the selenium peak wavelength was collected from a single crystal at the ESRF beamline ID14 - EH4 ( see Supplementary Table 1 ) and pro - cessed and scaled using the Xds program suite 25 . Crystals belonged to the mono - clinic crystal system and contained one molecule in the asymmetric unit . Thirteen out of sixteen selenium atoms were found from SHELXD 26 using the anomalous signal of the data set . Selenium sites were refined and initial phases were calculated using the program SHARP 27 . In the resulting electron density , themainchainwasclearlytraceable , andaninitialmodelcouldbebuiltusingthe XtalView package 28 . The model was refined using Refmac5 ( ref . 29 ) with 3 TLS groups ( Table 1 ) . The asymmetric unit contains 477 amino acids , one AMP - PNP , onemagnesium , onecalciumandfivewatermoleculesandhasanexcellent geometry with all residues in the favoured and most favoured region of the Ramachandran plot as judged by the program Procheck 30 . Ribbon plots were prepared using the program Molscript 31 and rendered with Raster3D 32 . Surface conservationplotswerepreparedusingtheConSurfserver 33 andCcp4molecular graphics 34 . ElectronpotentialmapsweregeneratedusingCcp4moleculargraph - ics . AllothersurfacerepresentationswerepreparedusingPymol 35 . Topredictthe arrangement of the EHD2 dimer in the oligomer , two EHD2 dimers were super - imposed with one of the two monomers of the GBP1 . GDP . AlF 3 - dimer ( PDB code 2B92 ) using Swisspdb viewer 36 . The EHD2 dimers were manually re - aligned to avoid amino acid clashes such that the two - fold axis between the oligomerizing EHD2 monomers was maintained . A high degree of shape com - plementarity between the EHD2 dimers in the resulting tetramer supported this approach ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . Furthermore , the lipid - binding sites of both EHD2dimersareexpectedtocontactthemembrane , andthisrestraintisfulfilled in the tetramer . To obtain a 20nm ring , an 18 u tilt was introduced between the dimers . We refrained from energy - minimising of this structure because major conformational changes in the interface are expected to take place on oligomer - ization ( ordering of switchI and switchII ) and the resolution of the structure is not appropriate for an accurate prediction . The programs Superpose and PdbsetfromCcp4 ( ref . 37 ) wereusedtogeneratetheoligomerfromthetetramer . PDB coordinates of the proposed oligomer are found in the Supplementary Materials . Additional movies of the EHD structure will be posted on http : / / www . endocytosis . org / EHDs / . Ultracentrifugation . Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XLA ultracentrifuge , using an An - 60Ti rotor . Centrifugation was at 50 , 000revolutions min 2 1 and 5 u C at an EHD2 concentration of 15 m M , with scans as fast as possible ( , 1 . 5min intervals ) . The data were analysed using DCDT 1 v . 2 ( refs 38 , 39 ) , with the partial specific volume for the protein ( from the amino acid composition ) and solvent density and viscosity calculated using Sednterp 40 . Selected scans ( at equal , , 15min intervals ) , of g ( s 20 , w ) ( the amount of material sedimenting between s 20 , w and s 20 , w 1 d s ) and also the residuals for fitting the data with DCDT 1 , were plotted with the program Profit v . 5 . 6 . 7 ( Quantum soft ) . Cell biology . Amino - terminal EGFP - tagged EHD2 and all mutants were over - expressed in HeLa cells from the pEGFP - C3 vector ( Clontech ) . HeLa cells were grown in DMEM containing 10 % fetal bovine serum and transfected using Genejuice ( Novagen ) for transient protein expression . Twenty four hours after transfection , cells were fixed for 20min at 37 u C in 3 . 2 % paraformaldehyde and mounted . All confocal images were taken sequentially using a BioRad Radiance system and LaserSharp software ( Biorad ) . For real - time microscopy , transfected cells on glass - bottom Petri dishes ( WillCo Wells BV ) were washed with 25mM HEPES ( pH7 . 5 ) , 125mM NaCl , 5mM KCl , 10mM D - glucose , 1mM MgCl 2 , 2mM CaCl 2 , and epifluorescence images were taken using an Olympus IX70 microscope ( Southhall ) and Argon laser ( Melles Griot ) with a Princeton in - struments ( Trenton ) - cooled I - PentaMAX camera with MetaMorph software ( Universal imaging ) . 23 .
